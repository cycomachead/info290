not
a
bad
black
ipa
but
not
the
best
ive
had
either
otter
creek
has
made
its
final
run
of
black
ipa
and
copper
ale
black
pour
with
small
tan
head
aroma
of
citrus
malt
and
some
alcohol
initial
sweet
and
malty
flavor
yields
to
a
hoppy
yet
smooth
and
clean
finish
pleasant
aftertaste
of
roast
not
as
complex
as
some
of
the
others
ive
tried
however
it
is
a
decent
beer
interesting
dark
amber
black
when
held
to
light
tan
head
about
1
5
inches
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pub
glass
moderate
lacing
on
glass
herbal
pine
and
smoked
nutty
nose
smoky
nutty
malt
flavor
dominates
hoppy
bitterness
creating
an
interesting
and
surprising
contrast
not
unpleasant
but
to
me
it
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
mouthfeel
is
muddled
somewhat
soft
for
an
ipa
but
the
bite
seems
to
come
from
the
carbonation
and
smokiness
of
the
dark
roast
malt
than
from
the
hop
bitters
great
beer
started
this
snowy
night
with
a
taste
of
this
thick
dark
ipa
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
smooth
but
just
enough
flavor
nice
aroma
looks
good
enough
to
drink
poured
in
a
clear
pint
glass
overall
i
would
easily
recommend
this
beer
to
others
and
drink
it
again
cheers
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
smooth
and
very
tasty
great
a
a
a
a
it
was
decent
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
ipas
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
the
biggest
fan
of
otter
creek
in
general
but
the
black
ipa
which
drinks
more
like
a
black
ale
not
as
hoppy
as
typical
ipas
was
very
good
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
almost
no
head
good
lacing
5
minutes
after
the
pour
smell
is
typical
of
a
black
ipa
though
less
inviting
than
most
ive
had
smells
of
the
dark
malts
used
and
of
hops
thats
all
i
got
anyways
taste
is
of
pine
and
smokiness
again
typical
of
a
black
ipa
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
carbonation
is
just
right
a
hint
more
could
even
be
taken
overall
nothing
great
but
with
a
limited
craft
beer
selection
at
the
local
gas
station
itll
do
poured
from
bottle
aroma
of
coffee
almost
completely
black
with
minimal
head
mild
taste
full
bodied
creamy
texture
overall
a
really
great
brew
i
was
tasting
other
ipas
while
drinking
this
so
it
tasted
very
much
like
a
stout
to
me
i
would
be
curious
to
try
this
with
other
stouts
to
make
that
comparison
good
color
almost
black
head
was
about
2
fingers
maybe
a
little
more
head
developed
quickly
and
held
for
a
decent
amount
of
time
flavor
is
malty
with
a
little
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
just
a
tad
too
sweet
for
me
as
far
as
ipas
go
but
overall
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
overall
my
introduction
to
black
ipas
different
for
sure
not
unpleasant
but
different
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
up
this
style
again
but
its
good
bmfr
overall
a
solid
brew
not
too
sweet
for
dark
ipa
but
not
quite
enough
hop
presence
to
get
it
too
stand
out
yet
very
drinkable
o
after
the
disaster
of
a
pour
i
expected
things
to
continue
to
be
bad
for
this
one
however
everything
is
in
balance
nice
balance
of
hops
low
bitter
some
smoky
cocoa
on
the
finish
and
really
smooth
mouth
feel
i
would
like
to
drink
this
one
again
overall
excellent
session
beer
lots
of
flavor
in
an
allseason
style
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
faint
garnet
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
decent
sized
creamy
beige
head
that
persists
for
a
good
long
time
before
sticking
lots
of
lace
to
the
sides
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
with
a
hint
of
caramel
and
some
light
earth
and
citrus
notes
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
to
a
t
roast
and
light
chocolate
and
caramel
with
a
light
earthy
hop
flavor
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
almost
gritty
mouthfeel
virtually
non
existent
hop
aroma
makes
me
want
to
call
this
a
porter
or
dry
stout
the
flavor
has
some
hop
to
it
but
the
beer
in
this
bottle
is
either
old
or
there
arent
enough
hops
in
here
to
call
this
an
ipa
meh
o
a
good
brew
id
have
another
one
a
deep
brown
almost
black
pour
with
2
fingers
of
fluffy
tan
head
great
lacing
and
slow
dissipation
the
aroma
is
a
bit
off
putting
rust
coconut
soap
coffee
definitely
intriguing
the
flavor
is
much
better
thankfully
a
mellow
arrangement
of
chocolate
roasted
grains
and
grassy
hops
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
to
distinguish
it
from
a
stout
a
bit
too
herbal
for
my
preference
but
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
by
any
means
i
think
my
tastes
either
changed
over
time
or
i
grew
tired
of
this
newer
style
this
bottle
came
out
of
a
mixed
12
pack
bottled
in
early
january
either
way
dont
let
my
opinion
stop
you
from
trying
this
beer
its
a
great
start
for
those
who
wish
to
explore
american
black
ales
this
beer
sits
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
a
black
ipa
but
finds
a
way
to
work
its
certainly
challenging
enough
to
take
your
time
with
yet
drinkable
enough
to
put
several
away
well
done
o
a
really
solid
beer
that
stands
out
more
with
food
paired
it
with
shepherds
pie
on
a
second
tasting
and
it
matched
up
well
on
a
cold
rainy
new
england
night
with
comfort
food
d
average
at
best
in
terms
of
both
style
and
overall
beerdom
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
just
kind
of
there
i
would
have
never
known
this
was
an
american
black
ale
if
it
werent
listed
on
the
able
seems
to
closer
resemble
either
a
milk
stout
or
foreign
export
stout
i
would
neither
recommend
nor
revisit
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
for
sure
easy
to
put
down
several
of
these
but
of
course
with
such
drinkability
often
comes
a
lack
of
richness
body
and
flavor
still
a
solid
brew
though
o
it
was
fresh
but
the
hops
dont
make
it
to
ipa
grade
for
me
pale
ale
perhaps
still
a
decent
drink
serving
type
bottle
this
is
better
than
most
a
rich
and
decadent
brew
now
available
yearround
it
has
a
nice
chalky
dark
brown
color
to
it
with
a
fluffy
lighter
brown
head
and
a
nose
of
chocolate
malts
cocoa
bitter
hops
and
oatmeal
the
hops
balance
but
do
not
dominate
as
they
usually
do
in
this
style
and
i
find
this
to
be
a
real
nicely
put
together
beer
very
approachable
my
palate
is
greeted
by
warming
chocolate
notes
from
the
malt
long
before
i
get
any
hops
which
in
the
end
turn
out
to
be
more
bitter
than
flavorful
which
i
think
works
well
with
the
dark
roasted
barley
full
bodied
creamy
feel
to
this
thick
and
delicious
down
easy
for
what
it
is
one
of
otter
creeks
better
beers
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
from
the
first
sip
none
of
the
tropical
fruit
tones
which
i
typically
associate
with
cascadian
and
this
style
but
enough
going
on
that
ill
definitely
buy
it
again
more
of
a
hoppy
porter
id
like
more
hop
flavour
in
a
black
ipa
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
no
black
ipa
the
fact
that
black
ipas
are
put
under
the
style
american
black
ale
on
here
muddies
the
waters
even
further
im
wary
of
falling
into
the
trend
of
calling
every
hoppy
beer
india
but
there
really
needs
to
be
two
separate
styles
if
it
were
up
to
me

featuring
all
the
aspects
of
a
dark
brewcifix
not
a
bad
black
ipa
o
a
tasty
black
ipa
featuring
more
darkly
roasted
malts
yet
with
only
a
limited
and
quite
acceptable
burnt
quality
rich
and
moderately
complex
this
is
a
very
big
beer
for
6
abv
o
this
is
a
great
blend
for
a
black
ipa
while
this
could
use
more
hops
its
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
full
of
good
flavors
dead
black
ipa
one
of
the
darkest
ipas
weve
reviewed
decent
head
hoppy
ipa
aroma
hoppy
chocolate
toasted
caramel
notes
in
taste
mix
a
porter
and
an
ipa
if
you
love
ipa
and
wish
it
was
darker
this
is
the
beer
for
you
really
strikes
as
a
dark
pale
ale
or
ipa
would
go
great
with
a
cannoli
or
a
sweet
dessert
would
definitely
not
work
historically
however
is
a
great
dark
variety
overall
pretty
nice
black
ale
will
look
for
more
of
this
in
the
future
o
not
bad
at
all
its
a
little
less
complex
than
the
black
ipas
i
really
like
but
im
very
glad
i
tried
this
one
o
this
was
enjoyable
but
bit
super
complex
you
decide
whether
thats
good
or
bad
but
i
liked
it
definately
worth
a
try
but
not
the
bipa
ive
ever
had
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
amberbrown
into
black
coloring
with
a
frothy
filmy
low
profile
light
tan
head
that
quickly
disipates
across
the
surface
aromas
of
roasted
grains
citrus
highlights
of
grapefruit
and
tangerine
and
a
resiny
rich
hops
presence
not
overpowering
on
the
nose
and
very
well
balanced
flavors
of
roast
and
hops
hit
the
palate
at
the
same
time
with
a
bitter
campfire
balancing
the
bitter
floral
and
tree
sap
punch
of
the
hops
some
of
the
citrus
shines
through
on
the
midtongue
allowing
a
break
from
the
more
intense
flavors
you
get
on
the
first
sip
the
aftertaste
is
more
bitter
and
slightly
tangy
with
the
citrus
and
hops
now
taking
the
drivers
seat
smooth
bodied
with
a
clean
slightly
drying
finish
very
tasty
brew
o
i
liked
this
as
it
was
almost
two
beers
in
one
as
the
hop
flavor
melted
into
more
of
a
brown
ale
i
do
not
like
overhopped
ales
and
this
one
had
a
quickhitting
hop
flavor
that
dissipated
pretty
quick
i
found
this
very
drinkable
and
yet
another
smooth
offering
from
otter
creek
i
will
definitely
try
again
45
o
while
the
taste
is
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
smell
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nice
roasty
malts
with
not
overpowering
ipa
hops
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
a
great
deal
considering
how
inexpensive
it
was
o
this
is
a
touch
roastier
and
a
touch
lower
in
hop
aroma
and
flavor
than
i
would
have
liked
but
all
around
this
is
a
nice
black
ipa
a
style
i
enjoy
and
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
style
that
i
have
had
feels
medium
in
body
and
dry
to
the
palate
o
a
very
good
and
affordable
black
ipa
its
not
the
best
but
for
the
price
it
is
a
steal
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
goto
beer
or
something
that
can
be
drank
for
an
entire
evening
not
just
one
or
two
this
is
my
new
goto
beer
very
reasonable
at
8
50
per
sixpack
it
is
as
black
as
a
trojan
horse
at
midnight
with
a
beautiful
coffee
colored
head
malty
attack
with
a
nice
dry
hoppy
finish
wonderfully
balanced
with
enough
intrigue
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
in
an
age
of
extreme
beers
this
one
has
just
the
right
blend
of
restraint
vs
excitment
i
could
drink
this
beer
everyday
and
i
just
might
o
this
beer
was
ok
nothing
to
brag
about
it
tasted
good
but
was
very
watery
and
not
to
hoppy
o
really
solid
black
ipa
well
thought
out
and
with
an
excellent
drinkability
seek
it
out
45
ohighly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
fuses
two
of
my
favorite
styles
ipas
and
stouts
into
one
great
beer
would
get
a
higher
rating
if
the
ipa
part
of
the
name
would
come
through
more
in
the
overall
aroma
and
taste
great
beer
none
the
less
this
had
a
slight
kick
to
it
but
nothing
that
would
knock
anyone
over
even
though
i
only
bought
one
bottle
i
could
probably
down
a
few
of
these
at
once
since
this
was
quite
drinkable
i
like
beers
of
this
style
to
be
a
bit
more
bold
since
this
is
a
groundbreaking
category
of
sorts
but
anyone
who
has
never
tried
something
of
this
nature
before
would
be
well
versed
to
start
with
this
beer
the
nose
on
this
one
really
struck
me
as
more
malty
and
chocolatey
than
i
would
expect
from
this
style
the
flavor
is
a
bit
different
than
what
im
usually
getting
from
the
black
ales
but
this
is
an
okay
version
of
the
style
perhaps
its
an
issue
of
preference
this
one
works
and
is
certainly
no
trainwreck
but
the
finer
points
of
others
win
me
over
just
a
bit
more
o
never
had
a
black
ipa
before
but
it
seems
to
blend
well
the
characters
of
an
ipa
with
a
dark
porter
or
a
light
stout
very
pleasant
surprise
from
such
an
underrated
brewer
this
is
a
decent
black
ipa
its
malt
forward
but
theres
an
obviously
heavy
hop
presence
the
hops
are
a
bit
at
odds
with
the
malt
however
the
malt
is
bitter
and
roasty
and
the
hops
are
citrusy
a
bit
of
balance
would
be
nice
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
again
this
is
a
good
but
not
great
version
of
a
black
ale
overall
nice
beer
not
as
good
as
other
black
ipas
the
taste
is
a
little
off
for
the
style
more
stout
or
porter
like
still
a
good
beer
though
just
to
the
right
if
light
bodied
drinks
easy
enough
id
call
this
a
pretty
good
middle
of
the
road
for
the
style
having
a
small
yet
growing
appreciation
for
the
black
ipas
i
came
across
the
otter
creek
brewing
ocb
edition
while
making
a
sixpack
for
the
weekend
first
taste
was
actually
a
little
rough
as
the
hops
actually
flew
out
of
the
bottle
and
assaulted
my
poor
taste
buds
drinking
straight
from
the
bottle
about
a
quarter
of
the
way
in
the
taste
softened
a
bit
or
my
tongue
was
numbed
either
way
the
ocb
was
evolving
into
a
very
drinkable
beverage
not
quite
sure
what
the
aftertaste
reminds
me
of
but
it
is
pleasant
and
does
not
leave
the
harsh
wash
some
ipas
do
i
imagine
it
would
go
well
with
a
peppered
cheese
snack
if
youre
into
that
kind
of
thing
overall
an
aboveaverage
entry
and
one
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
enjoy
again
where
this
beer
tends
to
fall
in
the
average
category
is
the
nose
and
appearance
nothing
wrong
it
just
doesnt
really
stand
out
enough
to
pour
it
out
into
a
glass
its
the
balance
and
tempered
nature
of
the
brew
that
keeps
it
in
my
rotation
oa
decent
drinking
beer
but
needs
better
balance
asmalt
dominates
more
than
i
would
like
in
conclusion
this
is
a
solid
black
ale
there
were
many
similarities
to
the
2011
sierra
nevada
beer
camp16
juniper
black
ale
which
was
almost
a
4
0
rating
in
my
opinion
brew
is
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
had
the
lower
abv
makes
this
one
you
can
drink
all
night
great
stuff
here
o
enjoyable
enough
pleasing
balance
but
more
a
lighterbodied
porter
than
anything
else
would
buy
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
darker
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
body
kinda
thick
moderate
carbonation
definitely
would
get
again
but
again
tastes
more
like
a
porter
overall
an
interesting
beerto
me
tasted
more
like
a
porter
than
an
ipa
but
this
is
probably
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
so
far
o
im
usually
not
a
big
bipa
fan
but
i
dug
this
one
quite
a
bit
the
best
in
the
otter
creek
snack
pack
imo
d
really
well
done
black
ipa
that
avoids
the
major
pitfalls
inherent
to
the
style
maybe
not
at
the
sublime
level
of
hill
farmsteads
offerings
but
pretty
excellent
for
a
beer
available
in
sixpacks
at
the
local
store
would
happily
drink
this
one
again
overall
this
is
a
good
tasting
ipa
very
good
for
those
who
would
like
to
try
an
ipa
but
might
be
put
off
by
the
bitterness
of
some
ipas
well
flavored
and
balanced
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
market
basket
in
somersworth
pours
a
black
body
with
slight
rubyred
highlights
and
and
an
impressive
inch
or
so
of
khakicolored
head
with
some
decent
lacing
espresso
bean
and
grapefruit
share
the
aroma
fairly
equally
espresso
hits
the
palate
first
with
grapefruit
and
lemon
hitting
soon
thereafter
to
balance
medium
in
body
and
carbonation
a
bit
more
maltforward
than
other
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
but
its
good
the
roasty
malt
and
citrissy
hops
compliment
each
other
quite
nicely
terrific
i
just
love
this
beer
its
a
great
departure
from
a
standard
ipa
andor
stout
not
sure
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
fits
the
bill
i
will
get
this
whenever
i
can
nice
blend
of
hops
roasted
malt
malty
sweetness
and
hints
of
toffee
medium
bodied
mildly
bitter
finish
glad
they
finally
decided
to
brew
this
one
yearround
the
malt
body
is
prominent
enough
to
present
some
bold
flavors
while
holding
everything
together
just
long
enough
to
give
the
hops
a
moment
to
shine
as
well
really
gets
your
tongue
thinking
coffee
roasted
barley
burnt
toast
citric
and
flowery
hops
with
a
touch
of
pine
its
all
there
in
one
deep
swell
of
a
sip
interesting
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
and
thickness
of
the
liquid
is
well
balanced
this
feature
is
a
plus
for
drinkability
the
lack
of
bitterness
would
make
this
ipa
along
with
its
texture
a
good
match
for
a
lighter
flavored
food
pairing
than
the
usual
ipa
recommendations
overall
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
black
ipas
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
if
you
have
never
had
a
black
ipa
this
one
will
tell
you
what
they
are
supposed
to
taste
like
it
is
not
merely
an
ipa
in
dark
clothing
instead
it
takes
the
hop
and
malt
notes
of
a
good
ipa
and
combines
them
with
the
roasted
notes
of
a
good
porter
d
the
hoppy
nose
was
rather
deceiving
as
the
roasted
malt
was
dominant
all
the
way
through
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
brew
and
highly
drinkable
i
havent
tried
many
black
ipas
but
this
one
leaves
a
good
impression
of
the
style
o
i
loved
this
black
ipa
really
enjoyed
the
combination
of
hops
and
malts
its
not
bad
at
all
but
im
not
jumping
out
of
my
seat
overall
solid
beer
not
the
best
black
ipa
but
worth
a
taste
i
would
seek
out
again
this
is
a
worthy
addition
to
the
style
but
not
my
favorite
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
given
my
first
foray
into
the
style
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
again
in
the
near
future
unlike
some
brews
of
this
genre
this
beer
actually
fits
the
style
it
has
good
balance
in
the
palate
and
doesnt
seem
like
a
hoppy
stout
or
an
ipa
with
added
color
the
nose
is
hop
forward
with
subtle
chocolate
notes
the
piney
hops
are
countered
with
lighty
roasted
grain
and
really
seems
to
all
come
together
on
the
tongue
a
nice
suprise
from
ocb
in
a
style
that
i
typically
shy
away
from
cheers
o
this
is
a
very
good
dark
ipa
the
only
other
ive
had
is
hop
in
the
dark
by
deschutes
and
this
one
is
way
better
highly
recommend
d
not
as
much
hop
brightness
vividness
but
it
does
have
bitterness
and
character
similarly
it
nails
the
roasty
but
without
the
malty
depth
roundness
of
some
others
hint
more
than
enough
of
the
right
notes
to
be
well
within
style
and
it
is
rather
tasty
and
drinkable
good
but
not
special
o
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
one
i
find
most
black
ipas
lack
the
ipa
and
are
just
focused
on
the
deep
malts
this
one
has
a
really
nice
balance
and
is
really
drinkable
the
tast
has
a
mild
bitter
taste
with
slight
pine
accent
up
front
and
mild
toasted
grain
which
has
low
roast
notes
and
slight
peppery
quality
the
actual
hop
flavor
is
pretty
nice
with
kind
of
comes
off
as
grassyy
with
mild
flavor
of
stone
fruit
from
the
yeast
adding
to
the
overall
sweetness
and
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
with
no
lack
of
hop
flavor
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
in
the
style
for
me
it
is
a
good
choice
but
still
just
above
average
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
slick
black
with
a
one
inch
light
tan
head
with
beautiful
lace
and
good
retention
smell
is
citrus
pine
chocolate
and
toffee
taste
is
very
big
a
big
hit
of
coffee
to
go
with
all
the
flavors
in
the
nose
body
is
large
for
the
abv
lots
of
life
medium
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
7
99
a
six
pack
it
is
the
best
black
ila
for
the
dollar
i
have
seen
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
for
6
the
alcohol
is
well
integrated
for
a
style
i
normally
dont
totally
get
this
one
was
pretty
enjoyable
because
of
the
balance
of
flavors
and
uniqueness
if
i
had
to
drink
this
style
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
if
you
really
dig
this
style
though
this
is
one
to
seek
out
overall
this
is
one
good
beer
the
best
of
anything
i
have
tried
with
wolversotter
creek
and
a
beer
that
is
excellent
as
a
standard
go
to
eric
o
this
is
good
for
its
style
and
great
to
me
o
not
a
style
i
love
but
this
is
pretty
good
as
they
go
not
a
bad
little
beer
it
isnt
intense
by
any
stretch
but
it
has
a
nice
balanced
feel
to
it
without
forgetting
its
an
ipa
making
for
a
nice
drinkability
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
m
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
bringing
both
flavors
im
morethanample
proportions
wellroasted
and
supercitrusy
i
ended
up
having
two
glasses
o
well
ill
rereview
if
i
ever
get
a
better
bottle
the
infection
kills
this
one
it
tastes
bad
and
thats
why
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
the
flavors
are
mild
and
well
blended
but
the
citrus
and
bitter
hop
bite
is
certainly
not
covered
up
or
overly
subdued
a
good
beer
and
i
would
like
to
try
more
of
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
a
little
creamy
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
of
the
style
the
hops
definitely
stood
out
in
it
but
the
roasted
malts
definitely
were
evident
as
well
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
too
filling
nice
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
i
have
to
admit
i
dont
get
the
black
ipa
style
the
hops
and
the
roasted
flavors
seem
to
be
struggling
against
each
other
in
most
other
black
ipas
ive
tried
this
contrast
of
flavors
doesnt
really
work
well
for
me
but
otter
creek
seems
to
get
the
balance
right
if
you
want
some
roasted
flavor
to
back
up
your
ipa
then
this
is
the
beer
for
you
it
is
a
bit
more
smokey
tasting
than
roasty
it
looks
good
in
a
glass
with
nice
lacing
but
pitch
black
it
has
a
unique
but
appropriate
taste
o
decent
wonder
why
they
call
it
an
ipa
i
expected
more
hops
instead
its
closer
to
a
porter
i
think
good
body
and
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
recommended
bottled
101111
so
just
about
1
5mos
old
black
of
course
with
a
tan
head
attractive
enough
but
on
to
the
good
part
nose
is
a
blast
of
pine
that
seems
to
mingle
very
well
with
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
some
sweet
caramelbrown
sugar
notes
some
citrus
folded
in
as
well
very
nice
actually
had
the
first
one
from
the
bottle
at
thanksgiving
dinner
and
the
aromas
were
coming
out
of
the
neck
something
fierce
smuggled
two
home
and
tried
again
with
a
glass
taste
exudes
really
good
balance
and
pulls
off
exactly
what
they
were
going
for
a
piney
snow
coating
over
dark
malty
flavors
to
create
a
new
landscape
nicely
intertwined
citrusy
fruit
peeking
out
here
and
there
as
well
medium
body
with
a
slick
and
almost
wet
if
that
makes
sense
feel
no
bad
aftertastes
barely
any
heat
and
pretty
well
defined
not
muddy
not
a
hops
smack
but
a
wellbalanced
and
well
done
easy
drinking
brew
chocoroastypinefruit
sends
an
impressive
message
from
otter
creek
more
good
things
in
store
final
thoughts
probably
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
so
far
its
a
simple
black
ipa
but
its
done
totally
right
worth
a
buy
for
sure
i
only
got
a
single
in
a
pickasix
but
i
could
get
a
full
sixer
and
not
be
bored
with
this
one
very
well
put
together
very
nicely
done
will
surely
keep
an
eye
out
for
otter
creek
in
the
future
o
i
nice
little
black
ale
here
nothing
out
of
this
world
though
i
am
yet
to
have
a
beer
in
this
style
that
is
but
gets
the
job
done
even
though
a
black
ipa
is
an
oxymoron
i
still
like
this
beer
its
very
well
balanced
with
a
number
a
flavor
profiles
that
complement
each
other
it
contains
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
be
considered
an
ipa
but
not
too
many
which
would
take
away
from
the
roasted
malt
profile
ive
seen
a
number
of
reviewers
saying
the
roasted
malt
in
this
beer
left
a
burnt
taste
in
there
mouth
this
didnt
occur
to
me
maybe
they
changed
their
recipe
recently
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
someone
who
is
craving
a
roasted
malt
beer
and
ipa
at
the
same
time
overall
i
must
admit
to
being
pleasantly
surprised
i
thought
the
label
art
to
be
rather
cheesy
and
inferred
that
the
brewing
process
was
similary
shortcutted
instead
i
find
this
to
be
an
aromatic
tasty
beer
which
i
would
definitley
have
again
still
thought
theyve
got
to
change
this
label
it
looks
like
it
was
created
with
online
clip
art
overall
my
favorite
beer
if
you
drank
this
blind
folded
you
wouldnt
know
it
was
a
black
beer
this
beer
is
the
perfect
example
of
how
people
generally
move
from
lighter
to
darker
beers
as
their
palette
becomes
knowledgeable
to
be
honest
this
is
my
first
and
only
beer
of
this
style
american
black
ale
and
there
may
be
others
out
there
by
different
breweries
that
i
would
actually
like
more
d
the
flavor
starts
out
good
but
finishes
somewhere
i
dont
want
to
go
it
just
has
a
charred
flavor
ooverall
its
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
will
come
back
for
one
of
my
first
few
black
ipas
that
i
have
tried
so
im
not
as
up
on
the
style
as
i
am
with
others
good
mouthfeel
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
touchy
of
creaminesstongue
coating
oils
very
drinkable
lingering
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
not
overly
long
if
you
enjoy
this
style
this
is
certainly
one
to
try
o
overall
a
nice
black
ipa
i
liked
the
nose
a
lot
though
i
thought
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
one
dimensional
being
very
roasted
would
give
it
another
shot
overall
we
say
get
it
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
will
go
well
with
a
cheese
swiss
blu
or
sharp
oh
try
it
with
a
good
hotdog
really
its
only
the
second
black
ipa
ive
tried
and
for
the
second
time
im
not
overly
impressed
a
fine
beer
i
suppose
but
i
dont
think
its
particularly
brilliant
it
kicks
around
some
hops
here
and
there
and
is
a
little
more
strong
on
the
roasted
malts
this
is
also
my
first
time
with
otter
creek
i
think
i
got
it
pretty
cheap
at
trader
joes
so
not
the
massive
investment
that
comes
occasionally
with
some
others
in
general
id
say
it
more
or
less
met
my
expectations
but
id
have
been
a
little
happier
with
something
a
little
stronger
and
a
little
bolder
its
now
advertised
as
year
round
ill
probably
look
elsewhere
though
for
some
variety
o
very
drinkable
reminds
me
of
a
sam
adams
in
a
way
that
things
are
nicely
balanced
solid
flavor
and
makes
for
a
very
smooth
drinking
experience
while
others
strive
for
brute
force
this
finds
a
good
niche
among
the
crowd
who
enjoy
balance
and
smooth
drinkability
a
few
of
these
can
definitely
go
down
no
problem
at
all
o
a
good
black
ipa
that
begins
to
lean
towards
hoppy
porter
but
stays
well
shy
well
done
oall
a
big
flavorful
beer
but
too
roasty
and
without
a
big
bright
hop
presence
as
would
like
to
see
in
the
style
fans
of
big
porters
likely
would
like
this
one
as
well
od
really
solid
offering
a
beer
much
better
on
tap
a
style
im
really
starting
to
enjoy
and
you
should
start
here
cheers
a
nice
smooth
medium
bodied
beer
nice
carb
level
and
just
a
great
tasting
easydrinking
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
an
enjoyable
version
this
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
beers
ive
ever
seen
it
pours
a
nearly
impenetrable
black
with
a
big
brown
head
that
is
at
first
billowing
and
frumpy
and
then
settles
into
a
thumbthick
layer
with
outstanding
retention
aromas
are
delightfully
hopping
with
lots
of
citrusy
and
evergreen
needle
notes
with
a
good
amount
of
charred
character
good
flavors
that
consistent
with
the
those
but
more
complex
due
to
a
sweeter
toffee
taste
on
the
midpalate
lingering
notes
of
coffee
and
orange
zest
a
very
tasty
beer
almost
as
good
as
black
ipas
that
cost
3
or
4
times
as
much
making
this
an
excellent
value
overall
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
quite
interesting
to
say
the
least
its
kinda
funky
and
kinda
sweet
at
the
same
time
just
like
a
hippie
from
oregon
overall
not
bad
and
probably
decent
for
the
style
not
overwhelmingly
amazing
although
enjoyable
enough
if
you
like
this
style
to
be
truthful
i
did
not
enjoy
this
brew
the
first
two
times
i
had
it
this
third
time
though
i
really
appreciated
the
equally
considered
malt
and
hop
characters
came
in
a
summer
sampler
12
pack
poured
dark
with
a
good
about
of
head
the
color
was
near
pitch
black
and
the
head
was
a
brownish
color
as
a
black
ipa
the
ipa
taste
came
first
hoppy
but
a
stoutcoffeetype
taste
came
after
and
lingered
much
longer
never
seen
this
style
before
so
was
curious
but
a
very
good
choice
and
glad
that
i
got
it
while
this
is
not
particularly
exciting
its
not
bad
its
definitely
worth
a
try
very
drinkable
and
its
kind
of
sad
that
it
is
only
available
in
the
winter
the
appeal
of
a
good
porter
with
a
over
hopped
fruit
to
it
there
is
some
back
note
of
chocolate
and
coffee
that
are
blended
with
the
front
of
mouth
hop
dryness
not
tannin
sticky
sort
of
has
a
quick
finish
with
some
porter
notes
that
fade
faster
than
a
porter
a
hint
of
grass
a
hint
of
chocolate
it
was
better
fresh
on
draft
when
i
had
it
a
few
months
ago
now
just
kinda
meh
this
is
a
stout
beer
with
some
extra
hop
kick
this
is
not
an
ipa
lets
stick
to
stouts
being
stout
and
ipas
being
ipas
please
dont
try
to
mix
each
is
terrific
in
its
own
right
but
they
arent
made
to
be
married
the
flavor
just
isnt
doing
it
for
me
this
is
a
tasty
brew
from
otter
creek
one
of
the
better
offerings
that
ive
had
from
them
in
recent
memory
overall
i
really
like
this
brew
the
roasted
malts
and
the
strong
amount
of
hops
play
well
together
this
is
not
for
every
palate
but
give
it
a
shot
if
you
like
the
above
qualities
overall
tasty
brew
i
am
really
becoming
a
fan
american
black
ales
black
ipas
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
it
doesnt
appear
many
bas
seem
to
favor
this
style
i
love
porters
stouts
and
ipas
and
whats
better
than
a
beer
that
represents
all
those
styles
i
get
a
very
nice
balance
of
those
styles
in
this
brew
i
have
had
better
of
course
but
certainly
worth
checking
out
this
black
ipa
d
i
thought
it
was
very
good
overall
i
would
drink
this
again
and
again
d
pretty
good
other
than
a
few
flaws
nothing
that
would
prevent
me
from
having
another
though
i
like
this
emerging
style
we
have
here
a
very
good
black
ipa
and
not
to
intense
or
high
in
abv
to
where
you
couldnt
have
a
few
i
wonder
why
these
black
beers
have
such
a
propensity
to
created
such
a
big
dense
head
here
it
was
two
rocky
fingers
of
deepmocha
head
with
enviable
retention
color
was
talk
about
truth
in
advertising
jet
black
there
was
no
light
penetration
whatsoever
thats
ok
since
some
of
my
friendliest
beers
are
black
they
can
come
over
to
my
house
any
time
in
fact
some
of
them
are
really
liked
by
my
sister
shes
into
black
nose
was
initially
bursting
with
piney
hops
but
a
second
whiff
gave
me
smoke
and
dark
chocolate
this
is
what
bothers
me
about
the
style
it
is
like
the
old
reeses
commercial
hey
you
got
your
chocolate
in
my
peanut
butter
no
man
you
got
my
peanut
butter
on
your
chocolate
with
the
tag
line
being
two
great
tastes
that
taste
great
together
yeah
well
keep
your
roasted
malts
out
of
my
american
ipas
dang
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
there
was
a
fistfight
on
my
tongue
smoke
then
bitter
then
chocolate
then
more
bitter
until
the
melange
tasted
like
a
hangover
morning
this
is
not
my
bag
baby
what
happened
some
genius
got
bored
and
thought
that
this
would
be
a
good
idea
epic
fail
the
finish
left
me
gasping
for
breath
and
not
in
a
good
way
it
tasted
like
the
fire
in
the
hops
plant
that
caused
the
dry
spell
a
few
years
back
jeezo
man
color
me
not
a
fan
pours
blackhole
black
and
hazy
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
recedes
to
just
a
thin
layer
big
pine
hop
scent
up
front
with
roasty
malts
in
the
background
taste
of
bitter
piney
hops
up
front
if
you
werent
expecting
such
a
dark
ale
to
be
hoppy
you
will
be
surprised
mild
essence
of
citrus
zest
just
noticeable
pine
resin
grass
and
a
good
malt
roastiness
to
follow
but
with
the
hops
everpresent
throughout
rich
and
flavorful
medium
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
mainly
if
you
like
your
hops
which
i
do
mouthfeel
is
very
good
obviously
full
bodied
smooth
beer
with
a
great
carbonation
level
it
has
a
strong
earthy
finish
from
the
hops
at
the
end
very
drinkable
easy
going
down
very
good
for
the
style
and
a
great
new
addition
to
the
otter
creek
lineup
in
my
opinion
o
dont
know
what
i
was
expecting
with
this
but
i
was
thoroughly
impressed
nice
big
citrusy
black
ipa
will
definitely
seek
this
out
in
the
future
this
is
a
well
done
black
ipa
and
definitely
one
of
the
most
reasonably
priced
glad
to
see
this
is
year
round
as
its
definitely
something
i
could
see
myself
buying
again
good
stuff
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
oily
slick
with
light
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
a
light
and
almost
watery
feel
highly
drinkable
this
was
very
good
and
a
very
tasty
beer
very
dark
brown
nearly
aque
with
just
a
hint
of
lit
making
it
through
the
beer
fine
dark
tan
bubbles
coated
the
top
of
the
beer
leaving
solid
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
glass
good
head
retention
nice
aroma
caramel
and
chocolate
underneath
grapefruit
and
citrus
pith
solid
bitterness
nicely
balanced
with
the
malt
sweetness
and
citrusy
hop
character
caramel
chocolate
creamy
texture
medium
bodied
slightly
dry
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
finish
a
good
take
on
the
style
well
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
solid
offering
pretty
straight
forward
and
approachable
for
the
odd
style
perhaps
a
little
too
smooth
a
mouthfeel
i
think
it
could
be
a
little
more
prickly
great
beer
only
the
second
of
two
bipas
that
ive
tried
and
this
was
pretty
dern
good
a
touch
shy
of
ink
black
with
a
foamy
cola
colored
cap
that
rose
two
fingers
before
falling
slowly
a
soft
aroma
of
roast
pokes
through
first
before
spruce
tips
and
mint
take
over
not
an
overwhelming
aroma
but
soft
and
pleasing
the
flavor
profile
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
a
light
roast
that
has
a
touch
of
char
to
it
with
some
cocoa
powder
leads
off
with
a
minty
spruce
herbal
hop
profile
taking
over
down
the
homestretch
the
finish
is
minty
with
a
touch
of
lingering
char
overall
i
found
this
to
do
everything
pretty
good
but
nothing
great
a
solid
example
of
the
style
that
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
a
very
nice
balanced
black
ale
not
a
homerun
but
that
may
be
due
to
age
hops
were
a
little
subdued
for
my
liking
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
some
hints
of
amber
thick
tan
head
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
some
streaks
of
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
roasted
coffee
with
citrus
hops
and
roasted
malt
nice
bitter
flavour
lots
of
sweetness
as
well
some
chocolate
in
the
aftertaste
i
think
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
quite
a
nice
black
ipa
do
drinkability
is
moderately
high
for
my
first
beer
in
the
style
i
have
to
say
it
came
off
a
bit
better
than
i
was
expecting
smelling
a
dark
beer
and
getting
crisp
hops
is
definitely
a
strange
feeling
but
i
just
see
it
as
taking
the
hoppy
stout
to
the
next
level
i
will
definitely
be
seeking
out
some
other
black
ipas
now
big
close
to
three
finger
head
rich
mix
of
varied
bubble
sizes
even
dissolve
without
much
dimpling
dark
tan
in
color
lacing
more
along
the
lines
of
broad
splotches
than
streaks
very
good
stick
barely
moves
long
after
the
head
settles
liquid
color
certainly
lives
up
to
its
billing
black
and
opaque
even
if
not
dense
in
appearance
thin
orange
rust
influence
at
the
glass
bottom
the
nose
is
a
pleasing
mélange
of
malts
and
hops
with
cocoa
powder
mocha
ginger
snaps
walnuts
and
then
tangerine
zest
green
hay
and
grass
wildflowers
and
a
glance
of
apricot
red
apple
cherry
fruit
scents
good
stiffness
and
length
mediumbodied
too
tightly
woven
to
be
heavier
plus
the
carbonation
has
a
steady
lifting
quality
which
prevents
too
much
soaking
in
more
overt
roast
here
at
once
plays
up
its
overall
bitterness
while
emphasizing
mocha
cocoa
molasses
dark
chocolate
that
tangerine
to
white
grapefruit
element
keeps
the
energy
high
while
adding
a
bit
of
needed
sweetness
pepper
and
clove
spice
keep
it
lively
the
herbaceousness
stays
in
check
not
as
floral
here
however
the
apricot
peach
apple
fruit
a
tick
higher
dry
finish
with
good
grip
and
palate
coverage
excellent
example
of
a
category
growing
in
popularity
this
fine
brew
pours
a
solid
black
with
big
frothy
head
this
looks
very
delicious
and
tempting
has
the
look
of
a
big
time
stout
the
distinct
smell
of
fresh
bittering
hops
blasts
through
the
nose
and
teases
the
brain
with
delight
very
sweet
and
mild
malts
mixed
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
taste
big
citrus
hops
with
a
big
toasted
malty
over
tone
that
ends
with
a
nutty
andor
chocolate
finish
lite
to
medium
mouth
feel
watery
a
tad
bitter
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
black
ipa
a
nice
mix
of
almost
a
porterstout
and
a
ipa
a
fine
blend
i
do
not
work
for
otter
creek
or
its
affiliates
perfect
example
dont
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
tastes
nothing
like
it
looks
this
style
is
fast
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
and
this
is
a
solid
example
low
on
the
alcohol
but
rich
in
the
flavor
dare
i
say
almost
sessionable
md
creamyish
and
very
smooth
light
bodied
and
strong
carbonation
not
exactly
what
youd
expect
but
its
decent
id
order
it
again
not
a
style
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
but
something
i
think
id
like
with
a
bigger
hop
bite
overall
a
good
solid
beer
very
drinkable
with
a
big
flavor
a
bit
high
octane
for
a
session
beer
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
this
is
a
really
good
everyday
type
of
beer
pours
a
nice
one
finger
head
the
colors
are
very
interesting
because
the
body
is
not
black
like
the
bottle
indicated
it
would
be
its
like
a
dark
dark
dark
brown
its
very
close
to
being
black
but
it
is
brown
i
say
the
color
is
weird
because
the
head
is
pretty
dark
i
usually
only
notice
dark
heads
in
pitch
black
beers
oh
well
the
head
has
faded
a
little
bit
now
it
looks
like
its
leaving
good
lacing
though
it
looks
like
a
very
yummy
beer
i
would
like
a
bigger
head
but
whatever
man
i
love
black
ipas
this
beer
smells
like
it
has
just
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
malts
as
perfect
as
you
can
get
they
smell
just
so
well
blended
together
no
aroma
dominates
on
some
sniffs
you
get
that
chocolate
malt
smell
and
on
other
sniffs
you
get
that
crisp
hop
smell
im
excited
to
taste
this
because
it
smells
so
good
but
then
again
most
black
ipas
smell
good
the
only
thing
not
great
about
the
smell
is
that
its
not
too
complex
but
who
cares
it
smells
great
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
a
nice
big
mouthfeel
on
this
i
love
it
when
my
beers
have
a
big
body
and
mouthfeel
on
them
is
it
the
biggest
mouthfeel
ever
no
but
its
an
ipa
so
a
good
mouthfeel
however
big
it
is
is
impressive
i
then
notice
the
taste
which
is
just
like
the
smell
perfectly
blended
hops
and
malts
really
really
tasty
i
mean
its
very
simple
but
its
just
really
well
done
i
cant
give
it
style
points
but
i
can
give
it
plenty
of
brew
points
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
at
all
if
it
were
a
little
more
complex
i
would
consider
giving
it
a
few
5s
as
it
is
though
great
beer
great
flavor
super
well
done
the
beer
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
was
of
sharp
floral
hops
while
simple
it
was
very
enticing
the
taste
is
of
lightly
toasted
malt
with
a
nice
floral
hop
overtone
the
feel
is
medium
and
wet
this
was
a
most
pleasant
beer
and
one
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
really
good
beer
iam
5050
on
american
black
alessome
i
have
really
likedsome
didnt
work
very
well
for
methis
was
great
poured
into
a
stansard
pint
glass
a
deep
cola
color
with
a
thinner
but
retentive
beige
colored
head
aromas
of
black
malt
and
a
big
grapefruit
rind
shotnot
much
sweetness
was
detected
a
real
nice
mix
of
in
your
face
citric
hops
and
unsweetened
bitter
chocolatei
was
surprised
at
how
well
the
dry
chocolate
held
up
to
the
hopsthe
malt
profile
is
quite
dry
with
the
big
hops
and
sweetness
in
check
this
a
very
drinkable
and
very
well
made
beeri
really
liked
this
one
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
tan
mocha
colored
head
that
did
last
along
the
edges
the
aroma
is
a
muted
american
hop
bouquet
it
seems
like
the
roasted
malts
keep
the
aroma
down
a
tad
the
longer
the
beer
sits
the
more
the
roasted
malt
comes
through
the
inital
taste
is
the
american
hops
slightly
piney
some
grapefruit
the
finish
turns
to
the
roasty
malt
and
chewy
sweetness
much
like
a
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
too
much
carbonation
and
too
much
alcohol
warmth
i
love
the
idea
of
this
style
but
i
havent
had
one
yet
that
i
thought
really
brought
everything
together
with
the
ipa
hoppiness
and
roastly
malt
finish
i
think
this
would
be
improved
with
english
hops
and
a
less
attenuating
yeast
overall
an
awesome
black
ipa
i
personally
like
regular
and
double
ipas
but
this
black
one
is
pretty
good
overall
a
very
solid
beer
great
for
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
edit
i
was
a
bit
too
harsh
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ipa
and
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
recently
lots
of
resin
and
oily
hop
characters
to
add
to
the
mocha
chicory
and
and
almost
licorice
taste
from
the
malts
just
a
very
nice
and
complex
beer
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
overall
very
good
and
not
overly
bitter
american
black
ale
i
could
have
several
of
these
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
in
the
style
i
have
found
so
far
i
like
the
pine
flavors
cheers
d
moderately
high
id
blow
through
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
worth
trying
at
least
would
think
that
this
could
use
an
increase
in
the
malt
bill
to
beef
it
up
a
bit
flavorwise
but
its
pretty
drinkable
asis
just
doesnt
do
much
to
stand
out
from
the
crowd
d
this
is
a
nice
black
ale
and
im
happy
to
see
one
in
a
12
oz
bottle
if
you
want
to
get
the
real
feel
for
this
beer
let
it
warm
up
if
not
drink
it
cold
and
get
the
full
hop
effect
the
cpj
cask
at
rattle
n
hum
second
day
medium
mouthfeel
hoppy
dark
cascadian
hop
also
apollo
and
other
hops
unfiltered
good
drinkability
though
a
tad
of
stringency
a
little
chocolate
and
roast
dark
coloured
body
another
good
one
recently
from
otter
creek
the
taste
is
similarly
front
loaded
with
hop
flavors
but
the
malt
kicks
in
later
roasted
and
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
versus
citrus
and
pine
oil
id
like
to
say
its
well
balanced
but
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
the
flavors
are
fighting
each
other
instead
of
cooperating
mouthfeel
is
adequately
stiff
and
a
touch
overcarbonated
smooth
in
texture
as
expected
not
my
speed
i
guess
but
you
could
certainly
do
much
worse
d
pretty
good
but
for
some
reason
i
just
dont
want
to
drink
too
much
of
this
maybe
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
a
bit
schizophrenic
but
tasty
nonetheless
not
just
a
you
got
chocolate
in
my
peanut
butter
but
actually
like
alternating
different
beers
good
stuff

that

it
definitely
improved

i
got
further
down

was

the

if

like

quite
bitter
beers

this

pleasing

a
fan
of
the
charred

mingling
with
the

lame
what
do
i
need
this
for
beer
love
founders
but
this
beer
belongs
in
the
toilet
flavor
is
almost
zero
no
one
is
perfect
my
second
favorite
black

that
taste
is
that
of
dark
belgian
chocolate
nicaraguan
tobacco
sweet
cherries
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
highly
hoppy
to
begin
with
a
sweeter
aftertaste
the
hops
dont
smell
as
strong
its
a
beer
for
the
ipa
crowd
the
less
ipa
centered
crowd
wont
appreciate
this

much
its
more
a
sipping

be
enjoyed

this
was
a
good
ipa
overall
i
was
a
big
fan
of
the
color
and
the
mouthfeel
the
taste
however
which
is
the
most
important
aspect
was
only
okay
this
beer
is
a
monster
did
you
read
the
official
style
imperial
black
india
pale
ale
this
one
has
a
huge
presence
without
being
overdone
in
any
sense
its
probably
the
most
wellbalanced
bipa
ive
ever
had
ive
yet
to
try
a
founders
beer
i
didnt
like
but
this
one
might
be
my
new
favorite
well
second
only
to
fbs
of
course
o
very
good
more
complexity
than
most
black
ipas
and
it
has
a
nice
malty
character
overall
very
good
for
the
style
i
prefer
a
sweeter
beer
like
black
perle
the
bitter
hops
dominate
in
this
beer
on
the
palette
extremely
rich
and
complex
initially
sweet
chocolate
gives
way
to
burnt
coffee
bean
dark
bitter
chocolate
black
licorice
hints
of
smoke
with
lots
of
pineysoapyresiny
hops
the
finish
is
long
lasting
i
love
founders
another
great
beer
its
very
good
i
really
love
it
12oz
bottle
overall
my
first
american
black
ale
i
enjoyed
it
just
too
much
hops
and
bitterness
for
me
taste
seems
tamer
up
front
with
a
more
subtle
blend
of
malty
and
hoppy
the
finish
is
out
of
this
world
lasts
forever
with
the
dry
hoppy
bitter
and
light
malty
blooming
and
blooming
serving
type
bottle
first
i
was
relieved
it
was
not
a
rye
ipa
dont
shoot
but
rye
isnt
my
thing
ive
had
it
bottled
and
draft
and
both
left
a
gorgeous
lace
the
aroma
isnt
anythjng
to
write
home
about
and
the
feel
is
a
little
lighter
than
what
it
looks
like
but
for
a
black
ipa
its
on
point
i
really
enjoyed
the
flavor
and
the
bitter
ending
to
each
sip
its
my
latest
crush
and
i
am
excited
to
drink
it
while
this
winter
apocalypse
continues
i
really
dont
enjoy
imperial
blacks
or
pale
ales
and
yet
this
beer
is
very
very
good
the
look
is
muddy
but
it
smells
great
great
surprisingly
smooth
and
not
as
bitter
as
a
lot
of
pales
from
a
hophead
pov
i
am
caught
in
between
saying
nice
dark
ipa
or
noting
a
clash
of
malt
vs
hop
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
high
abv
will
be
noticeable
by
the
less
experienced
i
think
the
sweeter
malt
taste
was
more
present
but
understand
those
noting
the
hop
bitterness
for
all
that
is
going
on
i
thought
it
was
fairly
drinkable
founders
has
the
right
idea
here
just
needs
a
little
more
tweaking
not
many
of
this
style
are
better
though
good
flavors
yet
still
crispy
clean
in
some
aspects
worth
a
try
or
a
couple
ill
bet
this
steps
ip
a
notch
on
draft
the
head
is
about
a
half
finger
but
it
looks
super
dense
and
mainly
midsized
bubbles
which
lends
visual
texture
without
sacrificing
retention
the
lacing
is
a
bit
wispy
but
spreads
over
a
wide
area
of
the
available
glass
sides
the
liquid
is
not
quite
opaque
and
up
close
you
really
see
how
clear
it
is
basic
brown
color
no
bubbles
to
be
seen
except
a
few
here
and
there
near
the
surface
actually
looks
like
a
tweener
in
the
nose
the
roast
comes
through
like
a
bell
coffee
and
mocha
behind
that
is
caramel
butterscotch
and
coconut
at
turns
gets
close
to
being
peaty
mild
apricot
and
cherry
fruit
scents
with
all
of
that
maltiness
the
burst
of
herbaceousness
is
a
jolting
reminder
that
technically
it
is
an
ipa
mediumbodied
lacking
in
the
carbonation
department
which
saps
some
of
the
life
which
would
truly
make
this
a
superlative
beer
dark
chocolate
coffee
beans
toasted
coconut
shake
hands
with
pine
sap
leafy
matter
and
white
grapefruit
zest
while
bitter
you
easily
adjust
to
it
nothing
about
this
is
shy
nor
retiring
it
is
not
an
easy
sipper
for
as
much
zigging
and
zagging
as
you
get
it
still
manages
to
hold
it
together
vibrant
good
naturedly
argumentative
for
me
one
of
the
definitive
beers
of
this
style
poured
almost
a
thick
pitch
black
and
the
smell
was
dominated
by
malt
and
alcohol
almost
no
hop
presence
tasted
very
similar
to
the
smell
with
some
added
sweetness
overall
too
sweet
boozy
thick
and
malty
to
be
associated

initial

all
said
really
enjoying
it
sitting
in

of
the
fireplace
on
a
cold
february
afternoon
just
because
you
are
supposed
to
like
something
doesnt
mean
you
should
on
tap
at
wob
easton
im
enjoying
this
beer
quite
a
bit
but
more
as
a
novelty
of
what
beer
can
be
than
as
something
i
find
genuinely
delicious
i
imagine
itd
pair
very
well
with
syrupysweet
barbecue
or
bulgolgi
and
just
might
make
a
second
review
for
that
pairing
a
bit
too
bitter
for
me
cant
say
im
a
fan
of
the
style
o
the
booziness
is
a
bit
annoying
but
as
far
as
black
ipas
go
this
is
a
fairly
balanced
and
tasty
one
its
not
particularly
special
though
i
would
really
rather
have
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
over
this
one
the
flavor
is
darker
than
the
smellmore
burnt
elements
the
hop
bitterness
is
also
strongervery
much
a
black
ipa
a
bit
harsh
the
aftertaste
goes
on
seemingly
forever
full
bodied
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
this
is
a
rich
beer
the
flavor
is
equally
complexslightly
sweet
but
more
bitter
chewy
overall
i
could
smell
the
beer
all
day
but
the
balance
i
picked
up
in
the
aroma
is
not
what
arrives
on
the
palate
sadly
the
clash
of
the
flavors
on
my
palate
really
limited
my
enjoyment
of
this
beer
often
a
problem
with
the
american
black
style
wanted
just
a
bit
more
this
is
a
great
utterly
dark
nearly
black
beer
the
head
is
a
creamy

the
smell
is

with
some
chocolate
and
dark

notes

hops
as
well
intense
flavor
lots
of
sweetness
malt
and
highly
roasted
flavors
combined
with
a
serious
hop
bitterness
hefty
body
and
very
satisfying
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
a
black
ale
for
my
taste
o
overall
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
with
a
great
deal
of
samples
being
homogeneously
the
same
this
one
for
sure
stands
out
with
a
bold
roasted
character
and
a
hop
bitterness
that
sets
it
apart
whoa
way
over
on
the
hoppy
end
of
the
black
ipa
scale
ibus
are
big
and
the
aroma
is
lean
old
school
citrusandpine
chinook
and
centennial
as
it
turns
out
a
hit
of
roasty
sweetness
in
the
form
of
burnt
sugar
is
about
the
only
nod
to
blackness
that
keeps
it
from
getting
sticky
and
its
somehow
not
hot
which
adds
up
to
it
being
super
drinkable
overall
colossal

this
is
truly
a

brew
and
a
well
made
one
my
sample
was
bottled
in
october
and
drank
in

and
it
was
fine
it
had
a
major
edge
to
it
still

definitely
a

brew

flavors

a

with
a

going
for
it
i
wish
it
had
a
little
more
character
on
the
bitterness
that
would
make
it
even
better
nice
stout
mildly
thick
with
decent
flavor
and
nice
aroma
got
this
as
a
gift
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
really
liked
it
and
would
try
again
very
easy
to
drink
not
boozy
and
enjoyed
the
roasty
aspects
of
it
well
done
and
not
over
the
top
a
very
fine
dark
ipa
pours
an
opaque
black
almost
seems
to
absorb
the

around
it
aroma

and

overall
i
like
the
balance

and
dark

a
very
good
double
version
of
my
favorite
ipa
style
picked
a
single
12
oz
bottle
out
of
a
line
up
togo
at
cafe
craft
in
north
charleston
sc
carefully
poured
at
home
in
to
a
ipa
glass
giving
ample
time
to
let
the
experience
unfold
the
beer
is
a
translucent
chestnut
brown
during
the
pour
but
black
and
foreboding
when
it
collects
in
the
glass
completely
opaque
slow
rising
carbonation
yields
a
single
finger
of
beige
foam
in
time
the
foam
dissolves
leaving
some
oily
hop
residue
on
the
surface
no
lacing
a
burnt
caramel
aroma
mingles
with
some
minty
pine
hops
underscored
by
freshly
baked
dark
breads
altogether
it
yields
a
feigned
impression
of
rye
with
some
nice
floral
hops
a
complex
and
inviting
nose
the
initial
sip
is
dominated
by
tart
citrus
bitterness
with
thin
cocoa
in
the
background
theres
faint
smoke
with
an
earthy
herbal
flavor
throughout
the
finish
is
relatively
dry
the
aftertaste
is
where
this
beer
shines
with
a
dark
chocolate
citrus
flavor
reminiscent
of
an
orange
truffle
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
with
soft
prickly
carbonation
quite
nice
the
alcohol
in
this
beer
is
incredibly
well
hidden
in
fact
it
wasnt
until
i
sensed
a
small
buzz
that
i
checked
the
label
i
was
shocked
to
see
8

abv
of
course
that
is
not
unreasonable
in
the
world
of
double
ipas
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
this
one
was
in
that
league
thats
a
testament
to
the
quality
of
this
brew
i
would
have
preferred
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
balance
but
theres
little
to
complain
about
here
what
youll
find
is
a
fine
example
of
assertive
hops
with
a
little
chocolate
roast
to
add
complexity
another
solid
founders
creation
would
you
expect
anything
less
the
rare
black
ipa
that
comes
off
more
as
a
stout
ipa
blend
than
simply
a
dark
but
wimpy
ipa
the
smell
wasnt
pleasent
but
you
get
used
to
it
very
drinkable
for
the
style
overall
nothing
special
but
a
solid
black
ipa
too
much
pine
for
me
and
i
wish
the
black
portion
of
this
was
emphasized
more
especially
with
chocolate
probably
wouldnt
bother
trying
to
pick
this
up
again
i
prefer
new
glarus
blacktop
southern
tier
iniquity
and
lake
louie
radio
free
iba
a
world
class
black
ipa
from
founders
dark
as
night
with
a
ruby
red
undertone
on
the
color
roasted
notes
and
vibrant
grassy
hops
on
the
nose
this
somehow
melds
a
dark
roasty
malt
backend
with
an
aggressive
hop
profile
yet
remains
balanced
the
alcohol
content
is
high
this
is
a
sipper
that
opens
up
new
notes
when
it
warms
lots
of
complexity
here
with
a
slight
anise
and
licorice
feel
that
comes
in
near
the
end
pleasantly
bitter
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
was
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
blind
pig
mug
and
enjoyed
at
apx
55f
as
it
warms
it
takes
on
some
less
favorable
hop
flavors
with
lowers
its
enjoyment
value
for
someone
who
isnt
a
fan
of
the
style
ive
found
a
black
ipa
in
my
fridge
more
often
than
ive
thought
this
one
has
been
the
best
of
the
bunch
solid
but
very
bitter
little
sweet
on
the
first
sip
cant
quite
figure
out
what
hops
the
notes
are
slightly
piny
tho
good
but
not
great
pours
a
black
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
sight
roasted
malt
hops
pine
and
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
an
american
black
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
are
also
noticeable
levels
of
dryness
and
bitterness
tastes
of
slight
roasted
malt
hops
sweet
malt
slight
pine
and
alcohol
overall
weak
appearance
strong
aroma
and
body
and
a
good
blend
o
honestly
not
my
favorite
beer
of
the
style
there
are
nice
flavors
in
here
however
theyre
not
harmonized
in
the
best
of
ways
and
i
would
like
a
little
bit
more
citrusysweetness
in
here
also
a
bit
of
harshness
in
here
but
not
so
much
offputting
that
i
would
say
its
awful
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
though
o
good
brew
from
founders
and
the
100ibus
kick
it
overall
this
pairing
of
conventional
ipa
bitterness
with
darker
malt
offers
little
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
a
fair
foray
on
the
part
of
founders
but
it
falls
short
of
their
finer
offerings
though
i
give
them
props
for
the
sweet
label
art
this
is
a
big
beer
done
well
lots
of
bold
flavors
that
meld
together
nicely
i
think
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
black
ipa
is
simply
not
my
style
while
i
dont
find
any
true
flaws
and
theres
nothing
bad
or
offensive
about
it
i
just
dont
think
ill
spend
the
money
on
this
one
again
looks
like
a
stout
tastes
like
an
ipa
with
a
burnt
malt
flavor
on
the
tail
end
not
very
drinkable
overall
give
me
a
centennial
ipa
and
ill
be
happy
d
this
was
an
ok
black
ipa
with
scent
mostly
just
like
an
ipa
the
taste
wasnt
as
good
although
the
finish
was
smooth
enough
the
body
was
nice
and
the
alcohol
was
fairly
well
hidden
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
average
brew
for
the
style
but
i
expect
better
from
founders
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
was
expecting
more
from
them
bottled
on
9102014
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
i
have
to
say
this
is
much
better
with
about
3
months
on
it
the
first
time
i
had
it
fresh
it
was
just
bitter
and
did
not
have
allot
of
character
now
that
it
hung
around
in
the
fridge
for
a
few
months
it
has
developed
nice
citrus
fruit
notes
that
were
masked
in
bitterness
when
fresh
a
smooth
ipa
for
someone
who
does
not
usually
like
ipas
o
this
is
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
expected
an
imperial
black
ipa
to
be
the
nice
part
about
it
is
that
the
added
malt
heft
sweetens
things
a
bit
and
tempers
that
expected
double
dose
of
bitterness
if
you
like
the
style
you
will
want
to
try
this
overall
i
know
this
is
a
pretty
rough
style
of
beer
for
most
palates
but
i
really
enjoy
it
as
it
combines
my
favorite
two
styles
definitely
recommend
if
you
want
a
rough
and
tumble
roasty
hoppy
brew
that
is
blended
very
nicely
its
a
founders
ipa
gone
dark
follows
their
pattern
of
deeply
roasted
malts
and
hits
a
particular
hop
profile
its
good
but
not
strong
for
their
lineup
not
what
id
expected
from
founders
very
bitter
and
lacking
of
complexity
maybe
my
bottle
was
past
its
prime
bottled

founders
makes
some
fantastic
brews
this
isnt
one
of
them
the
beer
isnt
hot
but
it
does
have
a
solvent
quality
that
makes
it
less
enjoyable
pours
nearly

ending
is
good

hoppy
but
very
palatable
overall
a
very
good
tasty
brew
i
usually
write
a
more
indepth
overall
summary
but
lets
just
say
that
beers
like
this
are
the
reason
why
founders
continues
to
take
so
much
of
my
money
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
very
bright
moderate
in
both
crispness
and
smoothness
but
very
consistent
from
front
to
finish
great
black
ipa
smooth
finish
o
another
fantastic
beer
from
founders
they
never
seem
to
let
us
down
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
lots
of
great
ipa
notes
on
this
one
i
really
liked
this
bought
it
right
away
super
fresh
just
rating
way
later
founders
has
some
great
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
isnt
anything
particularly
different
from
what
ive
had
before
and
certainly
not
befitting
a
new
style
designation
its
just
a
hoppy
imperial
stout
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
then
give
it
a
try
but
its
a
bit
of
a
stretch
calling
it
an
imperial
black
india
pale
ale
overall
i
havent
had
many
imperial
black
ales
but
this
one
is
excellent
and
memorable
delicious
deep
complex
bold
and
balanced
nicely
and
a
perfect
transition
that
begs
the
next
sip
a
must
try
in
my
opinion
and
quite
possibly
sets
the
bar
for
the
style
another
great
founders
offering
overall
fantastic
beer
once
again
by
founders
pretty
damn
strong
on
the
malt
and
hop
lovely
dangerous
stuff
possible
food
pairings
very
very
strong
cheddar
very
fatty
pork
dishes
bath
chaps
christmas
cake
carolinakc
bbq
gamey
red
meat
o
not
my
favorite
style
though
one
i
still
drink
pretty
frequently
but
from
a
brewery
i
really
respect
so
i
felt
obligated
to
try
this
one
and
im
glad
that
i
did
because
i
really
enjoyed
it
sometimes
the
combination
of
roasted
malts
and
hop
profiles
do
not
match
on
my
palate
easy
to
drink
overall
i
am
very
glad
that
i
had
not
decided
to
write
this
review
until
the
fourth
time
that
i
had
tried
this
beer
at
first
the
bitterness
completely
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beer
but
as
ive
found
more
and
more
with
founders
beers
and
i
cant
help
but
be
redundant
the
more
you
try
it
its
almost
as
if
it
has
such
a
perfect
medley
of
flavors
that
you
can
choose
the
characteristics
that
you
want
from
it
it
can
either
be
a
bitter
crisp
hoppy
pale
ale
or
a
smooth
malty
sweet
dark
beer
with
beautiful
undertones
of
pine
and
roasted
chestnut
by
meditation
one
can
transcend
the
bitterness
a
definite
addition
to
my
regular
rotation
of
craft
brews
when
its
available
the
palate
is
where
the
100
ibus
are
noticeable
plenty
of
bitterness
earthy
minty
pine
like
with
some
grapefruit
rind
this
is
a
heck
of
bitter
beer
this
is
followed
by
a
moderate
hop
flavor
with
pine
and
some
malt
dark
caramel
cocoa
a
little
toffee
bitterness
drying
and
bitter
on
the
finish
with
lingering
pine
and
grapefruit
this
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
moderately
carbonated
very
nice
pours
a
three
finger
very
light
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
deep
brownruby
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
citrus
hop
nose
and
flavor
is

with

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
berts
better
beers
hooksett
nh
in
all
the
black
malt
is
a
bit
overpowering
not
quite
balanced
id
prefer
just
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
or
body
to
even
things
out
if
that
could
be
done
without
sacrificing
on
the
hops
and
blackness
this
is
a
wonderful
very
dark
strong
hoppy
brew
welldone
o
an
unusual
but
tasty
blend
that
really
sets
this
one
apart
a
terrific
balance
of
malts
and
hops
recommended
yes
this
was
strong
but
the
balance
and
nice
meld
of
flavors
was
what
did
it
for
me
when
it
came
to
masking
the
presence
of
this
beers
strength
there
wasnt
a
lot
of
lacing
in
my
glass
as
there
was
just
a
hint
of
a
few
rings
along
the
back
side
after
each
sip
no
matter
this
had
a
nice
warming
effect
on
me
and
went
down
easily
given
its
potency
the
slight
amount
of
resin
to
the
mouthfeel
combined
with
the
lingering
roasted
nature
of
this
led
to
the
nice
balance
that
i
enjoyed
and
i
look
forward
to
having
another
one
of
these
come
the
dead
of
winter
cheers
mouthfeel
is
dry
very
resinous
overall
pretty
good
beer
overall
well
lets
just
say
that
toothpaste
is
great
and
orange
juice
is
also
great
but
when
you
blend
them
they
suck
same
with
these
flavor
profiles
overall
very
nice
and
typical
of
the
better
versions
of
black
ipa
founders
is
living
up
to
its
reputation
of
producing
enjoyable
and
solid
brews
it
is
very
drinkable
well
balanced
and
covers
the
alcohol
content
well
with
taste
and
feel
great
beer
for
cold
evenings
will
certainly
add
this
to
my
favorites
list
what
you
get
is
a
dark
almost
black
citrusy
ipa
thats
given
a
bit
more
depth
of
character
through
dark
malts
thats
not
to
say
that
other
black
ipas
dont
have
the
same
roastiness
and
bittersweet
chocolate
characteristics
but
theyre
a
little
bit
fuller
here
it
seems
to
teeter
in
fact
sometimes
displaying
more
of
the
citrusy
hops
and
other
times
offering
more
of
the
toastiness
roastiness
nuttiness
deep
caramel
and
darkbittersweet
chocolate
notes
somehow
the
alcohol
never
really
shows
itself
although
there
are
suggestions
of
it
in
the
splash
of
dryness
that
hits
you
at
the
finish
but
again
where
this
beer
could
have
hit
you
with
a
longlingering
bitter
and
roasty
finish
theres
none
of
that
instead
it
somehow
manages
to
squeeze
out
a
bit
of
sweetness
that
seems
like
a
combination
of
very
light
creamy
caramel
and
burnt
or
nearly
burnt
sugar
in
that
way
founders
has
done
an
excellent
job
in
formulating
an
almost
compellingly
drinkable
imperial
black
india
pale
ale
well
worth
trying
o
a
very
hopforward
brew
but
with
roasted
malts
as
a
backbone
the
experience
is
solid
the
brew
an
interesting
mingling
of
styles
that
works
not
an
everyday
brew
and
one
to
select
with
care
because
this
will
trash
your
palate

it

lingers
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
overall
a
darn
good
bolder
of
a
black
ipa
dark
penance
is
something
i
could
have
before
during
or
after
a
meal
depending
on
whats
being
served
its
combination
of
peach
caramel
coffee
and
pine
flavours
affords
it
tremendous
versatility
its
equally
suitable
as
a
little
late
evening
sip
as
it
is
a
sociable
semisessionable
quaffer
a
more
easygoing
offering
than
it
lets
on
dont
be
at
all
afraid
to
pick
up
a
full
four
pack
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
ive
never
been
crazy
about
black
ipas
because
usually
the
roast
taste
over
powers
the
beer
but
this
is
very
smooth
and
the
fruit
taste
is
dynamite
it
just
doesnt
linger
like
a
regular
ipa
the
malts
just
cut
it
short
its
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
grabbing
if
you
dont
even
like
the
style
finishing
off
my
drinking
day
with
my
least
favorite
style
done
my
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
gotta
love
conflict
right
this
stuff
pours
a
very
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
dark
khaki
foam
hm
youd
think
darkness
was
a
theme
here
the
nose
comprises
pine
resin
mixed
greens
and
light
dry
maple
syrup
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strong
vein
of
treacly
roasted
malts
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
pervades
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
drying
finish
overall
though
my
opinion
on
the
style
has
not
changed
founders
has
made
a
black
ipa
that
i
dont
hate
ill
likely
not
have
another
but
the
balance
between
the
bittering
agents
the
hops
and
the
roast
assures
that
at
least
i
wont
be
looking
back
at
this
beer
in
anger
so
no
worries
gallagher
brothers
overall
i
think
this
one
is
what
it
is
if
you
are
looking
for
more
in
your
face
flavors
then
this
is
the
one
you
need
to
go
for
if
you
are
looking
for
a
more
refined
and
polished
beer
wj
is
it
i
found
wj
to
be
really
a
lot
more
balanced
when
trying
them
side
by
side
now
on
a
different
night
this
one
may
taste
different
to
me
but
i
felt
like
wookey
jack
was
the
better
of
the
two
i
am
a
big
fan
of
founders
but
this
one
is
not
among
my
favorites
from
them
ooverall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
much
more
hoppy
than
malty
black
ale
at
first
i
wasnt
so
sure
about
itbut
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
another
solid
brew
by
foundersjust
like
everything
else
they
make
great
beer
got
to
hand
it
to
founders
not
only
do
they
brew
a
black
ipa
but
its
imperial
strength
and
100
ibus
with
that
this
beer
was
not
very
fun
to
drink
over
the
top
bitter
and
the
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
made
me
question
whether
this
was
beer
or
a
gin
mixed
with
a
black
ipa
founders
is
about
pushing
boundaries
and
brewing
beers
for
rebels
and
renegades
so
props
for
staying
true
to
philosophy
however
this
was
a
miss
fire
by
founders
boldly
black
and
relatively
well
balanced
once
it
is
malty
but
doesnt
strike
sweet
given
its
generous
hops
counterbalancing
it
very
solid
black
ipa
the
malt
is
fantastic
but
the
hops
need
to
shine
a
bit
more
not
my
favorite
style
but
founders
makes
a
good
one
dark
malt
start
then
slight
ipa
finish
overall
it
is
hard
to
find
a
founders
release
that
disappoints
with
this
one
we
found
a
hugely
surprising
degree
of
bittering
char
and
leathery
bite
from
the
massive
malt
character
unlike
your
typical
black
ipa
however
we
missed
that
overly
sweetened
hop
profile
to
bring
you
into
that
beautiful
blend
that
you
look
for
with
that
said
this
was
a
very
simple
beer
to
compare
last
years
inspired
artist
took
on
that
fantastic
balance
with
fruitiness
of
hops
big
enough
to
meet
the
dark
malt
profile
here
with
a
presumably
imperial
version
of
that
recipe
the
char
takes
us
to
a
whole
new
level
of
darkness
that
lets
little
escape
beyond
it
we
have
been
sitting
on
this
one
a
couple
weeks
longer
than
most
everyone
else
but
we
dont
feel
that
the
hops
would
fade
much
in
that
time
to
allow
for
such
a
presentation
overall
i
treated
it
like
a
dipa
just
the
way
it
tasted
true
hoppy
taste
with
the
right
touch
of
bitter
fruit
o
an
excellent
imperial
black
ipa
this
one
packs
a
punch
too
o
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
an
enjoyable
version
12

in

city
ia
bottled
on
11102014
poured
into
my
smoke
snifter
glass
drank
over
30
minutes
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
nearly
everything
from
founders
is
top
notch
and
this
is
no
exception
in
this
style
this
would
have
to
be
up
at
the
top
with
stones
sublimely
selfrighteous
and
firestone
walker
wookey
jack
o
at
100
ibus
this
one
packs
a
huge
hop
punch
that
stands
out
even
among
a
nice
roasty
malt
base
a
welcomed
addition
to
their
year
round
lineup
pours
an
extraordinarily
deep
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
just
wont
give
up
the
head
has
nice
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
i
get
is
big
pine
and
floral
hops
the
taste
is
equally
huge
in
the
hops
department
with
the
malt
backbone
subtly
holding
the
whole
thing
up
adding
just
enough
sweetness
and
smoothing
out
what
could
be
an
overwhelming
hops
assault
the
body
is
nicely
weighted
and
smooth
on
the
palate
this
is
a
delicious
hop
bomb
o
i
thought
this
really
was
a
well
done
black
ipa
one
of
the
few
generally
available
that
could
stand
on
its
own
to
stones
sublimely
selfrighteous
big
flavors
big
bitterness
but
with
a
malt
backbone
that
can
take
it
very
nice
and
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
overall
when
i
first
saw
this
i
thought
the
price
was
high
but
seeing
the
high
octane
abv
and
the
smooth
blend
its
hard
to
not
justify
the
price
will
i
get
it
again
hard
to
say
strong
malt
backbone
less
bitterness
o
a
solid
black
ale
but
nothing
to
stand
out
from
many
others
ive
had
if
there
is
suppose
to
be
a
malt
presents
here
it
is
completely
masked
all
that
is
here
is
a
supper
thick
resinous
pine
hop
and
alcohol
bum
if
that
is
you
thing
go
for
it
not
something
i
care
to
drink
again
overall
this
is
a
reminder
of
why
i
love
founders
o
a
very
complex
beer
hops
impart
both
piney
and
tropical
flavors
also
a
lot
of
malt
to
balance
out
the
hops
great
beer
black
in
color
and
yet
it
does
show
some
transparency
when
held
up
to
light
a
trace
of
head
is
just
detectable
on
the
majority
of
the
beer
and
is
more
apparent
around
the
rim
brussels
lacing
aggressive
aroma
of
piny
hops
with
dark
malt
as
a
background
note
that
piny
hop
flavor
starts
off
very
boldly
and
then
is
slowly
tempered
by
sweet
dark
malt
the
fade
again
features
the
piny
hops
and
the
finish
is
sweet
and
dry
the
mouth
is
also
sticky
from
the
abundant
pine
like
hops
taste
starts
out
with
a
roasty
toasty
malt
backing
which
quickly
gives
way
to
a
strong
pine
hop
bitterness
a
good
balance
between
the
two
with
the
hops
taking
the
lasting
edge
nice
soft
yet
ample
carbonation
finishes
slightly
dry
and
makes
you
wanting
another
sip
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
black
ipa
is
very
smooth
and
balanced
almost
to
a
fault
i
just
got
done
drinking
a
black
rajah
and
while
that
had
a
much
lower
abv
it
had
a
much
higher
hop
profile
this
is
a
much
smoother
well
rounded
ipa
overall
a
damn
good

trying

o
black

are
all
over
the

but
this
one
is
strong
in
its
ipa
roots
while
adding
a
nice
dark
juicy
touch
hop
flavors
are
excellent
awesome
beer
o
there
is
a
great
black
ipa
in
my
glass
but
it
is
overwhelmed
by
far
too
much
bitterness
to
elevate
it
to
that
level
you
get
touches
of
all
the
great
flavors
you
want
in
a
black
ipa
in
this
beer
but
the
bitterness
obstructs
it
a
little
too
much
i
like
dry
ipas
but
this
was
arid
if
i
wasnt
such
a
fan
of
hoppy
dry
beers
this
could
be
a
disaster
i
liked
it
but
wasnt
in
love
with
it
a
bit
of
chewiness
and
malt
would
help
this
tremendously
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
so
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
them
i
just
dont
think
i
would
of
all
the
black
ipas
ive
had
this
stands
squarely
among
the
best
of
the
best
wow
leave
it
to
founders
to
make
short
work
of
even
the
most
troublesome
styles
the
beer
taste
while
maintaining
the
same
notes
is
a
bit
stronger
in
the
hops
department
the
beer
is
most
certainly
hoppy
and
citrus
but
the
roast
does
dial
it
back
a
little
bit
and
adds
a
stronger
chocolaty
flavor
with
a
slightly
roasted
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
bodied
with
biting
carbonation
overall
a
fantastic
american
black
ale
and
most
certainly
worth
getting
overall
great
tasting
aba
nice
juicy
and
resiny
hop
flavor
to
go
with
the
typical
malt
bill
you
would
expect
from
this
style
wish
i
had
another
one
overall
one
of
the
best
hoppy
black
ale
ranked
close
to
stone
fits
somewhere
right
in
the
middle
of
a
notsocrowded
but
highly
competitive
pack
a
solid
black
ipa
that
died
tend
towards
the
dry
perhaps
west
coast
side
of
ipa
the
black
aspects
are
present
if
just
a
bit
overshadowed
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
feel
a
good
representation
nevertheless
a
very
fine
effort
and
one
of
the
best
black
ales
that
i
have
had
the
pleasure
to
sample
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
quickly
fleeting
tan
head
that
leaves
some
stickies
on
the
way
down
dank
resinous
pine
with
a
hint
of
citrus
caramel
and
bitter
chocolate
bring
up
the
maltiness
hides
the
alcohol
quite
well
very
nice
black
ipa
overall
a
decent
but
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
centennial
is
not
my
favorite
strand
of
hops
if
you
love
black
ipas
check
it
out
but
not
one
id
seek
out
too
often
founders
dark
penance
is
an
opaque
midnight
black
with
a
thin
white
cap
atop
this
mighty
looking
brew
the
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
is
so
fresh
and
bright
one
might
think
some
sort
of
witchcraft
was
involved
in
its
creation
now
as
for
the
flavor
the
hops
come
through
with
more
of
a
resinous
piny
taste
finishing
very
dry
and
coarsely
bitter
just
as
a
devoted
hophead
would
desire
theres
a
touch
of
molasses
but
not
much
roasted
malt
in
the
case
of
this
black
ipa
the
malts
sort
of
give
the
beer
a
backbone
and
they
add
mostly
to
full
out
the
body
and
mouth
feel
overall
not
what
i
typically
expect
to
find
in
a
black
ipa
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
reddish
brown
body
with
a
small
head
atop
the
look
was
closer
to
a
darker
barleywine
than
a
stout
the
aroma
was
a
lovely
mix
of
citrus
from
the
hops
a
hefty
dose
of
pine
and
then
some
cherry
from
the
dark
malt
the
taste
was
very
dry
from
the
bitter
hops
which
tasted
like
pine
and
grapefruit
with
some
astringency
from
the
roasted
malt
there
was
a
hint
of
toffee
and
vanilla
in
the
finish
the
body
was
quite
thick
for
the
style
and
mouthfeel
full
of
burnt
malt
astringency
but
with
a
soft
texture
this
was
much
more
of
a
sipper
than
most
dipa
beers
like
the
most
bitterdark
chocolate
ive
ever
tasted
they
nailed
it
this
was
really
damn
fresh
2
weeks
in
the
bottle
poured
into
the
spiegelau
glass
deep
dark
showed
a
hint
of
ruby
when
held
in
the
light
very
little
head
aromas
were
juicy
with
citrus
some
mango
clean
and
bitter
notes
probably
the
best
smelling
bipa
i
have
seen
and
right
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
smelling
ipadipas
for
me
nice
bitterness
up
front
the
juicy
nose
was
alive
on
the
tongue
maybe
needed
a
bit
more
of
the
malt
presence
but
overall
good
balance
great
ipa
mouthfeel
a
little
heavier
but
not
syrupy
overall
a
very
good
representation
for
the
style
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
feel
of
this
one
is
perfectly
smooth
while
yet
retaining
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
really
another
great
brew
from
my
favorite
overall
brewery
this
is
lights
out
black
ipa
its
why
lighter
in
the
roast
than
others
getting
its
dark
died
not
so
much
from
roasted
barley
but
from
a
dark
wheat
malt
less
intense
darkness
and
nowhere
near
the
bitterness
double
jeopardy
that
sometimes
results
it
still
feels
delicate
despite
being
enormous
well
bubbly
and
not
real
thick
or
heavy
in
body
or
texture
the
hops
are
very
obviously
centennial
focused
which
works
great
with
the
grain
super
hoppy
this
one
but
not
overdone
the
alcohol
is
invisible
in
the
drinking
experience
until
the
buzz
is
considered
which
is
substantial
even
after
just
a
bit
of
this
heady
hops
here
super
dank
and
jazzy
long
finishing
one
of
the
better
black
ipa
types
going
right
now
just
lovely
from
the
tap
a
hint
of
pepper
in
the
finish
with
the
hops
so
dynamic
and
well
made
founders
you
have
outdone
yourselves
o
a
very
drinkable
well
balanced
version
of
a
style
that
often
lacks
both
of
these
traits
to
my
tastes
this
is
bracingly
bitter
to
the
point
of
being
overwhelming
i
love
hop
flavor
and
this
has
tons
of
it
but
the
bitterness
is
just
to
much
finishing
one
bottle
is
a
struggle
if
you
really
love
bitter
hop
bomb
black
ipas
youll
enjoy
this
solid
black
ale
but
missing
a
little
something
a
tad
too
much
pine
needs
some
more
black
characteristics
toffee
cocoa
maybe
even
some
oat
or
sweetness
would
be
appreciated
to
balance
this
out
a
fingers
worth
of
ultra
rich
ultra
dense
and
ultra
creamy
light
khaki
colored
froth
at
first
glance
this
one
appears
mostly
still
but
under
closer
examination
this
one
is
bursting
with
quick
carbonation
throughout
the
color
walks
a
fine
line
between
dark
brown
and
black
it
is
also
fairly
translucent
especially
when
back
lit
a
good
bit
of
froth
clings
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
fairly
subdued
but
pleasant
aroma
of
lightly
roasted
malt
and
faint
piney
hop
resins
the
aroma
is
a
perfect
predictor
of
the
palate
the
lightly
roasted
malt
and
piney
hop
presence
compete
for
prominence
and
partake
in
an
enjoyable
dance
the
mouthfeel
is
utterly
exquisite
and
outstanding
medium
bodied
insanely
rich
insanely
smooth
a
bit
chewy
lit
carbonation
this
one
is
a
world
class
american
black
ale
it
hides
its
8
9
abv
when
founders
decided
to
add
a
black
ipa
to
their
yearround
lineup
you
would
expect
it
to
be
excellent
but
this
one
exceeds
those
lofty
expectations
black
hoppy
stout
thick
beige
head
well
done
founderd
nice
strong
hop
bitter
finish
strong
malt
and
hop
handles
the
alcohol
level
nicely
o
nice
complexity
but
its
a
bit
over
the
top
with
its
bitterness
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
doubt
id
choose
to
come
back
to
it
again
in
the
future
o
very
happy
and
glad
i
picked
this
up
it
has
been
a
few
months
since
i
had
a
uinta
dubhe
but
i
would
love
to
do
these
2
beers
side
by
side
my
memory
says
i
liked
dubhe
better
i
feel
dubhe
was
a
bit
more
complex
and
balanced
hop
and
malt
but
i
would
have
to
double
check
that
shame
this
is
so
big
otherwise
i
would
drive
to
the
store
to
get
some
overall
i
usually
dont
dig
black

this
one
is
no
exception
dark

this
is
definitely
an
awesome
beer
on
a
personal
note
the
hop
bitterness
is
a
little
too
powerful
im
really
big
into
the
massive
imperial
stouts
but
i
can
appreciate
a
good
ipa
and
this
is
definitely
that
i
always
say
founders
can
do
no
wrong
glass
snifter
taste
is
big
this
is
a
9
4
but
balanced
well
with
citrus
and
pine
hops
and
a
deep
roasted
chocolate
and
slight
coffee
tone
very
tasty
and
one
i
will
revisit
and
review
from
future
bottles
founders
dark
penance
45
overall
a
great
black
ipa
i
bought
a
whole
case
and
dont
regret
it
starts
out
interesting
but
fades
to
a
bitter
dark
blah
this
has
a
more
lemony
citrus
tone
sweet
and
sour
fruits
with
an
orchard
like
flavor
the
hops
continue
in
a
grapefruit
rind
pine
resin
floral
and
herbaceous
tone
the
backdrop
is
a
light
charred
malt
but
the
hop
profile
is
more
dominant
this
has
a
dry
yet
bitter
finish
but
drinks
with
ease
and
heft
this
isnt
wookey
jack
but
its
a
good
rendition
of
the
style
o
just
another
really
good
beer
from
founders
absolutely
worth
a
try
overall
it
really
isnt
a
beer
that
really
elevates
or
showcases
hop
flavor
with
dark
roasted
malts
it
just
gives
you
a
bitter
dark
beer
without
a
lot
of
flavor
components
or
complexity
pretty
average
fare
take
it
or
leave
it
overall
very
bitter
for
the
style
and
abv
while
this
is
primarily
an
ipa
the
malts
do
push
this
toward
imperial
red
and
black
territory
overall
a
very
well
done
black
ipa
from
the
look
of
it
i
didnt
see
that
big
smack
of
hops
coming
but
it
delivers
on
the
ipa
front
the
body
is
a
bit
boozy
compared
to
other
bigger
ipas
but
it
balances
with
the
bitter
and
roasty
notes
its
pretty
bitter
but
not
overly
so
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
a
beer
id
pick
up
in
the
season
o
black
ipas
are
a
hard
sell
for
me
and
i
tend
not
to
try
them
unless
theyre
from
a
brewery
that
a
trust
to
always
pull
through
founders
is
one
of
those
breweries
with
as
many
flavors
at
play
here
theyre
walking
a
veritable
tightrope
the
dark
penance
never
feels
cobbled
together
but
somehow
feels
as
though
heavy
citrus
hops
and
dark
bitter
malts
were
meant
to
be
together
something
that
i
rarely
feel
with
other
beers
in
the
style
it
paired
beautifully
some
musky
blue
stilton
cheese
and
made
a
perfect
nightcap
bravo
had
this
with
some
peanuts
roasted
with
cayenne
and
boy
did
they
kick
each
other
off
like
frank
dux
and
ogre
playing
karate
champ
good
beer
but
the
bitterness
thru
me
off
o
it
is
a
good
beer
it
leans
too
much
towards
the
citrus
for
my
liking
in
this
style
i
prefer
a
balance
of
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hops
more
like
a
hoppy
porter
or
stout
the
bitterness
overwhelms
the
roasted
malt
creating
a
grapefruit
dominant
flavor
profile
i
love
the
fell
of
this
beer
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
complex
india
pale
ale
overall
my
impression
was
of
a
tropical
blackberry
hop
profile
in
a
charred
stout
that
feels
more
toward
a
dipa
different
to
me
and
its
hard
not
to
get
a
muddled
impression
i
dont
usually
go
for
black
ales
unless
theyre
imperial
stouts
but
i
can
tell
this
is
wellcrafted
for
what
its
set
to
be
one
of
the
most
bitter
beers
i
can
think
of
im
a
hophead
but
imo
the
bitterness
is
overwhelming
coming
from
two
different
directions
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
obviously
hop
up
front
is
citrusylight
tropical
hops
then
its
all
over
the
roasted
malt
takes
over
with
bitter
chocolate
and
bitter
coffee
then
a
long
dry
hop
bitter
finish
did
i
say
bitter
yet
this
beer
is
well
made
for
the
style
but
id
back
off
the
ibus
a
touch
and
let
some
of
the
other
players
get
in
the
game
fantastic
looking
fellow
here
dismal
darkness
that
swallows
light
and
class
only
to
give
up
all
that
bad
ass
with
a
whimsical
little
beige
lacy
top
piece
dark
fancy
and
fun
all
at
once
little
bit
of
earthiness
in
an
otherwise
sharp
nose
of
hop
dances
bitter
as
all
hell
at
first
well
throughout
actually
a
little
citrus
at
first
touch
of
old
fashioned
licorice
on
the
finish
and
finally
a
velvety
sheet
on
the
tongue
dsrn
fun
this
fellow
o
a
new
set
in
stone
seasonal
from
founders
i
sure
hope
so
this
is
an
amazing
black
ale
and
an
instant
favorite
in
the
style
for
me
it
has
the
class
of
a
great
brewery
and
the
depth
of
an
always
growing
style
i
say
bring
on
some
dark
penance
every
fall
its
grand
stuff
pretty
good
tasting
and
crafted
black
ipa
abv
is
well
hidden
a
nice
take
on
the
style
one
i
would
buy
again
if
a
seasonal
offering
thought
i
liked
it
better
a
few
weeks
earlier
i
really
liked
this
maybe
my
favorite
founders
beer
had
this
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
a
very
very
dark
brown
the
flavor
is
intense
hoppy
with
heavy
malt
pine
and
smoke
the
mouthfeel
is
super
smooth
outstanding
very
nice
cold
weather
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
was
still
disappointed
maybe
founders
reputation
came
into
play
a
little
but
i
try
to
call
em
as
i
taste
em
i
was
expecting
a
lagunitas
nighttime
this
one
is
just
too
unbalanced
for
me
i
feel
that
a
black
ipa
should
have
distinct
noticeable
porter
qualities
maybe
i
am
wrong
certainly
worthy
of
the
100
ibu
label
if
you
are
looking
for
something
more
toward
the
ipa
end
of
the
spectrum
this
wont
disappoint
you
overall
its
good
but
nothing
really
unique
if
i
were
blindfolded
i
wonder
if
i
would
pick
out
that
it
was
a
black
ipa
until
the
very
finish
o
a
really
good
beer
im
not
generally
a
big
black
ipa
fan
id
much
rather
have
a
stout
or
an
ipa
but
this
is
good
much
more
toward
the
ipa
side
than
the
black
side
the
only
thing
i
can
possibly
think
here
is
that
me
and
centennial
hops
have
a
hatehate
relationship
i
usually
enjoy
founders
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
no
real
outstanding
smell
to
speak
of
definitely
worth
trying
plenty
of
assertive
hop
aromas
vaguely
medicinal
grapefruit
zest
and
lots
of
pine
odd
but
appealing
malt
balance
charred
sugar
hints
of
dark
cocoa
some
boozy
vanilla
as
well
smells
great
tastes
better
abrasively
balanced
if
that
makes
sense
burnt
sugar
and
bitter
cocoa
plus
resinous
pine
and
grapefruit
pith
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
kicked
ass
hugely
impressive
but
the
beer
is
a
real
sledgehammer
and
is
just
a
little
bit
out
of
control
its
a
true
hop
bomb
but
i
would
want
some
balance
on
this
it
is
though
extremely
grand
and
very
fun
but
if
this
was
rounded
out
a
bit
with
some
malt
depth
and
character
it
might
very
well
have
been
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
ever
had
overall
in
all
honesty
i
have
been
uniformly
disappointed
by
black
ipas
until
now
its
an
extremely
difficult
style
to
get
right
but
founders
really
hit
it
out
of
the
park
phenomenal
balance
vibrant
hops
and
the
perfect
amount
of
roasted
malt
presence
not
one
of
founders
better
hoppy
beers
but
it
seems
to
just
be
my
opinion
on
it
as
most
people
seem
to
like
it
so
far
this
is
a
followup
after
black
rajah
not
an
intentional
tasting
of
styles
but
a
nice
coincidence
nice
profile
kind
of
tangy
more
so
than
i
would
hope
for
as
it
robs
it
of
any
firm
smooth
characteristics
its
decent
but
not
really
on
the
level
of
others
in
its
style
an
okay
black
ale
that
gains
nothing
being
an
imperial
version
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
think
is
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
malts
well
worth
a
second
purchase
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
founders
although
i
would
not
say
they
really
knocked
this
out
of
the
park
the
notion
of
an
imperial
black
ipa
hardly
makes
sense
as
that
basically
translates
to
a
superhoppy
stout
and
that
is
what
this
tastes
like
both
hops
and
malts
really
shine
but
overall
it
still
tastes
a
bit
muddled
with
a
little
too
much
booze
overall
its
an
amazing
example
of
a
style
that
i
dont
really
like
even
though
i
wont
drink
it
often
they
do
actually
pull
off
a
style
that
i
think
is
awful
in
most
of
the
examples
ive
had
both
the
hops
and
the
malts
contribute
notable
characteristics
and
they
all
actually
do
work
together
i
think
the
intense
bitterness
as
absurd
as
it
is
does
help
boost
the
hops
above
the
malts
so
at
least
it
serves
a
purpose
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
i
dont
know
black
ipas
very
well
at
all
but
this
is
one
of
the
more
balanced
ones
ive
had
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
with
a
malt
body
and
some
subtle
chocolate
tones
which
is
pretty
much
all
i
want
from
the
style
ojust
the
lack
of
balance
hurts
the
beer
if
it
was
dialed
in
more
it
could
have
been
a
lot
better
edit
just
a
quick
note
this
beer
is
quite
a
lot
better
after
its
warmed
up
for
about
half
an
hour
or
so
the
bitterness
is
less
intense
the
beer
tastes
a
little
juicier

overall
a
nice
beer
for
the
price
but
not
one
im
dying
to
have
again
overall
totally
disappointing
as
well
as
wookey
jack
represents
the
style
dogzilla
represents
poorly
o
very
disappointed
total
wine
ba
score
is
a
lie
because
it
rated
it
as
a
93
and
for
3
99
for
a
pint
i
thought
this
would
be
a
steal
was
definitely
the
opposite
i
think
everyone
is
rating
this
as
an
ipa
it
definitely
isnt
that
it
tastes
more
like
a
light
stout
pours
dark
not
quit
pitch
black
but
very
dark
brown
no
clarity
at
all
small
head
that
doesnt
really
last
virtually
no
lacing
has
a
roasted
almost
sweet
smell
maybe
chocolate
maybe
caramel
the
smell
is
the
best
quality
dark
malty
up
front
taste
with
a
moderately
bitter
roasted
aftertaste
again
maybe
chocolate
sweet
could
be
raisins
there
a
dark
fruity
taste
virtually
no
bitterness
from
hops
it
is
lacking
balance
not
bad
but
would
buy
many
other
beers
before
this
one
wouldnt
ever
turn
it
down
though
on
tap
to
a
tulip
glass
pours
deep
black
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
smell
was
decent
but
nothing
really
popped
to
me
to
be
honest
taste
was
minimally
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
smoke
malt
very
drinkable
but
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
hoppy
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
to
be
honest
overall
it
was
okay
although
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
opening
this
got
to
say
im
a
little
let
down
by
it
on
a
few
levels
poured
from
a
22
oz
bottle
into
a
stemmed
glass
wonderful
dark
brown
but
with
no
head
only
clear
bubbles
around
the
glass
smell
of
rum
soaked
raisins
and
a
faint
chemical
hint
possibly
the
sweet
smell
of
antifreeze
smell
not
taste
was
present
the
taste
started
out
bitter
and
flat
bitter
is
fine
but
the
flat
was
like
a
true
old
style
porter
this
is
not
a
porter
so
it
didnt
settle
well
alcohol
and
some
hops
bitterness
are
about
the
only
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
seems
to
start
out
thin
and
then
settles
medium
on
the
tongue
as
a
side
note
as
you
drink
this
the
hops
come
out
in
the
aftertaste
ive
had
a
few
black
ipas
and
this
is
not
among
the
good
ones
overall
i
think
maybe
this
might
be
infected
because
ive
read
reviews
about
massive
foam
and
some
with
the
clear
bubbles
that
i
had
either
way
its
not
what
i
want
in
a
black
ipa
or
any
beer
for
that
matter
might
try
it
again
if
the
price
is
right
medium
bodied
and
strange
considering
the
pouring
explosion
not
overly
carbonated
just
medium
for
the
style
all
told
it
isnt
a
drain
pour
but
the
thought
did
cross
my
mind
heres
hoping
its
just
a
bad
bottle
but
i
doubt
ill
have
this
one
again
2nd
afterthought
this
just
may
be
infected
extremely
volatile
but
nice
head
wish
i
could
get
some
head
this
good
o
not
a
great
beer
the
beer
looks
like
cocacola
without
the
fizz
it
smells
of
chocolate
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
but
not
really
my
thing
but
the
taste
oh
god
the
taste
it
doesnt
work
the
chocolate
stout
notes
dont
mesh
well
with
the
light
citruspine
notes
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
its
not
a
good
beer
either
the
rest
was
used
to
cook
food
i
expect
way
more
from
laughing
dog
than
laughs
at
this
attempt
at
mockery
o
i
cannot
believe
how
bad
this
is
the
smell
and
taste
is
so
far
offtarget
from
where
it
should
be
i
dont
know
where
these
weird
flavors
come
from
but
laughing
dog
do
yourself
a
favor
and
dump
this
recipe
down
the
drain
with
the
rest
of
this
beer
overall
delicuous
very
sharp
on
the
palate
but
nice
flavors
and
balance
will
try
again
hope
to
have
better
results
next
time
overall
yeah
a
completely
and
unquestionable
infected
bottle
a
certain
candidate
for
a
future
rereview
but
i
have
to
admit
i
sort
of
enjoy
this
can
a
belgian
black
ipa
be
that
far
off
are
they
already
being
made
22
ounce
bottle
killer
label
of
the
dogzilla
attacking
the
town
simcoe
and
cascade
in
a
black
ipa
from
idaho
man
are
we
getting
progressive
did
i
mention
i
purchased
this
in
west
virginia
holy
shit
whats
going
on
the
body
is
pitch
black
with
a
light
beige
head
almost
white
ive
never
seen
a
head
this
light
in
a
beer
this
dark
aromatics
are
giving
off
citrus
and
spicy
notes
almost
a
cinnamon
like
character
if
i
had
to
describe
it
any
further
the
first
sips
carries
that
black
roast
blended
with
high
alpha
acid
hops
rather
nicely
drinks
like
a
highly
carbonated
schwarzbier
with
more
hop
pellet
kick
than
most
of
them
out
there
the
spicy
characteristic
is
nice
and
would
blend
great
with
the
kristoff
sumatran
wrapped
cigar
im
about
to
light
up
light
dark
chocolate
herbal
mint
spicy
hops
mild
citrus
twang
but
really
ends
up
as
a
nice
spicy
schwarzbier
more
than
a
black
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
at
best
with
ample
flowing
carbonation
a
layer
of
spice
and
hop
bitterness
is
left
on
the
palate
between
sips
overall
a
beer
that
i
will
drink
sparingly
not
the
one
i
wanted
compared
to
other
big
dark
beers
out
there
im
glad
the
alcohol
is
not
over
the
top
its
well
hidden
and
barely
a
factor
in
this
big
beast
of
a
22
ounce
beer
oh
no
they
say
hes
got
to
go
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
midnight
garnet
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
wan
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
anise
pine
needles
spearmint
and
cinnamon
odd
as
it
may
sound
this
thing
smells
like
certain
christmas
cookies
ive
had
in
my
day
almost
like
a
gingerbread
man
with
peppermint
buttons
who
happened
to
have
been
left
on
the
baking
pan
a
bit
too
long
blackening
the
backside
a
bit
here
its
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
and
luckily
not
entirely
offensive
especially
considering
that
the
mint
gets
stronger
as
time
progresses
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
that
minty
character
is
now
nearly
absent
until
the
finish
the
roast
is
darker
and
more
bitter
and
the
pine
asserts
itself
a
great
deal
more
unfortunately
everything
is
in
competition
with
everything
else
precluding
any
chance
of
flavor
harmony
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
fairly
smooth
feel
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
black
ipa
just
didnt
sit
right
with
me
what
with
the
chaotic
nature
of
the
flavors
o
decent
black
ipa
definitely
piney
on
the
hops
with
a
decent
dark
coffeecaramel
malt
backbone
neither
quality
overwhelms
not
a
black
ipa
id
choose
to
revisit
but
it
is
relatively
good
its
got
some
flavors
but
most
of
them
are
undesirable
flavors
if
you
want
to
try
it
then
try
it
but
it
probably
wont
be
a
beer
that
you
try
twice
overall
its
ok
but
not
outstanding
o
ive
had
other
laughing
dog
beers
i
loved
but
this
black
ipa
tasted
strange
and
off
i
would
try
again
only
if
bottled
fresh
or
from
a
tap
finishing
taste
is
almost
like
sarasparilla
that
with
the
carbonation
adding
to
the
rootbeer
experience
o
it
is
a
flavorful
beer
but
that
citrus
and
orange
presence
just
reminds
me
of
cleaning
products
it
is
kind
of
a
turn
off
overall
unfortunately
misses
the
mark
disappointing
picked
this
up
recently
as
i
had
tried
several
black
ipas
during
the
craze
a
few
years
ago
and
liked
them
mostly
packaging
caught
my
eye
also
and
looked
forward
to
trying
this
bomber
the
beer
poured
a
dark
reddish
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
prodigious
head
of
lumpy
ochre
foam
creating
a
sticky
mess
in
the
kitchen
aroma
of
roasty
malt
and
citrus
was
somewhat
promising
the
taste
was
overly
bitter
even
for
a
west
coast
ipaenthusiast
very
hard
to
finish
although
it
improved
as
it
warmed
overall
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
o
this
beer
seems
to
be
overcarbonated
and
requires
a
very
careful
pour
nothing
really
stands
out
to
me
about
the
smell
or
tasted
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
all
in
all
dogzilla
is
a
worthy
journey
into
the
cdabipa
style
perhaps
not
the
most
assertive
example
but
sufficiently
complex
and
wellcrafted
to
put
a
smile
on
the
face
of
the
beer
drinker
that
likes
dark
earthy
beers
the
kind
that
make
us
californians
want
to
move
to
the
northwest
i
picked
this
up
based
soley
on
my
recently
discovered
affection
for
black
ipas
after
reading
some
of
the
other
reviews
i
was
really
apprehensive
i
am
pleased
to
report
my
experience
was
100
enjoyable
this
brew
poured
with
the
expected
dark
color
and
had
a
pleasent
roasted
nut
scent
the
taste
was
smooth
and
went
down
easy
i
would
visit
this
dogpen
again
the
taste
is
better
than
average
for
sure
loads
of
dry
roasted
malt
the
hops
have
a
great
aroma
and
slick
feeling
the
dark
chocolate
works
pretty
well
with
the
slick
citrus
fruits
theres
just
enough
punch
from
the
hops
the
bitterness
from
the
malt
just
gets
compounded
by
the
bitter
hop
extract
oils
22
oz
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
i
was
really
excited
to
try
this
one
because
of
the
spiffy
name
and
awesome
artwork
honestly
i
shouldve
just
taken
a
picture
of
the
bottle
because
it
was
all
downhill
once
i
opened
it
first
of
all
the
head
was
huge
it
would
almost
be
more
appropriate
to
measure
it
in
hands
instead
of
fingers
the
color
was
almost
jet
black
and
the
smell
was
floral
and
hoppy
but
smelled
oddly
dank
for
lack
of
a
better
term
the
taste
was
not
good
burnt
but
not
roasty
like
you
expect
from
dark
malts
and
although
it
smelled
floral
it
tasted
really
bitter
not
floral
and
finished
even
worse
also
it
was
too
dry
and
reminded
me
of
a
really
cheap
cabernet
stay
away
there
are
better
bipas
out
there
this
beer
is
way
overcarbonated
i
couldnt
drink
it
out
of
a
glass
because
the
enormous
head
never
settled
i
had
to
drink
most
of
it
from
the
bottle
the
carbonation
hit
my
mouth
like
an
explosion
and
was
not
pleasant
but
this
wasnt
the
worst
part
of
the
beer
the
beer
finishes
with
an
awful
medicinal
taste
that
lingers
in
the
mouth
the
nauseating
taste
stayed
with
me
long
after
i
drank
the
beer
i
definitely
wont
drink
this
beer
again
overall
laughing
dog
brewery
if
you
read
this
retire
this
beer
you
and
i
both
know
you
have
come
out
with
much
better
than
this
still
you
can
give
it
a
try
might
be
worth
your
while
definitely
not
mine
salud
so
on
the
whole
id
say
its
worth
a
shot
i
liked
it
but
it
was
unbalanced
and
took
me
for
a
ride
which
is
fun
too
this
beer
pour
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
trace
of
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
with
grapefruit
hoppiness
the
taste
starts
with
that
strong
fruity
and
citrusy
hops
and
then
donates
with
some
malty
sweetness
the
overall
taste
impression
is
very
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
and
overcarbonated
overall
though
a
very
interesting
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
o
while
id
probably
drink
more
of
stones
sublimely
self
righteous
i
think
this
is
a
an
easier
drinking
alternative
due
to
the
fact
thats
its
far
less
sweet
has
a
thinner
body
and
more
bright
hop
characteristics
so
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
cheers
the
taste
is
has
the
distinct
flavors
of
pine
bark
lemon
raw
cocoa
beans
with
a
punch
of
sharp
bitterness
at
the
end
its
simple
yet
complex
the
body
is
mediumfull
but
feels
light
in
the
mouth
not
too
bad
a
no
fuss
bipa
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
necessarily
measure
up
to
other
beers
of
the
style
o
i
liked
the
citrus
hops
used
but
found
all
the
dark
malts
of
be
a
little
to
much
for
this
style
in
my
opinion
however
they
did
work
well
for
this
beer
i
could
have
used
more
hops
in
its
flavor
and
smell
but
thought
this
was
still
worth
the
5
59
i
paid
for
the
22oz
o
ok
becomes
more
bitter
on
the
last
pour
grassy
pine
needlelike
bitterness
over
roast
not
juicy
or
containing
the
chocolate
malt
sweetness

i

for
this

let
it
warm
some

then
with

the

in

linger
for
quite

wouldnt
cook
with
this
worth
checking
out
not
what
i
expected
for
a
black
ipa
but
a
very
well
made
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
a
strange
bird
ok
dog
this
one
many
of
its
traits
resemble
a
decent
pac
nw
black
ipa
however
the
strange
herbal
and
isolated
anise
characters
just
dont
really
do
it
for
me
which
is
a
minor
shame
as
the
restrained
blackened
part
of
the
style
here
is
actually
quite
appealing
huh
when
one
door
opens
another
one
closes
i
suppose
got
this
one
expecting
a
black
ipa
i
guess
not
everyones
definition
of
this
is
the
same
i
thought
roasted
malts
with
plentiful
hops
this
was
neither
black
nor
ipa
the
overall
persona
here
is
just
a
tad
dialeddown
but
its
strong
suit
is
drinkability
as
its
balanced
and
quietly
nuanced
enough
to
consider
tackling
multiple
bombers
in
one
sitting
though
ones
attention
may
begin
to
wander
d
the
pineapple
scent
and
astringent
flavor
was
unexpected
and
disagreeable
at
first
as
was
the
massive
head
as
i
drank
through
the
22
oz
the
flavor
grew
on
me
and
the
creamy
texture
was
solid
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
all
that
often
however
flavor
is
similarly
puzzling
its
sweet
and
boozy
and
the
leafyherbal
hop
profile
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
not
nearly
roasty
enough
for
the
cda
style
some
major
tweaks
are
needed
here
ive
had
some
nice
brews
from
laughing
dog
but
i
cant
recommend
this
one
good
if
somewhat
light
carbonation
mildly
high
abv
but
not
alcohol
burn
i
cant
see
this

well

together

some
others
ive
encountered
but
i
remember
seeing
this
before
most
of
those
as
well
perhaps
its
time
to
tweak
this
recipe
i
think
the
potential
is
there
d
this
does
not
taste
right
its
just
bad
really
its
slick
gritty
acidic
and
really
horrible
maybe
its
infected
with
all
the
talk
of
ld
sucking
lately
avoid
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
thick
looking
stoutlike
black
liquid
the
head
was
big
and
tan
colored
the
lacing
was
thick
along
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
citrusy
with
hops
and
heavily
roasted
with
chocolate
malts
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
also
the
chocolatey
richness
blended
quite
well
with
the
piny
citrus
flavors
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
has
a
healthy
carbonation
to
it
overall
i
found
this
black
ipa
to
be
quite
good
and
would
drink
it
again
in
the
future
average
effort
at
best
i
gave
dogzilla
a
shot
but
im
pouring
out
the
other
half
bottle
and
passing
the
next
time
im
offered
it
is
it
possible
i
had
a
bad
bottle
i
dont
know
this
beer
is
too
weird
to
be
good
if
this
is
the
way
its
supposed
to
taste
ill
pass
next
time
nice
and
even
brown
color
with
a
good
clarity
to
it
a
nice
rich
looking
head
of
light
tan
rose
up
from
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
reached
a
height
of
around
two
fingers
before
settling
back
down
with
a
smooth
and
even
lacing
and
a
nice
consistency
hugging
the
glass
aroma
is
a
good
bit
hoppier
up
front
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
as
well
this
one
just
seemed
to
be
full
of
surprises
rich
caramel
and
earthy
grains
lie
underneath
a
bouquet
of
pine
like
hops
quite
light
and
very
complex
i
was
extremely
open
to
this
one
first
sip
is
smooth
creamy
malts
that
wash
across
the
tongue
great
complexity
here
now
as
well
rich
brown
ale
flavor
creamy
hints
of
earthy
tones
and
a
rich
subtly
dry
hop
presence
that
seems
to
build
and
build
last
sips
seem
to
be
equally
as
well
versed
in
sweet
caramel
notes
as
they
are
in
dry
piney
hops
super
session
able
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
oi
will
certainly
put
my
money
where
my
mouth
is
for
this
libation
it
is
bold
and
complex
in
every
way
despite
appearance
taste
is
essentially
the
biggest
concern
and
i
would
recommend
this
concoction
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
a
black
ipas
cheers
a
thick
blackish
brown
color
with
a
large
tan
head
and
lots
of
lace
to
go
around
the
aroma
brings
bright
lemon
and
swampy
malt
very
very
agreeable
the
flavor
brings
a
similar
taste
at
first
but
settles
to
steady
evergreen
malty
blend
its
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
but
plenty
drinkable
its
kind
of
glassy
in
feel
good
stuff
i
see
not
everyone
likes
this
but
i
may
be
unique
in
enjoying
that
swampyevergreen
combo
almost
resembles
a
peat
idea
that
i
just
find
agreeable
o
not
impressed
by
far
the
worst
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
the
color
is
not
even
black
and
carbonation
is
about
10
times
what
it
should
be
not
to
mention
it
tastes
bad
overall
not
particularly
good
but
different
and
worth
trying
o
very
drinkable
not
a
whole
lot
of
hops
for
a
black
ipa
not
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
would
recommend
trying
laughing
dog
is
generally
good
but
this
was
something
of
a
miss
not
terrible
but
like
a
decent
bmc
effort
overall
this
beer
is
okay
but
far
from
my
favorite
aba
not
sure
id
revisit
it
p
p
s
i
still
wont
ever
drink
this
beer
again
d
ive
had
far
better
bipas
but
i
coud
see
myself
drinking
this
again
overall
not
a
terrible
black
ipa
for
a
bomber
not
the
best
example
of
this
style
imho
stone
does
a
much
better
job
with
this
style
o
average
run
of
the
mill
black
ipa
looks
nice
but
is
this
feature
normal
or
just
the
result
of
a
possibly
infected
bottle
due
to
the
massive
over
carbonation
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
hidden
but
not
completely
absent
in
character
easy
drinking
for
the
most
part
but
one
and
done
was
enough
id
probably
pass
on
trying
it
again
in
the
future
unless
there
was
any
indication
of
freshness
this
looks
like
an
american
black
ale
black
ipa
but
it
is
lacking
in
flavor
and
aroma
my
first
black
ipa
pours
similar
to
a
porter
with
thick
white
head
aroma
is
pungently
grapefruit
the
taste
is
bitter
then
you
taste
the
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
creamy
overall
it
is
well
worth
the
57
dollars
spent
it
is
now
one
of
my
go
to
beers
since
ok
got
it
in
a
few
weeks
ago
dogzilla
pours
into
the
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
black
in
there
as
well
a
mix
of
the
two
leaning
towards
black
a
nice
loose
bubbled
dark
tan
foam
rose
up
and
retreated
after
some
minutes
okay
retention
weak
lacing
off
the
bat
this
does
not
smell
like
a
ipa
black
ale
is
a
good
term
for
this
beer
smells
grainy
roasty
with
some
small
storm
king
like
hop
scents
with
a
touch
of
the
6
9
coming
out
this
comes
off
like
a
hoppy
porter
with
some
tropics
of
a
ipa
without
exibiting
the
bitterness
of
one
feel
is
a
step
below
medium
with
a
nice
carb
but
goes
down
smooth
and
not
bitter
im
glad
i
split
the
bottle
because
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
a
black
ipa
whatever
that
is
d
its
a
solid
brew
not
really
getting
this
style
yet
but
there
are
some
ive
found
to
be
a
bit
more
put
together
while
its
a
beautiful
looking
beer
the
flavors
clash
a
bit
a
and
just
miss
the
mark
a
tad
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
and
im
not
usually
a
huge
black
ipa
guy
but
this
is
my
favorite
one
thus
far
it
smells
like
an
americano
and
its
dark
brown
with
a
red
hue
when
put
to
the
light
as
you
take
a
sip
you
get
hops
hard
then
it
mellows
into
the
nice
roasty
malt
and
finishes
bitter
with
both
hops
and
coffee
roast
nice
i
will
drink
this
again
nothing
overly
offnesive
here
but
nothing
that
jumps
up
and
becomes
remotely
reminiscent
of
this
one
either
you
do
or
you
dont
thats
about
it
pours
very
dark
nice
color
good
lingering
head
with
nice
lacing
unfortunately
thats
the
best
this
beer
has
to
offer
taste
is
thin
and
bitter
with
some
sour
notes
as
well
there
is
a
definite
hoppy
taste
but
not
enough
malt
to
offset
the
bitterness
not
my
cup
of
tea
and
i
would
not
purchase
again
theres
some
malty
sweetness
in
there
carbonation
normal
i
just
cant
get
over
the
flavor
of
this
beer
its
pretty
offensive
overall
a
very
easy
to
drink
ipa
hides
the
abv
extremely
well
this
beer
pour
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
trace
of
tan
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
with
grapefruit
hoppiness
the
taste
starts
with
that
strong
fruity
and
citrusy
hops
and
then
donates
with
some
malty
sweetness
the
overall
taste
impression
is
very
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
and
overcarbonated
overall
though
a
very
interesting
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
try
i
cant
seem
to
understand
why
this
is
rated
a
b
seems
quite
low
it
poured
black
with
a
good
amount
of
head
the
aroma
was
a
pleasant
amount
of
hop
aromas
their
was
something
off
about
the
taste
it
wasnt
that
hoppy
and
had
a
bit
of
a
buttery
diacetyl
taste
to
it
unfortunately
im
writing
this
off
of
notes
and
didnt
write
down
what
the
batch
number
or
anything
was
id
be
interested
to
see
what
this
is
supposed
to
taste
like
considering
the
fact
that
it
was
probably
a
bad
bottle
it
was
still
a
decent
beer
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
very
enjoyable
even
so
that
this
beer
is
not
my
favorite
beer
style
a
great
job
of
brewing
certainly
a
dark
beer
though
almost
more
of
a
porter
color
in
that
you
can
still
see
some
red
lurking
in
there
when
backlit
develops
a
onefinger
head
which
dies
away
but
leaves
some
lacing
smell
is
really
nice
very
american
hopforward
and
certainly
within
ipa
boundaries
sweet
juicy
hops
making
me
think
of
bubble
gum
and
citric
fruit
taste
is
intriguing
as
it
unfolds
the
beginning
has
a
sharp
hop
bite
followed
by
a
bit
of
soft
caramel
sweetness
though
not
much
and
the
finish
is
a
long
strong
bitterness
that
borders
on
astringent
there
are
a
lot
of
ibus
grinding
away
at
my
tongue
there
is
just
a
slight
roast
quality
to
it
but
not
a
lot
i
need
to
try
more
black
ipas
to
try
and
understand
their
purpose
if
there
is
one
the
body
is
about
right
and
thankfully
not
too
heavy
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
the
bittering
hops
are
too
heavyhanded
for
my
liking
otherwise
its
a
tasty
beer
and
a
pretty
good
deal
at
422
oz
bottle
hoppy
goodness
in
nose
and
mouth
very
dry
overall
a
nice
beer
well
above
average
first
sip
reveals
an
average
smooth
textured
body
with
tingly
but
gentle
rolling
carbonation
there
is
some
bread
notes
mixed
with
the
roast
malt
up
front
and
then
the
flavor
rolls
to
some
earthy
hops
no
hints
of
abv
anywhere
the
beer
is
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
will
buy
another
bottle
of
this
beer
in
the
future
the
near
future
surprised
this
one
doesnt
have
higher
numbers
i
loved
it
and
will
not
only
get
more
but
will
be
hunting
down
more
from
this
brewery
highly
recommended
while
this
beer
is
enjoyable
the
aroma
leads
more
towards
an
american
ipa
and
the
appearance
more
towards
an
imperial
ipa
the
flavor
seems
to
be
the
highlight
of
this
beer
for
me
and
overall
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
smells
of
slightly
floral
hops
and
old
lady
bad
perfume
great
head
and
nice
lacing
weird
bitterness
and
taste
of
perfume
with
bad
after
taste
not
impressed
wont
buy
again
or
recommend
to
anyone
worst
black
ipa
ive
had
the
only
thing
good
about
this
beer
is
the
head
not
even
black
far
from
great
dogzilla
is
also
far
from
poor
i
love
this
new
style
and
the
combination
of
black
ale
with
solid
hopping
is
up
my
alley
i
do
enjoy
the
beer
just
wish
it
was
a
little
more
refined
less
bitter
and
a
bit
chewier
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
it
has
the
beat
of
both
worlds
he
aging
mal
presence
of
a
stout
an
the
hops
of
an
ipa
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
no
highlights
showing
up
and
a
thick
tan
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
and
retains
well
the
aroma
is
bursting
with
fresh
hop
notes
grapefruit
pine
orange
zest
along
with
some
cocoa
dark
chocolate
coffee
burnt
bread
dark
fruits
and
some
alcohol
very
nice
and
complex
the
flavor
is
similar
with
big
citrusy
and
piney
hop
notes
upfront
along
with
some
cocoa
and
orange
zest
burnt
bread
and
espresso
dark
fruits
a
slight
chalkiness
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
maybe
a
tad
thin
for
my
liking
but
drinkability
is
good
pretty
tasty
black
ipa
not
mindblowing
but
sufficiently
complex
and
satisfying
pours
a
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
head
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
relentlessly
smells
of
freshly
cut
grass
taste
is
herbal
grassiness
up
front
with
a
dark
caramel
middle
and
a
bitter
grapefruit
rind
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
brutal
bitterness
in
a
good
way
that
gives
you
your
hop
fix
22oz
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
frothy
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
piney
hops
roasted
malts
and
a
small
amount
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
mostly
pine
with
mocha
a
bit
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
decent
black
ipa
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
would
i
buy
it
again
only
if
there
werent
so
many
above
average
ipas
available
why
go
for
safe
on
first
when
you
are
capable
of
hitting
a
home
run
d
this
wasnt
a
terrible
beer
but
it
seemed
as
though
they
tried
to
go
4
directions
with
one
beer
to
the
point
that
it
was
just
not
quite
as
good
as
it
could
have
been
my
local
beer
store
had
a
bunch
of
laughing
dog
in
stock
so
i
picked
up
several
including
dogzilla
pours
a
deep
dark
reddish
brown
not
truly
a
black
ipa
to
me
this
would
be
what
i
would
call
a
cascadian
dark
ale
though
that
style
name
is
somewhat
pretentious
this
beer
is
pretty
to
look
at
with
a
billowing
and
sticky
two
finger
light
tan
head
with
lacing
clinging
to
the
glass
massive
hop
aroma
hits
the
nose
first
with
loads
of
pine
and
grass
up
front
malt
aroma
there
as
well
somewhat
crackery
though
faint
mouthfeel
is
mildly
carbonated
and
a
little
bit
thin
you
dont
have
time
to
really
notice
this
though
as
tons
and
tons
of
fresh
hop
flavor
hijack
the
taste
this
is
clearly
a
west
coast
style
brew
right
up
there
with
the
big
boys
in
terms
of
hop
presence
atypical
to
style
the
taste
is
fleeting
rather
than
slamming
the
tongue
with
waves
of
lingering
bitterness
the
brew
instead
finishes
very
dry
with
crackery
malt
hitting
all
the
right
notes
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
take
on
the
cda
black
ipa
iba
style
as
the
mild
bitterness
and
great
hop
character
makes
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
ive
yet
to
see
a
black
ipa
live
up
to
the
hype
this
one
is
a
good
ipa
but
it
might
as
well
be
pale
not
that
i
dont
like
this
beer
because
it
is
good
theres
just
nothing
that
stands
out
other
than
the
color
from
any
other
ipa
i
would
buy
it
again
my
first
laughing
dog
beer
they
have
my
attention
but
this
one
doesnt
really
hold
up
by
ipa
standards
in
a
way
this
is
average
beer
but
in
a
way
it
just
doesnt
hold
up
a
light
score
decrease
on
price
6
for
a
22
oz
and
style
considerations
ipas
are
great
even
if
theyre
crap
i
did
a
blind
taste
test
with
another
unnamed
black
ipa
and
this
one
lost
dm
nice
crisp
carbonation
with
a
good
overall
flavor
that
coats
the
palate
really
strong
sipping
beer
that
does
not
meld
with
the
style
as
i
expected
i
wanted
more
weight
to
the
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
pretty
nice
and
tasty
beer
doesnt
seem
to
fit
really
well
in
the
black
ipa
category
though
needs
more
dark
malt
and
hops
flavors
and
some
more
body
to
be
better
drinkability
is
out
of
this
world
light
enough
to
be
a
drank
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
rich
enough
to
warm
you
on
a
cold
winter
night
this
might
not
pack
the
punch
of
stones
ssr
but
this
is
the
blows
away
boulders
flashback
which
i
loved
d
was
expecting
more
from
this
beer
but
it
failed
to
live
up
to
expectations
perhaps
i
bought
a
bad
bottle
maybe
down
the
road
will
try
it
again
highly
drinkable
for
such
great
flavor
alone
thought
the
abv
is
definitely
going
to
catch
up
with
you
at
some
point
until
the
very
last
drop
dogzilla
is
a
smashingly
good
beer
finally
a
reason
to
visit
idaho
a
really
good
shot
at
the
style
not
world
class
but
certainly
worth
ordering
a
few
dark
brown
middle
with
cherry
red
edges
a
small
dirty
white
head
recedes
quickly
a
rumbling
of
lace
sticks
randomly
smells
of
oily
hops
with
a
fleeting
sweet
malt
undercurrent
tastes
grainy
with
more
huge
oily
hops
and
a
perfect
sweetness
in
the
end
again
which
balances
everything
out
saving
the
day
medium
mouthfeel
and
highly
drinkable
i
havent
been
able
to
get
to
this
style
lately
but
this
particular
beer
gets
me
one
step
closer
to
acceptance
poured
into
a
tulip
the
color
is
a
dark
brown
coming
close
to
black
the
aroma
brings
some
really
nice
pine
and
citrus
along
with
some
roasted
malt
fairly
common
for
the
style
and
right
within
the
parameters
of
what
i
would
expect
good
taste
with
a
bit
of
roast
though
the
hops
arent
quite
on
the
level
as
the
nose
roast
and
bitterness
in
the
feel
a
nice
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
more
from
them
i
think
this
bottle
was
mildly
infected
it
still
pulled
through
rather
well
though
pours
very
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
half
inch
of
foamy
head
that
laces
the
glass
the
aroma
is
malty
slightly
smoky
with
some
aromatic
hops
adding
a
sour
zest
the
flavor
is
of
very
dark
roasted
malt
coffee
and
a
hint
of
smokiness
with
a
bracingly
bitter
finish
pours
deep
dark
brown
with
tan
head
very
nice
lacing
lingers
all
the
way
to
the
last
sip
nose
is
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
of
burnt
toast
caramel
and
charcoal
followed
by
earthy
hoppy
bitterness
the
bitterness
remains
in
your
mouth
for
several
minutes
after
each
sip
the
body
is
bit
full
for
the
style
but
overall
a
decent
cda
this
was
my
first
black
ipa
and
although
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
style
does
not
seem
unique
enough
to
draw
me
in
i
will
try
other
examples
and
hope
for
more
inspiration
notes
excited
to
try
this
as
it
is
my
first
black
ipa
but
i
was
a
bit
underwhelmed
im
not
sure
if
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
or
just
this
beer
but
it
just
didnt
really
work
for
me
both
the
hops
and
malt
came
out
but
neither
is
really
strong
or
enjoyable
hops
provided
mostly
a
bitterness
not
as
much
nice
hoppy
flavors
probably
not
worth
the
price
although
again
i
might
just
not
enjoy
the
style
as
much
hearty
drinker
rich
full
of
flavor
solid
d
the
entire
bomber
went
down
easy
enough
but
i
dont
think
im
rushing
out
for
another
anytime
soon
hope
to
find
a
clean
bottle
in
the
future
so
i
can
do
a
proper
review
of
the
beer
and
not
the
infection
mild
carbonation
excellent
mouth
feel
creamy
and
rich
alcohol
is
nonexistent
to
the
senses
maybe
after
you
finish
it
another
after
1
maybe
a
great
beer
to
settle
with
though
with
the
bold
flavors
would
be
hard
to
pair
with
a
meal
better
as
a
stand
alone
or
with
some
rich
desserts
it
was
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
id
buy
again
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
i
would
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
complexity
like
i
said
earlier
just
reminds
me
of
a
guinness
with
some
piney
hops
id
rather
stick
to
a
standard
stout
or
a
standard
ipa
i
dont
remember
having
had
a
black
ipa
before
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
with
some
dark
stuff
thrown
in
if
thats
not
obvious
pretty
good
twist
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
i
could
see
this
being
a
regular
brew
d
this
stuff
is
delicious
and
the
higher
abv
is
nicely
hidden
a
very
tasty
dominant
hop
presence
which
is
nicely
complemented
by
the
malts
a
must
try
for
any
hop
lover
and
i
would
definitely
indulge
again
theres
nothing
about
this
beer
that
makes
it
hard
to
drink
but
theres
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
others
in
the
category
the
pour
was
jet
black
with
a
ridiculous
amount
of
head
about
23
fo
the
glsass
the
2nd
pour
only
slightly
better
pine
and
sweet
citrus
on
the
nose
the
flavor
has
pine
resin
oranges
and
a
little
grapefruit
and
a
light
finish
solid
medium
body
averrage
carbonation
i
knocked
the
drinkability
because
i
had
to
wait
10
minutes
to
drink
it
because
of
the
head
a
decent
black
ipa
but
there
are
better
ones
d
extremely
drinkable
i
think
my
22
oz
bottle
was
missing
a
few
ozs
it
went
so
fast
thanks
again
toby
i
dont
think
i
can
say
that
enough
strong
aroma
is
like
freshly
baked
rye
bread
with
an
undertone
of
yeast
and
just
a
hint
of
citrus
it
pours
a
clear
dark
mahogany
with
a
thick
fluffy
fairly
persistent
pale
tan
head
flavor
is
more
ryelike
and
yeasty
than
hoppy
rather
bitter
hint
of
grapefruit
texture
is
smooth
as
soymilk
and
just
a
little
bit
tingly
leaving
behind
a
sharp
slightly
bitter
rye
finish
ok
but
i
have
had
better
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
worth
a
purchase
for
sure
the
real
question
is
is
this
a
beer
to
seek
out
and
spend
your
hard
earned
money
on
may
answer
is
yes
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
black
ipa
well
balanced
with
enough
hop
flavor
for
hopheads
but
not
so
much
that
you
hit
over
the
head
with
it
overall
this
is
a
well
carted
example
of
a
black
ipa
big
ups
to
johngalt1
for
this
choice
huge
ipa
fan
not
so
much
on
the
black
ipa
but
this
is
legit
and
kind
of
changed
me
deep
burnt
caramel
pour
sweet
malty
smell
i
liked
this
because
it
was
a
nice
balance
for
a
change
some
of
the
new
black
ipas
are
too
dominated
by
the
malty
sweetness
this
doe
not
have
that
you
actually
get
some
pinet
hop
notes
clean
crisp
hops
sweet
malt
backbone
to
add
to
the
drinkability
good
stuff
d
overall
i
really
dig
black
ipas
and
this
one
is
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
an
interesting
style
and
fairly
sessionable
good
but
not
near
the
best
in
its
class
needs
to
be
slightly
more
balanced
normally
i
like
acridity
especially
from
smoke
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
work
here
a
fan
of
laughing
dogs
approach
and
will
continue
to
support
them
and
hopefully
their
offerings
can
jump
to
the
next
level
not
sure
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
was
not
a
very
well
balanced
beer
the
head
was
a
pain
i
do
not
feel
like
waiting
10
minutes
for
the
head
to
dissipate
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
of
brown
head
and
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
saticking
to
the
glass
the
nose
was
like
a
regular
which
was
grapefruit
citrus
pine
and
floral
hops
but
it
had
a
big
roasted
malt
character
the
flavors
were
like
the
nose
consisting
of
a
piney
hop
bite
alongside
citrus
grapefruit
that
help
out
on
the
overall
bitterness
but
the
roastes
malts
to
add
some
dimension
to
this
ipa
styled
beer
quite
intresting
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
roasty
citric
and
bitter
finish
it
drank
pretty
good
and
im
really
digging
this
experimental
style
that
other
brewers
should
take
on
to
make
beer
that
much
more
intresting
overall
not
a
bad
beer
to
try
but
for
7
99
i
do
not
anticipate
buying
again
drinkability
my
first
lauhging
dog
is
a
success
i
would
buy
this
again
unsure
why
its
only
rated
a
b
like
many
other
laughing
dog
products
the
basic
recipe
seems
fine
but
the
infections
from
tannin
extractions
and
polyphenols
is
just
too
much
to
overlook
this
is
one
of
the
earliest
examples
of
the
black
ipa
style
that
i
can
remember
seeing
in
bottles
and
while
it
could
use
some
more
balancing
dark
malt
character
to
help
offset
the
hops
this
was
still
pretty
darn
solid
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
from
laughing
dog
d
this
is
a
nice
ipa
with
full
good
depth
of
hops
and
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
it
has
an
interesting
twist
with
the
black
malt
qualities
being
more
sweaty
astringent
but
in
a
pleasant
way
and
not
the
fullness
of
black
malt
you
get
in
a
stout
or
porter
pretty
decent
still
not
an
ssra
but
still
good
great
full
bodied
mouthfeel
tons
of
carbonation
very
very
good
beer
pours
a
dark
brownishred
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
with
a
lot
of
toffee
malt
piney
hops
and
some
iced
tea
notes
the
flavor
is
pine
and
roasted
malts
with
some
resiny
hops
earthy
hops
and
surprisingly
something
that
resembles
tea
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
good
but
not
among
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
tried
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
id
be
okay
with
this
as
a
light
colored
ipa
overall
not
going
to
buy
this
one
again
but
it
might
be
for
some
a
this
bottle
had
to
be
infected
ive
read
other
positive
reviews
so
this
must
be
an
aberration
i
will
give
it
another
chance
and
buy
a
bottle
with
fingers
crossed
taste
improved
after
the
beer
aired
started
out
very
charcoal
and
bitter
this
mellowed
a
bit
after
the
drink
continued
the
bitterness
stayed
in
my
mouth
and
was
very
strong
the
beer
had
just
a
little
bit
of
a
watery
mouth
feel
the
bitterness
held
down
the
drinkability
as
well
pours
a
dark
brown
color
but
not
black
as
the
style
suggests
it
has
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
with
big
bubbles
the
smell
was
citrusy
and
floral
as
you
would
expect
from
an
ipa
the
surprise
came
from
the
taste
which
felt
like
i
was
sucking
on
hard
candy
there
was
no
roastyness
as
would
be
expected
from
the
color
this
one
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
and
i
liked
it
it
was
my
first
foray
into
the
realm
of
cascadian
dark
ales
yeah
i
like
that
term
better
than
black
ipa
and
i
will
defiantly
seek
out
more
of
this
style
to
get
a
better
feel
for
it
enjoyed
at
the
oregon
brewers
festival
2010
pours
a
light
brown
colour
with
offwhite
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
with
littletono
lacing
this
bottle
must
be
infected
but
it
was
recently
purchased
i
was
told
it
had
almost
a
smellflavour
of
a
bad
white
wine
mostly
sour
grapes
not
getting
roasted
malt
or
a
hop
bite
that
id
expect
from
a
black
ipa
drinkability
unsubtle
but
flavorful
this
beer
has
some
gotcha
and
it
plays
its
cards
well
i
would
have
this
again
i
wasnt
all
that
impressed
with
this
one
ill
be
interested
in
trying
a
different
brewerys
black
ipa
to
see
if
it
tastes
any
better
or
if
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
style
paired
with
something
meaty
this
would
be
a
repeat
on
my
lineup
big
white
soapy
head
mollasses
and
hops
simcoe
some
roasted
malt
infected
buttery
mouthfeelsome
malts
hops
did
not
work
weak
carbonation
frehly
purchased
bottle
by
rk
certainly
not
his
fault
not
finishable
thanks
to
hopflop
for
this
one
served
from
bottle
into
a
stone
nonic
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
three
finger
off
white
head
that
is
very
frothy
but
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
hops
and
malt
the
flavor
was
of
dark
malt
and
hops
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
ipa
the
head
retention
was
epic
on
this
one
just
glad
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
definitely
on
par
for
this
style
and
it
was
one
of
the
top
black
ipas
ive
tried
to
date
pretty
carbonated
but
complex
this
is
also
not
that
thick
medium
in
body
but
highly
drinkable
pours
dark
brown
with
a
huge
tan
head
nose
is
hoppy
but
the
burnt
malts
also
show
up
as
the
beer
warms
up
not
a
huge
beer
in
flavour
but
rather
a
slightly
mellow
cascadian
ipa
the
beer
actually
has
a
bitterness
in
the
finish
that
grows
tiresome
as
the
bottle
progreses
i
poured
out
the
last
half
glass
becuase
of
this
note
i
have
had
better
versions
of
this
style
and
will
not
purchase
this
again
the
beer
seems
a
little
over
carbonated
and
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
a
little
dry
but
it
does
not
distract
too
much
from
the
taste
of
the
beer
good
for
an
ipa
but
darker
than
normal
decent
head
and
appearance
but
the
taste
is
not
likely
to
please
most
american
ipa
fans
smell
and
taste
evoke
a
christmas
beer
cloves
and
minty
pine
next
yuletide
ill
buy
some
schlaflys
but
for
summertime
hops
ill
look
elsewhere
not
recommended
for
ipa
lovers
overall
this
was
my
first
of
this
style
i
hope
it
gets
beeter
after
this
so
far
black
ipas
are
0
for
one
in
my
book
interesting
black
ipa
but
lacking
in
a
few
standard
ipa
qualities
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
picking
up
for
any
ipa
fan
drinkability
i
could
have
this
again
this
is
an
interesting
beer
with
the
chocolate
and
hops
almost
like
a
hopped
up
schwarzbier
good
above
average
ipa
notes
this
is
quite
a
beast
it
might
appear
to
be
cute
and
cuddly
but
that
is
only
an
illusion
inot
the
dark
heart
of
this
beer
i
am
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
this
one
and
will
get
more
cheers
something
is
odd
about
this
brew
i
like
it
but
between
the
caramel
in
the
nose
and
the
vanilla
sweetness
in
the
taste
you
can
easily
forget
this
is
an
ipa
this
beer
poured
a
clear
deep
redbrown
color
with
tall
creamy
light
brown
foam
that
persisted
the
smell
was
nw
hops
though
not
very
prominent
the
taste
was
hoppy
but
also
malty
like
a
very
hoppy
dunkel
or
schwarzbier
not
overly
sweet
but
a
tad
more
sweet
than
an
ipa
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
hoppy
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
good
dark
malt
throughout
and
a
hoppy
finish
this
was
a
nice
beer
good
overall
across
the
board
actually
not
exceptional
but
not
bad
really
as
i
try
to
drink
some
more
i
realize
ive
only
had
a
few
ounces
and
cant
fathom
even
pouring
the
rest
from
the
bottle
yeah
this
is
a
drain
pour
light
carbonation
full
bodied
a
nice
ipa
to
take
your
time
drinking
overall
it
was
good
probably
enjoy
alpha
dog
more
though
overall
mix
a
porter
with
an
ipa
you
get
this
beer
im
not
sure
what
to
call
it
but
i
know
i
like
it
notes
maybe
this
is
an
off
bottle
although
i
doubt
it
and
even
if
it
were
it
was
a
rather
pleasing
drink
thing
is
that
it
has
great
funky
sense
not
a
skunked
one
mind
you
but
something
more
in
line
with
the
way
that
brettanomyces
feels
in
a
subtle
way
the
nose
and
look
support
that
feel
and
make
for
a
nice
dark
ipa
with
a
fresh
hoppy
funk
that
does
the
trick
very
well
did
they
bottle
something
else
on
this
one
laughing
dogs
dogzilla
is
one
of
those
beers
that
tries
to
be
different
while
ending
up
the
same
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
thick
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
tan
lace
smell
is
of
sweet
bread
and
bubblegum
nothing
unique
about
the
taste
except
for
a
lingering
bitterness
that
is
almost
unpleasant
drinkability
is
scored
as
average
because
of
this
one
and
done
d
good
ipa
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
easily
drinkable
d
i
hope
there
wasnt
a
reason
this
was
discounted
from
7
99
to
3
99
at
the
only
store
i
know
of
in
wi
that
sells
it
i
will
have
to
get
another
to
see
if
this
one
was
infected
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
again
overall
a
very
nice
beer
that
ill
certainly
try
again
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
black
ipa
style
facet
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
if
you
want
a
slight
variant
of
a
normal
ipa
no
freshness
date
on
this
bomber
i
hope
this
one
isnt
too
rough
on
the
guts
tomorrow
would
recommend
this
beer
to
ipa
fans
and
other
beer
lovers
i
found
it
to
be
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
also
very
well
balanced
drinkability
i
mean
not
too
exciting
here
its
got
more
flavor
than
a
pale
ale
might
but
the
flavors
dont
feel
synergistic
or
add
much
to
one
another
just
a
bit
underwhelming
appearance
is
pretty
dark
with
a
nice
head
and
fair
lace
smell
has
a
nice
balance
of
hop
and
roasted
malt
with
some
grapefruit
taste
has
a
big
punch
of
dark
roasted
malts
and
a
little
salinity
with
a
good
bite
of
grapefruit
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
little
roasty
for
my
taste
but
overall
not
a
bad
beer
flavors
of
roasted
dark
malt
cocoa
and
coffee
paired
with
bright
citrusy
and
piney
hops
hints
of
smoke
and
oak
flavors
move
in
and
out
working
well
together
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
satisfying
and
tasty
ill
definitely
buy
this
one
again
this
is
a
good
ipa
the
chocolatey
appearance
doesnt
add
much
of
anything
but
novelty
the
pour
is
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
a
modest
white
head
that
retreats
quickly
leaving
a
moderate
lace
the
hops
and
malts
dont
exactly
explode
into
the
nose
but
they
are
there
they
are
consistent
and
they
are
nice
the
nose
is
a
bit
boozy
with
some
sweetness
via
the
malts
this
ipa
has
a
nice
combination
of
malt
and
hop
not
too
much
of
either
just
a
nice
fruity
bitterness
with
a
toasty
sweetness
that
coexist
quite
nicely
there
was
a
lot
of
hype
surrounding
this
style
and
the
dark
malt
does
add
a
nice
toastiness
to
the
beer
but
it
is
nothing
to
really
write
home
about
the
beer
is
good
and
the
hype
is
hype
the
feel
throws
this
off
this
is
second
brew
from
this
brewery
that
has
a
carbonation
issue
that
throws
it
off
another
had
a
hint
of
it
and
a
few
others
were
fine
despite
this
it
is
an
interesting
beer
with
bitterness
coming
from
hops
and
roast
check
this
beer
out
if
you
can
on
tap
ive
had
bottles
i
wasnt
nearly
as
impressed
with
you
just
dont
seem
to
get
the
simcoe
and
cascade
hop
assault
not
nearly
as
complete
without
all
that
pine
and
citrus
hop
mouthfeel
medium
body
with
a
pungent
aftertaste
the
way
this
beer
lingers
in
my
mouth
costs
it
some
drinkablity
points
other
than
that
great
beer
hope
i
can
acquire
another
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
odd
yet
pleasant
flavors
play
nicely
off
one
another
i
could
sit
with
this
for
a
bit
overall
a
solid
beer
dark
but
light
mouthfeel
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
3
14
tan
head
over
the
clear
reddish
brown
brew
head
lasts
more
or
less
forever
with
heavy
coating
lace
aroma
is
sweet
and
citrusy
taste
is
rich
and
sweet
upfront
piney
citrus
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
ample
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
nice
brew
poured
great
more
of
a
darker
brown
than
black
tasted
good
while
drinking
but
the
bitterness
lingered
stopping
this
beer
from
competing
with
the
better
beers
love
the
idea
of
ipastout
hybrids
and
think
laughing
dog
is
headed
in
the
right
direction
just
too
much
for
me
without
a
bit
of
sweet
to
save
it
i
didnt
want
to
finish
it
very
bitter
dry
piney
hops
up
front
that
are
quickly
countered
by
a
very
strong
buttery
toffee
presence
there
is
a
strong
dark
caramel
and
chocolate
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
dark
fruit
mostly
sour
cherries
and
dark
berries
it
really
does
taste
like
a
very
biter
chocolate
covered
chrry
very
odd
and
unpleasant
combination
of
flavors
the
bitterness
lingers
thorughout
but
the
strange
malt
backbone
is
very
rominent
and
the
whole
beer
is
a
bit
of
a
mess
not
a
fan
d
high
for
the
style
great
black
ipa
overall
these
laughing
dog
guys
are
solid
really
cant
believe
this
is
rated
b
overall
22
oz
bottle
served
in
a
duvel
tulip
opened
with
a
big
pop
lots
of
carbonation
poured

with
a
huge
head
of
light
tan
foam
citrusy
hop

more
citrus
and
piney

in
the

plenty
of

bitterness
some
chocolate

nice

glass
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
didnt
really
take
anything
away
from
the
beer
finished
with
malt
dryness
along
with
drying
hops
nice
black
ipa
works
for
me
interesting
d
not
on
my
watch
not
recommended
to
anyone
except
serious
devout
hopheads
even
then
oh
well
they
get
an
a
for
creativity
which
should
be
a
category
mouthfeel
has
a
slickness
to
it
with
a
fluffy
texture
this
one
is
hard
to
categorize
its
not
following
rules
is
it
a
dark
ipa
or
an
overhopped
porter
either
way
you
will
experience
something
outside
the
comfort
zone
and
it
is
still
very
good
if
you
have
an
open
mind
seek
this
out
and
try
something
totally
different
from
the
usual
fair
drinkability
overall
it
was
a
very
good
dry
and
bitter
ipa
that
was
weak
in
the
nose
but
had
a
nice
bitter
taste
with
black
toasted
malts
backing
it
up
if
you
ever
want
to
try
a
beer
from
idaho
thats
bitter
and
dry
with
a
unique
color
then
pick
up
a
bottle
of
dogzilla
this
beer
shouldnt
burn
a
hole
in
your
wallet
pretty
decent
i
love
black
ipas
so
kudos
to
all
that
make
one
has
a
good
flavor
that
i
never
really
got
bored
with
i
like
this
and
will
try
again
i
cant
say
that
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
a
rough
mix
of
irish
stout
and
ipa
which
is
not
as
satisfying
as
either
on
its
own
like
most
premix
black
and
tans
a
black
ipa
maybe
a
good
idea
but
this
take
needs
work
stick
with
alpha
dog
or
devil
dog
overall
this
isnt
bad
bit
too
much
towards
a
porter
though
for
me
for
me
a
black
ipa
should
be
more
like
a
dark
lager
but
an
ale
and
with
a
larger
hop
profile
which
after
belching
there
is
a
nice
flood
of
hops
citrus
even
and
is
a
bit
hidden
by
the
overdone
porterlike
malting
blanced
almost
very
deep
reddish
auburn
colour
clear
with
great
head
retention
there
were
thick
rings
of
whitish
lace
denoting
each
sip
intense
aroma
of
orange
tangerine
and
grapefruit
not
much
else
moderate
bitterness
up
front
that
grew
into
the
finish
caramel
sweetness
with
a
bit
of
toffee
fruity
tangelo
grapefruit
towards
the
end
and
a
lingering
bitter
orange
finish
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
some
dryness
decent
texture
overall
not
bad
at
all
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
drinkability
is
good
if
you
have
time
to
wait
for
the
head
to
die
down
drinkability
is
good
but
nothing
special
really
just
an
ipa
with
some
lightly
roasted
malts
thrown
in
22
oz
bomber
dark
brown
with
a
huge
light
tan
creamy
head
aroma
to
me
was
very
subdued
and
unimpressive
some
maltyiness
and
the
barest
hint
of
pine
taste
weird
this
is
my
first
black
ipa
and
certainlly
its
almost
a
balance
between
the
malts
a
toastytoffeeish
and
the
hopping
mainlly
piney
takes
some
getting
used
to
nice
mouthfeel
on
this
one
overall
a
very
different
ipa
like
i
said
my
first
black
ipa
need
to
try
some
more
drinkability
low
i
couldnt
get
over
the
tire
flavor
which
is
a
shame
because
every
other
aspect
of
the
beer
was
delightful
a
excessive
foam
on
an
easy
pour
a
full
four
inches
to
one
inch
of
beer
though
it
dropped
within
a
few
minutes
leaving
a
slight
rocky
head
the
color
of
a
cola
some
sticky
patches
along
the
edge
of
the
glass
2
50
s
mild
sweetness
in
the
back
of
the
nose
noticeable
espresso
and
ash
a
little
vegetal
hard
to
decipher
or
identify
the
hops
which
seems
meek
2
25
t
the
palate
is
considerably
better
than
the
nose
led
me
to
expect
significant
hop
bitterness
but
mild
for
the
style
some
grapefruit
and
orange
rind
also
some
coffee
ground
flavors
2
75
m
slightly
gritty
and
smooth
3
00
d
i
appreciate
the
concept
of
an
ipa
with
dark
specialty
malts
but
the
ipa
side
of
the
beer
is
seriously
lacking
in
my
opinion
theres
a
fair
share
of
bitterness
but
none
of
the
other
pleasantries
associated
with
hops
though
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
i
dont
foresee
buying
this
beer
again
3
00
d
still
trying
to
figure
out
this
style
a
good
and
reasonably
drinkable
version
of
a
style
my
taste
buds
consistently
protest
worth
a
try
be
your
own
judge
but
still
the
same
drinkability
or
lack
there
of
ive
often
found
overall
i
like
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
its
very
bubble
which
is
good
for
a
virginia
evening
as
far
as
these
style
go
i
will
take
an
iniquity
or
a
stone
black
ipa
over
this
one
im
new
to
the
style
and
while
this
beer
looks
and
smells
great
it
doesnt
deliver
on
flavor
which
as
we
all
know
is
king
this
poured
a
clear
very
dark
mahogany
with
tons
and
tons
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
juicy
oranges
and
copper
hops
with
some
roasted
barley
and
a
bit
of
coffee
it
tasted
like
strong
coffee
with
some
copper
and
cream
and
roasted
barley
it
was
watery
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
overall
i
love
this
style
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
particular
example
it
still
had
a
pretty
good
smell
and
taste
with
decent
body
but
simply
pouring
it
was
a
nuisance
due
to
all
the
head
and
the
lasting
metallic
flavor
makes
this
a
bit
tough
to
drink
i
miss
the
clean
and
succulent
character
of
iniquity
or
sublimely
selfrighteous
dogzilla
just
didnt
impress
me
its
drinkable
and
a
very
good
beer
but
too
roasty
for
style
maybe
black
ipa
needs
its
own
category
as
i
suspect
this
happens
a
lot
overall
this
was
interesting
but
im
not
sure
i
would
get
this
again
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
think
its
drinkability
is
hurt
by
the
fact
that
it
purports
to
be
an
ipa
but
is
more
of
a
style
of
its
own
dogzilla
black
did
not
work
at
the
end
of
a
warm
summer
day
and
as
ipas
go
its
just
plain
wrong
d
decent
drinkability
the
dark
malt
base
and
bitterness
go
well
together
but
wish
the
hops
were
brighter
and
sharper
in
pronunciation
worth
a
grab
if
you
see
it
but
dont
expect
the
hoppiness
to
win
you
over
here
from
a
22
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
hazy
red
with
fairly
fat
tan
long
lasting
head
very
sticky
lacing
rings
the
nose
is
lightly
roasted
malts
with
floral
and
citrus
hops
thick
and
cream
palate
with
a
slick
mouthfeel
lots
of
rich
flavor
with
a
good
balance
between
the
sweet
malts
and
hop
bitterness
leading
to
a
slight
bitter
d
an
intriguing
beer
but
done
much
less
well
than
iniquity
from
southern
tier
and
it
suffers
for
it
pours
a
very
deep
dark
reddishbrown
and
edging
that
glows
with
a
creamy
tan
colored
head
that
lasts
for
sometime
and
remains
a
layer
atop
the
glass
the
aroma
has
sweet
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
some
fruity
hops
although
faint
the
flavor
has
much
of
the
same
although
more
sweetness
and
has
a
nice
soft
bitter
finish
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
plenty
carbonated
and
has
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
found
it
to
be
a
more
balanced
black
ipa
than
most
others
i
have
tried
pretty
good
it
has
a
soft
smokiness
that
becomes
present
as
the
beer
the
warms
up
another
typical
black
ale
although
they
call
it
an
black
ipa
which
makes
no
sense
anyway
dark
roasty
malts
sit
under
some
pretty
sharp
citrusy
hop
flavors
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
laughing
dog
recommended
the
taste
is
just
awful
i
couldnt
get
it
out
of
my
mouth
fast
enough
but
it
was
at
least
fast
enough
that
i
didnt
have
to
figure
out
what
it
was
that
i
was
tasting
i
immediately
walked
downstairs
and
poured
it
out
i
was
afraid
that
i
might
spill
some
on
my
clothes
and
ruin
them
forever
i
dont
understand
how
any
brewer
can
bottle
this
and
sell
it
dont
they
ever
taste
the
beer
they
make
the
first
time
this
was
reviewed
was
8208
so
if
it
has
only
been
brewed
the
one
time
then
this
is
10
months
old
i
cant
think
of
a
better
reason
why
all
beer
should
have
the
bottling
date
on
it
how
could
i
possibly
know
that
this
is
8
months
past
when
i
should
have
bought
it
if
this
is
true
i
will
rate
it
because
i
dont
know
when
it
was
brewed
i
would
rather
drink
10000
bud
lights
than
one
of
these
a
new
brewery
at
my
usual
source
whole
foods
market
in
nova
they
also
has
there
alpha
dog
and
the
csd
m
light
mild
drinkability
this
black
ipa
did
not
do
it
for
me
at
all
as
the
bitterness
level
was
lower
than
expected
allowing
the
sweetness
to
rise
to
the
top
overall
solid
tasty
ipa
another
good
ld
beer
d
i
like
black
coffee
so
its
not
bad
but
definitely
not
what
i
expected
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
this
one
again
but
it
was
worth
the
try
if
you
like
black
lagers
or
fruity
stouts
id
say
go
for
it
as
far
as
ipas
go
alpha
dog
blows
it
away
overall
this
is
a
bit
strange
for
an
ipa
and
no
where
near
as
good
as
other
black
ipas
ive
sampled
such
as
the
stone
11th
anniversary
brew
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
this
and
would
not
have
it
again
in
my
rr
tulip
this
beer
is
a
gorgeous
brown
with
ruby
highlights
a
thick
fine
lattecolored
head
and
some
breathtaking
lacework
on
the
nose
theres
citrus
hops
with
orange
and
lemon
with
a
creamy
chocolate
character
decent
on
the
palate
it
opens
up
with
a
harsh
hop
bitterness
citrus
with
grapefruit
and
lime
zest
providing
the
foundation
theres
muted
malt
flavors
with
a
milt
sweetness
present
the
milky
character
i
noticed
on
the
nose
is
missing
and
theres
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
but
the
hops
just
cover
it
all
up
there
isnt
enough
balance
between
the
flavor
and
bittering
hops
carbonation
is
good
but
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
higher
than
id
like
and
rather
unbalanced
the
finish
otoh
is
good
with
a
pleasant
dryness
and
a
mild
bitterness
again
the
lack
of
balance
hurts
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
m
medium
bodied
carbonation
level
is
a
litle
high
very
crisp
and
slightly
muddy
pours
a
clear
brown
with
red
highlights
this
beer
is
certainly
not
black
smells
of
west
coast
hops
and
not
much
else
first
sip
is
grapefruit
hops
the
massive
hops
easily
dominate
the
malts
to
a
point
of
being
too
unbalanced
very
bitter
from
start
to
finish
this
is
quite
good
in
a
west
coast
ipa
sort
of
way
drinkability
the
more
of
this
i
drink
the
more
im
thinking
this
is
infected
ive
had
infected
brews
before
usually
my
own
homebrews
but
nothing
this
light
its
just
got
a
sourtartness
that
is
out
of
place
and
the
carbonation
is
obviously
a
bit
much
oh
wells
win
some
ya
lose
some
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
because
it
had
the
hop
of
an
ipa
and
carried
the
taste
of
a
stout
as
well
im
not
a
big
fan
of
stouts
but
i
enjoy
the
flavor
here
you
get
that
flavor
in
a
lighter
ipa
style
d
worth
a
try
i
guess
helps
increase
the
palate
of
flavors
on
the
tongue
i
pass
on
this
one
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights

a

persists
forever
and
leaves

of
floral

pine
some
brown

is
fairly

bitter

with
a

of

in
there
slight

very
faint
this
one
is
mostly
hops
i
pick
up
a
faint
spicy
belgian
yeast
character
in
the
finish
of
this
one
body
is
medium
to
thin
mouthfeel
is
sticky
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
this
one
is
only
ok
the
body
is
too
thin
theres
an
off
putting
astringent
taste
the
carbonation
is
much
to
high
i
like
what
they
were
trying
to
do
but
this
is
one
and
done
for
me
its
okay
but
i
wouldnt
go
looking
for
it
again
overall
im
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
for
a
black
ipa
it
seems
to
be
missing
the
ipa
part
its
just
a
mess
try
if
you
like
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
well
at
least
it
looked
good
poured
black
with
a
large
light
tan
head
aroma
was
bad
and
the
taste
was
even
worse
sour
in
a
bad
way
plastic
mild
vomit
i
would
have
not
even
rated
it
if
i
thought
this
was
an
isolated
case
but
by
looking
at
some
of
the
other
ratings
i
am
sure
there
is
a
problem
with
this
beer
in
general
down
the
drain
what
a
shame
d
but
i
cant
bring
myself
to
finish
it
just
shy
of
a
drain
pour
purchased
liquid
solutions
dont
know
how
long
i
could
drink
this
one
i
really
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
at
all
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
dipa
d
i
really
liked
this
one
more
black
ipas
need
to
be
made
poured
a
22oz
bomber
into
my
new
belgium
globe
this
beer
pours
more
of
the
color
of
a
english
black
tea
then
a
true
black
from
the
pour
a
nice
2
inch
head
that
was
remarkably
light
for
the
color
of
the
beer
came
forth
but
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
interesting
there
really
is
just
a
slight
hint
of
citrusy
hops
with
an
odd
aroma
that
i
can
really
describe
as
frozen
yogurt
the
taste
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
an
ipa
there
really
is
not
hop
presence
except
in
the
bitterness
of
it
the
malt
adds
more
body
then
flavor
also
the
one
really
defining
attribute
of
the
flavor
profile
is
a
strong
bitterness
at
that
finishes
its
way
to
bitter
and
comes
across
as
medicinal
like
sucking
on
an
aspirin
its
just
not
a
flattering
trait
in
a
beer
the
flavor
of
this
beer
is
really
off
putting
for
me
the
medicinal
qualities
are
just
to
much
i
definitely
wont
be
seeking
this
beer
out
again
not
very
drinkable
and
certainly
not
sessionable
i
would
expect
something
with
this
type
of
drinkability
to
have
a
higher
abv
and
a
little
alcohol
heat
couldnt
hurt
the
flavor
either
ill
probably
pass
on
the
dogzilla
in
the
future
very
well
made
ipa
with
a
touch
of
porter
or
stout
to
it
i
wont
go
through
the
details
but
if
you
are
looking
for
an
ipa
do
not
drink
this
beer
it
may
sound
novel
but
black
ipa
is
a
retarded
name
for
this
its
not
an
ipa
whatsoever
no
hop
flavor
in
the
taste
not
even
close
im
pissed
i
paid
4
30
for
this
ridiculous
look
elsewhere
fellow
hopheads
please
its
not
that
i
cant
drink
this
beer
its
just
that
i
really
am
not
pulled
back
to
it
like
some
others
i
would
probably
have
to
nurse
this
for
a
while
worth
a
shot
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
just
dont
expect
something
phenomenal
i
scored
this
a
little
better
than
average
because
i
applaud
their
effort
but
this
isnt
something
i
would
seek
out
again
unfortunately
laughing
dog
dogzilla
comes
nowhere
near
the
promise
of
its
name
and
label
i
dont
care
if
craft
breweries
come
up
with
green
ipas
purple
ipas
or
turquoise
ipas
as
long
as
theyre
good
ipas
this
one
doesnt
cut
the
mustard
d
this
is
a
unique
and
delicious
ipa
it
almost
tastes
like
a
strong
baltic
porter
mixed
with
a
west
coast
ipa
very
cool
and
different
drinks
okay
not
sessionable
for
me
would
have
this
again
interesting
pours
a
thin
redish
black
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
disapers
to
a
light
lacing
around
the
entire
rim
the
sent
of
hops
rushes
out
at
you
at
the
crack
of
the
cap
this
is
one
of
the
best
smelling
ipas
ever
the
taste
is
bitter
all
the
way
through
hints
of
coffiee
and
biscuts
caremel
yard
trimings
sweet
tobaco
and
strong
alchoal
this
is
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
agan
for
sure
d
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
a
good
one
either
ill
bet
theyre
good
on
tap
but
based
on
my
experiences
the
bottles
seem
to
be
off
it
is
really
smooth
and
has
a
nice
darker
aftertaste
the
aftertaste
exceeds
the
taste
but
the
drinkability
is
low
i
can
only
hope
this
is
a
bad
keg
or
a
dirty
line
a
cutting
pine
needle
and
citrus
in
the
aroma
but
the
quaff
puts
me
off
a
bit
too
much
woody
resin
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
i
luv
a
good
ipa
but
the
harshness
of
this
one
doesnt
set
well
i
didnt
taste
any
smoke
as
previous
reviewers
and
certainly
dont
think
this
is
an
a
beer

makes

no

i
will
be
buying
this
again
i
know
it
is
drinking
very
fresh
right
now
but
it
is
such
a
good
value
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
tan
head
about
what
i
expected
for
this
style
smell
is
mango
and
pineapple
wow
i
wasnt
expecting
that
flavor
is
malty
beer
with
citrus
and
pine
fucking
fantastic
so
its
certainly
a
good
reminder
when
a
brew
is
delicate
and
full
of
very
deliberate
effort
the
smallest
perturbations
can
truly
create
very
different
endproducts
pours
a
cola
brown
with
an
inch
and
a
half
of
a
creamy
wood
colored
head
it
smells
of
delicious
hoppy
raisins
the
taste
is
of
a
hoppy
chocolate
mixed
with
slight
fruitiness
and
finishes
with
a
not
over
powering
bitterness
it
feels
like
your
sucking
on
a
delightfully
moist
cloud
an
awesome
beer
i
like
this
because
the
juxtaposition
of
two
differing
styles
in
one
beer
to
me
is
amazing
hoppy
and
yet
stoutish
blows
my
mind
in
a
good
way
great
imperial
black
ale
a
burst
of
flavors
and
hop
bitterness
it
has
an
interesting
diverse
complexity
earthy
perfumy
citrusy
roasty
floral
chocolaty
and
fruity
simply
incredible
and
i
love
the
style
my
favorite
ipa
had
it
on
tap
yesterday
and
now
im
drinking
a
can
this
beer
is
very
good
dark
black
pour
good
amount
of
carbonation
fruity
roasted
aroma
taste
is
very
hoppy
citrus
with
some
roasted
flavors
very
interesting
but
very
good
best
black
ipa
ive
had
o
fantastic
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
pours
black
as
night
with
a
thick
surprisingly
light
colored
thick
head
despite
the
dark
color
the
beer
is
not
exactly
opaque
the
beer
has
malty
flavors
of
coffee
and
burned
sugar
as
well
as
crisp
hoppy
flavors
of
pine
and
mild
citrus
peel
a
complex
and
satisfying
beer
if
i
had
access
to
it
i
would
buy
it
every
now
and
then
fore
sure
i
believe
this
is
the
first
black
ipa
i
have
had
it
was
interesting
it
had
a
nice
hoppy
flavor
and
aroma
but
with
a
maltier
backbone
than
i
am
used
to
in
a
traditional
pale
ale
o
this
version
has
more
hop
forward
and
earthy
and
thicker
feel
than
the
three
floyds
bottle
a
fantastic
brew
that
is
best
enjoyed
one
slow
sip
at
a
time
the
explosive
flavor
of
this
one
will
catch
you
off
guard
if
you
dont
prepare
yourself
worth
every
penny
its
almost
too
much
this
insanely
dark
and
hoppy
collaboration
jet
black
on
the
pour
with
an
obsidian
luster
and
a
mocha
colored
half
inch
of
steady
head
the
nose
is
hops
bitter
and
vegetal
even
through
the
tremendously
robust
roasty
grain
bill
i
get
the
hops
first
in
terms
of
taste
this
is
pretty
two
dimensional
extremely
dark
roasty
barley
and
chocolate
malt
make
up
the
front
end
its
bakers
chocolate
and
tobacco
pavement
and
licorice
while
the
back
end
is
all
hops
not
particularly
flavorful
either
just
bitter
and
intense
its
almost
bitter
double
jeopardy
from
the
hops
and
the
roast
but
the
enormous
rich
body
cuts
some
of
that
or
at
least
spreads
it
out
over
a
longer
taste
experience
carbonation
is
about
average
but
no
amount
of
bubbles
could
lighten
this
one
to
drinkable
and
i
was
certainly
thankful
to
be
sharing
a
pint
can
very
intense
beer
taking
black
ipa
to
a
whole
new
level
in
the
way
that
i
dont
need
to
drink
more
than
one
120
minute
ipa
this
has
similar
properties
its
a
palate
bomb
too
so
finish
rather
than
start
your
session
with
blakkr
a
nice
black
ipa
and
among
the
better
ones
ive
had
its
no
wookey
jack
the
best
black
ipa
ever
but
its
not
far
behind
tasty
brew
overall
good
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
the
3
floyds
bottled
version
rich
and
flavorful
this
is
my
second
out
of
the
four
pack
from
the
surly
release
it
gets
better
with
every
can
the
smell
taste
and
overall
appearance
in
the
glass
is
great
for
an
imperial
high
in
alcohol
this
beer
is
well
balanced
and
full
bodied
at
the
same
time
never
had
anything
from
real
ale
and
i
am
guessing
the
love
of
metal
music
is
why
the
collaboration
happened
just
when
i
think
im
justified
in
staying
away
from
black
ipas
this
one
comes
along
and
sparks
my
interest
excellent
beer
i
hope
the
brewers
make
it
again
anyone
fond
of
espresso
and
lemon
should
try
this
a
fabulous
beer
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
socalled
black
ipa
this
is
as
dark
as
a
porter
or
stout
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
pine
the
taste
is
the
same
this
is
a
much
maltier
black
ipa
than
others
but
theres
still
a
piney
quality
that
marks
as
an
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
some
creaminess
very
smooth
quite
different
from
others
of
its
kind
like
sublimely
selfrighteous
but
a
great
beer
it
took
me
a
fair
amount
of
time
to
get
into
hoppy
black
ales
but
i
think
i
am
finally
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
beelzebub
is
back
from
alchemist
and
this
actually
reminds
me
of
that
somewhat
roast
and
cocoa
from
the
malts
compliment
the
citrus
fruity
hops
i
didnt
get
any
devil
powers
from
this
beer
as
far
as
i
can
tell
kinda
a
let
down
d
a
very
solid
offering
not
quite
top
tier
but
close
i
typically
dont
like
to
comment
on
price
but
will
here
not
quite
sure
the
end
result
can
justify
the
20
for
a
4pack
o
very
wellmade
beer
alcohol
is
well
hidden
the
flavor
is
complex
and
holds
two
different
beers
into
one
amazing
im
not
going
to
do
a
full
review
but
wanted
to
say
as
others
have
that
this
is
a
very
balanced
version
of
a
black
ipa
its
a
good
beer
and
the
strong
hoppy
taste
you
get
a
lot
on
the
nose
blends
well
with
the
smoky
malt
but
at
18
99
a
4pack
its
just
too
expensive
i
purchased
once
because
i
was
curious
its
gotten
good
reviews
and
i
love
both
fff
and
surly
but
i
cant
see
myself
dropping
another
20
on
a
4pack
of
this
for
fans
of
black
ipas
id
assume
thisll
be
a
real
hit
though
this
is
pretty
good
the
front
of
this
is
a
phenomenal
balance
of
hoppiness
and
toasted
malt
if
this
could
be
the
balance
and
complexity
of
the
front
id
love
it
to
death
this
is
easily
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
but
it
would
be
perfect
if
the
toasted
malt
were
more
prevalent
throughout
three
floyds
surly
real
ale
blakkr

pours
black
with
a
nice
lacing
tan
head
there
is
a
very
bold
and
prominent
hoppy
aroma
with
hints
of
burntness
the
taste
is
very
strong
rich
burnt

with
a
nice
bold
hoppy

and
good
hints
of
a

good

nice

overall
very
good
the
only
knock
is
it
may
be
just
a
tad
too
sweet
overall
surprised
by
the
high
abv
here
and
the
flavors
create
a
quite
challenging
blend
still
as
abas
go
this
is
a
good
one
im
sure
they
would
say
that
the
ingredients
used
cost
more
and
that
sticker
price
is
what
it
takes
to
produce
the
beer
and
make
a
small
profit
thats
all
fine
and
good
and
im
happy
i
tried
it
but
i
wont
have
it
again
unless
someone
else
is
buying
they
scorched
the
crap
out
of
me
with
this
one
it
tasted
quite
good
nonetheless
so
after
the
third
or
fourth
sip
i
had
to
look
it
up
online
on
my
phone
and
when
i
saw
the
abv
of
9
99
i
could
not
believe
it
no
way
this
beers
abv
is
9
99
i
sure
could
not
taste
the
alcohol
so
it
must
be
very
well
hidden
anyway
very
yummy
stuff
and
i
did
feel
tipsy
after
one
snifter
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
o
this
hoppy
black
ale
is
delicious
with
a
coffee
and
creaminess
that
is
hopped
up
in
a
big
way
different
from
other
hoppy
black
ales
and
damn
good
huge
contrast
between
whats
on
the
nose
and
the
flavors
presented
on
first
sip
really
unexpected
and
quite
a
surprise
really
impressed
by
this
one
and
a
real
unique
beer
in
the
black
ipa
realm
ooverall
oh
my
gosh
this
was
an
impressive
black
ipa
so
smooth
love
the
cask
good
beer
great
cross
between
a
imperial
stout
an
a
dipa
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
that
is
for
sure
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
a
mild
haze
and
a
quarter
inch
of
tan
head
the
aroma
offers
roast
smoke
charred
malt
a
hint
of
chocolate
resinous
hops
nice
flavor
with
everything
flowing
harmoniously
medium
bodied
with
appropriate
carbonation
lingering
hops
with
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
while
im
not
typically
a
big
fan
of
this
style
i
found
this
beer
unique
and
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
really
good
brew
right
up
there
with
black
top
from
new
glarus
as
far
as
im
concerned
glad
to
recommend
edit
tried
another
can
and
it
was
a
much
hoppier
brew
the
second
time
not
sure
what
happened
to
the
first
can
butt
his
one
is
much
much
better
grade
upped
from
a
3
66
superb
offering
of
this
particular
style
blakkr
is
bawesome
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
as
i
love
abrasive
and
it
has
many
of
the
same
charactoristics
this
is
not
usually
a
style
i
like
but
i
really
love
it
as
it
reminds
me
of
abrasive
the
pour
is
densely
black
with
a
strong
3
finger
head
aroma
is
ripe
grapefruit
mixed
with
a
rich
roasted
aroma
bit
of
chocolate
also
flavor
and
feel
is
smoother
than
expected
juicy
hops
that
segues
into
creamy
coffee
goes
from
bitter
to
a
creamy
sweetness
overall
black
ipas
need
to
be
very
good
this
is
good
but
doesnt
stand
out
in
a
lot
of
ways
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
surlys
abrasive
ale
which
is
a
100
beer
rated
beer
hence
my
lack
of
understanding
for
the
low
ratings
with
all
said
its
basically
abrasive
ale
with
some
roastiness
to
it
and
a
slight
hint
of
stout
qualities
just
very
very
good
i
know
theres
a
surly
overrated
ipa
id
call
this
surlys
underrated
ipa
pours
a
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
light
lace
nose
of
pine
and
grapefruit
char
and
roast
malt
bitter
chocolate
flavor
is
more
straight
forward
ipa
like
with
piles
of
pine
and
citrus
bitterness
very
light
dark
chocolate
and
a
bitter
pine
and
mild
ash
finish
medium
thick
high
carbonation
chewy
finish
overall
a
good
hop
bomb
for
sure
but
its
all
ipa
there
was
really
no
need
to
make
this
beer
dark
brown
as
any
kind
of
roasted
or
chocolate
flavors
that
would
be
produced
by
these
dark
grains
were
not
allowed
to
come
out
and
play
anyways
the
trick
with
a
hoppy
black
ale
is
to
hop
it
up
but
show
just
the
right
amount
of
restraint
so
the
character
of
the
dark
grains
can
play
a
role
in
the
flavor
profile
as
well
that
didnt
happen
here
might
as
well
just
make
a
regular
hop
bomb
dpa
and
call
it
ornggr
a
good
beer
that
we
enjoyed
but
not
representative
of
the
style
overall
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
doubt
id
be
able
to
drink
it
all
the
time
of
course
making
a
big
bruiser
of
a
beer
seems
like
what
they
were
going
for
the
can
calls
it
crushing
so
ill
give
it
a
little
extra
in
the
score
thanks
to
roostor07
for
the
can
o
i
didnt
love
this
i
graded
to
the
style
only
having
maybe
5
or
so
black
ipa
in
the
past
this
was
by
far
the
best
one
that
i
have
had
though
big
thanks
to
mike
for
this
one
great
experience
there
are
very
few
offerings
in
this
style
that
do
it
for
me
and
even
though
i
love
surly
blakkr
is
not
one
of
them
just
too
aggressive
and
bold
with
too
much
happening
certainly
representative
of
the
style
but
im
just
not
a
big
fan
o
much
better
execution
of
what
i
imagine
a
double
black
ipa
to
taste
like
far
better
than
three
floyds
take
on
this
beer
on
tap
at
denver
bicycle
cafe
was
very
excited
to
try
this
beer
i
dont
usually
go
for
black
ipas
but
having
heard
such
good
things
about
this
one
i
decided
that
i
had
to
get
some
very
well
balanced
the
hops
are
out
front
but
not
offensive
roasted
coffee
flavors
from
malt
worked
well
with
the
hop
profile
very
dry
glad
i
got
to
try
it
o
pretty
good
black
ipa
hop
notes
are
what
i
prefer
more
citrusforward
with
pine
backing
that
up
maltiness
is
nice
as
well
not
overbearing
but
still
present
with
flavors
of
cocoa
and
coffee
and
roast
overall
wellexecuted
and
fairly
unique
this
is
very
good
beer
from
three
very
good
breweries
i
tried
a
can
cold
and
tried
one
warm
cold
it
is
a
good
beer
but
at
room
temp
this
beer
shines
you
get
more
flavor
at
room
temp
and
i
think
that
is
the
way
to
drink
it
let
it
warm
up
a
little
bit
and
the
flavors
meld
a
lot
better
either
way
its
a
good
beer
but
so
good
letting
it
breathe
and
warm
up
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
good
super
thick
body
is
cut
with
mild
carbonation
lots
of
sticky
hop
oils
and
resin
along
with
an
aggressive
bitterness
recommendation
how
could
you
go
wrong
with
these
three
great
breweries
pick
it
up
while
its
available
not
sure
on
whether
this
will
be
replicated
hard
to
say
any
beer
is
worth
this
cost
but
man
is
this
a
nice
beer
o
so
glad
i
sought
this
out
and
bought
it
on
release
date
in
my
area
these
3
brewers
nailed
this
very
unique
delicious
have
3
more
left
othis
is
really
special
i
may
buy
one
more
fourpack
of
this
before
i
am
done
lovely
a
little
pricey
perhaps
i
paid
18
99
for
the
4pack
o
not
too
shabby
i
like
it
and
do
love
all
of
the
characteristics
of
a
black
aleipa
total
3350
highly
recommended
if
you
dig
the
styleits
comparable
to
a
dark
roasty
abrasive
i
would
say
o
im
pretty
happy
and
excited
that
this
collab
happened
specially
here
in
texas
where
so
many
collabs
are
occuring
right
now
and
the
craft
beer
scene
is
growing
like
never
before
this
is
an
incredibly
enjoyable
black
ale
since
it
feels
more
like
it
than
an
ipa
it
takes
the
roastiness
from
the
aba
and
the
hop
power
from
the
iipa
to
make
a
great
showcase
for
the
beer
style
and
the
hops
used
in
it
loved
the
huge
hop
aroma
that
emanates
from
it
but
not
so
much
the
dryness
of
the
beer
its
a
definite
repeat
but
one
for
the
night
seems
like
enough
coming
together
from
three
different
locations
has
got
to
make
it
a
little
difficult
to
put
together
a
masterpiece
im
sure
but
this
beer
is
a
very
solid
black
ipa
glad
to
finally
see
a
surly
and
a
three
floyds
brew
in
texas
a
very
nice
dark
ipa
o
as
stated
above
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
but
its
up
there
as
far
as
the
ones
ive
had
not
on
par
with
wookie
jack
or
stones
15th
anni
but
solid
the
flavor
is
just
as
intense
with
soapy
resinous
bitterness
up
front
chocolate
follows
and
is
killed
off
completely
by
grapefruit
citrus
wall
of
hops
this
is
a
nice
medium
to
full
bodies
roasty
super
bitter
beer
with
medium
carbonation
definitely
lives
up
to
the
name
and
the
mental
hype
i
have
it
as
soon
as
i
heard
they
were
doing
a
black
metal
collab
this
is
insanely
good
and
tops
wookey
jack
as
my
favorite
black
ipa
o
another
great
dipa
from
breweries
known
for
great
dipas
but
not
too
different
and
innovative
final
thoughts
wow
was
skeptical
going
in
but
definitely
an
amazing
beer
my
favorite
beer
is
abrasive
and
blakkr
could
easily
be
its
cousin
the
nearly
18
price
point
may
seem
steep
but
this
beer
is
worth
it
this
should
definitely
be
a
yearly
release
phenomenal
would
i
drink
it
again
duh
o
solid
black
ipa
great
collaboration
effort
really
good
for
the
style
but
in
my
opinion
not
on
the
level
of
say
stones
versions
the
hops
dont
blend
quite
as
well
as
they
could
and
the
flavor
is
fairly
simple
its
like
a
toneddown
black
version
of
abrasive
that
could
be
amazing
but
its
merely
good
if
you
can
find
any
version
of
this
get
it
surly
fff
and
real
ale
in
blanco
tx
have
the
same
recipe
o
a
great
black
ipa
that
is
both
smoky
and
hoppy
resiny
dankness
a
good
oneoff
from
surly
and
co
m
big
medium
leading
to
full
creamy
very
tasty
cant
go
wrong
with
surly
or
3
floyds
stuff
sorry
but
never
had
anything
from
the
3rd
collaberator
real
ale
brewing
great
black
ale
the
bottle
was
12
99
i
believe
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
again
if
you
get
a
chance
to
pick
this
up
do
it
o
im
not
completely
sold
on
the
black
ipas
yet
i
thought
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
id
sooner
just
grab
an
abrasive
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sweet
profile
in
a
hop
forward
beer
but
a
good
offering
pours
nearly
pitch
black
capped
by
an
off
white
one
and
half
finger
head
average
retention
fairly
significant
splotchy
lacing
light
wisps
of
citrus
hints
of
espresso
and
roast
touches
of
burnt
chocolate
malt
and
perhaps
even
a
bit
of
toffee
on
the
nose
opens
with
light
caramel
notes
and
light
cocoa
powder
tropical
fruit
accents
join
in
including
pineapple
and
mango
caramel
and
toffee
accented
maltiness
is
joined
by
bold
passionfruit
transitions
into
bitter
citrus
rind
which
give
way
to
espressotinged
bitterness
and
clean
alcohol
well
carbonated
lighter
to
average
medium
body
that
is
smooth
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
here
and
there
one
of
the
better
brews
in
the
style
having
enjoyed
three
floyds
version
previously
i
actually
prefer
surlys
version
just
a
bit
more
overall
a
hypnotic
collaborative
from
three
heavilyhyped
breweries
love
the
can
art
love
the
tart
fruit
on
the
front
end
love
the
complexity
and
long
steady
finish
that
dissipates
into
a
winelike
dryroast
acidity
the
aftertaste
is
the
lingering
aftermath
of
a
rich
brunch
washed
down
by
the
last
sip
of
orange
juice
mixed
5050
with
cava
blakkr
is
the
best
black
ipa
ive
tasted
to
the
date
of
this
review
i
feel
bettr
about
the
future
of
this
hybrid
category
after
having
drank
this
beer
when
i
popped
the
top
i
was
wondering
if
blakkr
would
be
revelatory
or
disappointing
at
the
final
countdown
it
was
neither
i
do
really
like
the
hoppy
twist
on
the
style
a
very
good
beer
o
not
bad
at
all
black
ipas
cascadaian
dark
ales
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
normally
dont
overly
excite
me
but
this
is
a
solid
american
black
ale
the
combo
between
ipa
and
dark
ale
works
well
and
neither
component
overpowers
the
other
good
but
not
worth
the
price
of
admission
19
a
four
pack
ouch
overall
lots
and
lots
of
hops
flavor
and
aroma
the
strongest
smelling
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
im
not
a
big
black
ipablack
alehoppy
dark
fan
but
this
tastes
pretty
good
to
me
i
suppose
the
hops
are
just
overwhelming
everything
now
if
youll
excuse
me
im
going
to
have
another
overall
a
very
good
imperial
black
ale
good
mix
of
citrus
and
piney
hop
flavors
with
a
good
balance
of
dark
malt
a
pretty
cool
collaboration
from
surly
three
floyds
and
real
ale
medium
to
full
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
the
alcohol
is
very
well
disguised
which
is
always
a
sign
of
a
well
made
beer
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
this
is
a
beast
but
i
do
have
a
lovehate
for
it
great
complexity
great
flavors
but
i
think
its
too
over
the
top
pungent
it
takes
away
from
what
it
could
have
been
still
really
like
it
and
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
get
a
bottle
i
am
a
minnesotan
that
wont
automatically
give
a
surly
beer
a
high
score
i
think
blakkr
failed
as
a
imperial
black
ale
but
it
has
outstanding
hop
aroma
and
flavor
and
is
immensely
complimented
by
its
body
but
this
is
not
the
next
greatest
thing
overall
fantastic
collaboration
here
i
cant
believe
this
is
10
even
though
the
taste
is
decadent
enough
for
the
abv
it
is
also
fairly
easy
to
drink
i
hope
this
somehow
is
not
just
a
one
and
done
release
this
reminds
me
of
about
80
percent
abrasive
blended
with
10
percent
darkness
and
10
percent
smoke
probably
inspired
by
those
but
damn
the
hop
profile
is
so
abrasive
like
drinks
very
easy
for
the
abv
a
great
take
on
the
style
but
does
carry
a
hefty
price
tag
at
nearly
5
a
can
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
had
to
try
since
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
three
floyds
and
surly
kinda
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
mixed
with
a
stout
cant
really
put
a
finger
on
it
but
i
like
it
might
work
good
in
some
trades
too
cheers
bitterness
lingers
throughout
the
finish
as
the
pine
citrus
and
tropical
notes
are
fading
slowly
into
the
more
roasty
toasty
blackened
malt
elements
ultimately
leaving
an
almost
an
espresso
coffee
like
aftertaste
delicious
beer
black
malts
and
all
and
with
a
10
abv
it
packs
a
pleasant
punch
i
dont
believe
ive
ever
tried
anything
from
real
ale
but
with
plenty
of
experience
of
the
other
two
breweries
i
get
a
sense
of
the
3
floyds
and
surly
dna
in
every
sip
and
now
the
glass
is
empty
time
for
another
even
with
17d
f
expected
tonight
and
who
knows
9
99
feet
of
snow
on
the
ground
at
the
end
of
february
its
good
to
live
in
minnesota
o
not
bad
im
typically
not
a
fan
of
black
ales
but
really
enjoyed
the
big
hop
profile
in
this
one
gets
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
o
not
a
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
is
an
exception
a
great
brew
with
which
leans
more
toward
the
2ipa
side
but
has
plenty
of
porter
qualities
21714
can
date
beer
pours
super
black
nice
threefinger
head
hop
aroma
is
like
a
subdued
abrasive
taste
is
fairly
flat
onenote
but
has
a
very
pleasant
roasty
hoppy
aftertaste
alcohol
is
virtually
undetectable
but
sneaks
up
quickly
on
you
hard
to
justify
this
over
other
great
options
at
this
pricepoint
but
will
gladly
drink
the
remainder
of
the
4pack
shits
good
i
like
it
a
lot
black
ipa
had
a
kid
with
imperial
porter
and
they
smoked
while
pregnant
here
is
the
result
ooutstanding
collaboration
by
floyds
surly
and
real
ale
serving
type
bottle
overall
pretty
surprised
by
this
its
very
good
with
lots
of
different
flavors
to
pick
over
pretty
nice
beer
i
have
been
overlooking
rogue
entirely
too
much
i
really
liked
the
smell
i
couldnt
stop
sniffing
it
to
be
honest
this
tastes
very
much
like
guinness
without
the
hydrogen
its
a
thirst
quencher
with
maybe
a
bit
more
to
it
i
liked
it
a
lot
i
would
get
it
again
if
i
got
it
for
the
same
overstocked
price
good
pairing
with
grilled
flesh
o
quite
distinct
very
interesting
and
wellcrafted
with
a
good
sweetbitter
balance
however
neither
the
aroma
nor
the
flavor
profiles
were
entirely
to
my
liking
as
intended
i
guess
excellent
with
asian
cuisine
from
memory
more
interesting
but
not
quite
as
enjoyable
as
rogue
morimoto
soba
ale
not
a
fruitvegetable
beer
overall
well
i
havent
had
the
other
rogue
soba
ales
but
this
is
making
me
think
i
should
have
pricey
but
worth
trying
particularly
if
one
is
interested
by
beers
that
are
whole
or
in
part
brewed
with
glutenfree
grains
i
thought
rogue
was
through
making
these
so
i
was
super
excited
to
see
this
on
the
shelf
the
pour
is
jet
black
inky
and
thicker
with
a
hard
to
control
rising
off
white
head
that
has
a
mind
of
its
own
it
smells
like
burnt
toast
and
a
really
weird
malt
profile
had
to
google
it
to
learn
soba
is
japanese
buckwheat
which
definitely
provides
some
interesting
smells
and
tastes
here
its
sort
of
like
rye
in
terms
of
smell
bold
and
fully
rich
but
the
flavor
is
much
more
mild
without
the
spice
and
with
a
starchy
sort
of
feel
with
the
other
black
roasty
malts
and
bittering
hops
i
think
it
works
great
in
this
beer
there
is
also
a
new
yeast
going
on
thats
foreign
to
my
palate
or
maybe
its
just
the
buckwheat
again
hard
to
tell
but
its
pasty
in
texture
and
bitterly
bland
in
a
good
way
of
thats
possible
a
complex
brew
with
an
exceptional
mouthfeel
huge
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
it
really
shocks
the
palate
as
something
different
and
well
done
i
like
this
better
than
the
imperial
pils
and
fully
support
anything
involving
chef
morimoto
his
work
in
the
kitchen
is
unrivaled
overall
an
interestingly
different
but
ultimately
disappointing
beer
especially
considering
it
came
at
a
cost
of
au15
a
bottle
2013
i
simply
cant
justify
the
cost
for
a
beer
that
is
alright
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
this
beer
was
a
bit
off
for
me
it
had
a
nice
flavor
similar
to
a
brown
ale
but
it
wasnt
full
flavored
enough
for
me
i
wish
it
had
been
a
bit
more
assertive
it
may
be
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
morimoto
black
obi
soba
ale
version
poured
a
dark
brown
with
an
averaged
sized
tan
head
aromas
of
light
roast
nuts
and
caramel
tastes
of
nuts
some
dark
fruits
and
caramel
nutty
malty
sweet
with
a
very
light
bitter
finish
tastes
and
aromas
were
both
on
the
subtle
side
body
on
the
thinner
side
some
lacing
left
on
the
glass
to
be
honest
i
poured
it
out
halfway
through
hopefully
we
had
an
old
bottle
or
something
because
it
was
just
not
enjoyable
this
tastes
like
no
beer
ive
had
and
if
i
was
blindfolded
id
be
hardpressed
to
call
it
a
beer
doesnt
really
taste
like
me
provides
no
hint
of
alcohol
its
not
bad
its
just
not
close
to
good
more
or
less
a
waste
of
8
99
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
little
ale
but
one
complaint
that
i
have
is
that
it
really
lacks
any
sort
of
recognizable
buckwheat
flavor
until
the
finish
even
then
this
flavor
only
comes
across
very
briefly
to
me
it
makes
no
sense
to
make
a
buckwheat
beer
that
neither
smells
nor
tastes
all
that
much
like
buckwheat
still
this
one
doesnt
taste
bad
and
is
solidly
constructed
so
i
cant
fault
it
too
much
mouthfeel
is
lighter
side
of
medium
with
firm
carbonation
o
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
ok
for
something
different
but
there
are
other
similar
beer
i
would
choose
first
d
this
was
ok
it
is
listed
as
a
fruitvegetable
beer
but
i
cant
place
anything
outside
of
a
black
ale
although
i
dont
run
across
soba
very
often
i
dont
think
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
specifically
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
o
not
sure
what
soba
is
but
this
beer
definitely
has
a
unique
flavour
profile
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
for
what
its
worth
o
a
tasty
dark
ale
thats
easily
drinkable
and
offers
some
unique
flavours
that
being
said
its
not
something
that
would
make
an
lasting
impression
o
great
session
beer
not
over
the
top
in
any
aspects
just
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
would
probably
be
better
sold
in
a
cheaper
six
pack
option
not
my
type
of
beer
good
in
his
way
different
but
good
theres
a
stout
element
to
the
flavor
of
dark
unsweetened
coffee
the
body
is
very
thin
with
a
high
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
all
burnt
malt
flavors
no
notable
hop
o
decent
for
3
5
abv
but
very
plain
the
aroma
was
pleasant
albeit
a
little
lighter
then
i
was
expecting
nice
touches
of
molasses
and
maple
syrup
weighed
in
heavily
though
the
spices
seemed
to
be
all
but
covered
up
under
a
bit
too
hot
alcohol
profile
the
flavor
though
started
to
redeem
itself
quite
nicely
rich
notes
of
maple
syrup
and
molasses
washed
over
the
tongue
immediatly
falling
into
a
spiced
yam
like
flavor
that
was
layered
on
top
of
a
nice
bready
malt
profile
this
wasnt
really
all
that
i
had
hoped
a
bit
muddled
and
somewhat
tough
to
drink
o
good
beer
i
will
have
a
gain
well
rounded
and
a
nice
sweet
balance
of
flavor
that
does
not
get
sugary
or
artificial
tasting
opinion
this
beer
had
me
going
up
to
the
first
sip
and
then
it
fell
apart
for
me
i
liked
the
look
and
aroma
quite
a
bit
but
the
aggression
that
they
used
on
the
hopping
really
killed
this
beer
it
is
so
light
however
many
ibus
they
added
was
probably
about
double
the
amount
necessary
for
this
beer
this
beer
was
delicate
enough
that
they
didnt
need
to
do
that
to
it
but
whatever
it
is
what
it
is
an
overly
bittered
beer
with
some
interesting
notes
in
the
aroma
that
arent
able
to
shine
through
in
the
flavor
i
wont
need
to
go
back
to
this
one
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
one
i
had
this
one
right
after
the
other
morimoto
ale
and
found
this
one
to
be
a
little
awkward
the
pour
looked
good
had
a
deep
brown
color
similar
to
a
black
lager
but
with
a
super
sized
head
on
it
that
was
tan
in
color
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
too
the
aromas
were
mixed
on
this
it
has
grassy
aromas
and
some
herbal
notes
the
taste
was
a
little
strange
im
cant
really
explain
it
i
just
tasted
gross
to
me
i
was
able
to
finish
it
but
i
wont
being
buying
this
again
d
quite
drinkable
would
be
more
so
if
the
carbonation
was
dialled
back
just
a
little
md
i
like
the
melange
of
different
flavors
here
using
those
specialty
grainsmalts
complex
tasting
but
not
heavy
at
all
a
unique
beer
worth
a
try
this
is
a
good
brew
and
it
does
go
well
with
pork
as
stated
on
the
bottle
a
highly
drinkable
enjoyable
brew
another
winner
from
rogue
d
great
serious
food
beer
could
be
served
at
fine
dining
establishments
or
just
with
great
pub
food
o
definitely
give
this
a
try
d
i
could
probably
drink
a
lot
of
it
because
it
is
a
little
watery
but
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
another
bottle
d
quite
unique
but
im
not
sure
that
it
really
does
it
for
me
i
definitely
like
certain
aspects
of
the
beer
but
im
glad
im
splitting
the
bottle
d
given
the
ingredients
used
this
ale
turned
out
well
a
nice
curiosity
but
nothing
ill
be
drinking
again
soon
this
is
a
really
complex
beer
not
sure
if
the
other
soba
ale
from
rogue
is
at
all
similar
but
now
i
have
to
go
try
it
to
compare
this
beer
is
many
different
styles
combined
at
once
they
clash
but
not
in
a
bad
way
i
have
never
been
so
intrigued
and
pleased
at
the
same
time
especially
from
a
beer
under
5
abv
flavour
is
the
same
with
roast
beef
and
molasses
add
some
indistinct
fruit
and
a
fine
carbonation
this
is
really
enjoyable
and
complex
i
found
it
hard
to
place
but
thoroughly
liked
it
a
pity
its
deer
in
oz
md
quite
clean
on
the
palate
while
the
finish
features
a
faintly
powdery
texture
medbodied
reasonably
flavoursome
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brown
ale
that
never
goes
quite
thin
or
watery
d
great
a
touch
on
the
sweet
side
but
could
pound
this
all
day
all
in
all
an
interesting
brew
that
lends
itself
well
to
light
food
and
cheese
pairings
great
with
fresh
chevre
and
pain
au
levain
or
cream
cheese
and
a
bagel
d
not
terribly
drinkable
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
and
the
flavor
doesnt
lend
itself
well
to
drinking
a
lot
or
frequently
was
a
decent
pairing
for
sushi
but
better
for
the
octopus
salad
would
definitely
get
again
over
the
typical
sappro
or
kirin
drinkability
quite
drinkable
the
flavor
is
pretty
unique
and
with
the
low
gravity
it
doesnt
punch
hard
drinkablility
is
above
average
this
beer
is
smooth
and
nicely
carbonated
with
a
clean
finish
medium
bodied
i
would
definitely
try
it
again
d
interesting
brew
that
goes
down
easily
not
totally
sure
how
it
all
fits
together
but
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
overall
impression
it
was
impossible
to
pour
this
beer
without
excessive
foaming
and
since
the
head
retention
excellent
that
was
an
issue
the
high
carbonation
killed
this
beer
in
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
as
well
that
sucks
because
it
had
a
pretty
interesting
flavor
im
hoping
this
was
an
isolated
incident
that
said
its
a
bit
pricey
why
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
flavors
i
found
in
this
beer
and
quite
enjoyed
the
nut
flavors
and
its
over
all
drinkability
drinkability
not
as
impressed
with
this
as
the
other
morimoto
ale
from
them
i
think
the
taste
here
seemed
rather
muted
throughout
the
smell
is
good
but
after
that
the
ale
is
just
ok
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
at
the
price
while
this
is
replete
with
a
flavour
that
i
dont
get
much
exposure
to
the
yakisoba
noodles
that
i
indulge
in
frequently
bear
no
relation
to
this
i
still
quite
enjoyed
the
light
roasted
and
nutty
nature
of
this
beer
not
quite
sure
what
style
of
beer
this
is
as
the
vegetableherb
classification
seems
way
too
pithy
and
general
for
such
an
interesting
offering
tastes
like
buckwheat
pancakes
dipped
in
a
soso
brown
ale
somewhat
of
a
nutty
complexity
that
i
enjoy
typical
pacman
mouthfeel
overall
decent
beer
and
drinkable
enough
but
im
not
sure
what
i
think
of
it
i
enjoyed
it
enough
and
i
get
the
feeling
this
beer
is
exactly
what
it
was
intended
to
be
but
im
not
sure
if
id
really
want
it
again
glad
to
have
had
it
though
beer
poured
a
pretty
dark
brown
but
not
too
dark
to
see
through
with
some
light
practically
no
head
except
when
poured
hard
fairly
smooth
not
overly
carbonated
so
pretty
easy
on
the
tongue
nothing
overwhelmingly
present
that
really
stands
out
but
some
mild
fruit
flavor
mild
hops
and
what
seems
a
slight
spice
flavor
low
in
alcohol
so
between
that
and
the
easy
taste
the
drinkability
stays
at
a
decent
level
wouldnt
be
a
problem
to
have
a
few
one
of
rogues
better
offerings
i
would
say
i
will
be
revisiting
this
brew
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
slightly
fruity
beers
just
like
the
og
morimoto
soba
ale
black
obi
is
a
wonderful
and
unique
beer
to
enjoy
especially
with
food
its
definitely
earned
its
black
belt
roasted
buckwheat
different
but
ultimately
successful
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
mug
and
was
pretty
attractive
dark
brown
with
some
red
highlights
a
thick
tan
head
not
much
aroma
just
some
sweet
fruit
the
taste
was
an
improvementwith
some
dark
fruit
hazlenut
and
a
little
late
hops
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
is
a
different
beer
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
it
lacks
in
overall
complexity
and
fails
to
really
show
off
the
central
ingredient
the
mouthfeel
isnt
bad
but
the
grip
does
make
it
a
bit
more
difficult
to
drink
id
pair
this
with
a
grilled
sesame
tuna
or
a
woodplankgrilledsalmon
and
you
will
not
be
disappointed
another
interesting
morimoto
beer
d
good
variety
of
flavors
to
make
this
somewhat
complex
and
not
overpowering
in
any
sense
pours
a
semitransparent
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thick
fluffy
light
dirty
tan
head
that
hangs
around
for
a
bit
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
smoky
and
nutty
hints
flavor
is
malty
with
hints
of
hops
roast
nuts
and
caramel
and
even
a
bit
of
oak
texture
is
lively
and
tingly
sometimes
just
a
wee
bit
wan
but
still
good
it
leaves
a
mysterious
aftertaste
a
little
like
smoked
wood
a
caramel
malt
flavor
and
graininess
in
the
mouth
with
a
syrupy
finish
certainly
a
nice
finish
but
not
quite
as
well
balanced
as
most
stouts
or
porters
has
the
unequal
finish
similar
to
many
smoked
beers
d
as
interesting
as
the
lighter
version
with
perhaps
a
bit
more
depth
nice
and
hoppy
but
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
there
were
any
odd
ingredients
in
here
if
i
didnt
know
better
i
can
taste
the
buckwheat
cuz
i
know
its
in
there
but
those
flavors
are
similar
to
and
can
be
interpreted
as
flavors
that
we
get
from
different
varieties
of
barley
malt
especially
when
the
whole
shebang
is
roasted
cheers
d
my
first
experience
with
a
beer
brewed
with
buckwheat
and
overall
a
pleasurable
quaff
really
unique
stuff
going
on
here
which
must
be
the
buckwheat
as
this
brew
has
thankfully
escaped
the
sameness
plaguing
much
of
rogues
line
up
interesting
and
notable
hop
bill
as
well
spanning
a
wide
range
of
flavors
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
another
good
offer
from
rogue
d
quite
a
flavourful
beer
quite
sessionable
drinkability
worth
a
try
though
perhaps
a
more
worthy
of
a
try
than
their
other
sobabased
brew
quite
quaffable
all
around
though
d
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
moromoto
black
obi
soba
ale
its
something
different
than
the
norm
and
was
very
tasty
recommended
dont
drink
and
review
anyway
definitely
glad
i
was
able
to
try
since
i
am
a
huge
rogue
fan
as
well
as
a
fan
of
morimoto
not
high
on
my
list
for
a
return
visit
yet
not
bad
either
the
soba
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
it
seems
like
the
type
of
beer
that
would
pair
up
nicely
with
food
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wish
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
morimoto
black

pours
clear

with
a

aroma

cocoa
heavy

thin
mouthfeel
taste
is
weak
coffee
and
cocoa
with
toasted

grainy
earthy
and
veggie
really
felt
like
it
was
missing
something
lingering
aftertaste
of
roasted
malt
and
alcohol
good
not
great
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
different
from
what
i
have
had
lately
a
good
change
of
pace
and
a
beer
i
would
definitely
have
again
pours
a
very
dark
brownred
body
smallish
tannish

diminishing
but
lingering
dark

aroma
like

maybe
some
coffee
purple

coffee
some
chocolate
aftertaste
creamy
mouthfeel
pretty
tasty
d
i
always
love
trying
something
new
and
this
certainly
qualifies
im
glad
they
made
this
but
this
one
bottle
more
than
satisfies
my
curiosity
drinkability
although
i
dont
remember
drinking
the
regular
obi
soba
ale
i
do
remember
liking
it
and
thinking
it
was
fairly
unique
im
fairly
sure
i
like
this
better
like
its
brother
though
its
definitely
unique
good
beer
that
if
you
happen
to
see
it
around
or
rogue
releases
it
again
give
it
a
shot
when
you
have
this
with
omakase
at
the
restaurant
it
is
great
i
dont
know
how
it
would
stand
up
on
its
own
but
i
feel
like
it
would
fall
a
bit
short
in
the
taste
factor
on
its
own
get
the
hazelnut
it
is
considerably
better
then
this
brew
and
matches
better
with
the
seafood
heavy
menu
the
aroma
was
real
nutty
and
soba
smelling
the
taste
was
malty
and
finished
strong
with
a
real
noticeable
soba
flavor
it
was
nicely
carbonated
and
left
a
good
soba
taste
on
the
tongue
overall
it
was
a
real
solid
fruitvegetable
brew
d
drinks
great
for
a
darker
beer
compliments
food
well
out
of
the
brown
bomber
bottle
this
one
poured
a
dark
coca
cola
brown
with
a
huge
light
brown
head
great
retention
and
very
sticky
lacing
roasted
malt
aroma
with
herbal
hops
in
there
too
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
too
the
roasted
soba
is
apparent
in
the
unusual
flavor
profile
woody
and
nutty
with
a
pleasant
hop
kick
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
coffee
and
bakers
chocolate
smooth
mouthfeel
and
full
bodied
without
being
heavy
quite
good
but
not
as
unique
as
all
the
ingredients
suggest
it
should
be
d
actually
a
pretty
big
fan
of
this
beer
much
better
than
the
regular
form
too
bad
its
being
phased
out
cherry
stout
fans
would
def
enjoy
this
d
a
pretty
cool
beer
finishing
the
bomber
is
no
problem
like
the
lighter
morimoto
ale
though
im
left
thinking
that
i
really
had
to
pair
it
with
appropriate
food
to
truly
experience
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
its
excellent
by
itself
but
it
would
really
shine
at
the
dinner
table
probably
with
some
asianfusion
cuisine
otherwise
if
a
dry
tangy
dark
beer
sounds
like
your
idea
of
a
good
time
definitely
pick
this
one
up
the
flavor
delivers
initially
but
seems
to
fall
short
of
being
truly
full
and
robust
its
like
a
light
version
of
a
really
good
porter
a
dark
richness
comes
across
but
im
left
wanting
more
for
so
dark
an
ale
it
is
quite
crisp
as
the
label
claims
its
unique
ill
give
it
that
glad
i
tried
it
once
so
drinkabilitys
not
awful
neither
is
the
flavor
but
its
hardly
refreshing
or
appealing
just
not
sure
why
or
when
id
ever
want
to
drink
this
beer
again
i
like
weird
beer
but
its
also
got
to
taste
good
geez
that
bells
third
coast
old
ale
is
looking
pretty
good
about
now
if
you
are
one
of
the
folks
that
thinks
that
morimoto
gets
no
respect
on
iron
chef
america
at
least
he
has
two
beers
produced
by
rogue
i
dont
know
about
those
folks
but
id
consider
having
a
beer
named
after
me
to
be
a
huge
sign
of
respect
d
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
but
one
bomber
is
enough
for
a
while
morimoto
is
my
favorite
chef
but
i
may
have
to
wait
to
have
another
bomber
of
this
until
i
dine
at
his
restaurant
in
new
york
not
only
was
this
a
good
tasting
beer
i
think
it
would
be
awesome
to
cook
with
not
sure
why
its
retired
they
had
plenty
of
it
at
rp
packie
great
appearance
solid
dark
black
with
some
brown
amber
colors
in
the
light
creamy
lacing
with
a
thin
head
metallic
aromas
wrapped
around
weak
hops
are
a
little
flavorless
but
there
are
some
roasty
smells
especially
from
some
simple
malts
the
taste
has
a
fruity
almost
roasted
grapelike
flavor
to
the
beverage
with
a
dry
finish
good
carbonation
allows
it
to
be
crisp
but
really
cant
help
the
flavors
overall
a
rollercoaster
beer
in
extremes
definitely
a
different
kind
of
beer
worth
picking
up
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
this
is
an
excellent
version
of
an
american
specialty
porter
i
like
most
rogue
brews
and
this
was
no
exception
ok
we
just
got
this
beer
in
vancouver
and
now
its
retired
this
is
a
much
tastier
darker
brother
to
the
regular
soba
ale
the
beer
looks
like
cocacola
with
a
tan
head
the
nose
is
malty
and
kinda
bready
that
soba
taste
works
really
well
with
the
dark
malts
kinda
like
germany
meets
japan
i
can
see
this
being
made
in
the
sapporo
brewhouse
a
very
food
friendly
beer
that
has
an
unique
taste
quite
drinkable
but
nothing
impressive
this
poured
a
very
dark
amberbrown
with
red
highlights
the
thick
foamy
brown
head
that
didnt
stick
around
for
long
and
the
lacing
was
moderate
to
light
the
rich
aroma
is
fruity
and
malty
at
first
next
comes
the
chocolate
and
nut
smell
i
also
picked
up
on
a
faint
alcoholic
smell
but
the
abv
isnt
listed
the
blend
of
flavors
is
very
unique
and
rich
the
maltiness
is
almost
overbearing
but
the
combination
of
nut
fruit
and
floral
hops
keeps
the
flavor
rich
and
varied
the
flavor
of
bitter
chocolate
is
barely
a
hint
in
the
taste
and
not
as
notable
as
in
the
aroma
the
feel
is
crisp
but
smooth
this
is
drinkable
but
a
bomber
is
plenty
drinkable
considering
overcharredastringent
character
didnt
know
it
was
retired
and
had
i
known
i
might
have
saved
the
bottle
a
bit
longer
but
its
been
hanging
around
for
a
few
months
so
it
was
time
if
you
can
get
a
hold
of
it
its
worth
a
try
if
not
its
no
big
loss
d
good
drinkability
with
a
nice
roasted
and
fruity
palate
that
kept
things
interesting
throughout
the
drink
drinkability
i
guess
this
is
retired
a
nice
brew
overall
and
something
i
enjoyed
but
im
not
sure
if
id
buy
it
again
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
getting
into
with
buying
this
on
a
whim
but
it
was
definitely
an
interesting
experience
overall
this
beer
was
really
interesting
and
a
work
out
for
the
tastebuds
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
id
pick
it
up
again
overall
i
am
having
a
hard
time
with
this
beer
its
good
but
im
having
trouble
identifying
and
understanding
it
its
like
a
standalone
beer
that
i
could
easily
comeback
to
but
wouldnt
think
of
when
im
in
a
insert
style
mood
this
poured
a
clear
dark
brown
with
a
slight
amount
of
light
tan
head
it
smelled
very
faintly
of
basic
malt
with
not
much
else
noticeable
in
the
scent
it
tasted
slightly
bitter
and
very
earthy
like
oak
and
malt
mixed
with
prunes
it
was
watery
with
slight
carbonation
and
it
had
a
mildly
bitter
and
moderately
spicy
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
subtle
and
mild
beer
without
much
to
hold
my
attention
im
really
not
sure
where
i
stand
with
this
one
as
i
had
more
i
got
used
to
it
but
it
never
completely
grew
on
me
overall
pretty
good
still
and
very
unique
which
is
a
quality
i
always
appreciate
pours
a
great
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
nice
fizzy
head
and
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
slightly
burnt
grain
aroma
reminiscent
of
a
stout
but
thats
as
far
as
the
stout
comparison
goes
very
nice
flavor
but
hard
to
pinpoint
everything
there
is
a
slight
yeastiness
about
it
along
with
a
general
lager
feel
and
a
nice
tanginess
from
the
soba
im
guessing
goes
down
very
well
unusual
and
wellexecuted
though
not
a
new
favorite
for
me
certainly
not
rogues
best
brew
but
an
easilydrinkable
light
refreshing
beer
nonetheless
pours
an
almost
opaque
deep
black
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
some
dried
fruits
and
dark
malt
but
rather
weak
taste
showed
characteristics
of
both
a
porter
and
a
nut
brown
with
a
hint
of
wheat
texture
and
some
dried
fruit
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
low
carbonation
this
one
is
rather
enjoyable
but
nothing
all
that
special
d
i
recommend
as
this
was
a
great
from
first
to
last
sip
a
joy
to
drink
and
could
have
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
definite
buy
and
try
pours
to
a
highly
carbonated
inch
and
a
half
of
rich
tan
head
sticking
to
the
glass
slightly
as
it
fades
body
is
a
thin
blackness
that
shows
the
carbonation
on
the
body
of
the
glass
nose
is
attractive
with
roasty
malt
and
hints
of
nutty
toffee
and
minerals
you
get
a
slight
tangy
sour
on
the
tongue
up
front
this
is
not
harsh
though
this
quickly
yeilds
to
a
nutty
malt
that
paints
the
mouth
fully
has
a
nice
thickness
due
to
the
sour
start
and
the
malty
balance
extremely
drinkable
well
balanced
refresher
very
drinkable
drank
my
bottle
and
still
wanted
more
d
what
is
black
obi
soba
anyway
is
this
really
a
fruitvegetable
beer
rogues
website
says
soba
is
buckwheat
which
is
really
a
fruit
and
not
a
grain
hmm
it
tastes
and
smells
like
a
grain
to
me
at
least
in
beer
form
so
dont
go
expecting
a
fruity
beer
for
this
one
anyhow
this
is
not
a
favorite
of
mine
and
i
doubt
i
will
be
revisiting
just
a
touch
too
roasted
and
dry
without
more
redeeming
qualities
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
smells
of
roasted
malts
slightly
fruity
and
smells
very
good
taste
is
mainly
of
roasted
malts
slightly
nutty
with
a
slight
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
this
was
a
very
good
beer
but
rogue
definitley
has
better
offerings
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
strange
beer
because
nothing
stands
out
and
its
hard
to
put
your
thumb
on
why
its
good
but
i
like
it
and
could
definitely
pound
a
few
of
these
down
in
a
session
d
a
mellow
easily
quaffable
brew
i
appreciated
the
dark
soba
elements
but
they
dont
really
take
the
spotlight
a
dry
ale
taste
is
the
major
factor
with
smooth
creamy
wheat
tastes
i
would
give
it
another
go
a
decent
beer
nice
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
nice
chocolate
malt
and
buckwheat
smell
taste
is
better
than
the
regular
obi
while
this
beer
is
dark
it
is
very
smooth
and
light
you
know
what
i
mean
very
easy
beer
to
drink
a
nice
beer
in
the
fall
very
light
and
thirst
quenching
one
of
the
few
dark
beers
i
can
say
that
about
this
beer
poured
a
thick
black
with
a
nice
light
tan
head

tight
bubbles
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
malty
it
has
a
roasted
taste
that
is
balanced
by
a
molasses
like
sweetness
there
is
a
refreshing
spice
that
adds
a
little
extra
in
this
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
short
of
chewy
this
is
an
interesting
beer
which
id
consider
quite
drinkable
its
not
the
most
refreshing
but
its
certainly
an
interesting
take
i
would
have
to
take
this
one
over
the
signature
buckwheat
ale
in
most
circumstances
its
unassertive
enough
to
pair
nicely
with
a
lot
of
foods
just
beware
the
aftertaste
and
keep
around
some
water
this
beer
pours
very
dark
with
a
slight
brown
tint
and
a
light
head
the
settles
into
a
good
lace
it
has
a
toasted
fruity
smell
that
fills
the
senses
the
beer
has
a
smoky
roasted
coffee
flavor
that
settles
into
a
chocolate
tone
it
has
a
creamy
fell
what
goes
down
smooth
it
finishes
heavy
with
a
hops
after
taste
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
smooth
quality
me
likey
would
buy
it
again
to
drink
with
a
teriyaki
steak
or
maybe
some
roast
duck
almost
black
with
some
ruby
notes
around
the
edge
creamy
head
that
dosnt
hold
as
long
as
i
would
like
smell
of
roasted
malts
but
i
also
picked
up
some
distinct
cascade
hops
grapefruit
in
the
first
wiff
the
roasted
flavor
takes
over
and
pushes
the
hops
out
of
the
picture
some
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
but
that
isnt
exactly
a
bad
thing
there
is
so
much
flavor
in
this
beer
that
it
stays
interesting
all
the
way
through
fruitvegetable
beer
dosnt
really
give
you
a
feel
for
what
this
beer
is
i
would
describe
it
as
a
scotch
ale
nice
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
to
try
22
oz
bottle
into
snifter
a
very
dark
a
light
head
that
died
down
fairly
quick
s
roasted
malts
soy
sauce
very
light
hops
hints
of
coffee
t
surprisingly
light
black
tea
mixed
with
buckwheat
bitter
finish
m
fairly
thin
and
smooth
not
much
carbonation
d
overall
its
a
really
interesting
beer
not
my
favorite
rogue
offering
but
unique
enough
that
its
definitely
worth
a
try
this
one
starts
out
complex
but
quickly
fades
in
flavor
its
similar
to
a
porter
but
a
little
lighter
worth
a
try
di
could
have
alot
of
these
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
right
up
my
alley
this
makes
a
perfect
pairing
for
a
rich
piece
of
meat
pours
out
of
a
22oz
bomber
bottle
into
my
sly
fox
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
chestnut
brown
that
allows
very
little
light
pass
through
head
is
about
two
fingers
deep
and
light
tan
in
color
smells
of
roasted
tree
nuts
and
sweet
caramel
tastes
of
roasted
nuts
molasses
and
pungent
bitter
citrus
fruit
quite
rich
in
the
mouth
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
this
was
a
really
unique
beer
for
me
at
least
and
one
that
i
would
revisit
on
occasion
this
brew
pours
quite
nicely
theres
a
lot
of
co2
here
which
produces
a
nice
light
tan
head
that
lasts
almost
to
the
end
from
a
22oz
bomber
this
is
very
dark
and
pretty
much
looks
like
a
porter
it
smells
like
one
too
roasted
malts
but
i
detect
a
small
grape
like
aroma
tastes
pretty
much
like
a
porter
to
me
this
is
full
bodied
but
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
finishes
a
little
powdery
d
not
bad
a
fairly
straight
forward
beer
goes
down
really
easy
though
very
different
for
me
to
drink
but
goodim
glad
i
tried
it
good
solid
brew

not
there

i
did

what
to

and
am
pleasantly
suprised
the
body
is

and
creamy
very
good
light
carbonation
has
an
odd
dry
diacetyl
finish
with
a
lingering
taste
of
buckwheat
could
be
better
but
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
actually
enjoyed
it
compared
to
the
sobabuckwheat
ale
drinkability
not
a
beer
i
plan
on
buying
again
but
i
wouldnt

buy
it
either

this
would
be
a
nice

to
the
night

tiny

very
faint

finish
is

big

bitter
lasts
a

overall
this
beer
is
interesting
the
taste
is
unique
as
there
is
a
sweet
and
lightly
sour
feel
that
clings
all
the
way
through
the
tasting
session
the
rest
is
kind
of
bland
and
usual
though
drinkability
too
busy
for
my
palate
but
intersting
nontheless
i
wont
have
this
again
unless
its
paired
with
the
perfect
food

black
with
red
highlights
and
a
light

as
well
with

smooth

with
a
zesty

bomber
is
gone
quickly
another
excellent
beer
out
of
the
morimoto
line
maybe
more
drinkable
than
the
regular
soba
ale
because
this
ones
more
like
beer
an
interesting
light
change
of
pace
d
an
easy
beer
to
drink
due
to
its
fairly
low
abv
and
crisp
character
i
like
this

like
towards
the
end
good
beer
but
was
expecting
more
i
picked
this
15th
anniversary
beer
up
at
the
kclingers
public
house
before
it
closed
awhile
back
the
beer
poured
a
deep
dense
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
very
thick
and
bubbly
head
that
lasted
for
awhile
and
finally
gave
way
to
a
tan
swirly
layer
over
the
dense
body
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
toasted
has
a
touch
of
coffee
maybe
the
taste
is
a
more
intense
toasted
malt
taste
with
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
backend
to
round
things
out
nicely
the
body
is
medium
and
there
is
a
good
lingering
bitterness
on
the
tough
another
solid
rogue
brew
drinkability
not
so
sessionable
to
me
but
a
cool
one
for
a
beer
tasting
dwas
another
good
brew
from
rogue
they
have
yet
to
let
me
down
cheers
very
dark
clear
rubychestnut
colour
with
a
short
cap
of
dark
tan
head
decent
retention
with
a
bit
of
stickage
as
well
aromas
of
light
powdery
hops
and
a
nutty
chocolatey
caramel
malt
sweetness
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
and
hop
flavour
with
a
burnt
malt
character
thats
a
little
too
strong
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
thats
more
prominent
towards
the
finish
as
is
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
with
a
slightly
creamy
texture
and
plenty
of
roasted
dryness
interesting
and
well
brewed
but
just
a
little
dull
mouthfeel
crisp
as
well
as
a
little
creamy
and
herbal
the
soba
brings
new
flavors
to
the
table
for
what
looks
like
an
average
german
beer
but
its
not
pours
dull
blackdark
brown
with
a
tan
head
smells
basically
just
like
a
schwarzbier
but
slightly
more
fruity
in
the
yeast
dept
taste
is
pretty
much
similar
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
but
with
a
little
somethinge
extra
that
a
schwarz
wouldnt
usually
have
and
thats
most
likely
ale
yeast
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
overall
i
think
i
liked
the
regular
morimoto
soba
beer
better
but
this
was
fair
as
well
sometime
ill
breakdown
and
buy
the
imperial
pilsner
because
the
rest
of
his
line
has
turned
out
decent
on
the
other
hand
now
that
ive
had
this
one
i
doubt
ill
buy
it
again
3

22
oz
lithographed
bottle
overall
this
beer
is
classified
as
a
fruitvegitable
beer
by
ba
but
it
presents
more
like
a
moderate
to
mild
stout
definitely
worth
a
try
and
definitely
a
conversationstimulating
brew
drinkability
just
isnt
this
beers
strong
suit
there
is
a
harshness
to
the
flavor
from
too
much
charred
malt
this
is
distinctly
burned
in
flavor
and
much
closer
to
a
porter
or
stout
than
anything
else
a
beer
i
cant
recommend
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
will
definately
pick
it
up
again
in
some
ways
it
reminded
me
of
a
really
good
black
tan
drinks
okay
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
few
not
complex
enough
to
hold
my
attention
all
night
or
day
as
the
case
may
be
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
sobe
ale
i
tried
by
far
slick
but
not
oily
finishes
clean
and
leaves
nothing
behind
this
is
almost
like
a
porter
save
for
the
eathiness
in
the
taste
good
beer
but
i
doubt
id
buy
it
again
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
i
have
had
that
really
didnt
taste
like
anything
it
wasnt
bad
it
wasnt
good
it
was
just
there
kinda
like
an
irish
dry
stout
except
with
out
the
minimal
flavor
to
this
beer
i
say
huh
i
guess
that
means
its
kinda
interesting
in
its
own
sorta
way
but
then
again
this
is
me
talkin
after
three
bombers
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
a
little
thin
and
drinkability
is
high
pretty
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
rogues
that
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
slick
and
wet
barely
watery
with
a
drying
finish
drinkable
for
the
style
to
be
sure
but
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
a
unique
beer
to
be
sure
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
taste
or
mouthfeel
others
that
have
more
of
an
appreciation
for
vegetables
may
enjoy
this
more
now
that
i
think
of
it
it
kinda
reminds
me
of
abita
turbodog
a
medium
bodied
brew
smooth
but
with
a
slightly
watery
and
clean
finish
sadly
wanted
this
one
to
linger
on
the
palate
a
bit
a
good
brew
that
at
least
gets
better
as
it
warms
black
obi
is
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
large
tan
head
head
is
fairly
creamy
and
thick
aroma
is
sweet
and
nutty
almost
nutmeglike
actually
atop
a
roasted
malt
body
flavor
is
dominated
by
a
smoth
nutty
flavor
similar
to
hazelnut
with
an
edge
of
caramel
malt
base
is
sweet
and
lightly
roasted
with
a
vague
chocolate
flavor
in
the
mix
as
well
overall
flavor
is
just
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
this
to
be
truly
great
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
definently
kick
back
with
this
again
i
think
texas
now
has
the
entire
rogue
morimoto
line
except
for
the
imp
pilsner
too
bad
thats
the
one
i
most
want
to
try
pours
out
a
dark
black
with
quite
a
lot
of
bubbles
coating
the
side
of
the
glass
modest
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
good
nutty
roasted
breadlike
aroma
very
coffeeish
flavor
lots
of
roast
grain
and
a
subtle
sweetness
offset
by
the
roast
malt
and
light
bitterness
finishes
with
a
lingering
toasty
lightly
caramel
flavor
the
body
seems
a
little
thin
and
watery
though
it
has
a
bit
of
chewiness
this
rogue
offering
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
meduim
tan
head
it
smells
nutty
and
grainy
with
just
a
bit
of
stinging
acidity
the
flavor
is
really
strong
on
the
nutty
side
i
dont
know
if
its
the
yeast
or
the
soba
but
it
is
quite
nutty
smooth
but
a
bit
watery
and
the
body
really
doesnt
help
this
beer
at
all
a
slight
dextrin
like
sweetness
emerges
on
top
of
the
nutty
flavors
a
bit
of
citrus
come
in
along
with
some
vegetal
flavors
a
spicy
high
alpha
acid
finish
cleans
out
this
rather
unremarkable
rogue
offering
its
decent
and
drinkable
but
not
worth
the
money
imo
this
is
an
interesting
ale
packed
in
a
brown
bomber
with
japanese
characters
and
named
after
a
famous
chef
morimoto
black
obi
soba
ale
pours
nearly
black
with
a
medium
sized
offwhite
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
side
the
aroma
is
very
grainy
like
fresh
baked
multigrain
bread
though
a
touch
sweet
very
nutty
flavor
with
sweetness
at
the
start
that
moves
to
more
savior
notes
with
a
touch
of
soy
sauce
in
the
middle
and
finishes
dryer
and
with
some
spice
light
mouthfeel
but
perhaps
lighter
and
less
round
than
expected
the
first
sip
or
two
might
be
a
surprise
as
this
is
a
unique
beer
but
it
is
very
drinkable
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
when
you
consider
the
brewery
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
red
almost
black
color
with
a
small
light
brown
head
that
leaves
little
lacing
in
my
glass
light
grain
and
wheat
aromas
taste
of
wheat
bread
not
much
flavor
kind
of
bland
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
watery
mouthfeel
finishes
a
bit
sweet
i
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
not
really
knowing
what
to
expect
and
yet
i
was
fairly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
pours
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
highlights
it
smells
pretty
good
but
the
taste
really
came
as
a
surprise
it
is
not
a
typical
rogue
ale
that
is
all
about
the
hop
this
tasted
more
like
a
traditional
porter
except
rather
than
having
a
creamy
consistency
it
was
more
of
a
sparkling
type
of
carbonation
i
liked
this
beerand
i
would
say
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
typical
of
the
rogue
line
a
pleasant
and
safe
beer
although
the
lable
and
packaging
promised
more
smells
mildly
and
sweetly
roasty
with
a
light
smooth
roundness
looks
like
coca
cola
perhaps
a
bit
darker
and
with
much
better
carbonation
and
head
retention
tastes
pleasantly
roasty
moderately
sweet
and
mildly
spicy
light
alcohols
persist
into
the
finish
feels
smooth
and
refreshingly
light
to
the
palate
finishes
a
bit
airy
for
a
dark
roasted
beer
though
nice
and
without
flaws
it
falls
a
little
lackluster
drinkability
overall
a
beer
you
need
only
to
try
once
and
thats
it
this
is
something
i
wanted
to
try
since
i
watch
alot
of
iron
chef
and
after
drinking
this
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
sorry
this
isnt
one
of
rogues
best
products
i
have
to
say
this
is
uncharacteristic
for
rogue
who
knows
maybe
morimoto
had
to
much
input
into
this
beer
because
when
rogue
makes
their
own
beers
they
are
phenominal
im
going
to
blame
this
average
offering
on
the
chef
and
move
on
drinkability
nice
and
flavorful
but
very
easy
to
drink
perhaps
a
tad
too
sweet
on
its
own
but
great
with
a
meal
much
better
than
the
littlebrother
morimoto
soba
version
poured
black
with
a
mocha
head
roasted
malt
aroma
very
stoutlike
up
front
with
lots
of
roasted
malt
flavors
an
interesting
interplay
of
malts
and
the
soba
producing
an
odd
finish
i
kept
thinking
that
this
reminded
me
very
much
of
another
beer
but
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
finally
it
dawned
on
me
how
much
this
beer
was
like
anchors
our
special
ale
without
the
spices
or
spruce
as
with
osa
something
interesting
but
not
something
i
want
a
lot
of
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
not
really
a
regular
rotation
kind
of
thing
but
i
can
see
being
in
the
mood
for
this
one
of
the
more
interesting
concoctions
ive
come
across
in
a
while
worth
a
try
pours
a
deep
dark
amber
with
a
rocky
crackling
khaki
head
smells
of
mild
hop
spiciness
with
roasted
and
slightly
chocolatey
malt
initially
hits
with
gentle
hops
followed
by
a
dry
roasted
malt
in
the
middle
finishing
with
a
nutty
hop
crispness
slightly
astringent
and
almost
salty
medium
body
drying
mouthfeel
not
that
impressive
but
perhaps
pairing
it
with
the
right
foods
will
make
it
standout
an
okay
beer
i
wont
be
returning
unless
it
is
free
yo
black
obi
the
wide
belt
on
a
kimono
soba
ale
is
a
better
beer
than
its
lighter
counterpart
the
roasting
of
the
buckwheat
brings
out
flavors
that
are
preferable
to
the
unroasted
fruit
and
the
different
malt
and
hop
bills
are
more
to
my
liking
as
well
it
doesnt
quite
make
it
over
the
hump
called
recommended
but
im
still
glad
this
is
a
bomber
unusual
beer
very
much
brings
rhubarb
or
chickory
to
my
mind
an
acidity
and
sourness
remain
but
it
does
ease
as
it
warms
find
a
bottle
with
a
good
price
then
try
some
but
dont
spend
too
much
on
this
one
bottle
courtesy
of
okbeer
poured
a
pitchblack
ale
with
a
medium
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
bitter
hops
with
some
strange
spice
that
i
dont
think
i
have
encountered
in
beer
before
taste
is
a
mix
between
the
roasted
malt
bitter
hops
and
this
strange
spice
body
is
too
thin
and
carbonation
is
very
low
this
is
not
bad
but
nothing
extraordinary
either
id
still
go
with
the
mocha
porter
any
day
thought
i
quite
liked
this
beer
one
that
grows
on
ya
a
fine
drinker
and
taster
perhaps
not
the
complete
knock
out
that
it
could
be
but
for
what
it
is
its
about
right
and
pretty
solid
fairly
complex
brew
but
fairly
easy
to
drink
id
like
another
bottle
to
review
it
again
i
think
the
beer
pours
into
a
pint
glass
leaving
a
small
eggshellcolored
head
to
contrast
with
the
otherwise
black
body
of
the
beer
this
bad
boy
is
almost
opaque
but
when
held
up
to
the
flourescent
light
in
my
room
a
dark
maroon
hint
shines
through
the
beer
smells
bitter
and
sweet
which
is
not
to
be
confused
with
bittersweet
that
is
something
totally
different
burnt
malts
lay
the
ground
work
for
the
flavor
supporting
the
sugary
beginning
bready
buckwheat
middle
and
hoppy
finish
the
hops
and
the
sugar
stick
on
the
toung
for
5
or
8
seconds
after
the
swallow
i
dont
know
much
about
sobas
but
this
beer
is
a
bit
thin
for
the
flavor
that
said
i
think
this
is
a
well
crafted
beer
and
a
fitting
addition
to
the
morimoto
signiture
series
a
drinkable
beer
but
no
much
flavor
really
a
little
thin
in
that
area
not
one
that
particularly
impressed
me
or
will
have
me
out
searching
for
it
again
phreds
black
soba
has
a
delightfully
eccentric
taste
it
is
sweet
and
strangely
herbal
as
though
spiced
with
licorice
root
with
an
undercurrent
of
dried
fruits
the
head
fades
quickly
and
the
lace
is
infrequent
but
it
earns
an
enthusiastic
recommendation
to
any
adventuresome
beer
hunter
the
beer
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
awesome
it
has
a
sweet
crystal
malt
scent
with
a
nutty
accent
there
are
some
hops
present
but
the
overall
aroma
is
dominated
with
nuts
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
great
as
well
it
has
a
roasted
coffeelike
flavor
that
is
sweet
but
with
an
earthy
nutty
edge
there
is
a
bit
of
tanginess
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
it
has
a
delicious
aroma
followed
by
an
enjoyable
taste
a
good
drinker
a
black
pour
accentuated
by
red
at
the
edges
smells
nutty
with
a
prominent
roasted
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
pretty
mellow
hoppy
bitterness
edged
by
malt
sweetness
there
is
an
overall
nuttiness
that
almost
gives
it
a
brown
ale
quality
nothing
fancy
here
seems
like
just
another
oppurtunity
for
rogue
to
push
the
gourmet
morimoto
line
worth
a
try
beer
pours
a
dark
coffee
color
with
a
beautiful
tan
head
that
pours
to
a
2
inch
thick
head
lacing
will
coat
the
glass
the
smell
is
mysterious
you
will
find
the
usuall
hints
of
roasted
malts
and
caramel
hues
found
in
darker
beers
but
the
light
berry
fruit
and
citrus
hop
came
as
a
pleasant
suprise
the
taste
is
light
enough
to
still
drink
in
the
heat
of
summer
the
roasted
malts
and
perfectly
blended
with
the
light
smooth
side
of
this
beer
perfect
for
your
bbq
in
the
late
summer
evenings
perfect
after
getting
through
the
initial
slightly
burnt
taste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
limited
to
the
tolerance
of
the
fading
burnt
aftertaste
the
beer
is
smooth
and
somewhat
creamy
subtle
is
the
best
word
i
can
use
to
describe
this
beer
not
overpowering
and
really
not
as
flavorful
as
i
had
hoped
light
body
with
excessively
large
bubbles
lending
to
a
fuller
mouthfeel
watery
palate
almost
as
bad
as
the
regular
soba
alw
does
anyone
actually
like
this
i
cant
see
anyone
buying
this
more
than
once
pretty
good
and
quite
interesting
for
something
so
straightforward
pours
a
dark
ruby
color
with
a
huge
head
lots
of
longevity
and
tremendous
lace
smells
of
a
rich
medium
roasted
malt
that
has
some
slight
butter
and
nutty
smells
taste
is
quite
nice
a
fine
roasted
malt
flavor
similar
to
a
nice
porter
but
nuttier
and
creamier
give
this
one
a
try
taste
is
nutty
and
rich
not
unlike
a
nice
fullbodied
english
nut
brown
ale
sweetish
brown
malt
buckwheat
flavors
take
hold
in
the
finish
lending
a
grainy
bitterness
to
it
some
hops
in
there
too
to
round
it
out
rich
and
fullbodied
yet
crisp
and
kind
of
refreshing

slight

for

a
solid
aroma
that
had
a
bit
of
depth
to
it
nutty
roasted
malt
flavors
started
this
one
off
with
a
mild
dark
chocolate
in
the
background
caramel
sweetness
and
a
light
bitterness
rounded
out
the
flavor
bitter
sweet
roasty
finish
about
medium
and
fairly
smooth
going
down
good
drinkability
as
there
is
a
bit
of
depth
to
both
the
taste
and
smell
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
roasty
another
good
brew
from
rogue
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
red
it
has
a
small
brown
head
that
fades
very
quickly
leaving
very
few
laces
it
has
a
malty
sweet
aroma
to
it
it
smells
coffee
like
with
a
slightly
nutty
aroma
also
it
has
very
little
hop
aroma
it
tastes
malty
but
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
i
was
expecting
it
has
a
chocolate
taste
to
it
the
hops
make
an
appearance
in
the
taste
slightly
this
beer
is
rather
dry
it
is
sort
of
hard
to
drink
because
of
how
dry
it
is
it
makes
my
mouth
feel
a
little
weird
i
really
cant
explain
how
just
a
little
off
it
is
overcarbonated
it
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
would
probably
make
a
bad
session
beer
although
it
is
low
in
alcohol
the
aggressive
dry
taste
might
be
undesirable
to
some
i
doubt
i
will
have
the
desire
to
drink
this
one
again
if
you
see
it
maybe
you
should
buy
a
different
type
like
the
haselnut
brown
nector
pretty
complex
aroma
balanced
between
malt
and
a
little
floralfruit
nose
the
taste
is
incredibly
balanced
between
malt
and
hops
with
a
crisp
citrus
stampeding
through
at
the
finish
its
a
very
clean
finish
too
for
a
darker
colored
brew
drinkability
is
good
of
course
how
many
of
these
22
oz
bottles
can
one
realistically
put
away
poures
a
near
pitch
black
but
not
for
the
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
with
a
big
fluffy
off
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
nicelywow
a
real
cascade
presence
in
the
aroma
wich
was
entirely
unexpected
due
to
the
fact
well
it
is
roguea
nice
roastiness
also
shows
itself
nicely
slick
mouthfeel
to
this
slides
down
with
easeinteresting
melding
of
flavors
firmly
nutty
with
some
roasted
malt
as
the
core
but
there
is
very
much
a
pw
hop
presence
not
so
pronounced
but
it
lets
itself
be
known
very
interesting
and
flavorful
ale
i
will
be
sure
to
grabe
more
ive
been
intrigued
with
the
morimoto
line
of
rogue
beers
and
buy
them
whenever
ive
come
across
them
i
love
a
good
gimic
and
good
beer
so
walk
away
from
the
experience
a
winner
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
the
bitter
chocolate
tones
linger
into
the
aftertaste
overall
a
different
tasting
brew
but
one
22
oz
bottle
was
enough
to
enjoy
this
is
far
and
away
the
least
distinguished
rogue
brew
ive
had
pours
into
the
pint
glass
a
dark
dark
ruby
black
big
foamy
head
lacing
and
falls
to
a
table
of
beige
bubbles
nose
is
toasted
bread
and
malt
some
alcohol
soaked
sugars
taste
is
chocolate
hop
bitterness
and
what
must
be
the
soba
flavor
like
a
japanese
noodle
bowl
not
my
thing
the
finish
is
an
annoying
bitterness
that
lingers
far
past
its
welcome
other
than
that
this
is
relatively
watery
beer
its
ok
the
beer
emerges
from
the
22ounce
brown
bottle
a
deep
raspberry
color
with
a
stupendous
frothy
light
tan
head
that
linger
long
after
its
eventual
demise
the
resultant
lace
forms
a
thick
and
sticky
skirt
to
surround
the
glass
nose
has
a
nice
toasted
grain
aroma
with
a
sweet
nutlike
tone
fresh
and
clean
a
hint
of
caramel
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
decent
grain
profile
top
is
light
to
medium
in
feel
finish
is
benign
in
its
acidity
the
hops
spicy
and
the
aftertaste
somewhat
dry
with
a
bit
of
residual
bitterness
a
drinkable
beer
light
bodied
good
carbonation
with
a
very
wet
refreshing
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
a
malt
that
is
rich
but
isnt
particularly
toasty
alot
of
hops
flavors
come
across
this
brew
is
nothing
if
not
interesting
im
sure
i
would
drink
it
again
sometime
dark
clear
ruby
one
finger
sized
brown
head
very
creamy
looking
and
long
lasting
lace
is
better
than
average
nice
thick
aroma
its
got
chocolate
roast
and
char
but
also
fruit
and
hop
tones
like
currants
and
peach
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
and
lends
a
good
drinkability
to
the
whole
equation
body
is
about
medium
the
flavor
is
chock
full
of
goodies
rich
chocolate
and
coffee
tones
on
the
palate
blend
with
the
weird
but
nice
soba
accents
and
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
adds
the
final
punch
nice
combination
and
quite
refreshing
as
well
pours
dark
not
quite
black
but
close
dark
roasty
malts
are
the
most
notable
elements
of
the
aroma
slightly
nutty
with
hints
of
caramel
flavor
is
nutty
and
malty
as
well
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
balance
roasty
toasty
and
yummy
with
a
nicely
lingering
aftertaste
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
enthralling
by
any
means
not

it

kinda

ale
with
a
twang
initially
the
carbonation
is
tingly
but
becomes
smoother
by
the
end
of
the
bomber
its
good
but
for
the
money
ill
go
for
something
better
a
unique
style
with
a
good
delivery
i
really
liked
this
one
but
i
have
always
enjoyed
the
original
buckwheat
ale
this
is
very
similar
but
more
brash
unrefined
and
punchier
good
stuff
overall
hmmmm
listed
as
a
fruitvegetable
beerbut
i
couldnt
help
feel
that
this
tasted
and
drank
a
little
like
a
below
average
dark
mild
not
bad
but
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
again
if
i
see
it
very
average
and
bloody
boring

i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
who
enjoys
dark
beer
or
beers
that
are
bold
and
innovative
quite
tasty
indeed
big
roasty
presence
keeps
this
going
especially
when
paired
with
the
fine
hop
bitterness
a
very
easy
drinker
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
reminding
me
at
times
of
a
mix
between
guinness
export
stout
rogues
morimoto
soba
ale
it
has
that
sharp
burnt
caramel
bitterness
of
the
guinness
and
the
medium
body
hoppy
intensity
and
residual
sugars
of
the
soba
at
any
rate
this
is
a
really
good
beer
but
i
think
i
could
only
finish
one
of
these
bombers
at
a
time
good
stuff
john
id
have
this
beer
again
and
if
i
can
find
it
for
the
label
price
5
29bomber
i
will
certainly
go
for
it
had
this
on
tap
at
rich
os
public
house
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
hints
of
roasted
malts
but
it
was
very
subdued
the
flavor
was
a
bit
weak
too
reminded
me
a
lot
of
the
standard
buckwheat
ale
that
rogue
makes
but
with
a
bit
more
roastiness
a
nice
beer
overall
but
seemed
a
bit
thin
and
weak
in
the
flavor
great
flavor
but
it
could
use
more
if
it
sampled
at
richos
last
night
the
beer
came
off
the
tap
a
nice
dark
brown
with
just
some
ruby
hues
at
the
edges
to
let
me
know
its
not
black
one
finger
of
tan
head
sat
atop
the
beer
throughout
the
drink
the
nose
was
a
little
hard
to
dissect
being
a
touch
weak
but
i
got
a
nice
roasted
character
with
a
slight
coffee
as
well
the
flavor
was
also
only
slightly
roasty
wtih
a
really
nice
caramel
sweet
base
and
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
finish
the
feel
was
a
touch
thin
for
my
liking
but
very
smooth
and
easy
to
consume
this
was
another
nice
offerng
from
rogue
a
good
way
to
start
the
night
had
this
ontap
at
the
public
house
in
san
fran
another
treat
provided
by
my
buddy
tony
from
oregon
bringing
back
rogue
treats
as
a
wedding
present
with
warmth
some
doughiness
comes
out
but
still
that
piercing
black
medicinal
taste
interestingly
off
drinkability

i
enjoyed
this
offering
from
rogue
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
vegetable
it
was
supposed
to
be
though
i
saw
it
as
a
nice
lowabv
very
drinkable
dark
ale
this
is
a
very
interesting
ale
to
say
the
least
i
had
this
one
with
a
few
friends
in
philadelphia
this
ale
was
a
dark
blackbrown
colour
with
ruby
edges
the
aroma
was
interesting
although
it
was
reminiscent
of
the
regular
soba
ale
it
also
had
some
roasted
notes
and
some
chocolate
tones
the
smell
also
had
an
odd
aroma
that
i
can
not
describe
this
particular
aroma
kind
of
ruined
the
smell
of
this
beer
for
me
although
the
smell
was
not
my
favorite
this
beer
tasted
awesome
fruity
roasted
and
very
stoutlike
at
times
with
plenty
of
fruit
notes
as
well
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
but
perhaps
a
bit
thin
and
the
drinkability
was
nice
an
interesting
one
from
rogue
a
nice
quaffable
anniversary
beer
from
rogue
will
not
be
around
again
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
though
a
good
session
beer
indeed
and
i
would
have
drank
these
all
night
but
i
just
had
to
have
a
few
more
pints
of
the
smoke
ale
i
said
solid
already
so
nother
good
one
rogue
mmmmm
it
also
had
that
almost
complely
unique
rogue
hoppiness
which
also
rounded
out
the
flavor
overall
its
pretty
good

with
desert

o
i
will
never
drink
this
beer
again
there
are
lots
of
nice
flavours
present
but
the
licorice
like
bitterness
ruins
this
beer
for
me
i
am
barely
able
to
taste
anything
in
the
beer
but
this
licorice
taste
this
is
without
a
doubt
due
to
my
absolute
hate
for
black
licorice
otherwise
i
think
this
could
be
a
good
beer
its
a
shame
i
wasnt
able
to
enjoy
the
other
flavours
worth
a
try
for
sure
if
you
think
youll
enjoy
that
taste
overall
this
is
a
really
really
good
black
ipa
with
a
solid
almost
stout
base
beer
actually
this
is
pretty
much
a
very
very
hoppy
stout
with
more
than
enough
bitterness
to
satisfy
any
craving
something
i
was
very
happy
to
drink
and
would
gladly
drink
again
if
the
lcbo
gets
more
next
year
recommended
overall
a
rather
decent
black
ipa
but
nothing
all
that
exceptional
overall
a
nice
one
to
try
but
really
not
worth
the
added
price
of
the
bomber
or
on
tap
in
comparison
to
some
of
the
other
black
ipas
out
there
in
12
ozers
nice
chocolate
smell
o
just
an
average
beer
lacks
any
real
flavour
depth
and
the
dry
bitter
finish
it
not
for
me
tasteherbal
earthy
hops
roasted
malt
coffee
and
pine
wellbalanced
and
nicely
suited
to
a
grilled
burger
or
bbq
pork
that
being
said
dads
little
helper
offers
more
of
a
superficial
glimpse
than
it
does
a
master
class
on
the
style
while
thoroughly
enjoyable
there
are
to
be
sure
more
formidable
examples
out
there
those
new
to
the
style
however
are
encouraged
to
cut
their
teeth
on
this
rogue
rarely
does
any
wrong
and
this
offering
is
up
to
their
usual
solid
serviceable
standards

a

b
dads
little
helper
black
ipa
is
a
solid
brew
with
a
yummy
malt
backbone
that
should
sit
well
with
most
stoutporter
fans
despite
being
quite
bitter
the
hops
dont
really
seem
to
contribute
many
other
flavours
to
this
one
which
is
a
little
disappointing
for
a
black
ipa
from
the
west
coast
this
would
make
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
and
theres
no
disputing
that
its
a
wellmade
beer
but
aspects
of
this
one
still
leave
me
wanting
worth
a
shot
but
not
a
worldbeater
the
taste
has
a
malt
character
but
it
is
more
like
licorice
or
molasses
muted
sweetness
the
finish
is
a
tad
bitter
but
not
over
the
top
as
far
as
black
ipas
go
it
is
alright
but
i
am
not
blown
away
mf
creamy
with
a
dry
finish

a

o
didnt
really
like
the
first
sip
let
this
one
breathe
and
strike
when
it
is
a
little
warmer
not
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
black
ipa
more
along
the
lines
of
a
ridiculously
hopped
dopplebock
not
my
fave
in
the
style
but
not
bad
at
all
either
overall
i
like
the
fathers
day
theme
and
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
would
recommend
everyone
try
it
at
least
once
pretty
tasty
beer
and
a
bit
different
from
other
black
ipas
ive
had
again
it
tastes
more
like
a
hoppierthanusual
stout
than
a
black
ipa
still
not
a
bad
price
at
all
and
its
a
pretty
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
the
style
this
style
is
just
not
appealing
to
me
personally
ive
had
some
beers
brewed
with
chocolate
and
that
worked
but
the
coffee
taste
and
roasted
malt
taste
does
not
work
for
me
food
match
this
is
definitely
an
ale
for
the
next
cigar
society
meeting
which
i
am
not
affiliated
with
nor
do
i
acknowledge
the
existence
of
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
citrus
zest
weed
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
there
is
a
definite
weed
aspect
i
am
getting
in
the
aroma
o
i
have
had
some
delicious
beers
from
rouge
this
was
enjoyable
but
nothing
besides
the
appearance
really
stood
out
for
me
i
found
the
smell
to
be
mild
the
taste
to
not
be
all
that
complex
and
it
had
a
fairly
strong
bitter
and
dry
aftertaste
which
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
o
4
its
alright
the
bottle
rocks
harder
than
the
beer
cool
name
id
love
to
taste
it
with
wookey
jack
and
see
how
the
two
compare
bought
for
fathers
day
but
just
opened
today
when
i
found
out
i
was
going
to
be
a
father
to
a
daughter
appearance
is
a
black
appearance
with
a
slight
red
hint
in
the
light
creamy
thin
layer
of
retention
with
good
lacing
on
the
side
aromas
were
rich
in
malts
with
a
slight
chocolate
maybe
coffeeish
flavor
taste
is
a
bitter
with
a
roasty
malt
flavor
the
drink
has
a
good
crisp
medium
body
with
a
creamy
texture
overall
a
great
celebratory
beverage
for
a
great
day
in
my
family
overall
solid
aba
here
by
rogue
i
feel
the
bitterness
could
be
lightened
up
a
bit
and
this
beer
could
be
more
enjoyable
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
pretty
good
not
my
favorite
style
but
still
very
good
for
the
style
o
i
really
like
this
beer
one
of
the
first
black
ipas
i
actually
enjoyed
drinking
back
in
the
day
if
i
were
to
nitpick
i
wish
the
black
malt
was
smoother
d
this
was
an
ok
black
ipa
but
the
scent
and
taste
werent
overly
delicious
the
body
was
excellent
and
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
nothing
unique
or
exceptional
about
this
brew
but
not
bad
thanks
to
kirk
for
the
beer
the
smell
brings
pine
hops
on
top
a
short
but
present
dark
malt
background
malt
is
stronger
in
the
taste
but
all
the
same
basic
flavors
are
there
this
is
is
quite
drinkable
and
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
pleasing
overall
drinkability
while
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
malt
backbone
to
counter
the
hops
the
beer
works
nicely
the
beer
needs
some
stronger
flavors
to
pair
with
in
regards
to
food
i
tried
chicken
schnitzel
but
it
clashed
a
bit
i
think
the
recommendation
on
the
bottle
of
beef
or
lamb
would
have
been
right
the
beer
definitely
needs
to
warm
up
a
bit
before
drinking
though
when
first
poured
and
still
fairly
cold
its
more
bitter
than
anything
else
and
the
other
flavors
get
lost
after
warming
up
all
of
the
flavors
come
out
and
that
chlorine
smell
goes
away
in
the
end
a
good
beer
but
not
sure
id
buy
again
as
for
drinkability
i
found
that
i
drank
it
up
fairly
quickly
but
i
was
sated
after
completing
the
whole
bottle
i
did
not
want
another
pours
a
pitch
black
hue
i
cant
believe
it
doesnt
have
black
patent
malt
extremely
light
tan
head
forms
thick
and
dwindles
slowly
fat
chunky
lacing
spans
the
sides
of
my
chalice
aroma
herbal
earthy
with
a
kick
of
resinous
pine
the
chinooks
really
do
complement
the
dark
black
ipa
quite
well
its
in
line
with
the
troegs
porter
that
packs
loads
of
chinook
flavors
are
dark
bitterness
from
the
roasted
barley
and
massive
hop
additions
i
get
bitter
dark
chcocolate
and
loads
of
pine
sap
and
other
assorted
hop
resins
at
92
ibus
this
is
definitely
an
ipa
coats
the
palate
with
the
bitterness
aspects
of
the
hop
mouthfeel
finishes
each
sip
with
a
lingering
bitterness
medium
bodied
smooth
natural
carbonation
going
strong
keeps
each
sip
worthy
of
the
next
overall
an
impressive
black
ipa
a
nice
transition
from
the
malt
liquor
formerly
known
as
dads
little
helper
its
a
good
brew
its
a
different
kind
of
bitter
more
roasty
bitter
than
hop
bitter
but
still
has
some
nice
flavor
solid
brew
but
better
black
ipas
are
out
there
overall
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
ipas
i
am
developing
a
taste
for
black
ipas
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
just
enough
hops
to
fit
the
style
but
not
so
much
to
suck
all
the
moisture
out
of
your
face
overall
enjoying
this
one
sitting
out
on
main
street
with
my
nachos
not
the
best
but
a
plenty
enjoyable
beer
overall
knowing
rogues
ability
to
nail
complex
malt
profiles
balanced
by
a
strong
hop
presence
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
one
the
generic
cocoa
flavored
malt
profile
underwhelmed
me
odd
considering
the
use
of
5
different
malts
and
though
a
bit
of
redemption
was
found
in
the
strong
citrus
hop
finish
the
general
impression
i
have
of
this
beer
leaves
me
wanting
simply
the
malt
is
too
sweet
and
a
roast
touch
nonexistent
the
flavor
especially
that
sweet
cocoa
reminds
me
a
quite
bit
of
moylans
orange
and
black
congrats
except
this
finds
balance
in
the
bitter
hop
back
end
for
the
price
i
think
ill
pass
on
giving
this
another
go
id
say
this
is
one
of
rogues
lazier
efforts
thus
far
kinda
one
of
those
where
youre
not
quite
sure
what
the
brewer
is
getting
at
not
outright
bad
just
muddled
kinda
makes
me
wonder
if
this
was
a
rush
replacement
for
the
original
for
sales
reasons
not
buying
again
but
your
mileage
may
vary
tasty
and
solid
all
the
way
around
a
good
punch
of
flavor
in
a
great
drinking
package
damn
tasty
damn
enjoyable
i
will
be
looking
for
this
one
again
this
just
tastes
like
charred
grain
and
utterly
bitter
hops
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
jubilation
fine
wines
in
albuquerque
not
so
much
of
an
ipa
poured
form
a
bomber
into
a
glass
thin
headlasted
but
thinned
out
very
little
lacing
black
appearancein
the
direct
light
it
has
a
root
beerish
like
look
opaque
rather
than
translucent
sweet
aromas
with
some
light
caramel
and
chocolate
some
fruitiness
taste
is
again
sweet
chocolate
is
what
i
got
right
off
and
brief
tart
pine
like
taste
again
accentuated
by
what
seems
herbals
aroma
was
more
malty
than
hoppy
this
is
not
an
ipa
mouthful
was
creamy
and
smooth
easy
at
the
beginning
and
lasted
a
while
in
the
back
part
of
the
tongue
it
was
not
at
all
offensive
bottle
pours
mostly
clear
and
dark
brown
with
a
large
creamy
offwhite
head
fantastic
retention
the
aroma
is
of
milk
chocolate
and
caramel
no
real
hop
craziness
here
fullbodied
with
a
milky
mouthfeel
and
modest
carbonation
the
flavor
provides
a
lot
of
unsweetened
dark
cocoa
and
charcoal
but
not
much
hop
bitterness
until
the
fairly
bitter
dark
chocolate
finish
interesting
combination
but
did
it
really
become
a
good
one
much
hops
weak
body
o
outstanding
beer
this
is
a
black
ale
with
a
great
hop
bitterness
not
an
ipa
a
black
ale
thats
the
only
thing
i
have
against
this
beer
the
label
the
ipa
thing
is
a
huge
fad
right
now
and
a
great
moneymaker
but
this
is
no
ipa
maybe
the
best
dark
grains
i
have
ever
tasted
overall
this
is
not
complex
but
it
is
very
flavorful
a
rather
disappointing
beer
rather
disjointed
as
far
as
everything
pulling
together
the
appearance
is
the
best
thing
but
the
taste
especially
doesnt
live
up
to
the
promise
a
bit
more
malt
presence
to
tonedown
the
alcohol
notes
would
be
nice
some
decent
hop
aroma
also
would
be
a
plus
taste
wise
its
got
mostly
a
dry
coffee
flavor
full
in
body
very
dry
to
the
palate
and
slightly
warm
in
the
end
solid
allaround
this
version
of
a
black
ipa
embraces
the
roasted
malt
aspect
of
the
style
equally
with
the
hops
malt
was
not
as
dense
or
roasted
as
the
hoppy
porters
known
back
in
the
old
days
as
robust
porter
but
more
malt
backbone
than
a
hoppy
brown
ale
hops
were
appropriately
assertive
and
true
to
its
name
nice
head
and
hangs
around
well
ipa
smell
is
not
immediately
present
and
is
masked
by
the
malt
taste
is
pleasing
with
a
good
amount
of
malt
balancing
the
beer
hops
are
harder
to
detect
solid
beer
and
even
pleased

54this
is
a
very
nice
beer
looks
like
a
thin
black
lager
smells
like
a
double
ipa
and
tastes
like
a
pure
black
ipa
it
is
a
keeper
for
me
best
black
ipa
anywhere
absolutely
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
like
taking
a
great
black
lager
and
blending
it
perfectly
with
an
extremely
high
quality
ipa
awesome
one
of
those
that
got
me
moving
away
from
40s
a
few
years
ago
higrav
flavorful
with
rich
suggestions
of
chocolatey
biscuit
behind
a
pleasantly
bittering
hop
profile
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
within
a
week
of
bottling
it
can
in
some
locations
have
a
low
turnover
on
the
shelves
22oz
bomber
this
one
pours
a
dark
chocolate
brown
color
there
was
about
a
finger
of
a
tan
head
on
it
that
didnt
linger
long
it
has
a
surprisingly
lighter
nose
malts
but
not
much
sweetness
at
all
perhaps
a
bit
of
chocolate
roast
and
pine
it
tastes
ok
but
im
not
sure
why
they
call
it
a
black
ipa
almost
no
bitterness
to
it
there
is
a
good
malt
body
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
notes
trying
to
peak
thru
but
no
real
sweetness
either
it
needs
a
whole
lot
more
hops
to
be
in
an
ipa
category
lets
just
call
it
a
very
good
strong
porter
overall
a
pleasant
sweetness
balanced
by
a
touch
of
smoke
and
slightly
burnt
malts
light
in
general
but
good
and
refreshing
dark
ipa
supposedly
a
black
ipa
but
i
wouldnt
even
call
it
a
cda
this
is
more
like
a
baltic
porter
lots
of
tar
piny
bitterness
soya
sauce
black
strap
molasses
and
hints
of
bitter
orange
rind
old
rasputin
comes
to
mind
along
with
the
tan
head
id
say
theres
more
than
just
carafa
here
probably
some
black
patent
malt
it
really
misses
the
style
and
would
probably
benefit
from
some
age
a
decent
aba
one
led
by
the
malt
and
feeding
us
the
neutered
hops
in
small
doses
here
and
there
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
certainly
hits
the
spot
after
more
than
4
hours
on
snowy
icy
roads
o
i
like
porters
and
i
like
pale
ales
that
arent
too
bitter
so
this
is
a
nice
interplay
the
bitterness
def
tastes
like
a
chinnock
or
centennial
so
it
is
pretty
strong
but
the
malt
balances
it
out
i
would
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
next
time
both
because
of
the
complexity
mixed
with
high
abv
and
i
like
that
it
is
organic
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
packs
in
the
key
elements
of
the
aba
style
o
not
a
bad
beer
and
it
makes
for
a
perfect
transition
into
the
fall
season
i
have
found
beers
by
peak
to
be
a
bit
thin
and
lacking
flavor
in
the
past
but
that
can
hardly
be
a
complaint
for
hop
noir
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
this
some
night
under
the
stars
with
friends
around
a
fire
and
a
bite
in
the
air
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
poured
a
dark
black
with
a
small
brown
head
smells
of
dark
malt
and
coffee
and
raisins
tastes
of
earthy
hops
and
coffee
beer
is
medium
bodied
carbonated
nicely
great
finish
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
not
the
best
bipa
ive
had
but
a
good
beer
anyway
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
and
candied
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
slightly
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
solid
easy
drinking
black
ipa
o
i
now
know
what
peak
beer
to
get
when
in
doubt
i
have
been
underwhelmed
by
them
in
the
past
but
this
one
is
certainly
something
to
brag
about
find
it
and
enjoy
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
it
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
very
sweet
and
not
much
bitterness
for
an
ipa
but
still
drinkable
i
really
liked
this
beer
it
wasnt
perfect
but
it
was
complex
and
well
put
together
the
hoppyness
wasnt
overbearing
nor
did
it
fatigue
the
palate
but
it
had
depth
and
was
multilayered
much
the
same
can
be
said
about
the
malt
i
was
impressed
also
with
how
drinkable
such
a
complex
offering
could
be
any
fan
of
black
ipas
should
definitely
give
this
a
try
oa
well
balanced
black
ipa
with
heavy
roasted
and
pine
flavor
not
my
favor
version
of
the
style
but
not
a
bad
brew
one
of
the
better
versions
of
the
style
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
his
style
because
they
tend
to
be
so
far
out
of
balance
a
brewer
who
shows
restraint
and
creativity
and
purpose
with
their
recipe
nice
brew
ill
have
this
again
high
quality
black
ipa
definitely
recommend
it
o
a
pretty
good
beer
the
dark
aspects
come
out
a
lot
more
than
the
ipa
i
wouldve
liked
to
see
a
little
bit
more
complex
ipa
character
in
this
one
overall
quite
a
step
up
from
their
regular
ipa
it
seems
more
balanced
with
a
black
malt
profile
worth
checking
out
o
this
beer
improves
as
it
warms
but
a
good
hoppy
ale
doesnt
run
from
the
cold
o
pretty
plain
and
somewhat
bland
black
ale
very
little
hoppiness
i
blame
the
possible
age
on
the
bottle
having
said
that
they
didnt
bother
to
bottle
date
so
theres
no
way
to
know
anyway
i
will
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
regardless
its
pretty
middleoftheroad
d
a
solid
offering
will
be
exploring
this
brewery
further
best
at
a
warmer
temp
very
disappointed
in
this
one
i
like
peaks
other
beers
and
i
love
the
black
ipa
style
this
tasted
like
a
stout
or
maybe
a
coffee
stout
no
cascade
finish
no
crispness
despite
the
dark
color
nothing
if
it
had
been
labelled
correctly
as
a
stout
i
still
wouldnt
have
been
that
impressed
lots
of
dark
toasted
malt
flavor
up
front
theres
a
decent
hop
kicker
this
creates
a
very
good
balance
rich
body
with
a
high
carbonation
that
tantalizes
long
dark
aftertaste
of
strongly
caramelized
sugars
and
puckering
bitter
hop
o
too
onedimensional
and
leaning
towards
the
heavily
roastedcharred
malt
flavors
not
undrinkable
for
me
i
like
a
nice
roasty
porter
for
instance
but
i
could
see
how
others
may
feel
differently
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
i
dont
know
if
its
an
everyday
drinker
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
meh
dark
nearly
black
color
topped
by
a
creamy
tan
ring
of
a
head
fruity
hop
stickiness
in
the
nose
with
some
sweet
coffee
and
resin
juicy
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavor
upfront
followed
by
moderate
sweet
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
fruity
and
bitter
not
a
tremendous
amount
of
malt
character
but
enough
to
just
hit
the
style
medium
bodied
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
listed
at
8
2
as
it
felt
smaller
than
that
pretty
good
stuff
o
incredibly
well
balanced
between
the
bitterness
and
the
hop
notes
great
depth
i
feel
as
though
peak
has
really
been
stepping
up
their
game
lately
and
theyve
really
mastered
the
use
of
hops
across
the
board
this
is
my
second
go
round
with
a
black
ipa
also
known
as
an
american
black
ale
and
also
known
as
a
cascadian
dark
ale
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
dissipating
tan
head
it
smells
good
a
shot
in
the
dark
i
would
say
that
there
are
either
chinook
or
amarillo
hops
i
cannot
distinguish
between
the
two
perhaps
both
there
is
some
hop
funk
resin
and
maybe
some
grapefruit
i
am
getting
some
roasted
barley
wow
that
is
exactly
what
i
imagined
a
black
ipa
to
tastee
like
thhere
is
a
lot
of
chocolate
and
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
the
last
black
ipa
i
tried
tried
tasted
like
a
moderately
hopped
porter
a
lot
of
grapefruit
and
resinous
flavors
it
does
finish
a
bit
hot
but
i
do
not
mind
that
quality
seeing
as
though
i
can
taste
both
the
dark
elements
of
this
beer
the
dark
fruit
the
chocolate
and
the
ipa
qualities
of
this
beer
distinctly
i
consider
this
beer
a
success
and
i
am
quite
sure
i
used
those
semicolons
incorrectly
i
have
been
quite
happy
with
the
two
beer
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
this
one
was
a
wild
wonderful
ride
the
appearance
is
pitch
black
almost
intimidating
a
really
intriguiging
citrus
character
shines
in
the
nose
i
love
citra
hops
hops
hit
the
palate
first
followed
by
a
mix
of
smoke
black
and
malt
sweetness
this
is
a
very
unique
malt
profile
in
that
the
dark
roasted
flavors
and
the
sweet
malt
flavors
combine
for
a
wonderful
experience
the
citra
hops
ride
on
top
the
entire
time
bitter
but
the
right
amount
to
stand
up
to
the
malt
yum
o
overall
i
really
enjoyed
hop
noir
great
beer
o
i
would
try
a
bottle
but
skip
a
6pack
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
this
one
didnt
return
to
the
shelves
next
year
maybe
theyll
keep
the
name
but
ditch
the
mediocre
recipe
ive
seen
peak
shine
before

flavor
is

floral

chocolate
and
roasted

cone

medium

overall
a
very

beer
for
the
style
nice

character
and
strength
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
head
that
quickly
drops
the
aroma
is
fairly
big
its
got
some
syrupy
roasted
malts
and
strong
citrus
and
tropical
hops
the
big
aromas
from
the
nose
kinda
cancel
each
other
out
when
it
comes
to
the
tasting
making
this
just
a
bitter
hoppy
black
ale
as
opposed
to
the
separation
of
flavors
i
got
on
the
nose
it
tastes
good
but
its
really
a
onenote
kind
of
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
rocky
but
it
works
and
the
drinkability
is
good
its
a
bit
of
a
strange
black
ale
but
i
think
it
works
this
is
a
fine
example
of
this
newer
style
of
beer
im
glad
its
brewed
localy
which
is
the
main
reason
i
purchased
it
but
i
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
peaks
regular
ipa
dont
try
downing
it
in
large
quantities
your
tastebuds
will
get
rocked
this
feels
like
a
sipping
beer
and
that
8
2
abv
is
no
joke
o
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
it
balances
the
flavor
well
and
the
hops
are
nice
im
not
blown
away
but
its
tasty
o
the
alcohol
which
is
no
lightweight
by
any
stretch
is
very
well
hidden
making
this
beer
quite
easy
to
drink
a
little
too
high
in
alcohol
for
me
to
claim
as
a
sessionable
beer
it
is
certainly
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
that
i
enjoyed
i
would
also
like
to
enjoy
this
one
again
noir
would
best
describe
the
blackness
that
lurks
beneath
a
tan
head
pine
hops
assault
my
nasal
passage
in
an
aroma
that
most
reminds
me
of
a
freshly
roasted
and
slightly
burnt
smore
a
big
dose
of
pungent
herbal
pine
flavored
hop
bitterness
works
its
way
around
the
palate
with
a
solid
roasted
malt
body
to
complement
o
a
very
solid
black
ipa
it
would
be
right
up
there
with
blue
point
toxic
sludge
and
stone
selfrighteous
if
the
mouthfeel
was
imporved
good
beer
nonetheless
and
had
a
bit
of
chocolate
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
which
was
very
complimentary
props
to
breakfast
on
the
front
and
back
ends
but
that
bitterness
in
the
middle
is
simply
too
much
the
body
is
nice
and
light
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
solid
brew
here
not
sure
how
fresh
it
is
right
now
but
pretty
tasty
either
way
does
organic
mean
diacetyl
im
not
up
on
the
hippy
lingo
of
politically
correct
eating
this
beer
tastes
like
buttered
popcorn
i
didnt
even
finish
my
sampler
id
rather
have
more
of
that
horrible
dipa
from
lost
rhino
than
this
disaster
any
longer
next
overall
im
not
sure
about
this
beer
i
like
what
it
was
trying
to
do
but
not
sure
if
its
for
me
overall
a
little
funky
in
the
aroma
but
overall
a
tasty
assertive
black
ipa
i
think
its
better
than
my
numbers
will
indicate
o
its
a
good
brew
for
the
most
part
probably
come
back
to
o
the
flavor
isnt
without
its
flawsits
burnt
coffee
flavor
was
a
bit
heavybut
over
all
quite
tasty
i
enjoyed
it
and
its
pine
scent
is
seductive
not
sure
id
buy
another
6er
maybe
just
another
to
see
if
it
is
any
different
boo
on
tap
pours
a
dark

color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
light
brown
head
lots
of
lacing
aroma
is
chocolatey
and
hoppy
sweet
floral
and
citrus
hop
aromas
some
caramel
taste
is
of
chocolate
and
floral
hops
nicely
bitter
sweet
not
really
much
citrus
like
in
the
nose
creamy
mouthfeel
floral
hop
finish
this
is
a
pretty
solid
black
ipa
worth
having
again
for
certain
o
good
black
ipa
still
hoppy
after
6
months
pretty
tasty
overall
a
better
flavor
than
aroma
pretty
nice
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
not
bad
but
could
use
more
malt
body
the
hops
are
good
and
vibrant
overall
not
remotely
enjoyable
avoid
but
at
least
its
organic
right
an
interesting
beer
but
not
very
robust
flavor
or
nose
makes
it
easy
to
drink
but
bordering
on
uninteresting
o
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
really
enjoy
this
the
strong
malt
presence
is
great
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tumbler
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
a
strong
thick
dense
one
inch
milk
chocolate
colored
head
looks
intense
with
a
great
cling
on
the
glass
aromas
of
molasses
sweetness
coffee
bitter
and
roast
and
wet
resinous
hops
good
strong
nose
flavors
are
very
strong
and
forward
on
the
tongue
with
a
dark
fruit
sweetness
and
molasses
robustness
the
hops
presence
follows
quickly
cleaning
everything
up
with
a
drying
and
pungent
bitterness
with
lots
of
wet
green
characters
the
aftertaste
is
almost
all
coffee
both
in
roast
and
bitterness
there
is
a
resiny
and
midlinger
finish
to
the
brew
that
slowly
dries
in
mouth
until
it
is
clean
and
clear
very
strong
flavors
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
presence
throughout
make
this
a
sipper
but
a
good
one
very
tasty
brew
would
like
to
see
it
in
six
packs
instead
of
just
bombers
tasting
more
and
more
black
ipas
these
days
and
would
have
to
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
walks
that
fine
line
of
too
much
going
on
too
many
bitter
acrid
flavors
but
this
one
was
very
enjoyable
glad
to
have
the
chance
to
try
peak
organic

noir
is
a
brownish
black
ale
with
a
brown
sugar
colored
head
thats
smooth
and
dense
lasts
forever
and
covers
the
glass
with
solid
sheets
of
foam
it
has
a
bold
citrus
aroma
that
is
a
lot
like
mandarin
orange
or
tangerine
there
is
a
hint
of
roast
to
it
like
coffee
its
pretty
full
bodied
smooth
and
foamy
the
finish
is
pretty
dry
and
a
little
acidic
it
leaves
the
teeth
feeling
a
little
gritty
it
has
a
pretty
bold
flavor
thats
quite
bitter
and
a
little
sweet
flavors
of
mandarin
orange
toffee
dark
chocolate
and
pine
resin
mingle
through
the
taste
both
the
citrus
flavor
and
the
roasty
almost
ashy
flavor
linger
well
after
the
swallow
this
is
pretty
richly
flavored
so
its
not
really
for
chugging
but
i
dont
let
that
stop
me
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
these
guys
did
a
good
job
with
it

dont

it
before

i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
from
a
black
ipa
ive
had
a
few
different
black
beers
before
and
ive
had
many
different
ipas
never
together
and
now
i
know
why
best
way
i
can
describe
this
is
burnt
citrus
unappetizing
for
me
literally
one
of
the
only
beers
ive
not
been
able
to
finish
and
found
its
way
down
the
drain
im
glad
it
was
just
part
of
the
4way
ipa
variety
pack
i
bought
and
not
a
6
pack
of
just
this
sort
of
an
ipaporter
hybrid
very
mild
hop
and
malt
aroma
dark
red
cola
color
hoppy
fruity
and
bitter
malt
is
way
overshadowed
by
the
hops
aftertaste
fades
quickly
for
the
ibu
level
not
bad
but
would
probably
only
drink
this
when
i
am
also
eating
something
to
contrast
the
hops
overall
i
feel
some
of
the
reviews
for
this
are
not
fit
the
style
i
think
sn
did
a
great
job
for
the
style
let
it
warm
and
see
the
difference
i
could
even
see
the
name
changing
to
strictly
blindfold
black
ale
let
the
consumer
decide
what
this
is
complex
and
tasty
nonetheless
good
stuff
pours
like
a
lumberjacks
coffee
with
champion
grade
lacing
roasted
malts
and
earthy
aroma
hops
come
through
the
nose
and
the
palate
strong
heavy
creamy
mouthfeel
not
bad
this
is
a
very
good
beer
will
drink
again
overall
a
good
representative
of
the
style
a
little
more
bitter
than
im
accustomed
but
a
tasty
and
complex
black
ipa
nice
taste
not
add
hoppy
as
i
thought
it
would
be
definite
repeater
overall
love
it
i
am
a
black
ipa
fan
hope
this
becomes
available
yearround
in
its
own
6ers
thanks
sierra
love
the
way
the
hops
go
with
the
roasted
malt
this
beer
is
a
winner
for
me
poured
a
bit
hard
with
a
11
beerhead
ratio
at
around
45
degrees
f
into
a
pint
mug
head
dissipates
so
slow
leaving
huge
beautiful
chunks
of
lacing
all
the
way
around
dark
brown
with
burgundy
around
the
edges
sort
of
looks
like
a
porter
until
the
smell
smells
of
cascade
hops
west
coast
style
sierra
nevada
standard
like
a
dark
torpedo
scent
in
a
way
deep
and
dark
molasses
and
hops
hit
the
nose
with
a
mixed
dank
mustiness
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
makes
it
seem
fuller
than
it
really
is
bitter
quite
dank
and
tasty
but
not
very
sweet
west

hops
dark

lingering
aftertaste
sort
of
like
campfire

as
it
warms
the
charred
chocolate
campfire
treats
and
signature
cascade
hop
bitterness
lingers
ever
more
if
only
all
beers
could
taste
this
good
trick
i
think
with
this
one
is
to
let
the
aromatics
out
with
a
rough
pour
at
just
below
50
degrees
f
kind
of
tones
down
the
acidity
while
enhancing
the
natural
flavor
intriguing
mix
of
stout
and
ipa
luckily
its
the
best
of
both
worlds
and
not
the
worst
the
ipa
is
definataly
the
predominant
style
very
deep
chocolateblack
color
nice
tan
head
and
great
lacing
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
relatively
light
with
some
malt
and
light
citrus
taste
is
hop
forward
with
some
malt
sweetness
and
a
nice
roasted
coffee
bitterness
that
lingers
for
a
while
overall
feels
good
tastes
good
and
is
pretty
well
balanced
translucent
deep
brown
as
it
pours
in
to
the
new
belgium
tulip
impenetrably
black
once
it
collects
in
the
glass
remarkable
3
finger
head
of
coffee
colored
foam
that
settles
gradually
in
to
a
resilient
layer
leaving
impressive
lacing
all
the
way
around
this
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
robust
imperial
stout
based
on
the
appearance
alone
chocolate
and
coffee
bean
aromas
mingle
with
a
fresh
leafy
hop
bouquet
toasted
biscuit
notes
give
the
scent
some
depth
smoky
roasted
coffee
bitterness
bounces
off
of
spicy
herbal
hop
notes
creating
an
artful
exposition
of
flavor
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and
minty
pine
come
together
in
the
finish
to
give
the
subtle
impression
of
a
peppermint
patty
medium
bodied
with
creamy
active
carbonation
that
really
plays
up
the
roasty
bite
perhaps
a
little
slick
for
such
a
dark
foreboding
brew
but
executed
well
nonetheless
the
pithy
zing
clings
to
your
palate
with
a
cumulative
effect
reminding
you
that
its
definitely
an
ipa
a
little
booziness
on
the
breath
also
lets
you
know
that
its
a
sturdy
brew
the
combined
bitterness
of
the
burnt
malts
and
assertive
hops
yield
an
aspirinlike
quality
thats
surely
not
for
everyone
but
for
me
this
was
pretty
divine
another
win
for
sierra
nevada
and
beer
drinkers
the
country
over
so
glad
they
have
expanded
east
a
fine
black
ipa
seems
to
have
good
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
just
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
double
shot
of
bitterness
that
black
ipas
provide
exactly
how
it
is
billed
and
exactly
what
you
would
expect
deep
brown
color
classic
sn
head
retention
and
feel
nice
roasty
flavor
that
finishes
with
a
flourish
of
hops
very
clean
finish
actually
a
bit
softer
than
normal
very
nice
beer
o
a
decent
well
made
black
ipa
that
doesnt
try
to
overdo
any
particular
aspect
overall
almost
reminded
me
of
a
slightly
hoppy
porter
this
was
just
a
ok
beer
nothing
special
not
overly
smitten
with
the
style
either
overall
probably
one
of
the
more
balanced
black
ipas
not
a
very
good
black
ipa
not
much
carbonation
or
flavors
taste
like
black
coffee
wouldnt
recommend
it
not
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
ever
had
but
another
solid
offering
from
sn
pours
black
with
a
brown
head
that
lasts
aroma
is
hop
bitterness
and
slight
roast
malts
taste
is
light
citrus
and
bitterness
with
roasted
tones
and
a
hint
of
coffee
mouthfeel
is
medium
overall
this
is
a
great
black
ipa
with
lots
of
roast
and
bitterness
looks
like
a
stout
drinks
like
a
roasted
ipa
o
this
is
a
nice
compliment
to
a
mix
pack
but
not
something
that
could
stand
out
on
its
own
not
quite
black
deep
mahoghany
would
be
a
better
description
with
a
tan
head
nice
lacing
rye
aroma
blended
with
mild
herbal
hops
flavor
is
rye
like
but
maltier
than
hoppy
but
bitters
remain
present
smoother
than
a
standard
ipa
but
still
nicely
carbonated
with
a
bit
of
bite
black
ipas
are
very
hitormiss
with
me
and
this
one
is
a
miss
the
weakest
of
the
4way
ipa
pack
in
my
opinion
very
harsh
bitterness
but
relatively
little
hop
flavor
big
roasted
malts
overpower
im
rarely
disappointed
with

its
happening

in

this
is
a

it

i
give
it

b
a

with

it
gave
off
a

went

had

not

easy
to

and
hoppy
enough
to
fit
in
with
the

it
was
a
good

from

and
one
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
have
again
o
i
am
so

the

as

this

just
like
a

almost
black
with
a
massive

excellent
the

medium
body
with
a
slick
texture
that
is
almost
creamy
below
normal
carbonation
with
no
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
unique
flavor
profile
is
quite
nice
balanced
and
complex
it
begins
with
citrus
hop
then
flows
to
pine
over
a
light
chocolate
sweetness
bitterness
follows
that
is
citric
rind
in
nature
over
a
very
light
smoke
from
the
roast
very
well
balanced
so
each
component
is
evident
but
not
over
powering
the
smooth
finish

you
with
a
lingering
citric

with
a
chocolate
note
an
outstanding
example
of
the
style
smc
overall
i
must
confess
i
do
not
like
the
black
ipa
style
i
did
however
enjoy
this
beer
the
roasted
notes
in
this
style
are
usually
too
pronounced
for
my
liking
but
this
beer
was
pleasantly
roasted
in
an
understated
way
the
hop
profile
was
like
a
nice
traditional
ipa
should
be
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
sierra
nevada
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
the
beers
are
excellent
and
reasonably
priced
taste
profile
than
other
black
ipas
but
once
adjusted
to
found
to
be
an
enjoyable
and
so
far
unique
offering
of
the
style
overall
a

a

with

a

a

slightly
drying

quite

very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
american
black
ale
it
has
the
nice
hybrid
of
stout
and
ipa
in
its
aroma
and
taste
and
combines
it
with
a
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
a
good
experiment
that
is
worth
trying
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
roasty
toasty
malt
taking
the
front
with
a
burnt
bitterness
finish
the
pine
adds
in
another
layer
of

is

and
gives

its
sierra
nevada
doing
a
take
on
a
black
ipa
errr
american
black
ale
its
good
and
worth
drinking
if
nothing
else
o
perfect
blend
of
hops
and
flavor
but
i
would
appreciate
a
heavier
beer
but
i
guess
that
would
be
more
of
a
stout
than
what
this
is
the
flavor
profile
is
outstanding
had
while
at
a
local
grill
pub
with
family
the
first
thing
youll
notice
is
the
bright
hop
aromas
enimating
from
the
glass
its
not
clear
if
they
used
fresh
hops
but
the
smell
is
comparable
to
sns
annual
celebration
seasonal
pours
a
deep
dark
black
hue
that
lives
up
to
its
namesake
little
to
no
head
present
even
with
a
moderately
aggressive
pour
as
for
the
taste
well
the
smell
builds
up
a
lot
of
hype
but
the
taste
is
purely
middleoftheroad
ipa
fruity
piney
hops
and
plenty
of
bitterness
and
not
much
else
the
deep
abyssal
black
hue
of
the
brew
and
the
special
roasted
malts
ultimately
dont
matter
as
the
bitterness
overpowers
any
semblance
of
a
malt
profile
from
start
to
finish
its
a
decently
thick
drink
close
to
stout
levels
of
creaminess
and
finishes
clean
with
nothing
lingering
on
the
palate
it
is
an
interesting
little
experiment
and
i
want
to
see
where
they
can
take
it
but
until
they
find
out
how
to
keep
the
hop
flavour
and
cut
the
overaggressive
hop
bite
ill
have
to
pass
on
any
future
iterations
of
blindfold
and
its
derivitives
overall
nice
black
ale
it
seems
the
smokey
malt
flavor
and
bitterness
is
a
bit
overpowering
of
the
hop
flavor
it
still
is
an
enjoyable
beer
though
beer
tasted
better
as
it
warmed
too
o
a
pretty
solid
black
ipa
especially
for
1
per
bottle
part
of
the
4way
ipa
variety
pack
this
beer
is
masterfully
made
please
make
no
mistakes
about
that
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
per
se
its
very
dark
but
surprisingly
smooth
for
those
of
you
that
are
concerned
about
that
aspect
of
darker
beers
a
noteworthy
amount
of
people
prefer
not
to
chew
on
the
their
beers
and
thats
what
comes
to
mind
with
darker
beers
but
i
digress
the
beer
is
pretty
fantastic
its
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
because
for
whatever
reason
ive
never
preferred
darker
beers
could
be
because
of
their
consistency
and
overall
texture
i
will
say
that
this
beer
might
go
fantastic
with
mesquite
smoked
bbq
if
anybody
tries
that
combo
let
me
know
the
flavor
of
the
beer
tends
to
be
slightly
sweet
but
also
full
of
roasted
dark
malts
and
slightly
more
biting
bitterness
that
the
aroma
might
indicate
a
better
than
average
black
ipa
overall
this
is
one
of
the
more
quaffable
american
black
ales
out
there
i
would
say
i
feel
like
its
been
brewed
for
drinkability
rather
than
extremity
as
so
many
beers
of
the
style
seem
to
be
i
rather
like
it
o
i
have
nothing
negative
to
say
about
it
blindfold
is
an
excellent
black
ipa

taste
was
great
i
have
had
black
ipas
that
i
thought
were
just
like
normal
ipas
but
colored
different
this
was
not
the
case
the
dark
malt
really
gave
a
strong
roastytoasty
flavor
to
the
ale
subtle
coffee
notes
and
roasted
chocolate
were
in
there
too
the
roasted
flavor
was
over
a
sweet
malt
flavor
that
led
into
the
sweet
grapefruit
floral
hops
and
a
classic
ipa
bitter
burst
at
the
end
good
carbonation
combine
with
a
more
fullbodied
ipa
then
is
the
norm
a
nice
combination
overall
a
wellbalanced
and
fun
ipa
not
your
everyday
ipa
but
a
real
treat
worth
seeking
out
for
a
night
time
drink
smells
of
dates
malt
iced
coffee
very
attractive
caramel
black
color
with
thin
white
bubbles
taste
is
wonderful
this
coming
from
someone
who
isnt
the
biggest
fan
of
black
ipas
neither
too
bitter
nor
too
sweet
moderate
aftertaste
not
unpleasant
this
is
a
dark
nearly
black
beer
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
the
head
is
tan
thick
and
longlived
the
smell
has
a
hint
of
malta
grain
and
generous
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
surprisingly
well
balanced
full
with
bitterness
relatively
dry
and
very
flavorful
creamy
and
full
in
body
nice
it
has
been
tried
before
by
others
but
ive
never
had
a
black
ipa
that
i
would
seek
out
again
this
is
the
exception
love
the
combo
classic
sn
on
the
hoop
character
i
think
this
is
where
the
others
miss
it
blends
ask
nicely
with
the
malt
smooth
finished
one
and
wanted
a
second
rare
in
my
book
overall
just
a
solid
black
ipa
from
these
guys
and
a
classic
solid
sierra
nevada
beer
taste
offers
more
malt
character
than
the
aroma
yet
doesnt
overdoe
it
either
touch
of
coffee
and
a
bit
of
milk
chocolate
and
thinnot
sweet
cherry
notes
on
the
finish
fit
well
with
a
surprising
lack
of
coarseness
of
bitterness
from
the
dark
malts
perhaps
debittered
in
nature
offers
a
good
carbonation
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
without
being
too
drying
on
the
palate
overall
i
like
this
for
the
style
yet
perhaps
in
part
because
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
oh
sierra
you
have
done
it
again
another
one
i
cant
breakdown
in
a
review
because
i
absolutely
love
this
offering
black
as
pitch
with
a
nice
tan
brown
head
which
leaves
a
great
lace
dark
roasted
chocolate
malty
goodness
with
a
wonderful
citrusy
finish
perfect
carbonation
easy
and
flavorful
to
drink
and
slightly
reminiscent
of
my
favorite
beer
ever
hop
rod
rye
i
hope
this
becomes
an
everyday
selection
as
this
beer
ranks
up
there
with
sierra
nevadas
best
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
havent
been
a
big
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
one
is
a
winner
and
worth
seeking
out
along
with
the
other
three
beers
in
this
4way
ipa
mix
pack
overall
a
very
solid
black
ipa
good
presence
of
both
hops
and
dark
roast
notes
serving
type
bottle
o
a
solid
black
ipa
interesting
coffeelike
flavors
mix
well
with
the
bitter
hops
drinks
well
overall
an
excellent
black
ipa
o
its
no
bad
i
tried
it
once
and
once
was
enough
i
wouldnt
really
recommend
it
mouthfeel
is
slightly
grainy
medium
bodied
not
sticky
overall
very
good
i
like
it
o
pretty
good
im
a
fan
an
escapee
from
beer
camp
this
not
particularly
flavorful
offering
just
doesnt
taste
very
good
the
flavor
and
texture
is
of
an
overroasted
weak
stout
albeit
the
age
may
have
reduced
the
hoppiness
and
allowed
the
over
roasted
malt
to
predominate
this
attractive
beer
is
dragged
down
by
its
flavor
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
definitely
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
pours
dark
cola
with
fluffy
light
coffee
head
aroma
of
light
coffee
cola
vegetation
roast
tastes
of
roast
vegetation
cola
dark
chocolate
bitterness
and
grass
high
carbonation
with
medium
body
balance
between
roast
and
hop
bitterness
is
played
with
quite
well
but
nothing
stands
out
as
really
good
about
this
beer
has
that
piney
citrus
feel
i
find
in
most
of
the
sn
ipas
but
this
time
with
a
nice
dose
of
dark
roasted
malts
to
form
a
base
clean
and
refreshing
i
knew
they
would
make
an
exceptional
ipa
not
sure
why
i
dont
buy
more
of
their
beer
why
the
hell
dont
they
have
a
sampler
case
its
what
pa
needs
overall
an
enjoyable
black
ipa
that
was
refreshing
and
satisfying
o
from
the
original
masters
of
the
hop
comes
this
late
black
ipa
bloomer
blindfold
as
with
the
majority
of
sierra
nevadas
beers
its
hoppy
its
also
very
well
done
the
hop
bite
and
flavor
adds
a
unique
twist
to
the
chocolaty
coffee
roasted
malt
profile
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
o
overall
it
isnt
bad
for
the
style
it
does
have
some
traits
that
would
probably
cause
it
to
fail
a
blindfolded
taste
test
happy
to
have
tried
it
but
im
glad
that
i
dont
have
an
entire
six
pack
of
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
brownhighlighted
blackish
coloring
with
a
thin
sparse
filmy
offwhite
surface
coat
of
head
aromas
of
roasted
coffee
in
the
backbone
with
tangy
citrus
notes
and
hints
of
resin
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
with
a
blast
of
bitter
and
roasted
coffee
traveling
across
the
palate
neck
and
neck
with
the
tangy
and
tart
citrus
notes
resinous
and
piney
characteristics
add
depth
to
the
flavors
too
the
beer
is
light
and
slightly
effervesced
in
mouth
bringing
a
quick
end
to
the
roasted
and
bitter
coffee
aftertaste
the
finish
is
fairly
quick
as
well
and
a
little
on
the
frothedeffervesced
side
and
a
slight
resinous
and
coffee
linger
interesting
brew
hope
sierra
nevada
makes
it
a
regular
offering
the
feel
allows
for
a
brightness
but
some
strong
support
from
the
malts
a
good
sturdy
crispness
and
level
carbonation
that
never
falls
off
it
flows
exceptionally
well
with
lots
of
creamy
smoothness
on
the
palate
from
start
to
finish
even
dry
and
woody
all
the
way
through
it
never
gives
up
depth
or
richness
it
takes
craft
to
mix
a
hoppy
ipa
with
a
caramel
malt
back
here
on
a
risk
sierra
nevada
has
succeeded
the
front
side
features
the
hops
the
backside
is
all
blackened
roast
without
too
much
burnt
taste
this
beer
is
a
winner
which
i
hope
will
be
featured
by
sn
more
often
in
retail
availability
like
hops
its
there
like
malt
its
there
very
few
beers
mix
these
successfully
this
one
does
sierra
nevada
has
dabbled
with
this
style
in
the
past
and
i
hope
they
return
to
it
i
like
the
approach
here
nothing
is
over
the
top
which
stops
this
from
smelling
like
someone
tried
to
torch
a
pile
of
grapefruit
peels
this
is
easy
drinking
and
id
have
another
overall
this
is
definitely
the
best
of
the
3
new
brews
introduced
in
this
package
easy
drinking
the
flavors
meld
well
together
nice
take
on
the
style
overall

this
is
a
brew
that
really
sneaks
up
on
the
imbiber
it
seems
trendy
goofy
whatever
but
there
is
a
real
depth
to
this
beer
that
far
outweighs
any
initial
reaction
one
might
have
to
it
the
best
example
of
this
style
that
i
have
tried
and
definitely
worth
an
investment
if
you
are
a
fan
of
stouts
and
are
wondering
what
the
black
ipa
is
like
poured
dark
black
with
thick
brown
foamy
head
has
an
average
amount
of
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
has
a
mildly
piney
roasted
caramel
smell
strong
roasted
malty
taste
up
front
can
discern
mainly
dark
chocolate
there
is
some
coffee
as
well
there
is
a
piney
bitter
taste
at
the
end
strong
bitter
aftertaste
that
persists
this
one
seems
to
fill
me
up
like
a
stout
would
very
good
black
ipa
d
i
wouldnt
mind
a
touch
more
hops
on
this
one
but
otherwise
i
dont
have
too
much
to
complain
about
here
a
well
made
beer
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
fuck
up
such
a
good
beer
awesome
black
ipa
here
the
best
of
both
worlds
we
sometimes
dont
give
sierra
nevada
enough
credit
yeah
they
are
huge
but
this
latest
four
way
ipa
box
is
evidence
that
they
are
among
the
best
in
the
world
especially
when
it
comes
to
hops
this
beer
is
coffee
black
and
has
some
of
that
similar
earthy
bitterness
on
the
front
end
its
light
and
airy
wispy
tan
head
is
similar
to
its
feel
also
very
delicate
and
fluffy
nice
on
the
tongue
and
subtle
or
a
beer
in
this
style
hops
are
citric
and
not
bitter
that
comes
from
the
grain
a
fun
complex
for
this
seemingly
sessionable
yet
nearly
7
abv
brew
its
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
rare
fillet
mignon
oscar
with
fresh
crab
hollandaise
sauce
and
wild
mushrooms
i
put
the
mushies
in
brandy
and
rosemary
and
with
this
beer
its
just
unfairly
tasty
a
food
driven
beer
for
sure
and
it
could
be
a
great
compliment
to
a
number
of
cool
dishes
has
me
inspired
but
tonight
it
was
first
fiddle
and
this
box
of
ipa
is
absolutely
sensational
overall
solid
good
beer
that
is
an
efficient
representation
of
the
style
could
be
more
innovative
but
i
dont
think
thats
what
sierra
nevada
is
going
for
with
this
beer
worth
a
try
and
i
would
definitely
buy
the
variety
pack
that
its
in
again
o
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
particularly
memorable
one
a
few
tweaks
to
the
recipe
to
balance
it
out
a
bit
would
make
it
better
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
pretty
standard
black
ipa
that
i
really
enjoyed
for
its
lack
of
over
the
top
hop
influence
though
it
was
still
present
and
accounted
for
i
would
drink
this
again
high
c
rjt
overall
this
is
a
great
black
ipa
not
overpoweringly
sweet
and
would
definitely
buy
again
came
in
a
sampler
12pack
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
16

nice

aroma
is
hoppy
floral
caramel
sweet
not

nothing
like

mild
dark

a

a

of
dark
chocolate
very
nice
but
a
bit
tame
mouthfeel
is
medium
a
bit
foamy
not
bubbly
or
over
carbonated
overall
this
is
very
good
but
not
quite
outstanding
to
me
an
interesting
and
refreshing
black
ipa
but
not
a
kick
in
the
head
or
a
really
memorable
flavor
experience
like
a
couple
other
black
ipas
i
have
had
this
is
a
good
wellbalanced
black
ipa
nice
hopped
tones
i
a
kind
of
oily
base
nothing
screaming
too
loudly
but
nothing
bland
by
any
means
just
a
well
done
version
of
the
style
i
could
go
for
numerous
of
these
in
a
sitting
hopefully
sn
keeps
this
around
for
a
while
overall
a
solid
darker
sweeter
ipa
good
roast
and
more
subtle
hop
flavors
im
not
really
feeling
this
one
at
all
its
just
not
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
to
me
id
love
to
see
sierra
nevada
brew
their
juniper
black
ale
again
nice
not
must
have
overall
a
solid
brew
all
around
im
happy
with
it
would
have
been
nicer
a
month
or
so
ago
when
it
was
colder
weather
and
i
was
craving
some
hops
it
is
a
good
way
to
get
in
a
darker
winter
brew
and
satisfy
a
hop
craving
better
drink
them
before
it
gets
too
warm
o
overall
pretty
good
but
not
great
probably
my
least
favorite
one
out
of
the
ew
variety
pack
definitely
worth
a
try
though
sierra
nevada
blindfold
black
ipa
3
55
overall
its
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
but
there
are
to
many
good
beers
out
there
for
me
to
buy
this
one
again
o
best
black
ipa
i
have
ever
sampled
and
its
not
even
close
i
found
the
hint
of
sweetness
in
the
malts
made
this
beer
sing
if
this
came
in
6
packs
id
be
buying
it
all
the
time
wow
this
really
comes
across
more
like
a
hoppy
stout
a
la
storm
king
the
hops
are
definitely
secondary
to
the
malts
it
is
a
very
hoppy
beer
but
the
hops
arent
presented
as
the
most
important
flavor
component
here
o
a
very
nice
black
ipa
with
a
great
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
the
roast
and
hoppy
bitterness
work
well
together
while
the
light
sweetness
rounds
everything
out
definitely
a
solid
brew
i
love
this
another
shocker
with
the
relatively
low
rating
though
the
look
is
great
deep
black
very
inviting
the
smell
is
roasted
malt
and
grapefruit
like
a
roasted
grapefruit
the
taste
is
delicious
in
the
same
way
if
not
more
so
i
wish
this
was
a
regular
offering

very

a
very
enjoyable

o

nothing
extraordinary
but
a
pleasant
tasting
balanced
beer
focusing
more
on
the
malts
than
this
still
definitely
has
the

appearance
was
a
smooth

with
a

of
white

smell
was
alchohal
coffee
and
piney

mouthfeel
was
medium

slightly
crisp
taste
was
strong
coffee
and
other
deep
malt
flavors
followed
by
a
wave
of
hoppy
bitterness
was
overall
an
interesting
experiance
but
the
combination
of
flavors
didnt
work
so
well
for
me
ok
but
not
exceptional
a
common
thing
with
black
ipas
overall
a
rather
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
nice
mix
of
hop
sweet
and
roast
that
creates
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
style
overall
this
is
really
good
relaly
ahs
a
onetwo
punch
of
a
ipa
and
a
porter
then
it
all
ties
in
together
to
create
a
black
ipa
smooth
flavorful
sweet
bitter
and
bold
has
it
all
id
buy
a
6er
of
this
for
sure
excellent
brew
great
black
ipa
from
sierra
nevada
i
had
the
beer
camp
version
this
might
be
a
step
better
because
of
its
approachability
o
a
black
ipa
that
is
both
satisfying
and
drinkable
as
good
as
it
gets
among
the
limited
releases
in
sns
ipa
box
but
not
on
par
with
topedo
o
if
the
alcohol
was
a
bit
more
toned
down
in
the
flavor
this
would
be
a
real
winner
instead
its
good
but
not
great
o
not
bad
at
all
the
flavor
of
an
ipa
stout
hybrid
and
the
feel
of
an
ipa
smooth
but
complex
powerful
and
balanced
i
just
really
like
it
overall
good
beer
bought
as
a
single
to
try
and
cannot
say
that
im
dissipointed
pours
almost
pitch
black
there
are
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
when
held
toward
the
light
light
tan
head
looks
kind
of
like
a
dry
irish
stout
in
the
glass
nice
full
thicket
of
head
with
chunky
textures
aroma
dark
roasted
malts
earthy
almost
mint
like
herbal
hop
qualities
it
also
has
a
nuttiness
thats
complementing
the
dark
roasted
malt
character
with
some
generic
ale
fruitiness
that
may
be
characteristic
of
the
hops
as
well
flavor
im
getting
more
of
that
nutty
character
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
call
me
crazy
but
im
experiencing
something
that
almost
comes
off
like
peanut
butter
for
a
minute
maybe
ive
drank
too
much
duclaw
sweet
baby
jesus
lately
but
thats
what
im
getting
even
though
i
know
thats
not
intended
i
think
its
some
interaction
between
the
roasted
malts
and
the
hop
character
here
caramelized
roasted
malts
dark
chocolate
edges
more
like
drinking
a
very
hoppy
porter
with
a
bit
more
malt
expression
than
your
average
dry
dark
roasted
malt
finish
the
bitterness
here
is
definitely
from
the
hop
varieties
used
a
very
good
sipping
beer
complex
herbalfruitycitrus
hop
edge
wrapped
in
dark
nutty
caramelized
malts
that
border
on
complex
iced
coffee
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
great
textures
on
the
palate
a
tad
oily
but
flowing
carbonation
clears
that
off
the
palate
quite
nicely
dry
herbaldark
roasted
malt
finish
overall
a
very
good
version
of
the
style
its
hard
to
come
by
a
good
black
ipa
i
hope
this
sampler
remains
available
for
awhile
i
could
picture
myself
needing
more
of
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
both
golden
and
ruby
edges
there
was
well
over
a
finger
of
fluffy
beige
head
that
lingered
on
and
on
and
finally
left
gorgeous
lace
rings
in
its
wake
the
nose
had
a
balanced
blend
of
roast
and
hops
there
was
little
balanced
about
the
flavor
profile
its
a
pinch
of
roast
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
the
body
is
hearty
even
though
this
is
more
on
the
ipa
side
of
the
world
of
black
ales
than
on
the
stout
side
overall
an
ok
black
ipa
with
lots
of
bitterness
but
its
very
acidic
and
not
well
balanced
o
sierra
nevada
makes
some
great
bar
beer
that
is
something
a
little
more
alcoholic
than
your
typical
session
brew
or
macro
but
without
an
intense
rich
palate
sometimes
those
monstrous
beers
are
good
but
a
lot
of
times
im
just
looking
for
a
beer
to
casually
drink
without
breaking
the
bank
and
without
getting
palate
fatigue
by
the
first
couple
of
bottles
this
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
tasty
bar
beer
in
other
words
im
glad
i
have
a
couple
more
bottles
in
the
12pack
overall
a
good
beer
if
a
black
ipa
straddles
the
space
between
an
ipa
and
a
stout
this
one
leans
more
towards
the
stout
side
after
trying
all
of
the
beers
out
of
the
4way
ipa
pack
this
one
is
definitely
my
favorite
hope
it
makes
a
stand
alone
release
the
verdict
very
good
a
well
blended
black
ipa
with
a
nice
blend
of
malts
and
hops
somewhat
complex
and
very
tasty
like
a
hoppy
cup
of
mocha
iced
coffee
taste
is
at
first
roasty
coffee
and
chocolate
with
some
definite
bitterness
from
the
hops
shining
through
finishes
a
curious
blend
of
bitter
citrus
hops
and
roasty
malts
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
mix
of
styles
this
is
a
better
dark
beer
than
sierra
nevadas
porter
or
stout
not
a
hop
bomb
by
any
means
this
black
ipa
is
very
balanced
and
provides
a
near
perfect
integration
of
dark
malt
and
hops
12oz
bottle
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
14
inch
of
head
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
sweet
citrus
and
pine
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
is
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
upfront
followed
by
some
piney
hops
chocolate
and
pine
at
the
end
with
some
more
roasty
notes
medium
bodied
minimal
alcohol
presence
certainly
a
nice
beer
to
find
in
a
mix
12
pack
overall
pretty
good
black
ipa
id
probably
buy
on
its
own
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
black
ipas
is
anybody
a
very
well
done
black
ale
though
nothing
particularly
memorable
overall
poured
into
a
seattle

pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
with
only
slight
light
transmission

that
dissipates
slowly
to
a
thin
film
leaving
lots
of

of

herbs
slightly
vegetal
flavor
follows
with
toasted

piney
and
grassy

mildly
earthy
hints

with
slightly
charred
toastiness
and
grassy

nicely
made

black
ale
with
well
balanced
roast
and
hops
nice
flavor
progression
from
hops
to
coffee
roast
and
malt
in
the
finish
o
just
a
weird
light
beer
with
very
little
hop
flavor
i
wouldnt
call
this
an
ipa
the
roast
and
malts
just
blanket
everything
not
a
fan
all
of
this
is
making
me
less
excited
to
try
torpedo
overall
i
really
hope
they
continue
to
make
this
beer
even
if
i
have
to
buy
the
mixed
12
pack
to
get
it
itd
be
worth
it
i
love
torpedo
snow
wit
is
great
nooner
meh
this
is
a
must
try
get
it
odthis
style
needs
to
be
on
point
for
it
to
be
a
success
in
my
book
this
one
had
no
obvious
flaws
or
putoffs
but
it
failed
to
be
distinctive
in
both
flavor
and
aroma
o
this
is
pretty
good
lots
of
porterstout
character
nice
hop
tones
black
ipa
isnt
my
bag
so
much
but
this
is
really
tasty
o
totally
disappointing
sns
standard
porter
is
far
more
enjoyable
thankfully
i
have
three
more
opportunities
to
give
this
another
chance
this
wasnt
so
horrible
that
i
never
want
to
drink
it
again
im
just
not
that
enthused
by
such
a
prospect
this
is
honestly
my
least
favorite
sn
offering
to
date
o
nice
black
ipa
right
here
not
quite
black
top
but
pretty
darn
good
id
go
for
this
again
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
the
roasted
barley
really
comes
across
as
coffee
along
with
that
huge
chocolate
profile
its
a
nice
counterbalance
for
the
bitter
hops
overall
this
is
a
very
finely
tuned
black
ipa
that
unites
such
a
difference
of
flavors
into
one
delicious
blend
worth
a
try
overall
tastes
like
a
milk
stout
with
a
more
bitter
pinelike
finish
not
really
a
black
ipa
still
good
but
a
little
too
fruity
to
compare
to
better
examples
of
the
style

they
always
seem
to
get

sort
of
boring

bitter
roasted

not
much
citrus
not
much
hop
flavor
outside
the
bitterness
honestly
the
whole
black
ipa
gimmick
is
tiresome
these
are
just
hopped
up
porters
and
black
ales
they
dont
taste
like
ipas
very
dark
brown
color
with
some
deep
crimson
highlights
and
a
glorious
thick
milky

loads
of

of
resinous

merging
with
dark
malt
and
coffee
citrus
rind
and
piney
hop
oils
balance
with
chocolaty
malts
to
form
a
nicely
blended
flavor
well
i
say
balanced
though
the
hop
bitterness
is
clearly
winning
over
any
roasty
qualities
resinous
leafy
spice
with
a
little
char
in
the
aftertaste
feels
solidly
creamy
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
and
bitter
nicely
done
its
not
a
hop
bomb
in
terms
of
aromatics
but
the
end
result
us
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
a
black
ipa
it
was
pretty
true
to
style
but
neither
the
malts
or
the
hops
struck
me
as
being
really
well
done
and
it
just
kind
of
fell
right
in
the
middle
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
a
little
smooth
fairly
clean
a
little
crisp
not
too
filling
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
one
would
be
enough
for
me
since
i
really
dont
have
the
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
i
thought
they
were
both
good
and
true
to
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
it
wasnt
bad
but
but
the
malt
aspect
and
the
hop
aspect
were
just
ok
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
on
its
own
theres
many
black
ipas
that
i
enjoy
much
more
then
this
one
and
i
might
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
just
getting
into
the
style
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
great
example
of
a
black
ipa
all
in
all
i
didnt
think
this
beer
was
that
bad
but
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
great
either
it
kind
of
fell
right
in
the
middle
in
most
aspects
and
i
would
much
rather
have
b
craft
black
ipa
or
shorts
goodnight
bodacious
i
would
say
that
this
one
and
torpedo
were
my
favorite
of
the
mixed
ipa
pack
but
as
for
the
new
ones
this
was
my
favorite
but
as
a
whole
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
new
variety
pack
and
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
nice
work
guys
this
was
a
pretty
solid
black
ipa
dark
nearly
opaque
with
a
nice
large
head
and
plenty
of
sticky
lace
that
clings
all
over
the
glass
aroma
is
caramel
toffee
nutty
cocoa
pine
and
citrus
floral
as
well
taste
is
more
hoppy
than
the
aroma
but
with
a
nice
dark
ale
maltiness
creamy
caramel
milk
chocolate
vanilla
and
some
scattered
hop
flavors
hops
seem
more
heavily
bittering
and
along
with
that
this
beer
has
a
hoppy
resiny
mouthfeel
to
it
very
nice
pretty
good
stuff
maybe
a
little
syrupy
in
texture
around
the
resiny
qualities
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
lattice
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
coffee
bean
and
slight
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
slight
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roast
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
slightly
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
mixture
of
roast
and
hop
qualities
all
around
got
this
as
part
of
sierra
nevadas
new
4
way
ipa
mixer
saved
it
for
last
because
it
was
the
one
that
i
was
the
most
excited
to
try
this
offering
pours
a
deep
mahogany
brown
with
a
generous
and
thick
tan
head
which
dissipates
to
a
half
finger
of
creamy
film
and
a
damn
lot
of
beautiful
lacing
the
aroma
is
complex
with
lots
of
roasty
malts
carrying
notes
of
coffee
and
caramel
as
well
as
a
generous
amount
of
hop
notes
bordering
on
the
piney
side
of
the
spectrum
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
just
as
one
would
hope
for
and
expect
from
this
style
of
ale
the
flavor
is
an
awesome
balance
of
deep
roasted
malts
and
bitter
west
coast
hops
lots
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
followed
by
a
generous
amount
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
this
is
much
more
filling
than
one
would
expect
im
tasting
this
along
side
a
goodnight
bodacious
and
i
honestly
think
that
this
one
wins
out
i
hope
they
release
this
on
its
own
not
just
as
part
of
a
mixer
o
i
dont
even
like
this
style
and
i
enjoyed
this
got
it
in
the
4way
variety
pack
and
im
impressed
but
not
surprised
by
this
sierra
offering
like
all
of
their
beers
it
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
roast
is
a
little
strong
for
my
liking
as
is
the
bitter
finish
wish
the
flavoring
hops
were
more
prevalent
overall
aside
from
the
classic
torpedo
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
4way
ipa
pack
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
black
ipa
that
showcases
roasted
malts
and
a
substantial
hop
presence
without
being
overly
bitter
or
too
much
like
an
ris
poured
from
bottle
part
of
4
way
ipa
pack
deep
brown
nearly
black
and
opaque
pour
with
2
fingers
of
dark
khaki
head
cold
the
aromas
are
muted
piney
hops
with
a
hint
of
coffee
as
it
warms
the
dark
roast
coffee
aromas
take
over
the
hops
medium
bodied
this
is
a
clean
beer
with
nice
roasted
malt
flavors
that
are
quickly
consumed
by
classic
sn
piney
hops
the
hopchocolate
bitterness
on
the
finish
lingers
for
quite
some
time
very
big
coffee
notes
on
the
noseand
very
sweet
ice
coffee
like
taste
this
was
not
a
black
ipa
for
me
i
like
this
beer
it
was
hard
to
taste
any
of
the
hop
characters
in
this
beer
it
was
bitter
but
i
didnt
get
any
grapefruit
pine
notes
slight
grapefruit
as
i
drink
more
o
as
i
said
above
im
just
a
little
dissapointed
with
blindfold
because
it
smells
looks
and
tastes
like
a
porter
this
might
be
the
only
complaint
and
i
do
mean
only
complaint
that
i
have
with
s
n
and
that
is
for
my
money
they
dont
deliver
on
this
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
im
becoming
a
big
fan
of
sierra
nevada
and
this
is
yet
another
beer
i
could
drink
regularly
from
them
matter
of
fact
i
will
drink
it
regularly
since
the
12
packs
are
12
99
everything
sierra
nevada
brews
is
done
well
as
in
this
i
p
a
i
did
not
like
this
beer
it
looks
good
and
smells
alright
but
tasted
mildly
bitter
malty
and
ashy
i
am
a
big
fan
of
sierra
nevada
maybe
black
ales
are
not
for
me
mouth
feel
is
ok
but
its
not
as
bitter
as
i
would
have
thought
for
a
bipa
closer
to
a
porter
in
fell
even
with
the
high
carbonation
looks
like
a
guinness
the
pour
dark
and
foamy
head
ocean
like
lacing
dirt
like
taste
smooth
taste
and
finish
prost
notes
this
is
more
of
a
bad
stout
than
it
is
a
bipa
not
very
good
bitterness
is
flat
mouth
feel
is
thin
and
somewhat
slippery
looks
substantial
but
taste
and
complexity
is
not
satisfying
overall
70
ibus
bottle
was
pkgd
011515
1552
so
its
not
old
this
is
more
like
sort
of
hoppy
porter
very
nice
bipa
would
definitely
recommend
overall
i
like
it
but
will
drink
it
as
a
stout
not
an
ipa
awesome
clean
stout
taste
that
is
known
for
sierra
nevada
beers
hop
taste
is
noticeable
but
not
overbearing
a
perfectly
balanced
combination
o
overall
a
very
nice
beer
although
i
think
the
bitterness
is
a
little
low
for
the
style
still
smooth
and
enjoyable
btw
this
ale
has
two
other
entries
one
discontinued
and
another
from
the
original
beer
camp
this
one
grows
on
me
very
subtle
black
ipa
but
extremely
smooth
certainly
a
good
entry
level
brew
for
the
style
sn
once
again
puts
out
a
winner
not
getting
much
ipa
here
much
more
a
stout
imo
maybe
its
out
of
date
o
this
is
pretty
spot
on
for
a
black
ipa
in
my
books
the
hops
are
good
and
assertive
up
front
but
the
dark
malt
pushes
back
too
i
dig
it
i
welcome
the
others
but
not
back
to
back
nose
roasted

starts
as
a
porter
then
comes
to
bitter
with
too
much
after
taste
good
roasted
malt
flavor
some
black
licorice
and
a
modest
hop
bitterness
to
finish
o
i
was
expecting
more
citrusy
or
piny
hop
aromas
and
flavors
on
this
wasnt
there
more
roasty
than
hoppy
still
a
good
tasting
beer
its
almost
6
weeks
old
so
i
am
not
sure
if
the
hops
have
died
off
but
its
less
than
i
expected
tastes
more
like
a
stout
than
an
ipa
wasnt
bad
just
didnt
rate
too
high
with
me
wookey
jack
is
much
better
by
comparison
i
like
the
blindfold
its
not
as
bold
as
the
stone
ssra
but
its
an
lighter
version
it
pours
a
dark
opaque
with
think
ecru
head
that
is
leaving
a
nice
lacing
the
scent
carries
pine
and
some
citrus
like
hops
the
taste
carries
ipa
flare
with
coffeeroastpeat
base
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
solid
the
only
minor
tweak
i
would
make
would
be
to
turn
down
the
carbonation
a
notch
but
this
is
a
minor
quibble
as
the
beer
is
tasty
and
balanced
o
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
probably
my
2nd
favorite
from
the
4way
ipa
pack
after
snow
white
wit
its
an
ipa
so
its
supposed
to
be
hoppy
but
the
dark
color
makes
you
think
it
would
be
sweet
and
malty
as
well
but
it
isnt
if
you
think
youd
like
a
slightly
coffee
flavored
bitter
hoppy
beer
then
youll
like
this
i
did
o
a
nice
black
ipa
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
a
real
nice
black
ipa
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
in
6
packs
another
solid
beer
from
sierra
nevada
who
it
appears
can
do
near
no
wrong
not
my
absolute
favourite
cda
but
solid
and
drinkable
and
worth
the
4way
ipa
pack
in
which
it
came
even
if
the
other
three
variations
werent
already
enjoyable
themselves
which
for
the
most
part
they
are
though
this
is
probably
my
favourite
of
the
four
yes
that
includes
torpedo
such
heresy
overall
pretty
good
but
it
would
have
been
nice
to
try
this
fresher
to
get
a
better
sense
of
the
hop
presence
intended
considering
that
this
is
solid
and
worth
the
try
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
is
certainly
a
dark
beer
but
it
also
has
a
good
fingers
width
of
offwhite
foam
atop
it
dense
and
lasting
the
nose
features
some
good
darkmalt
aroma
like
a
european
dunkel
toastcrusty
not
caramel
nor
roast
i
cant
find
any
hops
in
the
smell
though
which
is
odd
for
anything
labeled
ipa
the
hops
do
come
through
in
the
flavor
but
its
primarily
bitterness
without
hop
flavor
it
does
have
a
nice
complex
malt
all
bready
but
i
think
the
description
ipa
is
definitely
off
this
is
just
a
bitter
dark
ale
as
far
as
black
ipas
go
this
isnt
a
particularly
interesting
one
of
the
bunch
overall
rarely
do
i
meet
a
sn
beer
that
i
dont
like
and
this
is
no
different
overall
i
think
this
beer
presents
a
very
nice
balance
showcasing
the
two
primary
elements
of
a
black
ale
quite
well
this
is
what
a
black
ale
should
be
i
would
get
this
again
if
it
went
to
six
packs
i
didnt
really
notice
a
overpowering
nose
to
this
beer
the
taste
is
very
satisfying
starts
with
a
good
hop
hit
with
quite
a
bit
of
floral
notes
the
coffee
flavor
as
a
finish
is
a
little
bitter
but
that
is
ok
thin
head
good
cling
to
the
glass
good
overall
everyday
beer
in
my
opinion
pours
dark
black
white
foam
starts
at
14
inch
and
settles
with
lacing
chocolate
malty
nose
some
pine
rich
malt
open
flavor
that
eases
into
a
subtle
pine
mint
taste
notes
of
earthy
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
oily
hoppy
close
real
good
black
ipa
balanced
and
chewy
theres
an
underlying
coffee
roast
aroma
with
a
light
grapefruit
note
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
piney
with
a
big
intense
bitterness
and
a
long
lingering
finish
some
roast
and
dark
chocolate
comes
through
and
round
it
out
oa
well
made
black
ipa
easily
the
best
of
the
new
beers
from
the
pack
o
good
stuff
overall
a
tasty
beer
poured
a
big
foamy
head
on
a
black
body
the
aroma
is
rich
roasted
malt
with
lemon
coming
in
second
the
taste
starts
with
smooth
roasted
malt
with
moderate
lemon
bitterness
nice
balance
the
texture
is
crisp
with
moderate
carbonation
really
good
solid
beer
and
you
could
certainly
drink
a
couple
overall
its
delicious
and
seems
like
a
departure
from
the
more
traditional
offerings
from

o
overall
i
enjoy
this
beer
very
much
i
am
a
big
porter
drinker
but
also
enjoy
the
ipas
this
beer
is
the
perfect
combination
of
both
starts
out
mildly
hoppy
and
then
is
smoothed
out
by
the
malts
ends
dry
like
most
most
good
ipas
very
clean
smelling
and
tasting
overall
seems
to
have
more
hop
character
than
the
original
beer
camp
variant
while
still
maintaining
that
nice
roast
malt
base
and
for
me
thats
a
plus
this
is
a
beer
i
might
consider
buying
a
sixer
of
from
time
to
time
if
that
day
were
to
come
medium
bodied
with
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
small
hop
bite
finishes
clean
overall
this
is
a
good
entry
level
black
ipa
which
is
as
accessible
as
it
is
hop
forward
d
this
one
drinks
more
like
an
american
porter
thats
not
a
bad
thing
just
an
observation
its
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
most
sierra
nevada
offerings
solidly
above
average
and
not
much
more
a
decent
beer
worth
exploring
but
not
something
i
would
revisit
with
regularity
given
the
increasing
number
of
quality
american
black
ales
readily
available
in
the
market
place
overall
a
good
black
ipa
and
even
above
average
compared
to
what
ive
had
but
not
outstanding
easy
to
drink
and
hoppy
enough
to
fit
in
with
the
sierra
nevada
profile
it
was
a
good
new
beer
from
sierra
nevada
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
recommend
and
have
again
overall
this
ones
a
bit
reminiscent
of
averys
new
world
porter
like
a
porter
meets
a
piney
cascadian
ipa
the
odd
combo
of
roastiness
and
hop
bitterness
can
be
jarring
at
first
but
this
one
evens
out
just
fine
a
good
beer
with
an
impressively
long
finish
aftertaste
o
a
nice
black
ipa
definetly
worth
trying
a
really
good
black
ipa
the
best
one
the
variety
4way
pack
my
favorite
of
the
4
in
this
twelve
pack
great
example
the
style
done
right
o
this
is
another
strong
entry
from
sn
but
falls
slightly
short
of
outstanding
easy
going
for
6
8
abv
certainly
worth
a
try
or
two
overall
not
bad
nice
dark
malt
profile
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
even
slight
dark
chocolate
but
the
hops
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
earthy
pine
and
forest
floor
arent
too
bad
except
they
start
to
clash
with
the
dark
malts
imo
and
the
mild
orange
is
also
meh
i
do
like
that
little
minty
herbal
tea
note
late
on
the
finish
and
the
grassy
and
spicy
hop
notes
would
have
been
a
nice
touch
if
they
earthy
piney
citrus
rind
hops
didnt
overpower
it
again
just
continues
that
this
is
one
of
my
least
fav
styles
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
right
in
line
with
sn
standards
probably
my
favorite
from
the
variety
pack
a
big
flavor
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
not
for
amateurs
its
nothing
earth
shattering
but
a
great
change
of
pace
from
normal
ipas
id
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
and
would
buy
a
six
pack
in
the
future
but
i
wouldnt
kill
a
man
for
it
more
black
than
ipa
more
hops
please
drinkability
very
good
they
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
very
smooth
i
would
love
to
and
will
have
this
one
again
o
a
tasty
and
wellbalanced
black
ipa
wanting
to
do
a
sidebyside
with
shipyards
new
black
ipa
also
left
wondering
if
this
is
a
second
production
run
of
beer
camp
73
black
ale
which
was
also
called
blindfold
perhaps
not
though
that
one
had
a
significantly
higher
7
4
abv
does
not
have
the
dark
malt
flavor
that
i
look
for
in
these
beers
still
some
really
nice
hop
flavors
and
excellent
mouthfeel
o
a
solid
beer
overall
though
quite
bitter
id
like
a
bit
more
depth
and
less
bitterness
pours
almost
black
can
see
through
and
see
ruby
tints
nice
tan
long
lasting
head
smells
of
chocolate
malts
with
some
roast
in
the
background
some
spicy
hops
and
some
fruitiness
no
off
flavors
but
i
expected
a
stronger
hop
aroma
upfront
roast
chocolate
with
a
nice
firm
bitterness
that
follows
some
coffee
flavors
and
spicy
hops
maybe
a
little
pine
mouthfeel
seems
about
medium
with
nice
crisp
bitterness
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
nice
attempt
at
a
black
ipa
would
like
the
hops
to
pop
out
some
more
as
i
feel
the
dark
malts
are
a
little
too
much
in
the
forefront
even
still
not
a
bad
beer
whatsoever
very
drinkable
and
solid
from
sn
the
taste
is
malty
up
front
with
a
woody
and
toasted
taste
with
some
peppery
hops
entering
mid
palate
with
a
more
bitter
flavor
increasing
toward
the
end
the
malt
is
bitter
with
deep
roast
in
the
taste
almost
charcoal
like
burnt
with
some
interesting
caramel
accents
but
hops
linger
in
the
flavor
after
the
swallow
with
some
pine
and
herbal
accents
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
but
well
brewed
and
worth
trying
overall
its
a
wellmade
delicious
brew
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
an
excellent
example
of
a
hopforward
black
ale
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
but
it
leans
more
towards
the
malty
side
and
the
hops
are
more
complementary
in
general
i
like
this
beer
it
looked
fantastic
and
smelled
great
now
all
they
need
to
do
is
work
on
the
taste
overall
a
good
black
ipa
i
hope
to
try
more
soon
to
get
a
better
gauge
on
the
style
this
is
a
good
brew
ill
certainly
enjoy
the
other
2
bottles
in
the
box
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
love
to
have
again
its
a
solid
brew
and
one
that
demonstrates
what
makes
black
ipas
so
awesome
im
a
sucker
for
black
ipas
as
its
honestly
the
closest
that
you
can
get
to
the
best
of
both
worlds
blindfold
is
not
a
big
in
your
face
black
ipa
it
does
not
contain
a
huge
abv
no
long
alcohol
finish
no
acute
hop
twinge
what
blindfold
is
a
well
crafted
well
balanced
ale
plenty
of
roasted
malt
flavor
but
the
blend
of
summit
and
cascade
hops
really
brings
it
all
together
really
well
done
nice
color
nothing
special
in
this
beer
ive
had
some
great
black
ipas
this
however
was
not
one
of
them
drinks
ok
but
one
and
done
for
me
dark
brown
pour
edged
with
a
little
tannish
foam
not
a
heavy
head
nor
super
hoppy
smell
as
youd
expect
with
a
double
so
i
think
that
brings
down
its
score
a
bit
the
smell
is
a
bit
loamy
and
damp
with
some
spicy
grapefruit
on
top
and
what
a
fantastic
flavor
which
is
what
matters
right
very
different
profile
than
others
on
the
head
the
smell
and
look
which
may
be
chalked
up
to
the
hemp
seeds
but
i
dont
care
fun
beer
will
drink
again
and
again
then
sleep
and
drink
some
more
pours
a
dark
brown
color
one

with

notes
like
a
thin

big
beer
but
if
there
was
any
drawbacks
i
got
a
slight
tinny
flavor
initially
bottle
best
by
early
august
poured
into
snifter
dark
dark
color
one
finger
head
some
lacing
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
black

style
and
this
is
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
more
on
the
roasty
side
than
hoppy
very
solid
brew
would
have
again
outstanding
appearance
is
a
huge
foamy
thick
light
tan
long
lasting
head
with
plenty
of
lace
and
an
opaque

aroma
is
fresh

with
a
bit
of
a
doobie
character
roast
malt
flavors
somewhat
similar
to
nose
plus
quite
dry
except
in
finish
then
a
hint
of
sweet
comes
out
very
bitter
some
tang
body
is
good
though
the
extreme
bitter
coupled
with
alcohol
warmth
yields
a
strange
tingle
while
still
being
oddly
smooth
big
beer
o
really
nice
black
ipa
top
of
the
line
black
imperial
ipa
hoppy
as
hell
with
notes
of
coffee
i
will
make
this
a
regular
only
thing
i
have
to
note
is
that
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
black
ipa
but
you
see
a
new
beer
in
your
liquor
store
one
made
with
hemp
seed
at
that
you
give
it
a
whirl
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
this
a
rather
approachable
black
ipa
for
all
that
is
in
it
it
is
well
rounded
not
a
beer
for
everyday
however
one
i
will
take
a
second
gander
at
great
beer
from
my
home
town
a
great
company
and
nailed
it
with
this
beer
pours
a
dark
almost
black
deep
brown
producing
a
huge
2
finger
mocha
somewhat
lasting
head
that
leaves
webby
sheets
of
lace
aroma
dark
malt
hersheys
semisweet
chocolate
toffee
faint
smoke
forward
backed
by
citrus
pine
hops
taste
dry
astringent
bitter
chocolate
burnt
bitter
coffee
phenolic
resinous
hops
finish
is
a
continuation
of
the
drying
astringent
bitterness
that
intensifies
lingers
long
into
the
aftertaste
bottom
line
this
is
super
hoppy
and
super
tasty
the
abv
is
hidden
well
too
worthy
of
repurchases
the
beer
smells
like
metal
black
ipa
not
really
my
thing
and
this
was
bottled
june
2014
that
said
not
bad
i
kinda
like
the
malty
undertone
in
my
experience
its
much
better
on
tap
than
bottled
the
tap
version
would
be
a
solid
5
higher
but
the
bottled
version
needs
to
be
accounted
for
too
even
when
bottled
its
not
bad
at
all
but
rather
just
unremarkable
to
me
in
both
versions
the
9
2
abv
is
definitely
something
you
can
taste
though
thats
not
necessarily
good
or
bad
pours
a
dark
brownred
smells
of
pine
spice
roast
malts
and
coffee
taste
is
dominated
by
pine
resin
and
roasted
malts
pine
resin
and
roast
malt
aftertaste
with
a
little
chocolate
very
tasty
but
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
flavor
diversity
especially
considering
it
is
a
black
ipa
ive
got
to
find
this
more
regularly
sos
i
remember
its
a
doobie
beautiful
tan
head
over
the
clear
black
liquid
looks
so
wonderful
great
lacing
on
the
glass
too
the
smell
has
a
clean
roasted
barley
character
with
a
massive
floral
piney
hop
bouquet
taste
is
superior
to
most
black
ales
with
a
chocolatey
and
porter
like
roastedness
coming
through
the
many
layers
of
fresh
hops
this
beer
was
pleasing
sip
after
sip
great
clean
fresh
taste
must
have
again
purchased
one
bottle
from
total
wine
and
more
i
typically
like
black
ipas
and
brew
my
one
once
in
a
while
as
a
nice
change
in
pace
to
traditional
although
this
delivered
nice
malty
back
bone
good
hoppiness
nice
feel
i
found
a
weird
presence
of
a
metallic
like
taste
made
the
spot
between
my
cheek
and
ear
twinge
i
want
to
like
this
beer
but
its
just
ok
for
me
then
i
realized
im
drinking
20
days
past
best
buy
date
ill
blame
the
wife
for
rushing
me
through
the
bottle
shop
and
force
her
to
drink
it
and
crack
open
a
fresher
beer
for
now
but
i
will
definitely
wish
to
try
this
one
again
only
fresher
will
update
then
if
you
have
a
clean
pallet
you
can
taste
the
slightest
hint
of
hemp
by
56
way
through
the
beer
beat
nose
of
any
dark
ipa
ive
had
probably
best
dark
ipa
ive
had
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
tried
hoppier
than
most
and
the
hop
flavor
holds
out
longer
in
this
beer
than
it
does
in
many
of
its
peers
midway
through
however
i
feel
like
im
having
a
porter
not
an
ipa

a
new
favorite
beer
brilliantly
blends
malty
sweetness
with
hop
bitterness
initial
tastes
are
of
chocolate
and
caramel
but
finished
strong
with
a
large
dose
of
traditional
ipa
hops
but
enough
of
the
malts
remain
to
keep
it
balanced
its
an
alright
black
ipa
i
can
really
taste
the
alcohol
also
i
can
barely
taste
the
coffee
but
i
can
smell
it
black
ipas
are
not
my
thing
i
qualify
the
above
with
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
brewed
with
hemp
seed
so
the
entire
experience
may
have
been
a
hallucination
on
my
part
this
beer
has
a
dark
amber
color
initially
chocolate
hemp
and
roasted
malts
smell
tastes
much
like
it
smells
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
flavors
does
a
great
job
masking
the
the
eventual
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
the
flavors
mask
the
abv
quite
well
an
almost
chocolatey
yet
light
delicious
black
ipa
it
probably
helps
that
its
only
three
weeks
old
but
nonetheless
i
am
so
impressed

while

enjoyed
this

it
is
definitely
a
one
a
night
beer
and
while
i
could
drink
more
of
them
in
the
future
im
increasingly
finding
that
my
tastes
are
shifting
from
high
abv
intensely
flavored
beers
towards
more
subtle
beers
where
the
hops
and
malt
play
together
nicely
with
some
sweetness
some
earthy
bitterness
and
a
nice
dryness
at
the
end
that
invites
another
sip
o

i
really
like
this
beer
the
appearance
smell
and
tastes
are
all
hitting
there
is
a
slight
sense
of
alcohol
but
not
bad
for
a
9
2
abv
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
that
i
would
drink
more
than
12
of
in
a
sitting
also
i
liked
the
flavors
a
bit
more
when
it
was
colder
the
warmth
brought
out
a
bit
more
of
the
earthy
and
bitter
tones
and
subdued
the
chocolate
picked
up
this
little
12
oz
bottle
at
total
wine
last
night
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
from
this
brewery
in
salt
lake
city
utah
but
i
like
imperial
ipas
a
lot
and
always
willing
to
take
the
gamble
jackpot
pours
rich
and
creamy
into
a
tulip
glass
a
nice
slim
head
and
very
rich
lacing
stays
until
the
the
last
drop
this
is
a
somewhat
boozy
total
black
beer
it
starts
out
malty
sweet
with
chocolate
and
coffee
overtones
but
quickly
surrenders
to
the
hops
and
109
ibus
at
the
finish
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
not
the
best
black
ipa
that
i
have
ever
had
but
definitely
in
my
top
5
i
am
now
going
to
include
uinta
brewing
company
on
my
search
list
when
looking
for
something
unique
to
share
with
my
friends
this
beer
reminds
me
of
myrcenary
double
ipa
by
odell
brewing
co
these
two
are
tied
for
first
place
they
both
have
an
awesome
robust
flavor
and
a
wonderful
aftertaste
great
sipping
beers
unitas

is

this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
on
the
market
and
the
best
one
that
i
have
had
beating
the
exceptional
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
out
with
the
extraordinary
mouthfeel
way
to
go
uinta
you
have
my
attention
wifes
review
interesting
its
not
bad
she
took
more
than
one
sip
nice
its
dark
and
has
a
really
high
ibu
makes
a
good
combination
for
me
higher
alcohol
but
does
not
taste
it
quite
smooth
bought
this
in
cleveland
somehow
kind
of
reminds
me
of
some
stone
ipa
product
very
good
overall
would
buy
it
again
if
i
see
it
ever
a
good
black
ipa
peaks
early
with
the
aroma
but
cant
quite
follow
up
with
such
promise
balanced
malt
and
hops
it
just
need
more
carbonation
and
a
brighter
hops
to
pop
the
way
some
others
are
able
to
do
pours
a
dark
oily
brown
with
a
tan
head
and
plenty
of
lace
aroma
has
herbal
hops
citrus
and
some
roasted
malt
in
the
taste
more
unsweetened
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
like
malt
flavor
that
has
good
hop
balance
some
earthy
bitters
and
dirty
citrus
round
out
the
flavor
full
bodied
and
relatively
smooth
overall
you
cant
complain
about
a
big
balanced
hoppy
black
ale
it
does
not
suck
at
all
the
common
flaw
in
black
ipa
is
that
they
usually
result
in
a
hoppy
porter
and
resemble
american
ipa
in
no
way
however
the
imperialized
porter
supports
in
dubhe
gives
this
dark
beer
a
roundness
thats
even
still
commanded
by
hops
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
a
fine
beer
experience
and
probably
the
best
black
lager
ive
tried
so
far
o
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
this
beer
tasted
almost
identical
to
wookey
jack
the
aromas
were
heavenly
but
the
taste
ended
far
too
burned
and
bitter
for
my
palate
huge
flavors
nice
complexity
just
not
my
style
o
very
interesting
black
ipa
the
aroma
was
pretty
standard
but
the
flavor
is
full
of
hop
character
this
would
be
almost
unbearably
bitter
and
hoppy
if
not
for
the
strong
roasted
malt
asis
it
is
extremely
strong
and
bitter
and
i
love
big
bigger
ipas
it
would
just
be
over
the
top
instead
it
is
just
extremely
strong
overall
a
big
bitter
imperial
black
ale
lingering
bitterness
the
hemp
seeds
set
this
black
ipa
apart
from
the
rest
well
done
uinta
o
a
good
imperial
black
ipa
id
have
another
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
with
garnet
highlights
at
the
edges
and
a
huge
bubbly
tan
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
earthy
pine
dominate
with
bits
of
caramel
and
chocolate
in
supporting
roles
the
flavor
is
rich
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
with
lots
of
earthy
pine
and
citrus
hop
flavor
moderate
to
high
level
of
hop
bitterness
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
slick
resinous
mouthfeel
i
enjoyed
this
brew
its
just
at
is
expiration
date
which
i
didnt
notice
at
the
store
but
its
still
drinking
really
well
id
like
to
revisit
this
with
a
fresher
bottle
as
this
one
has
lots
of
porter
like
qualities
to
it
at
this
time
o
definitely
a
hoppedout
stout
how
could
you
argue
love
the
mint
chocolate
element
not
too
much
different
than
the
lions
share
of
black
ales
but
all
the
flavors
are
potent
and
matched
easy
sell
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
the
style
overall
this
is
such
a
great
cda
sorry
but
i
call
em
cdas
its
very
dark
yet
aromatic
as
can
be
with
that
enormous
amount
of
hops
its
sweet
yet
balanced
maybe
not
as
dry
as
some
others
but
it
is
still
my
favorite
black
ipacda
by
far
it
really
cant
get
better
and
this
beer
has
a
serious
punch
for
me
on
this
review
i
was
one
and
done
o
overall
what
a
black
ipa
or
in
this
case
dipa

and
completely
different
from
other
black
ipas
ive
tried
soft
aromas
of
herbs
grains
cocoa
and
barley
black
appearance
with
a
tan
foam
line
smooth
flavors
of
herbs
roasted
caramel
juicy
grapefruit
and
citrus
overtones
other
subtle
notes
of
coffee
beans
molasses
chocolate
and
hop
resin
overall
a
very
nice
black
ipa
smooth
and
flavorful
very
noticeable
alcohol
finish
very
tasty
consistently
good
all
the
way
through
a
highlight
from
this
brewery
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
i
especially
like
the
9
2
abv
o
overall
this
was
a
good
dipa
it
was
interesting
with
the
earthy
aroma
and
flavor
it
was
a
little
bitter
for
my
preference
i
wouldnt
buy
again
but
i
would
drink
it
again
o
this
is
great
black
ipa
it
has
a
solid
bite
of
hops
not
overly
sweet
malt
base
and
best
of
all
a
huge
abv
definitely
a
great
beer
for
the
fall
season
overall
pretty
awesome
black
ale
and
the
alcohol
is
merely
noticeable
porter
stout
nope
its
a
delicious
black
ale
o
nicely
done
black
ipa
very
similar
to
others
i
have
had
21st
amendment
total
4050
the
beer
is
a
black
imperial
ipa
brewed
with
hemp
seed
so
the
interest
factor
goes
up
by
a
whole
lot
the
beer
is
dark
with
a
strong
hop
taste
this
beer
would
rate
up
there
with
the
best
of
any
black
ipa
i
have
ever
tried
i
also
thought
that
the
name
was
creative
the
abv
on
this
beer
is
9
20
which
is
up
there
but
it
does
not
deter
from
the
taste
of
this
beer
at
all
bottle
in
a
tumbler
pours
a
dark
coffee
black
with
a
good
amount
of
foam
not
much
aroma
taste
is
dark
roasty
and
bitter
it
is
described
as
being
brewed
with
hemp
seed
but
im
not
sure
what
that
contributes
as
i
dont
know
what
hemp
seed
tastes
like
overall
it
is
quite
complex
but
still
drinkable
even
with
the
high
abv
this
is
the
best
uinta
ive
had
it
also
fares
very
well
as
a
black
ipa
cheers
outstanding
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
a
number
of
times
and
i
struggle
with
it
each
time
while
it
has
its
merits
the
flavors
just
dont
blend
together
very
well
so
i
find
the
beer
quite
unbalanced
its
pronounced
doobee
dont
ask
me
how
to
pronounce
uinta
love
this
beer
though
bought
it
in
a
4
pack
for
10
perfect
this
is
a
fantastic
boozy
black
ipa
the
hop
aroma
is
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
fumes
but
you
wont
mind
once
it
starts
to
warm
your
belly
the
bitter
chocolate
of
the
malt
and
grapefruit
of
the
hops
are
the
most
prominent
flavors
o
this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic
example
of
a
cascadian
dark
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
phenomenal
and
each
sip
is
an
absolute
pleasure
i
personally
cant
tell
if
the
hemp
seeds
are
adding
to
the
earthiness
of
the
flavor
but
regardless
its
nice
to
see
some
experimenting
with
hemp
seeds
highly
recommended
for
those
who
are
fans
of
dark
and
hoppy
ales
overall
very
good
high
abv
black
ipa
a
bit
heavy
somewhat
syrupy
but
well
done
ill
come
back
to
this
on
a
cold
day
o
wow
this
beer
means
business
makes
a
great
nightcap
hops
tend
to
dominate
but
not
to
the
detriment
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
poured
this
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
was
black
with
a
tan
head
and
tons
of
lacing
the
nose
was
awesome
lots
of
hops
and
very
malty
i
loved
the
taste
very
nice
imperial
ipa
with
loads
of
hops
and
a
malty
backbone
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
a
rauch
taste
didnt
present
itself
the
mouthfeel
was
great
nice
n
thick
with
good
carbonation
not
sure
how
a
an
imperial
black
ipa
should
be
scored
in
terms
of
overall
score
since
it
was
my
first
so
i
gave
it
a
4
5
would
i
have
it
again
hell
yes
if
youre
meandering
through
the
great
state
of
utah
order
a
round
of
this
fine
ale
grab
a
few
bottles
to
take
home
bring
a
couple
for
me
a
huge
beer
says
it
is
brewed
with
hemp
seed
not
sure
why
or
what
that
is
adding
but
ok
poured
into
a
large
goblet
from
a
12oz
bottle
not
quite
black
more
mahogany
with
a
very
thin
head
that
i
didnt
think
would
ever
show
up
despite
my
increasingly
aggressive
pour
smells
like
fig
raisin
soy
sauce
and
pine
taste
is
dark
fruit
smoke
and
hop
bitters
no
detectable
alcohol
to
me
but
there
are
some
really
strong
elements
contending
here
overall
a
nice
stoutishipa
with
huge
abv
couldnt
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
but
id
probably
get
another
single
again
overall
impression
a
big
enjoyable
black
ipa
seemed
a
little
disjointed
but
hits
all
the
characteristics
you
would
expect
given
the
brewers
label
of
this
one
for
the
price
its
tough
to
beat
well
done
overall
a
well
balanced
beer
that
exhibits
both
strong
maltiness
and
strong
bitterness
but
at
different
times
during
the
drink
the
mouth
is
coating
and
a
touch
oily
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
black
ipa
lots
of
dank
hop
flavor
in
here
beautiful
black
imperial
ipa
full
of
flavors
with
strong
character
in
all
three
key
ingredients
i
loved
the
constant
interchanging
taste
feature
a
must
try
beer
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beer
was
its
inclusive
aroma
here
we
met
nice
fruitiness
solid
hoppiness
creaminess
and
hearty
grainy
grit
these
notes
all
made
their
way
to
the
flavoring
but
were
pushed
a
bit
too
far
to
the
side
by
the
boisterous
booze
that
seemed
to
invade
each
aspect
of
the
sip
thus
at
times
it
was
rather
harsh
but
enough
room
was
left
for
the
nicer
thicker
qualities
of
the
hops
and
grain
to
poke
through
on
another
positive
note
the
label
is
one
of
the
simplest
most
elegant
weve
seen
in
recent
memory
which
is
partly
why
we
were
so
excited
for
this
one
expect
a
strong
beer
from
the
get
go
but
dont
be
surprised
if
it
isnt
as
balanced
as
you
would
have
liked
heavier
bodied
and
a
piney
finish
long
after
taste
leaves
the
mouth
feel
a
big
slick
run
of
the
mill
black
ipa
the
imperial
might
hurt
it
a
bit
o
the
taste
is
good
not
great
the
aroma
is
not
very
good
at
all
this
is
an
okay
beer
it
has
some
complexity
is
not
terribly
drinkable
which
is
okay
worth
trying
one
not
something
youd
necessarily
actively
seek
out
o
this
is
an
extremely
enjoyable
imperial
black
ipa
in
all
aspects
this
beer
is
pleasing
balanced
simple
and
still
interesting
i
really
have
zero
complaints
must
try
the
complete
experience
of
this
brew
is
very
positive
i
must
say
that
the
only
part
i
dont
truly
love
is
the
scent
right
at
the
point
of
each
sip
but
the
changing
nature
of
each
taste
and
balance
of
different
stylistic
elements
make
this
a
great
craft
id
say
this
is
a
musthave
in
the
class
of
black
ipas
o
the
good
blend
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
make
this
a
pleasure
to
drink
its
even
balance
makes
this
not
quite
a
stout
and
note
quite
an
ipa
but
it
has
a
perfect
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
has
great
flavor
but
goes
down
rather
smooth
for
an
imperial
black
ipa
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
and
its
really
a
style
im
not
super
fond
of
but
id
buy
this
again
o
this
style
is
working
its
way
up
my
ladder
this
i
believe
is
a
great
example
of
a
cascadian
dark
o
a
mix
of
a
porter
and
an
ipa
its
a
very
deep
brew
lots
going
on
here
but
it
is
a
very
enjoyable
drink
90
tasty
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
45
wonderful
beer
so
much
character
and
depth
this
would
appeal
to
anyone
into
big
stouts
and
porters
but
with
an
equal
affinity
for
hops
just
hits
the
hops
and
malt
flavors
in
a
big
way
so
happy
to
have
tried
this
this
was
probably
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
to
date
very
complex
and
interesting
not
just
a
porter
with
some
extra
hops
as
best
i
can
tell
this
is
a
first
release
probably
not
a
first
effort
obviously
but
a
damn
good
one
none
the
less
poured
into
becker
pint
glass
pours
jet
black
with
a
huge
fluffy
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
tons
of
rocky
lacing
smell
is
huge
citrusey
and
piney
hops
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
some
alcohol
present
in
the
nose
too
taste
is
a
perfect
blend
of
huge
bitter
piney
hops
and
bittersweet
chocolate
malts
with
a
full
body
a
delicious
black
ale
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
love
it
in
an
imperial
version
pours
black
with
red
highlights
around
the
edges
mocha
colored
head
of
creamy
foam
that
fell
off
to
a
rocky
cap
and
clinging
lace
nose
is
understated
and
a
graceful
blending
of
chocolate
and
piney
hops
the
fruit
was
there
but
not
as
prominent
as
it
could
have
been
chocolate
was
strong
but
not
bitter
on
the
nose
looks
and
smells
like
candy
spice
character
is
very
faint
and
the
malt
opens
up
with
the
chocolate
as
it
warms
and
some
caramel
and
sugar
taste
is
round
and
roasted
hops
are
bitter
but
not
aggressive
drinks
dry
and
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
aftertaste
pine
needles
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
on
the
back
palate
finishes
with
a
bitterness
that
stops
just
short
of
harsh
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
but
a
little
unbalanced
as
the
roasted
malt
left
a
little
sour
like
coffee
that
had
sat
in
the
pot
too
long
the
alcohol
really
came
through
as
this
warmed
and
left
a
little
burn
going
down
it
was
more
carbonated
than
it
looked
this
was
a
vigorous
imperial
black
ipa
that
really
gets
your
attention
o
maybe
i
just
dont
get
the
style
i
dont
know
i
figure
it
should
have
much
more
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
if
it
has
the
ipa
badge
on
it
and
not
just
flavorless
bitterness
way
too
roasty
little
hop
character
other
than
bitterness
even
if
the
hops
were
more
present
the
flavor
combination
of
roasted
malt
and
pinecitrus
hops
just
isnt
going
to
work
for
me
not
gettin
this
one
again
oi
have
been
looking
for
a
great
black
ipa
and
this
one
is
it
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
what
you
are
looking
for
with
this
style
the
hop
and
malt
bill
balance
each
other
out
very
well
and
works
perfectly
in
the
smelltaste
of
the
beer
o
probably
the
best
thing
uinta
brews
for
sure
great
black
ipa
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
example
of
a
black
imperial
ipa
the
hops
and
malts
are
balanced
well
and
complement
one
another
no
sign
of
the
high
alcohol
content
so
beware
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
o
always
thought
the
uinta
stuff
was
solid
but
this
was
big
surprise
a
powerful
pine
bomb
with
a
complex
roasted
malt
structure
balancing
things
out
nicely
delicious
taste
starts
with
citrusy
and
floral
hops
along
with
roasty
malts
the
roasty
malts
quickly
overpower
the
hops
then
comes
a
strong
chocolate
taste
more
than
smell
along
with
a
bit
of
hemp
seed
in
the
finish
has
a
crisp
but
very
roasted
finished
has
a
medium
body
with
a
bit
of
a
butterycreamy
feel
low
carbonation
black
ipas
arent
my
favorite
but
this
one
has
a
good
name
and
is
a
very
good
beer
had
on
tap
at
the
sierra
grille
drink
was
poured
in
a
tulip
glassware
drink
looked
beautiful
jet
black
with
a
brown
frothy
head
the
aromas
were
rich
and
malty
with
a
burnt
cocoa
mixed
with
citrus
hints
just
loved
smelling
the
drink
from
the
glassware
delicious
drink
with
alcohol
hints
with
creamy
toffee
and
hops
mouthfeel
was
great
helped
the
drink
have
a
frappey
creamy
texture
with
little
carbonation
overall
this
was
fantastic

overall
this
beer
was
bought
on
me
being
random
on
my
last
trip
to
pennsylvania
stayed
in
my
fridge
for
about
a
week
and
absolutely
awesome
i
honestly
think
i
found
my
favorite
black
ipa
thank
you
uinta
for
making
a
classic
salud
not
as
thick
or
heavy
as
a
stout
but
with
a
bit
more
body
than
a
typical
ipa
though
it
falls
within
the
mediumbodied
range
this
beer
drinks
more
to
that
end
it
has
a
solid
cripness
and
flows
smoothly
beer
brewed
with
hemp
seed
from
utah
just
that
is
worth
a
point
or
two
or
a
pint
or
two
or
a
pour
or
two
makes
me
wonder
if
the
brewers
are
just
saying
eff
you
to
the
stereotypical
utahian
yeah
i
pretty
sure
thats
what
you
call
someone
from
utah
this
beer
was
so
tempting
sitting
on
the
shelf
i
had
to
give
it
try
very
cool
labeling
imperial
black
from
the
bottle
earth
wind
and
beer
ignited
by
uinta
brewing

for
best
flavor
enjoy
in
a
glass
brewed
with
renewable
power
wind
solar
imperial
black
ipa
ale
brewed
with
hemp
seed
my
pour
was
a
little
heavyhanded
at
first
and
i
got
some
overflow
as
a
result
once
things
settled
i
had
two
rocky
fingers
of
dense
lightbrown
head
with
good
retention
it
looked
like
meringue
sitting
there
defying
me
to
mess
with
it
color
was
actually
garnetred
believe
it
or
dont
nice
clarity
allowing
for
light
penetration
when
held
up
to
strong
light
nose
was
when
thinngs
began
to
head
south
for
me
it
was
minty
but
with
an
odd
smokiness
overpowering
the
mintiness
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
while
i
have
had
some
instances
where
this
style
put
me
in
mind
of
girl
scout
thin
mints
this
was
not
one
of
them
instead
the
malt
lent
it
a
burnt
bitterness
rather
than
a
chocolatiness
the
hops
were
definitely
minty
but
they
were
losing
the
battle
finish
was
smoky
burnt
and
simply
not
to
my
liking
i
have
a
dream
where
some
day
before
i
am
dead
pot
will
be
legal
as
it
is
now
in
colorado
and
washington
and
brewers
will
have
cool
pot
infused
brews
that
have
a
nice
extra
kick
colorado
seems
especially
ripe
since
it
has
so
many
great
breweries
we
can
dream
o
if
the
abv
wasnt
so
noticeable
this
beer
would
imo
be
better
but
as
it
sits
i
cant
even
finish
this
whole
snifter
decent
if
you
can
get
past
the
abv
o
fun
beer
to
try
especially
if
youve
never
had
an
ale
using
hemp
amongst
its
ingredients
the
beer
didnt
lack
anything
for
me
and
i
felt
like
the
thought
put
into
the
beer
came
through
in
the
pour

done

average
imperial

that
is
surprisingly
easy

and
finishes
clean
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
a
black
ipa
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
but
nothing
earthshattering
i
would
love
to
try
it
again
on
tap
to
see
if
it
adds
anything
to
it
im
a
sucker
for
beer
on
tap
overall
this
is
pretty
good
the
bitterness
subsides
a
bit
after
several
minutes
im
not
blown
away
but
i
like
having
uinta
in
ohio
this
has
a
very
pleasant
pine
flavor
right
off
from
the
hops
which
cooperates
well
with
the
mild
roastiness
and
subtle
cocoa
like
element
with
a
mild
caramel
body
and
light
citrus
element
in
the
hop
flavor
with
subtle
coffee
nuttiness
and
semi
sweet
finish
with
the
hops
pretty
constant
throughout
overall
a
very
quality
imperial
ipa
with
a
little
black
malt
flavor
a
great
beer
for
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
lots
of
hops
with
a
nice
mild
sweetness
to
balance
and
relatively
low
alcohol
on
the
palate
for
the
strength
i
really
love
this
icecold
and
it
is
super
easy
to
put
away
love
and
appreciate
the
fact
i
can
get
this
in
12
oz
bottle
vs
the
22
oz
bombersthanks
uinta
looking
forward
to
pursuing
the
uinta
lineup
this
is
very
impressionable
in
the
same
way
when
i
had
zombie
dust
for
the
first
time
this
brew
is
ridiculous
two
thumbs
up
overall
the
aroma
of
the
beer
and
the
flavors
up
to
the
very
end
of
the
taste
were
fantastic
the
weaker
mouthfeel
and
somewhat
unbalanced
endaftertaste
of
the
brew
hinder
it
from
being
a
truly
great
brew
though
regardless
of
this
it
is
a
tasty
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
overall
drinkability
i
will
not
only
be
having
this
again
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
so
glad
its
now
on
tap
in
the
chicago
area
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
laces
very
nicely
smell
of
hops
smoke
earthy
taste
starts
with
a
fresh
hop
bite
that
opens
to
some
chocolate
smoke
dark
chocolate
but
finishes
again
with
a
bitter
hop
aftertaste
this
is
extremely
balanced
and
very
enjoyable
o
this
is
one
style
that
is
really
starting
to
grow
on
me
i
used
to
absolutely
hate
it
but
in
this
instance
uinta
really
nailed
it
kudos
overall
this
beer
reminds
me
why
black
ipas
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
only
thing
i
dont
think
would
improve
with
more
freshness
with
this
beer
is
the
color
which
is
close
to
being
a
solid
black
but
might
clear
up
my
other
problems
which
were
visible
yeast
and
a
weak
smell
were
this
available
to
me
regularly
id
get
it
frequently
overall
i
really
like
hoppy
beers
but
this
seems
to
be
lacking
something
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
generally
i
prefer
hoppy
beers
with
a
smooth
clean
finish
but
this
is
definitely
not
the
case
here
i
could
live
without
this
beer
love
this
beer
love
the
politics
behind
this
beer
and
its
company
poured
into
a
tumbler
good
color
dark
with
a
light
coffee
head
and
lacing
this
is
a
great
one
and
done
beer
at
9
2
abv
one
beer
and
im
usually
feeling
like
it
is
much
higher
than
9
2
the
taste
is
distinct
from
other
black
ipas
has
to
be
the
hemp
this
is
my
second
growler
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
good
winter
time
brew
and
i
appreciate
the
name
if
this
is
true
about
being
brewed
with
a
bit
of
the
doobie
o
age
hasnt
hurt
this
puppy
one
bit
ive
enjoyed
my
first
uinta
beer
aroma
is
richly
hoppy
and
grassy
with
a
smoky
undertone
and
a
hint
of
molasses
hard
to
beat
that
at
least
in
my
mind
that
loves
black
ipas
um
if
you
think
about
it
thats
an
oxymoron
because
i
love
dark
beers
and
hoppy
beers
it
pours
a
luscious
darkchocolate
brown
that
lets
light
in
only
at
the
edges
and
has
a
thick
fluffy
light
tan
head
that
likes
to
hang
around
flavor
has
a
roast
malt
overtone
with
nutty
molasses
earthy
and
caramel
notes
plus
hints
of
hops
and
licorice
absolutely
lipsmacking
smooth
firm
texture
has
plenty
of
fizz
and
life
i
love
black
pale
ales
personally
i
prefer
the
term
cba
or
cascadian
black
ale
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
a
nice
example
of
the
style
that
hides
its
abv
very
well
another
winner
from
uinita
nice
double
black
ipa
the
hops
do
their
thing
and
youre
always
reminded
that
youre
drinking
an
ipa
very
solid
stuff
o
i
like
it
a
lot
bitter
sweet
and
compelling
strong
noticeably
alcoholic
but
no
less
desirable
for
that
rather
fun
worth
picking
up
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
really
good
tasting
aba
i
would
drink
it
again
im
not
sure
what
the
whole
brewed
with
hemp
seed
thing
is
about
because
i
didnt
notice
anything
particular
about
it
in
the
beer
anyway
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
pine
character
to
it
so
if
you
enjoy
those
hop
flavors
you
will
most
likely
enjoy
this
beer
the
malt
roasted
presence
is
also
there
without
being
overdone
d
very
nice
black
ipa
great
overall
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
roasted
flavors
overall
a
good
if
strong
example
of
an
american
black
ale
this
might
even
be
better
classified
as
a
strong
ale
i
would
have
this
again
o
4
5
i
have
had
my
fair
share
of
these
in
the
last
few
years
an
exceptional
black
ipa
and
the
price
point
is
great
i
readily
recommend
if
you
like
dark
hoppy
beers
it
holds
its
own
as
far
as
the
hemp
seed
oil
i
better
not
fail
a
drug
test
from
drinking
this
drink
responsibly
o
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
o
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
and
am
glad
i
picked
this
up
this
is
a
very
good
american
black
ale
im
currently
having
some
horseradish
cheese
along
with
this
and
am
really
loving
how
they
both
go
well
together
at
least
in
my
opinion
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
the
utah
liquor
store
in
sugar
house
the
body
on
this
beer
was
great
largely
due
to
the
increased
abv
no
doubt
which
made
it
an
ideal
beer
to
be
enjoyed
slowly
nice
bitterness
but
again
not
as
biting
as
i
might
expect
from
this
style
pleased
overall
will
seek
out
again
pours
an
abysmal
black
opaque
against
the
light
head
is
tan
a
quarter
finger
that
settles
to
nearly
cover
the
top
grassy
astringent
barkish
earthy
hops
i
get
the
feeling
this
is
going
to
be
brutally
bitter
in
taste
some
sweet
chocolate
notes
and
slight
caramel
from
the
hops
bakers
chocolate
and
caramel
malt
start
the
flavor
yielding
to
bitter
root
almost
licorice
the
hop
bitterness
is
barkish
earthy
and
is
accompanied
by
strong
alcohol
presence
beneath
everything
is
some
nectar
or
sweet
honey
from
one
of
the
hop
varieties
finish
is
balanced
leaving
you
with
dark
chocolate
and
licorice
definitely
a
fan
of
this
but
it
is
very
strong
both
in
flavor
and
abv
everyone
i
know
raves
about
it
as
the
name
suggests
its
brewed
with
hemp
seed
and
it
tastes
like
they
tried
to
cram
every
kind
of
flavor
into
the
bottle
sickly
sweet
and
overly
bitterand
it
smells
like
old
pineapple
mixed
with
moldy
hops
i
really
dont
see
how
anyone
can
enjoy
this
hodgepodge
of
flavors
this
is
really
tasty
im
glad
to
have
this
available
here
in
maine
overall
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
the
roast
malt
and
hops
play
well
together
with
the
hops
taking
center
stage
very
interesting
brew
tried
a
year
later
and
the
roast
malt
and
chocolate
stand
out
more
and
citrus
notes
are
tamer
than
i
recall
still
a
great
beer
this
is
an
incredibly
well
balanced
black
ipa
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
often
o
what
a
great
example
of
what
a
black
ipa
should
be
very
nice
balance
easy
to
drink
and
plenty
of
alcohol
i
like
it
a
lot
o
a
solid
black
dipa
that
delivers
its
worth
a
buy
black
in
color
with
mahogany
tones
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
reduced
to
a
nice
cap
that
left
random
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
pungent
pine
and
citrus
hop
aromas
with
grainy
dark
roasted
malt
aromas
beneath
thick
oily
feel
up
front
that
transitioned
to
a
grainy
reisnous
feel
at
the
end
pungent
pine
and
citrus
mostly
pine
that
ride
over
dark
roasted
malts
the
hop
and
dark
malts
ceate
an
intense
but
flavorful
bitterness
finishes
cleanly
with
a
dark
roasted
malt
roasted
coffee
and
pine
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
that
is
a
nice
contrast
to
the
smooth
sweet
feel
of
the
grains
hops
are
present
and
nicely
acidic
but
could
always
be
more
for
my
taste
a
solid
brew
thats
worth
checking
out
o
im
usually
not
very
fond
of
this
beer
style
but
this
one
is
an
exception
a
must
try
imperial
black
ipa
with
hemp
seeds
this
is
a
really
unique
brew
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
smooth
looking
color
with
a
very
excited
tan
head
on
top
that
stays
for
awhile
leaving
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
not
hops
right
away
but
a
complex
combination
of
malts
chocolate
and
toast
come
up
first
and
maybe
even
some
oats
or
something
there
is
a
gentle
sweetness
too
followed
by
a
growing
bitterness
the
whole
thing
culminates
in
a
powerfully
delicious
brew
notes
of
coffee
and
burnt
bagel
at
the
end
with
the
bitter
hops
and
a
scarily
well
hidden
alcohol
potency
that
makes
a
4
pack
tough
to
get
through
without
being
dickered
velvet
gentle
mouthfeel
just
enough
bubbles
for
it
to
not
be
heavy
full
body
but
not
weighty
at
all
overall
a
sensational
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
uinta
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
do
again
as
good
as
any
black
ipa
i
have
had
to
date
very
easy
drinking
despite
the
high
abv
love
the
hop
blast
paired
with
chocolate
malt
almost
could
be
considered
an
imperial
stout
really
good
black
ipa
not
too
many
negatives
at
all
glad
i
have
four
of
these
uinta
is
just
so
good
overall
an
excellent
beer
o
great
interpretation
of
a
black
ipa
the
mouthfeel
i
expect
not
as
thick
or
bitter
as
a
stout
with
a
hop
presence
that
is
richly
bitter
but
not
overtoptaste
that
sits
on
pallet
taking
away
from
the
malts
o
a
bottle
was
gifted
to
me
and
im
sad
i
havent
been
able
to
find
it
on
my
own
this
is
a
great
brew
not
popping
with
flavor
but
a
real
easy
drinker
for
an
imperial
plus
the
creaminess
is
something
i
dont
usually
see
in
black
ipas
and
it
is
a
great
fit
o
a
very
good
black
ale
with
plenty
of
hops
and
enough
malts
to
keep
it
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
abv
i
say
we
have
a
winner
here
o
a
great
black
ipa
very
hop
this
is
the
second
beer
i
have
tried
from
uinta
and
this
is
much
better
than
the
first
will
pick
this
up
again
bitter
herbal
minty
hops
up
front
wallop
of
sweetish
roasty
caramely
malt
barrels
in
hops
turn
more
citrusy
but
with
plenty
of
resinous
pine
in
tow
finish
is
a
mix
of
coffee
and
hop
bitterness
some
lingering
sticky
malt
mediumfull
body
with
a
very
creamy
feel
very
well
done
o
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
again
id
say
this
one
ends
up
a
bit
more
on
the
ipa
side
of
the
spectrum
nice
hop
flavor
here
decent
not
mindblowing
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
i
enjoy
how
the
roast
plays
a
role
in
flavor
rather
than
simply
adding
color
well
i
can
see
why
people
talk
this
beer
up
its
nice
to
see
beers
that
really
go
all
the
way
out
and
exceed
all
others
but
its
also
nice
to
see
beers
that
can
match
style
parameters
without
having
to
be
showy
or
out
there
to
prove
a
point
i
can
definitely
suggest
this
one
overall
this
an
amazing
aba
probably
the
best
one
i
have
ever
had
the
alcohol
is
barely
present
and
the
roasted
character
shines
through
remarkably
something
i
will
have
to
pick
up
again
whenever
i
can
find
it
o
good
stuff
i
like
it
really
roasty
like
this
very
close
to
being
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
an
american
black
ale
though
i
have
to
say
the
claimed
109
ibus
really
make
this
a
palateshredder
tempted
to
lower
the
score
here
to
4
0
based
on
drinkability
concerns
but
i
think
ill
leave
it
at
4
5
for
an
overall
positive
impression
d
pretty
well
done
the
hop
character
is
nice
with
a
pine
character
that
works
well
with
the
roast
the
malt
character
is
if
anything
too
roasty
which
is
the
opposite
of
the
problem
most
black
ipa
seem
to
suffer
from
o
nice
aba
i
like
t
how
you
can
actually
taste
the
pronounced
roast
unlike
many
abas
that
are
to
hop
centric
drinkability
this
is
a
palatewrecker
of
a
brew
and
one
to
take
on
most
likely
at
the
end
of
a
sampling
or
as
the
last
pint
at
a
bar
though
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
uintas
doing
a
lot
of
great
things
here
and
this
is
the
kind
id
go
back
to
complex
nuanced
and
strong
a
good
balance
that
if
done
right
can
be
a
kind
of
weird
but
very
pleasurable
experience
for
the
palate
and
im
looking
forward
to
trying
more
across
the
board
in
the
future
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
lighter
roast
and
some
pine
hops
in
the
taste
a
small
hop
and
a
small
caramel
like
roast
a
hop
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
pine
hop
and
caramel
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
nice
roast
and
big
pine
hops
hides
the
alcohol
and
pleasant
poured
hard
from
bottle
into
a
founders
pint
glass
loads
of
light
tan
head
with
considerable
lacing
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
coloring
with
hints
of
deep
red
from
a
distance
this
would
appear
to
be
a
stout
look
is
fantastic
smell
is
great
too
hints
of
smoke
but
mostly
i
get
sweet
floral
hops
with
some
malt
and
maybe
a
bit
of
caramel
it
smells
nothing
like
it
looks
i
suppose
overall
smell
is
typical
of
an
imperial
ipa
taste
is
similar
like
a
smokey
iipa
and
incredibly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
little
bite
and
carbonation
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
one
bottle
dubhe
poured
a
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
sized
creamy
tan
head
their
was
a
nice
strong
smokey
burnt
floral
aroma
the
taste
had
strong
bold
hop
flavors
with
a
strong
smokey
malty
undertone
that
finished
bitter
and
dry
nice
strong
flavors
and
could
drink
a
few
of
these
easily
overall
a
fantastic
black
ale
overall
this
has
been
great
every
time
ive
had
it
a
standout
for
the
style
at
a
pretty
good
price
the
hops
are
the
showcase
but
good
flavor
all
around
smoothe
easily
drinkable
if
you
dont
mind
the
bitter
hops
on
the
end
if
i
look
for
it
i
can
tell
that
theres
a
strong
booze
presence
but
its
not
readily
apparent
brewed
with
hemp
seeds
huh
12

pours
crystal
clear
very
dark
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice
2

dense
khaki
head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice

that
lasts
some
nice

lacing
clings
to
the
glass
aromas
of
big
grapefruit
pine
orange

herbal
floral
roasted

chocolate

damn
nice
aromas
with
good

very
inviting
and
hoppy
taste
of
pine

chocolate
roasted

herbal

roasted

char
pine

on

flavors
long
resinous
hop
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
fairly
creamy
and
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
black
ipa
very
nice
hop
flavor
profile
with
a
good
balance
of
roasted
malt
very
enjoyable
offering
o
i
love
dipas
and
i
love
stouts
but
hybridize
the
two
into
a
black
ale
and
the
results
can
be
questionable
at
times
see
stone
ssr
this
on
the
other
hand
is
an
example
of
the
style
done
right
very
well
priced
for
what
it
is
and
highly
recommended
even
at
three
months
old
this
is
damn
good
stuff
overall
i
highly
recommend
trying
this
o
i
would
consider
this
a
highly
hopped
robust
porter
as
opposed
to
black
ipa
but
whatever
really
digging
this
though
nothing
overwhelms
and
it
seems
like
a
carefully
crafted
flavor
profile
as
opposed
to
kitchen
sink
like
some
of
these
black
ipas
highly
reccomended
for
porter
ipa
or
ris
fans
o
another
unique
and
complex
brew
from
uinta
i
prefer
the
hop
notch
but
this
is
a
fine
alternative
for
someone
seeking
a
complex
dark
ipa
certainly
one
of
the
better
in
the
style
a
big
well
balanced
beer
thats
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
really
complex
beer
and
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
cda
style
the
flavor
goes
on
and
on
i
can
only
recommend
this
for
the
adventurous
sort
as
the
flavors
are
really
intense
those
that
can
handle
it
will
be
rewarded
i
also
suggest
trying
it
fresh
o
aggressively
bitter
even
for
hop
heads
nice
roast
coffee
character
overall
this
is
a
balanced
version
if
a
black
ipa
but
is
another
good
beer
from
uinta
obig
beer
that
has
a
bit
of
a
kick
but
definitely
delicious
highly
recommended
overall
very
enjoyable
and
worth
coming
back
to
o
this
might
just
be
the
best
cascadian
dark
ive
had
i
love
this
beer
as
its
much
more
hop
forward
then
many
instyle
id
have
this
one
tap
in
the
bottle
or
drizzled
into
my
mouth
by
a
gorgeous
female
porn
star
a
delicious
beer
id
ask
for
in
my
fivestar
suite
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
i
think
i
only
had
21st
amendment
back
in
black
and
wasnt
a
fan
so
ive
avoided
them
this
is
definitely
better
than
what
i
remember
the
back
in
black
to
be
anyway
i
really
am
enjoying
the
warmth
from
this
one
even
though
its
the
hottest
day
of
the
summer
it
rained
and
cooled
off
a
bit
this
is
kind
of
what
this
beer
feels
like
a
summer
night
that
turned
on
you
for
the
better
a
good
beer
yet
a
bit
too
strong
in
the
overall
bitterness
and
alcohol
heat
for
me
o
excellent
black
ipa
extremely
hoppy
dark
ale
overall
this
a
very
tasty
and
exceedingly
well
balanced
black
ipa
and
one
of
the
better
imperial
versions
of
the
style
complex
in
flavor
and
drinkable
for
the
abv
this
beer
reminds
me
why
i
love
this
style
recommended
to
any
fan
of
the
style
or
any
ba
looking
to
get
into
the
gray
area
that
is
the
american
black
ale
cheers
beer
is
mediumheavy
bodied
with
moderate
but
very
soft
carbonation
creating
an
overall
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
ethanol
is
rather
prevalent
from
midpalate
through
the
aftertaste
in
the
nostrils
and
throat
in
the
form
of
heat
and
slight
burning
nothing
overthetop
and
well
hidden
for
a
9
2
beer
but
it
still
detracts
somewhat
from
experiencing
the
other
flavors
scents
and
feel
of
the
beer
finish
is
dry
with
a
slight
stickiness
across
the
palate
o
just
the
second
uinta
brew
i
have
had
but
so
far
i
am
impressed
at
three
months
old
the
hops
were
not
as
prominent
as
i
assume
they
intended
119
ibu
however
the
malt
flavors
carried
this
one
and
made
for
a
brilliantly
balanced
beer
i
look
forward
to
trying
a
fresher
one
but
this
was
very
good
overall
a
nice
hoppy
black
ipa
very
well
done
not
sure
if
hemp
is
noticed
as
hops
smell
like
nice
kind
bud
anyway
but
very
enjoyable
overall
earth
wind
and
beer
very
cool
hemp
seed
makes
an
interesting
addition
o
im
on
and
off
with
american
black
ales
never
sure
what
ill
like
but
this
was
a
winner
perfectly
melds
the
citrus
pine
hoppiness
of
a
dipa
with
the
bitter
espresso
dryness
of
an
american
black
ale
overall
though
the
hemp
seed
is
an
appreciated
added
ingredient
its
for
me
completely
lost
amidst
the
hard
roastiness
and
heavy
hoppiness
its
black
its
high
on
the
alcohol
scale
and
its
bitter
thats
in
these
days
right
overall
finally
a
good
black
ipa
so
many
arent
hoppy
some
are
just
ipas
and
you
arent
sure
how
it
is
a
black
ipa
perhaps
you
need
an
imperial
ipa
to
create
the
right
balance
whatever
the
formula
this
one
has
characteristics
of
both
fresh
from
chicago
trip
pours
black
with
generous
foam
resulting
in

the

lends
it
a
little
roap
and
dryness
otherwise
a
black

all
the

just
a
higher

good

overall
the
strawberry

note
doesnt
work
all
that
well
with
the
other
black

flavours
for
me
its
still
a
fantastic
beer
i
just
expected
more
due
to
how
much
i
enjoyed
their

notch
a
dark
amber
in
to
my
glass
capped
by
an
off
white
head
nose
is
piney
toasty
and
chocolate
taste
is
intense
bitterness
of
pine
citrus
and
earth
with
in
a
caramel
chocolate
and
toasty
back
bone
wish
it
were
a
bit
more
balanced
this
beer
epitomizes
the
notion
of
a
sipper
i
would
say
it
was
enjoyable
but
would
seek
something
else
if
i
were
looking
for
a
sipper
this
beer
is
black
as
midnight
with
a
thin
head
that
leaves
just
a
touch
of
lacing
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
malt
forward
with
tones
of
alcohol
and
some
hops
although
they
are
not
the
headliner
the
flavor
starts
with
malt
moves
to
a
little
heat
from
the
alcohol
with
a
nice
balanced
bitterness
after
the
bitterness
subsides
you
get
a
great
nuttycoffee
flavor
really
nice
you
can
tell
that
this
was
well
brewed
and
precisely
attenuated
the
mouthfeel
is
just
rich
enough
without
being
sweet
and
syrupyeee
overall
a
very
enjoyable
balanced
entry
into
the
black

cascadian
dark

series
whatever
you
want
to
call
it

overpowered
by

this
is
far
too
easy
to
drink
o
im
a
bit
perplexed
by
my
initial
impression
and
the
subsequent
changes
still
for
the
majority
of
the
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
quality
example
of
a
style
thats
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
overall
a
very
impressive
dankstyle
ipa
reminds
me
of
resin
or
dales
deviant
not
quite
as
sticky
but
the
dry
clean
finish
is
very
welcome
o
a
really
nice
black
ipa
satisfying
hoppy
yet
out
of
balance
interesting
with
the
hemp
and
the
label
art
is
pretty
cool
not
an
everyday
drinker
but
lots
of
intrigue
and
quite
pleasant
could
see
beers
like
this
acting
as
gateways
for
people
who
already
like
beer
but
not
dark
beer
dark
brown
with
some
ruby

says
this
was
made
with
hemp

and
some

notes
are
present
as
well
pine

and
some

medium

with

sweeter
than
some

but
fairly
tasty
really
tasty
black
ipa
tons
of
flavor
and
balances
the
hops
and
dark
malts
very
well
one
of
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
drinkability
uinta
did
a
good
job
on
this
with
the
excellent
color
and
great
balance
its
just
like
an
earthy
stout
mixed
with
a
well
balance
strong
ipa
its
up
there
with
stones
sublimely
self
righteous
overall
this
beer
was
excellent
its
great
to
see
utah
brewers
trying
new
things
the
hemp
seeds
provided
a
nice
touch
it
is
nice
to
see
the
crazy
utah
theocratic
lawmakers
allow
brewers
to
make
proper
abv
beer
that
can
only
be
sold
in
state
run
stores
pain
in
the
booty
when
visiting
unfortunately
any
beer
above
4
abv
is
only
available
in
a
state
run
liquor
store
you
can
buy
beer
in
supermarkets
at
4
and
below
only
if
you
ever
go
to
utah
i
seldomly
do
find
out
where
the
liquor
stores
are
and
buy
a
pack
of
dubhe
it
goes
well
with
beef
and
nacho
chipswsalsa
and
spicy
guacamole
i
recommend
this
ale
cheers
o
a
terrific
black
ipa
a
style
where
brewers
often
flop
imo
ill
seek
this
out
again
in
the
future
o
this
was
my
first
imperial
black
ipa
and
i
can
say
i
definitely
appreciate
the
style
its
much
more
than
as
some
people
say
just
an
imperial
ipa
with
dark
coloring
the
toastiness
adds
a
nice
touch
i
can
see
myself
drinking
this
on
a
cool
fall
evening
although
the
sweetness
makes
me
want
to
only
have
one
i
personally
would
like
a
little
thinner
body
a
well
done
american
black
ale
the
hop
character
blends
nicely
into
the
malt
notes
overall
this
is
my
first
ever
uinta
offering
and
after
having
my
doubts
being
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
i
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
and
would
definately
both
have
again
and
recommend
o
tasty
complex
beer
got
a
lot
of
things
going
for
it
will
buy
again
especially
since
i
got
it
for
like
two
dollars
o
i
wouldnt
say
that
the
beer
is
balanced
but
it
is
good
i
like
the
bold
hops
bitterness
and
the
rich
malt
flavor
i
need
to
drink
sublimely
selfrighteous
again
and
to
review
it
to
see
how
it
holds
up
on
tap
at
slaters
5050
in
san
diego
pours
a
dark
black
with
adequate
head
and
lacing
aroma
is
a
nice
oily
piney
roasted
malty
sensory
boost
taste
is
a
little
more
hoppy
than
most
ive
had
from
this
style
with
pine
and
citrus
dominating
the
roasted
coffee
and
subtle
cocoa
malt
mouthfeel
is
smooth
a
bit
boozy
and
warming
liked
this
one
would
have
it
again
o
pretty
decent
brew
its
a
little
on
the
hot
and
bitter
side
but
good
overall
a
solid
blackbrown
colored
dipa
with
a
decent
chocolateytan
head
that
settles
to
a
respectae
foam
cap
with
a
nice
chunky
lace
in
retreat
the
aroma
is
quite
evident
and
brings
deep
earthy
malt
with
tropical
fruit
and
citrus
hop
highlights
woodsy
and
herbal
and
a
bit
of
licorice
this
gets
the
digestive
juices
going
very
edible
the
taste
buds
pick
up
on
near
peaty
earthiness
with
more
of
a
hint
of
chocolatelicorice
and
the
hops
take
on
more
of
the
herbalseaweed
side
for
a
pungent
somewhat
swampfunk
it
mostly
comes
down
to
a
herbalgrassy
sort
of
hop
bite
that
is
somewhat
mellowed
by
the
root
beer
malt
it
takes
a
little
getting
used
to
the
flavors
but
they
settle
down
and
its
definitely
a
goody
its
a
mediumplus
bodied
brew
with
modest
carbonation
for
a
satiny
smooth
feel
very
enjoyable
after
taking
in
the
aroma
i
wasnt
sure
i
would
enjoy
this
more
so
than
other
abas
ive
had
the
hops
were
overly
dominant
and
i
thought
it
wouldnt
have
enough
malt
to
stand
up
to
the
hops
upon
tasting
it
though
it
proved
me
wrong
a
great
black
ale
overall
the
dry
yet
smooth
palate
helps
lubricate
the
palate
for
a
long
slow
sip
of
bitter
pleasure
it
was
very
enjoyable
but
it
kinda
felt
like
something
was
missing
too
im
not
sure
what
but
i
would
like
to
pick
this
up
again
overall
what
a
fantastic
beer
i
am
contemplative
after
every
sip
there
is
so
much
depth
and
complexity
here
but
so
completely
well
balanced
i
would
not
recommend
having
weaker
styles
after
one
of
these
as
it
will
dominate
your
palate
but
in
a
most
wonderful
way
my
favorite
style
is
a
nice
dipa
and
this
has
some
nice
similarities
hop
lovers
take
note
this
is
a
must
try
overall
a
very
good
black
ale
probably
second
to
odell
mountain
standard
but
both
are
worth
a
try
if
you
have
them
in
your
area
6252014had
it
on
tap
and
it
looked
amazing
smelled
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
citrus
hops
and
tasted
of
fresh
citrus
and
floral
hops
mixed
with
cocoa
powder
burnt
coffee
brown
sugar
charcoal
and
toffee
damn
tasty
black
ipa
that
had
perfect
mix
of
hops
and
malts
along
with
perfect
balance
overall
nice
beer
to
satisfy
your
hop
craving
o
aggressive
black
ipa
but
really
enjoyable
the
big
full
body
of
the
beer
is
necessary
to
contain
all
the
complexities
within
it
quite
a
tongue
slapper
some
of
the
flavors
play
off
eachother
in
a
unique
way
while
others
are
just
bizarre
not
exactly
a
layered
taste
experience
but
not
a
well
blended
one
either
overall
good
and
incredibly
unique
but
not
something
id
buy
again
this
one
space
visit
was
strange
enough
overall
i
would
totally
consider
it
again
but
its
one
of
those
halftime
beverage
beers
so
i
will
have
to
pick
up
a
few
when
they
have
another
free
shipping
offer
o
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
representation
of
the
style
and
hides
its
alcohol
quite
well
o
a
nice
double
black
ipa
and
my
first
for
the
style
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
strong
on
the
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
was
slightly
unmasked
but
overall
it
was
good
perhaps
my
only
critique
of
this
offering
is
that
the
harshness
of
the
alcohol
on
the
finish
was
a
bit
overdone
overall
it
was
very
good
nice
amount
of
strong
bitterness
but
a
mild
sweetness
that
complemented
the
flavor
overall
this
is
fantastic
beer
and
should
be
on
any
hop
heads
must
try
list
perhaps
more
brewers
should
consider
using
hemp
seed
because
this
beer
is
so
well
blended
that
the
massive
ibus
come
across
cleanly
even
if
a
little
bitey
well
worth
seeking
out
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
even
though
im
not
a
fan
of
black
ipas
9
for
a
four
pack
and
it
was
bottled

so
it
was
about
seven

at
the
point
i
drank
it
dark
black
color
which
is
no
surprise
decent
head
smells
slightly
hoppy
roasted
malt
not
bad
at
all
i
like
it
already
taste
is
oily
citrus
kind
of
sweet
not
bad
and
exactly
what
i
like
from
a
strong
black
ipa
overall
ill
buy
this
again

in
a

with
a

not

as

enough
to
balance
the
flavor
and
support
the
hops
a
tasty
well
made
ipa
overall
a
nice
and
piney
black
ale
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
differentodd
but
that
is
the
only
thing
holding
this
one
back
and
even
that
is
not
enough
to
offset
the
rest
of
this
great
tasting
beer
a
solid
beer
that
i
will
get
again
12oz

pours

with

when
held
to
the
light
nice
fluffy
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
and
leaves
a
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
floral
hops
and
roasted
malts
with
some
hemp
but
i
feel
its
my
head
playing
tricks
on
me
because
i
know
its
in
there
tastes
are
nice
and
full
with
a
rich
complexity
of
roasted
malt
loads
of
pungent
pine
and
grapefruity
hops
with
some
notes
of
bakers
chocolate
and
hemp
with
a
hint
of
white
pepper
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
creamy
and
smooth
with
an
oily
and
astringent
finish
overall
im
very
impressed
with
this
uinta
offering
i
havent
been
to
thrilled
with
some
of
their
other
stuff
ive
tried
and
was
ready
give
up
on
them
but
this
is
a
definite
musttry
remarkable
finish
this
beer
is
better
on
tap
than
i
remember
the
bottle
to
be
gooey
resin
like
presence
of
sweet
and
tart
combined
there
is
a
competition
between
the
chocolate
bittersweet
and
the
hop
citrus
that
is
at
the
same
time
piney
a
lingering
finish
amazing
beer
pours
a
really
dark
red
just
enough
color
to
see
through
the
scent
has
a
bit
of
malt
and
some
liquor
for
having
a
liquor
scent
this
is
a
really
smooth
drink
creamy
texture
something
you
could
sip
on
but
at
the
abv
its
at
itll
sneak
up
and
kill
you
recommended
for
anyone
that
can
get
one
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
decent
along
with
the
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
gave
of
some
hoppy
notes
along
with
a
good
amount
of
coffeechocolate
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
well
balanced
with
the
bitterness
and
the
rich
roasted
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
slightly
creamy
had
a
light
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
i
wasnt
able
to
really
find
what
hemp
seed
tastes
like
though
from
it
this
took
a
while
to
down
because
it
was
so
strong
but
this
grew
on
my
quickly
i
love
how
this
style
has
taken
off
and
anyone
looking
for
a
good
representation
would
not
need
to
look
any
further
than
here
boldness
works
with
this
brew
and
the
outside
clearly
matches
whats
on
the
inside
of
the
bottle
beautiful
and
certainly
not
to
be
missed
o
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
unita
at
a
very
affordable
price
very
easy
to
drink
try
this
one
of
you
are
into
abas
poured
a
black
color
this
iep
have
an
inch
of
head
in
the
appropriate
glassware
the
citrusy
aroma
was
quite
pontent
with
definitive
scents
of
grapefruit
and
a
mild
burntnutty
type
scent
the
initial
taste
was
biscuity
but
that
taste
quickly
melted
into
more
potent
tastes
chocolate
and
citrus
hops
were
dominant
with
a
reasonably
smooth
mouthfeel
it
was
a
little
like
one
of
those
chocolate
orange
slice
things
except
the
flavor
of
this
ipa
screams
for
your
attention
dark
chocolate
haunts
the
aftertaste
with
hints
of
the
hops
still
hanging
around
in
this
sense
the
chocolately
flavors
overpowered
the
hops
too
much
o
overall
decent
example
of
a
black
ale
i
tend
not
to
be
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
burnt
flavors
interfere
a
bit
too
much
with
my
american
hop
flavors
i
would
call
this
a
well
made
but
fairly
typical
example
of
the
style
if
you
enjoy
black
ales
definitely
give
this
one
a
chance
served
from

a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
half
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
quickly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
citrus
roasted
malt
citrus
hop
and
pine
the
flavor
was
of

citrus
citrus

pine
pine

and
alcohol
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
the
aroma
on
this
one
was
what
one
would
expect
from
this
style
with
a
nice
hoppiness
and
a
nice
roastiness
on
top
of
that
the
flavor
on
this
one
was
pretty
nice
and
hoppy
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
on
the
followthrough
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
or
are
a
curious
hophead
pours
black
good
head
lace
not
blown
away
by
the
smell
but
this
beer
opens
up
with
tasty
roast
black
and
chocolate
malts
followed
by
a
nice
hoppy
earthy
very
dank
with
biting
bitterness
impressive

pak
would
purchase
again
most
balanced
ipas
start
with
hops
and
finish
with
malt
but
this
seems
to
be
the
opposite
the
toasted
and
chocolate
are
first
out
of
the
box
and
the
pine
and
grapefruit
come
in
the
finish
and
aftertaste
considering
this
sucker
clocks
in
at
9
2
it
holds
up
quite
well
which
is
a
credit
to
the
mouthfeel
my
brother
was
right
on
i
could
easily
get
into
trouble
with
this
beer
as
it
isnt
harsh
or
withering
and
is
immensely
smooth
and
sessionable
for
the
octane
o
its
ok
but
there
s
better
bipas
out
there
odell
mountain
standard
and
loose
cannon
come
to
mind
notes
very
solid
all
the
way
through
the
fruitiness
is
well
paired
with
the
sweetness
a
nice
drinkable
beer
cheers
a
dark
amber
in
to
my
goblet
capped
by
an
off
white
head
nose
is
piney
toasty
and
chocolate
taste
is
intense
bitterness
of
pine
citrus
and
earth
with
in
a
caramel
chocolate
and
toasty
back
bone
wish
it
were
a
bit
more
balanced
this
beer
epitomizes
the
notion
of
a
sipper
i
would
say
it
was
enjoyable
but
would
seek
something
else
if
i
were
looking
for
a
sipper
o
this
is
probably
my
favor
regularly
produced
beer

you

taste
reminiscent
of
a
russian
imperial
stout
or
something
similar
to
nightstalker
by
goose
island
due
to
its
enormity
the
beer
has
a
slightly
elevated
roastchocolateacrid
note
the
beer
is
amazing
though
a
big
malt
profile
mingles
with
spicy
piney
resinous
hops
finishes
dry
with
the
roast
and
resin
hanging
around
on
the
palette
yum
a
nice
winter
beer
worth
seeking
out
again
i
usually
dont
like
black
ipas
but
this
is
excellent
a
sourish
taste
in
a
good
way
a
bit
of
cherry
mixed
in
a
slight
bitter
hop
taste
a
slight
caramel
sweetness
a
mild
porter
coffee
hint
in
there
nice
and
complex
pitch
black
body
with
some
lighter
bown
around
the
edges
a
half
finger
of
off
white
head
settles
down
to
a
thin
skin
on
top
with
some
lacing
but
not
much
big
pine
aromas
are
the
first
to
greet
the
nose
after
it
opens
up
i
can
detect
some
citrus
hops
cocoa
smoked
malts
and
hemp
all
these
things
blend
well
to
create
an
outstanding
flavor
sticky
hemp
and
oily
hops
create
a
full
bodied
feel
with
good
carbonation
has
a
dry
smokey
finish
with
a
pine
after
taste
this
is
a
really
good
beer
big
thanks
to
vegasbeerman
for
sending
this
as
an
extra
cheers
to
uinta
for
their
craft
upping
the
taste
to
4
5
and
the
overall
as
well
my
taste
has
come
around
to
this
a
little
more
and
throw
it
up
against
stone
sublimely
self
righteous
and
i
think
this
comes
out
on
top
the
abv
is
a
little
high
but
this
is
the
best
black
ipa
out
there
overall
it
very
nice
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
didnt
have
the
hops
i
was
looking
for
though
a
black
beer
with
red
highlights
and
a
very
short
head
this
one
ended
up
being
a
lot
more
enjoyable
than
it
appeared
on
the
pour
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
a
roasted
malt
quality
cereal
and
breadcrust
malt
grapefruit
and
pine
cones
nice
theres
not
as
much
alcohol
in
the
aroma
as
i
expected
given
the
abv
the
taste
however
has
a
serious
kick
lots
of
bitterness
booze
and
highly
roastedburnt
flavors
warming
the
beer
is
substantial
and
has
a
massively
intense
backtaste
very
enjoyable
oan
interesting
black
ipa
with
nice
balance
overall
great
flavor
profile
big
brew
overall
not
bad
but
too
many
different
flavors
that
dont
mesh
well
at
all
the
hemp
seeds
are
weird
on
their
own
and
the
piney
hops
as
well
as
citrus
and
want
to
be
grapefruit
hops
curdle
the
creamy
dark
malt
almost
porter
like
background
that
dont
blend
nearly
as
well
as
other
abas
then
theres
the
super
bitter
astringent
finish
dark
unsweetened
chocolate
bitter
and
resiny
leafy
greens
pine
underlying
toasty
malt
sweetness
that
tempers
the
bitterness
a
little
very
smooth
and
supple
feel
lightly
sticky
on
the
lips
medium
to
full
bodied
alcohol
is
hidden
sipping
is
easy
the
full
flavors
encourage
slow
savoring
this
is
a
really
nice
black
ipa
its
very
cohesive
with
equally
vibrant
hop
greenery
and
deep
roasted
malt
complexity
will
look
for
more
of
this
before
its
gone
12

mouthfeel

good
beer
this
one
of
the
better
takes
on
the
black
ipa
style
that
ive
had
in
a
while
with
those
fresh
hops
right
at
the
front
and
center
this
was
a
pretty
fresh
bottle
and
it
showed
while
those
darker
malts
sitting
along
the
back
and
compliment
them
just
as
they
should
be
if
they
would
dial
the
abv
back
a
bit
this
may
well
could
be
one
of
the
best
that
ive
had
i
really
enjoyed
it
o
a
good
beer
but
as
mentioned
in
the
taste
critique
slightly
less
roast
character
and
more
hops
would
align
more
closely
with
my
definition
of
imperial
black
ipa
pours
a
dark
black
liquid
with
a
frothy
beige
head
and
slight
lacing
barleywine
anyone
totally
has
the
aroma
and
whiffs
of
a
barleywine
with
some
dark
malts
in
the
mix
slight
candy
figs
and
wood
also
abundent
the
taste
is
very
nice
smokey
taste
with
some
hearty
roasted
malts
some
leather
and
a
nice
coffee
beanespresso
swallow
and
aftertaste
the
hoppiness
is
there
if
you
need
it
pretty
chewy
mouthfeel
overall
i
was
again
impressed
with
another
uinta
brew
i
had
no
clue
about
this
brewery
until
a
little
over
a
year
ago
but
i
am
a
fan
good
stuff
here
and
it
has
hemp
seed
1
o
overall
roasty
hoppy
with
a
nice
finish
good
drinkability
pours
a
nice
black
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
light
tan
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
hoppy
with
some
malt
notes
licorice
slight
toffee
note
caramel
the
taste
is
pretty
hoppy
lots
of
licorice
and
malts
medium
body
the
finish
is
dry
and
bitter
this
is
an
pretty
tasty
brew
one
of
uintas
best
it
wont
blow
your
mind
away
but
wont
be
a
huge
letdown
overall
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
bitter
yet
a
balanced
after
this
is
a
style
i
have
never
been
a
big
fan
of
but
this
one
is
probably
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
so
far
well
done
uinta
i
will
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
amazing
job
on
this
one
overall
i
enjoyed
the
beer
i
like
the
big
piney
flavor
here
and
the
beer
looks
very
nice
as
well
everything
else
about
this
beer
is
slightly
lacking
though
the
flavor
isnt
anything
to
behold
it
bitterweet
but
with
a
lot
of
both
the
chocolate
bread
flavor
just
doesnt
mesh
with
the
hops
i
like
the
bitterness
and
the
mouthfeel
but
this
recipe
seems
unthoughtout
m
not
overly
bitter
rather
smooth
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
finish
id
love
to
see
them
increase
the
mouthfeel
a
tad
to
make
it
a
bit
chewier
overall
another
great
brew
from
the
state
of
utah
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ipa
d
overall
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
with
this
beer
if
you
like
black
ipas
this
is
a
musthave
unique
complex
full
of
character
and
fun
to
drink
its
an
opaque
black
with
a
dark
brown
head
and
smells
like
pine
and
roast
depth
of
earthy
nutty
and
chicory
flavor
from
the
dark
malt
and
then
the
citrus
hops
offer
an
amazing
brightness
and
bitterness
its
all
kind
of
hot
but
comes
together
well
with
a
sticky
but
wellcarbonated
mouthfeel
every
flavor
is
in
excess
but
somehow
this
is
an
awesome
beer
melds
together
amazingly
notes
well
worth
the
recommendation
and
the
repeat
if
one
is
into
this
range
not
too
complex
or
hefty
but
in
this
case
that
might
like
the
asset
it
is
very
well
balanced
without
loosing
any
of
the
expected
assertiveness
of
the
style
the
hemp
is
there
but
very
softy
blending
well
with
the
herbal
hop
range
d
good
nose
and
flavors
but
definitely
a
sipper
wouldnt
exactly
call
this
super
drinkable
considering
i
feel
like
this
is
more
of
a
nightcap
overall
worth
grabbing
if
you
can
find
it
pours
pretty
damn
black
under
a
lovely
soapy
tan
head
that
leaves
behind
abundant
drippy
lacing
deep
dark
malty
aroma
with
pine
and
alcohol
sweet
chocolate
and
light
citrus
coffee
and
chocolate
upfront
in
the
flavor
followed
by
a
solid
resinous
wall
of
hoppy
bitterness
its
seeming
hoppier
with
each
sip
grapefruit
and
sticky
pine
along
with
some
charred
maltiness
smooth
mediumfull
body
with
an
oily
slickness
i
like
it
this
bottle
is
a
few
months
old
so
ill
likely
get
a
superfresh
one
with
the
fancy
new
label
and
see
how
it
compares
pour
is
solid
black
head
was
a
creamy
light

had
tons
of

crisp

and
bits

notes
but
a
much
stronger
stout

chocolate
roast
slight

body
was
full
and
almost
chewy
overall
a
fantastic
excursion
from
the
ordinary
at
over
10
for
a
4pack
its
not
for
everyday
drinking
but
i
will
be
bringing
this
to
the
next
poker
game
solid
medium
body
almost
creamy
just
a
little
warming
drinks
pretty
well
solid
from
uinta
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
khaki
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
primarily
of
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hops
with
some
roasted

as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
citrus
zest
and
spicy
herbal
hops
up

with
dark
roasted

and
cocoa
flavors
coming
in
with
the
aftertaste
a
mild
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ale
with
some
nice
hop
and
roasty
flavors
uinta
dubhe
pours
a
nearly
solid
black
when
properly
backlit
the
very
edge
of
the
beer
lightens
to
mahogany
theres
a
full
three
fingers
of
caramel
head
that
just
sits
there
for
a
minute
before
beginning
its
slow
decline
and
it
leaves
more
than
enough
lacing
against
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
nose
quickly
indicates
that
this
is
a
black
ipa
that
takes
some
flavor
from
dark
malts
as
opposed
to
just
color
as
there
are
definitely
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
present
in
the
aroma
the
hops
show
themselves
as
well
citrus
and
earthy
a
mild
coffee
and
chocolate
maltiness
leads
of
each
sip
the
mid
palate
bitterness
is
way
too
mild
it
doesnt
effectively
knock
back
the
malty
opening
and
the
sweetness
dampens
the
opening
of
the
hoppy
back
end
citrus
and
earth
in
a
fairly
even
blend
the
body
has
a
littel
bit
of
heft
to
it
which
in
and
of
itself
is
just
fine
but
that
ends
up
overwhelming
a
carbonation
level
thats
just
totally
inadequate
dubhe
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
the
lck
of
bitterness
and
dull
carbonation
make
it
not
nearly
as
crisp
as
most
ipas
black
or
otherwise
overall
this
is
just
a
fantastic
complex
beer
ive
never
been
big
on
black
ipas
but
they
dont
all
taste
this
good
thats
two
ive
had
from
uinta
and
i
am
impressed
so
far
i
live
in
northern
california
and
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
access
to
uinta
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
more
overall
a
real
strange
smelling
beer
but
makes
up
for
it
considerably
in
appearance
and
taste
its
like
a
good
mix
of
hoppy
ipa
and
stout
like
roast
and
chocolate
all
together
but
considerably
hop
forward
this
is
an
absolutely
cracking
brew
rich
and
smooth
but
bright
and
crisp
as
well
truly
this
is
a
hallmark
of
the
style
im
shocked
i
gave
away
my
first
bottle
dubhe
pours
into
the
glass
a
dark
brown
color
with
some
black
in
there
as
well
a
mix
of
the
two
leaning
towards
black
a
nice
loose
bubbled
dark
tan
foam
rose
up
and
retreated
after
some
minutes
okay
retention
weak
lacing
off
the
bat
this
does
not
smell
like
a
ipa
black
ale
is
a
good
term
for
this
beer
smells
grainy
roasty
with
some
small
storm
king
like
hop
scents
with
a
touch
of
the
9
2
coming
out
this
comes
off
like
a
hoppy
porter
with
some
tropics
of
a
ipa
without
exibiting
the
bitterness
of
one
feel
is
a
nice
healthy
medium
with
a
nice
carb
but
goes
down
smooth
and
not
bitter
im
glad
i
got
this
on
happy
hour
the
because
this
is
not
a
good
example
of
a
black
ipa
whatever
that
is
overall
a
nice
black
ipa
i
knew
i
would
not
be
disappointed
picking
up
a
four
pack
but
i
am
disappointed
i
did
not
pick
up
more
i
will
hunt
for
it
if
i
have
to
great
job
by
uinta
again
had
this
in
a
snifter
at
tjs
poured
redblack
with
a
smallish
mocha
head
which
dissipated
to
a
coating
lacing
was
ample
and
marked
every
sip
nose
was
citrus
some
sweetness
of
caramel
and
some
roasted
coffee
taste
was
grapefruit
pine
some
dark
chocolate
roasted
coffee
and
dark
fruit
mouthfeel
was
medium
dry
and
creamy
with
a
strong
bitterness
in
the
finish
carbonation
seemed
perfect
for
the
style
some
booziness
but
pleasant
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ipa
that
i
will
go
back
to
again
o
i
like
this
beer
and
would
love
to
have
it
again
but
their
are
a
few
other
black
ipas
that
id
prefer
over
this
beer
overall
this
may
be
my
favorite
american
black
ale
to
date
really
well
done
slainte
strong
and
flavorful
with
a
nice
boozy
warmth
very
solid
overall
overall
a
great
beer
o
a
complex
beer
with
a
lot
of
interesting
aromas
and
flavors
well
worth
checking
out
wow
a
pretty
darn
punchy
black
ipa
i
would
say
everything
kind
of
comes
back
to
that
point
the
roasted
malt
the
booze
which
is
very
well
integrated
and
the
big
boy
ipa
hop
craziness
nice
to
see
this
kind
of
hedonism
from
the
center
of
mormonia
pours
a
chalky
black
color
with
some
red
highlights
thin
cap
of
greyish
brown
head
nice
sticky
lacing
scent
is
near
balanced
between
piney
hops
and
roasted
grain
with
either
being
too
powerful
on
the
nose
taste
follows
suit
again
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
roast
bitter
pine
resin
and
heavy
roasted
grains
mix
and
mingle
to
create
a
smooth
and
balanced
flavor
profile
notes
of
citrus
cocoa
coffee
and
earth
present
in
some
form
light
fruityness
on
back
end
dry
perfect
carbonation
medium
bodied
one
of
the
better
and
more
highly
drinkable
black
ipas
on
the
market
overall
this
is
in
my
top
3
black
ipas
i
have
had
just
a
wonderful
beer
and
highly
recommended
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
pitch
black
a
very
nice
two
inch
sticky
light
tan
head
smell
is
pine
carmel
and
some
breadyness
taste
all
that
with
a
slight
roastyness
plenty
of
carbonation
and
body
wish
i
had
it
a
little
younger
it
was
bottled
on
62311
i
am
sure
the
hops
were
a
little
more
pronounced
two
months
ago
but
a
winner
either
way
this
beer
is
amazing
very
little
in
the
way
of
flaws
for
hop
heads
this
is
a
must
probably
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
out
there
a
good
simple
wellbalanced
black
ipa
a
very
good
beer
the
9
2
is
no
doubt
in
there
tasted
and
felt
for
hop
lovers
that
are
enjoying
this
blackcascadian
ipa
movement
this
is
a
must
try
overall
this
is
a
kick
ass
beer
i
like
hops
and
i
like
dark
beer
and
this
blends
them
really
nice
i
really
didnt
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
i
was
hoping
for
good
but
was
cautious
of
anyone
seeming
to
use
hemp
as
a
selling
point
i
always
feel
brewers
that
use
marijuana
leaves
on
the
packaging
are
hoping
for
a
certain
demographic
to
just
by
their
beer
based
on
that
fact
alone
feeling
that
making
an
actual
quality
beer
is
not
important
this
thankfully
was
not
the
case
this
is
just
another
example
of
a
superbly
wellcrafted
beer
from
uinta
they
are
rising
up
the
ranks
on
my
list
of
favorite
breweries
3
0
d
despite
my
efforts
ive
only
found
one
black
ipa
that
integrates
the
roast
and
the
hops
well
this
isnt
it
unfortunately
flavors
fighting
each
other
is
too
dangerous
for
this
to
continue
o
one
of
the
best
ive
had
really
savored
this
beer
and
i
look
forward
to
enjoying
another
soon
i
also
like
the
name
of
this
beer
named
for
a
star
in
ursa
major
cool
and
i
also
like
that
it
was
available
in
a
4pack
because
i
rarely
want
to
commit
to
a
6pack
and
sometimes
a
single
just
isnt
enough
to
give
the
full
impression
the
beer
deserves
but
now
that
im
34
the
way
through
the
4pack
i
think
ive
got
the
idea
well
done
black
with
about
an
inch
of
offwhite
head
which
stuck
around
for
about
a
quarter
of
the
glass
aroma
is
a
ton
of
dark
chocolate
that
seems
slightly
burnt
some
piney
hops
floating
in
the
back
but
nothing
standing
out
flavor
is
a
milky
dark
chocolate
at
first
but
transitions
quickly
to
a
bitter
chocolate
backed
by
a
earthy
dry
finish
the
middle
gave
way
to
some
sweeter
dark
flavors
with
some
smokey
tobacco
i
like
how
the
aroma
was
misleading
to
the
hop
character
im
ok
with
this
one
but
it
is
another
example
where
im
getting
increasingly
critical
of
how
this
style
is
made
this
black
imperial
ipa
is
well
made
but
over
the
top
in
hop
application
i
liked
it
but
i
also
know
id
be
reluctant
to
reach
for
2
right
away
not
bad
not
great
but
worth
a
try
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
bit
rough
on
the
palate
though
lingering
and
dry
i
find
black
ipas
to
be
very
hit
or
miss
but
i
was
into
this
one
definitely
more
on
the
aggressive
side
which
is
typically
how
i
like
it
i
love
this
beer
this
my
fourth
black
ipa
that
ive
tried
it
takes
the
cake
for
sure
o
this
beer
was
intense
but
it
is
definitely
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
thus
far
o
again
my
first
black
ipa
certainly
will
not
be
the
last
i
like
it
a
lot
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
black
ipa
and
although
it
was
very
good
sublimely
selfrighteous
still
holds
the
title
in
my
opinion
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
will
pick
up
some
more
next
time
i
see
it
this
is
on
par
with
sublimely
selfrighteous
perhaps
better
a
lot
of
the
black
ipas
ive
tried
seem
to
be
little
more
than
heavily
hopped
porters
but
this
one
is
definitely
crafted
a
lot
more
deliberately
o
good
beer
love
the
hops
and
the
bitter
both
the
sweetness
and
hops
balance
well
together
overall
the
different
elements
of
this
brew
are
holding
onto
each
other
for
dear
life
without
ever
letting
go
i
dig
it
and
i
envisioned
having
this
by
a
campfire
i
hope
to
make
that
come
true
some
day
smooth
and
with
a
light
bitterness
this
may
be
imperial
and
it
may
be
black
but
an
ipa
it
is
not
in
my
view
a
decent
brew
nonetheless
exagerated
pour
yielded
a
huge
head
of
mocha
colored
foam
that
permanently
laced
the
glass
dark
mahogany
with
a
slight
red
tint
smells
of
bread
and
plumprune
coffee
beans
yeast
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
not
too
hoppy
and
the
alcohol
is
not
overpowering
interesting
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
russian
imperial
stout
smooth
beginning
to
the
taste
then
the
black
patent
malts
show
up
after
that
is
the
alcohol
warmth
the
swallow
is
more
of
the
burnt
malts
with
a
light
hop
in
the
background
comes
across
as
an
imperial
stout
and
less
as
an
iipa
although
the
body
is
thinner
than
an
i
s
doverall
i
was
exspecting
more
from
this
after
reading
all
the
good
reviews
and
having
a
nice
local
black
ipa
the
day
before
this
one
was
very
drinkable
but
not
much
flavor
really
kinda
bland
and
just
ok
will
not
search
out
again
fitting
name
for
this
black
oily
stickysmelling
hemp
seedinfused
black
aleor
as
they
call
it
an
imperial
black
ipa
by
far
one
of
the
most
epic
heads
the
black
color
of
this
brew
is
inviting
too
thick
resin
of
citric
hop
and
hemp
in
the
nose
a
bit
piney
with
mild
chicory
and
cocoa
powder
from
the
malt
and
ripe
fruit
from
the
alcohol
pungent
hop
smack
tackles
the
palate
hard
sticky
resin
with
evergreen
and
mixed
citric
flavors
malt
sweetness
and
the
blackness
behind
it
break
through
just
enough
to
keep
the
beer
in
balance
alcohol
is
a
bit
amped
up
but
not
hot
hop
and
hemp
flavors
stay
for
a
while
during
a
semiroasted
bittersweet
finish
wow
a
lot
to
take
in
but
in
the
end
this
ale
works
as
all
flavors
meld
well
together
a
good
beer
which
brings
an
interesting
flavor
to
the
table
maybe
a
bit
less
roast
and
the
hops
would
shine
through
a
bit
nicer
smooth
soft
subtle
and
tasty
with
the
9
2
way
in
the
back
ground
creamy
chocolate
all
through
this
one
drying
herbal
and
again
earthy
hops
in
the
rear
to
add
the
balance
bite
and
intrigue
quality
darkblack
dipa
well
worth
giving
this
one
a
try
serving
type
bottle
o
until
now
i
was
not
really
sold
on
the
black
ipa
trend
we
seem
to
be
seeing
in
many
american
craft
brewers
i
am
very
happy
with
this
beer
overall
definitely
worth
the
try
especially
if
you
like
the
style
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
black
ipa
the
appearance
is
great
but
thats
pretty
much
it
everything
else
is
fairly
standard
this
needs
more
of
that
chocolate
roasty
malt
quality
that
one
expected
with
a
black
ipa
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
a
near
jet
black
except
for
some
ruby
tinge
when
held
in
some
lighta
blooming
light
mocha
colored
head
atop
big
roast
in
the
nose
along
with
some
raw
earthinessthe
piney
hops
are
there
but
a
little
subdued
the
hops
are
much
bigger
on
the
palateresiny
and
citrusy
along
with
dark
bread
and
coffee
roast
a
real
good
black
ale
but
the
alcohol
sweetness
does
creep
a
little
so
its
not
something
i
could
drink
alot
of
overall
its
not
bad
but
not
great
im
not
sure
what
the
hemp
seed
did
for
this
beer
but
it
didnt
make
this
beer
become
overly
unique
id
drink
it
again
but
there
are
many
others
id
choose
before
this
one
ive
been
waiting
for
a
beer
like
this
good
interpretation
of
style
made
me
want
a
zoe
pours
a
dark
orangeybrown
but
sits
nearly
black
in
the
glass
tan
head
takes
a
while
to
develop
through
the
thick
liquid
but
it
puffs
up
to
a
solid
three
fingers
before
melting
away
to
leave
thick
finebubbled
lacing
first
impression
is
that
this
smells
like
a
hoppy
barleywine
lots
of
grapefruity
hops
and
a
toasty
caramel
maltiness
as
it
warms
more
chocolate
comes
through
but
this
is
a
hoppy
beast
even
at
three
months
old
flavor
has
some
smooth
darkbutnotsuperdark
chocolate
and
pineapple
hops
to
go
with
a
very
bitter
finish
ashy
tobacco
notes
recall
cheap
cigars
and
theres
a
big
fusel
presence
the
label
says
the
malts
align
with
the
hops
but
i
find
the
flavor
profile
to
be
discordant
palate
is
nice
and
silky
while
the
beer
is
cool
but
some
warmth
thins
it
out
and
shows
more
alcohol
couldnt
finish
the
12
oz
bottle
overall
fantastic
showing
i
will
definitely
pick
up
more
of
this
i
hope
this
becomes
a
regular
offering
at
my
local
packy
i
could
definitely
put
this
in
the
regular
rotation
overall
this
is
a
really
complex
beer
and
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
cda
style
the
flavor
goes
on
and
on
i
can
only
recommend
this
for
the
adventurous
sort
as
the
flavors
are
really
intense
those
that
can
handle
it
will
be
rewarded
i
also
suggest
trying
it
fresh
od
a
good
imperial
black
ipa
that
seems
to
be
able
to
strongly
deliver
both
the
interesting
malts
of
a
black
ipa
as
well
as
the
potent
hopping
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
in
terms
of
style
but
it
is
a
well
crafted
delicious
ale
in
any
case
finally
rating
this
a
new
black
iipa
from
uinta
brewed
with
hemp
seeds
named
after
the
utah
state
star
no
association
with
doobies
im
sure
pours
a
pure
black
color
with
a
medium
beige
head
the
aroma
is
massive
floral
and
pine
hops
really
dank
the
flavor
is
a
very
hoppy
brew
high
bitterness
a
massive
peppery
spiciness
could
this
be
in
part
the
hemp
seed
a
rich
roast
and
chocolate
very
damn
good
aggressive
certainly
a
huge
beer
lots
to
like
here
overall
its
just
not
pleasant
its
almost
all
charred
bitterness
that
just
sits
in
your
mouth
overall
im
complacent
with
the
four
pack
that
i
picked
up
i
cant
say
that
im
going
to
get
many
more
bottles
of
this
the
price
is
pretty
damned
great
though
1
80something
per
bottle
i
like
black
ipas
plenty
im
just
not
fully
into
this
one
o
perhaps
the
best
bdipabipa
i
have
ever
enjoyed
i
bought
a
single
bottle
of
it
for
like
2
19
making
a
6er
probably
about
12
a
good
deal
hell
with
all
of
you
over
analyzing
beer
yuppies
this
actions
is
the
goods
its
like
an
imperial
stout
got
together
with
a
double
ipa
did
meth
and
went
on
a
10
hr
love
making
marathon
balanced
yet
aggressive
with
equally
distinct
flavors
amazing
as
it
warms
sweet
yet
hoppy
not
overly
muted
taste
the
goods
orale
o
i
seem
to
like
the
double
black
ipa
style
than
the
regular
black
ipas
at
this
alcohol
level
the
flavours
get
much
more
integrated
theres
better
structure
and
balance
really
its
comparable
to
very
hoppy
stouts
uintas
done
a
good
job
here
check
it
out
p
s
i
did
grab
a
four
pack
and
i
dont
regret
it
all
pours
jet
black
with
a
almost
no
head
retention
light
cream
color
on
the
little
lacing
that
is
there
aroma
is
mild
but
does
have
some
hint
of
roasty
malts
and
some
hops
the
flavor
blends
the
roasty
malts
well
with
the
dry
hoppy
bitterness
decent
finish
to
the
beer
some
what
residual
bitterness
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
picked
up
a
four
pack
of
this
one
this
afternoon
kind
of
on
a
black
ale
kick
for
some
reason
poured
a
nice
rich
dark
brown
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
and
a
big
light
brown
head
aromas
of
dark
chocolate
earthy
hops
and
light
coffee
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
milk
and
dark
chocolate
vanilla
and
earthy
hops
with
a
lingering
bitter
finish
eta
tried
it
again
less
goldfishtanky
but
a
really
onedimensional
grain
bill
and
well
i
dont
know
at
least
when
it
tasted
like
a
fish
tank
it
had
some
personality
onot
that
great
i
like
the
concept
but
its
not
well
executed
do
note
to
self
you
still
need
to
review
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
every
black
ipa
seems
to
tie
back
into
that
seminal
anniversary
beer
from
stone
in
some
way
and
such
is
doubly
true
for
those
that
stray
over
the
7
mark
this
beer
from
uinta
newly
arrived
in
the
southern
california
market
is
no
exception
falling
very
close
to
the
stylistic
origin
dubh
does
not
attempt
to
pull
any
punches
it
is
in
the
face
of
the
drinker
from
start
to
finish
taunting
the
palate
with
dark
grain
american
hops
and
astringency
served
in
aggressive
and
palatechoking
abundance
it
is
beautiful
in
its
intensity
but
hard
to
finishwearing
out
the
palate
about
halfway
through
the
serving
the
brewer
is
kind
not
to
package
this
in
a
largerformat
bottle
twelve
ounces
is
plenty
of
food
for
thought
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
aftertaste
perhaps
its
the
marketing
brewed
with
hemp
seed
and
a
name
pronounced
doobie
but
the
aftertaste
is
distinctly
similar
to
well
you
get
the
idea
good
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
if
you
are
looking
for
a
black
ipa
cheers
mates
this
beer
has
what
i
enjoy
in
a
black
ipa
crispness
slightly
smoky
but
easy
to
drink
without
being
overpowered
with
any
of
the
malts
or
hops
so
thin
no
foreward
taste
of
much
it
all
kinda
blends
i
do
like
the
carbonation
of
it
though
its
kinda
like
sri
lanka
not
as
latent
as
a
stout
or
porter
still
stays
in
touch
with
india

but
balanced
by
firm
rich
dark

flavors

nothing

certainly
worth
your
beertime
on
a
bottle
or
two
o
glad
to
have
tried
this
one
and
would
buy
it
again
but
unlikely
to
become
one
of
my
go
to
beers
the
dark
roasted
malts
created
a
taste
that
was
a
bit
burnt
and
made
the
beer
a
little
too
bitter
but
definitely
a
solid
beer
otherwise

i
was

a

enjoyable
offering
oalthough
still
within
the
best
by
date
it
was
too
malty
maybe
fresh
the
beer
would
better
then
again
it
could
just
be
too
malty
my
pour
went
off
without
a
hitch
and
the
resulting
pseudocascade
was
a
pleasure
to
watch
it
settled
into
a
finger
of
dense
lighttanmochacolored
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
srm
44
and
i
have
to
ask
if
anyone
really
registers
any
beer
as
black
although
it
was
dense
enough
to
prevent
any
light
penetration
in
the
glass
i
could
see
what
it
looked
like
during
the
pour
nose
had
the
dark
deeproasted
burntsmoky
scent
that
i
dislike
in
this
style
i
got
a
faint
grassy
mintiness
from
the
hops
but
the
malts
were
getting
in
the
way
bah
let
nothing
stand
between
a
hophead
and
tasting
hisher
hops
mouthfeel
was
dense
thick
especially
for
an
ipa
of
any
stripe
nice
the
taste
however
was
a
different
story
or
better
put
it
was
more
of
the
same
man
i
just
cannot
get
past
the
roasty
malt
characteristic
that
defines
this
style
i
kept
tasting
charcoal
and
not
in
what
i
would
define
as
a
pleasant
way
finish
was
dry
smoky
almost
stoutlike
but
where
were
the
hops
i
weep
for
the
hops
that
go
into
these
recipes
as
they
have
given
their
all
for
naught
nice
lacing
by
the
way
next
o
pretty
good
just
wish
i
had
gotten
to
it
when
it
was
fresher
even
so
i
feel
like
even
at
its
freshest
it
still
wouldnt
be
a
match
for
durty
i
dont
think
smutty
makes
a
bad
beer
ive
been
brewing
for
over
15
years
and
i
struggle
to
produce
a
beer
like
this
nice
hop
character
great
lasting
dark
cholocate
malt
flavor
this
is
top
notch
stuff
and
at
5
7
abv
you
can
have
a
couple
and
enjoy
them
without
walking
head
first
into
the
tv
getting
up
to
take
a
leak
at
halftimeend
of
quarterend
of
peroid
if
you
like
flavor
and
well
crafted
beer
grab
some
of
this
and
enjoy
o
when
this
style
first
began
hitting
the
shelves
i
loved
it
but
as
more
and
more
examples
of
the
style
came
out
i
found
myself
shying
away
from
them
because
they
usually
were
underwhelming
this
one
is
an
exception
the
big
hop
characters
with
only
subtle
dark
flavors
is
imo
how
the
style
should
be
done
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
every
enjoyed
must
try
esp
if
you
like
em
dry
o
quite
bitter
overall
with
little
malt
sweetness
focus
is
on
heavily
roasted
malt
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
american
black
ale
it
is
not
the
most
refined
example
of
the
style
in
the
world
but
it
is
still
unique
and
very
much
worthwhile
fresh
tasting
and
well
crafted
tribute
to
a
true
vermont
craft
beer
pioneer
pours
a
big
frothy
brown
head
close
to
three
fingers
as
it
crests
fullon
mix
of
bubble
sizes
from
huge
to
tiny
dimpled
all
over
the
lacing
is
thin
but
forms
broad
sheets
which
cover
close
to
half
the
available
glass
space
black
liquid
yet
has
a
shiny
brightness
to
it
this
in
spite
of
the
chunky
floaties
inside
the
glass
hard
to
visually
gauge
the
carbonation
shifts
to
a
yellow
hue
along
the
rims
the
nose
is
sweetly
roasty
oodles
of
chocolate
coffee
hard
toffee
with
even
more
malt
after
that
its
hoppy
in
a
mellow
fashion
more
cleansing
than
herbaceous
subtle
floral
lift
not
much
fruit
but
maybe
a
little
earthiness
fullbodied
thicker
and
denser
than
expected
the
carbonation
is
slow
to
unwind
but
it
does
not
feel
flatfooted
here
too
theres
a
strong
emphasis
on
roast
although
it
does
adroitly
avoid
bitterness
coffee
beans
cocoa
mocha
more
than
milkiness
although
theres
moments
of
root
beer
and
vanilla
mutter
of
quinine
the
mouth
feel
is
grippy
and
dry
more
pine
and
cut
grass
than
flowers
or
citrus
again
hard
to
discern
clear
fruit
presence
more
apricot
maybe
cherry
because
it
starts
with
such
intent
and
energy
its
hard
for
it
not
to
finish
likewise
sticks
to
the
basics
does
them
well
enough
o
rather
than
punching
me
in
the
face
with
hop
bitterness
the
ipa
portion
of
this
beer
integrates
so
well
with
the
roasted
malts
it
makes
me
wonder
if
im
really
drinking
a
glass
of
cold
espresso
id
love
to
see
this
tribute
become
a
yearround
offering
brewed
in
tribute
to
a
late
brewer
and
it
cherishes
his
memory
right
on
tap
at
ny
pizza
pours
black
with
an
inch
of
khaki
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
hints
of
chocolate
the
taste
is
chocolate
and
coffee
with
roasted
malts
less
of
a
hop
presence
than
i
expected
from
the
nose
still
there
are
some
piney
hop
notes
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
at
the
finish
charcoal
as
well
lots
of
carbonation
overall
solid
black
ipa
but
maybe
a
bit
too
roasty
mouthfeel
a
little
thin
feeling
decent
carbonation
but
due
to
the
roasty
character
of
the
beer
a
little
more
smoothness
would
be
a
nice
improvement
taste
is
definitely
bitter
and
roast
up
front
with
the
bittersweet
cocoa
notes
coming
in
around
an
astringent
acidic
hops
character
solid
and
enjoyable
though
not
a
favorite
pours
out
thick
heavy
and
beastly
yes
a
beast
of
a
beer
many
qualities
of
a
good
stout
as
far
as
black
ipas
are
concerned
this
is
way
heavier
and
stronger
aftertaste
of
bourbon
heavy
malt
taste
leaves
the
palate
slightly
dry
nice
glass
lacing
the
noonan
is
a
complex
brew
that
gets
better
and
takes
over
with
every
sip
i
cant
find
any
foods
to
pair
it
with
yet
because
this
beer
is
almost
like
a
meal
in
itself
overall
its
alright
in
the
realm
but
theres
some
better
out
there
no
worries
this
drinks
easily
a
solid
example
of
a
black
ipa
although
in
my
opinion
way
too
close
to
a
stout
with
its
roast
honestly
i
would
consider
this
beer
basically
a
stout
with
a
light
body
while
the
hop
character
is
present
it
doesnt
take
the
main
stage
as
an
ipa
should
it
is
a
good
data
point
for
this
emerging
style
o
this
is
the
best
blend
of
styles
ive
had
in
a
long
time
and
thats
because
you
can
taste
the
transformation
from
porter
to
ipa
experiencing
that
evolution
on
your
palate
is
really
interesting
its
something
you
dont
come
across
with
every
hoppy
black
ale
you
try
or
sometimes
its
there
but
it
just
doesnt
work
here
though
the
transition
to
a
brisk
hoppy
pale
is
so
stark
and
refreshing
that
you
cant
help
but
enjoy
it
grab
a
sixpack
if
you
can
because
one
wont
be
enough
this
is
a
rare
black
ale
that
accentuates
roastiness
over
hoppiness
it
is
more
closely
related
to
a
classic
baltic
porter
than
an
american
black
ipa
i
liked
this
beer
more
and
more
the
further
down
the
glass
i
got
an
excellent
but
definitely
different
kind
of
black
ale
in
general
the
beer
is
roasty
porter
with
heavy
bitterness
it
does
not
exactly
hit
where
i
want
black
ipa
although
i
prefer
a
bit
more
citrusy
ipa
than
roasted
malt
quality
however
it
still
packs
tons
of
flavor
for
5

abv
o
dunno
who
the
noonan
guy
is
on
the
label
and
in
the
title
but
whatever
he
has
to
do
with
this
brew
he
did
ok
this
might
qualify
as
a
baltic
or
american
porter
and
a
pretty
good
one
overall
a
very
solid
brew
great
roasty

taste
is

light

a
touch
of
smokiness
mild
and
easy
drinking
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
less
hoppy
than
i
would
have
liked
for
this
style

great

job
smuttynose
whereas
the
nose
was
more
on

malty
side
the
flavor
really
kicks
off
with
hoppiness
there
is
some
semisweet
choco
here
plus
some
very
roasty
almost
burnt
malt
hitting
the
palate
but
that
is
quickly
overwhelmed
by
a
pronounced
florality
with
some
earthy
notes
mixed
in
as
well
it
is
almost
rindy
and
that
aspect
lingers
long
in
the
aftertaste
overall
it
is
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
a
fitting
tribute
to
an
esteemed

i
went
back
to
this
several
times
that
night
this
is
a
great
brew
it
should
be
a
full
time
beer
the
biggest
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
name
as
greg
noonan
is
often
credited
for
inventing
this
style
a
black
ipa
named
after
him
should
be
very
exceptional
this
is
good
but
i
wouldnt
call
it
exceptional
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
nice
beer
if
you
are
looking
for
lots
of
bitterness
without
the
accompanying
hop
flavors
its
quite
drinkable
overall
very
basic
black
ipa
with
citrus
pine
and
roast
and
caramel
which
imo
dont
blend
well
nothing
special
very
two
poled
beer
and
dont
combine

its
well

emphasizing

still
citrus

not
the
best
black

i
have
hadowing
to
some

still
well
crafted
and
worth
trying
dry
finish
solid
black
ipa
with
a
good
orange
peel
and
dark
grain
flavor
overall
a
great
black
ale
with
some
serious
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
o
smuttynose
usually
flies
under
the
radar
but
this
is
a
stellar
black
ipa
and
needs
more
credit
it
is
seriously
aggressively
like
a
good
ipa
but
definitely
complex
and
not
too
overwhelming
definitely
worth
having
again
a
full
flavored
brew
with
great
balance
and
taste
i
bought
a
single
but
id
like
to
get
more
sometime
this
week
good
stuff
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
one
clashes
the
roast
of
a
stout
or
porter
with
the
bitterness
of
their
finest
kind
ipa
a
fairly
great
black
ipa
overall
pours
black
with
an
impressively
thick
head
that
very
slowly
recedes
to
a
sustained
milky
covering
initial
dark
chocolate
and
piney
hop
aromas
becoming
more
grapefruity
as
it
warms
a
whiff
of
fresh
dark
malt
roasted
malt
flavor
met
with
a
wall
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
malt
flavor
is
bittersweet
and
charred
and
the
hops
are
hard
to
categorize
because
they
blend
so
well
with
the
roast
its
leafy
spicy
and
piney
and
comes
across
a
little
aggressive
overall
but
ill
allow
it
smooth
creamy
body
and
fairly
astringent
solid
all
around
if
not
particularly
memorable
overall
very
decent
for
the
style
drinkable
and
not
over
done
o
aroma
lacks
ipa
hoppiness
but
the
taste
is
true
to
style
a
little
too
roasty
for
my
liking
burnt
is
not
a
flavor
i
enjoy
would
benefit
from
more
base
malt
less
roast
and
more
hop
character
roasted
malt
and
coffee
bitterness
up
front
piny
hop
notes
increase
along
with
mineral
water
bitterness
light
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
fill
in
hop
and
roasted
malt
bitterness
take
over
the
finish
hints
of
earthy
tobacco
and
licorice
lingering
piny
herbal
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
chocolate
malt
medium
body
with
a
dry
feel
a
very
nice
black
ipa
a
very
solid
black
ipa
with
mild
hop
flavors
and
more
roasty
malt
flavors
like
a
stout
yet
the
dryness
is
there
which
id
prefer
to
be
balanced
by
more
sweetness
if
theres
one
weakness
its
that
this
is
just
a
little
thin
in
feel
and
taste
but
not
so
much
that
it
feels
watery
or
bland
would
i
like
a
little
more
body
and
spiciness
or
chocolatecoffee
yes
but
this
is
satisfying
anyway
i
could
easily
drink
again
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
feel
each
sip
is
delightfully
slurpable
with
appropriate
body
soft
creaminess
and
nice
fizziness
the
coloring
is
also
robust
for
the
style
and
the
aroma
gives
a
good
deal
of
complexity
through
its
fusel
qualities
the
flavoring
remains
uniform
throughout
keeping
things
smooth
predictable
and
flowing
while
some
may
see
this
as
a
bad
thing
it
actually
remained
easy
going
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
serious
take
stylistically
and
certainly
in
line
with
some
of
smuttynoses
top
beers
as
a
fan
of
gregs
writings
i
get
the
sense
that
this
is
a
forwardthinking
ale
that
which
he
would
have
found
great
comfort
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
array
of
scents
ranging
from
bitter
black
malts
roasted
malts
and
citrus
hops
its
bone
dry
and
inviting
with
lots
of
complexity
the
taste
is
good
as
well
its
extremely
balanced
with
excellent
malt
character
and
hop
flavor
its
goes
down
silky
smooth
and
finishes
dry
with
a
roastedblack
malt
feel
the
hop
character
add
a
mild
citrus
flare
and
adds
a
mild
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
thats
interesting
and
delicious
overall
pretty
solid
bipa
i
could
definitely
have
another
starts
off
watery
but
this
quickly
yields
to
some
strong
burnt
malt
the
aftertaste
is
a
lens
of
hop
and
malt
bitterness
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
high
but
it
doesnt
detract
from
the
strong
finishing
flavors
o
a
pretty
simple
black
ipa
really
nice
bitterness
but
flavors
are
fairly
soft
muted
and
simple
pretty
much
expected
given
the
abv
not
bad
though
i
enjoyed
it
on
the
bitter
end
of
a
black
ipa
for
sure
not
much
roasted
malt
here
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
chestnut
highlighted
browntoblack
coloring
with
a
frothy
filmy
clingy
light
tan
head
that
starts
a
solid
inch
but
settles
quickly
into
a
lingering
surface
coating
solid
cling
all
over
the
glass
as
you
drink
aromas
of
dark
roast
coffee
on
a
subtle
backbone
with
a
heavy
dose
of
floral
and
fruity
hops
grapefruit
and
mango
blend
for
the
fruity
highlight
with
a
resiny
ribbon
throughout
flavors
are
very
bitter
and
in
your
face
initially
hop
heads
rejoice
resiny
and
sharp
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
bitter
blast
that
dries
and
slightly
puckers
the
heavy
roast
and
coffee
characteristics
creep
in
on
the
backside
of
the
palate
but
the
middle
of
the
tongue
is
locked
in
to
the
resiny
fresh
hops
characteristics
completely
the
coffee
roast
flows
into
the
aftertaste
bringing
a
bit
more
balance
than
the
palate
had
during
the
initial
tasting
floral
highlights
dance
throughout
giving
a
lightness
to
the
heavy
bitterness
your
mouth
is
getting
hit
with
dry
bitter
finish
that
lingers
for
a
second
and
then
completely
vanishes
leaving
the
palate
clean
and
clear
for
another
flurry
of
punches
from
this
robust
beer
a
bit
unbalanced
but
a
tasty
brew
definitely
not
for
those
unlearned
in
the
ways
of
the
hops
but
as
i
said
before
hop
heads
rejoice
this
one
certainly
is
nice
brew
and
while
it
may
more
closely
resemble
a
porter
than
a
black
ipa
it
is
just
as
advertised
and
when
keeping
in
mind
what
this
recipe
was
when
originally
brewed
this
beer
is
delicious
it
has
a
thick
malty
mouth
that
is
pulled
away
from
an
elusive
sweet
caramel
into
burnt
bitterness
it
is
very
crisp
and
refreshing
and
has
some
good
complexities
in
the
interplay
of
sweet
and
bitter
but
bitter
definitely
dominates
almost
to
a
fault
there
is
some
nice
bitter
citrus
and
pine
but
the
burnt
malt
bitterness
overshadows
the
rest
a
very
good
beer
nonetheless
o
a
solid
black
ipa
with
a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
balanced
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
choice
for
their
new
spring
seasonal
overall
a
very
solid
offering
in
a
style
that
varies
greatly
from
beer
to
beer
o
either
an
aggressively
hopped
black
ale
or
an
overly
roasted
black
ipa
neither
of
which
suit
my
tastes
too
well
but
this
is
a
good
beer
nonetheless
o
i
dont
understand
kids
today
and
i
still
think
these
black
ipa
are
just
a
well
hopped
unbalanced
robust
porter
that
being
said
i
like
the
blend
of
citrus
and
chocolatecoffee
malt
with
the
agressive
hops
bitterness
going
on
here
the
hops
get
just
a
tad
harsh
on
the
finish
which
could
be
reduced
by
the
use
of
higher
alpha
hops
not
that
im
complaining
12oz
bottle
pours
black
with
a
rich
and
creamy

robust
sticky
lace
soaps
the
sides
of
the
glass
this
smells
of
a
rich
blend
of
chocolate
caramel
coffee
and
ripe
citrus
a
floral
and
lightly
spicy
feel
hangs
on
the
edges
of
the
nose
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
robust
yet
smooth
mix
of
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
a
firm
leafy
and
spicy
green
bitterness
and
coffee
flavor
throughout
that
leaves
this
burnt
and
roasted
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
medium
with
soft
creaminess
that
spreads
out
and
prickles
the
tongue
a
bit
nice
smooth
feel
here
to
this
this
was
a
really
nice
take
on
a
black
ipa
with
a
well
balanced
mix
of
flavors
and
a
super
drinkable
body
a
well
done
tribute
beer
for
sure
an
interesting
tribute
to
greg
noonan
that
if
im
correct
mimics
vt
pubs
own
blackwatch
ipa
which
is
said
to
be
the
or
one
of
depending
on
who
you
ask
prototype
for
the
american
black
ale
style
the
beer
pours
black
more
of
a
dull
dark
brown
held
to
the
light
with
12
an
inch
of
a
creamy
looking
tan
head
that
fades
quickly
while
lacing
the
nose
is
that
mocha
milk
stoutish
upfront
followed
by
some
subtle
hops
hops
which
are
present
only
after
sniffing
this
brew
harder
than
youd
have
to
sniff
glue
sticks
just
to
get
a
decent
buzz
going
more
citrusyfloral
hop
profile
which
isnt
my
favorite
mix
for
the
style
word
of
advice
let
this
guy
warm
a
tad
before
drinking
the
taste
brings
that
neglected
bitterness
to
the
center
stage
bumpin
disco
on
my
taste
buds
and
just
as
that
glue
buzz
is
fading
the
big
carobchocolate
malt
base
is
there
to
catch
you
this
beer
works
its
cascadey
bitterness
hard
on
my
unsuspecting
palate
front
to
back
working
for
dollars
but
lacks
the
generally
expected
roasttoastcaramel
sweetness
component
it
still
drinks
smooth
and
all
harshness
is
derived
from
the
hops
good
black
ipa
distinct
in
its
ability
to
slap
your
mouth
in
its
face
with
hops
no
apologies
but
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
backbone
o
tasty
very
flavorful
kinda
like
a
super
robust
porter
high
bitterness
especially
for
abv
worthy
purchase
and
up
to
the
smuttynose
standard
glad
i
bought
it
but
in
the
future
i
would
probably
tick
something
else
odpretty
solid
minus
the
nose
i
may
need
to
come
back
to
this
one
to
makes
sure
my
review
is
applicable
o
a
fitting
tribute
to
the
man
who
may
very
well
have
invented
the
style
as
we
know
it
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
roasted
malts
a
doublewhammy
of
bitterness
offered
by
each
as
well
an
even
more
enticing
buy
at
the
affordable
six
pack
price
d
a
really
solid
example
of
the
style
very
balanced
and
fullflavored
nicely
done
i
think
mr
noonan
would
be
proud
overall
this
is
a
beautiful
and
enticing
brew
whose
presentation
belies
its
aggressive
bitter
taste
if
youre
into
that
sorta
thing
you
may
well
enjoy
this
but
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
balanced
and
im
drinking
the
ashes
taste
lingers
in
mouth
for
long
time
mine
had
a
date
of
21714
almost
year
old
i
poured
out
it
was
so
bad
overall
quite
a
decent
beer
the
main
think
i
love
is
the
pitch
black
appearance
the
main
thing
i
would
change
would
be
to
balance
out
the
smokiness
and
the
sweet
malts
a
bit
more
dark
full
body
with
a
thin
tan
head
intense
cocoa
and
slightly
smoked
malts
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
lots
to
like
here
not
the
greatest
in
my
opinion
just
an
average
dark
beer
i
like
the
hops
which
this
one
is
missing
very
dark
and
bitter
just
what
i
like
dark
horse
says
this
has
a
hard
time
being
called
a
porter
or
stout
and
i
agree
im
sure
this
is
spoton
for
the
emerging
black
ale
category
as
it
is
truly
black
looks
pretty
damn
good
imperial
stoutlike
with
a
thin
brown
head
but
smells
more
like
an
ipa
i
hoped
for
a
more
rounded
malt
and
roast
in
the
flavor
profile
but
mostly
i
just
get
west
coast
hops
not
my
cup
of
brew
the
feel
is
quite
full
but
it
still
keeps
an
easy
drinking
presence
very
enjoyable
yet
nicely
complex
o
a
rock
solid
and
very
approachable
black
ale
i
have
no
complaints
with
this
one

why
this
is
an

it
tastes
like
a
damn
fine
stout
to
me
that

and
it

a

beer
that

this

has
a

i
just
cant
get
by
the
sourness
of
this
beer
after
the
swallow
it
would
seem
to
fit
better
with
a
milk
stout
i
would
drink
another
one
and
a
hearty
flavor
then
it
finishes
with
with
an
even

it

this
is
my
second
tonight
and
i
could
do
another
with
a

of
foam
affixed
to
the
surface
for
being
the
abv
and
style
that
it
is
i
was
surprised
it
didnt
pour
as
thick
as
initially
expected
nevertheless
it
was
still
nice
the
smell
was
of

damian
interesting
style
inbetween
a
porter
and
a
stout
i
chose
this
first
this
evening
since
i
was
saving
stouts
for
later
so
it
threw
me
for
a
bit
of
a
loop
i
shouldnt
blame
the
beer
for
that
slow
one
to
enjoy
and
it
just
bugs
me
that
this
is
listed
as
a
strong
this
is
a
pretty
good
dry
stout
not
loving
it
as
a
strong
ale
the
way
i
think
of
them
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
that
hides
the
abv
well
it
tastes
like
a
slightly
more
complex
schwarzbier
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
to
sip
but
am
not
likely
to
go
out
of
my
way
and
order
this
would
i
buy
more
of
it
yes
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
for
sure
no
doubt
about
it
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
the
most
underrated
beers
on
the
shelfs
of
indiana
beer
stores
pours
black
as
black
i
would
say
it
resembles
that
of
an
american
porter
lots
of
coffee
dry
bitter
finish
with
a
medium
hop
profile
this
is
a
very
chewy
complex
beer
its
very
rich
with
deep
notes
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
velvety
texture
great
beer
dry
and
extremely
bitter
from
black
patent
malt
more
burnt
than
most
dry
stouts
the
aftertaste
is
of
coffee
grounds
the
taste
is
chewy
but
the
body
is
thin
for
the
style
the
potency
is
hidden
by
the
strength
of
the
bitter
dark
malt
overall
quite
delicious
overall
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
sort
of
a
pocket
imperial
stout
trimmed
down
a
bit
the
taste
is
heavy
on
the
roasted
and
black
malts
with
a
choclatey
sweetness
underneath
it
all
at
over
7
there
isnt
really
any
burn
but
it
definitely
smacks
of
charcoal
on
the
finish
its
pleasant
for
a
while
but
the
acrid
bitterness
on
the
finish
gets
pretty
old
american
strong
ale
id
guess
more
like
a
porter
pours
a
viscous
black
motor
oil
with
a
khakicinnamon
colored
one
finger
head
it
looks
like
its
going
to
stain
my
glass
awesome
smells
robust
dark
chocolate
coffee
dark
fruits
candied
sugars
rich
and
complex
tastes
chocolatey
and
velvety
bold
flavor
that
is
creamy
and
smooth
lingering
bitters
this
beer
is
just
excellent
highly
recommend
im
definitely
confused
with
the
style
however
this
beer
is
clearly
more
like
a
dry
stout
kind
of
like
obsidian
stout
by
deschutes
but
with
more
of
a
kick
the
beer
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
bitter
black
malt
scent
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
it
has
a
tremendous
roasted
malt
character
with
some
mild
chocolate
malt
notes
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
bone
dry
black
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
tons
of
earthy
coffeelike
character
there
is
a
bit
of
chocolate
malt
sweetness
which
does
add
some
balance
but
for
the
most
part
its
all
black
patent
and
roasted
barley
goodness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
black
ale
i
would
love
to
see
this
fermented
with
lager
yeast
but
ill
take
this
version
any
day
i
would
definitely
call
this
beer
a
russian
imperial
stout
not
anywhere
like
a
strong
ale
not
sure
who
gave
it
that
label
its
a
pretty
nice
beer
too
lots
of
roast
chocolate
creamy
but
just
way
too
bitter
and
dry
this
beer
is
a
full
bodied
affair
very
thick
and
syrupy
and
creamy
the
beer
has
a
very
charred
almost
burnt
molasses
and
dark
malt
flavor
there
is
some
sweeter
malts
hidden
deep
underneath
but
the
charred
roasted
dark
malts
pretty
much
predominate
there
is
a
slight
abv
quality
to
the
beer
and
there
is
some
leafy
hop
in
there
on
the
back
end
the
aftertaste
is
very
burnt
wood
taste
on
the
tongue
i
particularly
like
the
sweetish
almost
cherry
chocolate
flavors
in
the
mid
section
of
the
beer
but
they
are
way
down
below
the
molasses
and
charred
flavors
coupled
with
the
leafy
hop
makes
this
a
beer
that
is
assertive
its
a
decent
beer
for
the
right
occasion
the
aftertaste
is
probably
the
low
point
o
a
refreshing
take
on
the
imperial
stout
by
dark
horse
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
near
black
minimal
head
and
lacing
on
this
one
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malts
hints
of
chocolate
coffee
tar
whiffs
of
grassy
hops
very
stoutlike
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
and
sometimes
burnt
grains
beans
coffee
cocoa
nuts
background
holds
some
molasses
like
sweetness
dark
fruits
and
a
grassy
hop
prsence
acidic
and
bitter
at
times
lacks
in
carbonation
dry
and
chalky
finnish
interesting
beer
that
is
halfway
between
a
stout
and
schwarz
strong
roasted
grain
profile
but
bitter
lowly
carbonated
and
dry
finnish
dont
compliment
the
overall
beer
as
well
as
it
could
have
drinkability
very
nice
both
very
complex
and
easy
to
drink
ba
and
dark
horse
both
claim
this
is
not
a
stout
but
surely
it
is
a
stout
of
some
kind
it
seems
like
a
rampedup
bitter
and
higher
alcohol
cream
stout
with
a
strange
dash
of
holiday
spirit
overall
a
decent
offering
from
dark
horse
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
the
taste
was
quite
nice
and
it
went
down
pretty
quickly
and
with
a
thicker
more
robust
mouthfeel
this
beer
might
actually
turn
some
heads
at
the
moment
however
it
lacks
the
body
to
bring
the
flavor
over
the
hump
and
on
the
whole
doesnt
quite
live
up
to
its
potential
too
bad
really
this
is
one
ill
have
again
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
in
a
rush
d
very
enjoyable
beer
looks
smells
and
taste
great
perfect
for
a
nice
chilly
evening
im
just
not
sure
if
i
would
want
multiple
of
these
di
really
like
this
beer
very
tasty
and
awesome
mouthfeel
it
tastes
more
like
an
imperial
porter
but
is
just
great
this
one
crosses
the
line
between
porter
and
stout
a
hybrid
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
ranked
as
low
as
it
is
it
is
fantastic
bursting
with
flavor
many
roasted
notes
but
not
burnt
smooth
bitter
black
and
roasted
graham
cracker
chocolate
coffee
fudge
and
brown
sugar
all
fight
for
dominance
in
an
extremely
well
balanced
beer
the
best
ive
had
from
dark
horse
and
a
real
treat
creamy
silky
feel
very
mellow
despite
the
big
flavor
highly
recommended
drinkability
really
enjoyable
with
great
flavors
and
a
nice
earthy
warmth
to
it
im
not
really
sure
if
would
do
well
with
age
or
not
but
im
willing
to
give
it
a
shot
and
throw
a
few
in
the
back
of
the
closet
and
see
how
it
does
with
some
time
on
it
dont
drink
and
review
i
quite
enjoyed
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
easily
get
my
hands
on
more
mouthfeel
is
great
as
well
crisp
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
not
too
heavy
very
drinkable
one
of
my
favorites
from
a
great
brewery
beer
has
medium
body
and
finishes
with
a
strong
avalanche
of
roasted
malt
coffee
flavor
it
comes
up
so
late
that
one
might
consider
it
an
aftertaste
second
taste
roast
is
dominant
over
all
other
flavors
there
is
a
growing
bitterness
that
isnt
from
the
roast
though
perhaps
some
hops
trying
to
squeeze
through
yelling
taste
me
im
here
too
drinkability
is
fine
and
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
probably
not
a
repeat
for
me
i
do
recommend
it
for
people
to
try
if
they
have
the
opportunity
d
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
well
balanced
nice
flavoring
goes
down
easy
and
worthy
to
have
a
few
of
this
beer
pours
like
motor
oil
there
is
a
dark
brown
head
that
sticks
around
the
smell
is
of
faint
coffee
and
maybe
some
hersheys
special
dark
the
taste
is
quite
a
bit
lighter
than
the
aroma
but
very
similiar
i
have
to
say
this
stuff
is
more
of
an
imperial
stout
than
anything
it
is
nice
and
thick
and
well
balanced
perfect
for
a
cold
afternoon
the
finish
is
very
clean
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
tmf
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
bitter
dark
and
dry
chocolate
licorice
toasted
caramel
with
a
dry
leafy
hop
bitterness
interspersed
in
between
everything
pours
thick
curtain
of
black
the
beer
itself
actually
sticks
to
the
side
of
the
glass
like
oil
beautiful
orange
tan
head
heavy
lacing
smells
of
roasted
barley
molasses
brown
sugar
and
toffee
roasted
malts
exploding
on
the
taste
buds
great
mouthfeel
dry
and
slightly
sour
medium
low
hoppiness
creamy
smooth
and
delicious
inky
oily
black
tan
head
looks
a
bit
purple
it
rose
and
fell
leaving
a
wispy
ring
and
some
surface
spritz
smell
of
black
licorice
toasty
malt
tiramisu
taste
features
big
toasted
chocolate
and
coffee
malts
rich
velvety
mouthfeel
medium
body
a
bit
dense
there
is
a
coffee
bean
astringency
that
detracts
somewhat
from
the
overall
package
but
there
is
more
than
enough
substantial
flavour
to
carry
it
drinks
more
like
a
porter
or
a
stout
not
bad
at
all
holy
exxon
valdez
batman
this
looked
like
an
oil
spill
as
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
the
two
fingers
of
head
were
about
as
deep
brown
as
i
have
ever
seen
in
a
thick
foamy
head
i
have
had
coffee
that
was
less
dense
and
deep
black
than
this
beer
the
nose
was
redolent
with
chocolate
fudge
brownies
dark
chocolate
bars
wow
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
full
with
a
rich
chocolate
flavor
accompanied
by
light
smoke
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
rich
chocolaty
somewhat
more
charcoal
than
in
the
mouth
with
a
dusty
dry
finish
this
would
be
better
as
a
dessert
beer
imho
i
do
not
think
thinks
this
is
a
real
drinkable
beer
to
hoppy
for
the
style
the
finish
could
be
a
lot
less
bitter
the
hops
overpower
the
coffee
malt
forward
taste
i
believe
this
is
more
of
an
american
stout
than
a
stong
ale
overall
a
very
solid
offering
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
dark
horse
through
six
of
these
i
loved
it
at
times
and
didnt
at
others
good
for
what
it
is
but
too
burnt
and
over
the
top
for
me
about
average
for
the
style
overall
ive
been
impressed
with
dark
horse
brewing
the
darker
the
better
and
one
hell
of
a
kick
to
the
taste
buds
big
bold
complex
and
inyourface
no
need
to
debate
on
whether
it
is
a
stout
or
porter
or
even
a
double
of
the
style
its
good
drinking
enough
said
review
from
notes
taken
on
11209
an
ohoove
special
this
beauty
shows
a
dark
brown
black
with
a
fair
light
brown
head
and
decent
rings
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
bitter
coffee
and
nutty
seaweed
the
flavor
brings
a
tart
citrus
hopped
coffee
malt
its
light
to
midbodied
but
thick
in
taste
and
smooth
in
feel
quite
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
charcoal
becomes
much
more
evident
after
a
few
sips
and
i
even
pick
up
a
peach
hint
generally
tart
and
sharp
good
stuff
notes
i
really
believe
that
this
tasted
like
a
stout
i
did
not
have
access
to
the
internet
during
the
review
this
brew
pours
an
opaque
jet
black
with
great
lace
left
from
the
thick
dark
tan
head
the
aroma
is
highly
roasty
chocolate
and
moderate
caramel
sweetness
the
flavor
is
highly
roasty
with
moderatehigh
bitterness
with
a
bittersweet
finish
the
body
is
full
and
chewy
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
with
sharp
bitterness
enhanced
by
roasty
malts
worth
a
try
as
the
name
suggests
this
is
black
motor
oil
looking
with
a
mocha
head
not
much
retention
and
some
minimal
lacing
burnt
malt
aroma
very
stout
like
caramel
and
molasses
mild
chocolate
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
thick
and
smooth
body
mildly
syrup
like
adequate
carbonation
for
the
style
flavor
is
roasted
malt
and
barley
heavy
with
some
sweet
molasses
and
chocolate
flavors
in
the
finish
to
balance
out
the
burnt
notes
also
an
unexpected
light
hop
bite
in
the
finish
a
very
nice
big
but
drinkable
stout
pretty

lovers

love
this
one
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
nice
coffee
forward
strong
ale
edit
had
a
few
bottles
two
months
later
and
this
stuff
really
went
downhill
taste
wise
while
i
enjoyed
this
fresh
where
its
at
now
is
just
plain
wrong
it
reminded
me
of
stale
coffee
with
old
cream
and
some
smoke
with
old
licorice
i
gotta
dock
some
points
drinkability
very
good
its
a
little
strong
to
be
drinking
a
whole
bunch
but
certainly
will
be
kept
in
mind
d
would
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
really
nice
d
i
didnt
know
what
this
was
when
i
ordered
it
but
i
was
very
impressed
to
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
order
another
one
a
solid
beer
with
both
stout
and
porter
characteristics
all
in
all
a
very
nice
ale
otherwise
however
there
isnt
much
to
scoff
at
i
dont
know
why
this
is
considered
a
reserve
special
when
in
fact
i
would
consider
it
a
great
every
day
drinking
dark
beer
porter
or
stout
it
is
a
little
of
both
but
not
exactly
either
this
is
a
deliciously
quaffable
beer
that
would
likely
work
just
as
well
before
during
or
after
a
hearty
dinner
enjoyed
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
drinkable
d
fast
or
slow
this
should
satisfy
anyone
looking
for
a
decent
strong
ale
that
is
balanced
very
well
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
but
with
a
nice
light
creamy
carbonation
thats
fantastic
and
really
increases
the
drinkability
for
me
nary
a
hint
of
alcohol
very
nicely
done
according
to
the
bartender
this
is
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
a
stout
indeed
it
had
many
porter
like
characteristics
with
a
definitely
more
assertive
malt
profile
and
a
considerably
stronger
hop
note
it
was
a
black
bodied
beer
with
a
tan
head
that
left
incredible
lacing
that
head
lasted
forever
also
the
aroma
was
hoppy
the
taste
was
of
alcohol
followed
by
roastiness
and
then
malty
sweetness
then
finally
it
finishes
with
a
nice
bitter
roastiness
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
very
nice
sipping
beer
and
more
than
one
wouldnt
be
tough
d
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
listed
as
a
strong
ale
for
one
its
just
not
that
strong
really
more
reminiscent
of
a
porter
or
a
stout
i
will
admit
i
was
a
more
impressed
with
this
one
than
i
expected
to
be
but
the
tongue
biting
bitterness
can
be
a
little
tiring
still
light
enough
to
be
able
to
drink
easily
drinkability
overall
is
decent
nothing
i
will
be
draining
in
number
but
definitely
a
nice
complex
dark
ale
that
varies
from
the
usual
stoutporterschwarzbier
path
but
shares
characteristics
of
each
of
those
definitely
a
hybrid
not
sure
how
to
label
this
michigan
brewed
gem
d
i
think
an
aficionado
of
the
stout
style
not
imperial
stouts
but
the
regular
old
kind
would
get
a
lot
out
of
this
one
unfortunately
i
didnt
i
respect
the
craft
here
but
the
flavor
was
kind
of
offputting
and
unimpressive
d
fantastic
chocolateforward
beer
that
drinks
like
an
imperial
porter
or
even
a
stout
this
one
packs
a
nice
blast
of
coffee
flavor
and
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
too
hv
i
sampled
this
beer
the
other
day
at
a
tasting
and
now
i
get
an
entire
bottle
to
myself
poured
into
my
pint
glass
the
beer
is
dark
chocolate
brown
it
borders
on
black
a
tiny
wisp
of
head
sit
on
top
of
my
glass
i
take
a
huge
whiff
and
wow
this
smells
terrific
coffee
chocolate
caramel
vanilla
and
malt
its
a
perfect
storm
of
aromatics
for
me
they
all
seem
to
blend
together
so
effortlessly
no
one
aroma
takes
center
stage
i
love
it
the
flavor
is
a
touch
less
dramatic
coffee
is
the
main
player
with
chocolate
and
malt
taking
supporting
roles
vanilla
and
caramel
make
small
cameos
in
the
scene
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
not
to
heavy
full
body
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
um
i
dont
really
know
what
style
this
fits
in
i
just
know
its
a
really
good
beer
a
bit
of
a
different
animal
here
im
still
not
convinced
that
a
schwarzbier
proportion
isnt
at
work
here
just
at
the
scale
gravity
and
hopping
rates
of
an
american
stout
if
i
were
a
smoker
i
imagine
id
dig
this
beer
but
this
one
just
smoked
me
out
and
it
killed
the
drinkability
for
me
drinkability
is
very
nice
though
one
at
a
time
serves
its
purpose
very
well
poured
a
nice
oil
slick
dark
with
some
light
brown
head
the
dissipated
quickly
smelled
of
chocolate
and
coffee
and
tasked
it
also
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
overall
it
was
a
decent
brew
and
pretty
drinkable
id
say
it
was
a
fair
mix
between
a
stout
and
a
medium
ale
mouthfeeldrinkability
absolutely
sublime
texture
in
the
mouth
its
medium
bodied
with
a
richness
matched
by
the
beers
stunning
palate
powerfully
robust
its
an
easy
drinker
that
demands
respect
and
appreciation
the
bite
of
the
alcohol
and
richness
of
the
malts
make
this
a
sipper
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
has
a
nice
soft
bubble
feel
its
definitely
a
great
experience
you
can
easily
get
lost
in
drinkability
this
is
one
of
those
beers
where
drinkability
is
a
bit
of
a
judgment
call
in
that
i
dont
want
more
than
one
tonight
but
i
like
it
and
want
more
in
the
future
so
ill
go
with
this
being
high
in
drinkability
because
i
regretted
seeing
the
end
even
if
i
dont
want
to
open
another
right
now
this
beer
pours
a
deep
black
opaque
with
a
nice
dark
mocha
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
roast
with
a
touch
of
malt
fruitiness
theres
just
something
missing
for
me
the
flavor
has
a
touch
of
chocolate
but
again
is
mostly
a
mild
roasted
maltiness
there
are
some
hops
in
there
providing
an
interesting
bitterness
its
a
clean
stout
that
sticks
to
roastiness
for
its
character
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
of
this
character
but
im
just
being
picky
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
drinkability
is
good
12oz
literally
pours
black
with
no
transparency
nice
foamy
light
brown
head
keeps
a
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
good
roasted
malts
coffee
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
oatmeal
im
not
sure
if
any
oatmeal
was
used
in
the
brewing
process
but
the
aroma
was
definitely
reminiscent
of
an
oatmeal
stout
tastes
were
of
bitter
roasted
malts
with
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
bitter
roastiness
really
rides
out
all
the
way
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
plenty
of
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
ale
but
the
style
blurs
the
line
as
far
as
what
to
compare
it
to
it
seems
like
a
stout
to
me
but
the
brewer
does
call
it
a
strong
black
ale
very
good
whatever
it
might
be
american
strong
ale
my
ass
no
doubt
about
it
dark
horse
reserve
special
black
bier
is
clearly
a
stout
it
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
the
surface
there
is
little
to
no
lacing
on
the
glass
and
carbonation
is
subtle
aromas
of
this
beer
are
intense
with
roasty
malt
and
coffee
with
a
hint
of
fresh
potting
soil
flavors
are
similar
to
the
nose
but
much
more
prominent
the
roasted
malt
gives
the
beer
coffee
notes
along
with
bitter
chocolate
and
hints
of
damp
forest
floor
its
exceptionally
thick
you
dont
sip
his
beer
you
chew
this
fullbodied
beast
its
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i
think
it
should
be
given
credit
for
the
style
it
truly
is
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
go
dark
horse
d
it
was
good
not
something
i
would
particularly
seek
out
but
a
solid
brew
dthis
is
a
beer
i
would
order
if
i
was
out
for
dinner
but
it
may
be
a
tad
too
onedimensional
to
get
excited
about
this
beer
pours
a
nearly
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
an
inch
of
tan
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
roasted
malt
graham
cracker
cream
hints
of
blueberry
and
only
a
faint
gesture
of
hops
it
reminds
me
of
tres
blueberry
stout
but
a
lot
lighter
on
the
blueberries
the
taste
is
considerably
more
hoppy
than
the
aroma
both
in
the
mouth
and
in
the
finish
there
is
still
a
strong
presence
of
the
roasted
malt
and
graham
cracker
but
they
are
firmly
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
fuller
than
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
the
style
just
isnt
my
thing
im
eager
to
taste
a
beer
that
is
traditionally
malty
that
is
successfully
made
hoppy
as
is
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
maltiness
going
on
but
it
is
made
into
a
mess
by
the
hops
what
is
even
more
of
a
disappointment
it
that
the
malt
is
so
easily
visible
yet
its
goodness
is
completely
unattainable
due
to
the
mess
of
hops
bottle
courtesy
bulletrain76
pours
blackish
with
brown
highlights
and
a
dark
tan
head
aroma
is
straightforward
milk
and
dark
chocolates
with
maybe
a
lactose
note
super
roasty
flavor
with
black
roasted
burnt
barley
notes
and
an
even
bitterness
dry
maybe
a
bit
astringent
still
pretty
good
d
this
is
a
sipper
for
sure
super
rich
and
thick
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
ris
more
than
an
american
strong
ale
but
its
still
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
i
actually
got
quite
a
bit
of
hop
flavoring
in
this
beer
which
is
nice
however
it
is
kind
of
chalky
and
has
somewhat
flat
carbonation
levels
which
do
detract
from
the
overall
enjoyment
i
would
definetly
buy
it
again
eric
d
while
its
a
good
beer
it
lends
itself
to
the
sipping
type
this
beer
is
not
all
that
drinkable
at
all
but
it
i
wouldnt
say
it
reflects
negatively
on
all
the
other
aspects
at
all
this
is
another
beer
that
falls
into
the
not
good
not
bad
category
it
has
elements
of
both
a
strong
ale
and
a
stout
and
there
are
better
beers
available
in
both
of
those
categories
no
denying
that
its
a
good
one
its
style
agnostic
torn
between
an
sda
and
a
schwarzbier
but
its
one
of
the
best
tweeners
youll
come
upon
in
a
while
dark
horse
shorts
all
those
holeinthewall
michigan
outfits
are
pumping
out
quality
product
at
a
rate
that
gm
and
chrysler
would
be
proud
to
grovel
in
not
bad
definitely
would
reach
for
others
too
though
poured
a
beautiful
silky
black
with
rather
modest
head
the
head
is
darkbrown
like
the
crema
on
the
espresso
has
an
oily
look
and
dissipates
within
a
minute
to
a
thin
film
chocolate
notes
on
the
palate
rather
light
formation
of
belgian
lace
nice
lingering
medium
body
not
as
dense
as
the
color
and
pour
suggested
subdued
roasted
notes
hints
of
coffee
some
bitter
hops
i
like
it
but
am
not
overly
impressed
i
expected
more
ale
yeast
character
while
i
will
not
seek
it
out
it
is
better
than
a
great
many
beers
d
very
nice
over
all
though
i
think
there
are
better
example
of
the
style
still
very
good
and
well
worth
a
try
d
a
beer
worth
trying
for
sure
but
ultimately
this
one
just
didnt
gel
for
me
too
many
different
things
going
on
without
anything
to
pull
it
all
together
d
this
beer
has
a
good
abv
the
drinkability
is
good
i
like
the
finish
and
it
makes
you
want
more
good
drinkability
in
this
beer
d
fairly
high
i
love
this
style
and
will
definitely
continue
to
drink
overall
it
is
tastey
but
there
are
many
better
stouts
porters
and
strong
ales
out
there
seems
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
but
decent
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
another
very
good
beer
from
the
dark
horse
stable
really
nice
stuff
pours
a
dark
black
color
like
motor
oil
light
brown
or
tan
head
that
barely
covers
the
surface
and
is
slowly
breaking
down
mild
coffee
and
malt
nose
a
little
bit
of
moist
dough
perhaps
gentle
coffee
attack
that
carries
through
a
mostly
malty
flavor
and
ends
with
a
smoky
finish
thick
mouthfeel
slight
touch
of
hops
an
excellent
robust
beer
as
no
one
component
really
overpowers
you
but
you
still
know
its
a
big
beer
a
little
bit
bitter
or
sour
at
the
finish
lots
of
smoke
in
the
aftertaste
pours
incredibly
black
black
as
an
ris
nice
full
brown
head
smells
like
a
porter
on
steroids
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
some
burnt
malts
taste
is
similar
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
that
kicks
up
a
notch
as
it
warms
very
tasty
taste
of
a
very
good
imperial
porter
think
coffee
and
chocolate
with
a
little
alcohol
burn
with
a
more
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
imperial
stoutish
very
good
beer
another
winner
from
dh
im
not
certain
my
sample
wasnt
bad
it
was
shipped
laying
on
its
side
and
when
i
cracked
it
open
there
was
a
trail
of
something
that
had
situated
itself
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
stayed
there
after
i
poured
it
too
and
i
couldnt
get
the
sediment
out
even
after
rinsing
the
bottle
multiple
times
bought
it
as
a
single
bottle
on
the
way
home
tonight
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
a
dark
beer
as
the
label
pointed
out
formed
a
monster
head
right
out
of
the
bottle
and
was
nice
and
dark
definite
dark
black
in
color
very
very
hoppy
nice
it
was
so
dark
and
tasty
i
was
very
suprised
and
i
instantly
just
wanted
six
more
of
these
in
my
fridge
but
sadly
ill
have
to
wait
until
tomorrow
very
smooth
its
medium
bitter
and
has
a
nice
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
if
you
havent
checked
it
out
its
worth
it
i
know
i
should
have
a
long
time
ago
d
this
one
drinks
like
a
stout
it
is
a
bit
of
a
sipper
for
me
12
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
black
with
about
a
half
inch
brown
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
it
smells
like
roasted
malt
coffee
chocolate
and
also
a
little
bit
of
a
sweet
fruity
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
peach
but
im
not
sure
exactly
what
kind
of
fruit
it
smells
like
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
roastedburnt
malt
coffee
and
chocolate
theres
also
a
nice
lingering
roasty
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
a
bit
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
its
a
pretty
good
beer
id
definitely
buy
this
again
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
the
smell
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
i
highly
recommend
pretty
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
m
d
thick
and
viscous
mouthfeel
that
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
this
certainly
isnt
a
session
brew
in
my
opinion
more
like
a
second
meal
i
agree
with
other
reviews
ive
read
that
this
is
more
of
a
stout
than
an
american
strong
ale
overall
not
a
bad
brew
d
black
bier
in
name
only
drinks
like
a
stout
and
fills
you
up
like
one
too
a
very
sneaky
7

abv
an
american
strong
ale
that
wants
to
be
a
stout
interesting
a
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
im
in
love
with
this
style
of
beer
this
particular
selection
pours
black
black
like
molasses
with
a
remarkably
dark
tan
a
little
thin
head
that
was
gone
too
quickly
the
smell
is
chocolate
and
fruit
the
taste
was
nice
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
really
smooth
a
little
dry
at
the
end
but
it
lends
itself
to
the
dark
chocolate
flavor
overall
a
great
beer
i
will
be

surprisingly
strange
beer
but
a
very
good
one
a
high
abv
schwartzbier
essentially
not
quite
a
stout
or
a
porter
but
both
very
dark
and
still
very
light
the
fruity
notes
are
a
nice
touch
complimenting
the
epic
quantiy
of
toasted
malts
in
this
one
just
very
nice
good
stuff
overall
very
deliciois
and
easily
drinkable
good
carbonation
leaves
a
strong
aftertaste
d
this
is
very
stoutlike
bitter
malts
and
dark
7
5
is
well
hidden
theres
no
doubt
about
it
this
is
a
stout
and
a
pretty
good
one
at
that
theres
enough
roastiness
to
go
around
without
all
the
bitter
astringency
very
nice
brew
will
drink
again
very
pleasing
brew
dark
horse
makes
kick
ass
stouts
im
really
impressed
with
what
ive
had
thus
far
and
am
eager
to
move
on
to
the
others
the
only
noteable
flaw
here
is
the
mouthfeel
its
too
thin
more
thickness
would
go
a
long
way
but
this
is
a
very
very
good
beer
despite
that
small
flaw
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
nice
smooth
finish
on
the
palate
and
no
aftertaste
no
abv
listed
on
bottle
so
i
guessed
it
at
6
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
at
7
5
black
pour
with
a
serious
fluffy
brown
head
a
hoppybitter
aroma
flavor
is
of
chocolateand
coffee
as
promisedbut
not
bitter
at
all
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinker
nice
bodynice
mouthfeel
i
drank
the
whole
growler
myself
it
was
awesome
and
very
drinkable
thank
you
dark
horse
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
these
wonderful
beers
great
stout
definitely
a
wolf
in
sheeps
clothing
and
one
to
keep
your
eyes
out
for
dhard
to
drink
a
whole
lot
the
taste
is
very
strong
and
the
beer
is
pretty
alcoholic
for
such
a
dark
big
flavored
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
thin
i
would
have
hoped
for
something
more
commanding
the
quaffability
of
the
brew
is
enhanced
by
a
lightmedium
body
with
mild
carbonation
and
the
bitterness
smoldering
in
the
aftertaste
begs
for
another
quenching
sip
an
excellent
brew
thanks
to
dr
brad
for
the
bottle
a
surprise
heavier
than
i
expected
a
decent
beer
more
of
a
stout
than
anything
worth
a
try
dark
ebony
brew
with
a
nice
stout
quality
quite
thick
not
as
strong
but
richly
backed
alcohol
nice
chocolate
in
a
good
bottle
alcohol
gives
it
a
cherry
hint
on
the
palate
soft
coffee
great
malt
warm
going
down
with
a
light
smokey
dessert
like
quality
light
woodiness
not
the
most
consistent
excellent
a
little
below
cellar
temperature
somewhere
between
american
double
and
goose
island
bourbon
county
candy
fruit
rummy
yet
light
when
it
shines
will
have
again
drinkability
overall
not
necessarily
a
bad
beer
but
it
lacks
complexity
and
could
use
a
little
more
balance
near
black
pour
healthy
brown
head
slight
ruby
around
the
edge
very
roasty
aroma
tastes
roasted
malt
burnt
malt
oat
bakers
chocolate
some
smokiness
a
pleasant
amount
of
carbonation
just
a
slight
amount
of
hop
and
coffee
bitterness
in
the
finish
almost
as
much
coffee
in
this
to
me
as
the
beer
geek
breakfast
stout
very
good
and
to
the
point
of
what
a
good
porter
should
be
a
good
beer
but
it
did
not
live
up
to
my
expectations
the
flavor
just
has
too
much
of
a
burnt
taste
to
warrant
continued
consumption
the
high
abv
limits
it
as
well

very
delicious
brew
definatly
a
stout
in
my
mind
d
very
approachable
ale
with
some
interesting
and
fairly
intense
flavors
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
ale
not
a
bad
drinker
but
the
abv
is
pretty
ubiquitous
got
to
me
very
quickly
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
falls
pretty
quickly
smell
is
mainly
sweet
up
front
along
with
a
bit
of
roast
and
hop
bitterness
molasses
some
dark
fruit
almost
milk
chocolate
decent
sized
roast
character
kind
of
husky
and
grainy
with
a
light
nutty
scent
taste
is
much
of
the
same
a
bit
all
over
the
place
but
when
together
it
is
nice
more
of
a
roast
presence
than
sweetness
in
flavor
definitely
a
hop
presence
that
doesnt
work
so
well
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
this
seems
like
a
schwarzbierstout
hybrid
with
a
hop
presence
that
is
a
little
over
the
top
mouthfeel
is
actually
nice
creamy
and
the
hop
presence
doesnt
create
a
huge
bitterness
actually
seems
like
a
schwarzbier
type
feel
but
a
little
bigger
a
little
smoky
in
the
finish
along
with
roast
not
overly
bitter
again
overall
fairly
drinkable
but
not
the
most
exciting
brew
in
the
world
its
interesting
but
still
not
completely
convincing
somewhat
boozy
which
hurts
this
one
maybe
a
bit
less
hoppy
goodness
and
tune
up
on
the
stoutage
i
think
it
could
be
great
bottom
line
this
is
my
second
dark
horse
brew
ive
gotten
in
a
trade
with
joe
and
i
really
like
what
this
brewery
is
putting
out
there
and
apparently
a
lot
of
other
bas
do
too
way
to
go
regardless
if
i
dont
agree
with
the
style
very
enjoyable
brew
not
entirely
complex
or
over
the
top
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
excellent
beer
the
style
is
up
in
the
air
but
the
flavor
was
nailed
down
very
nicely
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
this
one
any
day
a
solid
beer
for
sure
and
something
they
can
be
proud
of
wouldnt
have
picked
this
up
myself
if
i
saw
it
but
thanks
to
lightindarkness
for
sending
it
to
me
i
definately
enjoyed
it
and
would
drink
another
on
a
cold
snowy
day
or
with
a
meal
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
pours
jet
black
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
this
dark
for
some
reason
poured
with
no
head
what
so
ever
smell
is
roasted
malts
taste
is
light
up
front
with
a
roasted
finish
although
no
carbonation
seemed
to
be
present
at
the
pour
there
is
a
subtle
bit
in
the
mouth
and
its
pretty
prefect
this
beer
caught
me
off
guard
and
i
am
glad
it
did
sucks
i
only
have
one
the
aroma
is
rich
with
smokey
chocolate
reminds
me
of
old
rasputin
and
i
could
smell
it
the
second
i
opened
the
bottle
the
flavor
is
full
of
dark
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
sweet
cherry
and
bitter
grapefruit
the
body
is
a
medium
thickness
but
still
very
drinkable
this
is
a
damn
tasty
beer
especially
for
chocolate
lovers
dark
horse
also
now
available
in
the
stl
area
life
is
beer
good
pours
a
solid
ebony
colour
with
slight
tan
head
and
reasonable
lacing
nose
chocolate
milk
powder
and
roasted
nuts
taste
dark
fruits
chocolate
touch
of
lactic
sourness
and
a
little
smokiness
medium
bodied
with
a
vigorous
carbonation
finishes
dry
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
darker
and
maltier
beers
than
this
is
a
good
one
for
you
its
definitely
worth
drinking
a
few
of
if
youre
the
mood
for
that
type
of
beer
drinkability
is
good
for
a
brew
this
rich
and
complex
the
body
and
finish
are
not
typical
in
that
they
resemble
a
lighter
and
more
drinkable
brew
almost
like
a
superrich
porter
this
brew
is
a
solid
example
of
whatever
style
it
has
been
slotted
into
cheers
i
saw
a
bottle
of
this
sitting
by
itself
in
the
liquor
store
so
i
picked
it
up
and
damn
i
am
impressed
this
black
bier
is
obviously
supposed
to
be
a
stout
i
assume
really
nice
flavors
though
tasting
like
something
between
a
big
imperial
porter
and
a
small
imperial
stout
d
if
i
had
a
blind
taste
test
id
swear
this
is
a
stout
its
something
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
a
night
but
not
one
ill
always
have
on
hand
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
is
a
dark
coffee
color
with
minimal
head
and
then
the
carbonation
erupts
after
the
pour
into
a
milk
chocolate
head
that
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
is
full
of
chocolate
coffee
and
even
some
of
the
alcohol
there
is
a
slight
burnt
note
in
the
nose
as
well
the
flavor
is
excellent
strong
malt
flavor
deep
roasted
taste
with
a
heavy
burnt
backdrop
and
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
the
carbonation
is
light
with
a
medium
syrup
body
this
is
a
solid
beer
and
i
will
enjoy
more
to
come
pours
black
in
color
sludgy
out
of
the
bottle
nice
big
cocoacolored
head
fades
down
to
a
thin
layer
on
top
of
the
beer
excellent
lacing
smell
is
incredible
milk
chocolate
molasses
plenty
of
coffee
slightly
doughy
now
this
is
effing
delicious
taste
is
bitter
coffee
plenty
of
chocolate
a
faint
smokiness
slightly
burnt
around
the
edges
wow
mouthfeel
is
really
interesting
feels
more
like
a
porter
tastes
more
like
a
stout
great
lingering
bitterness
perfect
coffee
aftertaste
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
excellent
brew
even
an
aggressive
pour
produced
only
a
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
receded
to
just
a
slight
ring
around
the
top
of
this
black
opaque
beer
smell
is
toffee
and
roasted
malt
with
a
noticeable
fruity
sweetness
that
seems
somewhat
out
of
place
taste
follows
but
without
the
fruitiness
very
nice
dark
chocolate
with
some
hop
bitterness
finish
lasts
a
good
long
time
and
maintains
that
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
but
a
little
soft
on
the
carbonation
drinkable
nice
huge
thanks
yet
once
more
to
rblwthacoz
for
this
surprise
extra
to
what
was
already
an
unexpected
beer
drop
i
do
so
enjoy
being
surprised
with
beer
and
in
this
case
surprised
by
a
beer
d
tastes
smells
feels
and
looks
like
a
stout
so
why
not
call
it
one
a
bit
too
roasted
for
my
tastes
and
kind
of
cloying
in
the
finish
not
my
favorite
stout
nor
my
favorite
dark
horse
offering
d
smooth
but
intense
quite
drinkable
this
was
my
first
beer
last
night
the
crawfish
boil
i
had
low
expectations
from
what
locals
told
me
about
the
brewery
but
damn
they
were
wrong
this
was
an
incredibly
well
crafted
beer
it
poured
black
with
a
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
toasted
malts
and
caramel
i
was
very
delighted
with
the
flavor
certainly
alot
of
caramel
flavors
in
it
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinking
beer
for
a
dark
beer
and
it
felt
just
wonderful
in
my
mouth
thanks
for
a
great
brew
this
beer
was
super
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
seeking
it
out
if
only
for
the
smell
d
if
you
like
coffee
very
ill
definitely
recommend
this
to
others
and
try
to
get
my
hands
on
another
the
next
time
that
i
see
it
it
reminds
me
of
a
couple
of
foudners
beers
and
thats
always
nice
for
me
one
of
my
favorite
dark
horse
offerings
d
d
i
really
like
this
beer
and
would
compare
it
to
a
decent
ris
or
porter
nice
and
roasty
overall
decent
id
be
up
for
trying
another
bottle
to
see
if
it
is
any
better
yet
the
heavy
malty
texture
makes
up
for
a
lot
coating
the
tongue
not
unlike
a
good
denselyhopped
ipa
does
smooth
and
rich
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
one
of
the
more
distinct
beers
ive
had
rich
and
bold
well
worth
trying
d
i
could
probably
go
through
a
6pack
of
these
if
you
left
it
in
front
of
me
this
is
a
delicious
brew
that
id
easily
mistake
for
an
doubleimperial
stout
awesome
flavors
awesome
mouthfeel
they
should
just
call
this
a
double
stout
and
be
done
with
it
either
way
im
off
to
find
me
some
more
this
would
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
if
i
had
easy
access
to
it
tastes
like
a
stout
to
me
rich
and
creamy
with
an
assertive
charcoal
roasted
malt
middle
fresh
ground
coffee
wth
a
hint
of
vanilla
and
caramel
almost
espresso
in
the
finish
with
currant
and
raisin
low
to
moderate
carbonation
pretty
substantial
full
rich
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
if
youre
a
coffeelover
drinkability
call
it
a
porter
or
a
stout
or
an
old
ale
if
you
like
but
youll
likely
call
it
tasty
as
well
good
one
for
cold
weather
with
a
bowl
of
chili
pours
pitch
black
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
really
sticks
around
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
i
mean
its
just
amazing
to
look
at
the
nose
is
a
very
nice
amount
of
coffee
i
could
look
and
smell
this
beer
all
night
but
thats
not
what
were
here
for
damnit
wow
flavor
is
pretty
smoked
but
not
in
the
realm
of
a
thick
ol
rauch
nice
very
full
and
robust
there
is
a
sweet
edge
to
this
but
not
in
the
way
of
a
milk
stout
it
is
almost
like
a
natural
sweetness
it
just
happens
to
be
there
it
seems
man
this
is
amazing
stuff
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
cask
version
of
it
might
have
kicked
it
up
quite
a
bit
but
the
bottle
version
is
really
bringing
the
love
too
this
is
an
absolutely
amazing
beer
to
be
shared
with
people
who
care
thank
you
fairy

thank

thick

darkness

a
very
nice
addition

undertones
as
well
complex
and
super
roasty
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
as
i
havent
had
anything
from
this
brewery
yet
but
i
was
quite
impressed
the
fact
that
they
make
this
beer
year
round
is
fantastic
as
well
a
solid
brew
from
a
solid
crew
definitely
a
repeat
buy
pours
big
and
black
with
a
smallish
tan
head
smell
is
dark
and
roasty
with
a
big
smoky
tone
to
it
although
the
flavor
of
dark
smoky
roastiness
was
nice
it
was
a
bit
thinner
bodied
than
expected
overall
didnt
get
any
coffee
flavors
in
this
would
definitely
like
to
try
again
and
a
nicely
made
beer
thanks
chris
i
feel
like
ive
been
overly
negative
hence
this
afterword
ive
more
or
less
rated
this
an
imperial
stout
or
double
stout
as
that
is
what
i
feel
it
most
resembles
its
enjoyable
no
doubt
especially
at
its
price
point
but
lacking
compared
to
the
competition
to
me
this
is
quite
reminiscent
of
old
rasputin
something
that
i
know
isnt
bestinclass
in
my
world
but
i
buy
periodically
since
the
price
is
attractive
yet
every
time
i
still
feel
a
little
bit
cheated
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
good
to
have
around
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
one
initially
thought
it
would
be
a
schwartzbier
pours
an
almost
black
body
with
a
small
cocoa
head
that
has
some
garnet
hues
some
nice
sheet
lacing
looks
like
a
stout
aroma
of
burnt
dark
malt
chocolate
and
red
apples
medium
body
has
a
subdued
carbonation
taste
has
a
biter
bite
from
both
hops
and
dark
roasted
malts
a
red
apple
fruitiness
softens
the
edges
quite
a
bit
a
very
interesting
brew
here
more
like
a
stout
than
anything
else
dthe
smoke
can
get
to
be
a
bit
much
but
there
is
a
a
lot
to
like
here
i
am
enjoying
this
though
that
aftertaste
can
be
a
bit
of
a
hurdle
poured
from
12oz
bottle
into
new
belgium
snifter
poured
a
midnight
black
color
with
mocha
tan
head
smell
is
mixture
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
coffee
taste
is
burnt
flavors
of
malt
and
coffee
with
a
sweet
finish
mouthfeel
is
full
body
with
a
low
level
of
carbonation
that
helps
maintain
its
creamy
feel
a
great
drinking
beer
with
a
huge
body
and
bold
flavors
drinkability
very
nice
packed
with
flavor
but
relatively
light
enough
to
pound
down
a
few
of
these
even
at
700am
in
the
morning
dthis
brewery
almost
always
delivers
nice
crisp
stout
that
any
stout
fan
would
enjoy
d
nice
drinkable
brew
doesnt
overpower
and
has
a
nice
roastyness
about
it
this
was
a
great
beer
glad
i
got
the
opportunity
to
give
this
one
a
whirl
full
bodied
terrific
carbonation
smooth
slightly
dry
in
the
finish
as
well
certainly
worth
the
effort
to
get
this
one
very
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
cap
of
fine
bubbles
good
head
retention
with
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
full
of
toffee
roast
milk
chocolate
with
some
sour
cherry
and
caramel
notes
leafy
hop
bitterness
that
started
strong
and
grew
into
the
finish
caramel
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
mild
roast
and
semisweet
chocolate
then
dry
cocoa
towards
the
end
followed
by
lingering
cherry
medium
to
full
bodied
with
very
low
carbonation
a
little
heavy
good
stuff
and
an
easy
drinking
bigger
beer
unfortunately
the
carbonation
was
just
a
little
too
low
and
didnt
do
the
beer
justice
a
well
crafted
stout
the
nose
was
underwhelming
but
the
flavor
is
big
but
balanced
bitterness
complemented
with
sweetness
and
no
off
flavors
here
an
easy
drinker
for
the
high
abv
this
one
doesnt
seem
balanced
enough
for
me
for
some
reason
too
much
bitterness
in
the
finish
for
me
not
enough
balance
one
of
these
is
enough
but
worth
trying
not
my
thing
d
i
think
for
the
style
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
it
possesses
all
of
the
imperial
stout
character
without
being
unnecessarily
heavy
or
daunting
the
taste
however
is
not
shy
with
a
fine
carbonation
and
coating
texture
the
bitterness
sinks
into
the
tongue
roasted
toasted
and
burnt
to
a
crisp
malts
anise
molasses
maybe
some
coffee
and
a
woody
something
the
burp
tastes
pretty
good
too
the
body
however
looses
some
strength
feeling
a
bit
thinner
later
one
thing
i
must
say
i
dont
know
how
accurate
these
classifications
of
stoutdouble
stoutimpywhatever
but
this
beer
is
called
a
black
bier
by
its
maker
and
it
tastes
just
like
that
black
dark
mean
with
no
redeeming
qualities
tasty
heavy
body
and
thick
smooth
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
drinkability
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
onedimensional
and
lacking
in
balance
thanks
to
pegasus
for
sharing
a
bottle
d
a
big
tasty
stout
one
of
the
best
of
the
lot
ive
enjoyed
and
my
first
from
dark
horse
huge
chocolate
and
coffee
bittering
will
make
this
memorable
its
one
i
must
have
again
somewhere
down
the
road
like
buckeyenation
wrote
below
i
also
thought
this
was
a
schwarzbier
so
the
imperial
stoutgoodness
was
a
pleasant
surprise
thanks
again
derek
for
sending
ive
been
looking
for
this
beer
for
some
time
now
thanks
talisker
maybe
it
was
the
goofy
cartoon
donkey
on
the
label
maybe
it
was
the
proven
stout
excellence
of
the
brewmasters
at
dark
horse
who
knows
all
you
need
to
know
is
that
reserve
special
black
bier
is
a
lip
smackingly
good
stout
lovers
stout
drinkability
id
have
another
but
dont
know
how
many
i
could
have
in
a
night
great
for
havin
with
some
fellow
beer
nerds
pretty
good
i
will
definitly
be
looking
for
more
of
this
very
dark
brown
in
pour
with
a
quarter
inch
thick
light
brown
head
that
dissapates
quickly
and
leaves
little
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
chocolate
roasted
coffee
flavor
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
also
a
hint
of
chocolate
present
but
not
as
much
as
was
in
the
aroma
creamy
and
thick
on
the
palate
but
lightens
up
to
a
relatively
cleaner
finish
low
to
moderate
carbonation
well
balanced
and
complex
i
absolutely
love
this
place
another
high
quality
brew
from
dark
horse
ive
sampled
three
or
four
of
their
offerings
all
being
darker
heavier
styles
and
everyone
was
excellent
i
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
to
the
brewers
at
dark
horse
please
find
a
distrubutor
in
chicagoland
overall
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
could
see
drinking
this
as
a
nightcapwinterwarmer
throughout
the
cooler
months
drinkability
easy
to
drink
seems
to
have
low
abv
and
is
not
as
heavy
as
many
stouts
could
use
a
more
complex
taste
though
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
night
which
gives
it
a
good
score
here
decent
stout
overall
not
great
but
good
served
a
a
deep
brown
with
a
dark
tan
head
the
head
was
14
inch
tall
when
they
brought
it
to
me
and
it
quickly
fell
to
a
ring
around
the
perimeter
when
i
smelled
it
i
knew
it
was
either
a
baltic
porter
or
a
big
stout
chocolate
malt
roasted
and
burnt
slight
flavoring
hops
poking
through
and
carbon
the
taste
was
big
bold
burnt
at
first
then
regressing
to
more
of
a
nutty
flavor
bitter
hops
right
at
the
end
dry
it
out
for
the
next
sip
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
chewy
and
bitter
the
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
perfect
black
beer
with
no
highlights
at
all
big
three
fingers
of
reddish
tan
frothy
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
all
the
way
down
nose
is
really
strong
on
dried
fruit
prunes
and
some
light
roasted
malt
and
spices
taste
is
likewise
spice
up
front
then
strong
dried
fruit
a
ton
of
roasted
malt
shows
up
later
on
in
the
flavor
very
tasty
beer
although
perhaps
not
the
most
complex
creamy
full
bodied
with
solid
carbonation
liked
this
one
a
lot
the
big
flavor
totally
covers
the
alcohol
although
thesell
catch
up
with
you
if
you
dont
pay
attention
this
is
likely
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
the
beer
is
pitch
black
with
a
decent
tan
head
some
lacing
but
not
too
much
the
smell
is
oatmealchocolate
and
some
coffee
the
same
things
show
up
in
the
taste
the
beer
is
very
smooth
for
the
style
the
abv
does
not
show
drinkability
is
high
maybe
a
little
too
high
as
this
beer
is
good
enough
that
it
could
pose
some
problems
near
the
end
of
the
sixer
this
beer
pours
a
shiny
black
color
with
a
thin
light
beige
head
that
turns
wispy
quickly
very
little
lacing
apparent
roasted
malt
and
caramel
aroma
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
a
pleasant
roasted
character
coffee
malt
and
hops
flavors
make
this
one
enjoyable
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
leaves
a
charred
wood
aftertaste
one
of
the
better
porters
i
have
tasted
in
awhile
d
this
was
wonderful
and
i
will
definitely
be
enjoying
this
on
a
regular
basis
less
than
10
a
6pack
highly
recommended
thank
goodness
i
bought
a
sixer
but
this
beer
is
worthy
of
a
case
purchase
very
nice
and
unusual
dry
double
american
stout
d
not
bad
but
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
of
the
black
ales
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
wonderful
beer
its
kind
of
potent
so
i
dont
think
id
have
too
many
of
them
in
one
session
but
its
definitely
worth
picking
up
more
i
got
this
one
in
a
mixed
6er
update
april
9th
2008
well
i
didnt
wait
2
years
but
this
bottle
is
now
about
1
year
and
3
months
old
aroma
is
still
amazing
theres
a
lactic
sourness
i
didnt
notice
before
and
the
upfront
bitterness
has
had
its
edge
taken
off
by
a
milk
chocolate
sweetness
in
the
background
id
bet
that
that
sweetness
would
develop
further
if
id
let
the
bottle
sit
a
little
longer
i
like
the
balance
and
the
interplay
here
still
smoky
and
very
bitter
and
roasted
but
just
a
hint
of
molasses
and
chocolate
taking
the
edge
off
much
less
one
dimensional
than
even
8
months
ago
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
balls
out
d
pretty
solid
im
in
a
definite
mood
for
stouts
and
this
is
perfect
the
lower
abv
and
balanced
hops
and
heavy
mouthfeel
without
ridiculous
maltiness
make
this
more
drinkable
than
many
double
american
stouts
the
counterpart
to
dipas
and
the
other
end
of
the
color
and
richness
scale
highly
recommended
light
feeling
as
it
first
hits
the
tongue
it
picks
up
a
medium
fullness
to
it
as
it
moves
across
the
tongue
the
finish
is
marred
by
an
astringent
sharp
almost
harsh
burnt
bitter
note
that
is
thankfully
not
too
overwhelming
notes
of
bitter
french
roast
black
coffee
darkly
toasted
bread
a
burnt
acidity
and
a
acrid
char
flavor
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
darkly
roasted
grain
character
it
is
actually
a
bit
much
but
on
the
upside
i
think
that
it
is
helping
to
hide
some
off
flavors
that
are
derived
from
a
bit
of
diacetyl
and
perhaps
some
vegetal
notes
in
the
end
the
dark
malt
is
just
a
bit
too
much
if
the
gravity
was
bumped
up
a
bit
it
might
be
more
in
balance
pours
a
tar
like
color
no
light
is
comin
through
this
one
two
finger
dark
khaki
colored
head
that
slowly
dies
down
to
a
very
nice
lacing
stickiness
is
amazing
smell
is
of
dark
chocolate
with
roasted
nutty
malt
that
overpowers
the
nose
taste
is
of
strong
espresso
and
black
coffee
with
a
nice
hop
bite
that
quickly
moves
in
quite
a
surprise
aftertaste
is
somewhat
bready
with
more
of
that
black
coffee
flavoring
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
right
and
flavorful
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
but
one
is
good
enough
for
me
definitely
look
forward
to
more
beers
from
dark
horse
drinkability
nice
stout
nice
sipper
for
me
on
tap
at
ashleys
in
ann
arborpoured
a
near
jet
black
but
there
was
a
noticable
crimson
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
thinner
quick
to
faid
almond
colored
head
atop
aromas
were
roasted
and
sweet
with
notes
of
molasses
and
french
roast
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
no
hop
presence
to
this
one
big
and
sweet
up
front
with
some
molasses
and
dark
fruit
notes
very
roasty
with
just
a
hint
of
earth
in
the
finish
wich
doesnt
dry
it
out
much
its
a
big
hearty
beer
sweet
and
it
packs
a
punch
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
it
is
my
first
dark
horse
beer
and
i
would
love
to
find
more
medium
feeling
that
leaves
a
little
alcohol
and
less
carbonation
beer
seems
to
remind
me
of
the
breakfast
stout
in
the
first
impression
but
that
comparisson
quickly
fades
away
as
the
beer
does
not
stay
on
the
same
level
throughout
the
beer
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
some
delectable
stuff
the
abv
is
never
harsh
but
a
buzz
is
felt
by
the
end
of
the
glass
dont
let
this
donkey
kick

ass
bottle
courtesy
of
moejuck

beer
with
a
medium
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
medium
coffee
with
light
roasted
malt
taste
is
dominated
by
some
medium
dry
coffee
with
some
light
roasted
malt
and
some
nice
oatmeal
notes
body
is
quite
creamy
which
i
always
enjoy
as
well
as
being
full
with
some
medium
to
low
carbonation
well
done
and
something
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
one
weak
spot
in
this
beer
is
the
body
the
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
prefer
the
body
nearly
approaches
medium
the
carbonation
is
low
but
not
problematic
the
flavors
are
long
lasting
the
beer
provided
a
very
pleasant
beer
drinking
experience
and
i
will
have
this
one
again
this
is
pretty
damn
drinkable
to
have
this
strong
of
a
flavor
but
i
like
my
stouts
like
this
and
not
overloaded
with
sweet
flavors
overall
its
very
simple
with
dark
toasted
flavors
but
just
good
good
stuff
a
must
try
cheers
d
fantastic
roasty
flavors
as
well
as
the
sneaky
undercurrent
of
dark
fruit
and
molassas
a
very
rewarding
treat
drinkability
a
really
special
beer
that
i
have
enjoyed
again
and
again
taste
is
rich
milk
chocolate
with
hints
of
coffee
body
is
a
bit
thinner
than
id
like
but
its
still
shockingly
smooth
yes
sir
i
reckon
id
buy
this
again
if
i
could
d
im
finding
it
difficult
to
make
my
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
beer
is
trying
to
grow
on
me
and
partially
succeeds
as
it
warms
up
a
little
a
sipper
more
by
force
and
not
by
choice
pours
a
very
opaque
black
very
dark

russ
4s
across
the
board
for
this
above
average
stout
it
sits
heavily
in
a
pint
glass
deep
black
with
a
bit
of
a
brown
head
and
good
lacing
nose
is
lots
of
roasted

and
some
smokiness
taste
is
roasted
malts
in
good
amounts
tiny
hints
of
alcohol
and
sweetness
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
good
nice
job
dark
horse
drinkability
a
very
flavorful
and
full

drink
good
for
sipping
on
a
cold
winters
night
overall
a
tremendous
brew
from
dark
horse
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
kickintheass
double
stout
this
is
a
worthy
opponent
a
very
nice
beer
a
very
good
offering
from
dark
horse
and
ill
seek
out
more
of
their
beers
if
you
see
this
beer
definitely
pick
it
up
amber
brown
pour
and
a
bit
hazy
very
sweet
palate
with
a
bit
citrus
and
malt
goes
down
easy
with
little
carbonation
as
hoppy
as
i
would
expect
from
a
double
but
enjoyable
the
beer
is
a
above
average
to
very
good
india
pale
ale
in
the
american
style
laet
the
beer
stand
a
bit
if
to
cold
as
it
comprimizes
the
delevery
of
this
beer
great
bottle
drinkability
is
ok
the
strong
roast
and
astringency
takes
away
from
this
one
a
bit
but
its
still
nice
a
little
warm
on
the
way
down
might
be
better
with
some
time
to
mellow

thick
chewy
feel
very
well
done
and
an
amazing
value
at

99
a
sixpack
thank
you
darkhorse
bold
and
strong
but
also
very
drinkable
and
very
aromatic
delicious
and
welltempered
throughout
the
session
highly
recommended
d
pretty
darn
good
id
have
a
couple
of
these
make
a
fresh
comment
about
the
waitress
ask
for
a
smoke
and
feel
like
heaven
is
a
place
on
earth
because
of
beer
d
the
slow
start
is
discouraging
but
the
finish
is
nice
this
stout
is
above
average
a
good
glass
if
you
can
find
it
mouthfeel
is
thin
this
beer
is
smooth
with
the
taste
delivering
a
certain
bitter
bite
thats
a
good
thing
but
needs
more
carbonation
it
feels
flat
to
me
looks
like
some
black
viscous
sludge
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
off
deep
deep
deep
roasted
mlats
that
give
the
idea
of
very
strong
but
slightly
stale
coffee
grounds
the
taste
brings
some
more
bitterness
to
the
mix
to
help
round
out
this
great
stout
the
bitter
coffee
with
some
nice
smokey
creams
to
give
some
sweetness
to
such
an
overwhelming
beer
to
the
senses
soliky
even
oily
smooth
on
the
tongue
goes
down
very
easy
for
its
thickness
not
to
bad
dryness
or
aftertaste
gets
to
me
after
a
bit
but
overall
a
good
beer
d
black
beer
for
sure
something
different
which
is
nice
good
thing
this
one
comes
in
a
12oz
bottle
anything
bigger
would
be
tough
d
mediocre
it
is
isnt
that
quaffable
and
it
is
strong
abv
the
burnt
malt
make
the
flavor
though
initially
quite
pleasant
something
you
dont
want
to
keep
having
d
high
abv
goes
unmasked
easy
drinking
and
smooth
bitterness
was
bigger
than
i
expected
it
to
be
sometimes
garnering
to
much
attention
by
overpowering
the
other
flavors
a
nice
winter
drink
mellow
and
wellcrafted
dark
horse
seems
to
specialize
in
stouts
that
means
theyre
competing
against
bells
in
michigan
no
less
and
this
is
the
finest
one
ive
tasted
from
them
a
serious
and
charismatic
brew
recommended
i
thought
this
was
a
black
beer
and
not
a
stout
but
it
is
all
double
stout
dark
thick
and
a
beautiful
dark
brown
head
the
nose
was
also
a
wonderful
compliment
of
bitter
chocolate
toffee
and
dark
coffee
the
taste
was
solid
but
the
worst
mouthfeel
i
have
ever
felt
in
this
style
aside
from
this
flaw
it
is
tasty
overall
after
reading
all
of
the
good
reviews
of
this
beer
im
sincerely
hoping
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
i
really
enjoy
dark
horses
too
cream
stout
and
so
i
was
excited
to
give
this
one
a
try
not
a
terrible
experience
but
i
am
disappointed
because
it
was
just
okay
in
every
sense
of
the
word
perhaps
ill
revisit
in
the
future
dont
judge
a
beer
by
its
label
art
goofey
looking
donkey
artwork
on
the
label
undermines
the
true
gem
inside
this
pours
motoroil
black
with
a
nice
dark
brown
head
which
i
got
after
coaxing
it
with
a
hard
pour
pleasant
vinous
aroma
with
cocoa
and
chocolate
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fullbodied
this
is
a
big
stout
all
the
way
chocolate
and
roastedburnt
malt
on
the
front
end
a
dry
stoutlike
bitterness
follows
hints
of
oak
and
burnt
raisin
in
the
middle
theres
a
dry
hop
bitterness
toward
the
back
finishes
with
layered
chocolate
and
alcohol
very
solid
yet
unassuming
double
stout
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
disapointing
head
it
is
very
thick
as
it
pours
far
from
watery
the
aroma
as
it
pours
smacks
you
right
in
the
face
very
coffee
sweet
bitter
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
it
almost
hits
like
a
porter
the
beer
is
rather
sharp
for
such
a
thick
looking
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
i
expected
alcohol
is
present
in
the
back
pretty
good
would
not
buy
again
however
but
worth
a
try
overall
a
harsh
and
not
so
subtle
beer
it
smells
and
looks
wonderful
but
doesnt
beg
to
please
the
tastebuds
highly
recommended
the
flavor
is
quite
strong
which
i
appreciate
however
it
seems
a
bit
burnt
chocolate
coffee
and
bitter
at
least
its
interesting
the
other
beers
i
reviewed
tonight
i
complained
about
the
lack
of
strong
flavor
this
beer
has
strong
flavor
even
if
some
of
it
is
in
the
negative
however
its
a
quality
i
was
looking
for
this
beer
has
something
going
on
and
if
it
hits
your
goals
itll
be
a
favorite
taste
is
very
dry
kind
of
harsh
on
the
back
of
the
throat
and
coats
the
toungue
very
roasty
too
much
roast
not
enough
malt
base
to
cover
some
of
this
harshness
pours
an
dark
black
color
with
a
tan
and
darker
brown
colored
head
looks
nice
and
creamy
smell
is
hoppy
roasty
and
chocolatey
taste
is
slightly
astringent
but
plenty
of
hops
in
there
and
a
nice
cocoa
flavor
and
a
roasty
undertone
to
help
balance
things
out
quite
good
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
with
lower
carbonation
just
about
perfect
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
plan
on
getting
again
i
think
this
one
will
get
even
better
with
age
a
hypothesis
i
plan
to
test
out
drinkability
pretty
good
not
my
favourite
dh
beer
deep
black
with
a
seriously
nice
tan
head
slight
head
lingers
on
the
surface
down
the
glass
nice
roasted
aromasomewhat
of
a
cross
between
mocha
and
a
fine
grade
of
chocolate
somewhat
faint
but
a
pleasant
aroma
overall
big
killer
chocolate
flavor
huge
graininess
with
a
mellow
very
rounded
roasted
flavor
just
a
great
mix
good
body
but
the
grainy
flavor
leaves
it
a
bit
dry
overall
very
very
drinkable
beer
the
drygrain
flavor
is
a
tad
much
but
very
yummy
indeed
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
drinkabilityoverall
a
nice
roasty
bitter
mild
drinkable
double
stout
a
nice
alternative
to
storm
king
in
the
category
glad
to
see
another
good
brewery
being
distributed
in
madison
bring
it
on
d
a
solid
stout
that
is
just
slightly
astringent
the
bottom
line
a
pretty
tasty
stout
offering
by
the
guys
from
dark
horse
does
a
nice
job
of
incorporating
hops
strongly
without
making
them
unbalance
the
brew
and
make
it
less
enjoyable
opaque
black
beer
with
a
thin
tan
head
tan
film
hangs
around
and
does
give
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
a
big
wow
bitter
chocolate
burnt
coffee
smokeyness
taste
is
so
nice
and
full
this
is
one
i
wish
i
would
have
bought
more
of
chocolate
taste
up
front
that
turns
into
a
nice
burnt
coffee
bitterness
finishes
dry
with
a
smokey
aftertaste
i
will
have
this
beer
every
chance
i
get
one
of
the
biggest
suprises
ive
ever
had
in
beer
tasting
the
label
sure
makes
this
look
like
an
amateur
beer
but
everything
else
about
it
says
that
these
guys
know
what
theyre
doing
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
quite
as
much
as
bells
batch
7000
but
its
right
up
there
in
my
book
i
really
wish
i
could
find
this
beer
in
my
area
good
thing
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
michigan
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
and
formed
a
black
hole
that
seemed
to
swallow
all
light
that
tried
to
enter
it
it
formed
a
light
tan
head
that
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
heavy
of
malt
and
coffee
the
flavor
was
of
malt
burnt
coffee
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
it
had
a
medium
body
with
a
slight
burnt
aspect
to
the
finish
all
in
all
a
good
beer
d
this
is
a
wonderfully
delicious
beer
for
the
style
and
the
best
new
find
of
my
michigan
trip
i
wish
it
were
more
readily
available
on
the
east
coast
this
one
pours
beautifully
with
a
thick
but
not
sludgy
body
and
a
brilliant
dark
brown
head
the
aroma
is
primarily
of
roasted
malts
lots
of
burny
smells
the
taste
is
bitter
bitter
bitter
tons
of
roasted
malt
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
something
sour
at
the
end
theres
also
a
bit
of
egg
cream
and
cookie
spices
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
but
not
nearly
as
thick
as
a
lot
of
imperial
and
double
stouts
out
there
this
enhances
the
drinkability
considerably
as
it
makes
dark
horse
a
substantial
but
not
a
huge
beer
high
marks
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
very
good
at
what
it
does
have
doesnt
strike
me
as
8
another
plus
strangely
refreshing
without
sacrificing
body
thats
a
strange
bird
alright
recommended
black
with
a
small
burnt
unber
head
opaque
and
very
think
and
sludgy
looking
roasted
malt
odor
pretty
standard
for
the
type
burnt
taste
is
predominant
some
creaminess
some
hops
on
finish
giving
it
a
good
bitterness
hops
keep
it
interesting
beyond
the
burnt
roastiness
very
toasty
overall
pretty
satisfying
going
to
have
to
visit
dark
horse
up
in
mi
sometime
soon
to
drink
from
their
taps
12
oz
botle
pours
as
black
as
can
be
with
a
light
head
that
falls
to
a
patchy
film
over
top
light
does
not
penetrate
this
one
at
all
nose
is
very
roasty
almost
ashy
with
a
solid
dark
fruity
sweetness
and
coffee
undertones
it
seems
a
little
distant
id
really
like
it
to
be
stronger
in
the
aroma
flavor
is
anything
from
distant
initially
im
hit
with
flavors
of
deep
roast
and
dark
fruit
that
fades
quickly
into
a
coffee
bitterness
that
is
accentuated
by
a
very
nice
and
clean
bitterness
from
the
hopping
the
hop
bitterness
really
hangs
well
into
the
finish
as
well
i
like
the
interplay
of
roast
and
hop
feel
is
thick
with
a
light
carbonation
its
not
syrupy
at
all
really
making
this
one
work
well
on
my
tongue
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
big
stout
i
like
that
the
flavors
come
together
to
a
nice
combination
of
sweet
and
malty
and
roasty
and
hoppy
alcohol
is
not
obtrusive
this
one
is
deceptively
drinkable
and
would
get
me
in
trouble
if
it
were
on
the
shelves
around
me
very
excellent
beer
overall
impression
a
fine
stout
for
sure
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
if
available
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
due
to
the
astringency
perhaps
the
grains
were
oversparged
still
a
solid
offering
thanks
malty
drinkability
is
definitely
the
weak
point
of
this
beer
but
it
is
still
good
just
not
something
i
could
drink
more
than
one
of
in
a
row
menacing
dark
black
color
with
an
equally
dark
tan
colored
head
half
inch
thick
head
fades
quickly
leaving
very
little
lacing
delicious
aroma
lots
of
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
hints
of
dark
fruits
and
coffee
in
the
background
the
smell
reminds
me
of
melted
hersheys
special
dark
chocolate
bars
full
bodies
taste
roasted
malt
and
bitter
dark
chocolate
quite
bitter
smooth
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
and
leaves
a
definite
dry
feeling
in
the
mouth
i
never
would
have
known
this
had
a
abv
of
8
very
easy
too
drink
another
great
offering
from
dark
horse
deep
opaque
black
body
with
a
very
large
head
more
in
the
realm
of
a
brown
rather
than
tan
in
color
perfect
appearence
deeply
roasted
nose
with
hints
of
coffee
mainly
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
blackberries
taste
follows
suit
with
an
explosion
of
roasted
grains
chocolate
coffee
fruits
and
a
mild
hop
bitterness
a
tasty
one
for
sure
notes
this
beer
is
great
i
love
the
flavors
the
balance
and
the
body
is
super
i
wish
i
could
buy
this
one
at
my
local
store
this
black
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
ipas
damn
this
poured
like
an
impy
aroma
is
roasted
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
deep
black
with
a
thin
mocha
head
fore
is
very
bitter
with
lots
of
coffee
notes
hints
of
sweet
cream
in
the
middle
along
with
quality
milk
chocolate
and
malt
the
finish
is
again
bitter
with
a
big
coffee
finish
intense
flavor
in
this
porter
that
could
easily
pass
as
a
stout
oh
my
the
aftertaste
on
this
beer
is
devilish
i
cant
help
but
drink
it
i
cant
stop
thinking
about
driving
to
michigan
to
get
more
as
beefy
as
this
beer
is
there
are
certain
aspects
that
hid
that
fact
very
well
i
could
drink
this
all
night
how
long
that
night
would
be
is
another
question
all
to
itself
delicious
complex
relaxing
i
really
love
this
beer
thank
you
redhaze
for
the
bottle
this
was
a
great
surprise
recommended
taste
is
well
blended
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
vinous
fruits
stand
out
the
mouthfeel
is
unique
i
think
the
body
is
thinner
than
one
might
expect
yet
it
feels
grainy
on
my
tongue
tannic
and
coating
this
shows
no
sign
of
8abv
drink
up
mouthfeel
is
chewy
creamy
smooth
sugary
and
bittersweet
along
the
palate
another
winner
from
dark
horse
i
am
quite
jealous
i
cannot
obtain
more
of
this
gem
trade
anyone
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
nice
complex
but
exceedingly
tolarable
flavor
sippable
yes
but
also
smooth
enough
to
drink
several
impressive
full
mouth
that
as
mentioned
above
has
some
residual
oil
but
the
lingering
hops
seem
to
balance
it
out
in
the
finish
i
could
drink
two
maybe
three
of
these
before
calling
it
a
night
or
at
least
switching
to
something
with
a
lower
abv
i
could
drink
plenty
more
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
sized
tan
head
that
recedes
quickly
and
leaves
a
good
sheet
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
nice
espresso
and
chocolate
aroma
from
the
chocolate
malt
it
has
just
a
hint
a
citrus
from
the
hops
but
its
not
overpowering
bang
a
lot
more
espresso
in
the
flavor
it
really
comes
across
strong
the
chocolate
is
there
but
is
a
bit
more
subtle
the
hops
almost
disappear
and
are
just
there
to
balance
the
flavor
a
bit
full
rich
mouth
feel
and
a
nice
drinakbility
this
is
another
nice
beer
from
this
brewery
ive
been
impressed
with
their
stouts
mouthfeel
is
big
with
a
nice
creaminess
and
ample
carbonation
the
carbonation
helps
cut
through
this
one
making
it
more
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
stout
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
around
goes
down
quite
easily
and
i
would
love
to
have
a
few
on
a
cold
night
dark
horse
continues
to
impress
thanks
to
cornboy
for
the
opportunity
my
first
beer
from
dark
horse
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
in
my
fridge
what
a
fine
brew
drinkability
and
notes

for
a
big
stout
this
beer
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
the
dryness
keeps
the
beer
from
getting
cloying
or
unpleasant
however
with
so
many
great
big
available
american
stouts
out
there
this
one
just
doesnt
do
anything
to
make
itself
memorable
d
a
double
stout
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
im
not
sure
it
the
malt
taste
and
texture
would
live
up
to
the
name
double
stout
it
does
have
interesting
hop
notes
which
you
rarely
see
in
stouts
even
american
stouts
with
more
complexity
in
the
roasted
and
some
toasted
grain
this
has
great
potential
once
again
thanks
to
tikkigodxxx
for
the
great
beer
trade
you
folk
in
the
midwest
have
some
mighty
fine
brews
absolutely
impenetrable
onyx
fantastic
multilayed
chocolate
milk
lace
pattern
slight
licorise
on
the
nose
seems
out
of
place
and
funky
but
then
the
flavor
reassures
you
that
this
is
fact
one
killer
beer
anise
soured
milk
roastiness
is
all
over
the
place
but
kept
in
check
with
sweetly
almost
russian
imperial
characteristics
hoppy
and
bitter
as
all
hell
remains
potent
and
in
your
face
while
remaining
amazingly
drinkable
damned
good
from
the
source
but
equally
good
from
the
bottle

a
remarkable
achievement
scarily
similar
to
a
smaller
version
of
rogues
imperial
stout
the
title
black
bier
ale
let
me
to
expect
something
i
might
almost
be
able
to
see
some
light
through
but
this
one
is
indeed
black
the
head
is
small
but
persistent
the
nose
buckwheat
honey
dark
coffee
malt
and
brown
sugar
the
palate
dry
bitterness
the
dark
coffee
predominates
but
there
is
an
unmistakable
bitter
note
that
reminds
me
of
campari
i
am
also
reminded
of
a
slightly
burnt
marshmallow
a
big
beer
with
a
long
dignified
finish
there
is
just
a
bit
of
chalkiness
that
mars
the
mouthfeel
however
overall
though
i
consider
it
a
very
good
beer
this
batch
is
wellcarbonated
and
the
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
for
its
strength
a
fine
beer
for
a
session
or
a
meal
the
taste
certainly
gets
way
mo
better
with
temperature
elevation
i
was
not
vibing
with
this
dark
skinned
beauty
when
we
first
met
plan
b
let
her
catch
some
heat
result
nice
different
that
is
undeniable
stout
doused
with
india
pale
ale
style
hopping
the
dryest
finishing
stout
beer
i
have
met
in
my
short
tenure
as
a
guy
who
fancies
himself
a
beer
drinker
and
aspiring
champion
of
beer
stock
stout
flavors
of
coffee
and
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
challenged
by
hop
bitters
weird
yet
foreseeable
good
shiznit
this
is
my
second
dark
horse
sample
both
times
the
stuff
has
improved
down
the
stretch
watch
the
temperature
i
guess
so
far
this
brewer
has
made
me
appreciate
the
natural
rawness
of
their
styles
realness
purity
no
selling
out
by
dark
horse
it
beersonifies
what
being
an
individual
is
all
about
ok
i
was
expecting
something
not
like
this
a
double
stout
at
8
abv
not
the
ideal
predinner
beer
but
its
open
so
here
we
go
the
first
shock
was
the
appearance
of
what
looked
like
motor
oil
pouring
out
of
the
bottle
into
my
borrowed
glass
just
a
hint
of
mahogany
highlighted
the
edges
and
a
nice
tan
head
topped
the
beer
and
lingered
for
a
while
the
aroma
was
great
with
dark
fruits
roasted
malts
and
a
it
of
herbalness
i
typically
discuss
flavor
before
mouthfeel
but
this
one
the
latter
demands
attention
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
big
stout
silky
smooth
coolly
enveloping
the
tongue
with
the
carbonation
lifting
the
beer
off
the
tongue
on
the
finish
best
part
theres
not
a
strong
lingering
sweetness
that
usually
accompanies
such
a
great
mouthfeel
the
flavor
does
have
a
strong
black
malt
presence
and
just
a
hint
of
caramel
sweetness
up
front
strong
dark
chocolate
flavors
develop
along
with
a
touch
of
minty
hop
herbalness
man
this
stuff
is
great
i
think
this
was
about
8
a
six
pack
i
may
have
to
go
get
more
before
i
go
home
while
a
strong
beer
with
respect
to
both
flavor
and
abv
i
could
drink
a
good
bit
of
this
stuff
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
make
the
effort
of
tracking
down
regional
stuff
worthwhile
also
makes
sitting
in
a
hotel
room
easier
as
well
do
yourself
a
favor
and
give
this
one
a
try
all
too
frequently
special
beers
arent
that
special
this
one
is
very
special
nice
wow
this
is
sooo
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
i
had
no
idea
what
i
was
in
for
this
one
poured
out
like
an
imperial
stout
pitch
brown
with
a
thick
caramelly
creamy
brown
head
that
reduced
quickly
to
a
bit
of
a
dusting
and
a
thick
ring
huge
aroma
total
shocker
here
too
scents
of
lambic
rich
imperial
stout
alcohol
with
tons
of
hoppiness
merlot
chocolate
coffee
deep
and
roasty
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
a
bitey
carbination
that
snaps
at
you
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
nice
toasty
dark
hoppiness
with
a
good
bite
blackened
toast
dark
bittersweet
chocolate
and
espresso
this
is
damn
luscious
great
flavors
and
feel
nice
one
the
beer
smells
strongly
of
smoke
milk
and
burnt
sugar
the
initial
taste
is
a
sharp
bitterness
which
seems
like
its
from
the
dark
malts
the
bitterness
is
reminiscent
of
a
very
dark
chocolate
subsequent
sips
reveal
a
smoother
more
balanced
aspect
to
this
beer
as
it
warms
up
as
it
warms
up
more
a
lot
more
chocolate
comes
out
in
the
flavor
be
careful
of
drinking
this
beer
too
cold
its
not
good
very
astringent
and
bitter
drinkability
is
high
ignored
this
beer
in
my
locals
too
long
very
solid
effort
from
the
folks
in
marshall
778
what
a
surprise
when
the
label
says
ale
on
it
thats
is
what
i
thought
i
was
getting
glad
i
got
a
porter
poured
dark
brown
with
a
deep
tan
frothy
head
good
lacing
aroma
was
carmel
chocolatedark
fruitsfinish
a
nice
bitterness
with
hints
a
sweetness
glad
i
had
to
buy
a
6
pack
of
this
and
not
just
1
bottle
which
i
like
to
do
when
i
am
trying
out
a
new
beer
starts
with
large
roasted
malts
balanced
with
the
ample
limelike
citrus
hops
then
the
middle
settles
on
the
toungue
and
departs
a
layered
impression
chicory
medira
molasses
nuts
all
over
seen
with
the
lime
hops
the
finish
is
long
with
the
chicory
molasses
tastes
giving
way
to
the
increased
bittering
finally
a
deep
metallic
aftertaste
and
a
slow
warming
the
alcohol
is
well
buried
in
this
rich
brew
wadda
stout
recommended
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
another
however
given
the
topnotch
reviews
for
this
and
the
other
brewerys
selections
i
may
try
more
from
the
brewer
if
i
can
find
them
huge
head
poured
semihard
into
a
duvel
glass
convex
atop
with
good
duration
and
excellent
lacing
seemed
rather
thick
at
first
sight
and
right
then
and
there
i
knew
i
had
a
true
micro
or
glorified
homebrewer
as
we
sometimes
like
to
say
the
aroma
is
amazing
and
no
matter
what
they
wanna
call
this
double
schwarzbier
triple
sweet
stout
etc
its
a
super
rich
and
malty
dark
beast
and
the
alcohol
is
barely
discernable
on
both
the
nose
and
palate
creamy
mouthfeel
thinner
than
expected
with
plenty
of
citrusy
aromatic
hops
bittering
hops
and
roasted
malts
all
fighting
for
attention
like
paparazzi
jockeying
for
a
good
photo
op
lingering
pronounced
bitterness
is
not
probably
to
everyones
liking
but
it
is
to
mine
notes
of
bitter
chocolate
sour
apple
and
burnt
toast
theres
a
lactic
quality
here
that
works
out
well
making
for
a
more
complex
brew
than
one
might
expect
from
what
at
first
glance
seems
like
such
a
malt
monster
so
rather
than
be
cloyingly
sweet
its
well
balanced
double
stout
huh
not
something
thats
done
too
often
and
one
bottle
is
probably
more
than
enough
bitter
darkness
to
satisfy
a
couple
of
guiness
draught
enthusiasts
as
its
altogether
a
bit
more
challenging
than
most
of
the
stouts
youll
find
nice
dry
finish
too
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
12
oz
bottle
and
immediately
i
noticed
its
intense
black
color
flowing
from
the
bottle
it
looked
like
used
motor
oil
it
is
opaque
and
dark
which
makes
it
very
nice
to
look
at
it
has
a
fizzy
tan
head
that
thins
out
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
definately
roasty
but
has
a
distinct
alcohol
scent
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
dark
maltiness
with
a
sour
earthy
taste
some
cherry
and
more
distinct
alcohol
warmth
the
downfall
of
this
beer
i
think
is
that
it
really
only
presents
a
dark
malt
flavor
without
much
complexity
in
the
flavor
it
certainly
looks
great
but
the
flavor
falls
a
bit
short
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
would
definately
buy
this
one
again
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
could
make
a
night
out
of
another
beer
tasted
at
the
michigan
brewers
festival
opaque
black
in
color
with
a
decent
brown
head
the
aroma
is
all
roasted
malt
and
some
sweetness
flavor
follows
suit
this
beer
is
sweet
and
thick
like
a
big
boned
chocolate
porter
much
thicker
and
roastier
than
i
expected
this
is
a
good
beer
well
who
gives
a
crap
this
is
damned
good
and
that
is
all
that
the
people
need
to
know
received
this
bottle
as
part
of
bif

from
deejaydan

the

odd

really
dark
brown
almost
but
not
quite
black
one
of
the
darkest
stouts
ive
seen
the
head
is
not
large
but
is
an
interesting
rich
brown
color
maybe
a
bit
reddish
and
is
dense
and
foamy
with
decent
retention
some
lace
tries
to
cling
to
the
glass
but
slides
back
down
smell
is
darkroasted
malts
and
maybe
a
little
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
more
complex
than
expected
roasted
malt
bitterness
or
is
that
the
hops
notes
of
chocolate
and
coffee
as
noted
in
the
smell
but
also
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
maybe
a
little
licorice
in
the
aftertaste
very
dry
finish
with
some
astringency
alcohol
while
initially
well
hidden
comes
out

as

pretty
drinkable
for

liked

one
pretty
well
and
would

drink
it
again
given
the
opportunity
good

comments

a
big
thanks
to
garthwaite
for
sending
me
this
offering
from
dark
horse
a
wonderful
brew
dont
let
the
black
bier
title
fool
you
this
is
a
double
stout
intense
chewy
rich
and
full
of
complementary
flavors
i
would
have
liked
this
more
with
a
smidge
less
flavor
hops
and
a
more
velvety
mouthfeel
but
it
still
stands
as
an
awesome
brew
considering
its
dense
body
and
abv
this
one
is
dangerously
drinkable
i
already
drank
half
a
bottle
without
batting
an
eye
highly
recommended
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
2
of
medium
brown
head
over
the
opaque
black
brew
long
lasting
head
laces
well
aroma
is
strongly
of
dark
malts
but
tempered
with
a
bit
of
sweet
creaminess
taste
is
dominated
by
dark
malts
and
their
inherent
bitterness
but
closes
out
with
a
nice
little
hoppy
bite
mouthfeel
is
good
and
smooth
albeit
quashed
a
bit
by
the
dark
malt
bitterness
and
drinkabilty
is
good
as
well
good
stuff
although
i
will
admit
i
was
fooled
by
the
vague
label
as
well
and
was
expecting
a
schwarz
or
black
lager
nice
surprise
sampled
on
tap
at
the
brewery
then
again
from
a
64
oz
growler
upon
my
return
home
pours
black
which
i
guess
is
to
be
expected
given
the
name
dark
tan
creamy
head
that
laced
nicely
powerful
aroma
of
blackberries
blueberries
deeply
roasted
malts
mild
chocolate
some
earthy
hops
bitter
front
end
with
massive
roastiness
the
blackberry
flavor
to
back
up
the
aroma
some
chocolate
caramel
notes
as
well
as
peppery
hops
make
this
a
complex
unique
brew
not
sure
what
style
this
fits
in
schwarzbier
porter
stout
double
stout
doesnt
seem
like
it
fits
perfectly
into
any
of
them
what
i
do
know
is
that
this
brew
is
no
joke
it
is
heavily
roasted
assertively
bitter
and
damn
good
another
fine
treat
i
can
thank
trbeer
for
tan
head
swiftly
recedes
o
a
ring
over
this
opaque
black
impressing
hue
powerful
and
appealing
aroma
impressively
well
blended
and
balanced
wait
this
is
8
smokey
roasted
maple
and
gentle
chops
grapefruity
and
lemony
hit
the
nose
together
with
molasses
and
licorice
nothing
overdone
nonetheless
no
flavor
is
shy
dark
malt
comes
out
in
a
graham
cookies
and
dark
chocolate
manner
chops
are
just
expressive
enough
to
keep
the
focus
and
the
malt
interplay
great
mouthfeel
with
comfortable
carbonation
as
smooth
as
any
oatmeal
stout
this
is
great
psychprof
a
supreme
stout
exceeding
the
lineup
of
rogues
looks
like
yummy
chocolate
drink
stout
roasted
with
chocolate
aroma
creamy
mouthfeel
with
roast
more
so
than
coffee
which
works
for
me
enough
of
a
drink
experience
that
you
dont
know
the
alcohol
until
klunk
glad
i
bought
a
sixpack
dry
mouth
aftertaste
nearly
black
with
a
thin
ring
of
tan
head
aroma
is
hoppy
and
piney
but
not
very
assertive
flavor
is
quite
bitter
without
much
malt
sweetness
coffee
and
hop
bitterness
really
overpower
everything
else
slick
oily
mouthfeel
but
seems
a
bit
weak
bodied
for
the
flavor
marginal
drinkability
hmmm
whats
this
now
another
awesome
michigan
beer
this
brew
pours
out
an
opaque
black
colour
with
a
thick
tan
head
that
lasts
the
aromas
are
all
coffee
chocolate
caramel
deep
roasted
malts
and
slight
booze
the
taste
follows
suit
with
tons
of
coffee
flavors
and
a
lovely
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
that
than
envelopes
your
tongue
in
dark
70cocoa
belgian
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
soooo
creamy
and
the
drinkability
is
damn
good
as
well
oh
yeah
there
is
also
a
nice
freshly
citirc
hop
flavor
in
this
one
as
well
very
good
yet
another
beauty
i
can
thank
marburg
for
a
nice
tasting
beer
but
a
bit
bitter
for
my
taste
i
would
have
a
hard
time
drinking
a
bunch
of
these
thanks
to
trbeer
for
the
bottle
wow
a
nice
imperial
stout
character
in
a
beer
that
doesnt
seem
too
big
hopefully
one
ill
have
again
this
summer
in
michigan
this
one
poured
extremely
dark
and
decently
thick
but
the
head
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
even
though
i
did
an
extremely
hard
pour
slight
lacing
but
even
that
was
weak
taste
was
strong
and
malty
lots
of
astringent
flavors
chalky
texture
to
it
thick
molasses
taste
is
dominant
other
dark
flavors
emerge
but
no
chocolate
or
coffee
which
i
usually
taste
this
one
gets
better
the
further
i
go
along
but
it
seems
too
one
sided
and
rough
for
my
liking
it
pours
very
thickly
the
head
is
very
thin
and
brown
colored
the
flavors
are
roasty
with
a
hint
of
hops
its
nice
tasting
not
what
i
was
expecting
when
i
ordered
a
black
beer
this
has
imperial
stout
all
over
it
in
the
appearance
aroma
and
flavor
an
intense
black
hole
for
light
that
continues
to
be
a
visual
void
with
its
obsidian
opacity
sweet
and
roasty
nose
very
big
stout
like
character
deeply
bitter
flavors
pure
bitter
chocolate
roasted
grains
coffee
beans
toffee
culminates
with
a
big
bitter
finish
that
likes
to
hang
out
like
a
fun
but
slightly
unwanted
guest
a
hell
of
a
beer
i
just
wonder
why
they
dont
call
it
special
reserve
stout
or
something
thanks
to
trbeer
delicious
this
pours
out
black
in
the
glass
with
an
aroma
of
chocolate
lightly
of
black
licorice
and
coffee
the
taste
is
complex
with
roasted
burnt
malt
chocolate
and
coffee
a
nice
dose
of
hops
on
the
finish
this
seemed
more
like
a
stout
than
a
swartzbier
but
hey
its
a
highly
drinkable
beer
whatever
the
style
may
be
foamy
head
of
fat
ass
bubbles
over
pitch
nose
of
chocolate
butter
creme
roasted
walnuts
and
a
hard

weed

an
amiable
roastiness
hits
the
buds
straight
off
to
meld
seamlessly
into
a
long
but
mildmannered
hop
bitterness
that
necessitates
another

also
there
was

this
a

my
favorite
aspect
of
this
beer
was
a
very
mellow
carcoal
flavor
like
one
would
get
if
the
beer
were

starts
with
a
light
berrylike
apple
fruitiness
becomes
more
caramelish
and
creamy
as
it
warms
with
hints
of
floral
hop
flavor
and
then
unleashes
an
avalanche
of
bold
deeplyroasted
coffee
and
bitterness
into
the
dry
finish
the
bitterness
lingers
alongside
short
flashes
of
sweet
caramel
and
deep
roast
although
this
beer
is
listed
here
as
a
germanstyle
schwarzbier
it
is
certainly
not
its
much
too
over
the
top
for
that
and
yet
its
very
nicely
balanced
allowing
the
sweet
caramel
maltiness
to
show
amongst
a
very
deep
roast
burnt
character
and
some
intense
bitterness
rich
and
exciting
easy
to
indulge
in
this
elixer
the
beer
pours
darker
than
the
inside
of
a
cow
head
is
colossal
creamy
the
lace
sticky
thick
sheets
that
cling
mightily
to
the
glass
both
are
a
nice
chocolate
color
nose
is
coffee
like
roasted
grains
caramel
with
hints
of
malt
very
sniffable
the
start
is
malt
and
somewhat
sweet
the
top
is
bulky
the
finish
is
ponderously
hopped
scantily
carbonated
the
aftertaste
quite
dry
and
long
lasting
very
quaffable
beer
and
a
nice
way
to
start
the
weekend
also
well
worth
your
trying
this
medium
bodied
german
black
bier
is
so
thick
and
dark
light
cant
even
escape
it
has
a
strong
roasted
berry
aroma
and
the
complex
flavor
includes
roasted
malt
and
cloves
the
initial
tastes
do
not
include
much
of
a
hop
presence
but
there
is
a
nice
lingering
light
bitterness
with
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
theres
actually
a
lot
of
citrusy
hops
for
a
porter
since
the
darker
maltier
beers
tend
to
just
eat
the
hop
flavors
and
you
can
really
pick
them
up
in
this
beer
on
the
appearance
it
really
comes
closer
to
a
stout
than
a
porter
but
the
flavor
and
aroma
really
fit
in
with
the
porter
style
this
beer
gives
me
the
impression
that
this
brewery
could
really
do
some
good
stuff
black
in
color
but
still
somewhat
penetrable
to
light
an
inch
of
tightly
knit
foam
comprised
of
tiny
bubbles
is
resting
on
top
heavy
lacing
is
present
amazing
aroma
of
citrus
hops
greets
the
nose
theres
undercurrent
of
dark
malt
the
taste
is
of
bitter
piney
hops
on
the
front
of
the
palate
the
back
of
the
palate
is
dark
malt
it
finishes
with
a
bitter
flourish
of
more
piney
hops
the
mouth
is
initially
creamy
and
then
very
dry
and
lightly
sticky
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
why
is
this
being
discontinued
again
strong
and
malty
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
a
pretty
heavy
beer
stone
is
a
popular
brewery
but
ive
yet
to
have
a
beer
i
can
enjoy
from
them
this
one
definitely
taste
different
than
any
black
ipa
ive
had
too
bitter
for
my
taste
the
speakeasy
butchertown
black
ipa
blows
this
one
away
get
that
instead
if
you
can
find
it
nice
roasted
taste
with
a
hoppy
dry
finish
one
last
go
around
before
this
gets
retired
cant
believe
they
wont
be
making
this
anymore
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
perfect
balance
of
roasted
malt
and
big
ibus
tears
in
my
eyes
a
fantastic
beer
very
dark
and
strong
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
are
present
alcohol
has
pletty
of
taste
here
almost
like
a
guinness
on
steroids
two
thumbs
way
up
overall
although
there
is
a
nice
rare
balance
of
citrus
and
roasted
malts
in
the
taste
not
quite
feeling
this
one
as
much
as
i
had
hoped
had
a
ruination
last
night
and
preferred
it
quite
a
bit
more
as
previously
stated
i
think
the
complexity
of
flavors
actually
played
against
it
still
a
very
good
beer
just
a
bit
disappointed
definitely
an
experience
ill
buy
a
6pk
of
this
and
drink
an
occasional
one
here
and
there
too
rich
to
drink
23
but
still
exquisite
enough
to
appreciate
from
time
to
time
amazing
beer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
drank
to
date
so
complex
with
the
flavors
that
pair
so
well
together
bomber
poured
into
a
plastic
cup
appearance
is
nearly
opaque

topped
with

that
has

but
wont
stick
to

sweetness

another
clearcut
winner
from
stone
impressed
by
the
old
school
malt
emphasis
here
considering
these
guys
rep
for
hopforward
brews
they
got
this
base
covered
as
well
of
course
very
solid
if
i
wanted
an
ipa
this
would
be
one
i
would
come
back
to
regularly
stone
has
yet
to
disappoint
o
havent
had
this
one
in
a
while
and
im
now
wondering
why
it
isnt
a
regular
outstanding
black
ipa
im
gonna
miss
this
one
when
they
retire
it
o
i
liked
the
hop
flavors
but
thought
the
toasted
malt
could
have
came
through
more
it
was
a
little
unbalanced
on
the
hoppy
side
great
black
i
p
a
its
the
hoppiest
of
all
the
black
ipas
ive
had
and
the
black
malt
sweetness
brings
it
all
home
to
the
most
unique
flavored
black
ipa
ive
had
it
might
best
too
sweet
for
some
hopheads
but
its
so
hoppy
it
just
doesnt
matter
this
is
what
a
black
ipa
should
be
the
only
competition
is
has
is
something
lagunitas
did
and
i
canremember
what
its
called
bring
on
the
5s
moderate
hop
aroma
with
a
resiny
grapefruity

nonalcohol
very
fun
and
would
love
to
have
this
by
a
fireplace
this
could
be
the
perfect
dark
double
ipa
just
a
few
shortcomings
like
the
head
is
too
thin
and
the
body
is
a
bit
too
thick
and
a
little
smokiness
or
wood
flavors
would
be
welcome
additions
really
good

is
of
a
very
nice
black
ipa
rich
and
true
to
form
with
a
pleasant
balance
that
leans
towards
hops
but
lets
enough
roasted

through

overall
impression

flavor
is
of
a
very
nice
very
bold
black
ipa
it
is
very
hop
forward
and
bold
but
still
quite
nice
and
with
enough
malt
to
balance
mouthfeel
is
mediumfull
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
sticky
feel
overall
impression
of
mouthfeel
is
of
a
nice
black
ipa
like
many
i
have
had
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
it
has
a
good
aroma
and
flavor
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
that
aids
the
flavor
profile
not
as
good
as
the
gold
standard
wookey
jack
but
still
quite
nice
and
a
shame
its
being
discontinued
good
black
ipa
i
just
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
malt
presence
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
doesnt
really
offer
anything
special
relative
to
stones
other
ipas
very
good
black
ipa
by
stone
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
it

flows
well

very
tasty
had
this
poured

into

color
was
the
same
as
every

youve

tried
the

was
slightly

harsh
than
most
though
one
of
the
better
qualities
of
the
beer
the
taste
wasnt
as
much
black

ipa
as
id
hoped
more
alcohol
and
less
malt
hops
or
smoke
than
youd
want
it
was
good
just
a
bit
disappointing
given
all
of
heard
o
a
well
crafted
black
ipa
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
in
the
same
league
as
dubhenighttimewookey
jack
perfect
for
the
hop
head
looking
to
transition
into
porters
or
the
opposite
way
around
decided
to
purchase
wondering
what
the
hell
a
black
ipa
is
months
back
and
trusting
stones
judgment
pre
beer
advocate
first
opened
hmm
smells
like
a
porter
stout
but
whats
that
end
note
im
gonna
go
for
a
sip
wow
this
is
delicious
starts
off
like
a
porter
stout
ends
like
an
ipa
i
cant
explain
it
ive
actually
looked
at
the
low
reviews
on
this
one
and
they
exist
i
know
everyones
taste
differs
but
i
feel
like
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
beers
ever
if
i
had
enough
to
spend
12
on
a
couple
4
packs
a
week
i
would
but
rather
keep
it
special
and
get
every
so
often
hands
down
best
12oz
bottled
beer
so
far
in
my
journey
though
craft
beer
if
you
like
ipas
and
dont
mind
porters
stouts
try
this
just
make
sure
you
get
it
fresh
and
check
the
dates
although
it
is
understandable
living
on
opposite
coast
these
days
thank
you
stone
please
dont
stop
brewing
this
ever
cheers
kevin
o
sometimes
black
ipas
just
dont
jive
with
me
because
the
balance
just
seems
to
be
off
this
one
worked
very
well
just
a
really
good
mix
of
ipa
and
dark
malt
characteristics
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
in
the
bottle
for
me
it
had
a
strong
aroma
of
urine
that
really
lessened
the
drinking
experience
however
on
tap
this
aroma
was
not
present
making
it
a
very
nice
beer
on
tap
final
score
4
22
delicious
and
smooth
it
smells
like
chocolatey
roasty
goodness
with
some
mocha
i
wish
i
could
wear
this
as
perfume
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
plus
great
hoppy
flavor
and
bitterness
this
is
a
wonderful
good
looking
brew
that
i
could
drink
every
day
if
not
for
the
price
havent
seen
this
bomber
under
10
dollars
around
here
my
only
complaint
is
the
slight
aftertaste
its
a
bit
astringent
and
aspirin
like
more
so
than
other
ipasapas
ive
had
still
pretty
amazing
this
pours
a
very
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
foamy
light
brown
head
the
aroma
is
rich
and
hoppy
the
flavor
is
rich
and
bold
with
deep
robust
tone
but
still
very
hoppy
this
finishes
with
an
oak
after
taste
and
leaves
a
lingering
bitterness
very
well
made
for
the
style
pours
like
a
thin
darkness
a
little
licorice
on
the
front
end
reminds
me
a
big
kid
candy
thumbs
up
deep
complex
and
intricate
flavors
abound
to
bring
out
some
of
the
complexities
in
an
enticing
manner
and
to
truly
savor
the
finish
this
beer
offers
enjoy
with
a
cigar
overall
i
wont
i
wasnt
too
happy
with
the
beer
i
wont
ever
buy
it
again
nor
will
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
interested
in
trying
a
bipa
spent
9
99
on
a
bomber
and
drank
maybe
4
ounces
of
it
before
i
dumped
it
all
serving
type
bottle
pours
a
pitch
black
color
thats
actually
a
little
thinner
looking
than
i
am
used
to
it
has
a
big
3
finger
brown
head
that
lingers
for
a
bit
before
lacing
the
hell
out
of
my
snifter
first
smell
is
fairly
hoppy
pine
notes
mostly
there
are
some
muted
roasty
notes
in
the
background
its
pretty
muted
first
sip
is
quite
similar
to
the
nose
piney
hops
roasted
malt
some
subtle
coffee
notes
in
the
background
a
little
char
bitterness
finished
the
brew
off
there
is
a
pretty
clean
finish
with
a
low
bitterness
its
very
drinkable
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
not
one
id
seek
out
again
but
thats
moreso
the
fact
i
dont
love
the
style
bang
love
it
black
ipa
drinks
like
a
stout
piney
hops
with
roasted
malts
smooth
with
a
hidden
bite
back
that
is
darn
near
unnoticeable
almost
chewy
if
an
ipa
could
be
called
chewy
subtle
hints
of
citrus
fruit
12
oz
bottle
subtle
hops
very
drinkable
and
delicious
o
as
good
as
it
is
i
remember
it
having
more
hops
in
the
taste
and
i
miss
that
dark
sweet
vanilla
notes
chocolate
flavor
spices
chicory
balanced
and
smooth
with
a
somewhat
peaty
and
toasted
malt
finish
that
reminds
one
of
a
hearty
stout
8
610
not
spectacular
and
doesnt
remind
one
of
an
ipa
where
are
the
hops
overall
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
of
beer
definitely
in
the
top
tier
if
you
think
you
would
like
to
try
a
variety
of
black
ipas
dont
try
this
one
first
it
will
ruin
the
genre
because
you
wont
find
another
like
it
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beers
ive
ever
had
bitter
and
did
not
enjoy
the
flavor
overall
i
like
this
style
of
beer
its
not
better
than
any
of
the
other
ones
i
have
had
but
its
not
really
worse
they
all
are
around
the
same
in
quality
at
least
the
ones
that
i
have
tried
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
i
have
a
4
pack
of
founders
dark
penance
i
am
looking
forward
to
trying
i
am
interested
in
seeing
how
this
compares

really

digging

overall
great
beer
smooth
delicious
ton
of
hops
o
though
i
feel
like
this
beer
is
better
realized
and
a
bit
smoother
on
draft
the
bottled
version
certainly
does
it
justice
an
unforgiving

the
benchmarks
my

one

tried
this

my
favorite

creations
the
creativity
of
balancing
roasted

goodness
and
hops
that
complement
these

produces
amazing
beers
stones
black

is
a
great
example
of
a
complex
amazing
beer
the
taste
is
well
balanced
of
malt
sweetness
and
hop
bitterness
with
an
acidic
middle
taste
of
mild
balsamic
vinegar
very
good
but
be
warned
very
strong
and
in
your
face
one
of
the
stronger
black
ipa
beers
ive
ever
had
but
outstanding
o
i
expected
a
lot
more
roasted
malt
and
bitterness
considering
the
style
but
it
was
a
great
beer
nonetheless
im
thinking
that
the
bottle
i
had
was
past
its
prime
as
far
as
intense
hoppiness
but
for
some
reason
a
lot
of
great
hop
flavors
stuck
around
flavor
profile
reminded
me
of
terrys
chocolate
orange
muddy
brown
color
not
flat
astonishingly
pours
black
with
some
deep
amber
highlights
one
inch
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
quite
well
definite
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
slight
citrus
and
roasted
coffee
taste
has
a
pretty
strong
vanilla
component
blending
nicely
with
pine
and
citrus
hop
great
black
ipa
its
nice
to
see
this
style
picking
up
some
momentum
very
tasty
hoppy
front
with
strong
backbone
great
balance
no
overt
alcohol
taste
even
tho
its
8
70
abv
came
in
a
very
reasonably
priced
variety
case
way
here
on
the
east
coast
happy
with
this
one
really
enjoyable
black
ipa
sets
the
bar
high
for
others
i
am
not
an
ipa
fan
by
nature
i
gravitate
towards
the
dark
side
this
is
the
skywalker
of
ipas
bringing
the
malty
darkness
akin
to
a
sith
lord
with
the
tremendous
zest
of
a
good
jedi
ipa
ok
done
with
the
starwars
analogies
a
very
good
ipa
for
us
stout
fans
first
ba
review
in
a
few
years
dark
ruby
when
held
to
the
light
with
big
sheets
of
thick
lacing
great
aromas
from
this
one
malty
and
dark
roasted
notes
slightly
sweet
and
subtle
vanilla
soft
on
the
pallet
with
a
nice
hop
texture
finishing
with
a
lasting
dryness
till
the
next
sip
very
balanced
bipa
lending
itself
to
the
the
hoppy
side
of
the
range
the
strong
abv
is
controlled
and
not
overpowering
but
shows
on
the
finish
i
really
like
this
offering
from
stone
and
see
it
as
one
to
judge
others
overall
excellent
black
ipa
a
real
treat
for
hopheads
i
really
am
not
a
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
it
seems
the
appearance
was
nice
being
very
dark
brown
and
a
tan
head
that
lasts
a
bit
the
smell
is
full
of
hops
but
not
much
else
it
would
seem
the
taste
though
was
very
different
starting
out
with
a
lot
of
floral
notes
in
the
beginning
gave
way
to
a
semi
sweet
malt
finish
that
i
found
very
refreshing
would
highly
recommend
amazing
beer
starts
more
amazing
than
it
finishes
compares
well
with
arrogant
bastard
which
stands
as
an
alltime
fave
i
personally
do
not
really
understand
black
alesipas
seems
to
me
there
are
always
much
better
options
on
either
the
ipa
or
stout
side
this
one
seems
to
favor
the
stout
side
taste
seem
to
improve
as
the
ale
warmed
up
toward
room
temperature
overall
an
enjoyable
drink
this
has
to
be
the
best
black
ipa
on
the
planet
great
dark
appearance
the
smell
of
roasted
malts
is
phenomenal
characteristically
over
hopped
like
many
stone
beers
but
the
taste
is
a
perfect
blend
of
malt
and
hops
this
could
be
my
favorite
stone
beer
and
they
have
a
lot
of
great
ones
overall
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
as
a
case
or
a
6
pack
it
was
fine
for
a
variety
pack
too
much
bitter
after
taste
and
not
enough
flavor
and
poor
mouthfeel
o
do
you
ever
find
yourself
getting
mad
at
just
how
good
stone
is
at
making
beer
because
that
was
my
emotion
while
drinking
this
im
waiting
for
the
day
when
i
find
a
bad
stone
brew
but
that
day
is
not
today
ssr
black
ipa
is
just
another
example
of
why
stone
remains
one
of
the
big
names
in
the
game
this
beer
is
sure
to
please
hopheads
and
stout
drinkers
alike
and
provides
a
unique
flavor
profile
that
is
sure
to
please
anyone
into
unique
brews
o
very
good
black
ipa
a
lot
more
dank
piney
flavors
than
most
in
the
style
but
the
high
abv
and
smokey
malt
flavors
make
it
work
o
delicious
caramel
and
molasses
perfectly
balanced
malt
and
hops
the
bitterness
of
the
ipa
balances
perfectly
with
all
of
the
other
flavors
this
is
an
excellent
beer
o
a
great
beer
it
has
restored
my
faith
in
black
ipas
a
great
balance
between
malt
and
hops
nearly
perfect
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
ipa
but
not
great
stone
overhypes
themselves
by
doing
their
usual
bragging
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
but
this
brew
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
strong
hops
with
no
subtlety
roasted
malts
and
burnt
coffee
i
would
still
say
give
it
a
try
i
know
that
stone
is
a
popular
brewery
and
you
just
might
like
this
offering
more
than
i
o
ive
passed
over
this
beer
for
far
too
long
and
i
will
do
it
no
more
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
huge
but
it
is
slightly
more
bitter
than
i
would
like
but
thats
nitpicking
for
awhile
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
a
german
style
black
ale
but
boy
was
i
wrong
also
they
could
amp
up
the
roast
presence
ever
so
slightly
and
it
would
probably
be
the
best
black
ipa
out
there
but
i
really
dig
the
hop
profile
on
this
one
it
might
be
coincidence
that
i
find
nighttime
to
have
a
very
similar
hop
profile
or
maybe
not
this
is
great
beer
it
looks
like
a
stout
and
tastes
like
a
ipa
superb
hoppy
biter
taste
full
feeling
pleasent
taste
from
lips
to
throat
it
does
have
very
little
head
when
poured
from
the
bottle
but
i
would
drink
this
beer
very
often
stone
as
usual
hits
it
out
of
the
park
taste
actually
goes
the
other
way
around
now
with
the
roasted
malt
backbone
starting
first
its
very
roasted
with
a
burnt
bitterness
to
it
the
bitterness
is
compounded
with
an
aftertaste
of
piney
hops
dark
bitter
chocolate
lends
a
slight
but
fleeting
sweetness
throughly
thick
and
creamy
as
if
its
a
milk
stout
definitely
one
of
the
fullest
bodies
for
a
black
ipa
ive
had
o
a
very
good
drinkable
complex
beer
malt
and
hops
do
a
good
job
of
working
together
without
overpowering
the
other
will
definitely
drink
again
o
a
pretty
alright
almost
outstanding
beer
i
will
say
this
was
the
second
time
i
tried
the
beer
after
letting
my
tastebuds
mature
quite
a
bit
the
first
time
i
tried
it
i
found
it
absolutely
horrendous
and
overly
bitter
this
second
time
i
found
it
much
more
satisfying
so
if
you
dont
like
it
the
first
time
around
perhaps
wait
a
few
months
or
a
year
if
you
were
new
to
beer
and
try
it
again
overall
you
have
to
like
strong
intense
slow
sip
beers
to
appreciate
this
brew
if
you
are
that
type
of
drinker
or
if
you
are
a
fan
of
black
ipas
at
a
lll
you
will
love
this
beer
pours
very
dark
nearly
black
with
a
thin
head
but
does
have
good
lacing
in
the
pint
glass
smells
of
sweet
malt
a
pleasant
combination
of
malt
and
faint
coffee
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
remind
you
of
an
ipa
for
me
there
is
not
enough
distinguishable
fruit
and
a
lack
of
hop
presence
a
solid
ale
but
not
for
me
on
a
regular
basis
overall
a
great
beer
with
well
done
qualities
overall
this
beer
rules
stone
brewerys
fancy
wording
on
the
bottle
does
it
justice
this
is
the
kind
of
complex
beer
you
can
tell
they
made
repeat
batches
with
its
recipe
for
a
damned
good
reason
overall
this
beer
just
tastes
fantastic
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
not
so
bitter
where
a
regular
beer
drinker
who
is
into
craft
brews
wont
find
it
a
chore
to
finish
the
pint
a
ton
of
hops
at
the
beginning
but
it
doesnt
leave
you
with
an
overly
stickybitter
feeling
in
your
mouth
there
is
a
great
and
complex
flavor
to
the
beer
and
makes
you
want
to
come
back
for
more
pours
real
nice
dark
body
with
a
tan
foamy
head
nice
however
i
found
this
beer
to
be
cloyingly
sweet
and
not
enough
hop
presents
for
an
ipa
in
my
opinion
i
would
expect
something
on
the
level
of
the
regular
ipa
at
least
i
prefer
other
offerings
from
stone
i
lived
just
a
stones
throw
away
in
escondido
for
a
while
now
in
texas
i
find
this
and
am
left
wanting
wanting
a
really
high
hopped
ipa
overall
stone
cant
brew
a
bad
beer
they
just
cant
every
brew
they
make
is
outstanding
this
is
an
ipa
to
remember
thats
for
sure
every
time
i
see
a
stone
brew
i
have
not
had
yet
i
am
quick
to
snag
it
up
o
black
ipas
not
one
of
my
favotie
styles
by
any
means
but
this
is
just
a
phenomenal
brew
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
versions
of
a
black
ipa
just
simply
great
overall
great
black
ipa
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
tasty
mf
medium
bodied
with
a
dry
finish
smooth
start
with
a
sharp
carbonation
in
the
finish
4
5
o
really
enjoyable
and
not
everyday
flavour
down
to
have
one
of
these
whenever
the
opportunity
presents
itself
o
very
enjoyable
the
light
feel
of
this
black
ale
is
surprising
overall
ive
had
black
ipas
in
the
past
where
it
seemed
like
a
mediocre
ipa
was
blackened
in
the
hopes
of
improving
it
not
the
case
here
this
feels
alot
more
like
a
fantastic
ipa
that
has
been
enhanced
with
complimentary
flavors
of
roast
soy
sauce
and
a
whiff
of
molasses
a
wonderfully
complex
and
balanced
black
ipaale
must
try
overall
i
was
impressed
this
is
a
strong
yet
smooth
hop
bomb
easy
drinking
and
packed
with
flavor
possibly
one
of
the
biggest
heads
of
all
my
bottle
pours
i
never
had
an
ale
so
dark
what
an
awesome
heavy
brew
again
maybe
this
just
isnt
my
preferred
type
of
beer
amazing
hoppy
herbal
flavors
in
this
one
just
bursting
with
flavor
cant
even
taste
the
alcohol
wow
what
a
great
beer
perfect
score
for
this
one
i
am
pretty
surprised
by
this
one
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
black
ales
but
i
love
southern
tier
iniquity
the
astringent
aftertaste
on
this
one
makes
it
so
i
wont
have
another
in
the
future
overall
a
rather
tasty
and
moderately
stronger
black
ipa
it
had
a
nice
blend
of
big
pine
hop
flavors
and
roasted
malt
that
would
leave
one
craving
either
of
these
flavors
if
not
both
rather
satisfied
o
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
of
the
ones
ive
tried
so
far
definitely
one
that
you
can
try
more
than
once
and
enjoy
just
as
much
if
not
more
as
the
last
time
stone
has
made
a
beer
that
somehow
has
a
strong
and
intense
flavor
that
makes
you
wish
you
had
another
bottle
when
youre
done
im
not
really
a
fan
of
ipas
but
this
was
the
first
dark
ipa
id
ever
tried
it
is
smooth
and
rich
with
a
good
thick
head
that
lingers
just
long
enough
for
an
ale
i
had
it
from
a
bottle
served
just
under
room
temperature
about
55
or
60
degrees
the
smell
and
taste
are
that
of
most
ipas
that
ive
tried
very
piney
and
bitter
which
are
not
up
my
alley
but
this
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
not
too
much
carbonation
and
it
actually
goes
down
fairly
smooth
the
strong
hops
flavor
is
just
not
my
thing
this
may
be
a
fantastic
beer
to
a
true
ipa
fan
but
its
just
not
my
mug
of
ale
recommend
definitely
a
solid
black
ale
but
its
stone
so
why
would
i
expect
anything
other
than
excellence
i
am
typically
not
a
big
fan
of
black
ales
but
this
is
by
far
the
best
i
have
tried
it
smells
like
an
ipa
looks
like
a
porter
and
tastes
fantastic
floral
hoppy
slightly
piney
and
slightly
sweet
drinks
very
smooth
and
conceals
the
8
7
very
well
overall
a
very
good
beer
complex
and
big
in
taste
o
more
pine
than
i
like
nose
is
much
better
than
the
taste
still
recommended
especially
if
you
like
their
taste
in
hops
i
personally
dont
though
i
love
enjoy
by
ipa
o
the
bottle
had
passed
its
drink
by
date
by
a
few
weeks
but
i
dont
think
it
negatively
impacted
my
experience
ill
say
that
am
not
generally
a
huge
fan
of
black
ales
or
black
ipas
i
prefer
the
coffee
and
chocolate
or
grainy
goodness
of
stouts
and
porters
with
that
said
this
is
a
very
good
take
on
the
style
and
with
stones
signature
hop
profile
this
is
something
id
seek
out
again
o
i
can
see
why
it
was
one
of
stones
favorites
give
it
a
go
ive
always
been
a
lover
of
all
of
stones
ipa
products
but
had
not
delved
outside
of
that
line
of
beers
boy
am
i
glad
i
did
this
black
ipa
pours
and
tastes
much
more
like
a
porter
than
any
ipa
ive
ever
had
it
is
near
perfect
opaque
black
in
color
but
thin
and
smooth
in
body
starts
with
a
small
tan
head
that
dissipates
to
a
slight
tan
lacing
that
holds
well
to
the
glass
throughout
the
session
the
aroma
is
actually
very
subtle
with
a
lot
of
roasted
malt
scents
upfront
and
a
little
hop
and
sweetness
behind
it
the
flavor
is
nothing
like
i
expected
following
the
nose
it
is
rich
and
deep
with
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
and
maybe
even
a
little
pepper
great
balance
of
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
i
still
feel
this
one
falls
closer
to
porter
than
black
ipa
but
what
ever
it
is
i
think
ill
have
another
one
it
tastes
great
just
hoppy
enough
where
you
know
its
beer
oeasily
one
of
the
best
ipas
around
bold
and
robust
yet
tropical
and
refreshing
you
can
eat
the
beer
or
pair
it
with
food
everything
is
in
balance
with
this
beer
i
love
the
warming
bubbly
effect
what
ipas
do
that
only
a
cascadian
dark
aleblack
ipa
can
pull
this
off
sublimely
selfrighteous
matches
all
of
the
best
ipas
and
yet
cranks
up
the
hops
highly
and
is
packed
with
mysterious
head
scratching
flavors
so
known
yet
unknown
a
beer
stone
has
every
right
to
brag
about
hopefully
this
beer
will
be
permanently
made
and
available
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
in
my
top
5
and
has
been
for
a
while
now
a
pretty
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
for
sure
o
im
not
a
hophead
i
like
my
english
browns
but
stone
continues
to
make
me
a
convert
its
nicely
layered
with
malt
and
hops
and
gives
a
pleasant
complexity
id
buy
this
again
all
in
all
a
very
pleasing
ale
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
not
bad
and
i
dont
mind
drinking
it
at
all
this
ale
in
my
opinion
is
a
great
after
dinner
drink
a
very
well
crafted
beer
although
im
not
a
particular
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
id
definitely
drink
this
one
again
surprisingly
lightbodied
i
think
for
a
black
ipa
doesnt
weigh
down
on
the
palate
like
some
others
do
fond
of
this
one
o
very
good
black
ipa
lots
of
complex
flavors
going
on
very
enjoyable
a
great
enjoyable
offering
from
stone
that
is
better
than
many
black
ipas
black
ales
i
have
tried
not
worth
the
hype
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
it
is
almost
creamy
very
good
overall
another
of
stones
boastful
beers
lives
up
to
its
name
a
beer
this
good
certainly
deserves
a
good
deal
of
selfrighteousness
this
is
the
perfect
black
ipacascadian
dark
alehopped
black
aleetc
as
i
imagine
the
style
in
its
purest
form
overall
this
is
a
stellar
black
ipa
one
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
if
not
the
favorite
really
does
an
excellent
job
of
creating
a
balanced
meaty
refreshing
beer
that
has
the
best
of
both
worlds
that
are
quintessential
to
a
black
ipa
also
does
an
exceptional
job
of
concealing
the
almost9
abv
another
hit
for
me
picked
this
up
while
looking
for
stones
porter
as
replacement
for
lack
if
porter
luckily
for
me
the
porter
wasnt
in
stock
this
was
amazing
im
typically
a
quad
stout
or
porter
only
drinker
and
now
this
will
be
part
of
my
normal
purchase
routine
really
strong
herbal
hops
dominate
the
aroma
some
charcoal
cocoa
powder
mango
and
roast
notes
hit
the
nose
as
well
8
ball
black
appearance
with
some
decent
lacing
and
thin
foam
really
strong
bitter
hops
greet
the
palate
shortly
after
the
stout
quality
comes
through
delivering
strong
roast
dry
coffee
bean
oil
subtle
toffee
and
smokey
notes
to
the
palate
finish
is
immensely
dry
with
a
continuous
bitterness
herbs
and
strong
alcohol
as
it
warms
up
the
juicy
fruity
qualities
really
shine
through
with
grapefruit
juice
mango
tropical
fruits
and
pineapple
really
a
fantastic
take
on
the
style
o
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
the
flavors
balance
incredibly
well
despite
belonging
to
different
styles
to
me
this
was
a
quality
stout
meets
a
quality
ipa
honestly
how
can
you
beat
that
for
those
times
im
torn
between
the
two
styles
this
is
will
be
beautiful
solution
i
will
be
having
this
far
too
often
o
a
great
complex
ale
it
doesnt
fit
into
any
one
category
but
crosses
types
on
multiple
occasions
worst
bottle
of
beer
ive
had
from
stone
but
i
think
i
say
that
for
personal
reasons
im
sure
its
great
to
someone
but
not
to
me
it
looked
really
nice
finger
and
a
half
head
some
lacing
smelled
kind
of
foul
it
had
the
typical
hops
aroma
but
it
smelled
burnt
literally
like
a
burnt
piece
of
pine
wood
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
literally
i
dumped
the
second
half
out
perhaps
i
had
a
bad
bottle
thats
why
i
didnt
mark
it
any
lower
than
i
did
scared
to
try
again
though
i
will
stick
with
ruination
as
my
stone
brew
of
choice
o
nice
brew
just
getting
in
to
the
style
and
this
is
very
nice
recommended
cheers
really
suprised
by
the
fruitiness
of
this
beer
having
a
black
ale
that
brings
the
hops
and
fruits
to
the
table
like
this
is
just
awesome
love
it

overall
this
is
a
tremendous
ale
if
you
like
a
strong
hoppy
beer
this
is
the
one
for
you
stone
proves
why
it
is
a
hopheads
fantasy
i
strongly
recommend
this
one
and
will
seek
it
out
again
o
what
a
great
beer
to
ring
in
the
fall
season
its
deep
dark
bitter
complex
balanced
what
more
can
i
say
i
cant
wait
to
be
rocking
this
around
a
campfire
and
its
got
the
abv
to
keep
me
warm
not
boozy
at
all
for
such
a
high
abv
delicious
version
if
a
black
ipa
o
for
a
style
i
really
enjoy
this
one
was
not
as
great
as
i
was
hoping
for
a
nice
example
of
a
stronger
black
ipa
but
not
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
o
this
is
a
phenomenal
brew
a
must
have
taste
starts
with
grapefruit
and
orange
moving
on
to
a
ton
of
resin
followed
by
a
splash
of
floral
sweetness
then
an
onslaught
of
pine
finishing
with
a
charred
roastiness
with
coffee
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
has
a
roasty
floral
citric
coffee
aftertaste
has
just
below
average
body
with
above
average
carbonation
o
so
surprisingly
citrusy
bitter
very
unique
choice
of
hops
for
what
i
assume
to
beconsider
a
black
ipa
the
body
is
medium
going
neither
to
bright
and
soft
or
too
rich
and
thick
having
elements
of
each
and
offering
some
dryness
from
the
bitter
element
and
the
char
while
remaining
almost
juicy
despite
it
bitterness
lingers
in
a
full
finish
the
worst
stone
beer
ive
had
taste
wise
it
is
the
hoppiness
and
bitterness
hitting
you
but
well
balanced
with
hint
of
bananas
and
spices
nothing
is
very
too
strong
it
is
well
balanced
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
and
round
in
mouth
oa
damn
good
black
ipa
i
personally
like
thomas
creek
orangeblack
ipa
more
but
this
one
is
still
great
hops
are
a
touch
overwhelming
black
ipas
have
always
been
an
odd
mix
to
me
everything
is
there
roastyass
ipa
overall
this
is
definetley
a
pretty
cool
beer
worth
checking
out
not
my
favorite
though
stone
has
really
outdone
itself
if
you
ask
me
this
is
one
great
beer
that
brings
together
dark
malt
with
a
bit
of
bitter
of
its
own
from
the
burnt
and
charred
qualities
and
its
signature
hop
bitter
this
was
fruity
and
tremendously
sweet
that
sweetness
deepens
on
the
nose
and
in
the
drink
as
it
warms
but
it
never
surpasses
the
tart
fruits
or
the
piney
resin
the
brown
sugar
goes
so
well
with
the
orange
im
in
love
sticky
sweet
full
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
is
a
very
good
beer
pick
it
up
if
you
can
definitely
worth
the
try
o
this
is
my
favorite
black
ipa
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
im
so
glad
that
this
is
on
stones
lineup
and
is
available
year
round
at
a
decent
price
o
the
beer
is
strong
and
hoppy
taste
great
though
try
it
if
you
get
your
hands
on
it
because
they
have
the
ratio
of
taste
nailed
down
exactly
the
way
they
want
it
the
fellas
at
stone
arent
afraid
to
ramp
up
the
scale
of
boldness
what
theyve
left
us
with
is
a
beer
that
satisfies
with
every
sip
it
doesnt
leave
you
wanting
more
in
any
sense
of
the
word
because
it
gives
you
everything
already
in
spades
and
lets
be
honest
if
you
like
stone
this
is
what
you
looking
for
in
the
first
place
get
yourself
a
glass
but
do
save
some
for
me
because
this
is
a
beer
ill
be
seeing
again
o
this
is
actually
only
the
second
black
ipa
that
i
have
had
the
other
one
was
the
black
racer
ipa
from
bear
republic
i
think
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
would
probably
enjoy
this
better
during
the
day
in
a
hot
weather
but
overall
a
very
good
beer
o
a
really
wonderful
example
of
the
style
plus
extra
points
for
coming
in
a
four
pack
my
favorite
container
style
overall
drinkability
very
very
good
beer
i
really
wish
i
had
another
this
is
so
drinkable
full
of
flavor
great
appearance
and
mouthfeel
and
great
with
food
blts
tabbouleh
brownies
for
dessert
i
will
have
to
look
out
for
a
six
pack
of
this
one
oi
should
have
expected
a
black
ale
from
stone
to
pack
loads
of
hops
but
the
tropical
hop
onslaught
in
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
by
a
long
way
the
aroma
is
a
real
highpoint
in
fact
this
is
one
of
the
better
smelling
brews
i
have
tasted
recently
that
being
said
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
charredchocolatey
malts
from
this
brew
if
i
was
going
to
judge
to
style
overall
i
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
of
this
beer
because
every
other
stone
beer
ive
had
has
been
great
this
one
just
had
a
funk
to
it
that
was
a
little
cheesy
great
roasty
and
malty
flavors
with
some
solid
bitterness
on
the
finish
o
4
50
good
beer
great
black
ipa
not
as
amazing
as
stones
ipas
and
imperial
stouts
id
probably
say
wookey
jack
is
a
bit
better
with
dads
little
helper
rogue
and
dubhe
uinta
being
quite
a
bit
below
this
overall
drinkability
i
would
have
liked
some
more
roasty
notes
in
this
beer
but
it
works
as
an
ipa
overall
first
american
black
ale
just
awesome
really
enjoying
the
whole
experience
will
be
buying
this
again
really
enjoyed
it
had
this
on
tap
in
arlington
va
it
pours
a
nice
jet
black
color
into
a
tulip
glass
aroma
is
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
taste
is
a
little
weird
to
me
not
sure
if
its
possible
that
my
palate
just
isnt
appreciative
of
black
ipas
this
is
my
first
one
but
there
really
isnt
too
much
flavor
to
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
balance
but
the
hops
bite
i
get
from
other
ipas
just
isnt
there
on
this
one
ogreat
brew
very
complex
pours
black
with
no
head
from
the
bottle
aroma
of
sweet
roasty
malt
pine
hops
and
sweet
candy
flavor
is
smoky
malt
and
some
pine
hop
bitter
lots
of
smoke
for
a
non
smoked
beer
plenty
of
bite
from
the
hops
with
a
nice
clean
bitter
finish
medium
mouthfeel
with
more
than
adequate
carbonation
solid
beer
but
im
not
sure
it
belongs
with
the
likes
of
wookey
jack
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
but
the
hop
profile
didnt
impress
me
as
much
as
other
black
ipas
and
the
bitterness
was
just
a
little
too
aggressive
in
this
beer
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
wasnt
too
smooth
and
the
alcohol
was
a
little
too
warming
for
its
strength
but
the
flavors
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
would
be
enough
for
me
i
think
the
bitterness
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
if
i
had
more
then
one
what
i
like
the
most
about
the
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
they
were
both
very
good
with
appearance
being
the
best
it
may
be
the
best
looking
black
ipa
i
have
ever
seen
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
flavor
it
wasnt
bad
i
just
wish
the
hop
profile
highlighted
those
citrus
hops
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
more
and
i
thought
the
bitterness
was
just
too
intense
for
this
beer
it
would
really
help
the
drinkability
if
it
was
toned
down
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
its
no
a
bad
beer
but
theres
many
more
black
ipas
that
i
like
more
than
this
one
so
i
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
it
anytime
soon
and
i
think
its
a
little
overpriced
but
i
would
recommend
that
any
fan
of
the
style
at
least
give
it
a
try
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
this
beer
stone
is
very
good
with
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
fell
a
little
short
in
my
eyes
and
it
didnt
have
a
hop
profile
that
kept
me
coming
back
for
me
better
luck
next
time
guys
o
great
overall
well
executed
though
its
not
my
favorite
style
really
big
bold
flavors
youd
expect
from
stone
this
beer
is
unusual
diverse
tasting
elements
are
brought
together
in
an
odd
balancing
act
light
chocolate
aroma
intense
grapefruit
and
a
special
crisp
refreshing
hops
and
bitterness
pours
an
almost
black
color
with
a
medium
long
lasting
beige
creamy
head
with
good
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
orange
peel
pine
hops
upfront
with
some
good
dark
caramel
chocolate
malt
taste
is
of
dark
chocolate
malt
a
bit
of
liquorices
with
a
good
amount
of
citrus
hops
a
medium
to
full
oily
body
on
the
palate
slightly
smooth
with
a
sweet
bitter
sticky
mouth
feel
the
finish
is
a
combination
of
sweet
dark
caramel
malt
chocolate
some
brown
sugar
the
ending
is
sweet
bitter
liquorices
and
citrus
orange
bitterness
for
balance
caramel
malt
flavor
shows
through
more
as
it
warms
up
although
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
it
is
an
interesting
combination
of
flavors
but
still
a
very
good
and
tasty
brew
well
done
this
beers
title
is
welljustified
it
is
righteous
love
it
overall
excellent
very
wellbalanced
with
big
flavors
and
very
drinkable
not
much
bad
you
can
say
about
this
affordable
and
very
tasty
approachable
for
fans
of
west
coast
ipas
and
darker
beers
alike
overall
i
like
it
its
the
most
expensive
beer
ive
ever
had
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
good
job
stone
fresh
i
dont
care
for
this
beer
one
bit
too
hoppy
and
the
malt
hasnt
really
developed
much
too
smoky
and
roasty
too
however
i
sat
on
a
bottle
for
like
6
months
and
gave
it
another
try
and
holy
crap
its
amazing
it
balances
out
so
much
better
the
hoppiness
dies
down
considerably
the
smokiness
too
the
roasty
maltiness
tones
down
a
ton
too
really
smooths
out
and
becomes
extremely
enjoyable
overall
i
could
drink
this
everyday
and
not
get
tired
of
it
fantastic
beer
i
did
not
take
notes
on
this
ale
so
im
going
on
memory
i
was
not
impressed
with
this
ale
it
had
a
burnt
taste
and
smell
it
was
not
very
smooth
i
was
ok
with
the
hops
level
but
was
way
too
harsh
this
was
a
very
ok
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
to
see
if
i
had
a
bad
bottle
packed
full
of
flavor
this
brew
is
about
as
complex
as
they
get
most
black
ipas
dont
jive
for
me
as
the
roast
malt
character
and
citrusy
hops
often
collide
in
a
negative
way
but
not
the
case
with
this
one
the
bitterness
is
a
touch
more
than
i
prefer
what
a
great
beer
dark
a
really
dark
tan
coloralmost
black
fair
carbonation
coffee
fan
you
will
love
this
bitter
beer
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
goes
down
smooth
but
has
an
unexpected
bitter
finish
this
beer
is
overwhelming
and
pretty
much
dominates
your
palette
do
not
start
with
this
first
unless
you
only
plan
on
drinking
this
all
night
or
plan
to
move
up
to
something
even
more
rich
in
flavor
love
the
beer
but
if
they
scaled
back
the
bitterness
it
would
be
superb
as
it
is
this
is
great
beer
with
a
small
flaw
to
my
palate
o
i
am
duly
impressed
gives
wooky
jack
a
run
for
its
money
oh
this
is
just
tasty
one
of
my
favorite
if
not
favorite
black
ales
delicious
complex
smooth
superb
balance
ill
get
this
again
and
i
love
the
fact
that
you
can
get
small
bottles
not
too
hoppy
at
all
in
my
opinion
stone
just
knows
how
to
make
good
beerssome
more
than
others
but
this
is
more
than
some
excellent
o
although
this
isnt
one
of
my
usual
styles
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
not
something
i
would
sit
and
drink
a
lot
of
but
on
its
own
is
a
really
nice
brew
it
should
go
well
with
my
steak
and
gravy
tonight
o
ipas
typically
dont
have
much
appeal
for
me
i
am
a
stout
lover
to
the
core
but
i
find
this
one
to
have
just
enough
stout
characteristics
to
have
some
merit
i
also
had
this
on
tap
recently
and
found
it
to
be
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
very
deceptive
definitely
a
good
gateway
beer
for
those
who
loves
stouts
but
are
having
trouble
with
ipas
o
a
great
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
just
what
im
looking
for
in
bipas
good
stuff
ill
definitely
drink
this
again
to
be
honest
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
since
its
from
stone
brewing
i
knew
it
wasnt
going
to
bad
i
didnt
think
it
was
going
to
be
this
good
in
the
end
this
beer
was
very
roasted
and
very
well
balanced
would
i
drink
it
again
yeah
i
would
this
is
a
really
good
beer
not
one
i
would
like
to
drink
every
day
but
sparingly
it
stands
out
as
a
true
champion
of
beers
all
beers
its
not
quite
inside
any
true
style
i
dont
think
it
kinda
stands
on
its
own
on
many
levels
if
you
havent
tried
it
you
most
definitely
should
but
dont
be
afraid
to
leave
this
one
for
later
in
the
night
it
will
not
be
pushed
around
by
others
darker
than
i
was
expecting
almost
a
black
copper
malts
dominate
the
smell
big
taste
of
caramel
malts
dry
hop
bitterness
and
alcohol
the
head
diminishes
quickly
but
leaves
thick
swaths
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
hint
of
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
vey
pleasant
a
strong
filling
ale
with
lots
of
character
definitely
not
an
everyday
ale
but
makes
a
good
impression
when
the
occasion
occurs
o
first
time
trying
this
beer
and
will
certainly
buy
again
love
the
look
of
this
beer
and
obviously
more
importantly
the
taste
a
lot
going
on
yet
nothing
is
out
of
place
have
yet
to
have
a
bad
beer
by
stone
brewing
and
theyre
probably
my
favorite
brewery
highly
recommend
this
brew
d
very
drinkable
goes
down
easily
maybe
too
easy
such
an
interesting
beer
it
has
the
hop
profile
of
an
ipa
but
the
malt
profile
of
a
porter
or
stout
pine
resin
taste
from
the
hops
and
a
roasted
taste
from
the
malt
also
a
hint
of
chocolate
or
espresso
as
well
i
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
another
great
from
stone
o
this
is
a
really
interesting
beer
tastes
like
an
ipastout
overall
okay
after
an
underberg
it
tasted
a
lot
better
straight
4s
more
please
o
worth
the
try
but
not
going
to
fit
on
my
list
of
regulars
o
great
beer
from
stone
all
i
can
say
cant
quite
understand
it
but
its
certainly
different
and
that
makes
it
worth
trying
o
i
seem
to
have
a
lovehate
relationship
with
this
style
and
this
one
is
definitely
on
the
love
side
i
love
the
complex
dominant
hop
profile
but
the
roast
malt
supports
the
hops
just
right
for
the
style
this
beer
reinforces
stone
as
a
goto
brewery
for
me
o
i
am
very
impressed
by
this
beer
while
i
am
far
from
a
huge
fan
of
stone
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
by
them
right
up
with
espresso
irs
and
enjoy
by
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
this
beer
again
and
i
will
probably
purchase
it
again
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
black
ipatype
beer
which
is
really
what
this
reminds
me
of
if
hop
in
the
dark
were
available
yearround
this
would
have
a
bit
more
contest
but
as
it
is
this
may
become
the
goto
for
me
in
its
style
o
i
hate
this
beer
im
not
a
fan
of
black
ipas
to
begin
with
and
this
beer
is
exactly
why
i
dont
like
them
the
flavors
dont
mingle
well
together
its
too
bitter
but
not
in
super
hopped
up
way
i
just
dont
get
this
style
i
may
never
buy
another
black
ipa
ever
again
serious
overall
an
awesome
cascadian
dark
ale
very
strong
at
8
7
abv
but
very
drinkable
and
full
of
huge
flavors
perhaps
my
favorite
yearround
offering
from
stone
picture
arrogant
bastard
with
a
bit
roasted
barley
and
a
tad
more
alcohol
hops
are
a
bit
less
forward
in
this
beer
you
now
have
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
tan
head
black
as
night
great
lacing
mouth
feel
just
right
delicious
definitely
buy
this
one
next
time
i
see
it
oone
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
tasted
cant
believe
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
beer
overall
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
with
just
one
tasting
session
ive
bought
another
bottle
and
will
enjoy
it
again
soon
i
highly
recommend
trying
a
piece
of
dark
chocolate
85
with
the
drink
after
thoroughly
tasting
it
o
i
know
some
people
are
on
the
fence
about
black
ales
i
love
them
this
is
really
good
and
the
flavors
harmonize
well
not
as
good
as
the
espresso
sublimely
selfrighteous
or
hop
in
the
dark
but
a
close
third
plus
its
year
round
that
a
plus
overall
very
enjoyable
i
dont
really
drink
black
ipas
often
but
i
think
i
should
start
or
at
least
buy
this
beer
more
often
the
color
is
a
very
dark
with
a
large
thick
head
and
the
aroma
is
hoppy
with
citrus
and
resin
notes
showing
out
the
loudest
the
taste
is
bitter
slightly
sweet
and
reminds
me
of
some
imperial
stouts
out
there
the
aftertaste
combines
a
long
bitter
finish
soft
carbonation
medium
body
and
a
slightly
sticky
texture
overall
boom
friggin
awesome
black
ipa
was
thinking
about
inviting
the
neighbor
over
for
a
taste
but
after
getting
halfway
through
the
first
glass
decided
im
finishing
this
bomber
myself
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
pours
a
black
color
with
a
small
lacing
head
there
is
a
nice
smokey
but
mostly
floral
aroma
the
taste
has
a
sharp
hoppy
kick
then
finished
smooth
and
smokey
with
hints
of
a
burnt
like
malt
flavors
good
full
flavors
overall
this
beer
is
soo
incredibly
enjoyable
great
full
intense
flavors
pours
black
but
not
too
thick
very
nice
creamy
tan
head
that
left
ample
lacing
on
sides
of
the
glass
nice
job
of
combining
a
great
stout
with
a
great
ipa
you
get
to
enjoy
all
of
the
complex
flavours
of
both
beer
types
in
just
the
right
combination
another
great
stone
offering
would
highly
suggest
giving
it
a
try
classy
ale
with
that
stone
intensity
dark
and
satisfying
delightful
overall
i
will
be
buying
this
upon
seeing
it
tastes
amazing
i
would
say
this
beer
tastes
very
similar
to
sweetwaters
happy
ending
seasonal
if
youve
had
that
or
this
you
will
love
the
other
except
this
one
is
a
tad
bit
more
malt
heavy
either
way
i
love
dark
beer
with
lots
of
hops
and
if
you
do
too
stone
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
well
crafted
beer
o
this
is
a
damn
good
black
ipa
big
but
not
boozy
hoppy
as
hell
but
not
overpoweringly
bitter
some
maltiness
and
oh
so
much
mmm
this
resembles
an
ipa
with
little
black
qualities
in
the
taste
the
scent
got
my
hopes
up
but
the
taste
and
feel
really
let
me
down
overall
right
now
this
seems
like
a
ba
its
closer
to
a
b
for
having
a
typical
ipa
flavor
profile
but
strives
toward
an
a
because
of
its
unique
mouthfeel
overall
wheres
the
8
drinkability
and
taste
are
awesome
more
please
great
pizza
beer
glad
i
tried
it
it
is
readily
available
and
it
will
be
on
my
list
again
in
the
future
but
no
hurries
my
first
reaction
was
wow
this
is
going
to
make
a
strong
case
for
being
my
favorite
beer
and
that
holds
true
i
had
it
on
tap
but
cant
wait
to
pick
up
a
case
the
body
was
moderately
light
some
drying
finish
and
ashy
astringent
finishes
carbonation
was
light
overall
good
hop
presence
but
because
of
the
off
yeast
notes
i
couldnt
finish
it
o
still
a
great
beer
when
i
buy
my
yearly
case
i
might
start
aging
half
of
them
as
they
were
different
yet
delicious
really
well
done
beer
amazingly
big
in
the
nose
and
mouth
not
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
but
still
really
good
fantastic
beer
hop
flavors
and
scents
are
complex
and
intense
and
the
malt
presence
is
the
perfect
counterpart
this
is
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
if
more
black
ipas
were
like
this
they
wouldnt
beso
much
like
the
redheaded
stepchild
of
beer
styles
overall
once
again
an
excellent
offering
from
stone
just
like
the
last
beer
i
reviewed
i
was
not
sure
what
to
classify
it
as
until
i
got
home
and
reviewed
it
i
see
here
ba
has
it
as
an
american
black
which
is
fine
these
hybrid
beers
are
wicked
good
hats
off
to
the
brewers
try
this
beer
out
asap
condor
recommended
o
if
i
was
entertaining
an
ipalover
i
would
get
them
this
usually
i
do
buy
daisy
cutter
or
dog
fish
head
90
minute
ipa
but
this
would
be
good
in
the
ipa
rotation
10
99
for
4
pk
o
pretty
good
black
ipa
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
a
black
ipa
i
like
hops
so
it
wasnt
bad
just
not
to
style
in
my
opinion
it
also
does
not
have
that
great
of
a
scent
but
this
is
a
real
solid
beer
and
i
would
highly
recommend
it
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
tasty
dark
brown
with
ruby
edges
the
nose
is
pungently
hoppy
the
flavor
profile
is
strong
on
the
hops
but
the
roasted
malt
takes
a
bit
of
a
back
seat
note
i
would
be
willing
to
try
it
at
a
warmer
temp
perhaps
it
might
mellow
out
or
add
some
depth
i
just
dont
get
the
bitter
beer
movement
overall
impression
a
very
pleasant
dark
ipa
i
cant
say
id
enjoy
more
than
one
bomber
in
a
night
due
to
its
complexity
but
the
taste
is
overall
impressive
definitely
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
a
dark
ipa
i
can
see
why
this
beer
was
brought
back
after
being
the
stone
11th
anniversary
o
a
very
interesting
beer
like
a
superhoppy
porter
or
a
fullbodied
black
ipa
stones
beers
frequently
defy
categorization
but
in
this
case
thats
a
good
thing
this
one
gets
straight
4s
from
me
because
i
was
impressed
albeit
not
floored
in
every
field
would
certainly
buy
again
overall
it
drinks
very
solid
there
is
no
offensive
flavors
to
be
found
and
is
very
expertly
made
i
just
dont
enjoy
the
taste
enough
to
finish
a
22
oz
bottle
definitely
presents
itself
as
a
strong
alcohol
forward
beer
a
great
drink
o
as
expected
a
top
notch
wellcrafted
black
ipa
this
is
a
great
beer
o
if
you
cant
make
up
you
mind
between
a
russian
imperial
stout
and
a
imperial
ipa
this
is
the
beer
for
you
its
like
mixing
old
rasputin
with
palate
wrecker
a
masterpiece
by
stone
this
is
almost
just
exactly
perfect
it
pours
up
a
deep
ebony
black
with
a
generous
foamy
tan
head
good
retention
and
lacing
just
about
unlike
any
ever
seen
before
for
this
style
the
smell
is
a
powerful
and
satisfying
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
coffee
taste
is
an
initial
malty
sweetnesss
giving
way
to
a
big
coffee
taste
of
a
finish
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
lucious
almost
just
exactly
perfect

i
think
ive
only
had
one
other
black
ale
but
im
liking
the
style
i
forgot
about
this
in
the
back
of
my
fridge
for
im
thinking
more
than
three
months
and
my
store
is
notorious
for
old
shelf
stock
so
i
dont
know
how
old
this
is
but
it
could
be
substantial
dont
see
a
date
but
knowing
stone
i
imagine
it
would
have
been
a
good
bit
hoppier
when
fresh
and
that
may
explain
the
depression
which
i
wont
quite
call
a
hole
o
outstanding
can
drink
this
everyday
of
the
week
this
is
at
the
top
of
the
black
ipas
in
my
opinion
very
appealing
root
beer
appearance
with
coppery
edges
a
large
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
thin
layer
of
foam
and
sparse
lacing
as
it
recedes
the
aroma
is
a
blend
of
citrus
and
sharp
hops
a
bit
metallic
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
a
jar
full
of
old
pennies
just
opened
i
loved
that
smell
as
a
kid
strong
hops
bitterness
hits
up
front
citrus
again
with
a
little
hint
of
alcohol
followed
by
some
mild
maltiness
just
the
right
level
of
carbonation
the
hops
drys
the
mouth
and
leaves
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
delicious
unique
and
satisfying
ale
all
around
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
me
i
love
the
hop
forward
presence
dont
taste
the
alcohol
at
all
this
was
pretty
disappointing
im
a
huge
fan
of
stone
but
this
ale
really
didnt
do
anything
for
me
however
while
the
taste
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
the
aroma
was
phenomenal
this
beer
is
exceptional
and
can
be
drank
in
nearly
every
setting
much
like
all
of
stones
brews
sublimely
selfrighteous
is
a
true
beer
that
does
not
make
you
cringe
or
question
but
instead
it
delivers
2
notches
above
what
you
were
hoping
for
i
love
this
beer
o
overall
tasty
but
the
individual
flavors
dont
seem
to
match
well
for
me
probably
wont
try
this
one
again
also
a
bit
pricey
compared
to
stones
other
offerings
o
full
disclosure
i
am
not
a
fan
of
ipas
in
any
form
but
since
this
one
was
from
stone
i
felt
it
warranted
a
try
a
remarkable
representation
of
the
style
and
priced
reasonably
which
is
not
always
the
case
when
looking
to
buy
a
brew
from
stone
i
will
finish
my
bomber
and
enjoy
the
experience
of
tasting
a
truly
remarkable
american
black
ale
however
i
probably
will
not
purchase
again
simply
out
of
personal
preference
o
my
favorite
black
ale
so
far
im
still
not
particularly
sold
on
the
style
but
this
example
is
pretty
good
this
is
a
quality
ale
the
great
thing
is
that
its
now
being
sold
in
4
packs
as
opposed
to
the
22oz
format
im
a
fan
of
stone
and
will
continue
to
support
them
by
purchasing
more
sublimely
overall
a
really
good
black
ipa
but
i
want
more
roast
there
is
not
enough
here
to
firmly
set
this
apart
from
a
normal
ipa
that
complaint
aside
an
excellent
beer
all
around
when
it
comes
to
taste
this
is
the
real
deal
the
front
is
dominated
by
the
aforementioned
pine
hops
that
bite
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
the
middle
of
the
sip
reveals
a
very
creamy
slightly
waxy
mouthfeel
that
brings
out
a
really
balanced
malt
profile
which
eventually
coalesces
back
with
the
hop
profile
near
the
end
until
a
wonderful
finish
of
dark
chocolate
gets
the
last
word
medium
carbonation
provides
a
nice
bite
and
meshes
perfectly
with
the
slightly
roasted
chocolatey
finish
an
absolutely
stellar
example
of
balance
and
linear
taste
progression
from
these
arrogant
bastards
however
i
just
cant
get
over
that
taste
probably
my
biggest
disappointment
from
stone
ever
solid
black
ale
classic
stone
brewing
hop
character
m
medium
leading
into
full
very
easy
to
drink
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
smooth
depth
of
flavor
handsome
complexion
a
true
work
of
art
and
the
grandest
scale
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
style
that
i
am
discovering
that
i
like
not
quite
as
wookey
jack
from
my
memory
but
the
mix
of
hops
and
dark
malts
is
superb
except
for
that
slight
finishing
flavor
wish
these
werent
8
a
bomber
o
nice
winter
beer
for
us
hop
heads
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
is
it
seems
like
hops
used
may
not
be
just
right
to
compliment
the
malt
something
seems
ever
so
slightly
off
i
bet
this
will
go
great
with
a
maduro
cigar
i
will
try
that
combo
tomorrow
pours
a
nearly
pitch
black

with

significant
weblike

light

rind
finishes
with
bitter
rind
pine
and
roasted
grain
and
malt
well
carbonated
smooth
and
silky
a
fantastic
black
ipa
a
brew
that
was
one
of
the
first
to
define
the
style
o
a
hoppy
dark
ale
mission
accomplished
o
great
like
any
stone
brew
very
hop
forward
but
well
balanced
and
tasty
well
done
heres
to
11
and
111
more
o
this
is
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
and
probably
the
first
i
actually
seeked
out
to
try
stone
sets
the
bar
for
this
style
and
everyone
else
follow
in
line
im
sure
there
are
some
good
black
ipas
out
there
but
i
cant
imagine
any
being
better
than
this
a
few
may
be
equal
but
for
me
this
is
the
standard
for
american
black
ipas
and
is
already
becoming
a
classic
for
the
style
o
amazing
beer
definitely
my
favorite
easy
to
come
by
drink
any
time
beer
possibly
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
especially
any
one
looking
to
explore
the
black
ipa
style
d
for
a
nearly
9
beer
this
goes
down
almost
too
easily
o
this
is
a
well
made
beer
with
terrific
flavors
well
hopped
with
dark
fruit
sweetness
for
balance
an
excellent
black
ale
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
with
inch
of
deep
mocha
head
smell
is
very
malt
forward
with
chocolate
and
other
roasted
notes
with
some
definite
pieny
hops
taste
is
substantial
really
nice
body
to
this
beer
and
great
balance
of
raosted
malts
and
piney
hops
with
a
very
creamy
and
somewhat
sweet
finish
great
finish
on
this
beer
actually
makes
you
want
more
final
thoughts
another
great
hoppy
beer
from
stone
they
get
bonus
points
for
adding
a
best
by
date
on
every
bottle
which
assured
i
got
fresh
beer
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
overall
stone
has
set
the
bar
for
black
ipas
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
on
the
market
as
it
is
so
well
rounded
in
all
categories
and
is
worthy
of
its
namesake
this
really
an
excellent
beer
the
hops
taste
so
fresh
and
so
well
balanced
need
i
say
more
o
stone
is
never
a
disappointment
this
is
a
great
beer
possibly
a
good
session
beer
even
though
you
might
make
it
to
6
on
these
hahaha
o
this
is
a
tough
guy
to
drink
quickly
plan
appropriately
all
around
solid
beer
o
extremely
well
balanced
and
about
perfect
for
the
style
im
an
ipa
fan
but
this
is
a
great
option
for
the
winter
months
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
overall
better
than
i
remember
stone
really
blends
a
nice
malty
hop
blend
here
and
makes
a
benchmark
for
the
rest
of
the
style
note
to
self
rated
4
american
black
ale
when
i
tried
it
o
one
of
the
most
readily
available
and
yet
best
black
ales
out
there
this
style
is
becoming
more
popular
but
its
difficult
to
find
examples
that
are
as
good
as
this
let
alone
as
easy
to
get
it
does
a
good
job
of
balancing
hops
and
roasted
malts
both
very
present
but
without
one
overwhelming
the
other
o
overall
stone
never
ceases
to
impress
me
this
was
a
very
interesting
beer
had
a
nice
contrast
of
mellow
easy
going
mouth
feel
paired
with
the
very
bitter
strong
hop
backlash
i
liked
it
not
a
bad
pick
at
all
o
well
damn
it
this
is
what
matters
most
right
i
hold
this
beer
like
i
hold
my
member
it
is
precious
o
i
dont
think
my
palate
knows
what
to
do
with
black
ales
just
yet
the
tropical
notes
just
dont
seem
to
mesh
well
with
the
heavy
malt
this
is
good
but
nothing
id
by
again
dont
think
i
can
appreciate
black
ales
black
in
color
with
brownish
hues
on
the
edge
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
thick
beige
foam
with
excellent
staying
power
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
black
patent
malt
and
citrus
and
resinous
pine
hop
aromas
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
smooth
feel
dark
roasted
and
burnt
malt
flavors
below
intense
bitter
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
a
nice
combination
of
intense
flavors
with
a
delicate
feel
drinkability
excellent
this
is
something
i
will
definitely
drink
again
oa
flavorful
black
ale
my
favorite
of
this
style
wow
what
a
beer
i
think
this
might
be
my
favourite
stone
brew
yet
incredibly
hoppy
although
the
malt
provides
good
balance
while
lurking
discretely
in
the
background
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
peerless
amazing
i
dont
think
i
could
recommend
this
too
highly
form
a
line
hoplovers
selfrighteousness
shall
be
yours
some
have
called
sublimely
selfrighteous
ales
flavor
muddled
i
disagree
though
they
are
many
the
beers
flavors
mingle
well
and
complement
each
other
i
would
not
call
this
beer
balanced
but
thats
okay
some
beers
challenge
the
mind
and
palate
there
is
balance
and
counterpoint
among
this
brews
complex
flavors
which
take
time
to
develop
and
never
rest
sip
slowly
and
watch
the
colors
dance
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
some
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
roasty
and
citrus
zest
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
but
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
sublime
it
truly
is
stone
as
usual
never
disappoints
not
only
that
it
over
delivers
all
the
time
excellent
stuff
there
highly
recommended
for
hop
heads
for
winter
drinking
smells
of
a
wonderful
blend
of
blackened
roasted
malts
and
fresh
juicy
citric
hopping
of
both
oranges
and
grapefruits
as
the
glass
warms
resinous
hopping
aroma
joins
in
as
well
the
flavor
is
slightly
more
roastedfocused
than
the
nose
is
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
hopping
is
not
well
represented
there
is
plenty
of
piney
goodness
to
go
around
it
overall
keeps
very
dry
and
abv
is
about
75
hidden
there
is
a
rising
warmth
in
the
background
but
mostly
the
orange
peel
hopping
is
made
fruitier
and
richer
by
the
abv
presence
which
is
a
good
thing
in
my
book
this
is
one
of
the
best
black
iipas
out
there
on
the
market
imho
o
excellent
beer
not
something
i
will
drink
often
may
enjoy
as
the
weather
really
turns
cold
stone
is
awesome
need
i
say
more
o
a
solid
beer
in
this
category
definitely
not
much
in
the
way
of
balance
but
thats
ok
because
its
damn
good
im
frequently
at
a
toss
up
between
the
well
balanced
american
black
ales
or
the
hop
heavy
ones
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
hop
forward
ones
being
my
first
stone
beer
in
nearly
two
years
its
too
early
to
say
how
it
stacks
up
with
the
rest
of
their
lineup
however
the
price
is
great
10
99
for
a
4pack
and
i
imagine
this
will
become
a
part
of
my
regular
drinking
lineup
i
love
this
beer
because
its
so
unique
its
almost
starts
off
in
your
mouth
like
an
ipa
then
transforms
into
a
porter
right
in
front
of
your
palette
one
of
the
first
brews
i
ever
had
from
stone
and
it
surely
did
not
disappoint
great
beer
o
overall
this
ipa
is
very
good
loaded
with
hops
compulsively
drinkable
and
sublimely
selfrighteous
thank
you
again
stone
it
pours
dark
with
good
clarity
and
mildmedium
retention
it
smells
super
hoppy
and
has
a
mild
malt
taste
it
has
a
bigger
body
than
i
expected
and
has
a
bunch
of
malts
and
then
a
powerful
hop
finish
great
beer
for
ipa
fans
oamerican
black
ales
have
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
styles
as
counter
intuitive
blend
of
bitter
citrusy
hops
blended
with
the
sweeter
smokier
stout
has
always
created
a
very
intriguing
flavor
profile
i
would
say
this
is
either
my
second
or
third
favorite
black
ale
behind
coasts
event
horizon
and
potentially
southern
tiers
inequity
this
stone
brew
relies
heavier
on
the
stout
side
of
things
that
makes
it
more
unique
than
other
brews
and
for
many
a
great
intro
into
the
style
overall
just
a
great
beer
one
of
my
favorites
stone
really
nailed
a
style
that
can
be
hit
or
miss
o
this
is
unlike
any
other
beer
and
is
remarkably
affordable
given
its
quality
in
a
lineup
that
ranges
from
good
porter
pale
to
incredible
ipa
irs
sublimely
self
righteous
is
maybe
stones
apotheosis
not
sure
why
this
is
classified
as
an
american
black
ale
its
more
like
a
double
black
ipa
to
me
and
a
good
one
at
that
o
this
is
seriously
one
bitter
and
dry
beer
which
is
not
surprising
from
stone
this
is
like
a
black
ipa
version
of
ruination
while
the
flavor
profile
has
some
differences
from
15th
anniversary
black
ipa
both
are
among
the
driest
and
most
bitter
beers
i
have
had
o
an
amazing
beer
and
the
cream
of
the
crop
in
black
ipas
in
my
experience
in
any
case
a
world
class
beer
all
hop
heads
should
seek
out
had
i
not
been
able
to
look
at
this
beer
i
would
have
sworn
that
it
was
an
ipa
neither
my
nose
nor
my
palate
could
pick
up
any
more
than
an
inkling
of
roastiness
or
malty
sweetness
personally
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
balance
but
what
can
you
expect
from
stone
over
all
this
is
the
beer
getting
me
interested
in
black
ipas
one
of
my
favorites
will
continue
to
be
one
of
my
regular
pick
ups
overall
the
quintessential
black
ipa
i
remember
first
trying
this
black
ipa
several
years
ago
and
being
absolutely
blown
away
because
not
only
did
it
possess
the
bright
hop
forward
and
citrusy
flavor
profile
of
an
imperial
ipa
but
it
also
had
the
appearance
and
chocolatey
and
slightly
roasty
malt
characteristics
of
a
great
and
smooth
porter
nowadays
it
seems
like
more
and
more
black
ipas
forget
to
include
the
chocolate
roastiness
of
porters
in
their
taste
sublimely
selfrighteous
certainly
doesnt
succumb
to
this
pitfall
and
definitely
earns
its
namesake
year
after
year
this
is
one
of
the
most
deceptively
colored
beers
really
tastes
like
a
standard
double
ipa
than
a
black
ipa
deep
roasted
malt
comes
through
a
touch
in
the
beginning
of
the
sip
but
huge
resinous
hop
presence
comes
through
almost
instantly
despite
the
massive
amount
of
hops
and
big
bitterness
pretty
good
balance
a
bit
of
detectable
alcohol
touch
of
malt
but
this
beer
is
a
big
hop
show
case
if
you
love
double
ipas
youll
love
it
because
big
pretty
good
tasting
and
pretty
standard
however
for
such
a
dark
beer
the
malt
really
doesnt
play
as
much
of
a
role
as
you
expect
it
good
but
i
was
expecting
much
more
especially
at
the
price
great
beer
one
of
my
favorite
black
ipas
definitely
the
benchmark
for
the
style
i
love
this
beer
certainly
my
favorite
black
ipa
i
have
had
to
this
point
i
will
drink
this
again
often
update
9412
i
have
drank
this
beer
a
few
more
times
since
this
review
once
on
tap
and
a
couple
bottles
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
my
original
review
and
it
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
black
ipas
now
i
have
updated
my
scores
and
review
accordingly
othis
really
is
an
ipa
with
a
dark
color
its
possible
that
due
to
that
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
black
ales
out
there
its
drinkable
and
tasty
and
not
at
a
terrible
price
would
make
this
ale
is
black
and
it
quickly
eats
up
any
attempt
color
throws
at
it
only
in
the
outer
edges
of
its
deathly
grasp
can
you
faintly
detect
a
simple
shade
of
red
escaping
this
beats
is
trapped
by
a
thick
billowy
cloud
of
bubbles
tan
in
color
and
very
tempting
like
the
sirens
of
old
as
described
to
me
by
homerand
they
bring
friends
many
friends
to
lure
you
into
their
depth
good
lacing
if
youve
been
to
hell
and
back
then
you
certainly
recognize
the
odor
of
sulfur
hops
hops
and
more
hops
all
mixed
in
with
some
dark
fruit
and
citrus
aromas
here
and
there
if
youve
ever
eaten
eskimo
py
then
this
beast
will
fair
no
different
among
the
best
tastes
in
the
world
simply
delightful
for
a
hophead
relatively
light
bodied
for
this
brewer
but
the
hops
are
present
and
do
not
disappoint
the
roasted
barley
is
fresh
and
its
bite
is
mild
and
only
gives
you
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
it
contains
the
citrus
flavors
you
feel
when
it
first
hits
you
are
quickly
transformed
into
a
lasting
and
lingering
burnt
hops
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
good
ale
overall
quite
a
good
beer
sublimely
is
yet
another
stellar
showing
from
stone
its
the
best
of
both
worlds
with
malty
and
hoppy
characters
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
persistent
root
beer
head
aroma
is
conspicuously
absent
given
the
gorgeous
presentation
some
raw
grain
some
citrus
hop
notes
nice
evenly
balanced
mouthfeel
between
the
fullness
and
the
carbonation
flavors
are
comprised
of
spooned
mashing
grain
lemon
pine
and
grass
some
dark
roasted
barley
finishes
with
some
faint
pine
and
unfermented
sugar
big
beer
but
not
because
of
any
one
big
flavor
this
is
my
favorite
stone
brew
thats
not
saying
a
lot
because
i
think
most
are
deplorable
but
i
do
like
this
one
a
lot
stone
has
a
reason
to
be
proud
of
this
one
i
cant
understate
how
complex
this
beer
tastesso
much
so
that
i
feel
that
im
missing
something
and
underrating
it
will
definitely
revisitwould
love
to
try
this
on
tap
highly
recommend
overall
my
vote
would
be
to
rate
this
up
there
with
the
best
of
them
pallet
differences
aside
for
anyone
who
likes
porterstouts
and
a
great
ipa
this
is
for
you
hands
down
the
best
black
ipas
ive
ever
had
thank
you
stone
brewery
pours
dark
and
black
in
the
glass
good
head
at
pour
at
least
a
finger
and
a
nice
off
white
color
and
good
retention
solid
spider
web
lacing
aroma
is
hoppy
yet
presence
of
malts
even
on
nose
sweet
bitter
and
a
hint
of
roast
flavor
is
equally
impressive
with
malts
present
up
front
and
malts
showing
more
towards
the
back
extremely
well
balanced
beers
body
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
in
weight
with
fairly
light
to
mediumlight
levels
of
carbonation
the
result
is
a
fairly
smooth
beer
with
a
hefty
body
resulting
in
a
full
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
closes
out
expectedly
dry
with
longlingering
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
residual
sweetness
around
the
lips
o
buy
it
and
try
it
if
you
like
stouts
and
ipas
then
this
seems
to
be
the
perfect
combo
o
im
really
disappointed
its
only
okay
instead
of
mindblowing
like
its
sorely
missed
big
brother
im
thinking
maybe
oldish
bottle
but
the
stone
15th
i
had
was
6
months
old
and
it
still
blew
me
away
to
be
fair
that
was
clearly
more
malt
driven
so
ill
try
this
again
fresh
or
maybe
on
tap
o
a
good
showing
from
stone
i
would
not
have
any
issues
with
enjoying
one
another
day
pours
dark
dark
brown
a
bit
of
a
tan
head
and
good
sticky
lacing
smells
of
hops
lots
of
hops
the
hops
give
off
a
citrus
and
pine
aroma
can
also
smell
a
bit
of
roasted
barley
the
taste
is
great
extremely
hoppy
but
there
is
also
some
malty
sweetness
it
is
roasty
yet
the
hops
give
it
a
light
and
refreshing
character
its
like
stones
ipa
but
black
and
roasted
its
great
medium
body
and
carbonation
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
can
understand
why
they
decided
to
brew
it
again
nice
flavors
and
aroma
and
heavy
on
the
bitterness
as
always
for
their
stuff
scent
needs
more
than
just
pine
though
it
is
very
overwhelming
definitely
a
beer
i
would
get
again
if
i
was
looking
for
something
dark
and
bitter
overall
interesting
beer
but
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
i
still
prefer
a
good
stout
or
porter
but
this
would
be
my
first
choice
for
an
ipa
black
or
otherwise
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
the
color
is
almost
pure
black
with
the
most
minimal
notes
of
brown
when
held
to
the
light
there
is
a
tower
or
beige
head
that
leaves
sticky
lacings
all
over
the
glass
the
nose
is
full
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
with
a
dominating
citrus
and
pine
hop
character
very
good
nose
the
taste
is
very
hop
dominant
there
is
lots
of
citrus
hops
grapefruit
and
orange
peel
with
some
resin
a
nice
balance
comes
from
the
roasted
malts
which
even
out
the
palate
very
well
the
palate
is
big
with
a
long
bitter
finish
great
black
ipa
so
much
roast
its
like
an
unsweetened
chocolate
bar
with
west
coast
hops
this
is
not
the
most
extreme
im
looking
at
you
stone
15th
anniversary
escondidian
imperial
black
ipa
but
its
beyond
solid
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
approaches
to
the
black
ipa
massive
flavor
but
manages
a
balance
i
set
this
as
the
benchmark
for
the
style
dark
brown
almost
black
pour
with
a
nice
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smell
is
big
on
roasty
malts
with
a
very
nice
hop
aroma
on
the
back
end
the
taste
grows
on
you
sweet
up
front
bitter
finish
hops
are
blended
perfectly
a
lot
of
flavor
here
great
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
a
hard
style
to
do
but
stone
nailed
this
pours
an
almost
pitch
black
with
thick
off
white
head
and
sticky
lacing
malty
hop
aromas
slight
chocolate
malt
notes
taste
is
very
hop
forward
and
bitter
but
is
well
balanced
with
the
roasted
chocolate
malts
very
thick
and
malty
but
bitter
hoppy
at
the
same
time
its
basically
a
dark
dipa
its
the
first
stone
i
actually
enjoy
and
well
worthy
of
400
excellent
take
on
a
dark
hoppy
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
fuller
body
it
would
almost
seem
like
a
borderline
dipa
with
coloring
added
the
hop
and
malt
characters
are
in
near
perfect
complement
to
each
other
overall
as
expected
its
amazing
this
may
be
my
new
favorite
from
stone
o
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
come
across
yet
a
perfect
balance
of
hoppy
and
dark
roasty
chocolatey
flavors
originally
reviewed

o
excellent
black
ale
dare
i
say
the
de
facto
standard
for
the
style
this
stuff
is
just
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
overall
though
the
label
might
not
say
it
this
is
a
true
black
ipa
and
for
that
i
will
incredibly
commend
it
it
is
complex
tasty
full
of
flavor
and
just
forever
lasting
salud
unique
creation
very
good
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
originally
brewed
for
their
11th
anniversary
in
2007
and
it
is
still
being
brewed
i
must
drink
it
every
year
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
trying
this
beer
thin
tan
head
on
a
black
beer
with
hints
of
red
on
the
perimeter
aroma
is
complex
and
the
taste
is
superb
cheers
overall
i
liked
it
i
though
that
their
15
anniversary
black
ipa
is
way
better
but
this
one
is
still
really
enjoyable
despite
a
mouth
feel
that
does
not
quite
do
the
beer
justice
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
gladly
overall
seek
this
one
out
soon
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
that
dissipates
slowly
leaving
some
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
opaque
but
bubbles
can
be
seen
collecting
on
the
underside
of
the
head
the
hop
aroma
of
this
beer
is
strong
but
i
can
also
pick
up
dark
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
and
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
smell
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
citrus
hop
flavor
is
intense
but
i
can
also
pick
up
the
malty
flavors
as
well
as
bitter
chocolate
and
anise
the
alcohol
is
wellhidden
in
the
flavor
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
to
full
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
this
is
a
most
excellent
beer
that
everyone
should
try
once
o
a
decent
black
ale
worth
a
try
o
the
most
interesting
american
black
ale
i
can
remember
having
my
description
probably
didnt
do
the
flavor
profiles
justice
but
it
was
clear
that
this
was
more
than
a
simple
ipa
with
some
roasted
malt
flavor
thrown
into
the
mix
overall
an
outstanding
beer
basically
a
blend
of
the
sweet
flavors
of
a
belgian
dubbel
with
a
much
higher
hop
bitterness
the
choice
of
the
more
citrusy
hops
was
a
great
idea
because
they
blend
well
with
the
sweetness
its
basically
an
imperial
black
ipa
really
interesting
and
really
good
oi
love
the
hops
and
for
a
dark
ale
it
brings
a
lot
of
subtleties
ive
seen
other
reviews
describe
it
as
a
black
ipa
and
it
fits
the
bill
good
beer
for
a
good
price
stone

i
had
this
on
tap
a
few
months
ago
and
was
disappointed
and
now
im
having
it
again
from
the
bottle
and
i
gotta
say
its
just
as
disappointing
too
much
bitter
pine
character
overruns
the
entire
experience
i
dont
know
if
the
bottle
i
had
initially
was
old
and
the
hops
had
mellowed
to
the
point
that
other
flavors
were
able
to
shine
through
or
if
theres
been
a
change
in
the
brewing
process
but
its
been
a
pure
pine
bomb
the
last
few
times
ive
had
it
my
score
now
reflects
my
latest
assessment
which
is
far
less
favorable
mediumfull
body
with
mild
carbonation
very
smooth
and
creamy
feels
great
and
a
dry
finish
leaves
you
wanting
more
o
my
favorite
black
ipa
so
far
actually
one
of
my
favorite
beers
none
of
the
yucky
cream
cheese
taste
that
seems
to
be
ever
present
in
hops
in
the
dark
and
back
in
black
just
smooth
roasty
malts
and
really
big
citrusy
and
floral
hops
hella
an
outstanding
big
black
ipa
that
sort
of
straddles
the
line
between
styles
pours
a
gorgeous
looking
thick
dark
chocolate
color
with
an
almost
nitrotap
looking
head
on
it
all
creamy
and
white
and
lasting
and
foamy
and
yummy
smells
great
lots
of
hops
synergizing
with
very
dark
roasted
malts
to
produce
an
exceltionally
rich
bitter
character
that
radiates
in
both
the
nose
and
in
the
flavor
there
are
also
subtle
hints
of
vanilla
sweet
spices
and
wood
in
the
flavor
feel
is
awesome
thich
and
velvety
full
bodied
but
sessionable
with
a
very
well
hidden

abv
in
the
end
i
dont
know
why
i
looked
at
this
one
on
the
shelf
for
so
long
before
picking
it
up
i
loved
every
drop
and
will
almost
certainly
purchase
this
again
really
really
good
stuff
here
not
like
any
other
black
india
pales
out
there
o
again
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
like
a
few
reviewers
have
mentioned
already
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
example
of
a
black
ipa
it
has
the
potential
of
a
regular
ipa
yet
also
has
a
really
awesome
roasty
flavor
that
compliments
the
hop
bitterness
ive
had
one
other
black
ipa
from
another
company
so
far
but
i
feel
like
the
roasted
flavor
of
that
beer
dominated
the
hops
with
this
one
though
as
mentioned
above
its
a
perfect
5050
stone
definitely
knows
what
they
are
doing
and
this
one
is
worth
a
try
i
will
have
more
of
these
in
the
future
for
sure
he
body
is
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
a
dry
finish
here
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
out
there
real
enjoyable
usually
i
suspect
dark
beers
of
adding
black
to
make
them
dark
i
dont
have
that
feeling
here
it
numbed
me
so
fast
and
had
me
hating
that
i
took
the
last
sip
o
this
has
always
been
a
favourite
almost
flawless
on
tap
the
beer
pours
a
nice
and
rich
black
with
a
head
that
lingered
for
a
very
long
time
the
beer
had
great
lacing
the
smell
is
a
good
balance
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
a
molasses
like
backbone
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
the
best
part
although
the
appearance
is
quite
nice
too
the
taste
is
a
perfect
balance
of
dark
maltiness
with
a
nice
layer
of
hops
surrounding
it
on
all
sides
the
mf
is
rich
and
creamy
and
very
easy
on
the
palate
this
is
the
prime
example
of
the
black
ipacascadian
dark
ale
style
it
is
hoppy
malty
boozy
and
ever
so
delicious
o
i
really
prefer
levitation
since
im
a
malt
lover
but
ssr
is
a
great
stepping
stone
before
the
explosive
taste
of
ruination
o
very
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorites
from
stone
ive
had
this
ontap
in
the
bottle
and
its

medium

and
mediumfull

with
a
fairly

very
smooth
to

but
is
still
a
sipper
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight
warming
after
the
finish
noticed
overall
this
is
a
delicious
black
ipa
as
expected
big
hop
flavors
with
a
great
balanced
malt
backbone
that
i
usually
prefer
in
black
ipas
o
this
has
given
me
hope
for
the
american
black
ale
style
what
a
combination
of
powerful
hops
and
even
bigger
roasts
its
an
interesting
palate
for
sure
thats
really
the
main
thing
i
like
about
this
beer
that
its
unique
as
are
most
of
stones
offerings
but
as
far
as
dark
hoppy
beers
go
i
think
a
stout
might
be
a
bit
more
satisfying
for
my
tastes
of
course
thats
not
to
say
that
this
beer
doesnt
have
its
place
if
you
really
want
to
see
where
this
one
stands
out
grab
something
salty
garlicy
or
just
plain
spicy
and
crack
a
bottle
the
darkness
will
soothe
your
burn
and
the
hops
will
rile
it
up
at
just
the
right
times
doa
almost
pitch
black
with
a
thick
luscious
tan
head
great
sticking
power
on
the
head
it
never
went
away
the
smell
is
great
with
tons
of
spicy
hops
bursting
through
the
coffeelike
malt
backing
the
flavor
is
fantastic
as
well
giving
off
tons
of
complex
malt
flavor
with
those
citruslike
bitter
and
peppery
spice
notes
that
are
unique
to
the
amarillo
so
good
kinda
snuck
up
on
me
though
one
flaw
the
hops
could
meld
better
into
the
beer
my
first
black
ipa
loved
every
minute
of
it
well
worth
trying
o
such
a
neat
style
one
of
the
first
ive
tried
and
i
really
like
the
black
ipas
this
is
a
standout
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
from
stone
this
was
my
sublimely
awesome
100th
review
mouthfeel
er
not
the
brewers
fault
but
that
presence
on
the
bar
counter
with
only
a
thin
jacket
for
cooling
meant
the
beer
was
virtually
room
temperature
much
too
warm
for
any
beer
never
mind
a
black
ipa
however
making
imaginative
adjustments
for
the
heat
im
giving
high
marks
for
the
beer
that
lurks
within
the
warmth
which
is
a
bitter
hop
delight
if
it
had
been
on
handpump
they
would
have
needed
a
crowbar
to
prise
me
away
this
beer
is
a
black
dense
heady
brew
when
held
to
the
light
its
a
blackishbrown
and
nearly
impenetrable
the
smell
is
fantastic
very
malty
with
a
dark
fruit
and
yeast
scent
vanilla
toasted
wood
and
stone
fruit
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
lot
of
hop
bitterness
malt
forward
soft
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
o
a
different
beer
in
that
strong
flavours
and
delicate
touches
are
combined
o
once
again
stone
has
made
an
incredible
beer
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
ever
had
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
tan
head
that
recedes
to
an
inch
and
is
foamy
lacing
is
sticky
aroma
is
toasted
barley
citrus
coffee
and
light
floral
notes
taste
is
of
toasted
barley
and
light
bittersweet
chocolate
there
is
a
bitterness
that
is
dark
coffee
mixed
with
grapefruit
this
beer
is
a
malt
and
hop
bomb
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
a
slight
bitterness
lingers
this
is
only
my
second
bipa
but
i
think
it
will
be
one
to
judge
others
against
very
good
ok
the
nastiest
beer
i
have
had
since
dogfish
head
indian
brown
ale
the
taste
is
horrible
it
makes
me
want
to
vomit
immediately
and
i
had
to
do
some
serious
meditating
to
get
down
a
few
swigs
however
the
bottle
cap
came
off
easily
so
maybe
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
but
in
my
experience
i
noticed
darker
beers
are
not
for
me
this
is
disgusting
do
not
buy
it
medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
this
was
very
drinkable
i
thought
it
had
lots
of
character
o
great
stuff
im
kicking
myself
for
not
purchasing
more
bottles
while
having
the
opportunity
when
out
of
state
overall
its
not
bad
its
not
the
best
ive
had
from
stone
but
its
still
a
solid
ale
o
i
really
like
this
one
and
i
will
have
to
get
it
again
very
sessionable
and
i
enjoyed
the
flavors
and
the
aroma
overall
definitely
my
favourite
american
black
ale
this
bottle
was
almost
a
year
past
expiration
and
it
still
had
a
great
hoppycitrus
flavour
cant
wait
to
drink
it
again

0
d
average
for
a
below

o
i
have
never

a
brew
from
that
has
been

they
are
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
u
s
this
is
another
example
of
why
unique
hybrid
that
satisfies
both
your
ipa
stoutporter
cravings
really
solid
brew
this
beer
was
not
going
to
be
sold
to
the
masses
originally
but
the
employees
loved
it
so
much
they
had
to
share
their
passion
with
everyone
thank
you
stone
brewing
truly
a
work
of
art
a
very
good
beer
and
the
best
american
black
ale
that
ive
had
for
a
while
personally
i
wish
that
this
came
in
a
6pack
o
a
great
balck
ipa
really
delicious
and
well
balanced
everything
i
had
hoped
this
brew
would
be
ill
pick
it
up
again
in
a
heartbeat
all
i
can
taste
is
the
hops
and
im
not
a
fan
of
these
particular
hops
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
fact
that
this
is
a
quality
beer
but
i
dont
care
for
it
much
as
a
side
note
this
was
first
brewed
in
2007
as
the
stone
11th
anniversary
ale
o
overall
a
world
class
beer
not
a
perfect
5
but
close
o
kind
of
like
if
a
porter
and
ipa
had
a
baby
not
trying
to
be
anything
other
then
a
good
beer
i
understand
why
they
brought
this
one
back
overall
a
nice
beer
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
a
good
representation
of
this
style
overall
very
happy
with
this
beer
i
definitely
will
be
purchasing
more
bottles
poured
into
a
gulden

starts
with
nice

then
melds

flavor
a
fabulous
flavor
progression
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
very
nicely
done
and
delicious
o
american
black
ale
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
the
gold
standard
in
my
opinion
i
often
find
beers
of
the
style
to
either
favor
the
roasted
and
smoked
or
ipa
side
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
so
perfectly
balanced
that
i
have
no
complaints
stone
sometimes
underwhelms
me
but
this
is
an
amazing
beer
alcohol
what
alcohol
the
strong
flavors
mask
the
8
7
beware
the
one
downside
here
is
drinkablity
both
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
and
the
overwhelming
flavors
i
wouldnt
consider
it
a
session
beer
o
not
my
favorite
stone
creation
but
its
no
doubt
another
unique
creation
for
the
lineup
they
call
it
an
ale
i
call
it
a
bitter
porter
this
is
a
very
appealing
well
crafted
beer
stone
fing
rules
it
really
pushes
the
bounds
of
what
my
palate
is
used
to
while
at
the
same
time
being
fairly
easy
to
handle
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
o
my
favorite
of
this
style
so
far
i
will
drink
again
and
recommend
overy
good
beer
they
used
really
good
hops
for
the
flavor
and
aroma
of
this
beer
the
only
thing
it
is
missing
to
me
is
a
bit
more
malt
flavor
just
a
hint
of
it
though
overall
though
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
am
highly
enjoying

one
of

a

anything

stout
or
porter
like
dances
right
on

truley
awesome

with
a

that
settles
to
a

is
of
roasted

taste
is
of

and
pine
hops
caramel

this
is
a
good
beer
though
there
are
cdas
that
i
enjoy
at
the

level
o
i
am
in
love
with
this
beer
it
is
the
best
black
i
have
had
to
date
if
anybody
can
get
their
hands
on
stone
15th
escondidian
i
would
love
to
work
a
trade
for
it
pours
a
very
dark
red
almost
black
smell
is
extremely
hoppy
i
swear
when
i
opened
the
bottle
the
sweet
sweet
bitterness
exploded
out
underneath
the
cap
and
my
whole
room
smelled
like
hoppiness
nice
thick
head
in
the
glass
taste
is
medium
to
full
bodied
hop
heads
delight
with
some
smokiness
flavor
coming
through

goes
down

easy
for
a

abv
fantastic
beer
will
definitely
be
picking
this
up
again
when
i
need
a

p
a

some
dark
i
p
as
tend
to
be
overly
roasted
or
overly
bitter
selfrighteous
lives
up
the
name
by
tooting
its

and
truly
displaying
a
wellbalanced
yet
assertively
hopped
and
smokey
beer
a
plus
o
thats
hops
are
overpowering
on
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
just
isnt
very
well
balanced
in
my
opinion
theres
so
much
going
on
in
the
taste
its
like
a
good
burnt
roasty
german
beer
that
fell
into
a
giant
vat
of
american
hops
smooth
chocolatey
goodness
in
the
center
drying
drying
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
warm
alcohol
resiny
very
west
coast
very
stone
delicious
i
will
gladly
spend
the
rest
of
my
night
sipping
and
exploring
the
intricacies
of
this
brew
happy
new
year
peeps
m
great
feel
with
a
medium
body
a
controlled
level
of
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
in
the
mouth
i
get
some
warmth
due
to
the
high
abv
this
is
truly
an
excellent
beer
the
carbonation
is
perfect
so
easy
to
drink
and
it
is
well
balanced
in
the
taste
in
the
aroma
it
lacks
a
little
bit
and
as
it
warms
up
i
dont
get
more
than
that
piney
hops
not
bad
however
not
perfect
either
otherwise
it
is
perfect
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
especially
considering
the
kick
and
alcohol
content
i
want
to
dub
it
an
extreme
session
though
the
bros
already
have
a
different
use
for
that
term
o
had
this
a
few
times
and
its
been
consistently
solid
great
balance
between
the
hop
profile
and
the
malts
moderate
carbonation
with
a
lingering
cocoa
and
roasted
malt
bitterness
overall
a
very
intense
and
interesting
beer
with
lots
of
depth
would
drink
again
this
brew
is
consistent
through
all
five
categories
overwhelmingly
so
in
that
regard
and
damn
great
because
of
that
just
pitch
blackness
when
held
up
to
light
smells
of
licorice
coffee
tobacco
must
the
taste
follows
the
appearance
which
follows
the
smell
mouthfeel
follows
the
aforementioned
just
big
robust
roasty
overall
just
wonderful
big
american
dark
ale
another
angry
one
from
stone
loaded
with
layers
of
flavor
just
try
it
o
a
wonderful
beer
one
of
the
few
i
like
of
this
style
notes
im
simplifying
and
probably
need
to
do
a
side
by
side
taste
it
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
their
anniversary
ale
with
a
softer
edge
not
meaning
that
this
one
is
short
of
character
quite
the
contrary
regretting
the
times
i
overlooked
it
that
is
for
sure
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
this
is
sort
of
a
lesser
cousin
to
the
stone
15th
black
ale
that
said
it
cant
be
faulted
at
all
it
offers
more
drinkability
than
the
15th
and
somewhat
less
of
a
medicinal
aspect
what
can
i
say
i
love
both
stone
has
defined
black
ipa
in
all
its
contradiction
as
a
term
they
bring
the
intense
hop
and
roasted
malt
together
perfectly
in
both
cases
i
had
the
15th
when
it
was
just
a
week
or
so
old
and
i
have
never
experienced
such
a
fresh
hop
blast
again
this
is
similar
but
less
hitest
and
in
your
face
but
not
much
at
all
im
glad
this
is
becoming
a
regular
offering
herbal
hops
with
a
touch
of
a
medicinal
aspect
which
is
rare
and
appreciated
kick
ass
brew
from
a
kick
ass
brewer
get
it
if
you
can
handle
it
another
great
offering
from
stone
this
might
become
a
standard
in
my
collection
great
looking
black
ale
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
ever
had
stone
had
a
tap
takeover
at
one
of
the
local
bars
and
this
was
my
favorite
of
the
6
featured
beers
it
has
fantastic
hoppy
notes
with
a
bittermalty
finish
high
alcohol
content
does
not
pull
through
in
the
flavor
i
would
love
to
enjoy
this
every
day
ill
give
this
left
coast
brew
a
hard
fought
but
well
deserved
a
for
my
tastes
racer
5
is
my
standard
for
ipas
o
this
is
a
solid
beer
very
interesting
and
worth
drinking
again
and
again
another
solid
effort
from
stone
12
oz
into
a
snifter
big
black
beer
with
the
head
of
an
ipa
if
darker
for
the
malt
beneath
it
plenty
of
lacing
tons
of
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
dryness
to
them
moreso
than
in
a
big
paler
ipa
loads
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
tongue
with
some
smoky
aftertones
cheers
to
stone
for
making
a
very
interesting
beer
in
a
style
that
doesnt
come
in
six
packs
why
arent
black
ipas
more
popular
at
least
most
of
the
brewers
who
decide
to
make
one
know
what
theyre
doing
mouthfeel
is
excellent
and
i
recommend
trying
this
beer
o
really
great
beer
dominated
by
more
maltyroasted
characteristics
rather
than
strong
hops
overall
surely
a
sublimely
self
righteous
ale
great
brew
if
i
were
the
one
to
make
the
call
to
bring
this
brew
into
the
year
round
schedule
i
would
have
done
the
same
great
brew
o
i
believe
this
is
one
of
stones
best
foundation
beers
it
has
a
great
body
the
appearance
is
what
i
expect
from
this
beer
and
it
is
something
i
could
never
get
enough
of
o
i
have
yet
to
drink
a
beer
from
stone
i
dont
enjoy
and
this
is
another
home
run
a
hopheads
dream
and
complex
yet
easy
to
drink
o
very
nicely
done
hop
heads
wont
be
disapointed
o
a
great
beer
i
enjoy
strong
sweet
stouts
and
sharp
crisp
belgianesque
pales
and
this
beer
hovers
tentatively
between
the
two
styles
oel
delicioso
i
really
dig
this
one
awesome
for
my
first
black
ale
d
tasty
and
probably
the
most
wellknown
aba

a

though
i
think
the
roasted

were
left
in

oven
just
a
bit
too
long
or
something
like
that
anyway
otherwise
good
stuff
o
quite
an
excellent
brew
a
bit
more
focused
and
balanced
than
the
escondidian
im
quite
jubilant
that
they
continued
to
brew
this
great
drink
when
you
let
this
beer
warm
a
bit
it
does
make
it
a
lot
more
drinkable
and
thus
a
lot
more
pleasurable
my
recommendation
is
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
consuming
after
it
warming
up
a
bit
it
was
delicious
beyond
my
expectations
but
cold
not
no
so
much

victory

black
black
ale
that
is

one
of
my
very
favorite
beers
in
the
nose
roast
and
bready
malt
base
that
supports
a
clean
and
crisp
hop
spice
the
nose
continues
into
the
taste
and
matches
exactly
no
surprises
but
maybe
thats
what
disappoints
some
but
i
like
the
roast
and
spice
in
perfect
balance
bit
more
roast
in
the
taste
than
the
nose
my
wife
is
not
a
hop
head
at
all
but
likes
this
beer
because
the
hops
blends
and
compliments
so
well
into
the
sweet
malt
roast
incredible
beer
that
is
one
of
stones
best
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
have
heard
good
things
from
others
that
arent
fans
pours
black
as
night
but
the
head
shrinks
fast
and
is
a
bit
thin
smell
is
sublime
sweet
tangy
grapefruit
with
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
and
toffee
the
main
reason
i
usually
dont
like
the
style
is
because
the
chocolate
malts
overpower
the
rest
but
seems
more
into
the
ipa
zone
the
citrusy
notes
come
through
as
more
of
an
orangelemon
zest
and
this
beast
is
bitter
as
hell
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
i
think
i
finally
found
one
in
this
style
i
finally
like
carbonation
is
spot
on
as
well
as
the
downplayed
alcohol
although
there
is
a
touch
of
heat
being
only
a
month
old
probably
helps
too
review
addition
on
12813
i
had
an
11th
anniversary
bottle
version
of
sublimely
self
righteous
and
the
hop
character
carried
surprisingly
well
over
the
last
6
years
the
review
is
otherwise
similar
o
interesting
and
good
but
not
my
style
not
a
bad
beer
to
end
the
night
would
definitely
give
it
another
chance
o
what
can
i
say
on
tap
more
of
a
black
ipa
flavor
and
smell
in
the
bottle
not
feeling
black
ipa
as
much
but
still
damn
good
like
i
said
either
way
you
wont
be
disappointed
the
beer
is
strong
and
full
of
flavor
it
got
me
interested
in
stone
again
not
a
dig
on
stone
they
know
what
theyre
doing
and
produce
good
beers
however
its
been
awhile
since
i
sought
them
out
nice
work
great
black
ipa
best
thing
ive
had
from
stone
brewery
its
about
time
with
all
the
hype
not
going
to
go
in
detail
too
much
on
this
one
look
good
feel
was
great
smell
hits
your
nose
hard
with
a
smooth
finish
on
the
palet
you
gotta
try
it
for
yourself
cautionhop
heads
only
and
maybe
some
stout
lovers
im
digging
this
from
the
getgo
what
a
surprisea
hoppy
dark
beer
funny
thing
is
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
a
cascadian
ipa
because
ive
had
this
beer
beforewhen
it
was
called
stone
11but
the
hop
aroma
still
took
me
off
guard
the
beer
itself
pours
a
lot
like
a
foamy
cola
its
dark
dark
dark
brown
with
a
good
halfinch
of
loose
bubbly
foam
lingering
atop
after
a
few
minutes
and
a
vigorous
pour
think
pine
more
than
citrus
with
just
a
hint
of
dark
roasted
malt
on
the
nose
some
grapefruit
smells
wonderful
tastes
fantastic
surprisingly
fullbodied
but
not
heavy
and
distinct
enough
for
me
to
not
raise
my
everpresent
questions
about
the
black
ipa
styles
similarities
to
a
hoppy
porter
bit
of
a
resiny
chew
to
this
enough
to
let
the
flavors
linger
but
not
to
the
point
where
i
find
it
disagreeable
hops
mix
with
a
little
roast
in
a
wonderfully
delicious
combination
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
unique
name
fits
its
character
stone
brewery
strikes
again
deeprich
in
color
perfect
exagerrated
biterness
small
head
but
heavy
lacing
malty
and
all
around
well
balanced
two
of
these
you
will
be
alright
lol
dont
drive
poured
the
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
very
freely
which
resulted
in
a
two
finger
mocha
colored
head
that
dies
down
rather
quickly
but
leaves
tons
of
lacing
behind
taste
and
smell
are
one
in
the
same
with
this
beer
both
consist
of
roasted
malts
pine
and
citrus
hops
the
only
difference
between
the
two
is
that
the
nose
would
suggest
tons
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
however
the
roastieness
from
the
malts
balance
this
one
out
mouthfeel
was
not
what
i
expected
there
is
a
nice
smooth
creamyness
to
this
that
was
unexpected
but
there
was
a
slight
bitter
dryness
that
reminded
me
this
was
a
stone
ale
not
a
porter
o
cant
say
enough
get
this
one
if
you
still
havent
had
it
mouthfeel
is
good
very
dry
very
creamy
even
though
its
not
my
favourite
type
of
beer
i
really
appreciate
it
overall
its
very
well
done
creamy
and
full
on
the
palate
and
it
leaves
a
sticky
resinous
film
after
the
finish
a
little
bit
of
warmth
as
the
beer
approaches
room
temperature
too
i
like
this
one
a
lot
very
happy
this
wasnt
a
1anddone
but
instead
is
now
a
standard
offering
22
oz
bomber
poured
in
pint
glass
burnt
malt
aroma
resin
chocolate
citrus
pitch
black
with
frothy
brown
head
and
good
lacing
very
bitter
medium
sourness
like
pineapple
and
grapefruit
with
some
syrup
full
body
creamy
sticky
soft
carbonation
bitter
long
finish
maybe
the
finest
brew
ive
had
overall
it
is
a
great
beer
i
am
impressed
o
black
ipas
are
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
me
this
is
the
best
one
ive
tried
to
date
appearance
is
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
head
very
nice
lacing
really
interesting
powerful
and
complex
aroma
has
hints
of
pine
flower
petals
figs
and
a
smokiness
the
flavor
is
excellent
with
the
hop
and
fig
flavor
dominating
toffeechocolate
and
something
similar
to
a
porter
or
rauchbier
in
the
background
not
overpowering
in
the
hop
body
or
alcohol
depts
highly
recommended
i
am
liking
this
black
ipa
style
more
and
more
this
is
worth
seeking
out
if
you
feel
worthy
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tried
excellent
contexture
well
balanced
flavors
smoky
caramelly
coffe
and
chocolaty
o
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
black
ipas
yet
as
i
havent
tried
many
but
this
is
a
decent
offering
and
probably
the
best
i
have
tried
so
far
from
this
style
o
not
bad
i
wish
the
malts
came
through
a
little
more
and
the
flavors
dont
hold
up
very
well
in
the
finish
but
a
grew
brew
for
sure
crossposted
on
httpbooksbitesbrews

com
overall
a
decent
offering
and
a
good
beer
on
a
fresh
autumn
evening
dr
incredibly
drinkable
for
the
abv
which
itself
is
cleverly
hidden
its
priced
right
at
least
in
california
and
though
it
lacks
complexity
id
certainly
have
it
again
particularly
if
i
found
it
on
draught
a
nice
offering
from
stone
that
every
beer
fanatic
should
try
i
rated
it
a
bit
loer
than
i
should
have
maybe
judging
it
as
what
i
really
wanted
which
was
an
aipa
but
is
it
one
i
that
would
happily
repeat
i
am
looking
forward
to
finishing
the
large
and
expensive
bottle
o
i
have
always
found
this
beer
to
be
like
a
roasted
more
alcoholic
arrogant
bastard
i
enjoy
it
every
once
in
a
while
but
its
not
in
my
regular
rotation
like
many
other
stone
offerings
it
is
a
really
interesting
beer
to
me
though
the
hop
bitterness
and
roasted
malt
interaction
is
cool
i
dont
find
the
beer
as
bitter
as
the
ibus
testify
i
wonder
if
this
beer
is
best
fresh
i
wonder
if
aging
this
in
oak
barrels
would
be
beneficial
in
bringing
out
some
flavor
i
definitely
find
it
too
heavy
on
the
alcohol
in
scent
and
taste
o
for
real
stone
i
am
so
glad
that
it
was
you
who
popped
my
craft
beer
cherry
if
you
havent
yet
had
this
black
ale
than
i
suggest
you
go
out
and
get
one
truly
remarkable
o
lots
of
flavor
and
a
high
dosage
of
hops
are
sure
to
make
this
a
pleaser
very
enjoyable
on
tap
or
in
the
bottle
though
i
would
say
on
tap
the
hops
come
out
a
bit
more
and
it
tasted
a
lot
more
fresh
and
poignant
very
enjoyable
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
more
than
one
as
it
fills
you
up
quickly
if
you
like
dark
roasted
brews
and
are
a
fan
of
hops
this
one
is
for
you
cheers
overall
this
is
a
very
much
quality
brew
from
a
style
that
i
do
like
great
hop
profile
that
drives
a
great
dry
yet
malty
brew
it
has
a
right
to
be
selfrighteous
it
may
in
fact
be
sublime
all
i
know
is
that
if
im
browsing
at
my
local
craft
beer
store
four
firkins
and
i
see
fresh
selfrighteous
ill
be
hardpressed
not
to
grab
it
cheers
o
one
of
my
personal
favorites
never
gets
old
and
arguably
one
of
stones
finest
the
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
name
says
it
all
do
yourself
a
favor
and
add
this
one
to
your
list
very
deep
brown
near
black
2

lightish

med

medium

well

and

very
nice
black
ale
hits
the
mark
for
me
awesome
to
drink
it
has
that
signature
stone
hoppiness
that
i
just
cant
get
enough
of
the
darker
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
really
finish
it
nicely
i
wonder
how
similar
this
will
be
to
the
black
ipa
that
stone
is
just
putting
out
now
gotta
love
the
commentary
on
the
back
of
the
bottle
especially
the
third
paragraph
overall
yet
another
beautiful
american
beer
a
twist
to
the
direction
usually
perceived
by
me
from
stone
and
certainly
its
most
original
and
tasty
one
i
never
cease
to
be
amazed
with
the
brews
of
the
states
o
probably
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
another
well
done
beer
done
by
stone
i
think
one
bomber
of
this
will
hit
the
spot
nicely
this
one
had
been
in
my
fridge
for
about
a
month
so
may
have
lost
a
little
of
that
hop
bite
stone
is
so
well
known
for
this
beer
is
a
big
hop
bomb
that
has
a
sweet
slightly
roasty
balance
the
hop
aroma
and
kick
are
fantastic
like
most
stone
beers
o
overall
a
good
black
ipaale
with
the
bitterness
id
expect
from
stone
worth
checking
out
for
sure
overall
great
stuff
ill
be
watching
out
for
this
one
again
overall
this
beer
is
excellent
as
an
ipa
lover
who
is
trying
to
branch
out
into
some
of
the
darker
brews
this
is
the
perfect
gateway
beer
yes
this
is
a
hybrid
style
that
really
works
and
i
expect
ill
be
adding
it
to
my
lineup
of
regular
goto
brews
well
done
stone
d
from
what
i
have
had
of
the
style
this
is
pretty
much
the
hallmark
its
not
just
an
ipa
with
a
dash
of
specialty
malts
its
a
black
ipa
like
the
belgian
ipa
it
is
a
peculiar
style
but
stone
executed
it
as
if
theyd
invented
it
overall
this
was
a
really
good
beer
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
stone
wish
it
stood
apart
from
the
double
bastard
a
little
more
though
overall
the
has
a
very
overpowering
hop
taste
which
made
it
hard
for
me
to
taste
everything
else
it
is
a
good
beer
overall
cheers
a
nice
bitter
finish
ends
a
truly
delightful
beer
will
definitely
purchase
again
whenever
i
get
a
chance
o
one
of
a
handful
of
black
ales
that
ive
tried
very
good
seamless
merging
of
hops
malt
and
sweeter
chocolate
and
caramel
tones
a
must
try
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
would
be
a
go
to
brew
very
nice
one
is
good
for
a
sitting
though
do
certain
beers
due
either
to
timing
or
to
mastery
have
taken
on
the
role
of
archetypal
example
of
their
style
certainly
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
is
the
archetypal
americanbrewed
pale
ale
and
within
its
distribution
range
alaskan
amber
will
always
be
the
defining
americanbrewed
alt
sublimely
selfrighteous
ssr
ale
by
stone
defined
the
archetype
of
the
black
dipawhich
is
i
think
an
important
distinction
to
make
from
the
black
ipa
while
the
style
has
been
popping
up
here
and
there
and
everywhere
with
everincreasing
frequency
this
beer
was
very
accessible
within
stones
distribution
range
before
most
breweries
had
even
discovered
black
ipas
or
dipas
more
hopfocused
than
some
it
is
interesting
in
the
way
that
its
hop
profile
puts
it
closer
to
double
bastard
than
to
the
russian
imperial
stout
it
is
worth
returning
to
occasionally
even
if
it
isnt
your
favorite
black
dipaafter
all
it
set
the
mark
to
which
all
others
are
measured
against
have
had
this
brew
many
times
and
the
consistency
amazes
me
always
the
same
the
beer
pours
black
like
a
stout
with
a
great
lasting
head
the
smell
is
a
hop
explosion
like
an
ipa
with
a
tad
of
sweetness
some
roastyness
and
a
mild
smoke
character
taste
is
absolutly
what
a
black
ipa
should
be
and
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
i
can
taste
candied
hops
perfect
roasted
malt
flavors
and
the
best
part
is
the
coffee
taste
is
minimal
will
continuously
go
to
this
beer
to
get
my
fix
of
dark
malt
as
its
excellent
and
easy
to
get
o
this
beer
grows
on
you
i
like
it
less
coffee
as
time
goes
on
actually
maybe
not
consummately
crafted
great
beer
restores
my
faith
in
stone
overall
fantastic
beer
lives
up
to
the
hype
too
i
could
have
this
stuff
all
the
time
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
dark
ale
replete
with
delicious
bread
and
toasted
nutmalt
flavors
and
begging
to
be
sipped
quietly
in
front
of
a
roaring
fire
only
a
slight
alcohol
tingea
result
of
the
8
7
abvmars
what
is
otherwise
an
excellent
beer
but
even
then
the
alcohol
is
excusable
and
warming
much
like
a
whiskey
or
cognac
o
gotta
say
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
no
exception
ive
heard
some
complaints
about
chalky
mouthfeel
with
this
style
thats
what
makes
it
great
the
bitter
and
resinous
hops
hang
on
the
tongue
for
an
eternity
great
example
of
the
style
thank
you
for
another
great
beer
to
review
stone
o
a
great
beer
wish
stone
would
distribute
locally
meanwhile
road
trips
can
bring
it
home
delicious
stuff
o
a
perfectly
drinkable
black
ale
for
a
warm
evening
insofar
as
it
offers
the
great
combination
of
roasted
flavor
but
the
drinkability
of
a
hoppy
ipa
overall
i
found
this
a
damn
good
brew
it
was
my
first
black
ale
and
i
was
certainly
impressed
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
surprising
mouthfeel
and
the
great
balance
the
first
thing
noticed
at
the
very
first
sip
was
how
soft
the
feel
was
for
this
style
it
is
easy
to
produce
a
watery
beer
with
little
substance
but
they
seemed
to
retain
a
good
deal
of
body
after
which
the
hops
were
added
as
a
secondary
feature
this
made
for
a
nice
balance
which
allowed
for
no
component
to
really
obtrude
the
other
btw
this
beer
tastes
uncommonly
good
with
peanuts
this
beer
is
amazing
looks
like
a
stout
tastes
like
an
ipa
you
have
to
try
it
oof
the
black
ipas
that
ive
tried
this
now
tops
my
list
knocking
21st
amendments
back
in
black
to
second
fiddle
if
you
like
or
are
interested
in
this
style
of
beer
look
no
further
let
this
one
warm
as
this
is
a
complex
concoction
that
should
be
enjoyed
at
or
above
cellar
temperatures
to
elicit
all
of
the
flavors
o
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
has
a
very
unique
profile
that
leaves
your
mouth
wanting
more
of
the
bitterness
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
but
am
not
thinking
i
would
ever
crave
this
beer
and
have
to
have
it
now
big
hop
slap
in
the
mouth
bitter
domination
pine
leads
the
way
and
outshines
all
else
it
is
followed
by
some
bitter
grapefruit
it
gets
slightly
biscuity
towards
the
end
but
not
enough
to
add
any
sweetness
this
beer
is
all
bitter
hoppy
but
it
is
good
damn
good
overall
im
giving
this
a
4
5
right
now
mainly
because
i
drank
it
thinking
it
was
going
to
be
hoppy
and
that
it
was
at
least
90
degrees
in
my
kitchen
this
would
be
an
amazing
late
fall
or
winter
beer
but
midjuly
ill
stick
to
my
ipas
and
keep
this
cellared
for
a
few
months
a
really
nice
black
ale
lots
of
flavour
with
a
great
hoppiness
solid
a
great
example
of
a
black
ipa
well
worth
drinking
if
you
ever
have
the
chance
to
purchased
at
total
wine
more
for
6
99
which
is
a
solid
price
i
think
i
may
revisit
this
one
a
while
from
now
coal
black
and
a
nice
head
with
excellent
lacing
smell
is
toasty
malt
with
some
espresso
taste
is
of
roasty
malts
with
some
sweetness
and
a
hop
bitterness
coffee
dark
fruit
oak
astringency
juniper
grapefruit
this
is
a
unique
and
complex
ale
that
drinks
like
a
combination
of
styles
mouthfeel
is
creamy
thick
and
sticky
with
good
carbonation
aftertaste
is
clean
and
bitter
seems
like
a
black
ipa
taste
comes
off
as
extremely
bitter
to
me
im
gonna
have
to
come
back
to
this
later
overall
one
of
the
standout
examples
of
the
nebulous
black
ipa
style
which
makes
sense
as
it
was
one
of
the
first
overall
impression
and
stone
just
keeps
em
coming
great
black
ale
and
will
be
enjoying
this
one
again
very
soon
it
almost
reminds
me
of
a
black
ipa
but
not
hoppy
enough
for
this
style
great
price
for
this
beer
as
well
this
was
an
excellent
beer
and
i
definitely
plan
to
revisit
this
beer
has
a
nice
look
its
mostly
black
with
some
dark
brown
edges
where
the
light
gets
through
with
a
brown
head
which
leaves
good
lazing
and
has
good
retention
the
hops
are
the
strongest
smell
with
the
roasted
malts
and
some
alcohol
smells
this
has
a
medium
thickness
the
taste
is
mostly
of
bitter
hops
to
a
lesser
extent
there
are
some
roasted
malts
and
a
molasses
taste
but
they
are
overpowered
by
the
hops
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
ill
continue
to
buy
again
but
from
the
few
american
black
ales
ive
tried
i
actually
prefer
hop
in
the
dark
to
this
one
i
think
its
better
balanced
between
being
very
hoppy
and
having
flavorful
roasted
malts
still
this
is
a
great
beer
final
thought
not
an
everyday
but
as
aggressive
this
beer
is
and
at
almost
9
this
one
should
be
had
every
month
if
you
havent
had
it
on
tap
get
ready
for
a
taste
bud
chubby
a
decent
two
finger
creamy
tan
head
not
a
lot
of

present
midnight
black
completely
solid

creamy
mouthfeel
chocolate
coffee
roasted

dried

dates
bitterness
lingers
smooth
and
creamy
with
low
to
medium
carbonation
o
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
offering
from
stone
the
hops
and
roasted
malt
characteristics
are
expertly
melded
into
a
very
enjoyable
interpretation
of
the
american
black
ale
style
recommended
stones
take
on
a
black
ale
should
be
good
the

fig
also
present
as
with
most
beer
i
have
had
from
this
brewery
the
hops
dont
disappoint
this
is
a
hightest
well
made
beer
it
is
seeing
a
black
ale
through
the
lens
of
a
skillful
westcoast
brewer
very
very
good
sorry
not
much
flowery
description
here
just
my
impressions
on
a
beer
that
sets
a
certain
standard
for
others
like
it
pours
a
thick
three
finger
slightly
tan
head
lacing
coats
the
side
of
the
glass
and
the
beer
itself
is
nearly
pitch
black
with
a
tint
of
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
initial
smell
is
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
but
as
it
warms
a
more
piney
hop
character
and
some
tropical
fruit
are
evident
a
touch
of
alcohol
present
on
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
hopy
with
just
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
and
some
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
one
of
my
favorite
black
ales
would
love
to
see
this
in
4
or
6
packs
great
offering
from
stone
such
a
nice
beer
to
sip
on
this
will
be
a
go
to
for
me
in
the
future
if
i
really
want
a
good
mix
of
hop
and
malt
that
you
can
really
focus
on
either
flavor
and
enjoy
it
all
medium
to
full
bodied
with
average
carbonation
drinks
fairly
well
likely
due
to
its
appearance
tricking
me
into
expecting
a
big
heavy
ris
this
leans
more
toward
the
ipa
end
of
the
spectrum
based
on
what
ive
sampled
of
the
style
thus
far
a
great
option
for
hop
heads
looking
for
a
bit
of
a
change
of
pace
drinking
this
beer
as
well
as
its
aftertaste
you
kinda
get
the
feeling
with
its
milkiness
that
you
are
drinking
a
melted
candy
bar
i
feel
that
ive
taken
a
hersheys
special
dark
chocolate
bar
and
melted
it
in
stone
smoked
porter
swirled
it
around
and
drank
it
down
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
coffee
brown
with
a
nice
foamy
beige
head
that
retained
and
laced
decently
i
really
love
this
style
of
beer
dark
malts
and
dark
fruits
in
the
aroma
but
a
definite
citrus
hop
presence
like
youd
get
from
your
typical
ipa
smooth
dark
malts
in
the
taste
molasses
brown
sugar
quickly
overcome
by
lots
of
citrusy
hops
though
the
maltiness
lingers
on
in
the
background
flavorful
and
mediumbodied
another
highly
drinkable
beer
from
the
consistently
excellent
stone
brewing
co
d
another
great
beer
from
stone
not
an
overally
complex
beer
but
it
goes
down
pretty
smooth
and
if
you
like
a
chocolate
profile
youll
like
this
one
this
beer
pours
dark
dark
brown
with
a
decent
off
white
head
the
smell
is
hops
up
from
floral
and
piney
with
a
burnt
malt
finish
the
flavor
is
pretty
close
to
the
smell
with
the
hops
coming
out
first
followed
by
the
roasted
burnt
malt
flavor
the
beer
is
very
dry
with
no
residual
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
wig
good
carbonation
and
a
bitterness
feel
on
the
side
of
you
tongue
overall
its
a
good
beer
worth
trying
at
least
once
poured
a
3
offwhite
head
which
was
slow
to
recede
dark
walnut
brown
in
color
and
clear
i
think
though
its
so
dark
its
hard
to
tell
smell
is
strong
on
hops
and
citrus
and
id
agree
grapefruit
seems
dominant
taste
matches
the
smell
but
includes
quite
a
bitter
finish
as
is
often
the
case
with
stone
this
is
a
big
bold
beer
with
no
shyness
on
hops
theyre
all
great
but
i
do
think
most
are
just
slight
deviations
from
each
other
or
from
a
central
big
beer
concept
by
stone
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
completely
opaque
black
with
a
light
brown
head
good
lacing
aroma
is
caramel
and
roasted

alcohol
grapefruit
and
grassy

flavor
is
sweet
caramel
and
roasted
malt
grassy
hops
grapefruit
pineapple
raisins
and
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
warming
and
a
fairly
bitter
finish
good
beer
decent
balance
big
offwhite
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
mostly
of
grapefruit
from
the
hops
with
a
little
of
the
dark
roasty
malts
shining
through
tastes
like
a
schwarzbier
with
an
abundance
of
american
hops
and
a
big
bitter
component
ill
definitely
buy
this
one
again
when
i
see
it
narrative
and
stay
out
of
my
room
becca
or
gwendoline
as
she
preferred
to
be
called
in
her
adolescent
epoch
slammed
the
door
of
her
room
the
twilight
posters
swelled
with
a
gush
of
incoming
air
and
tusseled
her
junior
high
school
diploma
on
the
wall
they
dont
understand
my
depth
and
just
because
i
leave
my
leather
bound
poetry
book
out
doesnt
meant
that
she
can
just
read
it
she
fumed
to
herself
she
had
a
bitter
and
dark
note
inside
of
herself
but
she
tried
relentlessly
to
present
herself
in
a
comprehensible
manner
her
acoustic
guitar
collected
dust
in
the
corner
next
to
an
unfinished
paint
canvas
just
beside
her
various
competition
dance
uniforms
the
items
formed
a
confusing
strata
of
personality
layers
ever
weathering
ever
changing
ultimately
her
interpretive
dance
classes
would
alienate
school
and
performer
alike
but
she
would
maintain
her
bitter
cold
dignity
with
calm
poise
o
a
very
good
beer
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
this
excellent
beer
will
appeal
to
hopheads
like
me
as
well
as
those
who
like
big
complex
flavors
although
i
prefer
the
standard
ipas
to
this
variety
i
still
found
this
beer
to
be
quite
tasty
i
would
not
suggest
this
beer
to
someone
new
to
craft
brews
o
another
amazing
brew
from
what
i
consider
the
best
brewery
in
the
world
this
sets
the
bar
as
to
what
a
damn
near
perfect
aba
should
be
and
its
easy
to
get
what
more
can
you
ask
d
very
good
really
exceeds
expectations
i
would
drink
this
again
on
tap
this
stuff
is
outstanding
just
as
it
is
in
bottles
i
dont
always
drink
black
ipas
but
when
i
do
i
make
it
a
stone
sublimely
self
righteous
ale
o
overall
it
is
a
nice
dark
hop
that
is
always
good
to
just
chill
to
ive
had
a
few
black
ales
before
but
this
one
is
black
maybe
just
a
hint
of
amber
around
the
edges
where
the
light
comes
through
pours
with
a
fluffy
three
finger
head
that
recedes
slowly
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
great
a
ton
of
roasty
malt
up
front
with
some
hops
hiding
behind
it
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
the
flavor
as
well
where
the
hops
take
over
a
little
bit
more
and
there
is
a
hint
of
sweetness
as
well
very
smooth
on
the
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bite
of
carb
and
bitters
on
the
aftertaste
i
think
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
from
stone
pours
a
very
deep
mahogany
almost
black
with
about
a
half
inch
fomy
dark
tan
head
lacing
retins
well
and
appears
smooth
aroma
is
of
charred
nuts
raisins
hops
slightly
oaky
and
maybe
a
hint
if
smoke
mouthfeel
is
of
a
medium
body
taste
is
of
all
the
aromas
but
more
earthy
and
almost
grassy
excellent
beer
o
if
this
is
representative
of
the
style
then
im
hooked
the
name
of
this
beer
says
it
all
stone
has
never
let
me
down
and
i
doubt
it
ever
will
buy
this
beer
and
drink
it
now
8
7abv
enjoy
slow
and
steady
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
stone
beers
so
far
very
unique
very
smooth
and
very
enjoyable
if
you
havent
had
it
yet
go
pick
some
up
its
definitely
one
ill
get
again
and
again
color
is
a
rich
ruby
black
seems
a
bit
thin
on
the
tongue
at
first
but
really
rolls
off
nicely
a
nice
head
to
start
with
good
lacing
as
i
work
down
the
glass
i
could
really
drink
a
lot
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
thats
where
the
bitterness
really
pays
off
fell
in
love
with
this
one
the
second
i
opened
the
bottle
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
dark
black
color
with
a
generous
brown
head
on
top
the
lacing
looked
pretty
impressive
as
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
fully
loaded
with
citrusy
hops
and
roasted
malts
the
taste
was
a
collision
of
the
two
battling
it
out
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
overall
its
a
wonderful
beer
i
strongly
recommend
it
o
this
beer
is
deceiving
in
that
judging
by
its
appearance
you
would
expect
a
more
stoutlike
drink
with
a
certain
heaviness
and
stronger
malt
characters
but
in
reality
its
more
or
less
a
great
hopheavy
ipa
that
happens
to
look
like
a
stout
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
admittedly
am
not
that
familiar
with
black
ipas
but
i
cant
imagine
one
being
much
better
than
this
i
recommend
this
beer
to
all
those
who
love
hops
and
to
those
who
are
interested
in
this
beer
style
i
will
certainly
drink
this
beer
again
overall
extremely
good
surprisingly
not
malty
for
how
dark
it
is
extremely
good
hoppy
flavor
overall
ranking
it
on
its
style
i
guess
you
can
say
sublimely
hits
all
the
marks
but
in
reality
this
is
a
style
that
doesnt
do
much
more
than
market
american
ipas
so
it
plays
a
mindfuk
im
not
finding
a
palatable
reason
to
get
this
beer
again
or
sponsor
this
style
overall
very
good
black
ale
or
black
ipa
or
whatever
the
hell
stone
wants
to
call
this
thing
bottom
line
is
that
it
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
drink
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
stone
brew
and
i
have
no
ris
around
i
chose
one
of
the
most
influential
beers
as
my
20th
review
this
beer
really
opened
my
eyes
a
year
ago
poured
a
22
oz
bomber
into
my
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
gorgeous
black
with
a
3
inch
light
tan
head
crazy
amount
of
lacing
smell
is
heavenly
piney
citrusy
hops
with
a
hints
of
chocolate
it
is
amazing
that
they
work
so
well
with
each
other
the
taste
is
similar
with
some
burnt
malts
a
hint
of
booze
in
the
finish
has
a
fairly
thick
body
for
such
a
easy
drinking
high
abv
beer
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
did
the
same
for
black
ipas
as
nirvana
did
for
grundge
music
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
it
gave
me
hope
for
the
style
id
definitely
get
this
again
o
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
definitely
hopforward
with
roastedcoffee
notes
underneath
which
is
how
i
would
prefer
a
black
ipa
o
very
drinkable
much
closer
to
a
stout
at
this
point
its
a
completely
different
beer
than
a
fresh
selfrighteous
a
little
more
dynamic
but
mostly
just
more
powerful
on
tap
and
still
a
good
example
of
this
style
cant
go
wrong
with
it
at
all
poured
from
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
duvel
tulip
this
brew
pours
a
near
black
and
creates
a
huge
foamy
light
tan
head
that
last
forever
and
leaves
tons
of
lacing
aromas
of
bitter
hopspine
and
citrus
fruitsparticularly
grapefruit
greet
the
nose
first
sip
reveals
a
surprising
roasted
malt
character
that
is
nicely
balanced
by
bitter
hops
also
hints
of
bitter
coffeechocolate
and
more
citrus
this
beer
has
a
very
usual
flavor
profile
but
the
flavors
work
together
amazingly
well
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
medium
and
there
is
a
definite
creamy
quality
to
this
beer
the
finish
is
long
and
quite
bitter
and
any
hint
of
alcohol
taste
has
been
completely
masked
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
which
manages
to
blend
flavors
you
would
not
think
would
go
togetherand
does
so
very
well
an
interesting
ale
i
would
gladly
enjoy
again
o
not
being
as
devout
of
a
hophead
i
went
after
this
stone
offering
first
im
sure
pleased
that
i
did
what
a
great
mix
of
flavors
in
this
complex
brew
will
have
another
in
the
future
tremendous
a
privilege
to
have
tasted
and
enjoyed
i
gave
this
a
good
go
for
a
dozen
pintsbomber
bottles
soon
after
it
was
introduced
this
is
an
excellent
american
black
ale
drink
this
was
such
a
welcome
extra
and
completely
unexpected
i
will
have
to
have
the
ssr
to
compare
recipes
if
i
had
access
to
more
11
id
be
happy
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
is
a
new
style
for
me
that
i
am
really
enjoying
out
of
the
few
stones
that
ive
tried
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
overall
while
not
as
impressive
as
the
bottled
version
this
is
still
a
beautiful
black
ale
smooth
drinkable
almost
chuggable
enjoyable
subtly
and
roasty
well
done
but
perhaps
i
expect
more
from
stone
i
got
to
experience
this
brew
at
the
11th
anniv
release
before
i
had
ever
even
heard
of
the
black
ipa
or
cascadian
style
dark
ale
i
was
immediately
taken
by
the
hoppiness
and
that
great
balance
or
marriage
of
dark
roasty
malts
here
glad
they
decided
to
make
it
a
regular
one
of
my
fav
stone
offerings
so
far
finish
long
and
full
of
flavor
very
complex
and
explosive
as
well
you
get
the
coffee
and
sweet
malt
balanced
by
the
bite
of
the
hop
finding
this
beer
fresh
is
recommended
great
job
with
this
one
stone
once
i
cracked
this
open
an
aroma
that
made
me
smile
filled
the
air
pours
a
thin
black
that
turns
cola
color
in
the
light
around
the
edges
small
head
but
some
even
lacing
smell
is
bitter
but
not
of
hops
initially
slightly
burnt
grainy
malts
and
molasses
lead
into
some
earthy
hops
grass
spruce
and
citrus
peel
taste
is
so
weird
in
a
good
way
jumps
back
and
forth
from
malts
to
hops
to
malts
to
hops
and
back
after
is
sits
a
bit
the
finish
is
a
nice
roasted
coffee
bean
flavor
a
bigger
beer
at
8
7
but
this
is
pretty
thin
and
very
easy
to
consume
alcohol
is
hidden
behind
all
the
changing
pieces
as
it
doesnt
know
what
to
be
one
drink
a
malt
beer
next
is
ipa
excellent
beer
from
stone
should
we
be
surprised
overall
this
is
probably
my
favorite
stone
brew
to
date
its
got
depth
and
the
profile
holds
up
against
most
ales
if
you
see
this
buy
it
smile
and
then
dont
forget
to
smile
while
you
savor
the
flavor
of
this
behemoth
o
i
can
see
why
this
one
is
among
the
best
not
my
favorite
aba
but
i
would
argue
better
crafted
than
my
favorite
aba
mad
river
serious
madness
this
one
is
easily
had
year
around
has
the
best
body
ive
had
in
the
style
and
comes
from
a
reputable
brewery
with
their
eyes
on
qa
to
say
that
ive
been
looking
forward
to
this
beer
is
an
understatement
one
of
my
buddies
happened
to
pick
this
up
in
denver
last
year
but
he
of
course
didnt
share
22
ounce
bomber
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
goblet
comes
out
of
the
bottle
dark
brown
think
cola
with
a
frothy
long
lasting
tan
head
wish
the
head
was
a
bit
thicker
but
the
high
abv
probably
makes
that
difficult
aroma
comes
across
as
this
dank
and
earthy
hop
character
with
big
notes
of
pine
its
huge
roasted
grain
and
chocolate
are
buried
in
the
nose
you
have
to
work
your
way
past
the
incredible
hop
aroma
but
theyre
in
there
then
theres
the
whole
matter
of
taste
hops
shatter
the
palate
first
with
a
prolonged
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
first
taste
is
all
hops
as
you
acclimate
youll
be
able
to
start
to
pick
at
the
malt
profile
a
bit
more
but
the
first
taste
is
jarring
i
like
the
mouthfeel
as
well
its
slick
and
despite
all
the
hops
never
gets
sticky
this
beer
finishes
very
dry
something
ive
noticed
with
most
stone
beers
as
the
malt
character
never
goes
overboard
into
sweet
territory
instead
it
opts
for
roasted
and
nutty
with
a
slight
bitter
coffee
note
thats
not
the
best
description
let
me
put
it
this
way
ive
toasted
pine
nuts
getting
them
to
the
point
where
theyre
almost
too
dark
and
thats
what
this
malt
flavor
reminds
me
of
its
not
burnt
but
is
right
there
on
the
edge
theres
also
some
definite
alcohol
warmth
but
im
not
picking
up
any
fusels
in
the
nose
or
taste
very
impressive
its
not
often
that
i
find
a
beer
that
lives
up
to
my
expectations
when
trying
it
but
sublimely
selfrighteous
does
that
and
then
some
not
sure
if
its
possible
but
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
an
emerging
style
d
this
was
a
crowd
pleaser
in
our
clan
all
the
beer
geeks
really
enjoyed
this
brew
22oz
bottle
pours
a
virtually
black
color
with
a
12
inch
of
brown
head
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
chocolatey
and
boozey
some
coffee
and
only
a
bit
of
hops
taste
is
of
piney
and
floral
hops
maybe
some
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
but
they
are
certainly
in
the
background
the
hops
are
the
main
focus
here
this
one
smelled
boozey
but
taste
wise
there
isnt
a
lot
of
alcohol
flavor
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
and
certainly
does
taste
like
a
stone
overall
i
dig
it
and
will
grab
it
again
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
id
had
not
interesting
enough
to
justify
the
high
alcohol
by
volume
and
too
strong
to
drink
as
a
refresher
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
ales
ive
had
in
a
long
time
drink
it
it
goes
down
wonderfully
this
is
a
nicely
hopped
black
ipa
the
toasted
malt
taste
does
just
enough
to
offset
the
hops
watch
that
8
7
abv
overall
a
great
dark
ipa
and
another
great
job
by
stone
if
you
like
dark
hoppy
beers
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
then
this
one
pours
a
wateryblack
color
with
a
hint
of
caramel
color
smell
is
typical
stone
hops
with
sweettangy
citrus
the
taste
is
bitter
hops
upfront
with
a
vast
array
of
floral
blended
flowers
is
the
best
way
to
describe
it
but
it
totally
works
another
great
beer
by
a
great
brewery
go
out
and
get
this
i
can
count
the
black
ales
ive
had
on
one
hand
and
one
of
those
was
my
own
homebrew
from
before
i
realized
the
style
existed
already
ssr
is
the
first
ive
had
that
distinguished
itself
by
what
it
wasnt
its
not
just
fistfulls
of
ipa
style
hops
roasted
malts
theres
actually
a
3rd
character
element
here
as
if
its
a
step
in
the
styles
evolution
me
likes
a
must
another
horrible
offering
from
this
company
they
have
one
more
chance
with
me
their
ris
hopefully
that
is
good
as
it
stands
right
now
if
stone
was
giving
me
free
beer
i
wouldnt
bother
drinking
any
of
it
mfdk
medium
bodied
and
lightmedium
to
medium
bodied
a
bit
of
spiciness
from
the
alcohol
and
a
long
lingering
astringency
from
the
alcohol
fair
but
not
one
ill
be
tapping
again
soon
overall
this
is
good
no
doubt
but
personally
id
opt
for
a
good
ol
stone
ipa
with
a
touch
more
brightness
maybe
this
is
more
of
a
wintertime
brew
for
me
cuz
the
darkness
is
vast
oppressive
and
soulcrushing
its
something
that
can
come
from
no
one
but
stone
a
very
good
beer
you
should
try
it
delicious
if
you
like
big
beers
a
must
if
you
appreciate
stones
other
offerings
othis
is
a
truly
exceptional
brew
and
a
definite
repeater
overall
a
wellbalanced
ale
with
lots
of
interesting
subtleties
that
indulged
all
of
the
senses
i
will
definitely
be
looking
for
this
one
again
c
at
best
had
i
been
at
home
this
one
would
have
ended
as
a
drain
pour
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
a
slightly
aboveaverage
carbonation
level
this
goes
down
easily
even
though
its
definitely
not
a
beer
you
can
drink
fast
overall
this
is
an
impressive
brew
glad
i
picked
it
up
something
ill
have
to
pickup
again
soon
this
is
a
complex
and
excellent
example
of
this
new
style
not
the
best
ive
had
but
certainly
an
appropriate
and
enjoyable
example
that
i
would
have
again
a
very
nice
cda
the
nose
reveals
a
touch
of
burnt
malt
along
with
a
heartier
serving
of
roast
and
a
ton
of
pine
needle
and
grapefruit
hop
aromas
fresh
bold
and
inviting
taste
is
more
of
the
same
a
touch
less
chocolate
and
a
touch
more
roast
would
send
it
to
the
top
of
the
class
but
thats
nitpicking
this
is
a
damned
fine
brew
crazy
fresh
hop
flavor
with
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
dryish
finish
that
brings
the
roast
back
into
play
alarmingly
drinkable
at
this
abv
indeed
the
booze
is
barely
noticeable
without
ready
access
to
my
pnw
favorites
this
is
my
goto
for
the
cda
style
this
is
definately
a
beer
ive
been
looking
forwards
to
sample
about
time
we
see
these
good
brews
in
australia
and
it
pours
a
lucious
dark
kola
hue
that
lets
no
light
in
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
head
that
stays
and
leaves
sporadic
clingy
lacingit
has
a
nice
medium
bodied
perfectly
carbonated
mouthfeel
which
feels
ultra
smooth
and
leaves
you
with
tastes
of
piney
hopsboiled
candymandarinmochaa
light
tinge
of
caramelpiney
hopsbitter
milky
coffee
and
on
finish
suprisingly
the
bitterness
is
subdued
by
the
sweet
dark
malt
character
and
overall
a
truly
beautiful
drop
which
really
shows
how
an
aba
should
be
balanced
like
overallnotes
really
good
beer
dont
have
much
of
a
comparison
as
its
my
first
black
ale
but
i
can
say
that
its
fairly
enjoyable
the
strongest
suit
is
its
balance
if
youre
a
hop
head
this
is
for
you
really
strong
hop
presence
and
bitter
well
done
i
experience
this
as
a
sipping
brew
a
beer
to
enjoy
with
time
and
conversation
something
that
warms
with
time
and
actually
improves
upon
its
initial
taste
strong
across
the
board
the
only
thing
that
precludes
a
very
high
rating
is
its
fragrance
and
thats
perhaps
the
most
subjective
of
the
categories
warming
with
a
mediumtofull
body
a
somewhat
sharp
effervescence
that
fades
quickly
and
a
dry
finish
to
end
with
a
good
beer
quite
enjoyable
it
appears
black
ale
means
dark
ipa
fine
with
me
but
a
bit
of
notice
eh
o
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
this
year
so
far
fantastic
brew
o
awesome
glorious
dark
sexy
hoperfection
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
doubt
i
could
identify
it
as
a
black
ale
and
not
an
ipa
whats
the
point
then
overall
theres
lots
to
like
about
this
it
looks
good
and
tastes
good
its
got
good
alcohol
but
nothing
is
offensive
an
interesting
beer
i
really
dont
care
much
for
ipas
so
scored
this
one
a
bit
lower
than
i
might
have
otherwise
still
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
which
scores
points
with
me
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
the
only
thing
keeping
me
from
really
loving
this
is
the
high
hops
content
if
you
are
a
fan
of
hops
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
give
this
one
a
try
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
full
this
beer
is
so
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
i
can
sit
down
with
a
bomber
of
ssra
but
if
im
in
a
mood
for
a
black
ipa
ill
do
some
scouting
for
a
bit
of
a
better
representation
overall
this
may
overtake
my
favorite
american
black
ale
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
its
powerful
and
unique
and
bursting
with
flavor
hard
to
have
anything
else
after
one
of
these
a
very
flavorful
and
interesting
black
ale
hops
have
a
strong
presence
but
do
not
completely
dominate
the
dark
malt
grain
very
nice
pretty
good
black
ipa
stone
certainly
knows
how
to
do
hops
right
well
its
monday
what
the
hell
why
not
have
a
selfrighteous
ale
this
beer
has
awesome
complexity
that
i
would
argue
gave
birth
to
a
whole
new
line
of
craft
beers
the
black
ipas
etc
this
beer
is
very
dark
with
ecru
foamy
head
the
nose
screams
hops
like
an
ipa
the
taste
is
a
wonderment
that
begins
like
an
ipa
but
finishes
with
a
roasty
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
the
abv
can
be
tough
to
start
i
could
probably
handle
two
stingers
22oz
fairly
easily
but
after
that
someone
would
have
to
carry
me
home
finish
bitter
hops
with
subtle
malty
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
heat
o
complex
flavors
with
a
good
feel
nice
beer
for
those
who
like
their
hops
flavors
and
aromas
this
might
rate
as
one
of
my
favorite
stone
beers
an
extremely
well
done
black
ipa
wish
the
price
was
a
little
lower
because
this
drinks
nicely
as
a
session
beer
rather
than
a
sipper
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
for
me
didnt
know
what
to
expect
but
the
dark
color
without
a
ton
of
malt
flavor
and
the
strong
citrus
hop
presence
are
just
right
for
a
black
ipa
quite
tasty
better
balanced
than
many
beers
like
it
and
one
im
quite
likely
to
drink
again
absolutely

a

oh
hops

id
think
this
was
a
dipa
based
on
smell
and
taste
the
finish
had
more
of
a
whiskeylike
burn
on
one
hand
this
is
a
very
hoppy
black
ale
and
has
a
good
blend
of
hops
to
go
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
profile
but
while
i
like
it
im
not
as
in
love
with
it
as
most
it
seemed
a
little
too
strong
on
the
back
end
this
is
still
a
very
good
option
form
stone
pours
a
pretty
nice
one
and
a
half
finger
head
which
is
a
light
brown
color
there
are
some
big
bubbles
and
some
small
creamy
bubbles
the
body
is
black
with
hints
of
dark
brown
here
and
there
especially
when
held
up
to
the
light
the
head
is
still
there
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
overall
this
looks
pretty
good
the
smell
on
this
is
really
surprising
to
me
it
doesnt
really
smell
like
a
black
ale
it
smells
like
a
black
ipa
or
maybe
ever
a
regular
ipa
the
hops
are
just
phenomenal
for
it
being
a
black
beer
i
really
dont
detect
too
much
malt
either
maybe
a
little
bit
but
not
much
its
mostly
just
the
hops
on
the
smell
i
do
get
a
small
indication
of
the
high
alcohol
on
the
smell
overall
it
smells
pretty
good
not
too
complicated
but
it
smells
good
and
powerful
taste
is
really
good
huge
hops
in
the
front
end
and
a
little
malt
in
the
finish
not
too
much
alcohol
noticeable
in
this
one
which
is
nice
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
which
is
ok
for
the
style
but
i
do
like
my
beer
thicker
its
a
very
well
done
beer
which
is
expected
from
stone
but
just
like
the
smoked
porter
its
not
that
complicated
or
unique
if
you
wanted
to
look
up
in
the
dictionary
what
a
good
beer
should
be
you
should
i
dont
know
if
you
would
but
you
should
find
this
beer
listed
on
the
other
hand
if
you
looked
for
creative
beers
in
the
dictionary
this
would
be
no
where
to
be
found
maybe
my
opinion
is
a
little
biased
because
i
recently
had
their
scotch
ale
and
it
was
super
complex
who
knows
we
will
see
if
there
are
any
other
flavors
that
come
out
as
the
beer
warms
but
for
now
i
will
leave
it
as
this
great
beer
not
complex
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pine
resin
grapefruit
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
a
sharp
bitterness
that
hides
most
of
the
malt
character
there
is
also
a
harsh
alcohol
heat
in
the
finish
that
is
unpleasant
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
that
i
could
drink
again
this
is
a
tasty
beverage
that
can
act
as
a
good
introduction
to
this
relatively
young
style
the
fact
that
it
is
available
in
most
states
surely
helps
i
would
pick
up
a
bottle
if
interested
but
i
also
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
obtain
one
if
it
isnt
sitting
on
the
shelves
of
your
local
store
overall
a
very
solid
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
arrogant
bastard
but
a
nice
change
in
pace
overall
an
interesting
beer
that
seems
like
a
mix
of
an
ipa
and
porter
overall
this
is
a
style
that
i
really
like
when
it
strikes
the
proper
balance
between
roasted
malts
and
citrusy
hops
this
one
just
misses
that
balance
but
is
very
good
nevertheless
i
finally
get
to
try
stones
11th
anniversaryssra
since
they
came
to
minnesota
very
good
beer
very
hoppy
but
not
bruisingly
bitter
glad
to
finally
get
to
try
this
one
overall
im
trying
to
wrap
my
mind
around
all
these
new
american
black
ales
that
need
popping
up
on
the
market
i
like
stouts
i
like
ipas
im
still
not
sure
how
much
i
like
this
style
though
if
more
american
black
ales
were
as
good
as
this
one
i
could
see
myself
coming
around
quickly
overall
i
must
say
this
is
fantastic
beer
that
i
am
able
to
purchase
whenever
i
want
lucky
me
o
i
rarely
have
this
beer
because
i
dont
see
it
around
all
that
often
but
i
walked
into
the
store
the
other
day
and
it
was
just
sitting
in
plain
sight
so
i
had
to
grab
one
glad
i
did
stone
is
consistent
and
they
handle
hops
better
than
most
this
is
one
of
the
few
hoppy
black
ales
ive
had
that
i
think
is
more
than
just
someone
jumping
on
the
bus
o
great
beer
easy
to
drink
definitely
for
cda
lovers
overalllove
itits
brand
new
to
st
cloudmn
and
getting
a
good
positive
reaction
overall
the
stickiness
and
resiny
qualities
dominate
the
mouthfeel
and
linger
far
too
long
for
such
a
dark
beer
i
have
had
good
bad
and
average
black
ales
unfortunately
this
is
in
the
bad
dept
because
the
hops
are
just
too
dominating
drinkability
i
could
have
a
couple
over
a
long
night
i
like
the
nice
deep
charred
malt
and
pinemy
favorite
ipa
flavor
one
of
the
better
in
style
yet
i
think
i
would
reach
for
others
in
style
first
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
a
powerful
hopsicle
that
offers
just
a
brief
respite
in
a
caramel
toffee
malt
middle
and
only
continues
along
the
road
to
palate
ruination

cheers
terrific

noted
regarding
the
text
on
the
bottle
blah
blah
blah
get
on
with
it
the
brews
pretty
clear
in
that
theres
lots
of
hues
that
can
come
through
but
its
a
black
body
big
tan
head
still
all
over
the
place
a
bit
of
malt
on
the
scent
but
its
dominated
by
a
massive
hop
profile
as
alvey
at
four
firkins
said
when
he
described
it
the
beer
will
mess
with
your
head
its
a
hop
bomb
but
it
looks
like
a
malt
monster
there
are
nice
sweet
malts
but
the
hop
oil
is
what
this
is
about
much
thinner
bodied
than
a
stoutporter
cool
beer
very
interesting
notes
ssra
is
a
treat
by
any
means
its
medium
body
and
robust
flavor
along
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
make
it
a
beer
that
is
not
only
very
tasty
but
extremely
fun
to
quaff
well
done
i
will
be
buying
this
one
many
times
over
hv
really
supreme
beer
i
dont
even
like
this
style
but
somehow
they
melded
flavors
so
well
here
that
im
really
diggin
drinking
this
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
what
i
love
about
ipas
grapefruit
pine
and
pineapple
i
really
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
this
is
the
first
american
black
ale
that
i
have
been
a
real
big
fan
of
way
to
go
stone
and
welcome
to
minnesota
goodbye
this
is
very
drikable
beer
that
suprised
me
from
the
way
it
looks
and
catagorized
one
of
my
favorites
from
stone
a
slightly
sweet
double
ipa
that
lives
up
to
the
score
a
multitude
of
hop
flavors
with
good
black
malts
behind
it
this
is
on
the
edge
of
being
unbalanced
on
the
hops
side
but
the
malt
comes
through
just
enough
my
only
complaint
is
that
this
is
a
strong
beer
at
8
7
and
i
cant
drink
much
more
than
half
a
bomber
before
i
need
to
switch
to
something
else
still
is
something
id
recommend
anyone
to
try
out
edit
i
started
drinking
this
one
too
cold
it
was
a
bit
more
bitterhoppy
than
i
expected
after
warming
it
a
solid
1015
minutes
in
the
glass
it
became
much
smoother
the
flavors
really
came
alive
with
that
chocolatenutty
background
with
a
smooth
but
strong
hops
flavor
i
adore
at
45
minutes
in
finishing
the
last
third
of
the
22oz
bomber
it
was
simply
phenomenal
i
changed
my
score
above
to
a
9
based
on
this
liquid
amazement
is
what
i
would
have
to
call
this
save
for
the
aroma
being
a
little
on
the
burnt
side
this
black
ipa
is
incredible
smooth
and
thick
this
beer
brings
an
awful
lot
to
the
table
high
on
the
bitters
throughout
the
mouthfeel
its
smoky
mellow
aftertaste
makes
you
completely
forget
that
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
balances
itself
well
out
of
all
the
newish
style
of
black
ipa
that
i
have
had
this
one
is
definitely
the
crown
jewel
congratulations
stone
for
making
another
beer
that
i
find
to
be
so
enjoyable
hops
and
malt
come
through
big
together
dry
and
sticky
from
the
hops
the
hops
follow
the
aroma
and
the
malts
are
a
cocoa
dusted
almonds
dark
and
dry
malts
combined
fruity
sticky
hops
yum
extremely
dark
smooth
body
and
just
enough
head
to
make
this
a
very
good
beer
at
first
try
i
was
surprised
by
the
hoppiness
of
the
beer
as
its
not
a
taste
i
typically
attribute
to
dark
black
beers
quality
of
the
ingredients
definitely
shows
in
this
beer
d
the
alcohol
is
nowhere
to
be
found
this
is
a
great
beer
im
not
sure
that
black
ipa
works
for
me
as
a
style
but
this
transcends
the
style
sublimely
self
righteous
ale
pours
a
dark

of

some

elements
in
the

dry

and
some
light
citrus

sweet

and
some
booziness
nothing
exciting
more
raw
and
strong
flavors
overall
more
of
a
strong
ale
than
a
black
ale
would
like
a
more
pronounced
roasted
malt
flavor
and
less
booze
nonetheless
this
is
an
ass
kicker
pours
black

brown

excellent

mild

excellent
brief
roasted

coffee
toffee
followed
by
that
great
bitterness
both
aspects
are
extremely
smooth
and
meld
together
like
a
piece
of
art
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
medium
body
great
mouth
feel
extensive
hop
and
malt
bitterness
on
the
finish
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
about
as
good
as
it
gets
d
a
solid
black
aleipa
i
wish
there
had
been
a
little
more
roastiness
but
its
not
a
huge
issue
all
around
well
done
on
draft
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
a
bottle
it
continues
to
live
up
to
its
worth
pours
a
murky
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
beige
head
sweet
roasty
caramel
malts
as
well
as
a
load
of
piney
citusy
hops
pretty
complex
malt
versus
hops
but
the
flavors
really
compliment
each
other
great
smooth
body
and
soft
carbonation
long
bitter
finish
delicious
drinkability
very
drinkable
a
real
palate
buster
in
a
good
way
you
wont
want
to
spoil
your
palate
with
another
beer
after
this
one
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
with
average
carbonation
nothing
too
spectacular
on
that
front
im
going
to
pick
it
up
a
bit
in
the
drinkability
department
because
ultimately
i
think
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
brew
though
falls
short
of
world
class
most
do
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
m
smooth
with
a
bitterness
that
doesnt
overpower
from
a
bomber
into
a
wine
goblet
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
firm
pour
yields
a
towering
head
of
brown
foam
with
great
retention
and
clingy
lace
precipitating
carbonation
keeps
the
head
solid
straight
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
great
looking
brew
nose
is
complex
with
sharp
hopscitrus
and
floral
some
malt
but
no
discernable
alcohol
floral
character
overall
in
the
mouth
its
bitterly
hoppy
up
front
with
a
nice
burnt
toast
malty
character
behind
it
strong
hops
presence
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
for
balance
finishing
on
a
bitter
acrid
note
very
nice
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
very
smooth
with
light
carbonation
complementary
of
the
flavor
drinkability
is
very
good
a
bit
stout
for
mass
consumption
but
definitely
an
enjoyable
sipper
overall
this
is
a
complex
and
delicious
brew
and
a
nice
departure
from
standard
orange
ipas
id
definitely
try
this
one
again
high
in
alcohol
and
volume
i
wouldnt
expect
more
than
one
would
not
suffice
unless
youre
a
hophead
and
youd
like
to
get
tanked
not
my
cup
o
tea
conclusion
i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
am
a
card
carrying
fullfledged
hop
head
and
this
beer
may
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
the
main
objections
to
this
beer
are
the
bad
mouth
feel
the
coating
and
aftertaste
after
further
contemplation
i
think
maybe
my
growler
came
from
an
old
barrel
that
was
nearly
empty
my
experience
just
doesnt
come
close
to
what
i
read
about
this
beer
a
fantastic
beer
d
the
beer
goes
down
very
easily
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
in
one
sitting
d
i
liked
it
as
my
first
dip
in
this
style
easy
drinking
for
sure
drinkability
wow
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
i
am
enjoying
it
very
much
but
it
is
so
complex
that
i
would
not
reach
for
another
one
after
i
finished
the
first
that
and
it
will
never
be
shipped
to
utah
d
so
easy
to
drink
this
high
abv
black
ipa
its
stouts
flavors
mixed
with
citrus
hops
makes
for
an
outstanding
brew
md
medium
to
full
body
very
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
does
not
have
the
drying
affect
on
the
palate
that
many
west
coast
ipas
have
very
drinkable
beer
but
far
from
sessionable
especially
at
8
7
abv
t
slightly
sweet
from
the
malts
upfront
and
then
it
gives
way
to
a
nice
hoppy
but
not
overly
bitter
finish
hops
are
somewhere
between
citrus
and
floral
and
pleasing
to
the
palette
pours
dark
as
a
stout
with
a
slightly
offwhite
creamy
rocky
head
several
different
hops
in
the
nose
lots
of
hops
in
the
flavor
with
the
charred
and
roasted
flavors
finally
in
the
finish
lemon
and
grapefruit
start
then
the
roast
followed
with
a
familiar
hop
pummeling
pours
a
thick
creamy
black
with
a
nice
full
tan
head
minimal
lacing
as
it
goes
down
you
expect
this
to
be
a
luxurious
gooey
tasting
beer
so
the
first
surprised
is
the
plentiful
hop
aroma
as
well
as
taste
sure
enough
it
is
chock
full
of
the
high
alpha
acid
varieties
chinook
simcoe
and
amarillo
this
one
would
not
be
out
of
place
in
the
stone
bastard
series
thick
and
rich
with
the
unexpected
hop
punch
excellent
beer
i
would
definitely
pick
one
of
these
up
again
overall
interesting
and
different
beer
the
sublimely
selfrighteous
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
also
a
nice
alternative
to
the
ordinary
i
will
drink
this
again
but
it
probably
isnt
something
i
would
make
a
part
of
my
standard
rotation
dvery
drinkable
great
great
brew
would
love
to
have
this
again
dvery
drinkable
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
brews
d
one
more
please
do
stone
got
this
right
best
per
style
yes
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
however
its
way
too
thick
for
the
tropical
hop
flavors
that
this
one
imparts
the
superhoppy
tropical
taste
makes
me
want
to
drink
this
one
like
water
but
the
mouthfeel
gets
in
the
way
the
drinkability
is
good
its
hampered
a
bit
by
the
awkward
mouthfeel
but
is
otherwise
rather
good
for
the
mouthfeel
an
amazing
brew
from
stone
and
the
beer
to
turn
the
black
ipa
haters
into
believers
worth
every
penny
d
if
i
had
reviewed
this
beer
last
year
i
would
have
given
it
a
c
in
the
past
ive
criticized
stone
for
having
sort
of
a
vomittasting
quality
on
many
of
their
hoppy
brews
maybe
this
is
due
to
genetics
or
maybe
in
the
past
i
just
havent
cared
for
a
lot
of
their
stuff
however
on
this
particular
tasting
of
sublimely
selfrighteous
i
totally
dug
it
living
in
the
great
northwest
i
have
access
to
some
great
ipas
ironically
most
come
from
san
diego
north
of
santa
barbara
north
of
san
fran
and
portland
ty
black
raven
for
your
wisdom
seeker
ssr
is
best
of
style
fantastic
stone
ironically
i
hate
your
ipas
but
the
black
is
badass
the
selfrighteous
ale
reminds
me
very
much
of
deschutes
cascadian
dark
ale
their
flavors
are
both
fantastic
mixing
a
strong
pale
ale
with
the
darker
flavors
of
a
porter
or
stout
i
love
pale
ales
and
i
love
stouts
so
this
beer
is
a
perfect
blend
of
the
two
if
you
want
something
packed
full
of
flavor
yet
very
drinkable
then
definitely
pick
this
up
great
beer
by
stone
d
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
again
unless
it
were
already
inebriated
and
it
were
handed
to
me
for
free
the
beer
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
it
quickly
becomes
light
in
the
tongue
but
hops
take
over
a
slight
roast
and
citrus
pair
to
a
dry
finish
leaving
a
big
bitter
on
the
tongue
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
overpowering
could
drink
a
couple
servings
with
no
problem
another
winner
from
the
arrogant
bastards
at
stone
from
notes
take
a
few
weeks
ago
its
a
black
but
not
opaque
pour
tan
fluffy
head
with
don
ho
approved
tiny
bubbles
hops
hops
and
more
hops
in
the
nose
but
what
did
you
expect
creamy
mouthfeel
that
invites
another
sip
bitter
finish
all
hops
wheres
the
malt
dont
care
awesome
like
ogling
a
farrah
fawcett
poster
while
listening
to
slayer
ill
buy
twenty
more
sublimely
self
righteous
that
is
md
very
smooth
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
one
of
the
best
in
this
new
category
this
is
an
enigma
of
a
beer
so
much
to
take
in
here
that
it
might
take
a
few
more
bottles
to
sort
everything
out
looking
forward
to
it
pours
opaque
rubytinged
black
with
a
minimal
creamy
head
and
thin
lacing
nose
is
all
hops
upfront
a
soft
stab
of
cut
grass
with
fresh
tangerine
peel
lingering
in
the
background
on
a
solid
plank
of
roasted
malt
notes
loving
the
nose
taste
opens
with
some
distant
chocolate
shavings
quickly
enveloped
by
a
combination
of
roasted
malt
base
overcome
by
a
sharp
swing
of
hops
this
is
one
awesome
balanced
brew
the
abv
is
barely
noticeable
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
full
a
sturdy
canvas
another
stone
i
love
who
cares
if
this
is
strong
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
that
it
took
a
while
to
work
my
way
through
the
bottle
im
used
to
darker
beers
having
more
of
a
sugar
or
caramel
bend
to
them
but
in
this
instance
this
seemed
more
like
a
very
hoppy
ale
or
an
amber
ale
the
balance
is
wonderful
here
and
the
only
way
to
equate
the
bittersweet
aftertaste
is
with
my
feelings
as
i
took
the
empty
bottle
out
to
recycling
this
is
about
as
good
as
beer
gets
if
youre
a
hophead
kudos
to
stone
pours
a
cocacola
colorerd
deep
brown
very
little
head
or
lacing
faint
smell
of
hops
but
not
a
lot
going
on
caramel
malt
taste
followed
by
slight
bitter
after
taste
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
with
a
sweet
touch
i
could
do
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
okay
this
beer
needs
to
open
up
as
my
beer
warms
the
malts
are
starting
to
show
there
is
a
burnt
brown
sugar
quality
to
it
now
that
was
not
there
before
there
is
also
a
touch
of
it
in
the
nose
still
this
quality
is
virtually
hidden
behind
the
hops
everything
above
still
stands
but
i
just
thought
i
needed
to
add
that
in
d
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
beer
i
cant
say
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
but
i
would
not
shy
away
from
having
this
one
again
good
beer
d
oh
i
could
drink
this
often
a
very
nice
beer
d
this
ale
was
extremely
enjoyable
shared
with
my
wife
because
of
the
unexpected
hop
presence
extremely
wellcrafted
ale
with
high
drinkability
great
mouthfeel
of
a
fantastic
medium
bodied
beer
what
a
experience
will
definitely
buy
it
again
and
will
try
more
from
this
brewer
d
very
good
but
hops
can
overwhelm
at
times
i
paired
with
a
gouda
which
was
pleasing
d
very
drinkable
and
so
enjoyable
for
a
style
that
i
had
not
tried

there
in

this
is

like
so
many
of

this
beer
is
just
way
too
out

for

it
has
some

co2
make
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
beautiful
balck
dark
mahogany
with
a
nice
frothy
espresso
creme
head
lacing
is
consistent
and
substantial
nice
floral
pine
smell
tells
you
youre
in
for
a
hop
treat
it
doesnt
disappoint
first
taste
denotes
citrus
and
molasses
the
alcohol
is
foreward
initially
which
i
dont
mind
it
mellows
in
subsequent
tastes
to
a
nice
warming
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
more
so
than
i
expected
the
hop
presence
wins
by
a
nose
over
that
malt
sweetness
which
is
never
cloying
just
an
all
around
flavorful
drinkable
beer
and
a
real
treat
for
the
beer
senses
this
beer
is
really
straight
forward
but
really
well
done
amazing
beer
all
around
and
incredibly
drinkable
one
bomber
wasnt
enough
two
would
be
no
problem
enjoy
a
humbling
experience
its
as
if
the
best
qualities
of
an
ipa
porter
and
barleywine
were
combined
into
one
beer
this
is
a
sipping
beer
to
me
partly
because
it
is
strong
and
partly
because
it
is
so
interesting
as
a
homebrewer
i
am
jealous
of
the
mind
that
created
this
regarding
drinkability
the
alcohol
at
8
7
by
volume
is
never
noticeable
you
might
feel
it
but
you
wont
taste
it
and
i
think
the
subdued
complexity
and
interesting
bright
points
make
it
remarkably
compelling
its
brilliantly
balanced
at
its
core
and
superbly
studded
with
hops
quite
possibly
my
favorite
beer
from
stone
d
this
beer
is
excellent
but
at
8
7
abv
one
must
be
wise
i
sipped
on
my
bomber
for
about
90
minutes
which
gave
me
a
good
chance
to
note
its
varying
nuances
with
temperature
change
i
would
drink
this
beer
anywhere
anytime
but
not
more
than
a
pint
or
two
o
overall
this
beer
is
well
assembled
and
as
such
theres
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
at
all
having
said
that
theres
also
nothing
really
impressive
about
it
either
allinall
solid
but
uninspiring
a
bit
like
a
girl
calling
a
guy
nice
i
want
more
of
this
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
one
a
week
this
is
a
great
beer
d
this
is
a
seriously
drinkable
brew
hoppy
and
delicious
and
the
8
7
abv
is
hardly
detectable
i
have
to
thank
cdkrenz
for
introducing
me
to
this
beer
that
is
far
less
than
modest
simply
delicious
i
challenge
stone
to
make
a
beer
that
doesnt
make
me
happy
this
beer
delivers
very
well
perhaps
the
hoppiest
cascadian
ive
had
yet
d
great
drinkability
considering
the
abv
theres
almost
no
hint
of
it
in
the
taste
im
a
big
fan
of
the
regular
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
which
also
utilizes
amarillo
hops
but
not
at
this
level
this
version
definitely
takes
it
up
a
notch
great
stuff
not
sure
what
the
availability
on
this
one
is
but
if
i
ever
see
it
again
ill
be
sure
to
have
a
couple
i
wouldnt
go
for
this
again
unless
it
was
on
draft
somewhere
understandably
so
an
ipa
though
it
still
needs
balance
something
i
feel
the
sublimely
is
lacking
d
this
is
a
great
beer
flavors
are
bold
yet
balanced
and
way
to
easy
to
drink
great
stuff
stone
aces
it
again
d
i
really
like
dark
ales
and
ipas
so
for
me
this
is
a
very
drinkable
mixture
of
the
too
overall
not
a
bad
beer
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
i
would
order
one
immediately
just
to
see
if
their
is
a
taste
differential
another
champion
beer
from
stone
sublime
indeed
fairly
light
bodied
for
a
beer
this
big
overally
fairly
drinkable
definitely
a
good
representation
of
this
style
d
fine
sipping
beer
enjoy
on
a
special
occasion
this
is
my
first
stone
beer
and
was
rather
impressed
look
forward
to
sampling
more
stone
beers
i
have
only
tried
this
style
one
other
time
quite
enjoyed
it
lovers
everywhere
nice
two
finger
chocolate
brown
head
of
thick
foam
leaving
thick
clinging
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
color
is
dark
dark
brown
comparing
to
a
40
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
good
aroma
of
hops
right
on
top
with
lime
sour
bread
lemon
peel
coco
and
oats
powerful
taste
of
pine
citrus
sweet
malt
and
oats
a
little
heavy
on
hops
but
a
good
taste
anyway
not
a
beer
you
would
want
to
drink
very
many
of
unless
you
are
home
or
have
a
good
sober
driver
well
worth
the
price
d
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
with
both
ipa
and
stoutporter
notes
coming
through
at
all
times
absolutely
worth
a
shot
if
you
like
the
style
this
isnt
to
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
sure
i
may
have
wanted
more
balance
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
something
nice
and
bitter
yet
clean
this
is
a
good
option
the
searing
grapefruit
bitterness
of
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
this
is
the
best
black
ipa
that
ive
had
so
far
but
having
uplands
komodo
dragonfly
recently
the
gap
has
closed
drinkability
exceptional
everything
about
this
ale
is
right
taste
smell
appearance
and
feel
are
all
amazing
this
might
be
the
ipa
in
which
i
compare
all
others
from
now
on
again
for
my
uncultured
taste
the
drinkability
was
poor
at
best
as
the
mix
of
sour
grapefriut
and
sweet
licorace
was
too
much
for
my
palate
in
all
fairness
and
seeing
how
well
liked
this
beer
is
the
bottle
was
most
likely
way
past
its
prime
oh
yea
if
you
do
happen
to
like
coors
dont
buy
this
beer
thinking
you
will
like
it
cheers
all
about
the
hops
and
not
so
much
the
roasted
malts
which
is
how
i
like
this
style
the
best
cascadian
dark
ale
ive
tried
to
date
the
sublimely
ale
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
color
nice
tan
colored
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
aromas
are
coffee
malts
and
slight
hints
of
raisins
and
prunes
taste
is
pretty
hot
and
almost
too
alcoholic
the
alcohol
overpowers
a
lot
of
the
other
flavors
on
the
quaff
a
nice
hop
finish
rounds
out
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
mediocre
i
think
this
will
do
really
well
with
a
little
age
on
it
d
i
think
this
beer
is
awesome
and
probably
the
best
example
of
this
emerging
style
stone
at
it
again
well
done
drinkability
even
with
a
higher
abv
there
is
enough
body
to
this
beer
so
i
could
see
myself
having
emptied
several
22
oz
bottles
and
being
welded
to
my
seat
but
in
beer
heaven
black
ipa
is
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
and
this
is
a
fantastic
example
another
hit
from
stone
a
brewery
that
can
really
do
no
wrong
will
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
some
more
overall
this
is
another
amazing
offering
from
stone
this
is
definitely
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
and
i
will
be
picking
up
another
bottle
in
the
near
future
a
really
good
black
ipa
maybe
the
best
one
i
have
ever
had
in
that
style
sublime
indeed
selfrighteous
uh
its
brewed
by
stone
nuff
said
d
though
delicious
this
isnt
the
most
drinkable
beer
its
quite
bitter
with
a
long
finish
has
lots
of
flavors
going
on
that
get
a
tad
cloying
after
a
while
as
they
dont
really
evolve
each
flavor
profile
is
easily
identifiable
and
sticks
out
from
the
others
and
it
has
a
restrictive
abv
of
8
7
i
managed
a
bomber
by
myself
but
that
was
certainly
plenty
i
would
pick
this
up
again
in
a
heartbeat
especially
a
fresh
bottle
but
id
want
to
share
a
bomber
with
a
friend
d
an
excellent
beer
that
would
be
one
of
my
goto
beers
if
not
for
the
high
abv
still
an
excellent
choice
d
holy
crap
where
have
you
been
all
my
life
black
ipas
are
easily
my
favorite
style
of
the
last
couple
years
and
ssr
is
exceptional
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
stone
so
i
usually
walk
by
them
when
im
making
a
purchase
this
beer
has
given
me
a
new
found
respect
for
them
buy
this
now
d
the
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
easily
and
has
a
lot
of
flavor
this
was
my
first
black
ipa
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
and
interesting
style
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
as
for
this
beer
though
i
would
pick
it
up
again
for
sure
if
youre
lucky
enough
to
find
the
double
dry
hopped
version
of
this
on
tap
drink
as
many
as
you
can
rare
you
find
something
that
makes
a
perfect
beer
perfecter
d
dangerously
drinkable
given
the
abv
great
beer
overall
and
another
solid
selection
from
stone
pours
a
black
brown
color
with
a
caramel
colored
head
looks
like
an
is
but
has
an
aroma
of
a
dipa
grapefruit
and
pine
there
is
a
very
subtle
roastyness
to
it
but
very
distant
tastes
like
a
dipa
sweet
up
front
then
hit
with
the
harsh
hopiness
a
resinous
brew
if
you
look
for
it
you
can
taste
hints
of
the
roasty
malts
but
i
have
had
dipas
that
are
more
malt
forward
than
this
brew
excellent
beer
you
will
notice
the
maltiness
kick
up
as
it
warms
cheers
a
bold
brew
with
big
hops
full
bodied
and
bold
good
complexity
this
one
gets
your
attention
would
drink
this
beer
any
day
poured
dark
chestnut
brown
with
an
off
white
head
beautiful
garnet
hues
in
the
light
no
lace
very
assertive
citrus
less
assertive
pine
and
finally
a
light
touch
of
coffee
and
roasted
barley
which
i
cant
quite
comprehend
with
my
nose
at
the
moment
the
taste
however
seems
to
put
it
back
in
place
and
is
actually
quite
good
the
grapefruit
lasts
throughout
but
fades
into
pine
in
the
finish
followed
by
a
touch
of
astringent
coffeelike
bitterness
how
odd
i
could
call
this
an
india
porter
ale
or
an
ipa
with
an
identity
crisis
whatever
it
may
be
it
fools
me
nicely
and
im
having
a
blast
enjoying
this
beer
the
rich
bitter
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
with
at
lovely
citrus
peel
bitterness
and
faint
toffee
sweetness
there
is
a
slight
booziness
that
gently
warms
but
doesnt
burn
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
abv
its
so
delicious
that
its
hard
to
stop
drinking
i
love
it
and
am
very
glad
that
stone
has
added
this
to
its
year
round
releases
d
a
lot
of
flavor
to
handle
utterly
delicious
its
name
says
it
all
d
this
wasnt
the
first
time
ive
had
sssra
but
it
was
the
first
time
ive
had
it
from
a
growler
let
alone
it
was
the
first
thing
i
put
in
my
new
stone
growler
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
change
up
from
the
usual
ipa
the
richness
of
a
complex
porter
or
stout
with
the
great
flavor
of
a
solid
ipa
combined
seamlessly
highly
recommend
note
im
trying
to
be
nice
and
keep
the
style
in
mind
but
in
general
i
hate
ipas
of
all
kinds
however
this
one
was
not
so
bad
and
i
could
certainly
appreciate
the
bitterness
ill
never
be
a
hophead
but
this
was
a
fine
drink
to
be
sure
full
flavored
and
very
easydrinking
with
a
wellmasked
alcohol
presence
wish
id
tried
this
one
sooner
this
was
like
an
american
take
on
a
theakston
old
peculier
for
those
of
you
familiar
with
that
particular
yorkshire
ale
it
is
rich
dark
smooth
and
malty
without
ever
being
heavy
an
awful
lot
of
brownish
head
when
you
pour
this
into
the
glass
that
takes
a
while
to
dissipate
probably
has
something
to
do
with
it
coming
from
a
bottle
and
my
walking
it
home
from
the
store
i
will
definitely
have
some
more
in
the
future
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
complex
and
layered
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
deserving
of
accolades
lower
carbonation
smooth
i
polished
off
the
bomber
pretty
quickly
easy
to
drink
and
no
notice
of
the
almost
9
abv
d
with
everything
going
on
its
still
a
fairly
easydrinking
beer
dangerously
so
for
almost
9
abv
and
id
easily
get
it
again
d
good
drinkability
split
a
bomber
with
some
family
members
but
i
could
of
had
a
bit
more
abv
is
hidden
very
well
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
stone
and
will
definitely
throw
this
beer
into
the
rotation
now
that
the
weather
is
cooling
down
at
nearly
9
a
few
of
these
will
have
you
melting
back
in
your
chair
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
just
like
a
porter
small
tactile
bubbly
mouthfeel
very
very
very
drinkable
incredibly
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
why
the
xi
anniversary
was
so
highly
requested
this
is
a
badass
beer
drinkability
is
really
quite
good
theres
a
very
good
balance
to
this
beer
and
while
im
definitely
not
a
hop
head
even
i
can
appreciate
how
well
the
bitterness
goes
with
the
malts
and
sweetness
very
well
done
and
i
definitely
have
to
give
props
to
stone
for
crafting
yet
another
winner
in
their
long
line
of
top
notch
brews
well
ive
had
this
one
a
few
times
and
now
just
getting
around
to
reviewing
it
before
i
even
poor
the
beer
i
can
smell
that
west
coast
dry
hopping
pours
black
with
a
two
finger
light
tan
head
with
spotty
lacing
all
around
again
crazy
west
coast
piney
hop
aroma
multi
layered
hoppiness
a
little
piney
and
floral
a
good
bit
bitter
with
a
lasting
sharp
after
taste
full
body
and
rich
without
tasting
like
a
hoppy
porter
well
carbed
and
well
rounded
and
easy
to
drink
to
boot
at
8
7
abv
there
is
not
hot
flavor
and
no
sign
of
the
booze
d
delicious
with
quite
an
intoxicating
effect
after
the
first
pint
i
love
the
roast
malts
and
biting
hop
flavor
stone
makes
great
beers
period
this
beer
has
a
lovey
black
colour
and
an
excellent
lightbrown
head
the
smell
is
delicious
mostly
of
citrussy
hops
it
has
a
malty
flavour
up
front
which
is
quickly
overtaken
by
the
hoppiness
very
nice
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
but
afterawhile
the
aftertaste
builds
up
too
much
d
a
unique
brew
that
is
a
rage
on
the
senses
a
bomber
of
this
is
all
ones
palette
could
take
bonus
points
for
being
unique
overall
i
like
it
but
it
isnt
something
id
have
often
i
just
simply
prefer
more
direct
styles
d
stone
makes
some
solid
brews
but
this
just
isnt
something
that
i
liked
all
that
much
it
was
good
but
not
great
still
a
good
beer
though
and
enjoyed
the
full
22oz
bomber
there
was
maybe
a
bit
more
body
than
a
strong
ipa
but
this
is
no
thick
brew
its
incredibly
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
imo
it
finishes
surprisingly
clean
and
not
too
dry
sublimely
easy
to
drink
with
righteous
flavor
bravo
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
was
my
first
beer
on
cask
and
while
i
really
liked
it
it
didnt
floor
me
as
being
incredibly
good
it
poured
a
solid
black
with
a
light
foamy
head
that
lasted
several
minutes
of
sipping
the
beer
had
a
fairly
light
body
with
a
malty
taste
and
a
strong
hoppy
finish
slight
chocolaty
and
roasty
flavors
were
present
but
nothing
overall
that
greatly
impressed
me
although
i
might
have
enjoyed
this
over
deschutes
hop
in
the
dark
cascadian
black
ale
a
beautiful
beer
i
will
continue
to
seek
out
the
style
medium
to
heavy
body
decent
carbonation
drinkability
is
alright
for
how
overwhelming
this
can
be
pours
black
with
a
foamy
mocha
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
a
very
inviting
citrus
hop
bouquet
so
weird
to
have
a
dark
beer
with
such
a
great
hop
aroma
but
also
amazing
the
taste
starts
with
a
huge
hop
presence
followed
with
some
great
citrus
flavor
followed
with
a
small
bitter
malt
aftertaste
with
the
hops
lingering
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
almost
heavy
a
nice
smooth
beer
with
great
balance
in

drinkability
the
22
oz
bomber
just
isnt
enough
sometimes
maybe
a
four
pack
would
suffice
if
i
was
in
between
meals
i
could
probably
tackle
the
four
otherwise
sits
a
bit
heavy
and
is
pretty
potent
so
be
responsible
d
one
bomber
is
enough
for
me
but
it
went
fast
goes
down
smooth
and
makes
you
fall
in
love
with
it
it
deserves
its
reputation
as
one
of
the
best
ababipas
in
the
world
best

allow

to
pop
a

more
pours
a
dark
mahogany
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
faded
slowly
with
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
sweet
molasses
and
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
thick
sweet
and
creamy
at
the
front
end
followed
by
a
earthy
bitterness
and
some
slight
astringency
from
the
roasted
malts
the
finish
is
slow
and
lingering
with
some
warming
body
is
on
the
thick
side

drinkability
is
very

i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
one
of
the
few
that
i
wish
i
had
less
of
the
bomber
is
too
much
for
me
maybe
it
is
the
strength
of
hops
duh
it
is
an
ipa
or
just
the
astringent
nature
but
by

the

the

quite
drinkable
for
its
strength

id
definitely
have
this
one
again
d
dangerously
drinkable
there
are
only
a
few
stone
brews
that
wow
me
and
this
is
one
of
them
i
am
honestly
surprised
at
how
high
my
ratings
are
but
i
stand
by
them
ssra
is
my
shit
this
is
good
and
is
nicely
drinkable
as
long
as
you
like
hops
unfortunately
this
is
quite
a
bit
more
hopforward
than
i
really
enjoy
my
beers
to
be
im
not
yet
worthy
i
guess
overall
a
very
good
offering
from
stone
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
havent
had
it
before
d
you
probably
are
not
worthy
of
this
beer
d
the
marriage
of
a
barleywine
american
brown
ale
and
an
ipa
all
crammed
into
one
this
ale
was
complex
and
tasty
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
as
the
8
7
abv
and
hop
profile
do
make
the
brew
a
little
hot
but
it
does
mello
a
bit
when
let
to
come
up
to
room
temperature
id
likely
get
it
again
for
its
sweet
and
bitter
complexity
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
piney
hops
with
roasted
malt
i
also
get
a
touch
of
citrus
the
flavor
is
pine
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
and
low
carbonation
d
not
bad
drinkableness
for
something
this
intence
and
alcoholic
alcohol
content
is
barely
evidenced
in
the
flavor
and
by
the
end
of
a
pint
im
starting
to
get
the
buzz
on
hoppy
and
tasty
but
a
big
brew
sort
of
a
conglomerate
of
porter
brown
ale
and
dipa
this
black
beauty
was
well
worth
the
7
bomber
dark
dark
brown
with
fluffy
coffee
creamer
head
floating
on
top
elegant
but
strong

aroma
that
touches
upon
hop
resin
leaves
spice
sweet
malt
slight
booze
and
weirdly
reminiscent
of
soy
sauce
thick
creamy
mouthfeel
brings
on
a
slew
of
flavors
ranging
from
syrup
sweet
malts
hops
tobaccoesque
hop
bitterness
slight
bitter
cocoa
coffee
beans
hop
bitterness
finishes
out
the
drink
and
slicks
the
tongue
despite
the
strength
of
the
beer
and
its
flavors
it
remains
a
very
drinkable
ale
that
asks
to
be
enjoyed
at
dusk
a
tasty
brew
that
will
put
some
hair
on
the
beer
drinkers
chest
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
sure
why
it
had
to
be
black
because
the
dark
malts
dont
really
add
anything
to
the
beer
underneath
the
hop
character
d
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
very
full
of
flavor
not
sure
the
flavors
going
on
work
well
together
but
it
sure
is
interesting
being
as
i
had
been
told
that
it
was
only
going
to
be
available
on
draft
in
my
area
when
i
found
it
in
a
neighboring
town
in
bottles
i
bought
em
out
and
i
could
happily
drink
the
whole
lot
of
them
d
unbelievably
drinkable
i
want
more
now
it
drinks
like
an
ipa
but
looks
like
a
stout
i
love
this
so
much
pours
a
dark
stout
like
black
with
a
generous
head
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
wort
like
taste
is
very
similar
a
bit
raw
tasting
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
like
hoppiness
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
in
the
end
one
is
enough
for
me
and
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
it
was
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
finish
the
entire
bottle
pours
stoutish
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
dense
tan
head
that
recedes
down
to
a
ring
with
an
island
in
the
middle
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
ever
had
it
smells
like
a
malty
hop
soaked
in
grapefruit
juice
and
it
tastes
like
a
hoppy
grapefruit
when
i
aerate
it
in
my
mouth
i
get
bitter
dark
fruits
i
love
it
its
viscous
and
it
finishes
sweet
and
dry
its
a
strong
interesting
beer
but
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
it
at
all
ill
take
pleasure
in
pushing
it
on
friends
who
are
in
the
mood
for
something
new
very
worthy
of
my
first
review
here
d
in
summarythis
is
a
very
hoppy
black
ipai
wouldnt
say
its
balancedbut
the
malt
is
not
hiding
and
with
anything
ipa
i
expect
it
to
be
very
hoppy
this
brew
is
pretty
aggressive
and
very
good
overall
abv
is
completely
hidden
by
the
flavors
this
brew
exceeds
my
expectations
for
this
hybrid
style
purchased
this
at
bootleggers
in
thopsham
me
glad
to
see
this
there
as
was
a
nice
tasting
beer
if
there
was
ever
a
beer
that
could
be
clasified
as
black
ipa
this
would
be
it
dark
black
and
lots
of
hops
this
beer
has
it
and
should
be
a
must
have
for
anyones
portfolio
pours
a
deep
opaque
black
with
an
ample
tan
head
generally
malty
in
nature
with
bitterness
coming
from
what
seems
to
be
roasted
and
chocolate
malts
taste
is
similar
with
a
chocolaty
malt
flavor
and
bitterness
some
coffee
notes
as
well
not
overpoweringly
chocolate
but
definitely
good
feel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
a
slight
fullness
carbonation
is
light
and
tickles
the
senses
well
overall
a
very
good
beverage
better
luck
next
time
well
i
now
wish
id
consumed
this
a
year
ago
but
based
on
the
reviews
it
seemed
to
be
still
blazing
strong
decent
enough
beer
but
id
drink
there
if
you
have
them
a
almost
black
body
with
a
quickly
dying
tan
head
and
minimal
lace
intense
hoppy
smell
but
there
is
a
noticeable
aroma
of
roasted
and
cocoa
malt
like
a
hoppy
coffee
stout
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
that
is
smooth
and
a
tad
creamy
with
a
mixture
heavier
on
the
former
of
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malt
gives
a
lil
bit
of
sweetness
and
citric
hops
also
a
minor
note
of
black
cherry
and
other
plush
fruit
easy
to
drink
ale
that
is
meant
to
relax
w
after
dinner
22oz
bottle
poured
into
a
duvel
tulip
style
glass
these
beer
pours
completely
black
when
in
the
glass
it
comes
out
a
very
dark
brown
when
the
liquid
gets
a
little
thin
but
overall
its
pretty
black
and
opaque
the
beer
produces
a
tan
head
with
some
decent
lacing
to
it
the
way
beer
should
look
a
very
good
looking
brew
the
smell
is
truly
exquisite
its
complex
but
gets
to
the
point
overall
its
completely
dominated
by
the
hops
but
the
malts
make
themselves
noticeable
as
well
roasted
malts
with
a
slight
smokey
smell
that
is
covered
by
a
delicious
hop
aroma
a
little
more
pine
than
citrus
in
my
opinion
the
taste
is
truly
outstanding
but
i
wish
i
had
the
opportunity
to
grade
it
a
4
9
i
think
thats
what
i
go
with
in
that
situation
like
most
beers
of
this
style
its
very
hoppy
the
good
thing
here
is
its
not
to
overwhelming
along
with
the
great
hoppy
taste
is
the
good
malted
flavor
it
has
a
great
malted
taste
much
like
the
smell
with
a
slight
smokey
taste
wonderfully
balanced
overall
mouthfeel
is
good
not
quite
full
bodied
in
my
opinion
but
pretty
close
has
a
slight
dry
bitter
finish
from
the
hop
very
good
extremely
drinkable
beer
could
drink
this
rain
or
shine
on
any
occasion
a
wonderful
beer
to
have
on
standby
and
you
should
on
tap
at
the
brattleboro
vermont
brewers
festival
on
may
22
2010
there
is
a
mahogany
dark
brown
pour
with
some
red
hues
and
a
twoinch
puffy
tan
head
hops
are
the
lead
ingredient
in
the
aroma
but
it
seems
very
wellbalance
and
not
overdone
hops
also
tend
to
be
the
first
thing
caught
on
the
tongue
but
there
is
also
a
rather
molasseslike
sugarsweetness
in
there
definitely
not
as
bitterly
hopped
as
some
strong
ales
this
one
tends
to
be
a
lot
mellower
than
other
strong
ales
pretty
good
taste
rich
and
bitter
and
pretty
darn
good
herbalfloralgrassy
hops
with
a
nice
roundness
and
sharp
bitterness
a
healthy
helping
of
ripe
pear
and
grapefruit
oil
that
tickles
the
throat
molasses
and
caramel
and
some
barely
perceptible
clove
with
nice
dark
malt
flavors
mochacoffee
emerges
as
it
warms
slightly
interesting
play
between
the
dark
slightly
roasted
malts
and
the
bitternes
but
the
bitterness
is
a
just
a
bit
harsh
and
hurts
drinkability
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
oily
finish
is
grassy
with
an
astringent
edge
grainy
bitter
coffee
residual
orange
oil
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
at
all
i
did
not
get
any
of
the
malty
notes
others
have
mentioned
just
a
black
beer
with
to
much
soapy
hops
no
nuance
or
balance
i
would
not
recommend
this
long
finish
abv
feels
about
right
on
this
one
kinda
looks
like
a
stout
smells
like
an
ipa
and
drinks
like
a
really
good
brown
ale
d
another
good
brew
from
stone
id
have
another
alcohol
is
evident
tasting
stronger
than
its
percentage
this
is
a
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
in
moderation
d
just
really
good
very
unique
and
a
little
puzzling
when
you
pour
it
you
think
it
is
a
stout
when
you
smell
it
you
think
it
is
a
barleywine
and
when
you
taste
it
you
think
that
it
is
a
brown
ale
with
a
hint
of
coffee
stout
that
finishes
like
a
strong
ale
i
could
easily
drink
two
bombers
and
feel
that
it
is
worthy
of
the
name
it
is
given
d
hell
even
my
burps
are
delicious
what
do
you
think
its
like
going
down
if
i
had
this
for
every
day
of
my
life
well
for
one
id
have
an
awesome
beer
belly
but
secondly
i
dont
think
you
could
find
me
tired
of
this
taste
at
least
give
me
20
years
with
this
stuff
then
maybe
ill
reconsider
d
nicely
drinkable
beer
very
complex
but
not
in
any
way
overpowering
as
this
is
my
first
black
ipacascadian
dark
ale
there
is
a
definite
novelty
i
like
it
but
wouldnt
drink
more
than
a
bomber
at
a
time
even
without
taking
the
alcohol
content
into
account
served
from
bottle
into
a
spaten
mug
pours
dark
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
onefinger
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
a
slight
hoppy
note
the
flavor
on
the
otherhand
is
of
weak
hops
with
a
subtle
nutty
flavor
it
was
medium
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
as
with
most
stones
definitely
worth
trying
if
you
have
not
before
taste
is
a
like
too
coffeechocolate
for
my
taste
but
not
sweet
other
ale
styles
i
like
better
but
no
question
this
is
a
great
beer
if
you
love
this
style
youll
be
in
heaven
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
as
i
wrap
up
this
review
i
wish
i
had
gotten
a
second
post
review
celebration
bottle
to
enjoy
most
certainly
will
i
enjoy
this
sublime
and
selfrighteous
ale
d
man
i
may
have
to
have
this
again
but
i
am
pretty
sure
its
the
hoppiest
beer
i
ever
had
from
stone
they
are
know
for
angry
beers
and
this
one
had
some
good
rage
d
a
pretty
cool
creation
overall
very
complex
but
well
balanced
definitely
worth
trying
drink
interesting
brew
characteristics
of
an
irs
but
slighly
thinner
as
hops
dominate
and
roasted
malts
are
less
pressent
very
drinkable
can
selfrighteous
be
considered
a
beer
quality
this
brew
earns
that
right
the
hops
while
dominant
never
overwhelm
things
the
malt
helps
balance
things
out
yet
never
get
in
the
way
the
alcohol
is
kept
in
check
as
well
this
brew
is
quite
the
achievement
it
goes
down
smooth
while
never
overpowering
the
folks
at
stone
have
crafted
another
classic
this
beer
was
black
like
a
stout
with
a
thick
tan
head
and
abundant
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
sweet
chocolate
and
flowers
nice
melange
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
pine
in
the
taste
the
hops
really
intensified
in
my
mouth
nice
balance
of
sweet
chocolate
and
bitter
hops
will
drink
more
of
these
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
beer
from
stone
i
had
this
when
it
was
the
anniversary
beer
and
loved
it
then
extremely
glad
they
brought
this
back
at
6
a
bomber
this
is
a
great
deal
the
9
is
noticeable
but
not
distracting
taste
is
even
more
bitter
than
expected
with
a
terrific
mouthfeel
and
finish
i
feel
its
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
ibus
for
my
taste
ever
since
i
fell
in
love
with
the
elixir
that
is
barleywine
other
styles
seem
to
fall
short
of
the
stone
offerings
ive
tried
ill
take
the
arrogant
the
double
bastard
and
the
barleywine
over
this
but
this
one
is
still
definitely
goood
shiiit
i
think
this
beer
deserves
a
perfect
score
for
sure
i
cant
find
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
i
am
very
pleased
with
my
experience
indeed
overall
very
tasty
but
powerful
ones
good
though
i
could
easily
see
myself
ordering
it
again
in
the
future
p
s
another
swallow
as
this
slightly
warms
and
i
get
the
dark
sweet
dried
fruit
sense
i
get
in
some
really
good
imperial
stouts
has
much
to
offer
as
you
try
to
take
this
one
in
slowly
and
experience
its
many
nuances
deliciously
hopped
sweet
goodness
the
hops
are
spectacularly
citrusy
in
a
truly
american
fashion
sweet
roasted
barley
and
delicious
thick
grainy
body
the
drinkability
is
excellent
drinkability
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
great
and
helps
make
it
evaporate
but
this
is
a
bit
hopheavy
and
does
not
really
have
any
distinguishing
characteristics
over
ab
or
other
strong
ales
poured
into
a
tulip
glass
from
a
bottle
that
says
best
62910
they
love
their
hops
at
stone
and
i
love
them
for
that
normally
you
would
expect
a
beer
this
dark
to
be
sweet
and
heavy
but
this
one
comes
across
like
some
crazy
hybrid
of
just
about
everything
stone
does
well
and
the
result
is
awesome
pours
fairly
thick
like
a
porter
say
and
as
dark
as
a
stout
but
with
more
carbonation
a
nice
thick
toasted
brown
head
forms
the
scent
is
almost
all
hops
with
notes
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
a
beautiful
melange
of
hops
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
raisins
not
too
sweet
and
not
too
bitter
the
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
gives
it
a
lighter
body
and
cleaner
finish
than
an
imperial
stout
making
it
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
220z
bomber
pours
nearly
back
with
slight
reddish
glow
at
the
bottom
when
held
to
the
light
smells
hoppy
with
malty
notes
and
a
strong
hint
of
charred
wood
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
dry
hops
and
toasted
malt
with
a
slight
smack
of
cherry
cough
drops
on
the
finish
the
mouth
is
dry
most
the
way
through
the
slight
sweetness
at
the
end
but
that
diverse
of
a
mouth
from
tongue
to
throat
its
quite
drinkable
with
the
alcohol
well
hidden
but
the
predominant
woodiness
would
prevent
it
from
being
a
session
beer
solid
overall
but
rather
mundane
compared
to
the
stars
in
the
stone
universe
overall
not
what
i
was
expecting
for
some
reason
but
pretty
good
i
enjoy
this
a
little
more
than
the
score
indicates
the
weight
for
my
score
in
the
mouthfeel
deducts
more
points
than
i
think
it
should
probably
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
3
9
imo
still
a
sipper
for
me
i
like
bitter
beers
but
this
just
didnt
sit
so
well
for
me
this
beer
is
still
drinkable
alcohol
is
more
prevalent
since
the
beer
is
so
unpronounced
now
carbonation
is
lively
i
could
tell
immediately
from
the
loud
hiss
as
i
opened
the
bottle
definitely
past
its
prime
though
d
goes
down
a
lot
easier
than
youd
think
for
this
abv
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
dryish
hoppy
finish
helps
in
this
regard
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
spare
off
white
head
and
good
lacing
smells
heavily
hoppy
and
bitter
although
wasnt
as
hoppy
in
flavor
mostly
just
bitter
with
a
slightly
roasted
nutty
carmel
taste
the
finish
is
extremely
bitter
not
nearly
as
full
bodied
as
i
would
have
thought
by
the
look
this
beer
is
delcious
and
goes
down
very
easy
would
definitely
try
again
and
would
highly
recommend
this
was
definitely
a
very
complex
iconoclastic
beer
that
i
will
continue
to
buy
and
enjoy
however
by
means
of
comparison
i
think
that
arrogant
and
double
bastard
are
better
and
more
balanced
brews
bottom
line
it
is
a
fun
beer
drinking
beer
can
be
a
fun
experience
and
stone
did
a
great
job
creating
this
unique
beer
it
will
not
be
a
beer
in
my
weekly
rotation
but
i
appreciate
the
beer
for
what
it
is
a
unique
style
that
should
be
distributed
as
a
limited
edition
overall
this
is
an
interesting
beer
it
is
interesting
in
a
good
way
because
it
pushes
style
barriers
although
i
dont
see
myself
purchasing
this
beer
too
often
it
was
still
a
great
purchase
and
one
i
would
recommend
a
great
offering
from
stone
brewing
overall
probably
the
best
black
ipa
beer
i
have
had
verdict
the
emerging
black
ipa
style
is
one
of
my
favorite
new
styles
of
the
last
decade
and
i
have
to
say
stone
have
put
together
the
best
one
ive
tried
yet
tasty
balanced
well
and
full
of
character
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
has
earned
its
cocky
attitude
d
quiet
good
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
something
i
would
drink
weekly
best
saved
for
special
occasions
when
you
want
a
deeply
hoppy
experience
american
strong
ale
american
stout
black
ipa
whatever
this
is
a
playful
interesting
damn
tasty
beer
that
successfully
marries
bigtime
hoppy
grapefruit
with
roasty
malt
enjoy
it
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
syrupy
and
the
bitterness
lingers
in
the
mouth
a
bit
to
long
a
big
beer
like
this
is
hard
to
call
drinkable
but
it
certainly
is
easy
to
go
back
to
i
like
it
a
lot
dnot
the
easiest
drinking
beer
ive
had
but
pretty
enjoyable
and
definitely
something
new
and
different
for
me
8
7
alcvol
and
you
wont
notice
any
in
the
taste
very
sophisticated
brew
from
those
beer
demons
at
stone
not
something
you
would
overall
drink
a
lot
of
im
really
digging
the
contrasting
chocolate
and
big
bitter
hops
coming
outta
these
black
ipas
and
this
one
just
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
style
good
stuff
hope
it
becomes
more
readily
available
d
very
surprising
balance
here
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
the
novelty
in
combination
of
flavors
isnt
something
id
want
to
revisit
frequently
personal
preference
only
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
overall
i
was
happy
i
picked
this
up
and
will
look
for
it
again
when
its
fresh
nice
balance
and
a
good
hoppiness
give
it
something
i
would
probably
not
be
able
to
drink
a
whole
bottle
of
but
still
enjoy
as
far
as
introductions
to
a
style
go
my
venture
into
black
ipas
was
a
good
one
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
of
more
from
this
style
to
try
i
personally
will
be
buying
up
more
ssr
in
the
future
and
passing
over
the
perennial
top
100
ruination
in
the
process
it
really
is
that
good
try
a
bottle
if
you
get
the
chance
too
and
prepare
to
be
astonished
highly
recommended
definitely
piqued
my
interest
in
darker
ales
d
still
quite
drinkable
despite
its
unbalanced
hoppiness
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
throughout
i
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
a
snifter
jet
black
pour
with
a
medium
white
head
slight
lacing
it
has
big
pine
and
grapefruit
notes
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
lots
of
pine
and
tropical
fruit
from
first
sip
to
aftertaste
the
flavors
are
strong
and
linger
for
a
long
time
the
beer
is
mediumfull
in
body
and
has
good
carbonation
and
with
everything
stone
is
aggressively
hopped
a
good
thing
a
very
good
black
ipa
sooo
good
i
love
this
freaking
beer
i
can
say
hands
down
this
is
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
ever
had
it
has
such
an
incredible
balance
of
being
a
hugely
hopped
ipa
with
a
soft
sweet
malty
balance
mmmm
mmmm
good
d
it
just
keeps
screaming
for
more
this
is
an
extremely
complex
brew
moreso
than
most
will
give
it
credit
for
pours
almost
jet
black
with
a
thick
layer
of
tan
head
piney
hops
prominent
in
nose
aromas
of
coffee
and
chocolate
also
present
taste
is
big
boozy
and
complex
the
combination
of
bitter
resinous
hops
and
rich
roasted
malt
is
interesting
and
new
to
me
the
only
other
black
ipa
ive
tried
is
southern
tiers
iniquity
but
sssra
is
more
aggressive
on
all
fronts
sort
of
reminds
me
of
arrogant
bastard
one
of
my
favorites
but
with
more
of
everything
another
winner
from
stone
fun
beer
out
of
a
firkin
overall
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
malt
monster
with
hidden
bitterness
how
stone
dcould
have
a
few
of
these
and
would
be
a
great
hoppy
beer
for
the
darker
months
the
hops
linger
on
the
tongue
but
for
a
8
7
abv
fairly
drinkable
stones
beers
tend
to
have
a
low
finishing
gravity
and
that
helps
in
the
drinkability
category
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
another
great
beer
from
stone
this
was
an
excellent
beer
lots
of
flavor
but
quite
filling
drinkability
nice
liked
it
quite
a
bit
great
flavor
profile
clean
hop
taste
balanced
with
roastychocolatey
malt
i
will
say
its
got
more
alcohol
warmth
than
i
expected
still
great
will
do
again
d
palate
exhaustion
is
possible
with
this
one
so
its
not
exactly
a
session
beer
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
still
drinking
a
few
bombers
of
this
one
wouldnt
be
so
bad
would
it
d
although
the
bottle
reeks
of
arrogance
the
beer
inside
is
good
the
big
hop
flavor
has
lots
of
nice
depth
with
a
little
black
malt
for
support
this
is
my
first
beer
purchased
in
chicago
would
it
taste
better
if
i
had
to
drive
2hr
to
buy
it
luckily
i
dont
have
to
find
out
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
large
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
lacing
nice
carbonation
nose
is
an
ipa
hops
citrus
pine
with
some
roasted
malt
undercurrent
taste
surprises
the
pine
and
bitterness
are
there
but
so
is
some
coffee
and
chocolate
medium
body
the
finish
is
some
bitterness
but
not
overwhelming
there
is
also
some
alcohol
warmth
this
beer
was
a
nice
surprise
and
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
when
available
really
nicely
done
and
in
fact
pretty
spectacular
as
youd
expect
from
stone
craves
my
hop
and
malt
fix
simultaneously
this
one
definitely
grew
on
me
i
wasnt
blown
away
at
first
but
everything
is
in
balance
the
abv
is
right
where
it
should
be
you
get
some
sweetness
some
bitterness
it
just
works
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
hmmm
taste
is
way
more
complex
and
interesting
than
i
thought
it
would
be
thinking
of
some
black
ipas
i
have
had
in
the
recent
past
heavenly
roasted
malt
mixes
with
a
very
nice
hop
flavor
bitterness
is
there
but
not
over
the
top
in
any
way
bit
of
wintergreen
mintiness
comes
in
and
is
followed
by
an
almost
chocolaty
malt
flavor
very
smooth
for
a
black
ipa
and
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
abv
is
well
hidden
but
still
lets
you
know
it
is
up
there
i
enjoyed
this
way
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
definitely
would
encourage
any
good
beer
lover
to
try
it
dhigh
so
high
try
it
for
yourself
please
d
as
anyone
would
expect
of
a
stone
offering
this
is
boldly
flavored
and
even
more
boldly
hopped
bitter
and
almost
too
boozy
but
this
pulls
off
the
elusive
black
ipa
better
than
most
it
doesnt
tiptoe
around
but
sometimes
thats
a
nice
thing
this
is
a
big
unique
and
very
freshly
hoppy
brew
definatly
a
drinkable
beer
alcohol
is
hardly
noticable
but
this
one
bomber
is
prolly
all
i
need
in
one
sitting
this
is
for
sure
a
good
beer
and
i
would
recommend
to
all
ipa
and
stout
lover
a
like
however
in
my
eyes
this
is
more
of
an
ipa
than
anything
im
interested
to
see
what
they
will
call
this
beer
in
the
future
as
black
american
ipa
has
just
been
added
to
the
beer
styles
list
22oz
bottle
served
in
my
st
tulip
poured
the
color
of
cola
with
a
dense
three
inch
mochacolored
head
some
red
highlights
revealed
around
the
base
when
backlit
head
eventually
dissipates
into
a
soapy
skim
that
coalesces
around
the
shoulders
generous
bands
and
strands
of
lacing
were
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
reveals
lots
of
malt
brown
sugar
and
molasses
off
the
pour
out
of
the
glass
some
light
hops
aromas
come
across
in
the
back
taste
follows
nose
but
the
hops
bitterness
really
asserts
itself
at
the
back
and
lingers
between
quaffs
slightly
detracting
from
the
experience
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
with
a
level
background
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
texture
not
a
bad
brew
and
reasonably
priced
at
6
99
but
the
lingering
bitterness
was
a
little
offputting
for
me
this
beer
is
a
beast
absolutely
love
it
pours
a
great
black
tar
looking
body
a
thick
2
inch
khaki
head
is
on
top
lacing
is
present
til
its
time
to
refill
smell
completely
catches
you
off
guard
with
a
left
hook
your
nose
gets
hit
with
a
wonderful
blend
of
citrusfloral
smelling
hops
and
a
wonderful
caramel
malt
it
tastes
of
a
hop
malty
fist
fight
ending
with
a
wonderful
chocolatey
knockout
full
bodied
with
a
perfect
bitter
very
drinkable
pretty
good
beer
here
definitely
think
the
nose
was
the
best
part
of
this
beer
highly
unexpected
given
the
pour
have
had
on
tap
and
from
the
bottle
and
both
were
pretty
damn
good
drinks
proper
for
8
7
abv
slight
alcohol
detected
but
as
expected
coffee
colored
with
russet
highlights
and
an
airy
tan
head
that
leaves
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
citrus
fruity
hops
and
roasty
cocoa
blend
perfectly
in
the
nose
huge
pine
sap
simcoe
hop
flavor
with
the
nice
roasty
fudge
flavor
of
carafa
or
black
patent
malt
the
flavors
are
in
perfect
harmony
with
one
another
its
rich
and
bitter
all
at
once
full
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
one
of
the
best
imo
d
easy
to
finish
and
i
wish
the
glass
was
larger
ive
tried
this
not
too
long
ago
when
it
was
stone
11
glad
i
can
try
it
fresher
now
look
for
a
bottle
review
soon
im
so
glad
that
stone
is
on
the
shelves
here
enjoyed
every
bit
of
the
glass
highly
recommended
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
both
pine
and
citrus
as
well
as
a
toasted
caramel
malt
the
appearance
is
black
with
a
large
foamy
head
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
huge
hop
kick
but
not
a
super
astringent
one
the
palate
is
thin
but
smooth
from
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
good
but
a
bit
too
hoppy
for
me
d
not
all
too
high
but
something
nice
if
youre
tired
of
straightup
hop
bombs
or
sweet
stouts
im
not
going
to
seek
this
one
out
but
if
its
in
front
of
me
ill
drink
it
d
ill
finish
off
the
growler
but
im
starting
to
feel
it
after
too
glasses
edit
this
review
was
written
in
2010
as
of
2014
this
beer
is
much
more
common
and
im
quite
happy
as
its
become
one
of
my
goto
favorite
american
beers
i
have
revised
my
ratings
accordingly
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
what
modern
american
craft
breweries
are
capable
of
bringing
to
the
table
d
wow
this
starts
out
as
a
great
beer
but
its
also
a
fatiguing
beer
its
so
big
and
aggressive
that
its
not
easy
to
finish
a
22oz
bottle
in
one
sitting
but
its
still
a
really
nice
beer
and
im
glad
i
can
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
overall
this
is
my
least
favorite
stone
beer
i
have
had
to
date
hops
were
incredibly
bitter
and
not
balanced
to
what
i
thought
i
had
an
ipa
directly
after
this
and
it
tasted
like
water
i
had
no
idea
this
beer
would
be
like
this
i
think
they
were
too
aggressive
on
this
one
and
i
will
not
be
buying
this
again
anytime
soon
poured
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
2
fingers
of
light
tan
head
black
and
sticky
looking
smells
of
mango
peaches
citrus
hops
coffee
and
alcohol
a
little
hot
on
the
nose
but
otherwise
perfect
tastes
like
mango
bitter
hop
flavor
and
a
bit
of
toasted
malt
vaguely
coffeelike
slightly
sweet
on
the
finish
but
mostly
bitter
chocolate
and
hop
alcohol
is
prevalent
but
imminently
drinkable
for
a
beer
at
8
7
abv
delicious
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
my
compadre
who
tastes
a
6040
blend
of
tomaco
porter
and
coffeed
ruination
silly
friend
ive
only
had
a
couple
black
ipas
well
i
guess
i
can
call
them
american
style
india
black
ales
since
the
brewers
association
revised
the
style
guidelines
today
and
they
have
been
all
over
the
board
in
terms
of
successfully
blending
the
flavors
together
this
one
is
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
so
far
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
sudsy
tan
head
smell
is
super
crisp
citrusy
and
sweet
a
bunch
of
grapefruit
in
the
taste
and
other
assorted
hoppy
layers
hard
to
believe
all
this
is
coming
from
such
a
dark
brew
the
malt
is
pretty
subdued
but
does
add
a
mellowness
the
body
and
finish
bitterness
expectedly
rears
up
at
the
end
maybe
a
little
clash
of
characters
and
except
for
a
touch
of
alcohol
burn
drinks
quite
easy
for
8
7
pours
a
dark
brownmahogany
color
with
a
good
tan
head
nice
piney
hoppy
aromas
compete
with
undertones
of
roasted
malt
on
the
palate
this
one
boasts
a
good
malt
backbone
with
roasted
malt
cocoa
dark
chocolate
easily
mingling
with
some
good
pinecitrus
hop
flavors
a
very
nicely
balanced
beer
and
one
that
is
way
to
dangerous
drinkable
for
its
abv
excellent
dispite
the
8
7
i
feel
i
could
put
back
one
after
another
and
still
ask
for
more
d
very
good
i
recently
had
a
st
iniquity
which
is
considered
a
dipa
but
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
much
more
accurate
representation
of
the
style
than
iniquity
however
this
beer
decides
to
be
classified
i
believe
any
hophead
would
find
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
d
wow
this
beer
is
somewhat
of
a
paradox
its
pitch
black
tastes
like
a
big
ipa
has
some
touches
of
porterstout
like
qualities
but
it
all
comes
together
with
the
hops
very
nice
brew
will
drink
again
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
oily
but
somewhat
thin
all
in
all
a
solid
product
from
an
excellent
brewery
that
is
worthy
of
praise
poured
a
fairly
tame
head
some
solid
roasted
malt
aroma
damn
near
a
stout
in
my
opinion
fairly
bitter
aftertaste
and
definitely
alcohol
heavy
certainly
worth
a
try
if
nothing
else
stone
always
delivers
with
entertaining
bottling
nice
mix
of
hops
as
well
a
strong
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
that
is
how
stone
likes
it
overall
i
dont
have
much
more
to
add
here
this
is
a
good
beer
one
it
might
be
interesting
to
age
but
it
doesnt
quite
hit
that
elusive
sweet
spot
for
me
the
so
called
black
ipas
seem
to
be
more
gimmicks
than
anything
it
seems
like
no
brewers
have
taken
the
time
to
make
the
perfect
recipe
for
it
aaaand
it
tastes
pretty
much
like
it
smells
interesting
but
hugely
offbalanced
theres
some
herbs
thrown
in
there
along
with
the
big
giant
alpha
of
citrusy
west
coast
hops
thats
nice
the
whole
front
half
is
excellent
actually
but
then
in
the
back
its
a
thick
syrupy
malt
thats
just
not
all
that
great
overall
theres
a
lot
more
good
than
bad
but
the
bad
still
spoils
much
of
the
good
poured
a
fantastic
opaque
black
with
some
excellent
head
and
nice
lacing
very
deep
malty
scent
huge
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
nose
great
taste
a
deep
and
malty
hit
slight
roastiness
with
an
excellent
hop
hit
at
the
end
to
balance
it
all
a
wonderfully
smooth
beer
with
no
alcohol
tinge
even
at
over
eight
percent
an
excellent
brew
cheers
over
all
this
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
is
definitely
delicious
and
worth
trying
i
would
most
definitely
buy
this
beer
again
first
beer
i
had
at
new
good
beer
bar
in
cambridge
lord
hobo
caught
my
eye
as
a
black
ipa
my
new
favorite
style
on
tap
into
12
oz
tulip
glass
pours
black
with
creamy
off
whie
head
lots
of
lacing
going
down
very
nice
smell
is
mainly
floral
to
me
taste
is
great
but
i
was
having
a
hard
time
pinning
it
down
citrus
coffee
roasted
recent
reviews
describing
it
as
ipa
up
front
and
stouth
at
the
end
are
dead
on
wish
i
had
come
up
with
that
on
my
own
thin
but
not
watery
feel
with
nice
warming
feel
from
the
alcohol
excellent
brew
but
one
is
good
for
me
already
feelin
this
one
i
like
the
idea
behind
this
beer
and
where
they
are
trying
to
go
with
it
intentions
are
good
dark
bitter
malty
fruity
it
is
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
stout
from
what
i
can
tell
its
good
a
very
strong
beer
complex
with
a
strong
finish
sort
of
coffeelike
at
the
end
leaves
a
slight
after
taste
i
must
admit
at
the
first
sip
i
was
disappointed
i
have
learned
to
expect
great
things
from
stone
but
after
i
started
to
drink
it
it
grew
on
me
and
i
enjoyed
it
great
pourappearance
consistency
for
the
price
they
charge
i
am
not
sure
id
buy
this
again
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
solid
beer
but
it
is
overpriced
i
think
you
could
get
alot
better
value
for
the
money
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
mainly
because
of
the
price
not
taste
drinkability
superb
a
new
fav
of
mine
d
this
one
holds
up
well
ive
had
it
in
a
bomber
id
have
to
say
its
even
better
on
tap
with
a
bit
of
age
on
it
d
if
you
like
ipas
you
love
this
beer
very
good
hoppy
brew
from
stone
its
more
of
a
dark
ipa
than
a
strong
ale
i
can
only
handle
one
of
these
at
a
time
i
wouldnt
drink
this
all
the
time
but
it
is
something
i
wouldnt
mind
coming
back
to
i
need
to
trade
for
another
one
of
these
or
maybe
age
a
sublimely
self
righteous
pours
a
dark
ruby
mahogony
with
a
tan
frothy
head
the
head
is
large
with
lacing
that
lasts
a
long
time
the
smell
is
a
very
strong
citrus
hops
with
some
pine
aromas
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
a
very
good
mixture
with
alcohol
and
bread
yeast
that
makes
a
very
tasty
beer
the
mf
is
medium
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
very
well
another
in
the
long
line
of
very
good
stone
beers
overall
this
is
another
good
beer
by
stone
again
stone
puts
out
another
beer
i
like
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
my
way
for
i
guess
i
am
a
little
confused
with
my
styles
this
is
classified
as
an
american
strong
ale
but
i
thought
it
was
a
black
ipa
until
i
read
the
description
what
ever
it
is
the
beer
is
solid
and
would
recommend
it
to
hop
lovers
a
solid
brew
with
interesting
flavors
and
roast
its
hard
for
stone
to
do
wrong
this
beer
has
characteristics
of
a
black
ipa
and
a
barleywine
i
can
sense
double
bastard
and
old
guardian
in
the
mix
next
time
my
fridge
is
nearing
empty
ill
pick
up
a
bomber
of
sublimely
selfrighteous
d
wow
this
beer
impresses
from
the
first
whiff
of
the
aroma
and
doesnt
let
up
until
long
after
the
last
drop
is
gone
the
hop
aroma
is
spectacular
with
a
very
intense
and
fresh
pine
note
that
is
much
less
colored
by
dark
malt
than
i
would
have
expected
based
on
the
style
and
the
color
the
flavor
is
quite
a
bit
darker
and
more
typical
of
the
style
though
no
less
excellent
there
is
a
very
nice
balance
between
caramel
malts
and
citrus
hops
as
well
as
between
harsh
acrid
bitterness
and
a
subtle
restrained
sweetness
that
appears
at
just
the
right
moments
to
encourage
your
palate
to
endure
the
assault
and
keep
the
beer
drinkable
this
is
one
of
the
most
surprising
complex
and
well
balanced
american
strong
ales
that
i
have
come
across
and
it
is
one
of
stones
best
efforts
which
is
obviously
saying
a
lot
a
must
try
this
is
quite
an
interesting
beer
from
stone
but
not
one
i
could
drink
all
the
time
considering
the
higher
abv
and
strong
hop
character
id
say
youd
be
done
after
1
or
2
of
these
ipa
fans
will
love
this
everyone
else
has
quite
the
adventure
ahead
of
them
tastes
d
delicious
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
good
balance
upfront
with
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
which
i
enjoy
smell
combines
all
sorts
of
complex
hops
and
dark
malt
bittersweet
odors
with
highoctane
ethanol
only
the
yeast
hides
from
strenuous
sniffing
taste
is
just
totally
perfect
we
hardly
want
to
swallow
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smoothly
satinlined
comfy
cozy
unctuous
we
had
to
get
a
bag
of
gourmet
pretzels
to
eat
with
this
drink
it
was
so
powerfully
persistent
in
its
sweet
malty
bitter
aftertaste
the
palate
begs
mercy
at
7
per
pint
the
price
and
yes
ive
read
the
blogs
where
rich
dudes
claim
you
shouldnt
ever
consider
expense
in
drinkable
considerations
is
too
steep
for
us
to
want
more
than
one
pint
per
day
but
the
brew
itself
is
so
extremely
intense
we
wouldnt
want
to
indulge
in
more
than
a
single
pint
even
if
we
didnt
both
have
to
get
back
on
our
tandem
bike
and
pedal
3
miles
steep
uphill
to
get
home
with
it
glowing
darkly
like
a
black
hole
star
in
our
contented
bellies
generally
i
disapprove
of
sending
beer
longdistance
sorry
mental
problems
with
diesel
transport
interfere
with
my
palate
but
thanks
stone
for
the
audacity
of
shipping
that
truly
sublime
ale
all
the
way
from
san
diego
to
ithaca
overall
even
with
all
the
hop
flavors
subdued
the
strong
roasted
malt
and
bittering
hops
still
make
for
a
great
flavor
profile
very
nice
balance
here
a
well
ages
much
better
than
most
beers
with
such
a
strong
hop
profile
i
enjoy
it
highly
drinkable
and
really
for
the
hops
lover
overall
pretty
decent
its
an
ipa
that
isnt
if
your
an
ipa
search
this
out
another
over
hopped
beer
from
stone
this
one
could
be
a
case
of
a
little
less
would
be
a
lot
more
this
one
just
doesnt
stand
out
from
the
rest
of
their
offerings
d
very
drinkable
and
well
made
d
very
drinkable
for
such
an
assertive
brew
robust
yet
refined
and
beautifully
layered
this
tastes
just
like
a
hoppy
west
coast
ipa
there
is
a
good
amount
of
malty
sweetness
but
it
is
still
very
hoppy
it
is
hard
to
reconcile
the
flavor
with
the
color
but
if
i
close
my
eyes
i
consider
this
an
above
average
ipa
mouthfeel
is
fairly
viscous
and
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
very
adroitly
behind
the
substantial
hoppiness
d
overall
i
enjoyed
my
first
bottle
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
well
hidden
wouldnt
have
guessed
that
this
offering
was
8
7
abv
looking
forward
to
having
the
second
bottle
that
i
have
purchased
in
the
near
future
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
yet
drinks
quite
well
pretty
laid
back
for
stone
and
not
at
a
price
to
break
the
wallet
looking
not
to
destroy
the
taste
buds
but
have
a
nice
beer
with
a
mild
hop
kick
try
some
d
this
is
a
slow
drinker
dont
taste
the
alcohol
which
is
good
for
a
higherish
abv
beer
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
it
like
i
expected
in
total
a
very
high
quality
offering
from
stone
in
their
catalouge
i
put
it
slightly
below
their
13
aniv
ale
and
their
ris
and
slightly
above
arrogant
bastard
will
be
looking
to
get
my
hands
on
this
one
again
d
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
sipping
beer
this
really
needs
to
be
tried
at
cellarroom
temp
15deg
celcius
would
not
be
too
warm
too
cold
and
this
is
just
extremely
hoppy
bitter
and
astringent
d
this
was
very
interesting
i
wouldnt
even
know
how
to
classify
this
one
but
it
was
great
bold
malt
flavors
pairing
nicely
with
bright
citrus
hop
flavors
another
well
done
brew
by
stone
this
brew
is
certainly
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
to
offer
the
senses
this
is
a
delicious
beer
at
a
great
price
this
is
basically
a
black
dipa
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
sublimely
selfrighteous
kinda
wish
id
tried
them
back
to
back
d
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
damn
fine
strong
ale
not
shy
by
any
means
to
a
fault
one
after
one
glass
down
i
feel
like
my
mouth
has
been
beat
up
i
will
definitely
seek
this
out
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
some
delicious
punishment
medium
bodied
and
surprisingly
quite
dry
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
carbonated
to
add
life
to
the
mouthfeel
short
and
sweet
finish
drinks
greatzero
hint
of
its
8
7not
what
i
would
call
sessionable
but
definitely
very
drinkable
ddrinkable
sure
and
while
this
is
not
one
id
do
back
to
back
ill
definately
score
one
of
these
again
to
me
stone
has
become
a
bit
of
a
one
trick
pony
albeit
a
highly
skilled
high
quality
one
but
i
always
look
forward
to
their
one
offs
and
occasional
brews
i
dig
when
someone
breaks
the
mold
this
type
of
mouthfeel
with
this
kind
of
hopping
appearance
and
taste
come
on
and
so
while
a
bit
of
an
oddball
there
will
always
be
a
place
for
this
one
in
my
cellar
this
one
had
a
bit
of
age
on
it
better
late
than
never
i
suppose
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
hoppy
aromas
smacked
my
face
beautiful
cola
brown
pour
with
a
nice
light
mocha
head
swirl
bings
a
bit
of
that
back
up
taste
is
almost
all
hops
but
a
bit
more
of
an
aftertaste
some
stone
fruits
almost
a
back
taste
of
prunes
brown
sugar
subtle
though
because
it
is
the
hop
power
that
shine
through
and
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
not
that
it
matters
because
the
mouthfeel
is
so
smooth
like
many
stone
beers
this
has
a
smooth
and
full
body
that
lend
itself
to
easy
drinking
alcohol
is
a
nonissue
the
only
thing
holding
you
back
is
your
feeling
about
hoppy
beers
this
was
gone
in
no
time
i
prefer
this
to
a
double
ipa
which
is
just
too
much
hops
for
me
to
take
any
more
this
and
stones
cali
will
take
care
of
my
little
hop
fixes
nicely
falls
somewhere
between
a
barleywine
and
a
black
ipa
big
and
winey
but
still
very
drinkable
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
body
with
a
dense
beige
head
on
top
it
has
a
nice
aroma
with
chocolate
coffee
sweetness
and
dried
fruits
as
well
as
a
lovely
hop
profile
with
pine
resin
and
citrus
mostly
orange
chocolate
and
coffee
flavor
rather
burnt
with
fruity
hop
flavors
citrus
notes
pine
and
resin
full
rather
dry
mouthfeel
and
a
long
piney
and
resiny
finish
with
citrus
this
is
one
of
those
lovely
beers
with
layers
and
layers
of
aroma
and
flavor
the
aroma
being
the
best
of
those
though
im
happy
they
modeled
this
beer
after
the
11th
anniversary
ale
it
was
my
favorite
stone
beer
to
date
it
pours
black
as
cola
with
a
thick
sandy
head
smell
of
wonderful
hoppyness
while
being
fairly
strong
its
imposibly
smooth
going
down
albeit
intensely
hoppy
this
one
is
deffinetly
worth
a
repeat
this
goes
well
with
a
sweet
and
meaty
entree

say

richard
na
zdravje
d
overall
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
definitely
worth
seeking
out
highly
recommended
the
bitter
hops
its
a
mouthful
drinkability
this
is
a
great
sipping
ale
and
with
its
relatively
low
alcohol
content
for
the
style
means
youll
be
able
to
have
more
than
one
beer
this
night
dm
fairly
drinkable
for
the
strength
super
creamy
and
smooth
love
the
mouthfeel
this
was
nearly
identical
to
ssr
but
without
as
much
lacing
not
my
favorite
stone
offering
but
an
interesting
experience
nonetheless
this
is
a
big
beer
with
decent
drinkability
im
not
about
to
pound
a
sixer
of
this
but
a
bomber
will
do
just
fine
drinkability
enjoyable
beer
and
the
abv
is
not
distracting
another
great
brew
from
stone
i
have
high
expectations
for
anything
stone
produces
so
im
probably
a
bit
more
critical
as
a
result
this
is
an
interesting
beer
residing
in
some
betweenstyles
realm
id
probably
peg
is
closest
to
a
black
ipa
nice
hopping
and
would
like
to
have
seen
just
a
bit
more
character
here
nicely
moderated
roasted
malt
flavor
cheers
drinakabillity
lovely
hop
taste
and
aroma
strong
proof
who
cares
the
taste
makes
you
want
to
have
more
picked
up
another
bottle
of
this
last
weekend
and
it
must
have
been
a
lot
fresher
then
my
previous
one
very
hop
bitter
and
quite
delicious
really
suprised
me
this
time
a
deep
red
full
bodied
ale
that
barely
allows
any
light
to
pass
through
her
a
near
brown
head
forms
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
i
poured
the
brew
quite
aggressively
and
the
thin
cap
of
head
is
all
the
remains
after
the
large
bubbled
cloud
has
quickly
gone
the
smells
and
aroma
are
pleasant
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
stone
is
that
too
meant
to
be
sublime
i
was
waiting
for
a
punch
to
the
nostrils
with
hops
and
grain
i
was
quite
delighted
by
the
taste
however
near
9
abv
and
the
most
i
get
is
notes
of
coffee
and
sharp
hop
bitterness
that
clings
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
long
after
the
sip
has
passed
the
is
a
very
simple
tasting
brew
to
me
dark
roasted
flavors
come
to
mind
with
each
taste
but
the
hop
bitterness
dominates
d
while
not
sessionable
this
beer
does
go
down
quite
smooth
especially
for
a
fairly
high
abv
d
the
alcohol
is
no
more
or
less
present
than
it
was
initially
and
the
beer
is
still
quite
good
i
liked
it
better
fresh
obviously
but
this
one
has
held
up
surprisingly
well
d
i
really
liked
this
strong
ale
i
thought
the
taste
was
very
complex
and
interesting
and
i
really
liked
the
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
flavors
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
pours
very
dark
almost
completely
opaque
with
just
a
little
red
around
the
edges
when
held
up
to
the
light
slightly
tan
head
with
great
lacing
aroma
of
grapefruit
pine
and
dark
malt
sweetness
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
plenty
of
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
hop
character
and
a
nice
slightly
roasty
malt
sweetness
dark
malts
seem
well
incorporated
with
just
a
little
bit
of
graininess
in
the
finish
and
some
alcoholic
warmth
very
tasty
and
silky
smooth
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
while
not
exactly
a
session
beer
does
go
down
fairly
easily
an
excellent
brew
thanks
to
cavedave
for
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
this
one
ipas
arent
my
favorite
style
yes
i
do
enjoy
a
good
one
such
as
dogfish
but
im
no
hop
head
i
prefer
malts
given
that
this
ipastyled
brew
still
amazed
me
its
a
bit
like
picasso
it
doesnt
end
up
being
what
it
seems
it
surprises
you
on
two
levels
the
appearance
and
taste
are
on
opposite
ends
of
the
spectrum
then
on
top
of
that
both
elements
are
fantastic
in
their
own
right
it
looks
like
a
glorious
afterdinner
stout
but
tastes
like
a
topnotch
flavorful
and
summery
ipa
definitely
one
of
the
coolest
beers
out
there
i
may
not
end
up
buying
it
much
because
its
a
bit
intense
but
it
sure
impressed
me
a
ton
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
ive
tried
in
months
and
i
try
quite
a
few
each
month
how
about
a
round
of
applause
for
stone
this
is
another
one
of
those
unique
brews
that
satisfies
completely
super
sweet
to
the
nose
and
then
a
bitter
smack
in
the
face
rich
caramel
head
and
smooth
finish
i
really
dug
the
uniqueness
of
this
beer
when
poured
the
the
jet
black
visual
instantly
makes
you
think
you
are
about
to
drink
a
porter
i
couldnt
believe
the
difference
between
the
smell
and
taste
i
just
found
out
that
stone
will
be
brewing
this
beer
year
round
so
ill
definitely
have
it
on
tap
all
the
time
nice
brew
another
job
well
done
by
stone
i
dont
think
that
mitch
and
stone
could
have
sent
me
a
better
brew
this
is
fantastic
as
a
substyle
black
ipas
always
strike
a
cord
with
me

d
definitely
have
no
problem
putting
this
beer
down
has
a
bit
of
every
aspect
i
look
for
in
a
good
beer
and
i
will
definitely
be
picking
this
one
up
again
as
long
as
i
can

you
have

this
beer
rocks
had
this
on
tap
at
the
legendary
herot
in
downtown
muncie
nice
beer
from
stone
that
delivers
your
typical
stone
hops
but
this
one
is
not
too
in
your
face
like
many
of
their
beers
are
maybe
they
have
learned
to
tone
down
the
hops
just
a
little
to
kmake
their
beers
more
drinkable
nice
hop
aroma
with
citrus

to

this
is

i
was
not
impressed
maybe
i
would
have
been
a
little
more
impressed
by
a
beer
from
a
lesser
brewery
but
this
is
by
far
a
low
point
for
stone
i
bought
two
cases
and
enjoy
every
bottle
as
much
as
the
previous

you
can
find

i
dont
know
what
kind
of
beer
this
is
its
more
like
a
dark
imperial
ipa
possibly
the
best
stone
beer
ever
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
with
about
a
half
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
mostly
citrusy
grapefruit
and
pine
hops
but
theres
also
some
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
dark
fruit
noticable
the
beer
tastes
pretty
much
just
like
the
aroma
its
mostly
hoppy
but
theres
enough
malt
in
there
that
you
can
taste
those
flavors
too
theres
also
a
good
lingering
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
somewhat
creamy
and
coating
and
is
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
great
its
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
id
buy
it
again
in
the
future
dark
brown
with
a
tan
head
showing
some
good
retention
lots
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
aroma
with
some
pine
and
citrus
note
taking
the
lead
citrus
again
on
the
palate
with
orangelemon
peel
type
bitterness
thats
backed
by
a
subtle
malt
sweetness
definitely
hopforward
but
it
shows
a
considerable
amount
of
balance
despite
being
less
than
subtle
sounds
contradictory
i
guess
but
its
a
unique
beer
to
be
sure
and
while
not
the
greatest
stone
offering
its
definitely
a
good
beer
that
deserves
a
try
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
the
aroma
was
a
musty
bitter
sorry
cant
do
any
better
than
that
the
taste
was
bitter
citruspine
needles
a
little
bitter
for
me
but
not
bad
the
feel
was
full
bodied
with
more
than
sufficient
carbonation
drinkability
was
pretty
good
especially
if
you
are
into
hops
not
a
lot
of
difference
as
it
warmed
up
still
a
good
beer
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
this
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
color
had
a
medium
head
that
fell
quickly
and
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
all
hops
almost
all
citrus
with
just
a
touch
of
dark
malty
sweetness
in
the
background
the
flavor
was
much
the
same
a
touch
of
malty
sweetness
but
a
ton
of
citrus
and
floral
hop
flavors
and
a
lingering
bitterness
the
body
was
medium
and
the
drinkability
was
good
a
great
beer
well
balanced
with
a
very
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
the
hops
and
malt
combine
to
make
a
wonderful
combination
of
flavors
that
are
just
about
perfect
for
a
strong
ale
its
like
arrogant
bastard
refined
but
on
steroids
stone
strikes
again
and
we
are
the
lucky
ones
the
pour
is
gorgeous
black
with
a
dense
dark
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
on
the
nose
the
hops
are
still
so
fresh
yes
its
been
in
a
40
degree
fridge
for
a
while
but
the
piney
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
fruit
character
apricot
and
peach
really
works
well
with
the
deep
roasted
malt
character
with
coffee
and
chocolate
great
balance
on
the
palate
the
flavors
are
replicated
with
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
present
with
pine
and
a
little
citrus
before
a
gorgeous
wave
of
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
a
little
sweetness
come
in
in
some
ways
almost
stout
like
medium
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
long
finish
with
a
great
balance
between
hop
and
malt
bitterness
this
beer
is
fantastic
id
drink
a
lot
more
but
i
have
just
one
bottle
left
this
beer
poured
an
almost
pitch
black
but
with
some
light
barely
getting
through
if
formed
a
huge
foamy
medium
tan
head
and
formed
circular
lace
as
it
slowly
subsided
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
pine
and
grapefruit
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
the
body
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
reflects
the
astringency
of
the
hops
d
fantastic
easily
one
of
the
best
dark
hoppy
beers
ive
had
i
was
surprised
to
see
this
categorized
under
strong
ale
instead
of
ipa
either
way
this
is
an
awesome
brew
with
a
huge
pineapple
character
d
a
really
good
black
ipa
style
ale
it
provides
a
complex
and
interesting
mix
of
aromas
and
flavors
with
signature
stone
quality
quite
an
intense
brew
huge
amounts
of
dark
roasted
malts
gives
off
a
coffeeish
flavor
of
course
it
also
comes
with
big
hops
both
citrus
and
pine
maybe
just
a
little
more
citrus
fairly
bitter
dark
fruits
mainly
prunes
not
exactly
amazing
but
somewhat
interesting
and
unique
i
would
say
pretty
good
overall
what
can
i
say
this
beer
is
great
call
it
a
black
ipa
or
an
american
strong
ale
or
whatever
you
want
its
a
big
gutsy
beer
that
will
blow
you
away
and
wash
clean
any
assumptions
you
might
have
about
dark
beer
find
this
beer
if
you
can
a
very
dark
beer
i
held
it
agaist
several
light
sources
to
no
avail
very
nice
perfume
piney
and
citrucy
except
youre
too
busy
salivating
to
the
hoppy
bitterness
to
notice
during
the
first
few
sips
once
you
catch
up
to
this
brew
you
start
to
fully
enjoy
it
the
flavor
masks
its
alcohol
content
and
at
8
7
be
mindful
you
might
not
want
to
have
too
many
of
these
unless
youve
got
a
designated
driver
id
say
its
pretty
drinkable
as
things
like
this
go
hell
i
had
3
of
them
i
must
have
liked
drinking
it
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
especially
for
those
that
love
the
combination
of
juicy
fruit
hops
and
roasted
malts
for
me
i
typically
dont
like
to
mix
the
two
but
this
one
worked
out
to
say
the
least
stone
hid
the
alcohol
extremely
well
in
this
beer
huge
marks
for
drinkability
as
it
did
not
become
cloying
or
repetitive
i
wish
stone
could
make
this
a
seasonal
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
i
think
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
it
is
smooth
yet
packs
just
enough
hop
bite
to
make
it
interesting
keeps
pulling
me
back
in
nice
work
stone
im
not
a
hops
person
but
i
can
see
this
beer
being
high
marks
for
whoever
is
tastes
like
stone
met
their
mark
here
d
with
how
smoothly
this
goes
down
and
sporting
an
8
7abv
this
could
be
trouble
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
the
beer
poured
well
the
head
kept
longer
than
i
could
wait
to
drink
it
this
beer
had
one
of
the
most
intense
and
pleasing
aromas
of
a
beer
in
a
long
time
mouthfeel
was
pleasingly
thick
with
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
taste
suggested
dark
burnt
candy
rasins
and
coffee
could
feel
the
alcohol
warmth
after
first
sip
gulp
very
good
beer
but
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
these
kinds
are
beer
are
trouble
because
they
go
down
so
smooth
and
have
that
flat
like
finish
that
you
end
up
pounding
a
few
and
find
yourself
a
bit
loaded
but
well
worth
it
i
had
samples
of
the
11th
when
it
came
out
but
i
never
got
around
to
writing
a
review
on
it
at
the
time
i
wasnt
feeling
the
dark
ipa
for
some
reason
this
bottle
changed
all
of
those
feelings
i
had
this
beer
nailed
the
dark
roasts
and
the
bold
american
hops
stone
is
perfect
i
just
had
the
stone
13th
and
that
was
pretty
lackluster
and
definitely
carried
no
finesse
this
on
poured
a
pitch
black
body
with
no
ruby
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
it
did
have
a
big
tan
foaming
head
that
rose
well
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
lacing
was
even
and
retention
was
excellent
great
looking
brew
from
escondido
aromatics
hit
a
solid
blast
of
pine
and
herbal
hops
with
citrus
following
close
behind
sweet
baked
goods
with
cocoa
dry
powder
definitely
roasted
malt
characterstics
wtihout
much
coffee
action
flavor
was
layered
between
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
aggressive
hop
bitterness
that
did
manage
to
work
some
citrus
pine
resin
and
herbal
dirty
hop
flavors
came
about
between
layers
of
dark
chocolate
cake
it
was
a
good
mix
with
moderate
alcohol
burn
coming
through
mouthfeel
was
big
but
not
chewy
carbonation
was
tight
bubbled
it
carried
the
brew
very
well
not
overdone
pretty
natural
smoothness
going
on
with
a
soothing
dry
finish
between
roasted
malt
and
bittering
hops
drinkability
overall
was
excellent
another
great
reintroduction
to
stones
black
ipa
i
had
iniquity
last
night
from
southern
tier
and
im
diggin
the
dark
hoppy
beers
if
you
see
this
grab
it
worth
the
extra
bucks
for
the
bomber
to
get
the
real
deal
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
a
little
sticky
not
flat
but
heavy
fairly
drinkable
i
had
been
staring
at
this
beer
in
my
refrigerator
all
weekend
then
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
open
last
night
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
the
brewers
at
the
stone
brewing
company
located
in
escondido
ca
pride
themselves
on
being
able
to
consistently
produce
such
fine
works
of
art
like
this
truly
selfrighteous
ale
this
beer
was
first
produced
in
2007
as
their
annual
anniversary
edition
release
and
was
such
a
huge
hit
they
had
to
make
more
when
you
poor
it
into
the
glass
the
color
is
black
as
pitch
with
nose
that
similar
to
most
imperial
ipas
with
notes
of
grapefruit
that
dissipate
to
hints
of
red
fruits
the
palate
was
bitter
but
a
balanced
bitterness
that
comes
from
both
the
hops
and
malts
with
hints
of
cranberries
in
the
beginning
and
finishes
long
and
dry
abv
8
7
this
is
a
great
beer
ab
like
but
even
more
over
the
top
and
better
balanced
enjoy
however
you
wish
to
classify
this
beer
american
strong
ale
vs
black
ipa
its
not
bad
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
kept
thinking
about
how
to
differentiate
this
beer
from
arrogant
bastard
and
really
i
could
only
convince
myself
that
the
appearance
was
the
most
distinguishing
factor
otherwise
i
though
the
flavor
profiles
were
remarkably
similar
not
a
bad
thing
since
both
beers
are
quite
tasty
that
being
said
its
a
unique
hybrid
style
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
if
i
see
it
again
id
like
to
give
it
another
try
just
to
see
if
i
can
try
to
further
distinguish
it
from
the
ab
taste
is
so
mind
blasting
at
9abv
stone
comes
through
again
by
making
a
very
drinkable
strong
ale
that
hides
the
booze
very
well
its
hard
to
describe
the
complex
flavors
but
its
like
drinking
a
blended
imperial
ipa
with
ris
the
hops
come
through
up
front
with
grapefruit
bite
with
a
very
coffee
malty
and
chocolate
aftertaste
what
a
beer
my
friends
very
complex
and
satisfying
if
you
like
imperial
stouts
and
ipas
this
beer
will
not
disappoint
you
drinkability
still
somewhat
hot
from
the
alcohol
which
i
thought
would
have
mellowed
a
bit
more
still
tasty
and
easy
on
the
way
down
and
a
great
brew
for
a
hot
summer
night
unexpected
is
the
word
for
this
beer
very
hard
to
believe
it
is
almost
9
abv
since
it
drinks
like
nice
summer
time
brew
with
a
tip
to
a
porter
sweet
citrusy
balanced
flavorful
this
is
not
exactly
the
powerhouse
i
expect
from
stone
but
i
like
it
stealthy
a
strong
long
lasting
hop
and
bitter
coffee
finish
all
around
very
bright
hops
full
bright
flavored
and
wonderfully
drinkable
d
decent
stuff
but
somehow
unoriginal
the
bitterness
is
pretty
rough
but
the
mouthfeel
provides
a
great
delivery
of
the
flavors
at
hand
for
such
a
black
beer
i
would
expect
more
malt
presence
which
hinders
the
brew
a
little
still
a
solid
offering
from
stone
a
22
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
the
ale
appears
a
dark
translucent
brown
color
with
about
an
inch
of
light
ecru
foam
nose
and
flavor
consist
of
lemon
peelrind
orange
roasted
grains
caramelmolasses
fruity
plums
raisins
the
ale
falls
somewhere
between
medium
and
full
bodied
with
more
than
adequate
carbonation
very
nice
coming
along
quite
well
very
interesting
brew
from
a
great
brewery
served
a
black
nearly
opaque
body
with
a
thin
ecru
head
that
leaves
sticky
lacing
plenty
of
roastiness
pineapple
dark
roast
coffee
in
the
nose
flavors
explode
on
the
tongue
sweet
up
front
then
hoppy
tropical
fruit
followed
by
a
bitterness
that
says
i
am
righteous
here
to
stay
solid
mouthfeel
on
the
lushly
full
not
thick
side
a
one
and
done
due
to
the
abv
d
another
great
offering
from
stone
a
very
unique
and
very
tasty
brew
thats
worth
a
try
and
probably
a
revist
or
two
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
with
just
enough
bittering
to
wipe
away
the
cloying
excellent
drinkability
is
quite
nice
as
well
this
bomber
went
fast
this
is
a
sipping
beer
that
i
do
not
feel
i
could
drink
more
than
1
or
2
of
in
a
night
but
i
sure
as
hell
would
enjoy
those
2
stone
has
a
winner
here
call
it
the
summer
beer
for
stout
lovers
you
can
have
your
refreshing
hoppy
taste
and
have
people
still
think
you
are
drinking
a
stout
a
definite
must
for
any
ipa
drinker
recommended
by
my
beertender
since
he
knew
how
big
of
a
hop
head
busted
one
out
that
night
and
i
bought
them
out
enjoy
a
bit
darker
than
the
13th
anniversary
in
taste
and
appearance
but
this
brew
follows
along
that
line
and
should
appeal
ton
anyone
who
likes
that
or
any
of
stones
hoppy
goodness
great
mouthfeel
with
perfect
carbonation
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
little
too
much
of
this
in
a
session
i
admit
that
i
am
a
hophead
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
little
too
hop
forward
for
the
style
the
roasty
notes
were
low
in
the
mix
and
could
really
use
a
boost
in
all
this
was
a
pretty
sweet
little
secret
i
found
up
in
ypsi
large
head
slowly
works
down
to
around
one
finger
while
it
is
mostly
miniscule
bubbles
you
get
oddly
sized
larger
bubbles
here
and
there
and
the
head
does
dimple
in
spots
almost
sheets
of
lacing
down
the
sides
thick
and
clingy
light
brown
in
hue
completely
and
i
mean
completely
black
in
color
youd
think
it
was
a
stout
by
looking
at
the
glass
then
you
smell
and
wham
the
hops
slap
you
upside
the
head
all
pink
grapefruit
pine
needles
tropical
pineapple
guava
papaya
nectarine
fruit
the
floral
side
the
weakest
hops
element
yields
to
burnt
biscuits
lightly
roasted
coffee
beans
and
peat
moss
in
the
mouth
its
fullbodied
muscularly
sinewy
and
gets
right
up
in
your
face
while
theres
no
getting
around
that
pink
to
white
grapefruit
pine
sap
licorice
and
bitters
here
theres
more
equanimity
shown
towards
the
roasted
malts
and
toasty
dough
elements
blends
in
coffee
bean
hard
toffee
and
a
nip
of
butterscotch
the
carbonation
more
prickly
than
anything
else
fits
in
with
the
overall
tingle
balance
for
stone
is
a
high
wire
act
blindfolded
but
this
one
comes
about
as
close
as
the
brewery
can
get
more
than
any
of
the
flavors
you
feel
the
energy
bristle
through
each
sip
d
this
a
pretty
strong
brew
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
apparent
this
almost
seems
like
a
desert
beer
i
could
imagine
having
this
with
a
ice
cream
covered
hot
cookie
desert
drinkable
for
certain
and
with
the
interesting
taste
it
presents
compared
to
the
usual
stone
lineup
around
here
i
could
have
more
than
one
easily
but
its
not
to
be
found
in
nj
for
the
most
part
taste
is
strong
dry
dark
fruits
touch
of
chocolate
a
little
caramel
sour
malt
lots
of
hops
a
little
licorice
a
tad
bit
of
citrus
and
a
woodiness
end
is
dry
and
very
bitter
same
style
as
arrogant
bastard
really
i
dont
see
it
this
is
closer
to
a
porter
by
my
taste
really
interesting
beer
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
but
none
the
less
it
had
a
very
unique
taste
kudos
to
stone
for
taking
it
out
of
the
box
yet
again
interesting
beer
that
has
many
different
flavors
to
contemplate
worth
a
try
but
make
sure
that
you
sip
it
d
refreshing
and
cant
taste
the
high
abv
i
nice
beer
but
what
else
would
you
expect
from
a
brewer
like
stone
once
again
this
company
does
not
disappoint
serving
a
very
good
and
rather
strong
beer
this
has
been
a
welcome
addition
to
the
imperial
ipas
that
i
have
been
ravenously
consuming
this
summer
i
will
certainly
be
picking
this
up
again
and
storing
a
few
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
age
does
to
it
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
tasted
in
a
while
m
fluffy
fizzy
medium
bodied
found
this
on
draft
at
the
mandalay
bay
burger
bar
after
they
disappointed
me
with
not
having
deschutes
mirror
mirror
worth
it
however
didnt
get
the
chocolate
as
much
as
expressed
but
an
excellent
double
ipa
with
some
maltiness
great
on
draft
in
a
goblet
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
caramel
malt
up
front
followed
by
a
gigantic
bitter
dryness
during
the
swallow
d
just
a
little
too
out
there
for
me
the
flavors
pull
my
tongue
in
so
many
directions
not
to
mention
the
amount
of
hops
has
pretty
much
decimated
my
tongue
that
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
is
hard
to
drink
a
lot
going
on
really
tasty
but
definitely
a
one
and
done
beer
for
me
will
seek
out
again
overall
a
really
good
beer
im
a
fan
of
india
brown
ales
and
this
beer
twists
that
style
up
a
notch
overall
an
excellent
and
slightly
bizarre
ale
a
bit
like
a
blend
of
schwarzbier
and
dipa
well
worth
a
try
pours
jet
black
with
a
booming
fluffy
lighttan
head
that
never
fully
dissolves
and
creates
a
dense
layer
atop
the
glass
the
aroma
is
filled
with
sticky
resinous
hops
and
has
some
hints
although
very
subtle
of
chocolate
flavor
is
piney
hops
and
sweet
malt
upfront
and
is
accompanied
by
some
touches
of
roasted
malt
and
dried
fruit
its
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
is
sticky
and
has
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
out
of
all
the
black
ipas
that
ive
tried
this
one
certainly
sets
the
bar
i
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
looked
like
before
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
and
was
surprised
it
was
as
black
as
it
was
the
aroma
is
purely
delicious
pitch
black
brew
tan
two
finger
head
with
significant
lacingthis
looks
good
chocolatey
roasty
malts
predominate
in
the
nose
and
beginning
of
the
taste
with
a
dry
hop
finish
more
of
sipper
than
quaffer
one
bomber
is
sufficient
thanks
i
certainly
like
this
more
than
arrogant
bastard
and
hope
stone
decides
to
brew
on
a
regular
basis
a
nice
example
of
the
style
most
certainly
worth
seeking
out
d
judging
it
based
on
the
style
listing
here
there
are
quite
a
few
strong
ales
that
are
probably
more
drinkable
if
you
threw
it
into
the
dipa
category
i
think
the
score
might
be
a
bit
higher
1x
this
one
toes
the
line
between
bitter
and
unpleasant
had
stone
made
this
any
bigger
i
dont
think
it
would
work
out
at
all
its
definitely
a
beer
that
grows
on
you
those
first
few
sips
are
almost
overwhelming
i
know
they
already
used
the
youre
not
worthy
line
for
arrogant
bastard
but
its
more
applicable
here
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
bad
ass
beer
22oz
bottle
at
flying
saucer
poured
into
a
duvel
glass
a
nice
opaque
black
with
a
nice
frothy
lighttan
head
that
diminishes
and
leaves
slight
lacing
aroma
is
a
subtle
amount
of
black
malts
and
crisp
hops
taste
is
very
nice
balance
of
black
malts
and
citrus
and
pine
hops
very
nice
complex
amount
of
flavors
with
bitter
cocoa
and
espresso
showing
up
nicely
as
well
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
the
alcohol
present
but
somewhat
hidden
i
got
to
try
11th
when
it
was
a
year
old
and
this
one
is
certainly
better
fresh
d
this
is
a
damn
drinkable
beer
the
growler
was
gone
all
too
quick
glad
they
bottle
this
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
overall
just
an
amazing
beer
if
you
loved
the
stone
xi
fresh
youll
love
this
beer

smelling
with

plenty
of
roasted

some

very

pretty
dry
medium

with

i
think
1
year
of
age
would
have
been
about
perfect
this
was
just
a
little
over
the
2
years
really
mellowed
the
hops
which
was
good
for
me
good
balance
of
malt
roast
and
hops
a
real
nice
drinker
with
only
slightly
high
abv
which
is
not
noticeable
at
all
anyways
from
what
i
understand
this
is
now
the
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
j
hugely
drinkable
as
most
strong
ales
are
from
stone
brewing
d
well
sadly
this
is
my
last
11th
from
stone
so
i
can
not
drink
anymore
of
this
too
bad
cause
it
tastes
good
with
some
age
on
it
overall
this
is
a
really
fantastic
beer
i
like
stone
xi
but
i
love
this
whatever
the
subtle
difference
is
its
for
the
better
definitely
something
to
stock
up
on
had
this
at
a
recent
tasting
poured
into
a
taster
glass
pours
a
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
fluffy
head
smell
has
a
nice
hop
profile
tangerine
pineapple
grass
taste
is
as
good
as
the
smell
exploding
with
a
refreshing
hop
bitterness
of
grapefruit
and
tangerine
this
has
a
nice
malt
character
with
maybe
a
bit
of
smoke
in
the
finish
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
stone
on
this
one
it
really
met
my
expectations
the
pour
surprised
me
at
first
because
i
had
not
read
the
full
blurb
on
the
back
of
the
silk
screened
label
and
was
expecting
an
ipa
but
the
last
line
gave
the
clue
to
what
this
looked
like
dark
pitch
dark
when
held
up
against
the
light
some
ruby
highlights
showed
up
but
otherwise
this
was
pretty
much
a
black
beer
in
terms
of
look
the
head
atop
seemed
small
but
stable
and
was
quite
light
in
color
which
was
in
stark
contrast
to
the
body
the
smell
was
like
a
hop
field
which
pine
and
grapefruit
smells
being
quite
prominent
underneath
them
there
was
some
chocolate
lurking
there
the
taste
was
quite
hoppy
indeed
which
made
me
wonder
if
this
was
not
a
year
old
bottle
but
rather
a
fresh
brewed
batch
for
us
on
the
east
coast
the
spicy
prickly
earthy
hoppyness
was
just
as
intense
as
any
ipa
however
the
black
patent
malt
astringency
and
some
chocolate
flavor
were
unusual
but
went
surprisingly
well
with
that
the
body
was
more
in
line
with
ipa
than
the
looks
suggested
and
this
was
very
drinkable
for
me
since
i
like
hoppy
beers
quite
a
unique
combination
but
it
works
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
while
it
is
definitely
a
sipper
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
combination
of
flavors
for
almost
9
abv
it
goes
down
easy
i
will
probably
enjoy
one
of
these
again
and
i
think
it
would
make
a
great
winter
brew
overall
an
excellent
brew
like
every
other
stone
brew
ive
had
ruination
calibelgie
ab
and
oaked
ab
still
if
arrogant
bastard
is
too
much
for
you
youre
going
to
want
to
avoid
this
even
more
arrogant
brew
was
kinda
of
upset
with
this
beer
not
going
to
repurchase
d
super
easy
to
drink
i
really
like
this
one
probably
one
of
my
favorite
stones
brews
i
compared
this
one
to
southern
tiers
iniquity
and
this
one
blows
it
out
of
the
water
this
is
drinkable
but
it
is
also
powerful
d
a
bit
off
putting
at
first
and
then
i
remind
myself
im
drinking
a
fresh
west
coast
strong
so
the
hops
dont
bother
me
as
much
now
perhaps
some
short
term
aging
would
do
this
some
good
as
it
is
a
bit
strong
for
me
at
the
moment
i
could
not
finish
a
bomber
now
but
down
the
line
when
things
have
shifted
hell
ya
drinkability
similar
to
the
bastard
for
sure
but
drinks
slower
due
to
the
abv
although
it
feels
closer
to
a
7
when
drinking
it
catches
up
as
you
go
along
good
for
a
bomber
but
not
a
whole
lot
more
for
a
session
just
a
little
too
filling
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
this
thing
was
so
earthy
it
was
like
tasting
smelling
tree
sap
it
was
something
i
hadnt
experienced
before
thats
for
sure
this
thing
could
be
mistaken
for
a
winter
ale
i
know
i
would
enjoy
a
bomber
of
this
properly
poured
into
a
chalice
on
a
snowy
day
sitting
in
front
of
a
fire
ah
i
really
did
enjoy
all
the
flavors
aromas
and
although
im
not
big
on
super
hop
giants
this
one
was
uniquely
herbal
earthy
and
i
would
love
to
have
this
again
i
recommend
you
grab
it
when
they
can
brew
it
cheers
i
got
to
admit
i
find
stones
brews
kinda
overrated
their
quality
is
not
as
high
as
a
lot
of
micro
brews
i
have
had
lately
but
this
is
one
of
their
better
beers
nice
hoppy
flavor
that
isnt
overpowering
with
a
pretty
big
body
i
personally
prefer
iniquity
to
this
but
this
still
gets
a
pretty
high
recommendation
good
but
not
great
stone
just
never
disappoints
do
they
a
black
ipa
huh
looks
great
has
an
edge
of
ruby
to
it
smells
like
hops
and
sweetness
not
so
much
burnt
as
a
stout
or
porter
usually
is
it
tastes
of
resiny
hops
and
dark
beer
flavors
in
fact
almost
black
lagerlike
in
taste
not
so
much
guinnessy
great
mouthfeel
and
although
hard
to
drink
because
of
its
heave
a
great
beer
totally
selfrighteous
d
alcohol
flavor
is
minimal
and
the
flavor
is
solid
a
well
done
brew
by
the
folks
at
stone
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
is
a
beer
id
consider
having
again
sometime
the
first
sip
brings
lots
of
hops
followed
by
a
sublte
caramel
blending
really
nicely
definately
some
grapefruit
earthy
and
pine
notes
very
pleasant
it
tends
a
bit
more
to
the
hoppy
side
but
overall
there
is
a
good
balance
very
easy
to
drink
could
probably
have
a
few
more
d
couldnt
drink
it
all
day
but
i
sure
could
come
close
im
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
this
one
another
excellent
brew
from
the
fine
folks
at
stone
over
all
pretty
good
black
ipa
had
on
tap
as
well
at
a
dfh
vs
stone
tasting
the
hop
bitterness
has
held
up
quite
well
and
imparts
a
nice
citrus
feel
with
a
roasted
finish
superbly
drinkable
d
not
something
that
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
drinkability
this
is
a
big
beer
but
it
drinks
very
smoothly
goes
down
easy
extremely
interesting
beer
and
definitely
worth
it
complex
yet
extremely
well
executed
future
outlook
wow
pretty
pricey
9
22
oz
but
i
have
to
admit
it
knocked
my
socks
off
a
superhopped
strong
ale
black
dipa
to
be
sure
and
it
worked
extremely
enjoyable
and
something
i
wont
hesitate
to
try
again
i
just
wish
it
were
cheaper
pours
a
deep
deep
brown
color
almost
black
nice
fluffy
light
brown
head
that
settles
into
a
puffy
cap
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
hops
some
pineapple
juicy
and
fresh
the
taste
is
of
grapefruit
piney
and
resiny
hops
all
in
that
order
a
roasted
malt
is
detected
after
the
hop
blast
also
a
touch
of
caramel
this
is
one
hoppy
and
roastd
malt
bitter
bomb
well
bodied
not
quite
chewy
fizzy
carbonation
bitter
all
around
finishes
with
an
asprin
like
dryness
good
contrast
between
the
hops
and
malt
but
both
bitter
a
little
too
bitter
and
dry
for
my
liking
a
big
hoppy
bitter
brew
with
plenty
of
flavor
ill
finish
off
the
bomber
but
my
tastebuds
might
be
shot
on
tap
at
the
brass
tap
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
tan
one
finger
head
the
aroma
is
a
strong
combination
of
earthypiney
hops
and
roasted
malt
some
citrus
hints
are
dashed
in
there
too
flavor
follows
suit
in
a
big
way
a
very
complex
beer
that
changes
flavor
as
you
drink
and
it
warms
starts
off
with
a
sweet
malt
flavor
but
the
hop
bitterness
follows
it
is
really
an
odd
combination
that
in
the
end
i
really
enjoy
the
hops
could
be
considered
out
of
place
but
it
works
almost
like
a
chocolate
orange
at
christmas
time
a
bit
dense
as
a
result
of
it
being
such
a
robust
beer
an
enjoyable
beer
due
to
all
the
things
happening
but
definitely
a
sipper
almost
on
that
could
stand
alone
after
dinner
as
a
treat
d
try
to
take
it
from
me
i
dare
you
a
really
interesting
beer
but
id
have
a
hard
time
drinking
a
lot
of
this
wow
great
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
great
hops
in
this
one
color
is
lightly
black
with
some
faint
red
hues
when
held
up
to
the
light
head
is
a
thick
light
beige
color
that
is
solid
good
belgian
lacing
aroma
of
earthy
piney
hops
with
some
malt
sweetness
evident
flavor
was
similar
to
how
it
smelled
rich
malt
flavors
up
front
followed
by
piney
hoppy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
good
a
big
beer
that
is
worthy
of
its
name
tastes
like
superhopped
ipa
relatively
thin
body
theres
a
mild
level
of
roasted
malt
in
the
aftertaste
otherwise
it
is
all
bitter
bitter
hop
d
drinkability
is
better
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
but
the
big
alcohol
taste
makes
me
only
want
to
stay
at
one
of
these
bad
boys
overall
a
nice
brew
and
definitely
enjoyed
the
hops
fairly
tame
next
to
some
of
stones
other
offerings
but
worth
a
look
pours
a
deep
dark
rich
black
with
a
brown
head
that
sticks
around
minimally
throughout
good
lacing
as
well
smell
is
a
beautiful
mixture
of
roasty
malts
and
sticky
piny
hopsthis
is
a
combination
that
i
havent
come
across
yet
and
its
a
welcome
frontier
tastes
congruent
with
smell
most
flavors
are
from
the
hopsbitter
citrusy
a
commanding
grapefruit
characterbut
there
are
roasty
chocolatey
flavors
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
not
creamy
drinkability
is
great
notes
this
is
like
levitation
on
steroids
to
me
with
a
higher
hop
profile
and
just
a
bigger
beer
altogether
hop
lovers
everywhere
should
seek
this
one
out
bomber
poured
into
dfh
tulip
glass
surprising
smell
of
hops
right
off
the
bat
wish
i
could
smell
the
full
effect
dam
allergies
i
was
not
expecting
the
hoppy
smell
bc
of
the
darkness
of
the
beer
very
dark
with
a
1
finger
brownish
head
looks
like
a
porter
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
silky
texture
tastes
of
hop
oak
roasted
malt
and
dare
i
say
coffeish
at
times
i
didnt
really
notice
the
8
abv
i
put
the
bomber
down
no
problem
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
its
one
of
the
best
stone
brews
i
have
had
to
date
the
picture
on
the
bottle
is
bad
ass
as
well
luckily
this
finally
arrived
my
area
so
i
plan
to
buy
some
more
cheers
d
this
is
just
a
great
brew
that
has
me
interested
im
looking
for
more
flavors
all
the
time
its
definitely
a
dark
ipastyle
brew
and
one
im
happy
i
got
my
hands
on
reminds
me
of
a
more
affordable
black
sun
stout
although
it
is
more
of
an
ipa
than
the
bss
great
stuff
here
probably
my
favorite
stone
brew
overall
the
name
as
well
as
the
label
say
it
all
this
one
is
quite
sublime
and
worthy
of
the
selfrighteous
arrogance
that
the
brewers
bestow
on
it
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
really
love
what
theyve
done
with
the
balancing
of
the
aggressive
hop
presence
and
dark
malt
backbone
i
had
3
pints
and
could
have
had
3
more
easily
exceptional
flavor
drinkability
so
damn
unique
drinkability
was
decent
strong
in
the
abv
so
i
couldnt
drink
much
but
really
enjoyed
this
one
almost
a
cross
between
hop
rod
rye
and
double
bastard
as
usual
stone
is
awesome
d
very
drinkable
i
wasnt
expecting
all
the
hops
even
though
ive
had
the
11th
anniversary
ale
which
was
a
while
back
though
jonathan
passow
d
wow
this
is
my
new
favorite
style
what
is
it
an
ipa
stout
strong
ale
a
mixture
of
everything
stone
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
as
far
as
drinkability
wouldnt
be
able
to
have
too
many
in
one
sitting
but
is
definitely
delicious
drinkability
not
too
bad
here
i
give
it
a
4
a
bigger
beer
for
sure
and
something
to
sip
on
as
its
a
little
heavy
but
it
tastes
wonderful
and
has
great
balance
drinkability
medium
the
taste
is
really
nice
and
complex
with
a
good
feel
and
the
alcohol
isnt
so
overwhelming
to
warrant
low
drinkability
overall
outstanding
offering
from
the
beer
gods
at
stone
brewing
this
is
a
limited
edition
ale
so
go
get
some
before
they
disappear
go
now
this
is
a
pretty
unique
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
ipa
style
hop
flavour
meets
porterstout
characteristics
its
a
big
beer
in
ever
sense
of
the
word
i
will
buy
this
again
d
fantastic
and
flavorful
yet
quite
drinkable
a
nice
new
bottled
offering
from
stone
nice
beer
thanks
to
cdviking
for
the
trade
perhaps
it
needs
age
for
the
drinkability
suffers
a
little
right
now
poured
into
a
pint
glass
dark
coffee
in
color
with
creamy
light
tan
head
the
faint
smell
of
coffee
very
strong
taste
im
glad
ive
only
got
one
22oz
of
these
im
not
eve
half
done
with
it
and
i
can
already
feel
it
after
taste
has
a
slight
twinge
to
the
tongue
hard
to
describe
a
very
good
beer
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
for
some
reason
the
term
porter
on
steroids
came
to
mind
while
sipping
this
beer
a
complex
and
pleasing
brew
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
served
best
in
chilly
to
cold
weather
nevertheless
a
tasty
and
fun
beer
d
very
well
put
together
beer
more
drinkable
than
either
bastards
and
more
complexity
than
other
of
those
beers
put
together
basically
sublimely
selfrighteous
is
like
one
huge
industrialsized
sheet
of
bounce
flapping
in
the
wind
one
end
of
the
clothesline
hung
on
a
pine
tree
and
the
other
on
a
lemon
tree
with
a
burning
rye
field
nearby
and
a
chocolate
factory
across
the
street
hung
by
you
as
you
munch
on
black
licorice
nibs
this
is
my
kind
of
beer
and
i
hope
they
have
the
good
sense
at
stone
to
offer
it
year
round
moldbreaking
even
having
a
transcendental
element
in
its
uniqueness
but
seriously
quaffable
which
is
really
what
counts
most
saw
a
bottle
of
this
at
the
newlyestablished
hop
city
in
atlanta
and
snatched
it
up
immediately
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
modest
head
and
lacing
on
the
glass
looks
almost
like
a
stout
smell
is
alcohol
hops
spices
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
dark
fruit
taste
is
very
complex
dark
fruit
slightly
bitter
spices
relatively
smokey
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
with
this
one
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
i
can
easily
drink
this
22
bomber
on
my
own
another
fanastic
offering
from
stone
nicely
drinkable
and
an
interesting
brew
drinkability
is
extremely
dangerously
icantsayitstronglyenough
superlatively
wonderful
between
a
very
very
mild
alcohol
presence
and
a
flavor
which
nearly
matches
what
my
current
fantasy
beer
would
taste
like
it
is
most
perilously
marvelously
drinkable
now
time
to
go
drink
the
other
half
of
the
bottle
d
this
poured
a
nearly
opaque
ruby
with
tan
head
it
smelled
like
pine
and
copper
hops
and
honey
malt
with
some
roasted
barley
and
a
bit
of
lavender
it
tasted
like
pine
and
floral
and
copper
hops
with
lots
of
roasted
barley
and
some
bitter
coffee
it
was
slightly
thick
with
mild
carbonation
and
a
lasting
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
unique
beer
i
love
the
concept
and
execution
this
is
what
a
black
and
tan
or
porter
should
be
it
was
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
with
great
taste
and
pretty
good
body
it
hid
the
alcohol
very
well
and
was
fantastically
well
constructed
quite
original
and
enjoyable
d
i
really
love
how
this
seems
to
walk
this
blurred
line
between
a
strong
ale
and
a
double
ipa
probably
worth
cellaring
a
few
as
well
and
at
6
99
it
is
worth
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
so
far
in
my
personal
experience
that
goes
without
saying
with
stone
d
was
going
to
just
drink
half
and
then
recap
it
but
i
decided
i
wanted
to
keep
exploring
this
beer
esp
when
it
warmed
a
good
sipping
beer
but
one
you
just
cant
stop
sipping
stone
owns
the
american
strong
ale
category
i
bought
this
beer
simply
because
it
said
stone
on
it
and
i
am
not
only
please
i
did
but
i
will
be
buying
it
again
more
complex
and
pronounced
than
other
examples
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
quite
the
conundrum
a
dark
ipa
thats
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
is
a
great
beer
both
fresh
as
sublimely
selfrighteous
and
with
age
on
it
as
stone
11th
in
fact
i
think
i
prefer
this
11th
time
to
throw
some
ssr
in
the
cellar
the
flavor
is
punishingly
hoppy
with
a
lot
of
roasted
notes
as
well
mouthfeel
is
smooth
not
terribly
full
more
like
a
double
ipa
than
a
stout
great
mix
of
notes
and
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
tap
very
satisfying
highly
drinkable
and
has
a
lot
of
variance
that
keeps
you
mind
and
mouth
guessing
drinkability
is
outstanding
could
go
bottle
for
bottle
of
this
d
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
the
sweet
grapefruit
theme
dominates
everything
and
creates
a
rather
onedimensional
experience
im
a
big
fan
of
stone
but
i
have
to
say
that
im
disheartened
by
this
release
its
a
decent
beer
nonetheless
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
its
just
that
in
my
mind
stone
has
done
better
work
than
this
oelergud
this
is
a
ballstothewall
stone
beer
i
guess
i
should
expect
nothing
else
from
them
but
yeah
this
one
is
particularly
asskicking
i
was
almost
confused
at
first
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
nearly
opaque
brown
color
yet
with
a
big
fluffy
head
but
at
a
whiff
it
smells
much
like
a
sappy
pineriddled
ipa
lots
of
hops
in
the
nose
but
digging
deeper
youll
find
a
nice
mellow
chocolate
character
the
taste
too
is
all
hops
up
front
really
brashly
bitter
yes
please
resin
and
pine
once
your
palate
has
been
smacked
around
by
the
pine
and
resiny
hop
attitude
you
notice
the
whole
roasty
chocolatey
rich
underbelly
of
this
beer
real
dry
and
puckering
on
the
palate
but
with
a
rich
creamy
finish
a
little
bit
of
heat
perhaps
so
much
going
on
in
this
beer
quite
a
hybrid
of
styles
wicked
good
d
heavier
than
an
ipa
in
body
and
comparable
to
a
stout
or
porter
in
color
this
ale
might
seem
like
a
challenge
by
looking
at
it
but
it
has
a
crisp
refreshing
carbonation
that
rounds
it
out
and
makes
it
extremely
drinkable
try
with
a
heavy
meal
of
grilled
steak
or
pork
or
on
its
own
for
jebus
sake
this
beer
is
absolutely
worthy
of
the
stone
catalog
another
great
release
from
stone
this
brewery
just
doesnt
stop
coming
with
the
heat
another
winner
from
stone
one
of
these
nights
ill
have
to
see
what
it
tastes
like
with
a
couple
years
on
it
d
pretty
drinkable
altough
i
dont
see
myself
enjoying
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
d
very
good
drinkability
little
alcohol
comes
through
im
beginning
to
prefer
hoppy
beers
with
a
little
bit
less
bite
than
stone
provides
but
beers
like
this
will
bring
me
back
around
to
the
stone
kickyouintheface
hop
style
black
body
visible
irregular
lace
great
retention
unholy
melange
of
coffee
and
pineapple
in
the
nose
pungent
west
coast
hops
somehow
this
works
sweet
and
luscious
grapefruit
very
earthy
underneath
with
dark
malt
taking
a
backseat
and
some
nice
multidimensional
hop
character
rich
and
almost
syrupy
dipa
body
with
hybrid
flavors
that
confound
and
entertain
the
palate
awesome
d
very
drinkable
love
this
as
much
from
the
bottle
as
i
did
from
the
tap
tasty
but
overall
low
drinkability
due
to
the
bitterness
of
the
beer
an
experince
i
would
share
with
a
friend
again
however
drinkability
is
decent
i
have
sipped
this
one
slowly
like
a
barleywine
but
it
is
still
very
very
smooth
enjoy
with
aged
cheese
if
you
still
have
one
edit
this
is
a
merged
review
from
an
aged
bottle
of
stone
11th
anniversary
d
a
nice
sipper
i
would
have
liked
to
try
this
fresh
but
it
has
held
on
fairly
well
verdict
im
totally
having
a
love
affair
with
this
beer
d
can
drink
this
all
night
stone
only
pours
an
8oz
glass
4
and
i
quickly
drained
it
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
my
duvel
tulip
looks
nice
its
pretty
dark
if
not
black
but
i
see
some
light
coming
through
the
edges
the
head
is
pretty
pillowy
some
light
tan
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
the
nose
made
me
say
wow
right
away
not
so
much
a
this
is
great
wow
but
a
this
is
interesting
wow
theres
pine
and
citrus
and
orange
some
fruity
sweetness
and
then
comes
in
the
roastiness
at
the
end
with
coffee
tones
and
light
caramel
malt
when
i
taste
it
i
can
tell
that
its
not
fresh
which
i
wasnt
expecting
of
course
but
it
still
is
pretty
hoppy
its
a
bit
sweet
prickly
with
some
grassiness
then
comes
in
the
roasty
chocolate
character
its
quite
interesting
im
not
sure
if
im
really
into
it
but
it
sure
is
fun
to
try
pretty
good
overall
quite
unique
i
was
thinking
that
id
pick
up
a
sublimely
self
righteous
if
i
come
across
one
since
im
really
curious
to
try
this
one
fresh
very
impressive
and
i
was
very
happy
to
hear
it
will
come
now
as
a
regular
unsure
if
it
is
better
fresh
as
some
mentioned
but
cannot
compare
as
i
did
not
have
it
as
it
stands
now
it
is
an
amazing
beer
i
will
probably
age
it
again
when
i
get
my
hands
on
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
had
the
11th
when
it
first
came
out
and
i
loved
it
i
love
how
this
beer
does
not
taste
like
you
would
think
based
on
its
black
color
serving
type
bomber
drinkability
this
is
so
damn
hoppy
that
it
takes
a
while
to
put
one
down
compared
to
the
only
other
black
ipa
ive
had
so
far
warrior
black
ipa
by
pizza
port
this
is
like
a
double
ipa
versus
a
regular
ipa
but
not
in
necessarily
a
good
way
i
think
when
experimenting
with
this
new
style
of
sorts
a
tasty
imperial

to
be

wait
a
second
this
is
dark
really
dark
unlike
like
any
ipa
ive
seen
before
but
totally
intriguing
from
the
get
go
totally
sturdy
head
with
lots
of
lacing
and
plenty
of
sticking
to
sides
goodness
roasted
malt
mixed
with
pine
and
citrus
is
the
complex
aroma
really
nice
and
different
taste
is
a
cross
between
a
really
nice
dark
ale
and
a
hoppy
ipa
sweet
and
malty
but
finishes
bitter
and
citrusy
excellent
stuff
sturdy
full
mouthfeel
and
this
is
one
easy
to
drink
brew
i
could
have
another
bottle
right
now
but
alas
i
only
bought
one
highest
recommendation
d
drinking
real
nice
with
a
year
under
its
belt
drinkability
this
is
indeed
a
dark
ipa
almost
a
barleywine
at
this
point
given
the
malt
content
and
the
age
on
it
definitely
an
india
black
ale
alcohol
on
this
one
is
expertlyhidden
and
not
too
outrageous
to
begin
with
so
good
show
here
recommended
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
this
has
been
in
the
cellar
for
a
year
was
going
to
review
it
election
night
instead
it
gets
its
turn
tonight
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
and
very
good
lacing
wow
big
hop
aroma
still
very
surprising
considering
its
been
in
my
cellar
for
almost
a
year
some
chocolate
as
well
nice
flavor
big
hop
bite
still
in
this
one
this
one
is
aging
very
nicely
d
could
definately
do
a
couple
more
of
these
i
would
definately
order
this
one
again
as
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
have
had
redently
overall
this
was
one
hell
of
an
interesting
strong
ale
very
freshly
hopped
and
another
great
offering
by
stone
d
if
i
remembered
this
beer
as
good
as
i
have
just
experienced
i
would
have
been
reaching
for
it
much
more
often
in
the
past
year
alcohol
isnt
overbearing
familiar
while
also
intriguing
and
still
leaves
you
wanting
more
ill
finish
my
glass
and
remember
how
great
the
stone
11th
anniversary
party
was
pours
a

with
a

this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
just
wish
i
had
gotten
more
when
it
first
came
out
d
this
was
tasty
and
good
but
it
was
quite
a
heavy
beer
and
a
bit
much
to
drink
full
in
body
with
silky
smoothness
stones
11th

is
a
fine
and
quaffable
brew
drinkability
my
how
this
has
progressed
in
just
a
years
time
i
dare
say
i
like
it
much
better
this
way
i
enjoyed
this
a
somewhat
creative
blend

crisp

also
smooth
and
roasty
even
after
having
bottles
for
over
a

this
stuff
doesnt
fail
to
impress
starting
to
taste
a
little
more
boozy
than
its

suggests
but
still
pretty
impressive
for
sitting
over
a
year
i
really
dug
this
unique

that

an

definitely
a

sipper
as
a
side
note
in
comparison
from
the
11th
anniversary
to
the
12th
it
was
really
interesting
to
see
the
difference
a

makes
one
year
overload
with
hops
but
slightly
limit
it
as

i
love
this
beer
and
am
extremely
sad
that
its
a
retired
and
b
i
found
it
almost
a
year
after
its
release
so
much
going
on
here
its
almost
as
if
it
starts
and
ipa
then
moves
to
a
stout
then
back
to
and
ipa
never
had
something
quite
like
this
i
would
highly
recommend
this
and

know

that
has

some

a

a

with

nice
balanced
beer
here
i
think
i
would
actually
prefer
this
with
age
as
one
thing
ive
noticed
with
all
stone
beers
is
that
they
all
seem
to
blend
into
each
other
when
young
not
sure
if
they
only
use
one
predominant
hop
or
malt
in
everything
or
what
burnt
malts
and
blackerry
flavors
are
than
overwhelmed
with
citrusy
hops
on
the
middle
and
chalky
bitter
finish
some
alcohol
shows
through
in
the
mouth
and
throat
but
evens
out
in
the
chest
one
of
the
better
stone
beers
ive
had
of
late
and
nearly
on
par
with
stones
10th
this
one
had
wonderful
ageability
even
with
the
demise
of
the
hops
mcallisterfeb
13
and
molasses
pours
very
dark
brown
this
brew
is
going
to
age
very
well
dont
let
the
naysayer
change
your
mind
it
may
go
through
a
significant
muddy
period
like
the
8th
but
ultimately
the
11th
will
be
fantastic
i
will
not
drink
another
for
probably
6
months
ooh
my
i
have
another
glass
cheers
galt
i
have
had
several
bottles
of
this
beer
it
is
definitely
changing
with
age
and
is
getting
mellower
when
first
released
the
beer
was
very
raw
with
hops
overdominating
and
destroying
the
beer
is
mellowing
nicely
and
the
roasted
malt
qualities
are
starting
to
poke
through
definitely
still
a
hop
bomb
i
am
interested
to
see
where
this
beer
will
go
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
beer
bitterness
was
balanced
enough
to
enjoy
it
full
flavored
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
highly
recommended
very
drinkable
im
enjoying
this
one
this
beer
looks
great
and
tastes
great
not
used
to
the
brownesqe
ale
from
this
brewery
but
enjoyed
just
the
same
this
is
a
great
beer
i
will
be
buying
more
stone
should
consider
moving
this
into
regular
production
i
would
drink
tis
again
and
again
fantastic
brew
and
i
cant
wait
till
next
years
offering
cheers
d
i
just
opened
a
bomber
so
we
will
see
if
i
get
through
that
i
think
that
i
would
drink
this
again
i
am
not
a
huge
hopbomb
fan
so
it
isnt
my
favorite
though
very
odd
that
it
is
so
dark
you
dont
get
many
dark
malt
notes
in
this
seems
like
the
color
doesnt
influence
the
taste
at
all
d
very
good
drinkability
for
its
abv
could
easily
drink
in
multiples
very
smooth
palate
going
down
and
nicely
hidden
alcohol
d
very
hoppy
yet
the
intense
malt
backbone
compliments
it
very
well
a
very
unique
ipa
that
is
a
sipper
but
quite
delicious
had
to
save
some
of
mine
for
the
next
night
this
beer
is
big
in
every
way
malty
hoppy
high
abv
although
called
an
ipa
on
the
bottle
label
ba
lists
it
as
an
american
strong
ale
i
really
appreciate
beer
like
this
that
are
hard
to
put
in
a
single
catergory
to
me
seems
to
have
the
strong
hops
prescence
and
mouthfeel
of
an
ipa
with
the
dark
carmel
malts
of
a
porter
or
stout
i
enjoyed
getting
a
hop
fix
from
a
dark
beer
great
brew
more
then
just
a
gimmick
deep
ruddy
brown
somewhat
muddy
in
appearance
floral
and
fruity
aroma
sort
of
burnt
smelling
quite
bitter
up
front
against
a
mellow
malt
flavor
very
grainy
tasting
long
lingering
bite
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
decent
enough
beer
but
i
am
not
sure
what
its
trying
to
be
i
would
like
to
see
stone
do
something
with
a
little
less
hops
in
it
i
mean
i
am
worthy
and
all
but
its
time
for
a
change
in
spots
pours
very
dark
with
smells
of
alcohol
and
malt
thick
tan
head
with
good
retention
taste
is
mostly
malty
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
alcohol
smell
doesnt
really
come
through
in
the
taste
overall
the
taste
didnt
match
what
i
expected
from
a
dark
ipa
what
the
heck
is
an
ipa
doing
this
dark
anyway
i
prefer
more
hop
and
less
malt
but
overall
i
like
this
beer
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
beer
from
stone
that
i
didnt
like
served
in
a
generic
pint
glass
pours
a
dark
almost
black
body
with
a
big
frothy
tan
head
hoppy
aroma
taste
is
impressive
big
powerful
hit
of
hops
but
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
maltiness
that
is
balanced
very
well
this
beer
reminded
me
of
a
dipa
and
an
imperial
stout
that
got
together
to
make
something
new
the
alcohol
is
present
but
pleasantly
welcome
goes
down
quite
nicely
another
great
offering
from
a
brewery
i
wish
would
come
to
connecticut
some
day
kudos
to
stone
for
being
creative
and
taking
a
chance
this
is
a
finely
crafted
gem
to
commemorate
their
eleventh
anniversary
admittedly
i
am
a
sucker
for
over
the
top
citrus
hop
taste
and
bitterness
and
this
beer
satisfied
that
immensely
but
unlike
most
super
hopped
up
beers
this
one
added
considerable
nuances
from
the
malt
as
well
not
only
did
i
think
it
cool
to
have
an
almost
black
ipa
or
is
it
a
ida
or
iba
but
the
malts
added
a
lot
to
the
overall
character
of
this
brew
in
all
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
has
ever
passed
through
these
lips
my
wish
is
that
stone
will
bring
this
one
back
in
the
future
but
for
now
enjoy
it
while
you
still
can
for
drinkability
all
i
can
say
is
yes
more
please
as
far
as
strong
ales
go
i
probably
would
enjoy
this
more
than
arrogant
bastard
is
that
blasphemous
to
say
a
fitting
tribute
to
a
lucky
number
11
years
and
going
strong
from
a
1pint
6
fl
oz
bottle
copped
from
home
liquors
in
verona
this
magnificent
brew
pours
a
jetblack
ebony
color
with
a
tan
frothy
head
looks
and
smells
similar
to
a
stout
or
porter
although
the
bottle
claims
this
is
an
ale
big
bottle
with
a
picture
of
a
winged
devil
lifting
a
beer
mug
behind
a

with

on

paid

this

with

rich
creamy
thick

taste
is
strong
with
a
chocolate
velvet
dark
coffee
flavor
with
strong
cocoa
notes
good
mouthfeel
and
for
an
8
7
abv
you
dont
really
notice
the
alcohol
so
much
as
the
unique
combination
of
flavors
a
definite
winner
from
stone
one
of
the
better
brews
from
the
company
that
ive
sampled
definitely
recommended
overall
full
bodied
with
strong
bitterness
yet
fully
balanced
as
an
ipa
good
strong
carbonation
just
enough
to
savor
for
a
long
time
and
keep
the
beer
moving
just
awesome
this
is
the
third
time
ive
had
one
of
these
and
felt
it
was
ready
for
my
review
but
there
is
even
more
in
here
i
like
this
beer
even
more
because
without
knowing
that
stone
was
creating
theirs
i
made
my
own
dark
double
ipa
at
exactly
the
same
time
i
guess
since
my
mind
was
on
the
style
it
made
me
appreciate
the
effort
more
its
great
think
about
it
outstanding
beer
in
my
opinion
definitely
a
unique
offering
and
i
wish
it
was
more
readily
available
im
glad
i
was
able
to
grab
a
case
because
this
has
become
one
of
my
more
favorite
beers
d
like
i
said
earlier
this
is
pretty
good
but
aside
from
the
novelty
of
a
black
hoppy
beer
im
not
sure
what
the
fuss
is
about
d
a
very
good
beer
shame
it
is
not
offer
regularly
and
shame
it
was
not
available
in
de
when
it
came
out
luckily
i
got
mine
at
the
source
another
enjoyable
beer
experience
from
stone
ballsy
concept
with
good
follow
through
i
like
it
but
not
love
it
overall
im
blown
away
but
this
brew
is
really
in
a
category
all
its
own
putting
it
into
the
american
strong
ale
category
is
stupid
its
a
very
unique
brew
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
looking
for
an
intense
experience
allaround
very
intense
beer
that
i
will
be
getting
again
recommended
still
a
very
tasty
beer
was
a
touch
better
really
fresh
but
still
quite
solid
i
thought
i
missed
out
on
this
one
but
was
delighted
to
find
them
in
abundance
at
my
local
liquor
store
one
day
poured
this
from
a
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
looks
pretty
much
like
a
good
porter
or
stout
should
black
with
at
least
a
twofinger
head
that
retained
itself
very
well
edges
are
ruby
red
when
held
up
to
light
lacing
sticks
on
the
glass
all
the
way
down
huge
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
however
there
is
a
solid
dark
malt
presence
pretty
complex
taste
is
very
hoppy
of
course
however
there
is
a
solid
malt
backbone
that
makes
this
fairly
balanced
considering
the
huge
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thick
almost
syrupy
actually
creamy
is
the
word
that
comes
to
mind
carbonation
is
moderately
high
alcohol
is
a
bit
on
the
high
side
but
still
drinkable
especially
if
you
give
this
beer
the
time
and
respect
it
deserves
pours
a
deep
black
with
the
slightest
ruby
where
light
penetrates
nice
off
whitelight
tan
head
the
smell
is
of
an
ipa
with
a
little
bit
of
that
oaked
bastard
smell
maltfunk
and
some
light
spicy
cream
the
taste
is
a
two
headed
beast
it
starts
off
making
you
think
it
is
going
to
be
a
strong
ipa
the
taste
then
mellows
into
that
creamy
kind
of
oaked
bastard
taste
the
finish
has
some
good
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
throat
but
is
smoother
than
your
average
strong
ipa
mouthfeel
is
nice
not
too
thick
not
too
thin
very
drinkable
and
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
ive
put
two
of
these
in
the
cellar
just
for
the
f
of
it
to
see
what
happens
ya
never
know
good
offering
from
stone
and
defenitely
not
what
i
expected
by
the
color
this
is
the
darkest
damn
ipa
related
sort
fo
kind
of
hoppy
thing
ive
ever
had
good
brew
tho
go
stone
dawesome
what
a
great
beer
and
huge
surpirse
i
was
thinking
a
big
porter
of
some
form
but
it
turned
out
to
be
a
awesome
ipa
certainly
would
age
well
overall
another
excellent
offering
from
stone
this
is
a
poweful
beer
dark
and
basically
black
it
pours
with
a
nice
creamy
tan
head
sort
of
a
smoky
flavor
and
sweet
aroma
at
first
the
taste
is
huge
lots
of
hops
all
over
you
can
notice
the
sweetness
in
the
ale
it
tastes
like
an
ipa
but
the
smokiness
makes
it
quite
different
and
very
enjoyable
unique
a
light
brown
color
with
touches
of
red
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
two
inch
thock
head
foems
beige
in
color
and
lacing
slowly
down
the
glass
an
incrdible
aroma
of
citrus
mostly
grapefruit
pine
and
grass
scents
with
a
earthy
mellowness
there
is
a
surprisingly
feint
scent
of
malt
at
the
end
at
first
taste
that
malt
is
very
apparent
with
a
sweet
nutty
flavor
that
flavor
is
overtaken
by
a
dominant
hop
presence
with
grapefruit
and
grassy
tastes
being
the
strongest
a
medium
bodied
feel
all
the
way
through
very
consistant
coats
the
palate
evenly
and
a
dry
finish
lingers
for
some
time
wow
what
else
is
there
to
say
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
thought
the
tenth
anniversary
brew
was
outstanding
this
beer
surpasses
that
one
d
hits
pretty
hard
at
8

with

aftertaste
of

this
is
a
misunderstood
beauty
there
are
very
few
black
ipas
on
the
market
greg
noonan
at
vermont
pub
and
brewery
used
to
brew
one
and
i
lived
for
it
this
one
takes
the
cake
though
its
appearance
is
as
exciting
as
the
taste
profile
the
dominant
hops
are
not
overpowering
so
that
the
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
come
through
i
am
not
sure
why
this
is
labeled
as
american
strong
ale
it
is
not
like
old
thumper
or
the
old
magic
hat
red
ale
its
an
ipa
on
steroids
great
beer
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
full
persistent
head
aroma
has
a
bunch
of
citrus
hoppiness
in
there
along
with
some
nice
roastiness
that
pushes
through
once
you
expect
the
hops
taste
is
all
ipa
at
first
then
a
bit
more
of
a
dry
chocolate
malt
flavor
comes
through
the
malt
sweetness
seems
to
build
as
you
drink
and
the
hop
flavor
also
becomes
more
sweet
and
less
bitter
really
an
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeel
is
solid
maybe
just
a
tad
heavy
for
the
workout
the
flavor
gives
you
drinkabiity
is
also
very
good
something
interesting
that
id
like
to
see
more
examples
of
in
the
future
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
fairly
balanced
with
respect
to
hops
and
malts
smooth
and
fullbodied
mouthfeel
makes
this
brew
a
good
session

is
a
mix
between
some
roasted
malt
with
some
westcoats
bitter
hops
mostly
dominating
body
is
quite
full
with
some
great
carbonation
and
alcohol
is
not
apparent
interesting
take
on
the
ipa
style
but
nothing
really
earth
shattering
d
the
drinkablity
is
down
because
of
the
high
alcohol
content
and
the
bitterness
but
if
you
like
ipas
this
is
a
good
one
but
not
as
good
as
ruination
pours
a
dark
black
that
shows
some
red
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
two

head
that
dissipates
but
never
goes

the

down

citrusy
piney
grapefruity
hops
with
a
faint
biscuitcaramel
malt
in
the
background
taste
is
more
of
the
same
bitter
hops
another
great
offering
from
stone
d
this
is
a
very
drinakble
brew
easily
sessionable
overall
a
pleasure
to
drink
since
there
are
really
no
rules
on
this
style
other
than
high
abv
this
is
a
good
beer
sould
have
bought
another
when
i
had
the
chance
stone
needs
to
come
to
wisconsin
i
first
tried
this
on
tap
at
the
hop
devil
in
manhattan
several
months
ago
but
finally
got
around
to
trying
a
bomber
over
the
holidays
it
pours
black
with
a
tan
colored
foam
but
smells
like
a
strong
ipa
grapefruit
citrus
dominating
the
taste
is
mainly
hops
i
dont
get
much
of
any
roasted
malt
that
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
very
good
as
stone
always
produces
good
ipas
this
was
definitely
an
interesting
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
describe
it
as
a
hopped
up
porter
or
a
dark
ipa
but
its
good
and
that
works
for
me
stone
is
definitely
going
to
have
a
hard
time
topping
this
for
their
12th
anniversary
but
i
am
definitely
looking
forward
to
it
id
say
this
beer
leans
more
towards
black
ipa
than
very
hoppy
stout
the
ipa
characteristics
take
the
front
seat
here
mmmmm
hops
a
good
original
beer
an
interesting
bridge
between
styles
as
i
drink
it
the
bitterness
becomes
a
little
more
intense
and
offbalance
but
it
still
rocks
i
do
prefer
black
rye
to
this
as
its
just
as
intense
but
a
scoche
more
balanced
but
this
is
still
damn
tasty
good
this
has
to
be
the
least
enjoyed
of
any
stone
beer
i
have
tried
d
more
d
i
could
drink
this
every
day
if
possible
i
am
really
pleased
another
ringer
by
stone
a
great
one
a
very
good
ipa
with
added
thickness
from
chocolate
malt
pours
dark
and
foamy
hoppy
ahh
the
taste
of
citrus
chop
there
is
also
amarillo
and
simcoe
and
the
chop
aroma
background
roastiness
full
mouthfeel
delightful
as
a
meal
in
itself
stone
xi
poured
a
deep
ruby
color
more
along
the
characteristics
of
a
stout
than
a
brown
ale
the
head
was
dark
rich
and
had
a
surge
similar
to
a
guinness
the
smell
had
a
noticeable
aroma
of
earthy
hops
and
a
slight
roasted
malt
undertone
the
taste
was
true
to
the
aroma
it
had
a
solid
roasted
malt
character
that
sat
well
on
the
tongue
and
faded
gently
into
a
distinct
and
enjoyable
hop
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
very
good
a
nice
body
but
not
heavy
or
thick
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
but
be
careful
to
enjoy
in
moderation
or
it
will
bite
you
back
enjoy
in
the
11th
anniversary
ale
the
hops
are
mingled
with
the
chocolatecoffee
taste
from
porter
but
not
flawlessly
so
but
it
is
a
fun
diversion
and
i
am
glad
i
came
across
this
one
wow
definitely
one
to
try
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
as
its
only
listed
as
stone
xi
and
mentions
a
dark
ipa
on
the
back
pours
a
brownishblack
color
with
ruby
accents
around
the
perimeter
the
head
is
a
little
too
over
abundant
and
hangs
around
in
thick
12
clumps
after
finishing
a
pint
as
it
warms
the
head
only
multiplies
in
following
pours
leaving
long
yearning
minutes
of
undrinkable
beer
due
to
a
mountain
of
foam
smell
is
intoxicating
a
porter
an
ipa
both
smells
of
toasted
oats
and
grain
while
balanced
by
a
hoppy
aroma
slight
citrus
note
porter
and
some
barley
wine
qualities
this
is
among
stones
better
brews
as
it
is
an
ensemble
to
the
sense
let
this
beer
sit
from
the
fridge
for
awhile
and
its
definitely
a
treat

abv
is
very
well
hidden
under
all
the
flavor
normally
id
expect
to
tell
you
that
the
alcohol
appears
as
it
warms
but
ive
been
through
several
bottles
of
this
not
all
tonight
and
im
now
certain
no
bottle
is
going
to
last
until
it
warms
great
stuff
another
great
anniversary
brew
from
stone
this
is
very
interesting
and
complex
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
the
10th
anniversary
brew
and
the
11th
is
right
up
there
with
it
poured
into
a
stone
pint
glass
a
nice
cleanclear
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
onefinger
plus
creamy
tan

which
then
leaves
some
nice
small
islands
and
thick
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
mostly
malty
very
slight
hop
tones
and
lots
of
caramel
the
taste
is
very
malty
some
hops
and
caramel
the
finish
is
dry
and
slight
bitterness
to
it
the
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
full
body
very
drinkable
another
awesome
brew
from
stone
very
much
a
joy
to
drink
highly
recommended
d
im
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
these
hoppy
dark
beers
tasty
but
they
arent
one
of
my
favorite
stylesnot
yet
at
least
regardless
this
is
a
delicious
beer
with
fantastic
balance

near
black
russett

aromas
are
of
a
hoppy
ipa
but
also
there
is
some

there
as
well
this
is
kind
of
a
cross

helps
this
beer
achieve
a
solid

level
nice

the
abundance

flavor
really
hides
the
alcohol
nicely
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
only
wish
it
was
available

in

thank
god
for

beer
stone
11th
anniversary
pours
a
deep
black
with
hints
of
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
has
a
creamy
brown
head
that
lingers
nicely
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
malty
with
loads
if
citrusy
hops
there
are
hints
of
darker
malts
but
not
as
much
as
i
would
expect
from
the
color
the
flavor
starts
with
sweet
dark
caramel
but
it
quickly
gives
way
to
bitter
citrusy
hops
if
i
wasnt
looking
at
the
color
of
this
beer
i
would
just
assume
it
was
a
big
resiny
dipa
but
if
i
look
for
them
the
roasted
malts
come
through
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
and
strength
are
both
well
hidden
probably
because
the
beer
is
just
overboard
with
flavor
d
this
beer
is
impressive
in
craftsmanship
nice
black
color
all
ipa
in
flavor
it
is
not
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
many
of
but
is
tastyit
kept
me
coming
back
this
ale
isnt
what
i
consider
complex
but
makes
its
point
well
and
is
very
drinkable
shame
it
is
only
around
for
the
anniversary
i
knew
this
was
referred
to
as
a
dark
ipa
but
from
a
distance
it
could
have
been
a
stout
with
its
dark
color
with
ruby
edges
with
a
cream
like
head
not
much
on
the
nose
a
bit
estery
with
some
roasted
smell
a
great
mouthfeel
to
this
very
smooth
with
little
to
no
carbonation
some
dark
fruit
and
black
licorice
as
well
as
some
little
maple
syrup
very
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
can
feel
the
effects
after
one
bomber
interesting
for
sure
im
not
sure
how
this
goes
as
per
american
strong
ales
but
this
seems
to
be
an
odd
duck
drinkability
im
not
sure
this
warrants
outstanding
from
me
the
10th
i
thought
was
a
lot
more
ballsy
and
out
of
this
world
though
it
was
higher
alcohol
and
more
sought
after
i
suppose
i
do
however
like
the
experiment
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
can
be
a
kind
of
strong
ale
to
set
the
standards
for
more
like
it
with
the
oddenough
and
unheardof
hybird
at
least
from
me
of
ipa
and
porter
which
this
beer
does
somehow
quite
singularly
and
successfully
certainly
beyond
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
a
bottle
and
even
if
you
wouldnt
go
for
such
a
style
this
isnt
going
to
be
around
for
long
of
course
the
beer
emerges
from
the
22ounce
bottle
a
sparkling
deep
brown
the
head
a
crown
of
light
chocolate
creamy
and
long
lasting
after
its
final
demise
the
lace
forms
a
thick
blanket
to
cover
the
glass
nose
has
a
profound
hop
floral
spiciness
at
the
front
backed
by
the
sweet
malt
caramel
and
maybe
a
hint
of
chocolate
mouth
watering
start
has
a
nice
malt
sweetness
hop
bitter
bite
to
the
back
top
is
moderately
full
in
feel
finish
has
a
determined
acidity
the
hops
potent
and
spicy
the
alcohol
warms
the
tummy
while
the
aftertaste
continues
the
hop
spiciness
drinkability
tasty
deceptive
and
great
im
sure
youve
had
this
by
now
and
if
not
try
it
not
as
great
as
some
proclaim
but
a
step
in
a
new
direction
a
bit
of
bright
orange
and
grapefruit
pith
then
a
round
of
chocolate
and
coffee
grounds
im
enjoying
that
this
is
a
very
nice
asa
and
i
rate
it
pretty
high
on
the
drinkability
scale
despite
the
high
abv
drinkablity
is
about
average
the
booze
is
certainly
there
and
im
not
to
fond
of
grapefruit
juice
even
if
it
is
as
sweet
as
this
however
like
most
stone
brews
that
second
half
of
the
bomber
goes
down
way
to
quick
still
i
couldnt
really
take
to
big
of
a
swig
that
weird
sweet
and
sour
combo
was
just
too
much
i
had
this
right
when
it
came
out
and
this
one
tastes
about
the
same
maybe
a
hair
sweeter
but
i
think
the
store
kept
it
chilled
the
past
3
months
as
the
hops
are
still
in
full
effect
im
gonna
cellar
one
just
to
see
what
happens
in
about
2
years
sure
the
hops
will
fade
but
dark
beers
really
develop
well
in
my
experience
and
i
expect
a
whole
new
animal
by
then
ive
been
drinking
the
stone
anniversary
ales
since
7th
and
havent
been
blown
away
by
any
of
them
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
in
comparison
to
imperial
russian
stout
ruination
ipa
ipa
et
al
11th
is
probably
my
favorite
and
is
a
beer
that
deserves
a
repeat
purchase
if
im
lucky
enough
to
run
across
a
few
bombers
again
dont
age
this
one
drink
it
now
review
from
notes
drank
during
the
pittbaltimore
game
a
few
weeks
ago
go
lers
stone
11th
anniversary
ale
looks
marvelous
it
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
three
finger
frothy
tawnybrown
head
hops
come
through
on
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
malt
and
almost
licorice
grapefruit
and
orange
hoppiness
dominate
with
some
bready
malt
flavors
submerged
in
the
mix
the
hops
are
aggressive
not
overly
bitter
but
would
mitigate
my
desire
to
drink
this
brew
all
night
long
drinkability
not
a
bad
drink
looks
like
a
porter
but
wasnt
would
buy
agin
cant
wait
for
12th
ann
really
i
love
this
beer
and
im
happy
finally
to
be
able
to
say
that
about
a
beer
from
stone
good
body
alcohol
seems
pretty
well
hidden
to
me
interesting
beast
this
one
is
drinkability
is
good
the
bitterness
feels
a
little
high
and
out
of
balance
but
thatll
settle
out
with
time
the
solid
malt
base
holds
it
all
together
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
fairly
well
i
can
see
this
one
coming
together
nicely
with
some
time
in
the
cellar
but
its
still
quite
good
now
d
this
is
a
dangerous
brew
since
it
is
very
drinkable
and
does
such
a
nice
job
of
masking
the
8
7
abv
i
havent
had
a
bad
stone
beer
yet
and
i
think
this
might
just
be
my
favorite
frisco
has
7
of
the
stone
beers
on
tap
right
now
in
preparation
for
a
tasting
tonight
wish
i
could
be
there
get
it
drink
it
good
drinkability
although
i
wouldnt
session
this
one
shes
got
some
bite
to
er
very
good
excellent
theres
a
lot
to
like
about
this
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
one
thing
you
can
always
count
on
from
stone
is
a
finely
crafted
and
interesting
brew
pours
deep
brown
almost
black
smells
like
a
coffee
and
some
fruit
citrus
and
piny
smells
very
aromatic
taste
is
amazingly
smooth
and
very
balanced
yet
complex
lots
of
different
flavors
exactly
like
what
you
smell
instead
of
the
high
alcohol
overwhelming
the
taste
it
warms
you
up
with
every
drink
i
love
this
stuff
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
get
some
more
before
its
gone
forever
notes
this
is
the
best
american
beer
ive
had
for
a
long
time
really
impressive
stuff
lots
of
hop
bitterness
good
malt
backbone
long
dry
finish
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
lingering
chocolate
very
drinkable
a
unique
beer
that
was
great
fun
to
drink
schwartz
ipa
this
is
an
amazing
beer
and
i
hope
i
can
find
more
of
it
too
bad
its
a
one
time
batchthis
is
my
kind
of
ipa
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
strong
ales
ive
had
to
date
i
wish
this
was
part
of
the
stone
line
up
for
the
rest
of
time
a
pretty
decent
ipa
if
i
do
say
so
a
bit
dark
on
the
color
but
still
very
nice
heavier
in
body
and
flavor
than
the
arrogant
bastard
and
lighter
in
body
and
bitterness
than
the
double
bastard
reminds
me
somewhat
of
rocket
red
obviously
it
doesnt
taste
like
that
but
the
flavor
profile
reminds
me
of
it
pretty
good
almost
9
no
wonder
i
got
toasted
off
one
bottle
22oz
you
wouldnt
know
from
drinking
it
the
aroma
is
a
surprising
pine
citrus
thick
and
juicy
moves
right
into
the
quaff
juicy
pine
bubblegum
smacks
with
citrus
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
malt
in
the
finish
this
is
one
loaded
up
brew
sips
like
a
dream
while
watching
football
and
working
on
some
cheddar
and
crackers
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
goes
down
easy
reminds
me
of
a
west
coast
dipa
mixed
with
a
good
porter
highly
recommended
another
stone
masterpiece
d
hop
heads
now
have
a
leader
in
the
dark
side
of
the
color
spectrum
a
bit
hoppy
for
me
but
a
treat
none
the
less
drinkability
was
very
good
doesnt
really
feel
like
a
big
heavy
beer
one
of
the
most
unique
beers
i
had
in
the
festival
and
most
unique
beers
up
to
this
day
the
taste
again
is
strong
of
hops
but
is
well
complemented
with
a
variety
of
dark
roasted
malts
the
bitter
hops
really
linger
well
throughout
the
finish
a
well
balanced
medium
body
and
a
creamy
mouthfeel
make
this
beer
quite
drinkable
considering
its
complexity
this
beer
is
a
beautiful
blend
between
a
powerful
ipa
and
a
classic
strong
ale
drinkability
is
quite
good
this
is
an
interesting
beer
kudos
to
stone
for
making
this
unique
beer
not
my
favorite
stone
brew
but
this
is
still
tasty
and
well
worth
a
try
d
i
want
more
but
it
is
8
7
overall
a
great
looking
beer
great
hop
flavor
without
the
bitterness
decent
drinkablity
a
black
ipa
and
a
fine
one
at
that
it
pours
as
black
as
the
ace
of
spades
with
a
nice
head
that
reduces
to
fine
lacing
that
holds
for
the
entire
beer
the
aroma
is
sweet
hops
that
strike
the
nose
the
first
sip
gives
wonderful
mouthfeel
as
the
hops
explode
in
your
mouth
the
aftertaste
was
great
leaving
you
longing
for
the
next
sip
this
was
an
exceptionally
great
beer
that
can
only
be
improved
by
year
round
production
from
now
till
the
end
of
time
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
hop
crazy
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
be
wary
d
wow
this
beer
is
pure
joy
this
brew
is
the
answer
for
us
stout
lovers
who
are
also
closet
hop
heads
i
couldnt
possibly
recommended
this
brew
enough
d
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
a
great
ipa
example
love
the
hops
love
the
beer
this
one
is
disappearing
much
too
fast
d
interesting
mix
of
ipa
hoppiness
and
stout
roasted
malts
that
packs
a
punch
not
the
best
stone
brew
ive
had
but
still
enjoyable

to

wow
stone
really
innovates
with
this
one
and
messes
with
your
head
looks
like
a
porter
and
tastes
like
a
whack
in
the
face
iipa
enjoy
this
beer
while
its
still
around
ill
be
said
to
see
it
go
d
drinkable
to
the
max
what
a
surprisingly
dark
treat
another
great
beer
from
stone
i
dont
think
these
guys
do
anything
wrong
a
black
ipa
is
a
cool
concept
that
i
hope
to
see
again
in
the
future
keep
it
up
over
there
at
stone
i
have
yet
to
not
be
crazy
about
any
of
your
brews
looks
like
root
beer
smells
like
hops
nice
fluffy
tan
colored
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
good
while
good
lacing
aroma
is
mosty
piney
and
sappy
with
nuances
of
caramel
and
suggestive
chocolate
some
leafy
suggestions
as
well
very
hoppy
with
bitterness
throughout
yet
some
malty
sweetness
comes
through
too
pretty
balanced
and
drinkable
the
roasted
malts
make
for
an
interesting
twist
on
what
would
be
typically
an
imperial
ipa
kind
of
feels
like
an
imperial
stock
ale
i
like
it
it
reminds
me
of
of
an
ale
i
brewed
10
years
ago
except
the
simcoe
hop
was
not
around
then
and
cascades
were
used
and
i
accidentally
used
a
bit
too
much
chocolate
malt
in
the
grain
bill
anyhow
stones
11th
is
an
agreeable
ale
worth
checking
out
pours
a
very
dark
almost
black
color
small
head
settled
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
chock
full
of
citrusy
hops
flavor
is
also
tilted
towards
citrus
flavors
with
hints
of
coffee
dark
chocolate
maybe
even
some
peat
somewhere
in
the
mix
initially
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
harsh
but
that
fades
very
quickly
to
a
full
boddied
brew
with
a
slightly
fizzy
finish
another
well
rounded
offering
from
stone
im
not
sure
if
this
beer
is
trying
to
be
a
dark
ipa
or
a
very
hoppy
porter
but
whichever
it
is
it
does
it
quite
well
its
a
great
looking
and
great
tasting
beer
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
dichotomy
between
the
black
body
and
strong
hop
character
all
in
all
this
is
another
great
stone
offering
happy
12th
they
have
to
start
distributing
to
nc
so
i
can
buy
their
awesome
beer
constantly
wow
what
an
interesting
beer
extremely
well
balanced
all
around
hoppy
and
bitter
but
not
too
over
the
top
excellent
and
very
well
crafted
highly
recommended
for
the
advanced
hophead
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
beer
pours
a
mostly
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
huge
pillowy
offwhite
head
tons
of
resin
and
pine
with
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
nose
a
little
bit
of
licorice
and
chocolate
is
also
there
following
the
hops
a
very
subtly
carbonated
beer
brings
forth
a
freshly
hopped
beer
rounded
out
by
lots
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
the
finish
is
quite
bitter
and
dry
with
the
hop
flavor
carrying
through
this
is
an
exquisite
beer
im
glad
to
enjoy
it
at
this
date
as
any
more
aging
would
kill
the
fresh
hop
flavor
this
style
seems
to
be
a
trend
with
averys
anniversary
beer
and
perhaps
started
by
dfh
india

i
love

notes
the
darkest
ipa
i
have
ever
seensmelled
body
is
nice
and
creamy
more
like
a
stout
than
a
strong
ale
nevertheless
it
fits
the
big
malt
profile
and
high
abv
of
this
beer
quite
well
although
it
runs
a
touch
strong
for
everyday
or
session
drinking
this
is
a
very
drinkable
ale
hail
to
the
folks
at
stone
i
look
forward
to
what
they
come
up
with
during
the
next
11
years
i
picked
up
a
couple
bottles
of
this
while
i
was
in
boston
for
work
with
first
pour
i
knew
this
was
an
entirely
different
beer
than
one
normally
gets
their
hands
on
i
recently
brewed
a
double
black
ipa
and
thought
it
was
wonderful
but
it
pales
in
comparison
to
this
this
is
undoubtedly
an
imperial
black
ipa
the
unbelievable
hop
powerhouse
aroma
unleashes
itself
immediately
massive
pine
and
grassy
overtones
explode
in
the
nose
sticking
your
head
in
a
bin
of
freshly
picked
hops
is
comparable
to
this
smell
jet
black
body
with
beige
head
lacing
was
intense
and
carbonation
was
lively
the
taste
was
all
ipa
from
beginning
to
end
wonderful
hop
presence
throughout
with
a
warming
alcohol
taste
maltiness
is
there
but
well
hidden
behind
the
hops
sharpness
is
intense
but
very
enjoyable
the
high
abv
is
hidden
behind
the
ibus
this
is
a
wonderfully
crafted
beer
that
hop
heads
need
to
try
i
would
love
to
know
how
they
managed
to
get
the
dark
body
without
the
roasted
bitterness
for
my
black
ipa
i
cold
steeped
debittered
black
malt
for
2
days
this
a
superb
beer
please
make
this
beer
again
stone
wonderful
md
carbonation
is
just
right
full
bodied
drinkability
is
fine
on
this
one
but
it
is
definately
a
sipper
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
kudos
to
stone
for
the
mouthfeel
on
this
brew
i
dont
think
that
i
could
imagine
it
any
other
way
the
beer
is
incredibly
smooth
has
low
carbonationwhich
one
doesnt
notice
until
one
thinks
on
it
then
realizes
that
it
is
the
perfect
amount
this
is
a
beer
id
drink
all
night
alcohol
is
hidden
pretty
well
slight
spiciness
as
formerly
mentioned
and
a
slight
warming
in
the
stomach
this
is
a
beer
id
definitely
buy
again
think
that
ill
grab
another
bomber
next
time
i
see
one
too
bad
it
is
a
limited
release
id
like
to
see
something
like
this
around
more
seems
to
me
that
dark
ipas
are
pretty
rare
hard
to
desrcibe
the
taste
other
than
a
dark
ipa
it
really
worked
for
me
the
piney
hops
with
some
of
the
typical
darker
flavors
chocolatecoffee
worked
very
well
the
alcohol
starts
to
creep
in
after
a
few
sips
and
warmed
me
nicely
on
a
cold
night
i
would
seek
this
out
again
and
encourage
any
beer
afficianado
to
do
the
same
a
very
big
but
drinkable
offering
from
stone
check
it
out
if
you
can
the
taste
is
superb
with
a
very
good
blend
of
hops
and
malt
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
flavors
are
apparent
and
get
stronger
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
very
very
taste
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
tasted
cola
brown
as
it
poured
from
the
bottle
the
head
was
active
and
bubbly
at
first
then
settled
to
a
thin
mousse
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
in
the
glass
the
color
was
dark
brown
with
some
deep
red
visible
against
backlighting
the
smell
is
rich
with
both
sweet
malt
and
spicey
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
fluffy
as
though
this
were
a
caskconditioned
beer
interesting
there
are
definite
darkroasted
slightly
burnt
notes
in
the
flavor
the
burnt
malt
flavor
dominates
the
hops
hops
somewhat
so
the
hops
in
the
smell
are
stronger
than
in
the
flavor
this
is
a
very
interesting
hybrid
style
i
wouldnt
want
to
to
drink
it
all
the
time
but
it
is
fun
as
a
one
time
brew
im
disappointed
in
this
offering
good
drinkability
does
a
good
job
cleaning
up
after
itself
for
a
probably
substantial
malt
bill
the
total
package
is
excellent
though
and
if
i
had
to
give
it
an
overall
score
it
would
probably
be
higher
than
how
these
ratings
add
up
expertly
crafted
if
i
had
a
vote
for
one
of
stones
one
shots
to
become
a
regular
this
would
be
it
d
overall
very
smooth
drinking
with
interesting
tastes
and
pretty
well
balanced
not
bad
but
more
complexity
would
have
been
nice
drinkablility
is
quite
low
i
choked
the
beer
down
in
fact
almost
sent
it
back
for
something
else
guess
what
stone
is
the
new
rogue
lets
throw
an
overload
of
hops
into
a
bunch
of
different
base
beers
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
opaque
with
a
thin
head
and
good
retention
aroma
has
big
hoppy
notes
mingling
with
fruit
and
the
hops
are
complex
and
aromatic
nice
flavor
has
a
chewy
fruity
malt
backbone
with
fragrant
pinetinged
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
this
one
is
like
juicyfruit
in
a
glass
another
excellent
beer
form
a
brewery
well
known
for
its
fine
hoppy
ales

the
mouth
is
medium
thick
with
a
biting
carbonation
and
a
slight
alcohol
burn
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
liked
this
beer
its
a
complete
surprise
to
have
such
a
hoppy
beer
after
it
pours
more
like
a
stout
stone
was
trying
to
mix
things
up
a
bit
here
and
its
a
nice
change
i
think
this
will
really
be
something
in
a
years
time
recommended
good
old
stone
razing
my
taste
buds
as
usual

hope
you
have
at
least
11
more
anniversaries
stone
you
guys
are
incredible
i
just
wish
they
offered
your
entire
lineup
in
texas
i
just
have
to
second
many
of
the
thoughts
of
those
that
enjoyed
this
beer
though
i
read
the
reviews
before
drinking
i
already
had
purchased
two
bottles
i
was
quite
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
it
they
experimented
with
this
beer
and
really
hit
the
mark
in
my
estimation
simply
i
just
wanted
to
give
further
props
to
a
beer
that
is
not
only
interesting
but
pretty
damn
good
to
drink
as
well
dont
let
my
confusion
steer
you
away
from
giving
this
a
try
im
not
saying
its
bad
in
fact
im
saying
its
amazing
its
easily
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
ever
sampled
one
thats
challenging
on
every
level
if
you
can
still
find
a
bottle
you
owe
it
to
yourself
to
give
it
a
shot
d
such
and
unusual
style
and
color
nice
beer
i
will
be
getting
a
few
more
the
8
7
alcohol
is
well
masked
just
another
great
beer
from
stone
bitterness
rides
the
flavor
all
the
way
through
smokey
woody
bitter
coffee
chocolate
and
a
somewhat
pronounced
smoked
jerky
flavor
hop
profile
is
earthy
green
grassy
and
citric
alcohol
warmth
is
there
but
subdued
unique
flavors
they
mesh
well
ive
missed
the
other
10
anniversary
ales
as
i
am
only
2
years
into
my
beer
exploration
journey
i
have
come
to
love
stones
offerings
and
was
excited
when
i
saw
this
one
at
the
store
an
absolute
opaque
black
in
appearance
with
a
nice
light
tan
head
lots
of
intense
pungent
hops
in
the
smell
smells
like
a
stone
beer
it
just
has
that
smell
that
the
stone
beers
have
wow
lots
of
sticky
piney
hops
in
the
taste
but
still
sweet
with
the
color
i
was
expecting
some
roastiness
but
no
there
isnt
any
an
interesting
concept
brew
im
guessing
thats
what
it
is
never
heard
of
a
black
ipa
before
cant
wait
to
see
what
they
come
up
with
for
next
years
anniversary
this
is
one
different
beer
but
its
really
good
this
beer
drinks
smells
and
tastes
like
a
mellow
ipa
but
with
the
hints
of
roasted
cofee
and
carmel
youd
expect
from
some
porters
or
a
quadrupel
quite
unique
if
you
get
the
chance
i
suggest
trying
it
i
think
you
should
run
out
and
buy
a
few
of
these
beer
was
poured
into
the
glass
was
inky
black
no
light
would
show
through
3
finger
head
head
dense
and
smoky
in
color
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
overwhelmingly
one
of
grapefruit
odd
but
welcome
taste
was
a
blast
of
hops
very
bitter
followed
by
a
hint
of
sweentness
again
grapefruit
taste
at
the
very
end
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
bit
of
sharpness
to
it
an
exellent
beer
well
worth
the
money
i
spent
but
it
is
a
one
time
thing
i
dont
think
i
want
another
and
least
not
right
now
overall
impression
impressive
color
without
roastiness
a
hop
kick
to
the
palate
i
like
the
darkness
with
the
hop
blast
im
not
sure
what
all
the
controversy
is
about
surrounding
this
beer
the
hops
have
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
and
this
is
a
wellmade
beer
pretty
much
everything
you
sign
up
for
when
you
buy
a
stone
beer
it
wont
be
subtle
its
not
sessionable
but
its
definitely
a
treat
to
be
savored
strongly
recommended
drinkability
if
you
do
anything
other
than
sip
this
you
arent
going
to
be
able
to
recover
and
youll
be
taking
in
sharp
hops
the
whole
time
great
if
you
have
the
time
to
drink
it
i
had
to
split
the
bomber
into
two
sessions
drinkability
a
sipper
for
sure
d
complexity
balance
and
an
arsenal
of
flavor
this
beer
is
fantastic
i
expected
nothing
less
from
stone
but
was
still
blown
away
by
what
i
got
this
one
should
definitely
not
be
missed
and
even
though
its
flavors
and
alcohol
are
dialed
up
it
is
remarkably
drinkable
in
nature
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
12
brown
head
over
the
clear
dark
brown
brew
frothy
head
lasts
and
lasts
with
ample
sticky
lace
aroma
is
pungeant
piney
green
hops
taste
is
bit
lacking
in
the
chewy
malts
one
might
expect
for
such
a
dark
color
but
hops
character
and
bitterness
is
excellent
mouthfeel
is
extra
smooth
and
drinkability
is
great
as
well
yet
another
anniversary
brew
from
stone
that
is
worthy
of
the
milestone
about
drinkability
do
i
want
another
one
yes
do
i
want
it
right
now
i
think
ill
wait
dthis
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
recommend
it
highly
one
of
the
better
beers
i
can
remember
having
in
my
time
on
this
earth
d
there
is
a
fine
taste
in
this
beer
but
it
isnt
mind
boggling
just
hops
hops
and
some
hops
while
i
notice
the
balance
in
terms
of
bittersweet
im
hard
pressed
to
detect
any
malt
flavor
in
the
nose
or
taste
i
liked
this
beer
but
not
enough
for
the
price
and
not
that
special
for
an
anniversary
beer
younger35
youre
still
the
man
looking
forward
to
the
next
exchange
sir
the
nearly
black
appearance
and
the
over
the
top
hops
content
make
this
unique
i
appreciate
both
alcohol
and
hops
but
i
cant
drink
too
much
of
this
however
without
the
bitterness
and
alcohol
becoming
too
overpowering
hence
the
lower
drinkability
score
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
for
a
good
long
while
and
have
been
in
bottle
a
bit
but
on
tap
hot
damn
had
to
pull
out
a
special
beer
to
celebrate
uks
win
over
lsu
even
if
i
dont
like
this
beer
this
is
a
good
day
the
beer
pours
a
lot
like
a
dry
stout
very
dark
brown
nearly
opaque
and
with
a
firm
withstanding
head
formation
and
retention
throughout
its
basically
a
black
beer
aromas
are
very
deceiving
comming
from
a
black
beer
with
a
heavy
citrus
hop
nose
and
backup
notes
of
pine
lemongrass
and
charcoal
the
beer
tastes
similarly
from
the
hops
side
but
the
beer
has
a
different
story
too
the
malts
the
sweet
malt
character
is
very
similar
to
the
candysweet
flavors
found
in
belgian
dark
strong
beers
but
without
the
yeasty
peppery
phenolic
twang
this
beer
is
all
american
with
a
high
attenuation
rate
and
hop
domination
throughout
though
the
hops
side
and
malts
side
make
the
beer
enjoyable
they
may
be
two
separate
beers
caught
in
the
same
bottle
and
need
much
more
melding
together
to
do
as
is
its
a
firm
dipa
with
challenging
malt
character
good
beer
but
time
will
surely
do
it
some
favors
but
as
american
strong
ales
go
i
prefer
arrogant
bastard
overall
a
big
beer
to
celebrate
another
year
for
stone
well
done
to
them
and
a
beer
for
the
rest
of
us
to
celebrate
with
hmm
what
will
i
celebrate
tonight
drinkability
i
made
it
throught
the
bomber
and
would
have
it
again
if
it
was
free
but
i
dont
understand
why
its
so
loved
i
think
the
bastards
are
better
strong
ales
and
id
rather
have
a
straight
up
dipa
if
i
want
the
aggressive
hops
its
still
good
though
and
worth
a
try
overall
this
brew
rocks
stone
creates
another
beauty
drinkability
is
great
seems
more
people
making
a
rich
hoppy
porter
like
brew
and
for
one
i
am
enjoying
them
hope
they
get
more
of
these
in
only
had
a
couple
guess
i
am
lucky
to
get
a
couple
here
in
bristol
but
i
want
more
dit
is
a
good
brew
but
wouldnt
say
its
anything
i
couldnt
live
without
ill
drink
the
rest
of
the
ones
i
have
but
wont
be
buying
any
more
drinkability
is
good
for
an
8
7
abv
quite
sessionable
indeed
very
thickfull
and
syrupy
rough
drinkabilityunbalanced
would
have
like
some
maltiness
in
theremaybe
with
some
aging
a
sipper
for
surejust
one
at
a
time
please
if
you
a
hophead
enjoy
it
nowif
not
might
want
to
sit
on
this
one
a
bit
d
man
is
this
beer
good
i
may
just
have
to
go
buy
a
few
more
bottles
of
this
before
its
gone
the
taste
makes
this
one
a
sipper
but
you
could
really
gulp
these
down
of
course
the
alcohol
catches
up
to
you
the
balance
is
just
awesome
here
please
god
let
more
people
make
black
ipas
seriously
great
work
from
stone
as
always
ive
pretty
much
run
out
of
things
to
say
about
stone
so
i
wont
even
bother
just
know
that
this
beer
lives
up
to
the
brewerys
lofty
standards
if
you
like
big
ipas
and
are
a
fan
of
stones
beers
then
you
have
to
give
this
a
try
but
you
already
knew
that
didnt
you
650ml
bottle
from
henrys
market
pours
a
deep
dark
coffee
brown
color
with
a
khaki
head
that
has
plenty
of
lacing
and
fades
very
slowly
aroma
is
pungent
with
hops
grapefruit
oranges
and
walnuts
flavor
is
ripe
with
oranges
green
cedar
burnt
toast
and
bittersweet
chocolate
all
set
in
a
biter
hops
backdrop
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
light
but
distinct
carbonation
finish
is
more
bitersweet
chocolate
and
hops
this
concoction
tastes
to
me
like
a
threeway
cross
between
arrogant
bastard
ruination
ipa
and
smoked
porter
i
love
it
i
may
get
a
case
to
stash
away
this
should
age
very
well
wow
recommended
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
i
guess
it
is
one
of
those
situations
where
you
look
forward
to
something
for
too
long
a
year
the
complexity
is
good
but
the
balandce
is
not
it
is
great
for
a
hop
head
that
likes
it
dark
but
i
dont
expect
to
be
desperately
seeking
this
one
out
like
i
was
with
last
years
beer
cheers
more
of
a
double
black
ipa
than
the
black
ipa
name
it
has
earned
it
is
reminiscent
of
a
black
ruination
but
slightly
lacking
dlots
o
hops
and
a
good
malt
backbone
what
more
could
you
want
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
offering
from
stone
another
fine
offering
i
could
easily
drink
2
or
3
in
a
row
well
done
my
tongue
says
i
see
what
they
mean
by
black
ipa
though
not
featuring
the
sweetness
or
body
of
an
ris
some
of
the
darkness
limps
through
the
hop
front
line
its
minimal
but
comes
through
with
a
more
roasted
note
theres
a
touch
of
bitterness
from
the
malts
that
plays
with
that
of
the
hops
lots
of
high
aa
nw
hops
ive
never
had
anything
like
this
beer
before
but
im
very
intrigued
by
it
my
best
description
would
be
to
call
it
an
inverse
imperial
stout
its
clearly
a
dipa
first
and
foremost
but
with
a
really
cool
twist
i
cant
wait
to
drink
my
others
stone
has
never
let
me
down
before
and
judging
by
this
11th
anniversary
ale
they
probably
never
will
well
done
sirs
poured
into
a
tulip
tasting
glass
one
word
to
describe
how
this
beer
looks
beautiful
a
very
dark
orangish
brown
with
a
4
in
head
that
settles
to
a
nice
frothy
creamy
brownish
head
the
nose
roasted
nuts
with
a
little
hoppiness
in
the
background
i
am
really
not
sure
how
to
describe
the
taste
other
than
well
balanced
with
a
nice
amount
of
bite
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
but
as
stated
before
well
balanced
the
mouthfeel
right
amount
of
carbination
slightly
viscious
and
slippery
this
is
a
big
beer
as
much
as
i
would
like
to
i
could
probably
only
drink
a
couple
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
nice
fine
foamed
tan
head
that
you
would
expect
on
a
stout
smell
kills
the
idea
that
this
is
a
stout
right
away
big
floral
hops
smell
that
just
blows
me
away
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ever
some
sweet
malt
comes
through
in
the
background
but
it
is
really
the
floral
smell
that
stands
out
taste
is
hoppy
up
front
and
then
big
malts
kick
in
very
sweet
followed
by
a
mild
bitterness
solid
chewy
mouthfeel
that
lets
you
know
there
something
behind
this
one
once
again
a
solid
beer
from
stone
overall
this
is
a
good
dipa
very
much
what
youd
expect
from
stone
on
the
flip
side
theres
not
much
to
distinguish
this
from
their
other
ipas
aside
from
abv
and
looks
drinkability
pretty
much
compels
you
to
take
another
sip
d
great
stuff
but
treat
it
with
respect
pours
a
deep
opaque
amber
almost
black
with
a
tan
head
aromas
of
grapefruity
hops
mellow
and
non
abrasive
in
the
taste
huge
grapefruity
hops
and
a
smooth
maltiness
a
smooth
small
bitterness
mouthfeel
and
a
grapefruity
hop
aftertaste
a
hop
bomb
interesting
in
color
and
style
i
felt
it
tasted
like
an
ipa
and
looked
like
a
porter
not
bad
for
a
strong
ale
its
a
tough
one
for
me
on
the
one
hand
i
expect
a
stone
anniversary
to
be
very
aggressively
hopped
but
the
idea
of
a
black
ipa
is
very
intriguing
but
any
flavor
or
character
that
might
make
this
unique
as
a
black
ipa
is
blown
out
by
the
extreme
hoppiness
i
like
it
but
i
cant
help
thinking
about
what
could
have
been
if
the
roast
or
black
malt
might
have
come
through
a
little
bit
bitter
drying
aftertaste
from
this
medium
body
beer
this
ones
like
a
mix
of
a
dipa
porter
cream
stout
and
a
strong
ale
i
wasnt
sure
at
first
but
as
it
warmed
some
it
really
grew
on
me
stone
does
it
again
if
you
can
still
find
it
buy
it
d
hard
to
put
down
more
than
one
or
two
i
think
but
an
excellent
ale
none
the
less
heres
to
stone
for
another
excellent
brew
pours
a
rich
dark
brownish
black
color
with
cascading
carbonation
coming
after
the
pour
head
is
dark
brown
and
a
thick
3
inches
that
lingers
and
leaves
a
lot
of
great
lacing
aroma
is
hoppy
followed
by
a
toasted
malt
presence
i
can
also
smell
some
grapes
i
believe
taste
is
bitter
followed
by
an
overly
sweet
hoppy
flavor
and
a
lot
of
raisins
making
this
one
seem
like
a
barleywine
type
flavor
mouthfeeling
is
oily
and
soft
carbonation
somewhat
heavy
on
the
alcohol
edit
it
was
so
good
it
inspired
me
to
write
my
first
review
d
i
really
think
its
one
of
stones
more
interesting
offerings
of
late
its
at
least
as
good
as
the
10th
and
will
likely
age
more
gracefully
id
like
to
find
a
few
more
bottles
so
i
can
test
that
theory
i
am
very
pleased
and
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
has
stones
predictable
aftertaste
i
cant
quite
pinpoint
it
overall
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
when
going
into
this
one
i
knew
i
would
be
happy
being
an
ipa
i
very
seldom
am
not
i
was
just
pleased
that
it
stayed
true
to
the
stone
routes
and
was
a
nice
hugely
hopped
vehicle
i
love
that
about
the
stone
products
and
really
do
appreciate
it
i
would
love
to
see
something
like
this
on
tap
or
heck
dry
hopped
on
tap
this
was
a
really
great
offering
and
something
that
i
look
forward
to
having
a
couple
more
of
definitly
have
to
give
this
one
a
try
if
you
can
drinkability
well
this
beer
is
interesting
i
love
the
nose
but
thats
about
it
i
think
its
a
little
sweet
and
a
bit
unbalanced
its
too
sweet
at
times
and
too
bitter
at
others
maybe
a
little
time
would
help
this
a
bit
but
until
then
this
definitely
isnt
my
favorite
offering
from
stone
da
very
interesting
brew
you
know
this
is
a
stone
beer
all
the
way
through
kind
of
like
a
cross
between
their
porter
without
smoking
and
the
ruination
i
will
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
good
and
drinkable
but
i
really
dont
think
this
has
reached
its
best
quite
yet
this
is
a
lot
like
a
mix
of
barley
wine
and
ipa
and
i
think
this
will
be
better
in
two
years
after
the
melon
flavor
mellows
out
some
it
sure
is
dark
for
such
a
hoppy
beer
very
strange
its
good
and
most
drinkers
will
have
a
good
feeling
for
this
one
bottom
line
this
is
another
great
beer
from
stone
well
done
poured
a
rustic
maple
in
color
which
was
nearly
opaque
creamy
white
head
that
stands
nearly
halfinch
high
off
of
the
tap
and
never
really
recedes
leaving
thin
sticky
lacing
around
the
glass
notes
of
bright
tropical
fruit
and
balanced
citrus
hop
resin
faint
hints
of
mustiness
along
with
a
light
biscuit
aroma
the
flavors
are
rounded
tropical
fruit
pineapple
peach
apricot
as
well
as
notes
of
ripe
pinespruce
light
breadiness
very
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
phenolic
mustiness
medium
in
body
smooth
light
as
a
result
of
the
hop
profile
a
double
ipatasting
brew
with
some
great
flavors
and
balance
the
8
7
abv
is
nearly
undetectable
a
must
try
for
stone
fans
great
creation
by
stone
cant
wait
to
have
my
other
one
buy
as
many
bottles
as
you
can
before
this
beer
is
extinct
in
a
couple
months
this
is
one
amazing
concoction
from
stone
yet
again
a
delicious
mixture
of
stoutlike
maltiness
and
a
juicy
and
luscious
hop
character
to
boot
this
is
a
musthave
beer
and
i
must
say
i
havent
had
many
like
it
if
any
get
your
hands
on
one
of
these
babies
if
you
know
whats
good
for
you
leave
it
to
stone
to
create
a
complex
beer
of
difference
im
not
sure
it
fits
in
a
current
category
strong
ale
old
ale
well
not
that
either
stone
calls
it
a
imperial
bpa
black
pale
ale
well
for
me
it
poured
beautifully
the
thick
tan
head
above
a
midnight
black
beer
looked
like
the
perfect
stoutespecially
poured
into
a
pint
guinness
glass
but
the
taste
is
anything
but
that
similar
to
a
stout
the
head
faded
as
the
beer
was
drunk
leaving
a
perfect
lace
ring
to
mark
each
sips
journey
down
the
glass
im
not
sure
i
can
describe
all
the
flavors
im
tasting
first
theres
a
strong
flavor
of
roast
coffee
and
burnt
malt
followed
by
a
winey
nutty
middle
that
ends
with
the
dry
astingency
found
in
this
brewery
most
noted
of
hoppiest
of
beer
like
their
ipa
and
ruinnation
the
winey
flavor
and
the
roasted
hops
converge
to
leave
a
long
lingering
aftertaste
you
will
long
remember
i
had
this
beer
in
bottle
and
on
draft
within
the
last
three
days
the
most
notible
different
was
the
draft
version
had
a
very
noticable
alcohol
burn
id
even
call
it
a
rush
of
warmth
that
doesnt
come
through
in
the
bottle
i
still
want
to
lay
down
a
bottle
of
this
complexed
bottle
of
flavors
for
at
8
70
abv
the
changes
can
only
be
interesting
do
pick
up
a
bottle
drinkability
definite
slow
sipping
beer
but
extremely
satisfying
on
a
flavor
front
this
could
be
considered
a
meal
if
one
had
an
empty
stomach
the
alcohol
does
come
through
as
you
finish
the
bottle
so
more
than
the
one
bomber
bottle
would
be
dangerous
awesome
beer
easily
drinkable
as
the
abv
is
well
hidden
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
bomber
all
to
my
lonesome
although
next
time
i
may
think
about
sharing
this
one
with
a
friend
maybe
very
nice
effort
from
stone
i
preferred
last
years
edition
of
this
beer
but
this
is
not
bad
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
great
its
loaded
with
rich
malt
aroma
as
well
as
tons
of
hops
as
well
its
quite
complex
with
bit
of
roasted
and
black
malts
as
well
the
hops
dominate
the
aroma
theyre
bold
and
add
balance
to
a
hefty
malt
bill
the
taste
is
awesome
it
has
a
pronounced
roasted
malt
character
its
dark
with
a
warming
finish
it
goes
down
hoppy
and
ends
hoppy
what
a
beautiful
beer
the
hops
resinate
after
the
finish
but
a
lingering
roasted
malt
taste
remains
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
kick
ass
beer
one
of
the
best
ipas
ive
ever
had
black
or
not
i
do
enjoy
the
roasted
character
i
think
its
hilarious
what
name
recognition
does
i
tried
a
very
similar
beer
last
week
called
barrelhouse
boss
cox
double
dark
ipa
and
all
the
reviews
are
substantially
lower
than
here
pours
a
very
dark
ruby
almost
black
with
a
couple
fingers
of
lacy
tan
head
that
stays
well
smells
of
grassy
hops
and
a
little
malt
tastes
malty
with
bitter
almost
pineapple
hops
with
a
different
hop
profile
that
im
now
realizing
is
particular
to
this
style
medium
in
the
mouth
with
good
carbonation
took
a
little
time
to
finish
the
better
of
the
two
dark
ipas
that
ive
tried
though
its
not
a
bad
style
i
still
prefer
is
predecessor
sone
should
just
call
this
a
black
ipa
and
brew
it
on
a
regular
basis
not
unlike
cincinnatis
barrel
house
boss
cox
double
ipa
but
with
stones
signature
hops
array
mouthfeel
is
good
despite
a
little
dryness
drinkability
is
above
average
especially
for
a
beer
closing
on
9
abv
im
a
fan
of
this
its
in
the
vein
of
rogues
jls
17
brewer
perhaps
not
quite
as
well
done
but
tasty
none
the
less
makes
me
want
to
brew
a
porter
and
throw
a
bucket
of
hops
into
it
poured
from
bomber
with
much
anticipation
one
of
the
first
limited
release
beers
ive
been
able
to
find
pours
virtually
black
some
ruby
hints
with
light
and
a
1
finger
tan
head
long
lasting
layer
of
head
and
nice
lace
trails
left
behind
smell
is
strong
of
spruce
pine
and
hops
cascade
taste
is
virutally
the
same
strong
hop
notes
up
from
with
a
bit
of
pine
notes
of
roasted
grain
as
well
and
a
hint
of
caramel
just
a
hint
bitter
aftertaste
but
smooth
going
down
light
and
crisp
a
terrific
beer
d
it
drinks
pretty
heavy
but
just
tastes
so
damn
good
ill
be
picking
up
more
of
this
every
chance
i
get
this
is
definately
a
differnt
kind
of
beer
from
stone
and
for
that
i
give
them
my
praise
its
really
not
my
style
of
an
ipa
but
i
cant
hold
that
against
them
too
much
so
its
another
big
beer
from
stone
the
color
is
what
makes
it
different
more
than
anything
else
might
buy
one
more
to
cellar
so
i
can
see
what
lies
beneath
the
hops
but
only
if
i
happen
to
encounter
it
in
a
store
again
before
it
gone
drinkability
is
good
as
is
with
most
of
stones
beers
i
think
i
might
like
this
one
more
than
the
much
acclaimed
10th
anniversary
another
winner
from
stone
and
another
i
wish
would
be
a
year
round
offering
highly
recommended
drinkability
at
first
i
thought
i
would
be
dissapointed
but
this
beer
gets
better
as
you
sip
it
almost
half
way
done
and
its
real
nice
very
solid
beer
not
dissapointed
at
all
curious
to
try
the
9th
anniversary
tomorrow
night
see
how
well
its
aged
stone
continues
to
never
let
me
down
drinkability
pretty
sweet
to
be
a
session
brew
in
fact
one
bomber
was
almost
a
bit
too
much
but
i
wouldnt
turn
down
a
pint
if
offered
another
quality
and
interesting
style
brew
released
by
stone
all
in
all
agreat
beer
but
it
is
a
thinker
d
considering
stones
big
hop
presence
this
just
begs
to
be
quaffed
easily
drinkable
and
really
goes
down
smooth
notes
india
dark
ale
the
bottle
states
that
the
brewers
kept
everybody
in
the
dark
with
this
ipa
and
it
really
is
like
a
hybrid
of
a
few
possible
dark
beer
styles
and
an
ipa
i
guess
strong
ale
is
the
only
classification
that
makes
sense
but
this
beer
has
many
characteristics
of
a
barleywine
ipa
and
even
some
stout
andor
porter
like
traits
i
guarantee
some
will
love
this
and
some
will
hate
it
but
everyone
who
appreciates
craft
beer
should
try
it
me
im
a
fan
ill
have
to
grab
some
more
comment
i
am
not
a
hop
head
this
is
a
bit
heavily
hopped
for
me
however
i
still
enjoyed
it
i
think
the
bitter
sweet
malts
and
citrus
flavors
balance
the
hops
pretty
well
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
unique
beer
overall
excellent
beer
very
unique
i
love
that
stone
always
seems
to
suprise
for
their
aniversary
beer
as
big
as
it
is
much
of
the
flavor
and
the
malt
especially
is
rounded
and
subtle
which
is
a
testament
to
a
fine
blend
of
quality
ingredients
its
a
hoppy
bastard
but
comfortably
overthetop
stonestyle
the
punchy
abv
is
incorporated
and
it
warms
agreeably
making
the
beer
drinkable
and
fun
but
also
a
touch
dangerous
so
happy
anniversary
and
thanks
for
letting
me
in
on
the
celebration
and
ill
revisit
this
one
at
six
months
and
a
year
courtesy
of
my
cellar
d
wow
the
abv
is
felt
quickly
distribution
of
this
beer
is
wide
but
hell
i
might
pick
up
a
few
of
these
as
trade
bait
for
the
future
i
suppose
the
claim
that
it
is
not
a
stout
and
not
a
porter
but
a
black
ipa
is
warranted
it
is
basically
to
a
porter
what
an
ipa
is
to
an
esb
so
really
it
is
a
black
ipa
i
am
guesing
more
breweries
will
produce
one
of
these
soon
i
grabbed
a
half
a
case
and
i
am
kicking
myself
for
not
grabbing
a
full
case
i
will
definitely
be
back
at
the
store
very
soon
to
pick
up
a
full
case
this
is
too
good
pours
a
dark
thick
head
with
heavy
retention
almost
looks
like
a
stout
intense
aroma
of
exotic
fruits
and
spice
hops
are
tantalizing
every
sip
with
smooth
well
rounded
flavour
this
beer
reminds
me
of
hop
rod
rye
but
with
a
little
more
kick
i
recommend
you
pick
up
a
couple
of
these
one
to
sample
and
the
other
to
enjoy
down
the
road
a
bit
once
again
stone
puts
out
another
doozy
for
us
to
admire
and
crave
for
the
next
offering
tasted
like
a
stone
ipa
with
some
chocolate
grape
and
a
bit
of
licorice
a
little
bit
sweet
tootremendous
flavor
i
could
drink
this
all

even
no

changed
this
is
a
good
beer
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
stone
outdid
themselves
with
this
one
they
need
to
redo
this
beer
under
a
different
name
and
make
it
a
year
long
beer
smooth
and
silky
mouthfeel
with
some
oiliness
i
like
this
beer
but
i
prefer
arrogant
bastards
hop
character
still
very
nice
and
highly
recommended
the
aromas
from
the
ipaporterstout
is
a
strong
pine
tree
smell
it
has
a
hoppy
ipa
flavor
with
a
malty
overtone
and
an
alcoholic
taste
the
mouthfeel
leaves
the
hoppiness
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
with
a
thin
body
the
eels
down
your
throat
i
found
this
to
be
a
money
beer
of
this
broad
style
d
this
one
is
too
good
not
to
be
a
regular
in
the
lineup
nearly
perfect
and
a
great
hybrid
style
the
bottom
line
an
interesting
anniversary
beer
by
the
folks
at
stone
i
like
the
hop
character
here
and
im
going
to
be
sad
when
it
is
no
longer
available
because
it
is
currently
in
my
active
rotation
mediumfull
bodied
moderate
carbonation
i
wont
mind
revisiting
this
one
in
the
near
future
get
some
now
lots
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
enjoyed
with
a
good
friend
on
a
friday
evening
appearance
is
very
deceptive
i
was
expecting
something
overly
malty
and
sweet
given
the
dark
reddish
look
of
this
beer
smell
is
very
interesting
very
malty
extremely
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
this
beer
tastes
exceptional
very
well
balanced
very
smooth
and
drinkable
alcohol
taste
is
masked
easily
by
the
loud
flavors
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
others
and
purchase
for
myself
in
the
near
future
i
have
never
tasted
a
beer
similar
to
this
one
it
seems
like
stone
definitely
took
it
upon
themselves
to
make
their
11th
anniversary
a
special
one
drinkability
good
smooth
beer
with
an
above
average
hoppy
ipa
characteristic
highly
recommended
im
not
sure
how
long
my
other
bottle
will
last
great
beer
i
bought
a
case
this
is
a
totally
different
kind
of
ipa
its
dark
nearly
black
in
appearance
the
piney
and
esters
of
an
ipa
are
there
in
the
flavor
but
you
cant
really
taste
any
raw
hops
and
for
good
measure
is
kissed
by
some
cocoa
the
checker
at
the
store
said
he
didnt
like
ipas
but
he
really
enjoyed
this
offering
this
isnt
an
aggressive
beer
like
some
of
the
other
stone
products
but
a
rather
mellow
beer
that
wont
tax
your
palate
too
much
cool
idea
here
black
ipa
id
call
it
hop
cocoa
my
only
qualm
is
that
there
isnt
more
malt
the
hops
are
near
perfect
just
riding
the
line
of
big
but
not
too
big
the
aroma
is
a
very
sweet
fruity
reminds
me
of
the
averys
big
beers
the
flavor
has
a
get
mix
of
hops
flavors
that
change
as
the
beer
warms
it
covers
floral
fruit
punch
citrus
rind
and
finishes
with
an
herbal
black
pepper
taste
yummy
theres
a
touch
of
cocoa
in
the
background
sort
of
like
what
baking
cocoa
adds
to
a
mole
sauce
so
a
pretty
great
beer
i
want
more
like
this
thank
you
stone
nice
a
bit
much
but
oh
so
nice
hefty
westcoast
hops
with
a
charcoal
dark
backing
unique
and
well
get
some
of
this
im
a
fan
of
stone
because
of
their
use
of
hops
and
was
pleased
to
see
and
sample
this
truly
unique
tasty
ipa
dont
miss
it
d
good
overall
not
too
heavy
this
is
a
very
visually
compelling
beer
it
has
all
the
look
of
a
darker
roasted
malt
beer
but
aside
from
looking
the
part
drinks
like
a
double
ipa
has
a
heavy
hop
aroma
even
a
little
piney
then
goes
onto
a
great
hoppy
flavor
throughout
the
palate
some
people
may
wonder
why
a
darkblack
ipa
as
i
drank
through
the
bottle
i
was
consistently
impressed
with
the
visualphysical
contrast
the
xi
presents
a
great
beer
hop
heads
should
enjoy
d
not
bad
at
all
just
very
weird
style
guidelines
be
dammed
pours
an
opaque
darkness
with
mahogany
hued
edges
and
a
two
finger
stiff
tan
colored
head
that
resists
fading
3d
lacing
follows
in
its
wake
the
smell
is
akin
to
an
aggressive
double
ipa
the
aroma
is
primarily
a
grapefruit
hop
full
bodied
the
mouth
feel
is
well
carbonated
but
primarily
conditioned
to
the
grapefruit
character
full
flavored
the
taste
is
a
fruity
grapefruit
hop
with
an
understated
sweet
malt
thing
an
excellent
drinker
the
8
7
abv
is
real
i

of

huge

i
unfortunately
was
not
a
fan
of
this
brew
its
the
first
stone
beer
that
i
can
recall
not
liking
i
just
felt
the
flavours
didnt
mesh
well
at
all
the
numbers
will
show
this
one
as
a
positive
recommendation
then
decided
to
check
out
the
label
a
black
ipa
certainly
sounds
like
something
interesting
to
me
aroma
had
piney
hops
with
a
creamy
tanbrown
head
leaving
lacing
through
the
finish
aroma
is
a
strong
hoppy
presence
if
i
can
be
so
bold
but
it
basically
tastes
like
a
real
good
ipa
with
some
malt
backbone
because
the
only
way
youll
be
disappointed
with
this
product
is
if
it
never
touches
your
lips

and
a
friend

and
very

this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
tasted
from
stone
and
certainly
my
favorite
anniversary
ale
since
8th
this
beer
is
bright
and
should
be
consumed
fresh
drink
it
now
and
savor
the
memories
this
should
age
well
drinkabilit
is
pretty
good
i
could
definitely
polish
off
a
bomber
but
that
is
about
it
i
dont
want
to
go
hoard
this
one
up
like
i
did
the
10
but
it
is
a
tasty
brew
conflict
is
good
another
interesting
and
complex
winner
from
stone
the
back
of
the
bottle
hints
that
this
is
an
ipa
but
filing
it
under
that
category
would
greatly
diminish
its
complexity
this
one
should
age
nicely
so
it
will
be
interesting
to
revisit
in
a
year
or
two
this
stuff
is
that
good
d
i
wish
they
would
make
this
a
standard
release
this
is
damn
good
and
i
can
see
myself
drinking
many
many
more
of
these
while
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
once
its
gone
im
gonna
miss
this
one
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
excellent
abv
is
relatively
high
but
its
perfect
for
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
really
think
i
could
drink
this
all
night
overall
fantastic
offering
from
stone
pick
it
up
now
this
is
a
great
brew
another
notch
on
the
belt
for
stone
really
enjoyable
note
you
cant
really
call
this
an
ipa
as
its
about
as
nonpale
as
they
come
im
going
to
go
with
india
black
ale
iba
for
this
one
great
to
see
the
new
stone
ann
ale
here
in
western
ny
so
quickly
my
second
time
trying
this
new
black
ipa
style
of
beer
my
first
being
rogue
black
brutal
wich
i
had
mixed
feelings
aboutthis
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
but
not
black
some
ruby
colored
highlights
thruought
a
thick
2
finger
head
atop
that
never
completely
settled
just
a
fantastic
creamy
mass
left
with
gobs
of
lace
behind
in
my
impy
pint
glassjust
awesome
mix
of
piney
and
tropical
fruit
hops
and
black
malt
in
the
nose
mainly
i
picked
up
some
pineapple
and
molasses
wich
was
nice
and
it
strayed
away
from
the
one
dimensional
resiny
hop
profile
and
caramel
malt
base
the
hops
are
big
but
so
is
the
black
malt
element
of
this
beer
sure
its
big
and
piney
and
citrusy
but
the
dark
bread
and
molasses
in
there
is
large
as
well
in
finely
balanced
that
black
malt
character
really
shows
itself
the
alcohol
creeps
a
bit
but
this
is
a
very
interesting
brew
it
has
it
all
big
hops
and
some
malty
sweetnessanother
top
notch
brew
form
one
of
the
best
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
fresh
but
i
look
forward
to
experiencing
it
over
time
as
it
is
a
bit
hot
right
now
i
will
give
it
another
shot
later
on
this
week
to
see
what
i
think

not
now
a
welcome

palette
i
already
knew
this
was
going
to
be
a
dark
ipa
but
it
sure
is
black
smell
is
initially
fruity
out
of
the
bottle
and
reminiscent
of
the
vaunted
10th
second
smell
from
the
glass
is
chocolate
and
hops
this
one
is
weird
has
a
chocolate
taste
some
hops
with
fruitiness
and
roastiness
at
the
end
good
stuff
and
makes
me
want
to
revisit
averys
14th
anniversary
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
drink
more
than
one
bomber
for
some
reason
the
chocolate
and
hop
combination
makes
me
think
of
chocolate
mints
fantastically
designed
beer
very
very
nice
ill
miss
this
when
it
is
gone
in
a
word
exceptional
its
hard
not
to
like
a
beer
with
such
intense
flavor
and
aroma
being
somewhat
syrupy
i
thought
it
might
be
a
sipper
but
it
went
down
pretty
easy
once
i
got
used
to
that
this
is
definitely
another
extreme
brew
and
just
what
i
would
expect
from
stone
i
would
argue
its
better
than
the
10th
anniversary
so
stock
on
up
but
also
drink
soon
because
these
hops
will
only
fade
and
it
wont
be
the
same
this
is
most
definitely
an
ipa
inspired
beer
the
lingering
tongue
flagellating
bitterness
in
this
beer
is
huge
astringent
at
times
bracing
palate
dominating
but
thoroughly
enjoyable
for
the
hop
heads
out
there
i
really
hope
this
beer
lasts
longer
than
the
10th
anniversary
beer
for
some
reason
that
one
had
a
2
week
window
where
it
was
a
zesty
hop
bomb
but
after
that
it
became
a
train
wreck
of
flavors
though
ill
have
to
revisit
it
as
some
have
said
it
has
mellowed
recently
anyway
if
you
only
have
one
bottle
drink
it
now
cause
it
is
at
its
peak
fresh
hoppiness
right
now
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
the
dark
malt
character
plays
out
it
is
very
subtle
right
now
and
if
this
was
put
in
a
blind
ipa
tasting
you
would
actually
have
to
be
blind
folded
though
most
would
have
a
hard
time
guessing
this
was
not
a
typical
albeit
supper
hoppy
ipa
a
solid
beer
wtf
not
impressed
at
all
a
little
overcarbonated
but
flavorful
and
enjoyable
very
dark
color
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
caramel
never
drunk
a
black
ipa
before
but
i
guess
this
is
a
very
fine
one
o
i
liked
it
drinkable
but
i
would
never
reach
for
it
again
and
im
glad
i
bought
only
a
single
bottle
to
check
it
out
the
best
before
date
says
apr
07
14
i
guess
that
his
beer
is
brewed
one
year
before
that
day
that
could
probably
explain
why
it
taste
more
like
an
american
porterstout
than
a
black
ipa
o
over
the
course
of
a
few
years
ive
given
tommyknocker
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
every
time
ive
tried
something
of
theirs
and
every
time
ive
poured
their
beer
down
the
drain
i
know
this
sounds
snobbish
but
they
really
have
no
clue
what
theyre
doing
i
wish
i
could
get
proven
wrong
but
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
black
ipa
theres
no
discernible
hop
traits
at
all
heck
its
name
is
hop
strike
theres
barely
any
good
traits
for
a
black
ale
either
the
aroma
is
offensive
and
the
taste
doesnt
make
up
for
it
overall
im
becoming
a
huge
fan
of
the
black
aleipa
this
one
isnt
as
complex
as
id
like
but
still
a
solid
brew
overall
this
black
ipa
is
a
little
more
towards
the
simple
black
ale
side
of
the
black
ale
spectrum
needs
more
hops
in
my
opinion
to
be
a
black
ipa
but
its
still
a
pretty
good
black
ale
o
good
stuff
o
this
isnt
bad
but
it
doesnt
impress
me
3
255
not
super
impressed
with
this
one
i
have
to
wonder
if
the
batch
was
infected
because
of
the
yeasty
character
but
apart
from
that
it
still
just
didnt
strike
me
as
a
particularly
great
black
ipa
it
was
kind
of
all
over
the
place
like
a
cross
between
a
red
ale
a
porter
and
an
ipa
switching
back
and
forth
between
all
of
the
above
not
extreme
in
any
direction
but
a
good
balance
of
roast
and
citrus
not
overly
bitter
either
the
acetone
notes
are
somewhat
offputting
o
this
beer
is
loaded
with
aroma
and
flavor
i
tend
to
gravitate
towards
black
ipas
that
focus
a
little
more
on
hops
but
i
did
enjoy
this
interpretation
the
chocolate
malts
lended
greatly
to
the
smooth
feel
of
this
beer
and
held
a
nice
profile
of
flavor
great
feel
and
is
quite
deceptive
in
strength
o
overall
an
average
rate
of
drinkability
some
level
of
hop
respectability
though
the
complexity
was
rather
lax
and
laid
back
a
c
feels
about
right
here
itd
be
pretty
odd
to
strike
a
vein
of
hop
cones
whilst
pickaxing
through
a
mine
shaft
eh
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
garnetbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offcream
foam
the
nose
comprises
toasted
malts
pine
sap
light
molasses
and
sour
grapefruit
rind
theres
a
strangely
acrid
quality
in
there
despite
the
thick
pall
of
roasty
sweetness
up
front
the
taste
continues
this
harsh
dichotomy
stark
proof
that
disagreements
far
too
often
lead
to
battles
rather
than
orchestrated
discussion
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
a
generally
unattractive
and
clashy
black
ipa
the
two
things
you
wanna
avoid
when
brewing
the
style
idaho
no
you
da
ho
o
meh
not
a
fan
of
the
style
overall
but
im
warming
up
to
it
base
on
entries
by
stone
and
firestone
walker
ill
pass
o
i
found
this
black
ipa
to
be
quite
easy
to
drink
because
it
has
a
good
base
of
malts
supporting
the
hop
bitterness
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
head
was
about
12
fingers
creamy
with
some
lacing
contrary
to
other
reviews
this
had
light
carbonation
and
a
seemingly
thinner
head
this
combined
with
the
black
and
hazy
finish
made
an
pleasing
appearance
i
took
many
liberal
whiffs
of
this
beer
and
i
came
across
what
seemed
to
be
a
strong
and
inviting
toasty
and
smoky
aroma
with
a
slight
sweet
smell
i
tasted
dark
fruit
and
pine
beer
had
a
decent
amount
of
appealing
flavors
that
did
not
linger
too
long
the
beer
was
relatively
smooth
with
an
above
average
full
bodied
sense
but
not
overpowering
hops
and
malts
seemed
to
be
very
balanced
i
may
try
this
again
a
bit
warmer
sample
initially
it
may
have
been
too
cold
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
i
enjoyed
it
though
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
would
certainly
try
it
again
id
recommend
any
black
ipa
fan
to
check
it
out
very
good
aba
not
strong
or
extremely
hoppy
great
balance
of
the
dark
malts
the
rye
spice
and
the
hops
4
0
o
an
easy
drinker
very
enjoyable
id
like
a
second
pint
id
maybe
buy
a
6pack
this
wont
be
the
last
time
i
have
this
one
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
from
colorado
im
going
to
explore
the
tommyknocker
brewerys
portfolio
at
this
point
im
inspired
black
strike
has
struck
me
im
going
to
dive
into
colorado
quality
what
a
nose
on
this
one
real
citrus
and
pine
hop
tones
that
hit
you
when
you
first
open
it
unfortunately
it
drops
to
a
lesser
strength
not
long
after
the
pour
the
flavor
profile
is
nice
but
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
punch
after
the
initial
whiff
of
the
nose
its
still
decent
though
nice
enough
black
ale
tones
that
keep
it
interesting
enough
i
bet
this
would
be
good
on
cask
doubt
ill
ever
see
that
though
worth
trying
not
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
but
its
alright
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
any
real
quantity
of
this
beer
if
it
came
down
to
it
this
beer
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
and
feels
those
are
the
wrong
two
if
you
ask
me
overall
this
was
good
not
really
for
the
hopheads
would
definitely
buy
again
mouthfeel
medium
body
lacks
carbonation
boring
everything
from
the
nose
to
the
roast
profile
to
the
hops
is
pretty
muted
with
this
offering
certainly
drinkable
but
nothing
here
makes
me
want
to
try
it
again
o
pretty
average
black
ipa
not
great
not
terrible
pretty
easy
drinker
tm
medium
resinous
bitterness
with
a
medium
roasted
character
throughout
and
the
chocolate
peppercorn
combo
from
the
nose
as
well
nice
bitter
lingering
finish
medium
body
and
carbonation
levels
keep
things
sharp
but
not
too
sharp
on
the
tongue
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
black
or
brown
ales
i
actually
hate
them
i
love
ipas
however
picked
this
one
up
with
low
expectations
and
only
because
it
said
ipa
but
im
really
fond
of
this
beer
its
a
great
marriage
to
me
of
the
two
styles
although
not
as
hoppy
as
most
regluar
ipas
the
flavors
balance
well
if
i
saw
another
16
oz
of
this
id
definitely
grab
one
but
this
one
wouldnt
be
a
session
beer
consider
me
pleasantly
surprised
feels
mildly
carbonated
full
in
body
oily
slick
and
wets
the
palate
in
the
end
but
has
a
mild
warmth
to
it
better
then
average
hoppy
black
ale
they
call
it
a
black
ipa
on
the
label
worth
a
try
good
stuff
like
to
complexity
and
balance
o
maybe
i
should
have
had
this
beer
fresher
this
one
spent
a
few
months
in
the
fridge
but
for
me
it
was
as
average
as
they
come
not
that
i
wouldnt
enjoy
it
again
just
not
one
to
seek
out
overall
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
are
any
ipas
it
smells
hefty
it
tastes
hefty
it
feels
hefty
it
looks
hefty
i
wish
it
was
a
bit
hoppier
but
its
a
good
one
o
the
flavors
are
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
black
ipa
it
is
on
the
hoppy
side
but
the
toasted
malts
are
robust
enough
to
balance
it
out
i
like
the
fact
that
they
use
rye
malts
because
they
add
a
unique
character
to
the
beer
i
have
had
better
black
ales
but
this
one
is
very
good
and
i
will
probably
get
it

mixed
with
the

dominated
by

some

is
balanced

on

just
like
the

carbonated
slightly
maybe
the

is
in
there
somewhere
on

pretty

i
would
by
again
pretty
good
bottle
of

here
smells
very
hoppy
and
lightly
roasty
nothing
like
some
of
the
other
more
heavy

is
bold

a
good

mouthfeel
is

plenty

and
a

love
the
aftertaste

hoppy
finish
of
this
one
worthy
offering
from
tommyknocker
and
fairly
priced
o
if
anyone
can
tell
me
that
i
had
a
bad
bottle
i
would
be
happy
to
try
it
again
i
like
black
ipas
a
lot
and
was
disappointing
with
it
i
am
just
hoping
it
was
a
bad
bottle
and
not
a
bad
recipe
i
must
have
had
an
old
beer
or
mishandled
beer
based
on
the
ratings
other
have
posted
as
this
is
not
good
at
all
my
favorite
style
or
beer
and
a
beer
i
likely
wont
return
to
opretty
good
not
the
best

but
pretty
good
wouldnt
mind
havin
again

i
anticipated

roasted

finish
with
the

bitterness
coming
through
at
th
end
a
reall
nice
black
ipa
overall
ill
never
try
this
again
but
it
was
interesting
the
beer
tastes
like
liquid
black

the
aftertaste
has
the
usual
black

aftertaste
interesting
and
not
bad

very
nice
12

that
left
a
generous

the
smell
included
sweet

roasted

hint

and
slight

hops
the
taste
was
citrus
hops
roasted
malt
and
sweet
malt
essentially
matching
the
smell
mouth
feel
was
a
medium
body
with
so
so
carbonation
overall
not
the
best

i
have
had

the

made

i
thoroughly
enjoyed

did
my

i
served

as
well
o
i
dont
care
much
for
this
beer
i
find
it
underwhelming
and
the
hop
aspect
severely
underdeveloped
this
is
probably
more
of
a
rye
beer
than
anything
overall
my
only
complaint
about
this
bdeer
is
how
much
it
foams
but
other
than
that
this
is
by
far
my
second
favorite
dark
ipa
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
flavor
which
just
almost
compliments
anything
you
pair
it
with
cheers
to
all
and
happy
new
years
the
taste
is
lightly
roasted
up
front
with
slight
caramel
malt
flavor
and
a
mild
maijuanalike
dank
herbal
taste
and
slight
veggie
tealike
flavor
with
some
astringent
notes
the
taste
has
a
gentle
biscuit
taste
from
the
malt
with
moderate
toffeelike
nutty
and
sweet
sugar
flavor
the
hops
are
minty
and
with
a
subtle
tang
of
fruit
from
the
yeast
gives
a
limelike
tanginess
and
mild
burnt
toast
rounds
out
the
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
i
agree
with
the
majority
who
find
this
to
be
good
decent
enough
beer
but
in
the
scheme
of
black
ipas
this
doesnt
have
enough
hop
flvor
and
is
not
dry
enough
the
roast
isnt
too
far
out
of
place
but
it
has
some
raisinlike
notes
from
the
dark
crystal
that
tend
to
compete
with
the
dank
hops
this
is
a
beer
i
enjoyed
but
dont
think
it
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
from
tommyknocker
i
couldnt
help
but
compare
this
to
iniquity
but
it
pales
in
comparison
very
tasty
black
ipa
and
the
rye
notes
really
shine
in
the
flavor
smooth
and
easy
drinking
a
solid
and
quite
delicious
beerhighly
recommended
the
name
makes
me
think
ipa
but
this
is
more
of
a
mildly
hoppy
stout
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
drinkable
but
the
name
is
confusing
its
a
stout
with
no
more
hops
than
any
other
stout
for
me
d
very
impressed
with
this
tommyknocker
brew
and
truth
be
told
i
havent
really
liked
anything
else
by
them
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
and
be
perfectly
content
recommended
for
dank
summit
hoprye
fans
o
i
think
this
is
tommyknockers
best
that
ive
had
to
date
no
off
flavors
and
this
is
pretty
tasty
well
balanced
overall
this
was
a
very
solid
beer
reminded
me
of
some
hoppy
porters
out
there
new

did
get

so
a
little
dated
but
pours
a
nice
hearty
black
color
with
a
nice
off
white
two
finger
head
has
a
powerful
hop
aroma
with
a
nice
hint
of
the
rye
tastes
exactly
how
it
smells
hoppy
up
front
with
a
hearty
malt
backbone
and
a
spicy
rye
finish
overall
a
very
nice
and
different
take
on
a
newer
style
of
brew
othis
is
a
good
beer
nothing
world
class
but
it
is
a
solid
entry
into
the
category
overall
a
decent
black
ipa
but
not
one
of
the
better
ones
overall
an
average
beer
not
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
for
but
not
as
good
i
have
had
black
ales
before
that
are
nowhere
near
as
hoppy
when
these
are
all
categorized
together
it
makes
it
harder
to
find
a
beer
like
this
one
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
it
though
especially
if
you
like
ipas
this
is
a
complex
beer
it
might
be
my
favorite
from
tommyknocker
the
only
thing
that
wouldve
made
it
better
was
a
little
more
hoppy
flavor
that
the
ipa
name
suggests
if
anything
it
wouldve
just
added
to
the
cocktail
of
flavors
this
beer
already
packs
o
certainly
not
easy
drinking
or
something
i
would
come
back
to
though
this
is
admittedly
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
pretty
decent
brew
that
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
d
in
interesting
brew
without
any
doubt
arguably
the
best
tommyknocker
brew
that
ive
had
to
date
note
my
favorite
beer
but
one
that
challenges
the
palette
and
displays
the
artisanship
in
beer
worthy
of
seeking
out
and
trying
for
the
curious
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
its
about
halfway
between
rye
ipa
and
porter
ambiguity
intended
overall
real
good
black
ipa
and
worth
a
try

a
fine
brew
note
live
review
overall
impression
this
is
a
lower
midrange
black
ipa
that
doesnt
benefit
from
rye
malt
i
liked
the
flavorful
aggressiveness
of
this
with
the
rye
and
hops
not
disappointing
here
yet
this
was
just
balanced
enough
so
that
things
didnt
get
too
overthetop
this
was
a
solid
pickup
and
probably
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
yet
from
tommyknocker
overall
its
a
decent
brew
and
for
me
one
of
the
better
releases
from
tommyknocker
this
beer
has
a
little
of
everything
that
i
love
im
a
huge
fan
of
the
black
ipa
movement
and
im
also
a
huge
fan
of
rye
beers
the
rye
is
subdued
until
the
beer
warms
leaving
one
with
the
impression
that
this
is
just
another
decent
black
ipa
once
the
beer
warms
though
the
rye
is
noticeable
and
works
so
well
with
the
roasted
malts
and
the
hop
character
this
is
a
beer
worth
checking
out
overall
strike
illustrates
why
black
ipas
exist
definitely
get
some
if
you
can
its
so
good
ok
tommyknockers
you
got
me
this
time
great
presentation
great
nose
flavor
and
body
o
this
is
a
really
nice
black
alerye
ipa
one
of
the
better
brews
from
tommyknocker
o
interesting
excellent
beer
recommended
would
definitely
have
again
o
not
bad
not
too
interesting
not
as
much
hops
as
id
like
but
its
ok
not
a
bad
rye
beer
almost
pulled
together
for
a
better
score
still
one
id
try
again
if
jonesing
for
a
rye
beer
not
my
favorite
black
ipa
i
wanted
more
of
the
black
side
of
things
and
the
grapefruit
is
way
too
much
for
my
taste
medium
body
well
carbonated
sticky
and
dry
on
the
tongue
drinks
really
well
an
interesting
and
tasty
hybrid
style
which
doesnt
go
way
over
the
top
but
succeeds
in
blending
a
few
different
profiles
discovered
at
the
mellow
mushroom
in
greensboro
nc
this
one
is
a
dark
black
transluscent
mohogany
color
with
a
flimsy
light
tan
head
and
modest
lacing
the
aroma
is
grapey
cream
soda
with
bold
and
beautiful
pine
hops
and
light
bready
malt
very
nice
put
to
the
palate
im
tasting
lots
of
delicious
root
beer
malt
sweetness
and
intense
charcoal
pine
hops
beautiful
flavor
with
a
mediumlight
bodied
brew
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
crisp
feel
for
the
style
a
great
hop
brew
with
personality
that
seems
very
drinkable
to
me
overall
impression
this
reminds
me
of
founders
black
rye
bottle
says
its
a
black
ipa
but
the
strong
rye
character
takes
it
to
another
much
more
interesting
level
i
havent
been
impressed
by
anything
tommyknocker
has
done
so
im
completely
blown
away
by
this
strong
work
o
my
favorite
balck
ipa
to
date
is
stones
15
aniversary
this
is
nothing
like
that
but
just
as
enjoyable
i
really
dig
how
this
style
is
now
being
duplicated
by
enough
brewers
to
have
a
wide
variety
or
flavors
this
is
a
must
try
this
is
a
jack

complex

roasted
malts
hit
me
right
away
with
grapefruity
hops
soon
to
follow
resin
and
a

a
good
mix
of
all
the
aforementioned
qualities
in
the
taste
with
the
resinous
and
citrusy
hops
taking
the

a

roasty

slight

with

bready

distinction
nice
i
liked
it
medium

moderate

full
of
flavor
and
quite
nice
to
drink
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
but
not
the
best
overall
i
appreciate
that
tommyknocker
was
running
with
this
idea
of
a
good
hoppy
rye
beer
and
i
wish
it
worked
for
me
but
whatever
this
was
it
did
not
work
maybe
try
some
different
hops
that
gel
better
with
the
rye
or
get
away
from
that
roasted
malt
and
try
a
sweeter
or
bready
malt
overall
a
good
ipa
with
nice
color
well
balanced
i
would
drink
again
but
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
again
moreys
bottom
line
this
is
one
of
the
easier
drinking
black
ipas
that
ive
had
i
could
probably
do
a
six
pack
on
a
cool
fall
evening
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
it
kind
of
missed
the
mark
of
my
expectations
d
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
most
of
the
black
ipas
out
there
and
this
one
did
not
disappoint
i
must
say
this
brew
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
have
not
been
terribly
impressed
with
tommyknocker
in
the
past
but
this
brew
is
really
well
put
together
and
quite
tasty
if
this
were
just
a
india
black
ale
i
am
not
sure
how
good
it
would
be
but
that
rye
really
puts
it
over
the
edge
very
tasty
overall
the
flavors
dont
mesh
at
all
it
just
tastes
weird
with
the
harsh
tarry
bitterness
spicy
rye
and
sweet
malt
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
color
45
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
hint
of
rye
and
slight
citrus
hops
fits
the
style
of
an
american
ipa
or
an
american
black
ale
not
a
rye
beer
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
hops
roasted
malt
and
sweet
malt
overall
not
complex
but
very
well
blended
a
really
good
beer
but
almost
a
great
beer
if
i
could
i
would
ditch
the
rye
replace
it
with
pale
2row
and
knock
down
the
ibus
to
maybe
6064
an
interesting
beer
and
a
nice
mix
of
styles
im
not
to
big
on
the
black
ipa
concept
as
it
defeats
the
purpose
but
the
rye
aspect
in
hop
strike
makes
for
something
new
although
not
a
everyday
beer
and
at
that
only
one
o
as
i
mentioned
this
would
have
been
a
good
porter
or
rye
beer
but
as
a
black
ipa
as
the
label
implies
im
not
impressed
as
with
their
pick
axe
ipa
which
is
really
a
pale
ale
they
have
tried
to
do
the
same
with
this
beer
with
is
really
a
rye
beer
too
bad
cause
this
could
be
decent
as
a
porter
nice
beer
i
liked
it
and
maybe
w
a
few
tweaks
this
could
be
an
off
the
charts
black
ipa
but
for
right
now
its
good
and
worth
checking
out
this
was
fresh
and
smelling
so
good
mouthfeel
bitterness
lingers
and
dries
up
the
mouth
in
a
not
so
nice
way
good
body
and
good
carbonation
thick
hoppy
goodness
a
rich
aroma
with
a
hint
of
spice
comes
through
on
the
nose
right
away
really
nice
blended
notes
of
pine
resin
warm
malts
a
nice
touch
of
buttery
middle
and
a
touch
of
rye
really
well
done
and
this
carries
over
to
the
flavor
perfectly
smooth
effortless
feel
on
this
one
delivers
a
light
hoppy
goodness
with
hints
f
spiced
rye
and
buttery
malts
nice
clean
finish
with
a
light
dryness
and
a
touch
of
kick
pours
a
deep
black
in
color
with
a
decent
off
white
foam
cap
with
large
soapy
bubbles
leaving
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
decidedly
malty
lots
of
caramel
and
toasted
malts
upfront
in
the
taste
malty
again
with
alittle
rye
spice
and
small
hop
presence
in
the
finish
mostly
caramel
roast
and
slight
coffee
flavors
dry
cocoa
alittle
flowery
citrus
and
mild
bitterness
on
the
back
end
medium
to
full
bodied
feel
overall
a
decent
black
ipa
with
a
small
rye
and
hop
presence
overall
i
dont
think
i
love
the
idea
since
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
rye
beers
but
it
does
add
a
dimension
to
the
black
ipa
i
have
not
yet
seen
in
any
other
beer
drinkable
and
kinda
glad
i
have
3
more
will
have
to
try
it
again
after
a
heavy
stout
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
wont
be
my
last
overall
i
would
pen
this
more
as
a
black
ipa
than
a
rye
brew
very
good
and
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
as
my
first
and
only
commercial
example
of
a
black
rye
ipa
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
the
style
i
hope
i
have
the
opportunity
to
more
examples
of
the
style
but
until
then
i
believe
tommyknocker
did
an
excellent
job
brewing
up
another
master
piece
prost
o
really
good
beer
and
the
rye
goes
well
with
the
roastiness
d
i
expected
this
to
be
very
hoppy
and
the
aroma
more
or
less
reinforced
that
assumption
i
was
then
surprised
to
find
that
the
malt
almost
completely
dominated
the
flavor
profile
there
is
a
lot
of
dark
sugar
and
even
more
rye
character
this
beer
has
more
actual
rye
flavor
than
any
other
i
have
had
in
interesting
take
on
the
black
ipa
idea
and
probably
the
best
tommyknocker
beer
i
have
tried
so
far
o
a
solid
offering
from
tommyknocker
nice
ryeblack
ipa
offering
at
8
99
a
six
pack
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
price
too
thin
but
still
quite
a
good
beer
seek
out
sampled
from
a
16oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
dark
brown
to
black
in
color
with
a
deep
muddy
haze
started
with
a
short
bubbly
froth
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
bubbly
light
wispy
cap
roasted
and
chocolate
malt
aromas
with
citrus
hop
aromas
struggling
to
show
through
creamy
smooth
with
tight
subdued
carbonation
dark
roasted
malt
up

with
chocolaate
malt
and
roasted
coffee
following
through

kickin
in
the
middle
as
well
and
slowly
overwhelm
the
roasted
maltiness
finishes
semidry
with
a
hoppy
espressolike
bitterness
the
flavor
profile
improved
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
if
it
wasnt
called
a
black
ipa
i
would
have
calledit
a
hoppy
stout
this
style
is
still
a
bit
undefined
for
me
i
didnt
get
the
hop
forward
character
that
other
reviews
reported
this
brew
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
finger
of
whitish
head
that
fades
quickly
the
aroma
is
nice
its
quite
complex
with
citrus
and
piney
hops
roasted
malts
and
a
nice
rye
twang
the
taste
is
very
nice
the
hops
are
forward
the
whole
time
but
theres
a
nice
roasted
malt
and
coffee
presence
in
the
back
with
some
rye
sneaking
in
on
the
backend
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
quite
crisp
and
has
a
fairly
light
body
for
the
style
the
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
a
very
nice
black
ipa
hop
strike
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
tommyknocker
and
like
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
from
colorado
breweries
i
am
impressed
im
not
entirely
sold
on
black
ipas
but
this
is
a
good
hoppy
beer
with
a
dark
rye
twist
taste
again
hops
are
large
and
in
charge
dominate
the
flavor
charge
the
palate
tingly
spicy
bitter
hops
choked
back
by
chocolate
malt
a
difficult
dance
one
ive
not
enjoyed
in
the
past
and
im
not
sure
im
100
with
this
one
either
its
a
tough
clash
of
disparate
flavors
bitter
and
sweet
tangy
tart
and
treacly
somehow
it
works
but
im
still
not
completely
convinced
however
its
tasty
and
theres
no
serious
competition
between
the
diverse
elements
im
happy
with
it
its
going
down
nice
and
easy
overall
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
enjoy
nice
flavors
to
this
beer
ryeblackipa
seems
to
combine
all
the
trends
in
the
beer
world
today
in
addition
it
drinks
like
a
stout
a
low
carbonated
sipper
with
hop
flavors
and
no
alcohol
feel
interesting
all
the
ingrdients
make
an
impression
and
at
the
very
least
this
is
worth
trying
due
to
being
so
unique
o
a
nice
little
beer
i
think
the
style
is
correct
as
a
rye
beer
because
its
not
bitter
enough
for
an
ipa
overall
but
it
does
have
its
ipa
moments
as
well
i
would
buy
this
again
first
beer
ive
had
from
tommyknocker
and
i
would
be
interested
to
try
others
from
them
this
hopstrike
pours
out
as
a
very
nice
looking
black
ale
with
a
brown
colored
head
on
top
i
found
the
lacing
to
be
pretty
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
well
blended
balance
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
i
wasnt
able
to
pick
up
much
rye
on
the
nose
though
the
flavor
was
rich
with
hops
and
dark
malty
flavors
again
the
rye
was
almost
too
subtle
for
me
to
pick
up
on
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
nice
here
it
had
a
good
body
to
it
and
left
a
dry
feeling
in
your
mouth
overall
its
not
a
bad
black
ipa
but
its
not
my
favorite
either
o
a
very
fine
black
rye
ipa
with
sensory
characteristics
that
match
the
proclaimed
style
if
a
bit
less
hoppy
than
the
usual
ipa
drinkability
i
enjoyed
sipping
my
way
through
this
one
and
each
sip
followed
easily
from
the
one
before
it
while
there
are
some
other
beers
in
this
style
id
choose
over
this
one
ill
be
quite
happy
to
have
it
again
next
time
i
find
it
on
offer
my
overall
impression
is
that
the
beer
is
well
made
while
i
prefer
a
touch
more
dryness
in
the
finish
and
to
me
it
seems
to
lack
some
of
the
complexity
of
a
few
other
examples
ive
had
its
nonetheless
a
good
beer
and
well
worth
trying
pours
a
nice
cola
like
color
with
a
khaki
colored
one
to
one
and
a
half
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
a
nice
tight
head
of
retention
the
are
rings
of
lace
up
and
down
the
glass
very
nice
look
to
this
beer
the
aroma
is
of
coco
and
roasted
malts
along
with
rye
spiciness
and
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
has
a
nice
rye
spiciness
over
top
of
a
dark
chocolate
malt
taste
there
is
also
a
hint
of
dark
fruits
the
end
is
finished
up
with
a
slight
citrus
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
it
is
very
enjoyable
but
it
didnt
do
anything
over
the
top
its
a
beer
to
like
but
not
to
love
passed
on
this
one
in
the
16
ounce
bottle
for
about
4
bucks
due
to
pricelack
of
interest
now
that
this
one
is
available
in
a
more
reasonably
priced
six
pack
i
decided
to
try
it
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
moderate
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
pine
on
the
palate
this
one
is
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
coffee
roasted
malt
and
hops
othis
has
to
be
the
best
toomyknocker
beer
i
have
had
it
all
comes
together
very
nicely
and
this
is
a
beer
i
would
love
to
drink
just
about
anytime
not
saying
it
is
epic
but
still
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
rye
is
somewhat
weak
but
it
still
tastes
good
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
surpassed
my
expectations
of
a
beer
that
i
have
kept
in
my
fridge
for
a
few
months
worth
trying
overall
good
to
have
had
given
to
me
but
i
dont
think
id
go
out
and
buy
some
left
something
to
be
desired
it
is
the
first
black
rye
ipa
i
have
come
across
and
i
like
it
for
that
i
wish
it
had
some
more
flavor
to
it
more
rye
or
malt
either
one
would
work
well
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
showcases
how
versatile
rye
beers
can
be
and
how
well
hops
can
compliment
it
everything
was
pretty
much
spot
on
for
the
style
and
the
addition
of
rye
put
a
nice
subtle
spin
on
a
black
ipa
it
could
have
used
just
a
little
more
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
everything
ended
up
pretty
balanced
and
complex
i
would
buy
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
black
ipa
but
i
think
i
like
furry
just
a
little
bit
more
if
you
like
black
ipas
give
this
one
a
try
i
am
starting
to
be
a
fan
of
tommyknocker
their
mixed
six
was
good
and
so
was
this
beer
i
wonder
what
else
they
have
to
offer
o
overall
this
was
just
okay
for
me
i
would
love
to
rereview
fresh
on
tap
o
lackluster
and
simplistic
but
the
drinkability
is
good
i
just
feel
as
if
something
is
missing
from
this
beer
let
me
start
out
by
saying
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
colorado
beers
i
know
that
sounds
like
an
unfair
statement
and
it
probably
is
however
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
my
friends
im
grateful
to
my
wonderful
wife
for
picking
this
one
from
a
shelve
of
hundreds
i
was
just
a
bit
letdown
that
the
rye
aspect
of
the
beer
did
not
shine
through
more
but
overall
a
good
beer
nonetheless
some
caramel
notes
and
moderate
roast
to
the
malt
hopping
was
sharp
and
i
would
put
this
in
the
black
ipa
category
where
brewers
are
starting
to
express
a
bit
of
creativity
this
seems
a
black
ipa
with
rye
hop
strike
fulfills
the
categorical
style
of
a
black
ipa
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
style
definer
in
taste
tests
to
show
newbies
where
the
center
of
the
catchers
mitt
is
soft
it
lacks
only
an
effort
to
accentuate
a
character
of
the
style
meaning
the
special
attention
that
brewers
labor
for
when
trying
to
get
someone
in
the
choir
to
solo
i
think
this
beer
is
well
made
for
the
black
ipa
style
technically
mouthfeel
is
crisp
smooth
and
thinner
than
youd
expect
from
a
dark
beer
like
this
the
malts
are
hidden
well
in
terms
of
the
feel
especially
considering
how
strongly
they
taste
could
be
a
bit
fuller
though
drinkability
is
excellent
due
to
the
dry
end
and
the
flavors
are
balanced
enough
that
the
beer
remains
easy
to
down
til
the
end
great
beer
shame
it
was
brewed
only
once
according
to
this
site
anyways
drinkability
very
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
drinkable
yeah
wish
i
had
another
pours
a
deep
amber
to
brown
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
grapefruit
hops
in
the
taste
grapefruity
hops
and
a
small
coffee
like
roast
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
grapefruity
hop
in
the
aftertaste
light
body
and
a
big
hop
i
liked
it
alot
more
and
more
i
question
the
whole
black
ipa
style
and
throwing
another
component
in
made
for
even
less
clarity
if
youre
in
to
bipas
give
it
a
try
otherwise
im
not
so
sure
pours
dark
brown
with
not
much
of
a
tan
head
it
doesnt
have
much
of
an
aroma
the
taste
is
good
with
the
spicy
rye
followed
by
hops
95ibu
and
finishing
with
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
what
i
like
with
this
one
the
carbonation
is
pretty
big
here
and
coupled
with
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
this
is
really
a
kick
in
the
teeth
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
much
more
than
one
bottle
a
really
different
black
ipa
hard
to
compare
with
others
of
the
same
style
without
the
rye
this
is
7
but
its
a
session
beer
in
my
opinion
no
doubt
this
is
every
single
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
beer
rolled
into
one
rye
chocolaty
malts
good
hop
bite
it
is
not
too
much
of
either
which
avoids
turning
it
into
a
sort
of
onions
and
ice
cream
matchup
still
i
am
not
blown
away
by
anything
here
but
i
am
hotdamn
satisfied
and
will
absolutely
reach
for
it
again
d
meh
i
wasnt
too
awful
impressed
with
this
beer
it
is
my
first
rye
beer
so
maybe
my
palate
isnt
in
tune
with
the
rye
beers
d
easy
to
drink
what
a
great
offering
from
tommyknocker
by
far
my
favorite
from
them
16oz
bottle
into
a
hopus
tulip
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
decent
frothy
khaki
head
that
lasts
as
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
dark
malts
and
rye
with
a
slight
amount
of
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
chocolate
malts
citrus
hops
and
rye
with
a
nice
lingering
bitter
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
one
i
would
certainly
have
again
drinkability
was
also
good
perhaps
you
might
not
want
to
drink
large
amounts
of
this
complex
beer
in
a
short
time
very
easy
drinker
a
cool
unique
take
on
the
bipa
style
on
tap
at
the
mellow
here
in
gboro
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
chocolate
brown
with
a
half
finger
off
white
head
atopmild
leafy
hop
and
earthy
tones
in
the
nosethe
rye
is
subdued
flavors
are
a
good
mix
of
dark
breadbitter
chocolateand
herbalcitric
hopsall
come
together
pretty
well
the
hops
dont
strike
to
hard
but
its
a
nice
well
rounded
ryecda
hybrid
to
be
had
its
an
easy
drinker
a
decent
beer
with
some
interesting
qualities
but
nothing
outstanding
pours
like
a
stout
looks
like
a
stout
looks
better
than
it
tastes
but
the
finish
is
off
to
my
taste
buds
its
decent
enough
but
i
really
didnt
like
the
finish
maybe
its
the
sharp
rye
bite
but
it
finished
like
burnt
malt
and
i
couldnt
get
that
taste
to
go
away
i
had
one
on
tap
and
could
never
enjoy
drinking
two
worth
a
shot
but
to
a
pure
ipa
guy
this
one
is
just
about
average
but
its
nice
to
see
someone
try
something
different
than
spitting
out
another
smuttynose
close
as
an
example
kudos
on
the
effort
but
like
most
things
everyone
is
different
and
i
might
give
it
another
shot
my
1st
black
ipa
so
perhaps
a
me
thing
relaxingly
smooth
not
heavy
or
syrupy
but
a
wonderful
tingle
along
the
way
ending
in
a
solem
burn
of
spicy
hops
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
out
of
a
16oz
bottle
pours
a
murky
and
dark
mahogany
with
a
fairly
thin
beige
head
that
recedes
into
a
lasting
veil
i
have
to
admit
i
was
not
expecting
a
lot
as
ive
had
a
few
other
offerings
from
tommyknocker
however
i
knew
after
my
first
whiff
that
this
one
was
different
great
mixture
of
citrus
and
pine
dominates
the
aroma
rye
is
plentiful
as
well
as
a
hint
of
bitter
chocolate
theres
also
just
the
slightest
touch
of
burnt
woody
or
nutty
tone
taste
is
great
theres
enough
malt
to
give
decent
balance
but
the
hops
stand
out
as
they
should
grapefruit
really
owns
the
front
giving
way
to
the
bittery
chocolate
and
rye
i
was
left
with
a
lingering
bitter
taste
of
iced
black
coffee
if
i
had
to
nitpick
id
say
feel
was
on
the
thin
side
really
nice
beer
by
tommyknocker
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
with
a
nice
tempting
rye
overtone
and
just
a
teeny
hint
of
molasses
it
pours
a
dark
nearly
opaque
mahogany
brown
with
a
fair
finebubbled
pale
tan
head
flavor
has
tones
of
hops
and
rye
some
bitterness
but
not
too
much
and
hints
of
malt
and
caramel
texture
is
rough
and
tingly
hardly
smooth
quite
pleasing
if
you
like
unusual
ipas
this
one
is
right
up
your
alley
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pitch
black
color
with
thin
cocoa
head
that
fades
fairly
fast
and
turns
into
a
white
lacing
smells
chocolatety
but
that
is
pretty
subtle
there
is
a
little
pine
to
the
taste
and
some
hop
presence
that
is
mostly
on
the
after
taste
an
interesting
tingle
on
the
tongue
that
is
not
the
most
pleasant
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
it
tastes
pretty
good
but
is
a
little
heavy
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
this
on
tap
but
it
is
definitely
more
enjoyable
that
way
d
this
is
a
really
nice
offering
from
tommyknockertheir
best
that
ive
had
this
is
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
rye
pa
nice
work
guys
my
first
rye
ipa
first
and
foremost
are
the
roasted
malts
i
taste
the
hops
but
theyre
subdued
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
not
as
much
as
a
regular
ipa
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
pours
a
deep
dark
garnet
or
mahogany
with
a
scant
fingers
worth
of
foam
shortly
after
pouring
the
tan
head
dissipates
leaving
a
heavy
lacing
at
the
top
of
my
glass
which
stuck
there
all
the
way
through
mild
hop
aroma
less
than
ive
gotten
from
most
black
ipas
chocolate
malts
prominent
in
the
aroma
overall
a
pleasant
combination
that
leans
toward
malty
big
hop
flavor
very
evenly
matched
by
the
dark
malts
superbly
balanced
lingering
flavors
of
rye
and
citrus
rind
body
is
light
mouthfeel
is
slightly
effervescent
i
think
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
new
style
and
the
use
of
rye
makes
it
a
bit
unique
very
good
but
theres
a
bit
too
much
astringency
for
me
to
run
out
for
more
of
this
on
the
other
hand
i
cant
really
think
of
a
better
beer
to
pair
with
a
reuben
sammich
but
im
open
to
suggestions
pours
really
dark
almost
black
with
a
fairly
short
head
but
good
lacing
nice
bitter
smell
with
some
firm
black
malt
background
tastes
great
with
bitter
pine
firm
malt
roasted
grains
pretty
good
beer
even
surprisingly
good
i
like
all
these
black
ipas
and
this
brewery
tends
to
be
a
little
timid
or
too
onenote
but
this
beer
is
right
on
spot
although
this
misses
the
mark
a
little
bit
for
a
black
ipa
it
is
rather
good
overall
and
highly
drinkable
tastecocoa
porter
and
citrussy
ipa
combo
of
flavors
milk
chocolate
smoky
citrus
hop
bite
and
a
spicy
rye
profile
make
this
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
brew
a
little
different
taste
with
every
sip
very
flavorful
but
a
bit
thinbodied
in
the
mouthfeel
keeps
this
brew
from
being
truly
exceptional
still
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
beer
would
pair
nicely
with
smothered
burritos
yum
tommyknocker
hop
strike
ryeipa
is
good
beer
that
would
have
a
chance
to
be
better
beer
with
a
few
wellchosen
tweaks
my
suggestions
25
more
malt
50
more
hops
better
bubbles
and
jettison
the
summit
hops
heres
hoping
the
brewery
plans
a
yearround
release
d
not
too
bad
to
drink
not
the
best
by
any
means
but
have
had
much
worse
16
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
tan

head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
aroma
is
citrusy
grapefruit
and
pine
hops
rye
chocolate
and
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
with
the
rye
being
a
bit
weak
in
the
flavor
at
first
but
becoming
much
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
little
bit
slick
and
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
its
smooth
and
its
an
enjoyable
brew
i
think
this
is
a
solid
overall
beer
id
buy
this
again
pours
kind
of
a
ruddy
dirt
brown
color
hazy
with
smallish
tan

nose
is
simple
citrus

with
a

is
pretty
good
big

a

spiciness
some
more
substantial

come
through
on

toast
hints
of

pretty
thin
mf
but
really
refreshing
drink
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
very
nice
black
ipa
and
i
really
dig
the
extra
kick
the
rye
gives
progresses
well
from
cold
to
warm
a
lot
of
hops
and
bitterness
cold
and
the
chocolate
malt
coming
to
the
forefront
as
it
warms
up
nice
you
know
after
a
big
mountain
drive
i
often
head
for
tommyknockers
now
i
know
theres
some
alternatives
like
summit
county
with
backcountry
and
dam
brewery
and
the
golden
city
brewery
and
others
but
tommyknocker
puts
out
some
fine
brews
especially
at
the
brewery
reminds
me
of
abita
in
louisiana
if
you
only
get
the
beers
in
6packs
at
your
local
grocery
store
then
yeah
theyre
soso
but
at
the
brewery
you
often
find
the
gems
and
the
atmosphere
can
be
compelling
anyway
i
happily
digress
id
say
this
is
a
fine
black
ipa
and
i
like
that
style
ill
admit
however
lately
its
been
difficult
because
they
have
also
had
a
fresh
hop
with
hops
from
montrose
co
and
they
have
a
fine
saison
at
less
than
5
and
theres
the
oaked
butthead
bock
and
the
always
lovely
imperial
nut
brown
but
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
ive
picked
growler
refills
of
the
hop
strike
nice
aroma
color
tastes
of
some
hops
being
challenged
by
mild
dark
malts
with
a
nice
overall
profile
refreshing
and
satisfying
ayieee
dvery
drinkable
over
and
over
mouthfeel
is
silky
smooth
and
perfectly
carbonation
this
really
isnt
my
style
or
something
i
would
seek
out
but
given
what
it
is
i
think
tommyknocker
did
a
spectacular
job
on
this
one
drinkability
was
good
nice
blend
of
flavors
that
still
leaned
toward
ipa
no
signs
of
abv
d
ive
only
had
a
few
beers
from
these
guys
but
ive
liked
them
for
the
most
part
maybe
not
the
most
amazing
black
ipa
but
quite
good
i
almost
never
buy
tommyknocker
beers
but
i
thought
what
the
hell
since
i
am
a
sucker
for
ipas
dark
brownblack
in
color
with
a
decent
head
and
lacing
it
has
a
skunked
smell
to
it
that
must
be
from
hops
but
i
do
not
find
it
pleasant
at
all
and
i
enjoy
a
nice
dank
smell
this
was
ewww
colombus
hops
the
flavor
was
a
little
citrus
from
the
hops
chocolate
and
the
rye
must
be
messing
with
me
because
i
then
get
a
smoky
nastiness
just
not
good
at
all
it
gets
slightly
better
as
it
warms
but
overall
i
would
not
buy
this
again
update

had
a
bottle
and
the
thought
the
balance
of
hops
dark
grains
and
rye
had
improved
its
a
fine
example
of
a
black
ipa
as
well
as
a
rye
beer
the
floral
juicy
citrus
hops
lead
to
spicy
rye
which
finishes
with
chocolate
grains
and
a
final
hoppy
kick
good
carbonation
and
excellent
drinkability
i
love
me
some
dark
rye
beers
and
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
will
have
to
head
up
to
the
brewery
and
try
this
on
tap
if
you
can
get
your
ahnds
on
this
its
woeth
the
try
one
of
the
better
rye
beers
ive
had
lately
there
are
assertive
hops
in
the
nose
flavor
and
especially
the
finish
which
is
a
long
bitter
hop
character
and
the
most
appealing
part
of
this
one
big
big
finish
worth
the
try
and
would
likely
try
again
especially
with
food
d
i
enjoyed
it
well
enough
but
went
to
something
else
for
my
2nd
beer
would
much
prefer
something
like
a
founders
el
diablo
de
noche
at
the
brewery
during
gabf
dit
hides
the
plusminus
7abv
very
well
it
is
a
complex
well
integrated
beer
that
i
could
have
two
or
three
of
highly
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
though
i
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
carbonation
as
i
had
predicted
the
flatness
caused
the
feel
to
be
a
bit
thin
while
the
abv
cannot
be
tasted
there
just
isnt
enough
going
on
in
this
beer
for
me
to
really
get
excited
about
it
drinkability
solid
dark
ipa
one
of
the
best
i
have
ahd

and
light

with
a

a

that
didnt
last
too
long
nice

started
with
sweet
malty
goodness
with
taste
of
coffee
and
rye
and
ended
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
this
one
is
quite
quaffable
and
id
gladly
visit
this
one
again
ive
never
been
impressed
with
a
tommyknocker
beer
until
now
that
is
hop
strike
is
tommyknockers
dedication
to
the
state
of
alabama
and
its
grassroots
organization
free
the
hops
fth
worked
so
hard
to
rescind
the
beer
restriction
laws
and
continues
to
work
at
getting
al
up
to
speed
legally
with
the
rest
of
the
craft
beer
world
that
tommyknocker
created
their
best
beer
in
honor
of
fths
work
is
very
cool
adark
and
opaque
nice
brown
head
s
not
a
lot
of
aromas
from
this
dark
rye
ipa
t
taste
is
big
on
this
beer
i
love
the
rye
black
mix
perfect
blend
on
malt
hops
and
alcohol
d
very
drinkable
the
7
alcohol
is
extremely
well
hidden
i
can
see
drinking
this
beer
any
time
of
the
year
d
very
drinkable
especailly
with
moderate
abv
the
interaction
of
flavor
and
feel
was
very
pleasant
really
enjoyed
this
one
d
this
was
a
very
nice
rye
beer
i
like
that
they
used
chocolate
rye
and
paired
it
with
the
citrus
hops
the
flavors
played
off
of
each
other
very
nicely
id
like
to
see
this
one
bottled
but
try
it
before
its
gone
i
dig
the
flavor
and
feel
of
this
beer
a
lot
going
on
its
far
from
shy
or
subtle
but
its
short
of
brazenly
excessive
a
little
more
refinement
in
the
sweetness
and
i
could
see
drinking
this
often
especially
with
a
smart
food
pairing
infinitely
drinkable
this
is
one
masterpiece
of
a
rye
ale
wonderfully
balanced
and
delightful
alabamans
are
lucky
to
have
such
a
great
brew
dedicated
to
their
cause
and
i
only
wish
that
this
could
accompany
terrapins
rye
pale
ale
on
local
taps
in
augusta
ga
d
very
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
a
great
combination
of
styles
a
little
rich
to
be
sessionable
thanks
to
tommyknocker
for
dedicating
this
tasty
beer
to
al
i
really
tried
to
like
this
but
it
just
wouldnt
happen
too
bad
too
as
i
have
liked
many
brews
from
brewdog
just
had
some
offputting
flavor
to
me
maybe

old

tnx

here
great
taste
lots

but
rich

ordered
a

came
thought
it
was
the

they
said
it
was

absolutely

were

this
was

i
dont
normally
try

dog
too
often
as
it
is
really
pricey
here
but
this
was
excellent
o
great
brew
i
expect
this
one
came
a
long
way
to
thailand
so
likely
the
hops
have
fallen
off
some
still

it
again

great
beer
for
the
style
almost
got
some
fruity
and
sweet
belgiany
taste
toward
the
end
really
nice
ending
to
a
great
beer
o
surprisingly
good
considering
its
a
month
and
a
half
past
due
libertine
beautifully
integrates
a
massive
pacnw
hop
character
with
classic
porterstout
flavours
worth
buying
o
very
good
mix
of
an
ipa
and
stout
it
brings
out
the
best
of
both
the
brillant
floral
bitterness
with
the
roasted
malts
and
choc
yet
neither
is
too
strong
give
it
a
crack

i
had
this
in

camden
several
times
one
beer
i
would
travel
out
of
my
way
to
find
nice
and
pineyresinous

with
a
touch
of

very

and

the
style

oily
resinous
hops
caramel
faint
smoke
tobacco
leaf
wellbalanced
and
complex
in
flavor
and
character
a
bit
pricey
but
worth
a
try
the
feel
is
good
it
has
an
even
balance
of
sweet
and
dry
and
is
very
bright
lots
of
crispness
without
taking
from
the
smoothness
and
flowing
nicely
on
the
tongue
while
remaining
at
a
solid
medium
body
maybe
a
hair
on
the
lighter
side
of
it
o
the
mouthfeel
and
texture
really
help
to
bring
this
one
together
this
black
ale
manages
to
stay
very
balanced
and
drinkable
which
is
a
challenge
within
the
style
as
the
double
dose
of
bitterness
and
astringency
from
both
hops
and
roasted
malts
often
makes
for
a
rougher
experience
one
of
the
more
cohesive
brew
dog
beers
ive
had
to
date
o
im
really
starting
to
enjoy
black
ipas
and
this
odd
hybrid
goes
down
easy
cheers
to
the
boys
from
scotland
o
pleasant
surpise
and
return
of
fresh
brewdog
shows
they
can
still
make
some
good
beer
surprised
i
had
not
reviewed
before
i
love
this
style
and
brewdog
has
put
their
salty
peaty
roasty
charry
stamp
on
it
this
is
a
favorite
of
the
style
and
a
favorite
beer
i
get
what
this
is
supposed
to
be
but
the
hops
have
faded
assuming
they
were
ever
therebeing
fair
to
the
brewery
some
of
the
extreme
bitterness
remains
but
the
nose
and
taste
are
quite
medicinal
old
licorice
comes
to
mind
though
i
doubt
ive
ever
had
any
ill
give
it
another
shot
and
as
low
as
this
review
is
realize
i
could
go
much
lower
i
lean
towards
the
overall
good
reviews
and
assume
something
is
wrong

took
me
awhile
to
figure
out
what
the
flavors
were
and
it
was
pretty
unique
although
i
havent
had
a
ton
of
black
ales
o
very
easy
drinking
not
at
all
hot
like
many
brewdog
beers
can
be
very
sessionable
very
good
tasting
let
me
preface
this
review
by
saying
this
is
one
of
those
beers
not
for
everyone
if
you
dont
like
hops
or
at
least
these
black
ipas
real
hoppy
and
prefer
a
more
balanced
malty
beer
then
skip
this
pour
a
black
body
with
one
finger
almost
tan
head
that
died
down
leaving
some
lace
the
hops
are
the
star
in
the
aroma
as
i
get
earthy
piney
hops
and
just
touches
of
any
type
of
malt
mostly
sweet
the
beer
is
smooth
light
to
medium
bodied
taste
is
mostly
fresh
earthy
hops
but
the
beer
is
a
little
biggerthicker
than
average
ipa
and
the
malts
do
come
out
as
there
is
a
residual
sweetness
that
hits
me
on
the
backend
to
poorly
summarize
this
beer
its
an
ipa
with
a
larger
chunk
of
bready
and
sweet
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
welcome
more
sweet
black
ipas
like
it
o
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
definitely
done
in
an
american
style
and
isnt
incredibly
complex
but
i
could
definitely
knock
back
a
few
of
these
happily
now
if
only
the
price
could
be
lower
o
a
really
nice
black
ipa
with
a
strong
hops
presence
both
in
smell
and
taste
but
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
definitely
recommendable
and
worth
repeating
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
appearing
nearly
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
fine
two
finger
light
brown
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
thick
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
orange
and
grapefruit
citrus
and
hint
of
tropical
fruit
flavor
is
mixed
citrus
with
citrus
and
grassy
hops
mild
fruit
esters
and
light
toasted
malt
medium
bodied
with
light
creaminess
despite
the
beautiful
head
a
surprising
lack
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
feel
an
interesting
take
on
the
black
ale
style
well
hopped
but
with
a
european
flavor
profile
more
dominated
by
citrus
hops
and
flavor
than
toasted
malt
which
takes
a
third
row
back
seat
im
baffled
by
the
weak
showing
of
the
carbonation
in
the
feel
but
it
was
a
distraction
perhaps
the
carbonation
was
all
used
up
in
the
nice
foam
interesting
but
not
going
to
be
my
goto
black
ale
overall
between
a
good
beer
and
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
amazing
but
different
enough
to
warrant
attention
i
would
definitely
give
this
a
try
and
i
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
brewdog
beers
overall
libertine
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
certainly
needs
a
lot
more
oomph
either
that
or
it
needs
to
be
a
lot
fresher
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
i
just
dont
get
it
pours
into
a
standard
pint
nearly
pitch
black
except
for
some
redish
brown
highlights
when
held
to
the
lighta
thinner
quick
to
fade
beige
head
atop
a
good
burst
of
resinous
hops
in
the
nose
along
with
a
little
grassiness
to
go
along
with
deep
chocolate
notes
piney
hops

out
at
first
sip
along
with
nutty
maltsmore
greenesscomes
into
play
from
the
hops

tonesmalt
driven
sweetness
becomes
bigger
as
i
drink
more
providing
some
molasses
and
caramel
flavors
to
go
along
with
bitter
choccolate
this
is
how
a
aba
should
taste
in
my
mindbig
hops
but
good
dark
malty

job
here
from
the
scottish
guys
pilsner
glass
victoria

pub
columbia
md
the
main
reason
for
the
high
scores
is
the
fact
it
makes
me
want
to
take
another
sip
it
has
a
good
hop
taste
which
i
am
looking
for
and
the
dark
malty
flavors
are
great
for
the
cold
weather
there
is
a
lot
of
good
happening
in
this
beer
and
i
keep
going
back
for
more
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
which
makes
this
in
my
opinion
to
be
a
great
beer
for
someone
just
venturing
into
the
darker
beer
universe
light
body
quite
drinkable
long
and
bitter
aftertaste
even
bitter
root
a
very
strong
beer
with
a
bit
too
much
bitterness
in
the
taste
for
me
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
subtle
earthy
hop
bitterness
countered
by
very
strong
malt
flavors
theres
a
bit
of
earthy
pine
and
resinous
oils
but
like
the
aroma
the
hop
character
is
overpowered
by
the
prominent
malt
bill
slightly
smokey
with
robust
roasted
coffee
bean
flavor
along
with
hints
of
burnt
toast
oatmeal
charcoal
and
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
dry
and
bitter
but
not
harsh
acrid
or
overwhelming
the
bitter
roast
is
cut
midpalate
by
lighter
malt
sweetness
with
hints
of
silky
chocolate
caramel
and
toffee
the
abv
is
well
masked
and
its
light
enough
to
drink
easily
i
just
wish
that
it
had
more
of
a
hop
presence
to
balance
out
the
malt
flavors
it
drinks
more
like
a
slightly
bitter
porter
than
an
american
black
ale
not
bad
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
this
style
o
one
more
good
ale
from
brewdog
overall
the
confusing
flavors
detract
me
from
enjoying
it
fully
i
like
the
complexity
and
feel
as
if
i
had
a
gastronomic
foam
of
carrot
experience
however
i
could
get
this
easily
from
a
solid
belgian
beer
and
would
prefer
to
do
so
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
would
recommend
it
but
i
doubt
i
would
immediately
jump
to
drink
it
again
o
its
a
really
nice
black
ale
but
im
not
sure
id
buy
it
again
given
its
inflated
price
actually
it
isnt
that
hideously
expensive
by
importbrewdog
standards
so
actually
its
more
a
freshness
thing
that
makes
me
hesitate
a
future
purchase
id
definitely
give
it
a
second
chance
on
tap
though
nice
black
colour
with
a
touch
of
red
smell
of
citrusy
hops
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
some
sour
dark
fruits
taste
same
as
smell
bit
of
grapefruit
medium
body
medium
bitterness
touch
of
sourness
id
give
this
beer
5
0
but
im
saving
it
for
perfect
black
ipa
although
its
hard
to
imagine
better
than
this
one
overall
another
winner
from
this
brewer
this
would
be
one
of
my
go
to
beers
if
it
was
available
locally
worth
buying
for
sure
bottle
poured
a
black
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
and
piney
notes
with
light
fruity
touch
is
great
with
some
dry
roasted
malt
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
medium
dry
roasted
malt
notes
with
a
decent
dose
of
simcoe
citrus
and
piney
hops
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
solid
rendition
of
the
style
thought
a
fuller
body
would
have
been
even
better
overall
the
first
black
ale
i
can
really
get
behind
of
it
has
great
complexity
and
drinkibility
value
it
drinks
like
a
session
ale
one
of
my
instant
favourites
from
brewdog
mo
softly
refreshing
on
the
palate
mediumbodied
at
the
same
time
very
smooth
this
black
ipa
or
twenty
first
century
black
ale
has
delivered
a
fairly
satisfying
result
overall
the
alc
content
is
also
well
hidden
increasing
the
drinkability
by
a
very
good
margin
highly
recommended
really
lovely
iba
superb
example
of
the
style
just
artistically
put
together
youve
surprised
me
with
this
one
brewdog
theres
almost
a
subtlety
here
with
the
amount
of
finesse
used
love
it
the
rare
black
ipa
thats
black
more
than
ipa
without
being
a
porter
and
probably
the
best
of
those
a
solid
black
ipa
with
great
aroma
and
flavour
plenty
of
pine
and
hints
of
citrus
along
with
a
large
dose
of
dark
malt
ive
had
this
for
a
while
so
the
hops
may
have
faded
a
little
i
suspect
the
fresh
aroma
was
even
more
intense
my
only
minor
complaint
is
that
the
body
could
be
slightly
thicker
but
this
is
trivial
a
tasty
brew
if
you
like
dark
hoppy
beers
then
seek
this
one
out
worth
sampling
a
really
intense
quite
bitter
black
ipa
if
thats
your
thing
youll
probably
love
this
beer
quite
herbal
and
slick
malt
roastiness
is
slight
a
lot
of
intensity
here
i
quite
like
it
here
strong
rich
and
dark
but
the
intricacies
and
subtle
balance
really
make
it
work
decent
if
not
mindblowing
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
extreme
beer
lots
of
flavors
and
lots
of
hops
making
ends
meet
this
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
colored
beer
with
a
dejection
light
brown
colored
head
the
lacing
and
retention
are
both
pretty
good
here
the
smell
is
really
nice
its
hoppy
and
sweet
smelling
very
impressive
nose
the
taste
is
also
really
nice
hoppy
but
its
also
rich
and
sweet
its
great
in
my
opinion
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
its
almost
creamy
lightly
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
very
good
brew
all
around
i
would
love
having
this
again
o
a
nice
black
ipa
balanced
refreshing
a
decent
black
ale
nice
balance
of
hop
and
roasted
malts
overall
an
excellent
example
of
a
black
ipa
recommended
this
one
was
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
very
much
like
an
ipa
but
not
quite
as
bitter
and
with
a
good
alcohol
content
that
was
well
hidden
but
the
excellent
blend
of
fruits
in
both
the
smell
and
the
taste
wonderful
balance
of
malts
spice
o
an
interesting
beer
complex
but
wellbalanced
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
i
think
its
a
rewarding
beer
one
of
my
favorite
holiday
ales
loses
the
overwhelming
spice
of
others
and
instead
its
hoppy
and
toasty
the
hoppy
smell
explodes
onto
the
scene
and
then
is
followed
by
a
roasted
character
of
coffee
and
chocolate
in
the
very
least
a
roasted
something
the
hops
are
bright
and
add
that
great
citrus
and
bitterness
to
the
mix
i
really
like
this
style
i
would
get
this
again
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
snow
day
is
a
very
deep
brownred
color
with
a
thick
light
mocha
colored
pillowy
head
the
nose
is
a
mixture
of
citrusy
spicy
hops
and
a
toasty
malty
profile
flavor
is
what
you
might
expect
based
on
the
smell
west
coast
hops
grapefruit
and
pine
resin
melded
with
a
roasty
toasty
slightly
nutty
biscuity
malt
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
an
inactive
slightly
creamy
carbonation
overall
definitely
a
beer
i
could
curl
up
with
on
a
cold
winters
night
or
anytime
for
that
matter
good
one
by
nb
o
overall
this
was
probably
the
only
good
beer
that
i
drank
last
night
if
new
belgium
could
fix
the
odd
offputting
watery
flavor
and
up
the
body
this
would
be
a
real
winner
in
a
lot
of
peoples
eyes
a
decent
black
ale
but
i
will
stick
with
others
i
enjoy
more
not
particularly
smooth
but
not
a
rough
beer
to
drink
by
any
means
drying
throughout
watery
feel
with
a
soft
effervescence
you
could
easily
partake
of
several
of
these
without
incident
but
it
isnt
compelling
with
this
weak
body
overall
a
pleasantly
hoppy
black
pa
more
drinkable
than
it
might
be
if
it
were
actually
an
ipa
love
this
beer
really
sad
that
soon
it
wont
be
available
nice
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
hops
up
front
in
the
flavor
as
well
that
give
way
to
the
dark
malts
what
is
that
midnight
wheat
need
to
find
another
beer
with
that
to
help
nail
down
the
flavor
the
body
is
not
heavy
good
mouth
feel
looks
like
a
coke
with
much
smaller
bubbles
nice
lace
for
me
its
a
perfect
balance
just
the
right
amount
of
assertive
hops
and
a
good
combination
the
centennialcascade
and
styrian
goldings
and
dark
malts
finish
is
dry
and
crispy
i
think
i
would
drink
this
in
the
summer
too
never
reviewed
a
beer
before
hope
i
dont
sound
noobish
appearance
is
opaque
black
cola
colored
against
the
light
head
is
decent
in
size
with
small
bubbles
grey
in
color
it
really
looks
like
a
well
carbed
old
ale
lacing
is
good
aroma
has
slight
belgian
malt
sweetness
with
floral
somewhat
grassy
hops
and
some
bakers
chocolate
the
chocolate
comes
through
in
flavor
right
away
slightly
bitter
followed
by
earthy
barkish
metal
the
bitter
hoppiness
is
earthy
as
well
im
guessing
english
hops
such
as
fuggles
are
used
for
bitterness
feel
tends
slightly
toward
watery
and
finishes
dry
i
would
never
put
this
in
the
same
category
as
sublimely
self
righteous
or
other
black
ipas
but
its
definitely
not
a
winter
warmer
considering
its
formidable
use
of
hops
this
reminded
me
a
bit
of
1554
but
a
bit
brighter
id
have
one
again
which
is
good
considering
i
got
a
variety
12
pack
with
three
more
left
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
some
good
winter
flavors
being
mainly
the
evergreen
aroma
and
taste
i
enjoy
this
beer
when
outside
in
the
winter
or
sitting
next
to
a
fire
with
the
christmas
tree
providing
the
ambiance
to
go
with
the
taste
the
body
is
moderate
but
well
carbonated
not
overly
but
does
enhance
the
astringent
characters
overall
more
of
a
different
style
of
beer

as
a

it

back
on

afternoon
with
snow
in

i
was
expecting
something
more
akin
to
a
black

instead
this
is
more
like
a
wellhopped
american
brown
o
this
is
a
decent
black
ale
its
pretty
tasty
but
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
weak
as
in
neither
strongly
malty
or
hoppy
and
not
very
wellblended
the
malty
and
the
hoppy
parts
just
seem
sort
of
separated
nevertheless
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
a
nice
different

beer
our
overall
impression
is
that
its
very

that

again
i
would
never
have
guessed
that
this
was
supposed
to
be
similar
to
an
ipa
as
the
hops
were
relatively
minimal
more
similar
to
a
red
ale
than
a
black
ale
o
overall
another
good
beer
from
new
belgium
a
great
package
of
flavors
with
a
relatively
decent
price
o
pleasant
and
a
good
shot
at
a
hoppy

brownblack
ipa
has
somewhat
of
a
burnt
taste
to
begin
but
after
a
few
more
sips
the
flavour
does
set
it
i
get
the
pine
taste
a
hint
of
bitter
do
not
taste
any
cocoa
flavor
nice
head
poured
into
tall
glass
traps
a
lot
of
smell
in
and
makes
taste
stand
out
very
easy
to
drink
was
not
used
to
the
taste
to
start
but
does
grow
on
you
very
well
a
very
well
done
aba
while
there
are
definitely
more
bold
flavorful
examples
of
the
style
this
has
a
complex
really
enjoyable
flavor
profile
while
still
being
easy
drinking
frist
love
the
picture
on
the
bottle
it
just
sets
up
wat
the
beer
is
all
about
the
beer
is
blackdark
brown
with
ruby
light
through
the
bottem
and
a
nice
foam
white
maybe
off
white
head
the
smell
is
of
hops
and
coco
maybe
fruit
of
some
kind
smells
really
good
the
taste
is
even
better
u
get
the
hops
for
sure
but
not
crazy
u
get
a
little
roasted
choclate
really
kind
of
simple
but
the
beer
just
taste
so
good
the
mouthfeel
is
maybe
the
only
weak
point
of
the
beer
it
has
a
thin
body
with
a
medium
body
on
the
swallow
but
im
not
gonna
fault
this
beer
at
all
for
a
small
thing
to
me
like
mouthfeel
overall
all
this
beer
is
great
i
would
deff
say
try
this
if
u
like
hops
but
like
somthing
a
little
darker
for
the
winter
every
beer
i
have
had
from
there
winter
folly
pack
has
been
awsome
go
get
one
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
probably
overall
its
not
awful
and
its
closer
to
good
than
it
is
to
bad
i
think
black
ales
are
an
acquired
taste
and
feel
and
all
i
can
say
is
im
working
on
it
poured
out
clear
black
with
a
slight
brownish
off
white
frothy
pillowy
head
smells
toasted
with
a
sweat
caramel
aroma
with
some
hops
in
the
background
taste
follows
the
nose
with
more
hops
present
citrus
flavored
but
they
still
follow
the
nice
toasted
flavor
it
drinks
crisp
with
a
medium
soft
pillowy
mouth
feel
this
is
nice
and
refreshing
on
a
cold
winters
day
its
a
little
different
then
the
norm
and
makes
me
think
twice
every
time
i
take
a
sip
lovely
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
so
if
your
in
the
mood
try
one
cheers
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
aroma
sweet
and
citrusy
not
sure
what
this
finishing
hop
is
but
i
like
the
fragrance
alot
dark
clear
garnet
color
fluffy
tan
head
that
sustains
woodsy
pine
bitter
aftertaste
decent
hop
punch
slight
citrus
background
sort
of
a
dry
sweetness
too
smooth
low
carbonation
not
what
i
was
expecting
taste
or
style
wise
quite
good
and
an
interesting
change
of
pace
for
a
winter
seasonal
a
good
beer
i
wasnt
even
sure
of
what
this
style
was
but
thats
okay
i
approached
this
one
with
no
misconceptions
or
prejudices
id
gladly
have
this
again
quite
tasty
nice
complexity
could
be
bigger
in
body
and
flavour
but
a
really
nice
drinkable
winter
ale
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
overall
there
are
some
good
flavors
here
but
at
times
the
combination
almost
gives
a
cough
syrup
kind
of
flavor
including
the
slight
alcohol
warmth
sorta
nyquilish
i
like
alot
of
the
flavors
ive
mentioned
above
but
here
they
dont
seem
to
mesh
all
that
well
try
this
one
for
yourself
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
er
uh
glass
of
beer
a
boatload
of
hops
to
go
along
with
the
chocolate
caramel
malt
flavors
has
a
nice
roasted
taste
and
a
good
balance
overall
good
beer
but
nothing
special
worth
the
8
50
i
paid
for
the
six
pack
to
try
but
dont
think
i
will
be
revisiting
it
anytime
soon
snowday
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
there
was
smokey
malty
aroma
the
taste
had
a
mellow
smokey
malty
backbone
with
hints
of
hops
near
the
end
of
each
sip
good
full
flavor
and
great
to
drink
on
a
winters
night
overall
a
solid
and
enjoyable
good
quality
beer
overall
this
is
very
decent
particularly
for
a
six
pack
one
can
find
at
the
local
711
reminds
me
of
my
nowgone
christmas
tree
not
my
preferred
but
for
the
selection
available
at
the
store
it
was
probably
the
best
pick
not
what
i
expected
from
a
winter
brew
first
taste
caught
me
off
guard
this
beer
at
first
sort
of
seems
like
a
wheat
beer
theres
that
classic
wheat
flavor
and
a
sort
of
earthy
spiciness
the
beer
follows
up
with
a
nice
roasted
caramel
malt
and
even
a
touch
of
a
roasted
flavor
but
the
focus
of
the
beer
is
the
hops
it
drinks
closer
to
ipa
then
anything
a
ton
of
floral
notes
and
a
nice
fresh
citrus
a
really
choppy
aftertaste
and
feel
not
bitter
for
a
hopped
up
beer
i
found
the
feel
to
be
a
tad
thin
and
sort
of
spicy
a
great
winter
beer
that
i
think
is
closest
to
sn
celebration
ale
overall
lives
up
to
its
name
this
robust
brew
is
meant
for
staying
indoors
when
the
snow
is
out
overall
a
good
little
beer
that
in
my
opinion
is
a
few
tweaks
away
from
being
very
very
good
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
color
is
nearly
black
with
almost
no
light
penetration
head
was
about
a
finger
of
beige
with
fairly
nice
lacing
as
it
dissipated
slowly
the
smell
was
not
what
i
expected
very
hoppy
but
lacking
the
maltiness
portrayed
by
the
color
and
head
the
beer
has
a
nice
feel
in
the
mouth
with
a
crisp
hoppy
finish
leaves
a
slightly
flowery
citric
aftertaste
almost
like
grapefruit
the
beer
is
surprisingly
light
and
drinkable
considering
its
dark
color
overall
another
excellent
product
by
new
belgium
tastedark
toasted
wheat
or
malt
citric
piney
hops
subtle
caramel
and
a
soft
underlying
roastiness
that
melds
well
with
the
hops
all
the
wat
to
the
finish
subtle
tasty
and
wellbalanced
good
for
after
snowshoveling
or
just
watching
the
snow
fall
a
nice
surprise
in
a
winter
ale
nice
malty
flavor
with
plenty
of
hop
finish
for
balance
very
drinkable
i
would
like
to
have
seen
a
little
more
body
in
the
head
my
only
complaint
is
the
smell
was
a
little
metallic
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
while
grilling
on
the
deck
on
a
cold
day
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
dark
hue
with
a
big
frothy
head
and
some
nice
lacing
nose
is
roasted
malt
tones
with
nuts
sweet
and
savory
roasted
malt
with
bitter
notes
and
bittersweet
components
enhanced
with
a
bit
of
spice
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
amber
with
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
nice
aroma
of
piney
hops
roasted
malt
somewhat
earthy
with
a
hint
of
holiday
spices
interesting
unexpected
flavor
dominated
by
piney
and
grassy
hops
light
toasted
malt
flavor
is
deceptively
light
but
displays
a
fairly
complex
range
of
herbal
and
grassy
hop
flavors
with
a
light
sweet
malt
base
medium
bodied
with
a
decent
creaminess
this
is
a
different
approach
to
an
winter
ale
leaning
towards
herbal
hop
flavors
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
pours
pitch
black
white
foam
little
bubbles
strong
pine
aroma
tree
like
rich
malt
open
then
a
pleasant
light
layer
of
hops
smooth
finish
the
bittering
contributes
but
in
a
nice
supporting
way
some
coffee
chocolate
malt
taste
very
nicely
balanced
and
behaved
black
ale
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
ales
ive
had
recently
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
lacking
on
characteristics
that
could
otherwise
truly
excite
me
about
it
the
coffeepepper
combo
is
a
neat
twist
on
the
style
but
i
do
wish
it
would
be
thicker
as
i
find
no
characteristic
in
a
beer
more
comforting
worth
a
try
especially
with
the
holidays
up
and
coming
a
snow
day
on
a
day
where
im
literally
staying
home
because
of
a
blizzard
i
find
the
beer
very
enjoyable
the
lightness
and
bitter
flavors
make
it
a
great
sessionable
beer
will
definitely
have
more
often
oa
decent
winter
beer
the
only
real
detraction
is
the
lack
of
balance
o
kind
of
a
unique
brew
smoke
flavor
well
balanced
by
hop
profile
worth
trying
if
you
are
into
those
tastes
it
still
was
not
an
over
the
top
american
style
but
it
was
a
lot
closer
and
the
balance
was
very
nice
i
could
have
had
a
few
but
they
were
a
little
pricey
o
not
bad
at
all
not
quite
as
expected
at
purchase
i
thought
it
would
be
more
of
a
traditional
winter
warmer
after
research
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
hoppier
maybe
it
suffered
from
travelshelf
time
solid
beer
just
doesnt
set
itself
apart
from
the
recent
glut
of
top
tier
black
ales
o
a
good
beer
overall
and
one
of
the
better
winter
seasonals
out
there
it
seems
more
like
a
hoppy
brown
ale
than
black
ale
though
a
nice
beer
to
pick
up
in
cheap
12packs
for
the
winter
good
brew
overall
try
once
overall
its
pretty
good
nothing
that
i
would
say
go
out
and
find
but
one
of
new
belgiums
better
beers
definitely
a
beer
i
would
purchase
again
if
i
can
find
a
fresher
bottle
o
a
pleasant
seasonal
brew
the
ginger
adds
some
holiday
spice
ofor
an
black
ale
its
just
okay
admittedly
its
not
a
style
i
love
but
i
still
appreciate
a
good
one
when
i
experience
it
the
flavors
here
are
all
just
pretty
faint
there
are
no
off
flavors
though
its
at
least
one
of
the
more
drinkable
black
ales
ive
had
its
just
seems
to
lack
really
with
the
dark
flavors
or
the
hops
its
boring
a
black
ale
trying
to
be
an
ipa
im
not
sure
and
darker
than
black
which
doesnt
actually
give
any
idea
of
snow
and
but
looks
like
beer
so
thats
ok
smells
dark
malty
sweet
and
slightly
floral
although
not
nose
forward
thats
for
sure
taste
is
malt
sweet
and
light
but
clear
hops
and
caramel
and
some
chocolate
and
late
coffee
mouthfeel
is
busy
and
foamy
and
creamy
and
really
quite
good
here
i
dont
drink
much
in
the
dark
beer
category
but
this
isnt
too
bad
all
considering
although
at
the
end
i
always
want
a
clear
very
bitter
ale
to
follow
m
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
the
color
when
poured
was
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
reddish
hue
on
the
verge
of
dark
brown
there
was
very
little
foam
but
a
lot
of
lace
of
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
had
the
aroma
of
mild
piney
hops
and
not
much
else
the
taste
and
flavor
was
of
piney
hops
and
nothing
else
that
i
could
taste
this
ale
just
reminded
me
of
another
mild
ipa
not
impressed
with
this
ale
just
a
palate
full
hops
and
bitterness
osmells
rich
and
bold
taste
is
good
but
plain
a
blend
with
other
malts
would
be
better
for
the
body
and
a
balanced
taste
and
finish
its
flat
snpa
with
roasted
malt
sounds
good
but
its
just
not
a
winter
beer
bright
hops
dark
malt
and
wheat
provide
a
twist
to
lighten
it
up
and
theres
not
enough
bitterness
to
judge
it
as
a
black
ipa
this
is
new
belgium
stepping
out
of
its
comfort
zone
daring
but
this
seasonal
missed
the
mark
o
for
the
style
it
feels
like
there
is
too
light
an
amount
of
hop
flavors
enjoyable
but
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
beer
plentiful
floral
hop
notes
though
cascade
is
noted
on
the
label
in
addition
to
other
hops
this
beer
is
pleasantly
free
of
the
sometimes
overpowering
grapefruit
character
that
comes
with
it
the
pleasant
level
of
hop
bitterness
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
richwheaty
malt
character
the
nose
is
probably
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
and
the
taste
has
a
tough
time
keeping
up
with
it
its
pretty
good
but
i
wont
get
a
new
6pack
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
good
beer
and
it
was
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
it
had
very
good
balance
all
the
way
through
that
made
this
beer
not
overwhelming
at
any
end
of
the
spectrum
it
had
decent
drinkability
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
and
the
flavors
held
my
attention
but
one
is
good
for
me
i
dont
really
have
the
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
the
beer
was
the
balance
it
really
highlighted
the
flavor
of
this
beer
and
it
looked
very
good
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
similar
it
was
to
their
red
hoptober
the
malt
base
tasted
pretty
much
the
same
but
this
one
tasted
a
little
less
hoppier
but
it
smells
just
about
the
same
i
would
buy
this
beer
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
but
as
far
as
winter
seasonal
beers
go
i
would
rather
have
sierra
nevada
celebration
i
do
recommend
giving
it
a
try
though
all
in
all
this
beer
was
pretty
solid
with
its
biggest
strength
being
its
balance
good
work
guys
you
sure
know
how
to
make
some
solid
beers
a
nice
beer
for
a
sunny
winter
day
easy
drinking
and
good
bright
and
warm
flavors
o
decent
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
next
winter
there
are
plenty
more
seasonal
releases
from
new
belgium
that
will
end
up
in
my
stock
though
while
roasty
smooth
with
rough
edges
that
have
that
characteristic
wheated
sweetness
it
just
didnt
come
together
unfortunately
the
flavor
collapses
as
it
warms
i
went
from
liking
this
brew
to
disliking
it
to
finding
it
ok
but
its
not
one
id
have
again
o
this
is
a
decent
winter
warmer
selection
but
not
much
bite
or
any
characteristics
that
actually
stand
out
even
with
all
the
different
flavors
it
is
seemingly
one
note
meh
im
one
and
done
with
this
one
o
full
bodied
much
better
than
other
new
belgium
beers
o
the
new
midnight
wheat
ingredient
is
intriguing
if
the
rest
of
new
belgiums
stuff
is
this
good
im
excited
after
earlier
disappointments
with
some
of
new
belgiums
seasonal
ales
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
this
beer
but
it
is
actually
well
crafted
and
a
solid
version
of
the
style
though
the
roastiness
ive
come
to
expect
is
almost
completely
sacrificed
to
make
way
for
the
more
subtle
notes
from
the
hops
which
are
showcased
very
well
ill
admit
maybe
more
of
an
autumn
than
a
winter
ale
but
tasty
nonetheless
t
a
moderate
earthy
hop
bite
upfront
followed
by
some
rye
tasting
malts
and
black
pepper
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
towards
the
end
with
some
earthy
spice
an
interesting
beer
but
probably
not
something
id
do
again
o
new
belgium
just
keeps
getting
better
my
first
experience
with
ranger
and
fat
tire
fell
flat
but
its
been
good
ever
since
then
great
even
this
is
a
lovely
winter
beer
one
i
couldnt
see
myself
getting
tired
of
by
the
end
of
the
sixpack
this
is
dark
and
almost
porterlike
if
youre
a
porter
lover
this
is
a
quality
winter
ale
i
like
it
but
wish
it
were
a
bit
more
robust
either
in
the
sweet
malts
or
the
piney
hops
this
black
ale
poured
beautifully
with
a
nice
stout
head
and
tons
of
lacing
dark
ruby
to
black
it
resembled
a
porter
in
appearance
it
smelled
of
hops
which
was
not
quite
expected
from
the
appearance
but
the
hops
were
slightly
metallic
the
taste
was
subtle
slight
hops
slight
chocolate
malt
but
not
as
robust
as
other
new
belgiums
overall
it
was
nice
but
not
as
good
as
anticipated
poured
this
american
black
ale
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
ale
poured
a
dark
black
color
produced
an
off
white
head
decent
retention
and
left
behind
above
average
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
ale
consisted
of
malted
grain
caramel
and
spicy
hops
medium
in
body
a
foundation
of
toasted
grain
floral
hops
raisin
and
spices
smooth
mouthfeel
finishes
dry
nice
session
beer
wouldnt
mind
having
it
around
on
a
snow
day
overall
a
solid
beer
the
dark
coloring
fools
you
into
thinking
about
the
normal
chocolatecoffee
note
normally
associated
with
a
beer
this
dark
due
to
the
midnight
wheat
these
flavors
are
down
played
while
the
caramel
notes
come
through
the
hops
are
present
but
not
overpowering
this
is
defiantly
not
a
dark
ipa
which
is
a
good
thing
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
this
beer
should
not
be
served
cold
the
flavors
dont
really
come
out
when
it
is
cold
even
though
it
is
for
snow
days
nice
pour
with
a
decent
amount
of
sandy
colored
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
and
leaves
a
thin
film
of
head
and
brussels
lace
up
the
side
of
the
glass
very
malty
aroma
some
floral
notes
from
the
hops
but
not
very
much
root
beer
aroma
some
coffee
from
the
roasting
and
some
grass
from
the
hops
tastes
predominantly
sweet
with
some
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
not
much
definitely
more
of
a
dark
ale
than
a
winter
ipa
like
some
of
the
pac
nw
winter
beers
wellcarbonated
and
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
glad
i
got
a
sixer
of
it
the
body
was
good
for
a
winter
warmer
far
too
full
for
a
cda
drinkability
was
ok
i
didnt
mind
the
beer
while
i
was
having
it
but
it
was
forgotten
as
soon
as
it
was
finished
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
really
one
worth
seeking
out
really
great
brew
i
bet
this
would
be
fantastic
as
a
double
recipe
and
barell
aged
o
a
really
solid
brew
the
hop
character
and
carbonation
add
a
nice
lightness
to
the
heavy
malt
and
dark
fruit
flavors
nothing
like
dedicating
a
beer
to
getting
3
feet
of
snow
fort
collins
2003
37
inches
heres
to
being
snowed
in
and
hopefully
having
enough
beer
to
survive
snow
day
pulls
it
off
with
its
inviting
winter
warmer
toastiness
and
a
slight
warmth
from
the
alcohol
while
this
did
not
strike
me
as
the
usual
holiday
beer
it
was
a
pleasant
one
and
good
enought
to
drink
year
round
maybe
the
mountain
air
of
ft
collins
has
something
to
do
with
it
or
not
o
this
beer
surprised
me
a
past
its
prime
winter
seasonal
seemed
worth
a
try
didnt
realize
it
was
a
hoppy
black
ale
even
with
the
age
the
hops
are
still
refreshing
and
the
overall
impression
comes
through
looking
forward
to
trying
it
fresh
next
winter
notes
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
i
enjoy
it
now
and
then
but
i
never
really
search
them
out
decent
but
there
are
just
points
where
i
dont
think
all
the
flavors
meld
well
the
fruity
hops
just
dont
come
out
as
much
in
the
taste
this
is
a
delicious
winter
beer
perfectly
balanced
i
wish
this
was
a
year
round
serving
this
is
a
good
brew
it
has
strong
hop
cone
flavor
it
is
fairly
malty
too
poured
a
very
nice
black
color
with
a
bit
of
nice
head
and
a
bit
of
nice
lacing
throughout
nice
deep
roasted
malt
scents
and
a
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
bitter
slightcitrus
hop
finish
at
the
end
goes
down
quite
smoothly
a
nice
roasty
winter
ale
to
keep
you
warm
black
ales
are
the
new
winter
ales
hey
you
know
i
can
deal
with
that
love
the
nose
on
this
one
flavor
is
bringing
the
black
ale
characteristics
but
in
what
i
would
genuinely
have
to
classify
as
a
mass
produced
kind
of
way
but
that
doesnt
really
matter
this
is
something
you
could
drink
and
enjoy
en
masse
or
just
to
try
it
i
wouldnt
mind
a
few
more
of
these
o
the
great
fresh
nw
coast
hops
are
big
and
dark
but
this
beer
is
still
very
sessionable
even
at
over
6
o
really
good
winter
ale
but
more
like
a
mild
black
ipa
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
the
flavor
disappoints
mildly
it
is
a
fine
beer
but
not
my
favorite
the
hops
are
piny
and
earthy
with
an
odd
finish
oh
well
it
is
fine
but
not
my
thing
despite
the
somewhat
harsh
burn
i
liked
this
beer
its
tasty
and
very
aromatic
4

overall
just
something
not
right
about
the
taste
that
kind
of
ruins
it
for
me
still
a
very
good
beer
just
needs
some
tinkering
to
be
excellent
cheers
to
illudium
for
the
sample
overall
a
strange
winter
ale
with
hops
being
the
primary
focus
the
hopmalt
combination
is
an
odd
one
almost
polar
opposites
in
a
way
with
bright
citrus
hoppiness
intermixed
with
roasty
malt
flavorings
its
interesting
to
say
the
least
even
if
it
doesnt
necessarily
makes
it
case
into
great
beer
territory
very
interresting
taste
and
the
beer
grows
on
you
as
more
you
drink
o
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
aba
to
drink
for
a
whole
evening
drink
overall
its
almost
past
its
expiration
but
still
nice
and
creamy
with
some
roasty
chocolate
and
more
malty
notes
dont
really
get
the
wheat
base
a
very
easy
drinking
black
american
pale
ale
i
would
quaff
this
on
the
beach
at
abasin
during
a
break
from
skiing
an
enjoyable
seasonal
release
from
my
friends
at
new
belgium
not
a
bad
beer
i
believe
this
is
the
first
new
belgium
beer
ive
ever
had
and
have
been
told
it
is
one
of
the
better
ones
so
im
glad
that
i
got
a
good
start
on
it
o
big
on
flavours
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
big
hop
presence
in
a
winter
ale
everything
works
well
here
too
bad
i
cant
get
this
on
the
reg
o
a
very
good
american
black
ale
call
it
the
little
brother
to
yakima
glory
and
youre
on
the
right
track
single
finger
head
with
tons
of
lace
on
a
clear
very
deep
amber
body
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
surprisingly
so
witha
light
roasted
malt
background
strong
musty
and
earthy
hop
flavor
roasted
malt
and
light
coffee
notes
as
well
medium
to
full
body
and
moderate
carbonation
one
of
the
hopper
and
darker
winter
ales
i
have
had
almost
light
a
light
thin
black
ipa
d
a
very
solid
american
black
ale
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
would
drink
this
again
without
hesitation
a
very
nice
new
belgium
offering
o
very
flavorful
nice
hop
character
o
a
twist
on
the
standard
hoppy
american
ale
with
the
light
roast
character
adding
some
depth
appropriate
for
a
winter
seasonal
this
is
a
winner
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
ill
definitely
look
forward
to
it
returning
deep
dark
brown
with
a
nice
beige
head
aroma
is
pine
and
citrus
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
an
herbal
note
flavor
is
chocolate
grainy
malt
sweet
dark
caramel
some
interesting
grainy
roast
notes
citrus
planty
and
spicy
hops
palate
is
light
to
medium
bodied
a
nice
winter
brew
easy
drinking
despite
the
alcohol
that
warms
the
belly
against
the
cold
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
replacement
for
2
below
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
have
to
put
it
in
the
rotation
for
the
upcoming
fall
overall
i
guess
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
dont
know
what
makes
it
specifically
winter
here
a
pretty
easy
drinking
darker
ale
in
my
opinion
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
delivery
bit
of
caramel
and
chocolate
up
front
and
with
a
moderate
feel
finishing
with
some
hop
spice
but
without
any
real
bitterness
rather
light
on
the
palate
for
a
black
ipa
but
then
i
find
it
more
balanced
than
most
of
the
ilk
hoppy
enough
in
the
aroma
but
not
overly
bitter
and
yet
not
too
malty
either
making
for
a
quaffable
drink
winter
seasonals
are
not
my
favourite
of
the
seasonal
varietals
so
i
wont
let
that
bias
me
too
much
this
is
a
well
made
beer
i
would
say
its
better
as
a
winter
seasonal
than
as
a
black
ale
in
my
imaginings
of
the
respective
categories
anyway
certainly
check
it
out
if
you
like
winter
brews
or
if
it
happens
to
be
cheap
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
frothy
tan
head
on
it
that
lasts
a
little
while
and
leaves
some
lacing
the
nose
is
good
some
roasted
coffee
and
chocolate
malts
maybe
some
piney
hops
also
the
taste
is
good
some
roasted
coffee
chocolate
and
caramel
balanced
with
some
piney
hops
no
real
sweetness
and
just
a
bit
bitter
pretty
decent
winter
beer
d
between
a
brown
ale
an
aba
this
is
a
nice
addition
to
the
nb
seasonal
lineup
difficult
to
categorize
but
tasty
on
cold
nights
overall
this
is
not
a
particularly
warming
beer
despite
the
reasonable
abv
i
think
that
they
couldve
safely
pushed
the
abv
even
up
to
9
or
so
without
doing
any
harm
to
the
characteristics
of
the
beer
sipping
it
further
the
hops
start
to
dominate
a
bit
so
perhaps
the
malt
couldve
been
left
a
bit
more
room
to
breathe
anyway
its
an
interesting
enough
take
on
a
winter
ale
with
clear
influences
both
from
belgium
and
the
hopfriendly
us
brewing
scene
this
beer
is
a
bit
stronger
than
i
expected
because
it
drinks
so
light
and
quaffable
it
reminds
me
of
a
little
black
ipa
so
really
a
black
pale
ale
though
really
it
reminds
me
of
a
hoppy
porter
it
sort
of
reminds
me
of
avery
new
world
porter
though
this
isnt
quite
as
roasted
as
that
beer
the
burnt
note
that
this
beer
has
seems
quite
distinct
compared
to
what
is
usually
found
in
a
roasted
beer
and
it
has
me
wondering
if
the
distinctness
is
because
this
beers
roast
character
comes
from
the
roasted
midnight
wheat
not
a
bad
beer
i
think
i
prefer
2
below
winter
ale
quite
a
bit
more
than
this
one
though
snow
day
has
the
roast
and
hop
character
clashing
enough
in
the
finish
to
add
a
touch
of
harshness
and
this
is
accentuated
a
bit
by
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
dnot
a
bad
representation
of
the
style
i
think
i
just
dont
love
this
style
smooth
oily
and
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
bittersweet
roasty
finish
at
6
2
abv
it
doesnt
take
much
to
feel
warm
and
fuzzy
while
sipping
this
beer
overall
it
looks
and
smells
better
than
it
tastes
to
me
still
a
very
solid
beer
with
an
interesting
mix
of
light
body
hops
and
a
roasty
finish
doesnt
pack
quite
the
punch
of
flavor
i
would
like
at
6
2
abv
this
is
a
big
heavy
beer
and
just
tastes
great
i
enjoyed
this
i
would
have
liked
to
have
ultimately
felt
a
bit
more
of
a
malt
presence
in
the
aroma
despite
how
much
i
liked
those
hops
in
the
nose
but
this
was
well
balanced
flavorwise
and
the
easygoing
body
just
added
to
my
overall
enjoyment
of
this
im
not
sure
that
i
would
automatically
associate
black
ales
with
a
wintertime
seasonal
but
it
had
enough
of
a
dark
roasty
presence
to
keep
this
in
line
with
cold
temperature
drinking
doa
bottled
on
date
mar
25
12
d
not
a
bad
winter
ale
little
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
not
my
favorite
from
new
belgium
but
not
bad
d
a
bit
of
a
mutt
in
terms
of
style
but
its
an
enjoyable
beer
that
brings
a
little
of
everything
to
the
table
a
pleasant
drinking
winter
seasonal
from
new
belgium
another
nice
experimental
ale
from
a
good
brewery
though
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
american
black
ale
style
ill
have
to
try
a
few
others
before
i
pass
judgement
on
the
style
d
this
was
a
nice
hoppy
beer
with
great
grapefruit
character
in
the
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
good
too
and
the
alcohol
wasnt
noticeable
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
not
a
revolutionary
brew
but
it
was
fully
enjoyable
and
a
good
change
of
pace
from
most
holiday
beers
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
pours
like
cola
smells
of
caramel
roasted
malts
and
some
hops
toffee
roasted
malts
some
spice
and
hops
are
on
the
palate
very
session
able
dark
ale
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
solid
one
this
beer
was
a
nice
experience
and
im
going
to
seek
out
different
brands
that
produce
the
black
ale
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
style
this
would
fit
into
the
best
as
it
kind
of
takes
on
characteristics
of
several
styles
whatever
you
classify
it
as
i
find
it
to
be
quite
nice
and
supremely
drinkable
thanks
to
john
my
brother
in
law
for
the
sample
overall
eh
not
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
guess
and
the
fact
good
is
gone
guess
i
will
be
rating
more
stuff
average
which
is
what
this
is
really
an
average
brew
not
something
i
would
choose
to
be
snowed
in
with
give
me
a
big
brew
for
the
snow
up
until
tonight
i
thought
the
concept
of
an
american
black
was
weird
and
awkward
too
much
one
way
or
the
other
and
you
get
just
awkward
my
few
bad
experiences
with
this
style
reinforced
that
opinion
i
honestly
think
this
is
what
the
style
was
meant
to
be
new
belgium
has
achieved
the
tricky
balance
that
this
style
requires
i
will
definitely
be
getting
this
again
in
two
years
n
b
rotates
their
seasonals
every
other
year
overall
a
good
offering
from
new
belgium
will
probably
pick
it
up
next
season
o
this
is
not
much
of
a
winter
warmer
as
the
label
seems
to
indicate
but
it
is
a
decent
black
ale
it
looks
great
smells
ok
tastes
delicious
to
someone
who
enjoys
hops
and
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
despite
being
on
the
thin
side
o
certainly
a
beer
i
enjoy
the
finish
was
something
i
didnt
expect
but
this
was
a
welcome
surprise
o
a
nice
hoppy
black
ale
and
quite
perfect
on
a
frigid
evening
worth
picking
up
ooverall
this
is
like
most
winter
days
in
oregon
dreary
the
worst
of
style
i
have
had
made
worse
by
the
presence
of
wheat
malt
d
not
a
year
round
beer
by
any
chance
but
a
welcome
friend
on
these
cold
south
carolina
nights
the
winter
seasonal
from
new
belgium
and
i
absolutely
love
this
beer
bought
a
12
pack
for
about
13
99
pours
a
jet
black
with
a
slightly
reddish
tinge
to
it
nice
fluffy
white
head
taste
is
medium
bodied
malts
hit
you
upfront
some
caramel
and
smokiness
followed
by
a
nick
smack
of
hops
on
the
finish
pretty
complex
flavors
but
it
goes
together
well
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
and
makes
for
a
great
winter
beer
highly
recommended
snow
day
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
amazing
winter
ales
this
beer
can
be
described
as
a
black
ipa
it
has
a
dark
characteristics
similar
to
a
stout
but
nowhere
near
the
thickness
the
head
to
this
brew
is
a
nice
off
white
color
it
floats
lightly
on
top
and
makes
for
an
amazing
lacing
due
to
the
lacin
you
can
see
every
sip
you
take
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
beer
brings
forth
tastes
of
coffee
with
an
ipa
hoppy
slap
to
the
face
at
the
end
delicious
and
the
winter
flavors
are
almost
perfectly
balanced
with
the
hops
in
the
after
taste
o
ok
but
a
bit
too
toasted
for
me
strange
comboblend
fruity
citrusy
aroma
definitely
had
that
hops
bitter
bite
to
it
but
pretty
mild
overall
average
mouth
feel
i
just
had
widmers
brrr
a
week
before
this
and
i
thought
of
snow
day
as
a
milder
not
quite
as
good
brrr
me
i
just
like
it
this
6pack
went
down
with
no
problem
ill
probably
do
some
more
before
its
gone
but
it
wont
make
me
miss
the
snow
overall
a
solid
black
ipa
but
not
exceptional
clean
dry
nice
malt
presence
with
a
noticeably
hoppy
finish
probably
gonna
be
revisiting
this
poured
this
brew
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
my
tulip
glass
a
dense
foamy
head
exudes
hops
cocoa
and
spices
the
first
sip
is
a
huge
surprise
as
it
tastes
like
a
combination
of
a
brown
ipa
mixed
with
an
old
style
black
ale
of
all
of
the
winter
warmers
ive
tried
this
would
have
to
be
my
favorite
the
smell
and
taste
alone
vault
this
beer
into
the
above
average
category
and
the
added
touches
of
spicy
carbonation
and
a
noninvasive
head
push
it
even
higher
in
my
book
i
reserve
my
5
star
ratings
for
the
best
of
the
best
quality
quads
trippels
and
imperial
stouts
but
as
far
as
ordinary
beer
goes
this
is
a
real
winner
i
prefer
my
winter
beer
to
have
more
malt
but
i
like
it
a
very
drinkable
winter
ale
i
would
have
this
again
and
i
hope
itis
around
next
winter
as
well
pours
out
an
impressive
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
tan
head
there
was
something
on
the
bottle
about
midnight
wheat
malts
i
have
to
say
it
looks
pretty
cool
anyway
big
bold
hoppy
smell
with
a
hint
of
sweet
toasty
malts
also
getting
some
big
coriander
like
smells
i
believe
from
some
of
the
those
hops
almost
a
peppery
corianderlike
smell
but
not
in
a
white
ale
sort
of
of
way
its
weird
i
have
smelled
it
in
other
hoppy
beers
is
it
the
goldings
anyway
the
taste
is
actually
pretty
toasty
at
first
some
faint
dark
chocolate
taste
followed
up
with
a
citric
hop
twang
and
some
of
those
spicey
coriander
style
hops
i
mean
maybe
it
is
their
strain
of
yeast
they
do
call
themselves
new
belgium
brewing
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
carbonated
and
not
extremely
smooth
i
have
had
other
beers
i
would
put
in
the
american
black
ale
category
but
this
one
reminds
me
more
of
a
dark
hoppy
wheat
beer
overall
a
nice
brew
and
i
will
try
to
grab
another
six
pack
this
season
flavorful

interesting

this
american
black
ale
is
tasty
as
a
winter
warmer
and
even
better
on
a
cold
snowy
day
very
enjoyable
a
light
and
hoppy
dark
beer
that
is
pretty
well
balanced
excellent
for
drinking
a
few
in
the
winter
im
usually
not
too
crazy
about
extremely
roasty
beers
so
this
was
perfect
for
me
pours
a
dark
brown
that
looks
almost
black
when
not
held
up
to
the
light
head
is
off
white
thick
and
leaves
lots
of
lacing
nose
is
deceptively
full
of
hops
taste
is
grassy
and
citrusy
hops
up
front
with
a
prevalent
roasty
and
chocolaty
backbone
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
one
would
think
but
fits
the
style
ironically
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
hoppy
but
decided
to
go
with
a
seasonal
since
theres
a
limited
window
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
i
had
gotten
the
best
of
both
worlds
notes
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
im
a
bit
ambivalent
about
my
overall
impression
its
kind
of
watery
but
i
found
myself
quaffing
this
with
continued
interest
its
bitter
but
malty
flavors
seem
almost
nonexistent
its
certainly
worth
a
try
who
knows
you
might
find
yourself
wondering
and
drinking
and
wondering
some
more
o
good
winter
ale
this
one
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hophead
or
for
someone
that
is
building
up
their
hop
palate
great
balance
of
flavors
and
very
enjoyable
onice
flavors
come
through
with
a
smell
that
changes
over
time
leading
to
a
little
complexity
in
this
that
i
didnt
expect
but
its
solid
and
given
its
decent
abv
more
than
likely
a
fine
warming
beer
on
those
snowy
days
i
doubt
id
ever
turn
one
down
having
grown
up
in
las
vegas
and
phoenix
ive
never
experienced
a
snow
day
but
thisll
do
just
fine
a
bold
hoppy
dark
ale
thats
almost
roasty
enough
to
be
a
black
ipa
o
very
impressive
tastes
like
chewing
on
fresh
hops
props
to
new
belgium
for
a
nice
holiday
surprise
note
i
dont
find
any
2
below
this
year
i
pray
this
is
not
the
replacment
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
nice
take
on
a
style
that
is
difficult
to
find
and
a
nice
changeofpace
from
the
other
winter
beers
very
enjoyable

here
definitely

on

making
the

overall
this
is

i
was
hoping
for
more
roasted

presence
in
the
taste
i
would
have
this
again
d
a
solid
offering
from
nbb
and
one
that
pleasantly
surprised
me
good
session
brew
wasnt
sure
to
expect
with
this
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
very
tasty
and
a
welcome
addition
to
my
usual
winter
time
brews
d
color
me
impressed
with
this
one
for
its
smooth
drinkability
mellow
richness
and
subtle
festive
spice
this
would
be
a
great
6er
to
drink
on
christmas
day
overall
very
intriguing
brewdifferent
looking
and
different
tasting
than
one
would
have
suspected
overall
i
could
see
where
this
might
be
easily
disliked
or
easily
admired
i
lean
strongly
toward
the
latter
just
for
the
fact
that
ive
been
running
into
this
style
a
lot
as
of
late
and
this
one
rubs
me
the
right
way
for
some
reason
it
has
that
drink
me
by
the
fire
and
watch
some
bowl
games
aura
to
it
ok
i
will
then
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
a
black
ale
well
balanced
yet
has
some
exceptional
complexity
no
coffee
flavors
but
i
can
pick
up
some
roasted
malt
flavors
thick
head
dark
red
slight
bitter
taste
with
a
hoppy
after
taste
find
it
has
a
piney
smell
a
little
burn
but
over
all
desert
winter
beer
half
way
thru
my
beer
the
head
was
still
present
after
taste
is
bitter
in
the
mouth
smooth
yet
dry
its
a
cold
night
here
so
it
went
well
with
dinner
the
caramel
hint
has
a
unique
catch
while
sitting
back
i
am
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
blackcascadianamerican
black
ales
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
but
i
approach
them
with
an
open
mind
the
aroma
of
this
brew
fails
in
all
departments
whether
you
consider
it
a
winter
alewarmer
or
a
black
ale
the
nose
is
quite
unpleasant
and
unfitting
of
any
style
of
beer
the
taste
is
somewhat
fitting
for
the
black
ale
style
but
doesnt
fully
come
together
for
me
this
brew
is
medium
to
light
bodied
favoring
a
bit
to
the
medium
side
and
it
has
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
fairly
well
integrated
but
overall
this
is
not
something
i
would
enjoy
having
more
than
a
sample
of
heath
i
appreciate
of
the
opportunity
to
try
this
but
it
just
wasnt
for
me
overall
3

a
decent
black
ipa
when
i
was
expecting
a
winter
warmer
spicy
enough
to
be
mistaken
for
a
warmer
if
it
werent
for
the
resinous
hops
a
decent
winter
beer
but
thats
not
a

overall
a

cda
but
not

edit
tempted
to
up
the
overall
score
to

5
but
i
wont
due
to
a
lack
of
winter
spices
not
too
into
spiced
brews
unless
theyre
tasty
belgians
or
something
worth
adding
an
extra
dimension
to
very
nice
job
o
easy
drinker
a
very
nice
winter
warmer
pours
a
very
dark
amber
color
with
a
big
cloudy
head
that
lingers
and
laces
quite
well
the
aroma
is
strong
with
roasted
malt
and
light
chocolate
and
toffee
hints
taste
is
ok
but
surprisingly
bland
with
the
stronger
aroma
one
would
think
that
the
flavor
would
be
more
pronounced
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
overall
its
a
fine
beer
overall
a
nice
surprise
overall
not
something
i
will
buy
again
though
i
am
a
fan
of
new
belgium
brewing
good
smelling
and
great
tasting
interesting
in
the
best
way
combination
of
bright
hops
and
then
sudden
malt
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
smooth
overall
not
too
bad
taste
is
piney
hops
followed
buy
some
dark
malt
and
coffee
flavors
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
as
well
however
still
get
an
overwhelming
taste
of
tea
with
high
tannins
very
bizarre
first
smell
cant
really
even
describe
it
under
a
halfinch
head
hard
to
distinguish
which
hop
actually
smellstastes
okay
very
strange
mixture
it
does
taste
better
than
it
originally
smells
i
will
give
it
that
otherwise
happy
i
purchased
this
with
a
mixer
pack
and
will
not
get
any
more
heavy
side
of
light
this
drinks
easy
nothing
offensive
or
amazing
like
many
a
new
belgium
brew
so
not
terribly
interesting
and
a
bit
thin
but
worth
trying
glad
i
tried
on
draft
have
been
testing
the
new
belgium
lineup
now
that
it
is
available
in
va
the
dense
flavors
makes
this
one
to
sip
and
enjoy
over
the
holidays
a
black
ale
for
snow
day
ironic
yes
but
boy
this
is
good
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
it
does
not
stack
up
all
that
well
compared
to
others
in
its
style
however
there
are
several
other
beers
in
this
category
that
i
find
to
be
much
more
complex
and
rich
although
i
like
this
beer
i
think
it
could
be
much
more
rich
and
a
little
bit
less
watery
texture
is
nicely
smooth
and
creamy
but
also
feels
slightly
undercarbonated
not
a
bad
black
ale
but
i
still
prefer
black
top
over
this
one
any
day
why
because
this
brew
doesnt
really
come
across
as
memorable
or
distinctive
its
just
not
complex
enough
to
impress
nor
is
it
simple
enough
to
sell
the
minimalism
approach
so
i
end
up
with
mediocrity
pours
dark
chocolate
brown
with
thick
offwhite
to
tan
colored
head
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
smooth
mild
roasted
malts
offering
hints
of
caramel
and
chocolate
mixing
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
and
planty
piney
hops
a
smooth
flavor
of
chocolate
roast
malts
with
sweet
caramel
and
a
touch
of
grapefruit
bitterness
ends
with
a
hint
of
some
darker
roast
malts
leaving
a
nice
aftertaste
of
dark
chocolate
and
bread
medium
body
with
a
chewy
and
silky
mouthfeel
this
one
hits
pretty
well
above
its
weight
with
complexity
and
a
good
punch
of
flavor
o
screw
the
hot
chocolate
give
me
some
snow
day
winter
warmer
its
not
this
american
black
ale
features
great
hop
and
roasted
malt
balance
with
a
clean
hop
finish
that
begs
for
another
sip
and
a
day
off
with
5
more
bottles
in
the
fridge
taste
is
bigger
on
the
flavoring
hops
than
the
bittering
and
they
seem
to
meld
nicely
into
a
moderate
malty
middle
and
is
finished
off
by
a
clean
snap
of
roasty
wheat
and
zesty
hop
bite
i
really
like
this
one
it
first
i
was
sad
to
see
that
was
replacing
i
think
2below
which
i
looked
forward
to
every
winter
but
snow
day
is
as
fine
a
replacement
as
i
could
ask
for
im
on
my
second
sixer
already
dr
quite
drinkable
but
also
unremarkable
id
try
it
ondraught
its
pleasant
but
theyd
do
well
to
increase
the
impact
of
the
toasted
malt
not
necessarily
a
bad
brew
for
those
cold
winter
nights
but
definitely
not
the
first
one
id
turn
to
with
a
creamier
body
and
a
heavier
flavor
this
would
be
a
really
good
one
for
shame
m
medium
body
with
mild
but
smooth
carbonation
looks
good
smells
amazing
but
the
taste
is
very
underwhelming
the
end
flavor
is
good
but
its
a
watery
mess
up
front
hops
are
really
really
nice
however
an
almost
rich
body
and
taste
without
a
lot
of
definition
which
leaves
to
the
conclusion
that
its
very
drinkable
but
why
if
im
going
to
drink
a
full
bodied
heavy
beer
i
would
like
to
have
some
richer
tastes
jh
the
smell
was
the
best
part
to
this
beer
maybe
the
surprising
good
smell
made
me
want
to
like
it
that
much
more
but
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
makes
me
think
of
sierra
nevada
celebration
only
the
nb
is
better
with
the
less
intense
hops
that
give
you
a
chance
to
enjoy
the
rich
dark
flavors
one
of
their
better
efforts
if
you
like
the
hoppiness
o
not
bad
sort
of
a
mix
of
a
winter
warmer
and
a
black
ipa
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
o
not
bad
but
not
really
anything
to
write
home
about
but
its
out
there
for
malt
lovers
out
there
not
sure
what
to
think
of
this
beer
not
really
to
style
but
not
bad
overall
i
think
i
still
like
their
previous
winter
seasonal
2
degree
better
d
while
i
loved
their
previous
winter
seasonal
two
below
snow
day
is
a
very
worthy
successor
overall
excellent
beer
with
generous
hops
perfect
cold
weather
beer
tastes
exactly
as
you
would
exspect
it
would
from
the
look
and
smell
this
style
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
more
spectacular
ipas
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
the
drinkability
is
high
for
the
season
im
beginning
to
fall
for
the
winter
warmers
overall
a
brew
with
lots
of
malty
pine
flavor
if
they
were
going
for
a
beer
that
tasted
like
a
christmas
tree
they
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
its
worth
a
try
and
i
see
the
potential
for
good
stuff
out
if
the
roasted
wheat
but
probably
not
going
to
be
a
winter
staple
for
me
o
not
bad
overall
for
a
winter
warmer
it
might
be
rather
tart
but
i
liked
it
overall
i
hate
this
compared
to
2
below
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
nice
brew
but
dont
fix
whats
not
broken
very
drinkable
well
balanced
very
tasty
i
would
drink
this
any
time
of
year
i
like
dark
hoppy
brews
this
time
of
year
new
belgiums
snow
day
is
a
nice
addition
to
that
landscape
props
to
new
belgium
for
creating
another
tasty
winter
offering
o
i
expected
more
malt
character
in
the
flavor
profile
but
it
just
wasnt
there
in
fact
the
drown
out
citrusy
and
tart
hop
flavors
seemed
to
throw
it
out
of
balance
and
mask
the
soft
malts
the
aroma
was
great
to
me
very
inviting
and
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
as
well
the
flavor
could
use
some
balancing
to
me
though
overall
i
think
its
still
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
again
any
time
soon
d
overall
not
bad
it
could
use
more
hop
flavor
and
a
deeper
malt
body
its
a
unique
and
fun
drink
for
the
holidays
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
smokey
taste
but
not
too
much
not
enough
carbination
i
know
thats
how
its
supposed
to
be
but
i
still
wish
it
had
more
tastes
better
when
its
not
so
cold
wish
those
dallas
cowboys
could
do
better
the
texas
rangers
didnt
do
their
part
overall
not
bad
not
great
probably
a
one
sixpack
a
year
affair
o
an
interesting
mix
between
an
ipa
and
a
winter
warmer
its
not
quite
a
black
ipa
like
some
have
said
but
its
a
much
better
beer
than
most
winter
seasonals
oan
interesting
beerid
consider
it
to
be
more
of
a
black
ipa
than
a
winter
warmer
to
me
the
hops
dominant
and
gives
an
unbalanced
taste
i
like
the
nice
fresh
hop
aroma
and
taste
but
i
tend
to
prefer
a
beer
more
on
the
maltysweet
side
vs
hoppy
overall
a
great
new
hoppy
winter
beer
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
not
have
guessed
its
a
winter
warmer
seems
more
like
a
wimpy
black
ale
nice
enough
to
try
but
i
wouldnt
be
inclined
to
buy
it
again
o
the
hop
profile
of
this
beer
works
really
well
with
the
midnight
wheat
i
was
a
huge
fan
of
2
below
but
this
beer
has
won
me
over
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimson
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
chocolate
herbalcitrus
zest
hops
and
some
subtle
spice
aromas
taste
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
powder
earthy
spices
and
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hops
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
winter
warmer
but
it
seems
like
it
could
be
integrated
a
bit
better
with
the
different
flavors
quite
a
few
beers
get
jumbled
in
the
winter
warmer
category
but
this
beer
deserves
the
designation
deep
roasted
malt
notes
with
hints
of
chocolate
malt
nicely
assertive
hopping
akin
to
perhaps
a
double
brown
ale
if
there
is
such
a
thing
finish
is
malty
competing
for
attention
against
the
bittering
echo
served
with
a
nice
light
tan
thick
foamy
slightly
frothy
head
that
slowly
settled
out
and
lots
o
lace
color
is
a
clear
garnet
aroma
is
hop
malt
roast
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
plus
toffee
bare
sweetness
and
some
carbonic
tang
body
is
good
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
decent
a
little
short
balanced
easy
to
have
another
o
i
thoroughly
enjoy
new
belgium
beer
and
this
one
is
no
exception
a
very
good
winter
beer
that
i
will
definately
drink
again
o
enjoyable
but
not
sure
ill
buy
this
one
again
bordering
on
black
ipa
o
not
outstanding
but
still
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
like
hoppy
black
ales
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
although
a
full
six
pack
might
be
a
little
much
for
one
setting
overall
winter
warmer
lives
up
to
the
hype
and
gives
a
satisfying
taste
lacked
on
the
foam
for
me
perhaps
it
was
just
a
bad
pour
on
my
part
it
was
smooth
and
then
it
was
bitter
and
then
it
was
smooth
again
complex
thick
and
warming
perfect
companion
on
a
cold
winter
night
fairly
disappointing
winter
beer
from
new
belgium
honestly
much
closer
to
a
black
ipa
and
not
a
particularly
good
one
at
that
overall
a
very
good
winter
beer
d
another
decent
offering
from
nb
but
thats
all
it
is
o
a
really
nice
winter
offering
from
new
belgium
i
would
gladly
recommend
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
64
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
hint
of
spice
slight
earthy
malt
hint
of
floralgrass
fits
the
style
of
an
american
black
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
earthy
malt
floralgrass
hops
and
slight

overall
good
appearance
and
feel
body
and

are

the
floralgrass
aspect
pours
near
black
with
a
decent
head
and
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
carries
some
good
american
hops
along
with
a
bit
of
roast
flavor
is
roast
with
a
bit
of
resin
and
bitterness
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
semidry
roasty
finish
pretty
good
take
on
the
style
but
nothing
too
fantastic
o
not
a
bad
winter
ale
but
not
my
favorite
full
bodied
but
easy
to
drink
on
a
cold
evening
why
rush
it
with
a
great
beer
anyways
plenty
strong
and
very
tasty
to
get
you
warmed
up
from
the
weather
i
will
look
for
this
ale
every
fall
pretty
good
o
i
think
the
name
certainly
describes
this
beer
it
tastes
like
snowfall
in
a
pine
forest
the
clean
finish
makes
it
feel
crisp
and
easy
drinking
quite
enjoyable
although
i
could
perceive
others
as
describing
it
as
watered
down
its
got
enough
hoppiness
for
hopheads
to
be
satisfied
as
well
as
enough
complexity
in
the
malt
bill
to
satisfy
stout
and
porter
drinkers
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
one
and
welcome
it
to
any
snow
days
we
might
have
in
the
future
good
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
11
mar
12
this
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
foamy
tan
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
hops
floral
and
pine
mostly
ipa
like
the
feel
is
medium
and
the
taste
is
full
of
a
bitter
hop
bite
which
coats
the
mouth
and
leaves
a
bitterness
on
the
way
down
it
also
has
a
nice
roasted
malt
yet
almost
sweet
taste
in
the
middle
good
stuff
one
of
the
better
new
belgium
beers
o
big
hops
profile
could
have
used
a
bit
more
balanced
still
it
tastes
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
its
funny
to
have
a
beer
where
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
so
different
you
get
hops
in
your
face
in
the
aroma
and
heavy
on
the
crisp
malty
side
in
the
flavor
a
very
enjoyable
brew
and
an
excellent
winter
brew
this
beer
again
shows
that
new
belgium
just
cant
make
a
bad
beer
roasted
hoppy
and
crisp
this
beer
personifies
a
cozy
winter
day
by
the
fire
enjoy
this
might
be
my
new
favorite
black
ipa
really
makes
me
want
to
get
some
midnight
wheat
to
try
out
at
home
for
what
it
is
this
is
fine
to
me
its
not
really
a
winter
beer
worth
trying
this
is
basically
a
solid
apa
mixed
with
a
solid
warmer
great
seasonal
session
overall
a
very
solid
black
ale
hops
are
vibrant
and
the
dark
malts
provide
some
nice
toasty
flavor
overall
its
bitter
who
cares
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
as
there
are
better
winter
beers
to
start
off
i
do
not
believe
this
should
be
considered
a
winter
ale
it
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
to
me
but
do
not
let
this
discourage
you
winter
ale
lovers
it
pours
a
very
dark
brown
almost
black
with
nice
amber
tones
it
has
a
nice
cream
colored
light
head
very
atypical
of
a
dark
beer
and
contrasts
beautifully
it
smells
of
fresh
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
carbonation
is
balanced
if
you
like
ipas
or
even
pale
ales
go
for
one
of
these
babies
overall
honestly
an
odd
beer
not
my
favorite
black
ale
o
dont
know
if
this
is
a
black
ale
or
a
hopped
brown
ale
tough
to
judge
the
category
either
way
its
an
enjoyable
beer
that
makes
a
great
beer
for
the
winter
months
so
glad
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
nice
warm
surprise
for
me
this
should
be
called
a
winter
ipa
its
a
nice
twist
of
styles
o
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
if
i
had
known
this
was
a
black
ipa
i
would
have
purchased
this
sooner
will
buy
again
o
interesting
beer
from
nb
ill
probably
drink
the
rest
of
the
6er
without
much
trouble
but
i
would
like
a
bit
more
body
and
a
bit
more
malt
depth
to
help
it
out
its
by
no
means
a
hop
onslaught
and
insanely
one
dimensional
its
just
watered
down
is
all
if
they
keep
this
around
for
next
year
i
hope
they
make
it
a
little
thicker
and
a
little
richer
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
think
that
i
would
get
it
again
12
oz

glass
quickly
dissapating
head
but
reasonable
lacing
pours
a
root
beer
color
subtle
pine
and
grapefruit
aroma
with
caramel
and
slight
chocolate
taste
of
dark
malts
and
citrus
hop
blend
with
very
subtle
spice
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
light
side
but
nice
dry
finish
overall
im
pleased
with
this
one
its
like
a
black
ale
session
beer
not
outstanding
but
certainly
not
offensive
i
could
imagine
taking
this
to
a
christmas
party
and
enjoying
it
over
a
long
evening
the
seal
brown
colored
body
was
nearly
opaque
and
the
head
atop
was
two
fingers
thick
the
aroma
was
a
mix
of
well
toasted
malts
and
citric
hops
the
taste
provided
flavors
of
anise
pumpernickel
bread
and
light
toffee
the
taste
was
bit
less
flavorful
than
i
had
hoped
it
would
be
the
body
was
light
to
medium
dense
and
the
finish
astringent
and
abrupt
this
beer
started
out
very
well
but
didnt
quite
deliver
what
it
promised
medium
creamy
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
good
not
great
decent
beer
i
do
fear
nb
is
getting
a
bit
away
from
their
original
belgian
tilt
but
this
is
a
decent
winter
beer
certainly
more
interesting
than
the
2
below
which
was
little
more
than
a
strong
fat
tire
nicely
made
and
flavorful
works
for
me
as
a
winter
warmer
due
to
the
significant
alcohol
warming
of
the
pleasant
variety
i
get
as
it
goes
down
bring
home
a
growler
of
this
ale
its
going
great
with
sunday
football
i
think
i
need
some
some
super
nachos
to
go
with
it
maybe
even
some
hot
wings
big
offwhite
head
on
black
coffee
with
bubbles
dry
ever
so
slightly
toasted
malt
backdrop
and
leafy
hop
flavor
with
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
nose
almost
a
chewy
mouthfeel
but
a
touch
too
watery
solid
winter
beer
with
a
neat
hop
thing
going
on
easy
and
worth
getting
again
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
new
belgium
is
a
very
respectable
brewery
but
i
do
feel
like
their
six
packs
are
mainly
average
at
best
this
was
a
solid
black
ipa
in
my
opinion
and
more
than
likely
will
be
taking
up
so
real
estate
in
my
fridge
through
out
the
colder
months
i
kind
of
expected
a
winter
warmer
so
i
was
surprised
to
try
it
and
find
out
is
was
a
hoppy
black
ale
not
a
bad
beer
and
super
easy
to
drink
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
no
regrets
here
i
would
drink
this
while
listening
to
some
electronic
music
some
mellow
post
rock
experimental
stuff
like
bill
laswell
radiohead
mogwai
or
one
of
my
favorites
the
cd
init
ding
by
microstoria
mostly
relaxin
for
a
snow
day
a
good
beer
as
it
stands
and
a
surprisingly
good
beer
from
the
folks
at
new
belgium
this
is
in
now
way
a
winter
warmer
its
way
too
hoppy
and
i
like
hoppy
beers
big
disappointment
by
all
aspects
for
me
i
have
the
remaining
5
beers
i
cant
drink
during
my
tenure
at
purdue
we
got
one
snow
day
despite
ridiculous
and
possibly
recordbreaking
snowfall
my
one
year
at
georgetown
on
the
other
hand
saw
nearly
two
weeks
of
snow
days
thanks
to
snowmageddon
none
of
this
is
relevant
just
thought
it
interesting
anyway
this
beer
pours
a
clear
dark
rubybrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
glowing
offgrey
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
mandarin
orange
flesh
light
vinyl
very
light
roasted
malts
pine
sap
and
light
lemon
rind
the
taste
holds
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
vinyl
is
gone
replaced
by
a
touch
more
roast
than
before
the
orange
is
more
prominent
but
doesnt
stand
too
far
out
from
the
darkness
behind
it
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
pretty
dern
solid
cda
still
cant
bring
myself
to
use
the
term
black
ale
one
that
drinks
very
easily
and
stands
up
there
amongst
the
top
tier
examples
of
the
style
i
like
new
belgium
but
this
is
a
miss
for
me
it
lacks
in
complexity
and
really
doesnt
have
much
of
an
identity
at
all
one
and
done
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
do
not
really
like
the
blend
of
dark
malts
with
so
much
hops
beautiful
hop
aroma
foamy
white
head
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
smells
of
piney
hops
taste
is
medium
mouthfeel
not
heavy
good
cascade
hop
flavor
and
caramelchocolate
flavor
no
roast
no
burnt
acrid
taste
very
nice
beer
when
you
drink
it
expect
an
american
black
pale
ale
made
with
low
lovibond
crystal
malts
maybe
a
little
chocolate
malt
and
mediumhigh
level
of
american
cascadecentenialor
columbus
hops
overall
this
beer
seemed
onedimensional
and
not
very
interesting
not
one
id
likely
buy
again
first
had
this
beer
on
draft
and
at
first
it
almost
reminded
me
of
arrogant
bastard
but
i
had
several
beers
before
hand
and
i
think
that
skewed
my
thought
it
seems
to
have
the
same
biscuit
backbone
that
fat
tire
has
although
this
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
and
way
more
darker
i
do
get
a
malt
nose
also
overall
i
really
dig
this
beer
and
am
sure
i
will
but
several
more
six
pack
to
get
me
through
some
of
the
long
cold
snow
days
here
in
montana
overall
a
nice
slightly
mellow
black
ipa
o
this
is
the
first
beer
in
quite
some
time
ive
purchased
and
consumed
over
and
over
i
like
it
i
was
bummed
they
decided
to
postpone
brewing
of
2
below
for
a
few
years
but
this
is
very
good
i
will
definately
enjoy
this
again
and
again
this
holiday
season
i
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
tap
like
everything
new
belgium
does
this
is
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
its
counterparts
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
brownred
with
almost
no
head
bottle
might
be
different
smells
woody
boozy
hoppy
smokey
a
sort
of
tart
wine
like
vibe
in
the
begining
turns
into
a
pleasant
chocolate
hops
fusion
with
a
nice
winter
warmer
type
sweet
slow
strong
finish
the
mouth
feel
is
bizarre
not
being
very
carbonated
but
kind
of
heavy
makes
it
a
weird
one
to
drink
a
lot
of
again
at
least
on
tap
overall
it
isnt
my
favority
new
belgium
offering
but
as
usual
i
appreciate
their
take
on
the
style
overall
this
is
not
what
i
expect
from
a
winter
ale
the
hop
presence
is
overpowering
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
darkchocolate
brown
with
a
fairly
thick
and
persistent
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
malty
aroma
has
sweet
chocolate
and
subtle
spicy
notes
just
a
hint
of
molasses
flavor
has
a
malty
core
with
woody
semisweet
chocolate
caramel
and
molasses
notes
smooth
texture
is
just
a
teensy
thin
but
still
good
and
quite
tingly
finish
is
woody
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
caramel
drinkability
it
is
a
nice
brew
but
i
think
it
is
a
little
overhopped
for
the
holiday
season
i
prefer
my
holiday
spice
to
be
holiday
spice
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
hops
are
present
but
the
malt
is
so
unique
it
almost
feels
like
a
porter
this
beer
is
way
too
easy
to
drink
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
winter
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
enjoy
the
easiness
of
drinking
this
beer
and
how
smooth
it
goes
down
cant
beat
that
for
how
cheap
it
is
not
a
fan
of
this
it
seems
like
they
were
going
for
a
sweet
black
ipa
but
the
flavor
and
feel
are
a
bit
off
to
a
friend
with
a
limited
beer
budget
i
would
suggest
they
pass
this
up
however
this
is
nonetheless
quite
good
and
well
worth
enjoying
new
belgium
has
done
a
fine
job
of
rounding
out
its
base
into
new

2
below
and
now
snow
day
o
a
solid
beer
i
like
it
a
bit
better
than
2
below
why
they
suggest
to
serve
this
at
37f
is
beyond
me
take
my
advice
dont
a
new
enjoyable
winter
seasonal
o
the
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
work
other
than
that
with
is
a
very
good
beer
you
get
a
good
amount
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
and
some
awesome
toasted
malts
as
well
just
an
all
around
good
beer
nothing
mind
blowing
but
everything
is
present
an
well
accounted
for
o
i
prefer
2
below
to
this
it
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
not
the
best
balance
or
drinkability
snow
day
is
a
nice
beer
overall
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
winter
warmer
all
that
much
but
im
glad
i
grabbed
a
sixer
o
when
the
housewife
in
front
of
me
at
the
market
grabbed
a
sixer
of
this
i
should
have
known
better
quite
note
what
i
expected
but
still
very
palatable
and
actually
enjoyable
once
i
threw
my
expectations
aside
for
that
hoppy
spicy
redalmostcelebrationtypeale
i
find
it
enjoyable
and
while
not
one
i
will
seek
out
one
i
would
drink
again
for
sure
this
beer
pours
a
clear
brown
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
caramel
and
grapefruit
with
a
hint
of
pine
resin
there
is
a
very
significant
hoppiness
to
the
aroma
the
taste
has
a
similar
hoppiness
but
with
a
more
pronounced
maltiness
there
are
toffee
and
caramel
notes
underneath
the
grapefruity
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
watery
texture
and
annoyingly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
pass
on
next
time
the
hop
and
malt
really
clash
with
each
other
in
a
negative
way
o
solid
beer
in
my
opinion
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
one
finger
clingy
light
beige
colored
head
that
really
stuck
like
glue
as
it
settled
very
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
chocolate
malts
and
piney
hops
in
the
nosea
nice
mix
a
little
fizzy
in
the
mouthoutside
of
that
little
sharpness
it
was
oklight
to
medium
feel
quite
dry
on
the
palate
with
unsweetened
chocolate
and
some
earthy
notesthe
piney
hops
come
into
the
finish
along
with
a
tinge
of
sourness
wich
i
dont
really
know
where
it
came
fromthat
light
sour
bite
kept
the
taste
score
down
a
little
for
me
its
not
your
typical
winter
ale
wich
is
good
and
it
has
a
nice
hop
biteits
missing
a
biggermore
smooth
feeland
the
sour
shot
i
got
i
didnt
care
forin
saying
that
its
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
gee
it
looks
like
everyones
having
trouble
categorizing
this
one
im
seeing
suggestions
of
black
ipa
dunkel
winter
warmer
and
even
dark
wheat
me
id
lean
more
towards
black
ipa
though
even
in
that
category
its
not
as
hardhitting
as
others
in
that
grouping
but
itd
be
one
of
the
more
easydrinking
o
great
winter
warmer
new
belgium
always
treats
me
right
and
this
hoppy
but
gentle
darker
beer
doesnt
change
that
not
the
classic
winter
warmer
but
a
nice
beer
on
a
cool
night
the
6
2
alcohol
is
actually
wellhidden
because
i
could
drink
several
of
these
o
this
is
a
really
good
brew
it
really
tasted
more
like
a
black
ipa
than
a
winter
warmer
o
eh
an
ok
beer
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
esb
winter
seasonal
either
but
like
it
this
is
ok
but
nothing
too
special
the
best
quality
of
this
beer
is
it
fills
you
up
but
the
complexity
promised
from
the
bottles
label
left
me
wanting
more
not
a
bad
beer
id
drink
it
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
this
isnt
a
beer
id
anticipate
every
winter
mouthfeel
isnt
rich
or
full
but
it
isnt
turning
anything
about
this
off
d
drinks
rather
smoothly
and
nicely
defiantly
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonals
now
id
love
to
see
two
bomber
releases
jump
from
snow
day
first
an
imperial
black
ipa
with
both
the
hops
and
abv
dialed
up
second
a
traditional
brown
focused
on
that
new
midnight
wheat
perhaps
unfiltered
with
low
alphaacid
hops
new
belgium
snow
day
winter
ale
at
a
work
social
function
there
was
a
good
selection
of
bottled
beer
for
the
sampling
i
chose
a
new
belgium
snow
day
looking
forward
to
something
new
and
it
was
an
entirely
different
experience
i
did
not
expect
the
nearly
black
color
and
thin
off
white
head
this
beer
has
the
look
of
a
black
ale
rather
than
that
of
a
winter
warmer
great
aromas
come
off
of
this
brew
lots
of
malty
sweet
smell
and
a
big
dose
of
coffee
was
it
the
look
that
made
me
smell
the
coffee
a
roasty
malt
flavor
greets
you
on
the
first
sip
and
there
is
some
subtle
bitterness
to
the
finish
the
snow
day
has
a
big
body
to
it
very
good
special
or
dessert
beer
you
will
not
down
a
six
of
these
in
an
evening
pours
a
very
dark
brown
w
a
soapy
one
finger
cocoa
head
excellent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
snifter
glass
very
dark
impossible
to
see
anything
when
held
to
the
light
nose
is
mainly
piney
hops
wheat
and
slight
bit
of
malt
very
crisp
and
refreshing
smelling
brew
the
taste
is
interesting
its
very
crisp
and
the
hops
are
definitely
out
front
malt
makes
its
way
into
the
picture
in
the
aftertaste
but
not
much
of
it
there
this
beer
almost
makes
me
pucker
the
way
eating
a
lemon
does
its
not
bad
just
not
as
balanced
as
id
like
feel
is
carbonatedfizzy
and
light
for
what
id
expect
very
dry
as
well
overall
this
is
an
interesting
brew
but
not
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
there
are
better
winter
beers
out
there
cheers
snow
day
isnt
a
classic
winter
warmer
its
not
heavy
or
rich
enough
but
it
sure
is
enjoyable
tasty
and
juicy
more
suited
to
after
a
coldweather
activity
or
during
a
spicy
meal
than
as
an
after
dinner
or
late
evening
sipper
i
poured
into
a
small
glass
and
was
surprised
by
the
dark
color
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
had
a
dark
ruby
red
note
to
the
blackness
the
head
was
thin
with
creme
color
and
light
lacing
the
aromas
was
nice
and
hoppy
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
new
belgiums
hoptober
ale
but
still
strong
a
nice
subtle
caramel
malt
note
crept
in
behind
the
hops
the
taste
started
off
as
citrus
and
pine
from
the
hops
and
faded
to
the
caramel
of
the
roasted
malt
in
the
after
taste
the
feel
was
full
of
carbonation
and
tickled
the
palate
overall
this
was
a
better
balanced
beer
than
hoptober
the
roasted
wheat
malt
made
more
of
a
nice
compliment
to
the
hops
while
the
use
of
only
three
hops
versus
five
in
hoptober
didnt
over
whelm
the
malt
new
belgium
did
good
on
this
beer
overall
this
is
my
first
winter
warmer
brew
and
i
loved
it
for
me
its
a
rather
odd
brew
it
looks
like
a
traditional
stout
beer
but
its
actually
got
the
flavor
like
an
ipa
with
some
characteristics
of
a
stout
beer
namely
the
burnt
caramel
and
malt
flavor
new
belgium
is
known
for
making
solid
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
pick
this
up
if
its
available
in
your
area
my
neighbor
brought
over
a
snow
day
from
new
belgium
it
was
quite
tasty
the
beer
poured
a
deep
rich
clear
brown
into
my
pint
glass
the
offwhite
head
was
big
at
the
start
and
about
a
12
finger
at
the
end
and
laced
throughout
the
drink
the
smell
included
hops
and
roast
with
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
the
first
few
sips
of
the
beer
the
malt
roast
caramel
and
slight
coffee
grounds
were
present
as
i
continued
to
drink
the
beer
the
centinnial
hops
on
the
front
and
casscade
on
the
back
began
to
take
over
the
mouthfeel
was
great
medium
body
and
decent
carbonation
overall
a
great
beer
pours
a
cola
brown
with
generous
creamysilky
smooth
head
very
appetizing
appearance
nose
has
a
toasted
pine
quality
with
some
holiday
spice
candy
in
the
background
palate
offers
a
rather
assertive
and
playful
mixture
of
caramel
with
the
fruity
hops
with
yet
again
more
toasty
pine
high
tingly
carbonation
is
noted
finishes
with
a
toasted
to
maybe
burnt
sugary
pine
as
well
i
like
this
good
character
and
refreshing
i
would
classify
it
as
a
black
ipa
but
it
works
well
as
a
winter
warmer
also
if
you
like
hops
you
will
probably
like
this
o
the
snow
day
winter
ale
may
be
my
favorite
beer
from
new
belgium
not
to
repeat
others
but
its
really
a
black
ipa
not
a
winter
warmer
its
tasty
and
very
hop
forward
while
it
is
very
dark
the
malts
manage
to
stay
in
the
background
and
provide
a
nice
counter
to
the
hop
forwardness
of
the
beer
highly
recommended
and
i
hope
the
snow
day
becomes
an
annual
tradition
o
this
is
a
pretty
sweat
little
beer
but
i
dont
think
its
a
winter
warmer
nothing
extreme
but
hitting
all
the
right
notes
and
lots
of
pretty
lace
nice
job
new
belgium
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
the
hoppiness
mixed
pretty
well
with
the
toasty
sweet
caramel
malts
a
pretty
drinkable
and
flavorful
beer
of
the
season
overall
i
dont
feel
like
this
is
a
winter
warmer
at
all
and
is
definitely
a
black
ipa
or
american
black
ale
or
whatever
its
called
approaching
this
beer
with
that
in
mind
i
think
its
an
average
beer
for
the
style
while
nothing
extraordinairy
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
easy
to
appreciate
effort
from
new
belgium
overall
this
is
a
great
changeup
from
new
belgium
o
a
drinkable
winter
warmer
but
a
couple
will
do
it
for
me
many
better
and
tasty
ww
out
there
overall
obviously
winter
warmer
is
not
really
the
appropriate
description
this
is
a
nice
black
ipa
american
black
ale
that
could
use
a
titch
more
flavor
and
body
otherwise
quite
enjoyable
and
better
than
2
below
o
ah
winter
seasonal
beers
are
here
again
it
is
time
to
spend
a
lot
of
my
money
i
have
never
had
this
before
and
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
bottle
sadly
this
was
not
the
best
winter
beer
to
begin
with
if
i
were
to
grade
this
beer
simply
by
how
it
tastes
it
would
be
an
average
to
decent
black
ipa
however
i
am
supposed
to
review
it
to
the
style
it
claims
to
be
and
in
that
this
beer
has
failed
while
the
appearance
has
a
nice
head
and
deeper
color
the
aroma
is
consumed
by
hops
the
flavor
of
the
beer
tastes
like
a
black
ipa
not
a
winter
warmer
the
mouthfeel
is
not
heavy
enough
and
the
warmth
from
the
alcohol
is
not
really
there
the
flavor
profile
is
missing
the
malt
fruit
and
sweetness
of
a
winter
warmer
it
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
winter
warmer
look
somewhere
else
o
mix
between
a
pale
ale
lager
dark
wheat
does
anyone
else
find
it
annoying
that
a
seasonal
has
no
correlation
to
the
season
its
sold
in
not
bad
overall
but
probably
wont
purchase
again
pours
a
dark
opaque
brown
team
head
with
good
lacing
smells
of
bread
dough
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
good
carbonation
on
the
palate
taste
is
where
it
loses
me
shoe
leather
leaves
earthy
some
strange
herbs
that
im
not
sure
how
to
describe
not
very
hoppy
for
a
black
ipa
pine
and
bitter
citrus
peel
spruce
fir
or
other
coniferous
descriptor
flash
of
bittersweet
cocoa
dark
roast
in
the
background
to
compliment
smooth
and
fairly
light
bodied
medium
level
of
carbonation
spices
nope
hops
yes
definitely
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
lingers
around
nicely
a
pint
or
two
would
be
no
problem
o
a
nice
winter
offering
from
new
belgium
the
heavy
dose
of
hops
is
rather
refreshing
for
a
winter
brew
it
doesnt
come
off
as
especially
heavy
or
sweet
but
still
fits
in
well
as
a
coldweather
beer
would
recommend
poured
an
almost
blackdark
brown
with
one
finger
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
died
slow
w
lace
patches
in
top
of
a
slightly
floral
hop
aroma
with
muted
spices
and
malts
i
think
i
would
consider
this
more
of
alright
ipa
than
a
winter
warmer
as
that
balance
of
sweet
and
roasted
malts
and
spices
is
usurped
by
a
earthy
hop
presence
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
and
has
some
balance
and
finishes
with
a
somewhat
spicy
edge
but
overall
the
hops
are
too
strong
for
my
liking
for
this
style
overall
impression
will
definitely
be
enjoying
more
of
this
all
fallwinter
would
suggest
you
get
yourself
a
single
bottle
or
6pack
of
this
too
not
sure
about
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
yet
but
could
definitely
be
changing
this
review
the
next
time
i
get
this
beer
my
first
winter
warmer
this
season
enjoy
the
first
winter
release
for
me
this
year
like
most
new
belgium
products
easy
to
drink
and
simple
maybe
not
something
i
will
reach
for
all
the
time
but
certainly
enjoyable
overall
another
decent
beer
from
new
belgium
not
their
best
offering
but
good
nonetheless
o
good
tasting
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
want
my
2
below
its
a
pretty
little
beer
this
and
my
favorite
new
belgium
seasonal
so
far
it
does
occupy
a
place
between
an
ipa
or
strong
apa
and
a
black
ipa
the
hops
please
so
many
of
us
and
it
fits
the
season
with
some
comforting
interesting
malt
notes
taste
is
complex
beginning
with
a
mild
roasty
malt
followed
by
a
subtle
citruspine
bite
in
the
middle
the
finish
brought
a
slightly
bitter
hops
character
though
by
no
means
a
hop
bomb
balanced
well
this
enjoyable
ale
really
impressed
me
pours
nice
amber
color
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
like
an
apa
the
body
is
lacking
for
a
winter
warmer
good
value
beer
though
above
average
with
a
nice
hoppy
zing
another
beer
worth
buying
from
new
belgium
just
wish
it
had
a
little
more
oomph
and
body
to
it
o
not
bad
but
i
have
had
better
the
feel
of
the
beer
is
the
best
part
i
might
pick
it
up
again
but
i
drinking
it
reminds
me
of
fat
tire
with
how
underwhelmed
i
am
by
this
beer
overall
though
this
is
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
at
all
where
is
the
warming
malt
body
on
this
sounds
like
they
went
for
hop
heads
not
what
i
want
in
a
winter
warmer
i
need
my
spices
sweetness
and
my
malt
not
a
hop
blast
i
am
going
to
pass
on
this
one
edit
someone
had
updated
the
notes
on
this
from
winter
warmer
to
black
ale
since
i
wrote
this
review
which
makes
more
sense
now
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
healthy
retaining
head
leaving
nice
lace
smell
has
a
big
hit
of
fresh
hops
with
malt
in
the
background
taste
again
has
that
big
hit
of
hops
that
pulls
thoughout
leaving
the
malt
in
the
background
making
it
more
of
a
winter
ipa
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
for
the
style
but
has
good
carbonation
not
bad
needs
to
be
more
balanced
with
malt
to
bring
out
more
flavor
and
body
overall
mild
and
not
overly
spiced
drink
this
and
expect
an
oatmeal
stout
and
you
will
be
happy
overall
a
good
beer
but
i
prefer
2
below
to
this
beer
although
its
a
nice
medium
bodied
dark
beer
from
new
belgium
tastes
are
underwhelming
but
the
smell
is
great
very
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
thick
creamy
offwhite
head
that
leaves
behind
plentiful
lace
as
it
recedes
spicy
herbal
oily
hop
greenness
over
pine
berries
and
a
whiff
of
dark
coffee
piney
hops
upfront
pale
fruit
and
a
bit
of
char
lightly
sweet
through
the
middle
before
succumbing
to
the
dark
bitterness
theres
more
of
a
perception
of
roastiness
than
an
outright
malty
flavor
element
if
i
had
to
categorize
id
call
this
more
of
an
amber
though
a
dark
and
hoppy
one
at
that
regardless
i
enjoyed
this
one
even
though
theres
nothing
particularly
wintery
about
it
pours
cola
brown
with
a
fluffy
light
tan
head
get
some
serious
hop
notes
on
the
nose
roasted
malts
come
through
with
an
assertive
hop
kick
on
the
finish
similar
to
arrogant
bastard
but
far
less
aggressive
flavorful
but
not
overwhelming
better
than
2
below
overall
a
great
little
brew
this
is
an
unexpected
winter
warmer
its
far
hoppier
than
i
had
anticipated
the
label
boasts
dark
caramel
midnight
wheat
as
the
malt
base
it
gives
a
surprisingly
solid
malt
base
that
meshes
well
with
the
immense
hops
pours
to
a
thick
rocky
buff
head
and
very
good
lacing
mahogany
color
and
brilliant
clarity
aroma
is
of
spicy
and
piney
hops
and
hints
of
caramel
and
citrus
flavor
is
a
funky
mixture
of
spicy
hops
dill
pine
straw
black
malt
and
harsh
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
overall
i
was
impressed
by
the
distinctive
aroma
and
the
inviting
appearance
the
flavor
was
just
weird
to
me
and
it
felt
too
dry
and
chalky
ill
try
it
again
later
and
rereview
just
in
case
my
palate
was
off
which
does
happen
depending
on
what
i
ate
or
how
much
gum
i
chewed
during
the
day
it
has
got
to
be
better
than
this
this
is
my
idea
of
a
winter
alewinter
warmer
nicely
balanced
malt
and
hops
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
decent
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
along
with
a
gorgeous
deep
ruby
color
the
hops
predominate
without
muscling
the
malt
character
aside
its
in
the
ballpark
of
sierra
nevada
celebration
and
rogue
santas
little
helper
good
stuff
this
would
be
a
daytime
snow
day
beer
for
me
especially
if
i
was
having
beef
fajitas
upper
end
of
lightlower
end
of
medium
bodied
the
carbonation
is
medium
and
fits
the
beer
well
very
nice
mouthfeel
its
pretty
easy
to
drink
as
well
i
like
this
newbie
from
new
belgium
my
new
favorite
session
beer
id
categorize
this
as
more
of
an
ipadark
wheat
hybrid
the
only
tie
it
has
to
the
winter
warmer
style
is
that
its
a
winter
seasonal
nb
has
really
been
surprising
me
lately
i
was
starting
to
put
them
behind
in
the
interesting
beers
race
yet
everything
ive
tried
recently
is
nice
and
impressive
o
what
can
i
say
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
of
the
few
winter
seasonals
ive
had
so
far
this
is
far
and
away
my
favorite
i
do
have
to
say
that
i
enjoy
this
more
than
i
recall
enjoying
the
two
below
not
that
it
was
bad
at
all
i
didnt
realized
how
hoppy
this
brew
was
going
to
be
when
i
purchased
it
if
i
had
known
i
might
have
shied
away
but
im
glad
i
didnt
i
nice
hoppy
beer
hit
the
spot
on
a
cool
late
fall
day
o
a
very
good
brew
from
nb
hopefully
theyre
able
to
continue
down
this
path
this
is
definitely
not
a
winter
warmer
recommended
the
hops
dominate
the
aftertaste
but
its
ok
its
not
annoying
i
rather
like
it
overall
i
enjoyed
the
every
process
of
drinking
this
winter
seasonal
beer
by
new
belgium
from
the
pour
to
the
last
sip
i
bought
a
variety
of
the
winter
beers
that
just
arrived
on
the
shelves
and
this
was
by
far
the
most
unique
and
pleasurable
to
drink
i
cant
wait
to
get
another
six
pack
come
the
first
snow
fall
feels
medium
in
body
briskly
carbonated
and
actually
wetting
to
the
palate
not
a
bad
go
to
winter
warmer
a
fine
winter
warmer
and
a
big
departure
from
two
below
could
be
classified
as
a
black
ipa
from
bottle
dated
12715
second
tasting
of
a
mbc
beer
this
is
a
black
ipa
and
the
bottle
should
state
it
that
way
it
was
described
to
me
as
such
before
purchase
dark
pour
with
a
thicker
viscosity
2
finger
tab
foam
laced
and
held
the
glass
throughout
very
nice
caramelly
smoky
hop
smell
a
piney
hop
flavor
hits
the
mouth
up
front
and
the
rich
malt
settles
in
the
back
followed
by
a
little
bitter
bite
a
few
seconds
later
the
rich
woody
malt
flavor
lingers
overall
a
very
good
not
great
offering
for
a
dark
ipa
would
purchase
again
without
a
doubt
but
want
to
try
the
other
maine
beers
first
on
draft
similar
to
other
black
ipas
hoppy
and
bitter
didnt
care
for
it
very
dry
not
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
just
sort
of
there
ok
now
ive
read
others
reviews
nobody
else
got
oak
closest
was
smoky
maybe
thats
a
better
description
my
second
offering
from
mbc
looks
pretty
nice
frothy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
dark
and
roasty
with
a
nice
hop
bite
paired
with
a
couple
leadbelly
tracks
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
caught
a
whiff
of
yeast
in
the
beginning
pours
dark
with
a
moderate
head
tastes
ok
i
enjoyed
it
not
good
taste
too
dark
tasty
great
for
a
dark
ale
some
interesting
hop
aromas
going
on
clean
finish
but
loses
a
bit
of
flavor
at
the
end
solid
beer
but
not
mbcs
best
my
instant
impression
was
that
of
a
brown
ale
and
not
having
a
clue
to
this
beers
makeup
when
i
cracked
the
top
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
saw
its
rich
dark
composition
when
first
gazing
upon
its
black
body
and
creamy
frothy
head
i
thought
how
nice
a
black
ale
which
wasnt
to
far
off
it
goes
down
like
combination
of
a
hazelnut
brown
ale
and
a
traditional
black
ale
so
it
gives
you
the
best
of
both
worlds
its
yet
another
example
of
how
mbc
has
staked
its
claim
as
one
of
new
englands
best
brewers
high
c
o
great
black
ale
i
could
see
this
working
really
well
as
a
black
ipa
if
it
was
a
bit
hoppier
man
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
ever
had
this
beer
is
so
onpoint
it
really
is
every
thing
a
black
ipa
should
be
a
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
im
really
happy
to
have
found
this
on
my
recent
trip
to
the
east
coast
keep
up
the
great
work
mbc
overall
not
a
bad
attempt
at
a
very
difficult
genre
the
black
ipa
is
all
about
balance
where
as
with
this
beer
its
almost
split
dark
in
the
beginning
ipa
in
the
end
not
bad
but
wouldnt
buy
again
o
nice
black
ipa
three
full
fingers
worth
medium
brown
colored
head
that
is
both
crisp
and
airy
while
being
comprised
of
lots
of
big
chunky
bubbles
and
a
rocky
top
rock
solid
retention
the
color
walks
a
fine
line
between
dark
brown
and
flat
black
largely
still
with
just
a
stray
carbonation
bubble
or
two
seen
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nice
is
quite
whimsical
equal
parts
piney
and
juicy
hop
resins
there
are
some
faint
roasted
malt
tones
beneath
the
surface
just
the
slightest
whiff
of
vanilla
as
well
the
nose
was
a
good
indication
of
what
to
expect
on
the
palate
there
is
no
vanilla
sweetness
but
everything
else
is
spot
on
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
ebb
and
flow
while
competing
for
prominence
the
mouth
feel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
a
slightly
surprising
bite
of
prickly
carbonation
a
touch
of
dryness
throughout
before
finishing
with
a
bit
of
a
chalky
presence
loaded
with
character
maine
brewing
turns
out
another
winner
with
weez
a
very
well
rounded
american
black
ale
iwth
lots
of
depth
and
complexity
a
terrific
brew
all
the
way
around
nice
and
roasty
mild
grassy
and
pine
hop
character
aroma
is
a
little
weak
but
an
excellent
black
ipa
i
dont
think
maine
brewing
can
do
no
wrong
first
off
just
left
maine
brewery
this
beer
was
bottle
7
days
ago
i
did
not
get
to
try
it
on
draft
but
purchased
a
bottle
it
smells
deliciously
hoppy
balanced
with
dark
malt
its
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
had
could
be
my
favorite
brew
from
this
brewery
overall
i
took
a
chance
on
these
bottles
even
though
most
are
over
8
months
old
and
they
were
not
bad
i
think
i
liked
the
king
titus
porter
more
but
this
is
on
great
black
ipa
worth
picking
up
a
uniqur
mashup
of
an
ipa
cascadian
dark
and
a
stout
enjoyable
on
its
own
overall
a
nice
black
ipa
with
well
integrated
roasted
malts
and
fresh
hops
delicious
smoky
roasty
bipa
smoother
than
expected
o
this
beer
got
even
better
after
it
warmed
up
slightly
im
an
ipa
and
a
stout
guy
and
this
is
right
up
the
middle
interesting
hybrid
maine
cannot
make
a
bad
beer
pour
is
dark
brown
mostly
opaque
with
a
tight
creamy
tan
head
nose
has
a
roasted
malt
up
front
light
smokiness
rich
brown
malt
and
strong
citrus
hop
behind
taste
is
even
more
smoky
and
roasted
there
is
brown
malt
notes
of
chocolate
bitter
roast
and
the
hops
are
light
but
have
a
presence
in
back
lighter
body
nice
carbonation
awesome
very
roasty
think
oatmeal
stout
ipa
my
nipples
are
hard
o
these
are
not
all
qualities
i
love
in
a
brew
so
points
are
flowing
less
than
they
might
but
there
is
no
denying
that
this
is
an
interesting
bold
huge
and
distinctive
offering
from
maine
overall
nice
black
ale
i
like
it
more
off
draft
than
in
a
bottle
i
may
have
poured
a
little
bit
of
the
sediment
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
even
though
i
poured
it
carefully
overall
very
tasty
it
was
a
nice
complex
beer
that
bounced
between
hoppy
sweetness
and
roasted
grainy
smoked
flavors
settling
on
a
mild
bitterness
together
quite
flavorful
and
enjoyable
id
definitely
have
this
again
and
its
another
winner
from
maine
beer
co
citrus
with
smoky
finish
huge
frothy
head
easy
three
fingers
very
dark
brown
with
an
unusual
amount
of
larger
bubbles
present
lots
of
craters
across
the
surface
excellent
retention
the
lacing
likewise
thick
and
chunky
and
not
easily
washed
away
the
liquid
is
a
pure
black
while
opaque
in
no
way
cloudy
cant
discern
any
visible
bubbles
early
appearance
in
the
nose
of
white
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
this
succumbs
to
cocoa
coffee
roast
notes
pleasingly
strong
floral
component
too
something
medicinal
like
witch
hazel
the
plum
cherry
fruit
scents
a
touch
muted
never
turns
all
that
complex
but
what
is
there
lingers
powerfully
mediumbodied
the
creamy
mouthfeel
helps
to
delay
the
arrival
of
the
roastiness
and
dark
chocolate
moments
of
chicory
like
bitterness
in
the
end
the
citrus
adds
more
sweetness
than
tartness
still
not
getting
much
more
than
a
vestige
of
mixed
black
fruits
carbonation
assists
in
breaking
up
its
inclinations
towards
heaviness
pine
resin
tar
and
campfire
smoke
contribute
to
the
inner
mouth
perfume
through
the
finish
thankfully
not
over
roasted
so
ends
up
with
a
clean
ending
rather
than
too
astringent
or
bitter
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
little
more
hopforward
not
to
say
they
are
lacking
in
presence
rather
very
wellblended
and
complimentary
maine

greatly
enjoy
every

taste
from
maine
brewing
3
85
very
good
black
ale
would
be
fantastic
with
more
cohesion
o
overall
a
good
black
ipa
not
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
not
mbcs
best
but
quite
good
taste
is
good
and
balanced
worth
checking
out
o
great
effort
again
from
mbc
outright
solid
overall
a
superior
black
ipa
o
great
beer
and
great
brewery
nothing
else
to
say
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
color
is
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
thick
tan
head
consistent
lacing
throughout
plenty
of
carbonation
smell
is
shocking
hops
citrus
with
almost
no
roasted
malt
notes
taste
brings
in
the
roasted
flavors
lightly
in
balance
with
the
hops
just
a
really
balanced
beer
and
amazing
integration
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
overall
im
excited
to
see
more
dark
hoppy
offerings
from
them
the
taste
has
a
potent
hoppy
bitterness
which
supersedes
the
initial
dark
malt
and
black
licorice
character
you
go
away
from
this
thinking
i
loved
those
hops
pours
a
beautiful
dark
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
picked
up
a
little
booze
in
the
aroma
but
its
mostly
roasted
coffee
here
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
hop
and
coffee
bitterness
with
some
roasty
malts
tying
it
all
together
this
brewery
is
doing
everything
right
havent
been
disappointed
in
anything
o
porter
meets
ipa
less
ipa
but
the
flavors
are
there
balanced
no
one
thing
shines
and
nor
really
excels
interesting
mix
of
favors
and
well
executed
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
dark
chocolate
brown
to
black
brew
with
a
very
large
rich
tan
head
aroma
of
melon
and
tropical
fruit
mango
faint
lychee
grapefruit
molasses
dry
chocolate
wafers
and
a
little
pine
needle
nice
freshness
and
complexity
on
the
nose
hop
forward
yet
mildly
roasted
the
palate
largely
follows
suit
although
there
is
more
dry
roast
coffee
and
cacao
powder
that
threatens
to
engulf
the
pine
needle
orange
and
grapefruit
rind
earl
gray
tea
canned
peach
and
lime
juice
hops
flavors
perhaps
i
spoke
too
soon
the
hops
are
beginning
to
shine
through
as
i
type
this
a
pleasant
lemon
pepper
spice
is
revealing
itself
late
along
with
a
touch
of
garlic
mouthfeel
is
a
selling
point
quite
thick
and
chewy
for
the
style
and
with
a
moderate
degree
of
carbonation
finishes
quite
bitter
with
more
citrus
and
steak
spice
plus
a
little
ash
perhaps
the
weakest
of
the
four
maine
beers
ive
sampled
to
date
but
still
pretty
freaking
good
the
cause
described
on
the
bottle
is
even
better
as
my
rescue
cat
nods
her
assent
overall
another
amazing
beer
from
an
amazing
brewery
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
breweries
ever
just
simply
amazing
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
picked
this
beer
up
partially
because
maine
beer
company
has
great
reputation
right
now
and
partially
because
of
the
dedication
to
stray
kitties
but
ill
get
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
because
its
damn
fantastic
beer
poured
a
black
body
with
decent
head
and
lace
patches
along
glass
aroma
is
a
combo
of
light
roasted
malts
and
some
bitter
citric
hops
medium
to
heavy
bodied
with
those
bitter
citric
hops
coming
out
but
only
in
the
background
a
pronounced
roasted
malt
base
is
the
dominant
taste
profile
of
this
beer
and
there
is
a
touch
of
sweetness
not
my
favorite
style
so
maybe
thats
why
i
didnt
rate
so
high
but
an
enjoyable
beer
wonderful
dark
colored
black
ipa
with
a
thick
mocha
head
that
retreats
quickly
gently
lacing
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
hop
aroma
is
present
as
well
as
roasted
coffee
minute
chocolate
taste
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
stronger
coffee
flavor
medium
body
though
pretty
creamy
and
some
char
at
the
finish
overall
i
must
say
this
is
a
pretty
amazing
beer
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
overall
this
thing
drinks
like
a
stout
its
not
as
hop
forward
as
i
expected
actually
a
lot
of
porteresque
chocolate
notes
aromas
have
hints
of
grassy
hop
and
roasted
malt
but
overall
its
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
and
looks
damn
good
in
a
tall
pint
glass
overall
a
black
ipa
with
a
wellrounded
roasted
malt
flavour
and
supporting
citrus
hop
backbone
a
respectable
brew
to
raise
funds
for
local
animal
shelters
o
since
i
like
maine
a
lot
this
was
a
disappointment
for
me
maybe
ill
try
again
in
the
future
if
i
grab
a
fresh
bottle
but
this
was
not
my
favorite
in
this
style
and
certainly
not
my
favorite
from
mbc
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
with
no
problems
its
hands
down
a
great
version
of
the
style
so
far
maines
gone
2
for
2
in
my
books
and
i
still
have
a
pair
in
the
fridge
i
cant
wait
to
drink
my
new
favorite
black
ipa
this
is
still
very
much
an
ipa
with
a
perfect
medium
light
amount
of
roasted
malt
o
one
of
the
best
american
black
alesblack
ipas
ive
had
to
date
not
sure
i
can
justify
another
6
99
on
another
bottle
but
this
was
well
worth
the
try
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
is
there
a
style
these
guys
cant
nail
o
a
great
black
ipa
thats
worth
seeking
out
the
price
is
a
bit
steep
but
a
good
beer
for
a
style
that
i
am
mostly
not
even
middling
about
this
is
the
exception
that
seems
to
shatter
my
rule
roasty
toasty
malt
and
the
typically
heady
citrus
pine
and
floral
hops
of
the
perfect
ipa
ok
ive
seen
this
before
but
never
in
such
a
pleasantly
rounded
and
integrated
manner
its
like
i
know
what
im
tasting
but
suddenly
im
just
freakin
fine
with
it
huh
anyways
this
one
makes
an
impression
in
a
very
good
way
this
is
on
the
better
scale
for
me
of
all
the
black
ipas
that
i
have
had
very
well
done
prost
black
and
opaque
with
a
light
brown
frothy
and
foamy
head
that
lingers
long
with
lumpy
moguls
on
top
low
aroma
of
dark
malt
and
hops
rich
flavor
of
roasty
malt
with
accompanying
bitterness
contribution
a
bit
ashy
hops
accompany
well
and
do
not
overpower
good
balance
big
fat
legs
and
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
rich
and
full
and
round
mouthfeel
roasty
hop
bitterness
lingers
great
beer
atmosphere
is
really
strong
great
persistent
head
and
thick
persistent
lacing
nose
is
earthy
and
malty
with
nuts
and
dark
chocolate
bitter
nutty
character
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
very
solid
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
of
all
time
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
slight
viscosity
and
soft
carbonation
very
dry
and
bitter
up
front
with
the
earthy
hops
and
charred
malt
flavors
playing
off
of
each
other
strong
sticky
resinous
hop
flavor
up
front
with
grass
pine
and
spruce
tip
but
its
missing
the
subtle
citrus
presence
found
in
the
nose
the
hops
are
countered
by
a
deeply
roasted
dark
malt
backbone
that
is
somewhat
acrid
and
nearly
burnt
tasting
the
smoke
presence
is
a
bit
stronger
than
in
the
aroma
with
hints
of
ash
charcoal
and
burnt
toast
along
with
used
coffee
grinds
oatmeal
and
dark
chocolate
this
beer
has
a
decent
balance
of
hops
and
malt
but
tastes
very
one
dimensional
with
a
ton
of
tongue
scraping
dry
bitterness
and
overwhelming
roast
needs
a
lot
more
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
overall
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
but
its
boring
a
bit
harsh
and
tough
to
drink
o
i
love
this
style
when
it
is
executed
correctly
and
this
one
does
a
great
job
i
am
interested
to
see
what
type
of
hops
and
malt
are
used
in
this
because
some
of
the
flavors
expand
further
than
even
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
had
really
awesome
offering
now
on
to
try
another
one
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
to
heavy
body
and
mild
to
moderate
carbonation
leaves
this
smooth
and
drinkable
wonderful
stuff
again
from
these
guys
while
i
enjoyed
its
normalized
variant
another
one
slightly
more
this
is
by
far
the
most
herbal
and
roasted
black
ipa
ive
had
to
date
takes
the
style
to
another
level
that
i
hadnt
even
thought
about
before
this
paired
incredibly
well
with
oregano
soaked
goat
cheese
and
bread
a
nice
dessert
to
have
after
a
meal
too
definitely
worth
picking
up
for
fans
of
ipas
and
porters
taste
is
roasty
and
moderately
bitter
piney
hops
linger
into
the
dry
aftertaste
creamy
and
fairly
substantial
in
body
char
lingers
momentarily
in
the
middle
fading
into
bitter
resinous
hops
overall
its
good
for
what
it
is
but
for
the
price
ill
keep
drinking
wookey
jack
i
believe
that
another
one
and
weez
are
the
same
hop
bill
but
ao
is
a
traditional
ipa
and
weez
is
a
black
ipa
interesting
that
ao
shows
off
lemony
citrus
hop
characteristics
and
weez
displays
lemony
menthol
hops
poured
from
the
simple
but
very
informative
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
weez
is
very
dark
you
can
see
a
slight
dark
brown
hue
when
held
to
the
light
but
otherwise
black
there
is
a
thin
creamy
mocha
colored
head
that
hangs
around
all
day
the
nose
is
a
nice
mixture
of
aromatic
hops
and
dark
malty
notes
the
taste
prevails
in
the
hop
direction
initially
with
a
sweet
piney
resinous
hop
flavor
and
then
shifts
back
to
a
bready
burnt
chocolate
semidry
finish
mouthfeel
is
lighter
than
expected
and
goes
down
easy
mild
but
adequate
carbonation
helps
too
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
great
representative
for
the
state
of
maine
overall
the
most
enjoyable
thing
about
this
brew
was
its
aroma
the
hops
are
much
more
prominent
here
from
the
get
go
but
the
flavoring
does
catch
up
more
and
more
as
it
warms
with
oily
resins
working
their
way
in
between
the
dense
layers
of
chocolate
malts
and
char
this
beer
does
just
the
right
amount
of
blending
with
that
unique
black
ale
oily
sweetness
of
hops
that
marries
so
so
well
with
the
darkness
of
the
grain
bill
the
product
works
to
somehow
lighten
and
denude
the
malts
a
bit
and
is
a
quality
that
weve
appreciated
in
the
best
beers
of
the
style
this
beer
has
been
a
long
time
coming
and
again
and
with
a
new
style
to
their
lineup
nonetheless
continued
to
impress
us
with
their
versatility
and
general
prowess
o
maine
brewing
is
moving
up
my
favorites
list
very
quickly
this
black
ipa
was
really
tasty
and
would
definitely
have
another
yet
another
well
made
beer
by
the
folks
up
at
maine
beer
co
weez
like
i
said
above
im
not
a
normally
a
black
ipa
guy
but
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
with
a
complex
malt
profile
and
bright
hoppiness
id
give
weez
another
go
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
thanks
ryan
it
seems
like
more
and
more
good
hoppy
black
ales
are
popping
up
or
i
am
appreciating
the
style
more
good
flavor
seems
to
switch
back
and
forth
between
rich
roast
and
resinous
hops
its
good
and
i
like
it
but
it
could
be
better
o
excellent
brew
from
maine
beer
co
definitely
recommend
and
would
have
this
again
onice
black
ale
good
flavors
and
feel
solid
ale
overall
not
bad
for
a
black
ipa
nice
malts
the
hops
get
a
little
in
the
way
of
it
and
the
malts
get
in
the
way
of
the
hops
so
overall
again
i
think
this
is
a
completely
flawed
style
and
this
shows
why
two
different
beers
same
hops
different
malts
the
wheat
and
light
malt
beer
in
the
another
one
was
awesome
and
the
hops
brought
resin
tropical
fruit
juicy
generic
fruit
floral
aroma
very
nice
hop
character
the
dark
malts
drown
out
the
nice
part
of
the
hops
and
contrast
what
comes
through
from
the
nice
hops
and
brings
out
the
less
interesting
parts
of
the
hops
just
not
nearly
as
tasty
black
with
a
medium
creamy
beige
head
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
malt
resinous
tropical
fruits
and
caramel
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
roasted
malt
pine
tropical
fruits
caramel
and
a
light
bitter
finish
medium
body
slightly
dry
average
carbonation
good
black
ipa
a
tad
watery
on
the
finish
but
well
balanced
and
drinkable
aplenty
o
real
good
beer
cant
see
any
fan
of
abas
not
liking
it
and
i
think
it
has
a
very
approachable
character
for
any
drinker
on
par
in
my
estimation
with
most
of
the
popular
beers
in
the
aba
style
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
original
trial
batch
of
zoe
years
ago
before
it
became
an
amber
ale
this
and
another
one
are
the
same
hops
with
different
grains
i
found
the
hops
being
far
more
dominant
in
another
one
this
is
like
a
hoppy
stout
and
in
a
great
way
good
example
of
the
style
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
mf
medium
light
bodied
dry
finish
but
not
necessarily
a
lasting
bitterness
recommended
by
my
local
beer
shop
i
gave
it
a
try
did
not
know
what
i
was
trying
as
the
label
said
ale
it
is
a
black
ale
with
a
good
dose
of
hops
i
tried
it
but
not
my
type
of
beer
hops
are
still
present
maine
beer
co
loves
to
showcase
their
hops

color
with
2
inches
of
frothy
light
brown
head
tons
of
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
grapefruit
citrus
hops
smoke
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
more
of
the
chocolate
and
smoke
than
the
citrus
hops
which
is
the
exact
opposite
of
the
aroma
earthy
with
lots
of
dark
chocolate
bitterness
some
grapefruit
sprinkled
in
here
and
there
dark
roast
black
coffee
and
espresso
at
the
finish
lots
of
malt
flavor
heavily
carbonated
most
of
the
bitterness
here
doesnt
come
from
the
citrus
hops
but
rather
the
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
the
smell
made
me
believe
this
was
going
to
be
a
lot
hoppier
than
it
was
overall
pretty
good
black
ipa
that
id
say
tastes
more
like
a
porter
than
the
recent
run
of
hoppy
black
ales
o
very
good
beer
i
love
the
strong
hop
aroma
of
a
good
dipa
with
the
mix
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
well
balanced
and
delicious
overall
not
bad
but
considering
that
this
is
quite
a
fresh
bottle
the
hops
are
surprisingly
overpowered
by
the
malt
as
a
companion
beer
another
one
is
much
better
odpretty
neat
my
interest
and
enjoyment
of
black
ipas
has
waned
but
this
one
is
a
treat
probably
my
least
favorite
of
all
the
maine

co
offerings
poured
a

ounce
into
a
chilled
pint
glass
that
said
its
still
better
then
almost
anything
readily
available
at
my
local
liquor
store
i
was
tricked
by
the
label
claiming
that
it
had
the
same
hops
as
another
one

very

very

to

so
not

exciting

big
black

with
a
nice
balance
between
sweet

and
fresh

thick

but
still
rather
sweet
sweet
very
hoppy
grapefruit
after
taste
freakin
great
just
drink
it
i
would
consider
it
to
be
a
black
ipa
regardless
very
enjoyable
dark
brown
to
almost
black
appearance
with
a
big
light
tan
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
dark
roasted
grain
peat
and
earthy
pine
on
the
palate
the
initial
attack
is
roasted
malts
a
hint
of
chocolate
followed
by
a
nice
lingering
piney
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
creamy
carbonation
is
mild
but
adequate
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
black
ale
ive
had
to
date
this
style
of
beer
usually
tastes
disjointed
to
me
but
not
nighttime
lagunitas
has
done
a
great
job
of
creating
a
balanced
and
full
flavored
black
ale
not
to
be
missed
overall
cannot
explain
how
well
balanced
this
is
hoppy
yet
enough
roast
and
coffeechocolate
wow
im
glad
i
grabbed
this
best
black
s
le
ive
had
yet
dark
fruit
with
citrus
smooth
with
a
slight
tingle
going
down
a
wonderfully
dank
hop
forward
black
ipa
with
great
balance
fantastic
brew
overall
this
is
a
super
solid
black
ipa
super
balanced
and
drinkable
i
would
defiantly
buy
again
as
good
as
it
gets
love
this
brew
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
straight
down
and
watched
in
pleasure
couldnt
pour
it
all
as
the
head
was
at
least
3
even
after
23
minutes
still
some
head
after
several
sips
and
nice
lacing
as
well
nice
hop
flavor
and
some
maltiness
as
well

its
a
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
nice
smokey
flavor
would
sleep
with
this
beer
if
i
could
instead
i
drink
it
like
the
dirty
whore
it
is
just
an
outstanding
example
of
black
ipa
probably
my
favorite
of
this
style
this
has
a
deep
brown
color
beautiful
aroma
of
citric
and
tropical
hops
and
a
great
flavor
blend
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
its
really
really
good
as
a
reviewer
asked
is
this
the
best
american
black
ale
it
might
be
the
smell
had
fruity
hints
the
taste
was
a
little
more
bitter
than
expected
tasted
like
an
above
average
dark
ipa
overall
a
great
ale
big
flavors
and
unique
profile
with
a
heavy
hop
aroma
and
stronger
roast
taste
overall
i
was
hoping
this
beer
to
be
more
hop
heavy
coming
from
lagunitas
but
it
should
satisfy
the
more
malt
heavy
fans
wanting
to
dip
their
toes
in
the
hop
pool
this
beer
has
some
hoppiness
to
it
but
its
really
chained
up
all
bark
and
no
bite
if
you
say
this
isnt
a
black
ipa
in
my
book
maybe
a
pale
black
ale
or
just
a
slight
hoppier
stout
not
a
huge
roasted
malt
fan
so
my
rating
might
be
bias
fruity
hop
nose
with
slight
roast
nearly
pitch
black
nice
roasted
yet
fruity
hop
light
pine
finish
mouthfeel
is
awesome
no
alcohol
present
in
this
which
will
creep
upon
you
at
first
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
beer
isnt
aware
of
what
it
really
is
but
then
i
realize
its
the
mixture
that
hits
on
all
points
and
no
where
in
here
does
it
seem
to
fall
flat
or
awkward
excellent
beer
all
around
i
think
it
has
one
of
the
best
mouthfeeltaste
combo
out
there
good
stuff
had
at
5
horses
after
ebf
this
is
every
bit
of
a
refreshing
ipa
that
you
could
think
of
except
it
looks
dark
thats
the
only
thing
it
just
looks
dark
tastes
fantastic
not
much
going
for
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
citrus
and
pine
taste
is
also
a
bit
hoppy
mostly
citrus
some
pine
roasted
malts
are
present
but
in
the
background
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
tasty
beer
worth
a
shot
i
wouldnt
drink
too
many
as
the
odd
flavor
combo
is
heavy
on
the
palate
extremely
citrusy
hops
for
how
dark
the
beer
is
o
take
this
review
with
grain
of
salt
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
to
say
the
least
this
offering
specifically
however
seemed
especially
disjointed
and
at
times
outright
offensive
to
the
senses
beneath
the
already
questionable
combination
of
burnt
malt
and
piney
hops
not
that
theres
anything
wrong
with
that
was
a
note
of
chemical
i
dont
think
i
was
poisoned
but
this
offflavor
was
prominent
enough
to
deduct
significantly
from
otherwise
wholesome
flavors
but
i
can
say
this
it
was
not
a
pussy
beer
it
put
its
flavors
out
there
for
all
to
see
and
if
you
didnt
like
it
then
to
hell
with
you
too
smokey
burnt
and
the
flavors
arent
balanced
in
a
way
that
makes
any
sense
it
looks
great
and
smells
great
and
is
definitely
interesting
but
needs
more
malt
and
less
smoke
just
ok
overall
a
great
representation
of
style
hops
and
roasted
malt
that
get
better
with
each
sip
the
smokiness
sets
it
apart
from
other
black
ipas
but
i
think
it
gets
in
the
way
of
the
great
hops
and
roasted
malt
still
a
great
beer
and
worth
enjoying
i
usually
prefer
darker
heavier
brews
from
the
tap
but
this
was
absolutely
delicious
in
a
bottle
overall
picked
up
a
single
to
try
since
black
ales
can
be
hit
or
miss
with
me
this
is
pretty
good
but
actually
seems
more
like
a
regular
ipa
than
black
ipa
the
roasted
malts
dont
make
much
of
an
impression
its
fine
but
dont
expect
a
lot
of
roast
mixed
with
your
citrus
this
beer
looked
and
smelled
magnificent
it
tasted
very
good
dark
brown
in
color
hoppy
nose
the
malt
profile
is
certainly
there
but
it
is
not
as
wellrepresented
as
it
should
be
in
this
style
the
hoppy
finish
is
the
feature
here
which
is
not
really
a
surprise
piney
hoppy
not
really
my
type
of
beer
sorry
overall
a
nice
beer
plenty
of
flavor
hop
forward
without
being
too
bitter
which
is
definitely
a
plus
for
me
great
black
ipa
nothing
to
complain
about
really
enjoy
this
one
you
get
some
grapefruit
hops
aroma
but
i
caught
a
lot
more
burnt
malt
than
a
most
reviewers
seem
to
be
getting
it
tastes
like
charred
bbq
with
the
hops
as
way
more
of
a
background
flavor
definitely
smokier
darker
than
a
lot
of
the
reviews
led
me
to
believe
but
that
is
just
what
i
tasted
had
this
last
year
in
a
22
bomber
excited
that
its
released
in
sixer
this
year
a
very
hoppy
flavorful
dark
ale
with
hints
of
roasted
chocolate
this
is
up
there
with
shorts
good
nite
bodacious
and
stones
subliminal
self
rightious
very
balanced
bipa
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
one
is
well
done
id
take
a
regular
ipa
or
dipa
over
this
any
day
but
this
beer
didnt
disappoint
i
thought
it
was
okay
just
seemed
a
bit
over
roasted
for
my
taste
great
beer
but
i
feel
that
dubhe
takes
the
competition
by
storm
as
i
feel
dubhe
has
more
complexities
character
and
flavor
to
it
a
great
ipa
but
right
off
the
bat
this
thing
doesnt
taste
nearly
as
black
as
it
looks
this
beer
has
a
serious
west
coast
style
hop
profile
to
use
cliches
but
lacks
the
roasted
malt
backbone
its
color
and
style
suggest
i
may
be
fixating
on
the
trivia
but
i
guess
its
just
leaving
me
a
little
confused
since
it
tastes
like
its
golden
in
color
but
boasts
its
darkness
a
drinkable
enjoyable
ale
none
the
less
though
would
be
happy
to
have
this
anomaly
at
my
disposal
at
all
times
mouthfeel
and
finish
are
prime
this
black
ipa
brings
an
intense
hop
profile
that
is
well
complemented
by
the
dark
malt
i
wouldnt
call
it
balanced

is
my
favorite
lagunitas
seasonal
brew
picked
up
a
sixer
last
night
ive
been
looking
forward
to
its
release
since
the
last
time
i
had
some
was
straight
out
of
the
tap
in
the
employee
lounge
at
the
lagunitas
chicago
location
my
son
in
law
had
a
part
time
summer
job
there
im
not
much
of
a
dark
beer
guy
but
this
tastes
like
a
bold
ipa
with
a
slight
sweet
stout
flavor
there
seems
to
be
5
or
6
flavors
going
on
while
i
drink
this
that
i
cant
quite
describe
other
than
an
overall
heavenly
taste

overall
this
is
tasty
and
worth
checking
out
12
oz
bottle
pours
black
with
tall
long
lasting
fluffy
beige
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
tropical
fruit
and
toasted
malt
body
is
full
and
tangy
citrusy
hops
dominate
the
palate
while
dark
fruit
toasted
malt
and
coffee
linger
in
the
background
finish
is
long
and
dry
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
one
tasty
brew
tons
of
head
and
lacing
smells
of
delicious
grapefuity
pale
ale
but
flavor
has
tons
of
roasted
malts
combined
with
citrus
almost
like
an
orange
flavored
dark
chocolate
despite
the
high
gravity
also
highly
drinkable
my
new
favorite
lagunitas
beer
yummy
perfect
for
a
cold
night
this
is
one
of
my
first
of
the
style
but
really
surprised
at
how
well
the
subtle
taste
of
the
roasted
malts
blend
with
the
grapefruit
heavy
flavors
this
does
smell
similar
to
daytime
which
for
me
is
a
good
thing
this
is
a
really
great
brew
one
that
i
didnt
think
id
like
makes
me
want
to
check
out
more
if
this
style
highly
drinkable
and
mouthfeel
wise
its
pretty
nice
the
initial
citrus
astringency
gives
way
to
a
malt
sweetness
that
coats
the
tongue
nicely
i
was
surprised
somewhat
at
the
roast
and
light
chocolate
qualities
given
the
initial
hop
bite
and
aroma
that
said
i
kind
of
feel
like
there
are
better
options
in
either
direction
depending
on
what
your
persuasion
might
be
whether
you
stay
with
lagunitas
or
change
brands
at
any
rate
its
worth
drinking
for
a
change
of
pace
sweet
with
cloying
sweet
finish
that
said
if
you
like
fruity
hoppy
brews
this
is
probably
a
good
one
at
7
9
abv
its
really
strong
compared
to
what
it
tastes
like
as
always
lagunitas
impresses
nite
in
a
tulip
light
head
beautiful
dark
color
definitely
a
black
ipa
perfect
very
solid
black
ale
if
you
are
a
fan
of
ipas
definitely
worthy
of
trying
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
hoppy
hint
of
bo
well
balanced
good
finish
great
toasty
flavor
great
for
a
cold
day
or
night
o
very
very
nice
grapefruit
juice
aroma
the
flavour
is
a
bit
messy
but
otherwise
its
a
very
good
cda
o
this
sets
the
standard
for
black
ipas
probably
the
best
of
the
style
ive
had
really
glad
to
see
its
not
a
limited
release
as
my
bottle
states
and
is
now
a
seasonal
12oz
6pack
o
4
5
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
ever
had
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
o
nice
piney
black
ale
o
good
beer
a
little
strong
for
my
liking
though
amazing
offering
from
lagunitas
i
love
a
well
done
black
ipa
and
they
have
really
nailed
it
with
this
smoky
and
hoppy
with
a
beautiful
balance
between
the
two
rich
and
creamy
smooth
and
smoky
pungent
and
hoppy
cool
evening
beer
loaded
with
flavor
paired
with
some
smoky
bentons
bacon
and
scrambled
eggs
filled
with
gouda
sublime
just
released
so
the
hops
are
there
but
most
remarkable
to
me
is
the
smoky
kick
i
dont
typically
like
smoky
beers
but
this
one
strikes
a
good
balance
the
smokiness
is
detectable
but
not
overbearing
and
balanced
by
the
strong
hop
presence
a
good
affordable
beer
worth
sipping
the
finish
aftertaste
was
deep
and
very
enjoyable
all
around
great
beer
smell
taste
very
smooth
o
i
will
absolutely
pick
up
another
6er
for
10
99
and
look
forward
to
the
next
time
this
is
released
amazing
my
new
favorite
black
ipa
o
not
what
i
expected
at
all
in
a
good
way
the
hop
presence
is
surely
on
top
and
on
point
but
the
malty
subtance
gives
it
a
good
backbone
to
ride
on
very
nice
balance
an
early
summer
in
a
bottle
definite
buy
just
dont
e
tit
warm
up
too
long
which
shouldnt
really
be
a
problem
all
around
wonderful
brew
hits
every
sense
perfectly
overall
this
is
a
nice
treat
but
be
ready
for
loads
of
flavor
hitting
you
broadside
initially
drank
at
38
degrees
but
overtime
warmed
up
to
about
45
degrees
which
was
very
refreshing
slightly
strange
sweet
smell
but
the
taste
well
makes
up
for
it
very
slight
licorice
overtones
in
the
aftertaste
that
reminded
me
of
a
more
full
bodied
goose
island
muddy
very
highly
recommended
o
another
winner
from
lagunitas

with

the

was
a

surpise
that
it
wasnt
over
powering

of
bitter

smooth

a
very
appealing

it

enjoy

i
consider
to
be
one
of
the
best
dipas
out
there
easily
up
there
with
sucks
pliny
and
enjoy
by

can
not
wait
for
this
to
come
back
and
i
heard
its
coming
in
a
six
pack
a
smooth
big
malty
black
ipa
brings
together
a
solid
hoppy
feel
with
the
roasted
chocolate
notes
really
well
made
a
typically
robust
yet
easy
drinking
beer
from
lagunitas
its
good
but
the
bitter
after
taste
got
to
me
after
awhile
a
little
too
hoppy
for
a
dark
beer
o
with
milder
hop
flavor
than
most
amer
black
ipas
this
is
more
of
a
black
apa
great
beer
yes
this
is
a
great
beer
definitely
comparable
to
the
ssra
from
stone
and
perhaps
a
bit
easier
drinking
touch
more
hops
and
less
abv
the
color
is
nearly
opaque
with
think
ecru
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
scent
carries
citrusy
like
hop
the
taste
is
evenly
balanced
with
a
mouthfeel
that
is
fuller
in
body
with
subtle
carbonation
great
beer
nice
job
lagunitas
not
one
to
fear
the
dark
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
after
a
bit
of
chilling
to
about
50
degrees
f
i
poured
a
nice
pint
which
showed
a
brownish
red
not
black
but
not
translucent
either
one
inch
head
lingered
for
quite
a
while
and
left
heavy
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
malty
and
nutty
with
a
bit
of
funk
taste
is
similar
but
lacking
funk
the
sweetness
is
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
bitters
and
maltiness
some
fruit
qualities
although
a
coffee
aftertaste
presents
mouth
feel
starts
creamy
but
quickly
changes
to
a
slight
carbonated
bite
outstanding
black

hop
character
marries
perfectly
with
deep
roasted
flavors
anise
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
body
carries
the
flavors
quite
well
dark
with
delightfully
contrasting
light
citrus
has
a
surprising
twang
a
spicy
almostsour
bend
at
the
middle
of
the
flavor
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
damned
fine
beer
and
a
massive
experience
of
flavors
nose
and
mouthfeel
that
combine
to
be
greater
than
the
sum
i
cannot
recommend
this
one
highly
enough
it
is
a
superb
beer
and
one
that
everyone
should
experience
i
will
absolutely
be
drinking
this
one
again
the
dudes
and
dudettes
at
lagunitas
come
across
as
the
coolest
chillest
people
in
the
business
and
they
have
the
portfolio
to
match

profile
is
complex
well
balanced
and
does
a
stellar
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
it
begins
with
the
sweet
tropical
then
flows
to
pine
as
the
mild
bitterness
begins
the
middle
is
where
this
beer
excels
as
the
bitterness
equilibrates
the
coffeetoffee
roast
and
sweet
chocolate
come
to
the
forefront
in
an
effervescent
flash
the
finish
is
somewhat
dry
and
leaves
a
nice
lingering
light
bitterness
on
the
tongue
with
a
light
toffee
and
chocolate
flavored
sweetness
coupled
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
rind
tartness
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
think
it
is
sucks
with
some
roasted
hops
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
love
it
very
solid
black
ipa
nice
and
dry
finish
with
a
very
pronounced
hop
character
they
definitely
use
rye
in
the
malt
the
malt
base
is
flavorful
and
complex
yet
very
clean
and
not
underwhelming
the
prominent
hop
kick
definitely
just
as
solid
as
lots
of
other
great
black
ipas
which
are
double
the
price
my
new
go
to
for
the
style
a
damn
good
black
ipa
this
was
unusually
dynamic
as
each
sip
was
different
and
yet
balanced
at
the
same
time
this
brew
hid
the
alcohol
completely
and
was
easy
to
drink
another
great
beer
from
lagunitas
that
i
highly
recommend
c
one
of
the
best
they
do
a
great
balance
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
i
didnt
like
it
as
well
as
sublimely
and
of
the
lagunitas
pair
i
would
prefer
daytime
but
a
solid
beer
that
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
up
again
when
i
see
it
rating
a
poured
a
lighter
black
with
a
huge
head
aroma
of
malt
and
lots
of
hops
tastes
interesting
i
get
lots
of
hops
with
sweet
malt
and
tons
of
pepper
flavor
not
to
big
on
the
pepper
flavor
this
one
is
ok
o
what
a
great
beer
for
fall
so
many
good
flavors
hoppy
and
sweet
overall
impression
a
velvet
hammer
hoppy
complex
and
immensely
drinkable
great
stuff
o
dont
fear
the
dark
night
time
is
another
winner
from
lagunitas
easy
drinking
priced
nice
love
this
brewery
o
very
very
good
i
had
this
a
few
days
after
a
ten
fidy
which
was
da
bomb
so
comparisons
are
hard
this
was
extremely
good
this
is
truly
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
this
year
o
quite
tasty
change
of
pace
never
thought
tropical
fruit
would
work
so
well
in
something
this
dark
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
really
like
this
one
i
have
never
had
a
black
ale
and
this
one
is
on
the
money
i
have
always
heard
good
things
about
lagunitas
but
had
not
tried
any
of
their
beers
you
can
bet
i
will
be
trying
more
of
their
stuff
after
this
one
really
good
for
putting
you
to
sleep
har
har
har
strong
flavor
and
bitterness
great
when
chilled
its
dark
and
it
definitely
has
a
punch
compared
to
lagunitas
other
offerings
malty
and
black
great
as
a
night
cap
what
a
nice
surprise
i
like
black
ipas
and
this
is
a
winner
for
sure
might
be
more
complex
that
stone
ssr
well
done
lag
smooth
and
hoppy
with
grapefruit
leading
the
way
excellent
22oz
bottle
served
in
a
tulip
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
frothy
one
inch
khakicolored
head
nose
is
piney
in
the
foreground
with
a
slight
roasted
quality
in
the
back
taste
consistent
with
nose
with
the
addition
of
bakers
chocolate
and
a
light
slightly
medicinal
bitterness
lingering
between
quaffs
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
a
lively
carbonation
and
a
slight
acidity
for
me
this
beer
didnt
capitalize
on
the
roastymalty
goodness
ive
come
to
associate
with
the
style
all
and
all
not
really
my
thing
heard
great
things
about
this
brew
but
honestly
was
disappointed
just
didnt
have
that
great
of
taste
a
good
nightcap
i
dont
know
why
i
even
go
after
these
black
ipas
this
one
pours
a
sleek
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
sandstone
foam
the
nose
comprises
coffee
cocoa
powder
grapefruit
zest
and
a
touch
of
treacle
the
taste
is
a
straight
blast
of
cocoa
and
coffeecovered
grapefruit
ruby
red
and
yellow
baby
the
two
factions
putting
on
a
great
performance
of
west
side
story
what
seems
like
fighting
is
actually
tightlychoreographed
and
highly
cooperative
dancing
theres
also
a
nice
underlying
current
of
molasses
throughout
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
lately
one
i
might
actually
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
at
a
later
date
well
done
lagunitas
one
of
the
best
american
black
ales
ive
had
to
date
rich
in
malt
and
juicy
hops
everything
blends
well
together
very
enjoyable
this
tastes
like
a
weak
stout
mixed
with
a
deschutes
inversion
ipa
i
dont
like
this
maybe
you
will
i
had
this
on
draft
at
whym
outside
portsmouth
nh
bought
a
couple
bottles
and
the
flavors
seem
a
bit
subdued
naturaly
black
ipas
are
hitting
the
spot
for
me
these
days
this
is
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
tasted
that
simple
overall
a
phenomenal
and
complex
beer
that
i
will
buy
again
one
of
the
best
5
bombers
that
i
have
ever
purchased
o
lagunitas
hit
it
out
of
the
park
on
this
brew
glad
i
purchased
this
one
for
5
this
is
an
excellent
purchase
this
is
a
great
mix
of
ipa
and
dark
malt
the
best
i
have
had
o
3
50
this
is
a
8
2
beer
but
there
is
no
taste
or
sense
of
alcohol
the
65
ibus
gives
a
little
bitter
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
but
doesnt
make
the
beer
harsh
the
smell
and
taste
are
nice
this
is
not
just
a
dark
colored
ipa
there
are
some
stoutesque
characters
on
the
finish
like
the
hint
of
sweet
coffee
overall
this
is
a
nice
hop
forward
representation
of
the
black
ale
style
the
flavors
blend
together
very
nicely
definitely
seek
it
out
while
it
is
still
fresh
and
available
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
on
the
market
mixes
both
the
dark
roasted
flavors
and
the
light
citrus
flavors
extremely
well
overall
mixed
bag
and
kinda
meh
hard
to
drink
this
for
sure
between
the
huge
bitterness
of
the
astringent
rindy
hops
and
the
acrid
roasted
malt
which
isnt
very
strong
but
its
there
and
the
phenolic
booze
kick
in
the
pants
and
the
thin
feel
those
unhappy
flavors
way
outnumber
the
decent
ones
nose
was
pretty
nice
though
o
this
is
a
great
beer
i
found
a
bottle
at
fresh
market
for
5
and
had
a
feeling
i
needed
to
scoop
it
i
was
right
i
have
turned
into
somewhat
of
a
hop
head
but
this
was
a
very
refreshing
outstanding
brew
why
dont
they
ever
put
great
beers
like
this
in
a
six
pack
overall
big
punch
complicated
profile
with
the
almost
sappy
sweet
burnt
coffee
and
the
hop
monster
fighting
for
attention
a
good
example
of
a
black
ipa
more
of
everything
approach
i
dont
think
it
would
age
well
its
a
fresh
juicy
ipa
with
some
depth
one
of
the
top
black
ipas
out
in
the
market
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
the
smoke
dominates
improving
the
aroma
this
is
an
interesting
experiment
im
not
sorry
i
bought
it
but
wouldnt
get
another
one
not
the
best
black
ipa
or
hoppy
black
ale
whatever
you
want
to
call
these
things
just
not
enough
of
the
dark
malt
comes
out
in
the
flavor
but
some
is
evident
im
glad
i
tried
this
and
will
look
for
it
again
the
signature
charecteristics
of
the
brand
carry
this
and
i
am
quite
fine
with
that
ive
yet
to
meet
a
laguntias
beer
that
i
did
not
like
excellent
beer
highly
recommended
overall
this
might
be
the
best
american
black
i
have
tried
a
brewer
needs
to
be
careful
with
this
style
and
lagunitas
has
mastered
it
good
black
ipa
never
had
a
bad
thing
from
lagunitas
and
this
one
didnt
disappoint
either
a
good
strong
black
ale
with
robust
flavor
and
inviting
mouthfeel
22
oz
bomber
pours
a
root
beer
color
with
sufficient
head
and
lacing
nice
pine
and
floral
nose
with
subdued
roasted
malt
really
like
the
clean
biting
taste
of
this
one
a
bit
like
a
floor
cleanser
but
in
a
good
way
i
taste
pine
apricot
dark
fruits
and
a
light
smokey
backbone
like
the
way
this
beer
sticks
to
the
back
of
the
tongue
as
it
goes
down
begging
for
another
sip
overall
a
really
nice
black
ale
and
at
4
99
a
bomber
in
north
texas
a
real
value
a
very
nice
black
ipa
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
blackish
color
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
dies
down
to
light
pools
of
tan
foam
and
great
lacing
nose
of
grapefruit
like
hops
deeply
roasted
grains
a
earthy
goodness
nice
taste
profile
going
on
here
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
up
front
mingling
nicely
with
sweet
roasted
malts
on
the
back
and
sides
herbal
like
quality
with
a
roasted
grains
and
syrupy
sweet
malts
dripping
down
a
cascade
of
citrus
hops
it
is
not
what
i
expected
nor
what
i
was
really
after
in
a
dark
brew
that
said
it
is
a
hop
heads
delight
and
a
foray
into
the
darker
side
of
ale
without
leaving
the
realm
of
overly
hopped
beers
excellent
but
stillcan
we
tame
some
of
the
hops
so
i
can
taste
something
other
than
grapefruit
citrus
hops
in
the
absence
of
light
this
has
a
deep
dark
brown
appearance
with
bright
light
this
has
a
deep
ruby
red
color
that
darkens
on
the
edges
poured
with
a
short
light
beige
foam
that
reduced
to
a
thin
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
dank
ripe
citrus
hop
aromas
along
with
earthy
grainy
roasted
malt
and
fresh
resinous
pine
hop
notes
at
the
end
full
bodied
smooth
creamy
body
up
front
that
resinous
feel
through
the
middle
and
tangy
tight
carbonation
from
the
middle
to
the
end
roasted
malt
and
tropical
citrus
hop
flavors
up
front
with
the
hop
flavor
expanding
into
the
middle
pine
hop
flavors
are
introduced
in
the
middle
overtop
the
sturdy
roasted
malt
backbone
and
slowly
expand
from
the
middle
to
the
end
finished
cleanly
with
a
lingering
roasted
malt
and
bitter
hop
aftertaste
complex
and
enjoyable
appearance
of
very
dark
brown
but
not
quite
black
with
a
nice
creamy
colored
head
the
smell
was
full
of
hops
and
bitter
fruit
like
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
lot
of
hops
making
a
grapefruit
taste
but
also
a
nice
lingering
sour
taste
not
bad
just
like
a
sour
pink
grapefruit
flavor
very
interesting
the
mouthfeel
was
also
nice
as
it
was
not
overly
thick
like
i
thought
it
might
be
overall
very
good
a
very
nice
take
on
this
style
as
expected
from
these
guys
wish
the
nose
was
better
but
this
drinks
so
easy
for
the
abv
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
black
double
ipa
feels
for
about
five
bucks
it
is
very
hard
to
recommend
something
better
enjoy
it
and
appreciate
salud
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
an
excellent
representation
of
an
american
black
ale
in
my
opinion
could
also
be
classified
as
a
black
ipa
i
believe
not
too
sure
of
the
difference
anyway
d
kinda
big
but
a
fun
beer
this
one
should
be
shared
a
heavy
beer
with
a
potent
hopmaltlicorice
ratio
and
an
intriguing
new
entry
to
the
wonderful
world
of
the
black
ipa
o
lagunitas
delivered
on
this
brew
and
then
some
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
out
there
the
bursting
citrus
hop
flavor
tastes
remarkably
fresh
and
pungent
a
steal
at
less
than
5
a
bomber
found
a
bomber
for
just
under
5
poured
into
a
16
oz
glass
last
night
it
had
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
that
held
quite
well
right
when
i
cracked
open
the
bottle
i
could
smell
it
it
was
delicious
since
im
still
new
to
craft
beer
i
usually
cant
pick
out
individual
fruits
that
hops
give
off
but
right
away
i
got
mangoes
the
taste
didnt
disappoint
either
the
malts
balanced
the
hops
so
that
it
was
easy
to
drink
for
such
a
big
abv
and
of
course
the
mangoes
i
honestly
cant
rave
about
this
enough
to
date
its
probably
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
im
still
new
to
craft
beer
im
definitely
gonna
buy
another
one
or
two
o
i
think
this
is
the
first
beer
of
this
style
that
ive
had
i
would
have
classified
this
as
a
black
iipa
based
on
flavortaste
profile
a
good
balance
between
bitterness
and
sweetness
which
seems
to
be
hard
to
accomplish
with
black
ipas
or
similar
beer
styles
id
drink
this
again
prost
there
is
an
assertive
dark
malt
and
hop
flavor
but
decently
balanced
with
the
hops
lingering
at
the
finish
it
gets
good
grades
and
with
good
reason
o
very
interesting
the
hop
aroma
took
me
by
surprise
for
a
black
ale
and
the
smokiness
of
the
flavor
was
also
surprising
since
i
didnt
get
any
of
that
in
the
aroma
o
judging
by
this
beers
appearance
you
wouldnt
assume
that
it
would
be
packed
with
aromas
and
flavors
of
citrusy
hops
the
taste
has
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
citrus
and
the
roasted
malts
that
makes
it
almost
taste
like
a
hybrid
between
a
typical
ipa
and
a
black
ipa
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
perceptible
poured
this
out
of
a
22oz
bomber
into
a
chalice
the
beer
poured
a
nice
pitchblack
color
with
a
fingerwidth
creamy
head
providing
plenty
of
lacing
along
the
way
the
aroma
is
a
combo
of
toasted
malt
and
piney
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
the
toasted
malt
character
upfront
followed
shortly
by
a
piney
hop
flavor
a
resinous
hop
bitterness
lingers
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
fullbodied
but
with
a
noticeable
carbonation
bite
overall
the
beer
is
not
too
complex
but
is
nevertheless
delicious
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
will
definitely
grab
this
one
again
overall
i
give
this
fine
ale
black
ipa
or
black
ale
what
have
you
4
5
with
a
strong
non
drunk
opinion
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
had
this
beer
and
compared
to
others
of
its
caliber
like
sublimely
self
righteous
it
really
does
hold
its
own
and
also
stand
apart
in
terms
of
drinkability
and
taste
this
is
one
of
lagunitas
better
offerings
cheers
overall
a
pretty
good
black
ale
maybe
a
little
onedimensional
compared
to
some
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
light
black
in
color
with
and
i
can
just
see
through
it
when
i
hold
it
up
to
light
a
half
inch
thick
tightly
knit
beige
head
sits
on
top
brussels
lacing
light
aroma
of
piney
hops
is
presentbut
is
definitely
on
the
fainter
end
compared
to
other
black
ipas
the
flavor
is
strongly
of
piney
hops
and
that
very
familiar
hop
flavor
common
to
lagunitas
the
mouth
is
silky
smooth
and
light
considering
the
abv
oliked
the
taste
of
this
black
ale
alcohol
wellintegrated
making
this
beer
easy
to
drink
black
pour
with
a
sisal
cap
of
persistent
creamy
foam
heavy
lacing
smells
of
grapefruit
and
roasted

pith
citrus
rind
pine
roasted

chocolate
moderately
bitter
creamy
and
medium
bodied
lingering
bitter
citrus
and
roast

finish
a
good
classic
black
ipa
o
definetly
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
the
flavors
are
very
well
balanced
this
is
another
winner
from
lagunitas

this
beer
may
speak
in
and
of
itself
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
it
has
nice
dark
hue
with
a
decent
tan
head
leaving
some
light
lacing
the
aroma
is
pine
resin
the
taste
is
hoppy
with
the
pine
and
citrus
bouncing
off
each
other
there
is
a
nice
weight
to
the
body
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
my
only
complaint
really
is
that
this
isnt
what
i
was
expecting
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
latunitas
ipa
with
a
different
malt
bill
which
is
what
it
is
dialing
up
the
abv
doesnt
make
it
something
else
strong
ale
means
something
in
beer
terms
and
this
isnt
it
so
enjoy
the
beer
because
it
is
well
made
just
know
this
isnt
a
strong
ale
overall
when
i
think
lagunitas
i
think
lots
of
hops
lots
of
body
and
perhaps
a
distinct
strain
of
yeast
this
beer
has
all
that
and
is
a
great
example
of
an
american
black
ipa
o
a
tasty
american
black
ale
blindfolded
i
might
think
this
was
a
stone
offering
due
to
the
combination
of
flavors
very
enjoyable
this
is
very
nice
great
hoppiness
balanced
of
toasted
malt
overall
another
stellar
lagunitas
offering
i
was
a
bit
let
down
but
this
is
such
a
great
value
that
its
like
nitpicking
a
first
round
draft
pick
d
this
was
a
great
black
ipa
it
smelled
fantastic
nearly
on
par
with
sucks
or
enjoy
by
the
taste
was
more
roasty
and
balanced
the
body
was
nice
and
slick
and
the
finish
was
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
im
loving
this
brew
well
done
lagunitas
overall
i
would
buy
this
again
it
drinks
just
as
good
as
their
weizenbock
another
great
bomber
cheap
as
all
hell
too
overall
ive
had
a
fair
amount
of
black
ipas
in
my
day
and
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorites
so
far
great
nose
and
good
balance
between
hops
and
dark
malts
in
the
flavor
i
rarely
say
anything
negative
about
lagunitas
and
this
is
very
much
the
same
the
only
gripe
i
have
is
that
its
too
carbonated
but
thats
a
small
one
great
brew
and
highly
recommended
for
the
style
cheers
not
everyone
enjoys
cascadian
darks
and
i
can
respect
that
but
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
happen
to
enjoy
well
made
cdas
and
this
certainly
fits
that
bill
i
encourage
even
those
who
are
typically
a
little
more
skeptical
of
the
style
to
give
this
one
a
try
i
think
lagunitas
once
again
demonstrated
their
brewing
prowess
with
this
one
overall
great
black
ale
very
smooth
for
such
a
hoppy
brew
recommended
for
all
hop
heads
overall
usually
i
am
a
fan
of
lagunitas
hoppier
and
stronger
ales
but
not
necessarily
their
dark
ales
this
one
bridges
the
gap
its
damn
drinkable
to
me
medium
body
with
a
very
smooth
carbonation
that
makes
the
beer
feel
like
its
on
nitro
nice
balance
of
hops
with
just
a
touch
of
the
dark
malts
which
is
to
my
liking
best
black
ipa
ever
love
it
really
surprised
at
how
much
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
hoppier
than
i
thought
but
that
was
the
best
part
would
definitely
have
it
again
o
awesome
american
dark
ale
or
whatever
the
hell
the
style
is
called
does
a
stellar
job
of
blending
the
best
aspects
of
hoppy
and
dark
not
quite
as
nuanced
as
wookey
jack
but
its
also
30
cheaper
in
my
area
seriously
this
bomber
cost
me
less
then
5
bucks
such
a
steal
pick
this
up
if
you
find
it
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
d
a
solid
rendition
of
the
style
although
not
particularly
stand
out
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
surprised
lags
took
this
long
to
come
out
with
a
black
ipa
does
have
some
nice
juicy
hop
flavors
and
it
is
definitely
hard
to
beat
at
the
lagunitas
price
point
not
my
favorite
black
ipa
but
will
be
revisiting
this
one
over
and
over
i
am
sure
of
it
o
an
exceptionally
solid
and
well
made
beer
easy
to
drink
still
i
find
myself
enjoying
it
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
if
i
could
get
it
fresh
all
the
time
it
would
be
a
goto
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
chewy
but
not
sticky
or
oppressive
this
is
a
pretty
darn
special
beer
now
i
wish
id
gotten
more
than
one
o
easily
a
top
3
black
ipa
for
me
a
lot
of
times
i
feel
the
ipa
qualities
are
trying
to
be
louder
than
the
porter
like
qualities
that
is
not
the
case
here
wish
i
had
this
blind
for
the
first
time
mouthfeel
is
amazing
o
a
stellar
american
dark
ale
roastforward
well
balanced
complex
and
delicious
overall
it
misses
some
of
the
classic
chocolate
and
coffee
angles
with
perhaps
some
mellow
hop
notes
but
it
still
delivers
easily
very
easy
drinking
even
at
8
2
abv
overall
a
very
good
dark
hoppy
beer
black
ipa
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
two
fingers
thick
creamy
tan
colored
foam
spray
of
lace
down
the
glass
smell
light
roast
and
brown

lots
of
grapefruit
mildly

soft

taste
grapefruit
pine
dried
tropical

light

and
toffee
notes
in
the

very
nice
overall
a
wonderful
beer
and
extension
of
ipa
hop
profiles
to
different
malts
m
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
medium
bodied
but
on
the
lighter
side
especially
when
cold
the
carbonation
bubbles
burst
pleasantly
rather
than
flowed
smoothly
and
the
experience
was
delightfully
full
of
flavor
explosions
that
clung
to
the
inside
of
my
mouth
so
enjoyable
overall
blindfolded
youd
be
very
hard
pressed
to
pick
up
the
black
characteristics
of
this
fine
black
ale
i
would
guess
this
was
a
dipa
personally
but
knowing
that
this
is
a
black
ale
you
search
for
the
slight
roast
and
licorice
and
you
find
it
and
rather
than
thinking
of
this
as
a
black
ale
i
find
his
to
be
an
even
more
complex
dipa
just
great
stuff
here
and
a
must
try
if
you
find
it
really
good
probably
the
best
sample
from
lagunitas
ive
had
and
they
generally
do
good
work
the
beer
poured
a
deep
brown
to
black
with
slight
ruby
highlights
and
loads
of
fluffy
tan
head
the
nose
is
very
hop
forward
with
grapefruit
rind
being
the
predominant
aroma
with
slight
hints
of
pine
and
mango
there
was
very
little
roast
on
the
nose
and
it
only
revealed
itself
as
it
warmed
if
i
wasnt
looking
at
this
dark
as
night
brew
i
would
swear
it
was
an
ipa
on
aroma
alone
the
taste
followed
with
strong
grapefruit
rind
and
a
little
more
of
the
pine
and
mango
notes
than
the
aroma
as
it
warmed
the
dark
roasted
malts
came
through
at
the
end
and
mingled
with
the
hops
to
create
a
beautiful
bitterness
on
my
palate
this
was
an
outstanding
black
ipa
and
lagunitas
handled
the
hops
expertly
o
better
than
expected
because
it
wasnt
overly
malty
or
roasted
definitely
a
hop
bomb
of
a
black
ipa
could
have
been
richer
but
really
good
overall
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
somewhat
creamy
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
nice
american
black
ale
which
i
would
drink
again
pours
a
black
body
with
two
finger
head
that
died
quick
and
left
some
sticky
lace
patches
around
glass
first
thing
that
hits
me
in
the
aroma
is
wet
citric
hops
and
then
a
burst
roasted
malts
even
a
little
bready
with
some
minor
chocolaty
sweetness
the
sweetness
seems
to
disappear
in
the
taste
as
this
mediumbodied
and
smooth
beer
slightly
filling
with
a
little
breadlike
note
is
mostly
roasted
malts
and
citric
hops
finishes
dry
and
a
little
boozy
the
balance
is
there
but
its
more
roasted
malts
and
hops
than
anything
else
and
not
too
much
else
in
the
flavor
department
not
bad
but
just
wish
for
a
little
bit
more
pours

very
nice
dark

very
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice

which
leaves
some
islands
and
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
very
nice
hop
notes
slight
licorice
the
taste
is
very
nice
malty
hoppy
medium

with
a
slight

finish
abv
hidden
very
well
overall
another
very
tasty
brew
from
lagunitas
well
done
would
recommend
o
very
unique
and
not
in
the
bad
way
that
beers
can
be
unique
very
straightforward
flavors
of
roast
and
hops
that
are
well
blended
too
bad
all
black
ipas
cant
be
this
good
between
this
and
wookey
jack
we
have
some
benchmarks
but
with
the
4
59
pricetag
for
a
bomber
we
have
a
winner
lean
and
clean
in
its
hopping
definitely
of
the
black
in
color
only
school
of
black
ipas
distinguished
by
its
soft
texture
but
not
sure
this
is
doing
much
that
say
blacks
of
kinsale
dont
do
very
nice
if
not
very
innovative
and
not
as
craveable
as
other
lagunitas
beers
nice
head
on
this
one
poured
it
into
an
english

slowly

the
nice
thin

staying
consistent
with
every
sip
peach
citrus
piney
aromas
coffee
some
roasted
nuttiness
hopspine
flavors
a
nice
lingering

bitterness
the
beer
screams
hopz
and
they
are
definitely
there
a
well
balanced
beer
that
finishes
somewhat
dry
with
slight
booziness

the

brew
with

thick

the
aroma
was
simple
and
a
little
hops
forward
so
it
covered
most
anything
else
which
was
a
little
offsetting
with
the
first
taste
the
hops
jump
up
and
show
a
strong
dominance
which
last
throughout
the
tasting
most
of
the
roasted
notes
appear
in
the
aftertaste
between
sips
and
still
becomes
mixed
into
the
hops
still
it
has
something
that
really
works

this
bomber
was
purchased
at
the
hennessey
grocery
in
butte
montana
for
6
xx
in
my
town
this
beer
represents
some
needed
variety
in
fact
only
one
store
carries
it
so
far
as
i
know
or
possibly
two
though
i
havent
checked
o
i
was
quite
impressed
by
this
one
especially
considering
the
low
price
4

i
believe
with
an
additional
20
off
at
central
market
this
is
definitely
one
i
will
be
getting
again
overall
its
very
inyourface
get
it
for
when
you
want
a
really
really
hoppy
cda
night
time
in
fall
when
it
just
starts
getting
cool
is
probably
good
for
this
one
however
if
your
plan
is
to
mow
the
lawn
in
summer
pick
a
different

would
love
to

this
in

at

reasonable

price
point
id
buy
plenty
incredible
beer
if
you
closed
your
eyes
and
just
took
an
initial
smell
and
taste
you
would
swear
this
is
just
another
lagunitas
ipa
but
then
night
time
takes
over
with
fresh
hops
warm
and
creamy
aroma
and
a
perfect
finish
somehow
you
feel
like
youre
drinking
hops
and
a

together
sounds
weird
tastes
amazing
everything
about

works

definitely
better
american

out
there
in
my
opinion
overall
the
brew
looks
and
smells
fantastic
but
the
beginning
of
the
taste
and
the
mouthfeel
were
kind
of
off
at
times
a
decent
brew
but
really
not
all
that
outstanding
overall
new
lagunitas
brew
and
fortunately
it
doesnt
take
long
to
hit

hey
we
grow

look
it
up

we
get
to

it

are
somehow
delivered
in
a
fashion
that
does
not
completely
squash
more
subtle

and
dark

wonderful
overall
i
love
this
style
and
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
lagunitas
never
seems
to
disappoint
and
this
is
no
exception
an
excellent
beer
o
my
first
of
this
style
and
a
good
one
the

combo
is
better
than
i

and
zero
cloying

medium

with
a
smooth

and
lightly
chalky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
only
a
slight

present
after

overall
this
is
an
excellent

all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
bright
citrusgrassy
hops
and
moderate
roasted
malt
flavor
and
very
smooth
to
drink
for
the
abv
a
very
enjoyable
offering
ive
been
falling
more
towards
the
lagunitas
brews
and
this
is
one
more
reason
why
overall
really
tasty
very
smooth
flavorful
and
easy
to
enjoy
this
is
how
a
black
ipa
should
taste
tropical
fruity
hops
with
the
malts
and
cocoa
coffee
backbone
balance
is
amazing
as
is
the
really
affordable
price
this
is
a
new
beer
of
the
year
candidate
so
far
easily
one
of
my
top
black
ipas
this
is
right
up
there
with
wookey
jack
another
great
beer
for
lagunitas
fans
o
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
coffee
flavor
plays
well
with
bitter
hops
o
being
a
relatively
new
style
i
imagine
we
will
see
more
exploration
in
this
area
moving
forward
while
this
did
not
impress
me
as
much
as
ssr
not
quite
as
sweet
it
is
a
solid
offering
especially
for
those
who
like
hop
forward
efforts
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
hoppy
up
front
with
a
great
dark
malt
backbone
that
gives
the
brew
a
nice
mix
of
porter
notes
with
some
good
strong
hop
kicks
pours
dark
but
not
opaque
nice
lacing
nose
was
very
strong
fruits
at
first
but
as
usual
calms
down
fairly
soon
flavor
brings
mild
fruit
with
some
hop
spice
the
sweet
edge
that
i
find
a
lot
of
black
ales
have
is
also
here
nothing
obnoxious
but
it
is
clearly
defined
i
would
hope
that
at
this
point
in
the
game
lagunitas
knows
how
to
deliver
i
this
style
and
they
have
with
this
one
o
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
this
style
because
most
of
the
time
they
are
roast
first
and
hops
second
what
ive
come
to
realize
is
that
the
key
to
this
style
is
to
drink
them
as
fresh
as
possible
this
is
almost
a
month
old
and
has
kept
its
hop
character
nicely
my
favorite
of
the
style
has
been
founders
inspired
artist
and
the
roast
in
that
started
to
take
over
more
quickly
than
this
one
really
happy
with
this
beer
and
hope
lagunitas
releases
it
a
couple
of
times
a
year
because
great
black
ipas
are
hard
to
find
overall
an
excellent
black
ipa
i
hope
to
see
it
in
six
packs
some
day
overall
it
is
hard
to
express
how
excited
we
were
for
this
beer
lagunitas
produces
some
of
our
alltime
favorite
hoppy
beers
and
as
big
fans
of
black
ipasales
we
couldnt
hardly
wait
the
result
is
a
wonderful
black
ale
with
nearly
superfluous
hoppiness
at
certain
points
and
especially
with
warmth
the
hop
profile
actually
reminded
us
somewhat
of
heady
in
all
of
the
fruitiness
and
cloying
sweetness
with
bitterness
only
developing
on
the
deep
aftertaste
that
said
there
is
not
really
much
bitterness
to
speak
of
and
the
beer
develops
and
warms
to
fit
your
palate
and
your
taste
buds
the
black
part
of
the
beer
is
there
as
well
giving
smoke
and
a
pseudo
meatiness
to
it
helping
to
quell
the
frank
sweetness
its
up
against
we
urge
lagunitas
to
make
this
year
round
as
it
is
premier
for
its
style
o
this
is
just
a
great
beer
and
phenomenal
for
the
price
nailed
the
style
down
it
might
not
be
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
but
it
might
certainly
be
my
favorite
a
choice
cascadian
black
ale
highly
recommended
a
nice
black
ipa
but
a
touch
on
the
bitter
side
this
is
a
good
beer
but
when
it
comes
to
black
ipas
i
would
rather
go
with
founders
or
heavy
seas
dark
chestnut
brown
with
a
deep
red
tint
translucent
when
held
to
the
light
pours
with
a
gigantic
23
inch
tan
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
close
to
a
1
finger
uneven
head
lasted
most
of
the
time
i
was
drinking
this
beer
with
lots
of
rich
foam
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
wonderful
sweet
hoppy
aroma
that
persisted
and
made
me
want
to
drink
the
contents
of
my
glass
smooth
start
with
hints
of
grain
ever
so
slightly
sweet
progressing
to
a
justright
hoppy
flavor
with
a
slight
dry
finish
i
found
the
flavor
somewhat
complex
delicious
and
thirstquenching
smooth
velvety
and
a
medium
body
overall
i
loved
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
overall
im
happy
ive
still
got
half
a
bottle
to
kill
the
taste
is
slightly
more
balanced
than
the
smell
but
this
is
still
a
hop
heavy
beer
surprisingly
the
nearburnt
malts
show
up
in
the
swallow
which
creates
a
reasonably
wellbalanced
aftertaste
the
body
is
slightly
rich
and
the
effervescence
is
elevated
an
interesting
beer
that
will
make
the
treasure
seekers
drool
but
might
not
be
a
go
to
beer
for
many
overall
an
easy
drinking
flavorful
beer
another
quality
beer
from
lagunitas
that
you
should
seek
out
and
try
poured
ontap
into
a
snifter
pours
reddish
black
with
a
small
off
white
head
smells
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
tastes
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
not
much
malt
beer
starts
light
bodied
but
finishes
a
bit
thicker
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
very
good
flavorful
ale
with
an
excellent
hop
profile
one
of
my
favorites
from
lagunitas
already
definitely
worth
trying
this
is
exactly
what
i
like
in
a
black
ipa
hopforward
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
really
highlighting
the
hop
blend
but
with
a
smooth
creamy
chocolatey
malt
backbone
to
give
it
just
a
little
something
different
exceptionally
well
made
ale
a
decent
enough
rendition
of
an
aba
the
biggish
abv
quite
well
integrated
and
the
expected
char
kept
on
the
downlow
for
the
most
part
so
what
are
we
then
left
with
oh
i
dunno
just
that
typical
lagunitas
hop
and
malt
braggadocio
you
bet
your
ass
and
its
absolutely
fine
by
this
sports
fan
so
keep
em
coming
is
all
i
can
ask
better
served
at
colder
temps
as
recommended
overall
i
love
this
beer
right
there
with
sublimely
and
wookie
maybe
even
better
overall
this
beer
completely
blew
me
away
at
first
appearance
my
assumption
was
that
this
would
be
a
sweet
malty
brew
but
nope
this
one
is
a
keeper
this
is
an
awesome
black
ipa
they
nailed
it
its
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
ive
had
this
is
exactly
what
i
expected
from
lagunitas
and
they
delivered
highly
recommended
not
too
familiar
with
black
ipas
or
what
have
you
but
this
is
pretty
damn
good
overall
it
is
certainly
a
solid
double
black
ipa
at
an
exceptional
price
not
sure
if
its
the
licorice
like
flavor
but
something
holds
it
back
from
being
phenomenal
o
something
fans
of
the
style
would
really
dig
as
a
casual
drinker
of
black
ales
it
was
an
enjoyable
ale
but
didnt
do
anything
to
pull
ahead
of
my
top
ales
in
the
style
that
said
for
fans
or
the
average
ba
id
recommend
a
buy
has
a
lot
of
quality
american
black
ale
characteristics
i
recall
whining
about
no
double
bipa
listed
as
a
style
not
that
long
ago
not
sure
where
we
draw
the
line
anyways
bad
ass
from
start
to
finish
just
beautiful
liquid
overall
a
wellrounded
black
ipa
by
lagunitas
i
would
have
like
to
see
the
hops
be
more
prevalent
in
this
brew
but
the
roasted
malts
that
dominated
more
so
were
quite
nice
tasty
go
get
some
i
think
this
one
would
go
well
with
a
nice
steak
or
with
a
chocolate
dessert
overall
pretty
awesome
black
ale
even
though
their
hop
flavors
seem
the
same
or
slightly
different
from
beer
to
beer
the
use
of
different
malts
sets
them
apart
i
still
drink
them
all
and
love
the
short
availability
of
each
style
o
when
you
hear
black
ale
a
little
heavy
on
the
anise
flavor
basically
opaque
beer
with
a
a
creamy
medium
sized
tan
colored
head
lace
is
spotty
aroma
is
a
plethora
of
fruity
grapefruit
slightly
syrupy
herbal
dankness
flavor
is
a
blast
of
fruit
and
pine
pineapple
only
behind
wookey
jack
not
surprisingly
and
citrus
there
is
also
a
nice
roasted
malt
undertone
with
hints
of
coffee
and
chocolate
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy

there
are
minor
differences
in
each
this
is
another
delicious
beer
by
firestone
walker
a
darker
style
ipa
with
some
subtle
rye
pepperiness
but
candidly
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
think
most
would
just
call
it
a
near
perfect
ipa
i
love
the
look
in
the
glass
and
even
better
in
my
mouth
these
brewers
have
established
themselves
as
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
all
their
beers
check
the
dates
and
get
them
as
fresh
as
possible
credit
to
the
brewers
for
making
the
dating
so
clear
and
straightforward
it
makes
a
difference
imo
was
a
bit
harsh
to
me
this
isnt
a
hoppy
beer
but
you
can
still
tell
its
an
ipa
drinks
like
a
stout
with
the
bittered
finish
of
an
ipa
these
black
ipas
arent
one
of
my
favorite
styles
because
i
feel
like
so
many
breweries
try
to
lean
to
one
side
this
one
is
a
perfect
blend
of
hopspinefruit
and
maltchocolate
o
a
very
drinkable
american
black
ale
this
beer
is
my
all
time
favorite
great
taste
with
the
hops
and
rye
simply

a

overall
this
is
the
second
fw
beer
iv
had
the
first
being
union
jack
both
being
around
8
months
since
bottling
of
course
the
hops
in
union
jack
had
already
fallen
off
and
ended
up
with
a
malty
mess
but
i
thought
wookey
would
hold
up
a
little
better
i
suppose
the
hops
in
here
fell
off
too
and
was
left
with
a
semi
hoppy
black
ipa
as
it
warms
i
get
little
hints
of
what
i
imagine
it
is
like
fresh
i
like
how
the
flavors
linger
on
the
pallet
for
a
while
as
is
i
enjoyed
lagunitas
nighttime
much
more
than
this
ill
seek
out
a
not
so
hoppy
fw
beer
next
time
since
i
cant
get
their
beers
fresh
lots
of
hop
aroma
with
a
well
balanced

taste
outstanding
i
really
liked
this
beer
nice

a

with

minimal

taste
was

considering

felt

would
like
to
try
this
beer
fresher
i
am
drinking
it
on
the
last
day
of
its
best
by
date
i
wonder
if
that
has
something
to
do
with
the
muted
taste
it
is
not
my
favorite
beer
but
it
is
a
well
done
beer
im
not
that
big
of
a
fan
of
black
or
rye
ipas
that
ive
tried
but
wookey
jack
is
making
me
reconsider
that
belief
smells
great
good
citrus
hops
tastes
great
good
hoppy
taste
needing
just
a
bit
more
rye
for
my
taste
leaves
a
slight
after
taste
but
not
an
offensive
one
overall
out
of
ten
i
give
it
a
solid
9
5
with
the
lack
of
rye
being
the
main
reason
it
isnt
higher
this
is
a
big
well
balanced
smooth
beer
smells
of
hops
pine
and
chocolate
nice
butter
mouth
feel
tastes
like
a
hoppy
chocolate
porter
a
great
beer
definitely
an
acquired
taste
i
usually
dont
enjoy
these
types
of
beers
but
this
one
was
so
smooth
and
tasty
has
a
very
robust
flavor
black
only
letting
a
little
redness
show
through
smells
overwhelmingly
like
an
ipa
citrusy
piney
notes
with
a
little
roastiness
behind
it
this
tastes
good
floral
and
pine
like
hops
leave
a
medium
bitterness
and
then
there
is
kind
of
a
roasted
aftertaste
nice
mouthfeel
on
this
very
good
black
ipa
overall
if
you
believe
that
some
is
good
and
more
is
better
youre
going
to
love
this
beer
firestone
tells
us
that
wookey
jack
is
a
black
rye
ipa
i
would
have
guessed
a
hoppy
california
porter
regardless
this
is
one
big
tasty
ale
overal
very
good
conversation
drink
overall
a
great
beer
to
me
it
has
more
of
a
sour
finish
rather
than
bitter
and
was
what
i
enjoyed
most
opaque
black
pour
from
large
format
bottle
fantastic
mixture
of
rye
sourness
hops
on
both
the
aroma
taste
not
a
very
heavy
mouthfeel
but
really
smooth
i
would
have
wished
for
a
tiny
bit
more
bitterness
but
im
not
complaining
this
is
fine
beer
o
fantastic
stuff
similar
but
completely
different
then
the
other
black
ipas
unique
and
worth
exploring
begins
to
blur
the
line
between
ipas
and
porters
pours
a
dark
black
with
hints
of
red
and
brown
with
a
creamy
coffee
color
head
that
has
great
lacing
and
retention
aroma
is
amazing
packed
with
citrus
fruit
and
hops
taste
is
great
with
the
citrus
fruit
being
balanced
by
roasted
malts
and
a
quick
hit
of
spice
from
the
rye
overall
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
although
i
would
like
a
little
more
bitterness
which
is
why
it
isnt
rated
a
5
great
beer
love
this
stuff
color
is
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
tan
head
good
retention
and
creamy
semisticky
lacing
aroma
is
good
lots
of
roasted
malt
citrus
and
some
rye
flavor
follows
the
nose
along
with
some
coffee
notes
finish
is
mildly
bitter
and
dry
body
is
medium
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
really
rich
and
chewy
every
sip
feels
almost
like
a
bite
actually
rye
shines
hops
are
rough
but
with
that
nice
crisp
citrus
edge
even
extra
fruity
goodness
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
ever
had
overall
really
good
very
different
black
ipa
love
the
rye
in
it
favorite
black
ipa
if
someone
knows
a
better
one
let
me
know
this
one
is
the
top
until
then
o
wow
is
this
good
this
one
is
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
good
black
rye
ipa
buy
again
overall
i
typically
do
not
like
dark
ipa
this
is
an
exception
not
a
lot
of
roast
no
harsh
bitterness
from
the
dark
grain
will
buy
again
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
light
tan
head
smells
mostly
of
pine
and
roast
malt
with
some
light
citrus
the
taste
is
dominated
by
pine
roasted
malts
a
little
mocha
rye
medium
body
and
med
carbonation
aftertaste
is
dominated
by
piny
hop
resin
very
tasty
has
the
nose
of
stone
ipa
for
me
2
months
or
younger
sublime
older
than
3
months
great
ipa
younger
is
definitely
much
better
overall
quite
an
outstanding
brew
the
rye
makes
an
excellent
addition
looks
darker
than
it
is
one
of
my
most
favorite
black
ipas
so
smooth
just
a
great
black
ipa
all
the
jack
line
from
fw
is
great
great
black
rye
ipa
hop
aroma
up
front
followed
by
great
coffee
taste
that
ends
with
the
dryness
of
rye
the
blend
of
dry
from
hops
and
rye
with
the
sensuousness
of
the
coffeemalt
in
the
middle
make
this
top
of
the
charts
in
this
category
imbibed
at
burger
bar
in
las
vegas
o
very
nice
black
ipa
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
of
beer
in
general
but
so
far
this
one
has
done
what
i
feel
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
as
a
discrete
entity
o
there
are
a
number
things
going
on
here
and
they
all
seem
perfectly
balanced
an
inviting
smell
some
pretty
disparate
tastes
that
somehow
pull
together
wonderfully
and
a
pleasing
look
this
one
is
a
winner
for
sure
more
spicy
rye
as
a
flavour
along
with
a
little
roast
some
piny
hops
followed
by
a
balanced
finish
serving
type
bottle
pours
black
with
a
decent
tan
head
and
minimal
lacing
clinging
for
dear
life
aroma
is
of
roast
chocolate
taste
is
ok
but
i
expected
a
little
more
for
all
the
hype
and
high
scores
that
i
see
for
this
beer
flavors
of
roasted
caramel
and
coffee
some
malt
sweetnessw
and
some
hops
come
through
for
the
most
part
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
but
the
hops
add
an
odd
bitterness
that
doesnt
balance
well
with
the
rest
of
the
brew
a
little
off
balanced
and
also
not
as
bold
as
i
was
anticipating
slightly
weak
and
some
of
the
complexity
that
should
be
there
is
gone
22
into
a
simple
pint
black
with
coppery
tones
and
a
tan
head
aroma
gives
the
spiciness
with
a
little
hop
and
malt
for
backing
the
flavor
is
a
bigger
version
of
the
aroma
the
spiciness
of
the
rye
gets
in
first
followed
by
some
of
the
hop
profiles
that
are
less
easy
for
me
to
peg
down
cant
claim
citrus
or
pine
as
dominant
definitely
not
floral
in
my
bottle
perhaps
rye
interference
maltiness
in
the
back
gives
it
a
balance
for
these
mediumtobig
flavors
alcohol
at
the
finish
is
subdued
which
i
did
not
expect
in
an
8
a
solid
black
ipa
effort
well
balanced
for
the
genre
overall
this
is
easier
drinking
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
expecting
something
like
union
jack
that
i
think
is
hoppier
and
has
more
bitterness
this
is
very
smooth
a
nice
citrusy
bitterness
up
front
a
little
roasted
character
on
the
back
end
but
surprisingly
very
drinkable
i
think
i
need
to
try
more
black
ales
ipas
to
get
a
better
understanding
of
where
this
fits
in
the
style
definitely
worth
drinking
again
and
worth
trying
yet
another
firestone
masterpiece
never
had
a
rye
ipa
this
good
and
i
have
had
some
really
amazing
ones
never
had
a
black
ipa
this
good
either
this
beer
is
the
best
of
both
worlds
good
job
firestone
yet
another
reason
you
are
my
favorite
brewing
company
overall
nice
beer
i
do
like
this
black
ale
black
ipa
whatever
they
want
to
call
it
style
it
blends
the
best
of
two
worlds
for
me
anyway
i
have
drank
a
few
but
kind
of
backed
away
while
summer
was
here
now
that
we
are
in
a
transitional
season
and
i
want
more
stouts
this
is
a
good
beer
to
bring
me
up
to
speed
i
recommend
it
if
you
can
find
it
its
a
good
price
and
a
very
solid
beer
that
is
a
superb
black
rye
ipa
original
bold
in
flavors
and
hops
80
ibus
and
still
very
drinkable
my
taste
buds
are
completely
soaked
recommendable
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
very
nicely
crafted
beer
nice
balance
of
hops
i
am
a
big
citra
fan
and
malts
yielding
a
very
well
concealed
8
3
abv
notes
of
grapefruit
mango
papaya
resin
and
fresh
cut
grass
are
countered
by
roasty
chocolatey
malt
in
the
aroma
fruity
hops
dominate
flavor
is
citrusy
initially
with
grassy
and
earthy
undertones
becoming
roasty
mid
palate
which
carries
into
a
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
grounds
bitterness
in
the
finish
again
flavoring
hops
especially
grapefruit
dominate
but
the
roast
bitterness
adds
an
interesting
contrast
excellent
beer
especially
for
6
bucks
a
bomber
notes
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
pine
serve
in
the
aftertaste
for
even
more
hop
character
dark
dark
dark
tasty
cinnamon
and
not
too
heavy
great
beer
o
if
chewbacca
could
speak
english
hed
toast
this
wookie
jack
for
days
a
damn
fine
brew
with
killer
balance
highly
recommended
overall
drinkability
a
slow
sipping
beer
to
my
surprise
i
only
wanted
one
of
these
and
i
was
done
perhaps
too
intense
in
bitterness
very
good
but
i
think
it
wrecked
my
palate
for
the
evening
went
well
enough
with
pulled
pork
bbq
but
wasnt
a
perfect
food
match
certainly
a
very
good
savoring
beer
just
not
a
beer
that
goes
well
with
smoked
bbq
perhaps
better
with
something
else
but
im
not
sure
what
4
wifes
reviewit
is
ok
overall
for
my
first
offering
from
firestone
they
deliver
a
solid
cascadian
the
aroma
could
of
been
a
little
more
pronounced
with
the
hops
as
i
found
it
to
be
more
malt
dominated
other
than
that
a
solid
cascadian
and
am
glad
to
have
finally
tried
a
firestone
offering
o
classy
and
delicious
great
pairing
with
roasted
chicken
dark
almost
black
color
from
a
draft
pour
3
fingers
of
head
dissipated
quickly
strong
hop
aroma
mild
and
balanced
in
the
mouth
loads
of
roasted
malts
citrus
some
rye
definitely
little
bitterness
but
hidden
very
complex
and
well
done
very
different
if
you
like
ipa
and
stout
this
tastes
like
a
good
marriage
of
both
overall
i
loved
this
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
thick
dark
color
rich
darkened
fluffy
head
which
lingers
overall
a
very
solid
offering
and
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
out
there
i
will
be
picking
this
up
again
perfect
black
ipa
overally
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
has
a
great
deal
of
balance
from
the
ingredients
playing
together
nicely
the
malt
could
taste
burnt
but
does
not
the
hops
could
have
a
stronger
catty
character
but
dont
linger
long
enough
to
become
unpleasant
on
the
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
which
ill
be
happy
to
have
again
in
the
future
while
the
hops
and
rye
were
muted
this
was
the
smoothest
ale
i
have
had
in
a
great
long
time
and
it
did
live
up
to
the
expectations
next
time
check
the
date
and
seek
a
fresh
one
o
black
ipa
has
a
lot
of
room
for
interpretation
and
i
feel
like
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
malty
fruity
bitter
and
complex
very
enjoyable
pours
a
nearblack
with
just
a
hint
of
brown
showing
where
light
manages
to
get
through
a
big
creamy
tan
head
hangs
on
a
long
time
eventually
settling
down
in
to
a
nice
disk
leaving
tight
soapy
lacing
the
aroma
is
lighter
with
light
roasted
malt
and
pine
hops
the
taste
though
kicks
it
into
a
higher
gear
with
roasted
malt
burnt
sugar
and
floral
and
fruit
hops
adding
to
the
pine
the
body
is
nice
and
smooth
with
just
a
little
bite
from
the
hops
on
the
finish
a
great
black
ale
black
in
color
with
almost
no
head
smell
is
malty
and
grassy
hops
thinner
mouth
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
boozy
hoppypiney
bitterness
with
hints
of
caramel
malt
rye
spice
and
chocolate
good
overall
but
was
hoping
for
more
based
on
reviews
and
my
own
enjoyment
of
both
union
jack
and
double
jack
overall
solid
black
ale
but
baranofs
is
better
t
starts
with
a
peppery
woody
note
moves
to
hops
pine
grapefruit
in
the
middle
along
with
something
like
whole
grain
bread
crust
finishes
with
a
coffeelike
bitterness
roastedness
and
mossyness
throughout
cheers
i
love
you
wookey
excellent
ale
an
amazing
creation
better
on
draft
than
a
bottle
as
it
looses
a
bit
of
texture
this
one
spoiled
me
for
other
ryes
and
ive
yet
to
find
its
equal
tons
of
flavor
not
one
for
the
novice
beer
drinker
yes
sir
my
favorite
dark
ipa
so
far
perhaps
the
best
black
ipa
ive
yet
to
have
this
has
all
the
elements
for
the
style
the
nose
is
very
fruity
with
tangerines
grapefruit
mangoes
oranges
and
lemon
but
a
light
char
and
piney
resin
all
come
together
the
flavor
is
fruity
as
well
with
tangerines
and
grapefruit
juice
oranges
and
lemon
the
backbone
is
a
sizeable
structure
of
malty
char
that
is
balanced
and
hefty
this
drinks
very
easy
for
its
abv
and
is
intensely
flavorful
overall
fantastic
this
beer
not
only
tasted
excellent
but
it
made
me
think
i
could
pilot
the
millennium
falcon
wookies
unite
overall
very
enjoyable
dont
know
how
it
taste
fresh
but
i
enjoyed
it
regardless
there
really
is
no
flaw
in
this
especially
did
not
expect
this
to
have
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
just
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
and
while
i
wouldnt
say
its
my
favorite
its
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
my
favorite
part
about
it
is
the
way
its
a
very
good
beer
when
its
a
little
older
and
the
hops
have
faded
but
its
just
a
fabulous
beer
when
the
hops
are
still
the
primary
element
of
the
beer
the
best
beers
all
do
thischange
over
time
without
becoming
something
uninteresting
o
seems
to
divide
opinion
it
mirrors
many
of
the
same
characteristics
as
a
few
other
marquee
examples
of
the
style
ive
tried
yakima
glory
for
one
i
suppose
what
makes
this
stand
out
is
how
delicate
and
dropoff
dry
it
becomes
merely
halfway
through
each
sip
maybe
a
little
too
kinda
like
the
pte
of
abas
ive
had
the
double
barrel
alethe
double
jack
and
now
the
wookey
jack
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
three
with
a
nice
8
30
abv
this
will
get
the
job
done
very
good
black
ale
i
have
liked
all
the
firestone
ales
i
have
tried
nice
color
and
very
nice
smell
too
it
i
will
be
buying
more
of
these
in
the
future
keep
on
pounding
the
brewsmotley
drunk
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
there
is
a
grapefruit
and
roasted
malt
aftertaste
a
nicely
made
american
black
ale
worth
trying
for
sure
nice
iba
good
hops
and
nice
roasty
characters
as
well
could
up
the
roast
on
the
nose
and
the
hops
on
the
front
palate
but
plenty
to
like
nonetheless
im
nitpicking
really
o
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
with
all
the
great
qualities
of
the
style
but
also
hitting
the
mark
of
differences
as
well
with
the
rye
and
spice
this
is
probably
the
most
drinkable
black
ipa
ive
had
and
one
ill
trade
for
again
when
its
time
it
actually
saddens
me
i
cant
have
this
at
my
fingertips
whenever
i
want
it
the
fw
quality
is
there
the
west
coast
style
as
well
but
the
roasted
rich
malt
and
rye
characters
throw
you
for
a
one
of
a
kind
experience
its
as
perfect
as
the
style
can
get
another
excellent
offering
from
fw
rich
and
creamy
full
of
flavor
and
aroma
o
im
becoming
a
firestone
walker
fanboy
this
is
a
high
quality
black
ipa
and
it
certainly
makes
me
understand
the
parabola
quest
that
everyone
seems
to
be
on
i
put
this
at
the
head
of
my
black
ipa
class
other
than
heddy
topper
which
ive
the
privelege
of
getting
my
hands
on
occasionally
wookey
jack
is
to
me
the
best
beer
in
the
world
ill
keep
searching
and
ive
got
a
long
journey
ahead
but
my
chewy
beer
has
set
the
bar
high
for
me
o
never
been
a
fan
of
black
ipasamerican
black
ales
honestly
this
is
one
of
the
better
representatives
of
the
style
to
me
it
just
seems
that
this
beer
cant
make
up
its
mind
although
that
creates
an
interesting
experience
the
overall
experience
is
a
potpourri
of
flavors
that
play
on
the
palate
like
a
hybrid
brown
aleporter
and
an
ipa
pretty
good
pretty
interesting
o
very
good
for
style
oim
still
new
to
rating
the
darker
stuff
and
am
more
comfortable
with
my
impressions
of
regular
ipas
however
i
definitely
enjoy
this
one
and
firestone
walker
never
seems
to
let
me
down
nice
green
hop
aroma
and
taste
balanced
by
some
roast
and
spiciness
from
the
malt
i
really
like
this
beer
and
highly
suggest
it
would
love
ot
have
one
fresher
but
this
is
still
amazing
mouthfeel
is
good
but
seemed
kind
of
sticky
to
me

if
session
beer
status
wookey
jack
is
a
delicious
beer
that
i
am
just
trying
today
for
the
first
time
i
expected
this
beer
would
be
good
because
well
it
is
a
firestone
walker
product
but
it
turned
out
even
better
than
my
already
high
expectations
would
have
dreamed
and
i
can
see
why
others
have
stated
that
this
beer
is
a
benchmark
for
the
black
ipa
style
its
beautiful
appearance
rocky
head
of
foam
full
bodied
complex
taste
and
just
about
everything
else
point
to
a
beer
made
for
victory
in
a
critics
taste
competition
its
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
tried
of
this
style
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
everyone
all
in
all
this
is
a
great
beer
black
ipas
are
getting
a
bad
rap
lately
on
this
site
but
this
is
an
example
of
the
craftsmanship
that
can
really
elevate
the
style
to
something
elegant
all
around
great
beer
o
this
is
a
well
crafted
black
ipa
and
deserved
the
praise
that
it
receives
the
flavors
balance
perfectly
with
a
full
mouthfeel
of
a
stout
overall
a
great
benchmark
for
the
black
aleipa
category
a
big
bad
beast
of
a
beer
but
has
so
much
integrity
you
simply
cant
deny
it
this
beer
reminds
me
of
myself
in
some
ways
the
hops
are
more
pungent
in
the
taste
but
not
to
the
point
of
being
too
bitter
they
are
the
leading
characteristic
on
first
sip
to
the
lingering
bitter
finish
yet
at
he
same
time
it
has
a
milder
dose
of
dark
malts
rye
and
creaminess
altogether
this
is
a
near
perfect
blend
of
all
the
good
things
we
want
in
a
brew
excellent
firestone
walker
describes
this
beer
as
an
ipa
for
dark
beer
fans
and
i
completey
agree
i
tend
to
prefer
maltier
beers
in
general
but
i
found
this
brew
to
be
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malts
for
a
fairly
smooth
easy
drinking
choice
the
pepper
was
noticeable
as
was
the
hint
of
rye
neither
were
overwhelming
but
made
for
a
unique
taste
poured
from
650
ml
bomber
into
a
liefmans
goudenband
glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
on
5232014
pours
dark
black
looks
like
a
russian
imperial
save
for
the
off
white
not
brown
head
light
foam
nothing
notable
smell
is
a
hoppy
but
not
at
first
sneaks
up
on
you
with
a
smell
of
wood
and
cigar
to
a
light
citrus
floral
maybe
aroma
hard
to
detect
subtle
but
really
unique
smell
taste
follows
up
with
the
aroma
definitely
tastes
smoky
and
stoutlike
when
it
first
hits
the
lips
but
as
it
moves
through
the
palate
i
get
flavors
of
maple
pine
mild
citrus
and
honestly
cough
syrup
not
in
a
bad
way
just
the
easiest
way
to
describe
this
fruity
flavor
i
get
thats
hard
to
detect
mouthfeel
is
thick
love
the
unfiltered
style
for
an
ipa
definitely
digging
this
style
more
and
more
with
every
beer
i
try
once
again
fsw
fails
to
disappoint
ps
paired
this
with
locally
smoked
bratwurst
a
win
there
too
o
this
is
one
hell
of
a
beer
the
rye
makes
it
special
and
helps
balance
it
out
a
very
dark
black
pour
with
gobs
of
lacing
melding
on
the
glass
and
thick
foam
retention
spice
rye
is
prominent
strong
roasted
coffee
with
nuttiness
grainy
coffee
bitterness
felt
at
the
end
smooth
and
robust
at
the
same
time
o
excellent
brew
many
different
favors
that
work
together
better
than
mist
regular
ipa
or
dipa
rye
comes
through
in
a
way
similar
to
sucks
but
that
burnt
taste
really
caps
it
off
overall
really
perfect
for
a
cda
i
mean
i
dont
really
have
any
faults
with
this
beer
you
can
tell
it
is
made
of
good
stuff
and
it
isnt
so
lopsided
with
either
the
maltalcohol
or
hop
bitterness
i
could
see
anyone
who
enjoys
bitter
beers
but
isnt
a
total
hophead
convert
to
like
this
treat
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
very
enjoyable
i
highly
recommend
this
one
a
good
drinking

and
spot

my

is
medium
thick
not
quite
chewy
overall
the
is
an
outstanding
black
ipa
a
style
i
am
not
familiar
with
o
what
great
balance
achieved
with
such
an
ambitious
recipe
the
rye
pairs
so
well
with
the
roasted
malt
the
hops
work
just
enough
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
o
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
but
i
am
not
sure
i
will
seek
it
out
again
it
is
a
nice
brew
but
if
i
am
getting
something
in
this
style
i
prefer
southern

wookey
jack
came
in
8th
in
my
recent
8
beer
tasting
of
firestone
walkers
top
beers
out
of
the
seven
ba
guys
we
had
at
the
tasting
wookey
jack
got
the
poorest
reviews
with
an
average
review
score
of
3
78
unfortunately
this
beer
was
about
2
years
old
and
was
too
old
to
properly
judge
it
should
have
been
a
lot
fresher
in
all
fairness
ive
had
this
on
and
off
in
the
past
few
years
but
lately
been
craving
back
for
this
a
spectacular
all
year
round
craft
im
sure
black
ales
are
tough
but
this
has
been
nailed
really
cant
say
enough
fine
things
opinion
i
really
like
this
beer
its
very
complex
yet
moderately
sessionable
in
spite
of
the
fact
of
the
8
5
abv
im
currently
cellaring
one
and
will
probably
do
more
overall
nice
beer
with
good
balance
and
complexity
its
a
bit
astringent
and
has
more
roast
than
i
like
for
style
o
i
was
not
expecting
this
beer
to
beat
out
double
jack
but
everytjing
about
this
is
good
havent
had
very
many
rye
ipa
but
i
will
definitely
have
to
try
more
of
these
o
a
good
beer
but
confusing
it
seems
to
fall
a
bit
short
of
what
the
concept
and
appearance
promises
very
drinkable
though
overall
a
great
dipa
that
would
be
hard
to
pick
out
as
a
black
ipa
if
not
for
looking
at
it
hides
the
alcohol
well
and
the
bitterness
level
is
pleasant
o
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
would
think
it
might
be
tasty
from
the
tap
prost
very
dark
black
in
color
but
you
can
still
see
just
a
slight
bit
of
light
gets
through
when
held
up
to
a
light
brussels
lacing
a
thin
layer
of
khaki
colored
foam
covers
the
top
perhaps
not
quite
a
quarter
of
an
inch
aroma
of
rye
and
pine
like
hops
is
very
prevalent
and
beckons
for
a
sip
the
flavor
is
initially
very
bitter
from
the
pine
like
northwest
hops
but
then
quickly
segues
into
the
spicy
earthy
rye
flavor
the
mouth
is
silky
and
deceptively
smooth
this
is
a
hard
review
to
write
i
keep
trying
this
cause
i
want
to
like
it
though
i
keep
being
let
down
certainly
a
standard
for
this
style
if
that
is
your
thing
i
have
never
been
a
fan
with
the
clash
of
hops
and
big
malts
after
many
tries
this
is
obviously
not
for
me
this
is
a
must
try
beer
i
will
be
buying
this
more
often
now
that
i
think
of
it
rules
when
significant
snow
likely
to
give
you
time
to
consume
large
quantities
of
birra
is
forecast
buy
some
up
and
post
em
up
hats
off
to
firestone
well
done
poured
from
bottle
into
snifter
three
finger
tan
head
slowly
faded
to
a
thin
rim
nose
is
a
blend
of
hops
roasted
malts
and
rye
first
taste
is
very
roasty
with
a
decent
hoppy
bitterness
towards
the
end
that
lingers
it
has
a
medium
mouth
feel
and
the
rye
is
present
throughout
with
a
solid
amount
of
rye
hanging
around
after
every
sip
very
drinkable
hardly
notice
the
8
3
overall
this
is
my
first
black
ale
which
really
appeals
to
me
as
it
combines
the
flavor
profiles
of
two
of
my
favorites
styles
the
finish
on
this
beer
is
amazing
i
find
myself
savoring
both
flavors
of
a
stout
and
ipa
well
after
ive
finish
the
swig
if
you
are
a
fan
of
both
ipas
and
stouts
get
this
dont
procrastinate
like
i
did
just
get
it
and
dwell
in
its
tastiness
o
the
rye
adds
a
nice
touch
to
the
black
aleblack
ipa
style
this
was
my
introduction
to
said
style
and
i
didnt
quite
get
it
yet
if
i
try
it
again
i
might
like
it
more
o
this
was
one
of
those
i
know
is
a
well
crafted
beer
but
i
just
cant
dig
it
the
aromas
were
heavenly
but
the
taste
ended
far
too
burned
and
bitter
for
my
palate
i
dont
think
i
can
recall
a
beers
taste
deviating
so
drastically
from
its
smell
which
is
really
an
accomplishment
i
suppose
huge
flavors
nice
complexity
just
not
my
style
o
black
ipas
are
not
a
popular
choice
for
me
but
i
certainly
have
tried
a
fair
amount
of
them
this
one
stands
out
for
its
balance
and
integration
of
flavors
when
you
have
dark
malt
big
hoppy
aromas
and
bitterness
as
well
as
some
dry
spicy
rye
it
can
be
difficult
to
keep
everything
in
check
you
can
see
how
this
could
become
a
tug
o
war
event
on
your
palate
with
each
flavor
fighting
to
overpower
the
others
however
this
beer
was
not
the
case
everyone
played
well
in
the
sandbox
that
being
said
i
recommend
stouts
dogfish
head
world
wide
stout
is
awesome
top
notch
beer
here
folks
pick
some
up
asap
the
beer
pours
a
foamy
head
head
that
is
a
milk
chocolate
brown
that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
the
beer
itself
appears
to
be
a
jet
black
but
under
further
inspection
is
actually
a
very
dark
brown
the
beer
smell
is
a
mix
between
the
hops
rye
and
malt
the
rye
is
the
strongest
of
the
three
and
is
bolstered
by
the
hops
the
malts
give
a
hint
of
roastness
to
the
smell
but
is
very
small
the
beer
taste
is
pretty
good
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
rye
spice
malt
and
hops
the
hops
have
a
bitter
citrus
taste
while
the
malts
provide
a
nice
roasted
flavor
to
the
mix
after
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
the
beer
also
has
a
slight
caramel
flavor
the
rye
spice
mixes
very
well
and
its
funk
compliments
the
hops
but
does
not
overcome
it
the
mouthfeel
is
interesting
the
beer
is
mediumbodied
and
thicker
than
an
average
ipa
the
feel
is
slightly
creamy
biting
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
rye
ipa
and
worth
getting
i
can
certainly
see
why
its
high
on
most
peoples
list
this
brew
pours
jet
black
with
a
small
tan
head
nice
aroma
dominated
by
american
hops
with
a
burnt
malty
backdrop
the
taste
on
this
beer
is
unbelievable
the
burnt
malt
and
hop
characteristics
blend
perfectly
and
the
result
is
a
stunningly
balanced
brew
this
is
by
far
the
best
black
american
ale
black
ipa
ive
had
to
date
another
winner
from
firestone
walker
will
try
to
have
again
worth
getting
a
hold
of
love
this
beer
great
sipper
and
warmer
i
could
definitely
pick
up
a
few
more
bombers
of
this
without
a
doubt
firestone
walker
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
cheers
o
overall
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
this
i
didnt
look
up
any
reviews
before
i
cracked
it
open
and
it
blow
me
away
great
black
ipa
very
complex
brew
and
i
love
what
they
did
with
the
rye
also
im
picking
up
different
flavors
every
sip
overall
they
nailed
it
o
this
is
a
great
beer
would
drink
again
but
wont
be
in
my
weekly
rotation
o
what
a
fantastic
beer
and
especially
for
the
holiday
season
you
get
all
the
citrus
and
deep
dark
tones
of
a
black
ipa
without
any
of
the
heaviness
you
get
with
out
dark
styles
this
will
definitely
be
a
standard
during
the
cold
months
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
it
was
after
a
few
quality
beers
and
once
i
tasted
this
beer
it
stood
out
over
the
other
beers
great
quality
had
if
i
remember
correctly
a
nice
stout
taste
with
some
hops
like
an
ipa
good
stuff
this
beer
tasted
different
overall
this
was
definitely
worth
trying
even
at
19
bucks
for
a
bomber
i
can
definitely
see
why
its
so
highly
regarded
overall
i
cant
say
whether
i
just
had
an
old
bottle
or
this
beer
wasnt
for
me
i
understand
the
appeal
and
i
wanted
to
enjoy
it
more
but
i
found
it
average
nice
beer
glad
to
finally
try
it
overall
ive
had
this
on
tap
before
and
remember
it
being
better
this
review
may
not
be
fair
since
the
bottle
is
6
months
old
but
hopefully
at
some
point
ill
get
another
and
update
the
review
aroma
not
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
faint
notes
of
dry
roast
coffee
and
extremely
weak
resinous
hops
appearance
black
in
color
with
fair
lacing
against
the
glass
and
a
thin
foam
rim
taste
very
strong
bitter
hops
upfront
with
an
extremely
pleasing
dark
chocolatefudge
overtone
the
the
middle
of
the
mouth
the
rye
is
definitely
noticeable
and
it
seems
to
be
playing
off
the
chocolate
notes
extremely
well
theres
some
definite
tropical
fruit
in
here
possibly
some
mangopineapple
notes
not
really
getting
grapefruit
notes
as
you
do
in
typical
ipas
some
more
stout
characteristics
are
here
throughout
the
palate
notes
of
deep
rich
chocolate
dry
coffee
super
dry
finish
with
roasted
caramel
and
biscuit
overall
this
is
really
just
fantastic
super
bitter
noticeable
fruity
flavors
and
dry
stout
notes
a
really
nice
and
well
balanced
black
rye
dipa
not
the
most
complex
dipa
ive
had
but
i
would
order
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
o
amazing
offering
from
firestone
and
not
what
i
anticipated
the
focus
on
hoppy
ipa
and
foundational
support
of
sweet
malts
and
dry
rye
makes
this
a
perfect
balance
overall
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
brew
might
be
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
had
another
new
brew
for
me
dont
mind
these
guys
but
usually
only
see
the
small
bottles
and
even
though
its
not
barrel
aged
ill
take
it
and
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
creamiest
three
finger
head
that
settles
in
for
the
long
haul
and
aint
going
nowhere
with
off
white
lacing
everywhere
this
beautiful
looking
head
touches
on
looks
it
looks
very
approachablethe
smell
is
strong
piney
hops
and
i
mean
strong
they
really
dominate
with
an
underlining
of
black
peppercornssour
lollies
and
passionfruitthe
mouthfeel
is
just
under
full
bodiedmoderately
carbonated
and
addictive
with
a
beautiful
harmony
of
those
strong
piney
hops
encountered
on
smell
layered
with
a
sweet
molasses
maltinesssherbet
and
finished
with
a
calming
passionfruit
bittersweetness
and
when
i
say
calming
it
just
really
levels
out
the
bitterness
you
anticipate
on
finish
from
this
hop
bomb
and
overall
what
a
treat
such
a
nice
balance
not
seen
enough
these
days
and
just
reminds
me
of
how
tasty
this
style
can
be
also
great
endorsement
for
the
dark
side
as
i
know
ill
be
back
cheers
the
citrus
dies
down
and
more
of
the
roasted
caramel
with
rye
shine
through
i
understand
the
love
for
this
beer
its
the
most
complete
and
deepest
version
of
the
style
ive
had
to
date
this
is
a
solid
beer
a
bit
mysterious
even
i
feel
there
are
several
layers
of
this
beer
that
i
havent
yet
tapped
into
but
will
reveal
themselves
to
me
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
bottle
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
cool
fall
evening
on
its
own
but
would
also
make
a
great
partner
for
a
nice
blue
cheese
or
beef
stew
might
go
great
with
fried
chicken
as
well
good
stuff
the
best
combo
of
roast
and
hoppy
i
have
had
to
this
day
something
about
it
is
just
so
fresh
and
smooth
the
flavors
contrast
but
blend
so
well
here
at
the
same
time
bonus
points
for
this
general
stylistic
dominance
overall
i
think
that
this
beer
represents
what
i
really
like
to
see
in
an
ipa
balance
o
a
beautiful
beer
in
a
style
i
dont
normally
like
ipa
really
im
thinking
stout
but
whatever
this
is
a
fine
beer
i
have
the
fireplace
going
and
firestone
fits
right
into
this
chilly
night
the
rye
is
fine
why
not
rye
stout
dont
worry
im
going
on
a
three
brewery
three
hour
tour
soon
so
perhaps
i
can
figure
this
out
medium
body
a
bit
slick
and
oily
on
the
tongue
with
some
light
carbonation
very
much
a
dipa
with
just
a
roasted
malt
accent
on
it
pretty
tasty
overall
the
rye
really
shows
up
in
the
taste
astringent
with
the
black
patent
contributing
to
this
as
well
its
not
coffee
enough
to
be
a
dark
porter
or
stout
also
the
pronounced
hop
really
makes
this
a
great
hybrid
of
ipa
and
a
black
ale
moderate
aftertaste
of
bitter
hop
and
burnt
grains
thick
body
but
this
may
be
more
notable
due
to
the
very
low
level
of
carbonation
still
the
whole
package
works
very
well
like
any
situation
where
promoting
the
best
qualities
of
a
product
where
ones
bias
towards
the
perceived
inherent
flaws
make
said
description
pointless
i
shall
slog
through
and
endeavor
so
this
is
indeed
what
it
claims
to
be
black
i
e
burnt
big
and
hoppy
the
base
ipa
and
ryeoffset
the
use
of
additional
rye
malts
oh
and
approaching
imperial
in
alcohol
strength
the
integration
there
is
something
i
can
duly
sign
off
on

dark
black
with
a
ridiculous
head
i
had
to
wait
on
it
aroma

piney

had
notes
of
orange
and
spice
super
fresh
hoppiness
flavor
was
spicy
pine

very
well
done
for
the
style
and
the
price
is
super
reasonable
edit
had
it
on

at

and
while
the
oak
flavors
are
more
hidden
the
freshness
is
incredible
outstanding
both
ways
my
taste
buds
would
melt
if
i
could
find
this
one
on
cask
overall
one
of
the
best
american
black
ales
i
have
ever
had
some
people
feel
this
style
is
just
a
novelty
but
beers
like
this
and
stones
sublimely
self
righteous
go
to
prove
that
they
are
every
bit
as
delicious
as
any
style
out
there
every
time
i
open
a
bottle
of
this
i
am
amazed
at
how
well
balanced
and
delicious
it
is
drink
fresh
o
an
outstanding
beer
the
first
black
ryebased
ipa
ive
had
that
actually
used
the
rye
to
great
effect
it
offers
a
nice
crisp
dry
character
and
a
richness
that
truly
makes
this
beer
unique
bottled
on
date
7142013
o
ok
this
is
one
fine
beer
its
as
good
or
better
than
my
previous
favorite
black
ipa
founders
el
diablo
del
noche
gotta
have
more
of
this
make
no
mistake
about
it
firestone
walker
has
worked
really
hard
to
ensure
that
wookey
jack
wouldnt
succumb
to
just
a
hoppy
porter
they
go
in
with
a
dedication
to
it
being
an
ipa
first
and
allowing
the
complex
char
to
complement
the
grilled
fruit
aromas
heightened
bitterness
and
roasty
dryness
with
pinpoint
precision
o
its
another
man
this
could
have
been
amazing
fresh
situation
with
this
right
now
though
its
still
really
damn
good
ill
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
fresh
bottlekeg
of
this
o
a
really
fantastic
beer
from
fw
huge
complexity
of
aroma
and
flavor
nothing
overpowering
this
is
a
complex
and
very
tasty
beer
from
firestone
walker
all
black
ipas
should
be
this
good
overall
i
very
seldom
write
full
reviews
unless
the
beer
has
never
been
rated
here
but
i
thought
this
deserved
a
write
up
and
a
straight
55
i
dont
get
this
enthusiastic
about
a
beer
often
stouts
are
usually
my
thing
and
their
heaviness
often
helps
with
the
sophistication
but
this
ipa
is
complex
enough
in
flavor
without
making
any
mistakes
its
something
id
reach
for
before
my
favorite
rogue
beers
and
while
lagunitas
samuel
smith
and
speakeasy
very
seldom
disappoint
im
excited
to
try
more
from
firestone
this
is
a
new
favorite
this
brew
seems
lighter
than
an
8
percent
but
it
does
in
fact
warm
the
drinker
a
bit
moments
after
a
few
good
sips
overall
my
expectations
were
fulfilled
this
beer
did
satisfy
me
on
multiple
levels
i
love
big
complex
beers
and
i
like
the
delay
effect
the
taste
had
on
me
to
get
a
perfect
score
i
would
probably
have
liked
the
roast
turned
up
a
hair
i
would
strongly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
appreciates
extremely
hoppy
beer
with
a
twist
o
a
very
good
black
ipa
with
high
drinkability
not
as
distinctive
as
i
had
hoped
given
the
name
and
brewer
but
a
good
solid
brew
a
fresher
bottle
should
have
even
more
evident
hop
presence
o
although
not
generally
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
i
can
appreciate
the
tastes
and
complexities
of
this
beer
recommend
you
try
o
this
isnt
your
typical
black
ipa
as
it
uses
rye
that
being
said
it
finds
a
fantastic
balance
between
dark
grains
and
citrusy
hops
very
well
done
overall
an
excellent
change
up
from
an
ipa
dark
and
roasted
would
go
great
with
bbq
or
steak
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
this
was
so
well
done
that
i
loved
it

somtehing
to

to
break

of
my
fav

lots

isnt
that
strong
but
its
present
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
creamy
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
the
sweetness
makes
it
less
than
ideal

in

the
best
aba
ive
had
highly
recommended
i
am
not
very
good
at
the
standard
review
so
i
will
give
my
overall
impression
this
is
a
great
black
ale
from
firestone
pours
a
dark
amber
and
looks
inviting
tastes
wonderful
well
balanced
with
a
bit
of
warmth
at
the
end
this
is
my
first
time
trying
and
i
will
certainly
have
again
o
awesome
beer
im
a
big
hop
head
and
im
hella
into
this
because
of
the
earthy
tones
its
good
but
it
doesnt
really
come
together
for
me
overall
this
is
ridiculously
good
beer
it
is
getting
harder
and
harder
to
get
genuinely
excited
about
a
yearround
beer
that
is
widely
distributed
in
my
market
but
this
beer
worth
getting
excited
about
it
is
easily
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
the
american
black
ale
category
close
to
perfection
mf
creamy
and
viscus
with
a
long
finish
it
leaves
your
mouth
with
the
typical

drying
sensation
o
love
it
would
highly
recommend
to
anyone
again

i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
kudos
to
firestone
walker
for
brewing
a
unique
beer
without
taking
it
too
far
its
not
every
day
that
i
runn
across
an
unfilter
black
rye
ipa
id
definitely
recommed
this
beer
o
will
def
buy
this
again
quite
a
unique
taste
and
one
of
the
few
black
ipas
ive
found
on
the
shelf
poured
into
34oz
mug
jet
black
with
a
huge
thick
fluffy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
forever
and
leaves
tons
of
awesome
lacing
looks
awesome
and
as
a
member
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
im
excited
smell
is
piney
hops
some
rye
and
slight
chocolatecoffee
from
the
darker

taste
is
just
awesome
smooth
chocolatey
malts
with
a
perfect
amount
of
piney
hop
bitterness
and
rye
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
amazingly
smooth
this
is
a
nearly
perfect
beer
alcohol

highly

is
pretty
good
dark

foamy
head
and
some
persistent

nose
is
bready
with
some
savory
spice
peaty
and
roasted
malt
with
some
sweet
and
bitter
notes
great
combination
and
balance
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
the
flavor
hits
the
palate
with
lots
of
tropical
fruitiness
of
grapefruit
with
a
mild
pineapple
and
tangerine
effect
from
the
hops
with
mild
spice
and
some
more
citrus
flavor
as
the
dark
rye
moves
in
the
fruitiness
and
slight
caramel
and
dark
fruit
notes
with
a
luscious
lasting
hop
flavor
which
blends
well
with
the
rye
foundation
overall
this
is
a
great
imperial
black
rye
the
hop
flavor
is
consistent
with
other
fw
beers
lots
of
flavor
without
overdoing
the
bitterness
i
love
that
a
true
pleasure
to
drink
pours
very
dark
with
an
outstanding
head
that
disapates
like
a
stout
very
nice
look
but
the
smell
is
kind
of
weak
for
an
ipa
the
taste
is
nice
i
think
im
enjoying
the
rye
hop
blend
of
this
style
while
ive
only
had
two
of
this
style
with
terrapin
rye
pa
the
other
i
feel
there
is
a
trade
off
maybe
the
rye
downplays
certain
aspect
like
smell
and
downplays
the
hoppiness
but
it
does
blend
well
overall
its
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
because
the
hop
presence
is
a
tad
lower
i
think
the
tongue
burn
out
is
less
which
makes
this
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
i
enjoy
this
but
wish
i
could
get
it
in
a
six
pack
rather
than
a
bomber
i
would
get
this
again
however
neighbor
bought
a
bottle
of
wookey
jack
from
downstate
illinois
the
beer
was
excellent
it
poured
a
dark
chocolate
with
slightly
offwhitetan
head
that
left
a
very
nice
lace
the
scent
included
some
hops
but
was
prominently
roast
the
taste
was
a
roast
chocolatety
goodness
that
i
didnt
want
to
stop
there
was
enough
hops
to
smooth
the
astringent
coffee
undertones
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
to
full
bodied
beer
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
one
of
my
favorites
nice
carmel
red
color
full
head
with
a
dirty
cream
color
there
is
light
lacing
on
the
glass
mouth
feel
is
smooth
carmel
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
taste
of
carmel
malts
biscuits
dark
fruits
and
full
of
great
hops
over
all
a
full
body
easy
drinking
brew
overall
a
fantastic
beer
the
taste
is
amazing
and
i
could
enjoy
this
quite
often
the
only
thing
i
really
dislike
is
that
it
seems
to
be
thinner
than
i
would
expect
from
a
black
ipa
hence
great
beer
firestone
walker
did
a
great
job
with
wookey
jack
its
greatest
assets
is
its
ability
to
showcase
delicious
hop
flavors
and
spicy
rye
at
the
same
great
the
dark
malt
flavors
complement
those
flavors
extremely
well
if
you
havent
tried
seek
a
bottle
out
youll
be
glad
you
did
o
a
fine
balance
between
a
stout
and
pale
ale
makes
this
a
beer
that
seems
almost
sessionable
despite
the
8
3
abv
overall
somewhat
pricey
but
ill
seek
out
again
and
again
o
im
a
sucker
for
these
black
ales
and
this
one
hits
the
spot
its
refreshing
yet
also
decadent
i
still
prefer
hop
in
the
dark
to
this
but
wookey
jack
is
definitely
worth
the
buy
and
actually
available
this
sets
the
bar
for
how
these
beers
should
be
made
nothing
too
roasted
or
malty
and
not
a
hop
bomb
by
any
means
everything
melds
together
and
does
so
without
weighing
you
down
i
wouldnt
expect
anything
lesser
from
these
guys
if
you
arent
so
much
into
black
ipas
give
this
a
whirl
the
caramel
melds
so
well
with
the
pine
and
orange
peel
and
its
complexity
yet
ability
to
shift
flavors
over
the
course
of
time
makes
it
easy
to
drink
at
less
than
6
a
bottle
i
will
definitely
be
buying
the
next
one
that
i
find
fresh
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
here
but
perhaps
i
waited
too
long
to
try
this
4
months
i
really
like
black
ipas
and
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
was
bland
and
a
subpar
black
ipa
i
will
try
again
with
a
fresh
one
later
but
this
is
a
miss
from
fw
for
me
pours
jet
black
with
a
nice
rush
of
creamy
cocoa
bubbles
forming
a
strong
lasting
lace
ring
on
the
nose
is
piney
coriander
hops
and
rye
malt
sweetness
hint
of
smoke
taste
is
an
excellent
blend
of
bitter
and
malty
flavors
complexity
is
high
dark
chocolate
juniper
berries
grill
smoke
rye
bread
come
to
mind
mouthfeel
is
among
the
best
ive
had
begins
so
soft
and
creamy
then
the
flavors
run
wild
on
the
palate
finishing
with
a
sudden
perfectly
bitter
dry
finish
extremely
well
crafted
overall
this
is
an
excellent
black
rye
ipa
and
one
of
the
few
on
the
market
where
the
black
ashy
notes
mix
well
with
the
hops
too
often
they
clash
horribly
well
worth
trying
i
found
this
to
be
a
welldone
ipa
in
a
dark
suit
the
addition
of
rye
and
dark
malts
add
a
nice
twist
o
a
real
solid
black
ipa
hoppy
spicy
a
decent
malt
backbone
good
stuff
firestone
walker
i
had
written
you
off
i
am
sorry
i
didnt
mean
it
i
know
good
things
happen
there
the
costco
pack
does
not
do
you
justice
obviously
o
the
grapefruit
notes
on
this
beer
are
so
incredibly
juicy
and
pungent
nice
malt
backbone
on
this
black
ipa
this
is
definitely
at
the
very
top
of
style
for
me
really
tasty
stuff
o
really
a
solid
beer
its
a
big
beer
but
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
a
black
rye
ipa
i
am
amazed
at
how
well
all
the
flavors
are
playing
together
bottle
poured
a
deep
black
color
ale
with
a
large
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
spicy
rye
malt
notes
with
some
dry
hoppy
notes
with
light
resinous
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
spicy
rye
notes
with
some
resinous
dry
hoppy
notes
with
light
dry
bitter
notes
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
and
no
apparent
alcohol
really
nice
mix
between
some
spicy
rye
malt
with
solid
hops
punch
o
this
is
a
great
beer
overall
big
complex
flavor
profile
but
not
aggressive
still
easy
to
drink
the
only
knock
for
me
is
the
smokey
flavor
as
i
am
not
a
fan
of
smokey
beers
but
otherwise
i
was
glad
i
tried
this
good
big
complex
brew
deep
mahogany
colored
and
opaque
a
beige
thick
head
settles
out
quickly
low
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
flavors
of
citrusy
hops
morphing
to
orange
rind
pith
mix
of
pine
and
rye
spice
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
leaning
more
towards
the
hops
but
good
presence
for
the
roasty
dark
malt
rich
and
full
mouthfeel
creamy
finishes
a
bit
tannic
good
beer
overall
o
this
is
by
far
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
had
to
memory
because
there
is
evidence
that
it
is
in
actuality
is
an
ipa
i
have
become
quite
sick
of
ale
claiming
to
be
bipas
and
are
really
just
black
ale
with
no
hops
detectable
in
the
nose
or
the
palate
would
buy
again
cheers
a
near
pitchblack
brew
with
a
fantastic
rich
dark
brown
head
the
herbal
hops
flow
freely
out
of
this
one
some
dark
fruity
notes
and
faint
caramel
are
noticed
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
or
complex
with
the
aroma
just
right
on
target
caramel
and
bitter
chocolates
to
the
tongue
and
this
one
goes
down
smooth
as
hell
an
herbal
hop
envelope
helps
provide
a
pleasant
and
nonthreatening
counterpoint
to
the
sweetness
some
rye
graniness
and
plum
is
noticed
later
mediumbodied
at
the
most
and
the
alcohol
provides
warmth
but
no
harshness
fabulous
is
end
of
the
story
overall
very
nice
definitely
would
drink
this
one
again
and
the
balance
of
rye
and
hops
is
spoton
o
a
great
beer
that
mixes
a
few
beer
styles
it
almost
takes
the
character
of
a
hoppy
porter
at
times
then
at
others
a
black
ipa
very
nice
fsw
overall
a
really
enjoyable
beer
and
i
am
just
a
few
sips
into
the
bottle
this
is
worth
the
price
and
i
will
most
likely
look
for
it
again
overall
a
pretty
decent
black
ipa
but
nothing
too
outstanding
in
my
mind
it
ended
with
a
bit
too
much
coffee
bitterness
which
took
away
from
much
of
the
nice
hop
undertones
that
were
present
it
was
worth
the
try
but
not
one
i
would
go
back
to
with
any
real
occasion
7
for
bomber
bottle
quite
a
complex
beer
but
not
too
far
from
a
double
ipa
ive
only
had
this
with
sublimely
self
righteous
which
i
really
did
not
like
at
all
this
on
the
other
hand
is
a
really
complex
and
delicious
for
a
rye
beer
i
think
i
like
hop
rod
rye
more
but
just
slightly
this
really
is
an
impressive
beer
not
shockingly
different
enough
from
a
double
ipa
for
me
to
really
go
crazy
for
it
about
the
style
however
this
american
black
ale
leans
much
more
in
the
direction
of
an
ipa
than
a
dark
ale
of
any
type
while
it
lacked
some
complexity
it
was
flavorful
and
quite
drinkable
all
in
all
a
respectable
offering
from
firestone
walker
raul
doesnt
mind
popping
it
but
like
my
fish
oils
every
morning
it
wont
be
a
daily
thang
oi
never
know
what
to
expect
from
black
ipas
but
this
was
a
good
one
for
the
sortof
spicy
meal
i
had
anyway
this
goodlooking
brew
leans
heavily
toward
the
hop
end
of
things
and
fans
of
rye
spice
should
enjoy
on
the
other
hand
if
you
like
a
little
more
chocolatemalty
flavor
in
your
black
ale
you
might
be
better
served
elsewhere
final
note
for
an
abv
of
8
3
the
alcohol
remains
well
hidden
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
enjoyable
very
refreshing
really
like
this
one
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
ever
had
the
smell
and
taste
are
just
amazing
west
coast
style
ipa
mixed
with
midwest
style
porter
its
flavors
balance
out
perfectly
not
too
bitter
not
too
dry
not
too
roasty
and
not
too
hoppy
very
uniqueand
extremely
enjoyable
got
this
in
a
trade
and
really
wish
i
had
access
to
get
this
again
the
mouthfeel
is
spectacular
it
is
perfectly
balanced
smooth
sweet
and
dry
all
at
the
same
time
this
wooky
is
an
excellent
brew
that
covers
all
the
bases
and
a
wonderful
addiction
overall
really
good
a
it
could
be
an
a
but
it
is
closer
to
an
a
especially
in
the
firestone
walker
galaxy
which
is
filled
with
stars

becomes

as
expected
at

end
medium

feel

more
than
a
dark

this
one
goes
on
the
favorite
list
as
one
to
always
have
at
the
ready
overall
although
it
looks
like
a
dark
stout
it
is
infact
a
hopy
ipa
without
much
malt
flavour
at
all
im
glad
firestone
walker
is
now
available
in
texas
this
beer
is
superb
havent
had
much
to
compare
it
to
in
the
black
ipa
category
but
it
is
delicious
the
added
rye
is
a
nice
touch
o
amazing
beer
pure
and
simple
i
feel
lucky
to
live
so
close
to
this
amazing
brewery
while
some
of
their
beers
are
uninspired
looking
at
you
805
firestone
proves
time
and
time
again
that
they
are
simply
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
nice
brew
from
this
brewer
this
is
a
style
that
is
tough
to
do
right
they
hit
this
just
right
and
are
hopstrong
the
offbalance
here
is
actually
appropriate
and
works
well
not
overly
boozy
and
no
off
flavors
well
structured
beer
othis
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
the
rye
definitely
helps
this
beer
stand
out
as
difference
but
i
am
happy
to
say
i
liked
this
after
being
somewhat
underwhelming
by
union
and
double
jack
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
a
quality
offering
from
firestone
walker
22oz
bottle
with

printed
on
the
bottom

highly
recommended
among
the
best
rye
ipas
ive
ever
had
must
try
side
by
side
with
lennys
some
time
interesting
side
note
though
this
is
83
as
alcoholic
as
lennys
its
about
a
third
as
viscous
thanks
to
this
beer
im
starting
to
like
the
american
black
ale
style
the
malted
rye
in
this
beer
mixes
well
with
the
citrus
hops
grapefruit
and
pine
it
was
also
nice
that
its
not
an
expensive
beer
you
dont
need
to
break
the
bank
for
this
beer
would
i
drink
another
one
i
could
go
for
another
fresh
bottle
in
the
near
future
really
a
fantastic
beer
bold
and
intense
with
a
lot
going
on
yet
the
end
result
is
very
satisfying
and
drinkable
this
here
is
a
great
big
smelly
hairy
wookey
of
an
ale
and
i
like
it
nice
pungent
hop
aroma
with
a
nice
roasty
background
the
rye
really
shined
here
and
mix
well
with
the
hop
profile
good
stuff
i
did
a
blind
taste
test
with
another
black
rye
ipa
and
the
wookey
was
the
better
of
the
two
22oz
bottle
with
012513
on
the
bottom
of
the
label
pours
a
black
color
with
a
medium
brown
head
fair
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
citrus
hops
pine
earth
and
some
malts
the
taste
is
piney
hops
and
hints
of
sweet
citrus
and
roasted
malts
earthy
nice
alcohol
presence
bitter
and
chocolatey
at
the
finish
creamy
mouthfeel
tastes
boozier
as
it
warms
this
is
a
well
crafted
black
ipa
for
sure
overall
damn
good
and
worth
having
again
o
good
for
a
black
ale
but
still
not
really
something
i
want
to
be
drinking
all
the
time
o
i
normally
like
firestone
beers
but
this
one
was
unimpressive
and
i
wont
buy
it
again

this
poured
a
black

color
with

thick

the
aroma
has
a
fantastic
subdued
grapefruit
characteristic
from
the
hops
coupled
with
a
pleasing
roast
note
it
plays
well
together
with
a
balance
i
have
found
in
all
too
few
of
the
style
the
flavor
is
likewise
expertly
balanced
with
a
pleasing
bitterness
from
the
grapefruit
pine
notes
the
hops
lend
to
the
brew
which
is
balanced
by
a
light
yet
sharp
roast
character
all
wrapped
up
with
a
delicate
dry
finish
simply
fantastic
and
i
couldnt
be
more
pleased
with
this
brew
excellent
job
gentlemen
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beerive
been
loving
the
ryed
upped
ales
lately
and
this
ones
up
there
with
the
best
of
themim
not
usually
in
love
with
black
ipas
but
creamy
and
flavorful
with
peppery
rye
backbone
this
brew
is
outstandingsuper
drinkable
theres
not
too
much
sign
of
the
higher
abvi
had
heard
that
this
was
good
and
its
actually
greatim
definitely
gonna
get
a
couple
of
these
for
the
closet
to
share
with

should
be

nice
black
ale
but
i
wish
the
flavors
developed
more
overall
drinkabiity
another
great
example
of
a
great
style
overall
an
easy
drinking
black
ipa
easily
in
the
top
3
of
this
style
for
me
appearance
is
dark
brown
to
black
with
less
than
a
finger
of
tan
head
there
is
good
retention
to
the
head
however
and
it
leaves
rings
on
the
glass
that
are
almost
as
thick
as
those
left
by
a
nitrotapped
beer
there
are
certainly
hops
present
in
the
nose
but
there
are
also
roasty
notes
that
make
for
a
complex
olfactory
experience
the
flavor
includes
roasted
malts
combined
with
some
decent
hoppiness
and
accentuated
well
with
a
touch
of
smoke
a
pleasant
surprise
the
finish
is
not
super
hoppy
but
the
bitterness
is
enough
to
round
out
an
exceptional
drinking
experience
picked
up
a
bomber
of
this
bad
boy
on
recent
trip
to
ca
bottled
on
12513
poured
into
a
pint
glass
i
can
smell
the
hops
a
mile
away
wow
what
an
aromatic
brew
very
heady
bubbly
and
dense
with
a
light
tan
color
the
liquid
is
black
with
a
garnet
hue
and
clear
when
held
up
to
light
the
whiffs
of
aromatic
citra
and
amarillo
hops
that
characteristic
rye
spice
is
also
quite
pronounced
but
takes
a
back
seat
to
the
juicy
citrus
apricot
aroma
taste
is
indeed
hoppy
but
there
is
a
big
malt
bill
here
nice
roasted
notes
with
a
rye
spicy
zing
plenty
of
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
the
high
alcohol
content
is
definitely
not
obtrusive
and
hidden
well
beneath
the
ample
hops
and
malt
their
is
a
slight
bitter
bite
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
cleans
up
very
nicely
while
enjoying
the
first
pint
there
is
some
beautiful
lacing
present
and
a
chunk
of
head
remains
this
is
a
good
looking
unbelievably
aromatic
well
done
brew
ive
only
had
a
few
of
the
offerings
from
fw
but
am
really
impressed
superb
the
best
black
ipa
ive
tasted
this
is
good
but
not
upper
ecehelon
give
me
a
stones
itteration
on
this
style
any
day
but
pretty
nice
very
drinkable
the
abv
is
well
disguised
will
try
this
again
if
i
can
find
a
super
fresh
bottle
had
this
on
tap
this
compares
favorably
to
that
if
memory
serves
me
d
this
was
a
very
nice
rye
ipa
with
a
strong
scent
and
taste
and
a
solid
body
the
finish
was
a
bit
harsh
but
it
was
not
difficult
to
drink
yum
the
body
is
moderate
to
light
some
astirngency
in
the
finish
but
blends
well
with
the
hoppy
herbal
piney
notes
some
carbonic
bite
as
well
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
complexity
but
an
easy
drinking
beer
for
sure
from
growler
dark
brown
clear
pour
nice
citrusy
aroma
grapefruity
in
essence
but
not
a
totally
generic
chop
profile
at
all
flavor
is
citric
up
front
with
a
malty
finish
that
screams
rye
not
very
roasty
its
a
nice
idea
many
black
ipas
have
a
hollow
roastiness
that
doesnt
mesh
with
the
hops
but
wookey
jacks
main
malt
note
in
the
flavor
is
rye
a
tried
and
true
hop
complement
well
done
o
excellent
rye
is
outstanding
alcohol
is
hidden
soo
well
frothy
taste
is
amazing
certainly
buy
and
drink
this
again
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
o
the
is
a
style
that
i
havent
had
much
but
im
really
liking
it
this
one
has
superb
balance
of
piney
hops
and
toasted
dark
malt
would
gladly
drink
this
one
again
this
is
a
very
good
black
ipa
it
is
unlike
any
black
ipas
ive
had
before
this
makes
for
a
worthwhile
pick
up
22
oz
bottle
from
yosemite
valleys
village
store
wookey
jack
is
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
the
aroma
is
an
amazing
blend
of
pine
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
perfect
balance
between
malt
and
hops
slight
chocolate
flavours
with
hops
coming
out
in
sweet
lingering
bitterness

abv
is
well
hidden
youll
have
a
hard
time
putting
down
this
beer
a
nice
ryepa
from
firestone
and
worthy
of
trying
o
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
was
quite
excellent
i
usually
feel
that
the
abundant
amount
of
hops
and
dark
malt
dont
go
well
but
this
is
the
contrary
the
hops
and
malt
compliment
each
other
to
make
a
very
drinkable
beer
however
i
feel
like
its
lacking
some
complexity
o
4
5
i
know
that
many
beer
nerds
including
me
arent
crazy
about
the
lack
of
commitment
from
black
ipacdas
but
this
one
might
have
changed
my
mind
the
hop
character
six
months
after
brewing
really
impressed
me
and
makes
me
eager
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
or
on
tap
although
to
my
buds
its
the
best
of
the
style
on
the
market
its
really
an
imperial
rye
black
ipa
makes
me
want
to
try
to
brew
one
just
like
this
prosit
an
impressive
drink
a
substantial
beer
that
is
quite
delicious
and
one
of
the
finer
black
ales
ive
had
tons
of
character
to
please
the
senses
and
a
great
blend
of
rye
and
pine
just
plain
well
done
o
this
was
a
really
excellent
black
ipa
oh
man
i
wish
that
this
beer
was
a
little
cleaned
up
in
the
flavor
the
rye
gives
it
a
spiciness
the
hops
are
packed
in
there
and
very
dank
really
liked
this
beer
and
would
put
this
at
2
for
american
black
ales
for
me
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
bottle
on
121412
finally
fairly
fresh
side
note
when
they
first
released
it
to
new
hampshire
it
was
already
4
months
and
it
did
blow
me
away
pours
a
really
dark
brown
with
a
one
inch
head
that
leaves
nice
webs
if
lace
smell
is
pine
hints
of
chocolate
some
coffee
notes
some
citrus
and
some
cut
grass
taste
is
very
similar
lots
citrus
and
chocolate
blended
well
body
is
medium
plenty
of
life
not
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
is
really
solid
especially
when
the
hops
are
fresh
and
the
center
of
attention
going
to
have
a
sublimely
self
righteous
after
and
see
which
is
better
first
time
i
had
it
was
on
tap
at
1702
in
tucson
and
i
continue
to
buy
bombers
not
a
huge
firestone
walker
fan
overall
but
this
and
the
merkin
are
good
beer
poured
a
pitch
black
with
thick
tan
head
and
lace
ring
citric
almost
grapelike
hop
aroma
with
some
hints
of
roasted
malt
real
smooth
easy
to
drink
caught
me
by
surprise
on
that
not
a
hop
bomb
but
the
piney
citrusy
even
grapefruit
hops
reall
kick
in
and
are
balanced
by
some
roasted
malts
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
i
can
only
describe
as
bitter
chocolate
the
malts
lead
to
a
pleasant
dry
finish
not
overly
crisp
or
bitter
and
this
is
a
very
quality
sipper
and
great
example
of
this
style
as
this
style
seems
easy
to
botch
apparently
right
off
the
bat
this
is
a
beautiful
beer
its
dark
as
night
and
effortlessly
produces
a
rich
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
aromas
are
spot
on
for
a
cda
tropical
fruit
pine
and
tons
of
roast
it
tastes
every
bit
as
great
as
it
smells
and
the
bomber
is
gone
before
i
know
it
another
quality
beer
from
fw
if
all
black
ipas
had
these
fundamentals
id
enjoy
the
style
more
often
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
on
the
big
side
more
dcda
alcohol
is
spicy
and
drying
it
gets
a
little
tiring
after
a
while
rereview
update
10062013
had
another
bottle
and
found
the
body
to
be
much
better
more
fitting
for
a
dark
ale
also
the
taste
seemed
better
more
malty
hop
aroma
and
flavor
characteristics
remain
strong
per
my
initial
review
so
ive
bumped
up
both
taste
and
mouthfeel
by
50
from
my
previous
rating
and
bumped
up
my
overall
by
50
o
this
is
an
amazing
brew
luckily
my
bottle
is
super
fresh
a
big
and
perfectly
balanced
ale
the
best
black
ale
i
have
ever
had
by
a
nice
margin
overall
a
very
bold
flavored
aba
i
would
prefer
a
less
harsh
hop
profile
and
a
bit
more
malt
as
the
flavors
are
battling
with
my
tastebuds
wookey
jack
is
awesome
who
would
have
thought
that
firestone
would
produce
such
a
legit
beer
this
is
very
well
one
of
the
to
firestone
beers
around
and
worth
trying
the
flavor
is
bold
and
hardcore
a
very
rich
and
complex
beer
as
well
and
good
on
tap
as
well
in
the
bottle
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
beverage
was
its
boldness
and
nice
mix
of
flavoring
the
nose
painted
the
picture
of
something
curiously
sweet
and
fruity
which
was
nicely
intriguing
the
flavoring
however
was
a
departure
from
this
with
big
hoppy
bitterness
and
drying
pucker
by
the
end
of
the
sip
this
made
for
a
nice
contrast
and
kept
you
guessing
throughout
this
bitterness
might
get
to
some
who
may
not
be
expecting
such
a
bite
on
such
a
sweetseeming
beer
but
this
guy
remains
drinkable
and
is
a
tasty
treat
pours
blacl
with
nice
beige
head
took
an
aggressive
pour
aroma
of
pine
and
citrus
pretty
much
all
hops
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
expected
from
the
nose
flavor
of
pine
toasted
or
burnt
wood
smokey
roasted
malt
sime
spice
on
the
end
i
assume
from
the
rye
bitter
finish
with
the
strong
hops
lasting
one
of
my
favorite
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
with
lots
of
rich
flavor
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
the
beer
pours
nice
and
dark
and
it
has
a
very
nice
smell
to
it
all
that
aside
the
taste
is
great
i
havent
had
a
bunch
of
rye
beers
but
out
of
all
the
ones
i
have
had
so
far
this
one
is
the
best
o
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
nicely
spiced
and
flavorful
o
cant
stop
thinking
about
the
huge
bouquet
of
an
aroma
this
beer
presents
from
start
to
finish
this
beer
has
made
me
reconsider
my
tendency
to
avoid
rye
beers
d
oh
yeah
thats
good
on
of
the
best
american
black
ales
that
ive
encountered
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
brew
which
is
another
outstanding
example
of
firestone
walker
craftsmanship
all
that
but
i
love
the
name
very
sad
to
only
have
one
bottle
highly
highly
recommend
thats
a
great
beer
there
are
a
lot
of
new
ryebased
and
black
ipas
coming
out
on
the
market
but
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
one
this
good
oddly
though
my
affection
for
it
may
not
mirror
that
of
other
beers
ive
ranked
this
highly
cant
tell
you
why
the
brewery
the
style
no
telling
just
dont
feel
it
o
im
really
impressed
both
by
the
overall
balance
of
this
beer
as
well
as
by
the
way
in
which
the
taste
evolves
over
the
course
of
a
pint
o
the
big
hops
flavor
is
dark
and
pungent
with
some
nice
malt
support
this
beer
is
full
of
flavor
but
is
very
drinkable
and
the
lack
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
is
really
nice
overall
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
as
it
is
very
hoppy
and
very
complex
although
in
my
opinion
well
balanced
as
are
most
firestone
walker
beers
this
is
a
beer
that
will
impress
you
with
the
pour
impress
you
with
the
aroma
and
impress
you
with
the
taste
this
beer
will
make
you
go
out
and
find
another
try
this
you
will
be
pleased
overall
next
to
ryepa
from
founders
this
one
takes
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
dry
rye
beer
i
think
if
it
was
just
a
black
ipa
i
would
love
it
more
but
dont
take
my
review
too
harshly
since
i
hate
rye
beers
in
general
a
beautiful
black
pour
with
2
fingers
of
off
white
head
and
excellent
lacing
smells
of
pine
trees
caramel
roasted
grains
lots
of
hoppy
scent
the
flavor
is
piney
bitterness
up
front
a
slight
sweet
ruby
grapefruiness
despite
being
a
dark
ale
it
is
very
very
sweet
and
hoppy
the
rye
just
adds
to
an
exquisitely
sweet
flavor
profile
medium
body
high
carbonation
with
a
nice
stickyness
and
creamy
feel
on
the
lips
this
is
an
excellent
beer
of
any
profile
whether
you
stick
it
in
as
an
ipa
a
rye
ale
a
black
ale
it
is
fantastic
for
all
of
the
above
o
such
a
great
beer
on
so
many
levels
im
having
trouble
finding
a
single
flaw
one
of
the
best
american
black
ales
ive
ever
had
fantastically
balanced
keeping
both
hops
and
dark
malts
in
the
spotlight
equally
dangerously
quaffable
for
over
8
abv
i
had
no
problems
drinking
an
entire
22oz
overall
my
second
pass
at
this
beer
and
im
enjoying
it
more
so
than
the
first
attempt
not
quite
the
ideal
amount
of
roasted
malt
character
i
look
for
in
what
in
my
mind
is
needed
for
the
perfect
black
ipa
but
its
a
marvelous
brew
nonetheless
one
that
continues
to
grow
on
me
the
more
i
have
it
overall
45
awesome
beer
from
fw
flavors
balance
out
and
the
citrus
from
the
hops
is
a
really
delicious
treat
overall
a
great
beer
i
think
its
an
outstanding
example
of
an
american
black
ale
the
body
is
medium
and
lingers
on
the
pallet
soft
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
enjoyable
would
like
a
bit
more
of
a
hop
presence
on
the
pallet
but
this
one
is
sound
taste
is
spicy
rye
to
start
citrus
in
the
middle
and
dominant
pine
bitterness
through
the
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
okay
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
maltiness
to
support
all
the
bitter
on
tap
at
churchkey
served
in
a
mini
snifter
pours
dark
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
nose
carries
a
nice
bit
of
roast
and
chocolate
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
rye
and
some
nice
citrus
and
earthypine
hop
notes
flavor
is
hoppy
with
a
nice
underlying
bitterness
and
moderate
malt
sweetness
good
rye
component
as
well
as
dark
malt
sweetness
mediumfull
body
with
medium
bitterness
quite
smooth
very
nice
beer
o
this
is
the
best
example
of
a
dark
hoppy
ale
that
i
have
had
so
far
call
it
what
you
want
cascadian
dark
ale
black
ipa
or
american
black
ale
who
cares
its
damn
tasty
opossibly
the
best
black
ale
i
have
ever
had
it
has
great
balance
while
still
being
full
of
contrasting
flavors
that
are
right
up
front
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
medium
body
and
average
carbonation
serves
this
beer
well
easily
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
although
do
i
have
to
consider
it
in
its
own
category
black
rye
ipas
for
now
until
somebody
does
it
even
close
to
as
well
this
is
the
black
ipa
wookey
jack
is
the
first
offering
ive
had
from
firestone
walker
and
i
can
begin
to
understand
why
they
are
regarded
so
highly
on
this
site
the
fresh
green
pepper
hop
character
reminded
me
of
hill
farmsteads
society
and
solitude
2
that
i
was
lucky
enough
to
sample
a
very
well
crafted
beer
in
my
opinion
which
leaves
me
looking
forward
to
the
next
offering
i
have
from
them
my
initial
disappointment
quickly
turned
into
satisfaction
exactly
what
i
was
hoping
for
from
this
beer
more
subtle
than
a
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
which
is
a
good
thing
recommend
this
one
for
sure
overall
a
tasty
and
exceptionally
toasty
black
ipa
sadly
i
have
only
the
one
bottle
right
up
there
for
black
ales
and
another
winner
from
fw
overall
this
is
a
really
well
designed
beer
im
newish
to
black
ipascascadian
dark
alesetc
but
im
constantly
amazed
at
the
things
that
various
brewers
are
able
to
pull
off
within
the
style
and
this
one
is
no
exception
firestone
has
a
great
brewmaster
on
their
roster
and
it
shows
0
this
is
as
good
as
any
black
ipa
ive
had
you
wont
be
disappointed
overall
very
solid
brew
here
one
of
the
best
abas
out
there
overall
very
tasty
definitely
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
all
around
just
a
great
beer
always
been
a
big
fan
of
rye
beers
and
this
one
is
easily
my
favorite
to
date
pours
very
black
with
hints
of
brown
on
the
edges
half
a
finger
of
a
khaki
head
that
leaves
good
lacing
the
aroma
has
big
citrus
notes
along
with
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
has
similar
characteristics
as
the
aroma
but
with
some
spiciness
as
well
very
complex
body
with
a
medium
mouth
feel
very
good
treat
yourself
a
wonderful
beer
perfect
dark
black
pour
with
a
nice
thick
head
huge
amounts
of
lacing
on
my
glass
nice
toasted
malt
aroma
with
the
pineyspruce
smell
of
hops
really
nice
blend
of
roasted
malt
to
go
along
with
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
firestone
walker
is
making
some
great
beers
o
this
is
an
awesome
beer
and
rather
affordable
too
but
what
else
would
you
really
expect
from
firestone
overall
these
black
ipas
play
to
my
palate
perfectly
in
that
they
bring
together
the
best
of
a
stoutporter
and
an
ipa
when
im
neither
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
or
an
ipa
this
fits
the
bill
to
perfection
and
this
one
with
the
rye
adds
another
intriguing
layer
to
consider
and
keep
it
interesting
o
obviously
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
it
is
perfect
for
those
who
enjoy
drinking
ipas
of
every
variation
i
can
not
stress
enough
that
a
person
should
not
view
the
color
as
anything
other
than
color
it
has
barely
any
malt
character
people
who
dont
like
stouts
or
porters
will
have
no
problem
drinking
this
whatsoever
on
a
personal
note
i
really
wish
that
the
malts
would
come
through
a
little
more
however
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
this
is
a
really
great
beer
and
that
abas
are
really
open
to
personal
interpretation
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
resultant
mouthfeel
is
smooth
somewhat
thick
and
creamy
with
slight
traces
of
carbonation
finishes
dry
on
the
palate
as
expected
from
hops
this
is
an
intense
hoppy
complex
beer
the
rye
is
forward
and
peppery
the
hops
are
spicy
and
herbl
theres
a
nice
earthiness
that
settles
the
roasted
malts
theres
some
woodiness
as
well
that
isnt
as
pleasant
overall
a
really
good
complex
black
ipa
thats
worth
checking
out
first
sip
yields
a
nicely
balanced
brew
with
a
refreshing
burst
of
hop
flavor
rye
spiciness
is
present
as
well
bitterness
is
quite
mild
and
fades
quickly
into
the
malty
body
of
this
brew
this
is
a
really
flavorful
easy
drinking
beer
that
doesnt
fit
a
set
style
im
really
digging
the
hop
flavors
o
a
great
tasting
black
rye
ipa
as
identified
on
the
label
with
a
distinct
and
flavorful
profile
nice
touches
of
dryness
and
bitterness
the
tastes
are
quite
bold
on
the
palate
more
high
quality
from
firestone
walker
poured
out
as
a
very
dark
brown
the
head
was
a
light
tan
color
with
a
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
nicely
balanced
with
the
roasted
malts
and
the
hops
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
great
flavor
to
it
the
malts
are
there
and
slightly
roasted
but
not
chocolaty
at
all
the
rye
gives
of
some
light
spice
and
the
hops
come
in
and
bitter
the
beer
nicely
but
not
overwhelmingly
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
medium
bodied
with
generous
carbonation
with
a
nice
smooth
feel
to
it
overall
its
damn
good
brew
highly
impressed
would
totally
drink
this
one
again
this
seems
to
hit
the
bullseye
for
this
sortof
style
its
black
and
its
totally
hops
not
getting

on
highly
enjoyable
stuff
as
expected
o
im
generally
not
keen
on
black
ipas
but
this
one
stands
out
the
fact
that
you
can
close
your
eyes
smell
and
barely
tell
this
beer
is
black
in
color
puts
it
in
the
front
of
its
field
overall
an
nice
take
on
a
rye
ipa
would
consider
drinking
again
although
i
feel
firestonewalker
has
better
offerings
such
as
double
jack
overall
this
is
a
great
take
on
the
black
ale
style
very
good
hop
profile
matched
up
nearly
perfectly
with
the
great
rye
malt
profile
and
the
awesome
roasted
notes
o
a
fantastic
beer
one
of
the
best
cdasbipas
i
have
had
up
there
with
deschutes
and
stone
offerings
really
great
combination
of
flavors
and
the
addition
of
rye
to
this
style
was
an
inspired
and
excellent
decision
even
a
slow
measured
pour
yields
half
a
glass
full
of
deep
tan
foam
decent
density
with
an
island
of
bigger
bubbles
remaining
at
the
pour
point
retention
is
very
high
to
the
point
it
annoys
as
you
cant
get
at
the
liquid
to
sip
it
the
lacing
is
haphazard
but
whats
there
is
thick
splotches
dark
opaque
brown
hued
liquid
slice
of
zinc
orange
at
the
glass
bottom
few
if
any
bubbles
visible
inside
the
glass
the
rye
is
indeed
present
in
the
nose
however
on
the
whole
it
is
sweet
in
a
clean
manner
pine
grapefruit
caramel
chocolate
scone
crumbs
wrapped
around
a
core
of
apricot
peach
pineapple
scents
fresh
hops
give
it
penetrating
punch
without
unnecessary
bite
admirable
for
its
sinewy
linger
which
never
seems
forced
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
creates
a
tight
weave
but
its
active
and
keeps
things
bubbling
along
some
rye
pumpernickel
notes
yet
not
very
bready
once
more
relies
on
grapefruit
orange
citrus
pine
and
flowers
for
most
of
its
initial
effect
chocolate
molasses
anise
only
bring
mild
softness
instead
it
wants
to
stay
erect
as
the
leafy
herbaceousness
dries
out
the
midpalate
the
roast
mostly
present
as
aftertaste
that
pineapple
nectarine
apricot
to
papaya
fruit
drier
here
and
thus
further
into
the
background
tastewise
not
boozy
but
there
is
a
certain
headiness
to
it
it
crackles
with
the
kind
of
energy
and
verve
which
makes
you
want
to
gulp
as
much
as
sip
pours
a
pitch
black
with
a
finger
of
light
mocha
foam
good
lacing
and
retention
aroma
is
of
very
strong
hops
pine
coffee
chocolate
tropical
fruit
with
malt
and
some
alcohol
taste
follows
the
smell
quite
well
fruity
hop
bomb
laced
with
coffee
and
some
other
earthy
floral
tastes
malt
is
most
interesting
coming
from
the
rye
leaving
a
bitter
after
taste
much
different
from
that
of
the
initial
taste
of
the
beer
which
is
one
of
the
few
flaws
i
find
with
it
mouth
is
creamy
sticky
and
dry
over
all
a
good
black
ipa
not
my
favorite
but
deserves
an
honorable
mention
the
rye
isnt
something
i
much
care
for
o
fantastic
beer
im
a
sucker
for
black
ipas
and
this
delivers
the
rye
just
adds
to
it
o
the
best
that
ive
had
in
this
class
so
far
quite
enjoyable
especially
getting
into
late
fall
overall
american
black
ales
are
my
favorite
style
of
beer
this
is
another
excellent
example
of
a
aba
and
something
i
will
buy
again
for
sure
it
tastes
like
more
powerful
stone
ssr
overall
very
good
a
nice
hoppy
black
ale
well
crafted
o
a
very
nice
black
ipa
very
drinkable
and
balanced
figured
id
give
this
guy
a
try
alongside
some
other
tastiness
at
fountainhead
it
pours
a
dark
rubyhighlighted
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
pine
resin
grapefruit
rind
and
a
kiss
of
molasses
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
grapefruit
really
coming
in
stronger
and
being
joined
by
what
seems
to
be
some
lime
zest
the
result
though
comes
across
as
clashing
with
the
roasty
and
hoppy
factions
unwilling
to
give
ground
or
work
together
its
not
an
altogether
awful
clash
but
its
certainly
bloody
enough
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
generally
solid
black
ipa
but
one
whose
clashing
flavors
just
dont
fully
do
it
for
me
d
great
example
of
the
style
very
tasty
oa
great
great
beer
if
you
can
go
out
and
get
it
d
very
tasty
nicely
balanced
i
would
buy
again
and
despite
its
variance
ill
still
put
it
in
the
top
25
of
abas
for
its
drinkability
do
a
really
accomplished
black
ipa
with
a
hopsfocused
profile
that
while
not
exotic
is
brutallyawesomely
honest
in
the
nose
one
might
argue
that
it
lacks
representation
of
dark
malt
but
that
person
must
not
like
hops
overall
its
good
i
like
the
way
the
roasted
malts
were
sutle
and
complementory
and
understated
not
overpowering
some
bipas
are
borderline
porters
and
stoudts
in
my
opinion
not
that
thats
a
bad
thing
completely
black
in
color
poured
with
a
thick
beige
foam
that
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
and
left
ample
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
pungent
citrussy
hop
aromas
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
aromas
fighting
through
in
the
background
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
with
dense
rich
carbonation
pungent
citrus
hop
flavors
up
front
and
into
the
middle
with
a
tangy
hop
bite
dark
and
burnt
roasted
malt
flavors
emerge
below
the
citrus
hop
intensity
to
the
end
finishes
with
a
combination
bitter
hop
and
burnt
malt
aftertaste
the
intense
hop
and
dark
roasted
malt
aromas
and
flavors
are
in
competition
here
the
bitter
hoppiness
shows
through
more
but
the
roaated
malt
character
seems
to
intensify
the
hop
character
even
more
an
exceptional
black
ipa
d
a
sneakygood
beer
ive
never
had
a
beer
from
this
brewing
company
but
this
first
showing
from
them
is
nothing
short
of
excellent
this
is
a
good
beer
and
i
would
absolutely
recommend
it
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
rye
black
ipa
another
delicious
offering
from
firestone
walker
o
one
of
the
more
harmonious
black
ales
ive
had
nice
flavor
and
aromas
would
definitely
have
again
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
should
be
a
standard
if
you
want
to
make
a
black
ipa
cascadian
ale
american
black
ale
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
this
is
it
there
are
lots
of
black
ipas
out
there
since
it
became
the
thing
to
do
but
this
one
does
it
right
overall
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
of
this
style
o
a
really
smooth
and
tasty
black
ipa
pours
out
like
a
cola
with
a
full
finger
light
tan
collar
big
tropical
hops
from
this
one
pineapple
nose
and
flavors
as
opposed
to
a
piney
variety
theres
a
little
roastiness
in
the
nose
and
aftertaste
too
but
thats
an
artifact
of
the
process
to
achieve
the
color
dark
but
translucent
i
dont
get
the
classic
grainy
character
of
a
rye
ale
until
the
end
overall
the
entire
experience
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
hint
of
rye
grain
another
example
that
color
is
not
the
cover
to
judge
this
book
or
something
like
that
it
finishes
pretty
clean
a
tad
dry
with
a
fairly
intense
grassiness
that
lingers
nicely
at
8
3
itll
sneak
up
on
you
really
nice
drinker
especially
if
youre
a
hophead
o
this
beer
is
pretty
good
it
is
unique
but
i
definitely
couldnt
have
more
than
one
the
hops
are
really
intense
and
it
is
really
sweet
to
try
and
balance
out
those
hops
im
a
hophead
but
this
put
me
over
my
limit
for
hops
wookey
jack
is
good
stuff
and
definitely
one
to
try
if
your
into
ipas
or
black
ales
i
personally
prefer
its
lighter
cousin
double
jack
but
this
is
a
fine
beer
o
standout
beer
one
of
the
best
black
ales
i
have
had
the
flavor
for
this
style
is
superb
along
with
a
perfect
mouthfeel
jets
this
one
to
the
top
fw
keeps
the
good
times
coming
overall
a
good
not
great
black
ipa
i
like
the
way
the
pine
and
cream
interact
that
said
i
have
been
blown
away
by
just
about
every
other
beer
i
have
had
from
firestone
walker
and
this
beer
while
good
did
not
do
that
o
a
good
but
not
spectacular
that
reminds
me
why
i
dont
often
drink
the
black
ipa
style
flavors
and
aromas
too
often
cover
rather
than
accentuate
each
other
and
it
can
leave
a
nondescript
product
o
first
try
and
an
excellent
one
at
that
thisll
be
a
repeat
performer
im
sure
if
you
havent
pick
one
up
nitro
growler
from
the
beer
boutique
in
brooklyn
like
a
take
home
cask
this
is
a
blackbrown
viscous
fluid
that
hits
the
glass
and
slowly
foams
into
a
somewhat
dense
creamy
two
finger
head
fade
is
gentle
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
no
light
getting
through
this
one
and
as
a
consequence
i
have
no
idea
of
what
the
carbonation
is
doing
smell
is
sweet
and
piney
with
a
lots
of
roasted
malt
and
a
light
banana
like
fruitiness
toffee
and
scorched
caramel
flow
into
some
fresh
yeasty
brown
sweet
bread
and
hints
of
coffee
and
cocoa
taste
is
so
close
to
perfect
it
is
killing
me
not
to
give
it
sweet
and
roasted
malt
front
moves
to
a
heavy
dose
of
sweet
pine
hops
that
leave
grapefruit
skin
and
hop
oil
finish
is
quite
clean
and
dry
with
a
sweet
dark
malt
syrup
flavor
and
a
healthy
hop
blossoming
in
the
swallow
feel
is
velvety
and
almost
cask
like
with
a
superfine
carbonation
that
while
gentle
is
quite
active
somehow
creamy
too
weight
is
surprisingly
light
and
supple
dont
get
me
wrong
it
is
sticky
and
has
some
syrup
to
it
but
it
drinks
like
nobodys
business
and
you
can
quickly
find
yourself
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
is
a
superb
version
of
an
aba
it
hides
the
abv
like
a
double
agent
drinks
like
a
session
ale
and
has
a
perfect
balance
of
taste
with
big
sweet
roasted
malt
and
a
pine
dominant
hop
signature
wow
d
this
stuff
rocks
the
rye
adds
a
whole
new
dimension
of
flavor
that
works
great
with
the
extreme
amount
of
hops
used
the
nose
is
still
super
hoppy
but
it
is
not
a
complaint
for
me
great
brew
overall
probably
the
best
black
ipa
out
there
o
this
is
what
a
black
ipa
is
supposed
to
be
the
rye
adds
a
restrained
spicy
note
and
the
hop
bitterness
balances
perfectly
with
the
roast
making
it
a
continuum
of
bitterness
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
is
the
initial
aroma
hit
unmistakably
american
overall
alcohol
starts
to
catch
up
this
is
a
beautiful
sipper
from
the
22
oz
bottle
pour
it
twice
into
your
glass
enjoy
the
early
fall
fire
pit
and
go
to
sleep
nice
and
easy
pours
a
black
color
with
a
finger
or
two
worth
of
head
with
good
retention
smell
is
of
medium
roast
coffee
and
citrus
coffee
grounds
and
a
blast
of
hops
dominate
the
palate
complexities
come
through
as
it
warms
fans
of
this
style
will
no
doubt
enjoy
this
one
wondrous
beer
incredibly
light
in
body
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
make
this
easily
quaffable
dangerous
though
its
over
8
abv
and
while
i
get
some
alcohol
burn
its
hard
to
care
because
its
masked
by
these
wonderful
citrusy
and
tropical
fruits
a
nice
spicy
note
brings
this
beer
to
a
finish
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
poured
into
an
imperial
nonic
a
deep
cola
color
with
one
finger
beige
colored
head
atop
great
aromas
of
roastearthand
pine
resina
littlbitter
chocolate
is
there
as
well
as
the
beer
warmed
a
little
big
roast
up
front
on
the
palate
with
earthiness
and
bitter
chocolatethe
piney
hops
hit
hard
in
the
finish
this
is
a
big
brash
abamaybe
the
best
i
have
had
awesome
o
a
decent
black
ale
but
certainly
not
my
favorite
not
sure
i
cared
much
for
the
interplay
between
the
rye
and
the
heavily
roasted
malts
as
each
seemed
to
bring
out
the
worst
in
the
other
o
love
it
poured
into
new
holland
glass
appearance
is
jet
black
with
brown
at
the
edges
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
the
nose
features
lots
of
rye
up
front
followed
by
subtle
bitter
chocolate
and
a
nice
bouquet
of
herbal
hops
the
rye
is
king
here
very
forward
and
present
with
notes
of
caramel
hanging
underneath
the
taste
matches
the
nose
well
with
more
of
a
roasty
emphasis
the
hops
are
also
more
present
on
the
flavor
as
well
as
there
is
quite
a
bitter
punch
to
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
a
creamy
somewhat
hefty
body
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
black
ales
i
have
experienced
the
rye
works
really
well
with
the
whole
profile
alcohol
is
nearly
undetectable
definitely
worth
a
try
oreally
enjoyed
this
black
ale
from
fw
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
o
overall
exceptionally
smooth
drinkability
big
time
rye
flavor
with
a
perfect
balance
of
cascadian
ale
balance
of
piney
hops
honestly
few
reviews
could
do
this
justice
with
words
alone
trust
the
overall
rating
wookey
jack
is
all
that
o
another
excellent
beer
from
fw
o
a
solid
to
great
black
ipa
a
solid
example
of
the
style
d
i
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
very
unique
a
great
tasting
beer
with
hops
and
thickness
made
the
perfect
combination
d
really
like
this
beer
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
tasted
id
put
it
above
ssr
by
stone
i
might
even
put
it
above
double
jack
what
it
loses
in
drinkability
it
more
than
makes
up
for
in
complexity
d
more
memorable
than
youd
think
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
for
the
style
overall
nice
a
lot
going
on
with
nice
hops
dark
malts
not
too
roasty
or
astringent
decent
hops
typical
for
the
style
but
no
matter
how
good
they
are
all
those
flavors
just
dont
seem
like
they
should
o
you
gotta
try
this
brew
the
hops
are
really
killer
im
not
a
huge
black
ipa
guy
but
this
blew
my
mind
not
much
more
to
say
its
all
above
great
overall
beer
o
great
example
of
the
style
american
black
aleblack
ipa
with
only
the
subtle
notes
of
the
roasted
malts
and
the
stronger
presence
of
hops
flavors
and
aromas
very
enjoyable
glad
i
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
after
the
fiasco
of
this
being
distributed
in
nj
a
very
nice
brew
from
fw
i
will
definitely
be
going
back
for
more
of
this
beer
at
the
store
o
while
this
beer
is
dark
it
seems
to
taste
more
like
an
spicy
ipa
with
rye
because
the
roasted
flavors
are
not
that
prominent
nonetheless
it
is
rather
easy
to
drink
o
after
drinking
many
of
this
brew
i
review
as
i
enjoy
rarely
is
my
beer
fridge
wo
a
bottle
of
wookey
jack
a
solid
black
ipa
i
really
like
this
beer
black
ipas
really
excel
with
a
fresh
grasspine
profile
and
a
smooth
feel
throw
a
decent
amount
of
rye
in
there
and
this
is
right
in
my
wheelhouse
wellcrafted
and
easily
enjoyed
o
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
did
appreciate
this
beer
another
nice
offering
from
firestone
walker
and
for
the
brand
alone
i
wanted
to
try
this
one
lovers
of
black
ipas
should
enjoy
this
nice
brew
from
fw
wouldnt
mind
finding
some
more
of
this
o
having
only
had
a
few
black
ipas
and
a
few
ryes
i
can
safely
say
this
is
an
interesting
blend
of
both
styles
i
expected
it
to
be
more
like
a
bipa
and
forgot
about
the
rye
until
realizing
how
dry
it
was
its
definitely
worth
a
try
o
my
new
favorite
black
ipa
this
stuff
is
delicious
the
hop
profile
reminds
me
of
heady
topper
which
is
definitely
a
good
thing
the
rye
malt
blends
in
perfectly
awesome
overall
a
pretty
solid
good
black
hoppy
ale
worthy
of
another
drink
o
this
beer
was
definitely
good
i
just
feel
that
it
missed
more
of
the
roasty
and
darker
qualities
in
the
flavor
profile
it
walked
the
walk
but
didnt
talk
the
talk
it
still
has
a
good
taste
but
gets
docked
some
points
for
the
imbalance
o
highly
enjoyable
brew
but
i
really
wish
that
some
more
darker
notes
came
out
other
than
that
i
find
this
one
highly
drinkable
and
the
rye
notes
really
shine
though
and
are
well
complemented
by
the
bitter
piney
hops
overall
this
one
is
well
balanced
i
just
dont
find
much
complexity
o
i
had
a
conversation
with
a
friend
tonight
about
this
style
and
he
said
im
still
looking
for
that
black
ipa
to
change
my
mind
about
the
style
im
thinking
this
might
be
the
one
poured
an
opaque
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
that
retained
well
and
left
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
an
attractive
brew
for
sure
aroma
was
a
bit
muted
but
contained
scents
of
piney
and
floral
hops
and
chocolaty
malts
i
usually
brace
myself
when
i
take
the
first
sip
of
an
aba
but
this
one
was
surprisingly
mellow
and
wellbalanced
roasty
dark
malts
with
a
sensation
of
bakers
chocolate
countered
by
citrus
and
pine
hops
that
werent
too
potent
or
resinous
as
with
some
other
beers
of
the
style
i
think
brewers
are
finally
starting
to
nail
the
aba
medium
body
smooth
and
fairly
dry
in
the
finish
quite
drinkable
overall
really
great
beer
at
a
good
price
i
will
probably
have
to
pick
up
another
bomber
while
its
around
the
use
of
rye
i
think
really
wraps
this
all
together
nicely
and
makes
it
something
special
flavorful
smooth
complex
and
unique
definitely
a
standout
black

goes
down
in

another
great
hoppy
beer
from
fw
d
very
very
nice
the
combination
of
pungent
hops
and
distinctly
dark
malt
is
superior
to
the
anemic
black
ipas
that
only
look
dark
overall
i
like
the
hop
character
in
combination
with
the
malts
neither
dominate
both
contribute
nicely
served
in
a
fw
pint
glass
because
apparently
thats
the
en
vogue
thing
to
do
these
days
the
beer
is
opaque
and
black
displaying
a
mountainous
beige
head
that
completely
coats
the
glass
with
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
offers
roast
pine
and
rye
nicely
done
the
flavor
brings
piney
hops
with
a
slightly
roasted
malt
bill
alcohol
presence
is
nonobtrusive
beautiful
chocolate
notes
linger
in
the
finish
without
question
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
recommended
pours
a
solid
black
color
with
a
huge
creamy
tan
head
that
persists
forever
before
impaling
itself
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
smells
of
hops
no
really
piney
citrus
and
resin
with
a
hint
of
green
onion
theres
a
faint
roasty
bready
malt
aroma
that
attempts
to
provide
some
balance
but
is
really
only
there
for
show
the
flavor
hits
with
a
hint
of
malt
first
caramel
bread
and
chocolate
are
quickly
pushed
aside
by
a
solid
hit
of
citrus
and
resinous
hop
flavor
the
chocolate
comes
back
and
lingers
a
bit
in
a
sweet
resinous
finish
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
resinous
mouthfeel
very
nice
india
dark
ale
ale
or
hoppy
porter
very
tasty
with
great
aroma
i
really
enjoyed
this
o
its
a
safe
bet
that
anything
firestone
walker
is
going
to
be
very
good
this
one
doesnt
deviate
from
that
thought
typically
not
a
fan
of
rye
beers
but
this
one
has
a
really
good
balance
of
rye
hops
and
everything
else
cheers
immediate
hop
whiff
after
popping
the
top
is
very
appetizing
pours
a
dark
cola
brownred
settling
to
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
sizzling
onefinger
head
love
the
energy
of
this
head
initial
smell
is
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
pine
and
a
good
dose
of
rye
malt
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
sharp
carbonation
attacking
the
front
of
the
tongue
while
the
hops
a
bit
of
coffee
and
caramel
sweetness
caress
and
soothe
the
rest
of
the
mouth
some
chocolatey
goodness
coupled
with
rye
on
the
back
end
carbonation
is
nicely
done
on
this
one
with
a
medium
body
rounding
out
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
overall
very
well
done
i
will
be
trying
this
again
in
the
future
very
soon
really
solid
black
ipa
quite
hoppy
with
some
roast
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
normally
dont
like
rye
beer
but
this
one
uses
other
flavors
to
compliment
the
spicy
notes
of
the
rye
rather
than
just
let
the
rye
be
the
only
star
of
the
show
sweet
orange
and
ruby
red
grapefruit
up
front
balanced
by
bitter
herb
grapefruit
in
the
back
it
all
hangs
on
a
heavy
malt
backbone
with
barley
wine
notes
as
it
warms
dark
fruit
notes
can
be
detected
currants
overall
this
is
exceptional
definitely
better
than
sublimely
in
my
opinion
must
try
if
you
havent
the
beer
pours
like
a
lovely
french
roast
coffee
with
a
white
sand
head
with
big
rocky
bubbles
this
beer
is
opaque
and
has
velvet
midnight
black
in
the
glass
with
an
ever
so
slight
hint
of
brown
to
suggest
very
dark
chocolate
though
there
are
some
light
carbonation
bubbles
working
their
ways
up
the
sides
lacing
is
thin
but
sticky
and
gorgeous
like
a
complicated
root
system
splaying
out
beneath
a
lovely
fat
ring
of
soil
that
surrounds
the
glass
the
beer
smells
dank
and
tremendously
fruity
with
fat
mango
orange
pineapple
and
even
some
slight
pine
this
is
the
best
fruity
smell
i
can
remember
getting
from
any
beer
in
a
long
time
its
like
a
fruit
salad
in
the
hops
aroma
and
i
am
absolutely
digging
it
further
whiffs
suggest
the
tantalizing
roasted
coffee
malts
and
dark
chocolate
below
the
hops
all
the
smells
come
together
to
overall
remind
me
of
a
fruit
salad
lathered
in
dark
chocolate
and
coffee
the
smell
alone
has
me
salivating
for
this
beer
and
upping
my
expectations
tremendously
the
beers
taste
loses
a
lot
of
that
fruit
and
coffee
but
that
is
not
an
entirely
bad
thing
mango
hops
are
still
the
dominant
flavor
for
me
with
some
nice
side
character
fruit
hops
the
dark
malts
are
very
sideshow
in
the
flavor
appearing
mainly
in
the
middle
to
provide
some
lovely
creamy
roasted
flavoring
before
being
flushed
away
by
bitter
lessripe
fruit
in
the
back
and
aftertaste
a
ghost
of
the
roasted
chocolate
flavor
does
dance
on
the
fringes
in
between
the
undulations
of
the
fruit
hops
but
it
is
quite
light
the
rye
spice
is
also
a
ghost
in
this
taste
only
slightly
suggesting
itself
as
the
beer
moves
over
the
tongue
and
lingering
a
little
to
meld
a
spicy
burn
with
the
bitter
burn
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
almost
a
touch
watery
i
kind
of
want
a
thicker
beer
too
help
bring
more
of
the
roasted
malt
flavor
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
good
glaze
of
saliva
and
a
fizzy
bitterbitten
tongue
that
is
ready
for
more
if
only
in
moderation
this
beer
is
in
between
a
sipper
and
a
chugger
but
i
would
suggest
a
more
leisurely
sip
personally
alcohol
is
hidden
wonderfully
for
its
8
with
only
the
suggestion
of
a
bite
and
burn
hidden
beneath
the
bitters
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
the
black
ale
style
personally
i
would
love
to
see
a
little
more
malt
action
in
a
black
ale
but
this
is
very
nice
more
ipabased
black
i
also
would
have
loved
to
see
more
rye
action
in
this
beer
but
again
the
beer
worked
very
well
for
what
the
brewer
was
going
for
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
i
have
ever
smelled
and
has
me
dreaming
of
big
hops
and
malts
this
beer
is
definitely
worthy
of
a
sip
and
is
quite
enjoyable
wookey
jack
pours
almost
a
solid
black
with
just
faint
mahogany
highlights
shining
through
almost
two
fingers
of
bone
colored
head
crown
the
beer
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
fair
bit
og
lacing
left
in
its
wake
the
nose
has
a
bit
of
dry
coffee
to
it
and
thats
joined
by
a
juicy
pine
and
citrus
aroma
the
rye
which
was
undetectable
in
the
nose
shows
up
in
the
flavor
profile
it
lends
a
spicy
edge
to
the
upfront
coffee
taste
the
mid
palate
bitterness
is
fairly
noticeable
and
provides
a
nice
transition
into
the
finish
that
close
features
a
similar
pine
heavycitrus
light
balance
to
the
nose
its
just
a
little
muted
though
the
body
isnt
quite
bone
dry
but
its
definitely
on
the
light
side
the
carbonation
though
could
stand
to
be
just
a
little
more
energetic
ive
been
conditioned
to
expect
great
beer
from
firestone
walker
and
wookey
jack
is
no
exception
at
less
than
6
bucks
for
a
bomber
and
at
over
8
abv
this
is
by
far
the
best
deal
in
the
store
nevermind
that
its
a
fantastic
beer
pours
beautiful
silky
black
color
with
a
tall
and
lasting
off
white
head
it
lets
zero
light
through
and
is
shining
like
obsidian
the
smell
is
a
whole
lot
of
west
coast
hops
and
some
burnt
malt
there
is
no
chocolate
or
coffee
in
the
smell
or
the
taste
which
i
can
usually
find
in
a
beer
this
black
just
a
nice
smokey
black
ipa
here
with
the
alcohol
only
becoming
present
when
it
warms
up
a
little
it
is
smooth
and
warming
in
the
mouth
full
bodied
with
average
carbonation
it
has
a
great
bitter
finish
that
plays
counterpoint
to
the
rich
malt
profile
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
great
price
will
definitely
do
this
one
again
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
beige
head
significant
splotchy
lacing
as
the
head
recedes
some
roastiness
and
chocolate
on
the
nose
in
addition
to
orange
peel
and
some
grapefruit
notes
dark
chocolate
covered
orange
citrus
and
mild
roasty
notes
finishes
dry
with
some
white
pepper
spice
and
mild
alcohol
medium
bodied
with
abundant
carbonation
and
a
slick
and
creamy
mouthfeel
the
addition
of
rye
adds
a
bit
of
spice
that
adds
to
wookey
jacks
complexity
certainly
one
of
the
better
black
ipasamerican
black
ales
available
o
excellent
beer
rye
is
nuanced
very
well
highly
enjoyable
black
ipa
well
balanced
glad
to
hear
this
will
be
a
year
round
offering
from
fw
it
would
be
odd
for
these
steady
brewers
to
release
a
sloppy
or
thoughtless
beer
and
they
have
not
done
so
here
it
bears
the
firestone
mark
of
quality
well
its
a
damn
fine
black
ipa
o
overall
this
was
a
rather
enjoyable
black
ale
great
appearance
and
mouthfeel
really
is
what
makes
this
go
from
a
not
bad
to
a
would
buy
again
overall
this
was
really
really
nice
lots
of
hop
flavor
though
the
black
part
of
the
black
ale
namely
the
dark
malts
and
light
roasted
flavors
didnt
quite
come
through
a
better
feel
would
have
helped
showcase
what
was
there
a
little
better
as
well
nevertheless
im
very
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
this
enjoyable
beer
or
doopie
would
have
held
it
over
my
head
for
months
cheers
what
a
great
beer
very
very
hard
to
find
any
faults
in
wookey
jack
from
the
appearance
to
the
mouthfeel
near
perfection
best
fw
ive
had
yet
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
highly
drinkable
and
balanced
the
rye
malts
are
a
key
component

this
greatly
exceeded
expectations
as
much
as
i
love
firestone
walker
i
am
not
particularly
enamored
with
some
of
their
hoppy
beers
i
usually
find
them
too
herbalspicyearthy
yet
somehow
despite
the
fact
that
this
involves
rye
the
hop
profile
is
juicy
which
nicely
balances
with
the
roasty
malts
this
is
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
encountered
o
what
is
there
to
say
phenomenal
black
ale
and
a
treat
at
any
time
edit
make
sure
its
as
fresh
as
possible
i
bought
a
5mo
old
bomber
at
a
very
discounted
price
of
2
29
and
it
wasnt
as
good
overall
a
very
good
black
ipa
quite
enjoyable
overall
a
damn
fine
take
on
the
style
loaded
with
the
right
balance
of
black
and
ipa
huge
citrus
even
at
2
months
old
its
got
great
depth
rye
is
deftly
handled
and
adds
a
nice
element
nearly
jet
black

and
some

malts
as
it
warms
and
settles
there
is
also
a

a
nice
mix
of
hops
and
spicy
malts
taste
is
spicy

followed
by
pine
and

and
even
a

bitterness
mid
palate
with
a

lightmedium
carbonation
full
body
and
lightly

a
great
black
ipa
that
is
spicy
complex
and
hoppy
perfect
bomber
to
sit
down
and
sip
for
an
hour
or
so
will
certainly
revisit
this
o
an
excellent
black
ipa
the
rye
really
adds
a
nice
level
of
complexity
that
compliments
the
flavors
the
roasted
malt
is
largely
overshadowed
i
think
it
could
be
even
better
if
it
were
stronger
but
its
still
great
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
pretty
much
has
some
of
my
most
favorite
elements
all
in
one
beer
i
love
ipas
rye
beers
and
stoutsporters
so
this
was
a
guaranteed
hit
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
tasty
for
the
price
but
ill
probably
only
have
it
once
medium
body
with
ample
carbonation
very
slight
warmth
from
alcohol
the
combination
is
interesting
and
goes
well
together
nice
beer
odnot
in
love
with
this
one
was
expecting
to
enjoy
this
more
the
flavors
arent
my
favorite
and
they
seem
to
clash
with
one
another
worth
a
try
but
i
am
left
a
bit
disappointed
black
with
a
hint
of
dark
brown
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
good
head
retention
and
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
a
piney
hop
with
a
hint
of
smoked
malt
flavor
doesnt
disappoint
with
fresh
pine
hop
flavor
and
with
the
malt
brings
out
some
candy
or
bit
of
chocolate
sweet
o
an
interesting
combination
of
flavors
roasted
malt
rye
spice
and
ipa
fruit
they
sound
sort
of
dissonant
but
come
together
nicely
o
an
amazing
and
really
wellbalanced
beer
with
a
ton
of
flavor
and
complexity
flavor
does
not
disappoint
bitter
and
lively
with
hints
of
pine
resin
and
biscuit
carrying
with
it
some
nice
toast
and
slight
porter
qualities
the
body
is
silky
smooth
mediated
with
tight
sharp
carb
a
nice
beer
this
is
easily
the
best
black
ipas
that
ive
ever
had
huge
tropical
citrus
spicy
rye
and
balanced
caramel
malts
only
a
touch
of
roasted
malts
on
the
finish
which
is
slightly
deceptive
judging
by
the
color
well
done
overall
solid
black
ale
to
me
never
seen
it
so
figured
i
try
it
out
on
draft
before
it
hits
the
shelves
will
have
to
say
it
is
an
interesting
beer
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
balance
of
resinous
earthy
hops
sweet
and
roasted
malt
and
spicy
rye
again
the
rye
adds
complexity
with
level
of
spicy
swetness
that
counters
the
piny
hops
and
roasted
notes
grassy
and
piny
hops
followed
by
spicy
rye
with
roasted
and
sweet
malts
underneath
hints
of
chocolate
toast
coffee
and
oatmeal
lingering
into
a
dry
finish
with
subtle
heat
o
this
is
a
great
brew
i
love
rye
ipa
and
black
ipas
and
this
is
a
beautiful
marrage
of
both
anothe
great
brew
from
firestone
walker
loved
it
o
i
have
been
anticipating
this
beer
since
i
heard
about
this
years
release
my
local
store
ifnally
got
it
in
this
past
week
and
i
was
not
disappointed
great
citrus
pine
and
malt
flavors
and
aromas
complex
and
balanced
this
may
supplant
sublimely
self
righteous
and
yakima
glory
as
my
favorite
of
the
style
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
can
get
it
o
this
has
to
be
my
new
favorite
black
ipa
the
style
is
really
hard
to
pull
off
and
firestone
does
it
with
grace

well
and
is
a
tremendously
sessionable
beer
o
a
solid
beer
worth
the

tag
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
again
given
the
chance
i
really
like
the
rye
thrown
into
the
mix
o
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
black

ive
ever
had

only

mixed
with
light

and
dark

all
balanced
with
a
nice

definitely
very
fresh
and
im
very
glad
we
finally
got
this
in
i
definitely
recommend
picking
this
one
up
its
a
great
beer
for
the
price

d
very
drinkable
i
like
the
rye
addition
to
the
black
ipa
and
the
balance
is
really
spot
on
o
a
real
winner
i
love
this
beer
arguably
one
of
the
best
ryepas
out
there
right
now
for
sure
beautiful
balance
what
a
wookie
overall
i
like
it
ive
had
better
and
not
much
worse
it
lacks
a
palate
balancing
malt
sweetness
to
offset
the
bitter
hoppiness
i
would
have
it
again
though
o
whew
this
is
good
i
really
dig
this
style
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
4
0
d
good
beer
among
a
wretched
style
i
dont
think
i
would
have
given
such
high
scores
if
this
was
any
other
style
but
so
it
is
making
a
black
ipa
that
is
even
drinkable
is
already
above
average
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
there
are
so
many
incredible
beers
out
there
but
firestone
walker
continues
to
impress
me
with
every
new
addition
to
their
line
i
have
never
had
a
black
rye
ipa
before
but
this
one
has
set
an
incredibly
high
standard
for
me
o
im
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
beer
doesnt
need
to
get
any
more
perfect
find
it
drink
it
sleep
next
to
the
bottle
id
throw
this
up
with
the
ranks
of

already

you
could
label

of

with

its
restrained

any

plenty
of

there
is

its

this
is
one
to
add
to
your

nice

with
a
deep
woody
bitterness
c
probably
the
best
black
ipa
that
i
have
had
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
the
flavor
and
feel
was
so
smooth
pours
black
with
a
khaki
head
an
aroma
filled
with
the
smell
of
the
woods
and
pine
trees
some
rye
and

a
very
smooth
flavor
or
pine
chocolate

a
nice
full

overall
not
a

fan
at
all

i
love
this
one
the
balance
and
smoothness
to
this
was
very
impressive
o
awesome
straight
up
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
rubybrown
coloring
with
a
thin
filmy
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
rich
sugary
caramel
with
a
smokey
highlight
and
a
tangy
resiny
presence
smells
interesting
and
tasty
flavors
are
a
darker
and
heavier
roasted
sweetness
in
the
backbone
with
some
plum
and
date
characteristics
blending
with
a
roasted
coffee
bitterness
the
hops
bitterness
then
chimes
in
with
resiny
and
floral
components
very
dark
and
well
blended
presenting
with
a
meatier
and
smoother
feel
than
most
ryes
smooth
aftertaste
of
roasted
grain
and
mildly
bitter
hops
clean
slightly
sweet
lingering
finish
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
the
hops
flavors
build
a
bit
while
you
make
your
way
through
multiple
servings
but
overall
it
avoids
being
overpowering
very
tasty
o
this
is
a
great
occasional
buy
for
7
but
im
not
sure
its
worth
the
small
premium
over
sublimely
self
righteous
overall
an
excellent
black
ipa
overall
excellent
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
did
i
mention
its
easy
drinking
and
smooth
could
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble
with
this
one
most
highly
recommend
not
available
here
in
tx
got
in
care
package
from
umagum
rotation
if
available
here
id
grab
several
and
pray
that
this
becomes
a
regular
release
hy
picked
this
up
in
a
trade
with
bfg75
dark
brown
almost
black
pour
with
a
big
two
finger
off
white
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
glorious
nose
with
loads
of
piney
resiny
hops
to
complement
the
rye
which
was
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
would
have
expected
roasty
malt
with
hints
of
cocoa
balance
it
out
nicely
the
taste
is
just
as
bold
as
the
nose
tons
of
resiny
piney
citrus
hops
are
balanced
perfectly
with
a
solid
roasty
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
caramel
and
cocoa
the
rye
is
once
again
subdued
but
definitely
adds
a
unique
twist
to
your
typical
black
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
bitter
hop
finish
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
on
this
one
probably
the
most
balanced
black
ipa
ive
tasted
to
date
maybe
even
the
best
overall
another
amazing
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
thanks
to
ben
for
hooking
me
up
with
this
one
overall
a
very
fine
example
of
the
style
o
most
hopforward
black
ipa
i
have
had
the
hop
profile
and
aroma
is
makes
you
think
you
are
drinking
a
regular
ipa
or
an
imperial
amber
but
the
slight
roasty
finish
lets
you
know
the
dark
malt
is
there
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
one
o
another
winner
from
firestone
walker
its
the
best
black
rye
ipa
ive
ever
had
the
only
one
so
far
i
like
the
combination
and
can
imagine
some
pastrami
on
pumpernickle
going
well
with
this
the
palate
opens
with
a
big
hop
flavor
a
blend
of
citrus
tropical
fruit
and
pine
theres
some
papaya
and
pineapple
to
complement
the
citrus
as
well
this
is
followed
by
a
blend
of
roast
light
caramel
and
unsweetened
cocoa
cocoa
and
citrus
is
a
favorite
combination
of
mine
especially
when
done
right
and
this
beer
does
just
that
the
rye
does
add
another
dimension
a
wholesome
spicy
grain
flavor
that
matches
well
with
the
pine
the
bitterness
lasts
on
the
finish
not
as
resiny
as
id
like
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
all
of
which
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
while
the
finish
also
doesnt
have
quite
enough
roast
for
my
liking
and
is
even
a
tad
watery
at
times
but
it
further
aids
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
which
is
through
the
roof
imo
this
was
a
very
good
entry
into
the
black
ipa
category
from
firestone
that
really
packs
a
fierce
nature
on
the
palate
thanks
to
that
assertive
mix
of
american
hops
rye
and
high
abv
this
was
just
balanced
enough
to
stay
drinkable
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
very
much
sometimes
its
fun
to
just
brutalize
your
mouth
with
flavor
overall
another
really
excellent
firestone
walker
beer
overall
this
was
an
impressive
beer
i
would
recommend
in
a
second
have
always
liked
black
ipas
and
adding
rye
makes
perfect
sense
pick
this
stuff
up
if
you
have
the
chance
if
you
are
an
ipa
guy
this
is
an
absolute
amazing
change
of
pace
for
you
if
you
are
a
porterstout
guy
give
this
a
shot
and
try
to
enjoy
this
hopped
up
dark
brew
o
i
cant
believe
this
is
my
first
review
of
a
firestone
beer
its
kind
of
shameful
being
that
i
lived
in
slo
for
5
years
that
being
said
this
one
is
very
tasty
just
solid
all
around
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
black
ipas
or
rye
beers
but
this
one
might
have
made
me
change
my
mind
overall
this
beer
is
at
the
top
of
the
food
chain
when
it
comes
to
black
ales
and
black
ipas
flavor
so
complex
and
intrciate
that
it
blasts
your
palates
i
will
buy
it
again
as
long
as
it
is
in
stock
hopefully
salud
o
having
tasted
some
of
the
other
firestone
walker
offerings
this
was
just
okay
for
them
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
it
stands
as
a
solid
sampling
of
a
rye
ipa
but
not
my
beer
of
choice
for
firestone
walker
or
the
style
its
worth
a
try
but
i
dont
think
id
grab
it
again
particularly
if
the
double
jack
is
available
o
really
enjoy
this
beer
wish
there
was
more
rye
presence
but
none
the
less
very
solid
offering
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
balanced
and
tasty
with
nicely
balanced
rye
character
o
its
a
great
rye
ipa
but
not
in
my
top
5
still
worth
trying
seeing
for
yourself
o
this
was
my
first
black
ipa
and
i
cant
say
im
a
fan
not
bad
just
not
what
im
in
the
mood
for
on
a
summer
night
the
nose
on
this
is
really
awesome
and
it
looks
beautiful
sadly
it
goes
downhill
after
that
not
much
downhill
but
still
enough
to
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
one
of
my
favorites
within
the
style
i
love
this
stuff
upfront
is
that
same
juicy
pineapple
hops
hit
then
as
the
spicy
rye
and
roasted
barley
roll
in
so
does
a
spicier
citrus
hops
mix
damn
thats
tasty
the
body
is
a
little
lighter
for
an
8
beer
and
the
semidry
peppery
finish
makes
this
almost
too
drinkable
find
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
carbonation
bubbles
rise
up
in
the
beer
during
the
entire
drink
down
a
foamy
curtain
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
citrus
zest
and
some
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
very
nice
balance
between
roast
and
hop
aromas
and
flavors
wookie
came
to
me
looking
to
me
black
in
the
glass
saying
drink
me
the
liquid
is
a
deep
black
with
small
brown
edges
on
the
edge
a
nice
cream
colored
head
that
is
a
nice
inch
with
nice
retentionand
stick
clings
down
the
glass
smell
is
very
bright
with
citrus
hop
scent
a
nice
dose
of
chocolate
some
roast
and
a
bit
of
perfume
the
hops
do
shine
with
vigor
with
a
nice
floraltropic
display
taste
is
tropic
up
front
swindled
by
the
chocolate
malt
there
is
a
nice
rye
component
here
that
strays
this
from
the
big
black
ipa
pack
i
dont
know
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
seems
a
bit
different
and
flavorful
a
nice
build
with
not
a
heaping
of
alcohol
10ozs
is
plenty
for
me
though
great
balance
of
flavors
first
black
ipa
that
wasnt
over
roasty
a
fantastic
blend
of
flavors
thats
more
subdued
than
other
pioneers
of
the
style
however
i
would
call
it
a
more
refined
flavor
with
the
rye
and
complex
flavors
hops
german
magnum
bittering
citra
amarillo
flavoraroma
and
double
dryhopped
o
fw
is
really
becoming
my
goto
brewer
lately
and
wookey
only
furthers
that
path
ideally
balanced
beer
as
are
most
of
theirs
refreshing
complex
and
just
damn
good
find
it
trade
for
it
just
get
it
move
over
stone
fw
now
has
the
best
black
ipa
o
very
good
the
bitterness
is
there
but
ive
had
much
more
potent
abas
the
rye
adds
a
lot
of
character
which
is
always
a
plus
the
smell
is
terrific
skunky
pine
heaven
into
my
nostrils
the
taste
follows
suit
with
as
juxtaposition
of
dark
toffee
malts
against
bright
lemonlime
pine
some
rye
spice
rounds
out
the
deal
medium
in
the
mouth
with
moderate
drying
this
is
a
very
unusual
black
ale
due
to
the
interesting
hop
varietals
i
believe
that
this
recipe
may
have
changed
a
bit
since
i
reviewed
the
growler
a
couple
months
back
the
rye
seems
much
more
evident
now
which
is
both
good
and
bad
the
hop
aromas
are
slightly
muted
as
a
result
but
it
is
fun
to
have
the
spice
of
the
rye
show
through
a
tad
more
well
done
to
fwbc
notes
overall
a
nicely
balanced
brew
that
for
me
doesnt
quite
coordinate
the
roast
and
hoppiness
but
is
very
drinkable
reasonably
refined
and
nicely
hoppy
o
a
fine
beer
o
good
stuff
closer
to
the
hoppy
porter
territory
than
most
abas
but
im
good
with
that
dark
brown
in
body
almost
black
with
a
dirty
tan
head
good
lacing
and
retention
nose
has
some
notable
citrus
hop
aromas
and
pine
some
sweetness
but
spicy
rye
and
roast
notes
are
notable
great
interplay
of
dark
malts
rye
roast
chocolate
and
citrus
hops
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
medium
full
roasty
and
moderately
bitter
a
really
solid
rye
black
ipa
wish
i
had
another
one
right
now
actually
o
extremely
solid
brew
from
fw
once
again
this
one
sits
behind
stone
escondidian
in
the
category
but
not
by
much
and
thats
saying
a
lot
as
stones
was
a
truly
remarkable
brew
firestone
does
good
once
again
m
medium

with
a
good

beer

sweet
on
the
finish
it
is
only
mildly
bitter
and
has
this
nutty
roasty
bitterness
at
the
backend
it
is
pretty
enjoyable
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
hops
based
on
the
description
wow
just
wow
this
is
a
phenomenally
good
beer
exciting
complex
rich
but
for
all
that
balanced
and
exceptionally
drinkable
gorgeous
stuff
just
gorgeous
picked
this
up
in
buffalo
been
lucky
enough
to
try
the
union
and
double
jack
and
now
the
wookey
jack
pours
a
jet
black
with
creamy
white
head
smells
very
floral
and
hoppy
just
lovely
tastes
of
slight
citrus
with
some
rye
malt
coming
through
in
the
finish
nice
hop
presence
and
good
crisp
finish
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
its
quite
easy
to
drink
overall
its
very
good
not
the
best
double
jack
is
a
better
bang
for
the
buck
o
cold
this
leans
more
toward
an
ipa
with
a
richer
creamier
roasty
backbone
warm
it
shows
more
of
the
rye
by
no
means
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
definitely
stands
out
there
is
as
much
rye
in
this
one
as
any
beer
ive
had
i
would
have
another
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
medium
bodied
a
little
hop
resin
a
little
chewy
and
moderately
carbonated
good
stuff
get
it
medium
body
decent
carbonation
sticky
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
was
really
tasty
possibly
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
in
recent
memory
o
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
black
ipa
one
of
the
best
ive
had
probably
the
nose
is
balanced
really
well
between
hops
and
malts
and
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
would
like
to
have
it
again
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
abv
is
well
hidden
the
multiple
flavors
are
well
blended
another
outstanding
effort
by
firestone
walker
o
another
great
beer
from
fw
wish
we
got
distribution
in
georgia
my
favorite
of
the
style
is
stones
ssr
becuase
it
leans
more
toward
the
citrussy
dipa
style
before
it
does
the
black
that
out
of
balance
is
what
makes
stones
my
favorite
whereas
wookey
jack
blends
the
two
in
perfect
harmony
id
say
firestone
nailed
it
great
job
again
from
a
great
brewery
overall
a
good
brew
which
is
balanced
but
expected
more
stout
flavour
and
a
heavier
body
rather
than
a
simply
a
grainy
malty
ipa
o
a
detailed
craftsmanship
and
rich
smoothness
full
of
deep
and
semisweet
roasted
character
another
great
firestone
walker
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
the
hoppiness
was
very
juicy
and
fresh
and
the
touch
of
chocolate
didnt
clash
with
the
hops
as
a
lot
of
abas
do
for
me
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
well
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
overall
another
great
beer
from
fw
great
balance
anf
flavors
glad
i
bought
more
o
im
no
fan
of
black
ipas
black
rye
ipas
ryepas
etc
etc
i
pretty
much
can
live
without
these
beers
because
they
confuse
my
palette
too
much
and
i
almost
never
enjoy
them
in
this
particular
case
firestone
walker
has
done
a
superb
job
of
blending
everything
and
i
have
to
say
i
would
buy
more
of
this
beer
its
drinking
very
well
right
now
and
is
not
one
i
would
let
sit
in
the
bottle
too
long
if
my
choice
would
boil
down
to
a
blackblack
rye
ipa
and
a
regular
ipa
of
similar
hoppiness
ill
pick
the
regular
ipa
almost
every
time
and
this
is
a
rare
exception
that
peaks
my
interest
worth
a
try
but
get
it
now
before
the
hops
start
to
fade
unless
you
prefer
otherwise
bright
hops
are
the
center
piece
of
this
beer
adding
aroma
and
bitterness
smooth
even
mouthfeel
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
shows
the
fw
craft
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
dark
malt
and
felt
it
was
rather
pointless
to
brew
this
as
a
black
ipa
if
the
malt
just
gets
buried
under
you
need
to
seek
this
beer
out
i
believe
it
to
be
up
in
the
world
class
category
amazingly
complex
and
delicious
o
not
sure
i
care
for
this
one
the
hop
profile
doesnt
really
do
it
for
me
seems
pretty
onedimensional
d
other
than
the
mildly
flaccid
feel
and
harsh
carbonation
this
beer
is
quite
excellent
perhaps
bottle
conditioning
will
fix
these
issues
in
any
case
i
would
definitely
seek
this
out
again
and
would
happily
have
multiple
glasses
in
an
evening
o
smells
like
a
hop
bomb
but
drinks
very
balanced
i
must
say
that
im
impressed
and
this
beer
is
finely
crafted
and
not
something
thrown
together
to
capitalize
on
the
popularity
of
the
style
probably
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
overall
hoppy
but
not
malty
but
not
so
i
guess
thats
good
for
a
black
pale
ale
auto
logged
off
again
a
minute
ago
and
data
lost
why
do
i
review
live
the
look
and
smell
of
this
beer
have
a
huge
wow
factor
and
even
the
initial
sip
is
pretty
tasty
it
becomes
apparent
rather
quickly
though
that
this
is
not
something
i
could
drink
alot
of
definitely
worth
a
try
though
but
split
this
bomber
with
a
friend
reeeeally
enjoying
my
bomber
of
wookey
jack
you
would
too
boomshakalaka
o
my
favorite
black
ipa
ive
had
so
far
really
inpressed
fw
ipas
seem
to
be
top
notch
in
every
way
5
pours
a
dark
greyish
brown
moderate
cap
of
dense
brown
froth
great
retention
and
lacing
scent
of
strong
pine
grapefruit
lightly
sweet
malt
with
faint
faint
toast
no
heavy
char
or
roast
found
in
others
of
the
style
smooth
and
bitter
grapefruit
and
pine
uniquely
light
malt
presence
was
told
the
dark
grains
for
color
only
not
scent
or
flavor
medium
bodied
oily
lingering
bitterness
perhaps
the
best
black
ipa
around
the
black
is
for
show
and
the
hops
still
star
oone
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
the
balance
is
amazing
overall
really
outstanding
o
overall
this
is
an
excellent
black
ale
the
color
and
smell
throw
you
off
in
a
good
way
im
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
black
ipa
or
cascadian
dark
style
but
this
is
pretty
excellent
hopefully
well
see
this
down
in
baltimore
at
some
point
as
id
love
to
be
able
to
order
this
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
big
beer
and
is
considerable
ive
had
imperial
stouts
which
gave
me
less
pause
on
first
taste
like
everything
firestone
does
though
this
turned
out
near
the
top
of
the
heap
for
the
style
another
winner
roasted
malts
have
been
applied
with
a
deft
hand
in
this
brew
theres
just
enough
to
round
out
the
edges
of
the
flavor
but
not
so
much
that
the
hops
are
interrupted
the
flavor
doesnt
pull
your
arms
out
of
their
sockets
but
rather
caresses
you
with
a
wookieelike
growl
ghaaa
overall
a
very
enjoyable
black
ipa
easy
to
quaff
an
somewhat
refreshing
o
really
nice
but
thats
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
f
w
the
thick
chewiness
of
the
rye
adds
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
burnt
charred
malt
and
the
citrus
punch
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
ranks
near
the
top
of
it
overall
i
gotta
say
before
wookey
jack
i
thought
that
new
gluarus
black
top
was
the
best
black
ipa
that
i
have
ever
drank
i
also
thought
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
better
black
ipa
firestone
walker
proved
me
wrong
the
x
factor
for
wookey
jack
that
makes
it
better
is
the
rye
the
rye
adds
this
spiciness
and
great
complexity
that
just
works
so
well
let
not
forget
this
is
a
very
affordable
bomber
costing
around
6
to
8
dollars
o
disappointed
to
be
honest
burnt
malt
spicy
rye
bitter
hops
is
just
too
much
for
my
taste
it
did
grow
on
me
and
become
less
abrasive
as
i
went
on
but
still
not
one
of
my
favorite
fw
brews
o
the
flavors
come
together
well
to
make
this
an
awesome
example
of
a
unique
version
of
the
style
with
so
many
black
ales
out
there
this
is
different
enough
to
merit
high
marks
a
winner
all
the
way
by
firestone
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
highly
highly
recommended
cost
8
for
a
12
oz
tulip
dark
brown
with
garnet
edges
big
think
head
leaves
moderate
irregular
lacing
piney
hops
mix
with
toasty
dark
malt
aromas
medium
heavy
body
with
high
carbonation
dark
burnt
malts
dominate
the
taste
with
a
grassy
hop
finish
mild
sweetness
a
pleasant
enough
beer
but
not
a
standout

o
i
think
that
porters
are
my
favorite
style
to
drink
especially
with
a
meal
and
black
ipas
are
a
close
second
really
liked
this
version
and
will
seek
it
out
in
bottles
when
it
comes
to
chicago
what
a
weird
beer
only
firestone
walker
it
did
grow
on
me
as
it
warmed
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
good
beer
keeps
me
hopeful
that
this
style
doesnt
entirely
suck
arrrrrrr
650
ml
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
decent
sized
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
large
amount
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
grapefruit
pine
tobacco
light
roastiness
some
tangerine
and
a
bit
of
rye
the
taste
has
some
sweetness
with
tangerines
a
rye
twang
some
grapefruit
and
a
bit
of
pine
the
finish
has
a
decent
bitterness
with
some
lingering
rye
spiciness
medium
body
medium
carbonation
quite
enjoyable
certainly
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
that
ive
had
i
liked
that
it
didnt
have
a
lot
of
roastiness
and
enjoyed
the
rye
perhaps
a
touch
too
sweet
a
very
drinkable
example
of
the
style
uniquely
crafted
and
startlingly
freshtasting
stones
ddh
sumblimely
self
righteous
ale
bests
it
but
fw
has
produced
a
solid
contender
for
topofthepack
for
the
style
overall
i
think
the
crew
hit
this
right
on
the
head
the
rye
and
citrus
combo
really
worked
here
firestone
deserves
the
accolades
they
receive
and
i
cant
wait
for
the
next
new
batch
from
these
winners
this
is
still
a
great
beer
o
no
doubt
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
personally
i
have
never
found
black
ipas
to
my
liking
and
ive
always
found
the
charred
grain
super
piney
hops
flavor
combination
to
be
a
little
abrasive
personal
tastes
aside
a
quality
brew
overall
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
black
ipa
and
certainly
worth
a
taste
o
the
hops
overshadow
everything
just
like
a
good
black
ipa
should
roasted
malts
are
just
barely
detectable
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
awesome
because
it
is
an
ipa
first
and
a
dark
roasted
beer
second
and
not
just
a
hoppy
stout
a
great
black
ipa
a
great
american
dark
ale
yeah
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
very
dark
brown
fine
two
finger
light
brown
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
aroma
is
fantastic
light
roasted
malt
and
nice
herbal
and
piney
hops
flavor
is
complex
herbal
hops
citrus
roasted
malt
tropical
fruit
the
hops
are
not
intense
but
very
fresh
tasting
an
unusually
well
balanced
ale
between
hops
and
malt
medium
bodied
with
pleasant
creaminess
this
is
an
excellent
black
ale
that
leans
more
towards
an
ipa
although
the
roasted
malt
is
still
present
o
very
solid
beer
best
thing
ive
tried
from
firestone
some
real
good
stuff
here
really
didnt
want
to
let
my
last
bottle
go
as
an
extra
in
the
last
trade
but
spread
the
wealth
thats
what
i
always
say
when
its
a
choice
at
least
not
when
its
being
forced
upon
you
the
body
was
just
a
touch
fuller
than
is
typical
for
the
style
and
the
beer
benefited
greatly
drinkability
was
excellent
i
finished
the
22
and
found
myself
wanting
another
overall
an
excellent
brew
easily
the
best
cda
ive
yet
had
this
is
a
must
try
beer
but
make
sure
you
buy
a
couple
bottles
you
are
going
to
want
them
overall
this
is
pretty
damn
good
and
crushable
im
not
sure
i
like
it
better
than
black
top
but
im
a
little
giddy
school
girl
for
that
little
minx
firestone
walker
remains
in
my
wheelhouse
of
good
times
taste
mouthfeel
very
tropical
citrusy
completely
hopforward
a
touch
of
sweetness
upfront
but
ultimately
dry
and
lightbodied
the
finish
brings
out
the
roasted
malt
and
earthy
rye
along
with
a
sticky
resinous
bitterness
the
contrast
between
sweeter
tropical
fruit
flavors
black
malt
and
rye
is
unusual
but
works
very
well
overall
i
tried
this
for
the
first
time
last
year
and
was
utterly
blown
away
by
the
rough
around
the
edges
yet
truly
balanced
flavor
profile
of
this
complex
and
interesting
brew
i
would
love
to
see
firestone
put
this
beer
on
oak
for
a
couple
of
weeks
highly
recommended
to
any
beer
lover
o
a
really
good
good
black
ipa
that
leaves
a
nice
taste
in
your
mouth
and
for
5
99
well
worth
it
i
support
this
beer
as
a
top
tier
black
ipa
overall
this
is
a
wellbalanced
american
black
ale
i
could
quaff
tons
of
it
very
intense
beer
not
smooth
intense
maybe
after
this
mellows
it
could
be
an
overall
4
5
but
a
little
too
harsh
right
now
o
most
excellent
overall
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
it
just
did
not
mesh
at
all
it
did
mellow
a
bit
as
i
drank
it
but
still
was
overly
abrasive
and
unbalanced
with
offnotes
good
tasting
beer
overall
which
is
what
id
expect
from
firestone
would
definitely
try
it
again
o
a
roasted
hoppy
delight
overall
this
is
the
first
good
beer
i
have
had
since
i
cam
back
form
afghanistan
and
i
am
glad
that
it
was
i
cant
think
of
a
better
way
to
welcome
myself
back
into
the
world
of
amazing
beer
than
with
a
beer
like
this
o
ive
really
been
looking
forward
to
this
one
being
released
and
i
was
not
disappointed
a
very
easy
drinking
black
ipa
no
hint
of
alcohol
great
hop
character
and
the
rye
compliments
it
very
nicely
ive
had
a
lot
of
rye
ales
where
the
rye
is
just
too
over
powering
imo
firestone
has
found
a
perfect
balance
cheers
d
glad
to
try
overall
this
was
excellent
i
think
i
have
new
clear
favorite
black
ipa
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
firestone
the
taste
is
not
at
all
what
i
expected
the
carbonation
intially
fills
my
mouth
as
it
dissipates
the
spicy
hops
and
rye
flavor
take
over
there
are
other
hops
but
they
definitly
take
the
back
the
flavor
finishes
with
a
smooth
bitter
and
dryness
on
the
tongue
that
is
almost
smoky
nice
again
fw
puts
out
a
topnotch
worldclass
american
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brownish
black
color
which
appears
to
have
a
ruby
hue
when
held
up
to
the
light
large
cream
colored
head
scent
is
nice
and
roasty
some
roasted
malt
with
burnt
toast
aromas
and
a
nice
little
hop
profile
going
on
a
bit
of
citrus
with
more
roasted
malt
taste
is
initially
hoppy
with
more
of
an
ipa
side
than
a
stout
side
definitely
makes
you
wonder
how
they
can
make
something
so
hoppy
so
dark
just
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
grain
with
a
tiny
bit
of
char
but
other
than
that
its
citrusy
hoppy
and
bitter
maybe
a
bit
of
dark
chocolate
but
you
really
have
to
hunt
for
it
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
crisp
bitter
finish
drinkability
is
high
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
overall
a
solid
beer
from
an
awesome
brewery
that
never
really
seems
to
fail
quite
unique
a
rather
delightful
bipa
theyre
not
my
favorite
but
if
they
were
all
like
wookey
bipas
would
grow
on
me
rapidly
recommended
ogreat
addition
to
the
fw
line
up
this
beers
really
does
it
for
me
and
will
be
a
regular
in
the
fw
rotation
well
done
overall
quite
nice
if
you
like
the
style
id
have
it
again
i
really
like
how
the
spice
in
the
hop
and
malt
character
is
balanced
by
the
fruit
and
pine
characteristics
of
the
hops
it
is
a
fantastic
brew
that
almost
perfectly
balances
all
elements
my
favorite
american
black
ale
drink
it
was
good
but
i
wanted
more
i
wanted
to
be
blown
away
had
some
good
flavors
but
was
a
bit
bigger
than
i
anticipated
it
being
i
did
like
the
rye
forward
approach
but
just
needed
to
be
a
bit
better
o
well
i
wasnt
expecting
to
like
it
nearly
this
much
the
beer
is
decadent
and
definitely
hop
forward
that
instantly
makes
the
case
that
half
of
people
will
like
it
and
half
wont
i
know
lots
of
people
that
dont
like
hop
forward
abas
so
they
probably
wont
like
this
showing
but
perhaps
the
solid
rye
presence
will
win
you
over
like
it
won
me
over
t
starts
soft
and
sweet
with
mango
and
honey
and
some
faint
citrus
hop
notes
finish
brings
darker
flavors
of
roasted
malt
anise
coffee
and
char
theres
a
lingering
sweetness
throughout
that
isnt
helped
by
the
seeming
lack
of
carbonation
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
my
thing
doa
my
only
complaint
is
that
the
head
was
rather
thin
and
dissipated
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
along
the
sides
verdict
fantastic
black
ipa
especially
for
being
their
first
widely
available
beer
of
this
style
the
flavors
are
dank
bitter
and
balanced
well
with
a
great
body
which
makes
for
a
great
drinking
experience
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
out
there
hit
the
shelves
today
had
to
buy
one
poured
to
pint
glass
the
beer
arrives
a
deep
dark
black
color
with
dark
brown
mahagoney
edges
in
the
light
a
nice
2
finger
mocha
head
with
excellent
retention
and
leaves
gobs
of
lacing
throughout
the
nose
is
big
with
citrus
hops
rye
spice
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malts
inviting
similarly
the
taste
starts
off
with
a
big
citrus
hops
flavor
that
blends
to
a
medium
bitterness
rye
spice
and
roasted
malt
the
rye
and
citrus
work
very
well
together
and
the
hint
of
roast
finishes
everything
off
well
good
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
day
a
very
well
done
aba
and
one
i
would
look
forward
to
enjoying
again
definitely
a
more
hopforward
example
of
this
style
with
the
rye
being
a
pleasant
compliment
and
just
enough
roast
to
make
it
fit
the
style
o
i
was
hoping
for
more
but
this
was
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
overall
nice
beer
but
i
like
a
little
more
roasty
malts
like
others
of
the
style
overall
i
will
be
drinking
this
beer
again
i
wont
be
buying
other
firestonewalker
beers
since
i
find
them
to
be
a
bit
weak
but
hopefully
this
is
a
trend
that
they
will
keep
going
with
their
upcoming
brews
poured
a
dark
porter
like
thickness
with
limited
light
coming
through
i
was
very
impressed
with
its
dark
reddish
brown
color
the
lacing
wasnt
much
to
look
at
neither
was
the
head
the
smell
was
that
of
an
imperial
ipa
hops
citrus
floral
not
so
much
rye
though
very
attractive
smell
though
the
taste
was
incredible
normaly
rye
beers
for
me
arent
as
big
a
hit
for
me
but
this
one
hit
home
the
taste
is
that
of
caramel
hops
floral
citrus
notes
with
a
bit
of
burnt
aftertaste
mouthfeel
isnt
anything
special
but
it
doesnt
detract
just
something
i
wouldnt
say
adds
overall
i
would
definitely
pick
this
beer
up
again
and
if
i
ever
saw
it
on
tap
somewhere
it
would
be
the
first
beer
i
tried
there
o
yet
another
winner
from
firestone
walker
good
beer
and
one
that
im
hoping
becomes
a
yearround
offering
great
compliment
to
double
jack
and
a
very
good
rye
black
ipa
well
worth
the
effort
to
seek
out
a
fun
beer
cant
wait
to
find
it
in
bottles
o
fresh
on
tap
is
good
would
like
to
see
how
this
is
from
the
bottle
should
be
a
yearround
offering
pretty
darn
good
i
had
this
beer
at
the
slo
xtreme
beerfest
it
pours
a
dark
brownalmost
black
with
glints
of
red
in
the
light
a
tantaupe
head
no
head
retention
which
is
not
unusual
for
firestone
walker
creations
the
color
is
misleading
as
the
bouquet
has
a
resiny
hop
character
perfectly
carbonated
in
fact
the
ties
the
resiny
hop
with
the
rye
flavor
with
a
very
smooth
transition
not
sure
if
that
was
intended
or
if
it
occurred
serendipitously
either
way
it
works
nose
of
fresh
hop
chocolate
and
hazelnuts
in
mouth
its
so
wellbalanced
great
hop
taste
with
roasted
malts
aroma
final
of
chocolate
nuts
wood
very
refreshing
one
of
my
best
black
ipa
so
far
my
least
favorite
from
a
recent
hill
farmstead
growler
party
a
good
beer
but
seemed
more
of
a
smoked
black
ale
than
the
black
ipa
style
printed
on
the
growler
tag
juicy
a
little
roasty
great
smell
this
tops
blakkr
as
my
favorite
ipa
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
these
this
is
good
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
black
ipa
i
really
enjoy
the
mix
between
hoppy
and
roasty
and
james
does
it
well
very
drinkable
4
5
overall
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
but
certainly
nowhere
in
the
upper
echelon
of
shaun
hill
brews
pour
is
creamy
black
with
a
very
tight
light
caramel
head
that
just
doesnt
move
huge
roasted
malt
presence
with
light
notes
of
citrus
behind
taste
has
a
rich
malt
balance
with
strong
roasted
flavors
hops
arent
a
huge
centerpiece
here
at
all
some
citrusy
hops
through
the
finish
not
acrid
or
bitter
at
all
good
soft
feel
a
touch
of
creaminess
to
it
carbonation
is
fairly
strong
with
a
good
clean
finish
another
solid
effort
from
hf
quality
black
ipa
well
worth
trying
a
wonderful
black
ipa
good
to
see
that
in
the
fridge
the
hf
750ml
lasts
at
least
a
week
i
wouldnt
push
it
after
their
best
by
date
7
days
but
i
dont
see
much
changing
for
even
a
few
days
past
it
shauns
system
of
fresh
hoppy
growlers
always
produces
great
results
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
would
be
thinking
great
ipa
first
and
then
the
black
malts
secondly
keep
up
the
good
work
reminds
me
alot
of
their
other
black
ipa
foster
just
enough
blackness
to
let
you
know
its
there
accompanied
by
loads
of
great
hops
this
one
is
probably
even
hoppier
its
good
but
maybe
wouldve
liked
to
see
something
differentmore
balanced
with
this
time
around
o
definitely
more
of
a
black
ipa
than
just
a
black
ale
but
definitely
ok
by
me
if
you
read
my
reviews
you
know
thats
one
of
my
favorite
styles
im
really
glad
they
brewed
this
again
now
lets
hope
for
another
batch
of
jimmy
glad
to
catch
this
on
tap
at
the
blackback
as
hill
farmstead
had
kicked
it
by
the
time
i
went
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
layer
of
off
white
head
the
nose
is
full
of
citrus
peel
hops
there
is
just
a
touch
of
roast
the
flavor
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
just
a
touch
of
roast
with
a
nice
citrus
peel
hop
note
the
finish
is
bitter
but
smooth
the
finish
is
quite
dry
overall
excellent
love
how
hoppy
it
is
really
impressive
poured
out
as
a
rich
looking
deep
brown
color
what
essentially
looks
black
in
the
glass
there
is
a
very
nice
creamy
tan
head
on
top
that
leaves
a
great
lacing
and
a
pretty
strong
retention
also
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
really
nice
balance
of
roasted
malts
and
aromatic
hops
very
nicely
done
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
also
quite
good
the
malts
again
balance
out
flawlessly
with
the
hops
being
used
in
this
one
chocolate
roasted
flavors
with
the
subtle
bite
of
pine
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
pretty
smooth
its
medium
bodied
with
a
healthy
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
cant
find
much
to
really
complain
about
here
served
in
a
hill
farmstead
tulip
at
the
blackback
pours
an
inky
black
with
a
halfinch
light
tan
froth
embedded
with
tiny
ringlets
delicate
spots
and
sheets
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
reminiscent
of
french
roast
coffee
with
some
earthy
bitterness
also
present
in
the
mix
taste
follows
nose
however
the
flavor
profile
comes
off
a
bit
thin
and
watery
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
an
even
carbonation
but
it
comes
off
a
little
on
the
thin
side
overall
a
solid
example
of
the
style
but
not
as
robust
as
it
could
be
in
my
opinion
incredibly
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
o
great
beer
the
mix
of
hops
is
unique
and
the
smooth
roasted
malt
makes
for
a
great
balance
o
i
like
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
most
of
the
other
hill
farmstead
beers
as
i
feel
like
its
too
hoppy
for
a
black
ipa
but
maybe
thats
my
taste
its
worth
a
try
but
would
not
be
a
go
to
for
me
as
someone
who
gets
to
try
a
lot
of
hfs
dark
brownblack
pour
looked
to
lack
most
haze
but
was
still
nearly
opaque
a
small
beige
head
sank
to
a
small
ringlet
leaving
streaks
of
lacing
on
the
glass
piney
hops
dominant
in
the
nose
mixed
with
some
chocolaty
malts
touches
of
citrus
zest
pretty
typical
of
the
style
similar
taste
plenty
of
hops
mostly
pine
some
citrus
roasted
dark
malts
cocoa
toasted
grains
medium
body
decent
balance
its
hard
to
get
too
much
variety
with
this
style
but
that
doesnt
mean
there
arent
good
ones
and
bad
ones
this
one
was
pretty
good
it
is
hf
after
all
growler
poured
a
clear
deep
black
color
ale
with
a
large
dirty
brown
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
good
lacing
aroma
of
piney
hops
is
incredibly
intense
with
great
floral
qualities
taste
is
a
mix
between
roasted
malt
notes
with
light
bitter
and
dry
notes
submerged
by
a
huge
amount
of
piney
hops
with
some
citrus
notes
body
is
average
with
good
carbonation
this
a
great
demonstration
on
how
dryhopping
should
be
done
to
limit
the
bitterness
of
hops
but
ensure
floral
piney
notes
are
prevalent
o
im
beginning
to
think
hf
can
do
almost
any
style
of
beer
almost
perfectly
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
nicely
balanced
between
all
of
the
flavors
that
a
black
ipa
should
have
i
could
easily
knock
back
a
few
glasses
of
these
i
definitely
recommend
trying
it
oa
good
black
ale
but
lacked
a
little
depth
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
pretty
enjoyable
a
good
one
to
grab
when
its
around
this
is
medium
bodied
with
smooth
carbonation
i
like
this
one
a
lot
but
its
hard
to
emphasize
the
hops
in
a
black
ale
this
one
falls
a
little
short
of
greatness
it
is
still
a
great
drink
and
goes
down
quickly
had
some
roasty
coffee
and
chocolate
at
the
start
soon
after
came
some
rindy
citrus
with
bitter
piney
pithy
characteristics
quite
flavorful
a
solid
bipa

overall
a
real
fun
beer
perhaps
not
my
favorite
but
a
really
well
made
the
beer
appears
black
with
a
thick
tan
head
long
lasting
retention
with
copious

hill
farmstead
beers
are
beautiful
the
aroma
brings
roast
pine
a
hint
of
chocolate
nice
flavor
well
balanced
with
a
healthy
pine
bitterness
on
top
of
a
roasted

medium
bodied
with
lingering
chocolate
in
the
finish
a
solid
beer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
black
back
pub
an
ipa
that
happens
to
have
a
shwartzbier
elementresinypiney
chocolate
stoutish
and
grapefruit
dark
body
and
some
lace
hops
and
some
roast
aroma
the
roast
was
lightly
done
which
was
nice
to
drink
average
mouthfeel
overall
a
great
black
ipa
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
i
was
impressed
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
short
tan
head
its
nose
has
grass
roasted
malts
some
light
fruit
sipping
this
and
it
tastes
of
big
roasted
malts
followed
by
chocolate
and
and
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
nearly
medium
a
fairly
crisp
finish
it
drinks
very
easily
and
makes
for
a
great
growler
fill
especially
with
being
under
7
abv
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
hill
farmstead
beers
its
very
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
had
this
on
tap
at
several
bars
in
montpelier
when
i
was
there
a
couple
months
ago
this
pint
was
poured
from
a
growler
a
friend
got
me
on
a
recent
trip
to
the
brewery
drink
overall
this
beer
really
was
amazing
the
appearance
was
magical
and
the
feel
was
the
stuff
of
legend
a
truly
great
black
ipa
this
is
what
brewers
should
strive
for
every
hoppy
beer
that
i
have
tried
from
hill
farmstead
has
been
phenomenal
and
james
proves
that
statement
true
regardless
of
what
malt
is
used
d
this
is
exactly
how
i
like
my
black
ipas
hopefully
john
kimmich
makes
el
jefe
again
so
that
i
can
do
a
sidebyside
showdown
between
these
two
beers
ill
probably
trade
for
this
one
in
the
future
as
i
really
enjoyed
it
pours
a
clear
dark
brown
near
black
with
a
bubbly
tan
ruby
tinged
head
aroma
is
resin
pine
roast
malt
and
light
citrus
hops
mouthfeel
is
suffering
a
little
from
sitting
on
this
growler
for
too
long
light
carbonation
on
a
medium
thick
body
with
a
slightly
watery
finish
much
less
roast
in
the
flavor
than
the
nose
pine
hops
dominate
bitter
and
resiny
with
light
citrus
in
the
finish
aftertaste
lingers
more
malty
than
the
body
with
soft
roast
and
light
chocolate
having
had
this
fresh
i
wont
ding
the
mouthfeel
from
this
sample
one
of
my
favorite
black
ipas
i
think
the
time
in
the
growler
has
hurt
the
mouth
feel
in
this
one
it
comes
across
aa
little
flat
still
very
nice
overall
and
id
love
the
chance
to
try
this
fresh
out
of
the
tap
wow
another
masterpiece
by
hill
farmstead
reminds
me
of
dark
element
from
element
brewing
but
teeters
more
to
the
hoppy
end
of
the
spectrum
o
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
cant
emphasize
enough
how
i
enjoyed
the
balance
between
hops
and
roast
it
really
makes
this
black
ale
easy
to
drink
and
that
much
more
enjoyable
recommend
o
overall
this
was
a
tasty
black
ale
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
dark
roasted
malts
though
as
opposed
to
the
hops
overall
really
solid
black
ipa
overall
pretty
good
less
of
the
darker
malts
and
more
of
the
big
bitter
hops
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
maybe
what
i
should
have
expeccted
from
hill
farmstead
a
taste
drinkable
beer
but
less
dark
malts
than
i
expected
o
brilliant
black
ipa
could
use
more
roast
character
but
i
love
the
hop
profile
m
medium
bodied
low
carbonation
starts
off
bitter
and
wet
with
mostly
bittering
hops
flows
into
bitter
and
sweet
with
pine
hops
notes
and
some
slight
dark
malts
and
finishes
bitter
and
slightly
dry
with
chocolate
roasted
malts
and
a
wallop
of
pine
and
earthy
hop
notes
o
overall
very
solid
black
ale
quite
delicious
o
superb
beer
from
hill
farmstead
cant
wait
to
start
seeing
this
on

in
boston
pours
a
dark
charcoal
color
with
nice
cap
of
dense
khaki
brown
froth
good
retention
and

is
a
perfect
balance
of
roasted
grain
and
piney
and
fruity
hops
nose
brings
out
more
fruit
towards
the
end
with
some
tropical
notes

did
with

light
char
with
a

plenty

immediately
coutered
by

the
roasty
malt
is
minimal
and
is
actually
used
to
counterbalance
the
hops
subtle
toasty
bread
chocolate

this
beer
is
all
about
the
sweet

flavor
only
slightly
bitter
with
some
earthy
pine
as
well
as
some

this
was
a
really
interstig

one
of
the
better

ibe
had
very
nice
beer
with
some
very
interesting
and
complex

would
definitely
seek
out
again
a

to

would

as

its

right
off
the

is

its

quite

very
similar
to
a
good
american
ipa
with
a
nice

the
taste
is
quite
roasty
and
a

grainy
i
get
this
from
all
black
ipas
and
im
not
a
big
fan
of
it
but
it
seems
to
just
be
inherent
in
the
style
there
hop
flavors
are
well
balanced
with
the
dark
malts
and
the
citrus
and
mango
flavors
come
through
well
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
a
black
ipa
that
ive
had
to
date
pours
a
deep
dark
color
that
verges
on

a
singlefinger

and
some
nice

the
aroma
hits
the
parameters
of
the
newlyformed
style
head
on
with
some
really
resinous
piney
hops
as
well
as
some
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
hoppy
with
some
mild
roast
the
feel
has
a
great
combination
of
roasted
malt
and
pinebased
hops
this
drinks
quite

is

really

pretty

but
probably
more
of
a
hoppy

than
an
ipa
overall
an
interesting
venture
on
the
black
ipa
style
by
adding
coffee
bean
i
found
the
hops
to
be
pretty
subdued
in
the
aromas
but
quickly
turned
around
in
the
taste
some
minor
tweaks
to
allow
the
hops
to
shine
in
the
aroma
would
make
this
a
true
stand

very
good

a

heavy
in
my
opinion
for
an
ipa
in
general
but
saved
by
a
nice
hoppy
finish
there
are
better
black
ipas
but
i
would
revisit
this
one
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
from
clown
shoes
thus
far
good
dark
smokey
flavors
and
very
drinkable
body
o
very
nice
vigorous
yet
balanced
looks
great
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
are
a
fantastic
blend
of
bitter
aromatic
hops
and
dark
malt
characteristics
underpinned
by
delicate
yeast
the
flavour
elements
simultaneously
compete
and
complement
each
other
a
skillful
combination
lovely
body
excellent
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
tried
well

sampling
if
you
have
the
chance

very
similar
bitter
chocolate
earthygardenness
roasted
malt
almost
bell
pepper
notes
very
creamy
mouthfeel
with
a
nicely
smooth
and
cloyingly
dry
aftertaste
would
be
able
to
drink
more
than
one
without
it
overpowering
the
palate
very
nice
beer
and
a
unique
take
on
the
style
more
chocolateroasted
malt
as
well
as
more
of
a
drying
finish
than
most
black
ipas
ive
tried
but
also
with
a
strangelynicely
creamy
mouthfeel
when
oxygenated
in
the
mouth
this
is
an
american
style
so
it
is
ok
that
it
is
over
the
top
try
this
you
might
like
it
more
than
i
do
it
is
a
well
crafted
brew
just
not
my
cup
of
ale
this
pours
deep
and
dark
black
you
might
say
a
nice
dark
khaki
head
the
aroma
previews
some
hops
but
not
as
strong
as
my
west
coast
brands
do
and
then
the
coffee
not
malt
coffee
the
taste
was
the
surprising
but
dare
i
say
awesome
combination
of
an
ipa
and
a
stout
my
hometown
favs
do
this
thing
where
they
bring
the
hops
and
the
dark
sweet
malts
in
big
numbers
this
did
the
ipastout
combo
and
nailed
it
aroma
is
citrusy
and
extremely
chocolatey
notes
of
tangerine
and
mango
are
evident
initially
with
hints
of
resin
and
cannabis
accompanying
lightly
roasted
malt
flavor
reveals
grapefruit
and
mango
at
the
base
which
is
contrasted
by
lightly
sweet
chocolate
malt
becoming
roasty
bitter
and
resiny
in
the
finish
the
sharp
citrus
notes
clash
with
the
roast
malt
bitterness
but
the
fruity
character
and
chocolate
are
welcome
sensations
in
and
of
themselves
black
ipas
can
be
hit
or
miss
the
sum
of
the
parts
is
greater
than
the
whole
in
this
instance
its
more
bitter
than
i
prefer
single
bottle
from
a
4pack
decanted
into
a
tulip
glass
nearly
pitch

a

might

this

ipa
like
this
brewers
galactica
ipa
there
are
a
few
rough
edges
but
the
potent
flavors
nevertheless
deliver
the
goods
some
wood
char
is
apparent
and
serves
to
cut
the
sweetness
on
the
nose
decent
balance
between
citruspine
hops
and
dark
malts
perhaps
the
latter
have
a
slight
edge
although
the
hopping
is
far
from
subtle
moderate
carbonation
perhaps
just
on
the
low
end
decent
full
body
and
a
roasted
yet
green
finish
with
a
pleasing
floral
perfume
high
price
point
for
these
4packs
here
and
one
can
debate
whether
the
execution
justifies
the
price
of
acquisition
probably
an
approachable
and
drinkable
version
of
a
style
to
which
im
still
coming
around
the

i
poured

an
a
certainly
one
of
the
better
black
ales
ive
had
in
recent
memory
while
i
am
enjoying
this
glass
of
hoppy
feet
the
beer
itself
is
pushing
7
months
of
age
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
hop
profile
has
suffered
as
a
result
considering
both
of
those
facts
ill
more
than
likely
revisit
this
one
at
some
point
when
i
find
a
younger
bottle
and
adjust
the
score
accordingly
my
first
black
ipa
the
style
is
complex
and
interesting
this
was
like
drinking
a
black
and
tan
made
from
a
porter
and
an
ipa
delicious
and
worth
the
experience
o
this
beer
is
a
bit
challenging
and
confusing
at
first
but
this
of
the
most
interesting
beers
ive
tried
its
like
drinking
two
beers
at
the
same
time
you
get
the
citrusy
hops
like
a
ipa
then
the
caramelized
maltiness
and
richness
of
a
stout
drinks
like
an
ale
with
stouty
goodness
a
pretty
good
offering
its
hoppy
packs
a
punch
with
regards
to
bitterness
i
enjoyed
with
one
particularly
because
the
balance
was
good
with
the
hop
bitterness
the
darker
malts
working
well
together
this
had
booze
for
sure
but
it
didnt
detract
from
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
i
could
only
feel
a
slight
warming
once
i
polished
this
off
the
recessed
dark
fruit
tones
were
enhanced
licorice
sweetness
that
tied
everything
together
without
making
this
seem
artificial
or
not
true
to
style
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
and
as
this
warmed
up
it
grew
nicely
on
me
a
good
take
on
the
style
thats
easy
to
enjoy
yearround
and
possibly
the
best
current
offering
from
clown
shoes
dark
ale
with
a
thin
dissipating
head
notes
of
caramel
malt
on
the
nose
some
sweetness
is
offset
by
mild
bitterness
tabacco
notes
reminicient
of
a
porter
a
decent
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
remarkable
here
not
sure
if
i
am
a
fan
of
the
dark
ipa
style
o
one
of
the
moremost
powerfully
hoppy
black
ipas

at

able
to
see
some
very
tiny
bubbles
breaking

surface
too
while
the
nose
offers
a
zesty
orange
citrus
spritz
as
well
as
damp
earthiness
the
cocoa

vanilla

things
after
that

bready
any
foundational
grassiness
cloaked

rises
through
the
finish
nice
how
the
palate
weight
remains
after
the
flavors
release
its
very
well
made
but
not
something
many
could
pound
all
night
overall
this
ipa
was
pretty
good
must
drink
it
fresh
i
drank
it
slightly
aged
and
thought
it
was
horrible
an
excellent
black
ipa
o
strongly
flavored
black
ipa
with
hoppy
if
not
happy
feet
overall
a
great
black
ale
very
different
to
most
of
the
black
ales
i
have
had
more
nuances
to
this
one
and
richer
well
worth
the
slightly
over
au100
a
case
price
the
bitterness
roars
forward
in
the
first
few
sips
after
my
palate
enjoys
the
dark
sweet
malt
character
at
the
beginning
highly
balanced
and
quite
drinkable
o
first
time
trying
a
beer
from
this
brewery
and
was
definitely
impressed
with
this
black
ipa
a
well
balanced
brew
with
good
flavor
and
good
hop
kick
definitely
will
be
trying
more
of
there
beers
nice
enjoyable
beer
to
sip
on
one
bottle
is
the
right
amount
for
me
in
one
sitting
o
fullflavored
balanced
black
ipa
my
first
experience
with
a
clown
shoes
product
and
it
was
definitely
a
good
one
this
ale
pours
a
hearty
cola
color
with
a
thick
tan
head
which
lasts
longer
than
most
black
ipas
there
is
substantial
lacing
and
a
nice
mouth
coating
chewiness
to
this
ale
the
aroma
is
malty
sweet
and
hoppy
bitter
with
a
blend
of
floral
citrus
notes
and
a
deep
smoky
coffee
smell
the
flavor
follows
suit
a
perfect
blend
of
the
hoppy
bitterness
of
an
ipa
and
the
sweet
smoky
maltiness
of
a
porter
this
is
everything
i
want
and
expect
from
a
black
ipa
may
have
even
surpassed
sublimely
self
righteous
as
my
new
favorite
black
ipa
cant
wait
to
try
the
bottle
of
hoppy
feet
1
5
that
i
picked
up
at
the
same
time
after
having
the
hoppy
feet
1
5
and
thinking
it
was
great
i
was
very
disapointed
in
this
beer
the
flavors
just
dont
jive
together
very
well
overall
this
beers
taste
like
a
dark
alestouthybrid
its
true
to
its
name
it
is
bitterly
hoppy
totally
black
in
color
poured
with
a
short
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
that
left
fingers
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
dark
roasted
and
lightly
charred
malt
aromas
with
citrus
hops
and
touch
of
sweet
dark
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
rich
carbonation
through
the
middle
and
slick
oily
feel
at
the
end
dark
roasted
and
burnt
malt
flavors
up
front
with
a
touch
of
chocolate

hop
bitterness
builds
through
the
middle
with
a
hint
of
citrus
hop
underneath
well
balanced
aromas
intense
maltiness
and
flavorful
hoppiness
i
solid
black
ipa
the
mouthfeel
strikes
the
same
difficult
balance
found
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
its
dry
all
the
way
toasty
and
almost
chalky
but
also
bright
the
medium
body
works
for
both
elements
and
the
crispness
is
good
for
an
ipa
without
clashing
against
the
roastier
character
its
also
got
a
nice
smoothness
from
beginning
to
end
overall
no
decipherable
freshness
date
i
found
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
held
at
a
specific
angle

a
close

anyone
know
so
unfortunately
i
cannot
cornfirm
if
this
is
just
an
old
bottle
or
just
a
beer
that
isnt
quite
my
ideal
cda
a
bigger
hop
bite
would
be
nice
o
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
that
ive
head
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
play
very
nicely
together
neither
character
overwhelms
the
other
and
the
lightness
of
the
body
really
adds
to
my
enjoyment
of
the
bee
a
well
crafted
brew
to
be
sure
nice
and
smooth
much
lighter
tasting
than
the
malt
shows
as
the
the
look
is
a
straight
flat
black
very
way
to
drink
yet
doesnt
stand
out
as
a
powerhouse
overall
impression
a
distinctively
american
hopped
black
ale
the
hops
are
in
charge
with
enough
malt
character
to
keep
it
interesting
but
definitely
plays
a
background
supportive
role
worth
trying
hoppy
feet
is
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
a
flagship
beer
any
brewery
would
be
lucky
to
have
this
is
a
very
solid
black
ipa
theres
alot
to
like
about
it
i
do
like
it
but
it
leaves
me
wanting
a
little
more
from
it
i
do
appreciate
it
though
its
pretty
good
overall
poured
into
a
stone
brewery

a
very
dark

with

of

malt
body
is
slightly
light
to
support
the
coffee
and
hop
bitterness
making
the
finish
a
bit
dry
and
less
balanced
but
still
an
enjoyable
black
ale
that
hits
all
the
right
notes
o
a
great
bipa
very
bitter
and
hoppy
with
nice
coffee
tones
bitter
yet
smooth
overall
a
nice
beer
really
is
a
mix
of
stout
and
ipa
with
excellent
amount
of
added
sweetness
to
really
make
it
a
enjoyable
brew
the
coffee
aspect
mixed
with
the
hops
might
be
a
little
too
bitter
for
some
but
other
then
that
a
soild
beer
im
really
liking
their
labels
and
the
concept
and
the
fact
started
on
sort
of
a
joke
brewing
this
black
ipa
sometimes
you
stumble
onto
something
good
these
guys
are
contract
brewed
at
mercury
brewing
in
ipswich
ma
this
pours
pitch
black
and
meets
the
perfect
mix
of
dark
porter
and
hefty
balls
out
ipa
dark
tan
khaki
head
almost
pitch
black
body
except
for
some
ruby
highlights
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
aroma
has
herbal
pine
and
citric
notes
amongst
a
back
drop
of
dark
malts
roasted
dark
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
im
liking
the
marriage
of
the
two
i
know
this
style
but
its
been
awhile
since
ive
had
a
really
well
balanced
version
of
the
cascadian
black
ale
or
black
ipa
in
the
nose
im
even
getting
hints
of
licorice
and
salted
caramel
dont
call
me
crazy
im
seriously
getting
a
mix
of
those
aromas
flavor
is
dry
dark
roasted
malts
with
hints
of
cocoa
and
nearly
burnt
espresso
big
vegetal
bitter
earthy
notes
reign
supreme
with
citrus
peel
and
pine
cone
needles
kicking
in
theres
a
bit
of
a
hop
assault
here
however
the
dark
creamy
chocolate
notes
take
on
some
of
the
harshness
and
im
left
finishing
this
beer
at
a
surprisingly
quick
rate
carbonation
is
dead
on
mellow
but
carries
the
resinous
hops
quite
well
medium
to
full
bodied
range
leaves
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
between
sips
with
hop
burps
to
follow
overall
quite
an
impressive
beer
that
i
can
appreciate
the
complexity
of
all
the
elements
that
and
the
fact
that
it
hit
at
exactly
the
right
time
around
the
height
of
the
black
ipa
craze
a
couple
years
ago
reminds
me
of
a
stout
with
some
hops
tossed
in
smooth
rich
flavor
and
enjoyable
overall
admittedly
i
really
love
the
american
black
alecascadian
dark
aleblack
ipa
style
so
i
find
this
beer
to
be
outstanding
o
like
most
black
ales
its
several
things
what
a
tease

has

after

youre

of
tasting
all
that

poured

a

o
glad
they
distro
to
cali
now
if
youre
a
fan
of
black
ales
please
give
this
a
shot
not
the
best
but
a
nice
drinker
atmosphere
is
really
strong
great
foamy
tight
lingering
head
and
plenty
of
persistent

nose
is
a
great
combination
of
of
roasted

with

is
charred
and
wellbalanced
with
unsweetened
bitter
dark
chocolate
licorice
and
peat
with
a
nice
oaky
tone
earthy
and
hearty
but
a
bit
of
an
alkaline
character
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
decent
beer
and
a
fairly
average
example
of
the
style
it
looked
good
and
it
smelled
nice
but
when
it
got
the
taste
the
charred
malt
and
bitter
hops
showed
up
the
most
overpowering
the
roasty
and
citrus
aspects
that
i
like
the
most
in
the
style
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
wasnt
that
smooth
and
the
flavors
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
enough
for
me
i
feel
no
need
to
have
another
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
aroma
i
thought
they
were
both
nice
with
the
appearance
being
my
favorite
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
they
were
the
weak
point
of
this
beer
and
they
need
some
work
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
theres
many
other
black
ipas
i
enjoy
much
more
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
all
in
all
i
was
let
down
with
this
beer
clown
shoes
seems
to
be
pretty
good
with
hoppy
beers
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
and
i
thought
it
was
pretty
damn
rough
around
the
edges
better
luck
next
time
guys
so
far
this
is
my
least
favorite
beer
from
clown
shoes
o
very
solid
and
maybe
my
favorite
i
have
tried
from
this
style
which
is
not
my
first
choice
o
my
first
offering
from
this
brewery
not
too
shabby
pretty
darn
good
brew
poured
a
bit
cold
with
a
small
to
medium
size
thick
slightly
creamy
tan
head
that
soon
settled
to
a
light
cover
and
good
lacing
color
is
a
clear
very
dark
blackish
amber
brown
aroma
is
dark
roast
malt
molasses
dates
prunes
hint
of
hop
flavors
like
nose
fairly
dry
tang
and
bitter
are
predominant
suggestion
of
bitter
chocolate
and
none
of
that
is
overdone
body
and
carbonation
are
very
good
although
the
bittertang
strength
lends
to
some
sharpness
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
suggestion
of
alcohol
warmth
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
sweetness
taste
is
well
balanced
malts
and
hops
some
bitterness
a
bit
of
smoke
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
overall
not
dissapointed
a
great
brew
overall
a
decent
enough
offering
though
doubt
i
would
buy
a
sixpack
certianly
not
a
case
so
if
you
loooove
hops
and
arent
particular
how
interesting
the
beer
is
this
could
work
for
you
otherwise
if
someone
offers
you
it
at
a
party
you
should
enjoy
it
happily
otherwise
i
wouldnt
go
out
looking
for
it
o
an
enjoyable
dark
brew
but
in
the
end
lacked
the
hop
feel
and
complexity
of
a
great
black
ipa
t
a
little
faint
coming
out
of
the
gate
eventually
i
get
some
light
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
toasted
grain
with
a
big
push
of
grapefruit
hop
resin
in
the
background
the
resin
lingers
through
the
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
a
touch
unbalanced
but
not
a
bad
black
ipa
at
all
oactually
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
have
it
focuses
more
on
the
cocoa
than
the
hops
while
still
keeping
a
slight
hint
enough
to
keep
it
from
being
a
full
blown
porter
or
stout
i
recommend
this
this
is
a
serious
beer
but
not
an
intimidating
one
there
is
the
chalky
mouthfeel
however
this
simply
leads
to
a
more
substative
quaff
that
handles
all
its
ingredients
well
and
allows
for
one
sturdy
sessional
quaff
two
at
least
i
think
the
thing
that
comes
to
mind
most
about
this
beer
is
that
because
it
isnt
mindblowing
so
far
as
the
character
of
it
goes
some
might
consider
it
pedestrian
3
years
ago
people
would
have
committed
bloody
murder
to
try
this
one
with
all
the
black
ales
out
there
now
people
might
eh
this
one
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
black
ale
glad
to
finally
be
able
to
try
stuff
from
these
cats
out
of
12
ouncers
m
creamy
a
personal
requirement
for
me
when
it
comes
to
hoppy
black
ales
is
can
i
taste
the
black
in
this
case
i
definitely
can
it
adds
more
than
just
color
o
above
average
black
ipa
flavors
are
a
bit
confused
though
be
less
of
a
stout
and
let
the
hops
sing
overall
the
beer
has
bold
bitterness
that
is
not
pleasurable
pours
a
black
color
14
inch

good
retention
and

smells
of
citrus
hops
hint
of
pine
sweet
malt
hint
of
roasted
malt
hint
of
spice
and
a
hint
of
sugar
fits
the
style
of
an
american
black
ale
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
there
is
a
strong
bitterness
and
slight
dryness
tastes
of
hops
roasted
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
slight
grass
and
an
odd
grassspice
flavor
that
is
very
sharp
overall
the
bitterness
is
too
strong
and
the
accompanying
flavors
are
muted
or
overshadowed
o
a
fair
black
ale
its
to
style
but
a
little
clashing
in
flavours
an
ok
pickup
if
you
like
the
style
overall
i
like
my
black
ipas
to
balance
the
hops
to
roasty
malts
and
this
one
fails
pretty
hard
only
get
this
one
if
your
looking
for
some
serious
tongue
abuse
its
okay
nothing
that
i
would
buy
again
though
pours
an
opaque
black
with

foamy
dark

settles
to
a
partial
film
on

down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted

taste
is
much
the

with
cocoa
and

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
tasty
but
the
bitterness
lingers
long
after
each
sip
overall
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
a
bit
too
much
roast
and
tarry
notes
eeek
not
sure
this
can
get
a
recommendation
at
312oz
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
back
very
nice
black
ipablack
ale
glad
i
have
a
four
pack
will
certainly
check
out
more
from
clown
shoes
o
a
pretty
solid
bipa
offering
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
often
but
every
once
and
a
while
it
is
a
fantastic
brew
glad
i
didnt
spring
for
the
4
pack
a
fair
dark
ipa
too
much
biting
bitterness
in
the
taste
takes
away
from
an
otherwise
decent
though
unremarkable
brew
flavors
of
dark
roasted
malts
bitter
chocolate
carob
bitter
hops
cream
of
tartar
black
pepper
espresso
this
is
flavorful
and
bold
but
also
has
an
astringency
not
as
much
as
their
tramp
stamp
belgian
style
ipa
but
theres
still
a
rough
bite
relative
to
tommyknockers
hop
strike
this
is
good
but
not
something
id
want
a
growler
of
but
ive
bought
many
hop
strike
growlers
its
missing
the
smooth
drinkability
but
nevertheless
its
respectable
for
rough
beer
lovers
o
i
love
this
beer
and
thats
coming
from
a
guy
who
doesnt
particularly
treasure
this
style
clown
shoes
seems
to
have
an
incredible
grasp
on
the
beauty
of
natural
brewing
ingredients
and
for
that
theyve
instantly
gained
my
respect
and
attention
o
very
enjoyable
black
ipa
o
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
lifechanging
either
sound
drinkable
and
approachable
but
it
underachieves
especially
as
something
purporting
to
be
a
black
ipa
strikes
as
more
a
regular
stout
or
even
a
schwarzbier
so
in
summary
if
you
like
your
aba
with
extra
mint
and
tobacco
emphasis
this
ones
practically
made
for
you
overall
this
was
good
pretty
good
balance
of
flavors
over
all
a
greatly
done
black
ipa
very
balanced
and
well
made
kudos
clownshoes
my
first
beer
of
yours
didnt
disappoint
the
label
states
black
india
pale
ale
though
it
is
certainly
not
what
i
look
for
andor
expect
from
an
ipa
but
in
its
own
category
black
alelager
with
separate
style
expectations
this
is
very
good
its
easily
drinkable
provides
an
urge
to
fire
up
the
grill
for
some
barbecue
o
a
good
beer
but
it
is
more
on
the
stoutporter
side
than
ipa
side
the
little
bit
of
pine
and
the
bitter
hops
are
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
a
black
ipa
but
otherwise
the
flavors
werent
too
complex
owill
have
to
see
if
this
was
an
abberation
particularly
based
on
many
of
my
fellow
bas
whos
opinions
i
respect
o
excellent
looking
beer
the
taste
was
interesting
in
that
malt
didnt
appear
first
and
then
get
swept
away
with
hop
flavor
but
all
meshed
together
throughout
the
whole
taste
bitterness
overstayed
its
welcome
because
it
didnt
accompany
any
real
hop
flavors
that
long
after
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
and
a
grapefruit
aftertaste
i
recommend
trying
this
if
you
get
the
chance
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
clown
shoes
beers
o
this
is
a
well
made
bpa
im
really
beginning
to
see
the
subtle
differences
between
brewers
and
they
are
all
excellent
so
far
dark
bodied
beer
thin
brown
head
decent
retention
aroma
is
quite
nice
and
typical
of
a
well
done
black
ipa
chocolate
and
roast
mix
with
juicy
citrusy
hops
quite
nice
flavor
foundation
is
layed
down
quite
nicely
with
the
chocolatecaramel
malts
while
hop
notes
of
citrus
pine
and
resin
tap
dance
all
over
it
moderately
carbonated
and
medium
to
mediumfull
bodied
nicely
done
nice
little
intro
to
clown
shoes
for
me
overall
a
delicious
black
ipa
that
im
happy
to
see
on
the
shelves
here
in
minnesota
smooth
rich
and
malty
mashes
up
with
leafy
green
and
hoppy
bitter
much
just
enough
o
a
solid
black
ipa
that
has
plenty
of
both
dark
malty
character
and
ipa
character
nicely
balanced
and
fairly
easy
to
drink
good
beer
not
what
i
expected
in
a
black
ipa
had
a
very
deep
chocolate
color
and
poured
with
a
great
deal
of
head
there
was
too
much
roasted
malted
taste
and
not
enough
hop
for
my
liking
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
ipa
i
was
looking
for
would
recommend
for
a
stout
drinker
appearance
is
very
dark
to
black
as
expected
by
the
desription
on
the
bottle
decent
lacing
and
some
head
is
present
throughout
consumption
a
piney
hop
and
malt
aroma
is
present
upon
lifting
to
your
nose
but
i
would
have
trouble
placing
specific
flavors
via
just
the
smell
taste
reveals
a
very
nicely
balance
beer
with
hops
fading
in
and
out
from
front
to
back
again
piney
but
nice
and
otherwise
indistiguishable
the
dark
malts
bring
chocolate
and
some
mild
smokey
flavors
overall
well
done
and
an
especially
nice
brew
as
we
head
into
fall
o
its
a
pretty
good
nice
mix
of
darker
fruits
and
some
hop
notes
mixed
in
its
a
nicely
done
black
ipa
but
something
is
almost
missing
good
but
not
outstanding
desent
beer
has
depth
of
flavor
and
drinks
well
o
its
an
ok
beer
there
are
a
ton
of
options
on
the
market
for
a
black
ipa
that
i
would
pick
first
but
if
this
was
on
draft
at
a
bar
and
i
was
in
the
mood
i
might
order
a
pint
overall
this
was
a
descent
brew
here
at
the
bar
it
was
the
best
black
ipa
but
it
was
definitely
well
worth
it
i
hope
you
give
it
a
try
it
definitely
satisfied
my
taste
buds
salud
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
or
american
black
ale
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
id
get
it
again
this
is
a
fun
beer
and
to
me
was
highly
drinkable
this
beer
is
a
hot
mess
and
controlled
chaos
at
the
same
time
so
i
suggest
picking
up
a
bomber
and
giving
it
a
go
as
i
really
liked
this
brew
and
recommend
trying
it
originally
reviewed
07182011
plenty
of
bitterness
in
the
taste
still
has
the
roastiness
that
i
dont
prefer
in
a
black
ale
body
is
legitimate
not
a
thin
beer
but
nothing
special
just
really
wanted
more
of
a
discernable
lush
green
hop
flavor
too
much
burnt
malt
flavor
if
you
want
to
make
a
porter
go
ahead
but
call
it
that
already
i
realize
it
isnt
as
sexy
these
days
to
make
a
porter
v
a
black
aleipa
type
of
beer
but
i
dunno
this
rivals
the
best
black
ipa
i
ever
had
pours
real
dark
and
rich
looking
milk
chocolate
color
with
a
shirt
but
lasting
mocha
head
smells
like
coffee
and
deep
dark
english
malt
cocoa
notes
as
well
in
the
nose
flavor
is
heavy
coffee
and
roast
malts
this
is
a
big
beer
with
intense
hops
reaslly
comoing
to
the
fore
later
in
the
flavor
experience
its
bitter
from
chocolate
and
from
hops
in
prolific
tandem
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
butter
with
a
big
body
and
lots
of
nitroesque
carbonation
still
drinkable
enough
to
make
a
bomber
worthwhile
perfect
with
or
without
dinner
or
as
dinner
overall
this
is
friggen
outstanding
one
of
the
better
darlk
india
pales
ive
had
drink
expected
more
but
oh
well
it
was
free
had
some
good
flavors
but
just
kinda
eh
o
although
i
had
my
concerns
about
this
beer
being
over
a
year
old
i
really
enjoyed
it
great
combination
of
citrus
and
roasty
i
will
definitely
seek
out
a
fresh
one
to
see
how
it
compares
still
a
great
beer
in
perhaps
my
favorite
style
overall
a
good
beer
overall
but
the
bitterness
can
be
a
bit
much
at
times
would
be
much
better
if
there
were
more
specialty
malts
to
balance
out
the
bitter
part
of
the
beer
overall
a
very
interesting
and
well
made
beer
o
a
great
beer
and
i
would
love
a
sixer
or
some
more
22s
of
this
def
worth
atry
and
the
price
glad
i
got
to
try
this
but
wont
be
picking
anymore
up
thanks
to
themaniacalone
for
this
beer
definitely
a
beer
id
buy
again
a
pitch
black
brew
with
a
giant
light
oatmeal
colored
head
that
leaves
lots
of
patchy
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
slightly
evergreen
idea
with
hop
bite
blended
smoothly
with
nutty
malt
the
flavor
has
charcoalcitrus
malt
with
grassy
edges
pretty
straight
forward
not
too
complex
but
a
solid
drinkable
black
ipa
this
is
medium
bodied
with
a
frisky
feel
with
fine
carbonation
a
little
more
charcoal
than
i
want
in
any
ipa
but
its
a
pleasant
brew
none
the
less
definitley
tasted
a
little
better
a
bit
more
hoppy
on
tap
not
sure
if
i
can
find
a
beer
that
mates
these
2
tastes
successfully
but
this
beer
was
not
the
soln
for
me
a
bit
too
bitter
too
hoppy
with
an
after
taste
that
really
didnt
appeal
to
me

citrus

too
mouthfeel
is
thin

medium
and
it
lingers
real
good
black
ipa
o
overall
i
was
rather
impressed
i
would
like
to
try
it
fresher
but
at
this
age
it
was
excellent
i
didnt
love
hoppy
feet
1
5
as
i
felt
that
the
hoppiness
was
a
bit
much
on
the
taste
with
all
that
roastiness
perhaps
the
faded
hops
after
a
year
makes
it
more
friendly
to
my
palette
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
have
had
a
few
i
dug
but
the
faded
hops
are
nice
on
this
beer
very
enjoyable
roasty
and
char
charateristics
are
excellent
and
the
subtle
hoppines
is
a
nice
compliment
overall
nice
brew
not
the
best
i
ever
had
but
a
solid
roasted
hoppy
and
smooth
beer
and
worth
a
try
for
sure
the
beer
pours
a
fairly
dark
brown
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
dont
get
a
whole
lot
on
the
nose
just
some
coffee
light
citrus
and
hint
of
eucalyptus
its
attractive
i
just
wish
there
was
more
of
it
the
flavor
profile
replicates
the
nose
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
intermixed
with
the
coffee
and
dry
citrus
the
beer
is
actully
fairly
dry
and
bitter
though
theres
some
initial
sweetness
when
you
take
a
sip
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
fairly
long
and
bitter
finish
with
a
hint
of
licorice
at
the
end
alcohol
is
well
integrated
into
the
flavor
profile
and
while
theres
nothing
extraordinairy
here
its
a
tasty
enough
beer
solid
offering
from
clown
shoes
not
their
best
but
solid
i
prefer
the
hoppy
feet
1
5
over
this
one
1
5
has
more
of
a
hop
presence
and
is
not
as
roasty
dominate
like
this
beer
drinks
fairly
easy
not
the
best
black
ale
out
there
but
worth
your
consideration
o
very
nice
black
ipa
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
blends
nicely
with
the
bitter
grapefruit
and
pine
flavors
if
anything
the
roasted
malt
gets
drowned
out
a
bit
like
a
more
typical
ipadipa
might
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
though
this
batch
is
over
carbonated
i
would
recommend
it
the
body
is
nice
and
full
for
the
style
which
really
allows
the
dark
malt
flavors
to
hit
the
tastebuds
the
carbonation
doesnt
really
present
itself
while
the
beer
is
in
the
mouth
but
does
a
great
job
of
creating
a
smooth
swallow
nicely
balanced
black
ipa
well
crafted
easy
to
appreciate
easy
to
approach
o
this
has
good
drinkability
it
has
good
flavor
and
i
could
easily
have
a
few
pints
of
it
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
meld
quite
well
together
i
recommend
trying
it
out
i
would
drink
it
again
this
is
my
first
clown
shoes
beer
but
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
overall
pretty
interesting
taste
although
not
terribly
intriguing
but
at
the
same
time
not
at
all
dull
slight
differences
between
this
and
the
1
5
i
felt
but
theyre
still
both
pretty
good
selections

more

medium

decently
drinkable
overall
but
can
be
a

if
youre

it

could
have
been

i
really
liked
this
beer
and
i
eagerly
await
more
from
them
tjs
has
a
bunch
of
other
stuff
on
the
upcoming
tap
list
so
ill
be
trying
more
glad
they
arrived

i
kinda
liked

stuff
it
did
not
blow
me
away
but
i
will
look
for
it
again
maybe
o
another
great
black
ipa
from
clown
shoes
i
had
previously
had
the
hoppy
feet
1
5
which
was
also
good
o
decent
beer
from
a
brewery
that
has
earned
my
respect
this
is
for
those
that
would
like
to
have
a
stout
like
beer
without
the
stoutness
o
poured

13
oz
tulip
glass

a
huge
3
inch

that
slowly
settles
into
patch
bubbles
lacing
everywhere
smell
is
chocolate
citrus
and
pine
taste
is
even
more
aggressive
hops
and
dark
chocolate
dominate
the
flavor
body
is
big
for
the
abv
moderate
carbonation
a
little
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
great
beer
and
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
o
overall
a
nice
hoppy
dark
beer
but
not
as
many
aspects
of
an
ipa
as
you
would
expect
tastes
more
like
a
chocolate
stout
to
me
but
i
enjoyed
it
reviewed
from
notes
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
big
tan
head
that
shows
great
retention
and
lace
down
the
glass
i
love
it
already
strong
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
burnt
wood
hoppy
in
the
back
the
taste
has
some
fresh
coffee
beans
roasted
to
the
fullest
earthy
spices
and
huge
hop
finish
that
leaves
the
dragon
o
hop
breath
bitter
in
the
end
creamy
lightly
carbonated
while
flowing
over
the
palate
and
has
very
sharp
bite
in
the
end
first
offering
i
had
from
clown
shoes
and
it
did
not
disappoint
if
only
i
could
of
looked
into
the
future
good
competition
to
stones
ssr
overall
its
a
decent
cascade
dark
so
try
it
but
certainly
not
near
the
top
in
the
style
lacks
complexity
just
not
as
flavorful
as
others
o
this
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
has
lots
of
hops
but
isnt
overly
bitter
o
solid
black
ipa
not
on
the
level
with
others
ive
had
such
as
southern
tier
or
stone
but
good
nonetheless
the
fact
that
i
had
hoppy
feet
1
5
before
the
original
might
have
given
me
a
weird
perspective
i
really
think
this
could
benefit
from
a
little
more
body
im
not
in
love
with
the
hop
profile
but
its
good
for
what
it
is
this
is
an
alright
black
ipa
but
i
prefer
the
1
5
version
that
they
put
out
the
difference
is
the
malt
character
and
the
body
in
the
amped
up
1
5
version
the
body
is
fuller
and
the
malt
character
is
far
richer
and
smoother
this
is
still
a
good
beer
just
thin
and
not
as
bold
o
the
bad
news
is
that
i
didnt
go
for
this
beer
like
i
had
hoped
i
would
i
love
a
hoppy
beer
but
this
is
overdone
for
overdones
sake
the
good
news
is
that
i
can
handle
drinking
beer
again
yay
more
reviews
to
come
thanks
for
reading
from
a
bomber
bought
in
somerville
had
straight
from
the
bomber
no
time
for
pouring
into
a
glass
i
can
still
tell
it
has
quite
a
nice
foam
head
and
a
very
dark
color
precise
analysis
of
shades
and
tints
unnecessary
whiff
of
both
hops
and
malts
exactly
what
you
want
in
a
black
ipa
same
goes
for
taste
both
a
nice
malt
flavor
not
too
choclatey
closer
to
nutty
and
the
hops
leave
a
citrus
note
and
are
not
over
powering
not
overpowering
on
either
stout
or
ipa
qualities
id
say
almost
a
5050
blend
of
a
standard
nutty
stout
and
a
citrusy
ipa
it
works
well
this
is
a
great
black
ipa
regularly
available
and
is
of
high
quality
if
you
are
into
black
ipas
this
is
one
you
can
put
in
the
books
as
one
you
can
rely
on
after
trying
the
first
bottle
of
hoppy
feet
i
tried
a
second
one
provided
by
the
good
people
of
mercury
brwing
and
it
was
much
better
the
color
was
an
opaque
rich
with
offwhite
head
that
laced
the
aroma
was
roast
and
with
slight
bitter
citrus
the
taste
was
a
good
roasty
malt
which
a
bitter
grapefruit
that
provides
the
nice
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
with
good
carbontaion
overall
it
is
not
the
best
black
ipa
i
ever
had
but
it
was
definitely
decent
and
worth
a
taste
aroma
is
smoky
and
hoppy
and
i
like
both
it
has
an
undertone
of
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
freshcut
wood
enough
to
get
me
drooling
it
pours
a
luscious
dark
chocolate
brown
with
a
fluffy
and
rather
persistent
light
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
leaves
some
good
lacing
flavor
is
hoppy
and
bitter
with
a
hint
of
evergreen
and
a
mocha
undertone
and
a
touch
of
licorice
fullbodied
texture
is
smooth
yet
edgy
and
quite
fizzy
leaving
a
hoppy
and
chocolaty
finish
hoppy
feet
will
give
you
a
happy
mouth
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
though
there
are
better
examples
of
american
black
ales
i
must
say
with
the
black
ipa
increasing
in
popularity
this
is
one
of
the
finer
examples
of
the
style
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
now
on
to
hoppy
feet
1
5
a
bomber
of
hoppy
feet
is
before
me
the
beer
pours
essentially
black
with
a
big
rocky
cap
of
foam
above
it
it
is
really
a
nice
looking
beverage
the
aroma
combines
grapefruit
and
pine
into
a
nice
blend
the
malt
contributes
hints
of
chocolate
which
strengthen
as
the
beer
warms
a
solid
creamy
body
propels
all
the
flavor
all
the
way
through
a
heavy
hand
of
bitter
and
pine
hops
is
counteracted
by
a
cocoa
powderlike
backbone
which
leaves
the
palate
dry
a
tinge
of
alcohol
warmth
signals
the
end
of
the
experience
i
really
enjoy
the
interplay
between
the
dark
malt
and
hops
in
this
beer
bringing
the
beer
a
pleasing
amount
of
depth
picked
up
a
bottle
on
a
trip
to
boston
this
was
my
first
beer
ive
had
from
this
brewery
the
beer
was
bottled
on
92011
it
poured
a
very
dark
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
was
grassy
and
dry
almost
resembled
a
dry
sponge
the
taste
was
of
overwhelmingly
vegetal
hop
flavors
without
much
of
a
malt
presence
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
were
appropriate
for
this
style
normally
i
love
this
style
and
i
love
hoppy
beers
but
the
grassy
hop
flavors
made
it
very
difficult
for
me
to
finish
the
glass
pours
a
dark
black
with
no
light
thru
with
a
two
finger
head
smells
piney
earthy
hops
licorice
and
a
sweet
maltiness
taste
of
licorice
carmel
malts
bitter
coffee
and
a
nice
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
i
like
the
style
very
much
the
hops
are
not
as
cirtus
as
the
west
coast
its
a
different
flavor
of
hops
and
malts
form
other
black
ipas
ive
tried
very
interesting
brew
clown
shoes
hoppy
feet
is
a
solid
black
ale
with
a
huge
lumpy
tan
head
that
stays
put
and
leaves
outstanding
lacing
it
turns
into
a
ceramic
nitrogenlooking
head
ive
never
seen
a
head
like
that
from
a
bottle
it
has
an
aroma
of
sweet
malt
grass
flowers
and
a
soft
roastiness
its
full
bodied
super
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
clean
dry
finish
the
flavor
is
a
perfect
balance
between
soft
roastiness
and
a
botanical
bitterness
theres
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
that
is
erased
in
the
bitter
finish
the
aftertaste
is
kind
of
ashy
wow
i
could
drink
a
bathtub
full
of
this
these
clown
shoes
guys
are
really
on
the
ball
o
a
nice
eastcoast
american
black
ale
or
ipa
the
classification
name
of
the
style
doesnt
matter
when
the
flavor
and
craft
are
this
good
the
7
abv
hoppy
feet
manages
to
balance
porterlike
complexity
and
sweetness
with
dry
spicy
and
wideranging
hop
varietals
in
the
tradition
of
many
new
england
style
ipas
pretty
good
brew
not
overly
complex
and
id
like
to
see
the
hops
shine
through
a
touch
more
but
still
very
drinkable
o
pretty
disappointed
more
tolerable
than
the
1
5
but
stones
black
ipa
is
still
my
favorite
for
this
style
o
way
to
go
clown
shoes
youve
melded
two
worlds
together
in
one
memorable
brew
overall
a
delicious
brew
very
bitter
brew
and
perhaps
a
bit
too
maltforward
for
my
liking
but
this
is
one
that
belongs
toward
the
top
of
its
class
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
red
highlights
and
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
piney
hops
as
well
as
a
good
dose
of
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
i
get
a
lot
of
bitter
chocolate
and
burnt
malt
notes
with
some
pine
from
the
hops
also
mixed
in
the
bitterness
is
fairly
low
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
bold
and
roasty
black
ale
thats
for
true
good
representation
of
the
style
the
accidental
highway
to
hell
tour
continues
this
stop
pours
a
dark
garnettinged
blackbrown
topped
by
a
finger
of
dusty
tan
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
chocolate
light
roasted
malts
dry
pine
needles
and
very
light
sand
honestly
what
my
brain
associates
with
this
smell
is
sand
the
taste
holds
notes
of
coffee
darkly
roasted
malts
light
leather
light
char
sharp
pine
resin
and
lime
skin
things
come
off
decidedly
bitter
and
acrid
to
the
point
that
my
face
evinces
my
bodys
inner
wincing
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
feel
overall
what
seems
like
a
good
beer
decides
to
go
all
mr
hyde
on
my
tongue
ruining
everything
im
not
sure
what
happened
but
its
just
too
darkly
bitter
and
astringent
for
my
liking
big
fluffy
and
airy
tan
head
dissipates
slightly
then
pretty
much
chills
in
place
with
one
finger
of
froth
on
top
and
thick
swath
of
lace
left
clinging
black
with
thin
crimson
edges
at
the
light
smells
of
malts
some
melon
herbal
hops
and
distant
notes
of
mint
tastes
a
bit
grainy
and
sweet
with
more
melon
goodness
quite
subdued
distant
black
licorice
sweetness
and
oily
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
thinner
than
expected
but
not
to
the
point
of
weakness
dry
slightly
rough
going
down
but
drinkability
does
not
suffer
i
dont
notice
even
a
hint
of
alcohol
heat
not
the
best
aba
ive
had
but
a
damn
fine
example
that
i
would
revisit
often
if
it
were
available
here
overall
a
very
hoppy
black
ipa
that
hits
the
spot
a
slow
sipping
beer
the
bomber
will
last
you
nicely
in
a
session
d
nice
overall
strange
but
it
works
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
like
it
that
a
lot
of
new
breweries
are
making
the
black
ipa
styles
this
one
is
a
little
enthusiastic
in
the
bittering
hop
department
so
that
it
makes
it
end
a
bit
harsh
when
mixed
with
the
dark
malts
and
carbonation
i
would
like
this
beer
to
replace
a
bit
of
the
dark
malts
with
more
chocolate
to
soften
the
malt
profile
up
a
bit
and
if
it
was
still
necessary
use
a
few
less
ibus
this
is
at
least
my
fourth
time
drinking
this
beer
so
i
apparently
dont
have
too
many
issues
with
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
have
recently
come
to
love
this
style
and
this
is
not
on
top
of
the
list
of
the
ones
i
love
but
is
high
on
the
list
great
to
see
this
one
distributed
to
arizona
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
nice
head
and
lacing
dark
but
not
opaque
pine
aroma
mixed
with
alchohol
and
roasted
malt
taste
is
hoppy
pine
and
citrus
nicely
balanced
by
the
dark
malt
backbone
really
crave
the
dry
bitter
mouthfeel
its
tough
to
sip
this
beer
this
is
a
style
im
really
becoming
fond
of
and
this
is
a
nice
blend
of
hoppy
ipa
and
darkly
roasted
malt
o
a
nice
black
ipa
will
enjoy
again
cheers
overall
it
was
too
bitter
without
any
balance
to
it
for
me
if
you
like
the
very
bitter
ones
then
this
is
for
you
if
not
id
not
recommend
just
entered
the
tx
market
welcome
rotation
excited
to
try
some
of
their
other
beers
already
like
the
clementine
but
one
of
this
one
is
enough
for
me
for
now
might
try
again
done
the
road
as
my
bitter
palate
develops
nnbl
d
a
black
ipa
with
a
simple
charm
that
i
enjoy
quite
a
bit
pick
it
up
if
you
enjoy
imperial
stouts
or
maltforward
black
ipas
definitely
will
revisit
o
easily
the
best
black
ale
ive
had
so
glad
to
try
this
beer
and
im
getting
a
bottle
as
we
speak
very
tasty
very
pleasant
this
is
one
of
the
smoother
examples
of
a
black
ipa
that
ive
had
the
nose
opens
as
it
warms
with
more
a
more
floral
aroma
than
it
had
at
the
start
a
quality
brew
try
one
if
you
can
o
a
very
enjoyable
black
ipa
mouthfeel
quite
smooth
and
mellow
with
the
roasted
aftertaste
but
the
sticky
nice
bitter
taste
lingerers
for
awhile
the
roasted
flavor
covers
the
7
and
creates
an
easy
drinking
experience
i
will
buy
another
bottle
and
i
am
interested
to
see
how
this
compares
to
there
1
5
hoppy
feet
of
the
clown
shoes
i
tried
i
liked
this
one
the
least
but
wont
hold
it
against
them
im
not
a
hophead
after
all
overall
i
would
have
preferred
a
few
more
dimensions
to
this
beer
it
seemed
like
it
was
all
chocolate
and
dark
malts
would
have
loved
a
bigger
malt
profile
to
balance
it
out
hop
in
the
dark
and
sublimely
are
better
choices
imo
drinkability
fairly
drinkable
black
ipa
this
is
a
mediumbodied
beer
but
i
do
have
to
say
id
prefer
it
to
be
a
bit
more
fullbodied
not
that
its
watery
though
it
is
however
very
drinkable
smooth
and
creamy
throughout
taste
shows
off
the
brighter
lighter
and
hop
flavor
side
of
this
newfound
style
crisp
and
refreshing
it
is
quite
drinkable
the
hops
are
bitter
but
back
off
a
bit
on
the
end
and
dont
combine
with
heavily
roasty
astringent
malt
to
make
the
finish
ashy
and
tonguescraping
i
dont
want
to
say
the
malts
are
more
in
the
background
than
most
of
the
style
but
the
hops
seem
more
vibrant
and
have
a
sharper
flavor
doesnt
seem
to
have
quite
the
complexity
of
a
ssr
but
its
a
damn
fine
brew
one
of
the
better
bipas
fo
sho
the
nose
was
definitely
suggesting
more
of
a
malthop
balance
which
was
kind
of
disappointing
because
damn
it
smelled
great
a
brew
i
certainly
suggest
especially
to
hop
heads
the
body
is
definitely
more
stout
than
ipa
i
kind
of
prefer
it
the
other
way
around
the
profile
comes
initially
with
a
roasty
flavor
mixed
with
citrus
maybe
orange
the
fruitiness
dies
down
and
blends
into
a
hoppy
bitterness
that
becomes
a
stale
coffee
that
leaves
lingering
roasted
and
raw
hop
flavors
it
has
nice
transitions
and
is
well
layered
but
im
not
completely
satisfied
it
misses
the
raw
bold
hoppiness
of
stones
ssr
and
its
not
as
well
rounded
or
clean
as
the
sn
stout
this
lies
somewhere
between
the
two
but
i
do
wish
it
would
pick
more
of
a
side
ideally
more
towards
the
rough
and
tumble
ssr
this
is
a
good
beer
but
it
could
be
more
assertive
on
one
of
two
lines
either
of
which
would
make
it
a
more
impressive
drink
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
brew
if
you
like
bitter
dark
chocolate
this
brew
is
for
you
my
only
complaint
is
the
nose
does
not
translate
to
the
flavor
from
an
abundance
of
bitterness
very
good
beer
but
had
almost
too
much
coffee
at
the
end
pours
a
very
nice
blackish
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
which
leaves
some
nice
sticky
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
roasted
malts
hops
caramel
chocolate
the
taste
is
malty
with
some
nice
roasted
notes
nice
little
hop
note
slight
licorice
medium
body
with
a
nice
drybitter
finish
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
glad
to
have
had
a
chance
to
try
it
o
this
beer
was
very
good
i
think
personally
i
really
liked
it
it
lacked
a
little
bit
in
the
flavor
profile
but
in
the
in
i
would
defiantly
try
more
beers
from
this
brewery
the
mouthfeel
feels
a
little
bit
thin
and
overcarbonated
but
its
not
overly
distracting
the
drinkability
is
fairly
good
overall
im
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
beer
its
a
good
beer
that
looks
and
smells
phenomenal
id
give
it
a
shot
for
sure
but
i
wasnt
blown
away
i
guess
thats
what
having
a
great
nose
that
isnt
quite
echoed
by
the
taste
will
do
though
dont
get
me
wrong
i
liked
this
beer
however
its
just
so
close
to
greatness
that
it
hurts
big
shout
to
charliedvrs
glad
to
have
tried
and
a
want
of
mine
all
indications
were
that
this
was
going
to
be
great
but
the
taste
just
does
not
live
up
to
the
small
look
and
feel
of
the
beer
od
a
quality
black
ipa
the
more
popular
this
style
has
become
the
less
ive
actually
enjoyed
trying
different
versions
of
it
the
novelty
has
definately
worn
off
that
said
i
still
liked
this
for
its
complexity
and
balance
drinks
like
a
hopped
to
hell
stout
good
o
very
solid
black
ipa
like
the
hoppy
feet
1
5
a
lot
more
but
this
is
a
decent
substitute
do
despite
the
aggressive
columbus
hop
presence
here
this
is
a
remarkable
black
ipa
i
didnt
want
to
like
this
beer
from
a
poorlynamed
brewery
that
seemed
overhyped
since
the
first
mention
of
it
now
this
beer
has
convinced
me
that
clown
shoes
is
only
a
slightly
worse
name
for
a
brewery
than
the
bruery
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
not
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
o
too
much
roasted
malt
without
enough
hop
flavor
or
aroma
to
it
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
my
pick
of
the
litter
of
the
clown
shoes
that
have
made
it
to
texas
i
would
put
this
into
the
american
stout
category
myself
as
it
doesnt
come
with
the
hops
i
expect
of
an
ipa
black
or
otherwise
its
the
first
clown
shoes
i
could
see
getting
another
bottle
of
o
it
was
ok
not
great
not
bad
just
an
ok
beer
wouldnt
give
another
go
i
think
didnt
have
any
substantial
differentiating
factor
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
clown
shoes
bit
of
a
let
down
maybe
eagle
claw
fist
will
change
my
mind
oi
really
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
better
ive
had
in
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
and
is
highly
recommended
especially
if
you
are
a
hophead
oi
love
ipas
but
so
far
black
ipas
have
not
been
that
good
for
me
i
think
it
has
too
much
porterquality
for
me
this
was
a
very
strong
hopped
beer
though
a
tasty
beer
that
settles
on
the
line
where
drier
american
porters
meet
ipas
but
with
that
plasticlike
roasty
astringent
mix
late
it
just
cant
earn
higher
marks
i
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
the
pour
is
jet
black
big
white
rock
hard
head
the
lacing
is
impressive
the
aroma
is
sweet
pine
grapefruit
the
beer
has
bitter
pine
grapefruit
lots
of
dark
malt
notes
the
body
is
medium
full
of
carbonation
thick
mouthfeel
i
liked
this
one
a
tasty
black
ipa
besides
the
ever
lasting
head
this
was
pretty
good
dark
toasted
bread
backbone
some
chocolate
and
molasses
but
the
hops
dominate
here
pine
and
earthy
some
zesty
spice
but
mostly
the
robust
hops
bitter
yeups
nice
it
sorta
depends
on
what
youre
thinking
about
that
determines
which
flavors
come
out
more
malt
some
smoke
chocolate
pine
raisin
leather
andor
zest
me
like
the
taste
has
an
iron
flavor
along
with
some
light
astringency
there
is
a
light
hop
bite
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
rich
but
its
just
not
an
impressive
beer
certainly
smells
like
no
expense
was
spared
on
hops
some
background
roast
but
the
chief
aromas
are
pine
grapefruit
orange
lemon
zest
and
mint
intensely
hoppy
if
you
want
your
palate
whooped
look
no
further
scathing
bitterness
is
enhanced
by
a
sticky
drying
finish
grapefruit
has
pushed
aside
the
gentler
citrus
just
a
touch
of
devils
food
cake
sweetness
a
minor
complaint
is
that
the
roast
is
almost
entirely
overpowered
by
the
hops
but
major
props
to
clown
shoes
for
this
brew
a
rare
east
coast
hop
bomb
pours
black
tan
head
nice
sexy
body
with
nothing
clumsy
about
it
nose
is
quite
nice
with
dark
roasted
coffee
dark
chocolate
and
some
minty
pine
wonder
if
caribou
coffee
makes
a
latte
like
this
anyway
on
the
palate
this
beer
offers
bitterness
up
front
right
away
more
pine
and
then
the
coffee
character
immediately
casts
its
shadow
over
the
entire
tasting
experience
finish
is
bitter
chocolatey
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
the
flavors
meld
pretty
well
and
finishes
with
quite
bitter
i
really
like
this
overall
a
nice
blend
of
the
black
flavors
and
the
hop
flavors
to
many
beers
of
this
style
tend
to
be
underwhelming
on
the
black
and
smokey
flavors
and
be
to
hop
dominant
not
this
one
a
great
balance
of
both
thats
an
incredibly
complex
beer
with
huge
flavor
but
one
that
is
remarkably
balanced
what
a
beer
easy
to
drink
and
pleasing
for
hopheads
and
malt
lovers
alike
o
i
could
drink
this
alot
if
only
it
was
available
in
michigan
overall
for
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
seems
to
me
that
the
hops
are
too
high
profile
and
cirtrusy
and
that
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
for
this
beer
the
hops
arent
detracting
from
the
brew
at
all
the
strong
northwest
hops
are
what
the
style
is
all
about
theres
a
reason
it
was
referred
to
as
cascadian
dark
ale
at
one
time
for
the
hops
coming
from
the
cascade
mountain
range
area
in
the
nw
theyre
just
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
in
this
beer
or
maybe
the
roast
and
dark
malt
isnt
strong
enough
the
carbonation
though
is
what
does
detract
for
the
beer
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
like
ive
said
i
just
wish
the
carbonation
wasnt
so
damn
high
clown
shoes
brings
it
again
a
solid
hoppy
black
ale
good
blendof
the
dark
malt
and
the
fruity
hops
overall
a
solid
black
ale
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
definatly
worth
a
try
and
im
looking
forward
to
hoppy
feet
1
5
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
when
i
had
heard
about
it
i
was
unaware
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
black
ipa
the
brew
has
a
very
nice
dark
brownish
black
color
with
a
pretty
nice
looking
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
big
hop
aroma
on
the
nose
which
i
found
to
be
very
nice
there
is
also
some
hints
of
chocolate
in
there
as
well
the
taste
had
some
lemony
citrus
to
it
along
with
a
bitter
dry
aftertaste
of
chocolatey
flavors
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
was
quite
good
i
would
enjoy
having
it
again
one
day
overall
interesting
but
too
much
smoke
for
me
flavors
are
very
nice
and
really
well
balanced
semi
sweet
bakers
chocolate
really
takes
the
stage
and
shows
itself
nicely
roasty
with
spent
coffee
grounds
abound
some
citrusy
hops
are
taken
by
earthy
pine
riddled
goodness
on
the
finish
a
bit
grassy
with
some
anise
qualities
deep
in
the
finish
burnt
caramel
orange
grilled
pineapple
and
even
some
apricot
flavors
nice
and
easy
on
the
palate
overall
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
very
enjoyable
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
in
the
future
for
sure
medium
body
good
carbonation
alcohol
is
well
hidden
pretty
nice
even
though
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
o
overall
this
is
my
second
clown
shoes
beer
i
had
tramp
stamp
last
night
and
really
enjoyed
it
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
as
well
conclusion
i
really
wish
i
could
like
this
beer
more
however
it
reminds
me
of
a
overhopped
strong
stout
i
brewed
a
while
back
and
that
beer
was
sort
of
a
black
mark
on
my
homebrewing
track
record
the
mixture
of
darkly
roasted
malts
with
hops
is
interesting
and
no
doubt
tasty
to
some
but
it
doesnt
ring
my
bell
overall
this
is
a
damn
solid
beer
flavorful
and
smooth
not
an
upperechelon
brew
but
one
i
definitely
see
myself
returning
to
pours
a
very
deep
brown
just
about
black
and
almost
completely
opaque
thick
fluffy
tan
head
that
lasts
indefinitely
resinous
hop
aroma
spicy
pine
and
strong
grapefruit
notes
and
a
touch
of
roast
malt
underneath
the
hops
are
much
more
subtle
in
the
flavor
mostly
roast
malt
but
with
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
and
just
a
little
grapefruit
mouthfeel
comes
on
strong
and
thick
but
the
beer
quickly
seems
to
get
more
watery
or
thinner
with
more
carbonation
pours
black
with
very
little
head
what
there
is
is
white
and
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smells
earthy
and
citrusy
with
some
pine
and
firm
malt
very
dry
but
also
very
little
roastiness
thats
fine
by
me
id
rather
this
be
a
black
ale
than
a
mischaracterised
porter
the
taste
is
very
very
dry
almost
none
of
the
malt
shows
through
very
attenuated
with
almost
beefy
flavors
and
a
bitterness
that
approaches
that
of
an
amaro
pine
and
earth
notes
along
with
some
gentian
tastes
here
very
dry
in
the
mouth
almost
austere
an
interesting
beer
and
a
bit
different
than
others
ive
had
in
the
style
wouldnt
be
confused
with
a
porter
but
also
not
with
a
juicy
ipa
nice

d
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
this
one
after
having
the
1
5
version
which
was
the
only
black
ipa
that
i
can
say
ive
loved
at
a
tasting
this
is
more
along
the
lines
of
a
typical
black
ipa
where
nothing
works
well
with
anything
else
overall
i
really
really
like
this
beer
very
different
type
of
beer
and
wish
i
could
get
this
around
here
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
was
at
the
salem
harvest
fest
not
only
were
the
brewers
witty
and
and
energetic
they
produced
a
great
ipa
with
bold
nutty
chocolate
flavor
and
great
emphasis
on
hop
bitterness
making
it
a
really
great
beer
that
i
associate
with
all
the
sights
and
smells
of
autumn
o
i
liked
it
nothing
too
special
here
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
it
its
just
not
memorable
o
a
very
nice
version
of
an
ipa
that
focuses
more
on
the
darker
side
of
the
scale
as
opposed
to
the
typical
light
citrus
strongly
bitter
side
most
ipas
live
in
seems
like
it
could
be
a
great
beer
to
have
in
the
late
fall
when
you
are
really
trying
to
hold
on
to
summer
beers
summer
style
colder
month
taste
the
cpj
pours
a
chalky
dark
charcoal
black
with
moderate
cap
of
grayish
head
light
rings
of
sticky
lacing
scent
is
a
blend
of
piney
and
grapefruity
hops
backed
by
a
light
roast
and
char
grain
profile
taste
more
focused
than
scent
as
a
lot
of
fruit
and
pine
comes
through
bitter
hops
and
bitter
roast
work
nicely
light
sweetness
and
faint
hints
of
chocolate
minerals
and
burnt
grain
medium
bodied
dry
on
palate
a
decent
black
ipa
with
a
touch
more
roast
and
char
and
lacking
some
sweetness
overall
the
drink
more
like
a
stout
than
a
black
ipa
but
the
taste
is
still
very
good
i
saw
another
reviewer
compare
it
to
a
storm
king
and
i
agree
with
that
im
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
beers
that
i
bought
from
this
brewer
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
bitter
dry
hop
presnce
up
front
with
hints
of
floral
hops
and
earthy
pine
underneath
there
is
a
prominent
roasted
malt
character
with
hints
of
burnt
toast
coffee
bean
dark
chocolate
and
oatmealal
slightly
acrid
but
not
overly
bitter
faint
sweetness
and
subtle
lactic
cream
but
overall
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
compliments
the
roasted
malt
a
bit
bitter
dry
and
earthy
but
not
from
the
hops
too
malty
to
be
an
ipa
and
not
enough
complexity
to
be
a
hoppy
dark
beer
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
that
focused
more
on
the
hops
with
the
malt
being
at
a
minimum
the
finish
was
very
nice
with
this
beer
i
would
love
to
try
some
more
from
these
new
guys
o
im
quite
surprised
with
this
one
this
tastes
almost
identical
to
a
stout
but
a
powerfully
hopped
stout
even
so
the
hops
and
coffeedouble
espresso
notes
mix
well
and
make
a
fine
ale
good
beer
here
this
is
quite
the
beer
it
really
embraces
the
black
ipa
or
american
black
ale
or
whatever
style
the
roasted
malt
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
this
beer
as
the
hops
it
could
almost
pass
for
a
hoppy
stout
in
fact
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
storm
king
whatever
the
case
this
is
a
very
good
beer
recommended
black
as
night
with
a
light
colored
head
that
rose
up
about
an
inch
and
a
half
before
settling
down
into
a
nice
broken
crown
that
stayed
throughout
the
session
the
aroma
was
very
bright
lots
of
citrus
here
orange
and
tangerine
mostly
and
a
wonderfully
bright
lemon
like
aroma
that
rose
up
not
at
all
what
you
would
have
expected
from
something
that
looked
so
fark
nice
medium
body
with
a
smooth
and
mellow
carbonation
and
a
lightness
to
it
that
again
was
outside
what
i
was
expecting
smooth
flavor
clean
crisp
loaded
with
bitter
citrus
hops
lots
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
here
such
a
tight
and
very
hoppy
big
ipa
i
was
very
pleased
with
this
one
for
sure
big
thanks
goes
out
to
a
coworker
who
brought
this
back
for
me
after
a
business
trip
bottled
in
the
middle
of
april
2011
served
from
bottle
into
a
mikkeller
oversized
wine
glass
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
three
finger
light
tan
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
earth
and
bitter
hops
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
citrus
citrus
hop
and
dark
chocolate
it
had
a
heavy
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
brew
wasnt
too
bad
it
was
very
forward
on
the
roastiness
and
dark
chocolate
flavors
almost
too
much
so
they
kind
of
stole
the
show
over
the
hops
if
one
can
believe
such
a
thing
it
was
still
however
quite
easy
to
drink
despite
this
fact
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
finally
o
was
really
expecting
to
have
a
good
cda
that
had
the
roasted
malts
present
to
separate
it
from
a
regular
ipa
but
it
wasnt
here
also
hop
selection
wasnt
able
to
balance
this
one
out
as
it
had
sweetness
on
the
taste
but
ended
very
finished
bitter
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
better
blend
overall
its
a
good
beer
cant
wait
to
start
seeing
this
in
nj
and
to
try
the
1
5
soon
o
very
well
done
for
blackcascadianwhatever
dark
ipa
haters
out
there
try
this
one
youll
become
seduced
by
the
dark
side
for
sure
taste
is
roasted
malt
at
the
forefront
follows
up
with
a
burnt
char
type
taste
which
adds
some
some
coffeelike
bitterness
a
light
pine
hop
flavor
melds
in
the
aftertaste
the
roasted
aspects
definitely
dominate
this
aba
but
because
of
that
it
lends
a
thicker
than
usual
creaminess
for
the
style
the
palate
is
well
carbonated
with
a
little
oily
texture
interetsing
beer
for
the
dark
hopheads
out
there
d
this
is
how
i
like
my
black
ales
tasty
o
even
if
you
dont
like
this
style
ill
urge
you
to
give
this
one
a
try
another
nice
brew
from
clown
shoes
o
this
one
has
elements
of
a
great
black
ipa
but
the
complexities
and
nuances
seem
overwhelmed
by
the
extreme
bitterness
i
dont
think
i
will
reach
for
another
as
the
bitterness
tended
to
grate
on
me
from
the
very
beginning
looks
black
but
not
opaque
the
color
shinning
through
is
a
beautiful
cherry
light
brown
head
started
strong
but
is
now
having
some
trouble
holding
in
the
glass
smells
good
floral
hop
smell
i
feel
like
i
can
smell
the
bitterness
taste
is
quite
bitter
and
surprisingly
roasty
in
flavor
very
porteresk
i
always
think
ibas
just
taste
like
very
bitterhoppy
porters
and
get
way
better
after
aging
trying
to
tame
the
bitterness
and
flavor
hops
down
and
bring
out
the
maltiness
after
reading
the
abv
of
the
beer
i
can
see
why
the
flavors
were
so
intense
interesting
beer
could
use
some
adjustment
for
the
sake
of
balance
in
my
opinion
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
it
does
a
nice
job
of
straddling
the
fine
line
between
dipa
with
dark
malts
and
a
hoppy
porterstout
well
worth
a
shot
hoppy

is
a
pretty
solid

a
solid
black
ipa
and
worth
having
again
more
chocolate
taste
than
hops
but
it
works
well
its
ashy
bitter
roast
is
distinctive
this
is
a
black
ipa
for
lovers
of
hoppy
stout
porters
ostrikingly
bitter
after
a
while
but
good
nonetheless
roasted
malts
and
piny
hop
bitterness
up
front
coffee
light
molasses
and
a
little
smoke
sneak
in
before
big
hop
bitterness
steals
the
show
piny
resinous
herbal
and
even
a
little
aspirin
in
there
finish
stays
bitter
with
lingering
caramel
and
roasted
coffee
flavors
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
very
nicely
done
the
finish
is
equally
harsh
enough
said
d
this
looked
and
smelled
great
but
the
flavor
just
wasnt
that
enjoyable
and
the
body
was
only
ok
the
harsh
finish
made
it
a
bit
tough
to
drink
recommended
to
smell
only
on
tap
at
tommy
doyles
big
foamy
head
tan
lace
was
nice
the
smell
floored
me
grapefruit
assault
pine
hops
in
abundance
also
peat
smoke
or
roast
dark
chocolate
complex
the
taste
was
similar
but
more
bitter
than
expected
really
bitter
with
a
long
after
taste
that
i
liked
agressive
stuff
enjoyed
this
one
reccomend
im
not
happy
with
this
black
ale
its
a
porter
with
hop
astringency
instead
of
roasted
malt
the
hop
flavor
is
lacking
i
could
have
just
got
a
hopped
up
porter
like
troegs
dead
reckoning
instead
that
at
least
has
malt
layers
and
hop
flavor
good
hoppy
black
beer
good
hops
amarillo
gives
it
orange
taste
its
a
little
strange
with
the
malted
chocolate
malts
drinkable
but
not
as
integrated
as
you
would
think
dark
black
a
little
retained
head
nutty
altogether
good
beer
not
not
outstanding
as
the
1
5
hoppy
aromas
to
make
a
long
story
short
hoppy
feet
has
the
minty
piny
citrusy
hoppiness
of
an
american
ipa
and
all
the
bold
roasty
bittersweet
chocolaty
flavours
of
an
american
porter
and
is
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
come
across
its
character
and
quality
are
both
telling
about
the
mentality
of
this
new
upandcoming
brewery
recommended
pours
a
black
body
with
strong
head
that
leaves
lace
down
glass
a
roasted
malt
smell
is
what
i
pick
up
first
along
w
a
bready
dryness
and
a
minor
bitterfloral
hop
presence
smooth
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
has
a
malty
edge
that
contains
some
sweetness
but
also
a
dry
taste
that
is
pleasant
balances
with
citricfloral
hops
so
the
hops
are
noticeable
as
well
finishes
dry
and
crisp
and
well
not
going
to
set
world
on
fire
with
flavor
profile
it
is
wellcraftedbalanced
and
a
pleasure
to
sip
on
all
said
n
done
i
think
it
is
worth
your
time
and
effort
to
sample
this
beer
o
ok
started
strong
with
the
looks
and
the
nose
but
falls
apart
a
bit
thereafter
o
this
brew
not
offensive
in
any
way
but
i
felt
that
it
should
offer
more
black
ipa
is
a
new
style
and
ive
only
had
a
few
the
taste
notes
are
all
good
to
my
palate
it
blends
a
good
roastiness
will
a
couple
of
levels
of
chocolate
and
a
good
quality
hops
but
what
stops
me
from
really
liking
this
brew
is
overall
impression
that
its
a
little
thin
i
will
try
this
again
d
i
dont
know
if
im
used
to
this
style
wellenough
to
make
a
fair
judgment
its
good
but
im
not
familiar
enough
with
black
ipas
i
would
like
to
try
a
different
type
of
hop
whether
it
is
centennial
or
not
for
this
brew
give
it
a
go
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
super
drinkable
for
a
black
ipa
as
the
chewy
bitterness
is
pretty
persistent
but
its
actually
very
nice
overall
back
to
the
beer
hoppy
feet
may
not
be
my
goto
clown
shoes
brew
but
damn
its
a
tasty
one
a
bit
different
then
i
was
expecting
yet
still
highly
drinkable
i
am
continually
impressed
by
their
suds
and
am
thrilled
i
can
finally
find
them
in
northern
virginia
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
and
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
i
have
had
i
have
previously
had
the
1
5
hoppy
feet
and
that
was
excellent
this
is
also
very
good
its
quite
bitter
so
its
not
super
drinkable
but
i
am
very
much
enjoying
this
bomber
another
impressive
beer
from
clown
shoes
to
my
mind
this
is
the
embodiment
of
a
black
ipa
kind
of
the
best
of
both
worlds
in
short
clown
shoes
black
ipa
is
big
and
wellbalanced
hoppy
beer
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
by
itself
and
with
food
its
really
outstanding
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
love
that
its
creamy
and
smooth
like
a
stout
but
finishes
like
an
ipa
i
wish
i
had
tried
this
beer
sooner
if
you
like
stout
for
its
creaminess
and
ipas
for
their
potency
and
bitterness
this
is
the
best
of
both
words
buy
this
if
you
see
it
cheers
prost
overall
more
debittered
roasted
malts
please
to
much
roasted
bitterness
spoils
what
would
otherwise
be
an
excellent
black
ipa
by
the
bottom
of
the
bomber
its
grown
on
my
some
so
ive
bumped
some
scores
a
little
d
hoppy
brew
that
dances
around
the
palate
as
a
roasty
brew
a
great
first
impression
d
just
another
average
bipa
nothing
overwhelming
but
it
isnt
too
bad
could
use
a
bit
less
smoke
but
not
too
hard
to
drink
worth
repeat
visits
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
to
almost
black
color
with
a
decent
tan
head
the
smell
is
hoppy
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
character
to
it
the
taste
is
hoppy
biiterness
and
roasted
malt
bitterness
balanced
well
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
overal
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
still
trying
to
find
my
way
through
this
style
of
beer
this
a
solid
beer
but
like
many
of
the
beers
in
this
style
that
i
have
tried
it
comes
off
as
more
of
a
hoppy
porter
worth
a
try
for
sure
flavor
is
hoppy
up
front
with
a
dark
chocolate
presence
and
again
im
reminded
of
tasting
homebrewed
wort
with
respect
to
sweetness
the
finish
however
is
highly
astringent
with
flavors
of
both
hop
bitterness
and
malt
husks
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
with
a
mediumlight
body
but
the
bitter
finish
is
a
bit
too
much
to
stomach
and
i
normally
love
this
style
d
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
brew
one
of
the
bipas
that
i
have
enjoyed
but
with
my
homebrew
version
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
roasteddark
malt
character
d
a
decent
beer
but
not
what
i
would
think
of
for
a
black
ipa
tastes
like
a
thin
stout
or
porter
though
it
drinks
just
fine
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
until
i
pass
out
this
is
such
a
delight
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
poor
example
of
the
style
with
some
expectations
for
the
style
this
beer
did
not
meet
them
i
can
easily
finish
the
bomber
but
it
is
just
not
what
i
wanted
i
am
not
sure
i
would
enjoy
more
than
a
single
serving
of
this
beer
not
my
thing
glad
to
have
had
the
opportunity
clown
shoes
another
offshoot
of
ipswich
mercury
not
sure
exactly
how
this
breweryies
works
exactly
but
they
all
tend
to
make
decent
to
great
beers
so
im
happy
to
see
this
distributed
up
to
maine
as
of
late
i
remember
this
coming
out
just
as
i
moved
from
boston
anywho
a
fresh
sample
feb
11
poured
into
my
imperial
nerax
pint
brown
with
red
tints
nice
head
receding
to
an
espressoesque
foam
laces
well
i
smell
chocolate
resiny
west
coast
hops
and
a
nice
earthy
musty
note
more
hops
up
front
at
first
gulp
nice
and
bitter
piney
and
sappy
a
touch
of
citrus
finishes
with
a
nice
dusty
chocolate
malt
backbone
i
really
like
this
beer
i
have
to
admit
to
being
a
bit
of
a
sucker
for
this
style
i
get
a
kick
out
the
debate
that
the
black
ipa
seems
to
stir
up
and
i
also
get
a
kick
out
of
drinking
it
hoppy
malty
and
somehow
balanced
and
refreshing
and
drinkable
and
robust
all
at
the
same
time
whats
not
to
like
look
forward
to
retrying
some
of
the
other
beers
these
guys
have
to
offer
beer
bottled
the
first
week
of
february
poured
into
my
rodenbach
glass
the
body
is
surprisingly
dark
sheeny
glass
black
like
a
moon
rock
with
a
hint
of
clear
crimson
in
the
middle
looks
awesome
a
light
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
best
looking
black
ipa
ive
seen
the
aroma
instantly
makes
me
think
of
a
west
coast
dipa
with
wonderful
fruity
grass
hop
notes
bet
this
is
even
better
fresh
on
tap
once
you
get
past
the
hops
on
the
front
there
is
a
caramel
backbone
with
a
hint
of
smoke
really
really
solid
my
only
complaint
is
that
wish
it
was
a
little
stronger
wow
this
is
strong
threw
me
off
guard
for
sure
tons
of
char
ash
alcohol
very
bitter
pine
hops
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
at
first
im
almost
disgusted
way
too
strong
the
more
i
drink
and
the
warms
settles
a
bit
however
wish
this
was
a
touch
more
subtle
with
a
better
mixture
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
very
sticky
with
tons
of
lasting
pine
and
alcohol
the
finish
and
alcohol
make
this
a
little
tough
to
crush
one
glass
is
enough
for
me
especially
considering
this
is
only
7
still
great
black
ipa
the
body
is
relatively
light
and
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
crispy
allowing
for
a
nice
drinking
experience
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
hoppy
black
ale
i
can
think
of
a
few
others
i
would
much
rather
have
i
have
only
had
two
beers
from
clown
shoes
this
and
brown
angel
brown
angel
was
very
nice
this
was
not
theres
also
a
little
inconsistency
in
the
flavor
even
though
the
aroma
is
pretty
tight
it
starts
off
like
coffee
moves
into
a
blend
of
dry
and
citrus
hops
and
then
on
the
very
back
end
theres
this
hint
of
like
nitrogen
only
its
not
nitrogen
its
just
a
little
unpleasant
medicinal
gas
this
is
quite
a
good
example
of
the
black
ipa
and
really
shows
the
difference
between
this
style
and
an
intensely
hopped
ris
the
beer
starts
with
a
sweet
malt
it
quickly
becomes
light
in
the
tongue
but
hops
take
over
spicy
and
citrus
pair
to
a
dry
slight
roasted
finish
leaving
a
big
bitter
on
the
tongue
i
was
quite
happy
to
see
this
on
the
shelves
in
chicago
a
big
very
welcome
surprise
edit
not
too
much
to
add
here
except
that
once
this
brew
warmed
up
the
balance
really
showed
through
perfect
symphony
of
roasted
malts
to
hoppy
bitterness
really
magnificent
not
my
favorite
clown
shoes
offering
but
i
will
definitely
try
it
again
if
i
can
find
it
on
tap
good
drinkability
nice
mix
of
dark
roast
flavors
hop
flavors
and
bitterness
good
drinkability
one
of
the
best
bipas
ive
had
quite
dry
bitter
and
roasty
a
good
example
of
a
burgeoning
style
the
thickness
medium
to
heavy
of
the
mouthfeel
helps
balance
the
bitterness
pretty
good
drinkability
the
lighter
mouthfeel
makes
it
ideal
for
having
more
than
a
pint
or
two
but
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
may
make
you
reach
for
something
else
after
1301
d
very
considering
this
beer
is
loaded
with
super
bitter
hops
this
way
my
first
black
ipa
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
almost
totally
black
in
color
with
a
2
inch
head
and
great
lacing
the
hops
and
roasted
malt
sweetness
comes
right
through
in
aroma
and
taste
a
like
the
citrusy
hops
certainly
dominate
as
any
good
ipa
but
there
is
a
sturdy
malt
back
bone
the
great
a
full
bodied
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
its
flavor
is
very
intense
in
the
beginning
but
doesnt
linger
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
ipa
nice
marriage
of
roasty
malts
and
loads
of
hops
i
should
probably
try
their
brown
ale
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
mix
of
pine
and
grapefruit
like
hops
and
a
nutty
sweet
roast
as
well
in
the
taste
starts
pine
to
grapefruity
hops
and
a
sweet
to
dry
nutty
maltiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
to
a
bid
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
grapefruit
like
hop
in
the
aftertaste
nice
hint
of
roast
and
nuttiness
and
huge
hops
which
was
not
expected
d
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
of
my
new
favorite
styles
black
ipa
it
is
very
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
even
better
is
the
hoppy
feet
1
5
though
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
the
hops
provide
an
impressive
head
not
pitch
black
though
certainly
dark
enough
for
the
style
soft
resin
hop
nose
builds
to
piney
minty
and
ruby
red
grapefruit
heightscombined
with
brownie
batter
and
a
faint
alcohol
theres
a
complex
aroma
very
lush
and
creamy
body
a
pleasure
to
sip
hoppiness
is
bold
but
not
too
aggressive
though
the
bit
terness
does
come
on
strong
dark
chocolate
and
toasted
bread
graininess
displays
a
great
base
some
yeast
and
fruiti
ness
in
the
back
are
covered
for
the
most
part
by
the
blanket
of
piney
citric
hop
flavor
east
coast
flexing
its
muscles
d
an
alright
beer
im
still
not
sold
on
this
style
i
really
enjoy
ipas
and
roasty
brews
but
not
sure
that
marrying
the
two
is
the
best
idea
well
this
beer
is
decently
bitter
with
both
roast
and
hops
like
a
simcoe
kind
of
bitterness
with
some
midpalate
lead
ins
on
the
road
to
more
hoppiness
the
forward
is
a
little
thin
with
some
sweetness
there
is
too
much
happening
the
back
half
of
the
beer
i
think
ultimately
that
it
is
ok
but
there
are
better
pairings
with
roastiness
and
hop
bitterness
than
these
malts
hops
make
pours
near
black
with
a
fairlygood
offwhite
to
tan
head
mild
lacing
and
a
thin
cap
the
nose
brings
forward
some
slight
roast
as
well
as
a
bit
of
hoppy
charactermostly
a
bit
of
pine
some
toasted
malt
in
the
background
as
well
nothing
really
seems
to
gel
here
the
taste
follows
along
the
same
lines
theres
some
roast
and
theres
some
pine
but
i
dont
really
get
anything
coming
together
the
finish
has
something
off
with
a
very
strange
dryness
a
bit
too
much
chocolate
for
the
style
the
finish
is
a
bit
astringent
i
liked
their
brown
much
better
something
about
this
one
just
didnt
really
work
for
me
wish
more
brewers
would
take
a
stab
at
this
style
and
i
expect
this
will
happen
in
11
this
is
a
welldone
example
of
a
black
ipa
though
i
like
laughing
dogs
and
loneriders
a
bit
more
i
would
not
hesitate
to
get
this
one
again
md
full
bodied
creamy
very
good
mouth
feel
drinkability
is
very
good
solid
beer
d
a
hugely
enjoyable
bipa
i
just
found
out
today
clown
shoes
is
coming
to
the
chicago
market
and
i
for
one
cant
wait
flavorful
offering
black
malts
more
dark
chocolate
lite
coffee
super
dry
with
citric
hopsgrapefruit
crashing
the
party
very
nice
complex
bold
and
well
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
drinkability
surprisingly
drinkable
for
such
a
big
beer
drinkability
black
ipas
are
quickly
beconing
my
new
fav
the
winter
time
ipa
would
have
scored
it
higher
but
the
carbonation
filled
me
up
with
the
unneeded
gas
notes
wow
thats
a
bitter
frickin
black
ipa
almost
too
bitter
if
there
ever
were
such
a
thing
huge
amounts
of
hops
must
go
in
for
bittering
i
think
i
like
it
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
have
had
better
examples
of
the
style
worth
a
shot
though
as
there
are
not
that
many
examples
out
there
yet
drinkability
is
good
very
nice
black
ipa
kind
of
wish
it
was
hoppier
but
its
still
quite
tasty
and
well
worth
trying
by
the
way
great
name
for
a
brewery
although
mercury
brewing
co
gets
the
credit
clown
shoes
sounds
so
much
better
thanks
again
alan
d
the
heavy
amount
of
bitter
and
metal
aftertaste
is
severely
limiting
the
drinkability
for
me
that
said
i
finished
a
bomber
in
about
20
minutes
so
it
is
drinkable
i
just
wouldnt
reach
for
another
one
right
away
very
dark
brown
but
not
quite
opaque
purplish
highlights
with
rubychestnut
edges
fluffy
tan
cap
just
short
of
2
that
left
lots
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
great
head
retention
the
aroma
was
quite
hoppy
up
front
but
presented
considerable
malt
depth
at
times
chocolate
caramel
and
slight
roastburnt
hops
were
resinous
and
piney
some
citrus
rind
more
of
the
same
in
the
flavour
pine
and
caramel
dominating
but
with
some
citrus
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
licorice
present
as
well
strong
bitterness
more
than
balanced
the
other
flavours
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
texture
from
the
wellintegrated
carbonation
a
bit
astringent
though
giving
it
more
dryness
than
it
needs
overall
i
liked
this
solid
hoppiness
with
a
nice
depth
of
malt
makes
for
a
tasty
beer
picked
up
two
bottles
of
clown
shoes
and
this
was
the
second
of
the
night
shared
with
my
wife
as
it
was
poured
into
stemmed
glasses
totally
black
color
with
a
contrasting
white
head
i
was
surprised
how
long
the
head
lasted
quick
thick
and
good
looking
smell
was
pungent
with
citrus
and
floral
hops
very
fresh
aroma
taste
was
balanced
for
the
style
plenty
of
hops
but
there
was
also
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
just
a
bit
of
roasted
coffee
flavor
mouthfeel
had
a
nice
thickness
to
it
but
it
was
very
smooth
and
drinkable
at
the
same
time
this
beer
basically
nailed
it
in
every
category
from
pour
to
finish
a
pleasure
to
drink
clown
shoes
has
really
impressed
me
a
solid
cda
liked
how
the
roastiness
was
muted
to
allow
the
hops
to
shine
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
beer
d
a
big
flavored
beer
not
much
alc
a
22oz
was
more
then
enough
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
not
amazing
but
good
dont
bother
hunting
this
one
but
def
try
if
you
like
an
interesting
blend
on
ipas
and
have
access
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
style
is
very
interesting
in
that
it
has
qualities
of
an
american
ipa
or
pale
ale
as
well
as
those
of
a
porter
or
irish
dry
stout
this
would
go
well
with
grilled
meat
drinks
very
well
hoppy
and
roasty
at
the
same
time
a
very
good
example
of
the
upandcoming
style
easily
their
best
beer
and
a
good
one
to
make
your
name
from
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
its
actually
relatively
cheap
and
near
the
upper
tier
so
i
see
myself
drinking
this
often
overall
this
is
something
that
i
would
love
with
a
nice
steak
i
generally
shy
away
from
such
hoppy
beers
but
this
was
a
real
stunner
for
me
and
something
that
may
have
me
reconsidering
my
tastes
this
is
a
very
tasty
well
balanced
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
it
may
be
my
standard
for
black
ipas
d
really
solid
digging
this
big
time
from
clownshoes
the
7
is
weird
some
sips
its
nicely
masked
yet
in
others
its
really
in
your
face
i
had
this
at
a
random
tasting
clownshoes
was
doing
at
julios
and
picked
up
a
bunch
of
bottle
on
sale
this
makes
me
want
to
crack
the
labyrinth
ive
been
aging
to
compare
as
labyrinth
was
the
complete
package
when
i
tasted
this
would
like
to
see
how
it
stacks
up
to
this
the
pour
revealed
a
black
beer
with
a
nice
head
on
the
lighter
side
of
tan
the
lacing
was
spectalur
and
followed
the
beer
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
nose
has
citus
hops
and
a
slight
tinge
of
dark
malt
the
taste
was
light
on
the
citrus
hops
one
dimensional
maltsporter
like
and
a
bitter
afterbite
that
was
quite
pleasant
this
beer
was
smooth
with
a
good
carbonation
level
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
bitter
black
malt
scent
along
with
a
very
nice
citrus
hop
nose
its
not
a
complex
malt
aroma
and
the
hops
really
shine
through
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
very
bitter
hop
flavor
that
works
well
with
the
dry
black
malts
it
goes
down
smooth
with
loads
of
hops
that
resinate
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
black
ipa
it
has
excellent
hop
character
and
a
solid
malt
base
d
wow
this
one
is
very
different
but
also
very
good
easy
to
drink
and
very
solid
it
seems
like
there
are
several
different
beers
in
one
one
sip
is
hoppy
next
one
is
almost
like
a
porter
very
cool
had
a
glass
at
deep
ellum
along
with
some
tasty
parmesan
fries
this
is
a
pretty
decent
take
on
the
style
the
malt
background
is
a
bit
more
like
a
irish
dry
stout
than
anything
with
its
dry
and
bitter
roasted
character
the
hops
are
predominantly
citrusy
and
amplifies
the
dry
character
unfortunately
the
hops
and
malt
blend
instead
layering
flavor
extremely
strong
contrasting
roasted
chocolate
malt
and
grapefruit
hops
taste
matches
with
a
surpsringly
well
balance
dispute
the
strongness
at
both
ends
drinkablity
is
high
and
mouthfeel
is
good
the
best
black
ipa
out
there
in
a
bottle
drinkability
im
a
bit
confused
because
this
is
supposed
have
ipa
characteristics
no
but
there
were
very
few
if
any
hardly
any
hops
or
citrus
flavors
and
mostly
porter
or
milk
stoutlike
sweetness
again
very
very
confused
i
cant
say
i
didnt
enjoy
it
but
for
the
style
either
i
dont
dig
it
its
deceiving
or
something
was
weird
with
the
brew
here
not
sure
dstrong
flavors
generously
allow
the
drinkability
to
be
high
i
had
this
at
the
sunset
grill
on
a
recent
visit
to
boston
it
was
a
very
good
ipa
and
the
black
aspect
adds
a
lot
to
it
i
think
this
is
the
first
black
single
ipa
ive
had
having
recently
had
some
black
doubles
color
is
very
dark
but
the
head
is
relatively
light
low
carbonation
good
hop
aroma
with
good
hop
flavor
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
ill
have
it
again
if
it
ever
comes
to
new
york
review
from
notes
taken
on
572010
tasting
thanks
to
reagan1984
for
introducing
me
to
these
guys
pours
a
jet
black
color
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipates
without
much
lacing
left
behind
a
nice
citrus
hop
aroma
not
overpowering
as
the
roasted
malts
are
also
present
in
the
end
it
is
a
pleasant
aroma
but
i
really
like
more
late
addition
hops
in
my
ipas
even
black
ones
rather
pronounced
bitterness
in
the
flavor
there
are
some
citrus
flavors
there
but
bitterness
takes
on
a
metallic
characteristic
and
practically
overwhelms
the
roasted
malts
rather
thin
body
with
medium
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
good
start
for
this
beer
as
most
of
the
negatives
i
found
in
it
could
be
worked
out
with
different
hop
usagetiming
since
its
a
new
brewery
i
look
forward
to
future
batches
to
see
if
they
balance
out
the
hops
a
bit
more
d
fair
strong
aftertaste
that
stays
on
the
tongue
after
you
finish
your
drink
i
bought
a
case
for
cellaring
will
be
interesting
to
see
how
it
ages
ive
only
had
one
maybe
2
other
brown
ipas
and
i
wasnt
really
impressed
but
this
is
a
game
changer
for
me
i
really
liked
it
and
would
recommend
trying
it
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
the
black
ipa
style
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
enough
flavor
substance
and
complexity
to
make
it
worth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
im
starting
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
black
ipas
just
arent
my
thing
this
combination
of
flavors
somehow
works
better
when
it
comes
from
aggressively
dryhopping
a
stout
rather
than
adding
black
malt
to
an
ipa
recipe
i
think
because
there
are
less
bittering
hops
and
alpha
acids
i
like
bitterness
as
much
as
the
next
hophead
but
in
conjunction
with
bitter
dark
chocolate
it
gets
a
little
tiresome
for
some
reason
the
label
of
this
one
put
me
off
from
trying
it
for
a
while
too
bad
i
really
like
it
d
would
jay
and
silent
bob
enjoy
this
beer
you
bet
because
theyre
fucking
clown
shoes
seriously
though
this
beer
straddles
the
line
between
hoppy
ipa
and
chewy
stout
ive
really
been
warming
up
to
this
black
ipa
substyle
lately
and
this
was
a
good
one
that
was
just
loaded
with
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
roast
and
whoes
profile
seriously
towed
the
line
with
what
you
might
find
in
a
lighter
version
of
a
hoppy
imperial
stout
makes
me
wish
that
i
had
picked
up
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
d
if
you
like
the
style
and
like
this
beer
it
is
definitely
drinkable
personally
i
was
not
wowed
or
blown
away
but
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
d
enjoyable
to
sip
this
one
over
an
hour
or
more
this
is
quite
an
impressive
beer
im
definitely
excited
to
try
something
from
a
new
brewery
and
this
is
not
a
bad
start
but
i
think
the
hop
bitterness
is
a
bit
overdone
in
the
flavor
given
the
relative
lack
of
real
hop
flavors
still
not
bad
very
hopforward
on
the
tongue
citrusy
and
lightly
herbal
with
a
touch
of
bittersweet
chocolate
light
and
semicrisp
the
malt
profile
is
pretty
dry
and
subtle
taking
a
backseat
to
the
big
hop
flavors
the
finish
is
pleasantly
bitter
and
biting
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
pretty
damn
good
thanks
arbi
a
very
decent
beer
and
a
nice
spin
on
the
ipa
if
i
ever
see
this
beer
available
for
sale
where
i
live
i
wont
hesitate
to
pick
up
another
bottle
o
this
a
tasty
black
ipa
i
havent
had
a
bad
one
yet
and
this
one
keeps
reminding
me
how
delicous
this
style
is
i
see
the
black
ipa
style
growing
very
popular
very
good
overall
solid
hop
lineup
with
an
interesting
malt
backbone
that
brings
more
to
the
beer
than
just
balance

this
beer
grew
on
me
i
like
this
beer
and
wonder
if
its
the
perfect
call
when
you
are
confused
between
a
hoppy
beer
or
a

well
done
the
beers
only
7
and
it
doesnt
taste
extremely
warm
or
anything
crazy
still
it
took
me
a
little
while
to
get
through
because
of
how
rich
it
is
definitely
enjoyed
it
but
if
you
arent
already
a
hophead
who
wants
to
appreciate
the
fade
from
one
bitter
flavor
to
the
next
it
might
just
taste
overwhelmingly
bitter
drinkability
by
far
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
there
is
a
clear

the

in
this
beer

im
really
digging
it

good

but
not

overall
what
a
great
way
to
commemorate
one
year
on
the
market
their

did
wonders
for
advancing
the
style
of
american

or
however
you
feel
comfortable
calling
it
it
showcases
a
dense
malt
base
with
a
floating
crown
of
fresh
hoppiness
here
we
truly
get
the
enhanced
version
of
this
although
it
is
most
noticeable
in
the
bitterness
and
depth
of
the
flavor
profile
they
also
take
the

through

just

pint
of
this

beast
can
send
an
advocate
reeling
despite
this
the
beer
drinks
with
a
definite
smoothness
allowing
you
every
opportunity
to
appreciate
the
flavors
as
they
continually
drift
by
the
taste
buds
it
is
nice
that
clown
shoes
appreciates
their
roots
but
even
nicer
that
they
take
care
of
the
consumer
by
literally
building
off
their
prior
successes
to
offer
something
even
better
good
on
you
clown
shoes
this
bipa
pours
a
very
near
black
color
with
a
generous
tan
head
that
lasts
well
into
the
pour
and
leaves
very
substantial
lacing
the
aroma
was
far
maltier
than
i
had
expected
for
an
imperial
black
ipa
the
same
can
be
said
for
the
flavor
although
that
was
more
complex
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
coffee
present
overall
this
one
seemed
closer
to
porter
or
even
stout
than
black
ipa
would
have
enjoyed
a
hoppier
presence
like
its
little
brother
hoppy
feet
outlived
my
expectations
intense
there
is
nothing
subtle
about
this
beer
if
you
like
the
clashing
of
two
worlds
this
beer
is
most
certainly
for
you
whether
youre
a
hophead
or
you
prefer
to
indulge
in
sweet
malts
i
think
youll
be
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
i
highly
recommend
picking
this
one
up
and
i
also
recommend
bringing
a
friend
along
for
the
ride
attempting
to
tackling
a
bottle
of
this
alone
is
madness
overall
my
first
black
ipa
and
i
wasnt
disappointed
its
strong
in
both
the
malt
and
hops
department
and
theyre
blended
together
very
well
great
beer
will
buy
again
smooth
and
a
really
great
drinking
ale
over
all
for
the
alcohol
content
its
well
hidden
o
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
nice
blend
of
malts
and
hops
very
enjoyable
o
another
solid
beer
from
clown
shoes
just
a
bit
let
down
due
to
the
absence
of
hop
bite
i
was
looking
for
bottle
poured
a
pitchblack
color
ale
with
a
nice
dark
brown
foamy
head
with
medium
retention
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
consists
of
bitter
roasted
malt
with
some
dry
hoppy
notes
taste
is
also
dominated
by
bitter
roasted
malt
with
quit
a
powerful
dry
hoppy
finish
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
i
thought
this
was
a
bit
too
dry
imho
i
like
my
black
ales
hoppy
and
this
one
falls
a
little
short
even
the
maltiness
is
evened
out
too
much
despite
having
good
character
and
potential
ive
never
had
the
regular
hoppy
feet
to
know
what
this
beer
is
really
trying
to
accomplish
but
still
it
makes
its
mark
not
fantastic
but
solid
nonetheless
intense
and
unforgiving
black
in
color
just
the
faintest
hint
of
light
peeks
through
this
brew
when
held
up
to
the
light
not
much
head
on
this
beer
massive
aroma
of
pacific
northwest
hops
combined
with
roasted
malt
plums
raisins
and
black
licorice
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
sticky
flavor
is
an
initial
wallop
of
hop
bitterness
followed
closely
by
roasted
malt
fig
raisins
and
plum
the
aftertaste
hastily
returns
back
to
a
strong
bitter
hop
fade
an
epic
roller
coaster
for
your
palate
that
will
delight
those
seeking
darkbitter
beers
my
first
clown
shoes
brew
but
when
i
travel
i
will
seek
out
their
other
brews
as
they
dont
distribute
in
mo
overall
this
is
quite
a
solid
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
sipping
it
was
hard
getting
through
the
22oz
bomber
by
myself
but
that
is
just
because
this
thing
is
a
beast
of
a
brew
at

abv
clown

hoppy

black
ipa
was
a
favorite
of
mine
the
glb
so
tasty
and
perfect
imho
so
i
decided
to
give
this
a
try
it
poured
from
the
bottle
an
impressive
dark
colorhead
the
nose
was
really
nice
sipping
revealed
the
booziness
of
this
brew
which
unfortunately
seemed
to
mask
much
of
the
flavor
but
i
enjoyed
sipping
on
this
nevertheless
o
pretty
good
o
this
is
great
sometimes
with
these
big
black
ipas
i
find
the
hop
flavors
muddled
in
the
background
and
cant
really
differ
them
from
a
really
hoppy
imperial
porter
this
is
a
straight
mash
up
of
bright
ipa
hop
flavor
and
ibus
with
delicious
roasted
malts
the
nose
was
a
little
pungent
with
the
alcohol
but
the
taste
was
more
smooth
a
little
hot
though
great
beer
will
continue
to
enjoy

a
highly

offering
o
black
ipas
are
quite
hard
to
perfect
i
have
to
give
them
credit
they
did
make
a
10
percent
taste
pretty
darn
good
but
there
are
a
few
things
they
could
improve
upon
would
i
buy
it
again
depends
on
my
mood
but
as
far
as
normal
beers
go
i
commend
clown
shoes
for
there
experimentation
and
might
have
to
try
some
of
there
more
classic
beers
to
see
how
this
brewery
overall
standing
is
an
eyepopping
black
ipa
good
complexity
and
nicely
balanced
throughout
hops
and
malts
hit
you
first
and
the
tingling
then
soothing
alcohol
warmth
lingers
on
at
the
finish
quality
control
please
fquick
bitterness
on
the
end
leaving
evidence
of
hops
roast
and
alcohol
in
its
wake
overall
this
is
a
great
aba
this
style
has
been
pretty
popular
lately
and
this
is
a
good
take
on
it
the
roasted
notes
are
extremely
well
balanced
with
the
piney
hop
notes
the
black
ale
is
decent
enough
though
for
me
black
ipas
are
a
very
touchy
style
easily
hit
or
miss
though
this
is
one
of
the
few
that
falls
in
between
its
far
from
bad
but
the
palate
wrecking
that
happens
sooner
than
halfway
through
the
glass
is
enough
to
bog
down
the
drinkability
like
a
two
ton
weight
this
would
be
perfect
in
46
oz
serving
sizes
anything
more
is
tough
o
i
imagined
a
beer
like
hoppy
feet
but
i
got
a
completely
different
animal
i
love
it
if
you
see
it
buy
it
overall
a
very
unique
beer
this
is
more
citrusy
than
their
clementine
beer
the
only
black
ipa
that
can
beat
this
would
perhaps
be

get
on
your

sticks
and
chase
it
my
children
chase
it
well
and
good
this
is
more
like
a
really
alcoholic
roasty
porter
than
an
ipa
of
any
sort
i
still
like
it
ok
but
it
could
come
down
a
notch
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thick
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
packs
a
bit
more
of
an
alcohol
kick
but
otherwise
is
almost
indistinguishable
from
regular
hoppy
feet
in
my
opinion
overall
a
very
nice
cascadian
black
ale
from
clown
shoes
tasty
and
well
crafted
o
great
black
ipa
i
will
be
seeking
out
more
by
clown
shoes
after
this
beer
great
brew
by
clown
shoes
as
a
true
hophead
this
was
a
great
mix
of
styles
o
if
someone
had
told
me
this
is
a
belgian
stout
i
would
have
believed
them
not
as
hoppy
as
reg
hoppy
feet
more
body
more
roasty
pretty
interesting
beer
heavy
on
the
chocolate
due
to
the
alcohol
a
sipper
for
sure
not
bad
but
probably
a
little
better
when
fresh
the
bitterness
may
counteract
some
of
the
sweet
alcoholic
flavors
not
sure
if
i
would
have
another
o
4
75
i
dig
everything
going
on
here
especially
in
a
style
that
i
dont
particular
like
i
tend
to
prefer
roastier
dark
beers
like
ris
and
porters
and
i
wonder
if
the
age
on
this
beer
with
the
high
abv
is
increasing
the
appeal
for
me
regardless
id
be
curious
to
try
this
one
fresh
but
it
has
definitely
piqued
my
interest
in
v1
0
as
well
overall
ive
enjoyed
it
it
wasnt
anything
ill
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
in
the
future
but
that
being
said
it
was
certainly
above
average
and
a
great
way
to
end
a
long
day
o
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
think
hoppy
feet
regular
is
a
little
more
subtle
and
thus
complex
the
big
roast
of
1
5
masks
andor
blunts
a
lot
of
the
nuances
that
i
like
in
hoppy
feet
original
not
a
bad
beer
and
worth
a
try
a
pitch
black
brew
with
a
big
foamy
light
brown
head
and
unfailing
blankets
of
lacing
the
aroma
delivers
some
nutty
malt
along
with
a
bit
of
alcohol
that
makes
for
a
little
dishwater
edge
so
the
aroma
sort
of
cancels
into
a
wash

is
a
very
well
balanced
beer
that
hides
its

very
well
its
very
drinkable
and
quite
flavorful
hopefully
this

will
become

o
a
really
nice
beer
this
style
is
right
up
my
alley
and
terrapin
does
a
good
job
executing
it
what
can
i
say
not
bad
but
i
just
like
black
ipas
love
almost
all
of
terrapins
brews
but
this
one
just
doesnt
do
much
for
me
o
not
bad
but
not
what
id
call
an
ipa
a
hoppy
dry
stoutporter
perhaps
d
nice
roasty
black
ipa
more
of
a
porter
quite
carbonated
smokey
and
a
tad
acidic
a
grassy
undertone
good
wintertime
brew
o
aggressively
bitter
serving
type
bottle
flavor
more
balanced
unlike
many
black
ipas
imo
this
one
successfully
integrates
the
substantial
hop
load
with
a
substantial
amount
of
medium
and
dark
malts
its
success
is
due
in
large
part
i
suspect
to
not
going
overboard
with
the
ingredients
terrapin
also
has
done
a
fine
job
of
matching
the
malts
to
the
hops
dark
in
color
no
distinguishable
flavor
a
not
particularly
good
beer
imho
this
is
supposedly
only
available
in
the
box
set
so
it
appears
that
the
seller
broke
the
set
down
to
sell
the
individual
bottles
usually
the
offerings
from
terrapin
range
from
good
to
very
good
i
have
to
assume
that
this
sample
was
mishandled
somewhere
along
the
line
if
i
can
find
another
ill
update
this
review
right
off
the
bat
have
heard
some
pretty
good
things
about
terrapin
and
who
wouldnt
love
the
grateful
dead
reference
anyways

enjoy
by

nice
flavors
of
coffee
up

with
a
nice
bitter
middle
note
as
well
as
a
nit
of
a
floral
hoppy
taste
as
it
warmed
up
for
a
black
ipa
maybe
just
a
bit
lagging
on
the
flavor
complexity
wanted
a
bit
more
hop
flavor
to
balance
the
nice
maltiness
and
appropriate
amount
of
bittering
great
mouthfeel
reminiscent
of
a
nice
porter
or
bipa
overall
a
decent
beer
but
i
would
likely
chase
down
a
selfrighteous
or
nighttime
if
the
options
were
available
decent
grade
for
the
style
overall
it
was
worth
picking
up
and
i
am
glad
these
are
being
released
cheaper
as
12
oz
offerings
in
a
way
though
it
was
like
that
peanut
butter
porter
they
made
ok
but
it
wasnt
super
tasty
overall
ive
got
to
admit
that
the
black
ipa
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
still
try
them
out
on
occasion
hoping
to
find
one
that
ill
loveand
now
i
have

not
really
as

the

consensus
was
that
it

much
closer
to
a

than
a

the

no

enjoyable
d
definitely
a
repeat
beer
d
i
almost
wonder
if
i
got
a
different
beer
than
everyone
else
as
i
found
this
beer
to
be
one
of
the
most
restrained
black
ipas
ive
had
with
only
a
light
flavor
of
roasted
malts
and
a
still
able
to
retain
a
lot
of
the
typical
ipa
character
d
pretty
nice
im
not
having
any
issues
with
the
bomber
again
a
good
beer
but
it
seems
to
be
having
a
bit
of
an
identity
crisis
overall
this
is
a
decent
intepretation
of
a
black
ipa
but
if
i
tasted
it
blindly
i
would
have
called
it
a
overly
coffeed
baltic
porter
needed
more
balanced
somewhere
the
black
ipa
is
not
a
beer
which
should
be
imperialized
in
my
opinion

a
pretty

from

dbig
and
bold
with
a
ton
of
roast
too
much
actually
this
is
the
downfall
of
this
brew
for
me
i
got
through
my
pint
but
had
no
desire
for
a
repeat
has
promise
but
this
brew
needs
some
work
if
it
is
to
made
again
interesting
brew
theres
hints
of
a
heavilyhopped
stout
here
if
thats
your
thing
this
would
be
a
good
one
for
you
m
the
feel
is
fairly
thick
with
light
carbonation

finish
for
the

i
was
a
bit
confused
with
this
aspect
assertively
hoppy
a
bit
hop
but
nice
dark
roasted
malts
work
oaky
with
the
combination
of
the
two
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
healthy
dose
of
carbonation
carried
things
across
the
palate
a
touch
cloying
at
times
but
this
beer
had
no
time
getting
down
our
gullets
solid
drinkability
i
was
hoping
to
find
this
on
tap
but
never
did
catch
it
flowing
in
the
burgh
d
enjoyable
but
not
particularly
complex
the
malt
is
kind
of
one
dimensional
with
some
notes
of
caramel
and
moderate
roasted
notes
the
malt
is
subdued
enough
to
the
hops
shine
through
but
it
does
impart
a
bit
of
dark
flavor
that
brings
out
the
pine
and
creates
notes
of
blue
cheese
and
mustard
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
with
a
particularly
pleasant
hop
character
thought
this
was
coming
out
in
julyaugust
based
on
reports
from
febmarch
then
it
never
made
it
here
then
thought
september
or
maybe
october
then
finally
showed
up
along
with
a
more
recent
side
project
terrapin
has
really
botched
their
distribution
to
fl
thus
i
cant
give
2
shits
if
this
is
maybe
is
possibly
2
months
old
but
this
one
held
up
pretty
well
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
not
great
just
decent
seems
more
like
a
porter
or
milk
stout
to
me
try
if
you
like
roasty
beers
received
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
poured
a
medium
black
color
with
a
creamy
beige
head
on
the
nose
this
one
had
a
nice
roasty
smell
roasted
malt
light
cocoa
and
finally
floral
hops
on
the
palate
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
very
roasty
up
front
even
more
so
as
it
warms
before
the
hops
show
themselves
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
bit
more
carbo
but
the
flavors
of
this
brew
make
up
for
it
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
pours
near
black
with
a
bit
of
head
nose
is
some
citrus
hops
and
a
good
deal
of
roast
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
dry
with
roast
hints
of
coffee
nice
citrus
and
a
bit
of
pine
medium
body
pretty
good
itd
take
on
the
good
captain
again
easy
drinker
the
eyes
play
drinks
on
the
buds
and
the
brain
this
one
is
pitch
black
but
drinks
and
tastes
like
ipa
interesting
and
delicious
a
little
disappointed
in
the
lack
of
noticeable
roastiness
but
i
liked
it
anyway
beer
is
a
porter
not
an
ipa
there
is
almost
no
bitterness
or
hop
character
in
the
mouth
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
some
mild
sweetness
in
the
front
and
then
the
roast
in
the
back
not
much
in
between
though
i
was
really
hoping
this
was
hoppy
its
not
thanks
again
geoff
this
was
a
super
trade
looking
forward
toward
december
d
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
a
night
if
i
had
the
money
drank
it
fairly
well
d
nothing
really
special
about
this
one
but
the
beer
itself
is
not
too
pretentious
also
i
really
love
the
bottle
art
pours
deep
copper
to
a
black
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
roast
and
a
small
hop
in
the
taste
mellow
grapefruit
like
hops
and
a
sweet
roasty
malt
a
bitter
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
grapefruity
hop
in
the
aftertaste
mellow
nose
but
big
flavor
i
can
dig
it
d
this
was
a
very
nice
black
ipa
that
brought
great
balance
of
super
clean
hops
with
dark
roasty
malts
the
roasted
character
was
a
bit
harsh
but
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
it
had
nice
body
too
so
it
was
overall
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
another
solid
terrapin
beer
thanks
grant
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
more
of
a
mild
hopped
porter
good
but
does
not
live
up
to
the
hype
and
a
little
expensive
d
tried
this
in
the
summer
and
it
was
a
bit
hot
for
this
beer
good
but
not
great
in
110
degrees
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
its
just
damn
tastey
and
goes
down
easily
does
it
blow
me
away
not
necessarily
but
its
just
quite
delicious
and
rolls
across
the
tongue
wonderfully
sampled

at
savor

black

here
with
strong

that
melded
well
with
the
darker
aspects
of
the

just
enough
smooth

keep
the

given
the

or
whatever
these
things
are
called

age
pretty
damn
well
the
generally
robust
complex

body
make
for
a
beer
that
like
many
higher

will
age
quite
gracefully
an
interesting
note
given
the
lack
of
proper
aging
potential
for
most
actual

in
the

and

in
the
middle
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
could
be
a
bit
creamier
but
fine
nonetheless
as
much
as
it
pains
me
to
try
this
outside

and
insanely
rare

will
trudge

the

o
fruity
hop
aromas
with
ruby
red
grapefruit
leading
the
way
and
some
smooth
semitoasted
caramel
coming
through
as
well
the
taste
begins
heavily
in
favor
of
the
grapefruity
hops
as
the
hops
fade
into
the
background
the
caramel
steps
in
along
with
a
touch
of
light
coffee
the
finish
has
all
of
these
elements
take
a
bow
as
the
music
slowly
dies
away
and
the
lights
gradually
come
down
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
rather
creamy
feel
im
glad
i
was
able
to
enjoy
the
krunkles
experience
especially
after
the
hype
consider
it
livedupto
d
drinkability
is
good
all
the
flavors
come
together
to
make
an
interesting
and
quaffable
brew
the
abv
seems
a
tad
lighter
than
whats
listed
but
that
only
helps
this
category
would
i
have
a
problem
putting
away
a
bomber
no
would
i
have
another
yes
but
not
in
the
same
session
glad
i
got
to
try
another
of
the
usually
solid
side
projects
from
terrapin
much
appreciated
josh
captn
krunkles
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
it
has
a
good
flavor
and
doesnt
make
any
huge
missteps
on
the
journey
the
nose
would
benefit
from
a
little
more
strength
and
perhaps
the
charredburnt
flavor
could
be
toned
down
a
little
overall
though
this
is
good
stuff
definitely
worth
checking
out
if
the
opportunity
presents
itself
drinkability
my
palate
is
getting
a
bit
of
bitterness
overload
and
i
havent
even
finished
the
bottle
yet
an
interesting
brew
but
i
wouldnt
want
another
this
rare
bomber
poured
out
black
with
a
large
brownish
head
good
retention
and
lacing
all
around
looks
great
fruity
with
citrus
and
pineapple
mitigated
by
roasted
malts
appealing
nose
taste
is
smokey
with
assertive
hop
backbone
that
has
a
pervasive
fruityresinous
streak
that
leads
to
a
grapefruity
midpalate
with
high
bitterness
and
a
highly
roasted
coffeelike
and
cookielike
finish
this
one
is
pretty
heavy
on
the
roast
while
the
hops
are
here
in
full
force
they
seem
onenote
in
comparison
to
the
vastness
of
the
malt
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
which
works
for
the
ipa
factor
but
not
so
much
with
the
huge
roast
notes
interesting
beer
for
sure
i
would
have
it
again
but
the
balance
isnt
quite
ideal
for
me
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
assertive
hop
presence
here
perhaps
like
stones
sublime
still
its
a
nice
sipper
and
very
drinkable

hit
the
shelves
would
try
again
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
one
again
at
all
im
not
sure
why
others
would
want
to
either
but
thats
why
our
palates
are
different
ill
leave
this
for
someone
else
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
take
on
an
emerging
style
a
ramped
up
hop
bill
might
not
be
a
bad
idea
but
its
decent
as
is
on
the
whole
capn
krunkles
is
pretty
solid
may
he
sail

pillage
along

way
hopefully
time
finds
him
with
refined
sailing
skills
a
more
bountiful
stash
of
loot
mfd
pretty
big
body
with
a
mildly
aggressive
carbonation
overall
it
feels
good
on
the
palate
pretty
easy
to
put
this
bomber
down
although
i
split
it
drinkability
was
average
id
love
to
see
this
reworked
because
terrapin
has
it
in
them
to
make
an
awesome
black
ipa
this
however
is
not
it
id
rather
drive
this
crummy
rental
car
for
the
rest
of
the
year
than
drink
another
bottle
of
this
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
snifter
it
appears
a
dark
brown
to
nearly
black
color
with
a
creamy
tan
head
about
a
finger
strong
with
pretty
good
retension
spotty
amount
of
lace
clings
to
the
glass
aroma
is
citrus
hops
upfront
with
a
nice
dark
malt
character
with
both
chocolate
and
coffee
in
the
back
taste
is
citrus
hop
bitterness
upfront
with
more
bitterness
contributed
by
the
dark
roasted
malts
little
bit
of
yeast
character
is
included
in
the
flavor
lasting
taste
of
hops
and
dark
grains
left
in
the
mouth
with
an
increasing
amount
of
alcohol
as
the
beer
warms
light
feel
with
a
mild
level
of
carbonation
10
bucks
a
pop
wow
terrapin
is
pricing
themselves
out
of
my
pocket
book
overall
a
decently
drinkable
beer
much
better
than
my
last
bipa
shame
they
wasted
such
a
great
name
on
such
a
bad
beer
pours
black
but
is
an
ipa
odd
but
we
will
go
with
it
smell
of
offroasted
dark
malts
and
some
old
hops
not
enough
hops
taste
is
similar
but
the
hops
just
dont
mesh
with
the
darker
malts
and
add
mostly
bitterness
pine
element
is
more
like
floor
cleaner
than
grapefruit
d
drinkable
beverage
if
you
enjoy
the
beer
with
a
body
of
a
stout
and
the
flavor
of
an
ipa
this
is
the
sphinx
of
beer
but
since
the
abv
is
only
7
5
drink
away
an
interesting
combination
of
flavors
in
this
one
would
like
to
have
it
again
the
mouthfeel
id
say
is
a
little
above
medium
bodied
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
decent
it
melded
some
pretty
good
flavors
together
that
said
i
think
id
still
like
the
flavors
better
separately
in
a
good
ipa
and
stout
still
a
pretty
tasty
and
interesting
beer
though
the
beer
pours
black
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
heavy
on
the
smoke
with
some
roasted
malt
as
well
the
flavor
is
earthy
hops
smoke
and
roasted
malt
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
as
much
hop
presence
as
i
expected
from
the
term
black
ipa
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
almost
more
like
an
american
imperial
stout
than
the
relatively
new
americanstyle
india
black
ale
with
its
heavy
roasted
character

a

just
a

subtle
and
a

funky
slightly
hoppy
but
also
roasty
and
dark
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rather
light
it
could
actually
use
s
little
more
body
the
flavor
is
not
particularly
hoppy
mostly
just
light
coffee
notes
and
a
little
citrus
almost
closer
to
a
light
porter
than
a
bipa
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
hunt
down
overall
a
very
decent
brew
but
not
sure
which
way
they
are
trying
to
go
with
it
very
good
brew
but
more
of
a
porter
no
black
ipa
works
too
i
suppose
but
either
way
it
tastes
very
good
a
little
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
cheers
a
really
good
beer
but
a
definite
nearmiss
it
is
gorgeous
for
a
black
ipa
as
dark
as
a
porter
and
the
mouthfeel
is
comparable
to
porters
thick
and
creamy
and
very
appealing
the
taste
is
solid
but
not
outstanding
for
a
black
ipa
everything
is
good
but
nothing
stands
out
roasted
malt
a
bit
of
coffee
a
strong
but
not
particularly
distinct
hop
presence
in
the
taste
and
in
the
nose
it
is
a
well
balanced
beer
for
this
style
which
is
nice
many
are
not
but
black
ipas
to
me
should
be
bold
and
distinct
i
like
this
beer
a

and
think
it
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
when

its
a
black

with
a
personality
of
its
own
greenbush
is
the
newest
in
a
long
line
of
michigan
microbreweries
to
impress
the
heck
out
of
me
as
if
that
state
didnt
have
enough
good
beer
already
im
angry
they
didnt
setup
shop
where
i
live
not
my
favorite
but
a
decent
offering
from
greenbush
overall
a
great
offering
from
greenbush
and
enjoyable
perfect
for
the
cold
weather
season
here
in
the
midwest
when
you
still
crave
the
hops
but
want
something
a
little
more
robust
overall
id
have
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
such
a
great
beer
for
this
time
of
year
when
you
dont
want
the
total
stout
o
overall
this
is
a
very
straightforward
well
executed
black
ipa
the
appearance
needs
some
work
as
the
head
is
simply
unruly
overall
after
tasting
the
founders
black
ipa
i
was
ready
to
write
this
style
off
entirely
im
glad
i
didnt
im
headed
back
to
the
store
for
a
six
pack
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
black
ipa
to
date
i
love
the
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
roasted
malt
most
black
ipas
are
hop
bombs
with
roasted
malt
this
is
more
like
a
hoppy
stout
the
hops
compliment
this
beer
perfectly
it
pairs
well
with
metallicas
st
anger
song
or
the
album
i
liked
the
aroma
the
most
and
the
taste
was
good
i
think
this
one
was
meant
to
be
abrasive
hence
the
name
so
i
guess
they
hit
the
target
pretty
good
heavy
hitting
black
ipa
my
first
sample
of
greenbush
just
a
stones
throw
from
warren
dunes
heaven
on
earth
greenbush
is
new
to
my
market
i
have
tried
three
of
their
beers
and
would
recommend
each
of
them
the
anger
is
one
of
the
best
dark
ales
ive
had
poured

pour
dark
cola
brown
with
generous
brown
head
with
nice
retention
and
plenty
of
lacing
nose
is
hop
forward
with
pine
being
the
main
note
notes
of
roasted
barley
caramel
and
pine
hops
come
through
the
taste
is
mildly
roasty
up
front
and
turns
into
a
nice
hop
forward
ipa
towards
the
end
this
isnt
quite
as
bitter
as
other
black
ipa
it
seems
as
if
the
bitterness
from
the
roast
is
well
balanced
against
the
hop
profile
some
bright
citrus
notes
towards
the
end
nice
flavorful
black
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
i
think
this
is
very
successful
for
the
style
it
doesnt
seem
gimicky
as
the
roast
actually
benefits
the
hop
profile
id
drink
this
again
a
solid
black
brown
colored
ale
poured
cold
from
the
12
ounce
bottle
it
carries
a
hefty
tan
layer
of
frothy
bubbles
on
top
and
leaves
a
serious
blanket
of
lacing
the
nose
picks
up
an
abundance
of
deep
roasted
coffee
chocolate
malt
and
sea
foam
piney
hops
scrumptious
the
flavor
delivers
a
unique
seaweed
malt
and
light
coffee
with
creamy
milk
chocolate
it
has
a
slight
mineral
water
quality
mixed
in
as
well
quite
unusual
but
it
includes
a
solid
pine
bite
thats
a
tad
funky
the
body
is
medium
at
least
but
it
has
a
fairly
quiet
almost
aqueous
feel
with
a
very
delicate
gentle
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
a
more
than
solid
entry
here
pours
pitch
black
with
a
finger
length
mocha
colored
head
that
went
away
fairly
slowly
and
left
a
thin
ring
of
lacing
nice
balance
in
the
aroma
for
a
black
ipa
but
not
overpowering
at
all
get
floral
and
faint
pine
notes
from
the
hops
while
also
getting
lots
of
roasted
malts
licorice
and
some
dark
chocolate
notes
nice
balance
in
the
taste
as
well
starts
with
floral
notes
some
orange
pine
then
a
burst
of
roasted
malts
come
through
and
mix
with
the
hop
flavors
start
to
get
dark
chocolate
notes
as
well
the
finish
is
a
great
balance
of
hoppy
and
roasty
flavors
more
of
the
floral
orange
and
pine
along
with
roasted
malts
and
creamy
dark
chocolate
get
some
ashysmokey
flavors
as
well
do
get
that
belgian
flavor
from
the
malts
but
it
is
minimal
and
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
high
medium
body
with
a
really
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
somewhat
clean
on
the
finish
too
no
resinous
hop
oils
left
behind
i
thought
this
was
an
outstanding
example
of
what
a
black
ipa
should
be
definitely
hoppy
but
incorporated
with
a
hefty
dose
of
roasted
dark
malts
nicely
greenbush
continues
to
impress
o
a
pretty
solid
black
ipa
often
times
i
feel
some
of
this
are
just
too
much
like
a
hoppy
porter
or
stout
but
this
one
is
well
balanced
and
wellmade
enough
to
fit
the
style
poured

yes
it
does
starts
off
with
sweet
smooth

and
slight
citrusey

then
suddenly
smashes
headlong
into
huge
crashing
waves
of
bitter
coffee
chocolate
and
hops
finishes
wet
and
bitter
with
lingering
flavors
of

an

fans
will
not
be
disappointed
this
is
only
my
4th
beer
from
greenbush
but
thus
far
i
have
been
impressed
would
buy
again
o
i
feel
that
what
i
wrote
above
may
sound
slightly
more
critical
than
i
actually
feel
about
this
beer
as
i
believe
it
solid
however
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
in
the
black
ipa
variety
greenbush
anger
45
anger
is
one
of
the
top
american
black
ales
out
there
no
question
this
is
a
great
beer
that
straddles
two
categories
rather
nicely
i
order
this
regularly

very

bitterness
lingers
with

in

as
well
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
offering
from
greenbush
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
beers
high
c
verdict
a
nice
take
on
the
black
ipa
the
flavors
are
balanced
nicely
but
dont
really
dazzle
its
a
safe
bet
for
anyone
who
likes
hops
or
wants
to
find
a
happy
medium
between
an
ipa
and
a
stoutporter
not
my
favorite
black
ale
new
glaruss
black
top
takes
top
prize
for
that
but
those
who
like
it
on
the
hoopy
side
may
enjoy
this
one
how
appropriate
that
im
drinking
this
while
watching
an
avgn
episode
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
blackbrown
topped
by
a
solid
finger
of
soft
khaki
foam
the
nose
comprises
miscellaneous
greens
light
pine
needle
and
some
very
light
roasted
malts
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
stronger
sense
of
pine
and
a
more
robust
roastiness
providing
the
balance
so
sorely
missed
in
the
smell
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
silky
feel
overall
a
nice
little
black
ipa
nuff
said
overall
i
would
go
back
to
this
one
above
average
but
not
wow
and
fairly
priced
greenbush
you
have
my
attention
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best

had
unique

overall
this
is
a
good
black

good
balance
of
malt
and
hop
flavors
and
smooth
to
sip
on
an
enjoyable
offering
to
the
point
i
have
had
several
black
ipas
and
this
one
does
have
a
little
attitude
with
the
bitterness
compared
to
the
other
ones
if
you
like
to
have
an
ipa
with
a
little
black
lager
this
is
it
i
dont
know
why
but
i
wasnt
feeling
the
vibe
on
this
one
quite
like
everyone
else
it
was
okay
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
or
pick
up
again
unless
i
had
a
superhuge
craving
for
a
black
ipa
and
there
were
no
other
ones
available
id
take
both
shorts
black
ipas
over
this
one
bludgeon
yer
eye
and
goodnight
bodacious
i
guess
my
main
complaint
with
this
is
that
the
citrus
profile
of
the
hops
didnt
mesh
too
favorably
with
the
malt
bill
i
would
have
rather
seen
more
herbal
ashy
spicy
hops
wish
in
one
hand
i
guess
o
overall
not
wild
about
this
style
less
a
few
examples
just
had
a
shorts
double
black
ipa
goodnight
bodacious
and
feel
that
this
is
pretty
similar
except
the
shorts
had
a
bit
more
heat
and
the
hopping
on
the
shorts
was
a
bit
more
present
and
gave
the
beer
a
bit
more
character
this
one
is
not
bad
and
worth
checking
if
you
dig
the
style
but
for
me
this
was
just
pretty
good
great
beer
id
give
this
one
another
go
overall
a
great
beer
solid
has
everything
you
could
want
from
a
black
ipa
greenbush
is
coming
look
out
i
like
the
beer
but
it
didnt
blow
me
away
its
a
fun
drinking
beer
with
a
really
pleasant
flavor
its
also
an
exceptionally
goodlooking
beer
my
favorite
feature
by
far
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
and
a
good
and
unique
example
of
a
black
ipa
it
was
nicely
balanced
with
neither
the
hops
or
the
malts
being
too
overpowering
and
it
wasnt
overly
bitter
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
and
the
flavor
did
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
couldnt
see
myself
drinking
more
than
two
of
these
this
seems
like
a
nice
fall
time
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
it
was
enjoyable
and
pretty
unique
i
liked
it
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
i
dont
think
that
theres
anything
that
i
would
change
with
this
beer
its
fine
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
buy
this
bee
again
when
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
and
unique
black
ipa
and
i
think
its
priced
well
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
black
ipas
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
beer
it
did
remind
me
a
lot
of
rage
but
much
less
intense
which
made
it
much
more
enjoyable
i
thought
this
was
a
good
black
ipa
i
still
think
that
arcadias
b
craft
is
still
my
favorite
black
ipa
but
this
beer
isnt
that
far
behind
ive
been
pretty
impressed
with
these
new
greenbush
beers
it
seems
like
all
the
beers
i
have
had
from
them
havent
tasted
like
anything
i
have
had
before
and
i
really
like
that
keep
up
the
good
work
guys
o
the
charred
lack
licorice
taste
left
a
bad
aftertaste
and
a
lot
to
be
desired
i
will
not
be
having
this
again
o
this
is
my
second
offering
from
greenbush
and
never
has
a
newer
brewery
impressed
me
like
they
have
i
love
everything
theyve
done
with
this
one
the
maltiness
the
hoppyness
watch
out
for
greenbush
brewing
it
isnt
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
it
has
a
unique
taste
to
it
it
had
me
thinking
and
it
really
changes
quite
a
lot
the
more
it
warms
up
wouldnt
be
my
goto
black
ale
but
its
a
very
nice
offering
from
a
brewery
that
i
have
never
heard
of
good
going
greenbush
i
was
able
to
try
anger
from
green
bush
at
a
local
tavern
that
just
recently
opened
the
beer
poured
a
dark
nearly
opaque
amber
with
thin
slightly
offwhote
head
that
left
spotty
lacing
the
smell
included
piney
hops
and
subtle
roast
the
taste
started
just
as
most
ipas
a
nice
piney
citrus
that
was
quickly
replaced
with
roast
and
then
bittering
hops
that
helped
to
cleanse
the
pallet
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
the
beer
was
decent
but
comapred
to
the
stone
ssripa
it
was
not
as
good
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
and
again
and
again
if
i
see
it
in
the
future
half
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
jet
black
body
aroma
is
balanced
with
roasted
malts
earthy
hops
with
light
coffee
and
vanilla
flavor
is
also
fairly
well
balanced
for
the
style
with
roasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
mingling
well
throughout
with
the
earthy
and
slightly
floralgrassy
hops
medium
body
and
light
to
moderate
carbonation
so
many
of
these
arent
very
well
balanced
and
either
are
more
of
a
stout
or
an
ipa
but
the
balance
here
makes
this
a
nice
black
ipa
its
jut
not
complex
enough
to
make
it
the
best
but
still
one
to
try
while
at
the
brewery
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
not
quite
like
any
other
beer
i
have
tried
memorable
but
maybe
just
shy
of
greatness
worth
trying
if
you
come
across
it
cheers
black
ales
are
often
an
explosion
like
every
member
of
a
band
playing
their
loudest
note
at
the
same
time
anger
allows
the
individual
notes
of
a
black
ale
to
stand
out
o
its
about
a
b
not
the
best
bipa
around
o
i
want
to
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
black
ipa
that
ive
had
although
i
really
liked
stones
as
well
id
have
to
try
them
side
by
side
to
compare
if
you
prefer
a
hopsforward
profile
over
roasted
malts
in
your
black
ipas
then
youll
enjoy
anger
i
do
so
this
beer
is
solid
in
my
opinion
well
done
greenbush
o
very
solid
really
well
done
with
the
green
hops
lingering
in
the
background
while
the
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
flavors
were
upfront
nicely
done
greenbush
o
for
a
style
i
dont
normally
reach
for
greenbush
has
put
together
a
killer
aba
with
their
anger
the
hops
are
the
first
last
and
everything
in
this
beer
yet
the
dark
malt
really
adds
a
killer
complexity
to
it
recommended
o
a
nice
black
ipa
better
than
most
i
have
had
neither
the
roast
nor
the
hops
dominate
the
flavor
profile
as
it
does
on
many
others
in
the
style
cost
7
or
8
for
a
pint
o
great
beer
and
im
glad
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
really
makes
me
want
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
greenbush
brews
my
buddy
matt
clued
me
in
on
the
great
things
that
this
brewery
is
putting
out
and
hes
definitely
right
if
greenbush
isnt
on
your
radar
now
it
will
be
soon
o
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
had
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
greenbush
and
a
style
they
do
well
the
balance
between
roast
and
hop
without
overdoing
either
or
is
something
a
lot
of
brewers
could
take
a
lesson
on
fantastic
beer
o
a
really
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
and
has
great
flavors
i
really
liked
this
beer
a
lot
and
find
it
a
great
example
of
the
style
o
a
really
great
black
ipa
that
i
would
keep
drinking
over
and
over
i
knew
nothings
about
greenbush
before
drinking
this
beer
and
now
im
inclined
to
try
some
of
their
other
offerings
this
one
is
a
winner
d
a
very
enjoyable
black
ipa
and
much
better
than
almost
all
of
the
ones
available
in
the
chicago
area
im
keeping
my
fingers
crossed
that
greenbush
sends
a
few
kegs
of
this
one
our
way
as
id
love
to
revisit
it
without
having
to
make
the
long
trek
to
sawyer
my
second
experience
with
this
brewery
and
theyre
two
for
two
i
am
a
satisfied
customer
greenbush
really
impresses
me
looking
forward
to
a
labor
day
weekend
beer
stop
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation
but
loved
the
full
bodiedness
of
the
beer
hops
werent
over
the
top
like
in
other
american
black
ales
they
stuck
out
for

that
aspect
of
the
beer
rather
than
thinking
about
the
hop
bill
which
though
bitter
is
more
one
dimensional
the
most
complex
example
of
this
substyle
that
i
have
seen
deep
black
coffee
blended
wonderfully
with
sweet
chocolate
malt
in
a
smooth
brew
with
substantial
feel
piny
hops
are
just
right
in
this
equation
poured
a
deep
brown
almost
impervious
to
light
a
hint
of
light
that
sneaks
in
illuminates
a
ruby
hue
the
head
is
light
tan
and
creamy
leaving
stick
lacing
and
holding
on
well
in
to
the
beer
the
aroma
is
lighter
with
hints
of
dark
sweet
fruit
and
pine
the
taste
is
unique
but
hard
to
describe
robust
roast
malts
light
hops
hints
of
sweetness
are
all
present
the
body
has
a
nice
silkiness
to
it
with
just
a
little
bite
from
the
hops
and
a
light
amount
of
carbonation
a
unique
brew
had
this
at
the
pre
opening
of
the
new
yard
house
overall
this
was
a
surprise
ive
not
yet
embraced
the
black
ipa
style
but
this
really
opened
my
eyes
to
the
possibilities
of
this
style
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
was
a
below
average
black
ipa
with
scent
and
taste
that
were
more
malty
than
hoppy
the
body
wasnt
right
either
but
the
finish
was
smooth
so
it
wasnt
difficult
to
drink
not
worth
trying
more
than
once
o
a
solid
american
black
ale
it
does
not
really
offer
anything
new
but
it
is
doubtful
that
it
would
disappoint
fans
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
well
crafted
brew
a
nice
use
of
divergent
ingredients
to
make
a
cohesive
brew
o
this
black
ipa
has
nice
flavors
of
burnt
and
roasted
malts
but
seemed
like
it
could
have
had
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
bitterness
and
crispness
from
the
hops
not
my
cup
of
tea
this
is
a
wellbrewed
beer
but
its
the
least
enjoyable
beer
i
think
ive
had
from
shmaltz
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
nor
would
i
ever
want
to
buy
this
again
a
nice
take
on
the
style
very
drinkable
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
glass
very
dark
brownishblack
with
the
odd
reddish
glint
topped
by
a
rich
creamy
tan
head
around
an
inch
high
features
a
massive
hop
aroma
mainly
canned
mandarin
with
some
grapefruit
and
pine
along
with
charred
grain
chocolate
and
raisin
fantastic
aroma
that
contrasts
with
the
palate
not
necessarily
in
a
negative
way
this
one
favors
the
dark
malts
some
charred
grain
as
on
the
nose
dark
roast
coffee
and
dry
cacao
powder
with
the
citrus
and
tropical
hop
flavors
in
the
background
some
dark
cherry
and
peach
flavors
peeking
through
eventually
the
malts
recede
a
little
and
a
hop
spice
supplants
to
an
extent
dried
citrus
rind
and
pepper
along
with
something
quite
floral
fairly
thick
but
certainly
not
particularly
sweet
moderately
carbonated
and
with
a
bold
oily
spicy
slightly
singed
finish
that
goes
for
miles
if
you
focus
you
can
still
taste
the
orchard
fruit
in
there
amongst
the
roasted
malts
and
bitter
citruspine
more
roasted
that
some
of
the
other
black
ipas
ive
tried
of
late
but
the
bitter
spicy
hops
do
reveal
themselves
over
the
course
of
a
pint
blossoming
into
something
rather
intense
as
usual
this
brewery
wins
with
an
amusing
name
and
great
look
on
top
of
the
layers
of
flavor
this
is
just
a
really
really
good
beer
solid
effort
all
around
from
the
folks
at
schmaltz
clever
name
fun
label
delicious
beer
i
would
revisit
this
in
the
future
without
hesitation
cheers
overall
a
good
bipa
though
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
citrus
presence
in
the
bedpost
for
shmaltz
god
i
love
this
stuff
these
people
have
excellent
taste
ive
enjoyed
a
number
of
their
creations
and
i
look
forward
to
better
times
for
the
chosen
people
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
and
welcoming
to
those
who
would
rather
not
drink
a
hoppy
beer
this
is
a
must
have
and
will
hopefully
become
a
regular
in
the
hebrew
stable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
pretty
good
example
of
a
black
ipa
it
had
just
about
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
the
balance
seemed
to
be
pretty
good
with
neither
the
hops
or
malts
being
too
overpowering
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
a
little
sticky
slightly
crisp
a
little
rich
slightly
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
half
the
bottle
is
the
perfect
amount
for
me
but
i
dont
think
it
would
be
a
chore
for
me
to
drink
a
full
bottle
by
myself
and
i
think
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
on
the
cooler
days
of
spring
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
this
is
pretty
much
a
text
book
example
of
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
citrus
hop
aspect
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
didnt
stick
out
more
in
the
taste
i
think
that
held
this
beer
back
just
a
little
i
would
probably
buy
another
bottle
of
this
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
get
more
than
that
and
i
would
recommend
it
as
good
black
ipa
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
and
it
did
a
good
just
at
satisfying
my
craving
for
a
good
black
ipa
this
isnt
my
favorite
black
ipa
but
i
think
its
close
to
some
of
the
better
one
ive
had
and
so
far
its
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
tried
from
shmaltz
good
job
guys
this
was
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
keep
up
the
good
work
quite
delicious
do
love
that
smaltz
hands
down
the
best
schmalz
brew
ive
had
its
fantastic
and
a
pleasant
surprise
for
me
jet
black
in
color
really
really
dark
with
over
an
inch
of
tannish
head
frothy
and
unfading
it
has
a
nose
nowhere
near
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
and
its
got
more
pine
resin
than
bitterness
to
it
which
is
also
a
welcomed
surprise
the
malt
is
dominant
though
dark
like
a
stout
but
with
a
lightness
to
the
feel
by
both
a
softer
body
and
upbeat
carbonation
there
is
a
nice
char
coffee
bitterness
on
the
front
end
and
the
christmas
tree
type
hops
on
the
finish
with
only
moderate
bitterness
its
clean
finishing
for
its
size
i
think
the
grain
bill
is
really
awesome
on
it
7
malts
they
dont
tell
you
which
but
its
done
right
i
have
yet
to
really
be
impressed
with
anything
from
these
guys
but
this
to
me
is
an
overwhelming
success
and
one
of
the
best
black
india
pale
ales
in
recent
memory
for
me
its
super
dark
and
chalky
textured
and
its
not
over
hopped
rock
solid
overall
shmaltz
delivers
a
black
ipa
with
a
wellrounded
roasted
maltcocoa
flavour
citrus
hops
are
present
in
taste
though
would
be
nice
to
pick
it
up
more
strongly
in
the
aroma
as
well
otherwise
an
enjoyable
black
ipa
overall
a
sweet
odd

a
rich

good

a
strong
hoppy
overtone
and
subtle
notes
of
chocolate

elements
of

good
ipa
with
those
of
a
good
stout

chocolate
coffee
brown
sugar
all
make
their
appearances
on
the
palate
firm
smooth
texture
has
some
good
fizz
a
wonderful
tribute
this
is
the
perfect
ale
for
turning
a
corner
it
formally
buries
the
limitations
of
yesterday
and
signaling
a
new
step
toward
promise
dedication
and
the
impossible
well
done

rides
to
the
finish

nicely
hoppy
black
ale
that
drinks
like
a
black
ipa
hopheads
enjoy
a
thorough
enough
version
of
this
hybrid
american
style
the
blackened
malt
and
peppy
hops
playing
well
together
with
a
perhaps
gamesaving
cocoa
essence
that
has
the
good
sense
to
not
really
let
go
of
my
palate
as
always
hebrew
comes
through
and
this
time
wholly
on
their
own
terms
congrats
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
dont
need
blustering
beers
anymore
something
well
rounded
and
evenkeeled
will
do
just
fine
o
great
brew
pours
a
deep
cola
color
with
a
thick
light
beige
head
atop
that
settles
ever
so
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
dark
bread
and
earth
stand
out
in
the

mild
sweetness
going
on
here
dry
and
roasted
on
the
palateactually
very
dry
with
even
a
hint
of
smokealthough
no
big
citrusy
or
piney
hops
the
dryness
stands
out
there
is
almost
a
meatiness
to
this
beer
like
an
old
school
english
porter
wich
is
pretty
cool
but
nothing
like
alot
of
the
hoppy
black
ales
you
see
right
now
i
like
it
but
was
taken
back
by
the
flavor
profile
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
char
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
slightly
acrid
roast
and
hop
qualities
in
the
flavor
death
of
a
contract
brewer
is
a
bombastic
black
ipa
that
makes
no
apologies
for
not
only
being
a
very
bitter
beer
but
also
having
an
insanely
roasted
malt
bill
this
combo
makes
for
a
trying
beer
experience
even
beer
drinkers
that
enjoy
smoked
malts
with
a
meaty
edge
may
find
this
one
hard
to
put
down
really
a
very
drinkable
black
ipa
remarkable
deep
dark
taste
that
is
nearly
bottomless
hints
of
licorice
and
a
touch
of
incinerated
toast
plenty
of
bitterness
with
drinkability
unimpaired
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
overall
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
of
this
style
i
have
had
namely
because
it
tastes
like
a
separate
style
for
once
as
opposed
to
an
ipa
that
happens
to
be
a
different
color
id
be
more
than
happy
to
drink
this
one
again
and
again
cheers
to
schmaltz
for
no
longer
being
contracted
and
opening
their
own
facilities
well
now
i
didnt
expect
such
a
smooth
and
tasty
treat
yet
this
beer
delivers
no
question
it
combines
the
hop
nose
and
flavor
like
a
wellhopped
west
coast
ipa
with
the
tasty
smooth
maltiness
of
a
classic
english
porter
supposedly
just
a
onetime
collaboration
but
id
like
to
see
this
one
brewed
by
someone
somewhere
with
a
wide
distribution
this
probably
wont
happen
but
this
initial
experience
leave
me
wanting
more
bottom
line
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
on
the
market
available
in
variety
pack
and
22oz
both
at
good
price
points
worth
your
time
just
to
expand
your
palate
poured
into
a
hebrew
small
shaker
pint
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
brown
nearly
opaque
with
a
one
finger
tan
head
with
great
retention
and
lacing
nice
aroma
of
toasted
malt
citrus
hops
chocolate
and
coffee
lightly
piney
and
floral
a
lot
going
on
there
flavor
begins
with
medium
dark
malt
citrus
hops
citrus
rind
and
then
develops
more
intense
citrus
rind
and
grapefruit
hoppiness
finishes
with
hoppy
bitterness
and
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
char
and
pleasant
faint
coffee
and
chocolate
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
flavor
does
not
follow
up
on
the
superb
aroma
that
alternately
smells
like
a
choclate
stout
and
then
a
citrus
ipa
the
flavor
leans
more
towards
the
ipa
side
with
toasted
malt
and
chocolate
and
coffee
elements
as
suggestions
on
the
side
the
toasty
elements
are
quite
good
but
im
left
wishing
for
a
bit
more
robustness
still
a
very
nicely
made
and
balanced
ipa
style
black
ale
that
could
pass
for
an
imperial
for
the
flavor
robustness
contratulations
to
shmaltz
on
their
new
brewery
im
happy
to
drink
this
to
that
overall
just
okay
compared
to
many
of
schmaltzs
other
brews
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
black
ale
good
balance
between
the
spicy

and
roasty

very

to

a
very
enjoyable
offering
ofirst
let
me
say
what
a
goodlooking
black
ale
this
is
moving
on
this
is
a
decent
example
of
a
black
ale
with
a
good
balance
between
citrusforward
hops
and
dark
chocolatey
malt
flavors
i
could
use
more
oomph
on
the
nose
and
the
feel
was
strange
but
the
flavor
is
pretty
solid
the
hops
may
have
faded
a
bit
in
this
bottle
but
i
still
detect
a
decent
bit
of
citrus
up
front
which
provides
a
nice
contrast
the
cocoaflavored
finish
not
bad
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
smoky
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
a
bit
different
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
cola
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
hops
taste
is
citrus
hops
up
front
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
kicking
in
later
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
makes
for
a
tasty
and
quality
beer
o
not
bad
not
great
i
was
hoping
for
better
i
love
this
style
when
done
right
but
im
not
entirely
disappointed
and
am
having
no
problem
putting
down
this
bomber
overall
a
fantastic
black
ipa
impressive
considering
i
am
enjoying
this
past
the
best
by
date
the
high
abv
provides
some
warmth
but
does
not
overpower
all
of
the
components
are
balanced
very
well
people
tend
to
get
intimidated
with
the
name
double
black
ipa
however
the
black
part
of
this
beer
tones
down
the
hoppiness
allowing
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
lots
of
flavor
and
lots
of
alcohol

use
a

more
bitter
taste
as
it
leaves
a
bit
quickly
i
am
still
trying
to
get
over
the
oxymoron
of
a
black
ipa
but
here
goes
grassy
hops
light
roast
hints
of
chocolate
very
faint
spice
suggesting
anise
on
the
nose
pours
brilliant
black
to
dark
brown
under
a
3
tan
cap
it
is
very
creamy
with
an
underlying
sweetness
with
light
roast
but
no
burnt
flavors
dark
sugars
suggestive
of
light
chocolate
faint
fruit
and
spice
on
the
palate
less
hop
bitterness
than
expected
medium
body
and
a
little
more
than
medium
on
the
carbonation
not
as
hot
or
warming
as
your
would
expect
for
9
5
abv
very
drinkable
exceptional
blend
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
enjoy
any
chance
you
get
dark
heavy
flavorful
malty
alcohol
ok
a
little
strong
tasting
the
beer
poured
a
pitch
black
with
slight
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
the
light
a
and
a
slight
tan
head
that
left
sufficient
lacing
the
aroma
was
slightly
piney
but
more
resinous
and
citrus
notes
with
sweet
roasted
malt
backup
as
to
be
expected
in
a
black
ipa
the
taste
exceptionally
glided
between
dark
roasty
bitterness
and
piney
resinous
hop
bitterness
that
played
off
each
other
and
kept
my
deeply
coated
palate
guessing
as
to
where
all
the
flavors
were
coming
from
the
citrus
hop
flavors
peaked
their
head
out
from
time
to
time
as
well
and
really
accentuated
the
interplay
between
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
hop
bite
there
is
almost
a
rye
or
roasted
coffee
tone
deep
in
this
monstrous
beauty
of
a
beer
a
really
superb
black
ipa
that
manages
the
line
between
roasty
malts
and
bitter
hoppiness
with
finesse
if
you
can
say
that
about
such
a
high
abv
brew
another
great
one
from
odell
this
is
seriously
delicious
fantastic
beer
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
to
black
coloring
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
nose
of
grapefruit
smoke
roasted
coffee
pine
resin
and
subtle
chocolate
notes
flavors
are
grapefruit
forward
with
a
decent
smoke
overlay
subtle
tropical
fruit
sweetness
and
a
bitter
resinous
hops
highlight
throughout
smooth
light
bodied
with
a
smoky
roasted
and
extremely
bitter
aftertaste
the
finish
is
dry
slightly
frothy
with
a
resinous
bitter
linger
good
beer
a
beast
of
a
beer
but
so
much
good
flavor
if
theres
a
flaw
it
is
drowned
out
by
the
intensity
of
whats
going
on
this
is
like
getting
two
beers
a
roasted
barleywine
and
a
super
fresh
ipa
if
you
like
the
style
this
is
a
much
try
near
black
opaque
body
with
a
filmy
beige
head
aromas
of
pine
chocolate
roast
lovely
balance
im
not
typically
a
of
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
is
certainly
noteworthy
bitter
chocolates
and
resinous
hops
silky
mid
palate
finishing
with
some
bitter
chocolate
and
hop
notes
well
done
i
probably
should
go
buy
a
few
more
4packs
before
i
cant
find
this
on
shelves
any
longer
and
kick
myself
for
it
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
overall
i
love
the
black
ipa
black
ale
style
in
fact
possibly
my
favorite
style
this
is
a
brilliant
representation
complex
balanced
and
tasty
very
well
done
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
good
sized
brown
head
with
pretty
good
retention
definitely
resembles
a
stout
good
deal
of
lacing
smells
of
lightly
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
as
well
as
sweet
dark
fruit
and
light
citrus
hops
the
alcohol
is
definitely
there
the
taste
reveals
some
slightly
more
tamely
roasted
malts
as
compared
to
the
aroma
licorice
and
sweet
molasses
go
along
with
the
chocolate
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
harder
to
completely
pinpoint
than
i
had
expected
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
but
this
is
one
beer
that
i
would
say
could
benefit
from
even
more
bitterness
which
wouldve
complimented
in
my
opinion
some
of
the
fruit
molasses
and
overall
sweetness
incredibly
easy
to
drink
i
could
probably
down
34
of
these
in
an
hour
which
is
impressive
considering
the
abv
second
straight
time
ive
had
that
sentiment
regarding
a
beer
from
odell
overall
a
little
bit
less
than
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
balanced
taste
with
high
abv
and
drinkability
this
one
is
a
good
bet
overall
this
a
spectacular
beer
that
mixes
the
best
of
the
imperial
ipa
world
with
the
russianimperial
stout
world
extremely
dark
with
only
the
hint
of
hops
that
one
would
expect
this
is
like
a
mix
of
odells
myrcenary
with
lugenes
i
feel
like
odell
should
advertise
this
as
some
imperial
stout
ipa
as
that
is
the
best
description
i
can
think
of
the
best
food
pairing
i
can
imagine
is
some
barbecued
brisket
fantastic
beer
that
merged
my
friends
favorite
flavor
with
mine
highly
recommend
for
a
stout
lover
trying
to
get
into
ipas
appearance
near
perfect
for
me
i
enjoy
milkimperial
stouts
and
i
was
not
expecting
to
like
this
beer
the
color
is
very
dark
and
the
head
is
quite
nice
smell
notes
of
chocolate
and
milk
again
not
what
i
expected
but
i
loved
it
as
the
beer
warms
to
room
temperature
the
hoppiness
of
the
ipa
comes
to
the
forefront
tastemouthfeel
this
is
a
unique
beer
at
the
pour
the
beer
was
chilled
and
i
very
much
enjoyed
the
stouteske
characteristics
of
malt
and
body
as
the
beer
rose
in
temperature
i
both
smelled
and
tasted
more
hops
which
i
personally
did
not
care
for
as
much
my
first
sip
was
perhaps
the
best
the
flavors
all
came
at
me
in
progression
for
a
hell
of
a
ride
finishing
with
the
signature
hoppiness
of
an
ipa
that
i
expected
overall
this
beer
intrigued
me
it
strikes
me
as
a
hybrid
of
a
stout
and
an
ipa
i
will
likely
try
it
again
just
for
another
chance
to
decipher
all
that
is
going
on
in
its
taste
i
figured
that
id
finally
pull
this
out
of
my
refrigerator
and
review
it
after
a
hard
weekend
of
working
on
the
house
and
selling
some
car
parts
the
fact
that
today
we
switched
back
to
mountain
standard
time
from
daylight
savings
is
only
icing
on
the
cake
this
is
a
fantastically
complex
and
rich
beer
that
blends
the
attributes
of
two
of
my
favorite
styles
hardy
stouts
and
ipas
it
is
really
just
absolutely
delicious
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
an
evening
if
only
i
could
erase
from
my
memory
the
disaster
resulting
from
2
a
pint
old
rasputin
o
definitely
worth
trying
and
im
not
a
fan
at
all
of
black
ipas
pours
a
deep
black
with
dense
creamy
tan
head
heavy
lacing
left
behind
and
great
head
retention
nose
starts
with
some
nice
herbal
hops
along
with
some
bright
fruity
notes
this
is
paired
with
a
nice
robust
roasted
barley
note
taste
is
herbal
up
front
with
plenty
of
roasted
notes
and
piney
hop
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
black
ipa
since
they
often
seem
gimmicky
this
one
melds
the
dark
malts
nicely
with
the
hop
profile
and
makes
for
a
delicious
beer
i
dont
drink
black
ipas
very
often
but
i
always
appreciate
a
good
one
the
blend
of
light
roastiness
and
lemony
hoppiness
makes
for
an
interesting
complex
flavor
this
one
is
a
good
one
overall
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
black
ipa
the
body
of
the
beer
is
solid
and
the
hops
gives
a
well
rounded
performance
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
o
a
nice
black
ale
that
does
a
good
job
melding
the
roasted
malts
and
bitter
hops
together
the
alcohol
is
not
present
and
it
is
quite
nice
poured
into
a
maui
brewing
company
pint
glass
super
dark
almost
pure
black
smell
is
wonderful
malt
chocolate
hop
a
little
mint
as
well
taste
is
well
sip
sip
sip
you
feel
the
alcohol
more
than
you
can
taste
it
im
sure
it
could
creep
up
on
you
pretty
quick
taste
is
malty
goodness
chocolate
hop
and
more
hop
great
beer
from
a
world
class
brewery
cheers
wow
i
thought
new
glarus
black
top
had
its
self
together
as
far
as
the
blending
of
the
styles
goes
this
is
quite
a
bit
bigger
beer
but
it
is
in
perfect
harmony
between
hops
malt
alcohol
presence
and
feel
really
good
stuff
i
am
trying
this
for
the
first
time
and
it
is
5
days
before
its
best
by
date
i
know
it
is
not
that
old
but
i
do
wonder
if
i
would
like
it
as
much
fresh
with
more
of
a
hop
bite
either
way
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
get
some
for
6
50
a
4
pack
overall
this
is
a
fun
and
complex
beer
the
hops
balance
well
against
the
chocolate
maltiness
4
pk
for
11
i
generally
dont
like
stouts
theyre
too
much
of
everything
and
very
little
balance
but
mountain
standard
made
a
believer
out
of
me
its
strong
and
hella
spicy
and
then
the
alcohol
hits
you
if
a
beer
could
be
exciting
this
is
it
for
me
the
taste
will
distract
you
from
whatever
else
youre
doing
you
cant
ignore
it
othis
is
a
hopheavy
example
of
the
style
that
drinks
much
like
a
iipa
so
props
to
odell
for
truth
in
advertising
this
double
black
ipa
this
tasty
beer
that
hides
its
alcohol
well
and
provides
a
nice
balance
between
citrus
hops
and
chocolateforward
malts
a
nice
hoppy
beer
for
this
brisk
winter
evening
and
a
good
break
from
my
stout
binge
of
the
past
few
weeks
by
far
the
best
black
ipa
i
have
had
as
it
should
be
since
it
is
the
most
expensive
more
flavorful
with
the
hops
and
the
malt
over
any
other
i
have
tried
odell
brewing
does
it
again
wow
just
a
fantastic
black
ipa
that
blows
any
others
that
i
have
tried
out
of
the
water
dont
really
have
any
complaints
about
this
beer
overall
a
decent
take
on
the
black
ale
style
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
hop
presence
as
the
crazy
blend
of
floral
herbal
hops
and
earthy
roasty
malts
is
what
i
love
about
the
black
ipa
style
in
the
first
place
i
also
think
the
abv
level
on
this
one
gets
a
bit
away
from
them
imparting
more
heat
than
i
would
expect
even
of
an
imperial
version
of
the
style
trust
me
however
when
i
say
i
wont
mind
finishing
the
4pack
mouth
smooth
and
soft
heavy
and
approaching
a
syrupy
lingering
sweetness
usually
associated
with
stouts
as
i
said
up
top
i
am
a
fan
of
well
done
cascadian
darks
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
this
continues
the
trend
ive
noticed
since
moving
to
the
midwest
id
never
had
their
product
before
but
holy
shit
those
folks
at
odells
know
what
theyre
doing
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
from
an
amazing
brewery
i
dont
think
its
hyperbole
to
say
id
put
it
among
my
favourite
beers
ive
had
period
overall
i
liked
the
beer
im
unfamiliar
with
the
style
but
it
seems
a
little
more
hop
american
hops
character
would
have
made
it
great
o
4
5
nice
i
liked
this
the
first
time
i
had
it
and
i
like
it
again
now
great
beer
the
hops
definitly
dig
deep
right
from
the
start
all
the
way
to
a
pithy
finish
there
is
a
ton
of
hops
in
here
the
malts
are
thankfully
not
as
roasty
as
some
of
these
black
ipas
can
get
hops
are
lush
fruity
and
bright
also
fairly
unique
in
this
style
excellent
beverage
odell
can
make
some
damn
fine
hoppy
beers
poured
a
deep
coffee
black
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
quite
stout
like
in
appearance
but
very
nice
scents
of
peat
moss
pine
roast
malt
and
black
coffee
true
to
style
the
earthy
qualities
and
hops
shine
through
backed
by
a
nice
roast
and
black
malt
scent
very
well
done
taste
is
roast
malt
a
bit
of
alcohol
mingling
in
the
background
and
finish
an
ample
level
of
piney
hops
citrus
pith
and
grapefruit
some
very
faint
hints
of
coffee
and
sweetness
and
a
nice
earthiness
in
the
background
its
a
very
good
set
of
flavors
hoppy
yet
roasty
bitter
with
an
earthy
hint
mouthfeel
is
mediumheavy
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
some
alcohol
burn
with
an
oilyslick
finish
very
good
quite
nice
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
its
got
the
hops
its
got
the
earthiness
and
its
got
the
roastiness
to
compete
with
others
in
its
class
overall
delicious
as
a
sipper
quite
strong
though
o
great
beer
classic
colorado
brew
a
legend
overall
this
is
among
the
better
ipas
ive
had
and
probably
the
best
black
ipa
a
very
good
beer
o
another
awesome
beer
from
the
best
brewery
in
colorado
o
one
of
my
favorite
odell
seasonals
a
standout
even
with
their
stellar
line
up
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
1813
pours
an
incredibly
dark
black
with
a
light
tan
head
with
great
lacing
the
aroma
the
brown
sugar
and
coffee
clearly
the
age
on
this
beer
has
dulled
the
hop
character
of
the
dipa
but
what
remains
is
an
intriguing
beer
the
flavor
mirrors
the
aroma
lots
of
dark
roast
coffee
and
big
malty
sweetness
the
end
still
has
a
good
hop
bitterness
but
very
little
other
hop
characteristics
and
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
an
alcohol
warming
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beers
aging
ability
o
fairly
unassuming
at
first
but
the
flavours
build
along
with
the
drinkability
making
for
an
outstanding
example
of
a
style
that
i
hope
grows
in
popularity
o
a
really
impressive
highabv
cda
that
is
smooth
flavorful
and
balanced
with
hops
and
maltiness
both
making
bold
statements
a
really
impressive
beer
that
i
think
should
be
a
standardbearer
for
dare
i
say
it
imperial
american
black
ale
or
cda
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
moderate
tan
head
good
retention
and
moderate
lacing
moderate
aroma
of
citrus
and
floral
hops
with
a
hint
of
roast
flavor
is
a
nice
balancebitter
chocolate
and
toasted
grains
are
there
but
just
enough
to
contrast
with
the
nice
hop
profile
not
as
much
black
patent
bitterness
as
many
black
ipas
and
a
nice
mix
of
citrus
and
piney
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
a
clean
finish
very
nice
o
mountain
standard
is
an
outstanding
balanced
ipa
smooth
and
tasty
almost
too
much
so
for
the
9
5
abv
will
be
back
for
more
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
in
a
redorange
hue
nice
2
finger
frothy
head
the
aroma
gives
off
the
smokyness
hinting
at
the
hoppiness
to
come
the
smoky
flavor
is
a
little
overpowering
which
is
expected
from
a
black
ipa
wish
it
was
a
little
more
subtle
taste
also
hangs
out
a
bit
in
the
back
of
your
pallet
a
good
beer
nonetheless
m
goes
down
very
very
very
smooth
not
a
black
ipa
because
of
the
lack
of
hops
but
a
great
overall
beer
overall
this
is
almost
exactly
what
i
expect
a
black
ipa
to
be
sweet
and
thick
like
a
porter
with
a
very
well
balanced
hoppy
bitterness
o
grab
a
4
pack
at
any
cost
overall
this
is
what
a
black
ipa
should
be
like
beautiful
cross
between
a
porter
and
an
ipa
pours
a
dark
colabrown
with
a
fluffy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
cap
nice
and
resinous
with
the
standard
grapefruit
espresso
and
dark
chocolate
aromas
of
a
black
ipa
taste
is
similar
perhaps
a
bit
closer
to
a
hoppy
stout
then
ablack
ipa
chocolate
dark
malt
espresso
grapefruit
rind
and
resinous
hops
nice
mouthfeel
is
pretty
full
with
a
mediumfull
body
and
moderate
carbonation
pretty
decent
beer
surprised
to
see
the
abv
on
this
as
its
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
mediumlow
intensity
creating
a
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
foams
up
only
slightly
upon
the
palate
the
result
is
a
very
pleasant
sippable
beer
that
features
a
dry
close
with
mild
stickiness
lingering
along
the
palate
despite
being
able
to
taste
the
ethanol
slightly
i
feel
little
to
none
in
the
nostrils
or
across
the
palate
but
a
slight
burn
on
the
back
of
the
throat
thats
almost
negligible
the
heavy
smoothness
of
this
beer
is
excellent
get
some
and
a
fucking
awesome
bottle
by
the
way
o
chocolate
and
hops
but
very
unique
balance
and
flavor
i
like
it
o
very
enjoyable
black
ale
really
like
that
the
malty
chocolate
flavors
shine
through
really
nice
brew
well
balanced
and
super
tasty
awesome
overall
pretty
good
but
a
bit
too
much
hops
to
give
it
any
interesting
difference
from
an
ipa
overall
after
having
hop
in
the
dark
by
deschutes
i
didnt
think
id
ever
find
a
black
ipa
i
liked
more
but
mountain
standard
has
proven
me
wrong
this
is
an
absolutely
amazing
brew
for
those
who
love
hops
55
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
abas
out
there
great
roasted
notes
with
an
awesome
piney
and
resinous
hop
profile
balancing
things
out
overall
this
is
a
very
good
imperial
black
pale
ale
and
one
that
should
definitely
be
tried
by
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
the
style
i
sort
of
put
this
on
par
with
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
but
for
different
reasons
the
malt
profile
is
better
here
and
has
a
lot
of
depth
where
as
ssr
is
hoppier
wookey
jack
is
still
the
standard
but
this
is
quite
nice
indeed
odell
delivers
again
a
phenomenal
slightly
different
beer
starts
with
a
light
brown
sugar
sweetness
theres
a
toasty
flavor
as
well
slowly
the
bittering
hop
takes
over
peppery
and
spicy
warm
alcohol
in
the
swallow
long
wellbalanced
aftertaste
the
body
is
neutral
the
carbonation
high
mountain
standard
time
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
isnt
shockingly
complex
just
damn
good
i
wish
i
had
access
to
it
more
often
if
there
was
an
imperial
american
black
ale
style
this
would
be
its
captain
for
thinking
i
hated
american
black
ales
this
one
has
also
changed
my
mind
highly
recommended
and
very
nicely
flavored
my
only
complaint
is
ms
drinks
a
bit
too
much
like
a
porter
pours
a
nice
brown
cola
color
with
a
nice
beige
head
and
decent
lacing
a
bready
chocolatey
and
slightly
herby
aroma
flavor
followed
suits
started
off
malty
and
doughy
then
some
some
chocolate
and
some
herbal
and
twiggy
hops
kick
in
and
close
things
out
giving
it
some
bitterness
a
nice
full
creamy
and
active
mouthfeel
overall
fresh
of
the
tap
in
their
taproom
i
quite
enjoyed
this
one
its
probably
just
me
but
this
felt
more
like
a
brown
ipa
than
a
black
ipa
and
i
actually
enjoyed
that
id
happily
drink
this
again
overall
this
beer
is
just
so
well
done
balanced
flavor
and
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
special
beer
that
is
cheap
relatively
and
easy
to
drink
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
overall
a
solid
brew
wish
i
had
the
chance
to
try
it
fresh
but
a
few
years
has
mad
this
a
well
balanced
brew
thats
really
easy
to
drink
o
very
interesting
brew
i
was
expecting
a
black
ipa
or
a
black
anything
but
its
a
nice
medium
brown
funnily
enough
tastes
like
a
cross
between
a
black
ipa
and
a
barleywine
i
would
probably
classify
it
more
as
an
american
strong
ale
than
anything
taste
is
well
balanced
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
very
high
as
a
result
gotta
find
a
fresh
one
of
these
sometime
to
compare
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
double
black
ipa
because
i
found
it
to
be
perfectly
balanced
without
one
aspect
overpowering
it
is
too
bad
odell
does
not
distribute
to
my
state
because
this
is
one
id
seek
out
on
a
regular
basis
final
thoughts
this
is
the
first
double
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
though
the
name
may
sound
daunting
its
actually
one
of
the
more
interesting
styles
ive
tasted
pairs
very
nicely
with
a
chocolate
dessert
but
i
imagine
it
would
also
go
well
with
any
well
seasoned
steak
its
also
great
on
its
own
a
very
versatile
beer
a
and
one
of
odells
finest
overall
about
a
month
past
the
best
by
date
the
hops
have
lost
some
of
their
assertiveness
but
this
is
still
a
nice
beer
ill
have
to
try
a
fresher
example
next
time
i
am
in
odell
territory
this
one
goes
in
to
the
category
of
black
ales
ibas
that
i
actually
like
although
its
ease
of
drinking
belies
its
alcoholic
strength
have
to
put
a
stop
after
one
the
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
huge
tan
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
pine
and
resin
notes
with
some
darker
malt
thrown
in
the
flavor
is
very
similar
with
the
strong
pine
and
resin
notes
from
the
hops
really
coming
through
strong
there
is
also
some
chocolate
and
lightly
roasted
malt
as
well
as
some
cream
and
a
low
amount
of
bitterness
there
is
also
a
slight
medicinal
flavor
but
i
cant
pick
out
what
it
is
caused
by
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
love
black
dipas
and
this
is
a
very
good
one
from
odells
beer
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
medium
body
nice
pine
hops
good
finish
clean
and
nice
with
moderate
bitterness
but
no
real
roast
id
have
it
again
odell
is
there
anything
they
dont
do
well
o
well
it
is
called
a
double
black
ipa
so
i
guess
it
should
be
no
surprise
that
the
dark
roasted
malts
are
in
the
front
a
very
good
and
unique
brew
for
sure
glad
i
got
my
hands
on
this
one
thank
you
again
todd
overall
fantastic
brew
in
the
black
ipa
category
which
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
one
ranks
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
this
style
had
on
tap
at
bitter
creek
in
boise
dark
coffee
in
color
with
a
small
mocha
head
that
did
not
lace
the
glass
much
low
in
carbination
but
a
nice
hop
burst
and
with
eyes
closed
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
beer
as
an
amber
color
with
eyes
open
you
can
taste
a
little
coffee
bitterness
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
hops
are
relatively
mild
i
really
enjoyed
this
as
did
my
wife
who
is
not
much
for
hoppy
beer
body
is
medium
not
too
thin
carbonation
just
a
touch
below
medium
with
nice
life
on
the
tongue
and
a
smooth
slightly
creamy
feel
lingering
aftertaste
is
bitter
but
not
over
long
or
aggressive
the
roastiness
grapefruit
peel
and
pine
resins
dissipate
slowly
giving
you
something
to
remember
as
they
fade
the
alcohol
while
packing
a
punch
isnt
noticed
in
the
taste
much
if
at
all
very
good
double
bipa
plenty
of
hop
character
and
plenty
of
stout
character
neither
one
overwhelming
overall
i
havent
been
disappointed
with
odell
yet
and
this
is
yet
another
notch
in
their
belt
along
with
myrcenary
they
brew
2
of
my
alltime
favorite
beers
highly
recommended
overall
maybe
the
best
example
of
a
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
not
the
most
intense
beers
ever
made
just
extremely
well
crafted
o
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
recently
and
certainly
a
top
contender
for
the
odell
brews
i
bought
this
because
ive
always
been
happy
with
the
odell
stuff
and
this
certainly
has
not
let
me
down
this
is
the
first
ive
tried
double
black
ipa
and
i
hope
all
other
examples
are
equally
delicious
in
this
style
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
the
alcohol
is
well
disguised
i
never
would
have
guessed
this
has
an
abv
of
9
5
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
yet
please
go
purchase
some
you
wont
be
sorry
that
you
did
a
well
done
beer
that
shows
quality
and
depth
well
balanced
and
highlights
a
very
bright
hop
profile
while
featuring
colorado
grown
products
glad
this
is
now
available
in
12oz
overall
this
is
actually
a
solid
black
ipa
very
hoppy
the
malt
and
roast
is
minimal
so
it
doesnt
take
away
from
the
hops
i
like
it
while
i
really
couldnt
imagine
saying
a
negative
word
about
odell
this
beer
does
not
compare
to
sublimely
self
righteous
there
that
is
as
negative
as
i
can
get
what
a
lovely
deliciously
hoppy
brew
another
wonderful
job
by
our
friends
up
in
fort
collins
pours
like
the
blackest
of
coffee
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
and
indiscernible
beading
nice
lacing
this
beer
is
extremely
well
balanced
atypical
of
the
style
roasted
black
malts
are
blanketed
with
an
understated
mix
of
hops
nose
caries
through
to
the
tongue
comes
across
more
as
a
hoppy
something
darker
than
a
darker
something
hoppy
quite
tasty
though
the
feel
is
suitable
as
is
the
carbonation
overall
a
wellbalanced
cascadian
dark
ale
fantastic
brew
i
wouldve
expected
it
to
be
a
tad
bit
thicker
but
this
worked
just
fine
overall
possibly
my
favorite
beer
from
odell
so
far
they
hit
the
jackpot
with
this
one
despite
the
11
4pack
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
in
the
future
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
black
ale
very
big
and
robust
flavors
but
well
balanced
hv
overall
awesome
beer
drink
it
for
breakfast
168th
overall
a
bold
and
hoppy
black
ipa
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweetness
thus
creating
the
perfect
balance
of
flavor
in
this
exceptional
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
moderate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
of
the
style
the
juicy
fruity
hops
mixed
pretty
well
with
the
chocolaty
darker
malts
too
often
i
find
that
the
bitter
hops
clash
with
the
bitter
roastedness
of
the
dark
malts
in
this
style
of
beer
this
one
however
really
avoids
that
pretty
well
and
i
really
appreciated
that
in
it
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
beer
overall

o
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
again
very
well
balanced
and
tasty
very
good
drinkability
odell
make
some
great
beers
and
they
dont
disappoint
with
this
one
o
im
sure
glad
a
few
of
these
made
it
through
my
checked
luggage
this
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
puts
its
own
stamp
on
the
style
with
a
nice
smoky
and
woody
quality
balanced
with
a
slight
bready
sweetness
the
closest
comparison
i
can
think
of
is
new
glarus
black
topalso
a
great
offering
however
it
is
unique
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
overall
if
you
want
a
hop
forward
black
ipa
then
you
absolutely
must
try
mountain
standard
by
odell
in
fact
if
you
are
a
fan
of
ipas
in
general
you
should
give
this
one
a
shot
those
guys
at
odell
they
know
how
to
make
an
ipa
somebody
should
blind
taste
this
with
lagunitas
sucks
well
duh
ones
black
and
ones
golden
but
that
maltypiney
sharpish
flavor
seems
to
be
a
winner
these
guys
are
making
some
great
beers
and
i
have
not
stumbled
on
enough
of
them
smells
piney
and
a
bit
resinous
with
notes
of
roastiness
up
front
theres
a
dark
creaminess
almost
chocolatey
followed
right
on
the
heels
by
piney
hops
and
it
closes
with
roasted
malts
that
tie
the
taste
up
you
get
a
little
bit
of
leftover
bitterness
but
not
as
strong
as
would
usually
occur
with
an
american
dipa
this
is
a
real
nice
example
of
a
black
ipa
done
well
o
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
being
from
colorado
i
love
a
good
colorado
brew
and
this
one
is
exceptional
reminds
me
of
the
moutains
with
snow
falling
with
the
smell
of
pine
needles
permeating
even
the
cold
a
wonderful
beverage
overall
a
strong
example
of
a
black
ipa
with
really
great
balance
between
the
malt
and
hops
happy
to
have
a
chance
to
try
this
one
o
best
black
ipa
i
have
had
lots
of
porter
qualities
bittering
hops
and
an
amazingly
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
the
first
odell
beer
i
have
had
and
i
am
very
excited
to
drink
through
the
rest
of
their
line
up
mountain
standard
is
world
class
stuff
find
it
and
enjoy
it
slainte
o
a
solid
black
ipa
with
a
strong
flavor
profile
that
was
not
too
large
to
really
turnup
the
drinkability
4

odell
mountain
standard
double
black
ipa
i
am
a
fan
of
odell
products
especially
if
they
come
in
a
four
pack
the
mountain
standard
does
not
disappoint
as
the
name
implies
no
light
shines
through
this
black
brew
the
head
is
tan
and
thick
lasting
for
the
whole
experience
and
leaving
a
beautiful
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
with
lots
of
hop
complexity
the
mountain
standard
is
very
balanced
in
the
flavor
department
it
has
good
malt
flavor
but
is
not
too
sweet
or
too
big
the
hops
are
well
refined
adding
to
the
flavor
but
not
overpowering
it
in
a
time
where
brewers
push
beers
into
a
statement
category
with
big
abrasive
brews
the
mountain
standard
is
a
great
beer
that
impresses
you
rather
than
overwhelms
you
a
must
try
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
where
this
went
wrong
but
it
did
this
beer
doesnt
stack
up
with
any
other
socalled
black
ipas
ive
tried
and
perhaps
because
it
seems
quite
different
maybe
the
hop
variety
doesnt
mesh
well
with
these
malts
perhaps
it
needs
to
be
more
roastystoutlike
and
less
nutty
sweet
either
way
i
cant
recommend
it
overall
very
nice
goodtasting
brew
not
terribly
intriguing
to
think
about
while
tasting
but
not
boring
either
o
i
really
enjoy
this
one
its
right
up
there
solid
a
for
me
top
3
black
ipa
versions
i
have
tried
overall
i
am
not
in
love
with
this
but
do
really
like
it
i
really
like
having
an
ipa
in
between
stouts
and
this
one
does
it
all
in
one
beer
the
dark
roasted
flavors
and
the
bright
hop
flavors
are
all
there
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
my
current
combination
obsidian
to
insert
west
coast
ipa
light
roasted
bitterness
up
front
rich
malty
palate
with
notes
of
dark
chocolate
caramel
and
molasses
this
is
balanced
and
then
overshadowed
by
evergreen
roasted
coffee
citrus
and
scotch
tape
bitterness
interesting
mix
of
citrusevergreen
dark
fruit
and
roasted
malts
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
not
too
shabby
on
tap
at
1702
speedway
was
not
a
fan
of
black
ipa
until
i
tried
this
one
pours
dark
brown
with
a
khaki
head
lacing
that
lasts
throughout
aroma
is
a
little
piney
with
hint
of
citrus
and
some
sweetness
from
the
grains
the
taste
is
smooth
a
fairly
light
a
bit
different
than
the
nose
the
grain
is
stronger
than
the
hops
and
has
a
moderately
strong
roast
the
hop
flavor
is
mostly
in
the
finish
with
a
bitterness
that
competes
with
the
grains
and
a
light
pine
and
citrus
that
lets
it
be
smooth
a
malty
but
just
enough
bite
to
be
an
ipa
it
is
a
clean
beer
with
no
off
or
extremely
strong
stand
out
flavors
just
nice
and
mellow
throughout
for
the
strength
it
does
not
show
it
overall
a
solid
black
ipa
overall
a
very
nice
i
would
easily
place
this
as
my
favorite
black
ipa
to
date
o
overall
a
really
nice
black
ipa
al
the
roasted
characteristics
and
hops
meld
together
nicely
the
nose
is
a
little
more
hoppier
than
the
taste
which
is
in
turn
more
roasted
and
chocolatey
would
like
to
have
it
again
sometime
o
really
good
beer
just
drinking
it
knowing
it
is
pure
quality
after
mycenary
and
now
this
i
gotta
say
odell
is
on
my
radar
big
time
otop
notch
effort
wouldnt
expect
anything
else
overall
really
enjoying
this
an
extremely
unique
beer
rich
and
distinct
have
never
had
anything
like
it
man
i
really
like
this
brewery
overall
bottle
is
dated
21612a
with
a
9
5
abv
this
is
still
an
easy

really
like
everything
about
this
beer
everything
about
this
beer
gets
better
as
it
warms
give
it
time
and
your
patience
will
pay
off
o
first
of
all
this
beer
is
dangerous
has
9
5
abv
but
drinks
like
6
proceed
cautiously
its
also
supremely
drinkable
the
bitterness
is
almost
too
low
with
very
little
aftertaste
at
the
risk
of
ding
rolling
over
in
his
early
ba
grave
this
is
sessionable
o
this
beer
has
some
good
darker
notes
but
its
mostly
about
the
hops
dank
astringent
hoppy
and
good
medium
mouthfeel
that
tends
to
finish
thicker
than
it
begins
another
good
brew
from
odell
overall
this
is
a
solid
black
ale
from
odell
the
flavors
are
bold
but
not
fatigueinducing
this
along
with
the
hidden
abv
could
be
dangerous
as
i
could
easily
have
23
of
these
o
not
my
favorite
black
ipa
not
bad
by
any
means
just
wasnt
doing
much
for
me
abv
is
pretty
well
hidden
though
but
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
this
again
o
this
beer
is
like
riding
a
roller
coaster
first
its
malty
then
its
hoppy
then
its
malty
again
i
love
it
like
a
stout
and
ipa
rolled
into
one
the
9
5
abv
is
not
apparent
this
beer
is
dangerously
drinkable
another
great
brew
from
odell
pours
a
nice
deep
dark
brown
some
wispy
head
that
fades
to
a
scattering
of
clouds
on
the
surface
smells
like
roast
and
citrus
in
harmony
with
a
bit
of
pine
the
taste
is
not
a
balance
citrus
forward
with
a
bitter
backbone
that
enhances
the
bitters
in
the
roast
roast
flavor
is
mild
subdued
abd
overall
this
seems
to
disappear
from
the
palate
with
a
wink
mouth
is
right
and
this
drinks
easy
just
lacking
in
the
lasting
department
overall
a
really
balanced
black
ipa
but
imo
not
big
enough
to
boast
double
in
the
title
none
the
less
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
well
balanced
and
drinkable
strong
black
ale
it
lacks
the
complexity
and
sheer
amount
of
flavor
for
me
to
justify
it
being
a
double

theyve

been

at
choosing
their

carefully
and
this

perfect

that
showcases
that
while
the

piney

are

it

a
nice

good

that
leaves

slightly
hop
forward
taste
in
your
mouth
a
nice
choice
for
someone
looking
for
a
cross
between
a
stout
and
an
ipa
overall
really
enjoyable
with
nice
balance
o
an
interesting
beer
im
guessing
here
the
chicory
coffee
used
in
the
beer
if
there
is
is
adding
a
character
to
the
roast
and
mouth
feel
that
doesnt
make
it
very
drinkable
it
opens
up
at
warmer
temperatures
and
boarderlines
on
a
stout
which
in
my
opinion
would
have
been
a
beter
style
for
this
beer
overall
meh
overall
this
one
wasnt
my
favorite
not
bad
but
if
this
was
the
first
3f
beer
i
tasted
i
wouldnt
be
impressed
by
the
brewery
luckily
they
make
some
much
better
brews
o
good
i
like
the
orange
in
the
aroma
and
the
pineherb
blends
well
with
the
malt
flavors
overall
a
bit
too
much
rye
but
this
was
saved
by
the
wonderful
sweet
pineapple
in
the
trailing
finish
i
like
the
band
that
they
did
this
collaboration
with
an
it
is
a
super
cool
bottle
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
o
solid
enjoyableeasy
to
drink
but
i
expected
the
flavors
to
be
a
bit
bolder
that
being
said
its
still
a
fine
beer
and
one
id
easily
recommend
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
and
flavoring
while
many
black
ipasales
tend
to
overdo
it
with
the
bitterness
of
roast
and
overly
hoppy
bite
this
guy
strikes
a
tender
balance
between
the
inherent
sweetness
of
the
roasty
chocolatey
porteresque
malt
base
with
the
fruity
citric
and
floral
hoppy
balance
of
your
sweeter
eastcoast
ipa
this
makes
for
a
pleasing
highly
inviting
beer
on
all
accounts
the
ingredients
are
full
flavor
and
never
really
cheapen
giving
richness
and
robustness
throughout
this
is
one
of
the
best
most
balanced
weve
had
for
the
style
in
a
long
time
and
it
again
truly
speaks
to
the
diversity
of
the
brewery
in
drive
intensity
and
execution
malt
is
forward
and
the
best
part
of
this
brew
hops
are
mostly
bittering
on
the
finish
and
there
is
also
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
overall
a
nice
example
for
the
style
it
been
a
while
since
i
had
an
actual
hoppy
black

from
brewmane
thanks

for

this

really

very
very
drinkable
honestly
i
could
have
drink
the
entire
22
ozer
in
20
seconds
the
sad
part
about
a
beer
like
this
is
that
everyone
will
not
be
able
to
try
it
the
beer
gods
of
munster
have
struck
again
and
it
is
good
sampled
on
tap
at
the
brewery
a
deep
brown
with
some
light
passing
through
and
a
creamy
beige
head
less
hops
than
i
expected
for
fff
more
balance
the
hops
are
there
with
flavor
and
bitterness
but
theyre
offset
but
malts
with
a
nutty
and
biscuit
push
nothing
remotely
roasted
interesting
brew
oa
decent
black
ale
was
expecting
a
more
hop
forward
beer
from
fff
though
o
i
do
find
similarities
with
this
and
toxic
revolution
but
i
think
the
latter
is
a
much
more
solid
overall
beer
this
one
is
a
decent
black
ipa
but
there
are
others
id
seek
out
first
e
g
wookey
jack
glad
i
tried
this
but
not
one
id
seek
again
if
it
were
to
be
brewed
again
it
was
a
good
but
not
great
black
ale
slash
black
ipa
thanks
again
to
al
for
sending
this
one
out
the
birthday
week
is
coming
to
a
close
shortly
but
this
was
another
nice
addition
to
the
agenda
and
definitely
hits
the
spot
tonight
finishing
the
night
off
with
a
strong
black
ipa
from
the
floyds
and
its
not
toxic
revolution
shots
fired
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
blacksienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
heavy
leek
light
roasted
malts
and
some
light
pine
resin
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
luckily
the
roast
oerpowers
the
leek
character
though
not
enough
to
rid
the
world
of
it
entirely
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
drying
finish
overall
i
guess
this
couldve
been
a
nice
black
ipa
had
it
been
brewed
with
different
hops
but
the
leek
here
just
ruins
things
for
me
as
i
drink
the
lacing
is
just
gorgeous
first
impression
is
that
of
smoothness
with
a
lot
of
great
hop
flavor
without
much
of
the
bitter
crunch
possibly
due
to
me
holding
on
to
it
in
the
fridge
for
almost
a
month
sits
heavy
on
the
tongue
as
the
taste
continues
and
the
roasted
caramels
really
come
out
there
are
even
some
coffee
notes
overall
though
still
tastes
pretty
much
like
youd
expect
an
ipa
to
taste
like
just
with
a
dark
twist
that
makes
it
super
interesting
yet
still
very
satisfying
the
palate
feels
resiny
somewhat
dry
but
also
a
little
oily
pretty
good
black
ale
but
not
something
id
want
to
drink
regularly
o
a
decent
beer
certainly
not
the
greatest
but
a
different
take
on
the
style
unlike
most
other
fff
ipas
the
hops
are
subdued
in
this
beer
and
the
roastchocolate
character
overshadows
them
more
akin
to
a
hoppy
porter
pours
a
cola
brown
with
tan
head
plenty
of
head
retention
perhaps
a
bit
lighter
than
some
of
the
other
black
ipas
the
nose
is
heavy
on
citrus
hops
with
notes
of
grapefruit
and
bright
pineapple
tones
if
i
were
blindfolded
i
would
never
be
able
to
tell
that
this
ipa
is
dark
the
taste
features
the
deeper
malt
profile
that
i
expect
in
the
style
but
almost
no
roast
is
present
fruity
hops
dominate
with
some
resinous
undertones
and
mellow
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
light
with
moderate
to
high
carbonation
overall
i
dont
know
what
the
dark
malts
contribute
to
this
beer
but
it
is
tasty
nonetheless
o
this
beer
is
very
similar
to
fff
toxic
revolution
stout
which
i
drank
right
before
this
its
slightly
more
hoppy
and
less
roastymalty
with
a
thinner
body
i
prefer
toxic
revolution
to
this
by
a
small
margin
this
is
very
similar
to
firestone
wookey
jack
and
the
same
style
but
i
prefer
the
taste
of
this
and
i
swear
im
not
a
homer
rater
nor
do
i
have
a
stiffy
for
fff
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
would
not
pass
on
in
the
future
it
is
by
no
means
a
rock
star
but
something
i
would
gladly
drink
again
good
solid
beer
but
i
prefer
hop
heathen
o
well
made
with
the
right
notes
and
an
easy
drinker
at
that
was
very
excited
about
trying
this
one
being
a
fan
of
eyehategod
this
brew
here
is
an
easy
drinker
like
most
black
ipas
its
not
very
heavy
at
all
very
smooth
if
i
had
to
compare
it
to
another
three
floyds
beer
it
would
be
the
toxic
revolution
after
pouring
i
saw
that
it
was
dark
brown
in
color
with
a
burnt
brown
thin
head
tasted
kind
of
woody
to
me
kind
of
like
a
light
porter
or
something
a
well
made
black
ale
the
roast
and
pine
notes
dominate
as
expected
for
the
style
but
with
the
welcome
addition
of
some
tropical
fruits
it
drinks
smooth
and
i
had
no
problems
finishing
the
bomber
in
one
sitting
brew
poured
a
watery
black
with
a
grey
foamy
head
that
left
chunky
lacing
smells
of
dank
sticky
hops
with
solid
roasted
malts
nice
citric
notes
taste
is
big
and
bold
leading
with
roast
and
then
slamming
you
with
the
bitterish
hops
fairly
dank
and
pine
cone
but
the
roast
really
changes
the
character
of
an
ipa
the
body
is
nice
and
smooth
with
good
carbonation
things
are
really
in
balance
this
is
a
style
that
im
not
wild
about
but
if
more
of
the
black
ipas
were
like
this
id
probably
speak
differently
of
the
style
i
really
found
this
one
to
be
quite
good
this
is
a
pretty
solid
black
ipa
there
is
great
balance
and
tremendous
drinkability
the
hops
are
intense
and
the
flavor
profile
really
hits
a
good
range
i
actually
thought
the
herbal
character
meshed
best
with
the
malt
character
the
malts
were
also
prevalent
but
very
well
balanced
this
was
a
decent
black
ipa
that
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
overall
tough
to
pull
off
this
style
pine
hops
arent
the
way
to
go
but
its
a
decent
take
on
the
style
d
well
this
is
wellmade
and
to
style
its
not
really
what
i
look
for
from
a
black
ipa
the
combination
of
hop
and
roast
bitterness
gets
fatiguing
and
lacks
balancing
sweetness
alcohol
is
wellhidden
and
the
smokiness
paired
nicely
with
the
stuffed
peppers
we
made
might
order
again
as
a
change
of
pace
but
only
in
a
small
portion
size
overall
not
my
favorite
fff
beer
but
i
do
enjoy
this
style
in
general
so
this
was
up
my
alley
i
probably
will
end
up
liking
this
more
than
most
even
though
i
describe
the
hop
profile
as
subdued
i
find
it
to
be
adequate
for
the
beer
as
i
continue
to
enjoy
this
bottle
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
scent
its
almost
like
a
combination
of
alpha
king
and
topless
wytch
deep
roasted
taste
but
the
brightness
of
the
hops
come
through
the
carbonation
is
on
point
as
is
the
viscosity
this
would
be
a
better
bomber
to
share
as
i
was
done
for
the
night
after
this
one
just
because
my
mouth
was
on
flavor
overload
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
due
to
the
all
the
battling
flavors
i
would
seek
this
out
to
try
its
very
different
than
many
black
ipas
ive
had
the
roast
is
deeper
and
the
hop
character
is
distinctly
3
floyds
overall
best
black
ipa
to
date
perfect
example
of
a
solid
beer
from
the
fff
d
unexpectedly
balanced
normally
im
all
for
that
but
in
this
instance
its
balanced
because
nothing
stands
out
in
the
taste
the
aroma
was
significantly
more
complex
and
interesting
would
grab
wookey
jack
before
id
try
this
one
again
brewreport
blogspot
com
this
is
a
real
style
blur
i
am
not
that
drawn
to
it
but
its
kind
of
interesting
its
an
incredibly
bitter
beer
from
both
hops
and
char
more
floral
character
and
an
even
drier
malt
texture
could
really
propell
this
thing
into
orbit
o
roasted
malt
with
a
hoppy
background
mild
beer
o
decent
no
particular
flaws
but
nothing
outstanding
i
had
higher
hopes
for
this
beer
from
this
brewery
but
only
mildly
disappointed
o
wasnt
super
impressed
with
flavor
was
hoping
for
more
hoppiness
alcohol
comes
thru
more
than
expected
three
floyds
has
many
much
better
products
i
would
pass
on
this
brew
o
a
great
black
ipa
and
it
could
be
stellar
if
it
wasnt
so
ridiculously
bitter
still
on
par
with
wookey
jack
o
a
great
black
ipa
from
fff
that
brings
lots
of
different
hop
flavors
together
with
the
fruity
and
the
bitter
pine
grapefruit
it
is
well
balanced
between
the
two
and
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
another
great
ipa
from
fff
22oz
bottle
purchased
fresh
from
the
brewery
poured
into
a
tulip
color
is
translucent
black
with
a
finger
of
beige
head
smell
is
malty
and
boozy
with
lots
of
hoppiness
hops
dominate
the
taste
but
not
in
a
bad
way
nice
mouthfeel
once
some
of
the
carbonation
has
had
a
chance
to
settle
enjoyed
this
one
overall
another
winner
from
fff
if
you
like
their

you

abv
a
nice
change
up
from
the
usual
ipas
this
is
more
of
a
once
in
a
while
beer
for
me
thanks
to
mjmadsen21
for
sending
this
one
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
deep
brown
color
the
retention
is
thin
but
the
lacing
is
pretty
sticky
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
earthy
a
bit
roasted
and
hoppy
there
also
seems
to
be
a
slight
amount
of
spice
on
the
nose
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
lot
like
the
nose
there
is
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
there
along
with
the
subtle
spice
note
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
sharp
but
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
its
a
pretty
solid
black
ipa
not
the
best
but
i
was
really
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patches
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
has
a
better
smell
in
my
opinion
overall
falls
into
the
same
problems
that
most
black
ipas
do
the
malt
and
the
hops
just
dont
complement
each
other
well
smells
fantastic
but
its
fairly
average
after
that
o
this
was
an
okay
black
ipa
for
fff
it
was
surprisingly
lacking
in
the
hops
department
good
body
and
mouthfeel
but
a
bit
lacking
in
the
hops
department
i
was
hoping
for
more
hop
aroma
and
more
taste
it
does
have
a
nice
dry
finish
though
a
decent
black
ipa
the
appearance
is
brown
it
smells
light
alittle
carmel
and
hops
alittle
nutty
the
taste
threw
me
off
with
a
nice
fruity
nutty
mix
with
alittle
somthing
else
it
is
a
good
beer
three
floyds
hasnt
had
anything
i
didnt
like
so
far
i
dont
know
what
they
do
o
havent
had
many
black
ipas
so
not
sure
how
to
compare
to
the
style
the
lack
of
aroma
was
a
bit
unusual
considering
the
taste
profile
picked
up
a
bottle
to
try
at
a
warmer
temperature
served
very
cold
at
the
brewery
the
black
ipa
from
green
flash
is
a
good
easy
drinking
black
ipa
the
beer
poured
a
nearly
opaque
with
thick
white
head
that
left
a
very
nice
lace
the
scent
and
taste
carry
a
roast
and
pine
flare
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
overall
i
am
drinking
this
beer
about
10
days
after
the
best
by
date
so
the
hop
flavors
are
not
likely
what
the
brewer
intended
still
i
find
the
malts
here
just
a
bit
too
charred
and
when
compared
to
the
lagunitas
nighttime
i
had
just
a
few
days
ago
this
beer
comes
up
short
this
has
proven
to
be
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
this
brew
is
better
than
most
appearance
is
great
black
beer
with
thick
offwhite
creamy
head
and
lacing
the
nose
is
straight
up
hops
but
the
taste
does
have
some
malt
supporting
the
hops
oily
mouthfeel
very
good
beer
o
still
not
a
style
i
regularly
grab
for
but
this
was
a
great
attempt
roasty
with
fruity
specialty
malt
character
floral
hop
flavor
with
an
almost
buttery
toffee
backbone
the
finish
is
lightly
charred
and
fairly
bitter
citrusy
hops
accent
the
buttery
sweetness
well
its
a
bit
of
an
odd
combo
roast
overwhelms
hops
generally
not
a
huge
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
is
a
home
run
fruity
malty
hoppy
jesus
what
more
could
you
want
green
flash
black
ipa
converted
me
into
a
believer
a
wellbalanced
attack
on
the
senses
love
it
granted
its
a
sipping
beer
you
really
dont
want
to
have
more
than
one
or
well
two
o
nice
black
ipa
id
try
it
again
if
i
could
get
it
on
tap
or
get
a
fresher
bottle
regardless
its
still
really
solid
overall
this
is
one
tasty
brew
definitely
give
it
a
shot
if
you
come
across
it
onot
as
complex
on
the
nose
as
some
but
very
enjoyable
example
of
black
ipa
that
isnt
too
far
on
either
end
of
the
malthop
spectrum
would
buy
again
o
easy
drinking
basic
black
ipa
overall
a
solid
black
ipa
a
thick
tan
head
atop
a
dark
brown
and
cherry
red
brew
has
an
aroma
of
subtle
earthy
hops
that
are
superseded
by
a
wallop
of
roasted
malts
tastes
of
spent
grain
blackcurrant
caramel
and
oily
hops
medium
bodied
wellbalanced
and
smooth
but
falls
slightly
short
in
the
flavor
category
d
probably
the
least
of
my
favorite
in
the
odyssey
lineup
a
well
made
brew
no
doubt
but
i
guess
i
just
expect
better
from
green
flash
this
comes
off
a
little
uninpsired
and
a
bit
thrown
together
to
me
any
notes
of
bright
citrusy
hops
here
are
washed
out
by
the
darker
roast
there
are
much
better
offerings
of
the
style
available
i
just
wish
they
would
have
made
a
black
west
coast
ipa
seems
like
a
no
brainer
to
me
o
an
unbalanced
beer
certainly
has
its
charms
but
there
was
something
left
to
be
desired
o
a
rock
solid
black
ale
i
would
have
no
difficulty
recommending
this
beer
to
any
fan
of
hoppy
ales
light
black
in
color
and
it
will
allow
some
like
to
make
it
through
if
held
up
to
light
easily
an
inch
thick
tightly
knit
light
beige
colored
head
brussels
lacing
wonderful
aroma
of
piney
hops
and
dark
malt
the
hop
taste
actually
seems
pretty
tame
compared
to
what
im
getting
from
the
aroma
this
is
still
fairly
bitter
with
piney
hopsbut
that
dark
malt
backbone
is
very
apparent
mouth
is
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
imagined
the
flip
side
of
course
is
that
its
not
as
filling
as
a
typical
ipa
at
that
abv
deep
and
serious
bipa
makes
21a
back
in
black
which
is
not
a
bad
beer
drink
like
grape
fanta
nuanced
and
technically
superior
all
those
hops
jump
out
in
the
flavor
to
overtake
my
taste
buds
while
the
dark
sweet
licorice
malts
remain
low
but
balanced
lingering
bitterness
at
the
finish
a
good
hoppy
black
ipa
o
an
awesome
black
ipa
what
can
i
say
these
guys
know
how
to
brew
some
amazing
beer
well
done
light
to
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
for
the
style
not
much
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
but
not
as
good
as
the
best
in
the
class
overall
a
very
hoppy
and
delicious
but
somewhat
stouty
black
ipa
o
impressed
to
say
the
least
recommend
any
day
cheers
green
flash
this
is
probably
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
hopforward
and
delicious
nice
job
green
flash
overall
love
the
style
so
im
not
surprised
that
i
like
this
so
much
but
this
was
better
than
expected
a
very
balanced
and
full
flavored
black
ipa
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
but
a
nicely
lingering
bitter
pine
finish
it
really
held
up
nicely
for
several
days
in
the
growler
and
i
loved
the
combo
of
bitter
pine
and
toasty
malt
on
the
finish
a
very
solid
effort
overall
i
love
it
what
i
would
expect
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
of
hoppy
goodness
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
pores
a
pretty
much
black
body
with
one
finger
tan
head
and
left
lace
patches
the
aroma
is
mostly
piney
citric
hops
with
minor
roasted
malt
notes
in
the
background
full
bodied
and
slightly
chewy
the
hops
are
strong
and
this
beer
is
more
hoppy
than
malty
not
that
the
balance
is
totally
askew
the
roasted
malts
are
evident
and
there
is
a
slight
biscuit
feeling
along
with
sweetness
but
mostly
i
get
the
strong
hop
presence
in
this
beer
i
really
like
this
ale
as
i
prefer
black
ipas
that
are
hoppier
than
what
is
usual
of
style
anyway
this
one
pours
a
mostly
clear
dark
orange
edged
dark
brown
with
billowing
tan
colored
head
big
pillows
of
foam
clinging
to
the
glass
with

staying
for
the
remainder

pine
grapefruit
peel
dried
apricot
toffee
note
taste
sugary
into
roasty
and
caraway
notes
quickly
overtaken
by
pine
and
grapefruit
peel
its
over
quickly
nice
example
but
not
a
standout
for
me
best
by
72114
body
is
medium
but
drinkability
is
pretty
high
finish
is
smooth
roastiness
with
a
bitter
tinge
overall
its
green
flash
which
is
about
all
that
needs
to
be
said
not
a
great
black
ipa
low
hop
presence
and
overly
charred
malt
decent
enough
the
fruity
esters
from
the
yeast
are
also
bothersome
i
prefer
a
bold
citrus
hop
profile
to
stand
out
from
the
dark
malt
here
is
just
blends
and
falls
flat
see
fw
wookey
jack
deschutes
hop
in
the
dark
and
knee
deep
midnight
hoppiness
for
better
representations
overall
a
nice
black
ipa
the
citric
hop
kick
gives
this
a
west
coast
style
ipa
flavor
that
works
nicely
with
the
malts
and
coffee
aspect
smooth
balance
is
good
and
full
of
flavor
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
out
there
overall
i
love
it
what
i
would
expect
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
of
hoppy
goodness
very
enjoyable
beer
here
easy
to
drink
considering
its
bite
worth
consideration
i
would
love
to
see
this
enter
the
lineup
o
very
good
black
ipa
the
aroma
is
great
but
the
flavor
dips
down
to
more
of
just
straight
hop
flavor
which
is
disappointing
drinks
easy
a
nice
black
ipa
not
the
best
but
one
i
might
revisit
two
thumbs
up
a
black
ipa
that
i
can
enjoy
again
overall
a
tasty
black
ipa
with
some
unique
flavor
m
medium
bodied
thinner
than
expected
from
the
appearance
o
4

this
is
a
great
black
ipa
and
at
6
dollars
a
bomber
its
a
good
deal
i
wouldnt
be
suprised
if
it
has
magnum
and
simcoe
in
it
it
tastes
very
similar
to
a
black
ipa
i
homebrewed
a
while
ago
as
a
fan
of
black
ipas
and
green
flash
i
was
quite
excited
to
see
this
on
my
stores
shelves
it
pours
a
deep
black
with
a
generous
offwhite
head
that
gives
way
to
a
nice
film
but
little
lacing
the
nose
is
a
beautiful
balance
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
and
roasty
coffee
and
caramel
malt
aromas
it
sips
quite
light
and
very
clean
and
crisp
i
actually
had
hoped
this
would
have
a
little
more
body
to
it
the
flavor
while
delicious
is
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
the
hits
with
a
very
west
coast
hop
bite
lots
of
citrus
and
pine
then
comes
on
with
the
roasted
malts
the
finish
and
aftertaste
is
coffee
and
bitter
chocolate
there
is
a
nice
balance
but
i
almost
feel
it
could
use
just
a
touch
more
sweetness
it
is
definitely
one
if
the
hoppier
black
ipas
that
i
have
tried
not
my
favorite

green

is
a
top
ten
brewery
for
me
no
doubt
about
it
this
one
just
didnt
work
overall
nice
black
ale
that
i
would
certainly
have
again
but
while
the
breadth
of
flavors
is
impressive
some
others
examples
of
the

have
greater
depth

in
a

the

is
cola
brown
with
ruby
highlights
big
tan
head
forms
thick
rocky
texture
aroma
has
pungent
citrus
peel
and
dark
roasted
malt
layers
combined
into
one
goes
great
with
food
but
my
ideal
ipa
is
citrus
fruit
grassy
and
clean
the
muddled
alpha
acids
with
dark
roasts
just
dont
work
as
well
as
your
typical
ipa
without
the
dark
roasted
malts
flavors
have
the
dark
chocolate
notes
with
herbal
herbaceous
dank
weed
and
grapefruit
peel
bitterness
heavy
in
the
backend
finishes
dry
without
much
finesse
its
just
hops
and
dark
bitter
roasted
malt
without
much
poetry
between
the
two
gimme
a
porter
or
an
hoppy
ipa
in
place
of
the
hybrid
any
day
mouthfeel
is
resinous
with
hop
oils
it
even
makes
your
nares
burn
with
the
combination
overall
i
cant
wait
to
try
something
more
approachable
in
the
black
ipa
department
this
is
good
but
i
know
there
could
be
better
versions
out
there
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
and
it
really
on
delivered
for
the
aroma
and
smell
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
overall
a
pretty
solid
take
on
a
black
ipa
pretty
hop
forward
with
a
nice
juicy
and
oily
bitterness
the
dark
malt
presence
is
good
as
well
pours
black
minimal
head
on
a
medium
pour
looks
like
iced
coffee
pouring
out
aromas
of
hops
very
light
with
some
smoke
in
the
background
taste
is
very
bitter
much
more
pronounced
than
the
smell
with
a
gritty
hop
bitterness
that
is
very
piney
and
resiny
maybe
a
little
coffee
in
the
flavor
also
for
the
7
2
abv
this
is
extremely
bitter
not
a
great
brew
but
drinkable
once
to
try
i
wouldnt
purchase
this
one
again
i
suppose
some
like
this
this
but
im
not
a
fan
definitely
would
prefer
a
wookey
jack
over
this
interesting
herbal
flavor
bitter
with
leafy
hops
something
like
arugula
very
bitter
aftertaste
compromises
the
pleasure
a
lot
of
scorched
malt
flavor
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
olive
tree
market
in
ocean
beach
22oz
bottle
6
99
looks
like
a
stout
maybe
a
bit
brown
at
the
edges
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
oranges
flavor
is
exactly
the
same
with
maybe
a
touch
of
chocolate
in
there
personally
i
find
this
style
one
that
us
rarely
executed
well
and
this
is
no
exception
i
would
not
purchase
this
again
it
would
be
much
better
to
save
a
buck
and
buy
a
firestone
walker
wookey
jack
overall
this
is
a
great
take
on
a
black
ipa
and
it
is
worth
a
try
overall
one
of
the
more
solid
cdas
ive
had
glad
to
finally
do
a
proper
review
finally
glad
to
see
this
gem
in
a
bottle
unfortunately
its
not
as
complex
as
the
nose
suggests
lots
of
dry
bitterness
but
this
comes
more
from
slightly
acrid
and
roasted
dark
malt
tropicalcitrus
notes
from
the
aroma
arent
really
showing
up
on
the
palate
sticky
and
resinous
hops
with
grassy
pine
needle
followed
roasted
chocolate
malt
oatmeal
coffee
bean
and
burnt
toast
had
this
on
tap
in
arlington
va
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
minimal
carbonation
at
the
head
smells
of
pine
and
grapefruit
theres
not
much
there
in
terms
of
the
taste
you
have
the
pines
and
grapefruit
but
its
not
as
clean
and
there
is
no
hoppy
bite
on
the
back
end
overall
a
really
good
black
ipa
there
are
so
many
different
variations
on
this
style
but
green
flash
has
really
nailed
it
with
this
one
o
real
good
stuff
i
like
an
american
black
ale
like
this
with
nice
roasty
notes
and
then
big
time
hop
bitterness
for
perfection
it
could
use
more
chocolatey
malty
notes
but
overall
this
is
good
stuff
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
black
ipas
roasted
grains
and
a
sharp
hop
bitterness
really
lends
itself
nicely
on
tap
at
the
malted
barley
pours
a
dark
brownish
black
with
over
an
inch
of
frothy
tan
head
some
lacing
great
piney
aroma
with
some
roasted
malts
floral
hop
notes
and
pine
oil
the
taste
is
more
of
the
piney
hops
along
with
roasted
malts
and
some
dark
chocolate
floral
and
pine
bitterness
at
the
finish
oily
mouthfeel
bitter
chocolate
aftertaste
along
with
pine
roasty
flavor
throughout
overall
fantastic
black
ipa
that
reminds
me
of
their
west
coast
ipa
most
i
have
encountered
have
more
of
a
citrus
hop
flavor
but
this
is
a
great
piney
black
ipa
that
id
seek
out
for
sure
o
for
a
black
ipa
it
tasted
more
like
a
regular
ipa
more
than
anything
but
this
was
a
good
brew
green
flash
never
dissappoints
overall
classic
west
coast
hop
profile
its
quite
similar
in
fact
to
their
west
coast
ipa
except
with
the
addition
of
roasted
malt
and
while
id
prefer
a
stronger
roast
malt
presence
thats
not
typical
of
the
style
whats
there
is
solid
one
id
certainly
give
another
go
with
especially
if
green
flash
decides
to
bottle
this
in
the
future
o
a
solid
beer
but
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
a
black
ipa
is
the
color
and
slightly
fuller
mouthfeel
in
other
words
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
would
think
it
was
a
fullbodied
standard
ipa
o
this
beer
is
very
interesting
as
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
citrusy
and
piney
hops
combined
with
hop
bitterness
its
definitely
a
west
coast
black
ipa
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
light
beige
head
good
retention
on
a
black
body
sticky
soapy
lacing
aroma
dominated
by
piney
resinous
hops
some
faint
roast
flavor
in
the
back
but
clearly
way
hopped
taste
follows
suit
with
strong
bitterness
grassy
dominating
some
coffee
and
some
roasted
malt
flavors
but
really
hop
showcase
this
has
green
flash
written
all
over
it
and
its
awesome
scored
the
growler
at
deciccos
brewster
ny
last
weekend
and
poured
into
the
pint
glass
chilled
this
shows
a
very
dark
ruby
edges
mahogany
color
the
head
is
thick
and
light
tan
in
color
leaving
a
substantial
layer
of
lacing
the
nose
hit
is
full
of
bright
citrus
grapefruit
and
orange
with
a
twisted
pine
quality
in
there
for
good
hop
measure
just
a
vague
malt
complement
comes
through
as
well
very
nice
the
first
taste
sensation
brings
brilliant
citrus
but
blends
nicely
with
a
brown
bread
cereal
malt
the
dominating
theme
remains
the
rather
sharp
hop
flavors
but
there
is
a
clearer
note
of
some
malt
and
even
a
licorice
nuance
with
a
sort
of
minty
outcome
just
delicious
if
you
favor
hop
character
in
your
ipas
this
brew
is
easily
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
somewhat
luscious
feel
carbonation
is
a
bit
dainty
but
provides
an
effective
tingly
sensation
on
the
tongue
great
results
here
for
green
flash
pours
a
clear
super
dark
crimsonbrown
with
a
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
citrus
zest
and
slight
cocoa
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
citrus
zest
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
medium
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
more
of
an
emphasis
on
hoppy
versus
roasty
aromas
and
flavors
overall
we
would
be
hard
pressed
to
call
this
one
a
black
ipa
judging
by
the
nose
alone
you
would
be
more
apt
to
think
this
was
a
clean
stout
or
even
the
darkest
of
brown
ales
actually
its
quite
nice
the
taste
comes
across
like
the
most
bitter
coffee
stout
but
again
with
almost
no
hop
component
whatsoever
regardless
we
were
very
happy
to
find
indeeds
beers
on
tap
here
this
brewing
company
was
on
must
visit
lists
of
several
of
our
locals
but
since
we
couldnt
fit
it
in
this
worked
well
in
absentia
according
to
the
bartender
at
republic
this
was
the
only
place
in
the
city
we
could
actually
find
this
beer
on
nitro
while
we
feel
it
didnt
necessarily
do
the
beer
justice
in
the
hop
department
it
was
tasty
and
exciting
nonetheless
o
this
beer
lives
up
to
how
awesome
the
can
is
a
solid
black
ale
with
no
flaws
would
love
to
try
other
beers
from
indeed
looks
like
a
guinness
smells
like
an
ipa
malty
and
dry
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
the
beer
is
pleasant
and
not
too
heavy
i
like
this
beer
and
buy
it
occasionally
but
i
have
to
say
the
resinpiney
character
gets
to
be
a
bit
much
for
me
o
aggressively
hopped
black
ale
would
make
a
great
transition
from
summer
to
fall
a
friend
sent
this
my
way
and
im
glad
he
did
midnight
ryder
is
a
very
approachable
take
on
the
style
and
incredibly
easy
to
drink
thanks
daftpatrick
for
the
opportunity
d
this
black
ipa
drinks
more
like
an
ipa
mixed
with
a
black
ale
the
two
parts
seem
to
remain
apart
not
melding
as
much
as
one
would
like
overall
i
have
tried
many
of
the
indeed
beers
on
tap
or
in
cans
and
this
remains
one
of
my
favorites
i
love
that
perfect
mix
of
hops
and
dark
roasted
malts
and
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
and
i
have
another
winner
from
indeed
indeed
are
making
some
very
excellent
brews
this
is
a
surprising
year
round
offering
as
well
overall
a
really
good
example
of
the
style
and
worth
getting
again
i
prefer
their
pale
ale
personally
for
their
regular
beers
but
this
is
every
bit
as
good
per
style
recommendation
since
the
brewery
was
so
packed
i
couldnt
get
in
i
was
glad
to
bring
this
home
and
recommend
you
do
as
well
whoa
i
underestimated
this
beer
the
hops
and
malt
dance
in
perfect
harmony
here
try
this
beer
please
this
is
how
i
like
my
black
ales
big
bold
and
hopped
to
high
heaven
the
can
pours
a
matte
dark
brown
color
with
a
robust
inch
of
tan
head
and
leaves
glorious
ring
lacing
as
it
drinks
never
losing
its
layer
of
froth
the
nose
is
bitter
hops
and
darkly
roasted
barley
a
double
dose
of
bitter
that
transfers
well
to
the
taste
layers
of
chocolate
malt
weave
with
layers
of
piney
hops
an
enjoyable
back
and
forth
as
i
sip
clean
finishing
with
just
bitterness
left
behind
it
drinks
full
bodied
and
smooth
like
a
big
american
porter
and
is
carbonated
just
right
for
it
to
be
both
lively
and
smooth
at
the
same
time
a
very
enjoyable
beverage
my
first
from
indeed
o
a
good
beer
well
balanced
and
flavorful
doesnt
strike
me
as
hoppy
as
some
may
be
looking
for
in
the
style
but
very
good
a
nice
well
crafted
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
as
well
and
it
seems
this
brewerys
beers
are
best
consumed
fresh
to
get
to
the
core
of
their
nicely
developed
hoppy
profiles
this
one
is
a
simple
one
indeed
but
where
it
excels
it
is
very
flavorful
not
nearly
as
decadent
or
boozy
as
other
good
black
ipas
available
out
there
if
this
was
present
where
i
lived
id
definitely
get
some
again
drinkability
pretty
good
stuff
very
wellcrafted
and
flavorful
i
bet
this
can
is
on
the
older
side
so
i
wonder
what
a
fresher
edition
would
taste
like
roasted
barley
and
moderate
coffee
bitterness
up
front
some
charred
cindery
notes
piny
resinous
bitterness
increases
through
the
palate
slight
dark
fruit
malt
sweetness
midpalate
great
mix
of
roasted
malt
coffee
and
piny
hops
into
the
finish
mediumfull
body
with
a
creamy
feel
very
nicely
made
black
ipa
very
nice
offering
o
midnight
ryder
is
far
cry
from
day
tripper
which
blew
me
away
this
black
ipa
is
too
roasty
which
to
my
palate
clashes
with
the
resinous
hoppiness
i
qualify
this
review
by
saying
i
am
not
the
biggest
black
ipa
fan
overall
really
enjoyable
beer
i
really
like
the
american
black
ale
style
im
worried
that
the
six
pack
i
bought
was
not
terribly
fresh
hop
flavors
seemed
a
bit
muted
from
i
was
expecting
will
try
to
find
another
definitely
fresh
six
pack
and
revisit
my
review
at
that
time
o
this
is
unique
brew
its
more
bitter
not
hoppier
but
bitter
than
most
ipas
yet
it
has
a
nice
porterlike
smoke
to
it
all
in
all
i
enjoy
this
dont
love
it
and
cant
have
much
more
than
one
at
a
time
o
a
nice
beer
from
a
newtome
brewery
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
but
it
works
out
pretty
well
overall
pretty
darn
good
a
sixer
would
last
me
a
while
but
itd
be
a
treat
when
i
broke
one
out
more
assertive
than
your
typical
black
ale
and
does
it
well
definitely
recommended
like
licking
below
mike
piazzas
eyelid
in
a
good
way
overall
this
is
a
really
really
solid
local
beer
i
still
give
the
nod
to
new
glarus
blacktop
because
it
has
a
better
mouthfeel
and
is
much
more
balanced
than
midnight
ryder
i
did
enjoy
the
art
on
the
can
it
looks
like
teddy
roosevelt
riding
a
bear
drinking
coffee
from
a
mug
classic
some
minor
teaks
to
this
beer
and
it
would
be
world
class
better
than
average
example
for
this
beer
style
if
you
love
resinous
pine
hops
this
is
a
must
try
beer
but
i
prefer
balance
and
complexity
for
a
beer
in
this
beer
style
overall
a
great
beer
as
i
expected
i
really
like
what
i
have
had
from
indeed
plenty
of
substance
to
go
with
the
taste
o
a
solid
aba
overall
its
a
little
on
the
bittercharred
side
for
me
but
is
still
enjoyable
and
mixes
the
hop
and
roasted
malt
characters
well
the
alochol
is
hidden
behind
the
bitter
notes
very
well
finishes
cleaner
than
expected
almost
like
a
lager
than
a
ale
would
recommend
and
gladly
drink
again
thanks
for
this
one
eric
overall
im
not
the
biggest
black
ipa
fan
but
got
a
6er
to
support
this
local
brewery
midnight
ryder
is
well
made
and
pretty
tasty
even
though
its
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
day
tripper
over
this
one
o
great
tastes
fantastic
very
drinkable
for
a
solid
black
ipa
think
your
ends
of
the
spectrum
basic
hoppy
v
sweet
and
amp
up
each
end
a
dozen
times
and
you
get
this
beer
it
still
balances
each
other
but
still
very
taste
laden
and
full
of
flavor
great
example
of
the
style
something
the
community
should
strive
for
out
of
a
can
nonetheless
dispute
solved
o
third
indeed
brew
for
me
and
another
good
beer
must
get
more
next
time
im
in
mn
o
really
very
tasty
not
a
style
i
reach
out
for
very
much
anymore
but
to
me
this
is
done
to
near
perfection
on
tap
at
the
taproom
dark
brown
and
clear
with
good
looks
in
every
way
the
hops
are
fresh
indeed
smells
almost
like
hop
pellets
with
roast
lurking
in
the
background
hard
to
decipher
hop
flavor
in
the
taste
though
but
theres
ample
bitterness
and
roast
medium
mouthfeel
relatively
clean
finish
and
good
drinkability
medium
bodied
smooth
with
soft
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
very
good
beer
and
easy
drinking
overall
ok
dug
the
apa
from
these
guys
more
a
very
good
beer
black
with
generous
head
a
substantive
roast
yet
takes
an
appropriate
submissiveness
to
the
hop
story
very
smooth
drinker
with
a
roast
not
a
coffee
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
aroma
of
roast
chocolate
spruce
pine
combs
thanks
john
picked
up
a
can
at
four
firkins
tasty
reminds
me
of
the
summit
black
ipa
they
brewed
a
year
or
two
back
this
is
a
touch
more
bitter
with
a
big
dry
cocoa
and
grapefruit
finish
to
back
up
the
aroma
brings
an
herbal
citrus
hops
hit
with
dark
bread
crust
the
malts
bring
an
extradark
chocolate
flavor
that
ties
into
the
bitter
citrus
hops
with
a
slight
burnt
edge
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
go
find
yourself
a
can
m
medium
bodied
leading
to
full
with
the
malt
good
carbonation
this
has
that
great
combination
of
dark
roast
and
hops
light
body
and
dark
flavor
very
nice
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
its
simultaneously
light
dark
rich
and
hoppy
the
bitter
characters
of
the
dark
roasted
malts
and
the
hops
blend
together
really
nicely
and
the
aromatic
hops
lighten
things
up
really
tasty
an
impressive
first
brew
from
indeed
looking
forward
to
trying
more
of
their
stuff
overall
a
very
nice
black
ale
d
crushed
a
can
no
problem
and
would
happily
have
another
not
quite
as
easydrinking
as
day
tripper
but
a
really
excellent
take
on
a
style
i
dont
always
enjoy
if
you
like
black
ipas
id
highly
recommend
checking
this
one
out
overall
a
very
good
black
ale
big
hops
and
bitterness
but
it
manages
to
be
fairly
balanced
with
a
pretty
good
dark
roast
presence
very
nicely
done
o
this
baby
is
beautiful
i
have
high
hopes
for
this
brewery
now
two
beers
that
are
awesome
this
this
one
being
world
class
keep
an
eye
out
for
indeed
brewing
because
they
are
gonna
be
doing
big
things
overall
this
beer
was
awesome
and
i
went
in
with
no
idea
what
to
expect
definitely
get
this
if
you
can
haha
can
punny
o
pretty
good
but
room
for
improvement
to
me
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
a
awesome
beer
ive
been
sampling
some
local
stuff
all
day
for
darkness
eve
and
this
takes
it
so
far
if
the
rest
of
this
new
breweries
portfolio
is
as
impressive
as
this
beer
they
are
going
to
be
a
very
big
thing
now
i
just
wish
their
beer
did
not
sell
out
so
fast
so
i
could
try
day
tripper
will
buy
again
a
pleasant
surprise
overall
and
combined
with
day
tripper
quite
a
start
for
a
young
brewery
overall
other
than
some
of
the
insane
imperial
ones
this
nails
the
american
black
ale
style
better
than
anything
i
have
had
between
this
and
day
tripper
indeed
is
the
most
promising
new
brewery
i
have
tried
in
years
i
really
want
to
see
what
they
do
next
overall
a
delicious
beer
its
an
amazingly
drinkable
beer
considering
the
rich
taste
hats
off
to
the
brewer
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
2012
abr
from
notes
pour
was
black
but
not
viscous
kicking
up
a
half
finger
of
tan
foam
the
nose
and
flavor
were
very
roasty
and
the
taste
smokey
underlying
this
was
citric
and
resin
hop
flavor
coffee
and
bittersweet
chocolate
mildly
bitter
medium
body
the
smoke
tended
to
overpower
the
flavors
in
the
samples
we
tried
at
the
festival
will
try
it
again
at
some
point
no
doubt
to
reiterate
tasty
stuff
i
like
it
rewarding
satisfying
and
one
to
return
to
again
and
again
with
many
pleasures
to
return
on
each
new
trip
ill
be
doing
this
one
again
and
again
at
the
indeed
tap
room
solid
black
dark
khaki
head
and
fair
lacing
smell
of
chocolate
coffee
light
roasted
malts
and
light
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
more
of
the
dark
than
the
hops
but
still
tasty
coffee
and
chocolate
go
all
the
way
into
the
finish
and
aftertaste
the
citrus
hops
are
more
underlying
silky
smooth
feel
with
a
medium
full
body
overall
a
terrific
example
of
the
style
cant
wait
for
this
to
come
out
in
cans
as
i
will
drink
it
pretty
regularly
only
the
second
black
ale
or
whatever
youd
call
it
that
id
drink
again
this
is
an
excellent
brew
if
its
any
indication
of
whats
going
to
be
flowing
out
of
indeed
ill
be
back
bock
yeah
final
thoughts
great
beer
from
a
new
brewery
a
flagship
american
black
ale
is
just
what
this
pale
ale
ipa
and
wheat
beer
saturated
market
needs
will
be
buying
this
when
its
available
at
in
liquor
stores
on
cask
at
town
hall
tap
this
beer
arrives
a
black
color
the
head
is
one
inch
of
dense
tan
foam
that
doesnt
really
recede
but
leaves
a
nice
coating
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
the
aroma
is
quite
malty
with
a
ton
of
roasted
malt
some
chocolate
hints
of
maple
syrup
and
grapefruity
hops
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
leans
toward
the
maltier
side
for
an
american
black
ale
but
the
hops
are
still
an
integral
component
of
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
silky
texture
and
soft
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
the
second
flagship
of
this
newest
of
minneapolis
breweries
this
beer
was
enjoyed
both
in
its
natural
form
but
also
on
cask
with
two
versions
one
dry
hopped
with
ctz
and
another
with
cascade
lighter
than
most
american
black
ales
this
beer
strives
for
balance
and
drinkability
rather
than
heavily
roasted
or
bracing
citrus
hop
flavors
black
in
color
but
not
deep
with
brownish
edges
and
a
beige
cap
of
foam
above
average
so
much
left
to
be
desired
from
my
first
new
holland
brew
nice
22
ounce
bottle
into
signature
pint
glass
2014
bottling
pours
fairly
crystal
clear
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
2
finger
dense
and
rocky
khaki
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lasts
dense
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
moderate
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
retaining
the
head
aromas
of
big
grapefruit
lemon
zest
orange
peel
pine
floral
grass
dark
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
dark
bread
light
char
and
floralroasted
earthiness
very
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
complexity
of
citruspine
hops
and
darkroasted
malt
notes
with
good
strength
taste
of
big
grapefruit
lemon
zest
orange
peel
pine
floral
grass
dark
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
dark
bread
light
char
and
floralroasted
earthiness
good
amount
of
pineroasted
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
grapefruit
lemon
zest
orange
peel
pine
floral
grass
dark
chocolate
cocoa
coffee
dark
bread
light
char
and
floralroasted
earthiness
on
the
finish
for
a
while
damn
nice
complexity
and
balance
of
citruspine
hops
and
darkroasted
malt
flavors
with
a
nice
crisp
bitternesssweetness
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
smooth
crisp
and
fairly
creamysticky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
black
ipa
all
around
great
complexity
and
balance
of
citruspine
hops
and
darkroasted
malt
flavors
and
very
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
an
ok
sweet
fruity
black
ipa
overall
a
very
drinkable
black
ipa
although
beer
advocate
recommends
a
lower
serving
temp
of
40f
the
beer
is
more
tasty
at
higher
temps
the
fruit
sweetness
and
chocolate
are
more
prominent
this
beer
nicely
separates
the
hop
aroma
and
the
malt
flavors
yet
balances
everything
out
to
make
for
an
enjoyable
beverage
the
hops
shine
in
the
aroma
primarily
and
the
malts
make
for
a
rich
and
tasty
dark
grain
treat
sure
theres
some
overlap
with
these
things
and
thats
where
the
subtle
balance
comes
through
easy
drinking
dark
ale
to
the
point
if
you
are
looking
for
bold
citrus
keep
looking
nice
aromatic
hops
with
a
solid
robust
style
from
the
roasted
grains
when
the
roasted
grains
and
the
aromatic
hops
work
together
black
ipas
are
pretty
good
they
are
still
not
a
favorite
in
my
book
but
i
am
liking
them
more
and
more
when
i
get
a
good
one
and
this
is
a
very
good
black
ipa
pours
a
deep
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
aroma
is
lightly
roasty
a
bit
nutty
with
a
string
citrus
presence
flavor
has
some
dark
chocolate
notes
that
add
intrigue
theres
a
bit
of
phenolic
character
at
the
finish
fairly
characterful
brew
the
hops
dont
clash
with
the
malt
overall
a
good
example
of
a
black
ipa
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
tried
of
this
style
o
an
incredibly
approachable
easygoing
american
black
ale
it
is
more
simplistic
and
straightforward
than
many
other
examples
of
the
style
but
this
actually
works
in
its
favor
more
balanced
and
with
a
better
integration
of
flavors
than
many
ales
of
this
style
i
recommend
this
one
highly
to
fans
of
hoppy
dark
ales
o
rye
hatter
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
one
when
my
wife
asked
me
how
it
was
i
paused
for
a
minute
and
finally
answered
its
confused
ill
stick
with
rye
black
hatter
is
a
dark
beer
pointed
in
bright
citrus
fruits
carob
dried
provence
herbs
and
minty
flavours
hopheads
will
rejoice
so
gloriously
luscious
and
indeed
they
should
especially
at
4
99bomber
that
said
it
does
lack
the
rich
mocha
notes
and
muscularity
of
the
styles
best
examples
which
makes
it
a
somewhat
incomplete
example
still
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
edit
after
warming
a
little
more
spiciness
comes
out
in
the
taste
upgraded
slightly
o
a
milder
gentler
better
balanced
black
ipa
without
the
clashing
flavors
of
some
others
i
could
not
see
myself
hanging
around
on
july
4th
drinking
these
all
day
i
could
see
drinking
one
or
two
would
buy
again
good
carbonation
level
intense
citrus
hop
aroma
is
very
inviting
and
leaves
me
wanting
for
more
intense
hop
taste
and
mild
carbonation
tickles
the
tongue
fading
into
dark
malt
flavor
not
a
ton
of
roasted
malt
flavor
but
enough
for
me
viscous
mouthfeel
excellent
okay
black
ipa
very
forgettable
nothing
id
seek
out
o
i
think
this
is
slightly
better
than
the
overall
average
here
on
ba
especially
considering
the
price
trying
the
black
hatter
and
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
another
fine
creation
by
holland
the
beer
pours
a
almost
opaque
black
with
teh
deep
ruby
hugh
the
head
is
at
least
a
finger
thick
and
is
leaving
a
lace
the
smell
has
very
fine
hoppy
with
pine
leaning
tones
there
is
not
much
in
the
form
of
roast
or
malt
the
taste
is
a
bit
bitter
than
i
would
prefer
from
a
black
ipa
would
like
a
bit
more
roast
and
malt
to
start
and
then
let
the
hops
clean
the
pallete
the
beer
has
a
light
to
moderate
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
isnt
bad
but
definitely
not
the
best
i
like
the
flavor
with
the
lower
abv
which
makes
this
a
potential
session
brew
o
this
was
a
different
take
on
ipa
the
darker
malt
did
not
provide
a
strong
enough
backbone
to
support
the
hops
it
lacked
the
sweetness
necessary
for
balance
and
the
hops
flavors
were
one
dimensional
and
almost
harsh
overall
it
was
okay
but
not
something
i
would
go
very
far
out
of
my
way
to
find
o
very
nice
and
a
good
cda
will
buy
again
especially
since
its
only
4
50
for
a
bomber
id
order
another
for
the
price
this
is
great
i
will
buy
a
few
more
smooth
tasting
but
a
little
flat
also
finishes
semi
dry
and
semi
bitter
a
solid
offering
from
the
boys
at
new
holland
o
overall
a
decent
cascadian
ale
flavor
was
decent
but
felt
it
fell
just
a
bit
short
of
being
a
solid
good
4
0
rating
with
a
linear
complexity
and
lacked
that
spike
or
stand
out
quality
end
of
the
day
a
good
example
respectable
worthy
of
a
try
overall
a
rather
nice
roasty
and
chocolaty
flavor
with
some
nice
hoppy
accents
while
not
the
greatest
black
ipa
it
is
rather
tasty
im
a
big
fan
of
new
hollands
the
poet
stout
but
havent
been
that
impressed
anytime
ive
tried
their
mad
hatter
ipa
i
view
this
beer
as
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
one
i
would
purchase
again
this
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
some
blood
red
around
the
edges
the
beer
has
a
hop
dominant
nose
there
is
an
impressive
amount
of
citrus
notes
as
well
as
a
heap
of
pine
needles
the
flavor
is
also
all
about
the
hops
the
pine
and
citrus
come
through
full
force
there
is
not
a
ton
that
would
give
away
the
black
part
of
the
beer
other
then
the
appearance
the
roasted
malts
and
other
dark
flavors
arent
too
strong
however
this
beer
drinks
really
well
and
is
a
worthy
version
of
the
original
not
a
stand
out
in
this
growing
style
but
not
bad
either
at
5
its
not
a
bad
value
either
o
might
be
my
favorite
of
the
hatter
variants
pretty
decent
this
is
my
first
foray
into
black
ales
but
i
will
definitely
heed
the
other
reviews
and
look
at
others
in
the
genre
the
feel
is
good
about
a
medium
body
with
a
brightness
to
it
that
seems
to
contradict
its
thick
dark
look
crispness
never
fades
and
its
smooth
underneath
a
good
black
ale
this
above
par
for
new
holland
one
i
would
reccomend
dark
pour
inch
head
great
lacing
smells
like
an
ipa
tastes
like
an
ale
with
a
bit
of
slightly
smoky
malt
with
a
decent
amount
of
hops
roasted
malt
is
prominent
in
this
blend
and
works
well
adding
balance
to
this
beer
unique
and
very
drinkable
if
you
get
a
chance
to
pick
this
one
up
go
for
it
one
of
my
favorites
from
new
holland
bottle
pours
deep
black
with
a
big
off
white
head
some
ruby
coming
through
the
light
on
the
edges
smells
of
pine
hops
and
lots
of
roasty
malts
very
nice
flavor
is
hop
forward
with
lots
of
pine
some
earthiness
and
then
a
good
bit
of
roast
creamy
finish
on
this
one
and
rather
pleasant
medium
bodied
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
actually
pretty
decent
pours
opaque
black
with
a
two
and
half
finger
offwhite
head
the
aroma
of
pine
citrus
rind
and
roasted
malt
although
a
bit
more
understated
rises
from
the
glass
pine
and
citrus
rind
dominate
the
opening
of
this
brew
which
transitions
to
a
mild
dark
chocolate
roastiness
and
then
finishes
dry
with
citruslike
bitterness
and
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
adequate
carbonation
lightermedium
bodied
brew
ive
had
black
ipas
i
liked
more
but
ive
also
had
some
i
didnt
like
as
much
a
solid
tasty
brew
the
beer
is
pleasurable
enough
to
drink
but
the
problem
is
that
the
beer
has
a
tough
time
competing
with
the
black
ipa
of
southern
tier
stone
or
rockers
o
pretty
good
but
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
stone
or
deschutes
takes
on
the
style
i
actually
prefer
regular
mad
hatter
over
this
version
worth
a
try
i
guess
but
not
a
beer
id
drink
often
o
a
decent
beer
drinkable
with
a
manageable
amount
of
hops
overall
this
is
a
tasty
black
ipa
id
definitely
buy
it
again
medium
bodied
average
carbonation
and
has
a
ruby
red
grapefruit
aftertaste
a
good
black
ipa
american
black
ale
which
i
recommend
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
not
bad
but
not
great
nothing
really
stands
out
its
smooth
and
drinkable
but
ultimately
forgettable
not
my
favorite
aba
very
overwhelming
the
malt
bill
needs
to
be
more
in
your
face
poured
into
a
pints
glass
the
beer
was
a
thin
black
giving
a
distinct
hoppy
aroma
on
the
intial
taste
my
first
thought
was
green
olives
these
are
good
on
a
pizza
but
bad
in
a
beer
this
was
accompanied
by
the
sensation
of
a
strong
licorice
taste
for
an
ipa
the
hops
were
rather
mild
if
it
did
not
say
ipa
on
the
bottle
i
might
not
have
guessed
the
style
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
making
the
experience
end
quickly
this
was
help
along
by
the
blast
of
carbonation
which
probably
caused
the
bottle
to
foam
over
in
the
first
place
obviously
this
was
not
a
well
balanced
beer
appears
black
from
a
distance
but
up
close
you
notice
quite
a
bit
of
light
coming
through
revealing
more
of
a
cola
color
forms
a
moderate
sized
light
tan
head
colored
head
some
mild
lacing
aroma
is
roasted
malts
and
citrus
but
the
combination
doesnt
work
so
well
resulting
in
a
slightly
metallic
note
the
taste
is
similar
with
some
lightly
roasted
malts
grapefruit
and
a
mild
acidic
quality
that
seems
very
out
of
place
not
a
whole
lot
of
hops
or
roasted
malts
or
coffee
for
that
matter
medium
bodied
appropriate
carbonation
mild
bitterness
250th
review
o
a
pretty
good
black
ale
but
not
something
i
would
get
again
pours
black
bodied
with
thick
beige
soapy
head
that
leaves
38
of
an
inch
retained
head
pleasant
cascadian
citrus
aromas
and
inviting
creamy
mouthfeel
spot
on
the
style
good
drinkability
roast
some
citrus
and
decent
hop
bitterness
thanks
for
bringing
back
chris
crisp
and
resiny
palate
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
flavor
and
worth
trying
again
and
sharing
o
so
hard
to
put
into
words
the
flavors
arent
necessarily
the
best
but
they
somehow
complement
each
other
surprisingly
well
the
orangemalt
combo
with
the
pop
of
mint
has
a
dessertlike
quality
more
importantly
since
its
so
complex
i
just
kept
going
back
for
more
because
i
felt
it
was
impossible
that
a
beer
tasted
like
that
on
the
previous
sip
whackadoo
i
have
liked
the
hatter
series
but
much
like
the
rye
this
comes
up
quite
short
when
compared
to
the
oak
aged
which
is
by
far
superior
and
the
top
of
the
group
o
decent
interesting
brew
it
was
4
for
a
22oz
in
chicago
but
id
like
to
try
it
on
tap
at
new
holland
to
see
what
its
like
drinkable
for
a
glass
but
dont
have
2
o
im
glad
i
tried
this
on
i
tend
to
like
dark
beers
and
ipas
and
this
one
did
a
really
good
job
combining
the
two
overall
very
pleasant
beer
surprised
to
catch
notes
of
mint
in
the
nose
not
a
common
beer
smell
not
an
unpleasant
one
though
silklike
texture
with
low
carbonation
made
this
black
ipa
surprisingly
smooth
deep
reddish
brown
body
good
garnet
highlights
when
held
up
to
bring
light
no
visible
carbonation
12
finger
light
tan
head
slow
dissipation
with
good
retention
minimal
lacing
nose
is
err
off
to
say
the
least
latex
band
aids
significant
dose
of
roasted
malt
hops
negligible
in
the
nose
taste
is
fairly
roasty
hard
to
get
by
the
aroma
but
theres
a
pronounced
lack
of
cascadia
hops
the
label
mentions
centennial
but
having
a
hard
time
detecting
much
else
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
much
effervescence
it
was
hard
to
try
and
enjoy
this
after
the
strange
aroma
profile
pass
a
decent
black
ipa
although
not
as
good
as
others
ive
had
before
like
the
thornbridge
raven
black
also
a
decent
ipa
offering
by
new
holland
though
not
as
good
as
its
oakaged
sibling
if
youre
looking
to
complete
the
mad
hatter
series
definitely
give
it
a
try
otherwise
i
personally
find
it
to
be
a
rather
forgettable
entry
in
the
black
ipa
market
the
taste
was
appealing
after
moving
furniture
most
of
the
day
i
was
very
thirsty
the
first
impression
is
of
the
dark
roasted
malt
then
the
hops
came
through
its
tasty
and
overall
a
good
brew
i
good
ipa
but
its
definitely
somewhat
of
a
disconnected
american
black
ale
pretty
good
medium
bodied
with
a
good
balance
of
dry
bitter
earthy
hops
and
deep
roasted
malt
theres
a
blast
of
bitter
earthy
hops
up
front
with
hints
of
soil
and
pine
which
is
countered
by
some
sweet
citrus
the
citrus
character
isnt
as
strong
as
the
nose
suggests
with
faint
hints
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
the
dryness
from
the
hops
is
complimented
by
the
deep
roasted
malt
flavor
hints
of
coffee
bean
dark
chocolate
burnt
toast
and
licorice
overall
this
was
okay
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
decent
balance
but
the
hop
profile
is
one
dimensional
and
the
malt
presence
is
a
bit
heavy
for
my
liking
loved
the
rye
but
missed
me
on
the
black
ale
overall
this
is
a
really
good
low
alcohol
black
ipa
lots
of
flavor
and
feel
not
over
the
top
but
very
solid
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
they
were
completely
dashed
this
isnt
anything
like
what
i
want
from
a
good
cda
or
black
ale
or
what
have
you
im
far
less
inclined
to
try
the
others
in
the
hatter
series
i
drainpoured
half
the
bottle
d
this
was
a
very
nice
black
ipa
with
perfect
balance
of
mostly
hops
complemented
by
dark
malts
it
had
good
body
too
with
no
alcohol
noticeable
so
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
style
recommended
o
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ale
these
hatter
variations
have
been
pretty
nice
my
favorites
in
this
style
category
tend
to
be
above
7
abv
excluding
rj
rockers
black
perle
which
i
didnt
love
and
this
one
doesnt
buck
that
trend
new
holland
beers
are
usually
nothing
less
than
excellent
but
this
one
although
not
a
total
loss
is
something
i
have
no
interest
in
buying
again
enjoyed
this
more
than
the
oak
barrel
hatter
a
fine
beer
pretty
drinkable
but
seems
to
be
missing
something
i
would
call
this
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
fairly
priced
beer
as
well
although
i
wont
reach
for
this
one
again
personally
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
hints
of
coffee
chocolate
and
sweet
oatmeal
in
the
taste
pine
like
hops
and
small
presence
of
coffee
although
a
bit
watery
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
pine
hop
in
the
aftertaste
more
a
porter
small
hops
just
about
average
with
the
low
abv
as
it
is
this
is
one
of
those
sessionable
beers
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
badly
by
my
book
i
searched
and
searched
in
vain
for
the
metallic
aftertaste
so
many
other
bas
have
described
but
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
bomber
one
hopes
that
perhaps
they
may
have
finetuned
out
some
kind
of
problem
that
used
to
exist
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
next
time
i
am
in
a
black
ipa
mood
overall
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
this
hatter
variation
the
flavors
didnt
mesh
well
and
the
aftertaste
is
foul
o
after
i
got
past
the
initial
bad
impression
of
off
flavors
this
opens
up
to
be
a
pretty
nice
beer
id
certainly
buy
this
again
overall
a
very
nice
balanced
aba
not
too
roasty
roast
malt
and
hop
bitterness
pair
nicely
overall
it
was
a
good
beer
not
great
but
solid
love
the
bitterness
and
roastiness
combination
but
not
a
fan
of
the
metallic
aftertaste
and
the
lackluster
aroma
o
a
nice
try
on
a
new
style
of
mad
hatter
for
new
holland
i
think
they
went
a
little
too
safe
and
it
shows
as
this
is
not
more
than
a
average
beer
the
abv
is
light
making
it
drinkable
for
many
pints
over
but
i
would
just
stick
to
one
and
then
go
onto
something
else
notes
another
nice
offering
in
the
hatter
series
with
this
pricequality
ratio
i
would
not
mind
picking
it
up
again
when
it
hits
the
shelves
fresh
o
nicely
done
pick
this
one
up
if
you
havent
checked
it
out
yet
its
worth
it
overall
not
very
impressed
with
this
its
too
bitter
lacks
flavor
and
too
thin
and
mild
black
ipas
are
getting
popular
now
i
hope
new
holland
reworks
this
brew
not
something
i
want
again
pours
black
with
some
reddish
edges
with
cinnamon
head
that
leaves
lacing
aroma
of
wet
grass
lemon
roast
toast
and
slight
cinnamon
tastes
of
wet
grass
earth
vegetation
lemon
roast
toast
cinnamon
sticks
burnt
bread
toward
the
finish
and
then
goes
clean
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
flavors
are
aggressive
and
unbalanced
an
attack
of
malt
vs
hops
with
no
cohesion
i
am
a
big
fan
of
the
original
mad
hatter
ipa
and
this
one
is
a
nice
variety
on
it
would
like
to
have
it
again
soon
o
this
is
a
good
well
made
easy
to
like
beer
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
100x
better
then
the
oaked
mad
hatter
and
is
a
solid
low
abv
aba
only
5
5
i
liked
this
one
im
a
fan
of
new
hollands
regular
mad
hatter
ipa
and
this
was
a
great
variation
of
it
the
citruspine
of
the
ordinary
hatter
shone
through
very
well
the
roastymalty
notes
came
afterwards
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
coffee
and
then
back
to
the
citruspine
and
bitterness
o
not
my
favourite
black
ale
drinkable
if
you
can
get
past
the
bitter
herbs
but
i
wont
be
having
another
i
might
dry
one
out
of
the
bottle
o
like
the
lower
alcohol
enough
of
the
black
element
to
make
it
complex
would
love
to
see
it
in
6
packs
and
it
was
5
bucks
a
bomber
o
i
am
very
happy
with
this
beer
if
it
was
sold
in
6
pack
i
would
go
to
it
on
occasion
i
wish
more
breweries
would
produce
more
normal
strength
versions
of
this
style
good
change
of
pace
d
its
time
to
put
the
whole
black
ipa
fad
to
rest
if
your
going
to
do
it
do
it
well
or
skip
it
overall
this
was
a
disappointing
brew
i
really
enjoy
black
ipas
but
this
one
was
below
par
i
followed
this
brew
up
with
a
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
and
the
stone
beer
was
far
superior
drinkability
a
very
impressive
brew
from
new
holland
brewing
a
good
style
of
beer
too
dvery
very
drinkable
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
little
twist
to
their
ipa
drinkabilitythis
is
a
very
interesting
beer
with
subtle
qualities
had
this
charm
on
tap
at
reverends
and
i
must
say
besides
the
imperial
hatter
this
is
probably
the
best
of
the
series
a
very
malty
black
hatter
a
truly
rare
beer
that
should
probably
be
bottled
sometime
not
very
hoppy
but
still
a
verry
good
brew
on
tap
at
brewpup
july
2007
poured
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
miniscule
tan
head
aroma
is
of
roasted
malts
with
some
herbal
hop
notes
medium
bodied
with
a
roasted
chocolate
malt
flavor
backed
with
some
citrus
and
floral
hop
notes
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
a
solid
beer
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
and
easy
tweak
for
them
to
use
their
ipa
recipe
and
throw
in
alternative
specialty
grains
i
inquired
whether
they
considered
it
a
porter
or
stout
and
the
reply
was
that
its
their
ipa
with
dark
grains
id
have
to
agree
with
the
first
reviewer
that
its
most
like
an
american
stout
but
not
as
complex
or
rich
pours
a
dark
brown
murky
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
slightly
roasty
aroma
combines
with
a
floral
piney
hop
aroma
seems
like
a
cross
between
an
ipa
and
a
porter
there
are
some
roasty
flavors
combining
with
some
sweetness
and
floral
hoppy
flavors
bitterness
seems
to
work
well
with
the
light
roasty
flavors
maybe
a
bit
thin
but
carbonation
seemed
right
a
very
interesting
think
here
hard
to
classify
but
certainly
worth
looking
at
big
thanks
to
bas
macallister
and
pixel
for
sharing
this
with
me
a
smokey
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
quality
hints
of
caramel
help
balance
the
rough
edges
of
the
chewy
hops
the
beer
drinks
more
like
a
hopped
up
porter
than
an
american
stout
the
rough
tannins
of
the
hops
do
hurt
the
mouthfeel
somewhat
deep
mohagany
pour
with
black
in
the
middle
medium
but
durable
tan
head
atop
smells
really
roasty
and
sweet
with
a
nice
hop
twinge
in
there
as
well
roasted
chocolate
flavor
with
some
herbal
qualities
i
really
liked
it
tasted
similar
but
wasnt
quite
as
enjoyable
this
still
was
quite
good
stronger
roasted
flavors
almost
smoky
at
times
but
they
are
tempered
by
the
piney
flavor
of
the
hops
i
always
thought
hatter
would
be
solid
with
a
more
stouty
profile
and
i
was
right
give
it
a
try
if
youre
at
the
pub
o
delicious
unique
brew
with
lots
to
love
on
unique
style
unto
its
own
beatiful
tasteful
great
name
great
bottle
great
company
would
go
well
with
hot
wings
o
id
prefer
tangerine
mango
fresh
orange
pineapple
papaya
passionfruit
tropical
fruit
etc
mixed
with
the
roasty
flavors
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
id
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
like
the
black
ale
style
pours
black
with
a
thick
and
creamy
off
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
has
lots
of
pine
and
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
and
the
grain
bill
offers
burned
caramel
and
milk
chocolate
theres
toffee
and
roasty
notes
too
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
with
pine
trees
and
caramel
and
chocolate
theres
a
huge
resiny
bitterness
that
lingers
long
into
the
finish
silky
and
creamy
body
with
a
noticable
hot
alcohol
that
could
be
hidden
a
lot
more
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
not
really
impressed
though
o
great
interplay
from
both
malt
and
hops
and
a
modest
complexity
offered
by
both
this
beer
boasts
a
very
unique
flavor
profile
i
also
would
never
have
guessed
that
this
fella
clocked
in
at
8
7
abv
a
solid
american
black
ale
watch
out
for
its
abv
though
cant
quite
tell
from
my
tasting
notes
the
yakima
glory
poured
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
a
full
tan
head
and
loads
of
hops
on
the
nose
below
the
hops
there
was
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
that
subdued
the
hoppy
aroma
the
taste
was
a
front
load
of
big
juicy
hops
that
faded
into
a
bitter
burnt
chocolate
and
sweet
toasted
malts
the
two
flavors
played
well
with
each
other
and
brought
out
the
shining
attributes
of
each
while
not
allowing
the
other
to
take
over
there
was
loads
of
flavor
and
lots
of
dynamic
tastes
to
be
had
a
delicious
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
to
spare
medium
body
strong
effervescence
up
front
drying
from
the
start
a
really
nice
beer
overall

excellent
tasting
beer
but
there
are
some
problems
here
and
there
with
this
beers
overall
presentation
however
regardless
of
some
cosmetic
issues
ahem
this
is
a
fine
brew
actually
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
northern
brewers
black
ipa
homebrew
recipe
that
i
brewed
once
big
malty
middle
and
lots
of
excellent
hop
blending
makes
me
wonder
who
influenced
who
long
story
short
i
recommend
this
beer
on
its
taste
alone
overall
it
was
okay
i
didnt
enjoy
it
much
but
thats
my
dumbass
fault
for
buying
a
beer
that
pays
tribute
to
a
place
that
produces
a
lot
of
hops
when
i
dont
like
ym
beers
to
be
supper
hoppy
poured
into
becker
pint
glass
dark
brown
with
a
big
fluffy
tan
head
that
leaves
tons
of
lacing
as
it
dissipates
about
halfway
to
sit
as
a
thick
disc
of
foam
smell
is
a
nice
mix
of
fruity
and
piney
hops
and
dark
chocolate
malts
taste
is
absolutely
delicious
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
creamy
and
full
with
chocolate
dark
malts
moving
seamlessly
into
juicy
fruity
hops
it
finishes
sweet
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
and
sticky
awesome
o
second
time
having
this
beer
this
isnt
much
of
a
summer
beer
but
i
remember
sipping
this
during
christmas
eve
one
year
and
thats
when
craft
beer
became
a
passion
instead
of
a
hobby
not
to
sure
that
this
beer
tops
by
10
but
this
beer
will
always
be
remembers
because
of
how
it
turned
me
into
craft
beer
taste
starts
with
suprising
but
welcome
citric
hops
didnt
get
much
smell
of
these
which
are
quickly
overtaken
by
roasty
malts
with
bitterness
chocolate
and
tobacco
has
a
bitter
roasty
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
with
moderate
carbonation
for
a
black
ipa
is
a
surprising
first
sip
big
hops
not
overwhelmingly
bitter
or
stingingly
astringent
necessarily
but
spicy
and
fruity
you
know
its
victory
immediately
afterward
as
it
starts
to
warm
up
you
get
a
malty
backbone
strong
enough
to
hang
those
juicy
hops
on
theyre
almost
bitter
orange
linger
on
the
exit
its
just
the
slightest

o
not
too
bad
still
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
american
black
ales
but
this
seems
like
a
nice
go
to
pours
bubbly
amberbrown
with
foamy
khaki
head
aroma
of
slight
cinnamon
cola
grass
evergreen
big
and
tasty
cinnamon
cola
and
then
hop
presence
soaks
thru
evergreen
mint
mild
lemon
grassy
but
without
the
hop
bite
booze
is
detected
toward
the
finish
but
in
no
way
a
nuisance
medium
bodied
with
light
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
boozy
delight
im
assuming
this
beer
is
really
fresh
which
is
why
i
am
tasting
all
hops
and
very
little
in
the
way
of
roasted
malts
tastes
more
like
a
regular
ipa
right
now
does
a
good
job
of
hiding
the
alcohol
though
solid
brew
but
not
really
my
style
so
i
dont
know
if
i
would
drink
it
again
saw
this
as
a
single
on
the
shelf
and
remembered
how
much
i
liked
it
last
year
very
hoppy
but
nice
dark
color
bitter
and
sweet
but
not
syrupy
velvet
texture
on
palate
slight
sourness
not
much
head
good
alcohol
percentage
though
reminds
me
a
bit
of
dfh
indian
brown
just
a
bit
more
hops
bottle
poured
a
clear
black
color
ale
with
a
average
size
foamy
head
with
good
carbonation
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
dry
roasted
malt
with
light
resin
and
piney
notes
is
satisfying
taste
is
more
focused
on
dry
roasted
malt
then
hops
though
some
resin
and
piney
notes
still
comes
trough
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
not
sure
if
i
had
an
old
bottle
or
what
but
this
is
below
the
standard
of
the
style
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
best
by
nov
2012
this
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
small
tan
head
which
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
lacing
the
smells
are
of
pine
hops
coffee
molasses
and
caramel
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
pretty
great
lots
of
spicy
black
pepper
some
dark
malts
a
little
more
spice
and
it
finishes
with
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
alcohol
burn
dang
good
stuff
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
one
i
am
on
a
black
aleipa
quest
right
now
and
believe
that
stone
15th
anniversary
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
category
this
one
is
much
lighter
but
still
dark
roasted
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
if
you
are
into
this
style
you
must
try
this
one
if
youre
into
very
hoppy
brews
this
is
one
for
you
personally
id
like
something
with
a
touch
more
malt
balance
but
its
still
damn
good
the
rest
another
winner
from
victory
great
malt
flavor
and
no
hint
of
almost
9
alcohol
a
decent
piney
earthy
black
ale
even
though
this
isnt
anywhere
close
to
black
in
color
overall
not
black
certainly
not
pale
but
sure
is
good

does

oa
delicious
ale
with

flavor
o
this
is
a

beer
i

how
it
suprises
you
with
a
very
easy
and
settle
taste
12
oz

poured
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
deep
amber
with
adequate
head
and
lacing
citrusy
hop
aroma
taste
is
a
little
light
for
the
american
black
ale
style
but
a
very
nice
citrus
hop
blend
and
slightly
dark
malt
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
not
true
to
the
style
but
as
a
crossover
between
straight
ipa
and
black
ale
im
digging
it
overall
great
beer
one
of
the
few
seasonals
i
pick
up
a
full
case
of
great
balance
and
mix
of
hops
and
malt
poured
into
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
one
inch
tan
head
that
sticks
around
awhile
and
then
settles
into
a
film
of
bubbles
plenty
of
lacing
smell
is
pine
grapefruit
hints
dark
chocolate
and
some
grass
the
taste
is
all
of
that
but
much
more
intense
some
strong
coffee
notes
and
boy
is
this
a
hoppy
beast
body
is
perfect
neither
thick
or
thin
and
that
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
lots
of
life
and
on
the
dry
side
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
great
price
and
you
know
how
old
it
is
this
beauty
is
17
days
old
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
this
on
drinks
like
it
wants
you
to
consume
mass
quantities
but
the
abv
should
be
remembered
as
it
is
very
well
hidden
o
pretty
hoppy
and
bitter
i
would
say
this
is
more
of
a
darker
not
black
ipa
for
sure
the
higher
alcohol
percentage
gives
a
subtle
warming
feeling
after
you
swallow
and
wait
a
little
bit
i
could
myself
see
enjoying
this
on
a
chilly
day
again
even
though
the
beer
didnt
stand
out
to
me
too
much
overall
i
dont
think
this
is
really
a
black
ipa
at
all
drinks
more
like
a
strong
ale
with
some
english
influences
lots
of
toffee
and
caramel
malt
with
punishing
bitterness
very
interesting
and
unique
beer
which
is
worth
trying
strikes
me
as
more
of
an
imperial
red
than
an
aba
but
its
bloody
tasty
regardless
the
choice
and
proportions
of
malt
and
hops
demonstrate
a
brewer
who
knows
their
shit
some
things
were
nice
about
this
beer
but
some
things
werent
as
well
pours
out
a
dark
brown
hue
with
a
thin
tan
head
that
leaves
some
decent
retention
and
a
beautiful
ring
of
lacing
around
the
beer
the
smell
is
a
nice
combination
of
chocolate
malts
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
starts
out
with
some
hops
followed
by
some
chocolate
malts
and
than
more
hops
attack
the
palate
followed
by
some
sweet
malts
and
the
finish
leaves
some
hops
on
the
tongue
a
very
complex
hoppy
beer
that
has
a
nice
smooth
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
that
leaves
you
dry
and
wanting
more
with
a
beer
this
good
all
i
can
say
is
victory
brewing
is
living
up
to
its
name
the
taste
is
slightly
roasted
malt
with
piney
hop
backing
in
the
swallow
there
is
a
slight
citrus
edge
not
quite
what
i
would
call
grapefruit
in
the
middle
with
the
resinous
element
bringing
out
more
spice
with
slight
sweet
nutty
tinge
from
the
malt
with
subtle
dark
toast
and
mild
alcohol
in
the
taste
there
is
more
heat
in
the
finish
with
sharpness
from
the
hops
lingering
overall
i
feel
this
is
good
but
it
straddles
the
fence
between
a
hoppy
imperial
brown
and
the
black
ipa
which
doesnt
fit
to
me
there
is
a
lot
of
roasted
character
which
seems
to
cover
some
of
the
hops
but
overall
a
nice
american
strong
ale
a
really
solid
ale
and
my
type
of
dark
hoppy
ale
lots
of
flavour
with
great
hop
character
this
beer
pours
a
dark
carameled
amber
color
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
caramel
aroma
fresh
piney
hops
taste
of
toasted
bread
honey
and
caramel
piney
hops
in
generous
quantities
mellows
out
and
gets
a
bit
smoother
as
the
temperature
rises
medium
mouthfeel
and
quite
a
good
drink
overall
o
i
am
not
a
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
pretty
decent
wouldnt
buy
it
again
as
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
one
you
should
give
a
shot
if
you
like
blackbrown
ales
overall
taste
was
a
slight
let
down
from
such
a
beautiful
appearance
and
aroma
but
in
no
way
is
this
a
bad
beer
just
not
an
excellent
one
a
deep
ruby
color
with
a
thin
layer
of
khaki
bubbles
drifting
about
the
top
smells
of
caramel
plum
toasted
malt
and
floral
hops
tastes
of
buttery
toasted
malt
dark
fruit
and
burnt
rice
leaves
an
odd
aftertaste
that
just
doesnt
quite
add
up
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
wet
but
the
odd
flavor
left
behind
takes
away
from
an
otherwise
good
beer
not
one
id
be
opposed
to
having
again
but
not
one
ill
seek
out
either
overall
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
have
enjoyed
other
brews
of
this
style
much
more
clown
shoes
hoppy
feet
comes
to
mind
o
probably
the
most
drinkable
dark
ipas
ive
had
to
date
falling
slightly
behind
sublimely
self
righteous
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
any
fans
of
the
style
d
im
glad
i
decided
to
give
this
a
go
this
was
my
first
black
ale
excellent
balance
with
many
delicious
flavors
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
the
drinkability
is
superb
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
will
be
trying
again
in
the
future
overall
a
nice
blend
of
hoppy
and
roasted
grains
slightly
sweet
hides
the
8
7
abv
quite
well
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
i
like
how
the
sweet
malts
offset
the
bitter
grapefruit
i
took
my
time
sipping
on
this
beer
and
as
i
did
she
really
opened
up
the
taste
was
on
the
hoppy
side
at
first
but
really
balanced
out
once
it
warmed
up
will
buy
again
ontap
at

it
pours
a
deep
dark
mahoganyamber
hue
with

head
and
sheets
of

not
black
per
se
it
is
more
akin

has

dankness
and
is

sits
upon
an
englishstyle
malt
i
e
biscuity
buttery
and
unobtrusive
and
the
whole
thing
reminds
me
again
of
a
topshelf
sn
offering
some
tea
like
bitterness
is
observed
after
a
while
too
the
feel
is
fairly
creamy
for
a
beer
in
the
ipa
family
i
like
overall
a
very
good
black
ipa
cda
ablka
one
of
my
favs
of
the
fledgling
style
i
had
this
first
when
it
was
still
called
yakima
twilight
and
i
have
enjoyed
it
since
it
is
much
less
burnt
than
some
other
examples
of
the
style
but
i
can
deal
with
this
the
flavor
profile
works
and
its
allaround
tasty
serving
type
bottle
enjoyable
beer
that
got
better
as
it
sat
bought
a
six
pack
and
am
looking
to
age
the
others
so
im
hoping
they
age
well
victory
yakima
glory
ale
is
a
highly
sparkling
dark
brownish
red
ale
with
a
thick
creamy
light
brown
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
hoppy
roasty
aroma
with
notes
of
citrus
peel
caramel
and
coffee
its
medium
bodied
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
very
dry
finish
it
tastes
dry
and
well
bittered
with
citrus
peel
and
pine
resin
theres
a
healthy
dose
of
dark
roast
the
malt
is
sturdy
and
has
a
toffeelike
quality
all
of
the
flavors
are
in
balance
and
they
work
well
together
great
job
victory
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
which
reminds
me
of
a
mix
between
a
black
ipa
and
a
barleywine
i
cant
say
ive
had
too
many
like
it
victory
makes
some
good
brews
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
much
darker
than
expected
amber
color
the
head
was
pretty
big
here
and
needed
some
time
to
settle
down
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
very
hoppy
plenty
of
citrus
and
pine
on
the
nose
the
taste
gives
off
some
deep
caramel
sweetness
upfront
and
a
great
floral
citrus
bite
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
had
some
decent
body
to
it
and
a
good
carbonation
overall
this
beer
was
really
good
i
thought
and
would
be
willing
to
drink
this
one
again
sometime
this
beer
delivers
in
every
way
a
victory
for
victory
this
beer
has
worked
its
way
into
my
top
5
beers
i
go
to
victory
brewpub
quite
frequently
and
cant
help
but
order
the
same
beer
yakima
glory
a
nice
use
of
hops
providing
a
nice
scent
and
taste
i
rarely
see
it
on
tap
anywhere
outside
of
the
brewpub
but
definitely
gobble
it
up
if
you
find
it
hopheads
should
look
for
this
one
i
didnt
have
any
idea
what
kind
of
beer
this
was
when
i
bought
it
so
i
was
a
little
surprised
when
it
came
out
so
dark
the
head
is
thick
and
sticky
and
the
body
is
a
perfectly
clear
dark
mahogany
aroma
of
roasted
malts
and
piney
hops
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
flavor
of
dark
roasted
and
toasty
malts
countered
by
a
grapefruit
rind
bitterness
delicious
i
will
be
looking
to
get
more
of
this
one
o
a
great
example
of
a
cascadian
dark
ale
from
all
the
way
in
pensylvania
its
all
in
the
execution
and
this
one
does
very
well
very
drinkable
despite
the
8
abv
cheers
o
probably
the
hoppiest
dark
ipa
ive
had
lots
of
interesting
tastes
going
on
between
the
darker
malts
and
the
hop
bitterness
id
happily
revisit
this
one
o
a
decent
brew
id
have
another
one
o
a
decent
brew
id
have
another
one
overall
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
a
complex
and
tasty
beer
i
liked
the
dark
warm
fruity
qualities
of
this
black
ale
versus
others
in
the
style
the
bitter
and
boozy
flavors
increased
as
the
brew
warmed
which
i
didnt
love
but
others
might
super
offering
i
wish
i
could
get
this
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
true
hops
heads
may
think
it
holds
back
on
the
hops
i
like
the
balance
delivered
here
d
with
8
7
abv
i
dont
expect
to
have
more
than
1
or
two
but
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
another
fine
beer
from
victory
i
hope
to
sample
a
hop
wallop
next
d
good
but
a
tad
boozy
and
darknot
hoppy
id
order
another
but
i
wont
buy
a
sixer
of
this
one
drinkability
at
this
abv
yakima
glory
a
one
a
night
beer
for
me
but
its
a
nicely
complex
beer
that
ive
enjoyed
sipping
i
wont
hesitate
to
treat
myself
to
this
one
again
my
over
all
impression
is
that
this
is
a
well
made
beer
that
works
quite
well
as
a
cask
offering
for
me
much
of
the
difference
between
this
one
on
cask
and
the
bottled
or
tap
versions
lies
basically
in
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
even
though
i
thought
the
tap
version
to
be
smooth
and
creamy
this
one
tops
it
for
creamy
smoothness
didnt
quite
understand
this
style
the
first
time
round
so
lets
see
how
one
o
the
first
cdas
ive
tried
appears
now
it
pours
a
clear
garnetrusset
topped
by
a
finger
of
dirty
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
toffee
light
cocoa
powder
grapefruit
peel
light
pine
and
mint
the
taste
leans
heavier
on
the
hops
primarily
with
notes
of
orange
peel
grapefruit
rind
and
pine
an
undercurrent
of
toasted
caramel
flows
nicely
though
definitely
hindered
by
the
hops
things
clash
a
bit
here
with
balance
a
lost
afterthought
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
smooth
feel
overall
a
decent
cda
but
the
flavor
clash
really
makes
this
thing
hard
to
drink
with
a
smile
overall
as
the
trend
of
black
ipas
has
really
taken
hold
in
the
us
yakima
glory
tends
to
get
lumped
in
with
them
though
its
not
at
all
black
and
not
quite
as
roasty
as
its
newfound
brothers
still
a
good
option
for
the
hopheads
looking
for
something
different
although
well
lets
be
honest
with
so
many
on
the
market
nowadays
these
dark
ipas
are
becoming
rather
commonplace
overall
ok
for
the
style
i
like
this
style
a
lot
and
this
one
is
more
hop
forward
and
less
roasty
i
like
a
bit
more
balance
as
i
generally
like
this
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
one
i
would
go
for
again
given
all
the
better
alternatives
in
the
style
na
zdravje
highly
recommended
the
booziness
is
completely
hidden
i
could
see
having
a
few
and
taking
a
nice
nap
very
dry
malty
mouthful
it
tastes
like
sweet
yellow
grapefruit
but
then
very
bitter
on
the
back
end
this
beer
tastes
best
when
it
is
cold
because
the
high
abv
8
7
starts
to
present
itself
when
on
the
warm
side
in
fact
i
didnt
even
know
it
was
that
high
in
abv
until
i
looked
on
ba
victory
is
slowly
becoming
one
of
my
staple
beers
for
cost
and
quality
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
well
the
roastiness
and
the
flavoring
hops
blended
together
for
some
reason
we
were
expecting
this
one
to
be
overwhelmingly
hoppy
which
could
have
possibly
clashed
with
the
otherwise
darker
aspects
of
the
brew
when
evaluating
these
mixed
styles
it
can
be
easy
to
have
one
component
outweigh
another
but
this
brew
sees
a
nice
balance
through
to
the
end
with
some
admittedly
robust
flavorings
this
is
a
pretty
well
designed
beer
i
laud
victory
for
being
bold
in
their
delivery
but
the
flavors
arent
integrated
well
in
my
opinion
im
finding
that
the
burnt
sourness
on
the
end
is
overpowering
any
sort
of
hop
bitterness
that
i
should
be
tasting
cool
beer
but
im
not
gonna
finish
a
sixer
by
myself
an
average
example
of
the
style
but
with
so
many
better
versions
out
there
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
this
stuff
really
surprised
me
the
first
time
i
had
it
like
most
other
victory
beers
its
a
winner
this
batch
seems
a
little
different
from
past
years
but
still
really
solid
wicked
foamy
head
when
poured
smell
is
of
hops
and
malt
with
an
earthiness
the
taste
is
not
overpowering
with
the
hops
theres
a
toasted
sweet
malty
flavor
that
backs
it
up
damn
i
really
love
this
beer
its
different
from
everything
else
ive
had
and
i
dig
that
o
good
pours
a
unique
two
and
half
finger
of
creamy
yellow
head
deep
brown
color
smells
of
sweet
malts
carmel
toffee
sweet
alcohol
earthy
hops
piney
and
some
floral
dated
best
by
nov
2011
tastes
quite
nice
big
carmel
sweetness
toffee
chocolate
powder
earthy
and
more
earth
pine
dark
fruity
notes
some
roasted
malts
medium
bodied
medium
carbing
a
strong
lingering
pine
and
earthy
bitterness
some
dryness
but
not
too
much
overall
this
is
good
the
price
hurts
it
overall
at
2
75
a
single
overall
pretty
good
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
light
ipa
like
beer
with
a
name
like
yakima
glory
but
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
otherwise
a
bit
syrupy
and
sweet
and
sticky
but
pretty
good
bitter
plenty
of
hops
too
o
very
happy
with
this
beer
i
actually
had
it
on
tap
prior
to
this
review
and
did
not
enjoy
it
perhaps
it
was
due
to
poor
tap
line
maintenance
storage
or
the
multiple
beers
i
had
prior
anyway
im
much
more
pleased
with
the
bottle
presentation
a
complex
blend
of
hoppiness
and
dark
malts
without
trying
to
overpower
the
drinker
with
west
coast
hops
very
strong
from
start
to
finish
if
your
pallet
appreciates
hoppiness
seek
this
brew
out
i
beleive
its
seasonal
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
rich
carbonation
is
moderate
and
the
elements
work
together
to
offer
a
balance
of
crispness
and
smoothness
that
wont
blow
anyone
away
but
certainly
makes
each
sip
pleasant
the
body
is
medium
fitting
for
the
overall
character
if
not
quite
in
line
with
the
typical
aba
its
smell
has
hops
roasted
malt
and
some
lemon
as
well
for
the
citrus
aspect
yg
hits
you
with
malts
then
coffee
hops
a
bitter
finish
this
leans
toward
full
bodied
with
the
right
balance
yg
is
a
nice
beer
and
another
solid
offering
from
victory
this
one
poured
a
very
dark
amberbrown
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
an
decent
lacing
on
it
the
smell
is
pretty
heavy
with
alcohol
not
all
that
pleasant
taste
is
heavy
caramel
malt
with
some
alcohol
taste
coming
through
not
bad
but
could
be
better
i
think
medium
mouthfeel
not
too
smooth
though
ok
beer
but
not
great
id
try
it
again
but
wont
search
it
out
overall
ultimately
didnt
like
it
nearly
as
much
as
i
expected
to
based
solely
on
its
appearance
and
aroma
more
complicated
than
some
black
ales
or
black
ipas
which
seem
like
conventional
hoppy
beers
with
dark
food
coloring
added
here
the
dark
malts
add
character
and
complexity
but
in
doing
so
detracts
from
the
hops
this
pours
very
dark
purple
with
medium
tan
head
there
is
moderate
retention
and
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
pungent
dark
fruits
and
hops
the
flavor
is
robust
raison
and
citrus
hops
i
like
this
because
the
complexity
relies
on
fruit
rather
than
spice
im
most
impressed
with
the
amount
of
detectable
hops
and
bitterness
in
the
taste
and
the
lack
over
oversweet
syrup
qualities
that
sometimes
come
with
abvs
over
8
the
body
is
heavy
but
well
balance
so
12
of
these
would
be
pretty
painless
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
reasonably
drinkable
but
rather
unremarkable
beer
some
hops
some
malt
decent
balance
but
just
not
all
that
much
to
it
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
if
i
had
known
it
was
a
seasonal
i
would
have
bought
more
vey
tasty
im
glad
i
bought
this
as
a
sixes
rather
than
a
solo
bottle
im
looking
forward
to
enjoying
this
smooth
slightly
sweet
and
totally
tasty
ale
overall
what
i
found
in
yakima
glory
was
immense
drinkability
theres
a
lot
of
character
there
but
its
not
overdone
and
what
is
there
is
really
quite
polished
its
superbly
balanced
the
alcohol
might
be
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
having
another
but
to
be
honest
i
didnt
really
find
it
anywhere
sure
you
know
its
there
and
you
can
feel
it
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
but
it
never
really
shows
nicely
done
interesting
that
this
is
characterized
as
a
black
ale
not
sure
what
id
call
it
but
am
not
sure
black
ale
is
it
in
any
case
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
id
get
it
again
but
i
prefer
the
hops
to
be
a
bit
more
assertive
in
a
beer
like
this
all
in
all
a
decent
fairly
complex
brew
color
is
a
nice
deep
amber
almost
red
with
a
halfinch
white
head
that
lingers
for
some
time
crystal
clear
balanced
smell
of
malt
and
hops
with
some
citrus
and
dried
fruit
as
well
with
closed
eyes
could
almost
mistake
it
for
a
double
ipa
but
the
malts
give
it
away
hoppy
but
not
too
bitter
and
extremely
well
balanced
the
malts
lead
off
and
the
hops
closes
im
still
working
on
evaluating
mouthfeel
in
general
so
unless
i
feel
something
unusual
the
rating
will
be
a
4
this
is
a
nice
winter
to
summer
transition
beer
pairs
well
with
a
good
cheddar
another
good
showing
from
victory
a
really
good
brew
victorys
take
on
arrogant
bastard
but
in
a
more
drinkable
more
balanced
presentation
i
would
buy
this
again
despite
the
hefty
price
tag
not
a
black
ipa
as
the
video
on
the
web
site
would
have
you
believe
too
bitter
and
not
enough
dark
roast
character
for
that
style
recommended
its
not
a
porter
its
not
an
ipa
and
i
wouldnt
even
really
say
its
a
hybrid
of
the
two
styles
but
it
has
some
similar
elements
probably
most
similar
in
style
to
hibernation
from
great
divide
or
maybe
a
lessintense
arogent
bastard
high
praise
indeed
as
those
are
two
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
d
very
good
not
my
favorite
black
ipa
but
an
excellent
example
one
i
will
revisit
frequently
overall
a
very
nice
dark
ipa
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
letting
the
hops
really
come
through
would
definitely
drink
again
pours
a
ruby
red
mahogany
brown
wait
a
minute
id
give
it
higher
points
for
appearance
but
its
not
black
then
again
it
doesnt
say
anything
on
the
bottle
about
it
being
a
black
ale
sure
does
smell
like
one
though
smells
earthy
and
of
citrus
a
little
woody
crisp
hop
bite
with
a
very
complex
finish
several
flavors
pass
through
the
pallet
before
ending
im
getting
a
little
coriander
almost
like
a
belgian
trippel
or
dark
ale
the
mouthfeel
makes
this
one
a
bit
harder
to
wrap
my
buds
around
its
not
violently
bubbly
but
it
definitely
keeps
things
from
standing
around
notes
of
mint
tobacco
earthy
the
buffet
of
flavors
are
definitely
trying
to
gang
up
on
the
hop
dominance
very
good
beer
and
pretty
perfect
for
a
spring
choice
strong
yet
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
black
ales
are
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
an
excellent
example
a
real
multipurpose
beer
that
could
serve
as
a
winter
warmer
or
a
refreshing
drink
on
a
warm
spring
day
highly
recommend
pours
dark
amber
with
initial
inch
of
creamy
foam
that
settles
down
to
about
14
inch
deep
malty
smell
with
a
lurking
grassy
pine
smell
prfounding
hoppy
taste
with
a
lingering
burn
resin
like
taste
remains
on
the
toingue
can
alsmot
taste
the
hop
oils
very
good
taste
a
little
to
harsh
to
drink
lots
of
but
good
batting
third
yakima
glory
from
victory
must
admit
i
was
expecting
a
imperial
ipa
instead
i
find
out
that
it
is
a
potent
american
black
ale
it
is
not
too
bad
high
abv
is
definitely
present
yikes
i
think
my
lid
flipped
the
color
is
a
cloudy
dark
amber
it
has
a
nice
foaming
head
that
laces
well
the
taste
is
initially
overpowered
by
the
high
abv
but
eventually
settle
into
a
decent
sipping
beer
no
way
would
i
session
this
and
the
abv
keeps
the
score
lower
for
me
conclusion
if
i
saw
this
on
the
store
shelf
id
probably
look
a
little
harder
to
find
something
i
like
better
it
is
a
very
respectable
beer
but
not
one
id
search
out
the
powerful
hop
presence
and
8
7
abv
mean
that
one
may
not
like
to
have
many
of
these
consecutively
but
it
is
nonetheless
a
great
hop
showpiece
displayed
on
a
canvas
of
dark
roasted
malts
i
could
have
a
few
the
8
7
is
well
hidden
in
a
so
many
layers
of
yummy
goodness
real
interesting
beer
good
for
drinakbility
and
could
have
again
this
one
strikes
me
as
interesting
to
try
on
tap
i
think
it
might
even
be
better
possibly
d
excellent
beer
that
i
would
drink
all
night
as
with
most
victory
products
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
very
enjoyable
and
pleasing
to
the
palate
could
sit
around
and
suck
on
these
for
a
quite
a
while
the
drinkability
is
good
it
could
be
a
bit
more
interesting
and
dynamic
but
it
is
a
solid
beverage
mouthfeel
is
great
as
the
beer
is
very
full
and
creamy
at
times
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
due
to
the
finish
and
also
due
to
the
8
7
abv
being
pretty
visible
and
not
in
a
good
way
i
like
this
beer
but
it
was
a
bit
disappointing
to
me
overall
this
was
an
interesting
brew
the
ingredients
meshed
into
some
unique
aromas
and
flavors
this
wasnt
the
best
black
ale
but
it
definitely
unique
and
good
d
overall
its
another
solid
delivery
from
victory
i
enjoy
taking
my
time
with
this
one
as
it
warms
up
you
can
definitely
notice
the
abv
i
bought
one
and
then
bought
a
case
and
have
been
enjoying
each
one
ever
since
drinkability
i
didnt
like
this
one
as
much
as
i
remembered
from
the
past
but
it
is
still
quite
good
i
would
like
a
bit
more
of
the
nutty
roast
when
i
take
a
sip
that
being
said
im
sure
ill
end
up
having
it
again
d
besides
the
longstanding
bitterness
i
was
getting
on
the
finish
id
love
this
beer
however
the
unpleasant
aftertaste
is
probably
going
to
make
this
a
oneanddone
selection
for
me
victory
is
a
killer
brewery
and
everything
they
make
is
worth
drinking
this
one
may
just
be
a
matter
of
my
own
personal
preference
but
ill
stick
to
hopdevil
if
im
looking
for
bitterness
this
went
down
pretty
smoothly
so
i
guess
drinkability
is
pretty
high
for
me
im
not
completely
sold
on
the
style
but
this
is
one
on
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
theres
no
shortage
of
citrus
and
grass
in
the
nose
a
touch
of
chocolate
but
little
in
the
way
of
dark
roast
taste
is
more
of
the
same
its
more
like
a
malty
but
flavorful
east
coast
ipa
instead
of
a
proper
cda
plenty
of
pine
and
grassy
hops
with
a
nice
juicy
citrus
presence
as
well
respectably
bitter
finish
is
all
juicy
hops
and
caramel
wheres
the
roast
id
be
scoring
this
significantly
higher
as
a
regular
ipa
but
as
a
cda
it
falls
flat
on
a
positive
note
its
more
bitter
and
flavorful
than
most
east
coast
ipas
d
i
imagine
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
just
find
the
flavors
to
clash
and
leave
a
unpleasant
aftertaste
one
and
done
is
good
for
me
ill
scale
the
grade
with
style
in
mind
i
first
tried
this
last
year
when
it
was
yakima
twilight
and
i
think
at
that
point
id
only
had
1
other
black
ale
stone
11
i
believe
it
was
remarkably
good
then
and
after
having
many
more
black
ales
over
the
intervening
year
i
still
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
a
very
good
highly
drinkable
beer
and
a
perfect
nonspiced
winter
seasonal
overall
its
a
very
bold
beer
and
extremely
hoppy
beer
but
it
tends
to
smooth
out
as
it
warms
definitely
not
sessionable
but
its
a
nice
1
stop
visit
when
your
palet
is
in
the
mood
for
a
strong
hop
bite
drinkability
this
goes
down
very
easily
for
an
8
abv
the
taste
is
very
nice
and
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
i
really
like
this
beer
and
will
likely
buy
it
again
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
good
complex
bold
flavor
that
was
relatively
easy
to
drink
do
good
beer
dont
know
if
id
want
any
more
than
one
or
two
d
this
is
a
very
complex
beer
with
both
the
hops
and
malt
flavors
battling
each
other
i
will
give
this
another
shot
or
two
in
the
future
pours
a
very
dark
brownmahogany
with
one
finger
of
tan
head
with
good
retention
fascinating
aromas
malts
and
hops
are
equally
dominant
and
the
hops
are
surprisingly
ipalike
the
malt
aromas
are
of
charred
chocolatey
sweetness
and
the
hops
are
piney
and
resinous
the
overall
effect
is
that
of
a
smore
cooked
on
a
sappy
pine
stick
flavorwise
complex
hops
actually
dominate
the
front
and
midpalates
before
dark
chocolate
comes
in
on
the
finish
the
taste
of
chocolatecovered
orange
peel
lingers
long
an
intriguing
beer
one
that
id
happily
buy
again
honestly
not
my
top
pick
for
this
style
but
i
could
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
another
glass
or
two
in
the
future
i
am
especially
interested
in
seeing
how
this
is
on
draft
d
this
is
a
very
good
black
ale
with
unique
characteristics
of
both
ipas
and
stouts
combined
in
a
manner
i
have
only
found
in
this
beer
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
hybrid
styles
can
be
and
is
my
favorite
black
ipa
in
the
end
a
very
nice
beer
this
is
a
interesting
style
of
beer
and
victory
does
a
good
job
representing
it
if
you
like
this
and
live
in
michigan
try
good
humans
by
shorts
brewing
they
must
share
a
grain
bill
and
hop
schedule
to
a
certain
degree
because
of
the
unique
flavors
hints
of
bitter
pine
come
out
in
the
aroma
and
taste
as
the
beer
descends
to
the
wider
portion
of
the
snifter
the
bitterness
sticks
to
the
palate
and
its
not
super
pleasant
this
is
a
easydrinking
beer
for
8
7
abv
but
there
are
more
fun
victory
beers
available
d
at
8
7
abv
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
muscle
thru
half
of
it
and
end
up
giving
the
rest
to
one
of
my
friends
but
it
was
gone
before
halftime
updated
with
a
older
bottle
believed
to
be
near
best
by
date
definitely
preferred
over
fresh
one
this
aged
bottle
is
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
the
hop
grit
so
often
associated
with
ipas
coats
my
tongue
throughout
quite
unique
in
my
experiences
for
a
black
ale
this
is
a
real
treat
and
is
also
smooth
despite
the
rather
high
abv
this
is
no
sipper
very
enjoyable
and
yet
another
terrific
beverage
from
one
of
the
finest
breweries
around
victory
has
done
it
again
and
with
yakima
glory
has
successfully
melded
rampedup
hops
with
heavy
malt
to
produce
a
splendid
tasty
beer
excellent
creativity
and
craftsmanship
yakima
glory
is
very
well
done
a
good
sipping
beer
but
i
think
the
black
is
stronger
than
the
ipa
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
one
finger
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
on
the
nose
it
is
a
combination
of
a
conifer
with
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
underneath
its
a
really
clean
aroma
on
the
tongue
the
chocolate
flavors
hit
up
front
with
a
whole
load
of
the
piney
hop
bitterness
following
close
behind
in
the
mouth
its
pretty
thin
but
it
compensates
a
little
bit
with
the
bitterness
sticking
around
for
a
while
a
pretty
good
beer
and
now
im
interested
in
the
style
d
for
me
huge
it
goes
down
so
easily
if
it
werent
for
the
fairly
decent
abv
id
enjoy
more
than
just
a
few
at
a
time
i
loved
it
last
year
and
love
it
this
year
another
good
one
from
victory
well
balanced
but
complex
dark
but
an
ale
not
a
contradiction
but
a
confirmation
that
black
and
ale
can
coexist
on
a
beer
label
victory
yakima
glory
has
a
dark
reddish
colour
and
a
nice
5
mm
head
that
fades
to
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
of
piney
hops
with
some
sourness
there
may
be
some
yeastiness
too
the
initial
flavour
is
hoppy
but
the
taste
develops
into
a
roasty
charcoal
finish
the
flavour
is
lovely
probably
my
favourite
example
of
this
style
this
beer
feels
creamy
in
my
mouth
the
charcoal
flavour
builds
as
you
drink
more
but
its
still
a
delicious
beer
that
combines
some
interesting
elements
of
an
ipa
and
a
stout
d
i
really
like
this
beer
its
good
to
grab
when
you
need
a
change
of
pace
its
goes
down
a
helluva
lot
easier
than
the
abv
would
have
you
think
and
its
another
fine
offering
from
victory
d
good
drinkability
on
this
one
this
is
only
the
2nd
black
ale
that
ive
had
and
i
think
its
pretty
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
flavor
to
it
black
ales
are
kind
of
a
weird
style
imo
but
id
try
this
beer
again
for
sure
good
tasty
ale
for
hop
fans
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
dark
very
dark
borderline
black
slight
lacy
head
decent
hop
aroma
nothing
overpowering
but
very
well
balanced
slightly
sweet
smell
pleasing
to
the
nose
is
an
understatement
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
ive
ever
had
citruslike
hoppinness
without
an
overpowering
bitterness
bite
slight
sweetness
at
the
end
which
mutes
down
the
hops
just
enough
a
little
watery
for
my
liking
in
the
feel
but
ill
deal
with
it
and
leave
it
at
above
average
aside
from
the
heavy
alc
content
i
could
drink
this
exclusively
every
day
and
every
night
another
great
offering
from
victory
brewing
co
i
love
reading
the
verbiage
on
beer
bottles
and
this
one
is
no
different
it
would
have
been
nice
however
if
victory
had
listed
the
different
varieties
of
hops
used
in
this
beer
since
it
is
the
aroma
and
flavor
of
hops
that
stands
in
the
forefront
of
this
brew
great
beer
good
sipper
good
cold
weather
beer
with
great
hops
d
this
is
terrific
and
one
of
the
only
black
ales
i
enjoy
ddecent
representation
of
the
black
ipa
style
d
alcohol
is
totally
masked
very
drinkable
and
tasty
can
be
paired
with
spicy
dishes
overall
i
was
expecting
something
totally
different
for
my
first
american
black
aleblack
ipacascadian
dark
instead
of
black
and
hoppy
i
got
amber
and
smooth
but
in
the
end
i
really
liked
this
beer
cheers
d
a
nice
black
ale
taste
more
like
a
black
ipa
either
way
not
too
bad
would
def
try
again
md
a
decent
black
ipa
the
hops
leave
a
slightly
unpleasant
bitterness
and
this
beer
didnt
pair
up
well
with
some
dark
chocolate
i
had
still
the
mix
of
roast
and
bitter
hops
is
intriguing
and
worthy
of
purchase
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
fairly
clear
but
a
bit
of
haze
smallish
to
nonexistant
white
head
kind
of
a
really
thick
brownale
scent
pretty
malty
nose
but
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
and
some
bittering
hops
as
well
kind
of
the
same
idea
as
the
scent
its
like
a
highoctane
brown
ale
given
my
general
dislike
of
brown
ales
this
is
actually
pretty
good
prominant
malt
from
with
some
nutiness
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
and
a
visible
alcohol
spice
fairly
wet
and
medium
bodied
certainly
not
something
youll
taste
every
day
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
do
think
that
it
is
a
little
better
on
tap
but
still
very
good
out
of
the
bottle
a
quick
description
for
me
would
be
roasted
hop
devil
12
finger
light
tan
head
resulted
in
broken
layer
on
top
of
amber
brown
clear
body
medium
dissipation
with
some
spider
leg
retention
minimal
streams
of
carbonation
rising
i
thought
the
color
was
light
for
style
needs
more
carafin
nose
is
caramel
malt
dominated
some
floral
and
very
slight
citrus
notes
no
roast
taste
is
pretty
sweet
for
style
cuts
into
impact
of
hops
caramel
some
citrus
pretty
well
balanced
but
light
on
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
pretty
good
effervescence
good
drinkability
despite
noticeable
alcohol
heat
if
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
abacda
the
color
was
not
indicative
of
the
style
and
the
hops
werent
assertive
enough
irrespective
of
absence
of
roasted
malt
verdict
a
very
good
beer
anbd
worth
tracking
down
but
not
for
the
timid
d
a
nice
black
ale
a
little
above
average
from
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
carbonated
i
think
it
might
be
a
little
too
thick
when
considering
the
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
the
drinkability
however
is
excellent
any
hint
the
nearly
9
abv
is
completely
masked
by
the
malts
and
its
super
drinkable
a
very
interesting
and
wellcomposed
beer
im
not
sure
if
id
want
a
sixpack
of
this
but
im
sure
one
here
or
there
wouldnt
hurt
this
was
soso
for
me
overall
i
would
have
it
again
but
it
didnt
really
strike
me
as
outstanding
this
one
pours
and
nice
brownish
hue
a
shade
darker
than
amber
not
black
and
with
a
nice
ipaesque
head
and
lacing
nice
hoppy
aroma
pine
and
tobacco
mingled
with
a
sturdy
malt
base
this
is
a
really
well
balanced
beer
the
focus
is
on
hops
with
a
nice
bitter
bite
up
front
but
also
plenty
of
malt
character
and
a
nice
mellow
roastyness
nutty
and
toasty
too
theres
enough
malt
balance
that
this
doesnt
come
across
as
a
super
bitter
beer
but
the
finish
is
dry
and
lingering
real
nice
this
contributes
to
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
also
i
was
drinking
this
last
weekend
and
now
i
realize
why
i
got
a
little
tipsy
8
7
i
was
tossing
em
back
thinking
it
was
a
perfect
session
beer
well
it
kind
of
is
real
nice
to
drink
as
long
as
you
arent
going
anywhere
a
bold
american
ale
by
victory
a
tasty
and
easy
drinking
black
ale
from
victory
overall
i
still
am
a
very
big
fan
of
this
beer
but
i
dont
believe
the
cask
conditioning
did
it
any
favors
worth
a
shot
however
you
can
get
it
but
its
better
ontap
or
from
a
bottle
with
full
carbonation
the
taste
is
great
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
its
caramaly
bisquity
and
full
of
hoppy
goodness
medium
body
sticky
and
bitter
on
the
palate
pretty
tasty
drinking
especially
since
the
alcohol
is
masked
well
im
not
totally
into
black
ipas
but
this
was
pretty
tasty
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
brew
and
has
a
high
alcohol
level
that
is
hard
to
detect
another
winner
from
victory
d
decent
dryness
of
the
aftertaste
keeps
you
drinking
this
was
definitely
more
dark
than
ipa
lower
carbonation
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
and
creamy
head
no
hint
of
the
almost
9
abv
2015
update
pours
blood
red
color
with
a
thick
foamy
2
finger
tan
head
that
had
a
lot
of
speckles
in
it
and
faded
extremely
slowly
leaving
great
foamy
lacing
raised
the
look
quite
a
bit
in
the
review
based
on
this
went
from
3
to
3
75
smells
very
dank
and
fruity
like
fresh
hops
dark
fruit
caramel
and
thick
brown
sugar
in
a
glass
the
nose
and
taste
are
both
very
sweet
very
fruity
and
full
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
with
a
rich
malty
sweetness
like
molasses
syrup
and
fermented
candied
sugar
not
sure
if
its
the
hops
or
the
malt
but
either
way
its
very
sweet
and
potent
which
lets
traces
of
the
abv
come
through
like
barrel
aged
booze
pretty
bitter
and
a
little
too
sweet
but
better
than
i
remember
it
a
few
years
back
lacks
the
balance
i
hoped
for
but
better
this
time
around
overall
a
nice
beer
i
wish
the
overeager
server
wouldnt
have
taken
my
glass
when
i
got
up
to
get
another
beer
mediumlight
body
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malts
bitter
but
not
overly
pungent
d
fairly
drinkable
but
the
light
body
and
sharp
roast
hurt
the
overall
drinkability
d
this
is
a
one
or
two
at
a
time
max
type
of
beer
good
punch
of
flavor
that
will
erase
the
taste
of
that
crap
beer
you
just
had
but
anything
more
than
that
could
kill
your
buds
for
the
night
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
despite
the
high
abv
a
little
stronger
than
most
in
the
style
but
very
good
d
a
drinkable
beer
as
there
is
nothing
overwhelming
about
it
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
maltier
dark
pale
ale
than
this
is
a
decent
choice
very
drinkable
but
at
almost
9
its
certainly
not
a
session
beer
works
well
as
a
winter
beer
but
it
would
suit
any
season
another
great
beer
from
victory
an
exciting
delicious
brew
fit
for
hopheads
so
get
yourself
some
blazing
hot
curry
and
let
this
puppy
tear
right
through
it
and
finish
the
whole
thing
off
with
a
gingerbread
man
or
too
an
excellent
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
frothy
mocha
head
the
smell
is
sweet
with
a
hoppy
nose
and
subtle
malt
undertone
the
flavor
is
big
much
bigger
than
the
smell
the
flavor
starts
with
a
hop
kick
and
some
bitterness
that
sticks
through
the
aftertaste
the
beer
moves
into
a
nice
malt
background
but
the
star
of
the
beer
is
that
citrus
hop
flavor
that
continues
to
build
as
you
drink
the
mouthfeel
could
be
better
not
so
smooth
but
still
enjoyable
a
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
nice
drinker
lots
of
flavor
the
higher
abv
isnt
noticeable
had
this
on
tap
at
the
pony
bar
in
new
york
city
pours
a
dark
brown
colour
with
a
finger
of
white
head
nice
head
retention
as
some
head
remained
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
hops
with
a
huge
roasted
malt
flavour
has
some
bitterness
but
the
roasty
sweetness
seems
to
shine
more
here
medium
bodied
carbonation
this
is
a
very
nice
cascadian
dark
ale
and
im
sure
to
have
it
when
im
in
the
us
agian
the
tastes
are
all
over
the
place
earthy
hop
roasted
and
crystal
malts
all
come
together
to
form
an
almost
blackberry
flavor
that
finishes
dry
nice
notes
solid
ipa
with
a
bigger
malt
backbone
than
typical
though
no
where
near
a
barleywine
great
option
if
you
wanted
something
very
flavorful
and
more
balanced
im
intriged
by
this
brew
it
was
not
what
i
expected
but
its
interesting
the
challenge
of
black
ipas
is
to
balance
the
hops
and
malt
obviously
and
somehow
get
them
to
compliment
one
another
kind
of
a
waterandoil
thing
this
one
does
this
well
drinkability
solid
black
ipa
but
i
have
had
better
the
beer
had
a
medium
body
to
it
with
a
nice
dry
hop
aftertaste
the
beer
had
good
drinkability
and
was
smooth
but
as
the
beer
warmed
the
alcohol
was
noticeable
in
the
aroma
and
some
in
the
taste
but
this
did
not
distract
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
overall
another
quality
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
and
i
could
see
myself
really
enjoying
this
style
of
beer
d
this
is
a
very
good
black
ipa
although
it
is
not
as
dark
in
color
as
most
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
bitterspicy
burnt
citrus
up
front
not
too
strong
joined
by
caramelised
raisin
and
citruscandy
sweetness
some
juicy
yeastiness
it
is
fairly
balanced
up
front
but
after
the
finish
lingering
spicy
bitterness
hangs
around
too
long
it
has
light
raisiny
alcohol
but
not
boozy
despite
the
abv
it
is
a
bit
onedimensional
as
with
aroma
very
humdrum
etc
but
it
is
a
wellmade
beer
otherwise
and
what
flavours
it
has
are
clear
and
bright
reasonably
balanced
and
drinkable
despite
the
failings
tediousness
and
high

a

a

of
a

we
had
a

though
overall
a
really
good
bipa
that
is
very
refreshing

here
in

seasonal
so
ill
have
to
get
my
fill
now
and
add
to
my
list
to
look
out
for
next
winter
if
avail
year
end
this
would
make
the
rotation
ry
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
finishes
bitter
and
dry
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
or
try
again
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
it
had
a
lot
of
flavor
to
it
and
was
pretty
good
overall
it
was
very
bitter
in
the
finish
with
both
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
adding
to
that
pretty
decent
beer
overall
but
roasted
malts
and
strong
hops
isnt
really
my
favorite
combo
overall
do
all
in
all
a
good
black
ipa
personally
ive
got
a
sneaking
suspicion
that
black
ipas
just
might
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
victory
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
ill
more
than
likely
reach
for
one
of
their
other
beers
before
this
one
worth
a
try
cheers
d
this
tastes
in
between
a
strong
amber
ale
and
a
pale
ale
i
think
its
really
intriguing
and
different
but
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
regularly
not
too
bad
though
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
beer
havent
had
anything
quite
like
it
before
although
when
it
gets
warm
the
alcohol
flavor
begins
to
overpower
everything
else
when
drank
cold
to
cool
the
alcohol
is
not
nearly
as
obvious
verdict
yakima
glory
is
a
solid
and
easily
drinkable
black
ipa
with
a
wellhidden
punch
ultimately
though
its
a
little
too
leafy
and
not
citrusy
enough
for
my
personal
tastes
d
this
beer
exhibits
a
slight
astringent
note
at
the
end
of
the
taste
which
lowers
the
drinkablity
of
the
beer
overall
really
interesting
beer
it
is
a
hybrid
but
i
have
no
idea
what
the
mix
is
as
in
which
styles
were
slammed
together
to
bring
together
the
concept
for
this
beer
d
this
beer
is
massively
flawed
not
really
requiring
further
dissection
in
that
regard
what
is
interesting
is
the
stylistic
place
from
where
this
beer
takes
its
inspiration
whereas
most
black
ipas
inherit
their
dark
genes
from
a
beer
of
porter
or
stout
parentage
leading
to
a
dominating
black
roastcoffee
malt
profile
this
beer
seems
to
have
decidedly
belgian
roots
stylistically
its
dark
qualities
remind
of
a
quadalbeit
not
a
very
refined
one
with
hop
flavors
that
are
mostly
dark
as
wellnuanced
perhapsthere
just
isnt
the
expected
clash
that
somehow
ends
up
working
in
the
best
examples
of
this
style
as
a
strong
sipper
this
beer
is
not
an
unqualified
mess
but
yakima
glory
lags
behind
many
other
worthier
examples
of
the
style
d
an
ok
black
ipa
but
too
much
alcohol
in
the
taste
would
try
again
the
mouthfeel
is
the
best
part
of
this
beer
in
my
opinion
i
love
how
the
malts
start
out
the
slick
feel
and
moves
quickly
into
a
swelling
bitterness
that
bitter
pinch
lasts
into
and
through
the
finish
lingering
the
perfect
amount
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
drink
i
like
what
victory
does
solid
beers
and
not
too
over
hyped
will
have
to
recommend
this
to
some
friends
slight
booze
bight
but
is
really
well
balanced
from
the
fruity
sweetness
of
the
hops
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
of
these
easy
beautiful
colour
slightly
less
expansive
aroma
and
a
delightfully
robust
taste
profile
albeit
tasting
far
boozier
than
its
8
7
should
require
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
i
had
hoped
for
a
black
ipa
and
sweet
malty
notes
but
had
slight
underlying
nutty
notes
the
taste
had
a
better
hop
profile
which
meshed
well
with
the
caramel
flavor
with
citrusy
nutty
accents
and
a
decent
malt
backbone
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
light
tan

more
and

intriguing
personally
sweetwaterman
d
hop
bitterness
does
not
affect
the
drinkability
however
the
abv
is
a
little
too
high
for
me
in
regards
to
drinkability
this
ones
pretty
thick
as
you
might
expect
from
the
style
but
one
that
i
could
see
having
23
of
cheers
beautiful
deep
amber
red
in
color
has
a
lasting
offwhite
head
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
very
balanced
smell
between
the
malts
and
hops
smell
is
sweet
slightly
bitter
i
can
smell
a
somewhat
toasted
character
along
with
grapefruits
and
a
little
piny
smell
towards
the
end
very
simple
in
that
area
lots
of
sweet
toasted
malts
at
first
but
then
citric
hops
come
in
not
too
much
though
somewhat
light
for
an
ipa
it
finishes
bitter
and
leaves
a
citric
hops
lingering
aftertaste
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
thick
with
lots
of
carbonation
washes
over
the
palate
cleanly
i
dont
think
i
would
be
able
to
drink
more
than
a
couple
of
these
flavors
are
well
balanced
but
something
seems
to
be
missing
the
abv
is
pertty
hight
as
well
a
sixer
of
these
i
would
be
pretty
drunk
thanks
to
johnnnniee
i
was
able
to
try
this
one
out
not
really
jiving
with
this
one
probably
one
and
done
for
me
notes
not
really
a
great
example
of
the
new
style
and
as
big
a
joke
as
capt
krunkles
is
trading
wise
atleast
it
is
better
than
this
beer
is
a
dark
brown
the
shade
of
black
tea
not
much
of
a
head
aroma
is
surprisingly
complex
toast
malt
cherries
orange
cocoa
taste
is
bitter
and
hoppy
with
a
big
malt
backbone
finish
is
dry
and
hoppy
with
hints
of
cherry
or
something
that
i
cant
quite
place
taste
was
a
little
less
complex
than
i
was
expecting
given
the
aroma
still
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
well
carbonated
and
the
alcohol
provides
a
little
warmth
but
is
hidden
well
fairly
drinkable
its
somewhat
heavy
and
so
not
a
beer
id
probably
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
mildly
drinkable
beer
tiny
bit
too
much
bite
for
me
nice
balance
the
8
7
abv
is
not
at
all
noticeable
so
be
careful
with
this
one
very
enjoyable
as
i
am
not
so
into
the
sweet
browns
i
could
have
this
beer
again
and
again
d
very
drinkable
very
nice
black
ipa
everything
ive
written
above
is
basically
a
longer
version
of
i
like
the
malts
here
but
dont
particularly
enjoy
the
hops
and
the
sooner
they
fade
away
the
better
i
dug
the
malt
profile
that
i
somehow
could
discern
through
it
all
a
different
hop
combination
could
turn
this
into
a
winner
its
a
vague
reference
but
my
overall
take
on
the
hop
flavors
was
a
scent
i
remember
vividly
of
a
styrofoam
block
used
to
hold
a
silk
flower
arrangement
help
me
out
with
this
if
you
know
what
im
talking
about
dm
overwhelming
maltiness
really
dominates
the
pallet
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
not
a
good
thing
drinks
heavy
and
finishes
the
same
leaves
a
lingering
malty
taste
in
the
mouth
smells
juicy
as
you
pour
it
into
your
glass
and
then
an
huge
aromatic
smell
tells
you
that
this
has
a
lot
of
resinous
hops
you
smell
some
of
the
dry
malt
in
there
too
but
most
hop
dominating
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
amazing
whole
flower
resinous
pine
like
grapefruit
hops
hit
you
right
away
with
an
amazing
malt
sweetness
in
the
middle
the
malts
also
contribute
a
cherry
like
character
to
it
that
mixes
very
well
with
the
bitterness
this
actually
reminds
me
of
sierra
nevada
celebration
ale
but
with
more
resinous
hops
yakima
valley
washington
must
be
a
serene
place
it
also
finishes
very
dry
on
top
of
that
they
sell
a
pretty
much
9
percent
beer
in
6
packs
this
is
awesome
and
will
really
make
that
10
dollars
i
paid
for
it
worth
while
is
it
me
or
does
hop
devil
hop
wallop
and
yakima
glory
all
smell
and
taste
the
same
pours
out
a
brown
hazy
color
with
tan
head
which
quickly
dissappated
not
very
effervescent
upon
pour
not
much
lacing
which
seems
odd
smells
like
deep
resinous
pine
strange
that
this
beer
smells
slightly
reminiscent
of
their
imperial
stout
storm
king
same
hops
i
am
thinking
give
it
that
familiar
spiceyness
and
citric
quality
wow
the
taste
is
actually
very
smooth
for
such
a
big
beer
i
can
see
these
going
down
toooo
easy
big
leafy
hop
grapefruit
bite
followed
by
some
sweet
malt
but
not
too
sweet
and
pine
finish
this
beer
is
a
bit
hard
to
place
definitely
a
few
shades
darker
than
my
other
favorite
hoppy
beer
alpha
king
more
toastyness
from
the
darker
malts
perhaps
some
toffee
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
besides
big
hops
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
little
alcohol
coming
through
in
the
taste
overall
this
beer
is
quite
nicely
balanced
makes
me
wish
more
beers
came
off
this
way
if
your
a
fan
of
victory
brews
specifically
storm
king
think
of
this
as
perhaps
a
storm
king
light
if
that
is
not
totally
beyond
absurd
enjoy
this
one
easy
but
reach
for
the
top
d
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ipa
it
achieves
a
balance
between
the
dark
malt
character
and
the
hops
that
most
dont
manage
while
it
also
avoids
any
chocolate
or
coffee
flavor
that
would
confuse
it
with
a
stout
the
hops
are
significant
but
with
the
thick
malt
profile
they
are
really
just
barely
enough
to
balance
the
beer
very
nice
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
is
worth
seeking
out
d
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
victory
brews
and
one
of
my
goto
drinks
this
time
of
year
if
only
the
hop
devil
and
hop
wallop
could
be
this
fantastic
one
of
the
black
ipas
ive
had
thats
actually
welldone
and
worth
buying
again
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
plan
on
having
more
soon
fairly
heavy
bodied
but
easy
to
drink
1
or
2
this
beer
poured
a
clear
dark
amber
and
formed
nice
foamy
light
tan
head
that
left
lattice
lace
looked
like
a
root
beer
float
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
malt
hops
caramel
and
chocolate
the
flavor
was
of
malt
hops
and
cocoa
the
body
was
medium
light
the
finish
was
bittersweet
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
the
pepper
was
too
over
the
top
and
i
left
the
glass
only
half
drained
highly
recommended
deasy
to
drink
and
another
is
certainly
an
option
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
both
the
smell
and
taste
which
makes
this
beer
rather
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
despite
the
astringency
im
not
sure
but
i
heard
that
last
years
batch
wasnt
as
astringent
the
flavor
is
rich
and
deep
and
i
sure
hope
next
year
this
astringency
is
taken
care
of
this
gets
a
5
for
drinkability
without
a
doubt
considering
the
fact
that
this
is
basically
a
9
ipa
im
not
sure
ive
had
anything
more
drinkable
its
smooth
totally
balanced
warm
but
not
boozy
just
really
nice
to
drink
somehow
the
strong
malt
character
totally
mellows
the
hops
and
vice
versa
as
borat
would
say
great
success
d
purdy
dang
good
im
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
one
lived
up
to
my
expectations
for
both
the
cda
and
victory
as
a
brewery
very
drinkable
not
too
bitter
not
too
sweet
not
too
heavy
not
to
watery
with
just
the
right
amount
of
alcohol
suffice
it
to
say
its
incredibly
sessionable
and
i
can
foresee
many
more
of
these
in
my
near
future
1287
d
this
is
sort
of
like
a
darkened
double
ipa
imo
it
really
is
interesting
how
the
hops
and
citrus
blend
in
with
the
darker
malts
also
very
little
alcohol
is
detected
yet
it
is
8
7
whew
some
of
the
flavors
and
aromas
are
reminiscent
of
porter
and
scotch
ale
and
the
high
hop
factor
seems
to
fight
with
what
would
otherwise
be
a
delicious
hearty
beer
being
a
hophead
however
i
say
kudos
to
victory
for
creating
a
dark
ipa
that
isnt
black
definitely
worth
trying
more
than
once
this
is
a
tasty
brew
that
i
will
put
on
my
list
to
snag
when
i
can
find
it
pours
a
clean
deep
amber
to
orangeish
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
fresh
citrus
like
hops
in
the
taste
fresh
pine
hops
and
a
mellow
citrus
hop
with
a
nice
malty
backing
a
small
hop
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
fresh
hop
aftertaste
nice
balance
with
a
mixture
of
hops
scents
of
roasted
chocolate
and
molasses
malts
and
also
of
piney
nuts
on
the
nose
strong
peachy
scents
as
well
has
a
two
finger
head
with
good
lacing
down
the
glass
is
also
a
very
dark
redlight
black
colour
wow
this
one
blasts
through
the
palate
heavy
malty
flavor
mostly
of
a
heavy
ipa
bursts
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
strong
hoppiness
this
is
one
hell
of
a
brew
very
comparable
to
troegs
nugget
nectar
imo
delicious
beer
hmm
this
is
a
tough
one
its
very
much
delicious
and
all
but
the
style
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
i
would
only
rate
it
lower
due
to
the
fact
that
its
not
quite
where
it
should
be
stylewise
drinkability
suffers
as
my
impressions
change
from
first
sip
through
to
the
last
my
enjoyment
steadily
decreases
as
i
pick
up
more
sweetness
and
yeast
and
bitterness
and
alcohol
as
i
go
along
im
kind
of
flying
into
a
rage
right
now
as
i
ponder
the
12
99
spent
on
this
six
pack
but
im
calming
down
because
there
are
objectively
good
things
i
detect
amidst
all
the
downers
tastespicy
hops
toasted
malt
notedefinite
rye
spiciness
going
on
pretty
dry
finish
not
quite
a
black
ipa
in
color
but
more
in
the
flavor
profile
with
a
nice
balance
of
spicytoasted
malts
and
piney
hops
a
bit
of
a
surprise
in
taste
as
no
style
is
listed
on
the
bottle
but
certainly
worth
a
try
i
reviewed
my
notes
from
2009
and
i
believe
this
years
release
is
a
bit
darker
in
color
and
the
flavor
a
tad
more
intense
still
a
great
beer
and
an
a
in
my
book
it
has
a
beautiful
fall
color
a
light
hop
and
citrus
aroma
a
full
flavored
and
bodied
beer
little
if
any
unpleasant
after
taste
i
considered
this
one
of
the
best
beers
for
2009
a
couple
more
and
i
will
let
you
know
how
it
rates
for
2010
da
decent
release
from
victory
but
not
one
of
their
best
it
would
be
hard
to
drink
a
6
pack
of
this
cheers
on
cask
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
brown
almost
black
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
toasted
dark
malts
and
mild
pine
hops
the
taste
is
an
interesting
blend
of
toasted
caramel
malts
and
sharp
pine
hops
the
beer
is
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
with
smooth
subtle
carbonation
i
must
say
i
like
this
one
more
this
time
than
either
of
the
other
two
times
ive
had
it
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
amber
highlights
and
a
thick
and
frothy
tan
head
that
retains
well
and
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
equally
impressive
with
huge
juicy
and
citrusy
hop
notes
along
with
some
orange
marmalade
some
cocoa
and
light
coffee
notes
caramel
fruity
esters
and
some
alcohol
the
flavor
is
a
little
less
intense
with
piney
and
floral
hops
upfront
along
with
some
milk
chocolate
mocha
caramel
orange
marmalade
fruity
esters
and
moderate
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
drinkability
is
good
really
tasty
black
ipa
here
note
quite
on
the
level
of
ssr
but
not
far
off
either
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
because
it
is
an
interesting
brew
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
and
i
may
try
it
again
five
more
in
the
fridge
anyway
drinkibilty
was
a
nice
change
from
normal
ipas
enjoyed
the
bitterness
and
maltness
would
like
to
drink
a
few
more
of
these
overall
this
beer
is
decent
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
what
im
looking
for
in
a
cda
this
as
a
beer
is
not
too
bad
though
it
has
a
time
and
place
but
sort
of
falls
into
a
unique
category
pours
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
off
white
head
with
decent
enough
staying
power
some
nice
legs
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
quite
a
bit
of
malt
character
with
some
dark
fruits
and
candied
dark
sugar
also
a
fair
amount
of
piney
resinous
hops
the
taste
is
a
letdown
with
some
sweet
malt
failing
to
really
interact
with
the
piney
hops
and
the
darker
fruits
get
lost
in
the
background
feel
is
somewhat
sweet
yet
still
a
bit
dry
overall
an
interesting
beer
with
some
decent
characteristics
but
not
my
favorite
and
pales
in
comparison
to
some
others
within
this
emerging
style
di
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
not
a
session
beer
the
body
is
full
and
the
beer
can
be
filling
but
the
flavor
ranges
over
a
broad
spectrum
of
tastes
that
makes
for
an
experience
the
beer
is
not
overly
bitter
as
the
sweeter
malts
succeed
in
acting
against
the
hops
but
both
the
dark
bready
malt
sweetness
and
the
bright
fruity
and
floral
hop
flavors
create
a
flavor
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
the
black
ipa
is
true
harmony
in
a
glass
black
ipas
are
moving
way
up
the
ladder
in
my
preferred
beer
styles
and
this
one
is
a
very
strong
contender
another
really
strong
offering
from
victory
dseems
unbalanced
much
heavier
in
the
mouth
than
most
ipas
yet
still
oily
good
on
drinkability
even
though
i
cant
see
myself
ever
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
taste
preferences
fans
of
the
style
should
love
this
brew
d
tons
of
flavor
and
body
and
yes
alcohol
too
but
its
never
overwhelming
not
a
huge
ipa
person
but
this
is
simply
superb
craftmanship
d
i
had
pretty
high
expectations
on
this
beer
and
it
stacked
up
well
for
me
i
really
enjoyed
the
blend
of
hopsmalts
as
well
as
the
hidden
alcohol
that
basically
lends
a
warming
in
the
throat
the
alcohol
is
dangerously
hidden
so
watch
out
i
could
see
myself
sitting
down
with
a
couple
bottles
of
this
bitter
brew
pretty
damn
good
and
worth
the
10
50
a
sixer
price
tag
cheers
an
assault
on
the
pallete
for
sure
if
you
want
to
pair
this
one
with
food
make
sure
you
have
some
strong
flavors
going
on
in
your
dish
great
beer
my
only
criticism
would
be
that
its
just
a
bit
too
bitter
for
my
liking
other
than
that
its
awesome
d
despite
the
high
abv
i
could
drink
this
all
day
hmm
seems
like
i
like
this
one
a
fair
bit
more
than
most
folks
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
on
top
that
sits
around
for
a
good
while
really
enjoyed
the
dark
ipa
big
hops
flavor
some
citrus
and
then
all
kinds
of
darker
dried
fruit
flavors
in
there
as
well
roastiness
some
lighter
chocolate
and
some
light
caramel
as
well
big
mixed
flavors
that
mix
nicely
together
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
although
the
price
tag
was
a
little
higher
than
id
hope
d
pretty
big
on
this
one
8
7
hidden
pretty
well
though
fantastic
complex
beer
the
depth
of
the
flavor
is
great
with
enough
body
to
work
really
well
as
a
nice
ipa
option
for
a
cool
fall
evening
i
enjoyed
this
beer
first
time
ive
tried
a
dark
ipa
i
would
certainly
try
the
style
again
d
quality
brew
i
could
drink
plenty
of
it
another
dark
beer
with
a
serious
helping
of
bitter
hops
nice
citrus
aromatics
greet
you
looks
kiind
of
brown
not
black
so
mebbe
they
should
call
this
a
brown
ipa
whateva
it
is
it
is
freaking
great
really
digging
these
dark
hoppy
beers
goes
down
pretty
easy
for
the
high
abv
whatever
i
like
this
stuff
draft
poured
a
redtan
color
with
minimal
head
hop
notes
in
the
nose
of
slight
pine
very
malty
back
bone
on
this
one
with
a
hoppy
pine
ending
tasted
the
pine
flavors
more
than
i
thought
since
the
aroma
wasnt
that
strong
a
sipper
for
sure
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
a
rich
beer
it
is
very
active
on
the
tongue
and
has
a
very
good
balance
between
each
element
defintely
better
than
expectations
victory
always
seems
to
be
a
little
underwhelming
in
the
hop
department
but
this
was
just
right
yakima
twilight
is
rather
enjoyable
with
a
best
by
date
of
5
months
from
now
i
have
no
idea
how
old
this
beer
is
but
i
get
the
impression
it
wasnt
bottled
recently
maybe
i
would
like
it
more
fresh
in
any
case
this
is
a
creeper
despite
the
hidden
alcohol
drinkability
is
very
high
loved
it
well
done
pa
dangerously
tasty
md
medium
body
active
bubbly
carbonation
that
is
a
little
harsh
on
the
tongue
nothing
special
at
all
in
the
drinkability
department
alcohol
is
not
hidden
at
all
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
just
not
doing
much
for
me
im
good
for
one
and
ready
to
move
on
odd
beer
with
an
odd
taste
profile
a
nice
brew
im
never
in
the
must
be
aged
camp
but
laying
this
one
down
for
a
little
while
really
rounds
this
beer
out
in
my
opinion
in
fact
i
think
the
112010
may
be
too
conservative
an
estimate
for
a
best
by
date
drinkability
very
solid
hopforward
strong
dark
ale
i
would
be
tempted
to
classify
this
as
an
american
barleywine
has
a
lot
of
rich
malt
notes
with
the
raisin
and
molasses
but
with
wellmatched
hops
to
and
a
great
depth
of
flavor
that
makes
you
want
to
keep
coming
back
nice
this
is
tasty
and
enjoyable
not
a
session
beer
but
a
nice
winter
or
nightcap
choice
d
not
all
that
great
of
a
beer
the
aftertaste
is
really
off
putting
it
seems
like
this
beer
could
be
tweaked
a
bit
and
would
come
out
great
but
as
of
now
i
am
not
a
fan
and
will
not
seek
this
out
again
seems
to
become
more
ipa
like
as
it
warms
pours
a
dark
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
smells
pungently
of
pine
and
american
hop
varieties
taste
is
decidedly
bitter
some
chocolaty
malts
evident
but
the
hops
play
center
stage
here
and
they
are
of
good
quality
for
those
not
feint
of
heart
this
is
basically
an
ipa
a
good
but
not
great
one
drinkability
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
despite
its
high
abv
i
find
myself
getting
over
the
malt
characteristics
which
arent
my
favorite
in
order
to
sample
more
of
that
great
dynamic
hop
flavor
good
stuff
hmm
this
is
an
interesting
one
despite
the
abv
its
definitely
not
a
double
ipa
as
the
malt
backbone
is
prominent
but
its
for
sure
hoppy
enough
to
be
ipaleaning
drinkability
suffers
from
the
complexity
but
its
an
interesting
and
fairly
unique
beer
glad
i
had
it
not
necessarily
going
to
buy
a
case
of
it
d
dangerously
delicious
db
a
pretty
intensely
flavor
and
warmth
make
this
a
sipperone
bottle
at
a
time
thing
a
pretty
cool
combo
of
some
flavors
that
arent
always
blended
together
worth
trying
at
a
great
price
i
would
say
the
vine
notes
keep
this
one
from
being
great
d
id
love
to
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
but
the
abv
hits
me
harder
than
others
in
the
same
range
maybe
its
just
me
being
mellow
from
the
hops
edit
112210
just
got
a
very
fresh
sixpack
and
its
a
whole
different
world
hoppy
caramelly
and
toasty
more
like
a
india
brown
ale
than
a
black
ipa
but
damn
good
balanced
and
cohesive
another
outstanding
winner
from
the
great
victory
brewing
they
never
fail
to
please
be
careful
because
at
8
7
abv
you
do
not
want
to
have
more
than
a
few
deep
mahogany
color
fine
tan
head
the
aroma
is
a
balance
of
dark
fruit
malt
and
piney
hops
dark
fruit
comes
through
up
front
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
slightly
vinous
malt
profile
with
a
minerally
woody
tinge
hops
are
plentiful
and
pervade
the
palate
with
citrus
rind
bitterness
and
hints
of
pine
a
punchy
beer
with
equally
pronounced
malt
and
hops
for
all
the
fruit
flavors
from
the
malt
the
beer
is
pretty
clean
and
finishes
semi
dry
another
nice
one
from
victory
d
meehh
this
is
one
with
no
je
ne
sais
quois
its
just
what
it
is
not
bad
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
d
one
and
done
for
me
its
good
and
i
feel
like
it
fits
the
style
well
but
its
a
bit
too
aggressive
on
the
hops
for
me
drinkability
they
should
keep
this
in
the
line
up
superb
a
new
fav
of
mine
overall
a
very
nice
beer
worth
trying
when
you
see
it
overall
this
is
a
delicious
and
complex
beer
that
really
defies
any
kind
of
classification
another
great
offering
from
victory
dreally
this
brew
kind
of
lacks
drinkability
for
me
to
an
extent
i
think
its
flavor
profile
is
unique
which
deserves
merit
but
it
just
isnt
there
for
me
overall
a
very
big
well
balnced
beer
that
refuses
to
be
pigeonholed
into
a
style
or
class
in
my
opinion
great
with
german
chocolate
cake
d
i
found
this
very
drinkable
dangerously
maybe
i
only
bought
one
at
the
time
but
i
dont
see
myself
making
that
mistake
again
these
go
down
quickly
for
me
silky
and
bursting
with
hop
flavor
thank
you
victory
d
ok
drinkability
this
is
a
fairly
big
beer
that
showcases
them
hops
so
balance
isnt
big
part
of
the
equation
im
very
happy
to
drink
one
of
these
but
no
more
than
that
in
a
sitting
overall
a
fantastic
and
ballsy
strong
ale
from
the
state
of
pennsylvania
i
really
like
this
beers
dryness
it
has
the
texture
of
a
topshelf
gin
dry
and
smooth
with
a
little
grit
at
the
finish
the
perfect
balance
of
hops
and
sweet
malts
really
counterbalance
each
other
perfectly
without
muting
any
of
their
pronounced
qualities
there
is
a
little
heat
in
the
finish
from
the
high
alcohol
but
the
ultra
dry
hops
disguise
it
masterfully
a
beer
i
will
definitely
seek
out
this
november
i
sure
am
enjoying
mine
on
this
sunny
60f
early
spring
afternoon
pours
a
darkish
copper
with
onefinger
head
that
stays
around
for
awhile
a
clear
mix
of
herbal
springy
hops
and
a
thick
caramel
malt
base
along
with
hints
of
raisin
figs
and
dark
fruits
a
mix
of
very
large
hop
base
that
is
tied
to
a
thick
a
malt
base
for
a
leafy
tealike
beer
that
is
dry
but
unlike
an
ipas
overpowering
hopiness
this
beer
finishes
muted
and
subtle
with
some
sweet
malts
a
good
beer
that
has
a
chewey
feel
along
with
a
drying
sensation
for
a
beer
that
i
didnt
exactly
think
was
so
great
but
enjoyed
drinking
and
would
tell
anyone
to
try
once
the
flavor
tastes
pretty
balanced
at
first
then
the
hoppy
bitterness
comes
through
and
destroys
that
balance
finishes
bitter
but
its
not
pleasant
a
quality
brew
from
a
quality
company
but
for
me
this
is
lacking
served
at
a
cool
temperature
a
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
creamy
tan
head
smell
is
rich
toasty
malt
and
herbal
hops
taste
is
chocolate
and
caramel
up
front
with
a
herbal
hop
middle
and
a
piney
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
12
oz
at
a
time
but
an
excellent
beer
nonetheless
it
surely
cannot
be
a
coincidence
that
a
brewery
named
victory
is
seemingly
incapable
of
making
anything
less
than
stellar
if
not
spectacular
beer
like
i
said
yakima
twilight
has
a
loud
spirited
personality
one
that
probably
takes
some
getting
to
know
before
becoming
truly
comfortable
around
it
but
thats
exactly
why
i
keep
asking
their
beers
out
pours
a
reddish
browish
color
with
a
tan
head
sitting
astride
a
somewhat
thinnish
body
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
porter
jacked
up
with
tons
of
beautiful
citrusy
hops
very
drinkable
as
the
thin
body
doesnt
fill
you
up
and
the
hops
remain
fresh
and
vibrant
overall
im
loving
this
one
after
3
of
these
my
wife
dragged
me
to
the
door
as
i
was
ready
to
slam
these
the
rest
of
the
night
a
delicious
offering
from
victory
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
ruby
copper
color
with
a
creamy
er
cream
head
nice
bits
of
lacing
here
and
there
the
head
sticks
around
for
quite
some
time
the
aroma
reeks
of
hops
glorious
great
fruits
nice
biscuit
malts
taste
is
equally
lovely
lots
of
hops
a
decent
malt
bill
too
bready
caramels
lovely
the
hops
come
in
resinous
and
fruity
tones
grapefruit
and
the
likes
the
mouth
is
smooth
creamy
a
bit
lively
and
quite
warm
the
alcohol
giving
just
a
peak
in
all
a
quite
lovely
beer
d
it
wouldnt
be
too
difficult
to
down
a
couple
of
these
you
can
choose
to
sip
or
gulp
but
the
higher
abv
will
slow
you
down
overall
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
though
by
no
means
my
favorite
the
anise
taste
to
it
is
not
a
dealbreaker
but
was
an
unexpected
twist
for
me
still
im
being
harsh
this
is
a
good
beer
from
a
very
good
brewery
that
is
very
balanced
but
still
manages
to
keep
some
strong
flavoring
pours
a
dark
brownishred
color
with
a
beige
head
the
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
some
piney
and
resinous
notes
the
flavor
is
resiny
hops
and
is
quite
harsh
there
is
also
some
pine
and
medium
bitterness
high
carbonation
a
little
too
high
in
my
opinion
and
medium
mouthfeel
d
a
struggle
at
first
but
then
it
gets
smoother
as
you
drink
more
overall
i
was
expecting
alil
more
from
this
brew
just
sweet
malt
with
hardly
any
hops
to
back
it
up
i
guess
its
just
a
malt
lovers
ale
they
call
this
a
strong
ale
and
thats
just
what
it
is
strong
produces
plenty
of
head
which
seems
to
be
typical
of
victory
as
hoppy
as
a
double
ipa
but
perhaps
more
balanced
exhibits
a
deepdark
bronze
color
seems
just
right
to
me
if
you
like
plenty
of
hops
you
should
like
this
beer
i
liked
the
brew
but
one
a
sitting
would
be
enough
for
me
its
just
to
big
all
around
for
more
than
that
tasted
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
dark
amber
with
a
tint
of
red
with
an
offwhite
thin
but
lasting
head
the
initial
aroma
is
of
bitter
coffee
along
with
dark
chocolate
but
maintaining
a
fresh
hoppiness
as
well
the
malts
are
very
darkly
roasted
and
smell
a
bit
like
oats
the
palate
begins
with
the
same
bitter
notes
as
the
aroma
giving
way
to
grapefruit
floral
notes
and
hops
on
the
midpalate
and
ending
again
with
the
bitterness
the
finish
is
reminiscent
of
an
endive
bitterness
slightly
green
and
slowly
turning
back
into
the
familiar
grapefruit
flavor
this
does
not
feel
like
a
huge
beer
on
the
palate
but
the
carbonation
causes
a
very
round
feel
due
to
larger
bubbles
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
the
alcohol
content
is
very
well
integrated
and
the
complexity
is
more
than
acceptable
i
will
gladly
drink
this
beer
again
drinkability
this
is
a
worldclass
beer
that
deserves
the
highest
of
accolades
it
must
be
incredibly
difficult
to
pull
off
this
flavor
combination
but
victory
did
a
tremendous
job
a
little
too
much
of
a
good
thing
but
great
flavors
for
the
ipa
enthusiast
i
love
the
color
on
this
beer
a
deep
ruby
amber
color
with
big
sandy
brown
head
decent
lacing
good
retention
smell
is
robust
with
some
spicy
and
sweet
malt
notes
and
some
grassy
and
citrusy
hops
barleywineesque
taste
follows
reminds
me
a
little
of
what
i
would
imagine
75
arrogant
bastard
and
25
double
bastard
would
be
like
big
malty
flavors
a
fair
amount
of
caramel
and
lightly
roasted
notes
earthy
hops
follow
grassy
and
herbal
a
fair
amount
of
bitterness
here
fullbodied
and
creamy
definitely
a
sipper
though
a
nice
one
at
that
good
stuff
here
from
victory
one
of
the
best
value
breweries
imo
drinkability
i
like
this
much
better
than
arrogant
bastard
as
it
is
not
as
sticky
but
has
a
great
flavor
profile
carbonation
makes
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
lighter
than
you
might
expect
but
it
works
well
overall
the
brew
goes
down
well
and
is
generally
pretty
easy
to
drink
nice
i
had
this
on
tap
and
found
it
to
be
a
very
good
beer
i
think
i
liked
the
bottle
even
better
a
little
darker
than
i
expected
but
overall
a
great
beer
good
aroma
great
flavor
very
impressive
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
particularly
for
a
beer
with
that
abv
a
dark
copper
red
color
pour
with
a
big
long
lasting
foamy
white
head
leaving
lots
of
lacing
all
the
way
down
lively
carbonation
a
very
nice
looking
beer
aroma
is
of
sweet
toasty
caramel
malt
balanced
well
with
a
nice
amount
of
citrus
and
piny
hope
notes
a
little
spicy
flavor
is
a
lot
like
a
iipa
citrus
hops
to
a
nice
caramel
mixed
with
an
earthy
spruce
hop
flavor
nice
level
of
bitterness
nice
balance
the
lively
carbonation
gives
it
a
lighter
mouthfeel
than
you
would
expect
full
body
slight
warming
effect
with
a
hoppy
finish
covering
a
ever
so
slight
bit
of
alcohol
very
good
drinkable
and
enjoyable
all
around
nice
work
this
makes
for
an
interesting
comparison
to
arrogant
bastard
actually
as
they
have
some
similarities
despite
some
key
differences
the
profile
of
the
former
seems
better
integrated
but
yakima
seems
more
full
of
fresh
hop
flavors
so
it
would
depend
what
you
are
in
the
mood
for
d
one
of
the
most
unique
brews
i
have
had
from
victory
but
one
of
the
best
this
beer
is
a
beast
but
its
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
except
this
beer
wont
be
purchased
by
me
again
others
have
compared
this
to
stone
brewings
arrogant
bastard
iipa
yet
that
is
an
excellent
beer
and
this
does
not
compare
unimpressed
yet
many
others
are
overall
impression
this
is
victorys
answer
to
stones
arrogant
bastard
its
a
flavorful
and
complex
brew
a
great
beer
for
the
colder
months
drinkability
extremely
bitter
cross
between
an
english
strong
ale
and
an
american
barleywine
while
it
has
a
nice
complexity
the
bitterness
overwhelms
the
nuances
that
are
hidden
beneath
the
surface
a
must
for
any
beer
fan
a
really
pretty
beer
clear
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
huge
persistent
dense
off
white
head
smell
is
citrusy
hops
lemons
taste
is
again
is
mostly
citrus
hops
nice
caramelly
malt
some
bitterness
but
nicely
balanced
overall
i
like
that
its
just
a
bit
on
the
hoppy
side
great
full
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
victory
md
very
creamy
there
is
strong
carbonation
and
it
is
a
little
fizzy
in
the
finish
it
feels
a
little
slick
this
is
overall
a
very
enticing
very
warming
drink
and
i
wish
i
had
more
than
the
halfpint
serving
bottle
poured
into
large
snifter
dark
brownpurple
color
fizzy
with
half
an
inch
of
head
smell
is
a
perfumeish
mix
of
grains
and
pine
needles
taste
starts
grassy
with
dark
malts
and
finishes
bitter
with
biting
alcohol
and
hops
this
an
interesting
beer
with
a
barleywineesque
quality
to
it
despite
the
high
abv
and
obvious
presence
in
its
flavor
it
still
isnt
too
much
of
a
chore
to
drink
drinkable
brew
from
victory
yakima
twilight
is
a
dark
wood
and
leather
ale
with
a
huge
amount
of
earth
its
a
deep
and
wonderful
experience
skål
its
drinkable
with
a
unique
flavor
all
its
own
its
well
blended
has
interesting
flavors
and
delivers
the
alcohol
very
well
victory
hits
one
out
of
the
park
here
this
will
appeal
to
fans
of
superhoppy
ambers
ie
nugget
nectar
maltheads
and
anyone
looking
for
big
beers
with
lots
of
attitude
excess
of
character
and
most
importantly
balance
yum
all
and
all
a
very
tasty
beer
d
surely
hides
the
abv
well
i
was
guessing
closer
to
7
until
i
checked
it
here
on
ba
a
solid
brew
but
not
a
great
one
my
first
reaction
to
this
was
that
the
taste
was
as
equally
undynamic
as
the
nose
but
it
definitely
grew
on
me
certainly
grainy
hops
but
also
a
bit
of
acidic
spices
bitterness
is
in
the
aftertaste
but
with
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
considering
its
abv
but
not
my
favorite
strong
ale
thats
for
sure
purchased
a
growler
from
the
whole
foods
store
in
plymouth
meetin
pa
deep
rich
copper
pour
with
2
finger
head
calming
down
to
a
light
froth
during
the
drinking
stage
nose
of
hops
and
the
taste
was
a
great
combination
of
malts
and
hops
combining
sweet
with
bitter
for
an
ale
i
enjoyed
this
offering
it
treated
me
to
the
appreciation
of
fine
brewed
ales
which
i
was
not
appreciating
until
this
point
being
a
stoutporter
lover
and
shied
away
from
hop
brews
pours
dark
bodied
with
a
small
amount
of
offwhite
head
and
is
citrus
hoppy
above
else
closer
to
a
sipper
in
drinkability
it
is
married
with
a
vienna
this
is
not
sessionable
alcohol
and
i
was
getting
a
tad
of
alcohol
warming
m
high
carbonation
which
aids
in
keeping
the
bitterness
alive
on
the
tongue
perhaps
a
touch
high
but
a
great
experience
overall
d
i
like
hops
but
i
am
not
in
love
with
it
one
and
done
md
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
rough
on
the
palate
in
a
good
way
finishes
dry
due
to
the
high
alpha
acid
content
and
a
nice
alcohol
warming
factor
without
the
taste
very
drinkable
and
a
good
solid
strong
ale
but
not
something
exotic
overall
an
outstanding
ale
i
would
have
no
issue
at
all
with
trying
again
any
day
simply
stunning
this
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
the
head
is
absolutely
massive
and
recedes
at
a
glacial
pace
this
is
a
very
attractive
looking
beer
the
aroma
is
grapefruit
pine
with
some
malt
underneath
it
is
rather
underwhelming
for
a
beer
of
its
strength
its
real
weakness
is
its
lack
of
any
sort
of
complexity
in
fact
i
think
i
would
like
it
even
less
if
it
were
stronger
as
its
blandness
would
be
more
in
my
face
the
taste
is
a
mirror
image
of
the
aroma
and
equally
dull
too
there
is
a
noticeable
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
that
doesnt
really
improve
anything
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
texture
overall
this
is
a
big
disappointment
i
could
see
how
this
beer
might
be
enjoyed
by
the
crowd
whos
only
criteria
for
to
be
good
is
strength
but
im
not
in
the
crowd
and
i
expect
more
from
a
beer
rich
and
malty
i
wanted
more
hops
its
got
a
picture
of
a
hop
on
the
bottle
for
cyringoutloud
i
know
its
not
a
dipa
but
theres
a
picture
of
a
hop
isnt
it
it
tastes
like
a
regular
strong
ale
but
a
bit
bland
and
new
at
8
7
its
not
really
strong
with
a
oneyear
max
freshness
duration
its
blah
shouldnt
strong
ales
be
ripe
for
cellaring
the
carbonation
is
welldone
as
id
expect
from
victory
but
its
just
a
hopinfluenced
malt
beer
though
ill
go
with
a
relatively
average
rating
i
must
admit
im
disappointed
in
fact
the
feel
is
where
ill
take
it
down
a
notch
malt
blahness
its
left
begging
for
more
hop
influence
kinda
rich
without
significant
backing
it
feels
like
a
miss
as
for
drinkability
i
will
not
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
this
beer
is
a
shadowy
ruby
colored
liquid
topped
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
its
a
pretty
brew
but
the
appearance
doesnt
foreshadow
that
this
is
one
powerful
hopbomb
the
smell
is
all
about
hops
piny
resiny
citric
oily
sharp
and
serious
its
like
rubbing
your
nose
in
your
homebrewing
buddys
hop
harvest
there
is
a
little
malt
in
the
distance
but
its
hard
to
discern
a
specific
character
behind
all
the
hop
scents
the
taste
is
also
hopcentric
its
bitterness
has
a
nononsense
intensity
and
the
resiny
tannic
slightly
oily
sensations
are
amazing
there
is
a
little
more
malt
in
the
taste
breadcrumbs
and
toasted
crackers
the
finish
is
long
and
bitter
full
body
warming
this
is
one
adventurous
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
well
carbonated
a
bit
dry
very
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
this
goes
down
awfully
smoothly
it
would
be
way
too
easy
to
drink
3
or
4
of
these
end
up
totally
snockered
very
easy
to
drink
body
is
a
little
heavier
than
medium
appropriately
carbonated
smooth
surprisingly
easy
drinker
for
8

tasty
with
good
bitterness
not
much
lasting

which
knocks
it
down
a
notch
in
that
category

talking

notes
interesting
how
the

is

darker
on
the

and
the

likewise
an
assertive
but
pleasing

feels
better
accomplished
here
d
i
like
a
lot
of
the
elements
in
this
beer
but
it
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
a
decent
offering
from
victory
though
an
interesting
brew
i
cant
help
but
think
though
this
doesnt
fit
the
style
how
popular
the
black
ipa
is
becoming
almost
9
abv
and
tons
of
hop
complexity
would
stop
me
at
a
few
i
did
enjoy
this
and
plan
on
trying
it
again
this
is
listed
as
a
strong
ale
reminds
me
more
of
a
dipa
or
imperial
amber
mmmm
good
beer
served
with
a
fine
foamy
off
white
to
light
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
an
amber
brown
aroma
is
roasty
malty
hoppy
and
a
little
toffee
flavors
dominated
by
the
hops
but
it
works
well
with
the
roasty
malts
supporting
and
complimenting
the
hops
nicely
body
is
decent
and
so
is
carbonation
finish
is
mainly
like
the
flavor
and
is
long
with
alcohol
coming
out
towards
the
end
be
more
drinkable
except
for
the
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
quick
first
taste
of
caramelroasted
malts
and
dark
chocolate
followed
nicely
by
a
strong
pine
and
citrus
flavored
hops
bite
with
all
the
pine
flavor
and
aroma
i
pick
up
i
feel
like
im
hiking
through
a
forest
in
the
pacific
northwest
great
carbonation
level
accentuates
the
hops
crisp
dry
finish
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
in
the
mouth
for
minutes
after
the
beer
is
completed
a
good
beer
fairly
solid
nothing
really
stood
out
but
good
nonetheless
received
in
a
straight
pint
glass
a
very
dark
coppercoloured
pint
with
a
firm
head
that
doesnt
really
go
away
both
malt
and
hops
in
the
nose
piney
grassy
citrus
lots
of
caramel
and
chocolate
the
taste
is
somewhat
muted
after
the
big
blast
of
powerful
aroma
lets
just
call
it
subtle
and
dignified
bot
malt
and
hops
at
the
friend
and
a
superbly
dry
bitter
finish
with
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
and
lingers
good
if
slightly
oily
mouthfeel
very
nice
indeed
d
reminds
me
of
a
tamer
in
aromaflavor
arrogant
bastard
but
with
a
more
noticeable
numbing
alcohol
presence
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
does
recede
to
a
tan
head
and
ring
that
stays
to
the
end
the
smell
is
potent
its
hops
and
citrus
with
a
musty
peat
smell
and
some
roasted
caramel
the
taste
is
good
its
a
hop
blast
full
of
citrus
and
grass
it
has
roasted
caramel
some
toasted
malts
a
little
bit
of
semisweet
chocolate
there
is
alot
going
on
in
this
strong
the
mouth
feel
is
full
and
robust
with
many
layer
of
flavor
as
the
beer
warms
another
winner
from
victory
who
just
quietly
churns
out
brew
after
brew
after
brew
that
are
solid
overall
a
very
nice
beer
after
all
the
hassle
wren
had
to
go
through
to
finish
this
trade
im
going
to
savor
every
drop
of
this
beer
i
like
to
think
of
this
as
a
dark
ipa
especially
when
its
super
fresh
im
on
my
second
6pack
for
this
review
yakima
twilight
is
fantastic
ill
save
one
to
cellar
to
see
what
this
is
like
more
maltforward
but
i
dont
think
it
will
equal
what
im
drinking
right
now
md
again
somewhat
sticky
but
not
nasty
appropriate
for
the
style
really
easy
to
drink
and
the
awesome
flavor
keeps
me
going
back
for
more
d
abv
in
mind
pretty
damn
high
drank
1l
with
ease
would
buy
again
one
of
my
new
favorite
victory
beers
d
really
nice
victory
is
in
maine
but
have
not
seen
this
one
yet
anywhere
glad
to
finally
try
it
hope
it
gets
here
soon
d
twilight
is
a
bold
and
assertive
beer
and
makes
no
excuses
about
it
not
my
favorite
use
of
hops
as
i
prefer
citrus
amnd
floral
over
piny
and
bitter
however
i
think
this
was
likely
the
intent
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
a
solid
beer
overall
this
definitely
comes
off
as
more
of
a
strong
ale
than
an
ipa
to
me
as
it
lacks
the
citrus
fruit
flavors
that
ive
become
quite
fond
of
and
accustomed
to
in
ipas
if
youre
looking
for
a
strong
bitter
beer
that
packs
a
punch
this
one
will
not
disappoint
try
this
if
youre
a
fan
of
arrogant
bastard
and
are
curious
to
try
something
new
pours
a
nice
dark
golden
brown
color
nice
carbonation
very
nice
twofinger
creamy
light
tan
head
with
tons
of
thickcreamy
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
big
on
malts
and
caramel
the
taste
is
sweet
malty
with
lots
of
caramel
notes
very
slight
bitterness
medium
body
drinkable
really
liking
this
one
12oz
bottle
pours
a
dark
red
maroon
colour
with
lots
of
foam
lacing
the
duvel
glass
i
used
smell
is
of
piney
hops
but
doesnt
match
the
taste
taste
is
of
dark
malt
with
dark
fruits
with
a
lingering
of
the
hops
in
the
background
this
beer
drinks
very
smooth
for
the
alc
of
8
7
its
a
very
interesting
beer
and
seems
to
fall
inbetween
the
style
of
iipa
and
strong
ale
interesting
offering
dark
as
night
as
the
name
implies
with
a
big
head
of
cream
colored
foam
tons
of
lacing
and
great
head
retention
the
aroma
is
very
strong
on
the
bitter
hop
notes
with
grapefruit
and
dried
orange
peel
these
are
both
present
in
the
flavor
with
the
addition
of
a
stronger
malt
characteristic
caramel
and
particularly
chocolate
are
present
behind
the
hops
its
definitely
heavy
on
the
hops
which
is
why
it
loses
a
point
in
my
book
i
could
have
used
a
little
more
balance
but
its
not
bad
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
makes
this
one
pretty
drinkable
and
the
hop
finish
is
nice
and
super
bitter
overall
its
a
very
good
beer
i
think
i
can
see
some
people
being
put
off
by
its
blend
of
massive
hops
and
chocolaty
flavorsin
fact
i
dont
really
love
this
one
personallybut
i
think
its
very
well
made
and
definitely
worth
trying
this
might
be
my
favorite
ipa
of
the
2009
calendar
year
hops
come
to
mind
first
and
are
hard
to
look
past
but
malts
give
a
slight
sweet
aroma
but
are
in
the
background
hops
have
a
floral
aroma
to
them
first
thing
i
notice
from
the
flavor
is
that
the
hops
are
not
as
big
as
i
thought
based
on
the
aroma
or
at
least
give
a
different
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
still
pretty
big
malt
flavor
seems
to
be
a
bit
hard
to
pinpoint
but
give
a
caramel
feel
slight
alcohol
flavor
is
there
but
well
hidden
this
was
a
very
nice
brew
hops
are
big
malts
are
big
though
they
get
muted
by
the
hops
drinks
easy
has
a
nice
warming
feel
great
sipping
brew
would
get
this
one
again
a
fantastic
beer
that
rides
the
line
between
stronger
american
ales
and
imperial
ipas
thanks
stiggs
d
goes
down
easily
and
smoothly
i
will
definitely
try
this
one
again
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
hops
taste
is
very
hoppy
some
pine
definatly
way
to
bitter
for
my
liking
feels
bitter
in
the
mouth
and
1
of
these
was
enough
for
me
overall
if
you
are
into
hop
bombs
this
may
be
for
you
otherwise
avoid
it
d
this
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
and
level
of
hoppiness
not
too
hot
or
bitter
definitely
worth
a
try
pours
a
surprisingly
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
big
tan
head
that
sticks
in
sporadic
slowly
dripping
sheets
highly
balanced
aroma
fresh
sticky
hop
flowers
melding
with
sweet
dark
roasty
goodness
chocolate
tea
lemon
honey
and
pine
all
working
together
a
continuation
of
balance
in
the
flavor
a
dark
and
bitter
creation
showcasing
the
resiny
pine
and
grapefruit
pucker
of
the
hops
as
well
as
a
rich
and
dark
caramel
malt
base
the
hops
coat
everything
in
the
end
and
i
like
that
its
fairly
thick
and
a
good
blast
of
flavor
but
im
craving
another
so
its
not
too
much
to
handle
at
all
very
tasty
and
well
made
east
coast
style
not
gonna
end
your
night
weigh
you
down
or
kill
your
palette
d
a
good
beer
but
the
woodsiness
of
this
beer
become
more
prevalent
as
it
warms
not
really
a
beer
i
would
choose
to
try
again
drinkability
is
alright
it
is
a
good
beer
but
i
might
only
want
one
at
a
time
overall
this
is
a
completely
unbalanced
hop
bomb
but
its
fun
it
is
drinkable
though
with
a
noticeable
bitter
dominance
coming
in
towards
the
end
of
the
warmer
glass
d
a
really
well
made
beer
and
very
pleasing
to
drink
a
touch
boozy
alcohol
is
well
masked
and
no
issues
with
drinkability
here
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
on
the
hop
profile
and
was
disappointed
from
that
aspect
but
overall
a
very
decent
beer
the
alcohol
is
pretty
wellhidden
on
the
palate
but
seems
to
show
through
in
the
head
perhaps
a
bit
of
exhaustion
is
helping
it
along
though
either
way
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
will
very
happily
enjoy
but
not
more
than
once
in
a
sitting
delicious
but
a
bit
of
a
palatedestroyer
for
sure
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
though
provoking
beer
all
the
way
around
from
the
fine
folks
at
victory
i
would
gladly
welcome
again
but
im
not
sure
i
could
handle
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
given
its
overall
aggressiveness
dthis
is
certainly
a
well
made
beer
but
the
flavors
just
didnt
come
together
for
me
i
found
it
to
be
too
harsh
and
raw
not
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
the
cask
version
i
had
when
it
was
first
made
was
much
better
many
thanks
to
victory
brewing
co
for
a
another
tasty
beer
the
abv
hits
me
with
this
brew
ive
tried
it
several
times
each
time
i
felt
this
rather
quickly
might
be
hard
to
do
more
than
2
of
these
doesnt
disappoint
but
a
little
age
on
this
might
do
some
wonders
to
it
tried
it
on
draft
missed
the
cask
by
10
minutes
at
victory
as
well
and
i
dont
remember
the
finish
being
quite
this
hot
d
a
wonderfully
tasty
strong
ale
as
always
victory
doesnt
disappoint
drinkability
not
too
bad
i
would
gladly
sip
through
a
couple
in
a
night
glad
i
got
a
few
of
these
though
as
im
going
to
throw
them
in
the
closet
and
forget
about
them
and
see
if
the
hops
fade
out
a
bit
and
give
the
malts
more
of
a
chance
to
develop
in
the
flavor
and
potentially
smooth
out
some
of
the
alcohol
in
it
very
drinkable
to
be
so
dark
drinkability
a
very
tasty
offering
from
victory
very
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
of
hops
and
a
nice
belgian
quality
to
it
complex
enough
to
make
you
think
yet
not
overdone
making
this
beer
one
that
you
can
enjoy
all
night
long
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
d
an
extremely
drinkable
american
strong
ale
pours
a
clear
amberdark
red
color
with
a
finger
of
very
yellow
stained
head
there
are
faint
particles
of
yeast
stuck
in
suspension
despite
a
very
careful
pour
nose
reeks
of
spice
and
pine
hops
in
the
background
of
the
nose
there
is
a
bit
of
grain
and
alcohol
taste
is
spiced
hop
bitterness
upfront
with
a
bit
of
toasted
grain
about
the
profile
as
well
lingering
oil
like
hop
bitterness
is
left
in
the
mouth
yeast
and
warming
alcohol
notes
play
quite
a
part
in
the
flavor
as
well
it
is
a
medium
feel
beer
with
mild
carbination
drinkability
is
fair
for
a
beer
that
is
still
quite
fresh
and
hot
i
will
gladly
enjoy
a
few
more
before
setting
some
in
the
cellar
to
see
what
some
time
does
to
these
a
a
solid
two
inches
of
frothy
head
on
a
hard
pour
tons
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
as
the
beer
settles
to
a
meringuelike
top
the
color
reminds
me
of
a
dark
iced
tea
4

s
nose
is
much
more
subdued
than
i
expected
though
as
the
beer
warms
it
becomes
more
prevalent
some
faint
sweetness
and
earthy
grain
almost
a
hint
of
mint
andor
grass
coupled
with
some
orange
aromas

t
the
palate
packs
a
solid
punch
of
bitter
hops
and
specialty
malts
the
hops
are
green
and
with
a
prominent
grassy
finish
i
get
a
good
deal
of
coffee
caramel
and
nuts
along
with
a
slight
warming
from
the
alcohol
there
is
also
a
soft
sweetness
that
reminds
me
of
raisins
the
hops
seem
to
provide
some
pine
sap
to
the
mix
4

smooth
and
quite
creamy

d
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable

interesting
union

i

gladly
enjoy
again

the
brews
flavor
has
quite
a
levels
of
complexities
to
it
a
molasses
perhaps
cardamon
flavor
steps
up
first
with
some
toasted
bread
right
behind
it
very
piney
hops
quickly
follow
it
pushing
the
oomph
factor
up
a
bit
more
its
almost
along
the
lines
of
an
ipa
but
theres
a
dark
fruit
thing
instead
of
grapefruit
and
pine
that
those
usually
carry
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
i
am
tasting
but
it
is
tasting
very
interesting
and
quite
good
the
finish
then
throws
in
another
curveball
in
the
taste
with
a
ginger
hotness
chocolate
notes
and
rye
the
mouthfeel
is
full
yet
bubbly
and
has
quite
a
chewiness
to
it
d
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
im
really
enjoying
its
easy
to
drink
this
one
too
fast
if
you
like
hops
this
a
beer
to
look
for
d
this
is
a
great
beer
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
and
more
specifically
hop
devil
but
with
darker
more
prominent
malts
until
i
saw
the
classification
on
this
site
i
thought
this
was
an
ipa
drinks
really
well
and
balanced
but
watch
that
abv
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
9ish
beer
yakima
twilight
was
jumped
to
the
top
of
my
favorites
from
victory
while
a
bit
to
strong
to
be
sessionable
i
would
not
mind
have
a
few
in
a
sitting
outstanding
balance
with
strong
pleasant
flavors
highly
recommended
not
too
bad
but
not
as
good
as
victorys
other
hop
bombs
the
crazy
foaming
and
malt
base
that
doesnt
add
much
hurt
this
one
in
my
eyes
oh
well
i
still
love
hopdevil
the
drink
is
fullbodied
with
fine
and
proportional
carbonation
a
highquality
sipper
from
victory
d
the
intense
bitterness
limits
the
drinkability
and
the
flavor
though
nice
is
not
all
that
interesting
or
complex
cheers
d
pretty
good
overall
beer
could
probably
use
a
little
bit
more
body
seems
a
little
thin
for
the
strength
it
is
good
overall
flavors
almost
and
imperial
brown
ale
alcohol
shows
its
presence
but
this
doesnt
feel
like
an
8
7
beer
pretty
smooth
for
what
it
is
a
couple
in
a
session
is
quite
possible
thought
i
mised
out
on
this
one
glad
to
come
across
this
accidentally
at
the
local
beer
store
the
beer
has
a
moderate
body
perhaps
a
bit
light
for
its
high
strength
and
sweetness
the
moderate
level
of
carbonation
might
help
with
that
this
beer
really
grew
on
me
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
by
the
second
glass
i
really
liked
it
id
recommend
it
but
dont
expect
it
to
be
as
hop
forward
as
the
name
and
label
suggest
i
like
victory
brewing
prima
pils
storm
king
whirlwind
theyre
all
great
however
i
am
disappointed
in
this
brew
i
taste
a
giant
load
of
centennial
with
too
much
300
lovibond
malt
i
want
to
say
roasted
barley
but
chocolate
surprises
me
sometimes
at
the
roastiness
parhaps
sopme
black
patent
anyways
a
miss
for
my
palate
but
others
seem
to
like
it
and
i
would
say
that
a
little
less
roasty
more
toasty
with
a
better
hop
bill
would
make
this
beer
an
a
for
me
i
love
the
concept

the
beer
certainly
displays
its
strength
through
the
alcohol
in
the
back
you

black

could
become
a

staple
overall
a
very
good
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
the
dark

but
i
liked
it
overall
another
winner
from
st
will
definitely
be
getting
again
o
i
love
black
ales
and
lagers
unfortunately
i
dont
see
enough
of
them
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
overall
this
is
one
heck
of
a
beer
if
you
see
this
one
and
dont
buy
it
you
are
wrong
and
hurting
no
one
but
yourself
overall
not
as
bitter
as
i
might
like
and
very
floral
for
something
so
masculine
surprisingly
crisp
might
not
seek
it
out
apurpose
but
tasty
never
the
less
i
might
prefer
something
less
floral
and
acidic
and
a
bit
more
bitter
not
bad
but
not
great
disappointing
pours
a
dark
black
with
a
nice
light
head
the
smell
was
very
light
and
citrus
in
contrast
to
the
color
a
lot
of
floral
and
citrus
notes
the
taste
was
very
nice
a
clean
finish
that
was
very
refreshing
while
having
a
good
body
and
flavor
to
go
along
with
it
i
found
a
lot
of
orange
flavor
to
it
the
only
thing
i
would
have
liked
was
more
malt
to
give
more
flavor
on
the
end
and
give
it
a
bit
thicker
body
this
black
ale
pours
a
very
near
black
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
leaves
beautiful
silky
lacing
the
nose
is
shockingly
malty
and
one
note
all
roasted
malt
and
little
to
nothing
else
the
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
and
smooth
and
creamy
the
flavor
is
much
better
than
the
nose
with
some
hops
chocolate
coffee
and
dried
fruit
added
to
the
roasted
malt
character
it
is
still
quite
sweet
for
the
style
im
not
sure
if
i
just
have
a
bottle
that
is
slightly
past
its
prime
or
if
this
is
what
the
brewer
was
going
for
it
is
far
maltier
than
most
of
the
american
black
ales
ive
had
more
reminiscent
of
a
dopplebock
or
a
belgian
dark
ale
id
really
like
to
try
a
bottle
of
this
that
i
knew
was
fresh
to
see
if
this
was
the
intention
or
just
a
victim
of
time
good
none
the
less
prosit
1644
taste
throughout
is
a
mix
of
roasted
malt
and
pine
burnt
bitter
aftertaste
but
enough
sweetness
to
not
be
overwhelming
carbonation
is
medium
with
an
average
body
o
this
black
ale
is
deep
without
being
rude
tons
of
flavor
and
feel
from
the
dark
side
roasted
malts
mingling
with
a
bitter
hop
backbone
makes
for
an
interesting
conversation
and
that
aint
no
lie
good
sippin
brew
but
could
fill
you
up
enjoyable
interesting
beer
that
i
feel
i
could
easily
pick
out
of
a
line
up
of
black
ales
that
tanginess
is
unmistakable
for
all
i
know
this
beer
is
mildy
infected
but
whether
it
is
or
isnt
that
little
sort
of
funk
is
more
than
welcome
bursting
with
resinous
hops
a
roasty
character
on
the
finish
alcohol
thats
not
shy
to
show
itself
a
very
interesting
enjoyable
beer
well
worth
the
2
49
because
this
was
an
experience
worth
having
would
have
it
again
for
sure
maybe
its
possible
i
got
a
bad
bottle
there
was
something
a
little
off
with
the
smell
and
then
at
the
initial
taste
this
quite
offputting
heavy
alcohol
aroma
hits
completely
ruins
this
otherwisegood
beer
for
me
but
again
with
people
praising
this
beer
and
rating
it
so
highly
ill
have
to
try
it
again
and
adjust
my
review
but
until
then
i
have
to
rate
it
poorly
o
a
really
well
executed
and
surprisingly
balanced
take
on
an
american
black
ale
i
could
definitely
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
again
in
the
not
too
distant
future
would
i
buy
it
again
definitely
im
impressed
with
this
beer
and
would
buy
it
again
this
is
a
great
beer
its
appearance
and
smell
werent
anything
special
but
it
had
a
thick
and
rich
mouthfeel
and
its
taste
was
rich
and
full
there
wasnt
any
chalky
or
metallic
taste
and
it
hid
its
high
alcohol
content
well
overall
this
is
really
nice
stuff
plenty
of
flavour
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
interest
too
very
happy
a
really
good
beer
from
southern
tier
o
a
great
brew
for
drinkability
with
the
flavor
of
a
black
ale
will
definitely
be
buying
another
one
of
these
bad
boys
overy
much
enjoyed
this
one
drinkable
by
full
of
flavor
nice
twist
on
a
traditional
black
ale
the
rest
i
really
like
this
beer
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
for
an
imperial
and
it
doesnt
have
that
syrupy
mouthcoating
quality
you
sometimes
find
in
imperials
but
it
has
a
nice
layering
of
flavors
with
maybe
the
alcohol
showing
up
a
bit
too
much
overall
very
good
o
this
is
a
delicious
black
ale
with
strong
similarities
to
its
german
lager
cousin
othis
beer
has
the
taste
and
the
aftertaste
ans
was
a
great
beer
the
beer
poured
very
well
with
good
viscosity
and
a
nice
thick
head
the
smell
was
our
favorite
aspect
as
it
sniffed
very
very
well
the
taste
was
good
but
had
a
pretty
harsh
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
good
and
overall
was
a
very
good
imperial
black
ale
i
would
recommend
anyone
to
that
hasnt
tried
and
imperial
black
ale
before
as
its
much
easier
on
the
palate
the
limited
amount
of
head
is
minute
but
last
for
an
extended
period
of
time
roasted
and
phonolic
aroma
flavor
is
a
bit
alcoholic
warming
to
the
throat
and
cleanly
roasted
maybe
a
little
raisin
flavor
too
a
good
solid
black
ale
no
messing
around
not
super
fancy
solid
enjoyable
luxurrious
o
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
thought
the
booziness
somewhat
eclipsed
the
more
subtle
elements
perhaps
apt
given
the
name
decent
beer
but
i
expected
more
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
i
would
try
it
again
overall
this
is
a
rather
tasty
brew
if
looking
for
something
decently
hoppy
moderately
sweet
and
roasty
this
is
a
good
brew
to
try
overall
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
its
more
amazing
than
i
remembered
its
a
great
midwinter
beer
for
hop
lovers
to
me
the
darker
flavours
are
so
integral
to
the
success
of
a
black
ale
this
seems
more
like
an
ipa
that
happens
to
look
dark
and
even
then
its
a
bit
flighty
and
fruity
and
lacking
in
gravitas
cant
say
i
love
it
this
is
a
big
drink
but
its
not
overwhelming
you
dont
necessarily
feel
the
need
to
have
to
slow
down
and
sip
you
do
it
because
its
very
enjoyable
i
had
a
bit
of
trouble
figuring
out
particular
hints
that
i
noticed
with
each
smell
and
taste
the
pepper
and
alcohol
were
the
first
things
to
come
to
mind
but
its
not
as
if
they
dominated
the
taste
i
couldnt
quite
place
much
more
i
noticed
a
sweet
vanilla
hint
in
the
smell
and
it
seems
like
there
was
a
grape
taste
present
of
course
i
didnt
want
to
get
totally
lost
in
figuring
out
what
the
smells
and
tastes
were
and
forget
to
enjoy
it
the
sum
of
the
parts
make
this
a
great
brew
i
will
get
this
again
there
are
so
many
great
black
cascadian
ales
out
there
and
this
is
not
my
favorite
i
think
the
molasses
flavor
is
a
little
much
for
the
style
and
the
hops
flavors
are
good
but
just
not
quite
what
i
want
but
this
is
just
quibbling
this
is
a
great
beer
o
overall
i
think
that
this
was
one
heck
of
a
great
ale
and
more
than
deserving
of
its
present
rating
of
92
this
beer
had
an
incredible
balance
of
hops
bitterness
and
malt
i
will
definitely
buy
it
again
o
very
enjoyable
take
on
the
style
i
will
get
this
one
again
anyway
bottom
line
is
its
a
solid
black
ale
i
still
like
hop
in
the
dark
and
certain
others
better
and
im
glad
this
wasnt
any
more
expensive
than
it
was
but
its
still
quite
an
enjoyable
drinking
experience
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
reminds
me
of
anger
which
i
have
much
more
frequently
than
this
one
although
this
is
a
little
bit
bigger
pours
black
with
a
ruby
undertone
two
fingers
of
sturdy
foam
from
a
vigorous
pour
that
fell
unwillingly
to
some
sticky
lacing
nose
is
muted
dark
fruits
citrus
hops
and
roasted
malt
thats
a
little
burnt
the
forward
hop
nose
is
contrast
to
the
dark
color
as
it
warms
the
malt
comes
forward
even
more
a
little
coffee
more
earthy
hops
and
slightly
boozy
first
taste
is
a
surprise
i
expected
very
sweet
but
what
i
got
was
smooth
burned
toast
and
bitter
the
chocolate
comes
out
a
little
and
the
alcohol
is
warming
it
finishes
big
and
heavy
bittersweet
and
smoky
well
made
too
highly
carbonated
overall
its
a
quality
beer
made
with
real
skill
but
falls
short
due
to
southern
tiers
sweetness
problem
this
is
where
personal
preference
comes
into
play
someone
who
likes
a
nice
barleywine
or
quad
will
love
this
but
those
of
us
who
love
crisp
pilsners
and
dry
stouts
will
feel
compelled
to
brush
out
teeth
afterwards
i
havent
had
a
black
ipa
i
enjoyed
this
much
since
stones
15th
anniversary
ale
i
should
have
had
this
a
little
fresher
but
it
should
hold
up
well
given
the
thick
malts
and
high
abv
however
the
earthy
flavors
are
a
plus
here
and
its
all
owed
to
the
dank
yet
vibrant
hop
profile
cant
wait
to
try
more
beers
from
these
guys
o
outstanding
beer
always
a
delight
to
have
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tulip
pours
a
deep
dark
color
of
charred
wood
and
allowing
just
the
faintest
amount
of
light
through
its
belly
the
head
is
big
two
to
three
fingers
high
and
cloudlike
there
is
lacing
all
over
the
glass
as
the
beer
disappears
the
nose
is
a
huge
citrus
hop
blossom
there
are
all
the
usual
offenders
of
bright
oranges
grapefruit
lime
and
citrus
zest
the
black
malts
impart
the
very
faintest
of
a
hersey
chocolate
bar
but
gives
much
ground
to
the
dry
hop
additions
the
taste
is
incredibly
smooth
the
hops
take
all
of
the
glory
of
this
show
and
have
all
the
fresh
orange
zest
fresh
oranges
just
a
lot
of
orange
flavor
all
over
the
place
there
is
a
good
bitter
profile
to
the
beer
but
in
no
way
astringent
or
overbearing
the
malt
gives
good
backbone
to
the
beer
and
the
creamy
and
roasty
characteristics
of
a
good
black
malt
without
any
of
the
sometimes
bitter
component
that
comes
across
unnatural
to
some
black
ipas
the
mouthfeel
shows
none
of
the
9
abv
and
has
good
body
my
only
complaint
would
be
a
little
bit
of
a
syrupy
feel
at
times
notwithstanding
this
beer
is
a
fabulous
black
ipa
that
really
features
the
late
hop
additions
and
pulls
off
a
wonderfully
balanced
beer
not
exactly
my
favorite
variation
on
the
style
but
still
definitely
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
o
this
kinda
reminded
me
of
three
floyds
black
sun
and
blot
out
the
sun
awesome
beers
not
to
mention
this
one
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
one
to
pick
up
should
you
come
across
it
othis
is
one
of
the
best
black
ales
i
have
had
so
far
great
mix
of
flavors
and
nice
balance
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
offering
and
is
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
overall
this
brew
is
quite
nice
there
is
a
good
dark
malt
sweetness
and
roast
but
the
hops
shine
together
with
these
malty
notes
pretty
delicious
aba
o
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
between
the
maltshops
and
sweetnessbitterness
but
that
disappointed
me
a
little
bit
since
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
bitterness
due
to
this
being
a
black
ipa
the
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
some
slight
hints
of
barleywine
notes
to
it
o
extremely
wellbalanced
beer
the
roasted
malts
and
hops
combine
to
make
a
delicious
bittersweet
combination
i
love
the
coffee
flavor
which
breaks
through
the
9
abv
is
hidden
well
beneath
all
the
complex
flavors
very
well
done
i
would
recommend
o
it
was
just
a
decent
black
ale
i
cant
seem
to
understand
the
high
score
it
has
received
in
the
past
definitely
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
think
that
beer
should
give
us
a
fizz
a
feeling
of
contentness
an
appreciation
of
what
were
putting
into
our
body
something
to
make
us
think
to
bring
us
to
a
better
place
this
beer
seriously
lacks
a
fizz
for
me
both
physically
and
mentally
cheers
another
great
beer
from
southern
tier
im
increasingly
impressed
with
this
brewery
this
beer
is
an
alcohol
bomb
but
it
is
well
hidden
other
than
a
deep
warming
sensation
the
color
is
a
rich
brown
color
very
deep
with
a
thin
tan
head
the
aroma
is
intense
brown
sugar
molasses
burnt
grain
husks
toasted
bread
crust
malt
and
booze
not
much
hop
aroma
although
there
is
a
bitterness
and
and
a
hop
bite
in
the
taste
smooth
and
warming
some
fruit
in
the
flavor
lingering
boozy
sensation
on
the
tongue
balanced
drinkable
dangerous
and
brilliant
poured
bomber
into
34oz
mug
deep
brownblack
that
shows
brownruby
in
the
light
smell
is
hops
like
an
ipa
but
with
a
strong
malt
backbone
taste
is
hops
at
first
but
the
expected
bitter
finish
is
obliterated
by
malt
and
sweet
chocolate
finishes
wet
and
sweet
and
delicious
alcohol
is
hidden
entirely
by
the
sweetness
as
is
the
hop
bitterness
that
would
normally
come
at
the
end
of
a
beer
that
smells
like
this
one
mouthfeel
is
creamy
without
being
too
heavy
overall
this
beer
is
a
couple
different
styles
and
no
style
at
all
a
delicious
abomination
as
many
have
said
o
great
twist
on
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
typically
prefer
a
black
ipa
that
is
very
hop
forward
and
hide
the
fact
that
it
is
black
in
color
but
this
beer
reminded
me
of
some
great
ipas
that
can
feature
a
great
malt
bill
inside
a
hoppy
beer
malt
stood
up
in
the
smell
in
the
flavor
and
in
its
mouthfeel
in
its
flavor
it
might
have
been
a
little
to
malt
forward
little
bit
of
sweetness
was
a
negative
but
all
around
a
cool
black
ipa
and
an
imperial
one
at
that
i
cant
recommend
it
enough
overall
wow
nice
darkblack
ale
great
roast
presence
and
smooth
flavor
presence
backed
up
with
tasty
but
not
overpowering
hop
presence
and
bitterness
the
brew
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
want
a
lot
more
of
this
another
excellent
job
from
southern
tier
oda
perplexing
brew
i
was
not
a
big
fan
i
enjoyed
its
individuality
it
doesnt
suit
me
well
the
large
format
souther
tier
brews
are
not
my
favorite
way
to
spend
8
to
9
dollars
its
been
a
few
years
since
ive
had
this
one
i
remembered
enjoying
it
much
more
but
this
isnt
as
complex
as
alot
of
the
big
black
ipas
coming
out
these
days
decent
big
beer
but
one
note
and
boring
its
not
exactly
worth
the
price
of
admission
in
my
opinion
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
the
best
for
the
style
seems
pretty
average
but
maybe
it
was
a
bad
batch
or
something
o
great
example
of
a
black
ipa
the
smooth
fluffy
body
of
a
stout
with
the
fullhop
flavored
hop
presence
had
high
hopes
for
this
beer
didnt
exactly
live
up
to
the
lofty
standards
being
a
rare
albeit
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
was
expecting
a
nice
smoky
charred
hoppy
taste
the
hops
are
there
but
also
just
a
cloying
sweetness
and
not
enough
balance
for
my
liking
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
and
probably
above
average
but
if
im
spending
7
on
a
bomber
i
want
superb
taste
with
complexity
and
balance
and
i
didnt
feel
i
got
that
with
this
one
also
too
much
of
a
boozy
aftertaste
even
for
the
high
abv
oa
very
well
balanced
brew
loved
this
beer
very
unique
and

who
enjoys
dark
beers
good
call
by
southern
tier
putting
this
beauty
in
regular
bottles
overall
now
this
is
a
big
beer
done
well
never
overly
pretentious
it
walks
a
perilously
thin
line
between
a
hoppedup
ipa
and
a
refined
belgian
strong
dark
ale
or
quadrupel
this
dance
could
have
gone
so
wrong
in
so
many
ways
but
it
works
flavors
are
perfectly
balanced
with
every
sip
bringing
new
appreciation
for
the
subtle
complexity
containing
within
the
murky
depths
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
that
is
certainly
worth
trying
have
gotten
a
few
times
and
not
been
let
down
liking
the
new
12oz
bottle
to
make
this
easier
to
enjoy
i
like
the
bottled
version
of
this
offering
a
bit
better
than
the
ontap
version
there
is
more
body
to
the
beer
and
the
hop
flavors
are
more
distinct
o
this
is
an
outstanding
imperial
ale
it
really
seems
to
fall
somewhere
in
between
an
imperial
ale
and
a
barley
wine
this
will
really
please
fans
of
malt
centered
beers
a
very
unique

pours

pine
sweet
molasses
like
flavor
with
some
piney

bite
mixed

me
from
identifying
any
one
flavor
this
was
sweet
but
relatively
light
slick
on
the
palate
with
plenty
of
carbonation
candy

flavor

not
cloying

this
is
an
absolutely
fantastic

plenty

balancing
out
the

which
is
what
i
really
like
in

into
my
trusty

kind
of
a
brownish
hue
with
decent
head
tastes
of
toffee
and
chocolate
and
the
smell
is
the
same
as
it
tastes
strong
enough
to
have
a
couple
of
these
at
a
time
though
smooth
tasting
a
great
filling
o
i
liked
this
beer
and
its
true
to
the
style
perhaps
it
isnt
as
complex
and
big
as
say
the
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
but
it
surely
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
9
beers
out
there
recommended
overall
wow
this
is

always
thought
southern

beers
were
far
over
the
top
with
the

of
the
beer
mokah
jah
va
etc
but
this
is
killer
with
balance
flavor
and
smoothness
hands
down
the
best
black
ale
ive
ever
had
and
untill
i
find
it
this
gets
a

subtle

im
drinking
this
way
too
fast
first
experience
with
southern
tier
definitely
keeping
an
eye
out
for
their
stuff
in
the
future
overall
this
is
easily
recommendable
and
another
stellar
addition
to
the
southern
tier
name
overall
my
impression
of
this
experiment
is
positive
ive
had
trouble
with
black
alescdas
and
others
most
closely
related
to
the
style
now
an
imperial
version
it
seems
to
agree
with
me
as
i
cant
really
find
anything
that
doesnt
agree
with
me
in
a
big
way
good
thing
i
have
only
one
bomber
good
stuff
here
yes
i
will
have
this
one
again
overall
a
very
solid
black
ale
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
brown
highlights
and
a
sparse
ring
of
film
around
the
edge
of
the
surface
aromas
are
malty
and
roasted
with
hints
of
fig
and
coffee
flavors
are
rich
and
robust
on
a
light
crisp
body
coffee
roast
dark
chocolate
and
dark
old
world
fruits
such
as
fig
and
date
the
increased
carbonation
and
the
thinner
body
keep
everything
light
and
lead
to
a
quick
finish
there
is
minimal
cling
along
the
glass
and
the
aftertaste
is
light
and
quick
with
some
roast
coffee
flavors
very
easy
to
drink
tasty
little
beer
o
o
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
this
style
of
beer
this
is
a
good
one
to
try
its
perfectly
balanced
and
is
truly
a
prime
example
of
what
this
style
of
beer
can
and
should
be
o
very
enjoyable
and
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
o
very
well
balanced
offering
which
exemplifies
the
style
perfect
blend
of
hoppy
ipa
character
and
dark
smoky
malts
of
a
porter
well
done
southern
tier
overall
good
black
ipa
the
mouthfeel
is
really
what
saves
it
to
make
it
an
above
average
beer
an
exceptional
offering
from
southern
tier
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
i
will
definitely
look
for
again
a
remarkably
well
balanced
brew
good
stuff
overall
impression
i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
with
anything
from
southern
tier
this
is
a
very
good
bipa
unlike
other
posers
the
malts
are
roasted
enough
to
justify
the
black
ipa
i
have
had
too
many
bipas
that
taste
like
an
ordinary
ipa
way
to
go
sourthern
tier
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
because
the
hop
bitterness
is
well
balanced
by
the
underlying
malts
overall
impression
more
ipalike
than
anything
else
another
winner
from
st
seek
out
and
enjoy
overall
a
good
enjoyable
beer
one
id
like
to
have
again
its
only
real
downside
is
too
much
alcohol
flavor
feel
and
even
smell
at
certain
moments
but
at
least
thats
not
overwhelming
o
incredibly
drinkable
with
a
great
flavor
profile
o
a
very
good
beer
it
would
go
very
will
with
roast
beef
or
pork
overall
it
is
pretty
good
black
ipa
you
get
the
mix
of
ipa
and
porter
tastes
there
is
coffee
and
some
hoppiness
neither
flavor
overwhelms
the
other
pretty
good
for
balance
i
recommend
picking
up
a
bomber
or
a
growler
to
enjoy
this
beer
by
southern
tier
overall
fantastic
beer
will
definitely
get
again
overall
i
am
happy
with
this
brew
id
get
another
pours
a
very
dark
nearly
black
color
with
an
initially
thick
and
creamy
head
that
slips
down
to
a
thin
bubbly
covering
dark
caramel
malt
toasty
wood
tobacco
and
a
smooth
booziness
hits
the
nostrils
first
orange
and
citrus
blossom
hoppiness
meets
some
pine
and
light
lemon
the
flavor
is
good
balance
between
dark
malts
and
sticky
hops
chocolate
spruce
sweet
black
tea
raisin
and
some
trailing
citrus
and
mint
not
quite
full
bodied
but
creamy
and
fairly
well
carbonated
pretty
good
all
around
the
hops
are
still
tasty
and
the
balance
is
nice
but
something
makes
me
question
the
freshness
of
this
bottle
it
should
be
fresh
considering
it
came
from
a
fairly
new
store
but
i
detect
a
certain
aged
quality
worthy
of
a
revisit
in
the
near
future
incidentally
the
label
depicts
a
hexigram
talisman
a
fivepointed
image
to
invoke
good
luck
while
representing
brewing
purity
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
suspect
any
discerning
ba
would
as
well
o
i
have
always
like
this
beer
but
this
is
the
first
time
reviewing
it
the
mixture
of
sweet
roasted
malt
and
hop
is
perfect
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
in
this
new
and
blossoming
style
of
beer
it
is
much
more
deserving
of
the
ipa
tag
that
adorns
the
bottle
than
many
of
the
participating
breweries
it
tastes
and
drinks
more
like
a
session
ipa
than
a
higher
gravity
black
ipa
i
will
buy
again
very
soon
this
beer
almost
reminds
me
of
a
light
barlywine
it
has
a
nice
balance
between
lots
of
malt
and
lots
of
hops
very
tasty
a
great
must
try
beer
disappointed
i
expected
more
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
but
nothing
special
its
not
one
id
prefer
to
have
more
than
one
of
o
theres
a
lot
going
on
here
and
the
multiple
layered
flavors
make
this
a
true
blend
of
an
ipa
with
a
darker
beer
well
not
quite
black
but
close
a
dark
clear
cola
with
a
dark
off
white
head
that
does
not
want
to
go
away
scads
of
lace
and
just
a
joy
to
behold
nose
is
full
of
roasted
grains
light
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
waft
back
and
forth
with
a
lovely
caramel
sweetness
this
is
so
good
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
a
brown
bread
malt
core
that
envelopes
a
yeasty
fruitiness
bringing
forth
some
faint
plum
and
figs
no
trace
of
the
alcohol
anywhere
wow
finish
is
crisp
with
a
good
earthy
hops
that
has
a
firm
but
mild
grapefruit
bitterness
feel
is
supple
and
mediumish
with
a
touch
of
light
syrup
carbonation
is
lightly
creamy
and
super
fine
this
stuff
goes
down
like
a
lager
and
is
so
delicious
that
you
need
a
plate
of
good
food
too
keep
you
from
getting
in
trouble
a
stupendous
beer
for
some
reason
likely
my
own
preconceptions
i
was
expecting
a
beer
called
an
imperial
black
ale
to
be
more
akin
to
the
new
black
ipa
and
it
sort
of
is
if
you
dont
mind
a
malt
bomb
as
an
ipa
i
dont
necessary
and
quite
enjoyed
this
but
the
hops
are
very
subdued
and
someone
looking
for
a
more
hopped
up
black
ale
may
be
disappointed
i
like
it
and
think
its
really
good
o
it
really
is
the
antithesis
of
unearthly
this
beer
is
a
complete
mess
but
in
a
good
way
its
even
weirder
than
other
black
ipas
ive
had
its
not
as
well
balanced
yet
its
still
enjoyable
its
really
hard
to
grade
this
brew
technically
it
isnt
a
well
done
beer
but
i
like
it
however
the
stone
escondidian
is
a
better
example
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
interesting
drink
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
like
a
schwartzbier
but
it
was
advertised
on
the
bottle
as
a
black
ipa
but
it
was
neither
and
very
enjoyable
overall
this
one
is
a
winner
the
bottle
claims
that
it
is
the
antithesis
of
unearthly
and
i
would
like
to
try
them
side
by
side
i
find
this
easy
to
drink
and
do
not
taste
the
alcohol
a
very
nice
beer
overall
that
went
down
easy
and
was
highly
drinkable
definitely
check
this
out
definitely
worth
trying
i
will
if
i
can
procure
a
fresher
bottling
do
for
a
big
black
ipa
this
beer
is
fairly
palatefriendly
flavors
are
balanced
with
just
a
slight
edge
given
to
the
layered
dark
malt
qualities
over
hop
influences
it
is
notably
similar
to
stones
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
a
beer
that
arguably
founded
the
imperial
black
ipa
substyle
pours
a
super
dark
black
into
my
snifter
glass
decent
carbonation
and
excellent
lacing
a
little
thinner
looking
than
i
would
expect
for
the
style
but
the
color
is
right
on
head
was
half
a
finger
cocoa
in
color
it
quickly
disappears
nose
is
really
nice
bordering
on
fantastic
the
c
hops
are
here
as
well
as
malt
grapefruit
and
caramel
very
smooth
and
balanced
nose
taste
is
really
nice
as
well
nice
malthopscaramelchocolatefruit
vibe
definitely
balanced
and
a
smooth
easy
drinker
the
feel
on
this
beer
is
excellent
very
creamy
smooth
and
somewhat
dry
just
about
perfect
for
the
style
the
9
abv
is
completely
absent
from
this
beer
as
well
im
not
sure
where
they
hid
it
but
i
dont
even
get
a
whiff
or
taste
of
alcohol
at
all
totally
stealth
overall
this
is
a
nice
brew
that
deserves
a
pick
up
if
you
havent
had
it
i
enjoyed
it
cheers
good
stuff
thanks
to
wilkins44
for
this
there
is
an
off
taste
or
something
it
doesnt
really
affect
my
opinion
though
and
i
would
have
another
no
problem
overall
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
but
it
entered
a
style
that
is
dominated
by
extraordinary
beers
like
ssr
stone
15th
anniversary
and
hop
in
the
dark
it
is
good
but
doesnt
come
close
to
measuring
up
the
the
heavy
hitters
in
the
style
thanks
to
maxspang
for
the
bottle
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
from
southern
tier
and
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
ive
had
better
but
this
is
a
beer
worth
trying
from
a
brewery
that
helped
usher
me
into
craft
beer
cheers
o
a
very
sinister
and
barbaric
looking
drink
which
has
a
very
pleasing
and
smooth
taste
if
i
were
a
viking
i
would
drink
this
next
to
a
massive
victory
fire
on
a
cold
battle
ridden
night
i
will
definatly
have
another
o
so
so
wouldnt
purchase
this
again
i
love
southern
tiern
but
am
not
hip
on
this
particular
beer
i
love
it
its
a
favorite
and
its
perfect
for
my
wife
and
i
to
split
before
bed
overy
good
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
decent
hops
good
balanced
taste
this
beer
poured
out
nice
and
black
in
color
the
head
was
brownish
tan
and
left
behind
a
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
lots
of
chocolate
and
hop
aromas
pouring
out
of
this
one
the
taste
is
a
rich
and
loaded
with
flavorful
hop
and
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
thick
side
and
for
southern
tier
that
seems
to
be
something
that
their
imperials
never
lack
overall
this
brew
was
quite
tasty
id
really
like
to
revisit
this
one
someday
overall
the
taste
is
very
good
but
the
aroma
was
lacking
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
and
i
will
be
getting
this
one
again
22oz
poured
into
a
snifter
dark
brownish
black
ale
aroma
of
roasted
malts
dark
fruits
sugary
booze
and
floral
hops
in
the
taste
an
even
balance
of
roasted
malt
barleywine
like
heat
and
fruityness
and
a
small
piney
resiny
hop
profile
full
bodied
chewey
strong
brew
southern
tier
once
again
brews
an
extreme
beer
to
please
and
challenge
the
palate
solid
overall
great
beer
i
am
very
glad
i
have
two
bottles
of
this
this
is
a
pretty
decent
black
ale
i
like
how
the
hops
sort
of
sneak
up
on
you
its
not
at
all
a
black
hop
bomb
and
has
some
nice
layers
d
very
drinkable
the
roasted
and
burnt
flavors
balance
quite
well
with
the
hop
flavor
i
especially
like
the
coffee
flavor
that
comes
through
at
the
finish
overall
honestly
this
is
probably
one
of
my
least
favorite
black
ipas
or
abas
the
flavor
profile
is
just
an
absolute
mess
in
all
honesty
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
southern
tier
very
smoothdrinking
and
flavorful
nice
balance
between
the
roasty
sweet
and
hoppy
qualities
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
very
smooth
for
the
abv
i
could
use
more
hops
on
the
smell
and
taste
overall
for
the
style
this
example
has
its
own
unique
flavor
i
cant
seem
to
wrap
my
head
around
i
thought
the
mouthfeel
was
the
strong
point
as
well
as
the
hidden
octane
a
good
beer
overall
o
was
expecting
more
could
be
that
its
an
old
bottle
would
like
to
sample
it
very
fresh
it
just
seems
whats
going
on
doesnt
mesh
well
to
me
i
like
it
but
you
have
to
be
in
the
mood
for
it
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
but
maybe
the
style
gets
a
little
more
hype
than
is
necessary
maybe
overall
a
nice
experience
a
style
that
stands
on
its
own
for
having
lots
of
flavors
and
higher
abv
a
pretty
smooth
drinker
id
do
it
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
this
is
truly
a
genrebending
beer
as
well
as
a
firstclass
taste
experience
that
has
to
be
tried
to
be
believed
a
mustbuy
for
beer
afficionados
really
a
great
black
ipa
the
bottle
describes
it
as
the
antithesis
of
unearthly

on

and
i
try
to
rate
based
on
style
but
being
a
little
unfamiliar
i
may
have
to
come
back
and
rereview
this
one
to
give
it
a

well
blended
brew
smooth
taste
not
overpowering
for
a
9
abv
concoction
nice
finish
with
a
very
nice
aftertaste
this
was
my
first
one
wont
be
my
last
drink
this
brew
gets
a
bit
boozy
if
you
drink
indiscriminately
though
you
dont
necessarily
have
to
sip
to
enjoy
probably
best
to
split
the
22oz
with
a
friend
overall
not
the
best
black
ipa
that
i
have
had
i
prefer
more
of
a
pronounced
malt
character
to
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
hops
were
perfect
the
creamy
mouthfeel
made
this
an
easy
drinker
and
i
would
like
another
this
beer
is
dark
like
a
root
beerish
color
with
a
flat
tan
head
the
disapears
quickly
with
no
retention
around
the
glass
i
can
smell
sweet
malts
and
some
floral
hoppiness
the
taste
is
pretty
good
dark
fruits
and
choclate
but
i
get
a
hint
of
licorce
which
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
better
has
a
watery
mouthfeel
to
me
very
disappointing
to
me
i
wish
this
was
a
thicker
brew
this
is
one
dangerously
drinkable
9
dark
ale
that
is
pairing
nicely
with
some
fresh
smoky
gouda
drinks
good
for
the
abv
but
one
bottle
is
more
than
enough
a
good
beer
to
split
with
someone
due
to
its
high
abv
and
richness
overall
i
was
very
impressed
would
buy
again
i
bought
as
a
part
of
a
winter
mix
i
was
building
though
its
not
a
seasonal
winter
beer
it
sure
goes
well
with
it
mediumfull
body
with
a
bitter
sour
finish
bummer
we
give
it
a
solid
a
for
awesome
this
is
a
fantastic
abomination
of
a
beer
get
some
this
beer
is
awesome
i
havent
had
to
many
of
this
style
but
in
my
mind
this
is
what
i
expect
it
to
taste
like
i
liked
this
but
i
was
a
little
confused
by
the
style
is
it
an
ipa
with
the
hoppiness
was
it
a
porter
with
the
dark
roast
malts
or
was
it
something
else
with
the
lighter
body
lighter
than
expected
my
senses
were
not
calibrated
for
this
overall
incredible
brew
the
black
ipa
is
something
were
seeing
more
of
and
i
love
them

well
made
curious
how
would
taste
on
tap
and
would
drink
again
9
abv
and
you
wouldnt
even
know
it
easy
to
drink
and
not
to
harsh
overall
not
as
hoppy
as
i
wouldve
liked
but
maybe
i
bought
an
old
bottle
from
table
and
vine
ya
never
know
unless
they
date
um
mouthfeeldrinkability
a
nice
mediumtofull
mouthfeel
clings
to
the
palate
a
bit
with
all
of
the
strong
conflicting
flavors
in
this
beer
the
alcohol
is
easily
hidden
this
is
an
interesting
style
to
say
the
least
others
have
rated
this
beer
very
highly
so
if
youre
looking
to
try
a
black
ipa
i
would
certainly
pick
it
up
and
give
it
a
try
this
beer
just
isnt
for
me
pours
near
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
leaving
a
little
bit
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
in
your
face
with
a
strong
attack
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
atop
a
good
amount
of
stronglyroasted
malt
the
taste
is
pretty
good
in
its
balance
though
it
lacks
the
depth
and
interactions
of
the
nose
the
roast
comes
through
a
bit
more
here
the
dry
roast
and
hop
bitterness
combine
well
in
the
feel
quite
a
drinkable
brew
and
one
of
the
first
black
ipas
i
ever
came
across
not
quite
the
black
i
was
expectngstill
a
deep
deep

of
hops
going
on
the
carameltoffeeish
flavors
are
great
really
balances
well
against
the
hops
soft
almost
creamy
like
body
to
it
really
goes
down
easyalmost
too
much
so
damn
drinkable
and
a
dangerous
abv
to
boot
overall
a
big
and
bold
black
ipa
that
brings
the
flavor
the
flavors
of
this
style
are
too
good
to
be
set
within
such
a
high
abv
beer
i
would
love
to
see
more
of
this
style
in
a
57
5
abv
medium
this
one
is
still
worth
a
try
d
a
tasty
beer
and
easy
to
get
down
overall
id
probably
stop
at
one
but
its
a
pretty
easy
one
to
drink
d
starts
out
easy
drinking
but
starts
to
be
a
commitment
half
way
through
d
i
am
a
bit
turned
off
by
the
smell
of
this
beer
but
the
flavor
and
mouth
redeems
itself
if
i
am
to
compare
this
to
the
only
other
two
examples
of
a
black
ipa
that
ive
had
from
stone
and
deschutes
id
have
to
say
this
falls
in
third
its
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
one
that
would
probably
be
monster
on
tap
thanks
again
michael
for
a
very
interesting
brew
i
would
never
have
gotten
a
chance
to
try
otherwise
d
i
finished
the
bottle
would
definitely
drink
a
second
this
is
a
dangerous
beer
i
love
the
concept
of
an
overly
hopped
dark
beer
iba
is
just
great
this
goes
beyond
that
if
this
beer
hasnt
won
any
awards
its
because
they
havent
found
or
made
the
right
category
for
it
dthis
very
drinkable
i
wish
southern
tier
bottle
dated
i
also
wish
this
were
available
to
me
in
6
packs
of
12
oz
bottles
not
sure
why
they
call
it
iniquity
since
it
seems
to
hit
the
mark
quite
well
drinkability
is
pretty
good
despite
the
high
abv
d
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
the
flavor
is
somewhat
unconventional
but
i
like
it
i
would
drink
it
again
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
tulip
pours
a
dark
black
with
chocolate
milk
colored
head
very
easy
on
the
palate
was
expecting
a
little
more
hoppy
for
being
a
black
ipa
easy
to
drink
quickly
tastes
chocolatly
malty
more
like
a
stout
just
a
little
lighter
very
easily
to
get
down
esp
at
9
wow
i
am
impressed
not
just
with
iniquity
but
i
also
tried
the
creme
brulee
and
jah
vah
stouts
from
southern
tier
and
am
thouroughly
amazed
this
is
one
of
my
new
favorites
md
somewhat
aqueous
and
is
neither
dry
nor
sweet
at
least
it
is
drinkable
for
a
9
brew
ok
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
it
says
the
antithesis
of
unearthly
on
the
label
and
that
is
a
strange
statement
if
anything
i
felt
that
i
recognized
the
beer
clearly
from
southern
tiers
other
products
very
much
including
unearthly
it
is
different
but
its
more
like
a
little
brother
than
an
antithesis
it
goes
with
the
style
i
guess
and
variety
from
the
heavier
dipas
can
be
good
the
sweetness
surprised
me
and
dominated
the
bitterness
from
the
hops
a
nice
black
ale
from
southern
tier
taste
with
dark
sweetness
somewhat
strong
dark
fruitiness
in
the
middle
and
closes
a
bit
boozy
it
all
comes
together
well
though
mouthfeel
is
velvety
smooth
and
drinkability
is
good
also
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
a
double
ipa
im
thinking
no
however
i
dont
think
good
beers
always
have
to
fit
into
style
pigeonholes
dvery
drinkable
even
for
a
22
ounce
bottle
at
9abv
the
mocha
taste
lasts
more
than
the
others
and
it
tastes
very
well
doesnt
have
any
bad
tastes
that
keeps
this
from
being
extremely
enjoyable
still
one
of
the
best
black
ales
ive
ever
had
drinkability
is
fairly
high
despite
the
alcohol
content
one
of
the
original
black
ipas
which
are
becoming
popular
lately
i
appreciate
that
southern
tier
was
original
before
it
was
cool
to
make
this
style
pours
extremely
dark
brown
near
black
but
on
the
light
side
of
black
if
that
is
possible
with
a
tan
head
smell
is
full
of
chocolate
surprisingly
kind
of
expected
some
hoppy
bittnerness
but
it
actually
smells
closer
to
a
stout
than
anything
but
no
no
bitterness
in
the
nose
hmmm
tastes
more
like
a
hoppy
imperial
stout
than
anything
i
am
not
really
too
keen
on
the
taste
lingering
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
mostly
bitter
chocolate
second
black
ipa
for
me
capn
krunkles
although
i
didnt
care
for
it
either
was
closer
to
ipa
tastes
than
this
i
take
it
i
just
care
for
the
style
although
i
say
this
is
well
done
i
poured
the
iniquity
into
a
snifter
which
resulted
in
a
rather
minimal
head
just
enough
to
patch
over
the
top
and
create
a
bit
of
subtle
lacing
the
brew
true
to
the
bottle
label
is
nigh
pitch
black
though
does
show
hints
of
brown
and
amber
throughout
the
scent
is
of
sweet
syrup
and
citrus
a
bit
more
dessertlike
than
my
preconception
was
for
this
brew
the
hops
come
out
more
in
the
taste
however
starting
with
a
jolt
of
lemon
and
pine
followed
by
a
maltiness
oddly
reminiscent
of
sweet
japanese
milk
coffee
only
for
the
tang
of
hops
to
rise
once
more
again
in
the
lingering
aftertaste
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
appealing
though
i
would
have
appreciated
a
touch
more
carbonation
to
keep
the
brew
from
feeling
quite
so
weighty
upon
the
tongue
all
in
all
quite
a
tasty
find
and
i
do
hope
to
have
more
in
the
future
aromas
are
interesting
and
predictable
overriding
aroma
is
sweet
malts
with
dark
dried
fruits
like
prunes
and
raisins
some
roastiness
as
well
the
hop
aroma
is
muted
a
touch
of
vanilla
flavor
is
sweet
and
smooth
medium
bodied
with
notes
of
brown
sugar
molasses
candy
vanilla
finishes
with
smoky
red
man
chewing
tobacco
the
hops
are
more
spicy
than
bitter
in
this
brew
and
they
are
very
understated
until
the
very
end
a
rich
beer
the
complexity
on
the
finish
saves
it
from
being
too
rich
a
good
brew
southern
tier
is
really
starting
to
earn
my
respect
as
on
of
the
top
micros
in
the
us
i
hate
to
sound
like
the
typical
hophead
but
this
needs
more
hops
and
they
need
to
clearly
date
the
bottles
so
i
know
how
old
the
beer
im
drinking
is
also
i
put
the
bottle
down
too
closely
to
my
duvel
tulip
and
managed
to
crack
the
glass
not
southern
tiers
fault
but
im
rather
disappointed
honestly
though
i
dont
care
the
iniquity
is
delicious
and
really
cool
it
has
a
nice
dry
and
slightly
quenching
finish
with
some
roast
and
smoke
coming
though
it
was
exceptionally
appetizing
i
actually
enjoyed
it
with
a
roast
beef
dinner
with
bacon
potato
pie
absolute
heaven
i
really
think
that
this
is
the
most
drinkable
highalcohol
beer
ive
had
in
a
while
the
alcohol
isnt
even
detectable
delicious
di
like
it
but
i
will
only
be
having
1or
2
a
night
this
is
not
an
everyday
beer
rather
impressive
tasty
with
a
nice
aroma
wellhidden
abv
overall
a
solid
representation
of
the
cda
style
as
opposed
to
a
hoppy
porter
though
at
times
it
wants
to
lean
toward
the
latter
highly
drinkable
but
for
the
other
offerings
on
tap
that
night
i
absolutely
would
have
had
another
iniquity
has
an
imposing
look
and
a
musty
flavor
but
its
sweet
and
smooth
finish
make
sure
its
bark
is
worse
than
its
bite
you
cant
ignore
the
alcohol
but
its
decently
masked
for
being
a
9er
id
gladly
drink
this
again
but
most
likely
single
doses
if
i
plan
on
drinking
anything
else
with
noticeable
hops
in
it
all
in
all
this
reminds
me
of
a
more
sweeter
maltier
ssra
and
its
definitely
good
i
enjoyed
this
one
another
good
one
from
southern
tier
pours
a
very
dark
reddishbrown
with
thick
offwhite
head
and
lots
of
lacing
with
good
retention
smells
of
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
some
roasted
malt
one
of
the
better
smelling
cascadian
dark
ales
i
like
this
name
the
best
as
it
seems
to
be
really
well
balanced
between
the
hops
and
the
roasted
malt
however
the
flavour
im
not
as
impressed
with
it
just
seems
a
bit
too
much
like
a
sweet
syrup
then
the
bitter
roasted
flavour
the
smell
would
suggest
if
you
have
a
sweet
tooth
i
can
see
finding
that
appealing
though
mouthfeel
is
quite
creamy
dark
reddish
brown
pour
very
little
head
with
no
lacing
left
behind
on
the
glass
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
sweet
malts
and
bittering
hops
syrupy
mouthfeel
but
could
definitely
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
imo
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
not
likely
to
seek
it
out
again
lighter
mouthfeel
than
i
expected
but
still
good
i
liked
the
beer
thought
it
tasted
good
and
finished
cleanly
overall
id
have
this
again
with
pleasure
d
the
sweetness
is
a
little
much
its
decent
for
the
style
the
big
selling
point
is
the
blackness
i
guess
but
whatever
its
an
average
dipa
this
beer
is
an
absolute
steal
if
you
can
find
it
like
i
did
for
less
than
6
per
bottle
seek
it
out
dont
ignore
it
on
that
gorgeous
shelf
of
southern
tier
imperials
d
refreshing
and
still
complex
with
some
good
flavors
and
good
strength
not
hard
to
drink
at
all
very
good
now
but
could
age
well
too
pours
black
with
only
the
faintest
bit
of
bubbles
around
the
glass
scent
is
a
mild
and
subdued
combinaton
of
dark
roasted
grain
faintest
hints
of
roasted
coffee
and
cocoa
beans
a
slight
herbal
earthy
and
piney
hop
quality
is
there
taste
again
brings
a
relatively
mild
and
subdued
quality
the
roasted
grains
are
present
backed
by
a
noticibly
unbitter
presence
of
earhty
floral
and
piney
hops
tastes
of
dark
fruit
coffee
and
chocolate
barely
touch
the
palate
medium
bodied
mildly
carbonated
a
decent
beer
that
has
some
very
mild
flavors
and
lacks
a
bitter
bite
nout
much
of
a
dipa
in
my
opinion
solid
black
ipa
but
weak
aroma
and
thin
body
dont
help
love
a
beer
that
evolves
in
the
glass
pours
a
dark
red
cola
colour
with
not
much
head
initial
bouquet
of
citrus
hops
gives
way
to
some
interesting
cocoa
and
yeast
aromas
on
the
palate
as
well
what
starts
out
tasting
like
an
ipa
with
driving
bitterness
starts
to
morph
into
a
smooth
almost
dark
belgian
kind
of
vibe
finishes
dry
but
with
a
hint
of
yeast
sweetness
ive
only
had
a
couple
of
beers
in
this
style
but
this
is
the
one
that
has
really
sold
it
for
me
o
pretty
decent
flavor
is
fairly
mellow
but
makes
it
very
drinkable
drinkability
is
high
lots
of
stuff
going
on
that
is
reminiscent
of
an
american
barleywine
lite
nice
id
buy
a
bomber
of
this
for
sure
and
would
get
it
again
on
tap
creme
brulee
was
still
way
too
much
of
a
good
thing
big
friggin
dark
ale
i
like
it
d
im
drinking
this
easy
and
i
could
have
some
more
big
bodied
with
a
nice
smooth
feel
a
good
sipper
even
on
a
hot
spring
day
overall
an
okay
beer
after
having
the
unearthly
ipa
i
had
high
expectations
which
were
let
down
it
is
still
a
good
beer
but
after
having
sublimely
selfrighteous
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
it
is
apparent
this
one
is
in
a
different
league
consumed
jan
2010
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
tasty
dark
ipa
totally
different
then
the
local
cdas
but
very
good
granted
my
bias
towards
them
its
still
very
good
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
southern
tier
i
would
take
this
brew
over
any
of
their
imperial
ipas
unearthly
oaked
unearthly
hoppe
and
gemeni
its
just
better
still
on
the
sweet
side
but
at
least
it
seems
most
of
the
sweetness
is
from
the
grain
d
as
for
most
high
abv
southern
tier
beers
i
could
enjoy
in
succession
this
one
was
kind
of
one
and
done
due
to
the
alcohol
being
very
noticeable
i
would
much
rather
pick
up
another
unearthy
or
javha
than
drop
another
9
on
a
bomber
one
and
done
this
is
a
beer
that
should
be
tried
though
at
least
once
really
like
the
texture
big
body
plush
feel
no
real
noticeable
alcohol
easy
drinker
for
a
style
i
dont
consider
to
be
terribly
drinkable
its
no
sublimely
selfrighteous
but
its
still
a
delicious
beer
another
southern
tier
big
beer
is
a
winner
southern
tier
is
newly
arrived
in
maine
thus
far
not
impressed
i
imagine
ill
try
some
of
their
other
beers
this
beer
is
a
failed
experiment
tastes
like
biscuits
slathered
in
blackberry
and
currant
jam
quite
fruity
and
yeasty
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
hop
flavor
but
not
really
a
whole
bunch
of
bitterness
malts
are
pretty
sweet
with
some
semisweet
chocolate
and
caramel
toffee
coming
through
too
much
alcohol
is
piled
on
top
to
make
for
a
pretty
messy
offering
its
ok
but
after
having
stones
ssra
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
as
a
black
ipa
drinkability
like
i
said
doesnt
taste
or
feel
like
9
alcohol
so
i
gave
it
high
marks
for
drinkability
but
id
hesitate
on
going
back
for
another
bottle
auspices
of
the
reliably
good
taste
of
one
gambrinus
this
black
beauty
shows
a
dark
black
brown
color
with
a
fair
light
tan
colored
head
and
solid
lacing
the
aroma
is
heavy
imperial
malt
also
some
tasty
roasted
ham
and
red
wine
awesome
the
flavor
brings
peaty
herbal
malt
and
deep
caramel
its
a
little
bit
smokey
with
a
hint
of
ham
and
a
maple
sweetness
full
bodied
and
reasonably
carbonated
but
fairly
drinkable
for
the
style
which
is
quite
unique
luscious
feel
and
delicious
a
hit
for
any
lover
of
heavy
malt
with
a
hop
touch
a
very
good
blend
of
styles
notes
this
would
be
my
first
black
ipa
this
is
definitely
a
baltic
porter
at
heart
if
i
had
this
during
a
blind
tasting
2010

probably
classify
this
beer
as
a
strong
ale
id
recommend
anything
from
the
imperial
selection
of
southern
tier
looking
forward
to
their
2xipa
coming
soon

its
not

try
again

extremely

d
i
quite
like
it
but
i
wish
it
didnt
have
a
dry
feel
d
pretty
drinkable
especially
for
such
a
twist
on
a
traditional
style
really
like
their
creativity

speak

finish
had
a
salty
medium
finish
that
lingered
another
beer
to
share
d
good
drinker
i
will
be
buying
this
again
since
its
now
in
indiana
good
beer
to
try
when
you
want
something
new
drinkability
tastes
more
like
a
schwarzbier
than
a
dipa
that
being
said
i
should
probably
rate
this
beer
lower
than
i
will
because
im
not
sure
it
lines
itself
up
with
dipas
however
it
is
still
a
tasty
brew
i
would
have
again
but
wouldnt
seek
out
overall
next
another
nice
snag
from
my
quick
visit
to
the
piggly
wiggly
at
market
commons
in
myrtle
beach
sc
this
one
pours
a
deep
cola
brown
if
held
to
the
light
other
wise
it
looks
like
a
huge
dark
black
schwarzbier
head
is
light
beige
tan
and
rises
well
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
looks
like
bready
rising
lacing
is
streaked
evenly
with
each
sip
and
makes
the
beer
look
very
appetizing
aromatics
have
deep
herbal
and
pine
like
hop
cone
action
going
on
amongst
deep
dark
roasty
malts
and
a
touch
of
mellow
alcohol
in
the
background
im
getting
some
herbal
mint
like
qualities
amongst
the
dark
bitter
chocolate
roasts
flavor
is
fantastic
one
of
the
dark
semi
sweet
chocolates
with
a
dry
finish
enough
malts
give
it
a
caramel
roasted
malt
flavor
but
overall
very
hoppy
expressive
flavor
that
includes
more
herbal
and
aggressive
pine
hop
action
to
the
enjoyable
imperial
black
ale
i
have
in
front
of
me
mouthfeel
is
fuller
bodied
with
a
touch
of
cloying
milk
chocolate
syrup
notes
carbonation
level
is
carried
well
here
nothing
that
makes
me
want
to
pour
it
out
very
enjoyable
in
fact
much
more
so
than
other
hopped
up
dark
ales
with
the
higher
alcohol
contents
i
split
this
with
my
wife
who
typically
enjoys
darker
offerings
i
ended
up
finishing
more
of
this
than
she
could
handle
i
think
the
hop
forward
approach
in
this
dark
caught
her
off
guard
found
iniquity
on
the
shelf
and
decided
to
give
it
a
try
after
all
southern
tier
rarely
makes
an
undrinkable
beer
poured
dark

minimal

the
sweet
roasted
malts
come
through
to
balance
the
flavour
taste
and
smell
go
hand
in
hand
can
detect
the
hops
however
the
maltiness
is
quick
to
balance
very
smooth
finish
and
quite
enjoyable
i
would
buy
more
of
these
when
i
see
them
i
didnt
really
know
what
to
expect
coming
in
to
this
tasting
but
i
left
very
surprised
and
pleased
also
this
was
on
sale
and
i
was
lucky
to
pick
up
a
few
bombers
ps
overlord
good
call
with
the
arrogant
bastard
similarities
after
reading
your
review
i
can
taste
that
connection
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
get
this
whenever
i
wanted
but
for
now
ill
have
to
stick
to
trading
d
this
is
a
unique
and
outstanding
beer
great
balance
and
flavor
and
great
texture
southern
tier
just
puts
out
one
great
beer
after
another
they
are
easily
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
iniquity
is
a
well
crafted
brew
to
say
the
least
pour
looks
thin
but
its
completely
opaque
with
fluffy
tan
head
standing
about
1
5
inches
high
nose
is
somewhat
muted
but
theres
that
telltale
cascade
aroma
sitting
on

of
some

malt
aromas
palate
is
crisp
and
flavors
are
complex
and
mingling
crisp
hoppiness
up

is

tallywhacked
black
chocolate
malt
which
is
supported
by
a
net
of
alphaacid
and
lemon
zest
medium
to
lightbodied
esp
for
the
style
and
crisp
like
any
great
black
lager
i
know
its
an
ale
does
well
as
my
first
imperial
black
ale
nicely
done
would
like

off

more

that

very
interesting
and
unique
beer
that
really
worked
for
me
well
nice
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
a
good
brew
overall
excellent
sipper
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
basically
astounds
me
every
sip
not
because
the
flavors
change
but
because
its
so
well
balanced
and
intriguing
i
could
sip
this
and
stare
into
a
fire
for
hours
highly
recommend
d
this
one
goes
down
so
much
more
smoothly
than
i
expected
it
disappeared
quickly
the
sweet
sort
of
blackness
blended
with
genuine
ipa
hop
maks
for
a
drinkable
beverage
its
a
really
light
sweetnessi
dont
know
the
calorie
content
but
minus
the
alcohol
it
seems
like
a
dieters
dream
uh
as
far
as
sweet
beers
go
a
really
strong
offering
from
southern
tiernot
just
the
antithesis
of
unearthly
as
the
bottle
suggests
but
better
picked
up
this
bottle
in
buffalo
pours
a
pure
black
with
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
decent
retention
and
lace
the
aroma
is
good
a
mix
of
chocolate
and
coffee
with
some
lovely
chops
the
flavour
is
not
quite
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
and
shows
more
balance
than
usually
found
in
southern
tiers
big
beers
while
also
dropping
the
booziness
that
they
tend
to
have
chocolate
and
lightly
roast
coffee
mix
in
with
some
smoke
before
hitting
a
good
splash
of
grapefruit
and
some
pine
in
the
finish
simple
but
good
medium
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
for
an
imperial
nice
stuff
from
st
pours
a
cola
like
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
tan
head
that
gives
way
to
good
lacing
the
smell
is
of
coffee
and
chocolate
as
well
as
citrus
and
piney
hops
the
taste
is
of
malt
chocolate
and
sweet
malts
at
the
front
end
the
taste
is
balanced
out
by
citrus
and
piney
hops
for
a
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
but
overall
it
is
very
good
the
overall
drinkability
is
very
high
it
is
an
overall
very
complex
beer
with
a
lot
of
malt
and
hop
balance
the
9
is
a
bit
dangerous
the
combination
of
sweetness
with
the
light
body
and
hops
make
it
very
drinkable
and
very
easy
to
forget
that
youre
drinking
9
d
this
beer
is
a
nice
ipa
with
a
twist
of
some
soft
mellow
dark
malt
notes
interesting
concept
that
was
nice
to
drink
imperial
black
ale
thats
what
southern
tier
calls
it
and
the
name
is
rather
fitting
in
character
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
combination
of
new
belgiums
enlightened
black
ale
and
a
nice
hefty
dipa
but
with
pronounced
imperial
stout
leanings
as
well
very
interesting
and
very
very
tasty
definitely
a
musttry
mfd
medium
bodied
and
slightly
sticky
very
enjoyable
a
little
boozy
not
overwhelming
but
there
for
sure
chewy
and
nice
light
carbonation
pours
a
slightly
dark
brown
somewhere
between
a
traditional
ipa
and
a
stout
head
like
a
stout
same
mocha
color
and
billoweyness
smells
like
sweet
hops
basically
except
unlike
a
busy
malty
ipa
like
dfh
90
they
really
blend
together
quite
well
mostly
earthy
a
bit
of
pine
not
much
citrus
taste
is
great
the
flavors
compliment
each
other
its
like
drinking
a
real
earthy
ipa
except
without
the
huge
pine
sensations
the
malt
sweetness
drives
it
almost
like
a
real
hoppy
brown
or
some
such
if
youre
looking
for
a
real
strong
dipa
this
isnt
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
great
balance
between
malt
and
hop
this
is
the
target
nice
coating
mouthfeel
and
sublimely
drinkable
for
me
who
isnt
a
huge
fan
of
ipas
especially
huge
malty
confused
ones
this
walks
the
line
perfectly
bravo
just
had
to
check
the
abv
9
wow
be
careful
with
this
one
it
drinks
real
easily
heres
what
i
love
about
southern
tier
i
havent
had
too
many
of
their
stuff
yet
but
everything
ive
had
is
robust
and
flavorful
good
stuff
all
around
if
this
were
a
normalcolored
imperial
india
pale
ale
i
might
not
score
it
as
highly
as
i
am
the
fact
is
though
that
this
beer
tastes
like
a
double
ipa
and
looks
like
a
porter
the
sensory
headtrip
is
really
fun
and
makes
this
a
great
beer
to
spring
on
a
party
the
sense
of
play
that
the
brewmasters
at
southern
tier
imbued
this
beer
needs
to
be
acknowledged
and
taken
into
account
fun
tasty
hoppy
this
is
a
recommended
beer
oh
another
thing
about
the
label
they
call
it
an
imperial
iba
firstly
i
thought
the
ttb
did
away
with
any
abbreviations
on
labels
but
regardless
im
guessing
theyre
calling
it
an
imperial
brown
ale
or
is
that
imperial
black
ale
imperial
blacl
ale
fits
better
but
whatever
you
call
it
im
drinking
it
the
darkened
malt
and
citruspine
hops
just
go
together
so
well
and
despite
its
strength
its
oh
so
drinkable
additionally
althought
its
not
really
complex
a
couple
of
malt
notes
here
some
yeasty
fruit
there
a
few
shining
hop
flavors
and
some
bitterness
its
actually
very
unique
ive
never
had
a
beer
like
it
before
and
that
makes
it
interesting
enough
for
me
well
done
and
given
that
uniqueness
well
worth
trying
kudos
once
again
to
southern
tier
iniquity
smells
like
roasted
malt
dark
chocolate
a
dose
of
hops
in
there
as
well
sipping
this
offering
from
southern
tier
it
tastes
rich
sweet
some
of
that
strong
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
taste
as
well
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
strong
but
interesting
in
this
imperial
black
ale
good
idea
to
have
some
water
after
this
beer
drinkability
is
average
on
this
heavy
beer
it
makes
for
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
a
dessert
such
as
a
brownie
sundae
d
tasty
and
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
and
i
would
like
to
see
if
some
time
on
it
would
mellow
the
alcohol
would
also
like
to
try
it
alongside
some
other
foods
like
something
spicy

black
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
nice
blend

the
taste
is

malts
cocoa
citrus
hops
and
traces

the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
alcohol
presence
im
always
eager
to
try
hoppy
dark
beers
but
this
one
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
i
could
drink
this
all
night
well
ummmm
i
could
drink
this
for
a
couple
of
hours
only
to
wake
up
the
next
day
in
a
puddle
of
chocolate
colored
drool
my
thumb
in
a
glass
of
lukewarm
water
and
my
jeans
soaked
to
a
deep
navy
with
a
headache
and
a
smile
fun
and
brutal
i
couldnt
see
drinking
a
lot
of
this
or
even
very
often
but
this
has
a
great
deal
of
deviant
charm
theyre
not
kidding
when
they
call
this
a
black
aleits
very
darkno
light
will
shine
thru
this
has
a
giant
tan
foamy
head
that
lasts
forever
and
leaves
great

the
taste
is
nice
with

buttery
roasted

this
is
a
very
unique
brew
the
mf
is
light
for
a
high
octane
beer
and
all
the
flavors
mix
well
a
very
memorable
beer
that
you
really
must
try
interesting
take
on
the
new
black
ipa
style
with
slightly
more
roast
and
coffee
character
than
you
would
expect
from
a
regular
ipa
perhaps
tough
to
drink
more
than
a
pint
or
two
though
drinkability
pretty
tasty
for
a
9er
the
closest
thing
ive
had
to
the
local
double
dark
ipa
by
barrelhouse
rock
on
st
blipped
a
crazy

of

sun
by

very
interesting
blend
of
ipa
characteristics
and
porterschwarz
one
of
the
more
unique
brews
out
there
and
a
good
one
on
top
of
that
just
dont
come
in
with
any
expectations
md
medium
to
full
bodied
with
very
active
carbonation
the
bitterness
coats
the
mouth
and
lingers
definitely
one
i
could
sit
down
with
for
a
long
time
d
delicious
another
great
beer
from
southern
tier
great
mix
of
dark
and
hoppy
drinkability
i
dont
think
my
palate
would
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
an
evening
this
is
a
really
fun
beer
to
drink
though
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
another
buy
from
southern
tier
that
will
end
up
in
my
crate
in
the
future
you
would
never
know
from
looking
at
the
bottle
that
this
was
a
double
ipa
once
you
pour
it
its
completely
black
but
not
so
thick
more
like
a
black
beer
than
a
stout
or
a
porter
the
taste
smell
flavor
mouthfeel
are
all
imperial
ipa
if
i
had
my
eyes
closed
im
not
even
sure
id
know
it
was
black
maybe
the
slightest
hint
of
roasted
barley
another
big
score
for
southern
tier
d
i
dont
think
ill
go
back
to
this
one
pretty
much
disappointed
here
overall
a
very
fine
beer
that
will
sneak
up
on
ya
southern
tier
are
fast
becoming
one
of
the
greatest
u
s
brewers
of
all
time
and
im
not
surprised
theyve
come
up
with
another
utterly
fantastic
beer
with
iniquity
this
is
a
winner
and
one
i
would
love
to
have
on
hand
regularly
this
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
slight
with
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
and
caramel
the
taste
is
mildly
sweet
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
there
is
a
buttery
feel
of
alcohol
on
the
lips
and
the
taste
is
pretty
balanced
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
turns
to
an
alcohol
warmth
and
taste
this
is
just
a
great
beer
unlike
anything
i
have
had
recently
certainly
something
i
will
visit
again
a
must
try
way
too
easy
to
drink
i
am
putting
this
thing
down
quick
this
does
not
resemble
many
guidelines
within
its
style
but
its
absolutely
delicious
not
a
session
beer
bottle
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
citrus
cappucino
coffee
and
light
roasted
malt
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
a
roasted
maltcoffee
finish
more
on
the
brown
ale
side
than
the
ipa
side
i
think
but
an
interesting
blend
a
little
sweet
too
but
i
liked
it
overall
so
unique
so
unusual
so
really
delicious
the
best
of
malt
the
best
of
hops
damn
what
is
up
with
these
guys
just
keep
making
the
great
beer
southern
tier
here
is
a
cross
between
a
brown
ale
and
a
double
ipa
delicious
and
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
ok
poured
into
my
iron
city
beer
pint
glass
the
head
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
this
beer
looking
like
a
glass
of
coke
i
suggest
smellingtasting
this
beer
with
your
eyes
closed
the
color
plays
tricks
with
your
mind
as
youre
expecting
a
roasty
porter
smell
instead
youre
met
with
an
ipaish
aroma
but
it
seems
muted
inhale
deeply
and
the
hops
start
to
fill
up
your
nose
but
stop
short
the
alcohol
is
definitely
present
in
the
taste
but
its
not
overpowering
overall
an
interesting
twist
on
an
imperial
ipa
mouth
is
medium
varbonation
and
slightly
viscous
drinks
well
and
quite
slow
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
would
almost
call
it
more
of
a
porter
than
a
ipadipa
doesnt
seem
as
extreme
as
the
other
southern
tier
bombers
but
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
pours
black
with
a
very
thin
tan
head
nose
is
like
older
tea
no
its
iced
tea
i
hate
iced
tea
try
growing
up
in
the
very
deep
south
hating
iced
tea
going
to
someones
house
for
dinner
and
they
dont
put
a
glass
of
water
out
next
to
your
plate
just
a
glass
of
iced
tea
flavor
is
bringing
the
tea
yet
again
tea
beer
really
that
is
what
i
am
getting
here
feel
has
a
nice
enough
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
fairly
thicker
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
will
say
it
again
this
is
a
tea
beer
doubleimpy
ipa
huh
i
get
almost
no
hop
character
whatsoever
off
this
overall
a
try
it
beer
cheers
d
a
singular
brew
with
a
rare
but
excellent
combination
of
dark
malt
with
ctype
hops
created
with
great
feel
a
wonderful
beer
to
come
back
to
periodically
and
not
a
bad
value
for
the
contents
to
boot
drinkability
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
black
ipa
and
what
a
good
experience
it
was
it
was
a
very
interesting
beer
not
only
was
the
beer
roasted
but
yet
it
had
a
touch
of
citrus
flavors
to
it
if
you
want
to
try
something
out
of
the
ordinary
then
i
would
try
this
beer
would
i
ever
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
once
more
but
that
would
be
it
22oz
just
realized
that
this
is
classified
as
an
imperial
ipa
interesting
i
was
expecting
american
strong
ale
poured
near
black
with
hues
of
chestnut
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
when
held
to
the
light
beige
head
is
thin
but
still
respectable
and
it
leaves
a
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
of
floral
hops
citrusy
grapefruit
and
pine
a
blind
sniff
would
reveal
an
ipa
or
imperial
ipa
smells
pretty
good
initial
tastes
are
completely
different
than
aroma
weve
got
roasted
malts
with
slight
hints
of
molasses
and
chocolate
these
notes
dont
last
long
and
are
quickly
taken
over
by
a
nice
hop
character
citrus
with
some
pine
notes
which
really
brings
this
all
together
to
be
an
incredibly
balanced
ale
overall
i
really
liked
this
one
and
wouldnt
change
anything
about
it
definitely
recommendable
overall
another
nice
selection
from
southern
tier
ive
been
very
pleased
with
their
imperial
beer
selection
and
this
is
no
exception
bitter
and
sharp
on
the
finish
rounding
out
with
a
little
roasted
malt
in
the
back
palate
lingering
hops
ontap
at
the
acadia
cafe
in
minneapolis
i
had
a
small
glass
during
the
bars
ipa
tasting
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
change
of
change
for
big
hoppy
beers
i
thought
the
malt
profile
landed
it
more
in
the
neighborhood
of
an
imperial
brown
ale
theres
some
dark
roast
in
the
flavor
but
also
toffee
and
caramel
and
like
a
lot
of
imperial
malty
beers
that
try
to
be
dipas
in
some
sort
the
hops
dont
quite
dominate
like
they
do
in
a
regular
ipa
still
very
tasty
and
enjoyable
worth
a
try
though
id
just
call
it
an
american
strong
ale
d
i
was
glad
to
see
that
this
wasnt
yet
another
11
st
beer
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
and
we
really
enjoyed
the
hoppysweetroasted
maltyness
of
this
beer
not
sure
ill
seek
this
one
out
again
very
clean
and
refreshing
and
another
really
well
done
beer
by
southern
tier
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
awesome
i
like
it
alot
better
than
southern
tiers
unearthly
and
hoppe
i
also
think
this
beer
is
more
complex
than
stones
ssra
i
just
wish
the
flavors
would
coat
your
mouth
a
little
more
worth
the
time
and
money
for
sure
for
drinkability
this
is
an
awesome
freaking
beer
i
will
buy
it
again
i
will
search
this
beer
out
on
tap
this
beer
is
all
substance
but
no
points
for
style
call
this
beer
an
imperial
india
porter
ale
and
youd
be
dead
on
pours
a
typical
black
ale
appearance
very
dark
brown
lighter
on
the
edges
smallish
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
the
aroma
is
of
a
light
citrus
hop
some
pine
and
a
bready
honey
malt
kind
of
a
funky
hop
aroma
not
much
in
roasted
malt
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
honey
like
a
traditional
dipa
some
tin
like
hops
with
perhaps
a
touch
of
pine
there
is
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
in
the
end
to
me
has
very
much
the
dipa
flavors
malty
sweet
though
not
very
hoppy
no
real
roasted
malt
characteristics
like
a
traditional
black
ale
seems
the
color
is
the
only
true
characteristic
of
a
black
ale
a
nice
moderate
feel
with
prickly
carbonation
finishes
sweet
but
not
cloying
nice
balancing
bitter
hop
just
ok
for
me
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flavors
too
much
of
a
honey
malt
dipa
quality
i
was
looking
for
a
nice
roasted
malt
but
only
got
a
bit
it
does
drink
fairly
easy
as
there
are
no
dominate
flavors
and
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
this
is
a
very
mellow
brew
and
when
it
was
fresh
it
was
likely
more
vibrant
with
the
hops
and
warmer
however
i
really
like
it
and
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
as
this
type
of
ipa
is
uncommon
worth
a
shot
if
you
enjoy
sts
other
iipas
unearthly
hoppe
and
gemini
its
all
a
mishmash
of
oddlymatched
flavors
but
it
doesnt
bring
the
brew
down
though
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
bigger
its
just
unique
i
was
scared
to
get
this
one
when
i
saw
it
poured
on
draught
because
of
its
thick
black
pour
i
couldnt
resist
a
beautiful
and
smooth
black
ale
with
all
the
sweet
aromas
and
flavours
i
cannot
resist
getting
bottles
as
well
as
draught
i
will
miss
it
when
my
work
runs
out
of
it
d
good
drinkability
nicely
hopped
with
accents
of
soft
roasted
malting
gives
this
a
nice
spin
on
an
ipa
smooth
going
down
and
defiantly
good
for
a
few
i
like
what
southern
tier
did
here
there
are
so
many
ipas
out
there
that
remind
you
of
this
one
or
that
one
this
ipa
takes
a
chance
at
something
different
and
that
is
ok
in
my
book
it
is
ok
to
switch
things
up
once
in
a
while
nice
job
i
bought
this
bottle
at
blacklick
liquor
on
broad
street
a
few
weeks
ago
d
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
you
definitely
cant
kill
more
than
one
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
goes
down
fairly
easily
while
being
slightly
dry
overall
this
was
a
tasty
black
ipa
however
i
found
it
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
malt
wise
very
enjoyable
beer
finishes
a
little
citrusy
acidic
in
the
mouth
but
that
is
about
the
only
complaint
very
well
done
very
dark
brown
but
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
was
clear
and
had
a
deep
reddish
chestnut
colour
a
fine
cap
appeared
after
the
pour
settling
to
a
collar
with
a
skim
of
bubbles
topping
the
beer
good
retention
after
that
with
a
lot
of
spotty
lace
big
citrus
aroma
tangerine
and
grapefruit
more
rind
and
pith
than
flesh
plus
a
little
pineapple
malt
was
present
but
far
in
the
background
with
some
caramel
and
molasses
sturdy
bitterness
but
really
just
enough
to
overcome
the
malt
presence
malty
caramel
and
brown
sugar
sweetness
were
complemented
by
dried
fruits
prunes
raisins
and
a
bit
of
roast
toasty
and
a
bit
doughy
with
a
pleasant
fruitiness
hops
were
in
the
grapefruit
to
pine
range
but
were
balanced
nicely
with
the
malts
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
a
little
less
than
average
smooth
not
much
of
an
alcohol
presence
perhaps
a
bit
of
alcohol
spice
in
the
finish
and
a
hint
of
warmth
quite
good
really
drinkable
for
a
bigger
beer
the
balance
really
worked
for
me
overall
very
different
and
ill
have
to
try
it
again
sometime
complex
enjoyable
a
balance
between
hops
and
malt
go
get
this
drinks
fine
for
a
noticeably
stong
brew
interesting
and
enjoyable
for
that
expect
a
rereview
of
this
one
pours
out
a
dark
brown
color
light
mahogany
higlights
with
a
massive
tan
head
the
head
is
formed
with
loose
bubbles
which
leave
just
little
bits
of
lacing
and
kind
of
stays
around
for
most
of
the
drink
the
smell
is
very
nice
fruity
piney
resinous
hops
are
sitting
on
top
theres
a
tiny
bit
of
lemony
citrus
peel
underneath
with
a
big
chocolatey
back
theres
also
a
fruity
raisiny
note
underneath
i
love
the
smell
of
dark
hoppy
beers
so
much
complexity
the
taste
is
really
great
too
theres
a
good
hoppiness
but
actually
a
very
well
hidden
bitterness
with
lots
of
flavor
i
get
so
much
orangey
lemony
hop
flavor
with
a
bit
of
tropical
fruitiness
and
some
resinous
flavors
then
the
maltiness
really
kicks
in
coffee
dark
chocolate
a
good
bit
of
sweetness
like
raisins
of
plums
no
dryness
just
very
full
flavor
i
like
it
it
feels
just
a
bit
watery
at
least
more
watery
than
i
wouldve
expected
very
little
alcohol
presence
a
good
thing
a
bit
syrupy
kind
of
prickly
carbonation
a
pleasant
drink
easy
to
go
down
and
it
wont
hit
you
too
fast
but
i
can
already
feel
it
about
half
way
through
i
would
recommend
it
for
the
pure
enjoyment

the
dark

makes
me
think
more
of
something
like
a
darker
hoppier
belgian
strong
dark
ale
maybe
belgian
black
ipa
no
it
doesnt
have
that
belgian
yeast
character
and
the
hops
are
still
distinctly
american
ah
who
cares
what
we
call
it
its
a
damn
tasty

that
ill
definitely
be
picking
up

stuff
thanks
russ
d
abv
is
very
well
hidden
a
very
drinkable
brew
but
not
a
session
brew
due
to
the
extreme
hop
nature
and
the
abv
eventually
catches
up
to
you
surprise
your
friends
with
this
one
the
dark
color
will
not
prepare
them
for
the
taste
again
if
you
are
a
hop
lover
seek
this
out
it
is
certainly
an
interesting
experiment
sniffing
my
glass
after
pouring
this
dark
brew
i
was
surprised
to
detect
a
floral
scent
underneath
which
was
a
barely
noticeable
hint
of
alcohol
an
impressive
off
white
head
frothed
to
the
top
of
my
glass
taking
a
first
sip
a
floral
hop
flavor
immediately
hit
followed
by
a
very
mellow
bitter
chocolate
flavor
as
with
the
aroma
a
scantily
noticeable
trace
of
alcohol
was
detected
but
it
did
not
detract
from
this
delicious
concoction
drinkability
much
more
like
a
dark
unearthly
than
the
bottled
version
this
one
actually
tasted
dark
does
that
mean
its
better
or
worse
im
not
sure
but
i
do
know
that
this
one
was
more
what
i
expected
than
the
other
at
9
its
not
as
big
as
the
unearthly
either
enhancing
the
drinkability
ever
so
slightly
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
can
only
drink
in
small
quantities
it
turns
out
being
very
sweet
that
seems
to
take
over
the
whole
beer
still
very
different
and
a
very
solid
beer
m
thin
bodied
creamy
good
carbonation
purchased
on
the
advice
of
kendo
and
glad
i
did
poured
into
an
old
griffen
pint
glass
it
looked
a
lot
like
soda
not
quite
black
with
a
decent
head
i
got
the
smelll
of
malt
coffee
and
i
thougt
licorice
as
well
and
that
was
reflected
in
the
taste
it
may
be
mistaken
for
a
stout
by
appearance
and
smell
though
not
in
mouthfeel
much
thinner
a
great
brew
by
the
great
folks
at
st
again
pours
black
body
with
a
white
generous
head
great
caroma
great
taste
of
grapefruit
lemon
with
the
malting
making
it
a
great
complexity
aboveaverage
moutheel
good
drinkability
a
tad
acidic
still
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
regardless
of
being
a
dipa
the
beer
poured
a
rich
black
with
a
nice
tan
head
the
aroma
is
of
toasted
malt
coffee
and
hops
it
tastes
of
sweet
toasted
malt
front
end
with
a
hoppy
coffee
finish
the
feel
is
medium
and
dry
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
nice
and
rich
the
malt
up
front
was
so
enjoyable
it
allowed
me
to
appreciate
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
d
a
nice
beer
but
in
the
end
nothing
too
special
here
a
bigger
dose
of
malt
would
result
in
a
more
layered
presentation
and
could
tone
down
some
of
the
pine
wow
a
definite
surprise
for
me
im
used
to
their
excessively
malty
beer
but
in
this
one
it
works
you
may
not
have
heard
about
it
when
it
came
out
but
iniquity
is
a
beer
worth
drinking
d
a
very
good
black
ipa
if
you
will
but
one
of
the
best
of
the
hoppy
black
ales
nice
hop
flavors
which
tak
priority
over
the
bitterness
and
the
black
malt
is
not
bitter
the
malt
adds
roastiness
but
still
allows
the
hops
to
shine
throuh
highly
recommend
this
ale
another
great
example
of
the
style
d
i
guess
there
really
wasnt
another
style
to
categorize
this
beer
in
other
than
imperial
ipa
its
not
necessarily
apt
but
this
is
definitely
an
excellent
drinkable
beer
dwow
this
is
damn
good
stuff
another
southern
tier
imperial
brew
that
rocks
full
of
flavour
truly
a
nice
surprise
a
22
ounce
bomber
bottle
split
with
psycohops
and
deuane
poured
into
a
shaker
glass
appears
a
deep
and
dark
but
still
translucent
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
fresh
candied
orange
and
lemon
peels
dusted
with
cocoa
powder
full
of
fruity
citrus
hop
notes
with
an
ample
amount
of
roasted
grain
and
caramelized
malts
rather
smooth
drinking
with
little
to
no
alcohol
presence
and
medium
carbonation
delicious
and
dangerously
drinkable
thanks
for
the
bottle
alan
banditbrewingco
this
poured
a
translucent
mahogany
with
light
tan
head
it
smelled
like
copper
and
grapefruit
hops
and
sweet
honey
with
some
roasted
coffee
it
tasted
like
grapefruit
and
pineapple
and
orange
along
with
roasted
coffee
and
sweet
honey
it
was
fairly
thick
with
smooth
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
aftertaste
overall
this
was
an
excellent
black
ipa
maybe
better
than
stones
it
had
great
delicate
flavor
that
was
well
balanced
and
very
clean
it
had
great
body
too
and
was
quite
easy
to
drink
i
just
love
this
beer
had
this
several
times
since
and
have
to
say
on
each
revisit
have
found
the
malts
a
bit
heavy
handed
and
artificially
sweet
still
worth
trying
another
successful
experiment
from
st
i
think
it
could
be
slightly
less
sweet
but
it
delivers
everywhere
else
reminds
me
of
a
black
and
tan
i
had
with
a
sweet
east
coast
ipa
and
a
nice
balanced
stout
if
you
were
to
stir
it
up
pours
very
dark
with
minimal
light
coming
through
not
much
of
a
head
but
tremendous
lacing
smells
very
floral
citrusy
tropical
fruits
hop
bomb
tastes
of
more
huge
hoppiness
citrusy
pine
melon
hints
of
alcohol
light
roastiness
delicious
mouthfeel
is
pretty
heavy
perfect
carbonation
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
fantastic
tasting
hop
burps
on
tap
at
rustico
pours
brown
with
half
a
fingers
worth
of
tan
head
strong
delicious
floral
hop
taste
giving
way
to
chocalteysweet
goodness
combining
to
amazing
aftertaste
and
the
best
hop
burps
ever
very
drinkable
at
9
no
noticeable
burn
ive
had
a
few
of
these
black
ipas
they
seem
to
be
all
the
rage
and
this
one
was
unique
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
extremely
even
at
9
alcohol
this
beer
is
one
i
could
enjoy
multiple
times
in
a
night
this
beer
pours
an
opaque
black
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
moderate
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
grapefruit
and
pine
resin
with
traces
of
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
full
of
hops
but
the
part
i
like
most
is
the
roasted
malt
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
im
not
sure
what
an
imperial
black
ale
is
suppose
to
taste
like
but
i
am
sure
that
this
beer
works
pours
sinfully
dark
with
an
absolutely
huge
foamy
light
tan
head
that
fades
slowly
tons
of
belgian
lacing
left
behind
with
each
mouthful
is
that
to
style
ps
on
that
its
better
than
looking
through
a
pale
fizzy
yellow
beverage
the
smell
comes
across
to
me
like
a
candied
grassy
pine
huge
sweetness
behind
it
and
a
lemonvanilla
combination
ive
picked
up
on
that
common
thread
with
the
last
couple
of
beers
that
st
has
rolled
out
it
dominated
the
oakaged
unearthly
its
as
if
there
were
leftovers
from
the
brulee
full
flavored
the
taste
is
a
balance
of
extremes
big
tangy
grassy
lemon
minty
hops
married
with
an
overly
stated
sweetness
adequately
carbonated
the
mouth
feel
almost
burns
from
the
hop
and
alcohol
combo
that
hoppy
business
is
all
up
in
the
front
and
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
while
the
back
of
the
mouth
bathes
in
sweetness
it
gives
the
impression
of
being
lighter
in
body
the
taste
and
spicy
burn
lingers
significantly
a
really
interesting
beverage
i
hope
my
tastes
arent
changing
that
drastically
i
wasnt
looking
for
that
much
sweetness
the
9
abv
warmed
the
chest
nicely
totally
different
experience
than
xi
overall
another
exceptional
beer
from
st
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
they
never
cease
to
amaze
me
poured
fairly
black
but
with
red
highlights
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
when
held
up
to
light
the
super
thick
and
frothy
light
brown
head
was
crazy
the
lacing
was
also
thick
and
frothy
as
the
head
refused
to
leave
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
of
piney
hops
mixed
cough
syrup
kinda
tastes
liek
a
strong
ale
but
the
alcohol
taste
is
well
hidden
the
throat
warmth
is
present
though
this
is
quite
balanced
the
super
sweet
maltiness
is
balanced
by
the
piney
hops
feel
is
moderate
and
smooth
but
slightly
tingly
to
the
tounge
as
fun
as
this
is
to
describe
this
beer
almost
tastes
too
mild
like
there
is
too
much
balance
drinkable
but
the
plainest
strong
beer
ive
had
from
southern
tier
one
of
the
few
misfires
from
this
brewery
mouthfeel
is
is
medium
light
bodied
and
clean
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
drinks
very
easy
for
the
9
abv
very
tasty
mothman
and
i
wish
we
had
more
dark
mahogany
clear
thick
and
bubbly
light
brown
crop
of
froth
sits
on
top
retention
and
lacing
properties
are
very
good
great
aroma
of
chocolate
and
resiny
piney
hop
tones
this
fits
the
bill
for
a
black
ipa
closest
thing
ive
had
to
alpha
klaus
though
this
is
a
little
different
the
blackness
of
the
beer
and
the
hopness
off
the
beer
blend
really
nicely
roasted
and
chocolate
notes
are
form
the
malt
base
with
gooey
resiny
sticky
hop
traits
adding
great
character
the
body
is
about
medium
or
so
and
the
carbonation
is
fairly
restrained
very
easy
drinking
alcohol
damn
near
absent
in
this
quite
an
accomplishment
here
d
oh
yeah
9
where
gimme
another
overall
a
sweet
looking
dipa
with
a
sweeter
than
normal
taste
still
had
the
dipa
flavor
i
wanted
this
beer
to
never
be
finished
i
highly
recommend
d
it
goes
down
nice
and
easy
and
at
9
abv
thats
the
way
it
should
be
consumed
this
is
very
good
and
very
drinkable
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
terms
of
flavor
everything
is
balanced
out
very
well
with
the
hops
and
everything
else
playing
supporting
roles
with
each
other
and
just
weak
enough
in
abv
so
two
can
go
down
relatively
easy
i
havent
had
the
xi
by
stone
yet
but
so
far
this
is
the
best
of
this
style
ive
had
after
finishing
two
i
still
want
to
go
for
a
third
only
my
buzz
is
stopping
me
this
one
is
classified
on
ba
at
the
time
of
this
writing
as
a
black
dipa
i
say
this
doesnt
make
sense
considering
it
has
both
black
and
pale
in
the
name
i
like
the
idea
thats
presented
in
the
description
on
the
bottle
as
an
iba
or
india
black
ale
or
maybe
imperial
lets
stop
calling
these
beers
along
with
stones
11th
anniversary
ale
as
a
black
ipa
first
off
its
black
not
pale
also
there
is
no
history
in
this
beer
that
has
to
do
with
india
therefore
we
drop
the
i
and
the
p
so
that
leaves
us
with
black
a
or
black
ale
strictly
and
american
style
it
perfectly
fits
whats
a
porter
thats
basically
highly
hopped
we
can
put
this
beer
stone
11th
and
flying
dogs
gonzo
porter
in
this
area
you
can
have
a
black
ale
and
and
imperial
black
ale
which
would
fit
this
one
better
everything
makes
sense
i
know
recommended
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
oily
buttery
very
heavily
bodied
this
beer
is
strong
and
challenging
but
bursting
with
flavor
a
superior
beer
similar
in
styleflavor
to
stone
xi
anniversary
ale

ive
never
had
a
black
ipa
before
but
i
am
impressed
the
choice
of
hops
and
a
moderate
to
mild
roastiness
works
great
together
in
this
beer
a
little
rich
from
the
sweetness
brings
down
the
drinkability
a
tad
but
all
in
all
a
great
beer
m
d
a
medium
body
with
a
little
slickness
alcohol
is
hidden
very
nicely
though
the
flavours
linger
for
some
time
could
be
an
interesting
aging
candidate
even
though
its
a
hop
based
beer
pretty
nice
stuff
i
shared
this
with
a
friend
with
high
hopes
a
bit
of
a
let
down
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
black
but
not
opaquea
thinner
but
well
retained
off
white
head
atop
a
mix
of
left
coast
hop
and
bitter
chocolate
in
the
nosequite
bitter
and
earthy
not
the
hop
profile
i
was
hoping
for
on
the
palateit
left
me
wanting
more
big
earth
and
unsweetened
chocolate
on
the
palatethe
hops
seem
more
subdued
in
citric
form
a
nice
beer
but
it
left
me
wanting
more
drinkability
superb
beer
that
you
cant
put
down
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
differnt
big
ipa
this
is
the
beer
to
buy
dry
finish
makes
me
drink
this
one
quicker
than
i
should
by
the
time
i
sip
and
put
down
my
glass
im
ready
for
another
sip
good
sign
not
as
good
as
stone
ssr
but
still
pretty
decent
for
us
unfortunate
souls
who
dont
get
stone
in
our
distribution
network
reminds
me
a
little
of
gi
night
stalker
as
well
even
though
the
hops
used
are
different
d
this
one
gives
stone
11th
a
run
for
its
money
and
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
on
the
market
go
get
some
all
in
all
as
mentioned
it
has
some
earth
but
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
this
is
a
nice
calm
and
dare
i
say
it
balanced
offering
from
st
i
like
what
they
did
to
weed
out
the
patent
tannins
cool
overall
a
really
really
good
beer
this
was
a
shocker
for
me
as
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
come
across
as
good
as
it
did
really
another
very
good
offering
from
southern
tier
drinkability
moderate
at
best
the
alcohol
is
big
time
from
the
first
sip
but
the
delicious
taste
and
really
nice
feel
keep
me
going
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
fantastic
beer
none
the
less
reminds
me
of
old
man
winter
taken
to
the
extreme
d
i
dont
really
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
i
will
probally
never
buy
it
again
or
order
it
at
a
bar
overall
i
feel
this
beer
is
very
bland
not
a
single
charecteristic
shines
on
this
beer
a
unique
and
interesting
offering
from
southern
tier
the
bold
hoppy
character
of
this
brew
coupled
with
the
dark
color
is
a
cool
combination
not
something
that
other
breweries
havent
tried
out
but
a
very
nice
example
to
add
to
the
group
kudos
again
to
the
stbc
overall
interesting
juxtaposition
of
the
hoppiness
against
such
a
dark
palate
and
color
background
regardless
of
the
novelty
factor
this
is
a
damn
tasty
brew
with
a
good
deal
of
complexity
for
the
style

recommended

i
have
to
say
that
i
liked
it
but
i
didnt
love
it
i
usually
love
most
of
sts
big
beers
but
this
one
slightly
missed

mark

more

quality
brew
from
ny
state
d
goes
down
easy
enough
tastes
good
and
despite
the
high
abv
is
quite
quaffable
i
was
excited
to
see
this
on
the
shelf
of
whole
foods
in
chelsea
and
it
really
delivered
in
the
glass
i
cant
wait
for
more
from
southern
tier
this
may
be
my
favorite
yet
from
southern
tier
great
hop
aroma
and
flavor
perfectly
balanced
with
the
black
malt
the
aroma
as
soon
as
you
open
the
bottle
is
a
mix
of
citrusy
floral
with
malty
chocolate
the
taste
was
exceptional
as
you
drink
a
little
more
you
discover
all
the
flavors
this
beer
has
cant
even
tell
that
this
is
9
as
the
beer
warmed
up
it
got
a
little
more
malty
flavor
more
hop
taste
when
colder
easy
to
drink
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
draft
d
pretty
damn
drinkable
for
a
higher
abv
beer
really
complex
flavors
make
this
beer
unique
a
black
ipa
seemed
odd
to
me
i
kind
of
like
it
though
after
having
this
i
see
a
whole
new
style
to
enjoy
as
a
homebrewer
it
is
inspiring
as
a
craft
beer
drinker
it
is
comforting
drinkability
moderate
very
tasty
overall
the
balance
is
interesting
as
it
essentially
goes
from
one
end
of
the
spectrum
to
the
other
hop
to
malt
and
the
flavors
dont
necessarily
blend
but
follow
each
other
abv
is
a
bit
high
but
as
long
as
im
at
home
andor
not
driving
im
good
to
go
with
this
beer
on
tap
and
tasted
on
4909
drinkable
yep
damn
yummy
and
one
solid
brew
a
milk
porter
with
a
great
twist
of
hops
or
a
juicy
ipa
with
a
melange
of
dark
malts
whatever
it
is
so
deemed
in
style
its
great
one
of
the
few
fairly
priced
brews
from
southern
tier
to
hit
our
market
under
7
per
bomber
you
cant
go
wrong
the
beer
pours
a
black
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
lasts
the
aroma
is
awesome
the
hop
aroma
of
this
beer
is
out
of
this
world
it
has
a
huge
citrusfloral
scent
with
just
a
hint
of
black
malt
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
nice
pale
and
black
malt
flavor
thats
roasted
enough
to
give
it
color
but
doesnt
get
in
the
way
of
the
hops
it
has
such
a
fresh
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tremendous
beer
i
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
comparison
with
stones
version
of
the
same
style
recommended
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
but
i
also
think
that
southern
tier
has
the
makings
of
a
really
exceptional
one
with
a
few
tweaks
the
darker
malts
never
fully
come
together
with
the
hops
in
the
aroma
and
even
with
the
taste
they
dont
fully
complement
each
other
i
think
its
dry
hopped
a
bit
too
much
resulting
in
the
leafy
and
chalky
aftertaste
overall
i
think
they
need
to
try
to
marry
the
components
together
a
bit
better
and
if
they
succeed
theyll
have
a
real
winner
for
now
though
its
good
but
a
bit
of
a
jumbled
mess
my
first
southern
tier
experience
im
a
big
fan
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
well
done
highly
recommended
to
all
ipa
afficionados
southern
tier
iniquity
is
a
very
dark
nearly
black
ale
with
a
thick
foamy
light
brown
head
it
thins
out
a
little
but
stays
put
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
it
leaves
a
generous
thick
sheet
of
foam
all
the
way
down
the
glass
it
has
a
strong
citrus
aroma
thats
detected
from
arms
length
its
all
grapefruit
and
pine
it
is
mediumfull
bodied
and
incredibly
smooth
and
soft
in
the
mouth
it
tastes
squarely
between
sweet
and
dry
its
very
well
balanced
hoppy
but
not
overly
bitter
the
finish
seems
to
have
a
touch
of
roast
or
ash
it
is
thoroughly
enjoyable
and
unique
great
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
full
and
consistent
very
drinkable
overall
a
delicious
and
complex
dipa
would
definitely
have
this
again
its
delicious
but
obviously
not
a
session
beer
iniquity
can
be
added
to
the
long
and
ever
growing
list
of
great
southern
tier
offerings
d
at
9
abv
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
i
really
love
this
beer
i
wouldnt
call
it
extreme
but
its
really
fun
to
drink
light
roasted
malt
flavors
up
front
sweet
dark
fruits
follow
before
big
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
takes
over
very
resinous
with
herbal
notes
and
pineapple
near
the
end
theres
almost
a
dark
chocolate
and
vanilla
thing
going
on
as
well
some
fruity
malt
lingers
in
the
otherwise
bitter
finish
fullbodied
with
a
creamy
smooth
feel
very
nice
mix
of
lightly
roasted
notes
and
big
time
hops
the
finish
is
bitter
with
unsweetend
chocolate
husky
grains
and
some
hops
but
the
hops
are
now
mostly
drowned
out
by
the
smoky
bittering
flavors
more
hops
less
smokey
black
grain
huskyness
antithesis
of
unearthly
sure
why
not
obviously
theyre
looking
for
people
to
try
them
together
perhaps
ill
update
if
i
try
it
notes
the
keg
kicked
while
i
was
at
lionheart
last
night
based
on
that
and
the
fact
that
i
heard
quite
a
few
people
ordering
it
earlier
it
seems
to
be
popular
i
can
understand
why
another
winner
from
st
worth
seeking
out
d
took
a
while
to
get
through
the
pint
but
it
was
really
enjoyable
i
have
been
a
little
disappointed
with
southern
tier
stuff
lately
but
i
think
it
has
more
to
do
with
my
high
expectations
from
them
this
is
a
great
and
singular
beer
worth
seeking
out
was
able
to
give
this
a
try
tonight
while
visiting
mahars
brew
poured
to
a
nice
black
color
with
some
reddish
highlights
thick
medium
tan
colored
head
that
had
great
retention
and
left
a
ton
of
lacing
the
aroma
well
i
really
cant
get
past
the
hops
nice
mix
of
citrus
and
pine
aromas
that
clearly
dominate
but
are
so
inviting
maybe
some
coffee
aroma
there
but
i
am
having
a
difficult
time
getting
past
the
hops
as
mentioned
above
the
flavor
real
nice
again
the
hops
are
at
the
front
with
the
coffee
making
a
clearer
appearance
here
than
was
in
the
nose
never
really
sense
an
alcohol
feel
to
this
one
overall
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
like
the
darker
malt
profile
though
it
was
hard
to
pick
up
the
properties
past
the
hops
i
will
get
this
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beers
body
is
medium
the
carbonation
is
moderate
and
works
well
with
the
beer
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
layered
a
very
nice
beer
drinking
experience
another
new
beer
from
southern
tier
a
dark
dipa
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
this
becomes
a
popular
style
soon
fast
pour
reveals
a
solid
looking
black
beer
with
about
a
finger
of
slightly
tanned
white
heading
despite
its
blackness
there
seems
to
be
a
clarity
about
it
in
color
if
that
makes
any
sense
pretty
decent
smell
i
get
from
it
some
mild
chocolate
little
metallic
twang
and
some
alcohol
bitterness
taste
is
more
centered
in
hop
flavor
but
for
an
imperial
ipa
sorry
iba
there
is
a
very
good
level
of
balance
the
dark
malt
manages
to
stay
behind
the
hops
but
still
smooth
things
out
alcohol
is
hardly
present
in
this
one
had
somebody
told
me
it
was
9
i
might
not
have
believed
them
like
i
said
the
well
hidden
alcohol
and
balance
between
malt
and
hops
both
combine
to
make
this
an
easy
drinking
ale
this
is
a
very
respectable
effort
from
southern
tier
i
liked
the
fact
that
it
was
balanced
as
opposed
to
hop
overkill
please
continue
to
experiment
poured
from
a
650ml
bottle
with
a
clear
printed
label
im
glad
southern
tier
moved
away
from
printing
ink
directly
on
the
glass
it
didnt
work
too
well
the
beer
is
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
along
the
border
some
wet
offwhite
foam
that
laces
all
over
the
glass
the
beer
smells
like
a
strongly
hopped
schwarz
bier
citrus
pine
over
a
roasted
malt
body
the
taste
is
really
good
much
better
than
stone
11th
in
my
opinion
more
than
just
a
dark
ipa
this
was
tasty
in
a
complex
way
that
included
roasted
malts
and
chocolate
to
offset
the
citrus
character
of
the
hops
very
nice
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
keeps
me
coming
back
to
southern
tier
22
ounce
bottle
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
i
can
smell
a
lot
of
citrusy
and
piney
hops
theres
also
some
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
dark
fruit
noticable
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
citrus
and
pine
hop
flavors
being
strongest
i
can
also
taste
some
bready
and
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
too
the
malty
flavors
get
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
but
theres
still
a
lingering
hoppy
bitter
finish
mouthfeelbody
is
mediumfull
its
creamy
and
a
bit
slick
with
moderate
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
isnt
very
noticable
at
all
this
is
a
very
unique
brew
and
i
liked
it
a
lot
to
me
i
think
this
brew
is
a
great
mix
between
a
schwarzbier
a
stout
and
an
imperial
ipa
but
thats
just
my
opinion
it
really
is
a
hard
to
describe
beer
you
just
have
to
try
it
for
yourself
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
lately
wow
this
is
an
excellent
beer
im
not
sure
if
its
the
coffee
or
the
1
to
2
drop
off
in
alcohol
but
for
a
change
i
dont
feel
worn
out
from
the
obvious
alcohol
its
slightly
noticeable
after
half
a
glass
but
for
the
most
part
this
beer
is
surprisingly
drinkable
given
the
abv
impressive
iniquity
is
quite
the
interesting
beer
its
good
perhaps
very
good
but
i
cant
help
but
think
about
what
could
have
been
the
spicy
hop
flavor
really
cuts
into
and
overtakes
a
more
appealing
citrus
flavor
its
interesting
the
citrus
hops
just
begin
to
take
hold
and
then
theyre
gone
iniquity
is
injustice
or
an
immoral
act
perhaps
suppressing
that
really
nice
citrus
hop
flavor
is
southern
tiers
poetic
injustice
all
kidding
aside
iniquity
is
a
nice
beer
it
really
is
very
good
but
its
not
quite
as
good
as
it
couldve
been
just
sayin
pours
an
expected
black
color
with
a
small
tanoff
white
head
more
malts
in
the
nose
than
i
thought
there
would
be
a
sweetness
met
with
a
moderate
hop
aroma
malt
dominant
initially
fruity
and
semi
sweet
notes
of
raison
and
plum
shallow
hops
no
where
near
as
bright
as
i
had
hoped
for
i
was
and
still
am
pretty
amped
for
this
one
but
so
far
it
has
let
me
down
i
will
definitely
revisit
in
hopes
of
a
better
outcome
d
different
than
anything
i
have
ever
encountered
and
a
challenge
to
review
its
a
dipa
that
doesnt
know
if
it
wants
to
be
a
stout
or
not
very
unique
and
something
that
i
loved
drinking
and
will
check
out
again
in
the
near
future
another
one
tonight
would
be
a
problem
because
of
the
strength
not
extremely
drinkable
not
bad
on
drinkability
almost
finished
with
the
bottle
it
went
down
quite
easily
d
reminds
me
of
a
schwarzier
hopped
to
dipa
levels
very
tasty
like
unearthly
with
some
black
malt
tossed
in
wow
this
is
tasty
the
malts
come
through
much
more
than
many
other
black
ipas
ive
had
thick
malts
with
hints
of
roasted
quality
and
a
chocolatey
sense
burnt
caramel
as
well
through
the
beginning
and
middle
late
into
the
middle
and
through
the
long
finish
the
hops
devour
the
palate
and
bring
things
together
with
the
malts
showing
a
bit
of
sweetness
on
the
very
end
a
roller
coaster
type
ride
on
the
palate
hops
are
more
piney
in
the
mouth
with
some
spicy
qualities
as
well
only
a
bit
a
citrus
is
distinguishable
in
the
very
mid
palate
a
very
complex
beer
a
beer
wellworth
drinking
i
got
to
taste
it
the
day
before
it
was
being
bottled
md
rather
drinkable
and
not
at
all
too
big
even
with
a
serious
palate
and
highish
abv
well
done
southern
tier
i
recommend
this
beer
try
it
out
o
a
fantastic
beer
stellar
balance
of
roast
sweetness
and
bitters
for
a
style
that
all
too
often
goes
roasty
for
roasty
sake
drying
wonderfully
only
the
shell
of
malt
leaves
its
starchy
substrate
behind
which
supports
the
earthen
rye
bite
the
acute
pine
bitterness
and
roasted
acidity
extremely
well
pretending
to
be
imperial

light

really

over

evolved
quickly
into

a

it
is

eaten
alive

as
i
taste
the
beer
it

with

and
some
roasted

flavor
flows
seemlessly
into
the

at

the

this
is
a
solid
black
ale
i
personally
find
the
style
to
be
a
little
goofy
there
is
just
so
much
flavor
packed
into
a
beer
that
it
all
just
sort
of
falls
together
i
dont
know
if
its
just
me
but
they
seem
a
little
muddled
they
still
taste
good
but
they
all
sort
of
taste
the
same
to
me
its
taken
a
few
to
understand
it
but
i
think
for
me
most
part
its
hard
to
make
a
black
ale
that
is
different

it
is
definitetly
an
ipa

is
tempered
by
the
rye
i
have
never
personally
had
a
rye
beer
but
this
seems
to
be
a
good
hybrid
between
the
two
i
think
this
could
be
a
good
hybrid
of
the
two
styles
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
but
will
surely
buy
a
couple
of
bottles
every
year

may

medium
body
and
carbonation
overall
an
enjoyable
black
ipa
by
alaskan
there
was
a
good
amount
of
roasted
malts
and
hops
a
good
dark
ale
overall
with
a
decent
use
of
hops
all
around
there
is
a
slight
colalike
quality
towards
the
finish
but
the
malt
grain
richness
and
hop
bitterness
win
out
overall
while
most
black
ipas
come
down
on
the
side
of
light
this
one
comes
down
on
the
side
of
dark
and
sort
of
comes
off
like
a
hoppy
porter
or
stout
a
different
take
on
it
but
a
tasty
one
i
thought
o
fairly
pleasant
beer
and
very
easy
drinking
pretty
complex
also
i
could
see
myself
session
this
one
especially
at
6
99
for
a
6
pack
from
the
bottle
and
into
the
doublewalled
bodum
glass
it
poured
an
almostblack
dark
brown
which
looked
deep
red
when
held
up
to
the
light
it
created
nearly
an
inch
of
frothy
tan
head
which
left
remarkable
lacing
as
it
went
down
the
glass
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
quite
enjoyable
dark
chocolate
raisins
caramel
pine
and
moss
all
come
through
very
well
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
however
is
somewhat
overwhelming
in
the
taste
behind
the
earthy
piney
notes
of
the
hops
there
is
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
the
impression
that
some
of
the
complexity
of
the
aroma
is
also
in
the
taste
its
just
a
bit
overpowered
i
thought
the
beer
had
good
carbonation
and
had
a
pleasant
body
but
nevertheless
felt
a
touch
light
on
my
tongue
overall
i
expected
a
bit
more
but
i
enjoyed
every
bottle
in
the
pack
i
will
be
trying
other
black
ipas
for
sure
but
ill
think
twice
about
buying
this
one
again
unless
there
are
no
other
options
alaskan
black
ipa
is
certainly
a
tasty
beer
and
it
rates
a
notch
better
than
other
black
ipa
i
have
tried
it
is
less
balanced
than
others
with
a
greater
reliance
on
the
hops
but
that
fact
should
not
dissuade
anyone
from
sampling
it
as
its
taste
is
still
very
good
and
memorable
the
complexity
and
other
factors
make
this
ale
one
for
the
record
and
one
everyone
should
add
to
their
list
of
beers
to
try
o
wow
ive
had
this
one
fresh
and
it
is
great
then
as
a
big
hoppy
dark
ale
but
now
once
the
hops
have
faded
the
malt
complexities
are
great
the
sweet
dark
cherry
and
chocolate
notes
to
contrast
the
bright
bitter
coffee
and
light
hop
notes
are
just
great
this
is
truly
underrated
o
i
liked
this
black
ipa
a

id
buy
it

nothing

zero
cloying

medium
carbonation
and

with
a
lightly

sticky
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ipa
nice
complexity
and
good
balance
of
hopmalt
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
taste
is
big
on
the
hop
flavor
and
surprisingly
low
on
bitterness
for
me
sometimes
the
roasty
char
and
hop
bitterness
can
be
a
bit
much
but
this
one
has
a
nice
mellow
bitterness
the
malts
actually
have
a
touch
of
chocolate
that
is
nice
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
but
it
seems
to
work
in
the
beers
favor
for
some
reason
this
black
ipa
might
be
more
simplistic
than
many
of
the
style
but
i
find
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
and
manages
something
rarely
accomplished
for
those
of
the
cascadian
persuasion
its
refreshing
id
buy
this
again
yizeah
i
would
have
this
again
a
nice
offering
from
this
brewery
not
sure
if
this
is
my
first
from
them
or
not
but
ive
been
meaning
to
try
this
one
for
a
while
really
do
like
it
but
its
hard
to
distinguish
from
a
porter
overall
bold
smell
doesnt
quite
translate
to
taste
still
quite
a
good
beer
with
easy
sessionability
an
enjoyable
black
ipa
though
overall
it
doesnt
stand
out
for
the
style
in
any
particular
way
this
is
a
very
delicious
well
rounded
brew
a
session
ipa
i
like
the
darker
malt
quality
of
it
ok
dark
amber
head
remains
slight
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malts
big
carbonation
remains
almost
in
the
way
of
the
dark
roasted
malts
ill
admit
i
like
many
black
ipas
like
hop
strike
from
tommyknocker
or
stones
black
ipa
and
this
one
is
darn
tasty
rich
roasted
malts
slight
sweetness
robust
hops
in
a
nice
balance
like
a
export
stout
with
extra
west
coast
hops
like
a
burnt
porter
gone
hoppy
like
a
beer
i
want
to
bring
to
my
mouth
again
and
again
in
my
mind
a
brilliant
balance
not
a
giant
in
abv
which
is
fine
but
big
in
flavor
and
richness
heck
a
good
competitor
with
my
current
regular
house
brand
sierra
nevada
torpedo
extra
ipa
humm
i
think
i
could
say
i
like
this
more
overall
an
ok
black
ipa
on
the
spectrum
this
isnt
quite
a
red
ale
nor
is
it
a
hoppy
porter
but
it
has
aspects
i
like
from
both
of
the
stylessome
piney
dank
notes
a
light
roast
malt
thats
not
overly
sweetwhich
work
for
me
a
mixed
bag
to
be
sure
but
one
id
grab
again
o
the
first
black
ipa
i
fell
in
love
with
this
is
a
12pack
purchase
once
a
season
for
sure
its
body
and
hop
flavor
are
balanced
and
the
pushed
over
with
the
hops
and
its
a
great
example
of
what
this
style
shall
develop
into
cheers
to
the
alaskan
brewery
on
this
one
overall
a
good
beer
from
these
guys
not
their
best
in
my
opinion
but
certainly
one
worth
trying
its
a
nice
brew
im
glad
i
took
the
chance
on
a
sixer
ive
had
other
alaskan
brews
before
tho
and
its
a
good
brewery
o
a
decent
beer
but
would
like
a
little
roasted
barley
presence
for
those
that
like
a
good
hop
character
but
have
grown
bored
with
obnoxiously
hopped
beers
oh
wow
how
original
might
give
this
one
a
shake
i
would
buy
this
again
especially
since
they
are
6
99
a
sixer
i
usually
buy
just
tx
stuff
but
there
arent
really
black
ipas
available
in
bottlescans
at
this
time
bottle
was
dated
good
until
late
april
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
well
done
black
ipa
i
closed
my
eyes
and
took
a
drink
and
it
really
does
taste
like
a
pale
ipa
yet
its
black
this
is
how
a
black
ipa
ought
to
be
a
worthy
and
flavorful
bipa
overall
a
very
underrated
cda
from
alaskan
here
personally
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
of
the
roasted
character
but
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
regardless
my
only
gripe
is
that
this
isnt
a
yearround
release
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
black
color
with
a
nice
looking
mocha
colored
head
on
top
the
head
had
a
decent
retention
to
it
as
well
as
a
light
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
a
really
nice
blend
of
roasted
chocolate
malt
with
piney
hops
on
the
nose
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
between
the
roasted
notes
as
well
as
the
hops
that
were
used
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
still
kept
me
interested
overall
its
actually
a
pretty
nice
brew
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
again
id
say
this
was
more
of
your
average
black
ipa
but
i
would
have
it
again
that
could
be
because
i
seem
to
love
black
ipas
but
still
much
better
for
me
than
the
regular
alaskan
ipa
very
dark
brown
in
color
nearly
black
with
a
light
tan
head
nose
is
a
bit
sweet
with
licorice
dark
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
very
light
hoppiness
theres
some
caramel
and
molasses
in
there
maybe
a
bit
of
an
earthy
hop
note
the
flavor
is
quite
sweet
with
lots
of
molasses
and
toffee
decently
roasty
with
a
light
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
as
well
as
some
chocolate
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
kind
of
black
ipa
c
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
had
it
on
tap
at
old
chicago
back
in
march
and
it
was
much
better
fresh
well
see
if
alaskan
comes
out
with
this
in
the
future
if
they
do
grab
it
fresh
if
you
can
overall
i
am
quite
happy
wish
i
could
find
this
one
here
in
mi
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
have
no
problem
spending
the
money
on
quite
happily
surprised
would
recommend
i
had
this
once
on
tap
and
found
it
very
stoutlike
now
that
i
have
formally
reviewed
a
bottle
of
it
i
still
agree
with
that
assessment
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
if
you
like
stouts
porters
or
beers
with
hops
and
lots
of
roasted
dark
malts
i
would
happily
drink
this
again
especially
at
this
price
i
like
this
its
beer
and
you
can
drink
it
o
this
is
a
very
good
dark
ale
the
appearance
is
stunning
the
smell
inviting
the
taste
delightful
and
wellbalanced
and
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
pleasant
despite
having
more
of
a
bite
than
i
would
like
d
solid
and
easy
drinking
black
ipa
nice
balance
of
roast
and
hops
very
good
beer
served
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
nice
sized
light
tan
foamy
frothy
head
that
settled
slowly
and
loads
of
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
clear
mahoganey
aroma
is
malt
roast
hop
flavor
is
surpisingly
mild
yet
fairly
good
balance
and
similar
to
nose
with
the
usual
hop
malt
tart
characteristics
standing
out
in
context
with
the
body
which
is
full
and
has
slight
high
points
from
the
acidbitter
rounded
peaks
finish
is
like
flavor
of
average
length
and
is
easy
drinking
overall
good
but
not
sure
how
this
fits
into
the
profile
of
a
black
ipa
i
do
like
it
and
would
have
it
again
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
for
me
too
much
malts
and
hops
going
on
at
the
same
time
one
finger
creamy
light
tan
head
slow
dissipation
with
significant
lacing
over
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
opaque
body
citrusy
hops
dominate
nose
roast
malt
not
very
noticeable
until
the
beer
fully
warmed
taste
features
good
dose
of
coffeeish
roast
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
floral
overtones
certainly
more
roast
than
hops
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
creamy
decent
effervescence
not
quite
hoppy
enough
for
me
but
one
of
the
smoother
cdas
ive
had
worth
a
try
a
solid
cdablack
ipa
i
think
the
taste
is
great
and
even
the
look
but
there
is
just
something
a
little
too
thick
about
it
that
makes
it
hard
to
drink
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
guzzle
a
few
pints
of
a
good
cda
on
occasion
but
with
this
puppy
i
may
switch
to
another
light
drinker
as
for
the
alaskan
version
of
this
ipaanddarkbeerlovers
treat
it
gets
a
b
where
it
has
two
great
distinct
flavors
that
mix
well
together
it
lacks
complexity
beyond
that
its
deepest
flavor
disappears
all
too
quickly
leaving
nothing
but
the
hops
to
rest
on
the
tounge
ive
had
a
few
black
ipas
now
and
im
still
convinced
theyre
a
gimmick
style
alaskan
black
ipa
is
a
nice
ipa
that
just
happens
to
be
black
instead
of
yelloworange
im
not
knocking
the
beer
its
good
just
the
style
took
me
a
while
to
find
the
description
on
the
alaskan
website
under
spring
release
that
i
drank
in
january
alaskan
emphasizes
the
high
hops
and
citrus
though
my
draft
was
understated
compared
to
the
touting
however
my
experience
was
significantly
better
than
the
reviews
on
beeradvocate
while
there
are
those
who
reflect
my
high
praise
we
are
in
the
minority
maybe
i
need
to
try
it
again
to
confirm
or
deny
my
first
draft
o
i
remember
it
being
much
better
out
of
the
bottle
i
pulled
the
glass
straight
out
of
the
dishwasher
which
is
a
rookie
move
so
im
thinking
that
affected
the
taste
this
is
a
good
beer
just
not
good
enough
to
buy
another
six
pack
to
prove
my
theory
incorrect
id
try
it
again
on
draft
though
i
always
enjoy
hitting
the
west
coast
since
i
almost
always
find
something
from
alaskan
that
i
havent
tried
yet
very
dark
brown
but
still
clear
with
a
deep
ruby
hue
a
short
cap
of
tanbrown
bubbles
capped
the
beer
fair
retention
quite
sticky
this
ones
more
roasty
than
hoppy
though
theres
some
grassy
character
in
the
aroma
it
smells
kind
of
sweet
though
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
licorice
same
in
the
flavour
but
with
some
pine
mixing
in
with
the
licorice
and
sweetness
bitterness
was
moderate
a
little
less
pronounced
than
i
expected
smooth
lowish
carbonation
medium
body
nice
texture
its
quite
drinkable
but
maybe
at
the
expense
of
blowing
my
socks
off
with
character
all
kidding
aside
its
an
enjoyable
beer
overall
those
wanting
something
big
bodacious
and
obnoxious
will
be
disappointed
what
we
have
here
is
a
sublimely
balanced
and
delicately
layered
version
of
this
hard
to
define
style
ive
had
a
hard
time
with
this
style
but
i
find
this
offering
as
something
i
wish
i
could
have
sampled
earlier
because
its
seemingly
a
solid
base
model
for
others
to
build
and
expand
on
definitley
recommended
o
its
a
decent
beer
black
ipas
imo
are
hard
to
pull
off
this
sort
of
works
easy
drinking
o
decent
black
ipa
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
try
it
but
probably
wont
revisit
ng
black
top
has
perhaps
spoiled
me
a
bit
pours
a
deep
coffee
hue
with
bits
of
burgundy
finger
of
mocha
head
and
very
average
lacing
on
the
nose
i
get
some
nuts
subtle
chocolate
toasted
grains
hops
are
pretty
understated
the
hops
take
on
a
stronger
character
on
the
tongue
but
lack
direction
they
fade
into
abstract
bitterness
before
taking
on
much
shape
the
dark
malts
are
nice
though
i
could
be
fooled
into
thinking
that
theres
a
bit
of
coffee
in
this
one
a
decent
brew
poured
cola
brown
with
a
nice
cap
of
tan
foam
that
laced
up
decently
smell
is
pleasantly
roasty
citric
and
a
bit
of
pine
resin
taste
is
acerbic
bitterness
in
a
background
of
roasted
malt
once
the
initial
hit
of
hop
fades
the
malt
portion
of
the
brew
is
quite
nice
and
roasty
with
hints
of
coffee
however
the
hop
profile
is
a
little
discordant
especially
on
the
first
few
sips
mouthfeel
is
decently
slick
medium
bodied
the
pith
bitterness
shows
up
again
during
the
finish
overall
this
one
improves
marginally
about
half
way
through
the
glass
once
the
buds
get
accustomed
ie
desensitized
to
the
hop
profile
pours
an
almost
opaque
super
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
some
pine
and
herbal
hops
taste
is
of
the
pineherbal
hops
up
front
with
the
dark
roasted
malt
flavor
coming
through
on
the
finish
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
flavor
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
there
is
a
medium
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
but
the
body
is
somewhat
thin
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
ive
had
better
black
ipas
with
more
complexity
of
flavor
than
this
but
than
again
ive
also
had
black
ipas
that
were
much
worse
than
this
ymmv
as
always
mouthfeel
bitterness
stays
with
you
too
long
for
my
taste
overall
the
person
who
referred
this
particular
beer
to
me
hyped
it
a
lot
so
i
went
into
it
with
heightened
expectations
i
must
say
that
it
lived
up
to
his
praise
and
i
have
found
a
solid
black
ipa
to
add
to
my
library
definitely
worth
the
shade
under
10
price
tag
for
a
6pack
we
paid
at
a
local
speciality
beer
store
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
at
all
and
somewhat
interesting
but
not
terribly
intriguing
overall
a
decent
black
ipa
kind
of
reserved
but
balanced
part
of
gift
six
pack
from
presario
and
a
recent
trip
to
montana
much
like
their
regular
ipa
is
not
a
assertive
beer
but
like
all
alaskan
products
is
well
made
doesnt
taste
that
much
different
than
a
stout
and
a
little
disappointing
but
easily
could
revisit
this
other
comments
this
is
a
beautiful
black
ipa
or
as
i
prefer
to
call
them
cascadian
dark
ale
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
just
a
good
first
experience
with
a
beer
i
have
never
had
it
did
not
have
any
metallic
or
harsh
notes
that
i
was
concerned
about
i
bought
the
sixer
that
freddys
had
but
it
turned
out
there
was
only
4
of
these
black
ipas
in
there
in
pouring
the
cda
in
the
glass
it
was
pitch
black
with
a
nice
23
finger
head
the
smell
was
citrusy
and
it
had
a
solid
bitterness
to
mouth
the
alphas
left
on
tongue
lingered
for
a
while
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
and
it
has
been
a
few
months
since
i
had
one
usually
this
is
a
summer
beer
for
me
from
the
12
oz
twistcap
bottle
cost
6
00
for
a
10
oz
pour
im
a
big
fan
of
alaskans
ipa
as
a
standard
and
cheap
ipa
so
when
i
noticed
they
had
a
black
ipa
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
its
an
interesting
mix
ive
enjoyed
many
new
black
lagers
lately
and
this
is
just
the
same
its
like
a
cross
between
a
porter
and
an
ipa
and
i
find
it
a
tasty
very
drinkable
concoction
if
youre
a
fan
of
either
style
i
definitely
recommend
over
all
a
very
drinkable
brew
from
alaskan
and
much
much
better
than
their
regular
ipa
overall
a
nice
beer
and
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
worth
trying
overall
not
really
sure
this
should
be
called
a
black
ipa
or
even
a
catchall
american
black
ale
this
is
really
a
porter
with
higher
bitterness
and
some
mild
americanstyle
hops
i
enjoy
it
but
a
little
misleading
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
its
full
of
flavor
and
the
hop
characteristics
come
off
very
fresh
i
think
i
would
like
a
little
less
carbonation
but
thats
about
all
i
can
complain
about
if
your
a
hop
head
give
this
one
a
try
cheers
o
a
affordable
alternative
to
stones
black
ipa
offering
perfect
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
that
i
think
brings
more
to
the
table
than
alaskans
regular
ipa

keeps
interest
nicely
a
black

id
buy
again
which
is
a
fairly
rare
thing
o
real
easy
to
drink
leans
more
toward
the
roasted
malt
side
but
there
is
certainly
a
hops
presense
overall
a
nice
beer

1
75
mahogany
coloured
beer
with
a
small
wispy
tan

degenerates
into
lace
within
seconds
almost
no
aroma
what
there
is
is
dusty
chocolate
malts
vestiges
of
herbal
hop
taste
is
also
very
weak
like
a
watered
down
porter
again
just
vestiges
of
any
sort
of
hop
i
guess
its
ok
on
the
palate
just
weak
overall
one
of
the
worst
cdas
i
have
had
come
on
alaskan
you
can
do
much
much
better
o
lacks
complexity
and
could
use
more
roast
and
chocolate
malts
also
hops
could
come
through
a
bit
more
o
a
tasty
black
ipa
easily
drinkable
and
nicely
balanced
certainly
worthy
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
nicely
hopped
with
a
solid
roasted
malty
backbone
overall
tasty
but
this
beer
needs
some
refinement
in
my
opinion
its
just
a
bit
messy
which
limits
how
much
of
it
i
want
to
drink
i
was
excited
to
try
this
as
i
enjoyed
the
black
ipa
from
their
pilot
series
last
year
the
beer
is
a
nice
black
with
red
hues
and
a
nice
tan
foam
presence
smells
like
a
sweet
porter
mixed
with
grassy
and
resiny
hops
maybe
the
slightest
hint
of
peppery
notes
the
flavor
follows
through
with
a
nice
and
complimentary
style
of
east
meets
west
kinda
fusion
i
dig
the
flavor
profile
in
that
neither
the
malts
nor
the
hops
dominate
this
one
its
well
balanced
in
a
classy
and
appropriate
fashion
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
full
with
some
fine
and
soft
carbonation
i
like
the
beer
i
like
many
of
aks
beers
and
im
happy
to
have
this
in
the
spring
lineup
id
drink
this
all
night
easy
and
smooth
very
good
beer
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
a
cascadian
dark
ale
that
leans
more
toward
the
malty
side
of
the
equation
with
just
enough
hops
to
leave
me
completely
unwanting
a
delicious
sweet
treat
d
its
definitely
an
inspired
beer
melding
two
styles
it
suffers
a
bit
from
simplicity
but
its
high
quality
and
highly
drinkable
i
picked
up
a
twelve
pack
of
this
beer
for
12
49
very
decent
price
dark
black
color
good
tan
head
with
a
lot
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
a
little
grassy
and
a
lot
like
a
porter
the
taste
is
cool
grassy
hops
and
then
a
porterlike
backbone
i
find
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
have
a
huge
clash
between
the
hops
and
the
malts
not
the
case
here
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
beer
i
would
say
it
seems
more
like
a
hoppy
porter
but
i
will
buy
this
again
especially
if
i
can
get
a
good
deal
on
a
twelve
pack
again
where
were
the
hops
theres
no
way
this
passes
at
an
ipa
glad
it
is
not
catergorized
as
such
interesting
melody
in
the
aroma
but
not
much
hop
backing
very
roasty
but
malt
heavy
and
thin
not
bad
but
not
memorable
either
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
slightly
thick
overall
not
too
bad
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
nice
beer
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
the
other
day
pours
a
cola
dark
brown
colour
with
a
big
three
finger
head
nice
little
hoppy
aroma
with
mixed
with
malty
roast
has
almost
a
rootbeerbubblegum
taste
to
it
slight
roasty
balance
at
the
end
overall
a
nice
black
ipa
i
will
be
sure
too
try
more
of
this
style
in
the
future
not
bad
alaskan
though
i
liked
your
pilot
series
version
of
this
beer
much
more
drinkable
and
cheap
but
not
too
memorable
pours
a
deep
redbrown
color
with
a
1
tan
head
head
leaves
some
lacing
as
it
recedes
to
a
thick
film
smell
is
roasty
and
citric
tastes
strongly
of
roasted
malt
with
citric
and
pine
flavors
coming
in
at
the
beginning
and
leaving
a
bitterness
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
average
carbonation
this
is
a
good
cda
but
i
feel
there
are
others
that
drink
better
enjoyable
beer
nothing
to
complain
about
here
overall
a
good
tasting
ipa
could
of
been
a
little
stronger
with
the
dark
roasty
elements
but
whats
there
tastes
good
o
a
well
intentioned
effort
but
its
just
middle
of
the
road
at
best
at
least
it
wasnt
a
new
black
ipa
that
was
priced
through
the
roof
which
was
refreshing
poured
from
bottle
undated
to
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
very
solid
blackbrown
color
with
a
creamy
1
finger
tan
head
with
pleasant
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
presents
a
good
mix
of
citrusy
hops
and
chocolately
malt
character
hop
forward
but
not
over
the
top
quite
nice
the
flavor
consists
of
very
much
the
same
powdery
cocoa
with
mild
bitterness
and
a
good
amount
of
citrus
hop
character
mild
toasty
malt
presence
well
balanced
medium
bodied
with
a
mouthfeel
of
soft
creaminess
finishes
with
a
slight
chalky
texture
but
is
relatively
smooth
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
excellent
representation
of
the
style
look
forward
to
the
next
o
falls
short
of
a
black
ipa
let
alone
a
regular
ipa
for
sure
maybe
im
spoiled
by
more
expensive
beers
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
overall
im
not
that
well
versed
on
black
ales
even
less
so
with
black
ipas
from
what
i
have
had
though
this
seems
to
be
a
very
accessible
representation
of
the
style
which
i
have
come
to
expect
from
alaskan
brewing
as
an
earlyspring
seasonal
when
its
still
really
winter
i
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
approaches
a
porter
but
gives
me
some
of
the
floral
hops
to
remind
me
that
spring
is
coming
a
little
tacky
sure
but
i
would
buy
this
again
really
inoffensive
and
mild
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
but
theres
just
not
much
going
on
here
overall
this
is
a
decent
black
ipa
i
would
like
a
little
more
depth
to
it
maybe
more
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
maybe
more
of
a
hop
presence
i
know
they
can
do
it
because
their
double
black
ipa
pilot
series
is
still
one
of
my
favorite
black
ipas
to
date
35
o
a
decent
black
ipa
but
not
anything
particularly
amazing
some
people
criticize
this
style
for
just
being
hoppy
porters
that
seems
to
be
the
case
here
taste
nice
good
hop
bitterness
a
little
less
roast
at
this
point
missing
the
fruity
hop
character
that
makes
the
best
black
ales
shine
this
one
leaned
a
little
much
on
simple
grassy
bitterness
sometimes
the
dehusked
black
malt
just
doesnt
get
enough
of
the
acrid
bitterness
out
of
it
and
as
a
result
covers
up
a
little
hop
flavor
because
of
that
this
could
just
as
much
be
called
an
american
porter
might
not
have
the
thickness
youd
want
but
in
the
more
sesssionable
porters
they
tend
to
be
weaker
in
mouthfeel
this
is
just
fine
for
style
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
approachable
for
the
style
that
ive
had
seems
all
of
alaskans
regular
and
seasonal
beers
are
made
this
way
though
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
one
and
would
have
it
again
o
great
black
ipa
def
on
the
high
end
of
bitterness
could
maybe
use
a
bit
more
flavor
to
go
with
it
though
160th
alaskan
brewing
company
is
adding
to
their
winter
and
summer
seasonal
line
with
the
introduction
of
alaskan
black
ipa
a
spring
seasonal
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
porterlike
with
a
not
quite
tan
head
that
leaves
a
decent
lacing
piney
resiny
citrus
hops
aromas
fill
the
nostrils
with
dark
coffee
like
scents
poking
through
roasty
malt
flavors
dominate
the
pallet
at
first
with
lighter
chocolate
and
citrus
flavors
balancing
out
the
somewhat
bitter
finish
a
somewhat
lighter
body
is
met
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
well
balanced
version
of
a
style
that
continues
to
get
more
and
more
entrants
and
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
those
spring
alaskan
nights
o
not
my
favorite
iba
so
far
but
still
good
i
prefer
this
style
to
have
loud
hop
presence
with
quite
and
gentle
chocolate
flavors
it
just
seemed
a
little
to
balanced
for
my
liking
must
be
a
newer
one
from
these
guys
only
the
tenth
review
pours
a
nice
brown
aleporter
color
with
a
2
inch
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
smells
less
like
an
ipa
and
more
like
a
black
lager
or
something
tons
of
roast
in
the
aroma
not
as
much
hops
as
may
beers
in
this
genre
flavor
too
plenty
hoppy
but
its
not
dominant
balanced
by
dark
malt
and
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
for
the
style
very
approachable
and
drinkable
much
more
of
a
hoppy
porter
or
something
than
a
black
ipa
as
i
traditionally
think
of
them
as
the
hops
just
isnt
the
main
focus
for
me
solid
brew
o
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
love
the
alaskan
brewery
but
there
our
others
i
would
prefer
if
i
had
to
drink
a
bipa
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
bipa
not
the
best
and
by
far
not
the
worst
in
the
class
worth
a
try
all
4s
overall
this
is
a
solid
attempt
at
a
black
ale
the
flavors
are
all
there
but
could
maybe
cleaned
up
a
little
o
this
is
a
nice
cascadian
darkblack
ipa
it
doesnt
overdo
the
roasted
malts
like
some
tend
to
the
piney
citrusy
hops
should
shine
in
this
style
its
not
a
hoppy
porter
alaskan
kept
this
in
mind
when
brewing
this
ale
and
turned
out
a
sessionable
delicious
beer
not
overly
flavorful
but
a
nice
drinker
drinkability
was
ok
but
the
lack
of
outstanding
features
makes
me
wonder
why
youd
want
more
than
one
overall
a
below
average
example
of
what
i
generally
find
to
a
bastard
of
a
style
if
you
like
cascadia
dark
ales
youll
probably
be
ok
with
this
beer
even
if
the
lack
of
bold
hop
presence
makes
me
wonder
where
the
ipa
is
in
this
black
ipa
o
a
good
black
ipa
that
was
more
bitter
than
robust
for
the
style
recommended
though
somehow
im
second
to
strike
on
reviews
of
this
very
good
black
ipa
its
simple
and
creamy
and
satisfying
overall
a
nice
effort
and
a
well
made
beer
not
my
favorite
hop
flavor
compared
to
other
black
ipas
i
have
tried
overall
a
tasty
complex
beer
combining
some
great
features
of
a
dark
malty
beer
with
the
pungent
bite
of
hops
well
balanced
and
abv
well
hidden
amidst
the
flavors
has
a
reallllly
good
taste
for
whatever
it
is
nice
blend
here
good
mix
of
stout
and
black
ipa
very
drinkable
pours
an
extremely
dark
black
with
little
to
no
head
and
decent
lacing
looks
a
little
flat
aroma
is
malty
with
a
faint
smell
of
hops
taste
is
more
malt
than
hops
and
this
one
drinks
more
like
a
very
bitter
stout
than
a
dark
ipa
malt
y
notes
are
present
but
am
having
a
hard
time
with
the
bitterness
there
is
an
odd
fruitiness
to
the
taste
and
aroma
almost
like
rj
used
some
fruit
this
beer
has
a
dual
personality
it
doesnt
know
if
it
wants
to
be
an
imperial
stout
or
an
imperial
ipa
in
the
meantime
it
is
one
enjoyable
beer
flavor
is
a
way
more
hoppy
and
has
notably
more
earthyherbal
flavor
mediumhigh
bitterness
ibu
80
overall
my
expectations
were
low
but
this
one
was
quite
the
diamond
in
the
rough
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
ris
black
ale
lovers
picked
up
this
one
on
a
clearance
from
butlers
guess
i
should
have
known
that
it
was
a
dark
ipa
with
the
name
decent
looking
beer
with
not
a
lot
of
head
not
a
fan
at
all
had
a
lot
of
maltiness
but
then
way
to
much
bitter
that
seemed
out
of
balance
and
had
the
taste
of
an
ash
tray
on
the
end
the
roast
with
the
bitter
finish
just
did
not
work
a
little
bonus
overall
due
to
abv
i
was
disappointed
poured
from
a
wax
dipped
bomber
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
dark
browntoblack
coloring
with
a
thin
foamy
light
tan
head
aromas
of
chocolate
brown
sugar
subtle
resinous
notes
licorice
some
tropical
fruit
sweetness
and
some
pine
notes
the
chocolate
and
roast
characters
come
up
the
most
in
the
nose
flavors
are
heavily
roasted
and
yet
incredibly
smooth
chocolate
and
caramel
blend
on
the
forward
tongue
with
a
rich
creamy
backbone
some
bitter
and
piney
notes
in
the
background
and
a
roasted
almost
smoky
highlight
very
well
blended
and
balanced
the
body
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
roasted
rich
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
the
finish
has
a
bitter
linger
both
chocolate
and
hoppy
this
is
a
solid
heavy
very
tasty
brew
worth
searching
out
black
opaque
bod
with
an
inch
of
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
the
duration
aromas
include
roast
and
chocolate
first
followed
by
some
hop
and
pine
character
pretty
tasty
brew
here
i
wouldnt
have
guessed
it
was
nearly
10
abv
medium
bodied
and
well
balanced
moderate
bitterness
but
not
overpowering
a
nice
sipper
malty
roasty
hoppy
cant
ask
for
much
better
great
beer
one
of
the
finest
in
the
rj
rockers
collection
get
ready
for
a
ride
to
the
dark
side
of
ipa
brews
very
dark
appearance
great
smell
and
tastes
awesome
try
it
and
you
wont
soon
forget
the
black
perle
o
super
lush
and
flavorful
love
the
rich
chocolate
and
bitterness
orchestrated
into
a
well
balanced
brew
this
is
a
must
try
cheers
this
is
my
first
encounter
with
rj
rockers
and
it
was
definitely
a
good
one
this
offering
pours
a
very
deep
black
color
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
that
gives
way
to
a
handsome
light
brown
film
and
a
significant
amount
of
lacing
the
nose
on
this
one
is
light
and
unremarkable
but
carries
notes
of
chocolate
coffee
lots
of
roasted
malts
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
honestly
for
a
black
ipa
id
of
expected
more
hops
here
it
seems
closer
to
a
porter
than
a
black
ipa
the
flavor
is
rich
and
deep
lots
of
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
with
a
very
nice
roasted
malt
presence
and
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
ale
possibly
mislabeled
but
very
good
and
very
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
my
next
beer
from
this
brewer
ooverall
a
good
beer
seemed
more
like
a
stout
than
a

excellent
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
this
offering
id
call
it
a
hoppy
porter
rather
than
a
black
ipa
or
even
black
ale
very
nice
very
tasty
and
well
made
brew
if
black
ipas
are
your
thing
and
you
dont
want
it
to
be
just
a
psycho
hopped
ipa
that
happens
to
be
black
stop
and
frisk
this
beer
you
should
dig
it
good
stuff
overall
a
very
good
beer
but
a
bit
expensive
the
presentation
was
great
and
it
was
a
very
fun
beer
to
drink
all
the
way
through
i
have
nothing
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
only
pretty
good
things
a
surprisingly
subdued
beer
like
its
been
preaged
or
something
a
very
good
beer
but
not
really
a
black
ipa
i
dont
think
not
sure
where
the
ipa
name
comes
from
didnt
get
any
hop
taste
or
smell
the
quintessence
of
an
ipa
i
would
definitely
classify
this
as
an
imperial
stout
boozy
malty
and
smoky
still
a
great
brew
though
and
a
killer
bottle
love
the
wax
just
not
what
i
was
looking
for
on
a
warm
day
cheers
o
one
and
done
and
let
down
overall
an
extremely
roasty
burnt
and
bitter
beer
that
isnt
for
the
faint
at
heart
its
appearance
mirrors
its
flavours
o
im
torn
how
to
score
this
one
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
a
solidly
enjoyable
porter
but
it
doesnt
come
close
to
me
as
a
black
ipa
i
think
they
either
need
to
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
the
hop
profile
or
just
relabel
it
as
a
somewhathoppy
porter
i
think
ill
give
scores
for
the
beer
overall
id
estimate
2
75
for
style
as
listed
o
great
beer
thought
it
was
more
of
a
bitter
hopped
porter
than
a
black
ipa
but
would
get
again
quite
sippable
big
dark
brew
i
wish
i
could
remember
where
i
came
up
with
this
bottle
o
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
flavorful
black
ipa
that
is
also
remarkably
drinkable
considering
its
strength
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
overall
nicely
balanced
beer
in
both
malthop
mix
as
well
as
coffee
bitternes
and
chocolatecitrus
sweetness
very
good
d
not
bad
but
the
hop
character
is
a
bit
lacking
especially
in
the
aroma
still
the
malt
is
handled
rather
well
and
i
like
that
there
is
an
assertive
level
of
roast
character
but
it
is
not
heavy
enough
to
be
confused
with
a
stout
od
an
okay
beer
seems
to
have
a
tough
time
getting
an
identity
a
bit
filling
and
a
pretty
potent
alcohol
punch
makes
a
22oz
bomber
a
bit
hard
to
get
down
o
black
pearle
showed
some
real
potential
but
this
american
black
ale
from
rj
rockers
has
an
issue
its
very
faint
in
the
aroma
and
almost
undetectable
in
flavor
but
the
abundant
and
unnecessary
carbonation
is
a
telltale
sign
of
problems
i
should
know
with
all
the
homebrew
i
keep
botching
beyond
that
id
ask
for
more
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
to
combat
the
assertive
malt
profile
in
this
black
ale
but
its
definitely
drinkable
and
not
offensive
overall
impression
once
again
this
style
always
makes
my
head
hurt
wondering
what
i
should
be
looking
for
this
one
was
drinkable
with
malt
covering
up
most
of
the
hop
flavors
good
all
around
and
starting
to
enjoy
rj
rockers
and
their
beer
portfolio
o
pretty
good
beer
although
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
dark
and
roasty
malt
flavors
are
fantastic
but
it
lacks
the
hop
complexity
that
i
love
in
black
ipa
not
bad
for
the
price
but
there
are
better
options
out
there

with
hardly
any

noticed
after
the

very
smooth
to

overall
this
is
a
nice
black
ipa
that
is
quite
robust
with
roasted
flavors
other
than
the
obvious
fermentation
flaws
in
aromas
with
this
particular
bottle
it
was
still
quite
enjoyable
i
will
have
to
revisit
this
again
and
hope
i
get
a
better
bottle
this
strikes
me
more
like
a
big
porter
than
a
black
ipa
it
was
fine
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
say
it
is
deserving
of
a
wax
coating
the
impression
i
got
is
there
are
a
ton
of
ingredients
involved
but
they
sort
of
all
wash
out
distinct
flavors
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
overall
this
beer
doesnt
really
fall
into
an
established
category
it
is
technically
an
ale
which
is
black
which
is
made
in
america
but
thats
about
as
much
as
you
can
say
for
putting
it
in
this
style
category
still
it
is
a
yummy
beer
id
be
glad
to
quaff
again
drink
a
welcome
extra
with
some
good
layers
of
flavor
and
big
boozy
background
dont
think
i
would
have
again
but
still
good
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
pretty
bland
with
some
roasty
malt
and
herbal
hop
aromas
taste
is
the
same
but
seems
quite
watery
tasting
there
is
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
with
noting
that
really
stands
out
in
my
opinion
overall
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
this
brewery
would
definitely
pick
it
up
on
my
next
trip
to
sc
o
easy
to
drink
flavors
meld
together
more
porter
or
stout
than
a
black
ipa
though
on
its
on
not
judging
by
its
category
its
a
great
beer
o
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
itza
nice
although
we
were
all
perplexed
by
the
style
indicated
on
the
bottle
we
fully
enjoyed
this
beer
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
solid
beer
i
was
hoping
for
a
bigger
showing
of
hops
to
fit
the
black
ipa
mold
but
got
a
much
bigger
showing
of
imperial
stout
type
characteristics
that
said
i
think
ill
try
this
beer
again
if
i
see
it
as
this
newly
developing
black
ipa
style
really
intrigues
me
i
like
the
flavors
in
this
beer
it
has
really
nice
chocolate
notes
to
go
along
with
a
medium
roast
there
really
isnt
much
of
a
hop
presence
so
it
takes
some
style
point
hits
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
pours
a
near
opaque
black
with
lots
of
suspended
hop
particles
very
good
head
and
lacing
aroma
of
roasted
bready
malts
alcohol
and
carrots
hops
and
roasted
malt
give
a
nicely
balanced
taste
as
neither
dominates
nice
smooth
and
creamy
mouthfeel
but
dry
finish
this
is
a
tasty
and
mellow
version
of
an
american
black
ale
alcohol
is
well
hidden
for
9
5
o
overall
this
was
a
very
good
beer
drinkable
despite
being
9
5
flavors
not
too
overwhelming
a
balanced
and
tasty
drink
would
recommend
to
others
and
will
likely
buy
it
again
o
another
good
black
ale
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
darker
malts
nothing
is
overdone
nothing
is
missing
good
drinkability
id
call
this
a
ba
porter
but
only
a
b
ipa
so
ill
split
the
difference
and
give
overall
a
b
solid
example
of
this
new
style
i
recommend
o
i
dont
know
imo
this
is
giving
stones
release
a
run
for
its
money
would
like
to
try
side
by
side
this
might
be
a
tad
better
blended
would
like
to
know
a
bottled
on
date
to
know
if
this
had
sat
a
bit
definitely
one
you
should
want
to
try
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
pours
a
dark
brow
with
some
deep
burgundy
highlights
not
black
listed
as
a
dark
ipa
so
im
not
docking
any
marks
a
few
fingers
of
a
brown
tinged
khaki
head
great
retention
and
lacing
nose
is
less
impressive
some
muddled
and
certainly
not
outstanding
hopping
sweet
dark
fruits
burnt
brown
sugar
not
alot
of
ipa
character
to
be
found
taste
starts
with
the
dark
fruits
again
and
finishes
roasty
with
some
faint
coffee
flavour
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
and
roasty
for
my
liking
with
a
bitterness
thats
just
as
undesirable
medium
carbonation
moderately
interesting
overall
but
im
not
picking
up
any
real
ipa
qualities
per
say
leans
towards
more
of
a
moderately
hopped
english
porter
than
anything
meh
overall
a
good
quaff
very
drinkable
for
9
5
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
by
the
heavy
malts
i
would
buy
this
again
and
recommend
it
to
others
if
nothing
else
for
the
cool
bottle
but
it
happens
to
taste
good
too
muted
tastes
pretty
damned
good
but
is
this
really
a
cda
i
say
no
but
its
a
heckuva
imperial
stout
thick
creamy
and
loaded
with
chocolate
roast
and
hoppy
goodness
booze
is
alarmingly
wellhidden
sticky
coating
mouthfeel
is
equal
parts
sticky
chocolate
and
burnt
malts
in
the
interest
of
rating
to
style
i
have
to
dock
some
points
here
too
thicksweetchocolatey
for
the
cda
style
but
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
style
be
damned
picture
a
thicker
more
chocolatey
smuttynose
imperial
stout
im
tempted
to
cellar
a
few
bottles
of
this
to
enjoy
down
the
road
o
after
having
the
abita
black
ipa
at
the
event
i
think
this
one
fell
a
little
short
to
that
one
its
not
bad
by
any
means
the
people
serving
didnt
really
know
all
that
much
about
it
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
but
its
just
not
memorable
this
beer
pours
a
dark
chocolate
color
with
a
finger
of
tan
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
as
you
drink
the
aroma
is
strong
with
chocolate
roasted
malt
the
taste
starts
with
chocolate
malt
and
then
moves
to
some
slight
bitterness
but
there
is
no
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
which
is
what
i
would
have
expected
from
how
the
beer
was
described
on
the
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
with
slight
overcarbonation
overall
i
would
give
this
a
try
if
you
are
more
of
a
porter
fan
bottle
pours
dark
brown
with
a
moderate

im
not
really
an
ipa
guy
but
this
doesnt
really
taste
like
an
ipa
its
almost
like
a
hoppy
imperial
stout
distinct
roasted
malts
maybe
some
chocolate
or
cocoa
hops
are
robust
but
not
overwhelming
and
are
tempered
by
the
malts
enjoyed
it
a
lot
ill
buy
it
again
d
not
too
heavy
but
with
the
alcohol
level
it
would
not
be
a
session
beer
drinkability
is
solid
the
bomber
will
be
a
breeze
this
goes
down
easy
no
problem
drinking
this
one
the
best
from
rjs
ive
had
yet
in
all
this
was
a
great
introduction
to
sc
beers
i
hope
to
try
more
drinkability
slower
sipping
big
ipa
loads
of
flavor
but
one
glass
on
draft
was
just
not
enough
for
me

clear

sticks

offwhite
almost

an
almost

aroma
seems
to
be
dominated
by
phenol
alcohol
definitely
some
hops
in
the
glass
but
its
overwhelmed
by
the
alcohol
and
maybe
a
touch
of
roasted
malt
taste
is
certainly
bitter
as
expected
with
a
bit
of
expected
heat
following
the
aroma
almost
difficult
to
define
the
type
or
style
of
the
hops
used
in
the
taste
or
aroma
dare
i
say
that
this
beer
could
benefit
from
some
age
overall
gets
much
better
upon
warming
but
a
bit
too
hot
taste
speaks
to
me
more
in
the
language
of
a
hoppy
stout
than
a
dark
ipa
but
even
the
definition
of
that
is
debatable
right
now
certainly
not
cascadian
as
the
hops
on
this
are
more
earthy
and
blunted
than
its
pacnw
brethren
i
like
the
light
sweetness
and
the
heavy
roast
so
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
for
my
palate
and
does
not
disappoint
in
the
least
reminds
me
of
a
much
smoother
less
robust

really
hides
it
well
the
ipa
comes
out
more
as
it
warms
more
in
the
form
of
bitterness
than
flavoring
though
very
enjoyable
beer
and
i
liked
it
much
better
than

only
other
rjrbc
beer
i
have
tried
poured
out
an
opaque
jetblack
color
with
a
onefinger
tan
head
of
foam
it
was
shortlived
and
left
minimal
lacing
it
smelled
of
chocolate
cocoa
and
toffee
a
slight
floral
aroma
would
have
thought
of
a
more
hoppy
smell
should
have
come
from
a
iba
it
had
mild
bitterness
it
was
smooth
a
medium
to
heavy
bodied
ale
with
a
dry
finish
this
is
a
good
iba
but
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
m
medium
bodied
i
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
one
especially
the
mouthfeel
it
felt
too
thin
d
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
whole

dark

american
dark

thing
but
this
is
pretty
good
with
a
subtle
strength
that
nudges
toward

you
must
respect
this
despite
its
sneaky
subtleties
worth
a
try
nah
strongly
recommended
thank
ian
for
introducing
me
to
a
pretty
damn
good
cdabipaadawhatever
id
have
it
again
just
missing
that
all
important
ingredient
hops
d
easy
drinking
and
pretty
good
i
think
the
brewer
misclassified
this
one
id
say
it
fits
firmly
in
porter
category
if
i
rated
this
as
a
black
ipa
it
would
be
rated
lower
but
im
only
going
to
ding
it
one
point
in
drinkability
not
the
best
aba
ive
had
id
like
to
put
some
age
on
it
just
to
see
what
happens
with
the
sourness
experiments
are
fun
d
i
liked
this
beer
but
have
no
idea
what
to
compare
it
to
i
guess
what
i
like
is
how
different
it
is
yet
it
well
balanced
but
theres
multiple
layers
of
taste
and
flavor
and
in
a
weird
way
they
all
work
together
oh
and
i
drinking
a
year
old
bottle
cool
brew
must
have
again
taste
starts
with
almost
acrid
dark
grain
flavor
which
tries
to
hand
the
baton
in
the
middle
to
the
piny
bitterness
but
the
burnt
character
never
leaves
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
but
it
and
drinkability
are
limited
by
the
overassertive
darkness
in
this
brew
new
style
debate
aside
this
is
an
amazing
beerheavy
on
malt
and
hops
with
a
whole

of
balance

the
taste

be

to

available

area
drinkability
i
am
rating
a
fresh
bottle
of
the
recently
released
bottling
looking
over
the
reviews
i
have
the
sense
that
the
current
bottling
has
dealt
with
the
carbonation
and
hopping
issues
associated
with
the
previous
versions
still
i
would
agree
with
those
who
maintain
that
this
is
more
of
a
hoppy
porter
than
a
black
ipa
in
any
event
i
really
like
this
beer
and
think
that
in
its
current
version
it
is
truly
an
unappreciated
gem
d
a
slightly
uneven
beer
but
drinkable
enough
d
good
for
bomber
but
not
multiples
id
have
to
go
with
the
notion
that
it
really
falls
more
along
the
lines
of
a
hoppy
porter
the
ipa
aspect
just
doesnt
come
to
fruition
particularly
because
the
malt
and
chocolate
come
through
more
than
the
hops
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
just
feel
its
mislabeled
its
very
drinkable
and
i
love
sipping
on
it
the
carbonation
is
perfect
and
id
love
more

not

the

can
see
sediment
though
the

but
it
seems
kind
of
normal
for
a

the
taste
is
actually
quite
an
improvement
theres
a
great
roasty
flavor
layered
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
those
two
flavors
create
a
pleasant
bitterness
but
eventually
started
to
fade
into

background
i
dont
know
if
that
makes
it
more
or

it
was
a
very
tasty
beer
and
i

they
brew
it

going

tasty

enjoyable
even
as

never
buy
again
no

it
was
marked
down
so
cheap
o
definitely
a

i
enjoyed
this
one
good
subtle
flavors
and
not
to
boozie
like
others

i
have

from
the

in

its
so
cloying
its
actually
boozy
there
are
also
detectable
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
leather
even
some
peat
which
goes
way
against
this
one
being
a
black
ipa
but
thats
splitting
hairs
this
is
a
bold
and
boozy

as
someone
who
truly
enjoys

this

a
nice
offering
from

this

a
dark

almost
black
hue
with
a
large
and
lasting
light
tan
head
the
aroma
is
malty
with
some
notes
of
coffee
and
chocolate
this
one
sips
light
and
smooth
for
an
ale
with
its
abv
the
flavor
is
almost
reminiscent
of
root
beer
with
a
sweet
roasty
maltiness
accented
by
notes
of
vanilla
coffee
and
creme
soda
this
is
by
no
means
a
bad
black
ipa
but
given
some
of
the
other
offerings
out
there
it
makes
one
wonder
why
you
would
try
this
witb
so
many
much
better
offerings
out
there
o
i
really
liked
this
cascadian
ipa
because
it
had
an
excellent
balance
between
the
malts
and
hops
in
closing
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
its
rather
different
and
fun
to
drink
but
the
flavors
are
very
disjointed
and
the
carbonation
is
way
too
high
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
comes
across
as
more
of
a
lighter
stouthigh
in
coffee
flavors
low
in
body
high
in
carbonationthan
anything
like
a
dipa
i
dont
worry
too
much
about
styles
but
when
drinking
this
one
its
obvious
that
they
were
going
for
something
that
didnt
quite
happen
still
a
tasty
beverage
that
just
falls
short
a
bit
tried
this
on

at
the
detroit
fall

festival
obviously
from
the
name
its
a
black
ipa
it
pours
a
surprisingly
clear
black
with
fizzy
head
there
are
notes
of
grapefruit
and
leather
the
darker
notes
give
this
an
interesting
twist
on
a
traditional

pretty
much
opaque
amazing
dark

very
piney
almost
like

tastes
piney
hoppy
with
some
dark
chocolate
but
also
a
touch
watery
towards
the
finish
which
is
piney
a
bit
boozy
and
pretty
bitter
a
little
to
prickly
in
the
mouthfeel
with
the
carbonation
maybe
a
little
bit
of
black
pepper
before
the
finish
overall
its
pretty
delicious
for
a
wellhopped
beer
that
is
almost
9
and
contains
a
good
amount
dark
malts
bcraft
black
is
surprisingly
approachable
to
just
about
anyone
sure
some
will
react
by
spitting
and
running
as
far
as
possible
from
this
considerably
bitter
comparatively
bold
offering
but
on
the
whole
its
an
ale
that
marries
dark
malt
and
bright
hoppy
flavours
in
a
mild
and
engaging
fashion

i
had
this
beer
at
a
beer
tasting
some
time
ago
and
decided
to
pick
up
a
single
for
a
detailed
review
as
the
roastiness
is
somewhat
subdued
this
beer
would
be
a
good
introduction
to
someone
new
to
black
ipas
before
they
try
something
with
more
intense
roastiness
like
stones
ssra
on
a
side
note
i
never
would
have
thought
that
coffee
and
lemon
complement
each
other
yet
both
flavors
can
be
found
here
and
the
combination
is
intriguing
o
excellent
black
ipa
im
really
satisfied
with
the
complexities
and
sweetness
again
i
love
how
this
beer
smells
even
though
i
had
it
on
tap
i
did
look
at
the
bottle
label
online
the
label
solidified
my
desire
to
drink
this
over
halloween
season
it
just
gives
you
that
warm
fall
feeling
while
maintaining
the
hoppiness
and
bitterness
of
an

well

it
distinguishes
itself
more
for
what
it
is
not
than
what
it
is
no
ipa
character
as
the
label
suggests
but
nice
black

character

taste

tasty
version
with

kick
better
executed
than

lacks
the

and
thick
this
beer
was
enjoyable
and
worth
having
again
oa
solid
black
ipa
good
flavor
and
body
o
i
dont
think
the
full
potential
of
this
brew
were
brought
out
the
hops
are
a
little
subdued
and
more
of
the
roasted
malt
takes
over
and
the
abv
accompanied
with
the
burn
lend
this
more
to
a
hopped
porter
overall
the
bcraft
black
is
a
well
done
strong
black
ale
solid
all
day
would
have
it
again
sometime
pretty
good
black
ale
a
dipa
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch
still
enjoyable
oits
really
an
okay
beer
its
even
okay
as
a
black
ale
i
could
see
this
being
mistaken
as
a
citrusy
porter
the
abv
isnt
apparent
at
all
i
think
most
black
ale
fans
might
not
like
this
a
bit
light
on
hops
possibly
as
easy
as
this
is
to
drink
i
dont
recommend
it
or
think
ill
get
it
again
in
any
situation
overall
i
really
liked
this
black
ipa
it
imparts
tones
of
russian
imperial
stouts
with
anise
and
molasses
and
hides
the
abv
well
o
excellent
black
ale
picked
this
up
in
a
mixnmatch
which
explains
the
bottling
date
being
so
old
im
going
to
certainly
pick
up
a
4pack
of
this
when
fresh
really
great
very
enjoyable
beer
way
beyond
expectation
based
on
other
arcadias
ive
had
easily
drinkable
with
alcohol
content
barely
noticable
i
remember
really
enjoying
this
stuff
during
my
birthdays
visit
to
a
trade
show
last
year
so
expectations
are
high
to
begin
with
this
time
full
disclosure
i
guess
this
stuff
pours
a
deep
dark
sienna
topped
by
a
finger
of
tancream
foam
the
nose
comprises
roasted
malts
light
blackened
pretzel
dry
pine
resin
and
a
touch
of
straight
booze
tossed
in
for
good
measure
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
softening
the
resin
getting
rid
of
the
booze
entirely
and
adding
a
faint
hint
of
hickory
smoke
nice
the
body
is
a
lightleaning
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
drying
finish
overall
a
very
nice
black
ipa
one
that
lived
up
to
my
pleasant
memories
in
every
way
save
the
smell
which
to
be
fair
was
probably
getting
pretty
weak
by
the
time
i
got
to
this
one
last
year
leaves
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
where
you
can
tell
there
is
a
potent
amount
of
alcohol
overall
great
beer
to
try
o
unique
and
worth
a
try
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
then
one
in
a
sitting
my
broinlaw
is
awesome
he
set
me
up
with
bcraft
black
from
arcadia
and
it
is
amazing
the
beer
poured
a
opaque
black
with
thin
ecru
head
that
is
lacing
the
smell
contains
a
piny
roast
that
could
be
more
bold
if
i
am
to
compare
to
ssra
from
stone
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
of
the
smell
it
starts
off
roasty
then
finishes
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
good
beer
the
8
5
will
cause
everyone
pause
and
may
be
a
one
and
done
o
overall
while
the
nose
could
of
used
a
bit
more
ummph
the
flavor
was
generally
good
and
easy
consuming
material
for
casual
affairs
o
a
solid
bipa
they
combine
the
dark
flavors
with
the
hops
in
a
balanced
way
that
keeps
the
astringency
from
being
too
much
but
while
still
keeping
this
a
pretty
sippable
beer
especially
considering
its
abv
definitely
worth
a
try
d
pretty
tasty
black
ipa
wouldnt
hate
for
a
little
more
body
or
lingering
sweetness
to
fill
up
the
body
otherwise
really
solid
overall
its
pretty
tasty
but
wont
be
one
of
my
favorites
from
arcadia
medium
body
nice
carbonation
sticky
and
a
bit
rough
on
the
tongue
this
is
a
pretty
solid
black
dipa
although
the
alcohol
and
strong
pine
hops
can
combine
to
become
somewhat
of
an
overwhelming
force
at
times
this
is
a
potent
hoppy
mainly
piney
black
ale
i
do
have
issues
with
the
term
double
india
pale
ale
on
the
label
as
it
should
just
say
what
it
is
a
hoppy
american
black
ale
but
as
for
the
beer
its
nice
if
you
like
piney
beers
that
have
a
boozy
character
with
some
black
licoricechocolate
traits
and
is
balanced
enough
not
to
be
just
pine
sap
give
this
one
a
shot
welldone
great
black
dipa
first
example
of
the
style
i
had
tried
glad
someone
thought
of
this
style
it
was
a
great
idea
and
well
executed
flavor
carries
a
slight
citrus
sweetnessmedium
bodied
with
a
fair
amount
of
roasted
malt
comprising
the
main
flavor
accent
moderately
bitter
with
a
drying
finish
that
is
somewhat
chalky
in
feel
a
textbook
iba
nothing
too
wild
but
its
drinkable
with
a
good
hop
character
to
it
taste
is
strange
big
body
good
carbonation
layered
in
a
strange
way
hits
ya
from
back
to
front
chocolate
burnt
malts
some
plastic
like
taste
with
some
citrus
hop
profile
drinkable
but
i
feel
like
it
wasnt
thought
out
enough
comes
at
you
in
weird
layers
with
flavors
that
dont
exactly
pair
up
perfectly
to
be
certain
this
was
strong
and
took
a
little
while
to
fully
savor
i
didnt
taste
the
booze
and
it
didnt
detract
from
the
dark
flavors
but
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
bottle
it
had
already
sneaked
up
on
me
and
caught
me
offguard
once
i
was
past
that
there
wasnt
much
not
to
like
here
and
this
was
a
good
example
of
what
a
black
ipa
should
be
with
more
and
more
beers
of
this
style
hitting
store
shelves
every
year
better
versions
can
be
easily
found
but
fans
of
arcadia
or
beers
that
are
strong
and
heavy
will
find
enough
to
like
here
overall
fairly
straightforward
not
overly
hoppy
black
ipa
o
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
with
an
interesting
flavor
but
once
again
arcadia
has
not
astounded
me
overall
i
usually
like
hoppier
black
ipas
but
this
is
quite
nice
there
is
a
strange
aftertaste
that
is
there
and
gone
in
an
instant
so
brief
i
cant
really
identify
it
so
i
wont
peg
it
back
for
it
a
well
balanced
cascadian
or
black
ipa
thats
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
would
highly
recommend
seems
more
like
an
english
barleywine
to
me
not
bad
just
not
hopcentric
enough
to
please
me
pours
a

and
great

smells
of
hop
oils
slight
floral
hops
pine
slight
roasted
malt
and
a
hint
of
sweet

fits
the
style
of
an
american
black
ale
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
slight
roasted

hint
of

hop

citrus
hops
and
hint

overall
good
appearance
aroma
feel
and
body
the
blend
and
complexity
are
a
little
lacking
o
this
is
a
darn
good
black
ipa
and
it
even
holds
a
candle
to
sublimely
self
righteous
it
has
an
excellent
hop
profile
and
a
really
unique
overall
flavor
to
it
a
great
offering
from
arcadia
goes
down
smoothly
which
belies
the
8
and
change
abv
a
very
good
brew
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
alcohol
is
a
bit
hot
but
the
hop
profile
is
complex
and
the
malt
flavors
support
the
hop
character
without
dominating
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
worth
a
try
o
this
seems
like
a
pretty
standard
black
ipa
i
enjoyed
my
glass
but
its
piny
hops
coupled
with
roasted
malt
black
licorice
and
alcohol
flavors
didnt
make
the
beer
stand
out
for
me
i
am
not
the
biggest
licorice
fan
but
have
grown
to
appreciate
it
in
other
beers
so
this
still
may
be
one
for
you
to
seek
out
despite
the
slightly
below
average
rating
in
taste
made
with
style
heavily
in
mind
i
think
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
overall
reviewing
seems
to
have
drawn
me
to
my
least
favorite
characteristics
of
it
whereas
i
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
after
the
review
finished
and
i
was
simply
drinking
it
for
the
enjoyment
that
beer
inherently
brings
overall
this
is
a
great
black
ale
smoky
dense
but
never
overwhelming
and
all
the
flavors
compliment
each
other
o
this
beer
has
full
yeasty
ester
flavors
with
the
hops
being
much
softer
it
is
a
nice
beer
but
not
much
of
a
session
beer
at
8
5
abv
12oz

poured
into
a
snifter
pours
black
with
a
thin

even
with
a
fairly
rigorous

are

odd
or
at

not
what
i
expected
dank

tropical
with

then
pine

mint
and
roasted

but
comes
together
nicely
collectively
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
resinous
finishes
bitter
but
rather
refreshing
alcohol
is
well
concealed
this
one
was
strange
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
i
wasnt
expecting
the
tropical
flavors
that
were
present
but
it
was
well
balanced
both
sweet
and
bitter
and
a
pleasant
surprise
i
need
to
grab
another
one
when
i
get
the
chance
the
body
is
medium
with
an
evenly
crisp
and
smooth
feel
to
it
carbonation
is
light
and
keeps
it
lively
without
overdoing
it
this
beer
pours
pitch

strong
anise

with
a
slight

burn
dry

intertwined

not
a
beer
im
looking
for
anytime
soon
its
full
of
dark

herbal

earth

its
too
wild
for
my
tastes
o
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
black
ipa
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
top
two
that
i
have
tried
in
this
style
i
will
probably
be
in
the
minority
since
the
hops
arent
overwhelming
i
prefer
this
style
to
be
more

8
5
amazing
stuff
o
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
arcadia
and
one
of
the
better
black
ales
ive
had
o
definitely
plays
more
like
a
dipa
than
a
regular
black
ipa
id
say
definitely
worth
a
pick
up
overall
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
this
was
a
great
example
of
an
american
black
ale
the
hop
profile
mixed
very
well
with
the
malt
base
which
made
for
a
very
complex
and
great
tasting
beer
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
very
smooth
and
hardly
had
any
bitterness
which
i
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
went
down
way
faster
and
if
i
had
another
one
i
would
for
sure
drink
it
the
alcohol
was
hidden
very
well
also
theres
no
doubt
that
a
couple
of
these
would
for
sure
hit
the
spot
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
pretty
much
everything
i
cant
think
of
anything
i
would
want
to
change
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
i
wish
it
was
just
a
little
cheaper
but
with
a
limited
release
i
cant
really
complain
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
in
fact
i
will
be
getting
more
in
day
or
two
and
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anyone
its
just
that
damn
good
arcadia
did
an
awesome
job
with
this
beer
i
have
found
that
they
can
be
hit
or
miss
sometimes
but
in
this
case
it
was
a
huge
hit
i
am
now
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
think
its
pretty
safe
to
say
that
this
is
now
my
favorite
american
black
ale
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
arcadia
north
peaks
furry
used
to
be
my
favorite
but
this
beer
is
better
in
almost
every
aspect
i
am
glad
they
bottled
this
beer
i
can
see
a
lot
more
of
this
beer
in
my
future
o
a
really
nice
brew
seems
pretty
unique
at
this
point
combining
the
newer
american
black
ale
and
imperial
ipa
styles
things
work
really
well
together
its
difficult
to
explain
its
something
of
a
hoppy
imperial
stout
but
not
really
glad
i
bought
it
at
around
2
50
for
a
single
its
not
an
everyday
beer
but
certainly
doesnt
break
the
bank
i
would
buy
it
again
overall
get
me
another
oh
wait
how
much
alcohol
is
in
this
not
terrible
but
i
was
hoping
for
better
i
would
buy
this
again
looking
for
a
unique
stron
ale
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
hoppy
stuff
wow
this
is
a
nice
double
black
ipa
this
is
a
great
beer
from
arcadia
theres
something
unique
about
it
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
well
crafted
i
feel
like
it
should
have
a
higher
score
from
me
highly
recommended
i
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
black
ipa
style
but
this
one
sets
the
new
highwater
mark
a
really
good
beer
and
one
i
plan
to
have
many
more
of
another
winner
from
arcadia

give

the

smell
of
mostly
roasted

some
peppery

very

tastes
of
roasted

and
very
little
else
a

me
with

any
just
weird

lack

nothing
to
really
enjoy
here
for
me
bland
and
no

an
unfortunate
miss
by

o
very
cool
to
get

here
in

thanks
sanford
very
nice
brew
draft
to
tulip
at
hop
cat
in
grand
rapids
mi
which
is
a
phenomenal
beer
bar
everything
about
this
beer
is
great
the
best
black
ipa
ive
ever
had
black
as
midnight
with
a
great
bouquet
of
hops
and
malts
the
taste
has
great
balance
and
by
balance
i
mean
the
hops
and
malt
are
equally
overthetop
and
complement
each
other
nicely
and
the
mouthfeel
is
great
too
surprisingly
refreshing
for
its
genre
id
drink
it
again
and
again
if
it
was
made
with
any
regularity

opaque
black

of

qualities
mellow
as
this
8

ipa
warms
and
is
still
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
night
i
must
admit
this
is
pretty
much
the
first
arcadia
i
have
really
liked
hopmouth
has
become
tiresome
at
this
point
even
though
i
know
it
still
sells
d
this
was
easy
enough
to
finish
id
try
this
one
again
if
i
could
find
it
in
a
bottle
one
of
the
better
arcadia
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
d
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
are
robust
but
dont
build
on
the
palate
very
enjoyable
d
one
is
enough
acquired
during
7am
happy
hour
at
logans
alley
this
brew
filled
a
pint
glass
with
a
magnificent
rich
brown
capped
by
a
tan
head
the
nose
was
ripe
with
hop
character
and
roasted
darkness
the
great
malt
character
of
this
beer
with
its
mild
roasted
tones
and
subdued
sweetness
mingled
well
with
the
hopping
to
produce
a
smooth
and
utterly
drinkable
brew
while
still
boasting
a
large
profile
it
is
a
crying
shame
that
arcadia
does
not
bottle
this
one
i
do
enjoy
many
of
the
offerings
from
arcadia
but
can
honestly
say
this
is
my
favorite
went
down
very
easily
and
could
see
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
while
many
may
not
have
the
opportunity
to
enjoy
this
one
jump
on
it
if
you
see
it
got
it
ontap
at
hopcat
in
grand
rapids
mi
dpretty
damn
good
d
this
was
good
flavored
black
ipa
i
thought
arcadia
seems
to
be
on
the
ball
and
coming
up
with
newer
more
flavorful
beers
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
beer
out
more
of
a
deep
brown
in
color
and
not
much
light
seeps
through
a
fingernail
of
khaki
colored
head
covers
the
top
brussels
lacing
enticing
aroma
of
freshpiney
hops
is
moderately
present
the
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
blend
of
piney
hops
and
caramelized
dark
malt
theres
a
prominent
pine
hop
edge
that
stays
with
you
in
the
fade
the
mouth
is
lightly
sticky
and
chewy
not
a
fan
of
this
style
to
begin
with
and
i
think
this
one
was
starting
to
lose
some
of
its
hop
bite
pours
with
a
huge
head
that
leaves
copious
lacing
on
the
glass
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
black
ipa
style
but
i
have
no
complaints
the
malts
provide
a
slightly
sweet
caramel
flavor
the
melds
well
with
the
citrusy
hops
the
bottle
says
the
hops
are
piney
and
citrusy
but
i
get
more
citrus
than
pine
it
was
very
good
def
will
buy
again
overall
solid
black
ipa
very
drinkable

a

love
the
bright

character
another
great
showing
from
a
brewery
that
really
impresses
me
overall
really
love
this
black
ipa
more
malty
than
most
with
less
hops
but
just
enough
for
an
ipa
overall
nice
easy
drinking
black
ipa
nothing
special
but
still
enjoyable
very
nice
hoppy
aroma
the
hops
are
more
subdued
in
the
flavor
letting
the
medium
roasted
malt
shine
a
bit
a
touch
of
rye
and
anise
spices
are
a
welcomed
component
and
meld
well
with
the
malts
again
the
aroma
is
where
this
beer
shines
this
drinks
like
a
session
black
ale
i
could
easily
knock
down
several
of
these
in
a
setting
a
hoppy
black
ale
that
combines
sweet
and
roasted
barley
and
chocolate
malt
with
a
rather
delicate
if
high
volume
citrusy
hopping
a
very
interesting
marriage
of
flavors
here
not
as
black
as
expected
dark
brown
glowing
amber
in
the
light
under
an
inch
of
off
white
fluff
that
settles
slowly
the
nose
here
is
citrus
hops
and
roasted
barley
with
all
of
its
attendant
bitterness
seems
brighter
than
it
looks
and
a
sturdy
ale
yeast
ties
the
two
together
the
flavor
starts
and
ends
with
the
dark
malt
not
brutally
dark
but
earthen
and
well
roasted
the
hops
are
only
in
the
middle
not
in
the
finish
which
i
find
odd
and
enjoyable
lemons
and
even
kiwi
fruit
are
coming
from
the
hops
a
very
cool
palate
before
the
wave
of
dark
barley
washes
them
clean
id
like
a
little
more
body
in
this
one
the
flavors
are
great
but
the
journey
from
a
to
b
is
too
short
carbonation
could
also
use
a
little
kick
up
overall
though
a
very
cool
beer
from
new
glarus
thanks
to
drlovemd87
for
bringing
this
one
back
for
me
overall
great
job
new

real
impressive
overall
a
great
buy
from
ng
if
youre
a
hophead
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
hoppy
and
dark
like
mentioned
above
the
flavors
are
complex
but
do
not
clash
the
flavors
weave
together
to
make
a
very
enjoyable
brew

pleasant

made

post
review
addition
just
learned
from
a
fellow
beer
aficionado
that
this
beer
is
in
fact
a
black
ipa
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
with
a
solid
mix
of
character
i
would
drink
this
again
overall
pretty
solid
and
tasty
black
ale
a
nice
hop
and
malt
blend
that
rolls
off
the
tongue

too
a
trip
to
wisconsin
is
seen
in
the
immediate
future
to
get
more
oa
good
black
ipa
not
sure
of
the
freshness
though
overall
a
solid
black
ipa
there
are
some
better
ones
out
there
but
for
the
price
this
one
is
solid
d
aside
from
far
higher
carbonation
than
i
prefer
this
is
really
good
recommended
o
really
tasty
and
easydrinking

very
light

is

for
this
abas
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
fruit
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
more
like
a
regular
ipa
than
the
style
they
were
going
for
in
my
opinion
this
has
a
real
pleasing
flavor
with
the
grapefruit
hop
profile
coming
across
each
sip
theres
a
dry
finish
with
a
touch
of
cocoa
nib
on
it
i
liked
it
o
this
has
a
nice
n
w
coast
hop
profile
with
good
black
malt
notes
without
the
bitterness
this
is
a
nice
session
beer
with
lots
of
character
overall
a
real
winner
here
i
have
tried
it
several
times
now
some
days
i
think
it
is
amazing
some
just
good
to
great
either
way
always
a
good
choice
still
amazingly
flavorful
while
remaining
eminently
refreshing
o
a
nice
black
ipa
with
great
balance
and
drinkability
black
ipas
are
usually
hit
or
miss
with
me
and
this
one
is
a
hit
recommended
this
is
clearly
a
brew
meant
for
knocking
back
a
couple
pints
the
beer
is
quite
tasty
though
i
think
i
prefer
the
juiciness
of
the
aroma
a
bit
more
than
the
flavor
heresy
perhaps
but
the
body
malt
is
almost
a
bit
too
light
to
fully
be
able
to
support
the
hop
character
in
the
flavor
department
o
very
very
good
it
isnt
over
the
top
which
im
learning
that
new
glarus
is
very
good
at
that
its
a
lot
more
mild
than
the
big
black
ales
ive
had
before
but
it
still
holds
the
same
qualities
of
a
great
one
its
a
very
good
black
ipa
dont
think
ive
had
a
better
one
in
a
while
if
ever
as
a
guy
who
loves
black
butte
portereddy
fitz
porteretc
i
would
like
a
bit
more
of
that
roasty
malt
presence
in
a
black
ipa
that
is
what
would
really
do
it
for
me
anyway
if
you
like
both
ipas
and
porters
this
is
an
interesting
one
for
you
to
try
cheers
o
decent
black
ipa
it
is
much
like
the
rest
of
the
new
glarus
offerings
in
that
i
was
expecting
much
more
out
of
the
beer
than
it
actually
provided
another
beer
from
ng
that
i
feel
doesnt
live
up
to
all
the
hype
i
just
wish
that
the
minds
at
work
in
new
glarus
wisconsin
would
be
a
little
bit
more
bold
when
it
comes
to
their
brews
however
i
may
be
tainted
by
trying
to
compare
it
to
stones
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
i
think
aside
from
wookey
jack
this
is
one
of
my
top
black
ipa
picks
too
bad
its
not
available
here
o
its
not
really
a
black
ale
but
its
still
pretty
good
but
theres
better
black
ipas
out
there
overall
wanted
more
from
the
hops
personally
still
a
very
good
beer
ours
with
a
small
head
of
off
white
foam
on
a
very
dark
brown
body
a
nicely
spicy
hop
aroma
with
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
thick
malt
up
front
with
a
nicely
balanced
hop
character
notes
of
orange
and
grapefruit
and
light
roast
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
this
has
a
great
hop
flavor
and
just
enough
dark
malt
character
to
make
it
more
than
an
issue
of
appearance
o
its
a
nice
balance
when
i
want
the
hops
from
an
ipa
and
the
malt
of
a
stout
and
drinks
much
easier
without
the
bitterness
that
some
nights
turn
me
off
from
an
ipa
o
this
was
a
slightly
above
average
black
ipa
it
was
good
and
had
a
nice
aromataste
profile
but
there
wasnt
anything
about
it
that
made
it
stand
out
too
much
definitely
something
that
i
would
drink
again
but
nothing
that
i
would
necessarily
seek
out
owell
balanced
and
very
good
beer
not
quite
as
complex
as
i
would
have
expected
but
still
a
great
brew
a
really
good
black
ipa
the
smell
mixes
hops
and
malts
quite
well
and
the
feel
is
excellent
taste
is
the
low
point
but
its
still
pretty
good
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
fairly
low
intensity
resulting
in
a
smooth
though
somewhat
overly
placid
mouthfeel
closes
semidry
with
significant
stickiness
lingering
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
great
black
ipa
its
got
alot
going
on
that
gives
it
great
complexity
and
balance
this
is
the
black
ipa
for
someone
who
wants
to
get
into
more
beers
of
this
style
very
hop
forward
with
a
citrus
nose
and
citrus
taste
with
light
pine
there
is
very
light
roast
to
get
the
dark
black
hue
with
slight
off
white
head
i
prefer
a
bit
more
roast
when
i
settle
into
a
black
ipa
but
this
beer
drinks
so
smooth
regardless
of
style
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
worth
seeking
out
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
o
i
really
liked
this
beer
everything
went
together
very
well
and
was
surprised
that
i
like
it
so
much
will
definitely
be
added
to
my
new
glarus
hauls
a
very
nice
black
ale
and
a
bit
potent
cheers
new
glarus
overall
its
a
perfect
blend
of
a
dark
ale
and
an
ipa
i
have
to
say
this
beer
pulled
it
off
combining
two
opposing
flavors
the
roasted
malts
from
dark
ale
and
bitter
hops
from
the
ipa
i
do
not
recall
last
time
i
had
a
black
ipa
so
this
will
be
my
baseline
comparison
its
one
of
those
beers
where
i
could
have
2
or
3
in
a
single
day
pretty
sessionable
black
top
black
ipa
from
new
glarus
pours
a
deep
dark
brown
that
boarders
on
being
black
a
thin
light
tan
head
settles
atop
the
brew
while
providing
a
solid
amount
of
lacing
a
rich
bouquet
of
hop
aromas
entice
the
drinker
to
get
a
deeper
whiff
aromas
include
tropical
fruits
pine
resin
grapefruit
and
orange
zest
play
out
over
subtle
hints
of
roasted
malt
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
on
the
palate
the
brew
melds
together
a
perfect
balance
of
floral
citrus
and
hop
flavors
over
a
wonderful
caramel
and
chocolatey
dark
malt
base
superbly
balanced
black
top
is
well
carbonated
and
features
a
silky
medium
body
please
ship
to
colorado
o
definitely
an
interesting
beer
it
seems
to
bridge
the
gap
between
ipa
and
black
ale
quite
well
goes
down
very
easy
and
wont
knock
you
down
a
very
solid
black
ipa
recommended
thanks

this

is
rather

i

barry
huge
hop
flavor
tons
of
citrus
and
resin
carbonation
could
be
dialed
down
a
notch
malt
presence
is
fairly
subtle
yeah
if
that
carbonation
was
right
this
would
be
stellar
overall
a
very
solid
black
ale
hops
stand
out
at
first
but
the
dark
roasted
malts
are
very
solid
overall
the
black
ipa
is
a
difficult
beast
to
master
but
this
beer
is
very
well
done
nails
the
balance
between
hops
and
malt
and
while
im
not
sure
ill
ever
have
a
black
ipa
that
really
wows
me
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
in
my
opinion
o
pretty
drinkable
probably
on
the
less
hoppy
side
compared
to
most
other
black

fairly

love
a
beer
like
this
that
finds
that
perfect
maltybitter
and

balance
on

flavors
would
seem
to
clash
but
this
one
is
extremely
drinkable
and
delicious
yearround
fresh
black
top
makes
me
happy
b
o
overall
a
really
nice
black

loads
of

roasted
malts
which
work
really
well
together
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
style
id
definitely
recommend
checking
it
out
would
like
to
have
it
again
o
quite
nice
not
as
hoppy
as
i
like
my
cdas
but
thankfully
the
roast
has
not
subbed
in
for
the
hops
like
a
bitter
is
to
an
ipa
just
a
nice
hoppy
easy
drinking
beer
id
love
another
and
would
buy
again
this
poured
out
as
a
very
deep
brown
color
a
decent
looking
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
retention
settles
leaving
a
thin
film
over
top
of
the
beer
and
a
scattered
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
aromatic
its
got
a
nice
piney
hop
aroma
blended
with
the
roasted
earthy
malts
and
chocolate
in
there
too
the
taste
is
really
balanced
its
got
a
hoppy
flavor
upfront
with
a
chocolatey
roasted
aftertaste
its
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
some
of
the
black
ipas
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
its
rich
and
slightly
creamy
the
carbonation
is
really
nice
also
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
high
drinkability
with
a
lot
of
flavor
enjoyable
for
sure
o
overall
this
was
an
interesting
black
ipa
i
would
like
abit
more
ipa
aspects
though
in
this
beer
the
notes
that
are
there
though
are
quite
tasty
this
beer
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
few
centimeters
of
tan
foam
that
quickly
receded
the
aroma
is
pure
hops
with
pine
and
citrus
pummeling
the
senses
this
continues
on
the
palate
the
dark
malt
does
try
to
break
through
with
some
smooth
dark
burnt
flavors
but
it
never
quite
makes
it
to
the
stage
the
piny
hop
resin
and
citrus
and
floral
hops
plow
through
front
to
back
a
nice
tasting
brew
with
a
heavy
hops
presence
d
very
good
stout
says
on
the
label
even
though
it
is
considered
to
be
an
american
black
ale
dark
roasted
flavors
come
on
strong
at
the
beginning
and
disappear
pretty
quickly
leaving
behind
a
pleasant
reminder
of
the
good
beer
you
just
had
overall
wish
i
had
some
more
of
this
stuff
o
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
had
all
the
flavors
blend
well
and
it
is
quite
a
treat
if
you
have
never
had
a
black
ipa
it
is
hard
to
find
one
better
than
new
glarus
overall
a
good
not
great
black
ipa
i
do
like
the
piney
hops
i
would
not
turn
this
one
down
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
i
would
go
to
first
the
beer
feels
odd
in
the
mouth
not
crisp
not
creamy
not
slick
lots
of
carbonation
that
leads
to
more
of
a
stomachfeel
than
mouthfeel
doesnt
work
for
me
overall
a
nice
dark
ipa
from
new
glarus
the
malt
provides
color
but
not
too
much
flavor
my
brother
would
tell
you
otherwise
but
lets
just
say
he
got
to
finish
the
six
pack
another
excellent
brew
from
new
glarus
a
very
balanced
hoppy
black
ale
in
a
style
where
subtlety
and
balance
are
not
often
appreciated
o
a
very
good
beer
personally
id
prefer
just
the
slightest
bit
more
dark
malt
presence
and
a
hint
more
hop
flavor
this
amazed
me
less
as
i
went
through
it
but
its
a
fine
drink
and
enjoyable
drink
overall
4
0
d
solid
all
around
this
is
not
something
i
usually
say
about
a
black
ipa
o
overall
a
decent
black
ale
plenty
of
hops
and
roasted
malts
but
falls
on
its
face
towards
the
end
of
the
taste
way
to
watery
which
almost
drowns
out
the
flavors
for
me
overall
this
is
probably
my
new
favorite
new
glarus
and
black
ipa
in
general
well
new
glarus
continues
to
make
solid
if
sometimes
unspectacular
beers
i
love
having
them
accessible
affordable
and
never
a
bad
bottle
or
qc
issue
having
said
that
this
batch
isnt
quite
as
vibrant
as
last
years
o
very
solid
black
ipa
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
and
probably
the
easiest
drinking
one
that
ive
had
definitely
worth
trying
pours
a
dark
cola
brown
with
good
light
khaki
head
some
sticky
lacing
scent
brings
balance
of
piney
and
citrus
hops
with
a
sweet
and
lightly
toasted
malt
backbone
piney
hops
at
the
front
with
some
citrus
notes
malts
have
an
odd
combo
of
lightly
sweet
and
burnt
almost
molasses
like
strangely
bubbly
and
lighter
in
body
a
little
too
light
on
the
hops
and
interesting
on
the
malts
for
me
to
love
not
a
remarkable
beer
not
bad
by
any
means
but
not
something
ill
long
for
great
example
though
just
not
my
favorite
style
pours
a
dark
brownblack
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
dissolves
into
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
very
appetizing
yet
subtle
scents
of
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
with
a
touch
of
pine
taking
a
sip
releases
a
sharp
blast
of
dark
roasty
malts
paired
with
orange
and
grapefruit
melding
together
perfectly
excellent
i
think
the
carbonation
level
of
this
beer
is
perfect
as
well
as
the
viscosity
which
is
mediumbodied
and
perfectly
fitting
for
the
style
take
care
not
to
drink
this
one
too
quickly
another
home
run
for
new
glarus
will
definitely
buy
more
than
a
single
next
time
i
see
this
new
glarus
delivers
once
again
with
black
top
o
i
approve
of
the
black
ipa
trend
surprisingly
drinkable
for
how
bitter
it
is
does
not
destroy
the
palate
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
of
the
sweet
scent
to
translate
into
my
tastebuds
as
this
guy
is
a
little
too
charred
for
my
liking
but
i
would
gladly
buy
another
6
of
this
guy
o
decent
black
ale
easy
to
drink
at
first
but
a
bit
cloying
and
overwhelming
with
the
sweetness
of
that
particular
hop
profile
overall
i
havent
had
many
different
beers
of
this
style
i
can
only
imagine
that
many
tilt
well
to
one
side
or
other
of
the
malthops
balance
this
one
steers
a
very
successful
middle
course
flavorful
and
very
nearly
quaffable
another
home
run
from
new
glarus
this
is
really
great
o
really
nice
mild
flavors
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
another
winner
stout
from
ng
black
top
pours
a
light
bodied
dark
hazelnut
brown
that
turns
to
a
black
as
it
pools
it
has
a
nice
and
soft
one
finger
beige
colored
head
and
the
beer
has
amber
highlights
in
the
light
the
nose
is
clean
and
hoppy
its
slightly
floral
and
grassy
with
no
roasted
notes
i
didnt
expect
that
but
welcome
the
change
of
pace
the
flavors
are
clean
and
soapy
its
slightly
floral
and
grassy
and
has
a
little
malt
sweetness
to
it
and
very
light
roast
it
has
nice
flavor
it
drinks
light
and
dry
im
a
fan
if
i
had
been
blindfolded
i
would
have
thought
that
this
was
a
standard
ipa
and
i
love
that
i
wish
more
breweries
were
able
to
capture
that
aspect
drinkability
another
excellent
creation
from
new
glarus
however
and
i
hate
to
say
this
i
think
i
prefer
summits
black
ale
overall
its
a
flavorful
yet
unique
style
of
ipa
that
deserves
to
be
tried
out
at
the
very
least
its
not
perfect
but
its
worth
checking
out
even
being
in
wisconsin
ive
had
a
hard
time
finding
this
beer
im
going
to
drink
it
as
long
as
its
available
this
beer
is
brilliant
world
class
cost
9
99
for
a
six
pack
when
i
received
it
in
a
trade
with
willseph
it
was
moderately
fresh
i
guess
im
to
blame
for
not
cracking
it
open
sooner
its
very
good
as
is
so
i
bet
its
even
better
when
its
not
8
months
old
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
with
a
nice
pine
hop
finish
and
a
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
the
grain
a
decent
drinking
beer
one
of
the
better
simpler
black
ales
ive
had
i
would
have
it
again
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
nice
twofinger
offwhite
head
good
retention
and
some
sticky
lacing
as
it
falls
the
nose
has
some
nice
pine
and
roast
plus
backing
citrus
flavor
meshes
the
hops
and
the
backing
roasted
malt
quite
well
this
is
how
an
aba
should
be
done
body
is
medium
with
a
touch
of
acrid
roast
dryness
plus
hop
bitterness
cutting
through
quite
good
overall
this
beer
is
fantastic
its
a
fruity
chocloaty
masterpiece
highly
recommend
picking
this
up
again
the
beer
is
chestnut
brown
with
a
quarter
inch
of
beige
head
nice
aroma
with
scents
of
pine
hop
resin
roast
the
roast
character
is
definitely
secondary
to
the
pine
and
hop
flavors
easy
to
drink
with
a
lingering
taste
of
pine
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
overall
this
was
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
yet
had
a
delicious
black
ipa
overall
a
mildly
hoppy
black
ipa
that
was
very
easy
going
down
and
had
an
enjoyable
aftertaste
andy
i
hope
you
enjoy
this
review
because
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
thanks
again
while
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
aba
style
i
find
black
top
to
be
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
beers
that
new
glarus
has
put
out
it
has
fine
balance
and
complexity
and
its
a
beer
that
can
be
returned
to
again
and
again
i
recommend
this
while
ice
fishing
definitely
worth
trying
for
yourself
osolid
beer
to
the
style
good
all
around

another
big
thanks
from
2bdchicago
for
the
never
ending
secret
santa
haul
12oz
bottle
served
in
my
sa
perfect
pint
at
53
degrees
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
cola
with
a
loose
half
inch
fizzy
khakicolored
head
that
sizzles
and
pops
as
it
dissipates
into
a
consistent
quarter
inch
froth
swaths
and
spatters
of
lacing
coat
the
walls
of
the
class
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
earthypiny
hops
in
the
foreground
and
a
suggestion
of
chocolate
malt
in
the
background
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
a
slightly
metallic
quality
in
the
middle
and
the
malt
profile
is
very
much
subdued
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
with
a
prickly
carbonation
that
leaves
a
residual
burn
at
the
back
of
the
throat
theres
also
a
little
bit
of
acidity
that
lightly
stimulates
the
sides
of
the
cheeks
overall
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
however
i
prefer
something
a
bit
more
malt
forward
well
worth
your
time
if
the
opportunity
presents
and
you
tastes
lean
towards
the
hoppier
end
of
the
spectrum
o
the
bottle
lists
this
as
a
black
ipa
so
that
is
what
ill
rate
it
as
sure
this
one
is
packed
full
of
charred
malts
and
citrus
hops
but
there
is
no
balance
between
the
two
actually
there
is
disharmony
and
while
this
beer
isnt
a
bad
beer
im
just
not
feeling
the
love
from
it
either
m
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
pours
extremely
dark
amber
the
red
coloring
only
shows
when
held
up
to
light
not
much
of
a
head
here
holy
shit
great
scent
piney
hops
right
in
your
face
but
not
enough
to
think
youre
going
to
drink
pinesol
mouth
watering
the
hops
are
definitely
up
front
on
this
one
it
finishes
up
sweet
and
i
wonder
if
thats
the
molasses
they
said
was
in
it
on
the
bottle
another
great
effort
from
new
glarus
cheers
o
i
am
pretty
critical
of
these
new
abas
and
prefer
an
opaque
black
color
huge
hoppy
nose
and
as
little
dark
malts
as
possible
this
beer
is
not
that
dark
not
that
hoppy
and
a
little
on
the
malty
side
but
these
standards
are
nearly
unreachable
i
prefer
lakefront
brewing
companys
iba
to
this
but
this
is
an
excellent
interpretation
of
a
new
style
that
my
guidelines
might
be
construed
against
still
another
great
beer
from
wisconsin
new
glarus
is
great
d
this
is
the
sort
of
black
ipa
that
i
like
most
low
bitterness
big
hop
aroma
and
only
light
chocolate
and
black
malt
notes
crushable
stuff
and
with
a
great
price
to
boot
slightly
tannic
roasted
coffee
bitterness
up
front
metallic
twang
as
well
caramel
and
fruit
sweetness
bloom
in
the
foreground
as
roasted
malt
and
hop
bitterness
builds
in
the
background
hop
flavors
of
pine
and
citrus
mix
nicely
with
the
milk
chocolate
molasses
and
dark
fruit
sweetness
lingering
citrus
notes
in
the
otherwise
caramelfruit
finish
medium
body
with
a
nice
creamy
feel
dont
know
how
fresh
this
is
but
i
can
believe
that
the
hops
have
faded
a
little
still
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
o
quite
drinkable
balanced
with
some
complexity
an
interesting
style
another
good
release
from
a
leading
wisconsin
brewery
o
a
good
black
ipa
mine
was
2
months
old
so
some
of
the
hops
may
have
faded
a
solid
tasty
brew
would
like
a
fresher
one
creamy
malty
and
citrus
inspired
brew
the
black
top
from
new
glarus
has
it
positives
and
a
few
negatives
the
beer
pours
just
about
opaque
slight
light
still
coming
through
the
head
was
thin
slightly
offwhite
and
is
leaving
a
lacing
the
smell
includes
pine
citrus
and
chocolate
the
taste
provides
hints
of
pine
and
slight
bitter
citrus
there
are
some
tones
of
chocolate
but
not
overly
present
the
mouthfeel
is
a
good
medium
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
besides
being
a
great
beer
other
notable
positives
is
that
the
abv
is
lower
making
this
a
decent
session
beer
one
draw
back
is
that
when
comparing
against
stone
self
righteous
or
two
brothers
black
hop
juice
just
do
not
have
the
big
double
ipa
flavors
mixed
with
big
roasty
finish
i
need
to
drink
this
back
to
back
with
odells
and
grand
tetons
black
ales
these
three
beers
make
up
the
exemplary
models
for
style
to
this
guys
palate
overall
good
stuff
o
solid
brew
easy
to
drink
very
finetuned
flavors
rather
than
big
inyourface
flavors
like
a
lot
of
beers
verdict
a
really
nice
black
ipa
from
one
of
the
finest
breweries
in
america
new
glarus
never
lets
me
down
and
this
is
no
exception
great
hoppy
flavors
great
malty
flavors
a
job
well
done
very
disappointed
by
this
one
as
ive
loved
almost
everything
ive
had
from
ng
before
it
just
kind
of
tastes
liked
a
watered
down
porter
my
first
ever
new
glarus
beer
had
a
friend
grab
some
when
he
went
home
for
thanksgiving
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
quickly
dispersing
head
the
smell
is
mildly
hoppy
with
some
nutiness
has
a
good
mouthfeel
not
to
thick
or
thin
taste
was
bitter
then
citrus
then
hops
and
finished
with
a
dark
woodnut
tone
i
havent
had
many
dark
ipas
but
this
is
one
that
i
will
for
sure
seek
out
again
food
pairings
would
be
fun
with
this
beer
picked
this
sixer
up
in
platteville
wi
at
the
piggly
wiggly
smell
of
citrus
hops
maybe
some
pine
and
roasted
malts
brownish
black
pour
with
white
head
a
little
sweetness
to
it
and
then
the
hops
come
in
wow
is
this
a
great
beer
toasted
malts
and
hops
mix
well
new
glarus
really
hit
a
home
run
with
this
brew
o
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
i
feel
like
stones
15th
anniversary
brew
is
the
mark
to
hit
for
this
style
right
now
that
beer
is
just
too
good
that
said
this
may
be
more
available
than
that
is
cheers
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
was
a
nice
oil
black
color
with
a
decent
finger
milk
chocolate
head
the
aroma
is
bold
and
full
of
hops
spice
pine
and
strong
citrus
are
all
present
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
a
decent
malt
up
front
with
hints
of
caramel
and
burnt
grains
the
finish
is
all
hop
most
notably
citrus
almost
to
the
point
of
over
powering
all
the
other
flavors
despite
this
the
medium
to
light
body
and
good
carbonation
round
out
this
beer
a
newer
style
with
lose
parameters
this
brew
fits
the
bill
and
is
a
good
example
overall
one
of
if
not
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
well
balanced
not
too
rich
definitely
a
goto
for
me
o
new
glarus
is
solid
and
this
is
another
good
one
from
them
happy
to
get
a
chance
to
try
this
one
will
try
again
black
pour
with
a
big
head
of
tan
lacing
a
near
perfect
balance
of
rich
roasted
malts
smoked
notes
dark
earthy
and
piney
hops
warming
only
brings
the
hops
to
the
front
even
more
and
allows
them
to
steal
the
show
quick
hitting
and
bitter
as
the
first
sip
hits
your
palate
it
was
amazing
how
smooth
overall
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
into
this
one
but
after
it
warmed
i
really
liked
it
i
am
still
looking
for
a
black
aleipa
to
knock
off
stone
15th
anniversary
as
the
best
in
the
category
this
one
is
a
must
try
if
you
are
exploring
the
style
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
unique
and
expertly
balanced
overall
a
great
ipa
and
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
a
great
pine
hop
profile
that
doesnt
overwhelm
but
pleases
there
is
also
a
great
balance
with
the
malt
and
while
7
very
little
alcohol
taste
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
slight
fluuf
offwhite
head
scent
has
chocolate
malts
molasses
and
bitter
hops
in
the
mix
basically
the
taste
is
a
more
robust
version
of
an
ipa
it
still
has
a
bitter
taset
throughout
but
is
nicely
complimented
by
the
sweet
tastes
of
chocolate
and
molasses
a
very
complex
beer
that
overloads
the
taste
buds
at
first
making
for
a
great
sipping
beer
a
great
brew
using
a
more
unique
style
that
you
just
dont
find
too
many
of
in
your
local
beer
store
a
must
try
nice
almost
sessionable
balanced
ipa
overall
probably
the
most
drinkable
black
ipa
that
ive
had
it
depends
on
your
mood
and
taste
to
decide
whether
that
is
right
for
you
this
is
almost
sessionable
but
is
7
it
certainly
is
black
and
it
has
a
good
amount
of
hop
aroma
its
not
exceptional
in
any
way
o
not
too
bad
i
felt
the
flavor
profiles
were
sort
of
fighting
for
dominance
with
the
hops
just
squeaking
out
a
victory
i
still
dont
know
what
to
think
of
this
black
ipa
style
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
great
carbonation
its
hearty
but
at
the
same
time
easily
drinkable
a
well
made
beer
as
ive
come
to
except
from
new
glarus
for
a
brewery
that
does
not
focus
on
hops
too
much
i
was
glad
to
see
them
release
this
and
hopefully
it
will
be
brewed
again
sometime
overall
yum
for
a
brewery
that
shies
away
from
hops
for
hops
sake
they
can
sure
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
they
want
the
hops
to
shine
great
malt
profile
on
this
one
too
just
enough
to
keep
the
hops
in
check
pleasant
clean
and
easy
drinking
this
could
almost
qualify
as
a
sessionable
black
ipa
of
the
for
new
glarus
brews
ive
tried
thusfar
it
is
easily
my
favorite
certainly
worth
a
try
and
one
which
i
am
glad
to
have
a
few
more
from
that
6pack
in
my
cellar
overall
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
and
will
definitely
seek
it
out
again
it
has
a
unique
hops
profile
and
a
lot
of
character
another
exceptional
brew
from
new
glarus
hop
forward
but
more
in
the
flavor
than
bitterness
a
pretty
great
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
even
with
the
complexities
being
thrown
at
the
palate
o
really
like
this
beer
good
black
ipa
its
well
balanced
tasty
and
very
drinkable
ill
seek
this
one
out
once
theres
some
more
room
in
the
fridge
again
o
a
great
sessionable
cda
if
you
have
the
means
i
highly
recomend
picking
some
up
o
this
is
a
really
nice
example
of
this
new
style
easy
drinker
well
balanced
good
flavor
d
a
new
style
but
new
glarus
simply
nailed
it
with
this
new
offering
of
theirs
a
near
perfect
balance
of
what
i
have
always
looked
for
in
this
style
but
never
found
a
solid
roasty
backbone
with
a
finish
of
citrus
hops
well
done
as
always
new
glarus
i
am
by
no
means
an
expert
in
this
style
but
i
really
think
this
is
the
shining
example
i
have
been
looking
for
overall
good
beer
good
balance
but
it
does
a
good
job
of
creating
a
good
black
ipa
overall
a
really
good
beer
its
a
very
good
change
of
pace
o
i
like
this
beer
and
love
the
smell
of
this
beer
but
it
fails
to
live
up
to
the
standards
of
what
i
consider
a
great
goto
beer
still
i
would
get
this
again
black
top
pours
a
black
color
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasted
with
the
beer
there
is
a
nice
dark
hoppy
smell
i
would
imange
heaven
smells
like
this
the
taste
has
a
realllly
nice
hoppy
tone
to
it
but
doenst
over
power
a
dark
sorrta
flavor
very
nicely
carbonated
not
overpowering
but
not
weak
either
fantastic
balance
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
loved
it
would
easily
get
more
o
good
black
ipa
have
had
better
bigger
black
ipas
but
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
nice
roasted
malt
and
hop
bitterness
o
i
really
like
this
beer
its
like
a
sweet
ipa
definitely
picking
up
a
few
more
packs
of
this
bad
boy
do
this
beers
strength
lies
in
its
balance
which
isnt
necessarily
the
most
likely
feature
to
be
expressed
in
a
black
ipa
unfortunately
it
is
also
boring
unable
to
deliver
that
onetwo
punch
of
unlikely
flavor
combination
that
has
made
the
roasty
and
hoppy
style
so
suddenly
popular
perhaps
when
the
dust
settles
and
the
style
moves
beyond
the
tumultuous
throes
of
speciation
it
will
be
the
new
glarus
black
tops
and
drakes
batch
3000s
of
the
black
ipa
world
that
ultimately
endure
o
hops
and
malt
work
like
a
team
throughout
the
whole
stretch
of
the
way
cruisin
for
a
wonderful
finish
of
balanced
beauty
abundantly
flavorful
and
good
to
the
last
drop
new
glarus
black
top
is
one
fantastic
black
ipa
overall
if
you
get
the
chance
drink
this
black
ipa
i
am
new
to
this
style
but
i
love
this
beer
great
first
attempt
at
this
style
new
glarus
brewing
co
this
beer
really
surprised
me
i
will
be
returning
to
wisconsin
for
another
6
pack
if
you
see
it
try
it
this
beer
drinks
more
like
a
nicely
hopped
english
porter
or
maybe
its
time
for
black
english
ipa
a
very
sessionable
drink
and
a
perfect
afternoon
beer
for
me
new
glarus
continues
to
impress
with
a
good
pour
i
get
a
foamy
and
pillowy
3
finger
tan
head
appears
fairly
clear
and
as
a
deep
brown
copperamber
lots
of
interesting
aromas
here
bright
almost
candy
like
fruit
grapefruit
and
even
strawberry
comes
at
me
milder
pine
and
citrus
hops
round
out
the
overall
bouquet
nice
hop
bite
up
front
with
citrus
character
perfectly
rounded
by
a
mellow
roasted
malt
base
caramel
toasty
chocolate
all
present
but
not
overpowering
especially
given
the
color
there
is
a
slight
smokiness
to
the
finish
body
firmly
in
the
middle
on
this
one
nice
hop
resin
feel
creamy
overall
very
good
highly
drinkable
excellent
o
nice
representation
for
the
style
very
light
on
the
malt
backbone
and
mouthfeel
could
be
somewhat
thicker
i
gotta
say
this
is
a
stellar
example
of
a
black
ipa
easy
smooth
with
definite
drinkability
new
glarus
nailed
this
one
in
a
big
way
overall
pretty
good
nice
hop
profile
that
really
explodes
some
nice
malts
to
back
it
up
nothing
goes
over
the
top
or
out
of
place
drinkable
and
tasty
overall
another
good
new
glarus
beer
could
drink
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
and
the
higher
abv
kinda
sneaks
up
on
you
overall
its
a
just
a
good
black
ipa
nothing
to
special
but
not
bad
either
d
pretty
solid
brew
by
new
glarus
really
nicely
balanced
and
chock
full
of
flavor
on
both
sides
highly
recommended
as
this
is
a
side
of
ng
i
havent
seen
before
o
this
is
a
solid
easytodrink
offering
from
new
glarus
tossing
back
a
few
in
one
evening
wouldnt
be
a
problem
overall
i
find
this
a
delicious
beer
but
isnt
exactly
within
the
style
i
think
i
honestly
prefer
the
moon
man
ipa
offering
from
new
glarus
but
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
do
if
i
were
blindfolded
the
thought
of
this
ipa
being
black
would
never
have
crossed
my
mind
cheers
to
dan
and
co
for
tackling
a
newer
american
beer
style
even
if
theyre
the
domestic
masters
of
classic
german
styles
highly
recommended
note
even
though
the
review
score
averages
out
to
an
a
this
is
a
b
beer
in
my
opinion
pretty
good
beer
generally
i
dont
care
for
dark
hoppy
brews
but
there
are
exceptions
and
this
is
one
of
them
poured
a
lovely
light
tan
thick
foamy
billowy
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
lots
of
lace
color
is
a
very
dark
clear
garnet
with
some
bubble
trails
seen
with
a
flashlight
aroma
is
very
hoppy
with
pine
citrus
and
pineapple
predominant
along
with
malt
flavor
is
similar
to
nose
and
i
dont
pick
up
much
of
the
roastiness
that
i
expected
body
is
good
and
ditto
carbonation
finish
is
fairly
long
ending
with
fresh
hop
good
drinking
beer
overall
the
hops
dominate
but
theres
enough
balance
to
prevent
the
hops
from
burning
you
out
i
expected
more
malt
flavor
since
its
a
dark
ipa
but
its
more
hops
than
anything
the
hop
profile
is
good
a
balance
of
pine
and
citrus
hops
another
very
well
done
beer
from
new
glarus
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
and
its
growing
on
me
even
more
i
hope
it
hangs
around
no
trace
of
alcohol
despite
the
nearly
7
abv
easy
to
down
more
than
a
few
of
these
and
well
worth
the
trip
to
wisconsin
to
pick
some
up
pours
a
dark
mahogony
brown
beautiful
colour
lots
of
offwhite
frothy
head
smells
very
hoppy
some
roastiness
peaking
through
definitely
very
drinkable
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
low
carbonation
levels
despite
not
being
a
huge
black
ipa
fan
this
was
fairly
tasty
quite
sessionable
o
very
nice
beer
good
work
another
hit
from
new
galarus
overall
although
this
beer
largely
lacks
the
deep
roasted
character
of
a
black
ale
and
it
isnt
potently
bitter
like
many
ipas
today
it
was
still
quite
a
pleasure
to
drink
thanks
orbitalr0x
for
the
bottle
o
very
solid
very
drinkable
while
the
hops
melded
fairly
nicely
with
the
roasted
malt
components
there
were
a
few
flaws
that
kinda
stuck
out
a
bit
too
much
for
me
to
be
completely
sold
on
this
one
o
wow
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
one
more
reason
i
am
thankful
to
have
new
glarus
brewing
co
located
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
o
this
is
a
really
good
beer
and
like
the
best
of
new
glarus
its
perfection
is
slowly
revealed
any
doubts
that
the
black
ipa
style
is
a
gimmick
should
be
dissplled
by
this
brew
and
the
other
myth
of
this
style
being
only
done
well
by
the
west
coast
brewers
is
shattered
another
big
win
for
a
championship
team
this
is
another
great
drinkable
brew
from
new
glarus
its
nice
that
they
ventured
into
this
style
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
this
is
not
the
best
black
ipa
ive
had
but
certainly
one
of
the
most
drinkable
something
new
glarus
always
keeps
in
mind
for
the
wisconsin
consumer
this
brew
could
benefit
by
more
of
a
coffee
and
roasted
malt
flavor
profile
all
in
all
another
unusual
in
a
good
way
offering
from
ng
good
work
people
keep
it
up
still
a
seemingly
incongruous
meeting
of
elements
these
black
ales
you
dig
it
or
you
dont
although
not
all
are
created
equal
this
one
is
better
than
most
id
heard
great
things
about
new
glarus
before
i
moved
to
the
midwest
and
this
beer
did
not
disappoint
ive
enjoyed
this
black
ipa
above
all
others
ive
tried
since
the
trend
took
off
mostly
because
the
contrast
of
looksmell
and
taste
is
so
pronounced
looking
forward
to
trying
more
new
glarus
brews
better
than
a
lot
of
beers
of
this
style
the
black
is
not
just
color
but
has
some
flavor
edit
just
saw
this
beer
won
gold
medal
at
gabf
impressive
considering
how
competitive
the
style
category
is
this
year
it
looks
like
im
not
alone
in
thinking
this
beer
is
the
epitome
of
the
style
this
has
become
my
second
favorite
new
glarus
brew
after
their
worldclass
wisconsin
belgian
red
very
nice
worth
trying
this
is
one
of
the
top
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
ones
for
the
style
as
well
this
is
an
absolutely
well
done
american
black
ale
the
nose
is
killer
and
the
overall
beer
is
a
real
treat
now
the
thing
that
this
beer
does
exceptionally
well
is
in
the
nose
this
is
the
first
beer
in
a
long
long
time
that
i
can
remember
smelling
so
good
from
all
the
way
across
the
room
from
my
pint
glass
the
nose
really
carries
that
far
heady
scents
of
pineapple
mango
pine
resin
and
roasted
malts
as
if
from
a
porter
mingle
together
in
a
combo
that
really
makes
me
salivate
for
some
reason
tastes
of
all
the
things
promised
by
the
nose
and
also
some
interesting
interplay
between
a
sweet
caramel
malt
tone
that
plays
hide
and
seek
with
a
roasted
more
bitter
malt
finish
is
relatively
straightforward
bittering
overall
a
fantastically
wellexecuted
bipa
im
not
too
familiar
with
black
ipas
but
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
lot
and
look
forward
to
enjoying
it
and
other
black
ales
again
overall
ive
had
some
top
shelf
beers
in
the
last
couple
of
days
but
this
is
really
standing
out
for
me
i
dont
consider
myself
an
ipa
kind
of
guy
but
this
is
everything
that
is
right
about
ipa
as
a
matter
of
fact
im
calling
it
a
night
as
i
feel
ive
reached
the
pinnacle
overall
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
some
time
changes
this
beer
fresh
as
it
is
now
it
is
amazing
this
is
easily
my
favorite
new
brew
of
new
glarus
since
the
crackd
wheat
i
have
enjoyed
two
women
thus
far
but
i
thought
the
edel
pils
was
a
much
better
example
of
a
similar
beer
in
the
new
glarus
stash
of
recipes
it
is
still
kind
of
jumbled
but
at
least
black
ipas
are
evolving
into
something
a
bit
more
drinkable
d
very
strange
combination
the
aroma
seems
like
a
completely
different
beer
than
the
tastemouthfeel
everything
great
about
the
aroma
just
disappears
o
i
tend
to
look
at
cascadian
dark
ales
as
a
fullflavored
beer
that
blows
your
palate
but
you
can
only
have
one
or
two
a
night
i
could
probably
drink
10
of
these
if
i
had
to
but
thats
not
really
a
good
thing
its
pretty
watery
and
lacking
the
robust
flavor
promised
by
the
roasty
hoppy
aroma
ng
tends
to
make
more
approachable
beers
which
this
is
but
maybe
not
every
style
needs
to
be
made
approachable
i
would
say
this
is
the
first
new
glarus
beer
ive
had
where
they
really
dropped
the
ball
its
a
black
ipa
but
not
a
very
good
one
i
fear
the
complexity
that
longer
roasted
malts
should
have
offered
to
the
brew
is
not
here
at
6
9
i
say
its
out
of
the
realm
of
sessionablity
but
it
doesnt
offer
enough
in
the
taste
or
feel
characteristics
to
be
something
i
would
consider
a
good
beer
to
sit
down
and
really
enjoy
overall
im
not
sure
what
to
think
racer
5
ipa
is
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
out
there
and
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
i
was
planning
on
doing
a
taste
test
between
this
and
sublimely
selfrighteous
but
think
im
gonna
save
that
one
for
tomorrow
maybe
this
beer
had
a
different
and
maybe
better
profile
a
year
ago
i
will
have
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
and
maybe
rereview
at
a
later
date

overall
this
is
an

all
around
great

and
roasted

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
quite
a
unique
beer
to
me
i
dont
think
ive
had
a
black
ale
that
was
also
an
ipa
though
im
not
really
a
fan
of
the
latter
nonetheless
this
was
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
it
was
well
balanced
and
robust
id
have
it
again
and
id
recommend
would
definitely
order
again
i
give
up
on
the
style
i
cant
get
used
to
it
it
just
doesnt
work
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
easy
drinking
feel
which
is
a
slight
surprise
since
it
is
an
8
1
abv
beer
its
smooth
with
a
nice
aftertaste
that
hangs
but
does
not
linger
this
beer
has
been
better
than
i
expected
pours
a
gorgeous
deep
black
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
it
looks
quite
nice
and
true
to
its
style
scents
of
licorice
caramel
malt
molasses
some
smokey
aromas
some
faint
muted
pine
and
notes
of
citrus
a
muted
aroma
compared
to
many
hop
forward
beers
but
quite
nice
very
unique
and
enticing
and
quite
different
from
other
black
ipas
ive
tried
flavor
begins
fairly
sweet
with
big
hits
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
moves
into
slight
pine
and
citrusy
hop
flavors
with
a
moderate
level
of
bitterness
ipa
level
alongside
roasted
malt
and
more
chocolate
the
hop
presence
is
largest
at
this
point
the
finish
is
pine
resin
bitterness
with
some
chocolate
roast
malt
and
black
coffee
aftertaste
is
pine
resin
roast
malt
and
black
coffee
bitterness
mingling
nicely
a
good
flavor
profile
combining
the
roasted
chocolate
and
coffee
flavors
of
portersstouts
with
the
caramel
malt
and
intense
hops
of
an
ipa
and
doing
so
in
fantastic
fashion
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
resinous
and
sticky
with
a
semidrying
feel
and
a
moderate
level
of
prickly
carbonation
a
very
nice
feel
that
aids
the
drinking
experience
nicely
overall
this
is
an
excellent
black
ipa
it
combines
the
best
aspects
of
ipas
and
the
porterstout
family
into
a
very

uniquely
aromatic
and
drinkable
experience

overall
very

to

a
great
black
ipa
compared
to
most
versions
out
there
im
usually
telling
myself
this
just
tastes
like
a
hoppy
porter
overall
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
has
a
unique
flavor
that
other
black
ipas
dont
have
the
smoked
malts
and
cocoa
are
a
dominate
flavor
with
strong
citric
fruits
at
the
backbone
a
nice
pleasurable
drink
that

try

i
didnt
love
this
beer
it
was
quite
good
enough
to
keep
sipping
but
yet
i
never
stopped
and
said
that
pops
you
know
like
buddy
christ
so
i
prefer
this
style
to
have
a
deeper
flavor
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
so
i
recommend
trying
it
as
its
take
on
the
style
might
be
more
up
your
alley
o
an
interesting
balance
and
interplay
between
the
sweetness
of
the
cocoa
and
bitterness
of
the
hops
and
the
char
this
is
an
interesting
diversion
from
some
of
the
more
common
styles
but
nothing
compelling
o
the
black
ipablack
ale
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
is
my
favorite
style
of
hoppy
beer
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
ive
never
had
a
hoppy
beer
i
like
more
than
this
one
that
said
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brewery
from
the
batches
they
were
going
to
send
to
the
great
american
beer
festival
black
nearly
opaque
but
faintly
clear
with
purpleruby
highlights
it
had
a
thin
skim
and
collar
of
tan
foam
that
produced
long
lasting
lace
and
showed
good
head
retention
the
aroma
was
full
of
roast
caramel
citrus
chocolate
and
toffee
very
nice
citrus
bitterness
cut
through
the
malt
but
notes
of
caramel
and
toffee
with
a
roasty
finish
were
still
evident
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
and
faint
alcohol
warmth
plus
slight
astringencydryness
from
the
dark
malts
very
tasty
it
had
a
bigger
malt
profile
than
i
expected
but
this
matched
well
with
the
hops
very
dark
light
tan
head
settles
down
quickly
to
a
light
lace
intriguing
aroma
notes
of
caramel
and
hops
taste
has
a
bold
bitterness
caramel
burnt
sugar
herbs
and
roasted
grains
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
cleanly
wet
overall
a
nice
mix
of
hop
bitterness
with
both
highly
roasted
and
some
sweeter
dark
crystal
notes
im
good
with
the
70
ibu
bitterness
the
hop
flavor
is
indistinctly
herbal
and
not
really
engaging
me
aroma
just
keeps
getting
better
as
the
beer
warms
not
typically
my
favorite
style
but
well
crafted
enough
i
will
certainly
try
it
again
pours
from
the
growler
into
an
imperial
nonic
a

atoparomas
are
full
on
pine
and
citrus
over
top
of
roast
and
bitter
chocolatetthe
way
it
should
be
in
my
opinion
sharp
and
pickly
pine
hops
on
the
palate
with
some
dryer
earthy
tonesome
roast
and
bitter
chocolate
comes
into
play
as
well
but
he
pine
resin
wins
out
this
is
what
i
want
and
expect
for
the
style
and
the
left
coast
once
again
brings
itlove
this
beer
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
sweetness
grainy
caramellike
and
unmistakably
so
with
a
mild
bitterness
and
moderate
hop
flavor
the
juiciness
from
the
hops
coupled
with
the
chocolatey
sweetness
from
the
grain
really
does
bring
to
mind
a
stout
with
citrus
peel
coffee
and
cream
are
prominent
especially
on
the
midpalate
a
little
bit
of
a
colalike
sweetness
is
present
on
the
finish
mildly
sweet
and
with
a
moderate
pine
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
mediumlight
bodied
beer
has
a
fantastic
creamy
carbonation
unfortunately
though
the
palate
is
just
a
hair
watery
while
the
alcohol
is
higher
than
it
needs
to
be
it
is
not
particularly
noticeable
a
solid
effort
as
one
who
has
come
to
enjoy
this
style
i
found
this
one
to
be
exquisite
cripsy
and
light
with
some
hoppy
chalkiness
on
the
mouthfeel
great
quaff
from
the
west
coast
to
be
sure
as
a
bear
might
agree
grrrr
now
booboo
lets
go
get
that
pikanik
basket
i
may
have
some
harsh
words
here
but
keep
in
mind
anything
thats
hoppy
by
nature
should
always
be
consumed
as
fresh
as
possible
i
had
a
chance
weeks
ago
to
pick
this
up
thats
my
fault
it
shouldnt
deter
you
from
enjoying
this
beer
though
o
good
but
not
one
of
the
better
racers
o
very
distinct
especially
with
the
pine
if
i
didnt
see
the
color
i
would
almost
peg
this
as
a
fullbodied
dipa
i
like
it
overall
another
great
beer
from
bear
republic
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
big
bear
black
stout
though
they
are
already
very
hop
forward
with
their
beers
they
really
should
have
hopped
the
shit
out
of
this
one
so
it
could
be
on
its
own
level
a
good
beer
worth
drinking
though
the
flavor
has
a
mild
pine
tinge
with
slight
hint
of
char
in
the
background
with
moderatly
citrus
flavored
hops
with
a
slight
yeast
fruitiness
and
light
raisiny
element
but
pine
and
grapefruit
outweighs
the
malt
strongly
with
some
pithy
flavor
which
makes
the
finish
seem
bitter
toward
the
end
with
mild
alcohol
warmth
overall
i
like
this
a
lot
pretty
great
example
of
the
style
and
i
was
pleased
it
met
my
expectations
considering
i
think
highly
of
the
original
racer

ipa
i
recommend
this
to
those
who
like

black
ipas
overall
this
is
a
delicious
beer
i
will
need
to
try
this
earlier
next
year
to
see
how
the
hops
truly
are
delicious

perfect
beer
to
drink
when
the
longhorns
are

gotta
love
it

ill
need
to

this

its

brings
out

charcoal
malt
and
vegetable
pine
hops
with
a
minty
grass
edge
nutty
and
leafy
malt
and
hops
jump
out
on
the
flavor
these
a
sharp
pine
idea
here
so
the
hops
definitely
come
forward
it
seems
a
touch
astringent
in
a
sort
of
chemical
sense
after
a
while
but
generally
it
holds
up
well
the
body
is
medium
or
better
and
the
feel
is
fairly
chalky
dry
with
tiny
bubble
providing
an
effective
carbonation
this
was
enjoyable
although
it
faded
on
me
a
bit
with
the
hop
recipe
here
o
excellent
brew
complex
flavors
and
aromas
and
enough
alcohol
to
make
it
interesting
o
a
style
i
tend
to
avoid
but
i
really
took
to
this
one
i
think
this
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
syout
than
other
cascadian
black
whatever
whatevers
ive
tried
regardless
of
why
i
liked
it
so
much
the
point
is
that
i
did
glad
to
spot
it
and
give
it
a
try
well
worth
seeking
out
o
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
be
as
roasty
and
bitter
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
but
is
pleasant
to
drink
in
its
own
regard
and
has
good
drinkability
tan
single

actually
coffee
roasted

and

for
the
aroma
flavor
of
earthy

nicely
balanced
with
roasted
malts
although
neither
is
especially
memorable
but
the
combination
is
excellent
medium
body
moderate
carbonation
and
semi
dry
finish
related
to
the
coffee
4
55
the
flavor
mimics
the
positive
aroma
the
malt
is
dark
in
flavor
but
without
any
burnt
elements
im
reminded
of
unsweetened
cocoa
no
milk
the
bitterness
is
more
pronounced
in
the
swallow
and
lasts
a
while
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
isnt
overbearing
the
body
leans
to
the
thin
side
but
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
overall
this
is
an
extremely
wellcrafted
wellbalanced
beer
it
would
be
very
easy
to
keep
drinking
this
one
all
afternoon
o
chocolate
up
front
then
a
hop
punch
in
the
finish
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
black
racer
is
good
beer
its
one
hell
of
a
bitter
hoppy
black
ipathats
for
sure
if
youre
looking
for
balance
here
keep
looking
having
said
that
it
is

really
tasty

my
pour
netted
a
dense

with
good

as
the

in
the

was
colabrown
with

only
at
the
edges
nose
was
roasty
and
smoky
with
an
underlying
mintiness

the

mouthfeel
was

finish
was

peppermint

taste
the
sensation
while
it
is
still
available
in

this
was
probably
one
of
the
best
of
this
style
imho
had
it
again
at
the
first
abs
meeting
second
season
bottled
man
this
beer
is
awesome
i
can
tell
my
palate
continues
to
evolve
i
love
this
one
even
more
the
second
time
around
o
this
is
another
good
offering
from
bear
republic
it
falls
short
of
the
best
black
ipas
around
but
im
glad
to
see
it
on
the
shelves
here
overall
i
was
really
excited
for
this
one
but
i
expected
more
juicinesshopswest

flavour
these
flavours
are
there
just
not

good
just
no

do
it
is

to

outstanding
wookey
jackand
in
this
case
the
comparison
is
not
a
favorable
one
black
racer
underwhelms
the
senses
for
such
a
strong
beer
at

abv
it
is
not
a
matter
of
errors
but
rather
a
misbegotten
role
of
easydrinker
being
forced
upon
it
racer
5
may
be
able
to
pull
off
such
a
role
but
this

seems
caught
in

i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
to
offer
the
senses
and
up
there
with
the
best
of
its
counterparts
overall
a
really
enjoyable

i
figured

it
had
to
be
good
overall
excellent
black
ipa
glad
to
have
picked
this
up
c
overall
pretty
nice
black
ale
another
one
to
add
to
the
lineup
black
racer
has
a
beautiful
pour
it
pours
a
very
deep
crown
with
a
massive
mocha
head
that
retains
very
well
the
aroma
is
strong
on
the
grapefruit
hops
and
the
taste
delivers
on
that
strong
at
first
but
also
provides
a
nice
chocolate
and
roasted
malt
finish
very
well
balanced
and
composed
the
mouthfeel
is
great
its
big
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
fantastic
yet
another
winner
from
bear
republic
their
hoppy
beers
are
truly
some
of
the
best
on
the
planet
this
beer
is
maybe
a
little
more
maltforward
than
expected
but
when
the
flavors
work
so
well
i
cant
complain
pours
a
very
dark
brown
opaque
in
the
glass
with
two
finger
thick
tan
head
spray
of
lace
down
the
glass
smell
not
much
going
on
ryeish
graininess
chocolate

pine
lemon
peel
milk
chocolate
note
lighter
medium

creamy
lower
carbonation
but
nice
nothing
special
going
on
but
was
enjoyable
this
is
a
fine
black
ipa
on
the
top
of
my
list
if
it
werent
for
wookie
jack
overall
i
find
myself
enjoying
this
o
decent
ive
had
plenty
that
are
better
in
this
style
which
im
quite
fond
of
which
makes
this
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
from
a
brewery
that
usually
impresses
overall
an
excellent
black
ipa
and
very
different
than
other
ipas
its
underrated
and
mellower
than
most
ipas
i
especially
like
the
balance
of
hops
bitterness
and
aroma
oi
continue
to
have
a
hard
time
getting
into
bear
republic
beers
this
is
an
assertive
fullflavored
black
ale
but
something
about
this
beer
is
offputting
to
me
perhaps
it
is
the
hops
they
use
which
are
impressive
in
strength
but
balance
strangely
against
the
malts
in
my
opinion
or
perhaps
it
is
the
slightly
heavy
feel
whatever
it
is
this
beer
like
racer
x
just
doesnt
turn
my
screws
overall
a
decent
black
ipa
black
as
night
body
tan
head
good
lacing
citrusy
nose
minimal
roast
aroma
taste
is
on
the
sweet
citrus
side
once
again
not
a
lot
of
roast
close
to
style
medium
mouthfeel
good
effervescence
i
like
how
they
minimized
the
roast
too
many
breweries
are
a
bit
heavy
handed
easy
drinking
i
wonder
how
this
is
a
bit
fresher
poured
at
the
top
in
gainesville
black
pour
with
super
thin
white
head
aroma
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
pine
hops
pretty
straight
forward
aroma
flavor
follows
aroma
exactly
buy
with
a
thickness
to
the
beer
i
was
not
expecting
hops
cut
through
the
thick
somewhat
chocolatey
malt
making
it
pretty
easy
drinking
nicely
done
black
ipa
but
outside
of
wookey
jack
this
style
can
only
excite
me
so
much
o
obsessed
with
the
ipa
the
west
coast
continues
to
spew
out
variations
to
keep
the
public
interested
this
black
ipa
lacks
malt
complexity
and
sports
an
average
hop
profile
overall
a
lackluster
offering
from
bear
republic
o
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
i
guess
id
like
a
more
hoppy
nose
and
a
more
hoppy
taste
basically
i
would
like
a
little
more
ipa
in
this
blend
but
its
pretty
good
d
this
was
a
solid
black
ipa
the
scent
was
good
the
taste
was
better
and
the
body
was
great
the
finish
was
smooth
with
well
hidden
alcohol
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
yum
o
its
really
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
style
22oz

an
inch
of

lots
of

the
aroma
is
roasted

sweet

pine
some
chocolate
and
earth
notes
the
taste
is
more
of
that
sweet

and

along
with
roasty
chocolate
slightly
bitter
pine
along
with
dark
chocolate
towards
the
end
smokey
roasted

at

mild

presence
somewhat
of
a
creamy
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
nice
balance
of
hops
and
the
chocolatey
roasted
malts
overall
a
well
crafted
black
ipa
worth
seeking
out
o
a
unique
take
on
the
black
ipa
not
as
amazing
as
bear
republics
other
offerings
but
still
quite
tasty
this
is
an
above
average
black
ipa
its
not
the
best
in
its
category
but
its
interesting
i
would
have
expected
a
more
intense
hoppy
presence
from
bear
republic
but
the
hops
here
are
pretty
good
my
only
complaint
with
this
beer
is
the
weird
vegetal
burnt
popcornlike
aroma
which
slightly
impacts
the
taste
regardless
this
is
definitely
worth
a
try
id
be
surprised
if
this
is
a
limited
brewedonce
beer
o
a
wonderful
beer
that
comes
highly
recommended
interesting
drinkable
and
most
importantly
tasty
d
super
enjoyable
brew
maybe
not
the
best
hot
weather
beer
but
enjoyable
o
really
nice
and
hope
to
see
this
one
more
overall
it
seems
this
is
a
style
that
will
promise
forever
and
never
deliver
im
always
looking
for
that
strong
hop
punch
combined
with
a
solid
well
developed
roasted
malt
backbone
ive
yet
to
find
it
and
frankly
i
dont
know
that
i
ever
will
i
dont
know
that
its
possible
for
those
two
extremes
to
cohabitate
in
the
same
beer
this
one
had
the
right
balance
but
missed
the
ideal
strength
of
either
end
its
not
bad
but
its
fairly
muddled
i
dont
know
that
id
give
this
one
another
go
o
as
far
as
american
black
ales
go
this
is
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
ive
had
much
more
maltforward
which
i
love
but
with
more
than
enough
hops
to
balance
yet
not
go
overboard
o
one
of
the
best
most
hop
forward
black
ipas
ive
had
could
hardly
tell
this
wasnt
a
normal
dipa
overall
its
a
shame
this
is
a
limited
thing
its
a
very
smooth
ipa
with
some
roasty
compliment
taste
nothing
offense
or
light
about
it
just
a
damn
good

bit
of

is

and
slight

of

meh
this
sort
of
reminds
me
of
the
collaboration
they
did
with
stone
i
honestly
expect
more
considering
this
is
themed
like
racer
5
racer
5
is
much
better
overall
its
a
decent
beer
really
but
i
was
expecting
something
so
much
better
from
bear
republic
really
this
should
be
setting
the
standard
for
a
west
coast
iba
but
it
really
feels
like
this
is
a
phonedin
effort
and
much
more
of
a
follower
than
a
leader
o
looks
good
tastes
good
and
smells
good
this
beer
is
a
real
winner
with
a
lot
of
hop
flavor
but
the
dark
malts
could
have
stood
to
bring
more
flavor
into
the
mix
than
just
performing
a
color
shift
overall
a
good
enough
beer
but
not
in
the
same
league
with
some
of
the
better
american
black
ales
out
there
thanks
alex
offers
a
nice
deep
hop
aroma
but
is
profundly
lacking
in
bitterness
in
my
view
a
hoppy
black
ale
indeed
nonetheless
quite
solid
and
worth
a
visit
overall
i
bought
this
on
chance
and
definitely
money
well
spent
thank
you
mike
at
superstar
beers
until
next
time
salud
d
very
tasty
black
ipa
get
it
fresh
a
surprisingly
maltforward
example
of
an
aba
especially
coming
from
this
brewery
not
a
bad
thing
per
se
but
i
was
kind
of
hoping
to
see
how
these
guys
approach
this
hybrid
style
with
their
usual
arsenal
of
hopitude
in
the
end
a
decent
mildly
hoppy
dark
ale
with
a
boozy
punch
that
you
sure
dont
see
coming
m
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
black
ipa
reminds
me
of
some
great
porter
qualities
mixed
with
that
hop
sweet
bitterness
we
all
love
the
blend
of
qualities
is
very
well
balanced
a
well
made
well
balanced
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
quite
dark
of
course
with
a
handsome
beige
head
pleasantly
sudsy
in
the
mouth
a
little
sharp
and
slightly
slick
huge
nose
of
flowery
and
piney
hops
somewhat
fruity
but
no
single
flavor
stands
out
a
little
on
the
dank
side
but
a
more
open
and
clean
flavor
for
the
most
part
the
touches
of
toffee
charred
grain
and
pineapple
upsidedown
cake
add
to
the
complexity
substantial
bitter
aftertaste
finally
from
the
22
oz
bottle
for
6

at
barons
marketplace
point
loma
blvd
overall
this
is
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
its
good
but
so
many
better
examples
of
better
american
black
ales
out
there
o
nice
black
ipa
a
lot
more
balanced
than
your
average
racer
5
or
racer
x
but
still
the
roasted
malt
barely
has
a
chance
to
get
going
at
the
same
time
doesnt
have
quite
the
sharpness
and
quality
of
flavors
that
i
get
from
something
like
a
racer
5
not
very
bitter
either
good
but
not
great
feel
like
its
missing
something
i
still
enjoyed
it
plenty
its
just
hard
to
follow
up
the
act
of
their
other
hoppy
beers
i
think
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
very
dark
almost
black
coloring
with
ruby
highlights
around
the
very
edges
and
a
thin
filmy
light
tan
coating
of
surface
head
aromas
of
roasted
hops
resiny
and
slightly
charred
and
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
sweetness
flavors
of
dark
sweet
malt
in
the
backbone
both
fruity
and
a
touch
of
molasses
with
a
resiny
bitter
slightly
fruity
hops
overlay
and
a
kiss
of
smoke
and
roast
very
balanced
on
a
full
smooth
body
tasty
brew
the
aftertaste
has
smoke
bitter
hops
and
roast
as
well
as
a
touch
of
chocolate
very
layered
and
dynamic
slightly
bitter
roasty
finish
that
lingers
long
enough
to
entice
more
drinking
overall
a
pretty
nice
cascadian
ale
but
id
like
too
see
more
hop
flavors
good
beer
but
second
tier
compared
to
others
in
the
style
overall
and
ok
beer
onion
flavor
doesnt
belong
in
this
style
though
o
pretty
good
not
great
though
friend
of
mine
plugged
it
as
better
than
woo
key
jack
he
lied
through
wont
seek
out
but
would
order
again
o
a
very
solid
bipa
that
i
would
love
to
be
year
round
doesnt
have
the
hop
bit
bitterness
that
racer

has
but
this
is
a

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of

on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly

this
is
a
good

that
is

nicely

a
great
tasting
alternative
from
some
of

buy
this

of

anything

with

absolute
stud
this
one
is
the
runt
unfortunately
o
i
love
racer
5
and
i
really
enjoy
a
wellmade
cda
this
is
not
one
of
them
the
hops
seem
to
have
been
muted
the
roast
was
moderate
but
this
beer
seemed
to
be
sloppy
in
a
way
and
there
was
a
weird
musty
graininess
that
really
had
no
pop
or
freshness
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
tap
room
a
story
of
cascade
emphasizing
the
hop
as

not
bad
worth
a
try
however
not
the
best
of
the
style
too
highly
carbonated
for
this
kind
of
beer
yet
another
good
variation
of
racer
5
though
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
black
ipas
so
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
for
the
style
its
good
though
nice
elements
from
stoutsipas
finish
follows
flavor
profile
to
just
make
this
a
wonderfully
appealing
and
nice
drinking
beer
o
a
rather
good
black
ipa
a
style
im
not
the
greatest
fan
of
but
i
enjoyed
this
effort
not
surprising
since
i
enjoy
racer
5
o
not
my
favorite
black
ipa
or
black
ale
but
one
i
did
enjoy
i
was
glad
to
see
bear
republic
come
out
with
something
new
like
this
i
would
definitely
order
it
again
o
a
very
well
balanced
cascadian
dark
ipa
i
really
enjoyed

ipas
ive
yet
to

with
the
possible
exception
of
the
slightly
more
tropical
lagunitas
night
time
the
balance
between
dark
roast
and
fruity
spicy
hops
is
nigh
perfect
no
mean
feat
even
for
some
pretty
reputable
craft
brewers
an
initial
flood
of
burnt
chocolate
pudding
raisins
and
wood
char
is
quickly
supplanted
or
perhaps
complemented
is
the
better
word
by
grapefruit
orange
mango
grape
and
lime
without
any
appreciable
flavor
clash
or
other
unpleasantness
somehow
starts
roasted
and
dry
while
finishing
sweet
and
fruity
with
a
pine
note
lurking
throughout
gets
spicier
and
more
resinous
over
time
but
clean
and
without
any
harshness
just
enough
green
flavor
medium
heavy
body
with
ample
chew
and
nice
middle
of
the
road
carbonation
this
changes
my
general
level
of
enthusiasm
for
this
style
from
lukewarm
but
openminded
to
keen
on
further
exploration
gotta
love
these
paradigm
shifts
that
occasionally
strike
the
ticker
like
lightning
one
of
my
favorite
black
ipas
o
it
is
good
i
liked
the
initial
taste
more
than
the
last
the
grapefruit
bitterness
builds
over
the
course
of
the
beer
virtually
eliminating
any
traces
of
the
mild
roasted
malt
very
dark
very
good
smoky
and
smooth
smells
like
pale
ale
creeper
strong
overall
an
excellent
cascadian
dark
ale
by
deschutes
brewery
hits
all
the
marks
in
terms
of
style
with
roasted
malts
and
an
earthycitrus
hop
profile
i
like
the
the
hops
held
off
until
the
finish
allowing
the
malts
to
showcase
their
roasted
flavour
a
real
hit
o
very
unique
dark
roasts
hoppy
beer
the
verdict
pretty
good
smells
like
an
ipa
tastes
like
dark
beer
at
first
as
it
warms
the

smooth
out

smokey
with
citrusy
hops
first
taste
is
of
citrusy
hops
followed
by
the
earthy
smokey
stout
flavors
finishes
very
dry
with
long
lingering
citrus
hops
bitternes
mouthfeel
is
creamy
smokey
coating
of
a
stout
but
lighter
like
a
porter
pours
out
a
deep
dark
brown
almost
black
with
ruby
highlights
and
a
thin
khaki
head
smells
of
ash
toasted
and
burnt
grain
along
with
resinous
and
citrusy
hops
flavor
has
a
caramel
malt
backbone
with
tinges
of
roasted
malts
fruity
esters
are
present
hops
are
big
on
citrus
peel
and
have
an
earthy
character
finishes
bone
dry
with
a
balanced
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
moderate
in
weight
with
a
soft
and
lightly
tingly
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
black
ipa
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
and
affordable
black
ipa
admittedly
the
style
is
one
of
my
favorites
but
this
beer
is
just
done
right
it
isnt
groundbreaking
but
it
is
very
good
this
beer
is
a
solid
execution
of
the
style
the
nose
gives
it
away
as
being
dark
with
its
roasted
appeal
but
based
on
flavor
alone
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
guess
this
is
a
dark
ale
it
is
medium
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
level
pretty
decent
per
style
and
very
aggressively
hopped
if
i
had
to
drink
a
black
ipa
id
reach
for
this
one
overall
very
good
nice
amount
of
hops
malts
and
coffee
balanced
well
nothing
is
overpowered
but
this
beer
comes
up
a
little
thin
and
weak
still
very
good
and
recommended
for
the
black
ipa

o
this
is

wellmade
black

this
style
has
been
growing
on
me
in
the
past
year
and
would
put
this
up
there
against
mbcs
weez
in
my
top
five
i
hope
that
va
can
get
deschutes
one
of
these
days
until
then
ill
keep
ordering
and
enjoying
overall
a
solid
cda
pretty
balanced
pretty
delish
itd
be
nice
to
have
a
fresher
one
to
compare
with
why
the
hell
isnt
it
available
in
nevada
o
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
porter
than
a
strong
black
ipa
but
very
tasty
as
it
were
i
happen
to
have
on
queensryche
jet
city
women
which
paired
quite
nice
d
a
stellar
american
black
ale
that
lags
the
best
in
class
by
just
the
slightest
of
margins
a
bit
more
aroma
and
a
bit
more
of
a
well
rounded
taste
and
mouthfeel
would
elevate
this
one
to
epic
regardless
this
is
a
rock
solid
offering
from
the
fine
folks
from
deschutes
who
continue
to
impress
me
since
entered
the
pa
market
i
can
easily
recommend
without
hesitation
overall
this
one
is
extremely
good
and
very
enjoyable
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
thick
fluffy
head
with
pretty
good
retentionleft
a
nice
ring
of
foam
and
good
amount
of
lacing
nose
is
a
nice
combination
of
pine
and
malt
some
coffee
and
chocolate
hidden
in
there
as
well
balanced
taste
of
the
malt
and
hops
you
get
the
hops
initially
with
a
malt
backbone
bitterness
hits
the
tongue
first
and
the
sweetness
flushes
in
before
ending
with
hops
again
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
right
in
the
middle
not
too
light
and
not
too
heavy
wellbalanced
and
nice
carbonation
which
makes
it
easy
to
drink
overall
a
solid
black
ipa
i
like
stouts
and
ipas
separately
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
deschutes
makes
this
well
taste
gives
you
some
hops
up
front
then
slightly
sweet
faint
chocolate
and
roasted
beans
in
a
nice
malt
that
is
thin
and
easy
to
drink
the
aftertaste
is
just
slightly
bitter
combination
of
the
hops
and
subtle
coffee
but
smooth
this
beer
keeps
hinting
hoppy
porter
but
has
enough
of
a
touch
of
sweetness
to
make
it
a
dark
ale
i
would
compare
it
to
a
hoppy
sweet
black
butte
very
good
black
ipas
are
always
a
toss
up
this
one
is
not
offensive
the
malt
and
hops
dont
clash
but
for
me
they
dont
really
improve
each
other
either
seems
a
touch
disjointed
o
very
nice
black
ipa
similar
in
a
lot
of
respects
to
lagintas
nighttime
this
is
my
second
example
of
this
particular
style
this
evening
and
this
deschutes
version
is
superior
to
the
one
i
drank
earlier
lagunitas
an
excellent
brew
with
a
complex
and
satisfying
flavor
while
the
classic
oregonian
willamette
valley
is
well
represented
with
acute
citrus
bittering
i
expect
more
tropical
orchard
and
citrus
variety
to
allow
the
hops
to
take
better
command
if
its
malty
rival
final
verdict
good
smooth
balance
on
coco
and
hops
very
smooth
me
drinkable
overall
this
is
more
of
a
serious
take
on
your
black
ale
where
many
black
ales
will
meet
the
dark
smokiness
of
the
malts
and
any
bitterness
of
the
hops
with
a
sugary
sweetness
of
inclusions
or
more
commonly
of
a
secondary
fruity
hoppiness
here
you
get
the
unabashed
raw
side
while
we
prefer
our
black
ales
to
have
more
of
that
sweeter
balance
this
brew
works
well
with
the
chord
it
has
struck
we
do
lose
a
fair
amount
of
pointage
on
the
nose
which
comes
across
dull
and
dry
warmth
does
help
it
along
a
bit
as
it
does
with
the
thick
creaminess
of
the
feel
but
it
doesnt
quite
eradicate
those
initial
misgivings
this
is
a
very
nice
black
ale
c
d
a
if
you
will
but
we
dont
feel
it
entirely
and
adequately
represents
the
bulk
of
what
you
should
expect
from
the
style
d
overall
a
fairly
hopped
ale
that
is
well
represented
from
the
darker
grains
out
there
not
earth
shattering
but
certainly
a
well
made
american
black
ale
as
with
anything
hoppy
drink
it
now
o
by
far
my
favorite
black
alecascadian
dark
ale
great
balance
easily
drinkable
and
full
of
great
flavors
overall
a
lot
like
their
obsidian
stout
which
i
love
this
beer
has
some
very
fine
qualities
ooverall
a
fantastic
black
ipa
or
what
they
like
to
call
it
a
cascadian
dark
ale
worth
picking
up
and
enjoying
deschutes
is
a
great
brewery
and
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
like
many
of
their
beers
this
is
a
solid
take
on
the
style
the
craftsmanship
really
sells
this
beer
for
me
and
makes
it
enjoyable
it
smells
a
little
better
than
it
tastes
its
a
nice
value
in
the
world
of
bombers
o
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
it
was
darker
and
fuller
than
most
black
ipas
ive
had
with
a
great
roasted
coffee
character
that
made
this
seem
like
a
stout
combined
with
the
fuller
mouthfeel
o
nice
flavors
nice
balance
very
drinkable
but
missing
a
wow
factor
i
also
prefer
this
style
to
have
a
more
prominent
roastiness
either
way
still
worth
the
try
and
still
very
good
overall
a
tasty
little
hoppy
dark
ale
but
it
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
my
favorite
two
or
three
in
the
same
style
range
that
said
i
would
encourage
anyone
who
likes
the
interplay
between
bitter
roasty
malt
and
citrusy
herbal
hops
to
check
this
one
out
overall
this
is
a
nice
drinker
i
would
like
to
see
stronger
hop
flavors
and
aroma
in
a
cda
they
seem
to
be
a
bit
buried
by
a
slight
overapplication
of
dark
roasted
malt
overall
deschutes
continues
to
deliver
with
this
offering
overall
very
enjoyable
especially
if
you
like
both
stouts
and
ipas
cheers
to
deschutes
again
and
again
and
again
overall
a
very
good
black
ale
very
bold
taste
but
the
hops
are
balanced
well
by
the
dark
malt
notes
o
not
bad
not
great
nose
left
me
wanting
more
o
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
deschutes
why
is
private
pyle
out
of
his
bunk
after
lights
out
why
are
you
not
stomping
private
pyles
guts
out
o
an
enjoyable
black
ipa
nice
roast
character
with
a
solid
bitter
backbone
happy
holidays
at
my
bro
in
laws
and
he
brought
back
a
lil
piece
of
heaven
from
oregon
the
hop
in
the
dark
is
a
dark
ale
that
hopped
with
cascade
hops
the
appearance
is
a
opaque
dark
with
a
offwhite
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
smell
is
big
piney
hops
the
taste
is
hoppine
leaning
dark
ale
there
isnt
as
much
roast
as
i
would
prefer
but
it
is
still
very
good
the
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
body
with
smooth
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
overall
good
solid
cda
though
a
little
too
piney
in
the
hops
for
my
liking
not
quite
as
complex
and
harmonious
as
some
of
the
better
cdas
ive
had
still
its
nothing
to
scoff
at
and
its
certainly
a
brew
id
love
to
try
from
the
bottle
o
i
dont
see
this
beer
as
an
ipa
the
70
ibus
are
lost
in
there
the
chocolate
and
coffee
win
the
flavor
race
and
will
not
give
up
it
is
not
bad
but
when
i
drank
this
id
had
enough
d
a
solid
but
not
special
bipa
a
nicely
drinkable
offering
from
deschutes
would
go
best
with
a
meal
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
if
we
widely
available
i
may
consider
picking
up
again
granted
i
had
to
order
this
and
have
it
shipped
into
the
state
i
doubt
ill
ever
have
it
again
fun
to
drink
certainly
is
more
right
than
wrong
a
good
representation
of
an
india
black
ale
but
still
enough
there
to
please
a
dark
beer
drinker
overall
love
the
chocolate
and
hop
balance
this
is
one
easily
consumed
beer
due
to
the
awesome
balance
of
this
beer
again
the
dark
ipa
impresses
me
as
a
lover
of
both
stouts
and
ipas
since
it
brings
them
together
and
deschutes
of
course
doesnt
disappoint
the
only
thing
that
leaves
me
wondering
is
what
did
the
almost
one
month
past
best
by
date
do
to
this
beer
the
best
cda
ive
had
so
far
this
one
blends
the
bitter
and
sweet
like
none
ive
had
before
and
shows
just
how
brilliant
this
style
can
be
when
pulled
of
well
o
yeah
this
is
amazing
stuff
i
love
the
black
ipas
as
a
nice
segue
from
ipas
which
are
my
preferred
beers
by
far
to
stoutsporters
which
im
too
nancy
to
try
bpa
from
lakefront
black
top
from
new
glarus
and
others
are
making
the
transition
quite
easy
a
fantastic
beer
and
for
the
price
you
might
as
well
get
a
ton
of
it
o
great
beer
were
heading
down
towards
the
best
by
date
so
im
not
sure
if
the
hops
would
have
been
more
vibrant
a
few
months
ago
i
might
have
liked
it
a
tad
more
then
either
way
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
have
this
again
o
too
good
to
be
true
really
like
this
beer
and
would
not
be
upset
to
have
to
drink
more
than
one
o
best
of
both
worlds
dry
roastiness
of
a
stout
with
up
front
delicious
hops
rare
to
drink
deschutes
and
extremely
satisfied
overallthis
beer
is
almost
too
balanced
to
be
memorable
everything
works
so
well
together
and
toward
the
same
goal
and
i
have
to
remember
that
this
isnt
an
ipa
or
a
porter
but
those
conflicting
signals
make
it
its
own
class
ive
had
this
style
a
few
times
cascadian
dark
ale
is
apparently
the
name
theyre
pushing
for
black
ipa
i
love
it
and
this
is
a
prototype
for
the
group
not
as
stunning
as
mountain
standard
was
to
me
the
first
time
but
as
solid
as
deschutes
always
does
i
love
all
things
deschutes
but
this
seems
to
be
falling
short
a
bit
it
carries
the
required
black
ale
character
but
it
isnt
blowing
me
away
or
even
keeping
it
interesting
really
its
kind
of
a
mundane
brew
that
isnt
really
memorable
unfortunately
o
super
great
beer
with
a
mass
appeal
as
usual
deschutes
packs
a
great
punch
with
a
beer
i
could
drink
every
day
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
just
missing
on
great
the
nose
is
nice
but
not
very
strong
and
the
taste
is
very
nice
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
to
bitter
and
the
feel
is
carbonated
but
too
light
and
thin
i
think
if
they
did
one
more
iteration
on
this
it
could
be
really
great
o
worthwhile
and
pretty
good
id
recommend
one
but
i
probably
wouldnt
jump
at
the
chance
to
buy
another
while
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
black
ale
black
ipa
genre
i
thought
this
was
an
overall
decent
beer
nice
to
have
a
deschutes
beer
since
its
not
available
around
here
pours
out
a
very
black
color
you
cant
even
see
the
reddish
hues
in
the
outer
edges
and
you
cant
see
the
carbonation
but
it
certainly
looks
like
theres
plenty
the
head
is
thick
dark
tan
and
very
soft
bubby
and
looks
just
like
heaven
should
i
got
a
two
finger
thick
head
and
it
just
wont
leave
your
side
its
got
a
rather
thin
aroma
some
roasted
malts
mild
dark
fruits
very
sweet
overall
raisins
figs
and
prunes
all
come
through
pouring
more
into
it
the
beer
cuts
right
through
the
head
like
an
all
too
tight
pair
of
jeans
on
an
all
to
fat
assit
leave
an
mark
to
say
the
least
its
rather
light
and
crisp
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
and
rather
light
bodied
but
as
it
travels
towards
the
back
of
your
mouth
it
feels
more
like
a
medium
bodied
beer
and
then
slightly
heavier
as
it
hits
the
back
of
your
throat
the
roasted
malts
re
strong
the
fig
and
raisin
come
through
pretty
well
too
its
slightly
bitter
overall
and
the
hops
are
well
hidden
until
you
get
to
the
aftertastethen
it
sort
of
kicks
you
in
the
tongue
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
i
would
categorize
this
beers
badassedness
right
up
there
with
a
remington
870
police
magnum
with
a
14
inch
barrel
a
damn
good
beer
by
and
large
a
great
beer
with
the
looks
of
a
classic
porter
another
pleasant
surprise
from
deshutes
looks
like
a
porter
smells
like
an
ipa
tastes
like
both
id
say
its
closer
to
an
ipa
but
the
dark
malts
are
noticeably
different
than
say
their
inversion
ipa
its
a
winning
combo
even
if
it
isnt
one
youll
reach
for
every
time
good
thing
its
a
special
release
beer
so
its
nice
to
see
it
turn
up
when
it
does
overall
absolutely
a
brew
worth
your
time
buy
it
try
it
it
is
very
unique
i
certainly
will
and
if
you
dont
like
it
send
it
my
way
because
ill
drink
it
anytime
o
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
well
put
together
beer
here
palate
pine
alongside
orangelike
citrus
theres
plenty
of
roastiness
a
hint
of
dark
chocolate
and
a
big
resinous
kick
in
the
finish
acidic
and
slightly
ashy
carbonation
feels
too
high
at
first
but
it
settles
out
quickly
this
is
hugely
flavorful
and
quite
bitter
perhaps
a
bit
too
sharp
for
its
own
good
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
dry
a
touch
thin
toward
the
finish
overall
mixed
feelings
here
its
good
but
feels
like
it
fell
just
shy
of
being
great
decently
priced
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
i
thoroughly
enjoy
this
beer
it
is
a
great
dark
beer
could
use
a
little
more
thickness
on
the
mouth
feel
o
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
very
well
done
great
balance
but
each
component
of
the
flavor
is
strong
on
its
own
as
well
i
grab
a
bomber
every
time
i
see
it
highly
recommended
overall
impression
and
the
winner
of
this
years
black
ipa
goes
to
deschutes
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
and
hope
to
go
back
to
this
one
on
draft
or
even
bottle
again
once
again
i
havent
seen
this
one
hit
the
mo
market
yet
so
had
to
go
to
it
a
real
interesting
take
with
a
mellow
hop
profile
for
this
style
nothing
better
from
deschutes
as
always
i
dig
it
this
is
a
fine
beer
im
not
sure
ill
drink
much
more
of
this
during
the
hot
texas
summer
months
but
i
can
see
revisiting
this
in
the
fall
or
winter
many
times
over
a
tasty
serviceable
here
like
ive
become
accustomed
to
from
deschutes
pretty
good
brew
i
was
excited
to
try
it
and
it
didnt
disappoint
yumy
hop
notes
with
a
nice
grassy
notes
balanced
by
some
good
burnt
malt
notes
smooth
texture
from
the
black
malt
not
particularly
sharp
sculpted
more
like
a
porter
in
regard
to
carbonation
the
palate
opens
with
a
blend
of
moderate
bitterness
and
a
lowlevel
but
sharp
grainy
bitterness
mildly
acidic
as
well
pine
grapefruit
and
a
little
bit
of
orange
are
all
noticeable
in
the
hop
bitterness
the
grainy
bitterness
does
mask
some
of
the
hop
flavor
and
the
light
unsweetened
cocoa
character
does
enhance
the
sense
that
this
really
is
a
hoppy
porter
the
midpalate
is
just
a
touch
watery
light
in
body
with
a
moderate
creamy
carbonation
this
beer
finishes
with
an
aggressive
pine
bitterness
a
little
bit
of
roast
and
some
citrus
excellent
stuff
this
o
pretty
damn
good
stuff
probably
would
be
a
regular
if
it
was
year
round
o
decent
brew
it
seems
like
its
missing
something
as
i
prefer
stones
ssr
better
o
a
tad
hoppy
for
my
taste
but
really
good
i
would
drink
this
one
again
for
sure
another
winner
for
deschutes
but
everyone
know
they
dont
fail
pours
hazy
black
with
a
thumbs
width
bubbly
mocha
head
nice
lacing
a
sharp
earthinesspineness
alongside
a
touch
of
some
citric
rind
starts
things
off
supported
by
some
coffee
and
chocolate
and
even
some
bread
smell
dulls
out
a
little
as
it
warms
flavor
offers
some
chocolate
coffee
pepper
pine
with
a
mild
to
moderate
bitterness
developing
throughout
the
sip
and
climaxing
in
the
finish
a
nice
creamy
and
silky
active
mouthfeel
overall
deschutes
made
me
enjoy
a
black
ale
though
still
not
a
style
i
find
myself
too
fond
of
most
black
ipas
that
i
have
tried
seem
to
have
a
strong
infusion
of
citric
fruit
which
this
one
doesnt
something
that
i
think
helped
me
enjoy
this
one
more
than
others
probably
not
a
beer
i
will
rush
to
have
again
but
still
one
i
am
glad
to
have
tried
and
have
enjoyed
trying
o
nothing
memorable
for
my
palate
ill
take
stones
ssr
over
this
one
all
day
everyday
but
hey
thats
for
me
and
this
one
might
be
for
others
not
the
best
of
this
style
but
right
up
there
nipping
at
their
heels
drinks
sooo
easy
o
another
solid
hit
from
deschutes
enjoyable
and
refreshing
deschutes
combined
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
chocolatey
smokey
roasty
flavors
of
dark
malts
with
the
piney
grapefruity
hoppy
flavors
seek
this
one
out
ive
had
better
black
ipas
this
ones
a
bit
of
a
mess
theres
a
lot
left
to
be
desired
with
this
brew
less
chocolate
and
more
delicate
hops
to
start
semirecommended
an
excellent
black
ipa
pours
very
rich
looking
thicker
and
an
aggressive
fizz
happening
2
inch
tan
head
with
nice
rentention
dark
brown
liquid
smells
like
bitter
pine
family
hops
and
chocolatey
roasty
earthy
malts
balanced
but
hop
forward
flavor
follows
suit
great
interplay
between
the
rich
velvet
of
the
malt
and
the
puckery
punch
of
the
hops
feel
is
lovely
as
well
very
creamy
in
the
mouth
with
a
fuller
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
damn
good
brew
which
ive
now
come
to
expect
regularly
from
deschutes
they
never
ever
disappoint
amazing
definitely
a
must
try
for
hop
lovers
cda
lovers
and
even
ipa
lovers
o
this
thankfully
was
not
oldno
hop
degradation
is
apparent
one
of
the
best
cdas
ive
had
maybe
stone
11th
was
better
i
love
the
hop
bite
dominates
with
the
roast
playing
second
fiddle
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
super
glad
the
safeway
down
the
street
has
it
at

a

will
seek
out
again
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
root
beer
head
aromas
of
malted
milk
balls
and
cascade
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
wet
but
less
viscous
than
the
eyes
would
lead
one
to
expect
a
delightful
mild
carbonation
scrub
on
the
finish
flavors
are
characterized
by
chocolate
and
tart
citrus
some
floral
essence
as
the
olfactory
becomes
more
involved
in
the
taste
lastly
a
little
smokiness
that
the
hop
bitterness
tends
to
perpetuate
ive
never
been
remarkably
impressed
with
this
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
its
better
than
average
but
by
deschuttes
standards
it
is
nothing
about
which
to
get
too
excited
especially
for
the
price
o
this
was
a
great
dark
ale
i
love
this
brewery
and
this
beer
is
a
very
nice
bitter
dark
beer
at
70
ibu
and
has
a
lot
of
hop
character
to
boot
this
is
a
very

beer
too
bad

overall
it
is
a
strongflavored
beer
that
gets
old
to
me
it
starts
with
an
interesting
flavor
and
gets
more
bitter
more
grapefruity
the
2011
batch
from
the
22
oz
bottle
d
a
wonderful
beer
true
to
form
and
very
balanced
the
definition
of
a
good
black
ipa
a
friend
picked
this
one
up
for
me
dark
brown
almost
black
pour
with
nice
tan
two
finger
head
with
good
retention
and
great
lacing
earthy
roasty
slightly
subdued
nose
with
hints
of
citrus
dark
chocolate
coffee
and
just
a
touch
of
pine
and
nuts
the
taste
is
noticeably
more
bold
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
profile
up
front
meshing
nicely
with
a
tangy
fresh
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
lots
of
dark
chocolate
and
espresso
and
as
it
warms
the
citrus
comes
alive
with
a
touch
of
pine
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
and
a
bit
oily
with
a
really
bitter
finish
most
of
the
black
ipas
ive
had
are
more
of
a
stoutipa
cross
where
this
was
more
of
a
porteripa
definitely
a
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
will
revisit
a
solid
offering
from
deschutes
o
i
would
love
to
have
this
fresh
on
tap
a
very
solid
and
wellbalanced
dark
ale
the
lack
of
coffee
or
cocoa
notes
keeps
it
from
being
confused
for
a
porter
hybrid
the
flavor
profile
is
diverse
and
quite
freshtasting
considering
the
date
on
the
beer
b
o
a
decent
brew
doesnt
have
any
outstanding
characteristics
but
still
a
good
brew
id
consider
having
another
one
black
fluid
this
beer
can
be
drunk
all
night
lond
very
drinkable
o
a
nice
and
drinkable
ale
with
a
good
flavor
and
body
o
drinks
like
a
black
ipa
should
i
actually
think
this
tasted
like
a
very
enjoyable
dark
session
beer
but
i
know
the
abv
is
a
bit
too
high
for
that
category
well
done
deschutes
cant
wait
to
visit
bend
one
of
these
days
mouthfeel
is
good
but
caught
me
off
guard
the
body
was
much
lighter
than
i
expected
this
being
much
like
your
standard
quality
ipa
light
bodied
with
full
flavor
which
creats
a
dangerously
drinkable
combination
a
solid
beer
from
a
brewery
that
i
more
and
more
wish
distributed
to
my
area
thanks
geoff
for
putting
this
one
in
the
box
oan
ok
beer
nothing
big
here
i
think
i
let
this
one
sit
for
a
little
too
long
decent
flavors
but
a
little
flat
also
would
have
liked
to
see
more
hops
and
a
higher
ibu
overall
i
would
say
that
the
sum
of
all
the
parts
melds
pretty
well
here
balance
and
integration
is
probably
not
a
goal
for
this
style
but
should
be
kept
in
mind
hop
in
the
dark
provides
some
direction
as
far
this
is
concerned
definitely
recommended
o
one
of
my
favorite
finds
of
2011
to
be
honest
i
wasnt
expecting
as
much
as
it
gave
me
especially
since
ive
only
seen
this
in
1
single
spot
the
place
i
picked
up
from
tonight
its
a
very
complete
halfipa
halfdarkale
style
brew
that
is
bound
to
leave
recepients
tastefully
filled
and
content
highly
recommended
to
absolutely
anyone
a
being
a
fairly
new
style
ive
only
had
a
few
black
ales
i
like
this
one
although
its
a
little
more
maltforward
than
the
others
ive
tried
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
styles
of
beer
and
deschutes
has
a
done
a
fantastic
job
with
it
it
has
a
great
diverseinteresting
taste
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
entire
bottle
i
wish
this
one
was
available
to
me
locally
o
deschutes
did
it
better
than
stone
i
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
without
being
needlessly
shitfaced
o
very
good
beer
nothing
less
is
expected
for
a
black
ale
coming
from
the
deschutes
brewery
this
is
a
must
try
overall
very
well
balanced
beer
the
mouthfeel
develops
well
creamy
and
full
backed
by
a
snappy
hop
bittering
quite
spicey
and
complex
excellent
craft
at
work
here
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
a
well
crafted
beer
interesting
brew
im
greatful
for
the
opportunity
to
taste
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
pretty
straightforward
its
not
trying
to
be
anything
that
it
isnt
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
make
itself
stand
out
against
the
best
beers
of
the
style
but
it
does
put
itself
in
the
conversation
a
very
nice
beer
for
the
changing
of
season
here
in
az
it
has
a
nice
mouth
that
is
slightly
oily
and
coating
o
this
beer
shines
much
brighter
on
draft
where
it
is
much
more
citrus
forward
just
above
average
otherwise
o
unlike
many
other
black
ipas
ive
had
this
one
isnt
very
good
with
some
age
on
it
i
should
probably
try
this
fresh
o
another
delightful
offering
from
deschutes
overall
i
must
say
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
in
a
fantastic
style
this
was
the
one
that
started
my
love
of
the
style
but
i
dont
believe
it
is
the
pinnacle
of
the
category
a
must
try
pours
a
thick
beautiful
twotoned
orange
and
tan
head
jet
black
color
aroma
is
a
pleasant
coffee

smell
flavor
is
like
a
chocolate
covered
coffee
bean
with
a
grassy
bitterness
thin
and
slick
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
overall
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
dark
ipa
a
black
ale
or
black
ipa
but
tasty
nonetheless
beer
is
medium
in
body
with
a
mild
bitterness
at
the
back
there
is
a
hop
palate
but
this
beer
is
mostly
a
sweet
porter
wtih
some
hops
in
it
im
a
little
let
down
there
is
close
to
no
bitterness
from
the
hops
or
the
roast
this
beer
could
have
done
a
lot
of
great
things
but
mostly
it
is
sweet
with
some
hops
in
it
oh
well
nothing
too
exciting
for
me
on
this
one
would
probably
be
better
with
a
little
more
dark
malt
o
great
all
around
the
style
isnt
made
to
produce
session
beers
though
for
me
the
high
point
was
the
smell
a
solid
drink
overall
temp
is
an
issue
as
it
was
better
as
it
warmed
verdict
one
damn
good
black
ipa
it
mixes
some
great
flavors
in
proper
balance
and
with
a
milder

abv
it
makes
for
great
drinking
certainly
worth
seeking
out
and
i
would
buy
again
if
i
ever
find
myself

it

the

is

easy
drinking
a

good
black
ale
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
very
good
o
a
really
great
aroma
but
once
you
drink
it
i
feel
like
the
hops
take
over
too
much
i
think
ive
finally
been
converted
to
the
bipa
style
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
cheers
this
was
a
treat
to
try
definitely
something
ive
been
looking
forward
to
having
for
a
while

with

nice
with

big
blast
of
citrus
hops
on
top
of
an
assertive
coffeeroasted
bitterness
feel
is
light
and
drinkable
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
worth
a
try
dr
its
easy
to
drink
for
its
relatively
high
abv
but
it
does
suffer
from
some
problems
with
the
hop
balance
the
price
is
a
bit
too
high
but
then
it
is
an
import
dissenters
may
argue
that
its
brewed
to
style

highly
recommend

i
have

so

only
an

if

and
your

slight
ash
flavor
not
as
hoppy
as
the
smell
would
indicate
but
not
too
bad
drinkability
i
find
this
beer
rather
drinkable
i
like
the
dark
ipa
style
though
so
that
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
though
this
beer
isnt
perfect
it
is
a
relatively
wellexecuted
example
of
the
style
drinkability
relatively
so
did
not
know
what
to
expect
with
this
beer
ive
had
other
black
ipas
and
didnt
really
care
for
them
but
i
am
glad
i
picked
it
up
a
very
drinkable
and
complex
beer
that
was
very
easy
for
me
to
finish
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
flavor
profile
not
your
typical
ipa
obviously
but
quite
good
pours
almost
black
with
mahogany
tinges
and
a
frothy
tan

roasty
coffeelike
aroma
freshened
by
leafyearthy
hops
coffee
flavors
slightly
burnt
and
edgy
come
through
first
with
a
generous
hop
bitterness
fairly
thin
body
for
the
amount
of
roasty
flavors
but
the
frothy
head
and
excellent
condition
of
the
beer
gives
it
a
nice
buoyant
mouthfeel
the
finish
is
dominated
by
earthy
leafy
pnw
hops
which
leave
a
quenching
bitterness
toasty
coffee
flavors
linger
a
very
nice
beer
whatever
the
style
i
might
call
it
an
american
porter
it
strikes
me
as
quintessentially
oregonian
and
it
reminds
me
of
the
dark
winters
i
spent
up
there
im
about
to
refill
my
glass
and
polish
er
off
try
this
beer
if
you
ipas
are
your
thing
i
want
to
try
more
of
these
cdas
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
more
of
a
hoppy
porter
to
me
but
they
can
call
it
whatever
they
want
to
interesting
cda
or
dark
ipa
not
nearly
as
big
as

ssr
but
hoppier
than
captn

maltier
than

ill
most
likely
buy
at

one
more
of
these
while
its
around
but
would
go
with
a
stong
sublimely
over
this
any
day
impression
were
it
possible
to
do
so
without
a

i
would

of
these

what

i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
d
not
one
of
deschutes
better
efforts
the
beer
is
kind
of
all
over
the
place
the
overall
flavour
isnt
up
my
alley
i
finished
the
bomber
fine
but
it
sure
took
me
a
while
not
something
id
realistically
want
more
than
10
oz
of
d
considering
this
is
a
bond
street
series
and
only
comes
in
bombers
i
could
see
myself
putting
a
couple
of
these
down
in
a
sitting
without
too
much
ill
effect
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
is
pretty
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
evening
d
one
of
the
few
only
disappointing
efforts
from
deschutes
i
really
liked
stone
11ssr
so
i
thought
this
one
would
be
right
up
my
alley
but
it
falls
short
good
drinkability
definitely
worth
a
try
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
recent
memory
pours
a
matte
black
color
with
a
foamy
tan
head
having
decent
retention
the
aroma
and
taste
very
much
go
handinhand
citrus
with
spicy
hops
up
front
with
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
the
malt
comes
out
more
with
the
finish
mediumbodied
and
relatively
smooth
perhaps
my
favorite
black
ipa
that
doesnt
have
a
crazy
abv
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
wish
this
could
be
more
widely
available
as
id
surely
get
it
more
often
im
not
entirely
on
board
the
cda
train
yet
but
i
still
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
as
for
the
style
this
seems
like
a
strong
hoppy
porter
to
me
theres
some
chocolate
and
caramel
but
its
mostly
the
tangy
ashy
roast
flavor
that
i
associate
with
porters
hops
are
medium
to
strong
for
a
6
5
abv
ipa
and
show
up
more
in
the
flavor
than
aroma
the
aroma
is
actually
a
bit
milder
than
i
expected
on
the
other
hand
the
beer
is
chock
full
of
flavor
its
quite
bitter
with
spicy
pine
resin
and
pungent
grapefruit
rind
the
roasted
malt
adds
further
bitterness
or
at
least
accentuates
the
hops
both
taste
and
aroma
are
balanced
between
strong
malt
and
hop
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
rough
i
could
see
this
beer
and
cdas
generally
growing
on
me
but
im
not
quite
there
yet
still
its
a
good
beer
and
ill
come
back
to
it
one
day

held

this

very

smell
for

ipa
this
is
not
my
first
black
ipa
but
this
one
stands
out
a
bit
you
can
smell
a
bit
of
roastiness
to
it
along
with
a
mild
hop
profile
i
want
to
say
that
im
also
getting
hints
of
dark
fruit
and
coffee
very
interesting
wow
is
there
some
reason
why
the

in

would
be
more

that

that
is

thats

do

of

next
comes
a

light

this
all
sits

a
faint
roasted

character
the
palate
starts
exactly
as
expected
with
a
pleasant
mix
of
hops
and
malt
base
the
finish
has
a
surprising
presence
of
vanilla
which
lingers
a
bit
on
the
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
smooth
an
rather
quaffable
limited
carbonation
the
finish
has
a
very
slight
charred
texture
and
turns
slightly
chalky
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
a
few
notches
below
best
in
class
american
black
ales
the
slightly
cloying
vanilla
presence
while
not
off
putting
detracts
slightly
from
the
other
charming
qualities
of
this
brew
having
now
worked
my
way
through
the
2nd
box
of
hops
offering
i
can
safely
say
the
flower
power
is
still
the
best
of
the
bunch
overall
its
hard
to
think
this
beer
is
9

alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
this
beer

will
revisit
this
one
again
this
a

and
intense

and
the

is
wellhidden
very
enjoyable
serving

flavorful
complex
and
robust

piney

in
two
words
if
you
will
it
is
a

meld
in
my
mouth
i
get
bitter
grapefruit
and
lemon
along
with
sweet
orange
it
rounds
out
into
a
malt
mouth
with
caramel
notes
and
plumb
in
the
background
the
myriad
of
flavors
is
complex
and
smooth
keeping
it
interesting
and
delicious
it
also
goes
back
and
forth
between
bitter
and
sweet
so
as
it
not
to
be
off
putting
or
cloying
this
is
an
excellent
brew
a
decent
take
on
the
style
will
definitely
appeal
to
those
who
like
bipa
to
feature
bitter
and
roast
overall
a
very
good
brew
nice
flavors
and
cover
the
strength
well
nice
roast
presence
and
good
hop
flavor
but
to
the
beer
nice
fruity
edge
in
a
black
ale
kind
of
way
seems
like
there
is
some
tasty
hop
oils
on
there
too
earthy
yet
balanced
and
bright
not
blowing
me
away
but
a
very
pleasant
drinker
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
body
with
a
strong
earthy
hop
presence
giving
off
some
dry
piney
bitterness
that
lingers
over
the
dark
malt
backbone
into
a
bone
dry
finish
resinous
oils
dank
buds
pine
needle
and
spruce
tip
followed
by
hints
of
burnt
toast
bittersweet
dark
chocolate
used
coffee
grounds
oatmeal
ash
caramel
and
toffee
pretty
robust
but
never
approaches
being
acrid
harsh
or
overly
roasted
complex
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
well
masked
abv
no
heat
with
very
little
alcohol
sweetness
in
the
finish
im
not
a
big
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
is
one
if
the
better
interpretations
of
the
style
that
ive
had
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
thick
sticky
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
but
isnt
anything
that
will
blow
you
away
that
being
said
the
combination
of
the
dark
toasted
malts
and
the
pine
and
floral
hops
is
very
interesting
and
worth
a
try
overall
too
smokymalty
for
me
but
drinkable
overall
this
is
essentially
a
hoppy
stout
dark
vine
has
a
strong
hop
flavor
and
a
good
supporting
cast
of
dark
malts
and
resilient
yeast
a
perfect
beer
to
drink
when
theres
snow
freezing
rain
and
sleet
outside
the
taste
of
dark
vine
has
a
mild
pine
hop
flavor
with
some
dark
roasted
keeping
up
and
slight
brown
sugar
element
of
crystal
malt
toward
the
middle
there
is
a
mild
citrus
tinge
from
the
hops
which
have
good
flavor
and
dominate
the
malt
however
there
is
enough
to
soften
the
flavor
and
give
a
more
balanced
flavor
of
burnt
malt
with
the
juicy
hops
trailing
toward
the
end
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
more
than
most
of
the
style
even
though
it
is
a
bit
more
malty
than
i
expected
considering
the
bitterness
level
of
some
of
the
other
hoppy
beers
in
the
repertoire
however
the
alcohol
is
pretty
well
hidden
making
for
a
drinkable
hoppy
black
ale
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
beer
not
too
bitter
or
roasty
very
balanced
reminded
me
of
the
15th
stone
black
ipa
but
less
bitter
worth
picking
up
paid
3
bucks
for
the
single
dark
vine
is
a
good
black
ipa
its
not
a
bad
pick
o
one
of
the
worst
black
ipas
ive
ever
had
its
too
extreme
and
unbalanced
theres
so
many
undeveloped
flavors
here
too
what
a
shame
considering
how
amazing
the
creeker
turned
out
to
be
i
love
the
black
ipa
style
this
is
by
far
the
strongest
black
ipa
ive
had
and
may
be
the
reason
for
the
distinctive
flavor
profile
poured
into
a
left
hand
glass
smells
like
an
ipa
tastes
like
a
dark
smokey
ipa
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
bite
first
sip
was
very
disappointing
however
the
warmer
the
beer
gets
the
better
it
becomes
i
suggest
drinking
it
five
minutes
after
pouring
and
dont
judge
it
till
youre
half
way
through
o
very
nice
brew
not
offensive
but
it
has
some
pronounced
notes
its
is
like
porter
meets
apa
over
buttered
popcorn
pleasant
pours
a
clear
dark
orangebrown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
roasted
malt
cocoa
citrus
zest
and
pine
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
cocoa
earth
and
citrus
zest
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
roasty
and
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
solid
aromas
and
flavors
for
the
style
overall
i
would
like
to
preface
by
saying
that
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
very
well
executed
in
terms
of
the
development
of
the
flavors
aroma
etc
however
the
combination
of
the
aromatic
citrusy
and
floral
hop
aromas
with
the
dark
malts
that
establish
the
black
ipa
classification
are
a
strange
combination
to
me
and
not
to
my
liking
the
least
desirable
part
of
the
beer
to
me
is
the
taste
where
the
hop
flavors
are
overpowered
by
the
maltiness
but
the
hop
flavor
does
not
pair
well
with
the
malts
overall
what
a
great
tasty
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavors
balanced
well
and
is
rather
easy
to
drink
for
being
near
10
alcohol
another
winner
hope
they
package
this
in
6
packs
will
drink
again
o
the
abv
is
incredibly
well
hidden
and
i
had
no
idea
this
beer
was
sitting
in
the
9
range
which
makes
it
dangerously
drinkable
speaking
of
which
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
and
i
didnt
enjoy
this
at
all
in
the
beginning
but
several
sips
in
it
started
to
grow
on
me
with
some
really
tasty
hop
resin
which
i
never
expected
i
purposely
avoided
this
one
in
the
box
of
hops
and
it
turned
out
to
be
way
better
than
i
anticipated
dont
care
for
the
aroma
but
the
taste
makes
up
for
it
m
round
medium
leading
to
fuller
side
o
not
a
bad
beer
just
nothing
outstanding
below
average
for
a
black
ipa
odive
grown
to
slowly
dislike
black
ipa
but
every
one
and
a
while
a

takes
a
pretty
sharp
take

beer
herbal

the
beer
really
works

flavor
brings
big

bitterness
hints
of
dark
chocolate
and

from
the

mild

accents
overall
you
have
to
think
of
one
of
the
andes

when
you
drink
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
moderate
natural
carbonation
slightly
oily
resinous

components
glide
across
the
palate
nice
dry
finish
keeps
this
beer
drinking
great
with
every
sip
i
need
some
more
of
this
stuff
o
a
good
black
ale
featuring
most
of
the
elements
common
to
the
style
but
augmented
by
a
dark
hop
bill
to
boot
poured
with
a
thick
billowy
beige
foam
with
nice
staying
power
foam
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
that
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
black
in
color
down
the
middle
with
dark
brown
shades
on
the
edges
dark
roasted

floral
and
light
citrus
aromas
with
occasional
pine

and
a
light
medicinal
bandaid
smell
at
the
back

with
assertive
but
delicate
carbonation
burnt

flavor
up

followed
by

into

bitterness
and
espresso
flavors
from
the
middle
to
the
end
finishes
with
a
lingering
pine
hop
and
charred
malt
bite
along
with
boozy
notes
as
this
warmed
up
not
quite
as
good
as
the
creeker
but
miles
better
than
the
abomination
that
was
double
zilla
overall
excellent
big
black
ipa
too
bad
this
one
isnt
regularly
brewed
overall
im
enjoying
this
beer
strong
yet
it
remains
easy
drinking
due
to
the
great
flavor
if
youre
a
fan
of
hops
seek
this
one
out
in
the
box
of
hops
this
is
a
typical
black
ipacascade
dark
ale
it
is
smooth
for
the
alcohol
percentage
but
it
is
not
hidden
very
well
was
expecting
a
little
more
balance
but
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
solid
imperial
black
ipa
its
wellcrafted
but
its
really
nothing
too
exciting
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
too
many
alcohol
notes
in
the
nose
and
flavors
but
once
again
its
not
hot
or
boozy
a
good
example
of
the
style
its
not
my
favorite
style
so
it
is
slightly
reflected
in
my
score
well
made
i
really
dig
this
fine
offering
from
the
gang
at
ithaca
oh
and
yes
there
will
be
lacing
while
the
beers
label
designation
as
an
ipa
is
warranted
its
taste
is
on
the
mild
side
of
the
genre
theres
a
certain
sweetness
at
its
center
with
an
appropriatethough
unchallengingbitter
finish
the
hops
are
there
but
comprise
a
sedate
dignified
presence
the
beers
texture
is
mellow
and
smooth
im
not
sure
what
ithaca
has
in
mind
for
its
box
of
hops
selections
but
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
mind
returning
to
tastes
at
first
strangely
hollow
the
dark
color
doesnt
seem
to
come
from
dark
malts
hops
are
exactly
where
i
want
them
though
so
the
next
sips
i
mash
around
in
my
mouth
more
before
swallowing
as
i
get
over
the
surprise
of
the
first
few
sips
i
start
to
find
the
missing
center
to
a
fine
dry
hoppy
mouthfeel
that
makes
my
mouth
water
after
each
swallow
the
only
piece
missing
to
this
great
puzzling
black
beer
is
a
bit
more
roasty
dark
malt
flavor
but
maybe
thats
just
a
problem
with
my
expectation
from
such
a
stoutlooking
brew
overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
black
ipa
slower
sipping
but
mildly
refreshing
defintely
worthy
of
a
try
what
would
be
nice
would
be
a
blend
of
flower
power
with
a
roasted
porter
thats
a
black
ipa
wasnt
super
impressed
but
really
liked
how
easy
this
was
to
drink
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
the
aroma
but
the
taste
and
drinkability
more
than
made
up
for
it
unlike
the
first
beer
i
had
from
the
box
of
hops
the
creeker
this
one
can
easily
be
a
one
and
done
brew
o
the
black
ipa
is
a
fantastic
winter
beer
to
those
who
cant
stomach
the
maltyspicy
offerings
usually
found
on
offer
in
the
darker
months
that
being
said
its
a
style
that
is
still
young
and
developing
constantly
this
particular
beer
could
be
a
fine
example
of
the
style
with
a
bit
of
tweaking
its
the
first
black
ipa
ive
tasted
from
ithaca
so
perhaps
theyre
still
experimenting
but
its
a
strong
start
to
an
exciting
style
overall
a
very
nice
cascadian
dark
ale
the
term
i
prefer
fresh
hop
flavors
blend
nicely
with
dark
malt
very
well
another
winner
from
the
box
of
hops
o
quite
good
though
a
bit
too
much
charash
to
meet
my
ideal
aba
this
one
came
so
close
to
a
stout
but
the
malt
stopped
just
short
of
heavy
enough
to
be
considered
a
stout
it
stayed
supple
and
smooth
even
amidst
all
the
taste
texture
of
the
roasted
qualities
you
might
never
guess
that
its
almost
10
abv
i
thought
this
ale
was
a
mess
it
looked
good
in
the
glass
and
that
was
about
it
medicinal
taste
offputting
and
i
really
like
black
ipas
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
pretty
good
aromas
mainly
hop
with
a
hint
of
malt
appearance
is
excellent
with
a
huge
long
lasting
tan
head
lots
of
lace
and
a
clear
dark
garnet
color
taste
is
similar
to
nose
good
balance
between
malt
sweet
hop
bitter
carbonic
tang
good
body
finish
falls
fast
at
first
and
then
tapers
very
slow
at

last
fairly
drinkable

wouldnt

the

and
a

head
colaish
scent
a
bit
dull
on

carries

across

and
leaves
a
malty
trail
down
the
back
of
the
pallet
as
it
deposits
slight
tones
of
tobacco
and
vanilla
not
all
its
hyped
to
be
but
would
order
one
at
a
bar
on
a
crisp
winter
evening
wow
this
looks
like
a
stout
but
is
all
west
coast
style
ipa
very
piney
aroma
folllows
into
the
flavor
with
a
mediumstrong
hippy
bitterness
that
is
very
refreshing
pleasantly
surprised
its
dark
to
malty
for
me
overall
a
pleasant
enough
ale
with
a
lot
going
for
it
at
the
start
it
finished
a
little
bitter
for
me
but
nothing
to
bad
not
my
favorite
but
a
solid
decent
ale
thoroughly
enjoyable
hybrid
ipa
id
definitely
buy
this
again
sometime
a
hoppy
refreshing
choice
thats
affordable
and
tasty
my
favorite
from
21
amendment
love
the
can
designusefulness
o
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
black
ipa
not
over
the
top
with
bitterness
or
hops
it
is
extremely
well
balanced
and
does
a
great
job
getting
the
most
out
of
both
malt
and
hops
a
nice
surprise
tastes
like
a
decent
ipa
not
to
smokey
or
black
qualities
more
delicious
than
i
remember
plenty
of
juicy
piney
hops
but
not
too
bitter
nice
smooth

backdrop
thats
moderately
dry
and
chocolatey
with
some

not
overly
roasty

the

normally
i
rate
appearance

taste
but
on
the
first
sip
i
was
struck
by
the
velvety
mouthfeel
i
really
like
this
beer
21st
amendment
puts
everything
you
need
on
the
can
then
they
put
everything
i
like
in
the
can
great
black
ipa
it
is
not
too
bitter
but
still
has
some
hoppiness
pours
a
nice
deep
chocolatereddish
brown
letting
a
little
light
in
barely
aroma
is
of
pine
resin
beautiful
taste
is
hops
some
citrus
and
bitterness
i
am
a
hop
fan
but
this
bitterness
is
kinda
weird
and
slightly
metallic
feels
ok
overall
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
it
just
dull
and
uninteresting
medium
body
and
carbonation
dries
out
on
the
finish
amazing
very
smooth
flavor
with
a
stout
like
finish
not
21st
amendments
best
beer
that
honor
goes
to
bitter
american
or
brew
free
or
die
but
its
still
tasty
i
always
liked
black
ipas
and
this
one
solidified
that
just
a
great
brew
straight
outta
the
can
is
quite
nice
good
amount
of
hop
flavor
65ibus
but
great
balance
this
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
black
ipas
youll
find
sits
light
on
the
stomach
and
goes
great
with
chicken
and
spicy
peppers
the
beer
sipper
o
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
21st
amendment
beers
a
nononsense
black
ipa
that
brings
the
hops
and
roast
right
into
the
forefront
but
even
on
a
hot
day
it
goes
down
nicely
the
fear
for
any
brewer
with
this
upandcoming
style
to
to
make
an
ipa
first
and
allow
the
dark
grain
to
complement
but
most
attempts
carelessly
revert
to
simply
a
hoppy
porter
riding
that
line
dangerously
close
back
in
black
edges
out
the
porter
and
sides
with
ipa
but
only
slightly
i
really
liked
this
one
and
this
style
can
be
somewhat
elusive
for
me
i
usually
find
that
the
stout
like
qualities
of
the
malt
clash
and
are
too
heavy
alongside
the
citrusy
ipa
flavors
not
so
in
this
beer
the
malt
is
as
light
as
it
could
possibly
be
and
still
be
roasted
almost
black
light
and
drinks
lightly
i
love
it
a
reasonably
well
made
black
ipa
a
mediumbodied
and
quite
flavorable
aba
smells
of
hops
and
slight
roasted
malt
tastes
pretty
much
like
the
aroma
a
little
bit
of
hops
up
front
with
some
nice
balance
from
the
roasted
malt
it
is
pretty
thin
and
easy
drinking
not
real
hoppy
and
not
a
ton
of
flavor
but
nicely
balanced
and
well
done
i
would
call
it
a
slightly
hoppy
light
bodied
schwartz
at
6
8
you
could
get
in
trouble
with
these
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
and
would
be
a
nice
offering
for
non
ipa
people
o
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
a
very
smooth
quaffable
brew
that
is
kind
of
true
to
the
style
which
i
consider
an
anti
ipa
style
like
hey
were
calling
this
ipa
but
really
is
a
hoppy
schwarz
regardless
i
like
it
pours
a
dark
clear
brown
with
a
light
tan
head
the
head
has
moderate
retention
but
leaves
some
soapy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
roasted
much
more
reminiscent
of
a
schwarzbier
with
only
a
hint
of
hops
its
a
nice
aroma
but
not
very
ipaish
the
taste
is
equally
close
to
a
schwarzbier
delicious
but
not
really
an
ipa
theres
a
nice
feel
to
the
body
and
its
nice
a
smooth
if
this
werent
billed
as
an
ipa
i
think
it
would
get
a
much
higher
rating
it
has
a
great
flavor
but
it
doesnt
even
closely
resemble
one
d
not
the
best
one
ive
had
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
o
i
dont
like
this
style
of
beer
in
most
situations
this
brew
is
no
exception
i
feel
that
it
brings
out
the
least
pleasant
characteristics
of
stouts
and
ipas
without
show
casing
eithers
redeeming
qualities
first
off
im
loving
this
trend
of
craft
beers
being
available
in
cans
but
as
for
this
black
ipa
its
pretty
darn
tasty
its
not
as
bitter
or
hoppy
as
other
ipas
i
have
had
but
still
has
good
flavor
theres
a
nice
malt
and
heaviness
to
the
beer
without
being
cloying
or
filling
nothing
particularly
outstanding
but
tasty
nonetheless
overall
a
well
done
solid
example
of
the
black
ale
style
can
poured
to
tall
glass
at
mustards
in
napa
valley
noticed
the
beer
was
canned
on
may
20
2013
and
i
had
it
march
5
2014
nice
restaurants
really
need
to
start
figuring
this
beer
things
out
not
really
acceptable
for
an
ipa
black
or
not
anyway
pours
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
little
purple
hue
small
off
white
head
smells
like
lemon
pinesol
and
some
sweet
chocolate
in
the
background
the
flavor
follows
the
aroma
rather
closely
with
much
more
malt
sweetness
chocolate
lemon
pine
old
hops
i
guess
medium
mouthfeel
a
bit
creamy
with
medium
level
carbonation
would
like
to
try
fresh
but
as
is
it
wasnt
bad
with
that
said
plenty
of
better
things
to
reach
for
i
had
this
on
tap
at
taco
mac
my
first
offering
from
these
guys
stronger
roasted
malt
flavor
than
im
accustomed
to
for
black
ipas
couldve
used
a
bit
more
hops
definitely
more
black
than
ipa
deep
brownish
black
color
as
youd
expect
lighter
head
than
id
have
expected
give
the
flavor
somewhat
flat
aroma
malty
and
hoppy
near
black
body
with
creamy
silky
beige
head
nice
dark
roast
grain
flavor
comes
through
to
accent
the
hops
elements
of
burnt
toast
wood
hops
add
more
bitterness
to
the
roast
flavor
but
still
smooth
on
the
finish
some
lingering
bitterness
on
the
palate
good
malty
and
balanced
black
ipa
probably
hoppier
than
it
feels
back
in
not
quite
black
dark
red
highlights
around
the
edges
decent
head
retention
with
larger
air
bubbles
suspended
some
roast
some
hop
citrus
in
the
aroma
but
not
much
else
kinda
generic
the
flavor
is
more
lively
but
still
muddled
again
the
citrusroast
thing
with
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
kinda
nice
o
not
the
best
of
the
style
and
given
how
good
the
brewery
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
someone
like
me
who
loves
the
style
recommended
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
balance
between
the
roasty
malts
and
hoppy
flavors
as
well
as
well
hidden
alcohol
another
nice
brew
from
21st
amendment
and
available
in
a
can
o
decent
black
ipa
could
back
down
from
the
bitterness
and
hopefully
remove
that
soapy
taste
but
id
have
this
one
again
though
theres
a
plethora
of
better
options
certainly
can
taste
the
bittering
hops
but
has
a
nice
malty
taste
to
it
almost
like
a
chocolatecoffee
taste
but
not
quite
there
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
would
recommend
it
smooth
12
oz
can
pours
brown
with
fluffy
beige
never
ending
head
aroma
is
of
citrusy
hops
toasted
malt
and
some
dark
fruit
body
is
full
and
tangy
taste
is
of
citrusy
hops
toffee
coffee
vanilla
and
dark
fruit
finish
is
medium
and
not
too
hoppy
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
after
this
brew
i
might
start
liking
it
a
solid
beer
one
of
my
favorite
easilyaccessible
black
ipas
overall
a
very
good
black
ipa
not
overly
malty
nor
sweet
the
roasted
malt
compliments
the
hops
quite
well
id
even
say
well
balanced
o
ive
had
this
a
few
times
without
reviewing
and
without
any
memorable
moments
but
this
time
revealed
a
decent
roast
maltheavy
black
ipa
if
you
lean
that
way
pleasant
drinker
for
me
d
this
is
one
of
those
black
ipas
that
drinks
more
like
a
hoppy
stout
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
roast
to
let
the
hops
play
the
part
tasty
none
the
less
with
good
flavor
and
balance
i
really
like
most
black
ipaa
and
black
on
black
is
a
great
black
ipa
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
leaves
a
decent
residue
overall
i
never
was
a
fan
of
black
ipas
until
this
one
had
almost
the
body
of
a
porter
and
was
so
drinkable
its
just
a
big
malt
like
coffee
bomb
and
then
hops
slide
by
in
the
end
for
a
mildly
bitter
and
smooth
finish
this
beer
is
sessionable
to
me
very
drinkable
i
loved
this
back
in
black
pours
a
black
color
with
a
frothy
large
and
lacing
head
there
is
a
tiny
metal
like
aroma
the
has
a
nice
burnt
like
malty
backbone
with
hints
of
a
floral
hop
near
the
end
body
is
a
bit
watery
but
flavors
are
present
overall
a
nice
mellow
and
drinkable
black
ale
o
good
beer
like
i
mentioned
before
i
am
getting
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
but
otherwise
this
is
a
good
beer
i
think
it
is
a
good
alternative
for
a
hop
head
that
likes
a
little
more
toasted
flavor
of
a
dark
malty
beer
for
a
change
this
offers
a
good
in
between
balance
i
would
buy
it
again
o
nice
offering
i
would
not
turn
one
of
these
down
o
a
very
enjoyable
ipa
that
is
unique
wonderful
flavor
would
say
that
it
could
be
a
little
more
bitter
overall
its
a
very
smooth
beer
with
a
knockout
flavor
would
def
pick
it
up
again
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
lasting
across
the
full
depth
of
the
tongue
a
bit
syrupy
and
fitting
for
a
heavier
ipa
that
makes
you
want
another
o
not
great
but
not
bad
by
any
means
its
a
satisfying
beer
if
you
come
across
some
however
there
are
many
other
beers
id
rather
buy
than
this
utterly
black
this
beer
is
presented
in
an
artistically
motifedd
black
can
the
aroma
is
grainy
and
a
little
smokey
charcoal
and
a
touch
of
wood
and
background
hops
the
taste
is
dry
with
a
heavily
roasted
and
almost
char
quality
full
in
body
easy
to
drink
and
moderately
full
of
flavor
like
a
highly
hopped
dry
stout
nice
overall
a
beer
that
tries
to
do
the
impossible
heavy
roast
and
lotta
hop
attack
succeeds
better
than
most
and
gotta
give
em
credit
like
strong
flavors
and
a
strong
herbal
dry
finish
this
is
your
brew
overall
very
piney
with
dark
roastiness
to
balance
a
creamy
mouthfeel
gives
this
beer
a
nice
texture
that
helps
to
curb
some
of
the
bitterness
strong
flavor
with
a
long
finish
that
leave
you
feeling
quite
satisfied
this
beer
would
be
great
with
smoked
pork
or
beef
im
surprised
this
rating
is
so
low
maybe
its
because
it
was
my
first
21a
beer
but
i
thought
it
was
great
i
rarely
write
full
reviews
but
i
felt
compelled
to
say
something
appearancearomataste
were
what
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
cascadian
dark
ale
it
was
a
little
too
smooth
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
notes
of
pine
oak
and
grapefruit
all
came
out
in
the
nose
and
taste
as
its
not
the
best
cda
ive
ever
had
its
far
from
the
worst
keep
up
the
good
work
21a
overall
decent
stab
at
the
style
when
in
sf
try
visiting
21st
amendment
o
enjoyable
black
ipa
still
trying
to
get
my
mind
around
a
dark
beer
that
isnt
a
stout
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
some
more
of
these
soon
a
fairly
executed
black
ipa
not
awesome
but
not
bad
i
could
throw
a
few
of
these
back
overall
not
the
most
exciting
beer
but
still
good
tasting
and
easy
to
drink
bold
in
style
and
really
well
made
www
brewreport
blogspot
com
overall
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
nothing
i
would
strongly
recommend
decent
over
time
my
opinion
of
this
brew
has
definitely
improved
im
about
half
way
through
as
i
rereview
parts
of
this
and
the
beer
is
probably
around
55
degrees
3
75
pours
a
nice
black
with
lots
if
brown
head
that
lingers
with
nice
lacing
smells
a
bit
of
burnt
chocolate
burnt
caramel
and
hop
resin
taste
isnt
bad
but
thin
and
not
too
compkex
slightly
too
malty
with
a
bitterness
that
hangs
around
for
too
long
this
is
a
uniquely
mellow
unexpectedly
drinkable
black
ipa
balancing
the
bitter
burnt
flavors
with
bitter
fruity
hop
flavors
is
always
a
challenge
this
beer
isnt
aggressive
in
either
regard
which
is
not
particularly
exciting
but
it
is
nicely
charming
i
would
think
that
this
would
be
at
least
scored
in
the
80s
i
think
there
are
better
ipas
but
then
again
is
this
just
an
ipa
o
this
was
a
really
good
black
ipa
nice
and
hoppy
but
balanced
nicely
by
the
malt
o
a
pleasant
beer
nothing
wrong
or
great
it
has
a
nice
aroma
and
the
flavor
is
a
good
combination
of
some
grapefruit
hops
quickly
overshadowed
by
malt
the
finish
is
bitter
and
dry
like
espresso
beans
it
works
well
with
a
beef
stock
based
soup
verdict
decent
at
best
it
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
good
black
ipa
but
the
balance
of
flavors
really
poor
and
the
malt
and
roast
really
dominate
what
could
be
a
nice
earthy
hop
forward
beer
definitely
not
the
best
example
when
rated
to
style
but
this
is
still
a
good
beer
with
a
decent
hop
profile
despite
muted
roasted
flavors
i
do
think
its
the
most
balanced
and
drinkable
offering
by
21st
amendment
that
ive
had
so
far
and
would
definitely
have
another
if
offered
one
im
still
on
the
road
to
finding
the
ultimate
black
ipas
however
so
it
may
be
later
than
sooner
drinkability
it
is
still
a
decent
brew
even
after
six
months
however
i
will
need
to
revisit
this
one
would
i
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
pretty
decent
dark
ale
with
a
heavy
hop
punch
interesting
flavor
balance
different
but
not
bad
not
always
a
big
fan
of
21st
a
but
this
one
is
worth
trying
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
doubt
i
will
be
picking
up
anymore
if
it
was
available
id
drink
it
id
even
recommend
it
to
a
friend
this
one
just
isnt
for
me
but
to
be
fair
it
has
a
tasty
quality
to
it
but
its
definitely
nothing
too
special
o
not
great
im
a
little
disappointed
it
was
canned
five
months
ago
so
not
at
the
peak
of
freshness
still
though
not
particularly
old
and
not
particularly
good
21st

black

is
black

it

dark

with
a

finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
bit
fizzy
and
a
little
thin
but
has
a
nice
finish
overall
a
solid
black
ipa
but
not
quite
up
there
with
sublimely
very
sessionable
though
had
on
tap
at
golden
west
in
baltimore
appearance
was
nothing
special
must
not
have
gotten
a
good
pour
out
of
the
tap
because
i
had
no
head
at
all
color
was
a
dark
dark
brown
with
hints
of
red
around
the
edges
slightest
touch
of
caramel
colored
suds
on
the
top
looks
like
a
stout
but
definitely
drinks
like
an
ipa
lots
of
rich
scents
on
the
nose
coffee
buttercream
chocolate
and
a
touch
of
smoke
the
taste
closely
mimics
the
nose
definitely
can
taste
the
hops
not
citrusy
but
robust
which
gives
me
the
impression
that
they
are
extremely
wellbalanced
with
the
grains
malty
character
but
not
too
sweet
toasty
and
roasty
dark
flavors
bittersweet
chocolate
and
toast
with
a
hint
of
strong
coffee
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
extremely
pleasant
not
too
crisp
but
not
as
flat
as
other
dark
beers
can
be
overall
an
extemely
tasty
beer
great
take
on
the
black
ipa
but
this
is
certainly
open
to
interpretation
some
my
call
it
a
stout
m
some
a
brown
ale
a
great
beer
to
kick
off
a
session
and
enjoy
when
the
weather
is
turning
from
cold
to
colder
cheers
pours
an
opaque
very
dark
brown
with
a
huge
fluffy
dark
taupe
head
average
head
retention
colaruby
glints
are
noted
around
the
bottom
edges
aroma
is
characterized
by
chocolate
roasted
malt
and
cherry
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
stout
style
but
they
call
this
a
black
ipa
in
which
case
it
is
more
true
to
style
carbonation
is
a
bit
on
the
low
average
side
very
mild
flavors
given
the
appearance
of
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
some
coffee
acidity
late
theres
a
mild
sweetness
throughout
some
of
its
hop
character
expresses
itself
about
midway
it
still
drinks
a
bit
more
like
an
english
stout
the
65
ibus
likely
put
it
in
an
ipa
category
otherwise
it
should
be
in
an
english
stout
category
im
a
pretty
big
fan
of
21st
amendment
in
general
but
back
in
black
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
they
put
out
black
as
night
is
a
pretty
adept
description
of
the
color
this
beer
takes
when
poured
into
a
glass
the
taste
is
both
smoky
and
bold
and
the
high
abv
will
have
you
feeling
these
pretty
quickly
highly
recommend
o
this
just
tastes
old
the
hops
have
faded
the
malt
feel
a
bit
plain
and
the
coffee
notes
are
stale
drink
tasty
but
not
in
the
top
tier
yet
of
the
black
ipas
glad
i
got
a
single
can
because
i
dont
think
i
want
6
cans
and
because
i
cant
get
this
in
so
cal
o
this
beer
is
only
ok
i
can
tell
mine
isnt
fresh
and
i
think
that
may
have
a
lot
to
do
with
it
this
brew
poured
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
tan
head
it
looks
almost
exactly
like
a
stout
the
body
was
a
dark
brown
almost
black
as
a
result
there
is
no
visible
carbonation
the
head
takes
awhile
to
dissipate
and
leaves
significant
lacing
on
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
hint
of
smoke
or
toastiness
maybe
a
little
nuttiness
and
some
hops
this
is
different
from
a
normal
ipa
there
is
definite
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
taste
but
there
is
almost
a
roasted
nutty
taste
to
it
this
isnt
what
i
expected
at
all
but
then
again
i
never
had
a
black
ipa
the
finish
lingers
with
a
lot
of
nuttiness
moreso
than
the
hops
i
would
have
this
again
probably
after
i
had
another
black
ipa
to
compare
it
to
overall
personally
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
session
beer
while
dark
in
nature
it
is
not
heavy
whatsoever
and
maltshops
accentuate
each
other
very
well
nothing
too
fancy
but
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
i
was
happy
to
try
this
as
black
ipas
seem
to
be
a
bit
hard
to
find
in
my
area
this
one
had
a
very
prominent
malt
taste
to
it
overall
it
was
good
but
average
in
every
aspect
this
would
be
good
as
a
beginners
black
ipa
probably
wouldnt
chase
this
one
down
again
o
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
as
it
was
enjoyable
without
requiring
too
much
thought
and
sometimes
thats
exactly
what
i
want
however
it
cost
ten
bucks
a
six
pack
and
at
that
price
i
want
something
earth
shattering
and
that
this
is
not
but
if
you
threw
a
can
at
me
i
would
gratefully
drink
it
o
me
likey
solid
complex
without
being
complicated
or
straying
from
the
style
back
in
black
pours
a
deep
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
mocha
head
the
aroma
is
excellent
its
got
a
big
amount
of
piney
hops
over
roasted
malts
the
taste
follows
the
nose
striking
the
formula
for
a
black
ipa
right
on
the
nose
piney
hops
roasty
malts
thats
all
you
need
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
great
its
not
particularly
jawdropping
but
a
perfectly
tasty
beer
it
gets
the
balance
just
right
overall
without
a
strong
hop
profile
this
beer
doesnt
come
near
what
i
am
looking
for
in
an
aba
particularly
since
i
didnt
particularly
like
the
indistinctly
flavored
malt
bill
either
o
low
end
of
the
hop
spectrum
for
the
style
but
still
a
great
offering
o
i
like
this
beer
less
and
less
the
more
i
have
it
final
thoughts
an
upgrade
from
their
ipa
but
could
use
some
work
in
the
hop
department
either
use
some
different
kinds
or
tone
it
down
and
just
make
a
great
porter
it
seemed
like
every
time
i
took
a
sip
the
sweet
aroma
stopped
me
from
completely
enjoying
it
its
pretty
good
above
average
nice
mix
of
bitter
and
a
slightly
bread
or
chocolate
taste
it
pours
dark
but
not
black
is
medium
in
feel
and
leaves
a
decent
lasting
lattice
it
tastes
like
a
session
beer
but
the
low
alcohol
content
leads
to
quicker
enjoyment
i
like
the
roasted
taste
of
this
one
mouthfeel
surprisingly
soft
and
ipa
like
feel
really
was
mind
boggling
given
the
texture
of
the
head
and
very
dark
appearance
again
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
makes
the
feel
pop
but
overall
the
flow
is
smooth
and
almost
creamy
with
an
subtle
ipa
like

excited
to
try
this
beer
and
out
of
the
gate
it
looks
promising
with
a
opaque
black
appearance
and
strong
head
aroma
is
of
vending
machine
hot
chocolate
with
almost
no
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
not
heavy
refreshing
for
a
dark
beer
overall
disappointing
brew
all
around
sorry
21st
amendment
probably
wont
try
others
from
you
line
cheers
21st
amendments
back
in
black
is
not
a
raucous
rowdy
rockandrollin
roofraiser
that
would
do
the
acdc
song
of
the
same
name
proud
its
a
black
ipa
that
is
a
little
bit
too
fruit
juicy
to
compete
with
the
best
versions
of
this
style
d
this
is
solid
but
not
great
this
doesnt
measure
up
to
others
in
the
style
however
it
is
a
pleasantly
sessionable
take
on
the
style
so
it
has
that
going
for
itself
i
do
like
it
but
think
it
is
a
bit
odd
for
a
black
ipa
a
good
burger
with
lots
of
fresh
toppings
will
compensate
for
the
oddness
for
a
beer
i
was
so
excited
to
try
and
such
a
beauty
to
look
at
this
beer
is
pretty
disappointing
in
comparison
to
other
ibas
ive
had
i
have
to
rate
this
at
the
midbottom
overall
it
was
an
ok
black
ipa
a
better
mouthfeel
and
working
on
that
nuttiness
with
some
more
chocolate
would
have
helped
out
a
lot
highly
drinkable
i
enjoyed
this
beer
more
than
i
thought
i
would
again
not
bad
overall
but
there
are
definitely
bad
parts
in
there
the
smell
was
so
great
i
thought
id
be
in
for
something
exceptional
but
that
harsh
roast
just
took
hold
would
not
let
go
i
have
to
say
i
might
try
this
again
just
to
get
that
smell
but
i
might
be
welladvised
to
split
it
with
someone
this
beer
is
an
interesting
experiment
but
for
me
theres
too
much
of
a
malt
presence
for
it
to
be
a
good
hop
based
beeripa
cascade
dark
ale
black
ipa
american
dark
ale
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
and
too
hoppy
to
be
a
malt
based
beer
its
not
bad
really
just
kind
of
all
over
the
place
with
its
flavor
profile
big
fan
of
the
back
in
black
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
21st
amendment
i
prefer
this
black
ipa
to
both
the
sublimely
selfrighteous
from
stone
and
the
imperial
iniquity
from
southern
tier
the
nose
on
the
back
in
black
is
superb
hops
hit
you
quick
and
the
tast
and
mouthfeel
are
malty
and
full
of
smoke
great
can
as
well
would
like
to
rereview
fresh
on
tap
until
then
this
was
pretty
bad
d
i
wish
i
really
liked
this
beer
since
i
am
being
a
big
fan
of
the
black
ipa
style
but
this
just
didnt
live
up
to
my
standards
or
any
of
the
other
bipas
that
i
had
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
d
this
beer
presents
an
array
of
flavors
for
the
drinker
to
sort
through
with
the
hope
that
they
will
find
one
that
they
like
the
end
result
is
not
necessarily
an
extreme
version
of
the
style
but
just
one
that
struggles
to
be
successful
malt
and
yeast
qualities
seem
the
most
offcenter
being
a
bit
too
smoky
but
also
bordering
on
being
indicative
of
autolysis
flavors
are
best
early
when
citrusy
aromatics
fill
the
senses
aside
the
smoky
malt
reminiscent
of
pizza
ports
warrior
black
ipa
although
not
as
smoothly
maltforward
as
that
other
beer
i
really
like
the
can
too
pretty
cool
easy
drinking
beer
not
too
far
to
one
extreme
or
the
other
had
this
my
last
trip
down
to
maryland
havent
seen
it
around
ct
yet
really
liking
this
new
hybrid
style
the
hoppiness
of
ipas
combined
with
tasty
dark
malts
pours
a
deep
mahogany
color
nice
cream
colored
fluffy
head
do
it
nice
roasty
aroma
taste
is
bitter
and
hoppy
but
nicely
balanced
by
some
caramel
tasting
malts
great
beer
would
definitely
purchase
again
and
hope
this
style
keeps
growing
and
growing
this
is
a
newer
style
but
based
on
what
i
have
sampled
this
seems
to
miss
the
mark
for
the
style
with
more
roasted
malt
than
i
care
for
and
less
of
the
earthy
or
floral
hops
i
am
accustomed
to
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
examples
you
know
a
beer
style
has
made
it
when
it
has
been
canned
this
beer
has
excellent
lacing
but
is
not
as
black
as
expected
it
has
a
sweet
hoppy
resin
and
malt
sweetness
in
the
nose
its
very
smooth
with
a
faint
roasted
maltiness
and
some
char
when
the
beer
lingers
on
the
palate
the
hops
are
doing
their
job
but
the
malt
just
lets
go
this
brew
has
a
semidry
finish
with
some
faint
roast
and
hop
bitterness
flavors
to
deal
with
it
seems
a
bit
confused
perhaps
the
contract
brewer
lost
touch
with
the
end
goal
here
its
decent
at
best
though
a
good
pick
if
cans
are
your
only
option
a
friend
got
this
from
his
local
place
in
boonton
and
recommended
it
so
i
tried
one
of
his
like
it
says
it
is
a
black
ipa
that
pours
like
a
normal
ipa
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
the
hoppy
notes
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
which
was
a
nice
surprise
considering
the
appearance
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
a
highly
recommended
ipa
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
something
slightly
different
and
a
little
harder
to
find
its
one
of
only
a
few
black
ipas
ive
had
but
i
would
definitely
get
it
again
i
got
a
single
at
beer
run
in
charlottesville
va
but
wish
i
had
got
a
six
pack
i
havent
seen
too
many
black
ipas
around
but
try
to
get
one
whenever
i
see
it
go
get
some
overall
this
is
not
exactly
an
amazing
black
ipa
but
definitely
a
drinkable
brew
d
a
very
nice
ipa
thats
incredibly
easy
to
put
down
thumbs
up
d
i
never
wouldve
guessed
this
was
right
around
7
pretty
good
beer
i
could
probably
have
a
second
one
of
these
but
might
stop
there
the
roastiness
is
a
bit
much
for
a
few
ipas
good
beer
thats
out
of
a
can
love
that
unexpectedness
love
it
when
craft
breweries
do
that
enjoyed
in
the
company
of
mikesgroove
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
massively
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
nice
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
slight
bitter
hop
and
cream
the
flavor
was
of
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
slight
bitter
hop
and
cream
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
nice
brew
it
was
not
aweinspiring
by
any
means
but
still
good
if
this
one
had
a
little
bit
more
of
a
hop
profile
going
on
it
would
have
been
quite
good
as
it
was
more
toward
the
roasted
side
of
things
for
the
most
part
a
must
try
black
ipa
first
off
the
label
on
this
beer
is
super
fucking
awesome
dare
i
say
epic
yes
pours
a
deep
near
dark
brown
huge
tan
head
pretty
fizzy
at
least
it
sounds
fizzy
looks
good
but
not
quite
black
pretty
interesting
aroma
very
sour
smelling
not
citrus
like
youd
think
of
most
hoppy
beers
it
doesnt
smell
like
a
wild
ale
this
is
a
different
kind
of
sour
smells
almost
like
lemon
rinds
theres
a
kind
of
dark
malt
thing
in
there
but
not
really
the
overall
aroma
seems
complex
but
pretty
hard
to
pick
apart
first
sip
is
a
doozey
the
dark
malt
and
hops
come
at
you
simultaneously
they
create
their
own
flavor
its
kind
of
an
earthy
pine
offcitrus
flavor
at
first
it
hits
you
and
you
think
youre
drinking
something
thats
suppose
to
be
kind
of
sour
but
then
you
realize
its
the
hops
then
the
hops
and
malt
coalesce
to
create
a
truly
unique
flavor
combination
that
ive
never
tasted
before
at
some
points
it
aint
bad
but
other
times
i
dont
even
want
it
the
finish
gives
off
a
strong
lemon
juice
flavor
this
beer
is
certainly
a
good
test
for
the
pallet
and
definitely
a
unique
experience
it
is
however
probably
not
the
best
choice
for
a
go
to
casual
beer
d
one
of
the
easiestdrinking
cdas
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
and
even
though
some
may
want
more
roasted
or
bitter
tones
it
was
one
of
the
best
canned
beers
i
have
ever
had
overall
an
ok
black
ipa
a
better
mouthfeel
and
replacing
the
nuttiness
with
some
chocolate
and
more
roasted
coffee
would
have
helped
things
a
lot
on
tap
at
the
21st
amendment

of

good
blend
of

and
sweetness
of

in
the
flavour
creamy
mouthfeel
certainly
one
of
the
better
cdas
ive
had
i
would
really
like
to
dry
this
from
the
tap
in
sf
to
see
if
those
odd
flavors
are
always
present
something
tells
me
this
one
got
a
little
lost
in
translation
on
its
way
to
the
contract
brewers
cannery
big
thanks
to
santa
adam
for
sending
along
this
treat
i
poured
the
can
into
a
sam
adams
pint
glass
and
was
greeted
with
a
good
two
finger
worth
of
tan
colored
head
on
top
of
a
nice
brownish
black
colored
bodied
brew
the
aroma
of
fresh
hops
filled
my
nostrils
i
also
got
a
good
amount
coffee
and
a
light
touch
of
chocolate
the
flavors
mimicked
the
nose
it
was
hop
forward
with
a
little
bit
of
roast
coming
thru
as
well
it
had
a
medium
feel
to
it
with
ample
carbonation
i
think
i
liked
sublimely
selfrighteous
a
little
more
than
this
one
but
i
would
drink
it
again
easy
sipper
in
cans
and
solid
addition
to
the
style
ddrinkabiity
is
high
but
the
mouth
is
a
little
watery
and
the
falvor
profile
is
a
little
underwhelming
there
is
nice
balance
in
this
beer
i
like
the
mix
of
chocolate
malts
and
lots
of
hops
the
style
is
interesting
visually
ironic
back
in
black
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
that
has
some
interesting
characteristics
within
the
can
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
and
it
goes
down
with
a
bitterenss
that
is
not
too
crazy
there
is
a
nice
drinkable
feel
since
there
is
a
leash
on
the
ibus
a
great
representation
of
this
style
a
hoppy
porterblack
ipa
as
to
drinkability
i
think
its
quite
accessible
if
youve
enjoyed
a
strong
porter
and
you
enjoy
hops
this
has
got
you
covered
it
could
probably
be
more
focused
but
its
still
very
nicely
done
drinkability
if
i
was
blindfolded
i
might
just
think
this
was
a
standard
ipa
and
might
fool
myself
into
thinking
the
light
coffee
and
roasted
profile
wasnt
really
there
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
too
bitter
considering
the
lack
of
roasted
flavor
even
the
actual
hop
flavor
seems
secondary
to
the
bitterness
21st
a
please
check
out
that
strange
taste
drinkers
enjoy
with
the
above
proviso
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
this
goes
down
easy
with
no
hint
of
the
higher
than
average
abv
which
keeps
the
drinkability
high
finally
a
beer
from
21st
amendment
id
come
back
to
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
isnt
too
far
off
from
being
something
really
special
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
that
nose
set
me
up
just
for
the
palate
to
completely
miss
the
mark
a
shame
a
pleasant
surprise
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
really
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
night
nothing
extraordinary
just
a
well
made
beer
that
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
if
the
nose
didnt
have
the
soapy
smell
i
think
it
would
work
a
lot
better
for
me
serving
type
can
drink
ive
gone
back
for
seconds
and
thirds
since
the
review
i
recommend
grabbing
a
sixer
theyll
disappear
d
not
too
bad
just
a
bit
more
hops
and
it
would
be
much
better
i
could
drink
this
one
again
with
no
problems
cheers
shawn
beer
had
promise
coming
out
of
the
can
but
fell
on
its
face
when
it
hit
the
palate
a
lot
more
black
than
ipa
as
much
hoppy
porter
as
black
ipa
worth
a
try
but
not
a
big
wow
update
i
had
this
on
tap
and
is
much
better
just
stay
clear
of
the
cans
d
interesting
brew
i
like
the
hops
upfront
with
a
nice
sweet
finish
md
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
reflects
the
flavor
i
was
expecting
much
more
from
this
brewery
ive
heard
so
much
about
and
a
beer
with
a
kick
ass
name
i
hope
i
either
got
a
bad
batch
or
an
old
showing
because
this
is
one
of
the
least
impressive
black
ipas
ive
ever
experienced
music
mindfunk
self
titled
debut
overall
swing
and
a
miss
this
beer
wants
to
be
great
and
i
like
it
on
uniqueness
it
just
misses
the
mark
on
taste
something
about
it
just
doesnt
translate
its
a
nice
brew
but
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
this
one
falls
flat
in
a
number
of
areas
and
while
it
still
yields
a
nice
package
its
far
from
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
i
had
to
review
a
beer
named
after
my
favorite
acdc
album
and
while
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
pretty
underwhelming
taste
is
a
bit
on
the
quiet
side
and
while
im
not
a
big
fan
of
big
hops
and
bitterness
this
definitely
could
have
done
well
with
a
bit
more
character
to
it
drinkability
is
moderate
something
about
this
one
leaves
me
ready
for
a
change
after
one
or
two
d
probably
wouldnt
drink
this
a
ton
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
d
i
honestly
could
finish
the
entire
6er
in
one
sitting
good
thing
i
didnt
d
like
i
said
i
remember
liking
it
okay
when
i
had
it
on
tap
a
while
ago
but
this
was
muddled
and
a
mess
too
bad
since
i
like
their
ipa
a
lot
d
not
exactly
what
you
think
of
in
terms
of
the
black
ipa
but
still
a
good
beer
overall
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
ipas
yet
i
am
absolutely
blown
away
by
the
appearance
and
flavors
of
this
beer
additionally
this
is
the
first
canned
beer
that
i
have
been
drawn
to
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
i
definitely
need
to
seek
out
more
beers
by
this
brewery
i
would
also
like
to
add
that
this
brewery
is
wonderfully
creative
with
their
can
designs
as
well
as
the
box
that
this
6er
came
in
d
excuse
me
sir
but
can
i
have
another
loved
it
and
could
drking
all
night
pours
a
blackish
body
with
good
head
that
receeds
on
the
quick
and
leaves
lace
patches
down
glass
a
mix
of
citric
hops
and
some
roasted
malts
hint
of
sweetness
nothing
stands
out
a
little
sticky
w
a
mediumtoheavy
body
and
the
roasted
malts
are
prevelant
as
beer
has
a
dryish
edge
soapy
citric
hops
w
a
little
spice
perk
up
and
poke
on
the
tongue
for
some
good
ol
ipa
hops
taste
the
balance
is
ok
but
not
perfect
as
i
find
the
hops
are
muddled
and
not
much
sweet
malt
just
dry
and
touch
of
blandness
as
i
drink
this
is
a
good
beer
but
a
tad
funky
aftertaste
and
overall
w
beer
im
just
left
with
an
alright
feeling
this
is
very
drinkable
and
rather
tasty
too
the
creaminess
of
the
very
long
lasting
head
adds
a
very
pleasing
quality
sampled
this
one
not
too
long
ago
at
the
blind
tiger
nyc
poured
black
with
less
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
average
retention
and
lacing
and
modestly
visible
carbonation
smelled
of
citrus
hops
piney
and
bitter
peel
though
not
overly
pungent
the
taste
was
surprisingly
thin
in
flavor
starting
on
a
citrus
note
and
then
devolving
to
a
thin
modestly
dry
finish
very
thin
texture
in
general
too
with
a
hint
of
carbonation
aside
from
the
wellhidden
nature
of
the
alcohol
content
i
found
this
to
be
a
lackluster
example
of
the
style
d
a
good
beer
from
21st
ammendment
very
refreshing
and
very
well
balanced
as
well
body
is
nice
and
creamy
with
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
an
enjoyable
beer
for
sure
but
maybe
just
not
up
to
the
spec
of
a
cascadian
dark
ale
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
well
balanced
and
certainly
full
bodied
this
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
in
my
opinion
what
these
beers
are
supposed
to
consist
of
a
full
well
balanced
flavor
that
maintains
strong
aspects
of
both
the
hop
and
malts
this
beer
equally
has
very
good
drinkability
could
easily
be
a
year
round
beer
for
all
occasions
d
a
decent
enough
beer
but
the
nose
was
a
mess
the
taste
was
decent
and
the
citrus
in
it
was
nice
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
though
i
have
only
had
a
few
black
ipas
before
but
i
think
this
one
really
nails
the
style
a
perfect
balance
of
roasted
malt
and
bitter
american
citrus
hops
im
still
thrown
back
and
forth
since
this
is
a
new
style
but
i
can
dig
it
a
reference
to
that
fact
that
im
watching
the
warriors
right
now
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
most
enjoyable
beer
it
brings
a
new
perspective
to
how
widely
variable
a
style
of
beer
can
be
and
offers
to
blur
the
stylistic
lines
even
more
if
i
were
to
describe
this
in
terms
of
style
i
would
say
that
its
80
citrusy
ipa
blended
with
20
english
porter
thanks
again
bj
12
oz

2

pours
extremely
dark
brown
healthy
white
brown
head
but
quickly
dissipating
coffee
toffee
and
american
hop
smell
roasted
malt
taste
balanced
well
by
those
wonderful
citrusy
hops
neither
the
hops
nor
the
roast
of
the
malt
is
too
bitter
its
made
even
more
drinkable
by
a
slight
appealing
sourness
definitely
true
to
its
label
good
job
notes
a
really
solid
brew
its
got
a
great
balance
between
the
hops
and
the
roasted
malts
that
shows
they
really
know
what
theyre
doing
nothing
was
ever
overpowering
d
it
was
ok
but
im
glad
i
only
got
a
single
i
havent
tasted
very
many
black
ipas
this
seemed
a
little
lite
on
the
hops
and
a
would
almost
classif
this
beer
as
a
weak
stout
tastes
darker
than
the
smell
the
hop
is
milder
than
most
ipas
but
the
combination
is
appealing
the
body
is
thinnish
the
carbonation
is
good
this
ale
at
first
drank
like
a
mix
between
a
porter
and
an
ipa
or
a
hoppy
porter
id
say
this
one
worked
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
i
suppose
it
is
the
pour
left
a
rather
magnanimous
2
inch
head
khakicolored
breaking
up
in
a
most
unique
way
from
within
leaving
a
dense
spiderweb
formation
and
somewhat
generous
lacing
the
liquid
shows
dark
brown
initially
but
later
reveals
a
deep
ruby
color
very
porteresque
qualities
burst
forth
in
the
aroma
mild
sourness
light
acidic
pungency
the
hops
start
to
come
through
after
a
minute
or
so
piney
and
flowery
a
strange
contrast
against
the
slowly
increasing
rounded
bitter
roast
aromas
emanating
with
time
that
notquitesharp
sour
bite
maintains
a
lead
role
in
the
taste
throughout
poking
out
through
a
thin
depthdeprived
porter
flavor
a
porter
profile
which
reminded
me
of
yuengling
porter
which
i
dig
an
intriguing
fruitiness
and
belgian
dubbel
characteristics
show
up
after
about
5
minutes
and
fill
in
nicely
what
starts
off
as
a
fairly
tasty
yet
somewhat
twodimensional
beer
it
drinks
equal
parts
lightsmooth
and
biting
and
the
fruitiness
lingers
for
quite
sometime
overall
worth
trying
not
sure
if
id
session
this
however
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
creamy
will
definitely
drink
this
baby
again
gets
better
as
it
warms
this
is
an
interesting
version
of
a
black
ipa
lots
of
hops
that
are
balanced
by
a
fair
amount
of
malt
its
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
all
in
all
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
would
have
liked
to
see
some
more
chocolate
and
creamy
smoothness
out
of
it
though
or
maybe
just
more
hops
this
was
a
tough
one
to
put
the
numbers
to
may
need
to
tweek
them
if
needed
as
i
drink
more
of
it
this
beer
is
interesting
upfront
it
tastes
like
a
porter
i
get
the
coffee
bittersweet
chocolate
and
a
slight
burnt
toast
flavor
the
back
is
a
slight
bitter
finish
i
suppose
thats
the
ipa
finish
i
think
i
would
not
call
this
a
black
ipa
the
hops
besides
the
bitter
finish
just
arent
there
for
me
the
grade
is
probably
too
high
for
thus
style
but
i
happen
to
like
porters
so
it
was
still
ok
with
me
d
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
on
the
other
hand
if
it
was
present
in
someones
fridge
and
the
only
other
offering
was
fizzy
yellow
i
would
choose
black
i
think
this
beer
is
a
great
effort
from
21st
amendment
and
i
look
forward
to
seeing
how
this
style
continues
to
develop
this
one
can
be
enjoyed
as
a
sessional
and
equally
as
much
in
almost
any
climatetemperature
situation
if
they
could
get
rid
of
the
dish
soap
notes
this
beer
would
be
outstanding
still
an
enjoyable
brew
only
the
second
one
that
i
can
say
that
about
for
21st
something
is
just
off
in
most
of
their
beers
not
sure
if
its
because
of
where
its
contract
brewed
or
what
give
this
one
a
shot
though
dark
chocolate
ruby
body
tight
froth
chocolate
brown

nice
retention
and
lace
properties
nice
mix
of
chocolate
malts
and
vibrant
citric
hops
very
nice
aroma
flavor
is
solid
but
would
better
with
even
a
bigger
hop
presence
and
bite
the
chocolate
roasted
malt
flavor
wins
the
battle
in
this
beer
with
the
piney
citric
hops
coming
in
second
even
keeled
mouthfeel
moderately
carbonated
and
medium
full
body
enjoyable
overall
impression
the
taste
that
washes
back
of
the
palate
lingers
and
lingers
very
intense
hops
characteristics
and
the
complex
malts
will
lead
me
to
be
intrigued
of
what
else
that
they
have
brewed
i
cant
wait
to
try
what
other
treats
that
they
have
linger
4
earlier
this
year
i
tasted
a
caserne
30
a
goldcolored
smoked
ald
at
brasserie
dieu
du
ciel
in
montreal
it
was
a
sensory
mixed
message
in
terms
of
what
a
pale
beer
should
taste
like
and
i
found
it
unpleasant
and
relatively
difficult
to
drink
conversely
the
black
ipa
penombre
at
the
same
establishment
was
surprisingly
tasty
and
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
black
ipa
from
21st
amendmentin
spite
of
the
mixed
messages
of
taste
and
color
and
i
figured
the
can
would
be
a
big
help
for
freshness
the
beer
poured
a
rich
brown
to
black
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
tan
head
and
nice
lacing
throughout
initial
stoutlike
roasted
malt
in
the
nose
but
the
hops
were
immediately
evident
in
the
first
taste
unlike
the
belgian
penombre
and
its
distinct
hop
bitterness
however
the
hops
here
were
a
tad
more
fruity
and
bright
coupled
with
the
rich
roasted
flavor
of
the
beer
it
tasted
a
bit
sour
and
a
couple
of
times
i
checked
the
can
to
see
if
perhaps
it
was
outdated
i
definitely
see
the
attraction
and
i
did
enjoy
the
drink
but
it
wasnt
quite
up
to
my
expectations
thus
the
less
than
perfect
rating
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
find
that
i
am
enjoying
this
emerging
style
this
is
a
very
good
example
it
is
great
to
see
the
packaging
cans
make
more
sense
than
bottles
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
the
flavor
and
scent
could
have
been
stronger
but
it
was
well
balanced
and
very
drinkable
d
a
decent
brew
but
not
a
standout
for
me
pretty
average
beer
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
nothing
really
wrong
with
it
either
just
average
the
palate
opens
with
a
rather
big
roasted
malt
bitterness
with
char
bitter
chocolate
and
then
followed
by
some
simpler
sweetness
almost
like
caramel
and
sugar
the
hops
are
secondary
here
a
little
pine
and
some
bitterness
both
of
which
are
overshadowed
by
the
malt
character
a
little
fruity
in
the
midpalate
before
a
long
finish
with
a
roasted
bitterness
and
a
mild
creaminess
medium
in
body
the
midpalate
is
rather
watery
and
the
creaminess
makes
this
feel
like
its
on
nitro
solid
stuff
this
really
is
more
of
a
stout
than
a
black
ipa
the
big
difference
is
the
sweetness
thats
mildly
pale
malt
like
d
pretty
interesting
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
but
its
not
something
i
would
seek
out
or
even
choose
at
a
store
the
body
was
typical
for
this
new
style
cascadia
dark
aleblack
ipa
not
really
thin
or
full
and
much
like
most
ipas
drinkability
was
ok
but
not
special
overall
a
decent
but
not
noticeable
take
on
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
black
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
at
more
than
half
way
gone
still
has
a
bit
of
head
well
laced
aroma
is
a
bit
of
pine
taste
is
fruity
piney
hops
with
plenty
of
malt
backing
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
coffee
or
roasted
malts
but
not
a
lot
mouthfeel
is
right
on
the
money
for
an
ipa
nice
dry
bitter
finish
falls
toward
the
middle
of
the
cascadian
ipa
spectrum
awesome
for
a
canned
beer
drinkability
a
well
balanced
dark
ipa
not
feeling
any
of
the
21st
amendment
beers
ive
had
so
far
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
ipa
nothing
outstanding
but
still
very
solid
allround
this
is
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
drinking
again
and
would
recommend
to
others
readily
d
this
was
my
first
black
ipa
and
i
was
very
impressed
i
found
it
to
be
quite
drinkable
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
and
i
look
forward
to
exploring
others
in
this
style
drinkability
not
too
fond
of
the
grass
notes
or
the
high
carbonation
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
dm
my
eyes
say
porter
but
my
head
says
ipa
this
is
just
a
cool
beer
style
overall
very
innovative
and
brings
some
great
crisp
flavors
together
that
i
wouldnt
have
expected
i
highly
recommend
this
for
someone
who
has
not
tried
the
style
thin
watery
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
spicy
hops
continue
their
theme
in
the
taste
malts
are
crisp
and
lightly
chocolatecoated
but
the
finish
has
a
hint
of
metallic
copper
and
other
mineral
notes
still
the
tight
carbonation
and
creamy
mouthfeel
are
a
delight
as
back
in
black
tacks
on
a
snappy
zest
as
the
hoppiness
lingers
after
each
sip
all
in
all
a
very
solid
black
ipa
that
drinks
easily
for
the
style
the
mineral
note
is
a
bit
of
a
distraction
but
everything
else
melds
harmoniously
recommended
d
this
was
a
nice
black
ipa
the
nose
was
very
hop
forward
but
the
flavors
were
malt
forward
with
a
nice
hop
finish
i
would
drink
this
again
future
outlook
an
interesting
beer
a
pretty
decent
experience
but
probably
not
one
that
has
moved
me
to
buy
again
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
a
decent
enough
effort
worth
checking
out
d
drinkable
black
ipas
are
somewhat
new
to
me
dont
know
if
it
is
one
of
my
preferred
styles
as
for
this
beer
it
is
pretty
good
nothing
exceptional
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
department
but
good
skål
d
a
good
beer
though
not
the
best
too
heavy
on
the
roasted
malts
for
my
preference
but
the
lightness
of
the
beer
does
lend
to
an
easier
drinkability
overall
mind
bender
of
a
beer
because
it
feels
like
an
ipa
with
little
other
than
color
contribution
from
the
dark
specialty
malt
i
expected
a
lot
more
malt
complexitybody
out
of
this
just
eyeing
it
up
well
done
black
ipa
and
quite
fun
to
drink
poured
from
a
can
into
a
pint
glass
beautiful
thick
head
that
just
creeps
towards
the
top
of
the
glass
this
has
a
real
nice
dark
brown
almost
black
color
a
great
blend
of
stoutiness
and
ipa
smells
very
floral
with
a
chocolatey
feel
tastes
like
caramel
and
grass
interestingly
enough
an
amazing
combination
the
only
thing
that
this
beer
really
loses
points
on
is
that
i
can
still
kind
of
taste
can
i
could
drink
this
beer
forever
and
it
is
quite
cheap
21st
amendment
back
in
black
is
a
clear
dim
redbrownblack
ale
with
a
dense
khaki
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
fruity
and
roasty
aroma
its
pretty
light
bodied
a
little
watery
and
metallic
with
a
pretty
clean
finish
its
quite
bitter
and
dry
sharp
and
green
its
not
very
well
balanced
and
not
good
for
more
than
a
pint
hopefully
the
new
brewer
can
put
his
stamp
on
this
one
or
maybe
this
is
his
nearly
black
in
color
with
a
deep
brown
hue
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
pours
with
a
thick
beige
head
that
leaves
lots
of
wet
sticky
lacings
on
the
glass
looks
like
it
would
be
thick
and
chewy
but
is
surprisingly
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
roasted
malt
and
coffee
aromas
with
a
faint
hint
of
citrus
and
dark
fruit
flavors
are
similar
to
aromas
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
in
the
front
a
bit
of
tangy
citrus
in
the
middle
and
a
dry
finish
with
a
slight
piney
hop
finish
pretty
unique
combination
of
flavors
although
i
enjoyed
it
i
probably
wouldnt
be
having
3
or
4
of
these
at
one
sitting
d
medium
to
low
the
abv
coupled
with
the
palate
confusion
makes
me
think
again
drinkability
a
mild
black
ipa
thats
unassuming
finishes
clean
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
drink
slowly
just
to
appreciate
all
that
is
going
on
the
india
black
ale
is
still
a
young
style
and
the
different
interpretations
i
have
had
are
all
quite
different
but
one
thing
is
for
sure
this
is
one
of
the
better
examples
i
have
tried
thus
far
this
is
my
third
can
of
this
in
as
many
days
and
the
first
time
i
wasnt
totally
feeling
it
the
second
goaround
i
started
feeling
more
clued
in
to
its
secrets
and
this
third
time
i
just
totally
get
it
it
helps
that
i
really
like
this
emerging
style
and
while
this
is
no
iniquity
it
can
definitely
stand
as
a
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkable
d
love
this
beer
easy
to
drink
good
price
great
taste
all
around
a
must
try
overall
pretty
flavorful
if
a
bit
thinbodied
but
not
bad
at
all
especially
out
of
a
can
poured
into
a
glass
this
is
a
very
dark
ipa
with
a
thick
topping
of
light
brown
head
you
get
mostly
sweet
malts
with
some
slight
roasted
aromas
on
the
nose
the
sweet
malts
come
through
first
i
noticed
some
earthy
undertones
before
the
hops
come
through
there
is
a
lingering
bitterness
that
interplays
with
the
malts
as
you
continue
to
drink
this
one
the
head
faded
rather
quickly
but
left
some
considerable
lacing
on
the
glass
another
decent
addition
to
the
black
ipa
family
that
seems
to
be
quite
popular
right
now
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
an
enjoyable
little
hopbite
the
pour
of
a
nice
porter
without
any
cloudy
body
nice
mocha
head
simple
lemon
zest
nose
and
floral
soapiness
brisk
feel
but
rather
simple
but
mild
malt
notes
seems
like
color
and
not
reinforcing
the
bright
hop
very
subtle
earth
bitter
and
a
hope
for
dimension
simplistic
jean
backbone
good
drinkability
a
decent
black
ipa
d
ill
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
this
beer
has
it
all
but
at
what
cost
its
so
confusing
and
clashing
that
i
dont
really
enjoy
it
very
much
i
understand
the
attempt
being
made
but
dont
agree
with
the
overall
result
of
the
flavors
i
would
leave
this
one
o
the
blend
of
a
stout
and
ipa
will
either
please
people
or
offend
two
different
expectations
interesting
beer
nonetheless
all
in
all
this
is
a
solid
brew
glad
to
get
to
try
it
definitely
good
if
youre
looking
for
an
interesting
take
on
an
ipa
or
if
youre
a
fan
of
black
tans
if
youre
looking
for
the
straight
and
narrow
though
dont
worry
about
this
one
wow
taste
is
something
different
im
not
sure
if
i
like
it
its
a
bit
metallic
i
dont
attribute
that
to
the
can
and
has
a
somewhat
sharp
tang
its
fairly
acidic
and
harsh
a
bit
grainy
as
well
there
are
some
hops
because
i
do
get
bitterness
on
this
but
it
seems
more
like
bitterness
from
roasted
malt
mouthfeel
is
fairly
watery
with
very
light
but
sharp
carbonation
its
not
so
easy
drinking
and
it
leaves
a
bit
of
an
off
flavor
in
your
mouth
honestly
im
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
almost
opaque
brown
a
nice
billow
of
tan
head
sticks
to
the
glass
smell
is
unique
highpitched
malts
combined
with
an
herbal
hops
allinall
sharp
but
very
nice
taste
is
nicely
complex
as
well
dark
toasty
campfire
malts
meld
into
a
pleasantly
bitter
finish
feel
is
nicely
carbonated
and
deceivingly
dry
and
thin
at
the
end
the
only
drawback
is
that
this
beer
is
so
varied
that
i
could
only
have
a
few
at
one
sitting
for
that
though
a
good
beer
and
a
great
introduction
to
craft
beer
in
a
can
nice
beer
worth
a
glass
or
two
md
medium
to
full
bodied
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
a
very
solid
beer
the
brew
is
thin
enough
to
session
like
crazy
i
bought
a
case
and
i
am
very
pleased
this
will
be
gobbled
up
for
a
nice
session
at
6
8
it
will
catch
up
with
you
very
good
stuff
my
first
from
21st
amendment
certainly
impressed
an
easy
drinking
brew
that
definitely
doesnt
let
you
forget
that
this
is
an
ipa
would
easily
buy
a
case
of
this
stuff
this
is
a
very
sessionable
brew
12oz
can
purchased
at
beverage
world
in

oglethorpe
ga
2
dark
black
color
decent
lace
short
head
smells
roasty
like
a
porter
tastes
very
much
like
a
porter
and
nothing
like
an
ipa
it
wasnt
even
hoppy
i
have
no
idea
how
old
this
was
but
i
am
really
starting
to
doubt
the
whole
black
ipa
phenomenon
its
like
most
of
them
are
just
porters
and
the
really
hoppy
ones
still
dont
make
me
think
ipa
hoppy
black
ale
would
be
a
better
moniker
for
these
shits
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brownblack
color
with
a
thick
frothy
tan
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
black
and
roasted
malt
scent
along
with
a
refreshingly
bitter
citrus
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
killer
citrus
hop
bite
up
front
laid
over
a
bed
of
black
and
roasted
malt
flavors
its
dry
and
roasted
with
a
fresh
hop
character
that
resinates
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
black
ipa
the
hop
character
is
outstanding
very
fresh
and
flavorful
d
these
arent
bad
but
i
wont
in
a
hurry
to
buy
more
without
freshness
dates
my
first
of
the
style
unlike
any
other
ipa
ive
had
this
is
not
only
due
to
the
roasted
malt
character
but
the
utter
lack
of
sweetness
to
the
ale
i
like
back
in
black
has
drinkability
that
belies
its
look
its
smooth
and
thirstquenching
and
is
suitable
for
drinking
more
than
one
on
a
hot
afternoon
the
flavor
and
feel
are
like
flat
cola
or
root
beer
however
with
nothing
lasting
moderate
carbonation
and
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
roasty
chocolate
and
toast
up
front
followed
by
creamy
notes
and
some
bitter
lemon
on
the
finish
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
black
ipa
style
but
still
very
nice
light
overall
feel
and
quite
refreshing
even
if
all
the
flavors
dont
quite
gel
together
d
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
venture
out
to
say
that
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
very
well
i
am
reviewing
this
beer
as
a
porter
because
i
really
like
it
but
just
dont
see
the
black
ipa
it
is
suposed
to
be
this
one
pours
a
nice
blackness
with
ruby
shades
when
penetrated
by
light
there
is
a
nice
white
frothy
head
upon
it
which
is
interesting
to
me
for
usually
beers
this
dark
produce
a
tan
or
brown
head
the
smells
are
intriguing
as
well
there
is
the
obviously
citrus
and
floral
notes
from
the
hops
that
comprise
an
ipa
but
its
mixed
with
and
to
a
lesser
degree
in
this
instance
roasted
caramel
malts
to
give
the
beer
a
different
dimension
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
of
a
pretty
hoppy
ipa
the
main
flavor
is
citrus
specifically
lemon
this
causes
the
brunt
of
the
bitterness
that
is
experienced
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
light
for
what
the
beer
actually
is
and
it
does
a
service
to
the
beer
in
my
opinion
if
you
like
the
hops
this
is
highly
drinkable
if
youre
like
me
and
are
indifferent
its
still
a
pleasant
brew
drinkability
not
bad
at
all
the
sourness
does
keep
me
coming
back
and
i
find
this
beer
refreshing
for
all
its
weirdness
made
a
pretty
good
tailgating
beer
yesterday
as
well
will
definitely
get
another
case
of
this
and
i
highly
reccommend
to
other
ipa
drinkers
who
havent
tried
the
black
ipa
style
yet
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
d
beer
has
come
a
long
wayfull
circle
drinking
a
black
ipa
out
of
can
cool
drinking
good
beer
very
cool
i
enjoy
this
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
an
intriguing
take
on
a
black
ipa
but
the
hops
were
not
as
present
as
is
usual
and
the
sour
taste
dominated
the
palate
to
produce
a
balanced
yet
offstyle
beer
worth
giving
a
try
if
you
like
sour
beer
but
not
to
my
liking
for
a
black
ipa
d
a
decent
cascadian
ale
there
are
others
that
i
like
more
in
this
category
but
it
is
worth
a
try
overall
a
rather
good
iba
not
bad
liked
what
it
was
which
was
a
watery
porter
mixed
with
a
splash
of
ipa
with
a
squeeze
of
lemon
unique
and
decent
drinkability
is
good
not
heavy
like
a
porter
and
not
overly
enamel
stripping
of
an
ipa
good
balance
12
in
a
night
would
not
be
asking
too
much
i
think
12oz
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
appears
black
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
takes
forever
to
go
away
it
smells
good
nothing
offensive
here
the
taste
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
hops
and
roasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
like
a
less
creamy
guiness
which
feels
very
nice
the
alcohol
is
hidden
well
i
could
drink
a
whole
6
pack
easy
and
i
rarely
drink
more
then
two
this
will
be
a
new
staple
for
me
and
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
this
year
medium
body
slightly
creamy
alcohol
is
hidden
well
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
good
thanks
to
bauermj
for
this
one
jet
black
in
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
full
of
sweet
pine
the
beer
finishes
with
a
moderate
amount
of
bitterness
it
has
a
mild
body
and
lots
of
carbonation
the
beer
has
very
clean
crisp
flavors
a
great
cascadian
ale
feel
is
mediumish
and
amply
carbed
up
the
head
last
forever
and
this
is
some
active
beer
here
goes
down
smooth
and
citrusy
and
not
very
bitter
as
the
darks
really
take
away
from
that
aspect
very
drinkable
beer
here
and
i
would
go
for
another
in
a
second
drinkability
delicious
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
brewery
there
is
a
nice
mix
of
malts
and
hops
in
this
one
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
body
is
spot
on
bitterness
and
roasted
qualities
are
in
check
but
the
flavor
is
missing
to
make
this
a
true
ipastyle
beer
this
is
one
of
the
3
canned
21st
amendment
beers
available
in
my
area
now
it
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
colorm
fairly
opaque
with
a
thick
light
tan
head
that
laces
in
dried
chunks
on
the
glass
it
smells
like
wet
resiny
hops
and
roasted
malts
and
the
taste
is
no
different
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
black
ipas
in
general
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
the
hops
take
enough
of
a
lead
to
keep
me
happy
the
bodys
kind
of
light
but
this
beer
goes
down
easy
this
beer
will
work
in
a
pinch
pours
dark
brown
with
a
swirly
head
smells
pretty
light
with
some
light
citrusy
hops
some
light
roastiness
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
good
deal
more
pronounced
this
isnt
a
blow
you
away
beer
but
something
about
the
nicely
balanced
creaminess
dry
stoutlike
roastiness
and
gentle
citrusy
bitterness
really
works
for
me
im
at
the
end
of
this
sixpack
and
this
beer
has
really
grown
on
me
nicely
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
quite
tasty
i
like
this
better
than
i
though
i
would
d
for
almost
7
and
dark
this
beer
drinks
extremely
well
it
goes
down
easy
due
to
the
coffeebuttery
finish
i
like
d
a
queer
blend
of
flavors
w
black
malt
and
bitter
hops
to
me
it
is
not
the
best
of
an
emerging
style
but
i
enjoyed
for
what
it
is
dm
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
really
hard
to
rate
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
but
dont
know
how
many
i
would
want
to
drink
it
is
really
different
and
something
worth
trying
but
probably
not
a
beer
i
am
going
to
stock
my
fridge
with
drinkability
not
too
shabby
hopforwardness
big
roast
flavor
is
a
pretty
interesting
combination
dont
think
this
one
was
my
cup
of
tea
the
berrylike
sweettart
thing
threw
me
off
a
bit
this
black
ipa
avoids
the
pitfalls
of
many
of
its
contemporaries
by
showcasing
bitter
roast
malt
character
instead
of
using
debittered
malt
as
essentially
food
coloring
good
on
ya
21st
d
meh
i
didnt
really
love
it
to
throw
down
10
50
for
a
sixer
but
it
was
cool
to
try
it
and
it
defiantly
better
than
that
horrid
excuse
for
a
watermelon
beer
drinkability
i
thought
this
was
really
good
first
black
ipa
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
definitely
recommend
this
one
d
nothing
too
special
here
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
had
better
black
i
p
a
s
and
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
an
i
p
a
i
think
i
would
reach
for
something
else
taste
is
simultaneously
sweet
refreshing
and
bitter
subtle
toasty
notes
but
also
a
solid
hop
bitterness
along
with
floral
and
grapefruit
all
the
way
through
high
on
alcohol
but
in
no
way
out
of
balance
with
the
malt
and
for
an
american
ipa
hops
bonus
the
carbonation
is
surprisingly
light
leaving
for
a
creamy
mouthfeel
that
works
really
well
with
the
burnt
barley
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
it
is
actually
quite
terrible
doesnt
taste
anything
like
a
bipa
hardy
any
fresh
hops
pretty
much
a
drainpour
drinkability
is
good
and
enjoyable
black
ipa
perfect
balance
going
on
with
out
either
side
dominating
overall
impression
an
easy
drinking
american
ale
love
this
interpretation
very
glad
we
can
get
21a
in
central
oh
now
pours
an
opaque
warm
sable
with
a
thick
finebubbled
light
tan
head
strong
aroma
is
fairly
hoppy
with
a
firm
undertone
of
citrus
mainly
orange
and
a
bit
of
grapefruit
strong
hoppy
flavor
has
smoky
and
nutty
undertones
and
hints
of
chocolate
and
licorice
it
fairly
successfully
marries
most
of
the
flavors
i
like
in
a
stout
or
porter
with
the
hoppy
and
citrus
flavors
i
appreciate
in
an
ipa
maybe
i
should
change
my
favorite
sort
of
beer
to
black
ipa
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
fizzy
with
a
slight
tinny
undertone
drinkability
its
black
its
bitter
but
the
hop
profile
while
certainly
present
wasnt
thankfully
abrasive
and
as
such
it
kind
of
reminded
me
of
averys
new
world
porter
overall
its
pretty
decent
i
dont
think
id
have
again
but
im
glad
i
had
it
once
definitely
worth
a
try
the
taste
picks
up
on
the
smell
but
adds
some
coffee
and
brown
sugar
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
still
very
wonderfully
drinkable
its
one
of
the
lighter
more
approachable
dark
ipas
ive
had
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
i
find
myself
gulping
however
i
try
not
to
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
had
from
21st
amendment
and
im
impressed
check
it
out
the
ol
crack
glug
produced
a
solid
twofingers
of
deeptan
foam
with
excellent
retention
it
looked
like
the
top
of
a
root
beer
float
color
was
not
black
as
a
previous
reviewer
noted
but
instead
a
deep
darkbrown
with
cola
highlights
nose
was
rich
with
piney
hops
i
have
missed
drinking
ipas
with
the
preponderance
of
canned
beers
coming
in
the
form
of
aals
i
dont
get
a
hop
jones
like
i
used
to
but
neither
have
i
kicked
the
hop
habit
thank
bob
that
the
chattering
monkey
on
my
back
has
gone
away
though
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
solid
hop
bite
initially
followed
by
a
roastiness
in
the
mouth
wow
what
a
brilliant
way
to
play
with
the
style
finish
was
dry
with
a
magnificent
interplay
between
the
hops
and
dark
malts
mentioned
on
the
can
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
be
terribly
refreshing
on
the
beach
but
it
definitely
merits
inclusion
in
the
cooler
in
a
limited
quantity
put
it
towards
the
back
on
the
bottom
next
to
the
ten
fidy
for
the
end
of
the
day
great
lacing
throughout
nice
and
black
decent
lace
this
beer
smells
of
aggressive
hops
columbus
or
something
similar
that
are
not
as
pleasant
floralcirtrussy
as
some
plenty
of
pine
notes
bitter
but
drinkable
this
is
a
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
several
of
but
the
malt
doesnt
play
much
more
of
a
role
other
than
colorindicator
some
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
and
slight
burnt
bread
on
the
finish
dry
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
black
ipa
could
use
a
bit
more
hop
presence
d
after
taste
ruins
any
flavor
that
comes
before
taste
this
is
an
ipa
worth
trying
mostly
due
to
the
heavy
and
sweet
presence
of
toasted
malts
the
bitterer
hop
presence
follows
up
along
with
a
bitter
cocoa
taste
the
feel
in
the
mouth
is
thickish
and
full
overall
immensely
drinkable
but
perhaps
not
quite
as
nicely
complex
as
some
other
options
like
dogfish
heads
190minute
ipa
d
im
not
a
fan
at
all
if
this
were
my
beer
i
would
tweak
a
little
bit
and
make
something
more
like
a
schwarzbier
out
of
it
a
very
nice
change
up
for
the
hopheads
out
there
me
included
as
the
leaves
start
to
fall
i
can
see
myself
putting
a
few
of
these
down
in
tne
end
it
is
a
nice
ballanced
beer
this
is
decent
enough
but
it
almost
feels
like
a
cross
between
multiple
styles
porter
ipa
stout
which
can
confuse
the
palate
d
id
love
to
have
this
beer
when
everyone
else
is
drinking
bud
light
or
maybe
i
need
new
friends
taste
comes
in
a
little
soapy
after
a
few
sips
it
acts
as
better
friends
w
yr
palate
the
bitterness
melds
with
the
hops
just
takes
some
time
to
get
it
all
together
leads
to
a
good
mouthfeel
a
dank
dark
resonance
on
the
tongue
this
one
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
a
palate
wrecker
i
like
it
when
canned
beers
are
tasty
pours
a
dark
brownblack
nearly
opaque
with
some
chocolatey
head
smell
is
pretty
typical
of
a
black
ipa
though
i
would
love
it
to
be
a
bit
more
hopforward
like
fresh
iniquity
or
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
roasted
malts
piney
hops
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
take
the
main
stage
on
the
nose
taste
is
the
samebright
kick
of
resinous
hops
on
the
start
quickly
overwhelmed
by
some
dark
roast
malts
with
dark
chocolate
underneath
bitterness
reemerges
on
the
finish
which
is
lingering
mf
is
pretty
good
standard
for
the
style
except
that
it
might
be
a
little
thin
smooth
though
drinkability
is
really
good
i
could
make
a
quick
session
out
of
this
stuff
well
done
all
in
all
i
wouldnt
buy
againmaybe
but
if
it
was
bought
for
me
i
couldnt
complain
overall
classifications
aside
this
is
a
pretty
good
stout
and
one
i
will
have
again
just
dont
call
it
a
black
ipa
not
even
close
drinkability
is
good
the
roasted
flavor
is
bit
drying
but
i
think
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
i
loved
the
smooth
taste
wouldnt
drink
a
whole
6
pack
of
this
but
a
few
could
be
in
order
i
really
enjoy
this
new
cascadian
black
ipa
style
not
the
best
one
ive
had
but
still
good
got
a
6
pack
from
wholefoods
and
i
never
even
finished
a
can
tried
pouring
into
a
glass
drinking
it
out
of
the
can
either
way
it
was
terrible
resiny
hop
bitterness
dingy
malt
character
and
an
unpleasent
sweetness
from
underattenuation
all
in
all
this
is
in
my
top
5
worst
beers
in
the
bay
area
pours
a
deep
copper
color
to
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
roasty
coffee
and
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
taste
just
like
the
aroma
roasty
coffee
and
a
small
pine
like
hop
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
roasty
coffee
aftertaste
kind
of
like
a
hoppy
porter
i
have
to
say
this
tastes
more
like
a
stout
with
a
hop
backbone
compared
to
deschutes
hop
in
the
dark
and
stones
black
ipano
clue
was
its
called
as
i
got
it
on
tap
mysteriously
a
buffalo
wild
wings
and
the
waitress
was
clueless
other
than
that
it
was
from
stone
which
tasted
more
like
a
good
solid
ipa
with
a
heavy
malt
backbone
id
liken
this
to
troegs
dead
reckoning
porter
some
sawdust
aroma
but
predominately
malt
heavy
lacing
this
is
an
alright
ipa
i
guess
but
where
are
the
hops
mini
growler
pour
from
the
good
folks
at
deciccos
in
ardsley
ny
pours
black
medium
tanslate
head
frothy
and
lasting
forever
at
the
very
thick
film
stage
leaves
a
collar
as
well
and
bits
of
fine
lacing
musty
caramel
and
winter
spice
in
the
nose
chalky
hoppy
malty
not
much
fruit
or
complexity
mostly
i
get
a
quite
dry
and
yes
again
a
chalky
note
as
it
warms
dark
malts
and
mildly
gritty
hops
come
to
the
fore
nothing
overly
impressive
going
on
here
decent
ipa
not
much
beyond
that
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
black
color
with
a
1
inch
head
considerable
lacing
throughout
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
some
citrus
present
taste
is
a
good
balance
of
hops
and
maltsa
bit
of
citrus
to
it
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
there
is
a
wonderful
balance
between
hop
and
malt
all
in
a
creamy
smooth
froth
there
is
the
obvious
alcohol
that
one
expects
in
a
beer
of
this
type
i
found
it
interesting
unique
and
highly
quaffable
try
it
if
you
can
obtain
it
quite
drinkable
too
yum
i
have
to
say
yum
i
am
compelled
to
report
d
a
drinkable
beer
yes
a
new
innovative
black
ipa
novelty
beer
style
yes
this
beer
falls
short
on
balance
the
hops
in
this
beer
were
just
not
a
big
player
in
the
flavor
more
hops
please
d
actually
drinks
well
a
new
style
that
certainly
needs
to
be
refined
malty
ipas
wont
work
for
me
hv
overall
an
ok
example
of
a
black
ipa
but
not
that
impressive
a
little
offtasting
but
i
liked
it
d
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
ive
been
a
little
down
on
this
style
until
now
most
of
the
beers
ive
had
like
this
seemed
like
they
were
just
dark
ipas
without
much
character
from
the
malt
or
they
were
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
with
too
much
roasted
malts
making
the
beer
more
like
a
stout
than
an
ipa
this
beer
had
nice
balance
and
great
flavors
i
hope
to
have
more
like
this
in
the
future
i
enjoy
other
21st
amendment
beers
and
canned
craft
beers
in
general
i
actually
had
a
12
pack
of
dales
pale
in
my
hand
before
seeing
back
in
black
at
my
local
store
i
hope
this
was
a
problem
with
a
particular
can
or
of
bad
transit
drinkability
interesting
but
a
one
at
a
time
beer
for
me
ive
had
it
by
itself
and
also
with
a
meal
but
i
dont
think
ive
found
the
right
food
to
go
with
it
yet
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
basically
it
seems
like
an
overhopped
porter
to
meroasted
malt
flavors
with
more
citrus
bitterness
than
the
porter
interesting
beer
to
try
d
easy
enough
drinking
but
not
very
interesting
d
im
really
enjoying
this
so
far
i
had
sort
of
gotten
the
notion
that
black
ipasor
ibas
whatever
werent
my
favorite
as
the
grain
bill
and
hops
always
seemed
to
clash
i
love
this
combination
though
which
is
probably
because
it
uses
two
of
my
absolute
favorite
hopscolumbus
and
centennial
pous
like
a
stout
light
cream
head
that
decides
to
coat
the
sides
of
my
pint
glass
with
each
sip
aroma
had
dark
roasted
malts
with
herbal
hops
going
on
more
like
a
hoppy
porter
or
a
stout
than
other
black
ipas
ive
come
across
this
is
the
popular
style
of
the
moment
everybody
is
making
a
dark
hoppy
beer
nice
to
see
some
variation
not
overly
bitter
in
anyway
flavor
was
creamy
dark
roasts
a
mix
of
dark
chocolate
and
light
coffee
tones
with
blasts
of
herbal
slightly
citric
hops
goes
together
ncely
a
good
balanced
blend
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
smooth
and
easy
going
i
cant
complain
its
actally
silky
texture
drinkability
overall
a
nice
blalanced
hoppy
dark
beer
i
cant
really
call
it
a
bipa
compared
to
other
more
aggressive
versions
but
it
was
enjoyable
md
mouthfeel
is
weak
but
certainly
a
beer
that
you
dont
mind
keeping
in
your
mouth
to
enjoy
the
different
flavors
as
for
drinkability
i
doubt
that
this
would
be
a
goto
for
any
single
style
lover
but
it
is
an
interesting
an
complex
beer
to
try
once
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
formed
a
1
12
tan
head
above
the
slightly
cloudy
reddish
brown
brew
dense
head
lasts
nicely
with
sporadic
chunky
lacing
aroma
is
grapefruity
hops
taste
is
sweet
through
to
the
middle
then
citrus
and
grapefruit
hops
come
on
lasting
through
the
close
mouthfeel
is
ubersmooth
and
drinkability
is
superb
another
great
beer
to
get
for
when
cans
are
better
than
glass
or
anytime
i
loved
the
smooth
taste
it
had
and
polished
off
the
6er
pretty
quickly
its
definitely
something
i
would
want
to
sit
and
drink
on
a
cool
autumn
night
d
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
but
seemed
much
mroe
malty
to
me
than
hoppy
would
try
again
d
eh
decent
just
missing
either
some
complexity
or
grace
of
others
like
it
i
was
ready
to
move
on
about
halfway
through
this
glass
d
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
this
would
be
very
drinkable
if
you
looking
to
enjoy
a
hoppy
ipa
then
this
ale
probably
wont
cut
it
for
you
t
luckily
the
off
smell
didnt
make
it
into
the
taste
it
has
a
straight
forward
black
ipa
taste
that
i
am
used
to
in
others
i
have
tried
it
has
a
nice
dark
malt
presence
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
then
rolls
into
a
nice
balanced
hop
finish
with
very
little
bitterness
overall
a
good
example
of
this
new
style
the
drinkability
on
this
beer
is
great
i
am
about
half
way
done
with
the
first
and
feel
like
i
could
easily
go
through
a
six
pack
d
pretty
easy
drinking
this
beer
is
decent
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
like
i
was
hoping
could
go
for
some
more
hop
flavor
that
being
said
this
being
in
a
can
really
helps
it
stick
out
i
would
like
having
this
available
to
me
locally
just
for
the
convenience
of
it
coming
in
a
can
i
would
consider
picking
this
up
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
id
like
to
see
some
more
reviews
to
see
if
anyone
else
gets
the
metallic
flavors
pours
a
black
semithick
color
with
a
tan
staying
1
finger
head
looks
good
smell
is
subdued
with
hops
and
malt
some
toffee
and
burnt
toast
or
caramelwith
some
chocolate
flavor
is
similar
its
light
on
the
porter
flavors
and
light
on
the
ipa
flavorspine
and
citrus
are
there
so
is
toffee
and
roasted
maltsbut
its
all
so
light
mouth
feel
is
light
in
relation
to
the
style
it
has
subdued
flavors
21st
just
does
not
do
it
for
me
as
a
brewery
however
out
of
the
3
ive
tried
i
did
like
this
one
the
bestmy
recommendation
buy
a
single
wasnt
please
with
this
one
it
looked
great
in
the
glass
but
fell
apart
upon
tasting
both
of
the
21st
ammendment
beers
were
big
misses
for
me
im
not
sure
if
the
previously
mentioned
stout
flavors
are
influencing
my
perception
here
but
the
feel
seems
very
watery
easy
drinking
but
im
ready
for
something
more
engaging
and
im
less
than
one
quarter
done
with
this
pint
db
like
others
mention
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
good
balance
here
between
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
the
weak
mouthfeel
certainly
doesnt
help
either
why
fix
something
that
isnt
broken
black
ipas
just
dont
really
do
it
for
me
that
being
said
i
think
this
is
a
good
effort
from
a
brewery
that
i
usually
really
love
stick
to
what
you
guys
to
best
d
very
drinkable
like
i
said
before
i
only
attended
to
have
one
and
ended
up
drinking
three
very
refreshing
and
satisfying
which
surprised
me
cause
it
only
comes
in
cans
which
you
expect
that
metallic
taste
which
it
didnt
have
at
all
with
that
said
two
big
thumbs
up
to
the
25th
admendment
brewing
company
for
a
very
enjoyable
american
style
ipa
mouthfeel
is
kinda
thin
drinkability
is
average
at
best
good
to
try
but
this
isnt
something
im
going
back
to
addendum
awesome
can
and
carry
case
db
i
just
dont
think
there
is
a
good
balance
between
the
decent
malt
and
hop
profiles
the
weak
mouthfeel
certainly
doesnt
help
either
seems
like
the
black
ipa
is
one
of
the
new
trends
that
might
not
make
it
very
far
just
feels
a
bit
off
single
from
river
city
cellars
richmond
va
drinkability
hell
yea
fond
of
this
one
for
sure
a
nice
hybrid
of
styles
but
still
maintains
the
ipa
feel
this
was
decent
enough
i
guess
but
ive
certainly
had
better
black
ipas
recently
probably
the
lack
of
body
hurt
this
the
most
but
a
little
more
depth
to
the
flavors
would
have
been
welcome
as
well
i
think
one
can
here
was
good
enough
for
me
another
decision
made
for
me
by
my
boy
mike
in
il
with
jethro
tulls
windup
rockin
in
the
background
it
pours
a
barely
transulcent
very
dark
ruby
brown
topped
by
a
steadfast
finger
of
ecru
foam
the
nose
is
odd
kinda
like
a
ruby
red
grapefruit
drizzled
with
lemon
juice
some
orange
slices
and
pine
sap
find
their
way
in
there
as
well
and
i
assume
thats
some
light
caramel
thats
trying
to
evade
me
in
the
back
honestly
this
smells
kinda
weird
hard
to
explain
just
doesnt
seem
quite
right
the
taste
is
pretty
hopforward
with
plenty
o
citrus
hops
flying
at
me
grapefruit
orange
and
lime
flavors
resulting
instead
of
straight
caramel
though
some
light
roasted
malts
make
their
way
into
town
blowin
in
like
the
fools
who
always
fuck
with
clint
eastwood
much
to
their
ultimate
dismay
the
two
competing
sides
continue
fighting
throughout
the
tasting
making
for
quite
a
pleasant
feel
all
while
chubby
checkers
limbo
rock
makes
me
wanna
dance
a
little
still
somethings
missing
leaving
me
ultimately
unsatisfied
as
a
whole
the
body
is
a
heavy
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
feel
overall
a
nice
bipa
or
cda
whichever
you
prefer
definitely
worth
a
taste
d
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
out
there
and
i
am
generall
a
big
fan
of
21st
ammendment
stuff
this
has
a
funny
aromaflavor
that
disagreed
with
me
from
the
start
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
instead
of
the
4pk6pk
based
on
others
reviews
maybe
i
got
an
off
can
but
i
have
to
say
im
just
not
getting
what
others
are
saying
about
this
one
d
although
it
looks
and
tastes
like
a
hopped
up
porter
in
truth
its
more
like
a
hopped
up
schwarzbier
seriously
hopped
up
to
the
point
where
any
and
all
malt
sweetness
is
pretty
much
eradicated
hoppy
and
earthy
easily
drinkable
and
handsome
black
ipa
is
an
interesting
style
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
sooner
or
later
most
breweries
will
take
a
stab
at
it
just
popped
a
can
of
this
the
other
night
also
had
the
pleasure
of
tasting
it
on
tap
at
cbs
the
nose
is
full
of
bright
citrus
hop
qualities
with
lingering
charcoal
and
cocoa
bitterness
in
the
background
this
beer
drink
very
well
at
cooler
temps
the
bright
citrus
hop
flavors
are
there
in
the
front
to
welcome
you
in
while
the
roasted
malts
bring
you
home
on
the
back
of
the
palate
along
with
hints
of
caramel
could
use
for
a
bit
extra
punch
in
the
way
of
bittering
hops
a
bit
thin
in
the
body
despite
a
nice
initial
creaminess
as
the
beer
warms
the
big
hop
presence
fades
and
gives
way
to
burned
coffee
and
roasted
malts
allinall
a
very
tasty
drop
and
decent
example
of
style
if
you
can
call
it
that
poured
from
can
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
was
pitch
black
at
first
it
was
a
lovely
pairing
that
came
off
like
dry
irish
stout
with
dry
cocoa
malts
and
classic
american
citrus
hops
unfortunately
as
it
warmed
up
during
diner
a
less
pleasant
though
not
bad
molasses
flavor
came
forward
im
digging
the
style
and
its
worth
checking
out
if
you
are
too
d
a
good
black
ipa
with
a
more
heavy
hand
with
the
hops
needed
mainly
to
better
balance
the
roasted
malty
char
flavor
that
pervades
this
brew
a
slight
change
to
the
recipe
to
put
a
more
citrus
hoppy
signature
on
this
brew
will
push
this
beer
higher
and
make
it
a
big
winner
i
think
f
still
pretty
bitter
as
it
finishes
some
grassy
hops
come
out
at
this
point
and
bring
more
slight
citrus
and
pine
but
very
light
a
slight
sticky
syrupy
finish
but
no
real
sweetness
as
it
dries
to
a
somewhat
dry
finish
some
lingering
earthy
and
spicy
hop
pellet
flavors
with
late
hop
addition
flavors
not
bad
for
a
black
ipa
doesnt
go
overboard
in
any
category
and
is
pretty
clean
and
tasty
going
on
trips
with
this
would
be
great
cause
taking
it
in
the
can
always
works
better
this
beer
pours
a
black
color
the
head
is
a
mammoth
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
thick
cap
of
foam
the
aroma
is
of
grapefruit
pine
resin
and
citrus
it
is
completely
dominated
by
hops
without
even
a
trace
of
darker
malt
aromas
the
taste
is
still
very
hoppy
but
there
is
a
solid
malt
profile
too
the
grapefruit
pine
and
citrus
from
the
aroma
are
still
present
with
the
addition
of
of
nice
roasted
malt
notes
the
malt
and
the
hops
are
well
integrated
within
this
beers
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
will
certainly
drink
again
12
ounce
can
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
about
an
inch
tan
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
good
aroma
is
mostly
pine
and
citrusy
hops
grapefruit
along
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
it
tastes
like
pine
and
citrusy
mostly
grapefruit
some
tropical
fruit
hops
bready
malt
and
some
coffee
and
roasted
malt
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
oily
and
very
smooth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
very
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
ipa
id
definitely
buy
this
again
thanks
to
joe
at
blacklick
wine
and
spirits
for
recommending
this
to
me
earlier
today
great
brew
in
a
can
from
21st
amendment
dark
brown
to
black
color
with
a
ruddy
tan
head
subtly
malty
aroma
with
a
titch
of
herbal
hoppiness
medium
body
almost
light
but
with
a
good
presence
of
flavor
nothing
sticks
out
or
overwhelms
well
balanced
and
eminently
drinkable
overall
not
too
shabby
i
enjoyed
it
both
cold
and
warm
my
big
complaint
is
the
lingering
flavors
it
leaves
on
your
palate
it
tastes
like
the
bitterness
and
acidity
have
mixed
together
and
glued
themselves
to
my
palate
dgot
a
sixer
drank
four
quite
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
showcase
of
the
style
that
just
happens
to
be
available
in
a
stylish
package
no
complaints
here
drinkability
it
wasnt
my
favorite
but
if
you
like
lighter
beers
maybe
its
for
you
md
while
lighter
than
other
black
ipas
that
i
have
tried
bib
still
has
some
structure
its
silky
mouthfeel
also
makes
it
a
clean
easy
drinking
brew
its
a
solid
effort
by
21st
amendment
and
definitely
wrth
trying
a
very
complex
beer
in
my
opinion
again
more
stout
than
other
bipas
ive
had
but
very
much
an
ipa
at
the
same
time
as
well
very
nice
can
as
well
as
far
as
im
concerned
another
solid
showing
from
21st
amendment
on
a
tangent
what
a
great
name
for
a
brewery
d
tasty
brew
with
a
reasonable
abv
decent
balance
and
easy
on
the
palate
d
meh
not
amazing
not
terrible
the
beer
looks
really
nice
its
very
dark
with
a
thick
brown
head
a
but
of
it
seems
to
linger
over
the
course
of
the
beer
it
does
smell
a
little
bit
cakey
but
that
not
necessarily
bad
has
a
malty
flavor
to
it
almost
to
the
point
of
tasting
a
little
bit
like
whoppers
its
certainly
not
bad
just
not
really
what
i
expected
the
mouthfeel
is
alright
for
such
a
dark
beer
it
didnt
seem
terribly
smooth
it
was
drinkable
and
if
i
were
to
drink
a
dark
beer
on
a
hot
day
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
one
to
start
with
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
drink
definatly
a
good
beer
all
around
except
for
the
husky
grains
does
not
seem
to
follow
the
style
it
is
listed
under
here
on
ba
of
an
american
ipa
but
for
a
black
ipa
it
does
the
trick
however
hop
aroma
does
suffer
an
interesting
brew
but
not
somthing
i
could
see
myself
drinking
again
notes
this
beer
is
kind
of
all
over
the
map
the
appearance
is
definitely
its
best
best
attribute
it
looks
amazing
the
color
is
as
black
as
i
expected
and
the
head
is
crazy
big
the
aroma
is
pretty
bland
but
a
little
better
than
average
overall
it
ends
up
making
a
good
beer
but
nothing
earth
changing
pours
a
dark
colalike
brown
with
2
fingers
of
head
noteworthy
lacing
settled
in
the
glass
it
has
a
look
reminiscent
of
a
stout
so
its
funny
to
take
in
the
citrus
and
pine
evident
in
the
nose
taste
is
as
you
would
expect
more
malty
than
a
traditional
ipa
but
the
citrus
and
pine
notes
are
certainly
present
quite
tasty
actually
medium
to
highly
carbonated
with
a
velvety
sort
of
mouthfeel
6
8
abv
is
a
bit
high
for
a
session
beer
but
i
could
see
having
a
few
of
these
without
much
trouble
not
un
upper
eschelon
beer
but
definitely
a
keeper
this
is
my
first
beer
from
21st
amendment
brewing
and
i
must
say
im
quite
impressed
back
in
black
certainly
has
no
shortage
of
flavor
and
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
ill
nitpick
and
say
it
would
be
a
little
better
with
more
hop
bitterness
its
very
good
stuff
as
it
is
though
cool
can
too
definitely
recommended
do
standard
american
ipa
but
wait
this
ones
black
it
looks
great
and
feel
great
but
other
than
that
this
ones
not
worth
seeking
out
get
in
your
cartruckbike
pick
a
direction
drive
4560
minutes
and
theres
a
good
chance
youll
find
a
better
ipa
at
one
of
your
local
breweriesbrewpubs
cheers
not
quite
black
in
color
so
the
name
is
misleading
dark
brown
with
a
large
tan
head
that
had
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thin
cap
heavy
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
really
weak
i
just
pick
up
some
citrus
hops
sufficiently
hoppy
flavor
giving
citrus
hints
the
dark
malt
is
used
more
than
just
color
i
do
get
some
roasted
malt
in
the
flavor
bitterness
is
moderate
and
at
65
ibus
well
represented
the
body
is
a
little
more
thick
and
chewy
than
most
ipas
and
i
credit
that
to
the
dark
malts
nice
carbonation
available
in
cans
so
the
drinkability
automatically
goes
up
has
a
couple
of
weaknesses
but
otherwise
a
solid
ipa
d
goes
down
easily
well
blended
really
enjoyed
the
malthop
blend
on
this
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
the
black
ipa
style
definitely
worth
sitting
with
for
a
while
seems
more
like
a
hoppy
porter
than
a
cascadian
dark
ale
its
definitely
a
hoppy
porter
though
its
pretty
decent
nothing
spectacular
though
ill
just
stick
with
edmund
fitzgerald
d
its
good
and
if
you
really
like
the
roasthops
thing
of
dipas
or
cdas
take
your
pick
this
one
one
is
definitely
a
sessionable
one
very
dark
with
clear
coppery
brown
edges
and
a
fluffy
tan
cap
good
head
retention
with
spotty
clumpy
lace
hoppy
aroma
lots
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
pith
chocolate
notes
some
brown
sugar
slight
alcohol
sharp
piney
bitterness
juicy
grapefruit
flavour
malty
sweetness
and
cocoa
towards
the
end
very
creamy
texture
with
fine
carbonation
but
the
body
felt
a
bit
light
i
liked
it
and
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
the
flavor
is
burnt
caramel
and
coffee
flavored
malt
with
a
juicy
ride
like
hop
profile
on
top
the
prominent
flavors
are
bittersweet
grapefruit
and
a
sharp
herbal
flavor
to
the
hoppiness
as
well
overall
this
beer
is
a
well
balanced
and
excellent
example
of
a
black
ipa
and
also
would
serve
as
a
good
introduction
to
this
style
for
those
more
tuning
off
by
the
idea
of
hops
and
roasty
malts
d
easy
to
drink
flavors
are
good
and
last
brings
me
to
like
21stab
more
eh
the
offflavor
in
this
one
ruins
its
drinkability
for
me
i
bought
the
six
pack
but
i
wish
i
had
tried
a
single
first
i
probably
wouldnt
have
purchased
it
again
i
hope
it
grows
on
me
its
not
terrible
but
not
pleasing
either
not
the
best
of
black
ipas
but
pretty
good
i
definitely
like
seeing
new
craft
beer
in
a
can
and
this
is
no
exception
ahhh
man
what
a
nice
black
ipa
not
as
huge
as
sublimely
self
righteous
but
right
there
with
yakima
twilight
tied
for
my
2nd
favorite
of
the
style
that
ive
had
so
far
and
it
is
a
great
value
to
boot
will
buy
again
and
again
and
again

not

better
than
the

would
i
buy
more
of
it
yep
as
soon
as
this
glass
is
empty
another
can
will
be
opened
and
it
will
be
refilled
d
somewhat
drinkable
id
give
it
a
3
0
normally
because
its
so
far
off
from
an
ipa
but
i
appreciate
the
creativity
here
that
21st
amendment
is
trying
to
introduce
there
is
nothing
in
the
book
that
says
ipas
must
not
include
chocaltey
flavors
it
does
need
work
d
ok
d
very
good
drinkability
i
would
have
probably
liked
a
little
more
bitterness
in
the
taste
but
thats
just
me
overall
a
very
good
black
ipa
or
cda
whichever
you
choose
to
call
it
will
definitely
be
getting
again
mouthfeel
is
nice
decent
light
refreshing
body
and
nice
lower
carb
gives
a
slightly
creamy
feel
drinkable
but
just
lacking
that
bit
of
personality
id
like
to
see
this
was
good
but
a
bit
amateurish
imo
drinkability
is
very
good
nice
black
ipa
flavorful
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
notes
good
carbonation
good
malt
to
hop
balance
wondering
if
they
actually
brewed
this
baby
or
if
they
had
a
guest
brewer
do
it
because
its
a
great
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
crisp
from
the
carbonation
and
semidry
in
the
finish
i
had
a
couple
of
these
the
other
night
and
really
enjoyed
it
not
too
hoppy
like
many
west
coast
ipas
and
it
was
quite
drinkable
dark
in
color
very
smooth
drinker
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
i
suspect
it
wont
be
here
on
the
east
coast
enough
to
be
a
great
bar
favorite
but
if
you
can
get
this
on
a
regular
basis
you
should
had
this
on
tap
at
stub
n
herbs
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
head
aroma
is
like
a
little
baby
darkness
nice
roastiness
with
huge
hop
presence
but
on
a
lighter
scale
hops
are
nicely
balanced
with
the
roasted
malts
when
its
cold
but
becomes
overly
hoppy
as
it
warms
which
throws
it
out
of
balance
the
last
few
swigs
of
the
goblet
yielded
a
bitter
minty
herbal
hop
flavor
that
just
didnt
mesh
well
with
the
dull
roastiness
i
would
have
liked
more
sweetness
in
this
beer
accentuate
the
hops
but
it
wasnt
bad
when
it
was
cold
d
this
particular
batch
does
the
black
ipa
justice
but
not
a
style
that
i
particularly
love
drinkability

flavor
is
sweet
initiaaly
with
orangey

and
a

very
enjoyable
not

roasty
as
some
of
the
other

with
a

well
done
cant
say
id
go
back
for
more
mehhh
while
certainly
not
wretched
cant
see
any
reason
why
id
want
to
try
this
again
overall
this
i
find
this
to
be
a
wonderful
black
ipa
and
another
strong
offering
from
21st
amendment
recommended
beer
is
a
little
thin
imo
and
here
is
the
roast
it
mixes
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
the
hop
bitterness
its
not
a
terrible
mix
but
it
does
seem
a
little
out
of
place
beer
is
a
little
harsh
with
all
that
back
of
the
mouth
bitterness
with
very
little
in
the
other
parts
of
the
palate
to
connect
them
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
suffers
this
is
my
first
black
ipa
for
what
its
worth
pours
opaque
black
overwhelming
grapefruit
in
the
aroma
so
much
so
that
i
cant
get
anything
else
thin
creamy
head
disappears
quickly
but
leaves
lots
of
lacing
taste
lots
of
grapefruit
but
some
pine
thick
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
russian
imperial
bizarre
and
has
some
palette
dissonance
to
have
this
palette
with
the
hop
profile
back
end
has
a
peculiar
combo
of
hop
bitterness
and
stout
bitterness
i
love
this
beer
well
balanced
i
would
drink
this
any
time
awesome
i
had
this
in
growler
the
color
is
really
awesome
for
an
ipa
it
truly
is
black
and
i
have
never
seen
a
black
ipa
before
i
have
been
impressed
with
21st
amdt
brewery
since
trying
their
watermelon
and
regular
ipa
this
beer
smells
of
dark
roasted
malt
and
some
nice
hops
it
tastes
excellent
as
it
has
a
nice
coffee
and
roasted
taste
which
compliment
that
big
hops
very
well
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
as
it
doesnt
have
that
back
of
your
throat
dryness
that
some
ipas
tend
to
exhibit
you
could
drink
this
all
night
if
you
were
an
ipa
fan
great
job
again
to
21st
amendment
who
is
really
establishing
themselves
as
a
top
10
brewer
overall
solid
throughout
sessionable
and
hopefully
will
become
more
plentiful
in
my
area
drinkability
very
drinkable
it
goes
down
smooth
overall
this
is
a
very
solid
dark
ipa
and
one
thats
well
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
the
style
drinkability
this
beer
had
a
nice
overall
flavor
and
qas
considerably
easy
to
quaff
drinkability
is
usually
an
issue
with
this
style
for
me
but
this
one
doesnt
come
off
too
heavy
alcohol
plays
no
role
in
the
flavor
profile
and
this
is
a
very
tasty
example
of
a
great
up
and
coming
style
kind
of
a
sinkwater
smell
d
an
excellent
beer
a
great
ipa
kicked
up
a
notch
with
some
light
roasted
malt
its
not
on
the
21st
amendment
website
and
i
trust
my
fellow
bas
but
i
thought
that
i
should
mention
that
the
abv
was
listed
as
7
2
at
the
store
which
would
make
sense
as
back
in
black
is
brewed
along
the
same
lines
as
the
ipa
who
cares
really
anyway
the
beer
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
purplish
highlights
and
a
good
creamy
mocha
head
that
leaves
excellent
lacing
im
not
really
sure
how
to
rate
the
appearance
of
an
intentionally
dark
ipa
which
was
certainly
not
to
style
but
i
like
how
it
looked
the
aroma
was
very
close
to
the
ipa
strong
rich
hop
aromas
of
pine
and
spruce
with
a
tinge
of
citrus
and
herbs
the
flavor
brings
the
dark
malt
into
play
with
subtle
roasted
notes
underlying
the
strong
hop
flavors
ive
only
had
one
other
dark
ipa
that
i
can
think
of
stones
11thsublimely
self
righteous
and
while
they
have
different
hop
bills
theyre
similarly
delicious
its
a
great
variant
on
the
style
but
oddly
rare
among
commercial
brewers
although
the
homebrew
community
seems
to
have
embraced
it
drinkability
is
high
this
is
damn
tasty
really
easy
to
loose
the
roast
in
the
pungency
of
the
hops
but
its
there
no
doubt
and
isnt
overly
chocolatey
or
sweet
like
of
the
other
black
ipas
ive
had
wow
super
impressed
with
21a
each
beer
is
better
then
the
next
d
very
i
really
like
the
dark
ipas
and
this
one
is
one
of
the
better
examples
pours
to
a
black
color
with
brownishred
tints
when
viewed
against
light
the
head
is
a
pale
cream
color
with
minimal
retention
delicate
lacing
left
on
the
glass
some
hoplike
aromas
up
front
but
with
a
definite
malty
character
the
flavor
is
a
near
perfect
balance
of
malt
and
hops
the
carbonation
and
body
are
ideal
feels
great
going
down
ive
had
much
of
the
catalogue
produced
by
lakefront
but
my
first
time
trying
this
one
they
do
a
great
job
with
a
lot
of
different
recipes
and
didnt
disappoint
on
this
one
reasonable
price
too
6pack
for
7
99
i
like
version
of
style
o
not
a
bad
take
on
the
black
ipa
style
but
certainly
not
the
best
the
hop
character
is
definitely
oldschool
pine
and
grapefruit
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
and
is
actually
kind
of
refreshing
these
days
however
the
body
isnt
robust
enough
to
give
balance
to
the
hops
while
certainly
worth
a
go
iba
is
noticeably
inferior
to
lakefronts
wonderful
ipa
overall
could
be
a
bit
bigger
but
its
a
beer
i
want
to
turn
my
friends
and
local
brewer
carton
on
to
good
sign
must
try
quite
good
an
excellent
everyday
brew
priced
just
right
at
96pack
way
overpriced
at
5
for
the
bomber
too
bad
its
not
available
yearround
as
it
would
be
a
welcome
hit
of
sweet
roastiness
in
summer
while
still
refreshing
with
its
lighter
body
and
crisp
carbonation
another
very
good
wisconsin
black
ale
nearly
as
good
as
new
glarus
black
top
and
radio
free
iba
lake
louie
but
those
two
are
a
cut
above
this
one
recommendation
an
excellent
easy
to
find
iba
in
either
12
or
22oz
options
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
aba
with
a
very
nice
flavor
profile
could
be
a
bit
bigger
and
would
love
to
see
lakefront
brew
an
imperial
version
of
this
beer
complex
rich
and
delicious
ive
found
that
sometimes
theres
a
clash
between
hop
bitterness
and
roast
here
not
with
this
one
though
both
are
present
great
choice
of
hops
and
malts
here
very
welldone
great
example
of
the
style
nice
moderate
carbonation
and
body
o
spice
up
your
american
ipa
with
a
little
dark
malt
for
a
pineandchocolate
beer
that
finishes
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
add
bite
but
not
control
all
the
other
flavors
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
black
ipa
relatively
mild
for
the
style
but
it
has
a
nice
balance
very
drinkable
poured
bomber
into
34oz
mug
jet
black
in
the
mug
showing
dark
brown
in
light
thick
tight
fluffy
white
head
that
isnt
huge
but
is
really
beautiful
smells
of
lighter
roasted
malts
and
piney
hops
taste
is
big
on
roasted
malts
sweet
caramel
and
bittersweet
chocolate
with
hops
coming
in
towards
the
end
for
a
bitter
and
dryer
than
expected
finish
but
its
still
wet
and
a
bit
sticky
at
the
end
a
great
black
ale
although
id
like
it
hoppier
mouthfeel
is
amazing
though
creamy
perfection
man
this
is
a
great
brew
my
favorite
black
ipa
to
date
smooth
hoppy
bursting
with
flavor
but
not
overwhelming
black
and
topped
with
a
mediumsized
tan
head
the
beer
is
enticing
and
the
smell
is
of
slightly
roasted
grain
some
malt
and
mediumstrength
herbal
hops
the
taste
is
more
intense
than
the
aroma
powerful
balanced
and
dark
the
beer
has
a
great
roasted
dark
malt
flavor
backed
by
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
both
are
proportional
and
the
result
is
excellent
the
body
is
full
and
creamy
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
brew
giving
this
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
slightly
because
ive
had
it
before
and
it
was
much
better
o
a
black
ipa
that
definitely
leans
more
on
the
hoppy
side
but
still
manages
to
bring
along
some
black
ale
malts
a
solid
brew
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
and
one
that
certainly
will
not
disappoint
o
definitely
please
with
this
the
dominant
flavors
of
piney
hops
and
nutty
malt
are
contrasting
yet
well
balanced
props
to
andrenaline
for
sending
this
out
o
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
highly
recommended
would
happily
add
this
to
my
regular
rotation
this
is
a
nice
and
easy
to
drink
black
ale
the
hop
tones
are
there
and
stay
pretty
smooth
its
not
all
up
in
your
face
could
have
a
few
less
wrinkles
in
the
profile
but
no
matter
this
is
a
nice
drinker
always
happy
to
try
something
by
lakefront
overall
a
pleasantly
light
and
crisp
ale
more
balanced
than
expected
stays
away
from
the
treacly
sweetness
many
dark
american
ales
suffer
from
well
balanced
and
each
element
has
its
turn
to
shine
recommended
i
poured
the
lakefront
iba
into
a
wine
glass
because
that
was
all
that
was
available
to
me
at
the
time
the
result
was
a
newfound
love
the
manilla
colored
head
poured
perfectly
and
the
glass
allowed
for
a
wonderful
bouquet
to
emit
from
the
glass
lakefronts
iba
is
no
hop
bomb
but
a
delicious
balance
of
subtle
hops
and
approachable
black
malt
at
6
5
it
is
still
sessionable
enough
to
consume
on
a
hot
hot
day
at
the
same
time
it
leaves
a
hoppy
resin
on
the
back
of
the
palate
will
buy
again
cheers
lakefront
overall
probably
not
one
id
get
again
this
beer
pours
brilliantly
clear
very
dark
brown
with
a
mahogany
glow
when
held
to
a
light
and
a
sticky
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
highly
hoppy
mainly
citrus
pine
and
floral
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
strong
hop
flavorpine
and
citrus
zest
with
solid
hop
bitterness
the
malt
presence
is
detectable
mainly
bittersweet
and
very
subtle
roast
but
certainly
is
second
fiddle
to
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
the
beer
finishes
with
lingering
nutty
malt
and
citrusypiny
hop
flavor
especially
as
it
warms
the
carbonation
and
body
are
both
moderate
overall
a
solid
offering
could
there
be
tweaks
to
make
it
incredible
like
a
tad
more
body
sure
but
i
wont
complain
not
bad
poured
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
decent
tan
head
that
lasts
a
little
whie
and
good
lace
color
is
perhaps
clear
to
slightly
hazy
depending
on
the
width
of
the
glass
and
a
dark
garnet
aroma
is
hop
malt
dark
ripe
fruit
roast
flavors
somewhat
like
nose
where
i
pick
up
those
qualities
but
also
a
whole
set
of
complementary
characteristics
as
well
a
bit
smoke
fairly
dry
good
carbonic
tang
earth
body
is
odd
but
good
and
carbonation
is
spot
on
finishis
is
like
flavor
a
little
long
and
astringent
really
wish
they
sold
this
beer
in
6
packs
i
absolutely
love
their
take
on
the
iba
this
beer
hit
the
spot
i
will
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
more
of
this
beer
they
are
definitely
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
pack
in
this
style
in
my
book
black
with
some
visible
light
passing
through
small
head
but
decent
lacing
aroma
is
a
combination
of
piney
hops
and
licorice
decent
amount
of
carbonation
gives
it
a
lively
mouthfeel
flavor
is
a
good
balance
between
the
spicycitrusy
hops
and
the
molasses
tinged
sweetness
nice
bittersweet
finish
overy
drinkable
and
refreshing
for
the
style
i
take
it
almost
as
a
lite
beer
in
as
nice
a
way
as
possible
it
could
have
gone
farther
which
might
mean
more
abv
feels
like
they
were
trying
to
make
sure
the
combined
beer
style
would
go
together
very
well
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
given
the
profile
and
flavor
they
did
a
great
job
with
this
one
definitely
worth
trying
but
dont
expect
an
aggressive
approach
the
more
i
got
through
the
bomber
the
more
i
started
to
enjoy
it
and
the
flavors
and
aroma
started
to
show
lfb
is
in
my
back
yard
and
reasonably
priced
will
be
having
some
more
reviewed
on
03122011
193422
o
a
bit
uneven
in
spots
but
still
worth
a
look
drinkable
hoping
this
will
keep
up
the
streak
of
lakefronts
22oz
bottles
being
far
better
than
their
core
lineup
minus
the
ipa
and
fixed
gear
which
they
just
deservedly
started
putting
in
sixers
pours
a
nice
deep
brown
color
with
two
fingers
of
offwhite
head
aroma
is
full
of
citrus
hops
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
in
the
back
the
taste
is
very
good
its
got
a
very
strong
hop
presence
that
separates
this
from
the
hoppy
porters
of
the
world
with
some
highly
roasted
malts
and
coffee
providing
a
bitter
supporting
role
the
mouthfeel
is
very
ipalike
with
just
a
bit
more
body
than
the
average
one
would
have
and
the
drinkability
is
very
good
another
great
one
from
lakefront
if
they
keep
putting
out
great
new
beers
they
are
going
to
go
places
in
the
craft
world
o
very
nice
beer
good
example
of
the
black
bitter
beer
whatever
you
want
to
name
it
tasted
in
series
with
my
homebrewed
bipa
and
this
is
the
beer
id
like
mine
to
be
o
a
really
good
black
ipa
and
an
exquisitely
balanced
one
at
that
perhaps
the
fastestgrowing
beer
style
to
date
the
american
black
ale
lakefront
did
not
play
aroundblack
as
black
with
a
killer
lacing
slight
roast
in
the
nose
with
a
thick
blanket
of
soft
hop
resin
and
faint
ripe
fruit
minty
and
tobacco
aroma
moderatesized
body
more
than
enough
smoothness
to
go
around
smacks
of
hops
but
with
a
smat
tering
of
roasted
grain
and
ripe
fruit
this
beer
is
more
complex
than
just
darkness
and
hops
the
hops
do
however
provide
a
pretty
intense
trail
for
the
taste
buds
to
follow
minty
hop
finish
with
some
lingering
roastiness
the
brewer
definitely
has
a
firm
grasp
on
this
style
overall
a
very
solid
beer
wonderful
balance
of
floral
hops
and
coffee
grounds
i
didnt
think
those
two
flavors
would
be
compatible
but
lakefront
brewery
seems
to
have
mastered
it
a
unique
and
outstanding
beer
have
to
admit
i
was
ready
to
jump
on
the
oxymoron
bandwagon
didnt
think
i
was
gonna
like
this
but
i
do
i
do
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
friends
and
for
the
price
5bomber
you
cant
beat
it
overall
one
of
the
better
examples
of
this
new
style
that
ive
had
drinkable
crisp
the
hops
brighten
it
but
the
flavor
are
a
little
muddied
giving
a
sense
that
this
was
close
to
being
a
top
tier
beer
but
just
missed
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
worth
trying
there
is
something
about
the
flavor
that
is
odd
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
though
maybe
its
the
spiciness
still
pretty
tasty
though
it
is
not
bad
but
feels
like
something
is
missing
perhaps
a
bit
more
malts
and
hops
as
it
all
feels
a
little
watered
down
finally
got
the
chance
to
try
this
one
very
dark
pour
with
a
good
creamy
head
to
finish
it
off
the
malty
aroma
and
taste
kept
the
hops
from
becoming
overpowering
this
was
a
very
smooth
beer
the
hopsmalt
combination
in
this
beer
made
for
a
very
pleasant
offering
from
lakefront
mouth
and
taste
this
beer
has
a
crisp
mouth
feel
to
it
the
smokiness
of
the
beer
comes
trough
with
the
taste
as
well
as
the
mild
hoppiness
d
a
decent
nose
to
it
but
light
on
the
flavor
intensity
though
the
sweet
light
toastiness
with
hints
of
molasses
and
pine
is
a
great
flavor
profile
very
good
and
very
drinkable
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
do
love
black
ipas
and
wasnt
disappointed
to
say
the
least
cheers
o
would
make
a
great
morning
beer
i
am
going
to
buy
a
six
pack
wonderful
maybe
these
beers
are
available
in
smaller
bottles
but
ive
only
ever
been
able
to
find
the
large
650
ml
bottles
this
is
a
beer
i
would
rather
take
in
12
oz
increments
very
good
worth
trying
i
really
like
this
style
whatever
they
decide
the
name
will
be
and
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
unfortunately
this
is
lacking
the
complexity
the
style
requires
to
pull
it
off
you
need
an
ipa
and
a
dark
flavor
component
to
both
present
themselves
in
time
but
this
was
one
dimensional
throughout
it
was
drinkable
but
the
flavors
seemed
muddled
and
muted
to
me
lakefront
iba
indiastyle
black
ale
combines
smoky
chocolaty
porter
qualities
with
a
wet
autumn
leafslike
hoppiness
to
make
for
a
beer
that
is
as
multifaceted
as
it
is
drinkable
it
combines
the
most
agreeable
aspects
of
dark
beers
and
hoppy
beers
into
a
one
lipsmacking
ale
if
the
style
is
new
to
you
this
wisconsin
offering
is
a
good
place
to
start
out
poured
out
like
a
porter
almost
the
head
was
creamy
tan
in
color
and
the
beer
itself
was
a
dark
brown
the
head
on
the
beer
leaves
a
pretty
good
lacing
down
the
glass
the
smell
isnt
overly
hoppy
or
anything
its
got
some
roasted
malts
in
the
back
ground
the
taste
is
nice
its
got
a
pretty
decent
amount
of
hops
and
malts
working
together
the
mouthfeel
was
nicely
carbonated
and
had
a
good
drinkability
for
the
most
part
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
not
the
best
black
ipa
out
there
but
worth
checking
out
one
very
solid
ibaaba
by
lakefront
this
is
something
they
should
be
doing
more
often
with
their
future
brews
and
this
iba
is
exactly
where
one
opens
doors
for
such
a
thing
to
happen
overall
for
me
it
seemed
a
bit
muted
a
bit
muffled
and
just
held
back
from
its
potential
in
terms
of
malts
the
hop
flavor
and
even
the
body
the
flavor
actually
brings
the
black
malt
out
finally
good
balance
and
drinkability
although
not
terribly
adventurous
a
bit
light
although
the
ease
of
enjoyment
is
quite
high
herbal
hops
include
notes
of
citrus
and
menthol
patent
malt
finish
is
nice
with
a
slight
cola
note
o
tasty
ipa
with
a
roasty
twist
high
drinkability
due
to
the
balanced
sweet
malts
and
bittering
hops
recommended
b
o
this
is
a
good
beer
ive
been
on
a
bit
of
a
black
ale
kick
lately
and
the
coincidence
of
the
style
showing
up
in
this
variety
pack
is
a
welcome
thing
for
a
monday
this
is
the
third
of
the
four
that
ive
had
from
the
88
sampler

that
was

retained
and
dissipated
into
a
small

that
lasted
throughout
the
beer
the
beer
gave
off
a
nice
pine

aroma
the
beer
had
a
nice
more
of
a
roasted
malty
taste
than
expected
but
with
citrus
hops
to
note
seemed
pretty
straight
forward
the
beer
had
a
medium
feel
to
it
with
a
nice
dry
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
will
probably
buy
again
drinkability

thanks
for

this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
i
wouldnt
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
greats
but
it
was
a
good
deal
when
the
four
pack
was
only
16
aroma
is
rather
hoppy
and
has
a
yeasty
undertone
it
pours
a
barely
transparent
chocolate
brown
with
a
respectable
if
not
persistent
beige
head
flavor
is
hoppy
slightly
bitter
slightly
honeysweet
with
a
smoky
hint
texture
is
fairly
smooth
a
teensy
thin
and
only
a
little
bit
fizzy
overall
nothing
special
but
not
too
shabby
and
worth
a
try
d
solid
by
example
hoppy
fairly
smooth
stouty
impression
at
first
dominant
black
roasted
malt
with
lingering
herbal
bitterness
and
citrus
rind
the
dark
roastiness
and
citrus
peel
bitterness
mesh
well
finishing
clean
and
dry
the
hop
bitterness
lingers
momentarily
in
the
aftertaste
as
do
the
roasty
elements
best
at
room
temperature
the
body
is
lighter
yet
the
stouty
roast
malts
give
it
some
heft
id
really
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
of
this
as
it
has
potential
though
falls
a
bit
short
of
the
genius
claimed
on
the
label
o
nice
offering
cant
say
that
im
wowed
by
this
one
but
i
like
it
im
excited
to
try
some
more
black
ipas
in
the
future
d
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
very
well
balanced
brew
i
think
this
could
very
easily
be
a
daily
drinker
i
would
stock
it
as
such
in
my
fridge
anyways
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
o
drinkability
is
very
good
hops
and
malts
balanced
well
and
both
in
play
nicely
the
mustyearthy
factor
is
not
appealing
to
me
3
5
like
many
craft
breweries
lakefront
is
all
over
the
map
when
it
comes
to
quality
holiday
spice
lager
riverwest
stein
beer
and
ipa
on
the
top
end
pumpkin
ale
and
cherry
lager
on
the
bottom
end
iba
is
almost
as
good
as
ipa
which
makes
me
glad
that
its
available
locally
picked
up
a
bomber
from
abes
for
4
50
and
split
it
with
a
fellow
hophead
gotta
say
while
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
it
doesnt
stand
out
i
feel
like
ive
had
this
beer
before
from
other
brewers
the
beer
is
dominated
by
a
dry
spicy
cocoa
malt
and
citrus
hops
mixture
thats
satisfying
but
could
be
deeper
it
comes
in
a
big
flavor
hit
instead
of
slowly
developing
from
start
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
expected
but
it
had
adequate
carbonation
just
a
bit
hollow
another
impressive
beer
from
lakefront
in
fact
this
is
one
of
the
few
black
ipas
to
successfully
marry
the
elements
of
a
good
porter
and
a
good
ipa
together
well
done
d
not
bad
i
like
the
mouthfeel
and
theres
little
abv
presence
the
smell
and
taste
are
a
bit
straightfoward
and
basic
d
very
drinkable
perhaps
dangerously
so
a
6
5
abv
drinkability
50
ibus
a
medium
body
and
tons
of
hops
make
this
brew
a
great
way
to
end
the
night
im
a
big
fan
of
lakefront
and
the
beers
dont
come
any
fresher
than
here
in
milwaukee
but
this
one
leaves
something
to
be
desired
ill
say
again
that
by
no
means
is
iba
a
style
im
an
expert
inon
the
contrary
this
is
my
firstbut
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
little
counterproductive
maybe
its
an
aquired
taste
ill
just
have
one
more
bottle
finish
malty
hops
stick
around
for
a
bit
not
sure
if
ive
had
any
lakefront
beers
in
the
past
but
this
one
caught
my
eye
at
argonaut
liquors
the
other
night
maybe
the
5
price
tag
poured
a
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
good
three
fingers
of
khaki
head
on
top
good
hoppy
aromas
up
front
grapefruit
orange
pine
followed
by
some
roasted
malt
medium
bodied
with
flavors
of
roasted
malt
chocolate
and
earthy
hops
d
easy
and
satisfying
drinker
no
problem
grabbing
more
of
this
around
town
this
beer
pours
brilliantly
clear
very
dark
brown
with
a
mahogany
glow
when
held
to
a
light
and
a
sticky
thick
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
highly
hoppy
mainly
citrus
pine
and
floral
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
strong
hop
flavorpine
and
citrus
zest
with
solid
hop
bitterness
the
malt
presence
is
detectable
mainly
bittersweet
and
very
subtle
roast
but
certainly
is
second
fiddle
to
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
and
the
beer
finishes
with
lingering
nutty
malt
and
citrusypiny
hop
flavor
especially
as
it
warms
the
carbonation
and
body
are
both
moderate
overall
a
solid
offering
could
there
be
tweaks
to
make
it
incredible
like
a
tad
more
body
sure
but
i
wont
complain
the
pure
milwaukee
genius
of
lakefront
brewery
strikes
again
a
very
pleasant
black
ipa
with
great
drinkability
this
brew
is
a
very
nice
balance
of
hops
citrus
earthy
and
is
lead
by
some
outstanding
roast
dark
malts
unique
and
adventerous
good
brew
from
lakefront
d
sky
high
in
drinkability
goes
down
easily
and
is
very
satisfying
i
could
see
myself
finishing
off
two
bombers
without
a
problem
this
is
a
beer
that
would
work
well
year
round
not
overly
heavy
for
summer
drinking
but
still
packs
enough
body
and
flavor
to
work
in
cold
weather
well
done
up
there
with
ipa
in
terms
of
flavor
and
drinkability
the
mouthfeel
has
an
overall
airiness
but
gains
enough
traction
in
the
mouth
to
give
itself
substance
and
definition
its
on
the
low
side
alcoholwise
of
the
style
and
drinkability
is
without
a
doubt
its
strong
suit
its
assertive
in
its
flavor
but
not
aggressive
hoppy
but
balanced
basically
its
a
hoppedup
brown
ale
even
though
thats
not
the
trendy
way
to
label
it
regardless
its
got
some
charm
and
its
damn
drinkable
id
like
to
see
this
in
sixpacks
as
it
demands
that
sort
of
mass
consumption
taste
roasty
malt
and
hops
simple
flavors
but
its
tasty
stuff
i
could
drink
glass
after
glass
of
this
all
night
long
d
definitely
a
solid
black
ipa
not
overly
bitter
or
hopped
has
a
nice
feel
and
smoothness
to
it
well
done
lakefront
i
am
keeping
in
mind
that
this
is
inaugural
release
i
am
confident
that
by
this
time
next
year
lakefront
will
have
worked
out
the
kinks
in
this
recipe
and
i
will
be
editing
this
review
to
reflect
a
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
with
pride
it
was
more
of
a
dark
reddish
color
than
an
ipa
and
the
taste
was
not
what
you
would
expect
from
and
ipa
medium
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
not
the
best
representation
style
its
a
good
beer
but
it
certainly
does
not
seem
like
a
black
ipa
must
try
original
if
you
like
your
beers
masculine
one
of
the
best
in
a
favorite
style
by
and
large
the
best
thing
is
how
it
looks
but
thats
really
not
a
compliment
dark
with
a
nice
light
head
the
smell
was
okay
with
a
bit
of
yeast
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
the
hops
the
taste
was
okay
with
a
bit
of
pine
and
then
a
clean
finish
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
forgettable
to
be
honest
for
a
black
ipa
its
very
good
but
then
again
its
not
a
style
i
point
out
to
others
that
often
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
give
it
a
try
and
you
might
be
surprised
others
may
want
to
try
something
else
first
im
going
to
let
this
warm
up
but
as
of
now
it
leaves
much
to
be
desired
this
is
my
issue
with
cans
its
too
cold
to
taste
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
a
black
ipa
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
but
i
found
myself
wishing
that
the
malts
were
more
rich
bolder
and
roasty
and
i
thought
the
hop
profile
could
have
been
a
little
more
complex
and
impart
more
hoppy
flavors
but
its
far
from
the
worst
black
ipa
and
i
would
say
that
as
a
whole
its
pretty
solid
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
that
it
was
fairly
true
to
style
and
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
the
hops
and
malts
werent
bolder
i
think
they
were
both
a
little
weaker
then
they
should
be
i
might
buy
a
can
of
this
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
black
ipa
and
i
would
for
sure
buy
another
one
if
i
knew
it
was
really
fresh
i
would
recommend
giving
this
a
try
if
you
like
black
ipas
but
i
dont
think
its
a
stand
out
in
the
style
all
in
all
i
thought
this
beer
was
solid
it
wasnt
the
best
or
the
worse
of
the
style
but
it
didnt
have
any
off
flavors
or
anything
that
was
too
far
off
for
the
style
nice
job
guys
keep
up
the
solid
work
on
the
whole
this
one
was
weird
not
bad
but
not
quite
what
id
call
an
ipa

ba
imperial
black
ipa
from
uinta
maybe
that
is
just
unfair
i
mean
it
is
okay
but
nothing
special
flat
no
malty
sweetness
no
hops
to
speak
of
minimal
head
and
lacing
kind
of
bland
not
saying
it
is
not
a
drinker
it
does
go
down
rather
smooth
with
no
noticeable
characteristics
thats
the
problem
it
is
just
too
middle
of
the
road
which
should
appeal
to
those
who
like
bland
beers
just
wont
be
on
my
buy
list
again
o
hmm
no
quality
issues
just
not
a
delicious
beer
nice
perfumey
hoppy
nose
but
the
flavour
is
dry
and
boring
black
ipa
surely
its
just
a
porter
not
the
best
offering
ive
had
from
this
brewery
ohas
a
great
mix
of
hops
and
roasted
malt
that
does
not
overpower
you
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
o
this
beer
drinks
very
easily
although
it
seemed
like
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
a
little
stronger
love
this
one
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
roasted
malt
with
some
chocolate
and
hop
aromas
roasted
malt
chocolate
hop
caramel
citrus
and
pine
flavors
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
roasted
malt
and
lightly
sweet
hop
finish
a
very
good
beer
intense
floral
hop
aroma
pours
black
almost
entirely
opaque
with
a
thin
white
head
leaving
behind
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
piney
hops
malt
character
shows
up
more
as
it
warms
roasty
with
some
caramel
notes
finishes
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
very
dry
finish
the
beer
itself
is
very
good
and
great
to
drink
but
doesnt
stand
out
much
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
where
there
are
arguably
too
many
ipas
if
such
a
state
is
possible
this
was
a
disappointing
offering
first
of
all
i
love
ipas
but
ive
only
had
a
few
black
ipas
second
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
tasted
more
like
a
porter
than
an
ipa
smell
was
dark
with
a
slight
hop
aroma
taste
was
smokey
like
a
porter
and
never
tasted
any
hops
the
aftertaste
was
the
worst
it
was
slick
oily
and
tart
22oz
bottle
dated
jun
03

served
in
pint
glass
beer
pours
actually
more
brown
than
black
though
totally
opaque
in
the
glass
with
a
medium
foamy
chestnut
head
aroma
is
decent
but
more
big
malt
brew
than
ipa
like
a
brown
ale
or
even
a
coffee
stout
flavor
confirms
it
roasty
nutty
flavors
with
a
strong
mocha
flavor
like
an
overly
fizzy
chocolate
stout
besides
the
fizziness
it
has
the
thinner
mouthfeel
of
an
ipa
too
but
not
to
say
that
this
brew
is
too
sweet
i
really
dont
get
any
particular
hop
character
to
call
this
an
ipa
is
a
sham
beeradvocate
calls
it
american
black
ale
but
this
is
no
cda
either
still
its
decently
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
even
if
it
misses
the
style
guidelines
serving
type
bottle
well
not
quite
pitchblack
but
fairly
close
some
ruby
highlights
and
a
tan
head
thats
quite
sizable
and
holds
its
own
very
nice
lacing
not
too
much
on
the
nose
some
malty
pine
woodsy
charcoal
a
bit
of
grapefruit
for
a
black
ipa
it
is
very
drinkable
more
pine
and
citrus
some
smokiness
and
malt
theres
a
bit
of
an
oily
feel
mild
carbonation
heavier
than
i
anticipated
very
reasonable
price
for
a
bomber
at
4
99
and
one
id
gladly
get
again
if
for
anything
to
look
at
the
great
designs
in
the
lacing
a
cat
a
whale
three
cyclopes
dancing
arminarm
very
tasty
beer
o
an
interesting
ipa
mixed
with
a
dark
beer
o
this
is
what
id
recommend
to
people
when
wanting
to
try
a
black
ipa
this
is
a
very
solid
brew
that
is
sessionable
when
you
want
the
darker
side
of
malts
and
roasted
flavor
with
a
good
hop
balance
interesting
brew
sort
of
joins
the
worlds
of
ipas
and
stoutsporters
i
dont
really
know
if
it
was
a
bridge
that
needed
to
be
built
though
usually
when
i
drink
an
ipa
im
not
in
it
for
the
maltyness
and
when
i
drink
a
stout
im
not
there
for
hops
a
good
beer
but
a
good
beer
with
no
home
this
is
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favourite
styles
not
the
best
example
ive
had
but
a
solid
offering
and
a
welcome
surprise
on
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
ocean
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
color
was
a
mostly
opaque
black
with
a
thick
1
finger
light
brown
head
a
fair
bit
of
cling
on
the
sides
aroma
was
a
roasted
grain
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
in
the
back
bits
of
lactose
alternated
with
a
bitter
smell
flavor
was
roasted
grain
with
a
bit
of
burnt
lactose
as
time
went
on
the
burnt
got
a
bit
stronger
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
very
well
without
being
overly
sticky
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
special
watery
and
not
hopped
enough
for
a
cda
plays
almost
like
a
hoppy
schwarzbier
heard
widmer
was
the
best
of
the
cba
this
is
a
disappointment
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
black
ipas
always
surprise
me
even
though
i
know
what
to
expect
its
like
that
purple
colored
ketchup
tastes
like
ketchup
but
it
just
looks
weird
nice
hop
profile
and
a
good
balance
with
the
roasted
malts
definitely
a
better
brew
than
i
was
expecting
o
i
was
going
to
give
this
an
average
score
as
i
jotted
down
the
review
on
paper
but
as
i
began
typing
it
up
the
beer
warmed
and
i
found
myself
liking
it
more
and
more
this
is
the
4th
and
final
bottle
out
of
the
4
pack
the
1st
was
such
a
disappointment
that
i
drain
poored
it
the
2nd
was
ok
the
3rd
good
and
the
4th
ended
up
being
pretty
damn
tasty
im
glad
i
caught
it
at
the
perfect
temp
and
decided
not
to
review
it
until
now
time
to
got
turn
the
thermostat
down
on
my
fridge
o
pretty
good
combines
styles
well
not
much
of
a
malt
profile
for
a
pitch
black
ipa
wouldve
expected
some
roasted
notes
or
at
least
something
in
the
darker
category
for
a
fan
of
the
dark
cascadians
this
beer
left
me
wanting
on
that
subject
otherwise
this
beer
was
good
and
i
would
drink
again
but
cannot
say
i
would
choose
it
over
some
of
the
other
options
out
there
i
look
forward
to
more
brews
coming
out
of
the
widmer
brothers
operation
o
well
this
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
wasnt
impressed
with
it
either
the
mouthfeel
sort
of
killed
it
for
me
there
are
probably
better
black
ipas
out
there
no
memorable
qualities
come
to
mind
for
this
beer
and
i
doubt
ill
remember
it
for
too
long
35
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
well
this
beer
turned
out
especially
as
it
was
not
at
what
id
call
a
bargain
for
a
4
pack
kudos
to
the
brewer
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
just
dont
think
it
has
quite
enough
hop
character
in
it
to
truly
be
an
ipa
i
think
it
tastes
more
like
a
strong
porter
with
slightly
more
hops
in
it
than
normal
still
good
nonetheless
and
it
will
stay
on
my
list
of
beers
id
like
to
have
again
o
back
and
forth
on
this
one
one
sip
is
ehh
but
then
the
next
is
pretty
good
then
there
is
that
bad
pill
taste
in
general
probably
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
pours
a
very
dark
brown
appearing
black
in
the
glass
with
a
half
finger
light
tan
head
with
decent
retention
aroma
was
piney
hops
with
light
toasted
malt
flavor
follows
with
light
pine
and
citrus
hops
and
toasted
malt
light
singed
coffee
a
fairly
understated
black
ale
but
maybe
ive
been
spoiled
by
black
ipas
light
to
medium
bodied
a
satisfactory
black
ale
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
overall
this
was
better
than
expected
better
than
other
black
ipas
i
have
tried
overall
a
pretty
decent
dark
ipa
it
has
a
good
hop
and
roast
flavors
while
not
the
best
out
there
as
its
transitions
and
complementation
of
the
roast
sweet
and
hop
flavors
are
not
always
smooth
it
does
have
decent
individual
flavors
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
the
hop
freshness
through
the
taste
the
nose
however
was
comparatively
weak
following
in
the
taste
we
wished
there
was
a
better
balance
throughout
as
we
felt
the
malts
were
underdeveloped
and
the
hops
were
left
without
any
real
good
match
overall
i
like
certain
things
about
this
beer
but
it
seemed
a
bit
light
and
watery
on
the
palate
i
have
enjoyed
more
of
this
when
on
draft
but
will
still
drink
in
a
bottle
o
ok
let
me
say
im
not
a
big
hop
head
and
this
beer
is
not
over
the
top
hoppy
but
a
little
on
the
sticky
hoppy
side
a
good
representative
for
a
black
ipa
if
you
like
black
ipa
give
this
one
a
try
real
nice
nose
on
this
one
has
that
fruity
tone
to
it
youd
expect
from
the
style
flavor
is
pretty
good
though
it
doesnt
really
live
up
to
the
fragrance
at
all
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
really
bringing
a
mass
of
complexity
just
hits
ya
in
the
mouth
and
its
good
just
not
overly
memorable
overall
its
very
nicei
happily
order
this
again
looks
a
bit
like
cola
almost
opaque
brown
with
a
thin
head
sandy
white
in
color
nice
to
see
a
blac
ipa
that
looks
more
like
an
ipa
as
opposed
to
a
stout
that
happens
to
be
hoppy
the
aroma
is
like
chocolate
covered
hops
rich
ganache
with
a
hint
of
coffee
citrus
honey
and
lavender
a
touch
of
dark
raisiny
fruit
is
there
as
well
making
this
a
nice
balancing
act
between
the
malts
and
the
hops
a
nice
sprightly
carbonation
keeps
this
pretty
easy
to
drink
in
spite
of
its
rich
flavours
as
does
an
overall
dryness
the
general
impression
is
one
of
balance
there
are
some
good
juicy
citrictropical
hop
flavours
here
but
they
share
the
stage
with
the
chocolatey
kind
of
licoricey
flavours
of
the
malts
this
isnt
a
beer
that
has
me
totally
engrossed
in
its
nuance
but
it
is
a
damn
tasty
sipper
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
its
an
easy
beer
to
sit
and
drink
while
not
ruining
the
palate
and
providing
solid
flavors
roasted
charred
bitterness
up
front
coffee
and
dark
chocolate
malts
settle
in
with
a
meaty
smoky
edge
slightly
fruity
herbal
piny
minty
hops
complement
the
malt
nicely
a
little
spicy
a
little
drier
in
the
finish
with
lingering
charred
malts
medium
body
with
a
slightly
creamy
feel
a
nice
black
ipa
pours
very
dark
nearly
black
really
smells
great
i
grabbed
a
couple
of
bottles
of
this
at
a
nearby
store
and
was
really
looking
forward
to
it
its
not
a
bad
beer
malty
and
hoppy
all
at
once
with
a
really
nice
roasty
taste
to
it
but
i
felt
like
there
was
something
missing
from
it
the
flavor
was
a
bit
too
smooth
something
was
just
not
quite
there
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
quite
a
great
one
either
certainly
worth
a
try
though
i
enjoyed
it
and
probably
will
again
no
weaknesses
here
poured
on
tap
at
the
j
clyde
in
june
2011
pours
a
flat
black
color
that
eats
up
the
light
with
a
very
moderate
chestnut
tones
at
the
edges
of
the
glass
creamy
khaki
head
with
decent
lacing
overall
the
nose
was
light
on
hops
mostly
pine
and
lemons
and
heavy
on
the
roasted
malt
the
tast
was
full
of
oily
hops
very
pine
driven
and
low
key
on
the
malt
more
the
opposite
of
the
nose
which
was
a
little
off
for
me
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
maybe
could
have
produced
a
more
harmonious
interaction
between
malt
and
hop
overall
not
big
on
the
pine
hop
character
but
the
citrus
is
there
to
keep
it
in
check
great
malthop
balance
for
a
cda
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
but
a
standout
amongst
its
contemporaries
in
a
fairly
new
style
of
beer
overall
this
one
was
a
little
more
on
the
stout
side
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
it
still
had
some
nice
hop
bitterness
but
only
during
the
aftertaste
id
also
like
a
little
more
of
a
grapefruit
presence
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
have
again
its
a
tad
astringent
but
mostly
okay
medium
body
and
carbonation
with
a
moderately
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
i
would
probably
try
it
again
however
really
enjoyed
this
beer
would
love
to
pick
up
some
more
my
favorite
part
of
this
brew
is
the
way
it
feels
in
your
mouth
the
carbonation
is
smooth
with
small
bubbles
but
adds
a
nice
crisp
texture
to
the
brew
also
the
hops
have
a
nice
presence
here
with
a
clean
bitterness
balanced
by
the
sweeter
malts
a
really
good
beer
and
a
great
cheap
find
at
costco
well
worth
checking
out
thank
you
sir
may
i
have
another
o
this
one
is
a
genre
bender
never
heard
of
a
black
ipa
before
i
like
it
it
isnt
an
over
hopped
stout
or
a
burnt
tasting
ipa
unique
and
tasty
overall
for
me
this
is
more
like
a
black
ipa
hoppy
with
roasted
malt
as
oppose
to
a
roasted
malt
beer
with
hop
notes
somewhere
in
the
background
overall
i
am
not
overly
familiar
with
a
black
ipa
listed
here
as
an
american
black
ale
this
has
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hop
both
in
ample
quantities
purchased
a
4pack
on
closeout
for
3
well
worth
that
price
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
smoother
than
a
lot
of
american
black
ales
in
that
there
isnt
a
lot
of
tannic
bitterness
from
the
malt
a
really
good
effort
and
something
i
will
pick
up
again
yet
another
nice
find
at
the
world
of
beers
in
fort
myers
florida
this
black
ipa
has
a
solid
black
color
with
a
big
tan
layer
of
thick
bubbles
on
top
and
really
impressive
lacing
the
nose
detects
piney
hop
delight
with
citrus
edges
and
just
a
touch
of
swampy
malt
very
much
what
the
doctor
ordered
the
flavor
offers
a
minty
pineherbalcitrus
medley
of
hop
goodness
with
a
touch
of
bread
pudding
sweetness
its
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
midland
feel
that
includes
a
healthy
carbonation
a
very
solid
black
ipa
that
i
enjoyed
pours
a
deep
amber
to
black
in
color
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
citrus
hops
and
a
mellow
grapefuity
citrus
in
the
taste
mellow
citrus
hops
and
a
small
roast
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
hop
and
roast
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
hop
presence
with
a
small
roast
presence
quite
smooth
and
nice
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
nearly
opaque
dark
brown
color
with
one
finger
of
khakicolored
head
the
retention
was
good
and
it
left
lacing
in
chunks
and
then
later
bands
the
aroma
was
of
toasted
and
roasted
malt
anise
molasses
balanced
with
pine
grass
and
resiny
hops
the
flavors
were
quite
enjoyable
and
appropriate
for
the
style
i
tasted
all
the
elements
from
the
aroma
with
the
roasted
malt
and
sweet
notes
being
in
harmony
with
the
bitter
elements
of
the
piney
hops
well
balanced
and
i
really
enjoyed
the
light
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
that
filled
out
and
added
to
the
traditional
ipa
flavor
profile
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
mediumfull
and
the
carbonation
soft
a
very
good
example
of
an
american
black
aleblack

ale

if
youve
never
tried
one

it
is
a
little
more
pricey

recommend
picking
up
a
fourpack
o
a
great
great
black
ipa
and
a
personal
favorite
in
the
style
if
you
would
like
to
explore
the
newfound
world
of
black
ipas
seek
this
one
out
if
youre
a
hophead
i
would
recommend
trying
it
if
you
see
it
not
for
the
new
pretty
complex
stuff
pours
a
pitch
black
color
with
a
slight
but
quickly
disappearing
head
but
with
rather
good
lacing
only
scent
im
able
to
pick
out
are
hops
yet
the
scent
is
rather
mild
the
texture
is
quite
full
and
thick
first
you
get
a
taste
of
chalky
malts
and
robust
flavors
which
turn
into
a
crisp
bitter
finish
great
overall
taste
a
highly
drinkable
a
rather
good
and
reasonable
sipping
beer
a
very
complex
and
worthwhile
beer
especially
if
you
want
the
best
of
both
worlds
a
dark
stoutish
beer
with
ipa
hoppiness
this
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
the
head
was
foamy
looking
and
had
a
tan
color
to
it
the
smell
of
the
beer
gave
off
some
lively
hops
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
roasted
malts
underneath
that
the
taste
was
fairly
well
balanced
i
thought
between
the
citrusy
hops
with
the
roasted
malts
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
sharp
and
yet
smooth
at
the
same
time
overall
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
pretty
good
and
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
someday
o
solid
beer
right
here
these
portland
hipsters
know
how
to
do
their
brews
taste
a
little
toasty
malt
on
the
front
end
with
sweet
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
on
the
back
end
the
beer
has
a
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
has
a
solid
malt
back
bone
to
balance
the
hops
over
all
a
great
shot
at
the
style
definitely
worth
a
try
and
comes

earthy
malty
and
tasty
but
ehnot
the
sort
of
thing
im
going
to
turn
to
again
and
again
just
doesnt
thrill
me
i
hope
this
fad
dies
off
soon
actually
o
disappointing
compared
to
all
the
other
solid
black
ipas
on
the
market
this
one
doesnt
measure
up
its
closer
to
a
roasty
porter
than
an
ipa
not
crazy
about
it
i
do
not
recommend
this
and
thats
unfortunate
less
of
a
hop
boil
might
help
no
indication
this
is
fresh
hops
but
if
so
the
boil
is
probably
still
off
the
hopping
ruined
it
it
could
have
been
damn
good
get
a
better
brewer
one
who
knows
how
to
use
hops
o
i
like
this
brew
great
flavor
profile
leans
towards
the
hops
but
puts
forth
a
smooth
taste
pours
a
very
dark
brown
with
reddish
edges
and
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
to
a
slight
haze
and
ring
pungent
aromas
of
resinous
hops
coffee
beans
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
more
citrus
and
pine
hops
with
a
lightly
bitter
roasted
malt
profile
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
and
crisp
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
maybe
a
touch
on
the
watery
side
overall
a
very
easydrinking
black
ipa
but
nothing
special
ill
stick
with
sublimely
selfrighteous
appearance
is
black
with
a
thin
tan
head
its
nose
has
resin
hops
roasted
malts
and
some
notes
of
chocolate
the
taste
contains
piney
hops
general
earthiness
malts
and
a
bit
of
black
licorice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
clean
finish
to
it
all
things
considered
a
pretty
good
black
ale
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
imho
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
black
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
dominated
by
hops
taste
is
also
very
hoppy
considerable
bitterness
followed
by
some
roasted
malts
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
overall
i
love
this
style
and
im
definitely
enjoying
this
brew
not
as
thick
and
chewy
as
i
had
expected
but
then
again
this
isnt
a
stout
or
porter
i
see
myself
definitely
drinking
more
of
this
the
overall
vibe
from
this
is
more
of
a
stout
than
a
hopforward
black
ipa
the
balance
is
what
makes
me
say
that
which
i
like
i
just
think
it
could
be
a
little
more
dry
and
bitter
if
you
like
less
malt
flavor
in
your
ipas
you
may
enjoy
this
less
i
like
it
for
what
it
is
which
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
pours
a
slick
bright
black
if
that
makes
sense
with
a
two
inch
sticky
light
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
fluffy
coating
of
film
and
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
pineapple
roasted
chocolate
coffee
and
pine
taste
is
all
all
of
those
with
a
wonderful
balance
nothing
dominates
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
considering
the
look
but
that
helps
with
the
drinkability
plenty
of
life
and
lush
as
apposed
to
dry
this
is
a
very
solid
and
sessionable
black
ipa
date
clearly
marked
oct
10
11
i
have
not
had
many
black
ales
that
lean
towards
the
hops
so
this
was
an
unusual
beer
for
me
i
didnt
find
the
hops
overwhelming
as
it
was
a
smooth
ipa
and
my
taste
buds
detected
some
mild
caramel
and
coffee
undertones
maybe
even
dark
chocolate
i
suppose
it
is
possible
that
i
found
these
tastes
because
i
was
expecting
them
from
a
dark
beer
the
malts
however
are
definitely
subdued
and
it
was
like
a
somewhat
balancedmild
ipa
overall
this
beer
is
very
delicious
and
i
would
buy
this
in
case
quantity
its
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
deep
dark
mahogany
color
under
a
mighty
head
of
dense
beige
foam
zesty
citrus
hop
pale
fruit
and
grass
aroma
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
smooth
nicely
balanced
flavor
giving
hops
the
edge
lots
of
juicy
grapefruit
and
pine
needle
hoppiness
turning
peppery
and
a
little
earthy
sweet
bread
and
mild
char
make
up
the
malt
component
medium
creamy
body
seems
a
bit
undercarbonated
the
bitter
and
the
roast
give
it
a
solid
astringency
solid
overall
though
the
mouthfeel
made
it
feel
heavier
than
it
should
have
overall
its
an
okay
black
ipa
nothing
notable
definitely
one
of
the
weaker
black
ipas
or
american
black
ales
that
i
have
had
the
palate
is
awash
in
a
velvety
blanket
of
molasses
with
a
subtle
hoppy
finish
this
is
a
very
pleasant
quaff
whatever
it
is
called
overall
this
beer
would
be
better
served
on
a
hot
summer
night
bottled
in
october
it
will
have
lost
its
edge
by
then
good
mouthfeel
taste
the
first
sip
is
smoky
in
the
finish
with
a
floral
hop
presence
in
the
front
it
sticks
to
the
glass
nicely
there
are
almost
oak
like
notes
a
woodiness
the
mouth
feel
is
creamy
it
is
not
a
super
hoppy
ipa
but
expresses
good
flavor
the
taste
is
more
like
a
black
lager
o
i
liked
this
one
thought
it
was
pretty
solid
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
in
fact
it
is
a
good
beer
all
things
considered
that
being
said
i
have
had
better
abasbipas
i
will
seek
out
a
fresh
example
appearance
is
dark
pitch
black
nice
smell
is
well
toastymalty
is
that
a
word
seriously
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
clean
and
crisp
leaves
the
mouth
nicely
taste
lovely
malty
with
and
slightly
hoppy
flavor
notes
of
coffee
or
smokey
flavor
overall
this
beer
is
fridge
worthy
enjoy
this
will
go
nicely
with
some
smoked
pork
im
not
sure
why
this
beer
is
9
for
a
4
pack
as
it
isnt
big
it
isnt
bold
and
it
isnt
impressive
perhaps
this
beer
is
a
bit
old
4
months
is
a
long
time
for
an
ipa
but
this
is
just
showed
up
here
so
it
wasnt
available
fresh
pours
very
dark
almost
black
with
a
solid
head
of
foam
the
aroma
is
a
wellbalanced
blend
of
smooth
roasted
amtls
and
floral
resinous
hops
the
flavour
is
just
as
balanced
with
notes
of
dark
fruit
and
cocoa
strong
bitterness
and
citrus
finishes
malty
and
bitter
but
dry
nice
and
easy
drinkable
medium
to
light
bodied
ipa
taste
is
bitter
but
not
like
some
ipas
the
bitterness
is
high
after
swallowing
and
lingersbut
it
is
not
mouthnumbing
the
hoparoma
with
the
citric
lemons
and
grapefruit
combine
well
with
the
light
roasted
taste
of
the
malts
this
is
roasted
but
more
in
a
dark
chocolaty
way
than
coffee
does
that
make
sense
it
is
a
mild
unaggresive
maybe
a
little
acidic
low
burning
roast
and
it
compliments
with
the
bitter
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
this
kind
of
beer
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
overall
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
dark
ale
with
a
nice
hop
aroma
and
flavor
without
a
lot
of
the
harshness
one
might
expect
from
an
ipa
or
aba
good
stuff
well
done
widmer
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
it
toes
the
line
between
black
ipa
and
hoppy
stout
it
does
come
across
a
little
thin
at
times
but
its
balanced
and
smooth
its
worth
looking
into
poured
into
a
standard
pint
a
deep
dark
brown
with
a
one

beige

that
never
really

notesa
damn
good
beer
i
just
wasnt
digging
this
one
that
flat
tasting
green
citrus
flavor
just
controlled
too
much
of
the
taste
here
and
ultimately
made
this
a
fairly
bland
drinking
experience
its
too
bad
to
as
the
nose
showed
some
promise
poured
almost
black
with
a
petite
light
brown
head
leaving
good
lacing
smell
fluttered
on
what
i
would
call
hoppy
but
was
still
dominated
by
the
dark
malt
presence
hops
coming
through
were
mostly
fruity
taste
was
rather
well
balanced
the
hops
came
through
enough
to
give
the
beers
ipa
title
merit
although
that
ipa
title
is
apparently
a
misnomer
i
rather
enjoyed
the
roasted
coffee
like
malt
flavors
that
were
complimented
by
the
fruity
hops
mouthfeel
was
smooth
but
a
bit
oily
easy
recommendation
for
those
who
love
hops
but
have
trouble
with
excessive
bitterness
simple
yet
effective
black
ipas
dont
always
do
it
for
me
but
this
one
has
a
nice
balance
and
drinks
easily
pours
an
opaque
black
with
a
12
inch
tan
head
that
fades
to
an
oily
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
roasted
dark
malt
and
a
pungent
herbal
hop
aroma
taste
is
of
roasted
dark
malts
with
citrus
zest
and
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
also
a
bit
of
a
roasted
coffee
bean
flavor
i
am
picking
up
too
very
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
quickly
fades
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ale
with
a
nice
balance
between
the
roasty
malt
and
the
hop
flavors
o
too
much
roast
and
not
enough
hop
flavor
last
beers
of
the

black

schwing
this
is
a
great
beer
and
i
dont
care
who
you
are
this
beer
pours
pitch
black
with
thin
good
ecru
head
that
is
lacing
nicely
the
smell
includes
fresh
hop
pine
and
subtle

the
taste
starts
as
an
ipa
pine
bitterness
and
a
little
citrus
then
the
after
taste
is
malt
with
a
semi
sweet
kicker
the
mouthfeel
is

i
am
glad
they
didnt
get
too
crazy
with
abv
really
makes
for
a
great
session
ale
good
job
widmer
bros
good
job
o
overall
i
dont
have
much
to
say
about
this
beer
there
is
a
hop
flavor
that
is
cancelled
out
by
a
malt
flavor
resulting
in
really
a
zerosum
beer
yeah
thats
a
bit
of
flavor
but
its
actually
difficult
to
locate
i
honestly
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
beer
its
utter
lack
of
distinction
overall
is
what
makes
it
distinctive
o
a
nicely
balanced
version
of
the
style
this
is
a
black
ipa
that
you
could
go
for
anytime
because
its
cheap
and
readily
available
a
stout
ipa
you
bet
my
favorite
two
beers
on
two
different
levels
come
together
in
some
strange
jungle
fever
way
great
creamy
head
lacing
and
dark
brown
color
looks
like
a
stout
then
wait
give
it
a
whiff
and
its
an
ipa
a
magical
ipa
mellow
easy
on
the
nose
aromas
of
hops
nuts
and
coffee
the
taste
is
light
and
complex
of
hops
coal
metallic
and
a
citrus
nut
after
taste
one
of
the
best
and
strangest
beers
i
have
ever
had
love
these
outside
the
box
beers
my
favorite
that
the
widmer
brothers
make
love
it
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
as
interesting
or
intriguing
as
i
would
have
thought
o
better
than
i
expected
honestly
its
far
from
my
favorite
black
ipa
but
its
definitely
not
bad
reminds
me
much
more
of
a
hoppy
stout
than
a
black
ipa
if
that
makes
any
sense
this
beer
provides
a
real
nice
roasted
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
perhaps
coffee
the
finish
has
a
pleasant
hop
punch
with
lemon
zest
and
grapefruit
flavors
i
also
detect
an
herbal
quality
as
well
a
smooth
and
drinkable
black
ipa
the
nose
features
a
nice
balance
of
roasted
malt
with
pine
floral
and
fruity
hops
fairly
stinging
bitterness
and
sharp
burnt
malt
flavors
make
a
potent
12
combo
the
soft
feel
seems
to
balance
out
the
beer
moreso
than
do
the
light
citrusyfloral
hops
and
a
dash
of
cocoa
a
very
solid
offering
in
the
style
give
it
a
chance
and
you
just
may
be
surprised
mo
very
crisp
and
bubbly
the
beer
has
a
nice
tingle
to
it
which
helps
to
deliver
the
flavors
overall
its
a
very
hoppy
interpretation
of
this
style
but
you
do
get
some
of
the
good
balanced
coffee
aromas
i
expect
from
a
style
like
this
overall
this
is
the
first
black
ipa
ive
had
and
im
not
sure
ill
be
trying
very
hard
to
seek
out
anymore
i
mean
ill
spend
some
time
trying
to
get
other
peoples
opinions
on
what
is
a
good
bench
mark
for
the
style
i
really
hope
they
dont
say
this
one
do
drinks
well
an
overall
pleasant
hoppy
black
ipa

at

fairly
big

another
if

a
good
beer
m
thin

interesting
juxtaposition
of

mildly
in

the

could
see
this
as

for

being
an

imagine
paying
that
much
for
a
4pk
any
time
soon
poured
pitch
black
from
a
bottle
into
a
standard
pint
glass
brown
foam
with
minimal
lacing
in
glass
smooth
bodied
with
full
malt
flavor
thin
mouthfeel
that
was
somewhat
surprising
well
balanced
hops
that
where
citrus
piney
very
mild
bitterness
a
bit
of
a
surprise
on
a
for
a
style
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
would
try
again
with
a
few
other
black
ipas
to
compare
onot
bad
example
of
a
black
ipa
but
many
other
betters
ones
are
on
the
market
though
for
someone
transitioning
from
a
stout
to
ipas
it
might
be
a
good
intro
definitely
has
a
different
look
and
taste
from
most
ipas
i
have
tried
pretty
unique
this
beer
is
pretty
much
what
a
black
ipa
should
be
if
you
added
a
little
more
hops
it
was
very
hoppy
dont
get
me
wrong
but
i
think
it
couldve
used
a
little
more
to
put
it
over
the
top
i
was
impressed
with
the
malt
base
though
it
was
dark
as
it
should
be
but
not
too
roasty
or
harsh
i
picked
up
some
chocolate
to
go
along
with
the
bitter
hops
and
it
finished
nice
and
dry
as
an
ipa
should
a
surprise
find
at
a
bar
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
o
great
brew
this
one
has
about
a
year
on
it
and
is
drinking
wonderfully
no
bitterness
and
all
flavor
wonderful
summer
brew
im
not
an
aba
fan
but
f
they
all
tasted
like
this
one
it
would
be
my
favorite
style
super
unique
happy
4th
of
july
o
okay
beer
last
time
im
likely
to
drink
d
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
however
this
doesnt
really
hit
the
style
profile
taste
and
body
are
more
like
an
english
porter
and
nothing
like
an
ipa
or
cascading
ale
a
tasty
beer
but
not
what
i
had
in
mind
im
a
big
fan
of
black
ipas
but
this
one
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
maybe
im
being
harsh
but
ive
been
enjoying
alot
of
black
ipas
lately
this
one
isnt
worth
the
price
of
admission
taste
just
right
down
the
middle
bitter
hoppy
but
pedestrian
no
major
discernable
flavor
but
no
off
flavor
not
roasty
coffee
chocolate
dont
taste
them
maybe
a
mild
toffeeness
to
it
would
put
the
ibus
around
45
dry
finish
yet
smooth
enough
for
easy
drinking
a
decent
beer
at
a
good
price
kind
of
a
go
to
for
people
new
to
the
black
ale
emerging
phenomenon
the
drinkability
is
relatively
high
this
beer
has
imo
a
great
flavor
profile
a
nice
nose
and
with
6
5
abv
its
got
a
nice
punch
but
still
easily
drinkable
in
small
quantities
if
desired
i
think
its
a
solid
beer
and
id
be
happy
to
have
another
or
pleased
to
share
it
with
a
friend
nothing
real
special
going
on
here
but
this
is
a
well
crafted
and
quite
sessionable
brew
o
i
feel
bad
because
i
got
an
old
bottle
but
this
is
just
bad
not
flavorful
or
interesting
i
dont
understand
why
a
rep
would
give
us
an
old
bottle
when
he
wants
us
to
bring
this
in
i
will
give
this
one
more
try
if
i
find
a
fresher
batch
but
am
hesitant
as
to
the
quality
of
this
beer
regardless
of
age
my
first
from
this
brewery
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
four
pack
good
representation
of
this
style
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
effervescence
aftertaste
is
where
the
malt
is
mpst
noticeable
balancing
the
hops
nicely
this
is
fortunately
not
one
of
those
overhopped
ipas
we
get
so
often
these
day
a
wellrounded
brew
from
start
to
finish
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
jet
black
with
chestnut
highlights
and
a
frothy
skimpy
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
the
nose
is
heavy
of
roasted
maltcaramel
with
steady
hop
presence
citrus
notes
and
a
slight
milk
chocolate
character
flavors
are
smooth
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
coffee
with
a
dark
wet
resinous
hop
profile
that
balances
but
doesnt
overpower
take
a
chocolate
orange
melt
it
in
a
coffee
pot
and
hop
the
shit
out
of
it
slight
bittersweet
aftertaste
with
a
dry
astringent
finish
delicious
overall
its
got
some
punch
to
it
but
its
also
still
fairly
smooth
these
beers
are
going
from
unique
to
hackneyed
in
a
real
hurry
with
every
brewery
racing
to
produce
one
overall
i
didnt
expect
much
from
this
but
remembered
that
i
did
like
their
hefeweizen
so
i
figure
it
would
be
a
good
effort
pleasantly
surprised
with
a
very
drinkable
black
ipa
give
it
a
try
overall
very
enjoyable
black
ipa
i
am
becoming
a
fan
of
this
style
and
this
one
is
definately
a
nice
compliment
to
the
style
lives
up
to
its
name
pours
pitch
black
not
much
head
or
lacing
but
definitely
a
dark
beer
smell
is
pure
hops
huge
amounts
of
grapefruit
and
citrus
not
much
of
a
maltchocolate
smell
at
all
but
i
did
smell
a
little
bit
as
it
warms
up
taste
is
just
like
the
nose
with
the
chocolate
malts
showing
up
more
on
the
finish
but
dominated
by
the
big
hop
flavor
this
is
a
very
hop
forward
black
ipa
if
thats
how
you
like
them
then
this
one
is
a
damn
good
example
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
also
more
reminiscent
of
an
ipa
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
and
just
a
downright
excellent
beer
from
a
brewery
that
doesnt
get
much
credit
these
days
o
not
bad
the
bitterness
overload
from
the
hops
burnt
flavor
at
the
same
time
can
be
a
bit
much
would
go
great
with
some
food
bbq
pretty
light
and
clean
beer
otherwise
probably
the
best
widmer
beer
ive
had
d
id
order
another
and
buy
6
this
is
the
2nd
best
cda
ive
had
to
stone
11th
anniversaryssr
o
i
like
this
its
quite
tasty
good
choice
for
a
cool
spring
evening
where
the
chocolate
keeps
you
warm
and
the
hops
speak
of
the
promise
of
summer
yet
to
come
will
buy
this
again
o
not
bad
at
all
could
have
used
a
bit
more
balance
or
boldness
but
still
nice
pours
a
lovely
opaque
sable
with
a
minimal
head
but
this
may
have
been
an
artifact
of
the
pour
aroma
is
not
strong
but
invitingly
hoppy
with
a
bit
of
a
smoky
hint
flavor
is
hoppy
and
rather
bitter
with
a
malty
undertone
and
just
a
hint
of
unsweet
chocolate
texture
is
fairly
smooth
yet
lively
and
tingly
if
you
like
both
ipas
and
stouts
im
sure
you
will
dig
this
one
better
hop
bite
in
the
taste
but
its
not
up
to
the
ipa
levels
one
would
expect
nice
darker
malt
flavormostly
semisweet
chocolate
appealing
but
thin
bodied
low
carbonation
as
well
two
fingers
of
tan
head
over
a
black
ale
with
brown
edges
good
retention
and
lacing
aromas
are
prominent
and
quite
nice
with
roasty
malts
but
also
distinct
northwestern
hops
florals
to
boot
flavors
fall
a
little
flat
theres
a
metallic
note
underlining
each
flavor
sweet
breadiness
from
the
malt
and
also
roasty
bordering
on
burnt
loved
the
aromas
but
disappointed
in
the
flavors
not
being
more
balanced
m
not
nearly
heavy
enough
and
yet
it
is
too
oily
the
biggest
downfall
of
this
brew
d
very
easy
drink
from
this
black
ipa
goes
down
smooth
and
has
some
nice
flavor
didnt
blow
me
away
but
it
was
solid
nonetheless

seems
a
little
light
as
this
beer
is
packed
full
of
flavor
and
body
while
the
thicker
body
does
detract
from
the
drinkability
slightly
but
nothing
spectacular
as
with
most
widmer
bros
beers
this
one
is
on
the
right
track
but
better
flavored
hops
and
a
more
maltyrich
body
would
compensate
nicely
for
the
aspects
of
the
beer
that
have
unnecessary
bite
and
lack
of
intrigue
i
really
kind
of
enjoy
this
beer
but
am
unsure
how
much
i
would
want
of
this
beer
the
bitterness
is
nice
and
the
dark
malts
provide
a
nice
balance
but
better
examples
of
this
style
exist
d
i
like
it
overall
its
easy
drinking
though
definitely
not
a
stunner
notes
a
decent
aba
but
not
my
favorite
shows
a
little
more
dark
roast
than
i
want
in
a
beer
thats
actually
labeled
black
ipa
just
call
it
a
black
ale
and
it
would
score
a
bit
better
its
certainly
a
step
above
magic
hats
example
but
nowhere
near
the
hill
farmstead
or
stone
examples
ive
had
if
you
dont
want
to
be
socked
in
the
face
by
an
overload
of
citrusy
hops
then
this
will
probably
work
for
you
its
not
blackwatch
but
itll
do
in
a
pinch
good
drinkability
but
it
could
be
more
flavorful
definitely
something
sessionable
for
fans
of
the
black
ipa
maybe
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
still
great
i
like
this
a
lot
this
is
what
most
examples
of
the
style
should
be
probably
the
best
black
ipa
that
i
have
had
something
i
would
recommend
this
is
a
hop
forward
brew
with
a
wellbalanced
toastiness
perfect
for
the
winter
or
cold
weather
pairs
great
with
a
spicy
bean
stew
andor
a
severe
snow
storm
picked
up
a
couple
of
these
in
a
mixed
sixer
at
lukas
a
couple
days
back
poured
jet
black
with
a
mocha
colored
head
aromas
of
piney
hops
and
some
light
roasted
malts
on
the
palate
this
one
is
fairly
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
flavors
of
pine
lightly
roasted
malt
and
coffee
a
very
enjoyable
black
ipa
herbal
peppery
hop
flavors
are
found
as
this
beer
first
hits
my
tongue
and
the
finish
has
a
lingering
pinelike
flavor
citrus
oil
and
grapefruit
zest
linger
on
the
tongue
in
the
long
finish
the
malt
is
a
touch
more
noticeable
in
the
flavor
than
it
was
in
the
nose
this
has
a
smooth
malty
finish
with
some
dark
grain
notes
and
perhaps
even
a
touch
of
cocoa
it
is
interesting
how
the
dark
malt
plays
up
the
herbal
and
hop
pine
flavors
at
least
compared
to
a
standard
ipa
the
body
has
a
certain
creamy
quality
to
it
but
this
is
definitely
a
beer
with
a
good
quaffability
quotient
a
backdrop
of
citrus
and
a
hint
of
lychee
anchor
the
hop
notes
along
with
a
smooth
not
overly
aggressive
bitterness
nice
this
is
definitely
an
enjoyable
brew
d
this
beer
is
not
a
particularly
noteworthy
contribution
to
its
style
but
then
most
others
of
its
peergroup
come
across
as
exceptionally
crafted
brews
while
some
of
the
flavors
detected
here
are
genuinely
interesting
for
the
style
widmer
fails
to
bring
all
of
the
qualities
together
into
a
refined
final
product
a
good
black
ipa
should
in
the
end
be
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
disparate
parts
and
this
one
is
not
a
dark
brown
with
ruby
hues
visible
thin
head
and
minor
to
no

s
some

nonetheless
definitely
drinkable
and
something
ill
pick
up
again
black
or
white
this
is
an
average
ipa
and
an
average
beer
regardless
of
moniker
drinks
like
a
lightly
hopped
black
ale
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
as
a
new
twist
on
one
of
my
perferred
styles
it
is
hard
not
to
compare
this
to
traditional
ipas
but
it
is
a
new
style
by
itself
according
to
the
gabf
i
e
american
style
india
black
ale
or
cascadian
dark
this
would
appear
to
be
a
great
ipa
type
beer
to
drink
during
the
cooler
months
as
it
offers
a
slight
bit
more
character
and
darker
color
than
a
typical
ipa
on
tap
at
the
dig
pub
in
cedar
park
austin
gotta
say
i
was
a
little
skeptical
when
they
told
me
about
this
beer
but
i
decided
to
give
it
a
go
it
looks
like
your
classic
stout
black
w
a
thick
tan
head
however
raising
the
glass
the
first
time
it
smelled
mildly
of
citrus
and
hops
you
know
like
an
ipa
hmmm
tasted
grapefruit
and
moderate
hops
up
front
fading
to
a
piney
character
left
with
moderate
hops
and
possibly
a
mild
roasted
barley
flavor
appearance
skewing
my
perception
will
have
to
try
again
in
fact
im
craving
one
now
pitch
black
is
one
cool
looking
beer
it
smells
like
a
weak
ipa
not
anything
special
but
still
usually
hop
citrus
the
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
and
little
bit
syrupy
like
that
is
okay
but
boring
no
real
taste
from
the
malts
either
this
beer
could
be
better
but
it
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
on
its
own
pours
first
deep
copper
then
goes
to
a
pretty
opaque
black
with
a
frothy
off
white
head
that
leaves
behind
some
minimal
lacing
the
roasted
malt
and
some
small
bit
of
aroma
hops
are
there
on
the
nose
deep
fruit
flavours
and
less
hops
than
i
thought
for
a
black
ipa
they
are
there
but
just
not
in
the
amount
that
i
was
expecting
taste
some
vanilla
and
unfermenters
on
the
after
taste
dont
know
if
any
of
you
homebrew
but
the
after
taste
is
kind
of
the
sweet
taste
of
the
unfermented
wort
just
before
the
yeast
good
not
great
but
a
great
session
beer
if
reviewing
to
style
appearance
score
should
suffer
right
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
awhile
and
i
am
not
disappointed
but
i
am
also
not
overwhelmed
either
the
cascade
hops
are
noticable
on
the
aroma
and
the
taste
juicy
citrus
moreo
f
a
roasted
matliness
than
the
a
burnt
black
malt
bill
it
blends
nicely
finishes
with
a
light
dry
bitterness
on
the
finish
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
beer
and
ill
probably
buy
it
again
but
it
is
not
one
i
sit
here
sipping
and
saying
to
myself
wow
this
is
awesome
good
not
great
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
ipa
somewhat
of
a
pleasant
surprise
not
quite
pitch
black
until
it
fills
the
glass
large
tan
head
forms
and
has
good
retention
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
plenty
of
citrus
hop
aroma
smells
like
a
straight
up
ipa
not
getting
much
from
the
darker
malt
and
the
taste
is
the
same
way
more
of
a
nondescript
pale
ale
rather
than
an
exciting
dark
beer
nice
flavor
for
what
it
is
but
i
wanted
something
more
plenty
of
citrus
flavor
and
a
little
caramel
malt
bitterness
is
moderate
the
body
is
also
nice
but
not
as
big
as
i
would
like
it
to
be
good
carbonation
and
smooth
feel
has
good
qualities
but
rather
boring
especially
for
a
proclaimed
black
ipa
it
reminds
me
of
mendicinos
black
eye
stout
a
brew
i
was
particularly
fond
of
a
definite
winner
id
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
enjoys
dark
ales
porters
and
hops
pretty
medium
bodied
and
not
harsh
on
your
palate
its
a
good
beer
but
nothing
to
rave
home
about
drinkability
is
solid
this
really
reminds
me
of
another
ipa
ive
had
in
the
past
but
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
a
good
well
rounded
ipa
with
a
bit
of
added
character
from
the
dark
malts
im
not
completely
sold
but
id
definitely
consider
picking
up
another
sixer
of
this
one
something
i
dont
usually
say
with
it
comes
to
widmer
d
big
flavoring
hops
and
big
tasty
malts
seems
to
balance
it
works
the
mouthfeel
is
not
heavy
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
id
say
this
beer
would
be
a
nice
session
brew
if
you
are
a
fan
of
ipas
but
dont
want
to
be
blasted
with
a
hop
flamethrower
a
tasty
beer
overall
impression
watery
and
flavorless
ended
up
dumping
it
down
the
drain
and
poured
a
shorts
humalupalicious
instead
poured
a
deep
black
with
good
carbonation
and
a
nice
tannish
nose
is
citrus
black
malt
taste
is
citrus
black
malt
roasted
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
citrus
floral
and
booze
feel
just
right
on
hop
bitterness
very
drinkable
and
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
i
have
had
4
26
10
327pm
jdh
i
drank
some
more
tonight
just
to
validate
yesterdays
research
and
im
sticking
to
my
guns
on
my
findings
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
this
a
good
beer
never
really
heard
of
a
black
ipa
but
it
works
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
pours
dark
brown
with
a
hint
of
reddish
color
enormous
head
that
is
quite
nice
and
the
head
is
quite
creamy
in
texture
also
nose
is
full
of
citrus
on
the
palate
theres
a
big
chocolately
malty
flavor
going
on
initially
and
then
the
bitter
hops
rush
in
to
steal
the
show
finish
has
a
nice
interplay
of
the
malt
and
bitter
hop
flavors
nice
to
more
examples
of
this
cascadian
style
as
i
was
intrigued
by
phillips
skookum
ale
that
used
to
be
called
ida
this
beer
pours
almost
black
with
a
big
white
head
the
nose
is
hoppy
at
first
but
soon
the
malts
come
out
to
play
the
taste
is
an
ipa
pnw
style
backed
up
with
lots
of
dark
malt
very
food
friendly
and
a
nice
change
from
the
big
hop
grapefruit
parade
of
ipas
from
around
here
could
have
been
more
complex
but
still
a
cool
seasonal
from
widmer
tastes
balanced
as
well
the
hops
come
through
more
than
the
malts
but
it
is
seriously
a
well
balanced
beer
pours
a
matte
black
color
with
a
reddish
tint
nice
tan
head
becomes
a
thick
film
very
mild
aroma
of
roasted
malts
nice
roasted
malt
flavor
with
good
hop
spicyness
some
bitterness
at
the
finish
and
into
the
aftertaste
fairly
constant
carbonation
a
bit
on
the
strong
side
mediumbodied
and
smooth
the
flavor
is
simple
but
tasty
something
like
a
porter
meets
ipa
good
session
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
nice
piney
citrus
smell
a
hint
of
malt
but
faint
excellent
lacing
looks
wonderful
in
the
glass
has
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it
a
slightly
dry
maltiness
a
calm
smooth
feel
in
the
mouth
the
hoppiness
lingers
well
after
drinking
feels
warm
on
the
way
down
more
than
i
expected
for
6
5
i
have
to
say
its
a
really
nice
change
from
a
normal
ipa
i
actually
like
it
a
lot

a
6er
here
in
mn
a
nice
bargin
on
a
budget
overall
a
good
but
not
great
aipa
only
had
a
few
black
ipas
now
and
this
one
is
in
the
bottom
tier
of
those
interesting
to
try
one
but
wont
be
making
the
rotation
maybe
ontap
if
best
option
over
bmc
nbootr
this
is
a
standard
iba
with
a
light
and
thankfully
subdued
roasted
character
drinkable
and
visually
appealing
d
very
drinkable
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
people
who
still
want
hops
but
different
than
an
ipa
while
more
mild
than
other
cascadian
dark
ales
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
good
not
an
imperial
ala
sublimely
self
righteous
in
terms
of
hops
or
alcohol
but
very
pleasant
probably
the
best
widmer
beer
i
have
had
actually
lighter
to
medium
in
body
with
a
nice
full
carbonation
keeping
things
lively
surprisingly
tasty
i
could
settle
down
into
a
six
pack
of
these
for
a
fair
price
happy
to
see
widmer
experimenting
with
positive
results
this
was
like
a
good
not
great
ipa
if
drinking
this
blindfolded
id
probably
not
have
guessed
it
was
a
black
ipa
do
i
care
not
really
id
definitely
drink
this
again
at
this
price
an
interesting
beer
pours
very
dark
brownblack
with
an
offwhite
head
head
could
have
lasted
a
bit
longer
creamy
mouthfeel
almost
as
if
it
came
from
a
nitrogen
tap
mild
hop
aroma
with
nice
citrus
notes
taste
is
good
with
decent
hop
bitternessqnd
a
slight
metallic
tang
a
very
drinkable
beer
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
to
try
pleasantly
surprised
very
drinkable
lots
of
pine
aroma
not
much
roasted
flavor
to
it
for
a
black
ipa
but
still
quite
tasty
drinkability
its
a
fairly
smooth
and
easy
beer
not
too
complex
semi
refreshing
after
tasting
this
beer
i
instantly
remember
drinking
it
earlier
this
year
a
very
distinctive
taste
that
one
just
cant
get
out
of
his
head
the
malt
hits
your
eyes
first
after
the
pour
i
was
excited
that
i
might
be
drinking
something
similar
to
1554
but
upon
first
taste
you
know
that
within
the
dark
liquid
an
ipa
definitely
lies
the
hops
are
in
certain
balance
with
the
malt
which
one
can
only
dream
tastes
delightful
however
it
was
more
confusing
to
my
palate
than
anything
the
finish
was
both
clean
and
dirty
i
had
this
beer
last
night
and
can
still
not
put
my
finger
on
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
dark
brown
opaque
body
one
finger
offwhite
head
medium
dissipation
with
some
lacing
present
the
nose
is
roasted
malts
a
bit
of
chocolate
with
grassy
hops
taste
replicates
the
nose
but
i
picked
up
more
roasted
malts
and
esp
chocolate
than
i
did
in
the
bottled
version
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
on
the
backend
but
fairly
well
balanced
mouthfeel
was
full
and
surprising
dry
finish
not
a
great
session
beer
a
bit
heavy
to
do
3
or
4
i
prefer
this
to
the
bottled
version
fwtw
d
this
is
an
ok
ipa
ive
had
some
really
tasty
black
ipas
recently
and
this
one
stacks
up
as
just
above
average
i
was
hoping
that
you
would
be
able
to
taste
the
roasted
malts
more
others
that
ive
had
only
have
the
cascade
hop
show
up
in
the
finish
so
that
you
get
a
nice
coffee
malt
flavor
before
the
hop
kicks
in
d
this
is
an
interesting
twist
on
the
ipa
i
like
the
extra
complexity
but
the
acidity
was
a
little
too
prevalent
a
nice
beer
overall
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
have
another
a
great
beer
to
have
on
a
budget
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
it
on
tap
however
to
see
if
any
other
flavors
would
come
out
definitely
give
it
a
try
d
average
offering
run
of
the
mill
aipa
whatevz
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
some
slickness
on
the
palate
but
still
nice
and
clean
balance
seems
good
though
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
of
an
appearane
from
the
roasted
malts
you
get
a
little
hint
of
them
in
the
aroma
and
with
the
dry
grainy
finish
but
i
wouldnt
call
them
a
significant
player
in
this
beer
the
subtlety
is
probably
a
good
thing
though
because
if
they
were
a
lot
stronger
it
would
be
two
strong
flavors
battling
for
attention
good
beer
certainly
could
be
a
session
candidate
i
recommend
the
w
10
cheers
quite
nice
easy
drinking
and
well
balanced
id
get
this
one
again
d
a
solid
brew
not
something
i
think
ill
revisit
though
a
good
place
to
try
this
new
style
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
and
no
dominating
flavors
not
a
hop
crazy
ipa
interesting
beer
worth
seeking
out
pitch
black
ipa
is
not
pitch
black
thats
really
disappointing
when
held
up
to
my
450
watt
light
source
i
can
see
bloody
red
streaking
nice
aroma
though
mix
of
dark
malts
and
resiny
hops
upon
tasting
i
realize
at
once
this
is
no
alpha
klaus
but
then
again
not
many
reach
that
standard
of
black
ipa
this
is
actually
quite
good
tough
nice
roasted
chocolatey
tones
ipa
traits
are
actully
fairly
muted
but
citrusy
in
nature
medium
bodied
and
really
quite
flavorful
and
drinkable
give
me
some
roast
suckling
pig
and
a
pint
or
two
of
this
and
im
good
to
go
d
eh
not
a
big
fan
of
this
i
dont
get
the
black
ipa
thing
roast
flavors
dont
make
much
sense
here
notes
by
far
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
widmer
to
date
its
the
only
black
ipa
ive
had
so
its
unique
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
somewhat
like
arrogant
bastard
but
with
a
more
porterlike
malt
profile
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
for
a
hardcore
hophead
its
more
for
someone
who
likes
balance
but
wants
to
get
into
hoppier
beers
this
beer
definitely
keeps
you
guessing
and
is
a
very
good
value
in
the
end
i
would
have
preferred
a
more
hoppy
concentration
in
a
black
ipa
but
i
can
understand
why
this
would
have
won
a
gold
medal
d
very
drinkable
ipa
nothing
spectacular
but
good
nonetheless
the
roasted
malts
add
a
nice
demension
of
flavor
to
an
otherwise
ordinary
ipa
the
alcohol
is
hidden
and
the
abv
isnt
so
high
that
you
can
only
have
one
in
a
night
ive
been
really
diggin
this
beer
black
pale
ale
hilarious
pretty
much
what
i
would
expect
very
hoppy
in
the
nose
with
some
roast
malt
character
hops
carry
on
in
the
finish
and
mingle
well
with
the
slightly
sweet
and
reastrained
roast
malt
profile
i
really
like
it
easy
to
drink
and
covers
lots
of
bases
d
initially
i
think
of
this
as
a
utility
micro
good
for
many
meal
choices
or
a
party
with
hours
d
ovres
of
many
styles
hoppy
and
malty
doesnt
match
it
with
any
particular
food
but
makes
it
a
choice
for
any
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
from
the
brothers
i
find
most
widmer
brews
to
be
understated
to
the
point
of
being
almost
dull
but
this
beer
is
certainly
worth
your
time
very
interesting
beer
cant
remember
having
a
beer
this
hoppy
but
still
with
a
roasted
malt
flavor
drinkability
very
sessionable
and
in
general
just
a
refreshing
new
twist
on
a
classic
style
reccommended
i
would
imagine
this
would
be
tough
to
nail
as
it
needs
the
juicy
hoppiness
of
a
west
coast
ipa
without
a
whole
lot
of
specialty
malt
influence
it
does
just
that
as
this
is
a
hopforward
beer
with
a
thin
enough
body
to
not
jump
into
the
realm
of
hoppy
porter
or
stout
there
is
some
roasty
toasty
malt
presence
and
amazingly
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
the
lupulin
there
is
also
a
nice
mix
of
flavoring
and
bittering
hops
that
are
an
influence
from
start
to
finish
not
the
best
ipa
out
there
for
sure
but
it
is
fun
to
drink
and
tastes
nice
and
fresh
i
will
definitely
buy
at
least
one
more
sixer
of
this
good
job
widmer
brothers
overall
this
was
certainly
worth
a
try
although
probably
not
one
id
return
to
on
a
regular
basis
the
beer
pours
black
with
a
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
piney
hops
with
some
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
mainly
piney
hops
but
there
is
some
citrus
hops
in
there
as
well
there
is
also
a
roasted
malt
backbone
which
is
very
interesting
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
combination
of
tasty
hop
flavors
and
a
subtle
easydrinking
mouthfeel
make
black
pitch
terribly
drinkable
highly
recommended
d
a
decent
black
ipa
the
flavor
is
on
the
lighter
side
but
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
a
night
you
buy
now
d
drinkability
is
good
due
to
the
crisp
body
but
i
dont
need
more
than
one
i
wish
i
saw
more
schwarzipas
this
is
a
fun
hybrid
one
of
the
best
widmer
brothers
brews
ive
had
verdict
this
is
essentially
a
solid
highly
drinkable
american
ipa
with
just
a
little
more
malt
intensity
imminently
satisfying
theres
something
about
this
beer
that
i
just
love
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
from
widmer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
all
of
the
new
black
dipas
and
still
found
this
beer
quite
enjoyable
theres
a
healthy
if
restrained
roastedchocolate
malt
note
the
hops
are
floral
and
piney
strong
but
not
harsh
its
quite
dry
which
is
very
good
for
this
substyle
its
a
creamy
rich
beer
that
drinks
bigger
than
its
abv
i
assume
this
beer
is
a
limited
edition
which
is
really
a
shame
as
its
quite
good
nice
smell
to
it
with
citrus
dominating
initially
i
wasnt
sold
on
this
but
as
it
warmed
over
the
1520
minutes
that
i
drank
it
it
really
grew
on
me
it
moved
from
starting
out
as
a
highly
hopped
porter
to
a
darkened
ipa
good
bitterness
but
not
overpowering
overall
i
would
buy
a
sixer
of
it
again
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
great
though
basically
a
hoppy
porter
thats
not
sweet
did
i
mention
im
still
not
totally
sold
on
the
whole
cda
thing
other
comments
love
this
beer
should
be
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
the
burgeoning
cascadian
dark
ale
style
dthis
beer
goes
down
quite
well
and
if
sipped
on
one
could
session
this
easily
i
think
ill
get
some
more
actually
i
got
this
in
a
make
your
own
6er
and
i
want
more
i
would
suggest
this
to
any
hop
lover
like
me

the
hoppy
bitterness
floral
mostly
a
bit
of
citrus
but
not
much
then
the
malt
kicks
in
with
authority
lots
of
roasty
toasty
goodness
none
of
the
flavors
ever
become
overwhelming
they
balance
out
relatively
well
the
main
detraction
from
this
one
is
it
is
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
one
would
expect
a
bit
of
a
fuller
beer
but
its
quite
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
i
liked
how
creamy
the
beer
was
for
an
ipa
it
was
just
weird
to
see
the
malts
and
the
hops
battle
it
out
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
pretty
drinkable
as
well
it
took
me
a
few
bottles
into
my
sixer
to
come
to
appreciate
this
beer
but
im
liking
it
more
and
more
it
has
more
hops
than
many
ipas
out
there
and
mixes
it
up
with
some
of
the
dark
flavors
without
overdoing
it
great
job
with
a
hard
brew
to
pull
off
widmer
enjoy
this
one
fresh
to
get
the
full
effect
of
its
excellent
hops
body
is
full
and
a
tocuh
creamy
especially
on
the
swallow
overall
a
great
example
of
the
cascadian
dark
ale
style
now
if
theyd
only
put
that
description
on
the
bottle
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
it
was
a
nice
party
favor
but
not
something
id
choose
over
sn
or
any
other
fine
session
ipas
i
can
get
really
dark
brownmore
than
black
but
that
was
the
least
of
my
complaints
it
smelled
weird
sort
of
hoppy
and
then
brown
ale
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
mostly
dark
malts
with
a
slight
bit
of
hops
like
a
hoppy
brown
ale
but
not
an
ipa
as
far
as
my
tastebuds
are
concerned
still
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
true
black
ipa
like
stone

12
oz
single
carrying
on
my
tradition
of
having
all
the
w
series
beers
appearance
black
beer
luscious
tan
head
smart
and
handsome
aroma
is
mainlly
of
hops
though
the
malt
breadiness
is
there
in
the
back
taste
well
this
is
somthing
quite
unique
actually
quite
stong
hopping
as
expected
from
a
pnw
ipa
then
the
hop
biterness
is
somehow
accented
by
bitter
sweet
roasted
maltiness
with
a
slight
hint
of
bread
very
nice
on
the
palte
thick
and
intrest
holding
very
bitter
aftertaste
lingers
for
some
time
overall
an
excellent
beer
from
the
brothers
i
think
they
need
to
make
this
a
regular
winter
seasonal
enjoyed
the
beer
alot
would
have
another
but
not
a
session
beer
this
beer
is
fantastic
well
rounded
with
astoundingly
awesome
balance
i
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
beer
loved
it
d
goes
down
easily
wont
kill
your
tastebuds
or
fill
you
up
immediately
either
a
pretty
solid
release
by
kurt
and
rob
and
an
excellent
gateway
into
an
interesting
style
all
in
all
a
drinkable
beer
i
dont
think
the
darkness
adds
much
to
it
in
fact
i
think
it
is
reminiscent
of
the
broken
halo
ipa
id
have
expected
a
black
ipa
to
be
a
bigger
beer
and
less
drinkable
dthis
very
drinkable
at

abv
it
is
at
the
lighter
end
for
an
ipa
well
done
the
widmer
pitch
black
ipa
pours
like
a

with
a
thick

good

good

hoppy

slight

that
follow
through
as
flavors
on
the
palates
along
with
a
definite
hop
bitterness
good
balance
creamy
texture
long
finish
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
one
that
id
highly
recommend
overall
very
good
surprisingly
very
good
its
not
wildly
complex
in
terms
of
hops
or
malt
but
they
picked
the
right
flavors
to
showcase
good
malt
flavor
that
still
lets
the
hop
flavor
shine
through
very
solid
flavor
profile
on
this
black
ipa
with
a
touch
of
black
patent
malts
adding
some
roast
and
dark
chocolate
notes
the
hops
steamroll
in
for
the
finish
to
add
a
piny
bitterness
that
smacks
with
resin
and
grapefruit
peel
slight
warmth
from
the
alcohol
too
great
mouthfeel
with
a
medium
body
and
a
welldesigned
low
carbonation
level
that
adds
just
enough
bubbliness
to
liven
up
the
back
of
the
palate
w10
is
one
of
the
better
releases
from
widmer
as
of
late
and
i
very
much
look
forward
to
the
rest
of
my
sixpack
overall
an
easy
drinking
ipa
that
helps
define
this
seemingly
new
style
of
ipa
the
body
is
what
i
find
most
lacking
with
this
brew
id
like
to
see
more
richness
here
its
worthy
to
a
hop
lover
but
dont
expect
to
be
bowled
over
by
this
one
that
being
said
the
more
i
drink
this
beer
the
more
i
like
it
its
very
well
rounded
and
while
the
mouthfeel
isnt
the
biggest
its
an
ipa
that
doesnt
disappoint
on
the
hops
if
i
didnt
hate
the
word
drinkability
so
much
id
say
this
w10
rates
high
on
that
list
overall
this
beer
is
the
best
i
have
ever
had
from
widmer
and
wish
this
was
year
around
this
is
certainly
my
go
to
beer
for
as
long
as
it
can
be
there
is
a
mild
very
smooth
drinkability
to
this
ipa
the
finish
is
crisp
and
the
hops
leave
a
nice
dry
twang
very
drinkable
and
really
enjoyed
this
one
another
great
season
for
widmer
taste
is
creamy
pine
a
touch
of
coffee
grapefruit
some
caramel
malt
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
ends
a
little
dry
and
nicely
bitter
overall
a
decent
brew
i
dont
know
if
i
like
the
competing
roastcitrus
notes
but
nevertheless
a
solid
offering
by
widmer
an
enjoyable
pint
worth
repeating
ive
just
found
a
six
pack
at
the
store
and
will
be
trying
the

it

try

i
wouldnt

overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
nose
and
flavoring
these
were
both
surprisingly
robust
zesty
hoppy
and
wellbalanced
helping
to
keep
things
fresh
and
drinkable
the
nose
especially
held
a
bright
zestiness
that
really
reminded
us
of
lagunitas
sucks
in
the
sense
that
it
was
fruity
hoppy
and
cleanly
blended
the
grain
bill
is
obviously
much
darker
but
this
only
contributed
to
the
intrigue
and
depth
of
the
taste
the
feel
was
creamy
and
smooth
with
soft
finish
this
brew
exhibits
the
premiere
blending
of
styles
into
the
american
black
ale
and
is
our
favorite
to
date
from
the
brewery
and
perhaps
even
a
rival
to
the
illustrious
sublimely
selfrighteous
overall
a
tasty
and
drinkable
brew
overall
although
it
was
not
really
all
that
hoppy
tasting
as
a
iba
would
be
expected
to
be
it
drinks
nice
and
is
rather
enjoyable
but
dont
expect
a
hop
powerhouse
here
overall
this
beer
is
very
unique
a
dark
and
sweet
and
smooth
ipa
pretty
cool
worth
a
try
if
you
want
a
unique
taste
that
is
well
balanced
and
not
too
strong
at
7
25
the
taste
has
many
of
the
dark
lager
characteristics
i
expect
including
dark
malts
and
moderate
bitterness
actually
fairly
easy
to
drink
o
a
good
beer
but
i
think
the
avery
new
world
porter
is
more
tasty
for
this
style
to
the
point
a
nice
black
ipa
worthy
to
try
overall
pretty
solid
aba
here
i
have
enjoyed
this
before
and
look
forward
to
more
in
the
future
overall
its
a
good
addition
to
the
heavy
seas
lineup
a
nice
add
on
to
the
loose
cannon
more
complex
but
it
retains
the
drinkability
overall
a
solid
but
different
black
ipa
the
chewing
tobacco
flavor
is
unique
i
like
this
one
and
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
black
ipa
this
is
an
affordable
option
o
a
big
black
ale
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
bottle
of
simple
as
that
this
is
not
an
overly
complex
beer
but
it
is
one
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
tastes
more
like
a
stout
than
heavy
seas
imperial
stout
peg
leg
its
very
very
burnt
so
burnt
in
fact
that
the
hoppiness
is
overshadowed
this
is
not
a
terrible
thing
but
i
think
this
could
use
some
balance
in
its
present
state
this
is
good
but
not
fantastic
not
as
strong
an
offering
as
the
loose
cannon
but
still
an
interesting
brew
particularly
for
the
nose
overall
doesnt
leave
much
an
impression
for
me
was
hoping
for
a
maltier
beer
o
one
of
my
favorite
local
beers
it
deserves
higher
praise
o
drinkable
and
something
that
falls
short
of
the
loose
cannon
in
almost
every
category
lacking
the
complexity
and
boldness
i
enjoy
in
this
style
o
meh
not
one
id
buy
again
i
guess
my
standards
are
just
too
high
for
black
ipas
o
this
works
much
better
if
you
go
into
this
expecting
a
wellhopped
stout
instead
of
a
proper
black
ale
when
looked
at
as
the
former
its
really
damn
good
id
buy
it
again
thats
for
sure
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
deep
brown
color
with
a
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
lacing
is
decent
as
well
as
the
retention
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
hoppy
and
also
gives
off
some
molasseslike
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
kind
of
bland
there
isnt
a
big
hop
punch
and
i
think
the
dark
malts
mute
the
ipa
essence
that
this
should
have
the
mouthfeel
is
good
its
lighter
than
expected
not
much
depth
here
overall
this
beer
is
average
for
the
style
i
feel
cheers
this
is
a
nice
offering
it
pours
up
an
opaque
black
nice
medium
tan
head
good
retention
and
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
hops
roasted
malt
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
strong
taste
is
maybe
some
fruit
and
malt
on
the
front
giving
way
to
a
assertive
powerful
and
pleasing
bitterness
with
a
coffee
dark
chocolate
hops
flavor
at
the
finish
better
enjoyed
slowly
than
guzzled
this
is
a
nice
offering
which
i
would
drink
again
overall
a
great
beer
one
i
like
to
savor
slowly
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
this
isnt
quite
in
line
with
what
i
like
in
cdas
but
it
has
some
good
qualities
in
terms
of
roastiness
id
like
more
potent
hops
overall
its
not
bad
but
im
not
going
to
go
looking
for
it
this
is
a
decent
black
ipa
a
bit
too
tangy
at
times
but
it
pulls
some
nice
hoppy
tones
on
the
body
id
expect
for
the
style
consistent
flavor
delivery
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
probably
one
of
the
better
from
this
brewery
straight
off
of
memory
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
nothing
outstanding
but
an
overall
solid
beer
black
in
color
with
brownish
hues
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
poured
with
a
thin
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
soapy
cap
leaving
sheets
of
wet
lacings
on
the
glass
citrus
hop
and
roasted
malt
aromas
upfront
with
a
hint
of
pine
hops
in
the
back
on
the
thicker
side
of
medium
bodied
with
a
rich
smooth
feel
dark
roasted
malt
flavors
up
front
competing
with
pine
hop
bitterness
dark
flavors
intensify
thru
the
middle
introducing
a
more
burnt
malt
characteristic
hop
flavors
allow
a
flash
of
citrus
hop
characteristic
toward
the
end
finishes
with
roasted
malt
and
coffee
flavors
with
pine
and
citrus
hop
bitterness
beneath
i
would
characterize
this
as
a
malt
forward
black
ipa
mouthfeel
the
is
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
just
like
a
ipa
but
it
is
hard
on
the
eyes
seeing
a
black
beer
and
your
palate
is
expecting
a
thick
and
oily
feel
to
it
and
it
is
blasted
with
a
medium
bodied
beer
that
flows
quite
nicely
in
and
around
the
mouth
this
is
a
great
representation
of
this
style
of
beer
even
though
this
tends
to
be
the
new
and
up
coming
style
so
many
lack
the
flavor
of
the
dark
malts
but
this
is
one
that
is
better
than
most
probably
one
of
the
best
representations
of
the
style
i
have
drank
drinkability
an
excellent
brew
dry
hopping
would
put
this
over
the
top
probably
my
favorite
hybrid
style
good
tasty
beer
for
anytime
o
not
terrible
but
not
a
dark
ipa
that
should
be
a
goto
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
but
it
just
doesnt
follow
through
does
not
have
an
average
ipa
taste
more
of
a
porter
to
me
goes
down
smooth
with
not
a
huge
after
taste
but
definitely
coats
the
tongue
it
is
a
good
beer
but
just
not
what
i
expected
i
would
drink
two
of
these
in
one
sitting
and
would
buy
it
again
a
must
try
for
a
beer
fan
overall
with
the
complexity
of
the
flavor
and
remarkable
texture
this
is
a
beer
i
will
definitely
have
again
if
given
the
opportunity
o
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
but
in
a
flight
with
some
other
cannons
it
would
make
a
cool
tasting
i
still
cant
understand
how
these
heavy
seas
beers
get
ratings
above
3
this
one
was
awful
pours
black
with
small
slightly
off
white
head
smells
of
stale
burnt
grain
dirt
muddled
mess
of
roasted
grains
and
sweetness
no
hop
presence
that
i
can
tell
the
flavor
follows
with
some
roasted
grain
that
is
both
watery
and
overly
sweet
at
the
same
time
there
is
no
trace
of
hop
bite
or
balance
here
and
this
really
comes
off
as
just
a
heavy
muddled
mess
lowish
carbonation
have
yet
to
find
anything
worth
drinking
from
these
guys
d
this
was
a
nice
black
ipa
but
didnt
have
the
most
unique
or
delicious
scent
and
taste
the
body
was
mediocre
and
the
finish
was
a
bit
harsh
so
it
wasnt
the
easiest
to
drink
enjoyable
brew
but
clearly
lacked
refinement
and
great
appeal
interesting
worth
trying
overall
this
one
of
the
better
black
ales
ive
had
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
black
ipa
as
styled
on
the
label
nor
does
it
stray
into
the
charred
stout
territory
whatever
it
is
its
tops
for
drinkability
12
oz
bottle
from
food
and
friends
in
philadelphia
the
feel
is
nice
a
medium
body
with
plenty
of
crispness
to
it
remains
semidry
all
the
way
highly
approachable
especially
if
new
to
black
ipas
overall
this
is
a
pretty
nice
beer
more
american
stout
than
black
ipa
ill
drink
more
of
this
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
moderate
carbonation
not
the
best
balance
of
malts
and
hops
definitely
leans
towards
the
malty
side
of
things
but
not
a
bad
one
to
try
its
something
a
little
different
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
fuller
side
of
medium
bodied
great
carbonation
with
an
awesome
malt
character
that
holds
everything
together
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
great
complexity
yet
amazing
drinkability
jesus
christ
this
beer
is
good
subtle
notes
of
candy
and
licorice
simply
put
this
beer
has
amazingly
blended
flavors
quite
a
surprise
in
a
world
of
mediocre
black
ales
this
thing
really
shines
i
love
it
overall
a
fairly
even
balance
of
malt
and
hop
perhaps
leaning
more
to
the
malty
side
good
beer
but
not
a
standout
pours
black
with
moderate
cap
of
khaki
froth
nice
streaky
lacing
scent
was
nearly
non
existent
with
hints
of
orange
blossom
lightly
citrus
and
floral
light
roast
taste
brings
a
little
more
hop
character
orange
flowers
and
grass
dark
malts
faintly
roasted
and
toasted
dry
on
the
palate
faintly
chalky
in
a
style
with
many
interpretations
this
one
is
meek
and
mild

overall
a
nice
enjoyable
balanced
beer
a
very
good
black
ale
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
with
wonderful
smoked
flavoring
while
the
smoked
malts
seem
to
be
covering
up
the
hops
bitter
bite
but
it
still
ends
with
a
nice
ipa
bite
id
call
it
more
of
a
smoked
ale
than
an
ipa
but
is
fantastic
in
its
uniqueness
and
full
flavored
taste
great
beer
o
i
think
this
is
your
average
black
ipa
in
the
past
these
beers
have
stood
out
because
of
the
hoppy
finish
but
not
really
getting
that
here
the
only
thing
that
pushes
this
beer
above
average
is
i
think
the
alcohol
is
very
well
managed
the
7
5
indicates
there
should
be
some
booziness
but
theres
none
so
bravo
there
o
an
great
black
ipa
been
wanting
it
for
a
while
just
now
found
it
its
not
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
but
its
a
good
one
and
well
represents
what
a
black
ipa
is
pretty
average
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
level
and
body
are
each
fine
overall
this
is
a
weak
attempt
a
failure
even
compare
this
to
say
stone
sublimely
selfrighteous
ale
and
the
difference
will
be
stark
heavy
seas
black
cannon
is
a
beer
whose
flavor
components
just
dont
work
together
appearance
dark
and
mysterious
lacing
is
nice
smell
is
hoppy
lager
full
bodied
nice
hop
with
a
dry
finish
in
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
swallows
nice
overall
this
is
a
good
dark
ipa
one
worth
of
the
fridge
great
with
swiss
cheese
overall
this
brew
underwhelms
it
does
not
appear
that
the
mix
of
malt
chocolate
and
hops
is
quite
right
overall
very
solid
brew
clean
flavorstastes
with
a
nice
bitterness
coming
through
would
really
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
enjoyable
flavorful
and
nicely
crafted
but
a
bit
on
the
underwhelming
side
d
this
beer
goes
down
dangerously
well
for
its
7
25
abv
the
balance
is
a
bit
more
towards
the
malty
side
than
one
might
expect
from
an
ipa
but
it
definitely
works
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
from
a
great
brewery
o
a
decent
bipa
good
dark
chocolatecoffee
balance
with
a
citrus
hop
feel
best
black
ipa
ive
had
pretty
well
balanced
although
it
leans
towards
the
ipa
hops
something
i
would
certainly
get
again
tangerine
hops
are
the
most
stand
out
part
of
this
brew
pours
black
with
a
14
inch
brown
head
and
lacing
to
the
end
its
aroma
is
a
curious
mix
of
grapefruit
and
coffee
the
flavor
leads
with
a
quick
grapefruit
tang
followed
through
by
coffee
and
a
note
of
anise
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
and
full
clipper
city
heavy
seas
black
cannon
is
and
interesting
beer
slightly
recommended
o
just
like
with
dubbel
cannon
and
belgian
yeast
they
took
loose
cannon
and
instead
introduced
a
high
malt
bill
im
down
i
especially
dig
the
aroma
this
dark
dark
beer
has
a
hoppy
scent
and
a
generous
finger
of
cafe
au
lait
head
thats
fairly
persistent
had
to
look
a
bit
for
the
smell
of
the
roasted
malts
but
its
in
there
too
taste
has
espresso
and
chocolate
from
the
roasted
malts
with
some
balancing
bitter
the
mouth
feel
isnt
as
heavy
as
i
was
expecting
which
i
actually
like
overall
a
very
nice
drinkable
beer
didnt
think
i
would
like
the
style
but
i
do
a
nice
treat
and
a
fair
representation
of
the
bipa
family
definitely
enjoyable
and
worth
a
try
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
the
flavor
is
good
but
so
odd
on
the
palate
that
its
hard
to
have
more
than
one
it
was
worth
trying
once
black
opaque
body
one
finger
offwhite
head
small
bubbles
nose
is
more
roast
than
citrus
taste
is
opposite
the
nose
citrus
over
roast
no

mouthfeel
is
light
for
style
medium
dry
finish
ok
but
not
that
great
i
guess
having
drank
barley
browns
turmoil
you
can
call
me
jaded
pours
a
solid
dark
brown
with
the
faintest
of
garnet
highlights
when
held
to
light
smallish
off
white
head
rises
and
falls
quickly
leaving
a
moderate
amount
of
lace
smells
of
grapefruit
and
pine
with
hints
of
bread
and
caramel
taste
follows
the
aroma
fairly
well
but
adds
a
small
bit
of
chocolate
and
roasted
grain
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
decent
beer
quite
drinkable
if
not
a
little
simple
still
its
a
good
beer
overall
not
doing
it
for
me
for
this
style
malt
angle
and
sweetness
doesnt
jive
and
the
hop
angle
is
totaly
non
existent
poured
a
12
oz

snifter
pours
pitch

with
a
nice
frothy
head
really
nice
body
and
tons
of
malt
up

is
amazing
with
hoppy
notes
that
linger
nicely
truly
a
quality
beer
wellbalanced
and
highly
recomended
cheers
to
the
brewery
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
that
exemplifies
the
style
welldecent
malt
flavors
and
decent
hops
this
is
a
great
beer
to
keep
on
hand
tasty
interesting
and
refreshing
cheers
overall
impression
seems
like
a
hopped
up
robust
american
porter
i
dont
know
that
i
taste
a
lot
of
loose
cannon
in
here
as
the
brewer
suggests
however
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
takes
the
best
of
a
robust
porter
and
an
american
ipa
and
blends
for
an
enjoyable
finished
product
will
have
again
o
not
quite
ill
keep
trying
and
revise
my
review
as
necessary
a
case
worthy
brew
here
perfect
balance
of
roasted
dark
malts
and
lots
of
sticky
oily
hops
awesome
stuff
here
o
i
like
a
wee
bit
more
chocolate
malt
in
my
american
black
ales
but
the
roasted
barley
and
charcoal
provides
a
nice
enough
contrast
to
the
hops
that
its
a
fairly
minor
quibble
good
stuff
and
highly
drinkable
a
robust
look
and
easy
drinking
body
were
about
the
highlights
here
for
me
as
this
came
off
as
overly
leafy
and
spicy
feeling
and
just
not
as
overall
flavorful
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
there
is
enough
potential
here
to
maybe
try
a
bottle
yourself
though
and
make
up
your
own
mind
o
having
enjoyed
loose
cannon
in
the
past
i
was
excited
to
see
this
beer
and
give
it
a
try
this
beer
might
be
based
on
the
loose
cannon
recipe
but
it
tastes
like
a
totally
different
beer
to
me
i
thought
it
was
fairly
tasty
with
its
coffee
earthy
and
smoky
flavors
but
i
was
hoping
for
a
bigger
showing
of
hops
in
the
taste
like
i
detected
in
the
nose
that
said
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
and
wouldnt
mind
having
some
more
d
pretty
good
stuff
i
love
black
ipas
to
begin
with
so
i
could
drink
it
all
day
not
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
but
would
definately
buy
again
overall
im
glad
i
tried
it
and
it
makes
a
solid
opening
drink
before
a
nice
steak
at
flemings
i
probably
wont
revisit
it
for
a
while
though
o
a
very
balanced
ale
not
quite
enough
hops
to
be
considered
an
ipa
i
think
i
prefer
the
standered
loose
cannon
but
all
in
all
another
solid
brew
from
clipper
city
o
one
of
my
favorite
black
ipas
note
this
was
the
first
time
i
tried
it
and
i
want
more
i
had
it
right
after
a
work
out
at
the
gym
and
it
put
my
in
a
happy
place
pours
dark
brown
almost
black
in
color
off
white
head
aroma
of
citrusy
hops
roasted
malt
smoke
and
a
mild
fruityness
in
the
taste
roasted
malts
with
coffee
chocolate
and
faint
anise
lots
of
bright
hop
flavor
grapefruit
pine
and
rind
bitterness
from
the
roasted
malt
and
hop
is
pretty
well
balanced
with
some
sugary
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
black
ipa
or
american
black
ale
or
cascadian
dark
ale
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
pours
a
deep
rich
opaque
sable
with
a
fairly
substantial
tan
head
that
leaves
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
strong
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
and
evergreen
with
an
undertone
of
sour
citrus
mainly
grapefruit
with
a
touch
of
tangerine
hoppy
smoky
flavor
has
grapefruit
tangerine
and
roast
coffee
notes
like
a
good
ipa
yet
clearly
the
black
variety
i
love
this
style
smooth
firm
texture
has
a
good
fizz
and
leaves
a
smoky
hoppy
tingle
pours
black
with
brown
highlights
and
a
mocha
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
a
nice
hop
bouquet
malt
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
hop
up
front
subtly
sweet
with
a
hoppy
and
malt
finish
with
some
roasted
characteristics
a
medium
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
a
nice
depth
of
flavor
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
good
flavors
worth
checking
out
overall
because
i
couldnt
tell
this
beer
apart
from
loose
cannon
im
knocking
it
down
a
little
i
dont
really
understand
making
the
same
beer
but
different
appearance
anyway
love
to
drink
it
o
i
really
loved
the
beer
but
dont
think
it
was
much
of
a
black
ipa
there
really
arent
many
hops
and
the
toasty
smokey
flavors
remind
me
more
of
a
smoked
porter
than
a
black
ipa
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
get
again
i
would
like
to
taste
this
side
by
side
with
heavy
seas
smoke
on
the
water
which
i
had
about
a
month
ago
for
a
bit
of
perspective
had
this
on
cask
at
maxs
in
baltimore
have
only
tried
cask
beers
a
few
times
before
but
this
was
definitely
a
great
beer
nice
jet
black
color
roasted
malt
and
hoppy
aroma
medium
bodied
great
mouthfeel
great
balance
between
roasted
malts
and
hoppiness
with
the
smoothness
of
the
cask
giving
it
the
perfect
touch
awesome
beer
but
still
not
as
good
as
the
siren
noir
on
cask
which
was
like
a
liquid
hersheys
bar
totally
glad
i
got
try
this
on
cask
and
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
sixer
of
it
in
the
store
i
think
more
than
anything
the
black
cannon
has
great
drinkability
its
a
relatively
mild
example
of
a
black
ipa
and
thats
exactly
why
i
like
it
i
think
this
is
a
great
beer
to
switch
some
of
your
friends
to
craft
beer
you
know
who
i
mean
those
buddies
that
think
theyre
drinking
good
beer
when
they
come
home
with
heini
amstel
or
corona
o
not
the
best
ive
had
for
this
style
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
if
offered
besides
that
orange
peel
finish
its
not
too
bad
i
should
probably
have
a
fresh
bottle
and
revisit
the
review
similar
flavors
mild
bitterness
coffee
and
cocoa
roasted
malts
a
mellow
hoppiness
enough
balance
here
to
keep
things
interesting
some
depth
from
the
earthy
roast
malt
and
residual
hoppy
bitterness
nothing
crazy
just
well
put
together
going
to
revisit
heavy
seas
after
this
one
d
overall
a
good
example
of
the
bipa
category
it
leans
towards
the
malt
more
than
usual
but
it
works
out
alright
o
interesting
beer
worthwhile
drink
would
have
again
but
probably
prefer
the
original
loose
cannon
recipe
overall
it
was
a
decent
dark
ipa
but
nothing
to
special
overall
a
good
beer
that
tastes
like
a
ipastout
combo
from
notes
12
oz
bottle
pours
black
with
a
mediumsized
foamy
tan
head
aroma
has
lots
of
floral
hops
smokiness
and
some
caramel
malts
the
first
sip
of
this
brew
was
much
smokier
than
i
was
expecting
but
i
quickly
adjusted
to
it
and
enjoyed
it
also
had
lots
of
floral
hoppiness
and
piney
resin
with
some
vanilla
flavors
on
the
back
end
very
well
balanced
finish
is
slightly
sweet
and
hoppy
a
pretty
decent
black
ipa
the
flavors
are
nice
however
they
are
a
bit
segmented
and
dont
quite
meld
together
i
think
it
is
a
great
beer
and
would
definitely
try
again
taste
is
well
balanced
like
a
regular
loose
cannon
ipa
with
the
addition
of
the
roasted
malts
around
the
edges
a
pleasant
combination
and
a
worthy
treat
o
not
a
great
black
ipa
3
o
an
interesting
beer
and
style
this
was
my
first
black
ipa
and
i
was
impressed
could
have
been
a
little
bit
more
balanced
with
the
malts
and
hops
but
overall
a
decent
beer
near
perfect
balance
of
rich
roasted
malts
smoked
notes
dark
earthy
and
piney
hops
warming
only
brings
the
hops
to
the
front
even
more
and
allows
them
to
steal
the
show
quick
hitting
and
bitter
as
the
first
sip
hits
your
palate
it
was
amazing
how
smooth
and
easy
this
one
went
down
nice
long
finish
initially
was
wrapped
in
hoppy
dryness
and
twang
but
melted
into
molasses
and
rich
caramel
malts
that
left
a
light
sweet
flavor
deep
black
in
color
it
has
rich
notes
of
caramel
and
citrus
fruit
such
as
grapefruit
balanced
by
roasted
malt
and
hints
of
piny
hops
with
a
smoky
backbone
the
smokiness
of
black
cannon
gives
this
ale
more
of
a
rauchbier
or
porter
character
than
that
of
a
black
ipa
nevertheless
black
cannon
is
a
smooth
fullbodied
beer

i
would
call
this
more
of
a
porter
than
a
black
ipa
i
guess
that
the
lines
are
drawn
somewhere
and
can
see
this
either
way
i
guess
i
am
not
a

of
the

could

go
through

like
black

this
one
had
an
above

mouthfeel
and
some
orange
taste
in
addition
to
the
cascadian
hop
that
lends
itself
a
grapefruit
edge
a
little
chocolate
and
roast
a
good

very

this
was

a

for
me
nothing
too
badi
definitely
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
to
mebut
this
really
didnt
strike
me
as
a

ipa
as
its
supposed
to
be
i
know
the
category
is
american
black
ale
but
i
still
think
of
them
as

been
hearing
about
black
ipas
for
awhile
and
wanted
to
see
what
the
hype
was
about
and
i
found
a
pack
of
this
while
at
the
liquor
store
the
other
night
i
saw
it
described
as
loose
cannon
based
so
i
thought
since
i
liked
that
this
would
be
worth
a
go
it
is
interesting
it
pours
black
with
a
tan
head
it
smells
very
simillar
to
loose
cannon
taste
begins
the
same
as
loose
cannon
with
alot
of
hoppyness
but
then
there
is
this
interesting
taste
i
cant
quite
put
my
hand
on
in
the
finish
this
flavor
doesnt
really
help
the
drinkability
any
and
kind
of
hurts
it
a
little
bit
not
bad
but
its
not
as
good
as
loose
cannon
because
of
whatever
that
little
flavor
change
is
hdofujan
30
and
like
the
best
of
them
there
needs
to
be
more
roast
to
balance
things
out
i
dont
think
id
have
this
one
again

overall
i
was
honestly
expecting
more
hop
action
coming
from
this
brew
its
bitter
and
has
a
slightly
floralcitrusy
hop
presence
but
its
pounded
by
the
malt
this
beer
reminds
me
of
i
think
its
anger
by
greenbush
brewery
and
nighttime
by
lagunitas
its
playyyyyed
maybe
its
the
style
to
me
but
all
these
black
ipas
seem
the
same
drinkable
but
nothing
special
if
youre
looking
for
more
of
a
dark
malt
driven
showcase
with
some
slight
hop
action
this
is
a
beer
for
you
i
just
prefer
hop
explosion
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
one
pours
jet
black
and
almost
looks
like
a
stout
but
drinks
like
a
normal
ipa
one
of
the
better
shorts
beers
i
have
had
these
guys
are
so
hit
or
miss
so
its
nice
to
find
a
hit
this
strong
thanks
to
thebrewo
for
this
one
everything
you
want
in
a
black
ipa
here
piney
bitter
hops
literally
like
a
forest
in
the
night
its
malt
base
is
bitter
too
tons
of
roast
bitter
coffee
grinds
with
the
hops
but
lots
of
body
too
rich
but
dry
insanely
flavorful
and
honestly
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
this
year
it
seems
like
the
good
ones
they
do
never
make
it
to
colorado
but
the
hype
around
them
is
real
this
has
a
cocoa
layer
in
it
and
some
oily
properties
despite
its
seeming
duality
between
hops
and
gain
these
elements
make
it
less
bitter
double
jeopardy
and
more
approachable
it
is
different
in
its
dry
finish
though
and
in
its
well
hidden
abv
these
black
ipas
often
come
across
hot
and
this
one
doesnt
at
all
palate
coating
but
not
super
heavy
which
is
nice
i
would
imagine
big
c
strain
hops
although
i
cant
be
sure
not
overly
complex
but
it
doesnt
need
to
be
a
very
easy
drinking
big
beer
and
frankly
one
of
the
more
memorable
ones
from
these
guys
excellent
late
winter
early
spring
seasonality
as
well
oh
and
the
title
is
a
primus
reference
excellence
all
around
so
far
shorts
limited
releases
this
year
have
been
killing
it
over
last
years
looks
black
as
it
claims
to
with
a
tiny
mocha
head
smell
is
of
hops
malt
caught
a
whiff
of
lemon
each
sip
starts
out
like
an
ipa
mouth
full
of
hops
but
with
a
creamy
aftertaste
truly
succeeds
in
being
a
creamy
ipa
unlike
a
hoppy
porter
like
some
other
black
ipas
ive
had
damn
good
dark
ale
with
distinct
hop
aroma
getting
the
apollo
scent
but
im
not
quite
sure
hops
and
coffee
on
the
nose
mouth
feel
is
wet
malty
and
delicious
great
lacing
let
it
sit
as
it
just
gets
better
i
get
black
patent
malts
heavy
with
no
smoke
but
a
coffee
grind
palette
and
a
slight
sweet
maltiness
ibus
are
there
but
not
a
dominant
hop
finish
but
very
crisp
fast
finish
final
word
shorts
did
it
again
this
beer
is
very
good
for
the
style
very
nice
for
its
style
id
buy
it
again
cheers
my
favorite
shorts
beer
by
a
long
shot
pretty
good
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
black
ales
o
good
beer
and
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
nice
combination
of
roated
malts
and
piney
hop
recommended
black
ipas
and
hoppy
stouts
can
fall
into
a
gray
area
where
what
theyre
really
trying
to
achieve
can
be
a
bit
muddled
i
think
this
one
hits
the
target
pretty
well
the
focus
from
the
aroma
through
the
finish
is
on
the
hops
although
the
dark
roasty
malts
are
very
present
o
from
a
brewery
i
havent
been
overly
impressed
with
so
far
this
was
definitely
a
quality
black
ipa
and
one
of
their
better
offerings
that
ive
had
it
had
a
nice
balance
was
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
one
of
the
better
black
ipas
ive
had
and
definitely
worth
trying
o
shorts
has
been
hit
or
miss
lately
i
worry
that
theyre
doing
too
much
by
putting
out
so
many
different
styles
all
the
time
this
however
is
not
one
of
those
misses
i
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
6pack
really
enjoyed
it
and
could
definitely
go
for
another
overall
very
interesting
smelling
black
dipa
that
kind
of
gets
muddled
on
the
palate
perhaps
theres
too
much
clashing
with
each
other
in
terms
of
the
citrusy
hop
flavours
and
strong
dark
malts
still
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
enjoy
it
again
if
presented
with
the
opportunity
overall
shes
a
keeper
in
my
book
a
different
take
on
something
that
is
a
staple
now
in
most
fridges
prost
to
shorts
on
this
one
ive
long
been
a
doubter
of
shorts
brewing
but
having
tried
this
offering
im
a
step
closer
to
being
a
believer
this
ale
pours
a
deep
rich
black
almost
stout
like
with
a
very
slight
tan
head
and
substantial
lacing
the
nose
is
perplexing
there
are
substantial
hop
notes
with
a
good
deal
of
pine
and
grass
along
side
those
of
coffee
and
carmely
roasted
malts
unfortunately
there
is
also
something
slightly
off
and
skunky
in
nature
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clean
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
coating
feel
it
is
actually
lighter
than
i
would
have
guessed
it
to
be
the
flavors
mirror
the
nose
with
a
bitter
piney
hoppiness
upfront
followed
by
a
deep
coffeechocolaty
malty
sweetness
this
is
damn
good
and
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
ive
had
maybe
there
is
hope
for
shorts
yet
overall
good
beer
unique
style
of
beer
you
feel
as
if
your
drinking
two
styles
of
beer
at
once
on
one
hand
you
have
all
of
the
citrusy
goodness
of
an
ipa
and
on
the
other
roasty
characteristics
that
closely
resemble
a
stout
especially
upon
smell
not
dissipointed
glad
i
tried
it
4
255
shorts
purveyor
of
the
gangrenously
whack
this
is
one
of
few
black
ales
that
doesnt
disappoint
perhaps
because
it
goes
right
up
to
the
edge
of
too
much
then
hits
the
accelerator
strange
very
good
notes
i
think
the
hopsmalt
combo
might
have
contributed
to
the
fruity
notes
but
its
also
possible
the
hops
have
faded
a
bit
if
shorts
release
calendar
is
accurate
this
was
released
in
february
my
friend
and
i
both
enjoyed
it
more
than
rage
though
which
is
interesting
o
this
is
the
last
of
the
six
pack
that
was
given
to
me
as
a
bday
present
from
a
buddy
of
mine
all
i
can
say
is
this
is
my
all
time
favorite
black
ipa
and
the
best
offering
i
have
tried
from
shorts
if
you
want
an
awesome
black
ipa
this
is
a
must
try
its
to
bad
this
is
a
seasonal
beer
and
i
will
have
to
wait
almost
another
whole
year
to
get
some
more
this
beer
is
best
fresh
but
with
some
age
on
it
it
smooths
out
considerably
get
this
one
cheers
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
full
on
the
tongue
black
ipas
are
hit
or
miss
for
me
sometimes
but
this
was
really
delicious
especially
with
the
soft
pillowy
mouthfeel
and
hightorque
hop
profiles
pours
a
dark
brown
basically
black
with
a
medium
tan
head
that
goes
down
quickly
scent
is
that
of
a
roasty
porter
or
coffee
stout
a
ton
of
roasted
malt
and
some
dark
malt
with
roasted
hop
aromas
very
interesting
beer
here
this
has
some
hoppy
notes
but
drinks
like
a
wellcrafted
roasty
porter
the
hops
are
just
a
plus
taste
is
just
as
it
smell
roasted
malt
and
hops
with
some
chocolate
and
coffee
espresso
with
coffee
grounds
and
hops
this
beer
is
fantastic
one
of
the
best
black
ipas
and
one
of
the
best
american
black
ales
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
drinkability
is
high
overall
a
very
very
solid
beer
i
would
say
a
close
second
among
black
ipa
just
trailing
stones
15th
anniversary
i
would
recommend
drinking
one
at
a
time
not
only
for
the
abv
but
also
just
to
spread
the
wealth
highly
recommended
drinks
a
lot
like
a
ris
thanks
adam
o
overall
this
is
a
tasty
american
black
ale
it
is
too
much
for
me
right
now
however
maybe
its
spring
however
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
this
right
now
as
fate
would
have
it
i
dumped
34
of
this
beer
on
my
rug
oops
maybe
it
was
predetermined
as
i
wasnt
particularly
interested
overall
this
is
one
bad
mofo
not
quite
the
palate
wrecker
one
might
fear
by
being
a
double
black
ipa
shorts
def
puts
their
skillful
hallmark
on
the
deeep
daaaarrrk
malt
bill
on
this
one
but
never
letting
you
forget
theyre
the
maestros
of
hop
manipulation
either
its
kinda
like
looking
up
at
the
hugest
most
scary
roller
coaster
in
the
park
getting
strapped
in
and
getting
the
ride
you
expected
but
you
didnt
die
you
didnt
even
shit
yourself
you
loved
it
so
much
you
got
back
in
line
and
took
it
for
another
ride
then
you
gleefully
dreamt
about
it
that
night
while
unknowingly
grew
a
bigger
pair
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
black
ipas
but
im
willing
to
try
anything
once
this
beer
is
surprisingly
good
shorts
brewing
has
been
hit
or
miss
imo
but
this
one
is
excellent
a
nice
solid
fairly
malty
backbone
to
complement
the
flavorful
hops
not
too
overwhelming
on
either
the
malt
or
the
well
rounded
hop
profile
i
would
love
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
although
i
would
feel
much
better
about
drinking
it
pretty
fresh
as
i
just
did
good
choice
and
thanks
again
my
favorite
black
ipa

this
was
pretty

that
id

roasted

on
the

with
a

slightly
chalky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
only
a
small
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
imperial
black
ipa
great
balance
and
complexity
of
roasted
malt
and
hop
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
sip
on
a
very
enjoyable
offering
as
expected
o
overall
it
was
definitely
good
although
it
was
far
more
like
a
stout
than
an
ipa
needs
more
balance
o
another
great
outside
the
box
beer
from
shorts
its
difficult
for
me
to
wrap
my
head
around
the
whole
black
ipa
thing
to
go
and
imperialize
it
just
leaves
me
more
confused
all
i
know
is
i
like
this
beer
in
any
event
it
is
a
very
good
beer
get
some
and
enjoy
responsibly
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
theres
no
confusing
this
with
any
other
american
black
ale
its
a
completely
different
animal
its
very
unique
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
went
down
fairly
smooth
and
the
flavors
did
a
great
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
its
a
little
too
intense
to
drink
multiples
of
so
i
think
one
bottle
is
enough
for
me
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
taste
they
were
really
nice
intense
yet
balanced
i
really
liked
that
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
i
cant
say
that
theres
anything
that
i
didnt
like
or
would
want
to
change
about
this
beer
its
great
just
the
way
it
is
i
would
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
if
they
release
it
again
its
already
all
gone
in
my
area
so
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
few
of
these
i
recommend
this
to
anyone
whole
loves
black
ipas
and
all
around
intense
beers
all
in
all
i
was
pretty
impressed
with
this
beer
i
always
expect
good
things
from
shorts
its
what
they
do
but
i
didnt
expect
to
like
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
it
really
won
me
over
shorts
shows
you
can
take
some
robust
malts
and
combine
them
with
some
intense
hops
and
bitterness
and
get
a
great
tasting
yet
well
balanced
beer
that
isnt
dull
in
the
slightest
great
job
shorts
you
guys
continue
to
impress
me
with
your
awesome
and
unique
brews
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
cant
wait
to
see
what
other
new
and
crazy
beers
you
have
waiting
to
be
unveiled
after
plowing
through
my
own
six
pack
i
realized
i
like
this
even
more
than
i
originally
thought
hops
had
faded
a
little
bit
leaving
the
beer
more
stout
like
but
it
was
still
delicious
i
got
more
bitter
cocoa
notes
this
time
that
i
wasnt
getting
before
very
roasted
tasty
and
unique
like
a
stout
that
has
been
overhopped
to
oblivion
a
very
interesting
and
well
made
beer
and
the
first
time
ive
had
a
black
dipa
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
over
the
top
and
as
a
result
one
is
plenty
but
its
still
worth
a
try
i
just
couldnt
see
myself
buying
a
6pack
of
this
appearance
is
a
dark
black
color
with
light
head
and
medium
carbonation
smells
are
heavy
on
citrus
with
some
sweeter
malt
smells
like
molasses
and
raisin
mixed
in
taste
is
that
of
a
very
balanced
malty
ipa
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
thick
for
an
ipa
this
is
very
drinkable
and
tasty
completely
opaque
black
and
with
a
small
tan
head
that
sticks
mostly
to
the
side
of
the
glass
color
reminds
me
a
of
a
stout
or
porter
smells
of
roasted
barley
and
citrusy
hops
some
coffee
and
chocolate
notes
in
there
as
well
taste
has
the
roastiness
somewhat
subdued
and
wellbalanced
with
the
bitterness
and
flavoring
of
the
hops
finishes
dry
with
the
alcohol
wellhidden
it
teeters
on
the
edge
of
being
a
stout
but
not
quite
there
the
hops
are
definitely
in
the
spotlight
here
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
i
like
these
black
barleywines
this
is
a
style
that
i
would
like
to
see
more
maybe
ill
brew
up
a
batch
of
my
own
and
use
this
as
a
standard
this
is
a
good
brew
really
loved
the
feel
on
this
brew
more
than
anything
and
it
brings
all
the
good
qualities
of
this
style
together
real
nice
black
ale
the
outlier
rules
are
annoying
overall
interesting
as
the
cocoa
flavor
adds
complexity
for
such
a
hoppy
beer
ipa
meets
porter
a
good
sipping
beer
another
very
good
beer
from
duck
rabbit
i
wish
this
one
was
more
common
hard
to
find
outside
of
bottle
shops
even
in
nc
would
like
to
see
this
one
on
draft
a
little
more
often
ive
had
it
at
festivals
and
would
order
this
beer
regularly
great
hop
lovers
beer
from
the
dark
beer
specialist
i
mightve
entered
my
rating
a
little
early
as
this
drink
got
better
over
time
right
out
of
the
fridge
the
flavors
seemed
timid
and
not
all
that
complex
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
foretaste
seemed
more
and
more
stouty
while
the
aftertaste
developed
a
hoppier
tone
nice
roasted
malts
up
front
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
very
pleasant
hops
in
the
gullet
dont
confuse
this
with
an
imperial
black
but
do
give
it
a
try
just
let
it
sit
a
while
before
you
make
up
your
mind
based
on
this
beers
name
i
was
expecting
well
something
a
bit
more
hoppy
thats
ok
though
this
beer
was
still
nice
to
drink
it
reminded
me
more
of
a
brown
ale
with
some
nice
nutty
notes
played
too
much
with
my
taste
buds
hoppy
hoppy
hoppy
darky
darky
darky
not
really
my
style
so
take
it
for
what
its
worth
its
a
ipl
all
day
just
happens
to
be
black
its
just
not
my
type
it
taste
like
burnt
malt
mixed
with
water
i
like
duckrabbit
but
this
was
just
not
one
ill
have
again
not
a
bad
beer
but
one
that
favors
the
malts
more
than
the
hops
lovely
dark
brown
almost
black
ale
with
hints
of
coffeechocolate
in
the
smell
and
taste
another
very
good
brew
from
duckrabbit
brewery
eric
overall
solid
beer
that
i
would
go
back
to
but
not
eagerly
overall
drinkability
american
black
ales
are
all
over
the
place
on
style
and
ive
had
some
very
hoppy
american
stouts
cross
over
into
this
flavor
range
that
i
get
with
this
in
fact
if
someone
hadnt
told
me
this
was
an
aba
i
would
have
thought
it
was
a
hoppy
stout
all
that
being
said
good
appearance
flavor
and
mouthfeel
with
this
beer
and
i
could
easily
have
another
one
although
at
that
point
i
could
kiss
the
rest
of
my
evening
away
for
any
sort
of
productivity
part
of
me
wondered
if
the
hops
should
have
been
stronger
and
yet
if
they
were
too
strong
i
think
the
two
flavors
of
hops
and
malts
would
have
been
in
conflict
so
i
think
this
one
was
just
right
even
if
the
two
flavors
were
simple
and
deep
in
flavor
sometimes
too
much
complexity
becomes
a
muddled
mess
so
the
lack
of
complexity
i
think
makes
for
a
better
beer
ill
have
to
revisit
this
beer
sometime
o
very
yummy
though
not
completely
my
style
of
beer
lots
of
flavors
and
an
absolutely
wonderful
aroma
i
think
id
rather
smell
it
than
drink
it
the
coffee
flavor
is
welcome
but
a
little
overpowering
wish
it
had
more
sweetness
to
it
to
fight
the
hops
still
at
least
its
got
character
poured
put
nearly
pitchblack
hard
to
see
any
light
getting
through
it
massive
foamy
tan
head
forms
almost
immediately
almost
like
a
root
beer
float
leaves
big
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
schwarzbier
with
just
a
slight
extra
hint
of
pine
the
taste
is
equally
similar
with
a
nice
earthy
quality
there
is
a
decent
weight
to
the
body
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
a
nice
dark
lightly
hopped
ale
o
duck
rabbit
does
it
again
a
great
brew
smooth
and
up
to
par
with
others
in
this
style
update
tried
this
a
second
time
in
august
of
2014
and
noticed
a
discernible
difference
both
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
were
bolder
than
i
remembered
the
first
time
the
roast
definitely
outpaces
the
hops
but
the
blend
of
the
two
is
quite
tasty
an
upgraded
rating
is
warranted
and
was
completed
by
me
true
to
its
name
its
black
with
a
small
tan
head
that
leaves
only
a
bit
of
lace
it
has
a
beautiful
smokey
scent
really
nice
and
balanced
o
yet
another
beer
i
really
enjoy
from
duck
rabbit
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
a
bit
hoppier
just
because
of
the
name
but
i
love
the
balance
in
this
beer
and
the
roastiness
i
get
from
it
perhaps
the
lesser
hops
are
due
to
it
being
at
the
very
end
of
its
suggested
lifespan
o
if
this
is
this
good
as
its
nearing
its
shelf
life
it
must
be
awesome
when
its
fresh
very
good
as
a
dark
beer
the
hoppy
goodness
is
there
but
not
overpowering
creamy
mouthfeel
is
consistent
with
what
i
expect
from
a
good
dark
beer
the
bitterness
is
not
overpowering
either
it
is
an
interesting
flavor
closer
to
a
stout
than
an
ipa
but
the
best
of
each
d
an
outstanding
american
black
ale
it
should
also
be
noted
that
this
one
scores
nicely
in
terms
of
the
value
proposition
theres
a
lot
of
very
good
things
going
on
here
for
a
rather
economical
price
possibly
my
favorite
duck
rabbit
offering
just
because
they
are
the
dark
beer
specialists
doesnt
mean
they
dont
know
what
to
do
with
some
hops

earth
duck
rabbit
is
a
brewery
that
hardly
disappoints
and
this
venture
into
black
ale
territory
is
no
dissapointment
either
now
this
flavor
is
unique
for
sure
bitterness
from
the
malt
and
hops
bitter
roasted
coffee
dark
bakers
chocolate
and
alpha
acids
medicinal
sort
of
flavor
is
the
only
real
knock
here
black
roasted
malts
underly
what
is
really
a
pine
heads
dream
its
all
really
balanced
and
smooth
surprisngly
o
excellent
and
highly
drinkable
very
tasty
tastes
like
a
lighter
beer
even
in
the
ipa
adventure
pack
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
slick
mouthfeel
bitter
dry
finish
yet
maintains
that
smooth
crisp
drinkability
found
in
most
of
the
harpoon
offerings
overall
nothing
incredibly
mind
blowing
but
definitely
a
well
made
version
of
an
often
times
poor
style
from
most
of
the
major
brewers
versions
ive
tried
in
the
last
year
o
a
good
cascading
pale
ale
id
definitely
have
another
one
the
taste
is
also
malty
slightly
sweet
and
more
more
modestly
bitter
with
a
lingering
finish
i
think
this
aged
well
considering
it
was
probably
not
meant
to
be
aged
excellent
black
ipa
one
of
the
first
i
have
ever
tried
the
taste
is
slightly
spicy
with
smokey
undertones
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
has
a
strong
aftertaste
with
excellent
hoppiness
the
balance
between
spicy
sweet
and
smokey
adds
a
nice
quality
and
makes
this
a
unique
beer
experience
surprisingly
smooth
with
a
nice
drinkable
taste
would
totally
drink
again
overall
a
really
good
black
ipa
when
i
poured
it
into
my
mug
i
took
a
few
minutes
to
just
admire
the
look
and
smell
of
this
poured
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
frothy
tankhaki
color
head
the
smell
is
several
different
aromas
sorta
citrusy
sorta
earthy
the
taste
relatively
matched
that
it
was
a
little
heavy
but
went
down
smooth
nonetheless
very
enjoyable
i
recommend
trying
it
especially
if
you
like
black
ipas
i
would
pay
for
this
again
and
probably
will
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
after
being
disappointed
by
other
black
ipas
i
almost
gave
up
on
the
style
seems
like
not
many
brewers
can
nail
the
balance
just
right
and
harpoon
did
that
pushing
it
out
of
the
category
of
a
porter
without
blasting
you
with
hops
great
beer
highly
recommended
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
nice
black
ipa
that
i
would
drink
again
and
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
well
done
worth
trying
thanks
again
matt
i
would
enjoy
this
in
the
summer
or
winter
this
is
a
really
nice
black
ipa
it
has
an
amazingly
forward
hop
character
that
should
please
any
hop
head
it
also
has
a
nice
well
rounded
malt
character
that
balances
nicely
its
also
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
that
refreshes
its
definitely
worth
a
try
this
hop
taste
is
familiar
but
not
quite
sharp
with
some
citrus
and
tropcical
fruit
with
mostly
pine
taste
in
the
first
sips
with
some
caramel
in
the
malt
coming
through
after
the
swallow
and
light
tannic
roasted
almost
char
taste
in
the
malt
giving
an
acrid
flavor
in
the
finish
with
subtle
alcohol
influence
overall
a
not
bad
example
a
decent
ale
and
has
enough
hop
flavor
to
accept
the
bitter
roasted
taste
pretty
drinkable
in
general
less
bitter
than
most
ipas
but
that
may
be
from
the
stronger
roasted
malts
full
bodied
with
an
above
average
carbonation
level
overall
less
ipa
and
more
deeply
roasted
porter
o
i
love
black
ipas
this
one
is
a
nice
example
with
bitterness
coming
from
both
the
roasted
malts
as
well
as
the
hops
the
body
seems
a
bit
light
and
may
not
be
as
balanced
as
others
ive
tried
but
a
nice
drinking
bipa
none
the
less
bitter
roasted
coffee
up
front
smoother
dark
chocolate
and
roasted
barley
follow
through
hints
of
dark
fruitiness
a
little
smoke
and
peat
as
well
hop
bitterness
comes
out
in
the
latter
half
of
the
palate
nice
blend
of
leafy
piny
and
citrus
earthy
tobacco
shows
up
in
the
finish
along
with
some
cocoa
dries
out
a
little
mediumfull
body
with
a
slightly
syrupy
feel
nicely
done
o
very
drinkable

i
could
have
a
few
more
in
fact
i
will
o
great
black
ipa
should
try
this
one
the
strong
hop
presence
is
what
makes
it
stand
out
above
other
overly
sweet
black
ipas
o
a
nice
black
ipa
without
too
much
roast
character
but
enough
of
a
dark
malt
presence
to
make
it
into
a
good
aba
after
the
nose
this
definitely
leans
more
towards
the
ipa
side
which
is
a
good
thing
solid
brew
glad
they
brought
it
back
i
am
not
a
lover
of
this
brewery
mainly
because
of
too
many
disappointments
vs
successes
so
coming
from
a
real
skeptic
they
nailed
this
one
hops
are
perfectly
balanced
with
the
malt
and
even
a
hophead
would
feel
satisfied
malt
isnt
overdone
with
raw
bitterness
instead
the
stuff
you
want
in
this
style
shines
good
job
fellas
o
nice
roast
character
and
an
interesting
bitterness
the
profile
isnt
common
but
not
necessarily
complex

with
some

good

the

theres

really
being
fleshed
out
any

fully

doesnt
have
much
appeal
though
i
love
the

but
this
particular

misses
the
mark
d
it
isnt
bad
it
isnt
terribly
good
though
no
harpoon
product
ive
had
belonged
in
a
higher
class
than
the
average
beer
drinkers
table
but
black
ipa
is
a
very
strong
example
of
its
style
and
certainly
warrants
as
much
respect
as
many
of
those
higher
rated
than
it
i
would
have
been
very
upset
if
this
bomber
were
only
12
ounces
and
even
after
22
ounces
i
would
have
enjoyed
a
little
more
o
easily
drinkable
good
but
not
great
black
ipa
smells
and
tastes
really
seem
to
change
from
sip

sip
with
some
complex
and
some
very
plain
not

why
would
have
rated
higher
if
more
consistent

some

about

black

is
a
very
dim
reddish
brown
almost
black
beer
with
a
lumpy
beige
foam
on

the
retention
and

are
outstanding
it
has
a
bold
fresh
aroma

pine

grapefruit
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
it
has
a
very
smooth

please
brew
this
one
again
overall
im
not
too
pleased
with
this
one
its
fairly
onenote
and
weak
in
the
malt
and
hop
department
making
for
a
beer
thats
actually
less
than
the
some
of
its
part
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
a
deep
dark
chocolate
brown
color
a
nice
tight
one
finger
beige
colored
head
atop
that
lasted
in
a
pillow
state
for
quite
awhile
piney
hops
stood
nicely
over
top
of
roast
and
unsweetened
chocolate
malt
notesthe
flavors
dont
really
pack
any
op
punch
honestly
to
me
its
like
a
earthy
porter
with
its
light
bitter
chocolate
and
raw
earthy
finishit
lacks
really
any
hop
character
the
beer
started
out
promising
but
the
lack
of
hop
depth
on
the
palate
really
brought
the
score
down
for
meits
not
true
to
style
flavor
wise
a
beer
worth
trying
but
not
my
favorite
overall
it
is
a
pleasant
ale
and
worth
drinking
but
it
is
no
knock
your
socks
off
representative
of
a
new
style
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
51512
this
pours
a
light
black
color
with
a
little
red
hues
around
the
edges
along
with
a
nice
tan
colored
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
smells
are
full
of
pine
hops
along
with
dark
roasted
malts
the
feel
is
medium
and
full
of
bitter
hop
resin
the
taste
is
pretty
good
it
follows
the
more
stout
ipa
hybrid
of
this
style
the
hop
presence
is
there
full
of
that
bitterness
along
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
bitterness
for
extra
goodness
love
it
overall
im
happy
to
have
grabbed
a
bottle
of
this
during
my
visit
a
very
drinkable
uniquely
hopped
take
on
the
style
o
ive
only
had
a
few
black
ipas
and
this
probably
ranks
around
the
middle
of
them
it
wasnt
overly
flavorful
but
had
a
typical
black
ipa
taste
sort
of
a
not
overly
hoppy
ipa
with
the
sweet
characteristic
taste
similar
to
other
darker
beers
such
as
stouts
definitely
could
have
used
a
little
bit
more
flavor
preferred
if
it
was
a
little
bit
sweeter
maybe
a
little
bit
more
hops
not
a
bad
beer
goes
down
easy
but
definitely
room
for
improvement
would
drink
again
but
probably
wouldnt
spend
the
money
to
buy
a
bottle
the
mouth
is
creamy
as
well
but
with
a
crisp
carbonation
bite
at
each
sip
wonderful
citrus
in
this
one
bitterness
is
moderate
but
man
does
it
keep
me
sipping
mild
roasted
characteristics
but
this
is
mostly
bitter
and
citrusysweet
the
black
in
this
one
is
relegated
mainly
to
the
color
rather
than
the
flavor
profile
still
this
is
one
i
would
have
time
and
again
good
beer

a
nice
pleasant
brew
i
enjoyed
this
brew
right
next

with

loose
and
creamy
overall
a
pretty
decent
brew
went
down
smooth
and
quickly
not
too
shabby
overall
this
is
a
fine
black
ipa
it
lacks
some
of
the
roasted
notes
that
make
an
excellent
black
ipa
in
that
way
it
falls
into
the
category
of
black
ipas
that
are
black
because
of
their
color
and
not
as
much
based
on
flavor
if
you
gave
me
this
on
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
not
necessary
think
it
was
a
black
ipa
that
said
i
would
still
consider
it
to
be
a
perfectly
acceptable
ipa
in
our
little
minitour
of
black
ipas
over
the
last
3
weeks
i
would
consider
this
one
a
solid
second
which
is
a
fine
place
to
be
when
one
of
the
other
beers
is
otter
creeks
black
ipa
had
this
as
the
100
barrel
series
40
in
a
large

an
underrated

throughout
full

brew
with
medium

relatively
easy

could
have
this
again
no
problem
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
there
are
better
options
in
the
style
overall
this
one
is
ok
to
good
but
definitely
finished
behind
uinta
in
my
black
ale
night
i
would
pick
this
up
again
as
it
is
enjoyable
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
i
would
choose
first
o
just
on
ok
beer
slightly
above
average
gotta
give
it
that
nothing
too
special
though
worth
the
try
but
i
doubt
i
would
drop
8
dollars
on
the

again

overall
i
liked
it
but
didnt
think
it
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
hop
bitterness
was
overshadowed
by
sweetness
which
made
it
more
balanced
but
neutered
the
beer
it
kind
of
made
me
think
of
a
slightly
hopped
up
american
brown
ale
rather
than
an
ipa
of
any
stripe
not
a
bad
beer
two
things
though
the
heavy
ash
taste
and
lack
of
hop
flavor
could
use
work
there
o
another
good
black
ipa
nothing
earth
shattering
but
wellworth
the
money
might
buy
again
d
overall
a
really
nice
beer
nice
mix
of
flavors

it
was
quite
drinkable

the

flavor
is
all
ipa
and
only
in
the
very
end
is
there
any
hint
of
roasted
malt
i
do
feel
like
the
beer
might
be
excessively
dry
given
the
relatively
high
ibus
and
abvs
this
beer
really
showcases
just
two
things
loads
of
hops
and
a
contrasting
black
body
but
other
than
that
its
just
an
average
if
high
alcohol
cda
this
stuff
is
dark
brownblack
in
color
with
a
hefty
tan
head
and
big
bubbled
lacing
the
aroma
brings
herbal
swamp
hops
and
skunky
wheat
not
bad
the
flavor
brings
much
the
same
with
weak
herbal
hops
over
somewhat
watery

mediumlight
bodied
with
a
somewhat
aqueous
feel
medium
carbonation
good
but
underwhelming
not
the
best
of
the
100

series
but
definitely
a
good
value
taste
is
dark
malts
to
start
moderate
citrus
in
the
middle
and
comes
on
pine
bitterness
galore
through
to
the
close
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
drinkability
is
okay
as
well
seems
somewhat
scattered
like
a
black
ipa
with
add
almost
no
aroma
then
hops
everywhere
in
my
mouth
wish
it
was
a
bit
more
consistent
creamy
and
full
mouthfeel
slight
suggestion
of
tannins
overall
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
beer
o
ok
i
prefer
a
bit
more
body
and
some
chocolate
malt
character
in
my
abas
but
if
you
go
into
this
thinking
youre
going
to
be
drinking
a
hoppy
porter
you
would
likely
be
less
disappointed
than
i
was
6
99
for
the
bomber
makes
this
a
decent
value
o
this
is
not
one
of
the
better
examples
of
an
aba
it
does
not
have
nearly
the
power
or
complexity
of
other
beers
of
the
style
its
pretty
much
an
acceptable
ipa
with
a
touch
of
the
black
this
is
often
what
black
ipas
turn
out
to
be
for
me
not
a
favorite
for
the
style
or
harpoon
despite
the
aforementioned
flaws
it
does
come
together
fairly
nicely
a
decent
example
that
i
feel
is
lacking
in
hoppiness
its
still
balanced
enough
to
where
you
can
enjoy
it
overall
a
tasty
beer
but
a
little
modest
for
the
category
malt
seems
a
bit
weak
the
hops
dont
punch
the
roasted
malt
seems
just
for
color
almost
sessionable
where
i
expected
a
bit
more
of
a
celebration
beer
still
a
pleasant
flavorful
beer
that
ill
enjoy
as
i
make
my
way
through
the
bottle
there
is
a
metallic
astringency
that
becomes
fairly
unpleasant
its
not
awful
but
after
a
while
its
all
i
can
focus
on
a
disappointing
end
to
a
beer
id
been
looking
forward
to
trying
o
pretty
good
stuff
personally
id
like
to
see
it
ramped
up
a
bit
a
la
hoppy

and
be
rolled
in
to
the
leviathan

as
it
stands

profile
simply
to
carry
the
hops
tasty
but
could
use
a
semblance
of
malt
flavor
still
very
nice
instead
of
picking
up
the
aromas
of
chocolate
and
coffee
from
most
stouts
this
black
ipa
gave
you
an
complete
overload
of
hops
but
not
overdone
instead
it
was
really
balanced
the
fullness
of
the
black
beer
combined
with
the
hops
and
malt
made
this
one
very
good
interesting
beer
pour
produces
an
almost
opaque
colored
body
with
a
small
amount
of
tan
head
on
top
aroma
contains
notes
of
floral
hops
with
a
trailing
roastyness
of
grain
flavor
contains
a
center
of
flowery
and
citrisy
hop
bitterness
caramel
malt
mingles
well
with
the
hop
flavoring
tobacco
mixes
in
finish
provides
increased
spice
on
the
palate
increased
carbonation
bite
and
black
patent
malt
roast
that
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
aftertaste
also
leaves
plenty
an
abundance
of
spicey
hop
flavor
on
the
palate
overall
quite
a
solid
brew
from
harpoons
100
barrel
series
very
delicious
drink
this
one
now
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
black
with
ruby
highlights
when
held
up
to
light
a
thick
frothy
foamy
one
inch
head
that
is
offwhite
and
big
bubbled
the
head
clings
all
over
the
glass
as
you
move
the
beer
around
a
bit
aromas
are
rich
cedar
and
pine
with
a
slight
roasting
and
a
decent
resiny
presence
the
beers
flavors
are
dry
with
a
hoppy
blast
of
pine
tree
and
earthy
notes
as
well
as
a
steady
tang
of
citrus
throughout
the
beer
has
a
roasting
character
throughout
it
and
that
transitions
directly
into
the
aftertaste
along
with
an
earthy
and
grainy
profile
the
finish
is
quick
with
only
a
slight
linger
to
it
a
bit
astringent
at
the
end
from
the
hops
cleaning
the
palate
good
beer
the
appearance
is
a
nice
opaque
black
the
nose
is
a
dominant
pine
and
the
taste
follows
up
on
that
with
some
slight
cocoa
and
coffe
very
easy
drinking
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
pours
a
slick
black
with
a
fluffy
3
inch
cream
colored
head
with
lots
of
lace
and
nice
retention
smell
is
piny
hops
citrus
hints
of
chocolate
and
some
bread
taste
is
all
of
that
with
citrus
and
chocolate
the
dominant
flavors
with
a
burst
of
pine
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
very
easy
drinking
plenty
of
life
and
really
lush
for
the
style
i
was
really
excited
to
find
this
today
and
be
the
first
to
review
a
very
nice
version
of
a
style
i
love
