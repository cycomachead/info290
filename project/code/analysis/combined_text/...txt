on
tap
not
your
moms
heffe
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
the
presence
of
ginger
bends
to
the
east
of
the
refresh
heading
my
mind
was
set
for
it
slips
by
the
nose
detection
system
even
evades
the
taste
buds
but
gets
all
the
way
to
the
back
palate
then
thumbs
its
nose
over
the
shoulder
like
a
gatecrasher
thats
the
other
side
of
the
barricade
merely
worth
a
shrug
a
wait
see
to
find
what
may
be
added
to
the
party
imo
not
much
in
fact
it
may
be
adding
to
a
cloying
aftertaste
that
detracts
from
the
usual
refreshment
i
get
from
straight
up
heffes
going
rougue
in
this
case
got
a
bit
off
the
reservation
but
perhaps
thats
their
point
in
conclusion
this
did
grow
on
me
but
then
again
so
does
moss
where
the
sun
dont
shine
o
a
tame
spiced
hefe
to
light
and
lingering
bitterness
almost
akin
to
the
pleasant
spiciness
of
ginger
nice
breadiness
and
wheat
flavors
sweet
twang
of
rose
tips
might
assist
hop
bitterness
as
well
really
great
springtime
beer
more
of
american
pale
wheat
than
typical
hefe
or
wit
but
highly
drinkable
beer
due
to
how
the
mouthfeel
compliments
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
36
oz
mug
sweet
smell
and
robust
wheat
flavors
for
a
hefeweizen
no
bubblegum
or
banana
flavors
like
other
hefeweizens
much
more
of
a
wheat
and
sweet
cream
flavor
with
hints
of
lemon
very
drinkable
and
very
good
if
you
like
wheat
beer
great
mouth
feel
not
to
much
carbonation
subtle
flavor
good
wheat
taste
with
notes
of
cream
or
cream
soda
a
little
sweet
also
no
to
chewy
like
one
would
think
of
a
hef
its
a
little
on
the
pricy
side
but
you
get
allot
and
the
flavor
is
well
worth
it
also
love
supporting
local
west
coast
breweries
o
this
beer
neither
tastes
like
a
hefeweizen
nor
a
witbierit
seems
to
resemble
more
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
because
it
lacks
banana
esters
and
flavors
of
coriander
overall
an
alright
brew
but
noting
too
exciting
worth
a
try
but
not
one
i
will
likely
come
back
to
again
bright
yellow
in
color
with
a
slight
haze
poured
with
a
big
frothy
white
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
thick
white
cap
fresh
earthy
springlike
grass
zest
of
lemon
and
light
corriander
aromas
with
a
bready
malty
aroma
beneath
medium
bodied
smooth
and
slighty
creamy
down
the
middle
with
rich
smooth
carbonation
around
the
edges
biscuity
and
wheat
malt
backbone
from
the
beginning
through
the
middle
zest
of
lemon
and
spice
flavors
from
the
start
through
the
middle
with
a
spicy
ginger
flavors
toward
the
end
finishes
crisply
with
a
brief
spiciness
not
as
spicy
as
the
typical
wit
and
rogue
calls
this
a
hefe
either
way
it
was
freshrefreshing
spring
ale
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
very
good
i
would
totally
have
it
again
overall
a
good
beer
but
it
tastes
more
like
a
wit
than
a
hefeweizen
overall
much
better
than
the
halfeweizen
i
remember
having
a
good
89
years
ago
perhaps
the
addition
of
rose
has
given
this
a
sweeter
more
palatable
flavor
the
name
is
misleading
this
is
not
a
hefeweizen
why
not
make
it
a
true
hefe
by
using
the
weizen
yeast
they
use
for
the
roguenbier
rye
they
brew
its
beyond
me
regardless
this
is
a
solid
drinkable
wheat
beer
its
currently
categorized
as
a
witbier
and
based
on
flavor
profile
id
say
thats
about
right
id
consider
this
a
once
a
year

this
is
a

witbier
style
good
balance
of
malt

and
fruity

flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
pleasantly
enjoyable
offering
o
i
can
appreciate
the
flavor
profile
knowing
that
its
not
supposed
to
be
a
straightup
hefe
but
it
still
falls
short
of
great
wont
seek
out
again
overall
this
beer
was
kinda
disappointing
i
had
higher
expectations
for
it
based
on
who
brewed
it
i
think
the
rose
petals
add
a
something
to
the
taste
but
its
hard
to
place
it
i
enjoyed
it
but
there
is
not
much
to
it
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
finish
is
medium
this
beer
has
a
wonderful
nose
sadly
the
taste
does
not
match
that
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
fall
day
was
expecting
more
of
a
hefe
than
a
wit
i
suppose
halfaweizen
wouldve
given
that
away
sharp
and
quite
drinkable
beer
nice
bit
of
foam
and
pleasantly
sprizty
in
the
mouth
a
little
more
body
than
many
light
wheats
from
the
22
oz
bottle
im
not
old
enough
to
of
tied
an
onion
to
my
belt
for
fashion
purposes
but
i
can
say
that
mom
hefeweizen
or
halfeweizen
as
we
called
it
back
in
my
day
used
to
be
a
much
better
beer
if
nothing
else
this
is
a
lesson
from
the
if
aint
broke
dont
fix
it
school
if
the
good
people
at
rogue
had
any
true
reverence
for
mom
theyd
of
left
things
as
they
were
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
ambergolden
color
with
nice
off
white
2
finger
head
unfiltered
with
some
residue
smell
is
not
too
big
some
fruit
and
a
touch
of
honey
a
little
disappointing
taste
is
a
little
bit
more
complex
with
cloves
grains
wheat
apricots
and
ginger
some
good
citrus
hit
on
the
front
which
were
nice
feel
is
a
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
a
tad
dry
and
crispy
overall
an
intersting
take
on
the
style
says
hefe
on
the
bottle
but
is
classified
as
a
witbier
liked
the
apricot
touch
and
the
fruit
blend
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
and
would
like
to
see
more
hop
balance
difficult
to
compare
to
others
as
this
is
a
hybrid
imo
would
drink
another
one
but
not
fantastic
interesting
though
o
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
in
fact
its
rather
tasty
but
tends
more
towards
pale
ale
characteristic
rather
than
witbier
in
my
opinion
really
not
a
bad
wheat
beer
the
flavor
is
nice
and
it
could
be
a
decent
quaffer
on
a
hot
day
id
prefer
it
to
be
a
little
lighter
in
body
and
its
not
overly
complex
but
its
a
decent
beer
overall
just
dont
go
into
it
expecting
a
hefeweizen
even
if
the
label
tells
you
thats
what
youre
about
to
get
worth
a
try
at
least
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
monster
white
head
theres
also
a
bunch
of
little
particles
swimming
around
in
this
one
the
taste
and
smell
match
it
is
quite
spicy
and
has
a
nice
fruitiness
to
it
there
is
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
as
well
as
a
tiny
bit
of
dark
fruits
a
lot
of
wheat
in
here
obviously
it
really
dominates
the
nose
and
palate
as
well
as
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
it
is
rather
smooth
has
a
full
body
and
really
high
carbonation
not
rogues
best
offering
in
my
opinion
but
not
quite
a
disappointment
c
picked
up
a
bottle
of
mom
because
it
sounded
interesting
poured
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
slightly
hazy
goldenrod
coloring
with
a
tall
fluffy
light
white
head
that
settles
quickly
into
only
a
trace
of
film
aromas
of
toasted
grains
with
a
hint
of
rose
the
beers
flavors
are
toasted
cereal
initially
with
a
sharpness
to
it
that
makes
it
a
bit
hard
to
drink
subtle
buttery
and
floral
highlights
come
through
at
the
end
of
the
palate
but
just
barely
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
a
touch
on
the
astringent
side
the
finish
is
quick
roasted
and
slightly
dry
overall
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
yeasty
brew
that
had
a
touch
of
spiciness
and
a
nice
floral
twist
in
fact
this
is
what
makes
this
beer
different
than
other
hefeweizens
o
very
disappointed
everything
was
bland
and
tasted
weak
and
watered
down
dunno
if
i
just
got
a
lemon
with
this
bottle
ill
prob
try
another
one
and
would
def
love
to
try
it
on
tap
to
compare
just
had
to
try
this
one
on
mothers
day
wheaty
aroma
has
a
strong
yeasty
overtone
it
smells
very
much
like
a
packet
of
brewers
yeast
no
surprise
there
eh
pours
a
clear
solar
yellow
with
a
typical
white
head
flavor
is
wheaty
with
just
a
whisper
of
lemon
and
a
whisper
of
grass
smooth
texture
has
average
body
and
just
a
little
fizz
ive
had
better
but
this
is
palatable
happy
mothers
day
rogue
mom
hefeweizen
with
rose
petals
wish
i
would
have
left
this
22ouncer
on
the
shelf
could
have
saved
7
99
or
spent
5
25
of
that
on
the
hitachino
nest
weizen
beer
which
i
thought
was
flagrantly
overpriced
especially
for
an
11
2oz
bottle
thats
not
even
from
the
same
continent
as
germany
as
a
witbier
its
unmemorable
if
it
was
hoppier
a
plus
if
it
was
fruitier
a
plus
if
it
was
spicier
a
plus
its
none
of
these
things
oh
well
ill
choose
wisely
next
time
3
0
o
on
the
whole
this
is
a
very
average
beer
thats
easily
forgotten
o
carbonation
keeps
this
beer
from
cloying
and
the
ginger
is
a
nice
addition
the
finish
has
a
slight
bitter
edge
that
keeps
the
beer
from
sweetness
it
is
enjoyable
to
drink
o
a
pretty
good
beer
like
the
flavors
and
the
aroma
i
noticed
that
the
flavors
and
the
aroma
were
very
good
but
tame
wish
they
could
have
been
a
tiny
bit
stronger
extremely
light
and
crisp
kind
of
bland
though
touch
of
wheat
faint
yeast
bite
but
mostly
very
very
clean
faint
floral
flavor
short
concise
and
below
par
unfortunately
refreshing
at
least
o
really
didnt
impress
me
mom
should
beef
up
her
carbonation
and
forget
about
the
rose
petals
too
light
for
my
taste
and
my
wifes
less
on
fruity
but
big
on
spicy
the
coriander
and
ginger
do
their
job
well
in
tempting
the
palate
so
drinkable
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
definitely
straddles
the
belgian
hefe
line
o
didnt
quite
come
together
for
me
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
needs
some
tweaking
overall
a
rare
dissapointment
from
rogue
d
very
drinkable
overall
it
was
a
pretty
cool
idea
that
yielded
a
good
beer
it
took
my
favorite
parts
from
each
beer
type
hefeweizens
and
witbiers
and
tied
them
together
as
other
reviewers
have
already
noted
this
is
a
brew
pretending
to
be
a
hefeweizen
so
many
of
the
traditional
flavors
of
that
style
are
missing
or
distorted
but
that
doesnt
mean
that
the
brew
isnt
worth
trying
just
be
aware
that
youre
getting
more
of
a
fruitandspice
ale
with
a
decent
hops
kick
nicely
done
albeit
very
light
and
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
me
i
still
think
it
fit
rather
well
light
yellow
in
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
huge
fizzy
white
head
that
let
down
quickly
aroma
is
light
banana
clove
and
citrus
nice
and
light
and
airy
with
touches
of
lemon
zest
and
fresh
spice
as
it
warms
very
clean
taste
perfect
hints
of
citrus
and
spice
layered
on
the
banana
based
malts
quick
clean
light
and
very
drinkable
final
thought
5
a
22oz
and
under
5
abv
it
is
worth
it
if
you
like
wheat
beers
otherwise
move
on
funny
bottle
though
drinkability
this
is
what
i
get
for
buying
a
7
bottle
of
hefeweizen
brewed
by
hop
heads
it
is
drinkable
but
it
is
no
hefeweizen
it
is
more
of
a
witbierpale
ale
hybrid
this
is
almost
the
antithesis
of
the
hefeweizen
light
fruitiness
with
an
emphasis
and
malt
and
bitterness
rather
than
wheat
and
yeast
interesting
on
tap
at
churchkey
poured
into
sampler
glass
pours
a
filtered
bright
gold
beer
with
an
ample
dense
foamy
white
head
providing
decent
lacing
aromas
of
doughy
malts
fresh
coriander
and
mild
citrus
flavors
of
restrained
sweet
malts
with
ginger
on
the
midpalate
and
a
clean
dry
hop
bitterness
to
the
finish
quite
light
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
it
is
nothing
like
an
authentic
bavarian
hefe
but
still
works
well
as
a
kind
of
lighter
belgian
blonde
inspired
ale
after
drinking
this
beer
more
i
realize
that
there
is
a
very
tart
taste
to
this
beer
i
looked
on
the
bottle
and
it
says
brewed
with
ginger
so
maybe
that
is
why
maybe
the
ginger
is
what
the
harsh
mouthfeel
is
too
im
not
digging
the
tartness
but
its
not
the
end
of
the
world
overall
ok
but
i
dont
care
for
the
bitter
aftertaste
o
not
the
best
ive
ever
had
but
not
overly
disappointing
this
would
be
something
that
i
would
definitely
prescribe
to
someone
new
to
craft
beers
good
starter
beer
drinkability
hefeweizen
should
be
pretty
simple
to
make
and
get
right
i
think
rogue
missed
the
target
on
this
interpretation
its
one
of
the
least
interesting
american
hefeweizens
ive
tried
its
not
horrible
but
its
not
anything
special
either
note
belgian
style
blonde
on
their
website
really
now
this
beer
is
a
cute
though
homeless
orphan
o
one
of
the
most
uninteresting
witbiers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
thats
too
bad
but
unlike
many
of
my
peeps
i
really
dig
rogues
stuff
overall
this
witbier
poured
out
as
a
cloudy
yellow
with
some
sediment
floating
through
out
till
it
settled
at
the
bottom
the
head
was
pretty
big
white
and
fluffy
the
aromas
were
slightly
grainy
and
had
a
little
bit
of
citrus
in
there
too
the
flavor
i
felt
was
pretty
weak
i
know
that
ive
had
stronger
flavor
wits
before
this
beers
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
on
the
light
side
as
well
its
ok
but
i
wasnt
very
impressed
with
it
drinkability
it
pretty
much
laughs
at
it
you
could
drink
this
all
day
all
in
all
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
rogue
tends
to
be
really
hit
or
miss
for
me
but
this
one
is
a
miss
hopefully
my
super
bowl
beers
go
up
from
here
d
definitely
a
solid
beer
but
memorable
only
for
its
smell
and
its
lack
of
any
defining
taste
this
would
go
a
long
way
on
a
hot
day
but
it
fizzled
out
a
bit
at
the
end
for
me
close
but
not
quite
there
d
great
drinkability
probably
one
of
the
sweetest
beers
i
have
had
sadly
this
was
a
mediocre
beer
at
best
and
whilst
its
a
long
way
away
from
being
a
dog
of
a
brew
its
hard
to
find
any
glorious
features
quartereweizen
perhaps
served
with
an
orange
wedge
which
i
promptly
threw
away
this
beer
pours
a
pale
orange
color
with
a
little
haziness
to
it
and
very
little
head
the
smell
is
weak
with
some
banana
and
fruit
esters
the
taste
opens
up
with
spice
and
orange
peel
and
finishes
with
a
slight
banana
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
and
seems
overcarbonated
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
decently
sized
white
head
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
wheat
and
spices
it
is
lacking
the
traditional
bananaclove
smell
you
can
taste
the
wheat
coriander
and
ginger
this
rogue
offering
is
more
bitter
than
a
typical
hefewizen
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
average
carbonation
overall
it
could
be
a
fine
beer
but
it
is
certainly
not
what
i
expected
for
a
hefewizen
d
glad
it
wasnt
skunked
or
terrible
tasting
for
2
99
if
you
can
find
it
fresh
and
can
somehow
tell
it
would
be
a
fantastic
brew
very
nice
its
pretty
drinkable
if
youre
rich
i
had
no
problem
getting
rid
of
the
22
ounce
bottle
i
bought
but
for
6
49
i
wont
be
getting
a
second
one
any
time
soon
there
are
far
too
many
offerings
right
now
for
much
cheaper
and
frankly
many
of
them
are
much
better
as
well
overall
this
beer
is
a
bit
disappointing
overall
an
interesting
beer
i
would
suggest
at
least
trying
it
but
this
is
definitely
not
something
i
would
have
on
a
regular
basis
taste
spicy
ginger
like
flavor
i
thught
this
was
a
german
style
guess
not
calling
this
a
hefeweizen
is
an
insult
to
the
style
its
a
spiced
wheat
ale
ok
its
decent
im
not
crazy
about
it
but
if
i
were
grading
this
as
a
hefe
scores
would
drop
in
each
aspect
i
would
definitely
say
this
isnt
a
highpoint
of
what
i
have
seen
from
rogue
overall
this
is
a
very
mediocre
hefe
d
im
all
about
this
great
summer
beer
swirl
poured
the
bomber
into
a
glass
mug
a
fluffy
bright
white
head
on
a
hazy
gold
the
head
soon
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
good
lacing
smells
of
coriander
and
spices
tastes
of
lemon
and
coriander
the
strong
lemon
is
a
bit
of
a
surprise
i
detect
no
ginger
but
it
is
listed
as
an
ingredient
a
bit
of
a
bitter
finish
medium
body
drinkability
suffers
from
the
finish
but
still
not
bad
overall
an
interesting
beer
but
certainly
not
stylistically
usually
rather
refreshing
d
not
very
good
beer
i
am
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
in
hawaii
as
i
have
not
seen
it
where
i
live
in
california
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
i
would
not
search
it
out
but
would
buy
it
occasionally
if
it
was
readily
available
to
me
d
not
that
great
of
a
hefeweizen
not
much
at
all
to
the
smell
and
taste
was
a
lot
of
wheat
and
bread
easy
to
drink
but
would
probably
not
have
again
just
looked
at
the
style
on
this
one
and
its
noted
as
a
witbier
of
course
the
bottle
of
mom
hefeweizen
says
otherwise
thinking
about
it
in
retrospect
its
style
certainly
is
closer
to
a
witbier
doesnt
really
change
the
review
that
much
for
me
though
split
a
bomber
with
a
friend
they
werent
a
big
fan
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
wheat
has
a
smooth
lightly
caramel
character
certainly
darker
than
most
wits
the
gentle
malts
are
then
complimented
by
the
ginger
and
coriander
though
the
ginger
is
significantly
bigger
than
the
coriander
decent
atmosphere
appearance
is
pretty
nondescript
nose
does
have
some
nice
spice
components
that
stand
out
a
bit
the
palette
is
mostly
the
spice
components
as
with
most
of
this
style
the
grain
components
are
pretty
nondistinct
the
spice
really
adds
some
interesting
character
to
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
drinkability
this
one
is
not
complex
but
sometimes
its
the
simple
things
in
life
that
can
also
be
the
most
rewarding
this
would
be
perfect
for
any
gathering
or
activity
that
involves
the
heat
the
outdoors
a
body
of
water
and
a
ice
cold
cooler
enjoy
its
apparently
mom
approved
good
drinkability
quite
a
nice
beer
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
light
and
refreshing
but
with
a
good
flavor
d
not
my
favorite
but
very
easy
to
drink
d
decent
drinkability
pairs
well
with
comfort
food
and
a
great
summer
brew

cheers
halfeweizen
was
a
light
yet
flavorfull
beer
it
poured
a
rich
golden
color
and
there
wasnt
too
much
of
a
smell
to
it
it
tasted
pretty
similar
to
other
witbier
but
just
a
tad
more
flavorfull
very
easy
to
drink
and
not
much
of
a
aftertaste
deffently
worth
a
try
notes
not
really
a
lot
of
carbonation
which
was
also
disappointing
maybe
i
picked
up
an
old
bottle
opaque
yelloworange
in
colour
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
the
head
is
pretty
retentive
and
leaves
a
fine
lace
on
the
walls
of
my
glass
mild
aroma
of
ginger
fruit
and
baking
bread
it
smells
very
tame
compared
to
the
in
your
face
ginger
aroma
of
the
albino
python
i
had
yesterday
im
not
surprised
that
the
ginger
flavour
in
this
is
more
canada
dry
compared
to
albino
pythons
jamaican
ginger
beer
the
rogue
is
much
more
subtle
with
coriander
and
doughy
malt
holding
the
ginger
to
supporting
role
mild
lemony
tang
very
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
spicy
and
grassy
hop
flavour
i
wouldnt
call
it
bland
but
i
would
like
it
a
little
bit
bolder
almost
medium
bodied
with
fine
spritzy
carbonation
feels
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
wish
they
had
gone
a
bit
more
rogue
with
the
use
of
ginger
aroma
of
citrus
and
spices
and
it
pour
out
of
the
22
oz
bottle
a
cloud
golden
color
i
was
craving
a
wheat
beer
but
this
had
a
weak
flavor
with
some
spices
i
can
taste
the
yeast
somewhat
overall
it
is
not
what
i
wanted
at
the
time
but
would
be
a
nice
crisp
summer
brew
overall
flavorful
light
easy
drinking
session
beer
not
especially
memorable
i
expected
more
but
found
it
average
at
best
probably
best
served
cold
in
the
heat
of
summer
where
taste
may
matter
less
as
are
most
of
this
type
its
extremely
drinkable
then
again
i
expected
a
bit
more
from
rogue
and
although
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
well
made
it
isnt
particularly
creative
a
very
refreshing
wellmade
hefewitbier
quite
a
great
example
of
the
style
w
full
flavor
and
pleasant
suprise
drinkability
all
in
all
a
classic
hefeweizen
made
in
the
typical
richer
american
style
a
really
nice
intro
beer
or
a
great
refresher
for
those
not
wanting
anything
heavy
or
with
noticeable
hoppiness
drinkability
a
decent
hefeweizenwitbier
depending
on
who
you
ask
either
way
it
has
the
requisite
crisp
refreshing
taste
but
not
much
else
worth
a
try
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
one
mine
had
the
mom
moniker
straw
yellow
color
with
haze
wheaty
citrus
and
clove
with
a
hint
of
banana
although
the
scents
were
fairly
subdued
didnt
notice
the
ginger
on
the
nose
to
be
honest
i
struggled
to
taste
it
as
well
hints
of
bubblegum
and
banana
but
the
were
just
that
hints
there
just
really
wasnt
alot
going
on
take
it
or
leave
it
its
not
bad
though
try
it
rogue
has
better
things
to
offer
keep
that
in
mind
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
yeast
hops
pale
malt
and
slight
pine
fits
the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
thick
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
citrus
lime
hops
sweet
malt
and
yeast
overall
a
decent
hef
that
was
heavy
on
hops
and
bitterness
d
this
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
but
this
isnt
a
typical
style
of
beer
for
rogue
and
really
not
one
of
my
favorites
if
i
had
to
choose
id
stick
with
their
other
offerings
drinkability
is
quite
nice
and
certainly
lends
itself
to
hot
weather
not
as
drinkable
as
other
unfiltered
wheats
the
spice
kicks
it
up
a
notch
theres
more
complexity
in
the
taste
but
its
not
as
smooth
throughout
still
a
good
brew
picked
up
a
bomber
at
jungle
jims
in
fairfield
at
1
99
pours
a
hazey
orange
with
a
head
that
dissipates
quickly
tastes
like
seltzer
water
with
honeyginger
and
coriander
mixed
in
overall
im
not
too
big
of
a
fan
might
be
because
its
an
old
bottlebut
even
then
ive
had
older
hefes
that
have
had
more
flavor
than
this
halfeweizen
is
a
good
name
i
guess
d
good
flavor
and
all
but
when
i
reach
for
a
wheat
beer
i
crave
something
more
traditionally
german
or
belgian
this
is
an
interesting
and
quality
take
on
the
style
but
one
is
enough
for
me
not
a
tremendous
brew
but
not
half
bad
in
my
weizen
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
no
lacing
interesting
aroma
of
banana
citrus
and
spice
the
taste
was
mostly
banana
and
lemon
but
also
some
noticeable
clove
maybe
a
little
too
noticeable
still
a
refreshing
beer
drinkability
an
interesting
wheat
with
interesting
spices
and
flavors
definitely
mild
and
easy
to
drink
like
most
wheats
but
with
spices
not
in
most
one
to
try
at
least
once
a
hef
with
a
spiced
wit
like
twist
a
bit
of
a
orangeyellow
cloudy
with
an
intersting
sweet
lemon
coriander
and
ginger
nose
the
palate
carries
over
just
like
that
the
beer
has
a
mild
sweet
but
isnt
really
as
banana
like
most
hefs
but
a
wheat
lemon
citrus
sweet
tea
but
a
warm
quality
to
it
wonderful
contrast
to
the
beer
and
neutralizes
the
excessive
sweet
possibilities
citrus
not
of
spice
with
orange
peels
but
properly
hopped
not
a
heat
but
a
dry
beer
that
isnt
necessarily
astringent
the
taste
does
not
match
the
smell
profile
but
in
an
interesting
way
the
is
a
very
dry
beer
which
lends
itself
to
some
bitterness
it
is
soft
on
the
tongue
without
being
too
thick
or
oily
the
spices
are
nearly
nonapparent
shortlived
aftertaste
but
it
is
nicely
balanced
taste
is
wheat
tangy
at
first
lemon
slight
bitter
a
little
spice
hops
in
the
back
and
a
little
pine
ends
a
little
dry
ontap
at
sawmill
taproom
served
in
a
standard
pintglass
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
diminishing
head
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
aroma
is
mild
sweet
malt
and
just
a
trace
of
spice
the
beer
is
sweet
malts
and
slight
bubblegum
the
beer
is
light
and
crisp
but
lacking
the
carbonation
i
expect
in
a
wheat
beer
this
one
isnt
all
that
great
from
the
bottle
and
even
worse
ontap
mouthfeel
is
crispy
and
clean
good
drinkability
for
this
witbier
d
this
is
a
very
nice
quaffable
beer
that
would
make
a
great
session
overall
it
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
this
one
gets
the
flag
where
did
the
ginger
go
orange
zest
banana
coriander
wait
plenty
of
that
i
think
maybe
an
older
bottle
whatever
it
is
no
mas
i
have
much
better
beer
in
my
fridge
to
drink
so
although
it
isnt
that
bad
my
drain
will
have
the
bulk
of
this
bomber
medium
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
smooth
drinker
crisp
and
refreshing
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
nice
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
several
better
mild
wheat
beers
that
i
would
pick
first
have
to
admit
im
a
wee
bit
suspicious
of
the
30
ibu
rating
on
the
hop
that
is
listed
on
the
label
tasted
a
lot
hoppier
than
the
hazelnut
brown
the
same
level
of
hop
still
a
worthwhile
attempt
at
witbier
with
a
west
coast
twist
thrown
in
also
if
you
like
a
lighter
wheat
beer
as
well
its
close
to
it
d
decent
but
bland
beer
as
an
american
wheat
as
a
wit
i
would
rate
this
very
low
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
beer
also
im
curious
as
to
why
beeradvocate
still
calls
this
beer
halfeweizen
and
aliases
mom
hefeweizenwhich
is
what
rogues
website
refers
to
it
as
and
my
bottle
does
as
well
i
got
very
little
ginger
and
coriander
flavors
though
if
those
flavors
were
more
pronounced
and
a
belgian
yeast
was
used
rather
than
a
clean
fermenting
yeast
like
pacman
i
think
this
could
be
a
great
beer
just
finished
a
22
0z
the
color
was
good
but
did
not
really
taste
like
a
true
hefeweizen
i
did
not
detect
any
real
banana
or
similar
tastes
nothing
mspecvtacular
about
htis
but
then
again
nothing
bad
either
all
in
al
a
middel
of
the
road
for
me
i
have
had
much
better
hefes
thin
and
watery
but
finishes
very
clean
and
slightly
bitter
a
real
easy
drinker
i
purchased
a
case
of
these
for
15
and
i
think
i
got
a
great
bargain
i
would
probably
go
somewhere
else
for
a
real
and
better
wit
but
this
wasnt
bad
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
this
but
worth
a
try
ive
got
the
mom
hefeweizen
poured
out
crystal
clear
looks
like
a
pbr
in
a
glass
is
this
really
a
hefe
cant
they
just
call
it
a
wheat
ale
it
smells
like
ginger
and
hops
taste
just
the
same
with
a
little
much
ginger
and
too
many
hops
for
the
style
but
thats
typical
of
rouge
its
alright
its
just
not
a
hefeweizen
pours
bright
gold
with
a
2
cm
tall
white
head
can
really
smell
the
ginger
along
with
the
pleasant
wheat
grain
and
citrus
taste
is
like
an
american
wheat
wtih
spicy
belgianlike
flavors
orange
peel
coriander
and
the
saaz
are
a
great
mix
the
ginger
again
was
a
bit
powerful
but
still
nice
poured
a
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
1
12
finger
white
head
smelled
a
little
like
lemons
to
me
very
clean
smell
tasted
wheaty
but
very
good
this
is
an
amazing
hefe
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
good
medium
body
great
session
beer
a
really
well
done
hefe
compared
to
some
others
which
are
not
so
mainstream
the
only
downfall
is
the
american
hops
you
crazy
usaers
love
so
much
just
dont
seem
to
work
in
it
at
all
d
this
is
a
good
wit
not
my
favourite
in
the
world
but
an
easy
drinking
bomber
a
bit
expensive
for
what
you
get
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
could
probably
go
through
a
couple
bombers
in
a
session
this
wit
or
hefe
is
soso
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
in
the
flavour
dept
either
way
the
saaz
hops
are
pretty
potent
for
a
wheat
beer
however
drinkability
is
uh
eh
not
into
spice
heavy
beers
and
even
less
so
beers
that
market
themselves
as
a
beer
style
that
is
dependent
on
a
yeast
that
wasnt
used
this
is
neither
a
witbier
or
a
hefe
its
just
an
apwa
using
their
boring
ass
house
ale
yeast
as
usual
so
the
character
is
all
spices
and
not
even
really
the
wheat
nevertheless
its
not
terrible
by
any
means
the
wateriness
makes
it
pretty
easy
to
suck
down
its
just
not
something
worth
seeking
out
overall
a
meh
beer
not
terrible
but
not
great
either
the
flavor
confirms
my
american
yeast
suspicions
light
fruity
flavors
strong
hop
contributions
though
little
spice
overall
this
beer
would
score
big
with
a
bunch
less
ginger
d
this
beer
is
just
ok
i
probably
wouldnt
make
it
a
point
to
buy
it
again
its
not
bad
by
any
means
its
just
ok
this
beer
is
horrible
pours
a
very
murky
peach
color
with
a
head
that
evaporates
right
away
aroma
is
of
slight
orange
and
ginger
but
more
clean
than
anything
else
very
soda
or
seltzerlike
carbonation
and
sort
of
tastes
like
it
too
theres
some
coriander
and
some
weird
spice
which
i
guess
is
the
ginger
or
maybe
thats
the
saaz
hops
but
more
than
anything
else
it
is
bland
carbonated
like
hell
and
tastes
like
a
orange
juice
that
has
been
sitting
on
the
counter
for
a
couple
weeks
heres
a
case
where
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
buy
a
22
oz
bomber
to
sample
a
beer
a
small
tasting
would
have
been
just
fine
this
doesnt
strike
me
as
much
of
a
witbier
at
all
as
it
isnt
nearly
as
citrusy
as
the
wits
im
familiar
with
and
it
doesnt
have
the
same
bananaclove
characteristics
common
to
most
hefeweizens
the
best
comparison
i
can
offer
up
is
to
flensburgers
weizen
which
is
one
of
the
more
unique
weizenbiers
ive
ever
enjoyed
i
could
probably
take
a
few
more
of
the
moms
but
id
probably
go
with
something
else
if
i
had
the
choice
this
was
1
79
in
the
store
im
not
sure
if
this
was
a
mistake
but
i
had
the
guy
check
and
he
said
it
was
so
i
bought
three
great
value
hold
the
lemmon
wedge
please
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
it
goes
down
smooth
but
with
all
the
other
rogue
beers
out
there
to
sample
i
probably
wont
be
coming
back
to
this
one
great
feel
and
drinkability
drinkability
not
the
most
traditional
example
of
the
style
but
you
shouldve
known
that
going
into
this
ultimately
its
just
a
light
easydrinking
spiced
wheat
brew
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
very
pillowy
head
definite
spice
aroma
ginger
right
upfront
with
some
citrus
notes
and
a
dry
hay
kind
of
smell
the
taste
is
kind
of
as
expected
citrus
notes
and
ginger
dominate
the
profile
very
smooth
and
refreshing
initially
i
felt
this
was
kind
of
one
dimensional
but
after
a
couple
of
sips
the
beer
is
very
nice
indeed
something
id
definitly
go
back
to
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
faintsome
hops
and
wheat
the
taste
is
mainly
ginger
herbal
hops
some
toasty
malts
and
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
differentacidic
at
first
but
then
crisp
this
is
fairly
drinkable
but
not
as
refreshing
as
i
expected
it
to
be
22
oz
bomber
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
some
cloudiness
with
the
second
pour
though
the
beer
has
more
cloudiness
the
beer
pours
a
nice
almost
pillow
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lacing
on
top
of
the
beer
and
on
the
glass
the
coriander
spice
and
ginger
dominate
the
smell
with
a
faint
wheat
aroma
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
coriander
and
hops
with
a
faint
taste
of
ginger
the
feel
is
highly
carbonated
with
a
light
creaminess
to
it
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
session
beer
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
wit
highly
drinkable
and
easydrinking
drinkable
enough
not
a
great
representation
of
the
hefeweizen
style
id
probably
pass
this
one
up
in
favor
of
other
hefes
or
wits
there
are
better
of
both
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
wiht
a
white
head
that
recedes
to
lacing
quite
a
lot
of
effervecence
giving
off
a
nice
hefe
notes
of
citrus
and
spice
with
a
surprising
amount
of
hops
for
a
hafe
the
taste
was
a
little
less
spectacular
being
a
bit
blander
than
the
aroma
suggested
but
still
satisfying
with
the
citrus
and
spice
arangement
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
id
deffinitely
drink
a
few
more
of
these
the
beer
poured
golden
and
very
clear
with
a
fine
white
head
that
held
on
for
a
long
time
it
had
a
strong
aroma
of
those
cheap
yellow
butterscotch
candies
that
overpowered
almost
everything
else
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
the
butterscotch
carried
through
in
the
flavor
and
drove
in
to
a
bitter
finish
i
love
rogues
beer
but
this
is
not
their
best
effort
drinkability
another
interesting
beer
from
rogue
a
novelty
as
a
hefe
more
authentic
as
a
witbier
sort
of
a
belgian
white
ale
but
more
of
a
rogue
thing
going
on
here
a
very
herbed
ale
with
the
additions
of
ginger
and
coriander
the
saaz
hops
just
adds
to
the
complexities
this
one
really
surprised
me
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
a
soso
beer
but
it
impressed
me
a
bit
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
your
typical
witbier
but
more
of
a
wheatcoriander
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing

mom
deserves
more
than
this
i
still
dont
know
why
they
wrote

on
the
bottle
in
the
end
too
i
dont
know
unenjoyable
different
though
d
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
if
i
was
going
to
be
buying
a

but
it
isnt
too
bad
as
far
as
beer
goes
solid
beer
fairly
smooth
this
melds

with
a
fairly

one
of
my
favorites
from
rogue
drinkability
quite
drinkable
im
not
the
greatest
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
poured
a
bright
hazy
yellow
color
with
about
2
inches
of
bright
white
head
smell
is
somewhat
fruity
you
can
just
make
out
the
coriander
and
ginger
taste
is
very
nice
less
spicy
than
some
other
witbiers
a
nice
change
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
just
a
slight
bit
of
bite
on
the
back
end
very
drinkable
more
so
than
any
other
wit
i
can
remember
i
had
this
at
the
end
of
a
long
work
day
but
i
can
only
imagine
how
crisp
and
refreshing
it
would
be
after
a
hot
summer
day
outside
d
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
but
it
surely
wasnt
my
favorite
rogue
brew
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
leaves
a
nice
maltiness
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
nice
spiciness
that
covers
as
well
it
is
malty
all
the
way
through
with
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
of
the
drink
overall
this
would
be
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
in
the
summertime
as
34
bombers
would
cool
me
off
from
the
hot
sun
pours
a
nice
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
it
smells
of
yeast
and
citrus
fruits
with
hops
coming
out
as
well
the
taste
is
refreshing
slightly
sweet
very
tart
and
just
enough
bitterness
again
rogue
has
done
a
perfect
job
of
balancing
this
beers
characteristics
i
do
wish
that
this
beer
was
a
little
more
aggressive
but
nothing
was
done
wrong
just
a
little
conservative
in
my
opinion
overall
though
amazing
verdict
highly
drinkable
and
judging
by
the
name
sounds
like
a
cross
between
a
hefe
and
witbier
d
this
was
nice
i
expected
a
poor
flavourless
flat
brew
after
4
years
but
it
has
held
up
well
lots
of
nice
fruit
notes
in
the
taste
and
still
refreshing
650

from

saw
this
rogue

a
slightly
cloudy
and
hazy
appearance
with
a
minimal
frothy
head
that
soon
dissipated
smell
was
tinged
with
coriander
wheat
and
lemon
taste
was
dominated
by
pepper
citrus
and
florals

pepper
flavor
and
a
noticeable
wheat
and
coriander
essence
make
this
a
good
witbier
a
decent
selection
from
rogue
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
drinkability
especially
due
to
the
rather
modest

a
tasty
version
of
the
style
better
than
most
american
depictions
with
the
typical
rogue
quality
recommended
as
a
good
representation
of
the
sample
d
nothing
about
this
beer
makes
it
difficult
to
drink
but
it
isnt
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
that
inspires
me
to
keep
sipping
either
this
isnt
really
halfaweizen
it
is
more
like
notaweizen
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
wit
beer
either
it
really
lacks
any
redeeming
character
at
all
which
in
my
opinion
makes
it
a
stylistically
spoton
american
style
wheat
beer
slight
head
on
it
when
poured
and
it
went
away
quickly
pours
a
kind
of
cloudy
gold
color
the
initial
smell
and
taste
was
of
lemons
and
honey
i
found
this
to
be
a
decent
casual
drinking
beer
its
better
than
the
mega
breweries
for
sure
but
nothing
special
there
are
better
weizens
out
there
drank
half
a
bomber
that
i
bought
from
the
portland
brewpub
witbiers
and
hefeweizens
are
a
hard
sell
for
me
usually
and
to
be
honest
this
one
doesnt
help
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
billowy
white
head
that
condenses
into
a
thin
rim
of
white
lace
lots
of
carbonation
i
stuck
my
nose
into
this
and
smelled
carrots
there
are
some
of
the
standard
witbier
spices
orange
peel
coriander
etc
but
theyre
dominated
by
carrots
same
with
the
taste
some
spices
bit
of
wheat
but
mostly
this
taste
of
carrots
light
to
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
overall
its
drinkable
but
im
just
not
liking
the
aroma
and
flavors
too
onesided
perhaps
this
one
went
bad
traveling
home
from
portland
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
will
have
again
i
like
this
take
on
the
german
hefeits

and
they
did
a
hell
of
a

purchased
a
case
of
12
recently
for
cheap
at
the
brewpub
in
the
pearl
served
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
lime
slice
squeezed
over
it
i
recall
liking
it
being
served
this
way
from
the
last
time
i
had
it
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
first
impressions
were
a
very
euroesque
artisan
beer
smell
somewhat
like
old
cheese
i
mean
this
in
a
good
way
the
taste
was
that
of
somewhat
bitter
citrus
with
more
of
this
old
cheese
europils
type
flavor
very
light
mouthfeel
can
easily
down
a
few
bombers
in
a
sitting
especially
at
the
relatively
low
abv
the
second
glass
from
my
22oz
was
without
lime
and
was
more
pleasant
whether
this
was
due
to
the
lack
of
lime
the
unfiltered
yeast
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
or
the
fact
that
i
had
loosened
up
over
the
first
12
oz
i
wont
know
until
next
time
however
second
half
of
the
bottle
was
lacking
much
of
the
bitterness
of
the
first
not
a
great
beer
but
many
hefes
are
fairly
onesided
to
begin
with
summer
wheat
beers
that
are
light
and
good
with
pizza
for
the
genre
rogues
brew
may
be
one
of
the
better
ones
however
i
will
most
likely
be
giving
many
of
my
22oz
bottles
away
very
unique
not
a
personal
favorite
but
interesting
enough
di
wouldnt
typically
buy
a
beer
with
an
old
woman
in
a
tracksuit
on
the
front
but
i
was
very
surprised
the
flavor
is
light
but
has
some
nice
subtle
depth
the
fresh
malt
flavors
really
balance
the
soft
green
bitterness
i
dont
find
many
wheat
beers
that
i
would
consider
session
beers
but
this
is
definitely
one
of
them
d
this
one
is
decent
and
i
will
probably
have
it
again
not
my
favorite
wheat
beer
but
pretty
well
done
i
wish
others
could
match
the
superb
mouthfeel
of
this
one
had
this
one
from
a
22
oz
bomber
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
very
big
foamy
white
head
aroma
was
a
bit
pungent
mouthfeel
was
good
and
beer
was
very
smooth
flavor
wasnt
quite
what
i
expected
the
saaz
hops
were
evident
but
the
taste
wasnt
as
citrusy
as
i
expected
not
bad
but
ive
had
better
wheats
drinkability
fantastic
its
light
and
very
smooth
lots
of
big
ginger
spicyness
not
too
much
imo
that
i
really
enjoy
with
the
body
of
the
beer
great
beer
that
i
wish
i
didnt
have
to
drive
550
miles
for
highly
unoffensive
and
drinkable
though
id
probably
pull
a
different
wheat
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
long
overall
i
had
steered
clear
from
rogue
due
to
my
general
ambivalence
to
rogue
but
with
this
attempt
ill
try
them
some
more
overall
a
a
crisp
tasty
wheat
for
summertime
and
one
that
inspires
me
to
homebrew
an
example
of
my
own
overall
an
elusive
brew
that
has
finally
made
its
way
to
pa
ive
been
lookling
for
this
one
lately
its
been
hit
or
miss
for
me
with
rogue
but
this
one
is
a
definate
hit
not
the
strongest
american
hefe
out
there
but
a
solid
interpretation
blurs
the
lines
of
a
hefe
and
an
american
wheat
but
the
flavors
move
to
the
former
more
often
variation
on
the
style
tasty
this
definitely
should
not
be
classified
as
a
witbier
id
say
its
more
of
an
american
wheat
its
still
not
bad
at
all
though
id
prefer
this
one
over
many
other
rogue
beers
if
you
happen
to
see
it
anywhere
consider
yourself
lucky
and
grab
one

will
thank
you

is
pasty
and
sticks
around
pretty
good
to
the
end
there
is
a
moderate
amount
of
hop
aroma
and
nearly
dominated
by
floral
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
hint
of
orangish
aromas
too
this
actually
tastes
a
lot
like
pale
ale
not
like
a
wheat
beer
feels
wet
at
first
nut
finishes
dry
overall
very
refreshing
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
goldenstraw
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
quite
cereal
like
the
taste
is
of
grains
and
slightly
sour

the
taste
is
a
mild
and
refreshing
this
is
full
bodied
but
not
thick
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
high
as
it
can
go
down
quite
quickly
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
nice
crisp
feel
good
balance
of
flavors
quite
drinkable
i
will
probably
revisit
it
again
and
this
time
i
probably
wont
wait
another
3
or
so
years

d
very

that
would
compliment
a
warm
weather
day
nicely
i
would
seek
this
out
again
and
hefes
are
not
my
favorite
beers
this
is
a
nice
take
on
the
wheat
beer
model
for
me
anyway
given
that
im
not
usually
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
id
say
the
highly
attenuative
pacman
yeast
causes
mouthfeel
to
take
a
hit
and
id
like
to
see
better
head
retention
but
anyway
i
shared
this
bottle
with
my
girlfriend
and
she
didnt
complain
about
it
so
thats
a
victory
also
if
youre
sharing
a
22
oz
with
a
friend
take
the
latter
half
the
flavor
is
all
settled
on
the
bottom

without
the
usual
cloudyness
you
get
in
a
hefe
beer
one
finger
width

that
settles
to
a
film
the
smell
is
like
that
of
an
american
hefe
lacking
the
esters
and
clove
smells
but
with
a
hint
of
ginger
taste
is

hefe

ginger
and

is

sure
if
i
would
call
this
a
witbier
its
totally
different
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
huge
white
foamy
head
and
lots
of
lacing
afterwards
scents
of
hops
malts
yeast
and
some
slight
spices
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
slightly
malty
nice
little
bite
in
the
finish
medium
body
very
drinkable
would
make
a
good
summer
brew
session
i
liked
it
interesting
flavors
kept
coming
so
what
is
this
american
german
belgian
whatever
it
is
its
a
decent
beer
to
quaff
on
a
hot
summers
day
you
can
definitely
taste
the
american
west
coast
influence
on
this
beer
a
bit
hopped
up
for
a
witbier
not
much
of
a
head
but
smelled
pleasant
some
citrus
floral
hops
and
sweet
sugar
taste
of
sweet
malt
citrus
and
a
touch
of
ginger
overall
a
very
strange
but
refreshing
and
pleasant
beer
quaff
was
basically
the
same
i
could
taste
the
ginger
barely
its
full
bodied
good
carbonation

just
a
basic
wheat
beer
in
a
bomber
bottle
i
would
certainly
drink
these
but
id
rather
spend
my
6
on
a
sixer
of
good
wheat
brew
versus
one
bottle
of
half
e
supposedly
only
30
ibus
but
it
tastes
like
more
im
not
sure
what
it
is
but
american
brewers
just
cant
seem
to
do
this
style
correctly
this
is
a
ton
of
gumball
and
then
just
bitter
with
not
much
else
german
hefes
and
belgian
wittes
put
this
and
almost
all
other
american
interpretations
to
shame
i
think
from
now
on
ill
stick
to
the
traditional
where
this
style
is
concerned
not
a
great
example
of
a
wit
but
still
a
pretty
nice
beer
that
works
well
in
hot
weather
overall
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
rogue
though
still
better
than
virtually
any
macro
out
there
id
prefer
a
widmer
hefe
to
this
take
on
the
style
not
sure
what
they
were
shooting
for
here
but
it
looks
as
though
they
missed
not
recommended
cloudy
yellow
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
definately
emphasizes
the
use
of
ginger
and
coriander
along
with
spicy
hops
fruits
and
a
touch
of
raw
wheat
again
the
spicing
is
very
evident
ginger
and
coriander
in
flavor
but
in
the
end
this
was
very
light
bodied
and
very
average
but
better
than
typical
american
wheat
ales
not
the
type
of
wheat
beer
i
am
used
to
definetely
weizen
characteristics
sort
fluffy
banna
like
taste
buy
very
dry
this
is
a
crisp
tasting
beer
great
for
warm
weather
its
fairly
clear
for
a
unfiltered
without
much
foam
its
ok
though
because
it
does
not
try
to
be
a
german
sort
of
its
own
brew
sort
of
bewteen
a
weissbeer
and
a
pale
ale
with
more
on
the
weisbeer
side
a
very
nice
beer
overall
a
nicely
brewed
beer
with
some
great
attributes
but
its
not
what
ill
reach
for
when
i
want
a
witbier
a
darkerthanusual
rust
color
with
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
sweet
malts
caramelly
and
bready
merge
with
a
citrus
spiciness
for
a
rich
aroma
with
earthiness
and
a
light
muskiness
tastes
a
little
too
tilted
to
the
barley
malty
sweet
end
not
allowing
the
wheat
or
the
finess
of
the
wit
body
and
flavor
to
shine
the
corriander
ginger
and
citrus
flavor
balances
the
sweetness
nicely
if
not
boldly
the
body
is
medium
and
firm
a
little
heavier
than
i
want
in
a
wit
finishes
sweet
and
spicy
less
clean
or
crisp
as
what
i
would
have
liked
but
good
beer
nevertheless
just
not
for
a
wit
pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
medium
yellow
with
a
fairly
large
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
in
a
reasonable
period
of
time
and
leaves
no
lacing
smells
hoppy
with
a
noticable
malt
presence
and
some
spiciness
and
citrus
as
well
taste
is
hops
up
front
floral
and
sharp
with
a
noticable
spiciness
including
an
unusual
but
pleasant
ginger
note
which
gets
stronger
as
the
beer
warms
citrus
and
other
spices
are
present
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
fresh
making
it
a
very
nice
choice
on
a
pleasant
spring
day
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
ginger
in
most
applications
but
this
really
makes
it
work
and
creates
a
unique
and
enjoyable
beer
overallcheck
it
out
its
alright
nothing
to
write
home
about
im
faithful
to
rogue
for
their
not
so
typical
opinion
of
style
they
always
put
together
a
unique
opinion
on
tradtional
flavors
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
i
like
it
pours
a
lovely
and
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
2
head
with
little
lacing
am
a
little
disappointed
with
the
aroma
with
just
a
little
wheat
and
straw
and
the
littlest
hint
of
orange
taste
is
pretty
good
with
a
little
carbonation
at
the
end
finishing
with
a
tingle
on
the
tongue
im
finding
a
nice
blend
of
corriander
with
orange
and
a
little
wheat
a
good
hoppy
preseanse
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
one
i
could
drink
a
whole
lot
of
the
flavor
is
more
like
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
with
spices
the
hops
are
too
prevalent
for
me
to
think
of
it
as
a
witbier
i
taste
ginger
and
some
other
spices
that
i
just
cant
put
my
finger
on
the
label
notes
coriander
crisp
bitter
hops
are
evident
though
do
not
dominate
the
flavor
a
very
interesting
brew
which
in
my
opinion
bridges
the
style
gap
and
defies
finite
classification
a
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
slight
have
has
a
big
foamy
white
head
when
you
open
the
bottle
there
is
a
burst
of
spicey
clove
aroma
clove
and
corriander
are
the
two
main
notes
in
the
aroma
with
a
bit
of
sweet
orange
peel
in
the
background
the
clove
and
corriander
show
continues
in
the
taste
with
again
just
a
hint
of
orange
peel
in
the
background
there
is
a
nice
prickly
hop
bite
on
the
finish
the
smell
was
of
muted
spices
even
as
it
warmed
the
taste
starts
with
wheat
and
pale
malt
then
spices
then
finishes
creamy
esters
are
notably
absent
the
cream
effect
sticks
with
the
mouthfeel
and
makes
this
beer
unique
and
interesting
poured
to
a
dark
orange
with
minimal
head
with
little
lacing
smell
resembles
boiled
vegetables
with
hints
of
citrus
taste
is
slightly
bitter
with
citrus
undertones
and
a
spicy
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
gentle
unoffensive
not
overly
bitter
or
overly
carbonated
decent
and
drinkable
but
does
not
resemble
a
witbier
of
a
hefeweizen
at
all
reminds
me
more
of
a
saison
than
anything
else
really
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
definitely
unique
this
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
decent
headbut
it
does
disappear
a
little
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
the
smell
is
a
full
citrus
aroma
and
you
can
smell
some
floral
and
hop
scents
the
taste
has
a
real
citrus
and
hop
flavorbut
not
a
real
wheat
taste
it
does
taste
pretty
goodbut
the
mf
is
light
and
unbalanced
the
flavors
dont
mix
that
well
and
the
begining
of
a
sip
tastes
alot
different
from
the
aftertaste
this
may
work
in
some
beersbut
not
this
one
thisall
in
all
is
not
a
bad
brewit
is
very
refreshing
and
i
can
see
myself
having
this
in
the
summer
i
give
rogue
respect
for
their
nice
use
of
ginger
here
well
balanced
and
flavorful
drinkability
is
not
for
me
smells
nice
but
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
cloudy
gold
color
which
is
fine
but
even
with
a
good
pour
i
didnt
get
much
head
out
of
it
aroma
has
a
strong
maltiness
and
a
hint
of
hops
and
not
much
else
reminds
more
more
of
some
of
the
hoppier
american
wheats
not
a
witbier
the
flavor
too
is
more
paleale
like
with
a
good
solid
malty
base
good
hop
flavor
and
a
complimentary
bitterness
at
the
end
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
not
terribly
complex
but
firm
with
its
flavors
the
spices
claimed
on
the
bottle
are
not
very
evident
but
maybe
they
are
playing
into
the
perception
of
hop
flavor
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
at
all
i
think
the
phrase
half
a
weizen
means
a
lot
this
is
kind
of
part
pale
ale
part
witbier
part
weizen
and
100
original
rogue
i
think
if
you
want
a
witbier
dont
get
this
if
you
want
a
weizen
dont
get
it
but
if
you
just
want
a
good
beer
its
a
valid
choice
dry
hop
taste
followed
by
wonderful
yeast
ending
with
a
hint
of
pepper
hop
nice
balance
and
once
again
the
yeast
takes
center
stage
the
body
is
light
with
a
strong
carbonation
if
this
is
then
end
i
guess
i
have
to
say
the
glass
is
fully
empty
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
if
anything
it
would
benefit
from
slightly
less
ginger
that
being
said
the
ginger
was
very
natural
tasting
and
never
overpowering
impressive
their
is
one
lcbo
in
peterborough
i
like
but
its
a
tease
i
go
in
see
a
brewery
i
recognise
but
not
recognise
the
beer
rogue
happens
to
be
one
of
those
breweries
so
knowing
i
wont
be
able
to
get
this
at
home
i
picked
it
up
glad
i
did
the
pour
is
a
nice
hazey
orange
oddly
next
to
no
head
why
is
that
the
glass
is
clean
yet
very
little
foam
on
top
smells
hmm
nice
malts
coriander
citrus
wheat
and
ginger
taste
is
very
well
balanced
primarily
sweet
but
their
is
a
spiciness
and
hop
bitterness
that
coincides
with
it
not
much
coriander
just
enough
to
taste
reminds
me
a
bit
of
canada
dry
must
be
the
ginger
mouthfeel
is
hard
to
describe
smooth
and
fizzy
is
the
best
i
can
come
up
with
drinkable
oh
yeah
if
i
can
find
it
more
its
becoming
a
regular
session
beer
excellent
brewsky
from
the
good
old
brewers
named
rogue
this
beer
is
just
dynamite
all
the
way
from
the
grandma
on
the
cover
to
the
last
sip
of
the
pint
this
beer
rocks
appearance
is
cloudy
taste
is
very
hefe
style
goes
down
smooth
drinkability
is
very
high
crisp
in
the
mouth
with
strong
carbonation
and
a
mediumlight
body
overall
not
that
impressive
but
stll
makes
for
some
decent
drinking
well
suited
for
hot
summer
weather
drinkability
doesnt
taste
anything
like
a
hefe
to
me
maybe
the
lines
are
a
bit
dirty
on
this
one
will
have
to
try
it
again
down
the
line
nice
summer
quencher
with
flavor
definitely
more
of
a
whit
this
ia
a
nice
brew
but
for
the
4
25
price
of
a
pint
id
rather
buy
a
sixer
of
blue
moon
or
something
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
pretty
wild
malt
scent
it
has
a
wheat
feel
but
it
also
has
a
malty
edge
along
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
good
as
well
i
cant
figure
this
beer
out
it
goes
down
dry
and
spicey
with
the
coriander
and
ginger
but
it
finishes
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
malty
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
i
wish
the
co2
was
a
little
less
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
its
unique
in
its
approach
so
i
give
it
the
thumbs
up
it
is
complex
and
tastey
a
good
drinker

good

no

for
the

then
in
the
finish
the
wheat
and
saaz
hops
give
a
spicy

very
nicely
put
together
like
a
cross
between
a
wit
a
saison
and
a
dry
hefeweizen
chilled
to
about
40deg
this
is
a
great
spicy
dry
summer
ale
i
waited
in
long
anticipation
for
this
one
and
it
did
not
disappoint

one
that
id
definitely
have
again

is

nicely
hopped
some

pretty
malty

the

and
are

pleasant
very
smooth

22oz

smell
consisted
of
strong
spices
coriander

ginger
with
some
underlying

which
went
well
together
taste
was
great

good

starts
out
with
some

riding
along
with
it

and
sweetness
comes
in

a
little
on
the
dry
side
mouthfeel
seemed
medium
to
almost
full
chewy
texture
even
though
its
only
4

a
nice
wit
beer
but
allagashs
verison
is
a
little
better
than
this
one
but
thats
no
reason
not
to
pick
this
up
again
pours
a
fairly
clear
pale
gold
bog
white
head
the
nose
is
simply
with
hints
of
bread
yeast
little
bit
floral
taste
had
a
nice
wheat
character
with
prominent
hoppiness
to
back
it
up
slightly
crisp
but
also
with
a
creamy
texture
light
to
medium
body
offers
up
some
nice
thirst
quenching
qualities
but
is
still
complex
enough
to
be
morethan
a
hot
weather
beer
good
stuff
maybe
i
had
too
high
of
expectation
for
this
one
because
all
of
their
other
beers
are
so
good
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
most
hefeweizens
ive
had
have
been
fairly
quaffable
but
this
one
has
got
to
be
right
near
the
top
of
this
list
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
definitely
worth
trying
dark
gold
in
colour
with
a
bit
of
yeast
haze
aromas
of
munich
malts
ginger
spicy
hops
and
a
bit
of
grapefruit
not
much
wheaty
flavor
mainly
the
typical
munichy
rogue
malt
flavor
lots
of
ginger
flavor
there
too
with
a
hint
of
coriander
surprisingly
bitter
for
the
style
an
interesting
take
on
the
wheat
beer
thing
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
head
that
leaves
spiderweb
like
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
mostly
of
ginger
with
a
slight
clove
smell
in
the
background
the
taste
starts
with
the
ginger
followed
by
a
spicy
mix
of
clove
corriander
and
lemon
zest
with
a
creamy
finish
high
carbonation
and
a
creamy
mouthfell
make
this
witbier
hard
to
beat
really
a
fantastic
and
unique
witbier
kudos
to
rogue
for
such
an
unforgettable
treat
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
an
odd
mixture
of
spices
i
honestly
dont
care
for
the
aroma
some
ginger
in
there
with
something
else
that
i
cant
place
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
in
that
there
are
several
undesirable
flavors
that
i
cant
place
and
that
i
dont
like
it
has
a
really
musty
thing
going
on
with
a
citrus
kick
didnt
enjoy
it
much
thanks
to
clvand0
for
sharing
this
with
me
it
pours
a
dirty
tanbroan
color
with
a
finger
of
head
that
falls
to
coat
the
brew
the
nose
is
odd
it
has
some
slight
spiceyness
a
bit
of
grape
skin
and
a
slight
mustyness
hmm
the
flavor
is
somewhat
like
cereal
with
a
lot
of
graineyness
and
an
astringent
finish
not
my
favorite
here
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
there
is
a
lingereing
flavor
i
dont
like
that
really
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
pours
a
nice
cloudy
orangeyellow
color
and
has
a
huge
white
head
the
aroma
is
mostly
coriander
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
really
nice
it
reminds
me
of
bbcs
white
ale
spicy
fruity
refreshing
as
a
beer
can
get
but
the
plentiful
use
of
the
saaz
hops
really
sets
it
apart
from
other
witbiers
i
have
consumed
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
and
go
broke
in
the
process
medium
bodied
very
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
poured
a
medium
gold
with
very
little
head
or
lace
aromas
of
a
rich
malt
with
some
fruit
and
hop
smells
taste
is
quite
nice
a
rich
malt
with
some
orange
corriander
and
a
nice
hop
sharpness
sharp
but
not
bitter
leaves
a
lingering
biterness
on
the
sides
of
the
tounge
an
ok
beer
not
a
great
one
but
i
may
have
an
old
bottle
which
is
probably
the
case
i
first
bought
this
beer
thinking
it
was
a
german
weissebeer
but
it
is
really
a
witbier
a
good
one
but
definitely
has
a
rogue
twist
to
it
very
enjoyable
unimpressive
maybe
this
was
old
seemed
to
lack
life
and
boldness
esp
for
a
rogue
beer
a
palate
cleaner
of
bold
lemmony
orange
wheat
a
bomber
of
it
which
requires
a
drinking
buddy
or
two
too
citrussy
for
a
first
beer
in
a
session
hoppy
more
than
wheat
aroma
wheaty
beige
looks
coriander
vanilla
banana
easy
drink
if
you
are
in
the
moodm
but
not
for
everyone
as
always
rogue
succeeds
by
being
bold
and
hop
heavy
halfaweizen
may
not
be
a
classic
wit
but
its
a
damn
good
one
the
only
wheat
beer
my
fiancee
has
ever
liked
pours
an
appropriately
cloudy
amber
color
much
darker
than
expected
bright
lively
aromas
of
peach
wheatmalt
spices
and
grass
tastes
like
a
belgian
white
crossed
with
an
american
pale
ale
plenty
of
fruity
apricotpeach
flavors
meld
graciously
with
an
understated
malty
wheaty
taste
well
hopped
for
a
beer
of
this
style
a
very
good
introduction
to
wheat
beers
for
those
who
dont
like
them
a
clean
and
fresh
tasting
wheat
beer
that
balances
the
grainy
wheat
spices
and
pacman
yeast
to
good
and
balanced
effect
very
well
constructed
and
easily
drinkable
if
you
like
coriander
youll
like
this
beer
personally
its
never
been
my
cup
of
tea
so
i
had
to
treat
this
accordingly
especially
with
wits
like
st
bernardus
and
ommegang
witte
out
there
still
worth
a
try
and
id
probably
try
it
again
hazy
peachyhoney
gold
in
hue
the
liquid
is
very
attractive
in
color
there
was
a
basic
white
head
about
a
half
finger
in
height
on
the
pour
head
retention
was
lousy
as
it
rapidly
faded
to
a
soapy
cap
also
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
still
i
cant
hate
on
this
beer
because
i
really
dig
the
color
the
nose
is
very
citrusy
before
i
checked
the
bottle
to
look
at
the
ingredient
list
i
took
a
more
thoughtful
sniff
orange
peel
lemon
zest
both
are
very
soft
then
comes
a
dash
of
ginger
underneath
is
a
kiss
of
coriander
and
a
malty
smell
the
nose
is
like
a
juicy
wit
the
bouquet
is
not
musty
though
it
is
very
crisp
and
lively
this
seems
to
be
a
departure
from
a
proper
white
ale
as
expected
it
is
by
rogue
after
all
i
checked
the
bottle
i
would
have
figured
there
were
some
pacwc
hops
in
use
it
is
okay
to
be
wrong
the
potency
is
moderate
but
the
aromas
have
no
trouble
convincing
me
to
take
a
sip
i
do
with
glee
man
this
is
tasty
this
is
a
beautifully
constructed
beer
it
is
amazingly
playful
i
love
the
ginger
it
adds
some
complexity
and
a
modest
bite
the
coriander
is
second
fiddle
but
it
plays
its
role
it
the
scheme
of
things
there
are
some
definite
white
ale
qualities
even
though
there
are
only
minor
wheat
flavors
i
just
cant
get
past
the
soft
citrus
flavors
there
is
orange
peel
galore
with
just
a
suggestion
of
lemon
there
is
some
sweetness
too
kind
of
in
the
middle
but
more
towards
the
end
this
aspect
doesnt
linger
long
as
the
hops
curb
any
further
development
the
saaz
hops
end
the
taste
pleasant
spicy
qualities
i
found
this
very
refreshing
i
thought
soba
was
rogues
best
summer
quaffer
not
anymore
medium
in
body
the
carbonation
has
some
energy
and
this
helps
create
a
very
pleasant
mouthfeel
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
for
a
wheat
beer
of
sorts
it
really
brings
a
lot
of
different
flavors
to
the
table
in
many
ways
it
is
better
than
a
decent
hefeweizen
andor
a
wit
blasphemy
i
know
i
can
think
of
dozens
of
foods
to
pair
this
beer
with
i
wish
i
had
more
i
wish
i
could
get
more
easily
i
bought
my
bomber
in
burnsville
mn
for
4
39
it
is
tasty
stuff
and
worth
trying
draught
ctriver
brewers
festival
this
one
pours
a
dark
golden
color
there
was
some
head
to
it
the
nose
was
that
of
a
light
citrus
and
wheat
maybe
a
hint
of
spices
and
hops
in
there
also
the
taste
was
citrusy
wheat
with
some
yeastiness
this
was
a
solid
wheat
beer
taste
is
great
a
light
fizzy
mouthfeel
aides
the
lemon
mixes
with
the
ginger
mixs
with
a
light
malt
all
so
perfectly
it
is
not
neccesarily
different
but
it
is
in
so
many
way
very
refreshing
enjoy
it
if
you
find
it
an
odd
beer
not
exactly
a
wit
or
a
weizen
enjoyable
nonetheless
greenish
yellow
hue
with
lots
of
haze
to
the
point
of
creating
an
almost
neonlike
cast
to
the
whole
glass
thin
carbonation
flirting
around
the
top
and
throughout
the
draught
and
yet
nothing
to
get
worked
up
about
bubblegum
bouquet
notes
with
some
jumpy
clover
and
coriander
quite
understated
and
less
wheaty
than
many
hefes
and
thus
more
drinkable
for
the
likes
of
me
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
those
with
gluten
intolerance
might
be
able
to
bang
this
one
down
without
too
many
problems
still
there
were
some
straw
aspects
present
to
taste
as
well
as
lemonlime
hints
the
lack
of
a
banana
presence
was
refreshing
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
summer
brew
not
syrupy
like
others
in
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
at
all
special
im
not
really
sure
what
the
point
of
a
beer
like
this
is
the
best
part
of
a
heffe
is
the
flavors
generated
by
the
yeast
but
the
pacman
gives
you
none
of
the
typical
traits
saaz
hop
aroma
is
nice
and
wheat
flavor
still
shines
but
its
really
nothing
to
write
home
about
really
is
a
halfassweizen
end
result
of
handpump
is
a
very
slightly
hazed
golden
yellow
with
bronze
highlights
and
a
frothy
soapy
eggshell
white
head
dulled
gingery
notes
and
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
and
tropical
fruit
esters
also
kind
of
subdued
coriander
in
there
too
yet
faint
everythings
faint
i
love
caskconditioned
beers
but
this
ones
a
bust
i
had
it
freshly
tapped
and
it
tasted
a
bit
too
oxidized
and
metallic
sorry
guys
i
love
your
beers
but
this
ones
just
not
hittin
the
spot
this
beer
is
a
bit
watery
midpalate
not
entirely
bad
but
not
wholly
enjoyable
i
remembered
liking
this
more
out
of
the
bottle
poured
an
orange
yellow
small
head
that
left
some
lacing
smelled
citrusy
and
spicey
lemon
taste
with
herbal
flovour
too
much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
sweeter
than
i
expected
it
to
be
it
is
a
good
drink
but
i
think
rogue
is
much
better
in
the
stout
department
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
a
nice
american
version
of
the
style
a
solid
rogue
production
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
little
white
head
no
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
corriander
and
lemons
very
crisp
tasting
brew
with
nice
citrusy
hops
flavors
smooth
out
with
sweet
malty
finish
good
spices
throughout
the
brew
very
refreshing
and
smooth
very
creamy

mouthfeel
good
ammount
of

brew
that
you
could
relax
with
for
a

a
soft

lots
of

with

noticable

goodness
is
balanced
with
the
wonderful
ginger
flavor
light
but
flavorful
mouthfeel
slightly
short
on
the
finish
overall
a
tasty
summer
brew
then
ginger
adds
a
nice
change
from
your
average
ordinary
hefe
poured
into
an
imperial

flavor
is
lighter
than

from

but
the
slack
is
picked
up
by
the
ample
spicing
and
citrus
notes
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
both
excellent
with
the
crispness
making
it
a
great
summertime
quaff
an
interesting
turn
on
the
hefe
style
making
it
a
bit
less
chewy
a
bit
more
drinkable
nice
result
for
rogue
this
beer
was
refreshingly
unhoppy
the
slight
saaz
tones
blended
with
a
nice
wheatiness
spiced
by
the
ginger
i
could
easily
drink
myself
out
of
house
and
home
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
come
across
medium
bodied
and
sturdier
than
the
average
witbier
and
a
good
deal
better
too
swirl
and
final
pour
ah
theres
the
sediment
i
was
looking
for
the
glass
turns
from
clear
golden
to
cloudy
yellow
with
a
brownorange
tinge
ah
thats
betterthe
yeast
brings
more
backbone
to
the
beer
without
detracting
from
its
drinkability
very
goodand
i
wish
i
had
turned
the
bottle
upside
down
a
few
times
to
loosen
the
sediment
before
opening
it
the
foundation
is
basically
good
quality
nice
and
steady
and
the
ginger
is
an
interesting
additional
element
but
at
the
same
time
the
seasoning
takes
it
close
to
being
a
bit
of
a
novelty
its
something
you
want
to
tastem
but
in
my
case
having
done
so
i
wont
soon
have
another
sure
it
is
indeed
drinkable
if
ginger
is
your
thing
but
that
makes
it
a
niche
beer
no
its
not
bad
and
may
be
fundamentally
good
but
this
ones
enough
for
me
this
brew
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
large
white
foam
head
on
top
sheets
of
lace
are
left
behind
the
scent
is
a
nice
floral
scent
with
some
berry
elements
as
well
the
taste
has
wheat
beeries
floral
hops
citrus
elements
and
ginger
as
well
a
wonderfully
complex
beer
based
on
wheat
characteristics
delicious

brilliant

the

was

and
was
topped
by
thick
rough
and
sticky
white
head
the
nose
was
fairly
low
key
presenting
a
wheaty
huskiness
and
notes
of
coriander
and
light
orangey
citrus
on
the
palate
a
delicious
creamy

up
with

which
led
into

into

that
left

and

retained

made
for

a

this
beer
pairs
exceptionally
well
with
sushi
hazy
gold
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
of
fruit
and
spice
maybe
berries
and
citrus
taste
is
very
dry
compared
to
the
smell
the
corriander
and
ginger
flavors
mix
with
an
acidic
flavor
to
make
this
a
very
odd
beer
very
unique
however
i
dont
think
i
have
had
anything
like
this
before
overall
this
is
an
excellent
wheat
ale
the
ginger
is
used
to
absolute
perfection
and
the
coriander
and
maybe
orange
peel
add
a
lovely
dimension
to
what
is
still
a
highly
quaffable
refreshing

the

seems
like
something
that
could
be
on
the

soft

with
the

in
the
finish
it
contains
a

with
hints
of

not
a
true
hefeweizen
but
awesome
mix
of

this
is
where
this

emulates
a

the
most
has
a

fluffier
mouthfeel
with
spritzier

medium
to
light
in

drinkability
the

start
to

on

but
overall
an

gone
homebrewer
creation
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
with
a
decent
head
that
leaves
some
light
lacingtraces
of
ginger
in
the
aroma
with
whif
of
orange
zest
in
there
as
well
taste
doesnt
have
the
fruitiness
that
i
like
in
the
style
but
a
nice
spiciness
from
the
coriander
and
ginger
a
pretty
easy
drinking
brew
that
is
solid
but
i
wanted
a
little
more
quick
summary
a
good
brew
overall
but
i
was
really
hoping
it
would
be
something
to
write
home
about
given
rogues
recommendations
and
accolades
and
it
isnt
really
pours
a
mighty
fine
dirty
blonde
with
fair
head
retention
and
the
typical
cloudiness
of
a
hefe
smell
is
much
like
any
other
beer
and
not
that
distinguishable
taste
at
first
seems
to
be
of
a
typical
hefe
minus
feeling
much
particles
on
your
tongue
but
evolves
with
the
ginger
that
was
added
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
the
ginger
adds
to
the
brew
however
without
it
the
brew
would
taste
fairly
bland
with
it
the
beer
tastesunusual
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
can
see
why
some
people
are
attracted
to
it
give
it
a
spin
because
i
sure
as
heck
cant
tell
you
if
you
are
going
to
like
it
nice
big
belgianstyle
head
nice
weizen
coloration
and
a
wonderfully
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
a
pretty
straight
weizen
flavor
but
with
a
slight
extra
zing
from
the
ginger
which
adds
a
slight
tanginess
to
it
much
sweeter
than
ive
come
to
expect
from
rogue
bravo
guys
with
fresh
bombers
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
something
truly
unique
an
odd
beer
but
pleasantly
drinkable
poured
from
a
brown
22oz
bomber
with
a
nice
picture
of
somebodys
grandma
wearing
big
ol
eyeglasses
and
hoisting
a
foamy
mug
definitely
more
adventurous
than
my
own
grandma
and
an
excellent
beer
to
boot
the
halfeweizen
pours
into
the
glass
a
golden
honey
color
that
is
amazingly
clear
if
you
dont
agitate
it
and
topped
with
just
a
bit
of
frothy
white
head
plenty
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
halferoma
is
an
intriguing
blend
of
wheat
sweetness
and
spice
taste
is
similarly
outoftheordinary
bursting
with
character
and
spice
unlike
any
other
hefe
ive
tasted
starting
off
its
just
a
bit
hoppy
then
quite
spicy
with
flavors
of
orange
coriander
and
maybe
a
little
ginger
bite
coming
to
the
fore
then
a
more
classic
malty
wheat
flavor
comes
in
towards
the
middle
and
end
finishing
off
with
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
this
brew
is
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
and
unfortunately
quite
difficult
to
find
in
my
area
but
worth
keeping
an
eye
out
for
it
has
very
tingly
carbonation
with
a
light
fruity
flavor
it
is
lacking
a
bit
but
it
is
still
ok
the
balance
is
pretty
good
but
the
graininess
got
a
little
big
at
times
there
are
notes
of
bitterness
and
orange
peels
to
add
a
little
complexity
it
is
really
not
that
interesting
overall
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
my
least
favorite
rogue
so
far
pours
with
a
head
that
quickly
fades
tempting
amounts
of
unfiltered
yeast
settle
to
bottom
of
glass
as
with
other
wheattype
beers
rather
thin
mouthfeel
has
the
amberorange
color
of
a
german
wheat
but
thats
where
the
similarity
ends
initial
taste
is
that
reminding
me
of
an
amber
ale
but
the
aftertaste
is
unnecessarily
bitter
i
shouldnt
make
direct
comparisons
with
other
beers
by
name
but
this
tastes
likes
a
5050
mix
of
bells
amber
ale
and
rogues
bitter
ale
which
leaves
the
beer
in
a
strange
taste
category
rogue
has
an
outstanding
chocolate
stout
and
shakespeare
stout
but
this
ones
bitter
aftertaste
ruins
it
for
me
which
is
unfortunate
because
i
like
beers
with
intense
flavor
rogue
is
always
original
and
has
a
real
passion
for
beer
this
quality
always
shines
through
in
any
and
all
of
their
concoctions
combined
review
for
both
tap
and
bottle
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thing
but
still
not
bad
at
all
a
good
refreshing
brew
after
a
few
dissapointments
from
this
brewer
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
but
this
wasnt
half
bad
relatively
nice
cohesion
of
of
vanilla
citrus
clove
banana
and
hop
and
quite
refreshing
and
quaffable
i
really
was
expecting
worse
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
pours
to
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
in
the
aroma
i
get
an
immediate
blast
of
ginger
coriander
and
fruit
the
flavor
is
fruity
with
the
ginger
and
coriander
flavors
as
well
it
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
drying
finish
it
is
a
lightbodied
refreshing
brew
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
one
rogue
really
reminds
me
of
a
west
coast
magic
hat
they
pretty
much
brew
what
they
want
to
and
so
be
it
if
your
like
or
dislike
their
brews
halfeweizen
is
a
great
example
of
this
brewing
method
its
certainly
not
a
hefeweizen
so
what
the
hell
is
it
i
dont
know
but
its
pretty
damn
good
pours
a
light
amber
witha
medium
head
that
has
minimal
lasting
lace
there
is
an
immediate
sweet
smell
but
nothing
overpowering
quite
a
creamy
brew
with
a
noticeable
hoppiness
and
wheatiness
to
it
hints
of
ginger
and
spices
throughout
as
well
a
little
bit
of
this
and
that
but
a
whole
lotta
good
another
winner
from
rogue
this
brew
pours
a
medium
white
head
of
small
to
medium
sized
bubbles
and
a
golden
amber
body
with
carbonation
rising
in
the
mug
the
receding
head
leaves
behind
an
excellent
lacing
it
has
a
mild
fruityfloral
aroma
i
was
disappointed
with
the
taste
of
the
brew
though
i
was
expecting
something
like
a
hefeweizen
and
i
didnt
get
it
it
had
a
bitter
aftertaste
that
was
atypical
it
had
a
smooth
initial
taste
but
that
finished
kind
of
ruined
it
for
me
overall
impression
i
can
definitely
see
why
this
beer
has
developed
a
bit
of
a
following
despite
the
fact
that
it
falls
far
outside
the
rogue
ouevre
of
hop
bombs
pretty
tasty
would
definitely
buy
again
medium
yellow
color
nicely
hazy
but
not
really
cloudy
generates
a
generous
12
inch
head
of
large
bubbles
but
it
powers
down
in
25
seconds
or
so
slight
lace
in
a
pint
glass
dense
aromas
not
distinct
but
more
of
wet
hay
yeast
and
lemon
zest
almost
like
wet
canvas
grainy
texture
flavors
of
hot
cinnamon
and
ginger
snap
sort
of
pop
like
little
explosions
nicely
hopped
peppery
finish
given
its
half
a
weizen
name
i
rate
this
beer
as
unique
almost
like
a
hoppedup
wit
or
something
interesting
and
a
variation
on
the
rolling
and
estery
hefes
that
get
a
little
boring
come
the
hot
weather
months
light
but
solid
cloud
of
hazy
pale
gold
straw
in
color
quite
gorgeous
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
within
head
is
white
loose
big
bubbly
froth
about
a
pencil
width
high
faded
fast
leaves
minimal
lace
smell
is
very
dull
but
solid
lemon
and
orange
with
a
light
wheat
backing
and
a
light
note
of
ginger
spice
taste
is
a
mellow
mirror
reflection
of
the
smell
with
flavors
of
orange
and
lemon
dulled
down
wheat
mellow
and
easy
with
a
light
full
balance
of
hops
and
notes
of
light
spice
of
ginger
and
cinnamon
full
body
feel
smooth
mellow
light
airy
drying
in
the
finish
showing
up
late
very
drinkable
and
easy
good
thing
it
comes
in
the
22oz
cuz
this
went
fast
yummy
stuff
definitely
not
a
hefeweizen
but
very
tastey
does
not
look
like
much
no
head
no
sediment
hazey
not
really
cloudy
smells
great
but
mostly
sour
not
sure
where
the
name
comes
from
but
with
every
quality
this
beer
moves
farther
and
farther
from
a
hefe
tastes
good
sour
clean
and
crisp
though
wheat
aftertaste
there
you
go
some
hints
of
ginger
as
well
very
drinkable
maybe
because
it
keeps
you
wondering
what
you
are
drinking
notes
certainly
not
my
favorite
rogue
beer
but
one
that
would
stand
up
to
a
hot
and
humid
virginia
summer
day
filled
with
cutting
grass
ive
got
to
give
it
up
to
rogue
another
unique
creation
this
beer
was
served
with
a
fair
white
head
and
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
texture
one
of
the
folks
at
my
table
said
it
looked
like
a
pretty
poor
urine
sample
the
beer
was
a
weak
sample
of
a
hefe
it
looked
sort
of
like
a
hefe
but
it
did
not
have
the
aroma
nor
the
taste
of
a
good
hefe
it
was
an
okay
beer
to
start
a
flight
of
beers
at
the
bar
i
would
neither
recommend
nor
slam
this
beer
if
someone
wanted
a
good
hefe
this
is
not
one
i
would
recommend
this
brew
poured
a
small
head
which
quickly
dissolved
this
beer
left
no
lacing
on
the
side
of
my
mug
this
beer
had
a
fruity
citrusy
aroma
to
it
this
beer
definitely
had
carbonation
to
it
it
had
a
bitter
taste
to
it
but
it
was
not
an
overwhelming
bitterness
there
was
a
mild
aftertaste
with
this
brew
but
it
was
one
that
did
not
linger
which
is
to
my
liking
this
is
a
brew
that
i
would
definitely
like
to
enjoy
again
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
with
this
concoction
as
a
lover
of
spiced
belgians
and
german
weizens
the
thought
of
the
combination
i
found
intriguing
so
i
tried
ginger
corriander
none
present
to
me
in
this
sampling
the
beer
was
drinkable
but
unimpressive
rogue
brews
some
of
the
best
in
this
country
but
this
one
needs
some
tweeking
overall
a
nice
hefe
pours
a
slightly
hazy
coppergold
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
is
yeasty
and
slightly
sweet
with
just
a
hint
of
phenols
flavor
begins
slightly
sweet
then
somewhat
citrusy
and
tart
with
a
sharp
spicy
bitterness
in
the
finish
moutfeel
is
somewhat
rough
with
a
medium
body
with
its
lack
of
phenols
and
hoppy
character
this
is
definitely
an
american
interpretation
of
a
hefeweizen
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
as
someone
who
really
loves
a
good
hefeweizen
i
was
somewhat
dissapointed
this
is
not
one
im
likely
to
seek
out
again
the
beer
pourschill
hazed
deep
amber
to
copper
color
the
head
preposterous
in
size
spumous
in
texture
brilliant
white
in
color
and
as
it
erodes
leaves
behind
a
covering
sheet
of
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
with
a
slight
yeast
tone
crisp
fresh
and
quite
pleasant
start
is
sweet
and
loaded
with
malt
the
top
middling
and
the
finish
spiteful
in
its
acidic
bite
the
hops
stinging
in
their
bite
dry
aftertaste
that
is
long
lasting
and
a
fine
quaffable
beer
the
taste
is
nearly
as
delicious
as
a
slight
fruitiness
precede
the
crisp
hop
kick
at
the
end
lemon
and
clove
are
also
easily
traceable
the
yeast
leaves
an
interesting
slightly
sticky
aftertaste
which
leaves
me
wantin
some
more
mouthfeel
is
slightly
spicy
this
is
definitely
one
i
could
drink
allllllll
night
long
another
winner
from
rogue
bottling
a
hefeweizen
in
bombers
perhaps
is
not
the
best
way
i
have
a
large
halfliter
paulaner
hefe
glass
and
i
cant
get
the
whole
bottle
in
especially
with
the
large
head
most
of
the
yeast
had
settled
and
stuck
to
the
bottom
so
my
first
sips
were
of
halfekristal
weizen
after
drinking
some
to
get
some
space
in
the
glass
and
some
bottle
swirling
it
turned
a
nice
cloudy
gold
yes
i
know
i
could
have
agitated
the
bottle
before
opening
but
i
have
trouble
with
geysers
when
i
do
that
the
aroma
is
nice
wheat
and
coriander
the
ginger
doesnt
come
through
as
much
in
either
the
aroma
or
flavor
the
belgian
wit
half
is
good
with
the
coriander
adding
a
nice
spiciness
especially
coupled
with
the
saaz
hops
theres
good
wheatiness
although
not
as
big
as
the
wheat
in
the
widmenr
hefeweizen
i
had
last
night
unfortunately
pacman
yeast
isnt
really
a
good
yeast
for
a
wheat
beer
the
lack
of
almost
any
esters
unbalances
this
beer
keeps
the
beer
from
achieving
the
complexity
wheat
beers
are
capable
of
and
makes
the
flavor
thinner
than
it
should
the
beer
doesnt
look
very
carbonated
and
has
a
dull
chill
hazed
golden
appearance
not
much
of
a
head
just
a
slight
rimming
of
tan
soapy
head
this
beer
smell
like
a
wit
wheat
and
corriander
dominate
the
nose
the
taste
is
enjoyable
ginger
is
so
subtle
and
complimentary
there
are
none
of
the
predominant
hefeweizen
characteristics
present
but
i
dont
think
a
hefeweizen
was
intended
with
this
beer
most
closely
resembles
a
wit
but
not
totally
body
is
lightmedium
mouthfeel
is
a
little
spritzy
some
lemon
notes
hit
the
palate
refeshing
solid
and
unique
brew
id
like
a
keg
of
this
next
summer
a
very
unique
weizen
peach
colored
with
a
minimal
head
very
spicypeppery
nose
with
a
bit
of
saaz
hops
quite
alot
of
different
flavors
going
on
some
wheat
characteristics
but
the
coriander
and
ginger
spiciness
definitely
dominates
very
crisp
and
refreshing
probably
not
my
favorite
wheat
but
an
interesting
herb
and
spice
beer
worth
a
try
rogue
makes
beer
fun
and
interesting
bavarian
to
me
this
has
belgian
written
all
over
it
an
extremely
drinkable
white
ale
nice
balance
on
the
coriander
which
is
there
as
a
very
lightly
fruity
aromatic
rather
than
an
inyourface
flavoring
adjunct
smooooth
well
done
again
rogue
gorgeous

a
touch

adds
to
the

taste
is
a
blend
of
the
elements
of
the
aroma
and
a
pleasant
fruity
character
created
presumably
by
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
a
perfect
medium
a
unique
example
of
a
hybrid
bavarian
hefe
and
a
belgian
wit
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
citrus
beer
serving
type

easily
in
my
top
5

beers
perfect

with
the

with

god
amount
of

smells
like
a
meadow
full
of
wheat

with
a
hint
of

taste
is
fantastic
and
goes
down

smooth
one
of
the
best
belgian

have
had
the
chance
to
down
one
of
shiners
better
brews
and
definitely
a
step
up
from
shock
top
and
blue
moon
the
coriander
is
not
overpowering
which
is
the
case
with
some
other
witbiers
in
my
opinion
overall
solid
witbier
a
better
than
average
belgian
white
nothing
fancy
but
a
step
up
from
your
every
day
belgian
whites
decent
wit
bier
but
a
little
thin
overall
the
most
disappointing
spoetzel
beer
i
have
tried
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
brewer
and
this
beer
just
did
meet
my
expectations
excellent
i
prefer
white
wing
over
blue
moon
for
a
refreshing
wheat
ale
overall
not
a
bad
take
on
a
belgian
white
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
slight
effervescent
bubbling
that
lasts
well
into
the
glass
producing
less
than
a
finger
of
rapidly
dissipating
frothy
variously
bubbled

the
aroma
appearance
and
taste
are
great
it
went
down
easy
and
was
flavored
uniquely
the
mouthfeel
falls
short
but
thats
not
a
huge
problem
for
me
the
main
difference
here
between
this
and
other
wits
is
that
its
got
a
peppery
feel
to
the
wheat
taste
and
the
musky
sharp
cheddar
dryness
id
drink
it
again
and
its
a
good
wit
if
youre
not
too
picky
id
like
another
actually
taste
meh
its
not
good
not
bad
a
light
wheat
beer
but
hit
me
with
some
coriander
at
the
end
i
would
drink
this
if
i
was
already
drunk
but
there
are
better
wheat
beers
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
excellent
strong
orange
peel
and
coriander
aroma
pretty
much
a
malty
taste
no
bitterness
from
hops
slightly
spicy
coriander
taste
at
the
end
okay
beer
somewhat
watered
down
would
drink
if
available
but
wouldnt
seek
out
and
would
probably
drink
something
else
if
there
was
a
good
beer
selection
it
beats
some
of
the
macro
belgian
whites
out
there
ahem
shock
top
ahem
but
then
again
that
doesnt
speak
that
highly
of
this
brew
honestly
i
would
drink
again
but
i
wouldnt
pick
it
up
anywhere
overall
very
light
if
any
witbier
flavors
make
this
a
very
lackluster
take
on
the
style
avoid
total
3350
taste
toasted
biscuit
spice
and
then
a
flush
of
bitterness
overall
nice
witbier
from
the
tx
boys
been
enjoying
the
sampler
pack
this
brew
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
its
mostly
clear
with
just
a
slight
haze
and
a
small
head
its
not
as
attractive
as
id
hoped
some
wheatlike
tartness
is
notable
in
the
smell
along
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
citrus
no
malt
and
no
real
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
spritzy
and
a
nice
spice
character
comes
out
on
the
sweet
side
moderate
to
light
in
body
its
a
recognizable
wit
but
not
much
beyond
average
poured
from
a
12

a

some

taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
lots
of
orange
lots
of
sweetness
no
hops
at
all
no
bitterness
for
most
of
the
drink
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
not
much
m
light
bodied
good
carbonation
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
o
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
although
theres
not
much
happening
with
it
i
would
not
pay
for
it
again
especially
at
8
bucks
a
sixer
however
if
it
was
offered
to
be
at
a
party
or
bbq
i
wouldnt
refuse
it
as
a
beer
goes
its
rather
boring
this
is
the
first
belgian
white
ive
ever
had
so
i
cant
rate
it
based
on
the
style
if
this
is
what
the
style
usually
is
then
i
probably
wont
be
a
witbier
drinker
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
hops
i
think
a
beer
needs
some
bitterness
to
make
it
a
beer
even
if
its
just
a
little
on
the
other
hand
as
an
allaround
cold
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
certainly
would
not
pass
it
up
i
give
this
beer
a
high
score
because
its
the
best
white
i
have
had
up
to
this
point
ive
tried
several
and
i
generally
think
there
is
a
poor
sour
aftertaste
for
this
style
of
beer
i
really
spoetzls
white
wing
because
it
has
a
clear
and
crisp
finish
i
utilized
an
agitating
pour
involving
continually
swirling
the
beer
in
the
bottle
as
it
was
being
decanted
into
a
glass
this
prevented
any
cascading
but
it
did
produce
two
rocky
fizzy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
limited
retention
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
lightyellow
srm
2
nose
smelled
more
like
lemon
zest
than
orange
peel
and
with
a
black
pepper
spiciness
oooh
it
is
already
a
hot
humid
day
so
i
am
hoping
for
something
refreshing
from
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
fizzy
with
loads
of
carbonation
the
taste
was
kind
of
light
for
the
style
but
i
definitely
tasted
the
orange
peel
at
this
point
the
finish
was
semidry
with
the
coriander
giving
it
a
black
pepper
bite
it
was
indeed
a
refreshing
beer
but
it
was
lacking
in
taste
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
creamy
medium
white
head
aromas
of
citrus
peel
and
coriander
the
flavors
begin
with
some
lemon
then
light
bread
and
finishes
with
some
spices
and
a
hint
of
bitterness
to
balance
mouthfeel
is
decent
overall
a
good
witbier
cheers
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
this
is
a
bright
gold
beer
with
a
nice
thick
fingers
worth
of
head
the
aroma
is
actually
pretty
good
for
the
stylelemony
very
fruity
a
touch
of
corianderand
the
coriander
comes
through
quite
clearly
when
drinking
its
thirstquenchingly
acidic
and
very
fruity
its
actually
not
that
bed
of
a
witbierheck
id
even
say
its
on
par
with
hoegarden2014
hoegarden
i
mean
not
1990s
hoegarden
before
it
got
dumbed
down
unusually
good
beer
from
shiner
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
much
i
drank
about
3
until
i
could
get
my
mind
on
it
tastes
like
orange
citrus
bathroom
cleaner
with
a
very
slight
beer
taste
bitter
bite
at
the
end
has
too
much
orange
taste
and
not
much
else
not
bad
the
appearance
was
a
thin
yellow
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
a
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
was
mostly
citrus
with
a
little
bit
of
wheat
the
taste
was
the
same
with
a
little
bit
of
mint
and
then
orange
peel
in
the
finish
very
comparable
to
blue
moon
was
not
overall
very
impressed
i
start
cussin
now
for
about
10
minutes
ok
much
better
now
o
overall
an
easy
drinking
wit
good
snap
and
crisp
carbonation
worthy
a
try
for
a
summer
time
quencher
of
a
light
affair
lean
body
with
a
mediumlight
carbonation
washes
down
with
little
difficulty
could
use
a
little
bit
of
heap
or
girth
otherwise
a
friendly
witte
the
beer
pours
a
nice
light
gold
thats
pretty
clear
not
a
lot
of
evidence
that
it
hasnt
been
filtered
the
aroma
is
a
full
wit
aroma
with
flowery
hops
melding
with
the
orange
and
coriander
the
taste
is
outstanding
covering
all
the
basics
for
a
wit
malt
hops
yeast
and
spices
blending
well
a
nice
light
feel
just
as
youd
expect
from
a
wit
i
thought
this
was
a
very
nice
effort
from
spoetzl
while
they
usually
give
a
nice
low
end
version
of
most
styles
a
subtle
style
like
a
wit
plays
right
into
their
sweet
spot
one
of
their
best
offerings
i
will
be
drinking
more
presentation
packaged
in
a

brew
that
would
go
down
nicely
on
a
warm
day
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
spice
yeast
and
citrus
fruit
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
flavors
are
a
bit
watery
in
my
opinion
white
wing
might
be
overly
simplistic
in
taste
and
body
but
the
overwhelming
perfume
of
orange
peels
and
coriander
completely
seduce
the
senses
even
as
the
ale
carries
an
orange
soda
pop
character
this
is
a
nice
little
beer
which
to
me
tastes
more
like
a
belgium
witte
than
an
ipa
drinks
very
easy
but
not
one
to
session
on
i
was
already
a
little
tired
of
the
flavor
profile
after
about
4
ounces
could
do
a
few
in
august
im
sure
would
rather
have
a
blue
moon
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
because
i
tend
to
like
wheat
beers
okay
appearance
not
the
murky
look
that
i
like
of
wheat
beer
and
decent
smell
but
kinda
weak
taste
was
much
better
than
expected
after
look
and
smell
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
will
revisit
unless
the
cost
is
good
also
loses
points
due
to
being
below
5
not
half
bad
bit
nothing
really
pops
here
nothing
lively
rjt
witbiers
are
never
usually
my
favorite
but
this
at
least
is
a
decent
take
on
the
style
and
on
par
with
lost
coasts
great
white
beer
inoffensive
simple
and
does
the
trick
if
all
theres
only
a
bunch
of
adjunct
lagers
otherwise
laying
around
i
do
wish
the
body
were
thicker
to
accentuate
the
playful
wheat
notes
but
its
definitely
a
decent
option
for
those
looking
for
a
simple
beer
to
sip
on
during
the
lazy
warmer
days
of
the
year
overall
i
thought
this
was
decent
beer
and
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
a
belgian
white
ale
i
was
a
little
worried
that
the
taste
might
be
too
coriander
and
orange
peel
forward
since
the
aroma
was
pretty
intense
with
it
but
it
was
fairly
balanced
when
i
got
to
the
taste
and
that
helped
the
drinkability
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
pretty
crisp
a
little
fizzy
not
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
at
holding
my
attention
i
think
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
row
but
i
think
i
might
start
to
get
bored
with
it
after
that
and
i
think
this
would
make
for
a
nice
spring
time
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
balance
in
the
taste
no
aspect
was
too
overpowering
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
light
and
fizzy
for
the
style
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
but
i
might
consider
it
if
im
really
in
the
mood
for
this
style
and
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
all
in
all
i
didnt
love
this
beer
but
i
didnt
hate
it
either
it
kind
of
fell
right
in
the
middle
for
me
and
i
dont
find
it
to
be
that
memorable
but
i
would
say
its
still
pretty
solid
as
far
as
the
style
goes
keep
up
the
solid
works
guys
o
not
impressed
o
really
a
decent
witbier
nice
attempt
at
the
style
by
shiner
pours
a
hazy
straw

in
color
with
about
a
half
of
a
finger
white
head
that
settles
down
to
the
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
the
aroma
is
of
corriander
wheat
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
the
taste
is
actually
even
better
and
a
tad
on
the
sweet
side
clean
finish
with
a
hint
of
banana
but
i
am
sure
there
isnt
any
in
there
overall
a
decent
brew
overall
white
wing
is
much
better
than
most
of
the
beers
that
shiner
produces
its
not
even
in
the
same
league
as
what
i
would
consider
good
witbiers
and
i
doubt
id
buy
another
bottle
but
i
dont
regret
sipping
this
one
overall
a
good
beer
definitely
a
great
session

a

fine

that
comes
across
wellbalanced
decently
complex
and
delightfully
tasty
smoothness
warmth
and
a
subtle
yet
varied
fruitiness
and
spiciness
all
come
together
and
make
a
tasty
beverage
perfect
for
anyone
looking
for
a
lighter
bodied
and
flavored
beer
but
with
substance
and
intrigue
o
definitely
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
one
that
pairs
well
with
spicier
foods
im
having
it
today
with
some
chili
light
and
refreshing
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
look
forward
to
sampling
it
on
tap
in
the
future
overall
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
a
good
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
different
enough
to
be
of
interest
light
enough
not
to
offend
most
shiner
white
wine
is
going
to
replace
shiner
hefeweizen
if
sources
are
correct
and
is
only
the
second
time
shiner
has
ever
brewed
a
beer
of
this
style
i
find
it
a
nice
alternative
to
other
belgian
wits
and
i
like
that
it
is
a
little
less
sweet
than
most
it
offers
some
good
refreshment
and
would
make
a
good
choice
of
beer
on
a
hot
day
its
lighter
refreshment
still
offers
enough
taste
and
body
to
satisfy
craft
beer
fans
while
still
remaining
approachable
enough
to
satisfy
the
macro
brew
crowd
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
will
purchase
again
this
is
a
nice
warm
weather
belgian
inspired
brew
thats
definitely
geared
to
a
wider
market
than
craft
been
aficionados
its
a
nice
alternative
to
blue
moon
its
easy
drinking
and
tastes
good
enough
to
have
a
few
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
shiner
beers
i
will
definitely
be
keeping
some
around
through
the
summer
months

b
overall
one
of
my
favorite
witbier
perfect
while
eating
comparable
with
other
leading
belgian
whites
this
is
amazing
belgian
ale
the
best
witbier
i
ever
tried
overall
as
belgian
witbiers
go
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
although
i
like
hoegaarden
and
its
ilk
this
just
seems
to
be
a
cut
above
them
would
be
a
goto
witbier
if
it
were
more
readily
available
and
id
certainly
have
no
hesitation
about
having
it
on
tap
generally
a
fan
of
the
style
this
one
was
pretty
good
very
clean
and
smooth
sweet
and
somewhere
between
orange
and
lemon
in
the
taste
a
little
spice
coriander
does
not
really
stand
out
but
lingers
very
tasty
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
optimal
summer
beer
a
little
thin
or
maybe
i
would
say
flat
extremely
enjoyable
beer
that
i
would
gladly
enjoy
at
anytime
if
you
like
wheathefewit
this
is
a
good
one
if
you
want
hop
move
on
really
effing
tasty
i
love
the
look
of
this
hazy
thick
head
with
amazing
retention
a
pear
like
light
honey
and
straw
yellow
blend
the
carbonation
looks
so
lively
like
an
alka
seltzer
tablet
was
dropped
inside
aroma
is
citrusy
and
sugary
sweet
especially
orange
not
surprising
considering
the
bottle
says
it
was
brewed
with
orange
peel
tasty
is
mostly
citrusy
and
orange
sweet
a
very
refreshing
taste
like
an
orange
soda
i
mean
this
in
a
good
way
feel
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
carbonation
really
settles
and
there
is
very
little
left
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
i
drank
this
on
a
super
cold
east
coast
mid
november
evening
i
could
see
how
this
beer
would
be
even
better
in
the
summer
however
i
had
it
with
a
light
and
healthy
meal
of
broiled
salmon
brussel
sprouts
and
pear
salad
and
they
complemented
each
other
nicely

lovely
light
lemony
flavor
where
was
this
wonderfulness
during
the
summer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
garaje
in
sf
i
find
the
spice
notes
overpowering
in
most
white
ales
not
this
one
its
not
as
good
or
as
complex
as
allagash
white
but
definitely
a
quality
beer
overall
i
cant
imagine
a
better
session
beer
for
a
hot
day
i
would
not
hesitate
to
pick
up
a
six
pack
for
soaking
up
some
sun
if
i
knew
where
to
find
one
the
first
thing
i
noticed
in
this
beer
is
the
lack
of
any
yeasty
flavoraroma
which
is
a
huge
plus
in
my
book
lovely
bright
color
and
a
faint
aroma
of
orange
peel
couldnt
quite
taste
the
coriander
but
it
didnt
bother
me
too
much
overall
a
very
refreshing
beer
light
body
high
carbonation
overall
a
refreshing
flavorful
witbier
a
good
summer
drink
that
i
would
gladly
have
again
especially
on
a
hot
day
flavors
of
apple
ginger
lemon
soft
coriander
super
clean
finish
great
session
beer
too
wheaty
and
citrusy
for
me
overall
very
mediocre
really
hard
to
find
noteworthy
merits
this
is
light
bodied
and
moderately
carbonated
this
is
very
easy
drinking
overall
not
bad
and
id
probably
drink
it
again
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
wit
one
of
my
favorite
beers
so
far
kind
of
a
disneyesque
rendition
of
the
style
the
coriander
and
wheat
malt
sweetness
more
or
less
exaggerated
for
our
amusement
it
would
seem
easy
to
drink
but
not
all
that
complex
as
duly
noted
and
not
something
i
could
see
myself
repeating
outside
of
the
goofy
marketing
trope
that
sucked
me
in
here
pours
straw
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
head
dissipates
after
a
few
minutes
with
effervescent
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
smell
of
belgian
yeasts
and
coriander
there
is
a
slightly
sour
component
to
it
strong
malty
banana
taste
up
front
follow
by
moderate
carbonation
with
a
spicy
coriander
taste
at
the
end
very
refreshing
beer
high
carbonation
witbiers
were
my
first
foray
into
craft
beers
hoegaarden
but
i
have
moved
on
to
other
tastes
mainly
hoppy
ipas
and
pale
ales
this
beer
provides
a
refreshing
nostalgic
feel
though
i
am
not
normally
a
huge
fan
of
witbiers
as
i
find
the
coriander
taste
to
be
a
little
unpalatable
but
this
beer
is
a
change
it
is
quite
tasty
and
really
refreshing
nothing
extraordinary
but
certainly
very
drinkable
and
a
great
option
on
a
hot
day
prost
the
hint
of
coriander
brings
out
a
crisp
clean
flavor
when
served
with
and
orange
slice
lemon
slice
or
just
by
itself
when
im
sitting
by
the
pool
in
the
summer
i
call
it
my
lemonade
because
its
so
refreshing
the
belgians
make
the
best
beer
and
chocolate
in
the
world
and
this
beer
is
my
favorite
whitewit
served
by
the
can
is
not
as
flavorful
as
the
glass
bottle
or
the
tap
overall
very
nice
drinkable
witbier
nothing
too
exciting
but
certainly
nothing
offensive
overall
easy
fresh
and
simple
nothing
too
exciting
random
but
does
its
job
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
small
foamy
head
that
fades
to
bits
of
lacing
aroma
of
fruit
some
coriander
wheat
spice
and
touch
of
yeast
taste
of
citrus
fruit
and
spice
with
some
wheat
mild
bitterness
with
a
tart
finish
fairly
light
body
quite
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
grainy
texture
decent
beer
for
the
style
but
nothing
special
i
dont
usually
like
witbier
and
to
be
honest
i
bought
this
thinking
it
was
a
sour
because
of
the
name
still
turned
out
to
be
quite
refreshing
i
really
love
the
smell
but
it
dissipates
quickly
and
the
head
as
well
flavor
wise
this
is
pretty
good
tasty
witbier
good
for
a
change
even
if
you
have
a
preferred
brand
given
its
originality
excellent
beer
slight
hint
of
orange
with
a
defined
wheat
taste
and
a
slight
creamy
aftertaste
ive
had
this
in
a
bottle
a
long
time
ago
and
remembered
the
aftertaste
being
a
little
stronger
in
the
can
it
is
a
little
subtle
as
is
the
taste
as
a
whole
had
it
been
a
little
stronger
i
would
have
rated
this
a
5
overall
still
an
excellent
beer
in
a
can
or
a
bottle
drinkability
is
great
a
clasic
wit
exhibiting
all
the
best
characteristics
pretty
mich
a
qentissential
seession
beer
for
me
although
i
could
use
the
orange
dialed
back
a
touch
i
complained
to
the
bar
about
it
and
got
this
beer
off
of
my
tab
i
couldnt
imagine
that
the
bar
messed
it
up
as
it
seems
to
be
a
brewing
problem
ill
definitely
rereview
when
i
have
this
again
undrinkable
obviously
with
the
diacetyl
a
lawnmowing
beer
if
cold
mouthfeel
heavily
carbonated
with
bubbles
that
feel
large
on
the
tongue
this
counterbalances
the
full
bodied
feel
from
the
suspended
matter
floating
around
in
the
beer
i
think
i
would
want
to
have
just
slightly
less
carbonation
to
emphasize
the
unfiltrated
nature
rather
than
seem
to
diminish
its
effects
as
i
kept
drinking
this
and
the
carbonation
started
to
come
out
of
the
beer
it
started
tasting
more
how
i
wanted
it
to
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
above
average
but
certainly
less
than
anything
astoundingly
notable
overall
this
beer
is
truly
a
classic
that
one
can
enjoy
from
time
to
time
i
know
i
will
ive
recommended
this
beer
so
many
times
that
ive
forgotten
i
havent
actually
had
it
myself
wow
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
cloudy
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
cracked
wheat
coriander
clove
lemon
zest
and
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
emphasis
placed
on
the
spices
though
the
lemony
wheat
surely
isnt
mild
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
drying
finish
overall
a
solid
spicy
wit
worthy
of
all
of
those
recommendations
ive
given
out
in
the
past
in
all
a
slightly
less
than
balanced
brew
from
lefebvre
sa
that
i
expected
more
of
by
no
means
is
it
bad
but
when
it
warms
it
becomes
brainier
than
expected
surprisingly
disappointed
for
my
four
pack
that
costs
around
12
had
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
it
hit
the
spot
on
a
nice
spring
day
light
and
refreshing
with
good
fruit
flavor
o
3
5
lots
of
spice
flavor
in
this
one
with
peppercorn
coriander
and
citrus
making
up
the
main
taste
not
bad
but
a
bit
unbalanced
and
thin
feeling
o
nice
refreshing
summer
beer
not
the
best
wit
ive
had
but
i
would
feel
at
home
sessioning
a
few
of
these
on
the
porch
on
tap
in
belgium
this
beer
of
course
reminds
you
of
a
typical
belgian
wit
light
yellow
with
that
unfiltered
cloudy
appearance
aromas
of
wheat
and
definitely
orange
peel
similar
taste
with
the
only
distinguishing
feature
of
this
one
is
it
is
a
little
hoppier
than
most
i
like
the
style
but
nothing
exciting
stands
out
with
this
brew
overall
a
nice
beer
very
reasonably
priced
and
comes
in
a
can
for
summer
drinking
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
respectable
nothrills
witbier
the
essentials
are
there
but
theyre
a
little
out
of
balance
and
the
body
is
lacking
probably
would
go
better
with
a
warm
summers
day
than
an
unseasonably
cool
spring
evening
rjt
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
a
perfect
beer
for
a
warm
spring
afternoon
out
in
the
sun
or
at
a
summer
picnic
overall
drinkability
solidly
above
average
witbier
tasty
very
drinkable
i
could
have
had
another
easily
but
i
was
seduced
by
all
the
other
beers
on
the
menu
i
can
imagine
this
would
be
quite
good
with
food
only
the
aroma
was
a
letdown
i
love
beer
i
got
to
know
the
bartenders
pretty
well
at
my
go
to
pub
and
one
of
them
suggested
blanche
to
me
i
immediately
fell
in
love
hands
down
my
favorite
beer
no
matter
what
time
of
year
hot
or
cold
climate
ive
only
ever
had
this
beer
on
tap
but
would
love
to
try
it
other
ways
i
highly
suggest
also
trying
this
beer
with
a
shot
of
a
strawberry
lambic
sooo
good
manakin
pis
is
actually
pretty
good
nice
and
light
more
of
a
hot
weather
beverage
though
it
has
an
unexpected
pale
yellow
color
and
cloudiness
from
the
high
level
of
wheat
used
the
bitter
orange
added
during
brewing
comes
across
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
good
beer
as
a
break
from
all
the
heavier
winter
beers
while
still
being
appropriate
for
the
season
poured
from
a
16
5
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
yellowwhiteish
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
spices
some
fruits
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
spices
mild
fruits
highly
drinkable
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
a
rather
mediocre
witbier
even
coming
from
belgium
the
other
person
i
had
this
with
told
me
it
tasted
like
rice
as
it
warmed
up
while
i
dont
exactly
agree
it
does
indeed
get
grainier
and
more
astringent
as
it
sits
and
none
of
the
yeasty
phenolic
notes
intended
for
these
types
of
beers
end
up
sprouting
out
for
the
price
8
its
not
the
worst
but
it
is
sadly
underwhelming
overall
o
this
beer
serves
every
purpose
one
can
sip
it
and
spend
time
distinguishing
its
special
characteristics
and
one
can
just
as
easily
grab
a
bunch
of
tallboys
and
knock
them
back
without
thinking
about
it
especially
given
the
pleasantlylow
abv
very
impressive
cant
wait
for
all
beer
to
come
in
cans
poured
from
pint
can
into
a
goblet
this
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
large
but
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
crisp
fruity
light
citrus
with
a
few
spices
the
feel
is
medium
with
tingly
carbonination
the
taste
is
light
also
but
decent
a
little
wheat
some
sourness
a
little
citrus
but
all
crisp
and
light
not
bad
but
i
prefer
a
slightly
bolder
beer
o
this
is
a
really
easy
drinking
beer
the
funkiness
of
this
beer
can
be
a
bit
overwhelming
at
times
but
overall
its
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
i
drink
this
again
if
given
the
opportunity
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
very
refreshing
and
i
could
see
drinking
this
again
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
decent
white
wheat
beer
head
that
well
tolerates
before
gradually
subsiding
to
thin
foamy
layer
atop
the
appearance
looks
familiar
to
other
typical
belgian
wheat
beers
however
upon
a
sniff
it
blows
a
surprisingly
inviting
aroma
comprising
of
banana
orange
coriander
and
some
spice
well
mellow
the
taste
is
good
and
quite
exquisite
by
the
fruity
estery
touch
leading
by
banana
orange
peel
along
with
some
spice
from
coriander
and
clove
hop
plays
behind
a
curtain
by
adding
vague
bitterness
medium
in
term
of
body
rejuvenating
the
palate
with
lively
carbonation

makes
it
much

refreshing
yet
mostly
unsatisfying
judging
from
the

content

to
be
there
with

though
overall
nice
to

probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
smooth
for
a

a

fuller
this
is
a
good

is

really

high
recommended
witbier
i
dont
typically
enjoy
the
orangey
sweet
versions
of
the
style
this
ones
a
bit
drier
and
i
must
liken
it
to
a
true
belgian
blue
moon
the
beer
to
get
all
of
you
coors
drinkers
away
from
that
particular
beer
and
into
something
a
little
more
complex
the
main
thing
this
has
going
for
it
is
the
flavor
its
different
i
feel
like
its
dominated
by
blueberries
like
everywhere
fresh
blueberries
a
bit
of
underlying
yeast
but
its
all
an
odd
blueberry
flavor
just
everywhere
i
will
readily
cop
to
having
agitated
the
can
as
i
wanted
any
lees
to
be
in
suspension
and
not
flocculated
at
the
bottom
of
the
can
as
a
result
the
crack
unleashed
a
brief
spray
of
beer
and
foam
before
i
could
get
the
glug
started
no
cansualties
were
reported
and
soon
i
had
what
can
only
be
described
as
lemon
meringue
pie
in
a
glass
i
was
looking
at
a
finger
of
flluffy
dense
bone
white
head
with
excellent
retention
above
a
cloudy
palelemon
yellow
liquid
nose
was
quite
musty
very
yeastdriven
mouthfeel
was
creamy
like
soft
serve
ice
cream
or
instant
pudding
and
the
taste
was
of
bananas
and
old
newspapers
very
musty
wild
finish
was
semidry
and
the
mustiness
really
lingered
plus
a
lemony
tartness
began
to
come
through
as
a
selfavowed
hophead
one
would
be
plenty
but
for
those
who
enjoy
this
style
having
it
in
a
can
makes
it
a
good
choice
for
the
beach
bottom
line
if
you
like
blue
moon
this
is
all
you
beer
is
light
with
a
grainy
finish
not
a
great
wit
but
a
decent
one
for
the
price
interesting
overall
but
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
a
super
super
light
beer
would
need
gallons
of
this
to
get
drunk
or
full
which
isnt
necessarily
a
minus
pours
cloudy
and
glowing
pale
pale
yellow
in
color
2
inch
white
head
smell
is
quite
citrusy
with
lots
of
belgian
yeast
making
things
exciting
flavor
is
the
same
as
the
nose
yeasty
and
fruit
insanely
light
i
wanted
more
from
this
beer
in
terms
of
flavor
its
good
but
its
watered
down
i
think
feel
is
very
very
light
on
body
with
pretty
bright
carbonation
and
some
creamy
texture
this
is
one
of
the
easiest
drinking
belgian
beers
ive
tastes
a
pretty
good
with
overall
but
so
many
others
can
do
the
trick
just
as
well
or
better
this
was
good
but
i
had
higher
hopes
o
nice
belgian
wit
not
much
complexity
here
but
its
very
crisp
and
enjoyable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
lemonade
like
appearance
poured
from
a
16
ounce
pounder
can
labeled
straight
blanche
de
bruxelles
leaving
out
the

and

like
arising

rising

aroma
especially
citrictropical
fruit
is
really
nice

coriander
earthy
herbal
hints
a
very
complex

this
may
change
some
minds
about
the
style
spicy
yeast
complexity
with
a
touch
of
acidity
rising
out
of
my
glass
flavors
are
bright
with
apricot
lemon
and
a
creamy
wheat
flavor
that
really
balances
things
out
along
with
yeast
esters
and
spice
additions
especially
the
coriander
actually
leaves
ample
bitterness
with
the
spice
lingering
on
definitely
complex
mouthfeel
is
creamy
texture
medium
bodied
tight
flowing
carbonation
overall
impression
of
this
beer
is
excellent
a
grade
a
witbier
like
i
said
this
one
may
just
change
some
minds
for
those
who
say
they
dont
like
this
style
the
palate
opens
crisp
ultra
light
and
quite
refreshing
flavors
of
coriander
rose
water
citrus
less
bitter
orange
peel
and
more
ripe
oranges
and
orange
juice
the
midpalate
is
a
little
watery
with
a
crackerlike
wheat
character
quenching
and
crisply
carbonated
this
beer
finishes
a
little
watery
with
a
light
coriander
note
a
little
bit
of
orange
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
wheat
tartness
quite
nice
very
drinkable
overall
i
dont
understand
all
the
latest
hate
on
this
beer
its
got
a
good
balanced
taste
sessionable
abv
and
even
now
comes
in
a
can
will
have
to
look
for
this
when
i
need
something
light
to
pound
with
a
ton
of
balanced
flavors
overall
this
beer
is
ok
and
it
seems
wellenough
crafted
but
its
flavor
profile
is
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
a
witbier
this
seriously
tastes
like
someone
poured
a
shot
of
cointreau
into
a
hoegaarden
very
cloudy
belgian
white
with
an
underpowered
malt
background
providing
a
sweetish
tastewhich
is
decent
definitely
enjoyable
at
the
right
time
and
cloying
sweet
mouthfeeldefinitely
not
so
good
overall
a
decent
beer
for
cooling
off
nothing
to
write
home
about
m
medium
body
however
it
needs
to
be
served
cold
like
4
degree
after
it
gets
a
bit
warmer
i
can
sense
the
alcohol
in
my
mouth
brings
less
peasure
blanche
de
bruxelles
might
not
have
a
y
chromosome
but
its
a
damn
pleasant
beer
to
drink
especially
when
the
weather
is
nice
it
probably
belongs
more
so
at
a
table
of
jupiler
drinkers
than
it
does
st
bernardus
but
in
all
honesty
falls
somewhere
between
the
two

worse
i
recommend
this
wit
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
now
belgian
lawnmower
beer
pours
a
murky
whitish
orange
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
broken
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
jasmine
tea
perfume
and
light
citrus
fruits
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
and
to
me
this
tastes
very
much
like
jasmine
tea
this
beer
has
a
light
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
really
doesnt
seem
like
beer
in
some
regards
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
refreshing
and
zesty
on
the
tongue
a
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
this
would
be
nice
on
a
springsummer
day
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
smells
of
fresh
wheat
and
a
bit
of
lemon
sweet
bread
flavors
start
the
flavors
out
followed
by
some
spicy
coriander
and
a
lemony
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
overall
a
good
witbeer
i
would
get
this
again
o
this
might
very
well
be
the
best
witbier
i
ever
had
i
had
this
beer
in
the
fridge
for
over
12
months
i
dont
know
if
it
changed
anything
to
the
beer
because
it
seems
very
awesome
and
the
reviews
seem
to
show
its
more
of
a
meh
beer
anyway
its
not
a
beer
that
i
will
fiend
for
in
the
future
or
really
remember
again
until
i
see
it
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
it
down
the
flavor
is
nuanced
and
layered
with
coriander
sage
citrus
zest
all
playing
in
the
background
a
pleasing
melody
wonderful
sweet
finish
well
like
that
label
says
it
is
white
it
is
also
cloudy
with
two
generous
fingers
of
head
there
is
some
good
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
pretty
bland
nothing
much
going
on
here
there
is
subtle
orange
flavor
upfront
but
it
tastes
pretty
bland
as
well
there
is
a
nice
bitter
finish
which
is
the
best
part
of
this
offering
just
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
this
belgian
white
poured
an
hazy
yellow
white
color
with
very
little
foam
the
flavor
was
sort
of
flat
with
a
sourbitter
taste
and
very
little
in
the
flavor
department
the
smell
had
a
yeasty
aroma
and
not
much
of
anything
else
to
a
well
balance
ale
lacking
flavor
aroma
in
all
departments
notes
this
beer
has
more
body
than
other
witbiers
that
i
have
tried
subtle
carbonation
lends
a
very
silky
mouthfeel
tasty
and
quite
refreshing
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
to
date
overall
impression
an
average
witbier
until
the
finish
and
it
was
ruined
overly
priced
as
well
for
this
one
i
will
not
be
returning
for
another
one
of
these
ever
and
will
probably
steer
people
away
from
this
if
i
were
to
see
it
ontapbottle
there
are
plenty
of
other
witbiers
out
there
why
not
enjoy
the
good
ones
i
would
recommend
giving
this
one
a
try
it
could
almost
suffice
in
terms
of
refreshment
as
a
glass
of
water
on
a
hot
day
this
beer
poured
out
with
a
nice
hazy
yellow
color
to
it
the
head
was
fizzy
and
white
but
does
have
a
bit
of
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
of
this
beer
had
a
nice
fresh
citrus
aroma
to
it
with
healthy
does
of
yeast
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
lightly
flavors
with
what
seems
to
be
lemons
and
has
a
good
amount
of
wheat
in
the
aftertaste
to
smooth
things
out
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
refreshing
smooth
and
drinkable
just
about
whenever
overall
id
only
wanna
have
this
in
the
warmer
months
but
it
is
a
nice
brew
all
around
not
bad
the
color
befits
the
label
which
is
a
treasure
a
boy
peeing
it
has
that
color
but
the
taste
is
right
there
where
it
should
be
fruity
yeasty
hoppy
very
nice
and
clean
this
is
one
to
try
when
you
want
to
try
some
of
the
lighter
side
11
2
ounce
bottle
i
found
a
single
of
this
so
i
thought
id
try
it
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
color
with
about
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
wheat
lemon
and
orange
peel
and
coriander
it
tastes
like
oranges
orange
peel
coriander
wheat
and
lemon
peel
i
think
i
pick
up
more
orangeorange
peel
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
compared
to
the
other
witbiers
ive
had
in
the
past
mouthfeelbody
is
light
its
crisp
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
think
its
a
good
refreshing
beer
id
buy
this
again
its
a
good
choice
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
or
any
day
overall
a
very
nice
little
witbeir
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
not
get
bored
overall
for
someone
who
may
not
like
stronger
citrusbanana
taste
in
the
wit
beers
this
beer
would
be
a
good
choice
i
think
i
will
drink
this
a
bit
more
often
during
the
summer
as
opposed
to
the
more
mainstreamed
fare
you
can
find
in
grocery
stores
im
sorry
but
the
beer
keeps
on
screaming
drink
me
this
witbier
pours
as
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
and
has
a
light
white
lacing
the
aroma
gives
off
a
slightly
sour
smell
that
isnt
offputting
within
the
aroma
you
also
get
a
mild
orange
peel
smell
some
lemon
zest
and
a
faint
spiciness
from
the
coriander
when
you
take
a
sip
the
sourness
from
the
aroma
shows
itself
slightly
in
the
taste
but
isnt
overpowering
once
that
fades
you
get
an
enjoyable
balance
between
lemon
and
citrus
thats
light
in
body
and
leaves
the
tongue
clean
malts
also
give
this
beer
a
slightly
sweet
taste
that
doesnt
take
over
presentation
packaged
in
a
335
ml
eurostyle
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
overall
a
great
beer
here
this
is
probably
my
favorite
witbier
and
is
truly
an
exceptional
beverage
the
added
fruitiness
isnt
exactly
to
style
but
it
is
pleasant
nonetheless
my
favorite
thing
about
this
beer
compared
with
other
members
of
the
style
is
that
it
avoids
vegetal
coriander
notes
which
are
common
in
most
witbiers
but
shouldnt
be
delicious
refreshing
thirstquenching
and
nearperfect
d
very
enjoyable
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
session
for
sure
d
great
stuff
unique
and
flavorful
one
can
be
enjoyed
once
in
a
while
poured
out
in
a
wineglass
this
beer
looks
like
a
whitebeer
should
two
finger
head
and
a
cloudy
yellow
fluid
with
no
carbonation
citrusnotes
together
with
koriander
some
sweetness
in
this
beer
but
very
nice
to
drink
mo
everything
except
the
taste
of
this
fits
the
bill
for
a
wit
it
just
isnt
that
tasty
and
refreshing
pale
yellow
transparent
lemony
nose
with
wheat
to
identify
the
witbier
the
first
lick
the
lemon
in
the
nose
is
reminiscent
of
lemon
meringue
her
mouth
is
smaller
just
with
the
zest
of
citrus
and
wheat
and
smooth
without
bitterness
or
spice
lack
of
personality
in
the
body
and
structure
but
easy
to
drink
very
good
refreshing
beer
in
the
summer
however
may
accompany
dishes
with
a
delicate
flavor
even
in
cold
weather
super
easy
to
drink
thirst
quenching
could
pound
a
number
of
these
at
one
time
a
summer
beer
nothing
complicated
and
rather
straight
forward
o
a
very
nice
wit
maybe
the
best
wit
ive
had
this
brew
has
a
nice
balance
and
mixture
of
flavors
and
quenches
the
thirst
my
wife
had
this
one
on
tap
last
tuesday
afternoon
at
the
wynkoop
brewery
served
in
a
tulip
poured
a
cloudy
hazy
pale
straw
color
with
a
big
white
head
aromas
of
coriander
wheat
and
light
citrus
well
carbonated
and
light
bodied
with
flavors
of
wheat
citrus
and
coriander
this
beer
is
a
strange
one
its
what
i
imagine
most
homebrewers
are
actually
producing
every
time
i
hear
oberon
clone
the
orange
peel
coriander
combo
punch
is
very
present
and
almost
overwhelms
the
light
sensibilities
of
this
particular
brew
the
head
and
carbonation
were
pretty
cool
it
was
light
and
foamy
and
effervescent
drinkable
in
the
spring
or
after
mowing
my
yard
this
is
very
refreshing
and
delicate
nice
color
and
all
that
jazz
hops
meh
not
all
that
distinguishable
pretty
good
beer
despite
its
unique
qualities
it
is
very
drinkable
i
am
excited
to
try
it
again
soon
drink
just
an
average
beer
im
happy
i
gave
it
a
shot
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
grade
bottled
d
its
not
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
sizzle
hopheads
should
look
elsewhere
but
this
does
what
a
beer
should
it
satisfies
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
i
love
wits
and
this
one
does
it
right
love
the
orange
and
really
love
the
high
amounts
of
coriander
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
moderate
in
alcohol
content
excellent
choice
for
those
that
love
wheat
beer
drink
very
nice
for
the
style
will
have
to
have
it
again
during
the
hot
summer
months
the
presentation
of
the
lemon
in
this
beer
is
the
best
ive
had
it
makes
the
beer
have
a
refreshing
quality
and
its
fantastic
for
throwing
in
the
middle
of
a
beer
session
in
between
heavy
stoutstripels
a
real
palate
cleanser
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer

strangely
attractive

some
little
kid
whizzed
to
put
out
a
fire
cheers
unbalanced
too
much
yeast
and
coriander
with
no
balance
final
thoughts
another
good
beer
from
great
divide
and
a
style
i
dont
typically
enjoy
no
less
highly
recommended
for
anyone
new
to
belgians
or
looking
for
a
lighter
option
within
the
genre
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
easy
to
drink
yet
not
a
lot
of
flavor
overall
pretty
bad
just
cause
you
overload
a
beer
with
so
much
spices
that
you
cant
taste
the
beer
itself
doesnt
make
it
a
witbier
and
def
doesnt
make
it
good
this
is
again
that
american
idea
of
candying
up
and
spicing
up
a
european
style
of
beer
so
it
fits
the
typical
american
palate
but
ends
up
destroying
the
beer
where
is
the
wheat
too
so
little
actual
wheat
thin
too
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
with
a
watery
feel
a
light
body
and
a
grainy
aftertaste
that
just
kind
of
hands
around
like
eating
a
piece
of
dry
toast
with
margarine
average
is
the
best
way
to
describe
this
brew
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
as
noteworthy
and
it
was
just
alright
overall
o
a
decent
belgian
style
witbier
light
spritzy
and
crisp
pleasant
wheaty
taste
with
just
enough
spice
modestly
flavored
and
richly
carbonated
a
great
summer
brew
i
dont
see
anything
wrong
with
this
its
a
clean
and
sharpish
witbier
golden
color
with
a
white
cap
in
the
ommegang
chalice
from
the
12
oz
bottle
in
the
sixpack
purchased
at
litickers
liquor
in
ocean
beach
beer
3
on
this
great
divide
sample
night
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
whiteishyellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
mild
light
spice
and
wheat
taste
is
also
mild
some
spices
a
very
light
wheat
refreshing
but
on
the
bland
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
nothing
offensive
but
a
mediocre
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
creamy
like
head
that
doesnt
last
long
and
leaves
barely
a
lace
of
foam
on
top
it
has
a
a
weak
nose
barely
hints
of
spices
and
yeast
the
taste
is
balanced
with
spices
and
yeast
with
some
bright
fruit
it
is
fullbodied
and
very
balanced
in
the
palate
overall
it
is
a
nice
summer
fall
beer
very
bright
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
slightly
hazed
very
pale
yellow
there
is
a
shortlasting
creamyish
white
head
that
leaves
just
a
hint
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
faint
with
just
hints
of
fruity
esters
spices
and
yeast
the
taste
is
equally
anemic
the
body
is
much
fuller
than
expected
given
its
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
nice
fullness
to
it
and
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
on
the
finish
not
terrible
but
certainly
lacking
a
rare
miss
from
great
divide
othis
beer
is
refreshing
enough
but
i
think
it
tries
to
do
too
much
the
mixture
of
hoppy
almostipa
flavors
doesnt
jive
well
with
the
witbier
flavors
that
being
said
this
beer
is
far
from
a
drain
pour
and
drinks
well
enough
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
could
see
this
pairing
well
with
thai
food
having
this
in
a
nonic
pint
pours
a
pearly
yellow
wife
said
its
almost
green
with
no
major
head
light
visible
suspension
and
kindof
an
oily
look
to
the
surface
not
too
much
to
be
said
for
the
appearance
though
i
do
give
it
points
for
some
haze
smells
yeasty
and
funky
maybe
some
light
lemon
zest
not
getting
a
lot
off
the
nose
i
must
say
watery
saggy
mouthfeel
not
much
flavor
almost
seems
a
little
flat
has
a
little
zest
to
it
and
a
medium
to
light
sweetness
but
just
tastes
like
a
watered
down
beer
or
maybe
even
lemonade
to
me
was
expecting
something
like
a
hoegaarden
but
this
beer
does
not
come
close
i
think
this
is
the
second
season
theyve
done
it
and
i
hope
its
the
last
gd
give
this
one
the
boot
and
make
a
real
wheat
waste
of
a
seasonal
spot
o
overall
smooth
drinking
with
a
spicy
bite
over
not
too
bad
easy
drinking
just
a
bit
too
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
watery
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
offered
to
me
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
seeking
it
out
overall
a
nice
summer
wheat
ale
good
citrus
and
spice
notes
the
body
was
very
nice
smooth
even
crisp
and
with
decent
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
my
pint
was
gone
quickly
enough
overall
an
example
of
the
style
thats
missing
a
bit
a
pleasant
enough
quaff
but
not
a
particularly
notable
one
other
reviewers
suggested
different
yeasting
approach
since
yeast
is
so
significant
to
this
style
overall
not
one
of
the
better
witbiers
that
i
have
tried
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
forgettable
poured
into
a
large
tulip
heyday
sports
a
little
bit
of
fine
creamy
head
and
appears
a
hazy
yellowgold
aroma
is
mostly
of
earthy
orange
peelcoriander
and
slightly
milky
a
few
sips
reveal
a
pleasant
sweetness
and
yeast
complexity
mingling
with
a
nice
bit
of
carbonation
to
cut
thru
and
finish
cleanly
medium
bodied
but
finishes
pretty
clean
not
a
very
exciting
wit
but
its
well
made
and
i
dont
notice
any
big
flaws
in
it
if
witbier
is
your
thing
then
its
worth
a
try
o
although
this
beer
definitely
looks
like
a
witbier
it
lacks
the
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
properties
exhibited
by
many
of
the
beers
in
this
style
o
would
drink
again
but
not
in
love
with
this
one
in
the
witbier
style
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
crisp
refreshing
citrusy
tangy
c
this
is
a
good
summer
option
much
like
victory
summerlove
the
bittering
on
the
end
is
very
refreshing
for
this
summer
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
reasonable
amount
of
flavor
i
really
do
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
hot
hot
day
i
decided
to
try
this
one
even
been
thrown
off
by
the
low
score
what
a
great
surprise
this
is
a
solid
wit
it
is
definitely
on
my
top
5
the
taste
is
very
balanced
with
not
too
overpowering
combination
of
orange
and
coriander
goes
smooth
and
smells
great
very
easy
drinking
i
will
be
looking
for
more
definitely
a
hidden
gem
in
this
style
of
the
style
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
effort
from
great
divide
and
one
worth
getting
over
and
over
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
nothing
offensive
or
incredibly
bad
here
but
for
a
witbier
it
just
doesnt
deliver
the
depth
and
strength
of
flavoraroma
needed
somewhat
disappointed
for
the
first
time
by
gd
bring
back
st
brigids
feels
watered
down
overall
a
solid
wit
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
ill
give
them
the
effort
but
that
recipe
needs
to
be
tweaked
big
time
o
an
unoffensive
wellexecuted
summer
wheat
beer
very
easy
drinking
great
for
a
hot
day
i
dont
think
this
beer
is
winning
any
awards
but
its
not
trying
to
either
its
a
beer
thats
hard
not
to
like
but
hard
to
rave
about
overall
i
paid
3
bucks
for
this
since
i
like
to
try
whatever
great
divide
puts
out
and
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
needs
to
be
discontinued
or
even
better
have
a
recipe
change
overall
a
pretty
disappointing
beer
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
it
wasnt
bad
but
there
are
so
many
witbiers
that
i
would
select
before
this
one
too
bad
because
great
divide
has
an
otherwise
stellar
portfolio
notes
its
drinkable
and
a
decent
witbier
not
too
bad
for
a
warm
day
cheers
o
maybe
i
dont
get
the
style
so
i
went
with
fairly
mediocre
ratings
across
the
boards
if
you
are
more
familiar
than
i
am
with
the
witbier
style
this
may
be
a
better
beer
than
im
indicating
probably
good
for
drinking
out
in
the
sun
all
day
or
for
warm
summer
afternoon
sessions
but
it
is
not
representative
of
what
i
typically
want
in
a
beer
that
said
came
back
to
the
beer
a
few
days
later
and
it
vibed
a
little
better
with
me
o
a
fullflavored
sessionable
wheat
beer
from
none
other
than
the
good
people
at
great
divide
keep
the
good
suds
comin
guys
o
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
very
mild
not
much
there
overall
not
a
bad
belgian
wit
from
great
divide
makes
for
a
good
summer
option
and
has
some
good
characteristics
i
would
drink
this
again
with
no
qualms
this
is
a
rather
nice
light
beer
with
a
solid
flavor
profile
this
is
a
beer
brewed
to
style
that
could
satisfy
those
just
looking
for
a
witbier
or
those
who
are
looking
for
something
refreshing
to
knock
back
on
a
hot
day
i
enjoyed
this
one
had
this
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
pretty
nice
witbier
possibly
a
touch
underrated
the
look
is
a
very
light
haze
it
almost
looked
clear
at
the
thinner
part
of
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
much
of
a
head
here
either
the
aroma
and
taste
matched
very
well
very
light
cloves
and
soft
citrus
solid
tastecoriander
note
some
spicy
yeast
light
and
refreshing
enough
but
flavors
are
a
bit
muddled
a
middleoftheroad
witbier
in
a
style
with
a
lot
of
excellent
examples
overall
its
a
good
witbier
it
just
doesnt
stand
out
in
the
crowd
on
a
hot
day
this
one
will
drink
perfectly
otherwise
you
may
find
it
lacking
some
character
overall
less
than
averagei
actually
sent
it
back
as
i
thought
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
it
i
hope
that
i
was
wrong
i
will
give
it
another
shot
just
to
verify
a
little
t
e
lawrence
action
on
the
label
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
brassstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
cracked
wheat
dry
corn
light
egg
and
light
puffed
rice
the
taste
holds
notes
of
wheat
light
coriander
light
corn
and
very
light
egg
those
last
couple
bits
really
hold
this
stuff
back
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
sad
limp
little
wit
possibly
the
biggest
downer
ive
yet
had
from
great
divide
over
all
i
love
the
pairings
listed
on
the
bottle
i
do
happen
to
agree
with
them
gouda
cheese
belgian
waffles
kung
pao
chicken
this
is
a
good
beer
dont
let
my
review
fool
you
i
would
order
another
i
think
this
beer
would
compliment
those
pairing
rather
than
stand
on
its
own
o
good
at
times
but
never
really
comes
together
the
hops
notes
dont
work
here
there
are
so
much
better
wits
in
the
world
o
heyday
is
not
one
of
gds
better
brews
i
cant
think
of
a
time
i
would
select
this
one
over
hoegaarden
or
allagash
white
or
celis
white
the
clove
is
too
strong
and
ruins
an
otherwise
promising
malty
beer
a
different
fermentation
temp
or
profile
would
be
my
first
try
an
alternate
yeast
would
be
my
next
move
onot
sure
what
they
replaced
to
release
this
beer
but
they
should
have
kept
their
old
offering
o
while
this
isnt
the
worst
example
of
wit
ive
ever
had
it
certainly
wasnt
the
best
not
undrinkable
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
the
flavor
is
spot
on
white
ale
and
very
good
a
bit
heavy
in
the
malt
a
little
more
crispness
and
this
beer
would
be
best
in
class
a
very
good
offering
from
great
divide
and
may
become
my
go
to
belgian
white
as
it
is
a
local
brew
but
the
avery
white
rascal
is
good
as
well
though
problem
to
have
too
many
great
versions
of
a
hard
to
find
style
that
i
really
like
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
oats
and
slight
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
spice
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
very
grain
forward
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
wit
a
bit
sweet
and
overly
spiced
with
some
flavors
that
didnt
go
well
for
me
this
one
was
a
bit
hit
and
miss
for
me
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
summer
day
but
certainly
not
a
beer
id
order
in
the
cool
comfort
of
a
bar
an
enjoyable
well
done
wit
it
is
fairly
average
overall
with
no
one
aspect
being
particularly
memorable
a
good
beer
all
around
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
for
the
style
though
its
a
tough
style
to
crack
let
alone
perfect
great
go
at
it
though
overall
a
solid
witbier
that
has
some
nice
complexity
real
easy
to
sip
on
and
would
be
great
for
a
hot
day
overall
a
nice
hoppy
and
full
flavored
wit
perfect
for
the
summer
the
extra
hop
kick
gives
it
points
for
being
different
then
the
norm
easy
to
drink
with
good
balance
decent
price
its
a
winner
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
excellent
retention
and
laceing
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
candy
body
is
creamy
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
taste
is
of
lemonbubble
gumand
spice
a
bit
of
a
tart
finish
not
the
best
verison
of
this
style
but
worthy
of
a
try
loving
the
white
ale
trend
everybody
has
to
make
a
witbier
these
days
this
one
looks
good
in
the
classical
since
hazed
lemonade
body
with
a
bright
white
cloud
texture
head
aroma
has
soft
coriander
and
orange
peel
zinging
through
with
a
finishing
lemon
notes
i
love
it
flavor
is
creamy
with
the
wheat
notes
and
coriander
bitterness
citrus
peel
finish
has
me
wanting
more
of
this
stuff
thats
about
it
here
folks
body
is
medium
to
lighter
end
of
the
spectrum
with
ample
flowing
carbonation
finishes
with
a
spicy
boutique
of
spice
and
citrus
peel
colliding
overall
one
of
the
beers
i
wont
look
back
at
next
time
i
come
across
a
new
white
ale
overall
this
is
pretty
good
and
worth
checking
out
one
of
the
best
wits
ive
ever
had
o
refreshing
and
flavorful
witbier
with
nice
fruity
and
spicy
notes
great
divide
has
crafted
an
imminently
drinkable
summer
seasonal
with
heyday
it
doesnt
stray
from
style
so
it
might
not
be
quite
as
impressive
or
memorable
as
some
of
their
other
beer
but
it
still
deserves
praise
for
being
so
good
and
easy
to
drink
i
just
wish
it
wasnt
9
99sixpack
pours
a
hazy
sandy
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
offers
a
present
but
smooth
and
subtle
belgian
with
some
banana
a
little
hay
hints
of
orange
spices
clove
i
think
sugars
from
the
oats
alongside
the
wheat
malt
a
creamy
velvety
active
mouthfeel
overall
like
the
addition
of
the
oats
in
this
one
a
lot
but
not
a
wit
fan
and
this
one
wasnt
able
to
convert
me
wow
5th
review
this
must
have
just
emerged
the
pour
is
cloudy
and
bright
but
super
pale
and
lighter
the
head
is
fair
white
and
airy
but
fading
all
the
way
the
nose
is
mild
coriander
belgian
yeast
and
a
curious
malt
bill
supplemented
by
oatmeal
which
gives
some
interesting
weight
and
sugars
i
taste
some
citrus
orange
peel
or
pith
maybe
its
pretty
bitter
but
not
from
hops
more
than
any
defining
flavor
this
beer
has
a
defining
mouthfeel
its
effervescently
carbonated
like
seltzer
water
only
smaller
and
more
alive
bubbles
its
super
happening
in
the
mouth
which
is
right
on
for
the
first
spring
feeling
day
weve
had
here
this
beer
couldnt
have
come
out
at
a
better
time
and
it
kicks
the
crap
out
of
orabelle
and
colette
their
last
couple
of
weird
seasonal
offerings
that
need
never
come
back
this
is
first
great
divide
beer
to
impress
me
in
some
time
you
know
i
cant
splurge
for
the
barrel
aged
stuff
im
a
student
still
overall
this
is
a
beer
i
will
happily
be
drinking
all
summer
as
long
as
it
remains
on
the
shelves
impeccably
well
done
thanks
for
this
finally
something
interesting
and
not
watery
for
warm
weather
consumption
hard
to
keep
a
6er
around
long
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
both
people
who
like
wits
as
well
as
someone
who
isnt
opposed
to
wheat
and
wants
a
light
craft
offering
i
m
more
the
latter
so
i
just
thought
it
was
good
this
replaces
samurai
and
is
a
better
light
craft
beer
i
didnt
care
for
samurai
nonetheless
its
enjoyable
nomad
colette
and
orabelle
are
better
lightbodied
offerings
from
gd
though
of
course
i
had
to
taste
it
thankfully
the
aroma
isnt
in
the
flavor
maybe
slightly
but
the
orange
and
zestiness
come
to
the
rescue
a
bit
lemony
sweet
biscuit
underneath
finishes
slightly
dry
and
bubbly
id
have
to
try
this
side
by
side
with
colette
to
get
a
contrast
when
i
first
tried
colette
when
it
was
released
the
cream
corn
aroma
is
strong
too
hopefully
this
one
will
be
rid
of
it
soon
good
color
smooth
taste
with
slight
clove
hints
nice
beer
a
great
time
spring
beer
o
from
other
reviews
i
get
the
sense
that
what
i
tasted
was
off
in
some
way
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
not
bad
best
white
beer
ive
ever
had
prost
must
try
the
flow
is
excellent
and
theres
a
fluffy
creamy
softness
that
keeps
up
in
the
lightmedium
body
all
the
way
each
sip
is
bright
zesty
and
crisp
while
being
completely
smooth
as
well
o
as
the
name
suggests
what
we
have
here
is
a
bold
dosed
up
witbier
big
in
flavor
especially
with
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
but
still
tame
enough
to
drink
easily
its
an
enjoyable
brew
probably
my
favorite
witbier
to
date
full
almost
creamy
feel
light
hoppiness
yeast
light
spice
very
well
balanced
still
flavorful
no
blandness
just
the
right
level
of
spice
goes
down
very
clean
sessionable
and
over
6
5
abv
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
in
the
warm
season

this
would
be
great
with
mussels
white

light

veggies

overall
i
thought
this
was
very
average
on
the
whole
it
has
some
appealing
qualities
but
is
far
from
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
the
mac

i
had
with
it
was
the
star
of
the
meal
overall
i
feel
like
i
have
had
this
one
before
pretty
solid
and
refreshing
o
very
refreshing
beer
would
make
a
nice
summer
brew
o
recommended
for
fans
of
the
style
a
particularly
fruity
interpretation
of
the
style
super
refreshing
and
tasty
witbier
with
a
bold
malt
profile
if
just
to
be
compared
to
other
witbier
maybe
i
shouldve
given
some
extra
points
o
a
nice
witbier
with
good
flavor
an
overall
refreshing
brew
atmosphere
is
really
nice

balanced
with

lemon
citrus
and
just
a

of
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
i
really
get
where
they
were
going
with
this
its
definitely
bigger
than
the
average
wit
but
not
moronically
so
since
this
isnt
a
style
that
should
be
imperialized
it
still
works
quite
well
aroma
notwithstanding
this
would
be
really
good
in
the

just

worth
trying

a

i
would

buy
this
again
i
love
the
play
between
the
citrus

i
like
it
it
should
make
a
very
good
summer
ale
a
really
beer
in
the
style
as
it
has
spicy
notes
for
a
witbier
o
an
impressive
beer
with
a
nice
bitterness
overall
i
rather
like
this
beer
i
feel
like
the
doubleness
of
it
probably
detracts
more
than
it
helps
but
altogether
this
is
a
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
id
have
this
again
pours
a
light
yellow
color
in
the
glass
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
carbonation
is
larger
like
soda
pop
bubbles
but
a
ring
remains
around
the
glass
after
a
few
minutes
yeast
is
present
the
aroma
is
strong
for
a
witbier
citrus
and
mango
taste
is
sweet
leaning
more
towards
orange
but
maybe
with
a
hint
of
lemon
along
with
sweeter
flavors
like
mango
i
liked
this
a
lot
somewhere
between
a
saison
and
a
belgian
wit
the
pour
is
the
worst
feature
which
unfortunately
comes
first
its
clear
and
rusty
yellow
with
a
ton
of
snow
globey
yeast
particles
hanging
around
that
eventually
settle
out
there
isnt
much
head
but
the
beer
is
excitable
with
a
good
rustle
the
nose
is
fruity
orange
peel
and
some
spice
as
well
as
a
curious
yeast
bordering
on
something
as
funky
as
ommegang
uses
but
having
a
sweeter
vanilla
character
to
throw
things
off
in
any
event
it
has
some
tartness
but
blends
perfectly
with
the
other
fruit
flavors
this
is
a
light
feeling
beer
with
pleasingly
vibrant
carbonation
and
only
a
light
body
it
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
and
am
now
2
for
2
with
beers
from
these
guys
this
was
an
easy
6er
and
one
i
will
buy
again
id
like
to
visit
this
place
i
have
a
feeling
theyve
got
a
real
good
thing
going
odnot
huge
on
this
one
the
best
part
of
a
witbier
is
its
light
body
high
drinkability
and
refreshing
flavors
this
doesnt
hit
directly
on
any
of
the
three
no
wonder
why
i
dont
see
a
ton
of
double
whites
on
the
shelves
o
this
is
a
style
that
may
not
need
the
imperial
treatment
or
maybe
this
just
was
not
executed
as
well
as
it
could
have
been
very
traditional
tasting
witbier
with
extra
booziness
and
a
messy
mouthfeel
not
bad
but
there
are
better
witbiers
out
there
o
im
not
really
a
fan
of
this
one
the
spice
and
alcohol
are
a
bit
much
and
besides
those
two
flavors
everything
else
seemed
muted
the
body
was
decent
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nicely
dry
finish
drinkability
suffered
from
the
blandness
and
funk
i
dont
think
i
want
another
overall
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
would
avoid
it
unless
you
want
the
tick
i
was
excited
to
these
brews
in
a
local
store
and
was
a
bit
let
down
after
all
the
positive
things
id
heard
about
this
brewery
o
lemony
bready
and
sweet
lots
of
fizz
single
finger
head
on
a
murky
pale
golden
body
scattered
lacing
aroma
of
lemon
custard
wheat
pale
malts
and
cream
flavor
is
very
similar
and
creamy
with
lemon
custard
orange
peel
pale
malts
light
body
and
light
to
medium
carbonation
nice
double
wit
very
flavorful
and
the
booze
are
well
hidden
pours
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
there
are
plentiful
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
beer
the
beer
smells
like
a
typical
wheat
beer
i
pick
up
the
wheat
malt
along
with
some
mild
citrus
the
taste
follows
the
nose
but
i
do
catch
those
coriander
notes
in
the
flavor
as
well
theres
a
good
solid
malt
backbone
from
the
wheat
and
barley
malts
theres
some
mild
citrus
flavor
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
clean
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
very
good
beer
its
a
solid
wit
oa
nice
witbier
with
interesting
flavor
refreshing
summer
beer
a
very
impressive
take
on
a
belgian
wit
the
flavors
are
more
intense
and
work
beautifully
together
overall
a
very
good
white
my
first
venture
into
the
double
white
refreshing
and
crip
perfect
for
the
summer
overall
i
know
these
guys
are
serious
about
their
beers
and
this
it
shows
pretty
enjoyable
certainly
a
wit
that
can
get
your
drunk
o
an
interesting
interpretation
of
a
white
ale
high
use
of
bitter
orange
peel
definitely
gave
it
a
more
american
feel
as
well
as
the
bready
character
but
it
is
simple
and
refreshing
dispite
the
higher
abv
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
american
witbiers
available
today
on
the
market
not
a
favorite
style
for
me
but
decently
drinkable
still
a
killer
witbier
and
ill
give
it
due
credit
in
the
overall
score
4
5
definitely
a
nice
witbier
to
be
sure
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
somewhat
different
than
im
used
to
but
the
sixer
i
bought
will
get
put
to
good
use
o
tried
it
on
a
whim
and
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
nice
to
see
someone
played
with
the
style
and
didnt
pump
out
another
tired
witbier
crisp
and
clean
lightbodied
very
drinkable
moderately
high
carbonation
a
solidly
made
wit
that
doesnt
necessarily
stand
out
from
the
many
others
on
the
market
nice
warm
weather
beer
and
good
for
the
right
food
pairing
such
a
great
brewery
with
such
quality
products
poured
a
2
white
head
of
medium
life
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
lots
of
effervescence
it
smells
of
grass
grain
and
malt
and
not
really
of
the
spices
listed
as
ingredients
so
far
this
doesnt
sound
wildly
different
than
one
of
my
bmc
reviews
however
the
taste
and
finish
is
where
this
truly
shines
buttery
malt
orange
and
lemon
peels
the
coriander
they
all
come
through
nicely
followed
by
quite
a
long
finish
featuring
a
tart
citrus
zing
refreshing
invigorating
and
packing
more
punch
than
your
typical
witbier
o
one
of
the
first
witbiers
i
ever
loved
upon
first
sip
easy
to
drink
and
tasty
but
has
a
substantial
presence
to
it
as
far
as
alcohol
and
body
goes
o
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
beer
certain
one
that
i
will
have
again
this
beer
screams
out
to
be
drunk
on
a
warm
summer
evening
pleasant
aroma
nice
flavors
and
slightly
fuller
bodied
than
a
traditional
witbier
overall
not
a
bad
wheat
offering
i
would
buy
this
again
great
summer
beer
a
very
enjoyable
brew
for
this
time
of
year
very
visually
appealing
but
the
sweetness
does
get
a
little
bit
overbearing
this
beer
does
have
plenty
of
good
qualities
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
if
the
mood
struck
me
o
im
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
and
it
actually
one
that
got
me
into
beer
to
begin
with
if
you
want
a
slightly
bigger
taste
than
the
normal
witbier
but
still
want
that
classic
belgian
wheat
beer
taste
this
is
your
beer
it
has
a
really
good
taste
to
it
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
but
i
do
think
the
sweetness
would
prevent
this
from
becoming
a
session
beer
drinkability
and
overall
impression
each
sip
follows
on
easily
from
the
last
and
id
be
happy
to
have
a
second
one
of
these
i
expect
ill
be
seeing
it
again
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
well
made
wit
that
is
a
good
representative
of
the
style
that
said
if
given
a
choice
id
opt
for
the
saint
bernardus
or
the
allagash
but
this
would
nonetheless
be
a
strong
contender

medium

crisp
and
refreshing
on
the
feel
overall
this
is
a
good
wit
not
sure
why
its
a
double
but
what
ever
its
good
a
good
wit
but
id
rather
grab
a
st
bernie
or
allagash
any
day
a
tad
on
the
dry
and
spicy
side
for
me
i
would
have
liked
the
taste
to
be
more
citrus
forward
12
oz
bottle
into
tulip
poured
a
hazy
amber
with
a
thin
and
quickly
falling
head
with
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
with
banana
as
well
as
a
little
citrus
and
coriander
while
a
little
thin
in
the
mouth
it
works
nicely
as
the
prevailing
flavor
is
the
citrus
with
a
slight
alcohol
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
refreshing
and
great
tasting
beer
one
i
would
like
to
try
again
in
the
summer
o
a
nice
slightly
big
white
ale
this
is
quite
refreshing
and
definitely
one
that
i
will
come
back
to
lighter
medium
body
somewhat
higher
carbonation
tingly
and
refreshing
this
drinks
really
nicely
while
im
not
the
biggest
witbier
fan
this
is
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
especially
during
the
warmer
months
overall
this
is
a
real
solid
tasting
and
great
smelling
witbier
as
a
double
it
feels
like
a
big
one
also
but
for
6
6
its
a
little
boozy
i
still
rather
enjoy
this
though
and
would

my
eye
on

a
tasty
beer
i
dont
believe

tried

beers
in
this
style
cheers
pours
cloudyhazy
orange
yellow
with
very
thin
white
head
no
lacing
whatsoever
even
for
unfiltered
there
is
a
lot
of
stuff
floating
around
in
here
scent
is
that
of
lemons
andor
oranges
taste
is
unexpectedly
bitter
citrus
very
oily
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
overall
excellently
crafted
brew
this
one
ranks
among
the
very
best
statesidebrewed
witbiers
its
affordability
and
availability
are
cherries
on
top
get
it
if
you
see
it
undoubtedly
one
of
southamptons
best
o
a
very
well
done
wit
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tasted
the
dusty
quality
really
sets
it
apart
from
the
very
citrus
forward
variations
i
would
really
like
to
try
it
if
they
were
to
throw
some
brett
into
this
beer
o
i
really
love
this
brew
taste
is
exceptional
appearance
is
nice
just
hits
so
well
on
the
palate
really
refreshing
and
not
an
extreme
wheat
taste
like
that
of
hoegarten
very
enjoyable
o
had
this
on
tap
once
before
and
loved
it
was
after
a
russian
imperial
stout
and
a
double
ipa
in
the
bottle
its
slightly
disappointing
for
the
style
id
stick
with
allagash
white
blanche
de
chamblly
or
even
the
wit
that
my
local
rockbottom
has
on
occasion
not
a
favorite
style
taking
that
into
consideration
this
is
a
nice
version
of
the
style
as
noted
above
however
too
much
reliance
on
spices
for
the
flavor
and
nose
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
slightly
darker
color
than
i
expected
the
beer
is
not
transparent
at
all
there
is
a
good
amount
of
haze
in
there
for
sure
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
citrusy
with
some
sweet
grainy
aromas
in
there
also
the
taste
of
the
of
the
beer
gives
off
a
little
bit
of
a
floral
quality
and
some
herbal
citrus
notes
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
pretty
good
they
really
managed
to
concentrate
this
brew
into
a
thicker
double
feel
overall
i
think
this
brew
was
really
enjoyable
and
would
probably
drink
it
again
one
day
serving
type
growler
overall
great
summer
beer
drinks
easy
but
carries
a
ton
a
flavor
d
very
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
id
be
happy
drinking
three
or
four
of
these
by
myself
this
is
one
of
the
better
witbiers
i
have
had
very
refreshing
i
will
have
to
try
more
from
southampton
overall
im
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
constantly
throw
it
in
as
an
extra
in
trades
probably
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
wits
ive
encountered
ill
have
to
see
how
the
fresher
bottle
i
have
in
the
fridge
compares
to
this
one
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
though
not
as
spicy
as
i
would
have
hoped
very
smooth
and
refreshing
a
delicious
hotweather
beer
this
was
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
muggy
evening
overall
i
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
and
it
is
very
highly
drinkable
im
not
sure
i
got
the
whole
double
wit
thing
though
it
tasted
like
just
your
average
single
anyways
maybe
thats
a
good
thing
the
alcohol
was
well
hidden
id
drink
this
again
anytime
thin
white
head
pretty
golden
yellow
color
very
opaque
and
some
yeast
chunks
and
sediment
poor
head
retention
yields
a
vanishing
head
aromatic
belgian
yeast
citrus
and
coriander
pretty
standard
but
nicely
pulled
off
aroma
a
nice
marriage
of
wheat
and
fruity
esters
a
second
sip
reveals
coriander
spice
and
orange
peal
the
finish
is
slightly
more
sticky
and
cloying
then
i
would
like
pretty
nice
product
here
id
indulge
again
even
with
some
of
its
short
comings
good
flavor
and
aroma
win
out
this
very
good
beer
comes
cloudy
with
a
strawlike
color
the
head
is
a
creamy
white
with
alot
of
lacing
the
aroma
of
spice
especially
coriander
on
the
nose
hints
at
the
flavors
you
will
be
tasting
the
creaminess
of
the
beer
is
surprising
considering
it
is
unfiltered
the
coriander
citrus
and
slight
white
peppercorns
flavors
are
refreshing
and
clean
had
it
at
rookies
sports
club
with
the
parmesan
garlic
and
honey
thai
wings
went
very
well
together
overall
a
very
nice
witbeir
very
enjoyable
especially
during
the
summer
months
not
overly
fruity
as
i
find
with
others
of
they
style
great
to
sit
down
with
a
6pack
of
this
at
the
end
of
a
hot
day
o
this
one
didnt
start
off
too
good
for
me
but
i
was
hooked
at
first
sip
the
banana
is
very
nice
in
the
flavor
and
the
spices
never
become
too
overpowering
the
creamy
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bonus
especially
coming
from
the
bottle
d
very
high
for
its
abv
content
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
o
a
very
good
clean
and
refreshing
beer
whites
are
always
one
of
my
favorites
d
very
drinkable
really
smooth
overall
the
flavors
are
all
work
together
and
are
fairly
strong
considering
how
light
the
beer
stays
the
finish
is
also
really
nice
for
a
witbier
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
definitely
a
witbier
and
something
i
will
probably
come
back
to
as
the
summer
comes
in
overall
the
only
knock
i
have
on
this
beer
is
that
it
isnt
very
exciting
i
wasnt
blown
away
but
it
was
good
o
either
ive
gotten
an
extremely
old
bottle
here
or
this
beer
really
missed
the
mark
judging
from
the
grade
im
in
the
minority
here
i
may
try
again
if
given
the
chance
just
to
see
if
my
initial
review
was
influenced
by
a
bad
bottle
otherwise
i
have
to
say
the
overly
sour
flavor
of
this
beer
is
its
downfall
o
nice
beer
id
drink
it
again
pours
from
the
12
oz
bottle
a
cloudy
orangishyellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
dissolves
completely
good
amount
of
carbonation
present
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
haze
i
do
believe
i
see
yeast
chunks
floating
then
settling
at
the
bottom
i
wasnt
aware
that
this
is
bottle
conditioned
aroma
is
a
classic
note
of
citrus
and
spice
1st
sip
is
a
tangy
note
of
orange
lemon
peel
spicy
coriander
and
biscuity
yeast
crisp
and
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
solid
and
firm
with
a
really
nice
sparkle
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
high
even
with
the
higher
alcohol
content
i
could
see
myself
easily
downing
one
after
the
other
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
fact
the
alcohol
is
so
well
hidden
this
could
be
one
of
those
carefuloritmightsneakuponyou
type
of
brews
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
and
i
cant
wait
to
pick
up
more
some
to
drink
now
and
some
to
age
a
bit
for
the
summer
this
is
a
good
beer
which
id
happily
drink
again
o
seems
like
a
decent
alternative
to
the
belowaverage
wits
out
there
nice
flavors
easy
on
the
palate
id
buy
again
to
appeal
to
craft
beer
newbies
who
are
stuck
with
an
orange
slice
on
the
lip
their
blue
labeled
brown
bottle
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
small
twinge
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
being
6
7
in
a
white
beer
like
this
is
strange
but
definitely
welcomed
goes
down
easily
and
refreshingly
making
this
a
good
beer
d
a
nice
session
beer
for
the
right
occasion
but
not
something
i
would
search
out
d
i
would
get
this
again
if
the
occasion
were
right
but
its
not
one
i
would
search
out
or
pick
up
on
a
whim
drinkability
is
moderate
to
low
again
not
a
great
saison
but
good
for
a
stand
by
if
you
have
regular
access
to
it

cheers
overall
i
am
happy
with
this
beer
from
southampton
and
i
think
it
is
one
of
their
better
brews
though
being
a
bit
high
in
abv
for
a
witbier
it
nonetheless
pulls
it
off
and
doesnt
end
up
being
offensive
the
way
you
might
expect
a
double
witbier
to
be
i
would
give
it
a
try
if
this
is
available
to
you
and
witbiers
are
your
thing
d
drinkability
is
moderate
at
first
the
lemon
is
a
deterrent
then
refreshing
but
as
i
near
the
end
of
the
glass
it
kind
of
becomes
a
bit
much
some
more
spices
and
dryness
to
cut
the
lemon
a
bit
would
help
but
it
certainly
is
different
m
d
chalkytangy
feel
overall
abundant
co2
with
an
occasional
hint
of
ethanol
d
man
i
wouldnt
even
consider
getting
this
again
i
enjoy
witbiers
when
they
are
around
45
percent
but
once
doubled
it
really
loses
flavor
it
drank
almost
like
a
malt
liquor
avoid
d
i
could
pop
a
few
of
these
for
sure
i
use
to
hate
this
style
to
me
witbiers
often
have
sort
of
a
rotten
fruit
aftertaste
that
i
often
find
unpleasant
well
there
was
nothing
foul
about
this
one
this
is
probably
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
very
cloudy
in
appearance
the
head
fades
away
pretty
quickly
lots
of
carbonation
and
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
bottle
brought
back
from
my
trip
in
new
york
pours
a
very
cloudy
pale
orange
colour
with
thick
white
head
nice
head
retention
and
lacing
smells
of
coriander
lots
of
lemon
some
orange
and
wheat
nice
tart
lemon
flavour
with
sweetness
very
smooth
mouthfeel
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
witbiers
that
ive
had
solid
allaround
beer
had
this
at
first
on
a
scorching
day
on
the
golf
course
several
years
before
i
was
a
craft
fan
pushed
me
in
that
direction
hazy
pour
nice
fluffy
white
head
smelled
of
wheat
and
oranges
and
spices
tastes
of
yeast
wheat
oranges
and
coriander
very
yeasty
pleasant
mouthfeel
leaves
you
wanting
more
in
the
right
atmosphere
one
could
enjoy
many
of
these
from
southampton
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
strong
on
the
coriander
but
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
orange
peel
still
it
has
one
of
the
heaviest
coriander
aromas
of
any
double
white
i
can
remember
the
flavor
is
more
balanced
i
get
a
good
dose
of
wheat
and
coriander
but
i
also
get
some
great
juicy
orange
notes
the
alcohol
is
also
fairly
detectable
in
the
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
smells
like
orange
rind
and
lemon
with
a
little
pepper
and
coriander
and
tastes
like
wonderfully
juicy
citrus
and
banana
with
some
lovely
spicy
phenols
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
silky
skirting
sticky
effervescent
with
great
carbonation
and
i
was
shocked
to
see
how
well
it
hid
the
abv
really
good
example
of
the
style
really
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
well
done
witbier
that
is
very
refreshing
id
definitely
have
it
again
serving
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
d
very
nice
and
a
really
good
drink
d
super
easy
drinker
great
wit
d
one
could
have
a
few
of
these
nice
session
beer
though
i
did
not
look
at
the
abv
it
is
a
bit
sour
which
i
usually
like
but
there
isnt
much
depth
to
it
so
im
not
crazy
about
it
the
palate
is
well
carbonated
tart
and
dry
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
a
little
too
lemony
for
me
excellent
witbier
nice
color
smells
ok
but
could
be
better
taste
of
lemon
and
orange
more
so
the
orange
mouthful
has
a
good
feeling
and
very
smooth
smooth
feeling
leads
to
very
good
drinkablity
and
a
good
time
drinking
with
friends
on
any
occasion
im
not
a
big
wheat
beer
guy
but
this
is
pretty
quality
stuff
i
can
see
why
it
is
so
popular
with
fans
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
crisp
just
right
drinkability
is
good
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
quite
drinkable
and
a
great
americanized
version
of
the
style
the
extra
size
and
bold
flavors
make
drinking
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
classic
examples
but
in
a
good
way
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
lemon
zest
and
coriander
in
the
taste
a
mixture
of
sweet
orange
and
lemon
zest
and
a
spicy
cinnamon
flavor
a
smooth
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
cinnamon
on
the
tongue
and
orange
citrus
in
the
aftertaste
a
bit
sweet
but
big
citrus
and
nice
cinnamon
balance
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
the
nose
brings
a
good
dose
of
citrus
stone
fruits
wheat
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
lays
off
a
bit
with
just
some
mild
lemon
and
peaches
as
well
as
a
bit
of
wheat
nice
full
feel
for
a
fairly
lightflavored
brew
good
carbonation
drinks
really
nicely
and
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
d
this
was
a
mellow
beer
that
had
a
nice
sent
and
taste
it
had
a
good
body
too
and
hid
the
alcohol
well
so
it
was
easy
to
drink
there
was
nothing
too
unique
or
bold
about
it
but
it
was
a
solid
witbier
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
for
a
long
time
it
lived
up
to
its
expectations
i
really
like
this
one
final
thoughts
absolutely
exceptinal
beer
you
can
tell
a
lot
went
into
getting
this
recipe
just
right
two
thumbs
up
d
easy
to
drink
very
smooth
beer
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
when
ever
where
ever
dgreat
drinkablity
this
would
be
a
good
summer
ale
with
is
refreshing
citrus
flavors
overall
a
great
beer
after
the
samuel
adams
double
white
this
was
difficult
to
finish
the
massive
flavor
and
carbonation
of
these
doubleimperial
whites
make
it
pretty
hard
to
have
even
a
couple
in
one
sitting
i
could
drink
it
all
night
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
orange
peel
and
sweet
coriander
rule
the
nose
the
flavor
is
lemony
zesty
and
just
enough
spice
the
beer
is
sweet
and
has
a
nice
balance
of
spice
a
solid
witbeer
very
drinkable
beer
is
kind
of
sweet
kind
of
citrus
lots
of
lemon
flavors
late
finishes
a
little
dry
which
is
good
for
this
style
of
beer
its
pretty
drinkable
reminds
me
a
lot
of
st
b
wit
which
is
quite
good
its
moderately
carbonated
in
the
mouth
giving
it
a
bright
feel
to
it
its
nice
for
an
american
take
on
the
witbier
a
little
high
in
abv
but
i
guess
thats
why
its
a
double
nice
still
obviously
masterfully
brewed
as
are
all
of
southamptons
beers
ive
tried
if
you
want
a
witbier
with
more
sock
than
usual
go
for
it
this
was
my
first
venture
into
the
southhampton
beer
line
i
was
a
bit
worried
it
would
be
like
blue
moon
this
is
so
far
beyond
blue
moon
its
crazy
from
the
first
chug
you
can
taste
the
citrus
and
the
spice
coriander
then
i
know
its
6
7
alc
but
you
do
not
taste
the
alch
at
all
the
after
taste
is
the
same
as
the
first
taste
this
beer
is
as
good
a
white
as
you
can
get
unreal
a
white
worth
skipping
d
a
pretty
solid
beer
some
nice
bananas
and
fruit
in
the
smell
and
taste
had
it
many
times
and
would
buy
it
again
draft
version
is
quite
good
as
well
in
conclusion
i
think
is
a
good
beer
and
is
well
worth
the
try
the
price
was
less
than
a
sixpack
of
the
blue
moon
belgian
white
and
i
think
is
far
superior
so
if
you
like
the
blue
moon
try
this
and
i
pretty
sure
you
will
not
be
disappointed
d
there
is
no
doubt
you
have
a
glass
or
two
or
three
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
virtually
no
bitter
taste
this
is
your
spring
water
on
a
hot
day
a
really
solid
wit
beer
very
fruity
doesnt
dry
as
much
as
other
wits
but
very
good
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
on
this
beer
they
went
with
a
lighter
body
than
i
would
have
preffered
i
would
have
liked
a
bigger
wheatier
mouthfeel
but
this
is
a
minor
complaint
in
such
a
great
beer
and
good
news
im
starting
to
see
this
on
tap
in
more
places
in
the
end
this
is
a
worthy
wit
but
it
is
far
better
ontap
in
my
experience
will
have
to
review
it
in
that
form
when
i
get
the
chance
overall
southamptons
double
white
ale
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
witbier
it
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
qualities
rather
everything
ties
together
nicely
although
the
smell
is
a
tad
below
what
i
expected
the
rest
of
characteristics
make
up
for
it
a
solid
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
like
today
100
degrees
here
in
nj
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
very
good
retention
before
settling
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
the
weakest
part
of
this
beer
it
is
not
bad
but
really
weak
and
understated
i
do
pick
up
some
wheat
and
lemon
maybe
a
little
yeast
as
well
this
is
a
chewy
thicker
witbier
a
lot
of
malt
is
in
this
beer
solid
malt
foundation
giving
a
nice
wheat
flavor
the
added
spices
just
playing
a
minor
supporting
role
the
coriander
and
lemon
are
there
but
i
had
to
go
searching
for
them
i
was
not
complaining
as
some
wits
really
go
overboard
with
all
the
stuff
brewers
throw
into
their
beers
bigger
in
body
than
other
wits
a
bit
chewy
and
has
less
carbonation
then
most
it
could
of
used
a
little
bit
more
lift
being
a
bigger
beer
it
losses
some
of
the
drinkability
aspects
of
the
style
i
enjoyed
the
ability
to
enjoy
the
malt
more
instead
of
being
overpowered
by
some
added
spice
drinkability
saw
this
in
times
5
beers
for
the
summer
list
earlier
today
and
when
i
ran
across
this
beer
at
a
store
that
offered
mixed
sixers
i
grabbed
a
bottle
a
summer
beer
is
a
great
description
and
this
would
be
good
for
a
hot
day
not
the
most
flavorful
wheat
beer
out
there
but
still
a
pleasant
brew
do
belgian
wits
are
one
of
my
favorite
summertime
beer
styles
and
southampton
has
made
a
great
one
with
their
double
white
clean
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
cheers
f
finishes
semi
bitter
with
more
citrus
orange
peel
lemongrass
etc
light
spices
lingering
that
build
a
bit
towards
the
finish
theres
also
a
slight
tanginess
as
well
it
dries
a
bit
but
still
leaves
a
lingering
malty
sweetness
this
is
essentially
the
model
of
an
american
witbier
but
doesnt
bombard
with
hops
like
some
americanized
beers
do
d
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
and
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
even
when
considering
its
higher
alcohol
content
as
compared
to
typical
witbiers
hoegaarden
was
my
first
wit
choice
but
this
one
just
took
over
the
number
one
spot
note
this
review
is
from
the
2nd
out
of
2
from
the
same
6
pack
the
1st
one
was
defiantly
bad
there
was
no
head
no
lacing
transparent
yellow
the
great
smell
was
still
there
but
the
flavor
was
flat
a
heavily
watered
down
i
poured
a
second
and
redid
my
review
for
a
stronger
beer
this
is
wetting
to
the
palate
and
crisp
this
is
a
great
alternative
to
the
relatively
typically
light
bodied
belgian
wits
another
mix
a
six
find
this
beer
looks
really
good
has
a
great
cloudy
orange
color
to
it
with
a
nice
big
white
head
smell
is
a
bit
off
at
first
has
a
very
pungent
sour
citrus
aroma
to
it
i
hope
it
isnt
a
bad
batch
or
an
old
beer
because
the
taste
is
a
bit
off
to
maybe
its
just
a
stronger
witbier
than
im
used
to
it
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
average
i
wish
i
could
find
it
on
draft
and
give
it
another
review
incase
this
one
is
bad
drinknability
i
could
really
drink
this
beer
all
day
in
the
summer
nice
refreshing
flavors
and
a
pretty
light
and
crisp
body
relatively
clean
finish
and
moderate
abv
really
allows
for
several
to
be
drank
down
in
a
night
or
afternoon
or
morning
whatever
your
preference
may
be
easily
drinkable
and
they
go
down
even
smoother
nice
job
phil
very
nice
ill
definitely
pick
this
up
again
if
i
see
it
d
the
elevated
abv
takes
this
out
of
session
range
but
this
is
so
tasty
and
refreshing
it
would
be
easy
to
have
too
many
of
these
one
of
the
better
bargains
out
there
i
really
like
this
one
great
mouthfeel
not
too
heavy
highly
drinkable
a
great
brew
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
little
skim
head
and
a
slight
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
as
the
backbone
with
notes
of
citrus
lemons
mainly
and
clove
over
the
top
taste
has
a
nice
crisp
wheat
taste
with
hints
of
lemon
corriander
and
clove
mixed
in
with
it
well
balanced
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
and
is
crisp
in
feel
the
drinkability
is
good
on
this
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
wanting
more
and
feeling
satisfied
crisp
and
clean
a
nice
summer
beer
clean
topaz
color
and
a
pure
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
classic
banana
nose
with
hints
of
nuts
and
spice
bright
flavors
of
candied
citrus
and
maple
with
a
sweet
and
lingering
but
refreshing
finish
to
me
this
seems
like
an
easy
style
to
do
ok
but
not
get
quite
right
these
guys
seem
to
nail
it
poured
from
a
bottle
into
my
dfh
signature
glass
southampton
double
white
pours
a
lovely
straw
color
though
with
a
disappointingly
small
head
and
not
much
lace
left
behind
this
may
be
in
part
due
to
a
bit
of
a
flimsy
pour
by
me
though
so
i
wont
drop
it
all
the
way
to
a
3
the
nose
is
too
subdued
but
whats
there
is
dominated
by
wheat
with
some
citrus
notes
lurking
in
the
background
the
first
few
sips
are
a
letdown
theres
barely
any
coriander
or
citrus
presence
at
all
and
sh
double
white
tastes
a
bit
watered
down
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
a
few
months
ago
and
remember
loving
it
so
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
sixer
from
a
bad
batch
or
what
the
deal
is
im
gonna
have
to
come
back
to
this
one
somewhere
down
there
road
the
beer
is
a
bit
on
the
low
end
of
the
carbonation
scale
for
the
style
but
i
find
myself
appreciating
that
and
its
got
a
certain
creamy
quality
to
it
that
im
digging
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
makes
me
wish
even
more
that
the
taste
was
up
to
par
southampton
went
big
for
a
white
ale
and
in
some
regards
pulled
it
off
well
theres
no
alcohol
presence
whatsoever
and
as
mentioned
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
i
wish
it
were
crisper
the
wheat
flavors
seem
to
overpower
everything
else
early
on
and
the
rest
of
the
flavor
profile
never
seems
to
recover
still
a
nice
beer
for
warmer
weather
and
worth
a
shot
overall
this
really
is
quite
an
excellent
and
unique
witbier
i
have
to
agree
with
a
previous
reviewer
who
felt
this
was
like
no
other
witbier
he
has
tried
before
i
find
this
to
be
easily
sessionable
cant
wait
to
buy
it
again
a
great
wit
pours
a
cloudy
very
pale
yellow
not
much
head
nice
aroma
of
citrus
and
wheat
very
inviting
taste
doesnt
fail
very
nice
notes
of
orange
and
other
citrus
balanced
by
the
malty
bready
wheat
this
is
a
great
summer
thirst
quencher
a
great
wit
and
goes
to
the
top
of
my
favorites
for
this
style
i
think
the
double
for
this
brew
gives
it
that
push
to
be
a
great
example
of
the
style
not
watery
like
some
of
this
style
can
be
overall
not
the
best
white
ale
ive
ever
had
but
definitely
really
good
would
recommend
and
will
absolutely
purchase
again
on
tap
at
underground
bluz
after
too
many
ipas
and
stouts
i
needed
some
relief
i
found
it
in
the
double
white
hazy
yellow
small
white
head
great
aroma
lots
of
spice
yeast
and
even
a
touch
of
alcohol
finally
a
fullflavored
wit
maybe
thats
why
its
called
a
double
wit
really
balanced
well
spices
yeast
citrus
light
carbonated
body
all
come
together
really
well
for
the
style
dry
finish
really
good
artificial
sweet
quality
and
prickly
carbonation
along
with
a
tad
of
alcohol
bun
make
me
wonder
why
they
bothered
to
double
this
it
seems
to
contribute
harshness
while
not
adding
much
complexity
or
flavor
i
can
drink
it
but
it
doesnt
offer
much
more
than
any
other
witbier
i
have
to
say
this
is
maybe
one
of
my
favorite
wits
most
ive
had
have
been
a
little
to
much
on
the
citrus
side
this
one
balances
nicely
worth
looking
out
for
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retains
decently
aroma
is
has
some
belgian
fruitiness
upfront
as
well
as
some
spice
a
hint
of
malt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
has
doughy
yeasty
notes
up
front
followed
by
some
fruity
esters
orange
peel
spices
white
pepper
and
coriander
and
some
fusel
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
grainy
but
not
bad
drinkability
is
pretty
good
despite
the
sizeable
alcohol
presence
pretty
good
wit
the
flavors
are
a
bit
more
in
your
face
than
with
an
average
wit
but
thats
what
i
expected
wow
this
is
perhaps
the
best
witbier
i
have
had
an
excellent
sessionable
brew
fantastic
stuff
taste
is
great
an
equally
classifiable
hefeweizen
and
strong
pale
ale
feel
maybe
along
the
lines
of
some
top
of
the
line
tripels
i
dunno
strong
grainy
feel
with
a
peachy
regout
mouldy
at
some
point
never
too
sweet
the
aftertaste
is
a
brilliant
subtle
bitter
feel
reminiscent
of
the
better
belgians
and
to
top
it
a
very
consistent
thickness
to
it
not
your
thirst
quencher
but
good
any
day
any
time
prime
overall
decent
white
certainly
good
enough
that
id
try
it
again
sometime
also
complimented
the
meal
very
nicely
d
very
drinkable
beer
could
easily
pound
this
but
makes
for
a
tasty
sipper
definitely
did
not
notice
the
alcohol
at
all
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
with
more
than
a
finger
of
white
fluffy
foam
the
head
displays
minimal
retension
and
receeds
leaving
spotty
amounts
of
lace
along
the
glass
the
yeasty
aroma
includes
smells
mostly
dominated
by
citrus
more
specifically
lemon
and
orange
taste
is
also
yeasty
but
with
a
tiny
bit
of
spicey
clove
mixed
in
with
the
orange
and
lemon
like
citrus
light
feel
with
this
and
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
quite
drinkable
and
well
made
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
is
a
solid
example
that
i
would
drink
again
overall
drinkability
4
5
a
fuller
more
rounded
version
of
a
belgian
white
very
enjoyable
d
good
in
the
bottle
not
so
good
ontap
jealous
a
little
bit
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
and
spices
taste
is
good
well
balanced
spices
and
citrus
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
good
quality
beer
d
easy
to
drink
and
less
bitterspicysour
than
some
witbiers
i
have
had
the
overall
package
doesnt
quite
compare
to
hoegaarden
or
riverhorses
double
wit
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
them
all
witbiers
that
i
have
had
have
been
close
to
style
and
this
one
would
be
included
in
that
very
drinkable
quite
a
nice
example
of
the
style
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
real
easy
almost
too
easy
the
abv
is
not
noticeable
at
all
overall
this
is
in
my
opinion
and
outstanding
take
on
a
style
that
i
am
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
it
has
a
huge
amount
of
flavor
to
it
but
is
still
a
phenomenally
good
session
brew
i
have
to
take
my
hat
off
to
the
guys
at
southampton
on
this
one
this
is
the
first
of
their
beers
that
ive
tried
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
a
whole
lot
more
drinkability
very
good
a
decent
session
beer
d
a
bit
stronger
than
most
witbiers
but
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
so
far
nice
fresh
malt
flavor
with
bright
coriander
spice
notes
prominent
but
not
ovewhelming
one
of
the
bigger
abvs
for
the
style
yet
frightening
drinkable
thanks
to
blake
for
contributing
this
to
the
bowling
green
ky
ba
gathering
id
love
to
see
this
become
available
in
our
area
d
very
enjoyable
definitely
a
goto
wit
if
it
was
available
in
my
area
d
a
solid
beer
overall
i
dont
have
any
complaints
with
tasty
and
refreshing
with
good
balance
well
crafted
and
deliciously
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
belgiany
with
decent
carbonation
and
some
syrupy
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
wit
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
notes
i
wasnt
sure
how
i
would
like
an
imperial
witbier
i
think
that
kind
of
defeats
the
purpose
of
having
a
nice
light
beer
with
light
citrusy
notes
but
it
actually
works
very
well
if
i
wanted
a
simple
easy
beer
i
wouldnt
have
this
one
however
if
you
like
wheat
beers
and
what
a
better
one
this
is
it
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
with
a
pretty
nonaggressive
pour
theres
a
steady
column
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
center
of
my
sam
adams
glass
color
is
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
slight
hazing
smells
of
banana
bready
yeast
and
a
hint
of
orange
peel
with
slight
hints
of
coriander
lemon
and
bready
yeast
right
off
the
bat
then
a
finish
of
banana
orange
and
coriander
lots
of
carbonation
this
would
be
even
better
when
the
weather
warms
up
i
also
get
a
hint
of
alcohol
on
the
finish
and
some
pepper
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
sweet
has
a
nice
sharp
tartness
and
the
initial
sip
that
quickly
dries
the
mouth
and
turns
a
final
quick
burst
of
citrus
i
am
normally
not
a
huge
fan
of
whites
and
rarely
purchase
them
but
this
one
had
a
decent
complexity
that
i
enjoyed
great
summertime
beer
that
could
be
paired
with
a
nice
salad
or
some
lighter
seafood
far
note
made
my
pee
smell
funny
cheers
drinkability
better
than
blue
moon
but
not
the
best
wit
something
about
an
ugly
odorless
witbier
that
powers
through
crystal
clear
deliciously
married
spice
and
fruit
with
strong
alcohol
and
malt
even
when
battling
palatefrying
mexican
food
strikes
me
as
very
endearing
impressive
beer
that
will
spur
me
on
to
try
more
brews
from
this
brewery
the
mouthfeel
was
all
high
carbonation

a

average
witbier
all
the

has
some

appearnce

and
distinct
negatives
lack
of
carbonation
which
tend
to
cancel
one
another
out
still
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
drinkability
is
damn
close
to
that
of
a
witbier
but
the
fuller
body
and
slightly
greater
complexity
adds
much
more
depth
and
weight
to
the
beer
and
the
slight
bump
in
alcohol
is
perceptible
compared
to
its
standard
counterpart
overall
a
nicely
puttogether
brew
departing
from
its
roots
while
still
remaining
firmly
grounded
nothing

the
departure

always
expect
a
lot
from
ccb
so
this
beer
lets
me
down
its
fairly
harsh
for
a
witbier
it
actually
reminds
me
of
the
harshness
of
many
wits
from
belgium
this
style
should
the
kind
you
want
to
drink
large
amounts
of
all
night
long
with
a
touch
of
light
fruit
mixed
in
very
floral
with
a
light
earthy
tone
to
it
and
a
really
nice
touch
of
coriander
or
orange
peel
way
in
the
back
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
pale
gold
color
with
no
head
the
nose
is
very
muted
lightly
toasted
taste
pale
sweetness
this
wit
beer
has
great
long
lasting
head
delightful
smell
and
very
heavy
citrus
peel
and
coriander
taste
it
is
by
far
the
most
flavor
of
all
the
wit
beers
i
have
ever
had
its
almost
unbearable
every
time
i
think
about
it
i
dislike
it

a

cloudy
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of

white
head
that
slowly

and
left
abundant
lacing
down
the
glass
a
beautiful
beer
and
very
true
to
style
scents
of
honey
yeasty
grainy
wheat
bread
a
perfumelike
aromatic
quality
hints
of
orange
zest
and
slight
sweet
spices
and
light
notes
of
white
pepper
a
pleasant
aroma
that
is
fairly
true
to
style
with
a
bit
more
honey
character
than
is
usual
and
a
bit
less
in
the
way
of
spice
aromas
good
and
true
to
style
but
not
the
best
example
of
a
witbier
aroma
taste
begins
pleasantly
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
a
slight
sour
tang
and
a
nice
orange
zest
and
citrus
presence
this
moves
into
a
more
spicy
middle
with
notes
of
coriander
white
pepper
and
low
levels
of
herbalspicy
hops
joining
a
backbone
of
sweet
malt
bready
malt
and
a
refreshing
tang
finish
is
semidry
with
notes
of
coriander
white
pepper
hints
of
orange
zest
bready
wheat
malt
and
a
slight
sourness
not
intense
at
all
aftertaste
is
coriander
and
white
pepper
with
some
wheat
a
fairly
good
flavor
profile
that
is
nicely
representative
of
the
style
refreshing
with
a
nice
balance
between
malt
spice
and
orange
peel
flavors
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
slight
effervescence
from
moderate
carbonation
extremely
easy
to
drink
as
a
result
and
quite
pleasant
in
feel
very
true
to
style
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
witbier
it
hits
the
style
quite
well
all
categories
and
is
a
refreshing
pleasant
beer
overall
pretty
tasty
but
sweet
and
bit
thick
cloying
could
stand
to
be
dryer
this
is
a
real
interesting
take
on
a
witbier
and
a
real
enjoyable
one
cant
say
ive
had
one
like
this
before
it
might
be
a
new
favorite
of
mine
for
sure
overall
typical
witbier
does
down
like
nothing
and
not
too
much
taste
to
stop
you
from
drinking
it
like
a
mad
man
easy
gentle
fresh
simple
but
enjoyable
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
while
it
is
somewhat
lighter
the
flavor
is
full
and
smooth
without
being
watery
there
is
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
wit
with
grapefruit
why
hasnt
someone
done
this
before
if
they
have
i
have
regrettably
missed
it

one

at

time
maybe
the
most

version
i
have
had
of

well
carbonated
yet
a

of

zesty
and
pulpy
almost

like
this

on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
yeast
ester
and
spice
flavors
with
a
moderate
malt
balance
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium

with
a
smooth
crisp
and
lightly
prickly
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
no
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
witbier
all
around
great
balance
complexity
and
robustness
of
flavors
for
4
8
and
extremely
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
o
while
the
honey
flavor
makes
this
beer
a
little
unique
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
it
makes
the
overall
taste
slightly
sweet
and
not
as
refreshing
compared
to
other
witbiers
it
is
still
very
easy
to
drink
overall
i
love
wit
beers
and
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
delicious
example
of
the
style
it
was
fantastically
refreshing
and
i
could
happily
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
during
summer
from
the
22
oz
bottle
purchased
at
holiday
wine
cellar
in
escondido
so
they
made
a
beer
to
quaff
in
the
summer
you
could
drink
gallons
of
this
stuff
on
a
hot
summer
day
no
competition
at
all
for
the
good
imported
stuff
but
a
nice
version
just
the
same
easy
to
like
and
recommend
on

capones

was
a

its
good
but
not
great
way
too
much
floral

going
on
in
here
for
me
overall
this
is
simply
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
not
bad
in
any
way
but
it
is
not
tasty
enough
to
justify
its
position
so
far
outside
of
style
guidelines
overall
one
of
the
better
beers
i
have
had
of
this
style
i
wish
it
were
a
hot
summer
day
because
this
beer
would
be
just
about
perfect
for
it
o
great
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
and
immensely
drinkable
would
have
again
o
solid
flavored
witbier
that
opens
up
well
this
is
a
seasonal
worth
trying
maybe
not
rushing
to
go
out
and
find
because
it
will
always
be
there
the
next
year
but
definitely
worth
grabbing
if
you
want
a
crisp
and
refreshing
wit
lost
abbey
never
disappoints
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
for
the
style
with
carbonation
feeling
a
little
low
overall
it
was
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
the
look
and
feel
felt
a
little
off
but
flavors
were
pretty
good

is
much
the

with
a
mild

on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink

b
overall
a
light

thats
heavy

look
forward
to
picking
up
more
of
this

a
small
tart
citrus
a
spice
bite
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
and
small
dry
spice
in
the
aftertaste
nice
flavor
but
just
above
average
overall
very
drinkable
well
balanced
fairly
complex
i
think
this
bottle
definitely
improved
with
age
body
is
medium
light
with
active
but
soft
carbonation
feels
very
good
on
the
palate
strong
aroma
is
wheaty
and
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
it
pours
a
lovely
clear
solar
yellow
with
a
thick
if
not
too
persistent
white
head
that
leaves
minimal
lacing
firm
wheaty
flavor
has
a
yeasty
undertone
and
hints
of
citrus
and
grass
body
is
a
little
above
average
especially
for
a
wit
and
the
fizz
is
firm
and
persistent
i
managed
to
get
one
of
the
bottles
with
the
controversial
image
of
an
autodafe
could
this
become
a
collectors
item
nice
inoffensive
witbier
far
from
bold
but
the
grapefruit
rind
adds
a
nice
touch
d
very
delicious
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
enough
witbier
but
probably
not
an
offering
ill
find
in
my
glass
again
t
wheat
upfront
with
some
hay
and
lemon
curd
maybe
a
hint
of
clove
as
well
some
prickly
carbonation
works
well
with
the
flavors
a
pretty
solid
wit
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
this
one
this
beer
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
is
bright
and
vibrant
visibly
effervescent
the
smell
as
i
poured
the
glass
was
quintessential
belgian
yeast
taste
was
light
and
bright
the
font
is
a
little
grassy
but
finishes
nice
and
dry
this
beer
is
so
easy
drinking
it
is
quite
the
session
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
day
as
far
as
witbier
are
concerned
this
is
a
lot
cleaner
tasting
that
most
imports
all
in
all
another
winner
from
the
lost
abbey
750ml
bottle
and
pours
cloudy
and
smells
like
lemon
and
like
clove
the
layer
of
tastes
are
as
follows
lemon
coriander
clove
there
is
a
grainy
wheat
feeling
in
the
finish
of
the
beer
very
nice
carbonation
and
very
clean
and
light
finish
of
the
beer
decent
for
a
wit
but
nothing
amazing
the
wit
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
yellow
colored
brew
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
smell
is
citrusy
and
floral
theres
some
spicy
notes
too
in
there
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
much
like
any
other
wit
out
there
there
some
grainy
wheat
and
citrus
with
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
in
there
not
an
overly
exciting
brew
glad
i
had
it
but
i
wont
need
to
have
again
o
not
real
impressed
i
think
its
an
over
priced
over
hyped
version
of
hoegaarden
i
dont
think
i
will
purchase
this
again
low
abv
and
good
carbonation
make
this
an
easy
beer
to
drink
its
quite
refreshing
however
the
honey
was
a
bit
much
so
im
not
sure
that
i
would
have
enjoyed
much
more
than
a
taste
overall
im
not
sure
if
the
odd
bitterness
here
is
coming
from
the
hops
or
from
some
kind
of
spice
but
its
really
quite
distracting
from
the
otherwise
nice
flavors
overall
its
an
ok
wit
in
a
really
cool
bottle
i
might
be
tempted
to
pick
it
up
once
in
awhile
if
it
wasnt
for
the
10
00
pricetag
for
the
750
overall
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
overall
the
flavors
are
mild
but
they
are
good
and
the
beer
is
refreshing
id
have
it
again
if
it
were
available
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
o
a
decent
brew
nothing
special
i
would
have
expected
more
from
lost
abbey
thanks
to
resi
for
sending
this
beer
poured
from
a
brown
25
4
oz
bottle
has
a
very
cloudty
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
some
spices
taste
is
good
citrus
spice
a
touch
sour
at
the
finish
clean
and
refreshing
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
beer
d
i
like
it
but
at
8
50
a
corked
750ml
not
wort
its
weight
in
beer
the
mouth
is
a
little
on
the
spritzy
side
to
start
out
but
mellows
as
i
continue
to
sip
mild
citrus
flavors
meld
with
a
green
earthy
flavor
light
yeast
on
the
back
end
this
was
good
but
far
short
of
great
something
about
it
made
me
wish
i
would
have
split
this
with
some
friends
rather
than
try
to
tackle
the
big
bottle
myself
cool
label
though
another
let
down
from
lost
abbey
i
have
said
that
a
lot
lately
though
imo
this
is
one
of
the
most
over
rated
breweries
i
can
think
of
pours
a
clear
gold
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
yeast
wheat
hops
and
a
hint
of
spice
fits
the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
wheat
slight
yeast
slight
hop
hint
of
citrus
lemon
and
hint
of
spice
clove
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
d
very
good
for
the
style
and
not
a
bad
beer
all
around
theres
something
about
it
that
doesnt
make
me
love
it
though
hard
to
pinpoint
maybe
the
aftertaste
darn
good
though
blah
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
the
lemon
aspect
is
a
bit
oily
and
clingy
inside
the
mouth
that
lasts
this
would
make
for
an
excellent
summertime
brew
poured
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
finger
worth
of
head
and
left
some
good
lacing
sticking
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
pretty
big
on
citrus
and
yeast
character
but
also
had
bready
spice
honey
notes
to
add
to
the
nose
the
taste
was
also
pretty
citrusy
but
the
spice
was
a
little
bit
more
mellow
on
the
palate
alongside
some
yeasty
bready
and
honey
like
accents
the
brew
was
medium
in
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
which
had
a
sweet
citrusy
wheaty
and
slight
crisp
finish
it
drank
very
good
and
was
really
refreashing
while
grubbing
down
on
some
pizza
witches
wit
is
a
pretty
solid
wit
beer
and
has
been
tasty
the
few
times
ive
tried
it
d
this
was
sessionable
for
sure
at
4
8
abv
the
lost
abbey
continues
to
impress
me
taste
is
bready
and
yeasty
not
really
and
fruity
at
all
mouthfel
is
thick
and
rich
overall
a
decent
beer
thats
easy
drinking
d
this
beer
represents
a
very
strong
effort
to
capture
an
idealized
belgianstyle
withardly
unique
nor
extreme
but
classic
in
fact
it
reminds
of
one
of
the
greats
of
the
stylest
bernardus
witas
much
as
any
other
bottled
american
wit
and
blows
away
those
few
other
west
coast
renditions
that
actually
make
it
into
the
bottle
such
a
comparison
is
not
given
here
lightly
while
it
is
remarkable
that
this
beer
is
a
san
diego
rendition
of
the
style
no
handicap
is
necessary
to
compare
it
to
the
best
around
witches
wit
has
a
nice
bold
yellow
golden
hazy
tannish
look
to
it
with
a
bright
white
head
that
becomes
a
cap
and
then
stays
no
clingys
though
the
smell
is
quite
large
with
lemon
wheat
some
haygrass
and
some
clove
the
taste
is
quite
citrusy
with
the
wheat
coming
in
second
clove
is
a
afterthought
somewhat
of
a
small
bubblegum
presence
when
warmed
pale
malt
off
to
the
side
as
well
a
bit
above
light
bodied
and
a
bit
fuller
than
your
average
wit
the
carb
is
nice
and
amped
up
and
a
sharp
and
short
prick
on
the
tounge
i
really
enjoyed
this
wit
for
what
it
was
just
another
witbier
in
a
sea
of
em
in
the
style
drank
my
pint
with
ease
enjoyable
and
forgettable
at
the
same
time
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
before
but
from
different
breweries
over
the
years
pretty
cut
and
dry
drinkability
an
above
average
witbier
that
at
times
takes
on
saison
characteristics
i
appreciate
the
multiple
layers
in
this
beer
that
being
said
i
am
not
sure
i
would
fork
over
the
high
price
to
get
another
drinkability
is
just
ok
this
would
be
an
ok
beer
at
7
a
six
pack
but
at
9
for
a
750
ml
bottle
im
feeling
cheated
a
wit
thats
all
over
the
place
but
after
a
rough
start
enjoyable
enough
to
barely
recommend
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
more
depth
than
your
typical
wit
i
would
go
back
to
this
beer
again
and
again
outstanding
spices
meld
with
tangy
wheat
and
belgian
funk
in
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
color
is
a
hazy
straw
and
carbonation
is
nice
and
brisk
perhaps
3v
smell
is
of
citrus
and
orange
and
citrus
flavors
are
balanced
by
a
noticeable
hop
bitterness
and
not
quite
enough
belgian
yeast
character
the
sweet
spices
accentuate
the
residual
sugar
to
make
the
beer
slightly
too
sweet
but
these
are
quibbles
one
only
notices
in
beers
that
are
close
to
glory
as
witchs
wit
d
just
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
glass
honey
instead
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
doesnt
appeal
to
me
that
much
urine
yellow
in
color
but
it
has
that
glowing
effect
probably
from
the
cloudy
body
head
retention
is
okay
but
i
was
most
impressed
with
the
rings
of
lacing
i
was
getting
this
is
a
witbier
the
has
some
lemon
sweetness
to
it
and
ground
corinador
which
while
still
brings
some
spice
isnt
too
much
but
rather
rounded
in
the
mouthfeel
a
light
bite
of
carbonation
from
the
beer
comes
along
with
a
semicreamy
feel
to
summarize
this
beer
a
very
respectable
witbier
overall
great
refreshing
beer
that
will
plan
on
coming
back
for
a
growler
fill
for
great
for
summer
d
an
unusual
and
cool
beer
unlike
the
other
witbiers
i
have
had
one
small
serving
was
plenty
for
me
worth
a
try
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
weak
coriander
and
orange
peel
spicing
it
has
a
thin
citrus
feel
with
a
light
to
mild
yeast
fruitiness
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
rather
bland
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
the
spicing
is
weak
as
is
the
yeast
character
its
watery
and
not
very
complex
the
mouthfeel
is
above
average
its
a
low
bodied
beer
with
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
weakest
offering
from
lost
abbey
its
an
easy
drinker
but
a
forgettable
wit
fine
drinkable
witbeer
though
hoegaarden
has
nothing
to
fear
d
the
low
abv
helps
this
beer
go
down
quick
very
easy
to
session
with
the
flavor
lacks
the
traditional
wit
spiciness
but
is
still
quite
pleasant
a
nice
pickup
d
super
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
average
for
a
beer
under
5
but
still
feel
like
i
should
give
it
props
for
being
so
darn
refreshing
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
in
that
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
bready
yeast
citrus
flavor
and
subtle
spice
the
peppery
zesty
spice
is
prominent
up
front
with
lots
of
clove
and
corriander
light
crsip
citrus
fruit
especially
lemon
and
orange
peel
with
a
touch
of
honey
that
adds
a
nice
sweet
element
this
helps
balance
the
spiceiness
and
subtle
bitterness
from
the
hops
pretty
quaffable
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
bottle
at
the
brewery
hazy
blonde
with
a
big
white
head
floral
yeasty
spice
and
orangegrapefruit
aroma
dry
flavor
with
light
wheat
and
a
slightly
tart
herbal
finish
light
bodied
and
spritzy
nor
really
a
traditional
wit
but
pretty
tasty
and
drinkable
pours
a
glowing
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
smells
like
you
expect
a
belgian
wit
to
smell
with
spices
and
malt
being
the
predominant
flavor
taste
is
corriander
and
orange
with
a
finish
of
lemon
i
dont
detect
any
honey
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
even
though
the
bottle
says
it
contains
honey
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
i
could
drink
several
of
them
but
not
the
best
beer
of
this
style
i
have
ever
had
i
always
struggle
with
knowing
for
sure
if
the
portabbey
beers
live
up
to
the
reputation
of
their
brewer
in
this
case
im
very
pleased
with
the
results
drinkability
for
the
abv
its
actually
a
bit
slower
than
id
imagine
but
still
very
quaffable
in
this
summer
heat
served
this
relatively
cool
too
and
was
very
refreshed
10
bucks
would
be
steep
for
this
but
on
sale
it
was
a
great
bottle
to
add
to
the
collection
and
a
very
refreshing
summer
wit
d
quite
a
good
witbier
not
sure
its
worth
lost
abbeys
usual
premium
prices
but
id
get
more
of
this
if
it
were
a
reasonable
price
personally
i
dont
understand
why
a
wit
would
be
in
any
bottle
too
large
to
pour
it
all
into
the
glass
at
once
since
the
real
treasure
of
the
style
lies
on
the
bottom
of
the
glass
that
needs
to
be
swirled
in
large
bottles
like
this
you
have
to
wait
to
get
through
too
much
of
it
in
order
to
be
able
to
swirl
and
pour
it
if
you
want
to
enjoy
the
sediment
on
the
bottom
overall
drinkable
but
flavor
is
disjointed
oddly
medicinal
and
almost
flat
tasting
not
my
favorite
very
drinkable
i
like
it
excellent
belgian
white
dthis
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
maybe
a
tad
too
dry
for
a
refreshing
wit
definitely
well
done
for
a
tough
style
but
not
my
favorite
wit
drinkability
is
good
nice
balance
unlike
many
american
interpretations
of
belgian
styles
i
really
think
lost
abbey
has
nailed
this
one
often
the
malt
profile
wont
be
quite
right
or
the
spice
too
obvious
or
the
sweetness
too
high
this
one
scores
well
in
all
regards
blindfolded
id
easily
guess
this
was
from
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
good
stuff
pours
a
lightly
cloudy
dark
amber
orange
pretty
interesting
colour
thin
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
to
a
thin
ring
around
the
glass
some
lace
spots
stick
looks
alright
smell
is
neat
some
light
toast
banana
sugary
sweetness
wheat
orange
peel
coriander
some
frutiness
lightly
yeasty
smells
good
taste
is
great
for
a
witbier
very
dry
and
toasty
oats
wheat
banana
spices
coriander
and
orange
pepper
tropical
quite
malty
too
nicely
balanced
really
nice
for
a
witbier
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
insanely
dry
and
toasty
in
the
finish
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
witbiers
but
this
one
is
great
thanks
greg
witchs
wit
is
a
good
witbier
i
cant
say
its
among
lost
abbeys
best
beers
but
its
pretty
good
especially
for
a
witbier
its
a
little
unique
in
that
it
features
a
rather
prominent
sweet
honey
flavor
i
like
that
i
wouldnt
say
that
makes
it
out
of
line
for
the
style
but
it
is
somewhat
novel
in
that
respect
the
look
and
the
nose
could
use
a
little
work
theyre
above
average
but
could
be
better
overall
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
who
wouldve
thunk
it
lost
abbey
makes
good
beer
despite
the
fact
that
tomme
arthur
and
crew
may
not
be
perfect
they
still
make
damn
good
beer
more
often
than
not
this
ones
definitely
worth
checking
out
over
all
a
good
witbier
at
10
dollars
a
bottle
its
a
bit
overpriced
for
the
actual
quality
would
much
rather
buy
a
six
pack
of
southampton
or
white
rascal
label
on
the
bottle
is
awesome
though
prolly
one
of
the
coolest
beer
labels
ive
seen
super
drinkable
would
be
nice
in
a
12pack
a
great
summer
brew
highly
recommend
this
one
the
fact
that
the
bottles
arent
dated
doesnt
help
maybe
this
bottle
wasnt
fresh
enough
fairly
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
on
a
warm
sunny
day
this
is
the
beer
to
turn
someone
on
to
the
wonderful
world
of
craft
beer
drinkability
though
it
could
benefit
from
a
bit
more
crisp
carbonation
it
was
still
an
enjoyable
immensely
refreshing
belgian
wit
given
the
low
strength
of
this
beer
and
the
breadth
of
flavor
id
say
this
is
very
drinkable
im
glad
this
isnt
just
another
witbier
which
helps
justify
the
high
price
would
be
a
good
one
to
pair
with
food
not
your
starter
belgian
white
with
spices
medium
body
drinkable
and
the
body
was
slightly
flat
the
carbonation
there
tingles
over
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
i
can
deal
that
proteus93feb
11
d
the
refreshing
quality
of
this
ale
is
off
the
charts
i
consider
this
one
of
the
best
american
wits
i
have
tasted
a
great
beer
for
quaffing
no
matter
what
the
season
this
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
amber
with
a
1
fingered
white
head
with
some
lacing
the
smell
is
of
mild
citrus
and
some
banana
the
taste
has
a
decent
malt
base
to
it
and
some
nice
flavors
from
the
yeast
i
would
just
hope
for
a
little
more
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
the
carbonation
level
seems
good
a
highly
drinkable
brew
overall
not
bad
but
definitely
needs
more
coriander

this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
its
a
matter
of
whether
or
not
youre
a
fan
of
the
brew
i
could
have
definitely
done
without
the
honey
but
i
did
like
the
lightly
citric
aspect
the
spices
were
nice
as
were
the
fruit
peels
overall
fairly
tasty
and
this
would
be
a
pretty
refreshing
brew
on
a
hot
summers
day
too
bad
im
an
idiot
and
its

outside
thanks
matt
d
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
glad
i
got
a
bottle
on
sale
for
7
imo
a
wit
is
not
worth
12
for
a
750
at
that
price
it
was
ok
but
anything
higher
makes
other
beers
more
tempting
a
good
interpretation
of
a
witbier
only
down
side
is
its
very
expensive
and
imo
not
worth
the
money
d
refreshing
soft
brew
that
met
my
expectations
light
body
not
a
great
deal
of
carbonation
not
bad
but
seems
to
lack
character
sure
id
want
to
considereing
the
thiness
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
ale
with
a
small
pure
white
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
some
pretty
good

aroma
is
sweet
and
somewhat
cloying
taste
is
also
way
too
sweet
for
the
style
with
honey
taking
too
much
place
in
the
flavor
profile
wheat
malt
and
spices
are
very
subtle
body
is
quite
full
with
average
carbonation
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
the
most
disapointing
offering
from
this
usually
fine
brewery
thanks
for
picking
up
dr

the

no

i
can
have
this
as
my
staple
above
average
mouthfeel
despite
my
frustration
the
beer
in
this
form
still
delivers
much
of
what
i
loved
about
the
tap
witchs
wit
and
while
im
sad
to
say
im
glad
i
only
had
the
one
bottle
if
this
is
the
only
form
you
can
find
it
in
i
suggest
you
do
so
it
stills
has
its
merits
and
hopefully
itll
be
instructive
to
compare
next
year
if
they
can
do
something
about
the
conspicuous
lack
of
bubbles
i
doubted
lost
abbey
could
make
a
light
beer
without
overloading
it
i
was
wrong

all

a

i
appreciate
the

but
the
carbonation
issue
needs
some
work
two
tons
of
smooth
in
the
mouthfeel
department
not
too
insubstantial
so
as
to
be
simple
my
first
thought
was
that
this
was
a
spiceforward
take
on
the
wit
but
the
honey
sweetness
really
opens
up
and
takes
control
not
a
bad
take
not
bad
at
all
golden
yellow
pint
slight
haze
with
a
compact
head
of

it
wasnt

lively

it
looked
like
a
witbier
all
the
same
vague
spice
in
the
nose
bubblegum
with
a
bare
hint
of
coriander
or
clove
body
was
a
little
thin
mellow
and
wheaty
with
more
bubblegum
yeast
ester
flavors
it
didnt
have
the
zippy
carbonation
to
uplift
its
body
but
it
was
still
really
drinkable
overall
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
it
pretty
much

wahoos

sculpins
average
wheat
beer
nothing
special
was
the
variety
pack
skunked
thats
what
i
thought
this
and
the
yellowtail
pale
were
some
of
the
least
appealing
beers
ive
had
from
a
reputable
brewery
in
a
while
however
the
sculpin
in
the
case
was
its
usual
sculpinrific
self
all
this
beer
did
was
make
me
drink
it
as
fast
as
possible
to
get
it
over
with
citrus
as
in
a
tablespoon
of
frozen
orange
juice
conventrate
in
a
gallon
of
water
blue
moon
has
more
flavor
and

granted
maybe
this
style
is
more
susceptible
to
mishandling
on
the
voyage
from
ca
to
pa
than
sculpin
or
it
was
a
bad
batch
only
way
id
try
it
again
would
be
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
on
draft
at
the
brewery
in
a

not
a

of
the

rules
wahoo
drools
refreshing

drinkable
but
a
bit
on

mild
side
and
not
my
typical

choice
nonetheless

the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
grain
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink

with
loads
of

o
very
well
put
together
brew
all
the
typical
flavors
are
represented
have
to
say
it
has
less
spice
then
most
of
the
witbiers
ive
had
but
their
absence
is
not
missed
here
this
is
my
third
ballast
point
brew
and
i
have
to
say
theyve
done
a
great
job
and
are
def
becoming
one
of
my
favs
overall
pretty
interesting
and
thoughtprovoking
brew
o
a
very
drinkable
wheat
more
than
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
night
like
the
bottle
says
light
and
refreshing
overall
i
expected
more
from
this
fantastic
brewer
its
very
drinkable
and
would
be
great
during
the
warmer
weather
but
the
flavours
are
fairly
boring
and
it
doesnt
have
many
features
that
would
leave
me
seeking
it
out
again
i
would
definitely
drink
this
if
it
was
summer
and
i
wanted
a
good
session
beer
overall
its
not
something
that
im
going
to
be
craving
but
its
pretty
decent
belgian
style
wheat
has
the
tart
acidity
on
the
tongue
but
not
a
whole
lot
else
not
a
lot
of
yeast
or
spice
flavour
okay
but
not
really
belgian
would
make
a
good
session
beer
and
pretty
good
for
a
light
4
beer
but
not
a
great
representation
this
is
a
little
disappointing
overall
its
a
little
winey
and
has
little
in
the
way
of
substance
its
one
dimensional
and
is
lacking
some
of
the
nuances
one
would
expect
in
a
belgian
beer
o
a
refreshing
easy
to
drink
witbier
nothing
mindblowing
but
id
certainly
drink
another
not
overpowering
but
adequate
good
mix
of
flavors
to
keep
it
intersting
throughout
this
is
a
pretty
safe
wheat
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
though
in
saying
this
nothing
is
offensive
either
cloudy
leon
yellow
with
a
white
cap
that
fell
quickly
to
a
collar
a
bit
of
spott
lacing
bready
malt
aroma
lemon
citrus
not
much
else
but
its
clean
low
to
medium
bitterness
with
more
lemon
and
bread
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
slightly
dry
decent
texture
a
pretty
basic
wheat
ale
solid
as
far
as
execution
but
nothing
inspired
overall
i
cant
recall
the
last
time
i
tried
this
but
its
a
light
refreshing
and
enjoyable
wit
the
4
abv
is
a
plus
o
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
crazy
going
on
here
just
a
well
made
enjoyable
wheat
ale
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
md
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
but
standin
tow
to
tow
with
any
medium
bodied
ale
out
there
crisp
clean
finish
makes
this
one
really
stand
out
for
a
witbier
honestly
one
of
my
most
cherished
session
beers
and
having
this
brewery
just
a
10
minute
drive
from
my
pad
and
fillin
growlers
for
8
bucks
makes
it
a
regular
in
my
rotation
and
definitely
one
of
my
faves
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
crisp
with
a
lot
of
flavor
for
a
4
0
abv
beverage
well
worth
a
shot
hints
of
banana
cloves
and
an
almost
bubble
gum
like
aroma
peeking
in
through
the
mammoth
wheat
smell
same
held
true
for
the
flavor
with
massive
amounts
of
wheat
present
right
away
that
melded
themselves
into
a
nice
banana
and
clove
profile
that
seemed
to
continue
to
develop
as
it
continued
to
warm
nice
balance
here
with
a
light
to
medium
body
and
smooth
carbonation
left
with
a
slightly
dry
flavor
in
the
mouth
i
went
in
for
a
few
more
sips
leaving
a
nice
bubble
gum
flavor
throughout
in
stickyhot
weather
or
an
afternoon
at
the
ballpark
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
beer
that
would
make
you
say
wahoo
its
not
only
in
those
conditions
that
it
could
be
enjoyed
but
those
are
probably
the
two
situations
in
which
i
personally
would
turn
to
it
and
even
then
i
might
reach
for
a
better
example
if
available
if
not
id
still
be
perfectly
happy
with
this
i
must
say
this
one
is
a
tops
for
me
in
the
witbier
style
well
done
definitely
recommended
after
seeing
this
bottle
and
label
makes
you
wonder
where
gage
roads
got
their
inspiration
and
it
pours
a
very
hazy
pale
yellow
straw
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
one
finger
head
and
sporadic
lacingthe
smell
is
spicy
wheat
and
citrusit
has
a
light
bodied
silky
mouthfeel
and
has
tastes
of
candied
wheatcorriandercitrus
and
finished
with
a
spicy
hop
dryness
and
overall
this
would
be
a
great
summer
session
drop
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
i
was
all
set
to
not
like
this
beer
but
the
taste
came
through
and
bumped
it
up
nicely
its
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
but
id
have
it
again
i
sampled
this
one
on
tap
at
the
ballast
point
brewing
co
home
brew
mart
in
linda
vista
poured
a
clear
pale
whiteish
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
on
top
aromas
of
lemon
light
dough
and
a
hint
of
spice
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
bodied
and
refreshing
with
flavors
of
light
bread
citrus
zest
and
coriander
id
say
this
is
a
better
hefeweizen
than
a
lot
of
beer
claiming
the
style
definitely
not
the
typical
sharp
and
skinny
wit
ill
have
to
try
this
in
the
bottle
its
definitely
great
on
tap
poured
ontap
at
the
brewery
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
an
opaque
milky
yellow
color
with
chunky
wheat
residue
head
the
head
actually
broke
up
into
parts
as
it
floated
along
the
top
of
the
beer
spicy
and
sweet
aroma
with
highlights
of
lemony
scents
the
beer
has
a
bready
taste
with
peppery
and
clove
spiced
characteristics
the
beer
maintains
a
light
body
desspite
the
appearance
smell
and
flavors
it
is
a
bit
acidic
and
the
carbonation
makes
the
finish
sharp
decent
wit
verdict
decently
priced
and
it
needs
to
be
so
you
can
drink
enough
of
it
good
for
warm
weather
and
getting
your
nonbeer
drinking
friends
drunk
worth
trying
o
this
is
a
really
nice
witbier
a
bomber
of
this
would
be
quite
perfect
while
grilling
out
in
the
summer
very
clean
balanced
and
refreshing
d
easy
to
drink
if
you
enjoy
this
style
while
not
my
top
style
i
appreciate
the
quality
of
this
beer
perhaps
the
weakest
offering
from
ballast
point
being
a
cross
between
an
american
unfiltered
wheat
ale
and
a
witbier
it
isnt
bad
just
boring
and
lacklustre
very
smooth
and
drinkable
beer
for
the
price
could
be
a
great
session
beer
nice
for
the
summer
although
i
drank
it
in
the
winter
and
it
was
just
fine
big
22
ounce
offering
pours
like
a
banana
smoothie
deep
clouded
yellow
golden
body
thick
and
creamy
white
head
with
specks
of
yeast
imbedded
in
it
thick
chunks
of
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
aroma
has
mild
hints
of
citrusa
touch
of
bananaclovecoridander
nice
west
coast
style
wheat
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
really
dont
impart
much
bitterness
low
hop
rates
for
sure
flavor
was
fantastic
a
nice
creamy

citricgrassy
wheat
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
bananaclovecitrus
great
carbonation
level
going
on
mouthfeel
is
medium

efferescent
airy
carbonation
really
creates
a
unique
drinking
experience
drinkability
overall
was
quality
a
wheat
chock
full
of
flavor
glad
i
didnt
pass
on
this
little
gem
of
a
session
ale
from
the
west
coast
d
a
low
abv
and
good
carbonation
make
this
a
nice
choice
for
a
warm
summer
night
nothing
about
the
flavor
sticks
out
too
much
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
in
the
end
though
it
doesnt
get
me
excited
it
is
an
enjoyable
and
worthwhile
drink
d
this
beer
as
low
of
a
score
i
gave
it
i
did
kind
of
enjoy
it
a
lot
actually
the
lower
abv
makes
this
a
good
session
beer
the
light
flavors
on
this
beer
made
it
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
this
this
is
why
the
drinkability
is
so
high
for
this
beer
decent
beer
for
the
summer
wouldnt
be
my
go
to
average
d
dull
but
drinkable
my
least
favorite
offering
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
ring
of
white
bottle
mentions
unmalted
wheat
and
oats
i
thought
the
haze
was
from
bottle
conditioningnot
filtering
the
the
beer
but
presumably
the
fine
folks
at
ballast
point
have
more
experience
than
me
the
nose
is
grainy
with
light
citric
notes
and
that
faint
ester
kick
that
identifies
the
wit
in
the
mouth
weve
got
a
lot
if
carbonation
lending
a
slight
metallic
edge
to
orange
peel
and
lemon
backed
by
a
slight
spiciness
some
coriander
was
harmed
in
the
brewing
of
this
beer
the
pale
malt
oats
and
wheat
base
provides
a
smooth
if
overly
thin
drinking
experience
the
low
abv
and
generally
thin
character
do
little
to
piqué
my
interest
but
wahoo
is
a
fine
companion
for
not
thinking
too
much
and
enjoying
a
crisp
refreshing
beverage
on
a
warm
sunny
day
march
or
otherwise
pours
a
nice
golden
color
typical
of
the
style
a
bit
of
haze
and
an
appropriatelysized
white
head
very
nice
smell
with
some
of
the
typical
wheat
scents
coming
through
in
addition
to
a
few
hefe
characteristics
taste
was
nice
with
some
of
the
germantype
yeast
coming
through
again
simple
but
quite
enjoyable
lightbodied
with
ample
carbonation
drinkability
was
very
nice
as
this
was
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
august
day
drinkability
seeing
as
this
one
came
in
a
22oz
bottle
but
goes
down
so
easily
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
out
on
a
warm
day
hands
down
not
really
going
to
test
your
tastebuds
but
the
smoothness
of
it
makes
for
a
pleasurable
drinking
experience
take
a
chance
on
it
seems
like
a
dependable
brew
a
nice
sessionable
wheat
beer
here
kind
of
a
cross
between
a
wit
and
a
hefeweizen
leaning
closer
to
being
a
full
fledged
hefe
than
a
belgian
style
witbier
found
on
topsail
island
north
carolina
pours
a
golden
orange
with
a
thin
lacey
white
head
has
an
aroma
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
tastes
more
like
a
classic
wheat
flavors
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
very
slight
bitter
edge
at
the
very
end
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
october
day
couldve
been
better
couldve
been
worse
drinkability
i
was
all
set
to
expect
an
assertive
west
coast
angle
on
the
style
but
what
i
got
was
a
wit
that
tips
its
hat
to
an
american
wheat
bready
on
the
tongue
with
some
spice
revealing
itself
mid
palate
and
a
subtle
yet
pronounced
orange
citrus
close
that
lingers
briefly
offers
a
good
feel
and
a
carbonation
that
is
good
for
the
body
of
the
beer
which
is
somewhat
fuller
than
typical
for
the
style
decent
drink
limited
only
by
the
general
lack
of
pizazz
in
the
flavor
department
which
does
expand
and
improve
with
some
warming
however
skip
this
one
di
enjoyed
this
beer
alot
it
does
really
grow
on
you
its
great
out
the
door
and
gets
better
as
you
go
i
guess
that
applies
for
a
lot
beers
though
huh
it
was
very
good
i
am
recomending
this
beer
to
my
friends
who
all
drink
coors
light
or
blue
moon
seasonals
i
love
the
idea
of
supporting
a
local
southern
california
brewery
as
well
i
picked
this
up
at
a
bev
mo
pretty
far
from
that
brewery
good
for
ballast
point
keep
up
the
good
work
i
usually
prefer
the
more
creamier
wheat
beers
but
this
was
still
nice
to
try
id
pass
it
over
if
there
were
other
choices
available
d
very
easy
drinking
summer
beer
i
could
session
this
beer
like
mad
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
due
to
its
light
palette
impact
and
very
moderate
abv
i
had
two
seperate
pours
from
this
the
first
looked
something
like
watered
down
orange
juice
with
some
small
debris
seen
floating
the
second
was
cleaner
and
had
a
dark
yellow
appearence
with
some
faint
head
on
the
top
ww
has
scents
of
wheat
belgian
yeast
and
some
subtle
hops
taste
is
the
same
but
i
also
get
some
squeezed
lemon
spicesclove
and
just
a
bit
of
hop
taste
the
feel
was
good
for
a
wit
but
not
as
crisp
as
others
this
was
rather
smooth
drinkability
is
great
with
a
low
abv
but
this
style
is
not
my
bag
overall
the
combination
of
different
elements
make
this
worth
a
try
my
girlfriend
liked
it
especially
for
a
summer
session
beer
compared
to
a
lot
of
american
takes
on
hefeweizen
i
would
rate
it
a
little
higher
but
wahoo
is
simply
outclassed
when
compared
to
many
other
witbiers
drinkability
session
beer
for
the
summertime
heat
a
perfect
beer
for
cinco
de
mayo
to
be
shared
with
mexican
style
food
i
strongly
recommend
wahoo
is
easily
the
most
disappointing
beer
ive
had
from
ballast
point
its
not
impressive
in
any
respect
id
suggest
that
they
remove
this
one
from
the
lineup
if
even
they
didnt
replace
it
their
arsenal
would
be
improved
overall
i
really
like
ballast
point
and
wanted
to
like
this
one
quite
a
bit
but
its
extremely
disappointing
cant
recommend
it
i
liked
this
one
but
didnt
love
it
its
an
easy
drinking
summer
session
beer
for
sure
i
wish
the
aroma
was
duplicated
a
bit
better
in
the
flavour
although
said
flavour
was
still
pretty
good
nonetheless
md
light
bodied
carbonation
is
low
drinkability
is
pretty
good
very
refreshing
overall
nothing
special
but
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
not
an
especially
good
example
of
a
wit
i
think
its
more
of
a
hefe
but
a
solid
brew
its
not
very
impressive
it
borders
on
bmc
only
with
a
bit
more
drinkablility
d
this
is
a
decent
american
example
of
a
witbier
not
what
id
call
brilliant
but
okay
pours
a
light
cloudy
orange
with
middling
lacing
minimal
spices
in
the
nose
like
coriander
and
clove
this
is
a
light
wit
w
not
too
much
going
on
but
passes
clean
and
smooth
with
some
pleasant
spices
and
a
milt
tart
citric
flavor
very
quaffable
and
easygoing
nice
to
have
a
on
hot
day
to
start
off
a
few
rounds
of
beer
drinking
the
drink
is
fluffy
and
medium
in
body
with
lively
carbonation
and
sodapop
drinkability
no
the
taste
isnt
anything
to
write
home
over
but
with
the
brew
clocking
in
at
only
4
abv
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
all
day
m
just
under
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
d
this
could
be
an
easy
standby
beer
to
go
to
when
nothing
else
strikes
your
fancy
i
wouldnt
stick
with
drinking
it
all
night
but
its
good
to
give
your
palate
a
break
once
in
a
while
with
something
that
easily
tastes
good
not
much
coriander
or
orange
in
this
wit
poured
the
bottle
of
wahoo
wheat
into
my
stone
ruination
pint
glass
this
unfiltered
brew
had
a
load
of
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
bottle
identifies
this
as
a
hefeweizen
but
it
is
more
of
a
blegian
white
anyway
the
beer
poured
with
a
2
finger
head
which
quickly
dissipated
it
was
a
nice
golden
cloudy
yellow
the
abv
is
low
enough
that
you
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
without
going
overboard
no
pun
intended
the
wheat
was
a
little
strong
but
still
enjoyable
nothing
else
stands
out
about
this
wit
beer
d
decent
wheat
beer
perhaps
a
little
past
its
prime
still
it
was
pretty
tasty
overall
but
i
wont
be
in
a
big
hurry
to
get
more
at
4
i
suppose
you
could
drink
this
all
day
but
why
adequate
drinkability
i
was
all
set
to
expect
an
assertive
west
coast
angle
on
the
style
but
what
i
got
was
a
wit
that
tips
its
hat
to
an
american
wheat
hohum
appearance
wasnt
great
a
clear
yelloworange
color
with
a
quickfading
fizzy
white
head
little
of
the
hazy
look
at
a
great
witbier
the
smell
was
good
and
true
to
form
clear
crisp
and
clean
plenty
of
wheat
and
yeast
nice
and
spicey
and
cirtusysweet
too
the
taste
was
fairly
average
it
had
all
of
the
ingredients
of
a
good
witbier
plenty
of
wheat
malty
and
bready
flavors
yeast
spices
and
clove
but
not
as
much
as
the
smell
would
indicate
and
sweet
citrus
flavors
more
than
the
smell
lead
on
it
was
enjoyable
enough
but
it
was
just
too
sweet
and
a
bit
watery
the
flavor
wasnt
as
complex
or
as
full
as
i
would
have
liked
the
mediumfizzy
carbonation
and
the
thin
mouthfeel
only
increased
the
feel
that
i
could
drink
this
beer
like
water
all
in
all
it
was
drinkable
but
average
feeling
more
like
a
session
beer
than
something
finely
crafted
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
several
others
in
the
style
that
id
pick
first
not
all
that
happy
with
this
one
pours
cloudy
gold
with
very
little
head
good
spice
and
citrus
in
the
aroma
but
it
is
mixed
with
a
dank
basement
odor
that
is
supposed
to
be
wheat
the
taste
is
very
yeasty
to
the
point
of
souring
the
beer
this
could
be
pretty
good
if
they
would
just
tone
that
down
notes
from
51706
t
d
drinkability
is
good
overall
found
it
to
be
crisp
refreshing
tart
and
easy
enough
going
down
while
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
per
style
it
does
prove
to
be
a
nice
summer
time
picnic
session
beer
that
you
can
pass
the
time
with
pours
a
very
cloudy
light
yelloworange
with
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
somewhat
strong
with
with
the
scents
of
clovebananaand
wheat
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
wheat
flavors
clovebananaand
some
pepper
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
mix
well
abit
thinbut
its
still
a
nice
crisp
summer
beer
d
really
god
drinking
wheat
and
this
is
coming
from
somebody
who
normally
doesnt
drink
much
wheat
ales
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
nose
has
hints
of
lemony
wheat
taste
is
lemony
wheat
with
a
slight
hint
of
pepper
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
goes
across
the
palate
decently
drinkability
is
good
this
would
be
a
very
good
tailgate
beer
the
first
part
of
the
football
season
here
in
the
desert
pours
a
very
pale
golden
with
constantly
streaming
bubbles
that
create
a
tightly
beaded
snow
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
cap
the
bubbles
keep
on
coming
though
pretty
light
in
the
nose
with
some
clean
slightly
lemony
grassy
smells
but
little
spice
and
quite
faint
the
taste
is
a
little
more
developed
and
somewhat
more
assertive
but
still
a
little
soft
still
pleasant
tastes
of
lemon
light
cream
an
herbalness
a
trace
of
minerality
and
some
light
floral
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
and
creamier
rather
than
sharper
tasty
but
a
bit
too
soft
it
needs
a
bit
more
citrus
andor
spice
to
give
it
some
more
crispness
and
bite
drinkability
solid
drinkability
as
its
very
refreshing
and
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
going
back
i
went
through
this
bomber
pretty
quickly
and
would
certainly
buy
a
sixpack
if
i
saw
one
its
better
than
a
lot
of
domestics
but
not
quite
as
good
as
a
lot
of
real
belgians
but
its
hard
to
find
a
good
domestic
wit
these
days
one
going
back
to
at
least
in
my
opinion
mouthfeeldrinkability
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
and
is
only
compounded
by
the
lack
of
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
drinks
pretty
easy
not
quite
on
point
for
a
wit
but
ill
just
guess
they
were
shooting
for
an
american
signature
on
the
style
much
better
wits
out
there
to
be
sure
from
a
22
oz
bottle
this
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
white
head
with
big
bubbles
and
moderate
lacing
nose
of
spices
with
corriander
and
citrus
in
the
front
on
top
of
wheat
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
and
nice
flavors
of
citrus
and
spices
dry
finish
very
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
really
did
not
do
it
for
me
lacked
individuality
and
drinkability
due
to
the
watery
texture
not
exactly
recommended
better
witbiers
out
there
a
nice
easy
drinking
wit
good
summertime
beer
this
brew
had
potential
that
soon
vanishes
seriously
after
pouring
the
last
part
i
walked
away
and
temporarily
forgot
about
it
as
the
orange
and
lemony
what
should
have
been
tart
became
sweet
this
is
not
quite
the
refresher
that
this
style
should
be
this
beer
is
kind
if
boring
and
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
ill
waste
my
money
on
other
wit
beers
reminds
me
of
a
bmc
with
slightly
more
flavor
not
impressed
d
an
above
average
witbier
made
here
buy
ballast
point
and
widely
available
would
buy
again
but
there
are
better
american
wits
made
overall
a
decent
but
not
outstanding
offering
flavor
is
pleasant
and
unified
worth
a
try
this
beer
had
a
nicely
carbonated
cloudy
pour
it
pours
a
nice
light
head
that
retained
through
the
course
of
the
beer
minimal
lacing
involved
it
is
a
very
drinkable
standard
unfiltered
wheat
i
would
like
to
see
a
draft
pour
nice
wheat
and
light
citrus
taste
d
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
overall
this
1
just
didnt
have
enough
of
a
punch
the
flavors
and
feel
were
too
weak
otherwise
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
we
still
have
one
beer
left
in
the
second
unorganizied
invite
which
will
end
tonight
and
then
well
reveal
the
winner
of
this
invite
d
a
nice
beer
for
warm
weather
but
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
a
top
choice
for
a
wheat
beer
all
year
long
a
tad
expensive
at
5
a
bomber
but
worth
it
tasted
of
wheat
some
light
breadiness
with
low
level
citrus
accents
in
the
back
fairly
easygoing
and
thirst
quenching
body
was
a
little
bit
thin
but
passable
this
would
work
outdoors
in
the
summer
its
a
fairly
utilitarian
witbier
pours
quite
cloudy
with
a
dull
biege
color
tinged
with
green
tiny
head
that
leaves
a
faint
collar
the
nose
is
quite
spicy
with
coriander
and
some
other
spices
i
cant
name
although
the
overall
effect
is
dry
and
cinnamonlike
relatively
little
citrus
character
exists
in
the
nose
on
the
palate
brisk
bitterness
and
carbonation
first
off
followed
up
by
a
creamy
coriander
note
and
then
a
light
fresh
fruit
note
the
finish
is
spicy
and
a
tad
yeasty
overall
this
is
a
decent
witbier
albeit
lacking
in
citrus
and
fruitiness
still
its
a
drinkable
and
mildly
thirst
quenching
beer
i
poured
wahoo
wheat
slowly
cautious
of
the
active
and
massive
heads
often
lurking
in
wheat
beers
however
head
was
lacking
so
i
poured
with
more
vigor
and
quickly
created
a
moderate
sized
brillant
white
head
wow
ive
never
seen
a
wheat
beer
with
this
color
before
pale
straw
golden
for
sure
but
wahoo
shows
me
a
bit
of
lemon
too
i
sniff
and
find
cloves
and
a
hint
of
orange
i
drink
and
immediately
notice
a
thinness
to
the
brew
but
at
least
it
is
very
smooth
maybe
from
the
oats
used
in
the
grist
thinness
aside
wahoo
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
bit
of
tartness
in
the
finish
my
lady
friend
liked
it
too
which
of
course
skews
my
perception
of
this
unfiltered
belgian
style
wheat
brew
d
despite
all
of
the
above
it
is
super
drinkable
and
a
good
choice
for
a
lawnmower
beer
i
think
she
paid
3
for
the
22
which
also
makes
it
a
regular
choice
if
it
is
available
after
its
release
from
the
22
ounce
bottle
its
has
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
king
sized
white
creamy
head
that
ever
so
slowly
dissolves
letting
the
lace
from
a
fine
sheet
to
encircle
the
glass
nose
has
a
citrus
like
crispness
sweet
grain
aroma
also
a
hint
of
fruit
pleasing
to
the
nose
and
the
eyes
start
has
a
perfect
grain
presents
somewhat
sweet
a
minimal
bite
at
the
back
top
is
medium
in
its
feel
finish
has
a
crisp
acidity
the
hops
subdued
and
pleasant
dry
aftertaste
a
great
beer
for
those
bygone
days
of
summer
heck
its
a
good
beer
anytime
over
all
this
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
not
my
favorite
not
my
favorite
ballast
point
offering
ahhh
a
little
better
in
the
flavor
rich
with
orange
pill
and
candy
sugar
with
corriander
and
pale
wheat
straighforward
approach
very
light
therefore
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
wit
yet
much
is
lacking
that
could
help
benefit
this
brew
poured
into
a
glass
and
noticed
the
beer
had
a
pale
yellow
color
very
little
head
to
speak
of
and
had
a
slight
citrus
scent
the
taste
is
very
good
it
went
down
very
smooth
this
is
my
second
ballast
point
beer
and
i
am
becoming
a
fan
of
the
label
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
agrees
with
my
reviews
d
goes
down
easily
but
the
taste
doesnt
inspire
the
tastebuds
to
had
a
second
one
dusty
almost
powdery
feel
light
and
refreshing
nice
spice
and
citrus
flavor
that
rolls
well
with
the
yeasty
malt
tones
not
as
flavorful
as
say
hoegaarden
but
still
hits
the
mark
stylewise
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
enjoy
the
ballast
point
line
drinkability
is
ok
but
i
dont
really
care
for
this
one
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
the
last
two
ballast
point
beers
i
have
had
were
quite
good
this
one
however
was
not
cloudy
lemon
gold
short
fizzy
cracking
head
of
dirty
white
bubbles
that
quickly
vanishes
leaving
a
floe
of
fine
foam
big
bubbled
chunky
carbonation
streams
pop
at
the
surface
wheaty
aromas
filled
with
coriander
and
a
hint
of
sharp
orange
peel
are
on
the
light
side
but
still
nice
orange
peel
and
coriander
play
along
a
medium
light
body
peppered
with
sparky
carbonation
the
wheat
adds
a
gentle
fruitiness
while
the
orange
peel
adds
some
zip
to
the
finish
there
is
a
tingly
mouthfeel
from
the
carbonation
and
at
times
the
body
feels
a
tad
thin
the
finish
is
spiked
with
a
dash
of
cloves
and
lingering
orange
rind
zest
overall
this
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
adequately
but
not
overly
spiced
and
nicely
carbonated
pours
a
hazy
lightyellow
like
pineapple
juice
with
a
very
small
head
that
had
no
retention
the
faint
aroma
of
citrus
gently
touched
the
nose
i
couldnt
pick
out
much
afterwards
the
taste
was
a
nice
surprise
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
but
very
refreshing
the
spices
were
nicely
balanced
with
the
light
hopiness
that
tingled
across
the
tongue
very
drinkable
would
be
a
perfect
beer
on
a
warm
summer
evening
will
have
to
search
this
one
out
next
summer
drinkablilty
a
good
drinker
an
interesting
beer
which
i
liked
last
swigs
entry
level
hefe
that
would
do
any
salad
proud
otherwise
move
along
nothing
to
see
here
d
light
and
refreshing
lightly
cloying
but
not
overpowering
i
think
its
probably
from
the
heat
outside
temperature
though
i
dont
usually
think
of
ballast
point
when
i
think
of
outstanding
craft
breweries
perhaps
because
california
is
chock
full
of
them
but
ive
been
more
than
pleased
with
the
small
handful
of
their
beers
that
ive
been
fortunate
enough
to
acquire
wahoo
wheat
is
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
virtually
no
head
smells
of
wheat
bread
and
spicy
lemon
the
aroma
is
a
bit
yeasty
as
well
the
taste
is
of
spicy
wheat
and
a
very
strong
lemon
flavor
with
some
orange
mixing
in
very
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
there
is
nothing
that
really
jumps
out
in
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
all
of
the
components
just
seem
to
work
this
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
that
is
a
perfect
tipple
for
the
hot
100
degree
fahrenheit
day
that
we
are
having
here
in
tucson
the
beer
was
served
at
48f
and
could
even
be
a
bit
colder
to
boost
the
refreshing
quality
of
this
brew
i
was
expecting
another
hohum
wheat
beer
here
and
this
beer
is
not
that
it
is
perhaps
not
the
most
flavorful
witbier
and
in
fact
seems
to
have
some
leanings
towards
the
american
wheat
side
of
the
spectrum
but
this
beer
is
a
great
beer
to
be
drinking
on
this
warm
summer
afternoon
not
a
half
bad
wheat
beer
here
it
is
certainly
the
equal
of
blue
moon
and
far
better
than
90
of
the
uninspired
wheat
beers
produced
in
the
usa
very
drinkable
and
well
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
like
the
beer
style
notes
it
was
really
about
average
in
my
book
nothing
fascinating
to
talk
about
it
was
rather
mundane
a
topic
thats
been
on
the
boards
alot
is
how
can
a
brewery
not
put
freshness
dates
on
their
beers
while
it
doesnt
bother
me
that
much
on
most
beers
a
freakin
4
wit
needs
one
for
sure
overall
funny
how
i
thought
woohoo
when
i
saw
this
new
wahoo
brew
from
ballast
point
in
bevmo
ballast
point
is
a
personal
favorite
amongst
the
west
coast
breweries
that
seem
to
lay
low
on
the
radar
stakes
this
is
nice
enough
but
it
lacks
a
little
specialness
for
me
to
pick
this
one
up
again
a
pleasant
easy
drinker
kind
of
mellow
for
the
style
which
is
interesting
since
its
a
mellow
style
to
start
with
this
was
one
awesome
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
at
davebusters
and
if
it
werent
5
35
a
glass
i
would
have
drank
much
more
it
poured
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stuck
around
till
the
end
and
left
very
nice
lace
the
beer
was
very
hazy
of
corse
and
you
could
not
see
through
it
at
all
the
smell
was
very
crisp
and
citrusy
the
taste
was
awesome
one
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
had
in
awhile
there
was
a
great
orangeish
tang
to
it
along
with
a
slight
hop
bite
at
the
end
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
would
be
a
good
transition
beer
for
people
trying
to
get
into
the
world
of
craft
brews
poured
nice
and
pale
with
a
dense
dense
creamy
tasting
foamy
head
strong
generic
fruity
nose
with
a
little
spice
maybe
some
banana
hop
bitterness
is
low
not
overly
yeasty
flavor
is
not
very
intense
but
there
are
no
off
flavors
and
it
makes
a
nice
light
beer
to
go
with
really
light
food
my
risotto
and
shrimp
dish
was
a
little
much
for
it
even
this
impressive
and
refreshing
belgian
white
ale
is
quite
a
good
catch
the
presenting
color
is
cloudy
and
almost
white
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
is
a
nice
tangy
ester
with
a
subtle
hop
presence
a
very
nice
representation
this
is
an
exemplary
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
wheat
citrus
and
coriander
all
present
and
in
awesome
balance
go
to
wit
on
a
warm
day
nice
zest
not
too
much

nice
mellow
aftertaste
reminiscent
of
a
german
wheat
can
pour
have
had
this
beer
many
times
and
it
is
a
good
goto
wheat
ale
coriander
and
a
hint
of
salt
comes
through
amongst
the
bready
yeastiness
light
orange
comes
into
the
mix
and
makes
this
a
refreshing
beer
that
lends
itself
well
to
warm
weather
months
one
of
the
better
wits
ive
had
pale
straw
color
big
banana
aroma
i
like
that
the
taste
is
mostly
spice
coriander
and
orange
not
much
banana
at
all
excellent
example
of
the
style
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
topping
lemen
and
wheat
to
the
nose
a
bit
metallic
tastes
of
coriander
of
course
with
lemon
faint
grapefruit
and
a
little
orange
smooth
but
has
a
chalky
aftertaste
a
simple
yet
fairly
tasty
reminder
that
the
basics
can
still
be
fun
good
clean
finish
not
too
heavy
clouded
golden
apricot
body
looks
great
wispy
bright
egg
shell
white
head
fine
speckled
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
glass
aroma
has
heavy
yeast
driven
and
spicy
notes
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
additions
the
yeast
notes
and
spice
additions
combine
into
this
chalky
citric
chamomile
tea
like
quality
flavor
has
soft
bitterness
that
tastes
floral
spicy
coriander
citric
notes
lavender
herbal
quality
very
complex
well
made
witbier
maybe
too
much
spice
for
some
witbier
drinkers
but
in
my
opinion
it
stays
balanced
mouthfeel
ive
enjoyed
every
revolution
beer
ive
tasted
so
far
the
textures
here
are
perfect
slightly
creamy
edge
from
the
wheat
additions
spicy
adds
a
nice
dry
finish
with
some
upfront
wheat
notes
bitter
orange
peel
levels
the
malt
layers
out
as
well
a
great
food
and
drink
beer
this
would
pair
well
with
so
many
different
dishes
rosemarygarlic
braised
lamb
white
fish
any
chicken
dish
overall
a
complex
refreshing
well
executed
witbier
canned
in
chicago
this
witbier
really
got
me
thinking
about
the
warm
weather
months
ahead
although
the
finish
was
a
bit
strange
i
really
enjoyed
the
intensity
of
this
beer
and
would
rank
it
as
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
o
refreshing
but
a
little
harsh
in
its
delivery
not
a
standout
but
a
decent
wit
served
in
a
clear
plastic
cup
at
the
chicago
french
market
beautiful
golden
color
and
good
effervescence
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
like
a
macrobrew
but
with
more
of
a
backbone
i
couldnt
pick
out
any
flavor
aside
from
beer
but
it
was
definitely
hearty
and
satisfying
couldnt
really
taste
any
spices
at
all
o
not
the
greatest
fan
of
wit
beers
i
suppose
i
just
prefer
the
comparative
heartiness
of
fullon
wheat
beers
as
for
this
beer
i
felt
i
came
to
enjoy
it
the
more
i
drank
it
refreshing
and
effervescent
certainly
one
of
the
better
wit
beers
ive
tried
and
better
than
hoegaarden
in
my
book
o
i
tend
to
go
for
belgian
strong
and
wit
beers
so
i
no
doubt
am
a
bit
biased
but
i
could
definitely
keep
coming
back
for
more
of
this
one
that
being
said
there
are
other
ones
out
there
that
i
think
i
like
a
bit
more
this
wit
certainly
did
not
blow
me
away
although
this
style
will
rarely
do
that
to
me
i
thought
it
was
appropriate
maybe
a
little
soft
on
the
wit
flavors
while
that
wheat
malt
really
stands
out
on
the
palate
o
good
witbier
i
dig
the
cans
but
in
the
end
not
the
best
bang
for
your
buck
the
mouthfeel
is
great
lightmedium
bodied
very
refreshing
carbonation
slightly
bites
the
tip
of
the
tongue
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
lemons
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
spices
lemons
some
wheat
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
althought
not
the
most
flavorful
wit
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
overall
the
crack
was
nothing
notable
so
i
decided
to
spice
things
up
with
an
inverted
glug
oh
man
was
that
ever
the
right
idea
it
got
everything
in
suspension
out
of
suspension
and
the
result
looked
like
banana
cream
pie
with
meringue
topping
two
fingers
of
dense
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
sat
atop
a
murky
yellowish
liquid
that
looked
like
either
freshlysqueezed
grapefruit
or
banana
pudding
man
as
a
kid
i
used
to
love
instant
banana
pudding
with
real
banana
slices
i
still
love
eating
bananas
yellow
amusing
tasty
back
to
basics
the
nose
smelled
like
someone
emptied
the
spice
rack
i
remember
a
playboy
cartoon
as
a
kid
where
the
guy
is
positioned
to
partake
of
some
salmon
and
he
looks
upward
with
the
caption
being
i
knew
this
was
going
to
be
good
but
seeing
a
spice
rack
above
your
headboard
i
did
not
get
it
at
the
time
but
i
do
now
gutes
essen
black
pepper
or
lemon
pepper
was
prevalent
but
so
was
coriander
and
allspice
the
first
and
i
hesitate
to
call
it
a
sip
more
like
a
draught
was
big
and
full
not
quite
viscous
but
getting
there
and
the
spices
were
fantastic
i
think
that
i
caught
some
vanilla
in
the
mix
rounding
the
edges
man
but
the
spices
were
prevalent
in
this
one
i
used
to
love
to
cook
as
a
teenager
and
i
was
probably
better
versed
then
than
i
am
today
but
this
was
like
a
spice
melange
finish
as
you
can
probably
imagine
was
bonedry
i
felt
like
i
had
been
licking
alum
this
afternoon
all
of
that
said
would
i
put
in
the
cooler
perhaps
a
few
depending
on
who
was
coming
along
if
it
were
just
me
one
might
be
enough
thanks
jonallan
for
the
opportunity
the
bottom
up
is
a
decent
witbier
the
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
as
i
was
careful
not
to
pour
a
lot
of
settlement
into
my
glass
the
scent
carries
faint
lemony
citrus
the
taste
has
some
bitter
characteristics
that
mesh
well
with
the
lemon
flare
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
and
the
carbonation
is
good
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
overall
has
a
ton
of
the
accents
a
nice
summer
beer
should
have
nothing
that
blows
you
away
but
through
and
through
a
rounded
and
pleasant
beer
othe
combination
of
the
off
balance
and
the
slight
metallic
taste
ruined
the
beer
your
classic
american
reincarnation
of
a
belgian
wit
this
one
is
a
little
heavy
on
both
the
coriander
and
the
orange
but
it
works
bright
yellow
pour
almost
looks
like
an
electric
hoegaarden
with
similar
haze
and
head
the
nose
is
really
herbal
and
super
yeasty
tons
of
lemon
zest
notes
and
sudsy
spice
from
the
belgian
yeast
flavor
starts
off
with
light
wheat
malt
followed
by
bitter
and
sweet
orange
peel
alike
and
finally
a
super
herbal
wash
from
toasted
coriander
seeds
and
maybe
even
fresh
coriander
its
potent
low
alcohol
but
tons
of
body
on
this
one
a
little
heavier
than
the
style
asks
for
and
isnt
as
sessionable
as
a
result
good
carbonation
though
and
a
light
soapy
texture
to
its
long
finish
two
of
these
was
plenty
as
its
just
a
tad
filling
nothing
way
out
here
just
a
good
american
tip
of
the
cap
to
the
belgian
witbier
this
one
is
more
robust
than
most

the
dust
settles

the

alive
and
well

the

is
better
of
for
it
o
the
slightly

beer
has
a
nice
perceived
dryness
with
the
spice
in
the
finish
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
taste
but
it
is
a
meal
in
a
glass
o
a
good
wit
very
accurate
to
the
style
with
a
pleasantly
appealing

easy

this
is
a

nonetheless
its
extremely
drinkable
and
i
can
see
myself
buying
it
for
a
group
of
people
on
a
warm
summer
day
o
an
entirely
serviceable
wit
o
not
terribly
exciting
but
not
my
favorite
style
either
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
probably
wont
again
on
the
upside
a
very
cool
can
o
like
i
stated
from
the
onset
revolution
brews
some
good
shit
overall
this
is
another
great
canned
creation
that
i
would
want
to
have
again
im
adding

quite

this
an
easy
favorite
over
something
like
blue

particularly
since
it
is
made
locally
this
beer
also
has
a
really
nice
rich
mouthfeel
its
great
o
a
very
good
wit
beer
and
will
def
get
this
again
revolution
is
a
brewery
you
can
really
get
behind
all
their
beers
are
very
good
and
they
know
their
food
as
well
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
wit
chugable
even
funky
hay
smell
with
a
taste
of
bread
and
candied
orange
zest
the
balance
is
really
what
makes
this
beer
my
only
gripe
is
the
cost
because
you
can
just
polish
these
off
was
it
marx
who
said
opiates
are
the
beer
of
the
masses
o
this
is
a
perfectly
quaffable
summer
wit
beer
cant
wait
to
see
how
it
fares
during
the
colder
fallwinter
chicago
months
so
does
only
one
person
get
to
drink
then
anyway
this
stuf
pours
a
lightly
hazy
pale
brass
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
coriander
light
black
pepper
cracked
wheat
lemon
zest
orange
zest
and
a
touch
of
cardamom
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
those
orange
tones
really
pulling
their
weights
here
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
generally
crisp
if
still
a
touch
wet
finish
overall
a
very
nice
very
refreshing
little
witbier
ive
heard
servers
tell
people
this
beer
is
like
blue
moon
for
grownups
i
enjoy
the
mild
spiciness
and
citrus
notes
but
i
occasionally
get
a
sulfidic
twang
in
the
back
of
the
throat
following
my
first
few
gulps
ive
noticed
this
more
when
the
beer
is
really
fresh
its
appearance
when
freshly
tapped
looks
more
like
pale
oj
than
a
beer
other
than
the
wonderful
froth
that
sticks
around
for
quite
some
time
when
in
this
state
the
yeast
is
almost
too
much
and
contributes
to
the
aforementioned
twang
their
beer
always
seems
fresh
probably
because
it
is
but
this
one
benefits
from
sitting
in
the
tank
a
few
extra
days
ask
the
bartender
if
its
a
new
batch
or
not
prior
to
committing
to
16
oz
when
ive
ordered
it
outside
the
logan
square
brewpub
which
its
starting
to
pop
up
in
several
other
spots
this
hasnt
been
a
problem
o
a
decent
witbier
but
i
would
pass
on
it
given
another
opportunity
the
mouthfeel
really
did
it
in
for
me
and
the
flavors
were
kind
of
muted
the
mouth
is
slick
with
midlevel
carbonation
i
think
this
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
have
no
problem
repeating
this
one
pours
a
very
hazy
yellowish
color
with
a
bit
of
gold
to
it
nice
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
as
it
falls
the
nose
is
really
nice
and
does
a
superb
job
hitting
all
the
hot
points
in
the
style
with
a
great
wheat
base
along
with
some
nice
orange
and
a
slight
bit
of
coriander
great
balance
between
everything
the
taste
is
the
same
offering
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
the
perfect
amount
of
coriander
and
citrus
peel
to
complement
good
body
a
bit
creamy
drinks
quite
well
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
better
wits
ive
had
in
a
long
time
very
good
for
the
style
overall
highly
drinkable
overall
very
good
my
favorite
revoltuion
beer
d
easy
to
get
down
and
order
more
nothing
overpowering
that
makes
this
one
hard
to
drink
after
a
while
would
definately
get
it
again
much
like
the
other
revolution
beers
which
i
have
sampled
to
this
point
i
can
only
describe
this
as
unique
someone
below
me
said
this
before
i
could
say
it
but
it
does
seem
like
a
fairly
modern
twist
which
has
a
decent
classic
backing
some
may
disagree
with
me
but
i
found
the
coriander
to
be
the
defining
element
of
this
beer
it
makes
this
beer
both
lively
and
unique
it
may
not
be
for
everyone
but
i
found
it
enjoyable
definately
try
it
once
if
youre
looking
for
an
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
very
good
beer
no
complaints
we
had
some
at
the
brewery
and
then
took
a
growler
of
this
home
get
some
flavor
was
more
punchy
with
light
orange
peel
and
a
supple
mellow
feel
from
the
wheat
it
finished
dry
with
a
mildly
tart
citrus
peel
note
in
the
background
not
too
heavy
or
phenolic
as
some
wits
can
be
it
was
nicely
balanced
and
a
touch
on
the
bigger
side
mellow
carbonation
with
a
soft
mouthfeel
the
flavors
really
shined
in
this
wit
and
ive
had
a
few
in
my
day
that
i
can
say
it
stands
out
from
the
rest
definitely
traditional
with
a
slightly
amped
up
edge
the
banche
de
chamby
is
decent
but
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
a
six
of
it
the
beer
was
poured
carefully
into
a
tulip
glass
to
avoid
the
settlement
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
was
golden
in
color
with
foamy
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
scent
was
chardonnay
like
with
hints
of
orange
spice
the
taste
was
much
like
a
belgian
white
the
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
good
and
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
o
i
like
this
unibroue
offering
because
of
the
relatively
low
alcohol
content
it
is
a
solid
easy
drinking
wheat
ale
first
sip
at
cafe
in
quebec
city
june
2012
with
andy
o
gotta
say
little
disappointed
here
was
expecting
a
solid
brew
and
was
let
down
its
an
average
beer
in
my
opinion
at
best
flavors
are
there
the
look
is
there
but
it
just
didnt
seem
executed
well
as
stated
before
maybe
a
bad
batch
but
it
was
incredibly
bitter
up
front
which
kind
of
took
away
from
some
of
the
flavors
i
am
more
of
a
complex
beer
appreciator
so
this
one
might
be
a
little
bit
light
for
my
style
that
being
said
i
have
tried
others
of
a
similar
style
and
enjoyed
them
quite
a
bit
one
of
my
favourite
beers
one
of
my
favourite
breweries
but
this
one
just
is
a
miss
for
myself
hmm
very
refreshing
so
much
flavor
compared
to
watered
down
american
versions
of
this
style
taste
some
lemon
spices
and
cloves
crisp
carbonation
its
crisp
and
refreshingly
light
with
a
floral
character
and
some
orange
peel
and
coriander
coming
through
delicious
overall
excellent
fresh
white
beer
missing
a
little
taste
and
some
feel
while
not
too
heavy
while
eating
this
tasted
more
like
a
hefe
then
a
wit
i
couldnt
detect
as
much
spice
as
i
would
like
from
a
wit
and
there
were
a
lot
more
banana
esters
than
i
would
expect
from
a
wit
it
was
a
solid
beer
but
a
little
off
for
the
style
i
think
picked
up
a
single
fresh
bottle
at
cafe
craft
in
north
charleston
sc
after
scoring
the
tin
foil
cap
and
popping
the
top
i
proceeded
to
pour
the
dirty
blonde
ale
in
to
a
tall
wit
tulip
exceptionally
cloudy
with
tons
of
unfiltered
particulates
floating
freely
the
drink
dons
a
3finger
frothy
foam
head
of
fine
bubbles
most
of
the
foam
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
it
left
a
nice
thin
layer
that
endured
decent
retention
with
no
lacing
lots
of
coriander
in
the
nose
with
a
citrusy
orange
zest
faint
grassy
wooden
aroma
in
the
background
the
first
sip
brings
a
distinct
lemon
sourness
tart
with
grains
of
wheat
in
the
finish
nearly
undetectable
clove
spice
simple
aside
from
the
coriander
and
citrus
the
beer
is
lacking
complexity
mostly
due
to
the
sparing
use
of
competing
spices
ultimately
i
think
that
adds
to
the
charm
of
this
one
the
carbonation
is
lively
and
the
body
is
somewhat
thin
refreshing
this
beer
immediately
makes
me
think
of
summer
time
with
its
fresh
lemon
citrus
flare
and
easy
drinkability
this
beer
is
the
perfect
companion
for
a
hot
sunny
day
while
not
the
best
wit
ive
had
ill
take
this
over
any
number
of
the
crappy
shandy
varieties
ive
sampled
ok
would
not
buy
again
one
of
the
best
whit
beers
ive
tried
crisp
refreshing
taste
really
brings
it
to
a
new
level
great
beer
for
its
style
overall
an
excellent
and
highquality
witbier
highly
recommended
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
wit
from
first
pour
i
was
impressed
by
the
orangeygold
colour
the
slightly
offwhite
head
and
the
steady
carbonation
you
find
in
most
unibroue
offerings
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
i
can
picture
it
fitting
with
a
wide
variety
of
foods
and
settings
the
lovely
fruit
flavours
apricot
organge
and
bit
of
lemon
give
blanche
de
chambly
a
tasty
but
not
cloying
overall
sweetness
cest
fantastique
this
beer
has
exceeded
my
expectations
and
i
would
definatley
recommend
for
any
fellow
beer
drinker
it
has
a
smoothness
comparable
to
the
greats
and
it
goes
down
quite
easily
it
is
a
full
beer
that
has
a
lasting
flavor
the
only
annoying
part
is
peeling
the
tinfoil
off
to
get
at
the
beer
but
after
that
its
all
flavor
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
white
ales
but
as
for
as
they
go
this
one
is
at
the
top
i
would
even
consider
drinking
it
on
a
regular
basis
this
is
my
3rd
beer
rating
so
i
could
have
my
beer
goggles
on
however
i
feel
even
at
this
inebriated
state
i
am
capable
of
judging
accurately
before
i
thought
the
french
were
snobby
jerks
but
now
i
am
starting
to
like
them
a
very
nice
beer
for
pairing
with
something
like
seafood
interesting
fruity
esters
and
flavours
and
generally
wellbalanced
a
lighter
offering
from
unibroue
their
yeast
still
comes
through
enjoy
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
sure
but
not
with
big
you
have
to
tried
it
i
mean
if
you
got
the
chance
try
it
but
if
you
don
t
get
the
chance
you
don
t
have
to
try
it
if
you
really
wanna
have
a
unibroue
go
for
la
fin
du
monde
or
don
de
dieu
or
even
trois
pistoles
is
a
much
better
option
but
as
a
unibroue
man
this
is
a
good
damn
beer
o
not
as
unique
as
many
of
their
other
offerings
but
certainly
an
easy
drinker
and
available
at
a
very
reasonable
price
in
nova
scotia
im
not
very
experienced
on
this
style
my
guess
is
it
is
probably
good
for
the
style
that
it
is
but
its
not
for
me
too
much
like
chardonnay
in
wine
speak
feels
flat
and
flowery
i
much
prefer
some
strong
carbonation
and
yeast
twang
in
my
wheat
beers
mild
floral
and
citrus
aromas
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
minimal
head
looks
great
light
sour
taste
light
body
oily
texture
and
average
carbonation
overall
not
a
bad
white
beer
a
good
one
for
a
hot
day
love
it
o
a
good
white
refreshing
and
fruityflavorful

nyc
as
its
early
july
this
is
right
on
the
money
the
most
surprising
thing
is
the
fullness
of
the
flavor
that
leaves
barely
any
aftertaste
its
not
particularly
dry
as
most
that
have
this
trait
are
i
could
drink
this
all
day
night
gives
you
the
mouthfeel
and
flavor
that
you
desire
coupled
with
a
spicy
aroma
its
mostly
everything
yet
simplicity
for
the
hoegaarden
fans
you
need
to
get
your
hands
on
this
awesome
beer
overall
a
great
witbier
very
refreshing
a
great
beer
in
the
warmer
weather
months
but
also
enjoyable
yearround
though
pouring
this
gorgeous
beverage
looks
incredibly
promising
the
taste
and
feel
seem
too
light
to
leave
an
impression
the
orange
is
almost
overwhelming
the
first
kick
is
light
but
great
and
the
aftertaste
is
greater
its
all
the
steps
in
the
middle
that
make
this
drink
lackluster
deliciously
light
and
easy
carbonated
moderately
nice
what
new
can
be
said
about
this
beer
its
a
quebec
classic
appearance
is
light
yellow
and
cloudy
as
a
good
witbier
should
be
yeasty
nose
with
orange
and
spices
dominate
taste
is
clean
and
spicy
with
good
carbonation
all
in
all
a
solid
beer
thats
true
to
form
pours
out
to
a
creamy
head
thin
lacing
and
cloudy
gold
color
aroma
is
citrus
coriander
and
bananaclovebubblegum
notes
flavor
is
generally
good
for
style
with
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
coming
through
and
the
aged
hops
and
sharp
tang
of
wheat
in
the
finish
there
is
a
hint
of
alka
seltzer
in
there
too
mouthfeel
is
light
and
tingly
overall
a
very
good
ale
from
quebec
drinkability
at
its
best
hard
to
beat
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
other
hand
same
flavors
could
be
more
bold
and
with
a
more
robust
body
so
you
can
say
it
is
not
at
par
with
other
unibroue
brews
ps
expectation
is
a
bitch
but
why
not
have
a
refreshing
faithful
to
style
wit
lastly
i
noticed
that
when
it
warms
up
changes
completely
and
becomes
more
complex
and
robust
which
is
common
but
here
it
is
more
delayed
than
usual
i
was
a
bit
confused
to
go
back
or
not
to
rewrite
the
evaluation
o
blanche
may
please
others
as
the
bitterness
and
high
carbonation
may
amount
to
preference
as
it
is
im
unlikely
to
have
this
again
as
this
style
is
one
of
the
few
where
im
looking
for
a
six
pack
or
larger
at
an
affordable
price
shoot
me
but
i
prefer
hoegaarden
an
overly
gaseous
beer
that
kills
the
palate
and
the
nose
is
off
putting
to
unfortunately
go
with
it
ill
be
passing
on
this
one
this
is
a
very
hazy
light
golden
ale
carbonation
looks
very
light
on
this
one
and
head
retention
is
nonexistent
that
cork
was
in
pretty
tight
but
it
seems
flat
aroma
is
strongly
that
of
pale
wheat
closely
followed
by
orange
and
a
bit
of
coriander
finishes
it
out
mouth
does
show
some
carbonationbut
it
still
seems
somewhat
thin
the
flavor
is
a
gentle
blend
of
pale
wheat
and
soft
notes
of
orange
i
get
just
a
trace
of
coriander
worth
getting
again
o
this
beer
has
that
typical
spiciness
associated
with
the
style
perhaps
not
as
spicy
as
a
saison
but
its
always
definitely
there
i
like
the
berries
and
citrus
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
peach
in
the
flavor
definitely
recommended
one
of
my
favorites
from
unibroue
o
disappointing
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
thin
not
compelling
savory
offnote
the
nose
is
easily
the
strongest
element
it
is
smooth
and
spicy
and
really
is
pretty
good
o
a
solid
witbier
which
is
aboveaverage
and
got
my
night
off
to
a
good
start
not
up
to
the
style
standard

i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
enjoys
the
style
i
have
never
had
a
bad
beer
from
unibroue
excellent
brewery
one
of
the
best
in
all
of
north
america
for
sure
o
this
was
a
lot
more
tame
compared
to
what
i
have
recently
sampled
from
unibroue
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
a
easy
to
drink
beer
with
some
delicious
flavors
this
would
be
golden
during
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
think
its
an
ale
that
everyone
would
enjoy
pours
a
light
straw
color
hazy
with
a
cottony
head
of
white
foam
the
nose
took
quite
a
while
to
develop
it
was
faint
to
begin
with
then
it
gained
some
tart
citrus
apple
and
a
spice
the
yeast
wasnt
that
funky
on
the
nose
and
the
malt
was
a
light
sweetness
there
was
a
nice
fresh
orange
peel
and
wheat
the
whisper
of
banana
and
clove
and
maybe
some
coriander
as
it
warmed
it
developed
a
stone
fruit
juicy
scent
that
was
very
enticing
taste
is
bland
and
a
bit
plain
the
malt
was
a
light
cracker
on
the
palate
the
tart
citrus
was
very
strong
the
spice
competed
for
the
palate
and
won
out
over
any
sweet
fruit
the
wheat
imparted
dryness
and
it
was
as
dry
as
champagne
i
liked
that
it
lacked
flavor
the
banana
could
have
been
more
prominent
and
imparted
a
creaminess
to
the
flavor
the
clove
could
have
added
depth
the
carbonation
is
the
lions
share
of
the
mouthfeel
and
except
for
it
this
beer
is
thin
hazy
straw
gold
with
a
big
frothy
pure
white
head
in
the
glass
these
bubbles
take
a
long
while
to
subside
the
smell
is
pretty
standard
for
a
wit
it
also
has
the
typical
unibroue
yeasty
tang
in
there
as
well
orange
banana
coriander
and
wheat
bread
round
it
out
overall
it
may
be
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
the
taste
is
clean
with
this
one
with
the
wheat
providing
a
solid
base
and
the
majority
of
the
taste
profile
in
general
also
in
there
are
hints
of
spice
yeast
esters
and
citrus
high
levels
of
carbonation
make
this
quite
tingly
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
and
dry
while
the
bitterness
to
sweetness
ratio
is
fairly
neutral
with
little
of
both
overall
it
is
another
good
offering
from
this
brewery
maybe
not
their
best
but
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
overy
nice
brew
and
a
step
up
from
other
witbiers
and
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
that
ive
ever
had
the
witbier
offering
from
my
favorite
canadian
brewery
pours
a
nice
murky
burnt
apple
juice
gold
with
a
ton
of
white
head
an
aggressive
pour
might
leave
cakes
of
yeast
swimming
in
your
glass
but
it
makes
little
sense
to
pour
this
beer
like
a
sissy
you
want
the
froth
effect
trust
me
aroma
is
bready
malt
apples
citrus
spice
a
touch
of
herbs
palate
is
a
bouquet
of
the
expected
coriander
citrus
pith
and
fruit
orange
lemon
a
bit
of
tropical
pineapple
which
combines
with
a
creamy
mouth
feel
to
produce
a
pina
colada
effect
and
a
subtle
apple
cinnamon
spice
refreshing
but
not
boring
finish
is
sweet
and
herbal
with
a
lingering
yeasty
sweetness
almost
like
caramel
corn
almost
no
detectable
alcohol
or
technical
flaws
i
can
pick
out
carbonation
is
lively
and
right
where
it
needs
to
be
to
lift
the
fruit
and
spice
an
archetypal
belgian
witbier
and
i
echo
the
other
reviewers
who
feel
this
is
the
standard
to
which
others
should
be
compared
remember
beer
isnt
always
about
what
has
the
the
most
in
your
face
flavor
sometimes
it
is
about
the
subtle
complexity
the
hint
of
what
lies
underneath
that
brings
you
back
for
more
i
am
in
california
and
snap
this
up
whenever
i
can
do
yourself
a
favor
and
do
the
same
if
youre
a
fan
of
wheat
beer
o
great
light
subtle
flavors
and
feel
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
my
tummy
pours
a
hazy
yellow
into
my
tulip
with
a
lumpy
head
that
quickly
fades
to
some
nice
fine
lacing
around
the
collar
scent
of
coriander
orange
wheat
and
a
hint
of
lemon
taste
is
much
the
same
well
balanced
and
smooth
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
the
abv
makes
for
easy
drinking
it
is
a
somewhat
similar
and
lighter
brother
to
la
fin
du
monde
aftertaste
is
wonderfully
clean
and
slightly
creamy
recommended
especially
for
the
price
pours
fizzy
white
residual
yellow
kind
of
a
dirty
gold
wheaty
nose
orange
peel
and
hint
of
coriander
lemon
open
slightly
tart

and
even
keeled
packed
with
citrus
flavor
light
just
really
damn
good
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
but
they
know
what
theyre
doing
up
there
light
bodied
with
average
carbonation
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
witbier
style
and
another
winner
from
unibroue
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
if
you
are
going
to
buy
a
bottle
from
unibroue
get
a
bottle
of
terrible
you
wont
be
sorry
i
will
say
if
you
are
new
to
craft
beer
then
you
need
to
start
with
a
beer
like
this
not
this
particular
bottle
but
a
beer
that
is
light
and
has
subtle
flavors
like
the
coriander
and
the
orange
zest
i
will
stick
with
my
belgian
darks
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
but
downgraded
somewhat
due
to
the
price
witbiers
of
comparable
quality
can
be
found
at
lower
prices
than
the
10
99
i
paid
for
a
4pack
o
very
refreshing
easydrinking
unibroue
quality
o
a
rather
refreshing
beer
and
its
quiet
good
but
nothing
astounding
its
pleasing
and
decent
but
nothing
that
stood
out
to
me
i
have
2
left
and
a
750ml
as
well
so
im
a
happy
camper
i
might
buy
it
again
but
i
would
take
other
beers
over
it
o
a
good
example
of
a
domestic
belgian
wit
not
overdone
on
the
spices
but
could
use
a
little
more
flavor
really
good
example
of
its
style
the
flavor
didnt
seem
terribly
pronounced
to
me
but
it
was
pleasant
if
subdued
tasting
ridiculously
drinkable
i
remember
seeing
a
travel
show
at
one
point
where
they
said
that
the
proper
way
to
drink
a
white
beer
was
in
three
gulps
who
knows
if
it
was
a
crock
or
not
but
it
always
seemed
beyond
my
beer
drinking
abilities
im
not
a
chugger
however
i
could
totally
see
drinking
this
beer
that
way
o
i
love
this
beer
i
love
almost
everything
unibroue
makes
but
what
really
makes
this
shine
for
me
is
that
its
really
the
only
sessionable
beer
they
make
yes
trois
pistoles
or
la
fin
du
monde
are
better
beers
but
you
cant
drink
them
all
night
at
9
also
im
seriously
not
a
fan
of
the
witbier
style
and
the
fact
that
i
enjoy
this
so
much
is
a
credit
to
them
one
of
the
better
witbiers
out
there
unibroue
is
a
great
brewery
loads
of
pear
a
canadian
benchmark
that
should
appeal
to
many
as
my
tastes
get
a
bit
more
refined
from
trying
all
of
these
lagers
and
ales
and
reviewing
them
i
find
that
this
brewer
in
particular
has
some
very
creative
offerings
ranging
from
very
heavy
almost
heartburn
causing
tripel
to
this
session
worth
wiess
i
would
reccommend
this
to
any
fans
of
wiess
and
this
brewer
they
have
a
certain
something
that
carries
over
through
different
styles
but
is
always
complex
and
obviously
held
to
a
very
high
standard
of
quality
not
something
i
would
drink
every
day
but
definatly
not
one
to
miss
aside
from
hoegaarden
which
is
about
on
par
in
quality
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
available
while
this
isnt
my
favorite
unibroue
offerring
its
still
enjoyable
very
easy
drinking
sessionable
beer
more
complexity
than
a
lot
of
witbiers
which
isnt
surprising
considering
the
brewery
i
could
easily
drink
this
often
although
it
might
be
a
bit
more
satisfying
in
the
summer
months
this
went
down
fast
so
its
clear
i
enjoyed
the
taste
good
job
overall
kick
ass
i
am
partial
to
darker
brew
but
to
review
in
accordance
with
the
style
i
think
it
was
spot
on
that
being
said
i
still
really
enjoy
it
and
will
pick
one
up
next
time
the
temp
rises
and
honestly
when
compared
to
blue
moon
i
think
it
blows
it
away
but
thats
just
me
o
solid
not
something
id
seek
out
but
good
especially
when
looking
for
something
refreshing
not
one
of
unibroues
best
but
that
is
hardly
a
knock
on
this
beer
considering
the
brewerys
lineup
i
was
not
impressed
by
the
taste
of
this
beer
its
very
watery
and
not
very
complex
its
easy
to
drink
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
nothing
i
would
want
to
get
again
in
particular
o
ive
had
blanche
de
chambly
often
over
the
past
5
or
so
years
and
it
deserved
a
review
long
ago
this
was
one
of
the
first
unibroue
beers
i
picked
up
and
one
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
its
a
good
representation
of
the
belgian
witbier
style
and
probably
the
best
coming
from
north
america
canadian
craft
breweries
are
often
overlooked
but
without
question
unibroue
is
one
that
are
excellent
at
what
they
do
blanche
de
chambly
is
a
very
good
beer
in
an
often
under
done
style
considering
its
belgian
this
is
a
worthy
ale
in
the
warm
months
and
fairly
easy
to
require
anywhere
its
worth
the
purchase
for
anyone
who
appreciates
class
beer
o
this
is
a
traditional
beer
that
has
traits
of
a
belgian
ale
again
the
yeast
used
adds
a
unique
quality
i
like
coming
back
to
unibroue
for
their
european
vibe
on
craft
brewing
in
north
america
the
best
belgian
wit
ive
ever
had
even
blows
the
ones
directly
from
belgium
right
out
of
the
water
poured
into
a
glass
mug
slowly
and
surely
shook
the
remaining
34
and
added
all
yeast
and
sediment
into
the
glass
frothy
milky
head
that
stayed
all
the
way
throughout
the
drinking
of
this
dynamite
beer
smells
of
fresh
oranges
coriander
and
i
get
a
hint
of
the
sweet
belgian
yeast
as
well
lacing
is
super
intense
almost
looks
like
i
bathed
this
one
in
a
bubble
bath
i
would
say
that
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
should
point
someone
to
who
is
looking
for
accurate
depictions
on
the
belgian
wit
style
the
bjcp
folks
out
there
should
study
this
one
and
disregard
lesser
versions
like
hoegaarden
that
while
good
just
dont
stand
out
like
this
great
quebec
brew
unibroue
is
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
and
it
makes
an
alberta
guy
like
me
happy
that
this
one
came
without
the
whining
and
crying
that
usually
comes
along
with
most
things

a
bottle
o
unique
well
balanced
and
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
i
have
grown
fond
of
wits
due
to
their
easy
drinkability
paired
with
that
refreshing
finish
not
the
best
out
of
this
crew
but
something
that
contends
with
some
of
the
top
notch
in
the
style
overall
a
nice
example
of
a
wit
it
is
smooth
with
good
flavor
and
a
quite
nice
feel
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
guess
i
was
expecting
more
i
dont
know
but
its
probably
the
wrong
reason
for
this
beer
its
so
crisp
airy
light
and
refreshing
its
probably
better
to
have
this
guy
during
the
warmer
months
not
colder
its
also
pretty
expensive
for
what
it
is
four
double
the
price
on
a
standard
355ml
bottle
i
really
expect
something
for
that
price
tag
to
knock
my
socks
off
and
well
my
socks
are
still
on
its
still
pretty
good
just
over
priced
still
recommend
it

im
typically
not
a
big
fan
of
witbier
hence
the
reason
ive
passed
over
this
beer
for
years
this
is
actually
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
could
see
this
as
a
future
summer
beer
for
me
o
when
i
saw
the
unibroue
label
i
knew
from
my
past
experience
that
this
would
probably
be
good
and
it
was
unibroue
is
coming
close
to
joining
samuel
smiths
as
my
favorite
brand
theres
no
doubt
ill
go
back
for
more
of
this
excellent
witbier
better
than
some
belgian
versions
ive
had
and
seek
out
others
from
their

the
most

this
is
a
good

this
one
the
final
verdict
good
summer
beer
i
will
be
sure
to
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
during
the
summer
get
this
beer
a
grill
some
lemonpepper
chicken
and
mild
italian
sausage
that
sounds
like
the
perfect
combination
for
me
great
execution
if
mild
even
for
the
style
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
the
style
i
wasnt
initially
in
love
with
this
beer
but
its
refreshing
and
might
convert
me
nice
character
and
balance
to
it
adding
the
sediment
yeast
brings
a
great
complexity
oa
nice
easy
drinking
witbier
but
not
top
notch
overall
certainly
recommended
to
everyone
especially
if
you
are
a
witbier
fan
i
would
buy
and
drink
this
again
no
doubt
a
perfect
beer
for
a
nice
warm
summer
evening
on
the
deck
poured
from
a
75cl

the

a
b
it
seems
a
crime
that
blanche
de
chambly
is
the
only
unibroue
offering
always
available
at
the
lcbo
these
guys
just
flat
out
make
great
beer
and
this
wit
is
certainly
no
exception
to
that
fact
but
more
unibroues
would
be
appreciated
this
is
at
least
as
good
as
hoegaarden
and
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
that
beer
or
the
style
in
general
definitely
worth
a
shot
flavor
is
good
but
for
the
price
there
are
much
better
options
boulevard
zon
overall
great
flavorful
better
than
your
average
beer
mouthfeel
and
overall
very
sour
on
the
tongue
when
the
beer
first
hits
it
medium
bodied
allinall
tingles
the
tongue
and
inside
of
the
cheeks
overall
light
smooth
and
flavorful
a
very
good
summer
beer
o
refreshing
is
the
key
word
here
a
simple
and
wellbalanced
witbier
to
this
point
in
my
experience
blanche
de
chambly
is
a
champion
among
witbiers
from
a
champion
among
breweries
o
delicious
and
refreshing
a
definate
favorite
for
the
summer
complex
and
well
balanced
i
highly
recommend
oda
nice
wit
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
fresh
and
bright
flavors
solid
yet
unspectacular
o
what
is
there
to
say
that
hasnt
been
said
about
unibroue
they
brew
good
beers
and
thats
about
it
this
is
sadly
the
only
one
readily
available
at
the
lcbo
now
o
decidedly
earthy
and
light
on
the
americanized
spice
profile
blanche
de
chambly
is
wellbalanced
and
much
more
akin
to
what
the
early
examples
of
a
true
belgian
wit
would
have
been
i
find
the
heavy
carbonation
while
helping
this
beer
in
part
distracts
from
the
otherwise
desirable
soft
wheat
profile
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
with
seafood
or
basic
summer
salads
the
active
carbonation
and
tangy
flavour
make
for
an
incredibly
refreshing
brew
simple
and
very
easy
to
drink
great
brew
d
quaffable
and
refreshing
a
very
nice
beer
undoubtedly
one
of
my
favorite
unibroue
offerings
whille
note
a
seasonal
offering
this
is
a
terrific
spring
or
summer
beer
with
lots
of
sophistication
and
complexity
i
will
have
no
problem
working
through
the
half
case
that
i
just
invested
in
overall
a
great
buy
especially
considering
the
price
and
so
much
that
you
get
for
it
salud
overalll
unique
and
enjoyable
frenchcanadian

fruity
without
being
particularly
sweet
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable

the

overtones
in
it
another
great
beer
from
unibroue
served
from
tap
into
a
trappe
door
tulip
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
spices
and
fruit
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
fairly
decent
brew
for
the
style
this
was
a
great
representation
but
i
just
wish
they
would
have
gotten
a
little
crazy
with
it
to
add
some
more
complexity
to
it
it
was
quite
refreshing
but
i
just
wanted
it
to
challenge
my
palate
a
little
more
if
i
am
honest
a
great
summer
brew
to
enjoy
while
out
in
the
sunshine
though
without
a
doubt
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
to
light
with
some
nice
wheat
feel
that
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
it
goes
down
easy
and
has
an
easy
feel
that
makes
you
come
for
more
i
poured
this
into
a
goblet
and
noticed
the
thick
head
that
formed
and
the
golden
straw
color
of
the
ale
on
the
nose
this
beer
is
very
fruitycitruslike
in
aroma
which
is
to
be
expected
of
a
beer
of
this
style
but
it
had
a
crispness
to
it
that
was
most
appealing
on
the
first
taste
it
was
again
what
one
would
expect
from
a
witbier
citrusy
especially
to
me
a
tangrinelike
essence
that
was
most
refreshing
this
beer
is
smooth
velvety
smooth
likely
due
to
the
5
abv
but
i
think
also
to
the
excellence
of
the
brewing
just
very
well
crafted
the
best
of
the
unibroue
range
perhaps
not
but
it
is
still
an
excellent
brew
that
anyone
would
enjoy
on
a
warm
late
spring
day
as
a
session
beer
this
would
be
one
of
my
top
choices
easy
drinking
full
of
flavor
and
high
enough
of
an
abv
to
have
character
but
not
so
high
as
to
be
obnoxious
after
a
few
glasses
o
its
a
great
beer
but
not
the
best
by
unibroue
overall
not
a
terribly
intriguing
beer
to
taste
but
goodtasting
still
and
not
dull
either
this
would
go
great
with
bbq
nicely
tart
and
fresh
nose
tastes
even
better
excellent
balance
of
tarttangysweetwith
some
husky
grain
and
subtle
spicing
in
the
background
rather
surprisingly
thickish
but
more
than
enough
carbonation
to
keep
things
lively
nice
brew
here
bottom
line
a
very
enjoyable
beer
for
those
who
enjoy
the
style
as
it
does
not
try
to
impose
the
flavor
like
traditional
north
american
wheat
beers
d
an
excellent
witbier
thats
tasty
refreshing
and
eminently
drinkable
its
a
shame
it
hasnt
been
around
in
750
ml
bottles
for
a
while
o
this
was
a
good
witbier
nicely
balanced
and
easy
drinker
o
not
bad
but
nothing
amazing
an
easy
drinking
witbier
but
a
little
tame
imo
m
light
body
light
to
moderate
carbonation
oan
understated
clean
tasting
well
balanced
wit
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
glass
o
this
is
an
average
witbier
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
better
from
unibroue
but
its
not
bad
overall
the
sour
grassiness
and
carbonation
overwhelms
this
beer
for
me
id
much
prefer
the
complexity
and
bubble
gum
flavor
of
hoegaarden
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
cloudy
yellow
brew
very
nice
head
with
a
pretty
good
retention
the
smell
is
amazing
mostly
citrus
notes
with
strong
yeast
aromas
very
powderish
taste
is
very
good
and
confirms
the
aromas
for
me
the
major
downfall
is
the
pretty
high
carbonation
otherwise
its
an
excellence
brew
full
of
aromas
and
very
refreshing
definitely
recommend
a
very
good
witbier
highly
recommend
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
if
the
appearance
would
have
been
a
little
bitter
i
would
have
rated
higher
i
will
definitely
revisit
again
d
great
wit
a
good
beer
for
any
occasion
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
to
do
so
one
i
will
certainly
be
having
many
more
times
o
a
delicious
witbier
i
would
definitely
have
another
one
the
flavors
are
clean
but
the
carbonation
doesnt
let
them
pop
quite
enough
light
fruits
wheat
a
pinch
of
spices
and
solid
all
around
hazy
pale
blonde
one
finger
of
white
head
light

smell
is
yeatsy
with
spice
coriander
spicy
malt
orange
and
citrus
on
the
second
pint
there
was
some
light

taste
is
yeasty
and
spicy
orange
citrus
wheaty
lightly
tart
and
dry
in
the
finish
medhigh
carb
medium
body
good
feel
solid
easy

brew
high
quality
and
quite
nice
overall
i
still
go
by
what
i
said
for
unibroue
they
dont
make
bad
beers
but
i
wasnt
as
impressed
with
this
beer
it
felt
like
a
simple
witbier
their
was
no
wow
factor
that
i
was
expecting
drink
was
happy
to
try
this
one
on
tap
its
one
of
the
better
wits
available
in
my
area
and
id
drink
it
again
anytime
tastes
like
rainwater
on
a
flowerscented
evening
spicy
harvest
taste
if
only
some
brewer
would
give
a
pumpkin
ale
this
kind
of
delicate
spicing
fragrant
with
a
pleasing
taste
of
sweet
malt
nice
watery
but
carbonated
mouthfeel
this
seems
totally
typical
of
the
wit
style
i
enjoy
trying
wits
and
seeing
how
they
vary
from
brewery
to
brewery
a
good
take
on
the
style
and
while
not
my
favorite
i
found
no
flaws
in
it
and
wouldnt
hesitate
trying
it
on
tap
the
beer
is
completely
transparent
and
appears
a
light
yellow
color
the
head
is
smaller
than
expected
leaving
some
sparse
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
brings
apples
coriander
with
a
touch
of
lemon
spiced
green
apples
in
the
flavor
suitable
for
autumn
low
carbonation
and
smooth
on
the
palate
with
minimal
alcohol
presence
the
body
is
quite
thin
a
decent
example
of
the
style
simply
one
of
my
favorites
beers
it
poors
a
great
pale
golden
color
makes
a
lot
of
brew
smells
fresh
and
fruits
the
taste
is
mild
calm
with
some
little
fruit
aromas
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
this
is
to
me
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
while
relaxing
it
really
worths
the
try
o
not
bad
but
not
great
either
i
much
prefer
ephemere
apples
to
this
or
even
la
fin
du
monde
maudite
or
any
of
the
other
unibroue
styles
this
is
decent
stuff
not
impressive
but
definitely
solid
would
i
get
it
over
other
unibroue
beers
probably
not
but
i
sure
do
love
that
brewery
poured
a
bright
gold
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
foam
sticks
around
a
bit
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
to
the
end
light
smell
more
malt
than
hop
and
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
nice
and
light
with
no
bitterness
or
bite
this
beer
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
true
to
the
style
it
takes
no
risks
but
delivers
a
highly
drinkable
brew
just
an
all
around
excellent
wit
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
unibroue
offering
overall
this
is
very
simple
but
so
enjoyable
i
can
not
recommend
this
enough
o
a
really
well
developed
balnced
wit
on
the
shortlist
of
my
favorites
in
the
style
really
love
how
unibroue
gets
depth
of
flavor
yet
still
balance
in
their
beers
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
large
lasting
white
head
on
the
pour
aroma
and
taste
is
a
nice
citrusy
orange
peel
some
banana
pears
and
sweet
ripe
fruit
bouquet
with
some
light
wheat
malt
and
tartness
a
nice
light
to
med
body
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
clean
crisp
mouth
feel
finish
sweet
ripe
fruit
citrusy
orange
peel
banana
with
some
light
malt
and
fruity
tartness
overall
a
very
nice
fruity
and
flavorful
brew
ill
admit
that
i
am
a
big
fan
of
unibroue
beers
i
picked
up
this
bottle
out
of
my
fridge
simply
because
i
wanted
something
light
that
i
can
count
it
i
wasnt
even
planning
on
reviewing
it
the
mood
just
wasnt
there
but
after
the
first
sip
i
figured
that
i
do
need
to
record
a
note
about
it
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
this
beer
leans
more
towards
the
fruit
end
of
this
style
not
the
spicing
or
heavy
wheat
im
new
to
beer
so
im
no
pro
at
reviewing
beer
yet
i
would
agree
that
it
was
overall
a
nice
beer
to
drink
the
smell
was
good
had
a
very
pleasant
aroma
i
found
the
taste
to
be
average
the
carbonation
brought
a
new
interesting
feel
to
the
beer
it
was

drew
me
into

sits
a
top
this
brew
aromas
of
coriander
lemon
herbs
and
a
sour
smell
all
are
found
in
the
nose
the
flavor
is
crisp
with
a
complimenting
slight
acidity
orange
hint
of
coriander
apple
and
grainy
wheat
notes
are
in
the
taste
this
is
a
nice
straight
forward
example
which
really
is
what
this
style
is
all
about
a
perfect
beer
for
a
summer
afternoon
light
feel
crisp
and
very
effervescent
from
all
of
that
carbonation
another
good
one
from
unibroue
the
wit
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
large
quickly
dissipating
head
and
considerable
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
fruit
and
a
little
citrus
the
predominant
taste
is
the
wheat
with
some
spiciness
its
sort
of
like
bread
in
a
glass
in
a
good
way
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
thin
but
the
beer
goes
down
nicely
especially
on
a
hot
day
pours
into
the
glass
a
pale
and
cloudy
yellow
a
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
to
a
thin
layer
forms
on
top
nice
consistent
carbonation
throughout
the
aroma
gives
way
to
coriander
and
fruit
tones
the
taste
has
a
light
to
medium
creamy
body
a
complex
flavor
of
orange
coriander
and
pepper
unfold
what
a
great
witbier
this
could
easily
be
a
session
brew
this
also
paired
nicely
with
my
indian
food
another
great
offering
from
unibroue
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
good
frothy
head
that
lasted
the
whole
way
with
ok
lacing
the
smell
was
malty
lemony
citrus
and
fresh
the
taste
was
a
nice
blend
of
malt
and
hops
that
finishes
slightly
dry
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
end
mouthfeel
was
as
impressive
as
the
rest
of
the
beer
and
it
was
quite
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
lightly
cloudy
color
medium
sized
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
fair
lacing
there
is
some
good
carbonation
going
on
its
crisp
lemony
wheaty
very
malty
finishes
a
little
dry
and
spicy
i
thought
it
was
a
very
good
belgian
wit
beer
and
enjoyed
it
a
lot
this
is
one
of
unibroues
lower
alcohol
beer
its
a
good
wit
but
ive
had
better
pours
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
remains
smells
spicy
yeasty
and
citrusy
taste
is
of
dried
orange
or
orange
peel
some
spices
coriander
maybe
and
touches
of
mild
citrus
good
mellow
yeast
flavors
and
to
be
sure
that
mouth
numbing
unibroue
yeast
that
i
love
crisp
refreshing
and
very
very
drinkable
one
of
the
best
wits
around
poured
out
a
hazy
pale
yellowgold
color
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
smell
consisted
of
a
good
amount
of
orange
peels
and
spice
some
citric
notes
are
also
noted
in
there
taste
was
nice
lots
of
citric
notes
hit
the
palate
first
with
some
spice
mixing
in
but
its
not
overwhelming
in
the
spice
department
a
little
orange
peel
makes
its
way
through
for
the
undertones
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
espeically
for
a
wit
could
of
used
a
little
more
body
to
it
but
other
than
that
a
very
good
wit
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
massive
white
head
aroma
is
very
faint
but
i
perceive
a
note
of
wheat
taste
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
wit
very
clean
balanced
a
hint
of
clove
with
some
fruit
are
the
flavors
most
apparent
mouthfeel
is
nice
an
bubbly
and
drinkability
is
pretty
nice
not
my
favorite
wit
overall
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
from
unibroue
as
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
maybe
this
style
just
doesnt
do
it

me

the

a

the
aroma
is
good
it
boasts
of
belgian
pale

and
that

scent
that
i
love
there
seems
to
be
some
spices
in
here
as
well
the
taste
is
good
also
it
has
a
nice
light

taste
with
pale
malt
flavor
there
seems
to
be
some
spices
but
nothing
too
strong
the
mouthfeel
is

it
is
a

with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
brew
it
goes

it

a
beer
i
will
have
again

here
aroma
of

esers
bananas
tropical

and
some

taste
is
clean
and
flavorful
ther
eis
in

a

taste
in

background
here
some
slight
bready

and
some

at

of
things
very
carbonated

this
is
a
great

session
ale
low

lots
of
taste
good
stuff
the
smell
is
nice
full
of
flowery
citrus
the
flavor
is
decent
but
not
too
exciting
it
has
a
good
balance
of
sweetness
hops
and
citrus
the
finish
is
dominated
by
citrus
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
tasty
wit
that
was
quite
quaffable
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
and
it
was
a
good
choice
for
what
turned
out
to
be
a
warm
day
another
good
offering
from
the
folks
at
unibroue
poured
into
a
rapscallion
snifter
foamy
half
inch
virgin
white
head
formed
on
top
of
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
hued
liquid
some
lacing
more
like
a
slight
foam
that
hurries
to
rejoin
the
liquid
expected
white
nose
a
sharp
yet
wheaty
smell
initial
bite
to
the
flavor
then
mellows
out
to
a
nice
wellrounded
wheat
as
expected
a
worthy
brew
from
unibroue
great
taste
light
sweet
finish
this
beer
would
make
it
easy
to
drink
a
bit
too
many
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
straw
with
a
pretty
spritely
carbonation
smell
is
grainy
with
hints
of
spice
and
citrus
taste
is
pretty
light
on
the
spice
for
a
wit
not
nearly
the
orangycoriander
of
say
hoegaarden
the
spice
comes
in
at
the
very
end
a
bit
sweet
but
nothing
offensive
mouthfeel
is
fairly
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
more
refreshing
than
prickly
drinkability
is
good
and
this
would
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
summers
day
not
my
favourite
from
unibroue
but
still
a
pretty
good
beer
very
mild
and
drinkable
drinkability
very
refreshing
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
pours
a
hazy
orange
straw
type
amberish
color
with
a
white
head
which
leaves
before
its
time
fruity
indeed
this
brew
is
very
well
balanced
oranges
and
spice
and
some
yeasty
nice
i
enjoy
this
beer
much
much
more
on
tap
but
it
is
still
quite
good
bottled
wow
a
unibroue
with
a
low
abv
this
will
be
interesting
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
an
immense
tightlyknit
white
head
head
is
prolonged
and
leaves
sheet
lacing
down
the
glass
nose
is
fruity
and
floral
akin
to
other
unibroue
offerings
peppery
spices
and
valencia
oranges
occupy
the
nose
taste
is
dry
tart
slightly
yeasty
and
refreshing
dry
and
fizzy
in
the
mouth
very
drinkable
unusual
for
a
unibroue
but
i
like
this
one
not
as
complex
as
other
unibroues
but
i
like
it
as
a
welcomed
change
of
pace
this
stuff
aint
bad
but
aint
great
either
very
smooth
taste
without
much
flavor
very
fizzy
at
the
pour
diminishes
to
a
chunky
solid
white
head
this
tastes
like
i
imagine
the
macros
are
supposed
to
taste
easy
drinking
for
damn
near
everyone
and
a
bit
watery
i
really
didnt
care
for
it
at
all
on
the
second
bottle
i
found
subtle
differences
i
can
taste
a
definite
wood
flavour
in
this
bottle
as
well
as
other
slight
tastes
spectacular
this
difference
between
two
bottles
enough
to
add
nuances
and
complexity
without
risking
consistency
great
tasting
vast
drinkability
exquisite
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
wit
however
i
definitely
prefer
the
other
more
substantial
unibroue
offerings
pours
out
to
a
pastel
cloudy
yellowishgold
in
the
glass
with
a
good
sized
head
aroma
is
that
of
yeast
and
a
faint
spice
the
taste
shows
hints
of
clove
and
light
banana
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
quebec
quaffer
had
it
ontap
and
it
was
even
more
refreshing
but
would
not
be
ranked
as
high
as
the
bottle
poured
a
hazy
offyellow
colour
with
a
big
white
head
that
quickly
dissolved
the
nose
is
kinda
of
a
lemon
and
it
is
very
reminiscent
in
taste
to
la
fin
du
monde
for
a
lot
of
folks
i
dont
get
that
in
the
taste
but
a
lot
of
people
do
it
is
often
described
as
tart
and
the
aftertaste
is
one
of
sour
fruit
i
guess
thats
lemon
again
but
hey
blanche
de
chambly
is
as
they
say
easy
to
drink
and
full
of
good
tasting
flavour
i
like
this
beer
for
supper
this
beer
is
perhaps
not
as
complex
as
it
should
be
but
is
slightly
bracing
and
quite
refreshing
for
me
its
particular
lack
of
complexity
actually
increases
its
drinkability
i
consider
this
to
be
a
safetyblanche
something
to
drink
when
i
want
a
wit
but
dont
feel
like
being
challenged
yes
not
as
big
as
unibroues
other
beers
but
this
is
a
quality
wit
and
certainly
one
that
id
have
again
this
is
simply
an
average
beer
at
best
maybe
im
being
harsh
because
my
standards
are
so
high
from
any
unibroue
product
but
this
was
a
severy
disappointment
looked
way
too
thin
in
body
and
tasted
that
way
too
color
reminded
me
of
urine
pale
and
light
yellow
taste
showed
very
little
slight
breadiness
and
a
bit
of
spice
but
it
was
super
weak
a
bit
cloying
as
well
still
this
was
ok
but
not
any
better
than
that
great
representation
of
this
genre
and
very
drinkable
bien
sur
another
great
unibroue
beer
lots
of
carbonation
gives
this
pale
yellow
beer
a
great
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
long
lasting
film
very
cloudy
and
pale
aroma
was
fruity
and
yeasty
with
apples
very
pronounced
taste
was
a
touch
sour
tart
and
spicy
i
think
this
is
the
first
beer
i
really
like
better
with
the
yeast
swirled
in
the
nose
is
about
yeast
and
does
it
well
but
lightly
the
flavor
gives
hints
of
spice
and
also
creates
the
fruit
sense
called
for
the
feel
is
quite
good
lgiht
with
nice
crispness
at
the
end
drinkability
is
very
good
light
golden
brew
with
a
nice
foamy
white
head
that
stayed
on
for
a
while
sweet
refreshing
taste
with
a
fruity
aftertaste
good
unibroue
yeast
taste
this
is
one
of
the
very
good
witbier
better
then
hoegarden
but
not
to
the
level
of
blanche
de
bruges
overall
impression
well
made
but
mild
white
if
you
are
new
to
white
beers
this
may
be
a
mild
starting
point
but
i
like
my
whites
with
punch
this
has
more
of
a
mild
push
the
spices
are
close
to
the
rest
of
the
unibroue
beers
ive
tasted
i
would
up
the
citric
acids
go
heavier
with
the
spices
especially
the
coriander
and
think
about
another
yeast
strain
to
give
it
some
more
punch
this
beer
pours
with
an
almost
champagne
like
head
full
of
tiny
little
bubbles
i
belive
i
heard
somwhere
that
they
use
a
champagne
yeast
for
this
brew
there
is
a
slightly
sour
grassy
aroma
as
you
start
your
first
mouthfull
the
taste
dances
back
and
forth
across
your
tongue
at
first
sweet
then
sour
then
the
light
corriander
and
back
again
this
is
a
mavelous
beer
to
start
of
with
to
leave
the
mega
brew
world
drinkability

this
one
went
down
well
i
would
have
like
to
have
seen
a
little
more
flavor
but
a
good
witbier
nevertheless
overall
a
good
witbier
not
as
flavorful
as
an
allagash
white
imo
but
maybe
better
suited
for
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
this
is
probably
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
i
have
ever
had
great
session
beer
for
hot
and
humid
dc
summers
drinkability
will
stay
tasty
for
as
long
as
you
wanna
drink
em
good
flavor
intensity
makes
this
an
easy
session
pick
pours
to
a
pale
yellowish
color
with
a
white
head
it
has
a
spicy
wheat
aroma
maybe
coriander
or
orange
peel
it
also
has
a
bready
malt
aroma
the
flavor
is
also
bready
with
wheat
and
the
coriander
spice
flavors
it
is
a
light
bodied
easy
drinking
beer
one
of
my
favorite
unibroue
products
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
strong
foamy
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
smells
a
little
of
citrus
and
some
other
fruits
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
drinkable
very
sweet
and
enjoyable
the
fruits
are
very
good
but
the
main
flavor
comes
from
the
malts
hazy
golden
in
color
the
high
carbonation
keeps
a
thin
layer
of
head
for
quite
some
time
aroma
is
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
lots
of
coriander
in
the
taste
as
well
with
a
slight
sugary
sweetness
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
another
outstanding
beer
from
unibroue
there
is
an
awareness
of
a
witbier
aroma
slight
pepper
slight
clove
and
slight
moist
air
along
with
a
hint
of
orange
but
the
taste
is
way
too
subtle
to
be
interesting
theres
a
witbier
lurking
around
here
somewhere
but
its
too
timid
to
come
out
and
play
i
got
some
bubblegum
some
spice
and
some
wheat
but
in
a
murky
and
laid
back
manner
not
sure
what
unibroue
are
after
here
a
gentle
witbier
that
doesnt
offend
anyone
i
think
theres
a
big
difference
between
playing
safe
and
not
playing
at
all
medium
gold
color
small
head
apples
and
vanilla
aroma
malty
and
very
sweet
some
spiciness
not
very
hoppy
more
reminiscent
of
a
cider
than
a
beer
kind
of
applish
and
citrusy
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
spicy
tasty
but
not
very
beerlike
very
drinkable
beautiful
beer
at
first
this
poured
a
pale
yellow
tranparent
colour
then
the
yeast
falls
in
and
it
goes
to
a
pale
orange
two
finger
head
that
left
lacing
throughout
the
glass
smelled
of
spice
pepper
dried
fruit
and
wheat
tastes
reminds
me
of
a
wheat
field
some
floral
and
citrus
hops
orange
peel
dried
fruit
and
a
little
spice
coriander
and
yes
wheat
a
fluffy
light
mouthfeel
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
ah
very
good
beer
overall
another
great
beer
from
unibroue
one
of
their
lighter
beers
but
not
lacking
in
any
area
when
i
drink
this
beer
the
first
thing
i
think
of
is
just
how
remarkably
clean
and
crisp
it
is
the
color
that
perfect
nearly
translucent
pale
hazy
goldenalmost
pastel
if
golden
could
be
pastel
that
just
begs
one
to
the
well
the
nose
while
a
little
muted
offers
just
enough
anteseptic
spice
especially
clove
on
the
palate
the
beer
acts
like
a
sorbet
cleansing
the
palate
and
inviting
another
gulp
or
perhaps
the
next
course
i
like
to
drink
this
at
a
restaurant
bar
to
get
my
appetite
going
for
the
good
food
to
come
this
is
a
clean
as

is
tough

the

for

ol

pours
with
an
extremely
light
yellowish
tint
and
a
good
deal
of
haze
head
is
a
fairly
creamy
and
dense
aroma
is
pleasant
but
onedimensionally
citrus
and
not
nearly
as
powerful
as
some
other
wits
a
nice
spiced
flavor
that
presents
all
the
standards
lemon
coriander
and
maybe
a
little
banana
a
nice
clean
finish
rounds
it
out
its
very
well
carbonated
kind
of
like
drinking
a
witbier
sparkler
this
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
better
north
american
wits
the
smell
is
fruity
but
the
taste
has
more
of
a
citrus
quality
with
a
slight
biting
finish
crisp
light
and
dry
it
has
a
light
golden
color
that
is
a
little
cloudy
and
has
adequate
amount
of
carbonation
the
head
starts
out
well
but
dwindles
fairly
quickly
not
a
lot
of
strong
flavor
but
this
is
a
refreshing
summer
beer
with
pleasant
belgian
characteristics
this
brew
pours
a
light
cloudy
yellow
there
is
a
thick
but
fast
fading
head
on
top
of
the
beer
the
head
left
little
lace
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
citrus
and
yeast
the
taste
has
the
citrus
start
and
the
middle
is
a
bit
grainy
with
a
slightly
bittersour
finish
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
and
it
is
a
lightrefreshing
brew
and
went
down
smooth
after
getting
out
my
old
home
brew
bottles
for
scooter77
overall
a
slight
bit
above
average
i
whish
it
had
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
department
notesi
ordered
a
clonekit
of
this
beer
from
maltose
and
will
likely
add
a
pound
of
light
dme
and
decrease
the
carbonation
lets
see
how
it
turns
out
poured
from
a
750ml
brown
bottle
no
freshness
date
a
pale
cloudy
gold
it
had
a
big
white
head
to
start
off
with
but
it
soon
dissipated
yeasty
aroma
coriander
a
bit
of
citrus
orange
peel
small
amount
of
sweet
malt
flavour
is
light
and
spicy
coriander
seed
is
most
predominate
followed
by
a
bit
of
citrus
a
decent
white
but
not
the
top
offering
from
unibroue
still
a
decent
starter
for
those
who
have
yet
to
sample
their
line
it
gets
better
from
here
this
particular
brew
poured
a
large
white
foamy
head
with
finelarge
bubbles
that
quickly
dissolved
there
was
very
little
lacing
observed
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
there
was
a
slight
spicy
aroma
to
this
brew
the
body
was
pale
yellow
the
taste
was
smooth
thin
and
watery
in
my
opinion
this
belgian
white
lacked
character
as
there
was
nothing
special
about
it
this
brew
poured
a
very
large
head
of
fine
to
medium
sized
bubbles
that
receedes
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
it
has
a
cloudy
yellow
body
with
some
dark
somethings
floating
it
it
it
has
a
mild
malt
aroma
a
nice
smooth
start
with
a
slightly
tingly
mouthfeel
finish
very
clean
taste
that
is
unremarkable
not
bad
more
like
nothing
there
strangely
overall
i
still
liked
it
appearance
a
cloudy
light
yellow
consistent
champagne
like
bubbles
smell
is
light
and
lets
you
anticipate
what
the
flavor
will
be
like
taste
was
light
yet
refreshing
with
just
a
hint
of
tartness
similar
to
a
light
beer
but
with
a
lot
more
flavor
mouthfeel
was
smooth
just
a
tad
watery
but
the
flavor
kept
it
interesting
extremely
easy
to
drink
after
drinking
an
ipa
for
my
last
offering
the
contrast
was
great
recommend
especially
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
takes
some
getting
used
to
especially
for
those
who
are
new
to
the
style
this
is
one
of
my
first
true
white
beers
i
keep
wanting
to
gulp
it
its
quite
refreshing
quite
drinkable
but
there
is
something
offputting
about
its
lightness
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
review
after
i
have
had
more
of
this
style
of
beer
this
was
the
first
unibroue
product
i
have
sampled
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
very
disappointed
due
to
the
hype
and
positive
feed
back
i
have
heard
about
the
beers
that
this
canadian
brewery
produces
i
will
just
have
to
sample
the
five
unibroue
beers
i
have
waiting
in
my
cellar
hazy
yellow
pour
thick
white
and
longlasting
head
which
laces
nicely
aroma
is
yeasty
malty
some
banana
lemon
and
hint
of
vanilla
flavor
is
mainly
banana
some
bubblegum
sneaking
in
and
a
bit
of
vanilla
sliding
in
at
the
end
medium
body
lively
carbonation
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
typical
spices
of
the
wit
style
pours
a
thick
very
foamy
head
slowly
settles
down
unevenly
looks
good
pale
yellowish
very
light
rich
hearty
aroma
smells
of
wheat
not
as
lemony
as
many
others
tastes
good
feels
a
little
scooty
in
the
mouth
not
bad
but
not
as
crisp
as
some
others
pleasant
wheat
aftertaste
but
its
a
little
funny
somewhat
bitter
going
to
enjoy
this
one
but
im
not
going
to
rush
for
another
f
drinkability
very
high
belgianstyle
wits
are
one
of
my
favorite
brews
to
turn
to
in
the
summer
heat
and
humidity
when
heavier
and
stronger
beers
would
make
me
drop
i
could
drink
glass
after
glass
of
this
i
guess
people
around
here
really
dont
care
for
wits
because
this
is
a
mark
above
hoegaarden
blue
moon
and
other
wellknowns
oh
well
color
is
a
golden
pale
yellow
slightly
hazy
with
a
tight
bubbly
head
of
frothy
foam
thats
bumpy
and
about
three
fingers
high
smell
is
lemonyorange
with
a
bit
of
spicyness
to
it
its
quite
the
sniffer
very
strong
taste
is
more
of
the
same
lemonyorange
sweet
with
a
slight
spicyness
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
wheat
grain
its
got
a
light
spritzer
wine
feel
and
hold
thats
very
citrusy
and
slightly
drying
with
a
dry
spiceness
its
a
good
belgian
style
wheat
that
resembles
some
triples
its
mostly
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
and
tart
with
a
good
citrusy
kick
drinkable
indeed
but
watch
out
for
the
sneaky
5
beer
pours
cloudy
but
light
with
a
good
deal
of
setiment
slight
head
which
retains
good
lace
my
real
problem
with
the
beer
was
its
lacklustre
taste
i
was
much
more
bland
to
me
than
the
big
two
white
beers
allagash
and
hoe
tasted
a
bit
watery
when
compareed
to
those
still
very
drinkable
and
a
great
one
to
have
if
you
just
love
white
beer
having
tasted
unibroues
fin
du
monde
i
was
expecting
a
lot
out
of
this
beer
i
bought
5
liter
cask
on
a
whim
and
drank
it
with
two
friends
in
one
sitting
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
and
a
beautiful
sight
to
behold
a
glimmering
golden
cloud
when
held
in
the
light
a
very
yeasty
beer
especially
the
dregs
of
the
cask
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
i
would
definitely
take
an
alagash
white
or
a
hoe
over
this
stuff
just
not
as
exciting
as
id
hoped
it
would
be
the
taste
was
citric
but
kind
of
boring
it
had
a
bit
of
a
novelty
appeal
coming
in
a
cask
but
if
i
had
it
to
do
all
over
again
id
probably
just
spend
my
money
on
a
few
big
bottles
of
fin
du
monde
which
is
a
better
beer
for
its
style
this
is
an
extremely
light
and
refreshing
beer
from
the
folks
at
unibroue
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
light
airy
head
which
leaves
a
thin
lace
that
clings
to
the
side
of
the
glass
aromas
of
citrus
and
yeast
are
detected
flavors
of
lemon
orange
and
mild
hops
are
quite
apparent
there
was
a
mild
citrus
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
if
you
enjoy
the
crispness
of
wits
you
will
definitely
like
this
one
it
has
pale
malts
with
breads
throughout
most
of
the
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
nice
and
dry
with
lightly
toasted
white
bread
the
flavoring
of
this
beer
was
weak
i
expect
a
lot
from
unibroue
because
of
their
excellence
in
their
brews
and
this
was
a
little
bit
of
a
let
down
in
the
flavor
category
it
is
a
good
drinker
crisp
and
clean
it
is
just
a
bit
boring
because
of
the
lack
of
complexity
we
had
no
problem
finishing
this
little
cask
but
no
doubt
i
would
have
enjoyed
this
more
had
it
been
july
instead
of
march
overall
this
was
a
solid
white
beer
but
not
the
best
ive
had
and
definitely
not
the
best
unibroue
has
to
offer
the
smell
is
strong
very
spicy
with
some
citrus
the
front
is
very
briefly
sweet
and
almost
dominated
by
the
classic
unibroue
spice
it
turns
suddenly
dry
with
a
light
middle
the
alcohol
is
noticeable
the
finish
is
crisp
and
just
a
little
watery
the
aftertaste
is
bitter
freshened
by
alcohol
overall
its
a
good
beer
the
spice
dominates
the
other
good
flavors
can
i
put
a
slice
of
orange
in
this
yeah
i
just
got
back
from
canada
and
brought
3
bottles
of
unibroue
750ml
la
fin
du
monde
maudite
and
blanche
de
chambly
that
i
picked
up
for
5
bucks
canadian
how
great
is
that
well
in
comparison
the
12
oz
bottle
this
one
appears
a
deeper
golden
haze
with
same
yellow
frothing
head
leaves
a
collar
of
lace
around
the
head
but
no
lace
is
forming
evenly
througout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
full
of
spices
banana
and
a
slightly
citrus
tone
is
also
present
very
pleasant
the
flavor
is
wheat
based
with
many
complements
tantalizing
the
taste
buds
at
the
same
time
such
as
a
bubbly
sharp
sweetness
of
citrus
mellowed
by
spices
and
a
banana
flavor
created
by
the
yeast
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
similar
to
some
seltzer
water
with
the
high
carbonation
but
after
having
this
mussels
steamed
in
this
the
other
night
at
smokeless
joes
i
cant
get
enough
of
it
overall
very
drinkable
beer
that
sits
up
there
with
the
best
witbier
in
the
world
my
hoegaarden
very
drinkable
especially
on
tap
and
just
as
easy
to
drink
out
of
the
bottle
solid
belgian
style
wit
here
for
all
to
enjoy
if
youve
never
tried
a
wit
before
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
then
try
a
wittekerke
i
have
never
tasted
a
witbier
from
the
united
states
that
comes
even
close
to
this
beer
fabulous
a
true
session
beer
very
nice
offering
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
as
to
my
expectations
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
straw
color
and
formed
a
bubbly
white
head
that
subsided
leaving
trace
lace
a
small
amout
of
carbonation
was
present
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
hops
lemon
and
spice
the
flavor
was
light
and
crisp
with
elements
of
citrus
and
grain
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
for
this
style
but
not
to
the
level
that
you
would
expect
from
this
brewery
this
beer
poured
to
a
nice
flurry
merangue
head
and
after
swirling
in
the
yeast
had
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
its
smell
was
of
fresh
lemon
floral
fruits
and
a
yeasty
backbone
the
taste
followed
suit
with
a
nice
clean
and
refreshing
start
that
opened
up
lemon
and
citrus
flavors
and
a
nice
wheaty
presence
the
mouth
feel
was
nice
and
full
for
this
light
style
and
drinkability
is
fantastic
get
me
going
with
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
a
cook
out
and
you
might
have
to
wheel
me
home
they
go
down
effortlessly
i
love
hoeggarden
by
the
bottle
and
even
better
on
tab
at
my
local
tap
room
but
this
has
to
be
my
second
favorite
wit
beer
and
will
make
the
rotation
i
only
wish
it
was
priced
lower
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
is
an
averahe
beer
from
a
stellar
brewery
maybe
i
have
just
come
to
expect
to
much
from
these
guys
the
beer
looks
lager
with
a
thicker
white
head
and
a
bit
more
carbonation
the
smell
is
the
usual
for
the
style
without
a
really
strong
coriander
kick
the
taste
has
a
more
mellow
citrus
flavor
than
i
would
prefer
and
overall
the
flavor
department
just
seems
thin
not
very
drinkable
because
of
these
negatives
12
oz
bottle
from
the
same
source
as
my
last
unibroue
debacle
no
worries
here
though
pale
yellow
color
foamer
of
a
head
sticky
white
to
beige
bubbles
laced
the
glass
nicely
this
one
is
clearly
not
past
its
prime
nice
hop
inspired
citrus
smell
taste
follows
very
tart
puckering
snap
to
it
subtle
spices
creamy
sweet
malt
in
the
middle
full
bodied
for
such
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
only
the
slightest
trace
of
tart
fruit
taste
lingers
very
good
way
up
on
my
list
as
a
summer
refresher
a
small
notch
below
allagash
white
and
better
than
the
others
in
its
class
nevertheless
quite
exceptional
the
feel
is
a
tad
thin
possibly
because
of
the
somewhat
low
alcohol
content
also
leaves
a
thin
filmy
aftertaste
but
isnt
so
bad
kind
of
plain
i
must
say
not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
i
was
a
tad
disappointed
considering
the
other
unibroues
i
have
had
great
smell
but
very
very
champagne
like
in
all
characteristics
id
definitely
have
it
again
though
but
cant
see
myself
putting
good
money
towards
it
champagnelike
in
appearance
clear
gold
and
effervescent
with
a
billowy
perfectly
white
head
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
light
grapefruit
notes
and
a
light
spicy
hoppiness
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
crisp
and
tingly
with
a
light
feel
flavor
contains
a
light
graininess
understated
hops
a
hint
of
banana
and
a
tart
citric
fruitiness
finish
is
dry
and
longlasting
i
tried
this
with
and
without
the
yeast
and
found
that
it
has
a
bit
more
depth
and
body
with
a
good
wit
opaque
grapefruit
juice
color
creamy
head
od
14
of
an
inch
not
as
large
as
some
little
lacing
a
white
wine
grape
nose
some
prickly
pepper
smells
starts
off
very
fruity
grape
lots
of
lemon
and
some
cider
qualities
thins
mid
mouth
and
finishes
somewhat
dry
with
carbonation
some
sense
of
pineapple
especially
in
the
aftertaste
overall
pretty
reserved
in
flavor
profile
a
little
tight
to
my
tongue
with
some
reminders
of
carbonated
water
of
the
unibroues
this
is
the
most
ordinary
but
then
wits
are
rarely
my
style
well
this
is
quite
a
contrast
to
the
winter
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
but
thats
not
such
a
bad
thing
not
at
all
a
hazy
whitegolden
body
forms
inside
of
the
curved
glass
and
a
thick
white
foam
quickly
takes
over
atop
it
dont
pour
this
one
hard
aroma
of
strong
spices
and
dried
fruit
very
nice
pepper
clove
and
raisin
to
be
exact
as
for
the
palate
its
surprising
that
this
beer
is
so
flavorful
having
such
a
light
body
the
spicy
products
of
the
yeast
pepper
and
clove
are
dominant
dried
fruit
is
underneath
malt
is
present
but
quite
subtle
hops
are
more
noticeable
and
add
a
bit
to
the
spiciness
just
a
few
banana
esters
in
there
very
well
done
beer
perfection
for
a
wit
quite
drinkable
definitely
a
session
beer
or
a
summer
refresher
should
also
pair
easily
with
fine
foods
i
was
out
with
the
wife
at
a
french
restaurant
when
i
spied
this
on
the
menu
i
ordered
it
and
they
delivered
it
with
a
glass
with
a
lemon
sacra
bleau
after
i
discarded
the
lemon
chased
by
the
pleasing
hop
spiciness
the
aftertaste
long
lasting
and
quite
dry
with
a
very
white
head
nice
floral
aroma

you
add

that
the

this

the

this
would
be
perfect

but
i
will
enjoy
this
on
a
mild

in

if
the

flavor
to
a
really
nice

that
i

this

is
one
note
just
as
advertised
for
those
who
enjoy
beer
like
this
it
may
be
great
but
just
not
for
me
poured
very
nicely
light
head
a
bit
thin
feeling
for
a
wheat
beer
my
experience
is
nearly
identical
to
tectactoes
it
had
thin
sharp
taste
for
a
wheat
as
well
with
a
crisp
slightly
citrus
flavor
every
time
i
took
a
sip
i
was
trying
decide
if
i
liked
it
but
it
did
fall
into
the
okay
category
for
me
enjoyable

flavorful

with

and
better
than
references
such
as
hoegaarden
meh
medium

slightly
over

with

this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
that
has
a

of
yeast
character
that
stands
up
to
the
citrus
worth
trying
and
a
must
for
wheat
beer
fans
i
wonder
what
the
vitamin
c
content
is
in
this
brew

in

phases
of
a
sip
dry
and
somewhat
tannic
but
very
fruity
flashes
of
watermelon
and
golden

in
there
amongst
the
citrus
and
phenolicestery
yeast
some
banana
going
on
light
to
moderate
body
with
carbonation
quite
tame
finish
is
dry
with
some
green
resinous
hops
apparent
although
the
bright
citrus
flavor
carries
on
through
to
the
end
nicely
phenolic
with
some
clove
becoming
more
assertive
over
time
enjoyable
even
if
the
citrus
is
rather
too
dominant
in
the
overall
flavor
profile
im
kind
of
getting
a
typical
brash
americian
hegemony
thing
emanating
from
this
one
do
they
get
all
the
metrics
correct
sure
is
it
drinkable
you
bet
yer
ass
is
it
anywhere
near
as
subtle
and
complex
as
the
worldbeaters
for
the
style
fuck
no
i
dont
know
how
to
express
that
with
a
boston
accent
note
this
is
how
i
remember
hoegaarden
original
tasting
before
it
got
bought
out
by
a
multinational
and
watered
down
to
the
point
of
silliness
i
was
expecting
much
more
based
on
their
good
reviews
overall
nothing
special
ok
light
beer
fruit
but
much
more
to
say
id
skip
it
o
good
solid
representation
of
the
style
more
bitter
and
less
watery
than
a
hoegaarden
this
is
worth
a
go
but
drink
it
in
summer
not
in
winter
like
me
prost
good
but
nothing
special
spices
were
overdone
could
have
been
a
little
more
balanced
a
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
one
that
proved
far
too
easy
to
drink
its
relatively
simple
would
usually
be
a
bad
thing
but
it
works
very
well
in
this
case
with
the
citrus
fruits
orange
complimenting
the
coriander
and
wheat
flavours
this
one
tastes
as
a
witbier
should
and
is
definitely
one
worth
picking
up
overall
not
bad
again
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
based
beers
hefes
wits
etc
but
this
is
pretty
decent
nice
spices
that
get
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
on
the
flavor
but
still
nice
great
orange
and
zest
nit
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
dry
finish
decent
creamy
wheat
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
pretty
solid
beer
generally
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
wasnt
bad
if
i
went
out
and
someone
had
this
on
tap
i
may
get
it
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
overall
quite
a
tasty
witbier
very
clean
and
refreshing
i
dont
think
it
has
quite
enough
over
the
standard
witbier
to
justify
the
price
but
hey
still
a
damn
good
beer
pours
very
cloudy
there
is
a
lot
of
sediment
here
although
it
suspends
nicely
with
a
good
aggressive
swirl
taste
is
lightly
sweet
faint
fruit
taste
as
youd
expect
nice
and
refreshing
no
edge
to
it
at
all
really
enjoyable
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
summery
beer
of
course
the
alcohol
wasnt
that
heavy
here
which
lead
to
this
going
down
faster
than
it
should
have
while
beers
of
this
style
tend
to
be
light
and
easygoing
this
could
have
been
a
bit
more
heavy
and
bold
citrus
lovers
might
want
to
substitute
this
for
a
glass
of
orange
juice
but
now
that
the
spring
is
here
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
to
be
found
on
your
local
retailers
shelf
only
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
clown
shoes

overall
refreshing
ill
probably
save
the
other
two
bottles
i
got
for
the
summer
dont
think
ill
go
buy
more
though
not
bad
not
stellar
decent
othis
beer
was
good
like
the
smell
and
taste
o
recommended
especially
to
citrus
lovers
is
clementine
in
there
probably
im
not
exactly
sure
what
that
tastes
like
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
hazy
with
continually
rising
effervescence
a
bubbly
head
but
no

with
citrus
and
spice
light
and
crisp
yeast
citrus
pith
and
coriander
brought
to
a
head
with
a
steely
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
this
brew
is
heavy
on
the
citrus
but
light
on
spices
and
orange
flavor
its
tangy
taste
is
reminiscent
of
orange
zest
rather
than
slices
the
beer
is
more
like
a
good
lager
with
orange
zest

i

it
was

theres
something
i
really
like
about
this
beer
it
was
enjoyable
right
now
in
the
winter
so
i
can
just
imagine
enjoying
this
in
the
springsummer
a
very
decent

would
go
quite

and
clean

im
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
or
the
ibus
but
they
claim
to
throw
in
summit
hops
usually
a
green
vegetable
note
my
belief
with
their
house
yeast
is
to
keep
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
whats
left
is
a
light
drinkable
beer
that
clown
shoes
will
sell
by
the
tone
however
i
will
set
it
straight
this
is
not
a
hoppy
american
wheat
ale
but
its
solid
highly
carbonated
wheat
that
i
enjoyed
due
to
the
clementine
orange
peel
and
spice
additions
overall
go
and
drink
some
and
form
an
opinion
for
yourself
clown

version
of
a

is
a
success
just
the
beer
you
need
to
smack

had

and
very
smooth

a
very
enjoyable
offering
overall
i
wasnt
that
into
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
very
average
example
of
the
style
all
of
the
aspects
of
this
beer
seemed
pretty
average
and
there
wasnt
anything
about
it
that
separates
it
from
all
the
other
average
witbiers
this
beer
had
decent
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
not
filling
but
the
flavor
didnt
really
hold
my
attention
and
i
think
it
would
really
start
to
wear
on
me
after
drinking
more
than
one
so
i
think
one
would
be
my
maximum
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
orange
aspect
it
wasnt
bad
and
it
didnt
seem
to
be
artificial
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
i
think
it
needs
some
work
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
since
it
really
doesnt
stick
out
for
the
style
and
its
a
little
overpriced
for
what
you
get
i
would
only
recommend
this
beer
to
someone
who
really
likes
this
style
all
in
all
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
there
wasnt
anything
about
it
that
made
it
a
memorable
witbier
better
luck
next
time
guys
hoppy
feet
is
still
my
least
favorite
clown
shoes
beer
but
this
one
wasnt
too
much
better
im
still
not
sure
about
this
brewery
and
i
think
it
might
be
hard
for
them
to
compete
against
the
local
michigan
brewerys
good
witbier
with
the
clementine
being
a
slightly
different
take
on
the
stereotypical
organize
you
get
with
a
lot
of
other
similar
beers
has
this
poured
out
of
the
big
boy
bottle
into
the
weizen
glass
the
color
is
a
hazy
darker
yellow
lighter
mouthfeel
as
one
would
expect
for
the
style
liked
it
has
a
twofinger
fluffy
white
head
pale
gold
and
fizzy
smells
of
melon
green
apple
lemon
grass
and
sugar
tastes
sweet
and
spicy
with
faint
notes
of
coriander
malt
peppercorn
apple
juice
lemon
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
complex
and
welcoming
can
and
do
coexist
here
light
bodied
mostly
dry
but
soft
in
the
middle
and
smooth
sailin
all
the
way
a
resounding
meh
could
be
heard
each
time
i
took
a
sip
of
this
beer
its
one
of
those
not
bad
but
not
exactly
good
type
of
things
its
just
well
its
nothing
special
it
has
all
been
done
before
and
clementine
doesnt
do
anything
to
stand
out
and
make
me
want
to
drink
it
again
huge
fans
of
the
style
might
enjoy
it
but
i
wont
be
taking
it
out
for
a
second
date
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
color
tge
head
iw
one
inch
of
frothy
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
a
quatern
inch
that
sits
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
coriander
and
cardamom
forward
which
i
like
and
has
a
nice
fruity
wheaty
thing
going
on
in
the
background
which
has
some
nice
peach
and
tangerine
qualities
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
balanced
between
the
fruit
and
the
spice
it
is
very
full
flavored
for
a
witbier
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
chewy
texture
and
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
i
will
drink
it
again
overall
an
ok
wit
a
little
heavy
on
the
spice
fairly
good
beer
but
not
really
worth
it
at
clown
shoes
prices
thought
it
was
straight
forward
and
well
made
f
short
bite
from
the
wheat
and
fruity
orange
flavors
that
end
up
with
a
clean
finish
overall
great
summer
beer
refreshing
citrus
flavor
im
glad
i
tried
it
a
second
time
good
solid
version
and
nice
for
this
heat
we
are
in
overall
a
good
first
impression
from
clown
shoes
definitely
a
well
crafted
beer
but
just
not
the
right
interpretation
for
me
i
am
sure
that
this
is
an
older
bottle
no
matter
though
it
still
works
the
beer
is
fairly
clear
with
a
golden
orange
color
nose
is
definitely
wit
but
not
very
strong
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
orange
with
spice
accents
easy
to
drink
and
i
feel
like
it
is
more
of
a
belgian
ale
instead
of
a
wit
but
it
works
overall
a
really
easy
drinking
wit
lots
of
flavors
but
still
refreshing
i
dig
it
ok
but
doesnt
do
anything
different
or
especially
well
at
a
premium
price
overall
ive
always
been
a
fan
of
this
brew
and
brewer
clementine
doesnt
necessarily
do
anything
differently
than
most
witbiers
they
just
do
it
all
right
among
the
best
if
not
the
best
domestic
witbiers
ive
had
very
afforadable
and
just
an
extremely
well
rounded
beer
pours
a
hazy
deep
straw
color
with
a
smallish
bubbly
white
head
that
persists
for
a
while
smells
of
clove
and
allspice
with
a
sweet
light
sugary
malt
base
and
a
light
lemony
tart
spicy
wheat
twang
the
flavor
is
sweet
honey
and
sugar
with
a
bunch
of
clove
and
lemony
orange
with
a
tart
wheaty
edge
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
sweet
mouthfeel
not
my
favorite
style
and
not
my
cup
of
tea
stylistically
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
this
one
has
clashing
flavors
imho
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
spices
yeast
and
some
citrusy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
citrus
zest
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
just
an
ok
beer
cant
say
this
is
any
better
than
a
blue
moon
now
this
is
what
im
talking
about
strong
fruity
flavors
but
still
finishes
with
hops
not
too
intense
but
light
enough
that
its
a
great
summer
beer
and
extremely
drinkable
a
great
example
of
how
to
brew
a
witbier
and
finally
ive
found
an
american
brewery
that
can
do
it
well
with
some
identity
compared
to
the
german
breweries
the
taste
falls
a
little
flat
very
estery
pretty
sweet
oddly
dry
finish
not
a
lot
of
citrus
in
the
beer
overall
it
is
an
ok
beer
but
the
overpowering
yeastiness
makes
the
beer
at
times
feel
solventy
i
dont
think
id
have
it
again
tasty
wheat
brew
with
a
ton
of
citrus
funk
the
pour
is
cloudy
and
bright
sunshine
color
glowing
loudly
with
a
tall
white
head
with
excellent
retention
the
nose
is
real
orangey
i
cant
specify
clementines
exactly
but
maybe
tangerines
or
some
kind
of
orange
zesty
more
than
juice
in
the
smell
with
some
sour
sainsonesque
yeast
the
flavor
is
equally
interesting
with
the
orange
throughout
bitter
and
acidic
at
the
end
the
yeast
is
more
spicy
than
i
think
it
needs
to
be
as
the
fruit
would
be
more
enjoyable
as
a
standalone
dominant
note
in
this
one
but
i
appreciate
the
use
of
something
non
generic
somewhere
between
a
saison
and
a
hefeweizen
i
think
here
its
a
cool
take
on
this
style
the
wheat
malt
provides
some
body
but
its
flavor
is
outshined
by
the
fruit
solid
feel
a
little
too
sturdy
from
the
sediment
to
be
as
refreshing
as
it
might
otherwise
be
but
the
carbonation
is
awesome
and
the
finish
is
really
cool
with
the
acidic
sting
of
the
orange
peel
and
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
itself
combined
with
a
funky
yeast
overall
a
very
pleasing
beer
at
a
fair
price
this
is
one
i
will
look
forward
to
trying
again
if
warm
weather
ever
comes
back
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
will
definitely
pick
up
more
the
next
time
i
see
it
on
the
shelf
o
i
thought
it
was
a
good
wit
beer
and
was
glad
to
take
a
stab
at
it
medium
bodied
and
very
heavily
carbonated
with
a
strong
peppery
spice
presence
that
lingers
over
the
citrus
and
yeast
notes
into
a
dry
finish
theres
a
very
strong
coriander
flavor
that
dominates
slightly
overpowering
the
citrus
peel
and
bread
notes
peppery
with
subtle
orange
and
tangerine
notes
tart
dry
finish
not
bad
but
the
overpowering
coriander
makes
this
beer
a
bit
onenote
needs
some
more
citrus
sweetness
to
balance
things
out
i
bought
a
large
22oz
bottle
of
this
and
poured
into
a
large
pint
glass
very
citrusy
smell
hence
the
name
clementine
this
had
more
of
an
organgy
citrus
taste
as
opposed
to
some
other
belgians
which
taste
more
lemony
this
pours
to
a
hazy
yellow
color
seems
to
be
unfiltered
and
about
13
of
white
head
and
23
liquid
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
awesome
tasting
witbier
one
of
the
best
domestics
not
sure
about
the
other
clown
shoes
beers
but
this
one
is
excellent
o
overall
i
would
call
this
beer
drinkable
and
pretty
good
if
i
had
a
wild
hair
i
would
scoop
this
beer
up
again
but
it
definitely
isnt
something
that
i
would
seek
out
tastes
nice
though
refershing
would
be
lovely
on
a
summer
day
o
a
good
american
wit
that
has
some
nice
citrus
mostly
orange
and
spice
mostly
coriander
character
fairly
easy
to
drink
worthy
of
a
try
pours
hazy
straw
colored
with
a
tall
white
head
that
dissipates
at
a
moderate
pace
there
are
visible
large
and
tiny
bubbles
in
this
beer
the
beer
mostly
smells
of
orange
which
works
as
advertised
i
also
detected
the
wheat
and
some
mild
spiciness
in
the
aroma
the
orange
flavor
is
not
as
strong
in
the
flavor
as
it
was
in
the
nose
but
it
does
blend
very
nicely
with
the
wheat
malt
theres
some
mild
spiciness
in
the
taste
as
well
which
was
detectable
in
the
nose
there
are
some
clove
black
pepper
and
nutmeg
flavors
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
not
entirely
clean
due
to
a
spicy
aftertaste
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
good
beer
overall
what
we
liked
best
about
this
one
was
the
nose
the
fruit
was
there
and
so
was
the
spice
but
we
lost
both
in
the
flavoring
the
mouth
was
overly
boozy
despite
a
standard
abv
and
the
orange
was
sadly
absent
this
booze
even
crowed
out
the
typical
warming
spice
of
wits
making
for
an
overly
bitter
onedimensional
offering
this
cam
off
a
lot
more
like
a
german
hefeweizen
than
a
belgian
wit
either
way
its
a
tasty
wheat
beer
this
beer
pours
a
really
hazy
clouded
blur
with
a
raging
carbonated
fizzle
that
hisses
at
you
as
you
pour
the
color
reminds
me
of
a
white
grapefruit
juice
with
the
pulp
still
in
but
the
head
dissipates
almost
instantly
while
the
carbonation
continues
to
pockmark
the
surface
with
a
torrent
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
thick
with
that
clementine
and
orangelike
smell
alongside
the
proper
wheatfunk
and
a
slight
bananalike
smell
seems
to
be
there
as
well
alongside
some
faint
spices
the
beer
tastes
bananalike
with
nice
undertones
of
citrus
clementine
and
orange
kind
of
like
a
bananacitrus
smoothie
with
some
wheat
cloying
and
cream
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
after
taste
is
light
with
citrus
while
the
mouthfeel
is
really
rough
with
carbonation
and
fiercely
dry
on
the
top
of
the
tongue
with
faint
bubbling
still
tingling
the
tops
of
the
mouth
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
of
a
citrus
burst
from
this
beer
but
overall
it
just
seems
like
a
strong
citrus
backbone
on
a
white
belgian
ale
overall
its
not
a
terrible
beer
just
not
quite
what
i
was
hoping
for
and
not
wholly
memorable
overall
definite
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
when
you
want
a
pure
thirst
quencher
has
a
nice
light
taste
despite
an
above
average
alcohol
content
the
clementine
taste
shows
up
with
the
finish
and
isnt
over
powering
shortcoming
is
drinkability
having
more
than
one
or
two
in
one
sitting
would
be
rare
but
this
beer
would
make
a
nice
compliment
to
a
tuna
burger
or
a
spring
salad
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
not
my
favorite
wit
but
the
subtle
earthy
not
juicy
or
artificial
clementine
flavor
is
pretty
cool
the
wit
is
too
clean
for
the
style
theres
not
enough
belgian
spice
coriander
vanilla
or
the
like
its
more
just
a
smooth
slightly
sweet
candied
wheat
beer
not
a
bad
wit
and
certainly
interesting
worth
a
try
for
something
different
this
taste
much
like
a
tripel
with
a
lower
alcohol
content
its
as
if
they
took
their
tramp
stamp
and
laid
off
of
the
hops
this
has
none
of
the
traditional
witbier
notes
theres
no
wheat
notes
lemon
or
orange
and
there
no
coriander
a
little
disappointing
for
the
style
but
not
bad
overall
if
this
were
a
belgian
pale
ale
it
would
be
a
pretty
solid
beer
o
overall
it
lacked
the
added
punch
i
expected
as
its
essentially
just
a
standard
wit
with
a
little
more
spiciness
and
a
very
nice
aftertaste
but
somewhat
bland
outside
of
that
a
pour
mouthfeel
tipped
me
over
the
edge
and
dropped
it
lower
as
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
went
from
thinking
it
was
kind
of
good
to
very
average
o
i
believe
this
is
good
for
the
style
but
for
me
eh
maybe
only
again
on
tap
maybe
i
tried
this
too
late
note
to
self
try
this
again
fresher
next
time
after
having
just
had
a
elder
betty
from
magic
hat
it
was
interesting
to
taste
another
big
fruit
beer
this
one
wins
for
the
remarkably
nice
sudsy
and
creamy
mouthfeel
on
the
sweet
and
spicy
side
if
youre
in
the
mood
from
the
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
chalice
a
hazed
tangerine
color
with
a
nicely
formed
12
finger
white
head
atop
alot
of
yeasty
phenols
in
the
nose
mixed
coriander
spiceed
notesiam
not
sure
if
i
have
come
across
a
wit
with
that
much
of
a
yeasty
phenolic
presence
flavors
have
a
nice
clementine
orange
presence
upfront
then
the
yeasty
phenolic
spiced
flavors
really
pretty
much
take
overa
light
smattering
of
coriander
in
the
finish
its
not
bad
but
its
a
little
yeast
heavy
handed
in
my
opinion
o
very
good
witbier
straightforward
but
solid
would
certainly
try
it
again
also
paired
well
with
a
spicy
dish
my
first
clown
shoes
brew
a
refreshing
summer
witbier
with
saison
yeast
character
low
abv
and
exceptional
drinkability
ill
take
this
with
me
during
a
hot
weather
outing

overall
not
bad
its
almost
summer
here
in

which
means
scorching
already
and
my

beers
i
mean
lighter
than
imperial

this
is

ill
reach
for

out

with
a
faint

of

was
more
akin
to
biting
into
a
not

and
getting
a
bit
of
the
white
rind
as
well
backed
by
bready
and
lightly
spicy
yeast
bitter
to
an
extent
medium
bodied
bubbly
and
some
lingering
sweetness
overall
there
was
a
lot
of
fruit
but
ive
had
juicer
beers
that
used
only
hops
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
nice
orange
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
wheat
and
citrus
with
the
wheat
dominating
has
a
very
sweet
taste
mainly
citrus
but
the
wheat
is
dominating
and
compliments
the
citrusy
taste
which
is
probably
from
the
hops
carbonation
is
right
for
this
light
bodied
beer
that
goes
down
very
smooth
overall
a
good
beer
o
clown
shoes
really
hit
a
home
run
with
this
one
to
my
mind
it
managed
to
stay
light
while
still
packing
in
the
flavor
very
nice
o
overall
nice
beer
good
to
have
around
when
the
warm
weather
comes
around

its
bordering
on

is
some

light

clean
and
very
crisp
its
tart

citrusy
all
the
way
through
theres
a
little
orange

bitterness
at

it
lingers
faintly
after
the

this
would
be
an
outstanding
warm

brew
it
actually
quenches
my
thirst

ridiculously
easy

interesting

unusual
sour
lambic
type
flavors
surrounded
by
orange

bottled
lemon
juice
and
coriander
mouthfeel
is
on
the
astringent
side
due

ingredients
overall
it
was
off
and
weird
but
interesting
and
not
bad
lighter
medium
body
slightly
higher
carbonation
bubbly
and
refreshing
on
the
tongue
this
was
good
but
i
felt
like
i
was
still
searching
for
something
more
after
finishing
my
glass
light
bodied
with
excellent
carbonation
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
beer
as
expected
the
body
is
light
and
playful
having
an
almost
seltzer
water
feel
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
fizzy
which
assists
in
the
drinkability
tremendously
a
slightly
foamy
swallow
hinders
the
crispness
of
the
beer
slightly
but
isnt
terrible
medium
bodied
this
beer
coated
my
tongue
a
little
bit
definitely
dry
and
lightly
carbonated
whew
this
may
have
been
an
infected
bottle
or
just
past
its
prime
but
something
was
not
right
about
this
beer
it
looked
fine
enough
orangebrown
color
with
a
thin
wispy
head
typical
wheat
profile
on
the
nose
mixed
with
trash
and
rotten
orange
peels
taste
was
stale
and
harsh
more
rotten
orange
clementine
skunk
funk
mulch
and
old
bitter
hops
the
bottle
date
indicated
it
was
only
a
couple
months
old
and
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
beer
could
go
that
bad
that
fast
maybe
this
one
is
just
a
miss
for
me
average
mouthfeel
but
more
or
less
undrinkable
drain
pour
a
fairly
nice
witbier
with
classic
flavors
of
spice
and
orange
peel
and
nice
refreshing
bitterness
overall
pours
golden
perhaps
a
bit
darker
than
most
and
with
good
clarity
perhaps
too
good
i
like
my
wit
a
little
cloudy
this
looks
like
a
euro
lager
in
the
glass
a
decent
head
with
some
lacing
as
well
nice
tangerine
aromas
and
a
hint
of
spice
very
pleasant
the
taste
has
that
same
bright
tangerine
note
along
with
quite
a
striking
bitterness
from
the
hops
definitely
an
american
hybridization
the
wit
notes
are
lost
a
bit
in
the
hop
presence
but
its
all
good
still
quite
tasty
overall
not
quite
as
refreshing
as
it
could
be
but
i
think
more
aprihop
than
wit
here
is
the
goal
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
an
effervescently
carbonated
and
clear
yellow
gold
surges
beneath
a
bone
white
head
grassy
floral
zest
sour
citrus
and
crisp
wheat
malt
blend
here
nicely
in
an
aroma
that
hints
at
a
refreshing
brew
smooth
lemon
citrus
and
honey
flavors
glide
down
the
palate
after
being
introduced
with
a
mild
bitterness
up
front
and
refreshingly
bright
malt
body
to
follow
this
has
seafood
bbq
on
a
hot
day
written
all
over
it
o
a
very
drinkable
and
citrus
beer
definitely
a
warm
weather
drink
overall
this
a
nice
example
of
a
witbier
nice
flavor
and
mouthfeel
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
at
all
and
although
not
terribly
interesting
to
think
about
it
does
seem
to
hold
pretty
true
to
the
general
style
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
dense
white
head
that
settles
to
a
soapy
cap
crisp
aromas
of
citrus
and
wheat
malt
dominate
with
a
touch
of
spicy
coriander
banana
and
grassy
hops
pretty
spoton
with
the
nose
the
spice
really
jumps
out
nicely
bitter
in
the
finish
decent
amount
of
banana
as
well
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
light
body
and
sharp
carbonation
overall
a
solidly
refreshing
wit
excellent
as
a
cooldown
after
work
overall
while
not
the
best
out
there
its
one
of
my
goto
beers
cheap
tasty
and
easy
drinking
not
bad
its
a
good
characterful
take
on
the
style
and
for
that
it
may
be
worth
picking
up
again
overall
it
still
seems
to
have
held
up
rather
well
and
was
kind
of
mad
that
it
was
this
old
still
a
great
brew
overall
clementine
in
the
glass
has
a
light
golden
look
with
some
specs
of
hazed
orange
as
well
a
cap
of
white
stuff
with
moderate
lacing
smell
is
ripe
off
the
tap
with
wheat
some
citrus
and
orange
at
the
forefront
some
faint
pale
malt
in
the
back
taste
is
a
wheat
beer
on
the
fruitier
side
some
faint
orange
peach
clementine
flavor
with
wheat
and
a
touch
of
coriander
feel
is
pretty
light
bodied
with
a
nicely
done
up
carb
i
could
go
for
a
pint
of
this
in
the
summer
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
compared
to
other
witbiers
it
has
a
lot
more
citrusy
flavors
and
a
bit
of
acidity
alcohol
seems
hotter
than
6
old
lady
was
kind
of
meh
on
it
too
neither
of
us
identified
anything
that
was
an
off
flavor
but
it
is
easily
worth
1
25
a
beer
so
it
gets
another
half
notch
on
the
overall
scale
o
a
really
easy
to
drink
beer
and
a
nice
thirst
quencher
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
another
pleasant
offering
from
clown
shoes
i
have
been
impressed
with
this
brewery
thus
far
this
beer
is
quite
sessionable
and
i
will
look
forward
to
quaffing
quite
a
few
come
the
springsummer
though
i
will
have
to
trek
into
ny
to
purchase
this
one
it
started
out
with
a
nice
frothy
2
finger
white
head
reduced
to
a
thin
ring
minimal
lacing
very
cloudy
looked
like
a
glass
of
grapefruit
juice
flavors
rolled
nicely
off
the
tongue
wheat
citrus
coriander
grass
pepper
slightly
tart
and
dry
but
very
smooth
carbonation
was
spot
on
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
left
me
wanting
another
o
overall
a
pretty
good
witbier
honestly
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
consider
this
to
be
in
competition
with
allagash
white
its
pretty
simple
like
most
witbiers
but
very
tasty
and
very
refreshing
something
throws
up
a
citrusy
bitterness
on
the
end
not
unlike
orange
juice
not
sure
if
this
is
from
hops
or
orange
peel
maybe
both
has
a
pithy
mild
sweetness
which
gives
it
an
interesting
smoothbitter
interplay
that
is
pretty
refreshing
and
unique
i
like
it
not
to
mention
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
wit
this
beer
does
a
good
job
of
standing
out
in
a
style
where
many
versions
are
very
similar
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
spin
on
the
style
i
like
it
and
would
try
this
again
a
nice
summertime
or
anytime
thirst
quencher
bright
flavors
with
a
crisp
finish
thanks
to
mduncan
for
the
suggestion
gearing
up
for
a
clown
shoes
tasting
in
the
store
so
i
figured
id
get
more
acquainted
with
their
beers
myself
this
one
pours
a
lightly
hazy
golden
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
lemon
zest
lightly
tart
tangerine
black
pepper
clove
and
a
twist
of
ruby
red
grapefruit
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
but
as
powerful
as
the
citrus
is
the
spices
are
the
stars
now
black
pepper
clove
cardamom
even
a
touch
of
coriander
for
the
sake
of
it
its
powerfully
spicy
lemme
tell
ya
but
i
think
it
works
here
right
on
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
a
wet
feel
and
a
dry
finish
deal
with
that
people
overall
a
very
nice
wit
a
different
take
than
ive
encountered
lately
what
with
the
inyourface
spices
but
definitely
a
welcome
changeofpace
overall
nothing
special
ok
light
beer
fruit
but
much
more
to
say
id
skip
it
overall
interesting
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
liked
it
and
would
purchase
again
wife
liked
it
yay
tastes
like
it
smells
only
with
a
little
peng
of
super
sweet
citrus
near
the
very
end
which
becomes
quickly
overrun
by
more
whitepepper
this
is
maybe
the
most
peppery
wit
ive
ever
had
also
maybe
the
hoppiest
its
a
true
belgian
rendition
of
the
style
though
and
the
clementine
citrus
acts
as
only
a
mild
accentuation
of
the
other
flavors
instead
of
as
a
cheap
sideshow
quite
wonderfully
brewed
actually
pours
a
cloudy
milky
gold
with
a
one
finger
head
that
sticks
around
aroma
of
coriander
and
oranges
taste
follows
nose
coriander
and
other
spices
up
front
orange
in
the
back
very
feint
thicker
than
other
wits
this
is
good
but
not
great
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
o
a
tasty
well
made
beer
nice
belgian
yeast
hay
and
citrus
aroma
belgian
citrus
flavor
and
very
bitter
slight
hop
finish
it
is
very
unique
id
probably
never
buy
again
in
a
bottle
and
glad
i
didnt
get
the
bomber
but
id
get
it
if
i
saw
it
on
tap
im
not
saying
i
dont
like
but
there
are
better
wits
out
there
but
id
drink
it
if
you
handed
it
to
me
and
enjoy
it
overall
good
not
great
but
very
unique
bomber
from
half
time
poured
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
lasting
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
yeast
orange
zest
and
coriander
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
and
crisp
flavors
of
wheat
yeast
coriander
and
ligt
orange
zest
with
a
crisp
lingering
citruscoriander
finish
i
didnt
notice
any
clemintine
character
just
seemed
like
a
decent
wit
beer
to
me
the
body
is
a
little
heavier
than
i
would
like
for
a
wit
and
the
carbonation
is
good
overall
this
one
is
solid
but
not
generally
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
wit
overall
a
good
wit
beer
thats
very
easy
drinking
and
hid
the
abv
so
well
that
youd
think
this
was
a
light
beer
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
liked
this
one
so
much
that
i
ordered
a
second
good
flavor
well
balanced
even
keeled
overall
an
odd
little
number
not
really
a
traditional
witbier
at
6
and
with
a
hop
kick
that
even
7
months
in
is
substantial
it
doesnt
have
the
massive
refreshing
character
that
traditional
wits
do
but
as
a
strong
wit
or
even
a
double
wit
a
style
i
normally
hate
this
is
pretty
darn
tasty
i
dont
remember
what
the
price
was
i
think
around
5
bucks
for
the
bomber
but
id
likely
pick
this
up
again
when
the
mood
for
something
a
bit
different
strikes
but
the
wheat
base
needs
some
more
tender
loving
care
and
the
mouth
feel
has
all
kinds
of
carbonation
issues
i
really
have
no
reason
to
return
to
this
offering
oi
just
keep
thinking
that
a
good
white
ale
should
have
some
citrus
notes
but
you
should
not
be
hammered
over
the
head
with
them
i
will
stick
with
my
allagash
white
best
witbier
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
the
yeast
the
most
important
part
of
a
good
wit
is
top
notch
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
event
thought
there
should
be
snow
on
the
ground
and
not
this
crazy
warm
weather
here
in
boston
the
sweetness
from
the
wheat
hits
first
with
a
strong
followup
of
coriander
and
spicy
phenols
added
from
the
belgian
yeast
light
velvety
body
with
a
sharper
carbonation
this
beer
is
a
great
refreshment
especially
in
the
summer
pours
out
a
hazy
orange
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
stands
two
and
a
half
fingers
tall
head
eventually
recedes
to
a
frothy
cap
leaving
loads
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
is
greeted
with
orange
and
spice
the
taste
backs
up
what
the
nose
experienced
with
lots
of
orangecoriander
and
a
nice
hop
presence
to
balance
it
out
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
bubbly
with
a
short
dry
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
i
feel
that
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
white
ale
should
be
a
decent
mild
witbier
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
pretty
decent
looking
white
head
on
top
that
sticks
to
the
glass
fairly
well
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
citrusy
aromas
along
with
the
wheat
softness
coming
though
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
doesnt
have
too
much
of
a
fruit
flavor
like
i
thought
it
might
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
overall
this
brew
is
a
good
summer
beer
for
sure
o
where
did
these
guys
come
from
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
by
them
and
the
second
to
make
my
jaw
drop
i
can
only
hope
the
rest
of
their
lineup
is
just
as
stellar
o
this
beer
is
very
nice
and
different
i
have
never
had
a
beer
with
so
much
orange
taste
and
its
very
tasty
this
is
a
great
beer
when
you
get
tired
of
your
typical
beer
overall
a
nice
thirstquencher
at
an
awful
price
opinion
well
unfortunately
this
wit
didnt
really
do
it
for
me
i
think
that
the
lack
of
carbonation
was
the
biggest
flaw
so
that
is
one
of
the
easier
ones
to
fixchange
i
do
like
that
the
spicesadditions
arent
overdone
though
the
coriander
is
noticeable
it
isnt
hot
as
it
gets
in
some
witbiers
you
try
the
short
and
sweet
is
that
i
havent
given
up
on
this
beer
i
would
like
to
try
it
again
on
tap
where
the
carbonation
can
be
controlled
better
and
then
decide
a
clearish
gold
with
well
carbonated
slow
dieing
head
on
top
of
a
clovey
orange
peel
smell
with
some
coriander
and
yeast
twang
minot
hoppy
touch
as
well
light
bodied
beer
that
follows
the
nose
as
a
smooth
passing
but
not
watery
brew
flow
of
orange
peel
spices
coriander
not
cider
but
some
type
of
plush
fruit
sweetness
that
are
well
balanced
pass
my
tongue
and
then
theres
a
slightly
tartdry
and
crisp
finish
i
wouldnt
say
this
is
my
fave
of
this
style
or
the
best
but
for
some
reason
i
am
really
drawn
to
this
one
o
i
like
it
and
it
is
a
nice
witbier
for
citrus
lovers
if
thats
your
thing
then
pick
this
up
o
a
good
drinkable
witbeer
certainly
not
the
best
to
be
found
but
also
certainly
not
the
worst
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
o
was
a
little
let
down
with
the
strong
orangespicy
taste
and
smell
a
bit
on
the
bitter
end
of
the
scale
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
not
searching
the
streets
either
average
overall
a
decent
witbier
that
i
wouldnt
ever
oppose
drinking
but
it
certainly
would
not
be
first
choice
in
the
style
flavor
is
dominated
by
oranges
more
coriander
and
unknown
earthy
spicing
pleasant
enough
wit
but
nothing
really
special
there
is
not
much
here
the
flavors
that
do
show
up
vanish
in
a
second
which
makes
this
very
unsatisfying
nothing
particularly
wrong
just
blah
and
ho
hum
not
something
i
am
coming
back
to
o
not
really
much
witbier
character
to
this
wasnt
a
big
fan
overall
a
great
overall
beer
that
makes
it
so
easy
to
drink
would
buy
this
again
overall
the
taste
seemed
a
little
watery
as
the
spice
and
fruity
notes
fades
other
than
that
it
was
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
would
have
another
overall
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
we
made
careful
selections
in
pour
order
to
prevent
something
overpowering
it
but
in
the
this
just
wasnt
one
of
my
favorites
poured
a
hazy
gold
into
the
glass
with
one
finger
of
head
that
quickly
disapated
with
little
lacing
smell
was
heavy
on
fruit
and
spice
carbonation
medium
and
a
medium
body
as
well
the
taste
was
surprisingly
heavy
on
the
hops
it
has
a
bit
of
that
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
that
isnt
usual
in
a
witbier
not
horrible
but
not
as
clean
finishing
as
id
like
o
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
one
the
flavors
and
the
mouthfeel
arent
exactly
what
they
should
be
for
a
witbier
appearance
is
a
light
golden
tone
with
a
one
finger
head
the
nose
of
this
wit
has
orange
or
perhaps
clementine
and
coriander
its
taste
has
some
pepper
light
hops
more
orangecitrus
a
bit
of
yeast
too
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
with
a
nice
dry
finish
this
wit
drinks
easily
and
is
quite
tasty
i
wish
they
distributed
this
in
ct
this
is
a
damned
solid
representation
of
the
style
there
is
some
odd
lemon
plus
phenol
character
that
just
makes
me
think
of
cough
drops
still
not
uncommon
for
the
style
really
one
trick
flavor
if
there
could
be
a
bit
more
complexity
somewhere
that
would
be
nice
o
i
must
admit
i
am
impressed
with
this
one
its
a
solid
brew
in
every
category
and
one
id
love
to
pick
up
again
on
a
hot
day
if
it
felt
more
like
a
wit
id
probably
bump
this
category
up
to
4
5
but
its
a
little
off
for
a
wit
and
it
is
going
to
get
all
4s
instead

carbonation
being
moderate
overall
a
pretty
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
it
definitely
had
more
citrusy

juicy
flavors
then
most
wits
but
it
worked
pretty
well
with
the
other
flavors
overall
pretty
enjoyable
beer
overall
overall
a

a

beer
not
something
id
make
a
habit
of
getting
but
i
could
revisit
this
on
a
moments
notice
without
any
reservations
odclown
shoes
does
it
again
was
mildly
unimpressed
by
the
nose
but
the
flavor
really
hit
the
spot
this
brewing
company
makes
some
impressive
brews
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
o
this
is
a
good
beer
doesnt
remind
me
of
other
white
ales
but
a
good
beer
unique
in
that
not
many
breweries
can
pull
off
incorporating
big
citrus
into
a
beer
that
traditionally
only
features
moderate
citrus
but
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
white
ale
without
the
citrus
just
add
some
lemongrass
and
it
might
be
more
enjoyable
it
adds
something
im
just
not
sure
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
d
ive
had
a
few
offerings
from
clown
shoes
all
really
enjoyable
but
this
hasnt
been
my
favorite
maybe
expected
a
little
too
much
overall
good
beer
overall
with
all
the
hype
around
clown
shoes
lately
i
figured
id
pick
up
what
was
available
this
is
the
first
one
ive
triedreviewed
and
it
didnt
disappoint
definitely
worth
a
shot
overall
a
good
hoppy
wit
that
makes
me
want
to
try
more
from
the
brewery
highly
recommend
if
you
are
open
to
something
a
little
different
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
got
from
ummagum
in
chicago
rotation
if
avail
near
me
id
get
the
occasional
bomber
oy
good
orangey
aroma
and
flavor
sweet
clementine
bah
bah
bah
not
bad
has
alot
of
great
elements
has
some
odd
elements
but
i
dug
it
this
was
a
12
ozer
grabbed
a
bottle
because
of
some
recent
highbrow
opinions
that
in
my
opinion
did
not
advance
the
mission
of
beer
advocacy
but
essentially
were
a
personal
ratfuck
attack
on
the
brewer
so
i
am
going
to
drink
more
of
their
beer
and
support
the
local
little
guy
i
shop
at
his
store
often
and
will
now
buy
his
beer
more
often
bravo
clown
shoes
overall
i
would
have
to
say
that
clown
shoes
clementine
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
perfect
summer
time
beer
if
you
enjoy
a
nice
white
ale
then
i
highly
recommend
giving
this
beer
a
try
overall
this
is
pretty
ordinary
for
a
witbier
and
hardly
tastes
like
one
either
but
it
does
get
better
as
it
warms
up
that
i
will
admit
this
brew
pours
a
nice
hazy
straw
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
that
quickly
drop
down
aroma
is
great
theres
the
typical
citrus
zest
and
coriander
of
a
wit
but
with
a
hoppy
kick
in
there
to
keep
things
interesting
the
taste
is
great
its
a
perfectly
balanced
witbier
that
provides
nice
orange
zest
coriander
yeast
and
hop
flavors
they
all
work
in
perfect
harmony
creating
a
nice
wit
thats
quite
a
bit
more
interesting
than
the
average
one
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
and
more
oily
than
id
like
drinkability
is
superb
overall
a
superlative
american
witbier
if
there
ever
was
one
o
overall
this
is
another
enjoyable
brew
from
clown
shoes
i
havent
had
one
of
their
beers
yet
that
i
havent
liked
recommended
for
a
quaffable
beer
on
a
warm
day
overall
clementine
is
a
win
for
me
it
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
nice
hot
summer
day
if
you
want
to
drink
a
beer
which
is
refreshing
good
tasting
and
not
too
heavy
as
to
weight
you
down
many
thanks
to
nuggethops
for
the
chance
to
review
this
one
after
a
pretty
aggressive
trip
to
costco
in
90
degree
and
rainy
weather
a
nice
witbier
seemed
like
a
good
choice
poured
into
my
dfh
snifter
pours
a
murky
yelloworange
color
bright
white
head
small
bubbles
tons
of
carbonation
smell
coriander
lemon
peel
clove
just
so
refreshing
taste
definite
hops
presence
a
really
nice
bitterness
crisp
orangelemon
zest
flavors
coriander
light
spices
mouthfeel
tons
of
carbonation
makes
for
a
really
dry
finish
works
well
for
the
style
drinkability
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
perfect
to
cool
down
with
after
a
nice
hot
day
a
darn
good
witbier
and
the
second
solid
beer
ive
had
from
clown
shoes
this
beer
may
be
a
touch
too
strong
to
quaff
on
a
hot
day
but
everything
else
about
it
is
very
nice
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
rest
of
this
brewerys
lineup
recommended
i
get
excited
when
i
see
this
beer
on
tap
at
a
bar
and
that
is
how
a
great
beer
should
make
you
feel
enjoyable
light
and
the
label
isnt
offensive
o
a
surprisingly
good
witbier
that
is
almost
like
a
belgian
ipa
good
flavors
and
a
surprisingly
strong
hop
presence
that
blends
well
with
the
flavors
definitely
one
of
the
better
witbiers
out
there
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
cap
sweet
candy
roma
with
slight
yeastiness
sweet
allover
but
with
a
hop
finish
unepected
a
little
yeast
lemon
grass
and
banana
pretty
diverse
flavor
profile
medium
bodied
great
carbonation
really
nice
summer
brew
overall
the
sum
is
greater
than
the
parts
on
this
one
and
factoring
in
the
drinkability
it
gets
a
5
a
great
summertime
thirst
quencher
and
a
very
fairly
priced
bomber
also
can
we
talk
about
this
brewers
name
clown
shoes
probably
the
greatest
thing
since
sliced
bread
looking
forward
to
checking
out
the
rest
of
their
lineup
o
this
one
is
okay
hoppy
feet
and
hoppy
feet
1
5
blew
me
away
but
this
one
is
just
meh
lacks
flavor
for
me
o
this
beer
accomplishes
what
it
states
on
the
label
a
refreshing
easy
to
drink
summertime
brew
if
you
like
wits
with
a
focus
on
orangecitrus
flavors
try
this
beer
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
like
a
summer
beer
should
be
light
and
smooth
around
the
mouth
and
tongue
overall
overall
this
is
my
favorite
fruit
infused
white
ale
on
the
market
it
has
a
very
smooth
creamy
feel
to
it
through
and
through
and
delicious
spice
citrus
and
sweet
notes
too
definitely
a
great
go
together
with
all
things
summer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
orangeyellow
nice
bubbly
white
head
that
left
patches
all
over
light
and
refreshing
citrusy
notes
with
a
crisp
lemonyearthy
hop
aroma
hint
of
wheat
twang
flavor
could
be
more
assertive
but
this
is
a
nice
summertime
drink
orange
peel
bitterness
is
slight
but
noticed
in
the
finish
smooth
carbonation
for
a
light
crisp
beer
the
taste
is
simple
and
pleasant
soft
citrus
flavors
mixed
well
with
mild
toasted
malts
and
a
good
yeast
profile
very
sessionable
and
a
slight
chalky
palate
worth
buying
again
but
nothing
spectacular
that
puts
this
wit
ahead
of
all
the
rest
d
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
wittbier
from
clown
shoes
definitely
a
fruitier
example
of
the
styles
but
the
bops
keep
it
in
check
this
was
my
first
dive
into
this
newest
and
it
has
left
me
wanting
more
overall
a
nice
witbier
luckily
there
seem
to
be
others
around
that
i
like
but
i
would
probably
pick
this
up
from
time
to
time
if
it
were
available
in
ct
3
5
d
aside
from
the
taste
which
is
mediocre
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
of
course
the
taste
is
most
important
so
take
that
however
you
want
d
perfect
after
working
outside
all
day
tasty
summer
beer
o
very
well
executed
beer
overall
orange
pairs
well
with
this
style
and
if
youre
going
to
add
fruitessence
you
might
as
well
do
it
successfully
this
beer
achieves
that
quite
good
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
there
is
so
much
going
on
the
malt
backbone
really
lets
the
flavors
shine
through
there
is
a
nice
spice
like
a
belgian
blonde
some
nice
citrus
orange
and
a
creamy
smoothness
that
all
blends
well
together
a
really
nice
beer
to
have
out
on
the
deck
on
a
summer
day
and
watch
the
sun
set
with
witbiers
tend
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
this
one
is
no
different
i
enjoy
the
larger
presence
of
orange
which
adds
a
refreshing
citrus
element
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
summer
drinking
the
aroma
was
on
the
lighter
side
of
things
lots
of
spices
wheat
and
grass
like
smells
coming
together
nicely
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
or
orange
peels
in
there
as
well
brightening
it
up
very
nicely
the
flavor
was
superb
for
the
style
lots
of
coriander
and
spices
running
through
it
a
touch
of
clove
and
an
almost
banana
like
flavor
in
the
middle
lots
of
fresh
grass
as
well
in
the
finish
wonderful
body
on
this
one
was
chewy
most
of
the
time
and
really
just
came
across
very
well
great
carbonation
kept
it
lively
throughout
22
oz
bottle
date
late
april
2011
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
thick
head
and
decent
lace
the
smell
is
fairly
complex
i
detect
orange
bananas
spice
coriander
and
a
pleasant
bready
smell
the
taste
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
you
can
actually
taste
a
hint
of
clementine
as
well
as
a
pithy
orange
flavor
and
then
a
good
bit
of
spice
and
a
light
wheat
body
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
more
dry
than
most
wheat
beers
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
of
yard
work
overall
well
it
has
good
flavor
for
a
witbeer
but
its
a
witbeer
refreshing
with
a
nice
flavor
and
quite
a
good
aroma
but
not
anything
jawdropping
cant
knock
this
beer
its
very
good
for
the
style
im
very
interested
in
trying
their
other
offerings
o
a
tasty
if
not
extraordinary
version
of
the
style
definitely
refreshing
oa
great
summer
brew
easily
enjoyed
in
the
sweaty
months
i
wish
my
cup
holder
on
the
riding
mower
was
big
enough
to
hold
a
bomber
i
wish
clownshoes
would
put
their
stuff
in
cans
o
really
like
this
one
the
citrus
character
is
awesome
and
everything
in
good
balance
drinks
great
o
i
havent
enjoyed
a
wit
this
much
in
a
long
time
this
was
refreshing
and
tasty
as
hell
even
if
it
is
a
bit
different
im
very
eager
to
try
more
from
these
guys
overall
a
good
beer
maybe
not
a
classic
witbier
flavor
but
the
orage
addition
is
imaginative
and
works
pretty
well
a
good
summertime
refreshing
beer
paired
extremely
well
with
a
homemade
breakfast
scramble
and
a
peach
jam
covered
english
muffin
typically
hoppy
belgians
arent
my
thing
and
this
certainly
isnt
within
the
bounds
of
the
wit
style
but
it
is
still
wellintegrated
playing
the
hops
and
the
orange
peel
off
of
each
other
nicely
a
nice
intro
to
this
brewerys
beers
nailed
the
style
and
then
some
unfiltered
look
a
little
banana
and
yeasty
good
lacing
spicyness
from
cloves
and
corriander
cinammon
and
grains
of
paradise
and
yes
clementineorange
taste
above
average
mouthfeel
a
nice
one
thanks
dr
jay
for
sending
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
nicely
spiced
but
nothing
spectacular
i
guess
i
just
dont
get
all
the
hullabaloo
about
this
brewery
prost
tangy
orange
spicy
coriander
notes
some
very
minor
leafy
hops
summit
on
the
label
surface
in
the
middle
full
bodied
with
a
dry
aftertaste
of
coriander
that
lingers
smooth
wheaty
body
spicing
isnt
overdone
and
the
bomber
is
no
problem
to
finish
the
orange
notes
are
slightly
bittersweet
more
peel
and
pith
than
fruit
fairly
straightforward
but
with
an
interesting
complexity
a
nice
warm
weather
refresher
that
ill
return
to
hopefully
will
see
this
on
tap
around
town
d
a
really
good
american
wit
unfortunately
the
weathers
been
pretty
shitty
the
past
few
days
so
im
not
as
in
the
mood
for
a
light
refresher
as
i
otherwise
might
be
ill
have
to
try
this
again
in
the
summer
very
good
drinker
would
seek
out
again
see
it
as
an
excellent
fit
to
warmer
weather
with
grilled
fish
and
vegetables
comes
out
an
extremely
hazy
unfiltered
honey
color
thin
amount
of
head
with
a
solid
ring
around
the
glass
the
nose
hits
you
with
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
a
good
amount
of
coriander
and
orange
zest
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
the
yeast
again
some
banana
and
coriander
that
is
usual
with
a
white
but
a
good
amount
of
the
clementine
zest
there
is
some
hop
dryness
and
a
faint
bitterness
that
pops
out
at
the
very
finish
a
very
light
body
with
a
lot
of
that
american
2row
caramel
along
with
a
heavy
amount
of
carbonation
refreshing
the
cpj
drinkability
is
good
could
have
better
feel
but
the
flavor
and
light
body
will
make
me
pick
this
up
again
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
god
lighter
belgianstyle
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
whole
evening
i
will
try
this
agin
when
hot
outside
seems
to
be
what
it
was
designed
for
highly
drinkable
this
would
be
a
great
summer
time
thirst
quencher
i
enjoyed
this
beer
for
its
color
and
drinkability
although
i
wanted
the
citrus
to
shine
a
bit
more
than
it
did
looks
nice
hazy
peach
with
a
bright
white
cap
about
a
half
inch
of
foam
coated
the
beer
lingered
for
quite
a
while
and
was
a
bit
clingy
sour
wheat
aroma
hit
my
nose
first
followed
by
yeast
and
coriander
oranges
low
bitterness
with
the
same
characters
as
in
the
aroma
a
little
breadier
and
slightly
herbal
spicy
finish
with
some
lingering
citrus
and
wheat
medium
to
light
bodied
a
little
heavier
than
i
expect
in
a
witbier
a
bit
soapy
in
texture
with
lively
carbonation
i
liked
it
and
would
pick
it
up
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
some
nice
character
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
arent
as
robust
or
witlike
as
the
nose
up
front
is
bitter
with
just
a
slight
fruit
profile
the
finish
is
very
dry
and
crisp
and
doesnt
have
the
wheaty
profile
im
looking
for
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
seems
really
well
made
for
what
it
is
but
it
doesnt
taste
much
like
a
traditional
witbier
at
all
a
bit
too
much
orange
peel
for
me
but
still
a
very
good
domestic
rendition
of
the
style
pours
a
nice
looking
pale
orange
with
a
decent
pearl
white
head
average
lacing
and
retention
big
orange
notes
in
the
aroma
definitely
lives
up
to
the
name
a
little
disappointed
that
the
nose
didnt
come
through
more
in
the
flavor
had
a
pretty
standard
wheat
flavor
profile
but
with
a
minor
infusion
of
clementines
tasty
and
drinkable
the
feel
of
this
beer
seems
light
at
first
but
then
takes
on
a
bigger
shape
toward
the
back
bigger
then
some
witbiers
this
goes
down
easy
but
has
a
small
aftertaste
that
starts
to
get
slightly
puckering
but
then
is
gone
an
interesting
summer
time
beer
d
excellent
drinkability
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
would
suit
anyone
looking
for
a
break
from
the
norms
of
this
style
big
tower
of
seafoam
head
cloudy
yellow
with
a
very
active
carbonation
spiciness
of
coriander
and
hops
with
orange
peel
and
yeast
are
blatantly
obvious
in
the
nose
rolling
crispness
off
of
a
fluffy
medium
body
all
the
right
facets
are
here
orange
peel
and
coriander
with
a
light
bready
malt
flavor
slight
tartness
evens
the
playing
field
but
the
yeast
does
distract
a
bit
more
than
needed
with
some
chalkiness
in
the
end
coriander
turns
around
and
drops
some
bitterness
along
with
the
herbal
hop
for
a
pulling
semidry
finish
a
good
take
on
the
style
not
over
spiced
and
well
balanced
aside
from
the
overtone
of
yeast
the
beer
is
almost
orange
and
is
beautifully
hazy
with
a
thin
quickly
receding
head
it
smells
of
fresh
dough
oranges
and
clementines
the
taste
matches
with
some
pleasant
bitterness
coming
through
great
mouthfee
smooth
and
silken
and
even
more
drinkable
this
is
an
easy
drinking
belgian
style
ale
well
balanced
and
not
overly
spiced
d
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
its
among
the
best
witbiers
ive
had
and
id
certainly
have
it
again
all
it
really
needs
is
a
bit
more
punch
in
the
flavor
department
very
refreshing
too
d
goes
down
easily
quite
tasty
not
too
filling
nice
kick
and
nice
representation
of
style
im
enjoying
everything
that
i
come
across
with
this
brewery
md
medium
bodied
very
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
for
sure
overall
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
d
if
i
could
buy
a
16
barrel
of
this
in
il
i
would
drink
this
all
year
round
its
that
good
notes
a
big
bold
white
ale
an
interesting
interpretation
and
i
like
the
added
bitterness
but
dont
find
it
obtrusive
drinkability
a
great
dessert
beer
to
me
this
is
like
a
blue
moon
if
you
remove
the
bitterness
and
amp
up
the
sweet
citrus
this
is
what
i
envision
the
style
to
be
i
would
get
this
again
a
very
good
beer
this
beer
poured
to
be
a
golden
yellow
with
an
orange
tint
it
had
an
inch
or
so
of
frothy
head
with
moderate
carbonation
the
smell
was
very
strong
of
citrusorange
lemon
or
assumably
clementines
there
was
also
a
spicy
aroma
it
was
lightmedium
bodied
and
was
crisp
and
smooth
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
i
have
not
tried
much
from
the
style
but
its
good
but
im
not
overwhelmed
by
it
id
say
try
it
if
you
have
access
and
like
light
session
beers
d
really
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
a
complex
and
full
bodied
witbier
a
decent
beer
wasnt
too
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
but
it
was
pretty
solid
d
just
a
really
nice
refreshing
witbier
curtousy
of
clown
shoes
out
of
the
four
beers
these
guys
brew
i
dont
think
they
make
a
bad
one
each
one
has
its
own
little
spin
on
it
and
flavor
assault
the
strength
of
clementine
oranges
really
makes
this
one
pop
a
very
well
done
beer
love
the
citrus
plus
hops
flavor
definitely
could
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
warm
day
this
was
fun
and
enjoyable
pourd
a
1
head
and
showed
lots
of
carbonation
turmoil
in
the
glass
light
applejuice
yellow
good
smell
of
orange
and
citrus
which
carries
through
on
the
palette
refreshing
and
very
easy
drinking
summer
beer
minimal
hops
and
not
much
zing
to
it
md
a
nice
lively
mouthfeel
and
overall
tasty
not
supersmooth
but
a
witbeer
with
these
flavors
doesnt
have
to
be
a
nice
beer
ok
clown
shoes
youve
set
the
bar
continue
to
make
some
good
beers
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
solid
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
really
fruity
clementine
orange
peel
and
witbier
yeast
aroma
its
light
and
dry
with
just
the
right
amount
of
citrus
character
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
light
wheat
flavor
with
loads
of
citrus
orange
peel
and
clementines
its
dry
as
hell
but
the
yeast
adds
a
nice
fruity
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
wit
the
clementines
add
excellent
fruit
character
that
melds
nicely
with
the
yeast
esters
and
bitter
orange
peel
d
a
decent
fruity
witbier
lots
of
citrus
and
orange
in
the
smell
and
taste
wouldnt
seek
out
again
but
would
give
another
shot
if
someone
had
a
bottle
strong
wheat
flavor
from
the
start
to
the
finish
of
the
taste
theres
also
some
metal
to
the
finish
the
aftertaste
is
short
lived
and
has
an
iron
flavor
to
it
the
body
is
typical
the
carbonation
is
low
the
combination
gives
the
sense
of
a
thicker
beer
than
it
really
is
the
swallow
has
a
nice
bitterness
from
hops
the
aftertaste
has
a
mild
sourness
considering
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
it
really
impressed
like
an
allagash
white
with
more
of
a
citrusy
kick
to
it
drinkability
i
wasnt
crazy
about
the
hopforward
addition
to
this
one
but
i
could
see
how
someone
would
like
it
certainly
very
good
though
great
job
i
like
the
flavor
of
this
beervery
light
for
summer
drinking
and
crisp
on
tap
at
armsby
abbey
in
worcester
being
a
cloudy
orange
brew
this
one
looks
more
like
a
hefe
than
a
true
wit
however
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
citrus
the
flavor
combines
the
tartbitter
orange
peel
with
the
wheaty
malts
well
spice
on
this
is
lower
than
others
overall
a
good
refreshing
brew
from
clown
shoes
drinability
is
great
i
am
impressed
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
pleasant
wit
beer
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
in
quite
some
time
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grain
with
some
lemon
and
orange
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
i
get
wheat
yeast
and
oranges
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
pretty
good
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
1
finger
froathy
white
head
the
head
lasted
a
few
minutes
and
clung
a
bit
aroma
was
slightly
fruity
a
small
amount
of
bitter
orangey
smell
taste
had
a
small
amount
of
pepper
with
a
touch
of
cloves
but
was
predominantely
watered
down
orange
with
a
very
small
hint
of
grain
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
slightly
bitter
and
over
tingly
easy
to
drink
but
not
one
to
session
d
very
drinkable
very
summery
good
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
am
definitely
going
to
pick
up
again
and
again
great
package
even
better
product
like
i
said
before
my
new
summer
beer
thanks
gregg
for
the
opportunity
poured
the
color
of
orange
juice
with
a
quarter
inch
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
nose
was
lots
of
citrus
coriander
and
yeast
taste
follows
nose
but
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
in
consistency
with
a
pleasant
carbonation
level
a
very
nice
witbier
very
drinkable
and
the
bitterness
definitely
adds
some
interest
to
the
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
in
the
summer
will
certainly
purchase
it
again
the
taste
follows
the
nose
the
tangerine
and
orange
rind
flavors
are
very
pronounced
there
is
plenty
of
the
coriander
and
other
belgianesque
spices
such
as
star
anise
to
add
complexity
there
is
also
a
very
nice
summit
hops
that
are
a
touch
leafy
a
touch
citrus
and
overall
quite
mild
the
hop
orange
peel
spice
and
sweet
malt
complement
each
other
quite
nicely
the
beer
is
fairly
medium
bodied
which
adds
to
its
substance
this
is
a
beer
worth
seeking
out
the
abv
is
not
present
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
and
there
really
isnt
much
of
an
aftertaste
beyond
the
orange
and
coriander
lchaim
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
nice
aroma
of
cloves
and
orange
zest
taste
is
quite
good
starts
with
cloves
and
then
pushes
into
a
nice
orangy
spice
although
i
would
call
it
sweet
by
beer
standards
its
not
at
all
over
the
top
sweet
in
fact
the
orangeclove
flavor
goes
great
with
the
white
ale
style
it
doesnt
take
artificial
at
all
very
refreshing
and
my
favorite
so
far
from
this
brewery
i
thought
that
this
beer
was
very
interesting
this
style
for
me
has
been
ruled
by
the
matilda
by
goose
island
in
chicago
i
was
expecting
a
blue
moon
with
a
huge
slice
of
orange
or
a
delirium
tremens
with
a
slice
of
orange
lol
if
that
makes
sense
it
poured
the
expected
color
the
thing
i
most
noticed
is
that
it
really
differentiated
between
clementine
and
just
basic
orange
the
palate
was
like
a
combo
of
clementine
orange
peel
the
peel
big
time
and
clove
the
clove
like
hoegarden
it
didnt
have
the
mouthfeel
of
the
matilda
for
example
which
was
viscous
and
chewy
almost
i
gave
it
90
points
for
creativity
and
delicuousness
althought
after
a
bomber
im
all
set
fairly
thin
with
a
light
mouthfeel
for
the
style
highly
carbonated
really
good
version
of
the
style
smells
like
a
lemon
flavored
desert
taste
is
sweet
citrus
with
a
nice
little
bite
from
the
combo
of
sorachi
ace
and
ginger
very
well
done
the
best
things
about
this
beer
are
its
appearance
and
flavor
aroma
was
slight
and
body
was
perhaps
a
touch
thin
they
did
pretty
good
with
the
flavor
though
and
i
could
see
having
more
description
sounded
good
perhaps
the
soriachi
hops
made
it
not
work
for
me
was
an
ok
wit
hazy
winter
sun
yellow
with
moderate
white
head
smells
of
yeast
lemongrass
light
citrus
taste
is
good
a
bit
sharp
on
the
front
yeat
grass
lemon
in
the
middle
with
a
clean
finish
i
wanted
to
like
this
one
more
than
i
actually
did
but
it
is
overall
a
good
thirst
quenching
pour
unique
spiced
flavor
to
this
witbier
nice
change
of
pace
on
a
classic
o
a
bit
too
much
for
me
in
the
coriander
department
but
im
still
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
literally
the
start
of
it
all
this
really
was
a
pretty
unique
flavor
i
like
it
for
the
same
reason
that
i
like
allagash
the
flavors
are
well
integrated
and
the
feel
is
quite
nice
12oz
can
drank
this
with
jambalaya
in
charleston
greatly
refreshing
i
didnt
pick
up
on
the
ginger
much
pours
semihazy
light
yellow
a
little
lighter
than
other
wheats
no
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
citrus
and
some
malt
flavor
is
mild
grass
lemon
yes
lemongrass
and
wheat
low
alcohol
and
a
very
crisp
finish
make
this
a
great
brew
for
hot
summer
session
overall
a
really
good
idea
but
the
mixture
of
the
coriander
addition
and
the
belgian
yeast
overloads
the
taste
quite
a
bit
making
it
a
par
to
slightly
sub
par
wit
o
pretty
good
variant
on
a
classic
style
cheers
another
refreshing
beer
from
westbrook
pretty
standard
for
the
witbier
style
o
nice
different
take
on
the
old
belgian
wit
spicier
than
normal
plus
the
sorachi
hops
give
it
that
lemony
appeal
can
from
lazy
dog
in

head
pleasant
aroma

bit

funk
ginger

some
additional

good
amount

apples
light
bodied
with
medium

easy
drinking
wit
with
a
little
flare
not
bad
this
is
pretty
good
sessionable
i
dont
like
ginger
in
my
beer
so
this
isnt
something
i
would
drink
over
and
over
but
you
certainly
could
if
you
liked
it
o
i
could
probably
crush
a
whole
sixer
of
this
stuff
and
still
want
more
extremely
drinkable
and
very
flavorful
one
of
my
new
top
5
americanmade
witbiers
so
surprised
this
doesnt
have
a
higher
score
elements
of
a
classic
wit
with
extra
lemon
from
the
sorachi
i
couldnt
necessarily
discern
any
extra
spice
specifically
but
there
was
a
mildly
unpleasant
dryness
at
the
finish
not
bad
overall
but
not
one
i
would
revisit
a
fluffy
feel
on
the
tongue
starts
it
off
exceptionally
smooth
before
some
crispness
comes
in
biting
a
bit
it
moves
from
semidry
to
semisweet
with
the
herb
translating
to
the
mouthfeel
o
the
beer
has
a
good
unique
taste
to
me
but
i
dont
like
the
hefeweizenstyle
taste
of
honey
baked
ham
beer
is
true
to
style
but
not
my
favorite
style
interesting
take
though
oan
average
tasting
wit
nothing
offputting
overall
an
interesting
wit
i
like
the
thai
spices
overall
a
perfectly
competent
witbier
it
does
take
on
a
bit
more
bitter
orange
than
i
usually
like
still
its
quite
drinkable
worth
a
try
love
love
this
beer
when
you
need
to
beat
that
sc
heat
tastes
like
a
regular
belgian
maybe
a
little
interesting
hop
coming
through
but
nothing
to
out
of
the
ordinary
overall
if
i
had
access
to
this
beer
in
my
area
this
would
probably
be
an
occasional
repurchase
particularly
in
the
summer
to
me
this
beer
is
what
blue
moon
tries
to
be
a
flavorful
light
casual
drinking
experience
o
refreshing
summer
quaffer
this
beer
is
tasty
but
very
muted
good
for
drinking
at
a
barbecue
at
an
easy
5
o
im
not
a
fan
of
ginger
but
westbrook
executed
this
very
well
this
is
what
they
intended
and
they
pulled
it
off
its
just
a
question
of
whether
you
like
ginger
and
lemongrass
in
your
witbiers
pours
a
deeply
pastel
yellow
with
a
softness
to
a
slight
hint
of
orange
hue
milky
hazy
and
a
scant
head
of
white
foam
visually
very
appealing
even
thought
the
head
does
fall
off
fast
and
leaves
only
a
think
ring
nose
is
lemony
with
a
touch
of
ginger
for
a
back
note
it
has
a
cracker
like
malt
scent
on
the
nose
tall
wheat
with
a
perfume
that
is
a
touch
sweet
a
bit
of
spice
form
the
sorachi
ace
hops
but
not
too
much
pervading
sweetness
the
taste
is
a
creamy
and
soft
malt
on
a
delicate
hop
body
the
ginger
is
very
understated
but
it
lends
a
bit
of
lightness
to
the
drink
rather
than
heat
or
spiciness
lemongrass
uplifts
the
nose
and
this
one
is
delicate
and
yet
has
a
fullness
on
the
palate
that
is
all
about
flavor
and
not
heaviness
the
wheat
is
naturally
sweet
crisp
dry
but
also
soft
yielding
has
a
nice
juicy
middle
without
any
real
tartness
and
a
delicate
blending
of
the
hops
and
the
what
malt
finish
it
not
dry
but
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
this
was
alright
witbiers
arent
my
favorite
style
but
like
most
westbrook
beers
it
was
executed
well
the
taste
is
very
good
with
tons
of
malt
in
the
initial
taste
and
gentle
creaminess
from
the
yeast
which
also
adds
a
light
fruit
element
with
nice
toasted
flavor
coming
through
and
gentle
tangy
wheat
quality
throughout
with
mellow
spice
overall
i
enjoyed
this
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
and
pretty
yeasty
with
very
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
that
would
pair
very
well
with
all
sorts
of
foods
asian
food
as
well
as
backyard
grill
if
you
see
it
get
it
it
pours
a
golden
hue
similar
to
what
one
would
have
seen
from
angkor
wats
spires
rising
from
the
green
jungle
the
smell
of
lemongrass
scented
stirfries
is
followed
candied
ginger
desserts
the
piercing
spice
of
the
bitter
hops
refreshes
the
palate
in
fact
this
beer
nearly
nails
all
the
peripherals
of
witbier
but
there
is
no
sweetness
in
flavor
the
spiciness
of
the
ginger
is
refreshing
but
onedimensional
it
would
be
the
perfect
compliment
to
anything
spicy
but
the
taste
alone
is
nothing
lustrous
on
its
own
pours
a
cloudymilky
gold
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
ginger
hint
of
citrus
hint
of
hop
and
slight
yeast
fits
the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
slight
ginger
hint
of
coriander
yeast
slight
citrus
and
a
hint
of
hop
overall
the
ginger
isnt
too
strong
and
the
appearance
aroma
and
body
are
good
very
light
hazy
color
poured
in
a
glass
mouthfeel
is
like
a
typical
pale
aleipa
at
first
sip
you
get
a
very
crisp
refreshing
hop
flavor
with
minimal
bitterness
a
little
citrusy
with
a
perfect
blend
of
spices
very
good
and
would
buy
again
in
a
heartbeat
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
for
my
husband
since
hes
a
huge
witbeir
person
after
his
first
sip
his
comment
was
damn
this
is
good
and
id
have
to
agree
i
like
witbeirs
but
the
white
thai
actually
reminded
me
a
bit
of
a
hefeweisen
too
its
very
smooth
and
lightly
floral
and
sweet
i
see
this
as
being
one
of
my
go
to
beers
to
drink
at
my
neighborhood
pool
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
great
it
doesnt
quite
deliver
on
the
spices
it
boasts
of
on
its
packaging
but
its
appearance
in
the
glass
and
feel
on
the
palate
are
both
top
notch
i
wouldnt
pass
this
up
if
it
were
offered
to
me
with
some
szechuan
noodles
but
i
doubt
id
seek
it
out
again
otherwise
i
would
have
liked
to
see
more
sorachi
ace
hops
in
this
i
mean
i
know
its
not
a
hop
forward
style
or
anything
but
they
are
so
unique
and
would
have
complimented
the
flavors
here
really
nicely
but
instead
they
are
extremely
muted
just
subtle
lemon
in
the
finish
that
might
just
as
possibly
come
from
the
lemongrass
fun
beer
though
frothy
and
well
carbonated
and
lower
in
alcohol
a
nice
interesting
summer
session
i
appreciate
the
subtle
use
of
ginger
usually
in
beer
its
just
way
too
much
almost
hot
defeating
the
purpose
to
some
extent
here
its
just
a
little
twist
that
marries
well
with
the
wheat
malt
while
the
meadowy
sort
of
grassy
tones
make
it
a
nice
spring
seasonal
more
sorachi
ace
character
would
make
this
one
of
a
kind
but
i
still
appreciate
this
unique
take
on
a
wit
westbrook
has
done
a
great
job
of
tweaking
classic
styles
to
make
entirely
new
beer
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
that
o
a
nice
take
on
a
witbier
very
sessionable
pour
is
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
tight
white
head
and
decent
lacing
nose
is
a
fair
bit
of
lemon
light
yeast
note
and
a
hint
of
pepper
some
grassy
herbal
hops
in
back
taste
has
more
spice
to
it
lemony
up
front
with
a
hint
of
banana
stronger
pepper
spice
comes
in
behind
flavors
thin
out
a
little
bit
through
the
finish
grassy
hop
a
bit
herbal
strong
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
overall
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
id
love
to
taste
those
other
flavors
advertised
as
that
would
take
this
beer
from
ordinary
to
really
great
if
i
wanted
a
beer
to
drink
all
night
this
would
easily
be
it
lots
of
complexity
but
still
easydrinking
and
perfect
at
only
5
abv
o
a
unique
and
interesting
beer
but
a
little
too
much
clove
and
banana
presence
for
me
i
agree
with
others
that
the
lemon
and
ginger
notes
could
be
stronger
and
would
enhance
the
beer
even
more
still
a
pretty
good
beer
o
unique
beer
very
drinkable
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
well
balanced
beer
the
flavors
play
off
each
other
nicely
between
the
spice
and
citrus
notes
i
was
able
to
have
both
this
and
one
claw
from
westbrook
and
have
been
really
impressed
hoping
to
have
gose
at
some
point
soon
white
thai
is
my
first
offering
from
this
south
carolina
brewery
and
although
far
from
their
highest
rated
beer
was
still
an
immensely
positive
first
impression
westbrook
brewing
have
gotten
a
lot
of
high
praise
and
its
easy
to
see
why
they
clearly
know
what
theyre
doing
and
seem
to
do
it
very
well
next
time
ill
be
buying
every
beer
of
theirs
i
see
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
its
refreshing
and
a
bit
of
a
twist
on
the
wit
style
the
only
problem
is
that
the
thai
elements
need
to
be
amped
up
while
it
sounds
delicious
to
have
lemongrass
in
a
wit
youre
left
wanting
after
a
taste
everythings
just
a
bit
too
muted
the
beer
isnt
terrible
just
too
bland
soft
and
boring
amp
up
the
thai
elements
and
add
some
crispness
and
it
could
be
stellar
canned
101413
hazy
golden
almost
yellow
pour
with
a
quite
nice
head
and
long
lasting
lacing
slight
nose
of
belgian
yeast
with
lemon
and
banana
notes
over
a
spicy
character
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
slick
mouthfeel
and
normal
carbonation
a
quite
interesting
but
not
overbearing
taste
of
ginger
and
lemon
as
it
warms
the
lemon
flavor
takes
on
more
of
a
zest
quality
crisp
finish
with
a
nice
tart
and
bitter
kick
poured
into
sam
adams
glass
one
finger
head
developed
with
mild
lacing
and
retention
was
white
in
color
appearance
was
a
very
hazy
lemon
orange
color
aroma
was
of
citrus
and
some
allspice
with
some
hop
and
yeast
notes
tasted
of
spice
and
citrus
with
some
grass
notes
aftertaste
was
a
bit
bitter
with
a
medium
almost
a
syrup
texture
mouth
feel
o
i
would
definitely
call
this
a
saison
instead
of
a
witbier
and
an
enjoyable
one
i
like
the
spicy
ginger
bite
against
the
sorachi
ace
hops
complements
well
good
citrusy
character
too
body
is
a
bit
heavy
for
style
but
works
if
you
think
saison
glad
to
try
this
one
o
interesting
flavor
the
ginger
is
only
in
a
hint
of
spice
the
lemon
most
overpowers
with
a
hint
of
bitter
bright
hops
on
the
back
worth
a
try
but
i
would
like
to
see
this
with
thai
basil
this
is
pretty
decent
for
the
style
but
nothin
outstanding
hmmm
this
ones
not
bad
it
just
very
enigmatic
i
think
the
problem
is
that
its
a
little
too
dry
and
spiced
without
anything
there
to
balance
it
the
lemon
notes
are
present
but
dont
provoke
much
tartness
or
sweetness
and
so
the
beer
suffers
as
a
result
because
the
yeast
and
the
ginger
sure
as
hell
provide
some
dryness
and
spice
okay
but
not
something
id
reach
for
regularly
o
a
decent
wit
with
a
definite
twist
the
ginger
certainly
keeps
the
traditional
citrus
notes
toned
down
while
stubbornly
giving
way
to
the
lemon
notes
from
both
the
hops
and
lemongrass
probably
one
of
the
more
unique
wits
ive
had
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
just
different
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
in
a
can
i
really
like
this
westbrook
offering
great
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
o
a
great
but
odd
wheat
beer
extremely
drinkable
i
love
the
strange
flavors
from
the
gingerlemongrass
flavor
is
also
tea
like
with
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
earthy
hop
bitterness
is
light
again
more
of
a
pale
ale
impression
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
slightly
bitter
good
flavor
and
session
potential
would
like
to
try
this
fresh
on
tap
in
sc
to
compare
someday
very
dark
for
a
witbier
nose
seems
almost
like
clay
flavor
is
quite
muddled
not
the
light
and
airy
or
bright
character
that
witbiers
typically
come
off
as
this
is
definitely
much
more
earthy
much
more
feel
is
smooth
easy
to
drink
but
not
precisely
a
witbier
by
old
world
standards
still
though
this
style
comes
off
as
a
disaster
from
so
many
other
breweries
a
well
made
attempt
i
could
be
convinced
to
try
this
again
o
very
impressed
this
competes
favorably
against
the
nice
750ml
wheat
beers
on
the
market
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
if
you
like
your
wheat
beers
fruitforward
not
too
spicy
and
silky
smooth
i
highly
recommend
you
check
this
out
poured
a
golden
body
with
good
carbonation
and
head
on
top
of
an
interesting
aroma
as
the
typical
citriclemonzest
and
spice
one
associates
with
a
wit
are
replaced
with
ginger
and
i
guess
thai
light
easy
to
drink
like
most
wits
ive
had
but
a
little
spicier
and
bitter
so
to
say
and
has
a
crisp
backbite
enjoyable
and
an
interesting
take
and
while
not
my
favorite
i
think
its
a
good
beer
o
looking
for
something
to
switch
up
the
summer
rotation
this
is
it
m
medium
bodied
o
overall
a
very
interesting
and
nice
witbier
no
pepper
which
is
a
big
plus
to
me
and
a
lot
of
fruit
and
citrus
worth
checking
out
would
definitely
pick
it
up
sometime
odd
beer
pretty
good
beer
strange
but
hey
i
admire
the
effort
behind
it
the
spirit
of
experimentation
very
refreshing
and
pleasant
if
you
pair
that
with
very
spicy
foods
you
will
be
in
heaven
nice
pour
out
of
a
can
into
my
bhb
tulip
glass
white
head
nice
and
cloudy
yellow
hazy
just
like
a
wit
should
be
smell
is
of
spices
clove
banana
everything
i
want
in
this
style
is
in
the
nose
hopefully
it
translates
to
the
taste
dont
really
get
the
promised
asian
spices
and
flavors
but
damn
a
very
drinkable
hefe
style
beer
really
wanted
to
get
the
promised
ginger
which
hurts
the
rating
only
because
i
dont
get
it
though
i
love
the
beer
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
the
text
on
the
can
sold
me
into
giving
it
a
shot
well
still
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
grows
on
you
solidly
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
in
the
yard
and
it
is
definitly
a
twist
on
the
style
and
can
see
this
as
a
summer
staple
in
many
a
wit
lovers
fridge
othis
beer
would
go
great
with
some
spicy
indian
food
or
out
on
the
beach
ill
definitely
be
picking
it
up
again
it
is
a
very
unique
style
overall
decent
wit
i
dont
love
the
style
but
its
drinkable
not
sure
id
drink
more
than
a
taster
though
the
beer
is
hazy
and
pale
yellow
with
a
soapy
white
head
the
aroma
brings
earthy
hops
floral
notes
lemongrass
some
nice
citrus
and
pepper
in
the
flavor
coriander
and
orange
zest
really
drinkable
complex
and
intriguing
but
also
something
you
could
gulp
straight
from
the
can
on
a
spring
day
very
nice
this
beer
does
exactly
what
its
meant
to
do
quench
your
thirst
and
keeps
you
wanting
another
sip
pairs
very
well
with
food
and
great
for
sunny
days
by
the
pool
o
a
nice
refreshing
wit
that
satisfies
the
palate
the
salty
tobacco
profile
is
a
winner
for
me
this
is
something
i
would
drink
all
summer
long
o
i
found
this
beer
to
be
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
refreshing
i
thought
the
southeast
asian
influence
of
the
lemongrass
and
ginger
was
really
nice
o
subtle
interesting
twist
on
wit
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
does
have
that
asian
influence
a
really
good
drinker
it
has
such
delicate
qualities
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
because
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
the
tasteparticularly
the
lemongrasswas
very
unique
for
the
style
o
nice
but
not
superb
the
ginger
is
subtle
but
nice
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
witbiers
are
certainly
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoy
this
brew
id
drink
again
but
i
doubt
its
something
id
go
to
often
certainly
not
going
to
replace
westbrook
ipa
as
a
standard
in
my
fridge
my
first
time
trying
this
beer
and
im
a
huge
fan
it
goes
over
and
above
the
run
of
the
mill
witbier
and
adds
depth
of
flavor
aroma
and
a
great
feel
cant
wait
to
crack
one
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
had
a
can
while
staying
in
charleston
holy
cow
so
delicious
on
phone
so
ill
keep
it
simple
smoothest
most
balanced
witbier
ive
ever
had
lost
points
for
lacking
spicyness
they
advertised
at
5
abv
i
could
see
myself
drinking
plenty
of
these
not
a
ton
of
thai
flavor
but
enough
to
make
things
interesting
and
a
solid
wit
base
besides
nice
had
to
have
a
canned
beer
for
a
friends
boat
and
discovered
this
at
frugal
mcdougals
in
ft
mill
sc
excellent
discovery
i
recently
took
a
cooler
of
it
to
a
bbq
festival
in
charlotte
nc
and
it
was
a
big
hit
im
going
to
charleston
in
early
dec
2012
and
have
wife
approval
for
a
stop
at
the
brewery
served
this
witbier
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
a
pint
glass
this
witbier
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
produced
a
small
white
head
poor
retention
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
wheat
spicy
herbs
and
citric
lemon
light
in
body
a
foundation
of
malted
wheat
banana
lemongrass
spicy
ginger
and
coriander
there
was
an
evident
tea
like
quality
as
well
this
was
an
interesting
take
on
a
witbier
outside
of
the
box
ingredients
used
made
for
an
interesting
session
beer
nothing
exceptional
here
but
defiantly
worth
a
try
o
another
tasty
beer
from
westbrook
i
like
their
twist
on
the
traditional
witbier
style
i
think
the
ginger
adds
a
great
deal
to
the
aroma
and
a
nice
little
bite
to
the
taste
a
very
drinkable
beer
dont
sleep
on
westbrook
they
dont
make
bad
beers
o
refreshing
and
good
for
style
as
it
turns
out
i
have
a
tulip
glass
from
belgian
independence
day
21
july
2012
which
i
got
at
the
celebration
at
the
bronx
ale
house
hooray
i
used
the
inverted
crack
glug
and
ended
up
with
over
two
fingers
of
dense
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
color
was
a
very
cloudy
lemonyellow
and
it
looked
like
a
glassful
of
lemon
meringue
pie
nose
was
zesty
with
the
lemongrass
and
the
ginger
seemingly
fighting
for
supremacy
mouthfeel
was
soft
like
it
was
caressing
my
tongue
and
the
melding
of
the
flavors
was
beautiful
lemon
definitely
but
as
to
what
type
of
candy
they
were
alluding
to
i
do
not
know
lots
of
nice
ginger
spiciness
also
and
i
was
beginning
to
mull
over
which
dishes
i
would
order
at
a
byob
with
a
sixer
of
this
in
tow
finish
was
very
dry
and
very
refreshing
this
is
just
what
the
canquest
tm
ordered
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
brew
with
a
great
finish
and
awesome
flavor
combinations
semi
complex
with
a
good
bit
of
things
happening
in
here
a
huge
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
a
great
package
including
this
one
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
wheat
spice
taste
is
lemons
wheat
a
touch
of
ginger
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
unique
and
pretty
good
beer
o
not
really
my
favorite
but
not
offensive
i
cant
really
find
anything
wrong
with
it
just
didnt
do
anything
to
excite
me
that
said
i
have
a
few
more
in
the
fridge
so
if
a
second
impression
changes
my
mind
i
will
update
the
review
this
would
do
very
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
the
holy
city
of
charleston
m
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
somewhat
higher
carbonation
that
i
would
like
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
witbier
its
original
and
refreshing
id
love
to
pair
this
with
thai
food
its
also
a
perfect
summer
porchdrinking
candidate
im
impressed
with
westbrook
after
having
their
two
yearround
beers
and
i
wish
i
could
try
their
more
limited
offerings
o
really
suited
for
summer
not
a
full
bodied
beer
by
any
stretch
but
enjoyable
perhaps
not
for
the
wit
purist
but
enjoyable
and
and
fun
to
try
overall
tastes
like
a
witbier
cut
with
herbal
tea
so
a
wit
thats
off
the
beaten
path
cost
10
99
for
a
six
pack
of
12
oz
cans
i
am
not
a
wit
fan
but
still
enjoyed
this
one
immensely
great
aromas
of
bannana
and
lemon
taste
is
yeasty
and
wheat
the
lemony
spicy
taste
really
works
sorachi
hops
was
genius
above
average
mouthfeel
lacey
excellent
drinkability
lovely
summer
beer
palate
is
interesting
quite
tangy
and
lemony
full
bodied
and
semisweet
lemongrass
comes
through
more
on
the
palate
and
pairs
well
with
the
more
subtle
presence
of
ginger
the
spices
are
thankfully
not
overdone
taking
a
backseat
to
the
grainy
wheat
backbone
and
floral
yeast
character
pretty
unique
stuff
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
looking
around
for
a
summer
beer
with
a
difference
look
no
further
than
this
gem
even
if
you
arent
a
big
fan
of
wits
o
one
of
the
best
wits
ive
ever
had
only
real
fault
is
i
wish
the
head
had
stayed
around
longer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
very
refreshing
beer
that
seems
to
stay
very
consistent
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
last
for
a
little
but
slowly
faded
i
cant
see
through
my
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
spicy
lemongrass
orange
and
a
hint
of
hops
it
tastes
awesome
it
says
it
is
brewed
with
sorachi
ace
hops
which
come
through
just
enough
to
give
it
a
nice
spice
bitterness
and
it
has
some
ginger
too
it
is
still
very
much
a
wheat
beer
but
with
these
other
flavors
it
pulls
in
some
flavors
similar
to
a
belgian
style
tripel
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
lighter
bodied
nice
carbonation
a
bit
thin
a
bit
watery
but
drinks
easy
i
imagine
much
more
suited
for
warmer
weather
i
think
the
best
way
to
sum
it
up
is
that
this
has
much
less
of
the
characteristics
i
normall
dislike
about
a
witbier
this
beer
was
really
surprising
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
the
style
but
the
bigger
citrus
notes
really
added
something
to
this
one
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wits
but
this
is
pretty
tasty
and
refreshing
a
nice
little
beer
that
id
love
to
come
back
to
when
im
in
sc
again
over
the
summer
overall
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
ever
had
absolutely
great
beer
with
such
well
measured
spice
flavor
and
a
nice
crisp
finish
altogether
fantastic
very
well
done
and
cheers
to
everyone
at
westbrook
brewing
company
this
is
a
really
cool
beer
i
think
it
has
somewhat
of
a
nonthreatening
massmarket
potential
even
among
non
craft
beer
drinkers
but
at
the
same
time
i
think
people
who
enjoy
and
appreciate
fullflavored
beer
will
enjoy
and
appreciate
this
beer
for
what
it
is
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
charleston
evening
a
very
nice
tasty
refreshing
spin
on
the
tradition
witbier
this
is
one
of
westbrooks
yearround
offerings
and
it
has
turned
into
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
extremely
drinkable
at
5
and
is
a
beer
that
i
never
get
tired
of
i
cannot
wait
for
this
to
be
canned
so
i
can
always
have
a
supply
in
the
beer
fridge
took
a
growler
home
from
the
brewery
cracked
it
when
it
was
a
week
old
good
head
retention
with
an
average
golden
hue
aroma
is
nothing
to
speak
of
very
little
spiciness
to
it
getting
a
bit
of
wit
type
yeast
aroma
but
very
low
on
the
lemony
or
ginger
notes
aroma
is
best
described
as
flat
the
beer
is
clean
actually
a
bit
too
clean
with
an
unbalanced
bitterness
that
just
doesnt
fit
with
a
refreshing
wit
type
brew
swampy
finish
with
a
bit
of
muddled
earthy
ginger
flavor
overall
not
a
favorite
if
youre
looking
for
a
refreshing
wit
in
charleston
mothership
from
new
belgium
and
allagash
white
are
readiy
available
and
preferable
had
this
one
with
my
dinner
during
my
birthday
dinner
with
a
few
friends
served
from
tap
into
a
nonic
poured
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
fruit
floral
notes
and
spices
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
bread
floral
notes
and
subtle
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
brew
i
had
heard
lots
of
people
in
the
area
talking
badly
about
this
beer
so
i
jumped
at
the
chance
to
try
it
for
myself
i
found
it
quite
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
it
was
pretty
much
spot
on
for
what
you
would
expect
for
the
style
with
the
addition
of
a
few
subtle
spices
to
give
it
a
little
kick
and
stand
out
from
the
rest
a
definite
must
try
if
you
get
the
chance
really
enjoyed
this
beer
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
a
perfect
match
for
food
seek
this
beer
out
when
visiting
charleston
in
the
summer
had
this
at
the
brewery
not
up
to
all
the
hype
that
is
around
chas
average
wit
cant
really
taste
the
ginger
or
lemongrass
try
their
ipa
its
the
best
one
they
have
very
thin
beer
seems
to
be
common
with
their
beers
color
was
on
par
with
a
wit
smell
was
also
very
weak
overall
this
was
solid
not
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
but
i
was
really
not
complaining
after
i
drank
it
would
not
mind
trying
again
d
extremely
drinkable
smooth
refreshing
d
a
good
take
on
the
witbier
drinkable
d
really
good
drinkability
the
girlfriend
and
i
had
no
problem
killing
the
growler
i
think
with
a
couple
of
tweaks
this
could
be
a
new
favorite
id
love
to
see
the
ginger
and
lemongrass
ramped
up
to
play
a
more
prominent
role
like
the
basil
in
the
bruerys
trade
winds
tripel
still
very
nice
first
offering
i
really
thought
it
was
a
cross
between
a
hefe
and
a
witbier
i
look
forward
to
trying
his
other
beers
as
ive
tasted
many
of
his
homebrews
and
know
how
good
of
a
brewer
he
is
the
real
bottom
line
is
white
thai
is
a
better
witbier
than
some
of
the
big
dogs
avery
ommegang
and
is
brewed
in
my
home
state
i
look
forward
to
putting
back
a
few
dozen
more
of
these
and
seeing
how
it
evolves
nice
work
westbrook
tastes
fairly
bland
citrus
is
absent
in
the
taste
as
well
astringent
and
thin
bodied
supple
at
the
end
wheaty
simple
sort
of
quenching
but
not
very
exciting
with
a
name
like
citrus
avenue
its
a
crime
to
have
this
little
citrus
flavor
good
beer
that
has
a
nice
orange
hint
to
it
its
subtle
poured
from
the
bottle
and
loved
this
beer
as
a
witbier
style
it
was
well
executed
with
a
fair
amount
of
alcohol
somewhat
creamy
notes
of
coriander
and
spice
are
tasted
but
most
prevalent
was
the
orange
flavor
when
drinking
this
beer
with
a
friend
we
joked
of
it
tasting
like
orange
juice
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
in
my
opinion
i
dont
recall
the
age
of
the
beer
but
it
was
certainly
delicious
bold
flavor
paired
with
an
excellent
execution
makes
a
very
good
beer
highly
recommended
i
think
this
is
probably
one
of
the
very
best
wits
ive
had
and
ive
had
a
lot
of
them
this
is
a
textbook
perfect
example
of
the
style
and
i
would
be
proud
if
i
were
to
have
brewed
this
a
delicious
beer
highly
highly
recommended
exceptional
did
not
like
this
one
at
all
required
outlier
review
easy
to
drink
but
needs
more
orange
tastes
just
like
it
sounds
orange
wheat
for
a
local
san
diego
brew
you
cant
go
wrong
its
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
definite
orange
flavour
worth
a
try
beginner
beer
enthusiast
me
favorite
anything
coronado
is
great
thats
all
that
needs
to
be
said
here
bought
a
six
pack
that
was
on
sale
and
was
glad
i
did
poured
from
a
bottle
this
beer
was
light
in
color
but
quite
cloudy
small
head
which
diminished
almost
immediately
on
the
first
sip
the
spicy
citrusy
flavors
come
thru
in
a
mild
way
the
finish
has
a
strong
lime
taste
that
is
clean
and
refreshing
a
easy
drinking
beer
with
some
complexity
serving
type
bottle
coriander
spice
dominates
taste
not
my
favorite
spice
wit
fans
wont
like
this
one
i
hate
wits
more
like
a
light
hef
with
some
mild
citrus
notes
this
is
a
spring
or
summer
by
the
pool
beer
softer
than
an
ipa
but
brighter
than
a
hef
very
enjoyable
but
not
strong
example
of
the
style
a
great
alternative
to
an
ipa
or
cerveca
after
surfing
oa
nice
wit
very
well
balanced
i
can
see
having
a
few
on
a
warm
summer
night
overall
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
that
are
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
does
that
and
also
has
some
complexity
in
the
taste
o
this
is
just
begging
to
be
a
great
wit
perhaps
it
needs
some
lemon
still
a
pleasant
brew
cheers
i
was
anxious
to
try
this
as
a
fan
of
the
style
and
a
recent
resident
of
san
diego
county
it
pours
a
nice
orange
but
the
head
is
not
impressive
and
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
a
bit
weak
with
mostly
honey
and
faint
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
follows
the
aroma
but
i
think
the
honey
sweetness
is
a
bit
overpowering
overall
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
great
however
i
would
drink
it
again
despite
an
underwhelming
taste
it
was
quite
refreshing
oi
like
that
brewers
are
experimenting
with
styles
and
i
like
trying
those
experiments
but
the
honey
really
doesnt
work
for
me
as
an
wit
i
was
expect
a
light
color
and
a
citrus
crispness
what
i
got
was
a
hoppy
amber
beer
the
hop
feel
sat
on
my
tongue
like
an
ipa
there
was
zero
citrus
crispness
as
such
it
was
not
to
style
in
the
least
bit
instead
i
would
judge
this
beer
as
an
amber
ale
in
which
case
i
would
rate
it
slightly
higher
but
it
would
still
be
unremarkable
a
let
down
the
description
sounded
great
but
the
beer
just
wasnt
that
great

this
another

lightly
flavored
i
note
some
wheat
and
hop
in
the
swallow
very
short
aftertaste
easy
to
drink
but
void
of
any
interest
d
i
am
a
coronado
fan
as
most
of
the
offerings
that
they
put
out
are
solid
but
this
one
is
a
big
miss
for
me
i
can
appreciate
the
need
for
a
nice
refreshing
light
belgian
wit
in
your
lineup
but
at
least
make
it
something
special
this
is
just
plain
drab
shock
top
says
hello
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
its
very
similar
to
blue
moon
but
done
way
better
overall
a
good
witbier
it
is
good
to
see
these
newbies
here
in
boston
as
i
look
forward
to
trying
out
more
of
their
styles
of
beers
good
stiff
so
far
overall
a
fairly
solid
and
pleasant
witbier
fizzy
quickly
dissipating
cap
very
hazy
amberorange
color
aromas
of
wheat
grain
and
earthy
citrus
rind
oranges
a
bit
spicy
medium
bodied
with
lowish
carbonation
felt
a
little
dull
low
bitterness
with
more
wheat
orange
and
spicy
character
decent
overall
i
liked
the
orange
aroma
but
it
didnt
carry
through
as
well
into
the
flavour
something
about
the
whole
experience
feels
thin
to
me
the
flavor
doesnt
round
it
to
be
all
that
satisfying
to
me
and
is
a
bit
underwhelming
the
added
spices
also
throw
the
balance
a
little
too
far
in
that
direction
has
that
flavored
soda
feel
for
some
reason
on
the
positive
side
it
brought
a
different
blend
of
flavors
though
something
was
missing
probably
this
would
have
worked
better
on
a
hoppier
wheat
beer
this
beer
is
unusually
thick
its
medium
body
quite
big
for
a
wit
it
still
has
a
certain
softness
though
its
brightly
crisp
all
the
way
through
i
want
to
score
it
higher
but
for
slightly
too
much
of
a
syrupysticky
thing
going
on
and
only
a
moderate
smoothness
overall
easy
session
beer
for
summerfall
good
one
for
the
crossover
crowd
as
well
o
i
like
all
of
the
aspects
of
this
beer
with
the
exception
of
the
herbal
hopmedicinal
flavor
that
lingers
a
bit
in
the
finish
otherwise
a
middle
of
the
road
witbier
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
well
hidden
alcohol
but
not
really
interesting
enough
for
me
to
get
again
overall
a
tasty
wit
o
just
a
solid
wheat
beer
with
some
strong
citrus
notes
better
to
have
orange
in
your
beer
this
way
than
what
blue
moon
does
a
good
witbier
a
bit
pronounced
on
the
orange
note
but
very
good
a
sort
of
middlerange
witbier
one
tempered
by
a
straightup
citrus
fruit
and
sweetness
but
lacking
the
edgy
yeast
and
grain
characters
necessary
to
provide
the
expected
balance
of
course
this
offering
somehow
finds
its
way
around
that
particular
dichotomy
one
which
im
still
trying
to
figure
out
so
if
you
take
one
thing
from
all
of
this
it
should
be
orange
and
all
the
things
that
rhyme
with
it
man
i
just
cant
get
away
from
the
90s
altrock
references
tonight
oh
well
overall
good
wheat
beer
not
much
orange
taste
o
id
like
to
say
i
enjoyed
it
more
but
it
was
just
alright
for
me
i
wouldnt
like
to
have
it
very
often
but
if
it
was
paired
up
with
dinner
at
someones
house
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
just
ok
overall
nothing
special
here
very
bland
and
forgetable
lacks
flavor
balance
and
overal
fruity
flavors
that
most
of
this
wits
have
nothing
worth
drinking
again
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
witbier
the
addition
of
the
orange
doesnt
detract
from
the
wheat
as
the
wheat
seems
to
have
been
turned
up
to
compensate
also
the
nonartificial
nature
of
the
orange
really
impresses
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
some
citruslike
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
all
that
exciting
add
some
complexity
particularly
in
the
aftertaste
and
this
could
be
special
o
a
very
disappointing
effort
for
a
wheat
beer
and
pretty
much
tasteless
never
again
o
an
average
brew
i
like
beers
with
more
flavor
however
i
could
see
this
being
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
on
the
beach
however
doesnt
exactly
hit
the
mark
for
a
witbier
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
wit
and
could
definitely
be
improved
on
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
oranges
some
wheat
taste
is
orange
peel
wheat
a
bit
on
the
tart
side
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
overall
i
felt
this
beer
was
somewhat
over
carbonated
but
it
was
refreshing
for
a
nice
summers
day
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
head
and
no
lace
its
aroma
is
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
mild
citrus
the
flavor
leads
with
bread
with
honey
and
mild
malt
sweetness
with
very
faint
orange
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
coronado
orange
wit
is
a
refreshing
decent
beer
recommended
o
i
was
not
expecting
a
beer
this
bad
this
is
unfortunate
o
interesting
how
they
got
it
to
taste
so
fruity
but
it
misses
the
mark
ends
up
tasting
similar
to
leinies
sunset
wheat
cheers
being
a
light
wit
this
would
be
suitable
for
a
nice
summery
day
since
it
is
snowing
outside
its
pretty
wrong
for
today
the
orange
taste
is
buried
based
on
this
beer
i
will
avoid
this
brewery
the
beer
poured
out
as
a
lightly
hazed
yellowish
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
that
didnt
do
too
much
besides
disappear
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
sweet
with
orange
aromas
sadly
the
orange
aromas
are
more
like
orange
soda
its
a
little
too
sweet
i
think
on
the
nose
the
taste
kind
of
jumps
in
the
same
direction
which
hinders
my
thoughts
i
felt
that
the
mouthfeel
was
also
a
little
too
thin
as
well
it
seemed
flat
to
me
very
little
if
any
carbonation
here
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
too
much
and
i
probably
wouldnt
have
this
one
again
pours
like
a
standard
wit
yellow
and
hazy
aroma
is
full
of
orange
citrus
and
wheat
malt
in
the
taste
semi
sweet
wheat
and
orange
flavors
playing
off
each
other
and
a
restrained
hoppy
bitterness
with
dry
orange
peel
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
wheat
orange
and
finishes
mildly
bitter
medium
bodied
and
crisp
overall
a
pretty
decent
wit
went
well
with
curry
overall
for
what
it
is
it
is
very
good
the
orange
is
subtle
but
present
enough
to
have
a
nice
sweet
finish
which
makes
this
one
of
the
better
tasting
wits
i
have
had
pours
a
pale
filtered
wheat
bright
fluffy
white
head
aroma
has
orange
peel
hints
of
honey
and
spices
with
coriander
and
chammomile
flavor
semi
sweet
spicy
flavor
with
honey
and
orange
peel
in
the
background
of
this
witbier
mouthfeel
is
dry
semi
sweet
with
a
light
to
medium
bodied
spices
really
coat
the
palate
drinkable
for
sure
especially
in
warmer
weather
d
a
very
nice
wit
it
is
a
little
strong
on
the
citrus
side
with
less
spice
and
pepper
than
im
used
to
having
but
with
a
great
abv
like
this
you
can
have
a
few
great
on
a
hot
day
my
glass
of
this
beer
disappears
really
fast
but
it
really
wasnt
all
that
memorable
this
is
not
the
most
complex
wit
but
it
is
easy
overall
nice
summer
ale
that
will
satisfy
any
craft
beer
drinker
pours
a
cloudy
amber
orange
color
served
with
orange
slice
that
is
not
needed
tastes
like
wheat
yeast
and
some
fruit
flavors
mostly
orange
and
spice
but
also
some
hop
presence
aftertaste
is
a
tangy
hoppy
flavor
almost
bitter
its
definitely
drinkable
and
tastes
pretty
good
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
poured
out
of
a
tap
into
a
pint
glass
color
was
golden
orange
and
there
was
just
a
light
film
of
head
smelled
a
hint
of
orange
and
sweet
but
not
that
much
after
i
actually
sucked
some
of
the
beer
into
my
nostils
looking
for
a
smell
tasted
like
oranges
specifically
orange
peels
mild
carbonation
good
after
taste
though
great
for
a
summer
beer
mediumbodied
with
a
tart
effervescence
up
front
aftertaste
has
a
bit
more
malt
presence
with
a
faint
warming
on
the
palate
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
an
interesting
wit
orange
is
in
the
nose
but
there
is
also
a
strange
baby
aspiring
smell
as
well
the
appearance
was
a
touch
dark
for
a
wit
more
like
a
heffe
the
taste
is
very
good
though
mouthfeel
is
very
lively
overall
i
like
it
more
than
most
wits
the
orange
notes
sweeten
the
taste
a
little
and
give
it
a
tiny
bit
of
fruityiness
that
makes
the
beer
distinctive
d
not
bad
it
is
well
balanced
and
moderately
flavorful
which
puts
it
firmly
in
the
better
than
average
category
for
witbier
the
orange
is
there
somewhere
in
the
background
but
not
as
prominent
as
i
might
have
expected
from
the
description
on
the
bottle
though
a
more
powerful
orange
character
would
have
probably
done
the
beer
more
harm
than
good
value
same
price
as
blue

yes
please
bleached
white
head
of
close
to
two
fingers
delicate
and
close
to
wispy
dissolves
rapidly
down
to
the
surface
forms
a
thin
sheet
along
the
glass
walls
almost
reminds
you
of
chain
mail
armor
credible
stickiness
given
its
thinness
dark
yellow
to
a
shade
before
orange
in
the
glass
would
likely
be
clearer
were
it
not
for
the
spice
particulate
floating
around
plenty
of
bubbles
larger
and
with
good
vigor
the
nose
on
the
whole
is
quiet
so
it
does
not
take
much
for
the
orange
zest
to
take
a
leading
position
theres
a
sweet
spice
presence
as
well
as
a
pinch
of
pepper
however
both
fade
into
the
fabric
the
wheat
notes
stick
in
your
mind
via
power
of
suggestion
turns
more
floral
as
it
warms
decent
peach
to
apricot
fruit
as
well
the
malts
likewise
folded
into
the
whole
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
gives
it
good
posture
and
increases
overall
mouth
presence
firmness
tends
to
carry
it
beyond
simple
quaffing
wit
this
may
be
for
the
better
or
worse
depending
on
your
expectations
the
orange
infusion
does
well
in
not
overplaying
its
hand
same
for
the
coriander
anise
seed
type
spices
the
honey
too
brings
needed
sweetness
but
within
a
thought
out
framework
the
malts
tastes
like
malt
as
in
malted
milk
balls
more
quinine
than
wheat
grain
or
yeast
flavors
not
herbaceously
bitter
ultimately
not
intellectually
interesting
however
no
problem
throwing
a
few
back
if
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summery
day
o
overall
this
is
a
decent
wit
but
nothing
i
would
purchase
again
decent
but
not
outstanding
beer
o
this
would
make
good
beach
beer
and
probably
would
work
well
at
the
ballpark
too
i
am
enjoying
it
for
what
it
is
easy
drinking
beer
for
people
with
a
soft
or
no
palate
overall
just
wasnt
impressed
in
any
one
aspect
of
this
beer
except
for
the
smell
but
i
cant
live
off
of
the
smell
alone
its
just
too
plain
and
uninspiring
for
me
to
try
again
tick
this
one
off
of
the
beer
list
but
thats
about
all
it
was
good
for
d
nothing
above
average
here
at
all
but
theres
nothing
offensive
at
all
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
going
to
go
out
of
the
way
to
seek
this
nice
seasonal
whit
nothing
crazy
but
nothing
to
turn
down
either
overall
i
found
the
orange
avenue
wit
very
very
easy
to
drink
and
extremely
refreshing
to
the
point
where
im
probably
going
to
be
picking
up
a
four
or
sixpack
sometime
soon
it
easily
held
onto
that
line
between
medicinal
and
quaffable
that
i
mentioned
before
being
deliciously
sweet
and
yet
still
managing
to
deliver
a
soft
kick
in
the
mouth
thanks
to
all
of
the
tangy
citrus
combined
with
the
heavier
wheat
this
is
very
much
a
summer
beer
though
it
is
just
as
fantastic
in
the
winter
helping
bring
back
that
warmth
that
everybody
longs
for
during
the
coldest

ended
up
rather
enjoying
it

not
my

it
had

orange

were

it

reminded

with

was
glad
to

it
worked

well
i
may
just
try
more
from
this
brewery
very
good
brew
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
a
small
friendly
white
head
which
falls
away
far
too
quickly
the
aroma

spicy
with

clove
orange
zest
and
a

zing
the
flavor
is
orangy

spicy
with
clove
and
allspice
and
there
is
a
good
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
but
in
between
there
is
a
watery
thinness
this
is
the
sweet
spot
that
cries
out
for
a
little
more
something
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
prickly
while
the
aromas
and
flavors
were
about
averagefor
the
style
this
one
comes
through
with
good
marks
on
drinkability
nonetheless
d
a
nice
wit
with
more
citrus
and
a
bit
less
spice
then
most
versions
i
found
this
to
be
enjoyable
with
a
very
reasonable
abv
this
is
a
wheat
beer
that
would
compliment
a
meal
becuase
of
the
mellow
spices
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
witbier

the

its
astringent
and
has
a
weird

that
is
offputting

a

the
ingredients
altogether

refreshingly

sip
with
a
touch

a
well
made
solidly
drinkable
beer
overall
a
very
quaffable
beer
a
nice
westcoast
adaptation
of
a
classic
belgian
style
though
i
might
have
called
it
wheat
rather
than
wit
as
color
and
spice
profile
are
significantly
different
from
witbier
i
would
recommend
giving
it
a
try

it
was
a
good
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
sweetness
its
not
really
my
type
of
beer
o
enjoyable
but
not
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
anchorage
overall
pleasant
flavor
but
it
drops
off
leaving
only
lemon

still
i
quite

this
is

it
seems

in
about
6
months
or
so
itll
be
perfect
but
unfortunately
i
believe
a
beer
should
be
ready
at
bottling
despite
this
nitpicking
this
is
still
a
pretty
tasty
beer
o
i
dont
know
if
i
happened
to
crack
this
bottle
at
the
right
time
or
what
but
this
is
amazing
i
cant
stop
taking
sips
its
so
damn
good
so
funky
in
the
aroma
and
initial
flavor
but
so
clean
in
the
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
absolutely
exquisite
more
of
a
sour
beer
to
me
than
a
witbier
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
brett
that
lends

of
an

along
with
minimal

and
that
brett
is
coming
through
a
touch
of
sweetness
in
this
one
for
some
reason
as
the
yeast
is
prevelant
and
helps
make
the
beer
fuller
bodied
and
smooth
the
spices
and
citric

are
there
and
the
brett
gives
it
a
nice
funky
taste
on
the
backbite
which
is
pleasant
an
interesting
beer
as
the
brett
addition
works
well
and
is
something
i
wouldnt
have
thought
would
work
with

it
adds

this
is

though
with

notes
i
am
not
sure
i
would
call
this
a
wit
beer
any
more
some
spicy
notes
of
peppercorn
could
be
removed
since
they
dont
really
bring
anything
valuable
to
the
whole

overall
a
delicious
witbier
that
really
seems
to
be
thrown
into
tweener
categorization
given
the
brett
and
age
on

bottle
funkier
than
a
traditional

which
gives
it
some
of
the

i
do
hope
that
anchorage
brews
another
batch
of
this
one
so
that
i
can
taste
it
fresh

that
doesnt
really

to

about

i
also
find
these

tend
to
not

this
is
a
very
nice
witbier
but
it
was
also
highly
expensive
but
definitely
worth
a
once
goaround
i
was
hoping
for
more
than
this
brought
to
the
table
not
really
bad
but
this
is
below
many
wheat
beers
in
my
opinion
the
previously
me
toned
whaleback
wit
is
a
perfect
example
o
very
enjoyable
my
wife
particularly
liked
it
appearance
is
doesnt
do
a
whole
lot
for
me
being
a
washed
out
yellow
with
an
effervescent
white
head
looks
too
much
like
an
industrial
lager
however
one
shouldnt
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
at
least
it
has
little
bubbles
rising
in
it
sort
of
like
champagne
strong
aroma
is
fruity
and
rather
sweet
more
like
a
cider
than
a
beer
maybe
the
chardonnay
barrels
imparted
this
flavor
is
oh
yeah
it
keeps
getting
better
a
malty
core
with
firm
fruity
and
yeasty
notes
rather
sweet
but
not
cloying
just
a
hint
of
grapes
and
a
subtle
sour
tone
lively
texture
has
plenty
of
fizz
though
body
seems
to
be
a
bit
lacking
overall
pretty
good
o
a
good
beer
with
above
average
drinkability
would
enjoy
this
one
after
a
meal
although
i
cannot
justify
the
price
being
quite
so
high
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
pours
a
straw
color
with
thick
foam
lots
of
brett
aromas
mixed
with
spice
and
wheaty
malts
lots
of
brett
flavor
also
slightly
bitter
citrus
and
spicy
pepper
its
dry
but
drinkable
it
has
a
lot
of
body
and
personality
just
a
bit
over
spiced
and
dry
for
me
nice
brew
its
intersting
enough
that
id
have
again
and
would
recommend
it
for
sure
overall
a
nice
wit
i
like
what
the
barrel
did
to
it
an
earlier
sample
had
more
predominant
brett
nice
light
body
and
modhigh
carbonation
picked
this
one
up
after
really
enjoying
the
galaxy
ipa
and
bitter
monk
this
was
bright
yellow
a
little
cloudy
smell
was
yeasty
with
just
a
hint
of
wine
barrel
not
bad
taste
had
some
lemon
to
it
a
bit
of
the
chardonnay
some
brett
but
overall
it
was
still
a
wit
and
just
did
not
move
me
like
the
other
tow
anchorage
beers
ive
had
id
buy
bitter
monk
again
if
i
see
it
and
id
love
to
try
the
lovebuzz
saison
but
i
would
not
buy
this
one
again
especially
for
15
o
certainly
an
interesting
wit
this
beer
is
very
dry
for
the
style
with
a
nice
fruitiness
and
lemon
and
wheat
character
as
it
warms
the
wine
barrel
comes
out
more
and
balances
the
beer
out
nicely
o
this
is
a
nice
witbier
anchorage
continues
to
impress
with
unique
and
delicious
beers
the
beer
pours
a
clear
piss
yellow
with
no
haze
and
a
disappointingly
thin
white
head
for
a
wit
there
is
no
lacing
or
sediment
the
nose
is
pleasant
and
sweet
with
a
bretty
funkiness
and
white
winecitrusy
tartness
as
the
beer
warms
the
citrus
becomes
more
pronounced
however
the
the
taste
is
relatively
weak
and
disappointing
brett
predominates
the
flavor
profile
with
a
mild
lingering
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
completely
watery
and
weak
although
the
flavors
are
balanced
and
drinkable
overall
this
isnt
worth
the
price
15
nor
worth
cellaring
amazing
im
pretty
sure
its
impossible
for
anchorage
to
produce
anything
less
than
extraordinary
its
another
magical
and
whimsical
ale
that
uses
a
lot
of
traditional
and
indigenous
flavors
but
combines
them
in
neuvo
rustic
charm
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
with
soft
carbonation
that
sweeps
across
the
tongue
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
o
im
not
too
big
of
a
witbier
fan
but
im
on
a
new
tip
of
trying
beers
from
styles
i
normally
neglect
i
guess
starting
off
my
witbier
samplings
with
anchorage
was
a
great
idea
very
good
i
could
drink
this
all
day
awesome
drinkability
is
very
high
a
fantastic
wit
i
thought
anchor
was
my
favorite
but
hes
pushed
it
again
with
a
whole
rewrite
and
came
out
with
a
homerun
this
is
my
first
beer
from
anchorage
brewing
company
im
rather
impressed
you
dont
see
many
brettinfused
wine
barrelaged
witbiers
i
like
the
trailblazing
character
of
this
one
even
better
its
good
beer
there
is
quite
a
bit
going
on
but
the
flavors
all
work
well
together
if
youre
looking
to
check
out
anchorage
brewing
company
this
seems
like
a
fine
place
to
start
the
label
gives
one
the
impression
that
this
is
some
monster
of
a
brew
but
the
truth
is
that
it
is
a
delicate
pretty
well
balanced
witbier
that
i
would
be
happy
to
have
again
shared
this
one
while
hanging
out
by
the
pool
in
florida
with
the
aasher
wedding
party
poured
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
wood
spice
tart
and
earthy
funk
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
funk
earth
and
wood
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
there
was
something
a
little
offputting
on
this
one
most
of
the
things
i
have
had
from
anchorage
have
been
spot
on
however
the
addition
of
brett
to
a
witbier
might
have
been
a
little
much
for
my
palate
as
they
didnt
blend
as
well
as
some
ive
had
in
the
past
still
fairly
tasty
but
nothing
standoutish
worth
trying
but
that
is
about
it
overall
impression
i
dont
care
for
this
at
all
o
this
is
another
beer
that
seems
somewhat
uneven
not
bad
but
not
as
good
as
others
of
the
style
e
g
allagash
white
still
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
witbier
saison
belgian
pale
wild
ale
whatever
you
wanna
call
it
this
is
refined
and
delicious
i
wish
i
had
more
bottles
of
this
the
only
sour
andor
funky
witbier
thats
better
than
this
is
2011
boulevard
two
jokers
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
brewer
comes
with
an
impressive
pedigree
and
i
am
excited
to
try
more
of
their
beers
d
very
drinkable
really
nice
complex
witbier
beer
with
the
brett
flavor
really
blended
in
nicely
super
crisp
and
refreshing
as
well
o
quite
a
disappointment
for
me
just
no
where
near
as
flavorful
as
id
hoped
and
the
watery
body
doesnt
help
ill
look
for
a
second
bottle
in
the
future
in
the
hopes
this
was
a
fluke
batch
1
pours
a
very
hazy
bright
golden
straw
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
scent
is
holy
shit
pardon
my
french
but
that
was
the
first
thing
i
thought
this
thing
is
beyond
funkier
than
i
was
expecting
definitely
the
funkiest
aroma
of
all
the
anchorage
beers
i
hate
to
say
it
because
i
like
the
aroma
but
it
reminds
me
of
farts
at
first
you
get
a
stinky
fartlike
aroma
with
a
hint
of
bile
then
i
get
some
delightful
brett
funk
with
lemon
and
citrus
very
crazy
yet
favorable
aroma
as
it
warms
the
chardonnay
barrel
really
comes
through
taste
is
initially
light
and
crisp
refreshing
like
a
classic
witbier
or
berliner
a
lot
of
wheat
flavor
with
lemon
and
some
tart
brett
flavors
nice
chardonnay
flavor
tons
of
barnyard
and
some
floral
flavors
finish
is
packed
with
pepper
and
light
hops
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
i
could
see
the
aroma
of
this
beer
turning
people
off
but
im
a
man
who
loves
some
funk
in
his
barrelaged
wild
yeast
beers
great
beer
sounds
spk
metal
field
pours
an
apple
juice
hue
which
leaves
a
wispy
fast
vanishing
one
finger
heaad
and
little
lacingthe
smell
is
typical
brett
along
with
mustspice
and
barnhouse
funkthe
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
thirst
quenching
with
tastes
of
citrus
zestapple
juicewhite
grapesa
slight
mustinessa
touch
of
funk
and
finished
with
white
grape
dryness
and
overall
its
alright
and
nice
for
a
hot
summers
day
but
would
not
buy
again
in
a
hurry
o
a
really
really
nice
beer
just
slightly
under
what
i
get
from
fantome
saison
its
right
in
that
ballpark
i
really
wish
i
could
have
tried
bitter
monk
fresh
but
now
that
i
tried
this
im
gonna
find
a
bottle
with
the
faded
hops
and
see
how
it
goes
o
a
well
made
wit
with
brett
light
malt
light
hops
barrell
aged
another
great
brew
from
anchorage
i
love
every
other
beer
anchorage
has
made
so
im
surprisingly
underwhelmed
by
this
offering
needs
to
be
more
sour
to
keep
up
with
the
others
for
sure
and
could
really
use
either
some
complimentary
hops
or
more
wit
spices
in
addition
to
more
souring
jd
difficult
to
rate
as
it
sort
of
throws
the
style
guidelines
out
the
window
if
you
like
tart
funky
renditions
of
classicaly
refreshing
ales
this
will
be
perfect
for
you
but
i
dont
think
these
elements
should
dominate
the
base
beer
as
much
as
they
do
here
o
brutally
sour
to
me
i
cant
handle
this
one
o
while
very
enjoyable
not
an
easy
drinker
or
very
sessionable
beer
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
there
is
very
little
bitterness
but
somehow
this
beer
felt
a
little
like
work
to
drink
o
this
beer
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
styleits
not
as
refreshing
compared
to
other
witbiers
but
the
brettanomyces
and
wine
barrel
aging
give
it
unique
flavors
this
was
another
interesting
effort
from
anchorage
unlike
the
other
two
we
tried
here
this
one
seemed
to
put
the
base
witbier
more
at
the
forefront
but
it
didnt
override
the
wild
and
barrel
character
just
allowing
them
to
an
extra
layer
of
refreshing
complimentary
flavor
to
this
o
the
brett
dominates
especially
in
the
nose
but
that
is
a
good
thing
the
bright
lemony
character
is
a
bit
flurried
but
everything
seems
to
work
together
while
this
is
not
what
comes
to
mind
personally
so
of
course
its
subjective
and
you
can
dismiss
this
statement
when
i
think
of
a
wit
it
still
is
a
great
interpretation
and
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
this
is
very
close
to
a
4
5
overall
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
level
of
carbonation
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
an
interesting
arrangement
of
character
this
brew
starts
off
a
little
ackward
but
pulls
itself
together
a
bit
as
it
warms
up
and
breaths
dont
rush
yourself
through
this
brew
give
it
a
chance
without
writing
it
of
after
a
single
tick
i
mean
sip
this
beer
is
just
a
terrible
mash
up
of
flavors
an
extremely
good
wit
the
brett
on
this
does
make
it
different
since
i
generally
love
sour
characteristics
its
fine
by
me
but
this
may
not
work
for
a
lot
of
people
that
said
this
is
and
has
been
enjoyable
with
a
real
refreshing
style
o
i
think
this
beer
is
really
good
i
havent
seen
this
beer
hit
the
shelves
in
buffalo
yet
but
if
it
was
there
id
pick
up
a
bottle
im
really
enjoying
what
anchorage
is
doing
with
their
bottled
beers
o
not
much
wheaty
wit
character
or
spicy
phenols
funky
which
is
not
traditional
for
a
wit
these
is
when
becoming
a
style
whore
does
not
help
brewing
creativity
this
is
a
great
beer
but
does
not
really
fall
into
the
traditional
definition
of
a
wit
beer
nevertheless
the
time
and
effort
that
went
into
creating
this
triple
fermented
beer
was
well
spent
i
love
it
drink
for
a
1st
offering
from
anchorage
this
was
pretty
good
id
give
the
other
two
beers
that
every
one
raves
a
bot
a
chance
but
i
am
dont
think
i
am
willing
to
drop
20
on
them
yet
split
a
bomber
of
this
with
a
friend
cool
looking
bottle
and
story
on
the
glass
pours
a
golden
yellow
plenty
of
carbonation
and
head
to
it
sharp
fruity
aroma
to
it
taste
is
very
winelike
with
a
nice
wit
background
supposedly
its
aged
on
chardonnay
barrels
which
you
can
definitely
taste
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
more
recommended
for
people
who
enjoy
winechampagne
but
solid
none
the
less
also
first
time
ive
had
an
alaskan
beer
750
ml
bottle
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
lasting
white
head
aromas
of
straw
lemon
barnyard
funk
wheat
white
wine
floral
notes
light
oak
and
light
coriander
palate
was
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
flavors
of
straw
lemon
barnyard
funk
peppeer
white
wine
light
coriander
and
light
oak
with
a
crisp
dry
lingering
funky
citrus
finish
this
is
great
i
love
the
mix
of
brett
oak
and
wine
barrels
here
it
works
perfectly
unlike
with
bitter
monk
where
nothing
but
hops
come
through
i
would
love
to
share
this
with
a
wine
drinker
to
see
what
they
think
highly
recommended
this
one
is
a
little
bit
heavy
handed
with
the
spices
for
me
but
it
is
a
wellmade
beer
quite
complex
and
interesting
i
really
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
options
that
are
available
from
anchorage
o
one
of
the
better
witbiers
ive
had
clearly
the
brett
and
barrel
aging
help
this
one
thin
highly
carbonated
refreshing
mouthfeel
that
works
for
a
delicate
beer
like
this
highly
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
something
different
also
not
like
any
other
witbier
ive
had
o
havent
had
this
style
in
a
while
nice
refreshing
drink
flavors
were
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
would
have
wanted
them
but
still
a
good
blend
making
for
a
nice
drink
cheers
notes
an
interesting
beer
tasty
for
sure
a
little
more
restrained
on
the
brett
than
bitter
monk
and
lovebuzz
which
i
appreciate
shows
more
balance
and
finesse
o
not
sure
what
to
think
about
this
one
i
guess
its
a
wit
by
style
but
nothing
really
noticeable
of
a
wit
with
the
brett
added
not
a
fan
o
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
had
the
brett
wasnt
as
potent
as
i
was
expecting
but
it
added
a
nice
dimension
to
the
flavor
the
white
wine
barrels
adds
a
nice
light
vinous
quality
and
dried
out
the
mouth
in
a
way
that
i
felt
was
an
improvement
over
other
heavier
sweeter
wits
ive
had
recommended
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
yet
durable
white
head
on
top
the
head
had
a
strong
retention
that
lasted
for
quite
a
while
the
lacing
was
minimal
though
the
smell
of
the
lemon
zest
and
french
oak
were
the
strongest
aromas
i
could
pick
up
the
faint
aromas
of
spices
were
in
there
too
the
smell
of
the
oak
made
me
think
this
beer
was
going
to
be
much
more
sour
or
tart
but
to
my
surprise
it
was
actually
pretty
mellow
the
flavors
had
a
good
amount
of
wheat
notes
along
with
the
oak
and
spice
in
the
mix
the
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
also
nice
and
light
bodied
fairly
refreshing
also
overall
this
beer
was
pretty
good
id
probably
drink
it
again
but
im
more
excited
to
try
some
of
anchorages
other
brews
they
put
out
now
this
was
my
first
alaskan
beer
and
i
enjoyed
it
looking
forward
to
having
more
from
that
state
some
day
overall
this
beer
could
use
some
balance
to
counter
the
chardonnay
sweetness
but
is
still
pretty
impressive
another
solid
offering
from
this
up
and
coming
brewery
14
a
bottle
make
it
a
tough
call
but
its
top
notch
for
style
even
if
it
especially
blurs
the
style
line
but
its
for
the
better
t
very
dry
and
light
lemon
rind
baby
aspirin
hints
of
brett
and
some
white
pepper
i
really
loved
this
one
nice
challenging
beer
but
also
refreshing
lots
to
like
in
this
verrrry
interesting
beer
you
pour
it
and
expect
a
witbier
but
you
smell
it
you
taste
it
and
you
get
this
bretted
out
funkotron
foremost
aroma
sulfur
i
imagine
from
the
chardonnay
barrels
the
taste
upfront
is
a
mild
wheat
and
then
theres
a
long
middle
and
aftertaste

off

of

the
brett
makes
it
an
almost
overwhelmingfor
me
beer
great
for
a
new
experience
o
overall
some
interesting
twists
flavor
wise
especially
from
the
chardonnay
barrel
aging
though
equally
as
strange
to
be
utilized
with
this
style
as
well
nice
visual
the
nose
a
bit
weak

wise
as
well
the
mouthful
a

overall
feels
about
good
here
with
a
moderate
drinkability
though
mostly
curious
with
a
bomber
playing
well
m
o
delightful
high
carbonation
with
a
succuelent
citrusspice
wine
finish
that
turns
dry
and
slightly
fruity
towards
the
very
end
incredibly
fun
to
drink
i
love
this
brewery
highly
recommended
but
know
what
youre
getting
into
much
like
bitter
monk
this
really
blows
away
the
base
style
and
transforms
into
something
wonderful
highly
recommended
anchorage
is
doing
great
work
right
out
of
the
gate
o
i
am
not
a
stickler
for
style
at
all
but
i
think
for
something
to
go
out
of
style
it
must
be
really
showing
me
something
in
terms
of
flavor
this
one
comes
off
a
bit
convoluted
despite
being
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
theres
more
chardonnay
than
witbier
in
this
for
me
and
i
wish
it
was
the
other
way
around
that
said
perhaps
holding
on
to
a
case
of
all
these
new
anchorage
beers
wouldnt
be
a
bad
investment
the
problem
of
course
being
that
all
of
these
are
15
a
bottle
not
sure
the
beer
currently
justifies
the
price
but
thats
my
only
real
gripe
quite
good
just
not
of
the
higher
tier
unfortunately
not
the
best
glass
in
the
world
but
when
you
pack
up
to
move
you
use
what
you
can
get
this
beer
pours
a
pale
lemon
yellow
with
a
decent
2
inch
bright
white
cap
that
leaves
just
a
little
bit
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
after
i
popped
the
top
hints
of
must
and
grandmas
old
attic
closet
waft
my
way
nice
brett
aroma
as
it
gets
closer
to
the
sniffer
the
brett
comes
across
as
damp
earth
and
musty
closest
hints
of
lemon
peel
and
spice
just
a
little
bit
of
pepper
the
flavor
is
fantastic
light
and
crisp
the
brett
is
damp
wet
earth
with
must
and
a
bit
of
barnyard
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
coriander
really
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
saison
or
funky
bdg
then
a
wit
really
fantastic
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
lacking
with
as
much
brett
i
thought
it
would
finish
a
bit
drier
then
it
does
i
was
lucky
enough
to
try
this
right
after
it
came
out
at
a
tasting
and
i
was
extremely
impressed
with
it
i
was
happy
to
see
a
lonely
sitting
on
the
shelf
of
one
of
my
locals
o
not
too
bad
not
great
decent
ill
hope
for
the
best
and
open
a
bottle
in
a
few
months
or
so
to
see
how
this
one
is
progressing
im
hoping
it
gets
better
holy
shit
is
this
good
complex
but
great
balance
wish
i
had
another
bottle
15
out
here
in
ma
and
worth
the
trip
from
ak
these
guys
know
what
they
are
doing
a
terrific
wit
a
decent
belgian
style
witbier
with
significant
interesting
sweetness
from
the
brett
fruity
and
interesting
and
different
very
good
for
the
style
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
good
drinkability
a
great
bottle
to
share
and
accompany
a
good
meal
thanks
ryan
i
love
beers
like
this
beers
that
push
the
boundaries
and
which
do
it
with
such
poise
sophistication
and
style
as
for
anchorage
brewing
company
i
only
have
to
give
a
warning
to
jolly
pumpkinyour
awesome
tostyle
funkladen
alchemy
has
a
new
competitor
anchorage
brewing
wow
keep
killing
it
o
incredibly
suprised
by
this
beer
super
drinkable
wish
this
was
a
bit
cheaper
than
it
is
priced
but
still
worth
a
try
glad
i
bought
this
o
this
is
overly
carbonated
which
all
but
cancels
out
what
might
other
wise
be
a
plethora
of
subtle
flavors
its
distractingly
crisp
still
whiteout
is
quite
good
even
if
its
not
nearly
as
funky
as
the
nose
would
have
you
believe
also
ive
no
knack
for
grammar
but
coriander
corriander
is
spelled
wrong
on
the
bottle
haha
notes
quite
a
surprise
another
visiting
brew
given
the
local
beer
week
at
the
time
i
guess
quite
an
unexpected
treat
to
find
this
on
the
shelf
in
any
case
pricing
while
not
overwhelming
is
a
touch
steep
but
when
barrelaging
and
brett
are
involved
this
seems
to
be
the
common
case
other
than
that
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
and
stimulating
brew
o
i
dont
particularly
gravitate
to
this
style
but
this
beer
is
pretty
tasty
and
complex
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
though
but
i
think
its
worth
a
try
not
a
bad
beer
i
took
my
first
few
sips
when
it
was
just
out
of
the
fridge
and
all
i
got
was
the
brett
funk
and
a
lot
of
skunkiness
letting
comes
to
temperature
helped
it
out
a
lot
a
good
solid
beer
but
not
really
anything
to
get
terribly
excited
about
either
a
random
case
o
this
found
its
way
to
my
most
local
haunt
and
i
just
had
to
try
it
it
pours
a
clear
palegolden
straw
topped
by
a
healthy
cap
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
white
vinegar
brett
funk
tart
lemon
sour
mandarin
orange
light
white
wine
coriander
and
cardamom
the
taste
holds
notes
of
bretty
cobweb
dry
lemon
peel
musty
lemonade
light
honey
coriander
cardamom
cedar
and
a
touch
of
spicy
grape
the
lemon
starts
out
as
a
daggerprick
of
tartness
but
then
falls
off
into
a
moldy
version
of
the
fruit
where
it
malingers
for
a
bit
only
to
die
off
completely
in
the
finish
something
here
doesnt
sit
right
with
me
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dry
fairly
sticky
finish
overall
this
was
an
interesting
brew
one
that
partially
succeeds
and
partially
fails
after
a
short
bit
of
research
i
think
i
pinpointed
the
source
of
the
strange
flavor
sorachi
my
old
nemesis
alright
that
would
explain
things
a
bit
beyond
my
hate
for
this
hop
and
all
that
it
does
to
lay
waste
to
beers
flavors
this
wasnt
too
bad
kinda
interested
to
see
what
a
bit
of
age
does
to
it
now
one
of
my
colleagues
spoke
longingly
of
trying
some
of
anchorage
brewing
companys
beers
touting
that
they
age
their
beers
in
french
oak
chardonnay
barrels
which
sounded
lovely
triple
fermented
brett
yeast
yeah
once
i
learned
that
my
friend
works
with
the
graphic
designer
for
abcs
labels
i
had
to
try
some
im
partial
to
a
great
belgian
witbier
so
picked
up
a
cold
750
ml
of
whiteout
its
a
solid
beer
all
around
a
nice
twist
on
a
witbier
poured
a
cloudy
whitegold
with
a
pillowy
head
and
moderate
lacing
a
lot
of
orange
peel
in
the
smell
the
taste
three
flavors
really
stood
out
black
peppercorn
and
the
brett
yeast
but
really
that
chardonnay
flavor
from
the
aging
popped
out
so
much
that
my
cousin
a
big
wine
dude
wanted
to
open
a
bottle
of
a
california
chardonnay
hed
been
sitting
on
and
taste
the
two
sidebyside
we
passed
a
little
too
much
for
a
sunday
afternoon
watching
baseball
but
it
would
be
a
cool
experiment
could
pair
this
with
roasted
salmon
or
a
summers
salad
or
even
a
great
cheese
plate
had
an
intense
artisanal
grilled
cheese
with
heirloom
tomatoes
alongside
whiteout
and
the
acidity
of
the
tomatoes
and
the
sharpness
of
the
cheese
matched
the
peppery
flavors
of
the
beer
perfectly
a
solid
first
dive
into
anchorage
looking
forward
to
trying
their
saison
next
750ml
corked
and
caged
bottle
served
in
a
blvd
tank
7
tulip
pours
a
pale
straw
with
a
quickly
dissipating
white
head
nice
bretty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
oak
light
bodied
starts
off
with
a
lot
of
wood
decent
tartness
fairly
dry
and
crisp
oak
fades
a
little
but
still
lingers
in
the
finish
very
drinkable
i
thought
the
oak
was
a
little
strong
at
first
but
it
grew
on
me
o
this
is
a
good
brew
it
would
be
nice
during
the
summer
time
for
sure
very
refreshing
citrusy
and
crisp
d
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
a
little
more
brett
presence
would
help
but
still
tasty
overall
great
nice
light
belgian
malts
and
wheat
light
spices
are
nice
and
not
overpowering
nice
brett
character
overall
this
is
pretty
interesting
relatively
light
and
fairly
enjoyable
if
it
was
cheap
i
might
consider
it
as
a
nice
alternative
summer
beer
the
medley
of
flavors
blend
together
to
make
a
very
enjoyable
beer
o
no
one
at
the
tasting
liked
this
im
completely
mystified
by
its
high
score
actually
considering
its
rarity
and
price
tag
im
not
15
for
this
please
d
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
and
the
spice
character
is
quite
understated
which
i
prefer
theres
perhaps
a
bit
too
much
in
the
way
of
buttery
oak
and
wine
influence
but
i
imagine
over
time
the
brett
character
will
grow
in
strength
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
this
is
good
exceeded
my
expectations
all
around
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
more
brett
influenced
rr
temptation
o
was
looking
forward
to
this
but
its
pretty
pedestrian
and
not
worth
15
overall
it
is
refreshing
interesting
light
and
nice
i
would
seek
this
out
again
for
sure
this
is
a
pleasant
drinking
witbier
but
unusual
with
lemon
and
chardonnay
grape
flavors
that
are
uncharacteristic
of
the
style
could
be
a
light
saison
in
the
style
of
fantome
this
beer
is
also
clearer
than
typical
witbiers
in
any
case
an
interesting
interpretation
and
one
that
shows
a
lot
of
thought
and
care
in
the
making
pours
a
slightly
hazy
super
light
yellow
with
a
2
inch
puffy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
craggy
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
lemons
and
the
funky
brett
smell
taste
is
of
buttered
wheat
bread
lemon
peel
subtle
spices
and
some
slight
funky
flavors
i
have
read
that
butter
flavors
arent
desirable
in
beer
but
i
am
really
enjoying
this
flavor
the
barrel
aging
in
the
wine
barrels
is
evident
as
a
fruity
woodiness
there
is
a
a
good
level
of
carbontion
with
a
dry
crisp
mouthfeel
on
this
one
overall
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
from
this
upstart
brewery
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
had
i
will
for
sure
be
seeking
out
more
offerings
from
this
brewery
in
the
future
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
ive
never
tried
anything
from
anchorage
but
im
interested
to
try
more
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
for
the
style
pretty
thin
and
nicely
carbed
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
doesnt
come
around
too
often
pushing
boundaries
and
exploring
new
opportunities
while
still
making
a
delicious
beer
overall
not
great
maybe
with
some
age
this
could
mellow
out
a
bit
but
for
now
its
probably
more
useful
to
spread
on
your
skin
for
a
sunny
day
at
the
beach
as
the
spf
is
no
doubt
pretty
high
beer
is
light
in
body
and
very
carbonated
on
the
palate
sweet
mild
funk
very
mild
good
yeast
character
mild
spice
the
beer
goes
down
easy
overall
it
is
a
fine
beer
i
enjoyed
it
i
thought
the
brett
character
which
was
played
up
on
the
label
was
minimal
but
thats
what
i
wanted
tonight
id
have
it
again
a
unique
experience
though
in
my
opinion
not
worth
purchasing
again
give
it
a
try
you
may
like
it
the
cpj
sampled
at
julios
belgian
beer
fest
on
august

2011
the
pour
is
a
milky
oliveyellow
with
a
bubbly
burst
of
fizzy
head
it
looks
the
part
but
as
i
discovered
it
did
not
act
the
part
on
the
nose
there
were
aromas
of
weak
malts
and
an
acidic
zesty
fruitiness
the
body
was
lightweight
the
taste
tended
to
be
very
tart
with
grapefuit
or
pineapple
flavors
overwhelming
everything
else
there
was
a
thin
hop
finish
but
that
took
a
lot
of
energy
to
find
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
overall
i
really
enjoyed
it
the
brett
was
pretty
bold
for
the
style
but
i
liked
how
it
mixed
with
the
wit
character
very
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
beer
overall
mildly
hazy

with
a

and
a

by
a
hint

a
touch
of

and
hints
of
chardonnay
the
chardonnay
notes
seem
to
blend
well
with
the
fruity
bubblegummy
yeasty
notes
i
am
actually
getting
a
lot
of
traditional

here
taste
seems
natural
and
very
wellbalanced
peppery
wheattwang
and
spice
with
suggestions
of
fruit
and

in

a

very
well
done
and
understated
in
an
elegant
kind
of
way
lightmedium

clean

minimal

overall
a
great
beer
wish
this
was
a
bit
cheaper
it
could
easily
become
a
goto
summer
sessionable
for
me
if
it
was
less
expensive
very
very
well
made
but
for
some
reason
didnt
totally
turn
my
gears
excited
to
see
the
future
of
anchorage
great
first
effort
nice
light
feel
with
soft
carbonation
overall
pretty
decent
here
i
feel
like
it
has
some
off
aromas
but
otherwise
this
one
is
pretty
tasty
a
little
unexciting
and
the
aromas
the
only
real
qualm
that
i
have
here
i
like
this
one
its
kind
of
pricey
but
quite
complex
in
the
taste
overall
quite
entertaining
but
it
sort
of
does
not
remind
me
of
witbeer
lemon
and
fruity
citrus
seems
to
be
burried
i
never
get
coriander
off
of
witbeers
so
i
cant
comment
on
not
missing
that
but
there
you
have
it
overall
not
bad
one
unique
tasting
brew
therefore
i
call
quite
good
overall
overall
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
at
15
i
have
no
desire
to
try
it
again
still
nice
to
try
once
pours
a
cloudy
semibright
yellow
color
with
a
good
twofinger
white
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
bready
with
a
slight
sulfur
character
it
smells
a
bit
like
a
fermenting
berliner
weiss
behind
that
is
a
bit
of
coriander
and
citrus
plus
faint
earthiness
the
flavor
is
wheaty
with
a
good
citrus
character
and
a
good
earthy
presence
mouthfeel
is
the
best
aspect
with
the
barrel
character
and
brett
really
coming
through
for
a
nice
body
and
dry
finish
well
done
and
a
fantastic
summer
sipper
a
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
but
if
this
were
in
sixpacks
for
1012
id
be
drinking
it
all
summer
long
o
an
absolutely
phenomenal
beer
nothing
traditional
about
it
but
nothing
boring
either
im
comparing
this
mentally
to
the
ba
wit
that
upright
did
this
is
better
i
followed
up
a
14
month
old
bottle
of
orval
with
this
whiteout
held
its
own
in
terms
of
flavor
and
complexity
at
about
12
a
bottle
this
is
an
utter
steal
well
done
mr
fletcher
well
done
4
55
theres
no
question
that
in
terms
of
uniqueness
this
beer
deserves
a
perfect
5
as
far
as
how
palatable
it
actually
is
however
thats
another
matter
for
the
first
time
in
years
ive
found
a
beer
thats
truly
unfamiliar
to
me
but
im
not
so
sure
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
id
say
the
combination
of
witbier
pepper
lemon
wild
yeast
and
chardonnay
barrel
is
not
exactly
an
ideal
one
although
id
be
happy
to
try
it
again
provided
someone
else
foots
the
bill
barrel
aged
white
ale
sounds
good
to
me
color
is
a
very
pale
gold
with
about
two
fingers
of
solid
heading
the
nose
is
lightly
sour
and
funky
almost
like
sticking
your
nose
in
to
a
jar
of
pickled
eggs
the
sour
is
not
as
pronounced
in
the
flavor
but
the
funk
sticks
around
it
also
comes
off
bone
dry
in
places
i
especially
get
the
black
pepper
and
the
chardonnay
barrel
influence
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
i
love
bottle
conditioned
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
i
could
drink
this
white
all
day
all
i
can
say
is
that
after
trying
this
brew
i
cannot
freaking
wait
to
see
what
they
come
up
with
next
ok
so
that
ignored
all
of
the
irrelevant
and
frivolous
external
factors
contributing
to
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
however
first
really
mr
fletcher
silk
screening
your
face
on
your
bottle
blech
out
of
your
control
though
is
what
happens
once
the
beer
ends
up
in
the
distribution
pipeline
for
7
99
i
would
happily
buy
cases
of
this
beer
heck
for
11
99
i
would
but
by
the
time
shelton
bros
and
the
shitty
mddc
distributor
for
them
get
their
hands
on
it
i
cant
rationalize
paying
17
99
plus
tax
for
this
particular
beer
bummer
my
loss
overall
this
is
the
most
original
take
on
the
wit
style
that
ive
tasted
im
really
impressed
with
this
first
outing
from
the
anchorage
brewing
company
looking
forward
to
what
they
come
up
with
next
edit
batch

may
2011
brettastic
first
release
from
gary
a
light
sessionable
wit
with
a
really
great
funky
and
tart
character
i
hope
to
get
a
couple
more
to
sit
on
for
awhile
and
see
what
happens
i
knew
this
guy
would
kick
off
with
a
killer
start
its
an
amazing
feat
to
be
able
to
brew
such
specialty
beers
and
actually
distribute
them
ofirst
beer
ive
tried
from
this
new
brewery
and
i
am
definitely
a
fan
cant
wait
to
see
what
they
come
out
with
next
o
a
really
interesting
intriguing
beer
im
not
aware
of
other
examples
of
soured
wit
beers
and
it
seems
like
something
which
could
easily
have
gone
wrong
but
it
works
well
in
this
beer
ive
got
another
bottle
that
im
going
to
age
for
a
while
and
see
how
it
develops
in
summary
this
beer
is
another
masterpiece
from
gabe
fletcher
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
a
beer
that
would
be
a
better
choice
for
a
warm
summers
day
or
as
an
aperitif
before
a
fine
dinner
or
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
nice
salad
run
dont
walk
to
buy
this
beer
at
less
than
9
a
bottle
its
ridiculously
reasonable
and
if
youre
in
to
beer
trading
this
stuff
will
be
worth
its
weight
in
gold
or
at
least
in
beers
from
the
east
coast
once
again
i
have
to
tip
my
hat
to
gabe
well
played
sir
well
played
i
cant
wait
to
taste
the
next
beer
that
emerges
from
his
creative
genius
im
a
big
fan
of
midnight
sun
where
gabe
the
one
man
show
behind
anchorage
brewing
company
was
the
brewmaster
for
quite
a
while
i
even
judeged
ipas
at
a
homebrew
competition
with
him
once
but
im
not
as
wild
about
wits
or
bret
that
said
gabe
has
pretty
much
hit
the
spot
with
this
first
bottled
offering
from
anchorage
brewing
company
this
is
by
far
the
most
complex
and
interesting
wit
ive
ever
had
and
it
is
incredibly
well
balanced
i
am
very
impressed
and
thankful
that
we
got
a
few
cases
in
my
little
remote
town
i
made
my
notes
before
i
read
the
bottle
i
picked
up
on
the
lemon
peel
easily
but
the
corriander
and
peppercorns
slipped
by
me
very
solid
the
tart
and
acidic
fruits
work
well
and
i
like
the
the
ultra
high
carbonation
here
another
well
done
beer
from
crooked
stave
o
good
fubky
refreshing
beer
o
an
excellent
americanized
version
of
a
witbier
likeable
and
easy
to
drink
provided
you
like
sweet
stuff
overall
another
really
good
beer
from
crooked
stave
lots
of
flavor
and
incredibly
refreshing
this
is
the
perfect
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
kind
of
light
in
the
nose
but
the
flavor
is
fantastic
lemon
orange
sweetness
some
barnyard
funk
along
with
a
pleasant
tart
sour
definitely
embodies
the
summer
label
good
dry
finish
and
very
drinkable
another
great
brew
from
crooked
stave
o
very
enjoyable
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
a
very
well
constructed
brew
with
a
great
brett
presence
highly
recommend
also
how
in
the
hell
is
this
a
witbier
its
sour
as
hell
this
brew
kicks
serious
ass
crooked
stave
is
producing
sheer
awesomeness
highly
recommended
klight
to
medium
bodied
with
modest
carbonation
has
a
tart
citrus
aftertaste
this
is
perhaps
the
most
unique
witbier
i
have
ever
had
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
lighter
end
of
medium
body
with
a
nice
dry
musty
brett
presence
thats
well
integrated
into
the
elements
of
the
base
beer
not
as
exciting
as
the
aroma
suggests
with
subtle
funk
earthy
hop
grass
and
straw
along
with
peppery
spice
sourdough
bread
and
light
fruit
notes
some
coriander
and
ginger
along
with
banana
bread
wild
yeast
citrus
rind
and
light
fruit
decent
but
somewhat
of
a
let
down
considering
the
complexity
and
appeal
of
the
aroma
o
easily
a
great
witbier
with
the
brett
addition
to
mix
it
up
a
good
level
of
funkiness
with
the
zesty
citrus
brings
a
nice
feel
to
the
beer
overall
i
had
really
high
hopes
for
this
but
it
was
kind
of
a
let
down
not
as
much
funk
as
id
hoped
for
no
sparkle
whatsoever
and
fairly
bland
for
a
bottle
that
cost
8
99
this
was
o
k
but
nothing
ill
be
seeking
out
again
overall
i
have
had
cs
multiple
times
and
i
finally
found
a
chemical
bomb
just
horrible
i
had
it
on
tap
and
it
was
amazing
but
this
bottle
did
not
age
well
i
will
go
back
to
crooked
stave
soon
though
as
the
name
suggests
this
beer
has
a
heavy
emphasis
on
the
brett
but
i
wouldnt
label
it
as
a
brett
bomb
it
has
some
balance
thanks
to
some
nice
fruit
flavors
its
definitely
worth
a
try
a
fun
interesting
and
flavorpacked
wit
its
pretty
drinkable
even
if
theres
not
much
to
it
beyond
the
brettbomb
i
love
the
funkiness
but
some
additional
spice
or
body
or
anything
would
add
a
little
balance
and
counterintuitively
make
a
more
intense
beer
experience
wonderfully
refreshing
and
tart
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
to
enjoy
on
this
80
degree
socal
day
was
hoping
for
more
blood
orange
but
very
enjoyable
despite
that
fact
crooked
stave
continues
to
impress
overall
damn
if
this
is
not
your
typical
witbier
there
is
a
lot
of
citrus
undertones
and
a
nice
funk
its
probably
not
recognizable
as
a
witbier
since
well
its
100
brett
but
its
quite
interesting
and
enjoyable
to
drink
o
dont
buy
this
expecting
your
typical
witbier
falls
more
into
the
vague
wild
ale
category
for
me
which
is
more
what
i
rated
it
to
wonderful
crisp
refreshing
blend
of
flavors
glad
i
held
onto
it
for
about
6
months
before
having
will
be
picking
up
more
of
this
a
unique
take
on
the
belgian
witbier
100
brett
belgian
white
with
blood
oranges
and
aged
in
oak
it
is
nothing
like
a
belgian
wit
which
im
sure
they
dont
care
is
it
a
well
crafted
beer
but
not
exactly
one
that
i
would
want
to
replace
the
ever
so
drinkable
and
delicious
belgian
whites
with
also
it
is
too
expensive
for
what
this
is
brett
is
a
gamble
when
it
comes
to
storing
beer
and
while
ive
had
success
stories
with
it
this
was
definitely
far
less
smoky
dry
and
yeasty
tasting
when
i
had
it
fresh
i
was
only
about
a
month
or
two
off
from
the
soft
spot
but
hey
it
still
turned
out
fine
overall
while
this
wasnt
nearly
as
intense
as
a
bottle
of
vielle
i
had
a
while
back
its
definitely
on
its
way
there
need
some
cured
dried
meats
for
this
next
time
and
then
ill
be
good
to
go
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
goldenhay
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
thinly
coats
the
brew
throughout
drinking
and
leaves
some
sticky
lacing
the
nose
is
a
quite
tart
with
lemongrapefruit
citrusy
brett
funkiness
upfront
followed
by
notes
reminiscent
of
raw
mushrooms
and
spicy
baby
arugula
the
flavor
is
dominated
by
citrusy
brett
funk
some
grain
sweetness
and
a
tart
slightly
bitter
finish
it
has
a
juicy
lightmedium
body
with
citrus
notes
accenting
the
tart
semidry
bretty
finish
and
an
unexpected
lingering
bitterness
between
sips
im
very
pleased
with
this
beer
though
pricey
ive
already
requested
more
through
the
appropriate
channels
oa
nice
witbier
enjoyed
the
tart
and
funky
quality
m
medium
body
somewhat
creamy
moderate
carbonation
whats
not
to
love
all
about
the
brett
complex
yet
amazingly
drinkable
and
oh
so
refreshing
wish
i
could
get
this
by
the
six
pack
because
i
would
totally
session
it
all
day
a
really
nice
take
on
the
witbier
style
bottle
marked
batch
3
poured
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
pale
hazy
almost
opaque
lemon
yellow
coloring
with
a
sparse
wispy
filmy
surface
coat
of
head
steady
carbonation
flow
throughout
the
body
of
the
beer
aromas
of
tangy
cherry
citrus
and
tartsour
notes
subtle
but
what
is
there
on
the
nose
smells
solid
flavors
are
very
tart
forward
with
a
toasted
grain
backbone
cherry
tart
and
sweet
with
lemon
grass
blood
orange
and
lemon
highlights
the
tart
character
is
solid
throughout
and
transitions
to
an
astringent
dry
character
into
the
aftertaste
losing
much
of
the
fruity
notes
but
gaining
some
more
grain
and
green
characteristics
the
body
is
slightly
effervesced
on
the
palate
to
an
almost
sharp
feel
at
the
end
very
crisp
tart
finish
that
dries
and
cleans
your
taste
buds
readying
for
more
this
is
brett
to
the
letter
and
it
is
a
tasty
brew
absolutely
outstanding
crooked
stave
just
owns
this
style
of
beer
right
now
even
better
than
the
spring
version
this
pours
a
less
cloudy
than
anticipated
pale
yellow
color
with
a
lively
white
head
over
an
inch
tall
but
fading
pretty
fast
the
nose
is
really
bretty
sour
too
and
more
well
hopped
than
i
remember
the
other
one
being
its
got
a
defined
citrus
aroma
but
i
cant
pick
out
an
orange
type
specifically
musty
wheat
malt
base
the
flavor
matches
the
nose
but
is
way
more
sour
than
it
smells
acidity
is
somehow
tempered
by
the
wheat
malt
which
is
nice
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
bretty
funk
all
the
way
through
and
the
citrus
is
really
prominent
a
superior
quality
beer
in
every
way
special
stuff
here
soft
feel
but
super
carbonated
an
odd
combination
its
delicate
and
robust
at
the
same
time
i
would
drink
this
every
single
day
if
i
could
m
milky
smooth
minimal
carb
but
very
drinkable
lemony
yellow
body
with
a
light
white
head
limited
nose
with
some
lemony
tartness
this
beer
did
not
taste
like
a
witbier
the
brett
is
certainly
highlighted
but
is
taken
over
by
the
surprising
acidity
i
didnt
get
the
blood
orange
anywhere
or
really
even
the
brett
funk
that
i
expected
it
wasnt
bad
but
this
beer
did
not
deliver
on
any
of
the
notes
i
was
hoping
for
mouthfeeloverall
light
mouthfeel
with
high
carbonation
and
as
i
mentioned
above
dry
overall
it
combines
for
a
nice
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
sessionable
does
not
drink
to
its
abv
seems
more
in
the
4
5
range
overall
a
light
and
drinkable
beer
that
has
a
solid
amount
of
flavor
as
well
nothing
mind
blowing
but
it
still
leaves
me
with
a
good
impression
especially
taking
style
into
consideration
pumped
crooked
stave
started
distro
to
california
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
seasonal
varietals
of
this
beer
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
loved
the
nose
as
it
was
full
of
brett
and
orangescitrus
while
the
taste
had
more
spice
to
it
a
good
beer
id
definitely
have
again
though
if
im
paying
cs
prices
for
their
beers
id
prefer
hop
savant
to
this
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
fruit
yeast
and
brett
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
chalk
and
brett
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
brett
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
smells
very
nice
but
the
chalklike
flavor
i
am
getting
is
a
bit
odd
o
the
orange
addition
is
most
prevelant
in
the
nose
but
the
flavor
is
all
those
wonderfull
sour
brett
notes
an
easy
drinking
sour
with
some
great
characteristics
of
the
witbier
coming
through
this
is
the
first
100
brettanomyces
fermented
witbier
i
have
ever
had
being
100
brettanomyces
fermented
you
would
think
that
this
beer
would
be
overtly
funky
and
musty
but
that
isnt
the
case
here
while
there
is
a
strong
brettanomyces
funkiness
it
is
mostly
tropical
in
nature
the
one
fault
that
i
do
find
in
this
beer
is
the
use
of
blood
oranges
they
really
leave
an
unpleasant
unwavering
bitterness
not
unlike
if
you
were
chewing
on
the
rind
besides
the
use
of
this
seasonal
citrus
the
beer
definitely
is
a
winner
pastel
light
yellow
in
color
forms
a
smallish
creamy
white
head
but
what
does
form
is
quite
stable
and
long
lasting
no
lacing
aroma
is
brett
dominant
tart
lemon
dust
and
a
light
bit
of
funk
taste
is
similar
tart
lemon
but
not
sour
some
light
horse
blanket
and
a
slight
chalky
note
maybe
a
little
spice
but
its
faint
almost
like
an
old
lemonade
light
mouthfeel
lighter
carbonation
tart
a
very
nice
beer
but
surprisingly
restrained
brett
character
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
blood
orange
come
out
nicely
in
the
aroma
very
fresh
and
not
artificial
the
brett
gives
it
a
refreshing
tartness
wish
i
had
easy
access
to
this
stuff
its
hard
to
believe
i
would
think
any
sour
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
subtlety
but
this
one
could
really
benefit
its
very
tart
but
the
wrong
kind
of
sour
all
up
front
not
well
integrated
with
other
flavors
a
bit
harsh
and
bitter
like
a
pill
like
biting
into
the
walls
of
a
grapefruit
a
100
brett
wit
sounds
like
a
winner
in
my
opinion
but
perhaps
the
addition
of
the
citrus
didnt
work
so
well
an
intense
and
unique
beer
but
tough
to
drink
and
well
overpriced
im
really
hoping
that
i
got
a
bad
bottle
everyone
on
here
cant
be
wrong
about
this
this
beer
was
the
first
drainpour
i
have
ever
had
tasted
like
smoke
and
dirt
nothing
more
very
disappointing
i
would
love
to
try
it
again
because
like
i
said
i
must
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
has
this
happened
to
anyone
else
out
there
great
beer
simple
but
wonderfully
done
overall
an
excellent
beer
one
of
my
favorites
unfortunately
this
brewery
releases
very
small
batches
and
each
one
is
different
from
the
last
this
makes
each
one
interesting
and
dear
if
youre
looking
for
a
first
time
sour
this
is
a
good
choice
being
on
the
lighter
side
of
sour
it
probably
wont
win
any
awards
for
mouth
numbing
complexity
but
does
well
with
its
balance
and
funks
it
up
enough
to
be
interesting
something
id
drink
daily
if
i
could
get
it
overall
i
cant
wait
to
drink
my
other
one
and
hopefully
make
a
trip
out
to
denver
to
see
this
place
in
person
great
beer
sampled
with
a
good
friend
that
managed
to
get
several
from
this
brewery
the
aroma
hints
at
wit
but
the
flavor
goes
well
beyond
very
creative
the
brett
adds
both
funky
and
tart
aspects
making
this
a
rich
and
complex
beer
while
still
remaining
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
a
regular
supply
from
these
guys
o
this
was
more
of
a
saison
than
a
witbier
but
ill
take
it
the
beer
is
hazy
and
light
orange
with
a
small
white
head
the
aroma
is
nice
offering
citrus
brettanomyces
coriander
floral
hops
farmhouse
yeast
enticing
tart
and
sour
light
and
refreshing
citrus
and
brett
blend
beautifully
lingering
saison
yeast
and
tangy
citrus
a
delicious
beer
glad
to
have
more
of
this
one
o
refreshing
easy
drinking
yummy
funk
overall
crooked
stave
has
elevated
this
witbier
beyond
its
station
in
the
beer
world
impressive
o
very
impressive
the
brett
and
tart
citric
components
made
this
unlike
the
other
witbiers
ive
had
reminding
me
of
a
farmhouse
ale
more
than
anything
else
bottle
batch

2013
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
one
finger
white
fluffy
head
amazing
brett
aroma
with
definite
oranges
and
spice
flavor
is
big
and
bold
tart
lemon
with
an
orange
sweetness
on
the
back
end
that
lingers
with
the
tart
very
dry
lots
of
carbonation
light
body
this
is
an
incredible
summer
brew
which
i
hope
will
be
readily
available
next
year
here
in
florida
need
to
get
my
hands
on
the
other
seasons
now
o
a
great
beer
and
would
drink
this
more
often
and
would
recommend
to
friends
if
more
readily
available
i
will
defiantly
buy
this
when
ever
possible
crooked
stave
is
easily
one
of
my
new
fav
breweries
hail
brettanomyces
o
a
tart
yet
slightly
funky
witbier
from
crooked
stave
that
is
definitely
different
from
your
normal
witbier
with
its
tart
and
funky
presence
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
pretty
nice
and
damn
refreshing
overall
the
nose
is
a
lot
better
than
the
taste
unfortunately
but
it
still
gets
the
job
done
overall
as
good
as
this
beer
is
i
wish
i
liked
it
more
but
i
found
that
the
strong
flavors
clashed
a
bit
on
my
palate
overall
good
lots
of
citrus
lots
of
brett
a
very
odd
witbier
but
a
good
beer
o
this
is
my
first
brew
from
crooked
stave
and
it
did
not
disappoint
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
evening
would
reccomend
o
again
one
of
the
best
saisons
ive
enjoyed
to
date
so
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
in
every
component
true
to
style
t
opens
with
a
huge
dose
of
brett
some
bready
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
citrus
linger
behind
blood
orange
rind
underripe
green
grapes
and
bread
crust
all
in
there
finish
brings
some
lingering
oak
and
bretty
funk
liking
this
a
lot
and
i
definitely
hope
to
see
it
a
lot
more
o
this
was
a
great
saison
and
easily
better
then
the
majority
of
the
saisons
out
there
my
only
two
complaints
is
that
the
earthy
brett
dominated
the
citrus
taste
of
the
beer
a
little
bit
too
much
and
the
finish
was
a
little
bit
too
dry
both
very
minor
flaws
in
my
opinion
this
was
a
fantastic
saison
regardless
from
a
brewery
that
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
definitely
worth
checking
out
jd
poured
into
a
sante
adairius
tulip
getting
rustic
tonight
the
beer
is
an
orangey
golden
color
cloudy
medium
to
small
white
head
little
to
no
lacing
bubbles
burn
out
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
big
mix
of
wood
brett
fruitiness
and
funk
and
blood
orange
with
an
interestingly
musky
briny
background
maybe
more
blood
orange
contribution
blood
oranges
are
an
odd
fruit
for
me
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
normally
but
they
work
nicely
in
this
beer
theres
also
some
fresh
pale
malt
sweetness
the
taste
really
needs
some
time
to
warm
up
i
started
out
with
it
a
bit
too
cold
and
the
flavor
was
quite
muted
but
once
it
does
things
open
up
nice
wave
of
citrus
tartness
big
blood
orange
flavor
with
rind
and
juice
popping
up
it
starts
out
a
deep
vinous
and
blood
orangey
sweetness
with
some
fresh
doughy
grain
then
theres
an
explosion
of
complexity
as
layers
of
medium
tannic
oak
brett
fruitiness
dusty
farmhouse
funk
and
tartbitter
blood
oranges
line
up
in
harmony
soft
full
mouthfeel
nice
wheat
body
this
one
crept
up
on
me
when
it
was
too
cold
the
beer
seemed
all
washed
out
and
mild
more
and
more
flavor
came
out
as
the
glass
sat
theres
a
ton
of
excellent
brett
fruitiness
to
it
stone
fruit
berries
etc
tasty
beer
my
regard
for
crooked
stave
continues
to
rise
theres
a
lot
of
strategy
that
goes
into
an
ale
that
seems
so
haphazard
certain
sharpness
delicate
softness
and
a
cocoon
of
earthiness
layers
onto
the
palate
brilliantly
its
a
taste
thats
complex
enough
to
discuss
et
nauseum
or
to
drink
with
with
unabashed
thirst
quenching
relief
overall
pretty
good
and
easily
drinkable
not
my
favorite
sour
beer
of
the
sour
beers
ive
had
but
certainly
good
o
tart
citrus
with
a
nice
farmhouse
impact
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
retains
really
well
the
nose
is
musty
funky
mushrooms
with
faint
tanginess
from
the
blood
oranges
the
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
lemon
flavors
that
move
on
to
a
softer
brett
taste
funky
bready
cheddar
cheese
and
mushrooms
these
fade
to
a
slightly
sour
more
bitter
blood
orange
flavor
a
bit
of
bitter
hops
rounds
it
off
mouth
is
full
and
smooth
overall
thi
is
a
nice
barrel
aged
brett
beer
lots
of
subtle
flavors
thateldbtogether
to
form
a
complex
yet
not
overpowering
saison
good
stuff
nice
snappy
dryness
on
the
end
along
with
some
tartness
just
shy
of
bready
very
easy
drinking
taste
is
tart
citrus
with
loads
of
funk
the
blood
oranges
really
shine
in
the
finish
but
its
dominated
by
super
tart
lemony
flavor
dry
and
crisp
wow
this
is
just
amazing
hazy
pale
color
with
the
unfiltered
residue
sinking
to
the
bottom
it
has
a
quickly
receding
head
that
isnt
big
to
start
with
it
smells
like
wheat
with
a
touch
of
orange
at
the
end
but
isnt
very
strong
good
balance
of
citrus
and
wheat
with
a
little
spice
kick
at
the
end
nice
crisp
light
body
with
light
carbonation
overall
it
isnt
complicated
or
daring
and
follows
through
on
what
it
claims
to
be
a
solid
wheat
i
could
drink
in
any
weather
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
o
more
like
blue
moon
than
hoegaarden
or
allagash
would
not
purchase
again
but
might
be
ok
if
you
like
light
lagers
are
in
the
heat
or
mowing
the
lawn
feel
crisp
and
thin
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
a
little
more
carbonation

this
was
the
first
white
ale
and
it
was
really
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
good
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
light
and
clean
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
great
refreshing
beer
love
it
great
zesty
wheat
taste
great
beer
if
you
want
to
pound
a
couple
after
a
long
day
awfully
clear
for
a
witbier
orange
peel
lemon
coriander
wheat
and
floral
notes
form
the
aroma
flavor
is
zesty
with
orange
orange
pith
and
lemon
peel
underlying
a
light
wheat
backbone
theres
a
slight
sweetness
at
the
floral
finish
coriander
is
fairly
subtle
the
sweetness
at
the
finish
is
slightly
offputting
very
easy
to
drink
smooth
wheat
with
some
great
undertones
of
citrus
flavoring
just
not
too
outstanding
great
summer
brew
definitely
would
try
again
bought
one
as
a
sample
pack
at
grocery
store
cuz
i
am
interested
in
the
lost
coast
brewery
and
was
not
disappointed
overall
i
like
it
i
bet
this
is
amazing
on
draft
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
good
job
overall
nothing
offensive
or
outstanding
straw
yellow
in
apperance
with
a
decent
white
head
smells
really
nice
fruits
and
some
faint
malt
flavor
coming
through
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
light
and
refreshing
taste
is
pleasent
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
a
light
wheat
beer
with
some
faint
hits
of
citrus
refreshing
for
sure
but
not
too
complex
o
a
good
choice
for
a
keg
with
friends
coming
and
going
its
lightness
and
refreshing
qualities
make
it
very
approachable
not
able
to
stand
next
to
better
microhefes
and
certainly
not
topflight
german
hefes
in
terms
of
flavor
and
complexity
but
great
for
knocking
around
a
few
on
the
back
porch
o
its
not
a
bad
choice
at
all
for
a
summer
witbier
low
alcohol
and
drinkability
yes
i
went
there
means
you
could
kick
back
a
6pk
with
your
buddy
jesse
on
a
sloppy
summer
afternoon
pretty
seamlessly
the
feel
is
much
like
every
aspect
of
this
witbier
and
it
is
the
lightness
that
it
holds
the
scent
was
not
weak
just
light
the
flavor
the
same
and
the
feel
falls
right
in
line
its
unfortunate
that
the
beer
struggles
so
hard
for
those
true
belgianesque
flavors
and
textures
but
his
often
misunderstood
style
deserves
it
again
its
grain
harshness
muted
herbal
display
lack
of
milky
sourness
and
its
void
of
quality
vinous
tartness
really
limit
its
quality
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
properties
it
makes
for
a
nice
choice
on
a
hot
summer
day
summary
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
which
is
probably
the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
it
not
much
special
about
it
but
it
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
outstanding
unexpected
refreshing
rare
consistent
excellent
deep
light
complex
all
words
which
can
describe
this
beer
this
beer
was
hyped
up
to
me
as
allot
of
beers
have
been
i
thought
i
was
going
to
get
another
flavorless
lager
just
to
make
one
of
my
friends
happy
i
tried
it
i
was
wrong
very
very
good
beer
try
one
and
i
bet
you
will
order
it
again
has
something
for
everyone
in
there
good
decent
but
not
as
many
of
the
style
very
much
a
summer
session
beer
o
good
for
a
sessionable
summer
beer
but
not
much
more
then
that
oless
traditional
white
beer
is
really
good
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
bit
spicy
some
citrus
as
well
taste
is
very
refreshing
a
touch
of
sweetness
some
citrus
wheat
not
as
much
spices
as
the
smell
but
some
are
present
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
a
great
hot
summer
pool
beer
i
was
definately
surprised
with
the
amount
of
flavor
this
beer
had
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
bad
lost
coast
great
white
beer
45
at
the
price
that
this
is
locally
this
is
a
neatly
budgetpriced
option
for
bare
bones
white
ales
some
of
my
friends
in
particular
love
this
stuff
because
of
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
this
paired
decently
with
pork
topped
with
tomato
onions
and
lemon
squeezed
on
top
on
its
own
well
its
something
id
take
over
aals
at
parties
but
i
dont
know
if
thats
a
good
thing
or
not
for
better
or
for
worse
its
an
above
average
witbier
at
the
very
least
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
only
average
would
not
recommended
what
can
i
say
im
a
summer
beer
guy
and
this
one
doesnt
disapoint
great
label
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
evening
with
a
few
blonde
friends
one
of
my
summer
favorites
try
both
with
and
without
an
orangelemon
slice
anybody
who
rates
this
below
a
4
is
crazy
this
is
one
of
the
finest
beers
ever
crafted
the
only
reason
i
dont
score
it
a
5
is
because
its
a
witbeir
and
im
not
particularly
fond
of
them
but
this
great
white
i
could
drink
all
night
serve
it
with
an
orange
slice
i
liked
this
one
it
pours
a
sort
of
average
looking
clear
yellow
to
golden
color
with
basically
no
head
just
a
few
patches
of
leftover
white
bubbles
the
nose
is
nice
though
fruity
and
robust
glistening
yeast
and
something
tropical
thats
tough
to
place
the
flavor
is
very
balanced
between
the
light
wheat
malt
heavily
filtered
and
refined
the
fruity
yeast
somewhere
between
a
hefe
and
a
belgian
and
the
hops
which
are
english
in
the
bittering
sense
but
american
and
the
dripping
juicy
sense
this
is
a
very
tasty
brew
a
little
too
thin
on
the
body
i
need
more
heft
in
my
wheat
beers
but
just
right
on
the
carbonation
which
is
lively
but
not
popping
off
too
hard
overall
id
rather
have
a
tangerine
wheat
but
this
was
a
useful
pint
of
beer
worth
the
four
bucks
i
paid
for
it
and
one
ill
drink
again
before
too
long
it
came
out
it
had
a
golden
color
body
with
no
head
the
aroma
was
of
citrus
and
with
some
grassy
malty
notes
to
it
the
taste
had
some
nice
lemon
notes
and
wheat
to
it
also
some
fruit
and
citrus
also
the
mouthfeel
is
was
very
good
good
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
o
average
at
best
pours
golden
to
straw
with
a
hint
of
haze
and
weak
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
candy
apples
malt
sweetness
and
a
dash
of
lemon
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
malt
sweetness
mixed
with
candied
apples
and
lemon
but
now
a
nice
floral
hop
flavor
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
intertwine
with
the
other
notes
creating
a
pleasing
array
of
flavors
overall
a
decent
wheat
beer
a
lot
like
a
fruity
pale
ale
great
white
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
size
head
that
did
disapate
quickly
there
were
nice
lemon
aromas
with
bits
of
wheat
aromas
as
well
nice
lemon
flavors
but
a
weak
wheat
flavor
also
some
yeast
flavors
mixed
in
the
flavor
was
a
bit
weak
and
watery
overall
it
was
a
nice
witbier
a
bit
watery
but
still
good
and
was
very
refreshing
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
pours
a
hazy
hay
color
with
a
lot
of
head
smells
of
floral
sweet
malts
and
a
bit
of
spicy
citrus
taste
is
of
sweet
but
sour
citrusy
wheaty
malts
some
clove
and
banana
but
otherwise
too
sweet
and
lemony
its
easy
to
drink
but
rather
blah
there
are
better
offerings
usually
around
although
it
is
diff
than
most
ive
had
of
the
style
just
not
overly
pleasing
o
overall
nothing
exciting
about
this
beer
pretty
boring
and
tame
i
happen
to
like
the
mouthfeel
even
if
its
off
style
since
it
makes
it
great
for
summer
its
way
lighter
than
a
true
belgian
wit
but
its
not
nearly
as
sweet
so
they
balance
each
other
out
im
ambivalent
about
this
beer
and
its
lack
of
complexity
but
the
good
outweighs
the
bad
overall
when
i
first
looked
at
the
label
i
was
expecting
a
wheat
beer
but
i
think
i
was
also
expecting
maybe
more
to
pack
a
punch
considering
that
i
was
totally
looking
forward
to
more
then
what
i
got
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
that
blew
me
away
just
too
average
i
guess
i
cannot
get
this
in
kansas
city
if
i
could
it
would
be
a
summer
time
staple
overall
its
been
a
while
since
ive
drank
a
witbier
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
barely
more
flavor
than
coors
light
give
it
a
pass
o
this
was
just
an
average
witbier
nothing
special
here
definitely
had
better
but
certainly
not
bad
pours
a
clear
light
amber
with
a
little
yeast
in
suspension
one
finger
fizzy
white
head
is
gone
quickly
smell
lightly
fruity
lemony
coriander
taste
wheat
twang
coriander
herbal
notes
crisp
carbonation
into
a
slick
finish
overattenuated
boring
no
thanks
im
a
fan
overall
and
would
recommend
it
for
some
casual
drinking
buds
looks
like
a
lager
smells
and
tastes
like
a
wheat
beer
and
called
great
white
for
a
killer
craft
brew
to
try
not
super
special
but
its
a
craft
beer
so
its
special
single
finger
head
with
lots
lacing
on
a
cloudy
murky
body
musty
hop
and
malt
aroma
with
light
lemon
note
light
to
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
musty
and
malty
flavor
a
little
plain
with
a
light
lemon
note
overall
very
drinkable
but
simple
overall
the
black
tea
was
interesting
in
the
front
of
my
tongue
reminded
me
of
earl
gray
teamy
favorite
little
wheat
driven
and
more
richness
then
expected
overall
light
but
a
unique
and
a
distinct
beer
its
certainly
an
american
twist
on
the
classic
witbier
session
friendly
overall
this
is
a
decent
witbier
even
if
it
doesnt
really
look
like
one
id
have
it
again
but
as
their
bestseller
i
can
see
why
its
probably
going
to
agree
with
everyone
who
drinks
it
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
2
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
chunky
island
of
foam
small
streaks
of
lace
form
randomly
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
perfume
fruit
and
spices
there
is
a
hint
of
grain
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
of
grain
perfume
and
spices
there
is
a
slightly
fruity
aftertaste
as
well
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
and
not
something
i
would
revisit
again
mediumish
body
with
an
appropriate
effervescence
for
the
style
sharp
up
front
but
fading
fast
slightly
drying
in
the
finish
this
could
easily
be
labeled
a
wheat
and
is
easily
confused
with
one
good
but
nothing
more
o
i
like
witbiers
and
this
just
didnt
impress
me
instead
of
taking
time
on
art
design
with
their
sharky
they
should
work
on
balancing
their
beers
better
o
wont
be
drinking
this
beer
again
not
bad
but
it
is
nothing
worth
looking
for
3
overall
the
beer
is
really
quite
pleasant
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
but
i
couldnt
see
seeking
it
out
good
refreshing
nonetheless
i
like
it
but
would
go
with
hoegaarden
over
it
if
that
puts
it
in
perspective
o
great
intro
beer
oan
average
wit
without
much
character
oa
typical
wheat
beer
not
much
that
stands
out
no
real
reason
to
buy
this
again
the
great
white
beer
from
lost
coast
is
ok
the
beer
poured
a
pale
straw
clear
color
with
vitually
no
head
and
no
lacing
there
is
not
much
to
the
smell
slight
faint
citrus
and
spice
the
taste
is
crisp
tangerine
and
spice
flare
with
some
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
the
beer
is
ok
probably
best
for
summer
days
o
definitely
wont
buy
this
again
price
wise
there
is
no
reason
why
this
beer
should
cost
what
it
does
feel
like
the
quality
is
just
not
there
nice
poor
very
light
head
this
beer
is
unfiltered
but
not
cloudy
it
has
a
plesent
light
malt
and
fruity
smell
very
smooth
and
refreshing
i
taste
wonderful
spring
water
light
spices
and
citrus
i
would
personally
highly
recommend
this
beer
if
you
like
even
more
fruit
flavor
then
try
the
tangerine
beer
by
lost
coast
my
wife
likes
that
one
overall
this
is
ok
better
than
macro
swill
but
friends
are
telling
me
my
homebrewed
wheat
beer
is
more
complex
and
enjoyable
o
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
out
of
this
however
it
doesnt
have
much
complexity
there
was
a
slightly
unpleasant
after
taste
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
definitely
not
bad
just
not
the
best
o
like
i
said
its
not
a
complex
beer
at
all
but
it
does
a
great
job
of
refreshing
you
it
would
be
great
to
drink
on
a
patio
or
at
the
beach
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
like
what
lost
coast
is
doing
and
how
their
beers
stand
out
but
its
tricky
to
review
them
definitely
would
be
a
great
beer
for
summer
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
hazy
looking
orange
color
the
head
was
white
and
fluffy
leaving
a
pretty
nice
lacing
behind
the
smell
of
this
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
citrus
and
some
floral
spices
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
refreshing
floral
and
citrusy
the
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
and
smooth
it
had
a
good
carbonation
to
it
also
overall
i
found
this
brew
to
be
pretty
tasty
surely
an
enjoyable
beer
the
mouthfeel
of
great
white
is
rather
light
so
if
you
are
hoping
for
a
really
strong
beer
i
would
suggest
you
look
elsewhere
for
those
who
like
wheat
beers
and
know
what
is
good
when
it
comes
to
the
style
then
this
mouthfeel
will
not
disappoint
this
offering
is
light
and
crisp
and
really
is
a
good
beer
that
will
both
satisfy
and
refresh
on
those
hot
summer
days
the
low
abv
and
the
nature
of
the
beer
allows
the
drinkability
of
this
beet
to
be
quite
high
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
somewhat
intriguing
although
not
terribly
complex
still
good
to
taste
though
kind
of
like
what
youd
get
when
mixing
a
bud
lite
with
a
glass
of
lemonade
well
actually
not
at
all
but
you
get
the
point
a
nonsweet
lemon
drink
has
its
refreshing
qualities
but
would
not
pursue
overall
ill
finish
the
6
pack
i
have
gladly
but
i
wouldnt
jump
to
get
more
of
this
theres
much
better
beers
that
exemplify
the
style
a
middle
of
the
road
attempt
at
a
witbier
lacking
depth
and
yeast
character
overall
a
very
drinkable
california
version
of
a
witbier
at
least
thats
my
take
to
me
it
really
tastes
like
a
light
version
of
franziskaner
the
same
types
of
spices
are
there
but
ya
just
cant
fully
taste
them
sessionable
for
sure
trader
joes
is
helping
me
open
my
eyes
to
random
new
beers
at
considerably
low
prices
they
should
pay
me
for
all
the
shilling
ive
been
doing
for
them
lately
this
caseinpoint
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
and
populated
by
a
bunch
o
little
floaties
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
orange
zest
light
grapefruit
zest
this
is
one
zesty
beer
eh
coriander
confectioners
sugar
a
twist
of
lime
and
a
few
drops
of
honey
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
zest
coriander
light
black
pepper
very
light
lime
light
grapefruit
a
touch
of
banana
and
a
honeydew
slice
or
two
nice
and
fruity
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
meekly
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
nice
wit
something
im
kinda
glad
ive
found
at
tjs
an
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
sure
but
the
other
witbier
qualities
seem
to
be
forgotten
on
the
side
of
some
nocal
highway
pale
yellow
with
a
strong
white
head
that
does
not
lace
i
was
expecting
more
haze
in
the
body
than
there
was
though
nose
is
dominated
by
citrus
specifically
lemon
rind
and
is
otherwise
one
dimensional
citrus
is
also
in
the
body
though
tealike
notes
become
more
prevelant
over
time
carbonation
is
low
now
for
the
truly
damning
statement
i
would
rather
have
had
a
hoegaarden
wit
is
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
though
as
i
remember
great
white
was
one
of
my
first
craft
beers
and
certainly
my
first
wheat
beer
i
like
it
im
not
likely
to
buy
it
again
soon
and
it
isnt
a
very
hearty
wit
pours
a
light
yellow
with
little
head
nose
is
citrus
and
mild
spice
taste
is
not
what
i
expected
lemon
and
straw
but
theres
something
off
about
it
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
dry
not
disappointed
i
tried
it
while
in
ca
but
not
impressed
notes
dissapointed
with
this
one
after
my
positive
experience
with
lost
coast
indica
on
tap
at
the
store
earlier
i
guess
you
win
some
and
you
lose
some
this
beer
is
not
good
a
citrusy
witbier
lacking
spices
character
and
definition
an
extremely
simple
and
average
witbier
move
over
jaws
there
is
a
new
shark
in
town
great
white
is
the
perfect
summer
bbq
beer
the
pale
golden
color
and
amazing
taste
made
me
an
instant
fan
after
my
first
one
it
has
a
nice
citrus
smell
with
a
hint
of
what
i
think
is
vanilla
and
it
goes
down
smooth
go
out
grab
some
and
have
a
bbq
with
your
friendsyou
wont
regret
it
there
are
very
few
beers
i
wont
finish
but
this
is
one
i
couldnt
get
away
from
the
feeling
i
was
drinking
air
freshener
blech
d
blah
the
spices
come
off
as
flat
and
the
malt
is
too
sweet
for
it
to
be
really
drinkable
a
little
bit
of
tartness
would
go
a
long
way
towards
balancing
things
out
as
it
does
in
the
few
good
examples
of
the
style
but
this
beer
is
completely
lacking
in
such
acidity
and
it
shows
in
the
flabby
finish
not
terrible
for
what
it
is
but
like
most
witbiers
it
is
not
something
that
i
would
drink
again
final
thought
at
7
this
wont
hurt
your
pocket
and
will
impress
the
ladies
notes
great
summer
beer
thats
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
good
quality
but
not
complex
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
after
a
few
minutes
left
very
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
gives
of
a
sweet
grain
and
fruity
tones
flavor
is
sweet
with
hints
of
lemon
and
a
bit
of
spice
has
a
medium
body
and
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
and
has
a
smooth
finish
a
good
beer
with
many
different
flavors
lemony
and
spice
overall
decent
enough
and
easy
to
drink
but
this
is
really
a
wit
made
for
the
witless
way
too
sweet
and
not
nearly
spicy
enough
overall
a
nice
above
average
white
beer
i
found
it
had
a
more
potent
flavour
on
tap
than
it
did
in
the
bottle
this
is
a
good
beer
any
day
but
is
even
better
on
a
hot
one
before
becoming
more
familiar
with
beer
and
developing
a
pallet
this
beer
was
enjoyable
and
refreshing
however
that
has
all
changed
there
is
too
much
tangerine
and
spices
added
the
beer
giving
it
a
poor
aftertaste
color
is
a
bit
cloudy
all
these
aspects
make
this
beer
sub
par
overall
an
alright
beer
but
not
one
i
would
actively
choose
overall
a
very
well
made
beer
and
an
interesting
experience
but
with
all
of
the
crazy
spices
you
can
put
in
wit
beer
this
may
not
be
my
favorite
example
o
a
mix
of
sour
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
witbier
and
not
successful
overall
simply
not
a
good
witbier
ive
only
tried
this
beer
on
tap
yet
every
time
i
have
yet
i
like
it
more
and
more
head
wasnt
that
big
with
very
slight
lace
the
nose
was
very
pleasing
with
slight
citrus
hints
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
honey
on
the
palate
is
very
refreshing
well
carbonated
i
could
taste
citrus
with
slight
hints
of
sweetness
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
to
someone
who
had
never
tried
it
i
will
try
it
in
a
bottle
next
time
d
this
is
very
easy
to
plow
thru
alot
of
these
but
just
not
alot
of
taste
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
this
one
d
a
beer
has
to
be
truly
stellar
to
stand
out
in
this
crowded
category
i
found
this
one
to
be
good
but
average
overall
just
an
average
wheat
beer
for
me
this
was
a
one
6pack
that
was
for
the
time
and
perfect
for
the
summerearly
fall
in
hi
beach
beer
poured
aggressively
for
a
1finger
head
reduces
to
nothing
runny
lacing
color
is
slightlycloudy
corn
yellow
aroma
of
slight
lemon
peel
and
very
light
malt
taste
is
the
same
very
simple
session
witbier
this
was
the
only
craft
beer
at
the
corner
store
in
northern
california
that
i
hadnt
tried
so
may
as
well
give
it
a
go
pours
a
goldenyellow
colour
with
fizzy
white
head
without
any
lacing
smells
strongly
of
lemon
with
some
of
the
wheat
malt
there
is
a
lot
of
sweetness
but
still
some
tart
lemon
flavour
medium
bodied
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
too
heavy
on
the
citrus
and
too
low
on
the
beer
flavour
i
guess
ive
had
better
domestic
wit
style
beers
but
this
isnt
bad
at
all
have
to
say
im
a
bit
surprised
by
the
low
scores
as
i
thought
this
a
pretty
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
of
course
having
it
fresh
right
at
the
source
probably
doesnt
hurt
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
a
bit
of
yellowgold
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
and
little
lace
the
nose
is
a
bit
of
citrus
wheat
and
light
spicing
the
taste
is
a
bit
bland
with
some
pale
wheat
and
very
mild
citrus
body
is
nice
with
good
carbonation
makes
up
for
some
of
the
flavors
decent
beer
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
very
toned
down
flavors
in
this
one
almost
no
spice
to
speak
of
it
was
hard
to
pick
out
anything
in
the
nose
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
though
very
refreshing
great
white
is
a
great
beer
if
youre
not
much
of
a
beer
drinker
but
if
you
are
an
advanced
beer
drinker
this
will
seem
rather
weak
and
basic
it
pours
a
lighter
yellow
color
and
is
very
easy
drinking
it
has
a
decent
mellow
flavor
but
no
voloume
in
its
taste
comparison
wise
its
around
the
same
grade
of
beer
as
miller
lite
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
just
not
a
good
beer
drinkability
quite
drinkable
value
lost
coast
beers
are
an
excellent
value
this
one
is
no
exception
not
bad
at
all
paid
1
59
for
a
single
id
take
this
over
blue
moon
any
day
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
drinks
really
easy
liked
this
much
better
than
a
previous
time
when
i
had
this
on
draft
years
ago
served
too
cold
imo
nice
if
simple
take
on
the
style
d
pretty
drinkable
would
lbe
a
lot
more
so
if
it
wasnt
disgustingly
sweet
d
this
is
my
beer
to
drink
when
i
just
want
a
beer
really
enjoy
the
flavor
that
comes
from
a
great
white
note
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
white
beer
and
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
little
disappointed
overall
i
like
it
good
beer
for
a
hot
florida
day
d
with
the
light
subtle
flavors
this
is
a
easy
going
brew
but
the
overall
drinkability
give
off
a
fast
drinking
beer
not
many
complex
flavors
bur
just
enough
to
go
back
to
search
for
them
im
going
to
forgo
the
usual
format
for
reviewing
beers
because
this
is
going
to
be
brief
and
tothepoint
this
beer
is
just
plain
underwhelming
as
i
poured
it
into
my
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
nice
faint
orange
haze
and
lively
carbonation
was
a
promising
start
little
did
i
know
just
how
quickly
things
would
turn
very
thin
watery
malts
barely
surface
coriander
and
some
secret
blend
of
herbs
not
detectable
on
the
nose
or
palate
lost
coast
categorizes
this
to
be
a
wheat
beer
but
it
goes
down
like
a
summer
ale
gone
horribly
wrong
the
1
5
mark
for
drinkability
isnt
an
exaggeration
i
cant
remember
the
last
time
that
i
refused
to
finish
off
a
sixer
of
anything
that
i
purchased
until
great
white
swirl
poured
into
a
beaker
one
finger
white
head
on
a
slightly
hazy
dark
lemon
very
transparent
for
a
wit
citrus
and
bread
smells
a
bit
weak
in
the
taste
department
but
defiantly
a
spicier
rather
than
a
fruitier
wit
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
rounded
pretty
drinkable
although
its
weakness
might
be
a
bit
boring
after
a
while
d
wow
extremely
quaffable
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
witbier
id
forgotten
just
how
refreshing
they
are
this
one
has
a
good
amount
of
flavor
i
think
id
buy
this
one
again
sometime
cheers
a
decent
witbier
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
beers
pretty
average
and
not
worth
looking
for
d
meh
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
sessionable
but
a
little
boring
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
no
noticeable
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
you
might
pick
up
faint
lemon
coriander
aspects
of
it
but
barely
and
you
might
be
searching
to
find
even
that
no
hops
no
aftertaste
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
a
perfect
session
beer
great
flavor
and
light
body
appealing
to
the
senses
id
highly
recommend
this
to
others
especially
as
a
summer
time
beer
if
anything
the
beer
is
too
light
after
a
six
pack
youre
left
craving
more
drinkability
witbier
light
totally
unimpressive
its
not
bad
and
a
little
fun
but
not
high
quality
or
very
complex
d
a
decent
session
beer
i
could
easily
drink
too
many
although
while
it
is
a
great
beer
it
doesnt
really
fit
in
the
style
of
a
witbier
very
average
but
very
easy
drinking
d
i
liked
this
ok
it
was
refreshing
as
a
lawnmower
beer
to
me
and
i
would
not
turn
one
down
but
i
have
had
many
better
tasting
wits
with
fuller
flavor
it
just
felt
middle
of
the
road
overall
id
definitely
do
this
one
again
i
was
pretty
impressed
overall
and
found
it
quite
tasty
and
fairly
drinkable
which
im
learning
is
routinely
the
case
for
lost
coast
offerings
i
have
to
say
this
is
not
the
best
whear
wit
ive
had
the
flavor
is
good
which
really
makes
up
for
the
rest
of
the
inadequacy
d
fairly
drinkable
but
needs
more
taste
to
compare
to
others
in
the
style
ontap
at
tops
tasting
room
tempe
light
watered
down
wheat
an
uninteresting
wheat
looks
ok
with
decent
white
head
smells
ok
but
not
so
drinkable
some
lemon
juice
and
corriander
and
the
whole
thing
is
not
so
tasty
just
doesnt
get
me
an
entry
level
wheat
not
very
appealing
though
it
is
different
than
any
other
witbier
youll
find
originality
doesnt
always
lead
to
a
desirable
product
unfortunately
and
its
far
too
uneven
with
all
the
added
spices
drinkability
nice
beer
but
doesnt
quite
fit
the
style
i
recall
a
version
of
great
white
that
was
obviously
unfiltered
delivered
more
taste
than
just
the
overpowering
sweetness
of
this
brew
and
had
a
more
substantial
texture
consistent
with
its
appearance
i
first
detected
the
transition
from
old
sharky
as
i
like
to
think
of
it
to
this
current
beer
in
the
summer
of
2008
during
a
visit
to
the
lost
coast
pub
in
eureka
since
then
i
have
had
it
many
times
out
of
the
bottle
and
once
or
twice
on
draft
with
the
same
conclusion
i
would
be
interested
to
hear
if
other
longtime
drinkers
of
this
beer
observed
anything
like
the
change
i
describe
d
abv
wise
this
is
highly
drinkable
the
coriander
was
too
overpowering
for
me
which
makes
this
a
beer
that
i
would
pass
on
in
the
future
drinkability
very
nice
and
mellow
that
is
both
refreshing
and
not
overpowering
perfect
for
hotter
climates
i
could
certainly
drink
a
few
of
these
at
any
get
together
under
the
sun
great
white
beer
is
worth
a
look
and
dont
worry
its
safe
to
go
in
d
an
ok
beer
that
is
most
likely
better
suited
for
warm
summer
days
i
would
defiantly
drink
one
if
offered
however
this
is
overshadowed
by
many
similar
beers
and
due
to
this
i
would
not
buy
another
drinkability
pretty
good
great
summer
beer
perfect
for
when
you
are
working
when
i
think
great
white
the
first
thing
i
think
of
is
citrus
its
probably
the
first
beer
i
tried
long
ago
that
was
brewed
with
any
kind
of
citrus
ingredients
its
aroma
is
mild
and
appearance
is
light
it
has
little
to
no
head
on
the
tongue
it
is
light
but
creamy
with
mild
hints
of
that
famous
citrus
that
get
more
and
more
prominent
the
more
you
drink
although
all
in
all
its
a
light
flavoring
that
adds
a
touch
of
individuality
to
an
already
descent
ale
a
real
good
beer
to
drink
if
your
outside
in
the
sun
at
the
beach
or
river
bar
coming
out
of
the
ice
chest
a
few
degrees
cooler
than
the
fridge
sample
at
alans
hsc
initation
bottle
from
howards
market
in
tehachapi
ca
this
brew
is
a
clear
yellowgold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
spots
of
lacing
odd
aroma
of
malt
and
vegetables
at
first
but
it
dissipates
into
a
mild
spice
pretty
fast
lightbodied
with
a
flavor
akin
to
a
pale
lager
light
hops
and
spice
flavor
with
a
bit
of
citrus
the
finish
is
mildly
spiced
with
a
short
citrus
aftertaste
barely
average
overall
drinkability
a
decent
beer
that
i
wouldnt
want
too
many
of
there
are
just
so
many
great
beers
out
there
to
conquer
this
one
i
would
give
this
a
better
drinkability
review
do
to
the
fact
that
i
cant
ever
just
have
one
of
these
working
in
my
garage
i
found
myself
drinking
alot
more
of
them
then
i
should
great
white
goes
awesome
with
spicy
foods
i
believe
great
white
is
the
pringles
of
beers
once
you
pop
you
cant
stop
great
beer
d
i
dont
think
i
would
make
this
a
regular
session
beer
just
because
its
probably
a
bit
too
sweet
for
that
but
its
still
something
i
will
come
back
to
every
now
and
then
its
a
pretty
decent
summer
option
which
tastes
pretty
good
even
as
it
warms
if
slightly
bland
a
great
unassuming
wit
nice
twist
in
the
flavour
profile
from
the
norm
a
decent
quencher
that
would
make
an
excellent
sessional
im
grateful
for
the
one
i
was
given
and
will
have
to
pick
up
some
more
notes
ok
mouthfeel
but
nothing
really
stood
out
for
this
witbier
drinkability
an
okay
beer
for
a
session
although
a
touch
bland
i
imagine
a
beer
like
this
gets
lost
in
the
shuffle
amidst
the
great
beers
of
ca
crisp
obviously
citrus
notes
hit
you
first
when
you
smell
that
disappearing
foam
head
i
quickly
questioned
the
serving
temp
i
dropped
the
fridge
to
a
chilly
34
degrees
much
better
served
cold
i
chopped
up
a
fresh
orange
and
placed
slices
in
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glasses
i
had
many
complements
on
this
move
i
vote
serve
this
beer
cold
and
drink
them
fast
face
it
some
summer
wheats
can
be
disappointing
this
one
is
not
cheers
drinkability
very
drinkable
good
session
wit
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
draft
not
a
great
beet
but
an
easy
to
drink
beer
tucson
summers
are
miserably
dehydrating
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
wont
leave
a
dry
feeling
in
your
mouth
that
an
ipa
or
pale
ale
will
this
time
or
year
the
appearance
is
slightly
cloudy
showing
it
hasnt
been
filtered
to
death
and
the
aroma
that
of
any
good
wheat
beer
i
find
myself
enjoying
a
lot
of
this
lately
1x
the
body
is
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
the
drinkability
on
this
excellent
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
goto
summer
beers
and
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
heavier
beers
of
winter
i
suggest
drinking
this
at
the
beach
drinkability
this
is
good
stuff
the
best
wit
i
have
ever
had
i
couldnt
think
of
anything
better
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
had
this
side
by
side
with
another
witbeir
this
one
was
the
least
complex
and
teast
remarkable
of
the
two
drinkability
i
dont
hate
it
like
i
used
to
when
i
went
to
humboldt
state
and
every
college
kid
was
drinking
12
packs
out
of
the
bottle
its
better
than
i
remember
but
still
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
witbier
it
drinks
easy
but
thats
because
theres
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
and
not
much
alcohol
in
it
not
offensive
but
not
noteworthy
either
pours
slight
hazy
yellow
with
white
head
nose
is
atypical
for
witbier
style
very
tepid
with
faint
citrus
and
somewhat
yeasty
no
lemon
orangecoriander
or
anything
distinctively
witbier
palate
comes
across
as
an
ordinary
wheat
ale
as
well
nothing
distinctive
to
the
style
libation
do
yourself
a
favor
and
skip
this
pour
for
something
you
wont
regret
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
shaker
glass
appears
a
hazy
bright
yellow
color
with
an
inch
of
creamy
bone
white
foam
smells
and
tastes
of
light
citrus
such
as
orange
and
lemon
wheat
bread
spicy
yeast
and
a
mild
hint
of
black
pepper
a
bit
thin
bodied
but
not
too
drastic
with
ample
carbonation
worth
a
try
refreshingly
carbonated
i
could
easily
chug
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
day
and
not
even
know
it
all
and
all
a
pretty
solid
witbier
if
you
ask
me
a
light
golden
hue
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
small
head
and
no
lacing
a
zesty
peppery
smell
with
minor
notes
of
clove
lemon
and
wheat
a
thinbodied
beer
that
bordered
on
being
a
tad
sour
as
the
citric
notes
lemonorange
are
sharp
and
cutting
and
there
is
very
little
of
the
spices
on
the
back
to
balance
or
wheat
to
offer
some
fluffsweetness
an
alright
wit
but
i
dont
see
myself
drinking
a
sixer
of
this
anytime
hmm
finishing
the
glass
was
a
task
any
more
would
be
unpleasant
not
sure
this
one
really
falls
into
the
white
beer
category
more
like
a
pasty
ghostly
pale
with
some
citrus
not
my
cup
of
tea
just
average
on
the
whole
and
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
one
8
ball
is
one
of
my
favorite
stouts
but
i
just
cant
say
much
positive
about
this
one
d
nothing
to
speak
of
went
fine
with
my
quesadilla
but
probably
wouldnt
have
it
as
a
stand
alone
drinkability
for
all
its
faults
its
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
with
that
said
would
i
really
want
another
hmmmm
probably
not
was
gonna
give
it
a
3
0
but
ill
bump
it
up
to
3
5
for
old
times
sake
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
fluffy
white
head
and
good
clumpy
lacing
the
aroma
is
clean
rice
cereal
a
little
skunky
with
a
suggestion
of
citrus
the
taste
is
crisp
tingly
lemon
wheat
kind
of
whimpy
watery
tart
pumpernickel
bitterness
sharp
and
thin
not
my
favorite
combination
but
a
drinkable
refreshment
in
a
pinch
drinkability
honestly
i
couldnt
find
anything
remarkable
or
special
about
this
beer
i
am
sure
some
people
really
enjoy
it
may
even
be
their
favorite
but
its
just
not
for
me
sorry
this
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
with
nice
white
head
that
did
not
last
aroma
was
of
citrus
fruits
spice
and
wheat
the
taste
is
of
the
same
with
the
citrus
dominating
the
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
drinkability
would
be
high
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
not
great
but
damn
it
is
refreshing
golden
light
blonde
color
with
some
nice
white
head
on
the
top
very
aromatic
indeed
citrus
in
full
bloom
a
refreshing
taste
that
is
light
on
the
palate
and
very
smooth
coming
and
going
great
beer
to
compliment
with
some
salmon
and
arugula
salad
a
summertime
session
beer
without
contest
recommended
overall
an
average
session
beer
and
an
odd
halfbaked
attempt
at
a
wit
overall
i
agree
with
others
that
this
isnt
quite
a
wit
that
being
said
its
still
a
solid
beer
that
i
could
drink
a
few
of
in
warmer
months
worth
a
shot
rated
apr
30
2007
from
a
22
oz
bottle
purchased
locally
aroma
is
yeasty
grainy
and
a
little
spicy
color
is
a
beautiful
straw
yellow
clear
with
a
small
white
head
flavor
is
grainy
with
some
fruit
fairly
restrained
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
easy
drinking
and
not
over
carbonated
drinkability
not
as
refreshing
as
others
in
the
style
flavor
profile
is
very
mild
and
not
overly
exciting
d
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
above
average
on
the
whole
but
id
rather
grab
a
hoegaarden
the
body
is
somewhat
thin
and
dry
lacking
in
richness
and
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
orange
peel
some
spice
and
not
much
more
it
is
far
from
inspiring
and
i
will
probably
stay
away
from
this
one
unless
i
have
to
or
someone
hands
me
a
bottle
turning
down
a
beer
is
always
alcohol
abuse
in
my
book
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
the
taste
is
clean
with
wheat
dominating
most
of
the
way
through
with
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
coriander
and
lemony
taste
linger
in
the
mouth
overall
not
a
bad
one
but
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
for
almost
9
00sixpack
ill
spend
my
money
elsewhere
thanks
to
mark
for
letting
me
try
this
one
the
taste
is
mostly
just
orange
zest
and
orange
cleaning
chemicals
it
has
a
hint
of
spices
and
herbs
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
grain
its
sweet
up
front
followed
by
a
mild
lingering
chemically
perfumy
orangecleaner
bitterness
thats
sticky
and
lingering
its
reasonably
easy
to
drink
at
least
at
first
but
the
orange
element
is
very
tiresome
this
is
a
pretty
nice
wit
in
effect
its
a
pretty
timid
copy
of
the
better
belgian
varieties
or
some
of
the
excellent
american
examples
but
its
genuinely
a
wit
at
least
very
drinkable
refreshing
enjoyable
despite
all
that
on
a
hot
summer
day
say
whitefish
montana
i
could
pound
these
all
day
long
given
the
lower
abv
and
the
ease
that
they
go
down
in
that
sense
this
is
a
decent
wit
appearance
is
slightly
cloudy
but
brilliant
yellow
with
a
lively
offwhite
head
aroma
is
full
of
fruity
esters
like
orange
lemon
peach
mango
and
then
some
bread
dough
like
yeastiness
and
finally
some
fresh
herbs
like
basil
very
complex
taste
mmm
kind
of
like
a
summer
meadow
in
a
glass
fruits
flowers
herbs
and
yes
some
maltiness
too
just
enough
hop
bitterness
to
balance
any
sweetness
despite
all
the
esters
its
not
a
very
sweet
beer
and
actually
finishes
semidry
for
a
very
thirst
quenching
pint
ive
had
this
now
from
the
bottle
and
on
tap
at
their
little
brewpub
its
outrageously
delicious
on
tap
and
the
brewpub
has
the
best
grub
in
town
a
bit
more
subdued
in
the
bottle
but
definately
worth
seeking
out
poured
a
orangepeachish
mix
to
me
sudded
and
looked
like
a
hefe
it
was
really
good
on
the
nose
but
the
taste
was
not
for
me
not
to
say
it
was
a
bad
beer
the
citrous
was
there
but
it
leaned
toward
a
wheat
citrousy
side
on
the
taste
the
nose
lead
me
to
believe
the
taste
was
better
than
it
was
drinkable
light
bodied
i
could
probably
drink
50
of
these
but
i
think
ill
just
move
on
instead
after
killing
all
these
of
course
smell
is
somewhat
subdued
but
taste
has
a
nice
slightly
tart
taste
with
notes
of
herb
and
spice
nice
bubbly
mouth
feel
finishes
nicely
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
would
have
another
one
for
sure
overall
not
a
horrible
beer
a
good
beer
for
summer
as
it
was
refreshing
and
crisp
nothing
to
impressive
though
mouthfeel
isnt
too
good
either
almost
tastes
flat
d
a
decent
wit
there
are
definitely
others
with
less
of
a
muted
flavor
but
this
is
pretty
good
a
nice
summer
brew
d
easy
to
drink
refreshing
though
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
there
are
other
witbeirs
i
would
probably
rather
buy
would
rate
this
just
very
average
surprisingly
full
mouthfeel
not
full
compared
to
other
styles
but
for
a
witbier
its
damn
good
d
nothing
objectionable
but
not
really
worth
much
of
a
look
easy
drinking
but
not
much
else
going
on
not
really
a
witbier
in
my
opinion
not
bad
if
there
was
a
light
witbier
category
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
nice
refreshing
lighter
beer
that
i
could
pound
down
for
a
long
time
not
terribly
exciting
to
drink
but
theoretically
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
i
drank
this
beer
only
because
it
was
one
of
my
friends
favorites
im
a
stronger
beer
fan
myself
not
that
bad
and
its
a
local
beer
im
from
humboldt
county
tastes
very
much
citrus
but
not
super
strong
a
good
beer
if
your
thirsty
and
dont
want
to
get
full
or
drunk
pours
a
cloudy
yellowish
white
with
a
decent
white
head
the
smell
is
of
biscuity
malt
with
grains
and
a
hint
of
spice
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
biscuity
malt
grain
and
unfortunately
only
a
hint
of
spice
a
decent
warm
weather
thirst
quencher
light
cloudy
yellow
golden
color
with
a
fruity
wheat
smell
nice
sweet
wheat
like
spice
a
good
all
around
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
that
kind
of
like
a
cross
of
a
kolsch
wit
beer
completely
unlike
a
traditional
wit
which
for
me
is
perfect
as
i
hate
the
yeast
used
in
them
and
is
a
style
i
normally
dont
enjoy
this
one
is
easily
drinkable
and
milder
flavored
enjoyed
equally
well
on
a
rerate
and
the
only
beer
classified
as
a
witbier
id
ever
want
to
touch
again
a
suitable
wit
nothing
really
exciting
overall
a
flavorful
wit
very
drinkable
great
white
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
minimal
head
that
fades
fast
no
lingering
head
and
no
lacing
as
the
beer
is
quaffed
there
is
a
strong
orangelike
smell
with
no
hop
aroma
present
however
a
coriander
aroma
and
an
underlying
scent
similar
to
strawberries
is
pleasant
the
taste
is
full
of
coriander
and
citrus
tones
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
there
is
a
lemon
lime
taste
like
sprite
i
wish
this
beer
had
just
a
little
more
spice
to
it
great
white
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
refreshing
level
of
carbonation
not
one
of
my
faves
but
its
a
good
choice
to
beat
the
phoenix
summer
overall
outstanding
taste
refreshing
while
maintaining
some
body
and
lots
of
flavor
make
this
my
favorite
refreshing
style
beer
d
a
pretty
good
wit
could
get
the
appearance
better
but
overall
a
nice
beer
i
could
drink
this
again
i
highly
recommend
a
trial
of
this
beer
it
is
too
unique
to
pass
up
beer
poured
a
yellow
orange
color
not
much
head
upon
pour
into
the
sam
adams
glass
nose
is
mostly
of
malt
and
wheat
and
not
much
else
taste
is
of
those
malts
and
wheats
and
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
is
light
to
medium
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
drinkability
is
not
bad
this
is
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
that
lacks
complexity
and
flavor
to
be
a
superior
beer
wit
or
american
wheat
beer
kind
of
in
the
middle
here
the
spices
are
certainly
present
but
want
to
get
upfront
more
to
really
find
a
niche
amongst
other
belgian
wheat
imitators
overall
this
is
a
decent
witbier
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
summer
staple
if
it
were
more
widely
distributed
had
ontap
served
in
a
pint
glass
appearance
was
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
spices
and
citrus
taste
is
sweet
spicy
and
citrusy
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
smooth
drinkability
is
ok
most
likley
i
will
buy
this
one
again
and
drink
it
again
this
beer
started
out
better
than
it
finished
i
poured
this
beer
from
the
bottle
to
a
45
degree
tumbler
the
beer
wa
straw
colored
and
cloudy
it
had
a
fine
white
bibbly
head
that
decayed
pretty
quick
the
taste
was
slighly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
lemon
which
i
do
not
normally
like
but
this
was
okay
it
was
a
clean
refreshing
summertime
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
d
highly
drinkable
good
tasting
witbier
d
i
was
very
happy
with
this
one
it
is
a
sessionable
brew
that
i
would
look
forward
to
drinking
again
wow
somethings
not
right
here
in
the
taste
either
broad
sweeping
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
but
something
unidentified
is
making
me
wince
as
i
sip
it
and
im
considering
not
finishing
it
its
some
kind
of
artificial
tasting
late
breaking
yeast
note
that
just
stops
me
in
my
tracks
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
this
one
definitely
does
not
agree
with
me
and
i
wont
be
trying
it
again
notes
i
like
it
a
good
interpretation
of
a
white
beer
too
bad
it
doesnt
live
to
being
a
great
one
as
suggested
by
the
name
this
is
a
pretty
bad
wit
but
overall
as
a
beer
it
is
interesting
the
flavor
isnt
bad
at
all
just
very
different
and
not
witlike
drinkability
was
ok
but
would
not
bother
to
try
it
again
a
very
drinkable
beer
easy
drinking
low
abv
not
filling
not
great
but
iid
have
it
again
pours
a
golden
orange
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
fruity
with
just
a
hint
of
corriander
the
taste
is
very
fruity
much
like
the
aroma
and
almost
tastes
like
peachorange
tea
i
really
love
the
orange
and
corriander
flavors
in
a
belgian
wit
but
these
smell
and
taste
artificial
overall
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
but
i
am
put
of
by
the
artificial
flavors
present
in
this
one
i
dont
think
that
i
would
not
purchase
again
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
but
special
nah
drinkability
is
passable
due
to
lightness
of
flavors
but
a
bit
skunky
not
very
enjoyable
an
easy
to
drink
beer
very
refreshing
this
is
a
pretty
light
watery
beer
that
would
probably
be
fine
for
sucking
down
on
a
hot
day
but
your
pay
a
high
craft
beer
premium
for
something
that
essentially
serves
the
function
of
a
macro
light
so
im
not
sure
why
you
would
i
was
disappointed
with
this
lost
coast
offering
and
wont
be
bothering
with
it
again
a
classic
example
of
a
dumbed
down
american
take
on
a
fine
belgian
style
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
surfside
grill
in
crescent
city
ca
its
served
up
with
a
lemon
wedge
and
has
a
dark
golden
color
frothy
thick
head
about
3mm
but
not
any
lacing
it
smells
citrusy
even
after
having
discarded
the
lemon
rind
it
was
served
very
cold
and
tasted
bitter
but
refreshing
and
mainly
of
citrus
flavors
this
is
defnitely
one
of
the
better
witbiers
that
ive
had
not
quite
a
replacement
for
avery
white
rascal
but
close
better
than
blue
moon
or
sunset
wheat
for
sure
ill
definitely
pick
this
one
up
again
disappointing
attempt
at
a
witbier
i
wont
get
this
again
it
just
looks
and
tastes
wrong
and
its
not
very
good
as
a
beer
in
general
style
notwithstanding
this
beer
poured
much
paler
than
i
expected
with
a
very
fizzy
and
fragile
white
head
aroma
is
fairly
spicy
clove
coriander
but
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
quite
flat
and
thin
which
is
a
bit
disappointing
as
is
the
beer
on
the
whole
pours
a
very
pale
tan
almost
like
a
pale
ale
with
little
head
that
disappears
rather
quickly
has
a
strong
citrus
scent
almost
like
fresh
lemons
taste
matches
the
scent
very
citrusy
no
bitter
hop
it
lacks
some
of
the
normal
belgian
white
spice
and
bite
kind
of
bland
washes
the
tongue
with
light
carbonation
and
a
creamy
fluid
true
with
all
belgian
whites
all
in
all
refreshing
not
a
bad
beer
but
falls
a
little
short
of
the
belgian
white
category
notes
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
not
a
big
fan
of
the
brewery
in
general
8
ball
stout
is
decent
but
thats
where
it
ends
in
my
opinion
looks
decent
but
ill
pass
on
this
drinkability
i
like
the
witbier
style
more
than
pale
wheats
and
im
sure
most
bas
would
agree
that
a
straight
wit
wouldve
been
more
interesting
drinkabilitynot
real
impressed
cant
get
past
the
canned
corn
12
oz
glass
bottle
color
of
bright
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
nose
of
bananas
floral
cloves
lightly
hopped
and
spices

taste
of
candied
bananas
hopps
and
spices
body
is
light
and
frothy

aftertaste
of
sweet
hopps
and
spices
pours
pale
yellow
with
the
requesite
floaties
of
an
unfiltered
withminimal
white
head
and
very
little
lacing
some
pearmeloncitrus
scents
mixed
with
light
yeasts
smooth
with
mild
carbonation
the
secret
herb
additives
lend
to
a
unique
flavor
that
in
my
opinion
lasts
a
little
to
long
in
the
finish
all
said
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
an
unforgettable
one
either
d
overall
this
was
fairly
disappointing
for
a
craft
brew
flavor
is
spicy
and
really
refreshing
the
main
thing
you
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
good
to
drink
or
maybe
you
can
say
it
tastes
more
like
a
summer
spice
beer
when
i
first
started
drinking
craftbrews
i
rated
this
pretty
high
but
now
i
have
to
rate
it
above
average
but
not
outstanding
poured
light
straw
colored
gold
maybe
just
a
little
darker
than
i
wouldve
expected
decent
white
head
nose
is
very
floral
as
for
taste
it
is
sweetly
malty
with
notes
of
subtle
orange
theres
plenty
of
citrusy
flavor
going
on
too
carbonation
is
mild
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
session
while
not
an
exceptional
wit
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
thirst
quenching
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
quenching
it
does
remond
me
of
a
wheat
beer
in
that
sense
drinkability
is
average
although
i
would
say
it
would
be
far
more
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
light
white
head
and
golden
color
make
it
a
very
appealing
beer
for
very
hot
days
ive
had
great
white
on
tap
and
it
was
okay
i
recently
had
one
in
the
bottle
so
i
figured
id
rereview
it
quite
frankly
though
i
dont
notice
much
difference
that
could
be
because
of
its
rather
subtle
nature
it
still
has
the
faint
citrusy
scent
and
flavor
a
decent
combo
of
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
a
little
underwhelming
but
its
quite
drinkable
due
to
the
allaround
smoothness
nothing
outstanding
but
certainly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
easily
approachable
but
not
too
exciting
d
i
see
this
as
a
good
refreshment
as
with
other
pale
wheats
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
is
a
complex
and
tough
style
to
brew
definetly
a
good
stab
at
it
id
love
to
try
it
on
tap
worth
a
try
for
those
who
like
the
style
im
not
rushing
back
to
this
but
who
knows
when
ill
run
into
again
overall
a
quite
drinkable
wit
not
a
paragon
of
the
style
but
better
than
blue
moon
light
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
slick
crisp
mouthferel
meh
gold
in
colour
with
only
a
bit
of
haze
lots
of
carbonation
with
a
light
and
spritzy
mouthfeel
one
dimmentional
lemon
cleaner
aroma
flavors
of
lemon
rind
pepper
dill
and
soap
the
unique
herbal
flavors
keep
things
from
getting
too
dull
but
this
is
kind
of
a
weak
belgian
wit
american
wheat
hybrid
over
the
top
orange
essence
in
this
one
with
a
subtle
biscuit
background
why
cant
american
brewers
get
this
style
right
tastes
like
orange
pledge
wood
oil
was
squirted
into
the
beer
a
light
and
easy
witbier
very
drinkable
dunno
if
id
stock
the
fridge
with
it
but
i
could
see
myself
on
a
patio
asking
for
a
second
someday
an
excellent
summer
cooler
drinkability
a
very
good
summertime
quaffer
super
easy
to
drink
this
makes
great
bbq
or
poolside
beer
enough
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
this
beer
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
love
lost
coast
and
find
it
nice
to
see
it
on
the
menu
at
places
i
much
prefer
this
beer
over
the
macro
swill
that
just
doesnt
measure
up
appearance
is
a
murky
yelloworange
color
which
slightly
resembles
a
hefenweizen
little
head
was
present
which
left
very
little
almost
no
lace
smelled
good
slightly
sweet
taste
is
slightly
fruity
and
wheaty
and
again
tastes
slightly
like
hefenweizen
but
more
mild
with
hints
of
citrus
feels
full
in
your
mouth
and
is
kind
of
creamy
i
cant
see
myself
using
this
as
a
session
beer
as
it
is
too
good
and
heavy
but
definately
good
to
drink
a
couple
with
a
meal
or
to
cool
down
from
a
hot
day
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
nice
summer
quencher
drinkability
pretty
high
perfect
springsummer
brew
to
me
this
beer
is
not
a
very
drinkable
brew
the
taste
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
and
it
reminds
me
of
something
that
would
give
you
a
killer
hangover
in
the
morning
some
may
like
that
fruity
taste
but
i
wanted
a
beer
not
a
fruit
punch
i
will
however
not
shy
away
from
trying
other
brews
by
lost
coast
smooth
drinking
wheaty
brew
just
a
note
of
orange
in
the
taste
this
would
make
for
a
good
summer
session
brew
wifey
liked
them
but
i
think
it
could
use
a
stronger
malt
kick
found
this
in
florida
not
availble
in
the
midwest
this
beer
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
smell
is
citrus
and
i
guess
coriander
based
upon
the
other
reviews
dont
really
know
what
coriander
smells
like
though
the
taste
is
okay
the
citrus
although
muted
is
fairly
dominant
wheat
beers
really
arent
my
favorite
style
this
beer
is
okay
im
not
likely
to
buy
it
again
but
its
probably
worth
a
try
as
a
sidenote
i
did
have
a
bottle
left
over
after
this
session
i
tried
it
with
some
pepper
jack
and
crackers
late
night
snack
they
went
fairly
well
together
extremely
drinkable
beer
would
be
especially
enjoyable
during
the
summer
time
nothing
special
pours
a
yellowish
orange
color
with
mild
head
aroma
is
barely
there
not
enough
to
comment
on
with
the
first
sip
the
coriander
jumps
out
and
takes
center
stage
with
barely
there
citrus
flavorsin
the
end
at
the
first
drink
i
gotta
say
i
didnt
like
it
a
few
more
drinks
and
its
ok
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
really
liked
the
brew
a
decent
beer
you
have
to
at
least
try
so
what
do
i
think
its
just
beer
reminds
me
of
the
major
label
beers
with
maybe
a
slight
bit
more
flavor
but
not
much
i
find
it
bland
and
boring
not
offensive
but
not
standing
out
either
if
you
have
only
craft
beers
in
your
house
perhaps
this
would
be
good
for
somebody
who
says
you
got
bud
light
i
will
now
look
for
something
more
flavorful
because
i
feel
like
i
havent
had
a
beer
yet
tap
lost
coast
smelt
ok
lots
of
aroma
unfortunately
it
was
a
bit
sweet
heaps
of
lemon
icing
sugar
thanks
pogo
too
sweet
and
tart
with
nothing
to
back
it
up
finishes
short
yeah
too
sweet
has
a
nice
full
body
but
it
is
sweet
so
it
makes
it
a
little
cloying
and
the
flavour
comes
across
as
a
touch
artificial
even
though
it
most
probably
isnt
pours
a
foggy
orangeyellow
with
a
snowy
white
head
that
leaves
a
clean
corpse
though
short
lived
aroma
has
sweet
malts
and
trix
cereal
i
taste
wheat
with
a
dash
of
sugar
and
orange
citrus
and
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
easy
to
enjoy
many
i
seem
to
enjoy
this
one
better
in
a
party
atmosphere
than
at
home
but
its
good
all
the
same
easy
to
drink
however
to
plain
for
me
and
not
enough
bitter
drinkability
a
light
and
easy
quaffer
perfect
for
beaches
picnics
or
summer
evenings
nothing
too
complex
here
but
certainly
worth
a
try
the
taste
is
mainly
the
yeasty
wheat
flavor
that
you
expect
from
a
wit
sweet
citrus
comes
in
quickly
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
spicy
next
to
no
hop
bitterness
i
think
a
bit
more
bite
in
that
department
would
have
done
some
good
easy
drinking
middle
of
the
road
witbier
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
color
and
is
topped
by
a
frothy
pale

the
aroma
is
interesting
it
has
a
candied
orange
peel
not
to
it
that
is
much
different
than
i
typically
find
in
a
wit
it
is
almost
like
an
orange
cream
soda
with
notes
of
vanilla
the
taste
is
dry
and
tart
up
front
and
the
finish
has
that
note
of
orange
cream
but
it
is
a
bit
subtler
than
the
aroma
there
is
a
very
subtle
earthy
coriander
note
but
this
is
quite
tame
which
is
good
as
i
dont
like
a
strong
coriander
note
in
beer
this
beer
is
nice
and
light
and
quite
quaffable
a
perfect
summer
refresher
not
quite
as
complex
as
the
best
wits
but
still
easily
drinkable
and
this
beer
style
is
my
lawnmowerbeer
of
choice
my
advice
try
1
not
12
pours
a
cloudy
light
golden
color
with
chunks
of
yeast
floating
everywhere
a
12
inch
head
quickly
disappears
leaving
almost
no
lacing
at
all
scent
is
very
mild
slightly
sweet
mild
grapefruit
wheat
and
corriander
are
noticeable
here
but
the
secret
blend
of
humboldt
herbswinkwink
is
nearly
undetectable
mouth
feel
is
light
dry
and
pleasant
enough
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
its
underwhelming
it
tastes
fine
itd
just
overly
mild
still
it
finished
clean
and
is
rather
refreshing
it
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
or
a
session
beer
and
is
quite
complimentary
of
mild
seafood
overall
impression
i
first
tried
this
while
camping
my
way
up
the
california
coast
last
october
tasted
great
after
a
long
day
on
the
road
while
sitting
around
a
campfire
so
i
wanted
to
revisit
and
see
if
it
was
as
good
in
a
less
idylic
atmosphere
sitting
in
my
home
office
this
one
was
still
tasty
in
this
situation
not
the
most
thrilling
beer
out
there
but
a
good
solid
easydrinker
for
the
warmer
days
to
come
if
you
have
a
friend
you
want
to
ease
in
to
better
beer
this
would
be
a
great
choice
cloudy
hazy
light
pale
golden
color
spicy
earthy
citrus
aromas
nice
white
frothy
head
that
sticks
to
the
sides
of
my
glass
fresh
wheat
and
mild
spice
flavors
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
and
drygood
for
the
style
and
very
average
o
k
beer
i
would
drink
this
if
you
gave
me
one
but
i
wouldnt
hunt
it
down
lightmedium
bodied
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
could
be
an
easy
drinker
on
a
warm
day
fairly
refreshing
but
pretty
straightforward
note
i
must
say
while
im
not
wowed
by
this
beer
ourtright
i
have
never
come
across
a
better
pairing
for
sushiit
rocks
bottles
of
this
on
ice
served
in
classy
stemmed
glasses
would
rival
most
snooty
white
wines
warm
florida
breezes
wafting
the
smell
of
mahimahi
on
the
grill
would
be
the
perfect
match
for
this
drinkability
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
take
to
the
beach
or
while
doing
something
relaxing
on
a
hot
summer
day

this
a

the
masses
mouthfeel
is
medium

goes
down
smooth
and
easy
nice
and
drinkable
witbier
just
missing
the
big
flavors
of
a
good

nice

the
summer
time
pours
hazy
gold
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
the
nose
is
fairly
aromatic
with
with
citrus
overtones
this
plain
and
simple
is
really
a
decent
american
wheat
not
too
much
complexity
but
great
drinkability
and
just
enough
interesting
esters
of
fruit
a
summer
beer
that
would
be
a
pleasure
on
a
patio
in
a
mellow
mood
poured
a
light
gold
with
a
slight
amount
of
cloudiness
and
a
weak
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
coriander
and
a
touch
of
fruity
esters
the
flavor
began
with
a
dry
wheat
flavor
balanced
by
a
subtle
hop
bitterness
which
was
quickly
overtaken
by
a
moderate
coriander
citrus
and
a
floral
accent
the
carbonation
level
was
a
little
rough
at
first
making
this
ale
have
a
bit
more
carbonic
bite
when
it
is
really
cold
and
freshly
poured
i
prefer
this
one
without
fruit
and
served
at
a
nice
45
degrees
or
so
to
let
the
wheat
flavors
balance
the
spices
a
bit
more
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
to
have
as
the
spice
is
refreshing
and
the
overall
character
of
the
ale
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
making
it
a
pretty
good
wit
though
the
belgian
examples
i
have
had
had
a
more
champagnelike
carbonation
and
more
character
from
the
yeast
great
white
is
not
a
classic
witbier
it
isnt
bad
but
it
needs
a
more
definitive
sense
of
self
hi
my

is
myron
im
a
great
white
shark
and
i
lack
the

hazy
golden
beer
with
a
shower
of

a

grainy
and
bitter
in

the
finish
body
is
on
the
light
side
but
the
flavor
still
sticks
to
your
tongue
a
nice
witbier
nothing
special
the
beer
deposits
itself
in
the
glass
a
hazy
light
lemon
yellow
with
a
decent
bright
white
head
that
is
semicreamy
in
texture
the
lace
formed
is
a
thin
sheet
to
conceal
the
glass
nose
is
earthy
and
sweet
crisp
and
clean
with
a
slightly
sweet
start
that
has
a
lean
grain
profile
and
a
leaner
top
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidity
the
hops
apropos
to
the
style
i
have
tried
this
beer
two
or
three
times
not
really
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
good
beer
this
is
drinkable
if
you
are
making
tthe
first
tentative
steps
away
from
macro
lagers
i
suppose
it
would
then
seem
flavorful
otherwise
this
is
a
bland
attempt
at
a
witbier
made
attractive
only
by
comparing
its
price
to
that
of
its
belgian
brothers
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
pleasant
wheat
scent
with
a
fruity
yeast
aroma
it
seems
quite
citrusy
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
refreshing
dry
wheat
flavor
with
a
fruity
yeast
finish
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
finishes
a
bit
tart
on
the
tongue
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
wit
it
has
wonderful
aroma
and
flavor
a
great
summer
brew
very
drinkable
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
is
good
without
having
one
outstanding
attribute
this
is
a
brew
that
gets
all
the
basics
right
best
american
wheat
beer
i
have
had
yet
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
during
spring
and
summer
decants
a
cloudy
pale
yelow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
retreats
immediately
the
smell
is
heavily
fruity
with
a
surprising
hop
tang
and
some
citrus
that
must
be
the
natural
flavors
the
label
alluded
to
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
a
slight
bitterness
shows
first
then
mellows
out
into
a
wholly
complex
but
mild
frutiness
green
apples
strawberries
and
lemons
come
to
mind
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
refreshing
with
a
big
blast
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
fine
but
would
be
great
in
july
around
midday
the
citrus
herb
flavors
are
somewhere
between
full
and
extreme
the
beer
may
become
better
if
toned
down
a
little
bit
i
dont
know
on
some
levels
this
beer
was
appealing
and
quite
drinkable
it
made
for
a
decent
change
of
pace
on
the
other
hand
the
overarching
perfumey
nature
of
this
beer
was
rather
offputting
try
and
reach
your
own
conclusions
as
for
me
the
jurys
still
out
and
its
heading
for
a
hungjury
drinkability

i
thought
the
big
grapefruit
was
a
little
off
but
otherwise
this
was
a
valiant
attempt
at
this
difficult
style
for
all
its
faults
its
a
very
drinkable
brew
would
be
great
in
the
summer
heat
22oz
brew
bottled
in
august
2003
appears
a
hazy
golden
with
a
white
short
lived
head
nice
webbed
even
lacing
a
pleasant
citrusy
spiced
up
wit
delivers
a
smooth
slightly
bready
yeast
note
through
my
senses
overall
light
and
spiced
up
with
some
tropical
fruit
like
annuances
tastes
zesty
citrusy
zeal
it
with
spices
and
syrupy
textured
sugar
very
tasty
and
dessert
like
hold
the
twist
of
lemon
for
me
this
ones
packing
enough
flavor
sharp
sweet
tone
from
the
malted
wheat
due
their
duty
nice
micro
brewed
wit
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
slightly
sticky
texured
very
nice
high
carbonation
going
on
drinkability
definitely
brings
me
back
to
the
summertime
just
one
of
those
brews
desigined
for
warm
weather
beware
this
stuff
is
very
drinkable
if
your
catholic
rootsim
irish
catholic
so
i
can
joke
dont
make
you
an
alcoholic
this
stuff
will
the
apperance
is
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
very
white
head
i
could
see
come
sediment
in
the
glass
guess
its
the
yeast
at
least
i
hope
it
is
the
smell
is
kind
of
like
roasted
pnuts
and
some
wheat
the
taste
is
more
wheat
than
anything
but
not
too
heavy
on
it
its
well
balanced
and
not
all
hopped
up
like
some
brews
of
the
same
genre
the
bottom
line
is
that
i
really
like
it
and
will
get
more
than
a
single
next
time
as
far
as
american
wit
beers
made
on
the
west
coast
this
one
is
definitely
at
the
head
of
the
class
the
tendency
of
brewers
on
the
west
coast
is
to
flood
wheat
beers
with
so
much
hops
that
they
eventually
taste
like
sierra
neveda
pale
ale
i
am
not
a
style
maven
by
any
means
but
when
you
try
a
beer
and
it
tastes
like
a
style
that
is
different
than
what
it
claims
to
be
that
can
be
aggrevating
this
beer
had
a
great
hint
of
citrus
in
the
aroma
and
a
nice
sweet
initial
taste
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
i
had
this
in
the
22oz
variety
and
it
seemed
that
most
of
the
spices
were
down
in
the
yeast
sediment
it
had
a
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
mildly
creamy
head
my
only
complaint
is
that
i
did
not
buy
another
one
to
bring
with
me
back
to
the
east
coast
im
not
sure
if
you
cant
get
their
beers

a

the

very
mild

finding
a
theme
here
not
a
bad
offering
from

but
not
terribly
inspiring
either
light

an
unfiltered

a
lighter

beer
typical
of
a
wheat
beer
taste
is
a
little
citrusy
flavor
is
mild
not
much

taste
most
of
the
flavor
is
in
the
spices
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
on
the
palate
it
is
soft
and
smooth
making
me
wonder
where
all
of
that
lemon
juice
went
creamy
with
sucrose
sweetness
there
is
a
decent
lashing
of
dried
powdery
bitterness
on
the
finish
all
the
same
lowacid
to
a
fault
seems
a
little
too
designed
for
my
taste
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
beer
it
completely
lacked
the
crispness
i
like
in
a
wheat
in
fact
it
was
a
bit
watery
in
my
opinion
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
i
really
like
this
wheat
beer
this
light
unfiltered
beer
poured
a
hazy
light
straw
gold
in
color
with
no
foam
the
smell
was
of
a
malty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
wheat
the
flavor
of
barley
malts
wheat
and
spice
was
very
well
balanced
the
combination
of
malts
wheat
and
spice
with
a
hint
of
a
spritzy
citrus
at
the
end
made
this
wheat
beer
a
pleasant
quincher
a
nice
bittersweettangy
finish
the
aroma
and
taste
reminded
me
of
a
belgium
style
ale
overall
far
from
complex
indeed
simply
put
this
is
just
a
floral
wheat
beer
with
strong
citric
elements
and
a
persistent
herbal
dimension
still
this
is
nicely
balanced
and
a
great
beer
for
sinking
whilst
sat
outside
on
a
warm
sticky
night

drinkable

highly
refreshing

is
a
very
very
light
beer
with

touch
while
retaining
the
complexities
of
phenols
and
esters
one
would
want
in
a
wit
if
i
could
find
this
for
under
5
a
bottle
id
make
it
a
regular
in
my
fridge
even
at
that
price
for
the
way
this
approaches
the
realm
of
a
sour
beer
itll
make
repeat
appearances
overall
tons
of
flavor
and
a
lot
of
tanginess
a
very
nice
witbier
excellent
example
of
a
wit
bigger
and
more
complex
than
hoegaarden
but
just
as
refreshing
overall
i
like
witbiers
in
general
and
the
products
of
st
bernardus
in
particular
so
this
was
bound
to
be
a
winner
for
me
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
if
your
idea
of
a
good
witbier
stops
at
hoegaarden
or
blue
moon
then
you
owe
it
to
yourself
and
your
palate
to
check
this
out
its
in
a
completely
different
league
o
a
pretty
great
beer
a
fantastic
blend
of
flavor
for
a
witbier
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
that
trails
the
glass
smells
of
belgian
wheat
with
sweet
fruits
like
banana
and
fresh
bread
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
with
light
sweet
notes
finishing
with
a
crisp
mint
flavor
that
i
enjoyed
would
highly
recommend
not
going
into
great
detail
suffice
to
say
a
glass
of
cloudy
brilliance
o
a
killer
witbier
huge
aroma
loaded
with
flavour
but
finishes
clean
and
dry
excellent
mouthfeel
did
not
enjoy
too
much
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
a
strong
iron
smell
like
a
strong
mineral
smell
supposed
yeast
bear
but
does
not
taste
like
bread
initial
taste
is
like
mineral
water
almost
no
flavour
then
it
has
a
yeast
taste
that
becomes
kinda
strong
which
was
slightly
bitter
overall
at
first
thought
it
was
too
light
all
around
but
after
several
sips
flavour
builds
and
it
all
comes
together
as
a
subtle
brew
not
trying
too
hard
simple
and
highly
drinkable
pure
and
clean
excellent
overall
rating
b
its
late
so
im
doing
an
overall
portion
on
this
review
the
appearance
is
world
class
hazy
as
hell
and
unfiltered
just
how
i
like
it
the
aroma
has
that
straw
and
wheat
sweetness
with
bold
spices
and
subtle
fruity
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
of
unfiltered
wheat
grains
and
spices
corianderpeppercorns
faint
metallic
with
a
great
nobel
hop
finish
dry
and
semisweet
with
lingering
peppercorns
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
i
can
crush
this
all
day
long
this
brew
is
recommended
overall
quite
simply
the
best
wit
ive
ever
had
thats
complicated
yet
refreshing
flavourful
yet
eminently
drinkable
recommended
for
beer
lovers
of
all
ages
and
expertise
o
incredible
beer
definitely
my
favourite
of
the
style
i
have
tried
thus
far
and
this
is
probably
my
second
favourite
style
next
to
you
guessed
it
hefeweizen
prior
to
drinking
this
beer
blanche
de
chambly
was
my
favourite
in
this
style
but
this
completely
blew
it
out
of
the
water
at
its
price
its
more
of
a
luxury
beer
rather
than
an
everyday
drink
but
as
a
change
of
pace
treat
you
cant
do
much
better
an
amazing
beer
that
is
complex
but
at
the
same
time
incredibly
drinkable
highly
recommended
enjoy
final
grade
4
55
an
outstanding
a
grade
it
took
me
a
few
sips
to
get
the
hang
of
what
they
were
going
for
here
but
in
the
end
its
not
hard
to
see
why
st
bernardus
witbier
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
best
commonlyseen
example
of
the
style
this
beer
doesnt
seek
to
overwhelm
your
senses
with
a
variety
of
exotic
adjuncts
or
spicy
features
its
beautifully
balanced
plain
delicious
and
simply
a
pleasure
to
drink
a
musttry
unless
you
just
arent
a
fan
of
the
style
to
begin
with
i
think
its
rated
as
the
highest
witbier
and
i
can
see
why
definitely
one
of
the
best
delicious
take
on
the
style
i
love
the
bready
malt
presence
and
the
fact
that
its
not
bubblegum
or
banana
laden
until
the
finish
nothing
special
i
would
have
guessed
a
belgium
ipa
not
a
wit
o
this
is
the
best
witbier
ive
had
ive
had
hoegaarden
alagash
blance
de
chamby
hitachino
etc
and
this
style
is
really
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
i
think
this
beer
is
a
bit
underrated
and
deserves
more
attention
on
ba
mouthfeel
is
the
best
thing
here
great
body
and
big
carbonation
mediumlight
body
stingy
medium
carbonation
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
really
nice
brew
for
hot
summer
days
would
have
again
o
good
witbier
although
for
me
not
as
great
as
the
majority
think
overall
a
great
belgian
witbier
very
good
mix
of
yeast
coriander
and
fruit
flavors
one
of
the
best
for
the
style
this
is
a
crisp
enjoyable
beer
and
i
dont
taste
the
5
5
anywhere
a
very
nice
beer
that
i
am
glad
i
had
a
chance
to
try
worthy
if
you
like
wit
beers
o
quite
fine
overall
bold
spicing
balanced
enough
though
it
could
use
a
touch
more
body
and
malt
flavor
maybe
a
bit
too
sharp
and
dry
overall
pricey
but
an
above
average
wit
for
sure
it
has
a
perfect
balance
of
flavours
and
a
great
mouthfeel
a
delightful
witbier
but
a
little
pricey
to
drink
regularly
its
a
pity
since
beers
like
this
are
made
to
be
sessioned
in
the
summertime
very
glad
i
tried
it
and
will
likely
revisit
when
the
mercury
rises
cost
notwithstanding
taste
dry
pepper
can
taste
faint
citrus
that
changes
into
a
heavy
yeast
aftertaste
most
witbeirs
have
a
sweeter
citrus
taste
this
does
not
rather
than
the
pulp
of
citrus
fruits
this
tastes
like
the
peel
not
a
bad
thing
but
different
from
most
witbeirs
i
have
had
light
carbination
with
a
very
dry
finish
o
definitely
recommended
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
brewery
typical
of
the
style
but
delicious
cloudy
sunny
peach
color
capped
by
a
slender
creamy
white
head
aromas
of
cracked
wheat
fresh
oranges
creamy
vanilla
sweetness
light
on
the
spice
with
some
smooth
wellintegrated
coriander
citrusy
lightly
spiced
flavor
with
a
notable
wheaty
twang
a
touch
of
clove
and
some
yeast
dry
textured
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
lingering
tanginess
that
makes
for
a
refreshing
easydrinking
wit
a
wellcrafted
wit
from
st
bernardus
which
comes
as
no
surprise
a
nice
tasting
beer
that
smooth
and
very
fruity
with
a
good
refreshing
finish
it
went
down
very
well
and
was
exactly
what
ive
come
to
expect
from
a
good
example
of
the
style
simple
with
a
good
balance
but
pulled
off
well
poured
from
330
ml
bottle
into
a
duvel
tulip
glass
this
brew
is
allegedly
quite
close
to
pierre
celis
original
hoegaarden
recipe
and
is
widely
regarded
as
a
decent
stab
at
what
genuine
witbier
used
to
taste
like
before
the
style
became
industrialized
and
relatively
insipid
this
sort
of
snobbery
aside
i
do
see
what
the
critics
mean
st
bernardus
wit
is
a
milky
banana
yellow
hue
super
cloudy
and
infused
with
particulate
material
from
yeast
aroma
is
correspondingly
yeasty
sweet
citrusy
and
spicy
with
a
touch
of
belgian
funk
and
a
decent
burst
of
clove
phenolics
few
north
american
wits
smell
like
this
palate
features
indian
round
coriander
seed
lemony
and
slightly
tannic
but
not
overpowering
orange
rind
sweet
grainy
malt
that
combines
with
the
citrus
to
evoke
lemon
meringue
pie
and
a
surprisingly
rich
earthy
spice
that
prevents
things
from
being
too
sweet
dry
and
woody
in
fact
with
sour
apple
notes
and
a
touch
of
butterscotch
in
the
finish
nicely
carbonated
which
is
to
say
highly
so
should
this
be
deemed
the
witbier
platonic
ideal
quite
possibly
although
dare
i
say
that
i
prefer
the
more
aggressive
unibroue
yeast
in
blanche
de
chambly
its
almost
a
dead
heat
between
these
two
in
the
st
bernardus
trappist
influenced
take
reviewed
here
everything
is
truly
in
its
right
place
and
the
overall
effect
is
earthy
spicy
dry
and
as
wellcalibrated
as
a
swiss
watch
precise
and
technically
proficient
but
still
a
work
of
art
in
the
belgian
beer
sense
what
to
say
herejust
try
this
looked
at
this
one
for
years
and
never
grabbed
one
wow
do
i
feel
like
a
dummy
o
at
once
highly
refined
and
well
crafted
but
also
free
from
pretension
in
its
simplicity
this
is
a
witbier
done
right
and
a
great
go
to
for
a
light
beer
when
you
dont
necessarily
need
the
extreme
boldness
of
other
styles
perfect
executed
wit
very
smooth
and
packed
with
assertive
flavors
o
really
good
brings
elements
of
a
belgian
abbey
ale
to
the
witbier
game
cheers
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
the
spices
are
very
much
present
but
they
dont
overwhelm
the
simpler
grain
characteristics
giving
it
nice
drinkability
i
also
personally
like
the
slightly
tart
element
to
the
beer
because
it
makes
it
nice
and
refreshing
would
definitely
buy
again
in
a
4pack
now
that
ive
had
it
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
but
too
expensive
to
enjoy
often
onice
belgian
wit
good
flavor
and
could
drink
this
a
lot
even
better
in
summer
i
havent
had
many
witbiers
but
i
wouldnt
think
you
could
go
too
far
wrong
with
this
one
good
value
too
for
good
belgian
beers
when
you
can
find
it
here
over
all
i
gave
it
a
little
higher
because
it
is
well
constructed
the
flavors
move
along
nicely
and
i
know
there
are
lots
of
fans
that
love
these
flavors
if
someone
offered
me
one
i
would
be
delighted
and
enjoy
it
but
i
would
not
spend
my
hard
earned
cash
for
what
it
sells
for
again
when
i
could
buy
something
else
i
enjoy
more
good
flavorful
experience
but
not
exactly
my
flavors
or
favorite
style
for
reference
my
favorite
styles
are
big
sweet
belgian
strong
dark
ales
bruins
and
dubbels
overall
very
well
balanced
a
great
beer
all
around
its
a
very
filling
and
satisfying
so
not
something
you
want
to
have
two
or
three
of
its
a
beer
to
sit
down
with
for
a
while
enjoy
the
nuances
in
it
and
have
a
good
time
smooth
beer
very
easy
drinking
good
carbonation
good
beer
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
but
it
this
beer
is
any
indication
will
be
seeking
it
out
more
it
goes
down
easy
yet
is
nice
and
complex
would
be
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
a
good
one
to
savor
as
there
is
a
lot
going
on
here
i
could
easily
drink
more
of
this
overall
one
of
the
better
witbiers
i
have
had
to
date
wellbalanced
with
citrus
belgian
yeast
earth
characters
and
wheat
not
sure
it
is
worth
over
au140
a
case
2013
but
one
every
now
and
then
would
be
fine
very
refreshing
drinkable
and
wellbalanced
citrus
hops
cut
with
a
malty
sweetness
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
without
getting
filled
up
nothing
outstanding
but
a
solid
summer
session
brew
the
taste
is
far
more
sweet
than
i
might
have
expected
with
roasted
pale
malts
belgian
sugars
citrus
and
a
finish
that
is
low
in
bitterness
the
sweetness
is
the
leader
witbiers
are
about
midway
on
my
list
of
favorite
styles
but
i
could
drink
this
one
regularly
pours
a
hazy
straw
golden
with
a
pure
white
fluffy
one
and
half
finger
head
frantastic
retention
plenty
of
lacing
light
citrus
notes
coriander
and
just
an
edge
of
earthiness
on
the
nose
smooth
and
velvety
on
the
palate
with
just
a
touch
of
creaminess
opens
with
gentle
fruit
notes
with
some
citrus
zest
joined
by
clove
and
some
earthiness
yeast
makes
it
presences
wellknown
middle
palate
with
most
some
grain
and
ample
malt
finishes
with
some
light
tart
notes
one
of
the
better
witbiers
available
and
wonderful
beer
overall
this
is
the
gold
standard
of
witbiers
the
taste
is
smooth
and
intense
balanced
and
pure
perfection
is
it
worth
3x
the
price
of
blue
moon
yes
willi
keep
a
stash
for
regular
consumption
no
but
then
i
am
a
dark
beer
fanatic
and
only
drink
witbier
for
refreshment
a
must
try
to
experience
the
potential
of
the
style
overall
worthy
of
being
named
best
witbier
in
the
world
easily
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
encountered
the
complexity
from
the
yeast
alone
was
great
but
the
rest
of
the
flavors
were
also
great
exactly
what
a
belgian
white
should
be
seek
this
out
if
you
enjoy
wheats
sours
or
belgian
ales
absolutely
phenomenal
wit
o
a
nice
witbier
but
im
honestly
not
sure
i
could
tell
this
from
the
bmc
versions
it
is
a
bit
spicier
and
drier
i
believe
but
its
similar
for
sure
maybe
my
palate
just
isnt
quite
there
for
witbier
either
way
id
take
an
allagash
white
over
this
any
day
aftertaste
there
isnt
a
big
aftertaste
here
the
spices
stick
around
but
leave
me
with
a
subtle
drying
finish
requiring
me
to
take
another
sip
i
will
say
about
this
style
if
you
are
new
to
craft
beer
this
isa
goodsafe
way
to
start
nearly
every
brewing
company
makes
a
wheatwhite
beer
so
if
you
are
new
to
craft
beer
start
here
funny
story
last
night
in
the
beer
class
a
guy
likes
the
maui
bikini
blonde
ale
more
than
anything
we
tried
he
would
love
this
beer
oh
well
glad
i
got
to
try
this
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
it
was
fun
learning
about
the
pierre
celis
connection
to
this
brewerybeer
cheers
people
o
not
much
bad
to
say
about
this
one
strait
forward
in
a
good
way
very
sessionable
bravo
o
my
first
offering
from
st
bernardus
and
i
am
very
pleased
with
my
choice
great
summer
beer
or
even
for
year
round
extremely
refreshing
and
crisp
smooth
such
an
easy
and
tasty
beer
to
drink
a
very
excellent
witbier
in
all
respects
very
nicely
balanced
with
some
interesting
things
going
on
great
complexity
and
yet
so
easy
and
tasty
to
drink
i
would
maybe
prefer
a
bit
less
sweetness
and
more
hops
the
wheat
here
adds
a
delicious
smooth
creamy
character
great
beer
though
o
a
solid
wit
but
unexceptional
for
the
style
recommended
but
not
particularly
compelling
othis
wit
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
as
you
would
expect
from
a
true
belgian
things
are
balanced
while
erring
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
there
is
no
gimmickry
or
funny
business
and
none
is
necessary
here
to
create
solid
flavors
i
wouldve
liked
to
compare
this
to
the
toyko
wit
in
a
headsup
comparison
because
my
recollection
is
that
that
beer
is
also
quite
nice
brightly
sweet
with
notes
of
orange
and
citrus
its
quite
fruity
the
coriander
is
there
as
well
but
is
restrained
when
compared
to
what
the
aroma
was
also
clear
its
a
wheat
beer
towards
the
finish
the
sweet
seems
to
carry
the
day
here
though
with
coriander
in
the
back
presentation
packaged
in
an
eleven
point
two
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
sealed
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
cheers
witbier
that
does
not
exaggerate
on
the
spices
that
is
good
what
i
miss
is
the
typical
sweetness
for
balance
not
my
favorite
witbier
o
i
will
grant
you
this
my
not
be
a
fair
review
i
dislike
wheat
beers
stouts
and
ipas
are
my
thing
the
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
that
foams
this
up
nicely
across
the
palate
without
being
overly
fizzy
or
harsh
closes
out
semidry
with
little
to
no
residual
stickiness
across
the
palate
consistenty
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
beers
the
look
of
it
is
picture
perfect
hazy
yellow
with
a
lingering
sensual
head
the
smell
is
sort
of
spicy
with
coriander
coming
through
but
also
a
mix
of
orangebanana
i
smell
the
taste
is
top
notch
the
spices
are
dominant
but
banana
orange
and
some
grassy
notes
come
through
to
really
balance
out
this
beer
paired
with
chicken
and
dumplings
this
is
a
near
perfect
meal
overall
this
is
what
every
witbier
should
strive
to
be
like
to
me
this
is
the
absolute
defining
beer
of
the
style
and
by
far
the
best
wit
i
have
ever
had
i
only
wish
i
could
get
this
close
to
where
i
live
because
i
would
go
through
cases
during
the
summer
overall
an
excellent
witbier
just
wish
it
was
cheaper
and
easier
to
find
it
is
great

an

o
this
is
on
of
those
wits
that
sets
the
standards
for
all
others
bright
in
aroma
and

where
others
wits
are
often
muted
refreshing
beer
o
i
bought
the
st
bernardus
mix
pack
just
for
this
beer
and
it
did
not
disappoint
this
is
a
real
witbier
they
dont
make
em
like
this
anymore
its
way
too
drinkable
and
even
i
was
surprised
by
how
quickly
i
drained
my
glass
it
really
hit
the
spot
even
in
the
dead
of
winter
they
really
need
to
get
this
beer
over
here
in
volume
especially
toward
the
summer
months
i
gave
this
very
high
marks
due
to
the
sublteness
yet
still
present
of
the
spices
m
medium
bodied
creamy
good
carbonation
dry
finish
pours
a
murky
butter
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
and
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
wheat
spices
yeast
and
a
perfumelike
citrus
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
spice
finish
that
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
prickly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
a
great
smell
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
jd
o
excellent
wit
one
of
the
best
overall
a
good
and
refreshing
beer
while
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
call
it
the
top
witbier
in
the
world
pour
is
hazy
pale
yellow
with
bubbly
white
head
the
nose
is
zesty
and
spicy
peppery
and
lemony
zest
well
balanced
the
taste
is
the
same
well
integrated
and
balanced
spice
an
zesty
lemon
juice
body
is
airy
clean
and
crisp
with
solid
carbonation
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
with
a
smallish
white
head
which
lasts
reasonably
well
but
does
not
leave
much
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
delicately
fragrant
blend
of
sweet
coriander
lemon
zest
and
orange
blossom
with
some
faint
medicinal
notes
subtle
lemon
peel
up
front
leads
into
some
sweet
and
spicy
coriander
a
typically
crisp
witbier
feel
is
balanced
nicely
against
honeyed
orange
blossom
notes
in
the
midpalate
the
finish
is
redolent
with
sweet
spice
and
lingers
nicely
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
very
cloudy
golden
color
with
huge
head
that
took
a
while
to
dissipate
aroma
seems
to
be
lacking
a
bit
and
smells
almost
stale
with
hay
and
grass
some
faint
yeast
good
carbonation
with
decent
mouthfeel
flavor
follows
rather
dry
yeasty
and
very
little
sweetness
or
spice
on
this
one
i
was
expecting
something
mind
blowing
and
felt
that
this
was
rather
run
of
the
mill
maybe
its
right
on
style
but
i
prefer
a
little
additional
sweetness
in
this
style
decent
brew
overall
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
could
have
more
variedcomplex
spices
and
acidity
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
but
does
carry
forth
the
proper
characteristics
of
the
style
represented
maybe
im
missing
something
here
ba
but
this
just
doesnt
blow
my
mind
it
looks
the
part
of
a
world
class
beer
huge
foaming
white
head
resting
forever
on
top
of
a
just
slightly
hazy
very
pale
summery
yellow
body
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
rising
eagerly
to
the
surface
it
also
leaves
beautiful
patchy
thick
white
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
tulip
as
i
drink
this
its
really
pretty
the
nose
though
does
not
match
the
looks
it
smells
faintly
like
lemon
peel
but
all
i
can
really
ascertain
from
the
smell
is
a
pretty
standard
belgian
yeast
light
and
a
little
fruity
its
a
little
stinky
like
maybe
mine
isnt
the
freshest
bottle
but
still
it
just
doesnt
smell
all
that
great
the
flavor
is
nice
its
very
very
light
a
nice
wheat
malt
profile
with
some
grassy
notes
plays
against
just
a
touch
of
bitter
lemon
and
the
doughy
yeast
its
in
fine
balance
but
its
not
a
very
bold
flavor
well
made
yes
but
almost
boring
the
feel
is
fine
light
in
body
made
heavier
by
the
suds
on
top
and
the
yeast
sediment
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
active
and
fizzy
overall
a
nice
beer
but
im
not
sure
id
score
it
quite
as
high
as
the
masses
have
here
a
contemplative
beer
more
for
a
relaxing
evening
drink
or
a
warm
day
descent
wit
holds
up
against
many
other
examples
of
the
style
o
this
is
a
nice
witbier
that
is
different
than
most
witbiers
that
ive
had
the
usual
banana
clove
and
bubblegum
flavors
are
dialed
down
a
bit
and
the
yogurtlike
tanginess
is
dialed
up
i
shouldve
known
better
belgian
beers
never
fit
the
mold
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
really
tasty
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
wellsuited
for
the
hot
summer
months
cant
say
ive
had
a
better
belgian
witbier
this
is
really
good
o
a
pretty
witbier
overall
thats
also
very
unique
its
almost
more
like
a
saison
or
some
belgian
pale
ales
than
a
witbier
still
its
enjoyable
a
great
beer
i
will
surely
get
this
one
again
overall
this
was
a
a
beer
i
like
that
it
is
light
enough
on
the
abv
and
thin
enough
on
the
mouthfeel
to
be
an
easy
beer
to
drink
my
only
complaint
is
that
for
the
style
the
st
bernardus
was
on
the
darker
side
of
the
witbiers
i
think
i
remember
liking
hoegaarden
better
since
it
is
lighter
and
has
a
refreshing
lemon
character
the
st
bernardus
wit
is
a
great
beer
with
outstanding
flavors
that
i
would
certainly
warrant
picking
up
if
i
ever
saw
it
at
the
beer
store
again
o
definitely
an
above
average
witbier
great
blend
of
citrus
and
spicy
flavors
i
expected
a
bit
more
richness
and
depth
but
its
still
a
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
an
exceptional
little
wit
beer
lots
of
character
and
a
real
delight
to
drink

followed
by
the

light

i
liked
the
start

but
the
middle
was
a
bit
sharp
and
dry
for
me
interesting
for
a
change
but
ill
more
likely
return
to
the
double
and
triple
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy

bright
orange
with
a
thin
head
of
clean
white
foam
orange
and
coriander
were
apparent
up
front
notes
of
pine
came
through
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
was
quite
clean
with
the
expected
citrus
zest
and
wheat
coming
through
this
beer
is
quite
clean
in
the
mouth
with
lots
of
flavor
up
front
but
is
also
light
and
sharp
with
limited
residual
sweetness
once
you
swollow
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
light
wheat
beer
with
great
flavor
that
very
drinkable
overall
truly
an
exemplar
of
the
style
probably
the
best
classic
witbier
i
have
had
however
i
slightly
prefer
charlevoixs
dominus
vobiscum
blanche
as
i
find
the
addition
of
chamomile
to
that
beer
to
really
introduce
an
unusual
element
that
works
wonders
however
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
and
very
enjoyable
definitely
going
to
be
my
beer
of
choice
for
warm
weather
whenever
i
can
get
my
hands
on
it
big
in
flavor
yet
subtle
at
the
same
time
its
good
temp
43f
o
not
worldclass
imo
but
certainly
excellent
o
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
in
this
style
and
extremely
refreshing
this
beer
would
be
awesome
on
a
warm
summer
evening
and
i
could
definitely
enjoy
many
of
them

overall
this

as
i
would
have
hoped
unfortunately
it
is
a
bit
difficult
to
find
unlike
the
rest
of
the
lineup
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
high
marks
goes
down
well
with
some
live
santana
or
miles
davis
electric
period
type
from
an
outdoor
fest
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
there
were
lots
of
things
i
liked
but
a
few
things
that
i
didnt
its
something
id
happily
drink
again
in
the
future
but
there
are
other
beers
id
like
to
try
first
overall
except
for
the
bigbottle
format
this
is
a
really
good
sessionable
belgian
beer
d
after
initially
reviewing
what
i
though
was
a
bad
bottle
of
this
beer
i
can
now
see
thats
just
the
way
this
beer
is
i
enjoyed
it
more
now
than
then
but
this
just
doesnt
quite
do
it
for
me
although
this
is
certainly
a
departure
from
what
i
know
as
a
witbier
its
still
a
great
beer
and
one
i
know
ill
be
revisiting
down
the
road
but
overall
this
one
just
didnt
deliver
like
i
had
hoped
a
good
beer
but
ill
be
reaching
for
a
hoegaarden
before
this
in
the
future
that
is
until
i
try
more
witbiers
this
beer
defies
witbier
overall
im
disappointed
the
soapy
taste
is
just
too
strong
for
me
to
get
past
o
i
feel
like
this
is
an
excellent
wit
if
i
had
only
had
a
fresh
one
it
was
just
too
malty
this
is
an
easy
drinking
witbier
its
not
very
complex
but
its
well
balanced
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
witbier
o
a
light
and
easy
drinker
wouldnt
ever
turn
this
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
would
give
this
a
great
summer
spring
time
beer
rating
its
lightness
and
coloration
remind
me
of
such
fantastic
beer
o
a
good
white
but
nothing
special
o
delicious
and
by
far
the
best
witbier
ive
ever
had
m
complex
but
excellent
and
balanced
combination
not
light
but
with
a
good
ending
the
ending
is
not
to
dry
but
it
is
a
little
bitter
not
a
hops
bitterness
but
more
a
peel
citrus
bitterness
t
delicious
wheat
flavour
all
the
aroma
is
replicated
on
the
taste
refreshing
with
medium
body
some
crisping
on
tongue
dr
easy
to
drink
but
of
poor
quality
abv
is
average
nothing
special
here
o
st
bernardus
can
do
no
wrong
imo
and
this
is
yet
another
proof
of
that
great
wit
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
and
will
seek
out
extensively
next
summer
overall
a
good
beer
i
was
expecting
a
little
bit
more
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
still
a
must
try
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
not
everyone
goes
through
this
cycle
but
i
did
and
here
i
am
sitting
down
drinking
a
st
bernardus
wit
and
feeling
like
i
am
in
heaven
what
a
clean
tasty
refreshing
subtle
finely
crafted
beer
this
is
the
flavors
have
been
described
many
times
over
so
i
do
not
feel
the
need
to
do
it
myself
just
know
that
i
have
never
had
anything
in
the
style
that
is
better
and
i
can
count
on
two
hands
the
number
of
beers
that
compete
with
in
in
terms
of
drinkability
amazing
beer
a
different
beast
than
its
cousin
abt
12
but
dare
i
say
it
an
equally
good
beer
exceptionally
good
witbier
and
indeed
one
of
the
pinnacles
of
the
style
refreshing
fragrant
crisp
and
drinkable
you
cant
ask
for
anything
more
t
pear
banana
and
a
big
dose
of
cloves
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
for
me
but
the
flavors
were
really
great
drinkability
crisp
clean
very
refreshing
i
can
and
do
drink
this
beer
often
overall
a
very
nice
beer
too
bad
its
12
99
4
pack
seemed
to
fit
the
style
fairly
well
almost
some
german
hefe
things
in
it
o
theres
a
reason
this
is
the
1
witbier
its
full
of
flavor
body
and
super
refreshing
highly
recommended
for
the
style
or
during
the
summer
months
the
beer
is
hazy
yellow
with
a
thick
dense
white
cap
plenty
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
snifter
the
aroma
brings
wheat
coriander
orange
peel
yeast
lemons
delicious
flavor
slightly
tart
lemons
with
hints
of
belgian
yeast
and
a
mild
spice
character
everything
is
integrated
beautifully
really
easy
to
drink
full
of
flavor
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
and
smooth
on
the
palate
i
definitely
recommend
this
beer
if
i
wasnt
such
a
beer
nerd
wanting
to
try
everything
in
sight
i
would
have
easily
ordered
another
o
this
is
a
very
nice
wit
try
it
youll
like
it
overall
nice
white
more
spicy
than
others
in
the
style
this
is
the
topreviewed
beer
of
this
style
out
of
any
that
have
more
than
just
a
handful
of
reviews
and
i
feel
its
deserved
buy
it
drink
it
love
it
if
wits
are
your
thing
this
is
the
beer
to
buy
o
this
is
a
really
high
quality
witbier
with
great
craftsmanship
all
around
and
a
solid
blend
of
smell
flavor
and
feel
i
admit
though
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
complex
and
layered
when
i
had
this
its
hard
to
poke
holes
in
this
beer
in
the
end
though
very
little
wrong
and
a
lot
right
going
for
it
dont
see
how
you
could
like
witbiers
and
not
seek
this
one
out
for
a
try
this
is
undoubtedly
the
smoothest
and
best
witbier
ive
ever
had
poured
into
a
chalice
a
cloudy
pale
bronzed
yelloworange
with
a
beautiful
head
of
delicate
white
bubbles
that
retained
pretty
much
throughout
the
session
and
left
some
nice
lacing
biscuity
aroma
belgian
yeast
sugar
and
spice
and
citrus
zest
very
bready
and
earthy
taste
and
very
complex
and
fullflavored
for
a
witbier
flavors
of
yeast
sugar
lemon
pear
banana
corriander
pepper
all
wrapped
in
an
incredibly
smooth
package
that
you
just
dont
get
from
a
typical
wit
probably
the
only
wit
that
ive
had
that
id
call
mediumbodied
with
full
flavor
and
rich
texture
and
definitely
easily
drinkable
but
to
be
savored
o
quite
tasty
and
incredibly
easy
drinking
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
without
a
problem
nice
representation
of
style
light
and
drinkable
but
tons
of
flavor
class
act
credit
to
wits
overall
though
this
really
reminds
me
more
of
a
hefeweizen
but
its
almost
like
a
cross
hybrid
interesting
easy
drinking
no
problem
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
with
some
coriander
and
lemon
notes
mixed
in
the
aroma
is
a
little
muddy
smelling
overall
with
nothing
really
standing
out
the
flavor
is
better
than
the
aroma
i
get
a
lot
of
wheat
with
some
orange
peel
coriander
and
pepper
notes
light
watery
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
and
a
very
good
start
to
my
night
id
recommend
it
and
if
you
can
get
it
for
under
10
dollars
do
it
another
winner
from
st
bernardus
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
even
if
you
are
not
a
wit
fan
this
is
a
must
try
d
a
solid
and
respectable
witbier
however
the
st
bernardus
label
leaves
me
expecting
a
bit
more
there
is
nothing
outstanding
nor
detracting
i
can
think
of
several
other
less
expensive
witbiers
that
i
would
opt
for
over
this
one
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
growing
to
like
it
and
this
is
probably
the
best
wit
ive
had
lively
carbonation
that
turns
to
light
foam
in
the
mouth
very
refreshing
exactly
like
the
nose
indicates
so
juicy
and
succulent
and
friendly
with
food
balance
is
uncanny
starts
with
coriander
light
honey
and
then
moves
to
orange
lemon
grass
belgian
spices
light
earthy
tones
some
grassy
herbaceous
qualities
into
a
soft
creamy
then
bubbly
long
finish
a
wit
i
plan
to
drink
much
more
of
overall
an
immense
drink
i
might
go
right
now
and
order
a
whole
crate
of
the
stuff
drinkability
im
not
sure
if
this
bottle
was
long
in
the
tooth
or
what
but
this
did
not
live
up
to
the
reviews
i
read
beforehand
nor
the
pedigree
of
st
bernardus
light
mouthfeel
that
finishes
dry
an
excellent
wit
o
really
good
beer
full
flavored
but
light
bodied
quite
refreshing
on
a
warm
spring
day
d
definitely
worth
a
pickup
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
approachable
for
most
this
beer
pours
smoothly
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
the
beer
is
a
murky
yellow
look
that
looks
like
a
traditional
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
a
very
fruity
light
wheat
flavor
it
has
flavors
of
pineapple
oranges
sweetness
and
lemons
the
after
taste
lingers
a
little
bit
with
hints
of
lemon
a
good
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
cheers
nose
of
exotic
fruit
which
can
be
identified
as
pineapple
or
mango
and
some
spices
moreover
it
is
fairly
well
balanced
with
the
presence
of
wheat
that
brings
a
touch
of
sweetness
easy
drinking
slightly
spicy
one
perceives
in
a
final
taste
lemon
to
clean
witbier
a
little
bitter
its
true
but
it
is
negligible
which
is
a
little
deception
the
flavor
is
very
soft
with
tartness
resembling
mild
lactic
sourness
unmalted

into
the
st
bernardus
goblet
st
bernardus
really
puts
out
some
great
beers
this
one
is
probably
one
of
the
better
wits
on
the
market
this
beer
pours
out
as
an
opaque
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
very
lively
some
big
time
citrus
coming
through
on
the
nose
there
is
also
a
good
amount
of
yeast
there
too
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
semisweet
citrusy
upfront
and
fades
to
a
bread
like
softness
in
the
after
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
but
it
also
has
a
few
bubbles
in
there
that
like
to
dance
on
your
taste
buds
o
this
is
tasty
mellow
and
very
easy
to
drink
you
cant
go
wrong
with
anything
from
st
bernardus
overall
just
an
excellent
wit
spiciness
and
bitter
citrus
is
not
overdone
and
the
complex
yeast
flavors
are
excellent
i
love
this
brewery
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
white
head
bubbly
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
prototypical
whitbier
some
sweet
malt
up
front
and
tart
citrus
on
the
back
of
the
palate
this
beer
has
a
crisp
thirst
quenching
body
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
nose
but
there
are
elements
of
spice
and
belgian
yeast
nice
witbier
appearance
a
bit
cloudy
with
a
nice
orange
hue
smell
is
pleasant
and
aromatic
you
can
smell
the
fruity
hops
and
coriander
taste
is
clean
with
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
on
the
palette
its
sparkling
but
not
to
much
i
kind
of
like
my
wits
a
bit
more
subtle
refreshing
to
drink
this
will
be
a
very
nice
beer
to
have
in
the
summer
on
those
really
hot
days
a
beer
that
will
be
kept
on
hand
regularly
d
great
drinkability
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
what
a
white
ale
should
be
overall
enjoyable
a
very
nice
wit
basically
this
sets
the
bar
for
the
style
a
bit
more
artisanal
than
hoegardeen
with
more
complex
flavors
and
subtleties
really
enjoyed
this
one
highly
recommended
d
definitely
a
tasty
wit
beer
and
a
worthy
offering
to
any
fan
of
wits
the
flavours
were
unique
and
memorable
and
the
mouthfeel
would
make
this
one
a
perfect
afternoon
patio
beer
d
nice
beer
but
i
wasnt
completely
wowed
like
many
other
reviewers
comments
i
am
a
big
fan
of
witbiers
and
st
bernardus
has
easily
become
my
favorite
as
a
reference
point
allagash
white
ale
used
to
be
my
wit
of
choice
but
i
consider
that
to
be
a
distant
second
now
this
beer
is
pretty
pricey
but
i
like
it
so
much
i
find
myself
continuing
to
buy
it
despite
the
price
premium
d
one
of
the
few
wit
to
stand
up
to
hoegaarten
drinkability
is
high
the
weather
is
warm
here
today
and
tomorrow
a
nice
little
respite
from
old
man
winter
perfect
beer
for
a
day
like
this
would
be
excellent
on
a
hot
summer
day
gotta
love
wits
and
hefes
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
creamy
white
head
smells
of
old
bakers
yeast
taste
is
light
citrus
up
front
followed
by
a
light
grainy
bread
middle
a
hint
of
bubblegum
and
a
yeasty
phenolic
finish
mouthfeel
is
smooth
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
meh
by
far
the
least
impressive
st
bernardus
beer
ive
had
for
the
price
this
is
totally
not
worth
it
imo
the
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
a
lower
amount
of
carbonation
then
id
like
the
finish
is
crisp
tart
and
slightly
dry
not
bad
but
also
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
could
drink
this
all
night
but
frankly
after
one
im
bored
put
that
with
the
price
tag
of
4
a
bottle
and
i
am
totally
out
worth
a
try
if
you
just
got
paid
and
have
a
finsky
burning
a
whole
in
your
pocket
other
then
that
find
a
better
wit
drinkability
it
was
very
drinkable
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
and
st
bernardus
has
never
let
me
down
it
is
almost
sessionable
and
would
be
willing
to
try
to
do
just
that
drinkability
about
average
for
a
wheat
beer
d
easy
sipping
beer
but
tartness
is
too
much
for
me
nice
high
carbonation
it
has
a
very
sharp
taste
citrus
dominates
again
but
the
beer
is
not
sour
by
any
means
very
refreshing
d
light
and
easy
to
drink
a
pleasure
to
the
palate
another
great
wit
cheers
pours
an
extremely
murky
milky
goldstraw
color
almost
like
unfiltered
apple
juice
there
is
a
small
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
scent
is
yeasty
bready
spicy
and
fruity
i
get
wheat
and
green
apples
with
coriander
and
light
lemon
taste
is
initially
lemony
with
a
bit
of
tartness
and
green
apple
then
i
get
delicious
wheat
and
bread
notes
with
belgian
yeast
making
this
one
tasty
wit
it
end
with
sweet
coriander
bananas
and
a
small
amount
of
hoppiness
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
and
crisp
full
of
flavor
and
body
drinkability
is
high
this
could
be
one
of
the
best
wits
ive
ever
had
d
very
drinkable
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
while
mowing
the
lawn
or
having
a
bbq
mouthfeeldrinkability
it
is
a
bit
more
sour
and
kind
of
acidic
in
the
aftertaste
the
body
is
very
light
but
the
carbonation
seems
kind
of
heavy
st
bernardus
can
do
no
wrong
its
really
refreashing
would
def
have
again
however
when
the
beer
warms
the
colve
over
takes
a
lot
of
flavor
drinkability
light
refreshing
creamy
and
quaffable
i
dig
this
stuff
a
lot
if
this
looks
like
a
tick
review
its
only
because
this
beer
is
so
easy
to
describe
its
exactly
what
its
supposed
to
be
with
no
sidetrips
really
good
was
expecting
a
little
more
asertiveness
one
way
or
another
on
the
aroma
didnt
really
get
much
beyond
the
wheatyness
and
breadyness
do
agree
there
is
some
acidity
or
citrusy
component
mixed
in
there
but
kinda
hard
to
nail
down
kinda
like
that
refreshing
as
all
hell
on
the
pallet
bright
yet
soft
clean
yet
full
of
flavor
a
smidge
tart
but
very
drinkable
really
like
this
beer
and
seems
to
open
and
grow
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
definitely
good
mouth
feel
with
this
beer
medium
smooth
great
carbonation
combined
with
the
low
alcohol
content
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
for
me
although
the
sweetness
hinders
it
a
bit
this
beer
poured
nicely
with
a
light
frothy
head
and
an
excellent
smell
lightly
spicy
with
hints
of
cloves
and
lemon
and
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
is
pleasantly
subdued
making
the
beer
easy
to
drink
without
over
powering
the
palate
a
great
beer
on
a
warm
late
summer
afternoon
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
nice
white

decent
amount
of
lacing

with
a
bit

some
clove
character
and
a
bit
of

taste
is
similar
although
nothing
stands
out
too
much
somewhat
bland
compared
with
the
nose
much
of
the
taste
component
is
dominated
by
the
mouthfeel
which
is
quite
nice
and
refreshing
a
very
easydrinking
beverage
overall
excellent
beer
overall
a
terrific
representation
of
the
style
great
smooth

persistent
carbonation
this
is

drinkable

is
easily
the

a

refreshing
as
opposed
to

cloying
mouthfeel

lightbodied
but
feels
more
substantial
due
to
the
lively
effervescence
that
leaves

at

this
has
to
be
one
of
my
top
five
witbiers
to
date
an
excellent
offering
that
is
great
for
summer
consumption
quite
expensive
for
a
witbier
this
was
a
disappointment
st
bernardus
is
usually
quality
stuff
a
complex
cheekily
understated
and
at
the
same
time
solid
example
of
the
style
the
old
world
leanings
toward
nuance
over
intensity
practically
leap
out
of
the
glass
but
really
dont
yknow
easy
to
drink
and
for
the
style
strangely
compelling
in
the
sense
of
making
me
actually
consider
acquiringopeningborrowing
another
d
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
this
would
pair
remarkably
well
with
some
fish
or
chicken
d
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
it
is
fairly
light
and
easy
to
drink
the
flavor
also
is
not
to
far
on
the
sweet
side
to
keep
me
from
another
glass
ill
give
drinkability
a
very
good
rating
abv
is
a
little
high
for
a
session
beer
but
its
spoton
perfect
for
a
beer
to
have
with
your
barbequed
chicken
or
grilled
salmon
st
bernardus
definitely
knows
how
to
make
witbier
great
offering
from
st
bernardus
almost
on
par
with
their
quad
flute
glass
pour
and
i
am
met
with
a
cloudy
straw
colored
ale
with
a
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
aroma
consists
of
pears
green
apples
and
malt
crisp
and
clean
taste
with
some
major
pear
action
going
on
and
a
refreshing
fruity
aftertaste
light
mouthfeel
with
some
bubbly
carbonation
distracting
somewhat
very
easy
drink
as
a
750
ml
was
consumed
with
ease
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
it
overall
this
was
another
nice
beer
from
a
great
brewery
and
drunk
on
a
hot
day
contributed
to
the
positive
nuances
of
this
beer
beer
is
thin
and
slightly
dry
spiciness
is
minimal
overall
a
good
beer
its
mildly
sweet
and
has
a
wheaty
graininess
at
the
back
end
creamy
mouthfeel
very
nice
overall
highly
drinkable
i
love
watou
a
lot
ideas
form
fellow
taster
d
overall
a
great
wit
this
is
a
staple
of
the
style
hard
to
get
your
hands
on
but
well
worth
seeking
out
although
the
bottle
is
10
months
old
i
can
tell
this
is
a
wonderful
witbier
its
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
refreshment
at
5
5
its
a
very
wonderful
session
beer
for
the
summer
d
my
friends
comment
is
accurate
its
a
bad
chord
on
a
guitar
that
sounds
good
at
the
end
with
each
sip
of
this
beer
you
wonder
if
you
made
the
right
choice
or
a
mistake
but
after
you
stop
and
let
the
notes
sink
in
it
it
grows
on
you
like
a
song
you
like
the
3rd
time
you
listen
to
it
d
could
drink
this
all
week
if
i
could
afford
it
like
other
st
bernardus
beers
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
yeast
and
sediment
after
pouring
into
a
glass
appearance
was
a
hazy
oat
color
produced
about
one
finger
of
head
made
me
burp
a
lot
which
i
always
take
as
a
good
sign
smelled
of
malt
and
apple
cider
fruit
malt
and
wheat
definitely
come
through
along
with
very
subtle
hops
great
light
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
low
abv
but
still
rich
and
full
bodied
served
from
bottle
into
stone
nonic
poured
a
nice
golden
cloudy
yellow
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
subsides
to
a
thin
layer
upon
sitting
there
was
minimal
lacing
evident
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
bananas
and
malt
notes
the
flavor
present
were
bananas
malt
slight
wheat
and
apples
upon
swallowing
very
nice
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
brew
i
was
thoroughly
surprised
at
some
of
the
flavors
i
encountered
while
drinking
this
one
a
definite
must
try
d
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
thats
thirst
quenching
and
also
packs
in
a
lot
of
interesting
flavors
best
wit
ive
ever
had
hands
down
pierre
celis
out
did
himself
with
this
one
again
the
only
complaint
is
that
its
pricey
dvery
refreshing
crisp
and
smooth
it
would
be
my
go
to
beer
throughout
the
summer
but
its
kind
of
expensive
for
me
it
was
the
best
witbier
i
have
tried
some
other
examples
of
this
style
leave
a
very
fake
acidiccitrus
flavor
in
my
mouth
that
kind
of
gets
to
me
after
awhile
swirl
poured
into
a
wit
glass
two
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
soon
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
collour
is
a
cloudy
brownish
apricot
strong
fluffy
lacing
smells
a
mild
bread
with
apple
spice
tastes
include
apple
orange
coriander
well
balanced
lots
going
on
nice
and
light
refreshing
fine
carbonation
helps
a
nice
finish
no
problem
drinking
a
few
of
these
good
aroma
but
the
flavour
lets
it
down
the
tea
flavour
is
just
not
quite
right
in
the
beer
mouthfeel
carbonated
and
dry
perhaps
a
bit
too
dry
for
my
preference
in
this
style
drinkability
is
great
its
well
balanced
which
keeps
any
one
element
from
overwhelming
the

d
an

slightly
above

better
than
blue

some
of
the
others
allagash
white
is
my
litmus
i
may
try
it
again
if
i
can
get
it
fresh
but
otherwise
i
will
pass
all
in
all
its
a
good
one
in
this
style
but
not
great
id
pick
several
others
but
occasionally

mouthfeel

of
carbonation
bottle
home
my
favorite
witbier
so
far
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
beigeyellow
with
a
big
frothy
head
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
clean
grain
and
earthy
yeast
good
notes
of
wheat
spice
coriander
and
citrus
peel
the
flavor
is
lemony
yeasty
and
dry
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
pillowy
two
finger
creamy
headthe
smell
is
very
nice
with
aromas
of
pearsorange
peelwhite
grapes
and
a
feint
touch
of
corrianderit
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
which
is
neither
thin
nor
thick
with
tastes
of
pearswhite
grapesorange
peel
and
also
some
lemon
and
corrianderoverall
a
really
good
example
of
a
witbier
and
would
definately
buy
again
and
would
love
to
try
it
with
some
seafood
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
is
an
excellent
drinking
beer
one
that
i
could
drink
year
round
but
especially
in
the
summertime
overall
this
is
an
amazing
beverage
this
is
a
great
way
to
wake
up
the
senses
you
can
enjoy
this
beverage
and
appreciate
the
history
time
and
dedication
involved
great
work
indeed
overall
a
great
summer
beer
to
complement
st
bernarduss
predominantly
cold
weather
beers
pours
a
luminous
and
hazy
golden
hue
with
white
head
consisting
of
larger
than
average
bubbles
nose
has
a
tempting
citrus
with
some
dessertlike
captiviness
such
as
a
lemony
glaze
on
a
donut
on
the
palate
theres
an
amazing
sweet
n
sour
contrast
with
soft
wheat
breadiness
more
lemony
flavors
and
good
carbonation
through
to
the
finish
inspiring
flavors
on
each
sip
yet
also
drinkable
nice
beer
an
exceedingly
easydrinking
light
bodied
wit
thick
mouthfeel
creamy
lemon
tartness
bitter
orange
zest
and
some
corriander
compared
to
similar
beers
it
seems
to
be
lacking
in
spice
finished
with
a
funky
chalky
dry
yeast
flavor
undesirable
aftertaste
there
are
better
witbiers
out
there
that
cost
significantly
less
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
without
a
doubt
this
is
the
finest
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
with
a
healthy
but
quicklyfading
white
head
that
leaves
very
little
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
a
subtle
melange
of
wheat
coriander
lemongrass
and
a
bit
of
bread
the
taste
follows
nicely
including
the
subtlety
a
tasty
collaberation
of
coriander
wheat
clove
lemon
zest
and
even
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
back
the
body
is
medium
at
best
has
a
good
amount
of
effervescent
carbonation
and
does
not
malinger
all
the
makings
of
a
highly
drinkable
wit
d
a
great
belgian
beer
not
that
i
havent
tried
better
witbiers
before
but
this
one
is
a
solid
choice
d
very
drinkable
well
balanced
and
refreshing
light
abv
makes
it
a
perfect
summertime
refresher
citrus
notes
contribute
to
the
taste
as
well
carrying
through
the
palate
the
richness
of
the
wheat
is
evident
throughout
as
well
giving
the
beer
a
full
and
rich
feel
without
a
dense
sweetness
carbonation
settles
from
the
initial
blast
to
support
the
texture
well
and
opening
up
the
nose
further
concludes
with
a
light
citric
sweetness
that
lingers
nicely
very
nice
theres
a
welcome
stinging
carbonation
balanced
by
a
silkysmooth
mouthfeel
its
pretty
hearty
for
a
witbier
and
quite
drinkable
d
goes
down
super
smooth
very
hearty
for
a
5
5
abv
brew
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
found
this
to
be
a
different
witbier
than
what
i
have
tasted
this
one
is
very
fruity
almost
like
a
tropical
drink
i
do
want
it
again
and
it
was
enjoyable
however
for
the
high
price
i
think
there
are
better
alternatives
d
very
drinkable
av
very
good
wit
beer
i
liked
this
quite
a
bit
comments
im
trying
to
find
something
negative
about
this
beer
and
cant
other
than
the
price
this
has
to
be
the
pinnacle
of
witbiers
if
this
one
doesnt
get
a
perfect
score
then
perfection
is
not
possible
since
it
cant
be
possible
to
improve
this
brew
d
this
is
a
really
got
witbier
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
around
this
one
is
full
of
flavor
and
a
bit
spicier
than
most
of
the
other
examples
wonderful
overallthe
only
thing
that
keeps
this
from
being
an
a
witbier
in
my
book
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
good
but
a
bit
over
carbonated
and
the
body
could
be
smoother
a
perfect
thirst
quencher
as
drinkable
as
they
come
if
only
it
were
july
spicier
than
other
wits
i
have
had
but
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
d
very
easy
to
drink
drinkability
this
is
definitely
a
beer
to
drink
again
it
has
a
clean
crisp
flavor
that
is
refreshing
smooth
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
beer
to
drink
again
in
the
future
whenever
and
where
ever
it
is
found
after
paying
5
99
for
my
bottle
of
st
bernardus
witbier
at
world
market
in
montgomery
i
was
expecting
something
fantastic
what
i
got
was
an
overpriced
witbier
that
didnt
taste
any
different
than
any
other
witbier
out
there
it
tasted
good
with
wheat
accents
but
the
sticker
shock
was
more
than
i
could
stand
i
think
ill
stick
with
the
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
or
the
sam
adams
white
ale
this
ones
just
another
overpriced
and
overrated
import
this
beer
is
a
little
different
than
most
white
beers
that
i
have
had
because
its
lacks
sweetness
instead
it
gives
us
a
tart
lemon
and
orange
taste
that
leaves
a
tangy
finish
it
also
has
a
smell
that
is
similar
to
a
fresh
cut
orange
the
color
is
a
cloudy
gold
and
white
with
a
white
head
this
beer
is
pretty
pricey
and
i
would
probably
spend
my
money
on
blanche
de
chambly
hoegaarden
white
rascal
ect
because
they
have
more
flavor
and
are
cheaper
although
it
is
good
to
try
if
you
want
a
dryer
white
beer
that
is
made
from
the
brewer
of
hoegaarden
this
beer
is
okay
this
was
drank
on
a
cold
windy
day
the
lounge
was
however
warm
and
is
very
well
appointed
beautiful
paintings
and
ornaments
an
ideal
place
to
review
beers
from
the
brewery
next
door
and
highly
recommended
for
a
stay
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
unibroue
tulip
fluffy
white
head
with
interesting
soapy
sticky
sticky
lacing
aroma
is
of
clove
banana
and
belgian
yeast
taste
follows
suit
and
is
smooth
as
a
babys
bottom
with
absolutely
no
hint
of
alcohol
brilliant
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
wits
in
the
world
paired
well
with
a
gaggle
of
deviled
eggs
properly
carbonated
and
good
mouthfeel
for
its
style
the
carbonation
helps
to
wake
up
the
taste
buds
excellent
drinkability
i
had
no
trouble
taking
down
the
bottle
myself
paired
nicely
with
some
simple
cheese
and
crackers
pretty
carbonated
let
warm
up
a
little
at
fridge
temp
it
has
little
flavor
as
it
warms
up
a
little
fruity
sour
citrus
very
light
and
drinkable
bottle
at
chaucers
pours
cloudy
hazy
yellow
with
a
good
frothed
bleach
white
cap
the
aroma
is
full
of
yeast
and
lactic
components
which
surprising
lots
of
funk
some
fruity
esters
very
yeasty
a
touch
of
clove
the
flavour
profile
is
very
tart
citrus
some
hints
of
banana
spices
but
lots
of
funky
sour
yeast
finishes
creamy
in
fact
almost
too
creamy
with
lots
of
funky
yeast
in
the
finish
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
but
perhaps
just
a
bit
too
biting
to
really
qualify
as
highly
drinkable
o
a
great
session
beer
to
share
with
those
who
love
great
beer
pale
yellow
with
fluffy
white
head
forming
a
plateau
aroma
of
bananas
and
citrus
with
a
slightly
bitter
edge
tastes
of
bitter
grapefruit
and
bread
with
hints
of
black
pepper
a
fairly
standard
wheat
beer
refreshing
enough
but
not
the
brewers
strength
what
a
great
beer
if
this
was
more
affordable
it
could
possibly
replace
weiheinstephaner
as
my
wheat
beer
of
choice
good
full
bodied
beer
with
a
soft
but
high
carbonation
to
me
this
is
the
benchmark
mouthfeel
for
a
belgian
wit
rather
good
witbier
here
not
my
style
at
all
got
this
from
a
friend
but
im
impressed
smells
spicy
yeasty
clovey
this
has
an
excellent
mouthfeel
might
be
the
first
time
ive
ever
thought
that
from
a
beer
its
a
creamy
carbonation
tastes
nice
and
spicy
light
n
tasty
i
love
when
a
beer
surprises
you
drinkability
is
high
in
this
id
have
lots
more
if
i
had
anymore
well
done
d
this
is
a
fairly
neutral
beer
for
a
wit
but
i
enjoyed
it
the
flavors
werent
overpowering
like
some
beers
can
be
for
this
style
very
refreshing
soft
carbonation
up
front
making
it
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
spice
notes
slightly
breadyyeasty
with
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
peel
corriander
ripe
banana
and
peppery
lemon
zest
very
drinkable
with
a
sweet
dry
finish
i
love
st
bernardus
and
it
was
obvious
that
their
worldclass
witbier
was
going
to
be
a
winner
for
me
i
was
a
bit
taken
back
by
how
insanely
drinkable
it
is
though
great
stuff
and
worthy
of
its
rep
light
to
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
very
refreshing
and
probably
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
wits
great
to
drink
anytime
of
year
but
really
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
a
world
class
beer
here
im
not
happy
about
the
price
here
in
calgary
but
what
can
i
do
t
bubbly
upfront
which
transitions
into
a
thick
smooth
flavor
of
savory
honey
by
the
middle
its
a
little
tangy
in
the
finish
and
overall
sports
a
long
balanced
flavor
exceptionally
balanced
would
be
an
absolute
killer
on
a
hot
day
if
it
wasnt
for
the
high
price
tag
d
definitely
one
of
the
best
belgian
wits
ive
had
if
not
the
best
the
perfect
example
of
its
style
and
what
all
other
wits
should
strive
to
be
i
cant
say
i
noticed
much
difference
if
any
between
the
regular
st
bernardus
witbier
and
the
pierre
celis
signature
selection
for
all
i
can
tell
they
are
the
exact
same
beer
note
they
are
and
in
any
event
i
seem
to
enjoy
them
both
every
bit
the
same
if
i
was
to
toast
the
legendary
pierre
celis
the
godfather
of
witbier
it
would
certainly
be
with
a
glass
of
this
fine
ale
light
bitter
hop
finish
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
nice
and
refreshing
a
classic
wit
probably
the
most
enjoyable
wit
ive
ever
had
or
at
least
can
recall
sampling
these
four
bottles
went
quickly
and
i
have
a
hankering
for
more
like
i
said
above
this
is
not
a
complex
wit
but
a
well
crafted
well
put
together
wit
all
the
same
very
high
quality
and
very
satisfying
drinkability
is
very
good
this
is
a
very
clean
tasting
wit
a
great
nose
and
taste
to
it
and
that
finishes
in
a
very
pleasant
manner
best

six
pack
sampler
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellowgreen
with
a
small
white
head
into
my
goblet
head
is
gone
quickly
and
no
carbonation
remains
in
the
appearance
this
beer
looks
like
lemon
lime
gatorade
but
follows
style
no
lacing
is
really
left
and
this
is
the
only
weak
appearance
aspect
of
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
of
wheat
belgian
spices
orange
lemon
apricots
and
other
fruits
citrus
is
definitely
high
in
this
one
some
yeast
in
there
maybe
too
mouthfeel
is
light
with
pretty
high
carbonation
good
for
the
style
drinkability
is
high
on
this
one
very
light
good
fruityspicy
flavors
only
thing
that
sucks
is
the
price
tag
st
b
does
good
once
again
note
as
the
beer
warms
a
little
more
comes
out
in
terms
of
flavor
but
thats
nothing
new
unfortunately
i
enjoy
this
style
around
40
degrees
not
55
d
i
would
liken
this
beers
drinkability
to
chocolate
milk
its
sweet
and
thick
but
somehow
you
still
want
to
down
it
notes
this
is
a
very
tasty
witbier
with
a
solid
texture
and
deeply
hazy
appearance
by
far
the
greatest
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
feel
it
was
like
drinking
silk
this
beer
was
so
smooth
and
refreshing
it
was
perfect
for
the
hot
day
for
a
wit
i
find
this
too
thick
and
balanced
too
far
in
favor
of
the
spice
a
good
beer
but
not
what
im
looking
for
in
the
style
wow
sums
this
beer
up
perfectly
drinkability
very
drinkable
with
a
lower
abv
a
great
summer
refresher
and
excellent
with
a
slice
or
lemon
or
orange
thrown
in
my
third
go
around
with
the
pierre
celis
wit
not
bad
but
i
definitely
prefer
the
flavor
profile
of
their
normal
wit
or
the
allagash
offering
still
worth
a
try
though
wonderful
example
of
this
style
this
is
a
beautiful
and
almost
perfect
example
of
a
wit
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
has
a
very
sizeable
3
finger
head
that
lingers
for
awhile
smell
is
of
citrus
and
light
corriander
possibly
taste
is
where
this
beerso
shines
wonderful
light
and
perfect
in
every
way
slight
citrus
notes
finish
perfectly
crisp
and
so
drinkable
this
is
a
session
beer
for
sure
it
just
doesnt
get
much
better
for
this
style
of
beer
unreal
notes
while
hitting
on
the
right
notes
im
not
sure
this
is
any
better
a
witbier
than
say
allagash
white
picked
up
this
wit
in
the
750ml
corked
bottle
i
slowly
poured
this
into
a
beer
glass
lots
of
head
even
with
the
slow
pour
still
wound
up
with
40
head
i
set
the
bottle
down
and
head
was
still
comming
out
the
bottle
slowly
in
a
2
inch
thick
tower
upon
initial
smell
it
was
very
yeasty
and
sour
with
slight
hints
of
lemon
orange
and
corriander
the
flavor
was
outstanding
wit
and
hefewiesen
are
my
favorite
types
of
beer
and
this
one
is
an
award
winner
it
might
have
been
my
imagination
but
in
tasting
i
got
a
hint
of
the
minerals
from
the
artisian
water
they
use
the
main
taste
is
crisp
lemony
wit
i
finished
the
bottle
in
no
time
i
now
must
try
all
the
other
offerings
from
st
bernardus
d
goes
down
easy
never
boring
great
summer
brew
this
was
the
first
stop
on
my
tour
of
st
bernardus
beers
up
next
are
pater
6
prior
8
and
abt
12
4
5
d
no
significant
flaws
and
good
complexity
make
this
very
drinkable
d
a
good
drinkable
wit
but
i
think
i
prefer
them
sharper
and
more
spicy
d
this
is
a
very
good
wit
beer
st
bernardus
does
not
drop
the
ball
on
this
one
d
an
excellent
summer
beer
id
drink
it
more
often
if
it
wasnt
twice
as
expensive
as
other
wits
drinkability
this
bottle
may
have
been
tainted
first
off
i
stored
it
on
its
side
but
set
it
upright
prior
to
the
pour
allowing
any
yeast
that
may
have
been
there
to
mix
into
the
beer
second
this
bottle
came
from
sidewalk
market
a
k
a
nonas
in
slo
which
is
a
breeding
ground
for
sunlightdamaged
beers
all
that
said
i
thought
this
tasted
like
a
cheap
lemonade
mimosa
no
thank
you
notes
my
sister
enjoyed
other
witbiers
allagash
white
hoegaarden
so
maybe
i
will
spring
for
one
of
these
for
her
to
try
sometime
soon
this
is
a
style
defining
witbier
taste
is
great
as
well
light
and
citrusy
this
is
a
beer
i
feel
like

clove
in
the
aroma
taste
was
just
sublime
with
just
the
right
amount
of
orange
in
the
taste
and
light
spiciness
very
smooth
creamy
and
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
one
more
bottle
my
wife
doesnt
like
this
style
of
beer

one
excellent
birreria

m
d
is
very
nice
this
is
medium
bodied
and
goes
down
very
smooth
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
all
day
during
the
summer
d
4

a
very
beautiful
fine
well
rounded
witbier
according
to
style
a
better
feel
would
make
this
even
more
refreshing
all
in
all
this
is
for
sure
a
tastey
burger
i
would
easily
buy
this
again
pours
a
golden
colored
body
very
cloudy
yellow
whitish
head
diminishing
very
fruity
fizzy
aroma
banana
spicy
lots
of
aromas
fizzy
fruity
taste
some
spice
cooling
aftertaste
some
dusty
might
be
the
malts
tasty
with
the
spices
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
sweet
and
creamy
but
slightly
spicy
at
first
very
smooth
finish
very
good
drinkability
would
definitely
have
this
beer
again
this
is
the
best
wit
beer
ive
ever
had
man
i
wish
they
carried
this
here
in
vegas
next
time
i
take
a
trip
to
california
im
going
to
make
sure
to
pick
up
a
number
of
bottles
of
this
a
truly
superb
brew
from
our
belgian
brothers
md
the
attenuated
but
incredibly
refreshing
carbonation
underlines
the
delicious
profile
and
a
full
body
just
perfectly
keeping
the
palate
intact
throughout
the
drink
never
going
thin
at
5
5abv
the
body
is
110
full
as
evinced
by
a
solid
maltysugary
backbone
while
the
spicyyeast
and
lightly
bitter
edge
helps
to
ensure
a
perfect
balance
all
in
all
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
luckily
tasted
feel
and
drinkability
delicate
and
light
on
the
palate
perfect
i
dont
think
ive
had
anything
that
felt
this
delicate
on
the
palate
very
light
body
fleeting
almost
this
one
may
not
be
as
robust
or
as
forward
as
my
two
favorites
southampton
and
wittekerke
but
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
surpasses
them
in
all
aspects
i
am
really
quite
amazed
at
the
feel
on
this
beer
just
a
real
nice
soft
round
smoothness
with
a
subtly
dry
finish
easy
to
drink
ill
be
picking
this
one
up
again
and
im
sure
the
impression
it
will
have
on
me
in
the
summer
will
be
even
greater
really
drinkable
extremely
quenching
and
refreshing
right
on
for
this
style
served
at
slightly
below
cellar
temperature
this
beer
was
intensely
carbonated
although
not
quite
a
gusher
its
a
brownishtan
color
with
lots
of
cloudiness
and
haze
beautiful
selfsustaining
head
with
a
decent
amount
of
lace
the
aroma
is
where
this
beer
starts
to
get
good
though
lots
of
clove
and
spice
its
almost
tealike
in
the
aroma
accompanied
by
plenty
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
smells
even
better
is
the
taste
refreshing
and
slightly
sweet
with
coriander
and
a
wonderful
risingdough
flavor
the
tartness
keeps
the
beer
drinkable
smooth
despite
the
carbonation
perfect
for
a
sunny
afternoon
clean
light
taste
with
a
citrusy
zestyeasty
with
subtle
spicyness
light
and
tangy
mouthfeel
a
nice
summer
beer
expected
just
a
bit
more
tastebut
not
bad
at
all
overall
i
think
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
it
is
pretty
light
and
refreshing
d
very
nice
smooth
and
easy
drinking
d
very
drinkable
would
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
glowing
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
white
champagnelike
1

finger
head
that
stays
through
duration
lots
of
lacing
smell
is
strong
of
orange
coriander
taste
is
wheat
orange
coriander
yeast
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
acidic
finish
is
crisp
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
witbier
im
struggling
with
this
one
i
love
originality
and
this
wit
is
quite
different
from
most
theres
something
that
puts
this
beer
over
the
line
to
odd
i
wouldnt
be
reaching
for
another
but
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
one
over
all
was
a
good
beer
flavors
and
smells
were
a
little
subtle
was
hoping
for
a
more
bold
taste
bottle
that
it
came
in
was
nice
just
wish
that
it
tasted
as
good
as
it
looked
a
pale
yellow
slightly
cloudy
beer
has
a
huge
ice
cream
soda
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lace
notes
of
coriander
and
citrus
rise
from
the
glass
with
a
peppery
background
there
is
a
very
smooth
and
luxurious
mouth
feel
spicy
pepper
notes
join
with
the
coriander
and
the
chew
wheat
character
before
the
snappy
citrus
notes
carry
it
down
your
throat
drinkability
is
good
but
the
finish
is
not
that
nice
a
good
beer
and
not
too
pricy
a
must
try
for
fans
of
wits
my
expectations
where
met
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
would
of
liked
a
little
more
spice
to
come
out
in
the
flavor
but
otherwise
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
cheers
d
a
standardbearer
for
witbiers
although
i
wish
it
was
a
little
bit
more
lush
and
less
astringent
and
drying
the
rest
of
the
package
is
topnotch

d
exceedingly
drinkable
delicious
crisp
refreshing
even
for
a
borderline
sessionable
beer
abvwise
at
least
this
beer
is
a
real
sipper
could
really
only
drink
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
after
that
it
would
be
pushing
it
taste
and
complexity
really
make
this
beer
a
treat
though
d
a
good
wit
from
the
st
bernardus
guys
pricey
for
what
it
is
but
a
beer
i
could
definitely
have
again
quite
easy
to
drink
i
love
beers
of
this
style
and
this
is
easily
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
very
tasty
witbier
and
its
a
little
different
than
many
but
is
worth
a
try
for
sure
d
the
head
on
this
beer
made
me
want
to
shrink
down
and
take
a
bubble
bath
in
the
glass
fantastic
all
the
way
around
pierre
celis
continues
with
the
tradition
of
bringing
heavenly
nectar
within
reach
it
has
great
a
great
white
head
that
disappeared
in
to
a
wonderful
white
lace
the
hazy
orange
body
perfectly
carbonated
it
has
a
mainly
citrus
aroma
like
fresh
oranges
but
not
over
powering
but
at
the
same
time
tart
it
has
a
spicy
orange
flavor
a
little
candy
and
adjunct
it
is
bitter
sweet
and
sour
there
are
a
lot
of
complex
flavors
to
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
very
drinkable
overall
very
good
an
excellent
belgian
wit
i
typically
like
a
witbier
and
this
ones
no
different
although
this
is
a
rather
different
witbier
based
on
my
previous
experiences
i
could
have
a
few
during
an
evening
but
would
rather
switch
up
i
would
not
want
to
sit
down
and
kill
a
six
pack
d
easily
drinkable
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
if
the
carbonation
was
a
bit
lower
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
nice
for
the
style
though
not
as
bright
and
smooth
as
some
other
witbiers
i
have
had
lemony
color
with
a
murk
that
gives
it
an
orange
hue
thick
tight
white
light
candy
with
a
lemony
fruit
and
hop
taste
is
a
light
belgian
sugar
cane
sweet
lemon
hop
strong
coriandar
light
yeast
wheat
and
soapiness
great
wit
curious
to
know
that
the
other
version
tastes
like
drinkability
this
is
very
good
its
light
creamy
tastes
good
and
is
very
smooth
going
down
one
of
the
best
witbiers
out
there
this
one
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
is
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
all
in
all
a
superb
and
refreshing
witbier
discovered
at
the
steelgarrden
in
bethlehem
pa
this
poured
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
whispy
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
fruitylemon
wheat
and
vanilla
the
taste
is
wheat
and
mellon
and
sweet
clove
i
pick
up
some
orange
and
theres
a
bit
of
malt
floating
around
in
the
back
fair
drinkability
full
feel
with
great
carbonation
not
quite
up
my
alley
as
whiteswits
go
but
nothing
to
sneeze
at
pretty
good
i
am
a
regular
hoegaarden
drinker
and
this
was
my
first
shot
at
this
amazing
white
belgian
beer
they
served
it
from
the
bottle
in
a
leffe
glass
it
was
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
was
conquered
by
the
amazing
freshness
of
the
first
tastes
i
have
tasted
many
a
white
beers
but
this
one
was
truly
exceptional
i
wanted
to
have
a
second
glass
but
they
had
served
me
their
last
bottle
i
have
to
admit
that
i
was
disappointed
this
beer
is
truly
outstanding
and
if
you
are
a
white
beer
lover
you
have
got
to
try
it
d
it
was
a
very
good
witbier
smooth
light
bodied
and
low
abv
make
it
a
great
summer
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
bright
but
wonderfully
cloudy
light
gold
with
a
fine
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
floral
yeasts
and
light
malt
the
taste
is
grassy
with
a
bit
of
yeast
and
sugar
in
the
finish
the
feel
is
light
and
very
dry
this
is
a
very
good
wit
that
has
a
bit
of
a
different
twist
to
the
taste
a
cloudy
pale
orange
body
w
a
good
head
that
left
a
lace
ring
down
the
glass
a
sharp
citric
smell
along
with
hints
or
lemon
tea
leaf
i
think
and
spices
has
that
familiar
quasisoapy
smell
some
wits
do
lightbodied
and
very
smooth
the
spices
and
citric
notes
are
blended
perfectly
for
a
great
taste
w
each
noticable
beer
floats
down
the
mouth
w
a
slight
prickle
of
sourness
on
the
backend
but
is
also
a
little
sweet
as
you
drink
it
this
beer
is
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
night
and
i
could
keep
drinking
this
all
the
time
d
six
pack
worthy
by
all
means
and
a
great
beer
to
beat
the
heat
nicely
fit
per
style
and
quenches
the
thirst
goes
down
really
nice
texture
is
just
right
not
prickly
with
carbonation
but
zings
a
bit
on
the
tongue
from
the
spices
again
only
a
slight
overhanging
lemoniness
keeps
this
from
being
downright
perfect
this
beer
is
great
it
is
definitely
a
beer
that
quenches
your
thirst
and
makes
you
want
another
very
quaffable
and
ill
be
having

lightbodied
and
refreshing
some
banana
lemon
and
a
touch
of
spice
come
out
in
the
flavor
a
good
beer
the
flavors
seem
to
mix
well
no
true
one
dominant
flavor
perhaps
a
tad
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
but
nothing
major
this
was
the
first
of
a
six
variety
pack
i
purchased
from
st
bernardus
and
i
am
pleased
with
this
one
i
look
forward
to
the
other
5
i
enjoyed
this
witbier
from
st
bernardus
quite
a
bit
easy
to
drink
and
very
nice
this
time
of
year
d
high
one
of
my
favs
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
impressive
head
nose
is
citrus
and
spice
taste
is
tart
and
spicy
very
impressive
and
very
drinkable
a
world
class
wheat
beer
sorry
i
should
say
wit
drinkability
its
nice
certainly
heavier
and
much
fuller
than
id
ever
expected
but
still
overall
nice
aroma
was
of
citrus
spice
clove
coriander
fruit
taste
was
yeast
citrus
apple
and
lots
of
spiciness
mouthfeel
was
good
carbonation
was
balanced
well
with
a
light
body
yet
the
beer
felt
solid
not
watery
there
was
no
bitter
finish
that
i
have
been
accustomed
to
from
recent
beer
tasting
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
to
start
the
night
with
the
mouthfeel
remains
creamy
despite
being
very
light
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
saves
this
from
being
too
light
and
propels
the
flavors
highly
drinkable
a
shame
this
isnt
cheaper
and
available
by
the
six
pack
great
with
salad
such
a
well
balanced
wit
beer
a
bit
of
orange
in
nose
and
taste
medium
body
from
the
wheat
coriander
is
very
well
integrated
into
flavor
not
overwhelming
like
most
versions
a
lot
better
mouthfeel
and
flavor
than
hoegarrden
very
drinkable
pours
a
nice
yellowcloudy
white
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
that
fades
quickly
nose
is
spice
and
wheat
belgian
yeast
taste
is
the
same
belgian
yeast
spice
wheat
and
some
alcohol
some
light
fruits
in
there
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
maybe
a
touch
thick
drinkability
is
pretty
good
but
there
is
a
bigger
alcohol
presence
in
this
than
i
expectprefer
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
one
i
am
sure
to
revisit
on
the
occasion
i
crave
a
good
wit
drinks
pretty
easy
a
nice
summer
time
quencher
but
give
me
the
old
celis
white
from
texas
any
day
i
took
great
care
with
this
one
so
i
dont
think
this
suffered
on
my
end
expected
more
ovr
close
to
perfect
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
some
fruity
yeast
esters
it
appears
dry
with
some
light
earthy
notes
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
wheat
malt
flavor
thats
quite
dry
yet
fruity
it
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
with
some
citrus
zest
this
is
a
very
earthyyeasty
brew
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
it
is
a
mediumfull
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
wit
everything
these
guys
brew
up
is
world
class
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
well
rounded
a
fullbodied
bready
and
chewy
beer
that
tasted
initially
of
banana
and
clove
and
a
bit
of
nutty
brown
sugar
all
that
yeasty
goodness
is
complimented
by
the
clove
and
coriander
and
spices
and
the
beer
finishes
very
crisply
and
refreshingly
perhaps
the
best
example
of
the
style
ive
tried
so
far
the
feel
of
the
drink
is
marvelously
soft
and
rolls
across
the
tongue
great
drinkability
fans
of
the
style
should
have
nothing
to
complain
about
here
dgreat
taste
and
mouth
feel
very
light
very
drinkable
d
very
high
unfortunately
this
is
pretty
pricey
so
i
will
have
to
limit
myself
a
creamy
and
bubbly
head
rests
on
top
this
morning
sunrise
colored
beer
body
is
mildly
cloudy
its
a
soft
beer
to
the
nose
and
palate
spices
are
minor
and
melded
in
nicely
to
the
fruity
taste
of
orange
and
pear
hints
of
yeast
too
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
a
good
choice
for
a
warm
summer
day
overall
not
nearly
as
good
as
i
was
hoping
or
expecting
d
this
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
i
will
enjoy
this
in
the
future
and
definitely
recommend
it
d
nice
complex
yeasty
white
ale
i
plan
on
having
in
the
future
d
although
refreshing
its
not
exactly
what
comes
to
mind
when
i
think
of
a
witbier
in
fact
its
a
pretty
full
flavored
and
a
little
intense
considering
most
in
the
style
a
nice
beer
to
have
now
and
again
but
too
difficult
and
pricey
for
me
to
session
man
what
a
great
easy
drinking
beer
dnice
drinker
the
big
head
on
the
pour
set
things
back
a
little
bit
i
like
the
fact
it
is
low
on
the
spices
the
yeasty
notes
a
bit
much
however
and
personally
i
would
not
rate
this
anywhere
near
the
top
of
my
list
of
favorite
whits
it
is
good
though
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
20
2008
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
orange
with
a
fingerthick
white
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
aroma
was
yeast
malt
and
spicy
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
almost
sparkling
the
flavour
was
wheat
yeast
and
some
sweet
malty
tones
i
love
the
irony
that
from
a
distance
this
label
vaguely
resembles
a
silver
coors
bottle
anyways
not
much
head
retention
but
the
body
is
still
a
nice
hazy
yellow
once
the
yeast
gets
dumped
in
i
actually
found
a
big
difference
in
flavor
and
aroma
in
a
good
way
by
adding
the
yeast
here
the
fruit
flavors
of
orange
peach
and
apricot
that
dominate
the
got
richer
and
the
spicy
aroma
grew
with
more
earthy
notes
overall
this
wit
is
on
the
thicker
juicier
side
of
the
style
as
opposed
to
lighter
crisper
drinking
ones
but
its
still
a
very
fine
beer
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
tasting
but
still
rather
refreshing
witbier
highly
recommended
this
is
a
pretty
traditional
witbier
if
you
enjoy
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
nice
cloudy
muddy
yellow
almost
a
light
brackish
color
with
a
full
white
soapy
head
that
does
retain
the
smell
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
the
style
clove
berry
apple
rind
coriander
yeast
the
taste
is
all
of
the
above
but
quite
subdued
there
is
a
slight
bubblegummy
taste
and
some
pepperishness
in
the
finish
this
is
very
refreshing
light
bodied
somewhat
watery
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
fine
representation
of
the
style
lchaim
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
yielding
a
nice
two
fingers
worth
of
head
and
looked
a
cloudy
applesauce
yellow
color
not
a
strong
aroma
to
it
so
i
had
a
hard
time
discerning
the
different
smells
mild
tasting
and
easy
drinking
with
lots
of
banana
bread
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
it
out
not
an
extreme
witbier
but
well
done
it
has
a
pretty
light
feel
in
the
mouth
and
would
certainly
be
nice
on
a
sunny
day
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
id
drink
it
again
but
probably
wont
seek
it
out
easy
to
put
down
but
perhaps
the
combination
of
my
own
taste
and
not
being
as
fresh
as
it
should
be
as
in
drinking
it
in
belgium
it
is
not
something
i
will
seek
again
overall
not
really
too
sure
where
i
stand
on
this
one
the
heavy
orange
flavor
is
almost
a
distraction
and
in
my
opinion
compromises
the
other
flavors
not
bad
but
not
great
all
in
all
lush
and
delicious
one
of
my
favorites
theres
a
nice
amount
of
spice
and
richness
full
but
not
heavy
love
the
acid
finish
refreshing
drink
for
a
patio
the
aroma
was
yeasty
bananas
coriander
orange
peel
and
pepper
the
taste
was
ridiculously
good
it
yeasty
wheaty
and
spicy
it
was
moderately
carbonated
and
left
a
yeast
and
peel
taste
in
the
mouth
it
tingled
the
throat
on
the
way
down
and
i
wanted
to
savor
it
more
than
i
was
allowed
wicked
solid
beer
d
by
far
one
of
the
best
wits
ive
ever
had
nicely
balanced
and
complex
not
to
mention
tasty
this
is
a
definite
reco
standup
job
drinkability
is
superb
i
found
myself
with
an
empty
glass
before
i
knew
it
on
two
different
occasions
with
this
stuff
make
sure
to
have
several
on
hand
when
you
break
out
this
rare
and
wonderful
treat
i
had
forgotten
how
much
i
enjoy
a
good
witbier
with
nothing
decent
nearby
a
fantastic
version
of
the
style
everyone
loves
or
should
love
its
not
offensive
but
considering
the
source
im
very
disappointed
might
try
again
if
im
convinced
later
that
this
was
just
a
bad
batch
i
ordered
it
with
pizza
one
night
and
really
wanted
to
savor
it
bit
it
is
so
smooth
and
refreshing
that
i
finished
long
before
the
pizza
and
had
to
order
a
second
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers
that
i
have
had
and
order
it
or
buy
it
when
possible
its
impressive
that
the
makers
of
one
of
the
finest
quadrupels
in
the
world
can
also
crank
out
a
refreshing
beer
like
this
its
definitely
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
available
edit
also
had
the
pierre
celis
signature
750
ml
any
difference
is
not
significant
in
my
mind
the
downside
is
how
hard
it
is
to
evenly
distribute
the
sediment
still
a
lovely
beer
d
goes
down
easy
not
as
flavorfulbold
as
other
wits
i
have
had
but
tasty
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
unreally
smooth
from
the
wheat
a
bit
too
fullflavored
to
be
supremely
drinkable
like
some
of
the
lighter
versions
of
the
style
out
there
but
this
is
quite
easily
the
best
as
far
as
overall
quality
overall
an
excellent
witbier
from
the
consistent
st
bernardus
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
with
a
sticky
foamy
offwhite
head
a
bit
smoother
than
the
comparable
but
somewhat
inferior
hoegaarden
a
little
more
citrus
taste
than
most
belgian
wheat
beers
but
very
well
balanced
with
the
full
robust
wheat
flavor
definately
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
get
a
case
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
whiteorange
typical
white
beer
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
holds
nicely
leaving
respectable
amounts
of
lace
the
smell
is
bready
with
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
tart
up
front
with
more
citrus
and
spicy
notes
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
not
quite
a
chewey
as
an
allagash
white
overall
this
is
a
great
thirst
quenching
beer
the
spicy
notes
are
enjoyable
as
well
the
biggest
detraction
is
the
body
i
could
use
a
bit
more
chewiness
also
i
enjoy
a
bit
more
floral
notes
but
this
is
still
a
fantastic
beer
i
compare
it
to
allagash
white
my
ideal
beer
in
this
style
but
it
would
be
hard
to
find
another
one
in
the
style
that
is
this
good
d
very
very
drinkable
excellent
refreshing
summer
beer
the
best
wit
ive
had
to
date
st
bernardus
make
some
consistently
quality
brews
ive
been
meaning
to
grab
a
4pack
of
these
for
a
while
but
the
price
tag
always
deterred
me
to
an
extent
lets
see
if
its
worth
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
with
a
perfect
fluffy
white
head
that
peaks
well
above
the
rim
of
my
pilsner
glass
but
doesnt
roll
over
smells
of
tangy
fruits
mixed
with
malts
cloves
and
a
creamy
sweetness
tastes
of
bananas
and
apples
with
a
slight
tangy
orange
peel
essence
left
on
the
palate
highly
drinkable
yet
tasty
at
the
same
time
well
worth
the
price
milky
turbid
peachy
color
with
a
fuzzy
white
head
aroma
of
yeast
and
hint
of
lemon
flavor
of
yeast
tart
wheat
lemom
zest
faint
coriander
and
bubblegum
cloves
lighttomedium
body
with
an
acidic
quenchy
finish
pretty
solid
example
not
too
much
coriander
or
fuller
bodied
like
many
american
versions
yet
i
must
say
that
im
not
any
more
enthused
than
with
most
other
wit
beers
worth
their
salt
what
a
great
beer
from
a
great
and
pioneering
brewer
thanks
pierre
very
hazy
straw
with
a
white
head
that
holds
fairly
well
and
leaves
a
good
bit
of
lace
for
a
wit
nose
is
nice
and
tart
and
tangy
with
wheat
apple
citrus
and
some
sweetness
coming
through
taste
is
very
similar
to
what
the
nose
sugggested
and
well
balanced
orange
and
clove
are
very
very
understated
compared
to
other
wits
ive
had
but
this
is
more
than
pleasant
and
the
flavors
that
come
through
are
wonderful
apple
lemon
bubblegum
wheat
cotton
candy
seems
nice
and
light
yet
maintains
a
medium
body
and
has
a
great
long
finish
what
a
pleasure
i
cant
wait
to
have
a
few
more
of
these
when
the
weather
warms
up
this
beer
is
really
what
i
would
expect
a
good
thirstquenching
witbier
to
be
out
of
all
the
witbiers
ive
tried
so
far
this
one
may
be
my
favorite
as
far
as
flavor
in
the
glass
it
has
a
very
cloudy
light
amber
color
with
almost
no
head
it
has
a
more
subtle
nose
than
other
witbiers
with
hints
of
apricot
and
orange
scents
however
in
this
case
the
aroma
does
not
explain
the
taste
rather
it
has
a
full
body
and
a
strong
yeasty
citrus
flavor
with
a
smooth
creamy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
to
prickle
across
your
tongue
although
it
has
a
low
alcohol
content
it
retains
that
nice
alcohol
flush
at
the
end
my
husband
described
this
one
as
blue
moon
on
steroids
although
i
thought
this
beer
was
delicious
the
creaminess
was
a
little
overwhelming
and
id
probably
only
drink
one
in
an
evening
appearance
is
murky
orange
with
a
big
white
head
the
aroma
is
mainly
fruitycitrus
nice
fruity
flavor
maybe
a
little
banana
apricot
and
lemon
pretty
acidic
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
also
quite
yeasty
and
quite
carbonated
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
soft
i
wouldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
thes
but
i
would
savor
one
or
two
on
a
hot
texas
evening
great
brew
something
missing
from
my
universe
is
back
as
usual
st
bernardus
outdoes
itself
it
has
the
typically
witbier
cloudiness
with
a
dark
amber
tone
theres
a
strong
smell
of
vanilla
a
factor
that
carries
over
to
the
taste
this
style
of
beer
is
always
pretty
drinkable
though
its
sweeter
than
what
i
normally
go
after
nonetheless
its
still
an
excellent
beer
excellent
taste
is
spicy
of
the
yeast
a
great
vanilla
taste
that
adds
a
great
twist
to
the
beer
the
wheat
is
grainy
like
raw
grain
bit
husky
bit
straw
bit
oatmeal
cookies
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
tart
but
not
sour
all
tastes
are
very
mild
and
the
beer
is
very
well
drinkable
very
good
witbier
from
the
man
who
virtually
invented
the
modern
style
quite
a
bit
different
than
both
hoegarden
and
celis
white
but
very
tasty
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
stay
around
long
at
all
nose
is
a
touch
of
orange
with
that
hearty
witbier
fragrance
and
some
yeast
thrown
in
the
mix
flavor
is
great
and
thick
with
a
heavy
citrusorange
flavor
that
has
a
strong
touch
of
spice
there
as
well
feel
is
nice
with
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
way
too
drinkable
i
want
to
be
able
to
sip
and
savor
this
one
but
it
is
so
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
that
its
easy
to
just
go
through
one
extremely
quickly
a
pleasant
brew
that
is
worth
a
try
light
and
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
nice
summer
beer
a
good
whit
just
a
bit
to
heavy
on
the
lemon
this
beauty
poured
into
my
mug
with
a
fantastic
foamy
head
lovely
yeast
floating
down
through
the
beer
tons
of
yeasty
aromas
some
bitter
citrus
hay
floral
scents
the
flavors
pop
in
the
mouth
orange
yeasts
coriander
lemons
grassy
notes
thick
delicious
mouthfeel
wow
this
is
the
best
witbier
ive
had
to
date
glad
i
have
another
to
enjoy
soon
saint
bernardus
witbeier
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
yellow
orange
with
a
creamy
lingering
head
the
aroma
is
coriander
with
sweet
light
malts
and
a
bit
of
slightly
chalky
yeast
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
sweet
with
a
great
balance
of
spices
and
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
beer
is
creamy
and
delicious
i
could
drink
this
all
night
aka
st
bernardus
wit
aroma
is
strong
and
maltywheaty
with
a
considerable
citrus
overtone
mainly
lemon
color
is
a
cloudy
almost
opaque
golden
amber
head
is
fairly
persistent
flavor
is
rich
and
wheaty
with
plenty
of
citrus
tang
and
a
piny
hops
undertone
it
feels
thick
and
smooth
and
leaves
a
lemony
aftertaste
especially
on
the
lips
notes
a
good
solid
wit
more
tart
than
most
with
less
banana
and
more
citrus
drinkability
extremely
sessionable
this
beer
got
better
and
better
as
it
went
d
i
think
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
wits
i
have
had
st
bernys
has
yet
to
let
me
down
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
some
brown
from
the
yeast
nice
carbonation
nice
small
creamy
white
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
follows
the
nose
is
malty
yeasty
slightly
spicy
floral
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
the
beginning
then
the
yeast
kicks
in
slight
spice
with
some
floral
tones
medium
body
very
drinkable
this
is
an
awesome
witbier
one
of
the
best
ive
had
to
date
this
is
all
topped
off
by
a
finish
that
is
long
thirst
quenching
and
quite
enjoyable
a
fine
offering
as
an
avid
follower
at
least
i
thought
i
was
of
the
st
bernardus
brewery
line
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
this
beer
on
the
shelf
at
a
local
jacksonville
wine
store
total
wine
abt
12
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
often
finds
its
way
into
my
regular
drinking
schedule
however
when
i
realized
st
b
purveyed
a
witbier
my
love
of
a
good
brewery
and
the
most
drinkable
beer
class
ive
come
across
were
combined
in
a
truly
fulfilling
brew
the
head
is
soft
and
flat
the
color
is
bright
blond
with
a
tinge
of
orange
and
the
feel
is
perfectly
effervescent
the
taste
is
refreshing
and
has
the
characteristic
coriander
and
orange
peel
flavor
of
many
witbiers
but
with
a
stronger
more
mature
aftertaste
than
hoegaarden
overall
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
belgium
beer
this
was
a
very
pleasant
beer
considering
i
only
had
5
sips
out
of
it
i
would
definetly
purchase
more
this
is
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
sailboat
on
a
sunday
afternoon
while
munching
on
white
chedder
and
crackers
but
that
was
how
i
enjoyed
it
anyway
overall
a
very
enjoyable
drink
i
still
prefer
the
greater
heft
of
a
weisen
but
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
which
would
be
great
for
hot
weather
applications
probably
not
a
bad
way
to
introduce
someone
to
the
wheat
end
of
the
beer
spectrum
wither
overall
impression
i
was
really
hoping
for
the
lactic
twang
that
celis
white
used
to
have
unfair
as
this
is
a
completely
different
beer
but
still
i
was
hoping
for
some
coriander
too
i
guess
my
expectations
let
me
down
much
more
than
this
beer
did
its
soft
subtle
thirst
quenching
and
good
i
practically
inhaled
the
whole
glass
definite
belgian
quality
to
it
i
guess
its
the
yeast
profile
solid
summer
beer
definite
session
potential
im
seeing
a
couple
bottles
in
a
picnic
basket
in
my
future
o
easy
and
enjoyable
to
drink
all
and
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
the
price
and
my
inflated
expectation
that
this
is
the
best
witbier
ever
left
me
wanting
wish
this
was
available
in
6
packs
instead
of
hoegaarden
pale
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
big
2
to
3
finger
head
to
start
drops
slowly
to
a
fine
bubbled
14
inch
white
cap
that
leaves
behind
fingers
of
lacing
smell
of
lemon
bananna
and
and
bready
yeast
tones
i
dont
pick
up
much
spice
in
the
smell
very
nice
and
clean
smelling
taste
follows
suit
somehow
it
is
mild
but
bold
all
the
taste
you
would
want
in
a
wit
but
not
overpowering
in
any
way
very
flavorful
some
mild
spicing
shows
up
in
the
taste
light
bodied
and
full
of
carbonation
but
just
the
right
amount
to
give
it
life
without
becoming
obtrusive
what
else
would
you
expect
a
great
beer
that
has
to
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
i
have
had
this
one
on
tap
a
few
times
at
the
bier
garden
in
portsmouth
va
and
never
wanted
to
take
enough
time
from
my
pure
enjoyment
to
make
notes
for
a
review
had
the
bottled
version
tonight
and
heres
the
review
great
wit
this
is
the
standard
that
i
would
measure
other
witbiers
against
pours
a
cloudy
dull
color
very
dense
with
a
huge
carbonated
white
head
on
a
hard
pour
that
very
slowly
melts
down
to
a
small
head
the
wheat
flavor
predominates
with
some
citrus
lemon
and
spiciness
mostly
pepper
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
rich
and
drinkability
is
great
this
is
one
to
savor
or
to
have
with
food
or
for
mass
consumption
i
would
still
have
to
drink
it
slow
to
enjoy
every
bit
of
the
flavor
a
definite
winner
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
witbiers
that
i
have
ever
had
this
could
have
been
a
regular
part
of
my
regular
beer
rotation
if
i
were
able
to
purchase
it
in
the
state
rumor
has
it
that
it
may
be
sold
here
by
the
end
of
the
year
i
can
only
hope
that
this
is
true
d
a
wonderful
witbier
this
is
normally
not
my
style
by
any
means
but
this
is
really
worth
a
try
it
has
made
other
witbiers
i
have
had
seem
almost
amateurish
light
and
refreshing
this
is
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
to
pair
with
grilled
scallops
shrimp
and
other
types
of
lighter
sea
fare
on
draft
at
sunset
grill
in
allston
ma
pours
very
pale
and
cloudy
with
no
head
rich
wheaty
aroma
nice
wheat
flavour
that
gets
more
interesting
as
it
developes
this
one
started
off
not
very
strong
but
seems
to
grow
in
stature
as
it
goes
down
nice
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
filling
at
all
excellent
representation
of
style
and
one
of
the
best
witbiers
that
i
have
had
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
an
evening
drinkability
is
good
for
a
beer
this
bold
and
flavorful
the
concentration
doesnt
deter
from
the
drinkability
which
is
seldom
accomplished
this
is
a
wit
with
more
than
just
yeast
oranges
and
coriander
it
is
a
complex
brew
that
is
drinkable
and
enjoyable
by
all
cheers
drinkability
about
as
good
as
it
gets
for
a
wit
very
nice
dif
you
are
looking
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
the
world
this
is
a
must
try
the
trappists
can
pull
it
off
d
okay
not
terribly
worth
the
effort
if
you
are
a
fan
of
st
bernarduss
other
offerings
i
am
not
then
this
might
be
enjoyed
more
wish
this
was
a
little
more
readily
available
and
the
price
is
not
in
line
with
my
tendency
to
do
anything
but
sip
this
suberbly
drinkable
brew
overall
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
a
totally
classic
beer
and
a
great
sumemr
release
will
have
to
save
one
for
the
lawn
mow
tomorrow
this
is
supremely
drinkable
while
it
satisfies
the
tastebuds
its
understated
enough
that
you
can
really
throw
these
back
and
not
get
sick
of
them
its
very
light
and
thirst
quenching
yet
as
still
has
enough
abv
to
do
the
trick
this
is
a
very
well
done
witbier
perhaps
the
best
at
least
regarding
the
quenchablity
a
super
drinkable
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
growler
more
of
this
rather
than
about
two
more
swallows
best
and
most
refined
belgian
witbier
i
have
had
yet
an
extremely
desirable
beer
so
easy
to
drink
stunningly
crisp
on
the
palate
with
great
depth
of
character
stands
heads
and
shoulders
above
most
other
belgian
wits
and
stands
up
to
the
most
venerable
of
german
hefeweissbiers
highly
recommended
for
fans
of
wheat
beers
light
summery
beers
belgian
beer
fans
interested
in
the
lighter
styles
or
anyone
in
need
of
a
quenching
another
wonderful
beer
from
the
little
town
of
watou
a
witbier
with
character
the
right
one
when
in
the
hot
of
summer
you
want
something
fresh
to
pair
with
a
gouda
sandwich
d
this
beer
has
a
good
crisp
refreshing
flavor
and
a
nice
little
hop
taste
to
balance
it
but
it
is
very
filling
and
feels
like
a
meal
in
a
glass
drinkability
highly
refreshing
with
a
substantial
yet
not
overdone
flavor
profile
exceedingly
pleasant
in
the
nose
smell
is
really
a
strong
attribute
overall
another
fine
beer
from
st
bernys
drinkability
easy
to
drink
but
also
complex
and
tasty
i
just
had
some
chili
and
this
was
an
odd
choice
afterwards
but
it
really
cleaned
up
the
palette
and
made
the
meal
that
much
more
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
flat
save
the
mineral
astringency
i
found
this
beer
almost
undrinkable
and
wit
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
it
was
interesting
but
not
pleasant
im
wondering
if
we
got
a
bad
bottle
but
the
freshness
date
said
it
was
good
for
a
few
more
months
guess
im
just
not
into
this
still
you
could
drink
it
all
night
pours
out
like
a
cloudy
melted
creamsicle
head
is
small
and
disappears
quickly
lots
of
protein
chunks
the
yeast
stands
out
in
the
nose
but
there
isnt
much
spicing
i
find
i
get
some
stone
fruits
and
pale
wheat
flavor
is
of
a
dino
flinstone
vitamin
with
a
saltymineraly
finish
coriander
is
around
there
somewhere
but
the
chewable
vitamin
overtakes
everything
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
and
rather
flat
mouthfeel
is
kind
of
slick
from
the
soft
tasting
and
mineraly
water
drain
pour
drinkabilityi
could
drink
this
all
day
and
still
have
wine
with
dinner
pours
a
cloudy
whitelight
golden
with
just
an
okay
head
the
smell
has
light
clove
banana
and
bubblegum
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
with
the
addition
of
some
aapple
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
quite
spritzy
but
it
works
with
the
style
to
add
refreshment
quite
drinkable
but
this
one
didnt
blow
me
way
its
obviously
well
constructed
but
nothing
made
me
stand
up
and
take
notice
sweet
for
a
witbier
certainly
not
dry
it
tastes
like
most
witbiers
i
know
but
feels
much
more
robust
the
flavors
seem
poorly
defined
and
the
whole
experience
a
little
murky
theres
some
spice
in
there
and
hop
flavor
with
a
little
bitterness
to
keep
things
coralled
some
light
fruit
shows
up
along
with
some
definite
wheatiness
but
i
cant
help
but
think
ho
hum
poured
out
an
interesting
color
i
have
not
seen
before
the
color
is
a
dark
yellow
with
almost
a
greenish
hue
to
it
the
head
was
average
leaving
traces
of
lacing
as
it
reduced
the
aroma
has
an
acidic
spicey
smell
very
slight
bitterness
on
the
finish
light
bodied
with
a
refreshing
and
extremley
drinkable
quality
a
sweet
malt
along
with
almost
a
sour
feel
this
is
not
like
an
other
witbier
ive
ever
had
a
very
quick
and
passsing
slight
phenol
taste
hints
of
citrus
with
generous
amounts
of
spice
a
very
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
i
could
drink
these
all
day
id
like
to
see
the
abv
highermaybe
around
like
7
or
8
has
a
rich
creamy
rolling
texture
i
found
this
beer
to
be
hard
to
review
for
some
reason
maybe
its
overwhelming
because
there
is
so
much
going
on
i
found
it
hard
to
make
out
the
spices
used
again
a
most
drinkable
wit
just
a
notch
above
my
previous
favorite
allagash
a
fantastic
witbier
and
worth
seeking
out
quite
complex
yet
still
delicate
it
is
a
little
steep
at
3
29
for
that
little
bottle
but
its
well
worth
it
i
feel
great
beer
and
highly
recommended
for
hot
nights
outside
d
a
nice
summer
brew
perhaps
more
flavor
would
be
a
good
thing
st
bernardus
witbier
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
from
an
11
2
ounce
brown
bottle
the
aroma
is
quite
good
citrus
is
most
noticeable
the
taste
is
a
bit
different
than
most
wits
that
ive
had
in
that
it
seems
to
me
that
i
can
taste
candy
sugar
which
is
fairly
typical
in
belgians
but
not
so
much
in
wits
although
i
could
be
mistaken
about
the
flavor
the
citrus
is
noticeable
but
not
nearly
as
strong
in
the
flavor
as
in
the
aroma
coriander
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
finishes
dry
for
some
reason
when
im
sipping
it
i
keep
thinking
its
going
to
have
a
sweet
finish
but
it
doesnt
definitely
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
its
interesting
i
just
had
and
reviewed
a
bells
winter
white
ale
right
before
this
and
the
comparison
was
intriguing
while
that
one
was
certainly
tasty
and
drinkable
it
wasnt
nearly
as
refined
and
well
elegant
as
this
one
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most
expertly
crafted
wits
ive
come
across
in
a
long
time
but
than
again
what
do
you
expect
from
a
brewery
that
is
known
for
making
exceptional
and
authentic
belgian
ales
highly
recommended
at
nearly
3
dollars
a
bottle
this
is
a
bit
pricey
for
everyday
beer
but
that
is
exactly
what
this
should
be
an
everyday
beer
and
a
staple
in
every
fridge
creamy
but
still
light
carbonation
wasnt
a
major
issue
at
all
i
could
totally
put
down
a
4
pack
if
only
it
werent
so
damn
pricey
overall
i
stated
some
time
ago
that
i
didnt
see
the
point
in
witbiers
beers
like
hoegaarden
and
now
st
bernardus
have
helped
me
to
see
the
light
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
extremely
flavorful
and
drinkable
wit
but
13
994
pack
yow
sticker
shock
i
guess
i
shall
continue
to
quest
for
an
affordable
good
wit
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
witbier
opinion
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
wit
beers
but
this
is
no
doubt
the
best
one
that
i
have
tried
to
date
i
think
that
this
beer
is
probably
as
good
as
you
can
get
for
this
style
i
wouldnt
suggest
any
improvements
or
say
that
it
had
any
flaws
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
wit
and
this
beer
is
available
this
would
be
my
choice
d
tasty
and
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
another
treat
from
st
bernardus
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
but
decent
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
and
sour

also
grainy
the
taste
is
sweet
and
a
bit
malty
the
sourness
is
noticeable
the
mouthfeel
is
bright
and
medium
bodied
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
is
quite
drinkable

probably
the
most
opaque
witbier
ive
had
smells
citrusy
and
earthy
tastes
citrusy
and
earthy
too
but
these
flavors
are
somewhat
muted
by
the
yeastiness
of
the
beer
light
closer
to
medium
bodied
because
of
the
yeast
carbonation
while
present
is
also
muted
due
to
the
yeastiness
not

what
to
make
of
this
one
i

itd
be
better
if
it
had

i

to
try
some
in

i
really
love
this
beer
the

amazing
drinkability
is

this
is
a
very
nice
example
of
a
wit
that
does
not

cost
and
availability
would
be
the
only

have
this
as

i
found
this

to

for
the
most

tasteless
the

is
very
thin

spices

hops
hardly

really

ended

this

i
remember
asking
the

about
it

lets
forget
about
the
grey
lady
and
wish
everyone
around
you
a
witbierday
this
is
hopelessly
underrated
that
or
the
recipe
has
changed
a
lot
over
time
because
this
is
a
wonderful
belgian
wit
funky
as
heck
almost
saison
even
a
touch
of
brett
almost
in
the
yeast
profile
which
makes
the
beer
but
lemongrass
and
lemon
verbena
radiate
in
the
nose
and
the
taste
too
faint
copper
hue
to
this
pale
yellow
brew
head
is
short
lived
but
my
pint
glass
might
be
a
little
greasy
the
flavor
is
great
bright
wheat
malt
base
and
a
fantastic
herbal
character
both
hoppy
and
grassy
and
botanical
like
its
super
carbonated
huge
bubbles
explode
on
the
tongue
and
the
finish
is
about
as
dry
as
you
can
get
im
not
sure
what
more
people
were
looking
for
in
this
maybe
body
its
really
light
so
easy
down
as
to
be
easier
to
drink
than
water
on
a
hot
day
the
low
abv
makes
this
okay
though
or
at
least
it
does
for
me
the
infinite
session
beer
flavorful
and
dynamic
expressive
and
well
crafted
cisco
has
always
impressed
me
everything
i
taste
from
them
reaffirms
my
admiration
for
them
this
is
very
unique
as
wits
go
and
positively
delicious
a
surprising
gem
i
enjoyed
this
one
very
much
especially
considering
the
low
ratings
it
receives

and
overall
is
a

not
a

very
subtle

but
very
refreshing
and
easydrinking
a
pleasant

brew
to
be
sure
a
little
more
citrus
than
i
prefer
but
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
beer
becomes
floral
late
kinda
flat
its
got
a
little
more
spritz
than
crispness
but
it
does
have
a
nice
running
dryness
with
a
spicy
bite
on
the
tongue
and
its
fairly
smooth
as
well
o
interesting
combination
of
the
herbal
tea
lemon
and
the
fruity
citrus
the
aroma
is
quite
nice
that
leads
into
a
bit
underwhelming
taste
but
still
a
nice
beer
very
zesty
and
refreshing
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
more
if
the
spices
and
fruit
were
a
bit
more
powerful
i
liked
it
im
glad
i
tired
it
but
i
regret
that
i
got
an
entire
sixpack
just
to
say
it
again
pour
this
one
into
a
glass
o
this
is
not
a
bad
witbier
but
it
is
a
bit
unbalanced
and
onedimensional
there
are
definitely
better
out
there
but
this
one
should
not
be
entirely
avoided
a
beautiful
pale
pour
with
a
small
fizzy
head
and
cloudy
body
great
lacing
aroma
is
clean
with
notes
of
hay
celery
and
magnolia
seed
lemon
pledge
some
graininess
and
belgian
funk
from
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
light
and
somewhat
tart
flavor
is
quite
malty
with
grain
being
the
most
predominant
floral
hops
finish
clean
its
a
very
nice
beer
refreshing
and
complex
overall
this
is
an
interesting
and
funky
wit
that
has
a
lot
of
merits
o
definitely
not
a
favorite
in
the
belgian
wit
category
the
sourness
of
the
beer
was
unpleasant
and
seemed
to
put
the
beer
half
way
on
the
path
to
a
berliner
weisse
sourness
has
a
place
just
not
in
witbier
there
some
uniqueness
to
grey
lady
its
a
more
savory
taste
with
exotic
spice
combinations
to
give
the
beer
an
identity
however
i
wish
that
it
remained
breadier
and
creamier
later
in
the
session
before
falling
apart
light
golden
pour
with
just
a
touch
of
haze
massive
head
with
a
lacing
that
retains
very
well
light
nose
of
coriander
belgian
yeast
and
a
sweet
fruity
spiciness
with
lemon
notes
very
light
medium
bodied
with
an
attempt
to
be
slick
over
a
normal
level
of
carbonation
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
weak
but
nice
it
begins
with
a
blend
of
light
spice
that
progresses
to
light
coriander
in
the
middle
the
citric
lemon
and
wheat
characteristics
are
evident
the
finish
is
crisp
with
lingering
notes
of
spice
and
citrus
a
nice
offering
for
a
hot
day
session
a
bit
more
body
and
flavor
intensity
would
make
this
one
outstanding
o
where
many
witbiers
can
be
understated
in
their
complexity
this
one
is
brash
and
bold
with
its
flavor
additions
it
certainly
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
pack
an
excellent
beach
beer
on
a
sunny
summer
day
as
beers
go
im
sure
this
one
is
appealing
to
many
but
for
my
own
personal
tastes
this
one
is
not
for
me
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
mild
with
some
malt
spice
and
slight
citrus
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
lemon
zest
spice
and
tea
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
some
interesting
flavors
and
a
fairly
subdued
aroma
until
the
beer
warms
up
just
not
a
good
beer
at
all
very
light
yellow
in
color
almost
like
lemonade
the
smell
is
of
citrus
and
coriander
or
allspice
a
light
white
head
but
it
feels
very
bubbly
on
the
tongue
refreshing
with
a
slight
spiciness
a
really
nice
belgian
white
ill
definitely
enjoy
drinking
the
rest
of
the
samples
in
my
beer
of
the
month
club
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
obviously
a
wit
beer
a
sophisticated
blend
of
spices
very
light
on
the
palate
a
beer
meant
for
mass
consumption
on
a
hot
day
very
nice
o
an
above
average
wit
in
my
mind
and
i
could
drink
a
six
of
these
easily
aside
from
the
appearance
a
very
good
beer
the
loud
crack
evinced
yet
another
brimful
can
this
one
to
the
point
that
i
got
a
bit
of
a
spritz
the
lady
is
a
squirter
apparently
which
does
not
bother
me
plus
she
is
also
spicy
and
inviting
so
i
feel
like
a
good
time
is
upcoming
we
began
with
an
inverted
glug
to
measure
her
tolerance
and
i
found
out
that
she
does
not
necessarily
like
being
turned
upsidedown
unexpectedly
but
that
she
deals
with
it
nicely
the
massive
threeplus
fingers
of
dense
bonewhite
head
looked
like
meringue
atop
a
lemon
pie
i
was
so
envious
because
as
a
teenage
baker
i
could
never
get
my
meringue
right
man
this
stuf
looked
like
marshmallow
fluf
as
it
began
to
slowly
fall
before
initiating
my
final
pour
having
left
about
a
third
still
in
the
can
initially
i
gave
her
a
good
shake
to
really
stir
things
up
no
sense
in
leaving
anything
in
the
can
that
you
might
want
later
right
this
really
stirred
things
up
both
literally
and
figuratively
man
she
was
as
angry
as
the
hornets
nest
on
the
day
that
i
dang
near
put
my
hand
through
it
while
retrieving
a
frisbee
she
was
swatting
me
with
her
tail
and
threatening
to
conk
me
with
the
bottle
in
her
left
hand
color
was
a
hazy
sunshineyellow
srm

with
some
floaties
in
evidence
i
lifted
her
towards
me
and
inhaled
deeply
taking
in
her
spicy
clovelike
perfume
she
smelled
like
my
first
lover
an
older
patchouliwearing
hippie
following
a
grateful
dead
concert
on
city
island
in
harrisburg
pa
in
june
1983
shortly
before
i
left
for
boot
camp
she
smiled
at
my
recollection
and
threw
her
arms
around
me
allowing
and
enabling
me
to
uncouple
her
seashell
bra
which
i
kept
as
a
souvenir
dont
believe
me
see
my
facebook
picture
from
iron
hills
mahalo
apollo
release
party
when
i
wore
it
in
her
honor
ah
what
a
lady
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
the
style
usually
evinces
such
but
the
spices
were
just
about
right
said
as
i
toss
my
golden
locks
i
agree
with
an
earlier
reviewer
that
it
falls
short
of
hoegaarden
but
if
i
wanted
a
hoegaarden
then
i
would
have
purchased
one
wouldnt
i
that
is
a
non
sequitur
but
nor
have
i
reviewed
the
one
that
he
felt
was
overly
spiced
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
like
and
i
liked
this
beer
it
probably
would
not
measure
up
as
a
hula
in
the
coola
day
01
feb
annually
beer
because
it
is
more

to

really

you
ever

water
cold
water
sucks
for
that
purpose
fair
winds
and
following

my
grey
lady
ill
see
you
in
the
summer
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
its
a
very
simple
beer
extremely
refreshing
good
flavor
with
a
good
mouthfeel
it
may
be
lacking
in
complexity
and
it
certainly
doesnt
exhaust
the
style
but
it
really
does
hit
the
spot
ill
keep
drinking
this
as
long
as
they
keep
making
it
a
very
creative
witbier
different
from
what
i
had
tasted
so
far
it
cannot
be
more
refreshing
though
its
body
could
be
a
bit
bolder
i
had
this
for
the
other
day
and
i
was
quite
impressed
at
first
there
isnt
very
much
flavor
but
it
ends
on
a
very
nice
spicy
note
i
would
say
peppery
the
alcohol
flavor
is
well
masked
by
the
spices
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
extremely
spicy
but
to
my
pleasant
surprise
it
was
not
overwhelming
this
is
fruity
and
light
and
so
most
ba
people
arent
gonna
hype
it
but
its
really
quite
exquisitely
brewed
o
this
brew
needs
a
despicing
to
have
any
chance
to
go
anywhere
it
has
way
too
strong
of
clove
character
which
overpowers
all
the
other
possible
flavors
this
brew
may
have
the
coriander
is
also
too
strong
and
the
astringency
heightens
the
bitterness
and
pithiness
of
the
citrus
notes
not
a
good
beer
from
cisco
a
fairly
simple
but
quite
pleasant
witbier
it
isnt
the
most
attractive
beer
in
the
world
but
not
too
bad
straw
colored
with
little
head
but
fair
carbonation
the
rest
is
pretty
good
whats
particularly
interesting
about
this
beer
is
that
you
dont
get
a
big
hit
of
orange
or
coriander
like
many
wits
but
what
you
do
get
is
a
very
balanced
and
surprisingly
floral
beer
with
notes
of
peaches
particularly
in
the
aroma
tangerines
melon
and
even
a
bit
of
the
white
of
the
watermelon
with
a
finish
of
lemon
juice
in
water
it
is
a
bit
thin
in
body
but
overall
its
probably
underrated
nb
this
was
a
fairly
fresh
batchless
than
two
weeks
off
the
line
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
spiciness
maybe
ive
just
not
had
enough
of
the
style
but
this
seems
differently
spiced
and
i
commend
them
for
it
would
gladly
get
again
and
recommend
it
for
a
nice
summer
day
cheers

this
is

little
beer
here
spiced
well
as
it
doesnt
burn
me
out
i
gulped
and
gulped
this
one
until
i
was
looking
through
the
bottom
of
the
glass
before
i
knew
it
perfect
beer
for
the
upcoming
warm
months
that
is
both
tasty
and
refreshing
a
great
combo
o
i
was
worried
this
one
might
have
died
a
while
ago
since
its
over
six
months
old
but
there
are
no
signs
of
skunking
or
oxidation
its
just
an
overly
spiced
witbier
not
bad
but
not
great

im
actually
surprised
that
this
is
a
wit
it
smells
more
like
a
saison
taste
is
also
saison
like
quite
dry
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
not
perfectly
to
style
but
not
a
bad
offering
earns
points
for
the
novelty
a
fun
one
to
try
but
primarily
for
the
novelty
points
t
pretty
mild
taste
with
a
touch
of
citrus
zest
lemongrass
faint
lemon
juice
a
faint
wheat
tartness
mild
green
apple
and
some
grassy
hops
a
mild
biscuit
malt
backbone
holds
it
up
mouthfeel
is
definitely
a
bit
watered
down
but
has
some
tight
carbonation
that
makes
this
drinkable
like
crazy
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
has
its
imperfections
the
yeast
seems
to
be
the
best
part
its
fruity
and
offers
a
bubblegum
note
the
spices
are
absent
save
for
the
mild
coriander
there
are
better
witbiers
out
there
but
this
was
good
once
lighter
medium
body
decent
carbonation
a
little
watery
and
transparent
on
the
tongue
this
isnt
bad
but
theres
definitely
more
flavorful
and
expressive
examples
of
the
style
out
there
o
i
am
disappointed
beyond
belief
considering
the
premium
pricing
for
this
the
nose
was
nice
though
maybe
they
ought
to
go
into
candle
making
instead
of
beer
brewing
o
only
ok
not
their
best
nice
and
cloudy
presentation
with
a
quickly
disappearing
white
head
with
nice
lingering
lace
light
nose
with
a
bit
of
citrus
and
a
light
spice
character
this
beer
carries
the
familiar
light
and
refreshing
flavor
and
mouthfeel
but
is
a
little
lacking
on
the
expected
complexity
of
a
true
wit
overall
pretty
solid
witbier
i
am
just
not
drawn
to
it
but
i
do
like
it
and
could
have
this
again
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
lemonyellow
color
with
a
dense
foamy
white
head
the
nose
is
heavy
of
citrus
and
coriander
with
some
herbal
highlights
smooth
spicey
palate
with
a
lemony
backbone
coriander
on
the
palate
after
you
finish
with
a
slick
finish
overall
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
enjoyable
but
forgettable
strangely
drinkable
the
flavor
is
odd
different
from
other
wits
ive
had
very
easily
sessionable
and
thirst
quenching
in
warm
weather
falls
short
in
the
flavor
not
the
profile
but
the
potency
it
feels
a
little
watered
down
otherwise
quite
good
o
very
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
and
very
refreshing
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
and
a
really
good
one
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
this
one
is
almost
tasteless
it
is
refreshing
but
there
is
almost
nothing
to
say
about
the
flavor
d
this
is
a
pretty
standard
wit
which
is
to
say
that
it
is
lightly
spicy
drinkable
and
little
else
not
great
but
if
you
want
something
mild
and
inoffensive
it
would
work
citrusy
lemon
orange
zest
blend
noticeable
coriander
in
the
aroma
light
and
fresh
impression
taste
is
similar
citrusy
and
dry
crisp
and
lightly
tart
dry
wheaty
aftertaste
feel
is
slightly
watery
but
its
zesty
and
quenching
overall
enjoyable
and
something
id
seek
out
again
in
sixer
form
seems
tailor
made
for
warm
spring
and
summer
afternoons
a
correander
taste
was
definetly
noticable
o
this
is
one
of
those
beers
thats
not
bad
but
doesnt
quite
rise
above
the
fray
taste
is
noticeably
spicy
with
a
slight
lemon
tartness
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
that
is
light
bodied
but
has
plenty
of
complex
flavors
i
will
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
a
fun
springsummer
beer
from
cisco
overall
b
this
is
the
strangest
beer
ever
but
i
like
to
think
of
it
as
unique
even
though
i
usually
drink
barley
wines
quadrupels
and
imperial
stouts
this
lighter
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
because
it
also
has
so
much
flavor
it
tastes
like
tea
white
or
yellow
with
lemon
and
a
touch
of
honey
doesnt
taste
like
a
beer
at
all
light
pale
yellow
grey
color
has
undertones
of
coriander
malt
hay
and
caramel
earthyness
and
freshness
similar
to
french
verveine
tea
it
has
very
little
body
but
enough
maltyness
fruityness
and
texture
to
make
it
interesting
on
the
palate
o
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
theres
nothing
really
special
about
the
taste
but
it
would
make
for
a
nice
easy
drinking
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
found
on
cask
at
the
cask
republic
in
new
haven
ct
this
special
treat
was
actually
a
uniquely
dry
hopped
edition
featuring
centennial
hops
over
the
usual
grey
lady
and
the
results
were
quite
nice
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
big
white
bubbles
on
top
and
no
lace
the
nose
detects
a
polite
wheat
and
toffee
combo
covered
in
fruit
nougat
and
mild
citrus
hop
the
flavor
is
a
bit
odder
with
a
musty
more
herbal
hop
with
orange
tea
and
grassy
edges
the
hops
work
nicely
to
redefine
this
tried
and
true
blonde
it
definitely
grows
on
you
as
the
must
fades
and
more
lemony
ideas
emerge
its
mediumlight
bodied
with
typical
vague
carbonation
in
the
end
it
is
a
hit
well
done
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
am
attempting
to
expand
my
beer
palate
and
not
just
stick
to
one
style
i
will
definitely
look
out
for
more
beer
by
this
brewery
o
its
a
pretty
good
beer
good
ideas
in
there
but
its
just
not
quite
executed
well
enough
a
pretty
nice
witbier
altogether
i
would
like
to
see
some
more
apparent
spice
in
the
flavor
with
a
touch
less
of
the
sour
fruit
but
not
bad
i
could
definitely
power
through
a
few
of
these
during
a
hot
day
on
the
beach
six
months
from
now
but
right
now
its
not
a
great
choice
and
i
was
not
impressed
go
with
the
whales
tale
pale
ale
or
the
ipa
over
this
from
cisco
not
their
best
o
a
great
refreshing
beer
sessionable
over
all
not
that
impressed
o
cant
quite
wrap
my
head
around
this
one
the
aroma
was
very
interesting
and
inviting
only
to
be
let
down
by
that
odd
flavor
starting
to
really
think
i
got
a
bad
bottle
i
really
like
most
of
the
other
beers
ive
tried
from
cisco
will
try
again
when
its
back
in
stock
by
me
and
rereview
if
any
different
odoverall
i
believe
i
like
witbiers
more
than
the
regular
craft
beer
drinker
this
one
is
good
aside
from
the
initial
metallic
taste
i
am
not
extraordinarily
happy
with
my
10
6
pack
i
would
not
buy
this
ever
again
but
i
will
drink
all
six
of
these
without
much
complaint
aside
from
maybe
the
woods
series
from
cisco
i
find
their
beers
to
be
underwhelming
o
i
really
liked
the
beer
it
is
a
big
change
up
from
most
beers
i
try
which
are
usually
darker
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
i
could
see
myself
downing
a
lot
of
these
with
no
problem
even
while
reviewing
the
beer
it
has
barely
lasted
me
10
minutes
if
you
are
not
opposed
to
high
carbonation
and
strong
citrus
you
will
like
this
beer
o
cheap
crisp
refreshing
and
a
winner
good
stuff
to
beat
the
heat
a
better
than
average
wit
and
a
good
choice
for
a
muggy
boston
afternoon
nothing
remarkable
but
quite
drinkable
and
easy
d
sorry
cisco
but
something
about
this
one
was
a
bit
of
turnoff
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
or
even
welcome
again
in
the
future
seems
it
should
be
quaffable
but
given
the
odd
mix
of
flavors
it
just
isnt
this
one
misses
the
mark
slightly
in
several
areas
which
unfortunately
combines
for
a
large
very
refreshing
and
crisp
yet
with
some
complexity
as
well
really
love
the
cookielike
character
the
anise
gives
it
o
this
was
just
way
too
thin
for
my
liking
a
little
more
body
and
this
could
be
a
strong
offering
with
that
said
on
a
very
hot
summer
day
this
could
be
a
thirst
quencher
od
it
has
its
moments
with
taste
but
its
rather
bland
overall
the
mouthfeel
really
killed
it
for
me
not
a
huge
fan
of
dry
beers
but
this
one
was
just
odd
overall
picked
up
a
single
at
abes
this
beer
is
oddly
tart
and
based
off
the
huge
head
i
wonder
if
there
might
be
a
slight
infection
aside
from
the
toosharp
lemon
character
theres
a
distinct
wheat
dough
aroma
and
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
of
here
but
this
has
the
makings
of
a
nice
wit
overall
this
was
a
solid
beer
and
one
thats
easy
to
drink
in
the
warmer
months
worth
a
shot
hazy
yellow
with
a
large
amount
of
carbonation
big
bubbles
foam
up
the
sides
but
disappear
quickly
nose
is
yeasty
and
cereal
malts
grainy
and
bready
flavor
is
pale
cereal
malts
and
creamy
wheat
with
a
big
spicy
hop
and
yeast
character
finishes
with
the
spicy
notes
subdued
and
just
a
lemon
zesty
tingle
average
balance
of
wheat
yeast
and
hops
not
really
a
fan
i
guess
i
can
see
how
some
people
could
appreciate
this
beer
however
it
didnt
really
workout
for
me
the
beer
itself
resembled
soapy
foggy
mountain
dew
this
beer
was
refreshing
and
tastes
alright
on
a
warm
day
but
felt
watery
again
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
to
begin
with
but
was
overall
disappointed
i
think
the
appearance
of
the
beer
also
ruined
other
aspects
for
me
as
well
this
witbier
is
a
honey
golden
color
with
appreciable
notes
of
belgian
yeast
and
citrus
fruit
complimented
by
spices
such
as
coriander
and
ginger
theres
a
trace
of
grassy
hops
on
the
back
end
and
grey
lady
is
a
refreshing
well
balanced
ale
from
start
to
finish
at
4
5
abv
its
a
nice
session
beer
for
summer
o
really
far
too
light
to
me
not
enough
spicing
not
enough
citrus
feels
rather
watery
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
great
summer
beer
not
sure
if
i
will
get
more
because
there
are
cheaper
summer
beers
that
are
just
as
nice
but
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
citrus
o
refreshing
and
balanced
overall
not
a
lot
of
character
a
decent
light
body
with
good
lively
carbonatino
a
little
bit
of
a
sticky
finish
overall
this
one
is
unimpressive
the
flavors
and
aromas
seem
a
bit
off
id
say
this
is
one
that
could
be
passed
over
pretty
easily
clear
pale
gold
with
a
soapy
white
cap
decent
head
retention
just
a
couple
clumps
of
chunky
lacing
lemony
wheat
aroma
citrus
crackery
spicy
pear
grassy
low
bitterness
light
grassiness
less
lemon
than
expected
doughy
mild
spice
tastes
okay
but
a
little
thin
compared
to
the
aroma
the
body
suffered
somewhat
from
carbonation
that
was
quite
high
initially
but
felt
lifeless
once
it
quickly
degassed
medium
bodied
and
offdry
overall
it
was
okay
but
it
didnt
wow
me
pours
a
quite
bright
lemony
yellow
color
with
huge
cap
of
prickly
bubbly
white
head
that
lasts
and
lasts
scent
is
quite
pleasent
belgian
yeasts
at
the
front
with
lemon
and
watery
fruits
and
spice
first
sip
was
quite
a
palate
shocker
tart
sour
and
bitter
lemon
rind
dominate
with
lemon
scented
cleaner
astringency
whats
behind
it
isnt
much
better
as
it
tastes
like
musty
pond
water
after
your
palate
is
used
to
the
harsh
tones
body
is
uber
light
a
step
above
water
overly
active
carbonation
i
dont
know
whats
going
on
here
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
a
bottle
a
lovely
spring
day
i
was
pretty
excited
pour
had
plenty
of
head
but
that
went
away
real
fast
not
an
iota
of
lacing
to
be
seen
here
a
pretty
cloudy
lemonyellow
color
though
smelled
first
of
bananas
and
pears
digging
those
esters
but
the
taste
i
mean
of
course
it
should
be
sour
and
i
like
sour
things
but
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
else
going
on
there
definitely
overpowering
any
subtlety
on
my
tongue
pleasantly
carbonated
and
fun
to
drink
and
all
and
it
iisi
a
really
nice
day
out
but
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
lemon
lime
soda
beer
it
would
actually
make
a
very
nice
soda
but
that
is
the
whole
problem
here
too
thin
for
any
style
with
a
flavor
that
is
out
of
check
now
that
i
think
of
it
it
tastes
a
lot
like
baja
blast
an
exclusive
soda
to
taco
bell
a
northeast
witbier
eh
hazy
clouded
bright
yellow
sunshine
golden
with
a
bright
white
head
flowing
thick
leaves
behind
fine
even
lacing
down
the
sides
of
my
pint
glass
first
smell
i
can
tell
theres
citrus
peel
and
coriander
but
the
yeast
notes
override
the
spice
with
nuttybready
notes
from
their
house
yeast
let
me
try
my
first
swig
from
these
guys
like
a
spiced
citrus
coriander
smoothie
whats
going
on
is
there
cream
and
chammomile
in
this
it
tastes
like
i
added
heavy
cream
to
herbal
tea
wow
the
flavor
is
wilded
one
of
the
heaviest
citrusspicecreamy
texture
wits
ive
ever
come
across
it
lands
in
the
wtf
segment
of
my
palate
when
you
burp
have
people
stand
back
it
hits
with
citrus
fury
and
coriander
cantor
from
your
nares
and
stomach
whats
up
with
beer
labels
and
ugly
mermaids
ive
seen
a
couple
this
year
think
coronado
and
maybe
one
other
overall
its
like
a
coriandercream
basedcitrus
peel
smoothies
as
you
get
thru
each
sip
each
one
becomes
more
enjoyable
but
as
a
whole
from
the
years
of
drinking
different
witbiers
this
is
still
a
wtf
experience
o
its
decent
for
what
it
is
if
you
want
a
wit
id
recommend
you
try
it
plenty
of
better
beers
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
i
was
offered
it
again
poured
a
1
5
head
hazy
straw
yellow
in
color
smells
mildly
of
citrus
spice
and
malt
taste
is
even
milder
than
the
smell
but
continues
the
citrus
and
spice
almost
like
a
weak
herbal
tea
although
i
agree
with
last
word
on
the
side
label
that
its
quenching
thats
easy
to
say
when
youve
got
just
a
step
up
from
water
but
hey
at
least
the
grey
lady
wasnt
actually
grey
pours
a
fluffy
two
finger
white
head
this
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
of
lacing
only
kind
of
disappointing
smells
of
a
big
belgian
la
fin
du
monde
esque
clove
banana
more
ripe
fruit
pears
tastes
pepery
light
crystal
sweetness
some
banana
clove
cinnamon
maybe
thin
thin
bodied
medium
carbing
a
touch
of
lingering
hop
bitterness
overall
this
is
descent
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
nice
smell
and
good
taste
but
the
body
hurts
this
quite
a
bit
i
will
pick
this
up
again
on
a
hot
hot
summer
day
and
drink
ice
cold
1
89
a
single
d
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
these
all
night
very
sessionable
and
pretty
consistently
pleasant
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
tried
from
cisco
who
ive
heard
great
things
about
and
i
am
excited
to
try
more
soon
this
is
not
my
style
of
beer
but
then
again
this
is
not
my
style
of
brewery
12
bucks
for
a
6
pack
of
local
brew
says
it
all
this
beer
needs
to
stay
on
that
little
island
overall
a
citrusy
disappointment
ill
suffice
to
peel
off
the
label
and
retreat
the
country
estate
in
my
mind
o
overall
i
can
tell
that
they
tried
with
this
beer
but
its
nothing
spectacular
its
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
the
style
buy
for
a
quick
buy
id
maybe
reconcider
a
one
thumb
up
sampled
on
march
12
2011
from
the
22
fl
oz
bottle
this
pours
a
fairly
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
practically
no
head
but
continuig
carbonation
it
gets
cloudier
as
the
bottle
empties
the
aroma
is
crisp
with
its
orange
and
lemon
citrus
punch
and
vague
spices
the
body
is
on
the
thin
side
the
taste
also
has
a
solid
lemon
and
orange
peel
zestiness
with
a
kind
of
yeasty
backdrop
and
a
mild
hopped
ending
it
was
refreshing
but
not
necessarily
a
goto
beer
drinkability
is
ok
this
is
a
mildrefreshing
drink
but
nothing
exceptional
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
d
drank
easily
low
abv
easy
finish
nonconfrontational
flavors
while
its
easy
it
drink
its
not
flavorful
enough
to
have
the
desired
cant
put
the
glass
down
drinkability
drinkability
this
is
an
above
average
beer
simple
and
refreshing
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
i
like
at
a
bbq
to
enjoy
it
and
not
need
to
think
about
it
this
is
described
as
a
belgianstyle
wit
although
it
is
definitely
an
americanized
version
thereof
deep
straw
in
color
it
pours
with
a
thin
head
and
the
first
sip
reveals
a
noticeable
herbal
hoppy
nose
perhaps
indicating
dry
hopping
light
and
spicy
there
is
only
a
faint
whiff
of
the
expected
fruitiness
instead
this
is
more
of
a
spicy
little
pale
ale
with
a
little
estery
twist
hoping
i
will
be
able
to
find
this
back
home
this
one
was
pretty
tasty
i
didnt
taste
the
spices
until
the
very
end
the
last
sip
had
a
subtle
ginger
taste
to
it
so
far
ive
been
happy
with
all
the
beers
from
cisco
that
ive
tried
when
it
said
it
was
brewed
with
spices
i
was
a
little
leery
but
the
overall
effect
was
not
as
offensive
as
it
can
be
with
some
beers
pretty
drinkable
no
complaints
here
md
light
to
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
just
not
good
not
going
to
finish
this
one
and
dont
normally
pour
beers
out
i
doubt
it
is
too
old
since
i
got
it
in
ma
but
its
possible
i
assume
this
is
not
a
summer
seasonal
since
my
december
6pack
was
very
fresh
ill
be
looking
for
it
again
when
warm
weather
returns
as
i
thought
it
to
be
very
refreshing
overall
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
it
has
a
nice
water
like
feel
that
is
very
quenching
as
well
as
being
easy
on
the
pallet
the
low
abv
makes
this
beer
a
great
session
beer
and
went
well
with
the
pizza
i
was
having
poured
a
not
quite
clear
light
golden
color
or
cloudy
if
you
swirled
in
the
light
bottom
sediment
half
inch
head
with
a
very
little
lace
first
whiff
smelled
of
peach
and
mild
orange
taste
of
wheat
malt
and
the
same
fruity
peach
and
orange
but
what
hurt
the
taste
was
the
very
weak
carbonation
mouth
feel
was
light
but
flat
that
just
killed
the
whole
thing
for
me
also
not
getting
that
coriander
or
spice
that
should
be
there
this
beer
a
pass
a
notch
above
decent
would
be
a
good
answer
to
a
session
of
sweaty
weedpulling
or
similar
labor
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
lot
of
fizz
like
a
soda
pop
that
quickly
disapates
lightly
lemony
aroma
wonderful
fruity
lemony
malty
taste
a
little
lemon
a
little
cloves
and
nutmeg
smooth
and
refreshing
particulary
on
a
hot
day
my
favorite
from
cisco
brewers
d
nice
wit
clean
crisp
and
well
worth
a
try
the
flavor
is
good
but
a
bit
over
spiced
for
this
beers
light
body
and
puny
malt
presence
theres
a
lot
of
clove
and
cardamom
perhaps
too
much
so
plus
a
hint
of
cinnamon
not
overly
sweet
which
i
appreciated
chalky
yeastiness
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
a
bit
watery
but
at
least
this
is
a
light
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
also
flavorful
not
bad
but
not
worth
the
price
cisco
commands
for
its
beers
drinkability
a
solid
wit
and
an
interesting
one
spices
abound
here
probably
a
little
too
intensely
but
not
in
an
unenjoyable
way
this
ones
quite
drinkable
too
low
in
alcohol
4
5
dry
spritzy
and
bright
and
inviting
a
few
recipe
tweaks
would
make
this
a
true
world
class
wit
d
i
keep
drinking
these
yet
i
dont
know
why
not
my
style
this
one
though
was
very
uninspired
and
plain
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
lively
white
head
the
aroma
is
phenolic
and
fruity
with
apricot
and
ginger
the
flavor
is
like
a
gingersnap
light
crisp
gingery
and
a
little
fruity
with
some
cinnamon
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
refreshing
and
summery
d
not
supper
high
but
you
can
hang
your
hat
on
this
for
a
while
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
witbier
some
nice
citrus
lemon
smell
and
taste
would
try
again
overall
an
interesting
lemony
witbier
not
what
i
would
expect
but
definitely
worth
trying
out
the
lemon
character
is
the
stand
out
feature
in
my
mind
got
this
bottle
from
jdiddy
in
the
recent
heavy
metal
bif
paired
with
king
diamonds
welcome
home
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
straw
capped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
cinnamon
nutmeg
cardamom
wheat
coriander
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
zest
cardamom
coriander
light
wheat
orange
peel
and
a
tiny
stab
of
hoppy
bitters
the
body
is
a
very
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
crisp
refreshing
feel
overall
a
tasty
understated
wit
a
very
nice
summer
quaff
get
some
d
interesting
i
drank
this
beer
following
a
run
so
the
light
and
refreshing
nature
of
the
beer
kind
of
hit
the
spot
but
at
the
same
time
it
missed
on
several
levels
so
this
wasnt
bad
and
i
would
drink
it
again
but
not
really
my
favorite
either
sadly
the
bottle
as
in
many
cases
does
not
live
up
to
the
draught
a
hazy
pale
yellow
pour
with
white
14
inch
head
but
sticky
lace
the
aroma
lends
to
its
witbier
nature
with
yeast
lemon
and
pepper
the
flavor
likewise
offers
this
up
in
a
bright
bubbly
but
not
too
thin
or
lightbodied
way
clean
and
a
bit
creamy
this
is
a
lovely
summer
beer
and
not
an
ipa
as
my
buddy
thought
since
it
was
called
an
ale
in
a
pint
glass
this
beer
was
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
a
pleasant
citrus
aroma
some
fresh
hay
lemon
taste
a
bit
of
malt
then
the
beer
just
flattened
out
really
blah
mouthfeel
very
bland
not
a
very
good
wit
i
wont
be
tryin
this
again
pinesol
color
er
i
mean
somewhat
dark
lemonadish
in
color
with
a
loose
and
fluffy
head
that
was
rather
difficult
to
generate
oranges
dominate
the
aroma
followed
by
lemons
and
some
pepper
plus
some
floor
polish
the
lemon
kind
of
course
nice
stream
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
too
a
real
battle
in
the
taste
between
the
oranges
and
the
lemons
the
oranges
come
out
on
top
but
not
in
a
good
way
very
little
evidence
of
yeast
or
any
real
beer
flavor
this
is
mostly
a
citrus
cooler
and
the
beer
is
surprisingly
flat
given
the
bubbles
it
tastes
more
like
an
orange
rickey
than
beer
just
add
ice
a
swimming
pool
a
cheap
novel
and
a
humid
afternoon
blahblah
pass
it
looked
lively
and
bright
but
it
ended
up
tasting
quite
stale
and
leaving
a
strange
aftertaste
maybe
there
is
something
wrong
with
this
particular
bottle
all
and
all
a
little
disappointed
if
this
is
suppose
to
represent
new
england
beers
a
decent
attempt
but
not
really
fulfilling
a
good
witbier
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
smells
flowery
even
more
than
the
citrus
and
juniper
berry
taste
is
very
flavorful
and
a
tad
spicy
more
floral
notes
definitely
had
the
delicate
characteristics
of
a
belgian
beer
mouthfeel
is
carbed
and
light
very
enjoyable
brew
d
great
session
beer
i
am
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
and
this
one
impressed
me
great
well
balanced
beach
beer
holds
flavor
well
throughout
very
drinkable
solid
brew
an
interesting
concept
that
isnt
quite
my
style
but
a
very
interesting
new
interpretation
of
a
wit
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
straw
color
no
head
and
barely
any
lacing
to
speak
of
nose
is
clean
crisp
whiffs
of
yeast
and
wheat
with
an
ample
amount
of
banana
and
clove
taste
starts
smooth
wheat
grains
and
spices
clove
and
corriander
fill
the
middle
and
the
finish
is
flavors
of
banana
and
apple
light
bodied
high
carbonation
crisp
feel
with
a
nice
clean
finish
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
summertime
beer
there
is
some
balance
going
from
sweetish
to
dryish
it
could
be
tastier
and
creamier
but
hits
general
outline
of
the
style
pouring
the
last
of
it
made
it
murky
but
didnt
improve
it
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
taste
is
very
different
than
most
wits
i
almost
get
a
cinnamonsugar
type
flavor
here
for
some
reason
it
works
really
well
it
tastes
delicious
body
is
light
and
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
with
a
lingering
coriander
spice
note
it
was
very
easy
to
polish
off
this
bomber
before
i
even
finished
the
review
i
guess
that
makes
it
highly
drinkable
pours
a
very
clear
very
pale
yellow
colored
body
looks
like
a
cider
small
wispy
head
white
in
color
very
quickly
diminishing
effervescent
aroma
once
swirled
some
citrus
and
light
fruit
like
pear
some
funkiness
too
some
funky
taste
drying
malty
sweet
with
a
pretty
clean
finish
not
very
flavorful
waiting
to
warm
funky
fruity
flavors
not
my
thing
poured
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
crown
of
foam
the
best
smelling
witbier
ive
ever
experienced
coconut
piña
colada
pineapple
orange
marmalade
ripe
almost
green
banana
candy
orange
slices
with
raw
sugar
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
spice
from
the
cardamon
tart
fruity
esters
with
light
cracker
crust
reminiscent
of
lemon
meringue
pie
with
a
thinner
than
expected
mouthfeel
i
shared
this
amongst
friends
and
wish
i
had
more
seek
this
out
picked
this
up
on
my
last
trip
to
boston
and
trekked
it
back
home
instantly
put
into
my
kegerator
i
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
beer
pours
a
dull
murky
gold
with
just
a
hint
of
a
off
white
head
that
leaves
absolutely
no
lacing
and
has
very
crappy
head
retention
this
actually
is
one
of
the
ugliest
beers
ive
head
the
pleasure
of
pouring
the
aroma
is
rather
weak
hints
of
lemon
zest
cardamon
bready
yeasts
and
just
a
bit
of
ripe
fruits
the
flavor
follows
suit
pretty
closely
ripe
apples
and
pears
cardamon
biscuits
and
just
a
slight
tang
used
from
the
wheat
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
bright
carbonation
and
a
bready
dryness
im
rather
disappointed
that
i
lugged
this
back
from
boston
in
my
pack
instead
of
buying
another
bottle
of
dfh
squall
to
bring
back
home
the
yeast
could
be
more
flavorful
but
its
a
good
one
for
summer
drinkability
soso
witbier
in
my
opinion
as
it
needs
a
bit
more
pop
fromn
some
citrus
and
less
clove
tasty
wit
pours
a
one
finger
white
head
that
vanishes
leaving
no
lace
cloudy
amber
color
quite
a
bit
of
yeast
in
bottom
of
bottle
lightmedium
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
slight
yeasty
nose
flavor
is
slight
lemon
and
yeast
with
some
honey
at
finish
good
on
a
hot
day
like
today
91
7
25
for
a
22oz
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
of
a
dud
as
this
one
was
rather
flat
thinner
style
and
swishy
in
the
mouth
overall
i
had
no
trouble
downing
this
and
was
ok
with
flavors
presented
but
the
structure
of
the
beer
was
off
there
are
better
ones
out
there
flavor
starts
off
nicely
with
a
spicy
herbal
kick
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
green
tea
leaves
and
a
decidedly
citric
hop
burst
finish
the
experience
body
is
highly
carbonated
but
it
compliments
the
light
mouthfeel
and
adds
a
refreshing
quality
to
the
wit
all
in
all
a
solid
thirstquenching
brew
that
i
could
see
myself
having
again
especially
on
a
hot
austin
day
like
today
overall
an
excellent
wit
that
kept
getting
better
as
it
warmed
try
this
one
a
tad
warmer
than
normal
for
a
wit
my
sample
is
half
a
year
old
so
cant
wait
to
try
a
fresh
one
later
this
year
i
knew
it
was
older
when
i
traded
for
it
was
dying
to
try
it
even
off
season
johnnnniee
is
amazing
trader
and
would
never
send
old
beer
to
you
i
requested
it
to
see
how
it
varies
highly
recommend
would
be
in
heavy
rotation
if
available
here
d
a
nice
local
attempt
at
the
belgian
style
but
a
long
way
to
go
still
enjoyable
to
drink
though
this
is
a
fine
american
play
on
a
belgian
wit
grey
lady
takes
what
i
love
about
wits
and
runs
with
it
the
nose
is
phenomenal
and
the
drinkability
is
killer
in
a
world
of
mediocre
american
wits
this
one
is
a
topnotch
belgian
contender
overall
though
i
have
to
say
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
one
easily
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
in
the
style
as
far
as
flavor
just
needs
a
little
work
on
the
body
and
it
is
there
still
very
solid
and
something
i
would
love
to
try
again
drinkability
not
altogether
bad
lets
just
leave
it
at
that
huh
out
of
the
bottle
this
one
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
chalk
white
head
one
finger
thick
displayed
very
nice
retention
and
lacing
soft
nose
of
citrus
and
nutmeg
with
maybe
coriander
complex
flavors
lemon
zest
sweetened
grapefruit
like
candy
generic
tropical
fruit
in
the
middle
followed
by
the
dry
nutmeg
finish
the
strong
nutmeg
on
the
generic
fruit
adds
a
pumpkin
pie
like
quality
medium
carbonation
could
be
smoother
but
a
great
tasting
beer
and
worth
trying
from
a
twentytwo
ounce
bottle
pours
palewhite
in
color
slightly
cloudy
with
a
small
almost
head
smells
of
lemons
fruit
and
malt
first
sip
is
flowery
very
sweet
and
flowery
but
with
a
strong
bitter
finish
light
bodied
with
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
it
was
very
light
but
to
sugary
making
it
a
challenge
to
finish
also
its
more
of
a
generic
belgian
pale
then
wit
im
not
even
sure
if
there
are
any
oats
although
there
is
some
orange
peel
on
the
finish
i
like
it
good
first
impression
for
a
brewery
that
just
barely
started
sending
beer
to
vt
d
easy
drinking
and
palate
pleasing
more
importantly
ciscos
grey
lady
offers
something
that
many
american
versions
of
the
witbier
style
dont
refinement
the
nose
expresses
wheat
malt
with
a
hint
of
coriander
its
far
from
overly
spicy
and
its
certainly
not
tart
and
fruity
or
even
chalky
with
citrus
rind
or
yeast
rather
theres
just
a
pleasant
edge
to
awaken
the
nose
in
an
otherwise
basic
beer
the
body
is
light
to
medium
as
it
should
be
and
the
pinpoint
carbonation
is
delicate
but
effervescent
enough
to
bristle
the
tongue
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
the
aroma
but
there
is
a
bit
more
fruitiness
to
it
mainly
orange
with
some
minor
lemon
once
again
however
its
kept
to
a
minimum
and
it
acts
as
a
part
of
the
beer
rather
than
its
main
focus
its
delicate
and
refreshing
with
just
enough
residual
fruit
and
spice
left
in
the
aftertaste
to
remind
you
that
youre
drinking
something
just
a
little
bit
more
interesting
than
the
standard
fare
worth
trying
and
based
on
personal
experience
a
great
summer
quencher
a
well
crafted
wit
with
full
flavors
not
as
light
and
refreshing
as
other
versions
of
the
style
this
is
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
beer
with
enough
novelty
to
make
it
a
particularly
interesting
witbier
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
fairly
frothy
white
head
that
does
lace
the
smell
is
floral
yeasty
with
a
touch
of
spice
and
fruitiness
like
clove
and
pineapple
and
lemon
the
taste
is
very
interesting
it
has
all
of
the
spicy
floral
and
citrus
tastes
of
a
classic
wit
but
there
are
some
interesting
added
spices
here
my
guess
is
a
touch
of
cardoman
the
carbonation
improves
the
overall
mouthfeel
which
is
usually
fairly
watery
for
a
witbier
there
is
a
bit
of
a
pepperish
bite
in
the
finish
which
makes
the
experience
even
more
enjoyable
and
lively
this
is
an
excellent
beer
from
a
brewery
that
is
fast
becoming
the
best
regional
micro
in
new
england
lchaim
like
most
wheat
beers
in
warm
weather
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
hazy
yellowcolored
beer
extremely
lively
carbonation
and
a
typicallycisco
massive
creamy
head
smell
is
all
lemonyorange
and
spice
its
fantastic
tastes
just
like
it
smells
heavier
on
the
lemon
this
is
amazing
beer
superrefreshing
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
pair
with
some
seafood
this
might
turn
into
my
goto
beer
for
the
season
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filling
at
all
decent
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
good
lighter
belgian
beer
i
was
not
as
impressed
as
some
others
have
found
this
it
is
a
solid
witbier
flavor
but
otherwise
is
a
rather
neutral
offering
served
in
a
tulip
glass
pale
straw
in
color
with
zerohead
and
very
little
lacing
during
the
tasting
scents
of
lemon
zest
orange
peel
and
spices
clove
corriander
etc
taste
similar
to
nose
but
grassy
character
becomes
pronounced
as
well
as
belgian
yeast
i
have
to
say
that
i
generally
like
witbiers
but
some
of
the
flavor
characters
tend
to
be
a
little
over
the
top
for
me
during
the
latter
half
of
the
tasting
this
was
not
the
case
with
grey
lady
very
flavorful
but
also
somewhat
subdued
pleasantly
effervescent
mouthfeel
and
slightly
tart
lemony
finish
drinkability
was
superb
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
very
high
as
the
label
says
quenching
i
am
sure
to
pick
this
up
again
im
really
enjoying
thismy
first
bottle
was
one
of
those
wow
beer
experiences
that
well
as
a
beer
lover
im
always
seeking
bravo
a
new
release
from
cisco
as
far
as
i
can
tell
there
is
a
cool
label
with
a
mermaid
on
the
cover
goes
for
about
eight
bucks
a
bomber
pour
is
golden
with
nice
white
heading
taste
is
of
lemon
wheat
and
other
tropical
fruits
definitely
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
well
executed
wits
i
have
encountered
in
a
while
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tulip
glass
cloudy
light
orange
with
copious
white
head
and
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
like
a
solid
hefeweizen
yeasty
fruit
esters
pineapple
bubble
gum
banana
tastes
like
a
pretty
solid
wheat
beer
a
lot
of
citrus
lemon
orange
absent
are
the
spicy
notes
nice
clean
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
a
little
soapy
and
very
smooth
and
easily
quaffable
this
beer
is
a
solid
beer
for
spring
and
summer
bbq
the
low
abv
argues
against
the
winter
aspect
of
it
its
such
an
enjoyable
beer
it
could
be
imbibed
year
round
hands
down
the
best
us
wheat
beer
ive
had
love
the
can
for
convenience
and
portability
surprisingly
drinkable
the
whole
concept
is
a
surprise
but
its
a
pleasant
wheaty
brew
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
can
light
golden
and
nearly
clear
body
suprising
for
a
wit
half
inch
of
soapy
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
apples
oranges
grass
cracked
pepper
moderate
spice
pepper
character
with
tangy
oranges
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
subtle
fruity
sweetness
mild
coriander
in
the
nose
and
flavor
easy
drinking
pretty
good
a
bottle
poured
into
an
ipa
glass
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
clean
white
head
that
is
decent
and
leaves
some
streaks
and
spots
of
lace
all
along
the
glass
a
slow
fade
leaves
a
mild
covering
nose
is
excellent
with
a
healthy
sourness
and
wheat
malt
twang
that
shows
amazing
spiciness
considering
that
this
is
not
spiced
im
blown
away
by
the
amount
of
clove
light
coriander
bubblegum
pepper
and
faint
banana
and
light
fruit
esters
all
from
just
the
grains
hops
what
there
is
and
yeast
taste
showcases
classic
wit
tartness
and
lemony
citrus
notes
mild
cloves
and
cinnamon
flow
to
a
tight
light
bitterness
that
releases
bubblegum
and
soap
leaving
a
surprising
dark
graininess
that
lingers
with
mild
almost
graham
like
cracker
flavors
cinnamon
and
cloves
hang
in
the
background
feel
is
velvety
smooth
and
light
with
a
mild
creaminess
superb
drinkability
and
all
around
deliciousness
a
great
wit
and
right
up
there
in
my
top
five
as
a
winter
ale
the
light
and
drinkable
nature
may
seem
a
bit
of
a
contradiction
the
flavor
and
satisfaction
in
the
drinking
make
for
an
enjoyable
winter
brew
that
would
also
do
well
in
the
warmer
months
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
very
enjoyable
not
sure
what
type
of
style
this
beer
is
going
for
the
beer
doesnt
have
a
strong
coriander
presence
so
it
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
witbier
the
flavors
are
much
more
of
a
hefeweizen
the
beer
doesnt
have
the
softness
of
most
hefeweizens
i
would
say
the
beer
is
an
american
wheat
ale
that
uses
a
bavarian
yeast
strain
not
bad
an
easy
drinker
nice
change
of
pace
beer
wasnt
paying
attention
when
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
thought
it
was
more
of
a
winter
warmer
with
that
aside
the
beer
was
just
not
tasty
bland
and
thin
flavor
is
more
green
apple
dominant
with
a
lightly
phenolic
clove
and
pepper
finish
overall
a
solid
beer
that
is
worthy
of
a
shot
i
can
taste
the
spices
but
overall
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
be
a
little
lacking
overall
solid
effort
easy
drinking
and
gotta
love
16
ounce
cans
i
wanted
a
stronger
nose
unfortunately
served
in
a
straight
glass
flavor
is
complex
starts
sweet
but
ends
dry
lots
of
spices
true
to
style
just
not
my
thing
did
not
enjoy
it
at
all
one
word
describes
this
beer
blah
nothing
particularly
notable
about
it
perhaps
the
worst
beer
ive
had
from
bells
rating
justified
with
a
review
basic
white
ale
pretty
tasty
but
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
but
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
tasted
bananas
and
a
bit
of
spice
hazy
yellow
color
solid
and
enjoyable
some
citrus
and
spice
notes
as
a
winter
brew
it
feels
out
of
place
among
the
holiday
selections
though
it
tastes
more
like
a
march
day
when
spring
is
trying
to
push
winter
aside
meh
bitterness
doesnt
work
very
thin
great
tasting
alternative
to
dark
winter
beers
definitely
one
of
the
more
underated
beers
out
there
a
very
tasty
enjoyable
beer
t
bready
and
fruity
banana
and
sweet
citrus
some
clove
and
banana
mildly
bitter
citrus
aftertaste
not
a
real
fan
of
wheat
beers
good
as
wheat
beers
go
o
personally
i
dont
partake
in
a
lot
of
whitewheat
ales
but
this
one
is
enjoyable
and
seems
above
average
for
the
style
not
to
my
liking
a
style
i
really
gotten
a
tast
for
light
yellow
pour
without
much
head
tastes
very
similar
to
blue
moon
or
shock
top
easy
to
drink
pretty
good
seasonal
not
strong
at
5
and
not
a
particularly
mind
blowing
beer
but
solid
overall
this
is
more
of
a
refreshing
summer
brew
i
would
like
this
after
mowing
the
lawn
the
smell
is
citrusy
with
a
splash
of
bubble
gum
and
banana
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
a
slight
tang
and
is
fairly
spritzy
not
bad
but
not
exciting
save
one
for
summer
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
imbibed
at
the
bells
eccentric
cafe
in
a
spiegelau
witbier
glass
it
really
does
make
a
difference
also
be
sure
not
to
drink
this
at
too
low
of
a
temperature
overall
i
have
become
a
fan
i
like
wheat
ales
i
like
witbier
why
dont
i
care
for
this
btw
i
very
much
dislike
the
new
set
up
of
ba
typing
out
characters
as
required
by
this
site
now
to
rate
seems
a
little
watered
down
ok
but
unsure
where
when
and
what
tastes
too
much
like
a
hoegaarden
to
me
which
isnt
my
style
not
a
fan
poured
it
into
their
new
glassware
they
are
very
cool
solid
wheat
ale
for
the
holiday
really
good
beer
in
its
class
soft
golden
color
it
does
have
a
cloudiness
it
has
a
light
citrus
odor
this
is
a
very
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
blend
between
a
honey
weiss
and
blue
moon
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
that
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
tripel
wheat
just
not
as
pronounced
this
was
a
winner
if
you
dont
care
for
real
dark
or
hoppy
beers

did
a
nice
job
with
this
brew
overall
im
giving
bells
winter
white
ale
a
solid
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
damn
cool
fermented
with
belgian
yeast
no
spices
used
so
this
is
sort
of
a
pale
lighter
belgian
winter
warmer
and
not
a
witbier
at
all
in
a
sense
but
it
is
none
the
less
i
tried
this
on
tap
at
my
local
pub
the
beer
had
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
and
minimal
lacing
a
slight
fruity
yeasty
smell
also
comes
out
in
the
taste
no
taste
of
coriander
or
clove
but
it
does
have
a
good
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
pretty
solid
witbier
and
i
would
order
it
again
i
know
this
often
gets
rated
lower
than
most
bells
beers
or
many
beers
in
general
but
i
like
it
to
me
its
a
simple
refreshing
everyday
winter
beer
thats
goes
down
easy
i
can
drink
it
with
dinner
or
while
watching
the
ballgame
i
like
the
fruitiness
and
the
spices
i
will
admit
that
it
borders
on
a
summer
beer
rather
than
a
winter
but
i
truly
enjoy
it
its
one
of
those
beers
i
try
not
to
overthink
i
just
like
it
as
a
solid
simple
balanced
beer
pours
a
nice
dark
and
hazy
gold
the
white
head
burns
off
quickly
the
aroma
is
light
hit
has
nice
light
spice
and
wheat
notes
the
taste
is
much
the
same
if
not
a
little
more
robust
it
has
nice
thickness
and
a
pleasant
hint
of
carbonation
i
had
beer
at
my
local
taproom
acloudy
yellow
glass
was
brought
to
me
in
a
standard
pint
glass
si
didnt
pick
up
too
much
here
just
a
touch
of
yeast
and
hops
tnot
much
going
on
here
i
got
a
small
amount
of
hops
banana
and
yeast
o
light
easy
drinking
beer
not
very
complex
but
very
enjoyable
and
non
offensive
i
found
that
the
remainder
of
my
glass
went
very
well
with
the
pizza
that
was
brought
to
me
i
would
pick
this
up
for
a
lazy
afternoon
where
you
just
want
something
light
normally
dont
go
in
for
wits
but
this
is
pretty
good
pours
a
very
pale
cloudy
yellow
heavier
mouthfeel
light
and
belgiany
overall
slight
spice
apparently
just
from
the
malts
the
description
says
none
were
added
and
fruity
on
the
nose
and
palate
abrupt
finish
where
did
all
that
head
run
off
too
seems
undercarbonated
banana
pineapple
funky
yeast
on
the
nose
but
none
of
that
in
the
flavor
crisp
and
clean
to
a
fault
not
offensive
but
wont
cop
again
the
first
beer
i
have
ever
had
from
bells
that
was
a
let
down
and
honestly
one
of
the
few
that
wasnt
amazing
this
pours
thick
and
murky
tired
yellow
with
basically
no
head
from
the
tap
its
got
a
ton
of
viscosity
and
minimal
carbonation
the
opposite
of
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
banana
yeast
and
spice
and
orange
esters
in
the
nose
some
citrus
to
the
taste
but
way
too
much
grain
here
especially
the
wheat
it
lacks
all
the
delicate
features
of
the
bets
wits
and
warms
up
ugly
im
surprised
this
came
from
bells
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
nowhere
near
their
full
potential
i
see
the
winter
side
of
it
and
appreciate
the
attempt
but
i
just
doesnt
pan
put
here
was
super
excited
when
i
saw
the
amount
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
bottle
but
to
be
honest
it
didnt
live
up
to
my
expectations
i
was
on
a
beer
tour
this
particular
evening
and
had
enjoyed
an
unibroue
blanche
de
chambly
earlier
in
the
evening
and
when
compared
to
this
other
north
american
brew
i
found
myself
disappointed
but
its
not
a
bad
belgian
white
i
just
found
the
unibroue
better
still
better

most
american
belgian

i
dont
get
wits
in
general
but
i
really
dont
get
the
winter
wit
seasonal
at
all
winter
is
a
time
for
hearty
beers
i
find
it
hard
to
enjoy
winter
seasonal
beer
typically
on
the
other
hand
bells
winter
white
ale
is
a
wonderful
exception
tried
in
a
tall
boy
pint
it
has
a
very
refreshing
taste
i
imagine
even
more
robust
from
a
tap
although
i
didnt
see
color
aroma
is
slighty
citrus
and
that
is
the
definition
of
the
finish
the
belgian
yeast
makes
this
an
incredibly
enjoyable
beer
i
found
a
winter
seasonal
that
i
would
definitely
order
again
hopefully
on
tap
good
refreshing
overall
drinkable
session
beer
id
return
to
someday
but
not
my
favorite
bells
meh
totally
drinkable
but
also
totally
meh
given
the
quality
of
their
other
offerings
i
was
expecting
more
cheers
had
on
tap
was
good
beer
but
considered
it
fitting
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
extremely
solid
witbier
from
bells
i
would
love
if
this
were
available
in
the
summer
especially
over
oberon
but
it
is
a
nice
switch
up
from
all
the
winter
stouts
light
more
crisp
than
creamy
turn
down
the

or
get
a

full

that
would

this
one
is
very
european
with
a
sweet
funky
yeast
aroma
there
is
peach
and
apricot
notes
with
a
lot
of
fresh
bread
aromas
the
flavor
follows
suit
quite
funky
almost
like
a
saison
style
sweet
and
malty
and
tangy
and
slightly
sour
all
at
the
same
time
the
mouth
is
light
and
refreshing
but
effervescent
and
refreshing
this
isnt
a
beer
id
come
to
often
but
definitely
one
worth
trying
and
enjoying
o
solid
wit
fits
the
style
good
flavor
winter
white
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
there
is
a
spicey
aroma
with
strong
wheat
notes
and
strong
orange
peel
notes
the
flavor
is
a
nice
wheat
and
malty
backbone
with
good
spices
and
nice
orange
flavors
nice
full
body
overall
its
a
nice
wheat
beer
for
the
winter
pours
a
clean
gold
with
an
excellent
long
lasting
3
finger
head
aromas
of
banana
and
bubble
gum
followed
by
malt
are
present
on
the
nose
of
the
beer
malt
and
lemon
rind
on
the
palate
with
a
watery
finish
small
bubbles
and
and
a
light

with
a
medium
finish
an
ok
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
with
mild
white
head
belgian
yeast
smell
is
characteristic
with
pale
malts
contributing
to
the
mellow
and
light
flavor
barley
and
wheat
malt
taste
with
very
slight
notes
of
citruscoriander
medium
body
crisp
carbonation
a
nice
light
and
drinkable
winter
beer
especially
if
you
arent
big
on
spice
o
good
combination
and
certainly
refreshing
overall
i
like
how
its
a
white
ale
that
doesnt
have
any
of
the
spices
or
orange
flavor
poured
out
dark
orange
that
is
semitranscelucent
defintely
cant
see
through
it
though
the
head
was
pretty
tiny
and
had
no
retention
smells
pretty
malty
pretty
sweet
with
no
hint
of
hops
taste
is
quite
sweet
and
tastes
like
belgian
yeast
the
bananaclove
yeast
really
it
tastes
nice
for
a
wit
pretty
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
with
some
nice
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
whit
tastes
just
like
i
would
want
it
too
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
whit
overall
this
is
a
great
whit
seems
to
be
underrated
o
its
nice
to
have
a
winter
witbier
on
the
market
so
enjoying
the
style
i
like
it
its
just
not
the
best
though
far
from
the
worst
example
of
the
style
ive
had
high
c
the
rest
a
very
good
beer
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
a
good
winter
alternative
to
a
warmer
a
good
wheat
beer
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
i
will
certainly
purchase
this
again
as
a
fun
easy
to
drink
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
burger
and
fries
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
nice
white
head
that
lingers
and
laces
well
light
aroma
of
wheat
spice
probably
clove
and
belgian
yeast
well
carbonated
with
a
light
body
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
it
tastes
as
a
wit
should
with
spice
being
the
primary
flavor
in
this
case
clove
coriander
and
a
slight
citrus
background
nice
clean
finish
not
in
the
same
league
as
allagash
white
but
a
fine
beer
have
i
mentioned
how
refreshing
this
is
the
complexity
is
all
in
the
fruits
which
may
sadly
overpower
the
spice
not
quite
on
par
with
allagash
white
but
close
o
a
nice
witbier
certainly
better
than
some
others
on
the
market
lots
of
co2
fizzy
light
citrus
aromas
that
are
slightly
overwhelming
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
good
foamy
head
that
persists
in
addition
to
citrus
there
is
a
nutty
flavor
that
is
there
but
does
not
add
much
to
the
beer
overall
nice
to
drink
once
but
would
not
buy
again

some

strong

up

with

and
just
a
hint
of
funky

throughout
feels
like
more
of
a

than
a

plenty
of
carbonation
gives
a
little
prickle
on
the
tongue
crisp
finish
that
is
not

present
for
me
in

o
nice
beer
that
goes
down
easy
a
enjoyable
change
of
pace
wit
beer
that
compliments
the
seasonal
offerings
o
i
like
this
beer
alot
i
think
this
beer
could
be
served
year
round
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
i
want
to
drink
alot
around
christmas
time
overall
i
liked
it
more
with
each
sip
normally
witbiers
have
that
super
sweet
banana
clove
and
especially
coriander
taste
but
this
isnt
like
that
much
at
all
a
respectable
seasonalsessionable
beer
o
overall
not
wild
about
wit
beers
in
general
but
this
is
very
good
for
the
style
o
this
is
another
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
from
bells
i
like
all
these
refreshing
wheat
beers
serving
as
winter
seasonals
there
are
plenty
of
big
and
hearty
beers
out
there
during
the
cold
months
these
are
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
make
me
think
of
warmer
weather
never
a
bad
thing
very
similiar
to
trade
joes
wheat
beer
almost
ashamed
to
admit
that
id
like
something
like
that
but
if
you
look
at
this
beer
and
that
beers
ratings
they
are
almost
identical
a
nice
light
witbier
good
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
good
would
have
again
o
it
was
a
good
beer
very
light
refreshing
and
sweet
good
carbonation
very
decent
could
drink
large
quantities
of
this
without
getting
bored
o
overall
its
alright
definitely
not
even
in
the
top
ten
for
bells
though
this
beer
pours
a
a
pale
cloudy
it
has
a
yellowish
tint
looks
good
the
taste
is
spicy
with
a
light
citrus
this
is
a
really
refreshing
beer
not
as
dark
and
robust
as
a
lot
of
winter
seasonals
this
is
a
really
drinkable
winter
ale
i
actually
did
some
yard
work
this
morning
and
came
inside
and
cracked
this
open
turned
out
to
be
a
really
good
choice
this
is
a
good
afternoon
lighter
beer
its
fresh
flavored
who
says
you
have
to
have
dark
beer
in
the
winter
anyways
ive
had
this
before
in
the
past
but
its
been
awhile
pours
a
cloudy
tangerine
color
looks
almost
like
freshly
squeezed
orange
juice
thinner
head
than
expected
but
it
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
yeasty
orange
wheat
tastes
are
nice
with
fruity
belgian
yeast
esters
wheat
orange
zest
white
peppery
spiciness
i
thought
i
could
taste
coriander
but
apparently
theres
none
used
in
the
brewing
process
mouthfeel
is
nearly
fullbodied
while
being
creamy
and
smooth
overall
better
than
i
remember
and
one
of
the
better
american
brewed
witbiers
o
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
but
lacks
any
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
properties
however
the
added
flavors
of
spices
seem
to
make
this
a
nice
choice
to
drink
if
you
want
to
enjoy
a
witbier
during
the
winter
httpwww

d
an

at

theres
nothing
wrong
per
se
but
this
one
falls
short
of
my
expectations
for
both
bells
and
the
style
an
interesting
winter
interpretation
but
nothing
more
i
cant
recommend
in
good
conscience
and
likely
wont
indulge
in
again
myself
overall
a
very
good
witbier
packed
with
a
nice
array
of
flavors
thanks
to
a
decent
contribution
from
malt
wheat
yeast
and
hops
all
at
once
nice
amount
of
spice
balanced
by
a
subtle
wheat
sweetness
and
a
blend
of
citrus
and
hops
not
bad
at
all
great
beer
that
surprises
me
everytime
always
happy
to
finally
order
one
every
year
without
really
seeking

brew
loaded

but
this

features
just
enough
heft
and
yeast

to
provide
a
witbier
unlike
its
summer
counterparts
when
youre
looking
for
an
escape
from
the
bold
and
strong
beers
of
the
season
look
no
further
othe

was
wayy
off
the
taste
was
much
better
but
there
isnt
much
reason
to
drink
this
brew
overall
another
solid
seasonal
from
bells
not
a
beer
that
i
am
gonna
race
to
get
next
winter
but
it
sure
hits
the
spot
after
a
bit
of
a
burn
out
on
heavier
and
darker
drinks
easy
to
find
as
most
mi
bars
have

overall
a
nice

flavor
the
sediment
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
bothered
me
and
the
smell
was
pretty
bland
a
good
beer
but
was
expecting
more
from
bells
no
substance
and
all
water
overall
an
above
average
wit
beer
that
has
some
nice
citrus
flavours
going
on
its
very
drinkable
but
at
times
it
reminded
me
of
something
like
a
blue
moon
or
a
shock
top
anyways
still
happy
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
see
it
out
again
ill
admit
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
good
one
sure
ill
have
another
do
this
americanbrewed
wit
brings
a
minimalist
impression
seeming
held
back
by
it
the
smell
works
but
could
be
more
intense
while
the
appearance
is
pleasing
in
its
luminous
impenetrability
the
flavors
seem
underdeveloped
which
doesnt
really
elevate
this
beer
over
notables
of
the
style
it
is
refreshing
but
not
at
all
memorable
belgian
white
ales
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
an
excellent
example
i
am
grateful
that
bells
releases
this
in
the
winter
as
opposed
to
the
summer
it
gives
me
something
to
enjoy
during
the
winter
months
when
i
want
a
break
from
the
heavier
winter
beers
if
you
enjoy
belgianstyle
wit
beers
do
not
pass
this
one
up
o
witbier
is
a
style
of
beer
that
i
dont
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
and
is
sometimes
quite
questionable
this
is
the
best
witbier
i
have
had
so
far
for
anybody
who
is
curious
about
the
style
i
dont
know
of
any
better
for
a
beginner
this
is
a
good
beer
for
about
any
occasion
pour
is
a
cloudy
yellow
no
real
head
from
a
semi
aggressive
pour
sweet
oranges
and
a
nice
spiciness
light
body
has
a
full
yeasty
body
but
a
nice
sweet
orange
feel
to
it
lemon
rind
as
well
a
spiciness
that
im
assuming
is
from
the
yeast
finishes
clean
pours
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
with
a
head
that
quickly
fades
to
nothing
save
for
a
few
bubbles
dotting
the
rim
and
a
frothy
film
some
cloudy
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
smell
is
grain
skunk
some
pepper
a
touch
of
citrusy
hops
and
an
odd
dryer
sheet
scent
taste
is
crisp
corn
off
the
bat
fading
into
a
peppery
citrus
hop
taste
ending
with
more
corn
and
a
slightly
unpleasant
aftertaste
of
skunky
grain
theres
some
smoke
flavoring
in
there
as
well
a
friend
remarked
it
tasted
exactly
like
beef
jerky
a
tad
undercarbonated
finish
is
dry
overall
a
pretty
nice
wit
it
has
a
nice
feel
and
a
pretty
good
flavor
but
is
just
a
little
weak
in
smell
and
aroma
othis
witbier
really
does
it
for
me
not
overally
spiced
or
flavored
but
a
beautiful
smooth
taste
that
is
simply
delicious
from
start
to
finish
it
does
taste
a
bit
more
like
a
hefeweizen
fruits
present
are
more
banana
than
citrus
than
most
d
i
like
my
veggie
on
a
plate
but
it
was
fun
to
try
i
recommend
this
one
it
is
well
worth
trying
has
the
big
beer
hefeweizen
sort
of
rich
and
bready
flavor
profile
on
a
sessionably
low
abv
with
the
texture
and
easy
drinking
qualities
of
a
regular
witbier
i
used
to
love
these
belgian
white
ales
but
its
safe
to
say
im
over
them
one
every
now
and
then
is
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
but
even
then
im
looking
elsewhere
for
my
wit
fix
o
all
in
all
ill
preface
by
saying
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
witbiers
that
being
said
this
one
is
a
little
syrupy
and
has
that
classic
witbier
taste
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
overall
not
a
great
beer
its
decent
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
try
this
if
you
like
the
style
o
i
am
a
white
ale
fan
and
i
was
really
suprised
by
this
one
had
a
great
creamy
spiciness
to
it
well
balanced
different
for
a
winter
beer
definitely
not
my
favorite
witbier
and
like
most
witbiers
i
cant
figure
out
if
i
like
it
or
not
o
a
good
witbier
hard
to
believe
this
is
not
brewed
with
any
spices
it
is
very
coriander
forward
tasting
beer
is
light
and
mildly
spicy
with
a
nice
finish
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
is
an
average
not
very
orangey
citrusy
backing
to
it
interesting
but
not
great
in
fairness
i
drank
this
beer
to
cap
off
a
night
where
i
had
already
drank
my
top
2
rated
beers
on
this
site
and
was
just
looking
for
something
that
didnt
leave
me
completly
hung
over
the
next
morning
this
beer
tasted
like
a
nice
wheat
beer
with
a
little
bit
of
winter
spice
kick
the
color
was
really
light
which
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
winter
brew
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
refreshing
brew
and
a
nice
winter
alternative
o
this
is
a
well
balanced
witbier
the
usual
spices
and
fruit
notes
play
well
together
and
dont
overwhelm
o
overall
id
say
its
pretty
good
its
not
the
best
wit
ive
had
but
its
not
bad
either
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
id
still
recommend
it
because
its
a
good
wit
o
nice
and
refreshing
witbier
would
be
great
in
the
hot
summer
weather
very
nice
wit
style
for
the
winter
great
mouthfeel
very
smooth
and
light
flavor
was
righton
i
enjoyed
the
belgianstyle
flavor
nice
but
not
too
overbearing
overall
this
is
a
go
to
beer
for
the
winter
and
wish
it
was
available
year
round
will
need
to
stockup
while
its
in
the
market
o
very
refreshing
good
mix
of
flavor
and
not
overly
sweet
overall
not
a
badtasting
brew
at
all
but
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
to
it
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
is
a
nicely
sippable
beer
that
is
quite
refreshing
and
well
worth
drinking
that
said
it
is
at
best
a
solid
workmanlike
witbier
that
i
wont
hesitate
to
have
again
but
which
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
acquire
since
i
prefer
the
st

much
like
your
typical
witbier
mouthfeel
is
standard
for
this
syle
of
beer
falls
short
for
a
winter
style
beer
taste
the
spices
stick
in
the
mouth
this
takes
away
from
the
desirability
overall
this
beer
is
way
to
typical
and
the
spices
take
away
from
this
beer
not
our
cup
of
brew
drinkable
just
not
something
we
prefer
o
awesome
drinkability
but
not
very
interesting
pretty
basic
definitely
a
spicywinter
drink
its
nice
but
not
great
it
doesnt
particularly
stand
out
from
other
belgian
whites
but
its
a
solid
brew
from
bells
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style
with
only
a
slight
departure
from
normal
witbier
prep
without
the
packaging
i
would
not
have
noticed
this
one
is
seasonally
nuanced
a
winter
ale
for
the
tropics
perhaps
o
nice
flavors
nothing
that
wowed
me
almost
like
a
hef
i
suspect
that
this
batch
is
a
little
old
which
is
why
its
a
bit
underflavors
and
doesnt
live
up
to
expectations
of
some
other
witbiers
it
almost
tastes
like
its
been
watered
down
still
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
pretty
easy
drinking
if
not
particularly
interesting
wheat
from
a
lottle
to
a
pilsner
glass
very
cludy
pale
yellow
in
apprearance
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
grassy
aroma
taste
is
grassy
with
wheat
and
hint
of
citrus
this
tastes
like
a
thin
hefeweizen
strong
carbonation
smooth
mouthfeel
tasty
and
overall
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
just
dont
expect
a
punch
overall
although
the
first
impression
is
not
great
going
by
the
appearance
and
aroma
its
one
of
the
better
witbiers
i
have
experienced
well
done
once
again
bells
o
a
great
belgian
white
that
leaves
me
satisfied
out
of
all
the
seasonal
beers
this
year
i
could
definitely
say
i
really
enjoy
this
one
usually
when
i
think
belgian
white
beer
i
do
not
associate
it
with
winter
overall
this
is
a
very
good
witbeer
it
doesnt
try
to
be
too
much
just
as
advertised
nice
job
bells
pretty
thin
for
my
tastes
but
its
still
good
flavor
o
there
are
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
bad
wits
than
good
ones
in
this
country
imo
this
was
one
of
the
latter
edit
ive
read
that
this
beer
is
brewed
without
the
addition
of
any
spices
not
sure
if
thats
true
but
if
it
is
its
a
testament
to
the
artfulness
of
the
brewer
theres
a
yeasty
complexity
that
really
imparts
the
clove
and
coriander
seed
flavor
nice
alternative
to
the
more
heavy
handed
spiced
wits
on
the
market
appearance
is
a
cloudy
gold
color
the
modest
head
fades
pretty
quickly
with
no
lacing
left
behind
the
scents
and
taste
are
very
much
like
a
hefeweizen
banana
and
clove
come
through
strongly
in
both
and
there
is
a
slight
lemony
note
as
well
nothing
outstanding
going
on
just
a
good
solid
wheat
beer
bells
ought
to
sell
this
year
round
as
a
hefe
id
put
it
about
on
par
with
sierra
nevadas
kellerweis
overall
impression
a
great
refreshing
white
ale
from
bells
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
from
this
style
have
enjoyed
many
wit
biers
lately
and
this
one
is
just
a
notch
above
average
wouldnt
mind
picking
up
some
of
the
newer
stouts
from
bells
o
confuses
me
plenty
of
other
white
ales
id
rather
have
o
while
i
give
bells
props
for
creating
a
white
beer
as
a
winter
seasonal
i
find
that
there
are
some
good
reasons
why
its
not
often
done
as
a
white
beer
its
pretty
mediocre
and
as
a
winter
seasonal
im
still
confused
overall
very
smooth
weak
and
easy
to
drink
too
watered
down
for
my
liking
this
could
be
a
nice
beer
to
give
a
rookie
or
non
beer
drinker
its
not
bad
but
there
are
alot
better
beers
of
this
style
out
there
not
the
greatest
wit
ever
but
a
solid
offering
and
a
nice
treat
every
now
and
then
during
the
winter
months
when
a
good
fresh
wit
can
be
hard
to
find
o
while
not
the
best
winter
offering
from
bells
its
still
a
staple
i
try
to
pick
up
a
sixer
at
least
once
a
winter
do
drinkability
is
moderate
a
more
phenolic
take
on
the
style
this
isnt
going
to
blow
any
minds
but
its
definitely
solid
im
not
sure
how
id
feel
drinking
this
in
the
dead
of
winter
as
i
seem
to
enjoy
these
beers
more
in
the
warmer
months
but
i
guess
ill
have
to
try
it
again
later
in
the
winter
to
find
out
o
the
head
was
disappointing
but
the
nose
and
taste
are
solid
nice
alternative
to
other
winter
offerings
o
not
too
impressed
but
its
not
too
bad
either
though
its
a
decent
tasting
beer
i
think
bells
fell
a
little
short
of
my
expectations
on
this
one
there
are
plenty
of
better
witbiers
out
there
and
i
doubt
ill
be
clamoring
to
buy
more
winter
white
for
a
while

the

overall
a

for
a

this
is
a
very

cry
from
your
bluemoonesque

this
is

overall

easy

but
just
doesnt
dance
on
the
palate
as
vividly
as
some
other
wits
that
i
really
liked
over
the
years
o
this
is
way
too
light
to
be
a
winter
seasonal
they
could
have
added
more
body
to
this
and
it
would
have
been
a
little
better
i
wish
the
finishing
spices
would
have
been
balanced
by
the
lemon
zest
like
in
the
middle
of
the
beer
o
decent
white
ale
nothing
is
wrong
with
it
except
the
lack
of
visible
yeast
but
it
is
nothing
that
exciting
overall
i
generally
really
enjoy
bells
but
this
one
didnt
do
it
for
me
83
on
tap
or
in
bottle
tap
better
of
course
i
recommend
this
seasonal
ale
while
you
can
get
it
the
taste
is
balanced
and
mild
with
sharp
wheat
notes
and
orange
zest
playing
leisurely
with
a
little
spice
for
warmth
pleasant
and
enjoyable
overall
actually
pretty
decent
its
not
groundbreaking
though
it
doesnt
taste
like
most
wits
ive
had
its
less
spicy
but
nicely
balanced
o
this
beer
seems
like
a
good
merger
of
the
american
pale
wheat
with
a
witbier
worth
a
try
a
dilemma
of
a
beer
to
rate
if
this
is
a
witbier
it
missed
the
mark
simply
not
enough
spice
and
offkilter
flavors
then
again
maybe
its
us
and
not
bells
that
think
its
a
witbier
fair
enough
but
that
leads
to
the
next
problem
as
far
as
i
can
tell
winter
white
is
completely
indistinct
from
oberon
would
love
to
drink
them
together
because
i
think
theres
no
more
than
a
whisker
difference
lastly
theres
really
no
seasonal
panache
to
this
whats
winter
about
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
though
this
is
a
tasty
if
unremarkable
beer
and
thats
what
matters
most
overall
its
not
among
the
styles
i
prefer
but
a
good
branch
out
and
overall
solid
brew
overall
a
pretty
good
attempt
at
witbier
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
this
is
a
decent
inoffensive
and
light
tasting
beer
that
isnt
very
complex
im
a
little
disappointed
because
seasonal
beers
tend
towards
possessing
attributes
that
fit
with
the
season
halloween
gets
the
crop
of
pumpkin
flavored
beers
summer
sometimes
rustles
up
some
sort
of
jalapenoflavored
creation
and
so
on
this
winter
beer
has
nothing
wintry
about
it
apart
from
the
name
and
the
label
artwork
certainly
nothing
that
suggests
the
scents
and
smells
of
winter
cinnamon
nutmeg
pine
chocolate
burning
wood
or
even
a
decadeold
rock
hard
fruitcake
the
scents
are
typical
average
witbier
bread
wheat
and
yeast
theres
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
but
its
gone
quickly
and
doesnt
translate
into
taste
which
is
similarly
average
so
why
am
i
paying
11
bucks
for
a
six
pack
of
this
when
i
could
be
trying
that
allagash
dubbel
i
passed
over
pours
dark
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
smell
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
with
a
nice
dose
of
wheat
flavor
follows
suit
nice
yeast
and
wheat
flavors
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
smooth
well
balanced
and
nice
depth
of
flavor
overall
a
great
witbier
great
flavor
and
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
it
is
like
a
good
fastball
to
the
point
but
states
its
purpose
very
well
this
is
an
expertlycrafted
wheat
ale
o
a
nice
witbier
i
would
definitely
have
again
seems
strange
to
have
it
be
a
winter
beer
but
why
not
o
yeah
pretty
average
across
the
board
wont
be
paying
to
drink
this
again
when
there
are
so
many
more
flavorful
witbiers
out
there
the
first
letdown
ive
had
from
bells
o
wasnt
overly
impressed
with
this
beer
had
an
ok
taste
but
ive
had
much
better
witbiers
than
this
overall
very
poor
example
of
a
witbier
doesnt
seem
thick
enough
but
it
does
have
good
smell
and
great
appearance
overall
a
satisfying
and
nicely
spicy
wheat
beer
with
enough
complexity
to
set
it
apart
winter
though
taste
echoes
the
aroma
upfront
with
sweet
wheat
malt
coriander
and
ornage
finishes
clean
with
a
lingering
orange
juice
flavour
and
a
light
spiciness
o
a
pretty
middle
of
the
road
and
mediocre
witbier
not
my
favorite
this
brew
pours
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
there
was
a
slight
amount
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
was
a
little
spicy
and
had
some
wheat
aromas
the
taste
has
a
light
spice
to
it
with
a
kind
of
refreshing
lemon
zest
mouthfeel
is
a
little
light
and
is
a
little
watered
down
overall
ive
never
understood
why
a
white
ale
would
be
a
winter
release
i
prefer
the
dark
winter
brews
personally
this
is
an
ok
brew
o
kind
of
a
blah
wit
overall
o
decent
brew
almost
a
summer
brew
for
winter
a
weak
sister
to
a
tripell
as
far
as
the
flavor
nice
drinker
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
a
good
beer
anyway
not
so
much
a
winter
warmer
as
it
is
a
belgian
as
expected
from
bells
a
nice
beer
impressive
with
no
spices
not
great
but
not
bad
overall
its
light
and
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
it
manages
to
be
bold
enough
to
miss
being
boring
but
it
isnt
that
exciting
either
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
thats
all
i
would
drink
it
again
but
id
be
more
likely
to
try
something
else
first
o
a
very
nice
brew
honestly
id
rather
have
a
glass
on
a
hot
summer
day
than
by
the
fire
but
really
theres
no
bad
time
of
year
to
enjoy
a
good
beer
medium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
effervescence
smoothish
finish
leads
to
a
nice
malty
banana
fade
a
good
brew
finish
coriander
sticks
with
you
for
some
time
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
on
the
back
of
the
palate
fairly
drinkable
not
anything
that
stands
out
but
satisfies
as
a
wheat
beer
figured
id
take
this
one
down
now
seeing
that
winter
is
in
its
death
throes
round
here
knock
on
wood
it
pours
a
thoroughly
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
coriander
mint
pine
orange
peel
and
wheat
honestly
the
sharp
bit
of
mint
i
get
does
nothing
good
for
the
smell
but
its
luckily
not
enough
to
sabotage
the
entire
occasion
the
taste
though
does
away
with
this
unpleasantness
while
straying
none
too
far
from
the
path
already
laid
out
by
the
smell
the
orange
peel
though
is
a
touch
stronger
than
before
and
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
is
thrown
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
wit
nuff
said
good
witbier
not
exactly
a
style
meant
to
wow
the
drinker
yet
still
bells
provides
a
flavorful
offering
not
generally
found
this
time
of
year
nice
wheat
beer
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
though
this
one
goes
down
like
water
or
orange
juice
a
great
session
beer
md
light
bodied
very
clean
and
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
solid
d
i
know
this
beer
is
not
for
everyone
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
wheats
especially
around
the
holidays
overall
its
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
just
a
little
thin
and
watery
honestly
there
are
much
better
offerings
for
the
price
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
will
necessarily
buy
again
d
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
filling
very
mild
kick
ok
representation
of
style
it
hit
the
spot
that
evening
and
is
something
i
would
certainly
drink
again
d
it
is
an
alright
beer
i
do
not
think
that
i
will
seek
it
out
but
i
would
not
turn
one
done
either
pours
a
bit
of
a
hazy
yellow
color
nice
white
head
on
it
smells
sweet
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
taste
is
very
refreshing
very
smooth
wheat
with
lemon
taste
good
medium
bodied
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
good
drinkability
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
this
beer
in
the
future
d
a
different
twist
on
a
winter
beer
its
very
much
in
the
hefeweizen
style
but
doesnt
have
the
crispness
in
the
finish
youd
want
in
the
summer
very
tasty
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
it
seems
like
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
wasnt
100
on
the
first
few
sips
but
by
the
end
of
the
beer
i
had
completely
changed
my
mind
a
great
taste
an
awesome
aroma
these
are
the
traits
than
rang
through
the
most
for
me
a
little
too
flat
looking
in
its
appearance
maybe
also
i
like
to
see
the
lacework
on
the
side
of
my
glass
and
this
had
none
the
head
leaves
quickly
but
the
smell
and
taste
is
spot
on
not
a
winter
warmer
but
a
good
bear
nevertheless
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
nicely
drinkable
but
i
dont
get
the
winter

i

just
think
it
has
more
character
and
depth
id
like
to
see
this
one
in
bottles
over
the
summer
bighugedec
16
little
orange
maybe
something
else
that
i
cant
quite
finger
taste
was
not
as
strong
or
malty
as
i
was
anticipating
and
left
a
litte
sour
on
the
palate
to
me
they
might
have
been
better
going
all
out
and
making
a
strong
hefe
banana
and
a
lessthandesirable
egg
aroma
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
yeast
banana
big
orangebanana
smoothie
flavors
dull
any
intended
coriander
or
other
spices
its
a
very
tasty
beer
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
what
is
to
say
way
to
sweat
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
wouldnt
recommend
to
someone
unless
i
didnt
like
them
tastes
like
feet
and
honey
the
worst
bottled
beer
ive
ever
had
theres
a
taste
in
it
that
is
part
perfumed
soap
and
part
rubbery
dolls
from
the
60s
or
70s
i
feel
out
of
duty
i
need
to
finish
these
but
it
is
a
sacrifice
when
there
is
lots
of
decent
beer
in
my
fridge
its
sweet
and
thick
but
it
seems
that
it
would
be
or
should
be
a
lighter
beer
its
okay
if
i
wanted
something
on
the
sweet
side
i
might
partake
in
it
again
but
im
clambering
to
get
back
to
the
store
to
get
some
more
it
is
a
mix
of
flavors
that
just
do
not
work
with
each
other
horrible
the
single
worst
thing
ive
ever
drank
raw
sewage
water
would
of
tasted
better
not
the
worst
shock
top
product
ive
had
but
the
honey
flavor
tastes
very
artificial
this
is
the
worst
shock
top
ive
ever
had
honey
bourbon
cask
wheat
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
small
head
there
is
a
big
honey
and
wheat
aroma
there
is
a
big
honey
flavor
creamy
wheat
backbone
very
fizzy
and
artificial
flavors
overall
it
has
a
strong
flavor
but
its
too
strong
with
the
honey
and
the
flavor
is
artificial
and
its
fizzy
even
with
that
its
not
the
worst
looks
pretty
but
the
flavor
isnt
for
me
a
great
tasting
beer
with
a
true
honey
taste
over
powered
w
bland
bourbon
flavor
drinkable
but
not
much
else
poured
a
burnt
orange
color
with
very
little
head
smells
like
warm
honey
and
bourbon
taste
much
like
mixing
a
bourbon
and
a
shock
top
together
with
a
smooth
feel
gives
mixed
emotion
on
taste
too
bourbonesque
or
not
enough
beerish
overall
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
beer
and
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
the
style
it
lived
up
to
its
name
when
it
came
to
the
honey
but
when
it
came
to
the
bourbon
cask
it
got
weird
and
in
the
end
it
made
for
a
beer
that
just
didnt
taste
good
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
its
a
little
smooth
very
crisp
prickly
not
filling
and
the
taste
doesnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
no
need
for
another
one
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
was
a
nice
looking
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
nasty
dirty
sock
aspect
it
was
just
unwanted
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
and
i
for
sure
wouldnt
recommend
it
all
in
all
i
just
didnt
like
this
beer
its
not
for
me
and
i
dont
find
it
to
be
enjoyable
this
is
my
least
favorite
shock
top
beer
and
one
of
the
my
least
favorite
of
the
style
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
beer
just
wasnt
good
drinkable
but
not
terribly
good
the
base
beer
is
very
smooth
but
the
honey
leaves
an
aftertaste
that
i
dont
care
for
overall
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
its
a
45100
a
cc
in
grade
if
youre
looking
to
try
some
different
when
it
comes
to
beer
this
definitely
is
one
for
you
to
consider
its
just
the
honey
sweetness
and
the
citrusy
flavors
just
do
not
go
well
with
each
at
all
i
cant
recommend
you
willing
try
this
beer
sweet
with
a
vanilla
bourbon
finish
o
just
plain
bad
wife
picked
this
up
in
a
pick
your
own
six
never
again
gotta
love
these
random
shock
top
flavors
amiright
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
kinda
hazy
golden
amber
topped
by
a
finger
or
so
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
buttercream
caramel
a
hint
of
bourbonsoaked
wood
and
a
kiss
of
sweetgrass
the
taste
pretty
much
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
competing
sweetnesses
kinda
clashing
a
bit
though
generally
just
canceling
each
other
out
for
the
most
part
leaving
just
a
vague
sense
of
sweet
on
your
tongue
buttressed
by
some
very
mild
bourbon
notes
every
now
and
again
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
mostly
smooth
feel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bland
beer
especially
given
the
expressive
name
but
i
mostly
enjoyed
it
chalk
it
up
to
my
massive
sweet
tooth
but
this
aint
bad
just
not
that
great
overall
this
wasnt
the
stfest
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
in
fact
its
actually
drinkable
it
aint
half
bad
guys
im
gonna
try
heating
the
rest
of
mine
up
in
a
saucepan
on
the
stove
brb
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
the
taste
soda
syrupy
sweetness
fake
honey
some
sort
of
spices
that
mimic
bourbon
i
dont
know
its
like
bourbon
flavor
for
kids
i
dont
really
consider
this
beer
some
sort
of
alcoholic
malt
beverage
artificially
sweetened
only
the
honey
taste
comes
through
no
bourdon
notes
at
all
smells
like
honey
and
burnt
wood
tastes
like
burnt
wood
thick
in
feel
and
actually
made
me
vomit
haha
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
the
regular
shock
top
and
bourbon
but
this
beer
was
off
the
mark
would
not
have
it
again
has
a
taste
similar
to
root
beer
with
a
kick
would
buy
it
again
this
could
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
undrinkable
with
an
almost
artificial
sweetness
to
it
i
specifically
bought
this
because
of
the
extremely
poor
reviews
to
see
if
they
were
justified
they
were
drain
pour
didnt
expect
it
to
be
good
but
this
was
horrid
oof
da
truly
a
miss
rjt
fair
flavor
for
what
it
is
not
a
fan
of
the
bourbon
flavor
smells
awful
slight
taste
of
honey
which
is
its
only
redeeming
quality
otherwise
it
is
what
i
would
generally
call
skunky
and
almost
sour
the
honey
bourbon
in
my
opinion
has
a
great
honey
taste
and
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
i
would
have
no
complaints
having
another
one
the
weakest
shock
top
offering
i
have
had
by
far
and
im
one
of
the
few
who
really
support
the
brand
and
enjoy
its
offerings
between
chocolate
honeycrisp
apple
pretzel
and
raspberry
honeybourbon
at
least
in
this
diluted
mediocre
form
is
a
truly
failed
attempt
to
be
crafty
rather
than
competent
one
of
the
worst
beers
didnt
finish
light
honey
taste
no
real
bourbon
notes
i
got
this
beer
with
a
seasonal
12
pack
i
had
the
lowest
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
ended
up
as
the
best
one
of
the
bunch
a
definite
strong
honey
flavor
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
so
not
sure
about
head
or
color
not
true
to
style
at
all
but
it
isnt
painful
to
drink
like
most
reviews
would
lead
you
to
believe
not
even
close
to
being
my
favorite
shock
top
see
twisted
pretzel
loved
that
one
no
lie
but
im
not
drainpouring
this
or
even
regretting
twisting
off
the
top
the
worst
beer
ive
had
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
can
remember
having
had
one
flavor
honey
and
it
isnt
a
good
honey
flavor
this
proves
how
bad
a
bourbon
barrel
beer
can
be
and
that
it
doesnt
magically
make
a
beer
good
a
bit
cloying
not
bad
cloudy
golden
body
with
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
aroma
includes
honey
wheat
and
oranges
the
wheat
and
the
honey
flavors
come
through
a
lot
nothing
in
the
way
of
bourbon
though
somewhat
of
a
fizzy
artificial
orange
flavor
is
there
too
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
thin
doesnt
really
showcase
a
good
example
of
a
wheat
beer
and
the
artificial
orange
spice
flavor
is
unappealing
but
the
strong
honey
flavor
is
somewhat
unique
there
are
flavors
in
this
that
i
am
almost
positive
do
not
occur
in
nature
i
wanted
to
enjoy
this
in
a
completely
non
ironic
way
but
was
too
much
for
me
sweetness
from
the
honey
was
a
little
overpowering
in
my
opinion
after
reading
the
few
ratings
of
this
beer
i
was
wondering
why
i
made
the
purchase
but
after
my
initial
waft
and
taste
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brew
not
sure
i
would
ever
buy
again
but
i
will
not
pour
down
the
drain
i
wonder
if
a
slice
of
lemon
would
go
well
with
this
beer
o
probably
the
most
unpleasant
thing
ive
come
across
in
a
while
not
fun
to
drink
at
all
hints
of
bourbon
and
honey
that
dont
perfectly
blend
together
for
some
reason
in
this
but
not
terrible
i
cant
even
describe
the
taste
as
i
have
never
experienced
a
flavor
like
this
before
its
as
unpleasant
as
inhaling
the
dense
smoke
of
burning
rubber
i
had
to
pour
mine
down
the
sink
good
think
i
only
bought
one
bottle
in
a
sampler
pack
ok
i
should
have
not
been
expecting
much
coming
from
a
major
brewer
but
after
having
some
of
shock
top
other
offerings
being
chocolate
wheat
honey
crisp
apple
wheat
and
raspberry
wheat
which
were
all
decent
i
thought
this
might
be
a
good
choice
i
was
wrong
this
beer
was
a
mess
it
was
not
enjoyable
and
all
over
the
place
it
was
too
sweet
and
not
in
a
good
way
bourbon
cask
where
i
did
not
find
any
hint
of
a
bourbon
cask
i
couldnt
find
a
way
to
enjoy
this
beer
other
than
pouring
it
down
the
drain
thankfully
i
was
able
to
give
it
away
stay
away
from
this
beer
what
ever
it
is
but
i
dont
like
this
beer
you
know
its
bad
when
you
take
a
sip
and
pour
the
rest
down
the
drain
this
is
a
pitiful
offering
of
a
bourbon
barrel
dont
waste
your
cash
hmmm
how
do
i
put
this
oh
yeah
do
not
drink
this
shite
i
get
it
most
will
say
what
did
you
expect
from
a
major
brewer
but
the
bigs
do
make
a
consistent
product
and
theres
a
lot
to
be
said
for
that
but
this
is
grotesque
from
the
strong
acridy
urine
smell
and
color
like
someone
who
hasnt
properly
hydrated
in
a
while
to
the
disgusting
spice
notes
that
violate
your
taste
buds
this
is
completely
undrinkable
its
just
blechh
seriously
did
they
dump
everything
from
the
spice
rack
in
here
i
swear
its
like
i
bit
into
matted
rotting
lavender
and
heather
turf
from
someones
garden
followed
by
the
cloying
vanilla
sweetness
of
cream
soda
and
how
come
i
cant
rate
this
a
zero
its
coming
up
1
i
poured
this
down
the
drain
and
even
the
sink
gurgled
in
disgust
at
this
crap
man
wheres
the
kerosene
and
a
blowtorch
i
need
to
rinse
my
mouth
3
40
78
b
worst
shock
top
product
ive
ever
had
and
possibly
the
worst
beer
period
cant
believe
this
made
it
to
the
shelves
overall
this
was
not
good
at
all
in
my
opinion
the
flavor
was
downright
bad
and
the
texture
didnt
compliment
the
experience
i
will
not
drink
this
again
even
if
it
was
free
again
like
the
chocolate
one
this
is
so
insanely
over
flavored
as
to
be
not
even
really
beer
anymore
but
i
have
to
admit
that
the
honey
aroma
and
taste
as
pungent
as
it
is
and
as
out
of
proportion
as
it
is
actually
tastes
pretty
decent
its
like
those
honey
whiskeys
that
are
all
the
rage
right
now
so
much
like
raw
been
pollen
honey
stinging
the
nostrils
and
tastebuds
i
actually
do
taste
a
little
wheat
malt
in
this
one
but
very
minimal
on
the
bourbon
only
in
the
finish
the
honey
is
so
intense
like
honey
flavored
medicine
almost
like
a
scented
candle
or
something
not
really
appealing
for
consumption
but
still
a
neat
sensory
experience
sweetness
is
there
in
the
finish
but
its
not
overly
sweet
and
with
bright
carbonation
its
actually
rather
drinkable
if
you
can
handle
the
intensity
of
the
honey
for
me
its
weird
because
i
always
think
of
honey
as
highly
fermentable
so
how
do
they
get
so
much
honey
flavor
there
in
the
beer
without
it
being
super
sweet
it
makes
no
scientific
sense
so
for
me
it
has
to
be
artificial
that
said
i
kind
of
like
this
series
for
what
it
is
a
guilty
pleasure
of
mine
1
155
i
just
uh
what
the
flying
fuck
is
this
was
recommended
by
a
friend
and
now
i
think
about
it
a
bit
before
asking
somebody
a
recommendation
it
looked
good
medium
brown
almost
no
head
it
smelled
like
ricola
cough
drops
and
tasted
the
same
but
also
musty
and
dirty
i
drank
one
to
see
if
it
was
maybe
just
the
own
bottle
but
the
next
was
the
same
a
i
dumped
them
all
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
ever
drank
actually
i
threw
3
in
the
garbage
horrible
stuff
mouthfeel
was
a
45
though
impressively
bad
i
am
glad
i
only
got
one
in
a
variety
pick
my
own
six
pack
thought
a
honey
wheat
from
a
bourbon
cask
sounded
intriguing
instead
tasted
what
i
imagine
a
honeybourbon
candle
would
taste
like
if
you
could
liquify
it
at
46
degrees
f
truly
awful
i
wanted
to
try
this
and
was
adamant
about
buying
a
6
pack
of
it
one
night
a
friend
of
mine
tried
to
convince
me
not
to
because
he
said
its
terrible
i
should
have
listened
i
should
have
bought
crappy
pbrs
instead
i
have
had
over
1000
micros
and
this
is
by
far
the
worst
i
have
ever
had
i
figured
i
would
try
it
because
the
bourbon
the
label
said
was
in
it
instead
what
i
got
was
a
bad
beer
and
the
after
taste
is
repulsive
i
would
rather
be
chewing
on
dirty
socks
awfull
and
overall
it
is
shock
top
nuff
said
nasty
just
nasty
couldnt
even
drink
two
without
pouring
out
now
if
you
like
bourbon
it
would
be
up
your
alleyes
but
this
mixture
is
terrible
honey
beer
and
bourbon
to
much
going
on
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
had
in
10
years
there
is
absolutely
no
balance
and
the
taste
was
very
unpleasant
confirmed
this
with
3
other
friends
making
sure
it
wasnt
my
taste
buds
on
the
fritz
and
the
consensus
was
unanimous
no
one
wanted
another
sip
i
would
turn
this
variety
down
if
offered
at
no
cost
tastes
like
rather
flat
wheat
beer
with
caramel
flavoring
a
bump
of
rum
in
other
words
hard
enough
to
finish
one
let
alone
drink
two
tastes
okay
until
the
after
taste
hits
your
tongue
tastes
like
your
chasing
a
beer
with
a
shot
of
honey
will
never
buy
this
again
good
i
dont
really
like
the
maple
aftertaste
it
reminds
me
of
a
maple
hard
cider
i
tried
once
this
beer
is
the
most
awful
tasting
beer
that
i
have
ever
tried
the
overall
taste
was
repulsive
and
the
after
taste
was
very
unpleasant
those
with
me
that
tried
it
were
unanimous
and
no
one
would
drink
beyond
two
sips
thumbs
down
i
liked
shock
top
choco
wheat
last
winter
their
only
halfway
worthy
offering
in
my
opinion
this
particular
brew
is
almost
as
bad
as
leinies
sunset
wheat
not
too
bad
for
a
production
beer
i
like
the
real
craft
brews
and
one
cannot
compare
the
only
thing
good
about
this
beer
is
it
was
cold
drank

and
gave
the
other
5
back
to
the
store
without
a
refund
tasted
like
what
a
beer
might
taste
in
a
severely
used
with
ground
in
sweat
army
boot
my
god
what
were
they
thinking
i
enjoyed
the
original
shock
top
belgian
wheat
but
so
far
i
havent
found
any
of
the
other
flavored
ones
to
be
any
good
and
this
one
comes
in
ranked
at
the
bottom
of
them
all
o
not
as
sweet
as
i
had
expected
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
but
this
is
way
underrated
and
the
reason
is
clearly
because
it
is
made
by
the
people
who
make
bud
dont
get
me
wrong
budweiser
is
terrible
but
shock
tops
beers
arent
at
all
the
same
thing
more
honey
than
bourban
not
bad
for
a
mass
produced
unique
beer
if
there
is
such
a
thing
this
burnt
orange
beer
keeps
no
head
and
offers
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
fermented
barley
imitation
vanilla
extract
and
hints
of
honey
it
tastes
like
imitation
vanilla
over
wood
with
somewhat
of
a
cereal
grain
backbone
mouthfeel
is
dry
like
scratchythroat
dry
overall
the
brewer
tried
a
little
too
hard
to
impress
i
dont
ever
drink
shocktop
but
someone
brought
these
for
a
party
this
beer
was
left
in
my
beer
fridge
by
a
friend
watching
my
dog
one
weekend
the
single
bottle
of
shock
top
stared
at
me
for
two
weeks
in
a
week
moment
late
at
night
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
a
sweet
artificial
bourbon
flavor
overpowers
every
taste
im
thinking
cough
drop
gone
bad
but
that
might
be
disrespecting
the
cough
drop
industry
i
couldnt
drink
12
of
this
beer
nasty
damn
nasty
this
beer
is
something
that
instills
an
odd
sense
of
gross
in
me
i
gave
it
proper
scores
where
it
is
needed
but
damn
does
it
taste
just
nasty
semi
sweet
with
a
slight
honey
taste
and
this
nasty
ass
cheapest
bourbon
you
can
buy
taste
to
it
that
just
ruins
it
i
am
sad
i
bought
a
6
pack
to
find
out
what
it
tasted
like
its
like
an
artificially
flavored
wine
cooler
to
the
tune
of
5
5
no
oak
to
speak
of
its
just
swill
and
i
had
to
give
it
a
1
on
taste
didt
smell
that
bad
but
ewwww
avoid
this
at
all
costs
regular
shock
top
is
far
better
definitely
a
desert
beer
it
is
sweet
i
can
understand
why
a
bunch
of
people
dont
likeit
but
as
a
finishing
beer
for
the
night
it
left
me
feeling
really
good
without
a
weird
bitter
taste
on
my
tongue
goes
great
with
wings
i
know
a
bunch
of
people
hate
in
this
beer
but
seriously
give
it
a
chance
you
never
know
what
you
may
enjoy
especially
if
you
view
it
as
a
desert
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
i
bought
a
six
pack
at
the
grocery
store
because
i
thought
it
sounded
interesting
i
keep
trying
a
bottle
every
few
days
because
i
keep
hoping
it
was
just
me
on
the
day
i
tried
it
this
beer
is
disgusting
and
makes
me
want
to
puke
every
time
i
taste
it
i
am
throwing
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
away
or
am
waiting
till
ive
drunk
enough
other
stuff
where
i
might
not
be
able
to
taste
it
gross
dont
even
try
it
o
how
can
this
brew
get
such
low
ratings
its
actually
pretty
good
overall
not
worth
the
2
50
for
the
single
best
to
avoid
if
you
can
not
even
if
you
love
bourbon
ales
ever
picked
up
the
wrong
bottle
from
a
college
dorm
room
during
a
2
day
bender
and
find
that
you
just
swilled
the
residuals
from
an
old
english
800
and
3
spent
cigarette
butts
very
reminiscent
but
i
intentionally
drank
this
one
so
in
accordance
with
the
rules
i
would
classify
this
beer
as
quite
smoky
somewhat
sweet
and
containing
alcohol
it
could
possibly
work
as
a
steak
marinade
i
will
try
repurposing
before
recycling
pouring
it
into
a
cold
glass
helps
it
a
lot
but
it
has
no
head
to
speak
of
its
very
honey
colored
tastes
very
watery
its
probably
something
they
could
rework
and
get
right
but
at
the
moment
its
going
to
be
hard
to
finish
off
the
six
pack
me
giving
it
a
fifth
chance
every
time
you
taste
it
gets
worse
the
bourbon
and
honey
is
present
the
wheat
is
there
too
the
problem
is
it
actually
tastes
like
someone
poured
jack
ds
honey
whiskey
into
a
shitty
sour
wheat
beer
i
give
it
the
blutarski
0
00
rarily
in
one
of
my
reviews
does
the
overall
sum
equal
more
than
its
parts
but
to
me
there
should
be
a
category
for
in
how
interesting
the
beer
is
to
me
perhaps
because
of
my
own
naivety
this
beer
was
far
from
a
dime
a
dozen
while
the
sweetness
was
almost
to
much
it
was
not
something
i
have
experienced
before
and
new
always
scores
well
to
me
the
cloudy
beer
is
always
appealing
i
did
not
love
the
mouthfeel
and
though
i
will
probably
not
do
this
same
beer
again
i
will
recommend
it
to
some
of
my
friends
as
an
interesting
change
of
pace
overall
unique
interesting
the
blend
of
honey
and
bourbon
is
interesting
and
the
spice
really
rounds
it
out
worth
trying
shock

with

this
brew
pours
out
a
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
this
is
an
unfiltered
brew
shock
top
honey
bourbon
cask
wheat
has
a
nice
cloudiness
to
this
brew
the
smell
is
sweet
with
honey
and
grains
so
far
this
brew
is
decent
the
taste
is
different
to
this
brew
it
is
sweet
and
smooth
and
spicy
there
is
a
spice
to
this
brew
like
allspice
or
something
not
much
honey
taste
to
this
brewbut
it
is
sweet
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
and
also
smooth
nothing
bad
but
not
what
i
was
expecting
in
this
brew
there
could
be
more
this
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
5
out
5
its
difficult
to
say
whether
its
more
poorly
crafted
or
illconceived
best
served
with
a
handful
of
raw
jalapeno
slices
after
each
sip
to
obliterate
the
taste
of
this
putrid
concoction
steer
clear
of
this
one
a
higher
ranking
4
overall
for
shock
top
honey
bourbon
cask
wheat
i
would
enjoy
this
brew
with
any
meat
grilled
or
cooked
i
will
most
definitely
by
this
brew
again
taste
palate
its
flavor
starts
off
a
big
sweet
mess
it
is
a
very
odd
sweetness
that
somehow
makes
me
think
of
sweet
potatoes
covered
in
honey
and
marshmallows
then
spiced
with
cardamom
and
cinnamon
mid
way
though
an
odd
bitterness
moves
in
and
brings
a
light
woody
oak
musty
note
it
also
brings
along
some
dry
herballeafy
bitterness
into
the
finnish
its
full
bodied
and
complex
but
not
in
a
good
way
the
palate
feels
smooth
full
and
a
little
slick
which
makes
it
less
drinkable
o
im
wondering
if
ab
had
focus
groups
tastetest
this
before
releasing
it
if
so
its
hard
to
believe
even
50
of
people
would
give
it
a
thumbs
up
its
a
unique
flavor
but
in
this
case
unique
doesnt
mean
good
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
stemmed
glass
showed
a
rich
honey
yellow
brew
with
a
fair
sized
white
head
aroma
is
straight
forward
honey
with
deeper
sweet
notes
taste
follows
with
honey
up
front
and
the
barrel
aged
background
the
honey
and
wood
fight
with
every
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
but
leaves
a
film
on
the
tongue
at
the
finish
on
the
verge
of
a
barrel
aged
beer
but
still
a
little
slim
in
the
mouthfeel
being
it
only
catchs
it
at
the
end
overall
i
think
its
a
good
effort
and
a
nice
stepping
stone
for
people
to
get
into
craft
beer
and
im
all
for
that
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
was
alright
it
tastes
a
bit
like
someone
poured
a
jar
of
honey
into
my
beer
its
so
over
the
top
some
toasted
wheat
or
biscuits
but
more
biscuit
hello
bourbon
where
are
you
i
give
everything
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
this
one
was
not
impressive
tastes
like
a
honey
halls
very
generic
bourbonsoaked
oak
flavor
too
much
honeyeucalyptus
not
an
enjoyable
flavor
wheat
malt
wont
cover
it
very
sweet
really
creepy
faux
honey
flavor
and
l
did
not
taste
any
bourbon
cask
flavor
at
all
although
i
drank
an
entire
bottle
in
hopes
of
acquiring
a
taste
for
it
since
it
was
something
different
for
me
i
would
never
drink
this
again
this
seems
to
be
an
epic
attempt
to
cover
many
flavor
profiles
to
please
many
but
it
probably
pleased
not
a
single
soul
sorry
but
this
is
a
total
bust
for
me
thats
what
i
get
for
trying
something
new
from
one
of
the
macros
i
guess
i
knew
better
but
i
had
to
learn
this
lesson
again
the
hard
way
heres
hoping
i
can
pawn
off
the
other
4
bottles
somehow
a
golden
hue
kind
of
cloudy
with
a
very
fizzy
head
the
aroma
has
some
sweetness
like
a
flower
or
coconut
but
than
theres
a
dirty
dish
water
finish
the
flavor
is
like
cocoa
butter
wheat
and
maybe
lemon
the
bourbon
character
does
not
react
well
with
the
lemony
sweetness
and
it
comes
across
as
medicinal
lemon
cleanser
the
feel
is
very
thin
an
way
too
carbonated
for
a
bourbon
barreled
beer
this
was
given
to
me
for
my
honest
opinion
its
awful
o
overall
a
complete
drain
pour
couldnt
stomach
more
then
a
few
sips
have
no
qualms
about
a
1
0
rating
if
any
beer
is
so
deserving
aroma
flavor
mouthful
and
drinkability
wise
it
is
this
one
an
intriguing
name
and
only
moderately
entertaining
visual
are
the
only
enticing
features
this
offers
everything
thereafter
is
a
complete
utter
mess
o
this
is
not
good
do
not
buy
this
im
glad
i
didnt
pretty
close
to
being
a
drain
pour
but
ill
stomach
it
i
guess
so
one
bottle
of
this
remains
in
grandmas
fridge
i
feel
bad
for
whoever
drinks
it
i
could
he
a
nice
guy
forewarn
them
but
lets
see
what
happens
i
know
my
brotherinlaw
is
coming
next
weekend
ill
tell
him
to
drink
it
this
is
going
down
the
drain
in
favor
of
good
beer
for
an
overall
rating
i
wish
that
ba
had
a
lower
point
on
the
scoring
chart
i
want
to
feel
bad
for
producing
such
a
low
scoring
review
but
my
sense
wont
allow
it
ive
recently
had
the
pleasure
of
attending
a
local
beerfest
held
by
a
neighborhood
microbrewery
featuring
many
local
and
nationwide
craft
beers
where
i
had
laxd
my
research
on
the
available
beer
list
and
wound
up
with
a
brew
that
tasted
like
it
was
made
from
the
scrapings
of
a
teenagers
weed
grinder
where
contents
were
probably
mixed
with
old
resin
to
extend
the
life
of
the
smoke
and
even
that
i
would
choose
over
this
beer
my
only
regret
was
that
i
did
not
find
this
beer
in
a
nice
mix
and
match
single
bottle
section
but
instead
paid
the
monies
for
a
6
pack
and
am
left
with
something
that
i
couldnt
even
leave
in
the
fridge
when
i
move
for
fear
the
untold
judgement
levied
by
the
next
tenant
o
this
looked
like
an
interesting
brew
but
it
just
doesnt
work
at
all
worst
brew
ive
had
from
shock
top
and
shock
top
brews
tend
to
be
mediocre
in
the
first
place
f
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
most
reviewers
would
lead
you
to
believe
its
an
odd
flavor
but
if
you
like
bourbon
honey
or
wheat
brews
then
this
beer
is
at
least
worth
a
try
shock
top
honey
bourbon
wheat
is
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
a
lot
of
or
drink
in
abundance
but
a
interesting
and
cool
beer
to
get
in
a
sampler
pack
or
taste
at
a
pub
im
not
a
fan
of
shock
top
normally
so
i
didnt
expect
much
but
my
low
expectations
were
easily
exceeded
the
honey
wheat
shines
through
nicely
but
the
bourbon
aged
flavor
was
showing
strong
notes
of
vanillacarameloakey
instead
of
the
actual
bourbon
flavor
you
get
from
a
kentucky
bourbon
ale
type
of
brew
oone
of
the
worst
beers
have
ever
had
overall
run
and
hide
from
this
disturbing
concoction
of
liquid
animal
waste
they
should
retitle
it
golden
shower
in
your
mouth
pours
a
hazy
orangehoney
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
of
a
offwhite
head
that
settled
down
to
a
thin
layering
on
top
decent
amount
of
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
when
first
poured
the
aroma
of
a
bourbon
barrel
was
first
noticed
with
some
sweet
honey
very
pleasant
the
taste
was
even
better
with
the
wheat
and
honey
coming
through
but
just
a
hint
of
bourbon
the
aroma
and
taste
was
reversed
actually
very
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
good
carbonation
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
very
pleased
with
this
one
despite
all
the
poor
ratings
on
here
for
this
one
not
sure
what
the
fuss
is
this
is
not
that
bad
of
a
beer
poured
into
my
trusty
pint
glass
and
honey
colored
beer
appeared
smell
of
bourbon
very
mild
but
a
little
noticeable
minimal
head
taste
of
honey
and
wheat
and
not
so
much
on
the
bourbon
not
the
best
tasting
beer
but
this
beer
is
great
on
a
nice
summer
day
i
think
this
beer
is
under
appreciated
overall
i
have
to
say
this
was
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
typically
if
i
have
a
beer
that
tastes
very
off
i
try
another
which
is
what
i
did
here
but
after
two
of
them
being
so
bad
the
same
way
i
wont
ever
have
another
one
of
these
o
shock
top
nails
it
with
the
honey
aspect
of
this
beer
aromatically
anyway
if
this
beer
were
a
candle
id
have
it
lit
constantly
its
got
a
great
nose
of
clover
honey
that
perks
the
senses
right
up
but
the
flavor
doesnt
follow
through
watered
bourbon
dissolves
into
the
thin
body
for
a
beer
thats
clearly
drinkable
in
terms
of
ease
but
doesnt
hold
any
wow
factor
beyond
its
smell
nothing
about
this
beer
turns
me
off
of
course
i
dont
really
want
to
drink
it
either
id
rather
just
smell
it
okay
so
the
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
not
quite
sober
and
liked
it
but
then
i
had
it
again
and
figured
out
that
it
was
not
really
good
at
all
the
honey
flavor
that
i
would
tend
to
like
does
not
really
help
still
a
shock
top
fan
but
ended
up
giving
away
the
last
few
of
these
because
i
was
not
sure
i
could
drink
them
the
smell
was
odd
like
a
humidor
that
had
some
honey
spilled
in
it
the
friend
who
gave
me
this
beer
talked
it
down
and
offered
me
the
rest
of
the
12
pack
he
bought
for
free
i
figured
it
couldnt
possibly
be
that
bad
it
was
at
first
the
beer
tricks
you
into
thinking
its
a
sweet
beer
with
almost
an
overly
sweet
honey
flavor
then
it
kicks
you
in
the
face
with
a
butt
of
a
cigar
flavor
disgusting
i
will
never
recommend
this
to
a
friend
i
wanted
something
other
than
my
usual
ipa
or
stoutporter
i
saw
this
at
my
local
grocery
and
decided
what
the
heck
ill
give
it
a
shot
7
99
for
a
sixer
isnt
too
bad
twisted
off
the
cap
and
took
a
wiff
odd
smell
like
an
artificial
honey
that
is
used
in
cough
medicine
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
it
looks
very
nice
a
hazy
orange
color
minimal
head
ok
time
for
a
taste
wow
and
not
a
good
wow
tastes
like
it
smells
only
10
times
worse
just
an
odd
artificial
honey
taste
no
bourbon
what
so
ever
just
a
big
mess
boy
i
wish
i
would
have
stuck
with
my
normal
ipa
or
stoutporter
thatll
teach
me
to
try
and
be
different
tastes
like
a
honeyinfused
sweet
soft
drink
plenty
of
vanilla
but
the
bourbon
character
is
virtually
nonexistent
this
one
drinks
more
like
a
cream
soda
a
weird
offbalance
cream
soda
not
beer
just
no
overall
this
beer
is
a
drain
pour
from
the
second
you
start
sipping
until
the
end
ab
would
have
to
pay
me
money
to
give
any
positive
review
notes
on
this
beer
a
completely
hideous
beer
experience
that
the
big
boys
can
keep
for
themselves
from
the
bottle
it
almost
appears
as
though
you
have
poured
yourself
a
full
glass
of
honey
the
hue
is
that
close
the
only
thing
lacking
was
clarity
through
the
honeyamber
color
the
smell
was
pure
honey
with
bourbon
with
the
distinct
odor
of
a
wheat
beer
all
blended
well
together
the
mouthfeel
although
a
bit
more
carbonated
for
my
taste
was
thick
and
rich
i
was
just
blown
away
at
the
perfect
blending
of
honey
bourbon
and
wheat
somehow
it
all
mixed
together
very
well
overall
it
was
the
best
beer
ive
had
in
quite
some
time
and
im
glad
to
still
have
a
few
in
the
fridge
to
partake
from
this
beer
sounded
like
something
interesting
to
try
but
i
was
very
disappointed
the
appearance
is
a
nice
orange
wheat
color
the
aroma
has
a
strong
fake
honey
bourbon
smell
and
the
taste
doesnt
make
up
for
it
the
balance
is
all
wrong
i
would
never
purchase
this
again
or
recommend
it
i
was
intrigued
as
soon
as
i
saw
this
in
the
store
and
decided
to
go
for
it
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
still
let
down
its
got
a
definite
honey
taste
and
odor
but
its
highly
artificial
its
similar
to
what
i
would
expect
a
honey
flavored
cough
medicine
might
taste
like
but
its
pretty
weak
so
ill
have
no
problem
finishing
it
off
not
as
bad
as
most
reviews
make
it
out
to
be
but
i
would
not
buy
again
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
belgian
tulip
glass
there
is
oak
in
this
somewhere
wheres
the
wood
who
can
tell
its
a
watery
honey
beer
and
even
if
this
were
a
braggot
its
a
failure
obviously
this
beers
palate
is
designed
by
people
in
marketing
cause
it
is
nothing
like
suggested
on
the
label
and
they
might
as
well
take
bourbon
off
the
label
at
this
point
icky
poopy
overall
run
away
i
try
to
come
to
every
new
beer
with
an
open
mind
but
i
couldnt
drink
this
the
appearance
was
okay
with
a
light
hazel
color
and
the
foam
fizzed
away
quickly
poured
into
a
glass
and
gave
a
sniff
immediately
checked
the
best
by
date
because
it
smelled
like
it
had
soured
when
i
gave
it
a
taste
i
realized
the
smell
is
from
the
absurd
amount
of
honey
in
it
the
beginning
is
too
sweet
and
the
finish
had
an
aftertaste
of
peanuts
not
a
big
fan
o
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
considering
the
hype
not
bad
but
just
not
good
i
wont
be
buying
this
one
again
at
first
this
beer
caught
me
off
guard
it
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
in
fact
ive
never
tasted
another
beer
like
this
this
could
be
a
good
or
a
bad
thing
the
flavor
is
strong
but
not
in
an
overly
hoppy
way
like
an
imperial
ipa
my
only
beef
with
it
is
that
because
the
flavor
is
so
much
different
it
makes
me
think
an
ingredient
is
artificial
the
strong
taste
to
me
only
lasts
the
first
few
sips
and
the
taste
buds
seem
to
acclimate
to
it
and
the
beer
becomes
more
mild
i
would
recommend
anyone
to
try
this
beer
due
to
its
unusual
taste
but
would
also
agree
that
most
people
wont
like
it
as
its
not
piss
beer
but
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
its
not
the
refined
well
balanced
craft
beer
i
found
it
to
be
refreshing
and
enjoyable
too
much
spice
whatever
that
spice
is
i
was
hoping
it
to
be
more
like
the
budweiser
vanilla
bourbon
cask
with
a
hint
of
honey
yuck
pours
a
murky
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
honey
and
sugar
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
watery
honey
and
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
wood
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
poor
beer
that
is
very
honey
forward
but
i
am
not
getting
any
bourbon
characteristics
other
than
a
subtle
wood
quality
on
the
finish
overall
the
smell
was
the
only
thing
worth
anything
here
this
was
actually
pretty
offensive
quite
disgusting
not
much
of
a
head
decent
lacing
hazy
light
amber
hue
odd
perfumelike
nose
cloying
with
faux
booziness
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
odd
perfumelike
flavor
honey
i
guess
bourbon
cask
flavor
sure
but
it
seems
really
force
and
yet
again
odd
belgian
inspired
wheat
no
way
some
of
the
masses
will
fall
for
this
one
but
in
the
end
this
is
an
outright
failed
attempt
to
be
crafty
overall
as
always
im
glad
i
tried
it
im
sure
theres
an
audience
for
this
beer
its
sweet
not
bitter
and
would
probably
appeal
to
somebody
who
wants
sweeterthantypicalbeer
without
being
fruity
personally
though
i
did
not
care
for
this
beer
and
would
not
buy
it
again
id
order
a
pbr
over
it
because
at
least
i
can
be
sure
its
beer
what
a
wonderful
tasting
beer
a
golden
crisp
color
and
taste
wonderful
from
the
beinging
to
the
end
shocktop
has
come
up
with
a
another
winner
just
smooth
thick
slky
beer
enjoy
this
beer
once
you
start
you
cant
stop
great
beer
a
great
bourbon
wheat
with
some
vanilla
that
leaes
you
gasping
for
more
o
smells
nice
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
taste
not
as
bad
as
anticipated
just
a
rather
benign
wheat
beer
a
tasty
refreshing
belgian
white
beer
before
real
craft
beers
opened
my
eyes
this
was
my
original
craft
beer
smells
like
orangecitrus
and
grassy
it
is
kind
of
heavy
tasting
with
citrus
accents
not
my
favorite
had
an
almost
sour
aftertaste
im
generally
not
much
of
a
fan
of
the
taste
of
unfiltered
beers
ive
had
with
this
not
being
an
exception
not
sure
what
the
problem
is
with
this
beer
yeah
i
know
its
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
but
not
everything
they
do
is
immediately
terrible
had
this
at
buffalo
wild
wings
and
i
gotta
say
this
beer
goes
perfect
with
spicy
food
it
doesnt
have
any
really
strong
flavors
and
its
not
bitter
at
all
slightly
sweet
and
very
carbonated
it
goes
down
almost
like
water
itd
be
great
for
mowing
the
lawn
or
going
out
on
a
boat
or
maybe
for
cookouts
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
absolutely
nothing
special
going
on
here
awful
overall
the
taste
makes
me
want
to
vomit
it
is
most
definitely
two
notches
under
most
wheat
beers
on
the
market
it
features
a
complicated
medicinal
chemical
blend
of
citrus
flavors
poor
look
too
loses
its
head
of
foam
quickly
and
looks
flat
thereafter
this
beer
is
poor
at
best
nice
color
poor
everything
else
this
beer
wants
to
be
bells
oberon
and
others
like
it
but
falls
on
its
face
like
most
macrobrews
a
good
citrus
flavored
beer
essentially
the
same
beer
as
blue
moon
belgian
white
only
difference
is
that
this
beer
makes
me
sick
idk
what
it
is
what
anheuserbusch
products
but
there
is
something
they
use
that
makes
my
stomach
sick
a
little
darker
and
more
cloudy
than
a
regular
bud
so
they
made
an
attempt
tasty
alternative
to
blue
moon
gotta
4
pack
of
pint
cans
for
6
bucks
works
for
me
seriously
an
even
worst
rip
off
of
blue
moon
slight
orange
flavor
full
body
that
can
fill
you
up
not
at
all
watery
great
white
ale
and
affordable
too
beer
is
great
smooth
had
one
earlier
today
with
burrito
excellent
shock
top
belgium
white
irnva
nice
beer
crisp
and
clean
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
good
for
a
hot
day
or
to
drink
with
spicy
food
better
with
lemon
lime
orange
wedge
added
to
it
would
buy
again
they
just
started
carrying
this
at
the
local
olive
garden
it
is
tasty
and
i
like
the
way
it
looks
cloudy
with
character
its
very
smooth
beer
with
a
nice
but
minimal
citrus
taste
if
you
like
a
smooth
beer
with
some
character
this
is
pretty
good
stuff
if
you
think
your
beer
needs
to
taste
like
a
hops
covered
shoe
dipped
in
alcohol
and
with
dirt
added
for
color
this
isnt
going
to
cut
it
decent
belgian
white
dont
love
it
dont
hate
it
overall
not
a
bad
beer
middle
of
the
road
decent
and
completely
drinkable
i
kinda
like
it
great
wheat
beer
more
suited
to
casual
drinking
with
friends
in
the
alley
than
with
a
meal
a
buy
from
time
to
time
shows
a
little
cloudy
but
a
nice
smooth
beer
the
description
provided
says
it
all
the
citrus
flavors
arent
overwhelming
light
feel
to
it
would
be
bothered
to
have
it
again
horrible
if
you
havent
found
craft
beer
yet
then
drink
a
blue
moon
over
this
the
best
of
what
was
available
at
a
concert
cheers
just
a
big
cup
of
meh
its
not
bad
i
wouldnt
call
it
swill
but
its
certainly
not
special
or
notable
in
any
way
serving
type
bottle
very
very
generic
a
little
too
generic
i
had
this
with
and
without
an
orange
with
the
orange
i
primarily
tasted
the
orange
and
very
little
of
the
beer
itself
it
was
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
without
the
orange
and
overall
i
found
the
beer
less
than
average
i
could
taste
the
citrus
and
coriander
which
gave
it
an
earthy
tone
but
unfortunately
it
just
wasnt
all
that
great
love
me
some
shock
top
surprise
to
the
tastebuds
great
all
season
drink
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
price
but
it
lacks
something
i
expect
in
a
belgian
white
i
think
its
lack
of
yeast
flavor
o
you
could
easily
drink
34
of
these
can
be
refreshing
if
you
didnt
mind
the
lack
of
beer
taste
it
tastes
mass
produced
if
that
makes
sense
this
is
so
much
better
than
some
of
the
other
beers
in
this
category
light
clean
tasty
good
taste
better
with
an
orange
o
about
the
same
as
blue
moon
but
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
mix
between
a
witbier
and
an
adjunct
lager
a
little
crisper
though
buy
whichever
is
cheapest
not
good
avoid
at
all
costs
i
dont
get
the
vitriol
for
this
beer
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
its
just
not
a
great
beer
is
it
a
legitimate
belgian
beer
of
course
not
but
budweiser
isnt
really
a
legitimate
lager
so
ill
judge
it
on
its
taste
alone
pretty
good
not
bad
overall
this
beer
is
certainly
below
par
but
what
was
i
really
expecting
anyway
i
got
it
just
because
and
i
regretted
it
from
start
to
finish
i
would
never
order
this
again
period
2

68
c
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
well
my
options
tonight
were
the
ubiquitous
american
light
pale
lagers
and
this
it
was
inoffensive
and
satisfying
for
the
place
i
was
at
its
anheiserbuschs
craft
line
and
honestly
feels
like
they
tasted
blue
moon
and
went
oh
yeah
well
here
really
not
much
to
this
one
some
grainy
and
citrus
elements
particularly
orange
light
and
simple
beyond
that
little
depth
flavor
and
complexity
i
simply
wanted
to
at
least
try
this
one
now
that
ive
done
that
i
have
decided
that
once
is
quite
enough
pours
with
a
small
white
head
is
golden
in
color
and
very
murky
has
aromas
of
citrus
from
brewed
peels
and
wheat
that
combine
to
create
and
alright
smell
initial
taste
is
strong
with
coriander
but
not
too
strong
orange
and
like
combine
to
create
a
finishing
flavor
overall
taste
is
alright
a
right
in
the
middle
beer
i
tried
a
sample
on
tap
and
did
not
order
it
i
do
not
like
orange
beer
at
all
you
dont
exactly
know
by
the
name
but
it
is
an
orange
beer
refreshing
and
light
body
this
beer
nearly
made
me
quit
drinking
beer
for
ever
had
it
in
a
can
no
less
steer
clear
overall
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
which
is
relatively
free
of
the
astringent
corn
flavour
that
is
present
in
most
of
their
other
beers
i
usually
like
ipas
and
i
was
kinda
disappointed
to
find
out
this
was
made
by
them
but
i
have
to
say
that
this
has
a
consistent
drinkability
and
enough
flavor
to
make
it
above
average
the
first
time
i
had
it
i
liked
it
then
the
next
case
flavor
seemed
to
become
dull
and
non
appeeling
to
me
i
havent
liked
any
of
the
shock
top
brand
beers
taste
like
skunky
beer
i
see
this
at
the
store
every
time
ive
only
bought
this
1
time
i
wonder
however
why
it
has
such
poor
ratings
on
ba
its
a
bit
dark
for
the
style
ill
say
that
and
perhaps
the
head
retention
and
lacing
could
be
a
little
better
but
i
still
think
its
pretty
good
for
the
style
its
a
bit
malty
mainly
wheaty
in
the
aroma
but
theres
still
some
coriander
to
it
as
well
as
orange
peel
and
all
of
that
carries
into
the
flavor
as
well
its
rounded
and
balanced
it
might
be
fuller
than
id
expect
but
there
are
other
american
breweries
doing
the
same
blue
moon
is
much
heavier
and
scores
better
and
there
are
a
lot
of
brewpubs
and
smaller
micros
in
the
same
boat
besides
all
of
that
its
clean
and
consistent
i
think
its
just
getting
a
bad
rap
here
because
its
made
by
ab
overall
nice
beer
for
a
a
party
light
and
easy
to
drink
belgian
white
has
a
stale
wheat
like
flavor
very
odd
off
tastes
and
is
very
watery
overall
pretty
nasty
bland
beer
basically
water
with
a
bit
of
beer
mixed
in
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
style
wheat
beers
but
this
one
is
just
hohum
its
not
terrible
but
its
definitely
not
remarkable
taste
is
grainy
with
a
slight
spicebitterness
to
it
on
the
backend
very
watery
and
lightly
carbonated
serviceable
as
a
witbier
but
not
one
of
the
better
ones
so
would
i
recommend
it
sure
its
refreshing
and
doesnt
have
a
bad
taste
at
all
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
belgium
style
there
is
much
better
if
you
are
looking
for
a
smelly
beer
this
one
is
not
for
you
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
that
have
some
guts
this
one
is
not
for
you
either
overall
if
you
drink
a
shock
top
belgian
and
think
youve
tried
a
wit
youve
been
mislead
this
is
the
second
beer
i
feel
like
pouring
today
its
a
sad
example
of
a
great
style
try
hoegaarden
or
blue
moon
for
a
much
better
example
of
how
witbier
should
be
the
spices
and
and
peel
tastes
are
not
very
evident
in
this
beer
but
overall
a
good
drinkable
white
a
standard
you
see
a
lot
of
places
and
it
really
hits
the
okay
rating
pretty
spot
on
not
great
but
not
terrible
either
appearance
is
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
a
lot
of
orange
peel
and
other
citrus
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
lot
of
orange
and
then
a
little
bit
of
wheat
and
yeast
underneath
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
overall
a
beer
i
wont
say
no
to
but
probably
wont
be
picking
up
a
case
anytime
soon
im
surprised
at
the
low
rating
i
always
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
certainly
no
paulaner
but
its
a
decent
wheat
beer
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
remind
me
of
tomato
soup
i
like
tomato
soup
but
it
is
not
what
im
looking
for
in
my
beer
poor
imitation
of
a
belgian
white
watery
imitation
of
blue
moon
even
when
the
blue
moon
white
is
a
poor
beer
i
have
a
fondness
for
bluemoon
as
it
was
my
notice
of
the
idea
of
craft
beer
and
the
existence
other
beers
other
than
adjunct
lagers
ive
found
that
drinking
st
from
the
bottle
and
following
the
directions
on
the
bottle
on
how
to
pour
into
a
glass
makes
a
big
difference
especially
if
you
add
a
slice
of
orange
to
the
glass
still
a
fairly
weak
macrobrew
but
better
than
your
typical
bud
or
miller
swill
ive
had
much
worse
beers
than
this
some
so
bad
that
i
had
to
pour
them
down
the
drain
this
beer
is
disappointing
as
a
white
ale
but
definitely
not
drain
pour
i
wouldnt
spend
money
on
it

the
taste
very

the

feel
was

with

i

both
without

with
both
are

i
found
with

the
beer
became

because
when
all
is
said
and
done
not
mine
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
may
not
be
everyones
taste
it
isnt
your
standard
wit
but
its
good
in
its
own
way
this
is
my
second
time
drinking
this
beer
this
week
and
both
times
i
seem
to
get
this
wierd
stomach
ache
expired
no
way
to
tell
since
there
is
no
date
on
other
occasions
ive
had
this
it
has
been
more
palatable
if
i
reviewed
this
when
i
had
it
last
year
it
would
be
a
solid
3
this
time
i
didnt
enjoy
it
at
all
o
i
say
its
not
bad
i
kind
of
like
it
because
its
easy
drinking
i
would
serve
it
and
recommend
it
if
you
havent
tried
it
have
one
and
lets
talk
about
it
i
was
impressed
with
the
good
gold
color
of
the
beer
these
belgians
dont
always
impress
me
with
their
hue
but
this
one
looks
good
unfortunately
little
to
no
head
and
no
staying
power
but
it
was
a
very
bright
white
color
ill
give
it
that
i
also
liked
the
soothing
wheat
smell
mixed
in
with
hops
it
was
just
right
the
carbonation
was
just
right
and
the
taste
was
exactly
what
i
smelled
which
is
a
big
plus
up
for
me
overall
i
was
impressed
it
was
smooth
and
refreshing
while
packing
a
decent
punch
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
smells
like
oj
tastes
like
watereddown
oj
unpleasant
lingering
aftertaste
it
pales
in
comparison
to
other
similar
brews
including
blue
moon
which
is
average
at
best
in
my
opinion
surprised
to
see
it
was
over
5
abv
would
not
buy
it
again
although
the
real
reason
i
bought
it
is
because
ft
sam
has
it
for
12
50
a
case
and
i
couldnt
pass
up
a
deal
like
that
keep
it
cold
and
its
a
great
beer
for
a
105
degree
day
here
in
south
texas
i
wouldnt
pay
much
more
than
that
for
it
but
when
its
cheaper
than
pabst
o
a
pretty
poor
attempt
by
anheuserbusch
at
creating
a
belgian
wit
macro
brew
although
that
being
said
its
really
not
that
bad
its
very
drinkable
it
just
doesnt
really
match
the
style
well
i
will
give
it
to
anheuserbusch
though
that
this
is
better
then
the
canadian
macrobrewed
failed
attempts
at
a
witbeer
by
rickards
and
alexander
keiths
carbonations
mild
mouthfeels
fine
and
would
i
drink
it
again
maybe
if
i
was
lost
in
the
desert
and
could
not
expel
enough
urine
to
drink
i
really
like
the
shock
top
raspberry
wheat
so
tried
this
thinking
it
would
be
the
orange
peel
version
but
it
was
disappointing
it
was
just
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
i
drank
it
and
it
wasnt
unpleasant
but
nothing
worth
crowing
about
no
hint
of
the
orange
flavor
i
was
expecting
o
this
is
worse
than
i
remember
it
being
and
i
remember
really
not
liking
it
it
essentially
tastes
like
an
orange
extract
mimed
coriander
and
almost
wheat
flavored
budweiser
which
is
very
marketable
but
not
very
good
o
in
a
bit
of
harsh
honesty
i
wasnt
expecting
a
whole
lot
from
this
and
anheuserbusch
didnt
do
a
great
job
of
changing
my
mind
while
its
certainly
not
the
worst
beer
ive
had
its
definitely
low
on
the
list
it
just
comes
off
too
i
dont
know
artificial
tasting
i
suppose
this
beer
is
acceptable
if
your
only
other
choices
are
light
beers
or
if
youre
trying
to
open
to
door
for
someone
to
stray
away
from
light
beers
otherwise
its
best
to
leave
this
one
on
the
shelf
some
people
like
this
stuff
but
its
way
too
bland
for
me
the
flavor
itself
isnt
awful
with
the
ornage
added
but
its
too
dank
and
sour
to
be
enjoyable
its
a
beer
people
might
enjoy
but
it
doesnt
fit
the
style
it
claims
to
be
on
the
whole
i
actually
really
enjoyed
this
it
tasted
like
a
nice
entry
level
lactobased
sour
for
10
a
pitcher
ill
drink
a
decent
sour
all
night
o
its
not
bad
i
think
they
were
trying
to
be
like
blue
moon
too
much
blue
moon
is
better
by
the
way
but
this
one
isnt
bad
and
you
can
have
a
few
of
them
in
a
session
just
fine
o
acceptable
flavor
and
aroma
except
for
bring
very
light
and
timid
what
a
terrible
beer
ill
admit
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beerswhite
beers
to
begin
with
but
there
are
some
that
i
enjoy
just
not
this
one
quite
possibly
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
o
good
beer
for
the
neophyte
branching
out
from
macros
i
can
think
of
dozens
of
better
values
for
my
beer
money
this
again
is
similar
to
my
favorite
beer
blue
moon
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
have
had
it
both
from
bottles
and
on
tap
it
has
a
light
golden
appearance
with
a
citrus
style
flavor
little
head
but
the
head
that
is
there
is
a
creamy
light
head
this
beer
is
also
great
with
a
orange
in
it
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
sampled
needless
to
say
i
will
avoid
at
all
costs
great
for
a
summer
day
not
too
high
of
an
abv
combined
with
the
sweetness
makes
it
a
good
beer
when
the
suns
out
and
youre
playing
beach
volleyball
or
at
a
graduation
party
the
beer
pours
a
nice
white
head
with
a
gold
tone
and
cloudy
appearance
the
beer
had
a
nice
wheat
flavor
with
hints
of
caramel
coriander
orange
and
lemon
the
flavor
dissipates
quickly
therefore
the
beer
is
too
light
and
lacks
lasting
flavor
it
would
be
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
with
its
light
slight
refreshing
flavors
o
overall
it
was
pretty
average
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
it
isnt
putrid
vomit
like
some
close
minded
bas
who
arent
open
to
opinions
other
than
the
code
of
beer
snobbery
those
guys
can
gettt
out

hazey

orange
color
white

nice

taste
not
overly
carbonated
mouth
feel
is

there
are
instructions
on
puring
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
give
it
a
little
swirl
before
emptying
the
whole
bottle
in
the
glass
not
to
bad
of
a
beer
nice
summer
party
beer
i
would
put
some
in
the
cooler
for
camping
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weissevase
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
pale
yelloworange
coloring
with
a
steady
flow
of
carbonation
throughout
and
no
head
on
top
aromas
of
toasted
grain
a
dash
of
citrus
sweet
and
not
much
else
you
really
have
to
go
crashing
in
there
with
your
nose
to
find
anything
flavors
of
roasted
grain
citrus
highlights
and
a
touch
of
clove
spicing
all
on
a
bready
backbone
flavors
are
subtle
and
slightly
weak
compared
to
the
smooth
midbody
feel
in
mouth
the
carbonation
leads
to
a
quick
filmy
slightly
sharp
finish
after
a
muddled
semisweet
aftertaste
not
good
a
great
beer
that
has
a
good
citrusy
after
taste
before
you
drink
this
be
sure
to
swirl
and
carefuly
tip
upside
down
to
mix
properly
to
get
all
the
flavors
this
is
a
beer
for
seahawks
fans
cause
this
is
all
we
drink
at
century
link
feild
lets
go
hawks
overall
very
good
but
not
the
equal
of
best
imports
or
sierra
nevada
kellerweis
o
a
pretty
good
showing
makes
you
wonder
why
anheuserbusch
made
golden
wheat
when
they
already
had
this
id
buy
it
if
its
cheap
but
not
likely
to
happen
when
theres
oberon
blue
moon
sunset
wheat
and
hoegaarden
around
most
of
the
time
instead
its
not
something
i
would
ever
willfully
select
but
at
a
nascar
race
it
was
a
spot
of
fun
compared
to
the
other
options
bud
coors
and
bud
light
light
effervescent
body
malt
sweetness
with
a
big
tangerine
flavor
tastes
like
orange
soda
with
unfermented
malt
extract
added
a
the
faintest
whisp
of
wheat
really
a
lot
worse
than
i
remember
havent
had
it
in
a
couple
years
worse
than
blue
moon
and
i
dont
like
that
either
overly
sweet
and
reminiscent
of
soda
overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
it
is
not
too
strong
at
5
2
abv
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavour
and
a
nice
scent
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
but
not
bad
at
all
worth
a
try
and
is
a
real
allseason
beer
drink
i
didnt
have
to
pay
for
this
it
was
free
so
oh
well
they
cant
all
be
wales
o
something
for
the
average
bmc
to
enjoy
and
break
out
from
their
standard
beers
from
but
not
my
thing
it
could
be
a
good
lawnmower
or
porch
beer
but
it
was
forgettable
for
me
pretty
watery
and
bland
overall
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
straw
golden
colour
that
disipates
rather
quickly
smells
off
orange
zest
and
ketchup
why
ketchup
tastes
like
campbells
tomato
soup
with
crackers
aftertase
is
nice
though
with
an
orange
zesty
flavour
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
a
beer
ill
never
be
drinking
again
i
dont
see
it
as
much
buttery
though
i
think
the
citrus
counterbalances
that
with
tartness
its
a
good
beer
but
its
better
in
a
glass
this
tastes
like
butter
yeah
actual
butter
honey
boo
boo
would
love
this
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
whiteswith
that
said
this
isnt
my
favorite
although
im
a
big
fan
great
taste
and
scent
on
this
one
a
slice
of
orange
compliments
it
well
im
just
starting
to
experiment
with
beers
so
we
shall
see
how
my
opinion
changes
after
time
two
thumbs
up
the
verdict
not
bad
for
an
anheuserbusch
offering
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
im
in
a
place
that
only
offers
macrobrews
ill
take
it
over
a
blue
moon
any
day
i
have
no
idea
how
this
got
popular
its
a
brutal
representation
of
a
style
of
beer
that
i
adore
the
pour
from
the
tap
into
my
pint
glass
is
cloudy
and
artifically
orange
with
a
ton
of
thick
sediment
suspended
within
and
about
an
inch
of
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
looks
real
nasty
when
its
gone
the
nose
is
okay
some
fruity
yeast
and
a
ton
of
orange
zest
almost
like
an
orange
juice
beer
from
concentrate
of
course
the
nose
and
the
taste
are
both
rather
floral
which
i
cant
explain
the
yeast
is
fruity
but
generic
lacking
the
real
light
bright
white
feel
and
taste
i
expect
in
a
wit
way
too
thick
in
body
for
the
style
too
even
though
this
is
relatively
easy
drinking
enough
carbonation
to
cut
through
the
heavy
sediment
but
no
equilibrium
is
reached
and
this
remains
an
unbalanced
glass
of
mass
produced
wash
i
woulnt
recommend
this
to
anyone
and
it
kills
me
that
this
is
the
witbier
that
bars
carry
and
that
the
average
drinker
thinks
is
some
sorft
of
craft
item
its
moderately
better
in
a
bottle
i
reckon
but
on
tap
this
is
offensive
looks
light
with
a
haze
and
almost
an
artificial
fizzy
top
the
smell
is
orange
mist
and
watermemories
of
walters
sprayed
produce
come
to
mind
its
edible
and
creamy
compared
to
its
riceadjunct
counterparts
far
from
great
but
equally
as
far
from
terrible
you
can
definitely
wash
down
cheap
american
eats
with
this
here
shocktop
theres
not
much
feel
to
speak
of
but
maybe
a
bit
of
effervescence
off
the
orangey
citrusy
carbonation
at
least
its
not
a
fraud
www
brewreviewboston
blogspot
com
exceptionally
unimpressive
i
dont
know
how
people
like
it
overall
a
beer
for
people
who
dont
know
much
about
craft
and
mistake
this
flavor
for
being
good
beer
taste
overall
what
a
terrible
disservice
to
the
witbier
style
most
are
light
but
this
is
ridiculous
makes
blue
moon
taste
like
allagash
by
comparison
o
runofthemill
wheat
ale
this
poured
with
a
one
finger
head
that
seemed
to
never
leave
orangish
yellow
in
color
it
had
a
nice
citrus
aroma
but
had
a
faint
malt
scent
in
the
background
very
carbonated
in
your
mouth
it
had
a
very
light
feel
with
a
tangerine
flavor
theres
a
hint
of
malt
and
citrus
and
a
relatively
light
easy
drinking
flavor
much
better
than
i
expected
overall
a
beer
that
can
be
easily
drank
it
was
horrible
but
i
have
had
better
witbiers
overall
its
an
ab
product
and
it
shows
i
would
love
it
if
these
guys
would
actually
make
a
craft
beer
that
could
compete
on
its
own
merits
instead
of
relying
on
packaging
and
advertising
i
have
had
this
beer
both
on
tap
and
bottled
in
both
cases
it
has
been
superior
to
many
belgian
whites
brewed
by
microbreweries
it
is
certainly
not
hoegaarden
but
it
is
half
the
price
it
goes
down
really
easy
and
like
all
good
white
beers
it
is
a
real
treat
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
puts
a
smile
on
my
face
this
offering
pours
a
cloudy
straw
with
a
huge
four
finger
head
no
lacing
is
observed
smell
is
the
strongest
point
with
oranges
grass
bread
and
maybe
some
cinnamon
detected
mouthfeel
is
about
average
taste
is
the
low
point
it
is
extremely
sweet
with
no
hoppiness
on
the
finish
to
balance
it
out
i
dont
mind
a
good
wheat
beer
but
this
one
ill
pass
on
should
it
come
my
way
again
i
poured
this
odd
looking
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
cloudy
blond
looking
that
poured
a
nice
big
white
head
for
about
two
minutes
then
it
was
the
flatest
looking
beer
i
have
ever
seen
no
lacing
at
all
either
the
beer
had
kinda
of
citrus
taste
to
it
and
really
for
a
summer
beer
was
pretty
nice
i
was
stunned
i
would
actually
drink
it
again
but
just
dont
por
it
in
a
glass
this
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
yellow
with
no
head
or
lace
the
aroma
is
of
lemons
with
a
hint
of
dough
and
oranges
the
flavor
is
lemony
with
honey
orange
and
vanilla
notes
its
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
shock
top
belgian
white
is
a
good
beer
recommended
i
poured
this
one
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
pale
orange
color
body
with
a
fizy
head
that
basicilly
vanished
the
smell
is
light
of
wheat
and
spice
the
taste
is
has
slight
orange
flavor
to
it
but
not
much
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
is
a
easy
drinker
very
light
not
too
much
carbonation
nice
on
the
mouth
and
easily
drinkable
better
than
most
macro
whites
i
tried
the
beer
after
seeing
your
orange
vw
with
the
mohawk
parked
in
a
local
shopping
center
parking
lot
i
was
so
intrigued
i
stopped
at
the
local
market
and
bought
a
six
pack
since
i
had
already
attended
a
wine
tasting
party
that
afternoon
im
not
sure
the
beer
got
a
fair
shake
ill
try
it
again
tomorrow
night
and
give
you
another
review
the
car
is
awesome
the
spout
on
the
back
is
the
icing
on
the
cake
im
quite
hesitant
to
let
this
beer
warm
up
feel
it
will
get
a
fair
bit
worse
cold
it
is
refreshing
despite
the
sourness
in
the
taste
but
there
are
so
much
many
better
witbiers
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
this
is
satisfactory
for
the
novice
palate
but
you
wouldnt
waste
your
time
on
it
if
you
know
any
better
that
being
said
if
there
wasnt
anything
else
to
drink
id
have
one
of
these
and
wouldnt
feel
like
i
was
suffering
its
drinkable
but
mediocre
i
drink
this
at
restaurants
when
i
dont
want
a
local
utah
brew
its
okay
the
orange
taste
taste
artificial
when
i
think
about
it
but
when
i
just
drink
it
its
okay
it
has
a
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
drink
this
any
day
actually
o
this
just
feels
like
it
should
be
called
bug
light
with
orange
there
is
nothing
here
to
set
it
apart
from
the
mass
produced
beers
if
your
other
options
are
the
usual
selection
of
macro
beers
then
this
would
be
another
choice
but
even
then
there
is
nothing
special
here
i
got
a
sixer
of
these
downed
them
within
2
hours
and
i
doubt
ill
go
back
to
it
unless
im
buying
something
quickly
at
a
small
service
station

55
remainder
poured
down
the
drain
taste
is
pleasant
light
but
full
grain
with
hitn
of
coriander
mineral
and
vague
light
citrusy
zest
and
a
lightly
doughy
finish
it
is
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
it
has
a
pretty
good
feel
slightly
oily
yet
lively
it
is
reasonably
enjoyable
if
very
basic
and
a
bit
crude
although
this
is
a
corporate
beer
its
not
terrible
poured
into
pint
glass
good
straw
colored
appearance
with
a
decent
head
notes
of
orange
and
a
bit
spicy
quick
drinking
beer
you
can
down
several
of
these
fairly
quickly
obviously
no
ones
first
choice
as
a
craft
beer
drinker
but
in
a
pinch
a
better
choice
than
some
other
mega
offerings
o
this
is
another
crap
beer
from
anhieser
busch
they
cheap
out
on
the
wheat
and
the
hops
and
make
a
beer
that
is
way
too
sweet
without
the
presence
of
a
belgian
yeast
strain
figures
tasteorange
with
a
twist
of
coriander
this
beer
was
basically
your
typical
cheap
quasicraft
offering
from
a
large
brewing
corporation
i
would
drink
it
again
if
handed
one
i
even
tried
pouring
all
the
sediment
in
which
really
made
no
difference
at
all
its
just
a
very
plain
witbier
decent
summer
wheat
in
a
pinch
if
there
is
nothing
better
on
tap
at
your
local
pub
two
finger
white
well
retained
head
on
a
hazy
yellow
body
good
retention
and
lace
scent
and
taste
is
wheat
and
orange
peel
with
some
coriander
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
not
bad
overall
definitely
one
of
my
top
favorite
its
light
smooth
refreshing
and
not
overbearing
overall
easy
drinking
and
affordable
it
has
some
nice
characteristics
and
makes
for
a
good
session
brew
overall
this
might
be
a
good
introduction
into
the
world
of
witbiers
but
i
would
move
on
quickly
there
are
much
better
examples
out
there
final
thoughts
this
strikes
me
as
a
good
benchmark
for
a
generic
tasting
witbier
nothing
here
is
going
to
wow
you
but
it
doesnt
really
do
anything
wrong
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
do
so
again
if
it
was
priced
similar
to
a
normal
macro
offering
drinkability
very
simple
witbier
with
a
ton
of
orange
peel
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
can
certainly
do
better
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
there
is
a
hint
of
belgian
spicy
yeast
on
the
nose
but
it
is
very
muted
like
someone
dropped
a
single
clove
in
my
glass
i
can
just
barely
smell
it
i
also
get
a
stale
sugar
aroma
it
reminds
me
of
a
7up
that
has
been
left
on
the
counter
all
day
the
taste
is
flaccid
i
get
a
touch
of
coriander
but
more
of
that
stale
soda
flavor
that
i
got
on
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
and
soda
like
i
am
sure
it
would
be
really
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
overall
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
on
a
hot
day
i
would
drink
it
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
o
a
decent
beer
for
a
changeup
but
nothing
im
rushing
back
to
o
its
a
beer
that
is
trying
to
do
something
different
but
just
doesnt
quite
have
it
just
yet
no
yeast
so
its
not
a
real
witbier
would
i
have
again
unsure
appearance
lightly
hazed
pale
yellow
body
with
a
tall
somewhat
lasting
white
head
smell
rather
scant
hints
at
pale
malts
and
malted
wheat
before
some
slightly
bolder
but
still
very
very
mild
notes
of
clove
and
orange
peel
taste
pale
malts
swing
towards
a
slightly
tangy
malted
wheat
with
a
mild
subtle
sweetness
medium
carbonation
dry
finish
mouthfeel
thinbodied
medium
though
airy
carbonation
drinkability
not
recommended
the
best
part
of
the
beer
is
the
aroma
but
the
taste
is
too
thin
and
evaporates
after
just
a
second
or
two
very
unsatisfying
its
not
offensive
because
it
doesnt
taste
or
smell
like
anything
im
curious
which
spices
it
was
brewed
with
because
none
of
them
come
through
overall
the
high
carbonation
and
the
attention
to
sweet
orange
flavor
and
not
true
citrus
orange
flavor
make
this
beer
more
akin
to
a
soda
that
a
beer
let
alone
a
belgian
witbier
style
it
pours
just
fine
but
the
lack
of
pleasant
aromas
and
the
sweetness
make
this
not
very
drinkable
i
would
rather
have
either
a
soda
or
a
beer
but
not
a
sodabeer
i
have
to
agree
with
the
previous
reviewer
the
orange
smell
seemed
on
the
verge
of
going
bad
the
color
was
weak
and
the
overall
taste
of
the
beer
was
weak
just
not
enjoyable
to
drink
plus
for
some
reason
budwiser
products
seem
to
give
me
the
worse
ha
about
half
way
through
a
bottle
of
beer
honestly
i
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
no
go
drinkability
repeatable
all
day
long
this
is
a
good
summer
session
beer
it
provides
an
interesting
flavor
shock
to
the
tongue
without
being
overly
bitter
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
price
to
value
ratio
id
buy
it
again
o
this
is
the
beer
that
i
default
to
if
theres
nothing
else
it
is
not
by
any
means
something
i
would
pick
up
on
its
own
merit
a
beer
of
last
resort
if
you
will
o
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
but
not
horrible
simple
and
drinkable
overall
the
shock
top
belgian
white
is
a
utility
beer
suitable
for
fast
and
inattentive
drinking
there
is
not
much
complexity
to
the
beer
that
makes
it
worth
savouring
the
taste
mouthfeel
and
aroma
reminds
us
that
it
is
brewed
and
bottled
in
new
york
not
munich
or
frankfurt
on
the
pour
it
leaves
a
very
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
thin
spotty
lacing
that
also
absent
after
a
few
minutes
the
taste
provides
a
hint
of
orange
and
lime
with
slight
maltiness
the
smell
is
a
bit
metallic
as
is
the
taste
and
there
is
also
an
aroma
of
malt
that
is
not
followed
up
on
the
palate
the
texturemouth
feel
is
thin
and
slightly
syrupy
the
beer
sports
an
even
golden
cloudiness
and
a
fluid
spray
of
mild
carbonation
overall
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
the
beer
or
notable
in
a
positive
or
negative
sense
it
is
definitely
less
passionate
and
of
lower
caste
than
german
weissbier
however
when
considered
against
its
true
comparators
domestic
beer
it
holds
its
own
as
a
tasty
thirstquencher
i
wrote
this
review
as
i
drank
the
beer
poured
from
a
can
into
a
beer
mug
can
was
previously
chilled
around
40
degrees
celcius
thanks
for
reading
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
in
general
but
im
really
not
a
fan
of
this
overall
its
2
am
and
the
beer
store
is
closed
this
is
one
of
your
best
options
at
the
gas
station
or
wal
mart
stay
away
o
overall
this
really
isnt
bad
its
a
definite
average
if
i
had
the
choice
between
this
or
bud
light
coors
light
etc
i
would
go
with
this
the
bottle
graphic
although
funny
and
appealing
at
first
made
me
feel
stupid
holding
it
after
a
while
this
beer
is
shite
from
a
crafted
standpoint
o
basically
a
cheap
imitation
of
a
proper
witbier
honestly
its
not
bad
just
a
bit
too
sweet
with
too
much
artificial
orange
having
said
that
if
im
going
with
a
cheap
witbier
id
much
rather
have
a
blue
moon
i
really
like
this
belgian
white
it
has
the
appearance
of
what
you
would
expect
with
its
style
smell
though
threw
me
a
little
hopping
for
a
little
more
citrus
notes
beings
it
is
advertised
on
bottle
but
the
beer
has
great
taste
easy
to
drink
anytime
i
would
buy
another
6
pack
of
it
overall
a
very
drinkable
and
nearly
flavorless
beer
beats
a
bitter
light
beer
when
only
run
if
the
mill
beers
are
available
but
still
it
that
great
rjt
o
this
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
but
could
be
a
lot
better
if
it
cut
back
on
some
of
the
malty
and
sweet
flavors
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
they
have
recipes
on
their
website
to
cook
with
and
the
chicken
with
angel
hair
pasta
tastes
amazing
odi
can
see
why
a
bunch
of
people
who
dont
really
dabble
outside
of
the
bud
light
genre
enjoy
this
one
far
from
offensive
and
quite
easy
drinking
wont
be
spending
my
money
on
this
but
it
could
have
turned
out
far
worse
overall
ugh
barely
even
tastes
like
beer
let
alone
a
witbier
never
would
have
bought
this
to
begin
with
so
thank
god
i
didnt
d
overall
its
not
bad
for
a
macrobrew
but
its
definitely
not
in
the
same
class
as
most
of
the
craft
beers
brewed
today
didnt
try
it
with
an
orange
as
im
not
sure
it
would
enhance
flavors
or
aromas
o
not
expecting
much
with
ab
and
i
was
correct
even
comparing
it
to
blue
moon
its
not
that
impressive
overall
one
of
the
more
refreshing
beers
out
there
very
drinkable
but
a
punch
of
fruity
flavor
its
a
shame
that
most
beers
out
there
are
either
fruity
or
not
fruity
and
i
have
yet
to
find
a
beer
that
has
middleground
this
beer
comes
close
to
that
medium
and
is
an
overall
good
beer
overall
a
good
beer
and
i
am
once
again
impressed
by
this
ab
offering
i
took
notes
on
my
phone
so
im
not
writing
this
as
i
drink
it
o
drinkable
but
not
very
good
blue
moon
is
much
better
if
i
want
a
shitty
belgian
white
really
not
that
bad
for
a
bmc
product
tryin
to
be
a
classic
belgium
style
but
still
has
the
mouthfeel
of
a
watered
down
lager
and
the
big
slice
of
orange
that
i
got
with
mine
after
asking
for
no
orange
did
not
help
taste
has
some
notes
of
wheat
and
good
yeast
because
of
being
unfiltered
but
still
not
something
that
i
recommend
anyday
i
think
i
like
blue
moon
and
bud
light
golden
wheat
better
overall
not
a
beer
worth
paying
for
plenty
of
other
good
witbiers
out
there
worth
your
money
with
the
staleness
of
this
beer
it
just
falls
short
of
a
decent
brew
this
is
a
beer
worth
drinking
and
one
id
probably
like
more
if
i
had
it
more
it
looked
and
smelled
better
than
it
tasted
nice
rich
color
and
a
good
head
smell
was
a
little
fruity
but
mostly
malty
and
rich
it
just
tasted
plain
and
empty
there
was
some
good
bitterness
and
the
wheat
taste
was
obvious
but
it
wasnt
rich
or
all
that
impressive
this
is
i
guess
supposed
to
be
served
with
an
orange
wedge
which
i
didnt
have
i
can
see
how
that
would
have
helped
but
in
my
opinion
beer
shouldnt
need
outside
help
it
felt
pretty
dang
normal
medium
bodied
worth
having
but
not
impressed
paired
with
a
turkey
and
cheese
on
a
roll
sandwich
and
chips
after
i
got
to
the
second
glass
o
well
theres
not
much
to
say
but
that
this
is
an
adequate
beer
nothing
that
stands
out
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
especially
on
a
hot
day
o
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
sad
to
say
good
job
anheuserebusch
really
not
much
to
this
beer
a
shell
of
the
style
looks
dirty
but
comes
off
too
clean
i
prefer
my
whites
a
bit
dirty
with
some
fruitiness
and
yeast
flavors
nothing
of
the
sort
here
a
last
resort
beer
if
the
rest
to
chose
from
is
light
lagers
not
a
bad
wit
not
outstanding
but
worthy
this
is
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
no
noticeable
alcohol
so
very
sessionable
this
is
good
stuff
its
sort
of
creamy
i
know
its
some
type
of
knockoff
of
hoegaarden
or
belgian
style
wits
and
it
is
a
poor
watered
down
imitation
and
its
not
as
good
tonite
as
i
remembered
it
three
years
ago
but
with
an
orange
slice
and
and
hot
barmaids
pour
me
another
lass
not
bad
but
not
good
i
think
this
one
was
old
a
bleh
witbier
typical
overspiced
from
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
and
not
much
from
any
belgian
yeast
strain
o
coming
from
ab
this
isnt
a
bad
offering
there
are
certainly
better
witbiers
out
there
but
coming
from
a
large
brewer
this
is
a
decent
offering
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
shock
top
is
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
i
tend
to
overlook
megabreweries
when
im
searching
for
a
new
greattasting
beer
i
feel
like
they
are
all
about
production
and
not
so
interested
in
creating
innovative
flavorful
varieties
of
beer
thank
you
anheuserbusch
for
making
me
drink
my
words
ill
be
back
for
more
flavor
wise
nothing
exciting
yet
nothing
bad
just
lemon
orange
peel
spice
wheat
malt
and
yeast
over
all
just
an
average
witbier
nothing
offensive
just
average
but
it
is
very
drinkable
overall
i
like
shock
top
but
there
isnt
a
whole
lot
there
not
one
id
hunt
down
but
one
that
im
perfectly
content
with
drinking
i
normally
pair
this
or
blue
moon
with
wings
and
bbq
sauce
good
flavor
contrast
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
slightly
bland
flavours
and
aromas
overall
an
average
macro
version
of
a
belgian
witt
thats
about
it
shock
top
isnt
bad
id
rather
drink
this
than
some
watered
down
bud
it
pura
a
cloud
orange
similar
to
blue
moon
looks
like
a
wheat
beer
is
supposed
to
look
the
smell
is
nothing
too
special
light
citrus
and
malts
nothing
outstanding
the
flavor
is
slight
citrus
and
light
beer
overall
this
could
be
a
lot
worse
its
not
bad
the
bar
i
drink
at
has
it
for
50
cents
on
tap
on
mondays
for
that
price
i
drink
it
up
can
poured
a
slightly
hazy
light
orangey
color
ale
with
a
nice
foamy
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
is
more
pronounced
then
i
had
expected
and
quite
nice
taste
is
a
refreshing
mix
with
loads
of
orange
peel
notes
with
light
wheat
malt
base
body
is
light
for
style
with
good
carbonation
better
then
expected
though
malt
base
is
too
thin
and
watery
and
coriander
is
overshadowed
by
orange
peel
notes
o
easy
to
drink
its
not
outstanding
but
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
either
average
witbier
o
nothing
worth
getting
excited
over
and
the
synthetic
sweet
is
a
bit
distracting
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
but
i
dont
ever
really
need
to
drink
this
again
i
had
never
had
this
so
i
bought
a
six
to
try
out
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
with
a
light
head
that
disappears
quickly
has
a
pleasant
light
amber
color
taste
is
quite
citrusy
which
im
not
a
fan
of
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
not
bad
but
not
someting
i
would
buy
again
not
much
more
than
a
dressedup
macrobrew
i
think
i
actually
like
this
better
than
blue
moon
and
by
no
extension
at
all
rickards
white
but
damned
if
im
going
to
organize
a
comparative
tasting
anyways
this
is
enjoyable
enough
i
would
imagine
if
it
were
hot
and
sunny
and
there
were
no
better
preferably
proper
pilsbased
option
but
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
right
here
right
now
so
my
strictly
clinical
assessment
is
not
bad
for
the
price
but
like
its
craft
beer
wannabe
ilk
not
worth
the
dumbing
down
hit
to
ones
soul
o
enjoyable
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
bit
surprising
that
anheuserbusch
brewed
this
the
bud
of
witbiers
not
bad
looking
with
and
orange
tinge
to
a
cloudy
gold
brew
sizable
head
recedes
quickly
smell
is
orangey
with
note
of
wheat
malt
yeast
and
spices
taste
is
unimpressive
there
seems
to
be
orange
flavoring
as
well
as
spices
instead
of
the
traditional
citrus
that
comes
from
good
brewing
wheat
malt
is
present
and
give
it
something
to
enjoy
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
light
tartness
feel
is
light
and
lightly
carbonated
not
bad
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
more
of
this
blue
moon
is
a
much
better
macro
wit
comments
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
it
falls
short
in
a
few
areas
but
it
makes
up
for
it
with
its
unique
flavor
i
can
see
how
up
in
the
north
someone
would
try
it
and
not
be
convinced
by
its
qualities
but
if
you
were
down
in
houston
texas
with
me
experiencing
temperatures
consistently
over
100
degrees
it
sure
is
a
great
refreshing
wheat
ale
to
have
in
your
cooler
you
can
bash
it
in
many
places
but
its
drinkability
and
refreshing
flavor
make
it
a
good
bet
for
hot
summer
days
o
this
beer
is
nothing
special
but
i
have
to
give
it
to
ab
on
this
one
its
simple
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
its
a
goto
at
the
charlottesville
pavilion
for
fridays
after
five
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
fairly
light
and
quite
drinkable
although
there
are
many
better
summer
beers
out
there
not
huge
on
flavor
but
it
does
quench
your
thirst
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
a
little
bit
more
thickness
would
benefit
the
citrus
tastes
the
thinness
here
just
feels
a
little
unnatural
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
these
make
quite
the
good
summer
pounder
i
have
to
admit
that
overall
a
very
passable
brew
its
nothing
jawdropping
but
can
be
found
for
a
decent
price
is
highly
drinkable
and
can
now
be
found
in
cans
went
into
tasting
shock
top
with
open
taste
buds
and
still
was
surprised
not
all
that
impressive
to
look
at
in
a
glass
slightly
hazy
head
doesnt
last
little
stick
or
lacing
scent
is
only
slightly
reminiscent
of
wheat
some
citrus
taste
is
of
grain
just
sweet
enough
to
want
more
a
bit
of
citrus
and
wheat
little
if
any
hops
mouthfeel
is
neutral
this
beer
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
and
may
shock
some
people
sorry
about
that
got
carried
away
no
game
changers
here
but
a
solid
drinking
summer
beer
while
i
found
this
inoffensive
i
also
found
it
undrinkable
lots
of
white
foam
on
top
of
the
light
coloured
body
neutral
aroma
middling
though
aggressive
carbonation
something
orange
in
the
background
in
the
style
but
nothing
tasty
a
bit
of
a
gateway
beer
for
discerning
picky
palates
this
will
be
equivalent
to
covering
a
thirdrate
cut
of
meat
with
extra
salt
and
black
pepperi
e
an
obvious
bandaid
solution
i
have
no
doubt
however
that
many
will
think
this
beer
delicious
i
certainly
think
its
the
tastiest
beer
michelob
has
ever
put
out
and
will
reach
for
it
again
on
my
next
camping
trip
overall
not
overly
impressed
however
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
that
is
starting
to
venture
away
from
bmc
and
experiment
m
creamy
with
good
mouth
coating
aftertaste
of
wheat
is
good
downfall
over
carbonated
a
pretty
lame
witbier
drinkable
without
much
else
going
for
it
a
decent
lawnmower
brew
not
disgusting
just
not
really
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
i
cant
think
of
any
compelling
reason
to
get
this
again
especially
when
hoegaarden
is
almost
everywhere
i
got
this
beer
at
thestoretheother
day
igotin
bottleand
poured
into
pint
glass
the
first
thing
i
noticed
is
the
color
which
is
an
intense
yellow
which
is
very
pleasant
it
poured
nicely
with
a
one
inch
head
the
smell
is
fairly
fruity
and
taste
is
also
surprisingly
fruity
it
has
a
slight
spiced
taste
with
an
apricote
taste
to
it
i
did
not
care
for
it
that
much
it
is
a
nice
attempt
to
making
a
fruity
beer
im
sure
it
is
practical
for
the
summer
time
edit
i
didnt
even
realize
until
reviewing
here
that
it
was
a
subsidiary
of
ab
i
actually
enjoy
this
more
than
blue
moon
right
now
the
other
major
foray
into
craft
brew
wannabes
that
i
can
think
of
as
much
as
i
am
loathe
to
give
them
props
over
anything
just
me
being
contrarianmy
hippie
upbringing
i
have
to
give
kudos
to
ab
for
their
entry
into
the
giant
terminator
robot
in
ipods
clothing
aka
the
soundwave
award
market
also
it
makes
me
crave
french
fries
dont
ask
why
but
it
just
hit
me
as
i
was
finishing
the
last
half
and
editing
this
review
time
for
some
five
guys
notes
a
craft
brew
forgery
from
packaging
to
pour
it
looks
and
feels
like
a
craft
brew
but
lacks
complexity
and
is
simply
unbalanced
coors
did
a
much
better
job
with
blue
moon
than
budweiser
did
with
shock
top
when
poured
a
nice
thick
head
forms
eventually
allowing
you
to
smell
the
orange
and
citrus
flavors
the
head
disappears
completely
after
a
few
minutes
it
smells
great
and
tastes
even
better
the
orange
flavors
are
powerful
yet
not
over
the
top
and
the
after
taste
is
pleasant
i
greatly
prefer
this
over
the
similar
tasting
blue
moon
qute
easily
the
least
impressive
white
ale
ive
yet
to
try
anheuserbusch
strikes
again
sheesh
the
crack
and
glug
netted
me
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
fell
to
pieces
like
a
novice
criminal
under
intense
questioning
color
was
a
very
cloudy
orangishyellow
nose
was
certainly
spicy
enough
and
i
have
got
to
learn
to
distinguish
grains
of
paradise
from
coriander
but
i
am
betting
on
the
latter
here
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
not
outright
watery
but
not
much
better
than
that
the
taste
was
kind
of
muted
with
hints
of
orange
peel
coriander
and
even
some
yeasty
mustiness
but
it
seemed
weak
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
even
peppery
but
i
still
felt
like
it
needed
more
ooomph
a
canundrum
do
i
take
up
space
in
the
cooler
knowing
that
i
will
not
be
drinking
it
but
some
honey
honeys
might
ill
err
on
the
side
of
caution
and
throw
some
in
as
bait
once
i
have
them
on
my
blanket
under
my
umbrella
well
break
out
the
ten
fidy
overall
i
cant
say
im
impressed
after
having
a
couple
of
brewes
from
brewery
ommegang
in
the
past
week
this
does
not
come
close
blue
moon
belgian
white
is
a
better
choice
for
this
style
i
tried
shock
top
because
i
heard
it
was
all
the
rave
then
i
found
it
was
made
by
bud
strike
one
i
drank
5
of
them
and
had
to
choke
them
down
it
had
a
very
strong
orange
taste
to
it
which
actually
is
sickening
bud
is
trying
to
get
into
the
micro
brew
market
but
they
cant
because
they
simply
cannot
amke
a
decent
beer
surprisingly
even
though
i
rated
all
of
this
a
3
o
across
the
board
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
again
due
to
how
refreshing
and
smooth
it
was
they
promote
it
to
have
a
spice
infuse
with
it
but
i
could
not
taste
it
at
all
that
is
my
only
true
disappointment
with
this
beer
it
is
infinitely
better
than
a
blue
moon
to
me
although
the
look
is
identical
just
as
is
the
mouth
feel
the
difference
is
that
a
blue
moon
seemed
to
make
me
feel
like
i
was
drinking
beer
and
giving
me
the
feeling
of
a
full
stomach
shock
top
did
not
give
me
that
full
feeling
even
after
a
6
pack
being
a
belgian
white
ale
i
was
impressed
but
i
wish
it
tasted
a
bit
more
like
a
beer
and
not
a
fruity
wine
got
this
witbier
on
draft
in
a
pint
glass
shocktop
poured
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
it
produced
a
night
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
there
was
a
little
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
featured
malted
wheat
and
slight
traces
of
cloves
and
orange
peels
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
mostly
comprised
of
a
soft
wheat
sweet
malt
clove
and
orange
there
is
only
a
faint
trace
of
hops
at
the
finish
shock
top
is
light
in
body
its
drinkability
is
high
but
its
not
much
more
then
a
lawn
mower
beer
it
might
be
a
good
starter
beer
to
introduce
to
a
bud
light
drinker
but
even
at
that
i
would
suggest
a
blue
moon
or
a
boulevard
wheat
over
shock
top
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
6
2011
after
purchasing
at
the
queens
quaq
lcbo
outlet
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
huge
white
cap
that
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
citrus
and
yeast
the
spice
is
nonexistent
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
the
flavour
is
sour
a
little
wheat
and
a
little
spice
and
sourness
is
not
a
citrus
sour
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
from
ab
its
surprising
mouthfeel
is
something
entirely
unexpected
and
pleasantly
so
i
could
be
happy
drinking
this
it
certainly
rivals
blue
moon
very
nice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
nothing
exceptional
but
not
a
bad
buy
i
bought
it
because
alot
of
my
friends
will
compare
wheat
beers
to
this
one
and
i
had
never
tried
it
im
not
disappointed
pours
a
hazy
very
pale
yelloworange
color
with
a
12
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
fizzy
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
no
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
of
wheat
spices
coriander
and
a
surprisingly
nice
orange
scent
taste
is
of
wheat
up
front
spices
coming
through
in
the
middle
and
the
orangecitrus
flavors
coming
in
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
making
for
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
witbier
but
good
for
coming
from
ab
overall
i
can
see
exactly
why
this
beer
as
such
an
amazing
rating
another
quality
offering
from
ab
here
of
course
if
you
cant
read
the
sarcasm
in
that
one
then
you
have
drank
one
too
many
shock
tops
already
this
beer
is
almost
absolute
drainpour
material
the
only
that
that
was
somewhat
promising
was
the
look
of
it
it
does
look
like
a
wit
beer
and
goes
completely
downhill
from
there
the
smells
and
the
tastes
are
very
muted
and
although
getting
both
a
citrusy
fruit
smell
and
taste
it
never
really
translated
to
anything
orange
to
me
would
not
pick
this
one
up
again
and
the
only
reason
i
did
is
because
i
never
noticed
it
before
at
the
lcbo
and
also
neglected
to
notice
that
this
was
an
ab
beer
until
i
got
home
layover
at
dulles
in
the
lufthansa
senator
lounge
and
they
have
becks
and
shock
top
on
tap
started
with
the
shock
top
never
had
it
before
the
color
is
an
unfiltered
yellow
with
thin
creamy
head
the
aroma
is
powered
by
citrus
and
subtle
grain
the
initial
taste
is
an
orange
peel
then
turn
a
little
tart
certainly
would
compare
this
to
blue
moon
it
is
easy
on
the
mouth
and
would
be
great
on
a
warm
day
the
beer
is
light
tan
and
hazy
with
virtually
no
head
from
my
pour
the
smell
is
faint
yeasty
slightly
earthy
maybe
a
bit
off
the
taste
is
rather
weaklightmoderately
sweet
slight
citrus
light
grain
wheatoat
its
not
terrible
and
for
a
macro
beer
actually
passable
maybe
a
good
beer
to
use
to
help
friends
transition
to
craft
beer
i
have
a
few
bottles
in
my
fridge
that
a
friend
left
behindmaybe
ill
eventually
drink
them
all
so
this
witbier
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
orange
color
the
head
is
deceit
and
leaves
a
surprisingly
nice
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
some
wheat
aromas
and
lots
of
citrus
the
taste
is
citrusy
also
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
on
the
light
side
overall
id
never
buy
this
beer
for
myself
i
will
drink
it
if
its
free
overall
not
a
bad
brew
i
know
many
in
the
beeradvocate
world
would
love
to
bash
me
for
that
last
statement
truth
is
its
time
to
put
the
hatred
for
ab
products
behind
this
beer
is
enjoyable
especially
on
these
hot
days
of
summer
and
priced
recession
friendly
also
it
is
easily
attainable
dont
hate
give
it
a
shot
i
respect
busch
for
trying
to
fit
in
with
the
craft
beer
scene
but
i
also
disrespect
them
for
trying
to
fool
innocent
beerlovers
with
a
neat
little
can
with
cool
artwork
that
this
could
possibly
be
a
decent
witbier
cloudy
pale
golden
colour
2
fingers
of
fluffy
white
head
some
lace
left
behind
smell
is
of
orange
spice
yeast
though
most
of
the
orange
scent
is
quite
artificial
tasting
taste
is
of
artificial
orange
spice
and
yeast
come
through
but
very
fake
tasting
thin
mouthfeel
big
carbonation
light
to
med
weight
body
pass
on
this
not
very
good
bad
example
of
the
style
half
got
drank
the
other
half
saw
the
sink
jh
o
not
impressed
overall
this
is
a
great
inexpensive
summer
time
brew
im
glad
i
tried
the
stuff
m
it
is
easy
to
drink
not
to
bitter
not
to
sweet
the
ending
is
not
very
lasting
and
between
dry
and
chewy
obviously
another
weak
bmc
attempt
at
brewing
craft
standard
witbier
flavors
but
its
as
if
they
mixed
full
strength
beer
with
a
portion
of
sparkling
water
o
not
very
enjoyable
at
all
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
this
again
on
tap
at
a
small
wv
brewpub
served
in
a
20
short
mug
with
an
orange
wedge
color
is
a
hazy
strawgold
light
with
a
few
white
bubbles
head
is
quick
aromas
are
simple
lemon
wheat
and
straw
flavor
is
delightfully
tangy
and
fresh
nice
light
malt
and
tart
fruit
slight
sweet
wheatiness
on
the
finish
very
refreshing
and
chuggable
not
my
beer
of
choice
but
given
the
choice
of
this
or
landshark
i
was
very
pleased
with
my
beverage
much
to
my
enjoyment
it
doesnt
give
you
that
overwhelming
fake
fruit
taste
like
budlight
lime
or
miller
chill
does
i
would
much
rather
enjoy
the
calmer
and
more
natural
notes
of
orange
in
this
beer
than
other
anheuserbusch
citrus
infused
beers
the
beer
is
cloudy
wheat
with
a
funky
off
taste
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
is
about
the
most
prominent
flavor
it
seems
like
just
barely
enough
barley
to
take
it
a
notch
above
bud
wheat
would
have
been
a
great
beer
for
1
75
in
a
plastic
cup
at
a
blackhawks
game
but
give
me
my
money
back
for
a
7
00
beer
when
i
thought
i
was
buying
something
decent
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
orangeyellow
body
with
a
two
finger
head
which
dwindles
to
minimal
foam
on
the
body
smells
of
slightly
metallic
orange
peel
and
a
bit
of
white
bread
tastes
of
orangey
white
bread
with
a
slightly
dry
bready
finish
overall
not
a
spectacular
beer
but
ill
take
one
for
free
o
i
had
this
particular
bottle
at
outback
steakhouse
in
avon
indiana
i
had
about
half
of
it
before
my
steak
came
out
im
sorry
to
say
that
i
got
my
first
taste
of
real
flavor
that
night
when
i
ate
not
when
i
drank
even
though
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
shock
top
i
cant
shake
the
feeling
thats
it
not
true
craft
beer
not
enough
flavor
not
enough
drinkability
not
enough
reasons
to
get
it
again
poured
a
pale
orange
a
few
shades
lighter
than
the
colour
of
the
can
itself
fluffy
head
of
a
couple
fingers
forms
and
settles
to
a
foamy
cap
retains
moderately
without
any
lace
nose
is
mild
some
wheat
light
orange
and
faint
zestiness
taste
struggles
to
represent
the
witbier
stlye
yet
still
remain
under
the
constraints
of
feeling
like
a
macro
beer
containing
a
weak
bmc
lager
feel
throughout
some
wheat
mild
citrus
grain
notes
and
mild
hint
of
alcohol
is
present
in
the
finish
some
spice
coriander
as
per
the
can
makes
its
way
through
in
the
finish
as
the
glass
warms
high
carbonation
and
yet
a
surprisingly
decent
body
with
a
bit
of
weight
to
it
at
times
definitely
not
hard
to
put
down
and
ideal
for
a
warm
day
yet
nothing
special
as
a
wit
there
are
few
things
better
in
the
beer
world
than
witbiers
and
few
things
worse
than
anheuserbusch
products
a
combination
of
the
two
results
in
something
predictably
average
while
it
is
pleasant
and
agreeable
and
frankly
quite
appealing
it
is
also
a
shamelessly
kitschy
halfrate
offering
that
compares
poorly
with
honest
integral
examples
of
the
style
overall
im
not
really
sure
why
this
beer
catches
so
much
hate
its
not
mind
blowing
but
it
also
isnt
a
typical
adjunct
beer
it
has
a
fantastic
appearance
the
flavour
is
decent
and
the
price
is
right
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
this
summer
this
just
came
to
ontario
pours
a
faintly
cloudy
pale
orange
colour
with
thin
white
head
smells
of
orange
peel
some
lemon
with
wheat
malt
fairly
clean
flavour
a
little
bit
tart
from
the
lemon
fairly
high
carbonation
level
this
is
an
ok
witbier
and
i
wouldnt
pass
it
up
but
not
going
to
seek
out
again
i
dont
give
a
schlitz
for
shock
top
hey
it
is
what
it
is
a
dumbed
down
version
of
the
style
not
completely
terrible
just
not
particularly
complex
or
engaging
or
worth
ever
drinking
again
not
that
bad
at
all
as
an
inexpensive
summer
patio
beer
and
it
could
catch
on
with
casual
beer
drinkers
but
any
real
wheat
beer
fan
will
just
pine
for
something
with
more
body
and
character
while
drinking
this
i
could
understand
a
noncraft
drinker
going
to
a
bar
and
getting
this
thinking
that
they
were
indulging
in
something
better
than
bmc
but
in
reality
is
a
very
short
step
up
if
available
hoegaarden
is
a
much
better
choice
for
a
witbier
and
is
as
far
as
i
know
almost
as
available
as
shock
top
but
i
cant
say
that
i
was
too
surprised
with
this
one
t
again
a
lot
of
wheat
flavor
but
it
seems
to
be
sweetened
and
the
result
isnt
great
as
it
warms
its
straight
bad
news
mouthfeel
is
slightly
creamy
and
not
bad
ill
give
ab
a
thumbs
up
for
effort
on
this
it
does
have
some
pretty
good
citrus
bite
to
it
and
it
is
very
drinkable
light
mouthfeel
but
easy
to
drink
of
course
it
pales
in
comparison
to
a
good
belgian
witbier
and
is
not
as
good
as
the
beer
it
was
obviously
created
to
counter
blue
moon
but
better
than
your
average
macro
offering
although
i
did
not
taste
the
spice
in
this
wheat
i
did
however
like
the
light
refreshing
taste
of
citrus
the
drink
stayed
cold
and
was
enjoyed
with
a
crab
cake
i
stumbled
onto
this
brew
at
outback
steakhouse
when
poured
into
a
glass
there
was
little
to
no
head
and
was
a
golden
cloudy
color
which
may
turn
some
beer
buffs
off
overall
this
is
a
basic
beer
i
wonder
if
the
brew
was
any
different
before
a
b
mass
produced
o
not
a
bad
wit
especially
given
the
brewer
but
it
was
by
no
means
a
favourite
of
mine
could
use
a
bit
more
up
front
on
the
flavours
and
the
lack
of
carbonation
made
it
a
bit
subpar
overall
a
good
beer
for
a
reasonable
price
great
for
drinking
on
a
hot
day
would
recommend
this
beer
especially
to
someone
just
starting
to
drink
alternative
beers
there
is
nothing
special
or
unique
about
this
beer
i
really
dont
have
much
more
to
say
except
i
would
probably
prefer
something
differant
for
instance
a
samuel
adams
cherry
wheat
edit
4611
im
also
picking
up
some
apple
flavors
in
there
this
time
but
it
doesnt
add
enough
to
merit
it
additional
pointage
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
march
26
2011
it
pours
a
cloudy
oliveyellow
with
a
thin
head
and
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
typical
for
a
witbier
but
less
pronounced
with
its
subtle
malts
wheat
notes
and
lemon
zest
the
body
is
slick
and
creamy
limited
to
no
spices
in
the
taste
but
a
bit
better
in
the
wheat
department
d
very
drinkable
good
for
a
summer
day
but
tastewise
there
is
much
better
out
d
its
not
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
one
either
better
beers
for
the
price
d
it
took
all
of
me
to
finish
this
the
beer
was
a
murky
dark
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
there
was
some
sediment
in
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
faint
i
only
noticed
small
traces
of
orange
and
wheat
taste
is
similar
orange
wheat
lemon
and
a
bready
citrusy
aftertaste
the
beer
is
very
light
and
the
carbonation
is
low
this
was
a
pretty
forgetable
beer
d
this
beer
is
ok
it
has
many
characteristics
that
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
grass
however
the
beer
could
be
much
more
flavorful
memorable
and
refreshing
if
it
had
more
of
the
traditional
citrusy
and
spicy
witbier
characteristics
d
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
summer
day
i
could
easily
kick
back
a
few
of
these
and
be
off
to
a
nice
evening
truth
be
told
not
bad
just
not
very
complex
i
could
drink
4
of
these
like
water
drinkable
yes
exciting
no
dr
id
have
it
again
at
this
price
especially
if
i
was
just
drinking
casually
dont
serve
it
with
an
orange
in
it
lads
a
beer
is
meant
to
be
experienced
as
it
is
created
i
have
to
admit
my
expectations
were
low
but
this
may
be
the
best
ab
brewed
beer
ive
had
because
that
statement
is
saying
a
lot
psh
drinkability
it
is
an
average
beer
to
drink
but
only
enjoyed
one
today
some
days
are
better
than
others
as
far
as
freshness
with
this
beer
always
ask
for
an
orange
with
it
to
finish
the
last
68
ounces
after
reviewing
pours
to
a
frothy
white
head
with
fine
bubbles
and
a
cloudy
gold
color
aroma
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
orange
spice
peppery
lemony
coriander
no
doubt
and
wheat
flavor
is
on
the
weak
side
but
acceptable
for
style
orange
notes
with
coriander
finish
nice
creamy
wheat
flavor
and
residual
sweetness
to
offset
the
spice
and
citrus
good
mouthfeel
and
an
overall
decent
offering
from
ab
overall
like
some
others
have
said
if
i
had
the
choice
between
the
usual
american
brews
at
a
barrestaurant
and
this
one
and
no
other
microbrews
were
available
this
would
be
my
choice
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
though
not
a
great
example
of
a
witbier
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
style
personally
id
like
a
little
more
tartness
and
a
lot
more
hops
i
will
buy
it
again
because
the
flavorprice
ratio
is
very
good
and
if
i
want
to
put
some
beers
out
for
friends
this
is
a
good
one
to
have
in
the
cooler
d
drain
beer
not
impressed
not
as
awful
as
i
thought
but
it
still
sucks
ill
take
a
hoegaarden
harpoon
ufo
white
or
even
a
blue
moon
before
this
thank
god
it
was
a
gift
the
world
is
changing
d
this
is
a
witbier
that
i
will
drink
again
fits
the
style
well
not
much
else
to
say
ive
had
it
on
tap
too
and
i
think
it
was
better
on
tap
quite
surprising
for
an
ab
beer
considering
its
actually
good
give
it
a
try
not
again
i
will
not
do
this
to
myself
again
head
started
off
good
at
two
fingers
but
didnt
last
long
no
lace
color
is
a
6
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
and
the
beer
is
quite
hazy
smell
of
honey
malt
and
citrus
taste
is
sort
of
bland
some
wheat
and
malt
taste
a
little
bit
of
spice
come
in
after
the
initial
flavor
is
gone
has
a
mellow
mouthfeel
not
enough
to
call
creamy
but
better
than
water
i
would
not
go
out
and
buy
this
to
drink
but
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
it
was
in
a
selection
to
drink
at
a
party
overall
its
a
beer
targeted
to
the
masses
and
for
what
i
think
michelob
is
trying
to
accomplish
they
did
a
good
job
shock
top
is
another
deceivingly
american
beer
seems
foreign
but
its
nothing
special
just
another
bud
product
its
really
good
for
a
cheaper
beer
and
it
has
a
crisp
wheat
taste
worth
a
try
but
it
gets
a
little
boring
and
its
not
a
beer
you
can
have
a
full
six
pack
of
in
one
sitting
i
had
seen
this
beer
a
few
times
before
but
tried
it
for
the
first
time
yesterday
i
really
enjoyed
it
very
crisp
refreshing
taste
with
little
to
no
aftertaste
seems
like
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
beer
ill
definitely
be
looking
for
it
in
a
few
months
feel
this
would
be
adequate
for
summertime
consumption
not
my
fave
but
would
definately
have
more
if
given
a
choice
of
any
other
ab
products
i
favor
it
over
blue
moon
because
it
costs
a
good
deal
less
verdict
this
beer
is
a
fair
buy
for
some
but
ive
had
better
weissbier
and
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
severely
lacking
which
amongst
other
minor
issues
taste
and
flavor
based
mainly
does
not
draw
me
back
to
invest
in
any
more
of
this
brand
at
least
on
my
dime
however
for
those
who
like
weissbiers
or
anything
wheatheavy
you
might
get
some
cheap
thrills
from
this
one
c
2
7
mouthfeel
is
where
it
takes
a
dive
here
it
feels
really
watery
and
doesnt
hold
much
substance
however
drinkability
is
still
good
fairly
light
for
a
beer
of
this
type
more
transparent
than
expected
golden
hue
thin
white
head
thin
retention
spotty
lacing
very
slight
lemon
in
the
nose
but
underwhelming
overall
ditto
the
flavor
thin
lemonish
taste
allaround
very
thin
feel
and
overlycarbonated
if
you
dont
put
a
slice
of
orange
in
this
its
a
modest
step
up
from
a
water
with
lemon
d
to
be
honest
you
can
and
i
did
drink
a
lot
of
this
the
abv
is
low
enough
and
the
flavor
is
light
that
makes
this
a
easy
drinker
i
praise
ab
for
trying
to
break
into
the
belgian
white
profile
but
lets
bump
up
the
flavor
guys
something
about
this
beer
just
didnt
seem
quite
right
when
i
had
this
at
the
pub
the
other
night
all
aspects
of
this
beer
seemed
off
the
murkymuddy
look
of
it
through
the
glass
was
a
turnoff
the
taste
was
odd
and
despite
not
being
very
flavorful
it
was
a
hard
drinker
im
guess
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
whites
shock
top
and
blue
moon
as
my
only
2
reference
points
overall
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
drinkability
brewed
by
michelobab
as
a
massmarket
adjuct
beer
i
found
this
to
be
nonoffensive
yet
unimpressive
finally
the
beer
does
the
same
thing
to
your
stomach
as
budweiser
basically
a
rolling
squeaky
loud
digestion
process
for
a
whole
day
i
only
had
5
its
hard
to
balance
the
score
for
this
review
since
i
like
a
number
of
witbiers
more
that
this
one
im
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
beer
is
just
a
slightly
above
average
example
of
it
this
beer
is
what
originally
got
me
into
to
craft
beers
and
the
belgian
white
style
unfortunately
there
is
nothing
else
truly
spectacular
about
it
for
a
coors
product
though
id
say
this
is
a
step
above
the
rest
when
pouring
this
beer
it
is
an
orangish
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
with
very
little
retention
and
not
much
lacing
it
has
little
carbonation
in
it
and
the
smell
is
of
a
citrus
and
wheat
aroma
while
the
taste
has
some
wheat
with
a
strong
citrus
taste
that
blends
pretty
well
with
the
wheat
and
hops
in
it
the
body
is
a
medium
feel
that
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
i
will
admit
that
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
belgian
white
wheat
beers
the
body
was
nicely
smooth
and
pretty
typical
for
the
style
drinkability
was
good
but
lost
some
points
because
the
was
so
bland
why
would
you
drink
more
than
one
overall
this
may
make
a
good
training
wheel
beer
for
the
noncraft
drinker
get
em
started
with
this
and
then
they
can
expand
their
horizons
not
much
a
feel
in
the
mouth
but
tastes
ok
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
wheat
beer
and
its
available
ill
have
it
but
there
arent
many
wheat
beers
that
i
would
reach
past
to
grab
one
drinkability
not
something
id
look
forward
to
drinking
on
a
regular
basis
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
light
since
i
got
that
solvent
taste
in
the
beer
it
was
off
putting
and
i
really
did
not
want
to
finish
it
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
but
it
is
what
it
is
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
decent
head
relatively
unimpressive
smells
has
a
good
crisp
taste
with
a
lot
of
citrus
and
very
sweet
flavors
decent
mouth
feel
and
pretty
good
drinkability
as
one
would
expect
from
a
anheuserbush
product
this
beer
overall
is
just
quite
mediocre
and
i
highly
doubt
i
would
buy
it
again
i
think
i
would
only
find
my
self
having
this
one
again
if
it
is
offered
at
a
friends
house
the
taste
is
a
refreshing
fruity
thirst
quenching
a
little
bit
watery
for
my
taste
but
very
drinkable
because
it
feels
very
lite
great
summer
beer
but
needs
to
be
served
cold
d
easy
enough
to
drink
just
boring
fruity
weak
might
enjoy
it
after
working
up
a
sweat
mowing
the
grass
and
you
want
something
light
d
high
if
it
were
hot
out
this
icecold
would
hit
the
spot
but
then
again
with
stuff
like
harpoon
ufo
available
for
the
same
price
why
would
i
reach
for
this
one
drinkable
refreshing
and
mildly
tasty
but
i
dont
think
ill
ever
buy
it
this
beer
is
what
it
is
a
slightly
above
average
immitation
wheat
belgian
not
really
worth
another
look
considering
the
microbrew
wheats
now
available
this
is
michelobs
best
and
yet
im
not
a
fan
of
michelob
but
they
get
my
vote
on
this
one
i
could
have
a
session
with
this
a
in
my
book
d
very
drinkable
a
little
light
and
bland
overall
but
also
very
smooth
and
east
to
drink
id
rather
have
this
one
than
blue
moon
most
of
the
time
and
if
all
they
have
is
bmc
then
shock
top
is
an
easy
choice
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
good
lacing
smells
of
wheat
and
orange
peel
tastes
of
orange
peel
and
other
citrus
and
wheat
goodness
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
drinkability
is
too
drinkability
is
again
fine
word
of
the
day
is
fine
i
wont
be
buying
this
beer
again
but
if
its
around
and
theres
only
bullshit
to
be
had
ill
be
saying
hi
to
the
mohawk
orange
again
not
that
great
of
a
brew
drinkable
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
because
there
isnt
a
killer
beer
around
meh
pretty
good
pour
ive
had
it
a
few
times
from
draft
and
recently
bought
it
on
sale
at
my
local
store
pour
wasnt
bad
nice
light
yellow
color
head
was
good
nice
citrus
smell
has
a
bit
of
hop
and
perfume
taste
i
didnt
add
and
fruit
in
the
end
i
think
i
would
of
bought
a
6
pack
instead
of
a
12
pack
the
flavor
is
mildly
yeasty
w
subtle
citrus
peel
and
light
wheat
flavor
more
or
less
flat
in
the
flavor
dept
with
gentle
spice
in
the
finish
i
do
not
generally
support
ab
but
tried
to
give
it
an
unbiased
review
like
a
pale
wheat
with
light
banana
and
orange
just
ok
imo
pour
is
not
too
bad
slightly
hazed
apricot
color
with
a
white
head
smell
goes
down
hill
with
some
fake
orange
and
citrus
notes
coming
through
atop
generic
sweetness
taste
just
brings
fake
fruit
galore
not
sure
why
anyone
would
need
to
put
a
citrus
slice
in
this
mouthfeel
is
overly
thick
and
cloying
i
think
i
might
actually
prefer
bud
light
overall
might
be
a
tad
bit
better
than
blue
moon
try
it
finished
of
my
glass
with
some
barbecued
tilapia
good
value
way
overpriced
at
around
7
79
per
sixer
poured
from
bottle
into
ikea
beer
mug
light
amber
color
with
a
nice
white
head
i
actually
couldnt
smell
much
of
anything
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
but
that
mightve
been
my
brain
imagining
it
since
thats
what
i
would
expect
starts
slightly
sweet
which
is
then
quickly
overwhelmed
by
a
relatively
bitter
taste
followed
by
a
very
light
citrus
finish
that
doesnt
quite
manage
to
overpower
the
bitterness
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
other
macrobrews
out
there
i
guess
drinkability
let
me
say
even
with
the
beer
being
made
by
anheuserbusch
i
was
completely
open
to
giving
this
beer
all
fives
unfortunately
it
is
far
too
watered
down
for
any
flavors
to
come
out
d
tolerably
boring
thats
about
all
i
can
say
pours
an
attractive
hazy
orange
with
a
frumpy
white
head
aromas
are
yeasty
with
hints
of
orange
pulpiness
none
of
the
spicier
notes
or
more
openly
citrusy
elements
that
make
other
witbiers
interesting
the
first
thing
i
notice
upon
sipping
it
is
the
texture
which
is
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
but
lacking
the
same
level
of
effervescence
of
most
other
witbiers
flavorwise
theres
not
much
going
on
besides
a
lightly
sweet
wheatiness
and
a
touch
of
orange
juice
doesnt
taste
bad
but
neither
is
it
very
interesting
tastes
kind
of
like
an
orange
which
is
kind
of
neat
but
only
in
moderation
its
ok
to
have
just
one
but
the
second
does
not
go
down
as
well
but
it
doesnt
have
an
offensive
smell
look
or
taste
its
just
a
decent
beverage
but
not
much
of
a
beer
it
may
not
be
the
beer
of
the
month
anymore
at
finns
but
i
wanted
one
anyway
i
dont
know
why
either
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
light
orange
zest
light
lemon
peel
and
what
seems
to
be
coriander
ill
be
honest
though
im
not
sure
how
much
of
this
smell
is
from
the
orange
slice
i
didnt
ask
for
it
by
the
way
and
how
much
is
from
the
beer
the
taste
holds
very
light
orange
zest
cardamom
orange
peel
and
some
light
flowers
the
body
is
quite
light
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
weak
wit
not
entirely
bad
but
not
something
id
necessarily
smile
for
while
ordering
nope
this
is
a
nothing
beer
its
not
anything
special
no
special
flavors
or
strong
hints
that
makes
this
beer
standout
to
me
i
bought
a
six
pack
just
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
it
was
good
for
that
it
was
a
cloudy
beer
and
although
some
people
say
a
hint
of
orange
i
added
a
extra
slice
of
orange
as
the
bottle
shows
this
is
a
summer
beer
taste
good
on
a
hot
day
or
a
warm
summer
night
while
its
got
a
good
drinkability
it
does
fill
you
up
eventually
not
like
other
beers
than
make
you
have
the
munchies
this
is
a
good
relaxing
beer
not
really
a
party
beer
in
my
opinon
has
the
great
wheat
taste
with
hints
of
orange
beer
is
cloudy
tho
which
is
normal
of
most
wheat
beers
ive
had
it
is
available
just
about
anywhere
so
if
you
cant
find
your
favorite
grab
one
of
these
cheers
not
a
bad
beer
was
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
made
by
ab
its
better
than
their
other
beers
ive
had
i
could
not
really
taste
the
citrus
or
other
spices
in
it
its
taste
reminded
me
of
a
light
beer
while
its
not
a
memorable
beer
and
i
wont
buy
it
again
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
it
looked
like
beer
it
had
some
words
on
the
label
that
implied
that
it
was
of
a
variety
that
i
might
like
alas
the
flavor
was
dilute
it
had
a
a
hint
of
artificial
citrus
flavor
and
weak
malt
extract
flavor
the
composite
flavors
held
together
but
they
didnt
amount
to
much
had
a
couple
of
these
at
a
friends
house
which
were
leftovers
from
a
party
overall
i
was
put
off
by
the
very
artifical
aroma
and
taste
of
the
oranges
and
spices
i
dont
want
to
think
about
what
chemicals
are
in
here
but
when
i
drink
it
it
goes
down
very
smooth
and
refreshing
in
fact
after
a
night
of
sessioning
some
higher
abv
brews
this
was
a
welcome
drink
at
the
very
end
basically
this
is
abs
response
to
blue
moon
i
can
see
this
going
over
well
with
the
noncraft
crowd
who
think
theyre
trying
a
craft
beer
i
cant
really
say
anything
else
bad
about
this
because
i
did
enjoy
it
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
buy
this
personally
id
rather
just
have
a
regular
budweiser
or
something
that
i
feel
isnt
as
artifically
made
at
least
i
got
a
couple
of
pryoff
bottles
for
my
homebrew
out
of
the
deal
the
beer
is
a
hazy
bright
almost
artificial
yelloworange
the
witbier
smells
mostly
of
orange
cinnamon
and
clove
the
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
citrus
and
yeast
spice
with
a
bit
of
wheat
present
the
carbonation
is
rough
a
bit
on
the
low
side
and
prickly
on
the
tongue
the
beer
is
thin
and
the
finish
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
not
a
terribly
interesting
or
complex
beer
i
e
not
really
belgian
but
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
the
beach
note
on
my
second
pint
i
asked
for
an
orange
slice
i
say
if
you
want
to
throw
an
entire
orange
in
it
then
do
it
normally
i
dont
like
fruit
in
my
beer
but
there
was
nothing
sacred
about
this
one
so
what
the
hell
orange
slice
it
is
d
pretty
decent
take
on
the
style
a
bit
mild
and
thinly
stereotyped
but
refreshing
nonetheless
better
than
than
bud
light
much
better
ddrinkability
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
one
ill
search
out
again
but
ill
never
turn
it
down
theres
something
about
these
macro
orange
witbiers
that
just
tastes
like
summer
to
me
d
decent
beer
much
better
than
i
expected
from
ab
seems
to
go
best
with
food
d
not
the
best
beer
by
any
means
normally
not
a
fruit
in
beer
person
but
i
think
id
take
the
orange
in
this
case
as
it
makes
up
for
a
lack
of
flavor
d
ok
its
drinkable
just
not
much
flavor
here
and
i
would
rather
drink
many
other
different
beers
before
i
would
drink
this
again
pours
a
cloudy
pale
goldenorangey
color
head
slowly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
film
on
top
has
the
traditional
clove
and
banana
smells
of
a
wheat
beer
tastes
wheatey
with
a
little
bit
of
citrusey
orange
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
it
surely
isnt
perfect
but
its
refreshing
even
though
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
ab
i
think
this
is
a
reasonable
beer
d
unimpressive
reminds
me
of
a
slightly
improved
version
of
bud
or
miller
gd
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
great
brew
for
hot
summer
days
and
cookouts
a
decent
beer
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
cheaper
than
blue
moon
and
almost
as
good
great
summer
brew
not
sure
id
go
for
it
in
the
winter
as
i
like
darker
beers
in
the
winter
months
here
in
connecticut
i
get
a
sixer
of
this
at
least
once
a
month
during
the
summer
and
fall
nice
citrusy
taste
michelob
did
a
good
job
here
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
the
inviting
aroma
this
beer
had
good
balance
of
spices
and
citrus
though
i
wasnt
blown
away
with
its
taste
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
good
buy
for
a
chain
restaurant
option
d
its
very
decent
if
you
cant
find
blue
moon
or
are
just
a
cheap
ass
and
dont
wanna
pay
the
extra
dough
for
blue
moon
then
this
is
good
nice
dinner
beer
if
i
may
say
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
film
of
head
and
alot
of
bubbles
smells
of
clove
and
a
little
banana
tastes
ok
at
first
with
alot
of
spice
and
banana
flavor
up
front
but
falls
flat
quickly
leaving
the
mouth
with
an
empty
feeling
also
i
noticed
the
flavors
get
less
and
less
noticeable
as
you
approach
the
bottom
of
the
glass
very
fluid
mouthfeel
with
very
little
body
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
refreshing
brew
that
achieves
its
goal
of
appealing
to
the
masses
but
thats
about
it
pours
a
murky
off
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
and
some
ok
retention
with
a
smallish
ring
smell
is
of
clove
and
fruit
some
spice
but
its
faint
tatse
is
the
same
it
has
a
belgian
look
to
it
but
the
flavors
are
so
thin
and
faint
its
like
they
tried
to
make
a
great
brew
but
just
did
not
put
enough
ingredients
into
it
thin
mouth
feel
as
well
not
a
solid
attempt
of
the
style
and
unflavorful
while
surely
not
special
this
beer
offers
much
more
character
from
the
bottle
when
compared
to
the
draft
version
md
bubbly
at
first
then
smooth
high
drinkability
its
lite
so
this
was
one
of
the
few
options
on
tap
at
a
weekly
outdoor
music
series
here
in
boulder
appearance
is
a
hazy
straw
color
about
a
fingers
worth
of
head
that
leaves
an
average
amount
of
lacing
when
gone
smell
is
a
little
lacking
nothing
special
taste
starts
off
ok
however
about
halfway
through
things
go
horribly
wrong
kinda
tastes
like
someone
went
on
a
rampage
in
my
spice
rack
and
dumped
a
bunch
of
crap
in
my
beer
way
too
overpowering
the
spiciness
is
way
out
of
balance
in
my
opinion
but
if
thats
more
your
style
i
could
see
this
being
a
very
sessionable
summer
beer
however
overall
a
swing
and
a
miss
in
my
opinion
dits
ok
i
guess
id
choose
it
over
blue
moon
most
of
the
time
so
i
guess
the
brewer
accomplished
what
he
set
out
to
do
i
bought
a
six
pack
trying
to
decide
if
i
want
to
get
a
keg
of
it
im
still
undecided
it
seems
like
a
nice
summer
beer
so
maybe
ill
get
it
since
its
summertime
this
was
an
interesting
beer
the
taste
was
very
much
like
that
of
a
blue
moon
but
slightly
less
sweet
i
had
this
one
out
of
the
bottle
unfortunately
yet
it
was
still
a
very
refreshing
beer
something
that
would
go
great
with
a
summer
bbq
taste
was
citrusy
slightly
sweet
not
much
in
the
area
of
hops
and
yeasty
good
summer
beer
d
good
i
actually
liked
this
more
than
my
current
macro
favorite
blue
moon
a
damn
decent
attempt
at
a
classic
belgian
style
great
for
summer
drinking
pouring
a
hazy
light
orange
this
beer
has
no
head
and
no
lace
it
looks
rather
turbid
not
really
how
i
expect
my
witbiers
to
look
the
nose
is
rather
poor
with
a
lot
of
fruit
character
quite
dominated
by
an
orange
juice
like
sweetness
that
does
not
work
when
coupled
with
the
coriander
thats
also
quite
prominent
wheat
character
is
dominated
by
these
characteristics
the
palate
while
similar
is
a
little
more
palatable
opening
with
a
blend
of
orange
juice
and
coriander
spiciness
this
is
rather
overwhelming
on
the
palate
quite
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
care
for
this
beer
has
some
wheat
flavor
before
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
lingering
orange
and
coriander
character
it
feels
rather
overcarbonated
and
isnt
particularly
pleasant
i
couldnt
care
enough
to
actually
consume
the
entire
glass
not
recommended
im
usually
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
white
but
this
was
tasty
i
dont
like
blue
moon
very
much
because
the
added
flavors
are
too
strong
i
was
surprised
blue
moon
has
an
a
rating
this
was
much
more
my
style
i
got
this
in
the
michelob
sampler
dont
know
if
id
buy
shock
top
alone
but
im
happy
to
add
it
to
my
menu
for
a
little
variety

drinkability
a
cold
one
on
a
hot
day
might
be
more
drinkable
but
probably
not
i
didnt
really
like
it
i
wouldnt
drink
it
again
the
fact
that
they
even
mention
this
as
being
a
belgian
style
is
a
slap
in
the
face
to
every
decent
belgian
beer
out
there
without
a
doubt
the
bottom
of
the
line
in
any
witbier
i
have
ever
had
drinkability
actually
a
beer
you
might
see
a
person
who
wants
to
appear
to
be
drinking
smart
but
really
is
just
a
throw
blanket
on
another
failed
attempt
to
persuade
real
beer
aficionado
that
they
might
be
drinking
smart
went
down
very
clean
and
crisp
though
i
would
recommand
to
my
friend
whos
recently
trying
to
spread
his
good
beer
drinking
wings
cheers
d
i
was
unaware
ab
brewed
this
when
i
ordered
it
i
guess
that
explains
why
its
just
not
that
great
of
a
beer
its
a
session
beer
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
though
i
personally
wouldnt
want
to
drink
another
as
there
are
far
many
better
beers
out
there
mine
was
served
with
an
orange
slice
which
greatly
improved
the
flavor
of
this
beer
when
it
was
finally
added
to
it
its
definitely
abs
answer
to
coors
blue
moon
but
i
actually
think
its
better
its
not
a
bad
brew
but
nothing
compared
to
a
really
good
craft
beer
or
german
pour
at
oktoberfest
its
better
without
the
stinking
orange
chunk
that
they
seem
compelled
to
add
but
im
not
an
orange
fan
i
would
rather
drink
this
than
a
budweiser
but
its
still
only
just
ok
this
was
no
doubt
a
beer
created
in
response
to
coors
success
with
blue
moon
the
look
of
the
beer
is
light
straw
the
smell
is
not
very
impressive
but
might
smell
like
clove
if
you
were
to
try
very
hard
the
taste
is
not
bad
for
a
bmc
product
but
if
i
am
going
to
buy
gas
station
beer
i
will
go
for
a
blue
moon
before
i
buy
this
again
the
carb
was
fine
and
this
was
a
drinkable
beer
just
as
i
am
sure
it
was
designed
to
be
like
the
nose
the
orange
and
lemon
are
the
dominant
flavors
some
spices
are
vaguely
noticeable
the
wheat
character
seems
to
be
nowhere
to
be
found
body
is
thin
and
moderately
carbinated
easy
enough
to
drink
but
disappointing
in
the
end
i
kinda
figured
that
this
would
be
similar
to
blue
moon
but
it
seems
to
pale
in
comparison
and
i
am
not
really
a
fan
of
blue
moon
very
drinkable
i
must
admit
im
a
bit
surprised
that
michelob
put
something
out
like
this
its
not
good
enough
to
make
it
on
my
regular
drinker
list
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
it
was
offered
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
large
head
that
disappears
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
watered
down
citrus
which
is
barely
noticeable
the
taste
is
also
barely
noticeable
some
citrus
flavor
but
nothing
special
light
bodied
over
carbonated
nothing
to
get
excited
about
taste
is
very
dry
and
yeasty
its
got
a
light
orange
finish
its
really
fresh
and
dry
its
not
bad
but
not
very
complex
or
flavrful
pours
out
to
a
slighty
hazy
golden
color
in
the
glass
faint
yeast
and
citrus
are
present
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
mild
yet
flavorful
contradictory
but
true
there
is
pronounced
but
subdued
citrus
flavor
that
leads
to
a
easy
to
drink
beer
a
good
warm
weather
offering
i
bought
a
12er
of
the
shock
top
because
my
wife
likes
blue
moon
and
i
wanted
something
different
but
still
something
along
the
line
of
a
belgian
white
beer
initially
i
was
impressed
with
the
color
and
aroma
very
citrusy
and
the
color
looks
delicious
quite
a
nice
shock
on
my
first
taste
a
decent
amount
of
citrus
and
great
flavors
even
though
this
is
an
ab
product
ill
be
buying
it
again
should
be
a
great
beer
for
after
mowing
the
grass
and
doing
outside
work
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
shock
top
is
a
hazy
goldenwhite
color
with
a
nice
foamy
cap
the
nose
is
sweet
and
citrusy
with
a
touch
of
wheat
earthiness
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
slight
spiciness
that
was
not
apparent
in
the
nose
and
the
citrusy
character
takes
on
a
more
tart
lemony
note
the
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
body
with
a
soapy
carbonation
and
slightly
drying
due
to
the
tart
finish
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
a
decent
try
at
a
witbier
for
ab
this
is
definitely
a
warm
weather
beer
good
for
sipping
on
the
lawn
mower
hey
at
least
anheuserbusch
inc
is
trying
something
a
little
different
d
goes
down
ok
not
very
tasty
the
artificial
flavoring
is
a
tad
much
ive
had
better
of
the
style
and
would
opt
for
something
else
overall
not
a
great
brew
but
a
great
party
drink
and
something
that
would
go
well
in
the
summer
you
have
to
know
what
youre
getting
into
when
you
buy
this
beer
shock
top
purs
a
bit
fizzy
with
a
cloudy
yellowish
amber
the
beer
smells
of
citrus
not
much
else
taste
is
the
same
a
bit
of
lemony
citrus
no
grapefruit
from
hops
or
anything
finish
is
dry
and
clean
beer
gets
a
bit
to
sweet
as
it
warms
and
way
too
soda
like
nothing
offensive
here
but
not
worth
buying
again
the
look
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
tends
to
just
average
its
not
a
beer
you
would
sit
back
and
go
wow
this
is
awesome
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
the
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
definetly
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
day
when
you
want
something
refreshing
i
suggest
you
drink
it
with
out
an
orange
cause
it
already
has
a
citrus
taste
to
it
and
if
u
add
the
orange
it
will
be
overwhelming
but
on
the
other
hand
it
tastes
good
and
goes
down
real
easy
it
is
citrusy
making
it
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
nothing
special
but
still
better
than
typical
sporting
venue
beer
and
is
a
nice
selection
for
sporting
events
my
favorite
at
sporting
venues
in
the
michigan
area
somewhere
in
the
void
between
good
and
bad
this
beer
will
undoubtedly
continue
to
do
well
in
the
marketplace
but
for
my
dollar
id
choose
many
beers
over
it
any
day
of
the
week
or
time
of
year
for
style
its
too
refined
in
the
spice
department
to
really
pique
my
fancy
and
the
brash
tangy
malt
character
means
nothing
without
the
sweetish
rich
pils
back
that
i
crave
for
all
of
its
faults
it
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
just
not
what
im
looking
for
i
will
not
be
trying
this
beer
again
but
i
am
sure
thier
are
many
people
who
enjoy
this
beerits
just
not
my
thing
the
beer
starts
out
ok
but
then
it
takes
a
turn
and
its
something
i
would
drink
its
a
better
offering
from
ab
then
i
thought
it
would
be
i
was
at
jillians
on
lansdowne
st
and
all
they
have
on
tap
is
sam
bud
guinness
stella
and
shock
top
i
thought
id
try
st
for
the
hell
of
it
served
in
a
plastic
pint
glass
nice
with
a
soggy
orange
slice
looked
pretty
average
smelled
like
floor
cleaner
so
that
was
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
tasted
like
a
weak
attempt
at
an
orange
flavored
witbier
again
nothing
special
mouthfeel
was
the
worst
aspect
of
this
beer
it
was
way
too
sugary
and
sticky
sweet
on
your
palate
bit
of
advice
dont
let
this
beer
warm
up
it
only
tastes
worse
this
brew
is
drinkable
but
i
would
not
order
it
again
luckily
we
left
after
i
finished
this
one
despite
my
rating
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
session
beers
its
fun
its
easy
and
i
dont
feel
exhausted
after
having
more
than
my
share
my
brew
was
served
at
what
felt
like
40
degrees
f
as
it
warmed
it
smelled
like
a
peeled
orange
45
feet
away
theres
not
much
else
to
say
about
this
its
a
ok
white
and
one
that
has
my
macro
drinking
friends
want
to
try
the
new
and
different
beers
that
i
bring
by
i
have
to
say
thi
beer
is
not
bad
by
any
means
i
recommend
it
to
those
interested
in
trying
a
witbier
brewed
by
one
of
the
big
boys
anheuserbusch
made
a
pretty
solid
attempt
at
a
wheat
beer
probably
not
quite
on
the
level
as
blue
moon
or
hoegaarden
but
still
a
tasty
beer
appearance
is
probably
not
quite
as
dark
of
an
orange
as
blue
moon
but
still
smells
and
tastes
good
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
roughly
the
same
price
range
as
blue
moon
if
you
like
wheat
beers
really
cant
go
wrong
with
any
that
ive
tried
and
shock
top
is
no
different
witbiers
arent
a
style
i
usually
go
for
so
i
dont
have
much
to
compare
it
to
pretty
weak
overall
though
although
i
dont
find
it
offensive
would
be
nice
on
a
summer
day
after
some
yard
work
etc
shock
top
is
a
refreshing
non
offending
mild
offering
that
i
could
see
being
quite
popular
in
especially
in
the
summer
i
would
never
turn
one
down
if
offered
to
me
but
i
doubt
i
would
be
buying
many
this
six
pack
was
a
gift
from
a
coworker
and
im
glad
ive
had
the
chance
to
try
it
on
a
par
with
blue
moon
from
what
i
remember
of
that
beer
and
found
at
plenty
of
watering
holes
md
no
bitterness
fruity
and
sweet
on
the
way
down
with
some
fizz
from
the
carb
a
step
below
medium
bodied
which
is
bigger
than
most
wits
ive
come
across
this
is
not
something
that
i
would
consume
for
refreshment
in
the
summer
needs
to
take
a
step
down
in
body
and
increase
the
spicewheat
and
bring
down
the
citrus
overallnotes
not
too
much
to
say
about
this
one
for
comparisons
sake
ill
just
call
it
an
inferior
blue
moon
if
you
find
yourself
with
only
the
bmc
alternatives
this
could
be
a
good
choice
d
a
decent
ale
much
better
than
i
expected
it
to
be
i
thought
this
wasnt
too
bad
though
it
wasnt
much
different
from
their
regular
american
lagers
smells
too
similar
to
bmc
stuff
as
well
taste
leaves
a
bad
clove
tobacco
and
non
hoppy
kind
of
citrus
taste
in
your
mouth
like
someone
put
a
cigarrette
out
on
a
lemon
and
then
threw
it
in
your
beer
mouthfeel
you
just
want
to
get
it
out
it
doesnt
develop
it
gets
worse
and
thus
isnt
too
drinkable
drinkability
i
was
expecting
something
along
the
lines
of
the
other
macro
witbier
blue
moon
but
shock
top
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
i
didnt
expect
much
and
it
failed
to
reach
even
those
expectations
this
is
just
above
a
drainpour
from
a
drinkability
standpoint
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
smooth
enough
to
drink
several
but
refined
enough
to
save
for
a
desert
beer
poured
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
glass
cloudy
yellow
with
little
head
and
not
much
lacing
aroma
of
oranges
come
through
you
are
overloaded
with
orange
lemon
and
lime
flavors
which
i
was
prepared
for
actually
found
it
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
thought
it
was
good
but
beware
if
you
dont
like
fruit
in
your
beer
stay
clear
of
this
one
drinkability
is
average
d
nothing
much
to
say
about
this
beer
the
only
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
is
its
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
and
you
could
drink
a
good
quantity
of
it
maybe
ok
for
a
summer
party
d
best
skipped
nothing
remarkable
about
this
one
what
was
that
this
beer
has
a
strong
cereal
flavor
to
it
there
is
a
citrusy
flavor
in
the
front
of
the
mouth
im
really
confused
its
bland
followed
by
citrus
followed
by
a
wheaty
flavor
and
then
a
strong
aftertaste
i
dont
like
this
beer
review
done
look
was
a
murky
gold
color
wasnt
bad
looking
but
not
great
either
lets
just
say
unless
it
calls
for
desperate
times
im
probably
not
reaching
for
that
cool
smiling
orange
slice
again
citrusy
yes
but
it
could
use
an
orange
or
two
more
drinkable
and
tasty
for
a
macro
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
this
is
a
good
beer
for
people
who
arent
living
in
the
real
beer
world
yet
and
need
to
take
the
first
step
good
in
the
summertime
light
beer
filmy
aftertaste
this
is
bad
drinkability
is
about
average
not
because
its
great
but
would
go
down
well
in
mass
quantities
from
a
pitcher
i
almost
sorta
kinda
like
it
a
bit
but
im
hoping
theres
a
prize
at
the
bottom
decent
offering
from
one
of
the
big
boys
comparable
to
blue
moon
d
i
havent
drink
many
beers
from
michelob
but
this
one
is
very
good
drinkability
very
drinkable
beer
kinda
like
water
drinkability
if
i
wanted
lemonade
then
i
would
have
bought
that
this
is
a
pretty
standard
belgian
white
brewed
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
crisp
spiciness
to
the
smell
with
some
citrusy
and
bready
notes
taste
is
spicy
orangey
cerealy
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
and
juicy
drinkability
is
fine
as
well
id
put
this
a
little
higher
on
the
list
of
bws
ive
tried
actually
good
orange
taste
the
blend
is
nice
in
the
mouth
with
orange
hitting
you
first
then
some
more
subtle
spices
coming
in
next
its
very
drinkable
and
i
could
see
myself
definitely
bringing
a
six
of
this
to
a
party
got
this
off
of
a
sample
pack
wish
i
had
more
than
one
beer
to
sample
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
has
some
hints
of
citrus
and
spices
taste
is
flavorful
and
refreshing
good
balance
of
spices
and
citrus
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
very
easily
overall
this
is
a
quality
brew
d
eh
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
i
have
had
this
on
tap
before
at
a
sports
bar
again
eh
drinkability
high
drinkability
can
suck
theese
down
all
day
d
while
i
could
really
drink
this
all
evening
or
on
the
patio
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
just
dont
feel
that
this
is
on
the
same
level
compared
to
the
hoegaardens
of
the
world
its
an
attempt
though
and
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
it
due
to
its
easy
drinking
character
drinkability
not
impressed
definitely
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
try
this
you
could
do
worse
but
you
could
also
do
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
poured
a
cloudy
dark
yellow
with
moderate
white
head
aroma
of
sweet
citrus
spice
and
hint
of
malt
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
up
to
par
with
other
macro
witbier
wannabees
but
much
more
pleasant
than
a
pale
adjunct
lager
a
decent
session
beer
drinkability
i
wont
be
buying
shock
top
again
but
ill
have
a
heart
since
college
football
started
its
inoffensive
and
drinkable
which
it
is
d
a
pretty
bland
wit
goes
down
and
easy
and
its
unoffensive
but
there
are
too
many
better
wits
to
come
back
to
this
one
d
very
drinkable
i
think
thats
what
bud
was
going
for
with
this
kinda
bland
kinda
weird
feeling
but
definitely
sessionable
drinkability
more
like
grossability
avoid
i
will
say
it
was
refreshing
for
the
condition
i
was
in
though
i
would
not
seek
this
out
ever
once
i
found
out
it
was
made
by
anheuserbusch
when
i
got
home
it
all
made
sense
notes
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
beach
and
i
can
definitely
say
it
was
better
out
of
the
bottle
for
one
it
was
colder
and
two
i
poured
mine
with
a
head
unlike
the
bartender
d
highish
because
its
watery
but
its
kind
of
a
blah
beer
for
me
good
for
a
summer
day
i
guess
d
although
my
review
of
blue
moon
having
taken
place
during
my
ba
infancy
probably
doesnt
reflect
it
i
feel
that
shock
top
holds
up
pretty
well
in
comparison
i
cant
say
for
sure
which
id
prefer
obviously
neither
is
a
world
beater
theyre
both
macro
interpretations
of
an
already
crowdfriendly
style
but
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
this
works
pretty
well
a
good
effort
for
a
macro
brewers
to
try
and
make
something
resembling
if
in
looks
alone
a
low
level
witbier
if
this
is
the
best
the
bar
yourre
at
has
order
it
otherwise
steer
clear
pours
like
a
slightly
more
orangetinted
bmc
offering
smell
is
macro
with
some
citrus
on
top
taste
bud
heavy
with
orange
goes
down
smooth
very
drinkable
if
not
flavorful
for
some
reason
this
tastes
much
better
to
me
right
out
of
the
bottle
more
hops
and
citrus
this
one
i
just
poured
is
pretty
underwhelming
eh
soso
tastes
very
similar
to
blue
moon
to
me
but
the
coriander
is
more
pronounced
about
the
same
in
terms
of
quality
not
very
bad
but
there
are
so
many
better
witbiers
out
there
this
is
fairly
drinkable
but
i
would
not
want
to
buy
this
again
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
color
with
a
one
finger
white
head
the
smell
is
of
grain
with
a
hint
of
some
fruit
but
it
is
very
faint
the
taste
is
grain
up
front
and
some
orange
on
the
back
end
but
the
taste
is
slightly
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
good
the
beer
is
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
the
overall
drinkability
is
okay
its
not
as
complex
as
a
micro
but
for
a
macro
a
decent
job
i
will
give
them
credit
for
the
effort
give
it
up
to
the
best
damn
beer
anheiser
busch
makes
naw
this
isnt
the
worst
beer
just
one
for
less
sophisticated
tastes
but
just
like
blue
moon
did
if
it
can
open
the
eyes
of
an
inexperienced
beer
drinker
lets
use
this
one
to
our
advantage
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
reasonably
drinkable
i
would
not
necessarily
seek
it
out
but
given
the
selection
on
tap
on
this
day
it
was
a
good
choice
d
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
could
easily
have
see
drinking
several
on
a
hot
night
but
i
wouldnt
be
buying
for
the
price
like
7
50
a
six
i
can
think
of
much
better
beers
and
fresca
would
be
just
as
refreshing
i
didnt
know
anheuserbusch
made
this
when
i
saw
it
in
bars
sneaky
bastards
leave
it
to
ab
to
do
a
great
job
of
selling
this
crap
via
billboards
i
had
to
try
it
seeing
all
the
hype
its
even
worst
than
blue
moon
if
you
want
a
good
bw
go
with
sam
adams
imperial
white
or
hoegaarden
this
style
has
not
been
reproduced
well
by
any
of
the
macrobreweries
and
its
a
shame
as
it
is
great
summer
beer
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
in
that
it
is
thin
and
refreshing
although
not
what
you
would
seek
in
looking
for
flavorful
witbier
conclusion
its
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
by
ab
it
might
be
good
for
getting
your
macrodrinking
friends
to
expand
their
horizons
a
bit
and
branch
out
towards
craft
that
being
said
while
its
not
really
bad
in
any
way
id
definitely
take
a
celis
or
hoegaarden
above
this
which
are
both
win
about
the
same
price
range
and
annihilate
this
on
quality
it
is
a
much
lighter
version
of
a
white
ale
about
the
quality
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
the
anheuserbusch
company
better
than
most
really
cheap
beers
but
cant
really
hold
its
own
against
others
in
its
style
i
would
have
another
but
it
would
not
be
my
beer
of
choice
i
would
recommend
this
to
someone
who
is
used
to
really
light
bodied
beers
and
would
like
to
transition
into
heavier
styles
i
guess
it
isnt
horrible
but
i
would
only
drink
it
again
if
it
is
free
d
yeah
its
a
decent
bmc
summer
beer
if
you
want
to
escape
the
normal
adjunct
lager
with
out
paying
very
much
more
but
it
certainly
is
a
poor
example
of
the
style
t
the
lemon
came
through
so
that
obviously
changes
the
experience
fairly
solid
drink
nothing
that
really
comes
out
your
traditional
wheat
smells
like
orange
and
lemon
with
a
mix
of
wheat
nothing
special
tastes
similar
not
much
to
either
just
felt
like
a
watered
down
wheat
pretty
plain
not
much
to
say
this
brew
will
not
offend
anyone
but
will
not
impress
anyone
either
a
drinkable
beer
that
maybe
would
be
a
decent
intro
brew
to
bring
to
a
party
where
macro
beer
drinkers
dwell
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
its
got
that
yellow
banana
aroma
in
the
nose
paired
with
a
belgianesque
yeast
note
sweet
and
somewhat
artifical
in
flavor
banana
obviously
is
dominant
some
mild
spice
and
a
small
citrus
blast
on
the
late
finish
it
leaves
a
long
slightly
bitter
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
not
terrible
by
any
means
its
sweetness
adds
some
serious
weight
when
sitting
in
the
stomach
appearance
and
smell
were
average
but
the
taste
had
just
enough
citrusspice
to
be
better
than
i
expected
and
deserving
a
review
perhaps
only
because
it
was
on
tap
very
drinkable
on
this
hot
summer
day
i
had
two
ive
been
avoiding
this
beer
ever
since
i
saw
it
i
was
afraid
i
would
like
it
and
have
to
support
the
bmc
juggernauts
well
this
was
offered
to
me
free
so
i
couldnt
refuse
it
looks
good
outta
the
gate
nice
orange
color
with
2
inch
head
the
smell
was
very
fruity
dominated
by
orange
citrus
the
taste
wasnt
that
bad
st
i
knew
it
fruity
wheat
beers
just
get
me
i
could
see
poundin
a
few
of
these
but
i
wont
allow
myself
to
be
tempted
by
the
evil
ab
empire
it
seems
this
is
what
ab
was
going
for
that
doesnt
make
it
that
great
though
beer
was
moderately
carbonated
which
gave
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
good
flavor
was
pretty
tame
for
a
wit
i
could
sense
the
orange
rind
lemon
zest
and
slight
peppery
finish
but
it
was
all
toned
down
because
of
the
mild
nature
of
this
beer
though
drinkability
is
higher
in
my
mind
i
could
down
a
few
of
these
at
a
barbecue
for
sure
hazy
bleach
blonde
body
with
a
big
airy
head
that
lasts
for
a
while
and
leaves
a
few
blobs
of
lace
behind
the
nose
is
lime
zestwheat
malt
and
coriander
citrus
peel
overripe
banana
and
mild
belgian
spice
flavors
with
a
sugar
cookie
finish
an
okay
summer
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
watery
and
thin
a
lot
of
the
summer
seasonals
i
encounter
blur
the
line
between
american
pale
wheat
ale
and
witbier
this
is
one
of
those
d
with
the
above
being
said
i
could
slam
these
since
they
werent
very
fizzy
or
tasty
to
me
overall
worthwhile
and
worth
the
purchase
ive
had
better
witbiers
though
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
myself
tossing
a
few
back
without
thinking
twice
i
didnt
expect
that
it
would
be
this
good
to
be
honest
i
was
impressed
and
it
caught
me
off
guard
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
cheers
drinkability
not
recommended
an
allout
assault
on
coors
blue
moon
that
utterly
fails
in
my
opinion
its
just
a
far
too
thin
and
lacking
in
all
its
qualities
making
for
a
rather
unrewarding
wit
fairly
good
value
drinkability
id
say
prety
good
if
you
like
the
flavors
i
know
people
that
dont
like
citrus
as
much
and
they
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
but
if
you
like
it
than
id
say
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
it
get
to
be
too
much
not
something
id
drink
all
day
though
certainly
not
a
classic
but
hand
me
a
couple
of
these
after
transplanting
some
trees
in
the
yard
and
im
a
happy
man
i
can
see
this
appealing
to
young
girls
and
crossover
beer
drinkers
who
are
trying
to
seem
worldly
but
even
as
far
as
uninspired
pale
wheats
go
this
one
is
near
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
d
this
is
an
ok
beer
nice
for
a
session
and
decent
for
socializing
its
not
exactly
a
prime
example
of
a
wit
but
it
does
its
job
as
a
thirst
quencher
pours
a
hazy
pale
orange
smell
is
faintly
of
citrus
taste
is
watery
slightly
tart
and
a
hint
of
malt
and
citrus
mouthfeel
is
thin
very
high
carbonation
somewhat
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
poor
example
of
a
witbier
though
just
barely
above
a
light
lager
i
would
rather
take
a
macro
lager
over
this
for
the
money
this
is
not
worth
it
much
better
examples
out
there
i
wont
actively
seek
it
out
again
but
wont
turn
my
nose
up
at
it
either
d
i
guess
it
is
refreshing
but
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
row
i
would
not
want
it
would
be
too
much
orangy
flavor
for
me
d
very
refreshing
i
wouldnt
buy
a
6pack
and
if
i
had
a
choice
of
this
macro
and
blue
moon
id
choose
blue
moon
that
said
this
is
very
refreshing
and
worth
an
order
at
a
bar
if
there
is
nothing
else
to
drink
d
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
i
can
see
having
one
or
two
on
a
hot
day
its
just
not
interesting
and
there
are
better
options
to
be
had
i
was
hoping
for
some
coriander
to
add
some
bite
and
sharpness
overall
not
a
bad
beer
its
light
could
be
a
good
drink
with
seafood
for
what
its
worth
i
would
take
this
over
any
other
anheuserbusch
product
any
day
overall
a
really
bad
witbier
effort
terrible
dont
recommend
and
definitely
one
and
done
for
me
why
did
they
even
bother
with
this
one
drinkability
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
may
get
a
little
tiresome
after
two
beers
though
i
can
see
how
this
would
appeal
to
a
lot
of
people
drank
while
in
hawaii
on
tap
the
color
was
a
very
light
hazy
yellow
with
very
little
foam
and
no
lace
the
smell
of
sweet
citrus
filled
the
nose
with
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
had
the
flavor
of
orange
and
a
touch
of
lime
the
finish
had
a
little
tart
feel
on
the
palate
because
of
the
citrus
flavor
and
finish
not
a
bad
beer
pleasant
to
have
dinner
with
again
for
a
belgian
witbier
this
is
definitely
lacking
for
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beverage
on
a
hot
day
this
isnt
too
bad
its
definitely
a
step
up
from
an
adjunct
lager
hopefully
it
can
help
some
people
by
being
a
gateway
into
craft
beers
this
beer
is
from
the
michelob
wheat
beer
sampler
pours
a
cloudy
carbonated
orangegold
color
pretty
nice
looking
head
on
this
one
this
beer
has
a
pleasant
flavor
with
wheat
and
hints
of
citrus
coming
through
in
the
finish
this
beer
while
not
as
complex
as
other
offerings
is
quite
refreshing
in
its
own
right
while
hanging
out
with
some
buds
at
a
local
pub
this
beer
was
the
best
one
available
sometimes
we
take
what
we
can
get
drinkability
meh
not
much
going
on
here
not
bad
to
drink
but
not
great
either
more
like
a
citrus
soda
than
a
belgian
wit
dont
think
it
will
give
blue
moon
a
run
for
its
money
let
alone
a
true
belgian
this
is
quite
thin
stuff
especially
if
it
sits
for
any
length
of
time
above
five
minutes
at
first
its
ok
but
it
becomes
less
firm
as
carbonation
dies
down
it
tastes
like
a
sweet
wit
with
orange
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
and
a
bit
generic
yeasty
aroma
has
a
decided
citrus
overtone
mainly
orange
it
comes
out
of
the
bottle
a
hazy
golden
with
not
much
white
head
flavor
is
wheaty
and
has
a
firm
undertone
of
lemon
and
orange
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
just
slightly
fizzy
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
a
try
keep
in
mind
i
just
had
an
allagash
white
and
now
i
am
comparing
a
shock
top
i
poured
into
a
nonic
to
a
half
inch
of
head
which
quickly
went
away
it
looked
good
there
is
not
much
of
a
smell
faint
citrus
i
wish
i
could
say
that
it
had
some
taste
not
much
going
on
here
it
felt
watery
and
i
guess
it
could
be
drinkable
but
why
when
i
can
have
allagash
overall
pretty
average
i
would
prefer
more
flavor
one
of
their
better
beers
but
if
you
cant
make
a
wheat
beer
your
in
the
wrong
business
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
thin
beige
head
the
nose
has
wheatish
malts
and
the
usual
stale
hops
again
more
staleness
in
the
taste
watery
body
goes
down
with
harsh
carbonation
drinkabilty
like
this
one
alot
more
then
i
remembered
or
thought
i
actually
would
for
someone
whos
not
always
a
huge
fan
of
these
styles
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
of
the
style
a
nice
beer
for
a
nice
warm
summer
nite
a
little
sweet
but
still
one
i
could
picture
as
an
ocassional
sessioner
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
on
a
warm
night
a
better
beer
from
michelob
d
very
light
for
a
white
very
drinkable
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
decent
looking
white
head
but
not
much
retention
smell
orange
lemony
wheat
tanginess
and
grainy
michelob
pale
malt
character
taste
lightly
bready
with
vague
sweet
citrus
and
spice
very
light
perhaps
too
light
mouthfeel
light
and
fizzy
ehh
in
general
i
prefer
my
wheats
of
the
weizen
variety
instead
of
wits
and
ab
certainly
did
wits
no
favors
with
this
one
did
i
like
it
yeah
i
did
is
it
one
i
would
try
again
hmmm
dont
know
but
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
grab
a
free
one
some
place
id
probably
jump
at
the
chance
credit
where
credits
deserved
good
brew
ab
poured
this
into
a
bud
light
pint
glass
in
order
to
keep
with
the
ab
theme
hazy
orange
appearance
with
a
fluffy
head
that
disappeared
quite
quickly
typical
witbier
scent
though
somewhat
muted
as
for
the
taste
i
think
most
give
this
no
chance
because
its
from
a
macro
trying
their
hand
at
a
craft
type
beer
while
there
are
most
certainly
many
better
witbiers
this
one
has
its
niche
the
flavors
are
obviously
toned
down
to
please
the
masses
its
very
drinkable
and
id
certainly
rather
down
a
few
of
these
during
a
round
of
golf
over
bud
light
d
could
i
easily
pound
these
all
day
yes
would
i
like
to
no
there
are
far
better
beers
on
the
market
to
waste
my
time
drinking
this
again
yes
this
is
drinkable
i
was
afaid
of
this
beer
because
i
had
heard
bad
things
guess
what
dont
believe
everything
that
you
hear
this
was
the
saving
grace
of
the
sampler
d
this
beer
is
97
the
same
as
blue
moon
and
unfortunately
for
ab
that
other
3
is
not
as
good
as
blue
moon
a
bit
too
wheaty
some
how
and
the
aroma
is
just
not
perfumey
enough
for
the
style
good
enough
to
wash
down
pizza
with
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
be
sitting
around
drinking
this
by
itself
the
folks
at
yellow
dog
included
a
slice
of
orange
with
this
beer
without
my
asking
for
it
normally
i
find
that
annoying
but
in
this
case
i
was
glad
for
the
slice
of
orange
it
was
much
tastier
then
the
beer
and
helped
to
clean
my
palate
afterwards
as
promisedwheat
oranges
and
lemon
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
a
moderate
wheaty
malt
backbonesome
citrus
fruitlemonorangeand
a
hint
of
hoppy
spicemedium
carbonationfruity
aftertastequite
sessionable
overall
not
offensive
but
i
drink
a
lot
of
oberon
and
this
falls
way
short
of
that
mark
slight
citrus
aroma
in
the
glass
the
beer
looks
like
a
wheat
should
i
guess
cloudy
as
far
as
flavour
goes
its
not
really
my
kind
of
beer
but
for
what
it
is
i
guess
its
ok
one
pint
was
enough
i
switched
to
yuengling
got
this
on
tap
at
outback
decided
to
try
it
i
normally
do
not
like
a
beer
with
a
fruity
taste
im
a
beer
that
taste
like
beer
guy
honestly
it
was
good
had
to
have
a
second
glass
taste
was
smooth
went
down
well
had
that
hint
of
fruit
flavor
but
didnt
overpower
me
would
order
again
drinkability
overall
not
good
for
peopel
who
like
beer
but
a
great
crossover
beer
from
macros
especially
if
they
like
blue
moon
brew
was
a
cloudy
light
yellow
a
little
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
not
much
had
about
a
half
inch
head
that
didnt
last
long
minimal
lacing
at
best
had
a
slight
lemon
citrus
smell
also
a
little
malt
caught
the
nose
tasted
a
little
sweet
and
also
had
a
lemon
flavor
if
not
lemon
then
definatly
citrus
just
a
slight
bitter
taste
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
about
right
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
make
it
a
session
beer
with
the
lemon
flavor
i
think
that
someone
that
drank
wine
coolers
might
enjoy
this
one
the
review
for
this
beer
may
have
been
better
had
the
way
i
was
presented
this
beer
had
beer
better
having
any
beer
for
the
first
time
while
it
is
in
a
platic
cup
is
not
the
best
way
to
tasts
test
so
i
will
revise
my
review
in
the
future
overall
not
a
bad
beer
pretty
good
actually
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
decent
enough
to
grab
a
six
pack
of
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheaper
beer
with
class
paid
8
79
a
6
pack
i
had
it
on
tap
a
while
ago
at
busch
gardens
on
a
hot
summer
day
incidentally
and
recall
being
much
more
impressed
with
it
so
perhaps
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
d
it
has
the
same
drinkability
as
weve
come
to
love
from
bud
light
if
i
was
in
a
bind
craving
a
belgian
and
100
miles
away
from
a
good
one
this
would
do
far
better
choices
for
12
more
its
a
fun
beer
to
serve
due
to
roll
at
the
end
pour
instructions
the
opaque
sunny
color
and
the
pleasant
nose
for
the
kind
of
beer
it
is
an
ab
nearmainstream
beer
i
think
this
delivers
extremely
well
have
found
it
generally
is
a
far
better
compliment
to
americanmex
cooking
than
a
corona
with
lime
but
watch
out
with
some
foods
it
can
manifest
its
bitter
notes
unpleasantly
overall
there
was
way
too
much
orangefruity
flavor
going
on
here
i
wouldnt
want
to
buy
this
because
i
know
i
could
find
a
good
hefe
instead
this
is
a
mild
easy
drinking
white
but
still
has
alot
of
the
characters
you
look
for
just
a
little
watered
down
on
the
appearance
front
the
head
dwindles
fast
but
i
love
the
color
it
is
a
very
palecloudy
yellow
there
is
zero
lacing
taste
is
good
it
is
very
drinkable
i
like
it
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
practically
no
head
and
no
lacing
on
glass
unfortunately
it
came
with
and
orange
so
the
smell
was
dominated
by
that
all
i
could
smell
was
orange
and
again
the
orange
was
in
the
beer
so
the
taste
was
very
orangy
and
creamy
with
a
tiny
hop
flavor
and
no
bitterness
honestly
it
did
taste
pretty
good
im
a
big
fan
of
orange
creamsicles
and
this
beer
reminded
me
of
that
not
bad
not
a
complex
beer
but
tasty
and
very
drinkable
future
outlook
well
this
was
decent
for
the
style
but
certainly
nothing
to
jump
up
and
grab
you
unlike
their
hop
hound
wheat
this
one
might
actually
be
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
paying
12
price
it
was
very
drinkable
i
would
definitley
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
think
of
choosing
it
over
an
allagash
white
or
even
a
blue
moon
edit
2
had
ontap
again
still
has
the
body
of
soapy
water
and
almost
no
flavor
i
am
utterly
shocked
that
this
has
a
c
average
maybe
my
expectations
in
a
wit
are
too
high
d
3
5
its
a
bit
sweeter
than
some
more
traditional
witbiers
but
its
not
a
bad
try
for
ab
its
available
everywhere
and
its
usually
a
decent
price
i
order
up
a
shock
top
any
time
as
a
craft
alternative
if
a
bar
is
cursed
with
all
macro
offerings
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
theres
better
choices
out
there
you
wont
regret
it
if
you
buy
this
one
and
drinking
this
one
is
no
problem
but
you
would
be
better
served
by
blue
moon
or
hoegaarden
which
are
just
as
readily
available
and
taste
better
d
a
decent
attempt
at
a
nice
belgian
white
but
i
personally
would
stick
with
hoegaarden
or
blue
moon
cloudy
yellow
2
finger
head
belgian
white
really
im
not
getting
that
at
all
here
its
an
okay
beer
but
blue
moon
is
far
better
if
that
tells
you
anything
get
a
bit
of
orange
and
lemon
taste
but
this
is
way
to
carbonated
and
kills
it
for
me
mouthfeel
is
decent
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
smooth
finish
overall
a
very
easy
drinker
like
i
said
i
didnt
have
many
options
but
this
was
better
than
the
bud
light
and
rolling
rock
that
was
offered
had
a
couple
and
had
a
good
time
during
mardi
gras
man
they
almost
got
it
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
summertime
beer
that
quenches
the
thirst
and
doesnt
go
bad
with
citrus
fruit
like
lemon
or
orange
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
but
not
thin
and
watery
the
carbonation
works
well
with
the
beer
the
beer
is
pretty
smooth
this
is
definately
lawnmower
beer
i
could
see
sucking
down
several
of
these
in
an
evening
i
am
in
shock
extra
again
the
ale
had
a
lot
of
charisma
in
esthetics
the
beer
was
kinda
a
let
down
though
i
love
michelob
amber
bock
is
to
die
for
this
beer
had
all
the
flavors
for
a
good
complex
beer
but
just
was
not
abundant
enough
a
side
note
the
label
on
this
beer
was
amazing
totally
trippy
serving
type
bottle
poured
into
a
hefewiessen
glass
i
dont
believe
that
i
am
one
to
be
able
to
properly
indicate
what
flavors
i
taste
in
many
things
although
i
continue
to
learn
and
try
and
so
i
will
just
say
that
for
no
matter
what
the
money
you
may
be
asked
to
pay
for
this
beer
it
is
not
worth
it
unless
it
came
in
a
30pack
of
cans
for
ten
dollars
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
another
shock
top
belgian
white
very
easy
to
consume
not
exactly
the
worst
wit
ive
ever
had
but
not
too
impressive
overall
the
pouring
instructions
are
unique
especially
for
an
ab
brew
but
it
does
add
to
its
uniqueness
i
suppose
this
beer
really
lacks
a
good
balance
which
is
due
perhaps
to
the
overwhelming
amount
of
citrus
that
it
was
brewed
with
orangelemonand
lime
peels
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
faint
tangy
wheat
and
caramel
malt
there
is
no
hint
of
coriander
or
orange
peel
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
there
is
some
tangy
wheat
and
some
cardamom
but
no
coriander
or
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
a
horrible
example
of
a
witbier
and
it
is
really
hard
to
stomach
i
will
not
be
drinking
this
again
notes
decent
summertype
brew
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
fruit
overall
id
only
get
this
ontap
because
it
was
one
of
the
cheaper
beers
and
wasnt
american
adjunct
its
pretty
drinkable
for
the
most
part
and
is
crisp
and
refreshing
it
would
make
a
better
summer
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
is
yet
another
attempt
to
take
a
shot
at
the
blue
moon
marketshare
but
unfortunately
its
just
as
lacking
in
substance
its
poundable
but
its
not
one
that
id
pick
pours
out
an
extremely
hazy
yellow
brew
with
a
thin
head
looks
mildly
carbonated
not
too
much
in
the
smell
department
smells
of
light
spices
and
slightly
yeasty
the
taste
is
dumbed
downbut
i
enjoy
it
very
subtle
orange
notesnot
very
much
else
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
thin
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
be
an
excellent
lawnmower
beer
could
be
used
to
slowly
convert
a
friend
to
craft
beers
poured
into
a
14
oz
wheat
glass
golden
hue
with
plenty
of
haze
and
a
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
had
a
strong
citrus
notes
and
lime
orange
dominated
tasted
slightlly
hoppy
and
was
easy
to
drink
has
a
nice
mild
finish
would
be
a
decent
beer
for
a
sunny
spring
or
summer
day
poured
this
beer
and
it
appeared
with
a
wheat
colored
that
was
cloudy
the
white
foam
head
that
it
first
originally
poured
with
did
settle
quickly
and
left
almost
no
traces
of
lacing
the
aroma
that
wafted
up
from
the
beer
was
that
of
a
belgian
style
beer
with
hints
of
the
oranges
the
taste
of
the
beer
followed
suit
which
the
flavoring
of
a
ab
beer
having
this
good
of
a
fullness
was
a
surprise
that
i
am
sure
to
recommend
to
others
that
are
looking
for
that
light
beer
pretty
good
overall
pretty
good
flavor
and
nose
i
really
like
the
orange
hints
it
pretty
much
tastes
like
it
smells
light
drink
with
an
okay
feel
very
solid
quaff
originally
i
said
that
i
didnt
think
id
stick
with
this
one
and
would
try
something
else
now
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
beers
i
will
be
mixing
up
my
purchases
with
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
refreshing
in
the
summer
though
not
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
served
ontap
looked
like
your
standard
summer
brew
with
all
the
smells
and
appearance
repleit
with
the
orange
slice
from
there
it
went
down
hill
the
taste
wasnt
offensive
it
was
just
virtual
nonexistent
like
the
actual
beer
had
been
watered
down
with
well
water
maybe
it
was
because
it
was
snowing
outside
and
the
middle
of
december
but
i
wasnt
that
excited
by
this
effort
seems
like
a
attempt
to
cashin
on
the
whole
beer
with
an
orange
slice
fad
im
sure
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
i
just
really
wouldnt
want
to
wake
me
up
when
you
have
something
interesting
note
used
to
be
known
as
spring
heat
spiced
wheat
if
you
like
blue
moon
give
this
on
a
shot
if
you
are
a
hoegraden
fan
it
may
or
may
not
impress
your
taste
buds
drinkability
average
beer
but
a
subpar
attempt
at
of
the
style
i
would
probably
just
spend
the
few
extra
bucks
to
pick
up
some
blue
moon
md
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
cheap
inexpensive
belgian
style
would
recommend
to
serve
it
to
a
new
beer
drinker
to
try
to
turn
them
on
to
this
style
of
brew
notes
im
not
apposed
to
anheuserbusch
beers
ill
try
them
and
give
them
a
fair
shot
but
this
one
really
missed
the
mark
draft
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
but
no
orange
slice
on
the
side
pours
an
orangish
yellow
color
body
chilled
haze
and
cloudy
has
a
large
and
creamy
white
head
not
much
lace
or
retentionm
spicy
yeasty
aroma
and
some
orange
coming
through
some
wheat
flavor
along
with
the
yeast
and
spiciness
no
really
strong
flavors
lots
of
citrus
orange
slight
hoppy
finish
thin
and
a
bit
of
a
watery
mouthfeel
not
too
bad
no
complaints
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
popular
choice
from
watching
the
bartender
drinkability
is
moderate
its
not
unpalateable
just
not
to
style
for
me
i
cant
see
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
purchase
it
again
i
would
drink
one
if
someone
handed
it
to
me
though
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
singlefinger
fluffy
head
the
smell
is
mostly
orange
and
spices
the
taste
starts
off
with
sweet
orange
that
gives
way
to
some
spices
and
bready
yeast
that
lingers
on
the
palate
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
some
fine
carbonation
its
a
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
but
kind
of
a
onenote
interpretation
of
the
style
aroma
is
fruity
but
overpowering
pours
cloudy
orange
with
a
small
white
head
strong
overpowering
carbonation
flavor
was
a
bit
watery
very
citrus
overall
not
bad
especially
for
an
anheuserbusch
brew
but
there
are
better
whites
out
there
pours
clear
and
bright
orangeyellow
with
a
decent
white
head
nice
wheaty
and
sweet
aroma
but
just
a
little
thin
the
taste
is
the
same
leans
more
on
the
american
wheat
side
but
spiced
the
carbonation
is
out
of
control
its
like
drinking
a
shakenup
club
soda
not
great
but
also
not
bad
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
slight
to
average
head
little
lacing
and
the
head
quickly
disappears
strong
fruit
smell
with
a
noticeable
coriander
mixed
with
the
cleanliness
of
a
lager
the
fruit
flavor
is
lacking
in
the
flavor
and
it
is
more
or
less
a
lager
a
light
beer
with
slight
carbonation
easy
to
drink
but
the
fruit
flavor
is
to
weak
poured
to
a
cloudy
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
lingered
awhile
and
left
okay
lacing
nose
was
essentially
nonexistent
except
for
a
whiff
of
orange
and
bubblegum
at
the
very
outset
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
yet
neither
tangy
nor
spicy
like
i
would
expect
and
the
taste
was
bland
not
an
overall
bad
drinking
beer
but
just
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
in
the
way
of
a
belgian
witbier
served
freezing
cold
and
it
was
hard
to
taste
anything
waited
to
warm
up
a
bit
before
tasting

opaque

that
is
lasting
spicy
orangy
aroma
with
some
wheat
some
hoppiness
in
the
aroma
too
watery
creamy
palate
some
orange
flavor
not
a
very
strong
flavor
some
sweet
spiciness
in
the
taste
not
too
bad
actually
but
it
could
use
a
little
more
flavor

nothing
offensive
or
interesting
going
on
here
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
from
a
711
store
wow
was
i
surprised
i
was
a
little
wary
after
seeing
it
was
made
by
ab
but
wow
this
turned
out
to
be
a
nice
surprise
pours
a
light
lightly
cloudy
amber
color
has
a
nice
head
that
stayed
around
longer
than
i
thought
it
would
tasted
lightly
of
orange
mango
and
corlander
i
do
not
usualy
like
fruity
tasting
beers
but
this
one
was
just
right
it
was
very
refreshing
and
really
good
i
have
no
problem
buying
another
6
pack
of
this
surprisingly
good
beer
d
these
are
easy
to
pound
back
but
the
spices
in
the
brew
could
hurt
your
stomach
later
not
bad
for
a
bmc
brew
on
tap
at
applebees
morgantown
wv
d
i
can
see
maybe
having
one
of
these
on
a
patio
or
on
a
hot
day
when
you
have
a
thirst
but
the
orange
flavor
just
seems
too
much
it
doesnt
show
any
character
it
just
tastes
flavored
if
that
makes
any
sense
not
something
i
would
look
for
having
again

not
a
very
impressive
beer
drinkability
is
low
this
isnt
a
great
quality
to
begin
with
and
the
fact
that
it
tastes
artificial
makes
it
worse
save
your
money
and
try
something
else
bottle
from
the
communal
fridge
d
pretty
drinkable
since
the
beer
is
so
simple
and
goes
down
so
easy
it
makes
it
easy
to
drink
one
after

the

i
was
kinda
syked
about
this
brew
with
the
nose
but
the
taste
is
pretty
blandwatery
a
big
disappointment
d
easy
and
light
some
flavor
to
it
not
bad
at
all
a
fair
summer
sipper
love
the
logo
on
the
bottle
btw
an
orange
with
a
wheat
mohawk
and
sunglasses
very
cool
look
i
wont
be
purchasing
this
beer
ever
again
plop
me
in
a
beach
chair
stick
one
of
these
in
my
hand
with
an
orange
slice
and
ill
watch
some
bikinis
stroll
by
to
bad
its
october
damn
it
had
it
on
tap
while
having
dinner
at
applebees
the
appearance
was
an
incredibly
murky
yellow
look
with
some
pretty
good
lacing
on
the
sides
thin
head
aromas
were
ok
not
too
strong
but
also
too
conservative
than
i
would
expect
the
taste
was
comfortably
subtle
in
bitterness
with
a
little
offmetallic
taste
lemon
flavors
mixed
with
some
slight
biscuit
hints
i
did
find
it
really
refreshing
but
a
little
on
the
light
watery
side
overall
not
a
bad
drink
anyway
so
now
im
slightly
pissed
off
the
reason
i
brought
up
the
seasonality
of
the
beer
is
because
at
first
i
thought
it
might
have
been
the
end
of
the
keg
my
2nd
thought
after
i
taste
the
beer
is
that
they
must
not
sell
much
of
this
stuff
because
it
tasted
as
if
it
had
come
from
a
dirty
tap
or
that
just
could
be
par
for
the
course
for
this
stuff
it
looked
like
your
typical
belgian
white
not
as
cloudy
as
some
of
the
better
ones
allagash
etc
but
it
just
tasted
a
little
off
again
ive
never
had
this
beer
before
and
probably
wont
again
it
had
a
stale
taste
to
it
that
wasnt
very
pleasing
i
soldiered
on
and
finished
the
beer
since
i
had
already
paid
some
outrageous
price
for
a
34
glass
of
beer
i
think
the
favorite
part
of
drinking
a
belgian
out
of
a
bottle
is
the
extra
yummy
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
this
is
hard
to
duplicate
in
a
tap
beer
d
wasnt
going
into
this
with
any
expectations
didnt
come
out
with
anything
positive
worst
beer
ive
had
since
i
started
reviewing
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
a
decent
brew
when
you
have
limited
selections
at
a
bar
and
want
something
that
goes
down
easy
good
on
a
hot
day
i
prefer
it
to
blue
moon
poured
from
12
oz
bottle
to
weizen
glass
a
dense
cloudy
yellow
gold
with
two
inches
of
white
foam
head
that
settled
to
a
quarter
inch
with
some
spotty
lacing
expected
a
strong
orange
smell
from
the
mohawked
orange
on
the
label
but
not
much
in
the
nose
just
a
hint
of
wheat
and
citrus
weak
taste
here
of
wheat
and
mild
citrus
it
had
good
carbonation
and
was
very
easy
drinking
this
is
ok
at
best
not
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
and
the
false
promotion
of
orange
dominance
did
not
help
it
in
my
scoring
its
a
bit
stickier
at
the
lips
than
your
normal
beer
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
was
a
little
heavy
in
the
middle
for
my
personal
choice
drinkability
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
and
i
would
drink
it
again
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
not
a
great
deal
of
head
smell
was
pleasantly
spicey
taste
was
better
then
blue
moon
having
alot
of
fruit
and
spices
going
on
in
the
finish
but
it
had
a
bitter
taste
that
seems
to
be
trademark
in
every
macrobrewed
beer
ive
ever
had
mouthfeel
was
very
bubbly
the
carbonation
got
me
quite
bloated
still
i
wouldnt
have
minded
a
second
in
my
oppinion
its
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
it
is
a
pleasent
drinkable
white
beer
overall
seems
to
be
a
fairly
mild
entry
into
the
style
may
be
good
for
someone
trying
to
branch
into
this
type
of
beer
as
they
wont
be
overpowered
by
spices
andor
yeast
but
there
is
enough
of
these
components
to
give
a
glimpse
of
what
is
possible
in
this
type
of
beer
i
wish
people
didnt
know
this
was
an
ab
product
because
i
thought
it
was
a
great
beer
much
better
than
other
wits
ive
had
from
more
prestigious
micros
so
damn
smooth
and
tasty
and
at
a
great
price
wha
more
can
you
ask
for
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
with
a
hoegarrden
or
some
other
good
representation
d
overall
this
is
average
drinking
at
best
surely
beats
most
if
not
all
other
ab
products
but
i
will
be
leary
of
this
one
as
well
not
disgusting
or
offensive
but
not
wow
either
my
fellow
reviewers
make
a
good
point
i
had
this
beer
pegged
higher
and
thought
folks
were
being
snobbish
at
first
then
the
palate
adjusted
and
the
beer
warmed
a
touch
and
it
went
from
pretty
decent
to
entirely
average
drinkability
an
average
wit
id
prefer
a
blue
moon
os
sunset
wheat
to
this
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
cloudy
light
orange
body
topped
with
a
twofinger
head
white
and
quickly
dissipating
thin
lacing
clings
desperately
to
the
glass
nose
is
mellow
wheat
yeast
citrus
a
touch
of
citrus
zest
some
mossiness
and
a
nearly
imperceptible
hint
of
coriander
taste
is
pale
wheat
orange
and
lemon
goes
down
easy
with
coriander
emerging
and
a
dry
and
short
finish
good
carbonation
but
the
body
is
thin
to
the
point
its
unenjoyable
overall
not
bad
refreshing
but
lacks
character
and
surpassed
by
nearly
every
other
beer
in
the
category
this
beer
certainly
stands
up
to
other
massproduced
american
white
ales
shock

is
anheuserbuschs
answer
to

blue

i
feel
that

a
good
beginning
introduction
to
a
belgian
style
white

actually
didnt
know
it

just
fyi
for
myself

enjoyable
enough
beer
not
overly
offensive
as
far
as
wit
beers
go
training
wheel
beers
i
like
to
call
these
not
my
style
to
begin
with
but
enjoyable
enough
on
a
hot
day
i
dont
care
for
the
slick
packaging
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
with
this
beer
there
are
plenty
of
adequate
wits
on
the
market
and
even
a
few
really
good
ones
i
would
not
have
this
again
boring
drinkability
would
probably
give
this
less
if
i
could
i
havent
felt
this
strongly
since
i
had
my
last
lightstruck
beer
only
this
one
didnt
taste
skunked
just
super
weak
d
not
world
class
but
it
would
have
higher
drink
points
if
the
mf
wasnt
so
offputting
d
this
is
okay
doesnt
taste
like
a
true
wit
more
like
an
american
pale
wheat
because
this
tasted
like
orange
soda
to
me
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
not
something
i
would
ever
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
again
but
worth
trying
once
for
the
experience
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
witbier
the
best
ab
craft
beer
i
have
tried
thus
far
very
easy
to
drink
great
for
summerspring
okay
beer
that
i
could
drink
when
better
choices
are
not
available
i
do
applaud
ab
for
trying
to
get
some
variety
in
their
approach
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
always
love
these
and
wish
every
bottle
had
one
one
finger
pure
white
head
quickly
faded
to
a
thin
layer
atop
my
brew
cloudy
banana
yellow
color
aromas
are
a
little
muted
and
the
citrus
is
hard
to
detect
esp
for
beer
sporting
an
orange
with
sunglasses
and
a
mohawk
on
the
label
the
flavors
are
a
little
more
defined
and
the
orange
does
come
though
along
with
some
lime
peel
underneath
and
a
little
wheat
too
sweet
for
the
style
and
the
spices
are
hard
to
detect
but
it
does
get
better
as
it
warms
up
light
body
and
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
but
carbonation
is
little
too
vibrant
good
effort
for
ab
and
a
good
alternative
for
those
who
do
drink
ab
products
and
want
some
variation
drinkability
i
didnt
know
it
was
an
ab
product
till
i
looked
at
the
lable
which
is
why
i
picked
it
up
anyway
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
and
being
over
5
abv
i
would
enjoy
it
allagash
white
from
portland
me
new
englandnortheast
bias
aside
is
strictly
the
best
american
interpretation
of
this
style
so
far
im
eager
to
find
some
others
this
is
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
summer
day
chilled
room
temp
doesnt
suit
this
too
well
i
didnt
even
know
that
this
was
an
ab
beer
when
i
ordered
it
in
ct
i
had
never
seen
it
before
but
ab
or
not
i
knew
that
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
mess
the
taste
slams
you
with
its
overpowering
spice
this
beer
is
to
witbier
as
pizza
filled
combos
are
to
real
pizza
it
runs
down
a
check
list
of
elements
to
qualify
it
as
a
witbier
without
any
attention
to
the
quality
of
these
elements
or
how
they
work
together
the
best
thing
about
this
was
the
mouthfeel
because
it
was
light
enough
on
the
palate
to
be
passable
for
most
people
on
hot
summer
nights
i
guess
im
just
turning
into
a
beer
snob
a
bit
but
i
really
didnt
care
for
this
there
are
so
many
other
representations
of
the
style
that
are
so
much
better
my
advice
would
be
to
check
the
others
out
first
if
you
can
d
despite
a
poor
taste
the
mouthfeel
makes
the
beer
rather
drinkable
during
the
summer
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
but
i
was
not
impressed
much
at
all
on
the
lighter
i
can
probably
chug
this
beer
or
play
beer
pong
with
it
so
it
is
not
a
complete
waste
got
this
one

this

i
enjoyed

at

timenot
something
ill
go
out
of
my

for
but
worth
a
try
overall
not
for
relaxing
and
enjoying
but
for
drinking
and
drinking
and
drinking
and
pretty
basic
orange
and
spice
taste
with
w
tiny
bite
on
the
end
not
impressive
and
got
worse
the
further
along
i
got
until
i
finally
gave
up
with
about
a
third
of
it
left
in
my
glass
not
something
ill
have
again
as
it
left
a
lot
to
be

i
have
to
admit
that
i
have
a
predisposition
towards
not
liking
anheuserbusch
products
theyve
just
never
ever
impressed
me
utterly
dissapointing
white
ale
completely
average
appearance
with
dull
uninspiring
aroma
smelled
just
like
budweiser
palate
was
medium
to
full
very
dry
for
a
wheat
beer
with
a
moderate
astringent
feel
flavor
was
very
acidic
with
a
thankfully
short
finish
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
maybe
even
a
hair
better
than
blue
moon
though
id
have
to
compare
them
side
by
side
ill
probably
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
before
the
summers
out
this
beer
has
one
of
the
oddest
eyepopping
taps
around
a
transmogrified
orange
with
sunglasses
and
a
mohawk
for
3
at
a
local
bar
i
took
a
whirl
with
this
one
it
came
with
an
orange
slice
and
while
i
typically
hate
fruit
in
beer
i
decided
to
just
go
with
the
flow
glad
i
did
this
beer
tasted
almost
like
a
sunkist
soda
very
orangey
i
like
sunkist
so
i
liked
this
beer
not
sure
i
could
drink
several
but
it
was
enjoyable
i
was
surprised
when
i
got
home
to
see
that
its
an
anheuserbusch
beer
youd
think
it
would
be
in
more
bars
its
better
than
most
of
that
macrobrewerys
selections
for
sho
simple
but
pleasant
i
actually
like
it
better
than
the
oddly
muchlauded
blue
moon
not
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
cloudy
orange
appearance
was
nice
but
the
smell
and
taste
seemed
way
too
sweet
and
overdone
orangecitrus
taste
was
overbearing
and
artificial
medium
body
somewhat
crisp
feel
way
too
many
superior
witbiers
to
bother
with
this
again
looks
right
with
the
cloudy
yellow
colour
and
the
white
head
the
nose
was
kinda
citrus
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
the
beer
is
really
too
sweet
for
the
style
with
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
i
could
not
really
drink
much
more
than
a
8oz
glass
which
considering
i
love
wits
for
their
drinkability
says
something
the
rest
well
file
under
if
you
dont
have
something
nice
to
say
but
allinall
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
as
a
refresher
on
a
hot
day
like
today
i
could
easily
put
away
a
few
of
these
unless
the
overpowering
orange
sensation
started
to
do
me
in
and
make
me
thirstier
than
i
was
before
d
not
a
bad
summer
beer
decent
offering
from
ab
a
refreshing
summer
brew
for
sure
a
respectable
effort
by
ab
d
decent
drinkability
and
fairly
easy
to
put
these
down
i
enjoyed
the
experience
of
trying
a
new
beer
that
i
had
not
had
before
and
would
not
turn
this
down
if
offered
to
me
obviously
not
the
best
to
style
but
a
decent
effort
at
hitting
the
mark
one
thing
ab
does
do
right
is
the
born
on
date
too
bad
more
brewers
arent
into
the
full
disclosure
every
discerning
beer
drinker
deserves
ironic
that
ab
does
it
because
i
doubt
your
average
bud
light
fan
could
give
a
shit
as
for
shock
top
cool
name
and
label
a
worthwhile
choice
if
youre
faced
with
a
cooler
of
ab
stuff
in
a
pinch
and
not
their
worst
by
a
long
shot
overall
good
example
of
a
classic
belgian
wit
considering
its
from
a
domestic
brewing
giant
abs
direct
competition
to
blue
moon
and
they
arent
discernable
between
eachother
this
is
the
modern
chick
beer
pretty
nondescript
pretty
harmless
not
terrible
but
i
probably
wont
seek
it
out
again
lightly
cloudy
yellow
tan
in
color
it
offers
minor
white
suds
and
similar
lacing
the
aroma
is
polite
mild
lemon
bread
aroma
pleasant
effervescent
light
bodied
bread
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
with
a
faint
orangelemon
note
its
weak
i
would
prefer
a
little
more
body
not
horrible
but
not
complex
at
all
not
rich
just
passable
for
the
style
overall
not
the
best
witbier
but
its
a
nice
switchup
from
ab
im
not
going
to
seek
it
out
but
if
a
taplist
was
limited
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
it
d
a
good
summer
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
thats
it
drinkability
not
bad
i
find
the
beer
more
drinkable
than
most
macro
products
and
i
dont
generally
care
for
witbier
as
far
as
other
big
name
wits
it
really
falls
short
id
rather
have
a
blue
moon
or
even
a
can
of
wittekerke
not
a
bad
try
and
ill
be
able
to
finish
this
one
before
heading
to
bed
shortly
but
tons
of
room
for
improvement
pours
cloudy
and
pale
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aromas
of
pale
malts
and
possibly
rice
syrup
with
very
faint
hints
of
citrus
and
white
wine
familiar
wit
flavor
and
sourness
but
really
only
a
shadow
of
the
greats
hops
are
not
evident
body
is
a
bit
too
weak
and
the
finish
is
not
pleasant
not
a
terrible
beer
but
there
are
far
far
better
wits
out
there
this
is
obviously
anheusers
buschs
response
to
coors
blue
moon
just
not
good
enough
got
this
one
not
realizing
what
it
was
but
ended
up
being
pleasantly
surprised
certainly
not
a
good
beer
by
any
means
but
as
another
reviewer
said
its
definitely
better
than
most
macros
appearance
was
weak
a
light
tooyellow
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
dissolved
quickly
mild
nose
of
citrus
and
wheat
which
followed
through
in
the
flavor
which
was
strong
on
lemons
and
weak
on
most
other
things
again
not
bad
just
not
much
there
body
was
a
little
thin
but
not
too
bad
overall
not
nearly
as
bad
as
it
could
have
been
the
beer
didnt
look
much
different
than
any
other
ab
product
there
was
no
aroma
to
speak
of
the
label
promises
spices
but
there
were
none
discernible
the
rating
says
1awful
its
not
that
the
flavor
was
awful
but
that
there
wasnt
any
the
mouthfeel
was
like
low
carbonated
water
even
though
the
body
is
light
the
drinkability
factor
is
below
average
since
theres
really
nothing
to
keep
me
coming
back
this
is
a
decent
macro
not
a
great
witbier
i
appreciated
the
sample
but
wouldnt
grab
this
in
a
beer
store
notes
this
is
a
light
tasting
beer
made
in
my
opinion
for
easy
drinking
it
does
not
taste
that
good
but
it
sure
goes
down
easy
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
not
bad
for
a
wit
have
had
better
it
had
a
decent
head
immediately
after
pouring
but
this
quickly
disappeared
and
like
everyone
has
noted
there
was
no
lacing
to
speak
of
there
was
very
little
aroma
just
some
slight
citrus
my
first
sip
was
fine
with
orange
being
the
dominant
flavor
while
drinking
though
the
flavor
became
less
and
less
enjoyable
fairly
weak
overall
mouthfeel
was
fine
not
heavy
but
not
too
light
its
drinkability
was
obviously
hurt
by
the
bland
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
not
worth
buying
another
6pack
probably
best
described
as
a
good
choice
for
the
novice
ale
drinker
to
try
and
leave
the
undrinkable
grocery
store
favorites
in
the
cooler
case
pours
out
to
a
cloudy
slightly
milky
pale
gold
forming
a
modest
white
head
which
quickly
recedes
leaving
not
much
lace
at
all
moderate
carbonation
the
aroma
is
fairly
weak
surprisingly
there
is
some
subtle
wheat
cracker
notes
some
macro
twang
ruddy
coriander
and
a
faint
fruitiness
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
a
light
body
the
taste
is
somewhat
weak
too
the
coriander
gives
it
a
ruddy
flavor
on
top
of
the
macro
twang
and
this
barely
lets
the
fruit
peels
have
any
say
id
much
rather
go
without
the
lemon
and
lime
and
just
dump
more
orange
into
it
but
then
it
would
be
called
blue
moon
this
is
pretty
bland
my
gf
likes
belgian
wits
but
she
didnt
care
for
this
at
all
and
i
have
to
agree
this
ones
not
even
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
skip
it
all
in
all
not
a
bad
offering
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
color
which
threw
me
off
since
it
is
a
belgian
white
and
i
would
say
all
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
have
been
hazey
the
carbonation
level
was
fairly
good
the
head
that
was
created
was
pure
white
and
pillowy
not
long
lasting
and
no
lace
the
aroma
was
average
wheat
notes
some
oranges
breads
and
spices
the
taste
pretty
much
reflected
the
aromas
decent
wheat
hints
of
citrus
oranges
and
a
tad
lime
in
and
out
and
finished
with
a
bready
feeling
on
the
back
of
the
swallow
not
much
on
the
mouthful
it
was
the
first
hint
and
reminder
of
who
backs
this
brew
ab
drinkable
well
yes
better
then
her
sisters
of
ab
and
if
it
were
on
tap
and
nothing
else
was
available
i
would
get
again
d
not
too
good
since
it
lacks
flavor
drank
very
easy
a
bit
more
body
complexity
this
would
be
a
nice
wit
still
would
be
fairly
satisfied
not
happy
if
this
was
the
best
beer
available
pours
smooth
decent
head
nice
color
for
an
overfilteredmacrowit
i
assume
they
are
using
real
wheat
and
avoiding
rice
coriander
orange
peel
are
there
but
lends
like
an
added
powder
or
artificial
syrup
md
light
and
bubbly
it
was
not
grainy
nor
heavy
which
made
it
very
good
to
drink
and
something
that
i
would
highly
recommend
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
bay
and
main
in
greenport
only
because
the
server
had
no
clue
when
i
asked
which
brewery
this
beer
came
from
it
is
one
of
the
better
ab
products
although
thats
not
saying
much
what
youll
get
is
a
very
mild
inoffensive
middle
of
the
road
innocuous
belgian
wit
that
wont
offend
but
wont
challenge
anyones
tastes
either
it
certainly
looks
good
it
has
the
orangy
yellow
haze
white
foamy
head
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
slight
and
it
has
the
floral
characteristics
of
the
style
albeit
toned
down
the
taste
is
similar
in
that
youll
get
the
orange
rind
coriander
floral
citrus
perhaps
a
touch
of
pineapple
you
wont
get
much
clove
spice
or
anything
else
that
would
make
this
memorable
it
is
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
also
forgettable
if
you
want
a
great
tasting
belgian
white
brew
shock
top
belgian
white
isnt
the
answer
it
isnt
terrible
but
it
fails
to
impress
and
its
flavor
will
frustrate
most
who
sample
it
there
are
tastier
witbiers
that
cost
less
and
taste
better
i
like
that
the
anheuserbusch
fancy
beers
taste
similar
to
more
expensive
counterparts
i
think
other
belgian
whites
are
better
than
this
beer
but
this
is
good
beer
for
the
money
its
got
a
hazy
and
cloudy
yelloworange
hue
and
not
much
head
it
smells
earthy
and
spiced
like
orange
peels
has
a
decent
taste
i
detect
orange
peel
bitterness
and
a
kind
of
spiced
flavor
maybe
clove
the
label
says
coriander
maybe
thats
what
im
picking
up
on
its
got
a
nice
constistancy
and
texture
and
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
didnt
like
this
much
at
all
i
appreciate
that
ab
is
trying
to
put
out
different
stuff
but
this
seemd
like
it
was
trying
too
hard
to
be
blue
moon
with
the
orange
already
in
it
straw
in
color
not
quite
as
white
as
some
of
the
others
i
have
tried
solid
white
head
follows
the
liquid
down
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
lacing
slight
lemony
smell
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
yeasty
smell
as
well
taste
is
spicy
and
citrusy
just
as
you
would
expect
a
slight
bready
yeast
flavor
in
there
as
well
co2
prickles
with
the
light
body
being
refreshing
not
a
bad
effort
at
all
for
ab
i
got
it
for
6
79
at
food
lion
so
i
guess
that
isnt
a
bad
price
when
compared
to
others
i
would
buy
again
edit
i
did
not
realize
this
was
an
ab
product
not
bad
for
them
beats
the
hell
out
of
natty
this
is
drinkable
but
very
mild
if
you
can
get
by
the
clumps
of
yeast
you
may
find
this
to
be
an
innocent
wheat
beer
mouthfeel
is
very
light
with
a
creamy
body
from
the
carbonation
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
appeared
a
dark
yellow
with
not
head
or
lacing
so
theres
no
complimentary
foam
and
its
too
dark
the
aroma
is
of
dry
spicy
orange
the
flavor
has
that
same
orange
with
bland
belgianlike
spice
corriander
pepper
the
flavor
and
aroma
arent
bad
certainly
not
normal
for
the
style
but
its
an
overall
agreeable
experience
a
real
wit
has
more
delicate
spices
with
vanilla
and
mellow
wheat
the
body
here
is
also
surprisingly
heavy
with
a
sort
of
medium
strength
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chaulky
well
its
better
than
the
vast
majority
of
abs
beers
got
to
try
this
over
the
weekend
out
on
the
river
nice
refreshing
summertime
beer
poured
a
hazycolored
gold
out
of
the
12
oz
bottle
with
a
wispy
thin
head
aroma
was
of
banana
and
cloves
maybe
berry
as
well
the
taste
was
pretty
good
soft
dryness
from
the
wheat
with
a
nice
fruity
ester
taste
nice
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
definitely
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
want
any
more
than
this
sample
mouthfeel
is
actually
nice
and
creamy
with
that
good
wheaty
quality
too
bad
it
tastes
like
an
orange
soda
oh
my
god
what
crap
for
beer
especially
trying
to
pawn
itself
of
as
a
belgium
white
totally
worthless
tasted
terrible
bitter
aftertaste
couldnt
even
finish
dont
waste
your
money
sorry
anhauserbush
just
stick
to
bud
bud
light
and
michelob
overall
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
but
does
not
want
to
quaff
a
full
strength
brew
in
the
middle
of
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
servicable
wit
easy
enough
to
drink
wow
this
is
from
ab
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
from
them
and
as
far
as
hefes
go
this
one
is
interesting
and
enjoyable
id
say
this
is
a
decent
witbier
and
a
honorable
attempt
by
anhueser
busch
at
making
a
seasonal
microbrew
if
you
want
a
wheatbeer
in
this
category
that
is
accessible
at
least
for
me
they
are
and
priced
similarly
to
shock
top
but
with
a
decent
complexity
try
tucher
sam
adams
seasonal
white
ale
or
sweetwaters
hummer
if
you
want
something
more
reminiscent
of
orange
soda
go
for
this
it
was
more
watery
than
most
wheats
ive
had
has
less
prominent
spice
in
it
fairly
sweet
very
little
bitterness
and
definitely
has
orange
flavor
in
it
mouthfeel
way
thin
despite
the
fact
that
it
appears
unfilitered
its
fairly
watery
but
with
plenty
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
smell
is
a
hint
of
spice
and
some
slight
fruitiness
tasted
like
regular
bud
except
unflitered
with
some
spices
tossed
in
and
some
wheat
substituted
thught
it
could
be
drier
but
could
not
get
over
the
bud
taste
was
hoping
a
better
attempt
would
be
made
d
not
bad
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
but
considering
who
makes
it
and
how
easy
it
is
to
find
its
an
ok
choice
a
heatbeater
for
sure
not
bad
but
falls
short
compared
to
others
of
the
style
because
of
its
thinnness
another
boring
summer
brew
from
anheuserbusch
i
expected
disappointment
and
i
got
it
poured
a
very
cloudy
light
gold
color
smelled
faintly
of
orange
and
very
little
malt
tasted
very
thin
with
barely
detectable
citrus
and
hardly
the
complexity
of
a
good
witbier
i
just
tried
this
one
for
the
sake
of
trying
it
12oz
brown
bottle
from
hannaford
sounds
like
last
years
spring
heat
spiced
wheat
same
beer
lets
find
out
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
quickly
dissipating
offwhite
head
smells
faintly
orangeylemony
tastes
like
lemon
with
some
orange
notes
faint
spice
and
vanilla
notes
and
a
very
clean
finish
medium
bodied
with
muted
carbonation
very
drinkable
nothing
off
or
displeasing
about
this
beer
but
fairly
pedestrian
and
bland
as
well
in
a
word
safe
disspointment
never
breaks
hearts
raised
hopes
do
the
appearance
brought
up
my
hopes
but
the
raised
expectations
from
it
broke
my
heart
when
i
tasted
it
this
is
one
witbier
that
might
need
an
orange
slice
to
keep
your
interest
no
glass
on
hand
review
from
bottle
citrus
notes
a
little
overwhelming
on
the
nose
follow
through
to
taste
something
very
artificial
here
as
if
they
brewed
this
stuff
with
powdered
tang
mix
as
a
dryhop
mouth
a
little
watery
for
a
belgian
would
have
liked

more
carbonation
especially
in
the
finish
that
said
i
know
that
this
is
an
ab
effort
and
not
aimed
at
the
ba
but
our
friends
and
neighbors
could
this
bring
more
attention
to
craft
brewing
is
the
real
question
here
does
its
taking
shelf
space
from
other
crafts
or
from
bud
light
do
the
industry
justice
yes
and
no
certainly
more
drinkable
than
a

love
this
beer
very
nice
flavor
perfect
summer
beer
i
think
of
this
as
a
vacation
beer
because
its
always
available
wherever
i
happen
to
travel
this
flavor
is
tied
to
pleasant
nostalgia
for
me
im
not
going
to
lie
but
this
is
orse
well
well
well
again
a
beer
ive
been
looking
forward
to
sampling
started
off
amazing
fruity
followed
by
a
nutty
aftertaste
but
this
became
an
acquired
taste
after
a
few
sips
well
made
beer
with
some
strengths
but
not
one
id
chose
of
hoegaarden
witbier
this
is
my
favorite
beer
and
it
is
great
with
orange
especially
love
this
beer
so
much
the
number
one
beer
of
choice
for
my
inlaws
dark
orange
color
white
head
smell
is
spice
yeast
coriander
slight
citrus
very
subtle
taste
is
clean
smooth
spicy
coriander
subtle
orange
peel
yeasty
lower
side
of
carbonation
almost
creamy
i
like
blue
moon
a
lot
especially
after
a
couple
cheaper
beers
like
pbr
forget
who
makes
it
if
hat
turns
you
away
this
is
a
great
beer
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
in
my
area
instead
of
almost
12
for
a
sixer
and
well
over
30
for
a
case
it
would
be
an
every
day
beer
for
me
very
enjoyable
great
beer
for
a
wheat
beer
for
a
beer
i
can
find
anywhere
and
everywhere
in
the
midwest
pretty
damn
good
o
not
bad
with
a
slice
of
orange
it
would
make
a
pretty
refreshing
summer
brew
a
good
cheap
americanized
witbier
overall
one
of
my
favorites
i
used
to
drink
this
a
lot
before
i
got
into
craft
i
had
it
on
a
whim
for
ole
times
sake
truly
not
bad
for
a
macro
it
is
refreshing
and
i
would
not
turn
it
down
on
a
hot
summer
day
however
its
attempt
at
orange
fruitiness
although
somewhat
tasty
nevertheless
has
too
much
of
an
orange
soda
flavor
to
it
like
i
said
i
would
not
turn
it
down
but
with
all
the
other
great
brews
i
have
yet
to
try
i
will
not
seek
this
one
out
not
much
words
in
this
one
besides
the
fact
that
it
is
simply
great
this
is
a
great
beer
my
favorite
beer
of
all
time
this
beer
is
great
with
an
orange
wedge
best
beer
ever
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
if
you
add
an
orange
to
it
it
makes
it
even
better
a
light
beer
with
some
citrus
flavors
in
it
was
served
to
me
with
an
orange
slice
which
complimented
it
nicely
not
the
greatest
beer
ive
had
but
it
was
an
enjoyable
experience
this
is
the
perfect
beer
for
beginners
who
want
to
get
into
real
beer
a
gateway
beer
if
you
will
my
go
to
beer
nothing
wrong
with
it
cloudy
and
golden
orange
smelling
citrusy
with
light
carbonation
creamy
finish
nice
body
and
carbonation
bitterness
should
be
higher
in
my
opinion
great
wheat
style
beer
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thicker
side
has
typical
cloudy
golden
look
for
the
style
good
balance
between
hops
malt
and
wheat

full
disclosure
i
thought
i
had
this
a
long
time
ago
and
didnt
like
it
so
i
have
always
avoided
it
that
being
said
i
was
wrong
this
is
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
i
dont
actively
dislike
it
the
flavors
are
muted
and
come
across
as
a
sweet
corn
taste
i
thought
there
was
belgian
yeast
or
wheat
flavor
but
i
am
getting
none
of
that
i
owe
blue
moon
and
apology
sorry
there
i
said
it
glass
stein
with
an
orange
slice
crisp
and
golden
swell
of
wheat
and
oranges
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
american
belgians
other
than
shiner
and
flying
dog
buy
a
real
heff
this
has
been
terrible
since
it
was
bought
by
coors
favourite
beer
to
buy
and
safest
option
when
undecided
about
what
to
get
smooth
refreshing
a
beer
you
could
happily
drink
in
any
weather
love
it
on
tap
bottled
just
ok
feel
as
long
as
they
serve
it
with
an
orange
slice
i
can
call
it
healthy
i
think
one
of
the
better
citrus
flavored
beers
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
a
touch
thick
for
my
preference
in
white
ales
good
gateway
beer
o
i
really
like
this
witbier
in
the
summer
always
with
the
orange
slice
keg
of
blue
moon
drank
as
with
most
wheat
beers
the
texture
is
fairly
plain
but
the
flavor
is
light
and
citrus
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
my
revisit
to
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
tried
and
liked
i
was
fully
expecting
the
not
quite
as
good
as
i
remembered
experience
so
many
people
mention
having
upon
making
a
return
visit
to
one
of
their
first
beers
but
ended
up
with
the
exact
opposite
i
have
to
wonder
if
the
people
who
bash
on
this
beer
are
really
just
bashing
on
the
company
that
makes
it
rather
than
any
actual
negative
qualities
of
the
beer
itself
or
maybe
others
in
the
style
are
just
that
much
better
that
people
start
to
mistake
less
good
than
this
other
really
amazing
thing
with
not
good
at
all
as
people
tend
to
do
ill
have
to
try
some
of
the
others
and
see

the

bars
have
at

2
miller

its
always
a

sight
to
see
a

in

blue

a

i
admit
that
the
flavor
is
often
overpowered
by
the
orange
served
with
the
beer
but
the
hints
of
citrus
and
coriander
of
the
beer
itself
are
quite
pleasant
for
a
mass
produced
product
of

the

to

you

it
if
youre
looking

an

then
this
is

its

it

orange
color
hazy
but
not
by
much
its
sad
that
a
beer
requires
an
orange
to
taste
better
the
price
is
crap
on
draught
for
the
quality
anyways
heres
the
score
a

orangish

has
a

not

m
light

mouthfeel
nothing
too
much

watered
down
t
the
taste
is

continued
to
influence
the
beer
when
i
flicked
it
off
the
glass
the
taste
was

i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
beer
but
then
had
to
mix
some
things
up
with
red
beers
makes
a
really
nice
summer
beer
for
some
people
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
blue
moon
has
never
been
a
terrible
beer
in
my
opinion
but
since
its
from
coors
i
do
have
a
bit
of
an
issue
buying
it
if
its
free
ill
drink
it
but
i
really
dont
feel
the
need
to
go
out
and
purchase
these
with
my
own
money
unless
its
all
thats
available

a

the

is
a

the

of

i
soon
realized
that
was
a
big
mistake
the
orange
simply
masked
the
flavor
of
the
beer
and
made
it
way
too
sweet
for
my
palate
next
time
i
have
this
beer

appearance
of
this
beer
is
a
very
cloudy
pale
orange
color
with
a
nice
finger
of
white
foam
the
aroma
is
skewed
a
bit
due
to
the
presence
of
the
orange
in
my
glass
so
i
know
ill
be
swallowing
many
more
gallons
of
this
stuff
in
my
lifetime
and
taste
is
the
perfect
match
for
me
its
got
that
perfect
dark
color
and
this
beer
can
stand
on
its
own
it
is
not
like
corona
where
you
need
some
help
to
make
it

d
i
used
to
really
like
this
beer
about
3
years
ago
but
ive
since
expanded
my
palate
and
this
just
doesnt
cut
it
it
will
do
in
a
pinch
and
people
will
usually
have
this
at
a
party
or
something
like
that
its
easily
drinkable
and
coors
could
do
a
lot
worse
drinkability
im
going
to
call
this
very
drinkable
unlike
a
lot
of
one
and
done
micros
this
is
something
i
could
have
a
few
of
feels
odd
giving
a
macro
such
a
high
score
but
being
light
on
alcohol
and
passable
in
the
flavor
department
apparently
has
its
perks
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
good
for
hot
summer
days
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
tastes
but
i
got
a
case
tonight
and
will
finish
it
by
the
weekend
good
beer
but
nothing
amazing
not
on
par
with
other
wits
ive
had
but
decent
enough
on
a
nice
day
drinkability
this
actually
was
a
nice
beer
especially
since
i
was
outside
cooking
on
the
grill
for
a
coors
product
i
was
impressed
this
beer
suprised
me
upon
seeing
it
was
a
wheat
beer
i
was
expecting
the
kind
of
smell
and
taste
of
a
hefewiezen
but
opening
the
bottle
there
is
a
definate
citrus
smell
that
hits
you
upon
the
first
taste
you
definatly
have
the
fruitycitrusy
taste
that
isnt
involved
with
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
definatly
a
good
beer
available
pretty
much
at
every
store
recomended
for
somone
who
wants
somthing
more
domestic
but
not
the
bland
budwiesercoors
or
miller
taste
somewhat
cloudy
in
appearance
and
more
closer
to
a
hefeweizen
colorwise
than
a
witbier
aroma
has
hints
of
wheat
and
spice
and
even
coriander
taste
is
somewhat
interesting
its
pretty
bitter
and
not
quite
what
i
expect
in
a
witbier
too
much
spice
and
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
just
not
very
impressive
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
to
see
if
the
second
impression
was
as
good
as
the
first
overall
this
is
a
fine
little
blond
lady
id
suggest
it
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
an
american
attempt
at
witbier
this
is
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
season
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
also
like
to
swish
the
bottle
to
make
sure
i
get
all
of
the
goodness
in
my
glass
pretty
good
beer
kind
of
a
poor
mans
hoegaarden
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
decent
head
that
it
doesnt
retain
aroma
is
kind
of
weak
flavor
is
a
bit
citrusy
but
also
tastes
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
good
and
the
amount
of
carbonation
seems
to
be
good
probably
the
best
coorsmolson
beer
ive
had
very
drinkable
pretty
much
available
anywhere
im
pretty
amazed
that
they
pack
12
cases
because
for
a
quality
product
you
dont
usually
see
more
than
6
but
then
again
it
is
coors
brewing
co
attractive
bottle
and
a
cloudy
murky
color
with
nice
head
the
smell
is
big
on
citrus
and
light
on
hops
and
that
will
be
very
apparent
and
reaffirmed
upon
the
first
sip
light
smooth
ale
with
pretty
strong
citrus
hints
light
but
leaves
a
pretty
sticky
taste
in
your
mouth
after
a
while
overall
i
could
easily
drink
these
all
night
compared
to
the
other
widely
available
beers
this
beer
is
the
king
that
said
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
dont
like
the
appearance
or
the
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
is
ok
and
thats
the
most
important
part
a
decent
wheat
beer
taste
with
a
touch
of
lemon
cant
complain
too
much
about
that
d
the
puckering
finish
cuts
into
the
drinkability
as
well
decent
enough
flavor
but
i
think
id
rather
just
drink
lemonade
d
feels
heavy
due
to
the
yeast
content
yet
light
on
the
palate
and
relatively
easy
to
consume
its
all
the
rage
now
in
ohio
and
its
a
good
witbier
despite
its
coors
lineage
but
it
has
that
macro
taste
and
id
prefer
a
hoegaarden
or
hefeweizen
to
get
my
wheat
fix
any
day
great

a
cloudy
copper
color
with

some

from

into

sweet
smelling
with
strong
aromas
of
orange
and
coriander
has
a
very
sweet
citrusy
flavor
to
it
orange
pool
coriander
and
wheat
flavors
stand
out
medium
body
not
difficult
to
drink
at
all
especially
with
the
nice
sweet
flavor
this
beer
has
overall
a
decent
tasting
beer
especially
considering
its
produced
by
coors
definitely
a
good
beer
to
get
your
friends
that
arent
into
the

interested
in
it
the
taste
is

is
this

surprise
its
a
great
beer
especially
in

more

are

than
this

that
faded
down
to
a
permanent
18th
inch
hint
of
citrus
and
vanilla
in
the
nose
but
very
faint
i
wish
there
were
a
little
more
here
the
taste
is
muted
cant
really
pin
it
down
as
it
is
i
dont
know
there
really
isnt
much
taste
its
not
bad
at
all
its
just
doesnt
seem
to
want
to
offend
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
a
little
carbonation
up
front
that
becomes
creamy
very
drinkable
if
you
want
generic
this
beer
seems
to
be
the
american
domestic
of
witbier
but
that
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
first
of
all
this
beer
can
be
found
in
many
different
places
and
definitly
trumps
its
usual
neighbors
of
coors
light
and
bud
light
in
terms
of
being
a
witbier
blue
moon
comes
off
not
as
cloudy
as
others
but
maintains
the
classic
spices
and
orange
peel
aroma
and
flavors
that
make
up
this
style
it
is
somewhat
cloudy
with
a
tint
of
orange
to
it
and
a
crisp
head
this
is
not
the
feel
of
a
traditional
witbier
on
the
tongue
but
it
does
somehow
retain
a
smoothness
despite
it
lacking
in
body
it
tastes
of
spices
and
orange
peels
followed
by
a
malty
finish
some
aspects
of
this
beer
really
speak
typical
domestic
but
for
some
reason
this
actually
works
for
this
beer
since
it
retains
some
aspects
of
a
white
beer
blue
moon
is
worth
a
try
and
has
become
my
saving
beer
in
many
typical
restraunts
lightsmoothrefreshing
a
slight
tangyness
had
this
beer
on
my
draft
system
last
summer
when
over
big
with
a
slice
of
orange
in
it
about
the
only
beer
i
would
add
fruit
toit
really
helps
this
beer
out
i
respect
beers
like
blue
moon
quite
a
bit
because
the
have
lead
many
to
beer
geekdom
not
bad
not
great
pours
a
cloudy
very
light
orange
amber
color
with
a
head
that
holds
a
thin
dusting
over
the
liquid
huge
orange
aroma
combined
with
sweet
honeyed
malts
and
a
bready
note
the
taste
skews
toward
a
creamy
coriander
note
along
with
some
cloying
sweetness
from
the
malt
and
a
just
a
bit
of
orange
fruits
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
full
with
very
little
of
the
citrus
acidity
that
youd
expect
from
the
style
overall
this
beer
is
ok
its
too
sweet
and
some
of
the
spices
are
overpowering
but
its
not
terribly
gross
or
anything
still
its
nothing
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
wits
out
there
overall
this
is
a
fairly
standard
light
witbier
common
and
mass
marketed
its
a
great
intro
to
the
beer
world
but
nothing
too
excellent
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
though
on
an
actual
blue
moon
day
i
would
give
this
beer
another
try
without
a
doubt
after
the
second
sip
i
was
dreading
having
to
finish
the
bottle
much
less
the
other
five
bottles
as
for
coors
making
a
wit
this
could
be
a
lot
worse
in
los
angeles
this
can
sometimes
be
the
best
beer
available
and
almost
always
served
with
a
lemon
wedge
dumb
at
best
its
refreshing
and
a
poor
mans
hoegaarden
at
worst
it
tastes
like
coors
chemically
made
wit
not
great
but
solid
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weitzen
glass
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
large
fourfinger
head
that
quickly
turned
to
lace
nice
clean
smell
of
citrus
that
reminds
me
of
earl
grey
tea
taste
is
the
same
bergamot
orange
herby
astringent
nice
clean
finish
with
only
a
touch
of
the
yeasty
sourness
i
love
in
german
weitzens
overall
a
good
beer
and
probably
the
best
american
wheat
beer
ive
had
these
go
down
super
easy
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
dblech
i
tried
to
give
this
a
chance
i
really
did
this
is
a
terrible
wit
the
other
three
left
over
from
the
six
will
sit
in
my
firdge
until
someone
else
comes
over
this
is
like
watered
down
sunkist
with
a
ateaspoon
of
coriander
put
in
refreshing
and
easy
to
kick
back
it
tastes
okay
and
feels
alright
d
even
though
it
is
not
my
fav
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
i
was
shocked
it
was
a
coors
product
this
is
one
beer
to
have
for
dessert
overall
i
was
rather
impressed
with
this
beer
light
refreshing
and
flavorful
it
would
be
a
perfect
drink
for
a
warm
summer
day
given
this
was
the
most
interesting
of
the
fairly
mundane
selection
offered
up
at
the
time
i
couldnt
complain
too
much
not
i
hate
coors
so
liking
even
one
of
their
offshoots
hurts
me
but
i
have
to
say
this
one
isnt
bad
ive
had
this
one
a
bunch
of
times
but
am
just
now
getting
to
the
review
its
usually
the
best
available
at
most
nonbeer
places
pours
a
fairly
opaque
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
sits
on
there
pretty
nicely
nose
is
mild
some
melon
sweetness
as
well
as
citrus
taste
is
good
more
of
that
fruitiness
and
very
refreshing
nice
amount
of
coriander
as
well
feel
is
medium
body
with
solid
carbonation
overall
a
tasty
beer
thats
a
step
above
the
rest
of
the
crap
at
most
places
this
beer
seems
to
be
everywhere
as
the
other
micro
brew
even
tho
made
by
coors
next
to
sam
adams
at
tgi
fridays
and
stuff
but
it
is
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
and
has
made
me
start
to
love
the
witbier
style
probably
one
of
the
easiest
to
drink
beers
ive
ever
had
amazingly
easy
to
drink
alot
of
these
in
a
row
especially
with
an
orange
altho
i
dont
think
u
really
need
one
a
beer
i
could
drink
over
and
over
but
ive
noticed
its
considerably
better
on
draft
then
in
bottles
brewed
by
molson
canada
appearance
is
a
cloudy
wheat
in
color
with
a
crisp
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
smell
is
light
with
malts
and
citrus
taste
is
citrusy
lemon
crisp
but
thin
with
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
mouthfeel
is
light
with
decent
amount
of
hops
but
the
carbonation
makes
it
hard
to
go
down
and
has
a
dry
finish
mouthfeeldrinkability
although
soft
on
its
entry
into
the
mouth
the
beer
quickly
foams
up
and
spreads
itself
wickedly
into
a
frenzy
the
result
though
acceptable
in
this
case
is
reminiscent
of
a
macro
lager
the
gassy
aftermath
could
use
some
taming
for
a
more
enjoyable
experience
for
a
coors
specialty
style
beer
i
can
see
why
this
has
stood
the
test
of
time
for
so
long
its
quite
tasty
and
specific
while
also
being
widely
available
on
tap
and
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
bit
of
head
that
leaves
no
lace
smell
is
of
bitter
honey
and
a
bit
of
citrus
as
well
maybe
from
the
wheat
taste
is
heavy
on
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
bitter
this
was
so
heavy
carbonated
it
was
hard
for
me
to
drink
it
did
go
down
smooth
after
i
got
a
bit
use
to
it
this
would
be
pretty
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
the
greatest
in
the
world
though
this
was
my
first
experience
with
a
witbier
and
it
has
proven
to
have
been
a
good
place
to
start
this
beer
is
widely
available
because
it
is
brewed
by
coors
of
golden
colorado
this
is
a
very
decent
massproduction
version
of
a
belgian
white
ale
i
must
say
that
although
many
bars
now
serve
this
pint
topped
with
a
citrus
garnish
i
much
prefer
it
without
poured
a
cloudy
orange
colour
and
served
with
an
orange
slice
on
the
rim
this
was
indicative
of
the
flavour
but
added
a
pulpy
texture
to
the
beer
that
was
unusual
the
head
was
slight
and
fast
with
almost
nonexistant
lacing
very
citrusy
both
on
the
nose
and
the
tongue
overall
a
nice
beer
representative
of
the
style
i
was
very
surprised
to
learn
it
was
produced
by
a
coors
company
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
good
for
a
variety
of
light
food
pairings
especially
vegetarian
food
i
too
was
suprised
this
was
a
coors
product
pours
a
hazy
orange
wheaten
the
head
goes
real
fast
the
nose
is
definitly
orange
with
other
citrus
maybe
slight
clove
nice
but
tame
the
same
can
be
said
for
the
taste
very
nice
for
a
bmc
to
put
out
good
flavor
good
price
good
availability
but
there
are
better
domestic
versions
of
the
style
overall
definatly
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
especially
for
being
made
by
coors
d
good
especially
for
a
widely
available
coors
product
that
always
surprises
me
the
smell
is
a
little
unappealing
too
sweet
the
flavor
however
was
surprisingly
complex
with
berries
orange
and
corriander
its
not
dumbed
down
like
youd
expect
in
a
macro
beer
of
any
type
the
body
is
a
touch
thick
for
a
witbeer
but
this
really
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
12
oz
brown
bottle
brewed
by
molsoncoors
in
canada
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
straw
color
with
a
billowy
white
head
that
settles
to
leave
just
a
little
lacing
nice
citrusy
aroma
with
a
little
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
peppery
coriander
tastes
of
yeasty
sweet
malt
with
a
little
orange
and
coriander
smooth
and
balanced
because
this
is
made
by
coors
it
automatically
gets
a
bad
rap
by
some
are
there
better
witbiers
out
there
sure
but
not
a
widely
available
as
this
one
good
call
on
a
hot
summer
day
tried
this
beer
once
before
on
a
suggestion
i
was
told
to
try
it
with
an
orange
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
i
tried
it
after
my
buddy
told
me
that
it
is
better
without
the
orange
it
was
better
without
the
orange
it
is
a
refreshing
beer
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
several
of
these
especially
on
a
nice
hot
day
i
would
order
something
else
before
this
if
there
wasnt
much
of
a
selection
at
the
bar
this
has
been
my
standard
for
introducing
people
to
belgianstyle
witbiers
i
cant
believe
its
made
by
coors
thats
what
i
get
for
not
reading
the
label
closely
anyway
it
makes
sense
since
its
now
on
tap
everywhere
and
it
tastes
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
the
other
macros
out
there
i
think
they
did
a
decent
job
honoring
the
style
and
creating
something
that
most
people
would
enjoy
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
good
beginning
introduction
to
a
belgian
style
white
ale
wit
bier
i
cant
believe
this
product
is
made
by
coors
thanks
to
dad
for
this
tasting
this
is
certainly
not
the
greatest
of
wheat
belgiansytle
white
beers
youll
find
but
an
impressive
attempt
nonetheless
given
its
macronature
you
see
this
thing
on
tap
everywhere
now
even
in
nashville
if
you
order
this
at
a
bar
make
sure
to
ask
for
it
without
the
orange
you
do
not
need
it
as
typical
of
north
americans
blue
moon
suggest
you
garnish
it
with
an
orange
slice
i
avoided
that
temptation
and
does
one
really
need
to
the
flavor
was
complex
enough
to
keep
me
going
maybe
they
want
us
to
flavor
their
beer
so
it
tastes
like
tang
weird
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
light
hazy
straw
forming
a
large
white
head
and
leaving
light
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
light
citrus
along
with
a
medium
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
a
light
citrusy
flavor
followed
by
a
nice
yeast
thickness
and
ending
with
a
light
grain
medium
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
really
suprised
me
i
assumed
that
a
coors
product
couldnt
be
that
great
but
i
was
wrong
its
not
the
best
witbier
but
its
also
not
the
worst
give
it
a
try
left
over
after
a
party
the
other
night
i
figured
i
should
review
this
beer
while
i
have
the
chance
appearance
is
pretty
much
spot
on
cloudy
gold
with
a
nice
frothy
head
the
aroma
is
a
dry
and
almost
vegetal
maybe
some
corriander
or
other
spices
flavor
is
at
first
slightly
sharp
with
a
cough
drop
like
herbal
flavor
some
spices
are
evident
as
well
as
a
light
yeasty
flavor
this
is
definitely
a
good
start
for
the
non
beer
drinker
and
a
great
alternative
to
macrolagers
and
malternatives
for
that
crowd
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
because
of
its
sweetcitrus
flavors
pours
a
very
cloudy
orange
pineapple
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
recedes
quickly
but
clings
a
bit
to
the
glass
really
faint
clean
wheat
nose
with
only
background
spicing
no
real
yeast
character
stands
out
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aromas
no
real
yeast
character
to
speak
of
just
a
wheaty
body
with
orange
and
coriander
in
the
finish
light
bodied
mildly
carbonated
decent
drinker
allaround
but
not
such
a
great
witbier
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
very
filling
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
a
heck
of
a
lot
better
ontap
that
it
is
from
the
bottle
although
i
would
drink
this
over
a
regular
macro
it
definitely
wouldnt
be
something
i
would
go
with
if
i
had
my
mind
set
on
drinking
a
witbier
very
cloudy
golden
orage
color
in
pint
glass
smell
is
severe
orange
taste
is
severe
orange
really
doesnt
taste
like
a
wheat
beer
the
orange
flavor
is
over
the
top
still
more
interesting
than
other
macros
so
if
its
the
best
thing
on
draft
i
will
get
it
sometimes
very
drinkable
doesnt
get
nasty
as
it
warms
up
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
can
be
a
good
introduction
to
unfiltered
beers
or
witbier
or
a
good
choice
if
macros
are
the
only
things
available
d
overall
a
good
ber
one
that
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
i
tried
this
beer
at
a
chain
restaurant
in
a
large
weizen
type
glass
i
was
cloudy
orangegold
in
color
with
decent
head
it
smelled
of
orange
and
citrus
it
was
very
sweet
too
sweet
with
orange
fruit
flavors
it
was
very
gassy
too
much
even
for
the
style
i
would
seek
out
other
white
beers
to
drink
regularly
i
have
been
hearing
a
great
deal
of
this
beer
especially
right
after
hoegarden
is
mentioned
since
i
enjoy
hoeegarden
as
a
session
beer
recently
have
seen
it
everywhere
i
decided
i
would
try
this
beer
call
me
the
ultimate
snob
but
i
was
put
off
when
i
saw
it
was
a
screwcap
it
had
an
umimpressive
head
and
the
taste
was
less
impressive
than
hoegarden
not
a
great
beer
served
chilled
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
actually
had
pretty
good
head
stability
and
left
a
thin
line
of
lace
on
my
glass
smell
was
grainy
but
with
some
yeast
and
spice
there
was
an
aroma
of
citrus
more
orange
than
lemon
and
the
accompanying
orange
slice
helped
rather
than
hindered
the
taste
was
quite
clean
and
refreshing
there
was
a
bit
of
fruit
plus
some
spiciness
in
the
finish
lots
of
carbonation
almost
too
much
gave
it
a
foamy
mouthfeel
rather
than
the
crisp
clean
finish
in
other
wit
beers
a
decent
effort
and
a
good
cross
over
beer
for
someone
new
to
the
style
better
than
expected
blue
moon
looked
promising
in
the
glass
but
looks
are
deceiving
it
lacked
body
even
for
a
witbier
there
are
much
better
wheat
beers
out
there
it
pours
out
a
yellowishorange
color
very
cloudy
and
with
a
thin
foamy
head
often
times
its
served
with
an
orange
slice
to
bring
out
the
flavor
it
mainly
smells
of
hops
and
yeast
but
the
taste
is
more
complex
hops
but
also
some
mild
citrus
flavors
i
always
found
it
refreshing
and
delicious
that
being
saidthis
beer
isnt
a
solid
example
of
a
belgian
white
i
get
annoyed
when
i
am
enjoying
witbier
and
the
bartender
comments
that
it
is
similar
to
blue
moon
it
is
highly
overcarbonated
and
doesnt
have
the
typical
light
taste
of
a
witbier
goes
great
with
the
peelneat
shrimp
from
american
tap
room
poured
into
my
tulip
glass
why
not
with
a
hazy
yellowyorange
like
color
a
respectable
foamy
white
head
lingered
a
bit
adding
to
the
nose
of
course
the
fact
that
it
was
aggressively
swirled
in
a
large
tulip
helped
matters
im
sure
the
nose
had
a
nice
sweet
malty
vanilla
aroma
as
crisp
hoppy
traces
finish
it
off
the
taste
translated
fairly
well
from
the
nose
with
more
pronounced
hops
and
faint
notes
of
wheat
and
orange
zest
i
not
a
user
of
the
orange
slice
by
the
way
but
many
find
it
tasty
the
light
mouth
feel
makes
this
a
terrific
tailgate
or
bbq
beer
pairing
well
with
all
the
grilled
beasts
side
dishes
chips
dips
accoutrements
that
cross
its
7
99
or
so
a
six
pack
path
enjoy
well
here
we
have
a
macro
trying
out
the
belgian
flavors
good
intentions
i
have
to
admit
if
we
could
get
more
people
tuned
belgians
left
would
be
much
nicer
poured
a
very
pale
amber
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
which
hung
around
for
a
couple
minutes
just
long
enough
to
leave
a
little
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
visible
carbonation
inside
made
this
look
lively
and
not
bad
at
all
smell
was
light
but
did
have
some
sublte
fragrences
that
suprised
me
a
bit
of
course
there
was
a
large
amount
of
bread
and
grain
smells
to
get
through
but
once
you
do
there
are
some
hints
at
fruitness
maybe
some
plum
dark
fruits
definate
here
and
some
spice
not
at
all
bad
could
be
stronger
and
the
huge
amount
of
malt
to
get
through
to
find
it
made
it
hard
the
taste
was
very
clean
light
smooth
mouthfeel
and
generous
carbonation
made
it
feel
fine
going
down
taste
was
a
bit
different
hints
of
spices
and
a
tiny
bit
of
fruit
trying
to
fight
against
the
grain
here
low
abv
and
light
feel
made
this
highly
drinkable
overall
this
was
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
but
then
again
not
as
good
as
it
could
have
been
if
they
keep
experimenting
they
may
be
onto
something
i
just
hope
i
dont
see
bud
dipa
not
the
greatest
but
not
the
worst
recommended
but
youll
find
better
examples
of
the
style
before
too
long
d
not
bad
refreshing
even
but
i
wouldnt
have
it
again
drinkability
refreshing
beer
not
bad
at
all
nice
summer
beer
have
had
on
tap
and
in
bottle
many
times
made
by
coors
did
you
know
that
they
should
put
coors
right
over
the
blue
moon
label
lol
overall
a
good
refreshing
beer
to
have
and
a
decent
alternative
to
the
other
macro
brews
this
brew
pours
a
nice
cloudy
yellowish
orange
color
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
although
it
doesnt
last
too
long
aroma
is
of
a
little
fruity
yeast
and
lemon
peel
taste
is
decent
with
a
nice
light
wheat
flavor
and
a
little
more
lemony
citrus
nothing
offensive
just
nothing
strong
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
creamy
almost
and
pleasantly
carbonated
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinker
that
is
available
almost
everywhere
definitley
a
decent
brew
and
a
very
good
crossover
beer
even
if
someone
goes
with
the
citrus
slice
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
am
not
sure
gets
a
fair
shake
because
its
coors
and
there
are
far
worse
options
generally
where
this
beer
is
available
got
a
large
draft
at
ruby
tuesday
was
shocked
slightly
when
the
waitress
brought
the
beer
to
me
not
cloudy
at
all
very
clear
straw
color
almost
looked
like
a
bmc
very
minumal
head
not
much
smell
at
all
or
nothing
that
would
define
a
witbier
the
first
sip
made
me
think
i
was
drinking
a
bmc
but
it
was
smoother
not
much
of
the
typical
orange
or
spice
that
im
used
to
with
the
hoegaarden
which
is
the
only
other
witbier
ive
had
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
one
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
but
its
nothing
spectacular
d
it
went
down
pretty
easy
at
first
this
beer
strikes
me
as
quite
sweet
and
has
a
very
clean
finish
this
may
seem
odd
but
the
smell
kinda
reminds
me
of
cheese
for
whatever
reason
mixed
with
the
smell
of
a
very
sweet
drink
of
some
sort
this
beer
is
different
it
kinda
like
someone
took
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
poured
sweet
tea
into
it
as
odd
as
all
that
may
sound
i
find
it
to
be
quite
good
and
something
i
would
enjoy
to
drink
more
of
very
smooth
and
pretty
damn
tasty
cheers
overall
blue
moon
is
a
great
beer
to
have
around
id
choose
many
other
witbiers
over
it
but
if
its
a
blue
moon
or
bud
light
decision
i
think
youll
know
which
way
im
leaning
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
tartness
dominates
a
bit
as
continue
to
drink
and
really
lacks
the
distinct
flavors
of
a
fine
example
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
pours
a
rich
amber
color
and
the
sediments
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
help
proclaim
that
the
beer
is
unfiltered
the
head
is
pretty
decent
though
going
away
fairly
quickly
and
the
nose
is
that
of
a
great
hefeweizen
the
beer
is
brewed
with
orange
peel
and
you
can
tell
when
drinking
it
no
added
citrus
is
really
needed
but
it
can
be
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
definitely
a
beer
you
will
want
to
hold
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
try
it
with
an
orange
havent
had
this
in
a
while
and
thought
id
try
it
again
pours
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
quickly
reducing
head
faint
smell
of
grass
and
belgian
yeast
its
not
fair
to
compare
to
a
different
style
but
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
hefe
type
body
faint
taste
of
banana
and
clove
with
a
dry
finish
great
for
a
coors
product
just
ok
since
weve
been
able
to
get
good
beer
in
north
carolina
if
you
like
this
style
try
it
but
keep
in
mind
it
is
from
golden
co
so
its
a
macro
in
micro
disguise
cloudy
orange
color
with
an
average
appearing
white
head
fruity
aroma
taste
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
not
terribly
complex
but
aspects
of
citrus
coriander
and
pepper
clean
aftertaste
this
goes
down
extremely
easily
a
nice
choice
when
there
is
nothing
else
but
macros
on
tap
the
head
was
2
inches
high
and
lasted
2
seconds
it
has
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
and
a
fruity
aroma
the
initial
taste
had
the
same
hint
of
fruitiness
that
soon
was
replaced
by
the
taste
of
wheat
although
neither
overpowered
the
other
the
first
few
sips
had
no
aftertaste
whatsoever
but
as
i
kept
drinking
each
sip
had
a
stronger
and
stronger
wheaty
aftertaste
by
the
end
i
wanted
the
citrus
elements
to
come
back
but
i
guess
the
only
way
i
could
get
that
is
to
crack
open
another
one
which
is
just
fine
since
it
was
not
at
all
heavy
overall
its
a
great
wheat
beer
which
works
well
both
in
the
wintertime
or
during
a
warmer
weather
day
which
to
me
is
always
a
plus
not
a
badtasting
beer
and
definitely
will
be
one
of
the
better
tap
offerings
at
a
suburban
chain
restaurant
but
im
never
going
for
one
of
these
if
theres
a
celis
white
an
allagash
or
a
hoegaarden
in
the
room
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
mug
got
a
decent
head
from
a
hard
pour
though
it
doesnt
retain
all
that
well
the
lacing
is
moderate
it
eventually
dissipates
within
510
minutes
orangish
yellow
opaque
color
especially
opaque
only
when
the
yeast
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
is
added
a
lemony
smell
dominates
the
beer
along
with
a
faint
hint
of
wheat
the
taste
is
fairly
good
first
some
mild
hops
then
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
with
the
orange
peel
definitely
dominating
and
then
some
maltyyeasty
sweetness
before
the
orange
peel
and
hops
come
back
again
good
taste
for
a
coors
product
especially
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
nice
carbonation
and
light
bodied
altogether
a
fairly
decent
beer
which
comes
as
a
surprise
since
it
is
a
coors
product
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
into
glass
mug
had
a
cloudy
orange
appearance
with
a
creamy
head
hints
of
orange
and
corriander
were
present
crisp
finish
with
yeasty
undertones
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
super
great
it
is
a
quality
good
beer
though
a
tad
expensive
though
all
in
all
it
was
good
i
recommend
it
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
all
the
time
a
nice
change
from
the
molsonlabbat
d
pretty
good
a
lot
of
people
love
this
beer
and
i
see
why
it
is
mild
and
refreshing
not
a
lot
of
character
but
what
it
does
have
isnt
bad
at
all
also
try
other
beers
actually
from
belgium
so
you
can
see
what
they
are
trying
to
emulate
then
you
may
see
why
i
do
not
like
this
beer
much
i
first
tried
this
several
years
ago
and
i
was
sitting
there
wondering
if
it
were
a
real
belgian
when
john
at
horace
sylvias
told
me
coors
brewed
this
this
is
now
trendy
and
wildy
popular
among
my
macro
loving
friends
that
alone
made
me
more
wary
of
this
brew
it
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
an
enormous
head
that
fizzles
down
to
a
white
ring
the
aromas
are
very
light
but
whats
barely
there
is
typical
of
belgian
wits
light
spice
clove
anise
and
some
citrus
in
here
the
taste
really
isnt
bad
and
i
think
its
drinkabilty
is
fairly
high
but
its
definitely
not
great
when
compared
to
other
witbiers
overall
its
a
decent
offering
but
not
something
i
seek
out
i
do
want
to
try
their
pumpkin
and
winter
ales
which
ive
heard
are
much
better
drinkability
nice
and
easy
to
drink
maybe
a
little
too
strongly
spiced
with
respect
to
most
wits
but
a
good
try
nevertheless
this
beer
is
moderately
drinkable
i
dont
think
three
or
four
would
be
a
problem
but
it
might
get
boring
or
bleh
flavored
i
definately
prefer
it
over
95
of
the
other
beers
on
the
shelf
though
makes
a
great
light
beer
for
the
winter
with
a
semi
high
abv
of
5
4
i
like
the
spice
and
wheat
combination
against
the
tart
wit
yeast
finally
tried
this
beer
that
a
couple
of
my
aquaintances
order
regularly
not
again
unique
cloudy
glowing
hue
maybe
not
unique
im
not
sure
this
is
my
first
witbier
which
begins
promising
does
not
ultimately
deliver
very
sweet
orangejuice
sort
of
flavored
malt
just
a
little
flat
with
a
hardtoputmyfingeronit
taste
i
ultimately
pegged
as
piña
colada
full
mouthfeel
though
still
flat
makes
way
for
a
gentle
rise
of
vapors
at
the
finish
i
would
expect
more
after
downing
a
shot
of
liquor
kind
of
a
blech
finish
to
it
all
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
all
that
much
at
all
a
nice
orange
gold
color
with
a
decent
white
head
with
good
retention
a
malty
bitter
smell
a
malty
taste
with
a
citrus
aftertaste
associated
with
a
witbier
an
ok
mouthfeel
although
i
was
hoping
for
slightly
thicker
pretty
good
drinkable
beer
good
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
sweeter
beer
d
very
drinkable
cheap
easy
to
find
i
picked
up
a
sixer
of
this
at
a
gas
station
on
the
way
to
my
buddys
house
after
work
mellow
and
smooth
many
peoplebartenders
serve
the
beer
with
an
orange
slice
hold
up
your
hand
and
declare
no
fruit
forget
the
fruit
unless
you
are
into
that
kind
of
thing
eeewwyuch
good
beer
does
not
need
fruit
and
such
things
floating
around
in
it
just
a
good
head
in
a
nice
glass
and
some
great
friends
make
this
a
very
good
beer
everytime
i
drink
this
beer
it
tastes
a
little
better
i
originally
scored
this
very
poorly
then
the
next
day
i
gave
it
another
try
and
raised
it
a
notch
now
months
later
its
not
bad
and
ill
even
order
it
occassionally
the
wheat
beers
are
growing
on
me
some
i
got
this
on
tape
at
a
ginos
east
pizza
it
poured
a
cloudy
orange
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
it
had
a
malty
citrus
smell
to
it
and
a
nice
matching
taste
it
wasnt
what
i
expected
from
a
coors
product
or
from
a
wheat
bear
the
bartended
put
a
slice
of
orange
in
it
and
it
augmented
the
citrus
flavor
there
was
good
carbonation
and
was
quite
drinkable
i
might
get
a
6
to
try
with
a
friend
and
i
would
order
it
on
tap
again
pours
a
cloudy
dark
lemon
with
a
substantial
head
minimal
lacing
eighth
inch
head
remains
throughout
smell
is
malt
slightly
grassy
taste
is
not
as
wheaty
as
i
expected
some
fruit
notes
a
tad
hint
of
metallic
notes
and
medicinal
quality
mouthfeel
is
creamy
drinkability
is
ok
metal
and
medicinal
notes
are
distracting
basically
coors
attempt
into
the
craft
world
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
but
it
seems
to
lack
a
little
bit
try
it
but
dont
expect
too
much
i
fiirst
sampled
this
at
the
coors
brewery
in
golden
and
i
continue
to
pick
up
some
from
time
to
time
this
is
a
good
choice
for
a
casual
evening
of
drinking
this
is
just
a
nice
and
simple
beer
its
quite
drinkable
and
doesnt
try
to
do
to
much
a
good
warm
weather
diversion
and
probably
the
best
beer
from
a
macro
brewery
ive
had
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
for
something
made
by
coors
its
even
better
recommended
big
white
foamy
head
that
just
wants
to
stick
around
awhile
looks
a
very
cloudy
golden
color
that
has
lots
of
particles
floating
about
not
much
smell
maybe
a
bit
of
fruit
tastes
thick
and
creamy
with
a
bite
of
orange
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
over
all
with
lite
flavors
this
beer
is
still
on
the
fence
great
tastemild
and
a
bit
uneventful
but
very
clean
and
acceptable
for
a
masspro
witbier
aftertaste
bitter
a
bit
heavy
when
warmer
a
bit
thin
when
very
cold
pumpkin
orange
coriander
taste
good
carbonation
slightly
overdone
nice
frothy
head
that
lasts
about
2minutes
one
of
the
best
macro
produced
beers
that
you
can
buy
the
alcohol
finish
is
almost
vodkaish
kinda
that
warm
mint
with
a
hint
of
lemon
citrus
zest
aftertaste
overall
good
not
great
this
is
a
good
take
on
the
genre
from
coors
theyve
actually
done
a
better
job
with
this
style
than
many
micros
ive
tried
rather
had
a
schneider
hefe
but
i
can
get
this
at
the
local
grocer
for
14
99
a
twelve
and
the
bottle
design
is
very
nice
great
with
a
veggie
pizza
i
can
attest
taste
7
drinkability
5
smell
4
out
of
ten
unfairly
labeled
a
woos
beer
one
of
the
best
sub
8
sixers
at
the
grocery
especially
if
you
dont
count
sam
adams
this
beer
is
often
bashed
unfairly
you
could
do
worse
say
hummer
or
widmer
as
for
adding
orange
again
the
only
beer
that
is
truly
improved
by
fruit
is
corona
and
thats
because
a
corona
is
water
who
doesnt
want
some
lemon
or
lime
in
their
water
i
was
sitting
at
a
decent
but
underfunded
microbrewery
in
cbussince
shut
down
when
the
first
cases
of
this
were
rolled
in
that
seems
like
ages
ago
now
id
say
around
1995
96
the
distributor
was
on
his
last
stop
and
donated
the
last
case
on
his
truckon
his
first
shipment
of
the
prod
to
our
evening
i
found
it
to
be
a
decent
mass
produced
representation
of
the
style
and
still
do
today
id
say
that
today
it
seems
a
bit
more
carbonated
and
thinner
but
then
again
my
palate
isnt
the
same
either
a
very
easy
drinking
witbier
i
particularly
enjoy
this
beer
its
good
for
year
round
consuption
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
appearance
is
an
opaque
murky
yellow
with
active
carbonation
fueling
a
thin
finger
of
fizzy
bright
white
head
that
quickly
fell
back
to
a
light
white
ring
of
lacing
smell
is
yeasty
grain
mostly
wheat
malt
and
spicy
coriander
notes
light
lemony
aromas
also
present
taste
is
also
yeasty
and
spicy
malty
finish
to
a
slightly
dry
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
drinkability
is
excellent
lower
abv
with
a
somewhat
plain
flavor
and
character
is
very
refreshing
this
beer
is
easily
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
coors
company
and
although
gets
a
bit
of
a
bad
reputation
for
being
a
macro
this
beer
still
has
enjoyable
attributes
and
is
readily
affordable
and
available
most
anywhere
not
outstanding
but
still
worth
a
try
nice
introduction
into
witbiers
this
is
an
opaque
banana
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
and
taste
very
solid
but
just
super
average
and
middle
of
the
road
for
wit
im
sure
some
folks
would
gasp
to
hear
this
but
i
kind
of
consider
this
a
benchmark
of
the
style
all
the
elements
are
there
but
subtley
presented
and
very
balanced
its
just
really
nononsense
wit
i
love
hoegaarden
much
as
the
next
guy
but
sometimes
them
flavors
be
wildin
i
poured
this
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
beer
mug
it
is
a
very
hazy
straw
extra
pale
it
has
a
small
head
that
quickly
fades
you
can
both
smell
and
taste
the
wheat
in
the
beer
very
light
with
little
to
no
hoppy
flavor
this
is
a
good
change
of
pace
beer
i
did
not
drink
it
with
the
case
recommended
orange
slice
i
might
next
time
overall
the
drinkability
is
above
average
i
will
have
this
again
but
i
probably
wont
keep
a
lot
on
hand
in
my
fridge
this
beer
poured
a
nice
cloudy
orange
colour
its
lace
lingered
on
the
glass
for
about
2
minutes
it
smells
of
a
distinct
orange
peel
and
various
spices
which
is
a
plus
to
me
its
taste
revealed
a
very
hop
and
malty
side
but
a
nice
orange
spice
tast
as
well
although
to
expsensive
for
me
and
not
being
my
favorite
but
i
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
people
who
like
wheat
ale
a
very
nice
drink
indeed
dvery
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
this
is
the
beer
that
got
me
into
becoming
a
conisuer
really
surprised
to
find
out
it
was
made
by
coors
drinkability
all
i
have
to
say
its
of
course
i
will
have
another
drinking
this
beer
as
cold
as
you
can
get
it
and
on
a
nice
hot
day
will
surely
give
you
satisfaction
not
the
best
of
brews
here
drinks
pretty
easy
doesnt
say
belgium
but
not
bad
better
than
some
higher
browed
efforts
ive
seen
also
mixes
nicely
as
a
black
and
tan
or
black
and
blue
not
bad
i
would
say
this
is
the
new
guinness
in
a
sense
that
the
most
people
now
a
days
make
their
jump
out
of
miller
light
or
bud
with
this
beer
not
sure
if
im
a
fan
of
the
orange
gimmic
a
good
witbier
shouldnt
need
a
piece
of
fruit
i
will
admit
though
that
the
orange
does
increase
the
flavor
of
this
beer
but
what
does
that
say
about
the
beer
then
this
beer
just
kind
of
makes
me
shrug
my
shoulders

from
what
i
have
gathered
this

is
made
by

and
marketed
as
a
microbrew

color
with
a
one
inch
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
sweet
citrus
aroma
and
a
touch
of
coriander
are
present
in
the
smell
definitely
a
dumbed
down
version
of
wit
in
taste
but
nothing
unpleasant
like
a
beginners
version
some
citrus
is
definitely
noticeable
coriander
is
fairly
minor
but
present
not
bad
worth
a
try
and
as
many
have
already
noted
on
this
site
a
good
beginner
beer
to
wean
people
off
macro

a
very

good
for

i
first
had
this
ontap
at
a
flying
saucer
in
my
city
since
then
ive
purchased
several
sixpacks
from
a
local
total
wine
and
more
establishment
i
have
seen
these
sixpacks
even
in
grocery
stores
piggly
wiggly
publix
etc
so
the
coors
guys
have
done
a
very
good
job
in
not
only
making
a
good
belgian
but
also
making
it
available
to
the
common
man
to
those
ends
this
has
become
my
summer
beer
it
is
refreshing
while
at
the
same
time
having
a
bit
of
body
to
it
rather
than
a
quick
and
dirty
common
brew
d
pretty
drinkable
and
refreshing
decent
stab
at
a
belgian
white
notes
from
the
coors
people
this
is
a
great
beer
i
have
heavily
surprised
like
the
bros
said
that
it
is
from
a
microbrewery
such
as
that
milky
light
orange
with
a
small
white
tight
quickly
diminishing
head
the
smell
is
of
mild
wheat
with
moderateheavy
citrus
orange
lemon
and
strawberry
and
some
light
coriander
and
yeast
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
except
its
a
little
more
malty
and
sweet
with
more
coriander
its
not
thin
in
the
mouth
but
it
tastes
a
little
thin
nothing
great
but
very
refreshing
and
fairly
enjoyable
goes
well
with
seafood
appearance
is
cloudy
orange
served
with
an
orange
slice
on
the
rim
of
the
glass
the
beer
is
attractive
to
look
at
the
smell
is
or
orange
and
the
taste
also
is
citrusy
with
not
much
carbonation
this
tastes
almost
like
a
mixed
orange
alcoholic
drink
than
a
beer
but
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
enjoyed
it
more
than
sam
adams
white
ale
another
witbier
mouthfeel
is
very
good
easy
to
drink
a
nice
refreshing
flavor
glad
i
gave
it
a
try
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
a
beer
for
the
summer
and
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
drank
between
4045
degrees
f
it
has
a
slightly
copper
color
and
an
average
size
head
it
really
had
a
citrusy
aroma
i
know
the
orange
had
something
to
do
with
that
being
a
coors
product
i
was
really
impressed
about
how
it
actually
tasted
belgian
the
flavor
has
a
little
kick
to
it
as
well
it
was
relatively
smooth
and
drinkable
i
cant
believe
im
drinking
a
coors
product
and
i
cant
believe
a
coors
product
is
actually
decent
gotta
call
em
as
i
drink
em
and
for
this
one
i
can
only
give
coors
a
thumbs
up
almost
makes
me
want
to
shudder
let
it
be
a
lesson
always
look
to
the
belgians
to
steer
you
right
on
beer
even
coors
did
well
by
doing
so
blue
moon
has
become
less
impressive
to
me
over
repeated
tastings
but
it
has
stiff
competition
from
not
only
its
much
better
belgian
counterparts
but
from
other
u
s
micros
that
are
more
authentic
but
for
what
it
is
its
alright
im
definitely
not
in
the
blue
moon
hater
camp
i
sometimes
forget
about
this
one
i
had
it
numerous
times
and
was
always
slightly
intrigued
but
not
blown
away
only
later
learning
it
was
by
coors
and
is
considered
a
macro
this
gives
it
a
bit
of
an
aura
as
the
better
of
the
worst
sort
of
thing
and
for
that
it
is
admirable
a
good
cheap
backup
but
not
something
youd
seek
out
repeatedly
certainly
worth
a
try
overall
i
was
very
impressed
by
this
offering
from
coors
i
almost
have
trouble
beleiving
that
they
made
this
i
would
definitely
have
another
in
the
event
nothing
better
is
around
a
hazy
canary
yellow
with
a
head
that
quickly
fades
to
fizz
there
were
also
a
few
chunks
of
darker
yellow
yeast
clumps
that
poured
toward
the
end
the
smell
isnt
bad
clearly
wheaty
and
a
hint
of
lemon
tastes
nottoostrong
not
terribly
challenging
with
a
hint
of
lemon
not
the
big
spicy
notes
that
ive
come
to
expect
in
a
wit
very
mild
and
not
bad
but
not
too
exciting
all
in
all
not
that
bad
a
beer
for
something
brewed
by
coors
as
far
as
macros
go
this
one
is
pretty
wonderful
beats
the
pants
of
most
swill
but
i
wouldnt
drop
change
on
these
to
often
and
im
glad
i
got
a
really
good
deal
on
this
sixer
in
my
mind
this
is
a
pretty
average
witbier
i
know
its
sales
are
pretty
good
and
while
it
is
made
by
bmc
i
know
a
lot
of
macro
drinkers
who
favor
it
it
is
pretty
mellow
even
for
a
wit
but
there
is
a
very
slight
spiciness
that
flows
throughout
the
sip
it
is
pretty
sweet
but
far
from
syrupy
or
unpleasant
on
the
whole
it
is
pretty
drinkable
and
not
budgetbreaking
but
there
are
other
witbeers
that
i
would
purchase
before
blue
moon
ill
probably
never
buy
coors
products
myself
choosing
to
support
a
true
micro
or
at
least
a
more
regional
micro
e
g
leinies
point
if
i
am
feeling
cheap
or
the
selection
is
limited
still
i
gotta
give
this
one
its
due
this
is
a
good
session
beer
its
flavorful
but
not
overwhelming
the
orange
added
is
a
very
nice
touch
good
for
a
spring
or
summer
day
or
evening
this
is
drinkable
stuff
although
it
would
have
to
be
a
pretty
weak
selection
for
me
to
choose
this
at
a
bar
or
beer
distributor
very
good
beer
easy
to
drink
and
equally
unique
often
served
with
an
orange
this
adds
a
little
to
the
sweetness
and
also
makes
the
drinking
more
fun
in
a
corny
way
this
beer
is
quite
tasty
and
should
be
explored
if
you
like
sweet
brews
taste
identical
to
sam
adams
white
ale
had
one
at
the
atlas
diner
with
dinner
served
icecold
with
a
thin
slice
of
orange
laid
flat
that
completely
covered
the
surface
of
the
glass
so
much
for
seeing
what
kind
of
head
this
beer
has
the
head
was
a
thin
covering
after
i
removed
the
offending
orange
slice
color
was
hazy
orange
not
much
nose
the
taste
was
very
pleasant
the
sweetness
is
not
overpowering
and
the
fruity
tastes
is
very
mild
the
bitterness
in
the
followup
taste
is
good
gives
the
beer
some
character
drinkability
is
good
i
could
see
myself
having
a
few
on
a
hot
day
or
with
food
i
had
a
st
bernardus
witbier
once
and
this
is
not
the
same
thing
that
being
said
it
is
still
a
big
improvement
on
coors
lite
good
on
ya
coors
you
can
make
a
beer
with
some
actual
flavor
good
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
its
possible
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
in
a
night
drinkability
easy
to
drink
this
beer
pours
a
murky
orange
color
with
little
or
no
head
the
crisp
hoppy
aroma
is
immediately
tantalizing
upon
tasting
i
am
hit
by
a
strong
lemon
flavor
and
im
afraid
little
follows
that
first
rather
overbearing
taste
its
also
a
bit
too
thin
and
watery
i
would
say
overall
that
its
crisp
and
light
and
not
totally
unenjoyable
on
a
warm
day
but
it
could
use
a
lot
more
complexity
and
body
notes
just
too
one
dimensional
not
enough
balance
between
the
citrus
and
the
coriander
as
for
the
appearance
the
head
retention
could
use
some
serious
work
overall
its
the
best
mass
produced
wit
but
dumbed
down
for
the
masses
the
complexity
from
the
yeast
of
a
genuine
wit
and
that
slight
hint
of
acidic
twang
in
the
finish
just
isnt
there
if
you
cant
get
a
hold
of
some
hoegaarden
this
would
work
as
a
substitute
the
plus
side
that
it
is
cheap
one
of
the
best
massproduced
witbiers
in
the
us
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
at
the
same
time
crisp
drinkability
is
pretty
good
overall
impressed
that
this
is
a
coors
product
overall
not
a
bad
brew
for
a
macro
not
very
sharp
tasting
average
for
an
ale
not
bad
and
not
very
expensive
would
go
well
with
food
since
it
would
not
overpower
nothing
really
specatular
about
it
but
overall
pretty
descent
will
probably
try
again
when
the
selections
are
few
avaliable
at
super
market
pours
easy
and
goes
down
easy
not
a
whole
lot
of
substance
widely
available
at
many
bars
and
distributers
makes
it
more
of
a
beer
of
choice
than
it
should
be
at
times
but
never
a
bad
choice
this
is
a
beer
that
is
a
good
introduction
to
craft
beer
for
people
who
have
previously
only
drank
light
american
lagers
it
shows
that
there
is
a
whole
other
world
of
beer
without
assaulting
them
with
bitterness
and
caramelroasty
flavors
smells
and
tastes
fruity
and
citrusy
the
latter
probably
aided
by
the
accompaniment
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
waitress
tried
to
push
a
blue
moon
mixed
with
a
shot
of
citron
pretty
good
for
drinking
several
in
one
night
especially
on
wednesdays
when
its
on
special
at
po
boys
drinkability
usually
not
my
choice
but
i
enjoyed
it
had
one
with
a
roast
beef
potatoes
and
spinach
dinner
worked
very
well
with
food
will
have
another
the
body
is
moderate
a
touch
sweet
for
style
carbonation
is
good
overall
a
bit
fruity
for
style
but
still
good
di
like
it
a
good
standby
when
your
tap
choices
are
limited
i
had
it
with
a
big
plate
of
buffalo
chicken
wings
and
it
complemented
them
nicely
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
straw
with
very
little
head
the
smell
has
some
yeast
and
bakery
like
aromas
with
some
lemon
the
taste
has
a
wheat
lemon
flavor
with
some
citrus
and
coriander
flavors
the
mf
is
lightbut
the
balance
is
weak
with
a
very
watery
aftertaste
not
horrible
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
still
for
coorsthis
isnt
all
bad
drinkability
a
great
summer
brew
why
im
drinking
it
in
the
winter
i
dont
know
and
a
crowdpleaser
at
parties
it
lacks
the
zesty
kick
of
other
wits
i
long
for
a
hitachino
nest
white
ale
but
it
would
still
be
a
great
match
for
sweetandsour
and
mildly
spicy
foods
this
beer
is
incredibly
good
just
short
of
the
belgian
excellence
that
sam
adams
white
ale
has
achieved
but
just
short
my
number
two
beer
for
beers
that
can
purchased
at
the
grocery
store
a
thick
beer
with
exceptional
tastate
d

excellent
session
beer
one
of
my
personal
favorites
with
pizza
and
hot
wings
bars
like
to
put
a
slice
of
orange
on
the
edge
which
helps
bring
out
the
citrus
even
more
just
average
all
around
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
out
of
it
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
good
up
front
flavor
it
quickly
dissipated
however
leaving
me
wanting
for
something
more
than
that
nice
approach
toward
the
end
of
my
glass
i
just
wanted
to
be
done
with
it
the
wheat
taste
was
muted
and
a
bit
weak
so
if
its
a
true
wheat
beer
youre
looking
for
maybe
look
elsewhere
but
the
beer
was
by
no
means
bad
or
offensive
just
lacking
other
than
that
it
was
drinkable
bc
there
was
nothing
else
on
tap
other
than
super
swill
sort
of
a
microimport
wannabees
kind
of
drink
i
think
this
will
be
my
lawnmover
beer
of
choice
this
summer
blue
moon
is
just
one
of
those
beers
that
you
cant
dislike
it
please
men
women
the
young
and
the
old
pours
from
the
tap
with
a
medium
to
thick
head
and
creamy
yellowish
orange
in
color
smells
of
citrus
and
cloves
taste
is
that
of
ripe
orange
on
tap
the
flavor
is
slightly
watered
down
which
is
why
i
rate
it
below
4
5
to
5
as
i
would
the
bottle
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
as
well
dollar
for
the
dollar
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
to
buy
when
you
are
partying
or
you
are
having
a
beer
tasting
session
residual
sugars
are
too
much
update
i
continue
to
like
this
beer
more
and
more
its
become
on
the
easy
drinking
beers
when
i
relax
it
is
really
good
and
very
affordable
i
have
bumped
the
numbers
up
i
still
cant
believe
that
this
is
produced
by
a
macrobrewery
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a
typical
wit
color
it
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
little
bit
of
a
white
head
i
also
noted
some
sediment
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
when
did
this
become
bottle
conditioned
the
aroma
is
a
bit
more
malty
than
i
would
like
the
wheat
is
in
there
but
it
is
not
as
prevalent
as
the
norm
with
this
style
also
the
typical
corriander
and
orange
are
hard
to
pick
out
the
wheat
is
there
in
the
taste
but
as
the
aroma
it
is
too
subdued
too
much
malt
body
to
it
fair
light
and
somewhat
drinkable
if
you
can
get
past
the
somewhatannoying
sweetness
nose
is
almost
nonexistant
i
wonder
if
it
would
be
better
at
room
temperature
taste
and
mouthfeel
are
extremely
light
there
are
none
of
the
traditional
aromas
or
flavors
of
a
witbier
in
fact
there
is
little
flavor
at
all
if
i
didnt
pour
it
myself
id
think
i
was
drinking
one
of
those
ghastly
light
beers
i
was
not
at
all
impressed
imho
save
your
bucks
for
something
with
more
flavor
and
body
very
aromatic
almost
sweet
flower
like
however
a
little
over
carbonated
this
beer
for
me
goes
great
with
fried
appetizers
or
cheese
and
sausage
an
excellent
choice
for
an
americanized
wheat
beer
pours
a
cloudy
orange
yellow
with
bright
white
head
which
has
some
ability
to
stick
to
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
lots
of
carbonation
so
much
so
that
i
noticed
the
yeast
particles
in
this
beer
having
a
hard
time
settling
down
as
they
were
in
a
constant
state
of
cycling
down
midglass
only
to
be
brough
back
up
by
bubbles
has
a
creamy
cheese
taste
to
it
that
i
havent
experienced
in
any
other
beer
one
of
the
first
nonmacro
beers
i
tried
and
it
was
one
influence
in
opening
my
eyes
to
other
styles
of
beer
so
for
that
i
am
greatful
d
i
do
love
this
style
of
beer
this
isnt
the
best
ive
had
in
the
style
but
pretty
darn
good
you
can
usually
find
this
beer
even
in
bars
that
are
budmillercoors
heavy
cause
its
very
popular
therefore
its
usually
kind
of
a
fall
back
beer
for
me
cheers
this
beer
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
i
have
had
it
in
abottle
and
on
tap
if
there
is
a
beer
i
want
with
my
meal
it
is
this
one
it
pours
a
creamy
yellow
color
and
a
nice
smaller
white
head
some
places
serve
it
with
an
orange
on
the
glass
i
prefer
to
throw
that
to
the
side
right
away
the
taste
is
so
smooth
fills
the
mouth
with
flavour
but
not
to
much
this
is
why
it
is
good
with
food
it
will
not
overwhelm
your
food
this
beer
is
common
from
what
i
have
seen
so
if
you
havent
had
it
do
so
this
has
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
like
the
guy
whose
review
is
just
below
me
coors
briefly
had
me
thinking
this
stuff
came
from
a
microbrewer
and
let
me
say
im
also
impressed
coors
was
able
to
make
this
this
was
my
introduction
to
belgian
whites
and
its
quickly
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
the
color
is
a
sort
of
light
gold
but
on
the
cloudy
side
the
head
pretty
tall
and
better
formed
than
i
would
have
expected
in
such
a
fizzy
beer
the
smell
is
very
pleasant
with
some
citrus
and
a
little
bit
of
spice
besides
taste
is
pleasant
and
refreshing
its
light
with
some
sweetness
and
some
sourness
that
adds
pleasant
depth
rather
than
a
perception
cheap
hops
plus
theres
a
bit
of
spice
in
there
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
fairly
light
though
not
at
all
watery
drinkability
is
pretty
good
because
this
is
a
light
and
very
pleasant
beer
but
not
great
because
of
the
acidity
hop
presence
is
rather
slight
since
a
lot
of
the
flavor
comes
from
spice
and
other
flavorings
id
definately
reccomend
this
although
i
have
to
admit
hackerschorr
weiss
was
definately
better
still
it
was
a
surprisingly
decent
introduction
to
a
new
category
for
me
and
if
i
couldnt
find
or
didnt
want
to
pay
for
a
bottle
of
that
hackerschorr
weiss
then
this
would
be
my
choice
for
someone
whos
new
to
beer
or
who
says
they
dont
like
beer
it
has
good
carbonation
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
and
overall
im
pretty
impressed
coors
came
up
with
this
i
dont
think
i
would
have
ever
tried
it
if
they
didnt
trick
me
into
thinking
blue
moon
brewing
company
was
some
kind
of
microbrewery
very
high
drinkability
i
could
have
several
without
getting
sick
of
it
drinkability
very
nice
average
wheat
beer
not
a
great
head
but
nice
inital
aroma
has
a
clean
finish
and
has
a
lot
of
orange
and
a
slight
oily
feel
to
the
taste
would
be
good
if
nothing
else
is
on
tap
also
distributed
by
coors
which
can
be
deceptive
as
its
not
on
the
box
hate
big
brewers
hiding
their
labels
the
body
was
alright
and
it
was
actually
refreshing
not
something
that
i
would
really
buy
in
the
winter
but
if
it
were
summer
time
and
not
much
else
was
on
tap
i
could
grab
one
or
three
and
be
happy
not
a
bad
for
a
beer
coming
from
coors
this
is
a
great
choice
if
they
do
not
have
any
micro
beers
on
tap
it
has
more
flavors
then
other
macro
lagers
that
many
chain
restaurants
offer
taste
is
similar
spice
malt
fruit
grapefruit
banana
nicely
balanced
though
not
terribly
complex
way
above
average
for
a
megabrew
a
touch
rough
around
the
edges
mediumbodied
a
solid
beer
but
not
a
great
one
considering
the
source
a
good
effort
and
one
i
purchased
regularly
when
it
was
available
locally
in
bottles
i
know
most
of
you
belgian
fans
dig
your
chimay
blue
but
as
for
as
blue
moon
and
the
wibiers
go
best
type
of
beer
to
form
out
of
mainstream
wheat
d
nothing
great
but
nothing
offensive
doesnt
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
like
crazy
but
is
one
that
you
can
drink
as
a
session
brew
i
get
why
my
one
friend
whos
basically
a
light
beer
only
drinker
likes
this
stuff
as
well
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
nothing
complex
but
a
clean
taste
that
goes
down
easy
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoy
this
quite
often
it
pours
well
with
just
little
head
it
didnt
really
lace
the
glass
at
all
it
is
a
golden
orange
color
and
smells
somewhat
like
oranges
i
guess
thats
why
they
sometimes
put
an
orange
on
the
glass
at
bars
the
carbonation
is
nice
not
to
powerful
very
drinkable
but
it
is
somewhat
filling
i
could
only
drink
a
6
pack
or
so
before
getting
full
its
made
by
coors
but
is
a
much
better
macro
than
most
i
reccomend
this
beer
to
someone
looking
for
a
good
macro
with
a
pretty
good
rep
overall
good
pours
out
with
a
white
fine
bubble
head
that
dissipates
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
interesting
orange
color
smells
mostly
of
bergamot
orange
peel
on
tasting
it
i
can
tell
they
found
the
orange
peel
coriander
but
they
do
almost
all
the
work
in
the
flavor
profile
here
a
little
bread
wheat
flavor
but
not
as
richly
as
i
like
drinks
easy
and
quickly
one
of
the
better
macros
a
nice
party
beer
but
not
too
complex
refined
the
mouthfeel
is
is
decent
a
bit
foamy
drinkablility
is
good
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
for
the
price
there
are
better
options
drinkability

very
easy
to
drink
tastes
like
an
exotic
macro
potentially
a
good
introduction
to
the
style
because
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
and
not
very
complex
no
clue
it
was
from
coors
until
i
came
to
post
the
review
pours
a
very
cloudy
golden
orange
one
finger
of
fine
bubbles
shows
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
patchy
lacing
orange
peel
and
yeast
dominate
the
nose
with
some
floral
hop
notes
in
the
background
the
orange
flavor
rushes
out
upfront
with
a
nice
yeast
bite
and
citrusy
hops
in
the
aftertaste
that
balance
the
swettness
high
carbonation
and
a
light
body
leave
a
mildy
dry
finish
and
a
marvelous
mouthfeel
a
little
shy
on
the
wheat
flavor
and
perhaps
overkill
with
the
citrus
but
makes
an
excellent
session
ale
for
any
season
12
oz
with
feb
05
on
the
bottle
another
old
one
from
mikes
mart
pours
a
cloudy
piss
gold
color
that
is
too
yellow
for
a
witbier
and
a
1
finger
white
head
that
leaves
some
trails
of
lace
smells
of
coriander
orange
peel
bready
yeast
and
maybe
some
metal
light
body
with
high
carbonation
and
a
lot
of
orange
peel
along
with
coriander
yeast
toasty
malts
sweet
wheat
fruit
and
some
mustiness
actually
pretty
good
for
a
macro
past
the
freshness
date
and
better
than
most
other
macro
offerings
will
drink
again
but
probably
wont
go
and
buy
some
for
myself
not
terrible
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
just
not
paying
for
it
i
suggest
that
you
try
it
first
with
nothing
then
with
a
slice
of
orange
or
lemon
i
know
i
know
scores
of
people
think
that
it
is
a
sin
to
put
fruit
in
beer
but
hey
ya
never
know
try
it
the
makers
of
this
brew
were
able
to
pack
a
lot
of
flavor
in
there
too
bad
in
my
opinion
it
was
all
way
too
much
orange
and
not
enough
complexity
smell
was
very
much
of
citrus
like
orange
scents
taste
is
citrus
as
well
mostly
orange
in
flavor
some
spice
in
there
as
well
not
as
much
as
id
like
to
see
but
it
was
good
none
the
less
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
balance
a
well
put
together
afforadable
beer
drinkability
yes
hazy
golden
color
aroma
taste
are
all
subtle
but
has
soft
citrus
mild
spicy
qualities
bready
malt
qualities
and
not
a
ton
of
hop
character
but
still
tastes
good
a
solid
fallback
beer
as
its
made
by
one
of
the
big
3
quite
drinkable
and
something
you
can
get
at
many
bars
when
they
only
offer
bmc
blue
moon
is
a
very
affordable
and
readily
available
wheat
beer
which
i
find
to
be
a
rare
combination
in
the
glass
it
fades
from
the
side
to
bright
gold
to
a
murky
orange
in
the
middle
its
a
nice
effect
in
a
pint
glass
smells
like
bubblegum
and
oranges
with
a
little
wheat
the
taste
has
a
little
currant
and
citrus
in
it
but
theres
some
sour
corn
there
as
well
the
body
is
thin
but
with
a
complimentary
creaminess
with
the
carbonation
you
get
an
all
right
taste
for
an
all
right
price
here
for
what
it
is
available
cheap
and
decent
tasting
i
love
it
have
it
with
a
slice
of
orange
and
you
cant
go
wrong
your
friends
will
be
intrigued
that
you
are
drinking
it
and
you
will
be
glad
that
you
found
a
decent
tasting
beer
among
the
bcm
at
the
local
bar
drinkability

this
is
a
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
that
is
overly
criticized
by
beer
snobs
but
enjoyed
by
those
drinking
and
not
overthinking
their
beers
i
find
that
blue
moon
belgian
white
is
a
crisp
clean
example
of
style
lacking
only
in
the
subtle
rustic
neuonces
of
a
true
belgian
witbier
crisp
and
clean
finish
this
would
be
great
for
a
tailgating
party
on
hot
summer
days
i
think
most
people
would
find
this
a
good
medium
for
beer
geeks
and
macro
geeks
the
head
on
this
beer
is
decent
not
too
much
not
too
little
this
beers
cloudy
appearance
that
gives
this
beer
character
but
can
be
intimidating
the
the
drinker
until
he
puts
it
up
to
his
face
the
first
thing
that
gets
the
drinker
is
the
smell
it
is
unique
and
you
can
somewhat
smell
the
orange
peel
dont
let
the
weak
smell
fool
you
though
this
beer
has
a
powerful
and
very
smooth
and
flavorful
taste
that
goes
down
solid
and
lets
you
remember
how
good
it
really
is
the
drinkabilty
is
good
and
from
what
i
hear
a
slice
of
orange
makes
this
beer
unforgetable
give
it
shot
you
wont
regret
it
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
very
interesting
at
first
i
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
the
taste
after
thinking
about
it
for
a
while
i
discovered
that
this
beer
reminded
me
of
fruit
loops
to
me
that
is
exactly
what
it
tastes
like
the
carbonation
in
this
beer
is
just
about
right
not
overwhelming
but
not
flat
either
it
goes
down
smoothly
and
is
easy
to
drink
as
to
drinkability
i
like
the
stuff
but
i
dont
think
that
i
could
drink
too
much
of
it
after
a
while
the
taste
of
fruit
loops
would
just
be
too
much
very
drinkable
as
it
is
safe
enough
to
appeal
to
the
masses
i
wont
mind
drinking
these
in
the
future
although
it
will
likely
be
a
last
resort
beer
when
there
is
nothing
better
to
hvae
it
wont
satisfy
a
craving
for
belgian0style
beer
either
this
is
a
strange
sort
of
beer
as
it
is
billed
as
a
belgian
wit
but
tastes
nothing
like
one
the
yeast
is
definitely
not
noticeable
so
it
cant
be
the
traditional
belgian
trappist
yeast
that
is
used
in
other
belgian
wits
like
hoegaarden
and
soforth
i
think
the
only
way
blue
moon
can
be
considered
belgian
is
in
the
spicing
which
is
quite
good
i
really
dont
like
the
funky
tasting
trappist
yeast
anyway
so
this
beer
really
caters
to
my
unique
tastes
the
color
is
an
attractive
orange
that
is
very
cloudy
due
to
the
wheat
and
excess
yeast
i
have
actually
had
a
craving
for
this
brew
upon
holding
it
up
to
the
light
and
seeing
the
baeutiful
way
it
glows
it
may
be
important
to
note
that
this
beer
does
not
go
well
with
pizza
this
tastes
pretty
citrusy
and
fairly
smooth
it
isnt
strong
in
the
spice
area
at
all
but
does
retain
some
wheat
essence
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
surprisingly
good
especially
on
a
warm
day
opinion
i
am
surprised
that
this
came
out
of
the
facility
of
a
macro
brew
there
is
actually
some
flavor
in
this
one
it
is
light
and
a
bit
too
one
dimensional
for
my
taste
but
it
could
easily
be
a
crowd
pleaser
its
not
one
i
would
seek
out
but
i
would
sure
as
hell
take
it
over
anything
else
i
have
tried
from
coors
so
far
i
really
enjoyed
this
the
first
time
i
had
it
dc9
but
with
several
additional
tastings
under
my
belt
i
can
firmly
say
my
first
impression
was
a
bad
one
it
pours
a
cloudy
offwhite
color
with
minimal
head
slight
buttery
smell
seems
interesting
thats
what
must
have
caught
my
attention
the
first
few
times
the
taste
is
rather
unfinished
thats
the
best
i
can
describe
it
it
seems
as
if
the
beer
hasnt
aged
properly
or
was
stored
incorrectly
a
rather
bland
taste
altogether
with
just
subtle
flavors
but
not
enjoyable
really
after
a
sip
or
two
my
mouth
was
exhausted
its
one
of
the
few
not
so
mass
produced
beers
at
dc9
even
though
its
owned
by
coors
so
ill
probably
have
this
again
if
i
go
there
unless
they
get
some
beers
ontap
its
worth
a
taste
now
and
again
but
not
too
often
not
an
awful
beer
but
not
something
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
again
it
did
match
very
well
with
a
sweet
ginger
chicken
dish
we
had
for
supper
tonight
i
had
tried
blue
moon
on
tap
and
finally
found
it
in
the
bottle
happily
i
can
report
that
the
bottled
version
this
aboveaverage
wheat
beer
it
is
virtually
identical
pours
a
dusky
translucent
gold
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
which
unfortunately
fades
fairly
quickly
to
nothing
citrusgrapefruit
nose
typical
of
most
witbiers
ive
sampled
the
first
thing
that
strikes
you
upon
drinking
is
the
almost
annoyingly
bubbly
mouth
however
that
quickly
fades
to
solid
witbier
flavor
predominantly
citrus
i
call
it
grapefruit
and
wheat
so
sweet
as
to
be
almost
cloying
drinkability
is
good
though
perhaps
too
bubbly

bitter
finish
overall
this
is
a
decent
wheat
beer
id
say
slightly
above
average
yes
this
beer
is
made
by
coors
but
dont
let
that
stop
you
from
trying
it
drinkability
is
limited
subject
i
only
drank
the
two
because
of
my
previous
comment
in
my
opinion
half
of
this
one
would
have
been
enough
if
someone
handed
me
a
blue
moon
id
drink
it
if
there
were
other
choices
of
this
style
and
i
was
in
the
mood
i
wouldnt
purchase
it

to
believe
ive
never
reviewed
it
as
this
is

my
go
to
beer
when
presented
with
the
standard
bmc
lineup
that
so
many
sports
bars
orange
peel
sweet
malts
and
an
ongoing
grainy
presence
zesty
hops
with
some
yeastylightly
peppered
tastings
imagine
that

a
decent
offering
well
balanced
between
the
weat
malts
and
citrus
hops
not
sure
if
the
orange
aroma
was
from
the
beer
or
the
slice
very
nice
texture

could
drink
these
all
night

and
people
seem
to
like
it

of
it
as
a

nicely
done

have
to
give

credit
theyve
made
a

here
if

wanted
a

white
uniquely
but
has
the

to
it

wheat
scents
the
taste
is
also
a

this
doesnt
follow

i
cant
figure
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
a

thing
pours
into

does

i
added
a

this
helped
bring
out
the

so
the

to

on

at

serve

i
also

a

with
a

head
that
is
rather
pleasant

its

is

it
is
not

this
brew
pours
out
a
nice

color
with
a
nice
white

this
brew
has
the
look
of
most
witbier
on
the
market
the
smell
is
rich
with
citrus
grains
and
malts
you
kind
of
pick
up
on
a
sour
sweetness

of
this

the
taste
is
bold

flavor
there
is

would
drink

not
sure
if
i
would
seek
out
and
purchase
again
thouugh
unpopular
opinion
here
but
undrinkable
for
me
super
drinkable
good
example
of
the
style
i
had
the
draught
really
enjoyed
ty
he
flavor
and
texture
with
food
all
around
good
beer
not
the
best
wit
ive
had
but
not
far
off
good
wit
bit
high
on
the
body
for
a
wit
beer
taste
is
subjective
i
should
have
read
the
label
more
carefully
i
hate
coriander
this
beer
might
be
someone
elses
favorite
the
spice
flavor
makes
this
taste
bad
to
me
i
bought
a
six
pack
and
took
it
back
to
the
store
to
be
fair
i
will
have
to
try
a
beer
from
them
that
is
more
suitable
from
my
taste
preference
ill
try
avery
brewing
co
ipa
or
stout
next
this
stuff
i
wouldnt
ever
buy
again
i
actually
think
this
is
a
great
beer
to
bring
to
a
party
either
winter
or
summer
since
its
in
cans
and
seems
to
be
conservative
enough
for
those
not
necessarily
into
beer
and
good
enough
for
the
beerobsessed
yummy
not
too
heavy
or
hoppy
in
short
an
enjoyable
beer
o

is
an

odd

slight

it

beer
easy
to
drink
goes
down
smooth
and
can
drink
multiple
ones
in
a
single
setting
o
not
an
overdone
overblown
reach
but
a
more
subtle
approach
to
the
style
what
hop
presence
is
there
does
not
overpower
and
command
everything
for
me
the
way
many
more
hopprevalent
beers
do
japprouve
an
above
average
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pours
a
slightly

color
active
looking

no

however
there
are
some
splotches

refreshing

a

a
delightful
beer
which
i
enjoyed
like
blue

but
bored
with
it
this
is
blue
moon
with
a
boost
more
flavorful
more
orange
and
coriander
definitely
a
solid
beer
choice
if
you
are
a
fan
of
blue
moon
nice
beer
just
a
nice
smooth
wheat
white
beer
heavy
handed
on
the
spice
and
cloudy
as
hell
just
the
way
beer
should
be
not
my
favorite
style
its
easy
to
drink
but
not
complex
enough
for
me
your
basic
whitewheat
ale
has
an
average
witbier
taste
with
a
dull
tone
of
orange
it
s
an
easy
to
drink
social
gathering
kind
of
beer
to
me
i
would
buy
it
again
just
below
average
the
flavours
arent
fresh
enough
tastes
like
diluted
bavarian
weissbier
and
not
like
the
stingy
witbiers
of
belgiumfrance
rating
c
yes
a
witbier
that
i
actually
liked
i
had
this
on
tap
and
didnt
really
know
much
about
it
beforehand
then
came
to
find
out
that
its
a
belgian
white
which
made
me
feel
better
because
i
just
dont
go
for
straight
wheats
this
style
works
better
for
me
and
id
actually
drink
this
one
again

easy
to
put

first
thing
i
got
was

little
spice
on
the
sides
and
a
hint
of
salt

pour
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades

and

strong

full
of

spice

a
little
clove

bodied

with
a

specifically
tangerine
lemon
peal
lacks
body
yet
makes
up
in
the

end
impressive
beer
for
the
style
i
think
it
represents
it
well
pours
a
lemony
straw
color
lingering
white
head
aromas
of
peach
and
wheat
dominate
initially
fading
to
bubblegum
esters
light
banana
and
a
hint
of
coriander
clove
surfaces
late
flavor
is
less
intense
with
a
lightly
bready
crackery
backbone
supporting
pear
and
peach
undertonesa
bit
of
coriander
and
clove
into
a
slightly
earthy
dry
finish
lacks
a
bit
in
mouthfeel
and
wheat
character
but
a
fairly
characterful
example
of
the
style
taste
a
very
popular
beer
and
good
in
terms
of
style
adaptation
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
had
a
bright
yellow
slightly
orangish
color
the
head
is
fluffy
and
white
foam
i
could
smell
some
sweetness
and
mild
spice
and
strong
clover
as
well
i
could
notice
some
faint
citrus
it
has
a
sweetness
taste
to
it
it
also
has
a
light
body
to
it
as
well
overall
a
reasonably
tasty
beer
and
i
will
say
that
the
fact
that
it
comes
in
cans
gives
it
a
head
start
on
the
usual
suspects
i
reach
for
when
i
want
a
wit
definitely
a
great
beer
to
take
out
on
the
lake
and
truth
be
told
this
is
probably
one
of
my
preferred
offerings
from
averyat
least
out
of
their
regular
lineup
a
balanced
belgian
the
color
looks
to
me
to
be
a
slightly
tannishorange
the
head
is
close
to
white
and
definitely
shows
you
that
it
is
there
flavor
is
ok
with
a
little
bit
of
spice
overtones
and
a
bit
of
sweetnessnot
too
much
though
it
brings
a
great
refreshing
flavor
yet
is
light
but
not
too
light
light
golden
colored
with
plenty
of
haziness
head
is
minuscule
and
only
covers
about
a
third
of
the
top
of
the
beer
aroma
of
orange
peelsome
corianderand
pale
wheat
is
present
the
coriander
is
more
prevalent
in
the
flavor
with
orange
peel
and
pale
wheat
playing
more
of
a
background
note
the
mouth
is
a
bit
watery
and
fairly
quaffable
poured
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
15
finger
of
offwhite

it
looks
rather
nice
in

though
it

do
with
a
larger
fluffier
head

of

clove
hints
of
coriander
earthy
belgian
yeast
grainy
wheat
bread
malt
and
hints
of
orange
peel
with
slight
plasticlike
notes
a
standard
though
overall
pleasant
witbier
aroma
that
is
true
to
style
taste
begins
sweet
with
a
nice

flavor

in
the
background
a
faint
tartness
is
also
present
in
the
middle
the
honeylike
flavors
continue
but
the
coriander
becomes
more
assertive
along
with
hints
of
white
pepper
the
finish
is
semidry
with
the
flavors
of
coriander
reaching
their
peak
alongside
some
floral
honey
and
white
pepper
notes
aftertaste
is
semidry
with
notes
of
coriander
white
pepper
orange
peel
and
hints
of
bready
malt
a
very
nice
true
to
style
witbier
flavor
profile
that
is
pleasantly
sweet
refreshing
spicy
yet
not
overpowering
and
a
present
though
not
overbearing
presence
of
orange
peel
quite
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
a
slight
acidity
and
a
semidrying
and
vaguely
creamy
and
smooth
feel
very
nice
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
an
excellent
witbier
it
stays
true
to
style
and
provides
a
wonderfully
refreshing
drinking
experience
while
not
the
single
best
example
of
the
style
it
is
quite
well
executed
and
well
worth
trying
really
nice
witbier
one
ive
put
off
for
drinking
in
a
long
time
but
good
to
know
about
since
i
really
seem
to
be
enjoying
this
one
overall
damn
what
a
nice

brew
yup
sure
would
love
to
have
this

just
wasnt

retained

and
left
a
touch
of
lacing
behind
the
nose
has
the
classic
belgian
yeast
notes
expected
in
this
style
there
is
some
citrus
flavor
present
but
overall
the
taste
is
pretty
mild
its
a
witbier
nothing
to
get
excited
about
o
a
decent
witbeir
nothing
exciting
body
was
a
bit
lacking
decent
american
example
of
the
style
white
rascal
is
a
beer
with
personality
no
doubt
but
its
so
inyourface
that
im
a
bit
overwhelmed
o
im
particularly
into
belgian
strong
ales
so
i
might
be
a
bit
biased
but
id
say
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
though
it
is
certainly
of
the
belgian
strong
ale
style
its
not
as
heavy
as
most
the
prickliness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
but
the
flavors
are
both
interesting
and
wellbalanced
enjoy
d
this
is
a
nice
offering
from
avery
with
very
little
flaws
noted
not
exactly
a
wow
you
beer
but
most
wits
arent
well
crafted
none
the
less
light
and
crisp
with
some
citrusy
spice
o
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
white
rascal
sure
its
an
average
american
mad
wheat
beer
but
with
some
many
very
good
wheat
styles
out
there
in
the
same
price
range
itll
be
hard
to
pick
up
again
i
love
funky
yeast
but
this
was
just
downright
weird
without
those
notes
this
easily
scores
a
3
8
im
sure
ill
cross
paths
with
this
one
again
and
maybe
the
rascal
changes
my
mind
if
light
bodied
american
made
wheat
brews
are
your
thing
by
all
means
try
it
its
worth
a
review
but
if
you
are
looking
for
that
typical
avery
awesomeness
white
rascal
falls
well
short
got
this
one
in
a
can
and
i
liked
the
way
it
poured
cooled
more
quickly
than
a
bottle
and
was
10
cents
cheaper
than
its
bottle
counterpart
o
very
well
balanced
nice
wheat
background
with
no
one
aroma
or
flavor
overpowering
this
beer
mouth
perfect
balance
of
crisp
and
sweet
medium
carbonation
and
wheat
make
for
a
sublimely
smooth
beer
from
my
tasting
notes
belgian
wheat
beers
are
not
usually
high
on
my
list
but
on
this
occasion
the
white
rascal
really
hit
the
spot
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
the
distinct
belgian
yeast
aroma
of
bananas
and
bubble
gum
for
being
a
lighter
looking
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
quite
full
and
chewy
and
the
taste
was
full
and
complex
there
were
hints
of
clove
banana
and
yeast
with
a
bit
of
orange
as
well
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
this
beer
that
i
found
really
enjoyable
and
refreshing
while
i
dont
always
want
a
belgian
wheat
when
i
do
i
will
definitely
look
for
the
white
rascal
the
verdict
good
beer
this
is
what
blue
moon
wants
to
be
when
it
grows
up
a
belgian
white
ale
with
citrus
and
spices
overall
just
kind
of
weak
all
around
nothing
significant
or
good
about
it
i
liked
that
peppery
taste
but
it
seem
a
little
heavy
on
the
lemon
for
me
o
perhaps
a
bit
cool
outside
to
be
drinking
one
of
these
but
i
like
it
will
grab
more
next
summer
for
sure
perhaps
this
beer
is
flawed
ill
try
it
again
later
the
date
on
the
bottle
reads
13186
suggesting
bottling
was
around
july
yeah
its
gotta
be
a
fluke
a
decidedly
pleasant
witbier
bolstered
by
a
certain
american
sensibility
everything
is
in
the
proper
belgian
order
but
propped
up
somehow
totally
worthy
of
another
or
further
session
exploration
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
but
it
fits
this
beer
quite
well
throughout
theres
a
tone
of
orange
and
white
pepper
than
comes
and
goes
nice
dry
finish
with
a
slight
touch
of
wet
biscuit
dough
could
pair
well
with
salads
and
lighter
meats
grilled
of
course
o
good
for
the
style
great
for
a
hot
sweaty
day
in
the
sun
served
in
recommended
glassware
overall
this
beer
is
tasty
zesty
and
crisp
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
o
a
solid
beer
that
is
both
subtle
and
flavorful
perfect
for
the
warm
summer
days
ahead
overall
wits
arent
my
thing
but
this
had
enough
interesting
flavors
to
keep
me
well
interested
first
impression
of
this
beer
made
me
skeptical
most
likely
caused
by
the
label
it
was
purchased
among
two
byo
6packs
from
whole
foods
long
story
short
this
clean
refreshing
light
bodied
beer
is
by
far
the
best
belgium
white
wheat
ive
enjoyed
12
ounce
bottle
into
pint
glass
bottled
on
11262012
pours
very
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
1
finger
dense
white
head
with
great
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
spotty
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
a
good
amount
of
streaming
carbonation
retaining
the
head
aromas
of
big
lemon
orange

coriander
clove

wheat
floral
and
yeast
earthiness
fantastic

with

with
good
robustness
and
zero
cloying
flavors
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
lightly
creamy
crisp
and
very
smooth
mouthfeel
that
is
great
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
witbier
all
around
great
balance
and
complexity
of
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
far
exceeded
expectations
for
sure
very
nice
feel
with
an
airy
bubbly
refreshing
character
just
not
going
to
light
the
world
on
fire
overall
id
definitely
buy
it
again
it
tasted
great
and
gave
me
the
mouth
feel
i
love
in
heavier
beers
without
spoiling
my
appetite
ill
also
add
that
it
goes
great
with
spicy
foods
like
the
curry
i
made
last
night
o
mean
not
terrible
or
exciting
overall
a
decent
wit
serving
type
can
beautiful
bronze
can
mouth
feel
is
very
light
lighter
than
lagers
may
be
smooth
as
hell
very
easy
to
drink
moderate
carbonation
enjoyed
this
beer
at
a
reception
before
dinner
nice
citrus
taste
fruity
without
being
too
much
so
smooth
easy
to
drink
no
strong
bite
or
aftertaste
not
heavily
sweet
i
would
buy
this
anytime
i
often
enjoy
a
good
lager
and
i
had
one
when
this
beer
ran
out
and
it
was
not
as
good
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
white
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus
some
spice
taste
is
good
citrus
up
front
some
mild
spices
at
the
finish
very
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
i
imagine
it
would
be
refreshing
during
the
summer
overall
this
is
a
thin
beer
and
barely
a
witbier
i
expect
either
effervescence
or
body
and
since
there
is
so
little
carbonation
something
needs
to
make
up
for
it
but
doesnt
the
flavor
leaves
a
strong
sugary
aftertaste
that
bittertart
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
to
my
palate
is
offputting
honestly
a
blue
moon
on
tap
is
a
lot
better
than
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
small
white
head
nose
feature
light
bready
wheat
heavy
coriander
and
highlights
of
orange
the
taste
is
mild
with
wheat
up
front
and
the
spice
character
follows
nice
refreshing
and
straight
forward
wit
mouthfeel
is
light
an
refreshing
overall
nice
easy
drinking
beer
i
am
pouring
this
from
the
tap
in
my
garage
out
of
a
5
gallon
i
am
not
basing
my
comment
on
a
4
oz
taster
in
a
bar
somewhere
i
am
nearly
through
a
5
gl
tank
of
this
and
i
would
usually
have
an
ipa
on
tap
so
a
pale
ale
like
this
is
going
to
be
scrutinized
every
time
i
change
the
laundry
in
my
garage
where
the
beer
is
this
is
not
a
weissen
beer
whoever
thinks
that
is
mistaken
this
is
a
pale
ale
with
some
added
spice
that
actually
makes
it
even
better
a
surprisingly
white
creamy
head
you
cant
pigeon
hole
this
beer
sounds
like
the
dryer
just
shut
off
im
gonna
go
check
on
that
overall
a
fairly
easy
drinking
and
tasty
brew
but
in
many
ways
just
on
in
the
crowd
witbiers
nothing
was
bad
but
nothing
really
stood
out
either
a
decent
brew
by
avery
that
i
enjoyed
but
not
sure
if
i
would
come
back
to
this
maybe
during
summer
time
while
grilling
up
some
burgers
but
not
something
i
would
really
have
again
as
a
desert
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
developed
a
light
frothy
head
appeared
highly
carbonated
like
many
of
the
belgian
beers
color
was
a
hazy
straw
with
lots
of
bubbles
aroma
was
sweet
and
of
citrus
and
grain
taste
was
light
with
hints
of
lemon
and
orange
and
a
grain
aftertaste
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carbonated
summary
not
a
bad
witbier
but
in
my
opinion
blue
moon
or
leines
sunset
wheat
do
it
better
its
decent
one
of
my
very
favorites
beers
in
a
can
great
taste
i
am
a
big
fans
of
white
and
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
whites
12oz
bottle
fresh
from
the
brewery
super
hazy
yellowwhite
appearance
very
cool
how
some
beers
can
appear
white
aroma
is
heavy
spice
and
yeast
flavor
is
oranges
yeast
spice
and
seems
like
it
fits
the
style
well
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
see
myself
ever
purchasing
tried
this
beer
in
a
bottle
and
on
tap
if
you
enjoy
a
true
wheat
beer
you
will
love
this
one
it
has
a
full
body
and
tastes
of
hints
of
coriander
and
citrus
but
not
overpowering
with
fruit
flavor
very
clean
flavor
without
a
bad
aftertaste
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
daily
and
would
if
i
could
get
it
locally
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
and
lacing
were
both
pretty
good
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
citrusy
as
well
as
a
little
peppery
the
taste
is
orangey
some
subtle
wheat
notes
come
through
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
decent
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
not
the
best
wit
but
still
worth
trying
this
held
up
pretty
good
for
age
subtle
signs
of
age
but
really
not
an
issue
good
solid
wit
tastefeel
wet
trunk
its
not
appealing
its
certainly
drinkable
and
the
bananas
help
it
out
but
whatevers
causing
that
wet
trunk
taste
is
not
encouraging
me
to
drink
another
one
of
these
ive
had
worse
but
as
far
as
a
witbier
this
is
my
least
favorite
of
the
style
its
just
offputting
o
not
bad
but
not
great
above
average
witbier
better
than
blue
moon
for
sure
o
it
is
a
decent
beer
but
my
appreciation
for
the
style
is
waning
overall
this
is
a
very
accessible
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
people
who
dont
like
beer
say
oh
but
i
do
like
that
one
about
that
is
not
to
say
it
cannot
be
appreciated
by
a
baer
no
it
isnt
my
first
choice
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
intensity
that
i
typically
seek
in
my
brews
on
the
sweeter
side
but
well
crafted
and
highly
drinkable
perfect
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
considerably
thicker
than
most
ive
encountered
in
this
style
lacing
is
quite
good
as
well
and
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
carbonation
visible
in
the
glass
smell
is
lemony
with
a
good
wheat
twang
spices
are
well
represented
with
a
nice
dollop
of
coriander
a
hint
of
banana
in
the
back
taste
follows
the
nose
with
a
great
wheat
malt
core
and
good
spice
component
lemony
bright
with
a
slightly
tart
dryness
a
bit
of
light
crackery
malt
and
faint
bananaclove
with
a
dash
of
black
pepper
feel
is
light
with
a
smooth
crisp
carbonation
superbly
drinkable
and
a
great
version
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
ive
had
well
done
avery
all
and
all
a
decent
beer
but
im
not
sure
that
this
style
is
for
me
overall
drinkability
glad
i
bought
just
one
not
something
i
would
try
again
overall
a
subpar
wit
good
looking
beer
and
neat
name
and
label
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
oh
well
not
every
beer
can
be
amazing
this
is
an
ok
beer
i
would
like
more
of
the
wheat
and
promised
orange
peel
to
come
through
the
malt
and
yeast
give
off
a
heavy
white
grape
note
similar
to
a
scaled
down
tripel
its
easy
to
drink
but
boring
i
wont
buy
this
again
update
i
just
drank
12
oz
of
this
in
about
five
minutes
flat
did
i
mention
it
was
an
easy
drinker
my
whole
foods
sells
craft
beer
singles
and
i
noticed
this
one
on
the
shelf
and
only
picked
up
one
in
a
can
might
i
addkudos
to
avery
because
cans
are
the
way
to
go
imoim
glad
i
only
got
one
because
again
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
is
ideal
for
a
craft
beer
beginner
or
a
craft
beer
geek
even
who
doesnt
like
big
beers
thick
beers
or
hoppy
beers
but
also
wants
more
substance
than
a
pilsner
or
light
lager
this
beer
is
a
little
funny
if
the
can
didnt
tell
me
otherwise
id
guess
that
its
a
hefe
not
a
wit
but
whatever
it
is
its
tasty
smell
full
of
warm
spices
is
a
highlight
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
although
it
is
just
basically
average
it
pours
a
pale
straw
color
head
with
a
one
finger
head
and
poor
retention
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
smell
is
floral
and
oranges
mouthfeel
is
full
with
plenty
of
carbonation
taste
is
very
citrus
on
the
front
and
mild
hops
on
the
finish
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
if
offered
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
either
just
very
average
an
average
wit
elsewhere
its
the
best
wit
in
a
can
that
i
can
think
of
not
sure
what
thats
worth
a
lot
if
youre
at
the
beach
i
guess
golden
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
lingers
a
bit
smell
is
lemon
grass
and
maybe
some
pepper
flavor
echoes
the
same
it
is
light
yet
with
body
and
refreshing
with
the
spicing
of
this
beer
it
borders
a
saison
flavor
with
a
heavy
dose
of
citrus
poured
into
a
pint
glass
its
party
cloudy
with
mild
carbonation
and
is
a
beautiful
blonde
color
think
of
the
morning
sun
shining
through
a
wheat
field
its
topped
off
with
a
nice
thick
white
head
and
thins
out
into
a
layer
of
uniformed
bubbles
corralled
by
mild
lacing
spices
like
coriander
orange
zest
mild
pepper
corn
and
something
else
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
all
envelope
your
tongue
as
you
drink
its
light
bodied
throughout
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
you
can
taste
some
apple
wheat
orange
zest
as
it
hits
the
sides
and
back
of
your
mouth
its
aftertaste
is
filled
with
a
mild
pepper
corn
flavor
and
its
slightly
bitter
overall
mouthfeel
medium
light
bodied
creamy
with
a
dry
finish
overall
an
ok
witbier
o
nice
everyday
drinking
beer
especially
for
a
hot
day
is
a
simple
well
done
white
beligan
style
beer
overall
people
have
bashed
this
beer
but
it
lives
to
above
of
its
potential
it
is
tasty
and
with
a
crisp
aftertaste
it
is
incredibly
satisfying
salud
not
a
fan
of
belgian
ales
to
begin
with
this
is
par
for
the
course
with
me
definitely
not
the
worst
ive
had
would
still
drink
this
beer
over
any
domestic
lagers
i
will
give
this
beer
a
try
again
in
the
future
just
to
be
certain
that
im
not
on
a
vein
of
ipa
adoration
oh
its
cheap
and
comes
in
cans
yeah
im
sold
too
avery
white
rascal
belgian
white
wow
very
good
belgian
whit
beer
from
avery
i
am
a
whit
beer
fan
but
great
ones
are
hard
to
find
in
the
us
the
white
rascal
is
a
beautiful
pour
with
a
striking
straw
yellow
color
and
pure
white
head
that
does
lace
not
perfectly
clear
but
i
would
not
call
it
hazy
either
the
aroma
has
loads
of
citrus
the
flavor
has
a
balanced
blend
of
citrus
and
honey
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
spices
in
beer
but
the
coriander
blends
well
in
this
brew
avery
produces
a
top
shelf
bomber
series
and
their
mainstream
products
are
above
average
the
white
rascal
is
another
example
of
an
above
average
product
o
very
nice
more
hefe
than
necessary
than
very
enjoyable
odecent
belgian
wit
light
funky
tasty
very
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
nice
light
citrus
beer
i
do
like
this
one
just
needs
some
more
smells
to
make
it
hit
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
fruit
yeast
malt
and
a
hit
of
hoppiness
to
balance
the
sweetness
it
may
not
be
the
prototypical
witbier
but
i
prefer
the
full
complex
flavor
of
this
version
to
its
more
sedate
brethren
overall
a
decent
witbier
but
it
does
not
separate
itself
from
other
examples
of
the
style
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
but
probably
not
seek
it
out
overall
the
flavor
was
a
bit
of
a
let
down
from
what
is
hoped
from
the
taste
its
a
little
too
thin
even
for
the
style
still
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
o
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
sessionable
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
i
could
see
myself
picking
this
up
for
outdoor
events
as
the
beer
is
good
and
the
can
formfactor
is
also
nice
overall
this
is
a
tasty
brew
but
it
certainly
is
strong
in
the
spice
department

o

at

with
the

the

made
up

it
in

overall

a
very
tasty

overall
a

cut
everything
to
make
for
a
clean
finish
noticeable

presence
but
its
quite
nice
tasty
brew
available
in
cans
and
highly
drinkable
im
into
it
overall
this
was
an
okay
beer
a
nice
belgian
white
heavy
on
the
flowery

pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
color
with
almost
no
head
smelld
like
belgian
yeast
and
wheat
malt
flavor
is
yeasty
first
with
a
fruity
sort
of
hop
middle
and
a
crisp
belgian
finish
feel
is
nice
but
not
as
bubbly
as
i
want
it
to
be
i
dont
know
the
yeast
is
the
star
here
and
its
down
easy
but
i
like
a
lot
of
other
avery
beers
a
whole
lot
more
thats
said
its
a
damn
good
american
belgian
wit
no
complaints
really

medium

lightly

a
nice

but
not
one
of
the
classics
of
the
style
pours
a
hazy
light
orange
with
an
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
spices
yeast
and
a
slightly
chalky
aroma
taste
is
of
wheat
and
yeast
with
a
pretty
strong
spice
profile
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
decently
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
great
on
tap
at
bergies
in
old
town
san
diego
pale
golden
in
the
pint
glass
from
a
can
i
know
heresy
obtained
from
a
6
pack
at
qfc
in
university
village
near
uw
campus
aroma
is
very
sweet
banana
citrus
gum
and
very
delicate
very
inviting
a
pleasant
appears
bright
but
translucent
if
you
mixed
orange
juice
with
pineapple
juice
i
feel
like
thats
what
this
looks
like
one
to
two
fingers
of
white
head
tastes
like
sweet
fruity
citrus
pineapple
banana
coconut
plenty
of
other
tropical
fruits
its
not
overly
citrusy
or
carbonated
it
really
has
an
incredible
balance
it
might
be
too
sweet
for
the
average
beer
drinker
but
its
just
right
for
me
palate
has
a
perfect
balance
as
well
good
carbonation
no
bad
residual
flavors
goes
down
smooth
i
cant
think
of
anything
else
i
would
ask
for
overall
this
is
one
of
the
few
beers
that
i
feel
comfortable
buying
a
sixer
of
it
seems
like
no
matter
what
mood
i
am
in
i
could
be
in
the
mood
for
this
this
beer
is
what
turned
me
on
to
avery
and
now
i
know
i
wont
go
wrong
with
picking
up
any
of
their
high
brow
stuff
reviewed
on
03082011

overall
this
is
wellrounded
tasty
and
sessionable
would
drink
again
if
the
time
and
place
were
right
overall
sort
of
an
unusual
beer
no
where
near
what
the
best
wits
offer
but
an
ok
beer
for
a
summer
afternoon
an
above
average
witbier
it
had
decent
lacing
although
i
thought
it
was
too
clear
for
what
i
expect
out
of
a
witbier
smell
and
taste
were
good
bottles
was
good
but
its
was
better
on
tap
at
the
avery
brewing
tasting
event
at
the
liberty
street
tavern
i
would
get
this
again
but
it
would
be
my
third
choice
behind
allagash
white
and
st
bernardus
witbier
d
definitely
a
good
offering
but
far
from
anything
special
humongous
white
head
over
yellow
beer
thats
mostly
clear
but
slightly
hazy
good
lacing
on
the
way
down
smells
great
spices
coriander
i
think
the
taste
is
also
good
very
smooth
wheat
beer
flavor
with
spices
easy
drinking
a
good
session
beer
the
only
real
problem
i
have
with
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
really
really
thin
and
watery
not
as
good
as
hoegaarden
but
pretty
good
i
could
see
downing
a
few
of
these
in
the
summer
time
for
sure
after
getting
tired
of
hoegaardens
as
others
have
said
probably
a
good
stepping
stone
but
id
sooner
reach
for
a
superior
allagash
white
this
beer
really
didnt
do
it
for
me
seemed
to
be
a
little
dull
in
the
flavor
department
m
the
ending
is
good
it
endures
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
with
strong
bitterness
represented
or
formed
by
the
herbs
present
in
this
beer
nice
finger
of
headcloudy
hazy
typical
witbier
color
the
lacing
is
as
ive
never
seen
beforeit
doesnt
disappear
i
got
a
bit
of
a
sinus
thing
going
on
so
my
smell
isnt
up
to
snuff
for
now
has
a
bit
more
bite
than
most
witsmaybe
a
tad
more
coriander
notes
also
a
good
a
brew
overall
though
o
a
nice
belgian
white
could
be
a
bit
more
complex
in
the
flavor
a
very
straight
forward
belgian
style
wit
pretty
good
nothing
outrageous
probably
a
good
stepping
stone
for
someone
who
drinks
blue
moon
or
shock
top
i
let
this
warm
a
bit
out
of
the
fridge
poured
with
a
huge
fluffy
frothy
foamy
sudsy
off
white
head
that
was
short
lived
and
some
clingy
lace
color
is
a
very
slightly
hazy
amber
with
no
bubble
trails
aroma
is
mainly
yeast
with
some
malt
fruit
spice
bread
dough
flavor
is
fruit
malt
a
little
spice
and
some
tang
but
not
sure
where
from
body
is
ok
and
carbonation
seems
a
bit
light
finish
is
estery
like
flavor
and
average
length
ok
beer
nothing
special
o
i
may
have
just
got
a
funky
smelling
beer
and
im
willing
to
try
it
again
because
of
the
positives
on
all
the
other
fronts
o
this
beer
is
a
mixed
bag
it
looks
good
and
the
heavier
mouthfeel
and
higher
alcohol
content
help
it
to
stand
out
from
a
rapidly
growing
crowd
the
hohum
flavor
profile
and
unimpressive
aroma
though
make
it
a
beer
that
i
will
not
seek
out
regularly
not
bad
but
not
great
either
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
very
very
drinkable
it
was
actually
pretty
complex
for
a
witbier
and
i
felt
it
had
a
lot
to
offer
but
still
it
wasnt
a
big
standout
beer
for
me
during
a
week
of
126
beer
tastings
good
but
not
amazing
overall
i
feel
this
would
be
a
great
beer
if
avery
would
tone
down
the
amount
of
coriander
they
add
to
this
brew
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
white
two
finger
head
good
lacing
on
my
snifter
glass
very
cloudy
in
appearance
nose
is
corriander
wheat
malt
pepper
pretty
typical
for
this
style
nice
and
crisp
smelling
beer
and
very
balanced
taste
is
the
same
profile
although
id
like
just
a
tad
more
malt
in
there
feel
is
medium
for
the
style
w
a
nice
smooth
malty
finish
malt
and
spices
last
well
into
the
aftertaste
overall
this
is
a
good
witbier
definitely
worth
checking
out
not
the
best
ive
had
but
still
solid
4
0
d
i
enjoyed
this
a
good
bit
but
admittedly
its
hard
to
disappoint
me
with
a
witbier
solid
all
around
o
i
realize
most
of
my
reviews
tend
to
be
on
larger
beers
but
i
do
like
sessionables
as
well
i
might
not
seek
this
out
again
because
while
it
is
light
and
drinkable
there
isnt
necessarily
anything
different
about
it
nothing
drawing
me
back
towards
buying
it
light
yeastyness
a
touch
of
light
bread
malt
some
grassy
hops
and
thats
about
it
best
described
as
a
lighter
hefeweizen
recommended
for
your
sister
in
law
who
only
drinks
blue
moon
throw
a
lemon
in
there
for
her
i
occasionally
have
this
on
tap
at
avery
but
only
on
the
warmest
days
o
pretty
much
everything
i
look
for
in
a
witbier
this
taste
is
something
different
for
me
but
its
definitely
better
in
a
good
way
this
could
easily
be
a
drink
that
i
could
knock
a
few
back
not
too
heavy
and
it
has
enough
flavor
that
its
better
than
a
light
beer
even
though
this
beer
was
solid
im
still
in
no
rush
to
drink
another
one
though
one
of
the
better
american
takes
on
a
style
that
usually
is
over
flavored
and
not
refreshing
this
one
though
is
tastefully
designed
and
very
refreshing
highly
recommended
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
witbier
and
so
far
it
is
the
best
one
i
have
had
i
find
most
beers
in
the
style
have
a
5050
mix
of
orange
zest
and
spices
but
with
this
beer
the
oranges
taste
more
fresh
and
juicy
then
zesty
and
they
outweighed
the
spices
i
liked
the
this
combination
it
was
pretty
different
from
most
witbiers
and
pretty
tasty
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
the
fresh
oranges
really
stuck
out
and
it
wasnt
overly
spicy
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
the
color
could
have
been
brighter
with
much
better
head
and
retention
but
that
isnt
that
big
of
a
deal
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
and
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
a
couple
of
these
on
the
disc
golf
course
i
will
for
sure
buy
this
beer
again
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
witbier
fan
this
was
my
first
beer
from
avery
and
it
made
for
a
good
first
impression
i
will
be
on
the
look
out
for
more
of
their
beer
o
not
a
great
beer
but
pretty
good
its
a
nice
change
from
some
of
the
more
common
styles
of
beer
a
little
heavy
on
the
orangefruitiness
for
me
to
drink
too
often
but
worth
checking
out
a
flavorful
and
wonderfully
aromatic
witbier
o
a
damn
good
light
belgian
pale
ale
i
will
buy
this
again
thought
this
was
too
heavily
hopped
otherwise
not
bad
flavors
but
this
style
doesnt
really
benefit
from
this
much
bitterness
in
my
opinion
overall
its
a
nice
witbier
and
great
that
its
in
a
can
overall
impression
this
is
much
more
refreshing
and
interesting
than
ive
had
before
has
a
good
orange
smell
and
taste
and
has
a
good
finish
will
be
getting
more
of
these
for
float
trips
over
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
its
decent
but
its
not
especially
unique
or
exciting
that
sticks
out
the
next
time
anybody
ask
me
for
recommendations
regarding
the
witbier
style
poured
a
cloudy
strawyellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retained
and
laced
well
bready
yeast
on
the
nose
a
bit
funky
with
notes
of
grass
and
citrus
zest
similar
taste
yeasty
bready
wet
grass
some
pear
and
lemon
crisp
appropriately
carbonated
lightbodied
and
quite
drinkable
for
the
style
an
alright
wit
but
not
upper
tier
by
any
means
still
great
to
see
another
choice
in
canned
beer
though
drinkability
my
first
belgian
from
a
can
and
an
excellent
one
i
instinctively
swirled
the
last
bit
looking
for
some
yeast
sediment
and
found
none
but
other
than
that
not
much
difference
between
this
and
a
bottle
overall
there
are
a
lot
of
witbiers
available
in
cans
these
days
and
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
i
like
it
more
than
hoegaarden
personally
and
yes
even
hoegaarden
comes
in
cans
over
in
belgium
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
it
was
a
much
better
experience
than
the
salvation
i
would
like
to
try
some
more
averys
o
probably
wouldnt
have
again
but
rather
recommended
its
alright
and
drinkable
o
a
very
awesome
brew
but
lacks
flavor
depth
this
went
down
easy
enough
could
easily
go
for
a
few
more
im
always
checking
out
averys
smaller
beers
as
they
are
spot
on
when
fresh
na
zdravje
d
very
good
rendition
of
a
wit
and
a
neat
looking
can
to
boot
most
certainly
worth
your
hard
earned
dollar
o
overall
a
good
witbier
if
you
like
orange
this
beer
might
as
well
be
called
orangeaide
before
tucking
into
the
food
i
poured
a
glass
cloudy
gold
with
a
substantial
head
and
sticky
lacing
coating
the
pint
glass
along
with
a
definite
lemony
aroma
first
draught
lots
of
citrus
and
yeast
theres
a
creamy
smoothness
to
this
beer
that
follows
the
initial
taste
blast
next
time
ill
try
it
solo
and
update
here
d
overall
i
would
probably
order
this
one
on
tap
with
pizza
if
i
were
out
of
state
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
oks
distro
of
avery
is
gone
though
so
i
am
glad
that
my
pops
sent
one
for
me
to
try
d
not
much
to
write
home
about
but
nice
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
this
was
an
okay
beer
overall
very
flavorful
wit
worthy
poured
from
the
tap
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
a
tight
active
white
head
that
disapated
slowly
and
laced
nicely
through
the
beer
smell
is
banana
and
clove
some
spice
and
a
bit
of
wheat
malt
taste
is
bright
sweet
with
banana
and

and
some
corriander
very
refreshing
taste
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
nice
constant
feed
of
carbonation
keeping
the
beer
crisp
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
brewe
in
the

body
is

overall
an
easy
drinking

refreshing
beer
particularly
for
the
summer
season
t
this
wasnt
a
bad
wit
by
any
means
but
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
the
flavor
was
a
little
too
heavy
and
sweet
and
the
mouthfeel
felt
a
little
bogged
down
a
lot
of
orange
flavor
and
spice
but
it
lacked
the
light
body
and
subtle
flavors
that
really
great
wits
have
overall
took
this
beer
for
tube
floating
trip
down
the
river
today
the
convience
of
canned
beer
in
the
outdoors
was
ideal
here
i
choose
this
beer
because
i
wanted
a
session
beer
for
a
hot
day
and
i
really
did
not
want
to
drink
any
bmc
beers
and
it
was
not
practical
to
bring
lots
of
bottles
to
the
river
avery
is
a
great
brewery
and
the
canned
craft
beers
was
a
pretty
limited
selection
were
i
was
shopping
at
for
this
trip
this
was
my
best
option
i
had
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
the
bmc
crowd
had
a
pretty
positive
opinion
on
this
beer
might
have
even
converted
a
few
bmc
lovers
into
the
world
of
craft
beer
today
the
beer
is
fairly
spicy
but
the
light
body
helps
keep
the
spiciness
under
control
o
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
is
true
to
style
maybe
doesnt
stand
out
but
certianly
does
not
disappoint
either
d
a
pretty
good
wit
not
quite
as
good
as
allagash
but
a
bit
better
than
hoegaarden
this
is
one
i
could
have
a
couple
of
but
probably
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
overall
an
average
to
slightly
above
average
witbier
that
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
night
this
one
drinks
easy
but
unless
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
witbier
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
m
like
a
loose
girl
it
goes
down
easy
medium
bodied
slight
drying
noticed
with
a
hint
of
stickiness
well
carbonated
to
keep
her
flowing
light
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
avery
beers
ive
had
if
you
like
this
style
i
recommend
this
one
for
sure
pours
a
bright
almost
electric
straw
like
color
with
a
tight
half
finger
stark
white
head
which
gives
way
to
nothing
and
a
slight
soapy
lace
the
aroma
is
of
lemons
and
a
belgium
candy
yeast
strain
the
smell
is
very
bubblegum
like
in
nature
the
taste
is
close
to
the
nose
there
is
a
nice
bubble
gum
belgian
yeast
strain
taste
that
starts
followed
up
by
some
lemonzest
and
then
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
slightly
thin
overall
it
is
a
solid
wit
the
candy
yeast
strain
gives
it
a
slightly
different
flavor
than
others
in
the
class
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
not
medicinal
like
some
in
the
glass
can
be
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
reminds
me
of
being
in
belgium
and
sampling
the
local
fair
if
you
have
not
tried
it
i
recommend
it
this
a
solid
witbier
with
all
the
typical
parts
it
has
a
summery
refreshing
flavor
with
spices
like
coriander
and
a
little
bit
of
pepper
it
has
lemon
and
orange
citrus
notes
and
most
important
that
yeasty
character
that
is
so
important
to
a
good
wit
the
aroma
is
underwhelming
considering
the
flavor
but
the
look
and
feel
edge
above
the
average
good
beer
for
lounging
on
a
nice
day
pretty
good
very
refreshing
summer
offering
d
very
drinkable
this
is
my
new
favorite
wit
less
tart
and
dry
than
allagash
ill
stock
this
when
i
see
it
on
sale
as
a
great
summer
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
lemonwater
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
sticky
bubbles
of
lacing
throughout
the
nose
is
full
of
spices
cardamon
and
clove
the
most
the
taste
is
an
amplified
veraion
of
the
nose
the
spices
create
a
smooth
banana
flavor
that
has
the
clove
and
cream
taste
afterwards
great
lingering
aftertaste
that
leaves
nothing
behind
smooth
mediumbodied
feel
that
coats
the
palate
overall
this
is
one
of
the
better
canned
beers
ive
had
im
impressed
very
drinkable
first
canundrum
how
to
agitate
the
yeast
into
suspension
i
went
with
a
combination
of
rolling
the
can
back
and
forth
on
the
counter
followed
by
a
handheld
back
and
forth
inversion
ala
a
paint
mixer
the
crack
did
not
release
a
gusher
but
i
was
ready
if
it
had
i
repeatedly
interrupted
the
glug
to
cantinue
to
agitate
the
yeast
into
suspension
i
was
met
with
a
finger
of
very
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
moderate
retention
as
a
result
color
was
a
cloudy
hazy
lemonyellow
like
freshsqueezed
grapefruit
juice
and
even
some
floaties
for
good
measure
nose
was
redolent
with
spices
the
coriander
just
reaching
up
to
tweak
my
nose
followed
by
the
zest
of
the
orange
peel
then
the
mustiness
of
the
yeast
i
recently
polished
off
some
blue
moon
in
a
can
that
had
been
hanging
around
but
this
beer
puts
that
one
to
shame
mouthfeel
was
a
tad
thin
but
the
riotous
taste
of
the
spice
the
citrus
and
the
yeast
was
memorable
i
am
still
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
i
know
a
good
one
when
i
taste
it
finish
was
dry
and
refreshing
id
put
some
in
the
cooler
as
long
as
people
agree
not
to
put
fruit
in
it
very
smooth
refreshing
and
easydrinking
without
being
too
onedimensional
o
fairly
laid
back
fruity
type
of
refreshing
summer
cooler
it
is
a
little
thin
on
the
palate
and
couldve
been
a
bit
more
spicy
but
otherwise
is
a
nice
drop
with
enough
substance
to
maintain
your
interest
the
body
is
light
overall
its
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot
day
true
to
the
style
has
a
welcomed
place
at
any
backyard
bbq
not
the
most
impressive
of
the
style
but
a
pretty
good
representation
at
that
i
would
like
to
have
tasted
some
more
play
bw
the
different
flavors
but
id
pick
this
up
again
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
abv
light
body
prosit
o
not
really
enough
taste
or
body
to
feel
like
im
drinking
beer
more
like
lemon
water
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
it
just
didnt
have
anything
that
would
wow
me
just
another
witbier
is
all
overall
this
isnt
the
best
example
of
the
style
out
there
but
at
around
10
for
a
six
pack
you
cant
really
go
wrong
not
a
groundbreaking
beer
but
an
outstanding
value
the
beers
that
most
closely
resembles
the
white
rascal
is
hoegarden
this
beer
poured
light
colored
with
almost
zero
head
it
was
a
little
more
zippyhad
more
zest
than
other
beers
it
was
like
it
was
almost
due
to
the
carbonation
but
i
think
it
was
the
taste
so
that
was
interesting
mouthfeel
was
poor
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
witbier
from
avery
this
pours
banana
colored
with
light
fizzy
head
the
smells
is
the
expected
yeast
and
citrus
i
really
like
how
crisp
and
tart
this
brew
is
it
reminds
me
of
hoegaarden
but
much
better
it
has
a
medium
to
light
body
that
is
zesty
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
because
it
lacks
the
oversoapiness
that
belgium
beers
often
have
this
was
a
decent
enough
witbier
i
suppose
but
it
never
did
find
the
right
balance
of
sweetness
and
spice
for
me
and
just
had
an
overall
thickness
to
the
feel
that
cut
back
on
the
drinkability
of
this
just
had
three
of
these
from
the
can
at
pizza
peel
great
summer
brew
light
airy
and
thirst
quenching
poured
can
into
pint
glass
nice
color
and
had
the
smell
of
corriander
and
a
bit
of
orange
peel
really
good
on
both
accounts
the
taste
was
really
good
given
that
it
was
a
5

most
wits
are
around

nice
balance
and
good
mouthfeel
overall
this
beer
is
a

gulper
high
high

highly
recommend
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
can
ascertain
theres
better
wits
out
there
however
it
does
have
a
couple
of
interesting
things
to
it
somewhere
bonus
points
for
the
sweet
label
tastespices
clove
coriander
orange
zest
very
refreshing
and
flavorfull
easily
poundable
on
a
hot
summers
day
good
value
and
portability
in
can
package
decent
beer
not
the
best
ever
but
satisfying
and
refreshing
o
this
isnt
a
groundbreaking
beer
but
it
is
refreshing
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
on
hand
in
the
future
12oz
bottle
pours
hazy
yellow
with
minimal
white
head
hardly
any
carbonation
bubbles
coriander
and
orange
dominate
the
aroma
along
with
some
wheat
and
some
peppercorn
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
citrus
and
spice
from
the
coriander
medium
bodied
with
with
an
oily
texture
finish
is
a
bit
spicy
and
somewhat
bitter
a
very
nice
witbier
o
i
enjoy
the
flavor
profile
and
nose
of
this
beer
but
the
carbonation
and
spice
goes
a
bit
too
far
in
drying
out
the
tongue
for
my
taste
the
aroma
was
full
of
grain
and
slight
spices
some
small
fruit
notes
pears
mainly
with
a
touch
of
apple
but
this
hay
like
spice
kept
everything
going
rich
notes
of
grass
and
hay
opened
it
up
and
melded
seemlessly
into
a
pear
driven
fruity
yeast
body
very
intresting
and
quite
complex
but
then
the
smack
of
the
spice
hit
you
and
it
was
all
over
really
intense
here
as
the
almost
pepper
like
notes
bounced
all
over
the
tongue
and
really
just
put
on
a
great
show
smooth
as
silk
the
letdown
in
the
finish
was
that
it
was
just
a
tad
thin
and
flat
and
that
really
seemed
to
just
let
it
fade
away
all
too
quickly
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
and
it
a
really
nice
drinker
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
good
summer
beer
as
the
temps
start
to
rise
m
lightbodied
small
carbonation
not
too
much
depthcomplexity
still
refreshing
great
summer
hot
day
drink
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
above
average
overall
it
was
a
decent
and
refreshing
beer
but
not
an
outstanding
beer
of
the
style
another
little
can
love
it
anyway
the
brew
pours
an
impressive
cloudy
golden
yellow
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
frothy
two
finger
head
and
clingy
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
very
spicey
basically
corriander
and
orange
peel
with
a
hint
of
salami

overall
its

witbier
thats
made
for
more
than
one
off
even
if
your
not
the
biggest
fan
of
witbiers
as
it
is
quite
subdued
and
i
must
say
this
brewery
has
eased
my
mind
about
quality
being
limited
to
bottles
as
their
cans
still
contain
quality
flavours
cheers
heavy
bodied
for
the
style
with
decent
carbonation
the
carbonation
is
almost
prickly
when
you
let
this
beer
sit
in
your
mouth
it
is
easily
drinkable
but
not
necessarily
the
thirstquencher
many
would
expect
from
this
style
quite
flavorful
and
an
admirable
job
on
this
belgianstyle
wit
tasty
and
refreshing
d
overall
its
a
good
beer
particularly
in
a
style
that
is
hard
to
please
with
very
nice
easily
quaffable
well
balanced
wit
slightly
yeasty
and
again
big
on
the
orange
tangerine
citrus
quality
throughout
corriander
and
white
pepper
on
the
middle
with
belgian
yeast
and
spice
and
floral
hops
on
the
finish
soft
and
creamy
from
the
wheat
and
just
a
nice
beer
on
a
warm
day
love
the
cans
d
not
a
bad
beer
to
drink
but
it
simply
leaves
you
wanting
more
of
the
flavors
that
should
be
in
a
witbier
notes
nice
witbier
maybe
nothing
outstanding
but
it
hits
the
style
pretty
well
and
it
is
nicely
recommendable
glad
to
see
it
in
cans
although
ironically
one
got
punctured
and
spilled
all
over
the
backpack
luckily
it
was
an
hermetic
comparment
i
guess
it
is
just
a
random
fluke
first
time
it
happened
though
d
very
high
quite
a
good
beer
the
cpj
o
easy
drinking
beer
soft
flavors
nothing
too
out
there
and
would
be
a
good
intro
into
craft
imo
m

body
but
doesnt
have
as
much
carbonation
as
the
appear
would
lead
one
to
believe
finishes
sweet
on
the
palate
but
the
aftertaste
of
spicy
oranges
fades
rather
quickly

clean
and
refreshing

a
hazy

golden
color
with
vivid
white

of

right
away
on
the
palate
with
some
contrasting
sweet
n
sour
flavors
going
on
into
the
finish
finish
is
moderately
long
with
some
wheaty
components
lingering
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
outstanding
with
breakfast
that
has
eggs
and
cheese
in
it
overallso
if
im
comparing
this
to
many
ipas
that
i
enjoy
i
would
much
rather
drink
the
ipas
but
for
the
style
i
really
like
this
beer
ive
had
nearly
everything
avery
offers
and
never
tried
their
white
rascal
excellent
hot
summer
day
beer
and
a
great
way
to
try
and
lure
in
your
significant
other
to
craft
beers
definitely
will
purchase
this
again
great
session
beer
as
well
o
not
bad
overall
id
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
and
thirsty
day
it
has
some
flavor
spice
not
much
bitterness
on
the
aftertaste
and
is
safe
enough
to
have
more
than
one
a
drinker
not
a
sipper
a
good
beer
to
introduce
a
noncraft
beer
drinker
into
the
realm
would
have
appeal
to
mass
market
drinkers
and
crafters
overall
good
very
drinkable
not
very
complex
but
better
tasting
than
a
lot
of
other
witbiers
out
there
a
nice
medium
body
and
smooth
carbonation
make
for
a
drinkable
beer
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
i
cant
complain
about
the
mouthfeel
really
too
bad
it
doesnt
make
up
for
the
lack
of
achievement
elsewhere
i
give
it
points
for
the
fennel
seed
originality
but
this
is
overall
a
belowaverage
to
average
witbier
i
wont
be
ordering
this
one
again
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
is
a
little
more
manly
tasting
than
your
average
witbier
which
i
appreciate
i
would
definitely
pick
this
up
in
lieu
of
some
more
expensive
witbiers
out
there
to
share
with
the
gf
who
likes
the
style
a
lot
better
than
expected
served
ontap
at
the
la
jolla
brewhouse
in
ca
the
beer
was
poured
in
a
pint
glass
and
it
was
a
yellowish
coloring
that
almost
seemed
to
have
a
green
tint
to
it
the
beer
was
hazy
and
unfiltered
and
it
had
a
white
frothy
head
on
it
spicy
nutmeg
aroma
with
clove
and
citrus
notes
as
well
creamy
body
with
smooth
flavors
of
citrus
and
spice
herb
highlights
throughout
the
beer
as
well
with
hints
of
parsley
and
basil
tart
from
the
citrus
with
a
clean
finish
and
a
spicy
aftertaste
on
tap
at
a
beer
festival
poured
into
a
sampler
glass
from
notes
pours
golden
and
slightly
hazy
with
a
little
white
head
it
does
keep
a
good
lacing
going
nose
is
fairly
strong
and
dominated
by
bitter
citrus
coriander
and
belgian
yeast
flavor
is
a
good
balanced
witbier
with
orange
peel
spice
a
mediumbig
malt
low
hops
and
a
little
yeast
all
coming
through
without
a
distinct
front
or
backside
to
the
flavor
very
similar
to
hoegaarden
but
a
little
thinner
on
the
palate
the
palate
is
interesting
it
is
spicier
than
many
wits
especially
when
cold
as
it
warms
a
nice
orange
fruit
quality
comes
forward
a
little
more
it
goes
down
easily
the
combo
of
spiceness
and
fruitness
make
it
fairly
refreshing
while
it
also
the
little
bit
of
slickness
makes
it
more
smooth
than
crisp
light
yellow
cloudy
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
orange
coriander
and
wheat
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
it
is
amazingly
averageits
just
like
the
hundreds
of
other
witbiers
out
there
i
wouldnt
recommend
and
i
doubt
i
would
ever
buy
this
again
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
this
beer
also
has
great
drinkability
dm
crisp
and
drinkable
has
some
weight
while
maintaining
a
very
good
profile
very
refreshing
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
havent
had
many
of
this
style
so
i
probably
cant
review
it
as
well
as
some
it
has
a
nice
light
fruity
taste
and
good
mouth
feel
the
color
is
a
beautiful
hazy
white
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
yes
a
whole
six
pack
avery
has
good
beers
overall
i
tried
a
nice
ipa
of
theirs
and
i
think
a
brown
ale
quite
a
bright
happy
beer
with
a
whimsical
quality
which
makes
it
good
for
what
it
is
like
i
said
additional
carbonation
wouldve
been
nice
or
more
belgian
yeast
quality
in
the
nose
d
very
drinkable
with
an
ok
taste

d
solid
witbier
not
my
fav
but
its
still
pretty
good
dont
go
out
of
your
way
for
this
but
a
fine
session
and
summer
beer
the
appearance
was
that
of
a
white
beer
on
the
clear
side
slight
cloudiness
and
minimal
sediment
whatever
head
came
from
the
poor
quickly
disappeared
it
has
a
strong
citrus
taste
with
hops
and
a
light
finish
of
bitterness
it
is
a
good
beer
for
the
price
and
is
drinkable
especially
with
food
i
had
it
with
chicken
corn
and
sourdough
bread
and
it
paired
nicely
a
decent
beer
that
my
fond
memories
of
tasting
at
the
avery
tap
room
now
seem
overblown
after
two
reviews
bottle
and
can
i
believe
this
is
a
good
brew
but
nothing
extraordinary
to
my
palate
it
was
not
a
great
beer
but
it
was
very
good
appears
a
clouded
apricot
golden
orange
hue
with
haziness
galore
id
call
this
unfiltered
fine
intricate
lacing
left
as
the
bright
white
head
dwindles
aroma
has
orange
peel
citrus
fruit
clove
with
hints
of
coriander
and
even
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
this
is
very
nice
witbier
flavor
spiced
with
citrus
peel
coriander
hints
of
clove
with
a
refreshing
yeast
spiciness
more
tropical
fruits
hints
of
chammomile
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
sturdy
effervescent
carbonation
carries
the
beer
pretty
well
drinkability
was
effortless
the
right
type
of
beer
to
drain
for
sure
enjoyable
and
approachable
to
all
im
surprised
ive
nevere
reviewed
this
beer
its
one
that
ive
tasted
multiple
times
over
the
years
this
is
a
very
light
styled
beer
and
great
for
hot
summer
days
one
finger
white
head
pale
cloudy
strraw
body
sweet
banana
and
orange
smell
bitter
with
noticable
alcohol
like
biting
into
a
limeorange
hybrid
reminiscent
of
wine
smooth
mouthfeel
with
a
little
bit
of
a
bite
id
drink
again
but
any
place
youre
likely
to
find
this
stuff
might
have
a
better
witbier
so
its
easy
to
pass
this
one
up
this
was
the
first
beer
that
i
have
almost
poured
out
it
was
not
bad
like
a
bmc
those
having
no
flavor
whatsoever
but
a
bad
flavor
profile
i
was
very
disappointing
with
the
taste
too
much
of
a
spice
flavor
for
me
nice
beer
avery
brewing
co
lacks
a
lot
of
the
character
that
make
a
good
witbierthe
orange
in
the
flavor
combined
with
an
alcohol
undertone
which
shouldnt
be
there
comes
off
almost
like
flavored
vodka
i
love
avery
but
this
one
just
isnt
up
to
snuff
the
lacing
is
made
up
of
very
pretty
and
uniform
bubbles
of
medium
size
avery
makes
good
things
and
this
is
the
first
can
i
have
tried
from
them
i
would
buy
again
d
like
most
beers
like
this
drinkability
is
good
but
the
cheapest
found
is
10
99
a
sixer
and
thats
a
pretty
good
price
would
consider
if
getting
something
light
d
the
aroma
was
so
promising
but
overall
this
beer
is
shooting
for
typical
and
falls
just
shy
of
that
fairly
standard
aromas
clove
yeast
coriander
wheat
and
lemon
are
the
most
noticeable
more
of
the
citrus
and
wheat
on
the
tongue
than
the
nose
light
bodied
nice
amount
of
carbonation
and
refreshing
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
couple
of
these
in
a
hot
summer
day
d
i
would
not
turn
one
of
these
down
but
at
the
same
time
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
another
six
pack
a
hazy
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
impressive
lacing
that
sticks
smells
of
yeast
phenols
taste
is
light
sugary
bread
up
front
with
a
nice
yeast
profile
in
the
middle
and
an
earthy
finish
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
low
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
future
outlook
nothing
to
get
my
pulse
racing
but
plenty
enjoyable
not
one
to
seek
out
but
not
one
to
sneer
at
if
i
happen
to
find
in
my
glass
again
peace
d
the
yeast
citrus
and
spice
qualities
are
all
supported
by
a
nice
pale
malt
base
there
is
lots
of
character
and
it
is
very
drinkable
with
the
bottle
being
way
to
small
drinkability
tastes
so
good
i
could
drink
it
all
day
for
a
light
bodied
beer
this
is
pretty
good
very
drinkable
theres
just
just
not
that
much
to
it
d
one
of
the
spicier
wits
ive
tried
a
little
over
spiced
for
my
liking
the
six
pack
i
bought
was
well
received
by
my
non
beer
loving
family
d
highly
drinkable
and
a
good
wit
md
a
decent
witbier
hits
all
the
style
notes
perfectly
but
nothing
really
stands
out
not
the
best
out
there
but
worth
the
9

a
six
pack
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
head
almost

in

smells
of
faint
hops
and

wheat

for

a

its

to

with

db
a

surprise
witbier
or
any
belgian
with
similar
yeast
flavor
is
not
my
first
choice
but
i
am
enjoying
this
one
i
guess
the
relatively
relaxed
or
balanced
yeast
and
spice
makes
this
one
refreshing
and
drinkable
nice
crisp
body
and
easy
drinkability
not
an
outstanding
wit
but
nicely
balanced
and
goes
down
well
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
this
is
an
easy
drink
i
do
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
as
i
said
above
there
are
better
wits
out
there
but
this
one
has
a
bit
of
a
identity
of
its
own
its
very
refreshing
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
the
light
yellow
color
reminds
me
of
lemonade
a
light
weight
head
that
is
basically
white
sat
on
top
of
this
beer
for
a
very
short
time
there
is
a
little
citrus
in
the
nose
and
oranges
i
get
too
much
yeast
like
notes
and
some
cloves
as
well
it
is
very
refreshing
and
light
without
losing
the
mouth
feel
it
still
has
a
creamy
feeling
the
finish
is
a
little
rough
the
beer
has
a
dry
feeling
with
plenty
of
clove
sticking
to
the
back
of
your
tongue
im
not
a
fan
of
the
clove
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
perfect
for
an
oklahoma
summer
day
this
witbier
pours
a
very
hazy
orange
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
its
smells
yeasty
with
spices
of
coriander
and
some
orange
zest
the
light
bodied
beer
brings
te
flavor
of
orange
peel
yeast
light
malt
with
spices
this
is
an
average
at
best

drink
white
rascal
was
enjoyed
during
a
mini
wit
tasting
and
stood
out
in
its
mediocrity
a
very
average
witbier

body
was
nice
and
full
for
a
wit
that
paired
with
crisp
carbonation

us
with

wheat
with
no

pours
a
pale
apricot
orange
with
a
nice
billowing
white
head
and
a
good
amount
of
lace
rings
as
it
goes
down
the
glass
nose
brings
forward
some
citrus
and
wheat
along
with
a
hint
of
spice
spice
comes
out
more
in
the
flavor
which
still
brings
mostly
a
wheaty
sweetness
and
a
bit
of
orange
and
citrus
feel
is
a
bit
thick
and
starts
to
feel
almost
like
a
shake
drinks
alright
but
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
d
this
is
not
what
i
look
for
in
a
witbier
too
much
like
a
crappy
brewpub

and
just

great

high
drinkability
in
my
book
not
the
best
beer
out
there
but
not
one
i
would
ever
turn
down
good
stuff
dgood
drinkability
and
a
true
representation
of
the
style
but
nothing
spectacular
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
rather
refreshing
although
not
quite
as
thirst
quenching
as
some
of
the
other
types
of
witbiers
that
are
available
i
think
this
had
been
sitting
on
the
shelf
for
awhile
only
comment
here
is
that
i
dont
think
it
needed
coriander
and
could
have
been
more
clean
without
it
natural
tastes
in
this
style
already
lean
in
that
direction
doesnt
really
need
the
help
in
my
humble
opinion

a
friend
of
mine
took
a
sip
and
loved
it
said
he
thought
it
was
a
good
flavorful
wheat
pretty
good
job
overall
i
like
this
one
a
lot
what
i
dont
get
is
orange
ive
had
so
much
orange
that
i
can
dig
some
lemon
once
in
a
while
especially
when
it
is
from
the
yeast
is
it
ill
assume
it
is
i
wonder
if
they
brew
it
with
lemon
peel
or
is
it
just
good
yeast
m
nice
mellow
smooth
body
it
finishes
very
silky
smooth
overall
a
nice
witbier
again
not
as
smooth
as
i
usually
like
my
beers
i
like
how
light
and
simple
it
is
which
does
make
it
easy
to
drink
in
that
regard
highly
recommended
compared
to
other
witbiers
ive
tried
i
had
a
sixteen
ounce
pour
of
this
at
amsterdam
ale
house
in
manhattans
upper
west
side
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
brewery
but
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
witbier
overall
this
was
a
decent
beer
but
because
i
dont
love
witbier
ill
probably
not
have
it
again
too
soon
but
it
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
if
you
like
it
a
very
clean
wit
with
solid
flavors
a
tiny
bit
watered
down
but
still
a
very
refreshing
brew
nice
spice
profile
d
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
with
plenty
of
depth
for
its
size
definitely
worth
a
try
d
i
like
this
for
an
afternoon
drink
or
for
a
party
not
an
exceptional
beer
but
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
the
simplicity
of
it
living
in
co
i
have
been
drinking
this
beer
for
years
but
had
it
last
night
and
decided
to
review
it
have
to
say
it
was
the
best
bottle
i
have
ever
had
maybe
the
tweaked
the
recipe
but
it
just
tasted
much
more
vibrant
would
guess
it
was
just
really
fresh
i
did
drink
it
in
boulder
d
this
is
a
decent
witbier
the
beer
lacks
some
spice
complexity
however
and
the
malt
seems
to
lack
the
raw
wheat
character
typical
of
the
style
technically
its
not
really
flawed
but
lacks
interest
still
its
good
on
a
hot
day
like
this
one
very
drinkable
a
composite
of
decent
to
good
parts
make
for
a
refreshing
and
crisp
brew
d
what
a
great
hot
day
beer
id
nab
this
over
any
of
the
mass
produced
wits
any
day
drinkability
a
nice
summer
brew
the
spiciness
is
subdued
but
keeps
it
from
being
a
quaffer
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
either
d
this
is
just
okay
i
sure
wouldnt
pay
money
for
it
again
it
was
little
taste
and
no
muscle
the
very
first
thing
you
will
notice
when
you
crack
open
a
white
rascal
is
the
odd
aroma
this
beer
is
ale
brewed
with
spices
according
to
the
label
but
what
spices
the
taste
is
very
bitter
like
someone
mixed
in
dill
or
paprika
or
some
other
spice
that
does
not
really
belong
in
a
beer
its
a
shame
because
avry
brewing
co
is
usually
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
i
must
admit
i
am
disappointed
in
this
brew
because
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
still
not
as
bad
as
an
mgd
though
d
pretty
drinkable
not
very
exciting
however
as
there
a
lot
better
witts
out
there
a
very
pale
yellow
color
pour
with
a
medium
sized
lasting
head
lively
carbonation
aroma
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
as
promised
with
some
peppery
spice
and
wheat
notes
flavor
is
spicy
lots
of
coriander
peppery
with
some
lemon
and
orange
tangy
wheat
and
just
a
hint
of
babana
light
bitterness
oily
mouthfeel
medium
body
quite
drinkable
pretty
good
d
ive
always
like
wheat
beers
i
find
them
generally
to
be
extremely
drinkable
and
this
is
no
exception
the
light
character
and
refreshing
taste
make
this
a
great
beer
to
toss
in
the
cooler
on
a
very
hot
day
this
is
on
my
buy
again
list
for
sure
d
easy
to
drink
a
really
good
beer
i
would
love
to
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
crisp
fizzy
amount
of
carbonation
an
easy
drinker
just
a
hair
behind
the
belgians
needs
a
touch
more
intensity
to
be
great
so
very
good
terrific
hot
weathersummer
beer
very
decent
domestic
product
it
has
that
nice
cloudy
pale
golden
color
and
a
cloveyeasty
aroma
but
its
not
an
overspiced
wit
it
has
a
nice
clean
wheat
flavor
that
lends
itself
to
having
several
while
there
is
a
hint
of
clove
and
banana
its
in
the
back
and
you
just
get
a
nice
wheat
kick
very
good
mouthfeel
also
lends
to
the
drinkibility
taking
a
drink
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
mouth
feel
the
spice
notes
are
rather
subdued
letting
the
wheat
to
shine
through
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
especially
on
a
summer
day
d
its
not
the
highest
quality
wit
but
its
probably
damn
near
the
smoothest
if
it
were
a
little
tastier
it
would
be
a
great
affordable
option
for
an
easy
drinking
belgianstyle
ale
either
way
it
will
likely
be
purchased
again
especially
if
i
ever
see
it
in
a
can
d
easy
drinking
and
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
low
abv
and
pairs
well
with
flavorful
foods
this
would
be
an
easy
beer
to
session
with
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
terms
of
belgianwheat
ales
i
would
compare
this
to
blue
moon
with
a
little
more
spice
as
far
a
wheat
ales
go
its
alright
but
not
the
best
ive
had
md
pretty
wheaty
brew
not
big
on
this
one
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
wheat
taste
wasnt
for
me
the
mouth
is
slick
with
lower
than
expected
carbonation
it
was
an
enjoyable
change
of
pace
beer
for
me
d
refreshing
for
a
sunny
afternoon
relaxing
i
would
drink
1
or
2
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
comes
much
closer
to
a
true
belgian
witbier
than
many
other
american
attempts
its
a
pretty
average
wit
but
its
drinkable
as
the
style
almost
automatically
implies
not
a
huge
amount
to
recommend
it
but
its
refreshing
and
quaffable
enough
just
remember
there
are
much
better
examples
d
very
drinkable
need
to
get
more
soon
this
beer
is
very
well
composed
its
light
flavour
and
body
make
it
a
great
summer

beer
id
reccomend
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
decent
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
slight
hops
coriander
sweet
malt
and
slight
orange
peel
fits
the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
citrus
slight
sweet
malt
and
slight
hops
overall
a
good
blend
but
body
is
a
little
weak
looks
great
with
some
wispy
yeast
swirling
around
the
pale
straw
colored
body
a
little
more
haze
would
have
been
ideal
good
head
and
lacing
smells
a
little
too
one
dimensional
on
the
banana
front
not
getting
much
else
except
some
alcohol
as
it
warms
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
banana
flavor
but
there
is
a
nice
touch
of
clove
in
the
finish
a
bit
soapy
at
times
though
it
feels
nice
going
down
better
than
your
average
white
notes
nothing
outstanding
but
a
nice
witbier
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
in
the
glass
with
a
nice
collar
of
bright
white
foam
very
yeasty
aroma
with
wheat
spice
and
some
lemon
a
little
tart
on
the
palate
followed
by
citrus
wheat
and
a
little
malt
sweetness
a
good
springsummertime
drinker
looking
forward
to
this
one
in
cans
i
definitely
enjoyed
this
wheat
beer
it
was
a
much
more
drinkable
beer
than
some
of
the
meals
in
bottles
i
have
had
to
guzzle
down
it
had
a
great
overall
flavor
and
was
great
just
out
of
the
bottle
good
color
and
no
terrible
acidity
or
bite
after
each
gulp
i
can
not
wait
to
dive
into
some
more
of
this
already
impressive
line
of
avery
brewing
beers
i
would
recommend
this
to
witbier
lovers
d
an
easy
drinking
witbier
but
not
a
ton
of
flavor
or
great
character
to
go
back
to
again
and
again
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
or
paired
with
a
dry
spicy
dish
but
nothing
too
special
no
complaints
here
this
is
a
solid
brew
creamy
body
from
the
wheat
content
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
easily
drinkable
dgoes
down
easy
but
not
that
tasty
and
a
little
watery
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
slight
haze
and
a
small
pure
white
head
toasty
wheat
light
banana
aroma
lemon
skin
and
a
mild
spicy
note
a
great
summer
brew
from
avery
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
diamond
in
the
rough
sure
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
but
slightly
towards
the
thin
side
drinkability
was
great
as
it
makes
for
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
d
alcohol
isnt
noticeable
crisp
refreshing
flavor
and
hardly
noticeable
on
palate
well
balanced
light
and
easy
drinking
great
summer
time
session
beer
overall
a
good
beer
even
for
those
not
huge
on
wheat
not
averys
best
but
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
this
difficultly
simple
belgian
style
very
smooth
very
mellow
a
basic
good
beer
not
what
im
used
to
by
avery
but
a
solid
brew
value
id
go
up
to
ten
bucks
a
sixer
on
it
comments
i
picked
up
this
bottle
at
the
whole
foods
in
tribeca
d
one
of
the
beers
i
discovered
years
ago
and
go
back
to
every
so
often
always
good
and
a
great
choice
for
belgian
beginners
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
body
with
high
carbonation
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
one
of
the
better
american
versions
of
a
classic
belgian
beer
pours
a
orangishyellow
with
not
much
head
to
speak
of
till
you
swirl
the
yeast
and
pour
it
on
top
smells
of
wheat
citrus
flavor
not
overwhelming
some
wheat
clove
here
citrus
there
everything
pretty
subtle
and
wellblended
dry
finish
which
is
nice
not
sweet
at
all
overall
not
an
outstanding
brew
but
a
very
drinkable
one
would
like
to
try
ontap
to
see
if
anything
else
stands
out
drinkability
yes
a
pretty
decent
brew
procured
at
red
carpet
wine
liquor
glendale
ca
d
very
thin
so
its
easy
to
drink
but
the
whites
dont
really
do
it
for
me
d
good
all
around
light
beer
suitable
for
a
hot
summer
day
and
trying
to
relax
and
cool
down
drinkability
like
most
wits
it
is
pretty
drinkable
however
its
grainy
and
almost
soapy
quality
mean
it
is
not
that
drinkable
d
would
be
great
very
cold
on
a
hot
day
decent
at
all
other
times
maybe
good
with
spicey
food
12oz
poured
a
cloudy
pale
straw
color
with
a
tall
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
were
of
wheat
belgian
yeasts
coriander
and
faint
orange
rind
tastes
were
similar
to
the
aromas
with
the
addition
of
some
banana
notes
mouthfeel
was
fairly
low
carbonation
and
although
light
in
body
the
wheat
noticeably
adds
some
weight
to
the
mouth
alcohol
is
nonexistent
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
soft
but
not
as
soft
as
some
of
the
better
beers
of
its
style
not
particularly
complex
a
bit
grainy
wheat
and
wood
flavors
and
the
separate
elements
of
the
beer
do
not
flow
together
as
well
as
the
score
suggests
were
all
that
weak
the
body
is
a
little
fuller
than
typical
for
the
style
and
has
a
dry
finish
this
style
is
very
drinkable
in
general
and
this
example
has
great
drinkability
even
compared
to
other
wits
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
worth
seeking
out
overall
okay
for
a
wit
note
i
had
to
swirl
the
bottle
on
its
side
for
a
good
minute
or
two
to
get
all
the
yeast
sediment
off
of
the
bottle
and
into
the
glass
it
was
well
worth
the
trouble
d
goes
down
the
hatch
very
easy
could
easily
get
caught
up
drinking
a
few
of
these
brews
brother
d
this
brew
falls
a
little
flat
for
me
the
taste
isnt
spicy
enough
especially
compared
to
the
nose
and
the
sweet
flavors
feel
unbalanced
and
rough
not
a
bad
american
interpretation
of
a
belgian
classic
but
then
again
not
a
great
interpretation
either
after
drinking
both
this
and
hoegaarden
averys
white
rascal
is
far
superior
mfd
slightly
overcarbonated
light
in
body
again
a
little
boring
drinkability
it
is
a
wit
and
it
delivers
on
the
refreshing
aspect
as
well
as
having
a
taste
good
for
a
summer
day
a
good
wit
try
it
out
although
it
has
definitely
taken
a
different
route
than
expected
it
does
have
an
appealing
flavor
and
is
highly
drinkable
it
might
get
flack
for
being
a
lighter
and
more
userfriendly
version
of
the
witbier
but
that
doesnt
stop
it
from
being
a
tasty
little
wheat
ale
and
something
capable
of
heavy
warm
weather
consumption
drinkability
its
not
too
bad
the
flavor
isnt
something
that
catches
my
attention
as
ive
definitely
had
more
flavorful
offerings
but
its
still
refreshing
enough
at
the
end
of
a
long
hot
day
that
i
certainly
dont
mind
drinking
it
for
style
it
is
a
pretty
sweet
beer
as
opposed
to
others
which
enchance
the
citrus
more
for
this
i
find
it
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
going
to
the
beer
store
and
picking
an
avery
is
like
going
to
the
ferrari
dealership
it
doesnt
matter
which
one
you
get
its
going
to
be
awesome
has
a
very
very
light
color
to
it
even
for
a
wit
and
has
a
big
white
head
the
head
is
one
of
those
big
foamy
ones
that
does
not
go
away
quickly
sticks
around
for
a
while
smell
is
nice
and
yeasty
with
notes
of
corriander
and
citrus
fruits
taste
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
the
few
wheat
ales
that
has
a
bit
of
a
malt
kick
to
it
its
mostly
noticable
on
the
after
taste
very
solid
beer
and
it
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
like
today
not
a
bad
summer
beer
nothing
special
but
very
pleasant
something
to
bring
to
a
party
or
bbq
overall
very
classic
belgian
wit
flavors
with
this
ale
the
flavors
are
pronounced
but
not
overwhelming
an
easydrinking
witbier
pours
a
very
light
yellow
slightly
green
with
a
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
ring
of
carbonation
some
nice
lacing
but
nothing
too
outstanding
smells
almost
buttery
but
very
subtle
theres
not
much
aroma
to
this
beer
the
taste
is
soft
and
slightly
bubblegummy
its
a
delicate
style
i
understand
that
but
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
brew
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
its
no
celis
white
or
blanche
de
chambly
d
i
could
definately
polish
off
a
couple
in
one
sitting
d
a
pedestrian
effort
which
i
am
unlikely
to
retread
d
nothing
extraordinary
but
more
than
drinkable
and
would
satisfy
the
unwashed
masses
at
any
summer
gathering
d
very
enjoyable
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
pretty
basic
for
a
wit
but
still
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
in
my
opinion
overall
a
great
quaff
for
the
brutal
south
florida
summer
d
pretty
high
as
a
big
fan
of
wits
this
one
is
no
prized
pig
but
not
a
brew
to
shake
your
finger
at
either
just
a
solid
goto
for
the
price
and
a
local
favorite
of
mine
overall
a
decent
american
wit
and
thirst
quencher
especially
during
the
sweat
months
theres
not
anything
interesting
here
but
everything
is
done
very
well
itd
be
an
easy
choice
to
pick
up
a
sixer
at
least
when
whirlwind
is
out
of
season
drink
a
nice
belgium
witbier
a
good
and
refreshing
drink
perfect
for
warm
days
woul
drink
nice
with
some
sweeter
flavored
dishes
also
good
by
itself
would
buy
it
again
pours
a
cloudy
gold
under
a
white
head
of
moderate
retention
smells
well
like
fruits
and
dirty
laundry
taste
is
a
tartlaundry
water
mix
with
only
14
the
regular
dose
of
tide
pretty
off
to
me
not
enjoying
it
d
this
is
a
damn
good
witbier
at
a
6
pack
for
1
40
per
beer
and
better
than
most
but
doesnt
come
in
12
packs
for
1
04
per
beer
like
sam
adams
seasonal
poured
a
nice
pale
whiteyellow
color
strong
hazy
appearance
and
nice
white
head
light
aroma
with
yeast
and
some
citrus
taste
is
more
nice
yeasts
orange
and
lemon
a
bit
of
nice
grains
and
some
pepper
in
the
finish
lightbodied
with
light
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
and
alcohol
isnt
high
tasty
as
a
quality
session
wit
will
get
again
for
sure
another
pleasant
surprise
i
came
across
at
the
torches
on
the
hudson
restaurant
in
newburgh
ny
it
poured
a
musty
pale
yellowgold
color
with
plenty
of
bubble
action
and
good
sized
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
polite
bready
citrus
and
light
allspice
clean
and
solid
for
the
style
the
taste
is
a
medium
to
light
clovey
bread
with
light
lemon
background
to
the
back
of
the
mouth
its
lively
refreshing
and
clean
refreshment
yet
it
retains
a
consistency
that
truly
suggests
liquid
french
bread
nearly
midbody
with
just
a
bit
of
viscous
feel
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
most
any
situation
this
is
generally
an
easy
style
to
like
but
this
one
certainly
hangs
in
there
as
a
better
than
average
offering
by
my
taste
buds
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
thick
head
that
disappeared
rather
quickly
smells
yeasty
and
corianderclove
spicy
the
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
even
peachy
with
a
clovey
type
spice
good
aftertaste
with
a
nice
tartness
in
the
finish
the
only
thing
i
didnt
really
like
is
that
is
was
very
watery
feeling
and
thin
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
too
much
like
tap
water
but
it
has
a
refreshing
level
of
carbonation
that
keep
it
kind
of
like
mineral
water
and
would
be
nice
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
is
kept
low
by
the
residual
sweetness
tap
pizza
port
sb
poured
a
clear
faint
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
not
a
good
start
pleasant
wheat
and
spice
aroma
sweeter
than
most
taste
was
very
light
even
for
the
style
tart
wheat
and
orange
peel
dominate
some
spice
but
nothing
to
really
distinguish
the
beer
dry
crisp
finish
refreshing
but
lacking
d
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
has
a
nice
lightness
to
it
there
are
better
takes
on
this
style
but
this
is
a
nice
beer
overall
great
witbier
very
complex
and
lots
of
spices
well
worth
a
try
and
will
probably
pick
this
up
again
sometime
overall
carbonation
is
okay
pretty
much
standard
drinkability
is
pretty
good
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
just
not
amazing
d
ive
ever
been
disappointed
with
avery
looking
back
at
my
reviews
the
lowest
score
ive
ever
given
one
of
their
brews
is
3
5
for
ellies
brown
ale
and
that
beer
was
really
good
it
was
just
pretty
basic
all
of
their
big
beers
have
been
kickass
and
this
one
is
a
killer
summer
session
candidate
i
have
a
feeling
that
this
rascal
will
be
a
staple
in
my
fridge
when
the
weather
warms
up
a
bit
just
drinking
this
on
a
25
degree
f
day
puts
images
of
warm
sunny
spring
days
in
my
mind
overall
nice
colorado
belgium
style
witbier
highly
drink
able
and
rather
cheap
d
this
may
be
the
first
of
averys
standard
lineup
that
ive
really
enjoyed
a
solid
witbier
d
very
drinkable
beer
in
a
very
drinkable
style
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
cloudy
slight
haze
yellow
white
head
with
a
respectable
lace
super
sweet
with
a
hint
of
corrinanderclove
orange
peel
and
a
bit
of
funk
from
the
yeast
i
enjoyed
the
mouth
feel
with
the
complex
flavors
but
the
long
lasting
clove
is
a
real
turnoff
and
compromises
the
refreshing
feel
that
most
whites
tend
to
have
it
over
powers
when
it
needs
to
yield
to
the
cleaner
flavors
of
citrus
d
tough
for
me
give
a
perfect
5
on
this
seeing
as
i
only
have
one
bottle
id
like
to
toss
a
couple
back
and
revisit
this
part
of
the
review
this
is
a
refreshing
easy
drinker
i
think
its
my
1st
review
of
an
avery
brew
and
looks
like
i
need
to
try
a
few
more
taste
has
a
lot
of
coriander
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
and
wheat
sharpness
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
big
it
is
not
too
watery
or
flavorless
not
one
of
the
sweetest
funkiest
or
fruitiest
but
maintains
a
good
balance
of
the
three
one
of
the
better
wits
i
have
had
in
a
while
me
gusto
d
this
sort
of
beer
provides
an
accessible
introduction
to
belgianstyle
beer
as
well
as
an
alternative
to
blue
moon
that
said
there
are
much
better
though
more
expensive
versions
on
the
style
out
there
drinkability
this
is
exactly
the
type
of
beer
you
would
want
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
not
the
beer
i
would
reach
for
when
it
gets
chilly
very
refreshing
a
little
too
light
bodied
for
winter
consumption
for
me
good
example
of
the
style
though
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
typical
wheat
haze
small
foamy
head
a
little
bit
of
lace
seems
highly
carbonated
tastes
like
most
wits
ive
had
although
a
bit
on
the
light
side
tinges
of
spices
which
distinguishes
it
a
bit
goes
down
smooth
and
seems
very
drinkable
probably
better
suited
for
the
summer
time
but
not
bad
had
a
bottle
this
past
weekend
at
common
ground
poured
into
a
stangelike
glass
no
carbonation
no
head
pale
orange
color
tasted
like
a
wit
beer
if
i
stretch
my
definition
no
body
whatsoever
very
watery
easy
to
drink
only
because
it
was
like
drinking
iced
tea
not
good
not
how
i
remember
this
beer
from
a
while
back
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
very
light
bodied
not
very
complex
hefe
it
did
fit
the
role
of
a
witbier
only
it
did
not
stand
out
in
any
way
i
did
get
some
of
the
wheat
and
there
was
a
slightly
tangy
aftertaste
poured
this
into
my
weihenstephaner
hefeweissen
glass
and
it
was
a
subtle
yellow
with
a
moderate
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
was
mild
with
the
usual
smells
you
would
expect
from
the
style
taste
was
very
light
with
moderate
ctirus
flavor
was
a
nice
balance
of
carbonation
that
didnt
overwhelm
the
sensed
i
could
definitely
have
several
of
these
on
a
nice
summer
evening
or
after
being
out
doing
yard
work
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
the
style
doesnt
do
much
for
me

overall
this
is
a
really
easy
to
drink
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
recommend
this
as
a
nice
session
beer
d
this
is
a
good
easy
to
drink
beer
has
a
good
taste
that
goes
with
the
style
worth
trying
there
is
slight
acidic
mouthfeel
and
the
finish
has
a
moderate
duration
overall
it
is
a
light
beer
with
some
flavor
d
drinkability
was
mediocre
unexciting
and
average
at
best
nothing
spectacular
or
worthy
of
future
purchases
d
easily
drinkable
goes
down
smooth
and
doesnt
linger
too
long
aroma
is
laced
with
spices
hops
and
malt
but
remains
mild
the
appearance
is
a
yellowish
white
color
with
serious
cloudiness
flavor
is
complex
with
a
light
citrus
flavor
along
with
the
obviously
present
coriander
the
wheat
and
yeast
also
are
very
obvious
the
hops
are
low
key
here
the
only
problem
with
this
ale
is
that
it
has
a
medicinal
taste
that
seriously
hurts
the
flavor
rating
still
its
a
good
beer
with
a
dry
finish
notes
from
o72405
this
beer
has
a
beany
and
wheat
flavor
infused
with
a
lot
of
citrus
but
not
overly
citric
it
has
a
beany
and
fruity
aroma
this
beer
has
a
great
golden
body
with
a
white
head
and
lace
there
is
some
carbonation
burn
it
its
light
body
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
great
beer
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
tasty
yes
overall
it
was
a
great
find
i
was
trying
to
find
something
i
had
never
had
before
this
was
pretty
nice
it
was
one
of
the
best
new
beers
i
had
in
a
long
time
it
was
a
little
more
expensive
than
i
would
have
liked
overall
this
one
is
definately
one
i
would
try
again
this
is
my
first
beer
report
the
excitement
of
opening
the
bottle
and
getting
a
good
whiff
was
quickly
brought
down
by
the
color
when
i
poured
it
i
has
a
great
citrus
aroma
nice
long
lasting
head
nice
lacing
pale
yellow
color
but
color
means
nothing
if
the
beer
tastes
great
you
can
taste
the
citrus
but
also
the
variety
of
spices
it
felt
watery
in
my
mouth
with
a
little
funny
after
taste
its
okay
but
im
not
inspired
to
buy
another
bottle
d
great
beer
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgianstyle

ive
had

a

overall
this
is

i
enjoyed
it
but
im
really
not
left
wanting
another
excellent
session
beer
a
real
thirstquencher
great
for
summer
time
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
yellow
body
with
a
thick
twofinger
head
that
died
quickly
and
left
a
lace
ring
a
citric
smell
permeates
with
some
sweet
wheat
odors
and
spices
but
nothing
overpowering
a
little
thin
for
my
liking
but
still
retains
a
good
lemon
peel
pop
with
some
corriander
and
is
a
little
fluffy
thanks
to
the
yeast
a
good
wit
but
a
little
underwhelming
this
beer
poured
out
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
fell
apart
very
quickly
minimal
retention
of
the
head
and
very
little
if
any
lacing
the
smell
is
what
you
would
expect
from
a
witbier
the
smell
of
yeast
with
a
floralcitrus
note
corriander
and
spices
also
a
slight
phenolic
character
again
the
taste
follows
suit
with
wheaty
breadlike
flavor
coated
with
spices
amd
a
tart
dry
finish
this
beer
has
a
fairly
thin
body
with
a
sparkling
carbonation
quality
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
much
middle
of
the
road
when
it
comes
to
the
witbier
sytle
better
than
blue
moon
close
to
leinenkugel
d
overall
this
is
an
alright
beer
as
i
said
not
the
greatest
of
witbiers
but
an
ok
example
d
very
drinkable
witbier
as
none
fo
the
flavors
are
overpowering
and
the
apricot
is
a
nice
touch
to
an
already
fruity
tasting
beer
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
but
then
again
im
an
avery
loyalist
a
murky
goldenyellow
pour
culminates
in
a
huge
white
head
that
rounds
off
above
the
rim
of
the
pilsner
head
is
bubbly
and
lasting
with
a
little
circle
of
lacing
left
behind
smells
of
lemon
coriander
wheat
a
bit
of
grass
and
yeast
tastes
spicy
and
somewhat
sweet
yet
its
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
lightbodied
drinker
that
seems
to
work
well
as
a
refreshing
recovery
drink
after
a
long
bike
ride
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
sized
white
head
that
fades
sharp
citrus
notes
in
the
aroma
with
orange
and
banana
coming
to
mind
with
some
yeast
zesty
citrus
flavor
consisting
of
lemons
orange
coriander
and
a
touch
of
banana
with
a
hint
of
spicy
hops
lightbodied
and
refreshing
but
not
watery
which
was
nice
not
belgian
good
but
a
pretty
good
beer
nonetheless
id
have
no
problem
having
this
again
on
a
warm
day
drinkability
is
high
i
love
this
style
of
beer
and
averys
is
clean
and
well
down
without
being
overspiced
well
done
easy
quaffing
brew
with
a
myriad
of
scents
and
flavors
around
the
next
turn
will
surely
try
again
more
than
worthy
in
my
book
pours
a
great
white
barely
colored
beer
with
great
head
and
lacing
especially
for
a
wheat
beer
it
has
a
great
aroma
very
malty
with
great
wheat
hints
and
a
nice
spiciness
a
little
clover
and
pepper
mostly
great
taste
very
nice
and
crisp
with
great
aftertastes
of
pepper
and
banana
it
goes
down
nice
if
a
little
rough
from
the
carbonation
drinkability
tasty
but
the
additional
spices
are
just
a
wee
bit
overbearing
for
me
like
oberon
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
by
a
u
s
brewer
certainly
one
to
use
to
turn
people
onto
witbiers
and
how
sad
is
it
that
hoegaarden
doesnt
even
taste
this
good
anymore
and
the
labelname
is
very
cool
overall
pretty
refreshing
but
the
fruit
flavors
were
a
bit
strong
and
dominated
the
beer
will
have
it
again
but
certainly
not
what
ill
be
reaching
for
first
smooth
and
mediumbodied
with
superb
drinkability
pours
a
pale
hazy
yellow
with
a
big
head
the
first
smell
is
of
citrus
then
yeast
this
is
full
bodied
wit
with
a
refreshing
citrus
note
on
the
finish
not
terribly
refined
or
complex
but
rather
flavourful
and
in
your
face
unlike
a
lot
of
watery
wits
da
nice
representation
of
this
catagory
nothing
eye
popping
but
definatly
a
nice
beer
avery
is
22
as
far
as
my
reviews
go
d
not
a
bad
witbier
probably
not
one
i
would
search
out
i
want
to
get
another
couple
bottles
to
try
to
taste
the
variances
if
i
pour
the
beer
the
way
they
say
and
the
normal
way
d
very
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
5
5
makes
it
not
bad
for
sessioning
and
goes
down
easy
especially
good
on
a
hot
day
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
thick
hazy
yellow
color
lots
of
bubble
rise
to
the
surface
not
a
ton
of
head
but
it
hangs
on
the
side
of
the
glass
nicely
theres
a
citrusy
yeasty
aroma
nice
texture
and
a
flavor
that
reflects
the
aroma
heavy
yeastycitrus
flavor
thats
typical
of
belgian
wheats
easy
to
drink
good
beer
too
expensive
though
i
think
i
went
to
a
ritzy
joint
to
buy
it
i
probably
could
have
gotten
for
about
three
bucks
cheaper
from
a
different
place
d
i
dont
know
why
but
i
really
liked
this
witbeir
hefecousin
it
was
refreshing
and
i
felt
better
than
the
reviews
show
maybe
it
was
the
batch
had
at
mollys
for
the
spainrussia
game
2nd
half
after
i
lost
my
cable
looks
like
pineapple
juice
is
decent
stuff
but
needs
more
complexity
medium
spritz
lightmedium
mouthfeel
mild
refreshing
flavour
it
took
me
4
years
to
try
this
but
probably
never
again
that
being
said
the
lowest
of
the
avery
lineup
d
very
drinkable
wit
beer
two
of
these
go
down
pretty
smooth
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
flying
saucer
here
in
nashville
while
this
beer
was
simple
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
evening
it
lacked
complexity
in
flavor
that
i
was
looking
for
and
have
found
in
other
wit
beers
it
was
offwhite
and
completely
cloudy
and
opaque
with
minimum
head
there
were
subtle
flavors
of
yeast
and
coriander
but
the
malt
and
hops
were
definitely
subdued
and
underrepresented
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
and
it
would
be
great
for
sessions
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
nice
solid
wit
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
sam
adams
special
glass
appearance
looks
like
lemonade
smells
wheaty
and
citrsy
not
overally
strong
taste
is
pretty
good
good
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
not
turn
one
down
but
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
one
witbier
is
no
my
fav
style
but
i
do
like
this
beer
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
good
lighter
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
especially
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
this
was
a
very
nice
drink
on
an
extrememly
hot
afternoon
d
not
bad
but
there
are
better
examples
not
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
not
one
of
averys
best
in
my
opinion
good
in
the
summer
time
tho
d
all
right
not
worth
seeking
out
but
it
is
descent
enough
to
try
if
you
stumble
across
it
d
one
or
two
is
ok
d
very
refreshing
this
could
easily
be
a
summer
session
beer
d
a
little
strong
on
the
coriander
and
unbalanced
but
still
not
a
bad
witbier
could
drink
a
few
but
probably
wouldnt
nothing
too
memorable
ok
drinability
wheat
beers
are
always
nice
on
a
hot
day
d
a
great
wit
all
and
all
by
avery
been
tasting
a
lot
of
wits
lately
this
is
top
notch
within
that
group
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
not
really
one
of
my
favorites
but
it
was
still
worth
trying
right
on
point
a
strong
american
example
of
style
a
pale
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
nose
has
lots
of
wheat
malts
with
a
strong
presence
of
coriander
clove
and
orange
a
little
overpowering
a
good
basic
wheat
but
the
spices
a
just
a
little
over
the
top
i
thinks
a
more
delicate
blend
woul
dbring
this
together
nicely

no

mouthfeel

with
a
lingering

and
light
to
medium
body
drinkability
on
this
one
is
high
this
is
my
first
time
having
it
and
i
like
it
more
than
hoegaarden
which
is
one
of
the
only
other
belgian
wits
that
ive
had
to
compare
it
to
give
this
one
a
shot
for
sure
d
very
drinkable
and
is
probably
best
on
a
nice
hot
day
soft
yeasty
wheat
with
banana
hint
of
spice
very
mild
clove
pretty
light
and
easy
to
drink
bit
of
citrus
and
definitely
doesnt
overdo
the
spice
moderate
medium
taste
for
the
style
d
pretty
damn
good
drinkability
is
huge
the
well
balanced
flavors
combined
with
a
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
make
this
one
that
you
could
enjoy
all
night
i
had
a
couple
6packs
of
this
beer
over
the
years
and
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
has
a
nice
light
citrusy
flavor
i
have
friends
who
are
not
beer
drinkers
say
that
they
enjoy
this
one
not
this
best
wit
ive
had
but
its
still
enjoyable
a
nice
enjoyable
wit
from
avery
makes
me
think
of
spring
which
is
just
around
the
corner
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
whiteyellow
color
ale
with
a
big
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
is
dominating
with
light
wheat
notes
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
orange
peel
coriander
and
some
wheat
malt
with
some
notes
of
fruity
ester
light
body
with
ok
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
there
with
the
best
from
the
style
color
is
a
pale
somewhat
cloudy
yellow
typical
of
a
wheat
beer
but
still
promising
aroma
is
strong
and
wheaty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
is
full
and
satisfying
wheaty
and
malty
no
bitterness
and
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
any
fan
of
wheat
beers
should
enjoy
this
one
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
is
a
very
pale
cloudy
yellow
a
twofingered
head
formed
upon
pouring
but
subsided
within
a
minute
to
a
thin
skin
of
white
foam
banana
and
clove
greet
the
nose
with
a
sugary
aroma
mouthfeel
is
smoother
than
expected
almost
creamy
controlled
pepperiness
comes
out
initially
malty
wheaty
flavor
spiked
with
a
faint
metallic
tang
yeast
in
the
midmouth
did
not
note
the
citrus
or
sourness
that
some
others
report
very
slight
note
of
astringency
and
a
subtle
bitterness
finish
off
the
palate
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
very
very
good
expected
the
carbonation
to
be
pretty
expressive
it
isnt
and
detracts
a
bit
from
the
otherwise
high
drinkability
score
just
doesnt
quite
quench
my
thirst
somehow
without
it
not
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
or
from
light
lawnmower
beers
but
im
sure
another
bottle
or
three
will
someday
make
it
into
my
glass
a
decent
effort
i
bought
this
beer
in
my
local
supermarket
in
bottle
form
the
a
head
quickly
dissipated
after
being
pured
into
a
5l
mug
the
color
was
a
light
yellow
where
as
the
smell
can
best
be
described
as
mix
of
citrus
and
wheat
the
taste
closely
follows
the
look
and
smell
of
the
beer
it
has
a
good
initial
impact
but
the
citruswheat
taste
leaves
a
weak
boring
flavor
one
of
its
most
positive
aspects
has
to
be
the
drinkable
its
a
beer
that
can
be
easily
enjoyed
without
filling
up
the
belly
too
much
maybe
best
for
a
cool
spring
or
fall
day
the
white
rascal
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
very
little
foam
head
the
aroma
is
coriander
and
orange
peel
the
taste
is
crisp
and
has
a
yeasty
flavor
to
it
that
is
spicy
on
the
finish
it
has
a
sour
taste
that
is
left
in
your
mouth
kind
of
lemony
with
bananas
it
is
a
pretty
decent
witbier
light
bodied
very
drinkable
shoulkd
be
an
excellent
warm
weather
brew
overall
witbiers
are
usually
hits
or
misses
this
one
offers
good
flavors
and
a
good
variety
well
worth
a
try

for

and
i
could
see
a

goingdoing
easy
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
cloudy
unfiltered
look
of

maybe
a
little
too
yellowchartreuse
average

scent
of

coriander

slight
hint
of

tangy
and
light
with
a
nice
spice
level
slightly
puckering
finish
slightly
dry
good
for
a
changeup
on
one
of
those
surprisingly
warm
days
of
winter
imagine
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
away
on
the
beach
overall
it
is
what
it
is
decent
mild
taste
very
drinkable
worthwhile
a
not
quite
clear
but
not
too
hazy
color
and
a
nice
balance
between
the
citrus
coriander
and
malt
in
the
scent
the
taste
also
equals
that
balance
too
a
slight
citrus
tang
but
not
too
much
a
bit
of
spice
but
not
too
much
with
a
clean
and
refreshing
yeasty
finish
d
decent
its
not
blanche
de
chambly
or
hoegaarden
and
just
lacks
body
and
seems
a
bit
thin
very
sessionable
and
worth
a
try
to
ease
someone
into
the
style
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
special
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
d
this
aint
bad
it
is
not
the
best
either
i
enjoy
the
taste
but
the
complexity
and
body
are
lacking
d
not
bad
but
this
seems
to
feeltaste
even
waterier
as
it
warms
nothing

i
am

that
i
was

able

find
two

the

took
away
from

for
me
i
dont

that
i

it
up
may
need
to
revisit
in

enjoyed
this
offering
from
avery
quite
a
bit
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
from
its
appearance
but
appearances
arent
everything
the
taste
and
nose
to
this
beer
were
quite
appealing
this
would
make
for
a
nice
some
hops
but
it
was
too
light
and
mild
would
guess
this
might
make
a
good
i
hate
wits
very
fresh
this
little
rascal
pours
a
dark
hazy
yellow
with
a
starting
white
head
of
about
3
fingers
the
head
dissipates
to
athin
layer
over
a
couple
of
minutes
but
does
its
job
of
lacing
the
glass
the
aroma
is
classic
lots
spice
and
yeast
notes
crowd
the
olafactory
network
and
sing
of
the
wheat
the
flavor
is
a
bit
less
classic
with
a
fairly
subdued
clove
sense
and
rather
nice
citrus
level
that
is
a
bit
atypical
for
the
style
nice
feel
continues
from
start
to
finish
with
less
dryness
start
sweet
and
tart
very
refreshing
and
tasty

citrus
and

a
taste
of
hops
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
search
it
out
my
wife
loves
it
though
c
witbiers
will
never
be
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
solid
version
of
one
nothing
crazy
or
outstanding
but
just
eminently
drinkable
and
tasty
o
a
nice
american
witbier
that
is
very
drinkable
and
great
in
the
summer
great
part
of
the
new
summer
mixed
12pack
this
and
summer
love
alone
make
the
pack
worth
picking
up
o
nothing
here
sets
the
world
on
fire
its
just
a
solid
witbier
thats
so
easy
to
kill
actually
its
a
bit
more
effortless
than
a
lot
of
other
wits
i
could
easily
down
two
or
three
bottles
of
this
on
a
hot
day
o
just
an
ok
take
on
the
style
there
are
no
serious
flaws
though
the
body
could
use
some
more
substance
it
just
comes
off
as
bland
a
very
middle
of
the
pack
offering
taste
more
like
hefe
than
wit
overall
one
of
the
better
witbiers
in
my
opinion
as
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
overly
funky
sour
belgian
beers
o
a
good
witbier
for
sure
here
way
better
than
i
was
expecting
even
for
a
company
as
well
respected
as
victory
the
orange
was
subdued
and
coriander
just
didnt
get
it
was
in
the
smell
but
wasnt
in
the
taste
which
probably
helped
this
beer
to
my
taste
nice
stab
at
a
style
that
is
my
least
favorite
wheat
style
beer
also
glad
it
smelled
like
green
apples
but
doesnt
taste
like
it
overall
this
could
have
been
a
truly
great
wheat
beer
but
the
chalkiness
in
the
mouthfeel
really
ruins
the
experience
i
wish
i
could
say
its
worth
trying
anyways
but
i
really
dont
think
it
is
really
a
shame

flavors
up

turning
yeasty
toward
the
end
finished
cleanly
with
a
light
bready
and
yeasty
aftertaste
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
overall
a
decent
wit
with
some
belgian
flavors
a
little
too
light
and
bland
for
its
own
good
a
think
a
little
more
hop
kick
and
more
floral
fruits
could
relaly
kick
this
up
a
notch
nice
to
drink
again
but
this
just
reminds
me
why
victory
maybe
stopped
making
this
annually
overall
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
aroma
here
things
are
kept
in
check
with
warmth
of
spice
and
heartiness
of
grain
these
are
lost
a
bit
through
the
flavor
however
with
things
lightening
up
a
touch
too
much
becoming
diluted
and
lost
amongst
the
wetness
of
the
wheatiness
the
spice
base
laid
down
through
the
aromatics
is
thus
lost
and
depreciated
otherwise
for
a
light
sipper
of
a
wit
this
guy
goes
back
smooth
ultimately
making
it
easy
to
appreciate
while
this
is
not
our
new
favorite
victory
offering
it
does
the
style
well
and
will
sit
against
most
of
its

enjoyable
o
a
good
thirst
quencher
for
a
very
hot
day
but
not
on
par
with
other
brews
from
victory
reminded
me
of
vedett
extra
white
minus
the
atmosphere
of
café
belga
in
ixelles
which
adds

to
any

pours

with
a
thin

that
leaves
minimal

some

the

lemon
wheat

the
taste
starts
out
with
some
lemon
wheat
yeast
and
follows
with
some
spices
and
finishes
off
with
more
lemon
and
some
grass
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
crisp
clean
smooth
feel
that
is
very
easy

drink
and
overall
this
is
a
nice
crisp
and
tasty
beer
that
is
nice
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
whenever
a
beer
this
good
sounds
good
overall
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
brewer
its
very
drinkable
bot
not
very
exciting
the
fruit
flavours
come
across
as
a
touch
artificial
too
nothing
worth
searching
for
overall
a
great
every
day
beer
must
try
o
not
a
bad
belgianstyle
wit
at
all
and
certainly
more
palatable
than
some
of
the
popular
macro
versions
out
there
the
5
abv
is
right
on
point
with
just
a
hint
of
american
bravado
in
the
malt
bill
and
herbal
hop
flavor
id
have
another
especially
on
a
scorcher
like
today
in
fact
overall
just
an
ok
wit
drinkable
but
lacks
something
in
the
belgian
spice
department
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
easy
to
drink
but
it
is
a
little
weak
seem
like
it
would
be
perfect
after
a
long
hot
summer
day
a
good
and
refreshing
beer
especially
if
its
hot
outside
overall
a
pretty
decent
wit
a
little
much
on
the
sweet
and
spicy
side
a
refreshing
beer
for
the
summer
but
thats
about
it
lots
of
others
in
the
same
category
overall
definitely
drinkable
and
refreshing
just
not
complex
enough
to
separate
it
from
others
in
the
genre
the
body
is
light
with
slightly
low
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
solid
the
aroma
could
be
better
but
we
can
put
this
one
the
list
of
goto
summer
brews
for
me
poured
a
small
12
white
head
but
it
had
decent
lifespan
the
body
is
a
hazy
raw
sienna
yellow
color
with
ample
tiny
bubbles
it
smells
mildly
of
malt
grain
and
citrus
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
but
adds
a
special
toastiness
to
the
malt
as
well
as
a
touch
of
sour
decent
finish
focusing
on
the
sour
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
somewhat
watery
yellow
coloring
with
a
steady
slow
flow
of
carbonation
and
a
slim
ring
of
white
film
around
the
edge
of
the
surface
aromas
of
toasted
grains
biscuits
and
a
slight
tangy
citrus
highlight
flavors
are
roasted
with
a
banana
and
clove
backbone
that
supports
the
smooth
creamy
body
a
slight
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
highlight
throughout
as
well
the
aftertaste
is
roasted
and
clove
spiced
with
a
smooth
creamy
finish
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
decent
flavor
profiles
make
this
a
great
summer
brew
that
is
a
bit
heavier
and
more
full
than
the
average
fare
tasty
overall
a
nice
change
of
pace
summer
drinker
sessionable
and
pleasant
o
wishing
more
vienna
malt
was
on
scene
i
am
glad
some
of
the
more
potent
witbier
spices
were
restrained
and
this
is
probably
a
blueribbonworthy
thristquencher
on
swampass
summer
days
but
it
was
a
bit
offensive
towards
the
end
they
say
life
gives
you
lemons
make
lemonade
same
i
think
might
begin
to
apply
to
victorys
whirlwind
wit
this
would
go
great
with
sugar
and
water
anyway
once
again
victory
comes
through
with
a
quality
brew
that
ill
look
forward
to
every
year
absolutely
an
ideal
belgianstyle
witbier
blue
moon
wishes
it
could
be
so
tasty
another
winner
from
victory
o
very
light
and
refreshing
a
delicious
beer
that
is
very
much
sessionable
the
beer
would
be
amazing
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
definitely
one
to
have
again
maybe
a
regular
in
the
summer
cookout
rotation
good
session
brew
while
sitting
and
drinking
outside
on
a
nice
warm
sunny
day
o
i
saw
this
beer
had
just
started
appearing
on
the
shelves
for
the
season
so
i
picked
one
up
fresh
the
appearance
and
smell
were
unimpressive
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
very
refreshing
it
is
a
very
sessionable
wit
that
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
pack
much
of
a
punch
it
wont
be
a
beer
i
turn
to
often
but
i
suppose
it
could
fill
a
tiny
witniche
in
my
repertoire
this
is
a
flavorful
balanced
witbier
i
really
enjoyed
it
wits
arent
a
favorite
of
mine
so
i
dont
often
get
into
them
but
i
would
have
this
one
again
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
a
wit
o
very
light
witbier
overall
tasty
but
not
overwhelming
oa
typical
witbier
tasty
but
nothing
godly
not
a
bad
investment
d
shoots
wide
of
the
signature
look
no
hazy
no
lace
and
a
touch
dark
taste
is
okay
if
a
bit
more
herbal
less
sweet
not
really
any
orange
peel
and
maybe
more
firmly
hoppy
than
most
mouthfeel
is
okay
if
a
bit
drier
belgian
yeast
aspect
is
rather
pedestrian
okay
drinking
but
not
really
a
go
to
wit
a
great
smelling
though
ultimately
dull
witbier
coriander
has
a
little
edge
to
it
here
i
also
am
still
getting
the
lemongrass
i
wonder
if
victory
uses
it
in
this
one
theres
also
a
blood
orange
citric
presence
that
is
cool
nice
balance
of
sweet
and
spice
neither
dry
nor
cloying
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
wit
and
this
one
is
one
of
the
best
new
ones
i
have
tried
in
quite
some
time
its
always
a
good
thing
if
my
beer
is
empty
before
i
can
finish
typing
my
thoughts
o
overall
whirlwind
wit
is
a
very
solid
wittier
that
is
very
quaffable
would
purchase
again
o
a
solid
beer
but
not
one
i
would
really
seek
out
this
is
one
of
victorys
weaker
attempts
and
this
is
my
favorite
brewery
light
bodied
with
great
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
strong
carbonation
causes
this
beer
to
literally
fizzle
away
in
your
mouth
luckily
the
strong
carbonation
does
not
seem
detrimental
to
the
flavors
drink
its
an
average
beer
with
its
place
in
the
market
for
a
good
summer
beer
to
cool
you
down
and
not
get
you
too
buzzed
a
little
lacking
in
flavor
but
oh
well
only
a
single
12
not
a
six
pack
the
wit
has
a
nice
flavor
of
belgian
yeast
with
some
slight
citrus
accents
it
seems
to
be
a
little
on
the
floral
side
with
the
hops
and
almost
soapy
with
a
creamy
wheat
flavor
in
the
middle
and
only
mildly
sweet
but
there
is
enough
peppery
and
lemony
quality
to
make
my
taste
buds
take
notice
overall
this
is
a
standard
wit
pretty
tasty
but
lacks
a
little
depth
in
the
malt
and
yeast
i
found
it
a
good
beer
to
go
with
orange
chicken
i
paired
it
with
excellent
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
medium
to
light
body
with
lots
of
flavor
oranges
and
wheat
malt
come
through
the
most
with
a
slight
taste
of
coriander
a
certain
sourness
and
tanginess
is
detected
leading
to
a
quick
and
clean
finish
and
dry
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
a
little
off
i
think
it
causes
a
weird
spritziness
that
distracts
me
from
the
taste
a
little
its
not
annoying
but
curious
and
interesting
overall
this
is
a
nice
summery
witbier
with
just
enough
tang
to
satisfy
those
taste
buds
and
enough
flavor
to
back
it
up
its
a
decent
brew
but
i
think
i
prefer
victorys
sunrise
to
this
one
o
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
im
glad
i
finally
broke
down
and
bought
some
of
this
d
quite
sessionable
easy
sipper
simple
straightforward
and
well
executed
not
my
favorite
witbier
and
not
my
favorite
victory
offering
but
it
will
do
just
fine
in
a
pinch
i
bought
7
bottles
of
beer
2
bottles
of
this
that
2nd
bottle
will
be
sitting
around
for
a
while
light
and
refreshing
with
some
very
pleasant
flavors
going
on
o
nothing
too
special
about
this
beer
only
thing
that
really
stands
out
is
my
constantly
wanting
more
from
the
beer
whether
it
be
flavor
or
smell
really
lacked
the
strong
yeast
characteristics
that
the
style
is
known
for
and
left
me
quite
bored
this
wit
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
yellow
color
its
got
a
fluffy
white
head
that
settles
into
just
a
thin
white
lacing
over
the
beer
the
smell
has
a
pretty
good
citrusy
and
spicy
aroma
the
taste
had
some
bready
yeast
along
with
the
citrus
from
the
nose
coming
in
on
the
flavor
the
spices
settle
into
place
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
refreshing
overall
its
a
pretty
good
wit
good
wit
beer
one
of
the
better
ive
sampled
looking
forward
to
more
after
this
one
moreys
bottom
line
a
fine
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
too
much
to
complain
about
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
could
see
myself
mixing
one
of
these
into
my
mix
and
match
sixers
once
in
a
while
especially
in
the
springsummer
o
man
is
this
sessionable
light
tasty
and
refreshing
the
whole
is
definitely
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
overall
an
excellent
brew
o
a
solid
witbier
look
forward
to
cracking
more
of
these
this
summer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
being
on
the
higher
side
overall
it
was
a
drinkable
beer
but
not
a
great
one
of
the
style
it
was
a
little
weak
overall
almost
feels
like
a
light
wit
beer
if
there
were
such
a
thing
or
a
light
beer
with
coriander
and
orange
peel
added
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
but
not
one
that
scores
great
against
its
peers
very
good
on
a
warm
spring
day
very
good
all
around
extremely
drinkable
and
sessionable
warm
weather
ale
had
this
sitting
out
in
the
sun
and
it
hit
the
spot
quenches
thirst
not
my
favorite
wit
ever
but
probably
up
there
on
the
list
and
i
would
have
this
again
the
second
beer
this
eveing
was
the
victory
worldwind
witbeir
the
color
was
a
cloudy
golden
with
thin
white
head
the
nose
included
hints
of
clove
and
citrus
the
taste
was
decent
was
not
overpowered
by
clove
or
citrus
very
good
balance
there
seemed
to
be
an
additional
spice
but
i
could
not
name
it
the
mouthfeel
was
good
enough
to
enjoy
victory
brewing
company
is
a
fantastic
brewery
that
routinely
brews
very
impressive
beer
whirlwind
witbier
is
definitely
impressive
generally
witbiers
are
relatively
simple
and
straight
forward
this
one
is
no
exception
but
the
flavor
is
really
nice
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
its
extremely
drinkable
and
you
have
a
winner
the
cpj
o
the
jury
is
still
out
whether
ill
get
this
one
again
i
guess
if
theres
nothing
else
around
at
the
time
ill
take
the
plunge
d
honestly
with
so
many
solid
brews
coming
out
of
victory
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
out
of
this
slightly
refreshing
but
definitely
better
examples
out
there
keep
on
moving
although
a
light
offering
this
beer
is
darn
good
very
easy
going
flavors
with
a
unique
profile
light
and
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
wins
all
the
time
t
pale
malts
yeast
clove
banana
and
lemon
meld
together
pretty
well
nice
light
mouthfeel
that
works
for
the
style
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
me
and
not
one
of
the
best
wits
ive
had
but
its
not
bad
at
all
o
this
was
picked
up
as
a
makeweight
to
a
case
of
prima
pils
and
im
glad
i
did
it
wont
change
the
world
but
its
a
perfectly
acceptable
summertime
beer
drinkable
but
pretty
forgettable
the
aroma
was
somewhat
light
but
once
you
let
it
warm
up
it
started
to
come
out
at
you
a
little
bit
better
very
nice
light
fruits
hints
of
banana
and
apricot
lots
of
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
really
far
in
the
back
with
a
touch
of
a
pepper
like
smell
as
well
the
flavor
followed
suit
just
the
same
with
a
very
nice
light
body
ale
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
really
crisp
clean
feeling
the
first
flavor
to
come
over
was
the
light
grain
and
a
touch
of
yeast
some
banana
poking
around
in
there
as
well
with
a
sparkling
quality
to
it
nice
touch
of
bitter
grapes
toward
the
finish
giving
that
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
touch
to
dry
out
the
finish
and
get
you
ready
for
another
sip
not
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
here
what
so
ever
as
this
was
really
solidly
put
together
i
could
have
kept
drinking
this
one
all
day
long
it
was
just
that
good
really
a
very
nice
high
quality
ale
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
pure
white
head
not
very
cloudy
even
after
making
sure
to
get
all
the
yeast
in
there
smell
is
of
belgian
spice
and
that
slightly
musty
aroma
that
comes
from
hoegaarden
taste
is
heavy
on
lemonlike
citrus
and
tastes
very
much
of
the
wheat
less
spicey
than
many
belgian
whites
its
almost
like
an
american
wheat
with
some
lemon
added
in
its
decent
but
nothing
spectacular
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
lots
of
suspended
yeast
visible
the
white
head
quickly
dissipated
to
nothing
and
only
scant
traces
of
lacing
remained
the
aroma
was
a
pleasing
blend
of
dry
wheat
light
spices
coriander
in
particular
hints
of
vanilla
and
traces
of
orange
peel
the
flavors
were
refreshing
and
very
similar
to
the
aroma
but
the
core
seemed
flat
balanced
and
appropriate
for
the
style
but
aside
from
the
distinct
coriander
on
the
finish
the
malt
and
the
hops
profiles
were
light
and
rather
uninspired
the
mouthfeel
was
good
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
fine
d
this
beer
goes
down
quickly
ill
buy
it
again
when
the
weather
becomes
more
conducive
to
witbier
enjoyment
orange
amber
with
visible
yeast
and
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
had
a
nice
aroma
of
banana
clove
and
bubble
gum
going
on
slightly
sweeter
taste
than
i
expected
with
a
nice
floral
nose
and
slight
citrus
taste
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
beer
probably
not
the
best
witbier
i
have
ever
has
but
pretty
tasty
and
affordable
overall
a
very
average
witbier
although
it
sure
is
a
refreshing
beer
i
found
it
too
light
bodied
this
definitely
needs
more
malt
more
spices
and
less
water
and
carbonation
slightly
hazy
and
golden
in
color
this
is
a
beer
that
just
looks
like
it
is
going
to
be
refreshing
the
first
taste
brings
a
bit
of
spice
coriander
with
hints
of
banana
lemongrass
clove
and
yeast
the
beer
finishes
with
a
tartness
that
just
calls
you
back
for
another
sip
another
glass
another
two
glasses
and
at
5
abv
this
is
a
beer
where
you
can
have
a
few
of
in
one
sitting
and
still
feel
fine
the
next
morning
the
flavor
is
so
light
and
refreshing
that
it
never
feels
heavy
on
your
stomach
the
carbonation
is
bubbly
and
pleasant
adding
to
the
overall
crispness
of
the
beer
easy
drinking
and
sessionable
but
theres
definitely
better
american
interpretations
of
the
style
not
too
refreshing
for
a
witbier
didnt
really
like
this
one
d
this
beer
is
light
and
goes
down
easily
it
simply
feels
too
thin
more
carbonation
and
would
help
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
drinkability
this
is
a
very
pleasing
witbier
victory
rarely
disappoints
me
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
i
have
thoroughly
enjoyed
consuming
it
now
if
only
it
were
available
in
six
packs
around
here
d
this
was
not
super
clean
and
tasty
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
easy
to
drink
but
boring
there
are
better
summer
beers
out
there
drinkability
this
beer
wont
kick
you
in
the
teeth
with
flavor
which
makes
it
pretty
sessionable
overall
an
okay
beer
not
impressive
by
any
standards
especially
for
a
victory
what
happened
victory
first
the
pils
then
this
one
hmmmm
maybe
there
is
some
funk
in
the
brewery
that
bothers
me
great
beer
for
a
humid
night
like
tonight
d
i
enjoyed
this
witbier
which
is
usually
not
my
favorite
style
the
spicy
yeast
character
won
me
over
and
i
would
have
another
drinkability
fairly
standard
wit
but
very
refreshing
while
definitely
good
i
had
expected
a
little
more
from
victory
very
drinkable
good
hot
summer
day
pours
a
nice
yellowish
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
has
very
nice
retention
but
no
lacing
to
speak
of
aroma
is
very
appealing
has
a
banana
clove
thing
going
on
with
some
lemon
peel
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
has
that
banana
flavor
very
smooth
really
an
easy
drinking
beer
overall
this
is
really
a
nice
beer
really
god
drinkability
on
this
one
a
great
summer
beer
especially
on
a
hot
humid
day
like
today
highly
recommended
served
from
tap
into
a
standard
pint
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
there
was
no
lacing
evident
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
wheat
and
bananas
the
flavor
was
of
bananas
and
had
a
wheat
bite
as
an
aftertaste
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
not
a
bad
witbier
needs
more
complex
flavors
to
be
the
greatest
of
its
type
but
it
does
pretty
well
with
what
it
has
currently
d
tasty
drink
something
you
can
consume
a
lot
of
in
the
summer
months
but
has
nothing
that
really
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
crowd
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
14
inch
head
of
a
white
color
poor
retention
and
poor
lacing
smells
of
lemon
slight
tart
malt
hint
of
hops
and
slight
sweet
malt
barely
fits
the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
the
feel
is
also
slightly
watery
tastes
of
lemon
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
overall
more
reminiscent
of
a
weissbier
than
a
witbier
this
wit
is
quite
refreshing
clovelike
yeast
flavors
are
most
dominant
carbonation
is
light
and
this
beer
finishes
pleasantly
dry
and
crisp
even
though
this
beer
is
built
around
the
yeast
it
avoids
the
phenolic
and
spicy
yeast
flavors
that
i
dislike
im
enjoying
this
one
among
the
better
domestic
wits
ill
be
pairing
this
up
with
some
grilled
chicken
and
salad
as
in
notgrilled
i
like
this
beer
i
have
become
partial
to
witbiers
lately
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
hot
day
or
for
when
lounging
and
you
want
something
simple
yet
enjoyable
dwith
the
beers
light
body
and
lower
level
of
carbonation
it
definately
is
drinkable
but
has
a
lackluster
quality
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wits
but
this
one
is
good
and
exceptionally
good
on
a
hot
june
afternoon
if
this
is
an
older
beer
as
others
in
this
batch
have
been
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
suffered
any
from
improper
storage
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fast
receding
head
with
a
brilliant
white
ring
smell
is
wheat
and
bread
with
coriander
and
citrus
peel
some
belgian
yeast
bananas
and
other
spices
the
taste
was
clean
and
crisp

followed
by
bananas
and
spices
mouth
feel
was
lightmedium
and
refreshing
on
this
warm

day
this
white
hit
the
spot
after
work
it
had
a
nice
belgian

very
refreshing
will
drink
again

whirlwind
witbier
was
a
light
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
dissipated
quickly
it
had
a
spicey
smell
to
it
it
has
a
light
taste
but
very
flavorful
there
was
alot
of
spices
and
some
hints
of
citrus
and
bananas
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
very
good
beer
a
very
different
beer
from
victory
one
of
the
better
summer
beers
out
there
pours
a
very
pale
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
that
of
wheat
backbone
with
hints
of
clove
and
a
little
banana
present
the
taste
is
good
nice
wheat
backbone
with
hints
of
clove
banana
and
maybe
some
citrus
the
taste
is
ever
so
slightly
watery
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
good
nothing
to
make
you
dislike
this
beer
the
taste
is
good
and
strong
a
nice
summer
beer
drinkability
despite
me
wanting
a
little
more
to
the
flavor
and
smell
its
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
mild
and
understated
perhaps
too
easy
to
drink
d
nice
crisp
summertime
beer
i
liked
the
way
this
tasted
all
together
there
was
a
ton
of
yeast
in
the
beer
which
i
could
have
done
without
overall
crisp
flavors
and
clean
tasting
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
beer
out
poured
into
the
evertrusty

got
2
fingers
of
head
from
an
aggressive
pour
smells
like
classic
witbier
coriander
belgian
yeast
corn
tortilla
flavor
is
kind
of
citrusy
flavorful
and
a
bit
of
the
aforementioned
corn
tortillaenchilada
refreshing
savory
great
example
of
style
d
easy
to
drink
great
beer
for
warm
weather
springsummer
refreshment
at
its
finest
pours
a
very
nice
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
good
amount
of
white
foam
on
top
aromas
of
wheat
lemon
and
orange
zest
flavors
here
are
very
similar
to
the
aromas
with
the
citrusy
flavors
balancing
nicely
with
the
belgian
yeasts
a
very
good
refreshing
summer
beer
an
excellent
white
beer
d
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
its
a
good
choice
for
relaxing
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
ridiculously
drinkable
its
got
a
very
nice
flavor
and
doesnt
overwhelm
you
or
bog
you
down
at
all
when
youre
drinking
it
drinkability
a
good
summer
beer
and
is
a
good
way
for
your
friends
to
kick
that
stupid
blue
moon
trend
this
is
one
beer
that
you
dont
need
an
orange
slice
in
d
a
witbier
thats
more
lively
than
most
which
makes
up
for
the
average
taste
and
atrocious
appearance
id
definitely
reach
for
this
again
on
a
hot
summar
day
but
i
really
hope
it
looks
a
bit
better
next
time
ie
no
floaties
d
it
has
a
good
drinkability
factor
not
as
much
sweetness
as
most
of
the
style
whirlwind
strikes
me
as
a
really
nice
thirst
quencher
for
a
warm
spring
or
summer
day
or
a
backyard
barbecue
it
is
bright
light
in
body
not
overly
sweet
and
a
bit
tart
nice
qualities
for
the
season
d
i
may
have
to
have
this
again
since
i
lost
the
bottle
for
my
label
collection
but
i
enjoyed
this
just
as
much
as
other
offerings
by
victory
go
golden
monkey
pretty
yellow
dits
a
thirst
quencher
great
beer
for
anyone
looking
for
a
summer
beer
for
bbqs
etc
although
probably
my
least
favorite
offering
from
victory
that
ive
tried
i
prefer
hefeweizen
styles
over
witibier
although
they
are
quite
similar
the
lack
of
head
and
lacing
was
a
little
disappointing
between
this
or
sam
adams
summer
ale
id
choose
this
every
time
d
not
the
best
wit
but
pretty
nicely
done
light
and
very
easy
to
put
down
highly
drinkable
hazy
golden
with
plenty
of
yeast
in
suspension
but
disappointingly
little
head
and
not
the
best
lacing
i
am
a
big
fan
of
wit
beers
in
the
springsummer
but
the
aroma
on
this
let
me
down
a
little
with
much
more
prominent
clove
character
than
i
usually
prefer
citrus
and
wheat
malt
were
also
there
but
the
clove
seemed
to
jump
out
the
most
to
me
the
flavor
was
better
still
plenty
of
clove
but
a
lot
more
white
pepper
and
other
spices
joined
up
with
wheat
malt
sweetness
and
orange
peel
notes
medium
body
with
slightly
spiky
carbonation
and
a
nice
clean
slightly
tart
finish
a
drinkable
beer
to
be
sure
but
not
my
favorite
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
overall
very
good
its
almost
as
good
as
the
one
from
maine
and
that
is
pretty
amazing
in
itself
however
its
priced
similarly
at
least
where
i
buy
my
beer
so
although
this
is
very
competitive
it
is
not
a
winner
this
is
a
lightbodied
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
not
a
great
coldweather
beer
but
nice
for
warm
temperatures
a
rare
disappointment
from
victory
this
could
be
old
or
something
as
it
is
i
wont
be
going
back
for
this
one
md
very
easy
to
drink
too
easy
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and

freshness

on
the
bottle
poured
yellowish
orange
with
a
thick

foamy
head
that
quickly
disappears
the
aroma
had
yeast
grasslike
with
lemon
citrus
notes
strong
spice
pepperlike
clove
fruity
flavors
the
taste
of
banana
blend
nicely
with
yeast
orange
and
lemon
citrus
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
very
light
making
this
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
first
tried
this
at
a
brewfest
then
i
purchased
a
number
of
bottles
very
tasty
indeed
notes
not
the
best
witbier
ive
had
but
something
a
little
different
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
some
of
the
feel
but
it
feels
delicate
it
is
more
refreshing
than
flavorful
but
serves
its
purpose
nicely
into
a
hoegaarden
glass
poured
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
finger
of
bright
white
head
that
collapsed
quickly
and
laced
spottily
the
smell
in
a
word
was
mild
standard
clove
and
lemon
but
not
very
complex
the
flavor
confirmed
this
certainly
needs
more
flavor
strength
the
feel
was
light
but
somewhat
watery
certainly
light
enough
to
session
but
needs
more
flavor
and
complexity
d
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
based
on
the
company
and
i
tend
to
like
most
wits
this
one
was
a
good
though
not
great
beer
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
another
but
its
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
its
very
refreshing
and
yet
a
very
simple
wit
the
simplicity
of
the
beer
has
its
benefits
and
drawbacks
depending
on
the
drinker
and
the
situation
but
another
victory
beer
i
can
feel
comfortable
calling
quality
whirlwind
witbier
may
not
be
victorys
most
impressive
beer
but
its
a
rocksolid
example
of
the
style
and
is
as
drinkable
as
a
midsummer
day
is
long
there
arent
many
american
wits
better
than
this
d
full
flavored
wit
maybe
a
little
too
flavorful
for
long
sessions
notes
victory
is
simply
a
solid
brewery
probably
one
of
my
top
5
favorites
overallnice
balanced
wit
with
good
flavor
recommended
pours
a
cloudy
golden
lots
of
suspended
sediment
and
no
head
smells
a
nice
fruity
maltiness
sensing
perhaps
a
bit
of
peach
or
apricot
its
got
a
solid
medium
body
i
enjoyed
the
flavor
very
muchslightly
fruity
and
spicy
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
would
definitely
have
it
again
it
was
very
drinkable
and
a
great
summer
brew
notes
feels
like
a
nice
version
of
the
wheat
beers
true
to
the
spirit
and
very
drinkable
and
shareable
in
fact
it
is
a
good
beer
that
probably
does
not
need
or
sustain
much
thinking
or
detailed
recommendation
to
offer
it
drinkability
a
good
beer
for
summer
drinking
and
easy
to
have
another
when
out
for
dinner
and
an
evening
of
good
conversation
this
is
not
the
best
wit
ive
had
but
it
is
a
well
made
tasty
one
that
is
worth
trying
and
drinking
its
a
good
brew
but
lacking
punch
it
could
really
use
a
slice
of
orange
which
for
me
says
its
missing
a
bit
of
flavor
but
perfect
for
a
hot
day
on
the
deck
hazy
bleach
blonde
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
lace
behind
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
fruity
lemon
and
orange
zest
with
overripe
banana
come
to
mind
with
a
nice
whiff
of
wheat
malt
and
coriander
belgian
tasting
yeast
and
spice
combine
with
citrus
fruit
flavors
nicely
smooth
and
medium
light
bodied
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
nothing
amazing
here
just
a
nice
witbier
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
wheat
cloves
citrus
a
lot
going
on
here
tastes
like
it
smells
a
lot
of
different
flavors
combining
to
a
quite
delicious
tasting
ber
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
very
smooth
i
would
definatly
recommend
this
beer
dont
drink
and
review
appearance
is
a
very
clear
yellow
sort
of
just
average
nothing
bad
but
nothing
too
appealing
smells
quite
citrusy
but
the
overall
aroma
is
fairly
light
orange
peel
and
lemon
are
there
with
just
a
hint
of
spice
tastes
like
standard
wit
ingredients
citrus
corienader
spice
very
clean
and
light
mouth
is
lightbodied
not
watery
though
and
has
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
its
a
good
easy
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
sip
in
the
heat
at
a
bbq
or
such
d
summer
beer
for
sure
and
easy
to
drink
a
few
and
not
be
tired
of
the
flavors
medium
body
somewhat
heavier
and
thicker
than
i
like
my
wits
good
carbonation
this
is
easy
to
drink
but
just
above
average
in
my
opinion
very
drinkable
but
almost
too
delicate
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
depth
to
this
d
very
enjoyable
especially
on
a
hot
day
i
could
drink
this
all
day
easily
and
be
quite
happy
very
refreshing
d
just
average
in
my
opinion
but
extremely
drinkable
no
flavors
lean
to
far
to
one
side
and
nothing
really
stands
out
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
great
session
beer
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
and
this
a
favorite
style
of
mine
that
says
something
starts
off
with
zesty
leomon
and
orange
mixed
together
with
a
spoon
of
spice
the
taste
left
a
bit
more
to
be
desired
felt
like
watered
down
citrus
still
felt
good
with
a
medium
body
and
some
carbonation
to
leave
me
refreshed
high
drinkability
easy
flowing
pours
a
hazy
light
golden
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
in
short
order
quite
lemony
in
the
aroma
with
some
coriander
and
even
a
little
bit
of
grapefruit
juice
taste
is
similar
medium
bodied
for
the
style
crisp
and
zingy
with
lemon
white
grapefruit
juice
and
some
tangy
herbalness
pretty
refreshing
if
a
bit
simple
still
the
zestiness
of
this
one
satisfies
nicely
on
a
hot
day
overall
definitely
not
the
best
rendition
of
the
witbier
style
but
it
holds
its
own
i
will
definitely
finish
this
six
pack
but
i
dont
think
id
get
another
especially
since
i
can
find
allagash
white
in
my
area
now
drinkability
is
pretty
damn
high
thanks
to
the
abv
but

for
a

asking

kind
of

good
beer
this
is
certainly
not
a
very
complex
beer
but
it
is
exceptionally
drinkable
its
tough
to
put
the
glass
down
which
is
the
key
determining
factor
of
a
great
session
beer
in
my
eyes
overall
a
middle
of
the
pack
witbier
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
just
because
i
know
there
are
better
options
drinkability
a
revitalizing
refreshing
witbier
that
positively
makes
you
want
to
leap
out
of
your
seat
with
a
renewed
burst
of
energy
to
go
find
your
server
and
order
another
beer
it
makes
a
tradeoff
for
less
body
and
overall
flavor
for
an
added
bonus
in
ease
of
drinking
and
refreshment
rather
enjoyable
spicy
in
the
aroma
slightly
sweet
in
the
flavor
all
around
a
good
beer
recommended
cheers
i
would
actually
rate
this
higher
than
a
lot
of
people
in
that
im
in
a
belgianphase
right
now
and
may
have
rosecolored
glasses
my
first
witbier
i
thought
that
even
though
the
mouthfeel
was
flat
this
witbier
had
a
unique
taste
which
intrigued
me
i
could
very
well
see
myself
ordering
a
few
this
is
what
you
expect
from
a
brewery
effecting
a
belgianstyle
wit
rather
than
the
way
its
been
americanized
a
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
with
a
low
abv
if
your
are
a
fan
of
the
style
surely
try
this
d
a
very
drinkable
witbier
its
quality
try
it
pours
somewhat
of
a
golden
color
clearer
than
i
expected
the
yeast
doesnt
cloud
the
beer
like
some
witbiers
i
have
had
tastes
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
tad
bit
of
spiciness
the
beer
is
a
little
too
carbonated
in
my
opinion
but
it
doesnt
take
much
away
overall
a
great
summer
beer
and
thirst
quencher
excellent
drinkability
dry
lightly
sweet
and
tart
at
the
same
time
with
a
delicate
spice
in
the
finish
well
done
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
with
some
good
attributes
but
there
are
definitely
better
examples
of
of
the
style
out
there
d
a
drinkable
and
quality
wit
but
a
bit
hohum
a
12
ounce
bottle
poured
into
my
shaker
glass
appears
a
cloudy
bright
yellow
color
with
two
fingers
of
fluffy
bone
white
foam
the
head
leaves
little
to
no
lacing
smells
and
tastes
of
lemon
orange
a
hint
of
cloves
slightly
spicy
yeast
and
some
bready
wheaty
grains
this
witbier
is
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
quite
quenching
d
a
drinkable
wit
at
a
low
abv5
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
some
warm
weather
good
flavor
from
a
local
company
good
enough
for
a
return
not
a
paragon
of
the
style
probably
although
this
is
the
first
witbier
ive
had
in
a
long
time
and
so
i
cant
really
judge
it
on
that
its
not
supercomplex
didnt
really
open
up
new
notes
as
i
was
drinking
but
top
marks
for
thirstquenching
would
drink
again
and
good
for
the
price
overall
not
bad
but
would
not
want
more
than
one
of
these
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
sort
of
like
an
exwife
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smell
was
very
light
yet
quite
clean
and
crisp
also
earthy
notes
taste
was
fairly
light
but
very
earthy
and
grassy
similar
to
a
smoother
macro
with
minimal
carbonation
nothing
too
special
just
a
very
clean
beer
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
not
complex
at
all
good
to
try
if
you
like
belgian
witbier
highly
drinkable
whirlwind
is
sweetly
grainy
mild
and
dry
and
the
combination
makes
a
great
beverage
d
not
bad
i
could
easily
have
a
view
of
these
the
only
thing
that
would
hold
me
back
would
be
the
excessive
spicing
then
again
i
dont
drink
wits
all
that
often
so
it
might
be
that
i
just
need
to
be
reacquainted
with
the
spice
character
i
picked
up
a
single
for
2
to
give
it
a
whirlha
i
guess
not
bad
but
in
my
opinion
it
doesnt
stack
up
to
hoegaarden
pours
a
very
thin
white
head
that
barely
sticks
around
long
enough
to
be
called
a
head
no
lacing
as
one
would
thus
expect
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
the
orange
to
lemon
citrus
not
really
taking
its

maybe
a
suggestion
of

poured

a

nice

a
mild
witbier
that
is
not
quite
able
to
support
the
level
of
coriander
spicing
the
light
flavors
of
wheat
and
citrus
are
nice
but
a
bit
underwhelming
a
hint
of
the
diacetyl
that
seems
common
in
boston
beer
offerings
but
at
a
level
that
add
a
pleasant
mellowing
component
to
this
as
is
usually
the
case
id
probably
go
for
a
more
traditional
witbier
in
the
future
but
this
was
easy
and
light
and
worked
well
for
a
warm
afternoon
i
like
sam
adams
but
this
is
probably
one
of
their
more
boring
beers
very
mild
with
a
hint
of
a
spicy
finish
a
nice
beer
for
someone
starting
to
lean
away
from
buds
and
millers
very
similar
to
shock
top
imo
blue
moon
is
better
than
this
one
of
the
best
from
sam
adams
great
early
spring
beer
one
of
my
favorites
for
drinking
after
getting
my
lawn
ready
for
spring
this
beer
is
good
worth
a
try
serving
type
bottle
i
love
sam
adams
but
this
is
marketed
toward
blue
mooners
alpine

to
make

looks
hazy
awe
unless
with
a
thin
creamy
head
smells
of
spice
and
vanilla
cinnamon
taste
oh
no
not
too
bad
actually
pretty
good
tastes
of
a
lager
with
a
warmer
vanilla
finish
i
like
i
could
drink
many
of
these
very
smooth
overall
acceptable
freshness
and
interesting
craft
very
flavorful
but
unbalanced
having
overwhelming
citrus
could
easily
be
called
an
orange
beer
making
this
a
bit
hard
to
drink
while
eating
for
a
white
beer
definitely
a
very
very
average
maybe
even
below
average
beer
o
i
dont
really
get
it
but
i
hear
this
beer
sells
really
well
for
me
it
was
just
another
average
wheat
beer
not
worth
seeking
out
again
an
ok
attempt
but
now
wow
factor
and
not
one
to
seek
out
its
what
you
would
expect
from
sam
adams
an
above
average
brew
that
just
can
not
compete
with
the
quality
of
the
micro
brewers
it
likely
inspired
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
goes
in
hazy
yellow
with
an
unfiltered
look
no

one

pale
white
head
quickly
fades
to
a
thin
cap
with
virtually
no

and
spices
evident
in
the
mouth
malty
backbone
balanced
against
moderate
hops
hints
of
lemon
mouth
is
a
bit
fizzy
but
quenching
and
decent
overall
really
this
tastes
like
a
spiced
sam
adams
boston
lager
to
me
nothing
remarkable
it
wasnt
horrible
but
ill
still
say
nothing
to
see
here
on
taprather
bland
and
boring
seasonal
option
at
red
lobster
to
put
it
kindly
i
should
have
ordered
the
cola
on
draft
not
sure
if
it
was
a
bad
batch
but
this
was
a
huge
diacetyl
bomb
a
huge
amount
of
butter
in
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
couldnt
take
more
than
one
sip
o
after
a
few
years
of
only
having
boston
lager
winter
lager
and
latitude
48
available
two
additional
sam
adams
beers
became
available
in
new
brunswick
cold
snap
and
rebel
ipa
so
far
ive
only
had
this
one
cold
snap
and
i
have
to
stay
that
im
fairly
happy
its
now
available
in
my
area
it
offers
a
refreshing
taste
that
has
a
good
spiciness
to
it
although
maybe
too
much
coriander
and
if
oyure
looking
for
a
good
witbier
this
is
much
better
than
hoegaarden
ok
but
not
my
type
of
brew
i
am
not
a
fan
the
combination
of
flavors
do
not
go
down
well
the
spices
are
the
downfall
here
over
done
good
beer
try
the
winter
lager
not
for
me
medium
light
bodied
crisp
was
refreshing
atleast
not
a
big
sam
adams
fan
usually
but
i
like
this
beer
has
a
great
look
with
good
head
that
unfortunately
doesnt
last
long
enough
flavors
are
nice
and
balanced
smell
is

been
a

very

this

will
remind

the

might
be

of
it

this
one
is

love
this
beer

a

beer
with
a
nice
hint
of
summer
in
it
pale
orange
with
a
slightly
citrus
aroma
but
i
might
be
reaching
figured
i
would
at
least
get
some
coriander
somewhere
in
this
one
but
no
go
goes
down
easily
though
if
thats
saying
anything
this
taste
like
an
upgrade
to
blue
moon
nothing
snappy
about
it
i
never
thought
the
words
blue
moon
tastes
better
would
ever
come
out
of
my
mouth
cold
snap
is
a
decent
attempt
at
a
witbier
although
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
warmer
weather
to
come
and
that
most
certainly
is
a
good
thing
i
think
i
might
enjoy
it
more
when
the
temperature
stays
above
freezing
gets
way
too
sweet
at
the
end
perfect
first
couple
drinks
bummer
sweet
overly
carbed
no

no

not
my
favorite

beer
o
id
stick
with
the
boston
lager
before
i
picked
this
one
out
again
there
are
plenty
of
witbiers
and
plenty
of

just
with

i
was
looking
for
more
of
a

taste
without
the
risk
of
it
being
a
shandy

would

nothing

but
not
all
that
memorable
some
scent
of
citrus
and
spice
scent
doesnt
carry
over
much
to
the
flavor
tastes
like
a
regular
wheat
beer
ok
except
for
a
little
soapy
taste
on
the
finish
meh
overall
murky
not
in
a
typical
wheat
way
but
swamp

unfortunately
swamp
watervwould
be
thicker
in
mouthfeel
very
thin
it
also
has
a
very
funky
fake
flavoring
not
at
all
something
ill
get
again
very
much
a
belgian
wheat
it
is
reminiscent
of
a
cross
between

c
good
representation
of
the

definitely
better
witbiers
out
there
but
this
is
a
very
nice
drinking
experience
o
the
artificial
character
of
the
citrus
was
off
putting
poured
from
bottle
in
pint
glass
golden
haze
appearance
with
two
fingers
of
active
soapy
head
that
dissolves
at
a
steady
pace
a
white
solid
cap
is
left
behind
with
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
biscuit
taste
of
funky
citrus
some
malt
some
spice
almost
a
peppery
shandy
extremely
smooth
mouthfeel
no
alcohol
burn
slippery
average
witbeir
would
be
good
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
while
grilling
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
its
just
got
an
odd
overspiced
taste
to
it
leaves
a
weird
taste
on
the
finish
took
two
sips
and
handed
it
back
im
all
set
for
sure
terrible
its
just
a
watered
down
lemonade
i
hate
almost
all
winter
brews
but
this
this
is
great
its
almost
like
a
belgian
with
coriander
only
with
some
caramel
pepper
and
cinnamon
so
its
not
to
dark
but
not
light
either
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
seasonal
from
sam
adams
it
should
probably
be
around
all
year
o
not
bad
but
not
good
slightly
below
average
but
much
better
than
blue
moon
sour
flat
no
head
cloudy
dont
do
it
to
yourself
this
is
very
similar
to
a
blue
moon
except
i
found
it
to
be
less
sweet
with
more
of
a
metallic
taste
an
easy
drink
that
makes
me
long
for
the
spring
good
witbier
not
the
best
but
definitely
a
one
of
the
better
attempts
by
a
large
brewery
not
a
bad
beer
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
drank
out
of
the
bottle
at
a
work
function
due
to
nothing
else
and
wasnt
overly
impressed
for
a
big
brewery
this
one
is
really
solid
easydrinking
beer
very
typical
of
the
style
refreshing
and
easily
sessionable
nothing
exceptional
a
very
good
spring
beer
this
beer
is
fuckin
weird
and
not
in
a
good
way
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
the
spices
blend
well
and
a
nice
touch
of
orange
i
would
drink
it
again
a
cloudy
beer
on
tap
reminding
me
of
a
less
sweet
blue
moon
just
ok
in
my
opinion
restoring
my
interest
in
witbiers
the
creamy
but
crisp
feel
surprised
me
if
you
like
hefeweizens
and
white
ales
you
will
like
this
seasonal
beer
much
better
than
sam
adams
other
spring
seasonal
attempts
easy
to
drink
clean
and
crisp
eh
sweaty
gatorade
comes
to
mind
overall
the
easy
drinking
nature
of
this
beer
makes
it
worth
a
purchase
again
it
is
not
the
most
flavorful
beer
but
you
can
drink
it
like
a
budweiser
and
its
leagues
better
nicely
done
and
unique
overall
an
acceptable
witbier
slightly
above
average
but
not
stellar
i
would
order
it
again
if
i
have
no
other
good
draught
options
gold
cloudy
look
light
beer
taste
not
impressed
had
on
tap
at
a
nearby
bowling
alley
nice
witbier
does
not
feel
like
it
is
your
typical
wide
release
beer
looks
like
your
average
witbier
with
some
nice
lacing
throughout
smells
ok
no
distinction
your
typical
citrus
for
style
i
like
the
taste
its
not
too
citrusy
at
all
which
i
like
i
may
not
seek
it
out
but
will
be
a
go
to
at
this
particular
spot
moving
forward
m
a
bit
full
bodied
for
a
wheat
well
carbonated
poured
in
to
a
pint
glass
a
marshmallowlike
crown
of
finely
carbonated
foam
graces
the
hazy
honeygolden
ale
before
briskly
receding
to
a
one
finger
head
thin
lacing
remains
as
the
only
sign
of
that
remarkable
white
cap
excellent
retention
the
aroma
promises
sweet
citrus
orange
and
ripe
purple
plum
the
first
sip
brings
a
bready
sweet
malt
backbone
with
a
balanced
orange
peel
zest
the
moderate
spicing
accentuates
the
citrus
notes
and
gives
it
a
peppery
punch
theres
a
nice
grassy
wheat
flavor
that
permeates
the
whole
experience
fairly
clean
finish
as
the
balance
of
flavors
restrain
any
one
of
the
elements
from
becoming
too
dominant
the
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
watery
with
tame
carbonation
making
it
extremely
easy
to
gulp
refreshing
and
satisfying
a
touch
basic
but
delicious
nonetheless
for
a
massmarketed
seasonal
american
witbier
it
stands
above
its
contemporaries
it
lacks
the
nearcloying
sweetness
of
blue
moon
and
the
off
aftertaste
it
steers
clear
of
the
adjunct
flavors
that
creep
in
to
shocktop
and
has
more
nuance
than
the
fruity
pebbles
flavors
of
sunset
wheat
i
enjoy
all
of
the
aforementioned
beers
to
one
degree
or
another
but
cold
snap
is
definitely
a
step
above
in
my
mind
its
no
allagash
white
but
its
pretty
damn
tasty
pours
with
little
head
and
shows
cloudy
pale
amber
in
the
glass
nose
has
some
very
light
spice
notes
lightly
carbonated
and
tastes
a
bit
thin
but
with
light
orange
and
spice
flavor
like
a
slightly
watered
down
creamcicle
with
a
bit
of
a
yeast
kicker
wouldnt
drink
a
bunch
of
these
but
refreshing
and
enjoyable
overall
a
pretty
decent
white
ale
and
worth
getting
at
least
once
it
most
certainly
isnt
allagash
but
it
does
offer
an
interesting
variation
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
wasnt
crazy
about
it
either
i
guess
im
not
much
of
a
hefe
fan
it
was
a
little
too
fruity
kinda
reminded
me
of
watered
down
mt
dew
with
some
orange
juice
mixed
in
wheaty
lemony
orangey
and
uninspired
eric
very
crisp
with
a
small
late
bitterness
overall
i
would
recommend
it
to
a
friend
o
not
a
bad
take
on
a
witbier
if
a
bit
less
complex
than
id
prefer
great
beer
great
taste
and
body
love
the
citrus
and
non
filtered
look
fine
example
of
a
wit
citrusy
grapefruit
taste
not
my
favorite
winter
beer
but
will
do
in
a
pinch
got
from
draft
i
normally
like
sam
adams
stuff
pretty
well
but
i
dont
care
for
this
one
just
blah
all
the
way
around
beer
looked
beautiful
and
i
was
excited
to
try
it
after
a
recommendation
from
a
friend
after
every
sip
i
kept
tasting
an
overpowered
spice
reminding
me
of
the
flavor
of
root
beer
really
did
not
enjoy
this
one
cloudy
yolk
fine
pillowy
foam
strong
bread
grains
of
paradise
burnt
orange
light
citrus
front
with
a
bready
finish
not
bad
another
one
of
my
favs
snap
wish
it
was
available
all
winter
in
restaurants
nice
smooth
feel
no
distinctive
spice
taste
sdefinitely
wheat
beer
with
a
strong
citrus
scent
mostly
orange
coriander
i
also
picked
some
spices
but
couldnt
put
a
finger
on
any
dominant
one
tsurprisingly
good
wasnt
ground
breaking
but
a
pretty
decent
interpretation
on
the
style
i
found
it
to
be
refreshingly
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
somehow
this
screamed
summer
to
me
not
winter
i
enjoyed
this
and
am
glad
i
purchased
a
six
pack
because
they
are
so
easy
to
drink
solid
easy
drinking
wit
beer
orange
peel
and
plum
work
nicely
not
horrible
but
a
strange
choice
to
me
for
a
winter
beer
this
one
is
growing
on
me
after
an
initial
negative
reaction
gained
a
new
respect
for
it
after
drinking
a
couple
of
harpoon
ipas
beforehand
i
expected
the
cold
snap
to
be
nearly
tasteless
and
overly
sweet
after
that
but
it
held
its
own
obviously
a
very
different
beer
than
an
ipa
but
it
shone
through
for
what
it
is
a
decent
although
certainly
not
top
notch
witbier
there
is
a
time
place
and
mood
for
this
beer
for
me
anyway
and
it
fulfills
its
purpose
respectably
enough
definitely
dont
mind
having
a
few
kicking
around
in
the
fridge
for
when
the
mood
strikes
great
tasting
beer
but
best
not
to
drink
too
much
as
it
quickly
wears
on
you
great
for
a
pint
or
two
with
lunch
this
product
is
like
most
sam
adams
products
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
spices
malts
some
citrus
taste
is
smooth
and
refreshing
citrus
malts
wheat
spices
very
easy
drinking
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
excellent
take
on
a
white
ale
i
still
miss
sam
adams
white
ale
but
this
is
a
great
replacement
i
actually
thought
this
one
wasnt
to
bad
a
decent
witbier
interpretation
too
many
spices
and
crap
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
wit
it
had
lots
of
yeast
and
wheat
flavors
which
i
liked
its
typical
of
the
style
and
enjoyable
not
great
a
bit
flavorless
just
okay
but
a
tad
better
my
2nd
favorite

before

a
friend
gave
me
a
bottle
recently
so
i
wasnt
able
to
try
it
when
it
was
fresher
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
half
inch
white
head
heaed
retention
is
decent
enough
and
there
isnt
much
lacing
the
brew
smells
like
orange

and
a
bit
of
bubblegum
it
tastes

a

its

i
think
its
an
ok
brew
overall
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
but
i
wouldnt
make
a
point
to
seek
it
out
either
with
that
being
said
i
would
like
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
in
the

a
b
cold
snap
is
definitely
one
of
my
favourite
samuel
adams
beers
yet
and
certainly
one
of
the
better
witbiers
available
in
ontario
at
the
moment
this
is
a
tasty
thirstquenching
brew
that
id
happily
drink
again
or
recommend
to
anyone
who
happens
to
be
interested
in
the
style

with

coriander

overall
a
good
spring
beer
better
than
recent
ones
im
looking
at
you
alpine
spring
this
beer
was
a
suggestion
of
a
friends
while
getting
steaks
when
it
came
out
it
had
a
hazy
look
in
the
glass
similar
to
blue
moon
but
not
as
bright
it
had
a
decent
smell
not
as
hoppy
as
other
sam
adams
spring
brews
to
be
it
was
average
in
taste
i
would
not
shy
away
from
it
in
the
future
it
is
a
good
standby
beer
but
if
i
have
some
else
to
choose
i
will
go
with
something
else
this
beer
is
better
than
the
larger
brands
but
compares
well
with
other
craft
beers
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
with
steak
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
in
that
the
sweet
malt
backing
is
the
most
dominate
aspect
mild
spicing
of
coriander
and
a
slight
yeasty
character
carbonation
is
adequate
although
lower
than
it
should
be
finishes
semisweet
but
not
sticky
or
cloying
just
not
as
dry
as
it
could
be
overall
to
me
this
is
just
the
same
spiced
ale
the
has
been
repackaged
how
many
times
will
samuel
adams
keep
doing
this
o
i
was
excited
to
see
this
come
out
figured
it
was
a
revival
of
sam
adams
white
but
it
falls
short
lacking
in
overall
flavor
nothing
really
making
me
what
to
drink
more
i
bought
this
hoping
it
would
be
as
good
an
early
spring
beer
as
the
alpine
of
a
few
years
ago
pours
nicely
with
a
good
head
but
not
so
much
decoration
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
cloudy
and
golden
it
has
a
good
look
to
it
the
smell
is
different
for
the
style
with
a
large
malt
body
that
has
less
twang
and
more
bread
than
is
common
notes
of
vanilla
and
and
orange
with
light
coriander
an
almost
bubblegum
sweetness
taste
has
a
lot
of
fruitiness
the
added
plum
and
spices
body
is
quite
round
and
full
with
a
lemony
honey
maltiness
the
orange
peel
shows
in
the
the
finish
with
nice
zesty
kick
while
still
being
low
in
bitterness
just
enough
to
refresh
and
clean
the
palate
feel
is
on
the
thicker
side
for
a
wit
with
a
mild
carbonation
not
the
home
run
of
the
alpine
by
a
longshot
but
a
decent
quality
beer
nonetheless
o
not
a
bad
witbier
was
expecting
a
different
style
based
on
the
name
something
more
typically
taken
in
cold
weather
they
are
making
a
unique
twist
by
keeping
the
carbonation
down
and
tartness
up
keeping
it
dry
in
a
way
different
than
typical
for
the
style
osam
adams
and
their
spiced
witbiers
have
to
go
for
some
reason
they
can
not
get
this
style
done
right
overall
not
really
on
my
favorites
list
it
was
ok
but
nothing
special
the
rest
ive
had
a
lot
of
white
ales
and
there
are
some
that
i
really
like
and
a
lot
that
just
dont
do
a
lot
for
me
this
one
falls
into
that
latter
category
a
few
too
many
offnotes
to
be
really
enjoyable
single
bottle
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
a
cloudy
yelloworange
the
standard
witbier
hue
with
a
quickbreaking
but
reasonably
ample
white
head
smells
tangy
citric
almost
a
bit
metallic
or
sanguine
with
some
light
citrus
and
green
notes
apparent
tastes
like
a
proficiently
brewed
if
not
conservative
wit
the
coriander
is
right
where
it
should
be
i
e
barely
detectable
and
there
is
a
pleasant
orange
and
lemon
water
vibe
running
from
start
to
finish
i
get
some
wheat
spice
and
a
floral
almost
tobaccolike
faint
hop
presence
but
nothing
too
aggressive
maybe
a
hair
thicker
than
the
average
witbier
with
a
superclean
citric
finish
just
a
hint
of
woody
spice
seed
onedimensional
but
tasty
enough
i
suppose
does
not
match
the
grandeur
of
st
bernardus

the
like
but
does
not
embarrass
itself
either

another

another

to
grab

at

this
time
its
a
seasonal
wit
from
sam
adams
which
pours
a
hazy
tawnyorange
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
is
your
usual
wit
base
comprising
orange
peel
light
coriander
cracked
wheat
and
a
twist
of
lemon
added
on
is
a
decently
strong
sense
of
straight
grain
leaving
things
to
take
on
a
white
bread
sort
of
aroma
luckily
mostly
throughout
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
that
same
white
bread
bit
now
a
bit
louder
but
still
second
tier
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
crisp
finish
overall
an
okay
wit
but
that
breadiness
really
holds
it
back
if
nothing
else
its
better
than
the
cubs
performance
in
st
louis
overall
tastes
a
little
like
their
summer
ale
or
maybe
even
a
less
sweet
blue
moon
quite
drinkable
and
somewhat
refreshing
but
definitely
nothing
exciting
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
refreshing
a
seasonal
sam
adams
youll
look
forward
to
every
winter
i
apparently
enjoyed
samuel
adams
cold
snap
a
lot
more
than
most
other
reviewers
it
could
just
be
that
i
really
like
the
style
although
this
isnt
the
first
time
it
seems
to
be
a
trend
hesitant
at
first
i
was
glad
to
have
bought
an
entire
sixpack
in
fact
ill
probably
buy
another
next
spring
o
a
fairly
standard
witbier
offering
as
far
as
mouthfeel
and
appearance
go
but
perhaps
a
little
too
fruity
in
a
boxed
cereal
kind
of
way
for
the
witbier
affiocionado
good
not
awesome
pair
it
with
wheat
beer
foods
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
it
has
a
murky
orange
color
body
with
small
creamy
head
the
aroma
has
a
peppery
and
coriander
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
spicy
characters
to
it
pepper
and
coriander
are
the
ones
i
pick
up
i
also
get
a
little
citrus
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
overall
a
really
tasty
beer
o
overall
a
fairly
easy
drinking
spring
beer
for
the
breaking
of
seasons
not
to
bold
but
an
easy
drinking
relaxing
beer
with
just
the
right
amount
of
sweet
and
spicy
nature
to
spring
into
the
new
season
with
light
crisp
easy
drinking
multiple
overall
not
a
bad
witbier
however
much
better
on
tap
i
only
rate
brews
at
the
time
i
drink
them
since
i
dont
have
a
keg
at
home
this
review
is
from
bottles
the
feel
starts
off
bright
but
never
reaches
that
light
fluffiness
and
creamy
texture
the
style
strives
for
in
the
middle
after
the
smoothness
drops
off
comes
an
almost
pithy
chalky
dryness
thats
a
little
too
hard
rather
than
lightly
acidic
the
flavor
profile
is
convoluted
like
riding
on
a
rickety
rollercoaster
not
enjoyable
its
one
of
the
best
bargain
beers
ive
had
in
several
months
overall
a
pretty
decent
take
on
a
witbier
good
mix
of
citrus
fruit
esters
and
coriander
spice
notes
it
does
taste
like
every
other
sam
ive
ever
had
just
different
i
mean
that
in
the
best
and
worst
ways
i
love
and
hate
sam
overall
impression
meh
a
pretty
forgettable
witbier
overall
a
3
5
i
enjoyed
this
brew
and
the
kiss
of
plum
put
in
with
the
average
witbier
components
i
would
drink
this
on
a
cool
rainy
april
or
may
evening
i
may
buy
this
berw
again
samuel
adams
cold
snap
brew
by
boston
beer
company
pours
out
of
the
bottle
with
a
small
white
head
the
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
color
it
has
the
appearance
of
apple
cider
but
lighter
this
beer
is
not
filtered
so
it
is
cloudy
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
sweet
with
citrus
also
smell
rich
this
brew
has
smell
and
look
of
other
wheat
beers
on
the
market
the
taste
is
ok
nothing
fancy
but
you
can
taste
the
citrus
i
not
picking
up
on
the
plum
in
this
brew
cold
snap
goes
down
smooth
and
crisp
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
there
is
nothing
bad
about
the
taste
or
smell
of
this
brew
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
spring
night
after
a
long
day
over
all
i
giving
samuel
adams
cold
snap
a
4
out
5
one
of
the
better
samuel
adams
brews
i
had
very
easy
to
drink
onot
much
depth
to
the
flavor
here
easy
drinking
i
see
alot
of
illinoisans
and
hoosiers
have
tasted
this
one
recently
we
know
what
we
are
talking
about
when
it
comes
to
beer
and
pizza
this
is
definitely
a
good
pizza
pub
drinker
draught
this
one
pours
a
murky
yellow
color
there
was
a
bit
of
a
white
foam
head
that
left
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
ok
some
wheat
touch
of
orange
and
some
coriander
the
taste
is
ok
some
wheat
touch
of
the
coriander
and
faint
orange
not
the
best
witbier
but
not
bad
either
o
an
easy
drinker
but
kind
of
boring
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
either
it
was
like
they
decided
to
mix
the
darker
maltiness
of
most
of
their
other
beers
and
mix
it
into
this
witbier
this
beer
is
okay
and
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
but
i
dont
want
to
settle
for
this
because
there
are
so
many
better
beers
of
this
style
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
it
is
not
unlike
blue
moon
and
made
by
a
craft
brewer
this
is
probably
my
favorite
beer
from
samuel
adams
so
far
the
abv
of
5
3
means
you
can
enjoy
one
while
grilling
steaks
and
one
or
two
more
with
your
meal
very
drinkable
i
would
buy
this
again
no
problem
over
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
even
bought
some
at
the
store
this
was
enjoyable
nothing
really
jumps
out
but
all
in
all
its
very
drinkable
and
good
tasting
the
smell
has
a
that
sam
adams
holiday
spice
character
to
it
with
a
dose
of
citrus
mixed
in
this
goes
for
the
taste
as
well
its
good
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
overall
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
light
crisp
and
taste
great
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
beer
immediately
think
to
myself
how
many
different
ways
are
they
going
to
modify
and
repackage
the
samuel
adams
summer
ale
just
to
create
a
new
beer
on
at
local
eatery
very
simple
uncomplicated
beer
hazy
but
that
may
have
been
the
glass
i
ordered
it
not
knowing
it
was
called
cold
snap
i
only
knew
that
this
was
the
only
thing
the
restaurant
had
that
was
even
close
to
craft
i
though
it
may
have
been
a
wheat
beer
at
first
but
then
couldnt
think
of
any
wheat
beers
from
sam
until
now
i
was
better
than
any
adjunct
lager
thats
for
sure
this
was
a
nice
surprise
its
lighter
than
most
sam
adams
taste
not
color
but
it
still
had
good
body
interesting
that
they
went
with
something
like
this
for
a
cold
weather
beer
it
almost
has
citrus
notes
which
i
enjoy
nice
finish
low
bitterness
so
i
would
recommend
this
for
people
that
dont
normally
try
high
hoppy
beers
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
it
overall
this
is
pretty
decent
beer
appropriate
for
the
holiday
season
definitely
more
of
a
holiday
brew
that
white
christmas
o
very
refreshing
citrus
flavor
and
mouthfeel
great
for
this
brink
of
spring
season
pours
a
white
threefinger

that

not
sure
why
this
beer
is
getting
tagged
as
such
a
low
quality
sud
as
a
connoisseur
of
wheat
beer
this
is
a
better
than
average
brau
forget
that
a
mass
marketer
or
at
least
a
large
scale
microbrew
makes
it
it
pours
a
hazy
unfiltered
golden
color
with
moderate
carbonation
leaves
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
when
sipping
it
gives
the
wheat
taste
with
a
large
amount
of
citrus
mainly
orange
and
if
im
not
mistaken
has
the
coriander
vibe
going
as
well
great
session

weighing
in
at

abv
and
id
give
it
the
edge
on

worth
checking
out
and
grabbing
as
a
party
pleaser
beer
pours
golden
pale
and
hazy
developing
a
very
short
head
which
quickly
dissipates
the
nose
has
notes
of
citrus
and
wheat
medium
light

with
some
hints
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
and
apricot
on
the
palate
malty
sweetness
short
some

does
does
develop
thirst
quenching
i
am
not
a
huge
wit
fan
but
id
say
that
this
is
not
quite
done
to
style
overall
not
usually
a
fan
of
sam
adams
witbiers
but
i
found
this
one
to
be
very
drinkable
and
better
than
most
refreshing
and
clean
it
may
be
my
favorite
in
this
years
spring
variety
pack
while
not
a
breakthrough
beer
it
does
the
job
of
bringing
you
out
of
the
rich
winter
brews
heading
towards
the
lighter
beers
of
warm
weather
o
refreshing
and
a
touch
on
the
spicy
side
cold
snap
is
a
decent
wit
a
remarkably
surprisingly
good
beer
here
winter
seasonal
not
expected
to
be
anything
special
but
this
is
darn
good
like
a
blue
moon
in
some
sense
with
out
the
herbal
properties
and
the
yeast
intensity
i
like
this
a
lot
not
that
hazy
and
not
that
pale
doesnt
really
look
the
part
but
it
has
a
robust
two
inches
of
white
head
that
dont
fade
a
lick
the
nose
is
nice
a
little
sweet
definitely
grain
driven
with
a
light
citrus
hopping
and
fresh
bread
aromatics
breakfast
bread
the
flavor
is
similar
heavier
wheat
malt
base
is
nice
and
the
leftover
sugar
really
is
too
it
gives
some
pleasant
body
but
the
beer
stays
light
due
to
excellent
carbonation
there
is
almost
a
lemongrass
flavor
to
it
a
somewhat
fruity
somewhat
grassy
element
i
cannot
quite
place
but
it
makes
this
beer
stand
out
from
the
crowd
i
am
surprised
i
liked
this
as
much
as
i
did
a
semimacroish
seasonal
witbier
turns
out
is
exceptional
crossing
the
boundary
between
refreshing
and
hearty
extremely
enjoyable
really
creamy
and
flavorful
overall
a
nice
break
from
the
typical
winter
brews
the
6pack
was
enough
though
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
seems
like
they
were
going
for
a
blue
moon
copy
if
they
were
id
say
they
pretty
much
succeeded
o
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
witbier
probably
my
2nd
favorite
of
the
6
in
the
spring
seasonal
6
pack
certainly
worth
a
try
id
drink
this
one
again
o
like
just
about
all
sam
adams
beers
this
one
was
very
drinkable
as
well
as
very
interesting
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one

there
is
a

it

the
cold

is
very
similar
to
all
the
other
white
ales
that
samuel

has
produced
the
beer
pours
a

overall
this
is
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
spectacular
overall
sam
adams
seems
to
change
its
spring
seasonal
every
year
and
im
glad
they
made
this
switch
would
love
to
see
it
as
an
annual
as
it
would
work
for
all
seasons
if
you
have
a
friend
who
swears
by
blue

slip
them
one
of
these
its
better
also
better
than
most
spring
seasonals
globally
would
drink
again
overall
my
main
problem
with
cold
snap
was
the
lack
of
malts
the
orange
and
spice
were
good
but
they
need
malts
in
order
to
round
this
one
out
this
was
refreshing
but
is
not
a
beer
i
will
run
out
to
buy
more
of
any
time
soon

its
light
and
grainy
body
is
creamy
to
start
but
quickly
fall
apart
because
of
its
scrubbing
mineral
and
grain
qualities
crystalclean
in
its
delivery
that
also
becomes
the
beers
problem
its
so
clean
that
it
reveals
the
grain
flavor
and
texture
to
limit
its
enjoyment
it
also
highlights
is
plasterlike
taste
and
texture
to
much
the
same
malaise
overall
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
witbier
style
but
being
sam
adams
i
wanted
to
give
it
a
try
it
fits
the
style
characteristics
almost
to
a
tee
just
not
my
style
it
is
not
something
that
i
want
to
drink
frequently
but
a
change
that
is
ok
once
in
a
while
overall
a
pretty
good
wit
better
than
blue

id
have
kit
again
maybe
even
in
the
summer

creamy

with

very
drinkable
spring
seasonal
overall
a
god
beer
to
be
introduced
to
the
style
a
nicely
blended
unique
yet
hits
the
style
witbier
a
decent
enough
version
of
a
witbier
sort
of
faded
around
the
edges
but
the
meat
of
the
matter
is
still
intact
which
is
all
fine
and
good
but
this
is
certainly
a
warmer
weather
offering
so
im
thinking
theres
something
lost
in
translation
here
up
here
a
cold
snap
is
a
prolonged
period
of
subzero
temps
im
guessing
that
bbc
assumes
a
different
stress
as
in
a
snap
to
the
existing
cold
i
e
springtime
yall
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
crisp
mouth
feel
it
has
an
aroma
and
taste
that
is
reminiscent
of
citrus
more
so
of
oranges
im
a
fan
of
these
types
of
beers
because
i
much
rather
pair
my
beer
with
a
slice
of
orange
of
any
other
citrus
its
reminiscent
other
other
beers
like
shock
top
but
it
has
a
distinction
all
its
own
im
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
the
murky
haze
of
a
wheat
ale
makes
me
feel
like
im
drinking
something
hearty
and
not
just
beer
flavored
water
overall
this
was
a
decent
witbier
id
have
it
again
especially
the
other
five
that
i
have
in
the
6pack
o
a
step
above
a
blue
moon
but
nothing
great
it
tastes
a
little
artificial
with
some
cardboardy
notes
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
levels
a
fine
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
opaque
yelloworange
coloring
with
a
thin
whispy
white
head
nose
of
citrus
sweet
pound
cake
pineapple
and
toasted
grains
flavors
are
citrus
forward
with
a
subtle
bready
backbone
and
some
light
spicing
smooth
and
light
in
mouth
with
a
sweet
and
sugary
aftertaste
light
smooth
finish
tastes
like
a
knockoff
of
the
old
white
to
me
pours
a
hazy
dirty
blonde
color
white
frothy
head
subsides
to
a
ring
and
leaves
little
lace
aroma
of
wheat
and
a
bit
of
a
fruity
twang
in
the
taste
citrus
firm
malt
and
mild
clove
all
dial
in
there
is
a
lemony
aspect
to
the
brew
as
well
as
a
small
earthy
bitterness
medium
bodied
and
easy
drinking
brew
the
tangy
citrus
lingers
into
the
finish
for
quite
a
while
overall
a
pretty
refreshing
wheat
here
accessible
and
would
appeal
to
a
wide
audience
of
beer
drinkers
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
rather
thin
and
watery
with
little
flavor
not
sure
what
bbc
was
going
for
here
but
its
not
a
good
example
of
the
witbier
style
its
not
bad
but
its
a
bit
macro
tasting
especially
on
the
finish
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
one
again
o
i
could
see
this
an
easy
to
drink
dog
days
of
summer
beer
but
during
this
the
great
artic
winter
of
2014
it
seems
oddly
out
of
place
it
isnt
terrible
but
its
hardly
great
either
the
only
difference
between
this
and
blue
moon
is
that
its
not
served
with
an
orange
peel
the
taste
is
dominated
by
sweetness
and
oranges
with
a
little
bit
of
wheat
not
much
worth
noting
in
the
aroma
or
mouthfeel
department
seems
like
sam
adams
is
trying
to
compete
with
blue
moon
and
shocktop
on
this
rather
than
a
serious
attempt
at
a
witbier
like
allagash
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
revisit
68100
overall
i
give
this
around
the
c
to
b
range
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
beer
again
not
that
it
was
horrible
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
of
the
dark
fruitiness
and
it
could
have
been
less
sweet
but
in
general
the
cold
snap
was
a
very
well
put
together
beer
that
wouldnt
offend
anyone
o
i
liked
it
better
on
draft
as
i
do
most
beers
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
an
easy
to
drink
witbier
overall
decent
crowd
pleaser
for
those
just
venturing
into
the
craft
beer
scene
hazy
yellow
almost
off
orange
color
with
a
very
white
head
that
was
about
a
finger
on
the
top
of
the
beer
head
lingered
for
a
little
while
smells
heavy
on
the
orange
and
wheat
and
tastes
the
same
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
beer
for
wheat
fans
who
like
a
little
extra
fruit
flavor
in
their
without
going
all
the
way
to
a
fruit
beer
in
my
opinion
this
was
a
terrific
beer
great
smell
feel
taste
i
was
in
love
with
the
aftertaste
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
the
aftertaste
was
though
it
reminded
me
of
the
taste
of
buttered
popcorn
jelly
beans
i
really
loved
this
i
got
it
on
tap
at
ruby
tuesdays
and
couldnt
be
more
happy
with
picking
it
over
all
the
options
i
highly
recommend
the
appearance
is
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
dissolves
quickly
the
light
and
crisp
citrus
plays
on
the
smell
in
the
forefront
with
a
little
bit
of
wheat
on
the
back
end
i
loved
the
smell
very
fizzy
on
the
first
sip
with
many
of
the
citrus
flavors
coming
out
a
lot
of
lemongrass
and
a
little
bit
of
coriander
and
spice
on
the
end
it
was
a
lot
lighter
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
from
the
smell
but
i
ended
up
liking
that
its
still
a
bit
too
cold
for
this
beer
but
by
march
or
april
i
can
definitely
see
grabbing
a
twelve
pack
or
two
one
of
my
only
criticisms
is
that
its
very
similar
to
their
white
christmas
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
easy
drinking
not
a
wow
beer
but
solid
for
sure
id
recommend
it
to
those
who
like
wheat
beers
o
i
cant
get
the
image
of
an
old
lady
salon
out
of
my
head
when
drinking
this
beer
not
a
winning
seasonal
but
a
decent
offering
to
session
i
wanted
to
like
this
but
its
too
safe
and
lacks
creativity
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
first
sipped
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
3
finger
head
very
cloudy
i
loved
the
white
ale
and
it
was
snatched
away
by
sam
adams
i
looked
forward
to
that
beer
every
spring
that
being
said
cold
snap
is
very
similar
and
familiar
it
has
a
classic
old
samuel
adams
scent
with
orange
peel
coriander
lemon
zest
and
grainy
wheat
the
scent
is
also
very
floral
where
i
think
it
does
out
do
white
ale
is
the
aftertaste
which
is
sweet
not
cloying
and
crisp
anytime
jim
koch
puts
a
light
blue
cap
on
the
bottle
its
a
good
one
nothing
special
but
i
wasnt
expecting
much
it
was
collateral
damage
of
a
sampler
pack
left
in
my
fridge
im
very
seriously
getting
bored
with
sam
adams
wheat
beers
jim
what
is
your
obsession
rjt
overall
worth
picking
up
and
a
fairly
decent
witbier
worth
picking
up
just
to
stick
it
to
coors
this
beer
is
decent
nothing
too
special
but
worth
the
6
99
a
six
pack
or
whatever
i
do
like
the
idea
of
wheat
beer
as
a
winter
time
brew
since
the
spices
seem
to
go
well
with
it
hazy
light
brown
to
amber
in
color
a
quarter
inch
white
foam
entirely
covers
the
top
of
this
beer
i
get
a
bit
of
coriander
and
pale
wheat
in
the
nose
the
mouth
is
brisk
and
sharp
i
get
a
faint
hint
of
orange
peelbut
mainly
restrained
usage
of
corianderwhich
is
oh
so
easy
to
overdo
this
belgian
wit
is
restrainedbut
well
balanced
originally
got
it
in
a
sampler
but
liked
it
and
bought
more
good
cost
for
a
sixer
good
looking
beer
typical
wheat
that
smells
great
clean
and
sweet
excellent
tasting
beer
sweet
and
crisp
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
will
revisit
regularly
but
why
is
this
a
winter
beer
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
sam
adams
finally
nailed
one
this
one
is
top
shelf
m
the
finish
was
extremely
short
light
body
a
bit
syrupy
making
matters
worse
the
designer
went
with
all
capital
letters
but
larger
initialletter
capitalization
someone
had
the
same
idea
with
the
building
names
at
emory
university
its
whats
known
in
the
trade
as
a
bad
idea
cold
snap
decent
appearance
a
weird
mixture
of
scents
but
a
mouthfeel
unlike
a
brew
i
have
had
in
quite
some
time
i
did
find
that
smell
of
the
brew
matched
the
taste
but
i
like
the
taste
over
the
beers
smell
way
much
more
overall
i
enjoyed
the
brew
and
would
definitely
down
a
few
more
given
the
chance
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
after
warming
the
flavors
expanded
to
create
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
i
wouldnt
object
to
having
again
o
what
a
weird
beer
its
all
over
the
place
with
off
flavors
odors
and
feels
like
some
sort
of
frankensteins
monster
the
joke
is
on
me
though
as
this
is
definitely
not
like
any
of
sas
recent
witbier
offerings
not
good
either
at
2
99
for
a
bomber
i
thought
it
was
a
good
price
it
just
isnt
a
very
good
beer
t
heavy
wheat
coriander
clove
upfront
big
bready
note
in
the
middle
with
a
touch
of
spice
finish
carries
a
lot
of
that
breadiness
into
it
mouthfeel
is
wet
and
a
bit
heavy
its
ok
taste
is
more
of
the
spice
up
front
with
a
mild
touch
of
citrus
and
fruit
cold
snap
is
a
lively
easytodrink
session
brew
and
an
enjoyable
one
at
that
no
problems
here
overall
it
is
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
unfortunately
revised
downwards
gets
worse
and
more
funky
as
it
warms
paired
with
a
delicious
cheeseburger
and
bottomless
fries
a
very
tasty
witbier
the
citrus
flavors
are
very
prominent
yet
meld
well
with
the
malt
and
wheat
grains
outstanding
depth
and
complexity
and
very
wellbalanced
throughout
its
been
a
while
since
ive
been
fireup
about
a
witbier
or
even
a
sam
adams
product
but
this
particular
brew
excels
across
the
board
for
this
style
o
i
used
to
love
the
original
samuel
adams
white
ale
and
have
expressed
varying
degrees
of
satisfaction
and
disappointment
with
each
subsequent
take
on
the
style
the
company
has
released
cold
snap
however
takes
me
back
to
my
discovery
of
that
beer
and
my
early
days
of
imbibing
craft
beers
if
you
like
me
enjoyed
the
original
samuel
adams
white
ale
you
will
be
delighted
to
know
that
cold
snap
is
a
worthy
replacement
many
of
the
flavor
components
are
the
same
and
all
in
all
it
is
probably
as
close
to
the
original
as
we
are
going
to
get
at
this
point
o
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
poured
a
golden
orange
body
with
minimal
head
and
lace
with
a
decent
witbier
aroma
of
minor
citric
hopsspice
and
touches
of
yeast
beer
is
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
but
too
simplistic
to
be
a
great
wit
more
commercialized
the
spice
and
coriander
are
minimal
on
the
edges
to
add
a
little
oomph
to
the
citric
flavors
and
it
finishes
light
and
with
a
crisp
edge
not
a
bad
beer
and
there
were
touches
of
sweetness
at
times
in
the
beer
overall
new
to
the
style
but
i
like
this
beer
better
than
the
sam
adams
white
christmas
not
bad
and
very
drinkable
orange
hazy
ale
wreaking
head
but
nice
lacing
clean
citrus
aroma
big
orange
and
tangerines
right
away
on
the
palate
hints
of
floral
spices
fresh
leafy
veggie
like
hop
well
balanced
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
crisp
refreshing
finish
great
beer
for
end
of
winter
or
early
spring
overall
a
damn
good
witbier
i
am
not
a
big
drinker
of
the
style
but
this
was
a
nice
one
to
have
like
many
beers
from
the
boston
beer
company
this
would
make
a
good
gateway
beer
to
those
newer
to
craft
beers
and
its
definitely
something
to
have
those
who
swear
by
blue
moon
to
try
it
still
surprises
me
that
the
samuel
adams
line
expands
at
a
nearalarming
rate
yet
the
beers
are
consistently
winners
o
pretty
average
for
a
wit
not
bad
at
all
but
not
above
average
good
abv
so
it
is
a
good
session
beer
i
am
dismissing
this
beer
as
bad
marketing
not
bad
quite
easy
drinking
and
gong
nicely
with
salad
nuts
and
goat
cheese
respectable
seasonal
from
sa
o
this
is
not
something
that
will
set
the
world
on
fire
but
i
can
still
say
its
honestly
quite
good
i
like
it
better
than
alpine
spring
too
actually
ill
go
one
better
and
say
its
my
favorite
sa
seasonal
regular
to
date
its
not
saying
a
whole
lot
still
id
entertain
the
notion
of
buying
a
6pack
of
this
poured
into
my
trusty
stella
artois
pint
glass
clean
crisp
and
very
clear
with
minimal
head
went
down
really
smooth
the
taste
is
above
average
and
one
of
the
best
white
beers
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
it
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
very
cold
indiana
day
when
we
were
colder
than
the
other
49
states
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
a
mix
of
yeast
and
spice
with
the
wheat
playing
a
subordinate
role
and
still
adding
enough
to
make
the
flavor
cohesive
but
not
extraordinary
i
like
the
way
you
taste
coriander
right
away
and
it
does
make
it
a
bit
snappy
pun
intended
with
a
nice
peppery
aspect
with
the
orange
element
taking
second
and
that
helps
the
wheat
malt
which
is
the
foundation
not
much
else
to
comment
on
except
i
like
how
the
taste
finishes
dry
overall
i
enjoy
what
samuel
adams
does
with
wheat
i
know
we
are
not
talking
infinium
but
this
is
pretty
good
as
far
as
wit
beers
go
for
an
offering
from
a
macrobrew
this
years
s
a
excels
light
crisp
fresh
perfect
compliment
to
a
winter
evening
at
the
lodge
overall
well
not
enjoyable
in
the
least
by
far
one
of
the
worst
beers
from
boston
beer
co
that
ive
had
in
a
very
long
time
wheat
ok
but
too
much
wheat
orange
zest
meh
just
weird
orange
icing
flavors
and
fake
vanilla
with
other
spices
into
a
predigested
gingerbread
and
orange
cake
with
tons
of
orange
frosting
thats
just
not
good
even
the
finish
doesnt
know
how
to
um
finish
between
the
sticky
dry
creamy
syrupy
etc
cant
imagine
why
they
would
put
this
out
i
cant
even
finish
it
i
almost
want
to
order
this
at
a
bar
one
day
so
i
can
spit
it
in
their
face
and
demand
a
different
beer
just
so
i
can
waste
it
then
again
it
might
taste
better
spit
out
this
samuel
adams
brew
is
similar
to
blue
moon
and
other
macro
brewed
white
ales
in
many
ways
i
find
it
agreeable
and
likeable
but
i
know
there
are
those
who
will
criticize
it
for
not
being
unique
or
full
bodied
enough
it
seems
like
a
decent
beer
for
those
times
when
you
just
want
a
simple
white
ale
without
the
pretense
give
it
a
try
if
you
can
its
easy
to
find
and
has
enough
going
for
it
to
recommend
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
nice
example
of
a
witbier
with
spices
and
orange
peels
it
had
good
balance
with
the
orange
being
right
below
the
point
of
being
too
much
with
just
enough
spices
to
provide
some
balance
and
all
that
smoothness
that
comes
with
the
style
this
beer
had
good
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
a
little
crisp
refreshing
a
little
filling
and
the
taste
did
a
nice
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
once
it
starts
to
warm
up
outside
its
got
about
the
same
drinkability
as
oberon
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
the
spices
werent
overdone
that
tends
to
happen
often
in
this
style
but
not
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
that
they
put
it
out
and
promote
it
so
early
i
like
the
beer
just
not
when
its
still
below
freezing
in
michigan
but
im
sure
in
a
few
months
from
now
it
will
fit
in
good
with
the
weather
i
might
buy
this
again
when
it
gets
warmer
but
theres
good
chance
ill
just
go
with
oberon
instead
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
like
your
witbiers
heavy
on
the
orange
all
in
all
i
didnt
mind
this
beer
it
was
good
for
what
it
is
and
i
find
it
to
be
similar
to
oberon
but
i
like
oberon
more
since
oberon
tastes
more
wheaty
with
a
nice
yeast
flavor
nice
work
guys
this
was
a
solid
example
of
the
style
keep
up
the
solid
work
pours
a
nice
cloudy
yellowish
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
onefinger
creamy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
nice
yeast
notes
slight
bananna
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
malty
yeasty
with
some
spice
notes
medium
body
overall
a
tasty
little
brew
this
beer
from
the
spring
mix
pack
is
a
cloudy
ultra
hazy
straw
color
the
smell
is
soft
and
subtle
with
a
a
little
wheat
and
some
orange
and
lemon
scents
coriander
and
paper
the
flavor
is
moderately
sweet
not
at
all
bitter
a
bit
citrusy
and
spicy
in
the
finish
smooth
and
enjoyable
but
not
inspiring
overall
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beer
i
liked
this
one
picked
up
in
a
variety
pack
so
i
am
hoping
the
others
deliver
as
well
as
this
one
a
refreshing
ale
though
the
fruitspice
additions
while
well
balanced
and
welcome
are
not
at
all
restrained
so
this
is
almost
a
specialty
beer
rather
than
a
true
witbier
overall
the
brewed
with
spice
with
spice
added
line
on
the
bottle
scared
me
as
i
was
expecting
a
nasty
spice
bomb
but
this
is
actually
very
close
to
your
traditional
wit
in
all
its
okay
pretty
run
of
the
mill
craft
wit
nothing
id
necessarily
buy
again
but
if
it
finds
its
way
into
next
springs
mix
pack
i
wont
avoid
it
eminently
drinkable
but
more
like
a
spring
or
summer
beer
a
late
april
cold
snap
or
something
to
remind
you
of
spring
when
its
far
off
maybe
a
bit
too
insubstantial
this
pours
a
hazy
dark
lemonade
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
sweet
citrus
coriander
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
blue
moon
with
the
use
of
orange
and
spices
that
are
mixed
with
wheat
the
finish
is
a
little
unusual
with
a
dry
bite
poured
into
my
tulip
bright
hazy
yellow
with
an
orange
tint
bright
white
head
very
sweet
smelling
clean
musty
herbal
aroma
i
was
very
happy
to
find
it
tasted
very
similar
to
alpine
spring
granted
they
are
two
different
styles
sweeter
that
alpine
spring
less
hop
bitterness
all
around
great
beer
pours
a
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
huge
fluffy
head
that
persists
forever
aromas
of
lime
and
pepper
dominate
as
well
as
a
meringue
kind
of
thing
going
on
light
wheaty
spice
and
coriander
round
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
with
honey
and
wow
again
its
like
key
lime
pie
with
a
bit
of
pepper
and
coriander
thrown
in
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
spicy
mouthfeel
this
beer
surprise
me
a
bit
but
i
really
kind
of
enjoyed
it
pours
a
hazy
apricot
in
color
with
a
good
1finger
white
head
but
didnt
last
a
long
time
some
spotty
lacing
was
seen
with
each
sip
though
the
ring
settled
back
to
the
top
perfect
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
light
fruits
with
a
slight
light
orangepeel
the
taste
is
very
pleasing
with
the
fruits
and
spices
of
a
pepperybite
of
corriander
coming
through
that
ends
in
a
slight
dryness
on
the
tongue
for
the
finish
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easy
sam
adams
has
some
great
seasonal
brews
out
there
and
this
one
will
not
disapoint
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
drinkable
meaning
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
has
a
safe
and
commercial
feel
to
it
although
that
may
be
in
part
due
to
my
expectations
it
tastes
comparable
in
quality
to
blue
moon
overall
this
is
better
than
most
of
sam
adamss
seasonable
beers
but
its
not
something
id
seek
out
this
is
thoroughly
ok
slightly
better
than
blue
moon
perhaps
but
well
below
a
good
wit
or
weizen
not
sure
which
they
were
shooting
for
but
it
comes
across
more
like
the
former
drinks
easy
enough
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
sort
of
a
trainingwheels
wit
overall
too
thick
and
heavily
spiced
not
really
something
that
i
found
all
that
palatable
atmosphere
is
pretty
strong
large
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
fruity
and
spicy
starchy
white
bread
sweet
fruits
citrus
fruits
and
spice
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
overall
good
potential
in
the
flavor
the
rest
is
meh
another
middle
of
the
road
offering
from
sam
adams
the
bubblegum
esters
are
slightly
offputting
to
me
overall
its
a
light
wheaty
not
particularly
compelling
beer
o
nice
easy
drinking
beer
that
is
probably
the
most
refreshing
of
the
spring
variety
pack
im
normally
a
sam
adams
fan
but
this
one
didnt
make
the
cut
otoh
i
have
never
liked
the
belgian
style
and
this
is
a
bit
of
that
the
taste
is
also
of
soft
and
breaded
malts
with
a
notable
oat
character
followed
by
a
crispy
mlldly
bitter
lingering
finish
cold
snap
is
a
fresh
tasting
little
brew
it
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
light
fruit
and
coriander
the
taste
is
really
light
there
isnt
much
going
on
this
is
a
good
beer
to
compete
with
blue
moon
drinkers
over
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
light
citrus
i
may
buy
some
of
this
and
save
it
for
warmer
months
i
think
it
would
be
better
in
the
summer
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spice
and
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
fruit
and
floral
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
fruity
presence
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
am
a
fan
of
big
complex
beers
but
sometimes
it
is
nice
to
find
a
beer
that
is
a
good
consistent
easy
drinker
that
you
can
have
a
few
of
while
watching
a
game
this
is
what
sam
adams
has
done
here
as
this
is
an
above
average
take
on
this
style
i
think
they
finally
found
a
spring
seasonal
they
can
stick
with
unless
they
decide
to
make
it
year
round
the
verdict
i
like
it
a
belgian
white
ale
with
very
good
balance
and
a
nice
mouthfeel
much
better
than
the
alpine
spring
it
replaces
this
could
easily
become
a
sa
favorite
for
me
honestly
this
is
sam
adams
version
of
a
blue
moon
with
maybe
a
little
more
spice
if
thats
your
beer
youll
love
this
really
tasty
beer
sam
adams
seems
to
have
had
an
identity
crises
the
past
several
years
on
sticking
with
a
spring
seasonal
but
this
time
i
think
they
got
it
right
i
was
very
happy
with
the
white
ale
they
had
from
20042010
but
then
they
went
all
over
the
place
with
noble
pils
and
alpine
spring
this
time
they
brought
back
the
white
ale
with
a
little
extra
very
well
done
really
hope
they
stick
with
this
one
this
time
i
dont
understand
the
reviews
that
saw
this
is
super
sweet
i
dont
taste
it
really
strong
white
and
very
good

abv
and
does
not
hide
it
this
doesnt
mean
its
a
bad
beer
in
fact
its
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
offerings
if
you
want
a
beer
that
has
a
great
taste
and
punches
you
in
the
face
with
its
abv
you
have
to
try
this
regardless
it
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
sickeningly
sweet
this
tastes
as
if
you
took
one
of
those
gummy
orange
slice
candies
then
melted
it
mixed
it
with
orange
triplesec
carbonated
it
and
put
it
in
a
fancy
overpriced
beer
bottle
if
you
like
candy
and
oranges
and
lots
of
alcohol
and
sugar
then
youll
like
this
this
is
beer
too
sweet
for
me
however
it
may
be
wonderful
with
sauerkraut
and
sausage
and
pork
imho
this
beer
is
very
out
of
balance
way
to
much
sweetness
that
is
not
offset
by
the
hop
additions
mouthfeel
is
chewy
and
luxurious
smell
was
all
alcohol
and
cloying
sweetness
taste
was
just
like
the
smell
to
much
of
both
alcohol
and
malt
apperance
was
nice
about
a
finger
of
head
and
good
lace
on
the
glass
overall
the
overpowering
sweetness
in
both
the
smell
and
taste
was
just
too
much

out

an
absolutely
amazing
imperial
so
sad
its
be
discontinued
but
luckily
i
bought
out
the
store
for
years
to
come
this
beer
is
great
off
the
shelf
and
astonishing
in
taste
years
later
i
have
four
year
old
bottles
i
open
for
very
special
occasions
and
the
taste
is
similar
to
a
fine
port
wine
in
about
10
years
when
my
stock
is
empty
i
will
be
upset
with
sam
adams
for
their
mistakable
choice
of
discontinuing
it
sweet
enjoyable
repeatable
o
this
one
doesnt
work
for
me
it
tastes
a
lot
like
the
gose
from
sam
adams
i
just
reviewed
i
hope
all
four
beers
from
the
sampler
pack
dont
taste
like
a
variance
from
the
same
base
recipe
anyway
it
just
tastes
like
stale
old
beer
that
was
stored
improperly
the
alcohol
and
the
sweetness
is
so
big
that
it
makes
it
hard
to
drink
tastes
a

this
is
not

my
personal
favorites
or
styles
but
it
is
quite
well
crafted
i
would
highly
recommend
it
this
really
has
turned
into
more
of
a
belgium
dubbel
with
the
candi
presence
dried
pitted
fruit
as
well
i
bought
this
due
to
the
fact
i
got
whacked
off
one
bottle
which
i
believed
to
be
a
great
preflight
craft
fresh
this
was
too
perfumy
and
a
lot
of
exentuated
wheated
present
ie
bananas
and
clove
this
has
aged
in
a
way
i
had
not
imagined
one
of
the
highest
caloric
intake
brews
and
not
sure
i
would
ever
waste
any
more
time
with
thisdont
feel
like
running
extra
miles
over
this
honestly
i
tried
this
because
of
a
friend
after
drinking
it
with
all
my
buddies
i
made
the
statement
it
tastes
like
a
stronger
version
of
boston
lager
after
saying
it
all
my
friend
tried
it
again
and
came
to
the
very
same
conclusion
however
thats
just
me
tryi
it
for
yourself
i
do
in
full
disclosure
tend
to
favor
the
witbier
style
making
my
opinion
slightly
bias
in
favor
of
this
imperial
white
an
interesting
citrus
and
spice
witbier
thicker
and
heavier
than
expected

solid
effort

this

not
a
good
choice
for
a

but
could
be

on
a

more
like

than
witbier
the
beer
is
handsome
solid

with
a
large

notes
of
classic

chewy
on
the
palate

the
spice
is
there
at
the
end
but
not
enough
o
because
of
the
thick

maltyfruity
taste
and
conspicuous
alcohol
this
one
drinks
like
a
barleywine
not
your
typical
wit
but
a
tasty
brew
nonetheless
overall
had
potential
but
ultimately
its
a
bit
of
a
boozy
sticky
mess
nothing
id
buy
again
in
terms
of
how
it
drinks
its
probably
much
closer
to
belgian
dubbel
than
what
i
would
imagine
an
imperial
wit
to
be
o
a
very
unique
beer
this
beer
is
not
outstanding
but
its
very
good
one
of
the
more
unique
beers
ive
ever
sampled
in
that
yes
its
obviously
a
wheat
beer
but
has
many
characteristics
not
usually
or
ever
in
my
experience
noticed
in
a
witbier
a
very
good
but
not
outstanding
beer
that
id
recommend
it
for
any
extreme
beer
fans
i
would
have
this
again
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
this
beer
is
a
rich
amber
color
not
exactly
witbier
in
color
it
does
have
some
haze
and
a
brilliant
white
head
the
aroma
is
enchanting
loads
of
spice
coriander
pepper
and
a
caramel
toffee
candy
like
background
some
candiedfruit
is
present
in
the
aroma
as
well
along
with
yeast
banana
and
a
hint
of
clove
woody
and
boozelike
the
taste
is
moderately
sweeet
but
not
at
all
with
the
crisp
tartlike
qualities
of
a
traditional
wit
interesting
and
very
enveloping
the
alcohol
shows
up
in
a
prominent
warmth
full
body
this
is
a
cool
weather
brew
nice
o
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
brew
im
somewhat
skeptical
of
sam
adams
and
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
very
glad
i
did
very
well
put
together
brew
i
would
buy
this
again
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
slightly
hazy
copper
with
a
thick
off
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
the
beer
appears
to
be
well
carbonated
due
to
the
presence
of
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
in
the
beer
not
much
lacing
is
left
behind
on
the
side
of
the
glass
i
pick
up
the
wheat
in
the
aroma
as
well
as
the
spice
notes
its
not
a
strong
aroma
overall
but
i
can
pick
up
hints
of
coriander
with
citrus
also
make
no
mistake
about
it
the
booze
is
noticeable
in
the
aroma
even
when
this
beer
is
well
chilled
like
in
the
aroma
the
spice
notes
take
a
back
seat
to
the
malt
and
the
booze
the
spices
notes
are
there
and
i
do
get
the
coriander
pepper
and
citrus
in
the
flavor
the
sweetness
is
almost
like
honey
in
many
ways
the
body
is
full
with
enough
carbonation
to
make
this
beer
clean
on
the
finish
the
alcohol
provides
a
nice
warming
feel
this
is
a
good
beer
for
what
it
is
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
classify
this
as
a
witbier
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
levels
of
quality
of
an
excellent
wheatwine
which
is
how
im
judging
this
beer
samuel
adams
imperial
white
45
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
slight
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
full
of
character
with
some
fruity
and
indistinct
sweet
notes
bready
flavor
with
lots
o
balancing
components
fruit
honey
spice
and
citrus
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
overall
this
was
just
not
my
thing
i
was
excited
at
the
prospect
of
the
style
from
sam
adams
but
this
just
isnt
their
best
work
im
sure
with
some
tweaks
to
the
amount
of
sweetening
ingredients
they
used
it
could
become
much
more
enjoyable
this
is
my
first
imperial
from
sam
adams
this
beer
looks
nice
in
the
glass
and
pours
well
but
both
things
are
soon
forgotten
as
the
taste
is
sickly
sweet
banana
flavor
with
some
strange
spice
after
taste
its
body
is
syrupy
its
like
a
cross
between
a
cheap
malt
liquor
and
a
badly
made
witbier
in
fact
id
probably
rather
just
have
the
malt
liquor
sam
adams
is
not
my
favorite
brewery
but
i
normally
find
their
beers
sessionable
they
need
to
withdraw
this
one
i
may
have
been
harsh
on
this
beer
but
i
expect
better
from
them
this
is
a
very
attractive
beer
to
look
at
and
the
smell
of
malt
and
spices
is
pleasant
but
eventually
you
have
to
stop
staring
and
sniffing
and
actually
drink
it
then
you
are
just
assaulted
all
the
fruits
and
spices
and
malt
and
booze
just
hammer
you
the
common
theme
with
all
these
imperial
series
beers
is
this
syrupy
sweet
flavor
bomb
it
works
really
well
in
the
imperial
stout
not
here
the
smell
was
interesting
i
was
initially
intrigued
really
is
a
beautiful
beer
loved
watching
it
while
it
filled
up
my
glass
like
bubbly
golden
straw
really
large
head
but
right
when
it
enters
your
mouth
you
are
just
struck
with
a
strong
pungent
burst
it
discourages
you
from
taking
a
large
sip
i
powered
through
and
was
not
rewarded
it
is
really
just
disgusting
too
many
flavors
buying
for
your
attention
and
they
are
like
steam
rollers
on
your
taste
buds
they
dont
get
along
save
your
money
and
dont
buy
this
beer
its
only
good
to
look
at
i
ended
up
using
75
of
the
24
oz
bottle
for
cooking
because
i
couldnt
handle
anymore
awfulness
i
really
dont
understand
how
anyone
could
enjoy
this
beer
i
cant
help
but
wonder
if
i
had
a
skunky
bottle
given
the
lack
of
best
by
date
i
would
be
curious
to
see
how
this
one
tasted
after
a
good
year
or
two
of
cellaring
maybe
its
just
a
very
unbalanced
beer
its
pretty
to
look
at
so
i
guess
there
is
that
my
pour
produced
a
massive
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
bubbly
tawny
head
that
cascaded
from
the
bottom
and
fell
from
the
top
leaving
nice
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
cloudy
orangishamber
i
definitely
got
coriander
and
anise
on
the
nose
along
with
a
soft
mixed
fruitiness
reminiscent
of
chewingbubble
gum
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
creamy
but
the
taste
was
a
bit
too
riotous
and
unbalanced
for
my
taste
i
found
myself
unable
to
distinguish
between
all
of
the
flavors
trying
to
happen
all
at
once
on
my
tongue
i
got
vanilla
loads
of
spice
and
dried
dark
fruit
but
it
was
all
too
much
to
parse
finish
was
kind
of
hot
on
top
of
everything
else
man
this
was
much
too
intense
for
the
style
not
everything
needs
to
be
imperialized
o
not
sam
adams
best
offering
a
decent
beerbut
it
doesnt
quite
come
together
cheers
overall
this
one
is
pretty
hard
to
drink
very
boozy
its
too
sweet
too
not
really
able
to
finish
this
one
i
was
keen
to
try
this
after
having
the
sam
adams
imperial
stout
which
i
personally
enjoyed
this
turned
out
to
be
a
pretty
unique
beer
certainly
not
like
other
witbeirs
ive
had
and
i
cant
recall
seeing
too
many
other
imperial
whites
it
was
a
pleasant
change
from
the
beers
i
usually
drink
but
nothing
too
outstanding
very
very
sweet
as
im
sure
is
expected
with
some
semicomplex
flavors
make
for
a
nice
if
not
extraordinary
white
i
appreciate
the
effort
here
but
it
just
doesnt
amount
to
anything
worth
writing
home
about
to
be
blunt
this
beer
blows
its
sweet
and
has
an
overthetop
alcoboozy
taste
that
lingers
like
you
just
took
a
swig
of
isopropyl
from
the
medicine
cabinet
no
wait
that
might
actually
taste
better
mouthfeel
and
appearance
are
fine
so
maybe
just
look
at
it
in
the
glass
and
then
go
get
something
better
to
drink
eh
this
just
hits
me
as
too
sickly
sweet
and
the
fact
of
that
makes
it
so
that
it
overpowers
anything
else
that
may
be
trying
to
show
so
its
a
one
act
show
with
a
strong
alcohol
and
boozy
tone
stepping
in
for
an
intermission
a
miss
in
my
book
overall
the
tastes
are
a
bit
heavy
and
sweet
for
the
style
not
really
a
fan
of
this
imperial
wit
style
although
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
asn
the
yeast
phenols
are
under
control
where
some
are
not
not
great
by
any
means
but
could
be
worse
concur
with
other
reviewers
about
nice
appearance
and
mouthfeel
i
drink
witbeer
routinely
but
in
this
case
the
cardamom
completely
overwhelms
everything
else
there
is
nothing
subtle
about
the
flavor
it
is
just
cardamom
i
found
it
nearly
undrinkable
and
returned
the
unused
bottles
not
one
of
their
better
efforts
i
have
a
feeling
this
is
a
pretty
old
bottle
but
at
10
3
it
should
hold
up
pretty
well
o
the
sweetness
and
alcohol
flavors
can
make
this
beer
a
bit
difficult
to
drink
that
this
beer
has
a
79
is
wrong
the
bros
need
to
review
this
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
witbier
a
decent
taste
but
a
little
too
syrupy
and
sweet
got
a
growler
of
this
limited
variety
and
finished
the
whole
thing
so
i
must
have
liked
it
well
enough
labelled
as
a
witbier
but
was
a
little
darker
than
most
and
certainly
stronger
and
bolder
than
you
would
expect
in
that
generally
lighter
style
more
like
a
belgian
ale
really
overall
a
solid
beer
that
is
more
of
a
sipper
than
a
session
i
think
i
liked
it
more
getting
it
in
a
growler
when
i
wasnt
expecting
to
get
anything
on
tap
good
and
solid
not
great
o
the
back
of
the
bottle
describes
in
aptly
pushes
the
boundaries
of
a
wit
style
could
have
been
more
but
as
my
first
imperial
white
i
like
and
appreciate
it
o
this
sounds
terribly
insulting
but
the
beer
was
great
till
i
actually
tasted
it
from
there
the
booziness
of
the
beer
just
made
it
difficult
to
drink
the
problem
isnt
that
the
abv
was
high
its
that
the
alcohol
wasnt
balanced
or
tamed
by
any
other
characteristics
poured
this
one
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
dark
golden
color
body
with
some
head
that
disappers
quickly
the
smell
is
on
the
sweet
side
with
some
citrus
coming
through
the
taste
is
very
bold
up
front
very
sweet
and
strong
of
banana
taste
i
really
dont
taste
any
of
the
spices
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thick
and
it
leaves
a
little
bit
of
a
after
taste
in
my
mouth
overall
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
way
to
sweet
for
my
likeing
bad
too
boozy
overall
while
on
the
sweeter
side
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
imperial
white
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
at
a
good
price
sam
does
a
wonderful
job
once
again
ad
i
would
recommend
this
brew
o
it
didnt
receive
overwhelmingly
strong
reviews
here
and
i
must
confess
i
still
havent
had
any
other
witbiers
but
this
is
an
good
beer
it
is
the
pale
version
of
an
imperial
stout
it
has
richness
and
delivery
perhaps
true
devotees
of
witbiers
take
exception
to
this
because
theyre
used
to
a
different
product
totally
understandable
maybe
this
is
average
for
a
witbier
and
granted
its
not
terribly
complex
or
sophisticated
but
it
is
a
helluva
lot
better
than
the
bmc
swill
out
there
smooth
rich
mouthfeel
with
fruity
notes
subtle
spicing
and
alcoholic
warmth
goes
down
easy
like
a
20
hooker
sorry
lol
the
finish
is
spicy
with
again
the
alcohol
flourish
one
of
my
top
wits
its
a
really
great
brew
for
pilsner
fans
looking
to
find
something
more
not
used
to
a
witbier
with
this
much
gas
original
review
on

an
overall
poor
showing
i
was
excited
when
i
found
this
at
the
store
because
i
had
never
seen
it
before
but
the
execution
here
is
not
very
good
doesnt
bring
the
wheat
flavor
as
promised
and
turns
out
to
be
quite
terrible
to
drink
overall
very
good
beer
i
have
enjoyed
this
on
several
occasions
tasting
the
beer
up
front
there
will
be
a
those
spice
and
coriander
notes
followed
by
honey
and
sweet
malt
flavors
in
the
middle
the
end
is
rounded
up
by
some
belgian
style
hops
but
the
sweet
notes
are
still
dominating
the
10
3
abv
are
well
hidden
an
interesting
beer
well
done
for
the
style
samuel
adams
is
the
most
consistent
american
brewer
they
try
so
many
things
and
they
never
seem
to
disappoint
this
beer
pours
a
beautiful
light
golden
color
with
a
hint
of
spice
and
a
light
cream
colored
head
the
beer
is
perfectly
carbonated
and
is
smooth
for
a
beer
with
ten
percent
alcohol
it
is
rather
sweet
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
easily
one
of
the
better
white
beers
i
have
tried
in
a
long
long
time
props
to
sam
adams
the
real
american
king
of
beers
o
gross
so
much
for
that
3
50
a
bottle
d
o
blue
moon
meet
your
big
brother
on
steroids
this
is
one
id
drink
again
a
big
taste
that
puts
you
in
a
mellow
zone
recommended
o
i
think
this
belongs
more
in
the
english
barleywine
category
than
the
wit
one
im
really
loving
this
and
wishing
i
hadnt
waited
so
damn
long
to
try
it
i
cant
wait
to
age
a
4pack
of
this
each
year
i
love
all
of
the
sam
adams
imperial
line
in
summary
memorable
for
a
wheatwine
power
chord
of
dried
apricots
this
is
a
decent
beer
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
most
of
the
flavors
are
typical
to
the
style
but
the
additional
malt
and
alcohol
add
depth
and
character
that
make
this
an
enjoyable
sipper
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
it
most
reminds
me
of
brooklyns
the
companion
but
this
has
a
lot
more
depth
of
flavor
and
better
mouthfeel
good
show
o
overall
this
would
be
an
excellent
beer
if
it
werent
for
the
overpowering
alcohol
maybe
aged
for
a
year
or
more
would
mellow
it
out
enough
for
the
malt
and
spices
to
shine
a
bit
more
o
interesting
take
on
the
style
i
found
it
a
potent
witbier
that
pushes
the
envelope
o
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
color
im
not
sure
whether
to
applaud
sam
adams
for
pushing
the
boundaries
on
a
witte
beer
or
to
totally
ding
it
because
it
resembles
nothing
close
to
the
style
i
hate
to
say
it
but
its
an
absolute
mess
give
me
a
whitewater
ipa
instead
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
enjoyed
the
way
it
felt
as
i
drank
wish
the
sweetness
were
toned
down
a
bit
though
this
one
pours
a
hazy
whiteorange
color
with
a
tiny
head
aroma
has
a
wheaty
citrus
aroma
along
with
a
fairly
high
amount
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
wheat
citrus
and
alcohol
its
not
terrible
but
the
style
just
probably
isnt
wellsuited
to
being
imperialised
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
and
wellcarbonated
and
the
drinkability
suffers
a
bit
its
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
id
probably
be
prone
to
having
again
overall
a
witbier
really
lets
put
that
aside
for
now
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
complex
all
around
floral
sweet
fruity
caramel
bready
tart
wow
10
3
abv
tastes
more
like
6
5
abv
intense
yet
pleasant
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
o
really
neat
that
this
beer
uses
no
caramel
malts
but
the
sheer
amount
of
2
row
makes
it
orangeish
too
boozy
missing
cloves
banana
and
bitter
orange
in
the
taste
sweetness
is
prevalent
though
wouldnt
buy
again
oh
well
i
had
to
try
it
an
ok
beer
overall
although
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
definitely
a
witbier
good
finish
though
hazy
deep
amber
with
thin
offwhite
head
noticeable
orangepeel
coriander
aroma
hoppy
fruit
bitterness
to
start
the
heavy
fruit
sourness
in
the
middle
is
a
turnoff
not
terrible
but
im
having
a
hard
time
wrapping
myself
around
this
one
this
isnt
what
i
expected
so
im
disappointed
seems
like
more
an
attempt
at
an
ipa
o
full
bodied
heavier
beer
noticeable
flavor
even
right
out
of
the
fridge
develops
nicely
as
beer
comes
to
room
temperature
this
ones
a
failure
doesnt
resemble
a
witbier
in
any
capacity
imperial
or
otherwise
othe
light
subtleness
of
a
witbier
is
missing
none
of
the
spices
and
wheat
flavors
are
present
also
the
alcohol
is
not
masked
well
at
all
o
not
the
best
sam
adams
on
the
market
way
to
sweet
and
way
to
boozy
for
me
nothing
like
the
complex
delicacies
found
in
your
standard
witbier
onot
a
fan
i
was
really
curious
when
i
saw
it
because
i
had
never
even
heard
of
an
imperial
witbier
being
done
luckily
it
was
pretty
cheap
but
sam
adams
definitely
did
not
create
a
unique
brew
here
or
at
least
not
in
a
good
way
overall
drinkability
as
a
witbier
i
cant
really
grade
this
beer
since
its
absolutely
not
a
witbier
for
being
an
imperial
wit
a
touch
of
citrus
is
present
feels
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
slight
alcohol
burn
and
overall
this
is
the
2nd
beer
from
the
imperial
series
that
i
have
tried

this
drinks
like
an
attempt
that
didnt
really
work
out
for
an
imperial
o
pretty
good
high
gravity
beer
for
a
decent
price
the
wife
even
approves
of
this
one
kinda
mixed
about
this
witbier
maybe
if
the
sweetness
was
toned
down
a
bit
i
would
have
given
it
a
higher
score
overall
i
would
recommend
it
ook
but
for
an
amped
up
white
a
beer
like
hoegarden
cru
tastes
truly
like
a
concentrated
version
of
hoegarden
this
is
a
completely
different
beerif
it
wasnt
for
the
orange
aroma
i
would
not
relate
it
to
a
witbier
the
oily
syrupy
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
a
little
offputting
for
me
but
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
wonder
how
it
will
age
had
a
single
in
my
fridge
and
drank
it
tonight
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
very
different
look
than
what
i
was
expecting
i
was
hoping
for
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
but
instead
i
got
a
clean
sunset
orange
color
not
bad
looking
just
different
looked
more
like
a
belgian
pale
ale
smell
was
sweet
but
in
a
cough
syrup
way
taste
was
pleasant
but
nothing
special
it
had
flavors
of
grapefruit
cotton
candy
and
lemon
zest
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thick
for
a
witbier
and
overly
sweet
on
the
palate
i
am
not
sure
why
they
want
to
showcase
this
style
of
beer
to
be
over
10
just
strange
and
i
am
not
sure
the
high
abv
helped
an
overall
odd
beer
that
i
am
happy
to
have
tried
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
again
a
complex
and
sturdy
ale
and
well
worthy
tasting
the
beer
up
front
there
will
be
a
those
spice
and
coriander
notes
followed
by

the

will
not

wont
actively

again
i
had
been

to
try
out
the
sam
adams
wee
heavy
but
now
i
fear
it
too
may
be
victim
to
the
same
unfortunate
tastes
o
much
bang
for
your

that

taste
heavy
on
the
sweet
sugar
makes
it
very
sticky
and
thick
the
taste
is
so
sugary
sweet
its
putting
my
eyes
in
the
back
of
my
head
heavy
on
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
a
big
sugarbang
very
tart
overall
i
had
some
trouble
with
this
one
i
couldnt
handle
the
sweet
it
seemed
artificial
and
syrupy
at
most
times
others
i
could
get
a
good
sip
i
could
afford
my
self
no
more
than
one
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
rule
it
out
overall
this
beer
definitely
pushes
the
boundaries
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
witbier
as
it
contains
all
of
the
flavors
regular
fans
of
the
style
expect
but
pushed
to
an
almost
inconceivable
extreme
this
beer
is
the
flipside
of
nuanced
no
doubt
this
will
have
a
polarizing
effect
some
thinking
the
result
fantastic
and
others
finding
it
too
powerful
personally
i
think
its
superb
overallgreat
tasting
beer
this
is
my
first
imperial
white
alewitbier
and
really
liked
it
prefer
this
over
their
dobblebock
and
imperial
stout
pours
a
semihazy
orangeish
hue
with
a
huge
fizzy
foamy
slight
off
white
head
aroma
is
full
of
orange
and
citrus
in
the
flavor
honey
orange
marmalade
lemon
and
suggestions
of
coriander
the
wheat
malt
base
and
orange
flavor
last
long
into
the
finish
the
10
3
alcohol
is
felt
but
barely
percievable
in
the
taste
just
a
hint
at
the
end
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
full
bodied
alittle
syrupy
not
bad
for
such
a
big
beer
overall
this
is
a
good
imperial
wit
strong
and
satisfying
o
not
again
please
thank
you
very
much
o
not
my
favourite
but
not
as
poor
as
i
feared
a
very
interesting
creation
and
a
worthy
one
at
that
recommended
even
if
i
wouldnt
want
another
anytime
soon
o
a
great
sam
adams
choice
pretty
bold
which
i
expected
from
this
imperial
series
flavorful
and
pretty
accurate
to
a
strong
belgian
wit
o
as
a
fan
of
both
big
beers
and
belgian
ales
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
beer
it
is
an
attempt
to
make
a
witbier
into
a
big
beer
and
i
think
it
is
quite
successful
that
being
said
it
wont
be
for
everyone
as
it
strays
quite
a
bit
from
the
typical
witbier
and
flavor
wise
it
isnt
what
one
would
normally
associate
with
big
beers
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
belgian
ales
and
big
beer
and
also
to
anyone
who
enjoys
an
experimental
beer
its
certainly
worth
trying
at
least
one
o
not
the
best
sam
adams
offering
i
have
had
but
it
is
above
10
which
is
pretty
sweet
o
the
worst
offering
from
sam
adams
ive
had
to
date
much
too
hot
and
sweet
without
any
complexity
and
completely
overwhelming
avoid
overall
i
really
enjoyed
downing
two
of
these
but
felt
as
though
it
lacked
a
little
carbonation
for
both
its
style
and
alcohol
level
a
solid
interpretation
of
an
imperial
wit
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
aging
it
is
an
amazing
thing
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
sampled
on
june
30
2011
it
pours
a
murky
hazy
copperamber
with
thin
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
loads
of
bubbly
carbonation
ascending
upward
when
i
check
out
the
aroma
my
first
thought
is
that
it
is
more
like
a
barleywine
than
a
witbier
with
its
sweet
caramel
maltiness
and
alcohol
bite
maybe
a
hint
of
spices
the
body
is
durable
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
clears
out
the
senses
due
to
that
10
abv
i
expect
but
otherwise
i
get
some
sweet
malts
and
thin
spices
and
a
whole
lot
of
punch
not
fruit
punch
i
am
referring
to
its
alcohol
nip
it
impresses
me
more
as
a
barleywine
rather
than
a
witbier
overall
overall
this
beer
was
too
sweet
for
me
i
enjoyed
every
single
sip
but
i
would
not
pick
up
this
beer
again
over
something
much
less
sweet
overall
a
nice
enough
beer
though
the
unusually
high
abv
for
a
wit
and
the
over
abundant
sweetness
impaired
my
enjoyment
very
sweet
and
somewhat
boozy
candied
orange
and
crystal
malt
reminds
me
more
of
a
faded
imperial
ipa
than
witbier
extra
sweet
and
caramelly
dry
prickly
finish
alcohol
is
way
too
forward
here
just
unapologetically
boozy
slick
and
syrupy
feel
high
gravity
largesse
it
coats
the
mouth
and
nearly
triggers
the
gag
reflex
thats
no
good
yuck
going
to
be
a
drainpour
for
the
last
bit
of
it
not
recommended
overall
i
find
this
brew
very
interesting
the
beer
does
not
remind
me
of
of
a
traditional
white
ale
but
it
is
certainly
worth
trying
to
me
it
is
just
a
great
american
twist
on
a
classic
style
this
pours
a
hazy
tan
with
a
good
head
i
see
yeast
and
other
particles
floating
around
from
the
looks
of
it
this
is
an
unfiltered
beer
the
head
retention
is
very
nice
and
has
a
mostly
white
color
the
smell
is
malty
and
wheat
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
not
bad
good
mouth
feel
the
alcohol
is
very
present
there
is
some
carbonation
its
a
medium
thickness
the
alcohol
burn
is
present
in
the
taste
more
so
than
i
normally
like
but
the
abv
is
high
i
dont
get
the
wheat
flavor
i
was
expecting
but
its
still
good
overall
a
decent
beer
although
not
quite
my
favorite
id
still
prefer
the
boston
lager
if
im
drinking
sam
adams
o
certainly
not
your
insert
random
relatives
title
heres
witbier
if
you
think
of
this
as
a
wit
you
might
not
enjoy
it
instead
think
of
it
as
some
crazy
big
beer
with
roots
leading
back
to
witbier
then
you
can
enjoy
it
for
the
unique
creation
it
is
d
this
beer
is
all
up
front
in
its
flavor
and
at
10
5
abv
i
wouldnt
do
more
than
1
o
pretty
good
overall
very
heavy
witbier
awesome
job
sam
adams
heavy
in
the
marty
mcfly
way
its
a
good
beer
its
got
the
makings
of
a
belgian
but
its
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
and
thats
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
something
from
belgium
with
the
10
3
alcohol
im
already
feeling
it
halfway
through
the
beer
the
flavors
are
great
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
a
little
too
sweet
o
not
bad
not
great
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
this
imperial
white
overall
this
beer
is
better
to
me
than
the
average
of
the
reviews
seems
to
be
i
think
its
solid
but
doesnt
necessarily
fit
the
style
but
style
be
damned
sa
typically
doesnt
let
me
down
and
this
isnt
an
exception
to
that
notion
i
think
one
is
plenty
overall
though
its
a
little
heavier
and
the
abv
kind
of
kicks
my
butt
its
overpriced
there
are
similar
good
quality
witbier
that
can
be
had
for
less
for
this
price
i
will
usually
want
to
get
real
german
bier
this
is
interesting
for
calling
itself
a
wit
but
not
bad
id
place
a
flavor
profile
like
this
in
a
belgian
strong
ale
genre
the
imperial
white
ale
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
three
that
came
out
in
this
series
i
thought
that
the
stout
and
bock
would
have
taken
the
crown
but
they
didnt
this
beer
pours
out
much
darker
orange
than
i
expected
it
to
for
being
a
white
ale
the
head
was
pretty
thick
looking
and
left
behind
some
good
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
the
typical
coriander
and
yeasty
citrus
aromas
along
with
some
spice
the
taste
translates
the
aroma
into
flavor
and
even
gives
off
some
floral
flavors
as
a
bonus
the
mouthfeel
is
much
thicker
than
expected
as
well
the
be
isnt
all
that
heavy
but
it
had
some
serious
body
to
it
overall
its
a
really
nice
brew
and
really
worth
looking
into
the
drinkability
is
there
for
me
in
moderation
this
is
no
lawnmower
wheat
this
is
a
sunset
deck
sittn
wheat
oh
ya
if
its
not
true
to
style
cause
its
to
strong
or
sweet
it
works
for
me
just
fine
the
coriander
and
orange
flavors
remain
intact
and
i
guess
the
wheat
does
too
but
i
have
a
hard
time
thinking
of
this
in
terms
of
wit
the
texture
is
honey
thick
and
tastes
almost
as
sweet
thick
drippy
booze
squeezes
this
one
like
an
anaconda
it
is
complex
and
quite
tasty
but
its
not
a
witbier
to
me
belgian
strong
pale
yes
an
interesting
experiment
worth
a
try
overall
even
though
this
is
listed
as
a
witbier
beware
this
is
not
your
typical
wit
i
actually
went
to
the
brewers
website
and
this
is
actually
explained
in
detail
that
the
brewers
intention
was
for
a
very
bold
strong
representation
of
the
style
well
they
did
and
then
some
i
truly
like
this
beer
but
i
dont
love
it
definitely
a
nitecap
definitely
not
a
sessionable
beer
this
is
for
sipping
and
my
recommendation
again
is
to
try
this
one
around
40
degrees
to
really
appreciate
the
complex
flavors
because
once
you
get
up
into
the
50s
this
becomes
a
sweet
syrupy
alcohol
bomb
i
will
purchase
this
again
but
know
what
your
getting
yourself
into
big
flavors
big
alcohol
and
a
big
buzz
youve
been
warned
in
a
good
way
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
that
is
very
rich
and
well
done
for
its
style
however
i
cant
say
its
definitely
something
ill
be
buying
again
this
poured
a
disconcertingly
bright
orange
with
a
heady
scent
of
sweet
wheat
and
didnt
get
much
better
i
found
it
overly
sweet
kind
of
like
a
chocolate
orange
had
been
dunked
in
eggnog
and
left
us
with
a
weirdly
cloying
mouthfeel
and
no
hop
bitterness
to
mention
actually
became
a
drain
pour
in
the
back
half
overall
a
little
too
extreme
of
an
interpretation
of
this
style
it
sacrifices
traditional
witbier
hallmarks
and
drinkability
and
for
booziness
and
heavier
body
notes
its
much
heavier
and
less
drinkable
than
a
normal
witt
beer
this
is
interesting
but
way
out
of
style
i
pass
on
this
in
the
future
o
overall
this
is
a
average
drinking
beer
the
alcohol
does
really
come
out
a
ton
and
for
that
it
makes
this
beer
a
little
unbearable
at
times
well
i
shouldnt
say
unbearable
but
just
average
overall
the
abv
is
a
little
high
making
this
a
one
and
done
drinker
do
very
light
and
drinkable
despite
all
of
the
flavor
this
is
rather
troubling
considering
the
alcohol
content
overall
it
is
a
very
good
beer
poured
clear
orange
with
yellow
hue
around
the
edge
fluffy
white
head
deminishes
quickly
light
lacing
orange
peel
and
coriander
spice
in
the
nose
with
lots
of
heat
from
the
alcohol
this
is
a
big
beer
and
a
huge
wit
thick
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
malted
caramel
bitter
orange
peel
spice
and
lots
of
alcohol
i
can
really
feel
it
on
the
exhale
this
is
an
interesting
take
on
a
wit
not
sure
of
the
aftertaste
clove
for
10
3
abv
it
goes
down
very
smooth
od
its
a
one
and
done
enjoyable
but
simply
too
heavy
for
a
wit
good
offering
by
sa
though
overall
i
think
this
beer
could
have
been
a
bit
more
subtle
it
is
a
white
after
all
mouthful
has
a
bit
of
a
creamy
touch
to
it
samuel
adams
imperial
white
was
amber
in
color
and
hazy
it
had
an
offwhite
head
with
decent
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
sweet
malt
and
fruit
the
taste
was
sweet
malt
fruit
and
spices
pepper
coriander
the
finish
was
fairly
dry
with
some
lingering
spice
and
throat
warming
alcohol
it
was
mediumfull
in
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
a
bit
creamy
this
is
a
tasty
beer
and
worth
a
try
o
cant
see
myself
drinking
too
many
of
these
due
to
the
high
abv
and
sweetness
this
is
a
strange
beer
in
a
blind
taste
test
i
would
have
never
guessed
this
was
a
wit
it
tasted
like
a
boozy
fruit
beer
you
cant
knock
them
for
pushing
the
envelope
but
this
does
not
taste
like
a
witibeir
i
would
drink
it
again
though
overall
a
solid
beer
but
perhaps
a
bit
to
sweet
the
first
thought
that
comes
to
mind
is
wheatwine
light
would
love
some
more
attenuation
or
complexity
o
solid
beer
and
can
have
one
in
a
sitting
even
with
the
high
abv
making
it
very
easy
to
return
to
this
beer
overall
i
think
the
imperial
white
ale
is
a
bit
much
but
still
a
good
dessert
beer
after
a
homemade
dinner
drink
up
d
great
drink
very
easy
to
drink
not
sure
why
it
was
given
such
a
low
score
but
this
definitely
stands
out
for
a
witbier
i
could
have
a
few
more
of
this
d
meh
i
will
not
have
this
again
it
is
a
train
wreck
of
a
beer
a
novelty
at
best
i
really
need
to
remention
the
tannins
in
this
beer
i
dunno
if
it
comes
from
the
hops
or
the
added
herbs
but
its
kinda
funky
in
a
not
flattering
way
overall
started
as
a
nice
tasty
brew
but
the
alcohol
basically
overpowered
the
rest
of
the
flavors
at
the
end
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
glass
the
beer
is
very
clear
with
a
very
nice
amber
look
there
was
very
little
to
no
head
a
very
nice
smell
with
a
strong
citrus
smell
i
taste
oranges
and
spice
in
the
beer
there
is
a
weird
gritty
feel
to
the
beer
over
all
the
beer
has
a
decent
amount
of
taste
and
would
pair
well
with
a
steak
cheers
drink
is
meh
quite
a
bit
of
booze
sticky
and
syrupy
weird
flavors
and
spices
meh
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
these
spicier
witbiers
are
more
interesting
to
me
ive
never
seen
an
imperial
white
before
and
now
i
know
why
its
a
cloudy
beer
with
a
spicy
nose
but
each
sip
establishes
an
expectation
that
i
never
taste
i
expect
this
beer
to
round
off
and
finish
with
coriander
cloves
and
citrus
instead
each
sip
finishes
boozy
and
stunts
my
taste
of
the
beers
spices
i
tried
drinking
each
bottle
differently
opened
and
poured
immediately
open
and
left
sitting
to
air
out
a
while
cooler
warmer
etc
but
each
time
the
booze
dominates
the
scene
normally
higher
abv
brews
dont
bother
me
id
rather
a
ris
over
a
stout
but
here
id
rather
have
a
witbier
over
this
imperial
one
maybe
let
this
cellar
a
few
months
and
see
whether
the
booze
figures
out
how
to
live
with
the
spices
drinkability
is
average
this
beer
lingers
for
a
while
so
one
beer
could
be
enjoyed
for
a
long
period
of
time
d
big
taste
big
price
big
on
alcohol
dont
have
more
than
a
couple
and
expect
to
taste
much
else
that
night
the
beer
pours
an
orange
color
with
a
decentsized
white
head
the
aroma
is
about
what
i
expected
i
get
a
lot
of
coriander
with
a
little
bit
of
orange
peel
to
balance
things
out
smells
like
a
regular
witbier
only
more
intense
the
flavor
is
similar
the
predominant
flavor
is
the
coriander
but
there
is
some
syrupy
sweet
orange
marmalade
notes
in
there
as
well
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
detectable
alcohol
easy
to
drink
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
imperial
whites
but
this
one
was
pretty
good
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
the
coriander
and
orange
which
is
what
i
look
for
in
a
witbier
imperial
or
otherwise
do
ive
had
this
a
few
times
in
the
past
but
theres
always
been
plenty
of
time
in
between
sessions
with
this
beer
thank
you
boston
beer
company
for
starting
the
imperial
series
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
lush
amount
of
carbonation
overall
not
for
the
weak
of
heart
this
is
very
boozy
im
going
to
put
a
bottle
away
for
a
year
or
two
and
then
revisit
it
i
have
a
feeling
age
with
help
this
one
remarkable
overall
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
nothing
special
and
i
generally
love
sam
beers
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
to
one
in
the
future
but
i
doubt
ill
ever
ask
for
one
specifically
an
extra
note
this
is
not
a
typical
white
beer
so
if
youre
looking
for
something
along
the
lines
of
allagash
white
harpoon
ufo
or
southamptons
double
white
this
beer
wont
fit
that
flavor
profile
for
a
second
sam
adams
boston
lager
has
always
tasted
salty
and
overpowering
to
me
its
never
been
a
drinkable
beer
for
me
but
if
you
happen
to
like
it
save
your
money
buying
this
overpriced
version
theres
nothing
special
here
i
dont
know
do
we
need
imperial
wit
ales
they
did
bock
and
stout
how
about
a
belgian
strong
or
ipa
or
dipa
instead
heavy
mouthfeel
good
for
one
or
two
but
certainly
not
any
more
than
that
verdict
probably
the
most
disappointing
samuel
adams
i
have
ever
had
the
obvious
marketing
tactic
in
this
beer
is
a
high
abv
as
the
beer
both
fails
to
make
any
sort
of
connection
to
the
witbier
style
and
instead
goes
for
power
and
wowfactor
through
alcohol
unfortunately
the
appearance
taste
and
mouthfeel
all
suffer
in
regards
to
the
audacity
of
this
move
and
the
end
result
seems
like
a
regular
old
samuel
adams
plus
liquor
to
create
a
beer
that
will
intoxicate
you
faster
and
with
less
drinks
if
thats
your
motive
for
enjoying
beer
get
it
but
be
wary
12
for
a
4
pack
of
any
beer
even
at
a
high
abv
for
the
sole
purpose
of
drinking
to
get
drunk
is
really
not
the
most
affordable
way
to
go
out
theres
cheaper
beer
for
people
that
enjoy
that
sensation
caseinpoint
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
avoid
d
2
4
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
i
will
buy
more
pours
a
dark
orange
head
dissipates
rather
quickly
mouthful
feels
like
alcohol
and
creamy
not
a
wit
by
any
means
d
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
would
be
easier
to
drink
if
it
was
a
little
less
sweet
and
had
less
of
a
booze
presence
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
necessarily
but
it
is
a
lot
different
than
i
thought
an
imperial
white
would
be
overall
its
a
decent
beer
i
would
try
again
if
some
one
else
buys
it
for
me
overall
not
my
type
of
beer
not
what
i
expect
a
witbier
to
be
overall
this
was
a
bad
release
i
have
to
say
it
is
just
too
hot
unbalanced
and
just
does
not
work
on
any
level
drinkability
unfortunately
this
was
not
what
i
was
expecting
probably
would
not
try
again
unless
someone
gave
me
one
disappointing
d
i
figured
i
would
try
a
4pack
as
i
am
a
fan
of
the
witbier
style
this
one
fell
far
short
from
enjoyment
in
my
book
ill
stick
with
my
hoegaarden
and
allagash
or
the
southampton
double
white
if
im
looking
for
a
higher
flavorabv
witbier
d
awful
thick
and
medicinal
with
a
booze
burn
after
having
infinium
for
new
years
last
week
i
cant
help
but
make
comparisons
with
this
beer
i
was
one
of
the
people
who
actually
enjoyed
infinium
and
found
this
to
have
similar
taste
and
nose
minus
the
butteryness
of
infinium
its
a
bit
darker
and
less
carbonated
but
other
than
that
they
are
very
similar
imo
i
know
this
was
made
before
infinium
so
it
seems
like
bbc
likes
to
use
many
of
the
same
ingredients
in
a
variety
of
their
beers
not
a
bad
thing
by
any
means
but
i
just
thought
it
was
interesting
that
this
and
infinium
by
my
tastes
of
course
tasted
so
similar
i
am
usually
impressed
with
sam
adams
products
this
one
leaves
me
hoping
it
gets
better
with
age
i
understand
now
why
this
is
the
first
imperial
white
beer
mass
produced
it
is
terrible
as
there
was
no
best
by
or
bottled
on
date
on
my
bottle
so
i
am
not
sure
how
old
it
was
and
that
may
have
had
an
unknown
effect
on
this
beer
the
beer
pours
a
thick
looking
orange
color
with
light
head
i
noticed
some
sort
of
solids
sink
to
the
bottom
of
my
beer
mildly
concerning
the
smell
is
very
boozy
some
orange
is
noticeable
the
first
sip
was
enough
for
me
to
know
i
wasnt
going
to
enjoy
this
but
continued
on
for
a
couple
more
to
at
least
get
the
experience
in
the
taste
the
citrus
shows
up
again
accompanied
by
some
coriander
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
big
and
heavy
overall
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
beer
i
poured
the
last
half
of
it
out
jim
kotch
this
was
a
noble
effort
but
i
dont
think
imperial
whites
were
a
style
that
was
meant
to
be
stored
at
a
constant
temperature
in
a
wine
cooler
since
purchase
pours
an
actively
carbonated
golden
amber
very
fine
protein
sediment
has
started
to
develop
and
is
suspended
throughout
a
thin
microbubbled
tannish
head
rings
slightly
around
the
glass
smell
is
ripe
white
grape
rich
lemon
and
herbs
taste
is
a
potpourri
sort
of
a
blend
of
sweet
and
sour
ale
bananas
and
wet
rich
grasses
the
feel
is
thick
like
a
heavy
white
wine
and
the
finish
is
sour
and
tart
as
well
as
boozy
and
a
bit
sugary
and
sticky
in
the
end
tho
a
sour
face
persists
drinkability
is
medium
but
this
is
a
heavy
beer
the
alcohol
was
obviously
present
and
tasted
like
vodka
had
been
added
to
the
beer
the
flavours
all
tasted
fake
and
added
and
i
literally
poured
it
down
the
drain
before
finishing
a
bottle
d
definitely
an
easy
drinker
for
the
high
abv
well
done
samuel
adams
there
seems
to
be
an
imperial
category
for
many
a
style
but
not
witbiers
which
you
would
think
makes
pretty
good
sense
that
is
until
you
run
headon
into
this
offering
from
the
bbc
confusion
with
this
acronym
only
exposes
ones
nonamerican
upbringing
here
12
oz
bottle
pours
hazy
amber
color
with
a
thick
white
lasting
head
aroma
is
of
yeast
fruit
and
wheat
malt
full
tangy
body
lots
of
fruit
on
the
palate
as
well
as
caramel
yeast
and
alcohol
long
sweet
fruity
finish
interesting
enjoyable
brew
i
was
curious
to
try
this
beer
coming
back
from
germany
having
been
hooked
on
german
white
as
opposed
to
nongerman
versions
starts
off
with
almost
a
syrupy
like
mouth
feel
but
is
a
very
consistent
and
smooth
taste
the
higher
abv
is
felt
towards
the
end
but
isnt
obvious
in
the
taste
and
results
in
a
very
well
balanced
beer
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
one
ill
get
again
though
maybe
not
recommended
drinking
it
with
a
slice
of
lemon
makes
a
big
difference
for
the
better
in
that
the
acidic
citrus
really
does
a
good
job
of
balancing
out
the
very
basic
mouthfeel
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
had
a
white
head
but
faded
fast
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
of
booze
and
licorice
the
taste
stars
out
with
a
weird
sweet
taste
but
is
boozy
all
the
way
through
the
sweetness
tastes
like
possibly
wheat
with
some
caramel
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
the
carbonation
is
low
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
i
guess
im
not
overall
impressed
with
this
one
i
remember
trying
this
one
when
it
first
came
out
and
strongly
disliking
it
figured
id
give
it
another
shot
after
developing
my
palate
i
hate
using
that
phrase
as
it
really
sounds
kinda
wine
or
anything
snobby
but
i
cant
easily
come
up
with
a
better
one
it
pours
a
hazy
clemsonauburn
why
should
auburn
be
the
only
tigerbased
school
with
a
color
hm
topped
by
a
shortlived
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
mandarin
oranges
lemon
zest
light
cardamom
and
light
toffee
unfortunately
for
these
elements
theyre
all
covered
by
a
thick
fog
of
mccormicks
vodka
plastic
bottle
and
all
sad
really
if
it
had
meshed
somewhat
nicely
like
a
strong
screwdriver
or
something
it
wouldve
been
fine
but
this
is
just
too
much
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
more
orange
this
time
round
moving
closer
to
a
peel
though
its
just
an
overly
boozy
mess
of
a
taste
just
like
the
smell
but
is
somehow
less
astringent
i
cant
explain
it
either
the
body
is
a
hefty
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sorta
sticky
feel
overall
this
is
just
too
much
for
what
it
might
even
want
to
be
the
booziness
is
so
omnipresent
and
malignant
that
i
really
dont
want
to
continue
drinking
this
very
much
much
less
get
any
more
bottles
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
color
with
yellow
hints
and
an
off
white
head
in
the
aroma
quite
spicy
cinnamon
dry
alcohol
kind
of
like
rubbing
alcohol
in
the
taste
orange
and
or
coriander
a
cinnamon
spice
and
dry
alcohol
all
the
way
through
a
smooth
and
medium
to
big
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dy
orange
citrus
and
spice
in
the
aftertaste
alcohol
is
too
big
kind
of
smells
of
rubbing
alcohol
or
like
hairspray
i
like
wits
quite
a
bit
noble
attempt
i
guess
but
i
just
dont
think
this
works
very
well
d
overall
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
i
could
see
enjoying
at
least
one
a
sitting
and
will
have
to
try
the
other
beers
on
the
imperial
line
drinkability
ehh
glad
i
got
only
a
single
i
like
the
other
two
sa
imperial
series
beers
but
this
one
missed
the
mark
in
my
opinion
very
boozy
and
thick
almost
too
much
to
drink
for
a
12oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
moderate
golden
color
with
a
white
head
nose
brings
a
lot
of
booze
and
some
stone
fruits
peaches
and
a
bit
of
banana
and
spice
the
taste
is
really
dominated
by
booze
with
some
slight
peach
flavors
in
the
background
feel
is
very
poor
nearing
on
awful
with
some
cloying
sugar
and
booze
way
too
thick
even
for
an
imperial
wheat
beer
much
thicker
and
more
boozy
than
the
typical
wheatwine
not
a
good
beer
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
despite
the
sweetness
and
higher
abv
vanilla
and
caramel
up
front
with
lots
of
orangetangerine
citrus
and
a
warm
boozy
finish
pretty
tasty
but
splitting
the
bottle
two
ways
turned
out
to
be
plenty
just
read
liquidbreads
review
looks
like
im
not
the
only
one
ew
d
for
me
this
is
not
drinkable
to
much
of
a
boozy
taste
for
me
but
its
hard
to
drink
for
me
didnt
really
care
for
this
beer
at
all
d
one
that
i
was
surprised
by
and
yet
another
just
like
dfh
90
minute
that
i
was
pretty
sad
about
once
i
finished
i
think
i
bought
the
last
one
in
the
store
time
to
bug
them
for
more
this
is
big
and
warming
before
finishing
my
glass
i
felt
the
need
to
remove
my
outer
shirt
first
beer
of
the
night
really
boozy
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
damn
is
this
thick
on
top
of
that
the
alcohol
isnt
really
that
disguised
i
dont
know
this
one
just
confuses
me
like
i
said
its
not
bad
but
neither
is
it
a
must
try
sam
adams
imperial
white
pours
a
beautiful
dark
amber
color
with
a
nicely
delayed
head
of
foam
as
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
the
taste
is
interesting
it
seems
to
start
out
bitter
only
to
diminish
quickly
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
is
that
it
seems
to
have
a
sort
of
cotten
candy
effect
something
new
to
try
but
at
full
price
probably
not
a
regular
drinking
beer
this
is
a
little
out
of
guidelines
for
a
witbier
to
me
along
with
the
extremely
high
abv
characteristics
are
that
more
of
a
trappist
ale
pours
a
caramel
bronze
into
a
pint
glass
odors
of
orange
but
also
somewhat
unfortunately
alcohol
and
what
my
wife
calls
sharpie
marker
you
can
definitely
taste
the
orange
belgian
spices
but
the
alcohol
is
also
extremely
prevalent
it
has
a
very
thick
mouthfeel
almost
syrupy
overall
i
like
this
beer
but
its
a
bit
too
powerful
for
my
tastes
i
could
never
drink
more
than
one
even
if
i
had
the
desire
to
do
so
almost
like
drinking
a
shot
the
appearance
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
however
the
aroma
is
intoxicating
the
most
wonderful
taste
going
i
cant
quite
place
it
but
it
is
very
good
just
the
rite
consistency
and
feel
i
could
keep
drinking
these
all
nite
pours
a
hazy
amber
with
no
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
with
banana
and
caramel
tastes
of
spicy
coriander
yeast
banana
white
pepper
and
cream
very
long
finish
and
slightly
sweet
a
little
too
sweet
and
stodgy
in
the
mouth
particularly
for
any
species
of
wit
a
pleasant
enough
beer
which
although
spiced
like
a
wit
doesnt
give
me
the
feeling
at
all
of
drinking
a
wit
the
extra
malt
it
took
to
get
the
beer
up
to
imperial
strength
pretty
much
eliminated
the
crisp
citrusy
pleasures
of
a
wit
and
created
something
else
entirely
somewhere
farther
along
the
spectrum
toward
a
dunkleweiss
at
least
as
far
as
flavor
and
mouthfeel
goes
still
not
bad
just
not
wit
like
in
the
least
other
than
the
additives
dnotes
i
wasnt
expecting
this
not
much
like
a
wit
but
this
beer
tastes
pretty
good
a
little
too
thick
on
the
mouthfeel
second
sam
adams
imperial
i
have
tried
i
think
theyre
gross
i
will
shy
away
from
the
others
d
nice
upfront
malts
and
spice
with
quite
a
hot
finish
that
make
it
hard
to
finish
a
good
warmer
in
a
cold
day
this
beer
while
not
a
true
wit
is
very
good
seems
wit
is
a
bit
of
a
stretch
for
this
one
seems
more
like
a
belgian
spiced
ale
type
of
beer
it
doesnt
detract
tho
it
only
makes
me
question
the
style
a
bit
if
it
had
been
listed
as
a
belgian
i
wouldnt
have
thought
twice
dit
is
to
good
found
myself
drinking
a
few
quicker
then
i
should
and
the
high
octane
of
this
brew
hit
me
hard
20
proof
shouldnt
be
this
easy
to
drink
when
its
cooled
below
fridge
temp
it
takes
on
this
amazing
somewhat
viscous
cloudy
and
sparkling
amber
texture
unlike
any
other
beer
ive
seen
nice
thickness
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
drinkable
if
you
can
get
over
the
sweetness
the
first
three
sips
are
quite
interesting
it
has
a
intense
syrup
of
grit
and
bit
of
honey
malt
i
can
tell
there
is
some
wheat
that
has
gone
turbid
although
this
does
have
a
floral
barley
wine
quality
its
acidic
quality
seems
more
like
something
that
is
over
fortified
as
does
the
bite
its
acuatually
has
a
similar
to
a
braggot
in
palate
from
outside
of
smoothness
of
mouthfeel
the
mouthfeel
is
cold
tablet
like
to
be
honest
this
beer
is
good
but
for
me
is
better
suited
drinking
on
a
cold
day
than
a
humid
july
night
this
is
a
fine
witbier
that
pushes
the
envelope
a
departure
from
the
style
in
some
ways
it
almost
takes
on
the
character
of
a
strong
red
ale
more
for
sipping
after
a
good
meal
than
refreshing
taste
is
very
good
i
am
a
fan
of
belgian
style
ales
and
that
is
what
this
is
proper
glassware
is
important
it
is
not
a
whitewit
it
is
sweet
and
as
it
warms
it
is
boozy
10
to
me
it
tasted
more
like
a
good
belgian
quad
i
will
add
this
to
the
stock
of
my
beer
fridge
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
goblet
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
head
and
moderate
lacing
so
far
so
good
the
nose
is
fruity
boozy
and
malty
with
some
spice
evident
taste
simply
put
not
good
a
wellintentioned
brew
that
falls
flat
too
boozy
too
sweet
tried
to
like
it
esp
considering
its
cost
but
ended
up
a
drain
pour
not
for
me
ive
put
off
picking
this
beer
up
for
some
time
but
am
glad
to
have
finally
tried
it
and
may
pick
it
up
again
d
this
is
a
huge
beer
meant
for
sipping
but
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
despite
the
obviously
high
alcohol
content
notes
nice
offering
from
these
imperial
series
closer
to
an
wheatwinestrong
belgian
ale
interpretation
of
a
witbier
more
than
anything
else
it
remains
intriguingly
drinkable
but
there
is
little
if
anything
about
the
boundaries
of
a
witbier
like
the
brewer
suggests
beautiful
cloudy
light
amber
smelling
slightly
of
citrus
tastes
like
a
traditional
witbier
up
front
citrus
and
wheat
but
with
a
stronger
bite
the
high
alcohol
content
is
very
well
hidden
so
beware
still
tastes
smooth
on
the
back
end
but
i
began
to
taste
the
alcohol
a
little
more
overall
another
good
beer
from
sam
adams
md
a
bit
thicker
than
i
was
expecting
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
not
completely
undrinkable
i
would
have
to
agree
with
the
label
on
this
brew
it
is
not
a
standard
witbier
and
should
have
its
own
category
that
said
the
alcohol
needs
to
be
masked
better
in
this
brew
ive
had
stronger
stuff
done
better
in
that
aspect
d
overall
its
a
good
beer
but
thats
about
all
i
will
give
it
it
could
be
a
little
better
and
the
flavors
in
my
opinion
arent
very
well
mixed
together
it
seems
like
this
beer
still
isnt
quite
sure
what
it
wants
to
be
d
a
little
much
for
what
tends
to
be
a
more
drinkable
style
as
heavy
beers
go
kind
of
a
challenge
but
what
do
you
expect
d
i
didnt
think
this
was
one
of
the
easier
beers
to
drink
nothing
in
this
brew
really
felt
balanced
i
guess
some
styles
arent
meant
to
be
doubled
and
imperial
mouthfeel
was
fairly
heavy
sweet
i
thought
this
was
ok
just
not
at
all
fitting
with
the
expected
style
maybe
i
was
just
in
the
mood
for
this
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
more
than
what
most
of
the
people
i
was
with
thought
of
it
while
perhaps
not
the
truest
to
style
of
sam
brews
this
is
surely
the
most
interesting
thing
to
come
out
of
this
brewery
in
a
long
time
drinkability
i
appreciate
what
boston
beer
company
is
trying
to
do
here
it
gets
my
applause
but
after
tasting
it
i
said
to
myself
was
it
really
necessary
to
put
this
one
out
for
public
consumption
its
an
interesting
brew
but
a
fourpack
among
friends
is
about
all
i
need
ever
a
true
sipping
beer
this
beer
does
not
push
out
the
boundaries
of
a
witbier
it
crosses
the
boundaries

summary
i
think
this
beer
is
worth
sampling
obviously
stronger
than
the
standard
wit
but
pulled
off
very
nicely
i
wouldnt
want
too
many
of
these
but
to
just
slowly
enjoy
one
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
on
special
occasions
specially
during
colder
months

5this
is
an
interesting
specimen
worth
a
try
for
fans
of
witbiers
because
it
gives
a
pretty
swift
middle
finger
to
tradition
and
all
i
really
care
about
is
whats
actually
in
the
glass
between
this
and
noble
pils
but
its
minimal
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
thick
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
its
not
as
spicy
as
a
traditional
white
ale
it
borders
on
wheat
wine
territory
it
goes
down
smooth
with
a
bit
of
heat
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
full
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
im
not
overly
impressed
citrus
and
banana
like
esters
it
is
not
as
hopped
as
one
would
imagine
it
has
a
wonderful
citrus
flavor
it
has
a
smooth
and
full
body

but
not
the
sort
of

with

or
some
appetizers
like
light
cheeses

witbiers
have

quenching
beers
perfect
to

on
a
warm
summers
day
imperial
white
is
just
kind
of
a
syrupy
overall
i
actually
enjoyed
the
original
white
over
this
i
drank
them
sidebyside
it
was
a
lot
easier
to
drink
and
more
enjoyable
than
this
i
really
was
looking
forward
to
trying
this
beer
but
i
think
sa
went
in
the
wrong
direction
here
d
easy
to
drink
not
what
i
envisioned
at
all
but
an
enjoyable
beer
with
decent
balance
if
youre
expecting
a
sweet
malty
beer
with
high
abv
cloudy
orange
amber
color
makes
the
pour
look
a
lot
like
honey
and
the
head
atop
is
small
the
smell
is
that
of
coriander
orange
peel
and
banana
and
it
is
quite
strongly
scented
too
the
taste
is
definitely
several
notches
above
a
typical
wit
and
the
concentrated
phenols
rush
in
rapidly
to
form
a
barrage
of
clove
white
pepper
banana
puree
and
apple
skins
surprising
the
taste
is
very
short
lived
as
the
alcohol
immediately
dries
the
palette
leaving
a
warm
but
vacuous
aftertaste
with
a
ghostly
spiciness
needless
to
say
the
next
sip
is
necessary
due
to
these
parched
throat
conditions
definitely
different
than
a
typical
wit
and
probably
closer
to
a
wheat
wine
than
anything
else
i
am
glad
boston
brewing
company
is
still
experimenting
drinkability
this
is
very
sweet
too
sweet
i
am
turned
off
by
the
sweet
syrupy
thickness
to
it
nothing
too
over
the
top
flavor
wise
but
the
alchohol
is
still
present
even
with
all
of
the
sweet
sugary
flavor
and
spices
drinkability
an
overall
good
beer
but
to
me
a
tad
sweet
from
what
i
usually
would
be
looking
for
in
a
white
beer
couldnt
myself
in
anyway
have
more
then
one
of
these
in
a
nite
just
to
much
sugar
and
sweetness
mixed
with
such
a
high
alcohol
level
this
one
would
knock
you
on
your
butt
and
you
would
never
see
it
coming
worth
a
try
as
its
pretty
unique
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
tripel
than
a
witbier
but
even
looking
at
it
that
way
its
still
terrible
ive
never
seen
an
imperial
white
so
i
had
to
buy
it
10
99
for
a
four
pack
my
bottle
says
10
3
alcohol
as
opposed
to
the
9
listed
above
its
the
color
of
an
old
worn
penny
and
has
a
dense
and
creamy
vanillacolored
head
opaque
too
not
too
easy
to
see
through
fruity
and
spiced
aroma
the
bottle
says
orange
and
corriander
and
id
say
thats
an
accurate
description
its
heavier
than
any
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
thick
and
syrupy
with
a
large
amount
of
alcohol
warmth
grainy
earthy
bittersweet
and
spiced
lingering
sort
of
sour
aftertaste
lots
of
different
flavors
some
good
some
not
so
good
lots
of
alcohol
warmth
it
feels
like
im
drinking
wine
this
is
a
slowsipper
not
to
be
drank
in
large
quantities
this
is
a
sipper
brew
and
really
should
be
mor
refreshing
with
a
nice
complex
yeast
for
complexity
but
its
all
malt
and
juicy
fruit
overall
a
detached
brute
of
its
parental
beer
style
im
all
for
pushing
the
boundaries
i
e
devil
dancer
bells
batch
beers
etc
but
this
really
doesnt
work
for
me
wheat
malt
is
probably
my
favorite
malt
used
for
beer
hopefully
the
wheat
malt
allocated
for
this
beer
could
be
used
for
another
prototype
i
compare
this
severe
deviation
of
a
traditionally
delicate
beer
to
slayer
singing
my
children
a
bedtime
lullaby
strong
smell
of
bananas
and
apricots
in
the
nose
and
a
big
spice
hit
on
the
tongue
strong
hints
of
cloves
coriander
and
a
vaguely
peppery
thing
in
the
background
i
think
they
might
have
tried
a
little
too
hard
with
this
one
its
too
sweet
and
cloying
for
my
taste
a
bit
thin
in
both
the
finish
and
the
body
i
dont
care
for
it
too
much
disclaimer
wheats
whites
and
hefeweizens
arent
the
sort
of
beer
i
like
to
drink
but
they
are
beer
and
i
feel
i
should
give
them
a
fair
crack
of
the
whip
and
be
as
impartial
as
i
can
oh
and
my
bottle
says
10
3
abv
not
the
9
listed
here
on
ba
was
this
a
different
recipe
or
not
full
thick
body
light
carbonation
very
drying
this
is
my
second
sa
imperial
series
the
stout
had
the
same
ultra
alcohol
burst
problem
too
one
more
to
go
it
appears
tastes
very
much
as
its
aroma
indicated
starts
off
like
a
heavy
witbier
and
thats
really
nice
but
this
quickly
gets
consumed
by
an
assload
of
hellertau
nearly
unpleasant
and
then
some
strong
alcohol
burn
at
the
end
not
bad
especially
considering
how
unique
it
is
but
really
not
good
kind
of
sweet
taste
is
a
little
much
for
an
otherwise
pretty
good
beer
d
one
big
bad
motha
cant
sit
here
and
pound
these
all
night
but
hell
theres
so
much
flavor
that
one
can
disappear
pretty
quick
all
the
wheat
provides
a
luscious
body
but
other
than
that
it
just
seems
like
a
different
style
of
big
belgian
beer
considering
the
added
spices
arent
that
noticeable
still
overall
its
an
attractive
delicious
beer
worthy
of
a
chalice
or
tulip
this
is
a
dynamite
beer
very
imperial
and
very
complex
a
sipper
but
i
could
handle
a
couple
or
more
at
one
sitting
as
it
continues
to
excite
the
more
you
drink
it
great
stuff
a
thick
and
consistent
tan
head
covers
a
hazy
reddishorange
brew
a
nice
stripe
of
lacing
is
left
behind
a
big
whiff
of
coriander
mixed
with
sweet
malts
is
noticed
at
first
some
sugar
grapefruit
rind
and
beer
bread
also
exist
tastes
super
sweet
up
front
with
some
spice
subtle
hops
and
huge
malts
all
working
their
way
into
the
experience
also
very
sugary
and
bready
with
some
sourness
and
alcohol
heat
figuring
into
the
end
intense
at
first
until
all
the
elements
begin
to
separate
and
become
discernible
on
their
own
its
well
carbonated
with
a
medium
mouthfeel
a
very
unique
beer
maybe
too
much
so
ive
had
a
few
imperial
wits
before
sam
adams
does
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
one
it
just
feels
heavier
than
the
other
big
wits
ive
had
before
new
glarus
bells
batch
8000
and
not
as
much
banana
as
id
like
still
a
pretty
good
beer
ps
the
glass
is
great
too
d
this
is
quite
possibly
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
it
really
is
finely
crafted
with
great
aroma
and
flavor
poured
into
my
pint
glass
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
this
beer
pours
a
sort
of
hazy
dark
goldmedium
copper
color
white
head
is
about
an
inch
when
poured
settling
to
a
nice
thick
ring
lining
the
inside
of
the
glass
and
a
thin
surface
coating
nice
lacing
has
a
floral
sort
of
fruity
tang
aroma
with
orange
and
coriander
spice
sweet
malty
taste
along
with
the
aforementioned
coriander
spice
and
fairly
sweet
tangy
citrus
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
and
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
rounding
out
the
taste
the
sweet
orange
flavors
do
tend
to
dominate
especially
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
it
does
end
up
being
a
little
bit
too
much
for
my
taste
i
hope
it
mellows
out
a
bit
with
age
as
i
am
aging
one
of
these
in
my
cellar
has
a
crisp
medium
to
full
bodied
mouthfeel
with
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
easy
to
drink
a
good
effort
here
overall
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
a
booze
laden
syrup
honestly
this
beer
is
awful
sometimes
you
have
to
strike
out
to
hit
a
home
run
this
was
definately
an
example
of
swinging
for
the
fences
and
striking
out
d
this
is
a
big
beer
with
some
spice
and
plenty
of
heat
but
there
isnt
much
depth
or
balance
i
dont
know
what
age
would
do
to
this
but
without
the
alcohol
heat
there
would
be
much
character
left
this
beer
is
horid
stale
bubblegum
and
rotting
bananas
did
i
mention
that
sam
adams
three
weis
men
the
one
off
weisbock
from
a
few
years
ago
was
stellar
this
however
is
shit
hands
down
the
worst
sam
adams
product
ive
ever
had
poured
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
head
that
was
only
about
a
finger
high
but
quite
thick
this
head
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
left
plenty
of
lacing
as
far
as
scent
i
got
a
combo
of
juicy
fruit
and
allspice
at
10
3
abv
my
fears
of
overt
sweetness
were
confirmed
im
guessing
this
is
unavoidable
pumping
the
alcohol
up
this
high
on
this
style
of
beer
i
do
kinda
like
this
brew
it
is
just
too
rich
and
sweet
for
me
to
have
more
than
one
in
fact
i
would
prefer
this
to
be
bottled
as
6
8
ouncers
rather
than
4
12
ouncers
this
would
be
a
nice
dessert
beer
or
even
a
winter
beer
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
purchased
a
sam
adams
brew
and
this
introduction
to
their
imperial
series
did
not
disappoint
the
imperial
white
pours
a
hazy
semidark
orange
color
with
a
nice
head
the
bavarian
ring
rims
the
glass
nicely
foam
in
the
middle
thins
a
bit
as
id
expect
in
a
witbeir
but
doesnt
disippate
which
is
nice
smell
is
nice
but
understated
the
signature
sam
adams
spice
is
present
in
the
nose
as
is
a
light
hint
of
orange
and
wheat
undertones
the
taste
is
very
good
i
get
an
alcoholy
malty
taste
with
a
subtle
orange
wheat
flavor
very
very
nice
mouthfeel
is
just
as
promised
on
the
package
warm
smooth
light
spice
suprisingly
light
overall
mouthfeel
given
the
abv
drinkability
is
scary
a
dangerously
drinkable
big
beer
so
beware
a
great
take
on
a
the
classic
witbier
style
i
liked
their
imperial
stout
better
murky
and
cloudy
scarlet
red
thin
bubbly
white
head
lacing
is
quite
full
aroma
is
inviting
fresh
smells
of
yeast
and
baked
bread
and
lavander
a
little
orange
coriander
too
interesting
concoction
they
really
stepped
it
up
this
year
tipping
the
scales
at
10
3
av
mighty
hefty
for
a
witbier
mouhtfeel
is
a
little
syrupy
and
a
bit
alcoholic
though
not
overly
so
surprisingly
overall
impression
is
sweet
and
spicy
and
syrupy
sticky
sweet
sugary
sweet
with
cinnamon
and
pepper
spicing
body
is
full
this
beer
has
a
cough
medicine
feel
to
it
though
its
not
as
bad
as
that
sounds
this
is
just
a
little
unbalance
and
maybe
just
a
little
too
big
for
this
style
blech
had
higher
hopes
for
this
stuff
bought
a
single
at
goldsteins
in
kingston
pa
poured
into
a
hoegaarden
glass
hey
its
a
white
right
first
sniff
real
boozy
and
not
pleasant
taste
very
sweet
but
too
boozy
not
a
chugger
very
disappointed
who
knows
though
it
may
have
been
skunked
sitting
in
a
singles
shop
this
beer
pours
with
a
golden
yellow
color
and
is
a
little
bit
cloudy
the
smell
is
very
floral
the
taste
is
lighter
than
i
expected
there
is
a
lite
hoppy
taste
but
you
taste
the
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
carbinated
you
can
feel
the
carbination
if
you
leave
the
drink
in
your
mouth
overall
however
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
was
very
surprised
how
smooth
and
light
it
was
based
on
the
higher
alcohol
content
mouthfeel
velvety
the
carbonation
is
there
but
there
is
a
heaviness
to
this
beer
that
stands
out
very
nice
d
a
worthy
effort
not
a
beer
i
would
seek
out
but
worth
a
shot
poured
a
medium
orangeamber
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
whtie
head
aromas
of
citrus
mainly
oranges
coriander
some
wheat
and
caramel
tastes
of
citrus
the
same
oranges
wheat
sugary
sweet
and
caramel
sweet
with
some
alcohol
in
the
finish
dont
drink
and
review
d
i
didnt
even
want
to
finish
this
one
glass
but
i
did
makes
me
happy
i
only
bought
a
single
and
not
a
4
pack
drinkability
good
be
careful
plenty
of
alcohol
with
this
one
you
will
enjoy
but
do
not
drink
more
than
one
or
two
in
a
session
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
of
samuel
adams
best
i
highly
recommend
it
seek
it
out
overall
this
is
a
strange
beer
i
dont
know
if
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
pours
murky
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
aroma
is
very
sweet
with
notes
of
caramel
and
light
fruit
apples
perhaps
also
just
a
bit
of
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
nose
taste
is
also
very
sweet
again
with
some
light
fruit
notes
alcohol
is
noticeable
in
the
finish
full
bodied
and
nicely
carbonated
not
really
a
witbier
at
all
this
is
an
unique
and
extreme
beer
definitely
a
sipper
and
not
something
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
the
beer
pours
with
a
dark
hazy
amber
appearance
lacing
is
really
patchy
and
the
head
thins
out
way
too
fast
aromas
are
wicked
rich
with
vanilla
malts
very
ripe
orange
tastes
have
a
lightly
complex
almost
syrupy
hint
to
them
very
sweet
with
a
thin
bitter
aftertaste
malts
are
heavy
and
overpower
any
citrus
flavoring
i
could
properly
sense
overall
an
interesting
drink
from
sam
adams
no
real
carbonation
to
lighten
things
up
the
syrupiness
is
unpleasant
this
is
pretty
damn
bad
i
think
its
syrupy
sugariness
may
have
given
me
a
cavity
on
the
plus
side
it
seems
to
be
attracting
butterflies
and
hummingbirds
who
unfortunately
become
insanely
drunk
from
the
overwhelming
alcohol
i
love
sas
white
ale
but
this
stuff
is
brutal
dotson
this
poured
a
hazy
dark
gold
with
white
head
it
smelled
like
lemon
hops
and
creamy
yeast
with
caramel
malt
and
fresh
wheat
it
tasted
like
peach
hops
and
sour
but
creamy
yeast
with
lots
of
caramel
and
barley
malt
and
a
bit
of
orange
it
was
quite
thick
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
and
had
a
bittersour
aftertaste
overall
this
was
actually
pretty
nice
which
was
surprising
because
i
dont
typically
like
witbiers
that
much
perhaps
my
palate
has
just
evolved
either
way
this
beer
had
good
flavor
and
huge
body
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
fun
and
enjoyable
especially
for
a
warmer
day
d
for
a
9
beer
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
not
nearly
as
drinkable
as
a
real
wit
and
not
an
improvement
on
the
overall
style
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
one
i
dont
think
this
is
really
a
style
meant
to
be
imperialized
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
prime
example
of
why
certain
types
of
beer
shouldnt
push
the
abv
too
high
i
thought
an
amped
up
version
of
sams
white
ale
would
be
pretty
good
but
i
was
proven
wrong
overall
a
drain
pour
avoid
one
and
so
done
enough
with
the
imperial
wits
overall
this
is
a
beer
to
try
a
time
or
two
as
a
sipper
but
not
anything
i
would
want
to
have
often
or
more
than
one
if
this
was
not
my
first
beer
of
the
night
it
would
be
a
probably
drain
pour
it
is
a
real
effort
to
choke
it
down
just
too
much
leftover
sweetness
to
make
this
a
winner
i
doubt
i
will
buy
another
bottle
until
i
can
confirm
a
new
batch
is
out
i
dont
care
for
this
one
at
all
d
i
like
this
beer
but
would
be
way
better
suited
for
a
midwinters
night
with
the
snow
falling
and
the
wind
howling
i
just
got
in
from
working
in
the
yard
and
while
it
is
only
55
outside
im
having
a
real
tough
time
getting
thru
this
beer
if
it
was
offered
in
the
winter
id
buy
it
not
sure
if
this
is
what
i
want
in
spring
d
a
nice
attempt
but
the
few
other
imperial
wits
i
have
had
have
hid
the
alcohol
much
better
in
this
one
it
tends
to
dominate
the
drink
theres
just
not
enough
malt
to
hold
back
the
10
3
but
in
the
end
it
wasnt
a
hard
beer
to
finish
was
a
bit
disappointed
by
this
beer
didnt
really
taste
any
witbier
characteristics
and
it
was
a
little
too
alcoholic
honesty
tasted
like
a
mediocre
duvel
drinkability
i
think
it
too
strong
for
a
wit
when
i
think
of
wit
i
think
og
hot
day
in
the
spring
or
summer
is
kind
a
a
strong
but
i
dug
it
d
surprisingly
pretty
easy
drinking
considering
how
unwitbierlike
this
is
pretty
unnecessary
first
i
must
say
its
like
no
witbier
i
have
ever
had
but
not
to
be
taken
in
a
bad
way
taste
is
more
like
a
mild
barleywine
with
that
same
warm
alcohol
taste
looks
like
unfiltered
cider
when
poured
with
a
short
beige
head
and
a
nice
sticky
lace
that
holds
past
the
finish
smells
of
fresh
banana
bread
and
mild
hint
of
alcohol
very
sweet
and
fruity
taste
with
a
lightly
slick
mouthfeel
drinkability
witbier
no
something
else
mild
barleywire
yes
rather
than
an
imperial
witbier
this
could
easily
be
considered
a
barleywine
with
a
witbier
influence
interesting
nonetheless
d
id
say
that
sam
adams
did
about
as
good
a
job
as
could
have
been
done
but
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
theres
no
justification
for
this
beer
to
have
been
created
not
every
style
needs
to
be
embiggened
as
jebediah
springfield
would
say
as
a
witbier
its
not
very
good
but
as
a
generic
belgian
strong
ale
its
pretty
decent
notes
the
smooth
feeling
when
it
goes
down
struggles
with
balancing
of
the
malts
it
was
filling
and
really
for
me
it
was
a
sugar
bomb
not
something
to
look
for
in
my
opinion
the
brew
has
fine
carbonation
a
fullish
body
and
imparts
a
little
slickness
as
it
passes
through
my
mouth
not
a
terrible
drinker
but
not
at
all
quaffable
either
an
interesting
brew
ill
call
it
this
big
sipper
of
a
witbier
but
interesting
can
mean
just
about
anything
cant
it
thin
finish
not
the
creamy
lingering
sweetness
i
was
looking
for
as
my
7th
grade
french
teacher
said
bof
had
this
on
tap
at
carrabas
at
perimeter
in
north
atlanta
served
in
a
chilled
pilsner
glass
pours
a
generally
yellow
color
with
a
minimal
head
smell
is
generally
citrusy
taste
is
citrus
and
bready
taste
is
somewhat
subdued
moderate
carbonation
i
dont
know
if
this
was
the
best
environment
for
this
beer
the
glass
was
chilled
and
the
beer
may
have
been
served
too
cold
i
tried
to
warm
it
but
even
so
the
beer
was
just
ok
verdict
interesting
beer
but
just
way
too
sweet
for
me
wits
are
usually
crisp
light
and
refreshing
and
this
is
like
drinking
a
10
orange
bang
fantastic
beer
that
is
very
witlike
in
the
nose
but
the
flavors
scream
imperial
this
is
a
great
beer
thank
you
jim
koch
drinkability
too
sweet
and
boozy
not
very
drinkable
especially
for
a
white
the
alcohol
isnt
merely
unmasked
its
prominent
and
overpowering
good
drinkability
with
respect
to
the
alcohol
hands
down
the
best
witbier
style
beer
ive
had
whats
wrong
with
extreme
its
beautiful
d
the
alcohol
is
too
strong
to
make
this
drinkable
the
high
abv
makes
this
somewhat
of
a
sipper
but
this
is
more
than
worthy
thus
far
it
just
may
be
my
favorite
from
sams
imperial
series
and
my
favorite
witbier
its
a
jackedup
sensational
offering
very
fine
pours
a
medium
brown
with
a
tan
head
nice
looking
bale
but
in
no
way
resembles
a
witbier
nose
has
wheat
malts
citrus
fruits
subtle
hops
alcohol
and
herbs
the
taste
is
also
quite
sweet
with
an
unbalanced
alohol
presence
and
various
summer
spices
medium
body
is
poorly
carbonated
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
my
idea
of
a
witbier
still
enjoyable
about
what
i
expect
from
sam
adams
overall
a
dissapointing
attempt
at
an
innovative
style
try
making
it
a
little
smaller
next
time
nothing
in
this
beer
says
witbier
to
me
its
hopefully
one
of
the
last
make
this
bitch
as
strong
as
we
can
beers
no
wit
no
nothing
good
ive
had
dfhs
red
white
and
at
10
it
is
much
better
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
an
imperial
wit
i
thought
the
flavor
was
very
balanced
and
smooth
alcohol
comes
on
a
little
hot
but
i
felt
it
brought
out
a
nice
counterpoint
to
the
broad
range
of
sweet
fruit
notes
spice
has
a
subtle
understated
presence
pretty
good
stuff
drinkability
i
am
not
really
impressed
with
this
beer
what
is
the
point
ordinary
witbiers
are
both
more
interesting
and
more
refreshing
this
tastes
like
a
notsogood
version
of
chimay
red
disappointing
bottled
twelve
ounce
dark
orange
colored
ale
with
a
large
creamy
white
head
nose
is
strange
very
sweet
fruity
coconut
gingerale
like
just
awful
flavor
is
sweet
strong
fruity
with
out
a
lot
of
body
or
finesse
just
awful
in
every
way
above
average
for
a
wit
but
a
bit
too
much
sort
of
clouding
what
wits
are
all
about
but
then
again
i
have
to
get
used
to
change
im
sort
of
a
closet
fan
of
this
beer
not
a
great
example
of
a
witbier
the
right
smells
and
tastes
are
subtly
there
but
they
seem
over
processed
and
unrefined
the
one
positive
in
this
brew
is
a
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
despite
the
syrupy
feel
it
is
cool
and
coats
your
mouth
nicely
while
masking
the
9
abv
d
a
strong
tasting
beer
and
bold
i
would
recommend
sampling
with
food
it
seems
a
bit
intense
for
my
taste
10
3
to
really
be
considered
drinkable
i
like
it
but
this
doesnt
hide
the
alcohol
well
not
an
every
day
beer
perhaps
shared
or
as
a
nightcap
best
suits
this
overall
way
to
sweet
and
fruity
a
little
bit
goes
a
long
way
cheers
to
sa
for
their
imperial
series
they
know
the
market
and
they
certainly
know
beer
i
suppose
i
should
not
be
surprised
by
some
of
the
more
negative
reviews
as
for
the
most
part
they
are
from
those
who
see
the
sa
name
and
relegate
it
to
the
lower
echelon
of
craft
brews
this
beer
however
is
exactly
what
it
claims
to
be
when
i
a
imagine
a
imperial
white
i
expect
all
the
great
characteristcs
of
the
true
greats
of
the
style
such
as
hoeggarden
amplified
that
is
what
sa
imperial
white
is
a
fruity
spice
bomb
with
high
alcohol
a
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
a
winning
finish
there
are
many
sa
creations
i
dont
favor
but
this
one
is
a
winner
if
you
are
being
honest
in
your
review
sam
adams
should
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
on
this
one
or
maybe
just
leave
this
style
as
a
crisper
refreshing
type
beer
im
definitely
not
impressed
with
this
one
as
the
drinkability
is
so
low
from
the
alcohol
my
first
taste
of
this
was
at
ebf
09
but
seeing
as
i
had
already
been
to
the
3f
founders
dfh
and
lost
abbey
tables
i
didnt
think
my
initial
reaction
disappointment
was
accurate
luckily
sort
of
i
guess
i
found
a
single
of
it
and
got
a
second
introduction
smells
faintly
of
oranges
and
bananas
nothing
striking
though
not
bad
pours
a
dark
orangishamber
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
basically
resembles
your
average
yuengling
or
such
the
taste
is
citrusy
the
orange
and
coriander
are
certainly
there
but
no
where
near
the
presence
they
have
in
say
dfh
redwhite
its
fruity
but
a
bit
creamy
as
well
much
more
like
a
tripel
than
witbier
again
good
not
great
the
mouth
is
surprisingly
moderate
and
sort
of
thick
its
got
a
sweet
presence
in
he
mouth
and
the
abv
is
certainly
there
its
better
than
your
average
finds
and
its
certainly
got
a
full
flavor
that
isnt
bad
but
its
not
amazing
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
thought
it
would
be
hard
to
brew
an
imperial
wit
that
would
still
be
enjoyable
and
drinkable
but
this
fits
the
bill
and
sammy
has
done
it
well
recommended
drinkability
its
not
bad
whether
or
not
its
a
wit
is
up
for
debate
southhampton
makes
a
double
white
thats
better
id
say
goes
down
well
though
and
its
worth
trying
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
buy
it
again
maybe
if
i
see
it
on
tap
or
something
ill
let
the
rest
age
and
try
one
once
a
year
pretty
good
overall
but
the
thickness
is
what
would
keep
me
from
drinking
more
than
1
or
2
at
a
time
i
drank
this
beer
its
kind
of
orangeamber
in
color
with
a
uniformly
dense
offwhite
beige
head
cloudy
overcast
smells
kinda
citrusy
and
spicy
it
tastes
like
a
saison
sort
of
its
imperial
but
it
aint
white
full
smooth
body
it
finishes
a
little
yeasty
with
mild
jolly
rancher
citrus
fruit
its
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
bother
with
it
again
d
a
wit
on
steroids
probably
not
one
ill
visit
again
my
least
favorite
of
the
new
samuel
adams
imperial
series
by
far
aside
from
that
this
is
a
well
put
together
wheat
beer
the
overall
impression
is
a
mix
of
sam
adams
white
and
leines
sunset
wheat
with
an
imperial
flare
the
abv
is
noticeable
but
not
intrusive
one
i
might
have
againbut
the
is
a
little
bit
highcertainly
worth
a
try
though
samuel
adams
has
created
yet
another
fine
brew
here
this
is
a
heavily
malt
flavored
concoction
that
is
reminiscent
of
a
farmhouse
saison
that
i
brewed
last
year
i
definitely
get
the
banana
that
some
of
the
other
reviewers
have
noted
along
with
some
coriander
and
citrus
pours
nice
and
packs
a
big
punch
definitely
not
a
session
beer
way
to
go
sam
adams
an
imperial
wit
ought
to
be
something
like
celiss
grand
cru
very
perfumy
strong
but
lightbodied
this
bastardization
just
doesnt
work
pours
a
cloudy
orange
small
head
to
it
with
a
small
amount
of
patchy
lacing
smell
is
very
spicy
also
very
boozy
tastewise
nice
body
to
it
the
spiciness
really
comes
through
here
a
very
strong
alcohol
kick
to
it
as
well
this
tastes
stronger
than
a
dfh
120
minute
any
typical
witbier
characteristics
are
just
overmatched
by
the
spiciness
and
mixeddrink
type
alcohol
flavor
kinda
bummed
about
this
one
there
is
no
flavor
detectable
besides
the
ethanol
too
bad
at

abv
this
witbier
is
a
bulky
mess
nothing
refined
rounded
or
drinkable
about
this
offering

concoction
that
should
be
pulled

for

not
bad
this

is
too
sweet
for
me
and
hard
to
really
get
into
this
beer
smacks
you
pretty
hard
in
the
nose
and
the
palate
sam
imperial
white
tried
to
do
too
much
too
fast
i
found
that
it
was
almost
offensively
strong
and
full
of
flavors
that
did
not
blend
well
with
me
therefore
i
found
it
suffered
on
drinkability
yet
despite
this
the
flavors
had
a
pleasant
aftertaste
upon
finishing
the
bottle
i
felt
very
full
however
whether
mentally
or
stomachally
nonetheless
left
me
feeling
a
bit
too
much
this
beer
would
be
alot
better
if
they
toned
down
the
alcohol
and
corriander
it
might
get
better
with
age
same
as
the
double
bock
overall
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
i
will
not
buy
it
again
but
i
still
look
forward
to
their
other
imperial
series
beers
drinkability
not
for
me
too
much
of
an
alcohol
taste
to
be
considered
a
favorite
very
much
a
high
abv
version
of
their
white
ale
if
you
like
the
white
ale
you
should
like
this
mouthfeeldrinkability
foamy
slick
and
just
a
wee
bit
aggressive
it
works
for
this
beer
the
swallow
is
good
never
letting
down
with
regard
to
the
smoother
carbonation
this
beer
makes
its
presence
felt
for
sure
and
it
will
sock
you
if
youre
not
careful
not
a
winner
in

as

needs

this
is
a

or
any

this
is
not
reminds
me
of
a
spiced
hefeweizen
i
like
it
though
and
its
way
better
than
samuel
adams
white
and
one
of
samuel
adams
better
beers
imo
not
reviewing
this
for
the
style
md
full
bodied
light
carbonation
good
drinkability
a
very
tasty
beer
the
only
real
drawback
i
can
find
is
that
the
taste
is
a
little
off
balance
from
a
big
sweetness
to
a
little
bit
too
much
bitterness
in
the
finish
however
i
still
really
like
this
beer
overall
d
ehhh
this
beer
sort
of
reminds
me
of

i
picked
this
up
the
other
day
expecting
the
same
from
sam
adams
which
to
me
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
and
i
wasnt
dissapointed
poured
a
nice
hazy
orange
and
smelled
like
citrus
taste
was
so
imperial
renditions
of
it
often
fall
flat
this
ones
even
hotter
than
most
this
beer
needs
to
sit
in
the
glass
for
1015
minutes
before
drinking
and
in
my
opinion
at
that
time
it
is
an
enjoyable
sipper
i
couldnt
do
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
night
though

but
not
in
a
hoppy
way
very
sweet
and
syrupy
and
warming
as
hell
almost
cloying
contrary
to
whats
above
but
this
could
probably
be
considered
a
tripel
or
something
rather
than
an
imperial
white
ale
too
sweet
and
alcoholic
for
my
tastes

was
a

i
was

among

tried
it

my

first
tasting
of
it
was
of
dissatisfaction
i
greatly
liked
the
beer
and
i
will
be
picking
up
a
four
pack
and
will
update
my
review
when
i
have
more
of
this
good
beer
duhast500jan

gave
this
beer
a
higher
rating
because
it
was
one
of
the
first
craft
beers
i
ever
had
and
really
enjoyed
too
heavy
on
the
blackberry
almost
like
they
added
syrup
to
the
beer
great
in
warm
weather
especially
at
night
hazy
golden
color
aroma
of
wheat
and
blackberry
flavor
is
disappointing
not
a
true
wit
no
taste
of
spice
very
little
citrus
just
a
lot
blackberries
would
not
buy
again
o
i
went
into
this
review
having
drank
this
many
times
in
the
past
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
summer
thirst
quenching
shelf
beers
i
usually
dont
give
it
the
chance
to
warm
up
but
for
the
sake
of
the
review
i
let
it
warm
up
from
my
fridge
a
little
the
sub
par
taste
really
shines
through
when
warm
still
i
think
this
is
outstanding
as
a
refreshing
summer
brew
enjoyed
cold
but
compared
to
some
of
the
great
witbiers
brewed
locally
to
me
i
do
not
think
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
blackberry
or
not
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
bottle
has
a
best
before
date
of
july
2014
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
cant
get
it
around
my
area
though
o
sam
adams
rarely
gets
the
credit
they
deserve
and
i
think
the
same
can
be
said
for
fruit
infused
wheat
ales
definitely
recommended
for
fans
of
such
beers
overall
i
dont
think
ill
drink
this
one
again
unexpectedly
good
not
recommended
for
lovers
of
the
classic
wit
style
you
will
not
find
any
classic
witness
here
overall
the
most
enjoyable
thing
about
this
brew
was
its
drinkability
again
in
line
with
our
first
thoughts
on
the
first
sip
this
was
a
surprisingly
refreshing
brew
we
tend
to
preconceive
our
thoughts
about
the
macro
craft
producers
but
for
what
it
is
they
did
a
nice
job
here
while
this
isnt
going
to
win
any
awards
in
our
book
they
kept
it
seasonal
fresh
and
light
enough
to
keep
it
flowing
thats
where
this
beer
functions
well
the
flavored
and
aromatic
inclusions
were
decent
represented
in
the
final
product
and
blended
nicely
enough
but
youre
going
to
be
drinking
this
one
more
for
the
experience
and
company
of
close
friends
than
you
are
for
anything
groundbreaking
on
the
palate
or
brain
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
i
enjoyed
the
blackberry
sweetness
of
the
beer
poured
out
of
a
bottle
into
a
glass
this
beer
is
a
gold
color
that
looks
like
honey
it
smells
sweet
extremely
fruity
with
a
hint
of
wheat
sam
adams
has
a
habit
of
getting
things
right
when
it
comes
to
microbrewed
beer
the
taste
is
extremely
accurate
sweet
blackberries
and
fruit
with
the
right
amount
of
wheaty
beer
taste
nice
white
puffy
head
with
good
staying
power
the
usual
cloudy
witbier
look
so
nothing
too
out
of
the
ordinary
i
was
impressed
with
the
strong
blackberry
smell
slight
tinge
of
hops
to
go
along
with
it
too
the
aftertaste
in
these
types
of
beer
could
be
awful
but
this
one
was
wasnt
too
bad
at
all
what
surprised
me
was
the
syrupy
feel
in
my
mouth
silky
even
overall
not
one
of
the
best
sam
adams
but
decent
for
a
summertime
offering
overall
im
a
little
disappointed
in
the
amount
of
berry
flavor
delivered
in
the
taste
versus
the
sweet
juicy
scent
this
beer
has
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
other
fruit
beers
that
are
done
better
opaque
yellow
appearance
with
mild
head
and
little
carbonation
very
fruity
aroma
th
blackberry
definitely
comes
out
here
smells
like
hot
jello
right
before
you
put
it
in
the
fridge
yeasty
flavor
that
kind
of
clashes
with
the
fruitiness
of
the
beer
no
outstanding
depth
unfortunately
we
didnt
like
it
too
much
due
to
our
opinion
that
the
blackberry
fruitiness
clashes
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
3
25
d
im
tasty
but
its
not
much
of
a
beer
o
its
no
allagash
white
thats
for
sure
but
this
is
a
gradea
panty
dropper
that
has
some
mass
appeal
i
wouldnt
be
averse
to
buying
this
again
for
company
and
i
would
easily
choose
this
over
say
blue
moon
an
interesting
beer
to
say
the
least
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
but
not
completely
discouraged
after
tasting
this
it
has
the
wheat
flavours
coupled
with
the
blackberry
through
out
its
worth
a
shot
even
if
to
see
what
it
tastes
like
personally
i
felt
underwhelmed
but
i
can
see
the
appeal
overall
an
alright
berry
flavored
brew
not
overly
sweet
yet
maintaining
a
decent
berry
flavoring
very
refreshing
all
season
fruit
beer
it
pours
just
a
tiny
bit
dusty
mostly
blonde
with
maybe
the
faintest
purple
hue
and
an
average
white
head
on
top
thats
gone
in
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
a
little
strange
with
the
fruit
sweetness
not
really
coming
through
at
all
and
the
yeast
and
wheat
malt
being
more
dominant
not
until
the
flavor
can
you
tell
its
a
fruit
beer
the
blackberry
is
strong
and
forward
without
being
too
sweet
at
all
its
summery
and
fresh
while
being
wintery
and
preserved
at
the
same
time
i
like
this
beer
because
its
one
of
the
few
in
the
genre
that
i
think
retains
its
drinkability
for
all
12
months
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
with
the
yeast
imparting
just
a
hint
of
citrusy
acidity
and
pep
nice
feel
light
in
body
with
strong
carbonation
its
refreshing
and
satisfying
and
i
much
prefer
this
to
most
other
fruity
infused
wheat
beers
out
there
pours
a
hazy
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
berries
and
a
slight
vomit
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
tartness
and
thankfully
no
vomit
flavor
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
for
again
the
aromas
are
mostly
fruity
and
berrylike
with
a
light
malty
backbone
and
a
hint
of
spice
flavors
are
similar
fruity
spicy
berry
flavors
dominate
while
the
malt
adds
some
light
bread
background
but
the
more
generic
berry
aroma
seems
more
specifically
blackberry
upon
tasting
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
but
about
as
expected
on
this
count
somewhat
unappealing
aftertaste
o
i
love
the
idea
but
the
wit
was
not
broadcast
as
well
as
it
should
have
been
aggressive
blackberry
and
under
achieved
wit
flavors
not
a
huge
fan
as
a
witbierbut
its
really
easy
drinking
i
think
my
wife
would
love
this
something
i
wouldnt
buy
again
for
myself
but
maybe
for
the
lovely
lady
at
home
should
have
just
marketed
as
a
fruit
beer
this
ends
up
being
a
decent
inoffensive
fruit
beer
that
is
pleasantly
refreshing
although
labeled
as
a
witbier
i
didnt
detect
any
notes
that
would
lead
me
to
belive
that
this
was
brewed
with
wheat
as
a
fruit
beer
it
does
the
job
overall
this
beer
was
a
miss
it
just
didnt
quite
work
i
think
it
would
have
worked
better
if
it
were
a
little
bit
sweeter
some
of
the
other
viewers
say
this
beer
is
too
sweet
which
i
just
dont
get
maybe
i
got
a
weird
bottle
i
like
how
it
finishes
tho
nice
and
clean
with
the
blackberry
flavors
lingering
o
although
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
might
appeal
to
some
type
of
people
such
as
those
that
like
sweet
fruity
lambics
i
thought
that
the
blackberry
taste
seemed
a
little
too
pronounced
and
artificial
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
piss
yellow
with
an
ever
so
slight
hint
of
blue
that
makes
the
beer
seem
like
a
grayed
yellow
almost
like
a
corn
syrup
the
head
poured
thin
and
cream
white
but
dissipates
very
quickly
leaving
a
thin
wall
of
lacing
the
smell
is
a
nice
bouquet
of
light
blackberry
and
light
wheat
with
an
interesting
spice
lying
below
the
wheatstink
is
definitely
the
dominant
smell
though
the
beer
tastes
thick
with
a
lovely
mix
of
the
wheat
maltysweet
and
the
more
soursweet
of
the
blackberries
slight
citrus
seems
to
be
hiding
in
the
back
of
the
flavor
and
nicely
rounds
the
beer
giving
it
a
ghost
of
a
bitter
hint
the
aftertaste
is
a
lovely
light
lingering
of
the
berries
in
your
mouth
mouthfeel
is
a
little
strange
with
very
fierce
carbonation
that
leaves
a
burn
on
the
tongue
but
other
than
that
the
mouth
is
very
clean
and
slightly
dry
with
a
wetter
feel
on
its
roof
the
beer
is
slightly
creamy
in
feel
with
a
good
lighter
beer
feel
hidden
underneath
the
harsh
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
decent
more
mass
produced
beer
it
is
actually
one
of
my
favorite
berrybased
beers
i
think
as
they
got
the
berry
taste
wonderfully
mixed
with
the
witbier
style
and
i
dont
really
care
if
they
used
real
berries
or
berry
syrup
this
beer
is
worthy
of
a
try
in
saying
that
it
was
a
good
flavor
and
went
down
smooth
cant
justify
9
dollars
for
a
6
pack
of
this
but
id
try
it
again
better
taste
than
expected
nice
wheat
with
fruity
taste
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
same
old
hop
style
as
all
the
other
sam
adams
brews
and
is
slightly
surprising
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
but
it
was
to
be
expected
from
this
brand
i
havent
met
a
supremely
astonishing
taste
character
yet
from
this
brewer
overall
not
bad
but
pretty
average
all
around
im
not
sure
if
i
would
seek
it
out
again
but
it
is
refreshing
and
a
decent
brew
from
sam
adams
while
samuel
adams
blackberry
witbier
smells
great
and
has
a
really
nice
mouth
feel
its
really
just
an
average
beer
especially
after
a
few
sips
when
the
blackberry
seems
to
disappear
personally
i
could
never
drink
more
than
one
bottle
in
a
session
good
but
not
spectacular
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
little
bit
of
wheat
but
what
is
really
standing
out
is
a
very
sweet
blackberry
component
the
flavor
is
also
full
of
extremely
sweet
and
somewhat
cloying
blackberry
fruit
notes
there
is
some
wheat
and
maybe
a
hint
of
coriander
but
the
fruit
is
front
and
center
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
twofinger
length
white
head
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
streaming
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
sweet
blackberries
dominate
the
smell
i
can
also
pick
up
some
of
the
faint
malt
aroma
as
well
blackberry
hits
the
mouth
at
the
beginning
with
the
clean
wheat
malt
taste
coming
through
at
the
back
there
is
little
hop
flavor
there
is
some
coriander
as
well
the
flavors
complement
each
other
well
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
it
is
smooth
and
refreshing
the
drinkability
is
high
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
if
youre
looking
to
experiment
with
fruit
beer
picking
this
up
as
a
single
isnt
a
bad
idea

with

thin
offwhite

smells
of
a
hint
of
blackberries
taste
begins
with
a
hint
of
ghost
blackberry
sweetness
then
following
is
an
interesting
pecan
flavor
and
then
some
bready
toasty
flavor
a
hint
of
tart
blackberry
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
sort
of
light
overall
a
decent
beer
though
a
bit
more
fruit
flavoring
than
i
typically
like
in
a
beer
i
really
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
12oz
serving
in
a
session
overall
an
interesting
take
on
a
witbier
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
aggressiveness
with
the
flavors
but
thats
not
necessarily
true
to
the
style
regardless
i
love
the
wheat
and
blackberry
pairing
o
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
ive
had
it
before
but
wanted
to
put
out
a
fair
review
while
ive
had
it
recently
id
have
this
again
preferably
on
tap
few
americanmade
witbiers
impress
me
this
is
no
different
not
sure
if
blackberry
is
a
fruit
id
add
to
one
but
it
has
a
pleasant
aftertaste
and
grows
on
you
as
it
warms
3
5
pours
to
a
creamy
white
head
and
generous
lace
color
is
deep
gold
with
very
little
haze
i
did
not
roll
the
bottle
aroma
is
a
combination
of
creamy
malt
and
berries
flavor
is
fruity
and
sweet
mix
of
wheat
coriander
and
blackberries
mouthfeel
is
light
and
co2
is
strong
overall
i
think
this
is
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
that
appeals
to
those
who
like
fruity
drinks
my
first
ever
wit
this
one
poured
deep
golden
with
a
very
small
head
aroma
of
spice
and
sweet
sweet
sweetness
with
only
a
hint
of
the
berries
flavor
follows
very
much
on
the
sweet
side
wheat
honey
berries
some
very
faint
yeasty
characteristic
dirty
finish
mouthfeel
was
a
little
heavy
with
some
artificial
taste
to
this
lots
of
berries
on
the
flavor
like
syrup
enough
carbonation
to
lighten
things
up
and
make
them
relatively
drinkable
ok
pretty
good
flavored
brew
not
really
much
on
the
fruity
blends
but
this
was
nice
the
appearance
bout
what
you
would
expect
from
a
wheat
brew
anyway
the
taste
is
very
basic
with
lots
of
fruity
flavors
perfect
to
introduce
to
a
lady
friend
maybe
mouthfeel
is
light
and
overall
i
would
pick
it
again
in
a
pick
six
o
this
is
a
solid
fruit
beer
i
like
the
blackberry
flavor
refreshing
and
tasty
o
this
is
not
the
worst
berry
beer
ive
had
but
its
certainly
not
the
best
either
if
you
really
like
blackberries
i
suggest
having
a
blackberry
flavored
vodka
stop
putting
your
berries
in
my
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
that
is
a
break
from
the
norm
a
middle
of
the
road
brew
from
a
quality
brewery
o
this
is
about
what
i
expected
it
to
be
an
average
witbier
overpowered
by
blackberries
overall
drinkability
im
not
sure
theres
really
a
good
way
to
make
this
beer
having
the
flavor
any
thinner
would
make
it
seem
weak
and
watery
but
having
it
as
strong
as
it
is
sort
of
drowns
out
the
wheat
and
makes
the
concoction
feel
over
flavored
theres
no
good
way
to
balance
it
if
you
dont
like
o
good
session
beer
not
too
heavy
on
the
fruit
so
it
goes
down
really
easy
still
just
a
fruit
beer
although
at
least
it
doesnt
taste
like
extract
overall
a
very
average
beer
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
flavor
but
it
still
is
a
decent
beer
a
good
drinker
for
the
spring
sam
adams
cranks
out
more
styles
and
more
beers
than
just
about
anyone
so
i
suppose
we
can
give
them
slack
for
making
a
few
bad
ones
but
this
one
just
is
down
right
terrible
overall
pretty
middle
of
the
road
not
a
fruit
beer
fan
this
is
tame
just
ok
i
am
going
with
one
of
my
s
adams
perfect
pint
glasses
since
that
seems
like
a
perfect
idea
to
me
the
two
foamy
fizzy
fingers
of
eggnogcolored
head
evidenced
decent
retention
color
was
a
deepyellow
with
a
lot
of
suspended
floaties
which
i
imagined
was
the
spices
nose
was
rich
in
blackberry
no
doubt
but
it
was
also
kind
of
sweet
for
my
liking
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
the
taste
was
less
sweet
than
what
i
had
anticipated
instead
the
tartness
of
the
wheat
gave
a
nice
counterbalance
to
the
fruity
sweetness
finish
was
semisweet
and
while
it
was
refreshing
one
would
be
plenty
for
me
it
might
be
nicer
in
the
summer
heat
but
i
just
was
not
feeling
it
on
this
chill
rainy
evening
o
i
recall
trying
this
beer
very
shortly
after
it
was
released
and
being
blown
away
by
it
my
intial
impressions
have
changed
in
the
past
year
or
so
this
beer
seems
to
have
become
grittier
and
the
blackberry
flavor
now
seems
a
bit
artificial
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
reach
for
it
on
a
regular
basis
comments
samuel
adams
blackberry
witbier
may
miss
the
mark
for
a
witbier
but
it
is
a
tasty
very
enjoyable
beer
o
the
blackberry
taste
is
too
artificial
for
my
tastes
even
if
they
did
use
real
blackberries
definitely
a
beer
for
beginners
or
women
who
enjoy
sweet
fruity
beers
good
worth
having
overy
drinkable
but
not
a
lot
of
complexity
in
this
one
not
interested
in
getting
this
again
overall
very
respectable
not
a
huge
fan
of
fruit
flavor
beers
but
no
qualms
with
this
one
maybe
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
thats
quibbling
o
pleasant
and
good
with
a
savory
meal
but
not
good
enough
to
drink
on
its
own
just
for
the
pleasure
of
it
the
sammy
a
blackberry
wit
is
very
nice
and
i
am
not
normally
a
fruity
beer
type
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
1
finger
white
foam
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
foam
film
then
ring
a
medium
amount
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
lacing
left
behind
smells
of
blackberry
and
wheat
with
the
blackberry
very
dominate
has
a
sweet
smell
tastes
of
blackberry
that
is
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
the
smell
would
indicate
a
nice
wheat
taste
on
the
backend
really
help
balance
out
the
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
with
a
slighly
creamy
mouthfeel
probably
one
of
my
favorite
fruit
beers
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
think
this
is
an
interesting
twist
at
a
witbier
i
really
enjoyed
it
because
i
had
to
step
out
of
my
box
of
for
this
beer
blueberry
is
not
often
found
this
style
yet
the
boston
brewing
company
has
made
this
work
d
solid
example
for
the
style
complex
and
drinkable
id
come
back
to
this
one
am
intrigued
by
fruit
beers
and
love
blackberry
so
i
had
to
try
it
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
inhaled
the
blackberry
aroma
as
stated
by
others
not
a
lot
of
head
lacing
minimal
and
dissapears
rather
quickly
but
the
taste
was
awesome
i
agree
it
had
a
rather
thin
mouthfeel
but
it
was
refreshing
and
went
great
with
some
mexican
food
i
was
having
i
found
this
at
world
market
and
i
could
see
this
as
only
being
available
in
niche
markets
i
will
buy
this
again
if
i
can
find
it
o
if
you
like
very
fruity
beers
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
beer
it
is
light
and
refreshing
however
the
fruit
is
very
powerful
this
is
a
great
option
for
those
who
like
beers
that
dont
taste
like
beers
with
a
very
sparse
but
not
terrible
stick
to
straight
ales
and
lagers
along
with
a
coffee
stout
though
i
probably
wouldnt
be
buying
it
outside
of
the
summer
variety
pack
beerphan86jul
22
and
a
light
hopped
ending
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
for
a
summertime
bonfire
but
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly

go
ahead
and
try
this
one
nothing
harsh
as
it
is
a
bit
simplistic
and
doesnt
resemble
a
classic
witbier
in
the
slightest
just
a
a
fruit

that
youre

out

i
had
heard
mixed
reviews
about
this
beer

the

is
theyre
really
only
good
at
making
boston

in
my
opinion

i
could
drink
a
few

dont

very
much
the

is
composed
of

as
well
with
some
hints
of
spicy
hops
and
lots
of
fruit

not
a

boston
brewing
did
a
good
job
at
maintaining
a
balance
with
this
d
a
full
bodied
decent
beer
with
an
above
average
taste
like
i
said
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
very
dry
fruity
kind
of
wine
or
even
a
wine
cooler
good
for
a
beer
or
two
but
after
that
it
goes
down
hill
not
what
i
expected
from
sam
adams
i
could
drink
about
half
of
this
not
my
bag
poured
into
the
pint
glass
only
managed
half
of
pint
of
beer
the
other
half
was
foam
took
about
a
minute
to
die
down
light
golden
pour
nose
of
fruity
berries
taste
is
sour
and
the
blackberry
leaves
a
strong
aftertaste
this
is
not
something
i
can
enjoy
enough
to
drink
the
entire
bottle
im
hoping
itll
get
better
now
after
just
3
sips
it
tastes
like
seltzer
ouch
pours
an
appealing
clear
golden
amber
with
a
decent
head
offwhite
fairly
fluffy
and
fairly
persistent
aroma
is
malty
with
a
firm
blackberry
component
that
gets
your
attention
but
does
not
overwhelm
the
beery
aroma
flavor
is
like
a
good
ale
and
again
the
blackberry
tone
is
firm
but
not
too
strong
texture
is
smooth
refreshing
fizzy
lively
the
taste
of
blackberries
is
way
too
strong
would
be
better
if
it
were
more
of
a
witbier
taste
and
more
subtle
blueberries
i
could
possibly
have
two
or
three
in
a
sitting
i
would
drink
again
but
not
anytime
soon
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
good
example
of
a
wit
but
as
far
as
fruity
beers
go
they
did
a
nice
job
restraining
themselves
it
turns
out
to
be
a
beer
first
with
blackberry
added
rather
than
vice
versa
like
many
other
fruit
beers
for
what
it
is
this
isnt
bad
at
all
fairly
simple
and
easily
drinkable
it
wasnt
amazing
but
the
light
blackberry
taste
blends
well
with
things
this
is
a
solid
effort
the
6pack
will
not
go
to
waste
drinkability
this
is
a
refreshing
late
summer
brew
but
it
will
doubtless
not
appeal
to
many
i
cant
help
but
feel
despite
the
labels
talk
of
marion
blackberries
that
the
flavor
is
little
more
than
the
same
sort
of
flavoring
one
can
buy
at
any
brewing
stone
still
not
a
bad
brew
notes
another
in
the
brewmasters
collection
from
sam
adams
this
one
is
solid
drinkability
is
decent
when
it
comes
to
fruit
beers
there
are
generally
two
categories
the
beers
that
overdo
the
fruit
and
end
up
tasting
like
fruit
juice
and
those
that
underutilize
the
best
qualities
of
the
fruit
and
end
up
leaving
a
lot
to
be
desired
a
small
number
of
fruit
beers
walk
between
the
lines
and
use
the
fruit
in
a
way
that
accentuates
everything
good
about
the
flavors
and
offsets
the
downfalls
with
malts
and
hops
see
the
cantillons
sweetwater
blue
flanders
reds
etc
this
one
definitely
underutilizes
the
fruit
backing
away
from
showcasing
the
blackberries
and
ends
up
as
a
mildly
bland
and
underwhelming
fruit
beer
sam
adams
usually
does
much
better
than
this
dissapointing
f
clean
finish
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
while
i
am
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
i
have
to
admit
this
is
not
at
all
bad
the
fruit
flavor
is
subtle
enough
that
it
doesnt
overwhelm
the
true
beer
character
while
this
may
be
a
refreshing
tasty
summer
beer
for
some
i
did
not
care
much
for
this
the
blackberry
presence
was
much
too
strong
for
my
liking
and
seemed
artificial
my
fiancee
who
enjoys
cherry
wheat
hasnt
touched
this
beer
since
her
first
bottle
for
the
same
reasons
if
the
flavors
were
more
subtle
it
might
seem
more
like
a
wit
instead
of
a
berliner
weisse
definitely
something
i
would
share
with
first
time
beer
drinkers
that
love
that
berry
flavor
plus
also
a
beer
that
would
be
appropriate
for
summer
to
autumn
one
key
note
though
gotta
serve
it
extra
cold
because
if
you
dont
it
taste
like
cough
syrup
with
a
bitter
after
taste
i
guess
this
beer
might
go
good
with
desert
or
cheese
or
something
overall
this
is
an
eh
beer

light

by

for

these
can

prejudge
this

flavor
that

dry
with
a

taste
its
tastes
like

very
fake
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a

with

this

which
is
a
plus
a
touch
too
watery
and
sweet
for
my
tastes
similar
to
the

but
not
bad
at
all
the
blackberry
taste
however
was
a

but
i
couldnt
tell
that
from
the
aroma
the
taste
was
a
little
more
straightforward
in
that
i
could
tell
it
was
blackberry
or
one
indicative
of
the
style
certainly
not
a
great
flavored
wit
but
this
just
didnt
hit
the
spot
for
me
the
pour
was
a
cloudy
light
gold
color
with
a
nice
tall
head
in
my
pint
glass
i
noticed
an
almost
artificial
blackberry
smell
the
blackberry
was
also
pretty
stout
in
the
taste
department
it
felt
nice
and
light
in

very
few
that
pull

this
is
the

im

it
has
its
target
audience
especially
good
for
someone
who
is
not
a
hop
fan
but
doesnt
want
a
big
malty
beer
not
sure
i
would
purchase
again
and
added
a
hint
of
blackberry
imo
instead
of
going
all

really

any
of

the

it
taste

all
of

in

i
usually
like

a

classic
and
well
deserving

from

thank
god
they
brought
this
back
in
the
cold
snap
theyve
introduced
with
a
little
extra
spices
always
loved
this
one
was
devastated
when
it
taken
away
from
being
the
main
spring
seasonal
feel
good
on
the
tongue
not
too
dry
very
refreshing
yet
tasty
at
the

time
still

not
much

on
this
what
is
there
is
hay
and
maybe
a
bit
of
light
fruits
flavor
comes
in
as
a
bit
watered
down
some
yeast
a
few
hitns
of
pear
or
apple
easy
drinker
with
barely
any
real
belgian
yeast
or
spice
that
i
would
be
looking
for
with
the
style
nice
to
have
the
option
from
sa
but
pretty
mediocre
o
good
for
a
witbier
uh
only
decent
to
me
unsure
if
id
come
back
to
i
think
this
beer
is
okay
to
drink
and
would
be
really
refreshing
in
the
summer
with
its
soft
citrus
profile
and
slight
musty
hop
profile
o
out
of
any
sam
adams
brews
ive
tried
to
date
this
one
disappoints
a
bit
its
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
its
an
underwhelming
brew
for
what
i
was
expecting
and
i
know
it
can
be
brewed
with
more
umph
still
it
is
an
easy
drinking
wheat
ale
that
i
wouldnt
have
any
issues
with
enjoying
at
any
time
and
think
its
well
suited
to
anyone
getting
into
the
style
bottle
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
pretty
nice
head
that
fades
into
lacing
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
very
carbonated
beer
smells
of
fruits
spice
malts
and
yeast
tastes
much
the
same
overall
a
little
bready
and
thin
with
an
overpowering
citrusorange
peel
and
spice
flavor
that
seems
to
be
a
little
overbearing
nothing
special
here
ill
stick
to
the
belgian
brews
oits
nice
a
good
blue
moon
alternative
if
youre
trying
to
slowly
pull
people
away
from
macro
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
richness
to
the
additional
flavors
but
i
was
satisfied
with
it
as
a
beer
poured
a
hazy
golden
brown
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
nice
frothy
white
head
some
sediment
visible
in
the
glass
crisp

in
the
aroma
crisp
taste
wheat
citrus
zest
coriander
and
some
peppery
spice
a
little
bit
stale
and

an
okay

bottle
pours
a

color
with
a

that
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
sublte
citrus
fruit
and
spice
aromas
coriander
flavor
is
pretty
much
the
same
orange
and
citusy
fruity
flavors
with
a
slight
belgian
spice
and
wheat
flavors
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
smooth
and
refreshing
again
minimally
tart
and
refreshing
good
mouthfeel
smooth
finish
with
good
carbonation
a
good
beer
feel
is
very
unlike
sa
beer
its
very
distracting
and
ultimately
almost
ruins
the
beer
otherwise
its
a
fairly
good
tasting
beer
but
lacks
in
aroma
and
feel
a
decent
beer
i
enjoyed
it
its
sunday
night
after
a
tough
loss
on
the
ice
lower
right
back
is
tender
from
a
spill
needed
some
bottle
of
healing
so
i
am
trying
hte
white
ale
working
off
a
mixed
12pck
the
white
ale
is
a
yellow
unfiltered
beer
with
decent
carbonation
and
white
head
that
seems
to
be
lacing
nicely
the
nose
is
very
subtle
but
i
sensed
orange
peel
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
typical
of
most
witbiers
there
is
a
tingling
of
the
buds
from
the
spices
they
brewed
the
beer
with
then
is
ome
off
the
pallete
nice
a
crisp
a
decent
beer
for
after
hockey
mouthfeel
is
fine
not
sure
i
would
session
this
beer
because
i
am
not
that
big
of
fan
of
witbiers
sammy
a
did
another
fine
job
with
this
one
not
a
lot
in
the
way
of
belgian
aromas
almost
pilsnerish
actually
lightly
sweet
gentle
noble
hops
very
gentle
belgian
yeast
character
tastes
ok
if
uninspired
kinda
of
a
hybrid
between
stella
and
a
mildly
hopped
pils
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
this
style
can
bring
a
lot
more
to
the
table
pours
with
a
quickly
dissipating
head
that
leaves
only
a
thin
layer
of
foam
in
its
wake
beer
is
a
pale
golden
with
aslight
amount
of
haziness
aroma
is
a
bit
offputting
with
an
odd
chemically
presence
slightly
reminiscent
of
disinfectant
that
i
have
notices
in
other
sa
products
taste
reflects
this
odd
presence
as
well
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
but
has
a
decent
level
of
carbonation
overall
i
was
very
disappointed
in
this
effort
and
had
a
similar
reaction
as
i
did
when
i
sampled
sas
coastal
wheat
drinking
this
as
i
review
it
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
snifter
not
much
head
to
speak
of
and
what
little
head
there
was
dissapeared
quickly
the
nose
very
malty
with
a
hint
of
smoke
in
it
mouthfeel
is
very
good
its
very
creamy
this
beer
is
moderately
bitter
but
mainly
sweet
the
beers
appearance
is
very
cloudy
and
golden
yellow
im
tempted
to
call
it
a
mix
between
amber
and
yellow
could
be
more
carbonation
overall
its
an
ok
beer
not
sams
best
though
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
definitely
something
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
nothing
to
really
make
you
sit
up
and
proclaim
this
an
amazing
beer
very
good
brew
again
from
the
bbc
o
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
isnt
really
that
refreshing
or
thirst
quenching
o
nice
flavors
but
the
mouthfeel
could
use
a
little
work
a
decent
beer
for
when
you
want
a
little
flavor
but
arent
looking
for
a
flavor
bomb
im
a
little
perplexed
as
to
why
bbc
are
making
this
a
fallwinter
seasonal
as
it
seems
more
like
something
suited
for
spring
o
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
its
an
easy
drink
and
wheat
beers
dont
tend
to
overpower
the
alcohol
is
barely
present
and
the
spice
blend
is
solid
d
simple
and
straightforward
easy
drinking
and
rather
sessionable
not
an
overly
remarkable
witbier
but
yet
another
solid
member
of
the
samuel
adams
lineup
i
would
have
no
trouble
throwing
back
a
couple
of
these
though
it
would
be
my
first
choice
for
a
wheat
based
brew
this
white
ale
pours
out
as
a
cloudy
opaque
yellowish
gold
color
there
a
small
amount
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
after
the
pour
the
aromas
are
slightly
floral
and
grainy
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
a
little
bit
of
citrus
upfront
that
fades
into
the
wheat
back
bone
there
is
a
little
bit
of
some
wild
flower
type
of
thing
in
there
too
but
very
mellow
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightly
carbonated
this
is
a
decent
but
very
drinkable
white
ale
do
pretty
easy
drinker
here
read
somewhat
bland
label
says
its
brewed
with
unusual
spices
didnt
get
out
of
it
coriander
perhaps
crisp
clean
would
be
a
great
6
pack
night
in
the
summer
with
some
friends
when
the
focus
wasnt
on
the
beer
does
this
happen
anymore
d
easy
drinking
but
light
on
flavour
o
not
bad
not
great
just
in
between
i
could
have
used
tons
more
funkiness
overall
this
one
was
a
safe
attempt
taste
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
end
and
the
orange
really
stands
out
here
again
very
herbal
with
a
tarragon
aftertaste
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
makes
this
refreshing
but
doesnt
take
over
the
beer
good
springtime
beer
overall
a
good
offering
one
of
my
favorites
from
sa
drinkability
i
must
really
be
in
the
mood
for
this
one
best
thing
ive
had
from
sam
adams
hands
down
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
traditional
witbier
to
me
but
its
real
nice
whatever
it
is
overall
a
decent
witbier
and
a
good
offering
from
sam
adams
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
makes
a
good
session
beer
feels
very
appropriate
to
spring
time
just
as
the
weather
is
finally
getting
warm
d
an
average
witbier
at
best
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
about
it
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
not
sure
id
want
to
not
one
of
sas
better
beers
overall
a
decent
interpretation
of
a
witbier
overall
this
is
a
barely
less
than
average
wit
i
guess
id
compare
it
to
blue
moon
or
something
to
that
affect
nothing
special
one
of
the
better
american
takes
on
the
belgian
witbier
tasty
and
an
easy
drinker
and
better
than
a
blue
moon
id
probably
have
this
again
if
it
was
on
sale
but
i
dont
know
if
id
actively
seek
it
out
finish
light
grassiness
and
thats
about
it
p
s
my
beer
is
gone
and
my
glass
still
has
pretty
lacing
all
over
it
d
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
refreshing
its
a
decent
beer
and
i
might
purchase
this
again
i
do
not
taste
the
exstravigant
flavors
that
some
reviewers
aledge
to
pours
a
very
lite
goldenyellow
a
white
head
sticks
around
a
bit
bunches
of
carb
trailers
looks
good
for
a
wit
smell
is
slightly
skunky
opening
up
to
a
mild
potpourri
of
spices
taste
starts
of
on
the
bitter
end
and
opens
up
into
more
citrusy
territory
before
finishing
dry
and
bitter
again
kind
of
overwhelmed
by
the
variety
of
spices
but
nice
complexity
tasty
wit
id
drink
it
again
md
very
drinkable
i
would
even
say
refreshing
and
its
930
at
night
i
think
this
is
a
nice
offering
for
what
it
is
a
lighter
spring
beer
that
still
has
some
flavor
im
not
hating
on
this
bad
boy
overall
like
most
sam
adams
brews
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
faithful
interpretation
of
the
style
but
is
not
necessarily
the
best
example
definitely
an
enjoyable
and
easily
drinkable
brew
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
again
overall
not
the
best
wit
ive
ever
had
inoffensive
enough
but
just
too
thin
and
lifeless
piss
poor
for
the
style
really
nothing
enjoyable
about
it
the
combination
of
uncharacteristic
sweetness
and
excessive
spicing
make
this
pretty
hard
to
choke
down
its
a
good
beer
and
decent
representation
of
the
style
overall
grade
cc
d
tasty
i
like
it
a
pretty
good
wheat
beer
easy
to
drink
mf
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
with
flavors
that
linger
overall
it
is
kind
of
a
let
down
i
understand
it
is
an
american
version
of
a
belgian
style
i
just
dont
think
it
is
well
represented
of
the
witbier
its
classified
aswell
dwhy
is
this
beer
in
both
the
winter
and
american
originals
packs
it
is
a
very
boring
bland
beer
a
nice
beer
and
great
in
the
sampler
packs
that
sam
adams
graces
us
with
although
also
worthy
to
but
it
on
its
own
sam
adams
did
a
pretty
good
job
trying
to
copy
the
belgian
white
ale
style
d
quite
a
drinkable
beer
either
on
its
own
or
as
a
session
poured
out
of
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
was
a
very
light
golden
color
and
it
was
very
cloudy
a
think
white
creamy
head
appeared
about
2
finger
widths
of
head
good
lacing
a
nice
aroma
that
had
a
smell
of
wheatlemon
and
coriander
the
body
and
mouthfeel
is
light
this
is
a
average
example
of
a
witbier
i
hate
to
say
this
but
i
would
have
to
give
blue
moon
the
nod
over
this
one
sam
adams
white
ale
is
a
good
beer
it
is
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
ok
lacing
its
has
an
aroma
of
citrus
and
spices
and
taste
is
maltly
sweet
with
a
little
bite
at
the
end
p
pretty
good
body
to
this
beer
to
make
for
a
little
above
average
feel
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
but
its
definitely
not
my
favorite
or
the
best
from
sam
adams
but
it
worth
a
go
while
this
beer
is
no
allagash
white
it
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
wits
that
has
ever
graced
my
palate
honestly
i
just
assumed
this
would
be
a
throw
away
beer
in
the
mixed
twelve
as
it
seemed
out
of
place
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
it
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
while
it
is
an
odd
choice
for
a
selection
that
bridges
the
gap
between
winter
and
spring
it
is
pretty
darn
tasty
12
oz
into
a
snifter
samuel
adams
produces
a
fine
lager
and
a
fine
pilsener
but
once
they
get
into
ales
it
seems
like
it
is
all
fails
this
white
ale
is
no
exception
the
spicing
is
flat
the
malt
is
kind
of
boring
and
theres
not
too
much
to
it
except
a
decent
look
the
yeast
is
wrong
too
was
hard
to
finish
the
glass
and
i
considered
pouring
it
out
but
dont
like
to
waste
beer
so
finished
it
came
as
part
of
a
sampler
pack
avoid
this
one
there
are
so
many
better
white
ales
out
there
drinkability
very
light
and
would
be
easy
to
drink
throughout
the
night
very
drinkable
spring
time
beer
at
5abv
could
a
have
a
few
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
standard
pint
enjoy
before
may
notched
on
the
label
pours
a
pale
honeyorange
with
a
slightly
hazy
clarity
and
a
loose
half
inch
offwhite
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
mostly
consistent
skim
not
much
happening
in
the
nose
faint
citrus
rind
and
a
trace
of
coriander
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
theres
a
slightly
bready
character
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
lively
carbonation
a
kiss
of
citrus
astringency
and
a
semidry
finish
a
decent
witbier
albeit
somewhat
lackluster
cant
touch
the
belgians
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
on
a
warm
day
taste
starts
out
with
a
slight
fruity
taste
that
is
followed
by
a
bread
and
spice
flavor
the
flavor
fades
fairly
quick
d
very
drinkable
relatively
low
abv
very
flavorful
but
not
overly
rich
d
its
a
white
ale
with
no
off
flavors
not
especially
interesting
but
still
quite
drinkable
d
i
doubt
ill
have
this
again
anytime
soon
d
very
drinkable
nice
change
from
the
typical
sam
adams
beer
no
doubt
about
it
sams
white
ale
isnt
a
top
example
of
the
style
hoegaarden
remains
the
kind
but
its
a
solid
example
that
manages
to
be
very
drinkable
while
also
be
somewhat
tasty
snobs
will
scoff
newbies
will
love
it
and
old
vets
will
find
it
to
be
an
impeccable
session
beer
d
not
bad
very
good
warm
weather
beer
this
white
ale
hits
the
spot
its
a
style
id
expect
to
be
very
drinkable
though
once
the
temperatures
turn
up
it
would
be
easy
to
spend
a
night
with
these
but
i
cant
argue
with
the
choice
to
go
with
noble
pils
this
was
probably
getting
crushed
by
blue
moon
and
id
probably
even
take
that
over
this
simple
thirst
quencher
but
nothing
to
seek
out
notes
recommended
i
really
enjoy
this
brew
the
spiciness
adds
a
pleasing
and
unique
dimension
not
that
other
beers
arent
spiced
this
combination
just
seems
to
work
well
peppery
grains
of
paradise
citrus
rind
coriander
and
a
musty
poundcake
sweet
malt
aroma
smooth
almost
creamy
body
with
a
crisp
wheaty
snap
in
back
orange
citrus
and
lemon
shortbread
with
a
dry
finish
ddefinitely
sits
light
in
the
stomach
very
drinkable
d
pretty
drinkable
not
great
but
it
does
taste
pretty
good
and
goes
down
easy
drinks
average
other
than
the
winter
samplers
i
certainly
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
with
low
carbonation
and
an
almost
watery
feel
from
the
light
body
drinkability
was
just
alright
for
me
as
this
beer
was
good
but
nothing
special
as
i
find
most
witbiers
its
just
not
a
style
im
crazy
about
d
not
out
of
the
ordinary
but
really
well
done
not
the
most
traditional
and
rustic
look
however
the
flavor
is
spot
on
some
might
consider
it
a
sort
of
entrylevel
or
starter
wit
i
actually
like
this
far
better
than
heavily
doneup
versions
very
drinkable
samuel
adams
white
ale
thoroughly
unimpressed
me
way
to
bland
for
my
taste
would
not
recommend
or
purchase
again
overall
as
i
remembered
from
years
past
i
used
think
this
was
a
pretty
bad
interpretation
of
a
wit
but
this
one
wasnt
bad
more
phenolic
than
i
remember
and
less
cloyingly
sweet
on
the
finish
is
it
possible
that
they
have
modified
the
recipe
or
yeast
i
would
say
that
it
was
much
better
than
i
had
expected
an
other
unexciting
uninspired
parforthecourse
brew
from
sam
adams
although
they
are
known
to
experiment
with
some
of
their
limited
releases
this
variety
pack
of
classic
styles
ive
been
working
through
draws
neatly
between
the
lines
this
guy
is
boring
but
as
always
absolutely
unoffensive
id
gladly
drink
it
if
it
was
around
but
i
am
not
going
out
of
my
way
for
it
pours
hazy
straw
color
with
a
slight
orange
tint
and
a
tight
white
head
not
getting
a
whole
lot
of
smell
from
this
one
but
what
i
do
get
is
grainy
sweetness
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
tartfunky
yeast
taste
is
heavy
on
wheat
and
grain
notes
the
malt
profile
is
cereallike
and
there
are
some
good
citrus
notes
in
the
background
theres
a
tingling
tartness
on
the
front
and
bottom
of
the
tongue
very
smooth
its
one
of
the
easiestdrinking
beers
ive
ever
had
sam
adams
did
a
pretty
spoton
job
with
this
one
id
maybe
like
a
little
bit
more
of
the
yeast
in
the
flavor
but
thats
just
personal
preference
all
in
all
a
solid
offering
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
i
would
drink
again
pours
a
light
golden
honey
color
two
finger
lacing
and
some
spider
web
lacing
good
looking
witbeer
smeels
of
citrus
and
malt
ditto
on
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
high
would
definitly
buy
this
again
very
good
beer
good
example
of
the
style
pretty
good
beer
but
there
are
plenty
of
better
wits
out
there
very
approachable
beer
if
you
enjoy
other
sam
adams
brews
overall
a
great
utilitarian
wit
nothing
to
ponder
just
gulp
and
grin
a
very
good
rendition
of
the
styles
texture
and
appearance
just
wished
there
was
a
bit
more
presence
of
tartcitrus
notes
in
the
flavor
good
brew
for
the
soft
days
of
springtime
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
a
bit
lively
on
the
tongue
overall
i
wouldnt
call
this
the
best
white
ale
on
the
market
but
it
can
hold
its
own
dont
know
if
there
was
a
change
in
the
recipe
over
the
last
few
years
but
im
a
lot
happier
with
this
one
overall
its
not
bad
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
but
getting
a
few
in
mixed
packs
is
fine
by
me
it
may
no
longer
be
the
spirng
seasonal
but
it
has
enough
redeeming
qualities
to
remain
in
the
bbc
stable
d
with
some
other
disappointments
from
the
sam
adams
winter
box
im
quite
ok
with
this
i
dont
think
its
completely
true
to
style
but
it
is
a
good
drink
id
recommend
to
any
of
my
casual
drinking
friends
poured
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
also
kept
a
nice
lace
throughout
it
was
bright
with
just
enough
carbonation
i
could
smell
the
spices
as
stated
on
the
bottle
i
wish
the
taste
was
a
little
stronger
but
overall
it
had
a
good
taste
with
the
spices
showing
through
again
although
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
exactly
what
the
spices
tasted
like
it
definitely
was
not
a
citrus
taste
more
like
clove
maybe
slightly
bitter
and
more
grassy
tasting
was
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
left
no
aftertaste
d
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
or
glass
of
beer
more
accurately
overall
not
a
bad
attempt
at
the
style
but
no
where
near
the
top
of
the
pack
d
i
could
drink
several
for
sure
its
light
and
non
aggressive
without
the
lightbeer
feel
overall
this
is
a
solid
white
ale
offering
from
sa
nice
and
light
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
this
in
the
oklahoma
summer
time
great
beer
to
have
sitting
outside
having
a
bbq
d
well
done
drinks
well
at
a
range
of
temperatures
and
is
complex
enough
to
enjoy
understated
enough
to
serve
with
food
and
just
light
enough
to
be
refreshing
good
stuff
not
quite
a
belgian
wit
but
rather
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
high
overall
a
decent
example
of
the
style
pours
a
golden
light
amber
head
is
impressive
and
is
bright
white
and
pillowy
lots
of
lacing
smells
a
little
bit
grainy
yeasty
smells
like
a
wheat
beer
taste
surprised
me
more
flavor
than
i
thought
spices
are
apparent
but
do
not
dominate
yeast
and
carbonation
do
a
good
job
of
making
this
a
very
drinkable
white
ale
overall
i
was
quite
a
bit
let
down
by
this
one
would
not
pick
this
one
up
again
was
waiting
for
the
unusual
spices
and
they
just
didnt
show
up
taste
decent
a
little
chewier
than
expected
one
of
the
more
dense
white
ales
lots
of
that
clove
spice
you
either
love
or
hate
usually
lemon
orange
very
carbonated
not
my
favorite
beer
out
of
the
variety
pack
by
far
1
failure
white
ale
d
low
this
is
not
very
good
at
all
however
i
could
see
its
appeal
to
a
mostly
bmc
crowd
which
might
excuse
its
inclusion
in
an
otherwise
great
winter
sampler
pack
d
easily
drinkable
and
a
pretty
tasty
brew
d
a
decent
witbier
id
have
another
verdict
not
a
bad
wheat
beer
pretty
good
balance
of
flavor
and
everything
is
light
and
meshes
well
another
decent
samuel
adams
brew
dive
had
better
alt
beers
than
this
too
carbonated
for
me
finishes
a
little
too
dry
not
something
ild
go
out
of
my
way
for
a
pretty
decent
witbier
definitely
has
that
american
wit
feel
like
blue
moon
it
doesnt
feel
authentic
not
bad
though
it
seems
overly
sweet
a
slightly
above
average
wit
good
balance
between
ingredients
amazing
texture
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
beer
is
a
generic
white
ale
nothing
bad
about
it
nothing
really
that
great
i
will
say
that
it
is
better
than
the
sam
adams
coastal
wheat
which
was
not
good
at
all
it
has
a
nice
wheat
presence
and
good
citrus
flavor
a
nice
color
and
the
drinkability
isnt
bad
its
just
an
ok
beer
nothing
to
really
talk
about
other
than
that
its
just
an
average
wheat
beer
drinkability
medium
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
perfect
pint
glass
and
it
has
a
light
pale
orange
color
body
with
not
a
lot
of
head
but
a
nice
lace
around
the
edge
the
smell
is
of
lemon
and
coriander
the
taste
is
of
nice
wheat
and
citrus
hops
it
is
nice
a
smooth
off
the
tongue
and
leaves
a
nice
after
taste
and
is
very
drinkable
drinkability
purchased
in
the
sam
adams
holiday
sampler
i
feel
like
this
is
the
changeup
pitch
thrown
in
with
the
bocks
porters
lagers
and
winter
warmers
a
solid
beer
in
its
style
but
nothing
spectacular
would
be
more
drinkable
in
warmer
weather
say
at
the
ballpark
done
of
my
least
favorite
sam
beers
to
date
not
undrinkable
by
any
means
for
the
style
but
lots
of
flaws
and
extremely
simple
in
flavor
hazy
orange
brew
white
head
with
poor
retention
and
minimal
lacing
fresh
citrus
aromas
big
citrus
flavors
mostly
orange
but
some
mango
and
apricot
are
there
as
well
acidic
and
slightly
sour
mild
wheat
flavors
in
the
background
minimal
grassy
hop
medium
in
body
well
carbonated
and
a
creamy
texture
pretty
standard
for
a
wit
but
tasty
and
satisfying
just
the
same
d
the
hot
peppery
spiciness
gives
me
a
little
heart
burn
feeling
so
one
at
a
time
is
enough
for
me
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
the
people
at
the
boston
beer
company
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
but
for
some
of
the
flavor
irregularities
i
prefer
a
little
bit
sweeter
of
a
witbier
with
less
of
a
grainy
aftertaste
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
though
da
very
easygoing
beer
but
this
just
isnt
my
style
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
of
these
some
afternoon
but
i
would
use
this
beer
in
place
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
something
not
very
complicated
that
i
dont
have
to
think
about
while
drinking
one
of
sammys
best
regular
style
beers
along
with
the
noble
pils
and
a
couple
others
i
am
forgetting
drinkability
decent
brew
in
a
different
style
real
easy
to
drink
but
i
can
tell
you
that
every
time
ive
had
it
i
have
been
left
somewhat
underwhelmed
worth
a
try
at
least
particularly
if
you
are
making
the
circuit
of
boston
beer
company
brews
d
this
had
decent
drinkability
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
it
is
certainly
not
the
best
witbier
ive
ever
had
but
its
a
decent
beer
overall
drinkability
this
beer
doesnt
seem
to
pull
of
the
traditional
approachmentality
that
bb
usually
caters
to
im
not
tasting
enough
of
the
belgian
history
decent
tasting
but
not
terribly
complex
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
creamy
overall
a
pleasant
beer
but
not
an
offering
that
would
otherwise
classify
as
spectacular
sublimely
drinkable
more
interesting
than
most
a
worthy
witbier
from
sams
d
if
you
want
a
beer
that
is
quenching
and
crisp
then
this
is
for
you
fans
of
witbiers
should
enjoy
drinkability
based
on
taste
alone
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
other
than
that
it
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
d
very
pleasurable
to
drink
tasty
and
easy
to
imbibe
its
a
thin
beer
not
creamy
at
all
more
crisp
super
easy
to
drink
but
with
the
interesting
flavor
profiles
im
not
sure
id
want
too
many
in
a
row
a
solid
pleasant
winter
beer
cheers
drinkability
it
comes
from
the
sam
adams
winter
classics
reminds
me
of
an
orange
lemonade
kind
of
a
beer
which
i
would
enjoy
drinking
more
during
the
summer
either
way
its
a
nice
taste
not
a
bad
beer
witbiers
arent
exactly
my
thing
so
im
not
the
best
of
judges
refreshing
and
would
be
a
good
choice
for
warmer
weather
i
believe
pours
a
hazy
goldenrod
although
not
terribly
cloudy
puffy
bubbly
lace
on
top
is
pretty
close
to
pure
white
aroma
is
orange
peel
yeasty
grainy
i
guess
there
are
spices
there
but
only
because
the
label
says
so
this
beer
doesnt
taste
like
a
whole
lot
subtle
fruit
flavors
banana
lemon
not
very
wheaty
slightly
tangy
eh
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
is
entirely
forgettable
d
a
very
enjoyable
american
style
witbier
refreshing
during
any
part
of
the
year
an
excellent
beer
to
introduce
folks
to
the
world
of
true
refreshing
beer
while
not
a
phenomenal
representation
of
the
style
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
glad
its
in
the
holiday
packs
light
crisp
mouthfeel
its
not
going
down
the
drain
but
definitely
an
average
beer
body
is
good
for
the
style
and
drinkability
is
ok
hurt
by
the
chemical
aftertaste
notes
well
its
not
too
shaby
but
its
still
tasty
as
it
usually
is
cheer
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
sweet
with
a
medium
body
and
very
very
easy
drinkin
dont
know
why
its
in
the
winter
seasonal
but
it
kinda
fits
its
more
complex
than
blue
moon
im
also
getting
some
floral
notes
reminiscent
of
boston
lager
paired
with
the
citrus
flavor
slightly
doughy
aftertaste
its
balanced
well
though
all
around
overall
id
recommend
you
try
this
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
and
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
other
winter
classics
beers
merry
christmas
drinks
pretty
smooth
with
a
lot
of
fruity
citrus
and
it
is
very
bubbly
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
beer
for
the
spring
time
but
this
is
just
as
good
as
a
winter
my
12ounce
glass
went
to
capacity
and
threatened
to
spill
over
before
creating
a
magnificent
onefinger
mushroomlike
cap
of
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
golden
yellow
that
was
as
foggy
as
my
mind
after
this
afternoon
or
washington
d
c
s
bottom
nose
struck
me
as
more
hoppy
than
spicy
although
i
suddenly
started
sneezing
which
suggests
black
pepper
which
suggests
coriander
in
a
winter
sampler
moving
on
the
mouthfeel
was
big
full
and
rather
thick
given
that
i
have
sensed
this
in
every
beer
this
afternoon
i
wonder
if
it
is
not
something
to
do
with
the
proprietary
yeast
strain
yum
good
finish
was
vinous
bonedry
like
some
white
wines
phew
still
it
did
not
remind
me
of
lhiver
to
confirm
that
i
didnt
have
a
bad
bottle
i
opened
up
the
second
one
a
day
later
still
bad
drain
pour
drinkability
a
decent
wit
certainly
better
than
other
massmarket
witbiers
but
not
at
the
top
of
its
class
d
an
average
witbier
nothing
really
stood
out
to
me
about
it
could
drink
a
few
of
them
but
not
sure
id
want
to
not
one
of
sas
better
beers
d
this
would
be
an
ok
summer
refresher
why
it
was
placed
in
the
winter
sampler
i
have
no
idea
this
beer
is
good
i
have
had
others
with
more
to
offer
flavors
of
pepper
and
grains
of
paradise
as
well
as
lemon
grapefruit
and
banana
this
one
i
like
less
than
other
craft
brewers
more
than
all
the
macro
versions
tastes
like
a
sam
adams
brew
md
a
bit
mellow
for
a
witbier
but
considering
the
intended
audience
i
would
say
it
has
a
good
and
light
feel
and
improved
drinkability
for
the
mass
craft
market
all
in
all
a
decent
but
not
great
beer
both
in
style
and
allaround
i
wouldnt
be
going
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
would
rather
have
this
in
the
spring
than
the
winter
part
of
the
winter
mix
pack
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
gold
a
thin
white
head
rest
atop
fair
retention
left
some
good
lace
behind
the
nose
is
pretty
basic
some
light
spices
wet
hay
citrus
zest
smooth
feel
with
a
crisp
bite
on
the
finish
some
faint
citrus
like
lemon
and
orange
in
the
flavor
more
bready
than
anticipated
this
isnt
one
of
the
more
spicy
wits
out
there
but
it
hits
the
spot
also
im
not
sure
this
is
the
season
for
this
style
but
no
matter
a
good
beer
just
not
necessarily
a
good
witbier
d
drinks
easy
very
bland
and
plain
could
easily
drink
a
few
but
not
going
to
seeing
i
only
got
two
in
the
12
pack
winter
special
overallnotes
witbier
is
a
relatively
popular
style
what
with
blue
moon
and
hoegaardens
success
they
knew
this
when
the
brewed
the
beer
and
it
shows
i
wouldnt
say
its
a
brew
for
the
extremists
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
one
to
kick
back
with
while
chatting
it
up
thisll
do
slight
revision
with
retasting
in
sept
2011
i
got
this
in
their
winter
variety
case
pours
a
cloudy
copper
orange
the
nose
is
nice
smell
of
wheat
and
citrus
and
a
bit
of
yeast
as
well
the
taste
however
misses
for
me
really
i
only
get
citrus
up
front
with
lingering
sweetness
otherwise
the
body
is
real
thin
if
it
wasnt
for
the
good
carbonation
this
one
would
be
an
epic
fail
not
totally
bad
but
i
would
buy
a
whole
bunch
of
these
d
solid
drinkability
tried
it
on
tap
in
a
bar
the
beer
is
hazy
gold
color
aroma
is
citrus
yeast
and
some
spice
body
is
light
to
medium
the
tartness
is
pronounced
flavor
of
citrus
and
spice
with
a
touch
of
banana
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
i
would
try
again
d
overall
very
drinkable
not
quite
a
beer
to
ponder
but
a
very
good
american
wheat
not
overly
spiced
like
some
of
the
macrobrewed
wheats
blue
moon
shock
top
md
crisp
and
easy
drinking
but
overall
not
amazing
its
not
bad
but
just
didnt
have
it
everything
about
this
is
mediocre
ill
drink
it
in
the
samplers
but
thats
about
it
definitely
could
be
worse
though
d
a
decent
witbier
some
off
flavors
but
otherwise
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
not
really
what
i
would
want
for
the
wintertime
however
so
i
find
the
name
and
time
of
the
year
this
is
released
rather
odd
this
is
more
fitting
the
spirngsummertime
better
d
crisp
and
smooth
light
drinks
easily
a
good
summer
quencher
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
belgian
classic
very
good
white
ale
ive
had
a
few
better
but
this
more
than
meets
my
expectations
for
the
style
and
would
be
a
great
session
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
orange
pepper
coriander
and
something
that
resembles
cough
syrup
the
flavor
is
juicy
oranges
with
some
grass
and
coriander
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
syrupy
and
is
very
sweet
overall
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
bad
but
not
one
of
the
better
samuel
adams
beers
d
would
be
a
good
summer
quencher
i
still
dont
know
why
this
made
it
in
the
winter
sampler
from
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
soft
hoppycitrus
scent
tastes
like
a
very
citrusy
wheat
beer
very
citrus
feeling
to
it
almost
like
drinking
a
sprite
first
beer
ive
had
of
this
style
cant
wait
to
try
more
like
it
and
cant
wait
to
tell
my
friends
about
this
one
a
good
winter
beer
and
very
drinkable
during
the
holiday
season
this
really
tastes
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
witbier
overall
good
beer
overall
this
isnt
something
i
would
expect
to
be
included
in
a
winter
sampler
i
think
it
would
make
an
excellent
summer
beer
definitely
worth
trying
a
good
introduction
beer
to
the
wit
style
the
beer
has
the
traditional
flavors
of
a
wit
but
quite
subdued
drinkability
you
can
drink
it
but
its
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
witbier
too
heavy
unnecessarily
bitter
drinkability
an
good
witbier
better
than
many
but
not
outstanding
my
favorite
aspect
of
the
beer
is
the
apriclot
taste
a
decent
beer
but
not
something
i
would
buy
if
others
were
available
d
chuggable
if
thats
your
thing
d
decent
aftertaste
got
old
after
a
while
drinks
like
a
champ
only
downfall
is
the
sam
adams
patented
cloyality
d
other
than
the
chocolate
bock
i
enjoyed
this
one
second
most
of
the
variety
pack
something
about
citrus
and
yeast
in
an
american
beer
that
just
clashes
great
in
this
loved
it
dvery
drinkable
incredibly
smooth
easily
a
session
beer
this
isnt
what
id
expect
from
a
winter
beer
but
is
still
nice
its
a
much
lighter
one
and
fits
in
nicely
with
the
other
sam
adams
seasonals
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
to
copper
color
minimal
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
bright
wheat
aromas
refreshingly
malty
and
some
lemony
citrus
notes
flavor
mostly
of
wheat
malt
maybe
a
touch
of
coriander
and
citrus
crisp
and
clean
tasting
but
lacking
in
any
depth
light
to
medium
bodied
mostly
dry
good
beer
but
what
is
it
doing
in
the
sam
adams
winter
pack
d
very
drinkable
beer
the
flavors
are
nice
and
smooth
and
balanced
even
with
the
fairly
light
body
the
finish
could
be
a
bit
more
balanced
but
the
fruityspicy
combination
is
nice
db
pretty
enjoyable
witbier
my
only
gripe
is
it
does
feel
somewhat
straightforward
or
cheap
for
some
reason
the
flavors
feel
separated
rather
than
melded
into
a
smooth
experience
drinkability
the
bitter
orange
ending
wants
more
not
quite
sure
how
this
ended
up
in
their
winter
seasonal
mix
pack
but
im
not
really
going
to
complain
i
dont
consider
it
a
winter
brew
but
i
love
wheat
beers
enough
to
drink
them
year
round
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
though
it
could
stand
to
be
more
flavorful
d
certainly
easy
to
drink
but
i
was
expecting
more
kick
to
it
overall
good
really
smooth
beer
probably
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
of
but
its
ok
perfectly
clear
grade
a
honey
color
with
a
1
5
white
head
that
diminished
quickly
leaving
a
scant
ring
but
laced
very
nicely
while
it
lasted
a
strong
pilsner
malt
aroma
that
characteristic
breadish
smell
quite
a
bit
of
metallic
tones
here
i
could
be
confusing
this
with
citrus
notes
but
regardless
its
a
tiny
bit
off
putting
very
light
coriander
as
well
touch
of
honey
overall
aroma
is
delicate
but
decently
balanced
flavors
are
well
melded
and
coincide
with
the
aroma
but
without
the
metallic
tones
and
more
of
the
bready
cereal
malt
notes
in
the
finish
somewhat
of
a
lightmedium
body
perhaps
a
little
heavier
than
id
like
in
a
witbier
but
well
carbonated
and
crisp
i
just
drank
both
of
them
in
about
a
40
minute
time
span
so
id
say
its
pretty
drinkable
not
something
id
buy
in
a
6
pack
it
happened
to
be
in
the
variety
pack
so
i
decided
to
drink
them
from
a
bottle
with
an
expiration
date
of
march
2011
the
pour
is
a
milky
pale
yellow
with
busy
carbonation
but
virtually
no
head
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
thin
but
exhibits
a
citrus
doughy
character
there
was
little
in
the
way
of
wheat
the
body
comes
in
at
about
medium
the
taste
is
mild
with
more
of
a
wheatlike
base
vague
spices
and
thin
hops
drinkable
enough
but
nothing
overwhelming
dhigh
if
one
were
to
session
with
a
witte
this
would
be
it
the
aroma
has
a
bit
of
funk
or
maybe
adjuncts
because
there
is
a
card
board
quality
to
it
there
is
also
some
citrus
and
malt
but
they
seem
to
be
hidden
the
appearance
is
amber
gold
with
a
medium
head
but
not
cloudy
enough
for
a
white
ale
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
better
finish
and
a
funkier
taste
up
front
the
palate
is
average
overall
a
drinkable
beer
d
not
bad
really
the
spices
work
better
in
the
flavor
than
they
do
in
the
aroma
all
i
get
from
the
smell
is
musty
hay
and
a
little
spice
but
the
flavor
has
more
citrus
and
some
nice
peppery
notes
there
are
some
hops
in
the
finish
that
keep
things
balanced
and
work
pretty
well
with
the
pepper
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
have
to
admit
that
it
is
a
pretty
decent
attempt
the
aroma
has
some
room
for
improvement
but
overall
it
is
really
better
than
i
ever
gave
it
credit
for
this
slightly
cloudy
beer
produces
a
one
finger
head
when
poured
lacing
is
minimal
with
moderate
cling
color
is
a
6
on
the
srm
color
chart
aromas
of
lime
orange
wheat
and
corn
flavors
are
many
and
seem
to
change
with
each
sip
i
detect
orange
lime
vanilla
black
pepper
cinnamon
wheat
and
malt
not
bad
feeling
in
my
mouth
would
like
a
little
more
but
not
bad
i
like
the
flavor
enchanting
and
changing
very
refreshing
and
not
bad
on
the
wallet
poured
semiaggressive
into
standard
nonic
for
a
1finger
head
that
disappears
into
nothing
carbonation
is
light
bubbles
in
the
runny
lacing
are
rather
small
color
is
cloudy
straw
gold
with
a
punch
of
orange
off
the
bat
aroma
brings
out
an
orange
citrus
that
is
found
in
blue
moon
so
i
suppose
an
orange
wedge
would
be
an
appropriate
addition
for
those
that
prefer
it
brewed
with
spices
spices
well
not
in
the
aroma
other
than
light
brown
sugar
i
would
have
expected
some
coriander
maybe
its
there
i
just
dont
smell
or
taste
it
other
aroma
of
light
wheat
flavor
is
pleasant
taste
is
bursting
with
orange
peel
and
wheat
no
other
spices
tasted
probably
a
good
session
beer
for
wheat
beer
lovers
lightbodied
beer
with
a
dab
of
sour
aftertaste
mouthfeel
very
light
with
minimal
carbonation
drinkability
is
reasonably
high
it
has
more
flavor
than
bmc
and
is
incredibly
sessionable
though
not
overly
flavorful
overall
d
this
generally
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
which
is
why
i
tried
this
one
first
out
of
the
samuel
adams
winter
pack
but
i
was
actually
surprised
and
didnt
mind
it
at
all
there
wasnt
anything
too
overpowering
i
wont
mind
having
the
second
one
out
of
the
pack
taste
again
is
very
classic
very
well
balanced
and
spicy
with
a
nice
yeast
note
to
it
thats
crisp
and
quite
dry
on
the
finish
theres
almost
a
peppery
finish
on
the
back
of
the
palate
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
creamy
with
a
pretty
sharp
carbonation
that
makes
it
crisp
and
easy
drinking
a
duller
honey
color
with
fine
foamy
head
mildly
hazy
soft
bready
aroma
with
some
bananas
and
soft
spices
aroma
is
faint
taste
is
a
little
tart
with
a
distinct
spice
finish
bananas
and
some
grass
apparent
too
pretty
tasty
overall
a
totally
decent
winter
wheat
beer
sa
white
ale
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
slender
16oz
sa
white
ale
witbier
glass
pours
a
golden
hazy
color
thats
highly
carbonated
with
a
very
nice
off
white
pillow
2
12
head
decent
retention
and
excellent
lacing
left
on
the
sides
smells
kinda
sweet
with
a
nice
citrus
aroma
of
lemon
and
assorted
spices
taste
like
a
somewhat
weak
wheat
ale
and
has
the
same
vibe
as
the
summer
ale
and
coastal
wheat
of
which
both
i
hate
very
clean
mouth
feel
and
taste
despite
all
the
spice
going
on
here
the
high
carbonation
probably
helps
push
most
of
that
aside
overall
a
decent
brew
but
definatly
doesnt
deserve
a
spot
in
the
sa
winter
classics
pack
would
recommend
as
a
spring
deal
and
especially
to
women
looking
for
a
lighter
more
flavorful
beer
poured
into
a
pint
glass
cloudy
yellow
with
a
white
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
i
love
the
aspect
that
its
unfiltered
powerful
wheat
grainy
and
lemon
essence
it
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
i
cant
see
what
makes
this
an
ale
besides
that
it
was
brewed
with
ale
yeast
its
a
step
above
a
decent
adjunct
beer
i
guess
this
is
just
not
my
style
of
beer
but
i
respect
it
for
what
it
is
this
beer
pours
a
kinda
of
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
did
stay
through
out
the
beer
it
has
a
sharp
wheat
and
lemon
smell
the
taste
is
a
gradual
increase
of
the
wheat
flavors
and
some
lemon
as
well
strong
wheat
taste
very
nicely
carbondated
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
how
a
wheat
beer
should
taste
like
overall
a
really
good
beer
one
of
the
better
american
witbiers
out
there
i
would
like
to
see
this
one
maybe
replace
the
summer
ale
pours
a
slightly
hazy
dull
golden
color
with
an
averaged
sized
fizzy
head
head
is
white
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
really
no
lacing
to
speak
of
scent
is
a
bit
of
wheat
and
grainy
notes
with
a
lot
of
citrus
peel
scents
taste
is
lots
of
citrus
notes
and
an
almost
cloying
sweetness
with
the
wheat
and
grainy
notes
mostly
in
the
background
cant
really
taste
any
sort
of
spices
outside
of
the
citrus
peels
mouthfeel
is
also
a
bit
lacking
doesnt
have
the
effervescent
kind
of
carbonation
i
expected
i
feel
like
this
one
pretty
much
misses
the
mark
in
every
category
that
defines
the
style
12oz
bottle
with
a
best
before
date
of
feb
pours
a
murky
straw
color
with
strands
of
some
kind
of
darker
mass
floating
around
the
middle
some
lacing
aromas
of
spice
grains
malts
and
lemon
zest
a
bit
too
much
spice
and
a
bit
too
floral
for
my
taste
this
is
not
a
beer
i
will
be
drinking
again
i
guess
i
will
have
to
choke
it
down
if
i
grab
another
winter
classics
mix
pack
da
waste
of
time
calories
and
money
considering
it
is
such
a
poor
representation
of
the
style
even
outside
of
the
classification
this
is
a
poor
beer
and
the
worst
of
the
winter
box
this
was
part
of
the
sam
adams
winter
collection
and
this
is
one
that
i
would
take
to
a
holiday
party
and
hope
the
other
guests
finish
it
the
spicing
is
spot
on
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
could
use
something
namely
a
more
assertive
malt
and
yeast
character
d
love
this
one
as
well
it
has
no
complaints
it
doesnt
stand
out
enormously
but
it
doesnt
sit
at
an
average
brew
either
id
drink
it
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
in
the
sam
adams
pack
the
alcohol
is
not
an
issue
it
doesnt
add
much
to
the
conversation
samuel
adams
white
ale
is
a
cloudy
golden
ale
with
a
thick
dense
soft
white
head
that
has
excellent
retention
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
notes
of
lemon
fruit
spice
and
possibly
wood
it
has
a
pretty
light
body
and
is
quite
smooth
and
dry
the
finish
is
dry
and
papery
it
tastes
fresh
and
lemony
and
reasonably
bitter
with
a
note
of
hay
there
is
a
lingering
light
grassy
bitterness
its
a
light
and
easy
beer
thats
not
entirely
boring
i
agree
with
the
opinions
that
i
have
heard
that
this
one
is
a
curious
addition
to
a
winter
sampler
but
i
rather
enjoyed
it
the
appearance
is
only
slightly
cloudy
with
a
yelloworange
color
and
a
foamy
eggshellcolored
head
the
aroma
presents
a
big
banana
character
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
clove
the
spiced
character
is
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
along
with
more
of
the
light
banana
cream
and
mild
yeast
flavors
that
were
noticeable
in
the
aroma
the
texture
is
finely
carbonated
but
a
little
prickly
which
doesnt
quite
mesh
with
the
light
creamy
flavors
overall
i
found
this
one
light
and
pleasant
and
i
would
happily
have
a
few
more
you
know
its
fine
considering
its
origins
the
brewery
i
mean
aint
a
hoegaarden
but
i
have
a
feeling
it
beats
blue
moon
d
3
no
idea
why
this
is
in
a
winter
sampler
pack
just
to
carry
on
the
spicing
theme
a
wit
makes
me
think
of
summer
mainly
but
maybe
im
a
wacko
nevertheless
drinkable
depending
on
the
mood
not
often
in
the
mood
for
something
like
this
though
d
i
cant
say
ill
be
looking
for
another
anytime
soon
but
will
finish
this
one
all
in
all
this
one
was
a
bit
onedimensional
and
disappointing
nothing
memorable
other
than
the
somewhat
lackluster
aroma
and
run
of
the
mill
flavor
given
most
of
the
other
sam
adams
offerings
im
surprised
by
this
one
finally
at
the
end
of
the
winter
styles
pack
it
pours
a
pretty
clear
amberlemon
topped
by
about
a
halffinger
or
so
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
peel
coriander
wheat
light
lemon
grass
flowers
very
light
cedar
and
a
touch
of
soil
the
taste
sides
mostly
with
the
citrus
notes
particularly
the
orange
peel
lemon
zest
and
coriander
some
earthy
and
floral
hop
notes
find
their
way
in
there
as
well
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
partially
watery
feel
overall
an
ok
wit
fairly
solid
in
most
respects
but
just
a
tad
too
bland
to
really
engage
me
so
to
speak
something
like
that
this
beer
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
a
solid
beer
not
sure
why
its
in
the
winter
mix
pack
thoughit
would
be
better
off
in
a
spring
or
summer
pack
final
notes
this
should
be
more
of
a
summer
beer
than
a
winter
beer
so
why
theyre
doing
it
in
the
winter
classics
pack
i
have
no
idea
a
decent
witbier
but
belongs
in
a
different
season
taste
of
mostly
coriander
and
orange
peel
among
wheat
malts
and
a
light
body
there
is
high
carbonation
and
just
a
little
bit
of
citrus
mixing
with
pale
wheat
malts
relatively
straight
forward
and
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
good
witbier
one
that
you
could
probably
session
if
you
felt
in
the
mood
for
a
wit
drinkability
a
pretty
decent
and
flavorful
witbier
certainly
not
the
best
out
there
but
still
very
enjoyable
i
am
a
bit
confused
as
to
why
bbc
opted
to
include
this
in
the
winter
mixed
pack
rather
than
the
summer
mixed
pack
but
i
think
confusing
decisions
in
these
mixed
packs
are
par
for
the
course
now
glad
i
finally
got
to
try
it
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
if
it
is
in
a
sampler
pack
or
given
to
me
by
a
friend
than
i
would
drink
it
d
definitely
a
nice
and
drinkable
wit
nothing
to
exciting
just
another
very
solid
beer
from
bbc
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
excellant
retention
just
a
small
amount
of
lacing
is
left
behind
aroma
of
orange
zest
and
other
citrus
wheat
malt
really
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
well
not
nearly
as
highly
spiced
as
other
wits
mostly
wheaty
flavor
with
some
faint
citrus
and
spice
nothing
really
identifiable
quite
boring
by
witbier
standards
light
body
and
nicely
carbonated
in
the
end
this
is
a
wit
aimed
at
the
masses
nothing
here
to
offend
anyone
but
not
enough
to
make
it
interesting
either
d
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
but
wouldnt
go
down
to
the
store
to
find
it

at
fred
meyer
in
ballard
seattle
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
and
is
something
of
a
late
winter
beer
that
gets
you
ready
for
spring
and
the
warmer
months
the
spices
give
is
a
nice
poppy
flavor
while
the
light
body
is
a
rest
from
other
winter
beers
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
white
ale
i
tend
to
like
my
white
ales
heavier
in
the
spice
department
i
wouldnt
seek
this
beer
out
but
would
drink
it
if
i
was
offered
one
overall
a
mediocre
brew
d
good
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
wit
nothing
amazing
but
not
shabby
either
better
than
a
lot
of
other
witbiers
out
there
notes
part
of
the
2010
winter
pack
an
above
average
beer
that
isnt
a
bad
witbier
but
there
are
definitely
better
ones
stronger
citrus
for
others
in
the
style
overall
i
thought
this
was
nice
but
if
it
were
apart
from
the
winter
pack
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
on
its
own
notes
got
this
in
the
sam
adams
winter
sampler
why
overall
there
are
a
lot
of
shortcomings
for
this
beer
as
a
white
ale
but
its
a
pretty
decent
totally
drinkable
beer
d
this
ale
exhibits
nice
balance
and
is
a
nice
counterweight
to
the
overly
spiced
beers
that
appear
this
time
of
year
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
mellow
hefeweissen
its
tasty
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
too
fizzy
for
me
this
is
a
solid
beer

with

color
smell
is
predominately

lemon
orange
as
well
as
some

i
cant

the
taste
follows

lemon

wheat
and
a
bit
of
pepper
spiciness
in
the
finish
medium

well
carbonated
and
a
dry
finish
its
a
nice
beer
i
just
wish
it
remained
a
spring
release
would
be
really
refreshing
in
early
mid
may
but
not
having
the
same
effect
on
me
in
the
middle
of
november
my
main
complaint
is
that
it
is
only
in
the
winter
pack
this
is
a
very
delicious
beer
an
underappreciated
member
of
the
winter
pack
from
sa
i
dont
find
this
style
all
that
appealing
i
favor
hefeweizens
this
particular
example
just
doesnt
pop
wow
or
refresh
drinkability
just
from
personal
opinion
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
summer
day
or
even
into
fall
but
this
just
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
very
drinkable
brew
in
the
winter
although
it
serves
a
great
contrast
to
many
of
the
seasonal
beers
during
fall
and
winter
very
drinkable
i
guess
it
would
just
depend
on
the
mood
im
in
the
is
a
beer
i
find
very
drinkable
and
inviting
to
those
who
maybe
dont
get
down
with
stronger
more
full
bodied
beers
and
styles
such
as
imperial
stouts
and
the
like
i
could
drink
this
all
day
long
and
would
probably
be
happy
to
subside
off
of
it
for
a
week
straight
with
pleasure
okay
that
last
part
is
a
joke
p
d
pretty
drinkable
would
be
better
as
a
crisp
springsummer
beer
but
i
certainly
wont
turn
it
down
now
dabout
as
close
to
a
drain
pour
as
possible
i
just
did
not
get
along
with
this
beer
sam
adams
thank
you
for
changing
the
spring
seasonal
to
the
noble
pils
you
still
shouldve
left
this
out
of
the
winter
package
and
never
made
this
again
overall
a
light
a
refreshing
brew
with
a
nice
background
flavor
to
it
why
its
in
the
holiday
pack
i
dont
know
but
this
would
be
nice
out
on
a
boat
fishing
in
the
summer
d
well
balanced
nothing
overpowering
its
pretty
tame
and
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
crisp
but
nothing
extraordinary
overall
white
ale
reminds
me
a
lot
of
summer
ale
both
beers
are
lighter
wheat
beers
that
share
many
of
the
same
ingredients
white
ale
tones
the
spice
level
down
and
seems
to
replace
the
lemon
with
orange
i
think
this
beer
balances
the
flavors
out
a
bit
better
honestly
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
these
two
beers
from
one
another
overall
its
okay
an
odd
choice
i
think
for
the
winter
variety
pack
but
not
terrible
standing
alone
its
pretty
average
and
i
doubt
id
want
another
overall
impression
seems
a
little
too
spiced
and
artifical
to
be
a
true
witbier
still
the
spice
notes
work
well
for
the
winter
a
nice
replacement
to
the
cranberry
lambic
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
foam
head
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
lemon
citrus
hops
coriander
wheat
and
a
hefty
amount
of
grass
there
is
just
too
much
earthiness
for
my
liking
that
continues
in
the
flavor
as
well
the
grass
is
toned
down
but
there
is
a
pepper
note
that
replaces
it
and
continues
to
disappoint
me
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
pretty
good
crisp
and
bubbly
on
the
tongue
maybe
even
too
much
so
the
beer
is
good
but
its
not
nearly
one
of
my
favorites
not
the
best
beer
from
sams
by
far
but
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
the
worst
if
you
like
earthy
spice
i
say
go
for
it
if
you
dont
i
say
pull
something
else
out
of
the
pack
d
this
is
an
ok
wit
in
my
book
the
light
body
and
low
abv
make
it
an
easy
drinker
d
nothing
i
will
probably
buy
again
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
pretty
good
for
a
witbier
nothing
id
pick
out
but
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
reminds
me
of
the
normal
blue
moon
although
id
say
this
is
definitely
better
drinkability
not
too
bad
and
can
be
rather
sessionable
at
times
went
good
with
a
breaded
tilapia
filet
and
vegetables
and
i
think
it
would
be
okay
on
its
own
i
could
have
another
but
there
are
other
witbiers
i
think
i
prefer
over
this
one
still
its
quite
drinkable
the
drinkability
on
this
brew
is
solid
as
stated
above
as
well
as
through
other
reviews
present
on
thsi
brew
its
quite
refreshing
if
the
carbonination
isnt
has
strong
on
other
bottles
this
brew
is
a
great
session
beer
when
ever
you
want
to
enjoy
it
a
pretty
decent
brew
by
samual
adams
once
again
drinkability
this
came
in
a
winter
sampler
12pack
and
i
doubt
i
drink
the
other
one
this
beer
was
a
huge
surprise
to
me
probably
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
so
far
and
a
beer
id
love
to
go
back
to
if
it
were
offered
in
sixpacks
during
the
summer
orange
hop
citrus
a
hint
of
nutmeg
a
bit
stale
and
yeasty
little
aftertaste
and
lightly
carbonated
smells
like
coriander
with
a
fruity
flowery
smell
reminds
me
of
a
way
better
smelling
blue
moon
taste
way
better
too
this
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
to
it
with
these
nice
spices
mixing
in
with
that
cereal
like
wheat
malt
i
can
definitely
tell
why
this
would
be
a
perfect
spring
beer
very
light
hops
in
the
back
taste
of
this
too
its
good
because
although
it
has
those
spices
and
flower
like
flavors
it
still
maintains
a
beer
like
quality
to
remind
you
its
not
just
some
straight
spice
drink
this
sort
of
reminds
me
of
dogfish
head
namaste
too
but
that
had
more
orange
taste
fruity
taste
where
this
you
can
taste
more
wheat
not
complaining
though
its
a
very
nice
tasting
beer
dont
let
the
white
ale
part
fool
you
this
witbier
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
slight
scent
of
wheat
it
has
a
slight
bitter
taste
like
a
pale
ale
but
very
small
the
spices
are
very
evident
but
blended
nicely
another
great
beer
from
sam
adams
d
this
is
moving
towards
the
top
of
my
list
of
wits
for
me
it
has
a
good
balance
of
flavor
and
goes
down
very
easy
im
a
little
bummed
that
its
only
available
in
the
winter
pack
overall
this
really
is
a
decent
white
ale
i
would
gladly
buy
it
in
a
12
pack
if
it
ever
resurfaces
in
the
spring
hoegaarden
and
st
bernardus
white
remain
my
all
time
favorite
white
ales
but
this
is
definitely
one
to
check
out
d
easy
drinking
although
seems
out
of
season
probably
better
off
during
the
spring
where
it
used
to
be
although
i
do
love
me
some
noble
pils
like
but
dont
love
it
im
not
crazy
about
these
wheat
dominant
beers
but
i
think
sa
white
ale
might
be
one
of
the
better
ones
that
ive
had
pours
hazy
orange
peel
color
with
foamy
white
head
nice
aroma
of
cloves
citrus
some
banana
and
also
a
bit
of
coriander
nice
flavor
to
this
brew
as
it
is
typical
of
this
style
however
the
strength
of
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
not
that
impressive
rather
timid
tastes
of
citrus
and
banana
some
clove
in
the
taste
as
well
but
not
much
overall
a
nice
easy
to
drink
wheat
really
easy
to
drink
however
it
does
leave
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement
on
the
style
the
flavors
just
are
not
quite
as
robust
as
some
of
the
bigger
wheat
beers
out
there
drinkability
either
despite
or
because
of
the
subtle
spicing
this
is
a
very
refreshing
balanced
witbier
some
think
it
is
strange
in
the
winter
pack
and
maybe
it
is
but
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
choice
pours
a
pale
yellow
so
clear
that
i
can
watch
tv
through
the
glass
the
head
is
originally
frothy
and
about
an
inch
thick
but
settles
down
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
citris
like
with
maybe
some
other
spices
present
the
taste
is
overly
citrusy
it
tastes
like
a
slightly
malty
lemonade
more
than
a
beer
maybe
better
in
a
different
seasonal
im
not
sure
why
this
is
in
the
winter
mix
pack
with
a
bunch
of
malt
forward
beers
this
reminds
me
more
of
the
summer
ale
or
the
coastal
wheat
than
anything
pours
a
cloudy
goldenstraw
color
with
a
large
white
head
scent
is
lightly
spicy
and
a
bit
floral
a
bit
of
lemon
as
well
not
a
very
powerful
aroma
the
taste
is
lemon
zest
with
a
bit
of
pepper
light
mint
flavor
as
well
a
little
less
complex
than
other
witbiers
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
a
tasty
beer
its
just
not
super
impressive
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
not
too
light
drinkability
is
fair
drinkability
not
something
id
drink
very
often
but
maybe
twice
a
year
sam
adams
brews
are
always
a
tad
short
on
something
this
beer
is
okay
but
it
lacks
body
and
the
complexity
that
id
expect
out
of
a
witbier
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
the
masses
d
not
much
too
this
brew
i
know
the
flavor
is
meant
to
impact
the
brew
but
there
is
not
much
to
it
drinkability
very
much
so
not
a
half
bad
wit
and
glad
they
unretired
it
despite
them
putting
it
in
the
winter
pack
sa
has
been
putting
out
some
solid
stuff
lately
cant
wait
to
try
the
chocolate
bock
recommended
if
you
can
find
any
remaining
bottles
since
its
retired
among
wheat
beers
these
whites
are
prolific
so
its
tough
to
stand
out
this
one
doesnt
either
but
neither
does
it
come
in
under
the
norm
that
said
it
drinks
clean
and
smooth
quenching
well
so
maybe
it
could
get
lost
in
a
crowd
but
there
are
worse
crowds
to
get
lost
in
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
it
is
an
okay
beer
nothing
stands
out
retired
now
apparently
i
had
thought
this
was
coming
after
the
noble
pils
i
guess
the
noble
pils
replaced
it
while
both
are
good
id
prefer
that
sa
had
stayed
with
the
white
ale
to
be
honest
wow
did
they
retire
this
one
why
its
really
good
yellow
with
a
hint
of
orange
maybe
nice
white
head
smells
like
malt
and
spice
taste
is
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
carbonation
is
just
what
it
should
be
im
sorry
they
retired
it
id
like
to
have
more
of
it
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
great
carbonation
very
crisp
and
drinkable
very
sad
to
see
this
one
go
im
basing
my
drinkability
rating
on
the
beer
when
it
is
fresh
i
cant
recommend
keeping
this
one
more
than
a
couple
of
months
past
release
ive
not
yet
tried
the
noble
pils
i
wasnt
pleased
to
hear
that
white
ale
was
being
replaced
i
looked
forward
to
the
release
of
this
delicious
beer
in
the
spring
i
hope
that
it
will
again
see
the
light
of
day
and
not
be
retired
completely
d
gets
old
fast
not
sure
what
it
is
but
it
seems
as
though
the
ingredients
just
dont
work
together
that
well
drinkablity
i
am
not
a
wheat
beer
fan
but
this
brew
from
boston
brewing
is
pretty
tasty
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
was
flavorful
and
refreshing
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
the
smell
featured
a
solid
yeast
element
with
undertones
of
coriander
the
taste
was
spicy
and
wheaty
with
a
definite
yeast
and
coriander
and
clove
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
full
and
mildly
chewy
overall
a
good
drinkable
white
ale
very
sessionable
pours
burnt
orange
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipates
quick
not
a
lot
of
sediment
for
a
wit
smells
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
a
lot
of
citrus
taste
of
oranges
and
spice
some
pepper
nothing
super
special
mouthfeel
is
tart
and
effervescent
drinkability
is
good
pours
a
semiclowdy
very
light
orange
color
with
less
than
a
finger
head
the
head
receeds
fairly
quick
to
just
a
bit
of
lace
on
top
of
the
beer
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
is
evident
as
well
initially
the
nose
has
a
mild
citrus
aroma
full
of
wheat
and
yeast
carbination
is
a
little
low
on
this
one
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
taste
is
minorly
bitter
with
citruscoriander
up
front
the
finish
is
crisp
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
a
wonderful
session
beer
during
a
hot
day
cloudy
gold
color
with
mild
prickle
light
foam
head
upon
pouring
into
the
glass
the
head
dissipates
over
time
and
leaves
behind
a
wispy
show
of
lacing
malty
nose
with
wheat
like
smell
of
grains
refreshing
attack
but
flattish
flavor
it
really
drops
off
once
its
in
the
mouth
heavy
grain
presence
in
the
flavor
that
underscores
and
effervescent
mouthfeel
there
are
grain
flavors
at
the
finish
and
aftertaste
i
think
that
this
beer
was
too
carbonated
to
fall
into
my
wheelhouse
it
just
didnt
sit
well
with
me
as
stated
already
this
one
is
light
and
refreshing
and
perhaps
a
cut
above
the
brewerys
summer
ale
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
and
is
a
somewhat
decent
example
of
the
witbier
style
though
perhaps
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
d
definitely
drinkable
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
but
im
just
not
a
huge
white
ale
guy
i
did
like
this
a
lot
more
than
ommergang
hennepin
or
hoegaarden
simply
more
relaxed
than
those
two
im
usually
impressed
by
samuel
adams
but
i
have
to
admit
that
with
one
sip
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
kind
of
like
this
website
poured
a
honey
chimay
glassful
couldnt
bring
myself
to
use
a
gay
yank
glass
it
had
very
little
head
or
lacing
as
i
drank
it
i
enjoyed
the
slightly
sweet
lemony
smell
but
the
taste
was
very
blandlike
a
slightly
mutated
lager
mouthfeel
was
average
drinkability
was
average
white
ale
is
extremely
drinkable
and
youll
never
have
a
problem
downing
two
or
three
in
a
single
sitting
ive
done
so
on
many
occasions
i
would
say
that
ive
had
much
better
wheats
but
you
could
do
much
worse
for
your
money
if
youve
never
had
it
then
its
worth
a
go
my
wife
bought
this
beer
for
me
when
looking
for
ommegang
whitte
she
bought
it
by
accident
and
i
was
out
of
a
good
beer
to
drink
i
was
plesantly
surprised
it
was
as
good
as
it
was
i
would
recomned
this
beer
for
a
summer
barbque
or
picnick
with
frineds
from
tasting
notes
dated
25
jun
2009
it
has
a
very
strong
flavor
of
cinammon
but
that
is
way
to
strong
to
make
it
good
the
taste
started
out
with
that
grainy
characteristic
i
picked
up
in
the
aroma
then
the
flavor
turned
to
lemon
orange
peel
and
coriander
sweet
wheat
flavors
in
the
finish
with
a
tangy
and
some
herbal
notes
kind
of
bland
as
well
moderate
to
high
carbonation
at
times
pretty
easy
on
the
palate
easy
to
drink
too
not
a
bad
beer
but
very
boring
i
dont
care
for
the
mouthfeel
its
heavy
and
coats
the
tongue
and
throat
not
thirstquenching
at
all
and
so
i
find
the
drinkability
to
be
on
the
low
side
i
much
prefer
mothership
wit
or
even
hoegaarden
drinkability
very
good
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
two
finger
head
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
fruits
you
cant
really
smell
much
else
the
taste
is
a
crisp
citrus
flavor
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
very
well
balanced
there
is
more
citrus
than
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
on
par
with
most
sam
adams
beers
it
is
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
very
high
you
between
the
taste
and
the
lightness
of
the
beer
you
can
drink
many
of
these
n
good
for
the
style
not
overly
citrused
or
spiced
another
samual
adams
beer
ive
enjoyed
pretty
decent
brew
poured
a
deep
gold
with
thin
white
head
nose
is
light
with
wheat
citrus
taste
is
thin
with
grass
lemon
wheat
and
other
citrus
notes
mouthfeel
is
average
at
best
pretty
thin
but
tasty
easy
drinking
and
avaerage
comparale
to
other
witbiers
out
there
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
this
seems
like
it
would
be
a
good
hangout
beer
i
also
think
this
would
be
good
with
summer
type
foods
bbq
grilling
steaks
hot
wings
etc
pearapple
juice
in
color
maybe
a
bit
lighter
with
a
solide
inch
of
white
head
that
lingered
just
long
enough
to
remember
it
laced
unevenly
down
the
glass
with
this
slight
film
left
behind
smelled
and
tasted
thoroughly
of
spice
and
citrus
a
slight
hint
of
pepper
plenty
of
bottle
yeast
that
stayed
in
the
glass
my
bad
medium
to
thick
body
that
leaves
a
solid
full
feeling
in
your
mouth
very
drinkable
and
i
look
forward
to
having
it
off
of
tap
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
is
a
little
lacking
in
terms
of
the
style
i
would
like
more
carbonation
and
crispness
as
well
as
more
yeast
character
in
the
flavor
im
good
for
a
bottle
from
time
to
time
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
more
than
one
and
definitely
not
more
than
two
being
a
spring
seasonal
brew
this
is
a
somewhat
low
body
beer
its
not
light
by
any
means
but
its
not
a
heavy
filling
beer
so
you
can
drink
several
at
a
time
relatively
easily
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
drinks
well
is
definitely
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
if
it
werent
for
the
aforementioned
dryness
i
get
id
probably
like
it
its
not
quite
as
drinkable
as
the
summer
seasonal
and
quite
possibly
not
as
tasty
oh
well
spring
is
over
i
dont
know
what
im
doing
with
this
one
still
i
like
sams
white
maybe
not
the
best
wit
i
have
ever
had
but
i
will
never
turn
it
down
i
may
prefer
it
to
sams
summer
and
would
not
mind
drinking
this
during
the
dog
days
of
summer
this
ones
a
good
beer
and
plenty
drinkable
from
old
tasting
notes
form
3
years
ago
sam
adams
white
ale
is
the
sort
of
beer
that
id
like
multiples
of
on
a
hot
day
unfortunately
one
of
this
beer
is
enough
not
bad
by
any
means
but
i
just
feel
as
though
they
could
have
done
better
prost
i
enjoy
this
a
lot
more
than
the
imperial
white
samuel
adams
white
ale
pours
a
deep
dull
yellow
short
lived
head
leaves
some
lacing
on
my
glass
smells
lightly
fruity
with
traces
of
malts
and
hops
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
best
described
as
safe
nothing
special
and
nothing
offensive
refreshing
on
a
hot
southern
day
but
not
complex
a
solid
witbier
definitely
not
up
to
par
with
the
likes
of
a
st
bernardus
wit
but
definitely
a
cheaper
alternative
with
decent
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
hues
of
orange
about
a
1
finger
white
head
that
reduces
to
film
some
random
spotty
lacing
is
left
nose
is
of
a
zesty
lemon
a
bit
flowery
not
overpowering
and
slightly
muted
tastes
sweet
and
lemony
with
a
decent
balance
of
yeast
finishes
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
the
aftertaste
has
a
grapefriut
hop
tones
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
light
bobied
decently
carbonated
its
a
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
really
stands
out
and
grabs
you
but
i
would
so
kick
these
back
while
barbqing
drinkability
it
is
fairly
refreshing
though
not
what
i
would
consider
in
the
upper
etchalon
of
the
style
so
a
pretty
good
drinker
it
isnt
one
that
i
would
turn
to
often
n
this
is
the
best
of
the
sams
seasonal
brews
in
my
personal
opinion
i
actually
this
this
is
the
most
balanced
of
all
the
sam
adams
beers
it
may
not
be
the
best
but
it
seems
to
hit
s
the
style
its
going
for
very
well
pretty
solid
atmosphere
pretty
basic
nose
but
pleasant
same
with
the
palette
pretty
simple
but
good
balance
pretty
solid
quaff
just
a
little
better
than
average
the
foam
was
white
in
color
somewhat
thick
and
not
too
lacey
the
color
was
a
hazy
gold
with
a
light
orange
highlight
the
smell
was
a
semifruity
wheat
with
a
small
hops
balance
the
taste
had
a
brazed
wheat
and
hops
balance
with
a
hint
of
fruit
mouthfeel
light
to
mediumbodied
and
smooth
drinkability
smooth
an
ok
session
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
think
there
are
several
places
to
me
that
could
be
improved
but
i
also
find
white
ales
to
not
be
my
favorite
of
which
this
actually
competed
quite
well
i
could
drink
this
and
plan
to
enjoy
the
next
one
with
a
stir
fry
its
a
dry
beer
but
its
impressive
how
long
the
scent
stays
as
opposed
to
airing
out
good
springsummer
beer
doverall
i
personally
enjoyed
this
beer
with
the
time
of
year
it
seems
fitting
i
dont
think
i
would
personally
go
out
and
buy
a
sixer
of
it
but
at
the
bar
its
a
nice
fit
nice
going
sam
adams
d
for
a
spring
ale
it
has
good
qualities
but
in
the
end
its
kind
of
just
above
average
i
think
good
and
goes
down
with
ease
but
it
doesnt
present
anything
special
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
thin
frothy
head
that
leaves
a
high
amount
of
lacing
smells
citrusy
kinda
sweet
maybe
tastes
like
more
citrus
maybe
berries
as
it
warmed
it
got
slightly
buttery
dont
know
what
thats
about
nice
enough
but
not
remarkable
md
easy
on
the
mouth
with
only
a
tang
to
offend
the
way
it
works
easy
to
drink
in
my
opinion
but
would
only
try
not
buy
its
great
to
be
able
to
drink
this
beer
out
in
arizona
it
brings
back
memories
of
spring
in
new
england
seems
to
have
a
clean
german
taste
to
it
ive
had
this
many
times
but
for
some
reason
never
got
around
to
reviewing
it
a
lot
of
malt
and
a
bit
of
spiciness
great
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
love
this
style
from
sam
adams
lot
of
good
things
going
on
here
a
fluffy
cloudy
head
floated
above
the
hazy
golden
yellow
brew
and
it
never
really
settled

beer
seems

a

too
much

not
the
type
of
beer
i
like
to
have
as
a
sipper
d
an
interesting
beer
im
glad
a
tried
it
but
its
not
a
beer
i
see
myself
buying
again
any
time
soon
decent
beer
but
if
im
reaching
for
a
witbier
i
may
go
for
an
alternative
instead
d
this
is
the
easiest
drinking
beer
ive
ever
had
the
perfect
summer
beer
even
though
its
the
spring
seasonal
open
mouth
pour
down
throat
its
as
simple
as
that
im
stopping
here
i
am
completely
let
down
with
this
i
had
true
high
hopes
for
this
beer
as
it
works
great
in
our
hot
weather
here
in
ca
and
at
6
99sixer
i
might
have
gone
back
and
bought
more
but
this
is
close
to
a
drain
pour
now
what
to
do
with
the
other
five
bottles
pours
a
hazy
orange
from
the
bottle
with
a
formidable
two
fingers
of
frothy
white
head
plenty
of
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smell
is
pleasantat
first
a
light
blend
of
orange
lemon
zest
and
clove
but
a
yeasty
aroma
soon
takes
over
i
taste
the
same
flavors
with
the
orange
and
breadiness
magnified
the
taste
and
body
are
light
just
what
i
enjoy
in
the
style
the
finish
is
leaning
toward
crisp
with
room
for
improvement
however
very
drinkable
on
a
warm
spring
day
and
one
of
my
favorites
from
sa
nice
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
a
nice
mellow
style
easy
drinking
not
too
sharp
or
sweet
like
some
whites
d
not
bad
but
there
are
so
many
choices
that
are
much
better
pretty
smooth
beer
with
a
light
orangevanillagrain
taste
decent
beer
to
drink
on
a
springsummer
day
other
than
that
there
isnt
much
that
stands
out
about
it
overall
a
well
made
white
ale
that
is
similar
in
style
to
hoegaarden
a
very
good
beer
for
the
summertime
it
has
a
lot
of
head
and
lace
both
are
and
off
white
tan
almost
a
beige
color
this
was
a
little
weird
due
to
there
not
being
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
the
body
the
head
is
a
perfect
2
5
fingers
it
has
a
cereal
grainy
flavor
the
fruitiness
reminds
be
of
like
an
off
brand
childrens
vitamin
there
is
a
light
and
smooth
mouthfeel
this
beer
is
just
a
little
above
average
for
me
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
pints
of
sam
white
on
a
warm
day
its
very
refreshing
with
some
zesty
citrus
flavors
and
pretty
thirst
quenching
overall
i
didnt
like
the
overall
appearance
of
this
beer
though
it
just
looked
dull
and
lacking
and
i
would
have
appreciated
more
citrus
flavors
instead
of
zesty
orange
peel
like
flavors
all
in
all
though
its
pretty
decent
i
say
its
worth
a
try
cheers
d
i
cant
see
anything
wrong
with
this
beer
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
strong
barley
malt
or
darkened
malt
taste
d
this
is
a
good
one
and
i
could
drink
several
especially
in
warmer
weather
i
wish
for
a
bit
more
flavor
profile
and
depth
but
its
satisfactory
and
with
good
mouthfeel
and
average
abv
its
highly
drinkable
good
beer
d
if
served
colder
than
i
had
it
it
was
out
of
the
fridge
for
about
15
minutes
it
would
be
a
bit
better
certainly
a
respectable
presentation
from
sam
adams
though
at
first
look
it
was
a
nice
cloudy
yellow
with
a
decent
head
not
much
to
tappering
off
smells
where
sweet
and
wheaty
taste
was
smooth
and
could
tell
it
was
hints
of
wheat
and
sweet
malts
not
bad
at
frist
taste
and
held
its
taste
till
end
mouth
was
not
over
powered
by
wheat
and
no
ingreant
was
overpowering
it
was
very
smooth
sam
adams
pulls
a
nice
medium
bodied
refreshing
wit
over
here
worthy
of
sessioning
due
to
price
and
quality
maybe
not
the
best
wit
but
a
decent
one
anywhere
this
is
pretty
drinkable
not
because
its
a
great
witbier
but
because
it
almost
tastes
like
a
malternative
that
said
its
not
a
bad
choice
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
i
went
to
mortons
steak
house
and
this
seemed
to
be
the
best
offering
they
had
in
a
12
oz
it
went
well
with
oysters
sam
adams
impressed
me
with
this
one
drinkability
this
is
nicely
drinkable
for
an
evening
out
or
to
accompany
a
salad
for
dinner
while
its
not
the
best
witbier
ive
tasted
i
rather
like
the
subdued
and
gentle
spices
that
do
not
overwhelm
as
happens
with
some
witbiers
d
easy
to
drink
three
or
four
go
down
easily
with
minimal
impact
again
this
is
just
about
the
sa
offering
ive
come
across
in
all
my
years
drinkability
good
quality
not
my
favorite
but
a
great
crossover
beer
from
macros
especially
if
they
like
blue
moon
mouthfeeldrinkability
very
easy
to
drink
beer
no
harsh
aftertaste
just
nothing
to
write
home
about
a
fairly
good
beginners
beer
overall
i
liked
the
beer
would
drink
again
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
it
drinkability
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
im
just
not
crazy
about
it
it
doesnt
leave
me
hurrying
for
another
sip
taste
leans
toward
the
orange
peel
side
of
the
wit
spectrum
and
does
not
show
much
coriander
or
wheat
flavors
its
an
ok
beer
but
a
subpar
witbier
easy
enough
to
drink
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
a
lot
better
than
i
was
expecting
but
still
nothing
to
exciting
with
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
flavorful
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
head
it
was
over
two
fingers
thick
at
first
the
aroma
did
not
come
out
but
after
drinking
half
the
beer
i
was
more
able
to
detect
a
hint
of
spice
that
is
common
for
this
style
the
color
was
a
dark
yellow
but
it
was
a
lot
clearer
than
i
expected
for
an
unfiltered
beer
the
carbonation
was
very
good
and
it
made
an
alley
of
bubbles
down
the
center
of
my
tongue
the
mouth
feel
was
light
and
watery
i
will
have
to
admit
at
first
the
flavor
was
weak
but
about
half
way
through
it
started
to
become
more
robust
all
in
all
i
like
that
samuel
adams
is
not
afraid
to
try
different
seasonal
styles
but
i
dont
like
how
they
have
sacrificed
boldness
to
sell
to
the
general
public
d
this
beer
is
absolutely
fantastic
any
time
of
day
when
in
season
morning
afternoon
night
and
with
any
meal
i
could
happily
put
away
several
of
these
at
a
time
i
suspect
the
spiciness
would
begin
to
bother
after
a
while
but
by
the
time
that
happens
youll
be
too
toasted
to
care
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
yellow
a
small
head
but
no
real
lacing
aroma
of
bananasclovesand
spices
very
pleasant
smell
has
a
great
crisp
mouthfeel
very
clean
with
good
cabonation
nice
flavor
of
bananas
and
spice
this
is
a
great
transistion
from
winter
to
summer
very
drinkable
can
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
one
of
my
favorite
sas
seasonals
i
havent
liked
a
lot
of
the
recent
sa
offerings
but
this
is
one
of
their
better
efforts
a
nice
beer
id
like
to
find
something
similarcomparable
that
takes
it
up
a
level
drinkability
light
and
easy
drinking
yet
overcarbonated
for
style
and
also
too
hoppy
not
undrinkable
but
nor
is
it
memorable
d
this
is
a
rock
solid
brew
and
widely
available
thanks
to
being
part
of
the
sam
adams
family
good
all
around
and
the
best
of
the
four
sams
seasonals
definitely
worth
a
try
given
how
easy
it
is
to
get
on
tap
a
brew
sa
can
be
proud
of
to
be
sure
a
decent
beer
doesnt
nearly
have
the
flavor
of
traditional
wits
decent
sessioner
d
not
the
best
wit
out
there
but
completely
solid
go
for
it
big
guy
there
are
better
wits
out
there
but
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
much
better
than
some
well
known
versions
worth
keeping
a
sixpack
in
the
fridge
i
think
this
is
actually
more
enjoyable
than
the
new
imperial
white
its
fairly
light
and
easy
and
since
it
is
their
spring
seasonal
i
suppose
thats
fitting
its
got
pretty
much
just
all
your
standard
wit
affair
definite
orange
and
coriander
noticeable
in
the
taste
and
aroma
its
also
a
bit
bready
its
got
a
lighter
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
nothing
wildly
groundbreaking
but
its
definitely
good
when
you
are
looking
for
say
something
to
session
or
to
eat
with
dinner
at
a
restaurant
it
is
pale
in
looks
compared
to
sams
boston
lager
and
cherry
wheat
and
has
a
unique
taste
it
is
a
ale
that
i
will
drink
again
a
decent
witbier
taste
although
the
grassiness
a
la
blue
oon
creeps
in
rather
than
the
crisp
freshness
of
a
hoegaarden
average
for
the
american
version
of
the
style
not
bad
but
wouldnt
choose
this
on
par
with
mainstream
white
ales
a
bit
better
on
tap
than
i
can
remember
the
bottle
tasting
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
honeyed
straw
color
with
a
weak
white
head
that
fizzles
out
pretty
quickly
wheaty
banana
pith
aroma
with
touches
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
flavor
is
pale
malty
with
some
wheat
and
the
aforementioned
spices
body
is
mediumthin
carbonation
is
high
drinkable
but
exceedingly
average
d
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
a
little
lacking
in
some
areas
that
other
wheat
beers
excel
d
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
but
outside
temp
will
determine
which
days
id
go
to
this
one
overall
a
fair
example
of
the
style
drinkability
a
very
enjoyable
beer
will
definitely
purchase
again
though
a
bit
heavy
but
very
good
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
for
a
spring
seasonal
pretty
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
good
to
have
on
a
hot
day
overall
maybe
my
expectations
were
too
high
for
this
beer
because
i
find
i
was
extremely
disappointed
i
have
tried
this
beer
twice
and
i
find
the
wheat
beer
basis
for
this
beer
is
mediocre
at
best
and
the
10
spices
are
completely
forgettable
and
musky
the
beer
does
not
adhere
to
the
witbier
style
and
lacks
the
complexities
that
come
with
more
suspended
yeast
better
malted
wheat
and
more
interesting
spices
i
found
this
beer
to
be
extremely
over
hyped
for
the
same
price
you
can
get
hoegaarden
which
is
a
superior
beer
in
every
possible
way
and
the
standard
for
the
style
i
would
also
prefer
blue
moon
to
this
beer
as
blue
moon
is
more
refreshing
has
a
cleaner
wheat
beer
base
even
if
it
contains
more
adjunct
filler
and
a
better
spice
profile
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
it
isnt
offensive
just
not
my
bag
i
had
a
lot
higher
expectations
i
honestly
would
rather
drink
a
straight
up
blue
moon
than
this
a
little
over
hyped
d
a
pretty
uninspired
offering
from
the
sa
bunch
inoffensive
but
weak
ontap
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
the
spices
can
be
overly
prominent
at
times
hindering
the
drinkability
the
carbonation
provides
a
luscious
pleasurable
creaminess
hops
are
light
and
spicy
with
a
mellow
background
of
malt
that
fails
to
keep
up
with
the
spiciness
of
the
beer
d
great
springtime
beer
the
spiciness
lends
itself
to
cool
evenings
but
its
overall
refreshing
taste
is
great
for
the
warming
spring
weather
after
reading
a
few
other
reviews
im
wondering
if
i
had
a
batch
that
had
been
sitting
around
too
long
d
great
spring
beer
very
good
it
pours
a
smooth
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
a
delicious
wit
bier
with
many
different
flavors
in
one
i
enjoy
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
in
the
spring
and
wish
it
was
around
all
year
definitely
a
beer
you
can
enjoy
from
a
bottle
or
from
a
tap
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
and
mot
brews
from
sam
adams
on
tap
this
poured
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
it
smelled
of
citrus
oranges
and
wheat
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
but
not
horrible
this
beer
would
be
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
there
is
nothing
really
complex
about
the
beer
just
a
solid
easy
drinking
beer
drink
very
refreshing
very
refreshing
brew
its
really
a
shame
its
not
year
round
overall
a
pretty
average
witbier
but
not
bad
at
all
very
smooth
drinking
beer
nice
flavor
and
good
balance
cheers
pours
a
hazy
amber
yellow
with
great
big
white
head
that
laces
to
the
glass
sweet
malty
and
citrus
aroma
some
orange
and
spring
spices
tastes
nice
and
light
with
good
wheat
taste
and
amazing
spices
i
also
get
the
taste
of
citrus
like
lemonorange
very
thin
in
the
mouth
leaves
nice
coating
and
smooth
flow
make
this
very
drinkable
overall
flavors
are
not
overwhelming
which
makes
this
witbier
quite
drinkable
definitely
a
rock
solid
sam
adams
brew
and
although
not
my
favorite
witbier
absolutely
worth
a
try
drinkability
an
acceptable
witbier
but
by
no
means
is
it
my
favorite
as
i
find
the
underlying
malts
to
be
a
bit
bland
cloudy
yellow
appearance
smells
fruity
like
citrus
and
fruity
pebbles
cereal
light
texture
and
clean
finishing
tastes
yeasty
fruity
spiced
and
like
a
belgian
white
typically
tastes
like
kind
of
thin
and
somewhat
watery
but
i
think
that
typical
for
this
style
of
beer
i
would
sum
this
beer
up
as
being
a
diet
la
fin
du
monde
thats
how
i
can
best
explain
the
character
drinkability
very
sessionable
beer
d
a
simple
beer
that
is
quite
good
and
drinkable
one
of
sam
adams
better
beers
imo
and
pretty
sessionable
a
pretty
simple
and
standard
wit
d
4
0
better
witbier
than
most
macro
examples
excellent
appearance
and
aroma
a
nice
surprise
from
the
saboston
team
this
is
another
nice
offering
from
sam
adams
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
it
in
the
summer
as
well
as
spring
i
wont
make
it
my
everyday
beer
but
it
will
have
a
regular
spot
in
my
fridge
until
it
is
gone
overall
as
a
witbier
its
slightly
off
but
as
a
spring
seasonal
it
does
fill
that
role
well
ill
probably
pick
up
a
6pack
of
this
every
spring
its
a
fairly
nice
one
to
have
occasionally
samuel
adams
white
ale
is
an
ale
that
is
refreshing
and
complements
the
spring
season
sure
worth
a
revisit
md
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
as
associated
with
most
ales
very
smoother
crisp
and
light
nice
spicy
aftertaste
as
well
fairly
good
carbonation
and
clean
finish
this
is
a
quencher
by
far
a
decent
representative
of
the
style
but
fairly
middle
of
the
road
in
comparison
with
others
i
dug
it
and
would
buy
it
again
but
i
only
got
this
because
the
tap
selection
was
limited
nothing
that
i
would
substitute
for
a
higher
quality
beer
di
could
drink
this
all
night
period
a
very
solid
witbier
that
i
plan
on
having
at
least
once
a
year
d
light
and
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavor
excellent
use
of
spices
for
a
spring
seasonal
complex
but
nothing
sticks
out
too
much
very
slight
haze
to
an
orange
body
good
carbonation
feeds
the
offwhite
head
typical
spiced
witbier
aroma
less
crisp
and
fruity
than
i
like
my
wits
to
smell
very
refreshing
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
i
think
this
would
make
a
really
good
lawnmower
beer
nice
refreshing
beer
malty
tastie
good
beginning
good
end
looks
really
good
pale
and
slightly
cloudy
orangie
good
head
and
decent
ring
left
around
the
glass
smells
fruity
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
hops
taste
like
a
standard
beer
of
this
style
with
a
long
lasting
nice
aftertaste
of
citrus
and
malt
east
to
drink
it
aint
that
bad
i
would
really
enjoy
this
on
a
warmer
day
cheers
cracked
this
one
open
in
a
weak
attempt
to
pretend
that
its
spring
in
the
middle
of
february
pours
a
cloudy
dull
yellow
colour
not
unlike
other
witbiers
whitish
head
wasnt
impressive
about
12
inch
tall
the
smell
is
mostly
wheat
and
esther
go
figure
and
slightly
citrusy
with
a
faint
yet
sharp
lemon
scent
if
you
really
take
a
deep
breath
mouth
feel
is
standard
and
pleasant
the
taste
isnt
dazzling
but
its
fine
its
a
fine
little
drink
certainly
not
a
standout
for
its
style
but
its
definently
drinkable
bottle
to
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
the
head
is
small
and
diminishing
no
lacing
is
left
behind
smells
of
clove
and
other
sweet
fruits
not
a
great
nose
faint
and
weak
the
taste
follows
the
smell
and
just
isnt
great
for
the
taste
think
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
without
the
cherry
there
is
some
banana
but
the
sweetness
gives
way
to
an
ugly
finish
the
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
im
just
not
sure
id
want
to
though
the
flavor
was
rather
weak
the
complexity
is
there
its
just
really
hard
to
get
at
i
drank
this
in
february
quickly
and
can
only
imagine
what
one
or
several
would
would
be
like
on
a
warm
summer
day
d
i
could
have
another
one
of
the
these
beers
overall
not
a
huge
fan
of
sam
adams
beers
but
i
do
enjoy
there
seasonal
line
da
great
poolside
diversion
which
is
how
it
was
consumed
perfect
for
this
and
a
perfect
warm
weather
quencher
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
d
this
tasted
awful
ill
stick
to
blue
moon
notes
this
struck
me
as
a
very
solid
wheat
beer
it
is
a
good
witbier
to
go
as
a
solid
example
of
the
style
i
remain
partial
to
hoegaarden
but
this
remains
a
solid
choice
a
drinkable
brew
however
when
it
comes
to
the
lowcost
widely
available
beers
of
this
style
ill
take
a
blue
moon
over
this
everyday
i
was
fairly
disappointed
overall
not
the
best
wit
out
there
but
tasty
and
sessionable
to
boot
d
very
drinkable
beer
in
a
very
drinkable
style
d
seeing
as
its
still
cold
out
this
one
wouldnt
work
but
i
could
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
once
it
starts
getting
warmer
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
highly
hoppedamerican
and
low
on
the
wheat
as
a
percentage
of
the
grain
bill
from
what
i
can
gather
the
apple
doesnt
fall
far
overall
too
sweet
in
taste
and
too
viscous
for
the
style
in
the
finish
feeble
and
im
being
nice
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
smooth
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
definitely
quaffable
i
could
easily
see
putting
back
a
few
of
these
on
an
evening
i
find
the
style
to
be
quite
refreshing
and
light
good
for
spring
overall
the
beer
is
solid
and
approachable
although
it
falls
a
tad
short
of
outstanding
im
sure
ill
pick
it
up
next
year
if
i
find
it
on
sale
again
drinkability
is
good
but
would
be
excellent
if
this
was
not
so
mettalic
a
good
session
beer
perhaps
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
hazy
honeygolden
with
a
decent
white
head
aroma
is
strong
and
wheaty
with
a
lemony
undertone
rich
wheaty
flavor
has
lemony
and
yeasty
tones
and
is
quite
refreshing
definitely
better
ontap
slippery
jazzy
texture
leaves
behind
a
nice
tingle
and
a
touch
of
lemon
drinkability
is
ok
its
light
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thin
bodied
for
extra
quenchiness
i
dont
really
like
this
one
so
drinkability
takes
a
hit
i
would
much
rather
grab
a
hoegaarden
the
body
is
closer
to
moderate
than
light
some
chewiness
from
the
wheat
notes
carbonation
is
light
for
style
but
still
good
overall
there
are
some
nice
malt
notes
but
in
the
end
the
limited
yeast
and
citrus
notes
are
just
lacking
to
really
excel
this
beers
rating
drinkability
not
sure
why
this
is
a
wit
doesnt
seem
like
one
to
me
more
like
a
macro
with
macro
taste
there
just
isnt
much
here
mdway
too
chewy
and
thick
for
the
style
and
if
it
were
spring
or
summer
i
couldnt
manage
the
humidity
with
one
of
these
a
miss
from
this
brewery
in
my
opinion
not
really
your
typical
witbeer
but
sa
doesnt
really
claim
it
to
be
one
as
it
says
right
on
the
bottle
that
it
is
an
american
interpretation
of
the
style
as
an
american
wheat
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
up
against
other
witbeers
it
is
not
as
good
good
beer
over
very
drinkable
not
as
watery
as
most
witbiers
d
ok
but
there
is
much
better
out
there
for
this
style
i
still
pine
for
the
days
of
the
3
cases
for
9
00
lawnmower
beer
that
ol
pfeiffer
and
fox
deluxe
went
down
pretty
well
on
a
hot
day
and
we
didnt
need
no
wheat
coriander
or
orange
peel
to
appreciate
it
12oz
brown
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
yellow
straw
colour
with
somewhat
of
a
cloudiness
to
it
their
is
a
decent
white
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
and
leaves
a
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
grassy
with
some
orange
peel
and
light
scent
of
coriander
a
light
taste
similar
to
hoegaarden
with
the
wheat
and
pale
malt
dominated
and
coriander
being
stronger
than
the
orange
peel
a
nice
beer
but
i
think
they
should
make
it
a
year
round
brew
since
this
would
be
a
nice
beer
during
the
summer
time
the
irish
red
should
be
turned
into
their
spring
seasonal
overall
its
what
i
expected
a
cloudy
light
witbier
the
fruit
smell
and
taste
are
very
appropriate
for
the
spring
season
good
job
sam
adams
a
pretty
good
stab
at
the
style
this
is
no
allagash
white
but
what
really
is
on
par
with
the
more
mainstream
white
ales
and
certainly
more
flavorful
than
hoegaarden
a
mild
buttery
goat
cheddar
is
a
perfect
pairing
with
this
one
i
had
this
one
last
year
and
i
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
they
should
still
call
this
spring
ale
like
they
used
to
because
its
definitely
not
a
witbier
at
least
not
anymore
very
drinkable
a
good
witbier
but
not
great
i
wouldnt
pass
this
brew
up
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
drinkability
pretty
good
revisit
on
this
one
at
a
colder
temp
and
had
to
upgrade
is
darn
good
cold
and
after
a
long
days
work
golden
coloring
with
1
finger
head
good
retention
not
as
cloudy
as
described
for
a
witbier
citrus
orange
scent
crisp
clean
lemon
taste
that
was
a
little
tart
at
the
back
a
little
heavy
on
the
carbonation
average
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
clean
taste
nothing
overpowering
the
drink
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
fine
carbonation
and
very
good
drinkability
no
matter
how
far
out
of
whack
the
seasonality
of
the
beer
is
bring
on
spring
sams
white
is
lacking
in
flavor
even
for
a
wit
what
flavor
it
did
have
was
very
pleasant
with
a
great
balance
of
citrus
and
spice
this
also
gave
the
beer
a
wonderful
aroma
all
be
it
subtle
where
this
beer
really
wins
out
is
in
drinkability
it
was
refreshing
and
smooth
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
its
a
great
good
choice
for
a
hot
day
mouth
feel
is
severely
damaged
by
hideous
overcarbonation
way
too
spiky
on
the
tongue
for
my
taste
also
a
bit
light
bodied
no
good
drinkability
suffers
for
this
as
well
d
pretty
high
great
spring
beer
this
one
is
not
quite
as
flavorful
as
i
expected
but
maybe
thats
what
makes
it
so
drinkable
pretty
nice
brew
the
taste
is
rather
typical
for
the
style
lightbodied
and
somewhat
tart
as
it
hits
your
palate
and
there
is
a
definite
crispness
there
you
can
taste
the
spices
as
coriander
orange
peel
vanilla
and
black
pepper
all
come
to
mind
the
finish
is
dry
but
slightly
tangy
which
makes
this
not
as
refreshing
as
some
this
is
a
pretty
good
witbier
but
i
prefer
bells
winter
white
and
even
blue
moon
to
this
one
it
tastes
pretty
standard
but
a
had
a
bit
more
sour
taste
to
it
that
i
just
cant
completely
enjoy
i
love
sam
adams
but
this
one
just
isnt
my
favorite
as
far
as
seasonals
go
i
love
the
winter
lager
from
the
sa
mix
pack
at
hannaford
market
pours
a
unusual
golden
white
color
but
still
quite
clear
smells
quite
malty
and
sweet
taste
is
quite
sweet
citrusy
but
not
overly
so
and
this
is
from
start
to
finish
mouthfeel
good
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
for
me
overall
a
good
if
not
overexciting
offering
but
i
do
like
it
and
would
buy
it
again
would
also
recommend
it
to
newbies
who
want
something
more
than
bud
or
miller
all
in
all
a
decent
beer
slight
corriander
tastesmell
nothing
else
really
stood
out
to
me
lightly
carbonated
not
much
happening
in
the
mouth
the
whole
experience
left
me
neither
happy
nor
unhappy
very
eventful
given
the
choice
for
2
id
choose
a
different
one
i
am
more
than
generous
on
points
for
a
beer
i
really
wouldnt
have
gotten
on
my
own
this
beer
poured
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
with
quickly
reducing
head
slight
smell
of
grass
and
spice
taste
lingers
a
bit
finishing
clean
with
a
bit
of
spice
all
in
all
an
enjoyable
brew
not
my
favorite
style
however
bought
as
a
part
of
the
brewmaster
selection
d
goes
down
very
easily
nothing
truly
stands
out
with
this
brew
but
that
can
be
either
good
or
bad
overall
its
an
okay
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
i
would
just
rather
have
one
of
the
other
wits
out
there
d
at
first
i
did
not
care
for
this
beer
but
then
i
had
it
on
tap
then
in
a
bottle
again
and
found
it
quite
an
enjoyable
experience
with
lots
of
flavor
and
drinkability
and
very
good
witbier
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
yellow
one
inch
head
with
good
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
spices
coriander
and
some
sweet
malt
fits
the
style
theres
a
crisp
and
smooth
mouth
feel
high
carbonation
levels
are
present
tastes
of
spices
coriander
mostly
with
a
slight
malt
flavor
noticeable
not
near
enough
other
flavors
besides
the
spice
concentration
overall
dpretty
decent
drinkability
as
its
smooth
and
tasty
and
would
likely
be
pretty
refreshing
on
a
warm
summer
day
while
not
the
best
in
its
class
this
white
ale
is
a
wonderfully
delicious
ale
that
needs
yearround
availability
at
least
summertime
it
pours
a
nice
cloudy
weisslike
appearance
that
clears
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
full
of
spicy
aromas
the
bubbly
feel
is
not
too
sharp
and
draws
out
lemonwheat
and
spices
without
becoming
a
blue
moon
the
lace
clings
as
this
smooth
creamy
but
light
not
too
light
ale
disappears
deasy
to
drink
as
this
came
out
extemely
early
i
will
more
than
likely
review
it
again
this
spring
in
warmer
weather
i
think
it
would
effect
my
review
quite
a
bit
pours
a
big
white
head
that
is
lasting
with
decent
lacing
a
cloudy
tanamber
colored
body
has
an
aroma
of
spices
coriander
and
flowers
a
nice
taste
of
some
spices
and
coriander
with
a
clean
aftertaste
nice
sweet
spicy
taste
d
a
decent
offering
overall
spicy
with
a
nice
crisp
nature
and
good
for
a
summer
picnic
beer
with
light
conversation
like
most
sam
adams
this
is
above
average
but
nothing
great
cloudy
gold
pour
with
a
slight
white
head
light
orange
peel
vanilla
and
wheat
aroma
taste
is
more
wheat
and
vanilla
with
some
spice
and
a
starchy
mouthfeel
like
a
watered
down
chimay
cinq
cent
not
my
favorite
white
but
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
drinkability
still
a
decent
wit
and
its
refreshing
enough
so
i
can
recommend
trying
this
even
though
ill
be
reaching
for
an
allagash
or
hoegaarden
the
spring
offering
from
sam
adams
the
last
seasonal
i
had
yet
to
try
i
must
say
this
one
is
kinda
boring
here
just
your
standard
runofthemill
witbier
nothing
really
stands
out
about
it
i
mean
it
fits
all
the
style
guidelines
and
is
tasty
and
drinkable
for
sure
but
i
couldnt
help
thinking
id
prefer
a
blue
moon
or
shock
top
over
this
its
a
neat
take
on
the
witbier
style
that
is
worth
a
sixer
pick
up
each
summer
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
not
a
ton
of
head
or
lace
but
some
its
a
refreshing
enough
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
sweet
wheaty
citrus
notes
with
a
zing
of
lemon
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
and
watery
not
bad
for
the
warmer
weather
d
high
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
its
very
easy
going
down
id
recommend
this
to
someone
just
starting
to
get
into
craft
beer
its
a
good
gateway
beer
d
very
good
i
definitely
will
by
this
beer
again
i
think
its
more
of
a
winter
beer
than
spring
but
thats
just
my
opinion
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
medium
head
on
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
body
smell
and
taste
were
about
the
same
typical
wibier
fruityspicy
in
fact
a
tad
too
much
in
the
mixture
also
came
across
a
bit
too
carbonated
a
good
beer
but
not
among
the
best
wits
pour
with
medium
to
very
little
head
cloudy
amber
apperence
flavor
fell
short
in
my
opinion
it
didnt
have
that
bite
that
other
better
belgian
whites
have
i
would
describe
it
as
a
belgian
white
light
if
there
is
such
a
thing
and
i
know
there
isnt
very
good
winter
beer
but
i
could
imagine
myself
drinking
this
during
the
summer
months
undenyably
drinkable
good
beer
nuff
said
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchaseyet
i
would
buy
it
again
a
decent
brew
there
is
much
more
to
offer
for
the
style
d
um
no
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
beer
is
fairly
bland
i
have
had
better
d
this
wouldnt
be
a
terrible
beer
to
session
i
could
probably
even
look
past
the
incomprehensible
bitterness
but
the
mouthfeel
is
so
damn
confused
that
id
probably
choose
something
else
i
had
to
pour
this
one
into
the
sink
and
i
didnt
even
feel
bad
doing
it
d
yes
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
d
its
a
refreshing
drink
i
find
that
it
resembles
an
american
spiced
wheat
more
than
a
witbier
that
being
said
there
are
many
other
wits
that
arent
as
bland
as
this
this
was
suprisingly
dark
with
a
cloudy
orangish
color
and
a
light
tan
head
the
nose
has
lots
of
citrus
fruit
and
some
peppery
spices
the
taste
also
has
a
big
orange
or
lemon
presence
followed
by
yeaty
herbs
a
clean
light
body
has
a
crisp
feel
nothing
spectacular
but
a
good
drinker
was
served
to
me
in
a
standard
pint
glass
slightly
hazy
yellow
in
color
no
head
smell
was
grainy
taste
was
pretty
mild
a
hint
of
a
belgian
yeast
strain
but
the
taste
was
mostly
grainy
as
well
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
thin
and
carbonation
prickly
drinkability
was
ok
but
i
have
had
much
better
witbiers
i
would
classify
this
more
of
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
i
like
a
lot
of
sam
adams
beers
but
this
one
was
only
pretty
good
d
overall
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
a
good
brew
for
hot
summer
days
however
as
i
said
its
not
as
good
as
others
of
the
style
pleasant
though
d
very
drinkable
i
have
no
problem
with
this
beer
its
ok
nothing
great
d
a
good
wit
not
great
middle
of
the
road
for
me
in
the
sam
adams
franchise
easy
enough
to
drink
a
beer
that
has
its
moments
on
tap
at
detroit
airport
at
max
and
emmas
this
brew
had
a
golden
wheat
color
with
a
14
inch
white
head
that
had
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
of
strong
wheat
and
banana
with
a
slight
hint
of
spice
the
taste
was
very
heavy
on
the
wheat
side
some
spice
and
even
a
hint
of
sweetness
could
feel
the
carbonation
more
than
i
like
this
was
an
ok
brew
but
with
my
pending
trip
to
germany
that
is
why
i
was
at
the
airport
i
expect
to
have
better
drinkability
this
would
make
a
perfectly
decent
session
beer
a
highly
drinkable
interpretation
of
the
witbier
style
fresh
and
spicy
its
a
very
cloudy
yellowgold
color
with
modest
white
fuzz
on
top
and
a
carpet
of
lace
a
mild
lemon
wheat
aroma
apple
and
a
hint
of
malt
a
mild
but
tastey
bread
based
flavor
very
smooth
with
some
fullness
in
body
while
providing
a
tangy
well
carbonated
refreshment
crisp
fruit
overtones
as
noted
in
the
aroma
even
cherry
perhaps
but
overall
the
accent
is
on
the
bready
edible
quality
quite
enjoyable
and
somewhat
unique
good
quality
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
choice
goes
down
quick
and
easy
with
decent
flavor
drinkability
after
many
years
of
drinking
sa
white
ale
its
always
one
beer
i
look
forward
to
come
springtime
all
around
good
drinking
beer
ive
had
this
on
tap
a
few
times
and
i
definitely
remember
it
having
a
better
mouthfeel
and
more
flavor
than
the
bottled
version
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
murky
golden
orange
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
wheat
citrus
corriander
and
orange
peel
the
taste
features
much
of
the
same
flavors
as
in
the
nose
with
a
lot
of
wheat
and
some
citrus
that
is
smooth
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
stab
at
the
witbier
style
it
certainly
does
not
live
up
to
some
of
the
ones
from
belgium
but
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
to
drink
i
really
enjoy
sam
adams
as
an
easily
available
good
beer
not
excellent
but
still
very
good
this
beer
is
not
their
best
effort
the
nose
is
very
good
you
can
smell
the
lemon
and
coriander
quite
prominently
and
i
even
catch
some
cinnamon
as
well
but
it
doesnt
translate
to
the
flavor
it
is
a
good
beer
after
a
long
day
at
work
but
i
dont
think
it
would
be
something
i
would
seek
out
bottom
line
it
is
an
okay
beer
but
not
a
great
example
of
a
belgian
a
mediocre
one
from
boston
beer
company
had
it
on
tap
and
was
more
impressed
there
pours
your
standard
wit
color
almost
pure
orange
with
a
fairly
nice
white
head
very
minor
lacing
nose
is
pretty
good
lots
of
orange
citrus
coriander
and
yeast
flavor
was
quite
bland
mild
spices
and
wheat
but
not
much
there
body
was
solid
although
nothing
that
could
save
the
general
unimpressiveness
overall
not
great
but
serviceable
if
you
want
a
wit
and
its
the
only
one
available
the
smell
is
spices
with
orange
peel
and
wet
hay
coriander
it
is
very
creamy
and
smooth
you
get
some
bitterness
on
the
finish
good
flavor
on
the
witbier
in
the
mouth
it
was
lightly
carbonated
i
would
buy
this
one
again
if
it
was
in
better
circulation
out
here
in
portland
a
nice
quaffable
brew
a
solid
example
of
the
style
on
par
with
hoegaarden
d
very
quaffable
great
product
not
a
notable
wit
by
any
means
but
at
least
a
quality
product
available
nationwide
i
find
that
when
im
in
a
foreign
market
and
its
spring
time
ill
fall
back
to
sa
white
when
ordering
at
the
bar
taste
and
aroma
were
simply
orange
zest
with
was
a
touch
of
clove
coriander
and
wheat
that
left
a
quite
thin
mouthfeel
wasnt
that
impressed
ill
be
grabbing
for
a
different
wit
next
time
this
to
me
was
an
ok
wit
that
could
have
had
more
flavour
the
colour
was
dark
for
the
style
and
the
nose
was
not
too
apparent
the
beer
was
certainly
drinable
but
i
expected
more
from
these
guys
as
i
love
their
lager
i
want
to
try
again
in
a
bottle
and
see
if
improves
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spices
here
but
thats
the
only
complaint
would
go
great
with
any
dessert
or
maybe
indian
or
thai
food
overall
a
nice
brew
on
an
80
degree
day
sa
white
doesnt
have
the
floral
perfumey
nose
and
taste
of
some
other
witbiers
but
thats
fine
by
me
a
beer
i
would
happily
have
on
hand
as
a
summertime
goto
refresher
overall
a
tasty
wit
pale
yellow
with
some
haziness
not
as
much
as
other
wits
though
scent
of
malts
and
some
citruslike
fruitiness
i
like
the
different
blends
of
the
spices
the
flavors
blend
together
pretty
well
wheat
malt
with
hints
of
pepper
citrus
and
fruits
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
nice
spring
brew
this
is
a
typical
witbier
nothing
to
existed
about
but
it
is
still
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
all
and
all
a
good
beer
i
have
had
it
on
tap
and
in
bottle
and
both
of
them
are
fantastic
will
buy
again
d
one
is
enough
it
is
light
and
refreshing
but
far
from
inspiring
as
a
side
note
it
is
interesting
to
see
sam
adams
start
recommending
food
pairing
on
the
bottle
overall
a
pretty
solid
white
beer
not
the
best
thing
ever
but
enjoyable
with
dinner
i
had
this
on
tap
at
bradley
airport
in
ct
after
looking
at
my
beer
i
had
to
reconfirm
they
gave
me
the
correct
one
this
didnt
look
like
a
witbier
at
all
it
was
in
fact
orange
colored
and
somewhat
clear
tranlucent
plastic
cup
made
it
hard
to
tell
the
aroma
didnt
really
say
witbier
to
me
either
mostly
i
smelled
a
lightly
spiced
ale
perhaps
the
correct
spices
but
not
the
yeasty
fruitiness
i
wanted
it
was
easy
drinking
but
not
my
favorite
interpretation
of
a
wit
and
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
the
white
ale
is
on
sale
now
as
stores
are
looking
to
unload
it
for
the
summer
brews
great
time
to
pick
up
a
sixer
or
two
theyve
made
a
believer
out
of
me
this
year
with
the
white
ale
drinkable
but
not
very
thrilling
based
on
others
reviews
this
may
be
a
different
formulation
for
draft
or
just
plain
watered
down
notes
a
nice
brew
i
havet
been
all
that
into
wits
lately
but
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
example
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
ale
though
admittedly
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
admire
this
one
the
beer
poured
with
a
lightly
cloudy
light
orange
color
the
smell
was
of
restrained
wheat
the
use
is
noble
hops
is
restrained
for
a
sam
adams
beer
and
it
balances
very
well
with
the
spices
that
the
style
demands
maybe
my
favorite
so
far
of
this
style
d
easy
drinker
right
here
im
sure
i
will
have
this
one
many
more
times
this
summer
as
this
is
offered
at
a
wide
range
of
bars
and
restaurants
good
stuff
d
not
one
of
the
best
wits
on
the
market
but
a
very
good
one
at
a
good
price
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
sam
adams
seasonals
its
missing
some
of
the
wow
factor
of
other
wits
but
still
holds
its
own
this
was
definitely
a
good
beer
but
not
great
i
was
kind
of
glad
to
be
done
with
it
it
just
wasnt
as
balanced
as
allagash
or
other
great
witbiers
ive
had
d
having
tried
alot
of
lighter
beers
and
springtime
ales
white
ales
etc
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
so
fruit
and
floral
it
would
go
good
with
breakfast
instead
of
orange
juice
and
it
probably
has
just
as
much
vitamin
c
this
is
another
better
than
average
offering
from
sa
im
getting
tired
of
trying
their
rather
longish
menu
of
different
styles
most
of
which
are
a
few
notches
above
mediocre
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
some
head
retention
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
are
just
too
subdued
youll
get
some
coriander
banana
some
spices
lemony
hints
maybe
some
other
fruits
emanating
from
the
yeasts
used
in
fermentation
the
beer
is
just
too
watery
too
safe
and
too
middle
of
the
road
to
be
of
much
interest
its
okay
it
is
fairly
representative
of
the
style
but
like
so
many
other
sa
offerings
this
is
just
an
above
average
beer
there
is
plenty
of
drinkability
here
nothing
offensive
nothing
to
challenge
the
palate
and
nothing
all
that
memorable
either
its
an
okay
beer
and
thats
all
i
can
say
another
unfiltered
wheat
beer
definitely
not
my
favorite
genre
of
beer
but
i
gave
it
a
try
this
one
had
a
strange
sweet
and
bitter
combination
with
a
lemonlime
flavor
pretty
interesting
for
a
few
sips
but
not
something
i
would
ever
want
to
drink
regularly
has
a
dark
gold
color
when
poured
has
a
fairly
long
lasting
head
had
some
lacing
but
not
a
ton
has
a
citrus
taste
and
smell
lemon
stands
out
the
most
as
well
as
some
spices
its
light
and
smooth
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
may
taste
even
better
as
it
gets
warmer
out
taste
peppery
with
a
strong
coriander
with
citrus
notes
after
a
few
pints
the
taste
changes
the
peppery
taste
gives
way
to
the
citrusy
splendor
i
look
forward
to
this
beers
release
year
after
year
drinkability
what
a
nice
segway
from
a
long
winter
to
spring
i
can
see
this
also
being
quite
refreshing
in
the
summer
ill
give
it
a
good
grade
d
i
bought
a
sixer
and
drank
it
during
a
pens
game
and
they
started
and
ended
at
the
same
time
overall
a
nice
witbier
for
a
warm
spring
day
d
this
beer
is
okay
in
my
opinion
not
on
par
with
some
of
sam
adams
other
choices
would
drink
again
if
offered
but
probably
would
not
purchase
of
my
own
accord
recommended
d
taste
is
refreshing
but
for
some
reason
it
seems
a
little
fuller
than
its
flavor
would
suggest
its
a
good
offering
but
nothing
especially
outstanding
this
is
a
really
enoyable
beer
the
winter
was
spent
enjoying
the
dark
and
heavy
beers
stouts
i
am
not
much
for
pilsners
or
light
body
beers
this
was
a
nice
shift
and
enjoyable
as
well
the
light
buttery
flavors
gave
it
more
of
taste
than
most
of
the
ales
i
am
used
to
id
drink
this
through
the
day
with
some
reds
in
the
mix
just
for
fun
drinkability
is
moderate
low
alcohol
makes
it
very
sessionable
but
lack
of
flavor
is
discouraging
drink
ability
i
wouldnt
buy
another
of
these
but
if
someone
offered
a
free
one
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
after
all
it
is
beer
d
easy
drinking
and
not
too
filling
very
drinkable
d
well
its
40
and
rainy
going
to
buy
another
6
and
hold
it
for
another
month
or
so
when
it
gets
warm
here
in
st
louis
my
guess
be
a
great
lawnmower
beer
my
style
for
summer
is
a
wit
and
this
might
be
the
ticket
overall
a
solid
choice
which
is
to
be
expected
from
sam
adams
the
spicyhop
flavor
was
a
little
overwhelming
at
first
but
it
grows
on
you
quickly
i
could
drink
a
good
bit
of
these
once
that
initial
spice
settles
down
its
weird
i
had
a
sixpack
over
the
weekend
while
i
was
in
dc
and
the
beer
tasted
spicier
more
like
a
winter
beer
each
beer
i
had
i
also
drank
out
of
the
bottle
the
one
im
drinking
right
now
which
i
poured
in
t
a
pint
glass
has
more
of
a
summer
ale
feel
and
taste
im
not
sure
if
its
what
you
drink
out
of
or
the
specific
batch
very
drinkable
i
had
this
with
a
tbone
of
all
the
meals
i
could
have
had
it
wasnt
a
textbook
pairing
but
instead
a
gorgeous
sublime
fling
very
tame
and
quite
drinkable
nice
session
beer
for
the
coming
spring
months
t
very
clean
and
crisp
very
spicy
and
delicious
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
underrated
beers
that
ppl
pan
because
its
not
as
notable
as
something
foreign
of
from
a
place
like
allagash
do
i
think
its
as
good
no
but
its
damn
close
in
an
available
package
that
is
well
distributed
it
is
a
great
way
to
try
the
field
good
times
brought
to
the
table
in
a
22
oz
glass
with
a
cloudy
orange
body
and
some
nice
specs
of
white
sudsy
head
at
the
top
aroma
is
one
of
the
best
things
about
this
one
with
a
strong
citrus
presence
plenty
of
lemon
orange
tangerine
peels
lots
of
coriander
and
passion
fruit
seeds
i
would
imagine
taste
is
just
as
sweet
and
very
balanced
mouthfeeling
is
very
creamy
and
paired
very
well
with
some
spicy
wings
d
very
drinkable
easy
drinking
middle
of
the
road
wit
drinkability
pretty
smooth
beer
could
have
a
6pack
with
no
issues
d
given
the
right
weather
this
beer
is
great
im
glad
its
a
seasonal
though
i
wouldnt
want
this
in
the
colder
months
overall
not
bad
id
have
it
again
on
tap
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
a
whole
six
poured
a
semidark
orange
color
wuth
one
finger
head
that
had
a
little
constant
carbonation
left
a
head
taht
stayed
for
awhile
and
some
good
sheath
lacing
the
smell
is
less
citric
lemon
and
orange
and
more
spices
i
saw
the
commercial
where
they
talk
about
10
different
spices
or
something
so
maybe
a
little
mind
control
on
their
part
but
i
swear
there
is
a
zesty
peppery
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
rather
dull
there
are
light
hoppy
notes
and
the
orange
and
lemon
come
out
a
little
as
do
the
spices
but
nothing
stands
out
in
particular
theres
no
spice
that
stands
out
not
a
strong
fruit
flavor
and
not
a
strong
hop
bit
lead
to
a
thinnish
almost
watery
smooth
mouthfeel
not
the
best
white
but
it
makes
for
a
damn
good
lunch
beer
d
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
but
after
the
first
it
seemed
like
the
rest
of
the
6
pack
was
doomed
my
cousin
likes
these
so
he
was
glad
to
take
them
off
my
hands
d
this
is
a
pleasant
enough
beer
and
i
will
no
doubt
drink
it
again
but
it
does
not
wow
me
though
not
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
white
ale
is
nonetheless
a
good
version
of
witbier
solid
and
delicious
recommended
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
at
a
time
but
im
not
sure
id
want
to
i
was
drinking
this
with
a
nice
plate
of
jambalaya
an
it
was
a
nice
way
to
wash
it
down
of
the
sam
adams
seasonals
this
is
my
least
favorite
not
a
huge
fan
of
samuel
adams
but
this
is
a
somewhat
decent
seasonal
offering
from
them
would
drink
it
again
if
it
was
the
only
thing
at
the
bar
other
than
a
macro
cannot
really
recommend
this
though
ive
had
this
in
the
past
but
never
straight
from
the
brewery
this
was
fantastic
big
big
surprise
always
been
a
fan
of
the
brew
but
this
was
otherworldly
d
really
easy
to
throw
back
several
of
these
in
one
night
light
and
fresh
with
subtle
flavors
and
aromas
d
very
drinkable
refreshing
and
not
very
heavy
i
really
like
this
beer
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
poured
a
copper
color
with
a
very
thin
head
the
smell
is
citrusy
with
some
spices
the
taste
is
mostly
sweet
citrus
up
front
with
some
maltiness
in
the
finish
that
makes
for
all
sweetness
the
carbonation
makes
for
a
rather
crisp
beer
thats
also
a
little
dry
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
more
than
one
of
these
at
a
time
but
i
may
pick
some
up
for
lounging
around
when
it
gets
warmer
d
i
wish
i
could
have
stayed
and
kept
drinking
this
all
night
really
incredible
chance
to
try
this
beer
exactly
how
the
brewers
want
it
i
am
going
to
start
drinking
all
my
sam
only
directly
from
the
brewery
serving
type
ontap
sam
adams
white
pours
a
hazy
slightly
cloudy
yelloworange
with
a
nice
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
plenty
of
coriander
and
a
vegetal
character
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
sweet
with
a
nice
soft
wheat
flavor
there
is
a
nice
complex
blend
of
spices
definitely
more
than
the
typical
coriander
and
orange
peel
flowery
flavor
underscores
the
sweetness
and
fruitiness
of
the
beer
this
is
a
really
good
offering
from
sam
adams
and
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
people
may
knock
sam
white
ale
as
being
weak
for
the
style
but
i
think
its
one
of
the
better
crafted
ones
it
doesnt
err
on
the
strong
side
of
maltiness
or
spiciness
but
is
palateable
with
many
foods
this
beer
was
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
at
46
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
with
a
best
before
month
notched
on
the
label
there
was
approximately
one
finger
of
white
foamy
head
which
disappeared
shortly
the
beer
was
pale
golden
and
hazy
fresh
citrus
greeted
the
nose
to
begin
with
later
on
i
think
i
detected
some
hops
along
with
spices
the
beer
tasted
of
orange
coriander
spices
and
yeast
the
taste
was
not
sharp
but
seemed
to
be
smooth
and
congenial
this
was
not
overly
spicy
but
accommodated
those
tastes
this
beer
invited
more
sipping
as
the
tastes
did
not
linger
and
you
wanted
to
drink
again
in
order
to
enjoy
the
fruitiness
and
spices
there
was
a
small
amount
of
lacing
as
the
beer
was
consumed
i
probably
could
have
consumed
a
little
colder
but
that
could
have
deadened
the
fruitiness
and
the
other
little
nuances
that
seemed
to
be
just
below
the
surface
malt
was
not
apparent
in
aroma
or
taste
d
this
is
an
okay
witbier
and
it
makes
a
fine
session
beer
easy
drinking
another
sure
why
not
light
bodied
and
very
pleasant
to
drink
i
think
you
could
turn
a
lot
of
bmc
drinkers
onto
this
one
ala
blue
moon
good
solid
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
dvery
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
wish
it
was
available
a
little
longer
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
away
appearance
was
almost
copper
in
color
a
bit
dark
for
a
wit
and
cloudy
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
left
nice
lacing
smell
the
spices
seemed
to
dominate
coriander
orange
peal
and
so
on
with
nice
sweet
malt
to
balance
taste
sweet
malts
citrus
and
spices
no
bitterness
this
beer
achieves
balance
with
the
spices
used
in
it
mouthfeel
mediem
to
lite
body
high
carbonation
pours
rather
dark
for
a
belgian
witbier
a
light
copper
color
with
surprising
clarity
and
just
a
collar
of
foam
for
a
head
the
aroma
is
more
sweet
than
spicy
with
coriander
flowers
and
um
vanilla
kind
of
weird
for
a
wit
the
lack
of
citrus
elements
is
kind
of
a
downer
for
me
as
the
aroma
isnt
all
that
bracing
or
refreshing
for
this
wit
on
the
palate
substantial
malt
flavors
balanced
with
more
citrus
elements
than
the
aroma
possesses
very
smooth
malt
flavors
and
subtle
spicing
but
little
in
the
way
of
acidity
or
refreshment
overall
this
is
a
fairly
tasty
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
the
zest
or
refreshment
i
want
from
a
wit
recommended
poured
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
however
after
a
while
the
head
completely
vanished
and
no
lacing
was
left
smell
was
a
bit
faint
but
i
was
able
to
detect
some
spiciness
and
wheat
taste
was
much
more
potent
and
quite
tasty
very
wheaty
with
a
lot
of
zesty
citrus
fruit
lemons
and
oranges
were
there
but
it
was
much
sweeter
than
im
used
to
from
them
perhaps
there
was
another
fruit
that
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
medium
body
with
gentle
carbonation
another
solid
offering
pours
a
hazy
orange
and
straw
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
some
good
lacing
the
smell
is
sweet
with
light
floral
hops
and
coriander
the
flavor
is
of
wheat
and
light
malts
with
some
belgian
spice
this
is
a
very
good
drinkable
wit
i
would
much
rather
it
was
releast
according
to
season
a
bit
more
its
10
and
snowing
and
this
has
been
out
for
weeks
but
over
all
an
impressive
season
offering
from
sam
adams
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
wit
that
i
would
not
mind
reaching
for
again
mouthfeeldrinkability
crackly
but
not
too
sharp
smooth
enough
to
deliver
a
good
swallow
its
the
most
uneventful
aspect
of
this
tasting
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
years
delicious
offering
in
lieu
of
allagashs
worldclass
brew
if
its
not
readily
available
not
much
after
taste
very
drinkable
overall
not
a
bad
brew
from
sa
their
seasonals
seem
to
all
be
very
solid
beers
nothing
spectactular
but
a
beer
you
can
drink
when
out
at
chain
restaurants
and
still
enjoy
finish
is
pleasant
wheat
and
herbal
lemon
prevail
again
the
white
ale
is
no
exception
it
is
certainly
not
from
belgium
but
it
is
fairer
still
than
many
other
americans
in
its
class
a
notunpleasant
corianderandwheat
presence
dominates
throughout
reminding
me
somewhat
of
breakfast
cereal
not
as
polished
or
subtle
as
a
european
farmhouse
brewery
might
create
but
id
gladly
drink
this
one
again
especially
when
its
ontap
in
a
smalltown
bar
as
far
as
a
white
ale
goes
its
not
my
cup
of
tea
i
would
even
consider
it
a
poor
mans
blue
moon
and
blue
moon
aint
exactly
the
best
around
too
bad
that
it
is
only
available
in
late
winter
samuel
adams
has
done
right
by
this
tasty
little
ale
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
the
blue
moon
varieties
and
other
wheat
ales
so
i
decided
to
give
sa
a
try
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
not
only
the
extreme
drinkability
of
this
brew
but
also
the
very
good
balance
which
exists
between
its
components
i
rarely
find
a
beer
that
i
feel
has
a
good
balance
of
smell
taste
mouth
after
feel
and
light
spritzer
flavors
these
initial
tastes
are
followed
finally
by
a
slightly
deeper
and
more
syrupy
malt
taste
and
feel
but
not
much
else
the
taste
was
barely
decent
its
really
not
complex
enough
to
make
me
want
to
have
several
if
anything
else
is
available
would
be
great
with
spicy
food
or
pizza

this

was

so
i
dont

when
this
is
a

by
being

its
not

it

is

and
a
thick

head

a

aroma
that
is
enticing
my
first
impressions
was
it
started
light
and
refreshing
with
a
lemony
citrus
flavor
and
finished
a
bit
fuller
on
the
back
of
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
sour
that
ended
in
a
bit
of
breadiness
the
more
i
drank
this
the
less
i
liked
it
it
became
more
of
a
bland
sourlike
bitter
with
each
taste
i
didnt
finish
the
moderately
pricey
22
ozer
allagash
anyone
poured
a
nice
amber
with
nice
head
and
decent
lacing
smelled
of
wheat
spice
and
orange
and
tasted
very
much
the
same
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
but
didnt
help
to
add
character
to
this
brew
which
it
was
very
much
lacking
one
20
oz
glass
of
this
was
plenty
i
was
really
disappointed
with
this
one
because
i
had
heard
good
things
about
it
before
trying
it
poured
a
surprisingly
dark
amber
for
a
witbier
aroma
was
upfront
with
coriander
and
orange
same
for
the
flavor
profile
a
bit
heavyhanded
with
the
spices
and
not
much
yeast
flavors
to
balance
a
little
bit
thinner
and
acidic
than
most
of
the
style
sweet
and
simpleminded
this
strikes
me
as
sammys
entry
into
the
coors
blue
moon
category
going
for
the
only
mildly
adventurous
beer
drinkers
i
had
this
with
some
friends
the
other
evening
while
out
to
dinner
it
came
in
a
large
pilsner
glass
27
oz
the
beer
was
a
cloudy
goldenyellow
atop
was
a
12
head
of
light
white
fluff
the
nose
was
immeadiately
detectable
as
citrus
lemon
orange
the
first
taste
was
suprisingly
sweet
ugg
it
almost
tasted
artificially
sweetened
average
motuhfeel
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
too
heavy
for
white
ale
but
maybe
more
aking
to
big
hefe
spice
flavors
were
stock
clove
and
corriander
maybe
cinammon
or
nutmeg
too
this
beer
really
got
worse
as
i
continued
drinking
it
it
had
a
very
ppor
aftertaste
about
halfway
through
i
really
was
very
let
down
by
this
i
dont
think
ill
ever
have
another
mayeb
out
of
a
bottle
for
comparisons
sake
so
many
better
wits
and
hefes
nice
cloudy
appearance
with
a
decent
head
and
very
nice
lacing
aroma
was
heavy
on
the
wheaty
side
but
not
unpleasant
taste
was
very
nice
with
a
slightly
bitter
lemony
quality
mouthfeel
was
decent
and
drinkability
was
not
bad
i
feel
this
would
be
a
good
offering
for
the
summer
season
overall
a
decent
brew
the
beer
as
it
disengages
the
12
ounce
brown
bottle
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
the
head
is
a
frothy
bright
white
cap
to
crown
the
body
with
the
lace
a
satiny
sheet
to
obscure
the
glass
sweet
malt
dominates
the
nose
fresh
crisp
and
clean
as
a
beer
can
be
start
is
sweet
pleasant
malt
profile
with
the
top
middling
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
persnickety
in
its
acidity
the
hops
pleasing
to
the
palate
aftertaste
is
desert
bone
dry
and
a
fine
drinking
beer
that
satisfies
my
b
spot
pours
with
a
nice
cloudy
amber
colour
and
a
decent
sized
white
head
much
better
apperance
than
expected
the
smell
is
of
wheat
spice
citrus
and
hop
this
one
is
quite
dry
throughout
flavour
starts
with
a
bit
of
spice
then
a
lemon
hop
flavour
followed
by
a
sweet
grain
finish
this
one
was
pretty
basic
but
pretty
smooth
and
tasty
overall
i
was
quite
surprised
as
the
last
time
i
had
this
one
was
probably
45
years
ago
and
it
used
to
be
much
sweeter
in
a
bad
way
the
balace
of
flavour
here
is
nice
and
this
essentially
now
seems
like
a
combo
of
the
spring
ale
and
the
summer
ale
that
the
bbc
offers
not
bad
taste
is
a
bit
biting
up
front
fizzy
and
crisp
some
bitterness
from
orange
peel
very
light
hints
of
coriander
and
clove
light
fruity
citrus
flavors
intertwined
with
lightly
sweet
wheat
malt
medium
bodied
with
a
lightly
sweet
aftertaste
a
bit
too
fizzy
a
decent
attempt
at
a
belgian
wit
but
i
like
my
wit
a
bit
smoother
not
bad
but
falls
a
bit
short
poored
nice
and
hazy
with
a
nice
white
head
went
down
relatively
quickly
to
a
nice
lace
the
taste
is
solid
but
nothing
astounding
i
havent
had
too
too
many
for
the
style
so
keep
that
in
mind
it
had
citrus
overtones
but
nothing
overwhelming
the
taste
is
light
as
it
should
be
unfortunately
the
beer
seemed
a
tad
too
heavy
reducing
its
overall
drinkability
a
nice
light
summer
time
beer
will
be
good
on
hot
days
but
better
wits
are
available
grabbed
this
one
while
on
a
regular
shopping
trip
not
a
planned
beer
expedition
so
i
wasnt
expecting
too
much
poured
a
nice
hazy
pale
yellow
with
orange
tint
and
a
fluffy
while
head
that
settled
quickly
and
left
little
lacing
the
smell
was
of
bread
bananna
a
little
clove
the
taste
was
pretty
light
but
very
pleasant
probably
not
a
superb
rendition
of
the
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
it
had
just
enough
tang
and
zest
along
with
the
breadiness
and
banannaclove
spiciness
to
make
a
warming
saturday
afternoon
very
enjoyable
this
was
also
extremely
drinkable
im
new
to
the
style
and
have
not
tasted
the
quintessential
wits
and
hefes
yet
but
this
hit
the
spot
and
i
will
be
buying
this
again
throughout
the
summer
months
good
to
enjoy
a
sam
adams
brew
again
its
been
a
while
a
great
tasting
beer
i
was
supprised
how
much
i
enjoyed
it
flavor
is
just
great
and
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
much
more
onpoint
than
their
odd
summer
ale
in
my
opinion
this
should
carry
right
through
until
its
replaced
by
the
coldermonth
offerings
it
is
ok
drinkable
the
winter
lager
is
better
crisp
bubbly
action
makes
this
suitable
for
warmer
climes
very
smooth
flowing
across
the
palate
these
bottles
disappear
very
easily
from
my
stock
i
was
initially
disappointed
that
this
was
only
available
in
12pack
form
at
krogers
seeings
as
how
im
on
a
beerbuying
moratorium
of
sorts
hmmph
glad
i
broke
it
very
pleasant
beer
from
start
to
finish
note
put
simply
a
hoppedspiced
hefe
had
this
at
the
venus
lounge
in
mankato
poured
it
out
in
the
glass
and
it
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
lemon
and
malt
scents
flavor
is
spicy
then
bitter
clean
aftertaste
served
with
a
lemon
i
dont
know
if
that
was
a
good
idea
still
not
a
bad
beer
of
an
undermade
style
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
this
become
the
new
version
of
the
spring
seasonal
this
could
stay
and
be
the
summer
seasonal
too
the
hop
is
stronger
than
id
expect
in
the
taste
but
the
beer
has
a
nice
wheatmalt
flavor
strong
citrus
flavors
the
beers
body
features
a
low
carbonation
that
brings
out
a
certain
degree
of
chaulkiness
thick
and
malty
overall
a
predictable
but
tasty
wheat
ale
sweet
wow
so
sweet
it
is
the
first
and
last
impression
that
this
beer
leaves
my
wife
would
like
it
but
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
another
without
some
insulin
it
had
no
smell
of
note
and
poured
a
nice
cloudy
light
caramel
color
had
a
very
nice
white
head
which
lingered
at
18
for
the
entire
glass
with
good
lacing
nicely
carbonated
but
sweet
i
followed
this
with
a
blue
moon
belgian
white
which
is
a
vastly
superior
beer
of
this
style
this
is
a
little
strange
for
me
and
thats
saying
a
lot
it
had
a
very
citrusy
taste
with
some
other
off
tastes
im
not
too
sure
what
the
off
tastes
were
but
it
was
funky
sure
it
wasnt
a
bad
beer
or
anything
just
a
little
sloppy
i
think
i
do
think
that
it
would
go
better
with
a
slice
of
orange
though
at
the
same
time
though
i
like
beers
that
are
good
wo
added
things
not
very
complicated
but
it
fits
the
style
goodsized
white
head
on
a
slightly
cloudy
orangygold
hued
brew
citrus
aroma
and
a
wheaty
citrusy
taste
both
parts
of
which
are
in
seemingly
equal
proportions
making
a
nicely
balanced
flavor
an
enjoyable
product
from
boston
beer
pours
out
hazy
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
spices
and
bread
tastes
wonderful
nice
and
refreshingly
sweet
very
spicy
as
well
kinda
like
an
ofest
with
some
ginger
cinnamon
and
nutmeg
thrown
in
nice
crisp
finish
with
an
overall
light
body
a
wonderful
spring
beer
which
i
would
really
enjoy
on
a
march
or
april
afternoon
poured
a
very
hazy
orange
color
with
a
medium
white
head
looks
beautiful
so
far
aroma
is
a
citrusy
spiced
and
yeasty
carbonation
is
light
but
still
present
the
flavor
is
really
impressive
spicy
all
round
with
a
pleasant
citrus
bite
and
a
soft
buttery
yeast
flavor
the
aftertaste
is
full
of
the
same
spice
very
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
new
seasonal
for
sam
adams
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
it
in
warmer
weather
huge
head
greats
me
very
nicely
and
abundantly
its
frothy
and
has
some
staying
power
the
beer
itself
is
a
heavily
clouded
burnt
orange
a
nicely
citrus
filled
aroma
is
a
treat
mostly
lemon
and
orange
peel
zingy
carbonation
makes
it
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
similar
to
the
aroma
lemony
and
orangey
peel
character
its
very
refreshing
and
reminds
me
of
summer
instead
of
spring
i
cant
complain
about
that
though
this
should
make
this
a
summer
ale
so
it
can
dominate
over
blue
moon
10
99
for
a
12
pack
oelergud
pours
a
cloudy
gold
to
orange
with
a
finger
of
head
and
some
lace
there
is
an
orangey
aroma
with
clove
and
a
tinge
of
floral
hops
that
reemerge
in
the
finish
the
malts
and
spices
are
fairly
well
balanced
leaving
a
pleasant
aftertaste
citric
tartness
and
clove
when
poured
the
white
ale
has
a
orangeyellowish
color
and
is
very
cloudy
the
smell
is
extremely
strong
with
lemon
and
orange
scents
very
present
when
tasted
the
lemon
dominates
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
similar
to
the
sam
adams
summer
ale
but
a
bit
heavier
leaves
a
sweet
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
during
the
summer
as
opposed
to
the
winter
highly
drinkable
would
love
to
have
it
all
summer
i
would
have
these
if
its
whats
being
offered
and
in
the
summer
after
cutting
the
lawn
if
the
lemon
was
not
so
overbearing
it
would
be
excellent
ill
try
it
again
when
the
weather
is
warm
all
in
all
not
a
way
to
start
a
newbie
onto
wit
beers
not
interesting
enough
to
drink
often
lots
of
spicy
smells
coriander
and
others
but
seemed
a
bit
contrived
taste
was
orangish
with
hints
of
other
spices
cinnamon
traces
here
and
there
medium
shot
ot
metallic
tastes
some
coriander
and
other
tastes
but
the
flavors
seemed
a
bit
forced
or
artificial
i
think
the
metallic
taste
might
be
the
artificial
part
to
it
medium
bodied
still
refreshing
and
tasty
but
something
a
bit
odd
about
it
not
nearly
as
balanced
and
powerfully
refreshing
as
an
allagash
white
deep
golden
and
cloudy
appearance
thin
white
head
aroma
is
delicate
but
nice
the
sweet
orange
curacao
is
evident
with
some
lemony
notes
as
well
the
taste
is
thin
though
its
lemony
and
refreshing
to
an
extent
and
there
is
even
a
lemon
like
tartness
present
but
overall
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
the
good
wits
out
there
the
carbonation
is
light
and
the
body
is
about
medium
this
review
hails
from
the
west
coast
so
we
dont
get
the
full
range
that
the
boston
beer
co
has
to
offer
so
you
might
be
able
to
imagine
how
excited
i
was
to
find
a
beer
produced
by
this
brewery
that
i
had
only
read
about
here
is
my
review
which
was
sidelined
by
my
subjective
enthusiam
so
i
beseech
the
reader
to
add
an
impartial
objectivity
boldly
stated
this
was
something
of
a
disappointment
the
appearence
is
an
orange
cloudy
substance
that
retains
quite
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
foam
that
is
balanced
by
a
mediocre
bouquet
that
can
be
compared
to
sniffing
a
chimay
grande
reserve
through
a
coffee
filter
its
taste
is
nothing
to
gawk
at
but
it
is
noticable
that
its
true
potnetial
has
been
undercut
by
commercial
imperatives
the
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
is
rounded
out
nicely
by
the
sharp
interruption
of
its
dryness
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
specimen
that
either
suit
the
likes
of
the
belgian
white
ale
amatuer
or
that
of
the
aficionado
that
never
cared
much
for
the
style
whatsoever
all
in
all
not
an
offensive
experience
nor
one
for
the
books
pours
a
cloudy
orange

a
substantial
thick
sticky
head
a
nice
looking

beer
smell
is
faint

this
is

better
than
a
blue
moon
i
also
like
this
offering
much
better
than
the

definitely
worth
having
again

from
the
bottle
with
a
stealthy
white
head
settling
over
predictably
hazycloudy
gold
liquid
offputting
metallic
aroma
in
the
nose
with
witbier
spice
behind
that
the
taste
is
lightly
tart
prickly
carbonated
mouthfeel
then
light
spiciness
and
bitter
hoppiness
finishes
on
the
dry
side
nicely
made
but
they
should
tone
down
the
hoppiness
here
so
it
would
be
more
true
to
the
style
and
maybe
kick
up
the
spiciness
anyway
i
digress
the
brew
was
a
deep
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
and
had
very
nice
lacing
the
aroma
had
a
lot
of
little
things
little
hop
citrus
mostly
lemon
maybe
orange
and
spice
the
taste
was
pretty
good
had
a
wheat
flavor
with
lemon
orange
and
grapefruit
and
finished
with
a
little
spice
over
all
i
felt
that
the
beer
was
pretty
good
more
of
a
warmer
weather
brew
that
one
that
i
would
normally
have
on
these
cold
north
east
nights
feel
that
it
lacks
in
some
areas
but
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
good
beer
not
great
but
its
ok
i
had
it
from
the
variety
pack
of
last
summer
an
ok
beer
but
nothing
to
brag
about
easy
to
go
down
not
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
sa
very
light
color
but
if
you
have
the
summer
ale
why
have
this
one
just
my
opinion
one
or
two
is
enough
for
me
overall
a
refreshing
alternative
to
the
typical
macro
stuff
pours
a
hazy
yellow
colour
with
a
moderate
head
the
smell
was
fruity
peppery
and
slightly
hoppy
the
taste
was
also
fruity
lemons
gave
it
a
sharp
sour
kick
followed
by
a
peppery
bite
and
then
it
was
finished
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
the
fruity
taste
was
too
much
for
me
and
the
carbonation
was
too
much
other
than
that
not
bad
cloudy
peach
orange
hue
thin
carbonated
head
on
the
nose
some
lemon
and
yeasty
notes
typical
of
the
style
up
front
a
crisp
rather
sharp
feel
some
lemon
peel
and
coriander
noted
backed
by
a
wheat
based
body
maintains
some
spicy
notes
a
tinge
on
the
peppery
side
bordering
on
being
medium
bodied
some
late
hop
detection
backed
up
with
some
bready
flavorings
tarty
and
a
bit
sour
palate
finishes
the
same
as
it
starts
a
fine
change
of
pace
from
the

this
is
their
new
spring

and
man
do
i
like
this
beer
a
belgian

pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
huge
rocky
pure
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
lemony
nice
and
sweet
leaves
thick
lacing
down
the
side
the
taste
is
light
lemony
and
very
refreshing
this
really
is
a
terrific
tasting
beer
nice
bready
malts
and
a
rolling
taste
of
hops
lie
nicely
on
top
of
a
sweet
citrus
flavor
base
cripes
this
beer
is
tasty
very
nice
and
a
huge
step
up
from
last
years
spring
ale
which
i
liked
seems
like
jimbo
is
getting
back
to
brewing
pours
cloudy
and
orangy
light
brown
w
a
large
head
that
dimishes
to
a
rocky
foam
leaving
lace
flavor
does
have
some
spiceness
cloves
and
pepper
etc
but
flavors
seem
abit
subdued
compared
to
the
classics
of
the
style
seems
it
needs
a
bit
of
a
more
belgian
style
yeast
flavor
to
push
the
envelope
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
on
nonbeer
lover
friends
a
belgian
with
training
wheels
the
beer
pours
a
very
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
lace
head
the
aroma
is
good
although
it
seems
a
bit
malty
for
a
wheat
beer
there
is
a
nice
mix
of
wheat
and
pale
malt
scents
here
the
taste
is
above
average
it
is
a
little
watery
and
not
very
wheat
tasting
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
spice
here
but
not
much
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
the
beer
drinks
well
but
just
like
all
their
seasonal
or
replica
beers
it
falls
short
of
the
original
these
guys
could
be
the
best
in
america
but
they
always
sell
out
to
try
and
please
the
masses
instead
of
the
ba
all
in
all
not
bad
a
solid
though
not
spectacular
offering
from
sam
adams
it
pours
a
light
oragneish
cloudy
color
with
a
respectable
amount
of
laceing
the
taste
is
certainly
consistent
with
what
you
would
expect
from
a
belgian
white
but
it
does
seem
watered
down
to
satisfy
the
general
american
public
all
in
all
a
good
beer
and
perhaps
one
of
the
better
american
take
offs
but
if
you
have
a
few
extra
bucks
to
spend
there
are
certainly
better
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
this
in
the
deli
where
i
get
my
beer
so
i
picked
it
uppours
a
deep
hazy
orane
wich
is
odd
for
a
white
with
medium
head
that
left
pretty
quickly
the
aroma
was
of
malted
wheat
more
than
anything
with
some
lighter
spicey
notes
now
the
taste
was
decent
but
seemed
a
little
heavy
for
the
style
mainly
some
spicines
with
a
malted
wheaty
flavor
in
the
finishnot
a
typical
white
to
sit
back
drink
a
few
on
a
hot
day
but
not
all
that
horrible

no

can

not
a

just
so
many
other
better
tasting
more

witbiers
in
the
world
why
go
for
a
knockoff
like
this
one
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
one
of
these
down
but
this
beer
doesnt
register
much
on
the
excitement
scale
it
wasnt
very
yeasty
as
the
cloudiness
was
barely
there
and
the
yeast
sediment
was
close
to
nothing
a
good
summer
drink
and
id
probably
choose
it
over
the
summer

that

as
well
as
the

leans
toward

in
a
somewhat

way
slighlty
watery
with
a

impression
late
weakening
the

and
the
zen
of
the
swallow
not
a
favorite
in
a
style
that
can
be
make
or
break
in
my
book
this
would
be
an
okay
beer
to
choke
down
one
of
if
you
are
into
unique
beers
but
rarely
have
i
found
a
beer
that
i
disagreed
with
so
much
that
i
had
regret
opening
it
i
will
never
purchase
this
beer
again

to

once

with

except
for

they
fail

at

they
didnt

end
of

its
half
deecent
a

that
is
a

but
the
flavor
annoys
me
a
bit
it
has
a
lot
of
orange
at
the
start
and
it
then
turns
grainy
it
is
not
a
bad
brew
but
i
get
a
bit
bored
of
the
flavor
after
one
or
two

than
that
it
is

for

a
very
solid
white

with
some
seasoning
as
expected
of
a
christmas
beer

the
smell
is

bold
with
a
lot
of
allspice
and
nutmeg
coming
through
with
some
of
natural
minty
scents
from
the
wheat
heavy
style
the
taste
was
a
bit
more
subdued
though
with
the
spices
being
on
the
finish
and
not
much
in
the
overall
body
not
bad
but
not
for
me
o
one
note
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
but
it
really
isnt
the
fault
of
the
beer
or
sam
adams
as
im
not
a
fan
of
witbiers
actually
sam
adams
did
a
good
job
with
this
beer
as
it
captures
all
that
a
belgian
witbier
should
have
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
very
good
not
too
spicy
not
too
heavy
loved
it
whish
i
would
have
tried
it
sooner
seams
to
be
out
of
season
now
next
year
it
will
be
the
beer
i
drink
on
christmas
yes
simply
because
of
the
name
this
beer
is
spiced
damn
too
much
christmas
spice
for
a
delicate
beer
style
its
okay
in
a
variety
pack
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
on
its
own
i
was
able
to
score
a
six
pack
of
this
beer
at
a
very
good
price
this
past
weekend
it
has
a
darker
shade
of
yellow
with
some
hints
of
orange
coriander
and
a
slightly
malty
aftertaste
at
the
end
a
very
solid
tasting
beer
from
sam
adams
and
one
i
can
see
myself
trying
again
someday
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
enjoyed
it
along
side
ken
burns
doc
on
prohibition
i
really
loved
the
taste
and
feel
it
is
a
very
nicely
crafted
beer
one
of
my
favorites
sadly
i
cant
get

the
flavor
is
maltier
than
i
expected
and
the
citrus
is
dialed
in
more
than
the
aroma
would
lead
one
to
believe
pretty
well
balanced
as
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
but
it
comes
together
in
a
way
where
little
comes
to
the

the
thin
mouthfeel
and
light
carbonation
are
bolstered
marginally
by
the
faint

nutmeg

on

positive
side
this
is
a
pretty
noncontroversial
beer
one
could
easily
mistake
this
for
a
somewhat
generic
american
lager
with
a
little

spice
added
i
would
have
liked
to
see

go
a

this

upon

you

the
beer
tastes
just

if

it

it

this

however
those

this
is
the
best
thing
to
drink
at

honestly
thought
the
flavor
was
the

about
this

and
it
was

sam

does
a

job
of
not
overdoing
this
with
their
wits
and
an
odd
metallic
sweetness
fizzy
with
a
curiously
empty
body
and
a
saccharine
metallic
finish
sam
adams
brews
a
number
of
witbier
variations
and
this
is
not
one
of
the
stronger
takes
great
aroma
and
an
ok
showcase
for
the
citrus
and
spice
flavors
but
lacking
in
body
and
malt
backbone
overall
so
far
this
brew
is
ok
it
is
smooth
with
some
citrus
to
the
taste
has
a
nice
balance
to
it
good
refreshing

12

poor
is

opaque
golden

color
obviously
unfiltered
smell
is
very
rich
of
spices
citrus
slight
coriander
the
order
is
someone
intoxicating
but
i
believe
it
is
a
false
pretense
to
the
actual
flavor
of
the
beer
flavor
is
of
sweetness
and
bitterness
at
roughly
the
same
time
definite
taste
of
coriander
right
at
the
beginning
it
fades
away
into
a
gravelly
carbonated
finish
not
feel
as
i
said
it
was
very
carbonated
and
it
goes
down
slightly
gravelly
all
in
all
it
is
an
average

o
refreshing

drink
light

but
flavourful
just
as
the
label
says
spices
and

with
an
excellent
aftertaste
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
how
long
do
these
comments
have
to
be
before
the
bros
at
beer
advocate
will
accept
it
im
not
the
best
taste
analyzer
so
have
mercy
on
me
ba
decent
overall
a
pretty
average
white
ale
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
i
feel
nothing
really
makes
it
stand
out
i
enjoyed
drinking
it
and
it
goes
well
with
food
but
it
didnt
have
a
strong
taste
of
its
own
a
pretty
standard
witbier
i
did
like
the
smell
which
smelled
a
bit
sweet
and
went
with
the
flavor
well
this
is
a
cloudy
medium

rather
bit

not

the
flavor
though
doesnt
really
taste
anything
like
a
real
wit
i
cant
find
any
coriander
to
taste
the
citrus
is
like
the
noseodd
the
yeast
character
is
a
little
fruity
but
barely
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
o
these
are
delicious
would
make
for
a
great
session
brew
cheers
o
very
poorly
done
or
i
had
an
off
product
but
i
was
well
within
the
freshness
date
not
a
whole
lot
here
tastes
like
a
dull
malt
very
much
a
newbie
sort
of
witbier
the
spice
and
fruit
treated
with
way
less
subtle
deference
than
the
stars
of
the
style
thats
not
to
say
that
this
isnt
good
it
is
its
just
that
i
get
too
much
of
that
american
hit
me
over
the
head
with
the
ampedup
versions
of
the
aspects
that
should
duly
be
left
as
they
are
thing
dare
i
say
chick
no
cross
that
ok
hipster
beer
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
goes
down
pretty
easy
there
is
a
nice
slight
crisp
feel
and
is
nice
and
smooth
going
down
o
a
refreshing
beer
i
wish
the
aroma
and
mouth
feel
matched
up
with
the
flavors
because
its
actually
pretty
tasty
overall
a
good
summer

glass
my
preferred
all
purpose
beer
tasting
glass
tasted
922013
a
good
beer
for
summer
pour
was
a
light
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
haze
in
it
the
smell
was
mostly
citrus
and
fruit
some
banana
which
i
thought
was
interesting
the
taste
is
primarily
that
of
wheat
mixed
with
hops
that
have
big
citrus
flavor
it
was
thin
but
with
the
taste
added
for
a
refreshing
summer
beer
found
in
the
summer
variety
pack
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
overall
decent
summerfall
beer
good
to
pair
with
a
pub
burger
every
now
and
then
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
a
full
case
of
overallnice
summer
beer
from
sa
again
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
there
are
better
belgian
white
ales
out
there
so
i
would
probably
not
buy
this
one
again
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
either
the
light
citrus
character
in
the
taste
gives
some
character
to
a
beer
that
otherwise
is
pretty
meh
again
its
not
bad
but
i
see
no
reason
to
buy
this
again

the

notes
and
light

i
good
refreshing
solid
brew
overall
similar
to
blue
moon
a
nice
wheat
beer
very
light
easily
drinkable
would
have
another
not
a
terrible
beer
but
way
too
similar
to
so
many
other
sam
adams
beers
of
a
similar
style
not
worth
drinking
again
lacks
complexity
o
ive
been
seeing
a
lot
of
seasonal
brews
from
sam
adams
lately
and
decided
to
give
this
one
a
try
to
me
it
is
like
a
blue
moon
with
the
orange
garnish
already
in
the
bottle
which
aint
bad
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
belgian
style
white
ale
although
could
come
across
a
little
sweet
o
i
liked
it
but
nothing
i
would
crave
again
might
pair
well
with
food
tho
have
yet
to
try
good
but
not
great
its
excellent
for
making
beer
batter
and
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
me
one
but
im
not
going
to
buying
it
again
overall
this
is
the
third
wit
ive
sampled
from
sam
adams
and
unfortunately
theyve
produced
two
of
the
least
favorite
wits
ive
ever
had
this
being
one
of
them
interestingly
enough
the
two
i
havent
cared
for
made
me
feel
that
way
by
missing
the
wit
style
on
opposite
ends
of
the
spectrum
one
was
oversaturated
and
hot
while
this
one
was
bland
and
boring
this
one
might
be
a
good
place
to
start
for
someone
who
is
wanting
to
ease
into
the
style
and
likes
lighter
crisper
lagers
and
ales
but
for
someone
wanting
genuine
witbier
taste
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
mouthfeel
i
think
this
was
the
worst
of
all
soapy
mouthfeel
and
when
it
goes
down
rough
on
the
throat
it
really
lingers
in
flavor
taste
palate
sams
white
lantern
has
a
smooth
light
palate
with
a
light
malt
base
a
hint
a
spice
and
a
touch
of
citrusy
bitterness
o
a
greatly
refreshing
crisp
witbier
the
spiciness
while
it
does
make
it
stand
out
from
every
other
orange
peel
and
coriander
wheat
beer
might
not
be
what
you
want
for
a
summer
thirst
quencher
still
i
have
to
give
them
credit
for
making
a
unique
beer
true
to
style
and
one
that
works
i
am
surprised
by
the
low
ratings
this
beer
is
quite
good
for
a
wit
with
spice
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
with
a
fair
head
that
has
low
lacing
that
dissipates
quickly
not
much
nose
but
there
is
slight
floral
sweetness
present
balance
is
outstanding
with
a
stylistic
mouthfeel
it
finishes
with
a
burst
of
spice
as
intended
with
no
hop
bitterness
aftertaste
this
a
very
good
summer
ale
quite
drinkable
the
taste
is
a
step
up
from
what
i
expected
after
the
aroma
decent
spicy
and
citrus
notes
mingle
well
with
the
biscuit
malts
and
a
smooth
slightly
lingering
finale
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
white
ale
i
probably
wont
have
too
many
more
due
to
the
season
but
ill
look
for
some
more
next
year
every
brew
has
its
place
in
the
sun
decent
fare
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
easily
it
reminds
me
a
lot
like
a
blue
moon
except
that
it
has
more
flavors
of
orange
peels

decent
take
on
a
witbier
overall
im
glad
to
see
they
used
noble
hops
in
the
recipe
i
think
citrusy
hops
would
have
been
too
much
for
the
style
a
bit
unusual
and
off
the
beaten
path
perhaps
for
certain
palates
andor
certain
types
of
days
or
occassions
this
one
is
ok
to
accompany
the
recent
heatwave
weve
just
endured
o

goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
it
seems
very

but
a
decent
beer
overall
pours
a
nice
hard
copper
color
nice
head
but
dissipates
quickly
scents
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
spices
on
the

non

quick
burst
of
tingling

goodness
on
the
initial
sip
with
that

tingling
moving
from
the
front
to
back
of
the
tongue
very
smooth
and
slightly
tart
a
bit
thin
but
true
to
the
style
smooth
and
easy
drinking
good
session
beer
especially
for
spring
and
summer
similar
to
the
original
white
ale
by
samuel
adams
better
than
i
expected
loved
the
original
white
ale
and
this
may
be
just
as
good
a
well
crafted
flavorful
stab
at
the
belgian
style
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
hazy
golden
color
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
quickly
dissapears
the
smell
is
very
aromatic
of
orange
and
coriander
the
taste
has
a
nice
orange
flavor
to
is
not
overpowering
and
the
coriander
and
other
spices
come
through
really
nice
and
subtle
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
great
well
carbonated
and
balanced
this
is
one
of
the
better
witbier
i
have
had
decide
to
review
another
one
of
the
beers
from
the
spring
seasonal
pack
from
sam
adams
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
plisner
glass
a
hazy
color
thats
reminds
me
of
pear
juice
with
a
light
head
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
citrus
and
honey
nice
flavor
of
coriander
and
citrus
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
white
lantern
is
a
hazy
peachywheat
color
with
a
thin
active
white
head
the
nose
is
sweet
and
spicey
corriander
is
definitely
noticable
which
complements
the
otherwise
orangycitrusy
backdrop
the
flavor
is
what
you
would
expect
based
on
the
taste
very
similar
to
blue
moon
but
possibly
a
bit
more
tart
and
not
quite
as
sweet
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
mouthcoating
carbonation
overall
a
good
beer
nothing
outrageous
but
definitely
a
solid
beer
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
i
drank
the
whole
6
pack
of
it
my
wife
got
me
so
i
guess
it
was
good
overall
i
like
this
beer
honestly
its
pretty
much
a
summer
ale
with
slighty
more
of
an
orangey
character
actually
and
i
hate
to
say
this
its
a
slightly
less
good
blue
moon
coors
made
a
better
product
than

there
just
seems
to

something
off
about
this

there
was

an
almost
flat

the

was

at
best
it
is
not
one
of
the
better
beers
that
i
have
had
from
bbc
run

wit
not
quite
good
enough
to
be

not
even
as
good
as
blue

skip
this
one
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
nice

and
some
decent

is
just
a

with

wheaty
with
some

rind

overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
the
rest
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
germanstyle
hefewiesen
then
anything
belgian
it
lacks
that
funkier
belgian
yeast
characteristic
regardless
its
pretty
decent
and
easy
drinking
o

and
a

choice
for

doesnt
stand
up
to
the
better

overall
fine
beer
for
what
it
is
i
personally
would
rather
grab
a
glass
of
more
authentic
witbiers
that
wouldnt
be
too
far
away
from
this
on

shelf
sam
adams
still
delivers

this

is

mix

coriander
and
grains

bitter

pit
mouthfeel
is

carbonation
a

how

could

something

yeast

heavy
on
this
one
bringing
out
a
bready
nutty
character
that
pretty
much
dampers
the
experience
for
me
it
was
like
a
spring
release
of
the
summer
ale
toned
down
a
bit
overall
this
experiment
from
sam
adams
just
misses
the
target
for
me
i
should
like
it
but
i
just
dont
and
thats
ok
though
not
unpleasant
this
is
was
very
average
i
rarely
find
myself
saying
this
about
witbiers
but
it
couldve
used
some
more
spice
to
liven
things
up
a
bit
wheat
beers
dont
seem
to
be
sam
adams
strong
point
this
is
a
great
beer
and
it
just
makes
more
of
a
statement
for
sam
adams
i
do
not
really
consider
sam
adams
craft
beer
in
anyway
but
most
of
their
products
are
cheaper
and
simply
better
tasting
than
some
of
the
other
craft
beer
on
the
market

sa
makes
more
craft

with
training

feel
is
a
bit
rich
for
the
style
and
excarbated
by
the
under
represented
carbonation
level
in
the
pour
easy
drinking
nonetheless
in
a
sense
as
the
light
carbonation
and
lack
of
stops
on
the
bus
route
of
flavor
allow
for
a
quick
trip
to
your
destination
that
being
the
bottom
of
the
glass
final
thoughts
of
the
six
different
beers
in
the
spring
sampler
pack
i
was
looking
forward
to
white
lantern
the
least
however
it
has
turned
out
to
be
better
than
some
of
the
others
if
you
like
blue
moon
then
this
one
will
probably
blow
your
mind
would
i
drink
it
again
no
o
like
i
said
good
summer
beer
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
its
pretty
well
balanced
between
flavour
and
drinkability
overall
this
is
not
an
outstanding
witbier
but
it
works
in
a
pinch
its
probably
quite
nice
on
a
hot
sunny
day
a
well
made
wit
suitable
for
a
warm
afternoon
overall
a
decent
light
wheat
ale
with
some
nice
citrus
and
coriander
notes
o
this
is
a
very
good
white
ale
that
fans
of
the
style
who
enjoy
a
lot
of
citrus
will
like
well
worth
a
try
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
orangetan
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
citrus
fruit
and
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
citrus
and
tropical
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
light
and
refreshing
o
an
ok
beer
id
drink
another
if
the
options
were
limited
eh
its
been
too
long
for
me
to
remember
is
this
any
different
than
the
old
sa
spring
wheat
spritzier
maybe
sa
sure
does
love
those
grains
of
paradise
this
is
certainly
now
my
favorite
wheat
beer
flavorful
refreshing
and
brief
a
burst
of
complexity
on
the
tongue
that
doesnt
leave
any
unpleasant
aftertaste
food
recommendations
include
quesadillas
enchiladas
or
cheesesteak
sandwiches
if
you
crave
something
heavy
but
i
find
it
perfect
just
on
its
own
cheers
there
is
a
light
citrus
and
spice
to
the
taste
the
smell
is
that
distinctive
wheat
citrus
it
is
fairly
lackluster
for
the
type
nothing
spectacular
stands
out
or
rather
nothing
is
distinctively
great
about
it
i
would
not
get
this
again
o
overall
the
spicing
and
mouthful
wasnt
as
sharp
as
i
like
or
prefer
by
style
hoegarrden
is
a
very
good
example
and
measuring
stick
of
both
the
spicing
was
soft
and
almost
homogenized
to
the
point
it
was
hard
to
distinish
individual
quality
the
sourness
factor
was
turned
down
a
bit
overall
i
usually
like
sam
adams
approach
to
drinkability
while
maintaining
a
good
level
of
flavor
and
respectability
though
by
style
this
is
a
hard
one
to
do
both
the
flavor
is
a
light
and
enjoyable
one
to
throw
back
to
just
dont
expect
a
big
wit
style
here
at
only
1
a
beer
in
the
12pack
this
one
is
worthy
enough
o
i
enjoyed
this
one
wheat
beers
arent
my
favorite
style
but
summer
is
on
the
way
and
this
one
will
be
a
nice
warm
weather
treat
o
meh
just
another
wheat
beer
nothing
special
not
horrible
its
ok
probably
wouldnt
say
no
to
another
one
although
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
either
try
it
if
you
like
lighter
beers
o
cant
really
say
i
care
for
this
maybe
id
like
it
better
if
i
were
on
a
boat
or
something
overall
a
strong
contender
in
the
flavor
category
but
not
the
aroma
category
white
lantern
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
color
the
aroma
is
an
onslaught
of
citrus
with
a
hint
of
traditional
witbier
spicing
the
citrus
from
the
nose
isnt
nearly
as
strong
on
the
tongue
providing
a
mellow
orange
with
a
low
level
of
spices
floating
over
it
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
drinkability
is
good
white
lantern
is
easydrinking
and
surely
targeted
at
the
blue
moonshock
top
crowd
ill
take
it
over
either
of
them
for
sure
the
flavor
is
decent
with
the
appropriate
level
of
spice
without
going
overboard
more
of
a
lemon
zest
flavor
and
slight
wheat
yeast
tanginess
is
the
dominant
flavor
with
very
mild
malt
and
the
carbonation
level
is
scrubbing
away
a
lot
after
the
swallow
so
a
kind
of
dry
yeast
flavor
in
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
not
my
first
choice
when
it
comes
to
the
style
i
basically
drank
it
because
luck
of
the
draw
in
a
sampler
pack
12oz
bottle
from
a
12pack
spring
sampler
pours
a
hazy
greyish
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
awhile
aroma
is
somewhat
sour
with
wheat
citrusspice
orange
zest
tangerine
tastes
are
slightly
sour
and
tart
with
soggy
wheat
tangerine
mandarin
orange
coriander
pepper
thinner
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
not
the
greatest
witbier
disappointingly
odd
to
say
the
least
o
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
belgianstyle
white
ale
and
kind
of
reminds
me
of
my
first
sam
adams
which
was
their
white
ale
not
the
best
beer
in
their
spring
thaw
but
a
good
sipper
for
the
season
white
lantern
is
alright
in
my
book
if
youre
looking
for
a
pretty
tasty
beer
thats
simple
straight
forward
and
drinkable
check
it
out
its
not
a
great
witbier
but
its
pretty
good
it
could
be
improved
with
a
stronger
nose
bolder
spices
and
a
tad
more
body
its
definitely
worth
checking
out
o
decent
witbier
that
does
what
it
was
made
to
be
light
feeling
sessionable
and
with
a
decided
spicy
finish
this
is
a
good
beer
to
watch
the
temperature
warm
to
summer
with
i
think
that
this
was
so
light
that
it
was
able
to
completely
hid
the
alcohol
as
this
didnt
feel
like
beer
at
all
im
sure
it
was
there
but
i
just
never
felt
it
and
i
could
have
had
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
had
my
taste
buds
been
watereddown
a
bit
this
beer
wasnt
so
much
a
disappointment
as
much
as
it
just
didnt
feel
like
beer
this
should
have
come
with
a
cork
on
the
bottle
or
brut
written
on
the
side
of
it
but
ill
take
it
for
what
it
is
the
first
new
offering
from
sam
adams
in
a
while
that
just
didnt
measure
up
this
is
definitely
a
belgian
wit
compared
to
some
others
this
version
from
sa
is
real
heavy
on
the
orangeespecially
the
peel
spicylots
of
coriander
plenty
of
malt
body
but
it
is
overshadowed
by
the
heavy
dose
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
carbonation
is
appropriately
mediumhigh
an
ok
witwould
prefer
it
a
little
more
naked
this
is
by
far
the
weakest
of
the
spring
thaw
pack
if
i
want
a
good
and
familiar
wit
ill
go
after
hoeegaarden
or
even
blue
moon
to
me
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
a
very
strong
foundation

both
creamy
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
a
bit
sharp
on
the
back
of
the
neck
still
a
strain
to
consider
this
in
league
with
vedett
and
hoegaarten
but
a
tasty
beer
if
you
like
something
sweet
probably
the
least
impressive
beer
in
this
years
spring
mix
weirdly
familiar
though
has
this
been
in
here
before
maybe
under
another
name
i
dont
know
anyways
it
pours
a
pale
hazy
shade
of
yellow
with
a
quickly
dying
white
head
the
nose
is
overly
coriander
and
orange
juice
with
a
lot
of
malted
white
wheat
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
a
belgian
yeast
vibe
in
the
flavor
but
it
really
isnt
there
as
this
is
closer
to
a
german
hefe
than
a
belgian
wit
in
a
number
of
ways
the
orange
element
is
also
pretty
weak
and
its
too
herbal
from
the
coriander
it
is
refreshing
but
its
also
a
little
soapy
fine
carbonation
and
a
less
than
medium
body
makes
it
pretty
drinkable
but
i
just
dont
feel
like
drinking
more
than
the
two
per
12er
that
comes
in
this
box
its
really
underwhelming
especially
after
sam
has
made
some
pretty
fun
wits
over
the
years
this
is
one
to
pawn
off
on
your
guests
o
overall
white
lantern
is
a
pretty
decent
witbier
but
probably
not
something
i
would
purchase
again
in
the
future
i
dislike
the
possibility
that
i
might
have
left
anything
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
with
such
styles
so
i
am
a
king
of
agitation
in
this
case
it
resulted
in
a
dense
fluffy
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
that
allowed
me
to
ensure
that
i
had
emptied
the
bottle
clarity
was
indeed
hazy
not
cloudy
so
i
give
them
props
for
truth
in
advertising
and
the
color
was
an
orangishyellow
nose
really
gave
off
orange
peel
and
tangerine
and
i
was
anxious
to
compare
this
to
the
previous
beer
that
i
reviewed
of
the
same
style
mouthfeel
was
big
and
full
not
overly
carbonated
but
more
creamy
in
fact
the
taste
reminded
me
of
a
dreamsicle
creamsicle
which
was
the
frozen
novelty
that
consisted
of
a
vanilla
ice
cream
center
enrobed
by
orange
sherbert
i
used
to
love
them
as
a
kid
in
the
summertime
ah
nostalgia
while
drinking
beer
there
is
nothing
better
i
finally
got
the
spiciness
on
the
finish
but
they
really
dialed
it
in
to
the
point
that
it
did
not
interfere
with
the
orange
i
have
had
wits
that
tasted
and
felt
as
though
i
had
sprinkled
black
pepper
on
my
tongue
and
it
is
not
a
pleasant
experience
neither
is
its
polar
opposite
in
which
the
brewer
cannot
pull
the
trigger
and
it
ends
a
bland
watery
mess
this
was
good
overall
not
my
favorite
but
enjoyable
enough
o
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
like
it
but
i
dont
love
it
im
not
sure
id
go
out
looking
for
a
6pack
but
if
it
was
offered
to
me
id
happily
drink
it
its
not
a
straight
forward
witbier
thats
for
sure
the
base
may
be
in
a
wit
but
the
spices
are
too
much
in
the
forefront
for
it
to
be
faithful
to
the
style
label
is
notched
by
best
june
2013
man
this
is
juicy
for
a
wit
you
know
what
it
reminds
me
of
blue
moon
the
aroma
has
a
cleaner
wholegrain
bread
note
with
a
dash
of
pepper
and
the
flavor
does
still
resemble
a
wit
but
its
closer
to
blue
moon
than
hoegaarden
or
allagash
white
theres
a
mild
tart
feel
with
floral
tangerine
flavor
with
more
smooth
doughy
bread
make
sure
you
let
this
one
warm
up
for
at
least
20
minutes
its
much
better
at
cellar
temps
the
fruit
is
still
on
the
heavy
side
along
with
the
floral
spices
but
its
an
interesting
enough
take
on
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
bigger
than
expected
without
going
too
big
for
the
style
its
got
some
substance
to
it
and
it
really
has
a
nice
rolling
rich
flow
to
it
with
plenty
of
smoothness
mingling
with
a
pleasant
crisp
bite
off
a
solid
carbonation
overall
drinkability
overall
its
just
okay
although
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
letdowns
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
wit
the
flavor
is
good
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
isnt
working
drinkability
is
not
there
either
one
is
enough
and
im
not
real
inclined
to
have
another
o
nothing
really
stands
out
about
this
beer
for
me
it
tastes
like
any
number
of
other
lighter
witbiers
that
are
available
on
the
market
in
fact
i
think
there
are
a
couple
of
other
sam
adams
ones
that
are
similar
o
this
is
a
nice
witbier
i
liked
it
better
than
some
other
american
versions
out
there
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
slowly
dissipating
white
head
there
are
lots
of
visible
tiny
bubbles
visible
in
the
beer
the
beer
smells
of
bread
orange
coriander
and
pepper
the
aromas
are
pretty
subdued
overall
the
beer
tastes
pretty
clean
theres
the
wheat
as
well
as
the
orange
which
come
through
strongest
the
coriander
and
grains
of
paradise
provide
some
background
flavor
while
the
beer
has
a
nice
clean
taste
theres
a
good
malt
backbone
here
which
helps
give
this
a
light
to
medium
body
the
carbonation
is
pretty
moderate
and
the
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
good
beer
cheers
the
white
lantern
from
sammy
ale
is
decent
and
reminds
me
alot
fo
the
white
ale
white
christmas
etc
that
they
have
had
the
beer
pours
pale
clear
yellow
with
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
has
hints
of
citrus
orange
peel
and
spice
the
taste
has
a
battle
between
the
citrus
and
spice
with
a
good
malt
base
and
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
this
is
good
but
there
are
so
many
other
great
beers
that
this
would
be
lost
in
the
crowd
this
is
a
medium
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
a
decent
drinking
wit
but
quite
yeasty
and
a
little
strangedirty
with
almost
a
melon
character
about
it
i
just
wasnt
feeling
it
with
this
brew
and
would
not
choose
to
drink
this
again
if
there
were
other
options
the
orange
and
coriander
are
rather
distinct
in
the
flavors
a
bitterish
tang
at
the
end
pleasant
and
gulpable
its
hard
to
find
much
fault
with
this
but
its
a
little
on
the
acidic
side

with
well
balanced
sweetness
and
dryness
slightly
weak
overall
impression
but
not
a
bad
beer
d
a
bit
too
sweet
and
kind
of
onedimensional
like
many
american
witbiers
there
just
isnt
much
to
recommend
this
definitely
better
than
average
for
the
style
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
straight
forward
brew
not
much
else
to
say
a
beginner
beer
for
the
style
it
hits
the
style
points
but
they
are
very
light
very
easy
to
drink
hazy
straw
white
head
that
builds
well
but
falls
quickly
no
lacing
left
behind
typical
sanitized
american
brewed
version
of
a
wit
lightly
doughy
and
crackery
with
a
whiff
of
oatmeal
aroma
bright
orange
flavor
with
a
prominent
spice
coriander
and
clove
quick
insipid
finish
pretty
standard
witbier
the
tangerine
twist
gives
a
slightly
brighter
citrus
flavor
than
many
but
otherwise
not
much
to
write
home
about
it
seems
like
sam
adams
brews
a
lot
of
spiced
wheat
beers
chalk
this
up
as
another
average
one
cloudy
light
straw
colored
appearance
great
fruity
potpourri
aroma
with
citrus
notes
floral
citrus
hoppy
taste
good
flow
over
palate
great
drinkability
would
be
great
in
the
summertime
as
weird
as
that
sounds
with
a
beer
called
white
lantern
slightly
bitter
finishes
just
slightly
drier
very
drinkable
not
the
greatest
wit
out
there
but
enjoyable
none
the
less
aroma
of
citrusy
spices
very
pleasant
on
the
nose
pours
a
hazy
medium
yellow
with
white
but
very
short
lived
head
spotty
lacing
taste
is
crisply
spicy
and
refreshing
coriander
and
sweetgrass
with
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
slightly
sour
finish
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
pale
hazy
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
and
a
sparse
filmy
coating
of
white
head
aromas
of
apricot
and
orange
rind
with
a
bready
and
slightly
buttery
undertone
very
sugary
sweet
smell
overall
flavors
of
bread
first
and
foremost
with
a
blended
marmalade
highlight
of
sweet
citrus
and
apricot
unbalanced
and
a
touch
cloying
the
body
is
thin
and
filmy
from
the
carbonation
and
there
is
a
sharp
frothy
finish
syrupy
sweet
aftertaste
this
beer
is
a
little
much
on
the
sweet
for
me
but
i
could
see
it
being
appealing
to
the
cider
population
venturing
into
the
beer
world
the
slightly
racist
member
of
the
lantern
corps
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
lightly
hazy
pale
yellowstraw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
wheat
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
and
a
vague
sense
of
citrus
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
less
pepper
and
a
tad
more
citrus
everything
still
comes
across
as
watereddown
artificially
muted
it
doesnt
wanna
be
gagged
but
what
victim
does
right
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
pretty
meek
wit
one
with
precious
little
spicing
and
a
character
so
bland
michael
bay
wants
to
replace
him
with
something
more
rounded
for
one
of
his
background
characters
i
dont
know
that
i
would
seek
this
one
out
its
basically
the
summer
ale
in
a
different
bottle
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
something
just
tasted
off
to
me
just
tasted
like
it
wasnt
balanced
quite
right
in
my
opinion
12
oz
bottle
pours
hazy
golden
with
long
lasting
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
of
lemon
zest
wheat
malt
and
spices
body
is
medium
and
crisp
a
lot
of
spices
citrus
fruit
and
wheat
malt
fill
the
mouth
finish
is
medium
and
spicy
nice
wit
i
would
buy
it
again
tasty
wit
here
its
not
groundbreaking
but
is
smooth
and
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
pretty
good
all
around
it
is
a
tad
watery
but
still
good
i
poured
this
yukkie
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
mess
with
a
thin
little
wimpy
head
the
smell
was
like
sour
soup
or
something
the
taste
was
sour
also
and
just
not
good
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
finish
it
off
fruity
flay
tasting
mess
of
a
beer
they
need
to
ditch
that
one
i
will
never
buy
or
drink
another
rjt
odthe
flavor
was
pretty
decent
it
fulfills
its
niche
in
the
variety
pack
o
im
a
bit
pleasantly
surprised
here
i
came
in
expecting
to
dislike
it
as
much
as
i
do
the
summer
ale
but
its
actually
decent
i
dont
think
id
buy
a
6
pack
of
it
should
they
be
made
available
though
overall
a
pretty
nice
version
of
a
witbier
but
nothing
to
exceptional
pours
hazy
brownish
gold
murky
with
white
foam
layer
minor
orange
peel
nose
citrus
grains
of
paradise
nose
reminiscent
of
the
sam
summer
ale
as
well
taste
is
a
light
citrus
then
wheat
finish
with
an
orange
citrus
tang
smooth
and
chalky
mouthfeel
tart
remains
on
the
tongue
nice
beer
pours
a
cloudy
medium
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
good
retention
and
a
very
nive
lacing
aroma
is
of
wheat
orange
and
spices
body
is
crisp
and
i
would
say
the
very
light
side
of
medium
taste
is
of
ale
and
spice
with
orange
lemon
zest
in
the
finish
very
nice
although
they
appear
to
be
the
same
brew
i
liked
the
white
christmas
a
bit
better
overall
not
a
very
flavorful
brew
but
what
this
witbier
lacks
in
flavor
it
makes
up
for
in
a
light
refreshing
drinkable
quality
maybe
its
because
i
got
a
light
workout
in
before
review
but
this
thing
is
really
hitting
the
spot
probably
would
have
been
better
mixed
in
with
the
sam
summer
pack
and
not
the
spring
pack
that
comes
out
before
the
snow
has
even
thawed
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
goblet
best
before
june
2013
this
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
an
okay
off
white
head
which
has
decent
retention
the
smells
are
nice
and
citrusy
full
of
orange
peels
and
spices
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
decent
you
get
a
little
bitter
orange
along
with
mild
hops
and
some
malts
easy
to
drink
i
dig
this
beer
good
price
too
id
pick
this
up
if
you
have
a
chance
overall
minus
the
gop
its
not
particularly
distinguishable
from
a
blue
moon
and
after
summer
and
coastal
wheat
im
really
not
sure
they
needed
another
light
wheatbased
grains
of
paradisedosed
anything
o
an
americanized
witbier
similar
to
their
summer
ale
but
with
a
fuller
mouthfeel
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
but
why
would
i
buy
this
over
nearly
identical
offerings
by
sa
or
other
better
witbiers
a
decent
effort
but
not
a
rebuy
o
not
great
not
bad
either
kind
of
good
i
guess
drinkable
at
least
just
unimpressive
not
the
most
yeast
influenced
witbier
by
any
means
but
not
bad
at
all
expect
a
lot
of
orange
and
lemon
peel
feel
here
o
pretty
good
witbier
but
nothing
too
special
above
average
had
this
in
a
variety
pack
at
a
super
bowl
party
feels
like
more
of
a
summer
drink
but
oh
well
pours
a
hazy
orangegold
colour
with
a
foamy
head
that
quickly
gives
way
to
thin
lacing
smells
like
fruit
and
citrus
heavy
wheat
notes
the
taste
is
just
ok
it
does
not
taste
like
a
standard
wit
its
a
little
too
heavy
on
the
citrus
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
a
tad
bit
thin
kinda
like
seltzer
was
added
its
actually
a
pleasant
drink
easy
to
drink
but
its
not
very
memorable
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
its
fine
to
discover
in
the
variety
pack
o
this
wit
is
good
for
its
own
reasons
it
wont
taste
like
many
of
the
other
wits
out
there
that
have
more
belgian
phenolic
tones
but
it
is
done
very
nicely
it
has
more
of
an
american
take
on
the
style
with
more
citrus
and
less
yeast
characteristics
i
would
have
liked
more
carbonation
and
a
bigger
head
despite
its
shortcomings
it
is
better
than
some
of
the
average
wits
ive
had
taste
is
both
spicy
and
sweet
a
different
take
on
the
usual
belgian
wit
vibe
the
citrus
and
coriander
work
well
together
in
tandem
here
and
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
poured
out
as
a
slightly
hazy
orange
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
head
was
white
had
a
thin
retention
and
not
much
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
lightly
spiced
with
a
fruity
character
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
pretty
good
there
is
a
bit
amount
of
fruit
and
sweetness
in
the
flavor
subtle
spice
and
a
wheat
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
a
nice
carbonation
overall
its
not
a
bad
witbier
reminded
me
of
sunset
wheat
personally
pours
a
deep
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
fades
smell
is
subtle
sweet
with
a
healthy
dose
of
lemon
taste
is
lemony
with
a
slight
peppery
feel
subtle
sweet
has
some
citrus
before
a
huge
lemon
kick
a
lighter
mouthfeel
slightly
crisp
overall
a
bit
too
much
lemon
but
a
decent
brew
o
too
fruity
for
me
lacks
balance
more
of
a
summer
ale
would
be
better
with
cook
out
food
to
sweet
on
its
own
atleast
it
doesnt
lack
flavor
middle
of
the
pack
from
sam
adams
at
best
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
doesnt
have
a
great
flavor
profile
either
this
comes
across
as
a
typical
americanized
witbier
big
orange
notes
some
straw
and
faint
almost
unnoticeable
spices
this
was
nice
to
try
once
but
i
certainly
wont
be
having
it
again
it
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
with
low
retention
and
lots
of
bubbles
initially
that
quickly
dissapate
it
has
a
citrus
aroma
with
a
little
belgium
yeast
scent
in
there
it
tastes
crisp
and
refreshing
and
a
little
bready
upfront
and
then
it
is
all
citrus
im
the
finish
it
has
a
slightly
above
average
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
this
would
be
a
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
bottle
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
white

nose
is

straw
bread
palate
is

stingy

lashing
with

finish
lightly
sweet
with
flavors

light
spiciness
and
bread
dry
finish
with
just
a
touch
of
umami
like
it
o
could
be
better
but
highly
drinkable
o
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
it
is
tasty
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
but
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
samuel

white
lantern
35
m
nothing
fabulous
here
but
good
indeed
very
crisp
and
will
definitely
buy
again
o
bbc
just
isnt
too
great
at
making
witbiers
they
all
taste
the
same
and
thoroughly
mediocre
i
got
this
white
lantern
in
a
sam
variety
pack
it
pour
a
cloudy
very
light
yellow
the
smell
is
sweet
and
lemony
not
too
pungent
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
light
you
deff
get
a
really
sweet
lemony
flavor
its
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
beer
would
be
really
great
on
the
warmer
end
of
the
spring
time
pours
a
slightly
hazy
medium
apple
juice
with
a
smallish
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
wisps
of
foam
on
top
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
orange
and
a
bit
spicy
with
coriander
and
a
hint
of
fruity
spicy
wheat
the
flavor
is
malty
orange
with
a
spicy
edge
its
a
bit
sweet
with
light
sugar
and
fruity
malt
and
a
bit
of
spice
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
decent
beer
i
could
drink
it
but
im
not
sure
i
would
want
to
it
just
not
my
thing
medium
bodied
but
fuller
than
expected
with
a
prominent
wheatbready
yeast
flavor
that
overpowers
the
peppery
spice
and
citrus
sweetness
slightly
zesty
with
coriander
ginger
and
white
pepper
notes
followed
by
hints
of
blood
orange
tangerine
and
grapefruit
but
the
bread
and
banana
flavors
are
too
strong
for
my
liking
making
it
a
bit
one
dimensional
very
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
more
spice
and
citrus
flavor
i
dont
mind
this
at
all
i
thought
i
might
turn
on
it
but
i
can
drink
it
pretty
easily
and
it
tastes
decent
i
hate
when
brewers
make
their
wheat
ales
undercarbonated
sticky
and
bodyhefty
this
one
drinks
like
a
summery
ale
but
with
agreeable
cool
weather
spiciness
editjust
realized
it
was
a
wit
not
a
hefe
my
review
is
skewed
but
the
impression
of
the
taste
still
stands
i
simply
may
not
be
a
wit
beer
guy
overall
a
rather
robust
and
plenty
tasty
wit
o
an
easydrinking
wit
with
a
fairly
simplistic
aroma
and
taste
far
from
the
complex
belgians
that
im
used
to
its
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
a
little
too
simple
for
the
style
o
the
smell
is
inviting
the
taste
is
fairly
simple
but
good
the
feel
would
be
better
with
lower
carbonation
white
lantern
is
an
ok
wit
overall
its
decent
but
isnt
my
favorite
wit
nor
my
favorite
from
sam
adams
overall
an
ok
beer
another
one
of
boston
beers
wheat
beer
experiments
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
ok
beer
and
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
the
taste
and
aroma
were
very
true
to
style
and
were
much
more
intense
then
most
but
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
brought
this
beer
down
this
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
fairly
smooth
but
the
flavors
lost
my
interest
quickly
and
combined
with
the
sweeetness
they
would
become
too
much
for
me
to
drink
multiples
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
the
aroma
and
taste
were
they
were
just
what
i
expect
from
the
style
and
a
little
more
intense
then
most
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
too
thick
with
not
enough
carbonation
if
those
were
fixed
i
think
it
would
help
the
drinkability
a
little
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
on
its
own
its
a
good
for
what
it
isnt
but
it
isnt
something
that
i
have
the
urge
to
buy
again
but
i
do
recommend
giving
it
a
try
if
your
a
witbier
fan
and
this
might
make
a
good
choice
for
you
blue
moon
drinking
friends
all
in
all
i
thought
this
was
a
solid
witbier
it
had
some
good
aspects
and
some
bad
aspects
but
it
sill
came
together
alright
and
i
would
rather
have
this
than
a
blue
moon
another
solid
beer
from
samuel
adams
the
kings
of
solid
beers
might
be
good
on
a
really
hot
day
when
you
a
light
beer
with
some
citrus
to
quench
your
thirst
c
a
new
sam
adams
brew
this
one
is
yellowgold
and
hazy
the
head
is
bright
white
but
not
longlived
its
aroma
is
of
wheat
twang
citrus
and
spice
it
is
a
little
muted
especially
compared
to
the
flavorful
taste
soft
sweet
and
wheat
it
has
a
subtle
spice
and
a
fullness
that
is
enjoyable
very
nice
beer
it
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
gold
with
a
white
head
the
head
has
nice
retention
lacing
doesnt
really
kick
in
until
there
is
just
a
thin
layer
of
foam
atop
the
beer
the
aroma
is
full
of
intense
orange
and
the
tangerine
is
noticeable
corriander
and
malt
are
definitely
present
as
well
the
taste
pretty
follows
the
aroma
lots
of
orange
and
hints
of
malt
the
corriander
kind
of
gets
lost
among
teh
muck
here
as
it
is
slightly
citrusy
it
has
a
moderate
mouthfeel
although
it
is
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
light
and
relatively
gentle
i
love
it
its
not
too
simple
and
its
not
so
complex
that
you
get
lost
in
a
jungle
of
aroma
and
flavor
this
beer
knows
what
it
is
highly
recommended

overall
i
guess
this
wobbly
pop
is
ok
easy
to
drink
and
easy
on
the
wallet
unless
u
live
in
cali
appearantly
i
guess
what
my
problems
with
this
and
other
recent
sa
selections
is
that
its
obviously
brewed
for
the
masses
forced
into
stores
waaaay
too
early
its
still
jan
in
new
england
and
spring
beers
are
better
in
spring
and
ever
since
sa
got
rid
of
the
white
ale
every
seasonal
12er
has
some
lame
attempt
at
originality
stick
with
what
git
u
there
jim
not
a
bad
beer
overall
really
great
for
a
warm
summer
day
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
12oz
bottle
purchased
as
part
of
this
years
spring
mix
pack
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
body
with
nearly
an
inch
of
white
head
coriander
dominates
the
aroma
with
citrus
and
pith
and
citrus
lemon
orange
pith
and
a
fair
bit
of
spice
toward
the
finish
of
the
flavor
light
in
body
and
carbonation
not
bad
a
decent
example
of
the
style
overall
not
a
bad
beer
here
the
flavors
are
fresh
and
not
artificial
tasting
i
normally
dont
like
to
draw
comparisons
to
other
beers
in
reviews
but
the
flavor
here
is
very
similar
to
magic
hat
9
a
crafty
fruit
beer
with
a
wheat
base
this
is
a
gateway
beer
to
lead
the
masses
to
craft
even
as
a
seasoned
beer
drinker
i
have
to
say
this
isnt
too
shabby
color
is
a
hazy
orange
eric
will
never
seek
out
purchase
or
drink
again
interesting
a
beer
thats
overwhelmed
by
the
spices
not
bad
but
nothing
id
go
out
of
my
way
for
again
decent
enough
overall
nice
tasting
beer
to
start
off
your
day
as
it
stands
right
now
this
is
my
favorite
beer
came
home
to
my
parents
house
after
months
away
and
found
one
in
the
refrigerator
havent
seen
another
one
since
wonderfully
balanced
and
the
flavor
is
near
perfect
good
for
any
time
of
the
year
summer
especially
good

something
to
session
or
introduce
with
and
probably
better
on
a
hot
day
but
not
a
flawed
beer
just
not
super
interesting
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
interesting
not
the
kind
of
thing
i
could
see
myself
having
more
than
one
of
in
a
sitting
and
all
of
the
flavoring
makes
me
eager
to
try
cooking
with
it
bottle
poured
a
light
golden
color
ale
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
of
coriander
and
sage
is
quite
dominant
with
light
sweet
wheat
malt
notes
also
noticeable
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sage
with
quite
a
bit
of
coriander
light
orange
peel
and
light
wheat
malt
with
some
light
residual
sugar
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
quite
enjoyed
the
spice
mix
but
a
fuller
malt
profile
would
have
also
been
beneficial
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
oas
it
warms
the
balance
gets
worse
and
worse
for
the
style
i
do
not
think
this
beer
delivers
anything
spectacular
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
initial
pour
provided
an
intriguing
blast
of
sage
with
citrus
notes
and
some
grain
mixed
in
as
well
across
the
palate
i
get
less
of
the
rounded
wheat
characteristics
from
other
examples
of
this
style
but
it
isnt
substantially
off
corriander
spice
and
citurs
are
the
primary
flavors
wafting
across
the
palate
as
the
beer
goes
down
would
not
have
guessed
there
is
rye
in
the
mash
easy
drinking
and
inoffensive
this
beer
would
refresh
on
a
summer
afternoon
but
wont
cause
revelation
overall
worth
trying
but
not
something
i
need
to
have
again
it
was
ok
refreshing
enough
and
good
enough
beer
to
drink
a
couple
was
enough
though
overall
interesting
enough
to
warrant
trying
once
not
something
id
buy
a
six
pack
of
though
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
on
and
feels
kind
of
like
a
bunch
of
ingredients
thrown
together
rather
than
one
cohesive
taste
drinkable
and
a
bit
refreshing
even
but
not
something
i
will
seek
out
again
the
2
in
the
summer
sampler
pack
were
enough
bottom
line
i
really
dont
enjoy
this
beer
much
too
sweet
and
too
many
competing
flavor
profiles
take
away
from
this
overall
enjoyed
more
than
i
had
anticipated
what
can
i
say
i
like
a
little
sage
from
time
to
time
o
not
bad
not
great
the
witbier
element
is
too
subtle
its
more
of
a
spiced
beer
than
anything
else
with
that
said
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
overall
this
is
a
nice
little
pool
side
brew
i
like
the
sage
addition
it
plays
pretty
well
in
this
brew
definitely
worth
a
shot
o
a
decent
beer
a
good
entry
into
the
spiciness
of
rye
malt
without
being
overpowering
good
summer
beer
d
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
is
going
on
with
this
one
way
too
heavy
handed
with
the
sage
maybe
if
the
formula
was
actually
a
witbier
with
just
a
hint
of
the
herb
then
maybe
this
one
is
all
out
of
whack
taste
starts
out
with
a
light
citrusy
presence
rye
is
a
bit
more
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
isnt
really
a
strong
presence
nor
adds
enough
spiciness
to
be
a
twist
on
a
witbier
carbonation
is
nice
and
high
bit
of
an
odd
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
the
kind
from
eating
the
rind
of
an
orange
peel
overall
a
unique
twist
on
the
wheat
ale
style
the
spices
kind
of
overpower
everything
but
the
taste
is
decent
overall
o
a
fairly
decent
wheat
beer
tasty
and
refreshing
overall
im
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
mainly
because
i
dont
like
belgian
whitbiers
and
german
weissbiers
that
being
said
the
flavors
are
interesting
and
im
assuming
that
its
a
pretty
good
example
of
what
a
belgianstyle
whitbier
is
supposed
to
taste
like
overall
a
very
good
beer
not
sure
why
this
beer
has
such
mediocre
reviews
for
a
summer
beer
in
a
taster
pack
this
is
really
solid
id
definitely
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
for
hot
summer
sipping
12oz
bottle
best
before
december
served
in
imperial
pint
glass
beer
is
pale
yellow
and
just
slightly
cloudy
with
a
very
thin
white
head
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
orange
peel
with
a
hint
of
coriander
in
the
back
but
nothing
to
blow
away
your
senses
ooh
very
fizzy
and
once
i
get
through
the
intense
carbonation
the
coriander
flavor
is
really
dominant
and
past
that
the
beer
is
way
sweet
i
find
the
herbaceousness
is
the
harshest
part
of
this
beer
and
along
with
the
intense
carbonation
it
makes
for
an
outright
unpleasant
drink
i
find
myself
wanting
either
higher
more
hops
to
up
the
raw
ibus
of
this
beer
or
simply
higher
attenuation
to
dry
it
out
oh
and
the
label
promised
a
rye
beer
but
theres
only
the
most
subtle
rye
flavor
hiding
behind
all
this
sweetness
and
flavoring
nonsense
i
guess
the
idea
of
a
rye
wit
was
novel
but
ill
pass
next
time
the
extra
spice
makes
this
one
unique
but
still
another
pretty
mediocre
overorangey
witbier
drinkability
it
was
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
but
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
overall
a
interesting
take
similar
to
philadelphia
brewing
companys
fleur
de
lehigh
the
rye
is
interesting
take
overall
an
okay
wit
too
much
spice
for
me
however
id
only
want
one
of
these
poured
this
witbier
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
orange
color
produced
a
thick
head
that
has
decent
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
malted
grain
spicy
rye
and
sage
medium
bodied
there
is
a
base
of
spicy
rye
sage
and
white
pepper
crisp
easy
to
drink
the
use
of
sage
and
rye
gives
a
spicy
twist
to
a
classic
beer
style
overall
a
strange
muddle
of
flavors
not
such
a
great
idea
pours
a
golden
slight
hazy
color
pretty
clear
for
the
style
with
white
head
and
dissipates
rather
fast
the
smell
is
that
of
the
traditional
witbier
with
the
addition
of
some
other
uncommon
fruit
and
spices
notes
which
gives
it
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
is
is
mostly
of
rye
and
sage
than
that
of
the
traditional
witbier
the
mouth
feel
is
rather
watery
and
disappointing
i
feel
that
the
addition
of
sage
and
rye
to
a
witbier
is
something
that
was
a
good
idea
but
could
have
had
a
better
execution
this
seems
like
good
beer
for
the
warm
days
of
summer
and
it
seems
like
a
beer
that
will
pique
the
interest
of
many
and
raise
some
eyebrows
due
to
the
unusual
flavor
profile
i
dont
know
if
i
will
be
seeking
it
out
anytime
soon
but
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
does
have
some
good
things
to
offer
overall
people
on
this
site
slam
sam
adams
for
not
being
craft
but
i
fail
to
see
how
throwing
orange
coriander
and
sage
into
a
beer
fails
to
make
it
craft
its
a
unique
beer
good
for
a
onetime
drink
but
im
not
sure
i
would
want
to
drink
again
a
decent
beer
but
the
sage
is
too
off
putting
its
not
fantastic
but
its
an
interesting
new
beer
to
try
from
the
summer
mixer12
packs
do
eyeopening
rye
breaks
up
what
is
otherwise
a
parade
of
expected
features
wit
beers
work
best
when
they
are
treated
with
delicacy
but
this
is
typical
of
its
makers
clumsiness
with
the
style
hopefully
others
will
see
in
this
a
needed
new
direction
for
the
style
and
make
it
happen
with
more
favorable
results
overall
now
that
ive
tasted
this
beer
im
shocked
by
how
low
its
rated
to
me
it
was
balanced
interesting
and
wellmade
sort
of
an
american
take
on
a
classic
belgian
style
and
it
performs
well
o
overall
this
beer
is
not
very
original
but
that
does
not
mean
its
horrible
its
decent
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
no
sweat
and
no
complaints
and
id
be
alright
with
buying
it
again
id
say
give
it
a
try
overall
i
wasnt
impressed
with
this
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
an
average
at
best
example
of
the
style
the
sage
seemed
interesting
when
i
read
about
it
on
the
label
but
when
i
got
to
the
taste
and
aroma
of
this
beer
the
sage
seemed
to
be
too
overpowering
which
didnt
give
this
beer
the
best
balance
this
beer
didnt
have
good
drinkability
it
was
a
little
tough
to
finish
the
bottle
it
was
a
little
smooth
but
the
overpowering
sage
did
not
hold
my
attention
and
one
would
be
enough
for
me
no
way
would
i
want
to
session
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
they
were
both
nice
and
turned
out
to
be
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
how
overpowering
the
sage
was
it
would
have
been
a
lot
nicer
if
the
sage
was
toned
down
and
the
rye
shined
through
a
little
more
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
its
not
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
and
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
really
like
sage
all
in
all
i
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
one
samuel
adams
generally
knows
what
their
doing
but
they
got
a
little
out
of
hand
with
the
sage
this
time
and
the
beer
suffered
because
of
it
better
luck
next
time
guys
blueberry
hill
lager
was
my
favorite
of
this
years
summer
pack
the
rest
of
the
beers
were
average
at
best
i
think
last
years
summer
pack
was
much
better
i
dont
think
i
will
get
another
one
this
season
pours
orange
tinted
gold
low
to
no
foam
bready
rye
nose
orange
rindcoriander
pokes
through
starts
witbier
and
then
takes
a
right
turn
with
the
sagerye
blend
earthy
chalky
hefe
close
just
hints
of
all
the
spices
comes
together
well
reviewers
here
seem
to
be
more
down
than
up
but
i
thought
it
was
decent
definitely
a
unique
and
unusual
flavor
combination
but
this
ones
not
a
favorite
id
care
to
revisit
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
beer
seems
like
a
lighter
version
of
their
summer
ale
with
a
stronger
spice
flavor
so
if
those
two
things
are
what
you
like
in
the
summer
ale
youll
like
this
beer
overall
this
was
part
of
the
sam
adams
summer
sampler
i
picked
up
the
other
beers
were
pretty
good
but
this
one
was
not
my
favorite
in
fact
i
could
not
even
finish
this
beer
fans
of
herbal
beer
would
like
to
check
this
one
out
fans
of
the
witbier
variety
may
be
caught
off
guard
with
this
brew
the
beer
appears
light
golden
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
offers
bready
malts
spice
particularly
coriander
chemicals
and
oddness
a
rye
beer
with
coriander
sounded
pretty
nice
but
this
one
misses
the
mark
entirely
for
me
soapy
and
grainy
no
fun
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
im
sure
its
still
better
than
other
beers
out
there
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
a
foamy
bone
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
tiny
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spice
and
strong
sage
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
spice
and
sage
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
sage
presence
that
is
fairly
dominant
over
any
other
aromas
or
flavors
overall
ok
brew
not
my
first
choice
overall
i
agree
with
everyone
else
this
is
a
very
bland
boring
addition
to
the
summer
variety
pack
even
more
so
than
the
summer
ale
sucks
i
had
ths
poured
into
a
pilsener
glass
im
usually
pretty
excited
to
try
the
sam
seasonal
pack
every
few
months
to
sample
the
couple
of
new
ones
that
they
put
out
this
guy
was
pretty
disappointing
this
is
the
third
different
wheat
rye
beer
ive
tried
and
i
havent
really
liked
any
of
them
so
its
possible
that
i
just
dont
like
the
genre
the
citrus
and
lighter
flavors
of
the
wheat
just
make
for
a
weird
mix
with
the
earthy
spicy
flavors
of
the
sage
and
rye
the
smell
mirrors
the
flavor
is
golden
with
just
a
bit
of
haziness
to
it
which
to
me
shows
that
this
beer
is
really
just
a
mix
of
two
styles
trying
to
be
something
different
not
sure
it
works
so
well
not
an
awful
beer
by
any
means
but
one
of
my
least
favorite
sam
adams
loved
its
appearance
nice
medium
color
and
good
top
however
it
smelled
a
little
dank
which
ive
almost
never
experienced
w
sam
adams
tasted
kinda
dank
too
sour
and
rather
bland
for
a
sam
adams
not
all
that
impressed
w
this
years
summer
variety
pack
trying
the
little
white
rye
its
getting
more
and
more
difficult
to
separate
the
white
ales
and
lagers
from
sammy
a
while
the
little
white
rye
is
slightly
different
than
the
others
it
still
follows
the
same
path
the
beer
pours
a
semihazy
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
is
not
lacing
the
smell
has
a
spice
and
rye
flare
the
taste
carries
a
orange
peel
coriander
spice
that
clear
the
pallet
quickly
and
finishes
dry
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
ok
but
not
enough
for
me
to
go
crazy
and
by
a
6
12
or
24
the
revolutionary
rye
was
much
better
light
citrusy
aroma
pleasing
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
thick
bright
white
head
head
has
good
retention
taste
is
mildly
sweet
and
citrusy
notes
of
spice
that
are
not
overpowering
nicely
carbonated
refreshing
mouthfeel
definitely
a
pour
me
another
my
pour
created
a
finger
of
eggshellwhite
head
with
moderate
retention
that
was
of
no
matter
as
it
was
the
nose
that
really
got
my
attention
the
kitchen
began
to
smell
like
potpourri
color
was
a
hazy
deepgold
with
a
cloudy
core
as
though
i
should
have
better
agitated
it
in
the
bottle
before
pouring
leaning
in
i
caught
a
good
whiff
of
lemon
zest
orange
peel
black
pepper
and
a
general
spiciness
oh
my
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
quite
citrusy
initially
then
the
spiciness
took
over
on
the
tongue
finish
was
quite
dry
and
refreshing
thanks
to
the
interplay
of
the
spices
i
am
not
sure
that
i
got
the
rye
unless
that
was
the
source
of
the
black
pepper
no
matter
this
was
tasty
and
a
welcome
addition
to
a
hazy
humid
day
in
midspring
one
more
that
i
hope
makes
it
into
cans
for
the
summer
just
sayin
overall
a
bit
too
spicy
for
many
but
it
barely
crosses
the
line
for
me
i
might
revisit
this
if
the
rest
of
the
samplers
are
tasty
enough
its
a
good
beer
a
decent
wit
the
rye
seems
to
mellow
the
coriander
a
bit
but
the
beer
still
drinks
bright
well
its
interesting
a
bit
too
leafyherbal
for
my
taste
but
it
works
well
enough
overall
to
be
drinkable
i
had
no
trouble
drinking
both
in
the
variety
pack
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
overall
this
has
too
much
citrus
peel
and
herbs
boston
beer
co
listen
not
every
beer
you
make
needs
citrus
peel
or
coriander
not
to
mention
spice
rack
herbs
bleh
over
spiced
and
the
flavors
just
dont
work
pass
on
this
one
overall
an
easy
drinking
wit
with
a
bit
of
rye
and
some
other
lighter
flavors
incorporated
within
while
nothing
of
extraordinary
regard
it
was
tasty
and
makes
for
a
nice
summer
style
brew
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
thick
white
head
and
lots
of
visible
rising
bubbles
the
nose
is
full
of
orange
coriander
and
sage
i
also
get
some
peppery
rye
which
adds
more
spiciness
to
the
bright
aromas
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
the
wheat
and
barley
adding
some
nice
backbone
to
this
beer
the
citrus
does
meld
well
with
the
rye
coriander
and
sage
theres
that
spiciness
and
earthy
quality
that
balances
out
the
citrus
pretty
well
theres
also
a
bit
of
tartness
in
the
flavor
the
body
is
light
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
smooth
mouthfeel
the
beer
drinks
pretty
well
this
is
a
good
beer
that
hits
the
right
notes
and
works
as
a
refreshing
summer
beer

this
is
the
best
of
them
all
says
i
o
well
sometimes
sam
adams
makes
really
good
seasonals
and
other
times
you
wonder
what
they
were
thinking
they
just
got
a
little
to
clever
for
their
own
good
with
this
one
why
do
they
make
so
many
of
their
summerspring
beers
so
sweet
aroma
of
noble
hops
it
seemed
initially
though
an
artificial
lemonflowery
nature
becomes
more
prominent
as
the
cap
settles
sage
comes
across
more
as
rosemary
on
the
nose
while
the
coriander
and
rye
escape
me
when
cold
especially
hop
aroma
adds
a
pine
character
with
exposure
rye
texture
is
quite
prominent
in
the
taste
while
the
lemon
notes
return
on
the
finish
rye
gives
the
feel
a
fullish
body
while
the
citrus
keeps
it
in
check
though
it
does
get
a
bit
harsh
for
the
style
with
warming
overall
pretty
decent
brew
and
a
bit
of
a
different
tack
it
interesting
enough
but
a
little
overspiced
for
my
tastes
if
you
like
corriander
laden
brews
this
is
for
you
hazed

color
under

and

a

prominent
grainy

up
midsip
and

around
orange
peel
and
coriander
sweetness
transition
to
a
lavenderlike
floral
note
and
faint

an
interesting
take
on
the
style
for
sure
i
really
like
the
fresh
grain
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
perhaps
a
touch
undercarbonated

a
solid

on

put

in

this

exceeded
my

served

the
beer
poured
a
hazey
golden
color
with
a
thick
short
lived
white

aroma
was
malty
with
clove
honey
and
citrus
the
beer
was
light
on
the
palate
with
a
slight
hops
finish
and
tasted
like
it
smelled
of
cloves
and
citrus
i
have
never
had
a
rye
beer
so
i
really
am
unable
to
make
a
comparison
but
overall
i
thought
the
beer
was
very
nice
i
will
give
the
mouthfeel
a
little
bit
better
than
average
rating
as
i
enjoy
the
yeasty
aftertaste
the
brew
seems
to
get
better
as
it
warms
hazy
and
goldenyellow
in
color
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lace
average
but
nicelooking
beer
the
smell
is
interesting
lots
of
pepper
seems
like
a
mix
of
white
and
black
pepper
and
something
a
bit
more
exotic
earthy
and
spicy
some
underlying
stone
fruit
the
taste
is
similar
the
spice
and
pepper
kick
in
quickly
not
much
malt
drier
than
i
expected
i
dont
get
rye
but
there
is
a
notable
grain
streak
running
through
the
beer
fairly
full
in
body
full
carbonation
drinkable
and
interesting
but
not
something
that
would
entice
me
again
and
again
pale
copper
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
fine
speckled
lacing
with
a
hazed
finish
the
nose
is
full
of
sage
and
coriander
spicy
rye
upfront
in
the
nares
with
the
sagecoriander
combo
not
a
bad
beer
flavor
its
seeping
through
with
all
of
those
lets
put
into
perspective
harsh
spicy
flavor
full
of
a
wave
of
coriander
and
sage
with
mixed
vegetable
green
notes
full
bodied
slick
mouthfeel
cant
wish
or
wait
for
much
more
overall
this
beer
is
a
job
and
somebody
has
got
to
do
it
pairings
it
would
taste
good
with
corned
beef
and
cabbage
as
i
poured
this
beer
i
instantly
received
a
nice
scent
of
citrus
and
a
nice
lite
colored
beer
the
first
sip
was
very
refreshing
and
tasteful
with
a
nice
fruity
aftertaste
the
flaver
of
this
beer
stayed
with
me
for
a
long
time
before
i
took
my
next
sip
i
look
for
summer
time
and
hot
weather
to
try
this
again
12

and
lively

aroma
is
of
wheat
malt
ripe
fruit
and
spices
body
is
full
and
crisp
taste
is
of
spices
sweet
malt
citrus
and
cotton
candy
finish
is
earthy
spicy
and
sweet
as
well
nice
summer
brew
it
does
taste
exactly
like
a
wit
but
its
just
different
enough
to
be
interesting
spices
are
well
moderated
and
nothing
stands
out
by
itself
i
wouldnt
have
identified
the
rye
either
but
overall
there
is
a
pleasant
malty
smoothness
with
some
sharper
notes
a
faint
bitterness
at
the
end
along
with
that
rye
back
of
the
throat
scratch
well
made
sudsy
and
fairly
rich
for
a
witbier
kind
of
an
interesting
beer
here
has
an
unusual
flavor
kind
of
a
nice
change
of
pace
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
summer
pack
wouldnt
mind
another
bottle
or
two
of
it
d
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
its
worth
a
try
and
is
quite
sessionable
i
just
find
sam
adams
attempt
at
styles
like
this
to
be
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
i
had
no
idea
sage
came
in
various
colors
much
less
white
but
yet
again
beer
has
taught
me
something
about
the
world
at
large
gotta
love
it
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
light
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
orange
zest
spicy
greenery
which
i
assume
is
the
sage
peeking
through
black
pepper
light
coriander
and
a
pinch
of
what
seems
like
banana
peel
the
taste
throws
some
sweetness
on
the
orange
and
ratchets
that
citrus
a
couple
notches
but
dont
you
fret
none
darlin
the
spices
particularly
that
damn
sage
shine
through
in
the
finish
lingering
their
momentarily
making
sure
my
tastebuds
fucking
savor
their
very
existence
its
not
a
pleasurable
encounter
sadly
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
what
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
decent
wit
is
torpedoed
by
the
addition
of
the
sage
i
kinda
wanna
know
reasoning
what
led
to
that
particular
conclusion
cause
it
musta
been
in
a
fairly
purple
haze
another
sam
seasonal
that
i
can
pass
on
o
definitely
not
your
typical
wit
the
combo
of
sage
coriander
and
rye
dont
really
mix
all
that
well
especially
once
the
orange
peel
comes
into
play
gets
better
as
it
warms
but
it
really
isnt
anything
more
than
average
overall
decent
brew
but
its
not
my
bag
i
wish
breweries
would
stop
using
sage
or
most
herbs
really
in
their
beers
it
just
doesnt
fit
in
my
opinion
for
a
beer
with
rye
in
its
name
its
odd
that
the
sage
character
is
more
prominently
featured
but
maybe
thats
just
me
i
wouldnt
care
to
have
this
again
o
very
pleasant
i
enjoyed
this
beer
with
a
pork
chop
dinner
a
very
understated
brew
but
very
refreshing
not
the
most
creative
witbier
reminds
me
of
a
lighter
spicier
blue
moon
i
have
to
say
this
was
better
than
i
anticipated
better
than
the
average
summer
brew
ive
concluded
that
this
beer
is
ok
it
doesnt
really
draw
me
in
really
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
little
white
rye
it
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
tinge
of
cloudiness
there
is
sage
in
this
beer
and
i
comes
hard
to
the
nose
the
taste
is
clean
not
too
bitter
and
the
sage
creeps
in
at
the
back
and
its
not
too
over
powering
i
think
it
makes
for
a
really
interesting
beer
the
over
all
taste
is
light
enough
to
go
into
a
summer
collection
box
which
is
where
i
got
it
i
do
have
to
give
them
props
for
the
sage
flavor
i
have
had
some
other
herbal
beers
in
the
past
that
made
me
feel
like
i
was
drinking
soup
but
little
white
rye
has
enough
sage
to
be
interesting
with
out
the
over
all
beer
being
off
putting
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
my
first
thought
was
that
it
tasted
like
a
crispier
blue
moon
the
smell
is
enjoyable
and
the
taste
is
slightly
more
so
the
citrus
and
spice
are
wrapped
in
a
wheattasting
body
a
certain
spice
lingers
in
your
throat
after
each
drink
its
not
a
bad
drink
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
however
i
do
like
that
spicypeppery
burn
aftertaste
o
i
just
wasnt
feeling
this
one
the
sage
notes
left
a
funny
aftertaste
not
my
favorite
sam
adams
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
sam
adams
needs
to
release
this
in
6packs
addendum
resampled
today
yes
this
is
a
good
beer
sell
in
six
packs
please
a
nice
beer
i
would
buy
it
again
low
c
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
bottle
states
it
is
an
ale
brewed
with
orange
peel
and
coriander
with
sage
added
it
has
a
nice
smell
smells
like
summer
with
a
tad
bit
of
citrus
smell
definitely
has
a
slight
citrus
flavor
a
small
amount
of
activity
when
poured
not
a
lot
of
texture
but
that
suits
its
summer
billing
would
certainly
be
a
good
summer
grilling
out
beer
to
accompany
some
backyard
food
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
on
top
there
is
a
decent
scattered
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
strong
with
sage
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
orange
peel
on
the
nose
also
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
herbal
some
subtle
citrus
there
is
a
spice
note
in
there
also
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
smooth
nicely
carbonated
and
drinkable
overall
its
a
decent
beer
more
of
a
gruit
than
a
wit
to
me
a
decent
ryeinfused
ale
that
would
add
a
little
more
character
to
a
hot
summer
day
looking
forward
to
those
too
much
pepperanise
in
the
taste
profile
that
really
detracted
especially
since
it
lingers
in
the
finish
as
a
lover
of
white
ales
and
wheat
beers
im
really
enjoying
this
hot
summer
day
and
this
hit
the
spot
overall
this
brew
took
some
getting
used
to
i
did
not
like
it
the
first
time
i
had
it
but
the
second
time
is
a
charm
it
has
grown
on
me
there
are
other
wheat
beers
out
there
that
are
better
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
the
coriander
and
dried
curacao
orange
peels
used
to
create
a
clean
finish
with
just
a
hint
of
tart
spiciness
missed
the
mark
imho
too
fruity
for
me
to
drink
more
than
one
but
feminine
flowery
perfumy
if
you
like
em
that
way
overall
refreshing
and
sessionable
very
good
wit
beer
o
tasty
refreshing
would
be
a
good
session
beer
no
flaws
but
overall
unmemorable
needs
a
longer
finish
o
one
of
the
stranger
wits
you
may
come
across
not
great
flavorwise
but
ridiculously
drinkable
oweyerbacher
is
my
second
favorite
brewery
but
this
one
is
a
miss
its
not
actively
bad
but
its
not
especially
good
either
just
bleh
i
expect
better
from
these
folks
overall
a
serviceable
wit
served
in
a
16
oz
pint
glass
at
mcmichaels
pub
gloucester
city
nj
overall
i
could
see
this
appealing
to
some
folks
on
a
summer
day
but
i
personally
wished
for
more
sweetness
and
less
tartness
considering
the
style
this
beer
reminded
me
of
both
seltzer
water
with
lemon
and
dry
champagne
and
i
wonder
if
this
was
really
what
weyerbacher
was
going
for
i
paired
it
with
blue
cheese
pita
chips
and
green
olives
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bright
golden
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
and
average
carbonation
smells
of
lemon
and
other
citrusy
things
average
light
penetration
not
overly
sweet
for
a
wheat
but
refreshing
no
real
lacing
not
bitter
but
has
that
citrus
zing
to
it
a
refreshing
taste
but
nothing
spectacular
while
i
have
nothing
really
bad
to
say
about
this
beer
it
is
at
the
end
of
the
day
average
nothing
amazing
or
poor
about
it
what
can
i
say
it
is
basically
hoegarden
from
weyerbacher
o
this
beer
is
both
easy
to
drink
and
refreshingit
makes
for
a
good
selection
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
so
far
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
light
summer
brews
ive
tried
this
year
really
is
a
combination
of
a
blanche
and
wheat
beer
would
have
again
especially
out
on
the
deck
on
a
summer
night
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
aftertaste
of
banana
and
a
little
bit
of
pineapple
oa
decent
summer
beer
refreshing
and
day
drinkability
pours
hazy
dirty
blonde
with
some
white
foam
mostly
burns
off
wheaty
nose
some
orange
wit
beer
taste
with
some
orangecoriander
notes
grains
of
paradise
taste
lemon
too
good
mixture
not
great
a
decent
wit
not
sure
that
i
recall
seeing
this
before
i
may
not
seek
it
out
again
but
you
never
know
maybe
i
will
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
thirst
quencher
though
nothing
special
its
an
enjoyable
brew
and
at
only
4
5
you
could
pound
these
all
day
long
pours
light
yellow
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
it
actually
looks
like
lemonade
with
foam
the
smell
isnt
all
that
impressive
either
smells
of
spices
almost
like
the
merry
monk
but
with
a
bit
of
a
funk
to
it
at
least
the
taste
is
better
than
the
smell
but
still
not
all
that
great
kind
of
like
a
merry
monk
light
im
noticing
that
many
of
the
weyerbacher
ales
taste
very
similar
just
different
amount
of
spice
in
each
not
all
that
impressed
with
this
and
i
would
not
buy
again
o
enjoyable
warm
weather
beer
a
halfway
desent
beer
thoug
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
not
very
balanced
o
definitely
a
repeat
summer
purchase
nice
american
wit
enjoyed
on
a
beautiful
spring
day
nice
citrus
notes
good
light
honey
color
slight
onefinger
head
that
fizzles
out
quickly
while
leaving
nice
lacing
murky
which
i
like
a
lot
and
is
a
mark
of
a
wellbrewed
wit
smells
of
citrus
banana
overall
very
nice
american
wit
comparable
to
some
belgium
or
dutch
varieties
that
ive
had
more
sweet
than
sour
but
its
a
good
blend
of
the
two
i
detect
blueberry
and
strawberry
notes
id
say
this
has
a
bit
of
a
kool
aid
taste
very
little
wheat
flavor
refreshing
no
hop
the
body
is
a
bit
richer
than
one
would
expect
the
carbonation
is
also
elevated
o
maybe
a
good
summer
beer
but
far
from
the
beers
i
have
been
known
to
call
wits
fresh
and
refreshing
but
again
nothing
like
any
wit
ive
had
before
i
do
enjoy
it
this
is
just
closer
to
a
shandy
or
radler
than
a
wit
imo
dont
get
what
they
were
trying
to
do
here
with
all
the
lemon
flavor
though
overall
interesting
not
what
i
expected
from
weyerbacher
which
i
figured
over
sweet
over
spiced
almost
undrinkable
but
instead
nice
wheat
flavors
citrus
spices
are
done
fairly
well
strong
but
not
overboard
and
nice
overall
profile
drinkable
for
a
summer
style
beer
overall
after
finishing
my
beer
im
happy
to
report
that
weyerbachers
craft
is
firmly
intact
that
said
id
still
reach
for
a
yuengling
before
i
would
a
weyerbacher
blanche
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
a
great
beer
but
definitely
worth
drinking
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
beer
its
simplistic
and
lack
any
spices
but
it
has
a
citrusy
drinkable
flavor
nonetheless
this
isnt
my
favorite
wit
but
it
is
better
than
a
few
others
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
in
the
future
half
finger
head
on
a
hazy
straw
body
aroma
is
very
mild
with
mostly
wheat
and
little
else
the
body
is
creamy
with
moderate
carbonation
flavor
is
also
bland
with
wheat
and
very
light
malts
non
descript
sweetness
overall
highly
drinkable
but
so
is
water
not
exciting
but
definitely
refreshing
overall
while
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
it
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
and
good
for
a
nice
summer
day
o
an
excellent
summer
ale
not
quite
up
to
traditional
wit
beer
standards
but
quaffable
and
refeshing
a
must
try
notes
a
solid
witbier
nicely
drinkable
cheers
d
very
drinkable
beer
i
dont
like
wit
beers
and
i
can
easily
drink
this
beer
all
day
overall
i
may
want
to
try
this
again
fresh
springtime
next
year
and
rereview
it
yet
i
have
never
seen
a
witbier
drop
off
so
quickly
in
all
aspects
overall
it
is
an
ok
representation
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
but
not
especially
flavorful
overall
an
awesome
summer
beer
two
steps
up
from
something
like
shock
top
or
blue
moon
definitely
a
top
notch
wit
i
really
like
this
one
o
this
is
a
nice
drinkable
belgian
wit
while
there
are
far
better
examples
out
there
this
is
worth
a
try
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
simple
and
refreshing
witbier
overall
a
decent
witbier
to
add
to
the
list
happy
to
see
another
regional
brewery
give
this
style
a
try
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
a
little
more
spices
in
the
beer
but
happy
with
what
they
offered
a
light
beer
with
a
flavor
just
robust
enough
to
make
it
standout
in
the
style
more
lemon
than
orange
a
light
touch
of
the
banana
and
clove
give
it
a
spicy
note
that
is
very
pleasant
from
the
12
oz
bottle
mnice
chew
and
carbonation
a
bit
thick
in
a
good
way
from
the
wheat
perfect
to
style
o
nearly
flawless
weyerbachers
take
on
a
witbier
leaves
me
going
mmmm
a
good
summertime
brew
ive
had
better
but
this
is
true
to
the
style
ok
not
must
have
overall
a
pretty
basic
by
the
book
witbier
what
it
lacks
in
boldness
and
big
flavors
it
makes
up
in
drinkability
not
a
beer
id
seek
out
but
still
a
decent
witbier
brew
is
solid
and
a
great
drinker
typical
for
the
style
a
good
representation
nice
wheat
brew
this
beer
pours
a
bold
clear
yellow
with
finger
thick
head
and
nice
lace
to
the
finish
the
aroma
is
lemony
with
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
grass
the
flavor
is
lemon
with
notes
of
hay
and
mild
hops
with
a
mildly
dry
vinous
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
weyerbacher
blanche
is
a
good
beer
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
a
good
pairing
with
tuna
broccolli
casserole
recommended
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
clear
yellow
body
with
a
white
fizzy
head
that
lays
down
quickly
the
smell
is
light
of
fruits
mostly
pear
the
taste
is
very
dominate
of
pear
and
then
some
wheat
also
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
and
smooth
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
o
great
drinkability
the
profile
is
sweet
and
loaded
with
white
fruit
weyerbacher
blance
pours
a
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
a
finger
of
persistent
white
foam
lacing
is
nonexistent
though
which
is
very
disappointing
the
nose
has
a
very
present
orange
smell
but
at
the
expense
of
just
about
any
other
smell
that
might
show
itself
theres
a
little
bit
of
wheat
too
but
thats
about
it
the
flavor
displays
a
similar
disregard
for
balance
theres
a
little
bit
of
wheaty
sweetness
up
front
and
a
sprinkling
of
light
pepper
but
its
almost
all
orange
theres
none
of
the
subtlety
or
delicate
balance
that
are
found
in
my
favorite
versions
of
the
style
the
mouthfeel
at
least
is
very
good
perfectly
light
and
spritzy
its
impossibly
lively
on
my
palate
weyerbacher
blanche
is
an
absolute
orange
bomb
and
unless
ones
in
a
particular
mood
for
that
i
cant
really
recommend
it
over
some
of
the
other
readily
available
wits
a
clean
finish
of
fruit
and
corriander
leaves
very
little
to
linger
into
the
next
sip
creating
a
very
drinkable
thirst
quencher
that
allows
for
multiple
consumption
and
in
perhaps
large
quantity
o
a
pretty
tasty
beer
but
certainly
nothing
to
rave
over
it
is
okay
though
and
it
would
taste
good
just
about
anytime
of
the
year
olike
this
beer
it
is
a
good
one
to
have
around
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
in
regards
to
the
summer
seasonals
the
aroma
was
full
of
grain
and
slight
spices
some
small
fruit
notes
pears
mainly
with
a
touch
of
apple
but
this
hay
like
spice
kept
everything
going
rich
notes
of
grass
and
hay
opened
it
up
and
melded
seemlessly
into
a
pear
driven
fruity
yeast
body
very
intresting
and
quite
complex
but
then
the
smack
of
the
spice
hit
you
and
it
was
all
over
really
intense
here
as
the
almost
pepper
like
notes
bounced
all
over
the
tongue
and
really
just
put
on
a
great
show
smooth
as
silk
o
nicely
done
classic
styled
witbeir
it
is
interesting
enough
and
at
5
0
abv
it
makes
a
good
session
beer
moreys
bottom
line
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
enjoy
them
now
and
again
during
the
summertime
this
one
is
pretty
good
id
say
that
its
above
average
not
something
that
i
would
seek
out
but
im
glad
that
i
picked
up
a
bottle
it
was
light
enough
to
drink
many
of
these
without
getting
overwhelmed
too
bad
the
flavors
ran
thin
not
bad
but
it
seems
a
little
heavy
handed
on
the
coriander
as
with
most
witbiers
ive
tasted
recently
to
the
point
that
it
develops
some
amount
of
vegetal
character
i
also
feel
like
it
could
use
a
touch
more
orange
still
it
is
light
and
refreshing
and
rather
drinkable
and
i
do
find
myself
enjoying
the
flavor
more
as
i
drink
it
still
ive
had
much
better
examples
of
the
style
o
a
nice
easy
drinking
witbier
but
on
the
bland
side
dont
drink
and
review
overall
a
surprisingly
basic
and
mild
wit
from
a
brewery
that
is
usually
anything
but
basic
and
mild
very
refreshing
the
taste
begins
with
notes
of
lemon
coriander
wheat
cardamom
orange
peel
and
a
much
lesser
amount
of
belgian
yeast
flavor
the
body
is
rather
light
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
pretty
straight
forward
farmhousewitbier
much
less
of
belgian
yeast
character
than
most
of
the
style
definitely
not
necessarily
the
best
ive
had
but
definitely
not
the
worst
a
solid
and
tasty
drinkable
beer
more
american
than
most
which
i
actually
prefer
o
this
is
a
solid
wheat
beer
offering
from
weyerbacher
it
has
a
nice
body
decent
flavor
and
it
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
however
it
can
be
slightly
watery
and
is
not
very
complex
also
for
the
the
price
there
are
many
other
delicious
wheat
beers
both
wit
and
hefe
that
blow
this
out
of
the
water
pours
an
unfiltered
rusty
orange
with
a
finger
of
bright
white
head
that
fades
to
a
collar
and
leaves
some
spotty
lace
nose
of
some
banana
in
a
wit
right
some
peach
and
lemon
citrus
taste
has
even
more
of
this
banana
and
some
light
spicing
more
of
the
lemony
citrus
notes
and
some
wheat
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
watery
but
relatively
refreshing
overall
a
nice
wit
if
resemblant
of
a
thin
hefe
in
my
eyes
nice
and
refreshing
and
good
for
a
hotter
day
flavor
is
seriously
lacking
it
is
very
plain
nothing
really
stands
out
not
yeasty
not
bready
no
banana
or
clove
flavors
really
shine
it
just
needs
something
on
the
other
hand
it
tastes
very
clean
no
off
flavors
or
anything
overall
just
a
little
to
abc
for
me
blanche
pours
out
as
a
traditional
wit
the
color
is
an
opaque
yellow
color
the
head
isnt
as
strong
as
some
that
are
actually
from
belgium
the
aromas
are
almost
all
citrus
this
beer
smells
like
sliced
lemons
and
oranges
its
not
as
pronounced
as
that
but
for
a
beer
its
quite
floral
with
these
fruits
the
flavors
are
a
little
bitey
and
slightly
tart
the
overall
flavors
are
that
this
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
i
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
being
on
the
medium
side
because
its
not
watery
at
the
point
this
is
a
solid
witbier
not
too
bad
really
not
into
this
one
at
all
maybe
with
a
better
yeast
that
added
some
nice
esters
and
belgian
qualities
are
needed
the
beer
really
tastes
like
70
light
wheat
ale
and
30
watered
down
pina
colada
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
and
while
it
isnt
bad
it
just
does
nothing
for
me
if
i
was
on
the
beach
or
at
my
buddies
lake
house
then
i
may
like
it
much
more
on
a
hot
sunny
day
the
smell
is
damn
good
though
an
all
around
good
summer
time
beer
not
a
tremendous
witbier
but
not
bad
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
really
made
me
gag
i
love
weyerbacher
brews
but
this
one
was
just
a
complete
miss
for
me
entirely
too
earthy
and
natural
unpleasant
in
many
ways
the
sickening
sweet
metal
aftertaste
really
got
to
me
one
of
the
very
few
weyerbachers
id
never
buy
again
d
this
seem
like
a
good
solid
witbier
and
at
5
abv
very
sessionable
d
perfect
on
a
summer
and
easy
for
many
types
of
beer
drinkers
to
enjoy
weyerbacher
does
a
nice
job
with
belgianstyle
brews
the
homer
in
me
thinks
that
they
deserve
a
little
more
credit
for
their
offerings
in
general
but
particularly
their
belgianstyle
brews
a
nice
delicate
beer
a
verygood
and
tasty
witbier
im
thnking
with
all
the
spice
that
this
thing
would
pair
up
great
with
a
nice
steak
cheers
and
the
leaving
falls
church
uberbender
continues
to
plow
forth
this
entry
pours
a
partly
cloudy
pale
straw
topped
by
an
active
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
wheat
light
coriander
a
pinch
of
pepper
lemon
flesh
oatmeal
and
sunflower
seeds
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
coriander
wheat
cardamom
orange
peel
and
a
small
conglomeration
of
peppercorns
the
body
is
rather
light
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
solid
wit
not
necessarily
the
best
ive
had
but
tasty
and
drinkable
to
me
it
is
way
too
simple
all
these
need
is
more
yeast
but
i
think
the
style
should
be
clean
so
this
is
a
good
brew
done
treu
to
the
style
d
not
my
style
not
my
beer
falls
flat
in
a
few
areas
notes
a
solid
if
not
entirely
inspiring
witbier
from
weyerbacher
d
i
enjoyed
this
one
of
the
better
wits
i
have
had
the
chance
to
sample
a
refreshing
and
light
wheat
taste
i
could
see
this
as
a
good
beer
for
relaxing
in
the
summer
on
the
deck
good
to
go
for
warm
weather
drinkability
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
and
im
sad
that
i
only
have
one
bottle
i
recommend
this
to
newbie
craft
drinkers
light
malt
yeast
and
wheat
profile
and
highly
non
offnsive
flavor
profiles
d
great
drinkability
aside
from
the
overcarbonation
great
complex
taste
without
being
cloying
drinkability
i
had
this
at
a
weyerbacher
tasting
in
charlotte
with
chris
wilson
i
was
very
impressed
with
this
beer
and
most
of
all
the
weyerbacher
products
d
i
had
such
high
hopes
going
into
this
one
just
from
the
outstanding
nose
however
the
rest
of
this
beer
really
doesnt
hold
up
and
i
feel
like
im
being
tricked
a
little
watery
for
the
most
part
and
lacking
the
real
robust
flavor
im
looking
for
a
one
and
done
for
me
extremely
light
and
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
the
flavor
and
ease
of
drinking
are
definitely
pluses
sessionable
though
it
doesnt
meet
the
controversial
session
beer
max
abv
limitation
a
solid
summer
offering
and
an
easy
drinker
while
probably
my
least
favorite
in
the
variety
pack
i
wouldnt
shy
away
from
this
one
i
will
probably
be
drinking
more
of
this
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
lemons
and
spices
taste
is
a
bit
tart
lots
of
lemon
some
malts
and
spices
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
this
is
fairly
standard
with
the
exception
of
less
citrus
character
and
copious
coriander
it
could
be
a
little
stronger
in
aroma
and
flavor
its
a
good
beer
all
in
all
very
easy
to
drink
this
all
day
low
abv
and
high
refreshment
and
thirst
quenching
a
sold
american
wit
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
a
quarter
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
seconds
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
crispy
wheat
cardamom
and
coriander
this
is
a
little
too
much
cardamom
for
my
liking
but
things
are
still
mildly
balanced
the
taste
still
has
a
lot
of
cardamom
but
not
as
much
as
the
aroma
the
wheat
also
stands
out
more
in
the
taste
too
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
moderately
chewy
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
better
witbiers
out
there
i
cant
see
myself
drinking
this
again
however
if
i
for
some
reason
did
it
would
satisfy
poured
a
bright
yellow
with
less
than
a
finger
of
bright
white
head
but
the
head
deflated
immediately
and
didnt
lace
the
smell
was
fairly
onedimensional
leaning
heavily
on
lemon
zest
with
only
the
slightest
hints
of
spice
clove
coriander
too
mild
to
tell
the
flavor
confirmed
the
nose
but
did
reveal
slightly
more
spices
however
the
mouthfeel
was
exceedingly
thin
with
very
little
carbonation
weyerbacher
makes
some
good
beers
but
they
should
have
spent
more
time
at
the
drawing
board
with
this
one

for

the
problems
it
is
rather
drinkable
since
it
is
really
smooth
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
it
since
its
boring
but
i
could
see
how
others
would
mfd
nice
carbonation
light
in
body
long
lemony
spicy
finish
d
quite
drinkable
if
my
nose
and
palette
arent
wrong
the
blueberry
is
actually
a
subtle
but
very
nice
touch
a
wonderful
spring
or
summer
beer
which
i
would
gladly
revisit
in
the
future
hits
with
banana
and
a
bit
of
the
cream
taste
before
sliding
into
a
yeasty
somewhat
like
dry
blueberries
type
of
flavor
that
subtle
but
pleasant
the
taste
is
balanced
and
delicious
and
the
texture
is
good
if
not
a
little
watery
overall
a
pretty
damn
good
wit
seemingly
more
american
in
its
lighter
texture
and
flavor
it
was
a
very
well
priced
alternative
will
get
again
overall
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
weyerbacher
however
its
missing
a
crispness
to
really
set
it
apart
still
worth
a
shot
notes
a
good
summer
beer
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
for
3
50
wow
this
beer
sure
has
a
lot
of
blueberry
flavor
both
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
theres
a
little
vanilla
and
lavender
spice
behind
the
blueberry
but
this
beer
tastes
like
the
yeast
has
run
amuck
with
it
and
theres
almost
no
malt
to
be
found
still
the
body
is
light
and
the
beer
is
easy
drinking
assuming
you
like
blueberries
overall
im
extremely
satisfied
though
many
wits
taste
similar
this
one
is
just
done
well
i
would
choose
this
over
a
hoegaarden
and
likely
over
a
witte
from
ommegang
as
well
very
well
done
weyerbacher
this
is
nice
and
light
bodied
bubbly
and
smooth
a
great
american
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
summer
styles
md
it
is
very
light
and
smooth
i
goes
down
easy
but
if
it
could
loose
a
bit
of
the
grainy
edge
it
would
go
down
much
easier
probably
the
worst
weyerbacher
beer
i
have
had
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
the
style
and
is
more
in
the
league
of
macro
lagers
this
actually
reminded
me
of
a
watered
down
and
flat
festina
peche
i
am
a
big
fan
of
weyerbacher
and
belgian
wits
but
this
beer
just
doesnt
live
up
to
the
name
or
style
worth
a
try
but
dont
expect
to
be
impressed
it
is
a
very
light
wit
i
was
a
bit
thristy
and
had
to
resist
drinking
it
quickly
i
think
that
this
beer
will
share
some
appeal
between
craft
beer
drinkers
and
novices
to
a
certain
extent
a
good
wit
i
think
if
the
smell
and
body
were
a
bit
better
it
would
be
one
of
my
favs
i
like
hoegaarden
for
this
style
one
of
the
best
ive
had
the
wit
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
d
highly
drinkablei
put
this
one
down
in
just
a
few
gulps
a
great
springsummer
witbier
would
go
great
while
relaxing
on
a
patio
at
the
pool
or
on
the
beach
many
thanks
to
mikereaser
for
giving
me
the
chance
to
sample
this
beer
poured
up
a
very
light
cloudy
yellow
nearly
white
as
it
should
with
a
half
inch
fluffy
white
head
looks
nice
smell
is
somewhat
heavy
on
the
spice
more
so
than
probably
any
other
wit
i
have
had
taste
too
was
very
assertive
with
the
spice
a
characteristic
i
am
very
fond
of
indeed
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
making
this
a
very
refreshing
thirst
quenching
beer
i
must
admit
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
one
a
very
well
crafted
representation
of
one
of
my
favourite
warmweather
styles
nice
job
weyerbacher
di
probably
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
one
is
enough
very
drinkable
low
abv
good
summer
brew
easy
to
drink
not
a
true
wit
it
is
a
bit
lighter
mouthful
which
means
you
can
drink
a
whole
lot
of
these
and
i
want
to
as
far
as
drinkability
that
takes
a
hit
because
of
the
smell
i
get
a
big
nasty
whiff
every
time
i
take
a
sip
this
is
only
average
for
a
witbier
and
better
choices
abound
most
of
them
even
smell
nice
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
but
i
wont
go
looking
for
it
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
on
my
balcony
in
the
sun
today
but
nothing
really
stands
out
for
a
good
beer
but
fairly
average
a
great
domestic
interpretation
of
a
belgian
beer
a
great
crossover
beer
for
people
wanting
to
get
into
craft
and
belgian
beer
but
also
enough
going
on
for
people
with
exsperienced
pallets
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
very
cloudy
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
the
retention
of
the
skim
and
collar
were
good
and
the
lacing
average
the
aroma
was
classic
witbier
orange
coriander
wheat
well
blended
the
flavors
were
similar
starting
with
a
sweet
and
fruit
citrus
note
punctuated
by
the
coriander
and
nutmeg
this
sits
atop
some
pale
malt
backbone
all
with
a
breadlike
wheat
twang
at
the
end
medium
body
perfect
lively
carbonation
and
a
semicreamy
mouthfeel
that
does
leave
some
slickness
on
the
tongue
not
quite
as
good
as
hoegaarden
but
in
a
similar
category
and
better
than
for
example
blue
moon
drinkability
tastes
fine
albeit
deviating
from
a
wit
and
has
relatively
low
abv
light
and
crisp
refreshing
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
blanche
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
has
a
strong
citrus
component
and
some
clove
in
the
background
the
flavor
is
also
strongly
citrus
and
some
clove
at
the
end
surprisingly
good
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
drinkability
very
sessionable
yet
very
forgettable
a
great
spring
time
beer
maybe
thats
why
i
couldnt
get
into
it
as
much
due
it
to
being
october
and
starting
to
get
cold
not
bad
at
all
but
there
is
better
wits
out
there
to
choose
from
this
beer
is
by
no
means
bad
its
just
that
there
are
a
lot
better
examples
of
the
style
i
would
serve
to
people
over
this
one
its
just
too
spiced
this
wit
is
just
average
dont
think
i
would
actively
seek
out
again
d
lots
of
delicious
flavor
make
this
a
good
one
to
serve
up
in
warmer
weather
refreshing
and
not
over
the
top
easy
to
have
one
right
after
the
other
murky
yellow
color
and
pours
a
thick
white
head
that
fades
leaving
a
thin
layer
aroma
is
grass
malty
with
some
light
citrus
fruit
the
aroma
is
pretty
strong
but
i
wouldnt
say
i
liked
it
a
little
too
funky
its
a
pretty
good
tasting
wit
however
yeast
banana
coriander
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
but
really
not
a
whole
lot
of
that
theres
not
a
lot
to
it
but
i
was
looking
for
something
refreshing
to
drink
on
a
hot
florida
summer
day
and
this
does
just
fine
a
pretty
refreshing
brew
not
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
though
imo
not
bad
but
wouldnt
particularly
pick
out
this
over
others
of
the
style
md
pretty
smooth
and
easy
to
get
down
highly
carbonated
reminiscent
of
a
hoegarden
but
this
beats
the
hoe
not
that
i
codone
spousal
violence
decent
enough
brew
but
far
from
a
wit
body
medium
slick
and
very
quaffable
worth
seeking
for
the
witte
afficianado
d
very
drinkable
not
alot
of
alcohol
and
very
refreshing

on
a
hot

poured
a
clouded

that
had

has
spicy
yeast
some
funk
and
pepper

is
good
for
the

a
predominately
yeasty
flowery
punch
with
some

come
off

and
is
a

thin
but
a
decent
summertime
brew
drinkability
this
started
out
well
but
didnt
hold
up

i
like
this
one
slight
twist
on
a
witbier
recommend
d
a
really
refreshing
beer
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
probably
have
it
again
d
i
enjoy
many
different
alterations
of
witbiers
and
pale
wheat
ales
initial
tasting
of
this
beer
was
pleasent
but
the
sour
flavor
left
on
the
palate
made
it
not
as
enjoyable
started
fizzy
cloudy
yellow
head
that
went
away
fast
but
a
good
lace
around
the
rim
kept
alive
by
the
bubbles
and
particulate
at
the
bottom
a
slight
grapefruit
smell
liked
canned
grapefruit
juice
and
wheat
smell
mellowed
to
about
average
to
the
style
slight
sour
mouth
with
thin
creaminess
and
more
of
a
malt
aftertaste
than
a
juicy
fruit
remainder
bitter
on
the
starting
slug
then
candy
like
wheat
with
a
club
soda
texture
and
flavor
sort
of
like
a
gobstopper
just
sweet
well
if
you
want
a
wit
that
is
light
on
flavor
and
sweet
in
taste
this
one
would
be
decent
but
its
not
for
me
pours
a
nice
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
fades
to
lace
and
then
all
but
dissappears
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
a
nice
malty
wheat
citrus
which
leads
into
the
taste
but
the
taste
finishes
dry
and
spicey
a
nice
malty
mouthfeel
almost
overpowered
by
the
carbonation
a
good
drinkable
beer
thanks
again
weswes
after
having
their
alpha
this
is
far
inferior
blanche
started
off
nice
but
it
ended
on
a
sour
note
not
the
worst
witbier
out
there
but
its
clearly
not
the
best
one
either
this
is
one
witbier
that
can
be
missed
d
very
nice
summer
beer
solid
wheat
beer
but
a
little
light
on
the
flavor
goes
down
dry
leaves
me
thirsty
looking
for
the
garden
hose
mad
carbonation
in
the
eye
doesnt
feel
like
it
in
the
mouth
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
what
could
i
do
to
have
weyerbacher
start
shipping
to
minnesota
im
becoming
a
big
big
fan
overall
subdued
a
little
but
easily
drinkable
and
a
good
summer
beer
starchy
and
rather
dry
with
a
slight
acidic
bite
and
not
particularly
clean
in
the
finish
however
welcomed
consistent
with
the
style
and
well
crafted
another
quality
brew
from
the
fine
folks
at
weyerbacher
smooth
and
juicy
with
a
nice
bite
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
with
excellent
drinkability
drinkability
a
very
quenching
beer
with
enough
flavor
and
sugar
to
make
it
worthwhile
no
aftertaste
on
the
palate
clean
and
refreshing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
was
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
mediumsize
white
head
that
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
very
mild
citrus
aroma
lemon
and
orange
taste
faintly
tart
and
a
modicum
of
spice
i
thought
it
was
underwhelming
in
the
mouth
but
was
still
a
pleasant
enough
beer
d
overall
decent
but
doesnt
stand
out
drinkability
would
satisfy
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
nothing
else
d
very
drinkable
with
a
low
alcohol
level
that
makes
for
many
hours
of
easy
sipping
a
good
depiction
of
the
style
taste
is
crisp
bit
too
much
spice
though
something
i
normally
like
but
here
it
distracts
from
its
other
qualities
pretty
yeasty
with
a
citrus
edge
and
an
oddly
sour
finish
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
straw
no
head
i
took
a
whiff
of
this
one
right
after
pouring
and
i
got
peanut
butter
now
that
is
a
first
even
after
waiting
a
bit
i
still
get
peanut
butter
really
is
it
me
flavor
is
light
typical
wheat
characters
lemon
presence
is
fairly
strong
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
a
belgian
style
wheat
beer
as
it
is
an
american
one
i
dont
get
so
much
yeast
infusion
on
this
one
feel
is
what
you
would
expect
overall
very
drinkable
a
pretty
good
brew
just
doesnt
have
that
yeasty
funk
that
its
belgian
cousins
do
d
its
flavorful
but
not
t
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
good
representation
of
style
mild
kick
if
you
like
the
spice
content
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
personally
i
could
not
get
past
it
o
a
decent
witbier
that
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
the
best
offering
on
the
market
though
im
not
big
on
sweet
either
so
while
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
think
it
would
get
to
you
after
one
or
two
but
if
you
like
sweet
tea
or
really
sugary
lemonade
this
is
definitely
the
summer
thirst
quencher
for
you
d
i
could
probably
drink
two
of
these
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
but
im
definitely
enjoying
this
one
drinkability
unfortunately
this
isnt
one
of
weyerbachers
better
beers
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
with
no
freshness
dating
to
be
seen
on
the
bottle
the
label
stated
it
was
a
malt
beverage
brewed
with
spice
this
description
reminded
me
more
of
a
winter
warmer
than
a
summer
beer
it
poured
a
pretty
clear
pale
yellow
color
until
i
swished
the
bottle
and
added
the
left
over
yeast
and
sediment
in
the
bottom
it
turned
a
really
hazy
darker
golden
yellow
color
it
was
almost
white
when
i
held
it
to
the
light
the
fluffy
white
head
dissipated
rather
slowly
and
left
some
strong
lacing
in
the
pint
smell
was
rather
peanutty
at
first
mixed
with
a
dough
like
scent
hints
of
yeast
and
some
pale
malt
were
also
present
the
slight
esters
of
clove
and
some
lingering
banana
were
in
the
back
of
the
nose
the
first
taste
was
rather
chewy
and
dough
like
it
reminded
me
of
a
sugar
cookie
with
some
banana
in
the
after
taste
strong
presence
of
yeast
and
wheat
in
the
taste
mixed
with
some
spiced
tones
mouthfeel
was
rather
nice
not
over
carbonated
and
not
too
thin
it
did
prove
to
be
smooth
and
rather
easy
to
drink
it
is
a
decent
brew
but
i
have
had
a
bunch
of
wheat
beers
this
summer
and
this
one
was
not
on
my
favorite
list
it
is
a
style
of
beer
for
the
summer
and
may
appeal
to
other
peoples
tastes
but
it
was
not
really
too
appealing
to
mine
drinkability
is
of
this
beers
utmost
quality
i
can
drink
a
case
of
this
beer
and
i
just
have
to
give
some
props
to
one
of
my
new
favorite
breweries
wybach
in
the
house
d
the
smell
is
nice
but
overall
its
the
sourness
and
thinness
that
lost
it
for
me
its
got
a
silkiness
to
it
from
the
yeast
but
it
would
be
so
much
better
if
it
had
some
body
to
back
it
up
ive
had
weyerbachers
imperial
which
i
really
enjoyed
and
ive
heard
good
things
about
their
barley
wine
but
id
wouldnt
get
their
blanche
again
d
this
is
very
drinkable
and
another
great
release
from
weyerbacher
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
this
one
again
what
lacks
in
appearance
is
more
than
made
up
for
in
the
smell
taste
and
mouthfeel
very
sessionable
and
very
drinkable
brew
well
done
md
a
bit
sharp
not
too
smooth
but
a
decent
for
a
witbier
a
little
too
sweet
takes
the
edge
of
the
citrus
zest
overall
a
quality
witbier
that
goes
down
very
easily
definitely
best
when
its
super
fresh
and
consumed
on
a
warm
spring
evening
it
is
actually
better
than
i
remembered
and
will
likely
make
several
appearances
in
my
fridge
over
the
summer
12oz
brown
bottle
from
lighthouse
in
manchester
light
yellow
murky
body
with
a
good
inch
of
white
head
that
persists
well
and
leaves
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
smells
like
citrus
and
allspice
tastes
citrusy
pithy
and
spicy
with
notes
of
coriander
and
nutmeg
toward
the
finish
lighter
bodied
fairly
drinkable
this
is
a
pretty
good
witbier
the
appearance
was
nice
as
light
as
to
be
expected
a
nice
golden
yellow
clear
the
head
was
minimal
the
smell
was
light
but
sweet
and
had
some
hop
in
it
the
taste
was
light
with
a
clean
finish
as
to
be
expected
the
mouthfeel
had
significant
carbonation
and
went
down
very
easily
the
drinkability
was
nice
the
beer
was
lightesque
and
refreshing
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
poured
this
into
my
hoegaarden
glass
a
bit
light
on
the
color
almost
looked
like
sprite
the
aroma
was
citrus
and
coriander
with
a
slight
bit
of
clove
taste
was
much
the
same
except
there
was
more
coriander
almost
too
much
while
drinking
it
seemed
to
grow
on
me
but
its
not
something
id
actively
seek
pours
a
hazy
yellowgold
small
white
head
forms
settles
to
a
thin
layer
some
spots
of
lace
smell
is
sweet
orange
peels
and
citrus
spice
yeast
some
vanilla
little
bit
of
banana
taste
has
a
nice
malty
sweetness
citrus
spices
and
vanilla
acidity
in
the
finish
kind
of
sour
not
sure
if
intended
or
just
not
a
fresh
bottle
but
i
found
the
acidity
made
it
pretty
refreshing
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
pleasant
to
drink
da
this
is
hardly
worth
the
1
70
i
paid
for
it
12
ounce
bottle
smells
like
spice
and
citrus
fruits
but
not
much
comes
through
in
the
taste
though
there
is
a
crisp
spicy
finish
plenty
drinkable
though
an
average
wit
drinkability
is
good
this
brew
is
very
tasty
but
three
is
one
sitting
would
probably
be
the
limit
i
was
very
surprised
by
how
well
this
held
up
from
the
spring
the
5
00
abv
makes
this
a
great
session
beer
and
the
pepper
gives
it
just
a
bit
of
kick
to
separate
it
from
the
pack
of
hefes
and
witbiers
that
this
would
otherwise
get
easily
confused
with
this
was
a
great
brew
to
end
summer
on
and
a
good
style
to
for
weyerbacher
to
have
in
their
portfolio
prosit
d
a
solid
wit
its
next
to
impossible
to
drink
this
without
thinking
of
hoegaarden
drinkability
is
high
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
prosit
mk
light
body
high
carbonation
definitely
hits
the
spot
on
a
nice
cool
evening
of
porch
drinking
cheers
looks
cloudy
yellow
with
a
fading
white
head
smells
of
citrus
sulfur
it
seems
this
is
one
of
those
sulfur
wits
i
guess
it
is
to
someones
style
or
just
a
function
of
bad
yeast
management
the
flavor
is
not
so
sulfur
yeast
intensive
but
it
is
more
of
an
aftertaste
i
got
though
this
beer
but
was
glad
i
only
got
it
in
a
mix
six
pack
i
am
always
so
happy
with
the
weyerbacher
products
but
this
is
one
i
wont
try
again
for
a
while
id
recommend
this
for
its
interesting
texture
a
true
unfiltered
quality
im
tempted
to
throw
an
orange
slice
in
but
i
know
thats
a
no
no
the
carbonation
is
lively
but
not
that
which
is
typically
found
in
belgian
styles
weyerbacher
product
as
everything
else
ive
had
of
theirs
has
been
well
above
average
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
one
finger
plus
headwith
good
retention
and
lots
of
lace
aroma
is
yeasty
with
citrus
and
spice
body
is
medium
with
some
carbionation
taste
is
refreshing
smooth
with
yeast
up
front
and
a
nice
citrus
spice
finish
good
stuff
pours
a
very
light
slightly
cloudy
straw
with
a
large
white
head
with
moderate
lacing
smells
of
citrus
up
front
backed
by
yeast
with
a
hint
of
some
spice
overall
the
smell
was
overpowered
by
the
yeast
though
taste
was
dry
crisp
very
lightbodied
with
decent
carbonation
and
flavors
of
bread
lemon
zest
hint
of
lime
but
mostly
yeast
overall
this
beer
satisfied
me
but
the
ultra
light
body
seemed
to
let
the
beer
be
overpowered
by
breadiness
none
of
the
flavors
that
make
a
witbier
great
were
able
to
fully
come
out
a
decent
brew
but
have
had
better
of
the
style
the
yeast
in
this
beer
just
seems
a
bit
overpowering
which
hinders
this
brew
my
first
reaction
was
on
how
strong
the
flavor
was
however
that
was
mostly
head
acidic
and
somewhat
sour
but
in
a
good
way
it
has
promise
and
i
think
if
they
added
more
of
the
typical
witbier
charectoristics
theyd
have
a
winner
as
it
is
its
above
average
but
i
wouldnt
want
to
have
it
often
last
swigs
this
is
on
e
of
weyerbachers
best
brews
a
killer
version
of
a
wit
ive
picked
up
a
few
cases
of
this
and
used
it
as
a
conversion
beer
for
macro
friends
they
always
dig
it
taste
isnt
much
better
there
is
just
way
too
much
yeast
in
this
bad
boy
come
on
you
know
it
has
to
be
served
with
the
yeast
swirled
very
tart
puckering
and
sour
i
dont
like
it
not
one
bit
too
sour
with
nothing
to
balance
it
out
i
dont
hate
it
but
i
know
i
dont
like
it
as
much
as
any
other
wit
ive
had
blech
sour
easy
summer
brew
however
the
flavor
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
poured
a
cloudy
pale
yelloworange
color
with
moderate
white
puffy
head
that
fell
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
nice
and
spicy
with
corrainder
noted
taste
is
a
bit
dissapointing
with
an
oversweetness
prsent
that
proceeds
to
drown
out
all
the
other
tastes
its
almost
as
if
the
beer
had
been
diluted
with
lemonade
finish
is
pleasnt
enough
but
still
a
bit
too
sweet
ok
to
drink
but
one
is
definitely
enough
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
makes
for
great
summertime
drinking
it
is
also
an
excellent
crossover
beer
for
people
who
have
yet
to
realize
that
they
really
do
like
flavor
in
their
beer
my
speciallady
friend
is
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
and
this
style
in
general
basically
one
of
my
favorite
wits
is
blanche
de
chambly
and
im
looking
for
an
alternative
that
isnt
quite
so
pricey
this
is
not
that
beer
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
crisp
wheat
malt
scent
with
a
bit
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
its
fruity
with
a
dry
spiciness
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
and
refreshing
wheat
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
spicy
it
has
hints
of
clove
and
a
nice
yeast
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
drinkable
wit
i
like
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
its
true
to
style
but
nothing
over
the
top
a
very
pale
yellowalmost
straw
color
and
a
nice
white
head
best
describes
this
brew
head
fades
and
leaves
a
decent
never
ending
lace
till
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
has
a
lemon
zing
to
it
citrus
if
you
will
touch
of
fresh
cut
grass
is
noted
in
the
background
flavor
is
a
tart
start
with
the
citrus
rush
mild
yeast
flavors
and
then
a
mix
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
good
nothing
special
and
maybe
a
bit
watery
there
is
plenty
of
carbonation
going
on
a
good
brew
but
there
is
better
american
versions
of
this
style
out
there
note
i
feel
kind
of
bad
rating
it
this
low
because
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
although
i
didnt
rate
it
very
high
because
it
isnt
a
particularly
interesting
witbier
it
is
a
very
pleasing
and
ueberdrinkable
beer
its
characteristics
are
subtle
i
probably
would
buy
this
again
since
it
is
so
soothing
and
decently
priced
for
a
wheat
beer
over
weihenstephaner
it
is
worth
a
try
excellent
summer
beer
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
on
a
hot
summers
day
it
would
be
tough
to
beat
this
mouthfeel
was
pretty
good
id
go
back
for
this
one
drinkability
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
its
not
a
serious
contender
for
my
favorite
witbier
at
7
99
a
pack
i
could
be
persuaded
to
buy
it
again
but
i
might
just
go
with
something
different
instead
weyerbacher
has
not
scared
me
off
with
this
one
but
they
have
not
particularly
impressed
me
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
this
brew
is
a
milky
cloudy
straw
color
the
head
is
clingy
and
brilliantly
white
but
only
stands
about
threequarters
of
an
inch
the
appearance
isnt
particularly
notable
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
a
serious
citrus
characteristic
wheat
and
yeast
are
present
in
the
smell
but
not
much
spice
the
smell
also
has
a
distracting
musty
quality
coriander
does
make
an
appearance
in
the
taste
its
a
bit
grassy
and
theres
a
mouthpuckering
astringency
that
seemed
very
fitting
its
a
tangy
refreshing
brew
for
sure
of
course
so
are
a
lot
of
brews
and
this
one
isnt
really
a
stand
out
ill
start
by
saying
that
this
beer
is
drinkable
and
the
way
quenches
adds
to
that
quality
but
it
is
not
my
cup
of
wheat
the
citrus
and
spice
duo
spark
memories
of
lemon
pledge
in
my
mind
and
that
isnt
a
good
thing
for
me
but
if
others
dont
draw
that
comparison
then
it
wouldnt
be
an
issue
so
i
guess
im
trying
to
be
openminded
in
saying
that
while
its
not
my
favorite
it
could
be
because
im
a
freak
or
so
im
often
told
still
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
does
go
down
smoothly
and
i
would
have
another
if
it
was
put
in
front
of
me
gratis
i
will
not
drop
any
coin
on
anymore
myself
yes
im
a
bit
of
a
paradox
that
way
while
i
usually
like
belgian
wheats
i
will
have
to
pass
on
this
one
pours
a
pale
yellowcloudy
white
white
head
that
has
good
retention
and
leaves
a
nice
lacing
the
first
impression
when
you
smell
it
is
of
lemon
the
taste
starts
out
with
the
lemon
and
wheat
flavor
but
as
you
drink
more
the
spicey
flavors
start
to
become
more
noticable
and
really
stand
out
very
mild
hops
characteristics
not
many
bubbles
when
observing
the
beer
but
on
the
tongue
it
has
the
feal
of
a
highly
carbonated
brew
another
nice
beer
from
weyerbacher
that
i
would
recomend
weyerbacher
is
the
only
praised
micro
that
i
drink
where
every
other
beer
i
try
is
absolutely
terrible
and
the
good
ones
seem
to
be
the
higher
abv
will
be
sticking
to
those
in
the
future
unless
i
can
get
a
single
to
try
light
and
airy
on
the
palate
with
pretty
good
body
good
for
the
style
but
i
could
use
a
little
more
oomph
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
im
not
compeled
to
drink
anymore
thanks
to
blitheringidiot
for
the
opportunity
pale

thin
white
head
recedes
to
just
a
light
rimming
rather
quickly
fresh
scent
of
hay
ginger
dew
and
sweet
orange
pulp
the
taste
of
this
wit
really
has
some
snap
to
it
lemon
shavings
and
bitter
orange
crisp
maltiness
nutmeg
the
acidity
is
snappy
but
not

a
dry
finish
leaves
me
begging
for
more
nicely
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
a
body
checking
in
around
medium
approaching
mediumfull
nice
little
wit
a
12
finger
head
was
produced
as
this
beer
poured
out
a
sort
of
dusky
and
cloudy
yellow
color
the
immediate
smells
were
sour
and
spice
along
with
some
hints
of
apple
the
taste
was
sour
and
almost
metallic
this
yielded
to
fruit
with
a
hint
of
spice
in
the
mouth
this
beer
was
light
maybe
it
was
the
style
or
the
time
of
year
i
sampled
this
fall
but
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
too
light
a
beer
i
am
not
so
sure
id
seek
this
one
out
again
edit
tried
another
bottle
swiped
from
a
sixer
to
be
sure
thats
not
an
oldie
since
they
dont
date
their
bottles
and
am
sticking
to
my
original
review
note
the
label
states
that
this
is
a
malt
beverage
brewed
with
spices
what
a
strange
wit
pours
out
a
yellowgold
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
but
went
away
rather
quickly
smell
consisted
of
wheat
coriander
and
some
sweet
candylike
aromas
i
was
hoping
it
didnt
have
that
candylike
taste
but
it
did
sad
to
say
has
some
mouthplucking
lemon
taste
which
seems
to
get
worse
when
the
beer
warms
up
then
some
peppery
spicies
mix
in
to
somewhat
calm
the
lemon
taste
out
but
its
still
overwhelming
i
got
a
bunch
of
beers
from
this
brewery
i
hope
theyre
not
all
this
bad
pass
on
this
one
overall
i
tried
but
i
am
just
not
impressed
with
this
brew
to
me
it
tastes
alot
like
budweiser
which
isnt
to
say
bad
just
nothing
special
i
would
choose
the
bud
based
on
price
its
certainly
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
does
not
warrant
any
excitement
very
pale
yellow
and
cloudy
body
is
topped
by
a
smallish
chunky
white
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
bit
of
floral
orange
above
the
slightest
hint
of
banana
not
a
lot
of
clove
involved
in
this
thing
the
wheat
is
surprisingly
big
in
the
flavor
giving
off
the
essence
of
the
tought
crust
of
a
hunk
of
french
bread
esters
support
the
bready
malt
with
tartness
just
teasing
around
the
corner
very
light
and
easydrinking
and
very
refreshing
a
very
good
summer
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
the
8th
dominion
beerfest
looked
a
cloudy
lemonade
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
left
some
lace
around
the
sample
glass
aroma
consists
of
citrus
fruits
mainly
lemon
with
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
taste
starts
of
with
a
wheaty
malt
flavor
and
is
quickly
joined
by
orange
and
lemon
citrus
flavors
clean
dry
finish
with
a
little
spice
bite
to
it
and
a
lingering
lemon
flavor
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
and
goes
down
very
smooth
a
very
refreshing
drink
to
have
around
on
a
sunny
day
nice
and
refreshing
very
crisp
with
notes
of
banana
goes
down
easy
and
is
imo
one
of
the
better
whites
produced
in
the
usa
medium
bodied
good
for
a
hot
day
tried
this
beer
this
weekend
after
my
local
liquor
store
recommended
it
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
how
hazy
this
beer
was
it
pours
a
very
hazy
yellow
color
after
this
i
was
excited
to
try
this
brew
the
aroma
was
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
a
spice
smell
mixed
in
in
the
taste
there
was
a
definite
mix
of
orange
and
lemon
flavor
very
good
brew
but
i
have
had
better
wits
still
a
very
refreshing
good
brew
i
rated
the
drinkability
very
high
because
it
definitely
deserves
that
rating
a
sixer
of
this
seemed
to
just
disappear
goes
down
very
smooth
this
beer
poured
a
very

formed
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
quickly
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
clove
banana
and
citrus
are
present
with

a
flavor
of
clove

with
a
slight

it
a
slightly
tangy
grainy
finish
to
it

a
bad

i
enjoyed
this
refreshing

the
hazy

ale
boasted
a
sizeable
and
lacy
head
considering
that
it
was
served
from
the
cask
it
had
a
coriander
lemon
scent
and
a
flavor
that
built
upon
those
notes
combining
them
with
some
dry
grassy
notes
and
an
underlying
sweetness
it
was
a
refreshing

drinkable

banana
just
a
hint
of
spice
noticeable
in
the
nose
body
is
quite
light
carbonated
perfectly
as
well
taste
is
dusted
with
wheat
and
malt
and
seasonesd
with
just
a
bit
of
lemon
and
very
subtle
hop
flavor
spicing
of
this
wit
is
very
nicely
done
with
clove
and
coriander
noticeable
without
taking
over
finish
is
clean
a
bit
on
the
dry
side
but
very
refreshing
very
drinkable
stuff
the
blanche
is
its
very
hazy
yellow
body
is
topped
by
a
creamy
brightwhite
head
that
holds
fairly
well
before
dropping
to
a
decent
collar
and
leaves
some
thin
splashy
lace
about
the
glass
the
aroma
is
delicately
sweet
and
citrusy
orange
and
lemon
rind
slightly
earthy
and
gently
cloveish
the
body
is
light
but
with
a
fine
natural
carbonation
that
leaves
just
a
mild
effervescence
on
the
tongue
before
it
warms
to
become
smooth
across
the
palate
the
flavor
offers
very
lightly
tangy
notes
of
orange
peel
and
malt
along
with
a
sprinkling
of
delicate
clovelike
spiciness
and
a
wash
of
yeastiness
the
finish
is
short
and
lightly
sweet
balanced
by
its
lingering
drying
cloves
exquisitely
balanced
refreshing
and
enjoyable
through
several
servings
hazy
pale
yellow
capped
by
a
creamy
white
head
coriander
sour
malted
wheat
and
bitter
orange
in
the
nose
nicely
spiced
this
example
of
the
style
lets
the
nonspice
additions
steer
the
ship
both
spices
are
evident
yet
neither
is
overpowering
coriander
lends
a
herbed
bread
crust
flavor
that
is
in
accord
with
the
malt
creamy
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
the
finish
snappy
with
a
little
tartness
bitterness
and
husk
nicely
done
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
domestic
renditions
of
the
style
beautifully
cloudy
gold
with
a
fine
lace
a
classic
blanche
in
appearance
the
smell
of
fruit
rolls
off
this
one
grapes
apples
citrus
nicely
sour
with
a
bouquet
of
citrus
and
apples
in
the
finsh
a
smooth
and
oily
feel
with
a
bit
of
effervesence
a
good
domestic
attempt
at
a
belgian
blanche
it
misses
a
bit
of
the
yeast
taste
that
you
would
find
in
hoegardden
or
blanche
dbruges
its
not
going
to
move
me
away
from
the
imports
but
would
definately
provide
an
option
if
they
werent
available
wow
this
is
a
very
sweet
beer
it
has
all
the
characteristics
of
other
beers
but
is
is
a
very
light
sweet
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
medium
head
and
little
lace
it
has
a
ight
mouthfeel
as
well
as
for
taste
there
is
some
hop
flavor
but
it
being
a
wheat
beer
there
is
a
solid
malt
presence
and
a
light
citrus
taste
while
it
pours
with
some
spices
and
some
variances
the
sweet
bananna
and
clove
mix
is
the
prolific
taste
going
on
and
it
definately
to
me
tasted
as
if
it
had
apricot
hints
so
so
sweet
is
this
brew
you
will
hardly
think
about
the
hops
at
all
which
may
be
its
main
problem
it
almost
seems
toooo
sweet
at
eams
with
an
almost
apricot
wheat
flavor
to
it
pours
a
nice
hazy
golden
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
sticks
around
but
laces
little
aroma
is
spicy
grassy
think
hayfield
and
some
lemon
flavor
is
citric
spicy
fairly
acidic
and
ends
very
dry
body
is
medium
a
pretty
refreshing
brew
went
down
nice
and
smooth
over
the
past
summer
ive
not
always
been
impressed
with
weyerbachers
beers
but
this
is
a
good
one
quite
tasty
and
ill
probably
have
one
again
pours
out
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
which
fades
quickly
smells
very
spicy
with
some
bannana
and
clove
too
much
like
a
german
hefe
tastes
very
interesting
cloves
bannanas
corriander
maybe
some
vanilla
are
all
there
with
very
little
hop
presence
overall
i
liked
it
but
it
was
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
session
with
it
well
worth
trying
for
its
unique
flavor
dont
think
i
would
want
another
but
it
is
tasty
appears
hazed
golden
yellow
with
a
vibrant
highly
carbonated
white
head
leaving
nice
even
patches
of
lacing
even
though
the
head
was
so
short
stayed
aroma
contains
a
banana
bread
tone
to
it
with
some
vanilla
highlights
working
their
magic
here
and
a
mild
butterscotch
tone
to
it
flavor
is
deeply
acidic
with
a
citruswheat
shap
tone
slicing
across
my
palate
not
as
smooth
as
a
typical
witbier
but
the
flavor
mellows
and
rolls
into
a
spiced
up
banana
flavor
altogether
not
the
best
selling
point
of
the
bier
mouthfeel
great
texture
slightly
syrupy
but
high
carbonation
makes
for
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
and
medium
body
great
sensations
across
the
board
here
drinkability
is
solid
not
on
the
high
end
but
a
decent
witbier
more
flavorful
but
he
bready
characteristic
that
the
yeast
sports
turns
me
off
and
is
a
bit
cloying
on
the
overall
drinkability
level
good
beer
a
case
of
this
is
my
daytoday
entertaining
guests
beer
always
impressed
people
especially
those
who
arent
fans
of
beer
give
it
a
try
this
is
a
very
well
done
white
beer
and
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
i
was
excited
when
i
saw
this
one
not
many
american
breweries
are
massproducing
wit
beers
needless
to
say
i
was
rather
disappointed
with
this
one
the
subtle
spicey
citrusy
flavor
which
enjoy
about
this
style
just
wasnt
there
i
hate
coming
off
like
a
style
maven
but
as
far
as
style
goes
it
misses
wit
by
just
a
bit
all
of
the
wits
that
i
have
had
are
wits
in
their
own
ways
yet
they
all
have
some
kind
of
citrus
spice
combination
that
makes
this
style
so
quaffable
to
my
palate
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
that
needs
to
adjust
the
spice
a
bit
full
white
head
but
it
fades
very
quickly
a
little
lingers
pleasant
looking
beer
light
gowing
yellow
beer
fantastic
aroma
slightly
sweet
wheaty
chunky
mouthfeel
tastes
nice
blandly
robust
if
you
know
what
i
mean
light
and
clean
so
its
drinkable
a
decent
white
but
not
the
best
tried
a
bottle
of
this
local
brew
recently
and
found
myself
somewhat
disappointed
now
this
is
partially
my
fault
since
i
disturbed
the
sediment
but
i
was
very
turned
off
by
the
overwhelming
yeast
taste
of
the
beer
it
pours
a
beautiful
hazy
goldenyellow
with
a
good
one
inch
head
that
dissapates
moderately
slight
lacing
around
the
glass
spice
flavors
of
corrinander
and
perhaps
nutmeg
are
present
as
well
as
the
citrus
notes
of
banana
and
orange
nice
motuhfeel
closer
to
the
real
belgain
wits
than
most
u
s
micros
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
or
pour
with
less
disturbance
but
overall
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
white
hazy
gold
body
with
stray
bubble
trails
thin
rapidly
decaying
white
head
very
spicy
nose
banana
orange
lemon
little
pepper
taste
is
light
very
refreshing
spices
accent
but
do
not
dominate
slides
gently
across
the
tongue
with
a
proper
level
of
carbonation
a
good
choice
for
a
hot
summer
day
better
than
anticipated
shame
about
that
head
though
for
a
belgian
this
did
not
have
a
big
head
or
any
head
really
to
speak
of
just
some
errant
bubbles
floating
atop
a
cloudy
straw
body
the
smell
is
what
always
gets
me
about
a
wit
it
just
smells
nasty
to
me
there
is
way
too
much
corny
uncooked
wheat
undertow
to
it
i
love
hefe
beers
but
wits
just
dont
do
it
for
me
the
taste
was
better
with
some
refreshing
lemon
flavors
and
a
nice
bready
taste
from
the
yeast
but
that
horrible
burnt
corn
taste
lingered
in
the
aftertaste
there
was
also
a
fair
bit
of
peanutty
taste
as
well
which
seemed
somewhat
out
place
for
a
beer
the
mouthfeel
was
easy
going
and
not
overly
carbonated
with
bubbles
tickling
the
tongue
although
i
do
not
like
wits
and
probably
never
will
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
none
the
less
which
gives
it
somewhat
increased
scores
for
drinkability
served
a
hazy
lemon
color
topped
by
a
white
lasting
head
the
aroma
is
coriander
and
wheat
very
fresh
and
inviting
theres
a
nice
lemon
note
in
the
taste
with
a
touch
of
cloves
strong
coriander
and
a
distinct
yeast
taste
it
also
seems
very
malty
especially
for
a
wit
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
very
full
it
is
very
well
rounded
and
has
a
nice
finebubbled
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
as
this
is
both
refreshing
and
satisfying
f
this
beer
was
my
first
choice
when
i
got
my
new
miester
it
is
excellant
smooth
great
taste
with
a
slight
spice
at
the
end
very
clean
it
has
hints
of
fruit
on
the
nose
it
has
a
nice
head
when
it
comes
from
the
tap
and
leaves
a
beautiful
lace
on
the
glass
i
would
absolutley
get
it
again
and
let
others
know
of
it
refreshing
and
great
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
good
sized
white
head
that
faded
too
quickly
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
seemed
to
need
a
bit
too
much
agitation
to
get
up
into
the
beer
i
dont
think
that
this
is
going
to
be
and
old
bottle
though
since
weyerbacher
just
started
distribution
to
va
smell
is
nicely
fruity
with
just
enough
spicy
corianderpepper
in
it
the
taste
starts
off
with
creamy
yeast
flavors
before
fading
into
subtle
orange
flavors
with
some
nice
mellow
spices
good
full
mouthfeel
is
imparted
by
the
yeast
and
the
brew
has
the
perfect
body
this
is
one
very
drinkable
wit
i
am
going
to
have
to
try
some
more
brews
from
this
brewery
to
figure
out
just
how
good
they
are
so
far
my
experience
has
been
spotty
with
them
beautiful
yellowgold
color
with
a
snowy
white
head
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
deadon
a
near
perfect
balance
of
orange
coriander
yeast
maltwheat
the
flavors
just
flow
though
the
mouth
from
sip
to
swallow
i
cant
tell
you
what
it
tastes
like
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
because
it
didnt
last
long
enough
to
get
warm
outstanding
for
its
style
and
a
beer
i
hope
to
be
quaffing
all
summer
long
good
not
as
interesting
as
ommegangs
other
beers
great
warm
weather
beer
light
with
good
spice
tones
light
hazy
yellow
with
big
white
head
that
didnt
stay
long
but
draped
some
lace
on
the
glass
all
the
way
down
wheat
and
yeast
competeing
for
the
lead
in
aroma
with
orange
peel
and
spices
in
a
back
up
role
bready
taste
with
some
tartness
very
dry
and
refreshing
another
great
one
from
ommegang
good
wheat
very
drinkable
and
tasty
a
traditional
belgium
witte
beer
but
its
not
quite
belgium
enough
for
me
a
very
good
recipe
though
good
job
cooperstown
im
a
total
ommegang
honk
and
love
everything
they
make
they
are
the
kings
of
taking
on
the
belgian
style
in
the
us
this
is
a
great
golden
filtered
wheat

like
the
feel
of
this
beer
it
has
a
lot
of
flavors
without
killing
your
pallet
seems
to
hit
the
back
of
the
tongue
with
a
tingling
sensation
i
taste
a
small
amount
of
sulfur
and
some
alcohol
but
both
are
matched
well
with
the
other
flavors
present
i
was
very
surprised
after
pouring
to
see
that
the
beer
was
as
clear
as
crystal

i

changed
my

the

the
proper

me
to

i
had
not
before
noticed
there
was
a

this
is
definitely
not
a
favourite
in
the
style
but
fairly
drinkable
it
was
my
last
of
a
sixpack
so
it
may
not
have
been
superfresh
either
although
it
was
well
before
the
expiry
date
on
the
label
drinkability
not
the
best
offering
from
ommegang
but
at
least
it
was
an
above
average
witbier
from
an
excellent
brewery
its
no
hennepin
but
hey
what
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
nothing
great
about
it
nothing
offensive
this
is
the
first
ommegang
product
i
havent
been
overly
impressed
with
though
not
much
lacing
weak
body
decent
taste
but
falls
a
little
short
of
what
i
expect
from
a
white
beer
definitely
worth
a
try
dont
get
me
wrong
just
not
one
of
my
favorites
i
had
4
good

then
poured
the

hoegaardens
true

serve
this
wherever
and
whenever
champagne
is
called
for
the
cage
and
cork
and
the
very
winey
taste
and
appearance
make
this
a
great
beer

it

nothing
exciting

a

but
okay
pretty
drinkable
light
and
easy
not
my
favorite
ommegang
brew
not
even
my
second
or
third
favorite
but
not
shabby
drinkability
was
above
average
but
this
seemed
to
be
a
very
pedestrian
effort
by
the
folks
at
ommegang
great
brewery
but
this
one
was
disappointing
at
best
kind
of
hohum
ive
enjoyed
other
offerings
from
ommegang
much
more
this
was
a
cloudy
yellow
appearance
with
a
small
head
and
some
lacing
it
had
an
orange
spicy
grainy
odor
to
it
the
taste
was
pretty
much
orange
and
spice
fairly
mild
it
was
ok
a
little
pedestrian
not
something
id
drink
a
lot
of
this
pours
a
yellow
straw
with
a
large
foamy
head
this
beer
has
a
ton
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
on
the
light
side
with
some
lemon
and
wheat
scents
the
taste
has
a
strong
lemon
flavor
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
coriander
the
mf
is
lightbut
has
a
blance
of
flavors
that
isnt
quite
right
this
is
an
ok
witte
beer
but
if
i
had
to
pick
just
oneit
wouldnt
be
this
an
excellent
springtime
beer
as
good
for
sipping
as
it
is
for
pounding
ommegang
witte
will
do
in
a
pinch
if
the
only
other
options
are
macros
i
kinda
hope
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
i
suspect
not
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
in
the
wit
style
not
to
say
its
bad
though
its
okay
im
not
sure
if
id
recommend
to
someone
looking
for
wits
though
flavor
is
light
and
almost
delicate
very
nice
in
the
mouth
im
starting
to
recognize
the
coriander
among
a
few
different
spices
and
a
pleasant
citrus
as
well
plenty
of
lacing
all
over
the
exposed
glass
this
is
top
notch
stuff
as
far
as
a
white
ale
similar
to
hoegaarden
but
maybe
superior
on
the
mouthfeel
as
far
as
a
springsummer
style
beer
this
would
be
tough
to
beat
the
mouth
is
crisp
yet
silky
smooth
easy
drinker
this
would
move
up
the
scales
with
a
bit
more
oomph
inspite
of
these
minor
flaws
i
enjoy
this
beer
spritzy
mouthfeel
that
enjoys
the
steady
carbonation
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
has
all
of
the
refreshing
qualities
of
a
good
witte
and
the
usual
depth
that
i
expect
from
ommegang
makes
for
a
solid
beer
very
very
average
whitbier
im
glad
i
got
to
try
it
thanks
to
fuzzyknoggin
but
theres
a
rather
large
list
of
whitbiers
i
would
purchase
drink
before
this
one
poured
into
my
faithful
westmalle
chalice
as
a
relatively
clear
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
whiter
than
white
head
dissipated
rather
quickly
but
can
be
easily
revived
little
lacing
in
the
glass
nose
is
slightly
spicy
yeasty
and
has
that
signature
touch
of
citrus
appeal
smell
is
not
as
assertive
as
id
have
liked
taste
is
dry
accentuated
with
a
good
spicy
and
fruity
character
tastes
of
pepper
and
pears
this
witte
is
light
in
body
and
very
highly
carbonated
creating
a
pleasant
tingle
almost
like
a
carbonated
soft
drink
this
is
a

witte
ommegangs
other
ales
are
better
i
think

this

the

is

but
above

thanks
to
faustgeist
for
sharing
my
least
favorite
ommegang
beer
lucky
since
i
cant
buy
it
easily
im
pretty
disappointed
with
this
just
not
much
happening
in
the
glass
i
really
love
everything
ommegang
does
think
its
all
exceptional
always
have
some
in
the
fridge
but
this
i
wouldnt
buy
again
the
beers
tartness
made
itself
more
and
more
apparent
as
it
warmed
in
my
glass
this
has
a
slighly
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
but
the
bright
white
head
had
no
retention
the
smell
is
mainly
yeast
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
nice
with
oragnepeel
blending
seamlessly
with
the
hops
a
bit
of
herby
corriander
to
blend
with
the
malt
and
plenty
of
yeast
to
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
off
with
teeny
tiny
sharp
bubbles
overall
this
was
enjoyable
but
ever
so
slighly
flawed
for
the
style
the
flavors
were
well
rounded
but
it
seems
as
though
some
details
were
missed
this
beer
is
a
fine
example
of
the
witbier
style
it
smells
heavenly
and
tastes
almost
as
good
even
though
i
still
prefer
the
masterpiece
that
is
allagash
white
i
have
to
agree
with
the
label
that
ommegang
witte
is
worth
the
wheat
overall
an
interesting
wit
plenty
of
tartness
and
spice
in
flavor
solid
nothing
special
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
very
light
bodied
and
more
than
ample
carbonation
very
tart
but
this
just
help
render
a
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
spritzy
and
smooth
slightly
creamy
this
one
goes
down
easily
and
would
make
for
a
great
summer
beach
brew
bring
a
few
750s
and
enjoy
the
sun
not
my
favorite
from
ommegang
but
a
nice
wit
overall
all
in
all
a
stand
out
will
happily
drink

the
flavor

slightly

cheers
pours
an
extremely
light
golden
color

is
paler
on
the
sides
than
in
the
center
almost
whitish
after
a
careful
pour
out
of
a
750ml
the
beer
is
transparent
and
clear
a
two
inch
white

forms
comprised
of
very
loose
bubbles
the
aroma
is
fairly
strong
but
not
terribly
complex
tangy
wheatlike
witha
bit
of
orange
peel
in
the
background
thankfully
the
taste
is
more
interesting
than
the
aroma
it
begins
with
a
slight
orangey
sweetness
this
quickly
gives
way
to
a
wheaty
tang
and
a
belgian
spiciness
that
twirl
around
each
other
add
some
coriander
at
the
end
for
good
measure
there
is
a
bitterness
from
the
orange
peel
that
sits
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
after
the
swallow
this
is
an
immensely
drinkable
beer
which
is
very
quenching
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
but
feel
it
could
be
even
better
with
a
little
more
orange
sweetness
and
a
little
less
wheaty
tang
dont
serve
it
too
cold
as
the
flavors
are
very
muted
when
cold
overall
the
acidity
prevails
with
the
spices
of
yeast
gaining
precedence
over
classic
powdery
textures
and
prominant
spice
additions
this
gives
a
rustic
unveiled
character
that
is
likely
more
like
what
authentic
witbiers
used
to
be
overall
this
is
a
great
wit
a
quality
body
with
pretty
good
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
smoothness
that
other
wit
dont
have
drinkability
refreshingly
light
but
not
a
spicy
as
i
was
expecting
d
this
is
definatly
a
hot
weather
biere
i
drank
mine
with
a
brats
w
sourkraut
it
went
down
well
and
didnt
over
power
the
tangy
kraut
taste
you
could
match
this
up
with
any
good
bbq
food
and
it
would
work
well
also
since
the
low
alcohol
level
you
could
put
away
a
few
in
a
sitting
and
their
not
filling
either
although
this
is
not
my
favorite
wit
out
there
by
any
means
it
still
stands
up
as
an
above
scale
example
of
the
style
but
if
you
like
wits
try
the
celis
or
and
easy
classic
the
hoegarden
well
when
poured
there
is
a
large
bubbly
head
and
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
color
the
head
will
lessen
the
smell
is
of
yeast
and
a
hint
of
citrus
and
spice
the
taste
is
of
light
citrus
and
spice
yet
is
kind
of
dull
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
tingle
the
drinkablility
is
average
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
big
frothy
head
good
longevity
and
equally
good
lace
smells
just
like
a
witte
should
a
sour
malted
wheat
aroma
with
banana
clove
and
citrus
tones
as
far
as
taste
it
also
tastes
as
a
witte
should
but
nothing
too
spectacular
it
has
the
all
the
standard
wheat
flavors
banana
clove
citrus
etc
fairly
high
carbonation
i
realize
witts
do
tend
to
have
higher
than
average
but
this
left
me
a
bit
bloated
and
belchy
if
thats
a
word
than
normal
it
is
easy
drinking
but
a
bit
too
high
on
the
carbonation
side
still
an
very
good
beer
though
its
light
very
light
with
moderate
carbonation
this
makes
it
very
drinkable
i
finished
half
of
a
750
bottle
in
just
minutes
this
surprised
me
because
i
was
used
to
ommegangs
heavier
beers
it
felt
a
little
too
filter
for
my
taste
other
wise
this
was
a
nice
beer
as
this
is
a
750ml
bottle
if
youre
not
splitting
it
with
a
friend
it
releases
more
flavor
as
it
reaches
room
temp
that
overthe
top
co2
bitterness
gives
way
and
it
becomes
a
lot
smoother
and
more
enjoyable
i
like
this
more
than
other
witbeirs
ive
tried
pours
a
dullish
cloudy
yellow
with
a
decent
foamy
white
head
smells
of
wheat
go
figure
a
little
spicy
fruity
with
a
bit
of
a
musty
finish
taste
is
similarly
grainy
spicy
citrusy
and
musty
not
too
malty
or
hoppy
really
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
refreshing
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
this
beer
it
was
refreshing
to
drink
but
didnt
really
have
too
much
character
not
bad
not
great
but
pretty
good
i
like
the
complexity
of
their
other
brews
over
this
witbier
despite
its
carbonation
it
does
go
down
easy
i
could
drink
one
of
these
after
the
other
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
and
very
flavorful
beer
one
that
should
be
visited
on
a
warm
summer
day
to
truly
appreciate
its
refreshing
nature
this
is
a
very
pretty
beer
that
almost
shines
in
the
light
the
nose
is
clean
and
crisp
with
those
traces
of
orange
and
coriander
what
i
really
noticed
about
this
version
was
the
sophistication
and
care
taken
with
the
balance
and
finish
fragrant
oh
so
drinkable
and
very
well
crafted
pours
a
nice
hazy
pale
golden
hue
with
pillowy
white
head
that
fades
fast
very
little
lacing
smells
of
powdery
yeasts
with
some
citrus
tastes
of
citrus
bitterness
that
curiously
fades
almost
immediately
leaving
lingering
citrous
light
to
body
with
nice
effervescence
this
is
a
very
light
and
refreshing
brew
a
full
bodied
version
is
necessary
the
average
alcohol
content
and
its
light
taste
makes
this
a
drinkable
beer
its
nice
for
the
warmer
months
which
are
many
down
here
in
florida
another
solid
offering
from
ommegang
entry
lights
softly
on
the
palate
moving
headlong
into
a
midtaste
featuring
beautiful
light
grapefruit
and
orange
notes
supported
by
ample
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
with
many
floral
notes
and
a
belgian
yeast
fade
drinkability
very
good
summer
witbier
not
the
best
but
one
of
the
good
ones
to
be
sure
sampled
as
i
type
june

2005
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
a
big
white
head
head
disipates
semiquickly
and
lace
starts
to
fom
nice
carbonation
is
full
in
the
glass
and
the
beer
dances
on
the
tonque
nose
shows
big
citrus
and
some
clove
definately
yeast
dominated
the
mouthfeel
as
i
said
is
effervescent
nice
and
refreshing
the
flavor
is
tart
grapefruit
maybe
finish
is
long
and
dry
leaves
you
mouth
watering
drinkable
however
not
my
type
of
wight
beer
nicely
done
by
ommegang
pours
a
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
spongey
head
nice
spiral
of
carbonation
comes
out
of
the
center
of
the
goblet
aroma
is
oranges
wheat
and
yeast
taste
is
nice
and
chewy
wheat
comes
across
at
first
followed
up
by
a
nice
citurus
birts
of
oranges
and
lemons
mouthfeel
is
very
full
and
chewy
i
like
that
word
finish
is
just
slightly
dry
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
without
a
high
abv
that
makes
a
nice
sessional
choice
taste
lick
an
orange
rind
lick
a
cut
granny
smith
crack
a
white
peppercorn
and
blow
it
across
your
palate
drink
some
artesian
water
with
a
lemon
squirt
look
at
the
word
coriander
lick
that
apple
again
and
again
dries
dries
to
a
mouthful
of
white
wheat
flour
i
couldnt
drink
this
fast
enough
partly
because
its
quenching
and
partly
because
its
boring
for
my
money
id
buy
a
case
of
berliner
kindl
recently
reviewed
cork
pops
with
all
of
the
beer
staying
in
the
bottle
pours
extremely
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
lot
of
chill
haze
very
watery
with
an
overriding
grassy
flavor
mouthfeel
is
very
light
as
to
be
expected
in
the
style
slighty
acidic
and
citrusy
taste
but
not
overwhelming
orange
flavor
like
other
wittes
no
corriander
flavor
like
other
wittes
either
slight
yeasty
background
taste
flavor
quickly
dissipates
with
not
much
aftertaste
other
than
a
crisp
watery
flavor
refreshing
but
not
much
there
fairly
dry
in
aftertaste
an
average
interpretation
of
a
witbier
i
think
im
a
little
disappointed
in
ommegang
for
this
one
because
all
their
other
beers
are
stellar
this
however
is
pretty
plain
its
still
a
good
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
could
be
better
bottle
poured
a
pale
clear
yellow
color
ale
with
below
average
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
orange
and
very
subtle
coriander
taste
is
very
light
with
limited
spice
lack
of
coriander
with
some
limited
sweetnessfloral
aspect
carbonation
is
good
but
body
is
too
thin
watery
feeling
on
the
aftertaste
kind
of
ruin
this
one
for
me
to
be
fair
i
will
seek
this
out
and
review
it
again
im
sure
it
is
more
tasty
and
pleasant
to
drink
when
fresh
mouthfeel
is
light
and
spritzy
yet
absolutely
full
of
flavor
a
smooth
almost
creamy
body
with
gentle
rolling
medium
bubbles
this
tastes
sooo
good
on
a
hot
afternoon
i
could
drink
all
6
hats
off
to
you
again
ommegang
you
couldnt
find
a
better
belgian
witte
in
all
of
belgium
taste
has
a
permeating
barnyard
funk
sour
wheat
malt
and
spicy
coriander
and
lemony
a
bit
thin
but
crisp
and
dry
nice
clean
finish
with
a
faint
funky
aftertaste
no
the
best
but
a
really
good
witte
this
beer
poured
a
very
murky
yellow
color
and
formed
a
small
egg
white
bubbly
head
that
left
trace
lace
as
it
subsided
some
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
hops
citrus
and
some
small
hint
of
spices
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
citrus
the
finish
was
a
touch
dry
a
refreshing
belgian
wit
style
but
strikes
me
more
of
a
session
type
rather
than
the
higher
tier
types
drinkability
is
decent
with
this
beers
only
drawback
being
its
slightly
below
average
mouthfeel
still
tasted
good
and
the
whole
750
went
down
pretty
quick
not
to
bad
ommegang
the
beer
divorces
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
and
sets
in
the
glass
a
beclouded
lemon
yellow
with
a
modest
creamy
white
head
and
the
residual
lace
a
velum
like
sheet
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
with
malt
hints
of
lemonlime
coriander
and
spices
the
start
is
lightly
sweet
and
the
top
is
light
in
feel
upon
the
palate
finish
is
stinging
in
its
acidity
with
the
hops
delectable
in
their
unassuming
spiciness
quite
dry
aftertaste
a
fine
example
of
the
style
quite
a
thirst
quencher
comments
this
beer
is
brewed
in
new
york
but
it
tastes
just
like
any
one
of
several
beers
from
beligium
that
i
have
tried
recommended
very
mild
very
dry
but
leaves
this
oddly
enjoyable
oily
feel
on
the
tongue
the
label
says
it
combines
flavors
of
sweet
orange
peel
coriander
and
unmalted
wheat
that
sums
it
up
pretty
well
in
my
view
a
very
pleasant
drinking
experience
and
another
fine
offering
from
the
folks
at
ommegang
i
applaud
ommegang
one
of
my
favorite
american
breweries
for
crafting
this
nearly
note
perfect
rendition
of
a
delicious
refreshing
belgian
style
taste
dry
with
a
crisp
and
spiced
body
some
citrus
notes
feels
slightly
thin
in
the
mouth
this
would
be
a
pretty
good
session
beer
in
the
summer
but
overall
i
prefer
the
allagash
white
unibroue
blanche
de
chambly
or
hoegaarden
wit
their
packaging
rocks
also
i
give
it
low
drinkability
because
as
good
as
it
is
i
dont
see
drinking
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
but
i
will
order
again
on
occasion
hazy
sunnywheat
colored
beer
with
streams
of
small
bubbles
poured
a
big
bright
white
meringue
looking
head
that
looked
good
at
first
but
didnt
last
all
that
long
and
left
no
lace
light
wheat
aroma
with
some
zesty
lemon
and
corriander
mixed
in
and
a
pinch
of
yeast
at
the
bottom
fairly
light
easy
drinking
beer
light
wheatmalt
base
with
some
notquite
sour
lemon
and
coriander
towards
the
end
light
without
being
water
taste
is
simple
and
enjoyable
very
refreshing
gimme
more
lightly
hazy
im
alarmed
at
the
clarity
and
the
lack
of
color
faint
gold
in
hue
no
depth
the
head
was
about
a
finger
in
height
white
in
color
bubbly
and
then
fizzy
head
retention
was
soso
it
faded
to
a
thin
fizzy
cap
a
few
moments
later
nothing
was
left
i
am
not
impressed
with
the
appearance
of
this
beer
hell
it
looks
no
better
than
new
belgiums
sunshine
wheat
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
either
dull
the
nose
lacked
potency
i
could
hardly
smell
anything
what
the
hell
faint
notes
of
citrus
spiced
wheat
malt
mild
dough
kisses
flour
some
pepper
too
the
detectable
aromas
are
pleasant
and
generally
witlike
too
clean
for
me
im
not
impressed
with
the
nose
soft
middling
inviting
by
default
barely
the
palate
is
surprisingly
tart
for
a
wit
its
not
right
i
like
my
wits
with
a
healthy
wheatyyeastychalky
flavor
in
the
middle
this
one
has
nothing
like
that
nothing
the
wheat
offers
hardly
anything
ive
tasted
more
wheat
in
adjunct
lagers
the
spices
are
hardly
noticed
as
well
again
what
the
hell
pepper
is
stronger
in
taste
then
the
coriander
tart
lemon
is
stronger
in
taste
then
the
orange
peel
this
beer
is
way
out
of
whack
juicy
finish
it
is
too
wet
no
dryness
no
spice
in
the
aftertaste
i
am
not
impressed
at
all
with
this
wit
it
is
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
ommegang
brewed
this
mediumlight
in
body
slick
mouthfeel
because
the
body
is
thin
and
a
bit
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
lacking
more
effervesces
is
needed
tacky
sure
it
is
drinkable
but
it
is
completely
pointless
this
is
one
of
the
worst
wits
ive
ever
tasted
it
is
inoffensive
but
horribly
boring
i
have
no
reason
to
drink
this
overly
tart
underspiced
nonwheaty
clean
white
ale
again
this
is
a
very
sad
example
of
the
style
a
major
dud
not
recommended
i
purchased
a
750ml
in
milwaukee
wi
for
4
00
pours
a
hazy
yellowstraw
color
and
is
topped
by
an
eminent
frothy
pale
white
head
that
is
initially
held
up
by
a
healthy
carbonation
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
freshly
cut
hay
fields
of
clover
coriander
lemon
zest
and
grains
of
paradise
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
with
notes
of
orange
zest
up
front
followed
by
a
solid
though
not
overwhelming
finish
of
coriander
along
with
the
orange
and
coriander
there
are
notes
of
lemon
zest
ginger
pepper
banana
and
clove
with
my
second
glass
i
poured
the
rest
of
the
beer
yeast
and
all
into
my
glass
it
becomes
obviously
a
bit
more
yeasty
with
notes
of
fresh
bread
and
it
becomes
quite
a
bit
more
hearty
this
is
quite
a
nice
witte
it
is
simple
refreshing
zesty
spritzy
it
reminds
me
of
a
warm
summer
afternoon
spent
sitting
on
the
porch
once
again
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
belgian
witte
a
nice
example
of
a
witbier
pleasurable
to
quaff
and
in
keeping
with
some
of
the
better
known
witbiers
nice
to
finally
find
it
in
my
area
overall
a
very
pleasing
light
bodied
brew
dont
drink
it
too
cold
my
expectations
were
not
met
here
hoping
a
for
better
style
interpretation
from
ommegang
all
of
their
other
beers
are
usually
dead
on
im
thinking
this
beer
might
not
be
at
its
freshest
not
the
brewerys
top
offering
in
fact
the
weakest
i
have
had
from
them
belgian
style
with
spicyness
and
wheat
sweetness
and
cream
rolled
into
one
would
have
worked
if
less
carbonated
had
at
blue
tusk
in
syracuse
medium
mouthfeel
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
excellent
witbier
and
very
belgian
in
style
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
very
well
crafted
nice
spicing
with
notes
of
coriander
sweet
oranges
caramel
and
butter
toffee
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
white
beer
but
this
didnt
quite
do
it
for
me
i
prefer
allagash
white
and
sph
double
white
750ml
25
4
oz
corked
and
caged
champagne
style
bottle
a
very
springy
yellow
color
with
an
ample
white
head
a
dry
mexican
aroma
ground
coriander
and
cumin
with
hints
of
citrus
grainy
almost
gives
the
feel
of
swishing
a
mouthful
of
crumbs
around
leaving
the
same
sensation
as
dotting
any
form
of
ground
seed
on
your
tongue
a
very
dry
beer
consisting
of
dried
orange
peel
and
dried
herbs
and
spices
in
the
flavor
appropriate
i
suppose
some
wits
especially
some
of
the
belgians
seem
to
have
a
little
more
body
a
certain
hefelike
proteinshake
creaminess
that
really
makes
them
sing
but
this
is
a
little
thinner
its
missing
that
little
extra
oompf
required
to
be
excellent
pours
an
okay
but
not
great
hazy
golden
colour
bubbkes
rise
to
the
top
to
reach
virtually
nothing
wheres
the
head
thats
the
biggest
problem
here
it
is
very
minimal
at
best
the
smell
is
very
nice
especially
for
an
american
version
of
the
style
sweet
and
fruity
withcitrus
and
wheat
notes
abound
orange
peel
and
spice
are
present
as
well
along
with
a
touch
of
earth
the
flavour
echoes
the
smell
but
is
very
bland
and
at
times
watery
flavour
is
only
really
present
at
the
end
with
a
sharp
orange
wheat
taste
thats
dry
but
satisfying
carbonation
levels
need
to
be
rasied
a
bit
too
this
beer
seemed
almost
flat
at
times
overall
this
one
has
alot
of
potential
and
while
definitely
not
a
bad
brew
could
be
much
much
better
id
call
it
slightly
above
average
right
now
at
best
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
bright
white
head
i
love
the
corked
bottles
but
it
plays
up
the
quality
of
the
beer
inside
in
this
case
a
very
solid
wit
but
nothing
really
special
sweet
yet
spicey
as
one
would
expect
a
good
introduction
into
the
world
of
belgian
style
beers
but
not
a
destination
worth
trying
though
this
is
a
very
nice
little
witbier
nice
cloudy
yellow
body
with
an
ok
head
the
aroma
had
a
nice
bit
of
orange
and
coriander
not
really
strong
but
not
weak
either
the
body
was
pretty
much
spot
on
for
style
with
more
body
than
some
like
hoegaarden
but
without
the
big
burst
of
flavor
of
others
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
likes
ok
witbeir
but
seemed
more
like
a
basic
wheat
refreshing
and
includes
some
of
my
favorite
flavors
from
belgium
i
love
it
drinkability

this
is
my
idea
of
the
style
standard
i
really
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
on
an
unusually
warm
sunday
september
afternoon
in
seattle
light
bodied
and
as
easy
drinking
as
the
style
should
be
very
good
on
a
hot
day
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
12
oz
bottle
pous
a
cloudy
golden
lemon
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
that
has
substance
with
its
crispness
grainy
wheat
malt
taste
upfront
banana
and
vanilla
flavors
arrive
shortly
midway
through
flavor
turns
more
lemony
and
citrus
spicy
coriander
and
yeast
in
the
finish
a
classic
representation
of
the
style
and
a
solid
offering
from
ommegang
the
appearance
of
this
beer
would
lead
one
to
believe
that
the
were
about
to
have
one
of
those
great
beer
drinking
experiences
the
beer
had
the
light
yellow
hue
and
a
great
head
like
all
wit
beers
should
have
what
was
lacking
in
this
presentation
was
the
taste
and
smell
i
could
not
detect
anything
in
the
aroma
and
the
same
for
the
taste
there
was
a
faint
taste
of
wheat
but
no
spiciness
or
citris
taste
not
one
of
their
best
brews
pours
nice
murky
gold
1mm
of
foam
left
on
top
smells
a
clean
fruit
and
wheat
it
is
beautifully
freshi
purchased
it
at
the
brewery
this
is
their
first
beer
that
is
available
on
tap
as
usual
draft
is
better
than
bottle
as
long
as
its
fresh
the
bottle
is
excellent
too
and
holds
a
decent
1mm
head
after
several
mins
nose
is
fruity
wheatyyeastyno
honey
though
i
get
tired
of
hefeweisse
anyway
taste
is
pure
gold
brilliance
but
not
as
malty
as
i
like
not
as
nutty
either
mouthfeel
is
fine
nothing
negative
to
say
about
it
this
is
slightly
dangerous
for
drinkabiltyyou
could
have
36
of
these
wo
much
difficulty
this
one
was
in
a
nice
cork
bottle
with
directions
on
the
lable
i
uncorked
with
a
little
disappointment
it
didnt
sound
very
lively
and
when
i
poured
it
was
a
little
less
carbonated
then
i
would
have
hoped
for
this
style
had
a
nice
head
a
little
thin
that
quickly
dissaperd
the
smell
was
of
light
fruit
nothing
overwhelmed
me
the
taste
was
a
little
bland
not
as
sharp
or
fizzy
that
iv
noticed
this
style
will
have
not
bad
butt
i
expected
more
nice
cloudy
lemon
yellow
with
a
thick
creamy
white
head
that
stayed
on
though
the
sipping
later
as
a
constant
thin
covering
scents
of
bananas
lemony
citrus
spicey
and
so
fresh
smooth
and
lightly
creamy
feeling
with
an
almost
medium
body
such
good
fresh
tastes
and
aromas
great
easy
drinker
good
session
could
sit
back
with
tons
of
these
on
a
warm
evening
this
came
in
a
corked
750
ml
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
this
poured
a
surprisingly
clear
yellow
with
about
half
an
inch
of
white
head
plenty
of
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
to
keep
the
head
alive
and
leaving
a
slight
lace
as
this
was
drank
on
the
second
glass
the
body
was
completely
murky
with
not
much
light
passing
through
the
smell
was
mainly
of
spices
such
as
coriander
and
pepper
with
a
good
yeasty
doughy
scent
present
as
well
the
taste
was
consistent
with
the
smell
as
the
main
focus
was
on
spice
with
no
other
flavors
really
dominating
there
was
a
nice
wheat
flavor
and
a
small
lemony
zest
as
well
something
about
the
taste
was
a
bit
odd
though
and
i
couldnt
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
mouthfeel
was
fairly
average
with
a
bit
of
over
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
though
as
the
taste
was
crisp
and
refreshing
not
a
bad
wit
beer
by
any
means
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
thanks
to
lupe
for
the
bottle
in
bif14
this
was
one
of
those
middle
of
the
road
belgian
wits
im
not
talking
about
taste
but
more
in
terms
of
sweetness
to
sourness
ratio
this
beer
was
really
neither
sweet
nor
sour
the
smell
was
really
yeasty
and
somewhat
musty
but
the
taste
was
much
different
fruity
notes
come
in
upfront
but
a
ripe
banana
yeast
precense
rides
in
on
the
thick
body
lots
of
spices
are
there
clove
orange
peel
pepper
and
they
really
seem
to
steal
the
show
the
finish
is
dry
but
has
a
lingering
quality
to
it
this
is
a
really
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
i
could
both
drink
quickly
and
drink
a
lot
of
without
getting
sick
of
it
comes
in
a
750ml
bottle
with
a
champagne
cork
pours
into
my
liefmans
goblet
a
rich
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
pretty
oneinch
white
head
ale
yeast
dominates
the
nose
with
background
notes
of
coriander
lemon
orange
and
alcohol
palate
is
tangy
up
front
with
lemony
overtones
and
notes
of
yeast
allspice
and
a
touch
of
hops
grain
comes
through
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
slightly
foamy
but
still
enjoyable
a
very
satisfactory
beer
to
wind
up
my
labor
day
weekend
light
refreshing
and
easily
consumable
imo
there
are
plenty
of
other
better
tasting
wits
out
there
a
good
beer
but
a
bit
disappointing
from
brewery
ommegang
this
is
by
far
my
least
favorite
from
these
guys
wheat
and
lemon
graze
the
nose
up
front
a
decent
medium
bodied
wit
zesty
lemon
and
wheat
flavors
give
way
to
some
biscuity
and
grainy
offerings
quite
tasty
and
very
satisfying
yeast
like
notes
on
the
palate
a
bit
creamy
finishes
tarty
and
tangy
but
cleansing
and
delicious
outstanding
bought
in
a
750oz
corked
bottle
this
one
pours
a
very
bright
yellow
color
and
has
a
tall
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
not
much
in
the
aroma
weak
but
some
hints
of
yeast
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
a
little
weak
but
still
nice
some
wheat
with
citrus
and
a
nice
grainy
texture
although
the
flavor
doesnt
pack
the
full
punch
i
was
expecting
it
still
has
a
great
character
and
flavor
good
beer
12oz
bottle
no
date
pours
a
very
light
gold
color
that
is
slightly
hazy
and
sports
a
white
as
snow
fluffy
head
that
diminishes
slightly
but
hangs
aroma
is
very
lemony
with
notes
of
yeast
and
orange
body
is
crisply
carbonated
and
light
flavor
is
sweet
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
coriander
orange
and
yeast
overall
not
the
greatest
but
not
a
bad
one
if
you
like
witbier
another
good
wit
but
not
among
the
elite
of
the
style
quite
citrusy
lemonlime
like
flavor
thin
and
carbonated
quite
refreshing
almost
tastes
like
lemonlime
soda
i
like
every
beer
ive
tried
from
this
brewery
although
i
like
allagash
and
unibroue
better
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
nicely
effervescent
which
i
feel
is
often
the
case
with
the
style
i
like
just
a
little
more
body
in
my
beer
but
i
cant
fault
them
for
this
thats
a
style
preference
for
me
and
this
beer
is
quite
true
to
the
style
drinkability
is
very
high
as
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
and
the
finish
is
refreshing
and
crisp
my
big
bottle
is
gone
before
i
know
it
its
not
the
best
witte
ive
had
but
at
4
95
for
a
big
bottle
how
can
you
go
wrongommegang
is
good
but
you
knew
that
the
only
drinkable
brew
ive
had
from
ommegang
as
far
as
wits
go
this
is
somewhat
better
than
average
but
it
needs
a
little
more
heft
throughout
i
would
still
pick
blue
moon
over
this
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
holy
moses
or
vuuve
still
id
buy
it
again
if
i
didnt
have
any
other
options
75
cl
corked
and
caged
bottle
pours
a
clouded
lemony
yellow
with
some
orange
highlights
and
a
huge
white
head
some
traditional
witbier
aromas
citrus
zest
coriander
and
wheat
acidity
slightly
perfumy
from
the
yeast
flavors
are
pretty
dulled
starts
wheaty
and
perfumy
goes
watery
midpalate
and
then
finishes
crisp
from
adequate
carbonation
and
slightly
acidic
overall
not
a
bad
experience
its
better
than
some
belgian
witbiers
ive
had
but
a
slight
bit
too
perfumy
for
the
style
a
very
refreshing
beer
still
it
is
number
4
of
4
in
their
line
up
for
me
cloudy
and
hazy
bright
yelloworange
color
spicy
earthy
citrus
aromas
nice
white
frothy
head
that
lasts
and
leaves
some
lacing
in
my
glass
fresh
tart
orange
and
mild
spice
flavors
crisp
carbonated
mouthfeel
finishes
clean
and
crisp
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
i
expected
big
things
from
ommegangs
witbier
and
the
pour
sure
lived
up
to
those
expectations
poured
a
peachkissed
bright
orange
in
color
fluffy
white
layer
of
head
fails
to
diminish
and
offers
a
lovely
sheeting
action
on
the
glass
aromas
are
very
muted
whiffs
of
yeasty
bread
orange
peel
and
spices
flavor
falls
short
of
the
mark
high
level
of
carbonation
overshadows
the
flavors
little
bits
of
wheat
flavor
mixed
with
spices
are
all
that
i
can
get
finishes
very
dry
and
unflavorful
with
a
champagnelike
quality
to
it
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
it
was
very
tough
to
drink
the
whole
bottle
of
this
its
glowing
hazy
gold
in
a
glass
the
smell
is
citrus
and
a
bit
of
spice
the
taste
is
also
predominantly
citrus
with
a
fairly
strong
lemon
bent
unfortunately
the
spicy
flavors
that
seem
to
want
to
come
through
remain
in
the
background
throughout
maybe
its
a
bit
too
subtle
for
my
taste
like
most
wits
its
quite
a
treat
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
this
flaxencolored
belgian
white
has
a
cloudy
appearance
and
a
moderate
head
it
has
a
pungent
sharp
smell
with
a
strong
clove
overtone
the
taste
is
sweet
with
hints
of
clove
and
banana
and
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
quite
enjoyable
belgian
deserving
of
several
offerings
pleasant
drinkable
brew
a
bit
too
mild
for
my
tastes
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
glassful
of
this
i
had
high
expectations
of
this
as
i
enjoy
ommegangs
other
beers
i
had
a
hard
time
writing
this
review
because
i
wanted
it
to
be
a
good
beer
sadly
it
isnt
drinkability
easy
enough
beer
to
put
down
but
kind
of
boring
i
wont
seek
this
one
out
cloudy
dimmed

with
a
moderate

noted
thin
white
head
lacing
is
average
at
best
doughy

corriander
pepper
and
other
spicy
tones
mix
together
on
the
nose
almost
smells
more
like
a
tripel

mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated

not
quite
overdone
lightmedium

id
like
to
see
more
orange
tones
and
more
wheat
properties
average
id
drink
it
again
if
someone
gave
me
one
otherwise
id
not
seek
it
light
and
tingly
on
the
tongue
the
flavor
mirrors
the
nose
and
this
nice
easydrinking
beer
is
an
excellent
american
example
of
the
style
and
very
enjoyable
if
uncomplex

tasting
initially
orange
peel
and
coriander
spicing
were
most
prominent
but
as
i
got
into
the
beer
the
spicing
took
on
more
of
a
clove
aspect
yeast
and
that
continued
to
dominate
the
spice
profile
throughout
the
level
of
sweetness
was
just
about
perfect
enough
to
compliment
the
spices
but
not
so
much
as
to
be
tiring
ommegangs
products
continue
to
be
some
of
the
most
reasonably
priced
ive
seen
good
value
for
the
money

id
like
to
give

size
a
shot
beer
is
good
happy
bitter
500
year
old
recipe
beering
overall
its
a
small
world
i
actually
tried
this
for
the
first
time
last
night
at
a
local
beer
tasting
held
at
the
wine
country
where
i
buy
some
of
my
craft
beer
from
then
this
morning
a
box
of
goodies
arrives
from
sir
mccall
this
was
a
part
of
the
beery
package
and
it
was
immediately
fridged
and
supercooled
using
liquid
nitrogen
such
was
my
impatience
to
try
it
as
the
sun
warmed
up
the
apartment
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
as
of
this
week
it
is
now
available
on
the
west
coast
and
costs
5
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
a
serious
bargain
in
my
opinion
thanks
and
cheers
to
sir
mccall
for
this
afternoons
sample
im
going
to
get
more
of
this
one
for
sure
excellent
it
pours
a
cloudy
gold
with
plenty
of
effervesence
with
a
nice
half
finger
of
head
it
has
a
strong
spicy
smell
over
a
base
of
malt
one
of
the
best
smelling
beers
ive
ever
encountered
the
beer
has
a
strong
malt
and
spice
taste
with
none
of
the
fruitiness
you
normally
get
in
a
witbier
the
beer
has
a
light
oily
feel
to
it
that
goes
down
easily
but
has
a
sharp
sour
finish
not
a
beer
that
i
would
avoid
but
im
sure
i
wouldnt
select
it
over
other
whites
on
the
market
something
i
have
thought
since
my
first
sip
should
go
first
oh
so
smooth
pasty
bronze
yellow
color
with
a
white
puffy
head
that
runs
away
almost
as
quickly
as
i
could
drink
this
i
should
note
that
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
i
did
enjoy
this
lemony
citrus
bitter
kind
of
wheat
beer
smell
there
is
a
clove
taste
up
front
and
a
bit
of
corriander
lemon
and
other
citrus
flavors
the
flavors
arent
over
powering
very
subtle
and
brilliantly
blended
light
body
very
thin
this
is
so
drinkable
it
hurts
wonderful
lemony
burps
and
it
just
goes
down
so
easy
with
the
subtle
flavors
dont
take
subtle
with
negative
connotation
it
is
just
that
they
are
all
blended
so
well
that
it
makes
a
great
summer
beer
i
dont
care
what
certain
brothers
say
certain
beers
do
fit
certain
situations
better
and
a
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
this
will
refresh
you
unbeleiveably
my
new
favorite
ommengang
offering
and
possibly
giving
me
a
new
found
intrest
in
wits
i
was
able
to
talk
my
wife
into
trying
by
telling
her
it
was
a
light
summer
brew
she
loved
it
just
found
a
nice
new
hidden
gem
that
sells
this
and
other
ommegang
brews
for
5
750ml
bottle
poured
into
an
ommegang
chalice
it
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
two
fingers
of
head
there
is
minimal
lacing
left
over
the
smell
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
all
the
classic
orange
and
coriander
you
would
expect
from
a
witbier
the
taste
is
a
great
blend
of
wheat
malt
citrus
and
spices
a
nice
peppery
finish
and
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
very
thick
and
heavy
for
a
witbier
the
drinkability
is
superb
as
well
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
ever
had
almost
as
good
as
allagash
white
banana
and
coriander
shine
through
with
some
orange
aspect
yeast
is
apparent
as
well
dry
finish
very
clean
drinkability
great
this
stuff
goes
down
super
easy
and
is
perfect
for
the
summer
but
it
lacks
the
complexity
ive
come
to
like
in
my
witbiers
so
allagash
is
going
to
remain
my
staple
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
and
considerable
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
with
an
overall
sensation
of
wheat
and
some
hints
of
citrus
and
cloves
i
was
disapointed
in
the
taste
it
is
considerably
milder
or
less
flavorful
than
many
other
wits
there
is
a
taste
of
the
predominant
wheat
with
a
small
citrus
belly
but
there
is
no
spiciness
that
you
find
in
other
wits
there
appears
to
be
less
bitterness
than
i
would
have
expected
also
the
beer
is
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
crisp
cleaness
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
memorable
either
a
very
solid
wit
though
it
doesnt
have
the
overt
spicing
of
some
other
wits
the
nice
citrus
character
is
a
unique
change
of
pace
and
one
that
i
appreciate
very
much
absolutely
one
that
i
would
have
again
one
final
note
you
dont
need
to
put
a
lemon
in
it
pretend
you
did
because
it
tastes
like
it
anyway
drinkability
sessionable
but
lacking
in
the
citrus
and
coriander
department
something
i
love
about
this
style
ill
take
the
local
old
dominion
summer
wheat
over
this
thanks
poured
into
a
large
pilsner
glass
this
wit
is
pale
yellow
in
color
and
hazy
with
sediment
large
and
fluffy
white
head
had
good
retention
aroma
was
of
wheat
yeast
and
citrus
with
spice
notes
of
coriander
spices
were
much
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
tasted
of
oranges
and
yeast
and
almost
a
gingerlike
spiciness
finish
is
far
from
dry
bitter
hops
coat
the
throat
in
a
lipsmacking
thristquenching
kinda
way
i
thought
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
was
topnotch
quality
i
will
definetely
be
buying
this
all
summer
as
it
is
perfect
for
the
season
year
round
for
that
matter
and
is
my
favorite
ommegang
so
far
damn
this
is
a
good
beer
so
very
simple
yet
so
complex
and
flavorful
i
know
in
my
reviews
i
say
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
but
literally
i
polished
off
a
750ml
by
myself
and
was
almost
tempted
to
go
pick
up
another
couple
right
then
and
there
to
drink
some
more
of
this
very
drinkable
session
beer
another
fantastic
beer
from
ommegang
hazy
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
nice
thick
2
head
very
light
lacing
does
develop
the
aroma
is
of
spice
and
wheat
the
flavor
is
different
from
some
others
in
this
style
as
the
wheat
citrus
and
coriander
tones
are
more
laid
back
but
are
nicely
balanced
a
light
tartness
kicks
in
up
front
and
it
is
very
dry
on
the
finish
this
is
lighter
in
body
and
had
nice
carbonation
levels
that
give
it
a
light
crispness
in
the
start
of
the
mouthfeel
good
summertime
brew
that
is
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
smooth
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
with
light
carbonation
lacks
in
flavor
but
is
still
quite
refreshing
to
drink
appearance
cloudy
golden
nectarine
color
with
a
vibrante
white
vanilla
cream
head
leaves
thick
intricate
lacing
aroma
coriander
cloves
and
orange
peels
along
with
the
unmalted
wheat
are
very
aromatic
wow
what
a
nice
witbier
taste
unmalted
wheat
lucious
layers
of
spice
mild
creamy
finish
excellent
im
liking
this
cooperstown
offering
the
coriander
is
just
right
mouthfeel
medium

tame

silky

perfect
going
down
drinkability
this
is
the
most
accurate
american
brewed
witbier
i
have
tried
dead
on
to
style
notes
nice
wit
from
a
solid
brewery
good
example
of
how
beers
in
this
style
can
differ
slightly
drinkablity
notes
my
palate
got
lost
in
the
tartness
it
seemed
the
flavors
did
not
meld
well
and
everything
was
separate
a
good
brew
though
there
are
many
witbiers
that
fit
the
shoe
better
than
this
one
the
flavor
is
good
the
the
refreshing
character
is
the
real
strength
here
basic
and
crisp
it
goes
in
a
straight
line
and
does
a
fine
job
of
wiping
out
any
signs
of
thirst
its
smooth
on
the
way
down
and
calling
it
drinkable
would
be
an
understatement
okay
it
may
not
be
best
in
show
but
its
good
enough
and
crisply
fun
enough
to
warrant
some
doovers
appearance
is
a
very
light
murky
yellow
rivaling
the
color
of
many
macroswill
out
there
but
at
least
i
know
there
will
be
flavor
behind
this
to
back
up
that
color
head
is
decent
white
and
soapy
leaving
little
to
no
lace
smell
has
lots
of
wheat
and
banana
with
some
fig
hints
and
no
hops
to
be
had
the
taste
is
very
very
light
and
rivaling
on
tart
but
is
a
bit
hard
to
pick
out
there
are
some
grassy
wheats
definatley
and
some
malt
with
some
more
of
the
starchy
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
yet
very
carbonated
with
larger
bubbles
much
like
soda
water
this
is
my
first
witte
beer
and
i
think
it
was
a
good
one
to
start
on
raw
grain
tart
lemony
flavours
tons
of
spicy
coriander
subtle
hints
of
orange
a
bit
heavy
handed
with
the
coriander
lightmedium
bodied
smooth
moderate
carbonation
thirst
quenching
refreshing
im
not
usually
one
to
sit
and
drink
witte
all
day
but
the
dry
finish
and
light
touch
make
this
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
i
was
pretty
excited
when
i
saw
this
brew
in
the
liquor
store
i
usually
go
to
it
pours
out
a
hazy
yellow
color
the
smell
and
taste
as
you
would
expect
are
citrusy
seems
like
more
people
were
struck
by
the
lemon
taste
but
i
found
an
orange
taste
more
prevailing
what
was
really
great
about
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
this
wit
is
very
well
carbonated
and
feels
good
on
the
tongue
it
was
a
bit
dry
however
and
i
think
could
be
more
refreshing
all
in
all
a
good
product
put
forth
by
ommegang
picked
this
up
at
liquor
depot
to
my
surprise
750ml
bottle
for
4
25
not
bad
poured
out
a
solid
light
orange
color
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
little
more
dull
but
thats
fine
by
me
smell
was
refreshing
as
well
citrus
aromas
blended
in
with
some
spice
and
yeast
taste
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
but
yet
flavorful
which
is
great
for
the
summer
months
orange
and
lemon
hit
the
palate
with
some
wheat
and
grain
flavors
which
blend
in
so
nicely
carbonation
is
really
good
in
this
brew
a
nice
amount
in
there
i
must
say
one
the
of
top
3
wits
out
there
a
very
nice
brew
a
good
brew
that
is
above
average
in
all
aspects
pours
a
nice
lemon
color
with
smallish
lacing
head
smell
is
definite
lemon
citrus
and
wheat
undertones
taste
was
light
wheat
with
a
lemon
flavor
mouthfeel
was
dry
throughout
but
not
overly
so
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
light
bodied
with
a
refreshing
dry
crispness
throughout
defintely
a
go
to
witstyle
beer
not
an
overly
bold
or
different
rendition
simply
a
nice
wellstuctured
and
traditional
one
a
cloudy
light
yellow
colour
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
of
foam
that
stays
around
for
the
long
haul
leaving
some
nice
lace
patterns
on
the
glass
the
aromas
are
complex
and
lovely
i
smell
coriander
citrus
peel
belgian
yeast
wheat
some
slightly
bitter
citruslike
hops
and
some
nice
bready
malts
the
taste
is
light
and
flavorful
at
the
same
time
as
the
spicing
of
this
brew
is
very
good
the
spices
hit
up
front
with
the
wheaty
opening
of
this
brew
the
middle
is
a
bit
hoppy
and
citruslike
and
the
finish
is
lightly
bready
crisp
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
this
is
a
damn
good
american
witte
perhaps
even
better
than
hoegaarden
nice
white
12
head
on
top
of
this
straw
hued
brew
nice
grainy
aroma
to
go
with
good
lacing
taste
is
as
well
a
bit
grainy
which
is
backed
up
by
the
mouthfeel
seems
to
be
somewhat
thin
in
the
craw
but
overall
certainly
drinkable
a
thirstquencher
for
the
yard
etc
rivals
hoegaarden
for
what
its
worth
a
very
slight
but
elegant
witbier
that
is
pushing
hard
on
hennepin
to
be
my
favorite
beer
from
ommegang
as
after
a
few
it
has
been
growing
and
growing
on
me
drink
at
least
a
couple
before
you
form
an
opinion
in
the
least
your
tongue
will
be
happy
but
with
time
your
brain
will
come
around
to
it
thats
my
experience
an
extremely
drinkable
refreshing
witte
for
these
hot
humid
summer
days
great
job
ommegang
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
very
pleasant
wheat
scent
which
is
enhanced
by
the
presence
of
fruity
belgian
wit
yeast
it
comes
across
dry
yet
refreshing
the
taste
is
decent
but
not
great
it
comes
off
as
being
dry
and
a
bit
weak
and
watery
there
is
the
clove
flavor
but
the
fruitiness
is
quickly
lost
as
you
swallow
the
wheat
flavor
fine
it
seems
a
bit
bland
and
stale
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
wit
beer
this
is
not
at
the
same
level
as
the
other
ommegang
offerings
drinkability
this
is
the
best
american
white
i
think
ive
ever
had
id
drink
it
everyday
if
i
could
find
it
in
bottles
i
like
this
brew
alot
and
am
intending
to
purchase
sixtel
for
a
summer
party
this
beer
was
served
in
a
ommegang
witte
glass
very
interesting
looking
at
monks
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
it
had
a
beautiful
orangish
color
the
nice
citrus
flavors
are
present
throughout
and
in
the
smell
as
well
very
refreshing
not
too
many
spicy
belgian
yeast
esters
compared
to
other
belgians
which
i
like
better
for
a
summer
beer
this
gets
high
marks
for
its
drinkability
if
you
like
the
style
i
would
definitely
grab
one
of
these
overall
this
is
an
only
average
wit
for
its
price
i
bought
a
sixpack
of
this
at
beers
of
the
world
which
cost
me
nearly
14
00
at
this
amount
i
was
expecting
something
out
of
this
world
or
at
least
something
better
than
average
in
turn
i
got
something
very
average
next
time
i
will
stick
to
my
allagash
white
its
better
and
it
costs
nearly
six
dollars
less
excluding
the
issue
of
price
there
are
still
much
better
beers
of
this
style
out
there

a
party
favor
from
the
americanbelgian
beer
dinner
at
oscars
restaurant
overall
this
is
a
good
belgian
witbier
but
nothing
special
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
the
style
solid
but
not
spectacular
its
alright
but
nothing
special
overall
one
of
my
favorite
beers
from
boulevard
i
know
its
not
a
crowd
favorite
but
its
one
of
the
earliest
craft
beers
i
remember
as
being
a
gamechanger
for
my
perspective
on
craft
beer
finally
reviewing
it
after
all
these
years
in
order
to
encourage
others
to
give
it
a
go
o
a
tasty
take
on
the
belgian
wit
definitely
a
great
summertime
brew
worth
checking
out
and
buying
again

and
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
day
sampled
on
9713
chilled
down
to
36
degrees
in
my
beer
cooler
and
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
small
white
head
some
lacing
is
seen
average
carbonation
but
not
overly
done
the
aroma
is
of
mostly
grains
wheat
and
coriander
the
coriander
really
is
the
first
thing
you
taste
with
a
hint
of
citrus
with
a
slight
hoppy
aftertaste
an
overall
satisfying
summer
ale
nothing
mindboggling
no
new
trends
established
just
a
solid
tasty
witbier
very
suitable
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
o
good
summertimer
nothing
stands
out
might
be
a
little
rich
for
really
hot
days
relatively
speaking
its
good
not
great
overall
pretty
refreshing
really
nothing
wrong
here
pours
very
cloudy
with
very
little
head
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
mixture
of
orange
and
apple
juice
aroma
is
citrus
with
a
nice
kick
of
spices
taste
also
citrus
and
spice
along
with
banana
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
overall
very
light
and
refreshing
a
perfect
summer
beer
overall
kind
of
boring
but
easy
to
drink
was
expecting
a
bit
more
decent
but
overpriced
for
what
it
is
their
pale
wheat
beer
is
much
better
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
the
summer
if
im
looking
for
something
to
drink
where
i
dont
have
to
concentrate
then
this
is
it
trying
the
zon
for
the
first
time
in
awhile
i
found
this
in
the
reduced
price
bin
at
binnys
the
beer
pours
a
pee
cloudy
yellow
with
almost
no
head
and
no
lace
the
scent
carries
wisps
of
spice
and
lemon
citrus
the
taste
follows
the
scent
fairly
closely
some
decent
bitterness
with
good
balanced
sweet
belgium
style
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
ok
good
fro
warmer
summer
months
summary
not
very
good
overall
its
really
not
much
of
a
beer
its
too
light
and
flavorless
to
be
a
witbier
im
not
getting
this
one
again
glad
i
didnt
get
a
6pack
right
on
the
mark
per
style
zôn
is
an
obvious
choice
for
those
hot
midwestern
summer
days
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
boulevard
selection
will
drink
again
o
solid
beer
its
a
good
wheat
beer
and
would
be
perfect
on
hot
summer
days
the
flavors
are
nice
but
nothing
about
this
beer
really
stands
out
i
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
clove
punch
and
maybe
some
stronger
banana
esters
but
overall
i
dig
it
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
around
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
a
whole
lot
of
it
oan
easy
drinking
summer
beer
it
smells
great
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
doesnt
hold
up
o
just
not
very
good
allaround
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
several
of
these
backtoback
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
very
sessionable

very
nice

o
another

from

keep
them
coming
a
wonderful
example
of
the
witbier
style
and
the
first
one
ive
really
loved
something
easy
that
i
could
drink
anyday
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
shockingly
so
i
did
not
expect
a
witbier
to
impress
me
so
much
so
i
may
need
to
research
this
style
a
little
more
read

you
could
session
this
one
easily
the
most
surprising
part
about
the
whole
deal
was
that
the
misses
asked
if
i
could
get
a
six
pack
the
next
time
i
was
out
she
generally
hates
beer
and
especially
the
porters
and
stouts
that
i
like
but
she
enjoyed
this
kudos
to
boulevard
i
would
highly
recommend
it
and
i
would
drink
and
buy
it
again
as
i
understand
it
this
is
only
a
seasonal
beer
summer
of
course
and
boy
what
a
session
beer
for
a
hot
humid
american
summer
day
i
could
see
being
at
an
all
day
4th
of
july
picnic
knocking
down
a
sixpack
or
two
if
not
driving
with
no
problem
i
just
wish
it
were
sold
outside
of
missouri
and
its
bordering
states
pretty
neat
little
belgian
ale
here
very
summer
pours
a
hazy
small
headed
hay
color
with
a
nose
of
belgian
yeast
wheat
malt
and
citrus
sort
of
pollenated
feeling
flavor
yeasty
and
bright
orange
and
spice
mouthfeel
is
nice
too
pleanty
of
bubbles
and
a
moderate
mody
this
side
of
medium
cloudy
mashy
finish
lends
well
to
the
experience
nice
beer
more
suited
to
july
than
january
but
a
nice
brew
o
not
a
fan
i
was
excited
to
try
this
since
i
loved
the
two
jokers
but
odiously
this
one
has
its
flaws
i
will
try
a
fresh
bottle
next
time
to
get
a
fair
evaluation
pours
cloudy
golden
yellow
good

slight

taste
is
a
subtle
tart

banked
by
a
clean

easy
finish
light
carbonation
smooth
and
balanced
good
summer
beer
for
sure
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
a
nice
crisp
spicy
bite
that
lingers
over
the
sweetness
into
a
slight
dry
finish
lots
of
zesty
spice
with
hints
of
pepper
clove
and
lemon
zest
which
is
countered
midpalate
by
the
bready
yeast
citrus
fruit
and
banana
the
yeast
adds
fullness
to
the
palate
and
along
with
the
sweetener
notes
provides
flavorful
balance
complex
flavorful
and
very
easy
to
drink
especially
in
warmer
weather
overall
not
a
bad
brew
but
there
are
better
wits
out
there
i
bought
the
boulevard
sampler
pack
and
this
was
actually
one
of
the
better
ones
from
the
overall
weak
pack
overall
great
summer
choice
but
then
again
this
beer
is
representative
of
the
sun
d
this
beer
goes
down
extremely
easily
this
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
it
is
a
very
easily
approachable
one
tasty
slightly
complex
and
well
balanced
pretty
solid
beer
from
a
very
solid
brewery
o
this
brew
is
kind
of
blah
some
good
flavors
in
there
but
they
dont
balance
with
each
other
would
drink
this
again
on
a
hot
day
but
will
never
go
looking
for
it
a
pretty
standard
affair
belgian
wit
the
flavors
are
all
good
but
seem
a
bit
lacking
overall
and
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
thin
overall
impression
such
a
nice
refreshing
witbier
awesome
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
enjoy
seeing
this
spice
and
peppery
feel
in
this
one
with
good
citrus
tastes
will
be
looking
for
again
my
first
time
enjoying
and
am
a
huge
fan
do
full
of
delicious
and
styleappropriate
flavor
this
seasonal
wit
from
boulevard
came
as
a
pleasant
and
unexpected
surprise
with
no
new
moves
to
display
it
is
instead
like
an
old
friend
that
has
returned
after
too
long
it
is
capable
of
reminding
even
a
jaded
beer
enthusiast
of
what
they
used
to
like
about
the
style
before
they
moved
on
to
more
extreme
terrain
simply
a
delight
overall
this
beer
has
some
flavor
flaws
but
other
than
that
is
pretty
decent
id
give
it
another
try
if
i
saw
it
around
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
aroma
of
coriander
upfront
with
some
citrus
in
the
back
taste
follows
the
nose
very
pure
and
true
to
the
style
wit
beer
not
the
beat
but
really
damn
good
i
like
this
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
hoegarden
smooth
and
easy
drinking
i
like
it
back
to
workin
my
way
through
the
boulevard
variety
pack
this
bit
pours
a
cloudy
pale

topped
by
a
finger
of
bright
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
coriander
black
pepper
salt
belgian
yeast
lemon
zest
white
bread
and
a
small
current
of
sweet
caramel
waaayyy
in
the
back
the
taste
doesnt
change
too
much
up
though
the
lemon
comes
through
stronger
and
the
salt
is
amped
heavily
i
wouldnt
necessarily
call
the
result
salty

like

this
brew
comes
to
you
with
a
bright
yellow
color
and
white
foamy

the
aroma
is
quite
tangy
with
a
greater
hint
of
banana
than
the
german
wheat
the
flavor
is
a
bit
lighter
than
the
german

but
still
tasty
and

there
is

not
my

but

very
good
representation

decent

far
from

a
slight

of

on

the
taste
is
rather
subdued

nothing
more
not
bad
but
nowhere
near
the

of
this
class
more
cloudy
than
the
light
haziness
i
expected
but
ok
pours
a
bright

short

the

is
quite
impressive
very
authentically
belgian

a
light
citrus

some
spiciness
and
a
sweet
fruitiness

maybe
a
little
mango
in
the
back
there
somewhere
i
even
pick
up
some
bubblegum
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
the
flavor
is
more
subdued
with
a
very
limited
malt
and
a
light
dry
fruitiness
theres
some
coriander
at
mid
swallow
and
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
light
touch
of
acidity
the
light
bodied
but
zesty
palate
helps
to
pull
this
off
ajustaboveaverage
beer
with
a
good
label
and
name
that
has
no
flaws
but
leaves
me
almost
wishing
it
had
some
to
give
it
a
little
bit
of
complexity
of
course
there
are
belgian
wits
that
have
the
same
straightforward
noncomplexity
so
i
cant
fault
them
for
it
this
is
my
perfect
lawnmower
beer
i
picked
up
4
varieties
from
boulevard
brewing
co
while
i
was
in
iowa
last
weekend
i
wanted
to
get
some
stone
city
but
i
didnt
travel
far
enough
south
to
find
that
these
blvd
brews
were
definitely
a
surprise
though
all
4
were
pretty
solid
the
other
3
should
follow
tonight
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
good
but
tastes
more
like
a
weak
hefeweizen
than
a
belgian
wit
decent
beer
but
does
not
live
up
to
the
standards
set
by
pierre
celis
hoegaarden
celis
goes
great
with
scrambled
eggs
and
sausage
dont
ask
i
was
disappointed
in
this
boulevard
product
id
drink
it
again
but
it
is
not
worth
purchasing
a
6pack

very
hazy
straw

w
ample

but
the
poorly
retained
head
is
a
bit
disappointing
loads
of
bubblegum
esters
hit
the
nose
at
first
and
are
followed
by
clove
and
phenolic
notes
spices
round
out
the
nose
and
include
the
typical
bitter
orange
notes
and
coriander
but
i
swear
i
detect
a
hint
of
star
anise
in
there
also
fairly
light
in
body
for
a
wheat
and
unfortunately
fairly
light
in
flavor
as
well
the
taste
doesnt
continue
where
the
aroma
left
off
upfront
wheat
tartness
is
followed
by
very
mild
phenol
and
green
apple
flavors
finishes
dry
and
unexciting
that
being
said
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
the
trick
is
to
not
think
of
it
as
a
real
belgian
wit
but
a
wit
american
hefeweizen
hybrid
o
a
very
enjoyable
experience
and
the
first
boulevard
offering
ive
liked
out
of
what
ive
tried
had
i
been
able
to
find
a
case
of
this
it
would
have
come
home
with
me
the
beer
has
a
great
look
is
is
a
little
hazy
kinda
orange
with
a
decent
head
and
carbonation
the
smell
jumps
out
at
you
very
spicy
i
liked
it
very
much
and
was
very
intrigued
the
taste
followed
the
smell
but
the
orange
takes
the
lead
instead
of
the
spice
you
really
pick
up
the
citrus
mostly
orange
there
is
some
spice
but
it
is
perfectly
subdued
and
also
just
a
touch
of
sour
after
noticing
the
sour
i
then
began
to
notice
it
in
the
smell
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
clean
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
there
is
no
notice
of
the
8
abv
overall
i
was
shocked
how
much
i
like
this
beer
i
will
have
to
get
another
one
of
these
too
many
spices
in
this
one
could
have
been
better
beer
was
ok
not
great
great
beer
for
the
style
a
cross
between
a
saison
and
a
wit
the
beer
leaves
you
wanting
more
and
a
slight
sour
feel
at
the
back
of
your
mouth
as
the
beer
goes
down
this
is
a
great
beer
with
a
slight
crazy
side
the
brew
masters
were
brilliant
when
they
came
up
with
this
recipe
overall
an
unique
take
on
the
style
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
throughout
the
balance
is
a
bit
off
with
the
citrus
not
making
way
for
some
of
the
spice
characteristics
but
if
you
enjoy
saisons
or
sours
this
may
be
one
that
youd
want
to
seek
out
i
would
drink
it
again
but
one
glass
in
a
sitting
is
all
that
would
retain
my
interest
mouthfeel
is
fairly
rich
and
the
alcohol
is
well
masked
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
quite
the
witbier
on
steroids
that
i
was
expecting
overall
a
pretty
good
twist
on
a
belgian
style
wheat
beer
good
mix
of
spices
that
are
big
but
dont
overwhelm
the
fruit
flavors
a
nicely
unique
and
tasty
wit
total
4050
balance
is
met
with
some
tropical
fruit
like
sweetness
as
well
and
finishes
with
a
slightly
sour
kick
overall
awesome
double
wit
love
the
twist
between
old
and
new
it
works
for
me
t
strongly
sour
with
a
hint
of
honey
and
coriander
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
having
much
experience
with
this
style
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
and
had
to
actually
read
about
the
style
before
i
wrote
the
review
i
am
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
from
boulevards
smokestack
series
condor
recommended
condor

great
tasting

especially
for

blue

easytodrink
theres
a
lot
going
on
in
this
glass
o
a
lot
more
sour
than
i
expected
from
a
witbier
feel
like
it
is
a
bit
of
a
hybrid
of
styles
tastes
great
and
refreshing
but
the
sweetness
became
a
little
overwhelming
in
the
second
tier
of
boulevards
belgianstyle
beers
serving
type
bottle
i
dont
know
what
theyre
talking
about
all
i
can
see
is
a
glass
with
some
interesting
atmospheric
decorations
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
hazy
brassgold
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
lemon
zest
light
sunny
d
clove
a
touch
of
black
pepper
and
a
hint
of
cracked
wheat
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
a
healthy
amount
of
slightly
tart
lemonclementine
and
orange
guiding
the
spicy
wheat
ship
to
glory
in
the
napoleonic
wars
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
damn
tasty
wit
sorry
double
wit
i
need
more
of
this
overall
i
really
like
the
idea
aimed
for
with
this
beer
i
just
think
the
coriander
is
a
little
too
strong
it
dominates
the
flavor
and
lingers
behind
after
a
sip
if
it
were
a
bit
more
refreshing
and
with
less
coriander
this
would
be
a
great
beer
as
a
wit
its
a
bit
tart
as
a
sour
its
a
bit
weak
as
a
combination
it
seems
just
a
bit
confused
that
said
theres
really
nothing
wrong
but
it
didnt
really
work
for
me
two
jokers
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
very
small
head
there
is
a
very
big
bold
aroma
lots
of
sweet
belgian
candy
notes
hints
of
orange
the
taste
has
big
notes
of
orange
various
spices
belgian
candies
and
finishes
with
first
a
tartness
then
a
creamy
wheat
flavor
a
little
flat
but
big
flavors
overall
its
very
flavorful
nice
fruit
flavors
not
overly
sweet
good
stuff
very
refreshing
o
very
unique
flavors
going
on
here
theyve
pretty
much
pinpointed
the
ideal
construct
of
an
imperial
witbier
overall
one
of
the
more
interesting
takes
on
a
witbier
that
i
have
had
in
a
while
i
get
a
lot
of
lavender
in
this
beer
and
it
is
a
taste
i
really
enjoy
for
me
this
will
be
one
of
my
go
to
witbiers
really
neat
beast
pours
golden
with
sticky
lacing
loads
of
spice
in
the
nose
and
in
the
taste
coriander
and
zest
heaped
upon
a
thin
wheat
backbone
then
theres
the
lactofunk
which
really
makes
this
brew
interesting
i
just
reviewed
nodas
gose
it
couldve
used
some
of
this
complexity
neat
brew
ooverall
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
wit
beer
would
get
some
more
what
an
interesting
take
on
a
heavily
spiced
witbier
they
really
showed
off
on
this
one
hazy
yellow
pour
with
a
onefinger
white
head
very
nice
citrus
lemon
and
yeast
aroma
excellent
lemony
tart
flavor
upfront
with
a
nice
tropical
fruit
edge
light
body
has
a
strong
spice
presence
with
flavors
of
coriander
and
clove
standing
out
also
has
very
light
hints
of
grain
and
yeast
finishes
tart
juicy
and
refreshing
simply
awesome
this
ranks
up
there
with
tank
7
as
my
favorite
beer
from
my
favorite
brewery
from
missouri
if
you
see
it
grab
it
and
youll
be
blown
away
nothing
quite
like
this
one
on
the
market
a
jazzed
up
wit
with
all
kinds
of
fragrant
character
and
depth
blonde
and
hazy
looks
the
part
bubbles
are
huge
and
plentiful
nice
for
hot
weather
the
nose
is
where
it
gets
interesting
cardamom
is
there
and
the
lavender
they
claim
is
right
up
front
short
of
perfumy
but
getting
there
the
spices
seem
to
clash
a
little
with
the
classic
orange
and
coriander
while
congruent
in
the
nose
they
seem
disjointed
and
at
odds
in
the
taste
especially
the
finish
where
the
blooming
lavender
is
too
much
i
super
dig
the
tartness
to
this
though
the
yeast
is
so
much
more
than
the
average
wit
style
yeast
there
is
a
funk
here
almost
saisonesque
as
it
wraps
up
wheat
malt
base
is
much
larger
than
most
but
it
never
gets
heavy
and
it
never
gets
sweet
in
fact
the
feel
is
fantastic
lively
carbonation
and
a
smoothness
to
it
refreshing
save
the
high
alcohol
content
which
is
more
distracting
than
helpful
in
this
particular
beer
but
the
smokestack
series
continues
to
be
incredible
and
distinct
one
of
my
favorite
lines
in
commercial
american
brewing
worth
a
try
for
its
originality
overall
this
beer
may
be
better
than
i
remember
it
but
my
palate
has
come
a
long
way
since
i
first
had
it
many
years
ago
this
was
one
of
the
earliest
examples
of
boulevards
new
smokestack
series
offerings
i
ever
had
and
having
it
was
a
gateway
into
boulevard
coming
into
its
own
when
it
comes
to
belgian
styles
the
reprise
of
this
fan
favorite
is
a
welcome
addition
to
hopefully
their
regular
lineup
it
reminds
me
of
a
hyperevolved
version
of
ciscos
wonderful
grey
ladya
super
spicy
lightly
sweet
wit
that
tastes
like
a
combination
of
wonderful
potpourri
and
a
handful
of
strange
victorianera
candies
o
im
glad
its
back
surprised
that
i
enjoyed
it
so
much
back
before
id
had
much
beer
experience
this
has
a
distinguishable
bitterness
the
fruit
notes
are
much
more
obvious
as
well
as
an
inoffensive
grain
note
the
tartness
is
another
good
step
away
from
faceless
witbiers
all
in
all
everything
could
mesh
together
a
little
better
but
still
a
wonderful
beer
good
beer
i
was
taken
back
by
how
citrusy
the
beer
tasted
but
as
i
drank
became
very
accustomed
to
the
taste
very
light
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
overall
a
very
interesting
brew
ive
never
encountered
a
beer
that
accomplishes
what
this
does
giving
off
an
aroma
that
isnt
anywhere
close
to
the
actual
taste
beautiful
oyeah
the
bottle
was
older
as
it
has
been
discontinued
fresh
maybe
it
will
be
better
drink
it
now
if
you
have
any
lying
body
is
medium
to
mediumheavy
with
midlevel
carbonation
the
beer
foams
up
across
the
palate
resulting
in
a
generally
smooth
mouthfeel
still
the
ethanol
presence
is
easily
felt
giving
a
subtle
burning
sensation
across
the
tongue
and
into
the
nostrils
finish
is
semidry
pours
out
a
hazy
darker
goldenorange
color
with
a
tall
frothy
head
with
several
minutes
of
stability
and
decent
quality
lacing
smells
and
tastes
exactly
like
a
4060
ratio
hybrid
between
a
berliner
weiss
and
a
highergravity
belgian
wit
tart
lemony
lactic
pucker
with
florals
phenolics
and
a
touch
of
horseblanket
funk
combined
with
spiced
citrus
peel
citrus
juice
and
garnished
by
white
pepper
balanced
exceptionally
well
in
the
precise
middle
point
between
dryness
and
sweetness
my
only
criticism
is
that
the
body
came
across
as
somewhat
too
far
on
the
heavy
side
of
medium
thickness
for
my
preferences
despite
the
valiant
efforts
of
the
carbonation
it
got
a
bit
sludgy
and
left
a
thin
sort
of
residue
coating
film
on
the
inside
surface
of
my
mouth
but
i
can
deal
with
it
because
the
lingering
film
has
a
flavor
that
i
actually
enjoy
i
just
wish
it
didnt
cling

globs

big

minimal

the

but
lots
of
sweet

robust

the
taste
is
huge
banana

clove
very
sweet
and
very
tart
the
tart
does
help
balance
out
the
sweet
fruit
flavors
so
they
are
not
cloying
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
with
the
tart
dominating
the
finish
overall
a
good
wheat
beer
i
think
the
tartness
was
unexpected
but
really
helped
balance
the
beer
o
excellent
wit
lots
going
on
overall
this
beer
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
the
spice
was
quite
nice
and
the
malt
backed
it
up
perfectly
i
would
have
another
o
i
think
this
is
a
really
solid
beer
its
smooth
and
creamy
to
start
but
finishes
tart
and
dry
i
like
it
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
this
on
the
regular
but
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
it
id
seek
it
out
another
impressive
offering
from
boulevard
d
really
great
wit
so
much
attention
to
detail
not
much
else
to
say
the
smokestack
series
has
not
disappointed
me
yet
their
belgians
especially
o
this
is
a
perfect
witbier
for
winter
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
style
light
but
noticeable
spicing
and
a
very
pleasant
tartness
id
love
to
have
this
again
the
first
chance
i
get

is
an
excellent

great
balance

big
complexity
and
very
smooth
to

for
the
level
of
alcohol
really
enjoyed
this
one
o
1st
witbier
and
will
not
be
my
last
very
impressed
with
this
brew
and
will
enjoy
more
in
the
future
o
the
price
was
right
and
so
was
the
taste
great
stuff
tried
the
two
jokers
at
a
beer
tasting
last
night
i
think
this
beer
should
be
called
a
ginger
beerit
has
a
huge
ginger
ale
taste
and
smell
with
punch
of
lemonlime
big
carbonation
white
foamy
head
not
much
lace
the
beer
is
cloudyhazed
straw
yellow
color
with
massive
carbonation
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
the
mouthfeelis
medium
to
big
body
overall
i
would
say
this
is
a
sipping
beer
certainly
not
a
bad
beer
just
something
i
havent
quite
developed
a
taste
for
too
many
competing
flavors
and
sensations
i
guess
you
could
say
its
complex
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
too
filling
well
hidden
kick
nice
representation
of
style
o
a
very
good
witbier
i
personally
do
not
prefer
the
tartness
of
the
citrus
in
the
taste
but
many
likely
will
still
a
very
nice
wit
that
i
will
enjoy
next
summer
o
quite
tasty
and
surprisingly
high
in
abv
but
showed
no
sign
of
it
at
all
nice
beer
except
it
seemed
a
bit
low
in
terms
of
carbonation
which
is
a
bit
odd
for
the
smokestack
series
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
there
was
a
huge
white
frothy
head
on
it
the
head
lingers
awhile
and
leaves
some
lacing
decent
aroma
to
it
wheat
citrus
and
some
coriander
and
other
spices
the
taste
is
very
good
good
wheat
body
definitely
more
than
a
typical
wit
wheat
lemon
and
other
citrus
dominate
the
taste
some
spices
other
fruits
banana
other
tropical
in
there
also
nice
another
keeper
from
the
smokestack
series
notes
not
a
typical
witbier
more
like
a
mix
between
a
wit
and
a
tripel
overall
it
was
pretty
tasty
with
a
nice
amount
of
fruitiness
but
nothing
overly
sweet
enjoyable
beer
especially
for
a
warm
day
hazy
goldenorange
zero
lacing
from
a
foamy
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
smell
was
tart
along
with
some
fruity
white
grapes
somebody
else
mentioned
sprite
in
their
review
thats
certainly
near
the
taste
something
like
a
fruity
punch
spiked
with
sprite
the
mouthfeel
is
bright
crisp
highly
carbonated
quite
frankly
i
wish
this
was
750
ml
of
sprite
i
could
use
a
sprite
right
now
to
cleanse
my
palate
now
im
done
drink
it
for
a
pleasant
evening
when
the
beer
shouldnt
be
the
main
attraction
overall
im
not
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
rare
naysay
for
this
one
overall
a
strong
showing
of
an
american
style
wit
while
it
may
lack
some
of
the
yeast
character
of
a
traditional
wit
its
such
a
full
rounded
flavor
the
defining
characteristics
citrus
zest
hint
of
clove
and
so
on
can
be
used
to
describe
so
many
beers
in
and
out
of
this
style
but
this
ones
worth
spending
some
time
with
to
explore
all
the
nuances
as
an
added
plus
the
bottle
in
my
experience
really
is
just
as
good
as
finding
it
on
tap
one
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
that
could
be
consumed
in
large
quantities
overall
impression
perfectly
refreshing
has
nice
body
and
punch
to
it
and
nice
fruit
flavors
added
ive
enjoyed
this
now
ontap
and
bottle
both
were
phenomenal
and
dont
remember
much
difference
between
these
two
get
your
hands
on
if
you
can
the
acidic
tartness
was
a
nice
touch
and
unexpected
a
great
summertime
beer
the
taste
is
initially
a
yogurty
lactic
beauty
creamy
and
tart
it
definitely
delivers
the
goods
on
that
end
and
blends
perfectly
with
the
mouthfeel
as
the
beer
warms
the
spices
come
to
the
forefront
but
they
are
much
more
muted
than
the
nose
id
probably
prefer
a
bit
less
of
a
potpourri
and
a
stronger
traditional
belgian
white
spice
blend
to
come
forth
but
this
does
its
job
of
expanding
my
mind
of
what
a
beer
can
be
can
you
really
ask
for
more
than
that
drinkability
is
okay
its
a
lighter
dry
brew
and
the
high
abv
is
well
hidden
but
way
to
spicy
for
my
taste
i
love
classic
wit
biers
these
homebrew
kitchen
sink
style
ones
much
less
so
enjoy
boulevards
simplesounding
tweak
to
two
jokers
making
the
beer
25
sour
has
resulted
in
a
nearly
flawless
beer
this
is
the
shining
example
of
the
imperial
witbier
in
the
world
you
must
drink
this
beer
everything
about
this
brew
screams
extreme
it
comes
close
to
delivering
hits
its
high
point
in
the
nose
spicing
is
overthetop
but
tasty
nonetheless
another
good
beer
from
boulevard
o
a
fine
example
of
a
witbeer
with
a
wild
spicy
fruity
flavor
well
done
overall
excellent
summer
beer
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
two
fingers
of
white
foamy
head
that
retains
well
and
laces
a
ton
the
atoms
is
citrusy
and
spicy
the
flavor
starts
with
a
spiciness
and
then
becomes
tart
with
sweet
citrus
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
clean
an
balanced
overall
a
great
wit
beer
nice
and
smooth
not
as
prickly
as
i
would
have
thought
refreshing
to
the
palate
even
though
its
hot
as
balls
outside
wowie
wow
wow
the
continental
would
approve
colored
like
freshly
squeezed
tangerine
juice
and
it
has
a
thin
offwhite
small
bubbly
head
it
smells
like
canned
peaches
and
rosemary
tastes
like
malty
wine
with
a
dry
finish
it
has
lotsa
stone
fruit
flavors
and
the
rosemary
nose
is
on
the
tongue
some
classic
wit
attributes
of
course
but
something
all
its
own
fantastic
and
im
getting
another
o
has
to
be
the
best
witber
i
have
ever
had
maybe
because
of
the
addition
of
the
funk
yeast
that
adds
the
extra
level
the
2575
is
perfect
anything
more
and
it
would
be
a
little
too
much
o
not
sure
if
id
necessarily
call
this
a
witbier
but
it
was
good
overall
i
really
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
for
the
the
summer
very
refreshing
i
really
like
the
changes
they
made
from
last
years
version
the
added
sourness
although
subtle
its
great
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
a
pretty
light
body
overall
though
no
doubt
helped
by
the
huge
amount
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
a
unique
beer
a
fantastic
summer
beer
very
drinkable
prosit
loved
this
double
wit
and
would
highly
recommend
to
seek
out
and
sample
yum
great
beer
one
of
the
best
yet
from
the
smokestack
series
d
very
very
nice
big
witbier
boulevard
continues
to
impress
and
surprise
with
this
smokestack
series
and
this
lavender
and
spice
is
no
exception
o
with
a
high
abv
that
is
well
hidden
i
would
drink
this
more
often
if
it
was
available
locally
and
more
often
still
if
it
was
in
a
smaller
format
which
takes
it
down
a
bit
in
the
overall
score
for
me
note
i
initially
gave
this
beer
a
2
95
but
after
drinking
about
half
of
the
bottle
the
flavor
and
mouthfeel
got
a
good
bit
easier
to
take
but
the
beer
still
didnt
do
much
to
become
a
drinker
d
to
kick
off
either
the
spring
or
the
fall
few
things
would
be
better
encapsulates
the
best
of
a
belgian
wit
while
retaining
a
fair
bit
of
the
fruity
zestiness
of
their
flagship
unfiltered
wheat
well
done
again
blvd
this
was
subtly
done
and
nice
i
love
the
smokestack
series
drink
most
witbiers
are
small
and
lack
flavor
not
this
one
flavor
came
in
waves
and
was
a
nice
tasting
brew
thanks
to
my
man
dale
for
the
trade
d
extremely
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
and
has
a
nice
strong
and
delicious
spice
character
the
abv
is
high
but
not
too
crazy
d
this
is
a
very
good
brew
overall
abv
is
well
hidden
this
reminds
me
more
of
a
saison
than
an
imperial
witbier
which
is
interesting
since
there
are
several
saisons
in
the
smokestack
series
but
it
definatelt
falls
into
the
pale
belgian
category
well
another
great
brew
by
boulevard
d
pretty
good
for
an
8
beer
goes
down
without
tasting
like
it
but
i
am
feeling
it
near
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
however
the
overpowering
herbal
taste
makes
me
wish
i
had
someone
to
split
the
bottle
with
i
drinkability
was
ok
i
enjoyed
this
high
spiced
beer
so
close
to
the
holiday
decent
sipper
on
cold
winter
night
an
amped
up
wit
with
a
hefty
dose
of
additional
spices
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
more
interesting
versions
of
the
style
ive
had
its
bigger
than
most
though
and
the
burn
actually
limits
the
drinkability
bottle
poured
a
hazy
dirty
beige
color
ale
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
with
super
good
retention
and
some
very
good
lacing
aroma
of
cardamom
and
coriander
is
incredibly
well
balance
with
some
dry
wheat
malt
notes
and
light
fruity
ester
taste
is
also
dominated
by
loads
of
fruity
ester
with
well
balanced
spicing
with
clear
notes
cardamom
and
coriander
wheat
malt
is
solid
without
being
too
sweet
which
is
often
the
case
with
double
wit
another
beautiful
beer
form
boulevard
which
keep
surprising
me
with
the
quality
of
their
offering
tasty
beer
and
something
im
glad
i
tried
but
it
might
be
a
bit
much
for
me
i
think
a
more
traditional
wit
is
more
my
style
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
being
above
average
drinkability
isnt
good
for
me
i
thought
it
was
overly
spiced
and
some
of
the
spices
like
lavender
just
didnt
work
at
all
for
me
d
very
smooth
but
a
bit
on
the
boozy
side
great
beer
really
like
this
interpretation
easy
to
drink
on
a
very
hot
day
in
nc
in
october
mouthfeeldrinkability
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
pretty
full
for
a
witbier
soft
and
creamy
as
well
abv
is
8
but
i
cant
tell
at
all
very
drinkable
beer
from
boulevard
d
once
again
crisp
light
and
refreshing
a
very
enjoyable
brew
but
nothing
to
jump
up
and
down
about
it
was
a
very
tasty
witbier
something
that
goes
great
in
spring
and
summer
months
had
a
refreshing
value
to
it
and
a
lot
of
flavor
drinkability
i
gotta
give
this
brew
some
good
marks
here
its
light
crisp
and
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
most
importantly
its
pretty
tasty
too
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
brew
to
anybody
thanks
again
kevin
its
medium
bodied
spicy
and
dry
strong
coriander
carbonation
is
nice
in
the
mouth
its
drinkability
is
good
mouthfeel
is
ok
i
liked
this
one
quite
a
bit
my
first
double
wit
and
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
this
beer
is
a
joy
to
drink
one
of
the
best
an
excellent
and
unique
tasting
wit
worth
the
price
saw
this
one
on
tap
at
oskar
blues
liquids
and
solids
and
wanted
to
try
this
one
after
really
enjoying
great
divides
double
wit
the
other
day
this
one
was
sadly
not
nearly
as
good
poured
from
the
tap
a
promising
golden
honey
color
with
a
decent
bit
of
foam
decent
herbal
nose
with
coriander
cardamom
and
a
bit
of
orange
peel
similar
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
alcoholic
punch
medium
bodied
high
carbonation
and
easy
to
drink
based
on
what
i
have
tried
so
far
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
any
of
the
beers
in
the
boulevard
smokestack
series
drinkability
an
8
abv
witbier
wow
an
amazing
easydrinking
summer
offering
with
a
big
beer
heft
and
body
i
would
never
have
considered
a
witbier
to
be
a
sipper
this
is
the
second
brew
from
boulevard
that
ive
tried
second
to
saison
brett
this
one
definitely
is
a
very
solid
brew
and
does
not
disappoint
this
is
not
in
the
same
category
as
saison
brett
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
poured
into
glass
and
had
very
good
head
light
coppery
color
the
smell
has
fruity
distinctions
specifically
pear
and
apricot
beer
is
highly
carbonated
and
is
very
fruity
the
bitterness
is
acidic
probably
from
orange
peel
and
as
mentioned
on
the
label
a
lactic
fermentation
no
real
flavor
or
smell
of
hops
noted
no
distinct
flavor
of
sweetness
or
malt
noted
i
wish
there
would
have
been
more
flavorspice
from
corriander
or
malt
sweetness
to
balance
the
bitter
fruit
drinkability
is
good
and
beer
has
slight
warming
character
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
lacks
some
characteristics
that
i
enjoy
in
belgian
wits
d
not
one
that
i
would
finish
the
entire
bottle
but
definitely
would
share
it
with
friends
on
a
hot
oklahoma
summer
day
f
dry
the
spice
flavors
linger
with
lots
of
citrus
fruit
zest
fruit
flavors
belgian
malts
and
yeast
lemon
spices
galore
and
a
slight
creamy
and
juicy
cork
was
almost
impossible
to
get
out
of
the
bottle
drinkability
iis
pretty
high
i
might
even
kill
two
750ml
bottles
in
a
session
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
overall
a
very
nice
beer
certainly
worth
your
time
a
very
nice
beer
that
drinks
decently
this
definitely
drinks
more
like
a
triple
or
a
quad
more
so
than
a
wit
d
here
in
florida
we
need
beer
like
this
superrefreshing
and
still
very
substantial
boulevard

yep
im
feelin
it
but
its
not
too
noticeable
or
in
your
face
despite
the
lack
of
sweetness
to
cover
up
maybe
its
hidden
in
the
spice
this
ones
a
step
above
most
of
the
double
wits
ive
had
most
tend
to
be
sickly
sweet
or
overly
spiced
or
spiced
in
an
inauthentic
way
this
one
keeps
the
yeast
notes
at
bay
and
augment
them
with
authentic
earthy
spices
and
overtones
and
has
a
dry
enough
malt
backbone
that
nothings
cloying
or
overpowering
indeed
its
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
recommended
and
an
exemplary
standout
if
ba
ever
gives
the
doublewit
its
own
style
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
loads
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
the
flavor
is
lemons
oranges
spicy
hops
and
a
lot
of
coriander
some
alcohol
is
present
in
the
flavor
as
well
very
soft
medium
mouthfeel
and
mediumhigh
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
the
alcohol
is
almost
completely
undetectable
in

taste
poured
a
cloudy

and
no

the
aroma

spiciness
was
a

verdict
kind
of
a
wild
card
think
of
two

as
a
strong
witbier
with
some
slightly
sour

i
expected
another

found

a

with
this

the

was
a

perfect
beer
anytime

try

beers
the

compliment

it
straight
from

something

still

i
was
expecting
more
since
ive
really
fallen
for
the
witbier
style
hoegaarden
and
blue
moon
are
two
great
examples
of
what
i
look
for
in
a
belgian
whitewheat
aka
witbier
style
and
in
my
opinion
this
brewerys
take
on
it
is
less
than
satisfactory
there
are
worse
beers
out
there
but
i
think
for
a
belgian
white
this
one
has
been
the
worst
so
far
poured
from
bottle
to
glass
white
head
that
quickly
dissipated
hazy
orange
yellow
appearance
decent
amount
of
carbonation
smells
of
orange
wheat
and
cinnamon
tasted
citrus
sweet
not
bitter
hint
of
spicy
notes
coriander
crisp
finish
overall
average
wheat
ale
flavor
the
grassy
wheat
flavor
leads
the
way
there
is
some
graperaisin
flavor
in
the
finish
a
bit
of
lemon
and
floral
hops
round
out
the
flavor
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brand
before
this
was
a
blind
request
until
checking
in
here
i
had
no
idea
this
was
a
wheat
beer
i
thought
it
was
alaskans
attempt
at
a
north
american
macrobrew
more
quality
than
an
na
macro
though
with
little
pretty
lacing
and
no
purity
of
opacity
presentation
packaged
in
a
stubby
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
sealed
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
average
to
above
average
a
thin
representation
of
the
style
but
otherwise
true
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
so
i
would
give
it
a
try
just
dont
expect
much
tastepalate
there
is
a
big
spicy
clove
and
sweet
lemonyorange
presence
up
front
with
light
wheat
notes
backing
it
up
i
also
get
a
slight
astringent
note
and
some
pale
hop
bitterness
on
the
back
end
this
all
comes
in
a
smooth
feeling
medium
bodied
package
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
it
is
well
carbonated
and
leaves
a
little
film
on
the
tongue
it
is
refreshing
with
a
slightly
dry
finish
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
standard
for
the
style
scents
of
coriander
yeast
wheat
malt
and
slight
orange
peel
again
nothing
fantastic
and
stand
out
but
true
to
style
flavors
of
coriander
wheat
bread
slight
citrus
flavors
with
a
moderate
hop
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
quite
nice
again
true
to
style
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
quite
easy
to
drink
a
good
but
not
spectacular
example
of
a
witbier
better
than
hoegaarden
and
blue
moon
not
as
good
as
allagash
white
still
worth
having
at
least
once
overall
an
average
beer
the
malty
accents
are
probably
the
highlight
light
and
refreshing
nothing
to
go
out
of
your
way
for
though
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
2
finger
width
foamy
head
head
retention
is
mild
lacing
is
moderate
has
a
wheat
aroma
with
banana
maybe
some
orange
peel
seems
a
little
on
the
stale
or
ripened
side
upon
sipping
you
get
a
wheaty
bready
taste
followed
by
a
more
spicy
maybe
cinnamon
banana
flavor
slightly
bitter
more
of
a
mild
banana
aftertaste
but
not
much
substance
this
was
my
first
review
i
apologize
for
its
shittyness
flavors
of
sweet
malts
herbal
medley
rosemary
water
lemongrass
overall
flavorful
with
some
body
and
complexity
but
light
on

hazy
golden

color
with
a
1
finger
foamy
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thin

that
lingers
for

minimal

on
the

aromas
of
pear
coriander
orange
peel
wheat
light
pepper
light
clove
floral
and
yeast
earthiness
ok
aromas
with
decent
balance
and
complexity
but
there
is
not
much
going
on
here
other
than
the
spicing
taste
of
pear
coriander
orange

pepper
light
clove
floral
and
earthy
yeast
spiciness
lingering
notes
of

no
cloying

after
the

medium

and

with
a
smooth
and
fairly
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
zero
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
solid
witbier
solid
balance
of
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
just
really
not
all
that
exciting
enjoyable
stuff
i
immediately
regret
buying
the
pint
glass
before
buying
the
beer
although
decent
enough
as
a
heat
beater
there
is
nothing
memorable
enough
about
this
brew
to
entice
me
to
purchase
it
again
by
far
the
worst
of
the
alaskan
products
i
have
sampled
and
i
suspect
i
would
go
with
the
ubiquitous
golden
colorado
alternative
before
giving
this
another
shot
o
there
is
definitely
some
potential
with
this
flavour
mix
but
it
just
doesnt
quite
go
far
enough
to
make
it
more
than
average
its
not
outstanding
but
its
a
solid
witbier
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
light
golden
amber
thin
fine
white
head
with
good
retention
and
slippery
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
belgian
yeast
wit
spicing
light
orange
very
attenuated
flavor
of
sweet
floral
bready
malt
and
wheat
slight
spicing
flavors
are
all
pleasant
but
this
tastes
almost
watered
down
light
bodied
but
that
is
to
style
this
is
the
biggest
surprise
ive
had
from
alaskan
not
bad
but
very
subdued
the
weakest
flavored
wit
ive
ever
tasted
ill
be
very
satisfied
to
finish
the
bottle
but
will
probably
not
try
again
unfortunately
thin
finish
lets
this
down
a
shame
since
the
flavours
really
appeal
to
me
be
great
in
the
summer
though
however
even
with
that
macro
flavor
profile
it
is
much
more
crisp
and
and
enjoyable
id
definitely
give
this
one
another
try
at
some
point
and
would
not
turn
it
down
especially
with
that
cute
picture
on
it
but
i
dont
know
meh
this
was
enjoyable
good
flavors
and
lots
of
drinkability
o
just
not
good
ive
been
working
through
an
alaskan
12
pack
mixer
and
this
is
the
worst
by
far
can
i
trade
the
other
one
for
another
amber
please
the
drinkability
on
this
is
exceptional
would
make
a
nice
session
beer
other
than
that
nothing
too
special
of
a
beer
but
very
enjoyable
on
this
hot
summer
day
something
i
have
had
on
many
occasions
a
very
nice
wit
an
easy
to
drink
everyday
beer
with
plenty
of
character
something
i
would
recommend
3
5
d
not
the
typical
witbier
but
tasty
nonetheless
lots
of
corriander
which
is
my
favorite
part
of
a
wit
pours
a
cloudy
golden
murky
color
darker
than
most
wits
with
a
nice
white
filmy
head
smells
nice
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
citrus
banana
and
wheat
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
orange
and
banana
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
wheat
it
has
a
medium
body
with
some
soft
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
finish
o
i
am
a
fan
of
abcs
beers
but
this
was
a
huge
disappointment
ahoy
hoy
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
wheat
with
a
hint
of
coriander
thrown
in
the
flavor
has
quite
a
bit
more
orange
peel
in
it
as
well
as
some
coriander
and
wheat
overall
this
is
a
basic
belgian
white
with
well
balanced
notes
and
easy
drinkability
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
overall
an
average
witbier
fairly
basic
would
buy
again
if
options
were
limited
but
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
other
witbiers
id
rather
have
o
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
in
texas
not
amazing
but
worth
the
try
i
would
go
for
a
hoegarden
overall
i
would
say
this
is
the
best
alaskan
beer
ive
had
yet
much
better
than
the
amber
o
not
the
best
example
of
a
traditional
witbier
just
barely
a
step
up
than
the
us
macro
versions
overall
its
a
nice
summer
session
beer
but
not
a
good
example
of
a
witbier
pretty
standard
white
beer
here
pours
an
only
slightly
cloudy
blonde
color
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
spiced
or
herbed
with
fruity
yeast
and
plenty
of
sweetness
taste
for
me
was
too
sweet
lots
of
sugars
in
there
can
taste
the
coriander
and
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
back
end
feel
is
nice
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
fairly
light
body
it
gets
bogged
down
by
its
sweetness
in
my
opinion
but
the
flavor
profile
under
all
that
is
quite
nice
not
my
favorite
beer
from
these
guys
though
it
is
ok
but
just
a
bit
weakwatery
although
pretty
average
i
found
this
to
be
the
right
beer
at
the
right
time
on
a
very
warm
and
windy
midmarch
day
here
in
the
northland
after
a
day
of
doing
yardwork
instead
of
fighting
floods
and
snowstorms
this
hit
the
spot
on
a
glorious
late
winterearly
spring
day
compared
pretty
much
side
by
side
with
the
wheat
monkey
both
beers
were
pretty
unimpressive
not
much
belgian
quality
here
more
of
a
weak
american
wheat
ale
with
a
grain
bill
that
darkens
the
bright
wheat
flavor
and
basic
spices
would
not
revisit
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
of
sweet
wheat
and
some
subtle
spice
flavors
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
witbier
that
is
easy
to
drink
ontap
at
old
chicagos
served
to
a
pint
glass
the
beer
arrives
a
hazy
pale
amber
color
light
in
color
with
a
12
finger
white
cap
some
retention
and
lacing
throughout
the
nose
is
sweet
and
contains
hints
of
fruity
spice
such
as
coriander
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
and
wheat
the
flavor
very
much
follows
suit
with
a
malty
wheat
sweetness
hints
of
lemons
orange
and
coriander
spice
mildly
bitter
creamy
in
nature
lingers
with
hints
of
spicy
sweetness
and
fruit
wheat
flavor
is
strong
though
perhaps
a
little
much
so
good
carbonation
and
lighter
mouthfeel
overall
not
the
best
witbier
but
not
bad
at
all
very
drinkable
o
ljght
crisp
and
spicy
for
a
wheat
not
bad
just
enough
hops
for
me
just
enough
pretty
fruit
and
spice
but
cant
ever
imagine
having
more
than
one
but
heres
to
those
that
will
yea
this
ones
only
accepting
applications
from
big
fans
of
coriander
fluffy
wheat
base
and
the
coriander
give
it
a
sweet
feel
to
it
and
a
hefty
body
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
i
could
easily
chug
the
whole
glass
in
one
or
two
sips
i
am
surprised
at
the
fairly
low
scores
for
this
one
i
am
enjoying
the
shit
out
of
it
alaskan
has
one
of
the
most
solid
regular
lineups
of
any
brewery
in
the
country
in
my
opinion
love
their
beers
o
this
is
a
very
nice
witbier
yet
another
solid
offering
from
alaskan
brewing
d
subtly
complex
and
highly
sessionable
i
will
reach
for
this
one
again
c
oa
boring
beer
not
much
to
write
home
about
saving
grace
would
be
that
you
can
throw
a
few
back
if
you
ever
wanted
to
o
its
mildly
enjoyable
and
definitely
drinkable
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
readily
available
beers
i
enjoy
more
had
this
served
at
a
good
temperature
with
a
small
rapidly
vanished
off
white
head
and
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
amber
with
lots
of
bubble
trails
aroma
is
beery
yeast
spice
malt
grass
flavor
is
like
nose
and
is
dominated
by
carbonic
tang
and
yeast
followed
by
malt
and
a
little
spice
barest
hint
of
orange
maybe
im
even
imagining
it
body
is
ok
but
carbonation
is
very
fizzy
finish
is
like
flavor
fairly
short
and
forgettable
i
was
really
excited
to
learn
that
wi
was
going
to
get
some
beer
distributed
from
alaska
it
seemed
so
exotic
so
far
away
poured
out
a
translucent
darker
gold
color
one
finger
of
foam
that
dissipated
in
about
a
minute
no
real
lacing
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
head
than
this
thinner
bodied
but
effervescent
like
a
soda
with
the
level
of
carbonation
present
smells
of
light
grains
and
orange
zest
with
some
minor
murky
floral
hop
undertones
taste
follows
the
nose
to
a
t
but
i
failed
to
detect
as
much
complexity
as
i
have
had
in
other
witbiers
i
cant
find
any
coriander
any
tartness
or
spice
hopefully
alaskan
brewings
other
offerings
are
better
than
this
was
onice
easy
drinking
white
not
as
sweet
as
most
american
witbiers
nothing
outstanding
about
this
beerjust
a
solid
drinking
beer
that
i
will
be
glad
to
have
more
of
drinkability
very
light
and
thin
and
the
typical
subtle
flavors
and
spices
of
the
witbier
style
are
overpowered
by
the
hops
in
this
one
not
a
great
example
of
the
style
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
not
impressed
overall
especially
since
my
only
other
alaskan
beer
thusfar
was
the
smoked
porter
a
step
up
from
bmc
lager
types
but
besides
that
dont
waste
your
timemoney
o
enjoyable
sweet
but
not
syrupy
or
overpowering
in
total
a
decent
beer
but
lacks
the
fruitiness
and
zestiness
that
i
desire
i
also
pick
up
diacetyl
which
i
find
offputting
overall
a
fairly
straightforward
wit
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
easy
drinking
o
this
wit
has
no
balance
too
much
orange
peel
no
yeast
character
no
coriander
its
better
then
blue
moon
but
not
much
t
its
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
wit
the
coriander
and
orange
are
definitely
there
but
it
just
feels
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
owell
the
tastes
arent
amazing
but
its
extremely
drinkable
and
tasty
nonetheless
its
something
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
all
nght
on
any
night
of
the
week
o
another
reasonable
crisp
quaffable
summer
sessionable
beer
and
very
low
priced
for
a
single
though
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
i
would
accept
if
passed
to
me
o
not
bad
since
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
not
the
most
drinkable
by
any
means
very
drinkable
this
was
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
sunny
afternoon
at
the
tiki
bar
poolside
wish
i
could
get
it
around
here
light
bodied
average
carbonation
crisp
smooth
and
clean
i
can
see
drinking
this
beer
over
and
over
during
the
summer
months
overall
a
very
tasty
and
interesting
take
on
a
witbier
i
really
like
the
coconut
finish
it
makes
this
beer
stand
out
to
me
among
other
american
versions
of
this
style
murky
pale
yellow
thin
white
head
lacing
is
moderate
aroma
is
very
fragrant
and
fresh
great
corriander
notes
with
a
little
orange
zest
coming
through
as
well
flavor
is
very
well
received
nice
wheat
base
with
great
spicing
accenting
freshly
crushed
corriander
lemon
orange
very
refreshing
a
flavorful
one
of
the
better
wits
ive
run
across
lingering
dryness
begs
another
sip
moderate
to
moderately
high
carbonation
great
wit
overall
overall
this
has
a
nice
orangelike
flavor
but
it
isnt
really
a
wit
as
it
lacks
belgian
yeast
and
the
crisp
dryness
i
expect
more
like
an
american
wheat
with
loads
of
orange
certainly
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
i
have
little
desire
to
have
it
again
overall
not
a
bad
brew
in
general
but
also
not
terribly
complex
although
still
interesting
to
taste
would
go
well
with
a
thai
meal
or
something
like
that
o
its
tasty
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
good
hint
of
citrus
malts
and
spices
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
orange
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
oranges
with
a
hint
of
coriander
it
is
rather
weak
for
the
style
the
taste
is
a
little
fuller
and
more
spicy
than
the
aroma
there
is
coriander
cardamom
and
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
chewy
texture
overall
this
is
a
decent
witbier
that
i
would
drink
again
i
just
wish
the
aroma
werent
so
airy
overall
a
very
solid
little
ale
and
one
that
i
needed
to
take
a
break
from
the
rest
of
the
evening
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
64
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
sweet
malt
slight
floral
slight
pale
malt
slight
spice
and
a
hint
of
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
slight
hop
hint
of
spice
slight
pale
malt
and
hint
of
citrus
overall
good
appearance
feel
and
blend
the
body
is
lacking
even
for
a
witbier
overall
this
one
was
great
but
since
the
day
extremely
cold
i
would
rather
drink
ipas
barley
wines
or
even
winter
ales
that
go
more
with
the
weather
would
love
to
try
more
from
the
alaskan
brewing
co
because
their
2
beers
i
had
were
as
for
sure
going
to
look
for
their
beers
in
bottle
when
i
get
a
chance
a
drinkable
enough
beer
that
will
probably
be
better
when
you
need
to
change
up
styles
hot
day
girlfriend
beer
etc
alaskan
has
done
better
to
me
in
the
past
and
i
wont
let
this
one
turn
me
off
of
a
solid
brewery
but
i
say
pass
on
the
alaskan
white
o
very
drinkable
which
is
nice
but
the
craftsmanship
above
average
and
balanced
but
not
unique
to
bold
could
drink
quite
a
bit
which
is
nice
but
not
a
stand
out
beer
the
beer
looks
like
blue
moon
that
is
to
say
like
a
pale
wheat
ale
and
has
a
similar
aroma
but
with
a
touch
more
malt
and
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
taste
was
fairly
light
and
i
couldnt
really
get
into
it
not
much
here
made
me
wonder
if
they
actually
just
had
a
tap
running
from
the
blue
moon
keg
which
in
all
honesty
judging
from
the
kind
of
place
this
was
they
might
have
ill
take
their
word
for
it
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
definitely
drinkable
and
washed
bar
food
down
well
burgers
and
wings
but
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
wit
disappointed
as
alaskan
is
usually
excellent
this
one
was
just
meh
i
dig
spiced
witbiers
like
this
so
i
figured
i
would
give
alaskans
version
a
shot
i
find
it
to
be
adequate
but
nothing
compared
to
other
spiced
beer
like
albino
python
or
witchs
wit
pours
nice
has
tons
of
carbonation
but
flavors
seem
muted
i
dont
get
the
sense
of
earthiness
or
fragrance
like
other
wits
i
would
only
do
one
of
these
at
a
time
because
i
wasnt
a
big
fan
of
how
it
would
taste
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
d
not
impressed
i
wont
be
having
another
one
of
these
disappointing
compared
to
quality
of
the
other
alaskan
brews
ive
had
this
was
a
very
disappointing
beer
for
me
i
expected
much
more
i
didnt
get
much
head
much
lacing
or
anything
really
that
impressive
appearance
wise
the
smell
and
taste
were
just
the
same
i
got
very
little
spice
notes
and
no
fruit
i
assume
most
witbiers
should
have
some
fruit
in
them
maybe
this
one
wasnt
supposed
to
i
dunno
but
either
way
very
little
spice
in
this
and
very
little
wheat
there
isnt
much
i
hate
more
than
a
small
amount
of
wheat
in
a
beer
it
honestly
just
felt
like
a
watered
down
beer
to
me
i
could
tell
they
obviously
didnt
water
down
the
beer
to
save
money
that
would
have
tasted
terrible
but
i
just
got
that
feeling
not
much
taste
not
much
anything
oh
well
it
wasnt
undrinkable
just
not
that
great
at
all
poured
a
hazy
yellowishgold
with
a
light
bubbly
head
typical
citrusy
nose
of
a
wheat
beer
taste
was
citrusy
crisp
tart
and
a
bit
acidic
lightmedium
mouthfeel
some
carbonation
a
little
rough
going
down
somewhat
drinkable
and
refreshing
but
nothing
extraordinary
plus
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
so
it
takes
a
little
more
to
get
me
to
come
back
while
this
brew
is
rather
easy
to
drink
it
most
certainly
borders
on
average
at
least
until
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
stop
trying
to
beat
everything
else
up
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
beer
is
just
short
of
the
depth
and
complexity
and
missing
a
certain
light
fruitiness
that
is
supposedly
common
in
the
witbier
style
with
all
of
the
spices
overshadowing
everything
this
almost
tastes
like
it
wants
to
be
a
holidaytype
drink
and
would
probably
be
best
enjoyed
paired
with
a
salad
covered
in
rosemary
vinaigrette
or
lemon
and
a
white
fish
i
ended
up
seeing
this
in
the
store
and
brought
home
a
sixpack
not
as
good
in
the
bottle
sitting
in
long
beach
as
it
is
from
the
tap
in
alaska
but
still
a
beer
that
ill
buy
on
occassion
its
a
redo
in
my
book
kind
of
disappointing
not
one
ill
be
reaching
for
again
one
of
the
strangest
witbiers
that
ive
come
across
and
very
difficult
to
describe
in
detail
almost
medicinal
in
its
initial
sweetness
hmmm
not
something
i
would
want
to
pursue
this
is
a
very
nice
light
beer
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
but
im
not
really
sure
if
i
would
call
it
a
witbier
american
summer
wheat
perhaps
but
lacking
some
of
the
dimension
i
expect
in
a
nice
witbier
good
drinking
but
lacking
character
for
the
style
with
that
in
mind
alaskan
white
might
be
good
while
grilling
outdoors
or
if
youre
looking
for
a
small
beer
but
there
are
tens
of
better
tasting
wits
on
the
markets
pours
quite
dark
for
a
wit
more
toward
the
amber
side
of
the
spectrum
than
the
pale
golden
or
cloudy
white
youd
expect
the
tight
head
fades
in
fairly
short
order
to
a
thin
rim
smells
of
coriander
and
dusky
bitter
orange
with
some
wheat
notes
in
the
background
the
taste
is
similar
with
a
peculiar
herbal
bitterness
which
is
not
from
hops
the
bitter
orange
lingers
as
well
and
makes
it
quite
citrusy
in
that
dried
peel
kind
of
way
id
say
there
is
simply
too
much
coriander
and
orange
here
and
it
kind
of
makes
the
beer
out
of
whack
it
also
lacks
that
zingy
crispness
that
makes
the
style
so
pleasant
and
thirst
quenching
just
okay
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
summer
time
beer
not
the
best
wit
out
there
but
its
drinkable
and
sessionable
i
like
this
one
a
very
nice
product
overall
perhaps
this
should
be
called
american
wheat
not
a
white
its
filtered
and
spice
is
light
and
yeast
is
probably
not
a
white
beer
yeast
its
just
a
house
ale
yeast
they
might
solve
a
ton
of
problems
if
they
changed
the
yeast
d
this
beer
isnt
all
that
great
would
i
want
to
drink
another
one
no
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
am
surprised
by
how
dark
it
is
for
a
white
beer
medium
golden
blond
with
a
bit
of
white
foam
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
on
the
nose
i
get
some
belgian
yeast
banana
some
wheat
and
a
little
peppery
spice
very
fruity
on
the
palate
a
little
lemon
some
apricot
and
maybe
pearapple
very
dissimilar
to
most
whites
ive
had
but
refreshing
and
flavorful
md
light
feel
with
lots
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
but
the
taste
seems
off
for
a
witbier
and
seemed
harsh
i
wasnt
going
into
this
with
high
expectations
but
i
was
pretty
impressed
the
appearance
is
a
cleargolden
with
a
big
head
that
disappears
fast
i
smell
spices
and
some
peppery
notes
slight
sweetness
on
the
nose
as
well
interesting
taste
to
this
wheat
beer
the
wheat
hits
you
in
the
face
right
away
this
beer
blows
blue
moon
outta
the
water
lots
of
spice
and
very
little
hops
with
a
nice
aftertaste
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
as
a
6
pack
for
a
nice
summer
bbq
session
beer
taste
sweetens
as
it
warms
and
holds
a
firm
spiced
character
revealing
a
bit
of
citrus
amongst
a
dense
wheat
feel
and
while
the
wheat
is
detected
in
the
feel
it
is
a
bit
difficult
to
discern
in
flavor
a
unique
brew
that
is
dry
in
a
spice
sense
yet
without
being
bitter
and
offers
a
flash
of
citrus
on
the
finish
im
not
quite
sold
on
it
however
as
i
find
it
too
chalky
in
structure
and
with
subtle
wheat
notes
overwhelmed
easy
to
drink
good
summer
beer
not
quite
to
style
but
still
pretty
good
overall
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
disappointment
i
am
a
fan
of
alaska
the
state
and
my
favorite
animal
is
the
bear
i
have
also
recently
tried
other
whites
and
hoped
this
would
be
the
sleeper
and
slot
in
maybe
2nd
place
however
i
did
not
like
the
taste
it
had
and
that
is
a
deal
killer
despite
the
nice
smell
and
agreeable
mouthfeel
overall
a
middleofthe
road
wit
that
while
drinkable
just
doesnt
stand
out
mild
recommend
if
you
can
easily
get
rotation
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
to
myself
from
co
if
here
maybe
the
occasional
6
pack
in
my
wit
rotation
for
now
not
worth
shipping
more
but
would
try
ontap
at
least
once
while
on
the
road
oo
appearance
has
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
bubbling
up
feeding
a
crisp
white
head
smell
of
wheat
and
light
spice
and
faint
citrus
taste
has
a
light
sweet
spiced
wheat
flavor
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
drinkable
brew
but
one
i
wont
pay
for
again
in
awhile
i
think
this
brew
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
some
more
intense
spicing
lighter
carbonation
a
heavier
body
and
a
less
filtered
appearance
would
be
required
for
the
alaskan
white
to
stack
up
to
its
competition
im
certainly
fortunate
to
have
been
able
to
sample
an
alaskan
brewing
co
beer
considering
it
isnt
readily
available
out
this
way
but
this
one
needs
a
little
work
d
relatively
high
given
the
very
mild
flavors
and
fairly
low
abv
not
that
you
might
really
enjoy
every
moment
of
it
light
golden
body
a
bit
of
chill
haze
cleared
up
for
the
most
part
as
it
warmed
1
finger
white
head
medium

is

the
orange

with
a
bit
of
lemon
meyer
lemon
some

notes
coriander
with
a
bit
of

the
taste
is
unfortunately
off
citrus
prominent
but
overwhelmed
by
coriander
worse
yet
is
this
aggressive
banana
tasteis
this
a
bad
keg
big
diacytel
hitugh
a
bit
of
hoppiness
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
this
would
certainly
be
tres
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
wonder
what
this
is
doing
being
served
in
winter
time
ok
but
not
in
the
league
of
allagash
or
hoegaarden
disappointing
the
color
when
poured
was
a
medium
amber
brown
with
very
little
foam
but
did
have
a
lot
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
whole
time
the
smell
of
spice
and
mild
hops
had
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
was
of
spices
mild
hops
and
a
hint
of
malts
and
yeast
as
in
bread
taste
a
very
nicely
balance
of
components
without
the
bittness
drink
and
enjoy
this
white
ale
for
alaska
i
was
disappointed
by
this
beer
as
i
have
really
enjoyed
the
other
offerings
i
have
tried
by
this
brewery
but
this
just
reminded
me
too
much
of
an
adjunct
lager
to
be
enjoyable
like
most
of
alaskan
brewing
co
beers
alaskan
white
is
built
for
easy
drinking
alaskan
has
better
offerings
d
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
it
has
a
good
taste
thats
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
picking
up
to
try
sometime
doverall
enjoyable
beer
definitely
drinkable
d
sure
its
not
crazy
complex
for
the
style
or
anything
but
it
is
a
decent
representation
for
sure
this
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
it
could
have
a
bit
more
going
for
it
but
wits
are
very
touchy
and
easy
to
screw
up
in
my
experience
with
that
said
i
would
absolutely
have
this
brew
again
especially
during
the
summer
months
tasty
and
enjoyable
d
very
drinkable
and
a
good
summer
beer
a
good
thirst
quencher
a
very
occasional
beer
drinker
would
probably
love
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
it
could
be
a
great
icecold
session
beer
d
this
is
an
ok
wit
in
my
book
the
light
body
and
low
abv
make
it
an
easy
drinker
not
necessarily
a
beer
im
anxious
to
revisit
a
nicely
balanced
thirstquencher
a
enjoyable
witbier
quite
drinkable
but
this
just
isnt
a
good
example
of
the
beer
style
try
once
and
forget
alaskan
brewing
company
kicks
out
some
pretty
amazing
beer
a
significant
chunk
of
their
lineup
however
is
merely
better
than
average
summer
ale
winter
ale
pale
amber
and
now
white
fall
into
that
category
there
are
better
wits
out
there
for
your
drinking
pleasure
d
usually
i
like
my
wits
to
have
a
little
more
orangefruit
flavours
in
them
this
one
was
a
little
to
spicy
and
dry
for
me
almost
like
a
mix
of
an
apwa
and
a
wit
just
average
1157
overall
impression
not
the
most
interesting
beer
but
its
drinkable
and
has
some
decent
flavors
drinkability
its
more
of
a
warmweather
beer
but
drinkability
is
ok
drinkability
i
had
2
16
oz
pints
back
to
back4
each
and
they
went
down
easily
enough
good
brew
basically
i
expected
a
witbier
but
got
an
american
wheat
ale
w
some
spices
the
body
was
light
and
smooth
almost
average
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
why
bother
drink
this
if
your
only
other
options
are
the
bmc
suspects
otherwise
avoid
it
if
you
really
like
belgian
wits
this
should
appeal
to
you
having
said
that
this
is
actually
pretty
lackluster
within
the
style
it
is
refreshing
and
quaffable
and
certainly
hits
the
spot
on
a
110ºf
44ºc
day
but
it
is
really
lacking
in
depth
and
complexity
it
is
especially
missing
the
fermentation
yeast
derived
character
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
dry
carbonated
and
astringent
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
is
just
okay
i
feel
it
really
lacks
flavor
and
complexity
of
a
good
witbier
it
had
some
odd
astringent
note
from
the
hops
that
clashed
with
the
spice
added
to
the
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
good
summer
beer
a
good
thirst
quencher
and
it
could
easily
be
served
ice
cold
without
losing
much
of
the
flavor
this
beer
is
primarily
noteworthy
for
its
bland
drinkability
it
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
the
way
that
hundreds
of
run
of
the
mill
lawnmower
beers
do
not
awful
but
in
no
way
memorable
enough
for
me
to
bother
with
seeking
out
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
u
s
wit
ill
grab
a
zon
from
boulevard
a
nice
drinkable
summer
session
beer
but
not
a
lot
else
going
on
to
keep
my
interest
overall
not
very
powerful
in
the
flavor
and
aroma
department
its
an
average
ale
but
nothing
special
nose
has
a
small
amount
of
spicy
cardamom
with
some
gentle
tangy
wheat
taste
pretty
much
follows
the
nose
perhaps
with
more
of
the
wheat
character
decent
beer
overall
but
could
use
a
little
kick
in
the
pants
other
comments
not
a
challenger
to
the
belgian
wits
or
the
more
notable
american
versions
but
quite
drinkable
and
refreshing
nonetheless
pours
a

alaskan

an
easy
one
to
nail
down
this
beer
gets
the
delicate
spices
right
corriander
and
curraco
orange
peel
set
the
stage
for
a
silky
and
spicy
beer
set
atop
a
firm
malt
base
of
wheat
and
pilsner
malts
the
yeasty
phenols
swirl
around
the
peppery
corriander
and
citrusy
orange
peel
notes
at
times
the
spices
seem
to
dominated
with
a
shakey
wheat
character
wheat
malts
seem
to
give
away
some
body
and
allow
the
acidity
and
minerally
character
to
compromise
the
mouthfeel
the
winter
wheat
and
oat
additions
common
to
belgian
varieties
dont
seem
to
make
the
impact
here
that
is
needed
still
a
quality
beer
to
enjoy
during
those
hot
alaskan
days
wait
what
thanks
clvand0
drinkability
is
just
above
average
but
i
still
find
it
to
be
to
spiced
for
my
liking
and
would
prefer
more
fruit
notes
from
the
esters
although
they
definitely
started
to
open
up
as
it
warmed
i
just
dont
care
for
the
bite
that
coriander
provides
this
kind
of
reminds
me
of
new
belgium
sunshine
wheat
very
light
clean
with
touch
of
orange
it
really
doesnt
do
much
for
me
though
i
would
drink
it
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
or
better
yet
buy
something
tastier
drinkability
certainly
a
fine
choice
from
the
bulk
of
mainstream
us
microbrews
makes
for
a
good
springsummer
brew
a
good
stab
at
the
style
the
playing
field
for
this
style
has
become
a
bit
crowded
these
days
though
this
one
does
a
good
job
of
standing
out
from
most
palate
has
a
wheat
malt
focus
up
front
to
midway
through
some
pleasant
fruity
flavors
dash
of
sourness
and
disappointing
on
the
finish
d
this
one
is
very
easy
to
drink
i
think
it
is
an
excellent
addition
to
the
lineup
of
beers
alaskan
brewing
is
putting
out
this
would
make
for
a
great
summer
time
bbq
session
brew
drinkability
is
also
ok
a
decent
wit
this
has
pleasant
flavors
and
is
easy
to
drink
but
it
needs
some
more
complexity
and
a
better
body
to
be
a
really
good
one
overall
an
okay
wit
a
little
light
on
the
smell
and
a
little
on
the
watery
side
overall
a
very
good
witbier
very
tasty
and
refreshing
for
a
warm
day
definitely
give
this
one
a
try
uplifting
spritsy
taste
almost
like
champagne
the
classic
wheat
beer
there
is
a
reason
this
is
the
standard
for
the
style
almost
no
better
beer
for
warm
weather
effervescent
cloudy
slightly
spicy
phenols
from
the
yeast
and
coriander
and
orange
peel
refreshing
with
a
capital
r
great
beer
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
cant
wait
for
summer
almost
perfect
beer
from
maine
the
head
on
this
beer
is
so
dense
its
reminiscent
of
latte
foam
the
smell
and
lingering
taste
of
coriander
and
orange
make
it
very
enjoyable
to
sit
savor
and
enjoy
overall
as
a
beer
i
wouldnt
say
its
amazing
but
it
sure
is
for
the
style
thus
the
reason
for
my
fairly
high
rating
its
bright
and
effervescent
smooth
and
refreshing
yet
somewhat
full
it
really
could
be
the
benchmark
for
an
american
made
witbier
light
refreshing
and
lightly
spicy
good

mild

one
of
my
favorite
american
beers
and
a
masterpiece
of
the
white
beer
style
overall
a
good
witbier
solid
in
every
aspect
im
a
fan
one
of
the
best
out
there
try
to
get
on
draft
if
you
can
find
it
not
a
fan
of
witbiers
and
this
was
no
exception
tastes
a
little
bitter
similar
to
other
belgium
wheat
beers
great
white
ale
perfect
any
time
of
year
overall
a
classic
brew
an
interesting
take
on
a
classic
style
the
added
spices
enhance
the
yeast
flavors
rather
than
detract
love
it
very
refreshing
as
well
had
this
on
tap
in
philly
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
on
tap
i
didnt
think
bottled
version
was
as
aromatic
amazing
the
perfect
example
of
an
american
brewed
belgian
wheat
beer
nice
golden
color
smells
a
sweet
pungent
aroma
but
the
taste
is
not
as
strong
as
the
scent
and
i
enjoyed
that
i
expected
it
to
have
a
higher
abv
than
5
1
but
that
doesnt
effect
it
at
all
coriander
lemonade
and
banana
with
bitter
hints
and
a
little
pepper
in
the
end
very
well
balanced
refreshing
excellent
witbier
with
a
clean
ending
very
good
beer
i
got
the
four
pack
and
loved
every
bit
of
it
so
good
probably
the
best
belgium
white
i
have
ever
tasted
my
roomate
the
was
a
hard
beer
to
review
for
me
because
i
havent
had
any
in
this
style
in
quite
some
time
it
was
a
very
pale
and
cloudy
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
clinged
too
the
pint
glass
as
i
drank
it
very
mild
aromas
mild
fruit
and
floral
hints
not
what
i
would
describe
as
fruity
and
blended
flavors
very
good
feel
finishes
with
a
low
level
hop
bitter
that
fades
quickly
crisp
and
light
could
easily
drink
these
in
multiples
this
is
my
favorite
white
beer
so
far
great
refresher
in
the
summer
or
after
a
hard
day
at
work
the
spices
in
this
are
unlike
any
other
white
beer
i
have
had
this
is
a
beer
almost
everyone
can
enjoy
citrusy
and
spice
like
notes
with
a
light
body
very
good
overall
just
a
really
solid
american
witte
really
refeshing
solid
beer
mouth
feel
was
somewhat
champagnelike
though
i
only
noticed
after
my
wife
mentioned
it
so
perhaps
it
was
just
power
of
suggestion
poured
in
to
a
tall
decorative
tulip
glass
the
foam
reaches
3
fingers
high
with
a
rocky
white
top
exceptional
lacing
adorns
this
straw
yellow
wit
a
fitting
touch
for
such
a
good
looking
brew
it
is
remarkably
hazy
totally
opaque
in
spite
of
the
pale
color
the
scent
is
intoxicating
rivaling
some
of
its
finest
german
and
belgian
brethren
bananalike
esters
coriander
and
clove
play
against
a
sourdough
bread
bouquet
very
mildly
sweet
with
flavors
of
banana
candy
peppered
clove
and
some
tart
lemon
citrus
on
the
back
end
grains
of
wheat
orange
citrus
and
some
tangy
dry
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
surprisingly
creamy
due
to
the
zesty
carbonation
and
unfiltered
goodness
however
the
body
is
moderate
so
it
remains
refreshing
this
one
went
down
in
record
time
its
just
fantastic
wits
are
typically
not
my
proverbial
cup
of
tea
but
this
one
holds
its
own
against
any
style
it
remains
true
to
form
while
imparting
its
own
distinct
character
i
love
to
come
back
to
this
after
some
hearty
double
stouts
or
rich
porters
to
remind
myself
that
bold
flavor
comes
in
many
forms
if
youre
in
to
wheat
beers
at
all
you
have
to
try
this
if
youre
not
you
still
have
to
try
this
a
classic
one
of
the
first
beers
i
got
into
to
veer
further
into
craft
territory
and
one
i
recommend
to
many
others
coming
into
it
hazy
unfiltered
on
the
pour
with
a
creamy
head
lemon
and
fresh
cut
grass
on
the
nose
with
a
tangy
lemon
curd
feel
on
the
backend
if
youre
skeptical
of
belgians
try
this
wit
bready
deliciousness
on
tap
at
le
belvedere
in
newport
vt
hazy
orangeyellow
with
a
finger
of
pure
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
citrus
and
spice
in
aroma
and
taste
slightly
thin
mouth
overall
and
enjoyable
but
not
exceptional
wheat
beer
classic
tasty
brew
slightly
sour
taste
as
an
honest
ode
to
the
german
hefeweizen
good
spiced
flavor
good
body
this
is
my
goto
beer
clear
light
amber
hues
light
inviting
bubbles
beautiful
and
peaked
head
pour
after
pour
every
time
overall
very
polished
belgian
wheat
beer
feels
light
but
still
has
substantial
flavors
overall
this
beer
is
very
good
and
definitely
recommended
for
others
especially
if
youre
looking
for
something
light
that
isnt
hoppy
the
beer
is
very
refrshing
and
makes
for
a
good
midafternoon
break
very
good
a
classic
a
goto
session
beer
for
easy
drinking
for
those
who
arent
into
drinking
10
bombs
or
for
those
who
arent
into
crazy
and
unexpected
flavors
love
this
outstanding
beer
the
allagash
white
lacks
a
bit
of
the
carmel
flavor
that
i
love
in
other
beers
and
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
amazing
brew
3950
great
light
beer
being
a
fan
of
wheat
beer
i
bought
this
hoping
it
lived
up
to
the
hype
and
it
definitely
did
a
must
have
for
those
who
like
a
great
wheat
beer
nawt
bad
great
witbier
and
one
that
really
exemplifies
the
style
this
is
a
heavily
spiced
beer
the
spices
are
easily
the
most
dominant
part
of
the
flavor
in
this
one
its
not
bad
but
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
would
recommend
pours
a
light
honey
and
blond
color
with
little
head
but
good
retention
that
remains
as
a
thin
white
lace
throughout
look
is
also
hazy
fruity
smell
that
reminds
me
of
peaches
taste
is
malty
spicy
fruity
bready
with
a
very
smooth
finish
there
is
little
to
no
hops
bitterness
feel
is
light
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
crisp
and
refreshing
a
very
fine
wheat
beer
that
i
will
definitely
buy
again
my
personal
favorite
beer
very
sessional
can
be
paired
with
basic
ally
any
type
of
food
great
flavor
and
body
serving
type
bottle
a
very
smooth
drink
and
easy
to
find
around
the
area
overall
have
had
this
a
few
times
and
have
enjoyed
it
a
lot
both
on
its
own
and
paired
with
some
clams
wish
we
could
get
it
in
mn
we
need
more
good
wits
overall
3
88
its
not
the
world
class
beer
i
was
expecting
that
title
still
goes
to
hoegaarden
this
is
a
worthy
option
though
and
as
ive
said
before
ill
never
turn
down
a
wit
unless
its
wasatchs
offering
this
one
is
different
from
the
fold
in
that
its
drier
on
the
finish
and
it
has
some
negative
tin
and
biscuit
flavors
roaming
around
in
there
overall
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
to
enjoy
in
pleasure
one
of
my
absolute
favorites
pours
a
hazy
orange
yellow
with
a
thick
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
full
of
sweet
fruits
like
banana
and
toasted
bread
the
taste
is
great
with
a
lot
of
herb
flavors
mixing
with
the
more
traditional
staples
i
always
find
this
beer
to
be
refreshing
and
very
tasty
drinkability
easy
to
drink
not
heavy
great
beer
a
solid
drinkable
witbier
perfect
for
any
summer
day
o
ive
been
enjoying
this
beer
for
quite
a
few
years
now
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
i
had
never
reviewed
it
as
i
stated
above
this
is
an
amazing
basically
textbook
example
of
a
belgian
witbier
and
shouldnt
be
missed
by
anyone
interested
in
the
style
perhaps
the
only
thing
missing
is
a
touch
of
honey
flavor
that
would
make
it
perfect
in
my
opinion
o
a
great
beer
and
an
excellent
white
beer
traditional
quintessential
yet
distinct
nice
medium
body
and
above
average
carbonation
creamy
smooth
o
nice
complexity
here
piney
finish
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
since
the
pine
note
is
different
than
most
hefs
that
i
have
drank
pine
works
well
with
the
banana
and
clove
flavors
throughly
enjoyed
this
beer
4
255
hard
to
find
any
faults
here
light
in
its
appearance
but
full
of
flavor
a
classic
wheat
beer
been
drinking
for
years
but
lately
it
doesnt
taste
the
same
has
a
peppery
aftertaste
and
its
a
real
turn
off
on
tap
at
whole
foods
in
schaumburg
maybe
that
is
the
extra
5
but
is
sure
was
good
while
my
wife
was
shopping
overall
probably
the
best
witbier
ive
had
very
refreshing
with
light
body
and
good
carb
plus
notes
of
citrus
savory
enough
to
be
enjoyed
yearround
worth
more
than
these
words
overall
another
great
ale
from
allagash
actually
prefer
to
some
of
belgiums
t
considerably
more
complex
than
the
aroma
suggests
banana
and
cloves
floral
hops
scant
lemongrass
tartness
white
pepper
and
coriander
spicing
orange
pith
gives
it
a
dry
and
tart
character
on
the
finish
slight
metallic
but
a
definite
medicinal
character
builds
as
well
o
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
craft
back
in
the
day
over
the
years
this
hasnt
changed
and
is
still
just
as
good
today
overall
all
just
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
to
me
looks
great
smells
and
tastes
phenomenal
and
is
really
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
thanks
to
treyliff
for
this
one
beer
appearance
is
a
vibrant
gold
indicative
of
a
white
beer
foam
forms
a
good
head
during
pouring
you
can
smell
some
fruity
aromas
coming
from
the
beer
during
the
first
sips
its
a
medium
to
light
bodied
beer
with
an
aftertaste
of
signature
belgian
yeast
to
cut
the
story
short
if
you
want
a
belgian
beer
and
its
too
hot
to
enjoy
a
darker
beer
then
the
allagash
white
is
an
excellent
choice
very
refreshing
drinkable
beer
the
finish
is
drier
than
i
prefer
for
a
belgian
but
it
beats
a
heineken
any
day
o
very
unique
really
like
this
beer
love
the
salt
and
pepper
quality
light
and
fresh
and
definitely
great
my
first
by
this
company
prickly
on
the
tongue
soft
wheat
character
with
a
slow
and
growing
dryness
that
really
lays
on
the
tongue
ample
carbonation
leads
to
immediate
gas
still
is
a
little
cold
so
ill
let
it
sit
a
bit
and
see
if
it
opens
up
a
little
more
softer
spicing
than
in
the
aroma
this
one
is
cleaner
than
most
and
spices
takes
less
of
a
strong
role
in
the
overall
flavor
with
more
emphasis
on
the
wheat
character
to
me
it
actually
calls
for
a
little
fruit
addition
something
i
would
never
have
said
a
few
years
ago
a
light
tartness
and
sourness
shows
in
time
o
love
this
beer
every
time
i
finish
one
off
i
find
myself
yearning
for
more
this
is
flat
out
one
of
the
best
wheatwitwhite
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
maybe
the
best
it
has
a
very
complex
flavor
profile
especially
considering
the
style
wish
i
could
get
it
a
little
easier
as
they
are
tough
to
come
by
in
my
city
overall
a
great
witbier
and
one
that
really
exemplifies
the
style
this
is
a
heavily
spiced
beer
the
spices
are
easily
the
most
dominant
part
of
the
flavor
in
this
one
its
not
bad
but
it
takes
some
getting
used
to
would
recommend
a
quality
offering
and
one
of
the
best
ive
had
of
this
style
which
i
am
not
crazy
about
o
overall
a
good
beer
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
interesting
enough
to
stand
apart
from
others
in
the
same
style
o
been
many
long
years
since
ive
had
this
still
as
crazy
cloudy
as
i
remember
cloudy
aint
even
the
word
more
pea
soup
murky
its
solid
though
it
could
be
tilted
a
tiny
touch
more
toward
the
spice
less
naked
yeast
flavor
o
perfectly
executed
unbelievably
drinkable
worthy
of
the
high
ratings
this
is
a
new
favorite
of
mine
and
one
that
i
will
regularly
request
pours
a
golden
yellow
and
is
slightly
cloudy
its
got
a
citrus
type
of
fruity
smell
and
taste
to
it
reminds
me
of
a
good
ole
summer
ale
crisp
and
refreshing
definitely
a
beer
that
i
will
go
back
to
in
the
future
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
overall
its
a
really
good
beer
and
lives
up
to
the
hype
of
it
being
one
of
allagashs
favorites
overall
this
is
really
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
retains
a
complex
flavor
profile
top
of
its
class
o
this
is
a
good
version
of
the
style
make
that
an
excellent
version
of
the
style
it
brings
to
mind
those
original
wits
anyone
remember
wit
or
was
it
wt
from
the
90s
i
had
ohsolong
ago
will
drink
again
overall
terrific
stuff
i
paired
this
with
a
garden
burger
and
it
made
the
meal
i
imagine
it
would
make
most
meals
just
an
excellent
beer
that
almost
anyone
would
enjoy
o
very
nice
aroma
great
spices
are
subtle
easy
great
drinker
the
real
deal
definite
yeast
and
herb
notes
body
not
too
thin
refreshing
doesnt
have
the
nuance
of
st
bernardus
but
not
far
off
o
fantastic
and
rewarding
each
quaff
brings
a
different
flavor
profile
out
ooverall
a
great
belgium
wheat
ale
o
its
good
for
the
style
just
a
bit
simple
and
sweet
taste
begins
with
the
traditional
belgian
spices
and
finishes
with
strong
assertive
wheat
that
lingers
exactly
like
it
should
this
style
of
beer
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
allagash
did
a
fantastic
job
clean
crisp
refreshing
traditional
done
right
allagash
white
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
no
head
there
is
an
aroma
filled
with
cloves
and
belgian
spices
the
taste
was
similar
good
clove
flavors
lots
of
belgian
spices
and
candy
flavors
good
full
flavor
not
overpowering
and
good
feel
overall
its
a
very
nice
drinking
beer
o
decent
belgian
white
ale
packed
with
flavor
this
is
always
a
great
go
to
the
allagash
brewing
company
gets
the
lemoncitruscoriander
combination
perfect
made
true
to
form
all
from
the
aroma
to
the
soapy
dishwater
appearance
i
only
wish
they
would
package
them
in
6
packs
as
opposed
to
4s
regardless
this
is
still
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
serving
type
bottle
o
excellent
white
beer
with
body
and
slightly
adjusted
flavor
profile
would
highly
recommend
osuperb
as
most
all
of
the
allagash
brews
ive
had
overallthis
is
a
good
beer
the
coriander
taste
is
a
bit
strong
for
me
at
first
but
as
i
continue
through
the
beer
its
not
as
strong
i
would
recommend
this
beer
as
a
fall
beer
as
the
flavor
and
smell
fit
that
season
very
well
i
prefer
this
beer
to
the
fall
seasonal
pumpkin
beers
o
i
could
easily
go
through
a
six
pack
of
these
particularly
in
the
warmer
months
normally
i
savor
a
beer
for
20
or
more
minutes
and
i
drained
this
one
in
less
than
10
definitely
wanted
a
second
highly
recommend
overall
great
beer
its
a
great
replacement
for
something
like

for

this

had

over
with

drinkers

one
older
uncle
who
is
sworn
to
budweiser
to
the
end
of
his
days
within
an
hour
all
were
drinking
allagash
white
and
asking
for
more
need
i
say
more
o
even
though
im
slightly
less
amazed
by
this
brew
on
my
third
time
around
and
i
no
longer
consider
it
my
favorite
beer
to
date
it
still
holds
the
title
of
the
witbier
to
end
all
witbiers
in
my
mind
the
flavors
are
borderline
flawless
and
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
the
best
ive
experienced
on
any
brew
allagash
truly
hit
a
homerun
with
allagash
white
and
this
brew
has
set
the
standards
by
which
i
judge
a
witbier
i
cant
believe
i
havent
rated
this
yet
so
perfect
my
go
to
for
a
perfect
beer
i
think
the
balance
of
wheat
and
citrus
is
perfect
pours
this
typical
yellowtail
color
with
an
ok
carbonation
and
head
but
the
taste
is
so
f
ing
good
allahash
is
one
of
many
maine
breweries
killing
it
this
beer
is
simply
perfect
overall
to
sum
it
up
its
a
super
light
beer
but
probably
too
much
so
to
be
as
enjoyable
as
it
should
be
o
surprisingly
good
one
or
two
full
glasses
goes
extremely
well
with
rich
or
substantial
food
it
has
enough
presence
and
acidity
to
hold
up
to
a
strong
meal
fish

this

pretty

super
drinkable
o

incredible
variety
of

with

to

it
perfectly
makes
me
wish
it
was

yearround
great
job
allagash
overall
for
almost
4
bucks
i
can
think
of
some
cheaper
offerings
that
match
the
quality
kind
of
pissed
since
i
ordered
the
triple
and
got
this
but
its
a
tasty
beer
regardless
o
to
me
another
good
example
of
the
style
although
i
have
other
witbiers
in
mind
that
i
think
i
like
better
definitely
a
good
summer
beer
and
very
drinkable
o
this
is
one
steady
drinkable
brew
wanna
impress
a
lady
suggest
one
of
these
pours
light
golden
with
a
light
head
and
lacing
the
lacing
diminishes
in
a
few
minutes
light
nose
of
belgian
yeast
and
spice
average
carbonation
a
superb
spiced
beer
of
the
belgian
wit
style
very
crisp
with
a
burst
of
spice
coriander
and
orange
excellent
hop
balance
to
compliment
the
spices
crisp
finish
and
light
mouthfeel
in
accordance
with
the
style
one
of
my
personal
favorites
appearance
is
slightly
cloudy
as
it
should
be
if
you
like
spiced
beer
it
gets
no
better
than
this
drinking
a
few
in
a
row
in
short
the
horrible
flavor
of
this
percolating
yeast
sewage
may
haunt
my
taste
memory
for
the
rest
of
my
miserable
life
unless
i
can
drink
enough
ipas
and
lagers
to
wash
it
away
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
that
i
hope
to
see
more
and
more
at
establishments
overall
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
the
combination
of
a
light
crisp
body
with
plenty
of
fizzy
carbonation
flavors
of
orange
and
lemon
and
a
gentle
roll
into
a
subtle
hoppy
finish
make
this
the
perfect
refreshing
summer
beer
that
still
has
loads
of
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
to
introduce
to
friends
or
girlfriends
who
claim
to
only
like
the
taste
of
generic
lager
overall
4
75
really
outstanding
beer
wheat
beer
is
they
type
of
beer
that
contains
perhaps
the
greatest
percentage
of
drinkable
beer
and
this
one
stands
out
also
im
not
a
fan
of
the
label
but
that
really
doesnt
have
shit
to
do
with
anything
im
just
feeling
irritable
not
necessarily
my
favorite
witbier
but
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
nice
balance
between
spicy
and
sweet
elements
though
ive
always
found
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
lacking
on
the
spiciness
for
my
taste
sharp
carbonation
burn
and
crisp
finish
very
welcomed
on
summer
days
a
very
popular
beer
that
offers
quality
as
well
the
flagship
beer
for
allagash
i
have
been
drinking
this
one
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
i
do
like
it
better
from
the
bottle
than
the
tap
though
an
uncommon
theme
for
me
personally
it
pours
a
real
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
an
inch
of
soapy
white
head
hold
the
orange
slice
please
this
isnt
a
schocktop
aromas
of
orange
zest
and
light
coriander
seed
waft
up
but
so
does
a
nice
bitter
hopping
and
a
density
of
wheat
malt
that
is
quite
pronounced
the
taste
is
the
best
of
the
nose
with
the
orange
being
subtle
sweet
and
acidic
the
body
is
full
for
the
style
which
i
really
like
and
the
belgian
yeast
strain
is
just
right
for
this
brew
probably
the
best
version
of
this
style
brewed
in
the
entire
untied
states
certainly
one
of
them
this
is
a
staple
beer
for
me
but
i
think
it
gets
watery
or
contaminated
via
tap
sometimes
the
bottles
are
always
perfectly
carbonated
but
the
draft
is
hit
or
miss
in
my
experience
it
was
epic
on
tap
at
the
brewery
though
so
fresh
and
bright
this
beer
is
an
all
around
winner
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
recent
selections
of
more
hopped
stronger
brews
great
summer
sipper
with
my
lobster
roll
overalli
think
i
shied
away
from
it
for
its
mass
production
and
popularity
but
it
definitely
gives
me
hope
for
the
palates
of
the
masses
really
good
beer
o
a
flavorful
and
well
balanced
wheat
that
is
right
there
at
the
top
refreshing
highly
drinkable
and
perfect
for
a
sunny
day
must
try
o
the
best
of
the
few
belgian
whites
i
have
had
and
probably
the
nicest
of
the
floralfruity
summertime
beers
ive
tasted
although
this
one
is
meant
for
yearround
consumption
but
this
beer
presents
a
dilemma
its
not
distinctive
enough
to
be
special
and
too
expensive
to
be
everyday
hence
the
scoresthey
might
have
been
a
bit
higher
in
isolation
but
not
when
compared
to
other
representatives
of
the
style
i
would
prefer
more
yeastforward
variants
and
more
subtle
carbonation
but
the
mineral
qualities
make
it
particularly
suitable
for
pairing
with
seafood
perhaps
made
with
maine
lobster
in
mind
sweet
taste
and
a
great
smell
easy
to
drink
and
very
light
yet
it
is
very
flavorable
this
beer
does
not
disappoint
i
am
excited
to
also
try
their
black
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
i
cant
get
over
how
smooth
this
beer
is
it
goes
down
smooth
overallgreat
witbier
especially
on
a
a
hot
day
overall
this
was
an
incredible
beer
that
i
hope
to
have
again
soon
this
is
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
m
light
body
with
some
chew
dry
moderate
carbonation
overall
decent
brew
i
would
have
this
one
again
but
it
is
not
my
first
choice
while
allagash
white
is
lauded
as
a
top
beer
in
the
style
it
didnt
impress
me
all
that
much
its
a
nice
light
refreshing
beer
but
nothing
more
overall
nice
belgian
wit
like
beer
pretty
typical
though
but
nothing
too
special
still
a
tasty
beer
made
in
the
usa
a
nice
belgian
wit
again
not
really
my
fav
style
either
but
hits
well
in
the
hot
summer
heat
wave
were
in
i
really
enjoyed
the
light
crisp
start
with
a
nutmeg
spicy
follow
light
light
yellow
color
very
low
head
nutmeg
finish
we
are
enjoying
it
at
a
coal
fired
pizza
joint
with
italian
food
as
well
i
was
impressed
with
the
light
nature
and
full
flavor
overall
probably
my
favorite
american
wheat
beer
perfectly
balanced
with
the
smoothness
of
a
wheat
beer
and
the
flavor
complexities
of
a
belgian
will
buy
again
when
i
see
it
o
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
brew
excellent
on
a
hot
day
o
solid
wheat
beer
ok
more
that
great
but
a
pleasant
refreshing
beer
that
went
down
rather
well
a
well
made
beer
that
is
quite
refreshing
though
not
packed
with
much
sweetness
hoegaarden
blind
actually
held
up
really
well
against
this
o
excellent
witbier
its
up
there
with
dancing
man
wheat
i
could
drink
a
ton
of
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
the
most
refreshing
ive
had
and
is
perfect
for
summer
at
avas
in
easton
from
the
bottle
pours
lemonade
color
with
small
head
in
a
pint
glass
lemony
yeasty
spice
aroma
flavor
follows
exactly
with
a
nice
citrus
and
spice
balance
medium
sweetness
almost
like
some
honey
that
gives
this
plenty
of
sweet
refreshing
flavor
light
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
solid
carbonation
one
of
my
favorite
wits
for
sure
o
decent
wheat
beer
no
my
favorite
style
but
worth
a
try
o
nice
american
version
of
the
style
that
stays
true
to
the
roots
this
is
legitimately
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
come
summertime
i
put
pen
to
paper
actually
it
was
on
my
phone
notebook
at
the
westin
in
boston
on
this
review
in
may
of
2011
but
i
had
my
first
allagash
in
college
and
have
never
looked
back
the
fruity
crispness
corriander
slight
spice
and
hazy
appearance
make
you
long
to
be
sitting
on
your
deck
in
july
the
only
small
qualm
i
have
with
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
awfully
soft
even
for
a
witbier
absolutely
outstanding
overall
wonderfully
refreshing
body
makes
this
a
somewhat
substantial
and
nourishing
beverage
perfect
for
summer
for
more
head
retention
try
a
larger
percentage
of
wheat
in
the
grist
or
simply
carb
with
more
priming
sugar
or
co2
nearly
outstanding
overall
given
one
of
the
first
really
nice
days
in
wisconsin
this
beer
was
perfect
to
just
relax
on
the
porch
with
and
watch
the
city
live
and
breathe
around
me
this
beer
is
what
all
other
summer
beers
should
strive
to
be
but
it
is
also
great
enough
that
it
could
be
enjoyed
at
any
point
in
the
year
now
the
only
problem
is
how
i
am
going
to
get
my
hands
on
another
bottle
since
allagash
does
not
distribute
to
wisconsin
yet
1720
beautiful
witbier
made
by
allagash
with
a
charming
orangepeel
aroma
honey
coriander
seeds
and
in
a
smaller
scale
pepper
and
wheat
ideas
the
spiceness
is
more
evident
in
the
taste
that
besides
bringing
the
other
elements
of
the
aroma
displays
a
slight
hop
bitterness
that
is
wellpaired
with
the
other
characteristics
the
light
relatively
well
carbonated
body
leaves
such
subtle
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
i
am
absolutely
fascinated
by
the
quality
of
the
allagash
white
i
love
it
to
style
it
is
the
best
witbier
ive
had
to
date
far
better
than
blue
moon
and
hoegaarden
mouth
feel
is
medium
to
light
bodied
very
smooth
and
easy
texture
velvety
touch
no
astringency
drinks
rather
easily
sessionable
overall
very
tasty
a
straightup
good
example
of
a
witbier
im
going
to
have
to
retry
this
beer
in
the
summer
because
in
a
ct
spring
it
just
isnt
what
i
want
that
shouldnt
be
a
slam
on
the
beer
i
want
something
thicker

slightly

spicy
belgium
yeast
and
wheat
with
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
at
the
end
this
is
a
very
inviting
smell
so
i
proceed
with
no
abandon
the
taste
of
the
legendary
allagash
white
zesty
yeast
on
the
tongue
filled
in
with
wheat
graininess
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
such
as
candy
sugar
perhaps
or
maybe
the
sweet
malts
are
so
separated
from
yeast
at
the
end
of
my
drinks
that
it
seems
to
end
with
a
full
body
sweetness
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
witbier
overall
drinkability
enjoyable
as
a
dry
witbier
doesnt
offer
enough
complexity
o
id
be
lying
if
i
said
i
wasnt
slightly
disappointed
in
this
beer
yet
i
can
taste
that
it
is
carefully
crafted
with
skill
i
guess
i
could
sum
it
up
by
saying
i
appreciate
the
craft
but
find
the
taste
refreshing
yet
a
little
plain
and
boring
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
great
appearance
nice
cloudy
golden
hue
great
foamy
head
and
lots
of
dry
sticky
lacing
nose
is
grainy
and
yeasty
with
a
nice
balance
of
citrus
and
spice
flavor
is
not
complex
but
a
refreshing
combination
of
yeast
hops
and
spice
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
i
do
not
like
this
style
of
beer
usually
because
most
are
too
watery
without
the
proper
balance
of
malt
and
spice
but
this
one
does
not
fail
in
that
regard
allagash
is
a
highly
underrated
brewery
i
will
like
to
try
this
one
again
when
it
is
warmer
out
from
the
12
fl
oz
bottle
with
no
date
or
lot
code
seen
sampled
on
march
26
2011
it
pours
a
very
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
head
and
busy
carbonation
wheat
and
yeast
on
the
nose
the
body
is
quite
palpable
and
in
the
medium
range
the
first
reaction
i
get
to
the
taste
is
that
it
is
tart
but
then
the
wheat
and
yeast
kick
in
to
make
it
more
enjoyable
mellow
to
the
end
with
a
slight
hop
finish
o
overall
this
was
a
fantastic
beer
it
had
characteristics
in
common
with
a
tripel
like
la
fin
du
monde
and
a
hefeweizen
lots
of
great
flavor
and
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
a
traditional
witbier
very
light
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
like
to
enjoy
this
again
on
a
warm
day
o
overwhelmed
by
the
yeast
perhaps
good
for
a
summer
day
but
im
still
sticking
with
ipas
for
the
summer
months
i
would
be
surprised
if
i
gave
this
another
shot
cloudy
yellowish
dish
water
look
pretty
par
for
the
course
on
this
style
of
beer
white
head
not
huge
and
goes
away
but
leaves
some
down
the
sides
as
its
consumed
smell
is
spicy
taste
with
some
citrus
again
par
for
the
course
for
this
style
but
the
spices
and
the
carbonation
was
spot
on
i
like
it
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
but
i
would
also
enjoy
it
as
a
compliment
to
a
steak
dinner
d
although
sometimes
inconsistent
in
terms
of
intensity
of
its
sensory
qualities
at
its
best
allagash
white
is
an
american
wit
without
peer
if
anything
the
intensity
of
flavors
here
may
scare
away
some
casual
drinkersa
rare
feat
for
such
an
approachable
style
it
makes
a
strong
first
impression
with
its
remarkable
appearance
and
leaves
on
a
favorable
note
with
the
taste
and
feel
of
wheat
overall
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
i
would
have
it
again
but
i
enjoy
other
wits
more
i
give
two
schlitz
about
allagash
white
it
gives
more
blanco
for
your
banko
poured
a
light
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
that
was
fully
diminishing
and
had
fair
lacing
the
aroma
was
very
mild
of
grainy
malts
light
herbal
hops
and
a
strong
moldy
yeast
with
notes
of
coriander
pepper
and
citrusorange
peel
i
believe
it
tasted
moderately
bitter
at
first
for
a
wheat
ale
and
ended
with
a
light
bitter
yeasty
flavor
that
had
hints
of
spices
and
orange
peel
with
the
flavor
not
lasting
long
at
all
mouthfeel
was
light
in
body
and
creamy
in
texture
with
a
nice
soft
carbonation
overall
a
nice
creamy
wheat
ale
actually
nicely
surprising
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
clean
as
i
mentioned
earlier
but
can
also
get
creamy
in
parts
which
is
a
nice
contrast
drinkability
is
very
good
too
with
the
body
being
full
and
diverse
in
taste
and
the
finish
being
light
dry
and
neutral
worthy
beer
that
is
distributed
pretty
well
i
would
recommend
to
all
beer
lovers
drinkability
great
beer
for
this
style
good
any
time
of
year
d
very
high
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
on
a
hot
day
on
the
back
porch
or
at
a
cafe
people
watching
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
half
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
extremely
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
and
slight
dirt
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
grain
and
a
slight
earthy
note
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
definitely
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
had
a
nicely
balanced
sweetness
going
on
in
the
flavor
here
with
a
nice
fruit
aspect
as
well
also
a
good
aroma
to
keep
you
coming
back
the
dirt
was
a
little
offputting
but
seemed
to
flow
quite
nicely
a
definite
must
try
the
cpj
i
must
say
i
was
once
in
the
category
of
being
scared
of
the
spicy
belgian
style
beer
but
now
i
have
been
enlightened
by
the
balance
and
presence
offered
by
allagash
white
thank
you
portland
maine
one
day
i
shall
pay
my
respects
with
a
visit
i
have
been
enjoying
wheat
beer
more
lately
and
this
one
was
very
nice
i
thought
it
had
great
balance
and
strong
flavors
i
could
certainly
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
definitely
very
drinkable
and
i
could
easily
see
myself
absentmindedly
downing
a
pitcher
of
this
if
i
werent
careful
overall
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
wit
beers
it
is
more
aggressively
hopped
which
creates
a
refreshing
and
balanced
bitter
finish
i
would
enjoy
this
at
any
time
of
the
year
though
it
would
be
best
on
warmer
and
sunnier
days
during
the
spring
or
summer
smell
was
of
light
lemon
and
a
little
grassy
the
taste
was
very
fresh
and
light
the
main
flavor
was
form
the
yeast
with
some
crispness
from
the
carbonation
also
slight
lemon
zest
and
almost
a
soapy
freshness
that
stayed
with
the
aftertaste
this
is
another
classic
example
of
someone
executing
the
wit
tougher
than
most
would
think
but
they
certainly
hit
this
one
out
of
the
park
this
a
beer
that
ill
be
having
a
for
a
long
long
while
totally
accessible
recommendable
and
drinkable
for
all
seasons
one
of
these
days
im
gonna
have
a
taste
off
with
this
and
hoegaarden
good
times
will
be
had
t
nice
light
body
and
crisp
carbonation
big
backbone
of
yeast
and
pale
grains
with
coriander
and
slight
hop
notes
lemon
zest
and
orange
peel
come
through
more
towards
the
finish
very
slight
bitterness
one
of
the
more
balanced
witbeers
while
its
nice
and
yeastymalty
it
isnt
overpowering
nor
are
the
citrus
and
spice
notes
mellow
and
balanced
a
great
summer
drink
usually
on
tap
or
12oz
bottle
poured
into
snifter
glass
body
appeared
almost
the
color
of
orange
flesh
orange
subdued
by
white
cloudiness
with
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
eventually
subsided
aroma
was
sweet
orange
peel
grass
coriander
a
dash
of
pepper
and
perhaps
cloves
flavor
was
sweet
clove
like
malt
light
orange
peel
with
a
subdued
sweetness
toward
the
back
slightly
herbal
grassy
and
citric
palate
was
very
soft
and
sensuous
carbonation
just
tickled
the
back
of
the
throat
and
afterards
a
light
orange
peel
taste
lingered
appearance
is
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
orange
with
barely
a
little
foam
pretty
good
retention
aroma
is
mild
but
otherwise
typical
of
wits
spices
citrus
yeast
taste
is
very
creamy
with
a
bit
of
citric
zest
and
spice
good
yeast
profile
too
really
impressive
actually
mouthfeel
is
light
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
quality
wit
the
spices
are
the
highlight
of
this
one
for
me
its
a
great
tasting
wheat
beer
without
the
heavy
body
that
comes
with
most
wheat
beers
ive
tasted
d
easy
drinkability
its
an
ok
beer
for
me
d
good
beer
great
representation
of
the
style
particularly
for
an
american
brewery
d
very
easy
to
drink
so
creamy
for
such
a
grainy
style
beer
smooth
and
slight
sweet
edge
flows
so
easy
the
best
the
best
the
best
i
got
this
beer
at
the
best
beer
store
francestown
village
store
a
must
see
store
has
every
beer
you
can
imagine
d
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
putting
away
a
bomber
of
this
or
maybe
even
a
6pack
would
be
no
trouble
at
all
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
as
exciting
as
i
expected
great
choice
of
a
belgian
style
unfiltered
wheat
great
brewery
to
visit
in
portland
maine
allagash
white
is
a
typical
witbier
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
minimal
head
and
no
lasting
lace
its
aroma
is
largely
of
banana
with
hints
of
coriander
and
vanilla
the
flavor
starts
with
spice
notes
followed
by
lemon
and
a
good
malthop
balance
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
its
drinkability
is
good
very
refreshing
recommended
d
very
high
session
got
for
it
brilliant
use
of
spices
great
balance
just
a
joy
to
drink
a
no
detectable
bitterness
just
a
little
pepper
to
balance
out
the
sweetness
delicious
and
quenching
id
love
to
drink
many
more
d
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
to
just
sit
there
watch
tv
and
chill
out
with
had
this
in
a
late
fall
cold
snap
but
this
would
be
equally
great
out
on
the
porch
in
a
dead
summer
heat
d
great
beer
for
any
time
of
year
and
even
newbies
may
enjoy
this
fine
representation
worth
trying
good
times
overall
i
would
recommend
trying
this
one
if
you
like
wheat
beerswitbiers
i
thought
it
would
be
a
more
concentrated
flavorful
version
of
blue
moon
or
hoegaarden
which
it
was
but
not
in
ways
that
were
very
enjoyable
taste
is
very
light
and
subdued
but
also
spicy
and
crisp
its
not
too
in
your
face
but
re
belgian
yeast
comes
through
well
very
good
and
easy
drinking
d
this
is
a
good
drinking
beer
and
will
go
right
down
on
a
humid
day
while
its
easy
to
drink
other
aspects
keep
me
from
giving
it
a
higher
score
very
good
beer
made
by
a
good
brewery
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
the
owner
a
couple
of
times
and
he
is
very
committed
to
putting
out
quality
beers
d
highly
drinkable
and
one
of
the
better
witbiers
ive
had
it
poured
to
be
a
light
golden
color
with
a
citrus
aroma
there
was
no
bitter
aftertaste
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
you
can
easily
drink
more
than
one
in
a
session
not
bad
but
i
was
expecting
more
after
seeing
all
the
reviews
d
this
is
by
far
the
most
drinkable
beer
ive
ever
tasted
the
taste
is
delicious
and
the
faintness
in
the
aftertaste
almost
just
leaves
you
wanting
more
seems
like
the
perfect
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
i
actually
once
thought
that
while
the
mass
produced
beers
failed
in
every
other
category
they
had
drinkability
down
to
an
art
this
beer
has
changed
everything
about
that
belief
pours
a
cloudy
golden
with
a
small
white
head

of
citrusy
hops

md
extremely
easy
drinking
light

overall
a
really
well
made
beer
worthy
of
its

some

im

with

of

on

this

me

get
my

on

the
beer
was
definitely
a
light
one
and
there
was
nothing
truly
noteworthy
of
it
but
it
was
an
easy
enough
beer
to
drink
in

of
this
the
taste
and
smell
for
that
matter
were
both
good
but
didnt
seem

it

quite

had

they
were

easily
i
will
harvest
this

wow
o
an
okay
beer
but
my
expectations
were
so
much
higher
i
guess
i
was
just
a
sucker
for
the
story
the
packaging
the
website
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
which
is
easy
to
drink
note
that
the
12
oz
bottle
version
of
this
beer
is
very
sunky
grade
f
the
22
oz
bottle
is
quite
pricey
but
you
can
stop
drinking
it
one
of
my
friends
call
it
a
nice
sipping
beer
its
on
my
you
gotta
try
list
o
an
enjoyable
dry
beer
that
is
pretty
food
friendly
and
would
go
well
with
lighter
dishes
such
as
seafood
or
chicken
could
be
better
but
for
mass
produced
beer
it
is
not
bad
not
as
good
as
hoegaarden
but
a
bit
different
than
other
wit
beers
made
by
the
big
breweries
id
drink
it
over
blue
moon
at
least
o
i
wasnt
sure
how
this
would
go
the
labeling
on
the
box
and
bottle
made
it
seem
like
a
world
class
beer
but
the
price
tag
and
alcohol
content
said
runofthemill
i
was
expecting
the
latter
but
kept
myself
open
to
the
former
i
got
the
latter
it
did
have
those
citrus
notes
and
refreshment
it
promised
but
on
much
smaller
scale
than
suggested
it
was
good
but
nothing
i
would
advocate
looking
for
the
packaging
of
the
beer
a
large
winelike
bottle
sold
in
a
classy
black
box
suggests
serving
it
chilled
in
a
white
wine
glass
filling
it
only
halfway
while
im
a
proponent
of
using
proper
glassware
to
enhance
the
various
qualities
of
a
good
beer
im
not
sure
its
really
necessary
as
a
regular
pilsner
glass
does
the
job
while
it
certainly
couldnt
hurt
to
use
a
wine
glass
i
think
inedit
will
please
no
matter
what
high
praise
for
the
concept
but
the
execution
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
this
beer
would
rock
in
an
imperial
version
but
as
it
is
its
like
that
eric
idle
comment
on
american
beer
something
about
a
canoe
i
wanted
to
love
this
beer
and
after
reading
the
mini
booklet
that
came
with
the
bottle
i
was
expecting
so
much
more
i
assume
the
name
is
a
pun
on
damn
i
need
it
maybe
not
but
minus
points
either
way
if
this
is
damms
best
beer
i
dont
feel
much
need
to
explore
more
it
is
very
watery
and
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
unpleasant
not
like
last
sip
unpleasant
but
not
very
good
either
if
it
was
maybe
6
or
7
for
the
bottle
i
would
be
less
upset
but
when
you
enter
double
digits
it
needs
to
be
justified
in
the
taste
of
the
beer
sadly
it
wasnt
here
i
guess
it
is
quite
a
unique
style
and
i
cant
say
ive
had
anything
quite
like
it
before
or
since
but
overall
it
really
just
isnt
that
exciting
especially
coming
from
the
likes
of
ferren
adria
id
have
it
again

not
in
a

or
at

really
good
too
bland
too
sweet
this
witbier
is
fairly
clear
bodied
and
the
carbonation
is
pretty
good
the
head
is
white
and
extremely
bubbly
and
thins
out
really
quickly
the
aroma
is
pretty
good
wheat
and
mild
malts
smells
come
through
light
grasses
lemon
zest
and
not
much
else
its
slightly
spicy
you
can
start
to
taste
some
other
spices
coriander
mild
hops
start
to
come
in
as
you
swallow
but
the
taste
is
rather
lacking
i
wish
the
spices
were
a
bit
more
evident
it
is
crisp
on
the
tongue
and
remains
light
and
refreshing
this
one
isnt
bad
for
the
style
but
i
would
expect
more
from
a
chef
overall
not
a
bad
spanish
take
on
a
belgium
style
it
doesnt
drink
like
water
and
has
enough
flavor
to
consider
it
part
of
the
style
i
would
pass
on
it
if
given
the
chance
regardless
of
how
fancy
the
bottle
is
coriander
and
citrus
are
evident
on
the
first
sip
but
arent
very
strong
hops
take
a
back
seat
on
this
one
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
and
a
very
clean
finish
overall
a
mild
tasting
beer
that
was
certainly
drinkable
just
a
bit
boring
this
one
would
be
best
served
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
a
barbeque
than
during
the
winter
months
o
a
novely
beer
from
spain
and
honestly
i
prefer
mahou
better
worth
trying
but
givren
the
price

i
expected
more

this

overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with

and
it

sad
i
only
have
one

of
this
beer
this
beer
is
near
perfection
jd
o
all
in
all
its
a
typical
purposebrewed
food
pairing
beer
a
little
sweet
and
clumsy
to
have
just
on

but
its
a
damn
fine
witbier
when
consumed

cold
as
it
befits
the

o
this
is
a
pretty
good
witbier
better
than
other
beers
from

drinkabilty
is
great
and
the
beer
feels
very
refreshing
could
use
some
improvement
in
blending
flavours
a
bit
more
shows
once
again
that
industrial
breweries
have
potential
in
making
good
fairly
priced
beer
if
they
only
put
a
little
effort
think
of
what
they
could
do

they
put

what
the

is
this
beer
it
was
so

almost
like

it
was
fairly
disappointing
for
the

and
appearence
good
marketing
o
this
is
an
okay
beer
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
which
makes
me
wonder
why
the
el
bulli
chef
which
is
known
for
his
experimental
food
would
put
his
name
on
such
a
beer
that
plays
it
that
safe
without
any
form
of
innovation
o
im
glad
i
gave
this
a
try
i
do
not
think
ive
had
very
many
biers
from
spain
but
this
is
very
nice
i
want
to
try
more
o
a
witbier
that
pairs
very
well
together
with
fish

i

the
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
small
1

with
little
retention
and
little

the
aroma
is
faint

provides

flavor
heavy
wheat
influence
here
just
like
the

the
flavor
is
wheat
heavy
too
much
so
in
my
opinion
the
crisp
fruity
sweetness
is
very
much
subdued
lighter
bodied
and
decently
carbonated
overall
not
much
going
on
here
the
little
booklet
suggests
the
beer
is
made
to
be
paired
with
food
i
paired
mine
with
a
baked
chicken
the
beer
did
nothing
for
the
food
nor
me
not
sure
its
worth
close
to
the
asking
price
not
bad
not
great
o
a
nice
beer
for
aa
hot
summer
would
go
for
it
again
overall
is
a
light
beer
that
match
perfecly
with
seafood
in
general
come
into
the
light
this
is
a
lightgolden
colored
beer
with
a
nice

theres
a

pale
belgianstyle
aroma
to
itsome
floral
esters
but
not
a
whole
lot
its
thinbodied
lightly
flavored
do
you
see
the
trend
here
with
a
curious
finish
for
as
much
as
ive
seen
this
around
i
really
didnt
miss
much
by
not
trying
it
until
now
a
really
well
done
beer
that
is
easily
attainable
feeble
in
designing
a
food
beer
that
is
all
things
to
all
people
this
has
been
dumbed
down
by
committee
to
lack
any
real
character
inoffensive
in
the
worst
way
its
soft
beer
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
pretty
active
but
it
is
never
sharp
of
prickly
its
more
cloudlike
overall
this
is
an
aboveaverage
witbier
only
because
of
its
unique
flavors
for
the
style
this
is
not
a
beer
to
drink
by
itself
though
its
too
seemingly
underflavored
for
that
instead
drink
this
as
the
brewers
and
el
bulli
collaborators
intended
it
as
a
true
compliment
to
light
foods
that
wine
has
trouble
with
this
beer
is
going
to
be
fantastically
complimentary
with
fish
with
light
oily
salads
with
artichoke
asparagus
etc
its
very
versatile
with
light
dishes
food
pairing
the
makers
of
this
beer
say
that
this
beer
is
meant
for
dining
and
i
can
see
why
its
very
light
and
has
low
alcohol
i
could
see
this
pairing
well
with
some
fish
and
root
vegetables
of
course
the
bottle
is
nice
but
who
cares
however
i
think
the
concept
is
a
bit
too
pretentious
for
me
developed
by
sommeliers
and
a
chef
it
should
be
served
in
wine
glasses
and
kept
in
a
chilled
bucket
heres
how
im
interpreting
all
this
beer
isnt
as
good
as
classy
and
refined
as
wine
so
were
going
to
make
one
thats
a
close
to
a
wine
as
possible
but
still
technically
a
beer
overall
this
is
a
light
refreshing
beer
it
might
be
nice
during
the
summer
the
flavours
arent
especially
interesting
though
i
think
it
tries
to
have
snob
appeal
with
the
bottle
but
i
was
a
little
underwhelmed
interesting
beer
engineered
for
food
as
per
the
pamphlet
subtle
but
fairly
tasty
overall
there
is
some
potential
here
but
i
was
disappointed
with
the
fact
that
it
had
some
of
the
qualities
found
in
a
cheap
adjunct
beer
especially
considering
the
high
price
of
the
bottle
speaking
of
which
the
flashy
bottle
is
probably
the
best
part
of
this
beer
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
this
is
a
beer
that
comes
off
strong
but
the
taste
is
surprisingly
weak
still
this
is
a
refreshing
and
tasty
wheat
beer
not
to
mention
the
spiffy
bottle
id
recommend
this
when
its
hot
out
the
cpj
mouthfeel
was
good
this
brew
doesnt
taste
that
bad
however
the
original
price
tag
was
too
exorbitant
and
i
hope
that
nobody
bought
it
at
that
price
seriously
when
you
need
to
mark
own
the
beer
80
to
move
it
mouthfeel
is
nice
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
a
decent
whitbier
for
a
spanish
brewery
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
german
whits
that
are
plentiful
fow
about
the
same
price
this
beer
is
approximately
6
usd
out
in
town
decent
wit
certainly
drinkable
and
would
be
one
to
introduce
this
style
to
a
neophyte
still
want
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
or
new
collaborations
with
elbulli
since
i
feel
like
there
was
lots
of
potential
edit
checked
the
reviews
and
the
other
stuff
this
brewery
produces
and
seems
like
this
is
the
best
theyve
got
so
a
great
mouthfeel
makes
up
some
lost
ground
with
a
creamy
and
light
feel
that
finished
very
dry
overall
not
bad
a
little
bit
pricey
for
what
it
is
though
i
paid
8
something
for
the
bottle
coriander
and
orange
are
evident
on
the
first
sip
but
arent
strong
hops
are
there
in
the
background
thought
they
dont
play
a
major
part
nice
mouthfeel
with
a
very
clean
finish
overall
a
mild
tasting
beer
that
was
very
drinkable
it
would
be
good
on
a
hot
day
with
spicy
foods
nose
is
citrus
peach
pitted
fruit
floral
some
spice
orange
rind
taste
is
very
citrusy
nice
balance
of
fruit
with
low
acidity
flavourful
taste
enough
hops
to
make
it
all
work
body
on
the
thin
side
what
i
really
liked
about
this
beer
is
the
refreshing
effervescence
clean
sweet
finish
lingers
briefly
not
bad
at
all
likely
better
in
warmer
weather
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
little
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
strong
with
floral
hops
and
some
spices
very
nice
the
taste
is
a
little
too
empty
you
can
definitely
tell
it
is
a
wheat
beer
with
the
sweet
perfume
floral
characters
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
too
carbed
but
overall
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
bit
of
an
odd
duck
not
necessarily
bad
i
will
gladly
drink
the
entire
bottle
but
a
little
off
for
a
witbier
nice
soft
creamy
carbonation
though
an
inoffensive
drop
but
a
big
wow
on
the
boring
factor
fuck
you
im
being
oxymoronic
your
mothers
an
oxymoron
i
think
part
of
the
harsh
reviews
stem
from
the
high
expectations
and
heavy
hype
this
beer
has
received
and
i
think
its
silly
to
spend
3040
on
a
bottle
as
ive
seen
in
some
locations
for
10
though
this
is
a
perfectly
acceptable
witbier
that
went
nicely
with
the
lemon
chicken
hummus
and
garlic
flatbread
my
wife
prepared
dnothing
spectacular
here
you
could
spend
less
and
get
more
out
of
your
beer
no
not
a
lot
going
for
this
it
really
doesnt
manage
to
struggle
above
its
genesis
as
a
pale
euro
lager
while
its
probably
cleaner
and
a
little
more
interesting
than
most
calling
this
a
witbier
is
a
genuine
stretch
d
i
think
this
was
my
first
and
only
spanish
beer
that
ive
tried
i
dont
think
ill
be
rushing
out
to
sample
anything
else
from
this
brewery
the
literature
that
comes
on
the
bottle
claims
this
lagerale
hybrid
is
the
ideal
pairing
for
any
meal
i
dont
see
how
thats
possible
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
nonic
pint

the
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
good
and
theres
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
brew
smells
mostly
like
wheatgrain
along
with
some
orange
peel
and
a
bit
of
coriander
the
taste
is
just
like
the
aroma
it
tastes
mostly
like
wheatgrain
along
with
some
coriander
and
orange
peel
mouthfeelbody
is
lightmedium
and
has
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
its
not
hard
to
drink
not
a
bad
brew
overall
it
was
nice
to
try
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
i
had
some
coeur
de
lion
pié
dangloys
a
soft
french
cheese
with
the
beer
and
it
went
very
well
however
the
beer
just
lacked
that
something
which
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
crowd
pleasant
but
no
world
beater
a
decent
beer
to
go
with
food
with
a
few
fruity
and
spicy
notes
but
ultimately
it
falls
a
little
flat
with
too
much
of
a
lager
element
to
it
d
goes
down
extremely
easy
and
the
flavour
mix
is
very
appealing
this
would
be
a
great
summer
sessioner
the
appearance
had
me
a
tad
worried
from
the
start
but
things
only
looked
up
from
there
the
spiciness
loosely
reminiscent
of
a
winter
warmer
helps
to
define
this
beer
and
plays
very
well
with
everything
from
the
wheat
to
the
bready
finish
its
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
but
id
give
this
another
go
d
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
so
its
a
good
surprise
a
quality
wheat
beer
i
could
have
all
night
d
poundable
refreshing
and
flavourful
this
stuff
offers
a
unique
orange
citrus
twist
on
the
standard
witbier
a
perfect
patio
drink
and
definitely
worth
a
try
d
this
is
a
very
simple
wheat
beer
it
is
certainly
no
witbier
as
there
are
no
spices
herbs
or
citrus
just
wheat
and
grain
this
beer
is
not
bad
its
just
bland
and
very
boring
i
cant
write
much
more
about
it
because
there
isnt
anything
else
to
it
for
the
effort
of
going
out
of
their
way
to
produce
a
such
a
blended
product
they
claim
wheat
beer
and
lager
it
doesnt
quite
stand
up
on
its
own
beyond
an
average
experience
quenching
for
sure
but
light
in
the
flavour
department
note
as
intended
i
ate
this
with
food
and
found
it
to
be
a
remarkable
complement
to
my
meal
i
think
that
part
of
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
its
very
floral
which
contrasts
to
almost
any
food
and
refreshes
your
mind
with
a
new
smell
and
taste
in
addition
its
crisp
dryness
works
well
and
requires
very
little
bitterness
for
palette
refreshment
id
highly
recommend
not
drinking
this
beer
by
itself
it
was
a
really
wonderful
experience
you
put
one
of
historys
most
innovative
chefs
and
the
sommeliers
of
the
worlds
most
famous
restaurant
in
a
room
together
and
they
came
up
with
a
witbier
i
never
ate
at
el
bulli
but
from
my
impressions
this
beer
is
no
different
beyond
the
fancy
presentation
and
considerable
price
tag
theres
nowhere
near
the
amount
of
substance
it
is
hyped
up
to
have
pours
a
goldenyellow
colour
with
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
down
leaving
a
small
ring
above
the
beer
some
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
clove
other
unidentified
spices
wheat
and
oranges
flavour
is
slightly
tart
little
bit
sweet
as
well
really
smooth
mouthfeel
a
really
nice
witbier
id
be
likely
to
buy
more
of
this
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
almost
twice
the
price
of
blanch
du
chambly
in
ontario
flawless
and
drinkable
witbier
not
as
well
balanced
as
a
hoegaarden
though
definitely
recommended
better
then
i
expected
so
thats
never
a
bad
thing
perhaps
much
better
suited
to
some
hot
sun
but
i
may
drink
it
again
even
with
our
shitty
weather
pours
a
light
copper
color
with
a
good
deal
of
haze
white

with

caramel
taste
is
a
bit
plain
with
lift
orange
and
coriander
pretty
good
feel
but
the
body
is
a
bit
off
a
pretty
interesting
concept
and
all
around
a
pretty
good
beer
aroma
is
crisp
yeasty
and
wheaty
with
an
undertone
of
lemon
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
strawyellow
not
inspiring
but
at
least
the
snowwhite
head
is
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
and
leaves
decent
lacing
an
extra
half
point
for
that
flavor
is
typically
wheaty
and
yeasty
with
a
faint
lemon
undertone
a
teensy
on
the
thin
side
but
still
potable
texture
is
smooth
a
bit
watery
barely
fizzy
i
expected
better
from
the
appearance
of
the
bottle
as
well
as
the
cost
i
lost
the
slip
so
im
not
sure
how
much
i
spent
but
it
was
not
cheap
dont
think
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
but
im
glad
i
gave
it
a
fair
shake
dare
i
say
anyone
could
drink
this
i
would
dare
this
is
an
easy
drinking
clean
no
frills
beer
it
really
has
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
which
could
be
its
downfall
on
the
other
hand
this
is
a
beer
that
would
make
a
nice
intro
beer
for
noncraft
drinkers
glad
i
grabbed
a
couple
bottles
for
the
price
i
got
them

also
a
hint
of
liquorice
when
you
know
it
should
be
there
the

is
moderately

the
liquorice
is
barely
discernible
in
the
flavour
light
bodied
not
very

with

empty

an
otherwise
nice
and
refreshing
beer
nice
fringe
beer
poured
bright
without
much
carbonation
very
lacy

which
diminished
fairly
quickly
could
actually
watch
the

collapsing
on
itself
the
restaurant
i
had
it
in
served
it
in
a
wine
glass
as
suggested
good
flavor
hints
of
orange
peel
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
most
surprisingly
was
the
finish
very
dry
paired
very
nicely
with
the
sockeye
salmon
i
had
while
on
a
visit
in
vancouver
d
not
bad
a
simple
little
beer
that
i
probably
held
onto
for
a
bit
too
long
an
agreeable
enough
witbier
to
be
sure
pretty
well
balanced
if
a
bit
more
prevalent
on
the
sweet
malt
side
than
any
of
the
now
faded
fruity
spicy
offset
the
accompanying
booklet
cum
marketing
spiel
indeed
promises
a
fair
lot
more
than
is
actually
delivered
but
thats
to
be
expected
this
is
just
a
more
or
less
simply
rendered
and
drinkable
wit
with
or
without
food

light
yellow

with

and
minimal

aroma
of

and
some
orange

somewhat
bland
taste
is
also
an
average
mix
between
some
orange
peel
with
notes
of
coriander
and
light
wheat
malt
body
is
too
thin
for
style
with
some
good
carbonation
makes
you
wonder
why
el
bulli
decided
to
get
associated
with
this
beer
as
this
is
really
average
overall
i
would
have
loved
to
give
it
a
go
with
the
pairing
recommendation
of
a
citrusbased
fish
dish
could
be
quite
nice
as
is
an
easy
drinker
that
wont
wow
a
seasoned
craft
beer
drinker
this
dry
witbier
is
made
for
food
with
its
clear
yeast
sitrus
and
floral
components
a
really
good
mouthfeel
but
it
lacks
some
concentration
a
very
good
beer
for
warm
weather
went
well
with
swedish
herring
probably
the
best
spanish
beer
ive
tried
nice
easy
summer
drinking
would
be
a
regular
if
the
price
was
a
bit
more
reasonable
although
the
beer
is
billed
as
a
witbier
estrella
damm
inedit
has
many
of
the
halmarks
of
hoegaarden
but
with
a
more
characterful
spiciness
and
dryness
this
was
another
beer
of
theres
i
got
a
chance
to
try
as
a
sample
that
was
interesting
but
not
my
overall
cup
of
tea
it
was
very
fruity
and
sweet
wheat
style
beer
it
certainly
was
something
i
could
never
see
my
self
sitting
down
and
drinking
very
much
of
at
all
just
to
sweet
and
too
bland
and
over
citrusy
to
be
my
cup
of
tea
may
be
something
that
some
witbier
lovers
would
enjoy
but
just
nothing
special
to
me
probably
will
not
buy
this
one
again
incidentally
pouring
it
into
a
wine
glass
didnt
change
anything
d
more
of
a
novelty
try
for
me
interesting
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
worth
the
try
if
youre
into
witbier
variations
but
at
a
very
high
price
if
you
do
find
it
honestly
id
rather
put
my
money
into
witte
or
allagash
both
of
which
are
much
less
expensive
and
also
better
purchased
in
whitehorse
yukon
pours
hazy
yellow
with
massive
soapy
head
aroma
of
hops
hay
and
some
citrus
taste
was
light
and
slightly
bitter
with
a
sour
drawn
out
finish
light
carbonation
and
a
thin
body
overall
pleasant
but
not
terribly
memorable
i
feel
that
so
much
more
could
be
done
with
this
beer
perhaps
in
future
incarnations
d
refreshing
witbiers
usually
are
and
this
one
is
no
exception
really
interesting
that
this
one
is
brewed
in
spain
ive
only
had
rather
boring
lagers
from
spain
before
drinkability
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
i
would
choose
one
of
the
many
other
witbiers
first
over
all
i
am
extremely
let
down
with
all
the
good
things
that
id
heard
here
and
the
huge
price
tag
i
was
expecting
something
much
better
i
will
not
purchase
this
again
a
snazzy
looking
bottle
estrella
casts
a
golden
glow
with
a
hazy
yellow
punch
not
the
cleanest
looking
brew
a
little
hard
to
see
through
a
nice
pillow
of
white
fluff
stood
above
and
retreated
leaving
nothing
smells
mostly
of
pale
malt
and
hay
with
some
aroma
hops
getting
some
honey
in
the
taste
along
with
a
very
light
sweet
malt
and
apple
skins
some
yeasty
bread
and
the
like
feel
is
on
the
light
side
and
tame
in
flavor
although
its
pretty
well
balanced
carb
is
on
the
low
end
very
drinkable
and
approachable
for
many
people
this
is
one
that
i
would
share
with
people
that
are
not
big
into
beer
i
hear
this
is
the
ultimate
pairing
beer
when
it
comes
to
food
i
prefer
local
1
instead
d
its
a
rather
tame
beer
but
super
drinkable
pairs
well
with
lots
of
stuff
but
i
guess
thats
what
they
were
going
for
easy
drinking
here
body
is
light
bright
and
airy
very
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
although
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
look
for
in
a
witbier
its
still
quite
pleasant
and
the
mouthfeel
is
lovely
a
bit
pricey
but
a
very
enjoyable
beer

decent
enough
poured
with
a
small
off
white
head
and
a
tiny
bit
of
lace
color
is
a
cloudy
amber
aroma
is
quite
a
mild
spicey

malt
flavors
the
same
only
bolder
body
is
a

thin
but
good
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
fairly
short
could
be
a
session
for
the
right
mood
i
think
its
a
great
beer
altough
its
pricey
this
bottle
cost

750

a

that
holds
for

is
clean
some

coriander
citrus
all
very
faint
i
cant
appreciate
the
liquorice
watery
in
the
tongue
it
tastes
of
spices
banana
and
flowers
i
think
is
a
try
to
make
a
wit
beer
adapted
to
the
big
market
with
te
results
one
can
expect
nothing
to
do
with
the
real
thing
though
is
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
a
great
beer
now
i
have
to
try
it
with
the
food
pairings
it
suggests
really
a
nice
wit
the
spicing
is
just
about
perfect
noticeable
but
not
overwhelming
and
the
addition
of
licorice
is
a
nice
touch
that
sets
this
apart
from
most
other
wits
indeed
this
would
be
a
nice
pairing
with
food
im
thinking
some
mussels
or
other
shellfish
andor
a
fresh
leafy
greens
salad
with
vinaigrette
id
take
this
over
many
american
and
even
a
few
belgian
versions
of
the
style
a
nice
wit
easy
enough
to
drink
a
bit
pricey
at
about
10
bucks
a
bottle
but
certainly
worth
trying
at
least
once
dthis
is
a
fantastic
wit
and
one
i
hope
to
encounter
again
it
hits
all
the
right
notes
for
the
style
without
getting
into
the
cloying
zone
that
some
manage
to
do
well
balanced
and
tasty
highly
recommended
d
750ml
no
problem
session
beer
makes
me
think
hot
day
in
summer
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
zippy
bits
of
carbonation
tickling
the
palate
would
like
to
have
a
bit
more
in
the
feel
very
light
slight
carbonation
went
well
with
a
variety
of
soft
cheeses
and
bread
brought
out
the
orange
zest
very
easy
drinking
would
go
well
with
many
meals
methinks
drinkability
this
is
good
enough
to
savor
if
a
bit
clumsy
this
is
an
odd
beer
it
isnt
that
bad
it
isnt
worth
the
price
but
it
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
wasnt
expecting
this
high
caliber
brew
for
this
brewery
or
this
distinct
of
a
brew
after
drinking
it
i
understand
why
it
was
made
to
pair
with
food
especially
fish
dishes
i
liked
the
promo
booklet
attached
to
the
bottle
to
give
some
of
the
history
in
making
this
beer
and
would
try
it
again
with
a
meal
i
wish
it
was
a
tad
bit
less
expensive
as
it
was
not
worthy
of
the
price
paid
for
it
a
very
interesting
brew
that
probably
will
pair
very
well
with
a
number
of
flavours
and
dishes
without
being
too
much
notes
what
an
interesting
marketing
ploy
expectations
from
a
star
gourmet
pairing
with
a
macro
brewer
to
produce
a
better
beer
would
seem
to
deserve
an
opportunity
at
least
a
somewhat
mediocre
brew
but
one
that
would
have
helped
to
raise
the
average
offering
would
have
been
rather
welcome
but
this
pretense
without
the
substance
and
all
that
marketing
and
elitism
can
accomplish
well
that
is
unfortunately
a
better
sense
of
what
this
is
all
about
so
much
for
adria
doing
beer
overall
not
a
good
beer
weak
in
aroma
and
completely
void
in
taste
with
watery
mouthfeel
a
mess
dont
recommend
i
think
i
paid
10
for
it
so
even
more
of
a
disappointment
rotation
avail
in
tx
but
one
and
done
for
sure
pours
a
threefinger

head
that
fades
slowly
to
a

layer

leaves
some

for
a
750ml
bottle
from

warehouse
winooski
vt
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
is
a
very
hazy
cloudy
tan
color
with
a
small
thick
head
excellent
wit
aroma
with
a
large
amount
of
coriander
and
a
sharp
scent
of
bitter
oranges
the
coriander
isnt
as
strong
in
the
taste
but
its
present
the
most
obvious
flavor
is
a
sweet
acidic
citrusness
with
a
yeasty
hint
of
honey
tart
and
refreshing
the
body
is
odd
its
quite
carbonated
yet
it
feels
thin
and
watery
otherwise
a
wellcrafted
wit
it
should
be
noted
that
this
beer
retails
for
5
86
can
at
our
government
stores
which
is
much
less
than
the
10
us
quoted
in
previous
reviews
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
very
hazy
the
aroma
is
yeasty
with
a
little
bit
of
coriander
but
not
too
much
else
still
it
smells
nice
the
flavor
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
as
i
didnt
get
any
orange
or
coriander
i
got
a
lot
of
peach
flavor
which
was
nice
even
if
unexpected
the
beer
has
a
very
light
mouthfeel
with
lots
of
carbonation
not
true
to
the
style
but
still
a
very
refreshing
beer
d
not
the
extreme
beer
but
a
nice
session
drinkability
tasty
but
overpriced
spend
the
sawbuck
at
your
local
brewpubs
wit
instead
itll
go
so
much
farther
overall
a
fairly
tasty
spanish
beer
that
pushes
a
few
envelopes
as
a
witbierlager
hybrid
but
ultimately
needs
some
more
oomph
given
the
pricetag
and
pomp
surrounding
it
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
75cl
bottle
inedit
is
not
a
traditional
witbier
its
actually
blended
with
a
lager

but
slightly

i
am
hoping
that
barcelonas
got
something
more
exciting
for
me
to
pour
if
anyones
got
something
spanish
to
try
id
be
happy
to
hear
about
it
this
beer
is
infinitely
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
has
a
good
flavor
perfect
for
summer
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
at
9
99
is
a
little
cost
prohibitive
d
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
probably
not
something
id
pick
up
again
especially
at
the
steep
10
a
bottle
not
worth
the
price
not
being
familiar
with
this
beer
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
listed
here
as
a
witbier
as
it
really
doesnt
display
much
of
that
character
in
any
aspect
pretty
clean
though
and
certainly
goes
down
quick
on
a
hot
summer
night
drinkability
its
terribly
easy
to
drink
and
i
wish
it
was
on
tap
around
here
instead
of
the
macro
style
lagers
if
it
were
a
tad
more
crisp
it
would
be
refreshing
and
have
a
higher
score
for
drinkability
pours
just
a
slightly

everything
off
with

very

but
thin
in
palate
brisk
and
refreshing
while
at
the
same
time
a
little
bland
and
boring
overall
ok
good
looking
bottle
like
a
champagne
bottle
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin

minimal
wheat
aroma
taste
is
like
a
bland
impression
of
a
good
belgian
witbier
very
little
of
the
coriandercitrusy
flavor
i
expect
from
the
class
fairly
light
bodied
and
quite
easy
drinking
not
something
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
again
this
beer
was
designed
to
be
paired
with
food
and
while
we
had
rich
os
famous
beer
cheese
and
pizza
i
dont
think
that
we
got
to
see
this
beer
in
its
fullest
because
we
werent
able
to
pair
it
with
the
selections
of
food
it
was
meant
to
pair
that
said
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
would
probably
shine
even
more
in
the
right
environment
with
the
right
gourmet
selections
to
highlight
its
unique
characteristics
avoid
this
isnt
a
stellar
witbier
and
i
would
have
pegged
it
as
a
very
bready
lemony
and
fizzy
lager
but
witbier
it
is
this
was
a
nice
change
up
beer
quite
light
a
bit
floral
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
beer
isnt
brilliant
but
it
was
enjoyable
at
the
time
for
what
it
was
bottle
from
one
of
the

and
interesting
mild
tangy
wheat
with
oranges
and
some
yeastiness
mild
and
dry
not
quite
medium
bodied
but
not
noticeably
thin
either
drinks
quite
well
despite
the
pretentious
bottle
still
not
quite
worth
the
price
tag
while
a
great
all
around
beverage
it
lacks
the
roasted
notes
that
i
like
in
beer
very
smooth
malty
not
exactly
the
holy
grail
of
beers
from
the
spainards
but
not
bad
at
all
d
as
notes
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
blend
of
lager
and
wit
but
actually
it
comes
out
more
as
a
wit
diluted
with
lager
it
doesnt
taste
bad
or
anything
actually
its
kind
of
refreshing
and
it
has
some
nicely
tasting
flavors
but
its
just
boring
the
smell
is
definitely
the
highlight
of
the
beer
and
not
even
that
is
more
than
ok
it
is
no
way
near
of
living
up
to
the
boasting
presented
in
the
cheesy
note
around
the
bottle
neck
i
wouldnt
complain
if
someone
handed
me
a
cold
glass
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
wouldnt
be
terribly
excited
either
certainly
wont
pay
for
it
again
edit
oh
licorice
thats
the
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
that
i
couldnt
place
interesting
unique
twist
taste
of
weak
fruit
grain
coriander
and
some
other
spices
as
the
tag
said
it
was
better
with
food
but
still
lacking
something
drinkability
this
is
another
inoffensive
highly
drinkable
wheat
ale
the
carbonation
stands
out
and
the
flavor
profile
is
good
i
will
probably
not
buy
another
bottle
of
this
but
would
look
for
it
on
draft
i
think
it
would
make
a
good
starter
beer
for
the
style
average
at
best
hardly
drinkable
as
well
too
watery
avoid
notes
glad
to
have
tried
it
but
i
will
not
likely
buy
it
again
just
too
boring
overall
i
have
always
been
convinced
that
most
of
estrellas
creations
are
bad
but
if
only
all
of
their
beers
could
be
this
good
pours
cloudy

a
huge

the
flavor
is

a
little

the
back
white

as
it
warms
apple
notes

quite
pronounced
pours
a
mostly
transparent
pale

good
body
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
imo
i
like
the
idea
of
a
food
beer
i
think
it
should
be
a
little
more
neutral
however
the
banana
bubblegum
flavor
is
almost
overpowering
and
boarding
on
artificial
this
is
a
nice
surprise
from
spain
a
place
i
usually
wouldnt
expect
to
find
a
high
quality
ale
d
drinkable
but
only
worth
having
once
this
beer
has
a
little
booklet
attached
that
says
it
was
brewed
specifically
to
go
with
food
also
says
it
is
brewed
with
coriander
orange
peel
and
licoroice
use
of
both
barley
and
wheat
along
with
bottle
conditioning
alludes
to
a
belgian
style
of
some
sort
or
other
seems
to
be

but
id
guess
around

great
nose
good
body
poor
flavor
this
beer
seems
as
though
it
has
been
poorly
handled
and
has
been
damaged
and
i
dropped
10
50
for
this
sucker
at
whole
foods
ill
have
to
try
it
again
from
another
supplier
pours
a
foggy
yellow
with
a
white
head
nose
is
airy
flavor
is
very
interesting
nice
and
complex
enough
but
light
enough
that
it
keeps
it
food
friendly
as
its
intended
to
be
interesting
aftertaste
thats
worth
noting
almost
like
a
light
honey
thing
floral
and
spice
tones
are
evident
but
the
honey
just
hits
on
numerous
fronts
and
i
like
it
almost
seems
like
theres
a
bit
of
vanilla
there
as
well
even
and
nowhere
near
overpowering
citrus
is
there
as
well
carbonation
feels
a
bit
unusual
its
almost
like
champagne
in
a
way
definitely
not
typical
but
its
not
outlandish
liquid
is
slick
and
smooth
this
is
an
exquisite
beer
portrays
many
characteristics
you
normally
see
in
other
beers
but
delivers
it
in
a
more
refined
way
with
layers
of
character
no
foam
and
a
cloudy
yellow
color
the
smell
is
sickly
sweet
and
the
taste
is
slightly
better
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
cloying
its
not
bad
for
about
12
the
bottle
but
then
its
just
too
much
for
me
just
not
my
kind
of
beer
as
i
dont
care
for
the
sweetness
that
lingers
o
decent
offering
but
not
one
that
i
will
buy
again
just
not
my
type
of
beer
definitely
fruity
but
pomegranate
fruitiness
overshadows
all
other
normal
aspects
of
a
wheat
beer

take
the

poured
from

a

some
initial

it
fades
quickly
leaves
little

vaguely
grapefruity
pomegranate
floral
raspberry
light
but
with
some
artificial
aspects
to
it
and
a
pungent
fruity
character
taste
is
light
pomegranate
is
foremost
syrupy
almost
raspberry
a
bit
sweet
but
not
too
muc
actually
the
wheat
base
is
mild
and
it
is
an
easy
drinking
refresher
light
bodied
with
a
mild
carbonation
detectable
wheat
creaminess
to
it
im
not
crazy
about
this
but
dont
hate
it
either
the
pomegranate
does
come
across
strongly
and
feel
a
bit
forced
and
artificial
but
as
a
complete
package
the
beer
is
alright
dry
citrus
finish
not
a
ton
of
traditional
flavours
but
hey
this
is
meant
to
be
pretty
off
the
wall
not
something
id
drink
everyday
but
could
be
different
one
to
try
light
and
mild
smell
isnt
great
but
the
beer
itself
could
be
worse
some
lemon
and
pomegranate
maybe
would
make
a
good
salad
dressing
picked
up
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
as
a
what
the
hell
because
i
tend
to
like
wheat
beers
even
the
fruit
ones
not
much
on
appearance
kinda
thin
and
not
much
head
not
much
to
speak
about
with
smell
taste
was
also
disappointing
overall
not
a
real
strong
beer
decent
but
nothing
special
probably
will
not
buy
again
of
course
may
be
overly
rough
because
i
drank
it
right
after
a
weihenstephaner
heffeweisbier
so
tough
act
to
follow
o
not
horrible
but
definitely
not
a
witbier
it
wasnt
funky
enough
for
that
passable
overall
i
liked
this
beer
ok
once
i
got
into
it
a
bit
as
the
sorta
offputting
taste
sensation
dissipated
or
i
got
used
to
it
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
offered
but
would
look
to
other
options
if
available
o
i
thought
that
this
beer
had
a
good
balance
because
the
wheat
flavors
masked
out
any
sweetness
from
the
fruit
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
pours
a
light
cloudy
gold
frothy
suds

the
unfiltered
pomegranate
wit
aroma
of

and
a
hint
of

interesting
taste
of

there
is
a
mild
note
of
acidic
fruit
but
really
not
discernibly
pomegranate
fair
amount
of
earthy

pours
an
almost
flat
goldenyellow
favoring
the
flesh
of
a
mango
there
was
a
little
haze
to
it
but
it
seemed
more
like
something
dirty
floating
in
it
than
really
a
wit
or
hefe
type
unfiltered
haze
there
was
no
head
to
this
beer
i
watched
the
pour
and
it
was
done
by
one
of
the
bartenders
that
knows
how
to
pour
a
beer
he
didnt
not
pour
off
the
head
he
poured
it
at
about
75
degrees
and
it
just
formed
nothing
the
smell
was
just
flat
as
well
there
was
tons
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
so
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
carbonation
thing
there
was
maybe
a
whisper
of
fruit
syrup
and
some
maybe
banana
on
top
of
some
cheap
white
bread
the
taste
was
just
a
bunch
of
nothing
overall
i
feared
a
flat
beer
given
the
head
and
the
nose
situation
but
it
was
really
quite
fizzy
too
fizzy
really
there
was
something
that
maybe
wanted
to
be
pomegranate
but
only
came
off
as
flavoring
syrup
there
was
no
wheat
flavor
at
all
and
there
was
this
harsh
hops
flavor
to
it
as
well
no
flavoring
hops
just
a
flat
bitterness
overall
this
beer
was
just
off
sytlistically
it
just
doesnt
work
right
for
either
a
wit
or
a
true
wheat
beer
it
really
was
like
drinking
a
budweiser
with
some
fruit
flavor
to
it
i
may
give
it
another
shot
just
to
be
sure
but
i
just
didnt
like
it

the

the
taste
is
just
grain

a

more
sourness
not
a
lactobacillus

sourness
but
a
citric
sourness
the
bitterness
certainly
seems
toned
down
compared
to
my
prior
review
but
its
still
pretty
brisk
considering
the
style
and
body
i
thought
this
was
much
too
watery
and
lacking
of
flavor
o
a
great
fruit
based
beer
that
is
still
a
beer
overall
this
beer
is
well
balanced
m
light
mouthfeel
nothing
left
on
the
tongue
not
too
effervescent
a
very
good
summer
beer
but
i
dont
think
id
drink
this
if
i
werent
at
a
bbq
or
on
the
beach
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amout
of
carbonation
a
nice
fruity
summertime
offering
that
isnt
overdone
with
the
fruit
inclusion
but
the
buttery
notes
need
to
go
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
every
brew
i
enjoyed
this
while
sitting
on
the
beach
under
other
circumstances
maybe
i
wouldnt
have
enjoyed
this
as
much
as
i
did
overall
i
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
with
this
but
its
not
bad
at
all
ill
probably
never
have
it
again
but
its
good
enough
to
not
regret
a
six
pack
worth
a
try
if
you
like
fruit
beers
or
wheat
beers
refreshing
vibe
of
subdued
fruitiness
that
lingers
quietly
solid
enough
for
an
affordable

o
definitely
not
a
january
beer
but
i
wasnt
really
in
the
mood
for
a
porter
or
imperial
stout
i
need
to
study
tonight
wondering
what
else
fort
collins
offers
meant
to
be
a
summer
beer
but
im
not
sure
i
would
even
enjoy
it
then
smells
sour
from
the
pomegranate
juice
and
a
little
bready
from
the
yeast
tart
and
off
a
little
taste
is
a
more
intense
version
of
the
smell
really
funky
juicy
vibe
clashing
with
a
wheat
base
not
nice
at
all
these
flavors
are
just
not
complimentary
here
mouthfeel
is
fine
but
the
tartness
sort
of
dries
out
the
mouth
not
what
i
would
be
looking
for
on
a
summer
day
here
on
the
front
range
for
collins
makes
some
excellent
beer
but
this
isnt
one
of
them
d
surprisingly
one
of
fcbs
best
brews
very
nice
overall
example
of
the
style
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
white
fingers
worth
of
head
the
retention
was
not
very
good
and
it
left
thin
bands
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
citrusy
hops
tart
fruit
pale
malt
and
wheat
the
flavors
were
very
tart
with
notes
of
pomegranate
berries
citrusy
hops
and
a
twang
of
wheat
it
tasted
off
to
me
however
too
tart
and
misbalanced
i
wonder
if
it
was
not
stored
properly
or
just
didnt
age
well
i
feel
it
should
be
better
than
the
example
i
had
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
thin
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
average
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
reasonable
sized
cream
colored
head
that
dissapates
to
a
slight
film
over
the
brew
light
lacing
berry
aroma
with
light
wheat
reminds
me
of
a
fruit
juice
the
taste
definitely
displays
some
pomegranate
i
think
but
has
a
wheat
backbone
on
the
swallow
tangy
almost
harsh
finish
with
some
rindlike
characteristics
juicy
comes
to
mind
as
well
overall
i
applaud
the
effort
to
add
pomegranate
to
beer
but
this
and
most
fruit
beers
was
just
soso
for
me
maybe
if
it
was
80
and
sunny
right
now
i
could
have
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
for
those
looking
for
a
fruit
beer
or
a
wheat
beer
or
a
session
beer
or
a
oh
hell
just
move
on
to
something
else
you
probably
couldnt
do
much
worse
isnt
that
right
major
tom
o
its
a
nice
effort
to
combine
the
wheat
with
pomegranate
but
i
dont
think
it
works
it
is
a
nice
beer
to
give
a
try
but
i
wont
have
another
overall
this
is
an
ok
fruit
beer
while
i
cant
say
i
love
it
its
more
interesting
than
i
thought
it
would
be
d
i
long
for
a
little
hops
to
play
second
note
to
the
pomegranate
overall
a
bland
experience
pomegranate
in
beer
is
a
good
idea
but
this
one
needs
major
refining
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
impressive
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
orange
with
a
small
12
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
distinct
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
spices
and
crushed
pomegranate
arils
taste
is
of
wheat
bread
and
some
bitter
pomegranate
flavors
on
the
finish
the
bitterness
is
mild
and
quickly
fades
the
mouthfeel
on
this
one
is
crisp
and
bubbly
overall
this
is
a
decent
fruited
beer
with
more
of
an
emphasis
on
the
bitterness
found
in
some
pomegranates
rather
than
a
sweetness
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
white
fluffy
head
on
top
the
lacing
was
minimal
on
this
brew
and
not
really
that
impressive
the
smell
of
the
beer
was
fruity
and
had
some
aromas
of
fresh
grains
in
there
too
the
taste
has
a
tart
pomegranate
flavor
to
it
the
flavor
also
settles
into
a
slight
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
pretty
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
a
decent
fruit
beer
im
not
big
on
this
specific
fruit
so
i
probably
wont
need
to
drink
it
again
final
thought
not
bad
either
o
great
for
a
sweet
fruity
beer
which
are
usually
not
my
favorite
nice
fruit
taste
without
all
of
the
sugary
rush
that
goes
with
it
o
light
refreshing
beer
to
drink
during
a
hot
summer
day
would
have
liked
more
pomegranate
flavor
to
come
through
overall
not
a
bad
little
beer
i
think
the
first
sip
you
take
the
flavor
kind
of
shocks
the
palate
but
each
sip
afterwards
became
more
and
more
enjoyable
dr
maybe
they
should
use
real
pomegranate
juice
instead
of
concentrate
its
very
affordable
here
in
colorado
but
not
horribly
drinkable
on
account
of
the
coarseness
its
worth
a
try
but
i
wont
get
it
again
poured
golden
with
the
barest
touch
of
haze
up
front
wheat
character
is
clean
and
straightforward
along
the
american
pale
wheat
style
what
i
suppose
is
the
pomegranate
kicks
in
midway
through
although
i
was
not
able
to
discern
any
particular
flavor
of
that
fruit
what
did
present
was
a
bit
artificial
bittersweetness
with
the
sweet
aspect
almost
hinting
at
belgian
candy
sugar
or
immitation
belgian
candy
sugar
drinkable
but
not
particularly
enjoyable
o
this
is
a
hot
weather
beer
and
this
is
the
only
time
id
ever
drink
it
however
there
is
a
ton
in
the
wit
category
at
a
similar
price
thats
better
the
pomegranate
adjunct
could
make
it
a
try
if
you
enjoy
that
fruit
overall
well
i
wouldnt
say
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
as
mentioned
i
was
really
hoping
for
a
stronger
fruit
presence
kind
of
like
how
dfh
does
the
aprihop
decent
flavors
though
in
the
end
and
it
is
a
pretty
refreshing
summer
drink
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
little
head
nose
offers
wheat
and
yeast
but
i
dont
pick
up
a
strong
fruit
presence
little
if
any
pomegranate
in
the
nose
taste
offers
a
little
more
fruit
but
mainly
in
the
finish
the
pomegranate
is
overall
very
faint
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
highly
carbonated
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
in
this
one
but
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
summer
deh
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
im
really
not
enjoying
this
one
all
that
much
the
pomegranate
is
barely
there
and
fruit
wheat
beers
arent
my
favorite
style
pretty
refreshing
and
drinkable
if
not
unremarkable
decent
summer
beer
here
not
much
to
really
think
about
when
drinking
it
tastewheat
subtle
fruit
tartness
refreshing
subtle
flavors
nothing
overdone
a
decent
different
refreshing
hot
weather
brew
overall
it
is
lacking
smell
good
in
flavor
great
in
feel
not
a
bad
drink
i
this
is
my
first
review
on
this
site
so
please
if
you
have
any
advice
message
me
thanks
not
sure
if
im
being
harsh
on
this
one
but
first
of
all
this
is
not
a
witbeer
no
orange
no
coriander
and
no
yeast
character
whatsoever
in
addition
that
sulfite
addition
is
not
adding
to
the
illusion
of
pomegranate
in
this
its
an
average
wheat
beer
exposed
to
a
chemistry
fair
volcano
on
the
brightside
fcb
finally
proves
to
me
they
can
produce
a
beer
that
is
actually
carbonated
golf
claps
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
spices
and
orange
zest
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
fruit
and
subtle
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
that
was
about
it
it
was
slightly
spicy
for
the
style
or
at
least
what
im
used
in
this
style
wasnt
really
sure
what
to
make
of
it
good
or
bad
i
honestly
wouldnt
have
guessed
this
to
be
a
witbier
but
rather
a
spicedherbed
style
highly
doubt
i
will
be
having
this
one
again
tasty
and
refreshing
enough
but
nothing
special
and
in
particular
no
real
pomegranate
flavors
overall
if
youd
like
to
try
a
pom
wheat
i
recommend
saranacs
ive
heard
fcb
has
good
beers
but
this
missed
the
cut
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
nice
its
crisp
and
wellcarbonated
the
drinkability
eh
its
decent
but
theres
no
reason
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
theres
really
nothing
here
to
enjoy
i
might
have
a
bad
bottle
because
the
floaties
dont
seem
to
be
mentioned
by
any
other
review
id
try
it
again
but
wouldnt
be
fooled
twice
saranacs
pomegranate
wheat
is
much
better
golden
with
a
bit
of
haze
and
plenty
of
carbonation
the
head
quickly
disappears
sweet
honey
like
aroma
good
amount
of
carbonation
on
first
sip
the
fruit
comes
out
in
the
middle
with
a
bit
of
sourness
nice
amount
of
hops
in
the
back
in
the
end
the
sour
and
bitter
clash
making
for
an
odd
finish
medium
body
its
a
little
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
high
marks
for
drinkability
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
definitely
go
for
more
d
very
drinkable
and
goes
down
easy
value
pricey
as
heck
for
what
it
is
a
mediumbodied
brew
with
a
watery
dry
finish
medium
effervescence
overall
a
decent
beer
but
just
a
middle
of
the
road
one
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
not
sure
how
a
fruity
wheat
beer
can
be
sweet
and
bitter
this
could
be
better
pomegranate
is
a
wonderful
fruit
to
brew
with
i
use
it
once
in
a
while
in
my
homebrew
witbier
and
its
great
with
a
little
work
they
can
greatly
improve
this
beer
d
ones
plenty
for
me
thanks
even
by
style
and
not
enough
to
recommend
even
a
single
purchase
here
not
really
sure
where
this
beer
was
going
but
it
seemed
to
fall
flat
other
than
an
ok
american
wheat
ale
flavor
as
for
the
fruit
and
sulfites
the
fruit
missed
the
mark
and
why
are
sulfites
used
keep
that
to
wine
and
cider
please
not
sure
how
true
this
is
to
its
wheat
lable
as
i
dont
care
for
wheats
and
i
find
this
one
quite
likeable
soso
average
wit
but
the
pomegranate
did
nothing
for
me
d
well
thankfully
i
only
had
four
of
them
which
were
not
much
of
a
chore
to
consume
but
i
really
would
have
rather
had
saranac
pomme
offering
drinkability
an
obvious
easy
drinker
a
bit
too
tart
for
me
for
a
witbier
but
i
can
see
the
appeal
d
this
beer
honestly
didnt
do
much
for
me
a
bit
too
harsh
in
the
middle
for
me
to
truly
enjoy
it
the
lightness
however
makes
it
go
down
quick
i
feel
that
these
guys
know
how
to
make
a
great
fruit
beer
but
this
one
isnt
my
favorite
i
just
wanted
it
lighter
on
the
grain
great
use
of
pomegranate
either
way
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
when
a
beer
is
mislabeled
or
improperly
categorized
by
the
brewer
it
will
always
receive
low
scores
from
me
even
if
it
does
taste
good
this
is
because
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
stout
and
i
buy
something
labeled
stout
i
expect
a
stout
likewise
i
expected
a
wheat
ale
and
i
didnt
get
one
therefore
im
left
disappointed
i
dont
mean
this
to
offend
but
its
the
truth
i
honestly
adore
fort
collins
brewery
unfortunately
they
have
disappointed
me
with
this
offering
first
sip
is
very
sweet
with
a
bit
of
husky
graininess
on
the
aftertaste
no
hops
to
speak
of
not
that
they
would
be
expected
sweetness
is
very
powerful
but
not
overpowering
there
is
a
distinction
the
pomegranate
barely
pokes
through
there
is
a
little
too
much
residual
sweetness
for
my
liking
but
i
detect
no
off
flavors
or
major
negatives
this
is
just
a
beer
that
i
only
tried
because
i
had
it
as
part
of
a
sampler
i
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
of
this
on
its
own
both
before
or
after
ive
tasted
it
d
bitter
and
tart
no
refreshing
wheat
character
and
let
me
just
say
that
pomegranate
has
no
place
in
beer
this
is
pilot
material
not
the
breweryflagship
beer
pours
a
fairly
standard
clear
amber
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
white
head
typical
but
not
offputting
aroma
is
yeasty
and
wheaty
with
a
decided
fruity
overtone
flavor
is
mainly
of
pomegranate
which
i
love
and
has
malty
and
yeasty
undertones
it
is
slightly
sweet
and
slightly
hopbitter
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
and
it
leaves
an
edgy
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
not
great
but
worth
a
try
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
its
not
the
predictable
fruity
wheat
beer
that
i
was
expecting
a
nice
bit
of
bitterness
and
tartness
gives
it
a
real
balance
again
not
a
terrible
beer
not
a
great
one
either
just
terribly
mislabeled
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
one
finger
head
that
stays
around
the
smell
is
very
weak
there
is
a
bit
of
wheat
and
a
slight
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
enjoyable
but
not
over
powering
the
taste
is
of
a
wheat
backbone
with
a
pom
note
over
the
top
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
taste
is
smooth
and
subtle
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
was
a
great
purchase
at
2
00
on
the
single
rack
i
dont
see
myself
buying
the
6pack
on
a
regular
basis
unless
its
spring
its
surely
a
light
and
flavorful
beer
that
would
be
better
tasted
during
a
season
other
than
winter
still
a
great
beer
cheers
wheat
ale
with
pomergranate
juice
concentrate
not
exactly
something
i
would
seek
to
drink
it
is
an
attractive
beer
with
a
clear
golden
body
and
large
head
that
had
good
retention
the
head
eventually
settles
to
a
thick
cap
moderate
amount
of
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
of
wheat
malt
and
some
fruit
than
i
could
not
peg
as
pomergranate
the
flavor
is
rather
mild
had
a
natural
flavor
as
i
was
afraid
that
like
a
lot
of
added
flavor
beers
they
taste
artificial
just
a
hint
of
pomergranate
which
also
gives
some
bitterness
a
lighter
body
and
well
matched
carbonation
feels
right
for
the
style
a
decent
beer
and
would
be
a
good
drinker
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
color
13
inch

of
a
white

decent
retention
and
decent

a
hint
of

the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
wheat
hops
sweet
malt
slight
citrus
and
grain
overall
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
not
well
blended
and
the
grain
leaves
an
odd
aftertaste
beer
poured
golden
with
a
shade
of
red
in
the
undertone
nose
is
good
fruity
with
hints
of
floral
hops
taste
is
actually
pretty
good
the
pom
flavoring
plays
well
as
a
bittering
element
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
decently
carbonated
for
a
refreshing
finish
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
this
is
a
nice
twist
on
the
wheat
style
of
beer
not
overly
sweet
this
is
worthy
of
a
shot
d
definitely
average
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
snd
recedes
very
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
pale
malt
and
pomegranate
juice
there
is
nothing
in
this
aroma
that
indicates
it
is
a
wheat
beer
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
with
a
little
wheaty
tang
still
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
the
mouthfeel
mediumlight
bodied
with
a
velvety
texture
and
moderately
high
carbonation
it
is
actually
a
really
nice
mouthfeel
overall
this
style
of
fruit
beer
is
way
overdone
this
particular
beer
is
average
at
best
i
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
this
again
d
really
good
if
in
the
mood
for
a
touch
of
sweet
this
is
one
of
the
better
fruitwheat
beers
ive
had
i
wasnt
expecting
much
i
even
though
this
was
going
to
be
old
and
stale
but
it
tastes
quite
fresh
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
beer
must
be
a
filtered
witbier
because
it
is
perfectly
clear
and
golden
in
appearance
with
a
thin
creamy
looking
cap
looks
more
like
a
macro
lager
than
a
micro
witbier
the
nose
is
surprisingly
hop
dominant
with
a
mild
slightly
toasted
malt
backdrop
and
only
a
faint
whiff
of
fruitiness
which
i
will
attribute
to
the
pomegranate
it
is
not
much
more
apparent
in
the
taste
other
than
in
the
presence
of
a
tart
acidic
flavor
but
the
fact
that
it
is
pomegranate
is
indistinguishable
there
is
a
definite
wheatyness
to
it
as
well
as
a
lightly
toasted
malt
flavor
victory
maybe
the
beer
is
also
well
balanced
with
hops
and
finishes
neutral
with
the
tart
acidity
i
previously
mentioned
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
thin
yet
smooth
and
creamy
carbonation
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
not
bad
my
only
let
down
with
this
beer
is
the
advertisement
of
pomegranate
which
as
i
mentioned
is
indistinguishable
if
they
just
called
this
major
toms
wheat
ale
i
think
my
opinion
of
it
would
have
been
much
more
positive
overall
this
was
better
than
i
anticipated
although
i
must
say
its
much
better
before
it
gets
much
above
50
deg
f
drink
this
one
fast
d
i
am
not
generally
a
fan
of
fruit
beer
but
this
the
subdued
sweetness
and
dry
finish
make
this
one
very
drinkable
d
a
pretty
original
take
on
the
wheat
not
bad
by
any
means
just
not
quite
what
i
seek
in
a
beer
pretty
refreshing
and
drinkable
overall
although
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
super
easy
drinker
so
smooth
very
flavorful
i
like
this
a
whole
lot
better
than
most
wits
really
really
nice
summer
beer
drinkabiltiy
is
so
so
while
it
is
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
and
i
wuld
never
turn
down
a
free
one
overall
its
just
blah
taste
was
pretty
clean
slightly
fruity
finished
very
clean
and
refreshing
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
great
beer
for
summertime
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
am
always
tentative
with
wheat
beers
but
this
one
is
outstanding
it
comes
off
as
pale
ale
more
than
a
wheat
and
that
is
probably
why
very
good
balance
and
taste
i
think
the
overall
rating
is
a
diservice
to
its
strengths
and
maybe
i
just
got
a
good
batch
ill
report
back
when
i
try
it
again
if
its
different
d
could
be
very
drinkable
but
the
pom
is
a
little
too
bitter
for
my
taste
it
is
worth
a
try
if
you
are
looking
for
something
a
little
different
d
as
you
go
through
the
hop
profile
fades
a
little
bit
and
mellows
maybe
i
just
got
used
to
the
taste
would
be
good
for
a
cookout
or
the
4th
of
july
something
in
warm
weather
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
this
regularly
though
d
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
but
the
alcohol
was
a
little
too
present
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
however
the
alcohol
despite
being
low
was
fairly
present
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
and
i
felt
that
took
away
a
little
bit
from
the
experience
of
drinking
this
one
as
well
as
your
ability
to
drink
the
style
during
the
warmer
days
d
the
drinkability
for
this
one
is
pretty
good
it
would
make
a
solid
session
beer
worth
a
shot
pours
a
light
straw
golden
slightly
hazed
with
chill
bright
white
foaming
head
dwindles
pretty
quickly
leaving
behind
even
fine
patterns
of
lace
aromatics
are
not
what
i
was
expecting
fruit
beers
usually
equate
to
sticky
sweet
messes
in
the
smell
this
smells
like
an
actual
beer
even
has
some
hop
aroma
to
it
nice
pale
cereal
grains
provided
biscuit
malt
sweetness
with
a
grassy
background
of
hops
and
a
mildly
tart
fruit
pomegranate
character
going
on
flavor
has
the
tart
earthy
sweet
pomegranate
extract
twang
but
again
its
all
built
upon
a
solid
brewed
beer
sharp
wheat
sweetness
nothing
too
fizzy
or
cloying
moderate
balanced
flow
to
it
all
its
sweet
slightly
tart
with
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
finishing
off
the
beer
a
really
even
experience
mouthfeel
is
not
cloying
or
sticky
with
residual
sugars
crisp
sturdy
carbonation
but
a
very
natural
feel
to
it
light
to
medium
bodied
overall
this
is
quality
fruit
beer
drinkability
i
enjoy
everything
fort
collins
is
putting
out
they
make
one
of
the
best
sampler
packs
out
there
every
style
comes
to
play
and
they
do
them
quite
well
d
meh
i
guess
fruited
wheats
just
arnt
for
me
i
dont
think
ill
be
checking
this
one
out
again
it
isnt
offensive
its
just
not
my
thing
d
not
bad
at
first
i
though
this
beer
was
fairly
awful
but
by
the
end
of
the
glass
it
had
grown
on
me
the
fruit
flavor
is
pleasant
and
actually
blends
well
with
the
wheat
i
still
cant
say
i
am
a
fan
of
fruited
wheat
beers
but
this
is
drinkable
enjoyed
on
tap
at
303
cafe
in
east
boston
drinkability
a
light
wheat
ale
with
a
light
addition
of
fruit
charge
it
with
an
ample
hop
bitterness
and
nigh
fizzy
carbonation
and
you
have
yourself
major
toms
pomegranate
wheat
overall
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
will
have
many
again
will
be
especially
nice
on
hot
summer
day
pours
light
amber
with
no
head
not
quite
what
i
expect
from
a
wheat
beer
smells
of
artificial
fruit
sugar
and
some
sour
like
a
cheap
candy
similar
in
the
mouth
starts
bitter
and
artificial
and
progresses
to
thin
watery
sour
and
insipid
with
a
metallic
tang
on
the
finish
sharp
and
prickly
in
the
mouth
this
one
is
a
drain
pour
for
me
d
just
a
little
too
sourtart
for
me
has
a
strong
grapefruit
character
and
i
wish
the
pomegranate
would
have
shined
more
not
as
smooth
as
typical
wheats
amber
yellow
with
some
visable
suspended
particles
and
a
massive
foamy
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
kind
of
bitter
fruity
must
be
the
pomegranate
in
there
also
some
caramel
maltiness
tastes
weird
as
the
bitterness
comes
from
the
actual
fruit
instead
of
hops
tasting
like
grapefruit
not
terrible
tasting
but
not
true
to
the
style
at
all
are
we
sure
this
is
a
witbier
seltzery
slick
mouthfeel
a
strange
brew
d
easy
drinking
a
nice
summer
beer
though
the
sweetness
may
get
tiring
strangely
enough
not
real
smooth
going
down
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
very
mild
kick
not
a
good
representation
of
style
there
just
wasnt
very
much
in
this
beer
that
i
found
favorable
okay
i
dont
know
about
this
one
the
pomegranite
juice
is
prominate
in
this
beer
almost
too
overpowering
i
really
could
deal
without
drinking
this
one
i
believe
my
friend
and
i
had
about
the
same
reaction
to
this
beer
let
me
try
something
else
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
mind
you
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
this
is
my
second
fcbc
beer
and
both
have
been
horrible
summer
fling
is
the
other
this
one
does
not
taste
at
all
like
pomegranates
nor
does
it
have
much
of
a
noticeable
wheat
crispness
or
zing
there
is
a
very
good
chance
this
will
be
my
last
fort
collins
beer
just
atrocious
d
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
dont
drink
and
review
drinkability
with
this
is
fine
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
im
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
soso
in
my
book
as
this
did
not
refresh
nor
did
it
excite
the
tastebuds
the
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
oily
wheres
the
wheat
the
hops
are
overly
prominent
and
the
fruit
is
intense
this
is
not
a
witbier
its
not
bad
but
its
not
a
wit
the
taste
is
crisp
and
typical
of
a
wheaty
beer
but
where
is
the
pomegranate
there
is
a
slightly
sweetish
tint
to
the
beer
that
segues
into
a
more
dryish
and
crisp
tartness
as
the
beer
settles
but
im
just
not
getting
loads
of
pomegranate
maybe
thats
not
such
a
bad
thing
the
beer
is
a
decent
slightly
sweeter
than
normal
wheat
beer
with
a
tartness
and
a
crispness
that
is
its
defining
qualities
its
an
okay
beer
and
thats
all
one
can
say
dtoo
bitter
and
funky
for
immediate
repeats
i
appreciate
this
beer
but
i
dont
want
to
have
more
than
one
pours
a
transparent
yellow
orange
color
with
an
enormous
white
head
aromas
of
soap
and
artificial
fruit
in
the
nose
pomegranate
sure
doesnt
jump
out
at
you
more
like
over
ripe
and
sour
plums
green
apple
and
tart
berry
tart
in
the
mouth
as
well
fake
fruit
concentrate
again
dominates
the
flavor
here
tingly
with
a
metallic
taste
on
the
tongue
no
true
pleasurable
wheat
character
to
speak
of
and
an
ear
wax
like
aftertaste
avoid
this
beer
if
you
must
drink
a
fruit
beer
there
are
better
options
than
this
pours
a
clear
yellowhoney
color
with
a
smallish
white
head
not
a
really
great
looking
brew
the
smell
is
weak
with
only
some
sweet
malt
and
bread
yeast
present
the
taste
is
crisp
with
sweet
malt
bread
yeast
and
some
fruit
flavors
the
mf
is
light
with
the
scant
flavors
mixing
ok
not
a
bad
beerbut
from

would
expect
more

this
beers
body
is
blonde
and
hazy
there
is
a
lot
of
head
but
not
much
for
lace
it
has
wheat
and
fruit
aroma
so
i
guess
one
could
say
it
is
true
to
its
style
i
thought
it
did
not
taste
like
a
wheat
beer
at
all
it
was
more
like
pale
ale
in
taste
it
has
a
very
sweet
and
tart
flavor
it
is
refreshing
and
light
and
i
would
recommended
it
for
a
summer
beer
easy
and
light
aroma
of
malts
and
pomegranate
kinda
of
a
spicy
orange
mango
in
this
one
quaff
is
exactly
the
same
light
and
easy
drinking
a
very
nice
summer
brew
to
quaff
in
the
heat
a
very
nice
crossover
try
this
one
beer
no
problem
sipping
on
a
sixer
d
this
beer
doesnt
have
any
major
flaws
it
is
just
bland
there
are
no
real
yeasty
characteristics
or
wheat
or
hop
flavors
now
this
beer
is
not
offensive
but
i
just
fail
to
see
any
upside
to
it
the
color
a
golden
clear
beer
no
wheat
beer
haze
or
large
fluffy
head
the
scent
is
sour
atop
a
whiff
of
malt
sweetness
not
smooth
or
tart
but
oddly
sour
in
an
unpleasant
way
the
taste
is
similar
with
little
complexity
or
depth
of
character
mouthfeel
is
thin
i
would
not
drink
another
body

to
be

some

straw
and
an
aroma
of
biscuits

malty
and
sweet
with
a
bit
of
lemon
and
possibly
pomegranate
makes
sense
thrown
in
a
slightly
bitter
finish
its
crisp
but
has
a
certain
almost
indiscernible
breadiness
that
rounds
off
the
edges
a
good
wheat
beer
that
could
probably
use
a
bit
more
gusto
in
the
taste
department
but
will
go
a
long
way

actually
went

i

no

not

as
they
usually
overdo
it

this
one
had
a

this

overall
i
recognize
that
this
beer
is
very
complex
particularly
for
the
style
but
for
me
it
misses
the
mark
dfh
has
blended
wine
characteristics
with
beer
very
well
in
the
past
but
the
end
result
here
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
also
admittingly
reflected
in
the
rating
is
the
pricetag
at
15
i
couldve
done
a
lot
better
bottle
of
red
and
white
drank
light
to
medium
bodied
with
average
carbonation
a
nice
beer
which
i
will
seek
out
again
this
is
a
very
pretty
beer
with
the
red
body
and
blonde
bubbly
head
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
i
wish
i
had
written
down
the
tasting
notes
at
the
time
however
looking
back
on
the
brew
i
think
what
stood
out
most
is
its
mild
sweetness
and
the
unity
of
all
of
its
components
i
am
surprised
this
beer
isnt
rated
higher
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
sipping
this
beer
a
bit
of
orange
zest
with
a
nice
sour
note
from
the
wine
grapes
the
oakiness
comes
through
but
not
in
an
overpowering
way
to
me
it
lends
to
the
dryness
of
the
beer
overall
very
complex
beer
and
hard
to
wrap
your
arms
around
but
in
a
good
way
wonderful
depth
of
flavors
the
grape
juice
really
plays
well
with
the
predominant
orange
zest
and
spiciness
of
the
witbier
oak
barrels
are
a
nice
touch
in
that
it
gives
the
beer
a
dry
finish
like
a
fine
red
wine
enjoyable
malt
bill
and
yeast
strain
only
adds
in
more
complexity
and
depth

i
buy

not

really
interesting
beer
you
get
the
orange
and
coriander
and
then
a
smack
of
the
wine
worth
a
taste
not
bad
i
think
this
is
only
the
second
double
wit
ive
ever
tried
i
enjoyed
the
white
wine
addition
nice
complexity
with
the
simple
syrup
sweetness
lifting
its
pinot
character
thrives
in
the
late
palate
highlighted
by
vinous
alcohol
with
its
own
peppery
warmth
but
closing
with
a
semisweet
weight
the
ale
remains
much
more
of
a
sipping
beer
than
a
drinkable
one
mild
bitterness
and
rosy
spice
gives
this
high
gravity
wheat
beer
a
hearty
prickle
on
the
tongue
as
it
exits
very
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
of
great
fruit
flavors
the
appearance
was
a
nice
reddish
orange
hue
with
a
thick
head
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
smell
had
a
lot
of
blackberry
and
grape
flavor
from
the
pinot
noir
very
subtle
the
taste
was
full
of
fruit
in
a
good
way
with
a
lot
of
the
wine
flavor
coming
through
in
the
finish
giving
a
semisweet
lingering
to
it
thought
it
was
a
nice
after
dinner
beer
good
with
rich
deserts
overall
a
very
good
twist
on
a
belgian
style
wheat
beer
huge
fruit
taste
from
the
added
grapes
and
a
nice
hint
of
oak
its
almost
like
an
imperial
hefeweizen
with
the
big
bubblegum
taste
this
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
mild
with
coriander
and
hints
of
fermented
grapes
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
and
fruity
with
the
nicely
blended
combination
of
wine
and
coriander
that
delivers
a
rather
interesting
taste
add
this
to
your
list
of
must
tries
o
red
white
delivers
on
everything
it
claims
and
am
happy
to
see
dfh
keep
this
in
their
profile
the
biggest
downside
is
the
price
12

if
you
are
fan
of
belgian

beers
especially
golden
strong
or
tripels

with
some

thrown
in

up

this
will
be
right
up

alley

not
overwhelming
the

barrelstave
aging
is
what
really
makes
this
beer
special
although
dfh
claims
this
to
be
a
great
beer
for
aging
i
feel
that
all
the
flavors
like
burton
are
most
pungent
and
enjoyed
fresh
exception
being
the
alcohol
presence
of
which
would
probably
mellow

beerandwhiskeyhq
com
a
really
wonderful
beer
this
bottles
been
in
my
cellar
for
a
year
and
has
developed
wonderfully
i
had
this
on
tap
a
while
back
and
it
was
just
as
much
of
a
great
experience
been
looking
forwards
to
this
one
but
at
the
same
time
i
probably
would
not
of
purchased
if
i
known
the
style
but
anyways
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
hue
with
an
off
white
two
finger
head
and
lacing
everywherethe
smell
is
suprisingly
subdued
but
i
do
get
aromas
of
oakboozeblue
cheese
and
strong
corianderthe
feel
is
full
bodied
with
light
carbonation
and
has
strong
tastes
of
your
typical
witbier
character
with
orange
peelscoriander
and
sweet
wheat
and
finished
with
a
mix
of
toffee
sweetness
and
red
wine
dryness
and
overall
another
beer
im
glad
ive
tried
but
it
doesnt
really
set
my
palette
on
fire
so
i
wont
be
buying
again
cheers
the
feel
started
out
very
smooth
but
then
a
carbonation
bite
hit
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
this
is
a
great
brew
it
is
very
smooth
and
complex
the
alcohol
is
present
in
the
aroma
but
are
not
present
in
the
taste
i
loved
the
refined
feeling
this
is
a
real
nice
brew
that
i
overlook
from
dogfish
i
need
to
make
a
note
to
have
this
around
more
often
for
consumption
o
their
black
and
blue
is
much
better
it
is
actually
quite
similar
to
the
kvasir
o
tasty
overall
but
i
think
it
could
show
more
complexity
with
a
lower
abv
overall
solid
witbier
i
havent
had
it
in
a
while
but
it
is
very
delicious
ill
make
sure
i
have
it
more
often
this
was
a
nice
beer
but
not
anything
too
out
of
the
ordinary
as
it
drank
i
began
to
appreciate
it
more
pour
a
hazy
orange
with
some
sticky
white
head
sediment

be
seen
settling
smell
is
very
fruitfilled
lots
of
grapes
apple
strawberries
and
citrus
some
yeast
but
not
overbearing
delicious
beer
all
the
same
fruit
flavors
come
though
with
some
honey
sweetness
tastes
like
a
fruity
wit
while
the
grapes
are
evident
the
specific
varietal
would
be
hard
to
pick
out
from
taste
alone
feel
is
very
good
moderate
carbonation
and
it
is
slightly
creamy
good
beer
another
nice
trip
off
the
beaten
path
from
dfh
overall
inferior
flavor
to
the
61
that
came
out
a
few
months
back
but
still
drinkable
and
gives
you
a
lot
to
sort
through
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
bright
wit
like
carbonation
super
effervescent
but
the
body
stays
consistent
throughout
sweet
orange
fruitiness
up
front
with
some
other
tropical
fruitiness
the
sweetness
is
immediately
offset
by
tart
vinous
character
and
a
touch
of
wood
long
red
wine
like
finish
drying
oak
touch
of
alcohol
and
mildly
tannic
incredibly
complex
with
a
wide
array
of
flavors
that
all
all
layered
very
well
ive
said
it
before
and
ill
say
it
again
10
witbiers
can
go
away
forever
forever
in
my
best
yoda
voice
no
purpose
does
this
serve
o
great
brew
overall
if
there
was
one
single
word
to
describe
this
beer
it
would
be
elegant
followed
by
finesse
it
doesnt
have
the
greatest
flavours
in
the
world
but
i
can
taste
the
level
of
craftmanship
that
has
gone
into
this
brew
overall
this
is
a
tasty
beer
but
like
some
dogfish
beers
im
not
really
sure
the
abv
needs
to
be
this
high
i
think
turning
it
down
a
notch
would
actually
beneficial
to
this
one
oshouldnt
be
enjoyed
as
a
witbier
but
rather
as
a
higher
gravity
dogfish
concoction
its
not
a
stand
out
in
any
other
style
and
its
probably
not
something
youll
ever
crave
but
as
the
very
occasional
beer
to
wind
down
with
one
could
do
worse
i
suppose
i
love
a
lot
of
dfh
beers
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
ive
recently
had
2
of
their
beers
i
wont
seek
out
again
this
is
one
of
them
final
thoughts
id
say
im
happy
with
this
one
but
not
my
favorite
dfh
great
for
the
style
though
would
i
drink
it
again
cant
say
id
pass
it
up
can
see
where
this
is
a
lovehate
not
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
for
me
maybe
a
whiff
of
grape
attractive
orange
color
with
thick
head
on
pour
the
apparent
lack
of
aroma
lead
to
a
surprise
in
the
taste
wasnt
expecting
much
somewhat
sweet
a
little
thick
on
the
mouth
feel
can
taste
the
wine
notesgrapes
for
sure
but
some
nice
citrusy
notes
to
balance
it
off
sweet
but
not
heavily
so
some
warmth
from
the
alcohol
thought
this
was
wellbalanced
overall
it
was
a
great
change
of
pace
and
would
probably
go
great
with
a
cheesemeat
plate
or
as
a
meal
accompaniment
kind
of
thoughtful
tasting
if
that
makes
any
sense
tasted
it
and
went
hmmm
or
said
interesting
several
times
during
consumption
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
many
facets
although
i
may
not
like
all
the
facets
presented
its
still
a
pretty
good
beer
when
i
poured
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
honey
colored
body
with
a
nice
2
finger
head
that
hangs
out
for
a
couple
of
minutes
until
it
lays
down
to
a
thin
lace
the
smell
has
some
belgium
yeast
and
a
winegrapes
smell
to
it
the
taste
has
winegrape
taste
up
front
also
i
get
a
little
spice
of
coriander
and
some
citrus
closer
to
the
back
of
the
tonuge
some
dark
fruits
are
present
also
it
defently
has
a
very
complex
taste
on
your
taste
buds
the
mouth
feel
is
goodvery
nice
carobonation
and
is
a
little
heavy
but
not
to
heavy
though
and
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wne
flavored
beers
but
this
one
is
really
good
and
i
think
it
is
at
least
worth
trying
once
o
an
epic
beer
very
smooth
well
balanced
and
very
complex
complex
flavors
which
linger
forever
one
of
the
brews
which
sent
me
over
the
moon
the
time
of
a
drink
highly
recommended
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
the
description
of
it
sounded
like
a
brilliant
and
delicious
concoction
i
like
witbiers
and
i
like
red
wine
it
seems
natural
i
would
enjoy
a
beverage
that
tries
to
combine
the
best
of
both
unfortunately
i
do
not
i
will
say
that
i
believe
this
beer
has
an
intense
and
complex
flavor
profile
and
tastes
exactly
the
way
the
brewer
wants
it
to
taste
i
am
sure
it
will
please
a
lot
of
people
i
am
disappointed
that
i
am
not
one
of
them
this
is
a
nice
complex
brew
from
dfh
but
a
night
after
drinking
a
deconstruction
from
odell
any
other
blended
wine
barrel
beer
just
isnt
going
to
match
up
the
appearance
is
cumin
powder
dullish
yellow
in
color
with
some
haze
and
an
aroused
white
head
a
ciouple
inches
high
the
nose
is
corriander
and
orange
right
off
the
bat
ive
smelled
this
many
times
before
but
then
comes
the
tannins
from
the
vino
tart
and
grape
musty
the
flavor
is
much
less
provocative
than
the
aroma
and
sall
the
flavors
seem
to
come
together
into
some
sort
of
mixing
the
fingerpaints
together
flavor
where
nothing
distinct
but
alcohol
can
be
tasted
as
it
warms
an
oaky
earthen
flavor
comes
out
in
the
finish
but
something
still
seems
to
be
missing
mouthfeel
is
solid
perfectly
carbonated
and
right
on
medium
bodied
its
smooth
for
the
strength
and
could
match
up
well
with
some
farmy
cheeses
overall
not
my
favorite
dogfish
brew
but
as
always
i
appreciate
its
originality
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
great
flavors
and
aromas
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
was
more
accessible

comkajiisbeerreviews
o
a
nice
beer
that
aging
has
not
hurt
alcohol
is
well
hidden
this
is
easy
to
and
has
good
balance
and
complexity
overall
i
am
usually
not
a
fan
of
a
beer
that
has
wine
like
characteristics
but
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
for
the
most
part
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
the
taste
is
not
for
me
good
flavor
and
aroma
not
sure
if
it
was
completely
true
to
style
but
i
would
try
it
again
and
i
want
to
try
some
more
witbeers
to
compare
a
nuanced
delicate
light
dessert
wine
in
beer
form
this
was
delicious
overall
i
first
had
it
about
2
years
ago
and
was
wowed
today
still
so
because
of
how
unique
it
is
it
is
beer
that
carries
the
properties
of
other
to
create
its
own
identity
salud
o
had
this
at
about
5560
degrees
f
and
for
me
it
was
on
the
nose
such
a
rich
beer
way
better
than
i
expected
but
ive
only
had
two
other
witbiers
dfhs
positive
contact
and
sas
imperial
white
id
place
this
beer
inbetween
the
two
in
terms
of
sweetness
and
body
it
wasnt
as
heavy
and
overthetop
as
the
imperial
white
but
it
was
sweeter
and
richer
than
the
positive
contact
appearance
and
head
retention
are
excellent
and
right
for
a
witbeer
this
bottle
only
aged
for
about
a
month
and
a
half
so
the
fusel
alcohols
were
still
present
in
the
smell
over
shadowing
some
of
the
orange
and
coriander
notes
taste
is
sweet
slighly
cloying
with
fusel
alcohols
also
present
low
frutiness
and
spice
probably
masked
by
the
sweetness
overall
a
good
highalcohol
witbeer
that
should
be
stored
for
a
few
more
months
to
let
the
fusel
alcohols
die
down
o
pretty
tasty
and
a
nice
twist
alcohol
is
a
bit
apparent
but
still
nice
o
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
coriander
and
spice
are
a
little
on
the
strong
side
but
the
integration
of
flavors
here
is
spectacular
and
the
barrel
just
adds
to
the
enjoyment
not
a
traditional
wit
by
any
means
but
a
really
nice
treat
crisp
refreshing
and
with
a
very
wellhidden
abv
the
taste
is
sweet
and
definitely
knocks
you
back
on
your
first
sip
it
definitely
tastes
like
an
imperial
witbier
but
with
an
extra
juicyness
not
found
in
any
witbier
ive
had
i
also
get
a
faint
woody
oak
flavor
in
there
as
well
this
is
a
unique
beer
that
really
took
me
for
surprise
with
how
much
flavor
can
be
packed
into
one
beer
im
not
a
huge
witbier
fan
but
this
still
was
a
big
enough
and
unique
enough
of
a
beer
to
catch
my
attention
to
buy
a
growler
fill
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
not
very
witbier
like
but
i
assume
that
is
the
base
and
the
corriander
washes
it
out
almost
like
an
overpowered
saison
beer
is
too
heavy
it
is
thick
on
the
palate
and
weighs
it
down
the
fruit
gives
it
a
little
bit
of
a
solventy
or
candy
like
flavor
it
is
a
little
too
much
on
all
front
and
wont
be
a
repeat
for
this
guy
unfortunately
love
you
dfh
but
not
this
one
overall
impression
reminds
me
of
a
fruity
weizenbock
interesting
beer
but
a
bit
sweet
and
boozy
for
me
very
much
like
a
carbonated
malty
wine
o
for
the
most
part
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
is
well
hidden
in
this
beer
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
drinkable
while
it
does
taste
too
strong
im
thinking
that
the
high
abv
does
not
make
this
one
for
session
drinking
there
is
a
nice
complexity
to
the
flavor
o
a
nice
little
beer
but
nothing
really
great
d
very
drinkable
nice
big
witbier
with
the
pinot
noir
grapes
and
oak
adding
some
nice
touch
and
balancing
out
the
body
and
the
alcohol
content
overall
not
bad
but
more
complex
than
needed
for
the
style
i
think
the
serving

this

drink
of

i
have
had
this
is
up
there
with
select
company
as
the
best
they
do
overall
pretty
good
very
drinkable
for
its
abv
its
unique
without
being
overly
weird
if
this
really
is
a
strong
interpretation
of
a
belgian
wit
it
certainly
seems
intentional
given
the
addition
of
pinot
and
oak
aging
thinking
of
one
of
sams
books
is
this
supposed
to
be
a
compromise
between
he
said
beer
she
said
wine
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
a
witbier
more
like
a
belgian
strong
golden
ale
with
a
lot
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
and
some
underlying
grape
maybe
it
would
be
better
to
just
make
a
golden
ale
with
pinotone
that
wouldnt
be
overwhelmed
by
the
coriander
and
orange
i
think
it
drinks
like
a
strange
beer
cocktail
o
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
for
sure
not
worth
the
16
dollars
i
paid
but
for
dogfish
head
i
will
pay
it
another
success
from
dfh
for
sure
o
another
interesting
offering
from
dogfish
the
spices
and
wine
notes
are
present
but
neither
are
overpowering
10
and
well
masked
makes
this
is
a
great
appetizer
beer
cheese
worked
well
with
this
split
with
a
friend
o
this
has
aged
well
im
not
one
for
sweeter
beers
but
this
aint
half
bad
i
expected
a
train
wreck
and
was
happily
surprised
when
this
stayed
on
track
the

are
right
in
your
face

a

much
but
overall
its

the

a

on

with

there
is
a
wood
or
tannin
component
probably
from
the
pinot
a
very
different
flavor
and
odd
for
a
witbier
worth
revisiting
for
a
complete
change
88
overall
its
an
interesting
take
on
a
beer
but
im
not
sure
its
pulled
off
well
the
red
wine
doesnt
really
come
through
enough
and
its
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
good
stuff
though
very
dignified
beer
for
a
good
dinner
party
i
think
had
this
beer
at
sapsuckers
in
huntington
new
york
poured
into
a
brandy
snifter
with
a
medium
pure
white
head
and
a
cloudy
golden
color
the
nose
has
aromas
of
golden
raisins
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
thick
creamy
with
a
slight
effervensce
that
clears
the
pallette
for
the
flavors
you
are
about
to
experience
the
beer
has
flavors
of
golden
raisins
champagne
this
beer
is
excellent
with
a
clean
refreshing
feeling
that
went
well
with
the
chilli
with
mac
n
cheese
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
goblet
this
is
last
years
version
bottle
12611
i
can
smell
the
grapes
and
fruit
from
several
feed
away
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
orangish
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
is
of
grapes
oranges
belgian
yeast
esters
funk
coriander
the
fell
is
medium
with
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
good
but
different
first
is
bitterish
overipe
oranges
grapes
and
slight
pino
noirish
taste
alchohol
malts
overall
pretty
good
saw
this
on
tap
and
i
thought
id
revisit
it
since
1
i
hadnt
had
it
in
quite
a
while
and
2
id
yet
to
have
it
on
tap
very
heady
and
it
took
about
5
minutes
to
settle
to
a
servable
pour
tjs
tap
lines
strike
again
murky
orangered
color
the
head
was
tan
ample
and
very
creamy
grape
and
orange
peel
on
the
nose
citric
acid
and
bread
first
sip
was
incredible
actually
maybe
it
was
just
because
of
the
frothiness
of
the
head
but
it
was
incredibly
smooth
and
creamy
almost
like
a
milkshake
with
time
this
died
down
a
bit
and
mellowed
to
the
usual
taste
and
texture
exhibited
by
the
beer
taste
follows
the
nose
pretty
much
bready
yeasty
vinous
orange
peel
wheaty
bite
medium
body
and
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
crisp
and
tasty
and
i
liked
it
slightly
better
on
tap
o
good
stuff
and
im
over
my
wheat
beer
phase
this
one
was
a
real
pleasure
to
have
oanother
interesting
wine
beer
from
dfh
about
the
same
as
noble
rot
overall
each
are
worth
a
try
but
not
something
id
seek
out
again
for
the
money
doa
o
ive
seen
this
one
in
the
store
but
had
never
taken
the
plunge
until
now
i
dug
this
and
wouldnt
mind
having
a
bottle
floating
around
in
my
cellar
o
im
a
wine
specialist
by
occupation
and
i
can
detect
very
little
if
the
pinot
in
this
hence
the
disappointment
the
color
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
but
if
the
pinot
or
oak
made
more
of
an
impact
it
wouldnt
matter
wont
necessarily
seek
this
out
again
but
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
was
offered
meh
bottled
on
012611
printed
on
bottle
poured
from
22oz
bomber
into
a
tulip
a
slightly
hazy
amber
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
this
fades
quickly
to
leave
moderate
lacing
and
a
heavy
ring
s
sweet
malts
and
spice
dominate
over
citrus
and
oak
notes
t
heavy
on
the
sweet
malts
with
a
mildly
bitter
middle
and
some
citrus
on
the
finish
more
pinot
on
the
taste
than
the
smell
definite
oakiness
to
the
taste
as
well
syrupy
mouthfeel
with
little
carbonation
a
complex
smelling
and
tasting
beer
which
is
unlike
most
beers
out
there
very
unique
not
my
favorite
from
them
but
i
appreciate
the
uniqueness
of
their
beers
at
the
very
least
i
need
to
have
another
one
of
these
red
and
whites
with
company
i
think
if
matt
and
i
were
both
sampling
we
could
help
each
other
figure
out
whats
going
on
here
thanks
to
slvrmon82
for
the
bottle
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
barely
comparable
to
the
classic
witbier
style
this
brew
conceals
its
alcohol
well
while
presenting
strong
honey
notes
and
subtle
red
wine
notes
moderate
to
light
carbonation
with
a
sweet
and
slightly
cloying
finish
wont
seek
out
but
would
drink
again
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
pleasurably
mild
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
very
different
and
enjoyable
beer
there
are
a
number
of
flavors
coming
together
you
do
not
often
find
in
combination
in
many
beers
the
flavors
mesh
very
well
a
great
bottle
to
share
i
am
not
certain
an
entire
bottle
would
be
something
i
enjoy
o
a
very
good
wit
bier
very
smooth
and
you
dont
taste
the
abv
t
a
bit
of
a
heavy
wit
flavor
upfront
followed
by
a
pretty
big
grape
flavor
faint
wheat
and
a
slight
bit
of
hop
resin
white
pepper
yeast
some
heavy
malt
flavors
and
a
touch
of
bread
on
the
finish
a
little
too
heavy
for
me
but
its
not
a
bad
experiment
my
overall
thoughts
are
this
is
a
good
winter
beer
it
is
spicy
and
hot
almost
a
wheat
wine
but
nicely
carbonated
with
a
well
thought
out
balance
between
the
spice
and
the
malts
overall
love
the
complexity
of
this
brew
the
wine
fruit
hop
taste
goes
great
together
good
balance
and
nice
and
smooth
on
the
palate
cheers
meh
interesting
interpretation
of
the
style
but
not
entirely
recommended
o
great
beer
would
seek
it
out
again
a
plus
is
that
my
wife
loved
it
o
not
bad
i
didnt
really
have
any
expectations
going
into
this
but
it
was
an
interesting
brew
and
im
glad
i
tried
it

i
certainly
enjoyed
this
nice
mixture
of

and
wine
flavours
that
seem
to
work
well
with
each
other
overall
i
enjoyed
drinking
this
beer
cant
see
myself
forking
out
10
bucks
on
it
again
soon
but
if
i
see
it
on
tap
i
will
most
likely
try
it
again
a
nice
idea
but
a
little
winey
and
the
flavor
profile
is
not
what
i
was
hoping
for
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
that
feels
creamy
throughout
but
finishes
slightly
dry
taste
is
very
much
like
it
smells
with
orange
rind
being
the
feature
taste
and
a
white
wine
like
taste
behind
it
a
warming
alcohol
oversees
all
of
it
and
adds
to
the
wine
qualities
that
this
beer
shows
coriander
is
heavy
in
the
aftertaste
almost
throwing
the
beer
a
little
out
of
whack
as
far
as
balance
goes
its
not
always
that
i
find
the
description
on
the
bottle
matches
exactly
the
way
it
actually
tastes
and
even
rarer
that
i
can
pick
out
each
facet
of
the
beer
and
identify
the
ingredients
but
pinot
noir
orange
peel
and
coriander
are
all
easily
identifiable
but
each
holds
its
own
as
a
huge
part
of
the
overall
experience
i
can
see
wine
lovers
getting
into
this
beer
as
a
transitional
beer
but
beer
lovers
can
appreciate
the
fruitiness
and
feel
of
this
one
i
like
it
and
am
always
happy
to
try
something
new
from
dfh
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
orange
red
color
with
a
white
fizzy
looking
head
on
top
the
head
fades
quickly
and
doesnt
lace
the
glass
too
much
the
smell
of
this
beer
gives
off
a
slightly
sour
aroma
with
a
subtle
sweetness
as
well
the
taste
of
fermented
grape
give
this
beer
a
big
wine
like
profile
the
flavors
are
a
little
on
the
tart
side
and
leaves
you
with
a
dry
fruity
aftertaste
there
is
also
a
good
amount
of
yeasty
flavors
going
on
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
its
moderately
carbonated
and
maintains
a
good
drinkability
overall
its
not
my
favorite
dfh
brew
but
im
happy
to
have
tried
it
o
goes
down
ok
not
overly
tasty
somewhat
filling
big
kick
not
a
very
good
representation
of
the
style
this
is
a
one
and
done
beer
for
me
overall
this
is
decent
i
think
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
abv
was
knocked
down
a
few
percentage
points
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
black
blue
overall
i
think
this
a
marvelous
brew
as
it
does
marry
perfectly
the
best
of
wine
and
beer
i
admit
that
i
could
see
how
the
wineheavy
aftertaste
would
prove
a
hindrance
to
some
but
i
think
the
combination
is
superb
as
with
other
dfh
offerings
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
sample
this
brew
puts
all
of
its
cards
on
the
table
and
much
more
importantly
it
truly
delivers
the
taste
followed
the
same
route
with
the
huge
candy
sweetness
predominating
some
other
hints
of
apple
cherries
grapes
some
alcohol
but
it
is
mostly
balanced
by
the
rebost
flavors
goes
down
very
smooth
light
and
crisp
tingles
and
warms
as
it
goes
carbonation
is
not
overally
done
though
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
brew
a
little
too
sweet
to
have
more
then
one
or
two
but
is
perfect
as
a
sipper
after
dinner
the
wine
notes
are
subtle
and
the
style
i
am
not
sure
where
they
got
that
from
a
sweet
citrusy
and
floral
ale
this
works
overall
grade
cb
its
a
little
weird
but
i
enjoy
it
feel
is
at
about
medium
and
totally
defies
the
style
guidelines
a
bit
syrupy
yet
not
overkill
a
semi
tartness
on
the
end
carbed
up
nice
yet
goes
down
smoother
for
a
strange
reason
i
cant
pinpoint
i
enjoyed
this
one
a
10
witbier
naw
this
is
a
10
i
dont
know
o
overall
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
well
balanced
beer
and
does
not
become
regulated
by
style
great
level
of
intensity
just
a
bit
too
much
on
the
body
and
texture
to
become
one
with
the
other
ingredients
another
off
centered
ale
that
works
out
very
well
oi
love
pinot
noir
and
i
love
beer
but
the
2
tastes
together
were
like
a
science
experiment
gone
awry
i
am
a
huge
dfh
fan
and
give
them
credit
for
taking
more
chances
than
most
breweries
but
i
can
not
endorse
this
one
sorry
sam
i
had
3
bombers
of
this
with
me
on
a
trip
to
the
finger
lakes
in
n
y
since
it
was
a
fishing
trip
this
wasnt
necessarily
consume
in
the
traditional
format
i
drank
this
right
from
the
bottle
but
managed
to
save
some
of
the
third
bottle
for
a
serving
out
of
a
glass
this
is
a
very
effervescent
beer
the
fruityness
isnt
overwhelming
like
the
black
blue
the
orange
and
coriander
are
both
noticeable
and
a
wonderful
compliment
to
the
raspberry
not
so
sure
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
but
it
quite
enjoyable
o
good
but
not
great
this
is
the
second
pinot
noirinspired
beer
i
have
tried
after
russian
rivers
supplication
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
the
supplication
alot
more
even
though
i
found
it
a
little
bit
overthetop
if
a
brewer
could
come
up
with
a
winebeer
fusion
somewhere
between
the
intensity
of
this
and
supplication
it
might
be
perfect
in
my
opinion
with
all
that
being
said
it
is
really
hard
to
think
of
this
as
a
witbier
when
you
drink
it
just
enjoy
it
for
what
it
is
its
own
creation
o
overall
not
a
bad
brew
could
do
with
less
spice
character
as
it
seems
out
of
place
in
this
beer
i
would
try
this
again
not
as
tannic
as
expected
for
a
beer
that
was
aged
in
oak
pours
amber
with
a
decent
amount
of
head
smell
is
pretty
much
as
advertised
grapes
wine
nice
amount
of
coriander
and
some
presence
of
orange
peel
also
some
alcohol
present
in
the
smell
taste
is
slight
tartness
up
front
followed
immediately
by
an
intense
sweetness
wine
characteristics
tart
dry
fruit
some
tannins
come
through
once
the
sweetness
subsides
some
subtle
bitterness
on
the
finish
interesting
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
come
together
and
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overpowering
im
glad
i
tried
this
but
i
probably
wouldnt
have
it
again
o
good
flavors
are
a
bit
intruded
on
by
intensely
wet
alcohols
this
beer
absorbed
a
lot
of
wine
characteristics
from
the
barrels
but
comes
off
a
bit
too
acidic
id
like
to
think
this
might
mellow
in
time
but
the
alcohol
feel
is
intensified
by
the
acidity
of
the
wood
its
too
bad
like
a
serving
method
intruding
too
much
on
food
mellow
flavor
balanced
with
solid
alcohols
like
nice
red
wines
but
this
thing
needs
time
to
be
the
champ
its
meant
to
be
this
definitely
crosses
the
bridge
between
wine
and
beer
o
a
nice
and
quite
different
witbier
i
think
this
will
especially
appeal
to
those
that
also
enjoy
a
good
glass
of
wine
while
it
makes
sense
with
the
abv
i
think
that
this
lacked
the
lightness
of
body
and
flavor
that
makes
witbier
such
a
refreshing
and
complex
style
its
its
own
drink
but
not
sure
if
its
a
move
forward
in
the
style
or
just
a
move
sideways
overall
impression
doverall
i
was
hoping
for
alittle
more
i
didnt
feel
the
flavors
balanced
as
well
as
i
would
of
liked
and
would
of
liked
alittle
more
complexity
from
this
beer
d
this
was
a
nice
blend
of
mellow
wit
with
tannic
pinot
noir
i
liked
the
sweet
and
tart
scent
and
taste
and
the
body
was
solid
too
alcohol
was
hidden
quite
well
so
it
was
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
good
beer
fresh
but
it
could
possibly
improve
with
some
age
recommended
o
i
love
this
beer
dfh
always
gets
extra
points
for
their
creativity
and
this
is
no
exception
they
arent
afraid
to
experiment
and
these
kinds
of
beers
are
what
is
going
to
introduce
the
craft
beer
movement
to
new
patrons
and
keep
it
alive
this
is
a
witbier
but
im
reviewing
it
more
like
a
dfh
red
and
white
rather
than
a
witbier
i
was
so
impressed
by
this
and
each
facet
was
great
overall
i
went
in
expecting
more
by
viewing
biased
reaction
from
friends
drinking
the
same
around
me
would
have
much
rather
drank
without
preconceived
thoughts
not
my
favorite
from
dogfish
head
but
still
a
good
beer
i
would
return
to
drink
on
a
mild
fall
day
o
overall
this
is
a
nice
aged
offering
from
dog
fish
head
glad
i
cracked
it
when
i
did
o
not
as
good
as
some
wine
beers
ive
had
but
its
an
over
all
top
10
wine
beers
for
me
drinkability
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
especially
after
the
smell
its
really
earthy
and
sort
of
belgiumy
and
yeasty
id
really
like
to
try
a
fresh
bottle
and
see
how
its
changed
over
the
last
4
years
thanks
much
jeffypoo
o
i
cant
hope
but
want
more
of
the
witbier
to
come
out
from
this
and
less
of
the
grape
might
be
better
if
it
was
extremely
fresh
o
tasty
not
worth
aging
twice
overall
its
definitely
interesting
being
a
wit
ages
in
pinot
noir
barrels
with
pinot
juice
it
has
an
awesome
super
cool
color
although
because
its
a
wit
i
dont
think
it
has
the
sweetness
and
body
to
stand
up
to
the
bitterness
from
the
pinot
i
do
think
its
interesting
and
different
as
we
all
know
dfh
is
and
i
still
do
enjoy
drinking
it
pours
burnt
orange
small
head
that
lasted
the
entire
glass
smells
of
oak
and
orange
and
other
citrus
that
i
cant
place
starts
out
tasting
like
a
typical
wit
beer
or
even
a
hefe
but
the
pinot
noir
and
some
oak
comes
out
through
the
finish
and
makes
it
very
nice
alcohol
is
very
noticeable
im
not
huge
on
wit
biers
but
id
like
to
get
this
again
if
my
state
still
carried
it
ahhem
dogfish
head
please
come
back
to
us
the
finish
is
where
the
wine
like
traits
show
for
me
it
is
very
crisp
and
very
smooth
the
carbonation
is
at
the
beginning
but
almost
nonexistent
by
the
end
of
the
drink
this
was
very
drinkable
and
i
really
enjoyed
it
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
dogfish
i
guess
what
i
didnt
like
is
it
tasted
too
much
like
a
wine
for
me
and
the
alcohol
taste
was
too
sharp
i
had
heard
that
this
beer
looked
impressive
though
and
it
did
have
a
neat
reddish
look
to
it
the
reddish
hue
of
this
beer
is
amazing
and
the
taste
from
the
barrel
aging
and
pinot
noir
are
very
upfront
and
wonderfully
done
im
not
usually
a
witbier
fan
but
this
isnt
your
normal
witbier
from
your
not
normal
brewery
o
another
winner
from
dfh
solid
wit
refreshing
with
a
good
kick
pinot
noir
juice
and
the
oranges
really
pair
will
with
each
other
and
the
spices
wish
tge
oak
was
more
dominant
p
would
pair
well
with
herb
roasted
poultry
pork
sausages
sweet
bbq
pulled
pork
and
a
range
of
tomatobased
pasta
dishes
from
marinara
to
puttanesca
a
must
seek
out
if
you
like
dogfish
products
o
delicious
4
5
great
unique
beer
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
o
there
is
good
drinkability
here
it
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
especially
considering
the
alcohol
content
it
is
definitely
a
unique
interpretation
of
the
style
and
i
found
it
to
be
very
enjoyable
i
would
pick
this
one
up
again
overall
very
good
this
was
my
olive
branch
to
the
east
coast
specifically
dogfish
head
i
have
had
bad
experiences
with
the
6090120
i
am
willing
to
accept
the
fact
that
we
are
west
coast
and
its
possible
what
i
tasted
is
old
this
is
very
good
and
opens
my
horizons
to
more
dfh
well
played
o
pretty
good
stuff
but
i
cant
help
but
feel
that
this
brew
underacheives
o
a
wine
lovers
beer
choice
it
has
a
very
complex
flavor
i
dont
consider
it
d
quite
easy
to
drink
o
not
bad
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
flavors
were
a
little
lacking
for
me
a
little
too
sweet
as
well
especially
with
the
price
it
was
nice
to
try
but
probably
not
one
ill
go
running
back
for
overall
thanks
to
inlimbo77
for
giving
me
a
chance
to
try
this
one
i
am
not
as
impressed
as
i
thought
i
would
be
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
more
tart
it
was
decent
though
o
overall
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
one
one
of
the
best
750ml
bottles
from
dfh
highly
recommend
a
big
old
750ml
bottle
and
its
going
to
take
some
time
to
finish
it
and
a
tough
decision
on
the
scoring
o
i
really
like
this
one
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
is
one
of
dfh
bestselling
limited
editions
it
is
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
if
only
it
wasnt
13
a
bottle
but
that
said
if
i
see
it
again
in
the
store
ill
buy
it
again
its
a
nice
treat
beer
the
sweetness
puts
a
big
dent
of
drinkability
for
me
a
complex
brew
but
just
a
little
too
rich
o
a
delicious
beer
the
10
abv
is
extremely
well
masked
making
this
one
dangerous
brew
definitely
would
like
to
have
this
one
again
in
the
future
pours
nice
honey
orange
with
3
fingers
of
white
head
shades
of
pink
show
through
the
head
as
well
smell
is
ok
with
some
belgian
yeast
and
sprarkling
grape
jjuice
pushing
through
good
mouth
feel
but
finishes
a
littly
syrupy
taste
is
zesty
and
reminiscent
of
sparkling
rose
wine
glad
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
back
o
a
great
overall
beer
with
that
i
was
surprised
the
addition
of
pinot
noir
is
very
welcome
in
the
style
in
my
opinion
almost
adding
a
woody
sweetness
unlike
any
other
o
a
very
crisp
refreshing
delicious
beer
loved
the
unfiltered
chunks
i
never
would
have
known
that
it
was
10
abv
until
the
final
couple
of
sips
i
cant
wait
to
buy
another
d
well
this
is
definitely
not
my
favorite
dfh
offering
but
that
doesnt
mean
its
not
good
they
really
nailed
what
the
were
going
for
a
wine
type
of
beer
if
that
makes
sense
lots
of
grape
flavors
up
front
with
some
nicely
added
spices
my
fiance
loves
this
and
she
is
a
wineo
so
if
you
like
wine
this
is
the
beer
for
you
overall
i
like
black
and
blue
better
than
this
but
its
not
bad
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
people
who
dont
typically
like
beer
and
it
would
pair
well
with
some
desserts
o
this
has
a
lot
of
character
for
a
beer
and
is
quite
complex
its
fairly
easy
to
drink
yet
it
exhibits
the
necessary
maltiness
and
strong
body
flavor
served
from
tap
into
a
sampler
tumbler
poured
a
slightly
hazy
redorange
with
a
minimal
white
head
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
banana
citrus
and
sweet
alcohol
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
banana
citrus
citrus
hop
cream
and
sweet
alcohol
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
but
not
really
my
style
the
alcohol
aspect
was
definitely
present
like
crazy
on
this
one
the
flavor
was
a
little
bit
better
than
the
aroma
gave
off
but
thats
not
saying
too
much
worth
introducing
to
your
palate
at
least
once
but
that
is
about
it
o
delicious
twist
on
witbier
with
a
very
wellhidden
abv
pairs
excellently
with
italian
antipasto
of
olives
prosciutto
and
wheat
bread
another
amazing
brew
from
dogfish
overall
i
would
say
a
seasoned
wine
drinker
would
think
twice
about
choosing
a
wine
over
red
and
white
not
what
i
was
expecting
i
like
it
a
lot
good
experimental
beer
from
dfh
its
definitely
got
some
sweetness
and
you
definitely
taste
the
grapes
but
its
balanced
well
by
some
mild
hop
very
enjoyable
pours
a
beautiful
light
ruby
tinged
with
purple
with
bubbles
abound
and
a
strong
2
head
that
formed
into
beautiful
lacing
smelled
of
grapes
and
a
faint
hop
scent
and
just
catching
the
orange
peel
and
spice
in
the
back
taste
was
so
crisp
and
grapey
mild
citrus
hops
and
a
delicious
yeast
with
faint
corriander
barely
detectable
probably
the
closest
thing
to
wine
i
will
drink
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
bubbly
and
light
overall
a
very
pleasant
surprise
from
dogfish
head
hell
yes
to
this
big
burley
witbier
o
fascinating
worth
trying
once
but
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
my
palate
not
a
must
try
im
glad
i
shared
this
one
with
my
brotherinlaw
could
barely
drink
12
of
it
d
3
5
im
a
little
disappointed
with
this
dfh
offering
i
know
that
their
brews
are
offcentered
and
usually
thats
great
however
the
beerwine
hybrid
that
is
red
white
just
doesnt
work
for
me
that
well
i
appreciate
it
for
what
it
is
the
flavors
are
extracted
well
from
its
ingredients
it
has
a
great
appearance
and
feel
i
just
wish
i
enjoyed
its
flavor
more
im
a
big
fan
of
dfh
but
this
one
does
not
achieve
any
worthy
status
for
me
but
i
do
appreciate
the
effort
dfh
is
as
dfh
head
does
theyre
great
for
the
same
reason
theyre
not
so
great
they
take
chances
with
exotic
ingredients
and
processes
sometimes
its
good
sometimes
its
bad
but
usually
its
pretty
average
with
a
high
price
tag
red
white
is
a
combination
of
the
latter
two
o
interesting
but
i
would
not
nor
want
to
try
this
on
a
regular
basis
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
beer
is
a
deepgoldenamber
color
with
a
slight
whit
head
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
nice
malt
initially
greets
the
nose
pale
malt
with
a
little
lightly
toasted
notes
next
comes
a
hint
of
berries
wood
a
hint
of
sour
and
some
wild
notes
the
beer
is
very
sweet
its
a
luxurious
sweetness
malt
centered
with
a
lot
of
fruit
notes
firm
bitterness
the
spice
comes
out
more
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
soft
and
smooth
tongue
blanketing
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
beer
conclusion
very
drinkable
with
its
light
body
very
enjoyable
light
crisp
and
clean
one
that
is
best
served
cold
in
my
opinion
i
would
like
to
find
this
on
tap
i
have
to
give
it
to
them
for
this
um
witbeer
really
its
really
unconventical
and
a
new
way
of
looking
at
the
style
but
its
a
bit
living
large
for
me
and
elixer
of
sorts
and
that
can
be
a
bit
heavy
handed
pour
is
reddish
pink
with
an
off
pink
head
nose
was
orange
the
added
kind
on
the
hop
generated
kind
sweet
and
slow
sipping
warm
at
the
face
but
not
on
the
palate
smooth
as
a
caddy
some
pollen
florel
but
subtle
in
the
face
of
the
added
spice
d
very
drinkable
with
its
light
body
and
no
trace
of
the
high
gravity
in
sight
the
odd
aroma
and
flavor
i
suppose
are
from
the
pinot
noir
its
a
good
beer
but
not
great
drinkability
not
what
i
expected
for
a
witbier
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
i
thought
there
was
just
enough
wine
flavoring
to
make
it
interesting
but
it
didnt
overpower
the
beer
taste
a
great
wine
substitute
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
pours
a
hazy
dark
amber
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
some
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
and
boozey
orange
peel
lemon
and
grapes
this
beer
does
have
some
qualities
you
expect
in
a
wit
along
with
more
fruit
flavors
more
grapes
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
along
with
some
orange
peel
boozey
aftertaste
definitely
reminds
me
of
wine
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
and
worth
grabbing
but
i
would
think
a
bomber
may
be
too
much
in
my
personal
opinion
this
beer
just
has
too
much
going
on
corriander
port
juice
orange
peel
oak
staves
wheat
beer
this
beer
is
all
over
the
place
so
there
isnt
anything
that
really
shines
thru
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
heavier
side
for
the
style
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
was
pretty
good
it
was
a
pretty
cool
beer
overall
i
liked
the
grape
fruity
flavors
it
had
and
they
mixed
with
the
wit
beer
flavors
pretty
well
a
pretty
nice
beer
overall
and
one
of
the
better
dogfish
750s
ive
had
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
ill
have
on
tap
again
if
i
see
it
but
i
probably
wont
get
a
750
ml
bottle
rather
drinkable
the
flavor
palate
changes
just
enough
to
be
interesting
and
the
balance
is
there
though
sectioned
in
parts
alcohol
is
detectable
but
not
overwhelming
the
idea
was
brilliant
a
imperial
wit
beer
and
red
grape
marriage
aged
in
oak
done
belgian
style
the
marriage
could
have
been
better
but
applause
on
the
creativity
drinkability
is
downgraded
because
of
the
10
abv
higher
than
average
abv
seems
to
be
a
dfh
hallmark
nevertheless
this
beer
is
very
enjoyable
you
wont
go
wrong
enjoying
this
one
drink
is
yet
once
again
especially
dogfishheadish
terrific
d
this
is
an
intersting
brew
not
sure
it
is
one
id
want
to
drink
on
aonsistent
basis
but
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
drinkability
fun
rich
and
spicey
beer
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
but
am
finding
out
the
alcohol
does
not
mess
around
another
please
this
beer
is
all
over
the
map
not
worth
another
try
overall
probably
one
of
the
most
unique
craft
beers
i
have
tasted
since
i
started
down
this
path
i
dont
know
if
this
qualifies
as
an
extreme
beer
but
it
is
definitely
different
and
i
like
it
this
years
tastes
like
its
had
some
age
on
it
almost
a
bit
anomalous
ill
do
a
side
by
side
with
last
years
and
see
what
shakes
outta
the
bushes
overall
i
expected
more
from
this
one
it
wasnt
quite
what
i
wanted
it
to
be
good
none
the
less
and
worth
trying
but
i
cant
wait
for
black
and
blue
to
come
out
again
mouthfeel
is
better
than
average
for
the
style
d
quite
tasty
but
strong
wine
flavor
and
warming
alcohol
would
and
should
slow
you
down
a
crazy
good
experimental
witbier
d
i
planned
on
sharing
this
yet
i
was
so
smitten
with
this
beer
i
kept
all
of
it
to
myself
for
the
evening
d
i
really
liked
this
beer
sweet
but
not
over
powering
and
it
has
a
serious
about
of
alcohol
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
1
or
2
considering
the
abv
but
it
is
definitely
a
beer
you
should
try
overall
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
because
of
the
price
i
paid
11
99
i
would
not
drink
it
often
however
its
the
type
of
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
quiet
evening
or
share
with
a
friend
another
quality
brew
from
dfh
d
great
great
great
beer
i
could
see
myself
sipping
many
of
these
on
early
spring
evenings
and
late
summer
days
overall
this
is
an
okay
beer
i
appreciate
dfh
innovation
and
this
is
definitely
an
interesting
concept
the
flavors
just
dont
mix
in
an
overly
appealing
manner
that
would
make
this
a
beer
that
i
would
go
back
to
very
often
i
drank
this
from
a
750
ml
bottle
the
10
abv
is
masked
very
well
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
color
is
an
orangeamber
with
a
solid
head
the
initial
mouthfeel
is
fantastic
it
is
a
classic
dogfish
creation
it
is
almost
like
a
blend
of
hoegaarden
and
a
fancy
red
wine
you
get
a
slight
of
the
wine
taste
and
the
end
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
dogfish
brews
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
i
am
glad
that
i
tried
it
that
said
i
wont
be
drinking
this
all
the
time
or
anything
because
it
is
bold
in
ways
that
i
dont
think
that
i
would
appreciate
more
than
once
in
a
while
id
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
but
you
may
want
to
share
a
bottle
with
a
buddy
or
two
d
when
i
ordered
i
did
not
realize
this
was
10
but
the
alcohol
is
masked
very
well
nice
flavors
with
the
pinot
standing
out
more
than
the
oak
just
watch
the
price
tag
and
the
abv
pours
a
hazy
reddish
color
almost
like
a
fizzy
wine
with
a
slightly
off
white
one
finger
head
and
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
pungent
of
grapes
cherries
oranges
and
lemons
like
a
fruit
salad
the
taste
is
of
some
lemon
and
orange
but
a
majority
of
white
grapes
cherries
and
red
grapes
there
is
a
wine
like
feel
to
the
flavor
at
the
back
end
i
feel
the
grapes
are
very
present
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbonated
and
slightly
stingy
the
drinkability
is
very
high
this
was
a
weekend
staple
on
our
visit
a
very
easy
smooth
drink
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
you
can
easily
have
multiples
of
this
cheers
nice
imperial
wit
with
lots
of
different
an
unusual
flavors
for
the
style
but
i
think
it
is
a
bit
too
much
as
witbiers
should
be
more
simple
and
straightforward
red
white
pours
a
light
red
sherry
in
color
with
a
nice
sizzling
off
white
head
and
some
lace
in
the
smell
shiraz
type
notes
and
juicy
grape
winesque
for
the
most
part
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
coriander
rounding
it
out
like
blending
a
fruity
white
wine
with
a
witbier
almost
alcohol
presence
is
noticed
a
pretty
interesting
beer
and
well
worth
the
try
cheers
d
a
pretty
easy
drinker
even
at
10
id
recommend
sharing
some
with
friends
who
are
into
wine
and
see
what
they
have
to
say
about
it
and
how
beer
culture
is
on
the
rise
the
taste
is
light
and
citrus
with
some
sweet
coming
in
at
the
end
this
feels
kind
of
thick
but
light
at
the
same
time
it
has
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
and
is
highly
drinkable
its
a
little
pricey
but
probably
worth
it
overall
i
like
this
beer
and
would
get
it
again
overall
a
decent
beer
but
not
super
exciting
i
feel
like
it
could
be
tweaked
a
bit
in
a
different
way
to
make
it
awesome
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
bitter
acidic
and
big
berry
fruitiness
blasting
along
the
palate
were
in
the
middle
of
a
deep
freeze
watching
bad
movies
and
waiting
for
the
rolling
black
outs
to
kick
back
in
while
the
wife
drinks
a
malbec
to
warm
the
insides
im
drinking
dog
fishs
red
white
sitting
in
my
challis
in
front
of
a
lamp
it
has
a
deep
orange
hue
and
a
thick
unfiltered
body
that
actually
resembles
the
rind
of
an
orange
the
smell
is
beautifully
aromatic
of
orange
with
a
hint
of
the
pinot
and
the
taste
is
subtle
in
both
of
those
directions
the
texture
is
soft
on
the
pallet
while
the
aftertaste
is
very
short
lived
but
enjoyable
since
its
10
abv
ive
got
a
nice
buzz
going
while
this
horrible
movie
comes
to
an
anticlimactic
finish
all
in
all
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
wouldnt
want
to
stock
too
much
of
it
in
the
fridge
or
cellar
if
i
had
one
had
this
on
tap
at
pony
bar
in
new
york
city
pours
a
hazy
orange
colour
with
thin
white
head
minimal
lacing
smells
quite
spicy
i
dont
know
if
i
originally
picked
up
the
wine
but
upon
knowing
it
was
there
i
could
smell
it
sweet
belgian
yeasty
flavour
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
i
really
didnt
realize
this
was
10
alcohol
hides
it
nicely
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
snifter
glass
at
dfh
pours
hazy
red
with
a
small
offwhite
head
fruity
aroma
with
a
lot
of
grape
a
bit
of
coriander
and
other
vague
herbal
notes
medium
bodied
flavours
of
fruit
and
cream
with
hints
of
wood
and
wine
and
a
mildly
herbal
finish
didnt
wow
me
but
still
quite
tasty
i
thought
this
brew
had
an
incredibly
beautiful
color
and
a
nice
light
head
the
smell
was
fantastic
very
complex
the
wheat
was
obvious
in
both
aroma
and
taste
with
the
first
sip
i
was
quite
surprised
at
how
much
the
pinot
noir
took
over
in
the
flavor
i
was
quite
pleased
and
would
recommend
this
to
any
adventurous
drinker
this
beer
pours
directly
in
between
ruby
red
and
auburn
it
has
a
light
off
white
head
that
rims
the
glass
despite
being
a
2010
it
still
has
a
good
amount
of
floating
sediment
it
smells
of
fermented
fruit
it
kind
of
smells
like
a
sangria
yet
with
a
wheat
base
i
guess
what
im
trying
to
say
is
its
in
between
a
sweet
lambic
and
a
wheat
it
smells
great
it
tastes
great
as
well
it
tastes
of
sweet
dark
fruits
its
kind
of
like
orange
and
pomegranate
this
beer
is
quality
through
and
through
it
drinks
exceptionally
smooth
like
all
dfh
750s
this
is
a
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
i
highly
recommend
it
but
it
can
get
a
little
sweet
at
times
very
interesting
brew
i
like
it
alot
wine
enthusiasts
would
appreciate
this
one
of
course
beer
lovers
as
well
very
unique
just
what
i
would
expect
from
dogfish
head
great
brew
definitely
recommended
d
it
is
refreshing
and
delicious
typically
orange
and
coriander
are
followed
by
palatenumbing
hoppy
bitterness
but
not
so
with
this
beer
d
its
ok
might
be
a
hit
with
wine
lovers
looking
for
something
to
kick
their
ass
hardly
any
balance
and
the
flavors
seems
to
all
be
competing
with
each
other
and
the
alcohol
watching
the
head
develop
was
very
interesting
head
of
two
fingers
atop
a
orangish
brown
brew
good
clinging
lace
nice
pattern
color
is
a
20
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
very
complex
orange
cranberry
grape
lemon
currant
apple
each
time
i
smell
it
there
is
something
new
taste
there
is
the
malt
grapes
apple
oranges
lime
pine
molasses
lots
of
body
fullness
smooth
and
carbonated
other
than
being
maybe
a
little
sweet
for
my
palate
this
is
a
great
beer
one
is
about
all
i
would
want
at
a
setting
seeing
it
comes
in
a
1
pint
9
6
fluid
oz
25
6
fluid
ounces
and
at
10
abv
a
little
bit
bigger
than
the
traditional
bomber
and
it
will
get
you
bombed
especially
on
an
empty
stomach
do
drinkability
is
low
i
feel
glad
i
split
this
with
a
few
people
as
there
is
no
way
i
would
have
had
been
able
to
drink
it
all
myself
very
unique
d
i
can
see
this
as
more
of
a
food
pairing
kind
of
beer
drinkable
yes
d
this
is
an
interesting
wellmade
beer
but
its
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
offering
and
i
am
usually
a
big
fan
i
like
the
grape
and
wine
notes
but
for
me
the
orange
and
coriander
are
too
upfront
without
the
malt
to
balance
them
out
overall
very
unbeerlike
more
like
a
beer
mimosa
with
orange
juice
dfh
makes
some
crazy
stuff
and
its
another
one
off
the
roster
that
i
decided
to
try
and
it
was
worth
the
drink
different
not
ground
breaking
but
worth
it
d
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
i
dont
get
that
it
is
a
witbier
however
reminds
me
of
a
complex
fruit
beer
instead
whatever
the
case
may
be
it
is
certainly
unique
and
worth
trying
at
least
once
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
and
all
beer
lovers
i
had
no
idea
what
this
beer
was
all
about
until
a
friend
told
me
to
go
out
and
try
it
i
trusted
his
judgment
hopefully
you
will
take
my
advice
and
try
this
surprisingly
complex
brew
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
d
no
alcohol
presence
in
the
least
this
like
most
other
dfh
brews
is
awesome
in
drinkability
flavorful
and
potent
a
little
too
syruplike
in
regards
to
the
pinot
but
good
d
treat
similar
to
wine
and
you
have
the
right
idea
on
how
rich
this
beer
is
d
i
shared
this
bottle
and
had
a
hard
time
finishing
my
half
of
it
let
me
start
by
saying
you
better
like
pinot
noir
alcohol
if
youre
going
to
enjoy
this
one
awesome
pour
dirty
orange
red
color
with
3
finger
white
head
the
pinot
noir
is
heavy
in
the
taste
mouth
feel
is
refreshing
and
light
with
great
tones
of
orange
sugar
coriander
and
fruits
another
unique
and
complex
brew
from
dogfish
head
very
complex
flavors
its
a
cross
between
a
wit
and
a
pinot
lots
of
sweet
and
acidic
fruits
and
the
carbonation
helps
out
with
sweetness
the
oak
didnt
show
up
in
the
flavor
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
and
im
glad
any
more
oak
and
it
would
have
overwhelmed
the
rest
of
the
flavors
one
of
the
most
complex
beers
ive
ever
had
this
beer
will
not
bore
you
by
any
means
d
glad
i
tried
it
but
probably
wont
revisit
unless
on
tap
too
weird
of
a
brew
for
me
i
cant
really
figure
out
what
theyre
going
for
with
this
one
really
honest
red
wine
flavor
here
an
interesting
hybrid
but
definitely
only
grab
this
if
youre
looking
for
something
more
experimental
pours
a
light
reddish
color
with
a
white
head
the
nose
is
dominated
by
red
wine
with
a
tad
bit
of
light
red
fruit
and
some
citrus
the
taste
is
pretty
much
light
red
wine
almost
just
tasting
like
it
has
been
watered
down
and
carbonated
feel
is
a
bit
sweet
drinks
well
enough
but
i
just
didnt
get
much
from
this
d
a
little
sweet
for
my
taste
but
definitively
unique
and
interesting
glad
that
i
shared
the
bomber
d
pretty
well
balanced
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
for
my
personal
taste
but
delectable
all
the
same
dogfish
head
never
disappoints
but
they
have
better
beers
d
definitely
deserves
a
special
occasion
great
beer
needs
to
be
drank
slowly
and
im
okay
with
that
mediumplus
bodied
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
goes
down
easy
enough
but
in
my
opinion
its
uniqueness
wears
on
you
not
something
youd
want
a
lot
of
in
a
sitting
that
said
id
welcome
a
revist
as
some
future
point
drink
far
from
the
delicate
wit
i
thought
it
would
be
red
white
is
a
hefty
brew
that
begs
to
be
shared
with
others
enjoyable
but
hard
to
finish
on
your
own
overall
id
say
drinkability
is
okay
but
clearly
one
pint
is
gonna
do
it
always
cool
to
try
one
of
the
offcentered
ale
dogfish
head
brew
up
taste
the
orange
is
the
first
thing
i
noticed
typical
witbier
flavors
alcohol
is
there
but
its
not
too
bad
right
now
drinkability
being
11
this
is
a
little
too
easy
drinking
you
can
smell
and
taste
that
is
it
a
little
higher
than
alcohol
but
you
wouldnt
guess
that
it
was
this
high
initially
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
but
fatugue
and
the
10
abv
set
in
and
made
this
a
more
difficult
finish
a
hearty
brew
one
to
share
not
take
on
yourself
this
beer
pours
a
pinkish
red
color
with
a
medium
white
head
leaving
some
good
lacing
down
the
sides
the
aroma
on
this
beer
is
not
very
strong
but
it
is
sweet
and
pleasant
youll
have
no
idea
that
this
beer
is
10
abv
just
a
little
warmth
on
the
finish
the
complexities
of
the
flavor
in
this
thing
are
awesome
it
starts
off
kinda
sweet
and
creamy
but
in
the
end
becomes
a
little
dry
and
lingers
for
quite
some
time
i
do
recommend
getting
this
if
you
can
now
i
need
to
find
the
black
n
blue
d
while
this
does
get
a
bit
cloying
after
a
while
dfh
should
be
commended
for
making
a
beer
so
unique
and
delicious
if
you
have
any
wine
drinker
you
are
trying
to
convert
to
beer
give
this
one
a
try
d
the
abv
is
well
hidden
but
its
too
sweet
and
a
bit
too
heavy
pairing
it
with
a
salty
cheese
helps
cut
the
sweetness
a
bit
but
the
beer
in
and
of
itself
seemed
to
miss
the
mark
a
bit
d
a
stanning
ovation
for
dogfish
another
great
crafted
brew
this
will
not
be
the
last
bottle
that
i
drink
great
beer
to
share
with
someone
else
that
appreciates
good
craftmanship
of
the
beer
making
world
this
is
a
brew
for
the
ages
a
very
interesting
beer
quite
unique
i
appreciate
the
effort
but
i
really
do
not
like
the
oak
character
on
a
witbier
it
somehow
clashes
with
the
spicesyeast
so
in
a
nutshell
doesnt
look
great
or
smell
great
but
tastes
pretty
darn
good
i
would
buy
this
one
again
drinkability
very
disappointed
ive
heard
great
things
from
friends
and
took
the
recommedation
after
putting
this
beer
of
for
years
the
worst
dfh
beer
i
have
had
by
far
we
drank
this
alone
and
it
made
a
great
after
dinner
aperitif
but
im
excited
to
pair
this
with
food
in
the
future
im
thinking
cedar
planked
salmon
with
a
grape
reduction
sauce
mmmm
bottle
poured
a
rust
orange
color
with
a
slight
cloudiness
the
head
is
a
light
tan
with
about
1
finger
the
aroma
is
just
mediocre
in
my
opinion
a
little
bit
of
orange
and
spice
along
with
some
oak
the
flavor
is
interesting
orange
with
bitterness
but
balanced
with
some
sweetness
boozy
finish
medium
mouthfeel
just
an
ok
beer
in
my
opinion
nothing
to
great
or
bad
all
and
all
a
good
try
for
any
fan
of
the
dfh
line
of
beers
they
never
seem
to
disappoint
d
below
average
probably
couldnt
drink
a
full
22oz
bottle
drinkability
probably
should
be
served
like
a
port
split
among
many
i
wouldnt
get
it
again
too
sweet
this
is
a
new
one
quite
different
not
bad
notes
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
outstanding
witbier
with
all
the
complexity
and
character
that
i
love
d
pretty
tasty
but
definitely
not
what
one
might
hope
for
from
a
wit
on
a
nice
summer
night
a
bit
heavy
on
the
alcohol
flavor
but
overall
very
tasty
maybe
ill
store
some
away
for
the
fall
pours
from
a
bottle
with
a
redbrown
color
it
has
a
thin
white
head
when
served
in
a
snifter
or
wine
glass
it
has
a
wheaty
smell
and
reminds
me
of
weiss
beer
the
taste
however
seems
to
be
a
cross
between
a
citrus
flavor
and
a
alcoholie
belgian
beer
it
has
a
sweetness
at
the
end
of
a
sip
it
is
smooth
but
you
do
get
a
good
alcoholic
buzz
off
of
it
not
sure
id
drink
this
often
pours
a
clear
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
tan
head
smells
of
aged
grapes
oak
and
hot
ethanol
taste
is
oranges
oak
and
wine
up
front
with
a
tart
acidic
middle
and
a
spicy
woody
finish
taste
of
alcohol
is
present
mouthfeel
is
rich
medium
carbonation
drinkability
is
ok
it
gets
a
bit
cloying
after
awhile
and
the
alcohol
taste
gets
too
strong
seeing
as
how
expensive
this
was
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
this
is
my
first
foray
into
dogfishs
premium
line
looking
forward
to
trying
some
of
the
others
m
sharp
carbonation
with
an
odd
slick
body
pours
a
lightish
red
with
orangish
hue
thin
white
head
with
small
carbonation
present
upon
first
pour
some
heavy
sediment
is
present
in
suspension
aroma
of
grapes
and
orange
peel
strongly
present
the
corriander
is
there
but
im
fighting
for
much
else
i
dont
get
the
oak
staves
at
10
abv
its
a
little
on
the
sweet
tasting
side
but
it
finishes
dry
the
pinot
noir
juice
is
quite
evident
on
first
taste
as
with
the
orange
peel
and
likely
the
corriander
mouthfeel
is
nice
it
seems
like
a
complex
beer
that
gently
compliments
one
another
not
sure
how
drinkable
this
one
is
with
the
rarity
nature
of
the
release
and
10
abv
but
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
again
d
i
dunno
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
one
of
these
like
i
would
a
typical
wit
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
at
all
what
the
style
calls
for
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
is
more
like
a
belgian
strong
dark
ale
than
a
wit
25
6
ounce
bottle
poured
into
a
large
dfh
snifter
this
is
a
very
cloudy
orangered
color
with
around
an
inch
of
head
smells
of
oranges
cherries
peaches
and
honey
taste
has
a
strong
orange
component
with
some
other
spiciness
maybe
nutmeg
and
cloves
oak
is
prevalent
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
thick
and
creamy
fairly
heavy
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overbearing
dits
limited
release
and
kind
of
expensive
so
its
not
a
sessionable
or
goto
beer
but
it
is
still
quite
tasty
im
glad
i
split
the
beer
with
a
friend
instead
of
drinking
the
bottle
by
myself
d
glad
to
be
sharing
it
it
is
interesting
but
i
think
a
five
ounce
sampler
would
have
been
plenty
i
may
come
back
to
edit
this
after
it
warms
a
bit
and
the
flavor
rounds
out
d
medium
interesting
and
tasty
but
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
quite
the
interesting
beer
its
got
great
complexity
and
manages
to
retain
its
witbier
character
despite
all
of
its
modifications
its
certainly
not
an
everyday
drinker
and
it
may
be
a
while
before
i
revisit
it
but
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
suggest
fans
of
witbiers
and
experimental
beers
give
it
a
try
red
and
white
is
a
very
different
beer
and
a
very
good
one
if
they
keep
brewing
it
ill
keep
buying
it
this
beer
is
exciting
the
appearance
is
slightly
cloudy
yet
translucent
with
a
burntorangeruby
hue
and
tan
frothy
head
i
poured
mine
into
a
bordeaux
glass
and
my
nostrils
were
immediately
attacked
with
red
grapes
and
kumquats
the
initial
sips
are
hot
but
the
sweetness
of
the
juice
helps
mask
the
alcohol
nicely
there
does
seem
to
be
a
little
funky
orange
flavor
going
on
but
the
spice
aspects
help
blend
everything
together
the
aftertaste
is
mellow
and
your
mouth
salivates
for
another
sip
i
have
tasted
a
few
brews
that
utilize
wine
or
grape
juice
but
they
are
never
unanimous
this
red
and
white
however
is
remarkable
balanced
as
the
wine
flavors
are
intertwined
with
the
beer
flavors
i
think
some
aging
would
help
round
out
some
of
the
bitter
notes
but
overall
i
am
quite
pleased
with
this
choice
i
will
definitely
be
enjoying
this
again
md
the
carbonation
is
great
on
this
one
and
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
drinkable
as
i
went
back
for
a
second
glass
and
then
finished
off
the
bottle
as
well
drinking
the
entire
bottle
would
be
tough
but
like
the
black
and
blue
its
a
great
beer
to
share
and
was
perfect
for
tonights
bbq
i
doubt
ill
be
picking
up
another
bottle
of
this
since
dfh
has
so
many
more
that
i
want
to
try
i
still
admire
their
courage
and
craftsmanship
and
they
deserve
points
for
the
effort
but
this
is
one
of
their
misses
the
taste
is
something
unique
the
beer
doesnt
have
that
same
corbonated
feel
to
it
instead
it
is
replaced
w
a
wine
texture
but
beerhopps
taste
and
slight
citrus
after
taste
which
does
not
ruin
the
beer
d
share
this
750ml
with
a
friend
this
beer
pours
out
a
thick
amber
with
a
good
deal
of
whitish
foamy
head
the
head
dissipates
quickly
giving
off
some
pleasant
aromas
of
coriander
and
a
sweetness
thats
probably
from
the
pinot
grapes
the
taste
matches
the
scent
with
coriander
making
up
the
majority
of
the
flavor
but
the
grapes
that
are
used
in
this
beer
give
it
a
pleasant
sweetness
that
helps
mask
the
high
abv
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
which
again
is
surprising
due
to
the
high
abv
all
in
all
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
drinkability
is
high
just
because
i
really
love
the
flavors
not
cloying
but
sweet
and
sexy
would
certainly
have
again
and
again
and
again
d
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
very
smooth
and
flavorful
definitely
recommended
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
d
this
one
is
really
good
with
a
great
nose
and
complex
flavors
that
balance
out
nicely
good
offering
from
dfh
d
this
would
be
a
great
food
beer
but
is
easy
to
drink
alone
deasy
drinking
just
plain
good
dogfish
head
red
white
poured
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
no
head
it
smelt
spicey
and
similair
to
a
wine
the
taste
was
rather
complex
it
had
a
warming
flavor
to
it
with
a
heavy
flavor
from
the
pinot
juice
it
was
difficult
to
drink
and
seemed
similar
to
wine
overall
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
fancy
meal
and
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
worth
a
try
but
too
expensive
notes
nice
and
one
almost
feels
that
this
could
be
a
great
social
brew
to
entice
some
outsiders
but
in
the
end
it
may
be
a
bit
much
this
beer
is
certainly
worth
your
time
i
enjoyed
drinkability
i
would
prefer
drinking
this
over
champagne
any
day
so
would
be
a
very
suitable
replacement
for
a
special
occasion
i
liked
the
fusion
of
the
witbier
and
strong
ale
styles
you
can
definitely
get
elements
of
both
in
this
brew

im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
dfh
as
i
feel
their
bigger
beers
are
gimmicky
and
too
aggressively
sweet
i
was
hesitating
to
buy
this
because
of
those
reasons
and
its
ridiculous
15
price
tag
i
just
happened
to
find
this
a
little
ways
out
of
town
for
only
9
so
went
ahead
and
i
am
not
disappointed
probably
my
favorite
by
this
brewery
alcohol
was
definitely
present
to
the
nose
and
tounge
was
not
too
much
nor
too
little
just
enough
to
compliment
the
flavors
mentioned
above
summary
this
is
my
first
dogfish
head
experience
i
am
willing
to
try
more
of
their
products
as
i
think
this
beer
is
a
pretty
good
personally
im
not
into
red
wine
and
this
beer
evokes
a
lot
of
red
wine
for
me
this
isnt
to
say
that
the
beer
is
bad
because
its
not
but
if
you
really
dislike
red
wine
then
you
might
be
a
little
jaded
when
trying
this
one
out
the
taste
is
a
genuine
melange
of
flavors
and
this
beer
really
does
stretch
the
palate
and
push
outwards
in
all
the
right
directions
there
is
a
very
lemony
twang
lots
of
tangerine
acerbicness
from
the
orange
peel
there
is
spiciness
from
the
coriander
and
there
is
a
nice
woody
herbal
and
malty
presence
that
comes
from
the
barrel
aging
there
is
also
a
vinous
quality
a
bit
cloying
and
sweet
but
vinous
nevertheless
from
the
pinot
noir
foundations
of
this
beer
the
abv
orange
twang
and
lemony
citrus
cut
through
the
syrupy
consistency
to
create
quite
a
brew
this
beer
is
maximally
complex
and
worth
seeking
out
the
abv
is
well
hidden
and
there
is
only
a
slight
pineapple
boozy
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
liqueur
like
lchaim
d
definitely
a
nice
idea
from
dfh
but
another
one
of
their
beers
that
did
not
quite
hit
the
mark
for
me
anyway
the
10
abv
doesnt
really
do
much
for
me
either
but
at
least
its
fairly
well
hidden
shared
a
magnum
of
this
with
a
group
of
friends
this
bottle
has
been
sitting
in
my
cellar
for
over
two
years
decanted
into
white
wine
glasses
really
interesting
color
a
goldenreddish
nice
foamy
head
that
mostly
disappears
very
strong
aromas
of
the
orange
peel
coriander
and
a
sweet
red
wine
like
a
fruiter
white
ale
huge
taste
of
the
coriander
little
bit
of
citrus
finishes
smoothly
but
with
a
lot
of
red
wine
tannens
almost
a
little
too
bitter
fairly
light
bodied
with
still
a
good
effervescence
overall
interesting
to
drink
a
lot
going
on
if
a
little
unbalanced
pours
a
nice
hazy
reddish
amber
with
a
parchment
head
that
is
made
up
of
fine
bubbles
and
has
great
retention
and
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
sharp
and
spicy
with
plenty
of
coriander
very
pleasant
and
understated
with
just
a
bit
of
wine
like
aroma
the
taste
is
very
belgian
nice
spicy
yeast
very
balanced
between
honey
and
grape
sweetness
and
a
nice
dry
character
you
can
definitely
taste
the
wheat
in
there
as
well
as
the
pinot
juice
but
where
is
the
wood
seems
to
suffer
from
a
common
issue
with
dfh
beers
as
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
the
more
this
beer
warms
the
more
the
pinot
comes
out
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
quite
effervescent
the
finish
is
a
tad
sweet
but
overall
quite
nice
this
beer
also
hides
its
strength
quite
well
fairly
drinkable
but
a
bit
hot
to
have
more
than
this
large
format
bottle
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
with
food
overall
a
very
unique
tasty
and
interesting
brew
that
i
would
buy
again
and
would
love
to
share
with
more
people
as
an
eyeopener
if
nothing
else
its
beers
like
this
that
display
the
versatilty
of
beer
as
a
beverage
and
an
art
as
well
as
the
ingenuity
of
experimental
brewers
d
tasty
and
worth
trying
im
not
in
a
hurry
to
try
it
again
though
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
375ml
was
more
than
enough
d
this
is
a
strong
beer
that
needs
to
be
sipped
it
has
a
unique
flavor
but
i
only
might
consider
having
this
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
out
of
the
ordinary
d
for
me
it
was
like
a
glass
of
wine
it
was
a
nice
beer
that
went
with
the
dinner
i
was
having
but
is
not
something
i
would
drink
more
than
a
glass
or
two
of
in
the
evening
it
was
an
interesting
beer
overall
had
the
flavors
of
both
wine
and
beer
but
didnt
give
me
a
headache
like
wine
normally
does
an
interesting
experience
feels
just
about
right
with
the
carbonation
factor
major
alcohol
burn
in
the
mouth
and
on
the
way
down
surprisingly
light
for
such
a
heavyweight
brew
great
feeling
though
drinkability
is
about
average
due
to
the
high
octane
of
this
brew
may
have
scored
higher
in
my
book
if
it
had
been
masked
a
bit
more
this
is
where
aging
this
one
would
certainly
prove
helpful
as
is
still
a
nice
beer
to
enjoy
may
pick
up
another
to
have
and
hold
for
a
bit
as
always
very
offcentered
ale
here
from
dogfish
though
certainly
respectable
drinkability
the
very
high
abv
isnt
very
well
hidden
it
feels
a
little
hot
however
all
this
stuff
the
taste
the
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
each
of
which
alone
isnt
amazing
works
pretty
damn
well
together
pours
a
reddish
golden
color
minimal
head
with
almost
no
lacing
aroma
is
citrus
and
yeast
overwhelmingly
so
definitely
taste
the
standard
witbier
flavors
however
not
much
of
the
pinot
comes
through
the
final
taste
is
pretty
balanced
especially
considering
the
complex
elements
involved
id
certainly
purchase
this
again
well
done
dfh
these
notes
were
taken
from
a
review
more
than
a
month
ago
after
learning
more
about
the
naming
convention
and
the
pinot
aspect
of
this
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
it
again
to
try
and
focus
less
on
the
wit
aspects
eh
im
not
terribly
impressed
just
because
you
can
mix
a
wit
and
red
wine
doesnt
mean
that
you
should
it
doesnt
help
that
the
wine
reminds
me
more
of
two
buck
chuck
than
a
truly
fine
beverage
i
probably
gave
this
a
higher
rating
than
i
normally
would
as
i
applaud
the
attempt
i
just
dont
really
like
this
beer
d
well
i
can
honestly
say
ive
never
had
an
oak
aged
imperial
belgian
wit
fermented
with
pinot
noir
juice
before
the
belgian
wit
base
is
nearly
obliterated
by
everything
else
that
follows
overall
the
brew
is
complex
but
flirts
with
nearly
doing
too
much
and
getting
jumbled
nearly
i
love
the
experimentation
here
crazy
and
i
will
say
the
further
i
got
into
this
beer
and
the
warmer
it
got
the
more
i
liked
it
really
opened
up
like
a
wine
carbonation
is
medium
high
and
mouthfeel
is
fairly
dry
overall
this
is
a
easy
drinking
beer
and
seems
like
it
would
go
well
with
a
lot
of
food
a
very
interesting
beer
quite
unique
however
it
is
too
oaky
tannic
and
warm
to
be
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
full
with
the
silkyness
that
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
wheat
has
carbonation
was
on
the
high
side
which
i
thought
was
complimentary
i
found
myself
taking
nice
small
sips
from
this
beer
in
order
to
appreciate
the
complexity
and
there
wasnt
any
hint
of
the
abv
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
witbiers
to
begin
with
so
take
this
review
with
any
necessary
grains
of
salt
this
beer
isnt
uninspired
just
boring
in
execution
the
taste
is
just
great
its
perfectly
balanced
not
too
sweet
and
carries
the
abv
incredibly
well
it
has
an
excellent
mouthfeel
a
full
bodied
taste
with
some
complexities
of
the
flavors
and
a
lasting
pleasant
after
taste
its
a
drinkable
beer
and
also
would
be
a
great
aging
canidate
dull
orange
color
with
a
little
bit
of
head
this
is
certainly
not
your
typical
beer
in
anyway
shape
or
form
to
me
almost
more
of
a
wine
taste
then
a
beer
if
youre
not
a
wine
lover
i
would
not
recomend
this
beer
for
you
thankfully
i
love
wine
also
enjoyed
this
beer
taste
a
little
bit
of
orange
citrus
like
flavor
but
that
barely
distingished
it
self
over
the
pinot
noir
also
the
10
abv
definitely
stands
out
in
this
beer
this
one
is
probably
a
sipper
no
big
gulps
here
has
an
orange
copper
color
with
a
little
sediment
floating
throughtout
smells
like
a
witbier
on
steriods
all
the
typical
witbier
aromas
orange
peel
coriandor
yeats
etc
but
with
something
extra
you
cant
really
put
your
finger
on
just
on
the
smell
alone
the
taste
explodes
with
orange
apricot
caramel
and
sweet
malt
the
pinot
noir
is
hard
to
distinguish
but
it
is
difinetly
a
very
complex
beer
showing
a
different
side
every
time
you
taste
it
i
would
have
to
agree
with
some
of
the
other
reviewers
and
say
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
strong
belgium
ale
more
than
a
witbier
d
with
each
of
their
750s
that
ive
tried
ive
become
less
interested
in
trying
another
dogfish
head
makes
some
really
excellent
12ozers
and
i
think
ill
just
stick
with
those
its
obvious
im
not
the
target
market
for
these
reserve
beers
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
drinkability
ehh
its
a
witbier
so
it
should
be
drinkable

is

this

it

it

enjoyed
it
much
more
the
second
time
this
beer
is
impressive
with
what
it
does
as
an
experiment
and
simply
how
tasty
it
is
i
would
recommend
trying
it
if
possible
maybe
some
age
might
help
my
least
favorite
dfh
product
i
had
heard
that
this
was
much
better
then
the
black
blue
and
i
really
cant
believe
the
difference
the
last
left
me
bitter
and
indigent
and
was
pretty
amateur
stylee
the
price
was
downright
criminal
however
the
red
white
is
very
well
done
and
quite
enjoyable
a
total
night
day
tm
difference
while
they
still
cost
more
then
almost
all
the
best
belgians
out
there
which
is
total
bullshit
this
one
was
nevertheless
a
fine
brew
i
have
to
tip
my
hat
to
the
delaware
boys
for
this
one
although
they
owe
me
more
then
a
few
buybacks
the
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
with
some
fine
rolling
carbonation
flavor
is
sweet
and
fruity
but
also
lots
of
booze
that
is
warm
and
affects
the
finish
with
some
lingering
peppery
bitterness
i
am
not
sure
what
the
goal
of
this
beer
was
and
i
dont
really
find
the
coriander
or
orange
peel
anywhere
as
the
booze
seems
to
overwhelm
most
flavors
i
am
disappointed
with
this
beer
and
would
not
buy
it
again

drinkability
i
find
this
very
drinkable
but
very
pricy
at
almost
13
a
bottle
and
the
abv
is
going
to
get
to
you
before
long
i
may
get
one
for
cellaring
though
hmmm
pours
a
gorgeous
dark
raspberry
color
quite
cloudy
with
just
a
thin
covering
of
a
sparingly
bubbly
white
head
aroma
is
dominated
by
wheat
followed
by
the
said
spices
coriander
and
orange
a
slight
bit
of
fruit
comes
through
but
i
wouldnt
have
noticed
it
unless
someone
told
me
in
the
mouth
it
really
just
comes
across
as
a
strong
creamy
wit
the
pinot
is
starting
to
come
through
but
right
now
it
is
just
so
subtle
the
oak
is
there
to
give
a
little
bit
of
structure
and
ground
things
but
its
not
so
strong
i
pulled
it
out
of
the
fridge
about
40
min
ago
and
it
is
still
to
cold
so
things
are
a
bit
dull
the
mouthfeel
is
very
full
medium
carbonation
and
quite
heavy
and
slick
but
not
overly
sweet
the
finish
hints
at
some
fruitiness
but
its
just
not
in
the
level
i
was
expecting
i
had
midas
touch
in
mind
it
is
an
interesting
taste
just
nothing
earth
shattering
poured
from
the
750ml
bottle
into
a
wine
glass
body
is
a
slightly
cloudy
reddish
orange
color
topped
by
a
small
wispy
stark
white
head
fairly
sweet
aroma
imparted
from
the
grapes
along
with
the
subtle
nuances
of
a
witbier
orange
peel
coriander
and
light
wheat
palate
is
initially
sweet
with
a
faceoff
between
the
competing
elements
of
sweet
grapes
and
tart
witbier
notes
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
emerge
midpalate
before
melding
into
the
fairly
dry
finish
a
tad
thinbodied
for
a
beer
that
contains
so
much
alcohol
nonetheless
this
is
a
highly
interesting
beer
and
im
glad
dfh
undertook
this
experiment
overall
not
bad
a
decent
fruitvegetable
style
specialty
beer
nicely
balanced
and
drinkable
definitely
a
niche
beer
though
especially
at
15
nothing
id
pursue
normally
worth
a
try
the
only
flaws
i
find
in
this
beer
are
the
price
and
availability
can
taste
the
pinot
noir
influence
on
this
beer
and
it
is
just
right
this
is
the
winelovers
beer
because
it
refeshes
you
with
all
the
flavors
you
expect
in
a
beer
and
wine
simultaneoulsy
gotta
love
this
experiment
the
alcohol
level
was
just
right
not
like
some
others
which
just
yell
sugar
at
the
higher
alcohol
level
will
drink
this

i
have
to

i

this
beer
now
i

to

a
couple
more

to
save
and
savor
definitely
try
if
you
have
the
chance
im

wit
beers
nor
wine
but
i
am
a
dfh
fan
so
i
had
to
give
this
a
try
the
color
is
beautiful
somewhere
between
a
burnt
orange
and
cherry
red
aroma
is
all
corianderwit
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
plus
some
cherry
orange
peel
and
oak
notes
i
dont
get
a
lot
of
wine
except
maybe
in
the
moutheel
which
is
pleasantly
sharp
i
dont
want
to
write
this
off
as
simply
an
interesting
experiment
because
its
more
than
that
but
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
that
of
a
witbier
its
very
dry
feeling
making
the
combination
between
this
and
pinot
work
quite
well
this
is
a
very
tastey
drinkable
brew
kudos
to
the
guys
at
dogfish
head
for
making
this
i
had
originally
given
this
a
2
5
on
taste
however
several
minutes
after
i
posted
this
review
perhaps
40
or
so
the
beer
has
warmed
significantly
and
oddly
enough
the
alcohol
is
much
less
noticeable
and
much
less
offensive
warm
than
chilled
this
beer
is
probably
22c
72f
it
isnt
even
cool
its
definitely
room
temperature
and
it
is
much
more
enjoyable
at
this
much
warmer
temperature
there
is
also
a
yeasty
element
that
wasnt
noticeable
when
the
liquid
was
chilled
the
abv
is
pretty
noticeable
in
this
beer
and
is
another
dfh
i
probably
could
not
drink
a
lot
of
still
its
a
nice
beer
if
not
hugely
impressive
interesting
beer
last
thing
this
is
not
a
witbier
more
of
a
fruit
vegetable
drinkability
pretty
decent
overall
drinkability
here
the
dryness
gets
a
bit
tiring
near
the
end
of
the
bottle
if
you
want
to
try
a
different
beer
this
is
one
to
find
for
such
a
complex
brewing
process
with
pinot
noir
juice
added
and
aged
in
a
split
of
pinot
noir
and
white
oak
casks
i
was
a
bit
let
down
that
there
wasnt
more
complexity
to
the
flavor
the
overall
effect
was
more
like
a
dubbel
substantial
tannic
bitterness
up
front
with
some
malty
sweetness
which
pulled
up
a
bit
short
slightly
acidic
at
the
finish
the
witbier
origin
was
totally
overshadowed
by
the
subsequent
addtions
and
aging
and
the
orange
and
coriander
notes
seemed
out
of
place
nonetheless
this
is
an
interesting
beer
to
experience
this
is
so
sweet
and
syrupy
its
not
the
most
drinkable
brew
but
is
enjoyable
as
an
after
dinner
drink
to
share
right
off
the
bat
you
notice
the
reddish
tint
in
some
light
it
looks
like
a
cherry
lambic
no
real
head
to
speak
of
the
smell
is
hard
to
describe
grapes
yeast
and
a
hint
of
cherry
or
is
that
my
nose
just
trying
to
agree
with
my
eyes
crisp
tart
up
front
followed
by
a
nice
malt
a
very
grainy
flavor
the
finish
is
tart
sour
but
satisfyingly
so
the
citrus
notes
come
out
at
the
end
very
difficult
to
nail
down
this
one
good
though
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
has
decent
carbonation
and
a
nice
heftiness
almost
chewy
but
really
just
substantial
drinkability
im
not
sure
yet
i
dont
think
id
have
a
lot
of
these
but
maybe
ill
change
my
mind
further
through
the
bottle
at
750ml
and
10
there
is
a
lot
of
room
for
change
oelergud
very
interesting
looking
witbier
pours
a
cherry
amber
hue
with
a
very
nice
looking
offwhite
with
a
slight
hint
of
pink
in
the
head
lacing
is
quite
sticky
throughout
cant
wait
to
give
this
one
a
taste
first
smell
that
hits
me
is
bananas
for
sure
pretty
much
what
i
expceted
with
a
wheattype
beer
definitely
can
sense
a
bit
of
white
wine
odor
to
it
but
not
as
alcoholy
as
i
had
expected
in
the
odor
for
10
good
coriander
odor
is
present
as
well
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
strong
bananayeast
flavor
coming
at
ya
definite
dark
fruit
flavoring
biting
the
tounge
as
well
cherries
plum
grapes
the
wine
flavoring
to
me
wasnt
as
present
in
the
flavor
as
it
was
in
the
smell
but
you
can
definitely
detect
it
the
aftertaste
is
almost
applelike
and
a
bit
dry
but
very
pleasing
high
carbonation
on
this
one
but
doesnt
take
away
from
the
brew
whatsoever
if
i
didnt
know
the
abv
was
10
before
i
drank
it
i
would
assume
it
to
be
a
67
so
im
obviously
giving
the
drinkability
of
this
one
a
high
score
if
you
like
beer
try
it
if
you
like
wine
try
it
if
you
like
dfh
try
it
if
you
like
fruit
try
it
so
basically
pick
one
up
and
share
it
with
all
good
work
once
again
dfh
reddishbrown
hue
cloudy
with
thin
carbonation
clears
a
bit
after
warming
may
have
been
some
chill
haze
on
the
second
pour
from
the
bomber
the
carbonation
livensup
thick
fluffy
head
with
tiny
bubbles
that
thin
a
bit
but
its
quite
impressive
strong
leather
aroma
balances
with
tart
berry
subtle
banana
very
light
cloves
and
esters
typical
of
a
wheat
in
the
background
maybe
not
necesssarily
spicy
as
a
wit
but
a
nice
aroma
something
more
citruslike
and
akin
to
orange
is
the
strongest
flavor
noticeable
at
first
which
i
did
not
expect
given
its
color
after
a
few
sips
helped
adjust
the
palate
things
balancedout
and
i
find
that
a
smoothely
complex
beer
appears
somewhat
sour
at
first
this
mellows
into
a
dry
finish
seems
belgianesque
from
my
unsophisticated
and
limited
perspective
edit
had
my
second
750
and
my
opinion
is
only
strengthened
pick
one
up
nice
to
drink
definitely
one
of
the
more
drinkable
10
beers
ive
had
witbier
is
an
inappropriate
description
of
the
style
id
call
it
a
strong
belgian
ale
a
strong
yummy
belgian
ale
complex
and
interesting
i
had
some
hopes
for
this
brew
while
it
is
not
as
unbalanced
as
some
of
dogfish
heads
higher
alcohol
brews
i
am
quite
surprised
by
the
tangelo
character
here
it
is
not
really
evocative
of
citrus
dont
get
me
wrong
there
are
some
notes
here
all
in
all
this
brew
is
a
disappointment
it
seems
to
lack
a
depth
of
flavor
and
a
finesse
that
i
was
hoping
for
plus
it
just
doesnt
say
wit
to
me
either
at
least
there
are
no
off
flavors
here
it
is
just
that
this
combination
of
flavors
just
dont
hold
my
interest
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slick
with
an
overly
thick
body
so
it
rushes
into
your
stomach
like
water
down
a
slide
to
create
the
ultimate
stomach
ache
not
too
drinkable
in
my
mind
as
you
can
tell
you
can
get
a
quality
bottle
of
pinot
noir
hayman
hill
and
a
single
of
wit
for
cheaper
and
enjoy
them
on
their
own
for
what
they
are
pours
a
ruby
body
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
an
offpink
thin
head
that
leaves
some
thin
lacing
not
very
interesting
in
the
nose
i
dont
pick
up
anything
aside
from
what
i
went
in
thinking
this
beer
would
be
like
a
high
abv
witbier
with
some
grape
juice
in
it
tastes
highly
sugary
medicinal
and
with
an
odd
bitterness
reminds
me
of
hey
a
high
abv
wit
with
too
much
residual
sweetness
and
some
juicy
juice
littlebit
of
tannins
but
its
faint
mouthfeel
is
heavy
slick
oily
and
mildly
carbonated
glad
im
splitting
this
with
someone
else
but
it
would
be
better
splitting
this
with
about
10
people
drinkability
pretty
light
body
and
nottoooverwhelming
flavor
profile
make
this
a
nice
spring
sipper
i
wouldnt
go
back
for
another
however
the
beer
poured
a
rich
red
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
that
was
slow
to
diminish
and
left
slight
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
had
both
the
characteristics
of
a
witbier
and
the
fruitiness
of
a
red
wine
the
taste
was
one
of
the
most
unique
things
ive
ever
experienced
this
beer
had
all
the
characteristics
i
expect
in
a
witbier
with
the
taste
of
pinot
noir
just
as
advertised
even
though
i
dont
drink
wine
very
often
pinot
noir
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
the
tastes
that
come
through
in
this
beer
make
this
a
wonderful
experience
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
that
is
worth
every
penny
even
at
11
99750ml
pours
an
amber
and
copper
color
mainly
clear
with
a
small
off
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
nice
sweet
wheaty
aroma
with
coriander
and
orange
very
evident
also
some
sweet
berry
aroma
a
hint
of
tart
cherry
and
a
whiff
of
the
alcohol
strength
also
in
the
aroma
sweet
wheat
and
coriander
soft
and
full
float
across
the
tongue
a
somewhat
tart
and
crsip
cherry
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
and
balances
the
sweetness
a
nice
red
wine
and
berry
flavor
is
less
noticeable
but
also
in
the
mix
a
very
nice
full
wheaty
mouthfeel
is
balanced
well
by
a
tingling
hoppiness
and
a
decent
dryness
from
the
hops
and
oak
aging
the
beer
is
well
balanced
for
its
strength
the
alcohol
is
evident
but
not
overpowering
a
very
nice
spring
time
beer
a
750
might
be
too
much
for
one
but
great
to
share
in
anticipation
of
summer
a
bit
of
warmth
on
the
way
down
from
the
10
abv
but
not
ridiculous
imo
really
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
one
i
might
buy
it
again
if
the
price
was
right
lighter
body
and
well
carbonated
almost
spritzy
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
only
a
hint
of
warming
very
nice
is
is
really
possible
for
a
beer
that
is
10
to
be
refreshing
in
this
case
yes
thanks
to
jasonm
and
the
florida
gators
for
the
beer
an
ok
beer
but
one
that
could
have
been
much
much
better
with
a
bit
of
restraint
i
could
totally
see
this
as
a
slightly
higher
abv
witte
7
maybe
it
just
needs
to
be
toned
down
so
that
the
flavors
have
a
chance
to
stand
out
more
sadly
this
makes
it
a
bit
of
a
dissappointment
for
me
i
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
beer
my
second
bottle
is
going
in
the
back
of
the
closet
lets
see
what
a
little
age
does
for
this
pours
a
red
color
with
a
tall
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
sweet
and
fruity
with
citrus
overtones
the
flavor
has
all
the
corriander
and
orange
peel
you
could
want
but
there
is
another
spice
in
there
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
im
thinking
caraway
or
cumin
lost
of
malty
sweetness
in
the
flavor
to
go
with
the
spices
and
the
citrus
flavors
very
odd
and
very
interesting
also
very
tasty
the
alcohol
comes
through
in
the
flavor
but
doesnt
overpower
it
in
any
way
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
considering
the
alcohol
very
drinkable
and
desirable
pours
an
iced
tea
redamber
color
with
a
half
finger
head
aroma
is
cherry
oak
and
wine
taste
is
grapes
sweet
malts
wheats
and
dark
fruits
reminiscent
of
a
barleywine
but
not
exactly
sweeter
than
anticipated
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
minimal
carbonation
relatively
drinkable
nice
with
italian
food

expensive
side

definitely
not
a

nice

it
has
a
solid

accompanied
by
blueberry

aromas
and
flavor
collide
hand
in
hand
very
smooth
and
the
hops
balance
very
well
with
the
fruity
flavor
easy
drinking
beer
this
is
a
great
accomplishment
with
wine
and
beer
flavors
awesome
summer
beer
tastes
almost
like
a
lambic
minus
the
sour
flavor
is
equally
as
intriguing
dry
wheat
and
belgian
pale
malt
notes
with
dry
oak
and
grape
must
the
witte
character
is
hard
to
pin
down
i
think
i
can
taste
the
subtle
nuances
of
orange
peel
and
spice
but
maybe
its
just
cuz
i
know
theyre
in
there
certain
characteristics
of
the
pinot
noir
clash
with
the
bitter
hop
finish
and
the
alcohol
is
hot
it
tastes
better
with
food
the
pinot
noir
nuances
are
more
obvious
and
certain
aspects
of
the
wittebier
base
come
through
as
it
warms
i
honestly
think
this
will
improve
dramatically
with
a
little
cellar
time
i
was
expecting
something
akin
to
allagash
interlude
based
on
the
ingredient
and
brewing
profile
but
this
is
certainly
its
own
unique
creation
as
usual
dfh
has
managed
to
twist
and
manipulate
styles
to
create
something
utterly
new

different

beer
this

another

from

the

is
made
up

of

and
some
tart

as
well
as
some

and
spice
the
taste
has

and
some

there
is
also
some
slightly

running

the

as
well
in
both
the
aroma
and
taste
you
can
definitely
detect
some
of
its
belgian
characteristics
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
extremely
enjoyable
brew
that
is
highly
recommended
i
think
i
am
going
to
have
to
go
buy
a
couple
more
bottles
of
this
stuff
this
would
be
a
great
and
refreshing
summer
beer
although
perhaps
also
a
bit
dangerous
but
i
doubt
there
will
be
any
left
by
then
drinkability
interesting
enough
but
im
not
sure
i
would
drink
this
again
this
is
extreme
beer
done
right
warping
guidelines
and
stretching
perceptions
its
too
big
and
chewy
to
be
a
fastdrinking
screaming
mimi
but
it
goes
down
warm
with
a
bold
abv
that
grants
a
grin
to
go
along
with
lifted
eyebrows
so
keep
on
keepin
on
shark
boys
the
more
of
this
i
drink
the
more
i
like
it
dfh
is
very
hit
or
miss
imo
especially
with
its
special
release
oddities
but
they
hit
it
out
of
the
park
on
this
one
dogfish
head
delivers
again
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
this
by
all
means
give
it
a
try
its
such
an
innovative
and
unique
beer
im
really
happy
i
got
to
try
this
personally
i
did
not
like
this
brew
but
my
wife
really
enjoy
it
alot
and
purchased
more
i
do
have
to
take
into
account
that
this
a
dogfish
head
brew
which
is
an
extreme
experience
everytime
with
that
said
i
will
be
fair
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
a
bit
thick
and
syrupy
at
10
abv
it
is
big
and
it
definitely
packs
a
sweet
punch
overall
its
worth
a
try
one
of
the
more
interesting
beers
ive
tried
in
a
while
a
little
too
sweet
for
it
to
be
a
favorite
but
certainly
novel
and
unique
try
it
i
spent
over
an
hour
and
a
half
with
this
bottle
and
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
eric
this
is
one
that
i
would
like
to
have
on
hand
more
often
very
drinkable
and
it
is
a
nice
balance
with
all
the
different
elements
going
on
here
beautiful
presentation
beautiful
beer
i
had
lost
faith
in
dfh
large
bottled
beers
after
a
couple
of
missteps
with
golden
shower
and
fort
but
this
is
a
true
return
to
form
a
totally
out
there
concept
brewed
with
panache
and
pulled
off
to
almost
perfection
taste
sweet
and
fruity
shows
that
dfh
know
how
to
make
beers
with
solid
malt
backbones
and
they
didnt
overdo
it
with
the
barrel
aging
that
often
strips
the
maltyness
away
and
it
hides
the
11
dangerously
well
you
can
feel
a
certain
raisin
aftertaste
and
the
oak
was
only
a
minor
participant
in
the
flavor
profile
kudos
for
that
and
for
an
overall
very
well
made
beer
a
complex
higher
abv
brew
this
is
best
appreciated
when
sipped
another
fine
showing
by
dogfish
head
wow
what
a
great
beer
seriously
how
do
i
put
into
words
how
impressed
with
this
one
from
dog
fish
let
me
start
with
pour
it
had
very
little
head
and
poured
a
nice
clear
ale
brown
the
smell
was
rather
complex
im
dealing
with
allergies
so
i
couldnt
pick
out
anything
specific
but
i
could
tell
this
would
going
to
be
something
special
the
taste
was
not
at
all
over
powering
it
was
both
sweet
and
spicy
this
is
definitely
worth
picking
up
nicereddish
hue
to
it
quite
the
fluffy
white
head
earthy
aromaa
lot
of
yeasty
notes
great
malty
flavorvery
crisp
and
clean
tasting
quiet
wine
flavor
to
it
slight
spicy
flavors
very
smooth
and
full
bodied
no
way
this
is
12
and
this
clean
tasting
and
feeling
very
very
drinkable
beer
extremely
enjoyable
great
all
over
once
again
dfh
does
not
let
me
down
i
was
very
afraid
that
this
would
be
overly
sweet
like
the
fort
but
i
am
very
pleased
with
the
balance
and
finesse
this
has
incredibly
well
made
and
very
very
enjoyable
and
for
only
11
49
for
a
750
ml
i
think
its
a
pretty
good
deal
as
well
ill
be
buying
a
few
more
some
to
drink
and
some
to
cellar
i
dont
think
this
needs
to
age
at
all
but
id
be
curious
to
see
what
happens
after
a
few
years
recommended
if
you
see
it
pick
it
up
the
complexity
alone
blows
me
away
i
cant
even
imagine
how
many
test
batches
it
took
to
get
this
right
served
by
the
bartender
from
750ml
bottle
into
a
red
wine
glass
pours
out
a
brilliant
clear
red
some
white
head
but
fades
quickly
didnt
leave
a
lace
aroma
shows
the
wit
spicing
of
coriander
and
orange
but
also
hints
at
the
fruitiness
has
something
vaguely
sharp
as
well
that
i
cant
quite
place
flavor
is
strange
another
queer
bird
from
dfh
fruit
pinot
noir
juice
and
wood
oak
definitely
show
up
more
in
the
flavor
but
ends
up
mixing
into
a
complex
whole
alcohol
also
shows
in
the
flavor
not
in
an
objectionable
way
warming
perhaps
but
the
beer
seems
lighter
than
the
10
abv
shown
on
the
bottle
at
least
at
first
it
does
seem
to
build
on
you
huge
yeastiness
as
well
vaguely
more
like
a
tripel
perhaps
in
that
respect
reminds
me
of
the
chimay
yeast
definitely
interesting
but
also
confusing
other
than
punting
with
a
cheesecourse
matching
im
honestly
not
sure
what
to
do
with
this
beer
maybe
as
you
would
use
a
frozen
sorbet
as
a
palate
cleanser
pours
ruby
red
in
color
obviously
from
the
pinot
noir
barrel
ageing
aroma
is
wine
and
fruit
good
mouth
feel
effervescent
and
full
flavor
is
boozy
and
full
but
you
can
taste
the
corriander
in
the
background
this
a
typical
dogfish
head
offering
unique
and
well
done
yet
not
fitting
exactly
into
a
bjcp
catagory
i
e
comparing
this
one
to
hoegaarden
sterkens
white
or
wittekerke
is
not
fair
definitely
not
apples
to
apples
more
like
apples
to
tangelos
in
this
case
tell
you
what
in
my
personal
scene
from
an
italian
restauarnt
ill
take
this
anyday
over
a
bottle
of
red
a
bottle
of
white
or
a
bottle
of
rose
dogfish
head
red
and
white
were
a
truly
exceptional
beer
the
beer
pours
out
an
orange
body
with
a
slight
offwhite
head
that
faded
into
a
thin
covering
across
the
top
bringing
the
beer
to
the
nose
there
is
a
huge
whiff
of
belgian
wit
yeast
and
coming
up
behind
it
were
orange
peels
and
coriander
with
a
faint
aroma
of
pinot
noire
the
taste
like
the
nose
was
dominated
by
the
belgian
wit
yeast
however
unlike
the
nose
the
taste
of
pinot
noire
was
much
more
present
very
little
fusel
alcohol
notes
were
present
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
for
being
such
a
high
gravity
beer
it
was
extremely
light
on
the
palate
with
an
extremely
refreshing
mouth
feel
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
extremely
high
it
went
down
smooth
and
left
me
wanting
more
my
girlfriend
and
i
shared
a
bottle
of
this
with
brunch
some
steak
and
eggs
and
hash
browns
this
beer
was
strong
enough
to
hold
up
to
the
steak
but
also
delicate
enough
not
to
over
power
the
eggs
it
was
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
and
to
pair
wow
yet
another
fantastic
creation
from
dogfish
a
wonderful
marriage
of
beer
wine
that
i
found
to
be
both
quite
quaffable
enjoyable
wow
dfh
has
come
up
with
yet
another
palate
pleasing
concoction
if
the
abv
didnt
step
in
i
could
easily
drink
2
of
these
750s
in
one
sitting
if
you
enjoy
witbier
seek
this
one
out
the
wheat
and
yeast
are
first
in
the
flavor
but
gets
better
with
yeast
peppar
coriander
and
the
lightest
of
orange
zest
came
off
as
a
heartier
belgian
with
an
ultrastealthy
abv
only
noticed
that
height
of
it
after
my
head
warmed
up
after
the
first
glass
then
seeing
the
product
description
on
the
side
of
the
label
drinkability
is
pretty
high
which
becomes
problematic
when
my
head
started
getting
warm
if
it
were
slightly
lower
this
would
be
drinkable
as
all
get
out
red
white
pours
oddly
enough
neither
red
nor
white
but
an
orangey
copper
with
an
off
white
head
from
a
750
ml
brown
bottle
it
smells
like
a
witbier
with
some
musty
grape
smells
when
cold
it
tastes
like
a
wit
with
a
little
wine
thing
going
on
at
first
but
as
it
warms
the
wine
flavors
and
aromas
blossom
i
liked
it
i
wouldnt
drink
it
regularly
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
i
have
to
say
to
start
that
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
pinot
noir
in
addition
to
being
a
beer
lover
this
brew
was
fantastic
for
its
lovely
evocation
of
that
wine
as
well
as
having
great
beer
flavors
all
its
own
in
my
mind
it
is
the
perfect
marrriage
of
beer
and
wine
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
pinkish
orange
with
a
reasonable
head
that
fades
to
a
rim
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
some
slight
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
bubblegum
fresh
pressed
grapes
banana
and
cinnamon
there
is
also
a
whiff
of
clove
and
earth
slightly
sweet
on
the
nose
the
flavor
is
great
more
bubblegum
at
the
start
followed
by
a
nice
parade
of
pinot
noir
flavors
cherries
earth
some
oak
and
a
vague
grapiness
there
are
also
nice
notes
of
spice
coriander
cinnamon
and
clove
a
touch
of
vanilla
from
the
oak
just
before
the
finish
and
a
final
hit
of
sweet
cherries
right
at
the
end
absolutely
fantastic
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
creamy
and
with
the
perfect
heft
for
the
flavors
even
with
the
high
abv
this
beer
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
i
wanted
more
and
more
and
the
alcohol
was
not
discernable
at
all
the
wit
base
is
the
perfect
marriage
with
the
pinot
noir
flavors
a
stunner
a
750ml
capped
bottle
bottled
on
21207
poured
into
a
pint
glass
its
a
very
pretty
beer
nice
red
color
medium
white
head
wellcarbonated
pretty
good
lacing
aroma
a
little
nondescript
mostly
sweet
a
little
alcohol
aah
but
the
taste
strong
wine
taste
sweet
fruit
malt
reminiscent
of
a
belgian
very
smooth
and
delightful
one
to
try
this
beer
poured
a
clear
red
color
and
formed
a
foamy
white
head
that
coated
the
glass
with
lace
as
it
subsided
a
small
amount
of
carbonation
was
present
an
aroma
of
wheat
citrus
coriander
pepper
and
a
hint
of
wine
the
flavor
was
of
wheat
citrus
and
pepper
it
has
a
medium
light
body
odd
for
a
supposed
whit
beer
a
sweet
finish
to
the
beer
none
of
the
alcohol
can
really
be
detected
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
doesnt
know
what
it
wants
to
be
i
guess
i
got
this
on
tap
at
the
gaithersburg
alehouse
it
was
served
in
a
snifter
and
had
a
brilliant
red
body
with
a
perfectly
white
head
the
smell
was
less
powerful
than
i
would
have
liked
but
still
a
very
good
fruity
aroma
there
is
a
hint
of
the
alcohol
in
the
aroma
and
some
in
the
taste
as
well
but
that
is
somewhat
to
be
expected
in
a
10
abv
beer
the
flavor
is
an
excellent
blend
of
a
wit
and
pinot
noir
there
is
a
light
fruity
belgian
funk
in
there
and
then
the
smoothness
of
a
wine
blends
it
together
it
is
very
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
especially
considering
the
abv
which
is
great
because
it
comes
in
the
750ml
big
girl
bottle
the
winefruit
whitbier
makes
a
wonderful
combination
that
i
will
recommend
to
others
i
am
thrilled
that
we
can
finally
get
dogfishhead
beers
in
my
state
and
this
did
not
disappoint
drinkability
this
is
very
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
the
wine
wheat
makes
a
wonderful
combination
that
i
plan
on
sharing
another
bottle
soon
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
very
full
body
for
a
witbier
the
carbonation
breaks
up
the
body
a
bit
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
much
for
the
style
this
beer
is
odd
in
a
very
tasty
and
satisfying
way
this
is
a
very
unique
beer
drinking
experience
and
i
would
reccommend
it
to
others
and
clean
it
doesnt
leave
any
kind
of
residue
in
the
mouth
it
is
very
clean
i
will
look
for
this
again
i
have
been
eagerly
anticipating
this
release
as
a
fan
of
most
things
dogfish
head
and
pinot
noir
the
addition
of
pinot
noir
juice
has
lended
a
hint
of
burgundy
to
the
color
a
relatively
slow
first
pour
yielded
a
small
white
head
that
was
somewhat
fizzy
and
faded
without
much
lacing
a
bit
of
the
grape
comes
through
in
the
nose
as
well
as
the
coriander
and
wheat
the
mouthfeel
is
full
with
a
slight
creamy
slickness
that
has
just
a
touch
of
prickle
on
the
tongue
from
the
carbonation
the
grapes
add
depth
and
a
subtle
sweetness
that
compliments
the
sourness
of
the
wheat
malts
the
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
which
makes
for
a
higher
drinkablity
considering
its
10
abv
the
barrel
aging
no
doubt
helps
smooth
out
some
of
the
rougher
edges
and
helps
conceal
its
true
potency
fuller
bodied
wit
with
the
alcohol
hidden
really
well
i
couldnt
make
it
through
the
whole
750ml
bottle
myself
luckily
my
wife
was
here
to
help
me
finish
it
and
she
wasnt
overwhelmed
by
it
either
red
tinged
amber
that
pours
with
a
pink
cast
and
initially
looked
liked
some
sort
of
pink
sparkling
wine
or
soda
a
cushiony
frothy
head
of
dirty
white
foam
with
a
brush
of
pink
rests
atop
slow
moving
small
bubbled
carbonation
columns
laze
upwards
the
head
steadily
settles
itself
coming
to
rest
at
a
thin
skim
and
leaving
webby
lace
only
at
the
top
orange
rind
and
sweet
red
wine
aromas
are
fruity
and
reminiscent
of
sangria
there
is
a
bit
of
spiciness
beneath
the
fruit
but
overall
it
has
a
fairly
sweet
nose
coriander
is
strong
initially
but
the
red
wine
sweetness
comes
on
strong
and
overwhelms
this
mediumfull
body
with
just
a
bit
of
fine
carbonation
there
is
a
heaviness
to
the
mouthfeel
and
it
lacks
the
crispness
and
snap
of
a
wit
finishing
with
the
slimmest
drying
red
wine
edge
before
the
sweetness
again
washes
through
the
10
alcohol
is
fairly
well
hidden
which
is
a
plus
red
and
white
at
times
reminded
me
of
midas
touch
and
chateau
jiahu
this
seems
to
be
trying
to
be
too
many
things
without
doing
any
of
them
particularly
well
one
12
bottle
was
more
than
enough
and
in
actuality
a
single
glass
would
have
been
plenty
on
tap
at
the
dfh
brewpub
in
rehoboth
the
beer
poured
a
solid
golden
color
with
a
slight
white
head
that
didnt
last
long
but
gave
way
to
a
floating
island
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
and
some
solid
lacing
the
aroma
was
sort
of
like
your
typically
belgian
style
wit
as
it
had
touches
of
wheat
and
corriander
and
other
fruit
notes
but
it
also
had
a
bit
of
a
wine
touch
to
it
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
the
wheat
and
spices
come
to
the
surface
quickly
and
are
enjoyable
but
you
also
get
a
red
white
taste
which
makes
sense
as
this
brew
was
aged
in
pinot
noir
barrels
for
about
2
months
it
is
evident
that
they
brewed
this
with
freshly
ground
corriander
and
about
60
tangelos
as
you
get
the
spice
and
the
citrus
as
you
would
expect
in
a
wit
but
is
appear
to
be
fresher
this
wine
taste
is
not
at
all
overwhelming
but
compliments
the
other
tastes
going
on
and
the
folks
at
dfh
did
a
nice
job
of
hiding
the
high
abv
although
it
turns
it
at
12
you
cant
really
sense
it
that
much
just
a
touch
at
the
back
end
as
you
get
teh
wine
flavors
very
interesting
brew
and
worth
a
try
if
you
are
able
to
grab
a
glass
or
growler
of
it
before
it
is
all
gone
one
of
the
best
whites
i
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
o
a
well
balanced
wit
that
really
captures
the
belgian
wit
texture
and
flavor
really
nice
easy
to
drink
witbier
didnt
know
what
to
expect
was
pleasantly
surprised
love
this
beer
for
an
every
night
drink
with
dinner
great
with
burgers
clean
crisp
dry
refreshing
tasty
this
was
a
decent
and
interesting
beer
i
feel
like
it
would
make
a
good
summer
beer
not
something
i
am
likely
to
get
again
at
least
until
next
summer
perhaps
looks
great
but
light
on
overall
taste
it
is
a
quality
daytime
summer
beer
i
do
not
need
another
one
god
awful
herby
aftertaste
simply
bad
bad

this
one
really
piqued
my
interest

nice
and
smooth
overall
not
to
bad
but
with
out
a
doubt
not
near
the
top
feel
carbonation
on
the
high
side
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
this
is
what
a
witbier
should
taste
like
tons
of
bubbles
really
citrusy
with
a
nice
pop
of
spice
at
the
end
this
is
a
great
beer
dont
like
the
finish
at
the
end
doesnt
leave
my
palate
in
a
great
place
id
pass
very
spicey
for
a
witbier
coriander
peppery
lemony
zingy
but
not
overly
so
nice
and
refreshing
great
alone
or
with
shrimp
kabobs
unusual
taste
but
not
off
putting
worth
buying
for
the
peppery
flavor
experience
overall
not
bad
not
the
best
witte
ever
but
unique
and
pretty
refreshing
and
tasty
good
solid
wit
all
the
mentioned
falvors
pull
through
lemograss
adds
extra
complexity
that
is
really
enjoyable
peppercorn
doesnt
come
through
as
much
as
id
have
liked
this
beer
would
be
phenomenal
with
curry
or
any
other
thai
or
indian
food
must
try
o
drinkableenjoyable
my
favorite
dogfish
head
great
summer
beer
light
and
delicious
delicious
a
flavorful
witbier
that
somehow
makes
all
of
the
ingredients
work
you
can
even
get
a
hint
of
the
peppercorn
such
a
great
representation
of
the
style
makes
blue
moon
look
like
crap
very
carbonated
really
too
much
for
me
and
it
kind
of
consumes
most
of
your
mouth
overly
carbonated
bland
no
buy
list
overall
eh
wish
the
base
wheat
beer
was
there
but
lemongrass
and
oranges
are
interesting
average
beer
not
bad
not
great
yum
can
taste
all
of
the
ingredients
and
they
are
gooood
there
was
no
head
whatsoever
the
taste
was
great
and
the
look
was
pretty
adjunct
lageresc
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
on
this
one
good
beer
from
dogfish
head
but
not
their
best
o
pleasant
light
complex
aroma
a
very
enjoyable
session
ale
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
im
a
wit
fan
so
i
truely
enjoyed
this
with
smell
of
peppercorns
and
orange
peel
grabbing
my
sense
i
was
smiling
before
the
first
taste
which
the
taste
is
weak
according
to
some
of
my
fellow
beer
bros
i
respect
and
like
the
taste
it
is
a
simple
wit
style
with
the
light
spice
and
mellow
yeast
strain
if
you
want
a
good
wit
to
enjoy
buy
it
if
youre
looking
for
a
complex
and
a
beer
with
bursting
flavors
dont
buy
a
case
of
this
just
a
six
pack
to
expierence
it
lol
nice
smells
but
virtually
tasteless
this
was
good
very
good
will
not
seek
out
and
purchase
again
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
even
for
this
style
o
extremely
easy
to
drink
bright
and
light
on
the
tongue
a
beer
id
pick
up
on
a
summer
day
this
isnt
too
bad
i
like
the
complexity
and
the
layers
of
flavors
but
i
think
theyre
all
a
touch
too
subtle
remarks
refreshing
and
tasty
but
not
as
good
as
some
of
their
other
beers
light
refreshing
and
ultrawheaty
brew
as
far
as
witbiers
go
its
very
good
i
didnt
care
for
this
as
much
as
most
wheat
beers
it
had
a
thin
pour
a
light
taste
and
seemed
to
lack
a
bit
of
depth
the
lemongrass
was
a
bit
strong
to
me
and
i
didnt
get
as
much
orange
as
some
other
reviewers
there
also
seemed
to
be
a
bit
of
coriander
taste
present
a
decent
alternative
to
that
other
all
too
common
wit
so
pale
with
a
nice
herbaceous
flavor
lemongrass
more
apparent
on
the
nose
and
orange
in
the
flavor
pleasant
prickly
carbonation
def
drinkable
dont
get
your
hopes
up
average
at
best
if
miller
light
and
coors
light
had
a
baby
this
would
be
it
not
sure
if
the
reviews
are
biased
being
that
dogfish
head
makes
some
great
beers
and
have
a
strong
following
but
this
is
heavily
overrated

the
coriander
as
well
as
a
bread
scent
coming
through
the
taste
was
very
nice
with
a
lot
of
layers
of
flavor
coming
first
from
the
hops
and
then
the
spice
with
a
toasted
finish
made
for
a
highly
refreshing
beer
overall
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beverage
it
didnt
wow
me
over
like

it
was
still

wish
i
could
use

the

the

nicely

holds
the
flavor
well
a
really
good
white
ale
pale
almost
ashy
yellow
like
they
turned
the
saturation
down
on
the
colour
wheel
kind
of
the
colour
of
a
white
wine
barely
even
anything
of
waterybubbly
white
head
im
not
getting
much
on
the
aroma
either
almost
smells
like
a
grape
must
though
maybe
just
because
now
i
have
white
wine
on
the
mind
i
suppose
its
probably
the
subtle
lemongrass
that
im
picking
up
with
some
of
the
body
of
the
peppercorn
but
not
the
edge
again
not
getting
any
of
the
advertised
orange
but
more
a
muted
grassy
fruit
twinge
again
likely
the
lemongrass
taking
the
forefront
dont
notice
any
pepper
dash
here
and
only
a
vague
bready
note
in
the
distance
and
a
faint
belgian
yeast
at
the
finish
but
thats
about
it
some
might
describe
it
as
subtle
i
am
more
inclined
to
be
a
little
less
forgiving
and
just
say
theres
not
really
that
much
going
on
surprisingly
decent
medium
body
and
a
bit
of
a
dry
finish
i
mean
it
is
a
beautiful
sunny
afternoon
which
really
seems
to
be
the
perfect
venue
for
this
beer
though
i
feel
like
i
should
be
in
an
airy
white
tent
with
cucumber
sandwiches
nope
just
covered
in
insulation
and
watching
the
forest
subtle
notes
of
orange
and
coriander
great
on
a
crisp
day
not
heavy
or
overly
hoppy
closer
to
a
session
nice
floral
and
spiced
notes
on
the
nose
creamy
and
hazy
color
add
to
a
nice
pour
overall
really
a
miss
for
me
o
this
is
my
first
stab
at
a
dogfish
brew
and
am
quite
impressed
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
great
session
beer
if
you
can
find
it
buy
it
overall
i
was
prepared
to
be
underwhelmed
as
i
often
am
by
many
of
the
beers
in
the
dogfish
lineup
but
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
palo
santo
marron
among
my
favorites
the
perfect
summer
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
and
a
lovely
floral
aspect
very
pleasant
white
ale
with
subtle
hints
of
indian
spices
slightly
spicy
aftertaste
obvious
citrus
and
lemongrass
notes
as
advertised
on
the
bottle
i
would
consider
this
to
be
an
ideal
summer
beer
for
those
new
to
more
complex
beers
or
beers
brewed
with
spices
it
would
also
be
a
perfectly
refreshing
complement
to
very
spicy
indian
or
thai
style
food
o
nothing
overwhelming
about
this
one
just
an
easy
drinking
belgian
style
brew
light
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
has
a
light
orange
and
lemongrass
aftertaste
very
nice
taste
for
a
4
80
abv
beer
worth
trying
if
you
get
the
chance
o
ive
sadly
forgotten
how
much
i
love
witbiers
lately
and
dogfish
head
has
done
a
wonderful
job
of
providing
a
liquid
reminder
of
why
i
was
so
attracted
to
them
in
the
first
place
delicate
summerlike
flavors
infused
with
the
wonderful
touch
of
lemongrass
makes
this
a
perfect
midafternoon
beverage
i
was
however
fairly
disappointed
with
the
mouthfeel
which
is
rare
for
me
to
say
about
a
dogfish
head
offering
im
hoping
it
was
just
a
fluke
but
its
not
enough
for
me
to
shy
away
from
recommending
this
wit
to
others
a
fine
example
of
a
fine
style
overall
not
one
of
dfhs
best
attempts
but
a
solid
witbier
nonetheless
not
the
most
complex
but
it
accomplishes
what
it
strives
to
do
pours
a
very
pale
clear
gold
smallish
white
head
with
some
persistent
lacing
smell
is
lemony
orangey
citrus
also
some
of
that
great
wheat
banana
smell
taste
has
a
light
malt
sweetness
up
front
going
into
a
tangy
citrus
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
a
little
spice
but
the
wheat
remains
the
dominant
flavor
rather
full
bodied
for
a
wit
but
not
heavy
easily
drinkable
wow
what
a
great
wit
from
an
american
brewer
great
example
of
the
style
a
really
awesome
warm
weather
drinker
right
here
not
too
much
coriander
and
showing
much
more
of
the
lemongrass
and
orange
the
features
that
make
this
beer
unique
from
the
increasingly
crowded
belgian
white
category
show
up
just
a
slight
fog
to
this
otherwise
radiant
lustrous
pale
golden
brew
an
inch
of
fading
white
froth
rests
on
top
as
copious
bubbles
rise
up
from
the
bottom
of
my
wine
glass
the
nose
here
is
a
little
perfumy
overly
fragrant
maybe
but
i
definitely
pick
up
on
refreshing
lemongrass
and
citrus
clean
tasting
not
much
grain
character
to
it
which
i
guess
is
my
only
reasonable
criticism
of
this
slammable
brew
a
faint
biscuit
property
but
thats
all
a
hint
of
tartness
in
with
the
very
mild
belgian
yeast
as
it
finishes
and
again
with
a
slight
citrus
acidity
body
could
not
be
lighter
and
the
carbonation
is
as
expressive
as
any
a
really
pleasant
take
on
the
style
affordable
and
in
widely
available
sic
packs
this
is
one
i
will
buy
again
cant
think
of
a
better
hot
afternoon
beer
the
peppercorns
are
invisible
but
its
irrelevant
overall
very
nice
witbier
its
as
delicious
as
i
remembered
it
to
be
went
to
dogfish
head
brewery
to
taste
test
brought
my
growlers
along
and
this
one
got
selected
based
on
its
smooth
flavor
for
a
belgian
wit
i
loved
the
color
taste
and
smoothness
and
it
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
even
though
i
tend
to
side
on
the
ipa
hopheads
side
enjoy
o
a
very
nice
summery
brew
namaste
indeed
mouthfeel
is
light
full
of
carbonation
and
dry
the
carbonation
is
very
high
as
expected
and
this
is
right
where
it
should
be
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
works
great
on
a
hot
day
nothing
blows
me
away
and
it
is
fairly
conservative
namaste
namaste
to
thee
with
a
low
25
ibu
this
brew
has
a
high
degree
of
drinkability
especially
for
the
hopconfused
demographic
flavors
for
this
brew
are
layered
nicely
nothing
too
over
powering
very
bright
finish
leaving
the
palate
feeling
clean
great
thirst
quencher
o
this
is
not
my
cup
of
tea
at
all
but
i
think
it
succeeds
for
what
it
tries
to
be
sessionable
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
o
this
is
reminiscent
of
sunscreen
but
in
a
good
way
it
tastes
like
summer
nice
and
light
would
be
refreshing
on
the
beach
good
thing
this
is
in
six
packs
now
overall
i
might
be
a
little
harsh
on
this
beer
because
its
far
outside
of
the
kind
i
normally
like
to
drink
the
taste
is
not
very
complex
and
there
isnt
a
really
any
hops
or
malt
taste
it
doesnt
feel
very
balanced
to
me
just
a
bit
spicy
overall
dont
miss
this
one
the
delicate
but
persistent
features
of
a
weiss
with
the
smooth
drinkability
of
a
lager
dogfish
reminds
us
again
why
its
a
powerhouse
among
the
craft
breweries
o
well
its
pretty
interesting
i
dont
know
if
its
the
pepper
or
not
but
the
taste
is
definitely
different
from
your
typical
wit
the
only
problem
is
im
not
sure
i
really
like
it
i
dont
mind
some
bitterness
but
it
seems
misplaced
here
it
was
interesting
to
try
but
i
doubt
ill
be
revisiting
it
anytime
soon
traditional
hefeweizen
flavorsplenty
of
wheat
and
yeast
theres
a
soft
malt
to
the
beginning
which
slowly
shifts
to
sweetish
wheat
slight
sourness
in
the
swallow
short
aftertaste
full
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
but
there
are
better
wits
out
there
oa
witbier
that
isnt
overly
sweet
which
is
a
plus
in
my
book
i
thought
the
nose
was
more
dynamic
than
the
flavor
but
as
far
as
the
style
goes
its
a
solid
brew
o
a
good
belgian
beer
and
summer
ale
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
to
try
a
belgian
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
oexcellent
beer
will
def
have
again
look
is
not
impressive
but
taste
is
highly
recommended
appearance
is
a
cloudy
light
straw
with
a
finger
of
head
that
quickly
dissipated
down
to
a
thin
film
the
nose
had
the
essence
of
wheat
and
a
pinch
of
belgian
funk
the
flavor
is
light
and
mild
with
the
wheat
upfront
and
a
finish
that
is
dry
and
slightly
peppery
overall
this
is
another
well
crafted
beer
from
dfh
tasty
and
sessionable
overall
this
is
a
decent
lightly
spiced
wheat
beer
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
if
the
spices
were
a
bit
more
prominent
this
would
be
an
even
better
beer
overall
a
very
good
take
on
a
belgian
style
witbier
good
notes
of
citrus
and
coriander
o
a
crisp
refreshing
white
brew
with
extra
bits
other
flavours
to
keep
you
interested
i
like
this
beer
like
the
taste
just
cant
seem
to
put
into
words
why
although
i
only
bought
one
bottle
of
this
i
could
have
easily
had
3
or
4
in
a
sitting
since
the
alcohol
was
both
undetectable
and
low
in
terms
of
percentage
while
not
as
good
as
its
european
counterparts
theres
a
lot
to
like
here
and
for
a
beer
this
unassuming
there
was
enough
flavor
to
satisfy
even
the
biggest
beer
geek
a
hint
of
wheat
or
more
spice
would
have
been
appreciated
but
as
it
was
this
was
something
that
id
reach
for
again
now
that
the
warmer
months
are
here
another
subtly
solid
offering
from
dogfish
head
this
beer
is
crisp
and
nicely
carbonated
with
a
good
flavor
overall
for
its
style
the
spice
is
good
but
not
overdone
and
the
fruits
yeast
and
wheat
each
contributes
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
beer
in
their
own
way
i
liked
it
more
as
i
sipped
more
and
ended
by
bottle
wishing
i
had
another
im
not
always
in
the
mood
for
witbier
but
when
i
am
i
will
keep
this
dogfish
brew
in
mind
taste
is
light
and
appropriately
approachable
theres
a
wellbalanced
spice
character
that
plays
well
alongside
a
refreshing
citrus
tone
nothing
here
is
overthetop
or
experimental
as
most
of
dogfish
brews
are
light
and
refreshing
this
ones
solid
and
enjoyable
nonetheless
its
creamy
fluffy
and
soft
on
the
tongue
all
the
way
but
keeps
up
a
firm
crispness
the
body
is
light
and
carries
everything
well
it
heads
a
little
dry
into
the
finish
but
never
dries
out
too
much
everything
about
this
beer
is
goodtogreat
except
a
major
butterscotch
hit
of
diacetyl
its
distracting
and
disappointing
the
beer
is
fresh
as
well
so
there
are
no
excuses
here
o
this
was
the
style
that
really
catapulted
me
into
my
beer
craze
back
in
the
day
i
hardly
ever
buy
it
anymore
but
my
desire
to
try
as
many
df
head
beers
as
possible
won
out
it
was
a
really
nice
surprise
to
have
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
i
did
i
can
definitely
see
buying
this
for
times
im
craving
something
light
or
for
lazy
days
by
the
lake
probably
the
best
whit
ive
tried
so
far
the
only
other
thing
i
have
to
add
is
that
the
price
was
ridiculous
i
dont
know
if
it
was
just
the
store
that
i
go
to
but
i
paid
almost
16
for
a
sixer
pretty
hefty
for
a
low
abv
beer
beerandwhiskeyhq
com
im
a
big
fan
of
dogfish
head
beers
and
i
guess
i
was
just
expecting
more
out
of
this
brew
it
was
a
bit
on
the
boring
and
plain
side
the
white
wheat
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
floral
nose
and
very
light
citrusy
flavor
im
not
a
huge
fan
and
it
just
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
mold
of
normal
dogfish
head
brews
overall
overall
this
beer
was
very
surprising
definitely
not
a
session
drinking
beer
despite
its
moderately
low
abv
4
8
its
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
its
not
too
overbearing
but
compared
to
most
white
beers
its
just
different
however
different
isnt
always
bad
as
a
pleasant
surprise
the
herbal
esters
of
this
beer
definitely
sneak
up
on
you
they
are
barely
detectable
in
the
aromas
but
this
adds
to
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
a
welcome
if
not
unusual
surprise
from
dogfish
head
not
necessarily
a
brew
that
id
keep
stock
of
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
bottle
or
two
again
to
have
some
variety
o
as
always
dogfish
head
cannot
miss
good
abv
good
flavors
with
a
little
twist
on
the
wit
worth
looking
for
ooverall
a
great
wit
beer
need
to
get
some
for
the
summer
highly
drinkable
flavorful
sessionable
beer
aromas
are
highly
herbal
with
the
coriander
almost
to
the
point
of
being
perfumey
yeast
characters
emerge
as
it
warms
hints
of
banana
taste
is
bright
citrusy
spicy
and
grainy
its
a
load
of
flavor
in
a
small
beer
had
out
of
a
pilsner
at
about
45
degrees
a
fan
o
while
its
funny
that
this
was
once
one
of
my
favorites
i
still
love
this
beer
as
i
sip
i
await
the
break
of
summer
the
irony
rests
in
a
snowstorm
outside
my
front
door
drinkability
is
both
light
and
easy
drinking
and
thickandchewy
like
a
good
witbier
should
be
this
is
another
fine
brew
from
dfh
looks
like
a
wit
smells
like
a
wit
tastes
like
a
wit
real
nice
citrus
tones
showing
through
with
those
peppercorns
ending
up
on
the
backside
easy
to
drink
there
are
some
thicker
yeast
tones
with
a
bready
edge
on
the
backside
that
probably
interfere
with
those
characteristics
but
the
beer
overall
is
pretty
nice
this
is
a
very
true
to
style
brew
i
think
its
a
very
wise
idea
that
they
put
this
in
12
ouncers
is
light
goldenstraw
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
good
retention
and
a
nice
lace
aroma
is
of
tart
fruit
and
candy
body
is
crisp
and
carbonated
taste
is
of
spicy
lemon
and
sweet
tart
candy
fresh
and
tart
at
the
finish
very
nice
example
of
this
style
will
be
a
regular
this
summer
if
summer
ever
gets
here
overall
a
pretty
nice
brew
not
overly
complex
but
it
paired
well
with
dinner
and
also
seems
decently
sessionable
its
very
well
balanced
would
have
again
another
nice
beer
from
dfh
overall
a
tasty
and
refreshing
complex
witbier
a
light
dry
and
slightly
tart
beer
that
packs
in
a
good
deal
of
character
off
the
nose
its
this
beer
shows
its
colors
as
a
belgium
witt
with
coriander
peppercorn
a
mellow
but
all
too
apparent
spiciness
and
some
grassier
these
flavors
carry
into
the
palate
where
the
more
vegetal
flavors
of
the
bunch
stand
out
thats
not
to
say
its
not
followed
by
hints
of
orange
lemongrass
and
dried
flowers
overall
this
beer
manages
to
present
itself
in
such
a
pleasant
manner
the
entire
way
through
to
the
finish
give
me
a
good
wit
and
let
me
dump
a
lemon
slice
in
my
self
personally
i
like
this
beer
but
like
most
wits
tripels
to
much
coriander
spices
clear
straw
colored
with
an
orangey
white
thin
head
that
settles
out
quickly
aroma
of
yeast
and
clove
flavor
initially
fairly
matches
the
nose
but
slight
lemony
notes
emerge
and
a
peppery
bite
works
its
way
into
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
but
a
bit
talcy
as
well
o
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
really
made
me
say
wow
but
there
was
nothing
to
dislike
about
it
at
all
definitely
something
which
can
be
drunk
in
multiples
with
hanging
with
friends
o
a
bit
of
a
different
take
this
works
pretty
well
o
if
it
wasnt
for
that
bitterness
which
im
attributing
to
the
dried
orange
slices
i
would
really
like
this
wheat
beer
i
think
its
worth
revisiting
on
a
hot
summer
day
with
a
barbecue
meal
it
would
probably
be
very
refreshing
not
a
favorite
for
drinking
on
its
own
though
overall
not
bad
but
would
be
much
better
if
the
fruits
were
more
upfront
with
less
peppercorn
the
more
i
drink
it
the
less
im
enjoying
it
decent
enough
for
a
hot
summer
day
for
some
low
alcohol
but
i
look
for
crisp
fruity
wits
that
feature
orange
melons
or
berries
worth
a
drink
for
fans
of
wit
that
want
a
little
twist
on
the
style
this
could
be
a
special
beer
imo
with
a
kick
of
fruits
though
good
beer
solid
throughout
orange
and
coriander
from
first
sip
through
to
the
end
overall
i
agree
with
most
its
a
very
well
crafted
white
ale
with
mild
spices
and
some
interesting
lemongrass
tones
but
compared
to
most
witbier
beers
its
really
mild
and
somewhat
lacking
flavor
i
cant
believe
they
finally
put
it
in
six
packs
making
this
worth
10
dollars
a
six
pack
it
was
no
way
worth
89
dollars
a
bomber
very
pleasant
the
look
in
a
glass
reminds
me
a
lot
of
a
lighter
american
hefeweizen
pale
yellow
in
color
and
not
much
head
not
that
i
was
expecting
much
for
a
white
beer
you
can
pick
up
on
the
orange
scent
better
from
the
bottle
and
out
of
a
glass
it
smell
more
like
a
traditional
white
beer
but
the
taste
comes
out
nicely
for
this
particular
type
of
beer
it
was
unique
for
what
i
have
had
in
white
beers
but
it
wasnt
astounding
light
taste
easy
to
drink
almost
fruity
with
a
crisp
after
taste
that
lasts
long
enough
to
enjoy
but
doesnt
stick
around
too
long
i
think
this
beer
is
really
a
nice
refreshing
sweet
drink
and
like
its
name
is
meant
to
be
satisfying
and
harmonious
overall
its
a
decent
sessionable
beer
but
as
far
as
the
exact
style
i
much
prefer
ufo
more
citrus
character
than
i
recall
refreshing
clean
beer
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
hint
of
sunshine
in
it
hazed
and
with
a
white
head
of
loose
bubbles
that
fell
quickly
to
a
ring
and
film
on
top
just
lovely
nose
is
breaddy
and
cracker
there
is
a
light
grain
sweetness
that
seems
to
be
deep
in
the
beer
but
not
too
strong
or
heavy
the
fruit
is
subtle
a
bit
of
lemon
citrus
a
very
faint
whisper
of
fresh
orange
some
coriander
adds
earth
to
the
nose
taste
is
friendly
and
very
drinkable
dry
crisp
and
the
flavor
of
lemongrass
the
juicy
orange
lightly
underneath
and
a
crisp
wheat
dryness
creamy
body
with
active
carbonation
a
bit
of
earth
finishes
this
one
dry
overall
wheat
beers
are
far
from
my
goto
style
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
considering
that
its
a
very
refreshing
sessionable
beer
that
i
would
imagine
would
be
great
in
the
summertime
instead
of
the
blizzardlike
conditions
im
actually
drinking
it
in
interesting
twist
on
a
witbier
very
sessionable
id
buy
it
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
something
different
i
tasted
it
and
this
is
where
i
start
to
get
dissappointed
dogfishhead
has
a
lot
of
original
tasting
beers
whereas
this
one
tastes
like
heineken
and
a
lot
of
other
beers
of
the
sort
the
only
distinction
is
the
heavy
after
taste
of
lemongrass
which
is
why
i
give
taste
a
3
75
heineken
is
about
a
2
25
for
me
but
this
aftertaste
in
namaste
is
incredible
im
not
going
to
get
more
any
time
soon
the
alcohol
content
is
only
5
and
it
was
i
think
12
for
a
pint
worth
to
buy
it
if
you
want
to
know
what
good
heineken
tastes
like
but
its
nothing
special
this
tastes
refreshing
and
creamy
with
a
light
zesty
tang
of
lemon
and
coriander
flavorful
again
because
of
the
corn
the
lemon
and
peppercorn
for
me
imparts
a
tangy
corn
aspect
that
defines
this
beer
it
drinks
well
and
for
how
light
it
is
quite
rich
in
flavor
light
peppery
and
well
balanced
with
a
perfectly
refreshing
lemon
lighter
orangeflavored
finish
although
highly
drinkable
it
feels
less
carbonated
after
a
fairly
short
while
i
tried
this
one
a
couple
years
back
from
a
750
ml
bottle
and
loved
it
even
though
i
thought
it
was
overpriced
glad
to
see
the
6
packs
could
be
a
summer
session
choice
a
light
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
whiteishgolden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
musty
wheat
a
bit
of
spice
taste
is
spices
some
citrus
and
wheat
very
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
would
probably
be
more
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
a
solid
beer
poured
into
a
trusty
pint
glass
a
nice
clean
crisp
light
color
with
small
head
you
can
taste
the
orange
peel
and
peppercorn
taste
is
about
average
at
best
a
mouthful
starting
taste
that
dwindeles
as
the
more
you
drink
overall
a
decent
average
white
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
worth
trying
at
least
once
overall
this
was
a
nice
witbier
but
i
was
disappointed
that
i
didnt
get
much
citrusorange
i
love
the
idea
of
this
beer
but
the
flavored
werent
very
pronounced
even
still
a
refreshing
wheat
this
is
a
very
solid
witbier
i
just
wish
the
flavors
popped
just
a
bit
more
but
its
all
good
i
really
like
this
for
what
it
is
i
really
appreciated
the
subtle
flavors
the
more
i
drank
it
its
enjoyable
and
would
hit
the
spot
in
the
summer
o
just
kind
of
lacks
character
flat
nothing
special
wow
superb
cant
wait
to
guzzle
down
sixers
of
these
come
summer
creamy
and
birstly
mouthfeel
dry
grainy
husk
flavor
throughout
sharp
wheat
some
tart
citrus
flavors
with
a
bit
of
grassyness
and
a
super
dry
grainy
finish
with
hearty
wheat
bread
flavors
lingering
in
the
mouth
a
touch
of
pucker
a
lot
of
flavor
and
intensely
refreshing
overall
another
good
one
from
dogfish
head
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
nice
flavorful
refreshing
witbier
that
you
can
sit
back
and
drink
a
few
of
without
giving
it
much
thought
the
transition
from
750s
to
12oz
4
packs
is
a
nice
change
too
o
i
usually
never
have
a
strong
opinion
on
most
of
the
dfh
regulars
good
or
bad
and
guess
what
this
is
another
dfh
regular
thats
only
okay
to
me
i
would
have
felt
royally
gypped
paying
10
for
a
750
of
this
so
thanks
to
its
6pack
availability
i
can
merely
give
it
a
nonchalant
shrug
overall
not
exactly
up
to
par
with
other
dfh
offerings
i
am
going
to
avoid
this
one
in
the
future
this
is
a
very
nice
light
brew
there
is
a
ton
of
flavor
for
how
light
it
is
it
goes
down
quite
easy
overall
a
very
good
beer
especially
if
you
like
your
witbier
with
a
lot
of
citruslemon
dogfish
head
namaste
45
i
found
this
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
and
being
that
it
was
very
hot
on
the
porch
this
made
for
a
good
summer
cooler
overall
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
again
and
not
dogfish
heads
best
but
makes
a
good
summer
drink
and
still
drinks
nicely
and
satisfies
again
its
possible
i
got
a
bad
sample
but
i
live
in
delaware
and
bought
this
at
a
decent
store
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
it
in
more
expensive
bomber
format
or
i
would
have
been
really
disappointed
my
assessment
is
that
theres
a
great
deal
more
happening
on
the
label
of
this
bottle
than
with
the
brew
under
it
this
is
a
fairly
drab
wit
and
without
enhancement
from
food
the
subcontinental
spices
lay
largely
dormant
it
does
drink
easily
with
spicy
food
though
so
i
could
be
convinced
to
have
this
meek
creature
again
with
thai
or
afghani
fare
down
the
line
o
all
smell
and
no
taste
not
high
on
the
priority
list
to
try
again
a
beer
that
seems
mildly
interesting
with
first
gulp
but
as
you
pay
attention
to
the
smell
and
continue
to
feel
it
in
your
mouth
it
becomes
less
appealing
pours
hazy
dark
white
light
foam
wheat
nose
and
a
mix
of
spices
corriander
for
sure
quite
prominent
citrussy
on
the
lighter
side
but
different
flavors
blend
in
a
good
light
summer
beer
not
remarkable
well
executed
witbier
not
that
flavorful
but
with
high
drinkability
and
nice
on
a
hot
day
such
this
one
i
believe
it
would
be
more
interesting
if
the
lemongrass
note
could
be
tune
up
just
a
bit
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
ample
effervescence
apparent
the
aroma
offers
malt
lemons
lemon
zest
earthy
hop
scents
grass
refreshing
and
light
immediately
i
think
the
body
is
too
thin
though
on
the
other
hand
this
adds
to
the
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
day
factor
still
id
prefer
a
slightly
more
robust
feel
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
floral
hops
and
lemon
grass
with
a
dash
of
citrus
particularly
lemons
and
oranges
respectively
overall
a
solid
beer
but
overpriced
8
99
per
sixer
might
inspire
me
to
purchase
this
again
but
for
a
750
ml
bottle
thats
asking
too
much
given
the
style
o
good
lemon
flavor
without
being
too
sweet
o
for
the
summertime
a
brew
worth
looking
into
light
enough
for
the
season
and
perfect
for
a
wide
range
of
beer
enthusiasts
a
great
witbier
hadnt
had
in
many
years
still
satisfies
have
to
revisit
another
of
my
old
favorites
again
soon
i
am
pretty
happy
i
got
this
for
my
birthday
as
i
did
like
it
it
came
nowhere
close
to
wowing
me
but
sometimes
that
is
okay
at
the
price
point
i
am
pretty
sure
i
wont
purchase
another
but
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
gorgeous
packaging
but
that
is
dogfish
head
for
you
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
nice
golden
hue
with
a
bubbly
thin
white
head
that
had
no
cling
large
amounts
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
a
bit
of
wheat
mellowed
nicely
by
orange
citrus
taste
was
clean
a
bit
of
citrus
up
front
became
herbal
in
the
middle
with
a
bit
of
hoppy
grain
in
the
backend
coated
nicely
seemed
a
tad
thin
but
not
bad
overall
not
bad
well
balanced
flavor
with
a
nice
twist
lacks
flavor
but
makes
it
up
as
one
of
the
most
addictive
beers
i
have
had
maybe
thats
a
bad
thing
though
it
lacks
complexities
from
the
german
and
belgian
wheat
beers
it
tastes
almost
like
watered
down
lemon
drink
at
times
overall
refreshing
and
drinkable
perhaps
a
nice
warmer
seasonal
but
there
are
far
better
and
more
enjoyable
wit
biers
out
there
at
a
far
better
price
disappointed
light
yellow
color
slightly
cloudy
with
a
ton
of
white
head
smells
sour
lemony
the
taste
is
tart
and
flowery
namaste
is
sweeter
than
the
smell
leads
on
but
i
almost
wish
it
was
even
sweeter
than
it
is
there
are
some
really
nice
flavors
at
work
here
over
all
this
beer
is
light
and
very
drinkable
and
the
bottle
conditioning
helps
with
the
smoothness
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
have
on
hand
when
the
weather
warms
up
overall
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
tried
this
beer
and
i
intend
to
seek
it
out
again
a
great
example
of
an
american
wit
perhaps
one
of
the
most
traditional
beers
ive
had
from
dfh
the
packaging
was
better
than
the
beer
web
site
is
pretty
cool
too
we
will
be
trying
other
beers
from
this
brewery
pleasant
enough
nothing
bold
here
a
seemingly
average
ale
we
paired
it
with
dinner
thai
chicken
peanut
salad
a
good
compliment
flavors
then
melded
nicely

abv
medium
bodied
with
the
carbonation
sharp
up
front
but
it
settles
quickly
if
you
can
get
past
the
artificial
lemon
presence
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
its
not
easy
tasty
and
interesting
but
not
really
a
daily
or
monthly
drinker
for
me
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
light
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
has
lots
of
flavor
but
to
me
seems
as
if
the
beer
is
discombobulated
in
taste
flavors
are
here
and
there
lacking
uniformity
solid
beer
nonetheless
review
from
notes
i
liked
it
good
example
of
the
style
cheers
o
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
witbier
good
flavors
and
fairly
true
to
style
dfh
rarely
disappoints
and
this
beer
is
a
winner
strong
smell
of
lemonorange
mouth
feel
was
a
bit
too
carbonated
but
taste
of
the
lemongrass
and
orange
peel
were
definitely
present
and
added
some
interesting
flavor
a
little
too
yeasty
also
but
overall
i
enjoyed
this
not
typically
a
fan
of
this
style
but
a
very
intriguing
offer
from
dogfish
wouldnt
buy
the
bottle
again
but
would
have
it
if
it
was
on
tap
somewhere
overall
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
o
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
from
dogfish
head
and
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
during
the
summer
easy
to
drink
low
alcohol
and
very
tasty

this
is
what
i
expect
in
a
witbier
but
nothing
outstanding
to
mention
it
has
good
balanced
aroma
and
nice
smooth
finish
a
very
drinkable
brew
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
jd
overall
it
was
pretty
good
but
nothing
too
exceptional
and
not
really
something
of
only
big
bottle
format
good
beer
soft
breezy
and
beautiful
mmmmm
nice
namaste
overall
i
liked
this
beer
and
i
thought
that
it
was
a
good
and
true
example
of
the
style
it
pretty
much
had
everything
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
so
i
wasnt
left
wanting
more
everyone
i
shared
it
with
liked
it
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
really
smooth
and
refreshing
i
could
see
myself
having
no
problem
drinking
the
whole
bottle
a
great
choice
for
a
warm
summer
afternoon
what
i
liked
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
and
complex
it
was
it
wasnt
overdone
by
any
means
and
it
had
great
balance
what
i
liked
least
about
this
beer
is
that
dogfish
head
doesnt
put
this
in
12oz
bottles
it
seems
like
the
perfect
beer
for
that
format
almost
10
dollars
for
750ml
of
a
5
witbier
isnt
a
great
deal
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
maybe
for
a
special
occasion
but
for
the
price
i
couldnt
justify
buying
it
often
all
in
all
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
odd
and
different
with
this
beer
instead
i
just
got
a
really
good
tasting
witbier
and
thats
just
what
i
needed
good
work
guys
this
is
one
solid
and
good
tasting
witbier
o
one
of
the
most
sessionable
witbiers
ive
had
taste
is
subtle
and
delicate
but
enjoyable
just
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
decent
brew
o
i
would
not
say
this
is
my
favorite
of
this
style
and
would
not
buy
a
bottle
of
this
again
its
not
bad
i
just
dont
think
its
worth
the
dough
fairly
light
bodied
with
medium
slightlyspritzy
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
did
like
the
uber
carbonation
in
this
one
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
texas
night
its
quite
possible
that
this
style
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
similar
to
a
hefe
but
felt
just
a
bit
off
overall
o
nice
it
had
some
interesting
flavors
to
it
all
of
them
were
a
little
too
mild
and
not
much
really
stuck
with
me
overall
for
a
style
that
is
usually
bland
and
boring
this
one
stands
out
as
one
of
the
best
it
was
crisp
and
light
but
unlike
some
witbiers
the
spices
werent
overwhelming
unfortunately
beyond
that
it
seemed
to
be
a
typical
witbier
with
nothing
in
particular
standing
out
perhaps
its
a
bit
above
average
though
as
i
did
find
it
more
drinkable
than
a
few
ive
had
recently
i
wouldnt
pay
the
usual
8
dollars
for
a
750ml
of
this
ever
but
it
wasnt
wasted
money
especially
with
that
coupon
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
goblet
cant
read
the
bottled
date
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
light
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
of
corriander
orange
and
spices
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
okay
a
little
orange
and
ripe
orange
bitterness
some
lemon
grass
pretty
light
flavors
for
dogfish
head
not
their
best
this
was
a
textbook
witbier
in
my
opinion
i
would
say
that
flying
dogs
woody
creek
is
probably
a
good
comparison
here
ive
had
others
that
were
very
similar
but
the
level
of
quality
is
probably
what
sets
this
beer
apart
from
the
others
plus
it
was
fresh
from
the
brewpub
750

that

some

this

a
quite
original

this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
light
refreshing
and
easy
to

overall
its
pretty
anemic
though
inoffensive
in
flavor
whats
offensive
is
the
price
of
a

o
definitely
overpriced
for
a
witbier
but
its
good
stuff

an
overpowering

theres
a

something
beerlike
maybe
wheat
its
light

velvety
smooth

its
lightly

its
sort

theres
not
really
any
bitterness
to
speak
of
its
perhaps
a
touch
sweet
there
isnt

aftertaste
i
feel
like
i
would
enjoy
this
much
more
if
i
was
sipping
it
outside
in
some
hot
weather
its
really
mellow
and
incredibly
inoffensive

ma
balanced
dry
and
refreshing
and
still
packs
a
good
deal
of
flavor
overall
this
was
really
an
average
beer
a
good
session
drink
and
a
good
summer
lawn
moweryardwork
beer
i
dont
see
a
reason
why
they
would
put
this
in
a
bomber
and
not
just
sell
it
by
the
six
pack
very
average
flavors
and
smells
but
at
least
it
looked
nice
i
think
maybe
there
was
a
problem
with
this
bottle
being
over
carbonated
that
took
a
bit
away
from
everything
o
this
was
a
great
wheatbeer
im
usually
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
i
couldnt
definitely
see
my
self
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
were
in
6packs
i
liked
how
it
a
good
balance
between
the
orange
lemon
sweet
and
bitter
tastes
this
would
definitely
make
a
great
beer
to
have
on
hot
summer
days
i
would
definitely
recommend
trying
some
the
cloudy
creamy
color
frothy
lasting
head
and
fresh
citrus
cues
are
there
its
soothing
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
spring
day
however
this
one
does
not
stand
out
from
the
style
in
any
way
for
me
o
very
tasty
almost
no
hop
bitterness
to
ruin
the
lightness
of
the
wit
profile
but
the
hops
add
some
nice
fruitiness
to
the
profile
pour
is
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
tight
white
head
the
nose
is
bright
and
balanced
an
assertive
yeast
not
with
a
well
balanced
peppery
spice
the
coriander
adds
an
interesting
earthy
note
behind
the
taste
is
also
bright
lemony
zest
lightly
earthy
assertive
yeast
notes
with
a
solid
balance
of
spice
and
coriander
the
body
is
light
and
airy
strong
carbonation
and
a
semi
dry
finish
o
i
enjoyed
this
im
a
big
fan
of
witbier
and
this
doesnt
disappoint
if
your
used
to
the
more
mainstream
witbier
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
a
spring
or
summer
night
on
the
deck
with
friends
o
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
witbier
however
id
rather
see
it
in
a
12oz
format
sampled
on
april
7
2012
at
the
keene
nh
beerfest
the
pour
was
pale
yellow
to
olive
in
tone
with
a
fizzy
white
head
and
a
generally
cloudy
appearance
the
aroma
features
an
array
of
sensations
including
citrus
grainy
malts
yeast
and
something
not
unlike
wheat
the
body
is
about
medium
and
fairly
typical
for
the
style
the
taste
had
a
slightly
more
bready
flavor
along
with
malts
pepper
and
a
dry
finish
this
one
costs
a
few
bucks
so
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
at
a
brewfest
dogfish
head
namaste
witbier
22oz
bomber
witbiers
have
been
one
of
my
favorites
ever
since
i
had
a
hoggarten
on
the
grand
place
in
brussels
aside
from
the
ubiquitous
coors
blue
moon
you
do
not
see
many
brewers
pursuing
this
fine
style
of
beer
dogfish
head
has
a
good
reputation
so
despite
the
ugly
label
i
picked
up
this
bomber
to
see
what
dogfish
head
could
do
the
thin
pure
white
head
sits
atop
a
cloudy
straw
colored
body
and
effuses
an
aroma
of
citrus
good
witbier
flavor
which
stays
very
light
no
aftertaste
the
namaste
is
a
good
effort
by
dogfish
head
and
worthy
of
a
try
i
drink
wheats
and
whites
during
the
summer
and
often
more
than
one
per
sitting
often
with
fresh
for
zest
or
aged
for
sweetness
lemon
a
statement
white
beer
just
does
not
fit
into
the
economics
and
it
is
often
the
lemon
that
is
more
key
to
the
flavor
than
the
underlying
brew
so
blue
moon
will
remain
the
staple
overall
a
good
brew
from
dfh
but
a
little
bit
highly
priced
10750ml
highly
drinkable
perfect
for
summer
days
pours
a
pale
whitestraw
color
a
careful
pour
still
yields
a
decent
amount
of
sediment
aromas
of
hay
citrus
grass
and
wheat
are
dominant
in
the
taste
much
like
a
standard
wit
wheat
lemon
twang
of
lemon
grass
citrus
coriander
and
pepper
very
light
the
mouthfeel
is
extrememly
light
bodied
thin
and
watery
overall
interesting
and
glad
to
try
would
say
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
found
it
a
bit
too
over
spiced
to
be
quenching
and
too
watery
to
hold
the
spices
at
bay
average
o
this
is
a
really
good
witbier
i
love
the
spice
and
lemonorange
balance
definitely
a
beer
that
ill
be
getting
again
22
ounce
bomber
its
about
75
degrees
and
sunny
outside
so
to
celebrate
that
spring
has
sprung
im
digging
a
rarity
from
dogfish
out
of
the
back
of
the
fridge
namaste
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
nice
pillowy
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
lots
of
little
floaties
remain
in
my
glass
not
sure
if
thats
yeast
spice
or
something
else
rustic
is
probably
the
best
and
kindest
way
to
describe
the
appearance
has
the
hallmark
smell
of
a
classic
witbier
with
notes
of
coriander
and
light
citrusy
orange
peel
the
first
things
i
pick
up
in
the
nose
im
also
getting
a
lemon
character
which
i
can
only
assume
is
the
lemongrass
first
taste
is
quite
nice
as
the
beer
has
a
certain
thirst
quenching
impact
in
that
it
hits
the
tongue
and
quickly
washes
to
the
sides
of
the
mouth
and
down
the
throat
almost
too
fast
musky
wheat
malt
holds
up
the
structure
of
the
beer
from
the
onset
before
its
washed
away
by
a
cavalcade
of
spice
and
citrus
yeast
lends
a
slightly
tart
almost
sour
note
in
a
supporting
role
the
after
finish
is
pleasant
lemon
pith
the
beer
finishes
dry
with
a
hint
of
spicy
carbonation
which
leaves
you
wanting
to
go
back
to
it
and
drink
some
more
wits
can
often
be
heavy
handed
in
the
spice
department
though
that
is
not
the
case
with
namaste
which
arrives
at
a
nearly
perfect
balance
between
the
signature
spices
and
the
wheat
and
hops
behind
them
kudos
to
the
brewer
though
the
lengthy
cellaring
time
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
as
well
despite
the
somewhat
awkward
appearance
at
the
beginning
the
beer
is
actually
quite
good
and
certainly
hits
the
spot
on
a
warm
spring
day
o
a
very
tasty
sessionable
beer
with
a
good
scent
nothing
much
to
complain
about
other
than
the
particles
that
caught
me
off
guard
at
822oz
bottle
i
probably
couldnt
afford
to
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
but
its
definitely
good
o
i
can
describe
this
best
as
a
disappointment
its
presented
in
the
special
22
oz
bottle
and
with
decent
packaging
the
perceived
concept
something
special
was
certainly
underwhelmed
by
utter
absence
of
flavor
o
well
its
a
refreshing
wheat
beer
perfect
for
a
warm
day
its
the
basic
characteristic
taste
youre
looking
for
so
it
makes
the
cut
but
it
isnt
particularly
notable
it
was
slightly
more
bitter
than
im
used
to
i
cant
tell
if
that
was
a
welcome
twist
or
a
distraction
but
im
ok
with
it
bombers
are
often
ripoffs
and
this
one
is
no
exception
its
definitely
not
good
enough
to
justify
the
10
i
paid
on
a
costperounce
basis
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
would
be
over
28
which
is
triple
what
its
worth
fffuuu
bombers
overalldrinkability
okay
nicely
spiced
for
a
wit
but
not
the
most
drinkable
wit
ive
ever
had
went
well
with
crab
cakes
and
i
would
have
loved
a
larger
glass
but
i
would
have
stopped
at
one
lack
of
aroma
disappointing
though
using
coriander
in
a
witbier
seems
very
risky
seeing
that
witbier
naturally
have
a
skunky
bite
to
them
adding
a
spice
that
has
little
subtly
would
make
for
a
unique
tasting
but
not
a
good
drink
but
the
mellow
undertones
of
all
the
flavors
mold
well
if
this
beer
was
any
stronger
or
robust
i
do
not
think
it
would
work
great
for
food
pairing
cheese
fruit
and
vegetables
this
is
a
very
tasty
well
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
pilsner
with
spices
added
easily
consumable
and
thirst
quenching
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
a
muggy
day
o
nothing
special
nothing
wowing
just
an
alright
beer
strange
for
dfh
not
adding
their
own
flair
to
this
a
nice
fresh
witbier
with
an
orange
flavor
no
need
for
an
orange
wedge
though
thats
not
my
thing
anyway
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
though
pricey
for
what
it
is
o
not
a
bad
tasting
beer
just
nothing
special
dogfish
should
stick
to
the
extreme
brews
imo
o
very
typical
of
a
belgian
white
beer
really
its
a
good
beer
but
i
think
you
can
do
as
well
without
spending
10
a
bottle
i
think
many
of
the
american
imitations
in
the
belgian
white
style
fall
short
of
greatness
several
brand
names
come
to
mind
ehhem
blue
moon
that
are
just
mediocre
representations
of
really
great
styles
the
dogfish
head
namaste
doesnt
fall
into
that
category
refreshing
and
smooth
yet
fairly
full
and
complex
this
is
one
of
the
best
american
imitations
ive
seen
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
i
would
probably
pass
on
this
one
if
i
had
to
pay
for
it
again
but
if
it
was
on
someone
else
dime
would
like
to
try
it
again
serving
type
bottle
o
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
unique
belgianstyle
witbier
that
is
likely
better
from
the
bottle
than
the
tap
had
this
not
been
so
watery
i
would
have
had
no
trouble
giving
it
a
much
higher
review
so
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
all
of
the
flavors
they
say
are
in
there
orange
slices
fresh
cut
lemongrass
and
coriander
are
indeed
there
and
in
just
the
right
amount
for
each
it
was
very
good
from
first
sip
to
last
sip
and
overall
loved
the
taste
and
want
more
overall
it
is
definitely
not
a
traditional
wit
but
this
is
what
you
would
expect
with
dogfish
it
is
a
good
beer
just
remember
that
you
need
to
clear
all
preconceived
notions
out
of
you
head
before
trying
it
oreall
great
beer
by
dogfish
head
my
girlfriend
even
likes
it
and
shes
not
a
beer
person
overall
ok
beer
not
for
every
day
overall
i
am
thoroughly
enjoying
this
beer
it
wasnt
cheap
but
id
happily
buy
it
again
its
a
nice
white
that
is
easy
to
drink
o
very
good
beer
but
with
dfh
pricing
not
one
i
would
drink
a
lot
o
probably
my
favorite
in
the
style
although
dogfish
does
some
outrageous
things
with
their
beers
this
one
is
pretty
much
by
the
book
they
really
do
the
style
justice
while
still
putting
their
off
centered
spin
on
it
to
remind
you
that
its
dfh
this
gets
my
highest
recommendation
and
comes
at
a
reasonable
price
grab
one
o
the
subtle
herbal
qualities
of
lemon
orange
and
lemongrass
have
a
nice
bready
support
with
little
yeast
characteristic
and
just
a
touch
of
spice
note
but
that
is
fine
it
paired
well
with
a
mild
fontina
overall
very
good
session
beer
keeps
you
coming
back
for
the
bitterness
not
huge
complexity
with
a
bunch
of
strange
and
unique
flavors
that
i
didnt
really
harmonize
all
that
well
but
interesting
for
sure
perhaps
im
drinking
this
a
bit
past
its
season
but
its
still
very
refreshing
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
poured
a
nice
sunny
hazy
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
there
was
fair
head
retention
with
lasting
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
had
lemongrass
citrus
and
yeast
the
flavor
was
similar
to
aroma
with
lemon
and
yeast
some
malt
sweetness
that
complimented
the
creamy
mouthfeel
and
slight
alcohol
presence
poured
lemony
yellow
with
not
much
head
looks
delicious
grains
with
soft
citrus
and
floral
in
the
nose
almost
peppery
taste
with
nice
carbonation
hoppy
background
with
a
great
mouthfeel
very
nice
refreshing
beer
never
been
disappointed
by
a
dfh
except
for
black
and
blue
overall
quite
an
enjoyable
witbier
lemongrass
adds
but
does
not
overshadow
the
standard
wit
flavours
nice
beer
a
10
dollar
bottle
of
beer
better
impress
me
but
most
dogfish
heads
do
poured
this
sucker
into
the
glass
it
was
a
light
almost
hay
color
and
had
a
little
bit
of
sediments
the
aroma
the
label
says
it
best
you
smell
the
floral
and
citrus
aromas
you
can
taste
a
slight
carameliness
to
it
and
it
goes
down
super
smooth
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
light
which
is
non
typical
for
dogfish
head
another
inspirational
brew
nevertheless
try
it
its
worth
it
to
spend
more
when
it
counts
overall
easily
drinkable
if
you
like
the
sourness
of
lemons
which
i
do
this
would
be
ideal
with
a
fresh
salad
guess
ill
get
on
that
for
next
go
round
this
is
great
a
nice
sessionable
beer
for
the
summer
time
i
split
a
750
ml
bottle
of
this
with
my
wife
on
a
snowy
windy
october
day
the
beer
pours
a
milky
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
its
aroma
is
a
nice
mix
of
pepper
zesty
orange
peel
and
herbal
scents
lemon
orange
coriander
and
white
pepper
are
the
most
notable
scents
these
along
with
some
soft
pale
malt
underneath
give
the
beer
a
solidly
enjoyable
aroma
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
peppery
than
expected
with
a
sharp
spice
flavor
but
it
also
has
a
soft
sweetness
somewhat
abrupt
finish
well
balanced
and
the
orange
character
seems
to
give
the
beer
a
zesty
alive
quality
good
beer
750ml
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
portsmouth
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
body
with
a
good
half
inch
or
so
of
white
head
smells
very
fruity
and
floral
with
a
decent
amount
of
spice
oranges
coriander
lemon
pepper
and
hints
of
caramel
malt
hit
the
palate
light
bodied
with
ample
carbonation
superdrinkable
complex
and
unique
but
while
flavorful
this
beer
is
not
in
your
face
and
everything
blends
very
well
complimenting
each
other
a
great
witbier
im
quite
impressed
though
at
10
per
bottle
this
will
have
to
be
an
occasional
treat
nice
light
golden
ale
pours
soso
without
much
head
love
the
crisp
airy
citrus
aromas
best
part
of
the
ale
spicy
notes
especially
on
the
back
end
lend
to
the
refreshing
quality
of
the
beer
perfect
end
of
summer
beer
though
technically
summer
has
been
over
for
a
while
now
i
think
i
had
it
on
the
best
last
day
we
will
have
in
october
overall
the
beer
is
a
winner
and
above
average
but
dogfish
head
definitely
does
better
on
some
of
there
other
brews
cool
name
and
idea
though
o
not
your
typical
wit
and
thats
kind
of
what
i
expected
from
dogfish
i
liked
the
complexity
of
it
and
would
def
enjoy
a
few
more
drink
its
a
very
good
wit
i
have
had
some
shitty
ones
and
this
is
very
good
one
of
the
few
i
would
come
back
too
poured
this
clear
golden
yellow
beer
into
my
pint
glass
as
a
small
head
developed
i
detected
coriander
orange
peel
grain
and
a
bit
of
a
vegetal
funk
in
the
aroma
a
fine
wheat
beer
taste
with
noticeable
lemongrass
present
subtle
spices
very
light
and
refreshing
typical
of
the
style
quite
good
but
not
sure
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
o
outstanding
job
by
dogfish
head
smells
wonderful
taste
wonderful
and
feels
great
glad
i
dished
out
the
10
dollars
for
this
one
id
do
it
again
o
if
you
havent
tried
this
beer
you
need
to
this
is
everything
i
want
in
a
wheat
beer
and
more
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
terribly
perplexing
in
the
taste
but
the
taste
itself
is
very
good
o
a
refreshing
brew
dfh
does
witbiers
well
i
didnt
notice
the
alcohol
level
on
this
one
until
after
i
poured
and
tasted
the
brew
and
damn
does
this
have
some
wonderful
complexity
for
such
a
low
abv
its
spice
dominant
for
sure
but
the
underlying
grassy
and
herbal
tones
as
well
as
the
lovely
citrus
notes
make
for
a
great
take
on
a
wit
which
is
fast
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
not
one
of
the
top
witbiers
but
dfh
is
always
going
for
left
of
center
so
this
one
hits
the
mark
for
me
an
interesting
variation
on
a
belgian
witbier
at
least
i
think
that
is
what
they
were
aiming
for
i
liked
the
balance
of
flavors
from
the
grains
fruits
and
spices
decent
wit
with
some
interesting
qualities
one
id
give
a
moderate
recommendation
for
its
dfh
how
can
you
not
o
a
very
interesting
beer
not
what
i
was
expecting
fits
well
within
the
style
and
i
enjoyed
it
quite
a
bit
well
done
overall
not
a
bad
ale
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
dogfish
head
dogfish
head
has
disappointed
me
on
a
number
of
beers
though
this
one
is
excellent
a
spot
on
wit
that
is
incredibly
enjoyable
to
drink
something
i
would
highly
recommend
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
sometime
as
for
judging
it
to
a
witbier
it
is
different
but
shares
a
lot
of
the
same
qualities
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
the
style
overall
drinkable
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
light
beer
just
not
my
favorite
style
but
good
session
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
from
the
bottle
has
a
nice
two
finger
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
light
citrus
flavor
with
some
slight
bitterness
not
much
for
a
wheat
taste
but
this
is
not
overpowering
at
all
very
well
rounded
and
something
i
would
buy
again
o
its
tasty
and
easydrinking
much
better
than
the
average
witbier
mouthfeel
very
prominant
carboation
very
clean
mouthfeel
very
light
body
with
a
refreshing
quality
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
witbiers
in
general
but
this
one
is
probably
one
of
the
better
ones
that
i
have
had
but
keep
in
mind
i
havent
had
very
many
o
a
good
brew
but
not
overwhelming
not
worth
the
price
tag
but
still
a
nice
brew
to
split
with
your
lady
o
i
have
started
to
really
enjoy
beers
with
coliander
in
it
this
one
does
not
dissapoint
love
this
beer
drink
up
overall
4
0
its
light
bright
and
maybe
could
be
more
vibrant
but
its
refreshing
really
to
be
fair
this
bottle
has
sat
probably
too
long
for
the
optimal
flavor
point
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
but
its
still
quite
tasty
its
also
downright
quenching
this
is
a
beer
that
i
want
to
drink
multiple
glasses
of
and
feel
like
i
could
easily
do
so
will
definitely
get
this
again
750
ml
bottle
pours
cloudy

with
a
foamy
lasting
white

is
of
musty
yeast
citrus
fruit
with
hints
of
grass
and
spices
full
creamy
slightly
crisp

citrus

spices
belgium
yeast
and
candy
sugar
combine
on
the
palate
medium
semisweet
finish
im
not
a
fan
of
wits
but
this
one
i
like
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
hazy
orange
color
the
head
was
fizzy
and
kind
of
faded
away
rather
quickly
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
some
nice
lively
citrus
aromas
blended
with
a
soft
wheat
character
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
a
light
herbal
flavor
to
it
with
an
orange
or
lemon
flavor
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
lighter
bodied
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
the
warmer
seasons
i
would
drink
this
one
again
if
i
found
it
at
a
reasonable
price
serving
type
bottle
overall
a
stunning
beer
that
sadly
falls
short
on
the
finish
its
kind
of
like
a
really
hotsmart
girl
that
sadly
hasnt
read
a
single
book
you
know
oh
youre
so
pretty
oh
youre
so
smart
oh
you
dont
read
awww
i
knew
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
but
this
is
seriously
one
gorgeous
looking
beer
m
the
mouthfeel
is
spicedriven
so
much
so
that
the
witbier
base
doesnt
get
as
much
airtime
as
it
should
the
wheat
is
present
though
enough
tartness
to
keep
me
interested
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
bunch
dfh
is
my
favorite
brewer
at
the
same
time
if
i
was
looking
for
a
supercitrusy
beer
from
them
id
probably
locate
a
hellhound
and
get
lemoncrazy
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
great
for
the
summer
wheather
lighter
easier
to
drink
somewhat
pilsner
meets
wit
yagman
called
it
a
good
crossover
beer
for
a
fan
of
macro
wits
andthat
pretty
much
hits
it
on
the
head
yeasty
aroma
has
fruity
spicy
and
malty
hints
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
solar
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
that
still
leaves
some
good
lacing
malty
and
wheaty
flavor
has
a
firm
yeasty
undertone
and
floral
and
fruity
hints
and
is
very
refreshing
smooth
texture
has
fairly
firm
body
and
a
rather
strong
fizz
leaving
behind
a
persistent
tingle
bright
golden
hue
with
long
lasting
white
frothy
head
aroma
of
wheat
coriander
and
orange
peels
tastes
of
citrus
orange
peel
coriander
lemon
zest
fresh
hop
bitterness
finishes
the
drink
with
some
light
ginger
flavor
high
carbonation
and
spritzy
refreshing
sessionable
tasty
overall
looks
great
even
from
a
distance
and
taste
that
delivers
not
toptier
but
great
for
a
summer
day
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
all
about
the
added
spices
it
has
a
wit
base
that
almost
goes
into
saison
territory
but
ends
up
firmly
planted
in
its
lemon
citrus
flavors
refreshing
and
lighter
good
for
the
summer
o
overall
a
good
witbier
not
something
i
would
want
everyday
a
little
thin
in
mouthfeel
i
did
enjoy
the
dry
spicy
character
tasty
a
more
than
worthy
witbier
if
you
love
this
style
but
i
get
sort
of
bored
with
the
wit
these
days
so
i
can
just
admire
from
a
distance
really
its
not
like
i
need
dogfish
head
to
throw
tar
and
pickle
juice
into
a
beer
to
make
me
take
notice
not
at
all
although
hmm
i
wonder
what
a
pickled
pils
might
taste
like
ill
have
to
get
sams
note
though
this
beer
is
great
for
the
style
and
is
very
drinkable
it
does
break
away
from
the
off
centered
ale
strategy
that
dogfish
works
toward
this
one
is
very
much
more
standard
than
their
other
offerings
although
not
an
absolute
toplevel
witbier
this
brew
most
certainly
asserts
itself
as
the
embodiment
of
summer
in
my
opinion
thoroughly
enjoying
a
burger
on
my
back
porch
with
a
tall
cool
glass
of
namaste
crafted
a
lazy
august
summer
evening
that
i
will
surely
be
repeating
before
long
o
the
graininess
of
the
wheat
i
thought
outshined
the
fruitiness
of
the
lemons
and
oranges
a
good
average
witbier
that
i
thought
could
afford
a
bit
better
balance
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
corianderorange
peel
spicing
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
nice
and
refreshing
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
it
goes
down
easy
with
hints
of
coriander
and
lemongrass
along
with
a
faint
bitter
orange
peel
finish
the
profile
is
dead
on
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
tasty
beer
with
excellent
witbier
character
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style

a

there
was
a
bit
of
a

doesnt
linger
long
also
there
were
some
floaties
in
the

there
is
a

it
definitely
coriander

the

some

also

the

a

light

flavor
nice
hints

in
but
both
were
very
light
and
did
not
really
contribute
all
that
much
to
the
overall
approach
the
finish
was
very
dry
and
had
an
almost
light
wine
like
taste
to
it
very
long
and
drawn
out
it
was

release
namaste
might
be
the
best
americanmade
wit
its
more
citrusy
than
your
average
wit
adding
to
its
refreshment
and
complexity
a
pretty
nice
example
of
a
wit
the
coriander
character
is
actually
pretty
aggressive
but
somehow
i
am
enjoying
its
presence
in
this
beer
this
beer
was
lightbodied
and
refreshing
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
day
o
a
nice
witbier
and
glad
i
tried
it
but
it
was
missing
something
if
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
so
lean
it
would
definitely
get
more
points
from
me
in
the
tasts
otherwise
very
easy
to
drink
o
really
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
as
it
was
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
good
beer
but
its
nothing
amazing
another
exceptional
offering
from
dfh
had
this
in
a
pint
glass
served
out
of
one
of
dfhs
large
format
bottles
this
poured
a
very
very
light
color
with
a
voluminous
head
remniscent
of
pilsner
this
was
light
in
color
and
body
crisp
and
an
absolutely
refreshing
beer
for
a
104
degree
day
this
is
the
kinda
beer
you
can
slug
no
need
to
nurse
this
one
i
have
another
bottle
i
cant
wait
to
lay
into
ill
definitely
be
getting
more
o
im
kicking
myself
for
not
having
this
beer
sooner
in
fact
i
plan
on
buying
about
10
more
at
5
abv
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
for
these
above
90
degree
days
we
have
getting
latley
o
overall
a
good
brew
but
not
impressed
as
dfh
has
set
the
bar
for
many
unique
styles
this
one
falls
a
bit
short
namaste
pours
a
pale
barely
cloudy
light
yellow
body
with
2
inch
fluffy
head
lacing
lingers
all
over
the
wheat
beer
glass
smell
is
bananas
and
faint
citrus
really
only
what
i
expect
from
a
witbier
here
taste
is
initially
zesty
and
bold
coriander
but
then
balances
out
with
the
crisp
and
clean
lemon
flavor
banana
taste
is
dominant
there
is
moderate
carbonation
and
this
is
a
light
weight
brew
dogfish
head
pretty
much
playing
it
safe
here
with
a
solid
but
kind
of
boring
witbier
i
was
expecting
something
more
funky
even
though
its
a
witbier
and
i
noticed
the
regular
ingredients
were
used
for
this
style
of
brew
its
okay
and
ill
leave
it
at
that
o
very
good
tastes
nicely
balanced
i
didnt
find
the
yeast
to
be
as
prominent
as
in
other
witbiers
but
that
didnt
take
anything
away
from
the
beer
at
all
id
definitely
get
it
again
perfect
beer
for
an
afternoon
on
the
porch
taking
shelter
in
the
shade
wish
i
had
purchased
2
growlers
instead
of
1
overall
a
classy
white
beer
ideal
for
a
meal
where
you
want
a
lighter
pleasantly
spiced
beer
to
accompany
the
food
carbonation
was
extreamly
fine
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
yet
crisp
hops
helped
make
it
crisp
and
the
grain
and
hops
were
balanced
it
was
complex
yet
light
i
though
it
was
a
excellent
beer
especially
since
wheat
is
not
my
favorite
ingrediant
but
the
hops
strayed
too
much
from
the
style
for
my
taste
this
tastes
and
feels
great
in
my
mouth
i
pick
up
the
coriander
when
i
pull
air
across
it
the
orange
and
lemongrass
merge
nicely
with
each
taste
neither
is
overwhelming
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
thank
you
sam
o
quite
a
looker
in
the
glass
but
im
slightly
disappointed
at
the
taste
its
just
a
bit
subdued
that
being
said
its
a
godsend
in
the
texas
summer
its
certainly
a
quality
beer
wonderfully
refreshing
and
definitely
worth
a
try
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
got
to
compete
for
my
dollar
with
the
locally
brewed
512
witbier
o
overall
im
going
to
give
this
beer
a
a
for
what
it
is
an
extremely
refreshing
summer
witbier
from
dogfish
head
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
really
tasty
beer
and
id
drink
this
easily
after
a
hot
summer
day
being
that
its
only
5
abv
its
truly
a
pleasant
experience
to
drink
and
wont
get
you
too
hammered
i
recommend
this
beer
sweet
yeasty
fruit
mixed
with
oranges
and
very
soft
sweet
lemon
flavors
make
this
palate
quite
refreshing
and
flavorful
the
mouthfeel
is
full
of
carbonation
and
a
little
chalky
and
dry
this
only
makes
you
want
to
drink
more
poured
a
light
and
cloudy
dull
gold
with
a
fizzy
head
thanks
to
sharpgreat
carbonation
that
dies
quick
and
is
sitting
atop
a
very
sharp
lemony
wheat
aroma
picking
up
a
lot
citric
mostly
loemon
with
some
orange
banana
even
and
a
spicey
clovelike
smell
as
well
w
a
touch
of
sweetness
coming
from
somewhere
a
great
witbier
to
drink
is
what
follows
a
smooth
fluffy
body
thanks
to
the
wheatyeast
that
is
real
smooth
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
balance
to
this
beer
as
theres
a
sharpness
as
well
thanks
to
spices
and
a
sharp
but
not
overpowering
citric
bite
citric
consists
of
lemon
and
some
orange
and
theres
again
that
touch
of
sweetness
i
cant
identify
a
wellbalanced
beer
that
alternates
between
spicy
and
sharp
citric
and
throws
in
a
touch
of
sweet
stuff
for
a
very
enjoyable
brew
overall
a
killer
summer
refresher
and
a
great
witbier
one
of
my
favorites
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
and
easily
the
drinkability
is
offthecharts
id
drink
this
all
day
every
day
if
it
were
released
in
sixpacks
as
it
stands
now
its
too
pricey
for
anything
but
an
occasional
treat
but
what
a
treat
it
is
i
hesitated
when
i
was
bringing
this
one
up
to
the
counter
ten
bucks
for
a
style
at
a
low
abv
i
dont
usually
love
what
am
i
doing
turns
out
the
gamble
was
worth
it
this
is
a
delicious
brew
absolutely
worthy
of
attention
a
great
summer
beer
with
an
added
dimension
to
most
witbiers
nice
job
mo
drinkable
but
not
as
refreshing
as
many
other
wits
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
d
while
not
completely
traditional
the
careful
craftsmanship
and
great
balance
of
spices
make
this
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
ever
had
this
one
is
entirely
drinkable
chuggable
whatever
and
on
par
with
its
belgian
peers
in
that
aspect
but
a
shot
above
in
terms
of
aroma
and
flavor
and
in
the
balance
and
quality
of
the
ingredients
used
a
standout
in
a
style
i
normally
do
not
like
that
much
belgian
style
yet
so
pleasing
to
regular
summer
consumers
by
being
both
zesty
and
hoppy
cloudy
light
grapefruit
coloured
body
with
tons
of
foam
orange
citrus
is
thee
main
taste
comes
across
as
4555
ibu
lemongrass
cushions
the
mouthfeel
and
leads
to
a
nice
aftertaste
good
flavour
for
such
a
basic
abv
smooth
mouthfeel
creamy
thanks
for
sharing
doug
taste
shows
some
very
good
classic
witbier
flavors
pithy
orange
tangy
wheat
and
coriander
nice
and
flavorful
and
the
mouthfeel
is
ultra
soft
and
creamy
like
drinking
a
cloud
falls
near
the
top
of
the
class
as
far
as
wits
are
concerned
but
still
a
10
witbier
seriously
this
style
deserves
to
be
affordable
and
put
down
a
few
without
thinking
too
much
great
beer
but
for
as
good
as
it
is
i
cant
really
see
buying
this
again
o
another
interesting
brew
by
dogfish
head
it
was
a
refreshing
beer
to
have
to
have
on
a
hot
day
it
looks
and
feels
a
bit
like
champagne
i
like
the
spice
and
the
citrus
and
the
light
bubbly
body
quite
refreshing
and
a
nice
beer
to
drink
on
an
85degree
day
no
major
complaints
but
nothing
about
it
really
wowed
me
beer
this
particular
bottle
had
quite
a
bit
of
sediment
in
it
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
the
color
was
a
nice
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
frothy
white
head
musty
odor
a
little
farmlike
with
elements
of
lemon
and
coriander
taste
is
a
delicious
clean
wheat
flavor
complemented
nicely
with
lemongrass
and
citrus
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
wheat
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
enjoy
this
all
summer
d
very
smooth
beer
extremly
refreshing
almost
thirst
quenching
in
a
way
easy
to
drink
i
could
see
my
self
drinking
this
beer
on
a
regualr
basis
if
it
was
a
year
round
option
from
dfh
namaste
pours
a
hazy
tangerine
it
seems
a
shade
or
two
darker
than
most
wits
that
ive
had
the
pristine
white
head
rises
up
to
about
three
fingers
in
height
and
shows
tremendous
resilience
lacing
is
a
bit
sparse
though
the
nose
is
very
lemony
with
coriander
as
the
primary
supporting
aroma
rather
than
orange
the
flavor
is
quite
crisp
yet
dominated
entirely
by
yeastspice
notes
lemongrasss
influence
is
still
the
star
here
though
the
flavor
seems
a
bit
more
citrusy
than
the
nose
coriander
is
still
present
as
a
background
note
again
the
body
is
nice
and
light
and
the
carbonation
starts
out
incredibly
lively
but
dies
down
by
the
back
end
of
each
sip
and
avoids
being
too
fizzy
lemongrass
is
a
wonderful
addition
to
the
standard
witbier
flavors
and
helps
make
this
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
warm
weather
beers
as
much
as
i
do
like
festina
peche
i
find
myself
wishing
this
was
available
in
12oz
bottles
all
summer
the
closest
thing
i
have
smelled
to
the
strange
funk
of
this
beer
has
only
been
present
in
some
saisons
and
that
one
time
i
tried
lindemans
faro
as
the
type
of
person
who
seeks
out
the
strange
and
unusual
freak
beers
i
heartily
endorse
this
oddity
a
very
nice
summer
beer
with
wheat
beer
character
it
is
light
and
very
drinkable
for
those
hot
days
especially
with
that
low
5
percent
abv
tatse
spicy
and
citrusy
with
a
soft
mineral
finish
just
enough
hops
to
tie
it
all
together
overall
thanls
to
inlimbo77
for
this
great
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
and
that
is
saying
something
since
i
udually
dont
care
for
this
style
good
job
sam
and
company
for
another
winner
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
goes
down
smooth
and
with
a
nice
body
of
flavors
very
well
done
o
this
is
a
good
witbier
that
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
witbier
from
dogfish
head
hard
to
say
if
id
buy
multiples
perhaps
moreso
if
this
was
in
6ers
nonetheless
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
spring
beer
for
this
rainy
wet
streak
we
have
going
o
refreshing
o
its
a
pretty
nice
and
well
rounded
hefeweizen
the
addition
of
the
lemongrass
was
an
excellent
choice
its
a
pretty
good
beer
but
i
am
not
finding
the
urge
to
have
another
its
interesting
but
isnt
the
best
hefeweizen
ive
had
it
lacks
balance
my
friend
and
i
who
enjoyed
this
with
me
at
the
brewpub
realized
that
namaste
is
best
when
paired
with
food
its
a
tasty
summer
brew
then
a
solid
summertime
beer
good
take
on
a
witbier
from
dogfish
head
d
a
simple
refreshing
beer
very
straightforward
nothing
edgy
or
provocative
about
this
one
something
i
have
come
to
expect
and
relish
in
other
dfh
offerings
a
nice
spring
summer
offering
theres
nothing
wrong
with
this
one
but
not
something
i
would
highly
recommend
either
namaste
sorry
dogfish
head
but
i
found
another
brew
of
yours
i
dont
care
for
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
with
a
light
aroma
of
crisp
floral
hops
it
gets
points
for
being
very
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
however
where
was
the
taste
i
cant
believe
id
say
such
a
thing
about
a
dfh
brew
but
there
was
almost
no
flavor
in
this
at
all
which
was
disappointing
after
reading
the
ingredients
bear
in
mind
refreshing
yes
quaffable
yes
flavorful
no
o
overall
a
very
solid
wit
that
i
could
see
purchasing
again
overall
nice
wit
lemongrass
plays
well
overall
what
we
found
most
enjoyable
about
this
brew
was
the
twinge
of
lemongrass
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
the
aroma
is
actually
the
most
robust
and
striking
part
of
the
brew
with
all
of
the
proper
components
popping
there
was
a
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
especially
with
the
myriad
of
citrus
going
on
but
nothing
important
was
lost
where
it
did
lose
points
was
in
the
carbonation
which
did
become
a
bit
overwhelming
a
straw
yellow
hazy
beer
with
creamy
head
that
faded
slow
and
left
creamy
walls
of
lace
the
smell
was
of
belgian
yeast
with
banana
and
clove
nicely
balanced
in
the
middle
and
citrus
tones
of
orange
and
lemon
grass
on
the
back
end
nice
honey
caramel
and
biscut
notes
with
a
good
grainy
wheat
backbone
nice
citrus
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
subtly
perk
things
up
creamy
body
it
goes
light
on
the
banana
in
the
yeast
flavors
and
the
spice
is
subtle
too
just
a
pinch
of
clove
and
pepper
smooth
creamy
and
very
drinkable
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
lighter
but
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
pours
a
hazed
light
gold
color
poof
of
frothy
white
head
that
lingers
and
leaves
decent
lacing
scent
is
very
floral
with
herbal
qualities
and
fresh
dried
wheat
lemongrass
lends
great
charachter
along
with
juicy
orange
and
spice
corriander
and
light
pepper
taste
immediately
suprises
the
palate
with
a
pleasent
floral
taste
the
lemongrass
adds
subtle
complexity
much
prefered
to
lemon
rind
and
mingles
with
the
fresh
dried
grain
some
herbal
qualities
come
through
before
notes
of
orange
and
light
nutty
spice
hit
medium
bodied
carbonation
a
tick
below
others
in
the
style
which
adds
to
the
beer
a
pleasent
suprise
uses
some
unique
and
high
quality
ingredients
to
make
a
best
in
class
wit
d
wow
this
is
surprisingly
good
i
am
not
generally
a
fan
of
witbier
but
the
balance
between
the
wheat
and
the
spices
here
works
exceptionally
well
the
lemongrass
the
lemongrass
is
a
really
nice
touch
it
helps
cut
through
the
cloying
thickness
that
many
other
wits
seem
to
develop
and
it
makes
the
beer
taste
much
brighter
unusually
drinkable
and
very
much
worth
trying
o
really
a
pleasant
beer
reminiscent
of
summer
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
dont
think
that
i
would
ever
seek
this
beer
out
but
it
was
enjoyable
to
have
it
once
and
i
could
see
some
people
really
going
for
it
big
on
the
spice
citrus
and
yeast
and
a
nice
wheat
beer
upon
opening
this
beer
the
citrus
smells
just
made
me
smile
it
truly
does
hold
that
summertime
feel
the
pour
produced
a
nice
rich
white
head
which
lasted
for
quite
sometime
the
color
was
a
golden
sheen
as
it
drank
down
the
lacing
left
just
a
soft
amount
on
the
glass
but
its
to
be
expected
from
this
wheat
beer
the
taste
was
refreshingly
good
but
not
as
complex
as
i
was
hoping
i
did
enjoy
the
citrus
notes
and
drinkability
of
it
though
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
looking
for
a
nice
clean
and
refreshing
evening
beer
to
accompany
good
porchsitting
weather
of
the
summer
months
overall
i
was
really
impressed
with
this
offering
from
dfh
lately
a
lot
of
their
experimental
beers
have
been
interesting
but
just
extreme
for
the
sake
of
being
so
interesting
experiments
but
not
terribly
enjoyable
one
and
done
kind
of
beers
this
beer
on
the
other
hand
was
complex
and
flavorful
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
it
again
especially
with
summer
coming
around
the
taste
is
nothing
short
of
amazing
loads
of
orange
is
definitely
there
with
heaps
of
coriander
as
well
just
a
very
flavorful
wit
all
around
this
is
how
you
do
it
the
slightly
grainy
wheat
shows
up
just
after
along
with
a
small
zing
at
the
back
which
ill
assume
is
the
lemongrass
perhaps
the
best
wit
i
have
ever
had
and
thats
saying
something
when
its
considered
that
this
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
styles
very
nice
beer
id
much
rather
have
it
in
a
set
of
affordable
12oz
bottles
than
a
single
10
750
but
ill
probably
buy
again
anyway
o
i
am
surprised
at
how
little
if
at
all
this
beer
pushed
the
limits
there
is
really
nothing
offcentered
about
it
it
is
a
good
not
great
representation
of
the
style
i
feel
it
lacks
the
character
of
wheatiness
that
should
be
present
in
a
wit
i
will
not
be
seeking
this
out
again
o
excellent
representation
of
the
style
does
not
push
the
envelope
at
all
but
completely
nails
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
beer
i
will
keep
this
one
on
hand
for
my
friends
that
always
order
those
mass
produced
and
artificial
tasting
witbiers
overall
this
is
a
very
quaffable
beer
and
at
the
5
abv
level
a
bunch
of
glasses
can
easily
be
consumed
in
a
session
well
balanced
and
nicely
flavored
this
one
will
have
you
looking
for
some
more
when
the
glass
is
empty
namaste
on
tap
at
papago
well
hazed
body
with
a
meringue
head
patchy
lace
nose
is
quite
spicy
with
notes
of
white
pepper
and
coriander
flavor
is
zesty
with
orange
peel
and
spicy
with
coriander
herbal
tealike
notes
come
through
especially
in
the
finish
body
is
medium
for
style
pretty
light
overall
carbonation
leaves
the
mouthfeel
slick
and
the
finish
dry
very
drinkable
and
nice
for
those
warm
days
good
for
style
the
taste
is
of
wheat
and
lemongrass
the
lemongrass
really
shines
in
this
brew
also
coriander
orange
floral
notes
flowery
yeast
white
tea
and
some
light
spices
that
i
cant
nail
down
a
light
dry
mouthfeel
and
nicely
balanced
between
sweet
and
tart
very
well
done
dfh
this
beer
had
a
hazy
appearance
with
small
bits
of
sediment
although
it
had
a
nice
citrus
floral
nose
amazing
taste
as
if
youre
biting
into
a
fresh
orange
that
finishes
with
lingering
hints
of
lemongrass
on
the
palate
a
refreshing
brew
for
warmer
weather
drinkability
quaffable
to
say
the
least
dogfish
did
a
great
job
crafting
a
witbier
with
a
unique
flair
refreshing
with
a
good
mix
of
fruit
and
spice
d
this
an
easy
to
like
drinkable
beer
d
3
5
not
wellenough
balanced
for
me
to
enjoy
much
of
this
i
could
split
the
750ml
but
wouldnt
want
much
more
it
is
a
bit
sour
and
overcarbonated
i
can
get
some
of
the
ingredients
that
were
used
and
i
appreciate
that
but
they
just
didnt
work
as
well
together
as
i
had
hoped
they
would
worth
a
shot
i
suppose
additional
notes
requires
a
weekend
nap
if
more
witbiers
were
similar
to
namaste
i
would
probably
drink
the
style
more
often
this
is
a
great
beer
with
much
to
offer
the
senses
o
awesome
twist
from
dfh
and
not
surprised
at
all
cant
wait
to
enjoy
this
under
the
sun
next
time
very
easy
to
drink
with
that
being
said
i
almost
wish
it
had
more
of
an
alcohol
presence
yes
i
understand
it
is
a
wit
but
maybe
a
little
more
kick
would
be
nice
the
biggest
knock
i
have
on
this
brew
is
its
11
dollar
price
tag
a
bit
steep
to
me
3
0
d
this
has
some
problems
with
carbonation
foremost
this
beer
started
out
so
well
it
looked
great
and
smelled
better
but
the
house
of
cards
fell
down
with
the
taste
the
flavor
is
too
light
for
my
liking
this
would
be
a
good
lawnmover
beer
but
not
for
the
price
o
a
very
tasty
refreshing
beverage
pours
a
pale
slightly
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
pure
white
head
that
sticks
around
as
medium
cap
and
leaves
some
decent
lacing
nice
spicy
and
lemony
aromas
with
a
particularly
nice
floral
hit
of
lemongrass
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
subtle
with
a
gentleness
overall
some
very
light
spice
notes
some
decent
lemongrass
and
a
soft
finish
the
beer
could
use
a
little
more
crispness
and
a
little
more
depth
of
flavor
but
overall
its
fairly
intriguing
and
quite
refreshing
medium
body
fairly
light
carbonation
nice
mouth
feel
and
drinks
easy
as
pi
darn
good
beer
overall
i
good
flavorful
witbier
nice
flavors
and
mouthfeel
and
a
good
refreshment
quality
hay
colored
with
a
haze
fair
head
retention
with
a
little
lace
and
plenty
of
carbonation
hay
and
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
aroma
nice
carbonation
profile
up
front
and
in
the
middle
grain
coriander
and
lemongrass
are
present
in
the
middle
with
a
little
bit
of
soap
on
the
back
end
faint
bitterness
medium
body
leaning
toward
the
light
side
id
buy
this
more
often
if
it
came
in
a
6er
i
got
this
one
at
a
discount
but
would
probably
not
get
more
at
full
bigbottle
prices
the
wife
and
i
are
not
much
into
light
wheat
beers
but
found
this
to
be
exceptionally
tasty
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
it
has
a
nice
yellowish
color
and
goes
down
very
smooth
dogfish
head
makes
some
amazing
beers
and
most
being
810
alcohol
this
is
only
5
but
does
not
disappoint
all
in
all
a
another
great
beer
from
dogfish
head
o
overall
a
decent
witbier
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
crowd
much
just
another
coriander
and
orangepacked
witbier
o
a
nice
clean
bear
for
its
class
nothing
impressive
for
dogfish
but
never
the
less
good
taste
is
very
light
and
crisp
easy
drinking
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
sharp
and
light
its
a
mellow
beer
and
not
crazy
almost
peaceful
great
flavor
above
average
drinkability
pretty
straightforward
definitely
worth
it
if
you
dig
wits
i
give
this
high
marks
for
the
emphasis
on
coriander
and
the
excellent
mouthfeel
can
you
say
extremely
drinkable
craft
beer
well
done
this
is
a
good
wit
that
i
am
enjoying
but
it
doesnt
blow
me
away
the
way
that
allagash
white
does
and
since
that
is
a
local
beer
here
ill
go
for
a
bottle
of
that
next
time
i
am
craving
this
style
that
isnt
to
say
you
shouldnt
give
this
beer
a
shot
it
is
a
very
well
made
beverage
that
is
worth
a
taste
o
i
liked
it
and
am
glad
i
got
to
try
it
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
thanks
again
mark
for
hooking
it
up
overall
i
was
a
fan
of
this
beer
however
its
not
quite
clean
enough
to
take
a
place
in
the
upper
tier
still
an
easydrinking
beer
that
will
be
great
for
warmer
months
d
this
has
good
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
and
i
really
like
the
flavor
it
is
refreshing
and
i
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
overall
i
think
this
is
a
good
beer
and
id
try
it
again
smells
like
lemons
what
a
refreshing
delight
what
with
its
super
bubbly
personality
giant
cumulus
head
magically
parts
at
the
command
of
my
gob
high
quench
factor
with
little
bitter
in
this
spicy
concoction
what
a
dry
ride
this
one
was
get
it
my
gob
commands
it
750ml
shared
with
my
buddy
poured
into
stemless
wine
glass
opaque
straw
yellow
very
yellow
white
three
finger
head
that
leaves
some
belgian
lacing
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
spices
with
coriander
and
lemongrass
dominating
and
orange
peal
playing
second
fiddle
orange
coriander
and
citrus
on
the
front
of
the
palate
and
than
all
lemongrass
to
the
finish
the
lemongrass
is
a
huge
flavor
it
does
however
play
well
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
nice
wheaty
flavor
pairs
well
with
the
spices
and
some
fruity
yeast
twang
can
be
found
too
well
bodied
for
a
smaller
ale
overall
dogfish
succeeded
on
this
one
albeit
with
a
bit
too
much
lemongrass
flavor
overall
im
glad
i
tired
it
but
unfortunately
the
hennepin
i
just
cooked
with
has
noticeably
more
flavor
than
this
bottle
poured
into
a
snifter
this
is
a
fizzy
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
very
foamy
inch
of
head
smell
is
sour
and
dominated
by
lemon
with
a
strong
mix
of
cloves
and
coriander
spiciness
taste
is
extremely
spicy
again
heavy
on
the
cloves
and
coriander
with
some
peppercornish
flavors
as
well
very
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
lots
of
orange
and
lemon
flavors
as
well
mouthfeel
is
foamy
and
creamy
good
tasty
wit
with
lots
of
good
characteristics
and
some
uniqueness
in
the
flavor
profile
would
have
again
very
refreshing
light
body
with
refreshing
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
not
the
most
exciting
style
but
simple
and
well
done
opinion
i
think
that
i
can
now
say
that
i
have
a
favorite
spiced
beer
i
had
liked
some
of
the
christmas
ales
and
i
dont
know
if
the
brasserie
de
rocs
beers
count
as
spiced
but
this
is
a
world
class
witbier
no
doubt
sam
did
this
beer
just
the
way
it
should
have
been
done
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
impressed
i
paid
around
9
for
this
bottle
so
unfortunately
isnt
cheap
but
i
would
definitely
recommend
that
you
give
this
one
a
shot
overall
rather
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
a
fine
beer
suitable
for
drinking
in
the
drearily
warmer
months
ahead
of
us
o
overall
this
is
another
good
one
from
dogfish
i
quite
enjoyed
it
and
it
would
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
alabama
day
in
july
this
is
just
one
beer
that
doesnt
quite
suit
my
tastes
right
now
i
would
certainly
recommend
a
bottle
to
try
though
i
think
ill
give
this
one
another
go
after
a
round
of
golf
in
hothumid
july
afternoon
othis
is
a
great
offering
from
sam
and
the
guys
at
dogfish
i
could
imagine
sitting
out
on
the
beach
this
summer
drinking
these
all
day
one
of
the
best
witbiers
out
there
wish
i
would
have
known
about
this
one
a
few
years
ago
really
enjoyed
this
one
and
im
looking
forward
to
more
another
score
from
dfh
a
perfect
spring
beverage
for
everyone
well
over
21
d
a
very
nicely
crafted
and
highly
drinkable
witbier
from
dfh
perfect
for
the
impending
warmth
of
early
spring
id
love
to
pair
it
with
a
lemonbroiled
monkfish
or
light
nutty
cheese
d
a
good
expression
of
a
witbier
very
refreshing
o
a
real
disappointment
from
what
im
used
to
with
this
brewery
i
would
say
this
is
the
first
time
that
dogfish
really
totally
flopped
for
me
i
drain
poured
the
last
10
ounces
unless
ive
had
a
bad
bottle
which
i
dont
think
thats
the
case
i
would
say
to
avoid
this
brew
and
try
the
many
other
fine
witbiers
on
the
market
d
i
wanted
to
hate
on
this
mainly
because
im
tired
of
the
hype
surrounding
dfh
but
i
have
to
admit
i
found
it
very
fitting
on
this
warm
spring
day
its
very
well
balanced
and
you
can
tell
care
was
taken
to
do
this
one
right
nothing
fancy
none
of
the
headlinemaking
publicity
whoring
dfh
has
become
known
for
just
a
well
conceived
and
executed
beer
namaste
is
a
common
spoken
greeting
in
india
that
means
literally
i
bow
to
you
all
of
us
need
to

only
5
abv
one
of
the
better
examples
at
incorporating
a
good
lemon
flavor
d
overall
refreshing
but
almost
too
easy
to
drink
like
i
said
above
if
there
was
more
of
a
bread
characterrichness
i
think
it
would
be
much
more
enjoyable
d
great
drinkability
excellent
springsummer
beer
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
a
very
nice
sparkling
carbonation
present
the
dry
finish
has
no
notes
of
alcohol
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
success
from
dogfish
head
d
this
brew
is
light
and
refreshing
has
many
nice
layers
enjoy
now
or
set
one
aside
for
the
summer
months
when
it
will
be
really
pleasing
cheers
super
drinkable
the
back
label
says
its
a
summer
kind
of
thing
namaste
theyre
right
get
one
now
and
save
it
for
the
warm
weather
its
a
perfect
compliment
to
it
dogfish
namaste
is
a
fantastic
white
beer
and
is
delicious
way
better
then
a
blue
moon
shock
top
etc
garbage
beers
its
in
the
same
class
as
allagash
white
it
more
then
lives
up
to
the
expectations
of
what
a
white
beer
should
be
and
the
history
behind
the
name
adds
to
the
greatness
that
we
expect
from
dogfish
head
brews
let
the
haze
consume
you
and
delight
in
the
namaste
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
given
the
light
body
and
5
abv
it
might
get
boring
after
a
couple
bottles
though
alas
this
is
not
my
style
would
be
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
just
one
for
me
too
rich
in
the
bananalike
herbal
spice
yeast
otherwise
though
its
a
good
beer
for
the
style
d
really
nice
great
for
the
style
i
would
say
a
great
representation
of
the
sytle
enjoyed
on
tap
at
the
fairfax
brewpub
in
virginia
this
witbier
shows
a
cloudy
light
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
cover
and
good
lacing
it
reveals
a
bready
light
citrus
lemon
smell
that
includes
a
slight
peppery
quality
the
flavor
offers
a
classic
white
ale
theme
that
includes
a
light
bananalemon
subtle
idea
over
sodabread
and
oak
it
is
medium
light
bodied
with
a
slightly
aqueous
feel
over
firm
carbonation
very
drinkable
like
most
of
this
variety
and
a
better
than
average
version
poured
into
a
dfh
12
oz
fluted
bass
glass
golden
straw
color
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
cloudyness
lovely
lemongrass
and
coriander
aroma
with
a
smooth
frothy
head
medium
head
retention
with
minimal
lacing
taste
backed
the
nose
as
a
lemony
wheat
malt
cascaded
with
floral
hops
balance
this
one
nicely
wonderful
velvety
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
was
a
bit
nicer
as
the
beer
warmed
a
bit
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
and
i
was
interested
in
the
use
of
lemon
grass
this
is
not
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
however
it
does
offer
new
flavors
in
an
old
favorite
it
is
refreshing
and
slightly
sweet
yet
the
sweet
is
tamed
by
the
the
bitterness
of
the
lemon
and
the
herbaceous
notes
of
grass
it
would
make
an
excellent
quencher
on
a
warm
day
and
would
match
well
with
fish
or
lemon
chicken
d
had
mine
with
a
piece
of
chipolte
salmon
in
a
tai
lime
chili
sauce
very
good
together
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
color
with
a
nice
two
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
lemongrass
with
a
hint
of
honey
as
well
the
taste
has
a
nice
citrus
flavor
along
with
a
big
lemongrass
taste
there
are
hints
of
honey
as
well
along
with
a
wheat
backbone
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
the
drinkability
is
high
a
nice
mellow
flavor
that
is
well
blended
on
top
of
being
an
easy
drink
you
could
easily
have
multiple
servings
of
these
d
an
easy
crisp
drinker
with
fresh
fruit
tastes
great
for
a
summer
afternoon
d
nice
drinkability
though
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
you
will
start
feeling
the
slowdown
a
bit
a
bright
zing
brings
a
good
start
to
the
drink
while
a
bomber
should
suffice
and
be
a
good
example
per
style
d
yes
this
would
make
an
excellent
summer
wit
great
taste
and
easy
drinking
poured
from
750ml
bottle
into
snifter
glass
pours
a
hazy
straw
gold
color
with
an
inch
white
head
head
retention
and
lacing
are
both
pretty
good
the
brew
smells
like
coriander
orange
peel
wheat
and
some
yeast
it
tastes
like
oranges
lemon
peel
coriander
wheat
and
a
bit
of
peppery
spice

is
lightmedium
its
crisp
and
is
well
carbonated

is
very
good
its
nice
refreshing
and
really
easy
to

thanks
cam
pours
a
murky
golden
yellow
with
a
good
amount
of
white
head
lots
of
carbonation
on
this
one
smells
wheaty
and
citrusy
lots
of
coriander
on
the
nose
on
the
tongue
there
is
tons
of
orange
and
coriander
not
a
lot
more
on
the
tongue
honestly
but
its
very
good
high
carbonation
and
a
good
mouthfeel
medium
to
full
bodied
for
the
style
i
liked
this
but
it
was
a
bad
idea
to
attempt
the
750ml
on
my
own
the
whole
bottle
was
a
bit
much
to
drink
in
a
sitting
d
not
my
favorite
dogfish
head
but
one
of
the
nicest
wits
that
i
have
had
light
bodied
and
effervescent
which
makes
it
a
bit
filling
still
a
nice
drinker
even
on
a
midjanuary
day
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
releases
this
year
the
beer
is
a
light
brew
with
a
wonderfull
birght
gold
color
to
it
the
head
forms
perfectly
with
out
any
help
and
leaves
lacing
down
the
glass
the
aroma
in
the
brew
was
of
a
spice
and
fruit
background
to
me
with
some
earthy
tones
the
taste
was
a
light
crisp
and
packed
with
flavor
mouthfeel
was
perfect
and
not
to
carbonated
and
the
light
abv
makes
this
beer
my
session
beer
of
the
year
love
it
and
keep
it
stocked
in
the
fridge
when
ever
i
see
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smells
is
very
sweet
with
lemon
and
grass
also
clove
is
detected
the
taste
is
mostly
a
combination
of
the
grass
and
lemon
it
is
very
interesting
i
dont
like
it
but
i
dont
hate
it
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
has
a
good
mouthfeel
overall
decent
but
didnt
win
me
over
to
buy
it
regularly
its
definitely
more
of
a
summer
beer
too
the
appearance
is
a
bright
golden
yellow
beer
with
a
fluffy
head
that
quickly
declines
into
a
ring
also
lots
of
floating
good
stuff
in
this
beer
this
beer
smells
like
summer
for
sure
i
detect
lemon
lime
an
almost
sour
edge
to
the
mild
grass
and
clover
essence
this
bottle
tasted
very
thin
and
bitter
i
detected
a
strong
lemon
tartness
and
i
detected
the
coriander
in
the
background
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
mild
brew
a
good
relaxer
as
to
drinkability
i
found
it
quite
accessible
its
easy
to
drink
and
its
got
enough
character
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
whether
that
character
fits
your
taste
buds
is
another
question
but
its
not
really
that
bold
to
begin
with
so
i
doubt
that
anyone
will
find
it
offputting
worth
trying
d
this
would
definitely
be
one
of
my
top
picks
for
a
great
summer
beer
and
one
of
the
better
witbiers
ive
had
i
could
drink
this
all
day
drinkability
i
really
wish
i
could
get
this
beer
in
six
pack
form
this
would
be
my
new
goto
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
nothing
is
overdone
the
citrus
elements
are
tactful
and
well
executed
the
spice
from
the
coriander
is
subtle
and
not
too
sharp
and
the
malts
used
to
brew
this
beer
provide
just
enough
depth
to
make
this
a
interesting
beer
to
sip
at

abv
this
is
a
more
approachable
dogfish
head
concoction
as
it
goes
down
like
a
charm
bravo
to
sam
and
everybody
down
in
coastal
deleware
nice
job
dogfish
head
as
always
d
really
nice
this
dfh
offering
really
impressed
me
im
hoping
theyll
make
this
one
again
i
enjoyed
this
back
in
november
on
a
chilly
night
but
it
would
be
perfect
on
a
summer
afternoon
d
this
is
a
good
beer
fits
a
niche
desire
although
subtle
offer
a
complex
variety
of
experience
dont
pass
up
but
dont
expect
a
big
beer
this
is
a
slow
grows
on
you
kind
of
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
very
session
worthy
one
and
done
here
granted
this
probably
would
taste
better
if
it
wasnt
so
dang
cold
outside
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
namaste
forges
few
gripes
in
my
mind
wellcrafted
through
through
plus
at
5
abv
its
a
easy
sipper
for
sure
fully
enjoyable
even
in
this
ohio
winter
d
im
definitely
picking
up
more
of
this
next
summer
and
drinking
it
when
its
hot
outside
d
this
is
most
definitely
a
summer
beer
very
light
in
body
and
has
a
low
abv
although
i
am
not
a
huge
light
beer
fan
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
drinking
it
in
the
winter
a
good
white
beer
but
pricey
for
what
it
is
taste
begins
moderately
sweet
coupled
with
lemongrass
again
moderately
tart
in
the
middle
and
closes
with
light
earthy
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
drinkability
is
excellent
very
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
brew
not
bad
but
id
rather
have
a
six
pack
of
hoegaarden
for
the
money
ours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
white
head
that
recedes
to
some
nice
lacing
smell
is
lemon
grass
coriandercitrus
peel
and
some
clove
taste
follows
the
nose
with
light
lemon
and
citrus
but
light
on
flavor
but
its
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
well
carbonatedbut
a
bit
thin
on
the
taste
it
is
a
tasty
witbier
its
very
drinkable
and
well
done
for
the
style
the
namaste
pours
a
dark
straw
yellow
on
the
verge
of
light
orange
with
a
very
light
white
head
that
circles
the
glass
its
definitely
light
but
does
have
moderate
cloudiness
the
smell
is
superb
it
features
coriander
orange
peel
barnyard
funkiness
and
subtle
sweetness
the
flavor
is
good
as
satisfying
its
got
excellent
coriander
and
orange
accents
and
has
an
orange
like
sweetness
the
yeastiness
is
well
contained
and
this
beer
drinks
very
well
it
just
doesnt
have
the
same
mouthfeel
same
smoothness
that
is
typical
of
dfh
750s
then
again
it
is
a
much
lighter
beer
this
beer
is
delicious
and
is
an
excellent
wheat
to
my
knowledge
namaste
is
an
indian
greeting
that
means
bow
to
you
the
label
alludes
to
something
similar
im
not
sure
that
theres
any
real
indian
tie
to
this
beer
but
there
doesnt
need
to
be
its
a
damn
tasty
witbier
thats
worthy
of
your
attention
the
nose
is
extremely
impressive
the
flavor
could
maybe
use
a
few
more
amps
on
the
corianderorange
peel
to
really
ramp
it
up
but
i
cant
complain
i
really
enjoyed
this
and
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
pours
golden
yellow
with
a
very
thin
head
that
recedes
to
the
edges
immediately
then
lingers
for
the
duration
of
the
drink
smells
of
herbs
and
spice
with
light
peppery
and
yeast
notes
the
taste
is
light
with
faint
hints
of
orange
tea
sugar
and
wheat
the
mouth
feel
is
small
easy
to
drink
and
you
could
easily
down
the
entire
bottle
without
thinking
twice
since
the
beer
is
only
5
abv
definitely
a
summer
brew
but
tasty
none
the
less
the
beer
finishes
with
a
crisp
slightly
bitter
but
clean
flavor
without
a
strong
after
taste
definitely
a
recommendation
for
the
spring
and
summer
months
lightly
bitter
finishing
dry
with
a
smooth
wheat
body
citrus
and
coriander
flavors
are
dominant
but
not
overbearing
it
feels
a
little
astringent
but
overall
its
not
a
distraction
fairly
easy
to
drink
probably
better
suited
for
warmer
months
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
will
try
again
if
another
batch
is
released
drinkability
is
very
good
only
draw
back
would
be
price
dfh
and
me
have
love
hate
relationship
some
things
they
do
are
great
some
are
wtf
were
they
thinking
this
is
defiantly
very
well
done
and
im
loving
it
ommegange
witte
was
better
but
my
favorite
is
great
lakes
grassroots
ale
formerly
great
lakes
hale
ale
both
of
those
are
more
affordable
and
more
available
but
namaste
remains
a
good
beer
that
i
would
be
proud
to
serve
overall
a
solid
wit
that
ranks
near
the
top
for
me
nice
strong
aroma
and
bite
in
the
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
wish
this
one
was
available
more
often
and
near
me
not
avail
here
in
tx
so
shipped
back
from
my
dayton
trip
rotation
if
here
and
in
12oz
bottles
would
be
a
heavy
player
in
my
witwheat
rotation
even
in
large
format
id
still
get
plenty
ry
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
brief
but
sudsy
head
that
leaves
little
evidence
that
it
had
ever
been
there
great
flavors
of
the
advertised
orange
coriander
and
lemon
grass
distinct
notes
of
each
throughout
low
alcohol
and
medium
body
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
though
the
lemony
aftertaste
can
get
a
bit
tiresome
drinkability
quite
a
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
i
think
after
awhile
i
would
get
tired
of
the
flowery
flavors
but
for
one
bottle
i
think
its
quite
tasty
mouthfeel
pretty
thin
much
like
the
head
there
isnt
much
to
this
beer
d
slightly
disappointed
for
dogfish
head
not
very
complex
dat
5
id
say
this
is
the
most
drinkable
of
the
dogfish
head
750ml
bottles
the
taste
stays
great
it
goes
down
easily
what
more
could
you
ask
for
750ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
nice
murky
pale
orange
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
fruits
and
spices
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
and
fruits
with
lemon
zest
and
coriander
the
beer
is
quite
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
smooth
carbonation
this
is
a
very
respectable
wit
one
id
certainly
have
again
overall
great
beer
very
drinkable
liking
this
even
more
than
i
was
anticipating
this
would
be
great
on
a
warm
summer
afternoon
not
to
sure
why
it
didnt
get
distributed
till
the
fall
if
dogfish
makes
a
normal
beer
especially
in
large
format
bottles
this
would
be
it
this
would
be
a
good
crossover
beer
into
the
craft
world
as
well
another
extremely
different
brew
from
dfh
while
quite
interesting
not
sure
id
get
this
one
again
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
and
a
great
example
of
a
wit
could
drink
a
number
of
these
if
not
for
the
fairly
high
price
point
would
like
to
see
dogfish
add
this
one
as
a
repeating
seasonal
fantastic
brew
overall
i
would
almost
say
this
borders
closely
to
a
saison
as
far
as
taste
and
texture
i
had
the
opportunity
to
have
this
on
tap
and
much
prefer
the
bottle
you
get
more
of
the
nuances
from
the
bottle
conditioning
this
should
be
in
the
regular
dfh
rotation
possibly
the
most
drinkable
of
the
entire
dogfish
line
very
quenching
and
an
ideal
warm
weather
beer
d
i
think
this
would
be
a
good
summer
quencher
which
makes
me
wonder
why
we
didnt
get
it
until
november
close
to
a
finger
of
bone
white
head
sort
of
dilute
foam
no
density
with
many
larger
bubbles
as
a
result
very
little
retention
lacing
fares
better
not
many
streaks
but
the
ones
there
stick
around
pale
golden
orange
color
however
has
a
nice
luminescence
to
it
which
fills
the
glass
on
the
whole
transparent
but
with
a
serious
gauziness
fresh
and
open
nose
full
but
not
close
to
heavy
the
orange

its
the
carbonation
notes
nicely
crafted
and
well
taken
care
of
offering
from
dfh
nothing
outstanding
though
and
feeling
rather
safe
but
almost
saying
it
as
a
compliment
however
it
feels
a
tad
overpriced
for
what
one
finds
in
the
end
d
if
it
wasnt
40
degrees
out
and
was
instead
summer
id
be
able
to
have
a
few
of
these
and
enjoy
it
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
brew
it
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
overall
it
is
well
balanced
yet
bold
with
its
flavor
and
scent
for
the
style
the
lemony
aspect
could
be
tamed
down
a
bit
but
it
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
and
probably
the
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
in
recent
memory
despite
the
exaggerated
lemon
flavor
this
beer
needs
to
be
around
come
summertime
next
year

refreshing
would
make
an
excellent
match
for
seafood
or
salad
highly
recommendedespecially
in
summer
was
also
present
in
the
taste
however
for
the
smell
the
spice
flavor
was
not
nearly
as
intense
as
expected
flavor
left
quickly
after
swallowing
light
very
drinkable
but
the
aroma
and
flavor
will
keep
you
wanting
more
a
great
and
aweful
beer
to
practice
trying
to
pick
out
smells
and
flavors
and
glad
i
can
say
i
finally
had
something
that
kevin
patterson
hadnt
had
before

like
today
is
i
think
this
is
a
good
overall
brew
nice
and
sessionable
id
like
to
see
this
beer
put
in
a
6pack
but
ill
still
buy
bombers
of
this
notes
very
refreshing
perfectly
done
wit
a
delicious
witbier
with
sharp
aggression
towards
the
spicy
and
aromatic
notes
yet
perserving
the
delicate
and
soft
textures
that
make
classic
witbiers
so
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
overall
a
good
beer
to
kick
back
and
read
a
book
with
d
its
a
good
beer
if
the
flavour
combination
is
yout
thing
for
me
it
just
didnt
work
maybe
paired
with
the
right
food
it
would
pop
a
little
better
the
flavour
is
spot
on
but
that
mouthfeel
is
just
far
too
thin
a
solid
beer
overall
i
dont
get
the
hate
for
it
poured
into
a

the

is

with
some

orange

a

the

pretty

a

onedimensional

quite
well

brew
this
beer
pours
a

with
a
little
head
that
did
last
overall
this
beer
kinds
stinks
smells
strongly
of
wheat
and
lemon
has
a
nice
complex
taste
alot
of
wheat
flavors
strong
orange
and
lemon
flavors
a
light
flavor
but
very
easy
to
drink
overall
a
complex
and
very
good
wheat
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
bright
golden
color
with
a
onefinger
white
head
head
retention
is
light
and
lacing
is
minimal
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
lemongrass
and
coriander
you
also
can
pick
out
some
yeastiness
and
a
little
orange
peel
if
you
search
for
it
as
with
the
aroma
the
taste
is
almost
entirely
lemongrass
and
coriander
with
ligher
hints
of
orange
and
yeast
and
virtually
no
alcohol
noticeable
its
a
fairly
clean
taste
but
id
really
like
to
taste
the
base
beer
more
and
the
adjuncts
less
the
body
is
a
bit
light
on
this
one
with
moderate
carbonation
and
no
alcohol
warming
not
overly
drinkable
because
of
the
dominance
of
the
lemongrass
and
coriander
and
the
relative
lack
of
complexity
it
doesnt
help
either
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
witbiers
this
one
is
probably
not
worth
the
pricetag
unless
you
really
love
lemongrass
and
coriander
d
i
guess
i
just
dont
get
most
of
these
dogfish
head
beers
i
think
the
ideas
are
generally
coolinteresting
but
i
dont
always
find
they
translate
well
in
application
good
beer
that
brings
a
bit
of
welcome
innovation
to
the
style
this
could
be
a
onesession
bomber
drinkability
is
great
i
really
hope
dfh
brings
this
one
back
next
summer
a
perfect
refreshing
summer
afternoon
beer
quaffable
and
tasty
not
extreme
like
most
of
dfhs
beers
but
very
well
done
worth
picking
up
if
youre
looking
for
a
balanced
tasty
easy
drinking
beer
overall
i
am
very
impressed
with
this
offering
a
unique
take
on
a
witbier
but
they
do
a
good
job
thanks

a
cloudy
straw
body
is
topped
by
a
small
white
head
that
drops
to
a
thin
collar
smells
like
herbal
tea
and
wheat
bread
lemongrass
and
coriander
both
come
through
very
very
strongly
the
adjuncts
are
overpowering
as
usual
with
dfh
tastes
of
watery
herbal
tea
white
bread
white
pepper
and
strong
coriander
spices
linger
on
the
tongue
in
the
finish
not
necessarily
awful
but
not
good
its
over
spiced
yet
somewhat
watery
a
very
good
wit
and
very
drinkable
the
mouthfeel
is
as
light
as
the
taste
making
this
exceptionally
drinkable
and
refreshing
d
the
only
downside
to
this
beer
is
the
price
we
got
this
in
pa
and
split
it
with
some
friends
down
there
good
beer
but
unless
it
was
a
lot
cheaper
i
would
not
go
for
it
again

the

a
citric
twist
goes
down
ok
i
know
id
enjoy
this
more
in
the
summer
still
good
and
worth
the
try
d
sorry
to
say
that
i
had
this
on
a
cold
and
rainy
new
england
day
it
would
be
much
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
that
said
this
is
still
a
top
witbeer
in
my
mind
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
fine
bubbled
creamy
textured
head
forms
thick
and
leaves
behind
scattered

aroma
is
so
nice
a
full
on
assault
of
coriander
citrus
peels
and
lemongrass
notes
sharp
bright
wheat
note
as
well
it
works
together
well
i
really
enjoy
just
smelling
this
stuff
flavor
wise
this
is
an
excellent
witbier
its
rare
to
see
any
beer
brewed
this
much
to
style
other
than
the
lemongrass
theres
not
much
stray
from
a
typical
wit
and
this
is
an
excellent
fresh
version
of
one
heavy
on
the
coriander
for
those
sensitive
to
it
this
wont
be
your
beer
but
its
definitely
a
rounded
coriander
its
complemented
with
orange
peel
bitterness
and
lemon
grass
herbal
tones
soft
wheat
creamy
character
this
is
excellent
stuff
mouthfeel
has
sturdy
but
smooth
carbonation
creamy
body
carries
itself
well
light
to
medium
in
girth
clean
spicy
finish
these
spices
dont
sit
on
the
palate
the
carbonation
and
citrus
helps
to
clear
the
coriander
drinkability
overall
is
excellent
a
really
drinkable
version
of
a
dead
on
american
brewed
witbier
i
would
get
more
but
not
for
10
to
12
bucks
a
750ml
bottle
now
where
did
i
put
that
triple
imperial
d
great
drinkability
super
light
easily
could
down
a
bunch
of
these
due
to
the
low
abv
5
and
the
overall
lightness
of
the
style
i
bought
a
bottle
after
tasting
since
my
fiance
who
isnt
a
real
beer
drinker
let
alone
a
hoppy
ipa
dfh
drinker
really
loved
this
beer
an
overall
good
beer
for
its
style
cheers
d
a
beer
i
consider
to
be
pure
refreshment
i
was
surprised
by
this
but
happy
w
how
good
it
was
i
could
enjoy
this
for
hours
and
it
is
clean
and
refreshing
wout
sacrificing
flavor
smells
exactly
like
how
i
would
think
lemongrass
smells
it
also
has
that
orange
and
witbier
type
smell
to
it
it
also
has
a
nice
straw
like
hazy
appearance
with
some
sediment
in
it
as
the
rest
of
the
bottle
is
poured
into
the
glass
the
taste
is
awesome
with
that
lemon
taste
and
that
smooth
orange
taste
that
gets
bitter
at
the
end
of
the
sip
the
bitterness
is
different
than
youd
find
in
most
beers
because
of
the
orange
taste
melding
together
with
the
lemon
taste
the
bitterness
is
like
licking
the
inside
skin
of
an
orange
i
like
it
also
has
a
nice
dry
wheat
backing
to
finish
everything
off
excellent
beer
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
low
alcohol
content
on
the
bottle
making
the
drinkability
awesome
great
summer
beer
that
i
hope
they
keep
making
not
to
mention
i
love
the
name
namaste
because
its
a
spiritual
word
meaning
soul
great
name
and
a
great
beer
especially
for
a
witbier
the
best
witbier
ive
tasted
hands
down
d
very
drinkable
while
it
isnt
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
i
would
probably
have
another
if
the
other
beers
available
were
less
desirable
d
goes
down
easily
nicely
balanced
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
little
too
heavy
for
summer
drinking
but
on
a
nice
early
autumn
night
this
is
really
refreshing
d
a
pretty
good
witbier
lots
of
oranges
and
lemon
in
the
smell
and
taste
would
definitely
try
again
my
wife
hated
it
of
course
just
like
she
does
most
beer
oh
well
this
is
a
pretty
good
witbier
that
being
said
appearance
and
smell
aside
this
beer
is
nothing
extrordinary
the
beer
pours
cloudy
gold
with
a
thin
off
white
head
the
beer
smells
intensely
of
itrus
praticularly
orange
and
lemon
the
taste
is
strong
of
the
fruits
and
coriander
with
a
wheaty
finish
hals
light
carbonation
and
given
the
brewer
overall
it
seems
light
a
perfect
sipper
for
the
summer
though
beer
is
creamy
and
medium
bodied
overall
its
nice
and
clean
bright
and
citrusy
both
my
wife
and
i
completely
enjoyed
this
beer
very
excellent
its
pale
straw
colored
not
as
hazy
or
golden
as
it
should
be
and
the
nose
is
also
something
of
a
disappointment
as
its
a
weak
clove
and
not
much
else
it
picks
up
citrus
flavors
the
dried
orange
is
prominent
and
delicious
and
a
tangy
wheat
background
in
the
taste
without
really
delivering
on
the
spice
until
the
finish
and
then
its
coriander
not
so
much
cloves
very
light
lowcarbonation
bodyi
wasnt
in
love
with
this
beer
but
its
a
good
refreshing
wit
and
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
while
it
was
still
out
d
disappointing
for
dfh
decent
by
other
standards
the
beer
poured
a
super
murky
yellowishlight
orange
head
was
about
a
half
inch
and
disipates
into
a
thin
layer
ontop
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
minimal
with
hints
of
earthy
hay
and
some
lemony
scents
as
well
the
beers
flavor
is
well
balanced
with
a
good
bit
of
citrus
coriander
and
a
light
belgian
yeast
spicyness
medium
body
that
is
quite
drinkable
not
what
i
expected
from
dfh
but
not
a
bad
beer
might
get
another
bottle
to
enjoy
some
other
summer
day
d
very
easy
to
drink
whole
bottle
in
one
sitting
maybe
even
2
or
3
and
great
for
summer
a
very
nice
surprise
from
dfh
being
only
5
abv
since
i
feel
that
most
of
the
beers
under
6
are
not
as
good
as
their
stronger
beers
i
would
love
to
see
this
made
more
often
maybe
even
replace
festina
pêche
as
the
summer
seasonal
i
will
be
heading
back
to
the
liquor
store
tomorrow
to
stock
up
as
much
as
i
can
adequate
carbonation
was
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
will
have
to
go
back
and
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
before
they
run
out
absolutely
delicious
and
highly
drinkable
beer
great
for
any
season
but
especially
perfect
now
pours
a
hazed
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
white
head
and
little
lacing
aroma
is
very
mild
slightly
tangy
and
citrusy
with
some
lemon
and
fresh
cut
grass
flavor
starts
off
initially
extremely
tangy
exacerbated
by
overly
active
carbonation
middle
of
the
body
has
some
more
typical
wit
characteristics
before
a
strong
peppery
and
lemon
grass
finish
mouthfeel
is
fluffy
and
medium
thick
initially
dominated
by
over
active
carbonation
which
distracts
from
whatever
is
going
on
with
the
flavors
the
finish
is
a
little
more
spicy
and
peppery
than
i
like
and
doesnt
seem
well
integrated
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
a
nice
refreshing
beer
but
not
particularly
well
balanced
or
pleasing
this
is
a
definite
pass
for
me
i
must
say
given
its
status
as
a
dogfish
head
specialty
beer
i
was
expecting
something
a
bit
more
outrageous
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
a
nice
refreshing
balanced
witbier
good
for
the
summer
months
though
maybe
not
worth
the
9
a
bottle
wouldnt
mind
seeing
this
in
6packs
in
the
future
though
i
split
a
large
bottle
at
little
ortinos
in
schwencksville
pa
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
soft
white
head
the
mix
of
subtle
spice
dominates
the
flavor
not
in
a
bad
way
while
theres
a
smooth
belgian
wheat
background
the
individual
spices
dont
stand
out
so
much
as
just
melt
together
from
the
orange
peel
to
the
coriander
then
lemongrass
all
in
all
a
tasty
beer
near
the
top
of
the
style
overall
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
not
what
i
expect
from
dfh
who
are
known
for
their
big
brews
nice
summer
brew
to
be
enjoyed
body
is
a
little
thick
to
me
isnt
bad
in
any
way
just
thicker
than
normal
carbonation
is
really
nice
and
drinkability
really
high
all
in
all
this
is
a
refreshing
and
superbly
drinkable
witbier
displaying
the
strong
qualities
of
the
style
while
adding
in
a
few
new
twists
of
its
own
boy
i
hope
this
turns
into
regular
release
because
its
certainly
one
of
dfhs
best
this
a
very
quaffable
wit
packed
with
flavor
the
spice
might
be
a
bit
too
much
but
in
the
end
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
very
honorable
for
dfh
to
sell
this
beer
as
a
benefit
to
drie
fonteinen
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
and
carbonation
is
high
drinkability
is
good
especially
on
this
hot
day
very
light
and
refreshing
with
some
great
citrus
flavors
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
i
missed
this
guy
at
the
brewpub
but
apparently
fate
intervened
to
give
me
a
second
chance
it
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
topped
by
about
two
fingers
of
white
sudsy
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
pepper
coriander
lemon
peel
clove
rice
cakes
banana
cardamom
and
the
slightest
possible
touch
of
funk
and
i
use
funk
in
its
loosest
form
the
taste
leans
heavily
on
the
citrus
and
wheat
leaving
the
spicier
notes
languishing
in
the
fetal
position
actually
to
properly
describe
the
situation
the
peppers
on
prozac
so
its
still
dancing
about
in
the
finish
as
though
all
of
its
problems
were
really
gone
how
sad
really
the
body
is
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
fairly
dry
finish
overall
a
very
nice
wit
nuff
said
baby
namaste
pours
a
beautiful
slightly
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
ample
carbonation
that
produces
a
soft
white
head
full
of
tiny
bubbles
the
head
stays
around
forever
and
leaves
some
goopy
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
notes
of
honey
lemon
zest
orange
wheat
bready
yeast
and
a
touch
of
white
pepper
the
flavor
is
very
refined
and
very
tasty
with
a
very
sweet
yet
also
slightly
tart
wheat
malt
background
it
is
lemony
and
spicy
with
hints
of
white
pepper
and
coriander
and
is
very
refreshing
it
is
well
balanced
and
all
of
the
flavors
play
off
of
each
other
very
well
for
being
a
fairly
sweet
beer
it
is
impressive
how
thirst
quenching
it
is
it
has
a
fairly
light
and
creamy
mouthfeel
that
has
a
tart
and
refreshing
finish
very
drinkable
and
a
beer
that
i
am
glad
came
in
a
large
bottle
d
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
a
fun
take
on
the
traditional
witbier
i
could
easily
keep
drinking
this
beer
on
a
nice
summer
afternoon
a
little
more
citrus
to
this
one
than
youd
be
used
to
if
you
were
into
wits
i
like
it
quite
a
bit
but
it
wont
dethrone
some
of
the
more
faithful
styles
for
me
d
session
if
you
were
in
the
mood
great
with
the
fried
seafood
and
pizza
we
were
enjoying
and
worthy
of
simply
sitting
and
sipping
one
to
explore
with
great
satisfaction
cheers
drinkability
a
very
different
style
from
dogfish
i
have
a
bottle
that
i
want
to
age
a
little
but
it
was
enjoyable
and
i
would
have
again
if
the
opportunity
arose
d
oh
hells
yes
this
is
super
drinkable
a
great
summer
beer
its
a
shame
it
was
a
limited
run
and
i
cant
find
it
locally
because
id
love
to
grab
another
bottle
for
a
party
namaste
pours
into
the
glass
looking
bright
hazy
yellow
with
somehazy
yellow
and
specs
or
squeezed
orange
it
gets
darker
towards
the
end
of
the
bottle
with
the
yeast
a
nice
bright
white
head
with
good
retention
but
no
stick
semi
thick
looking
smells
include
wheat
coriander
lemongrass
and
orange
peel
i
get
alot
of
sweet
cereal
like
scents
kinda
like
honeycombs
its
off
putting
taste
starts
off
great
with
wheat
mixed
in
with
coriander
and
lemongrass
squeezed
orange
makes
for
a
push
but
is
overpowered
by
the
lemongrass
which
rules
the
roost
in
the
middle
banana
comes
out
to
play
with
warming
things
turn
downhill
this
gets
a
bit
to
sweet
for
me
and
the
cereal
comes
through
and
a
bit
artificial
tasting
adding
the
yeast
at
the
end
did
not
make
things
better
even
sweeter
the
feel
is
above
light
bodied
and
is
quaffable
and
refreshing
to
a
degree
its
carbed
up
as
well
but
fades
with
warming
leaving
for
a
thicker
coat
for
a
sec
i
liked
this
for
the
1st
12oz
or
so
but
grew
tired
of
it
and
poured
the
rest
out
its
just
not
my
type
of
wit
its
to
style
but
not
incredibly
balanced
good
for
a
gander
d
its
too
bad
that
i
had
to
split
this
one
but
we
agreed
that
another
bottle
would
have
been
quite
pleasurable
to
digest
cheers
too
bad
we
dont
get
it
out
on
the
west
caost
md
it
is
thin
bodied
with
great
carbonation
was
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
will
have
to
go
back
and
pick
up
another
bottle
or
two
taste
was
wonderful
best
wit
ive
had
very
true
to
style
with
light
coriander
and
orange
going
on
nice
crisp
beer
which
is
another
addition
to
the
great
list
of
session
beers
i
have
tried
as
of
late
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
tonight
especially
now
that
i
know
proceeds
re
for
a
good
cause
a
nice
enough
beer
though
i
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
flavor
really
nothing
to
get
excited
about
and
probably
something
i
would
not
bother
to
order
again
d
goes
down
very
easy
and
the
lower
abv
makes
this
quite
sessionable
perfect

im
an

guy
who
can
veer
a
little
for
other
good
brews
but
not
for
this
pass
not
a
fan
of
pepper
beers
so
this
one
was
just
too
much
the
peppers
made
it
seem
like
a
mess
of
muddled
flavors
overall

with
a

character
im
surprised
how
little
of
the
ingredients
i
found
in
my
sample
but
i
was
at
a
brew
fest
i
must
try
this
beer
again
edit
forgot
to
say
this
is
supremely
drinkable
i
know
am

quite
refreshing
aroma
of

is
quite
dominant
with
some

notes
coriander
notes
are
also
noticeable
and
are
wellbalanced
against
the
sweeter
malt
base
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
with
no

very
nice

and
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
again
on
hot
summer
days
o

5
witbier
theres
not
a
thing
in
here
that
resembles
any
wit
ive
ever
had
i
guess
they
just
needed
someplace
to
stick
it
its
a
complex
beer
but
its
not
very
drinkable
and
i
cant
imagine
ever
wanting
to
try
this
again
750ml
bottle
this
one
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
there
was
a
thin
white
head
that
doesnt
linger
or
leave
much
lacing
it
has
a
nice
nose
some
apple
spicy
and
earthy
the
taste
is
very
good
it
has
a
touch
of
bitterness
earthy
apple
and
spices
nice
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
almost
throughs
a
tinge
of
chartreuse
into
things
actually
coincidentally
enough
ok
its
just
my
willful
belief
its
almost
hte
same
colour
as
the
album
cover
in
the
year
3030
finger
and
a
half
of
white
driven
snow
fades
soon
enough
you
really
get
the
cider
on
the
nose
its
sweet
and
crisp
up
front
round
pears
and
a
bit
of
belgian
yeast
minor
light
spices
not
picking
up
much
depth
behind
that
the
cider
takes
front
court
again
spicy
belgian
yeast
brings
pear
to
the
party
and
the
belgian
spice
segues
nicely
into
the
light
cayenne
heat
at
the
end
the
finish
is
surprisingly
earthy
and
bitter
a
characteristic
that
was
not
necessarily
present
earlier
in
the
profile
dunno
if
the
cilantro
and
farro
could
be
contributing
to
the
earthiness
or
if
im
just
making
hte
connection
because
i
was
looking
for
them
since
id
read
the
description
but
at
the
very
least
its
not
completely
without
the
realm
of
believability
i
enjoyed
this
beer
immensely
its
complex
its
different
and
it
kept
me
guessing
o
a
super
unique
imperial
witbier
with
a
superb
layering
of
flavors
very
much
worth
checking
out
rich
golden
color
with
excellent
clarity
theres
an
inch
of
tightly
knit
bright
white
foam
and
some
light
brussels
lacing
i
get
a
lot
of
spices
within
the
aroma
but
i
think
the
cilantro
and
cider
stand
out
the
most
the
flavor
is
powerfully
spiced
and
you
really
get
the
cilantro
which
is
a
bit
refreshing
and
gives
it
a
vegetal
edge
the
cider
gives
a
light
sweetness
the
cayenne
gives
a
slight
warmth
and
and
the
cider
offers
some
dryness
in
the
mouth
awesome
brew
its
nice
to
try
something
new
and
fresh
an
interesting
beer
the
apple
is
balanced
not
powerful
but
enough
to
give
it
character
sweet
but
the
hint
of
spicing
balances
it
this
pours
a
mostly
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
slight
foamy
head
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
wheat
citrus
and
banana
in
the
aroma
among
other
hints
the
taste
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
belgian
wit
beer
as
you
get
the
bold
yeasty
banana
taste
but
an
interesting
group
of
spices
dont
let
the
cilantro
or
dried
cayenne
pepper
turn
you
off
as
you
wouldnt
even
know
those
ingredients
were
in
there
a
very
interesting
beer
the
appearance
was
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
the
smell
was
mostly
apples
with
a
little
bit
of
herb
the
taste
is
mostly
apple
but
theres
a
lot
of
great
subtle
flavors
earthy
herbs
and
a
nice
medley
of
spices
mixes
with
the
citrus
hops
and
makes
a
very
interesting
flavor
i
like
the
finish
very
clean
and
refreshing
if
youre
a
fan
of
spiced
beers
and
ciders
this
is
probably
a
great
fit
for
you
o
the
depth
of
this
beer
is
great
many
layers
of
flavors
and
feels
its
fresh
and
wet
and
then
theres
the
bite
and
heat
in
the
finish
also
this
will
sneak
up
on
you
so
easy
to
drink
for
a
9
and
unexpected
for
a
witbier
overall
a
tasty
concoction
lacks
any
trace
of
most
of
the
ingredients
however
o
a
wellcrafted
beer
each
flavor
was
distinct
and
pretty
clear
although
that
earthy
mineralitychalkiness
took
away
from
it
somewhat
im
surprised
this
one
worked
the
ingredients
are
pretty
diverse
but
somehow
melded
well
a
good
novelty
tasting
o
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
dogfish
brewery
a
simple
beer
with
high
abv
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
stronger
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
try
it
buy
more
and
pray
they
start
bottling
this
in
sixpacks
because
this
is
incredibly
drinkable
very
interesting
beer
somewhat
of
a
beer
and
cider
hybrid
which
isnt
as
common
as
it
maybe
should
be
fuji
is
a
great
choice
of
apple
to
go
with
this
strong
blonde
ale
clean
looking
with
a
soapy
inch
of
white
head
it
smells
interesting
more
apple
heavy
than
anything
and
i
honestly
dont
get
any
cayenne
pepper
maybe
a
little
bit
of
spices
but
more
cider
type
than
heat
type
for
me
the
taste
is
similarly
apple
driven
without
being
sweet
i
mean
its
still
beer
first
no
doubt
which
i
appreciate
but
its
most
flavorful
adjunct
is
by
far
the
apples
juicy
and
fresh
this
takes
me
to
fall
with
a
pronounced
spice
finish
but
again
hard
to
place
it
as
cayenne
at
all
which
i
also
dont
particularly
mind
the
feel
is
the
best
feature
its
so
creamy
like
it
came
from
a
nitro
tap
its
full
bodied
but
almost
puffy
on
my
palate
and
it
swallows
clean
amazing

surprisingly
well
hidden
abv
another
weirdo
beer
from

but
this
one
is

successful
than
others
really
top
quality
stuff
and
i
cant
imagine
a
beercider
fusion
coming
out
any
better
than
this
one
this
is
a
fine
relaxing
beer
to
be
enjoyed
with
friends
and
hearty
laughter
during
a
hot
summer
afternoon
decent
look
upon
first
pour
smell
is
very
similar
to
a
hard

taste
is
very
crisp
and
cider
like
as
well
but
than
followed
by
a
punch
of
yeast
maybe
even
the
slightest
bit
sour
at
the
end
still
very
light
and
drinkable
for
a
beer

o
glad
i
had
this

most
of

are
just
too
hit

to
shell
out
about
15
bucks
only
to

i

i
could

purchasing
this
again
so
long
as
ive

to

with
this

the
second
beer
with

in
it
that
ive
had
and
still
not
sure
that
its
for
me
i
really
enjoyed
apple
and
belgian
yeast
combo
though
maybe
dfh
should
break
into
the
cider
business
prost
overall
pc
is
a
beverage
that
desperately
needs
to
be
paired
with
food
me
i
was
fairly
neutral
about
this
contact
o
a
big
complex
beer
that
is
somewhere
between
a
saison
and
a
wit
or
grand
cru
despite
its
heft
and
obvious
alcohol
it
is
drinkable
and
keeps
you
wanting
more
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
witbiers
but
there
was
not
much
that
would
make
me
want
to
buy
this
one
again
boulevards
two
jokers
is
the
domestic
standard
bearer
for
this
style
in
my
eyes
positive
contact
cant
measure
up
to
two
jokers
o
this
is
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
try
it
really
helps
define
dfhs
slogan
of
offcentered
ales
for
offcentered
people
this
beer
is
anything
but
normal
and
very
hard
to
categorize
pours
a
big
airy
head
well
over
three
fingers
bleached
white
dissolves
at
a
speedy
clip
very
little
stickiness
so
not
much
lacing
appearing
transparent
with
a
dilute
yellow
to
orange
coloration
quite
a
few
fat
and
lazy
bubbles
rising
within
looks
as
much
as
a
cider
as
a
beer
the
nose
is
both
crisp
and
sweet
the
apples
come
through
as
well
as
cinnamon
spice
there
is
a
leafy
spiciness

peg
it
as

of
note
has
very
good
staying
power
which
is
pleasing
in
place
of
the
missing
complexity
fullbodied
super
creamy
and
coats
the
entire
mouth
the
carbonation
is
all
fluffiness
no
cleansing
aspect
the
apples
supported
by
banana
peach
pear
and
that
same
cinnamon
nutmeg
spice
the
cayenne
comes
through
as
an
afterthought
muted
even
the
flavors
are
sweet
the
texture
gets
dry
by
the
finish
so
any
yeastiness
becomes
truncated
more
enjoyable
colder
not
that
it
gets
flabby
as
it
warms
but
the
components
start
to
blur
no
problem
throwing
it
back
but
leaves
you
with
little
desire
for
a
second
or
third
glass
overall
unique
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
but
also
surprisingly
complex
overall
i
was
impressed
with
this
beer
for
how
tasty
the
flavors
were
and
how
well
the
abv
was
hidden
wish
the
bottles
were
not
so
expensive
i
would
have
grabbed
a
few
overall
pricey
but
a
tasty
bottle
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
overall
a
rather
tasty
take
on
a
strong
wit
beercider
hybrid
rather
refreshing
and
a
good
one
to
give
a
try
to
overall
this
is
one
of
the
dogfish
misses
for
me
really
dont
care
for
what
the
cilantro
brings
normally
i
like
cilantro
but
i
am
certainly
not
picking
it
up
in
this
beer
color
was
a
golden
amber
almost
like
a
apple
juice
a
few
small
streams
of
carbonation
rose
from
the
bottom
the
head
was
a
1
finger
fluffy
white
that
only
last
2
or
3
minutes
initially
poured
similar
to
a
sparkling
apple
cider
aroma
was
like
a
sweet
apple
cider
not
as
sweet
as
a
juice
but
the
apples
were
definitely
noticeable
a
small
bit
of
banana
in
the
back
as
well
flavor
was
sweet
but
still
a
bit
dry
a
little
bit
of
peppery
yeast
as
well
coated
nicely
not
overly
stickey
or
chewy
not
as
much
carbonation
as
i
would
expect
on
the
style
notes
overall
a
unique
beer
not
necessarily
true
to
style
notes
but
well
balanced
with
a
very
unique
flavor
o
i
think
its
a
pretty
well
executed
beer
considering
the
components
however
not
a
beer
i
would
add
to
the
list
to
remember
skip
the
cilantro
and
i
would
try
again
usually
hate
the
taste
unless
the
peppers
have
enough
heat
to
overpower
it
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
what
can
be
done
to
make
a
witbier
stand
out
its
not
my
favortie
but
it
certainly
stands
out
the
9
is
wellhidden
and
its
very
tasty
the
price
is
a
little
high
but
it
certainly
wouldnt
be
an
allthetime
beer
for
me
give
it
a
shot
d
dogfish
is
known
for
the
off
centered
ales
and
fearless
experimentation
this
one
may
be
the
most
out
there
and
it
comes
with
surprising
results
while
this
is
not
something
i
would
drink
with
regularity
it
really
is
something
that
anyone
looking
to
challenge
their
palate
and
experience
something
should
check
out
a
witbier
cider
cayenne
pepper
wtf
but
you
know
what
it
oddly
works
and
makes
for
a
refreshing
and
enjoyable
brew
all
in
all
a
great
beer
may
be
too
much
going
on
to
really
get
it
all
but
i
like
it
dogfish
head
positive
contact
45
i
really
like
this
beer
in
fact
im
surprised
by
how
much
i
like
this
beer
i
was
pretty
sure
that
the
cider
addition
was
going
to
be
over
done
and
it
would
be
too
tart
and
thin
or
it
would
be
over
spiced
and
taste
like
potpourri
luckily
you
dont
get
either
of
those
what
you
do
get
is
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
with
a
lot
of
apple
flavor
but
not
sourness
a
noticeable
hint
of
bubblegum
particularly
in
the
aroma
a
rich
nuttiness
which
id
assume
is
from
the
farro
and
a
substantial
body
very
nice
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
dryer
malt
and
almost
pils
like
in
the
taste
a
dry
fruitiness
with
a
small
dry
nuttiness
a
small
hop
like
bite
and
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
fruitiness
in
the
aftertaste
decent
fruity
and
quite
lager
like
a
pretty
imperial
witbier
and
a
lot
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
i
think
that
dogfish
head
did
a
great
job
with
this
beer
and
will
probably
get
another
one
pours
a
two
finger
head
that
fades
slowly
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
some
lace
crystal
clear
amberstraw
color
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
spicy
yeast
nose
flavor
is
spicy
and
herbs
not
tasting
any
cayenne
but
late
sweetness
from
the
fuji
apples
14
99
for
a
750ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
definitely
not
the
worst
beer
dfh
has
ever
churned
out
surprisingly
complex
but
it
missed
the
mark
a
little
and
ended
up
too
sweetclose
to
cider
the
yeast
helped
a
bit
but
just
seemed
to
muddle
things
a
bit
overall
a
very
nice
beer
i
think
they
did
a
great
job
with
it
lots
of
flavor
without
one
characteristic
being
too
overpowering
o
im
not
really
sure
what
the
appropriate
drinking
situation
is
its
superrefreshing
but
also
quite
strong
proceed
with
caution
this
pours
a
yellowish
orange
with
a
nice
white
head
kind
of
lighter
than
a
cider
and
darker
than
a
whitbier
the
smell
is
nothing
remarkable
reminds
me
a
little
of
a
farmhouse
ale
and
a
little
like
a
belgium
strong
the
taste
was
also
a
lot
more
ordinary
than
i
was
expecting
i
really
pick
up
no
cilantro
or
cheyann
or
really
not
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
of
cider
either
it
does
have
a
belgium
spice
to
it
with
a
nice
finish
but
was
hoping
for
a
lot
more
most
disappointed
in
the
missing
cheyann
since
i
was
wishing
this
would
have
a
little
bit
to
it
overall
very
drinkable
and
clean
not
what
i
was
expecting
at
all
though
just
another
me
too
kind
of
beer
still
love
dogfish
head
though
o
a
fine
cider
offering
from
dfh
if
youre
interested
in
something
sweet
spicy
and
hot
this
is
one
for
you
o
a
very
interesting
beer
a
complex
mix
of
fruit
bitterness
and
spice
very
enjoyable
at
first
but
turning
heavy
and
cloying
as
it
warmed
while
it
was
not
my
favorite
witbier
i
found
it
complex
and
challenging
and
worth
trying
to
find
a
bottle
o
solid
enjoyable
but
wont
necessarily
be
memorable
hides
its
9
abv
very
well
a
tempest
of
bubbles
violently
race
to
the
top
of
the
glass
contributing
to
a
crownlike
white
head
this
is
a
pretty
beer
the
smell
is
enticing
sweetness
blossoms
and
yeast
a
but
of
malt
candy
and
spice
witlike
but
powerful
and
perfume
the
taste
is
complex
sweet
warming
and
spicy
fruit
is
very
present
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
have
identified
cider
exceptional
smoothness
and
just
a
touch
of
warmth
exceptional
o
a
very
good
beer
that
is
an
interesting
take
on
the
witbier
style
pick
it
up
pours
straw
yellow
pretty
clear
with
a
two
finger
bubbly
head
smell
is
amazing
begian
wheat
sweet
slight
malt
the
taste
is
also
starts
with
predominant
belgian
yeast
plenty
of
apple
but
not
in
a
sweet
way
the
cayenne
is
also
pleaseny
present
at
the
end
the
after
taste
is
dry
cinnamon
apple
this
beer
isnt
as
sweet
as
i
expected
and
the
texture
was
thicker
than
i
figured
it
would
be
this
is
a
great
dinner
beer
but
youd
be
understandably
deceived
if
you
wanted
to
sip
this
on
a
90
degree
day
reminded
me
a
lot
of
a
more
complex
fruitier
slightly
lighter
version
of
birra
etrusca
on
tap
at
easy
tiger
in
austin
honestly
a
bit
pricey
for
a
dogfish
beer
but
it
turned
out
nicely
poured
in
a
wine
glass
golden
with
a
small
head
big
pear
and
apple
aroma
with
some
funky
yeast
and
spice
sweet
honey
pear
flavor
with
prickly
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
mediumlight
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
a
nice
beer
750
ml
bottle
served
in
a
dfh
signature
glass
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
about
an
inch
and
a
half
frothy
offwhite
head
head
retention
is
excellent
and
theres
a
good
amount
of
lacing
aroma
is
fruity
and
spicy
the
brew
smells
like
apples
sweet
and
tart
peppery
spice
bananas
straw
grainy
malt
pears
and
cilantro
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
theres
also
grape
cloves
and
some
very
light
cayenne
noticeable
the
aroma
and
taste
reminds
me
more
of
a
tripel
because
of
the
fruit
and
yeast
mouthfeelbody
is
medium
its
a
bit
creamy
and
is
well
carbonated
the
soft
carbonation
helps
make
this
brew
easy
to
drink
also
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
i
think
its
a
good
overall
brew
definitely
worth
a
try
m
spry
mediumbodied
crisp
shit
i
was
worried
id
never
see
this
stuff
then
bam
here
it
is
ontap
at
nellies
it
pours
a
lightlyhazy
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
honey
cranberry
white
grape
chili
pepper
and
apples
theres
a
fairly
random
mixture
for
ya
eh
at
least
its
good
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
with
more
white
grape
the
pepper
has
taken
on
more
of
a
currycumin
character
and
some
flowers
enter
the
picture
for
the
sake
of
it
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
sortakinda
gellike
feel
overall
a
decidedly
interesting
beer
one
that
showcases
the
versatility
of
apples
in
brewing
and
the
possibilities
of
sheer
randomness
poured
a
clearish
gold
body
with
two
finger
head
that
slowly
receeds
and
left
plenty
of
lace
i
pick
up
citric
notes
and
yeast
as
well
as
some
peppery
spice
but
also
get
some
type
of
apple
like
sweetness
which
i
guess
is
the
cider
and
there
is
a
slight
sweet
malt
aroma
as
well
this
kind
of
reminded
me
less
of
a
wit
and
more
of
a
belgian
pale
only
because
the
citric
twang
and
spicey
zip
i
associate
with
those
brews
is
not
as
pronounced
as
one
would
normally
find
in
a
wit
they
are
in
there
but
theres
also
some
plush
juicy
and
tropical
fruit
notes
and
some
sugary
malt
sweetness
as
well
beer
is
lighttomedium
bodied
creamy
at
times
and
sharp
at
others
thanks
to
carbonation
and
the
abv
is
wellhidden
low
b
rauls
brother
ordered
this
not
knowing
what
it
was
he
poured
half
out
to
me
and
i
sure
wish
that
he
didnt
rauls
like
yeah
he
gets
it
but
like
a
floozy
wearing
wedges
he
wishes
that
he
didnt
get
it
that
is
its
palatable
and
like
a
girl
in
wedges
he
wont
turn
it
away
but
also
like
said
hoochie
raul
wishes
that
this
beer
could
just
put
some
stilettos
on
very
intense
for
a
wit
couldnt
drink
more
than
a
glass
still
very
well
crafted
and
flavorful
apple
flavor
comes
off
differently
than
expected
not
as
cidery
as
one
would
think
just
wish
there
was
less
alcohol
for
a
more
enjoyable
summer

of
apples

with
nice
carbonation
that
fades
quickly
small
bubbles
no
lacing
some
we
wheatyness
with
orange
pepper
and
a
mild
sweet
aftertaste
overall
an
imperial
saison
style
with
a
nice
mouth
feel
and
a
small
uniqueness
cool
but
not
over
interesting
a
good
brew
perfect
for
the
up
coming
summer
hazy
gold
color
with
a
small
creamy
looking
head
aromas
of
pear
and
apple
joined
by
floral
herbal
spicy
qualities
spicy
estery
fruit
sweet
yeasty
flavors
of
apple
herbs
dried
banana
flowers
pepper
coriander
and
clove
a
little
more
hefe
than
wit
a
little
heat
in
the
throat
and
smooth
bodied
an
interesting
experience
but
its
one
and
done
for
me
overall
coming
into
this
brew
i
would
say
i
had
some
doubts
considering
ive
recently
had
bad
experiences
with
dogfish
heads
rotating
specialty
beers
but
i
was
taken
aghast
this
beer
actually
was
quite
delicious
the
witbier
category
is
well
represented
a
mix
of
the
wheat
and
bitter
of
the
spices
and
even
the
cider
is
added
with
a
slight
bitterness
works
well
its
wellbalanced
the
body
is
quite
nicely
put
together
i
would
totally
have
this
beer
again
and
would
recommend
it
to
a
friend

i
can
drink
by
myself
with

or
with
food
its
a
triple
threat
great
tasting
complex
and
drinkable
you
cant
hate
on
that
toward
the

i
paired
it

im
diggin
the
combo
it
works
together
so
nicely
its
a
wonderfully
beautiful
beer
with
its
abv
its
dangerously
drinkable
no
sense
of
the
alcohol
so
delicious
o
loved
this
beer
though
a
tad
pricey
imo
but
damn
good
never
the
less
a
good
beer
for
the
spring
time
this
would
be
the
recent
batch
2
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
shaker
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
yellowgold
coloring
and
a
fluffy
white
tall
bright
head
that
leaves
a
cling
all
over
the
glass
as
it
slowly
recedes
settles
in
a
solid
half
an
inch
aromas
of
all
spice
cinnamon
subtle
apple
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
cloves
flavors
are
smooth
and
light
with
a
cider
sweet
backbone
and
subtle
pepper
spicing
very
light
and
very
well
balanced
the
all
spice
and
clove
become
highlighting
accents
instead
of
main
characteristics
very
light
crisp
clean
body
the
finish
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
spice
great
balance
to
a
very
unique
brew
tasty
light
and
hugely
refreshing
o
world
class
must
try
overall
yes
i
think
the
overall
warrants
a
higher
than
any
individual
score
the
experimentation
warrants
kudos
to
dogfish
and
keep
at
it
hazy
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
large
cap
of
foamy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
ringlet
leaving
a
few
dots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
fairly
typical
wheat
profile
on
the
nose
with
notes
of
apple
and
grape
taste
of
toasted
wheat
sweet
apple
cider
subtle
grape
and
yeast
flavors
herbal
hops
i
didnt
really
get
any
pepper
characteristics
at
all
lightmedium
body
decent
overall
but
not
too
memorable
the
most
notable
thing
here
is
the
spicy
finish
its
warm
and
complements
the
lighter
flavor
of
the
rest
of
the
beer
very
well
its
flavorful
but
doesnt
go
out
of
its
way
to
be
an
experience
outside
of
the
transition
from
the
light
fruit
hints
to
the
spice
at
the
finish
all
in
all
a
good
one
trick
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
any
time
good
for
all
occassions
another
offcenteredale
from
dfh
o
considering
its
strength
this
beer
is
rather
easy
to
drink
because
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
from
the
taste
o
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
like
others
in
the
style
but
the
imperial
nature
of
it
makes
the
hidden
alcohol
all
the
more
impressive
there
is
just
a
hint
of
hefeweizen
likely
due
to
the
yeast
which
contributes
the
very
light
notes
of
bananacove
d
not
bad
it
is
a
bit
much
at
first
but
grows
on
me
as
i
drink
it
and
halfway
through
the
glass
it
has
become
a
spicy
fairly
complex
belgian
golden
type
beer
overall
definitely
weird
as
expected
reminded
me
a
lot
of
cheap
packaged
fruit
cocktail
with
belgian
character
glad
stores
decided
to
brake
these
6
packs
up
despite
the
threats
clear
orange
white
head
with
ok
retention
and
some
lacing
nose
has
lots
of
wheat
green
banana
some
cider
character
and
orange
rind
cayenne
is
super
subtle
wouldnt
have
picked
it
out
had
it
not
been
on
the
label
taste
has
banana
wheat
spice
on
the
back
toasty
malts
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
in
the
finish
some
texture
on
the
palate
medium
body
good
enough
as
an
imperial
wit
but
as
with
most
of
these
dfh
collab
beers
i
struggle
to
pick
out
any
of
these
crazy
ingredients
bitter
ending
nice
carbonation
i
expected
to
get
more
from
the
cayenne
and
cilantro
but
might
not
have
because
of
the
beers
age
o
i
think
i
like
this
better
now
than
when
i
had
a
sample
of
it
fresh
cilantro
is
gone
and
the
spices
have
blended
with
the
cider
to
make
this
a
smoother
easier
to
drink
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
of
this
style
i
bought
it
on
sale
and
im
glad
i
did
i
felt
the
flavors
didnt
mesh
well
and
it
was
off
for
its
style
taste
is
quite
cidery
with
a
mild
yeasty
wheat
bite
at
the
end
the
pepper
is
pretty
tame
and
i
wouldnt
have
noticed
it
if
i
didnt
know
it
was
there
the
cilantro
is
a
bit
of
an
enigma
as
the
flavors
are
incorporated
nicely
and
i
do
get
a
bit
of
vegetal
stemyness
the
coriander
is
omnipresent
and
is
about
the
only
thing
holding
this
beer
withinthe
witbier
category
alcohol
is
a
bit
high
and
overall
the
beer
is
just
kind
of
fruitycidery
the
flavors
are
pretty
well
integrated
thoough
and
is
an
interesting
pour
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
doublewit
style
so
take
that
for
what
its
worth
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
hides
the
9
quite
well
good
value
considering
i
picked
up
for
8
79
it
was
mislabeled
o
if
this
was
cheaper
i
would
buy
this
again
its
a
truely
interesting
and
tasty
experiment
by
dogfish
head
but
the
price
is
quite
high
it
throws
a
couple
of
strange
ingredients
together
and
manages
to
balance
them
well
and
get
the
flavors
they
wanted
out
of
them
theres
a
room
at
dogfish
head
where
they
roll
the
big
dice
comin
up
cilantro
apples
cayenne
it
is
some
kind
of
fruit
punch
mixed
with
v8
juice
from
the
30th
century
but
i
have
to
admit
it
is
very
tasty
and
intriguing
once
of
the
better
df
concoctions
hazy
pale
gold
with
some
floaters
in
the
glass
along
with
huge
white
head
and
tons
of
lace
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
yeast
which
even
a
slow
pour
wouldnt
leave
in
the
bottle
the
smell
is
quite
typical
of
a
goodgreat
belgian
golden
ale
with
the
peppery
spiciness
which
is
backed
by
lemon
and
clean
wheat
bready
character
the
additions
of
cider
cilantro
and
cayenne
may
be
just
noticeable
in
the
smell
but
they
are
subtle
the
taste
too
is
all
belgian
ale
with
some
additions
first
you
are
hit
by
lemon
and
pepper
this
is
followed
by
great
pale
malt
biscuit
and
warming
alcohol
characteristics
the
cider
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
fruity
esters
of
the
yeast
and
maybe
it
is
just
because
ive
read
the
label
and
im
looking
for
it
but
it
does
seem
as
though
the
pepper
and
cilantro
are
also
evident
but
only
just
and
again
to
add
an
additional
layer
of
complexity
to
a
beer
that
is
already
quite
impressive
the
carbonation
is
relatively
high
and
the
peppery
tingle
makes
this
beer
quite
lively
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
great
twist
on
a
great
style
using
some
interesting
ingredients
proving
again
that
the
guys
and
dfh
have
redefined
what
brewing
and
beer
can
be
o
overall
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
with
nice
witbier
aspects
the
cayenne
doesnt
really
work
with
this
beet
though
bit
of
alcohol
heat
but
its
pretty
well
hidden
for
such
a
strong
wit
dont
buy
again
o
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
and
drinks
easy
not
your
average
witbier
and
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
good
balance
of
flavors
with
a
nice
complexity
good
enough
but
lacks
the
followthrough
you
might
expect
from
the
description
at
times
it
drinks
more
like
a
belgian
pale
than
a
witbier
o
this
was
an
interested
beer
that
was
just
right
for
a
cool
fall
afternoon
it
had
many
ciderlike
qualities
from
the
light
body
and
apple
sweetness
and
the
slight
belgian
yeast
funk
and
the
touch
of
spice
added
a
nice
twist
this
was
definitely
a
different
and
offcenter
beer
it
is
not
a
must
try
but
it
is
still
pretty
darn
good
overall
pretty
solid
for
a
witbier
it
could
be
a
tripel
but
still
tasty
one
way
or
another
overall
a
nice
addition
to
the
dogfish
head
lineup
this
has
an
ancient
ale
feel
but
mostly
its
just
a
tasty
beverage
and
definitely
remains
a
beer

spices
but
not
necessarily
cayenne
in
the
nose
not
really
getting
any
cilantro
either
it
does
smell
inviting
though
taste
is
quite
complex
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
initially
i
get
a

followed
by
floral

yeasty

with
a

off

apples
and
a

the
cayenne

make
their
appearance

but
very
subtle
there
is
a
hint
of
booziness
but
nothing
you
would
expect
from
a

by
this
beer
i
went
into
this
thinking
it
was
simply
a
gimmick
and
would
not

good
i
only

it

smooth
on

end
on
the

end
there
is
a
pop
of
fruit
flavor
maybe
enhanced
by
cayenne
on
the
tongue
although
cayenne
not
specifically
notable
great
brew
this
is
not
your
typical
summer
wheat
beer
so
much
more
complex
with
a
nice
heat
in
the

that
works
well
around
an

really
enjoyed

recommend
and
another
good
outing
from
dogfish
available
here
in

rotation
i
can
see
getting
several
bottles
per
year
its
says
its
a
rotating
release
so
not
sure
how
often
it
will
be
available
tap
for
sure
might
be
a
good
beer
to
share
with
craft
newbies
as
well
o
when
i
saw
this
beer
i
was
completely
unaware
it
was
a
part
of
dogfish
heads
musicinspired
series
i
simply
picked
up
the
beer
because
it
seemed
like
an
interesting
list
of
ingredients
although
skeptical
of
the
cidercilantro
mix
i
will
say
that
it
worked
in
a
rather
pleasing
fashion
dfh
did
a
good
job
making
the
ingredients
of
this
beer
work
together
which
made
for
a
interesting
deviation
from
the
norm
i
enjoyed
the
experience
but
at
10
a
bomber
this
was
definitely
a
one
time
thing
o
if
this
beer
were
only
a
few
bucks
id
recommend
it
in
a
heartbeat
however
at
10
please
choose
your
future
beers
wisely

the

was

the

was
of

banana
apple

wheat
it
had

on

this

hmmm
this
is
a
big
bottle
of
woodchuck
wait
shit
this
isnt
my
woodchuck
cider
but
seriously
im
not
really
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
but
the
rest
of
the
beer
helped
to
carry
it
through
as
a
decent
representative
for
the
style
not
sure
if
i
would
drink
this
one
again
though
and
i
really
feel
sorry
for
those
who
bought
a
case
of
these
unless
you
only
wanted
the
vinyl
collection
o
i
was
really
impressed
by
this
beer
i
do
get
the
fuji
apple
cider
but
the
cayenne
and
cilantro
are
really
hidden
still
makes
for
a
crazy
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
call
me
crazy
but
a
six
pack
of
these
along
with
some
awesome
music
sounds
perfect
an
interesting
beer
the
different
ingredients
come
together
quite
nicely
o
if
you
like
belgian
yeast
and
the
like
youll
love
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
a
nice
lemon
flavor
added
to
it
to
make
a
good
beer
o
the
addition
of
cider
to
this
beer
doesnt
do
too
much
to
change
it
which
i
like
dfh
usually
does
a
nice
job
imparting
the
flavor
of
a
different
type
of
drink
while
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
base
beer
also
in
cases
such
as
red
white
and
noble
rot
with
the
wine
characteristics
and
that
stays
true
here
i
really
like
the
complexity
and
depth
as
well
nice
job
o
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
flavors
is
very
delicious
and
blows
me

is
an
interesting
beer
ive
come
to
expect
no
less
from
dogfish
head
its
good
beer
but
its
not
great
beer
the
alcohol
flavor
comes
through
a
little
too
strong
and
it
just
seems
too
big
for
the
style
definitely
worth
checking
out
though
pours
a
crisp
lightclear
golden
with
good
foamy
head
although
it
is
gone
quick
leaving
a
thin
ring
of
head
smell
is
really
refreshing
belgian
meets
german
hefe
banana
clove
and
fruity
apple
aromas
taste
is
really
nice
banana
and
clove
again
the
fruit
is
subtle
but
present
and
leaves
a
bit
of
heat
from
the
cayenne
pepper
in
the
finish
its
refreshing
and
easy
overall
its
a
great
brew
and
deff
worth
seeking
out
especially
if
you
are
a
wit
fan
although
i
dont
think
id
ever
buy
it
as
they
intend
a
six
pack
of
bombers
for
70
i
got
mine
illegally
as
a
solo
bottle
overall
this
was
a
nice
beer
but
i
feel
the
heftabv
hindered
the
enjoyability
and
drinkability
of
this
beer
beers
of
this
style
arent
meant
to
be
this
viscous
and
heavy
on
the
palate
drinks
more
like
a
wheat
wine
than
a
witbier
regardless
i
was
glad
to
sample
on
draft
over
having
to
take
the
plunge
and
consume
a
whole
750ml
o
pretty
intersting
beer
overall
and
was
tasty
as
well
i
thought
it
was
worth
the
try
the
overall
effortless
in
drinkability
of
this
imperial
witbier
is
remarkably
clean
refreshing
and
crisp
despite
its
high
alcohol
values
and
the
seemingly
challenged
spices
and
fruit
added
to
the
brew
but
the
premiere
restraint
of
these
additions
give
the
finished
beer
added
layers
of
complexity
without
disrupting
the
balance
of
the
witbiers
that
we
know
and
love
those
additions
inform
the
usual
taste
but
without
quite
being
able
to
pinpoint
its
source
putting
those
additions
on
the
label
takes
much
of
the
fun
out
of
it
for
me
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
tulip
glass
in
2012
this
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
golden
color
with
a
massive
tight
bubbled
white
head
which
has
good
retention
and
a
slight
lacing
the
smells
are
of
belgian
yeast
esters
some
banana
apple
coriander
the
feel
is
medium
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
different
some
apple
pepper
coriander
spices
well
i
was
expecting
more
of
a
cider
not
an
average
wheat
beer
love
the
color
and
fast
rising
bubbles
the
was
acutally
head
rentention
i
was
like
thats
amazing
for
a
cider
aromas
were
weak
some
fruit
aromas
and
some
earthy
spice
the
taste
was
disappointing
cilantro
added
to
the
bitterness
zero
sweetness
and
no
to
little
apple
flavor
loved
the
cayenne
kick
well
balanced
heat
but
the
body
and
flavor
of
the
base
beer
was
weak
and
the
cider
aspect
just
wasnt
there
this
was
nice
paired
up
with
some
fish
and
veggies
but
not
my
favorite
dfh
brew
i
guess
expectations
can
ruin
your
thught
process
i
was
expecting
a
spicy
cider
overall
a
complex
brew
but
i
was
surprised
the
cider
character
wasnt
more
prevalent
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
very
complex
and
fun
beer
to
drink
like
many
a
dfh
ancient
golden
ale
i
immediately
though
midas
touch
when
i
initially
saw
smelled
and
tasted
positive
contact
however
this
9
abv
hybrid
combines
the
refreshing
tartness
of
a
cider
with
the
complexity
of
an
imperial
wit
very
much
recommend
pairing
this
with
bbq
that
has
some
kick
really
interesting
really
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
try
at
a
belgian
but
lets
face
it
nobody
does
it
better
than
the
belgians
slightly
cloudy
golden
straw
color
with
a
white
head
aroma
has
a
nice
belgian
character
to
it
of
banana
mild
coriander
spiciness
and
yeast
fruity
apple
character
with
a
touch
of
grass
and
white
pepper
the
coriander
and
yeast
are
more
pronounced
on
the
palate
light
apple
flavor
decently
fruity
banana
a
bit
of
grass
bread
and
a
light
herbaceous
quality
not
bad
but
kind
of
watery
o
this
isnt
halfbad
but
dont
know
that
id
necessarily
do
another
4
0
d
another
winner
from
dfh
though
like
most
of
their
offerings
this
is
too
expensive
to
justify
another
purchase
definitely
worth
a
try
though
an
interesting
and
original
beer
from
dogfish
head
personally
fruitvegetable
beer
would
be
a
better
style
because
this
doesnt
quite
work
as
a
witbier
o
yeasty
and
spicy
hard
to
pickup
any
specific
flavors
o
overall
pretty
unique
brew
nothing
terrible
but
not
outstanding
either
o
a
nice
sipping
beer
9
alcohol
by
volume
very
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
o
a
nice
beer
i
wish
the
cider
had
more
effect
aka
new
glarus
apple
ale
but
this
is
certainly
a
nice
beer
the
cost
is
a
problem
but
i
did
enjoy
this
effort
had
on
tap
at
boulvards
in
johnstown
pa
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
fruity
nose
to
it
it
is
essentially
a
high
powered
heffe
medium
bodied
nice
mouthfeel
actually
dont
get
too
much
of
a
cider
taste
at
all
but
just
a
well
balanced
tasty
brew
with
an
assortment
of
fruity
flavors
and
hops
surprisingly
smooth
finishes
clean
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
was
try
it
out
if
you
can
bottle
its
innovative
experimental
and
a
redefinition
of
a
spiced
wit
yet
remains
somewhat
familiar
with
its
cider
qualities
and
is
a
great
drink
very
good
worth
grabbing
d
very
drinkable
surprisingly
well
balanced
and
the
combination
of
witbier
and
cider
works
nicely
overall
not
bad
interesting
flavors
but
a
bit
too
much
going
on
the
hint
of
cayenne
at
the
back
is
a
nice
touch
but
with
so
much
else
going
on
none
of
it
really
seems
to
go
together
perfectly
either
drinkability
one
of
the
stand
out
beers
in
dfhs
portfolio
the
best
of
the
music
inspired
series
since
bitches
brew
this
beer
is
really
enjoyable
because
of
how
at
one
minute
you
taste
those
fruity
cider
properties
then
all
of
a
sudden
you
get
that
peppery
yeasty
beer
quality
to
bring
you
back
down
to
the
ground
outside
of
the
box
is
a
understatement
for
this
beer
and
i
also
liked
that
sam
toned
down
the
sweetness
on
this
to
make
it
more
drinkable
without
too
much
alcohol
burn
in
the
finish
excellent
beer
all
around
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
foamy
bone
colored
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
spices
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
very
fruity
flavor
and
the
spice
flavors
coming
through
more
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
nice
fresh
aromas
and
flavors
that
make
it
easy
to
drink
overall
i
cant
say
im
really
enjoying
this
beer
its
not
awful
or
anything
but
theres
no
reason
i
would
buy
another
bottle
i
just
dont
think
all
the
elements
are
working
together
so
am
i
really
going
to
do
this
yeah
im
knocking
a
dogfish
brew
for
being
too
standard
way
too
standard
actually
reading
the
label
got
my
excited
apple
cider
cilantro
cayanne
pepper
this
is
going
to
be
a
blast
instead
its
just
a
slightly
fruity
witbier
with
a
tiny
bit
of
pepper
heat
on
the
finish
gotta
say
i
expected
more
from
this
one
its
still
a
good
beer
but
come
into
it
expecting
a
pretty
standard
witbier
its
not
nearly
as
crazy
as
you
might
expect
from
reading
the
label
theres
only
a
touch
of
dogfish
weirdness
here
oa
decent
beer
one
of
the
few
with
apples
ive
enjoyed
although
the
case
with
the
vinyl
was
a
silly
idea
glad
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
single
t
opens
with
a
lot
of
spicy
malt
flavor
cinnamon
belgian
yeast
clove
and
some
faint
apple
cider
with
a
drying
finish
of
white
pepper
faint
cayenne
heat
and
some
golden
delicious
apple
skins
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
shows
just
a
hint
of
the
abv
nicely
done
very
drinkable
careful
now
so
many
layers
to
this
brew
you
think
youve
tasted
it
all
until
you
take
your
next
sip
and
then
it
peels
away
another
flavor
or
goes
back
to
one
you
tasted
on
your
first
sip
a
lot
of
fun
drinking
this
beer
thanks
dfh
note
the
cayenne
heat
crept
up
a
lot
later
it
made
my
stomach
warm
up
a
lot
but
not
uncomfortably
my
only
real
wish
is
slightly
more
apple
taste
even
though
i
know
they
stepped
it
up
and
considerably
more
cilantro
taste
but
not
enough
to
be
overpowering
overall
though
it
was
very
good
overall
i
would
recommend
this
as
a
summer
beer
and
i
would
pick
up
a
second
bottle
if
it
wasnt
soo
limited
o
another
good
release
from
dfh
its
something
i
could
enjoy
a
whole
bottle
if
i
see
another
ill
probably
pick
one
up
i
guess
i
can
taste
some
of
the
apples
but
not
the
cilantro
or
the
chayenne
pepper
it
tastes
like
a
witbier
and
a
grainy
witbier
at
that
not
a
favorite
not
a
repeat
9
witbiers
are
never
my
idea
of
a
good
time
especially
the
ones
that
dogfish
head
puts
out
but
positive
contact
is
lovely
complex
and
versatile
and
boundarycrossing
this
beer
can
be
enjoyed
by
many
o
this
beer
is
pretty
much
as
advertised
a
apple
ciderbeer
combo
its
pretty
good
but
i
dont
know
if
i
would
seek
this
beer
out
its
definitely
fun
to
have
tried
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
glass
pours
golden
amber
with
two
finger
fine
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
massive
lacing
aroma
of
wheat
coriander
sweet
malt
and
belgian
yeast
smells
nice
flavor
is
delicious
integrated
malt
wheat
sweet
cider
finishes
slightly
hot
cayenne
and
lightly
hopped
spicing
is
present
but
not
assertive
perfectly
balanced
and
tasty
nice
medium
to
heavy
creamy
body
i
liked
this
more
as
the
second
glass
slowly
warmed
the
only
negative
is
that
the
alcohol
in
this
9
beer
is
well
hidden
its
way
too
quaffable
i
sincerely
hope
that
dfh
makes
this
beer
again
the
taste
is
a
pretty
enjoyable
combination
of
wheat
flavor
with
cider
blend
and
the
subtle
vegetal
herbal
flavor
comes
out
in
tertiary
with
a
taste
of
light
alcohol
and
subtle
pepper
that
augments
the
yeast
flavor
with
mild
cilantro
adding
the
taste
the
cider
is
pretty
dry
and
harder
to
pick
up
to
me
with
slight
appleskin
tannin
which
leads
to
the
mild
cayenne
flavor
with
subtle
heat
on
the
palate
overall
a
good
beer
and
interesting
concept
i
would
have
liked
this
better
without
the
cider
perhaps
it
seems
a
little
muted
but
worth
a
try
for
sure
as
it
stands
apart
as
an
original
wheat
that
being
said
i
drank
the
second
half
after
having
a
decent
amount
of
habanero
hot
sauce
and
it
actually
improved
the
taste
a
lot
id
be
interested
to
hear
if
others
agree
with
that
bottom
lineyou
gotta
try
this
its
special
overall
this
is
a
fairly
weird
beer
im
not
sure
that
it
needed
the
spice
in
the
finish
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
wouldnt
pick
up
another
bottle
kinda
straddles
the
definition
between
wit
and
tripel
at
9
and
its
good
nothing
about
it
is
bizarre
but
its
well
balanced
considering
the
ingredients
the
taste
is
just
as
announced
on
the
label
very
drinkable
beer
with
good
carbonation
for
originality
of
brewing
i
give
it
a
4
5
overall
overall
a
nice
albeit
expensive
summer
brew
refreshing
and
clean
dangerously
hides
alcohol
amount
wish
the
cayenne
and
apple
were
a
little
more
prominent
pours
a
hazy
dark
gold
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
think
cap
and
some
sudsy
bubbles
smells
like
a
witbier
maybe
a
bit
of
apple
cider
and
cilantro
but
mainly
just
a
bananaforward
wit
yeast
bland
taste
is
similarly
dominated
by
a
wit
yeast
lots
of
banana
and
clove
a
touch
of
apple
and
grassy
herbs
not
getting
any
of
the
cayenne
tastes
like
namaste
with
some
apple
smooth
mouthfeel
fairly
creamy
with
a
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
overall
a
pretty
bland
uninspired
beer
that
tastes
like
any
other
dogfish
beer
overall
a
great
beer
the
style
says
itbier
but
it
honestly
drinks
more
like
a
saison
either
way
its
delicious
and
a
very
nice
summer
ale
o
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
this
a
wheat
beer
with
subtle
apple
character
and
a
load
of
spice
particularly
belgian
yeast
spice
which
really
dominates
this
brew
maybe
enjoyable
to
some
but
not
me
o
i
have
a
hard
time
understating
how
much
i
appreciate
this
beer
i
am
not
just
saying
this
because
delton
3030
is
probably
my
favorite
album
of
all
time
and
the
fact
that
i
am
anxiously
awaiting
3030
the
return
in
september
assuming
the
time
frame
is
kept
i
am
really
saying
it
because
this
beer
is
very
well
done
the
yeast
is
not
obnoxiously
strong
the
beer
is
not
too
overdone
in
any
one
area
of
apple
cilantro
or
cayenne
and
these
flavors
are
all
distinctly
different
which
makes
this
beer
very
good
in
my
book
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
4
beers
that
i
have
left
of
this
very
well
done
dfh
o
a
very
interesting
beer
the
apple
and
citrus
is
complimented
well
by
the
spice
of
the
pepper
i
was
surprised
at
how
creamy
the
beer
is
i
was
expecting
crisp
it
reminds
me
of
the
heavier
cider
without
alcohol
i
buy
in
the
fall
the
flavors
are
subtle
rather
than
aggressive
which
is
not
always
the
case
for
dogfish
head
beers
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
o
one
of
the
more
interesting
versions
of
a
witbier
ive
tried
recently
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
good
beer
and
represents
the
masterful
blending
of
strange
ingredients
typical
of
dogfish
heads
brews
the
results
is
a
nicely
balanced
beverage
that
bears
only
slight
reminders
of
the
9
abv
and
includes
an
excellent
series
of
fruit
and
spice
flavors
the
tail
end
of
the
aftertaste
is
strange
and
in
some
ways
unpleasant
marking
one
of
the
beers
few
weaknesses
still
this
is
worth
trying
o
i
bought
dfh
positive
contact
as
part
of
the
distributed
6750ml
bottle
case
and
i
am
not
at
all
disappointed
with
the
finished
product
as
with
many
dfh
beers
it
is
not
overly
complex
in
any
way
and
is
a
very
refreshing
summer
brew
as
a
bonus
this
onetime
production
beer
has
an
interesting
story
behind
it
and
how
it
was
created
and
makes
for
a
good
conversation
o
pretty
good
fairly
refreshing
on
this
hot
day
but
perhaps
a
little
too
sweet
to
love
or
session
for
me
im
a
big
fan
of
belgians
and
this
one
while
outside
the
box
has
its
roots
in
a
solid
witbier
oim
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
here
beer
it
has
just
an
off
quality
to
it
the
flavors
really
really
dont
mesh
together
well
at
all
considering
everything
that
went
into
this
beer
i
thought
the
flavor
profile
a
bit
simple
and
one
dimensional
though
enjoyable
still
a
nice
beer
but
just
not
worth
the
price
tag
and
hassle
of
obtaining
imho
o
a
pretty
decent
and
unique
beer
the
apple
and
spice
notes
are
pleasant
i
have
two
bottles
of
this
beer
and
will
try
pairig
the
next
with
some
indian
food
to
help
accentuate
the
hidden
spices
the
body
is
a
wit
all
the
way
slightly
cloudy
light
yellow
body
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
is
well
disappointing
at
best
i
get
a
slightly
sweet
wit
not
spices
or
adjuncts
at
all
the
taste
kind
of
follows
suit
no
real
heat
from
the
cayenne
no
herbal
notes
from
the
cilantro
but
i
do
get
a
crisp
feeling
from
the
cider
that
makes
it
clean
highlight
of
the
beer
for
sure
its
super
drinkable
for
9
another
interesting
experiment
from
dogfish
head
i
love
trying
their
unique
beers
and
this
one
was
decent
nothing
in
it
makes
it
amazing
but
its
not
bad
either
quite
different
but
i
was
hoping
more
of
the
apple
cider
qualities
were
here
i
bought
an
extra
bottle
to
experiment
with
the
record
cover
comes
with
recipes
printed
on
it
from
top
notch
chefs
e
g
mario
batali
sean
paxton
david
chang
o
im
a
dfh
fan
these
guys
make
really
good
and
interesting
beer
and
i
totally
recommend
this
but
that
said
not
being
familiar
with
witbiers
or
ciders
for
that
matter
i
dont
know
how
this
beer
may
be
received
by
folks
coming
in
with
a
set
of
expectations
i
didnt
possess
feel
is
a
nice
medium
any
more
this
may
have
been
a
chore
to
take
down
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
intrusion
there
is
a
warming
quality
this
beer
is
not
bitter
at
all
hops
dont
really
come
into
play
but
i
assume
they
are
holding
this
one
together
as
of
now
because
once
they
fade
this
will
get
on
the
sweet
side
o
good
solid
beer
really
interesting
flavors
and
very
tasty
o
i
was
expecting
bigger
things
from
this
as
i
had
waited
about
4you
months
to
this
be
released
and
distributed
would
definitely
drink
this
again
though
as
i
feel
this
has
grown
on
me
as
i
neared
the
end
of
the
bottle
m
medium
bodied
carboed
nicely
o
another
good
beer
from
dfh
i
feel
the
9
abv
is
well
hidden
and
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
the
apples
really
add
to
the
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
more
apple
forward
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
carbonation
being
high
but
delicate
overall
it
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
really
liked
the
apple
flavors
to
it
and
they
balanced
out
the
sweet
juiciness
of
them
pretty
well
it
was
actually
a
lot
more
normal
then
i
anticipated
given
the
ingredient
list
which
is
probably
a
good
thing
o
it
wouldnt
be
a
dfh
beer
if
it
wasnt
weird
and
polarizing
having
said
that
though
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
better
limited
releases
in
their
recent
portfolio
there
seems
to
have
been
some
actual
thought
and
care
put
into
this
beer
and
it
shows
im
sure
some
will
hate
this
and
ill
totally
understand
if
they
do
but
for
my
palate
this
oneoff
was
pretty
respectable
a
continuing
sign
that
things
seem
to
slowly
be
on
the
upswing
at
delewares
most
popular
brewery
had
on
tap
at
maxs
in
baltimore
in
a
tulip
glass
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
fruity
nose
to
it
listed
as
a
hybrid
cider
beer
worries
me
a
bit
medium
bodied
nice
mouthfeel
actually
dont
get
too
much
of
a
cider
taste
at
all
but
just
a
well
balanced
tasty
brew
with
an
assortment
of
fruity
flavors
and
hops
surprisingly
smooth
finishes
clean
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
good
this
beer
was
try
it
out
if
you
can
i
have
to
say
i
did
not
know
what
to
expect
with
this
one
from
reading
the
label
but
its
really
good
inventiveness
has
never
been
a
problem
for
dfh
but
execution
sometimes
is
this
one
is
a
real
winner
though
just
a
joy
to
drink
i
need
to
grab
another
and
hold
onto
it
before
they
run
out
overall
just
a
really
good
beer
interesting
ingredient
choices
and
it
came
out
alright
i
was
lucky
enough
to
be
at
the
brewery
on
the
day
they
released
this
and
im
excited
that
it
i
had
the
opportunity
to
try
this
second
batch
before
most
good
stuff
dfh
as
always
keep
it
up
o
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
the
nose
is
a
little
spicy
and
smokey
but
the
taste
is
great
and
full
of
apples
would
like
to
have
it
again
overall
as
the
description
said
it
is
a
bit
cider
like
and
it
certainly
was
mildy
refreshing
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
touch
of
sweet
and
tart
apple
aromas
to
it
with
some
spice
notes
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
gives
off
the
minimal
tartness
of
the
apple
used
with
the
mixture
of
spices
added
to
give
this
brew
some
character
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
dry
with
a
decent
carbonation
to
it
overall
this
beer
wasnt
much
of
a
witbier
in
my
opinion
but
still
was
drinkable
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
one
again
someday
o
a
different
take
on
a
witbier
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
normal
offerings
at
dfh
serving
type
ontap
o
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
really
good
beer
thecpj
overall
a
rather
decent
and
refreshingly
balanced
wit
rather
well
done
and
an
easy
drinker
at
only
4
8
m
quite
a
high
carbonation
level
with
a
sharp
crisp
finish

very
well
balanced
taste
with
a
reasonable
body
may
prove
a
wee
bit
heavy
texturewise
for
the
long
haul
but
if
you
want
a
kick
starter
for
a
nonschool
night
you
could
do
worse
than
to
start
here
ill
be
back
white
foamy
head
some
lacing
around
the
top
of
the
glass
hazy
pale
yellow
in
color
very
light
aroma
of
coriander
and
the
orange
peel
taste
is
somewhat
underwhelming
compared
to
the
smell
of
the
coriander
and
oranges
crisp
light
on
the
palette
really
nice
in
the
summer
as
it
is
very
drinkable
high
carbonation
nice
mouth
feel
dry
and
grainy
finishes
nicely
with
a
tad
of
bitterness
o
i
like
this
one
but
i
think
theres
slightly
too
much
citrus
i
wouldnt
recommend
adding
any
additional
slices
of
orange
or
lemon
still
a
great
beer

pours

a
very
slight

massive

and

very
nice
belgian
nose
of

orange
and
yeast
with
a
slight

light
medium

with
a
smooth
texture
that
has
some
creamy
feel
to
it
as
well
slightly
above
normal
carbonation
that
yields
a
nice
effervescence
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
complex
and
well
balanced
the
flavors
of
the
nose
are
all
present
with
coriander
and
orange
being
most
prevalent
the
finish
is
crisp
with
just
a
touch
of
pepper
underlying
the
coriander
while
not
as
flavor
intensive
as
allagash
white
this
one
is
still
outstanding
d
not
a
bad
witbier
by
any
means
but
not
one
of
my
first
or
second
options
either
the
best
adjective
i
can
come
up
with
overall
is
pedestrian
average
at
best
in
most
categories
the
mouthfeel
distracts
a
bit
as
its
slightly
off
putting
however
this
one
will
serve
its
purpose
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
is
a
very
pale
moderately
clear
beer
the
head
is
enormous
and
brilliantly
white
i
expected
a
little
more
haze
in
the
brew
the
smell
is
typical
of
the
style
sweet
and
fruity
with
lots
of
citrus
and
light
herb
scents
the
smell
is
a
little
malty
notably
sweet
and
it
has
a
slightly
spice
and
earth
flavor
almost
no
bitterness
of
hop
presence
in
the
taste
very
light
in
body
its
a
refreshing
and
nice
summer
brew
but
is
overall
fairly
average
for
the
style
o
sessionable
and
flavorful
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
in
the
sea
of
witbiers
on
the
market
great
soft
wheat
flavors
that
create
a
base
for
a
spicy
witbier
eggy
body
transfers
energy
perfectly
in
the
mouth
a
solid
peppery
bite
upfront
with
the
flavors
of
coriander
in
the
finish
middle
is
jammed
with
witte
yeast
elegance
orange
peel
lemon
and
slight
grassiness
really
onpoint
especially
in
the
mouthfeel
o
decent
belgian
white
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
because
i
was
expecting
more
from
flying
dog
flying

woody

belgian

cheers
peace2all
o
there
are
a
couple
of
things
to
fix
mainly
feel
with
a
decrease
in
carbonation
but
overall
this
was
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
and
a
solid
beer
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
departments
good
but
not
quite
great
job
by
fd
o
the
sediment
turned
me
off
right
away
to
be
honest
it
had
a
decent
flavor
but
i
had
to
dump
this
one
maybe
next
time
overall
i
love
belgian
witbiers
in
the
summer
and
this
is
a
good
one
i
drank
up
my
sixpack
fairly
quickly
and
would
definitely
buy
it
again
nicely
done
chugged
the
last
few
mouthfuls
and
got
that
refreshed
feeling
again
maybe
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
best
slammed
by
the
six
pack
on
a
hot
day
after
working
outdoors
doubt
it
would
give
much
pleasure
at
all
if
the
outside
temp
was
below
70f
3
75
d
seems
like
most
breweries
who
make
a
witbier
make
it
well
and
this
is
no
exception
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
o
not
a
bad
witbier
i
find
a
lot
of
witbiers
to
be
way
too
light
but
not
this
one
not
a
ton
going
on
flavorwise
but
it
still
tasted
pretty
good
wont
rush
out
to
buy
again
but
its
a
solid
crisp
and
refreeshing
beer
oit
looked
good
and
smelled
good
it
tasted
bad
and
felt
bad
tastes
adjunct
or
amateur
or
something
just
a
large
amount
of
off
flavor
not
an
easy
drinker
wont
get
again
mf
a
refreshing
light
bodies
beer
carbonation
very
evident
on
the
tongue
overall
one
of
the
better
wits
i
can
remember
having
not
quite
on
the
level
of
allagash
white
but
its
a
force
all
its
own
will
have
to
try
again
at
some
point
down
the
road
maybe
for
a
witbier
side
by
side
competition
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
small
particles
of
sediment
are
seen
suspended
in
the
beer
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
malt
grain
yeast
and
some
subdued
spice
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
muted
fruity
citrus
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
still
tastes
fine
even
being
almost
6
months
past
the
best
before
date
at
4
8
abv
you
could
drink
these
suckers
all
day
and
be
fine
seems
like
a
good
one
to
drink
on
a
really
hot
summer
day
other
than
that
there
isnt
much
to
it
not
bad
but
nothing
too
special
either
d
aside
from
the
weird
off
flavor
it
wouldnt
be
bad
just
far
from
exceptional
fairly
large
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
on
a
cloudy
dull
golden
body
aroma
of
corriander
belgian
yeast
orange
peel
and
powder
sugar
flavor
is
pretty
mild
and
a
bit
watery
with
more
corriander
yeast
and
hint
of
lemon
and
orange
citrus
light
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
the
look
and
aroma
make
this
one
promising
but
it
was
a
little
too
watery
and
under
flavored
even
for
the
style
but
not
terrible
not
a
standout
but
this
witbier
is
solid
for
the
style
i
could
see
this
as
a
goto
summer
beer
all
that
needs
to
be
said
about
woody
creek
has
been
laid
out
above
its
a
neat
looking
zestfully
aromatic
ridiculously
agreeable
beer
thats
layered
with
a
smorgasbord
of
tastes
and
textures
and
given
the
price
point
we
can
add
affordable
to
that
list
of
pros
too
as
for
the
cons
my
only
one
is
that
this
was
the
only
bottle
in
the
house
would
go
well
with
a
light
lunch
of
salads
cheese
and
bread
on
a
hot
day
o
the
beer
is
really
refreshing
if
not
uncomplicated
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
to
it
but
then
it
wouldnt
be
as
refreshing
all
in
all
a
good
beer
but
one
i
wont
get
again
it
poured
a
clouded
pale
straw
yellow
with
another
lackluster
head
performance
no
lacing
but
it
smells
of
coriander
and
chamomile
tea
over
pale
malts
both
american
and
belgian
tastes
of
those
malts
with
a
healthy
dose
of
orange
peel
sharpness
and
just
a
little
pinch
of
bitter
at
the
finish
light
fluffy
mouthfeel
not
bad
overall
this
was
a
textbook
witbier
in
my
opinion
i
would
say
that
dfh
namaste
is
probably
a
good
comparison
here
ive
had
others
that
were
very
similar
but
the
level
of
quality
is
probably
what
sets
this
beer
apart
from
the
others
the
body
is
light
and
easy
the
taste
is
vibrant
with
sweet
malts
spice
coriander
citrus
and
a
clean
crisp
hop
finale
this
is
a
fine
rendition
of
the
classic
white
style
overall
kind
of
run
of
the
mill
for
a
witbier
not
so
much
doing
it
for
me
but
nothing
horrific
either
highly
carbonated
body
faint
banana
and
bubble
gum
flavors
with
bready
malts
a
touch
of
tropical
fruit
and
a
spicy
dry
finish
not
deeply
complex
or
overpowering
but
good
flavors
with
good
drinkability
not
nearly
the
best
or
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
but
much
better
than
flying
dogs
in
heat
wheat
crisp
cool
and
refreshing
not
bad
o
a
pretty
decent
example
of
a
belgium
wit
bier
ill
pick
up
some
more
of
these
for
a
bbq
later
in
the
week
oa
decent
summer
beer
easy
drinking
o
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
overall
aside
from
a
bit
of
harshness
in
the
flavor
i
like
this
beer
a
lot
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
pours
a
murky
straw
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
thick
white

banana
clove
grass
and
wheat
the
taste
is
nice
and
lemony
its
very
refreshing
with
grassy
hop
tones
banana
and
wheat
the
beer
is
light
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
this
is
a
solid
wheat
beer
nothing
spectacular
but
still
enjoyable
o
ok
witbier
but
so
many
others
that
are
better
this
one
is
drinkable
and
refreshing
just
not
remarkable
but
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
pale
hazy
unfiltered
yellow
coloring
with
a
thick
frothy
chunky
clean
white
head
aromas
spill
forth
as
you
pour
with
a
strong
clove
spicing
amongst
some
bready
and
nutmeg
characteristics
flavors
are
light
and
crisp
with
a
spicing
that
enhances
the
toasted
grain
and
bready
backbone
without
overpowering
it
nutmeg
cinnamon
and
clove
combine
to
give
a
roasted
baked
bread
type
flavor
profile
in
mouth
while
remaining
light
with
citrus
highlights
the
aftertaste
is
a
light
spice
and
roasting
which
is
well
balanced
and
pleasant
smooth
finish
with
a
crisp
bite
at
the
end
tasty
beer
overall
the
beer
has
decent
flavors
but
its
closer
to
a
hefe
then
a
wit
this
is
a
great
beer
looking
forward
to
having
it
again
o
good
for
the
style
its
light
pretty
refreshing
a
nice
curveball
from
the
usual
wheats
or
hefes
that
i
tend
towards
in
this
broad
style
area
have
to
agree
with
the
brothers
on
this
one
its
one
of
the
best
us
made
witbiers
on
the
market
this
beer
is
to
style
its
enjoyable
and
light
this
is
one
you
can
drink
for
a
while
at
any
time
honestly
though
unless
i
was
looking
for
this
style
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
no
matter
what
the
haters
may
say
i
do
enjoy
me

in

for
overall
a

good
witbier
in
my
opinion
ive
had
it
at
room
temperature
and
cold
and
in
the
former
case
i
noticed
a
touch
more
spice
of
some
kind

it

for

try
ive
certainly
had
better
wheat
beers
taste
is
crisp
and
sharp
with
a
spicy
citrus
vibe
being
most
prominent
a
light
and
easilysessioned
brew
for
fans
of
blue
moon
or
leffe
very
good
o
in
the
end
this
is
an
excellent
witbier
that
can
stand
toetotoe
with
its
belgian
counterparts
its
especially
welcome
if
you
enjoy
your
wits
on
the
spicy
side
if
not
you
may
find
it
to
be
a
little
much
enjoyed
from
a
bottle
on
a
sun
drenched
4th
of
july
bbq
drank
this
beverage
in
a
tasting
with
ommegang
witte
and
blue
moon
this
beer
was
very
close
to
ommegang
exhibiting
freshness
and
impressive
quality
yellow
in
appearance
flying
dog
succeeds
again
with
this
microbrew
effort
typical
for
a
witbier
though
definitely
as
fresh
as
they
come
with
citrus
banana
spices
and
other
predictable
flavors
coming
forth
well
done
flying
dog
a
little
out
of
balance
and
overly
spiced
but
overall
an
easy
light
refreshing
beer
overall
a
very
drinkable
witbier
with
a
nice
strong
residual
wheat
flavor
this
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
straw
color
with
a
nice
very
large
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
of
herbs
and
spices
clove
and
coriander
with
a
malty
wheat
the
feel
is
medium
the
taste
is
okay
there
are
the
spices
the
clove
and
coriander
along
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
over
all
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
in
the
style
it
is
possibly
the
best
looking
wit
i
have
ever
had
though
overall
a
fairly
good
version
of
a
wheat
beer
could
of
been
a
little
more
assertive
with
the
flavors
but
whats
there
is
pretty
good
very
good
use
of
coriander
overall
though
woody
creek
white
just
comes
up
a
little
short
it
seems
like
the
brewers
at
flying
dog
were
on
the
right
track
but
they
just
didnt
follow
through
all
the
way
and
the
resulting
beer
is
a
little
thin
overall
it
was
pretty
mellow
and
smooth
a
good
wit
beer
thats
light
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
another
solid
brew
by
flying
dog
id
definitely
pick
this
up
to
take
to
a
summer
party
or
to
offer
craft
and
noncraft
drinkers
its
not
a
standout
but
recommended
o
great
seasonal
that
i
havent
in
the
past
paid
attention
to
as
much
as
i
will
now
once
you
have
had
a
chance
to
enjoy
this
on
a
warm
day
relaxing
instead
of
out
of
the
bottle
while
grillingeatingswimming
you
can
gain
a
new
appreciation
for
it
d
this
beer
drinks
quite
nicely
and
is
very
quenching
on
this
90
degree
day
overall
an
excellent
wit
and
im
glad
i
got
a
6
pack
stocked
in
my
fridge
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
dry
bananas
in
the
taste
dry
bananas
and
nice
spice
hints
a
small
spice
bite
and
a
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
banana
like
aftertaste
nice
dry
presence
and
quite
easy
and
enjoyable
overall
i
found
the
taste
of
this
beer
to
be
a
little
subdued
i
guess
that
makes
it
more
drinkable
but
i
still
would
have
liked
a
little
more
flavour
punch
that
being
said
the
taste
that
it
does
have
is
pretty
good
overall
a
betterthanaverage
witbier
and
one
of
flying
dogs
better
beers
to
me
flying
dogs
regular
lineup
is
nothing
short
of
terrible
however
their
seasonals
and
standalone
beers
raging
bitch
comes
to
mind
here
have
been
impressive
this
is
one
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
if
you
can
find
it
and
is
a
decent
summer
seasonal
o
i
like
this
beer
recommended
would
drink
again
i
had
low
expectations
and
maybe
that
helped
really
drinkable
id
rank
this
one
somewhere
higher
than
hoegaarden
and
lower
than
allagash
white
this
has
a
very
promising
smell
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
follow
through
with
the
kind
of
complexity
and
balance
that
the
best
belgian
whites
deliver
carbonation
possibly
slightly
excessive
predominant
tastes
are
light
citrusmalt
and
corn
and
the
corn
lingers
a
bit
on
the
palate
this
is
a
passingly
good
representative
of
the
style
but
its
not
special
enough
for
me
to
seek
it
out
again
lemon
zest
and
a
slight
summery
tartness
compliment
a
solid
wheat
flavor
the
tartness
is
a
little
hidden
but
so
important
to
the
whole
character
of
this
beer
that
tartness
makes
it
unique
finishing
dry
and
clean
and
ohsorefreshing
the
wheat
malt
of
this
one
is
subtle
and
in
the
background
allowing
the
lemon
flavor
to
flourish
im
pretty
impressed
with
the
complexity
of
this
beer
on
top
of
optimum
refreshment
flying
dog
does
some
things
superbly
well
like
this
beer
coriander
like
crazy
in
the
nose
almost
to
the
point
where
i
coughed
the
taste
is
very
sappy
with
tons
of
coriander
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
a
hot
summer
day
this
witbier
pours
out
as
a
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
a
a
bit
foamy
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
light
floral
wheat
aroma
with
some
spice
in
there
too
the
taste
wasnt
the
most
flavorful
wit
out
there
i
found
that
flavors
in
this
brew
fell
short
of
my
expectations
here
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
with
a
decent
carbonation
i
would
try
this
one
again
and
see
if
i
feel
differently
about
it
pours
a
nice
hazy
straw
color
with
an
one
to
one
and
a
half
finger
stark
white
tight
head
the
color
has
some
visable
yeast
the
smell
is
of
lemons
corriander
anise
and
some
yeasty
sweetness
to
it
a
nice
subtle
inviting
aroma
the
taste
has
a
lemon
and
wheat
taste
up
front
with
some
yeasty
sweetness
to
it
and
the
end
and
the
backend
there
is
a
very
slight
hop
presence
at
the
end
to
balance
out
the
beer
the
taste
is
average
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
very
carbonated
overall
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
there
is
nothing
there
to
push
you
away
but
not
even
flavor
to
have
you
begging
for
more
a
better
brew
than
i
expected
while
cloudy
enough
to
present
double
shine
it
lacked
the
transparency
that
gives
the
elegance
i
usually
associate
with
this
one
in
the
glass
yeast
was
dark
and
chunky
no
lace
aromas
of
wheat
malt
dry
cereal
grains
and
faint
lemons
an
appealing
yeast
fruitiness
taste
is
light
very
dry
and
refreshingly
clean
wheat
malt
is
the
unabashed
signature
with
a
yeast
that
is
an
excellent
counter
to
the
malt
it
brings
a
clean
dry
sourness
while
adding
a
light
lemon
note
that
develops
the
wheat
twang
bitterness
is
low
but
the
dryness
fills
in
the
gap
nicely
light
refreshing
feel
along
with
the
dry
finish
makes
this
a
perfect
thirst
quencher
lawn
and
grill
companion
goes
down
quickly
and
easily
so
drinkability
is
no
problem
a
really
nice
american
brewing
of
a
difficult
style
thanks
flying
dog
m
zippy
in
the
mouth
mucho
bubbly
but
i
like
it
light
with
high
drinkability
ok
effort
there
is
a
nice
subtle
tartness
from
the
wheat
and
orange
perhaps
more
wheat
centric
and
fairly
clean
compared
to
other
wits
o
not
exactly
a
traditional
witbier
but
it
has
enough
good
flavors
to
be
enjoyable
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
witbierswheatshefes
but
i
have
to
say
that
for
this
style
flying
dog
made
a
very
nice
one
unique
compared
to
other
beers
in
their
lineup
so
dont
judge
this
beer
based
on
other
fds
overall
i
am
surprised
this
does
not
get
more
love
of
the
witbiers
ive
had
i
think
this
is
my
favorite
only
behind
allagash
white
and
its
a
lot
cheaper
its
very
flavorful
so
if
you
like
your
witbier
flavors
strong
go
for
this
one
it
does
this
without
overdoing
it
one
of
the
better
flying
dog
beers
and
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
cheers
well
maybe
witbiers
just
arent
the
thing
for
some
bas
but
i
cant
figure
out
a
b
overall
beer
is
thin
and
super
super
dry
this
is
the
driest
beer
ive
ever
drank
its
a
little
grainy
corriander
and
some
orange
peel
on
the
midpalate
super
dry
finish
decent
wit
three
quarter
inch
fizzy
white
head
hazy
pale
gold
body
head
quickly
dissipates
with
very
little
lacing
refreshing
citrus
aroma
initial
bitter
taste
with
a
hint
of
toasted
bread
a
little
more
hops
in
the
finish
than
expected
light
oily
mouthfeel
fizzy
carbonation
very
tasty
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
this
beer
was
very
straightforward
in
nearly
all
aspects
and
really
did
not
stand
out
to
me
at
all
the
mouthfeel
helps
this
beers
drinkability
but
the
lack
of
complexity
and
the
weakness
of
the
flavor
doesnt
really
help
my
disinterest
in
this
beer
d
eh
not
a
bad
wit
but
not
a
standout
either
overall
a
very
solid
little
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
without
any
issue
at
all
d
another
fairly
average
beer
from
flying
dog
the
wit
doesnt
offer
up
excitement
or
refreshment
leaving
it
pretty
lackluster
served
from
bottle
into
a
dogfish
head
signature
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
sediment
at
the
bottom
with
a
half
finger
white
head
that
subsides
to
a
minimal
amount
fairly
quickly
maintains
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
fermented
bananas
the
flavor
is
of
sweet
malt
wheat
and
subtle
fruit
it
has
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
not
aweinspiring
by
any
means
but
decent
aroma
is
little
worse
off
than
the
flavor
just
something
about
the
fermented
banana
smell
puts
me
off
just
glad
that
it
doesnt
show
up
in
the
flavor
the
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
coriander
with
a
little
bit
of
orange
peel
the
flavor
is
a
more
balanced
mix
of
orange
and
coriander
about
what
you
expect
in
a
witbier
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
after
pouring
the
beer
i
noticed
things
floating
around
im
assuming
their
yeast
there
isnt
much
aroma
here
they
say
they
use
orange
peel
and
coriander
but
im
not
picking
up
any
smells
like
bananas
and
tastes
like
bananas
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
oats
the
mouthfeel
is
right
for
a
belgian
wit
but
the
drinkability
isnt
great
it
doesnt
taste
terrible
but
there
are
a
lot
of
things
missing
from
what
i
have
had
with
belgian
wits
unless
this
is
true
to
style
from
belgium
flying
dog
woody
creek
white
is
a
belgianstyle
wheat
that
is
good
better
than
the
blue
moons
and
shock
tops
but
it
is
lacking
the
aromatics
and
flavor
that
the
best
examples
have
there
is
a
little
clove
and
banana
but
not
much
else
the
wheat
flavor
and
acidity
is
missing
the
pale
straw
color
and
the
head
were
promising
but
the
smell
and
taste
were
pleasant
but
nothing
made
my
tongue
call
out
for
more
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
drinkability
enjoyed
but
wasnt
running
for
the
next
if
theres
any
downside
to
having
been
exposed
to
founders
dfh
avery
etc
its
the
appreciation
bar
is
significantly
raised
even
though
the
traditional
orange
and
coriander
tastes
here
are
somewhat
muted
i
still
am
a
fan
of
this
beer
because
its
highly
refreshing
on
the
finish
and
i
love
the
wheat
that
sticks
around
it
isnt
my
top
wit
but
its
worthy
overall
this
was
far
from
an
exceptional
beer
but
it
wasnt
all
that
bad
either
i
initially
had
it
rated
higher
thinking
it
was
an
american
wheat
but
as
a
wit
it
doesnt
cut
it
as
much
not
worth
seeking
out
but
if
it
pops
up
its
worth
a
shot
solid
overall
and
above
average
but
not
really
outstanding
a
run
of
the
mill
but
still
quite
good
belgian
style
witbier
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
have
been
enjoying
this
the
last
two
summers
finally
got
around
to
reviewing
it
pours
nice
orangeish
with
two
fingers
of
lace
strong
hint
of
orange
and
coriander
good
mouth
a
bit
almost
chewy
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
with
this
variety
very
drinkable
particularly
during
summer
months
good
marks
for
flying
dog
on
this
one
plus
i
love
hunter
s
and
ralph
steadmans
artwork
is
off
the
hook
this
finnishes
with
a
waxy
slight
bubblegum
flavor
it
sounds
off
but
it
really
works
with
this
beer
id
have
more
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
i
dont
know
why
but
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
this
surprised
me
a
little
i
would
buy
this
again
tastecoriander
clove
citrus
zest
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
would
make
an
excellent
hot
weather
session
brew
incredibly
let
down
by
the
look
and
aroma
sisappointed
in
the
flavor
as
well
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
would
pass
this
up
for
the
many
superior
versions
of
the
style
pours
with
a
little
head
which
dissipates
within
four
seconds
light
lacing
around
the
glass
that
slides
back
to
the
white
ring
almost
immediately
light
smell
of
hops
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
ibu
on
bottle
18
but
drinks
more
around
a
10
color
is
a
4
on
the
srm
chart
very
clean
transparency
with
very
small
carbonation
bubbles
does
have
a
pleasing
aftertaste
of
hops
that
clings
to
the
back
of
my
upper
palette
and
through
my
nose
not
a
beer
for
which
i
would
spend
much
money
but
i
would
not
turn
it
down
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
this
one
is
fine
on
the
drinkability
meter
nothing
offensive
and
pretty
darn
refreshing
just
didnt
have
all
the
elements
of
a
good
witbier
my
initial
reaction
is
that
this
is
an
easy
drinking
brew
i
think
flying
dog
does
a
great
job
at
recreating
this
belgian
style
of
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
august
day
like
today
pours
a
hazy
yellowish
that
has
a
small
white
head
that
doesnt
stay
long
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
strong
of
yeast
lemon
and
spices
as
is
the
taste
light
mouthfeel
and
a
beer
that
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
not
a
huge
flying
dog
fan
but
this
is
an
all
around
solid
witbier
md
crisp
and
dry
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
finish
is
astringent
pretty
disappointing
not
up
to
par
with
other
flying
dog
brews
ive
had
so
this
basically
sucks
its
flying
dogs
summer
ale
and
apparently
it
was
made
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
pours
a
pale
yet
hazy
yellow
kind
of
like
sunshine
in
the
state
of
maryland
where
this
is
brewed
very
little
head
but
what
there
is
is
persistent
leaving
no
lace
however
smell
is
refreshing
but
faint
obvious
hints
of
coriander
to
give
it
that
beglian
spiciness
it
fails
however
flavor
is
superthin
almost
lemonade
like
its
clean
and
tangy
like
a
white
should
be
but
it
immediately
finishes
off
almost
waterlike
and
has
no
length
to
the
finish
at
all
this
is
what
id
imagine
a
hard
lemonade
would
taste
like
but
without
the
good
parts
of
the
lemonade
very
poor
effort
all
in
all
however
at
8
99
a
sixer
you
can
spare
the
change
on
occasion
if
you
have
friends
who
arent
beer
drinkers
i
would
buy
this
again
as
everything
from
flying
dog
seems
to
be
safe
for
a
repeat
but
i
am
a
little
disappointed
i
like
a
more
german
wheat
beer
taste
or
something
more
powerful
than
this
nonoffensive
light
beer
very
easy
drinking
belgian
clone
drinkability
definitely
a
good
summer
beer
but
also
flavorful
i
found
the
other
beers
ive
had
from
flying
dog
rather
disappointing
but
this
one
is
probably
the
best
ive
had
from
them
d
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
i
would
definitely
consider
this
to
be
sessionable
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
nice
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
nice

off
with
a
decent

pretty
good
balance
creamy
mouthfeel
and
quite
drinkable
nice
for
the
hot
summer
ahead
a
nice
example
of
the
style
but
its
just
another
in
the
long
line
of
springsummer
wit
seasonals
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
citrus

spices
taste
is
mild
citrus
and
spice
less
flavorful
than
other
witbiers
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
makes
for
a
quality
beer
d
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
its
light
goes
down
easy
and
has
nice
complexity
to
boot
one
of
flying
dogs
better
offerings
overall
a
solid
showing
from
flying
dog
nice
aroma
that
matches
enhances
the
citrus
taste
the
spice
is
present
but
not
overwhelming
light
bodied
and
so
easy
to
drink
a
great
offering
from
flying
dog
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
to
medium
with
a
easy
drinking
body
to
it
it
goes
down
well
and
is
low
in
abv
so
does
not
kick
harder
than
expected
a
nice
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
zesty
and
carbonated
nicely
with
a
spiced
bit
of
yeasty
dryness
pulling
through
in
the
finish
dok
but
seems
to
be
lacking
something
to
me
it
has
the
flavour
profile
that
it
should
but
there
simply
seems
to
be
something
missing
this
is
certainly
not
a
go
to
wit
for
me
d
well
i
only
seen
this
a
3
sons
as
a
seasonal
but
i
may
buy
this
again
as
forum
of
a
new
placement
for
the
tire
dog
in
the
variety
pack
yet
we
all
know
they
are
never
perfect
pours
deep
golden
and
cloudy
with
a
very
thick
foamy
head
that
hangs
around
all
the
way
to
the
end
smells
of
lemon
and
grass
with
a
little
bit
of
vegetable
tastes
about
the
same
grassy
with
hints
of
lemon
some
spices
vanilla
and
a
little
caramel
nicely
balanced
lighter
and
crisper
than
i
thought
it
might
be
blue
moon
was
the
only
other
wit
that
i
have
had
and
i
didnt
care
for
it
at
all
so
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
d
a
good
beer
the
first
one
out
of
the
mixed
pack
i
got
was
clearly
bad
but
the
rest
have
been
quite
good
i
can
definitely
see
drinking
this
all
summer
long
d
a
good
beer
for
the
warmer
months
nice
alternative
to
a
hoegaarden
pours
clouded
smoked
straw
with
a
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
into
a
ring
smell
is
very
pleasant
sweet
with
an
underlying
base
of
vanilla
and
fresh
citrus
also
some
citrus
vegetation
notes
taste
is
highly
carbonated
with
the
coriander
doing
its
part
im
getting
slightly
less
orange
peel
the
end
is
smooth
back
to
the
vanilla
malt
nothing
outofthisworld
but
a
decent
white
beer
word
to
the
wise
if
you
want
to
try
this
just
buy
1
12oz
bottle
to
test
it
dont
waste
your
on
a
full
6er
this
is
actually
substantial
for
such
a
light
beer
and
very
crisp
at
the
end
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
not
as
strong
flavored
as
some
other
wits
ive
had
but
there
is
certainly
nothing
offensive
here
a
very
balanced
and
pleasant
beer
to
drink
d
a
delicious
wit
bier
pour
another
and
ill
tell
a
friend
its
pretty
plain
for
a
wit
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
drinkability
a
nice
example
of
a
wheat
beer
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
still
a
good
domestic
wit
and
quite
drink
able
m
d
carbonation
has
a
pleasant
shimmer
but
is
a
little
on
the
softer
side
this
is
a
bit
of
a
nicer
representation
of
the
belgian
styles
as
compared
to
many
american
takes
not
so
aggressively
citrus
which
also
saves
it
from
tasting
too
much
like
a
breakfast
cereal
like
fruit
loops
or
fruity
pebbles
nice
balance
easy
drinking
and
agreeable
flavours
make
for
a
nicely
done
brew
i
dont
see
a
lot
of
reason
to
go
into
detail
for
this
beer
as
its
simply
a
basic
belgianstyle
witbier
except
that
its
clear
theres
a
good
deal
of
coriander
flavor
to
it
and
its
pretty
dry
i
prefer
it
to
the
sweeter
or
fuller
versions
of
the
style
blue
moon
but
it
just
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
character
of
the
best
ones
hoegaarden
of
course
still
its
nicely
done
and
pretty
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
nice
clear
translucent
golden
with
a
finebubbled
white
head
aroma
is
wheaty
yeasty
and
fairly
strong
with
a
hint
of
lemon
though
this
may
have
come
from
the
de
rigueur
lemon
slice
rich
mouthfilling
wheaty
flavor
is
yeasty
with
a
decided
undertone
of
lemon
and
a
whisper
of
sweetness
texture
is
fairly
smooth
and
fizzy
flying
dog
does
it
again
this
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipated
and
didnt
lace
well
the
smell
was
very
subtle
citrus
and
spice
not
exactly
as
prominent
as
one
would
come
to
expect
from
a
wit
when
the
time
came
to
taste
it
the
smell
was
deadon
but
dare
i
say
dissolved
quickly
to
an
unpleasant
almost
popcornish
finish
it
felt
lightmediumbodied
on
the
palate
with
decent
carbonation
given
the
bad
finish
in
the
taste
department
even
though
the
mouthfeel
was
good
i
wasnt
reaching
for
another
one
drinkability
easy
drinking
beer
which
works
well
on
a
hot
summer
day
worth
a
try
a
medium
mouthfeel
and
maybe
a
touch
overcarbonated
for
my
taste
but
certainly
refreshing
i
enjoy
this
brew
anytime
of
the
year
its
so
drinkable
and
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
drinks
very
well
but
what
wit
at
4
8
doesnt
the
wheat
is
flavorful
and
smooth
verdict
woody
creek
white
is
a
tasty
little
brew
that
works
well
as
flying
dogs
summer
refesher
a
solidenough
american
witbier
d
i
really
liked
it
very
easy
to
drink
nice
and
refreshing
d
a
really
nice
and
inviting
witbier
an
excellent
selection
on
hot
humid
days
cloudy
pale
brass
with
a
creamy
pock
marked
white
head
that
leaves
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
true
to
the
style
coriander
spice
wheat
and
orange
peel
tart
and
dry
fruitiness
up
front
with
an
underlying
sweet
soft
banana
flavor
and
plenty
of
spice
full
bodied
and
creamy
with
seltzery
carbonation
a
nice
wit
its
one
of
those
beers
thats
best
suited
for
drinking
and
less
suited
for
thinking
as
soon
as
i
wrote
down
my
thoughts
i
didnt
like
it
as
much
as
crash
davis
told
nuke
laloosh
in
bull
durham
dont
think
you
can
only
hurt
the
ballclub
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
tons
of
rising
carbonation
the
white
head
was
thin
and
retained
as
a
layer
leaving
decent
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
belgian
yeast
coriander
sweet
malt
and
a
hint
of
dough
the
flavors
were
well
balanced
and
totally
on
point
for
the
style
with
the
sweet
malt
and
hints
of
cookie
dough
up
front
followed
by
the
floral
hops
in
the
middle
and
the
belgian
yeast
at
the
end
the
finish
was
a
little
yeasty
for
me
but
i
appreciated
the
flavor
arc
and
distinct
notes
within
the
mouthfeel
was
good
but
a
little
oily
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
just
touch
high
solid
but
not
outstanding
per
se
di
dont
have
any
problems
with
drinking
this
im
kind
of
bummed
that
it
is
only
a
seasonal
offering
d
this
is
an
excellent
summer
brew
with
a
killer
drinkablility
factor
when
poured
into
pint
glass
the
color
was
a
hazy
golden
yellow
nothing
exceptional
very
little
foam
with
some
lace
retention
now
the
smell
of
spices
and
a
hint
of
yeast
was
getting
my
interest
what
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
of
spices
fruit
and
other
components
grabbed
my
interest
all
components
put
together
makes
this
witbier
fantastic
this
could
be
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
so
far
nicely
balanced
and
when
all
the
flavors
are
put
together
this
witbier
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
foam
that
orginated
at
teh
beginning
of
the
pouring
wisps
down
to
light
lacing
around
the
edges
the
amber
brown
beer
gives
off
the
aroma
of
sweet
hops
citrus
tones
and
slight
coriander
the
taste
follows
suit
but
also
gives
a
slight
wheat
tone
as
well
overall
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
during
the
summer
months
sadly
the
orange
helped
the
head
but
little
else
this
witbier
was
flat
and
had
a
nasty
lingering
bitterness
after
each
swallow
i
typically
like
everything
flying
dog
has
to
offer
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
their
in
heat
wheat
is
a
much
friendlier
witbier

now
overall
started
a
bit
german
but
ended
belgian
a
nice
summer
ale
from
flying
dog
pours
a
nice
slightly
cloudy
golden
color
with
no
head
very
sharp
carbonation
a
little
too
much
very
belgian
flavor
with
some
coriander
and
other
spices
to
taste
its
a
pretty
a
decent
belgian
but
it
might
be
better
bottle
conditioned
id
look
elsewhere
for
better
light
belgians
one
of
my
favorites
for
summer
weather
very
good
beer
and
really
hitting
the
spot
right
now
first
and
foremost
this
beer
is
extremely
robust
for
being
under
5abv
really
a
welcome
surprise
while
enjoying
it
appearance
is
an
organceyellow
with
small
white
head
smell
is
more
similar
to
belgian
pales
with
spicy
phenolic
traits
and
touches
of
witelike
citrus
and
such
flavor
is
huge
with
citrust
and
coriander
as
well
as
some
belgiany
spice
the
spice
though
is
subtle
and
doesnt
become
unpleasant
mouth
is
light
yet
fullbodied
very
refreshing
again
the
spice
doesnt
override
the
citrusy
characters
its
extremely
drinkable
and
considering
the
low
abv
very
sessionable
as
well
tastes
like
a
9
abv
beer
drinks
like
what
it
is
an
almost5
drinkability
a
very
good
beer
something
that
would
be
perfect
for
summer
or
whenever
soft
and
delicate
on
the
mouth
despite
a
crackle
of
carbonation
on
your
taste
buds
the
finish
is
slightly
dry
and
almost
to
a
chalky
stage
but
maintains
with
a
floral
after
taste
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
especially
during
those
hot
summer
days
very
good
compared
to
most
americanbrewed
belgian
white
ales
comparable
to
its
belgian
counterparts
i
found
this
highly
drinkable
and
recommend
it
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
think
its
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
my
bro
approves
d
solid
example
of
the
witbier
style
with
a
slightly
more
chewy
mouthfeel
that
some
others
ive
had
the
sweet
and
spicy
characteristics
complement
one
another
quite
nicely
here
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
very
dry
and
spicey
finish
not
the
best
witbier
ive
ever
had
but
it
is
worth
a
shot
d
i
could
probably
drink
several
without
any
problem
this
seems
like
a
good
candidate
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
while
im
outside
grilling
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
it
stayed
fairly
cold
this
is
probably
the
wit
bier
that
got
me
into
the
style
when
i
tried
it
about
a
year
ago
might
be
my
favorite
wit
but
i
also
give
props
to
avery
white
rascal
and
great
lakes
holy
moses
flying
dog
tends
to
make
pretty
good
beers
but
this
is
one
of
its
most
well
crafted
and
sessionable
highly
recommend
this
one
drinkability
exceedingly
refreshing
one
of
the
better
made
and
most
balanced
of
all
the
american
made
wits
this
is
a
nicely
done
wit
no
flaws
not
overly
spiced
and
hard
to
drink
like
some
wits
i
would
like
a
little
bit
more
of
an
interesting
characteristic
though
one
of
my
favorite
summer
seasonals
if
not
the
best
i
went
looking
for
this
today
and
found
it
on
my
second
stop
i
want
to
say
i
prefer
it
on
draft
but
i
have
not
had
a
draft
serving
this
year
yet
definitely
worth
a
try
notes
a
odd
variation
on
the
style
but
props
for
originality
this
beer
reminds
me
so
much
of
sitting
on
the
white
sand
beaches
of
sarasota
fl
i
wish
i
were
back
there
drinking
this
beer
with
my
buddy
lenny
who
first
turned
me
on
to
flying
dog
at
atlantis
aquariums
bar
in
srq
flying
dog
you
have
really
turned
your
act
around
nicely
done
ive
had
better
wits
but
this
is
a
solid
one
among
them
give
it
a
try
brewery
is
only
an
hour
away
from
me
so
maybe
ill
go
and
try
some
of
this
fresh
pale
cloudy
golden
almost
milky
with
yeast
sediment
awesome
chunky
bright
white
clouds
of
heaven
form
above
the
rim
of
my
glass
what
a
great
looking
creating
fine
lacing
forms
evenly
with
each
sip
quite
artsy
aromatics
offer
up
citrus
and
banana
smoothie
infused
bread
dough
with
sharp
hints
of
lemon
peel
and
light
anise
flavor
goes
a
bit
overboard
on
the
chalky
spiced
anise
kick
but
edges
out
enought
with
citrus
and
light
banana
tones
to
make
up
for
it
creamy
pale
malts
with
light
herbal
hops
bringing
in
a
chammomile
like
tea
experience
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
pretty
effervescent
head
when
i
popped
the
cap
it
let
out
some
bubbly
like
carbonation
drinability
is
solid
especially
when
its
in
the
4s
as
far
as
abv
goes
spicy
yeast
gets
better
with
each
sip
what
a
nice
brew
to
sip
on
this
summer
relative
to
the
style
there
are
so
many
options
that
are
so
much
better
than
this
i
dont
see
any
reason
to
keep
this
around
not
a
bad
beer
just
kind
of
bland
a
good
choice
for
a
summer
bbq
or
a
ball
game
which
really
is
all
right
by
me
very
good
could
use
a
bit
more
of
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
but
otherwise
a
decent
example
after
first
we
felt
the
spice
registered
a
bit
too
high
but
after
a
few
sips
this
one
grew
on
us
and
there
was
none
of
the
soapy
flavor
generally
associated
with
overspiced
americanbrewed
belgian
white
ales
comparable
to
its
belgian
counterparts
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
in
the
us
d
this
is
my
first
brew
from
flying
dog
im
ready
to
try
the
other
stuff
they
have
this
is
a
really
good
wit
very
easy
to
drink
and
could
easily
drink
a
few
in
a
night
overall
i
was
a
little
dissappointed
with
this
beer
i
didnt
feel
that
it
was
really
true
to
style
it
tasted
more
like
a
hefeweizen
to
me
it
was
more
heavily
carbonated
and
hopped
than
most
witbiers
i
have
tried
it
didnt
come
across
as
being
very
complex
either
mostly
one
or
two
flavors
masked
by
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangishamber
with
lots
of
puffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
good
while
and
leaves
lots
of
lace
around
the
glass
it
smells
predominantly
of
banana
and
spicy
cloves
with
a
bit
of
sweet
citrus
in
there
as
well
the
taste
is
sweet
spicy
cloves
white
fruit
coriander
and
a
little
yeast
the
carbonation
is
moderate
but
the
mediumbodied
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
cloying
with
an
offdry
finish
this
is
quite
true
to
style
and
refreshing
but
its
not
something
id
pursue
in
a
session
drinkability
this
is
a
refreshing
wit
thats
on
the
dryer
side
flavors
are
mild
and
enjoyable
i
will
seek
this
out
again
d
i
prefer
something
with
a
little
stronger
flavor
but
still
a
good
beer
over
all
another
great
way
to
introduce
newbies
to
an
unfamiliar
style
appearance
is
good
with
a
slight
head
hazy
yellow
in
color
doesnt
look
filtered
smell
is
a
bit
weak
some
orange
peel
and
banana
not
sure
that
the
banana
belongs
here
taste
is
pretty
similar
put
with
some
peppery
flavor
added
in
and
coriander
mouthfeel
is
decent
light
to
medium
in
body
and
light
carbonation
drinkability
is
pretty
good
pours
a
typical
hazy
straw
color
with
almost
no
head
what
little
there
was
disappeared
quickly
and
left
no
trace
on
the
glass
some
sediments
smells
strongly
citric
with
a
lot
of
spicethink
peppered
oranges
with
a
dash
of
coriander
this
character
defines
the
taste
but
with
an
underlying
slightly
cloying
sweetness
thrown
in
very
spicy
slightly
tart
finish
decent
mouthfeel
the
high
carbonation
works
well
for
the
style
pretty
mediocre
overall
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
ive
had
most
of
the
flying
dog
brews
and
this
was
probably
my
least
favorite
it
didnt
have
much
to
offer
the
appearance
was
a
lighter
gold
despite
an
aggressive
pour
there
was
almost
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
beer
smelled
of
oranges
and
grape
fruit
and
had
a
few
spices
the
taste
of
the
beer
kinda
reminded
me
of
vitamin
water
the
beer
was
way
to
watery
and
the
citrus
taste
comes
in
almost
as
an
after
taste
the
taste
was
dominated
with
oranges
but
seemed
to
have
a
lemonlime
mix
to
it
i
really
didnt
feel
like
having
another
beer
after
this
one
honestly
it
would
probably
be
best
to
drink
this
beer
on
a
warmer
day
rather
than
a
cold
winter
night
as
i
can
see
this
beer
being
refreshing
bottle
poured
a
light
hazy
yellow
color
ale
with
a
light
foamy
head
with
minimal
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
is
dominated
by
loads
of
ginger
notes
with
some
orange
peel
also
discernable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
ginger
some
coriander
and
some
orange
peel
body
is
way
too
thin
for
the
style
with
some
average
carbonation
a
bit
more
wheat
would
have
benefited
and
this
would
have
been
a
great
beer
very
drinkable
i
think
the
only
wit
beer
ive
enjoyed
d
refreshing
clean
tasty
some
high
quality
stuff
here
pours
an
almost
neon
yellow

some
banana
and
not
overly
carbonated
like
so
many
other
macro
belgian
whites
absolutely
great
belgian
white
recommended
to
all
typical
of
witbier
it
has
a
fruity
and
spicy
aroma
and
taste
coriander
and
grapefruit
are
present
as
well
as
some
spices
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
blends
well
and
tastes
fantastic
medium
body
with
good
balance
to
the
carbonation
overall
very
drinkable
and
a
very
tastey
brew
d
aside
from
the
mouthfeel
a
good
beer
shrug
overall
the
beer
has
a
pretty
light
flavor
and
is
very
refreshing
which
i
think
was
the
intention
carbonated
yet
rounded
mouthfeel
good
texture
for
this
style
this
beer
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
gold
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
fades
to
a
nice
ring
of
lace
the
aroma
brings
the
requisite
citrus
and
spice
and
the
yeast
are
doing
there
thing
with
the
esters
the
taste
has
a
decent
amount
of
coriander
pepper
and
whatnot
but
the
fruitiness
isnt
really
there
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
crisp
side
but
pretty
darn
drinkable
a
totally
drinkable
beer
although
not
the
best
example
of
a
witbier
out
there
this
is
thinner
and
not
as
malty
as
some
but
the
4
8
abv
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
i
wont
revisit
but
fans
of
the
style
should
at
least
give
it
a
try
d
this
is
a
smooth
drinking
brew
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
introductory
beer
to
new
beer
enthusiasts
overall
a
very
well
executed
beer
many
breweries
dont
do
subtle
well
but
flying
dog
shows
it
skill
here
d
great
beer
not
the
best
witbier
ive
had
but
it
is
really
good
d
a
nice
and
flavorful
witbier
that
loses
some
of
its
drinkability
due
to
the
unfortunately
low
carbonation
the
spice
character
is
balanced
and
quite
nice
especially
in
the
aroma
if
this
had
been
properly
carbonated
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
overal
this
a
good
witbier
from
a
widely
available
craft
brewer
refreshing
and
tasty
without
being
expensive
is
a
good
thing
for
a
beer
to
have
d
i
really
like
this
wit
i
could
easily
drink
a
sixpack
of
this
stuff
good
flavours
well
balanced
well
worth
the
money
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
tasty
witbier
and
a
good
style
from
the
flying
dog
brewery
of
denver
co
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
but
in
a
good
way
drinkability
is
high
due
to
the
great
flavors
a
great
lighter
offering
from
flying
dog
a
bit
more
refined
than
their
in
heat
wheat
im
actually
very
impressed
with
this
version
even
if
summer
is
long
gone
d
fairly
low
abv
and
decent
flavoring
make
this
quite
drinkable
not
offensive
in
any
regard
and
quite
quenching
all
in
all
a
very
nice
example
of
a
witbier
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
friends
and
try
it
again
really
smooth
lager
like
not
yeasty
one
bit
a
very
refreshing
beer
clear
smooth
high
carbonation
made
it
seem
like
a
lager
but
taste
was
nice
smooth
and
refreshing
d
while
this
isntt
my
favorite
witbier
ever
it
did
have
its
own
charm
about
it
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
a
good
summer
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
good
beer
but
not
one
of
the
best
whites
that
ive
had
but
very
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
nice
and
crisp
drinkability
is
good
the
low
alcohol
and
solid
witbier
taste
make
this
a
winner
as
a
summertime
session
beer
nothing
to
complain
about
on
this
one
a
sure
winner
if
you
enjoy
a
wit
dont
pass
this
one
up
fair
witbier
fairly
average
this
beer
definately
would
not
be
my
first
or
second
choice
if
i
had
a
good
variety
of
whites
to
choose
from
but
its
not
bad
either
and
if
it
was
available
in
a
store
where
i
could
not
purchase
other
whites
id
buy
it
again
poured
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
stayed
for
a
while
aroma
is
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
spice
flavor
is
tangy
citrus
with
a
bit
of
spice
to
it
as
well
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
both
seem
about
right
low
alcohol
and
easy
drinkability
of
this
one
make
it
very
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
and
this
could
be
a
new
session
beer
drinkability
i
could
throw
back
a
few
of
these
things
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
solid
drinkability
pours
a
murky
yellowish
orange
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
smels
of
sour
grapes
some
spice
and
coriander
tastes
tart
and
lemony
up
front
with
some
light
fruits
and
coriander
light
mouthfeel
and
a
bit
chalky
this
is
a
smooth
drinker
that
lacks
a
bit
in
the
taste
department
also
not
necessarily
the
most
drinkable
of
flying
dogs
options
but
joins
good
company
of
my
favorites
from
this
brewery
a
very
smooth
beer
i
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
nicely
balanced
very
good
not
a
style
that
im
accustomed
too
but
will
be
exploring
more
thanks
to
this
yummy
brew
poured
into
a
pint
glass
from
a
12oz
bottle
appearance
is
a
pale
and
cloudy
strawyellow
with
a
thin
finger
of
white
fizzy
head
that
slowly
dissipated
into
a
moderate
ring
of
lace
aroma
is
spicy
and
sweet
with
earthy
undertones
notes
of
clove
and
banana
taste
is
malty
spicy
and
alive
with
citrus
notes
has
a
wheaty
flavor
that
falls
in
and
out
with
the
malt
and
the
faintest
touch
of
floral
hop
notes
finish
is
light
and
dry
a
little
musty
mouthfeel
is
rough
given
the
active
carbonation
against
a
light
to
medium
bodied
brew
drinkability
is
great
aside
from
the
aroma
this
is
the
high
point
for
me
in
this
brew
given
its
low
abv
and
appreciable
characteristics
makes
for
a
great
session
wit
would
recommend
ive
wanted
to
try
this
for
a
while
for
several
reasons
i
like
witbiers
i
like
flying
dog
and
im
wanting
to
get
at
least
one
bottle
of
everything
i
can
for
steadmans
art
they
didnt
have
this
in
singles
but
i
just
had
to
have
at
least
one
so
i
bought
a
six
pack
for
the
above
reasons
though
i
was
worried
id
regret
it
i
will
have
no
problem
downing
these
guys
great
stuff
d
definitely
drinkable
one
of
the
better
witbiers
ive
had
and
will
definitely
be
looking
for
it
again
if
you
dont
mind
licorice
flavor
this
beer
is
way
easy
to
drink
its
not
even
that
its
an
overpowering
flavor
just
that
its
there
had
the
classic
wit
aroma
as
well
really
spicy
with
corriander
and
bitter
orange
peel
the
taste
has
a
little
more
bit
than
the
average
wit
almost
farmhouse
spice
when
i
grab
most
wits
im
looking
for
something
tasty
with
a
smooth
finish
instead
of
a
bite
so
this
one
wouldnt
be
an
everyday
wit
but
when
i
want
a
little
more
this
one
would
be
perfect
not
sure
we
get
it
except
in
the
sampler
pack
which
sucks
overall
a
really
good
wit
and
i
highly
recommend
drink
ability
its
a
very
drinkable
and
i
might
want
to
try
it
again
some
time
but
its
not
going
to
be
my
first
choice
a
thick
and
milky
feel
with
lots
of
body
much
thicker
than
a
regular
wit
definitely
more
like
a
hefe
than
a
wit
a
tad
misleading
but
a
hearty
drinkable
brew
not
very
summery
though
i
must
admit
pours
a
murky
light
gold
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
great
lacing
smells
great
citrus
bananas
lemons
coriander
all
the
great
true
hefe
scents
the
taste
is
delicious
same
taste
as
the
smell
but
also
sweet
malts
slight
yeast
medium
bodied
smoothe
carbo
deelish
average
drinkability
not
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
d
a
very
exceptional
wit
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
enjoyable
and
refreshing
nonetheless
im
still
hit
and
miss
with
this
brewery
but
its
worth
a
try
pours
a
four
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
to
a
thin
ring
leaving
traces
of
lace
pale
cloudy

a
ton

in
bottom

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
capital
convenience
concord
nh
d
very
drinkable
if
youre
up
for
a
good
witbier
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
medium
foamy
head
on
a
cloudy
yellow
body
smell
was
sharp
for
a
wit
kind
of
caught
me
off
guard
a
bit
same
deal
in
the
taste
the
grapefruit
bitterness
was
a
tad
high
for
me
especially
for
a
wit
wondering
if
it
was
too
peppery
im
going
to
give
it
another
go
if
i
see
it
as
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
from
a
usually
very
good
brewery
but
for
now
a
bit
of
a
letdown
despite
a
vigorous
pour
not
much
of
a
head
formed
or
lasted
on
this
beer
though
it
does
have
a
nice
cloudy
yellow
gold
color
the
nose
though
is
excellent
very
perfumy
with
plenty
of
curacao
aroma
spicy
coriander
and
light
wheat
the
taste
matches
the
aroma
well
with
a
lot
of
peppery
spicy
coriander
backed
with
a
citrus
tartness
i
think
it
could
use
a
little
more
sweetness
as
it
gets
a
little
harsh
near
the
finish
still
all
the
right
flavors
for
a
wit
are
present
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
unfiltered
smells
like
raw
wheat
and
citrus
peel
very
aromatic
i
love
the
way
this
beer
smells
taste
is
light
refreshing
with
a
strong
wheat
flavor
slightly
tart
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
belgian
ale
yeast
a
slight
amount
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
rounds
things
out
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
carbonation
very
high
highly
drinkable
though
a
great
summer
beer
cloudy
dull
yellow
lots
of
bubbly
off
white
froth
sits
on
top
it
leaves
plenty
of
lace
as
i
drink
as
well
strong
aroma
almost
saison
like
in
its
lemon
and
leather
smells
also
some
evident
corriander
spicing
pretty
fragrant
but
not
overly
done
in
my
opinion
taste
is
very
good
nice
malted
wheat
base
with
a
strong
presence
of
orange
and
lemon
peel
as
well
corriander
adds
some
complexity
very
tasty
well
done
wit
ill
get
more
if
i
see
it
again
d
very
drinkable
especially
during
these
warm
summer
months
refreshingly
perfect
for
the
deck
great
drinkability
good
carbonation
smooth
and
refreshing
d
nice
full
flavor
easy
mouthfeel
and
low
alcohol
make
this
witbier
a
true
session
ale
i
think
i
could
easily
down
a
sixer
of
this
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
from
flying
dog
d
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
first
think
i
noticed
was
the
interesting
artwork
on
the
label
pretty
psychotic
looking
but
pretty
neat
i
poured
this
one
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
producing
a
small
beige
white
head
it
had
an
opaque
golden
yellow
color
and
swirls
of
surface
bubbles
lingered
through
the
entire
experience
smelled
of
coriander
and
tasted
similar
with
a
little
bitter
kick
at
the
beginning
followed
by
wheat
ending
flying
dog
did
a
nice
job
on
their
take
of
a
wit
beer
nothing
too
extreme
just
what
you
would
expect
for
a
wit
d
very
nice
drinkability
refreshing
tart
and
perfect
for
the
summertime
heat
six
pack
worthy
as
you
cant
go
wrong
here
a
really
good
example
of
a
belgian
wit
deffiently
one
of
the
better
american
made
super
zesty
and
refreshing
it
matches
the
classic
style
very
well
a
great
beer
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
one
is
doable
too
though
d
real
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
complexity
of
this
beer
compared
to
some
belgian
wits
ive
had
is
not
equal
but
this
is
one
american
wit
i
pleasantly
enjoyed
will
recommend
and
have
again
for
a
better
sampling
and
one
i
think
can
hold
its
head
up
high
md
low
carbonation
sweet
up
front
a
bit
sour
at
the
rear
very
crisp
finish
this
is
right
on
the
heels
of
allagash
i
am
just
in
lust
with
this
beer
recommended
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
was
a
hazy
yelloworange
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
reminded
me
of
whipped
cream
there
was
some
delicate
lacing
the
aroma
was
citrus
and
grain
it
had
an
orange
taste
althought
there
was
a
late
tang
of
lemon
some
malt
also
and
a
tiny
bit
of
spiciness
i
thought
this
beer
was
pretty
robust
for
a
wit
and
really
enjoyed
it
pours
a
fully
fogged
in
straw
with
brown
tones
nice
off
white
head
that
really
shows
off
a
pretty
firm
pour
wow
to
the
nose
total
wheat
funkadelic
citrusis
there
but
not
overpoweringly
so
flavor
is
bloody
smooth
just
a
nice
balanced
ride
of
mild
citrus
over
a
fairly
full
but
smooth
body
of
wit
it
gets
a
4
5
for
being
evenkeeled
and
not
for
being
some
insane
ride
of
flavor
and
also
for
the
fact
that
this
is
an
american
producer
putting
out
something
so
well
done
feel
is
as
expected
a
bit
thinner
on
the
liquid
with
a
nice
smooth
carbonation
overall
the
theme
for
this
ride
is
smooth
that
basically
describes
most
of
the
aspects
of
this
beer
easily
drinkable
and
totally
sessionable
as
i
have
this
i
just
imagine
sitting
on
a
porch
somewhere
cooling
myself
down
as
the
summer
heat
tries
to
ruin
my
day
prosit
mk
a
bit
light
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
summer
beer
but
others
are
better
including
312
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
carbonation
is
excellent
gives
it
a
great
crisp
taste
its
more
drinkable
than
i
expected
overall
its
a
decent
beer
worth
a
try
flying
dog
doesnt
distribute
much
around
me
but
i
got
this
sixer
from
purvs
in
peckville
pa
and
i
hope
he
continues
to
bring
the
everincreasing
likes
of
flying
dog
founders
hopping
frog
etc
to
the
area
as
i
would
like
to
become
more
familiar
with
them

an

hue
with
pristine
clarity
before
the
yeast
pour
and
an
opaque
haze
after
thin
12
finger
shows
passable
retention
but
leaves
very
little
lace
coriander
lemon
and
wheat
in
the
nose
with
generous
belgian
wit
phenols
like
bandaid
earthy
yeast
and
banana
ester
sweet
wheat
and
sharp
pils
malt
upfront
followed
by
a
dry
and
slightly
tannic
aftertaste
that
finishes
up
with
tart
phenolics
and
mellow
herbal
hop
flavor
the
hop
bitterness
is
appropriatly
light
with
the
spice
and
sharp
pils
notes
balancing
the
mildly
sweet
wheat
and
malt
taste
the
body
is
light
and
the
carbonation
level
is
very
high
producing
an
extra
crisp
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
a
hint
of
tart
witber
phenols
and
suggestion
of
applebanana
exter
twang
the
finish
is
clean
with
spice
and
yeast
tones
that
vanish
quickly
american
beers
of
this
style
seem
more
numerous
than
those
from
its
country
of
origin
but
as
long
as
they
hold
a
high
drinkability
like
this
without
sacrificng
flavor
i
will
say
that
the
usa
is
the
best
place
to
look
for

this
a
summer
time
treat
i
thought
i
had
an
outside
chance
to
win
the
name
our
summer
seasonal
contest
that
flying
dog
ran
this
past
year
thinking
theyd
want
to
continue
the
dog
theme
i
suggested
names
such
as
tail
wagger
leash
ripper
and
white
hydrant
among
others
i
like
woody
creek
white
though
both
as
a
name
and
as
a
beer
it
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
sparse
head
citrusy
to
smell
but
not
in
an
overpowering
way
which
is
to
me
the
tragic
downfall
of
many
belgian
wits
and
with
a
briney
yeast
very
nice
the
taste
is
similarly
subtle
and
complex
without
overdoing
the
citrus
mellow
and
fresh
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
yet
playful
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
in
my
book
drinkability
a
bit
overspiced
for
my
tastes
there
are
better
witbiers
to
be

this

that
dissipates
steadily
minimal

is
evident
pleasant
aroma
of

yeast
and
coriander
light
effervescent
body
with
a
mildly
hoppy
and

flavor
that
has
touches
or
orange
and
tangerine
the
finish
is
zesty
hops
with
a
touch
of
malt
thrown
in
very
passable
overall
its
okay
but
when
blue
moon
is
more
of
a
subdued
taste
that
id
rather
have
even
the
better
ingredients
dont
save
this
one
for
me
a
clear
straw
gold
with
a
nice
big
billowy
head
strong
smells
make
me
think
saison
corriander
and
bitter
orange
are
immediately
noticable
in
the
taste
exactly
as
advertised
kudos
mouthfeel
is
smooth
hignly
quaffable
sweetens
a
bit
as
it
warms
but
that
is
the
only
detractor
that
and
the
price
10
dollars
a
sixer
is
a
bit
steep
for
something
so
sessionable
very
well
done
truly
an
extraordinary
beer
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
and
is
quite
dry
tasting
up
front
it
picks
up
some
sweetness
as
the
beer
moves
across
the
tongue
and
this
tends
to
accentuate
the
orange
peel
contributed
citrus
flavors
there
is
a
touch
of
coriander
here
in
the
flavor
though
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
aroma
would
have
suggested
this
is
fine
by
me
as
i
like
a
restrained
coriander
note
in
wits
this
is
certainly
a
tasty
example
of
a
wit
but
it
is
a
bit
too
simplistic
for
me
this
pairs
fairly
well
with
food
which
makes
it
seem
more
lemonlike
and
drier
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
a
nice
white
head
with
wide
stringing
lacing
pretty
nice
the
aroma
is
pretty
stock
wit
good
belgian
spices
of
coriander
orange
rind
wheat
malt
and
is
similar
in
the
taste
with
lemon
zest
and
clove
in
there
the
mouth
has
fine
carbonation
decent
body
really
there
isnt
anything
wrong
with
this
one
though
nothing
exceptional
drinkability
i
am
not
a
witbier
fan
but
this
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
to
me
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
very
light
in
color
and
feel
what
holds
this
brew
back
is
its
thinness
of
flavor
and
lack
of
length
across
the
tongue
this
really
just
disappears
and
the
initial
spice
and
malt
flavors
turn
watery
this
is
not
my
favorite
colorado
wit
nor
my
favorite
flying
dog
brew
take
a
pass
unless
youre
a
wit
fanatic
mildly
hazed
pale
blonde
body
with
a
small
white
head
that
leaves
scant
lacing
subtle
aroma
of
wheat
coriander
white
pepper
and
reen
bananas
light
bodied
with
zesty
carbonation
taste
is
lemony
citrus
spicy
coriander
and
pepper
wheat
and
a
hint
of
orange
lemony
citrus
finish
nicely
done
and
a
pleasant
summer
sipper
a
very
good
example
and
rare
quality
found
in
american
attempts
at
a
witbier
the
beer
hits
a
home
run
very
flavorful
but
lightly
textued
with
pepery
character
mild
hops
and
an
estery
spiciness
that
finishes
very
powdery
and
clean
but
there
are
a
few
characteristics
that
keep
it
from
becomming
a
hoegaarten
the
beer
opens
with
a
bright
yellow
golden
color
that
falls
just
short
of
bright
however
with
ideal
head
retention
and
creamy
carbonation
aromas
are
a
characterful
blend
of
wheat
malt
clean
esters
light
citrus
fruits
and
a
fresh
peppery
qualtity
the
scent
of
saison
begins
to
make
its
way
into
the
beer
after
warming
with
a
mild
must
and
earthy
scent
although
characterful
may
muddle
the
aromas
a
bit
flavors
are
equally
as
satisfying
as
aromas
a
bit
higher
hop
rate
separates
this
beer
from
belgian
counterparts
picks
up
on
more
of
a
lime
pineapple
flavor
rather
than
the
predominant
orange
flavors
that
are
typical
of
the
style
the
body
may
be
a
touch
high
but
does
not
hurt
the
drinkability
or
quality
of
the
brew
finishes
quite
clean
and
powderyclean
with
a
solid
dryness
lightly
hopped
and
warming
late
very
good
beer
it
picks
up
on
some
earthy
musty
characteristics
that
help
the
beer
as
much
as
it
hurts
about
as
good
as
an
american
wit
gets
drinkability
great
i
think
this
is
the
equivalent
of
the
beer
geeks
bud
light
light
in
body
but
not
in
flavor
also
a
great
example
of
the
style
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
despite
the
rather
odd
appearance
overall
i
generally
think
american
made
wits
flavors
are
a
bit
rigid
and
dont
meld
as
well
as
their
belgian
counterparts
but
this
one
is
much
further
along
than
most
american
versions
in
that
respect
good
appearance
a
good
balance
of
flavors
and
quite
refreshing
one
of
my
favorites
from
flying
dog
so
far
quite
an
excellent
witbier
if
it
has
a
flaw
it
is
maybe
a
little
bright
tasting
from
not
be
shipped
over
on
a
ship
highly
recommended
one
of
the
best
flying
dog
beers
aroma
contains
many
of
the
wit
characteristics
corrainder
some
citrus
yeast
spices
and
malt
things
are
a
bit
tame
here
but
nicely
blended
seems
like
a
watery
lemonade
but
the
yeast
and
hops
liven
it
up
very
easy
drinking
albeit
a
bit
thin
for
my
taste
nice
summer
brew
flavor
is
a
bit
weak
all
around
wheat
is
a
tad
thin
and
none
of
the
other
spice
cabinet
flavors
i
associate
with
the
style
maybe
a
slight
hint
of
cinnamon
or
cloves
but
i
really
had
to
dig
for
that
thin
mouthfeel
that
is
just
a
tad
watery
without
any
wheaty
heft
to
it
alright
enough
for
a
summer
day
but
not
particularly
a
prime
example
of
the
style
overall
a
very
normal
wit
not
as
full
as
a
hoegarten
but
tastes
better
crafted
than
a
blue
moon
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
would
say
this
is
a
good
example
of
one
the
taste
has
good
lemon
flavour
with
some
spice
and
wheat
and
theres
also
some
earthiness
its
pretty
noticeable
and
good
until
just
before
the
finish
when
it
drops
off
some
leaving
it
on
the
watery
side
still
this
isnt
a
bad
brew
and
its
a
welcome
drink
for
the
hot
summer
day
here
in
casper
this
beer
pours
a
clouddy
pale
whitishyellow
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
fluffy
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
coriander
and
wheat
with
a
hint
of
orange
peel
but
is
rather
faint
the
taste
is
vibrant
but
light
and
short
lived
cirtus
coriander
and
lemon
are
all
present
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
but
i
would
rather
have
a
summit
scandia
or
even
a
hoegaarden
back
pretty
hard
cloudy
lemonade
while
with
a
more
than
respectable
head
leaves
summer
clouds
and
sticky
lace
on
the
inside
edge
of
the
glass
nose
is
zesty
lemony
and
sweet
flavor
is
super
refreshing
with
a
sweet
powdery
texture
punctuated
at
the
finish
by
lemon
mouthfeel
is
clean
as
hell
and
absolutely
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
high

this
very
hot
august

with
a
chunky
frothy

up
some
sludge
it
smells
like

bitter

it

mouthfeel
that
coats
the
tongue
slight
clove
with
a
hint
of

crispy
from
the

overall
a
great
beer
to
serve
cold
on
a
swamp
ass
of
a
day
as
this
in
rochester
ny
drinkability
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
and
so
its
perfectly
sessionable
at
least
in
the
heat
of
summer
not
authentic
but
a
pretty
nice
wit
beer
it
doesnt
have
the
subtle
flavors
of
a
hoegaarden
but
theres
a
nice
spice
pepper
flavor
to
start
followed
by
smooth
wheat
with
a
bit
of
cream
i
guess
it
was
a
just
a
touch
rough
around
the
edges
but
still
satisfying
on
a
hot
summer
day
well
its
been
a
rainy
spring
here
in
da
burgh
and
this
once
makes
me
dream
of
warm
summer
days
on

noble
hoppy

with
some

and
mild

with

overall
malt
wet
wins
out

goes
down
easy

its
highly
refreshing
which
im
sure
is
the
point
the

of

is
a

not

on

like
today
i
could
take
plenty
of
these
guys
down
drinks
really
easy
not
one
of
my

styles

they
nailed
this
i

liked
this
better
than

i
had
twice

light

refreshing
a
good

at
this

the

is
fullbodied
but
not
in
a
creamy
sense
more
of
a
starchy
grainlike
texture
with
some
carbonation
too
much
black

for
me
making
it
not

smooth
as
it

be
it
hits
the

in

only
mediocre
at

imo
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
flying

i
have
ever

have
this

it
would
be
a
toss
up
next
to

fine

nice

not
nearly
the
best

out

but
better
than

as
a

offering
pretty

with

at
both
the
weak
snell
taste
in
this
highly
rated
beer
hoegaarden
and
the
like
trump
it
imo
not
a
fan
of
these
kind
of
beers
but
they
did
a
great
job
on
this
one
unique
in
that
it
has
a
very
slight
tartness
to
it
like
a
touch
of
fresh
clementine
closer
to
a
saison
than
the
kind
of
yeast
flavour
you
get
in
something
like
allagash
white
but
still
very
savory
and
wellblended
with
the
wheat
on
the
long
finish
okay
i
know
im
in
the
minority
here
but
i
found
this
beer
to
be
highly
disgusting
this
was
literally
one
of
the
worse
beers
i
have
ever
had
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
honestly
it
was
just
not
that
good
this
is
one
of
the
few
times
i
disagree
with
the
bros
i
had
this
beer
at
the
westin
inn
in
napa
ca
at
a
nice
restaurant
so
i
figured
lets
give
this
a
try
the
beer
started
off
very
promising
with
a
white
color
almost
the
color
of
toothpaste
it
had
a
very
light
aroma
but
when
i
sipped
it
thats
when
it
all
went
downhill
the
beer
tasted
like
dirty
dishwater
so
bad
i
asked
the
waiter
to
bring
me
another
i
did
not
pour
this
one
in
hopes
that
maybe
the
soapy
taste
was
a
dirty
glass
it
was
not
i
drank
the
next
one
straight
from
the
bottle
it
was
terrible
i
dont
know
what
spice
they
use
in
this
but
the
spices
simply
do
not
work
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
which
sucks
because
i
paid
10
for
it
and
i
really
wanted
to
like
it
i
normally
dont
slam
a
beer
like
this
but
this
is
putrid
o
refreshing
light
and
spritzy
like
a
soda
spices
are
present
would
go
well
on
a
hot
day
or
with
salads
light
foods
and
cold
cuts
m
this
has
a
lot
more
body
than
a
classic
wit
and
is
almost
creamy
feels
big
in
the
mouth
and
finishes
medium
dry
o
were
this
beer
classified
as
some
form
of
saison
id
be
all
about
the
sourness
thats
present
it
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
for
a
witbier
though
i
can
appreciate
why
this
is
rated
as
highly
as
it
is
given
the
tendency
towards
appreciation
for
sourswilds
and
intense
flavors
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
simple
clubyouovertheheadwithasingleflavor
beer
which
is
not
what
im
looking
for
in
any
belgian
style
not
my
favorite
wit
double
entendre
set
and
match
inoffensive
but
slightly
bland
and
dry
smooth
bottle
poured
into
a
standard
glass
at
a
sushi
restaurant
in
calgary
holy
crap
an
asian
restaurant
with
something
from
a
craft
brewer
lets
hope
that
becomes
a
trend
a
pale
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
some
rocky
sudsy
white
head
aroma
of
citrus
orange
lemon
lime
spices
clove
nutmeg
ginger
coriander
and
a
malty
depth
not
typically
observed
in
this
style
has
a
clear
lager
malt
flavor
as
well
interesting
some
bubble
gum
and
pineapple
notes
vie
with
the
aforementioned
citrus
a
brown
spice
flavor
gathers
steam
over
the
course
of
sips
nutmeg
which
is
actually
in
the
brew
according
to
the
label
moderate
body
seems
on
the
thick
side
for
the
style
with
the
carbonation
not
violent
but
certainly
assertive
finish
dry
rather
earthy
even
unique
wit
i
enjoyed
the
emphasis
on
the
malts
and
spice
my
bottle
may
have
been
a
tad
old
overall
decent
wheat
beer
certainly
better
than
blue
moon
which
seems
to
be
its
american
analogue
would
try
more
from
kiuchi
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
wits
your
yen
can
buy
i
can
only
hope
it
is
comparable
in
the
states
excellent
white
ale
a
near
perfect
mouthfeel
with
the
abv
right
where
it
ought
to
be
i
reckon
this
is
what
id
call
one
of
the
benchmarks
for
the
style
no
doot
aboot
it
a
uniquely
pleasant
aroma
and
a
deliciously
complex
and
balanced
flavor
ridiculously
drinkable
much
better
on
tap
than
out
of
the
bottle
on
tap
i
give
it
a
4
75
but
in
the
bottle
its
looser
to
a
4
overall
another
great
beer
2
for
2
with
this
brewery
cant
wait
to
try
another
this
is
one
of
the
more
delicious
and
refreshing
beverages
ive
had
this
summer
what
makes
it
even
more
impressive
is
that
the
japanese
have
jumped
on
board
with
microbrewing
and
put
this
little
gem
out
i
would
definitely
recommend
it
for
well
anything
apart
from
a
philosophical
evening
with
friends
very
happy
to
have
picked
it
up
quite
satisfied
a
pretty
famous
beer
here
it
has
eluded
me
somehow
until
now
picked
this
up
under
6
bucks
over
at
colorado
liquor
mart
who
is
still
chugging
along
with
some
hidden
gems
in
the
back
there
a
nice
take
on
a
wit
different
than
almost
all
of
them
because
of
what
i
perceive
anyway
this
fresh
ginger
in
here
a
blonde
beer
with
a
golden
flare
clear
for
the
style
and
while
there
are
a
ton
of
bubbles
in
it
no
head
really
ever
builds
up
the
nose
is
almost
like
ginger
ale
its
so
potent
to
me
i
have
to
believe
there
is
real
ginger
in
it
belgian
type
yeast
is
also
fruity
while
some
malt
other
than
wheat
i
think
makes
an
appearance
giving
some
light
caramel
flavors
as
a
base
ginger
and
cracked
pepper
in
the
finish
this
could
pass
as
a
saison
on
the
yeast
character
alone
less
belgian
than
saison
in
that
regard
super
refreshing
and
even
though
it
looks
flat
there
are
a
lot
of
bubbles
here
in
solution
my
first
beer
from
this
operation
is
a
winner
i
like
this
a
lot
different
from
the
masses
but
still
comfortably
within
what
the
style
asks
for
perfect
hot
weather
refresher
super
dig
it
wit
is
far
from
my
favorite
styles
but
this
is
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
that
ive
tried
subtle
light
and
refreshing
but
also
enriched
with
some
pleasurable
complexities
and
eccentricities
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
glass
it
has
a
golden
color
body
with
a
fizzy
head
lt
comes
off
as
a
slight
grain
aroma
the
taste
is
spot
on
it
has
a
ginger
and
slight
lemon
flavor
it
also
has
a
nice
spice
to
it
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
o
subtlety
is
the
hallmark
here
nothing
is
over
the
top
and
nothing
is
left
so
far
in
the
background
you
are
looking
slightly
funky
slightly
spicy
hints
of
citrus
all
balanced
the
light
feel
with
minimal
carbonation
makes
this
supremely
drinkable
yes
its
a
belgian
style
but
it
is
truly
japanese
in
its
subtle
refined
character
flavor
is
neutral
in
the
grain
department
thanks
to
a
healthy
load
of
wheat
in
the
mash
with
a
coriander
flavor
front
and
center
taste
profile
wise
orange
peel
comes
out
as
well
except
for
the
heavy
dose
of
carbonation
is
quite
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
as
a
witbier
i
think
the
gimmick
of
highquality
craft
brews
from
japan
that
arent
adjunct
lager
has
kind
of
worn
off
by
now
im
certainly
less
excited
about
this
now
than
i
was
when
i
first
tasted
it
years
ago
not
a
lot
of
head
and
didnt
last
too
long
but
it
was
very
drinkable
and
made
me
want
another
immediately
great
summer
beer
this
is
a
great
spicedflavored
beer
it
has
an
unfiltered
appearance
and
yeasty
smell
the
orange
and
allspice
hits
you
right
away
and
there
are
yeasty
afternotes
it
has
a
thick
mouth
feel
and
smooth
finish
no
harsh
aftertaste
and
very
little
carbonation
this
is
a
very
pleasant
springsummer
beer
and
one
that
will
definitely
find
its
way
into
my
fridge
more
often
pours
a
nice
fairly
cloudy
amber
with
a
decent
head
that
quickly
dissipates
nice
aromatic
smell
that
is
slightly
sweet
and
very
clean
nice
taste
that
is
also
slightly
sweet
i
really
enjoyed
the
smell
the
best
fantastic
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
with
lots
of
flavor
o
refreshing
a
little
funky
to
make
it
unique
well
balanced
supremely
drinkable
a
great
beer
all
around
o
having
not
had
this
for
years
i
still
feel
like
this
is
a
topnotch
wit
the
unique
flavors
of
hitachinos
ales
make
them
worth
the
extra
or
the
fizzy
head
that
totally
disappears
coupled
with
the
murky
body
detract
from
the
visual
appeal
of
this
beer
but
the
light
orange
taste
and
aroma
help
redeem
this
the
price
point
is
high
and
makes
this
a
questionable
candidate
for
multiple
drinks
overall
hitachino
nailed
this
beer
down
if
you
didnt
know
any
better
youd
think
this
was
an
authentic
whitbeir
straight
out
of
belgium
this
is
one
of
those
all
good
and
no
bad
kind
of
beers
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
this
up
you
wont
regret
it
o
overall
extremely
enjoyable
i
dont
like
citrusy
beers
but
this
one
is
done
really
well
highly
recommend
it
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
good
lacing
bright
golden
color
with
one
finger
head
light
citrus
notes
this
beer
finishes
cleaner
than
any
flavorful
beer
i
have
ever
tried
especially
of
this
style
very
sessionable
easy
to
drink
yet
very
good
flavor
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
quite
hazy
caramel
yellow
amber
with
a
half
finger
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
wheat
orange
family
citrus
herbal
bittering
flavor
is
mild
sweet
wheat
caramel
mild
fruit
and
citrus
hints
of
clove
and
belgian
yeast
flavor
tapers
off
quickly
but
leaves
a
very
pleasant
light
caramel
wheat
aftertaste
that
is
quite
satisfying
medium
bodied
with
peppery
carbonation
a
very
nice
witbier
that
is
somewhat
understated
and
almost
a
bit
overcarbonated
but
with
mellow
wheat
flavor
that
is
very
enjoyable
balanced
and
tasty
the
beer
pours
a
decent
white
and
bubbly
head
before
dissipating
quickly
but
still
leaves
a
bubbly
film
on
the
beer
the
beer
is
a
clear
pale
golden
straw
color
that
has
slight
hints
of
orange
the
beer
has
a
fairly
complex
aroma
the
smells
that
are
detected
vary
from
hints
of
apricot
honey
and
peach
along
with
a
slight
and
almost
undetectable
hint
of
citrus
hops
the
beers
taste
is
similar
to
its
smell
but
not
as
complex
the
most
dominate
taste
is
that
of
the
belgian
yeast
flavor
while
the
flavors
present
in
the
smell
are
more
subtle
the
peach
and
apricot
are
still
there
but
not
as
prominent
however
the
orangish
citrus
hops
taste
is
more
noticeable
the
beer
feels
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
the
beer
is
lightly
medium
bodied
overall
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
buy
again
rjt
poured
a
cloudy
pale
straw
with
a
thin
layer
of
head
the
nose
has
hints
of
wheat
and
yeast
along
with
something
sweet
and
floral
the
wheat
also
comes
through
in
the
flavor
profile
along
with
some
citrus
notes
this
offering
is
certainly
lightbodied
which
fits
the
style
this
is
a
tasty
but
thin
beer
that
is
worth
sampling
at
least
once
o
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
and
a
very
good
wit
i
suck
at
giving
reviews
so
i
will
keep
this
brief
kiuchi
brewery
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
since
discovered
them
many
years
ago
and
i
am
blessed
to
have
a
place
5
minutes
from
where
i
live
that
carry
quite
a
few
varieties
the
white
ale
is
my
absolute
favorite
ale
thank
god
no
one
else
buys
them
from
the
store
i
frequent
serve
cold
in
a
pint
glass
and
enjoy
poured
a
gorgeous
cloudy
yellow
with
a
three
finger
fluffy
white
head
that
stuck
around
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
as
i
drank
the
beer
true
to
style
and
very
attractive
scents
of
orange
peel
which
is
quite
pronounced
grainy
wheat
sweetness
chamomile
allspice
and
clove
fruity
and
yeasty
esters
incredibly
complex
for
a
witbier
and
extremely
pleasant
taste
begins
with
yeasty
wheat
bread
moving
into
citrus
peel
slight
peppery
spiciness
herbal
hops
and
finishing
with
wheat
cracker
and
a
strong
graininess
aftertaste
is
yeasty
and
grainy
with
some
herbal
notes
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
with
a
nice
yeasty
feel
present
as
well
overall
its
an
amazing
witbier
with
a
depth
of
complexity
in
its
aroma
that
no
other
witbier
ive
had
has
reached
and
and
an
excellent
flavor
hitting
the
wibier
style
with
a
nice
herbal
hop
character
that
adds
some
complexity
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
standard
for
the
style
but
good
its
just
a
fantastic
witbier
with
an
excellent
complexity
to
it
and
its
just
plain
pleasant
to
drink
well
worth
its
5
price
tag
an
excellent
craft
beer
out
of
japan
overall
this
beer
has
some
great
stuff
in
it
as
well
as
some
annoying
flaws
without
the
harsh
graininess
this
might
be
in
the
running
among
my
favorite
witbiers
unfortunately
its
just
a
little
too
rough
for
my
taste
o
pretty
good
brew
it
doesnt
feel
the
best
but
the
aroma
is
very
nice
and
flavor
is
good
and
refreshing
overall
not
how
i
remembered
this
beer
i
remember
thinking
it
was
absolutely
lovely
but
that
was
years
ago
the
floral
character
is
fascinating
but
the
lemon
soda
water
flavor
that
goes
along
with
it
is
not
i
could
smell
and
gaze
at
this
beer
all
day
but
i
would
rather
taste
another
o
complex
well
balanced
and
delicious
its
like
wine
in
beers
clothing
its
like
drinking
in
the
most
refined
aspects
of
a
garden
orchard
and
wheat
field
all
togther
i
love
it
and
its
a
definite
doover
wow
o
interesting
brew
worthy
of
a
try
poured
from
bottle
into
tulip
for
hitachino
bottle
tasting
fest
2013
not
much
head
golden
haze
color
spicy
yeast
with
a
lager
like
aroma
easy
wheaty
malts
and
spicey
peppery
notes
clean
and
crispand
sligtly
citrus
nice
brew
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
i
only
wish
it
represented
the
style
better
it
would
be
closer
to
a
4
if
it
were
a
little
spicier
but
right
now
its
closer
to
a
3
75
o
i
enjoyed
it
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
this
is
very
good
recommend
it
o
hoegaarden
and
blue
moon
put
me
off
witbier
for
years
but
a
mate
bought
one
of
these
for
me
and
ive
found
it
very
refreshing
this
was
a
quite
pleasant
surprise
very
original
and
refreshing
differs
from
belgian
wittier
given
its
sourness
and
the
predominant
green
grapes
taste
you
got
to
try
it
o
one
of
the
best
wits
i
have
had
not
great
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
o
great
beer
very
interesting
tastes
that
i
dont
usually
run
into
a
great
change
of
pace
from
your
everyday
american
beers
a
little
pricey
but
damn
good
and
super
unique
the
flavor
brings
up
the
pepper
an
expressive
orange
juice
one
of
the
ingredients
here
and
a
little
bit
of
honey
the
body
is
light
superrefreshing
with
a
great
carbonation
amazing
wonderful
witbier
overall
this
beer
was
a
pleasant
beer
found
on
a
great
trip
to
chicago
over
6
years
ago
that
leaves
me
returning
to
kiuchi
brewery
beers
every
chance
i
can
oa
fantastically
refreshing
beer
provides
just
a
glint
of
sweetness
and
a
sassy
bit
of
spice
and
pepper
without
overwhelming
the
palate
refined
clean
and
delicious
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
one
of
the
best
witbeirs
ive
had
would
buy
this
again
if
it
were
the
same
price
as
hoegaarden
but
since
its
double
the
price
where
i
am
and
not
easy
to
find
ill
pass
pours
a
murky
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
partial
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
spices
and
yeast
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
fruity
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
really
good
i
wish
i
could
have
enjoyed
it
better
if
it
wasnt
for
my
acid
reflux
i
have
always
been
a
fan
of
japanese
beer
and
belgian
whites
little
did
i
know
that
i
could
have
both
in
the
same
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
trying
this
beer
if
you
have
the
chance
and
enjoy
mild
to
medium
flavored
full
bodied
beers
or
are
a
fan
of
either
style
overall
really
happy
about
this
brew
good
beer
can
be
found
all
over
the
world
the
aftertaste
is
wonderful
i
wish
i
had
five
or
six
of
these
to
guzzle
but
for
4
99
a
bottle
it
is
a
luxury
i
will
have
to
forgo
there
are
other
less
expensive
representatives
of
the
style
that
make
more
sense
but
there
isnt
anything
here
i
could
fault
outside
of
the
price
aside
mrs

of

tasted
like
apricot

overall
a
very
interesting
take
on

you
get
what
you

for

i
feel
very
happy
to
be
drinking
this
one
way
up
there
on
the
list
of
top
witbiers
truly
fantastic
the
bizarre
part
about
this
beer
is
despite
it
blowing
me
away
in
its
category
its
not
by
any
means
a
perfect
beer
and
you
know
what
any
sloppiness
it
may
have
only
makes
the
drinking
experience
more
fun
this
is
really
worth
checking
out
for
the
flavorful
yeast
alone
you
can
just
taste
the
vitamins
and
nutrients
they
carry
in
the
aftertaste
and
the
vivid
tartiness
is
unlike
any
wit
bier
ive
ever
had
despite
the
price
tag
over
6
id
say
its
a
beer
that
id
revisit
again
welcoming
in
every
way
its
guaranteed
to
improve
your
day
with
every
sip
just
as
it
did
for
me
this
has
become
my
summer

supremely

it

top

as
good
as
any
wit
from
belgium
hn
on
point
overall
this
is
the
first
japanese
beer
that
tastes
great
and
not
something
flavorless
the
aroma
was
odd
at
first
but
its
still
a
great
example
of
a
beligum
wit
originally
reviewed

a
nice
refreshing
ale
not
much
in
the
body
nothing
outstanding
in
the
flavor
different
than
a
lot
of
witbiers
ive
had
with
the
citrus
overall
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
tried
i
expected
something
decent
from
hitachino
but
this
was
much
more
a
must
try
if
you
are
looking
to
expand
your
horizons
o
very
refreshing
very
enjoyable
and
very

i
have
had
this

many
times
over

pours
a

bright
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
which
goes
away
to
nothing
fast
there
is
no
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
aroma
draws
you
in
before
you
bring
your
nose
to
the
glass
you
can
smell
this
beer
the
nose
is
of
big
time
citurs
orange
and
a
big
lemon
part
there
is
also
a
hint
of
pepper
the
taste
follows
suit
with
a
big
and
smooth
sweet
citrus
taste
with
orange
and
lemon
taking
the
front
and
middle
a
little
pepper
spice
comes
in
at
the
back
end
with
a
slight
tartness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
and
you
want
more
of
this
beer
a
great
take
on
the
style
this
is
the
second
beer
from
hitachino
nest
that
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
imbibing
the
first
being
red
rice
ale
and
i
can
report
nothing
but
pleasant
results
thus
far
it
is
a
bit
pricy
for
regular
consumption
but
as
a
beer
that
is
on
the
heaviest
side
of
refreshing
this
makes
for
an
excellent
treat
in
these
days
of
record
high
spring
temperatures
i
can
wholeheartedly
recommend
this
to
both
witbier
fans
as
well
as
those
wondering
what
the
hell
the
architects
of
sunset
wheat
were
thinking
pours

very
little

evolves
into

close
virtually
no
bitter
some

very
light
flavorful
tasty
easy
drinker

not

nice

abv
makes
it
very
sessionable
seek
this
out
it
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
japanese
brewing
company
very
well
done
quality
brew
overall
so
refreshing
perfect
for
summer
and
one
that
just
about
anyone
could
appreciate
and
enjoy
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
theres
lots
of
carbonation
present
theres
an
slight
pleasing
aroma
of
citrus
black
pepper
and
bread
the
taste
wow
its
a
pleasing
slightly
sweet
citrus
flavor
with
a
creamy
texture
on
the
first
sip
the
black
pepper
hits
you
as
well
as
the
grain
on
the
way
down
all
the
flavors
shine
through
and
are
perfectly
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
and
the
carbonation
aids
greatly
in
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
i
could
see
myself
buying
this
again
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
likes
a
good
witbier
o
id
love
it
if
this
were
a
bit
less
expensive
as
i
would
drink
it
all
summer
long
im
impressed
with
the
mouthfeel
and
texture
here
above
everything
else
but
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
witbier
i
knew
this
was
a
highly
rated
japanese
beer
when
i
bought
it
but
wow
was
all
i
could
say
when
i
tasted
it
that
awesome
smell
came
through
in
the
taste
near
perfect
white
beer
im
going
to
be
buying
this
beer
again
and
again
it
will
now
be
my
ideal
summer
white
beer
bottle
lovely
turbid
pale
golden
pour
with
2finger
fluffy
white
head
on
this
noce
aroma
of
hopcitrus
and
spices
up
front
including
cloves
and
orange
zest
the
palate
is
extremely
smooth
with
the
aforementioned
hopcitrus
clove
and
orange
zest
flavors
and
the
beer
picking
up
some
apparent
palate
heft
and
complexity
as
it
warms
up
a
little
and
the
flavors
marry
a
bit
this
one
is
great
beer
from
kiuchi
brewery
o
more
complex
than
most
witbiers
i
have
tried
but
the
price
6
for
a
12
oz
would
keep
me
from
trying
again
it
was
good
so
i
dont
feel
it
was
a
waste
though
this
is
my
first
beer
from
kiuchi
and
i
must
say
it
will
not
be
my
last
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
has
a
nice
floral
and
citrusy
aroma
to
it
with
the
fresh
wheat
aromas
on
the
nose
the
taste
of
the
beer
has
some
interesting
lemon
flavors
to
it
with
the
subtle
wheat
coming
through
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
light
bodied
a
refreshing
brew
for
sure
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
i
feel
its
a
little
hyped
up
but
maybe
thats
just
me
overall
ive
had
a
few
white
ales
cross
my
palate
and
ive
become
disappointed
by
anything
outside
of
belgium
american
white
ales
are
lacking
the
warm
spicy
flavors
that
are
typically
associated
with
a
belgian
wit
most
american
whites
i
try
are
very
light
in
body
and
taste
this
japanese
white
ale
has
reassured
me
that
i
dont
need
to
stick
with
the
belgians
to
get
a
quality
white
ale
i
dont
know
why
it
has
taken
me
so
long
to
try
this
i
see
it
in
a
lot
of
places
a
travel
to
just
never
pulled
the
trigger
a
very
nice
wit
and
one
i
will
not
neglect
to
purchase
in
the
future
cheers
o
light
and
not
overly
sweet
a
pleasant
surprise
body
seems
a
bit
thick
i
would
have
like
it
to
be
more
spritzy
and
refreshing
overall
this
beer
isnt
anything
special
a
step
up
from
blue
moon
would
go
well
with
some
sushi
can
easily
beat
blue
moon
head
to
head
o
once
again
hitachino
nest
creates
another
masterpiece
of
an
ale
ive
never
had
anything
quite
like
this
its
like
theyve
been
creating
ale
in
a
whole
different
universe
without
any
input
from
ours
just
obscenely
good
stuff
o
this
beer
was
great
from
top
to
bottom
this
was
by
far
my
favorite
witbier
i
tried
overall
i
really
like
this
i
have
a
specific
flavor
profile
basically
allagash
whites
flavor
that
i
look
for
when
drinking
whites
and
generally
cant
stand
whites
that
dont
match
up
which
is
almost
all
of
them
this
beer
has
a
different
taste
though
and
is
making
me
rethink
that
approach
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
is
nicely
drinkable
with
a
full
flavor
that
will
have
you
coming
back
o
overall
its
a
great
beer
great
interpretation
of
the
style
and
from
japan
no
less
i
loved
the
spice
the
only
thing
that
wasnt
working
for
me
was
the
unusally
clear
color
and
mouthfeel
ive
seen
the
hitachino
beers
around
and
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
the
rest
of
the
line
overall
a
beautiful
aroma
and
a
good
but
not
outstanding
flavor
i
would
drink
it
again
just
because
its
interesting
enough
but
considering
this
is
an
asian
brewery
its
really
impressive
and
mostly
i
think
it
just
makes
me
want
to
see
what
their
other
beers
are
like
o
this
is
a
seriously
impressive
beer
a
solid
take
on
the
style
but
with
a
very
distinctive
flavor
of
its
own
this
is
easily
the
best
asian
beer
ive
had
in
well
maybe
ever
respect
this
beer
i
really
liked
this
one
would
not
hesitate
to
have
another
i
tired
this
one
at
a
local
beer
bar
called
stubbies
and
steins
served
in
its
own
glassware
poured
a
cloudy
burnt
orange
color
smelled
lively
with
orange
peel
and
coriander
notes
the
taste
was
fantastic
nothing
i
have
ever
had
before
very
unique
and
complex
seems
like
coirander
and
some
kind
of
candied
fruit
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
and
a
hint
of
white
pepper
in
the
finish
very
refreshing
and
a
welcomed
change
to
the
typical
witbier
o
a
sessionable
quality
though
fairly
simple
noncomplex
witbier
i
would
drink
this
again
although
it
would
be
tough
to
justify
given
the
price
point
about
5
50
for
a
12oz
at
whole
foods
o
a
very
nice
witbier
and
my
first
beer
from
kiuchi
easy
drinking
and
went
very
well
with
the
food
i
ordered
what
is
that
flavor
ok
first
it
tastes
like
tea
on
the
back
half
there
is
a
earthy
sulfurness
to
the
midpalate
the
lead
off
is
a
light
bodied
and
sweet
beer
almost
like
chai
it
has
this
nutmeg
corriander
flavor
that
dominates
the
finish
the
finish
is
a
little
too
dry
i
dont
know
i
know
these
are
suppose
to
be
spiced
sometimes
and
dry
but
this
is
too
spiced
and
too
dry
for
me
not
my
favorite
witbier
i
love
this
white
ale
tastes
waaaay
better
than
hoeegarden
and
im
standing
by
that
accusation
it
has
so
much
flavor
and
the
right
amount
of
hops
and
cloves
brilliant
beer
i
really
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
trying
white
ales
for
the
first
time
or
fans
of
it
truly
a
delicious
drink
o
im
impressed
probably
the
first
japanese
beer
ive
really
enjoyed
what
a
delight
to
drink
this
is
a
very
interesting
witbier
packed
different
flavors
including
a
bit
too
liberal
for
me
dose
of
nutmeg
its
still
a
fantastic
wit
worth
seeking
out
poured
into
a
zero
gravity
pilsner
glass
a
cloudy
bronzed
yellow
with
a
finger
of
foamy
white
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
layer
typical
wheaty
aroma
with
hints
of
orange
and
lemon
zest
and
a
bit
of
spice
crisp
wheat
profile
on
the
tongue
citrus
zest
and
piney
hops
just
the
right
amount
of
peppery
spice
dry
and
slightly
bitter
in
the
finish
light
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
white
beers
but
my
wife
loves
them
so
i
get
a
chance
to
sample
a
few
this
one
is
clearly
the
best
ive
had
and
certainly
a
class
above
the
hoegaarden
flagship
all
in
all
a
very
good
example
of
a
traditional
european
witbier
and
the
first
i
have
enjoyed
from
japan
would
like
to
find
more
of
hitachinos
products
drink
45
a
good
example
of
a
witbier
thats
experimented
with
the
spicing
i
would
have
liked
to
have
gotten
a
bit
more
of
the
nutmeg
and
coriander
though
highly
drinkable
and
refreshing
comes
out
a
nice
hazy
yellow
with
a
pure
white
head
about
a
finger
thick
pretty
good
retention
the
nose
is
a
combination
of
floral
and
spice
notes
with
a
wheat
backbone
getting
coriander
lemon
zest
a
hint
of
orange
peel
as
well
in
the
spices
taste
is
running
down
a
similar
path
coriander
orange
peel
and
lemon
zest
with
a
wheat
backdrop
its
a
damn
fine
combination
too
coriander
might
be
too
much
for
some
but
i
think
its
perfect
light
bodied
with
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
and
some
nice
hop
bite
at
the
end
quite
a
tasty
brew
and
worthy
of
the
price
o
a
truly
elegant
witbier
complex
yet
graceful
and
modest
in
its
presentation
to
both
eyes
and
mouth
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
could
see
myself
revisiting
multiple
times
in
the
future
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
7
2011
after
purchasing
from
the
queens
quay
lcbo
outlet
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
colour
with
a
half
inch
snow
white
head
the
aroma
was
wheat
malt
and
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
is
wheat
coriander
and
citrus
and
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
and
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
for
a
while
i
can
actually
remember
in
2005
having
this
for
the
first
time
even
though
i
was
not
into
craft
beer
or
beer
reviewing
at
the
time
i
may
not
always
drink
witbier
but
when
i
do
i
prefer
hitachino
nest
white
ale
would
make
a
great
meal
compliment
or
patio
beer
but
its
not
something
id
pick
up
regularly
leaves
my
mouth
a
bit
too
dry
to
consider
it
refreshing
and
its
just
a
bit
overpriced
in
my
opinion
d
great
stuff
like
this
for
a
light
witbier
and
would
make
a
great
summertime
drink
it
has
become
so
popular
that
its
hard
to
get
a
hold
of
i
had
this
many
years
ago
and
was
always
a
fan
of
the
hitachino
brand
of
beers
glad
to
see
its
getting
the
recognition
it
deserves
o
on
one
hand
this
is
a
light
and
easy
drinker
on
the
other
hand
the
smellstastes
are
so
pure
it
stands
out
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
i
also
found
the
mouthfeel
a
little
heavy
even
kind
of
soapy
without
a
crispness
i
wanted
and
ultimately
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
the
beer
againthere
are
much
better
wits
out
there
pours
straw
yellowthe
same
color
as
a
macro
but
oh
so
much
more
gorgeous
fluffy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
no
lacing
but
enticing
bubbles
throughout
nose
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
ginger
being
the
most
evocative
note
the
taste
is
light
and
elegant
the
wheat
fruit
notes
playing
off
the
supremely
light
bubbly
feel
and
back
again
excellent
beer
overall
especially
in
the
summer
months
looking
forward
to
checking
out
other
offerings
from
this
brewery
overall
very
impressed
by
this
one
to
be
honest
i
like
wheat
beers
where
that
spice
flavour
is
not
overpowering
and
well
balanced
by
all
the
other
aspects
that
are
supposed
to
be
in
a
quality
wheat
beer
and
this
one
really
delivered
on
all
those
aspects
there
is
a
nice
spice
presence
right
off
the
bat
but
it
is
quickly
balanced
by
that
great
bready
wheat
flavour
hints
of
citrusy
fruits
and
a
perfect
amount
of
yeast
in
there
as
well
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
and
crisp
happy
i
picked
up
a
few
of
these
because
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
pour
cloudy
golden
with
a
half
a
fingers
worth
of
head
light
carbonation
very
floral
with
the
sent
of
a
peach
taste
of
a
clementine
with
a
lingering
sweet
peach
then
orange
peel
finish
this
is
a
soft
beer
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
would
go
down
fast
overall
i
would
like
to
see
more
head
but
this
was
a
great
beer
with
great
flavours
and
smooth
finish
final
thoughts
an
all
around
well
rounded
beer
sure
it
has
a
couple
of
notes
that
dont
ring
true
with
me
but
they
are
so
minor
i
wouldnt
mention
them
outside
a
review
you
will
want
to
pick
this
one
up
the
creepy
owl
impresses
again
overall
a
solid
beer
overall
a
solid
whit
certainly
not
my
favorite
though
i
opted
for
two
bros
ebels
weiss
after
finishing
this
beer
i
expected
more
form
such
a
highly
rated
beer
ive
been
saying
that
a
lot
lately
undeniably
a
strong
whit
thick
carbonated
mouthfeel
exceptionally
drinkable
the
best
japanese
beer
ive
ever
had
and
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
ever
tried
i
hope
this
is
a
regular
at
the
lcbo
pours
a
cloudy
light
yellow
with
a
bright
white
bubbly
head
that
sticks
around
nose
is
orange
lemon
citrus
peel
distinct
yeast
grass
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
a
mellow
representation
of
the
smell
not
so
much
pinesol
now
its
crisp
and
light
and
yields
some
of
that
belgian
like
yeast
throughout
light
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
witbier
good
for
summer
days
but
priced
to
high
since
its
expensive
to
get
here
o
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
had
this
and
my
memories
havent
faded
with
how
good
i
thought
it
was
this
new
bottle
today
is
drinking
wonderful
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
and
is
worth
getting
to
try
sometime
very
pale
hazy
blonde
light
ring
of
white

no
lacing
left
behind
smell
is
yeasty
with
orange
notes
banana

coriander
nutmeg
faint

is
yeasty
up

with
spicy
orange
light
banana
coriander
and
a
orangey
citrus
finish
light
mouthfeel
med
to
high
carbonation
refreshing
and
pretty
solid
overall
this
was
quite
good
i
dont
love
the
style
but
i
did
enjoy
this
t
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
orange
with
a
finger
or
so
of
offwhite
head
head
falls
to
a
thin
layer
nose
has
wheat
lots
of
nutmeg
and
a
hint
of
citrus
zest
taste
has
about
the
same
citrus
zest
and
abit
of
spritzy
carbonation
upfront
before
a
bit
of
softer
wheat
character
come
through
with
more
nutmeg
simple
in
most
respects
but
adequate
proportions
of
the
components
make
this
a
nice
drinker
carbonation
is
medium
high
and
most
evident
at
the
beginning
of
each
sip
refreshing
and
quite
a
nice
wit
d
an
excellent
witbier
true
to
style
yet
distinctive
the
rich
flavour
is
wellbalanced
by
crisp
carbonation
making
it
a
delicious
and
refreshing
brew
perfect
for
summer
afternoons
pale
yellow
and
turbid
pouring
produces
a
finger
of
pale
white
head
that
retains
poorly
and
doesnt
lace
lots
of
nutmeg
in
the
aroma
less
coriander
than
nutmeg
but
still
a
lot
of
that
as
well
citrus
scents
are
muted
providing
more
of
an
underlying
background
for
the
spices
flavour
is
tangy
and
lemony
with
a
hint
of
orange
and
strong
spice
notes
mild
bitterness
the
coriander
is
much
more
assertive
on
the
tongue
than
it
is
on
the
nose
lightbodied
with
a
tonne
of
tiny
bubbles
giving
it
a
spritzy
texture
this
is
a
well
made
wit
though
my
personal
preference
is
for
something
a
little
more
heavyhanded
with
the
orange
and
a
lighter
touch
with
the
spices
i
find
this
to
be
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
light
peppery
and
balanced
a
refreshing
wit
im
liking
this
more
as
i
drink
it
i
was
thinking
at
first
that
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
mostly
because
of
price
but
now
im
not
so
sure
would
go
well
with
a
warm
summer
day
thats
for
sure
worth
checking
out
solid
and
interesting
but
probably
better
on
a
hot
day
not
a
rainy
damp
one
finish
short
and
clean
the
tartness
of
the
lemon
zest
and
sweetness
of
the
orange
juice
finishes
strong
and
truly
stand
out
not
that
complex
but
nicely
layered
and
refreshing
m
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
the
wheat
flavor
is
really
nice
dies
off
a
bit
toward
the
end
to
finish
with
a
thinner
feel
if
i
ignore
all
those
bigname
rice
lagers
i
can
fortunately
claim
this
to
be
my
first
real
beer
from
japan
and
what
an
entry
this
was
were
the
price
a
touch
lower
id
drink
this
all
summer
as
it
is
ill
at
least
try
to
keep
coming
back
to
it
great
stuff
o
an
excellent
witbier
tasteless
jokes
aside
this
brewery
has
done
a
tremendously
good
thing
by
temporarily
shifting
over
their
bottling
capacity
to
supply
water
to
the
earthquake
victims
not
only
do
they
make
great
beer
but
theyre
great
people
as
well
though
that
does
mean
ill
be
hoarding
any
bottles
of
this
nectar
i
come
across
until
japan
achieves
normality
overall
a
very
enjoyable
wit
i
find
the
orange
flavour
to
be
a
bit
too
much
at
times
but
the
flavours
are
generally
incredibly
well
blended
and
make
for
a
great
combo
would
not
be
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
go
overall
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
im
not
sure
that
its
that
much
better
than
most
of
the
other
wit
beers
out
there
also
it
was
a
bit
on
the
pricey
side
im
happy
i
got
to
try
it
but
i
think
id
buy
hoegaarden
for
half
the
price
the
next
time
im
in
the
mood
for
a
witbier
ofantastic
beer
i
liked
this
alot
top
wheat
beer
imo
nice
carbonation
typical
of
the
style
dry
and
overall
a
very
nice
japanese
white
ale
to
be
honest
i
drank
two
in
a
row
but
i
really
dont
see
why
it
gets
all
this
praise
not
sure
if
im
just
not
getting
it
or
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
it
probably
could
have
been
fresher
the
lcbo
seemed
to
have
held
onto
it
for
quite
some
time
ill
have
to
give
it
another
try
some
other
time
hitachino
nest
white
ale
is
topnotch
witbier
while
there
are
a
couple
examples
i
have
rated
higher
this
brewery
has
undoubtedly
characterized
the
style
to
near
perfection
and
even
put
their
own
slightly
unique
stamp
on
it
since
it
contains
orange
juice
does
that
mean
i
can
make
it
part
of
my
breakfast
hell
ill
find
any
excuse
to
drink
this
stuff
more
lemony
and
grassy
than
any
other
witbier
i
have
had
and
easily
the
best
and
most
moreishly
drinkable
of
them
all
this
is
a
very
different
and
very
tasty
beer
overall
this
is
an
excellent
wheat
beer
and
it
certainly
stands
up
to
some
of
the
other
excellent
examples
we
have
available
year
round
in
ontario
o
super
smooth
and
supremely
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
every
day
this
summer
if
it
were
a
bit
cheaper
i
will
definitely
pick
up
again
in
the
coming
summer
weeks
regardless
definitely
recommended
and
a
huge
pleasant
surprise
out
of
japan
after
delays
this
finally
came
to
ontario
not
sure
if
delays
were
lcbos
fault
or
somehow
related
to
the
situation
in
japan
either
way
im
glad
it
is
finally
in
my
glass
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
colour
with
thick
white
head
head
dissipates
to
a
thin
ring
mild
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
nutmeg
and
orange
peel
with
the
wheat
aroma
sweet
flavour
slightly
tart
in
the
aftertaste
this
is
quite
refreshing
finishes
dry
slightly
tart
and
remains
very
light
this
is
a
damn
fine
witbier
and
absolutely
great
on
all
counts
pale
white
with
less
than
a
finger
of
head
smelled
like
aome
fruit
maybe
some
oranges
and
apples
very
interesting
tasted
not
unlike
liiight
orange
not
malty
hoppy
or
any
notes
of
those
maybe
a
bit
resiny
mouthfeel
was
lacking
in
my
opinion
i
like
a
thicker
witbier
and
this
feel
short
with
quite
a
thin
palate
overall
i
liked
it
enough
to
give
it
an
b
the
mouth
feel
was
average
but
everything
else
has
me
have
hope
for
those
japanese
breweries
this
is
an
outstanding
bier
to
sample
periodically
but
limited
due
to
cost
not
my
favorite
looking
beer
pale
yellow
with
little
head
developing
at
all
even
with
a
swirl
otherwise
this
is
a
very
interesting
and
good
beer
nose
has
an
almost
tealike
quality
to
it
from
what
my
guess
would
be
whatever
spices
or
hops
they
use
in
this
flavor
is
refreshing
fruity
sweet
and
spicy
all
at
once
a
nice
flavorful
witbier
here
for
sure
it
tastes
more
like
the
european
witbiers
that
ive
had
than
their
american
imitations
very
drinkable
and
super
flavorful
for
a
5
beer
i
have
to
try
more
from
this
brewery
really
a
wonderful
brew
recommended
im
looking
forward
to
trying
other
nest
beer
one
of
the
more
floralperfumey
examples
of
the
style
ive
sampled
very
drinkable
but
missing
a
little
something
derived
from
yeast
compared
to
the
best
examples
d
refreshingly
drinkable
probably
the
best
belgian
style
wit
ive
had
almost
thirst
quenching
notes
one
of
the
best
and
unique
witbiers
ive
had
love
the
intensity
of
the
ingredients
d
highly
drinkable
perhaps
sessionable
three
or
four
would
be
easy
to
do
this
may
become
a
beer
i
keep
around
in
the
fridge
for
those
nights
where
i
want
to
kick
a
few
back
on
the
lighter
end
of
medium
bodied
with
a
blast
of
peppery
coriander
spice
that
lingers
throughout
into
a
slight
dry
finish
there
is
a
decent
breadyeast
presence
that
adds
to
the
mouthfeel
as
well
as
some
slight
banana
and
citrus
flavor
as
the
palate
adjusts
to
the
spice
there
is
a
prominent
lemon
juicerind
character
that
balances
things
out
a
bit
slightly
tart
and
refreshing
making
it
pretty
quaffable
a
good
attempt
at
the
style
but
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
spice
for
my
liking
pours
a
light
haze
paleoff
yellow
with
some
carbonation
this
smells
fantastic
sour
and
malt
aromas
cut
through
mostly
very
fresh
light
silky
sweet
malt
flavors
some
lemonlight
citrus
flavors
come
first
followed
by
some
grainorange
peel
flavors
provide
a
really
nice
finish
this
would
go
perfect
with
any
asian
dish
you
make
while
theres
some
carbonation
i
tend
to
feel
like
its
nat
as
potent
as
the
belgian
counterpart
comments
as
a
variation
of
the
wit
style
hitachino
nest
white
is
undoubtedly
original
i
like
that
the
brewer
takes
risks
many
of
them
paying
off
its
mouthfeel
is
fresh
and
smooth
plus
the
appearance
is
delightful
but
the
intense
spice
profile
is
a
couple
notches
too
high
overall
it
is
a
pleasant
ale
with
one
noticeable
flaw
a
tart
burst
of
citrus
lemon
juice
and
orange
zest
greets
the
nose
backed
up
with
cloves
tangy
wheat
and
tangy
yeast
tastes
much
like
it
smells
with
the
additions
of
brief
moments
of
earthiness
and
a
lemonlime
soda
sweet
character
a
bit
of
a
bandaid
aftertaste
particularly
as
it
gets
warmer
but
not
enough
to
be
too
distracting
light
and
almost
wispy
on
the
tongue
with
a
clean
finish
it
made
a
pretty
nice
match
for
the
sushi
overall
very
impressed
with
this
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
the
brewery
or
the
beer
but
definitely
recommend
it
if
you
come
across
overall
definately
an
unconventional
but
pleasing
wit
drinks
like
a
pilsner
just
has
no
wheat
character
i
applaud
it
for
not
being
over
the
top
w
coriander
if
its
there
at
all
a
very
good
witbier
and
probably
my
favorite
beer
in
general
sorry
but
the
charms
of
this
beer
totally
escape
me
and
its
the
2nd
kind
ive
tried
from
the
brewery
and
im
just
not
getting
it
poured
a
large
3
white
head
smells
like
a
sour
beer
taste
is
a
little
sour
and
theres
really
not
much
else
to
it
bad
sample
maybe
but
trader
joes
has
a
high
turnover
of
this
stuff
so
i
doubt
my
sample
sat
around
too
long
buy
this
i
love
this
brewery
so
far
most
everything
ive
had
from
them
is
artfully
produced
and
well
worth
a
try
this
is
the
flagship
beer
of
kiuchi
brewery
and
with
the
light
body
that
suitably
flows
underneath
lovely
bubbling
its
understandable
why
the
japanquest
is
happily
underway
great
summer
beer
very
sessionable
also
fine
craft
beer
starter
for
a
newbie
d
a
very
interesting
beer
definitely
enjoyed
drinking
this
one
and
could
go
for
a
few
more
drinkability
pretty
tasty
but
complex
and
rich
still
an
easy
drink
and
sits
well
with
me
definitely
not
a
sweet
wit
but
a
spicy
one
however
the
orange
character
is
still
there
and
this
one
goes
down
extremely
easily
recommended
d
interesting
blend
of
spices
manifesting
in
the
nose
and
on
the
palate
refreshing
and
drinkable
as
a
witbier
should
be
but
guess
id
prefer
it
a
tad
less
sour
4
feel
this
beer
is
great
very
complex
with
a
light
and
super
creamy
body
that
goes
down
really
well
d
really
an
easy
drinker
that
behaved
more
like
a
summer
lager
than
an
ale
the
citrus
notes
can
be
a
real
crowd
pleaser
i
highly
recommend
this
with
sashimi
or
oysters
on
the
half
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
good
i
would
have
no
trouble
having
a
couple
of
these
a
very
drinkable
wit
definatly
worth
a
try
just
as
good
if
not
better
than
most
belgians
pours
a
very
hazed
orange
yellow
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
white
head
and
a
really
good
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
oranges
yeast
spice
and
wheat
tastes
of
oranges
spice
coriander
and
maybe
black
pepper
wheat
and
a
little
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
body
and
substantial

high
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
citrusy
scent
along
with
a
bit
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
spice
its
light
and
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
very
drinkable
pale
and
wheat
malt
flavor
light
and
refreshing
the
citrusy
flavor
is
outstanding
along
with
a
dry
and
fruity
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
good
witbier
its
winter
now
id
rather
be
drinking
this
while
enjoying
a
nice
sunny
day
notes
goes
amazing
with
food
crisp
refreshing
tangy
and
tons
of
palette
scrubbing
bubbles
and
incredibly
drinkable
goes
down
easy
drinkability
quite
liked
this
one
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
good
flavors
the
price
point
is
a
bit
high
but
this
is
a
quality
brew
went
down
quickly
drinkability
at
this
simple
abv
is
highly
desirable
overall
a
very
tasty
if
not
altogether
unique
white
beer
d
mild
and
very
drinkable
drinkability
very
high
and
the
low
abv
keeps
it
from
being
too
dangerous
perfect
for
a
summer
day
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
with
some
weird
date
coding
into
my
ommegang
goblet
very
cloudy
grapefruit
juice
colored
with
about
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
smells
very
lemony
and
spicy
very
appealing
nose
flavors
are
what
youd
expect
from
a
wit
though
leaning
towards
lemon
rather
than
orange
nice
gingerbread
cookie
like
finish
lingers
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
great
example
of
the
style
notes
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
belgian
style
brewed
apparently
in
japan
this
is
easily
the
best
beer
that
i
have
ever
had
which
was
brewed
in
japan
if
you
love
grapefruit
you
may
love
this
wit
bier
there
is
only
a
minor
hint
of
bitterness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
d
this
was
an
amazing
drinkable
beer
first
time
i
have
had
something
from
this
company
and
i
was
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
have
it
do
yourself
a
favor
and
try
this
beer
if
you
havent
already
this
is
one
ill
return
to
again
and
again
it
never
gets
old
to
me
this
is
unique
and
eyeopening
especially
if
you
think
youve
tried
every
witbier
out
there
give
it
a
try
with
an
open
mind
theres
a
nice
mediumbodied
creaminess
to
it
but
it
might
be
one
of
those
white
beers
that
could
benefit
from
a
slice
of
orange
i
have
a
rule
that
states
that
if
you
need
to
put
a
piece
of
fruit
in
your
beer
to
make
it
taste
better
then
just
drink
a
beer
that
tastes
better
that
said
ill
drink
a
different
beer
a
witbeer
from
japan
oh
i
have
to
try
that
be
forewarned
that
this
is
no
typical
belgian
wit
it
is
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
goes
to
nice
lacing
with
nice
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
spice
and
slight
fruit
the
flavor
is
vell
spiced
dominated
some
citrus
at
the
end
a
top
notch
wheat
brew
from
japan
im
no
brewer
but
what
is
so
hard
about
making
a
witbier
ím
sure
its
not
easy
but
no
one
seems
to
be
able
to
match
and
defintely
not
surpass
hoegaarden
having
said
that
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
the
only
major
letdown
for
this
is
the
coriander
is
way
too
much
out
in
front
on
the
nose
and
the
palate
however
i
love
coriander
so
on
a
personal
level
i
dont
mind
this
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
wellbalanced
traditional
wit
it
may
be
a
let
down
carbonation
and
look
are
very
good
though
soo
close
tasted
from
bottle
at
lush
roscoe
pours
pale
orange
with
a
thin
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
leaving
minimal
lace
around
the
glass
nose
of
yeast
orange
and
spices
including
coriander
cinnamon
and
a
hint
of
nutmeg
the
orange
flavors
come
through
nicely
with
the
spices
mostly
subdued
until
the
back
where
nutmeg
coriander
and
a
hint
of
cardamom
come
through
the
body
is
light
with
average
carbonation
an
oily
texture
and
a
medium
spiced
finish
tangy
and
refreshing
great
for
a
hot
day
overall
hn
white
ale
is
an
extremely
unique
beer
in
that
it
tastes
like
five
alive
without
the
sweetness
bold
and
unusual
flavours
with
tons
of
character
this
is
what
good
craft
beer
is
all
about
a
soft
and
compelling
summer
drink
went
well
with
seafood
barbecue
mouthfeel
is
light
but
nicely
carbonated
very
refreshing
highly
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
day
a
masterful
white
ale
i
would
love
to
find
this
on
tap
poured
a
bright
hazy
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
white
fizzy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
a
light
white
cap
very
wet
lacings
that
have
no
chance
at
sticking
to
the
glass
a
variety
of
aromas
lemon
orange
wheat
and
spice
the
citrus
lemon
being
the
most
dominant
but
not
so
much
the
other
aromas
dont
come
through
big
citrus
flavor
again
with
lemon
and
orange
flavors
up
front
a
solid
wheat
body
and
spicy
clean
finish
a
very
refreshing
ale
particularly
on
the
hot
day
that
it
was
sampled
easy
to
drink
d
the
beer
is
very
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
slightly
more
texture
and
flavor
than
an
american
pilsner
but
comparable
in
overall
experience
d
very
drinkable
good
wit
interesting
touches
not
too
strong
in
any
direction
i
am
a
devout
craft
beer
drinker
and
have
recently
begun
to
explore
some
interesting
asian
crafts
i
was
originally
introduced
to
this
beer
at
a
wine
bar
and
it
was
paired
with
a
hearty
artisan
mac
and
cheese
the
bottle
itself
is
interesting
but
once
you
smell
the
aroma
you
know
you
are
in
for
a
treat
because
it
is
loaded
with
hints
of
citrus
sourdough
bread
and
spice
it
is
like
smelling
summer
the
color
of
the
beer
is
what
it
is
to
be
expected
cloudy
pale
yellow
and
obviously
unfiltered
with
a
medium
frothy
head
the
flavor
of
the
beer
is
not
overwhelming
notes
of
a
warhead
candy
are
delicately
balanced
with
floral
and
yeast
the
asian
flavor
comes
out
with
some
bitter
orange
and
eastern
spices
to
create
a
unique
profile
on
the
palate
although
the
forward
taste
passes
quickly
the
aftertaste
is
creamy
and
refreshing
this
is
a
good
beer
to
introduce
to
a
woman
who
doesnt
like
beer
because
the
flavor
is
mild
with
hints
of
sweetness
and
sour
like
a
lemon
drop
a
few
days
ago
i
tried
this
beer
again
and
paired
it
with
spicy
bbq
tritip
and
pork
which
totally
worked
because
the
refreshing
characteristics
really
cut
through
the
spicyfatty
meat
it
was
a
summer
hit
with
fairly
tough
beer
critics
crisp
light
refreshing
and
almost
too
easy
to
drink
i
actually
let
it
come
to
room
temp
as
well
to
test
its
drinkability
and
was
happy
to
find
it
still
tasted
pretty
darn
good
at
67
degrees
poured
a
pale
hay
yellow
with
a
scant
and
short
lived
white
head
mildly
hazy
as
it
should
be
although
the
aroma
smells
decent
like
lemonade
mixed
with
orange
juice
some
coriander
and
wheaty
funk
the
taste
is
an
epic
fail
ive
never
tasted
a
witbier
like
this
and
its
like
a
spritzy
lemony
sports
drink
nothing
like
a
witbier
that
im
looking
for
perhaps
im
looking
for
the
wrong
witbier
but
this
did
absolutely
nothing
for
me
d
definitely
a
fullbodied
wheat
ale
leaning
towards
a
wild
ale
sticks
out
in
flavor
from
the
bunch
of
witbiers
ive
tried
and
im
glad
i
got
a
new
perspective
on
the
style
from
this
beer
d
very
well
done
wit
very
unique
and
a
great
change
from
most
runofthemill
witbiers
great
for
sipping
on
a
hot
day
d
a
very
good
witbier
the
price
5
precludes
me
from
buying
this
often
but
its
a
real
nice
ale
d
very
consumable
especially
in
the
right
environment
the
drinkability
score
was
brought
down
once
i
experienced
slight
flavor
fatigue
pours
a
very
murky
straw
color
with
a
cap
of
white
foam
that
disapears
immediately
leaving
little
to
no
head
and
lacing
smell
is
wonder
floral
yeasty
biscuty
bready
lemony
vinous
apple
sweet
tart
acidic
all
in
one
the
aggressive
scent
does
not
signify
the
most
aggressive
taste
all
the
components
from
the
scnet
are
there
but
a
tad
more
muddled
the
tart
acidic
and
sweet
notes
a
bit
more
present
in
the
taste
as
well
as
the
biscuityness
medium
bodied
slightly
oily
feeling
and
dry
finnish
a
unique
beer
at
the
top
of
the
witbier
foodchain
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
with
a
medium
finish
the
beer
has
a
very
bright
crisp
clean
flavor
it
is
one
of
the
better
white
ales
that
i
have
tried
in
awhile
thank
you
dim
for
getting
me
this
beer
4
89
for
11
2
oz
is
fucking
expensive
but
if
youve
ever
chiefed
the
good
pots
youd
know
that
you
get
what
you
pay
for
at
least
in
most
cases
a
fantastic
example
of
a
wit
that
can
hold
its
own
with
the
belgians
and
allagash
white
this
is
also
the
first
craft
japanese
beer
i
have
experienced
and
lets
just
say
ill
be
back
for
more
offering
does
have
some
very
admirable
charecteristics
enjoyed
more
as
the
drink
progressed
however
not
a
desirable
offering
to
have
agian
over
all
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
lover
of
beer
regardless
of
preference
of
style
pours
a
vibrant
but
cloudy
orangeyellow
with
a
light
fizzy
white
head
that
mostly
remains
throughout
the
drink
aroma
is
cloves
lemon
rose
and
some
other
fragrant
spices
the
flavor
is
lemon
straight
up
with
spices
in
the
aftertaste
its
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
ends
up
a
bit
prickly
and
semidry
i
dont
have
too
much
experience
with
wits
as
i
usually
dont
like
them
and
end
up
being
a
bit
bland
that
was
not
the
case
here
this
had
lots
of
flavor
mostly
lemon
and
somewhat
tart
and
it
was
extremely
aromatic
if
it
were
cheaper
id
probably
purchase
this
on
a
regular
basis
d
i
could
drink
this
one
again
but
it
wouldnt
be
something
id
search
out
i
think
the
sourfunky
citrus
thing
is
about
the
only
thing
from
really
liking
this
one
value
pricey
but
you
get
what
you
pay
for
im
hardpressed
to
think
of
a
witbier
ive
enjoyed
this
much
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
the
drinkability
was
good
d
light
summer
beer
that
goes
down
relatively
easy
the
tart
lemony
flavor
is
a
bit
strong
and
might
prevent
me
from
having
more
than
one
of
these
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
into
tulip
glass
smell
of
citrus
is
definite
taste
of
grapefruit
and
orange
on
first
sip
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
belgian
beer
flavor
drinkability
is
very
good
good
backend
and
a
refreshing
taste
a
very
good
witbier
that
i
could
drink
a
few
more
of
definitely
very
good
since
i
got
the
first
pour
from
the
fresh
tap
d
extremely
drinkable
beer
with
a
very
refreshing
flavor
this
beer
is
flavorful
but
subtle
the
previous
time
i
had
this
beer
with
some
japanese
food
i
remember
enjoying
it
more
d
very
much
so
i
enjoyed
two
myself
cant
wait
to
drink
this
more
frequently
when
the
weather
warms
up
a
very
interesting
take
on
the
style
ugh
very
disappointing
i
hated
their
red
rice
and
dont
think
highly
of
this
one
i
probably
spared
the
lady
friend
from
a
lousy
experience
didnt
seem
to
be
a
bad
bottle
just
not
my
style
no
thanks
ill
just
grab
a
blue
moon
next
time
ouch
i
do
however
love
their
bottles
wow
i
will
say
it
again
the
flavor
is
vibrant
juicy
and
unique
like
boozy
sunshine
in
a
bottle
d
a
very
nice
sessionable
witbier
would
drink
again
without
hesitation
d
could
certainly
knock
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
warm
sunny
day
especially
along
with
some
spicy
food
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
found
it
to
be
very
quaffable
i
think
it
would
be
great
for
a
nice
summer
day
on
the
patio
or
while
working
the
grill
ill
definitely
seek
this
one
out
again
the
instant
smell
of
lemon
and
coriander
overwhelm
you
instantly
a
solid
1
finger
head
fills
my
pint
glass
a
japanese
wheat
beer
is
quite
the
conundrum
but
very
surprising
it
has
a
light
yellow
hazy
appearance
the
lemon
draw
is
sharp
as
you
swallow
but
very
pleasant
an
extremely
tasty
brew
this
brew
pours
a
pale
straw
hue
with
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
two
finger
bubbly
head
and
nice
lacing
all
around
the
glasswow
what
an
aroma
its
full
on
citrusorange
peellemon
zest
and
the
feintest
bit
of
corriander
which
i
rather
like
and
to
be
honest
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
niceststrongest
smelling
witbiers
ive
smelt
really
invitingit
has
a
nice
easy
mouthfeel
which
slides
down
with
tastes
of
citrusorange
peellemon
lime
bitters
and
lemon
barleyi
dont
usually
give
too
many
5s
for
any
beer
but
i
only
bought
one
of
these
brews
and
as
soon
as
i
finished
it
i
wanted
another
one
so
bad
its
not
funnyoverall
a
really
tasty
brew
that
will
buy
more
of
poured
from
a
750
ml
bottle
this
one
was
a
real
treat
almost
better
than
a
european
a
thick
yellow
translucent
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
coats
rather
well
smells
of
citrus
and
orange
peel
fill
the
nose
followed
with
a
touch
of
coriander
sweet
taste
in
the
beginning
going
down
to
a
slight
spiciness
excellent
poured
a
rich
yellow
haze
with
a
spectacular
head
smell
is
a
deep
mix
of
subtle
lemon
and
wheat
consistency
is
truly
inspirational
the
carbonation
literally
hangs
in
the
glass
creating
a
suspended
cloud
of
headyness
if
you
like
white
ale
and
its
my
favorite
this
is
a
homerun
has
a
tasty
lemon
flavor
with
a
distant
accent
of
slight
tartness
the
combination
of
the
two
gives
it
a
truly
unique
appeal
ill
give
it
japan
here
this
is

ok
drinkability
overall
the
mix
of
spices
and
malts
gave
it
a
bit
too
much
of
a
floral
taste
almost
like
potpourri
definitely
an
easy
wonderfully
drinkable
it
is
extremly
light
and
delicate
no

flavor
dominates
another
all
work
in
very
nice
harmony
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
about
a
good
japanese
beer
after
kirin
and
is
a
good
twist
on
the
style
imo
carbonation
is
pretty
strong
and
does
stand
out
with
what
is
a
very

beer

oh
great
summer
beer
my
favorite
offering
from
leinenkugels
this
is
a
great
brew
it
smells
and
tastes
very
similar
to
fruity
pebbles
which
may
sound
strange
but
it
is
very
good
this
is
one
of
only
two
wheat
ales
ive
had
the
other
being
blue
moon
and
i
vastly
prefer
this
one
what
a
gem
of
a
beer
great
taste
and
amazing
aroma
very
nostalgic
beer
for
me
for
me
its
horrible
no
way
one
of
my
secret
beers
i
have
always
loved
they
got
the
blueberry
smell
and
tase
just
right
like
fruity
pebbles
cereal
blueberry
taste
was
really
enjoyable
really
underrated
beer
this
is
brewed
by
a
small
familyowned
and
operated
brewery
in
wisconsin
they
are
very
creative
and
have
several
varieties
of
which
as
stated
before
this
is
my
fav
it
pours
out
a
very
light
golden
color
not
very
cloudy
with
a
hint
of
citrus
in
its
smell
its
got
a
soft
fruity
taste
its
not
too
heavy
so
you
can
drink
it
while
youre
grilling
some
carne
asada
on
the
deck
but
its
also
good
to
curl
up
with
while
youre
listening
to
some
blues
smooth
and
pretty
good
stuff
ill
have
another
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
i
just
wanted
to
pick
up
a
random
cheap
6pack
and
this
beer
seemed
like
it
might
be
good
but
it
was
really
an
interesting
brew
with
the
strong
blueberry
flavor
its
main
strength
is
also
its
main
weakness
though
i
wish
the
blueberry
was
a
little
more
subtle
still
a
good
choice
and
i
could
see
myself
picking
up
a
6pack
again
maybe
next
summer
i
am
so
in
love
with
this
beer
its
light
and
has
a
blueberry
hint
outlier
detected
please
enter
a
review
i
think
all
of
leinenkugels
beers
are
the
same
fruity
and
delicious
but
leave
you
wishing
they
had
something
more
distinguishing
than
which
fruit
is
in
this
particular
beer
youre
drinking
at
that
moment
thanksgiving
day
beer
tasting
at
bros
house
wonderful
unique
caramelized
taste

for
as
cheap
as
it
is
its
an
easy
drinking
wheat
beer
it
scratches
the
surface
of
the
witbier
style
but
cant
quite
compete
with
the
likes
of
hoegaarden
or
weihenstephaner
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
yes
by
the
six
pack
its
easy
drinking
and
very
sessionable

with
a

of

is
seen
that
slips
back
down
the
sides
of
the

except
a

small
areas
that

the
aroma
is
of

and
some

the
taste
starts
out

with
a
slight

doesnt

to
be

oi
finally
found
a

product
that
i
might
buy
again
i
havent
quite
finished
it
yet
but
will
enjoy
this
one
all
and
all
another
great
beer
from
a
terrific
brewery
heres
to
officially
earning
it
o
ive
nothing
overly
negative
to
say
about
sunset
wheat
not
only
did
it
serve
as
a
bridge
into
the
craft
world
for
me
but
its
actually
not
bad
artificial
tasting
and
slightly
gimmicky
you
could
definitely
say
that
offputting
not
quite
my
family
is
quite
the
fan
of
leinenkugels
offerings
as
well
as
some
beers
i
shant
name
and
i
can
always
find
refuge
in
sunset
wheat
when
the
beers
start
flowing
at
family
bbqs
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
and
see
if
it
does
better
i
may
have
just
had
the
wrong
beer
in
the
wrong
place
overall
a
great
beer
to
my
taste
i
really
like
fruit
beer
and
this
one
definitely
does
not
disappoint
in
that
respect
overall
in
my
opinion
this
is
what
blue
moon
should
be
an
almost
perfect
balance
of
wheat
oranges
and
spices
blue
moon
is
strong
on
the
coriander
this
is
a
nice
witbier
one
of
my
favorite
from
leinies
i
will
buy
it
over
blue
moon
anyday
but
witbiers
arent
my
favorite
style
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
serves
a
purpose
its
a
great
fruity
beer
for
summer
time
i
would
never
drink
it
otherwise
but
it
makes
a
perfect
campfire
beer
love
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
all
of
leinenkugels
seasonals
though
when
smelling
and
tasting
the
sunset
wheat
it
resembles
fruit
loops
in
my
opinion
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
in
a
short
period
of
time
and
i
have
definitely
give
this
a
try
if
you
like
fruity
tasting
beers
i
used
to
love
the
taste
but
now
all
i
can
taste
is
fruity
pebbles
and
it
bothers
me
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
color
with
little
head
or
lacing
the
nose
is
artificial
blueberry
and
belgian
yeast
think
a
blueberry
eggo
with
some
yeasty
bread
dough
on
top
the
flavor
is
bready
with
lots
of
bitter
not
fresh
blueberries
not
what
i
expected
when
i
grabbed
thus
and
not
something
id
come
back
to
i
do
not
like
hoppy
beers
and
since
wheat
beers
are
supposedly
one
of
the
least
hoppy
styles
i
decided
to
try
a
six
pack
of
this
brew
i
am
not
disappointed
sunset
wheat
pours
a
cloudy
orange
color
mine
had
about
a
halffinger
of
head
that
faded
quickly
leaving
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
only
soso
but
the
taste
is
fine
with
citrus
notes
right
up
front
and
a
kind
of
sharp
quality
to
it
the
mouth
feel
is
lightly
carbonated
true
to
the
style
there
is
only
a
slight
bitterness
to
the
finish
overall
i
find
it
to
be
a
refreshing
brew
and
probably
a
good
session
beer
though
for
me
a
session
is
usually
one
ipa
lovers
will
probably
hate
it
but
for
those
of
us
who
are
not
fans
of
high
ibus
this
one
will
do
the
job
tastethis
beer
i
can
honestly
say
tastes
almost
exactly
like
fruity
pebbles
the
cereal
it
has
a
sort
of
synthetic
fruit
taste
that
isnt
very
fresh
finish
is
a
bit
sour
and
leaves
a
weird
taste
on
the
tongue
overall
it
tastes
like
cereal
mixed
with
grain
pretty
different
this
was
left
with
me
after
a
party
two
days
ago
it
is
very
much
a
perfumey
girlie
beer

light
tasting
wheat
beer
not
really
sold
on
this
beer
being
worth
recommending
i
have
drank
this
beer
a
lot
it
is
archived
as
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
my
reference
is
to
fruity
pebbles
when
you
drink
this
beer
its
like
dessert
yet
not
too
sweet
surprisingly
light
and
fruity
you
can
tell
its
a
wheat
beer
just
by
the
appearance
and
taste
this
beer
pairs
well
with
just
about
everything
even
chocolate
its
too
bad
they
dont
make
scratch
and
sniff
stickers
for
this
beer
because
i
would
buy
them
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
if
you
like
wheat
beer
to
buy
and
drink
a
six
pack
in
one
sitting
not
a
disappointment
may
your
beer
be
cold
and
your
women
hot
for
a
relatively
affordable
beer
that
you
can
find
almost
anywhere
this
beer
was
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
summer
its
similar
to
something
like
blue
moon
slightly
citrusy
bubbly
and
delicious
perfect
for
poolside
fun
ive
never
had
a
friend
say
anything
negative
about
the
brew
works
well
for
picky
beer
drinkers
o
im
not
a
fan
because
it
is
so
sweet
it
goes
down
good
enough
though
but
i
dont
want
another
however
the
girls
here
seemed
to
gravitate
towards
this
one
my
friend
said
that
she
doesnt
like
beer
generally
but
likes
this
one
go
figure
i
could
easily
enjoy
multiples
of
this
witbier
in
one
sitting
incredibly
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
trying
overall
an
alright
brew
overall
nothing
super
out
of
the
ordinary
but
nothing
wrong
with
it
either
i
had
this
in
a
tasting
session
and
comparedcontrasted
it
with
hoegaarden
which
also
has
coriander
in
it
the
sunset
wheat
isnt
tempered
with
orange
peel
however
and
i
think
this
is
what
leads
to
the
anise
overtones
i
enjoyed
it
i
have
fond
memories
of
leinies
in
the
returnable
longnecks
i
wish
breweries
would
bring
back
this
custom
nowadays
i
really
like
the
amber
lager
if
available
and
would
really
like
to
try
the
creamy
dark
but
they
really
miss
with
this
one
maybe
if
they
get
enough
of
this
crap
sent
back
theyll
replace
it
with
something
decent
overall
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
i
picked
it
up
in
a
mixsix
but
would
definitely
grab
a
full
six
next
time
its
light
and
fun
and
with
the
lower
abv
i
could
knock
a
few
back
in
midday
after
some
yard
work
always
a
plus
overall
i
would
pick
up
a
blue
moon
any
day
before
this
beer
this
is
an
average
beer
on
hot
summer
day
at
best
drinkability
good
to
drink
with
a
fruit
salad
or
for
breakfast
lol
this
beer
seems
to
kill
it
with
the
ladies
during
the
springsummer
time
it
is
another
one
of
leinenkugels
extract
style
fruity
beers
it
like
the
others
tastes
sodalike
but
this
one
especially
tastes
like
fruity
pebbles
of
all
things
it
sounds
odd
but
it
really
does
this
beer
will
always
do
well
in
the
spring
and
especially
with
the
ladies
with
a
sweet
tooth
for
beer
o
overall
i
was
not
a
fan
of
the
beer
i
thought
that
it
really
didnt
taste
like
a
witbier
and
seriously
was
a
lot
like
drinking
fruity
pebbles
i
would
have
liked
to
taste
more
of
the
beer
and
less
of
the
fruit
flavoring
its
worth
trying
if
you
really
like
fruit
beers
but
i
dont
think
its
a
beer
that
would
draw
a
person
back
this
one
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
because
it
was
the
first
craft
beer
albeit
possible
faux
craft
but
thats
beside
the
point
i
ever
had
and
it
was
long
before
my
actual
endeavor
into
craft
beers
my
friends
and
i
used
to
go
to
the
store
and
pick
up
a
few
six
packs
of
sunset
wheat
and
play
video
games
all
night
those
were
the
days
upon
revisiting
im
definitely
not
nearly
as
infatuated
with
this
brew
as
i
once
was
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
still
remains
sessionable
and
nice
for
a
summertime
cooldown
overall
this
is
a
lager
with
blueberry
flavor
pretty
average
for
a
lager
with
moderate
artificial
flavor
avoid
unless
you
cant
handle
the
flavor
of
a
real
beer
or
if
you
simply
love
blueberries
i
will
say
i
dont
normally
enjoy
wheat
beers
but
this
one
isnt
that
bad
and
i
will
definitly
try
again
and
may
even
shop
for
it
its
good
not
great
in
my
opinion
if
you
like
wheats
try
it
if
you
dont
it
may
be
different
enough
that
you
still
may
want
to
try
overall
impression
loved
the
blueberry
aromataste
it
was
stronger
in
the
scent
than
in
the
flavor
excellent
when
cold
okay
when
starting
to
get
warm
its
sort
of
a
melon
thick
soda
than
a
witbier
not
feeling
the
love
on
this
one
this
beer
pours
a
very
hazy
straw
color
with
an
enormous
head
and
substantial
lacing
the
smell
is
floral
lemons
and
oranges
mouthfeel
is
about
overdone
with
carbonation
if
they
could
dial
that
back
a
little
it
would
be
much
more
pleasing
taste
is
a
fruitiness
upfront
that
seamlessly
gives
way
to
a
spicy
mild
bitterness
on
the
finish
a
very
average
beer
but
very
drinkable
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
hazed
opaque
slightly
pale
yellowgold
coloring
with
a
thin
white
coating
of
head
aromas
of
fruitcake
with
a
lemony
highlight
and
a
slight
roasting
flavors
are
sharp
with
an
effervescence
that
almost
obliterates
the
flavors
the
fruit
sweetness
is
shortlived
and
there
is
a
tangy
floral
end
flavor
that
really
sours
the
palate
the
aftertaste
is
watered
down
with
a
touch
of
floral
dashed
in
there
bleh
its
turning
into
a
bit
of
a
mess
now
filmy
cloying
finish
not
good
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
foamy
beige
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
fake
citrus
aromas
and
a
perfumelike
note
taste
is
much
the
same
with
an
artificial
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
that
is
not
really
all
that
beerlike
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
decent
summery
beer
more
like
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
than
a
witbier
in
some
regards
it
has
a
distinct
wheat
flavor
but
is
also
light
and
mildy
spicy
its
a
suitable
summer
session
beer
for
anyone
those
who
arent
particularly
adventurous
with
beer
but
do
like
a
blue
moon
from
time
to
time
would
probably
enjoy
this
for
me
its
a
little
too
indistinct
to
be
a
regular
summer
choice
currently
my
favorite
beer
about
a
year
ago
i
went
to
buffalo
wild
wings
where
i
was
introduced
to
this
it
instead
of
ordering
my
usual
glass
of
hefe
i
asked
the
bartender
to
give
me
something
different
he
gave
me
this
and
immediately
i
tasted
fruity
pebbles
cereal
and
fell
in
love
needless
to
say
i
was
feeling
so
good
when
it
was
time
to
leave
i
forgot
to
ask
what
the
name
of
the
beer
was
after
a
few
more
attempts
and
the
same
results
i
finally
asked
the
name
before
i
asked
for
the
fruity
pebbles
beer
they
told
me
and
ive
been
buying
it
ever
since
i
love
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
pretty
nice
onefinger
fizzy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
yeast
notes
lemon
and
some
nice
fruityness
the
taste
is
malty
yeast
fruity
with
some
citrus
notes
medium
body
a
nice
brew
for
a
hot
day
the
body
of
the
beer
is
fizzy
and
light
but
seems
to
have
few
flavors
native
to
the
fundamental
brewing
process
almost
all
of
the
flavorings
seem
imported
after
the
fact
and
these
seem
oily
and
aromatic
and
thus
made
this
beer
taste
like
furniture
polish
or
something
even
more
industrial
the
top
notes
are
falsely
fruity
but
below
that
are
the
more
citrusy
lemon
pledge
sorts
of
effects
with
other
odd
chemical
notes
this
beer
in
its
thinness
and
weird
artificial
tang
bears
no
resemblance
to
a
typical
weizen
i
tried
to
get
used
to
it
with
a
gamey
sense
of
experiment
but
the
sense
that
i
was
drinking
unpleasant
chemicals
in
the
name
of
beer
actually
got
more
offensive
as
i
persisted
o
great
for
a
summer
afternoon
while
it
may
not
be
outstanding
it
is
still
very
good
overall
not
my
cup
of
tea
artificial
fruit
flavor
mixed
with
a
thin
beer
ended
with
a
drain
pour
12oz
bottle
out
of
a
summer
sampler
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
trace
orange
hues
foamy
white
head
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
sweet
and
odd
hinting
wheat
orange
tang
cherry
and
blueberry
tastes
are
complex
but
are
also
odd
especially
for
the
style
fruity
yeast
reminiscent
of
a
canned
fruit
cup
orange
zest
lemon
grass
wheat
blueberry
and
maybe
a
hint
of
agave
not
much
for
spiciness
as
you
would
expect
for
the
style
mouthfeel
is
thin
for
a
wheat
ale
but
not
terribly
thin
plenty
of
carbonation
and
finishes
on
the
palate
tangy
and
tingly
overall
this
was
weird
for
me
blueberry
orange
tang
fruit
cup
it
kept
me
thinking
about
it
as
i
drank
it
but
thats
about
it
i
guess
id
take
it
over
a
macrolager
but
its
not
much
better
than
that
originally
reviewed
01122012
overall
def
try
nothing
wrong
with
the
appearance
its
a
bit
hazy
with
a
smallish
head
smell
is
sharply
sugary
watermelon
jolly
ranchers
comes
to
mind
taste
isnt
nearly
as
sugary
as
the
smell
but
nonetheless
its
sweet
sort
of
like
offbrand
strawberry
or
raspberry
flavored
jelly
beans
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
okay
this
one
is
not
for
me
i
must
agree
with
a
previous
poster
as
soon
as
you
taste
this
beer
you
think
fruity
pebbles
pretty
good
beer
although
surprisingly
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
what
you
would
imagine
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
liking
i
believe
that
drinking
enough
of
these
would
make
me
feel
sick
to
my
stomach
although
a
great
beer
to
get
if
youre
throwing
a
party
and
inviting
a
couple
of
girls
who
wont
drink
most
beer
o
some
might
turn
their
nose
at
the
blueberry
addition
and
fruit
character
but
when
im
in
the
mood
for
this
beer
it
really
hits
the
spot
great
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
doa
i
dont
know
what
people
are
saying
but
this
beer
is
delicious
its
like
juice
and
beer
in
a
bottle
i
love
its
fruity
aroma
mixed
with
a
unique
beer
taste
when
i
tried
this
stuff
at
a
party
the
flavor
took
me
by
suprise
maybe
i
am
just
used
to
crappy
beers
or
something
and
the
others
can
afford
pricey
ones
i
would
say
this
is
one
of
my
most
favorite
beers
i
found
the
wheat
secondary
or
tertiary
to
this
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
a
light
body
not
a
beer
i
will
try
again
as
it
was
much
to
fake
and
sugary
tasting
like
a
low
grade
malt
bevereage
until
the
aftertaste
this
a
straight
up
wheat
aftertaste
has
a
sugary
artificial
aspect
that
is
a
bit
offputting
it
aint
bad
but
it
aint
great
drink
it
if
someone
else
is
buying
rjt
o
certainly
a
different
take
with
the
lager
yeast
not
too
sure
about
how
i
actually
feel
about
it
though
also
not
too
sure
about
how
i
feel
with
the
blueberrycitrus
combo
decent
beer
though
definitely
on
the
girly
side
good
witbier
overall
a
very
sweet
fruity
wheat
beer
screw
the
light

they

this

by
adding
just
a

more
of

can

drinking
this

fruitiness
to
enjoy
beer
or
on
a
really
hot
summers
evening
it
could
also
go
well
with
selected
foods

something
with
lemon
in
it
to
help
reduce
the
abrasiveness
of
the
scent
great
anytime
beer
has
a
faint

taste
and
of

a
hint
of
blueberry
flavor
most
of
my
female
friends
really
enjoy
this
beer
although
one
of
my
girlfriends
claims
it
tastes
like
fruity
pebbles
i
have
a
deep
love
for
witbier
and
this
is
a
tasty
almost
with
too
much
candy
sweetness
this
is
definitely
an
experience
beer
although
it
was
a
little
over
the
top
as
far
as
citrus
went
still
very
refreshing
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
lemons
and
oranges
and
maybe
a
lime
or
two
it
has
a
medium
golden
hazy
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
foamy
thick
head
that
lingers
for
a
while
along
with
some
mild
lacing
its
smooth
but
has
a
strong
bitter
orange
peel
flavor
through
out
and
is
a
little
dry
with
not
much
body
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
difficult
to
figure
out
but
it
certainly
goes
with
the
flavor
of
the
beer
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
just

isnt
too

by

herbs
there
is
only
a

hops

the
beer
is

d
very
quaffable
and
nicely
spiced
not
the

it
lacks
some
of
the

worth
trying
an
interesting
choice
w
the

it
does
seem
cleaner
in

impressive
for
a
micro
shipped
from
wisconsin
to
new
hampshire
d
yuck
i
passed
this
beer
to
a
friend
that
likes
fruity
things
d
overall
im
glad
i
gave
this
beer
another
shot
as
i
didnt
like
it
when
it
first
came
out
now
id
say
its
worth
a
try
feels
really
good
in
the
mouthi
would
drink
this
beer
again
but
is
hard
to
find
drinkabilitywonderful
beer
easy
to
fall
in
love
with
this
is
a
decent
summer
session
brew
if
you
like
fruity
citrus
brews
pours
a
cludy
burnt
yellow
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissapates
very
fruity
smell
with
an
overubundance
of
citrus
this
is
fruity
beer
so
if
you
arent
a
fruity
beer
kind
of
person
this
one
isnt
for
you
very
smooth
taste
of
orange
peels
transitioning
to
mild
peach
almost
no
hint
of
hops
whatsoever
this
is
an
excellent
beer
on
hot
days
when
the
masses
are
drinking
their
bud
light
and
miller
lite
a
good
drinkability
that
has
its
place
at
the
beach
or
on
hot
days
d
pretty
good
at
first
when
its
cold
its
light
in
body
and
that
fruity
sweetness
hasnt
settled
in
yet
but
i
slow
down
near
the
end
of
the
second
glass
due
to
the
sweetness
i
really
liked
this
one
it
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
and
the
aroma
was
fruity
very
smooth
pleasant
taste
that
was
citrusy
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
on
the
south
mississippi
gulf
coast
where
the
high
yesterday
was
98
had
this
one
again
and
i
definitely
tasted
the
fruity
pebbles
that
others
have
described
drinkability
would
be
ok
cause
its
not
that
strong
but
the
flavors
arent
either
sorry
but
this
beer
is
bad
but
interesting
this
is
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
and
thats
where
its
wheat
characteristics
end
it
smells
like
candy
fruit
and
tastes
like
bubble
gum
i
can
detect
the
orange
coriander
lemon
rind
and
other
citrus
but
this
just
has
imitation
written
all
over
it
it
doesnt
taste
real
but
rather
like
extract
was
added
to
it
thus
giving
it
its
artificial
bubble
gum
flavor
its
a
light
bodied
decently
carbonated
beer
its
light
with
a
small
mouthfeel
and
no
real
after
taste
ive
had
a
few
sips
and
thats
all
for
me
drinkability
this
is
a
great
summertime
beer
i
loved
the
citrus
taste
that
it
had
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
friends
hmm
a
bit
much
berry
flavor
here
but
i
do
like
it
i
think
after
about
three
of
these
i
would
want
something
else
aroma
is
malty
with
a
wheaty
undertone
and
hints
of
orange
color
is
warmly
golden
and
somewhat
cloudy
flavor
is
rich
rather
malty
with
strong
orange
tone
rather
sweet
but
not
cloying
just
a
whisper
of
smokiness
it
has
a
nice
thick
feel
that
i
do
not
often
find
in
wheat
beers
and
leaves
a
pleasant
and
satisfying
aftertaste
better
than
what
i
expected
pours
out
a
really
murky
peach
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
once
receded
leaves
some
drippy
lacing
smells
of
a
wheat
graininess
with
some
blueberry
lemonheads
and
fruity
pebbles
has
an
artificial
smell
to
it
more
beer
characteristics
come
out
in
the
flavor
with
some
pale
malts
and
wheat
but
then
gets
pushed
out
by
berry
and
fruity
pebbles
weird
but
not
really
bad
mouthfeel
is
light
but
a
little
gritty
from
the
yeast
and
the
carbonation
is
tingly
and
doesnt
prick
too
hard
this
is
a
bit
weird
for
me
to
crave
another
good
alternative
to
a
soda
most
definitely
d
definitely
a
nice
summer
time
warm
weather
drink
enjoyed
a
couple
at
a
friends
on
the
4th
fit
the
mood
nicely
would
drink
again
if
someone
offered
to
me
but
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
the
way
to
stock
at
my
house
this
is
the
type
of
beer
that
a
macro
drinker
would
drink
and
say
they
are
branching
out
to
something
more
bold
but
it
isnt
pours
a
hazy
dark
yellow
smelly
quite
floral
and
perfumy
tastes
a
little
les
floral
than
the
smell
a
bit
like
citrus
but
without
much
bite
average
mouthfeel
overall
its
a
good
summer
beer
but
beyond
that
quite
average
i
would
drink
it
again
if
offered
overall
though
its
a
big
so
what
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
was
a
pale
yellow
color
and
very
cloudy
the
head
was
white
and
had
decent
retention
the
aroma
was
full
of
citrus
with
some
spices
the
taste
was
lemony
with
some
spices
towards
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
with
a
mediumlight
body
and
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
a
decent
beer
but
not
one
i
will
purchase
again
what
an
interesting
beer
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
tight
white
head
its
aroma
distinguishes
this
beer
not
sure
if
it
is
artificial
or
not
but
i
detect
lemon
orange
and
a
little
bit
of
blueberry
the
taste
goes
along
with
the
aroma
there
is
some
sourness
that
suggest
the
citrus
part
of
the
beer
is
natural
it
is
quite
a
refreshing
summer
beer
it
is
very
drinkable
however
the
aftertaste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
there
is
a
hollowness
followed
by
a
metallic
flavor
not
sure
why
that
happens
but
maybe
they
need
to
add
some
more
bittering
hops
to
balance
it
out
better
overall
worth
trying
but
i
suppose
some
will
either
really
like
or
really
dislike
this
one
mouthfeel
is
crisp
body
is
okay
but
a
little
thin
even
for
a
wheat
interesting
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavors
going
on
perhaps
not
a
personal
favorite
but
a
good
summer
choice
the
feel
is
creamy
and
nice
none
of
the
chewy
orange
juice
feel
of
a
hef
but
all
the
fruity
flavor
its
a
unique
beer
like
a
smooth
creamy
hefeweizen
has
the
taste
of
a
hef
and
the
feel
of
a
witbier
very
solid
selection
my
last
ill
make
this
short
and
sweet
pun
intented
an
orange
soda
pop
malt
beverage
with
natural
fruit
flavors
concoction
something
about
the
idea
of
a
hefe
style
beer
with
a
light
citrusy
note
and
perhaps
that
characteristic
bubble
gum
scent
caused
me
to
buy
this
boy
was
i
ever
dissapointed
my
girlfriend
didnt
like
it
shes
the
kind
thatll
put
a
lemon
slice
in
a
good
hefe
the
sunset
wheat
poured
a
hazy
yellow
some
carbonation
drifted
up
to
a
scant
white
cap
nominal
lacing
smell
is
sweet
lemon
and
grains
taste
is
more
sweet
citrus
over
a
nice
malt
hop
blend
maybe
some
pepper
as
well
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
very
refreshing
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
when
its
real
hot
and
sticky
d
im
glad
i
only
have
one
of
this
and
i
may
not
even
finish
this
one
my
girl
who
likes
fruity
beers
would
probably
like
this
definitely
not
for
me
though
this
wasnt
very
drinkable
in
spite
of
being
a
lightweight
because
the
orange
got
to
be
way
to
much
i
also
disagree
with
it
being
a
witbier
although
i
didnt
notice
any
blueberry
either
so
go
figure
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
moderate
white
fizzy
head
that
faded
quickly
with
no
lace
smell
was
very
sweet
lots
of
lemon
and
wheat
hints
in
here
wow
the
taste
if
i
did
not
know
better
i
would
swear
there
was
a
lemon
in
the
bottle
smooth
and
light
but
really
sweet
i
would
not
have
put
soo
much
lemon
or
corriander
or
whatever
that
herb
is
thats
sweeting
it
other
than
that
a
very
sessionable
summer
beer
interesting
strange
i
think
the
jury
is
still
out
on
this
one
now
hear
me
out
in
accordance
with
the
intentions
of
the
site
i
always
try
to
be
very
constructive
with
my
reviews
this
case
is
no
different
with
that
being
said
this
beer
taste
exactly
like
post
fruity
pebbles
several
of
my
friends
at
the
establishment
we
were
patronizing
agreed
pure
unadulterated
fruity
pebbles
breakfast
cereal
there
may
have
been
something
weird
going
on
with
the
keg
or
there
may
be
some
sort
of
glitch
in
my
brain
but
grain
a
bit
of
wheat
and
sohelpmegod
fruity
pebbles
some
stale
socks
aftertaste
this
is
bad
a
pint
is
almost
too
much
wouldnt
have
two
not
sure
what
this
would
pair
with
either
wont
have
it
again
md
very
very
dry
my
mouth
is
still
dry
im
not
sure
why
maybe
it
was
just
me
way
too
try
for
me
and
this
style
decent
medium
to
light
body
and
relatively
drinkable
except
after
two
i
felt
like
my
mouth
was
cotton
a
frind
who
spent
last
summer
in
the
midwest
had
been
talking
about
this
so
i
had
to
pick
it
up
poors
a
hazy
straw
with
a
big
white
head
smells
pretty
fruity
with
some
wheat
mixed
in
for
good
measure
the
taste
also
sticks
with
the
fruit
and
wheat
theme
from
the
noze
and
finishes
very
crisp
and
clean
this
beer
was
exceptionaly
good
hanging
outside
with
some
friends
very
smooth
something
a
non
beer
drinker
would
appreciate
but
appreciated
by
me
as
well
i
did
not
like
it
at
all
too
much
coriander
the
citrus
flavoring
tasted
artificial
and
left
a
real
bad
aftertaste
reminded
me
of
generic
froot
loops
but
not
as
good
after
two
bottles
out
of
the
six
i
gave
up
even
attempting
to
see
if
the
3rd
time
was
a
charm
ill
usually
always
finish
a
six
no
matter
how
good
or
bad
it
is
not
in
this
case
i
did
not
like
it
pours
a
cloudy
dirty
gold
color
with
virtually
no
head
just
a
ring
around
the
beer
nothing
too
attractive
aromas
of
lemon
and
a
faint
blueberry
note
that
seems
a
bit
unnatural
to
me
maybe
it
actually
is
all
natural
i
dont
know
but
it
reminds
me
most
of
all
of
booberry
cereal
on
the
palate
this
is
way
too
sweet
with
a
sugary
cereal
fruitiness
with
only
the
barest
of
balancing
wheat
acidity
and
spiciness
the
sweetness
doesnt
taste
very
honeylike
it
tastes
refined
mouthfeel
is
coating
and
a
bit
cloying
not
fresh
and
lively
enough
for
the
style
overall
this
is
bad
way
too
sweet
no
freshness
to
balance
it
out
use
only
as
a
safety
beer
taken
ice
cold
and
from
the
bottle
directly
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
a
cross
between
the
sea
dog
fruit
beers
and
the
new
belgium
skinny
dip
its
fruity
but
with
lime
and
spice
mixed
in
drinkability
nice
summer
beer
didnt
know
this
was
a
witbier
till
i
bought
it
served
slightly
chilled
in
a
pint
glass
from
a
twelve
ounce
bottle
poured
a
hazy
golden
straw
like
color
about
one
good
finger
of
thick
pillowy
bright
white
head
formed
head
slowly
faded
into
a
thick
white
ring
around
the
glass
and
left
a
decent
amount
of
sticky
lace
smell
a
rather
strong
fruity
aroma
lots
of
citrus
orange
lemon
a
touch
of
blueberry
with
a
hint
of
wheat
mostly
hidden
by
all
of
the
fruit
the
taste
was
just
as
interesting
more
orange
lemon
zest
a
little
blueberry
with
a
lot
more
wheat
than
the
nose
had
suggested
mild
carbonation
quite
out
of
balance
the
fruit
tones
overwhelm
the
rest
of
the
flavors
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
but
very
refreshing
drinkability
is
pretty
good
cloudy
and
slightly
orangish
yellow
on
the
pour
the
reasonablysized
cap
of
foamy
offwhite
head
lingers
pretty
well
the
smell
is
pretty
straightforward
with
a
neutral
wheaty
base
complemented
by
a
bit
of
spice
and
some
sweet
citrus
its
that
citrus
that
dominates
the
taste
which
is
lemony
from
start
to
finish
the
underlying
grains
cant
hold
their
own
which
mutes
what
might
otherwise
be
some
interesting
complexity
the
mouthfeel
is
more
clingy
than
i
expect
in
this
style
which
is
perhaps
why
that
lemony
sweetness
lingers
for
so
long
goes
down
well
but
a
lack
of
balance
hurts
this
one
on
tap
poured
into
a
tall
weizen
glass
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
diminishes
big
citrus
orange
aromas
the
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
the
flavor
could
almost
be
described
as
o
j
mixed
with
a
very
light
pale
ale
very
light
very
refreshing
very
light
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
it
is
what
it
is
an
above
average
witbier
if
you
need
a
decent
beer
to
cool
off
after
a
long
sundrenched
day
this
will
do
the
trick
overall
its
a
tad
above
average
its
clearly
not
a
belgian
but
it
doesnt
proclaim
itself
as
one
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
better
wheat
choices
i
think
depending
on
how
much
you
want
to
spend
the
beer
is
a
bit
thin
but
for
the
style
thats
ok
and
it
allows
this
to
be
easily
drinkable
a
nice
warm
springsummer
drinker
overall
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
offering
it
would
be
the
perfect
accompaniment
to
seafood
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
just
had
to
alter
the
drinkability
score
on
this
but
ill
let
the
other
scores
stand
over
an
hour
after
drinking
this
beer
i
had
a
sort
of
medicinal
sweet
blueberry
taste
in
my
mouth
not
pleasant
and
not
leaving
me
with
the
desire
to
have
another
editi
didnt
realize
this
was
made
with
blueberries
i
guess
that
explains
things
but
it
is
still
gross
the
fruit
tastes
artificial
just
like
a
kids
breakfast
cereal
drinkability
i
certainly
wouldnt
have
picked
up
a
6pack
had
i
know
it
was
going
to
be
like
this
more
of
a
fruit
beer
than
a
hefe
or
wit
but
i
can
see
some
people
liking
this
especially
because
of
the
weather
reviewing
this
one
from
memory
earlier
today
asmtd
aside
theres
little
warning
to
indicate
what
this
beer
is
namely
a
blueberry
brew
when
i
picked
it
up
i
was
expecting
a
hefe
not
too
far
off
its
a
wit
but
a
very
very
very
blueberry
wit
an
earlier
reviewer
likened
it
to
fruity
pebbles
yes
it
is
that
sweet
it
tastes
like
blueberry
extract
that
being
said
its
not
all
that
bad
theres
enough
of
the
wheat
to
balance
in
the
aftertaste
to
make
this
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
blueberry
beers
this
is
a
better
than
average
example
of
the
style
unfortunately
if
youre
like
me
and
you
dont
like
them
be
warned
although
it
doesnt
explicitly
mention
it
on
the
label
this
is
one
blueberry
for
the
record
books
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
like
me
this
will
probably
be
one
of
the
blues
you
can
stomach
that
illgotten
six
pack
of
overall
well
its
definitely
different
ill
give
it
that
the
blueberries
were
a
little
too
much
for
me
but
i
still
found
it
enjoyable
this
would
definitely
taste
good
late
afternoon
on
a
hot
summer
day
worth
a
try
for
anyone
who
enjoys
beer
thats
out
of
the
ordinary
definitely
worth
it
if
you
enjoy
beer
with
fruit
flavors
basically
if
you
like
abitas
purple
haze
youll
probably
like
this
nice
beer
to
have
on
a
warm
day
not
sure
i
could
do
a
session
with
this
beer
i
might
have
to
be
sitting
in
the
direct
sun
to
pull
it
off
stays
very
close
to
style
it
is
available
year
round
according
to
the
website
i
see
myself
only
drinking
this
beer
in
the
hot
midwest
summers
notes
a
very
smooth
and
interesting
offering
after
two
of
these
babies
though
it
got
old
in
a
hurry
not
session
worthy
in
this
household
simply
because
it
feels
a
bit
infused
and
candied
flavors
start
to
get
annoying
but
for
one
and
done
its
above
average
at
least
d
probably
hard
to
drink
very
many
because
of
the
fizz
and
the
overly
sweet
berry
quality
i
like
the
hops
touch
though
it
has
a
cloudy
light
honey
color
and
a
sandy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
to
long
and
a
strong
citrus
smell
there
is
too
much
carbonation
it
drinks
better
than
you
would
expect
there
is
a
crisp
orange
taste
on
that
familiar
base
of
a
wheat
beer
it
is
best
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
d
i
still
dont
really
like
this
but
its
far
better
on
tap
than
in
bottles
drinkability
good
beer
for
the
beach
still
despite
all
that
i
found
myself
downing
two
fairly
easily
this
isnt
the
worst
wheat
beer
out
there
but
its
not
the
best
either
seems
like
its
becoming
more
readily
available
so
give
it
a
try
this
makes
a
good
session
beer
even
my
wife
liked
it
to
each
their
own
but
this
beer
wasnt
for
me
too
much
citrustoo
much
sweet
it
was
a
good
beer
had
a
few
since
it
was
the
special
i
would
give
this
a
solid
recommendation
for
someone
who
wants
a
light
summer
ale
interesting
hazy
orange
color
and
a
thin
head
that
seems
to
be
retaining
well
so
far
very
slight
hop
bitterness
overly
citrus
but
with
just
enough
wheat
character
very
refreshing
summer
brew
good
change
of
pace
from
the
darker
brews
i
will
probably
buy
another
sixer
of
this
one
soon
i
have
this
in
my
top
5
of
current
beers
to
drink
very
sweet
smell
in
the
bottle
poured
it
into
my
trusty
chalice
great
head
color
golden
and
opaque
head
has
staying
power
taste
is
very
different
sweet
like
honey
with
hints
of
black
licorice
very
creamy
mouthfeel
a
very
sweet
bitter
finish
laces
nicely
on
the
glass
jake
and
family
has
done
a
good
job
brewing
a
good
variety
of
beers
since
the
old
days
of
the
original
standby
leinies
overall
drinkability
of
this
good
if
you
can
get
over
the
shocking
abundance
of
fruit
flavor
notes
not
a
witbier
in
my
book
doesnt
have
the
spice
complexity
just
a
nice
uncomplicated
wheat
ale
and
a
solid
sessioner
on
a
hot
day
this
particular
beer
has
a
fruityness
the
likes
of
which
i
generally
associate
with
a
bin
of
brachs
it
reeks
of
marketing
obscuring
the
brewers
art
ill
yield
the
point
that
it
uses
blueberries
in
unusual
fashion
but
it
comes
off
like
artificial
berry
flavor
all
the
same
i
would
call
this
a
fruited
american
wheat
beer
not
a
witbier
by
a
long
shot
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
orangeyellow
with
a
thick
creamy
head
and
lacing
intense
blueberry
aroma
with
some
citrus
notes
big
blueberry
flavor
with
orange
and
bubble
gum
in
the
finish
i
had
heard
about
the
blueberry
flavor
but
didnt
believe
it
until
i
tried
it
nice
beer
but
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
taste
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
appeared
exactly
like
a
hefe
should
be
slightly
cloudy
color
was
a
nice
golden
hue
head
was
non
existent
but
there
was
a
little
lacing
that
clung
to
the
side
as
many
of
my
friends
have
described
it
smells
just
like
a
loopy
frooty
cereal
breathing
in
from
the
glass
gives
a
similar
taste
in
the
mouth
the
actual
taste
is
lacking
initially
there
is
a
blueberry
type
flavor
however
that
quickly
disappears
to
basically
nothing
with
wheat
undertones
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
but
was
a
little
thin
very
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
special
about
it
beyond
the
frooty
aroma
and
quick
flavor
as
a
big
fan
of
hefeweizenstyle
beer
i
truly
enjoyed
this
witbier
from
leinenkugel
the
aroma
is
highly
suggestive
of
fruit
and
as
expected
the
taste
reminds
one
of
a
fruitflavored
breakfast
cereal
the
head
of
this
beer
was
practically
nonexistent
but
the
overall
appearance
is
what
one
would
expect
of
a
hefeweizen
i
really
enjoy
drinking
this
beer
and
believe
it
to
be
highly
drinkable
especially
for
those
whose
taste
is
more
inclined
to
sweet
beers
would
make
an
exceptional
desert
beer
or
a
nice
complement
for
a
seafood
dinner
salmon
lobster
etc
im
a
big
leinenkugels
fan
that
being
said
i
ordered
this
beer
with
high
expectations
i
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
so
i
cant
comment
on
the
head
or
the
color
but
with
the
first
drink
the
only
thing
that
i
could
taste
was
fruity
pebbles
not
what
i
expected
i
bit
too
sweet
for
my
taste
dont
think
ill
be
ordering
this
beer
again
avoid
this
beer
get
some
hoegaarden
instean
they
had
this
on
tap
during
a
family
dinner
at
tgifridays
that
it
was
there
at
all
was
a
pleasant
surprise
and
drinking
it
was
a
breeze
at
least
on
its
own
but
i
have
to
tell
you
that
tendency
to
perfume
was
moderately
bothersome
not
only
that
the
floral
and
fruit
pieces
make
it
less
than
a
willing
accompaniment
to
most
strongly
flavored
meal
choices
in
fact
it
got
utterly
lost
against
my
cobb
salad
and
did
nothing
more
then
wet
my
whistle
still
were
i
to
find
myself
in
the
hot
sun
and
this
was
in
my
hand
id
be
fine
with
it
as
long
as
it
was
the
best
choice
at
least
not
terrible
but
i
got
tired
of
it
quickly
md
smooth
and
light
bodied
with
a
great
easy
downness
i
am
so
surprised
i
will
buy
this
more
and
more
and
more
not
just
as
a
ba
enjoying
and
respecting
a
great
beer
but
when
i
have
company
over
or
when
its
hot
out
and
im
sitting
on
the
porch
waiting
for
a
thunderstorm
to
roll
in
this
is
great
note
ive
found
this
in
bottle
form
and
it
does
have
more
carbonation
than
the
tap
version
drinkability
average
delicious
a
little
filling
i
cant
session
this
beer
but
it
was
a
wonderful
treat
very
enjoyable
d
much
better
flavor
than
blue
moon
but
it
takes
a
way
back
seat
ie
the
very
back
of
the
station
wagon
to
hoegaarden
this
is
a
nice
brew
for
a
summer
afternoona
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
ipas
da
take
it
easy
on
the
lemmonlime
wedge
effect
and
this
one
might
be
pretty
drinkable
overall
good
but
probably
wont
buy
again
id
spend
the
extra
to
get
that
cleaner
taste
edit
i
guess
if
i
had
read
the
ba
notes
i
would
have
known
it
was
friggin
blueberries
surprisingly
smooth
and
sweet
this
would
make
for
an
excellent
indoctrination
to
the
world
of
beer
for
nonbeer
drinkers
read
girls
but
is
still
more
than
enjoyable
for
more
seasoned
drinkers
decent
mouthfeel
minus
the
sticky
cloyingness
i
could
probably
polish
off
a
sixer
of
this
with
no
problem
perfect
summer
time
beer
as
are
most
wheaties
i
say
this
one
shall
be
in
my
fridge
again
in
the
future
d
not
a
every
day
drinker
but
a
nice
change
silly
rabbit
leinenkugels
is
for
kids
pours
a
nice
hazy
orange
quick
fading
head
smell
reminds
me
of
fresh
blueberry
puree
this
is
a
bit
too
sweet
to
have
more
than
one
like
drinking
the
milk
after
a
good
bowl
of
fruity
cereal
lingering
berry
aftertaste
enjoyable
and
fun
though
overall
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
my
wife
drinks
this
stuff
like
water
it
is
just
too
sweet
for
me
fruity
pebbles
was
the
correct
flavor
weve
checked
the
two
together
it
isnt
bad
for
a
summer
lawnmower
beer
but
it
could
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
some
d
has
a
good
drinkability
level
due
to
its
flavor
composition
and
watery
feel
would
do
well
for
a
cookout
being
the
first
truly
hotwarm
day
here
for
the
season
this
beer
is
a
good
way
to
kick
off
the
late
springsummer
months
but
may
not
hold
up
in
the
face
of
other
witbiers
decent
body
and
carbonation
this
isnt
bad
but
it
is
a
bit
too
sweet
and
the
fruit
flavors
dont
seem
natural
they
dont
seem
blended
in
rather
they
compete
with
the
base
of
the
beer
still
worth
a
shot
particularly
in
the
hot
weather
overall
i
have
to
say
this
is
in
my
top
five
for
best
witbiers
highly
enjoyable
and
very
sessionable
comments
honestly
i
didnt
mind
this
as
a
beverage
but
i
dont
think
i
could
consider
it
beer
per
se
tasty
fruity
flavorful
albeit
a
bit
fake
tasting
but
possesses
no
qualities
youd
expect
from
beer
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
to
be
honest
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
and
would
not
drink
it
again
however
if
you
like
blue
moon
youd
probably
like
this
beer
as
well
i
was
sad
to
see
that
this
beer
had
replaced
the
newport
storm
of
the
season
tap
at
the
abbey
and
mentioned
as
much
to
the
bartender
for
it
whatever
it
may
have
been
worth
quite
different
this
could
make
it
a
bit
challenging
but
worth
the
challenge
i
really
liked
this
one
apparently
more
than
pretty
much
everyone
else
pours
your
standard
foggy
light
yellow
witbier
color
lots
of
white
foam
on
top
smell
is
lots
of
orange
and
i
didnt
even
have
any
in
there
taste
is
almost
overwhelmingly
a
sweet
version
of
orange
peel
but
still
delicious
not
a
lot
else
going
on
but
its
strangely
tasty
feel
is
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
but
tasty
overall
a
solid
beer
with
a
really
unique
flavor
reminded
me
of
a
lambic
because
of
its
distinct
fruitiness
i
still
liked
it
a
very
unique
beer
drinks
alright
a
lot
to
fruitty
for
me
someone
probably
digs
this
ill
be
sexist
think
it
would
a
just
a
few
women
not
a
good
example
of
a
wit
by
far
this
could
be
the
ultimate
beer
for
back
porch
relaxing
or
enjoying
after
the
lawn
is
cut
this
was
my
first
beer
by
the
leinenkugel
family
but
i
will
now
be
on
the
lookout
for
any
more
styles
i
can
get
my
hands
on
not
one
i
will
buy
again
i
could
drink
this
like
water
on
a
hot
summer
day
no
doubt
i
bet
the
ladies
will
like
it
a
lot
more
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
sweet
tastes
its
easy
to
drink
but
i
dont
see
myself
putting
down
more
than
two
of
these
in
a
sitting
blueberry
overload
plus
the
cloying
affect
may
get
to
me
after
more
than
a
couple
ill
drink
one
and
then
move
along
to
my
hoppy
goodness
poured
a
nice
golden
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
with
almost
no
retention
a
little
bit
of
a
lacing
after
the
head
disappears
but
not
too
much
it
smelled
nice
and
fruity
which
was
nice
definitely
reminded
me
of
blue
moon
a
strong
fruity
and
citrusy
taste
with
no
real
aftertaste
however
the
citrus
flavors
were
slightly
more
evident
in
this
beer
than
in
blue
moon
it
had
a
decent
mouthfeel
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
this
may
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
on
tap
pretty
drinkable
beer
seems
pretty
light
and
not
too
alcoholic
can
definitely
get
lost
in
a
bunch
of
these
and
not
even
realize
it
first
time
id
seen
sunset
wheat
in
this
part
of
the
country
lots
of
fresh
lemon
citrus
and
floral
scents
very
unfiltered
and
cloudy
low
head
retention
almost
takes
like
a
pilsner
and
lemonade
combined
which
isnt
that
bad
of
a
thing
if
this
was
a
hot
day
and
i
just
finished
cutting
the
lawn
or
jogging
this
one
would
hit
the
spot
one
of
the
better
wits
around
body
is
rather
light
and
refreshing
with
a
slick
wheaty
mouthfeel
and
soft
creamy
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
is
the
most
attractive
aspect
of
this
beer
this
beer
is
way
too
sweet
for
me
this
might
be
a
good
way
to
get
someone
into
beer
by
hitting
them
with
this
sugary
wit
but
for
someone
who
knows
the
style
a
little
better
i
would
not
recommend
this
its
just
way
too
sugary
drinkability
is
poor
if
i
drank
more
than
a
few
it
would
feel
like
i
just
ate
dessert
definitely
a
one
or
2
kinda
beer
drinkability
i
had
this
sitting
inside
with
okay
weather
outside
i
imagine
this
beer
would
have
tasted
a
little
better
if
i
was
sitting
outside
on
a
sunny
day
not
bad
but
the
taste
is
almost
too
artificial
for
me
11
84
6pack
with
tax
included
ouch
im
glad
theres
a
note
added
about
blueberry
being
added
i
thought
i
might
have
been
handed
a
wachusett
blueberry
by
accident
theres
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
which
is
a
good
place
to
start
the
flavor
is
just
too
spiceyfruity
mostly
blueberry
theres
hardly
any
normal
beer
flavors
i
like
those
but
maybe
im
just
a
stickler
i
tried
this
right
after
an
allagash
white
but
there
is
no
comprison
the
allagash
blows
this
away
but
the
leinie
is
lighter
so
it
may
be
better
after
a
hot
day
light
and
tangy
with
some
pleasing
puckering
tartness
would
taste
great
after
mowing
the
lawn
too
much
of
a
ladies
drink
for
meit
does
go
down
easily
though
if
you
like
lemonade
give
it
a
try
pours
a
hazy
golden
orange
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
has
pretty
good
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
is
highly
fruity
with
mainly
orange
and
blueberry
notes
and
a
touch
of
spice
the
smell
is
too
artificiallike
and
smells
a
lot
like
fruit
loops
or
fruity
pebbles
the
taste
has
a
noticeable
wheat
characteristics
with
more
of
the
artificial
fruitcitrus
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
too
undercarbonated
and
watery
overall
this
is
just
too
artificial
for
my
liking
would
make
a
great
beverage
for
the
women
and
kids
though
pours
a
cloudy
orange
with
a
big
two
finger
head
head
settles
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
big
on
sweet
orange
and
wheat
slightly
articifical
smelling
taste
is
oranges
pineapple
and
blueberries
too
sweet
moutfeel
is
rather
thin
with
a
cloying
swallow
sugar
stays
on
your
tounge
long
after
swallowing
way
too
sweet
to
drink
more
than
one
an
interesting
alternative
to
blue
moon
but
not
necessarily
better
pours
light
orange
slight
translucency
a
finger
and
a
half
of
foamy
head
quickly
dissipating
slight
lacing
throughout
nose
is
immediately
sweet
wheats
like
fruit
loops
taste
follow
with
a
fruit
loopiness
up
front
sugary
and
wheaty
but
does
balance
out
a
bit
that
sweetness
sticks
in
the
back
of
your
mouth
a
bit
though
not
your
standard
witbier
interesting
and
good
after
some
heavier
beers
a
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
beer
but
because
of
all
the
fruit
taste
and
smell
in
this
beer
i
cant
drink
more
than
2
at
a
time
still
a
good
summertime
beer
about
what
i
expected
nothing
incredible
but
not
bad
either
its
better
than
blue
moon
anyway
not
something
id
buy
again
but
finishing
up
the
six
pack
wont
be
an
unpleasant
task
overall
this
is
a
fair
beer
not
as
bad
as
others
have
said
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
its
better
than
other
wits
ive
had
i
think
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
one
might
get
the
beer
farts
if
sessioned
though
poured
from
a
bottle
its
a
rather
cloudy
orange
brew
with
a
big
chunky
head
the
nose
consists
mostly
of
orange
wheat
and
malt
its
a
sweet
citrusy
beer
the
malt
is
repressed
and
the
hops
nearly
nonexistant
its
actually
a
fairly
thin
beer
as
far
as
mouthfeel
goes
but
the
finish
is
rather
syrupy
it
goes
down
easily
but
i
have
a
feeling
the
sweet
finish
will
get
to
be
cloying
after
a
couple
beers
poured
a
pale
goldenorange
and
very
cloudy
thin
white
head
of
tight
bubbles
shows
weak
retention
but
leaves
nice
big
whisps
of
sticky
lace
the
nose
is
of
orangescented
pinesol
the
lager
yeast
seems
to
have
stripped
this
of
the
normal
ale
aromas
and
replaced
it
with
a
strange
interpretation
of
orange
rind
faint
wheat
distant
crystal
malt
and
an
odd
acetaldehyde
note
sweet
upfront
with
wheat
and
light
crystal
malt
on
the
tip
of
the
tounge
the
citrus
flavor
kicks
in
with
a
vengence
and
brings
some
pineapple
and
cherry
esters
with
it
graham
crackers
and
citrus
hold
on
well
into
the
drying
aftertaste
a
passable
balance
is
achieved
with
mildly
fruity
american
hop
flavor
and
a
muted
bitterness
this
sure
is
one
wierd
wit
a
lot
of
unexpected
flavors
to
sort
out
but
i
wont
say
i
dont
like
brewers
pushing
the
boundaries
the
lighter
mouthfel
is
given
texture
from
the
wheat
and
the
medium
carbonation
seems
snappy
and
lively
probably
due
to
some
acetaldehyde
action
finishes
somewhat
candyish
a
bit
too
sweet
and
overly
fruity
i
cant
say
it
would
be
the
best
summer
guzzler
but
perhaps
the
brewers
will
tweak
the
recipe
and
end
up
with
a
cool
concept
brew
terrible
beer
if
you
can
call
it
that
it
was
like
drinking
fermented
pop
i
generally
like
leine
but
this
was
just
an
awful
one
to
try
and
finish
almost
no
head
any
foam
at
the
beginning
fizzed
away
in
seconds
like
a
club
soda
doesnt
even
taste
like
hops
were
used
in
making
it
two
words
boo
berry
this
just
needs
some
marshmallows
and
itd
be
the
perfect
kids
beer
seriously
its
that
bad
i
usually
love
witbier
but
im
thinking
about
pouring
this
one
down
the
sink
the
sickeningly
sweet
blueberry
bubblegum
aftertaste
is
making
wish
i
was
drinking
something
better
like
i
hate
to
say
it
bud
light
yeah
sunset
wheat
is
almost
that
bad
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
an
orange
hue
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retentionand
lacing
smell
is
of
citrusand
spice
nice
but
a
bit
weak
body
is
light
to
mediumand
carbonated
taste
is
of
orange
creamand
spice
sweet
but
with
a
nice
edge
in
the
finish
this
is
a
good
version
of
this
style
take
a
pass
unless
youre
on
a
lakeshore
in
wisconsin
this
july
itll
work
just
fine
then
honestly
the
most
fruity
beer
ive
ever
had
i
like
it
its
refreshing
easy
drinking
good
carbonation
and
leaves
you
thinking
what
the
hell
is
this
beer
hard
to
even
describe
orange
berry
lemon
etc
etc
name
a
fruit
it
may
be
in
here
i
stopped
by
a
local
store
in
concord
nh
and
to
my
surprisement
they
carried
a
good
selection
for
being
nh
i
bought
a
six
pack
of
this
along
with
some
others
and
this
is
a
very
good
wheat
beer
its
almost
as
good
as
the
flying
gooses
wheat
beer
they
have
an
awesome
wheat
beer
that
is
no
comparison
this
is
a
dangerously
drinkable
summer
beer
an
excellent
gateway
beer
and
all
around
a
tasty
beverage
id
recommend
this
one
warning
it
could
be
very
easy
to
drink
bottle
after
bottle
of
this
stuff
if
you
consider
that
a
bad
thing
this
brew
may
have
some
crossover
appeal
and
will
certainly
become
more
enjoyable
as
the
weather
warms
but
ill
likely
find
many
other
beers
to
choose
from
cloudy
yelloworange
wheat
on
tap
at
buffalo
raceway
brewfest
moderately
cidery
aroma
sourness
aggressive
carbonation
and
drying
average
drinkability
medium
to
lighter
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
wheat
in
here
a
summer
beer
served
by
surprise
at
the
end
of
winter
and
not
too
unwelcome
as
is
the
style
this
brew
is
very
drinkable
a
bit
heavy
on
the
citrus
though
for
my
taste
im
sure
this
is
served
on
tap
with
a
giant
orange
slice
on
the
glass
which
would
just
put
it
over
the
edge
into
complete
overkill
a
little
lighter
on
the
fruit
and
a
bit
heavier
on
the
wheat
and
i
could
really
get
into
it
it
has
peaked
my
interest
into
looking
for
other
leinenkugel
brews
served
on
tap
at
pjw
in
blue
bell
cloudy
and
opaque
in
appearance
with
a
thin
white
collar
of
foam
aroma
was
citrusy
and
with
a
hint
of
blueberries
the
flavor
was
mild
by
witbier
standards
almost
like
a
hoegaarden
mixed
with
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
there
was
a
definite
fake
froot
loops
quality
in
the
flavor
as
well
not
bad
not
good
just
present
oh
and
of
course
there
was
the
lovely
blueberry
taste
as
well
very
pleasant
unless
you
dislike
blueberries
i
suppose
mouthfeel
was
light
crisp
and
went
down
smoothly
if
by
chance
i
ever
see
this
beer
again
it
would
drink
well
on
a
warm
summer
evening
nice
job
12
oz
bottle
brewed
with
malted
wheat
cluster
hops
coriander
and
hints
of
blueberry
it
pours
into
the
weizen
glass
a
cloudy
peachtangerine
with
medium
carbonation
that
builds
up
two
fingers
of
white
head
before
reducing
to
an
eighth
of
a
inch
and
distributing
sparse
lacing
it
smells
of
orange
juice
and
blueberry
muffins
with
a
light
spiciness
and
maybe
some
anise
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
with
airy
carbonation
and
flavors
of
tart
wheat
orange
peelorange
soda
spicy
coriander
a
lemony
twang
blueberry
and
perhaps
some
banana
all
of
which
combine
to
impart
a
medium
finish
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
and
one
i
found
to
have
both
witbier
and
american
pale
wheat
characteristics
i
went
in
a
little
weary
but
came
out
rather
impressed
and
surprised
ill
have
to
visit
more
of
leinenkugles
lineup
soon
nice
cloudy
pour
with
a
decent
head
light
amber
looks
nice
wtf
is
that
smell
the
trix
reviewers
are
right
they
have
hit
the
nose
on
this
beer
smells
like
nothing
natural
on
gods
green
earth
smells
like
man
created
citrus
taste
is
actually
not
bad
some
lemon
zing
some
wheat
but
then
than
smell
comes
back
at
you
smooth
body
great
mouthfeel
and
a
good
drinkability
but
youve
got
to
be
able
to
get
past
the
smell
to
enjoy
the
benefits
this
beer
has
to
offer
bottom
line
a
nice
refreshing
example
of
the
style
that
should
help
with
the
summer
time
heat
i
like
it
overall
leinenkugel
sunset
wheat
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
product
that
is
fruity
and
easy
drinking
it
is
less
expensive
than
other
craft
beer
and
leinenkugel
products
enjoy
a
wide
distribution
base
im
enjoying
mine
right
now
in
the
cold
of
winter
but
this
seems
like
a
beer
that
was
made
for
the
summer
season
the
light
refreshment
and
the
fruity
flavor
make
it
a
fine
brew
for
warm
weather
drinking
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
could
definitely
be
a
crossover
beer
too
better
luck
next
time
leiny
the
mouth
feel
had
a
bit
of
a
snag
for
me
though
there
was
a
lingering
thick
sandy
feeling
on
my
tongue
that
got
worse
as
i
finished
the
pint
i
think
that
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
was
that
an
allergic
reaction
i
really
recommend
this
beer
if
you
want
to
try
something
different
and
fruity
so
i
liked
the
color
and
hazy
hue
of
this
witbier
i
assume
the
name
sunset
may
have
been
inspired
by
the
look
of
this
beer
served
in
a
round
goblet
it
is
very
aromatic
and
fruity
to
the
nose
i
would
call
the
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
and
the
flavor
lingers
a
bit
after
swallowing
this
beer
is
very
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
the
only
thing
i
would
like
to
see
changed
is
the
blueberry
shot
is
a
bit
overwhelming
nice
to
see
a
larger
brewery
going
up
against
blue
moon
coors
belgian
white
ale
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
most
likely
not
be
buying
again
it
is
just
too
hard
to
drink
too
sweet
for
my
taste
not
all
that
reminiscent
of
the
wit
bier
style
it
trys
to
emulate
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watered
down
not
quite
as
noticable
though
if
served
colder
finishes
on
the
dry
side
i
agree
with
what
most
people
have
said
about
the
beer
the
best
part
of
the
beer
was
the
color
and
head
the
beer
had
an
overwhelming
smell
and
taste
of
lemon
zest
the
lemon
flavor
and
aroma
was
completely
over
powering
the
first
few
sips
were
enjoyable
but
after
that
the
flavors
were
to
much
i
sruggled
through
the
bottle
this
beer
was
served
to
me
on
draft
it
appeared
to
be
a
murky
greenish
yellow
color
with
no
head
the
smell
was
extremely
fruity
rather
nice
the
taste
was
a
bit
like
cough
syrup
mixed
with
a
liquified
lemon
candy
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
as
for
drinkablity
this
beer
would
be
a
bit
much
for
me
it
made
my
mouth
pucker
if
you
like
fruity
beers
this
would
be
worth
a
try
sugary
and
full
of
fruit
flavors
up
front
with
some
balance
following
but
not
really
enough
to
keep
this
one
grounded
heavy
blueberries
and
citrus
but
waaaay
too
sweet
for
me
mouthfeel
is
respectable
but
doesnt
ssave
the
taste
for
me
this
is
an
overdone
fruit
beer
as
oppossed
to
a
wit
there
is
some
tallent
here
its
just
flawed
and
need
some
tweaking
it
is
quenching
but
i
just
cant
drink
much
of
it
at
once
maybe
ill
save
the
rest
for
the
summer
because
im
definitely
not
feeling
them
now
md
the
feel
of
this
beer
makes
it
highly
drinkable
i
could
really
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
nice
sunday
but
with
all
the
beers
still
to
try
i
will
have
this
beer
once
in
a
while
definitely
a
one
a
day
beer
a
lot
of
standard
witbier
spice
and
sharp
wheat
are
found
along
with
a
blueberry
flavor
that
adds
a
unique
characteristic
overall
it
seems
pretty
average
the
sweetness
and
candylike
fruitiness
is
too
much
for
me
personally
might
be
okay
in
the
summer
reminds
me
of
a
carbonated
tang
in
a
way
or
better
like
a
fruit
rollup
as
there
is
a
plasticlike
taste
in
the
sweetness
overall
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
few
beers
that
really
stands
out
with
its
uniqueness
i
like
the
fact
that
i
have
not
had
a
beer
similar
to
this
at
all
in
fact
there
are
quite
a
bit
of
characteristics
in
this
beer
that
i
dont
think
are
beerlike
but
it
works
for
me
would
be
great
on
a
hot
afternoon
overall
you
would
swear
you
were
drinking
icedtea
not
horrible
but
this
must
be
served
up
while
floating
in
a
pool
on
a
hot
july
day
drinkability
i
typically
sit
down
with
a
single
brew
over
dinner
but
this
one
i
had
to
grab
a
second
and
would
have
grabbed
a
third
had
i
not
wanted
to
save
them
for
the
rest
of
the
week
coming
out
to
4
9
too
make
things
worse
i
hear
this
is
the
worst
hangover
beer
of
alltime
with
all
that
artificial
sweetner
stuff
going
on
i
wouldnt
doubt
it
bought
this
beer
after
hearing
the
raves
about
it
i
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
it
poured
like
a
normal
wheat
beer
no
real
head
no
lacing
tasted
like
fruity
pebbles
nothing
i
will
try
again
especially
with
the
speciality
beer
price
tag
not
the
most
impressive
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
subtle
notes
of
wheat
and
orange
in
the
aroma
but
the
taste
kicked
it
up
a
notch
rich
and
tangy
for
a
wit
full
bodied
wheats
with
touches
of
an
orangey
citrus
very
nick
drinker
ill
make
sure
i
pick
some
up
for
the
wifzilla

whom
luvs
this
style
poured
light
and
cloudy
with
a
moderate
spice
character
and
aroma
slightly
sweet
malts
and
no
real
hop
presence
not
exactly
balanced
not
sure
what
the
natural
flavors
are
which
this
beer
is
brewed
with
but
the
taste
is
overwhelmingly
artificially
fruity
mix
a
bag
of
pop
rocks
with
a
miller
lite
same
effect
the
only
saving
grace
was
that
it
went
down
smooth
and
fast
with
no
real
problem
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
were
it
not
winter
now
i
could
easily
see
putting
a
few
away
on
a
hot
summer
day
12
ouncer
wo
freshness
indication
pours
typical
cloudy
light
tangerine
with
a
near
white
head
that
quickly
morphs
to
a
thin
tiny
bubble
film
a
moderate
swirl
leaves
respectable
sticky
lacing
lemony
sweet
nose
then
a
pleasant
smooth
yeasty
lemony
wheat
experience
nice
american
wheat
decent
warm

quaffer
nothing
amazing
but
would
do
with
a
warm

lunch
salad
cheesebread
etc
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellowgold
color
wiht
a
fizzy
white
head
the
smell
is
huge
i
can
smell
it
from
a
foot
away
citrus
orange
and
lemon
dominate
with
coriander
and
other
spices
on
backup
taste
is
very
much
like
the
nose
with
the
orange
citrus
and
coriander
coming
through
the
most
and
has
a
wheaty
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
with
a
decent
amount
of
fizzy
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
for
the
price
youll
be
hard
pressed
to
find
another
as
tasty
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
white
head
into
my
pint
glass
there
is
a
fruity
aroma
that
is
mostly
citrus
taste
is
dominated
by
an
orange
flavor
and
you
can
taste
the
wheat
somewhat
there
also
seems
to
be
some
other
spices
that
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
dont
think
its
something
i
would
buy
all
the
time
but
under
the
right
circumstances
it
quite
enjoyable
worth
a
try
far
too
lopsided
leaning
ridiculously
heavy
toward
the
citrus
and
flavor
37
or
whatever
they
flavor
trix
with
it
forgets
about
the
things
that
make
a
great
wheat
beer
great
never
again
wow
this
is
a
tasty
beer
i
did
not
expect
much
because
it
pours
like
a
typical
macro
brew
from
st
louis
the
head
is
ok
but
subsides
very
fast
the
taste
is
what
is
very
impressive
here
this
brew
tastes
very
much
like
the
breakfast
cereal
fruity
pebbles
it
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
say
the
least
i
give
this
brew
two
mugs
up
pours
with
three
finger
white
head
that
goes
quickly
leaving
a
little
lace
cloudy
amber
color
light
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
apricot
nose
starts
with
a
apricot
flavor
but
is
nicely
balanced
finish
is
clean
unusual
wheat
1
29
for
a
12oz
bottle
from
johns
grocery
iowa
city
ia
still
most
of
the
way
through
the
bottle
its
growing
on
me
its
actually
a
surprisingly
drinkable
brew
just
might
end
up
picking
up
some
more
at
a
later
time
has
a
nice
full
flavor
taste
that
is
smooth
the
tartness
really
comes
through
as
well
as
an
aftertaste
of
blueberrys
and
light
grain
goes
great
with
the
usual
orange
wedge
on
the
side
a
very
appealing
summer
beer
however
not
one
i
would
drink
several
of
at
one
time
body
is
a
hazy
dull
yellow
smallish
white
head
is
fleeting
and
leaves
some
patchy
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
fruity
with
orange
and
lemongrass
competing
with
some
pepper
and
coriander
notes
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
selzery
spritzy
carbonation
taste
mirrors
the
aroma
lemonrind
and
coriander
with
a
hint
of
pepper
and
malted
wheat
thin
and
unsubtantial
very
refreshing
and
bargain
priced
a
nice
pale
wheat
ale
for
summer
sessions
otherwise
unremarkable
this
beer
took
me
by
surprise
a
friend
had
a
bunch
in
the
fridge
which
his
brother
in
law
brought
and
he
had
not
tried
it
we
opened
it
and
there
was
not
much
to
the
smell
beyond
the
typical
citrus
for
a
wheat
beer
when
i
took
a
swig
though
the
berry
flavor
was
kind
of
a
shock
since
it
did
not
mention
it
on
the
label
very
unusual
but
as
i
finished
it
off
i
decided
it
was
a
good
thing
the
appearance
even
though
i
had
it
out
of
the
bottle
i
could
tell
was
the
cloudy
gold
you
would
expect
mouthfeel
was
light
and
well
carbonated
i
had
three
of
them
and
at
that
it
was
not
overpowering
so
i
figure
the
drinkability
was
pretty
high
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
want
to
overdo
it
beer
poured
a
very
cloudy
banana
color
with
very
little
head
the
smell
is
a
bit
of
yeast
and
very
strong
citrus
flavoring
it
is
the
same
in
taste
it
almost
tastes
like
they
used
some
super
citrus
candy
extract
to
create
this
flavor
because
it
is
almost
unnatural
not
pleasant
at
all
and
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
carbonation
was
sharp
and
in
pair
with
the
flavor
really
sealed
the
deal
on
this
brew
not
being
worth
it
i
am
shocked
to
see
the
ratings
that
others
have
given
it
lord
i
just
hope
the
lines
were
dirty
at
the
bar
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
served
with
an
orange
slice
as
well
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
nose
mostly
citrus
and
thats
about
it
taste
was
very
light
and
citrusy
tons
of
lemon
orange
coriander
not
much
hops
going
on
but
it
is
tasty
nonetheless
it
definitely
had
a
fizzy
and
thin
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
light
wheat
ale
something
that
would
hit
the
spot
in
july
but
not
very
welcoming
now
midjanuary
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
is
a
delicious
tasting
beer
if
you
enjoy
fruity
flavors
in
beers
it
is
a
bit
of
an
over
the
top
version
and
is
probably
a
very
polaring
flavor
ill
drink
it
again
maybe
just
not
in
mass
quantity
like
other
brews
overall
not
something
i
would
buy
on
my
own
as
this
was
a
case
club
selection
i
wasnt
expecting
much
with
this
one
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
could
i
drink
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
likely
not
but
its
still
a
solid
brew
in
all
aspects
that
ill
likely
pick
up
again
and
that
is
certainly
worth
a
try
im
really
trying
to
step
outside
myself
here
since
i
dont
really
like
this
style
of
beer
very
much
and
i
really
would
have
considered
it
a
whitbier
rather
than
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
be
that
as
it
may
it
has
an
unfiltered
cloudy
appearance
with
a
volumnous
cloud
of
white
frothy
foam
after
the
pour
the
smell
piña
colada
cotton
candy
ripe
oranges
and
coconut
the
taste
pretty
much
what
youd
expect
from
the
smell
orange
julius
interesting
again
not
to
my
taste
but
i
think
the
brewer
really
put
his
or
her
mark
on
this
beer
and
i
gotta
respect
that
nevertheless
i
think
the
cacauphony
of
flavors
overwhelm
the
malt
and
the
beer
part
gets
lost
which
is
never
a
good
thing
moderately
full
body
especially
considering
the
fruity
overtones
i
can
see
where
this
could
be
a
quite
refreshing
drink
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
cloudy
yellow
in
color
with
loads
of
carbonation
head
is
bright
white
and
thick
at
first
it
also
sticks
around
the
whole
time
with
some
lacing
smells
like
lemon
and
other
citrus
maybe
a
little
bread
there
but
its
predominantly
lemon
taste
is
also
extremely
citrusy
as
though
a
bunch
of
lemon
juice
got
in
the
batch
which
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
it
could
be
more
subdued
there
is
also
a
bit
of
biscuit
taste
in
the
end
mouthfeel
is
fine
way
too
much
carbonation
for
me
it
feels
like
im
drinking
soda
this
could
be
refreshing
on
summers
day
seems
like
it
would
be
good
for
folks
who
arent
into
beer
yet
recommended
oh
and
did
i
mention
it
came
with
a
sunset
wheat
flavored
chapstickjust
added
bonus
to
run
and
try
this
beer
uhm
yeah
this
one
pours
a
cloudy
light
orange
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
smell
is
very
fruity
orange
cherry
lots
of
sweet
notes
reminds
me
of
fruity
pebbles
cereal
the
tase
was
mostly
orange
but
many
fruit
notes
tasted
like
cereal
but
not
in
a
super
offensive
what
happened
to
this
beer
sort
of
way
there
wasnt
much
else
to
the
taste
the
wheat
was
there
but
the
fruit
drives
this
beer
beginning
middle
and
end
it
had
a
good
balance
to
it
being
a
mediumlight
beer
with
good
carbonation
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
more
that
a
few
just
from
the
powerful
taste
but
it
was
nice
and
refreshing
worth
checking
out
if
especially
if
you
are
into
the
fruit
beers
i
dont
know
why
they
call
it
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
no
hops
to
speak
of
and
very
little
wheat
oh
well
leinenkugels
makes
good
beer
for
the
low
price
enjoy
this
beer
started
out
promising
but
turned
to
disappointment
quickly
addendum
ive
just
been
reading
other
reviews
of
this
beer
i
never
do
that
before
i
review
am
i
nuts
does
no
one
else
get
blueberry
muffins
out
of
this
thing
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
me
i
mean
in
a
blind
smell
test
i
couldnt
tell
the
difference
between
this
beer
and
a
muffin
if
you
put
a
gun
to
my
head
maybe
ive
got
a
very
unusual
brain
tumor
jakes
lemony
and
berryish
sunset
wheat
really
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
not
that
there
are
an
overabudance
of
those
in
wisconsin
or
even
a
cold
winter
night
with
friends
gathered
round
it
pours
a
cloudy
gold
thats
almost
like
brass
and
a
huge
head
of
frothy
white
the
retention
is
quite
good
and
the
head
slowly
dwindles
to
a
wide
collar
of
creamy
bright
white
along
with
a
cottony
almostsolid
surface
covering
it
continually
leaves
lace
throughout
the
glass
in
wide
craggy
splashes
very
nice
its
so
fruity
in
the
nose
that
you
might
initially
think
youve
poured
the
berry
wheat
mistakenly
until
you
realize
its
more
citrusy
lime
it
is
juicy
and
tangy
like
berries
though
as
it
warms
the
wheaty
malt
becomes
apparent
as
does
some
spice
grains
of
paradise
white
pepper
maybe
its
just
from
the
yeast
doubtful
its
a
touch
peachy
and
apricotlike
as
well
its
smooth
across
the
palate
with
a
gentle
zest
of
carbonation
and
lightmedium
body
the
flavor
is
as
the
nose
suggests
with
citrusy
flavors
dominating
a
light
sweet
somewhat
wheaty
malt
base
the
bitterness
is
limited
but
its
balanced
by
the
tartness
of
the
citrus
quite
refreshing
and
interesting
to
boot
its
drinkability
might
be
up
in
the
air
depending
upon
what
you
like
but
if
youre
open
to
a
fruity
and
citrusy
beer
this
one
might
work
overall
a
solid
hefewheat
beer
recommended
mouthfeel
is
thinner
than
some
other
unfiltered
american
wheat
ales
out
there
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
warm
day
and
sessionable
at
4
9
abv
i
could
and
sometimes
do
have
two
or
three
it
is
widely
available
at
restaurants
in
my
area
often
served
with
a
slice
of
orange
but
there
are
other
beers
id
prefer
if
they
were
available
at
those
locations
this
one
is
worth
trying
edit
i
had
this
beer
33006
very
strong
blueberry
presence
like
a
blueberry
muffin
the
beer
poured
a
cloudy
medium
tan
with
a
ample
white
head
that
lasted
a
fair
amount
of
time
that
left
a
large
circle
of
foam
around
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
of
coriander
was
the
outstanding
smell
with
some
hops
and
a
little
malt
thrown
in
the
coriander
came
through
on
the
tongue
as
well
and
dominated
the
little
malt
sweetness
no
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
light
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
a
nice
wheat
beer
but
not
outstanding
in
any
aspect
the
most
noticeable
feature
of
this
beer
was
the
smell
especially
that
smell
you
get
when
you
have
a
mouthful
perfumy
my
god
was
it
powerful
sort
of
like
industrial
strength
janitor
in
a
drum
i
got
the
impression
they
must
have
flavor
this
stuff
with
a
used
urinal
mint
certainly
will
not
replace
hoegaarden
in
my
beer
fridge
drinkability
im
not
real
big
on
the
leines
but
i
have
been
more
likely
to
choose
a
leinenkugel
than
a
miller
bud
or
coors
not
real
excited
about
the
recent
barely
beers
being
produced
by
this
local
legend
is
miller
going
to
use
this
brand
to
straddle
the
boundary
between
alchopops
and
beer
ugh
do
not
add
citrus
fruit
to
this
beer
overall
impression
impressed
figured
this
for
an
easy
karma
point
and
really
ended
up
enjoying
it
a
lot
of
good
things
going
on
in
this
beer
and
no
obvious
flaw
well
maybe
the
body
and
carbonation
level
and
the
fact
that
it
is
tied
with
miller
damn
you
miller
a
great
summer
brew
ill
look
for
this

the

with
a
thick
frothy
white

that
fades
to

the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
wonderful

that
compliments
the
sweet

aroma
it

good

not

though
its
too
sweet
for
that
i
got
to
say
first
of
all
this
is
the
best
damn
wheat
ale
i
have
ever
had
and
i
am
very
suprised
that
leines
could
make
a
wheat
ale
this
good
ok
to
start
things
off
this
ale
is
brewed
with
superb
malted
wheats
tasty
cluster
hops
and
a
natural
coriander
with
a
pale
cloudy
goldish
colour
sunset

has
a
soothing

that
will
leave
you
speachless
its
kind
of
like

its
also
the
best
serve
chilled
at
a
stellar
40f
overall
impression
this
is
obviously
meant
to
take
a

its
not
a
bad

id
take
a
blue
moon
over
this
any
day
poured
from
a
12oz

by
date
on

into
a

a
yellowish
color
with
good
head
that
slowly
dissipated

the
smell
was
heavy
on
the

strong
overtones
of
taragonblack
licorice
the
taste
followed
the
smell
and
was
way
too
reliant
on
the
extreme
citrus
found
it
hard
to
finish
the
beer
because
of
the
strong

read
some

on

was
excited
to
try
but
already
looking

up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
good
amount
of
wheat
in
the
nose
along
with
some
spicy
coriander
that

coriander
is
a
bit
overpowering
in
the
taste
but
there
is
another
strong
lemony
almost
like
a
lemon
scented
cleanser
flavor
that
stands
out
seems
out
of
place
for
the
style
new
in
town
got
a
six
pack
at
albertsons
the
aroma
invokes
a
picturesque
stroll
through
an
orange
grove
the
sweet
yet
subtle
scent
of
orange
blossoms
lingers
in
the
air
and
you
imagine
you
can
even
smell
a
bit
of
the
bitter
notes
of
orange
peel
and
snapped
citrus
branches
then
you
step
on
the
skunk
lurking
below

feet

he
sprays
you
with
his
own
special

to
recap

the
body
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
the
color
of
a
sick
canary
and
holds
a
diminishing
pinky
sized
white
head
the
flavor
offers
sweetened
cereal
grains
in
the
fore
reminiscent
of
the
sugary
milk
slop
youd
gulp
down
after
finishing
your
sweetum
smacks
as
fuel
for
a
vigorous
saturday
morning
of
cartoon
watching
some
orange
dreamsicle
notes
appear
bursting
with
artificial
orange
and
cream
the
effect
is
very
manufactured
in
that
the
flavors
seem
chemically
induced
through
additives
rather
than
from
the
brewing
process
but
i
guess
brewing
is
chemistry
im
not
saying
the
sweetness
is
artificial
it
very
well
may
not
be
but
it
does
taste
artificial
its
not
awful
but
it
is
sickly
sweet
and
rather
reminds
me
of
some
poorly
made
fruit
beers
with
its
sweet
intensity
the
taste
is
out
of
this
world
just
enough
carbonation
to
tingle
the
tongue
but
little
enough
to
make
it
feel
incredibly
smooth
in
your
mouth
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
water
expect
to
finish
your
entire
6pack

quickly

leinenkugels
better
efforts
a
fun
beer
to

oh
yeh
i
must
add
not
that
this
has
anything
to
do
with
my
rating
good
luck
trying
to
find
something
to
eat
with
this
the
taste
is
so
citrusy
it
goes
awful
with
pizza
crackers
cheese
etc
i
guess
id
recomment
eating
fruit
with
this
if
you
like
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
into
my
wheat
beer
glass
nice
white
head
that
it
retains
well
and
it
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
isnt
what
i
expected
citrusy
and
some
spices
tastes
citrusy
the
coriander
is
too
strong
and
it
has
almost
a
chemical
taste
it
reminds
me
of
suntan
lotion
well
how
it
smells
i
dont
get
the
funk
others
are
talking
about

dont

wish
i
didnt

5
more

hazy
nice

nonexistent

of
strong
wheat

good
wheat
flavor
citrusy
but
coriander
is
much
stronger
and
out
of
balance
almost
soapy
powdery
texture
a
little
watery
in
the
body
overall
a
pretty
decent
wheat
ale
very
impresive
for
a
macro
type
offering
thanks
to
makeitavintage
for
this
one
pretty
bad
when
you
have
to
scour
your
pantry
for
something
to
take
the
taste
out
of
your
mouth
garden
herb
triscuits
did
it
pleasantly
surprised
the
first
good
beer
ive
had
from
leinenkugel
i
would
buy
this
again
and
i
think
i
will
snatch
up
a
6
pack
before
they
disappear
as
they
are
probably
falling
out
of
season
this
is
nearly
as
good
as
vuuve
in
a
similar
way
and
celis
in
a
different
way
and
far
surpasses
blue
moon
and
sam
adams
as
far
as
macrobrewed
wits
go
recommended
d
not
too
bad
i
kind
of
like
the
funkiness
in
this
one
was
the
best
brew
from
leinenkugel
that
i
had
in
my
opinion
pours
a
hazy
yellow
copper
with
quickly
dissipating
head
the
smell
is
anise
candy
citrus
bubble
gum
and
or
fruity
pebbles
taste
is
not
bad
but
there
is
medium
to
weak
body
the
complexity
is
all
in
front
and
doesnt
last
through
the
end
honestly
it
doesnt
do
too
much
for
me
and
i
wont
buy
it
again
thank
heavens
a
friend
gave
it
to
me
and
i
didnt
buy
it
if
you
want
a
real
wheat
beer
this
is
not
it
leave
this
to
the
kids
drinkability
was
right
where
it
should
have
been
d
i
could
barely
finish
this
one
i
love
wheat
ales
but
this
just
about
killed
me
my
mom
would
love
this
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
to
a
creamy
18inch
head
that
lasts
the
entire
drink
excellent
aroma
with
the
strong
smell
of
orange
and
hints
of
lemon
zest
and
blueberry
i
loved
the
taste
of
this
beer
true
its
different
but
that
is
part
of
the
appeal
very
smooth
taste
with
a
citrus
fruity
flavor
that
is
very
refreshing
cloudy
yellow
with
a
thin
head
of
tiny
white
boubles
aroma
is
strange
but
not
altogether
offputting
mix
of
lemon
zest
and
peptobismal
this
beer
is
light
bodied
and
very
high
in
astringincy
with
a
thin
and
artifical
citrus
flavor
that
is
seriously
like
drinking
the
yellow
fruit
loops
honestly
im
kinda
into
this
but
it
is
very
funky
and
near
the
bottom
of
my
list
for
the
style
and
the
brewery
refreshing
though
the
appearance
is
lightstraw
and
cloudy
smell
is
lemony
the
taste
is
very
unique
like
oranges
and
lemons
and
fresh
cut
flowers
with
very
little
noticeable
malt
or
hops
a
number
of
my
friends
have
compared
this
to
blue
moon
but
i
find
it
to
be
quite
different
in
a
good
way
worth
trying
once
i
happened
to
enjoy
orange
creamsicles
as
a
kid
and
as
such
i
found
this
to
be
drinkable
and
enjoyed
how
it
took
me
back
to
summer
as
a
kid
it
wasnt
much
of
a
beer
but
was
enjoyable
in
more
of
a
guilty
pleasure
fashion
could
knock
a
few
of
these
back
although
i
would
suggest
avoiding
it
if
you
dont
like
orange
creamsicles
might
make
a
good
crossover
beer
for
an
appropriately
targeted
audience
i
tried
this
beer
very
quickly
after
it
came
out
as
i
am
a
huge
leinenkugels
fan
it
did
not
disappoint
pours
a
goldenorange
color
with
a
nice
head
has
hints
of
citrus
and
blueberry
in
the
aroma
the
taste
was
great
a
nice
fullness
with
hints
of
blueberry
citrus
and
corriander
a
very
refreshing
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
i
believe
will
still
stand
up
for
a
fuller
winter
beer
this
is
the
kind
of
sour
you
get
from
kissing
your
own
sisteri
can
say
this
because
i
dont
have
one
sour
because
she
is
beautiful
and
you
are
in
love
and
you
have
yet
to
learn
that
she
is
indeed
your
sister
a
chance
encounter
kind
of
sour
but
with
this
one
youre
perpetually
suspended
in
the
moment
that
you
are
first
told
so
that
sour
is
good
and
the
world
is
still
beautiful
and
youre
in
love
and
your
sister
is
still
your
girl
you
get
the
point
a
renegade
wheat
beer
with
a
pucker
face
that
doesnt
go
into
a
full
blown
suck
light
citrusy
and
tangy
as
a
nine
volt
battery
not
a
bad
ale
but
just
the
same
it
is
not
one
to
get
excited
about
miller
brewing
introduced
this
beer
to
counteract
the
success
their
rival
coors
brewing
had
had
with
their
blue
moon
offering
after
pouring
a
glass
of
the
leinenkugels
sunset
wheat
out
i
notice
that
it
had
a
distinct
blond
appearance
much
similar
to
that
of
blue
moon
the
smell
was
uninspiring
after
tasting
the
beer
i
was
pleased
to
find
a
nice
sweet
and
smooth
taste
the
beer
gopes
down
easy
and
it
doesnt
take
long
for
1
beer
to
be
finished
off
i
am
disappointed
to
report
that
the
relative
differences
between
this
and
blue
moon
are
farely
undistinguishable
in
my
opinion
however
this
beer
does
feel
good
while
watching
the
sun
set
over
a
midwestern
lake
not
a
bad
beer
for
the
summer
months
at
all
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
has
some
time
to
kill
up
at
the
lake
or
enjoys
sweet
wheat
beers
im
going
to
stick
with
my
initial
3
5s
across
the
board
here
would
i
choose
this
if
given
the
choice
between
this
and
countless
other
beers
likely
not
but
for
what
it
is
a
no
frills
average
american
wheat
beer
you
can
do
alot
worse
drinkability
an
easy
drinker
not
bad
but
just
too
sweet
for
me
to
enjoy
more
than
one
at
a
time
this
one
be
a
good
chick
beer
or
maybe
for
some
one
who
really
doesnt
like
the
taste
of
beer
and
likes
alcopops
overall
a
surprisingly
tasty
refreshing
summer
wheat
lacking
only
complexity
and
length
was
out
at
a
local
pub
last
night
and
surprised
to
see
this
one
as
the
only
nonbmc
selection
not
totally
true
as
snpa
and
oberon
were
represented
but
have
gotten
a
bit
sated
with
those
lately
anyway
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
very
similar
to
oberon
on
the
whole
orangish
hazy
appearance
with
a
pretty
full
whitishtan
head
smells
of
citrus
typical
orange
aroma
is
theretoo
much
as
unbenownst
to
me
they
brought
the
first
out
with
an
orange
wedge
in
itremedied
the
second
time
also
the
typical
wheat
and
slight
spice
never
sure
what
to
call
itcorrander
smell
pretty
appealing
the
taste
is
wheat
up
front
and
almost
overwhelming
fruity
sweetness
at
the
back
of
the
swallow
oddly
enough
blueberries
overshadowed
the
typical
orange
taste
at
first
this
taste
was
very
appealing
by
the
end
of
the
beer
and
certainly
with
the
second
though
it
becomes
a
bit
too
much
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
and
crisp
nothing
special
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
to
sit
outside
and
drink
on
a
warm
summer
night
though
after
a
second
round
my
mouth
is
screaming
for
heavy
doses
of
water
as
the
sugary
sweetness
has
become
a
bit
too
much
not
to
slam
this
beer
but
overall
i
was
not
overly
impressed
d
maybe
itd
be
better
after
a
long
day
of
sweaty
work
other
than
that
it
aint
that
great
this
is
a
decent
drinkable
beer
good
summer
and
session
brew
leinies
sunset
wheat
is
a
great
alternative
to
the
fine
coriander
taste
of
blue
moon
sunset
wheat
is
a
thinnish
lager
that
pours
nicely
into
a
pint
glass
but
loses
its
head
rather
quickly
i
tasted
orangecoriander
bursts
throughout
this
enjoyable
brew
but
was
very
taken
by
a
strong
impression
of
blueberries
this
beer
will
make
a
great
addition
to
the
leinenkugel
yearround
stable
and
is
heartily
recommended
for
anyone
looking
for
something
a
little
different
for
their
next
cookout
this
tasted
more
like
sprite
or
fresca
than
beer
i
almost
finished
my
cup
my
friends
seemed
to
like
it
though
its
beer
for
people
who
dont
like
beer
pours
out
to
a
light
yellow
cloudy
color
with
a
medium
level
of
carbonation
head
of
white
foam
dissipates
at
a
reasonable
rate
some
lace
aroma
smells
like
the
trix
bunny
crapped
in
my
beer
lots
of
artificial
fruity
smells
berries
citrus
bananas
very
much
trix
like
taste
is
amazingly
similar
trix
mild
maltiness
blends
again
with
medium
fruity
flavors
of
berries
citrus
and
a
touch
of
estery
bananas
some
notes
of
grass
and
hay
mouthfeel
is
good
refreshing
and
bubbly
rather
smooth
drinkability
is
only
average
im
getting
bored
with
this
already
interesting
yet
lackluster
and
contrived
worth
a
sample
i
hadnt
heard
good
things
about
sunset
wheat
but
its
actually
decent
beer
and
is
an
acceptable
summer
quaffer
if
wellchilled
i
have
to
give
leinenkugels
credit
for
thinking
outside
the
box
with
regard
to
the
coriander
and
something
else
too
bad
they
seem
to
have
an
inherent
inabililty
to
brew
truly
good
beer
overall
a
good
little
spring
beer
thats
drinkable
while
not
overpowering
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
blonde
color
with
a
half
inch
carbonated
white
head
which
went
away
pretty
quickly
the
first
scent
i
pick
up
is
of
blueberries
i
can
also
smell
lemon
orange
and
wheatgrains
in
the
beer
as
well
unfortunately
i
was
disappointed
with
the
taste
of
the
beer
considering
how
good
it
smelled
theres
only
a
slight
blueberry
taste
at
first
before
the
wheat
flavor
kicked
in
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
at
all
the
beer
has
a
light
mouthfeel
and
it
does
go
down
pretty
easy
overall
its
just
an
average
beer
there
are
much
better
wheat
beers
out
there
but
i
would
drink
this
again
hazy
dirtywhite
orange
with
a
small
offwhite
head
nose
of
citrus
zest
mainly
lemon
and
orange
rind
light
wheatysiscuit
background
with
some
spice
as
well
perhaps
a
little
too
citrusy
citrus
notes
are
up
front
on
the
palate
orangelemon
jubilee
thankfully
theres
some
malt
to
provide
some
balance
a
dash
of
coriander
finds
its
way
too
the
malt
and
citrus
combine
for
a
fruity
sweet
taste
overall
not
too
bad
but
a
maybe
too
sweet
for
a
pseudowitbier
lemon
bitterness
in
finish
mediumbodied
with
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
dont
think
i
can
have
more
than
two
d
this
beer
was
very
perfume
in
the
apricot
flavor
and
they
tasted
a
bit
artificial
which
made
it
hard
to
get
through
the
bottom
of
the
glass
considering
the
haze
very
light
on
the
wheat
for
what
i
was
expecting
smooth
and
creamy
for
the
most
part
but
overidden
by
a
sugary
sweetness
that
is
not
entirely
pleasant
this
may
just
taste
weird
and
fruity
enough
to
be
a
really
good
crossover
beer
for
some
a
few
girls
i
know
have
tried
this
and
liked
it
who
typically
wont
drink
any
beer
i
offer
them
im
not
sure
if
thats
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
for
this
brew
but
this
is
the
most
innovate
thing
from
leines
i
think
ive
ever
tasted
the
nonbeer
drinkers
at
lunch
the
other
day
were
shocked
when
i
suggested
they
try
this
one
said
i
could
drink
this
the
other
said
this
isnt
beer
its
carbonated
apple
juice
indeed
it
is
beer
unfortunately
it
doesnt
taste
like
beer
and
while
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
refreshing
e
g
over
bbq
on
the
deck
leinies
is
missing
the
point
or
are
they
watching
nonbeer
drinkers
enjoy
it
i
couldnt
help
but
think
perhaps
this
was
leinies
way
of
helping
the
less
enlightened
the
hard
lemonade
crowd
find
the
path
to
malty
bliss
d
me
personally
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
for
myself
however
my
girlfriend
who
is
not
a
beer
drinker
at
all
well
she
likes
a
lambic
every
once
in
a
while
loves
this
beer
and
would
have
it
over
and
over
again
so
for
my
taste
its
a
very
low
drinkability
but
for
others
who
are
new
to
the
style
its
pretty
high
so
i
will
mark
it
as
average
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
has
a
cloudy
pumpkinlike
color
and
a
small
foamy
head
it
smelled
of
orange
and
yeast
it
tasted
like
clove
and
citrus
i
guess
that
may
have
been
the
corriander
there
was
also
a
noticeable
wheat
flavor
it
was
a
little
grainy
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
it
was
fairly
drinkable
but
there
are
many
other
wheat
beers
that
i
would
grab
before
this
version
drinkability
definitely
the
best
brew
ive
had
from
leinies
this
is
an
excellent
thirstquenchingyetsavorable
summer
ale
worth
a
try
for
a
summer
cooler
d
not
bad
but
the
sharp
taste
will
limit
your
chugging

day
good
beer
poured

be
found
finished
is

refreshing
with

though
a
bit
thin
a
nice
drinking
beer
very
refreshing
tastes
like
they
blended
a
nice
witbier
and
an
american
wheat
the
beer
had
a
mildly
murky
yellowness
with
a
soft
white
glaze
yet
disapointing
head
retention
citrusy
with
lemon
and
orange
zest
and
a
rindlike
bittering
spiced
up
with
maybe
a
dash
of

relying

decorate
the

wheats

up

finishes
nicely
crisp
and
clean
except
for
the
lingering
bitterness
if
you
expect
a
typical
wit
style
beer
you
will
be
sorely
disappointed
it
was
served
to
me
in
a
glass
with
an
orange
wedge
i
removed
the
wedge
but
the
beer
maintained
its
overwhelming
citrus
aroma
the
color
is
a
hazy
orange
actually
very
pleasant
the
taste
puts
it
somewhere
between
a
wit
and
a
fruit
beer
too
sweet
as
a
wit
too
dry
for
a
dessert
style
beer
i
think
leinies
would
do
better
off
turning
this
into
a
full
fledged
fruit
beer
such
as
berry
weiss
wont
personally
buy
it
a
case
at
a
time
but
this
is
an
adequate
summer
beer
choice
poured

i

from
this

beer
if
this
was

99
a

as
leinies
sometimes
is
i
would

getting
it

other
than
that
i
will
pass
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
very
hazy
and
very
light
straw
color
with
a
fingersized
head
that
falls
quickly
to
a
small
ring
around
the
top
carbonation
is
not
apparent
aroma
is
very
citrusy
very
fruity
orange
lime
and
lemon
with
corriander
spice
and
a
mild
wheaty
character
its
pleasing
but
a
little
overloaded
for
my
taste
flavor
is
again
dominated
with
citrusy
orange
and
lime
with
the
corriander
spice
backed
by
a
mild
american
wheat
base
it
finishes
very
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
orange
sweetness
hanging
on
with
a
very
mild
bitter
as
well
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
end
of
moderate
with
a
moderate
carbonation
that
keeps
this
one
feeling
lighter
than
it
is
i
just
think
that
this
one
goes
overboard
with
the
fruit
tones
that
should
be
supporting
the
flavors
not
defining
them
i
can
see
where
this
one
will
go
over
well
with
some
as
a
refreshing
drink
in
the
summer
heat
but
ill
not
be
reaching
for
this
one
at
my
local
as
a
goto
this
may
be
a
good
beer
to
wean
folks
off
those
sweet
alco
pops
im
glad
to
see
leines
continuing
to
try
new
beers
perhaps
they
will
launch
a
pale
ale
soon
the
taste
was
so
sweet
and
unbeerlike
that
i
couldnt
even
finish
it
i
tried
to
pass
it
on
my
irish
friend
who
didnt
want
a
beer
to
go
to
waste
even
he
couldnt
do
it
down
the
drain
it
goes
i
wont
buy
this
again
but
i
might
steer
someone
who
is
looking
to
kill
a
summer
thirst
to
buy
this
this
beer
is
out
of
whack
leinies
took
a
technique
of
adding
an
orange
to
your
wheatwit
beer
for
taste
and
completely
brewed
a
beer
that
takes
that
citrusy
taste
and
turns
it
into
overkill
a
really
disappointing
summer
brew
for
less
than
five
dollars
a
six
pack
this
is
one
hell
of
a
solid
summer
beer
part
of
the
leiny
giftpack
i
received
as
a
present
hazy
yellow
straw
color
with
some
orange
around
the
sides
decent
fluffy
medium
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
not
too
much
lacing
aroma
is
quite
sweet
and
quite
citric
with
just
a
moderate
amount
of
coriander
spice
involved
the
spice
is
ok
but
the
whole
smell
in
general
is
fake
and
too
sweet
taste
follows
suit
but
is
even
faker
and
sweeter
it
seems
like
theres
lots
of
aspartame
in
here
and
some
orange
syrup
extract
thinnish
body
does
nothing
this
is
awful
i
couldnt
finish
the
bottle
drinkability
misses
too
bases
on
the
too
pointed
presence
of
lemon
against
anything
else
i
guess
id
drink
it
if
i
had
to
but
they
could
have
done
better
could
have
tried
harder
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
normal
sized
head
nose
is
licorice
and
citrus
flavors
continue
with
spice
and
anise
flavors
with
citruslemon
and
a
dash
of
banana
i
was
completely
very
pleasently
suprised
by
this
one
and
was
sorry
to
see
the
pint
end
very
interesting
merger
of
flavors
creamy
refreshing
delicious
id
definately
have
this
one
again
thanks
to
jhammerly
for
the
bottle
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
which
was
expected
the
drinkability
is
fine
as
well
this
one
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
at
a
campground
overall
not
to
bad
much
better
than
i
expected
will
make
a
decent
summer
offering
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
golden
hue

a

the
aroma
is
for
the
most
part
lemoncitrusrind
the
taste
has
some
wheat
character
but
an
overload
of
lemon
zest
follows
that
and
finishes
the
beer
i
think
the
beer
should
have
a
more
of
a
wheat
base
to
start
and
a
bit
less
lemoncitrus
flavor
i
cant
really
catch
any
hints
of
the
hops
it
tastes
like
somone
has
already
added
a
slice
of
lemon
to
the
beer
its
refreshing
but
the
drinkablity
factor
is
not
high
considering
the
generous
amounts
of
lemoncitrus
found
in

this

back
when

ran
hoegaarden
that
was

after
interbrew
gobbled
it
up
and
instituted
high

maching
to
reduce

wittekerke

the

standing
it
has
the
light

color
and
a
thin

fairly
quickly
dissipating
head
orange
peel
and
spice

greet
the

it
has
a
refreshing

spicy
taste
perfect
for
drinking
with
a
pot
of
mussels
and
pomme
frites
it
is
light
yet
full
flavored
d
unbelievable
this
beer
is
so
full
of
flavor
yet
remarkably
refreshing
its
not
too
heavy
not
too
light
and
nearly
perfectly
balanced
in
truth
its
probably
the
best
white
beer
you
can
grab

strong

delicate
aromas
of
fruit
orange
peel
taste
the
same

average
delightful
like
hoegarden
but
better
the
most
lemony
beer
i
have
ever
had
framed
well
with
yeasty
notes
and
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
looks
great
too

a

disappointing
too
heavy
on
the
sweet
orange
hides
the
yeast
notes
while
it
is
a
witt
from
belgium
there
are
better
examples
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
with
a
nice
drinkable
feel
that
goes
down
easy
and
leaves
no
aftertaste

a
thin

is

is
of

very
easy

drink
pours
a
light
yellow
golden
with
almost
no

faint
taste
of

too
light
besides
the
orange

taste
is
almost
an
afterthought
a
nice
summer
drink
i
liked
this
beer
from
the
very
first
sip
theres
is
a
noticable
level
of
citrus
that
iwill
subdue
your
taste
buds
with
pleasure
that
is
if
you
like
citrus
this
is
a
great
beer
to
charish
after
a
long
hot
day
it
has
a
cool
and
crisp
finish
that
will
make
you
say
ahh
relaxation
time
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
that
im
glad
i
picked
up
it
has
a
nice
mix
of
flavors
that
are
all
traditional
for
the
style
would
drink
again
this
beer
was
an
okay
beer
it
has
an
hazy

golden

to
it
the
aroma
was
a
good
smell
at

i
liked
it
the
taste
was
pretty
good

i
liked
the

it
has

i
would
not

to
reach
for

clean

beer
is
a

i

and
i
think
a

more

to
the
taste
would
have
made
it
that
much
better
i
would
buy
again
o
perhaps
im
being
too
generous
with
this
brew
but
i
feel
it
surpassed
the
81
ba
score
it
has
accrued
tasty
and
refreshing
this
was
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
color
is
strange
but
appealing
the
was
ok
but
a
bit
thin
even
for
a
style
not
noted
for
fullness
drinkability
was
good
i
could
see
throwing
a
sixer
in
a
cooler
for
a
day
of
tubing
or
whatever
overall
an
ok
brew
certainly
not
among
the
best
of
the
style
but
perhaps
a
good
introductory
example
o
not
fantastic
but
a
nice
beer
for
putting
a
bunch
away
on
a
nice
hot
day
thats
what
ill
buy
it
for
and
the
light
carbonation
does
not
help
lacing
zest
i
would
have
been
satisfied
with
a
good
bubble
and
dryness
instead
it
seems
a
bit
filmy
and
sweet
surprising
with
the
huge
head
but
this
one
seemed
a
bit
flat
o
five
more
in
the
fridge
should
go
down
easy
on
a
hot
day
nothing
amazing
but
a
nice
lighter
brew
glad
i
bought
it
man
does
not
live
by
hops
alone
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
beer
to
help
ween
some
friends
of
their
bud
and
miller
lights
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
break
out
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
pretty
decent
wit
light
on
the
spice
character
and
kind
of
overkill
with
the
lemon
but
for
a
can
i
can
drink
it
and
enjoy
it
not
really
my
favorite
style
of
beer
really
quite
far
down
the
list
of
styles
i
like
but
putting
that
aside
this
beer
was
quite
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
a
wheat
beer
that
i
can
actually
drink
i
dont
know
if
thats
good
or
bad
for
me
to
like
a
wheat
beer
overall
i
dont
think
ill
have
this
beer
again
it
really
isnt
my
style
if
i
want
a
belgian
white
ill
stick
to
rickyards
white
overall
not
a
very
good
beer
i
would
not
drink

a

that
doesnt

faintly
musty
tart
lemon
juice
and
orange
zest
upfront
rustic
wheatiness
in
the
middle
with
more
citrus
at
the
finish
super
dry
it
starts
off
really
but
finishes
a
bit
insipid
o
theres
no
denying
the
refreshing
and
overall
light
uplifting
qualities
of
this
beer
it
may
not
really
impress
in
any
single
area
and
the
chalky
character
was
certainly
a
bit
different
but
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
such
as
today
i
finished
this
glass
off
in
no
time
and
could
have
consumed
another
i
want
a
good
wit
to
either
taste
like
hoegaarden
allagash
white
or
triangle
white
but
this
just
doesnt
its
light
and
drinkable
which
it
has
going
for
it
but
thats
it
lack
of
spices
really
kills
this
thing
o
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
but
seems
a
bit
undertoned
solid
but
there
are
better
options
for
this
style
o
an
average
to
below
average
witbier
not
something
i
would
want
to
try
again
mouthfeel
and
overall
this
was
the
perfect
beer
to
get
with

wings
i
could

easily
drank
this

extremely

a

poured
a

yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
very
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
banana
grain
and
spice
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
wheat
plantain
and
subtle
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mild
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
this
one
really
left
me
desiring
more
from
it
the
flavor
was
really
quite
muted
and
didnt
have
a
lot
going
on
in
it
for
the
style
it
was
average
to
say
the
least
but
definitely
nothing
more
than
that
at
least
the
aroma
was
a
little
nicer
to
bring
it
up
above
an
average
brew
of
the
style
worth
trying
for
a
craft
brew
n00b
but
if
you
enjoy
a
good
wit
i
would
look
elsewhere
personally
this
is
great
ale
for
summer
time
nothing
is
over
the
top
and
it
is
very
refreshing

drink

nothing
remarkable
but
a
pleasant
low
key
witbier
light
to
medium
bodied
this
was
a
decent
beer
the
flavor
was
very
balanced
and
had
good
flavor
overall
though
it
was
pretty
average
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wouldnt
be
really
looking
for
it
o
not
a
bad
wit
but
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
one
little
more
plain
jane
than
i
was
expecting
pours
a
murky
light
whitish
yellow
with
a
1
inch
puffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
lots
of
clumpy
sediments
settles
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
after
the
pour
random
streaks
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grains
spices
yeast
and
some
very
fruity
aromas
taste
is
extremely
fruity
up
front
with
some
grain
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
it
doesnt
remind
me
too
much
of
a
traditional
witbier
much
more
fruity
than
others
i
have
tried
in
the
past
sometimes
you
cant
fight
the
latenight
cravings
for
some
brews
amiright
this
one
pours
a
hazy
lemonade
topped
by
about
a
halffinger
or
so
of
short
lived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
bordering
on
sourdough
coriander
lemon
zest
and
a
pinch
or
so
of
cardamom
the
taste
leans
more
heavily
on
the
spicy
side
with
the
cardamom
and
coriander
meshing
with
newcomer
black
pepper
the
lemon
zest
is
still
there
but
a
tad
more
subdued
and
enveloped
by
a
slightly
more
assertive
bit
of
wheat
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crispish
finish
overall
a
nice
easygoing
unpretentious
wit
good
times
really
o
i
was
much
more
impressed
with
this
beer
the
more
i
drank
it
the
appearance
and
smell
are
greatly
lacking
though
overall
i
think
it
is
a
good
beer
especially
for
one
out
of
a
can
cheers
seeing
how
i
drank
this
from
the
can
i
cant
really
give
a
proper
appearance
judgement
so
ill
just
go
about
middle
of
the
road
in
the
rating
going
by
the
general
consensus
typical
wheat
profile
in
the
nose
citrus
zest
and
slightly
metallic
plus
the
can
taste
of
wheat
a
bit
sharp
lemony
zest
and
hints
of
spice
light
body
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
especially
for
a
summertime
tailgate
o
overall
this
was
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
expecting
much
more
but
this
was
simply
an
average
witbier
overall
drinkability
im
going
to
have
to
review
this
again
some
other
day
just
to
make
sure
this
wasnt
a
bad
can
as
it
stands
its
a
horrible
beer
that
i
never
want
to
have
again
but
feel
obligated
to
just
to
make
sure
it
wasnt
skunked
o
this
beer
does
have
some
good
qualities
but
its
certainly
an
uneven
brew
o
i
must
say
my
first
canned
belgian
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
worth
a
shot
for
a
witbier
love
the
wheat
this
is
a
good

in
my
mind
true

goes
down

this

is
a
real
pleasure
to
drink
like
a
wheat
beer
should
be
wittekerke
does
not
coat
your
mouth
nor
get
sticky
instead
it
is
easily
sipped
gulped
and
everything
in
between
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
when
you
are
dying
of
thirst
and
dont
want
to
have
to
taste
much
this
one
pours
a
very
very
light
and
bright
almost
somewhat
hydrated
urine
yellow
in
color
it
smells
of
light
malts
with
a
strange
funk
it
doesnt
smell
like
someone
would
do
this
intentionally
it
almost
smells
like
bmc
salty
grains
no
bueno
it
is
sooo
light
and
there
really
isnt
anything
wit
related
present
its
the
lightest
wit
ive
seen
its
the
lightest
wit
im
smelled
its
the
lightest
wit
ive
tasted
it
doesnt
feature
the
normal
flavors
or
aromas
this
is
far
below
average
in
my
opinion
its
thin
in
body
and
the
flavor
is
so
off
that
this
isnt
even
drinkable
i
know
this
is
fresh
yet
it
falls
sooo
flat
oh
well
avoid
this
one
o
decent
brew
here
that
is
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
really
solid
ice
cold
but
as
it
warmed
it
was
not
nearly
an
enjoyable
its
a
great
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
keep
em
cold
and
put
em
down
comes
out
a
light
yellow
opaque
with
a
thin
white
head
that
has
some
lacing
and
ok
retention
wheat
is
the
main
thing
on
the
nose
here
with
coriander
and
clove
floating
in
the
background
nose
could
do
with
a
bit
more
presence
and
complexity
but
what
is
there
isnt
bad
taste
comes
in
with
again
wheat
coriander
and
clove
and
adds
banana
as
well
it
then
slides
into
a
overly
grainy
into
hop
finish
that
leaves
this
one
really
lacking
everything
up
to
that
grainy
finish
is
great
and
it
just
seems
to
slide
away
at
the
end
good
carbonation
in
this
with
a
nice
light
body
tiny
bit
of
a
hop
puckering
felt
in
there
which
is
a
nice
touch
overall
though
this
thing
does
everything
well
but
the
overly
grainy
taste
leaves
this
falling
short
of
the
mark
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
stuck
around
in
my
glass
for
quite
some
time
and
left
a
bit
of
lacing
lemon
peel
and
coriander
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
grain
flavor
is
lemon
orange
and
coriander
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
decently
long
finish
its
been
a
while
since
i
have
had
this
beer
and
i
especially
since
i
have
thought
about
it
critically
while
i
drank
it
it
has
long
been
a
camping
pool
beer
for
me
and
i
am
usually
not
taking
notes
in
the
pool
when
i
look
back
on
my
initial
review
i
was
definitely
a
little
green
at
that
point
reviewing
a
beer
straight
from
the
can
but
my
overall
feelings
havent
changed
much
this
is
a
solid
example
of
the
style
if
a
bit
one
note
it
is
also
a
beer
that
i
would
happily
take
on
any
outdoor
pursuit
where
beer
is
desired
overall
drinkability
a
great
postyardwork
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
i
think
it
would
go
well
with
food
as
well
interestingly
one
is
all
i
want
right
now
its
good
but
it
leaves
me
not
wanting
more
im
somewhere
between
pleasantly
sated
and
thinking
umm
no
more
right
now
maybe
later
definitely
above
average
but
i
cant
exactly
call
it
good
in
the
end
overall
though
nice
looking
beer
with
a
good
simple
taste
not
an
amazing
witbier
but
a
good
one
the
mouthfeel
okay
it
had
the
sizzle
of
a
wit
but
in
the
end
i
dumped
out
the
last
quarter
of
the
glass
o
i
was
obsessed
with
this
beer
when
i
first
started
drinking
belgium
and
craft
beers
after
not
having
this
for
awhile
im
not
blown
away
like
i
was
when
i
first
had
it
however
this
is
a
good
drinkable
beer
and
really
good
on
a
warm
day

its

as
it
should
be
this
drinks
very
well
cold
and
fairly
ok
warm
but
hits
its
peak
served
very
cold
most
white
beers
often
require
additional
citrus
slices
to
balance
out
the
beer
and
make
it
what
it
should
be
think
shocktop
or
blue
moon
but
the
blend
of
ingredients
with
this
beer
doesnt
need
any
doctoring
it
goes
down
smooth
with
a
solid
citrus
and
coriander
taste
offering
a
consistent
little
bite
in
the
back
corners
of
the
tongue
and
mouth
the
carbonation
is
mild
enough
to
drink
heartily
but
the
taste
and
mouth
feel
want
you
to
slow
down
and
savor
such
a
quality
drink
this
is
a
great
beer
for
those
with
a
domestic
palate
bud
coors
etc
who
are
searching
for
a
foreign
high
quality
white
zesty
beer
made
the
right
way
there
is
no
need
to
add
anything
to
this
wellbalanced
high
quality
witte
beer
i
quite
like
how
the
various
usual
witbier
suspects
are
so
well
blended
in
this
offering
equally
detectable
yes
but
better
when
appreciated
in
context
with
the
others
the
burgeoning
summerlike
weather
would
seem
to
cry
out
for
this
kind
of
beverage
i
would
agree
with
the
caveat
that
this
particular
one
could
be
enjoyed
yearround
appearance
is
a
yellow
tone
with
cloudiness
the
smell
is
citrus
primarily
lemon
wheat
too
a
faint
aroma
in
general
it
tastes
of
corn
orange
some
light
spices
mf
is
light
and
clean
finishes
dry
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
wit
and
a
good
option
to
have
a
couple
of
while
doing
a
spring
clean

great
witbier
coming

try
it
with

overall
not
bad
but
i
have
had
better
not
sure
of
some
of
the
lower
reviews
comparing
this
to
sprite
or
michelob
ultra
definitely
had
more
body
than
those
lackluster
beverages
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
worth
trying
o
a
good
beer
in
this
style
overall
i
cannot
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
even
if
you
love
a
good
wit
bier
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
no
doubt
for
being
so
light
it
has
a
deep
flavor
and
aroma
profile
it
has
a
reserved
but
well
blended
profile
all
the
way
around
i
do
have
to
comment
that
while
i
am
warming
up
to
can
beer
in
general
in
this
case
the
can
makes
it
hard
to
get
a
good
belgian
pour
of
your
beer
so
it
ends
coming
out
sloppy
so
that
you
break
the
tension
in
the
beer
and
it
will
flow
the
first
two
i
poured
i
tried
to
pour
too
slowly
so
it
ran
back
the
side
of
the
beer
and
spilled
all
over
the
place
i
am
thinking
that
the
bottle
or
draft
may
be
a
different
experience
so
i
will
plan
to
try
those
too
if
presented
the
opportunity
overall
i
really
like
the
flavorings
of
this
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
belgian
beers
not
so
much
on
wheats
but
this
one
is
very
good
light
easy
drinker
and
great
for
a
spring
summer
patio
evening
beer
highly
recommend
o
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
and
it
holds
up
with
the
best
in
the
style
overall
i
guess
that
i
expected
more
but
i
still
enjoyed
the
beer
and
if
given
the
chance
to
pick
up
some
bottles
i
would
the
color
is
weird
almost
green
in
the
glass
cloudy
as
all
hell
but
ill
drink
anything
the
second
one
i
drank
much
warmer
and
it
had
more
flavor
but
still
well
balanced
and
light
good
and
interesting
though
certainly
not
my
favorite
witbier
i
would
like
some
more
citrus
especially
orange
character
and
the
funk
throws
me
off
a
little
bit
drinkability
enjoyed
two
back
to
back
had
a
buffalo
chicken
wrap
and
chips
w
guacamole
with
my
second
can
reminds
of
of
days
when
i
used
to
live
in
wien
austria
a
great
memory
bier
d
i
have
to
say
i
expected
a
little
more
flavor
and
body
from
this
one
not
what
i
expect
from
witbiers
having
said
that
i
still
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
alot
its
an
easy
sessionable
beer
and
one
i
would
love
for
the
river
in
summertime
like
i
said
not
my
idea
of
witbier
but
an
easy
drinker
nonetheless
d
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
this
beer
would
be
a
great
refresher
on
a
hot
summer
day
both
drinkable
and
flavorful
pours
a
hazy
dull

solid
amounts

lemon
seltzer
water
bananas
and
lightly
toasted
malts
upfront
basic
biscuity
malts
light
character
overall
but
in
all
honesty
i
could
drink
a
fair
amount
of
this
an
effervescent
light
witbier
medium
finish
toasty
malts
light
banana
a
touch
of
light
spiciness
d
the
beer
is
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
has
some
refreshing
qualities
d
drinkable
not
overly
carbonated
goes
down
easy
although
tastes
a
little
thin
would
benefit
from
a
twist
of
orange
hey
its
a
beer
thats
about
the
extent
of
my
enthusiasm
for
this
beer
and
what
it
gives
to
you
too
i
wish
i
had
checked
with
ba
ratings
before
trying
this
i
would
have
passed
on
the
chance
wouldnt
mind
my
2
back
misses
some
of
the
key
aspects
of
the
wit
style
probably
the
blandest
belgian
beer
from
belgium
that
ive
tasted
and
thats
not
a
compliment
a
disappointment
this
is
really
missing
some
of
the
pleasant
lilting
spice
and
the
round
mellow
characters
you
can
get
with
a
witbier
its
light
and
drinkable
enough
but
it
also
feels
very
flat
not
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
can
drink
this
easy
enough
without
noticing
it
its
nto
good
but
its
not
like
i
hate
it
d
as
stated
above
ive
had
this
before
and
dont
remember
it
like
this
maybe
it
is
because
it
is
in
a
bottle
couldnt
locate
a
freshness
date
but
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
it
drinkability
a
very
pleasing
brew
this
is
a
very
solid
wheat
beer
with
a
nice
easy
flavor
very
smooth
and
light
in
your
mouth
i
could
have
had
a
few
more
of
these
and
would
have
if
they
werent
6
50
definitely
a
good
beer
though
and
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
definitely
a
summer
quencher
or
thirst
slaker
easy
going
and
approachable
but
quite
average
in
all
respects
notes
i
sure
can
see
how
this
could
fit
in
certain
settings
and
surely
i
would
take
it
ahead
of
a
macro
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
it
in
any
case
the
beer
pours
out
of
the
can
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
slight
smell
of
citrusy
wheat
maybe
lemon
grass
crisp
beer
with
a
tastey
citrus
wheat
and
some
yeast
this
is
a
light
beer
and
very
drinkable
but
its
light
on
flavor
and
eveything
else
drinkability
i
would
not
be
suffering
to
sit
and
drink
these
but
it
would
not
be
by
my
choosing
in
the
future
d
these
are
easy
to
drink
on
hot
summer
days
i
could
see
this
as
being
a
lawnmower
beer
i
would
have
this
again
drinkability
yes
you
could
pound
these
all
day
but
what
the
point
poured
this
from
a
can
to
a
very
hazy
pale
yellow
not
much
head
to
speak
of
but
what
was
there
was
white
lots
of
lemon
in
the
scent
along
with
a
bit
of
yeasty
clove
not
a
whole
heck
of
a
lot
of
taste
here
lemon
is
very
faint
the
spiciness
shows
itself
here
more
than
in
the
scent
theres
definitely
clove
and
coriander
theres
a
hint
of
pepper
on
the
back
end
as
well
refreshing
feel
as
it
makes
its
way
down
your
throat
id
have
it
again
but
there
are
certainly
other
beers
i
more
enjoy
in
the
style
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
half
inch
of
white
head
that
settled
to
a
thin
cap
this
beer
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
there
are
plenty
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
yeast
the
taste
is
some
more
of
that
spicy
yeast
but
not
much
else
its
pretty
bland
tasting
im
not
getting
the
typical
orange
and
coriander
it
has
a
bite
from
the
carbonation
it
goes
down
easy
but
it
is
nothing
special
this
is
a
nice
citrusy
refreshing
brew
d
again
delicious
i
totally
dig
this
wit
and
it
would
benefit
as
an
accompaniment
to
a
meal
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
bunch
of
them
based
on
how
smooth
it
is
but
with
a
lack
of
taste
it
really
doesnt
leave
me
wanting
more
overall
an
average
witbier
with
nothing
really
outstanding
worth
a
try
especially
in
the
summer
wit
looks
like
a
typical
wit
in
that
it
has
a
hazy
orangish
yellow
look
with
some
chunksdebris
floating
within
the
drink
especially
when
the
dregs
are
poured
in
nice
sheets
of
lacing
smells
like
a
wit
in
that
i
get
wheat
pale
malts
and
some
underlining
spices
in
taste
the
wheat
is
more
pronounced
than
the
orange
and
coriander
pale
malts
are
not
to
shabby
either
a
simple
drink
in
a
can
no
less
feel
is
light
bodied
with
a
ample
carb
i
liked
it
but
not
enough
to
go
for
it
again
ill
just
stick
to
my
allagash
white
d
nice
and
tasty
not
a
real
standout
of
for
as
far
as
the
style
goes
but
enjoyable
all
the
same
conclusion
i
was
looking
through
my
reviews
the
other
day
saw
how
low
id
rated
this
beer
the
one
other
time
i
had
the
canned
version
and
figured
something
must
have
been
wrong
wthat
can
so
i
deleted
the
review
and
gave
it
another
shot
nope
its
just
pretty
bad
and
this
one
is
well
within
date
too
so
my
friend
and
i
used
to
drink
the
wittekerke
bottles
all
the
time
and
loved
it
it
was
my
first
belgian
white
that
wasnt
a
blue
moon
i
dunno
whats
happened
since
then
or
maybe
my
tastes
have
just
changed
that
dramatically
at
any
rate
pass
this
one
on
by
drinkability
this
beer
isnt
spiced
the
way
im
used
to
witbiers
being
and
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
normal
refreshment
factor
for
me
still
its
not
too
bad
and
is
relatively
drinkable
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
and
not
much
else
the
taste
of
wheat
with
a
hint
of
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
witbier
at
best
i
dont
think
i
would
drink
it
again
mouthfeel
was
the
winner
here
overall
this
wasnt
the
most
flavorful
wit
in
the
world
but
its
real
easy
to
drink
and
is
more
refreshing
than
most
worth
a
shot
d
nice
little
summertime
session
beer
drinkabilitly
summer
brew
of
course
that
would
go
down
very
easy
on
those
hot
days
completely
lacking
the
body
and
spicy
flavor
i
expect
from
a
witbier
this
ends
up
resembling
an
american
light
lager
in
its
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
although
its
thin
enough
for
heavy
consumption
i
cant
imagine
anyone
wanting
to
drink
something
that
is
so
unappealing
and
uninspired
o
ive
heard
alot
of
people
say
good
things
but
this
was
not
my
draft
of
beer
i
couldnt
pull
any
malt
sweetness
out
of
and
quite
frankly
tasted
like
adjunct
lager
i
would
have
liked
more
malt
character
fruity
and
spicy
notes
out
of
this
one
the
appearance
however
was
spot
on
just
not
aroma
or
taste
if
you
are
looking
for
a
belgian
wit
beer
i
can
think
of
several
better
versions
including
some
american
brewed
clones
d
this
beer
is
an
outright
embarrassment
this
would
make
a
great
entry
beer
for
those
who
are
scared
to
stray
from
their
mass
produced
watery
american
pilsners
lagers
a
nice
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
andor
a
nice
match
for
an
italian
or
greek
salad
drinkability
is
excellent
i
could
easily
see
having
two
or
three
in
a
night
i
tried
this
beer
on
may
21
2009
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
yellow
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
was
a
conconction
of
wheat
malt
some
banana
and
some
peppery
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
and
the
flavour
was
grainy
wheat
and
some
spicy
bitterness
to
finish
off
d
different
but
overall
its
less
than
average
i
cant
get
into
it
swirl
poured
into
a
glass
beaker
hazy
amber
with
a
two
finger
fluffy
white
head
which
soon
flattened
to
thin
layer
strong
lacing
smells
lemony
citrus
up
front
with
some
complex
spiciness
going
on
the
taste
is
surprisingly
mild
citrus
less
apparent
but
there
is
a
pleasant
spicy
blend
very
nice
mouthfeel
the
fine
carbonation
blends
nicely
with
the
spice
flavours
perking
up
a
fairly
light
drink
drinkability
is
high
for
a
very
drinkable
style
bring
on
summer
future
outlook
very
pleasant
if
unspectacular
beer
who
knows
i
wont
seek
it
out
but
it
could
end
up
back
in
the
fridge
someday
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
without
knowing
it
which
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
d
overall
refreshing
but
doesnt
live
up
to
what
a
witbier
can
be
rather
disappointed
but
at
least
its
easy
to
drink
if
i
had
to
do
it
over
again
i
think
i
would
pass
this
one
over
and
get
something
else
d
considered
drinkable
because
its
so
light
and
airy
yet
not
too
enjoyable
read
a
few
reviews
describing
this
as
a
wheat
light
and
there
really
isnt
much
more
to
say
beyond
that
this
stuff
is
really
easy
to
drink
no
offensive
flavors
and
very
well
hidden
alcohol
i
only
bought
one
but
could
have
easily
finished
off
a
six
pack
of
these
drinkability
with
this
flavor
i
dont
really
want
another
one
for
lemon
lovers
this
could
be
worth
a
try
but
its
not
my
thing
serving
type
can
d
a
tad
sweeter
than
most
wits
and
a
good
flavour
i
quite
liked
this
one
i
havent
had
it
in
the
longest
time
i
was
glad
to
revisit
it
d
very
good
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
would
prefer
to
try
it
in
a
bottle
to
see
if
its
any
different
flavor
is
spicy
lemon
rinds
with
quite
a
bit
of
cloves
and
licorice
wheat
graininess
is
there
aplenty
but
it
seems
to
be
missing
the
creamy
body
and
mild
sweetness
found
in
many
witbiers
drinkability
is
high
and
would
be
easy
to
kill
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
not
bad
but
it
is
hard
to
pick
this
over
a
hoegaarden
at
roughly
the
same
price
point
per
sixer
still
a
fun
beer
to
try
though
and
would
make
a
good
canned
choice
for
a
beer
to
float
the
river
or
chillin
on
a
beach
d
because
i
cant
seem
to
shake
the
feeling
that
i
think
im
drinking
tequiza
this
one
isnt
a
brew
i
would
revisit
over
and
over
again
for
a
once
in
a
while
thirst
quencher
perhaps
but
not
in
the
top
ten
of
witbiers
that
ive
had
d
overall
it
is
refreshing
but
to
me
does
not
live
up
to
what
a
witbier
can
be
rather
disappointed
i
must
say
but
at
least
its
easy
to
drink
if
i
had
to
do
it
over
again
i
think
i
would
pass
this
one
over
and
get
something
else
overall
pretty
good
for
style
but
a
bit
too
fruity
and
not
quite
enough
of
a
yeastywheaty
bite
that
i
would
like
for
a
wit
still
quite
tasty
and
a
great
summer
beer
that
i
may
bring
to
bonnaroo
with
me
this
year
this
is
an
ideal
session
beer
for
beer
enthusiasts
belgian
beer
pong
anyone
drinkability
its
not
like
i
had
to
choke
this
down
or
anything
it
was
a
decent
beer
but
in
all
honesty
i
wouldnt
bother
with
it
there
are
other
examples
of
this
style
that
are
readily
available
and
superior
o
a
metallic
mess
avoid
at
all
costs
in
the
steel
can
it
pours
with
an
out
of
control
head
that
almost
spills
out
of
the
glass
crazy
looking
carbonation
bubbles
mixing
with
the
yeast
creates
an
amusing
visual
when
waiting
for
the
head
to
shrink
color
is
foggy
yellow
the
smell
is
a
bit
floral
and
a
little
sour
there
is
also
a
hint
of
fruity
yeast
taste
begins
with
a
fruity
yeasty
taste
that
leads
to
a
mild
sourness
the
finish
is
quite
yeasty
the
carbonation
was
a
little
excessive
in
the
beginning
but
went
on
the
flatter
side
quite
quickly
overall
an
ok
witt
that
was
quite
reasonably
priced
not
the
best
witt
but
a
very
drinkable
average
witt
as
far
as
taste
goes
i
enjoyed
it
but
then
again
i
love
witbiers
the
body
is
light
but
smooth
the
flavors
are
rounded
subtle
complex
at
first
it
seems
dry
and
spicy
however
the
more
the
beer
explores
the
palate
a
creamy
sweetness
reveals
itself
wonderful
in
appearance
pours
a
very
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
fluffy
white
head
rather
light
aroma
some
faint
spice
and
lemon
skin
light
in
body
a
bit
sharp
around
the
edges
well
carbonated
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
a
value
belgian
wit
for
sure
had
on
tap
at
capital
alehouse
in
richmond
very
pale
very
cloudy
yellow
with
about
34
inch
white
head
the
smell
was
fairly
weak
and
breadier
than
i
was
expecting
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
i
could
sit
and
drink
these
nonstop
the
taste
was
wheaty
almost
to
the
point
where
it
was
more
like
a
hefe
weizen
than
a
witbier
there
was
a
very
strong
citrus
taste
toward
on
the
finish
that
got
stronger
as
the
beer
warmed
nice
balanced
carbonation
the
mouthful
and
drinkability
were
both
great
again
i
could
sit
and
drink
these
all
day
value
i
paid
1
59
for
a
can
as
a
trial
beer
its
worth
that
price
ive
seen
it
in
six
packs
for
around
8
50
and
at
that
price
id
say
its
a
decent
value
but
not
great
i
have
to
wonder
if
id
ever
choose
this
over
a
decent
hefewiezen
priced
at
a
buck
and
a
half
less
i
doubt
it
pours
a
super
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
strongly
of
a
belgian
yeast
strain
taste
is
very
light
and
grainy
up
front
but
the
middle
and
finish
have
nice
belgian
yeast
esters
very
little
spices
though
mouthfeel
is
good
nice
low
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
light
and
refreshing
overall
a
nice
beer
though
a
touch
bland
d
not
the
best
witbier
out
there
but
i
could
see
drinking
a
couple
of
them
light
bleached
blonde
the
whitest
cloudy
white
ale
ive
ever
seen
smooth
creamy
white
head
that
leves
plenty
of
fine
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
orange
candy
wheat
malt
vanilla
and
coriander
the
flavors
are
milder
than
the
nose
suggests
but
the
same
orange
peel
belgian
spice
and
wheat
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
for
the
style
and
highly
carbonated
with
a
slight
asprin
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
nice
beer
but
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
best
of
the
style
picked
up
a
single
at
php
in
brookline
poured
into
an
ommegang
witte
glass
very
carbonated
you
can
hear
the
head
crackling
like
rice
krispies
hazy
yellow
color
average
smell
faintly
grassy
taste
was
just
slightly
above
average
had
some
nice
coriander
and
lemon
taste
but
it
was
very
muted
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
a
bit
soapy
easy
to
drink
smooth
and
low
abv
makes
it
goes
down
without
thinking
not
much
to
this
beer
just
kind
of
a
run
of
the
mill
witbier
that
quenches
the
thirst
but
doesnt
blow
me
away
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
golden
with
less
than
a
finger
of
white
head
the
smell
was
one
of
lemon
orange
and
feint
allspice
the
taste
was
more
intense
with
the
spiciness
surprisingly
more
prominent
than
the
citrus
spritzy
medium
body
a
nicely
spicy
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
but
highly
drinkable
pours
hazy
opaque
yellow
with
a
good
size
creamy
white
head
good
looking
lace
typical
witbier
spice
and
yeast
smells
light
wheat
flavor
enough
spiciness
to
give
a
little
boost
clean
and
simple
taste
smooth
slightly
creamy
mouthfeel
good
all
around
example
this
isnt
too
bad
but
its
a
bit
too
bland
the
flavor
is
quite
good
and
its
very
clean
so
if
it
had
just
a
bit
more
to
it
i
think
itd
be
a
very
good
wit
not
too
bad
and
pretty
drinkable
but
left
me
wanting
something
a
bit
more
poured
from
a
brown
11
2oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
and
lots
of
floating
yeast
smell
is
a
bit
sweet
with
some
spices
taste
is
of
citrus
and
spice
pretty
good
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
easily
overall
this
is
a
quality
beer
not
the
best
from
bavik
hate
it
or
love
it
but
its
a
really
cheap
wit
from
the
11
2
fl
oz
bottle
no
39701
sampled
on
september
26
2009
it
pours
straw
yellowwhite
with
a
thick
puffy
white
head
and
extremely
cloudy
the
aroma
has
a
rich
sweetness
about
it
as
well
as
the
wheat
that
i
have
come
to
expect
from
a
belgian
wheat
what
i
did
not
expect
was
how
sweet
the
taste
would
be
it
was
almost
like
drinking
sugar
that
was
a
bit
offputting
a
background
of
hops
in
there
too
something
to
drink
with
chips
i
suppose
the
mouthfeel
is
delightfully
crisp
and
light
but
not
watery
at
all
as
such
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
utterly
refreshing
i
was
in
the
mood
for
a
wit
and
didnt
feel
like
hoegaarden
blue
moon
or
shocktop
and
i
didnt
want
to
fork
over
the
extra
cash
for
allagash
or
bernardus
my
hopes
were
a
bit
low
for
this
one
but
i
ended
up
being
pleasantly
surprised
one
of
the
great
warmweather
beers
but
enjoyable
year
round
d
its
certainly
unique
id
never
make
it
my
goto
wit
but
it
is
good
and
refreshing
very
good
beer
overall
similar
but
slightly
more
flavorful
and
refreshing
than
macro
interpretations
of
the
style
for
instance
this
compares
well
to
blue
moon
and
makes
a
great
picnic
beer
if
you
pick
up
the
canned
version
notes
nice
to
find
in
a
can
this
one
is
worth
finding
i
had
it
at
the
cafe
intermezzo
in
dunwoody
ga
drinkability
yes
it
is
overall
this
brew
is
drinkable
but
not
one
i
will
try
again
overall
both
the
bottle
and
can
were
good
examples
of
the
style
the
can
seemed
a
little
lighter
than
the
bottle
i
can
see
taking
cans
to
the
beachgolf
coursetailgate
when
bottles
arent
allowed
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
pretty
poor
witbier
overall
wouldnt
recommend
it
when
there
are
much
better
options
d
not
a
perfect
witbier
but
a
pretty
good
one
all
things
considered
i
really
liked
the
yeasty
character
and
only
wish
the
carbonation
level
was
more
to
my
liking
for
this
style
all
in
all
a
very
sessionable
beer
though
drinkability
a
very
balanced
beer
was
in
my
glass
and
is
now
in
my
tummy
it
was
refreshing
bold
for
its
style
and
full
of
wonderful
flavor
although
it
was
a
tiny
bit
watery
it
was
complex
and
refreshing
enough
to
keep
my
full
attention
great
brew
ill
have
another
d
true
to
form
refreshing
has
a
decent
body
feel
leaving
one
as
though
they
did
drink
a
beer
and
not
some
light
colored
concoction
id
have
another
drinkability
is
fairly
high
because
it
isnt
hard
to
choke
down
thats
as
far
as
ill
recommend
it
though
because
there
are
far
better
for
style
drinkability
a
real
snoozer
so
filtered
and
meek
its
downright
wimpy
im
all
for
light
and
refreshing
but
come
on
lets
have
some
any
flavor
too
overall
a
decent
beer
smell
is
of
light
crisp
malt
bread
yeasty
banana
and
mysterious
hops
its
a
little
thin
smelling
and
just
feels
like
something
is
missing
taste
is
light
and
thin
although
there
is
a
crisp
breadiness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
alright
drinkability
this
beer
goes
down
extremely
effortlessly
because
of
its
lack
of
body
flavor
and
any
other
harsh
impediment
i
wouldnt
revisit
d
epitome
of
drinkability
light
and
decently
flavorful
but
good
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
that
whitish
tinge
that
wit
biers
have
small
but
tight
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
ring
some
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
lemon
and
hints
of
coriander
grainy
on
the
taste
with
a
wheat
malt
crisp
edge
some
lemon
and
coriander
pretty
bland
for
a
wit
the
feel
is
light
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
with
a
grainy
sweetness
drinks
real
easy
good
for
drinking
in
the
sun
the
bier
is
just
about
average
in
all
aspects
no
real
bold
wit
flavors
they
seem
to
sit
in
the
background
the
grainy
flavor
seems
to
be
forefront
while
making
the
beer
easy
to
drink
it
seems
to
stray
from
the
style
perhaps
a
can
is
not
the
best
vessel
for
this
beer
id
never
heard
of
this
brew
before
ordering
it
and
by
the
flavor
couldve
sworn
it
was
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
in
such
a
case
it
wouldve
been
one
of
the
best
apwas
ive
tasted
nonetheless
its
a
good
option
for
thirstquencher
on
a
hot
day
and
complexity
is
enough
to
not
be
too
boring
compliment
you
decide
d
satisfying
and
easy
drinking
i
do
want
another
despite
not
being
blown
away
or
impressed
even
im
not
planning
on
buying
another
sixer
again
readily
in
the
near
future
not
bad
a
standard
witbier
that
feels
solid
but
a
bit
bland
otherwise
you
could
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
mouthfeel
is
like
a
regular
wit
refreshing
but
the
taste
is
bland
so
i
cant
highly
recommend
this
one
its
not
bad
but
its
unmemorable
taste
mouthfeel
tastes
like
a
lemon
butter
cookie
with
white
pepper
on
it
even
for
the
style
this
is
rather
bland
oddly
buttery
and
lacking
the
dry
crisp
finish
i
look
for
in
a
good
wit
not
awful
by
any
means
this
would
be
a
solid
picnic
beer
its
just
decidedly
average
pours
a
opaque
light
yellow
with
almost
no
head
there
is
no
lacing
on
this
glass
from
the
small
head
it
has
a
lemonorange
smell
with
some
spices
there
is
also
a
hint
of
sour
apple
in
the
smell
it
tastes
a
bit
like
apple
juice
with
some
hints
of
citrus
in
the
backgroundits
very
sweet
it
is
very
drinkable
for
the
style
but
it
is
thin
and
a
light
carbonation
sorry
not
impressed
with
this
beer
at
all
d
not
bad
to
drink
but
pretty
much
a
one
dimensional
beer
this
isnt
one
of
the
witbiers
id
run
to
but
it
wouldnt
be
hard
to
drink
md
fresh
on
the
palete
with
nothing
offensive
at
all
mild
wheats
and
malts
have
a
mild
astringent
feel
on
the
mouth
highly
drinkable
belgian
wheat
beer
not
my
first
or
last
d
drinkability
is
good
but
i
wasnt
really
wanting
another
by
the
time
i
was
done
d
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
great
lawnmower
summer
beer
the
taste
is
dryish
witbier
again
with
a
good
pale
lager
element
grain
but
fruity
with
grass
hints
of
lemon
juice
and
grapefruit
dry
light
freshly
squeezed
grapefruit
juice
not
the
usual
grapefruit
i
note
in
many
us
micros
and
pear
juice
without
the
sweetness
it
has
a
lightly
bittertart
finish
and
is
rather
dy
its
a
bit
thin
but
tasty
a
chunky
pour
gives
us
a
large
pure
whit
head
which
quickly
reduces
to
a
moderate
covering
with
little
lacing
to
speak
of
color
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
aroma
is
filled
with
light
fruits
coriander
and
sweet
bread
taste
involves
more
coriander
though
a
bit
more
subtle
than
the
smell
yeast
more
light
fruits
oranges
grapefruit
and
a
hint
of
sour
grapes
in
the
back
very
highly
drinkable
despite
its
medium
body
and
relative
thickness
pours
a
slightly
hazy
very
pale
straw
color
with
a
bit
over
a
finger
of
moussy
head
that
exhibits
decent
retention
aroma
is
pleasant
although
a
touch
subdued
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
complexity
here
but
it
is
in
no
way
overwhelming
there
is
some
spicy
wheat
coriander
some
light
pepper
and
a
moderate
zesty
orange
fruitiness
taste
is
pretty
good
a
grainy
at
times
spicy
wheat
flavor
is
present
throughout
the
zesty
orange
citrus
flavor
is
a
bit
more
dominant
here
that
in
the
aroma
the
coriander
is
fairly
subdued
hop
bitterness
is
very
low
the
finish
is
fairly
dry
and
a
bit
tart
mouthfeel
is
ok
mediumlight
in
body
with
moderatehigh
carbonation
slightly
creamy
drinkaiblity
is
pretty
good
i
enjoyed
this
brew
but
i
dont
find
myself
immediately
reaching
for
another
its
a
fine
beer
to
drink
out
of
a
can
on
a
hot
day
or
after
a
great
day
of
skiing
or
riding
overall
this
is
a
decent
wit
stil
would
rather
pick
up
a
hoegaarden
over
this
but
the
price
is
a
cheaper
so
it
may
when
out
when
im
in
the
mood
d
good
session
beer
wont
wow
you
but
conveniently
packaged
in
cans
for
easy
transport
ok
quencher
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
light
conversation
m
very
clean
and
smooth
light
carbonation
ah
the
anticipation
this
fine
belgian
hard
to
go
wrong
with
belgian
beers
though
pours
white
and
very
murkycloudy
with
a
thick
head
and
sweet
nose
the
taste
is
sweet
and
steady
with
light
citrus
and
floral
notes
quite
pleasant
and
very
much
what
youd
expect
from
a
belgian
witte
wheat
beer
and
its
far
better
than
blue
moon
wittekerke
is
nice
nothing
over
the
top
just
a
simple
citrusy
brew
i
envision
this
as
a
sunny
afternoon
porch
sipping
beer
or
even
dare
i
say
it
a
brunch
beer
if
you
are
a
wit
fan
give
it
a
try
if
youve
had
bruexelles
blanche
wittekerke
is
very
similar
and
a
bit
of
a
bargain
with
a
6pack
of
wittekerke
cans
running
about
the
same
as
a
4pack
of
bruexelles
bottles
d
this
beer
is
supremely
drinkable
and
absolutely
refreshing
sure
its
not
going
to
win
any
extreme
beer
contests
or
even
the
coveted
best
witbier
in
the
world
according
to
ba
spot
but
given
the
two
different
goals
that
can
amicably
exist
within
this
style
easy
refreshment
and
complex
spiciness
e
g
allagash
white
this
one
excels
at
the
former
d
tastes
not
too
unique
but
its
definitally
refreshing
enough
to
drink
a
lot
in
the
summer
i
actually
enjoy
this
beer
quite
a
bit
despite
the
lack
of
taste
i
got
a
finger
of
soapy
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
off
of
my
pour
the
color
was
a
hazy
lemonyellow
like
freshsqueezed
grapefruit
juice
the
nose
was
both
musty
and
fruity
like
bubble
gum
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
candylike
fruitiness
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
slightly
dry
and
highly
refreshing
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
poured
into
my
sa
summer
ale
glass
pours
a
nice
white
head
that
recedes
into
a
alright
lacing
the
color
is
light
yellow
with
a
cloudy
haze
the
smell
is
of
light
somwhat
fruity
taste
is
has
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
then
finishes
a
bit
too
sharp
and
dry
but
not
too
bad
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
fairly
light
with
decent
carbination
overall
not
a
bad
beer
good
to
have
one
of
these
just
relaxing
in
the
afternoon
or
to
take
to
the
beach
because
of
getting
it
in
a
can
creamy
mouthfeel
sits
well
on
the
palate
very
drinkable
the
aluminum
taste
goes
away
after
awhile
a
sixer
in
the
summer
cant
be
bad
though
there
are
much
better
witbiers
out
the
like
alagash
bottle
pours
a
pale
blonde
small
white
head
not
a
well
done
wit
in
my
opinion
aroma
and
taste
were
dominated
by
a
vegetable
smelltaste
and
yeast
sorta
like
celery
or
the
like
not
to
my
liking
when
drinking
a
wit
wont
be
trying
this
one
again
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
easily
have
killed
the
six
pack
watching
a
football
game
very
light
reminds
me
of
a
nice
summer
afternoon
brightly
glowing
yellow
color
in
spite
of
the
thick
cloudiness
good
froth
on
the
pour
which
sticks
around
hard
to
see
the
bubbles
light
and
crisp
nose
of
lemon
oats
barley
and
bitters
just
smells
like
its
very
dry
fullbodied
even
as
the
flavors
and
general
mouth
feel
are
at
first
more
linear
and
crisp
lemon
again
most
present
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
mouth
breaks
up
a
good
deal
of
the
denser
malt
barley
and
oat
flavors
starts
off
dry
and
gets
sweeter
as
you
swallow
some
mixed
asian
spices
lots
of
aftertaste
this
helped
by
the
big
body
slightly
tiring
not
sure
i
could
pound
a
sixpack
ill
pass
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
looks
lighter
than
your
average
wit
beer
but
plenty
cloudy
i
am
trying
hard
but
dont
get
anything
specific
from
the
nose
aside
from
a
funky
twang
oh
wow
twang
present
in
the
taste
almost
lagerish
if
you
ask
me
not
a
wit
that
i
will
likely
try
again
the
taste
is
quite
subdued
and
watery
a
bit
sharp
in
places
there
is
an
undefined
spiciness
in
the
beer
which
is
slight
and
hard
to
pin
down
it
might
be
some
watered
down
vague
coriander
there
is
also
a
lemony
zest
to
the
beer
maybe
a
touch
of
orange
as
well
the
beer
is
quite
yeasty
with
average
carbonation
there
is
a
cardboard
flatness
quality
in
the
taste
this
is
a
decent
but
by
no
means
stellar
witbier
and
maybe
a
tad
disappointing
given
its
origin
the
consistency
is
light
to
medium
bodied
a
bit
more
substantial
than
other
witbiers
but
the
taste
is
just
too
lacking
in
character
to
rate
this
beer
much
above
average
refreshing
yes
tasty
and
interesting
well
not
really
while
a
bitout
of
season
i
became
the
happy
recipient
of
a
6pack
of
wittekerke
belgian
wheat
with
proper
wittepint
at
hand
the
bottle
poured
a
nice
yeastcloudy
pale
yellow
leaving
a
full
fluffy
white
head
that
thinned
a
bit
as
some
clarity
moved
from
bottom
up
the
head
maintained
a
nice
lacey
retention
the
overall
appearance
lept
its
cloudy
color
the
aroma
offered
up
a
floral
lemon
zest
with
a
hint
of
spice
the
flavor
was
an
upliftingly
sweet
but
not
too
syrupy
lemon
wheatmalt
with
a
bit
of
hops
in
a
bubbly
carbonation
that
stuck
around
as
with
all
wheats
no
additional
lemon
wedge
need
apply
you
dont
add
a
potato
wedge
to
a
stout
do
you
this
was
a
highly
drinkable
great
summertime
refreshing
replacement
to
the
blue
moons
out
there
not
my
favorite
witte
but
definitely
delicious
poured
this
milky
yellowish
white
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
gave
a
good
amount
of
head
which
reduces
down
to
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
of
citrus
and
a
malty
wit
beer
greet
the
nose
however
the
taste
is
lemon
with
a
bit
of
malts
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
with
friends
while
chilling
out
after
a
warm
day
verdict
for
the
price
and
cleanliness
ill
be
buying
this
again
better
and
cheaper
than
blue
moon
thats
for
sure
a
belgian
wit
out
of
a
can
nice
pours
a
hazy
pineapple
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
average
lacing
nice
spicy
coriander
aroma
wheat
twang
somewhat
sweet
flavor
has
some
nice
citrus
flavor
a
bit
of
orange
nice
malted
and
unmalted
wheat
flavor
spicy
coriander
again
light
sweetness
creamy
on
the
tongue
carbonation
on
the
lighter
side
light
to
medium
bodied
is
this
beer
really
this
good
its
half
the
price
of
hoegaarden
but
twice
as
tasty
a
very
solid
low
abv
wit
thats
the
very
definition
of
sessionable
good
stuff
it
has
a
pale
blonde
cloudy
and
hazy
body
it
had
a
huge
amount
of
head
that
would
later
form
a
very
tight
lace
it
has
a
sweet
beany
wheat
aroma
it
has
very
sweet
and
slight
citric
bitterness
there
are
little
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
is
a
very
smooth
beer
there
is
no
really
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
but
that
is
what
makes
this
beer
so
good
what
flavor
it
does
have
makes
it
very
neutral
and
refreshing
beer
pretty
smoothe
feeling
beer
that
doesnt
dry
the
palate
out
but
still
calls
you
on
to
drink
more
better
than
alot
of
other
belgian
whitesjust
not
as
good
as
st
bernardous
very
interesting
witbier
from
a
can
this
is
a
borderline
good
beer
only
because
of
portability
and
that
its
interesting
as
an
imported
canned
wit
id
like
to
try
it
on
draft
somewhere
and
see
if
i
get
a
different
nose
and
flavor
out
of
it
could
have
been
the
can
the
color
was
the
same
hazy
light
lemon
yellow
with
no
foam
or
lace
to
speak
of
the
smell
of
sour
lemon
was
very
evident
as
was
the
taste
sour
lemon
was
very
pleasant
to
the
palate
if
you
like
sour
lemons
youll
like
this
beer
not
me
i
scored
it
higher
than
i
should
of
compare
to
the
can
version
not
a
beer
i
will
buy
again
decent
and
standard
good
summer
brew
a
one
dimensional
beer
but
i
dig
the
can
better
wits
for
sure
but
nothing
worth
avoiding
in
this
one
again
i
think
something
may
have
happened
to
this
bottle
or
batch
ive
had
it
before
and
its
better
than
this
it
looks
like
a
nice
opaque
pear
juice
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
got
some
lil
white
floaties
in
my
glass
too
decent
lacing
the
nose
is
coriander
sweet
orange
zest
very
floral
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
nose
but
with
some
mellow
lemons
in
the
mix
its
a
very
mellow
brew
i
dig
it
medium
body
low
carbo
very
enjoyable
overall
a
solid
wit
a
little
too
sweet
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
for
canned
beer
d
this
is
an
ideal
session
beer
and
one
that
i
truly
enjoy
having
on
a
regular
basis
during
the
warmer
weather
of
the
spring
and
summer
this
is
one
of
my
personal
favorites
a
great
brew
and
a
prime
example
of
the
belgian
white
style
beer
it
is
very
light
for
the
style
and
is
not
heavily
or
overly
carbonated
which
both
help
in
making
it
such
an
easily
drinkable
beer
its
not
overly
spiced
like
some
of
the
other
whites
out
there
give
this
brew
a
shot
if
you
ever
come
across
it
you
wont
be
disappointed
best
in
bottle
most
leaved
out
it
goes
down
smooth
and
is
very
refreshing
d
in
spades
one
can
swirl
this
down
all
damn
day
d
drinkability
as
you
might
imagine
is
high
this
is
a
staple
at
the
abbey
on
tap
but
id
never
had
it
out
of
a
can
or
bottle
before
d
as
stated
above
this
has
a
great
fruity
and
well
spiced
flavor
with
an
amount
of
carbonation
thats
lowmedium
but
is
perfect
for
the
style
this
could
be
a
session
wit
it
just
makes
me
think
that
this
is
a
witbier
that
jocks
and
meatheads
could
love
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
on
the
palate
and
easy
to
drink
carbonation
is
low
so
not
as
to
overwhelm
the
delicate
flavor
of
this
beer
semidry
in
the
finish
with
hop
flavor
quite
prevalent
this
is
one
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
in
my
opinion
this
is
better
than
both
hoegaarden
and
blue
moon
in
fact
it
is
better
than
many
of
the
others
of
the
same
style
ive
drank
shipped
back
from
my
trip
to
indiana
poured
from
a
330ml
bottle
with
no
dating
info
into
a
weizen
glass
it
was
a
hazy
straw
color
with
tons
of
carbonation
it
had
a
huge
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
long
time
some
lacing
the
aroma
was
pretty
good
it
had
the
usual
wit
players
plus
a
musty
smell
to
it
saw
some
describe
as
barnyard
i
can
see
that
the
taste
was
pretty
good
as
well
but
lacked
a
bite
to
it
also
didnt
finish
as
dry
as
most
wits
i
had
this
in
vegas
a
couple
years
ago
and
remember
it
smelling
and
tasting
better
so
concerned
about
how
it
fared
in
the
hot
truck
during
shipment
will
need
to
rereview
later
am
wishing
now
i
bought
more
than
1
because
lethbridge
is
almost
2
hrs
away
must
get
favored
beer
vendor
to
get
some
of
these
in
notes
a
different
type
of
of
beer
for
its
style
i
liked
it
and
allbut
i
dont
think
i
will
go
crazy
if
i
dont
see
it
again
overall
a
fine
brew
with
good
balance
very
good
beer
i
truly
enjoyed
it
and
will
be
definately
getting
more
mouthfeeldrinkability
the
soft
silky
texture
in
the
mouth
seems
impossible
to
improve
upon
its
liquid
velvet
and
the
body
is
so
easy
and
creamy
at
only
5
and
so
balanced
in
terms
of
flavors
and
spices
this
rivals
allagash
white
as
my
goto
beers
for
this
style
this
is
more
reserved
and
more
sessionable
then
our
friend
from
maines
imo
dont
miss
the
opportunity
to
try
this
d
solid
session
beer
not
the
greatest
wheat
beer
but
a
drinker
i
could
do
over
and
over
hazy
golden
copious
white
moussey
head
coriandercitrus
plus
mystery
spice
fennel
in
the
slightly
soapy
aroma
a
tad
vegetal
plenty
of
wheat
twang
with
background
pils
sweetness
fruitycitrus
floral
very
mild
phenolics
and
a
hit
of
aluminum
from
the
can
i
poured
it
out
of
were
it
fresher
spicier
and
packaged
better
it
could
be
a
solid
solid
wit
this
review
was
done
without
adding
a
lemon
slice
to
the
beer
while
not
necessarily
traditional
it
does
help
some
of
the
flavors
quite
well
i
would
recommend
adding
an
unsqueezed
piece
of
lemon
to
this
beer
also
as
my
wife
stated
in
her
review
below
store
this
upside
down
or
give
a
very
gentle
shake
before
pouring
to
allow
the
yeast
to
rejoine
the
rest
of
the
beer
drinkability
largely
refreshing
but
very
mild
and
meek
seems
like
it
could
use
a
little
more
character
dunno
if
the
can
had
anything
to
do
with
this
not
an
outstanding
wit
but
not
a
bad
beer
an
enjoyable
witbier
mellow
and
polite
but
also
a
fantastic
host
to
the
palate
a
perfect
hot
weather
refresher
as
well
d
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
one
of
the
few
quality
beers
we
can
get
here
in
atl
in
a
can
they
cant
all
blow
you
away
recommended
by
my
man
george
at
stadium
liquor
i
am
a
fan
a
hoegaarden
whatever
its
a
good
beer
witbiers
are
a
genre
that
that
has
few
winners
and
far
more
losers
wittekerke
does
look
pretty
damn
good
with
its
murky
lemonlime
appearance
the
beer
posses
a
minimal
head
that
disapates
within
a
few
minutes
the
lace
is
bubbly
and
beautiful
i
really
did
enjoy
this
beer
it
has
a
perky
lemon
smell
i
swear
i
can
smell
a
bit
of
cotton
candy
it
has
a
mild
bite
subdued
lemon
taste
complemented
with
flavors
of
wheat
grapefruit
and
manderin
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
so
subdued
calm
inviting
crisp
and
refreshing
aftertaste
is
clean
and
fresh
the
aftertase
flows
through
the
nasal
cavity
and
stimulates
your
face
skin
and
eyes
to
make
your
nerves
feel
somewhat
alive
this
belgian
wit
was
a
treat
the
abv
is
very
tolerable
i
can
take
my
time
with
this
6
pack
and
enjoy
every
moment
body
is
about
medium
and
pretty
active
with
a
fairly
quick
snap
to
its
carbonation
that
rests
alot
of
flavors
once
it
subsides
and
warms
crisp
tangy
sweet
and
quenchable
easy
to
down
a
whole
bunch
of
a
summer
favorite
of
mine
to
keep
around
and
pretty
cheaply
priced
as
well
however
it
still
seems
better
ontap
by
a
bit
more
lemony
length
i
think
d
pretty
good
not
very
alcoholic
and
some
very
faint
flavors
make
it
pretty
drinkable
as
nothing
is
overwhelming
poured
a
nice
light
orange
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
onefinger
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
little
and
left
some
decent
lacings
citric
notes
real
noticeable
in
the
smell
especially
lemon
and
some
orange
peel
combined
with
some
spices
and
faint
clove
a
little
sharp
but
the
citric
notes
and
spices
blend
together
for
a
good
taste
with
a
medium
body
that
flows
smoothly
over
the
tongue
and
with
a
little
sweetness
from
some
malts
and
the
wheat
has
a
semisweet
finish
that
mixes
dark
fruit
with
some
yeast
since
this
was
in
a
can
and
cheap
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
the
beer
was
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
glass
where
it
shines
whitestraw
color
with
a
cloudy
body
and
a
whipped
head
on
top
that
retains
very
well
the
aroma
is
mild
fruit
and
a
bit
of
rought
grain
the
taste
is
mostly
a
blend
of
sweet
lemon
and
orange
theres
some
malted
wheat
and
medicinal
notes
to
be
found
in
the
brew
not
much
in
the
way
of
spices
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
especially
while
barbecuing
drinkability
very
refreshing
for
fans
of
the

stlye
this
is
a
must
try
served

warsteiner

a
pale

with
some
large
craters
across
the

residual

clumps
of

adhered
during
the
tasting
clean
scent
wheat
citrus
and
yeast
taste
consistent
with
nose
not
much
complexity
and
somewhat
lacking
in
terms
of
the
characteristic
spicy
character
of
a
wit
but
so
refreshing
and
smooth
mouthfeel
is
lively
and
light
leaving
a
pleasant
residual
tingle
across
the
tongue
extremely
drinkable
went
down
easy
and
definitely
makes
a
great
lawnmower
beer
good
drinkability
its
never
hard
for
me
to
drink
witbiers
d
quite
drinkable
but
no
more
than
any
other
hefeweizen
taste
is
of
light
lemony
wheat
and
is
slightly
yeasty
without
any
sour
notes
well
balanced
carbonation
yields
a
smooth
drinking
brew
a
touch
thin
in
the
spice
department
perhaps
yet
nothing
over
the
top
yields
a
reasonable
balance
kb
overall
not
my
favorite
witbier
but
it
will
definitely
suit
the
bill
if
youre
looking
for
a
wit
to
drink
and
it
happens
to
be
what
they
have
all
in
all
somewhat
plain
interesting
that
the
kerke
in
question
on
their
labeltap
handle
is
a
plain
white
clapboard
frame
thing
because
thats
the
overall
effect
of
the
beverage
plain
unassuming
mainlineprotestantstyle
witbier
no
stone
towers
or
fancy
stained
glass
with
this
one
d
yo
no
tengo
one
was
more
than
enough
for
me
i
see
people
drinking
this
at
bars
all
the
time
but
i
cant
really
see
why
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
little
to
no
head
and
rather
still
carbonation
on
the
nose
some
rough
almost
skunky
hop
notes
or
a
spice
that
smells
like
it
this
is
from
a
can
after
all
along
with
herbaceous
and
peppery
elements
on
the
palate
quite
bitter
first
off
then
acidic
before
a
mellow
biscuity
malt
quality
comes
through
the
only
thing
that
really
does
not
work
is
the
finish
which
contains
some
unpleasant
vinylandmint
flavors
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
witbier
and
its
entirely
likely
that
someone
without
the
same
sensitivity
to
whatever
is
coming
out
in
the
finish
would
enjoy
it
significantly
more
than
i
did
even
still
i
thought
it
was
decent
i
do
believe
i
have
had
my
first
skunk
beer
yikes
if
you
are
reading
this
review
dont
base
your
opinion
by
it
got
this
beer
from
total
wine
and
more
in
fort
myers
poured
a
decent
straw
color
with
some
haziness
and
a
small
white
head
smell
was
of
sweet
citrus
notes
and
some
floral
to
it
the
first
sip
made
my
lips
pucker
it
was
so
acrid
i
could
hardly
swallow
it
the
next
sip
was
just
and
bad
that
even
gave
my
throat
a
burning
sensation
i
belive
this
one
may
have
turned
to
the
darkside
i
will
have
to
try
another
fresh
one
sometime
d
a
fairly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
brew
d
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing

good

drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
authentic
summertime
bier
d
the
spice
was
a
bit
overwhelming
to
drink
more
than
one
but
overall
a
very
tasty
treat
for
such
a
creamy
feel
it
was
actually
fairly
light
and
crisp
as
well
i
havent
had
many
witbiers
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
tried
d
decent
quaffer
a
good
summer
time
drink
and
reasonable
for
the
style
i
tend
to
find
myself
moving
away
from
the
wit
styles
but
this
is
something
i
might
consider
trying
again
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
brew
inoffensive
and
quenching
yet
just
tasty
enough
to
not
feel
watery
d
very
high
and
gets
moreso
the
hotter
the
day
wittekerke
isnt
a
great
beer
but
it
sure
is
hitting
the
spot
right
now
pours
a
very
cloudy
murky
very
pale
yellow
color
with
plentiful
large
bubbled
white
head
on
the
nose
it
has
a
very
pungent
orange
and
clove
dominated
aroma
a
little
bit
of
pepper
is
there
but
overall
a
very
tart
and
citrusy
aroma
flavor
starts
out
complex
but
finishes
quickly
the
orange
and
citrus
come
through
along
with
a
tart
cider
like
flavor
finishing
quite
dry
its
not
as
thoroughly
complex
as
ommegang
or
blanche
de
chambly
but
enjoyable
nonetheless
carbonation
is
high
but
with
smaller
bubbles
as
to
bring
a
smoothness
rather
than
a
stinging
touch
very
nice
wit
what
can
i
say
really
belgian
white
is
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
in
my
opinion
ive
had
many
bws
theyre
all
distinct
and
i
havent
met
one
that
i
dont
like
this
one
is
more
distinct
mostly
in
flavor
its
more
citrusy
than
others
ive
had
avery
white
rascal
blue
moon
hoegaarten
etc
i
enjoy
it
very
much
but
availability
is
extremely
limited
one
bonus
is
that
in
my
area
this
comes
in
cans
and
steel
cans
at
that
so
i
can
take
it
to
the
park
whereas
most
bws
are
bottled
and
glass
is
banned
in
parks
this
is
a
thirstquenching
tasty
and
exceptionally
smooth
example
of
the
style
d
very
refreshing
but
too
bland
to
be
particularily
interesting
definetely
beats
your
runofthemillbeer
very
fine
beer
and
goes
with
a
lot
of
food
its
an
easy
partner
for
any
meal
dont
miss
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
it
has
some
good
flavours
but
they
are
not
as
pronounced
as
i
hoped
them
to
be
not
bad
but
there
certainly
are
some
better
wits
out
there
i
would
buy
this
one
again
but
probably
only
for
a
good
summer
session
poured

poured
a

with
a
bright
white

that
left
mild

down
the
side
of
the

with
a
slight

smell
taste
is
mild
banana
lemony

mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
slight
carbonation
its
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
drinkablity
simple
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
was
not
as
complex
as
expected
but
it
was
still
enjoyable
really
crisp
refreshing
beer
the
beer
snob
in
me
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
didnt
expect
such
a
tasty
beer
from
a
can
nice
choice
for
a
lighter
beer
especially
since
i
dont
usually
care
for
light
beer
i
buy
this
one
often
especially
for
social
gatherings
where
i
dont
want
to
drink
anything
too
heavy
this
was
my
first
belgian
from
a
can
and
i
found
this
wit
to
be
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
keep
in
mind
i
am
not
incredibly
familiar
with
belgian
whites
it
is
my
least
favorite
style
of
the
country
and
i
dont
buy
it
often
pours
a
hazy
peach
white
with
normal
head
smell
is
strong
but
seems
like
it
should
be
skunkier
smells
like
lemony
citrus
and
some
hops
taste
has
some
lemony
notes
with
slight
hop
flavors
the
taste
virtually
dies
as
the
beer
is
swallowed
but
there
is
an
aftertaste
that
lingers
for
a
bit
but
is
not
very
strong
the
last
part
of
the
taste
is
almost
a
musk
the
mouthfeel
is
good
but
very
thin
and
the
carbonation
tingles
a
bit
drinkability
is
very
good
keeping
in
mind
its
only
5
to
be
honest
this
beer
just
makes
me
want
to
go
grab
the
strongest
quadrupel
in
my
cellar
but
i
am
more
disciplined
than
that
thank
god
better
than
i
expected
for
a
beer
in
a
can
though
i
will
say
that
taste
is
orange
rind
some
spices
wheat
yeast
and
a
barely
detectable
malt
backbone
quaffable
good
but
not
a
powerful
tasting
nor
smelling
beer
d
this
beer
has
a
crazy
color
with
an
interesting
flavorespecially
for
a
wit
i
thought
it
was
very
novel
but
no
worth
another
glass
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
filling
at
all
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
lighter
belgian
beer
that
you
could
drink
for
a
very
long
time
i
could
see
myself
drinking
several
of
these
this
was
my
first
time
having
this
beer
i
happen
to
like
this
white
beer
much
better
than
hoegaarden
overall
this
beer
did
not
have
the
spice
that
hoegaarden
but
it
did
have
a
citrus
aroma
to
it
this
happened
to
be
the
second
beer
i
have
tried
from
bavik
and
am
quite
impressed
with
what
i
have
had
so
far
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
this
certainly
wouldnt
be
my
first
pick
if
i
had
a
choice
there
are
definitely
better
witbiers
out
there
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
yellowishmist
the
flavor
which
was
good
was
citrusylemonyand
pepperish
and
definitely
worth
trying
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
type
of
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
downing
a
sixer
of
this
one
although
somewhat
bland
compared
to
other
witbier
samples
this
was
nonetheless
a
solid
and
respectable
brew
not
particularly
overthetop
or
exciting
but
drinking
one
would
definitely
lead
to
another
so
i
would
buy
it
again
without
a
doubt
worth
trying
at
least
once
if
youre
a
fan
of
witbiers
but
all
in
all
there
are
better
samples
out
there
i
was
satisfied
but
not
totally
blown
away
a
predominately
citrus
taste
characterizes
this
beer
which
though
not
bad
is
not
absolutely
terrificget
me
another
now
all
said
certainly
worth
a
try
though
so
i
actually
got
to
try
this
at
whole
foods
of
all
places
and
had
a
can
of
this
with
a
slice
pof
pizza
outside
tonight
now
i
know
that
wasnt
exactly
supposed
to
go
on
that
way
but
it
did
and
it
was
cool
so
anyway
it
poured
a
bright
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
two
inch
or
so
white
head
on
top
nice
retention
gave
way
to
a
good
amount
of
lace
lots
of
visible
carbonation
was
apparent
smell
was
full
of
wheat
and
yeast
very
light
with
little
in
the
way
of
any
floral
quality
to
it
the
taste
was
decent
enough
light
grain
mixed
in
with
a
touch
of
yeast
a
little
bit
of
a
banana
or
some
kind
of
kick
in
the
in
with
a
smooth
and
well
carbonated
light
body
to
it
overall
not
too
bad
i
have
had
better
and
i
have
had
worse
it
was
average
at
best
but
no
worse
then
that
i
could
have
had
another
easily
as
they
were
like
water
an
average
witbier
for
me
this
beer
just
doesnt
have
any
richness
to
it
not
bad
but
very
average
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
for
the
price
its
definitely
worth
the
investment
i
cant
complain
a
bit
about
this
though
the
style
isnt
my
favorite
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
thats
easy
drinking
though
not
very
interesting
body
was
a
paradox

that
big
head
was
followed
by
a
smooth
brew
without
much
carbonation
pretty
nice
brew
but
im
wondering
if
i
could
make
my
way
thru
a
sixer
of
them
drinkability
im
not
real
big
on
belgian
wits
but
this
stuff
is
pretty
good
appearance
is
light
yellow

with
a
touch
of
head
on

that
dissolves
down
to
a

lemon
and
some
pencil
shavings
flavor
is

this
ones
not
bad

commendable

with
some
adequate
carbonation
on

of
the

this
kind
of
packaging
has
its
benifits
one
to
look
for
in
belgium
railway
stations
or
local
beerliquor
shop
in
us
d
this
a
delicious
drinkable
and
sessionable
witbier
low
on
alcohol
and
big
on
flavor
probably
best
as
a
summer
beer
but
can
be
enjoyed
yearround
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
not
what
youd
expect
from
belgium
never
saw
this
before
and
tried
it
at
rocks
bar
in
chicago
they
served
it
in
the
wittekerke
glass
from
the
can
nice
glass
and
a
nice
looking
beer
it
was
a
glowing
cloudy
straw
with
a
great
creamy
head
sweet
bready
and
lemony
aromas
nice
bit
of
sweetness
and
well
balanced
by
a
tart
finish
chewy
mouthfeel
very
sessionable
this
went
down
easy
just
before
and
through
the
finish
it
becomes
very
bland
and
watery
and
and
that
ruins
it
for
me
too
bad
initially
i
thought
id
really
like
this
wit
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
creamy
milky
whiteyellow
color
havent
seen
this
before
the
smell
is
light
and
slightly
floral
the
taste
is
light
and
delicate

it
has
slight
malt
and
hop
flavors
topped
off
with
some
floral
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
feels
suited
for
this
beer
overall
this
is
a
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
oelergud
d
id
drink
it
all
day
long
in
the
summer
hell
id
drink
it
all
day
long
in
the
fall
and
spring
too
a
wonderful
treat
when
all
you
want
is
a
brisk
nonoffensive
beer
on
tap
in
tampa
pours
a
thick
white
head
cloudy
golden
yellow
was
served
with
an
orange
slice
but
i
disposed
of
that
smells
of
citrus
tastes
lightly
of
lemons
and
little
of
orange
but
i
missed
the
peppery
sensation
not
a
fan
of
the
after
taste
better
than
blue
moon
but
i
want
to
try
more
belgian
whites
before
i
compare
it
further
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
but
overall
very
a
average
wit
a
worthy
choice
for
a
thirst
quencher
but
not
so
much
if
you
are
craving
the
taste
of
a
classic
wit
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
belgian
wit
this
class
has
underwhelmed
me
but
i
certainly
enjoy
this
more
than
hoegarten
or
blue
moon
drinkability
if
you
can
get
by
the
taste
its
refreshing
thirst
quenching
not
my
can
o
beer
though
average
belgian
wit
nothing
to
speak
of
other
than
a
decently
drinkable
summer
beer
pours
a
nice
hazy
and
cloudy
yellow
into
a
witekereke
glasswhich
looks
like
a
small
vase
lots
of
thick
head
that
seemed
like
half
of
the
beer
kind
of
a
standard
belgian
wit
although
a
bit
drier
a
good
summer
beer
but
nothing
more
than
average
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
cloudiness
and
a
pure
white
head
smells
like
corn
more
than
anything
with
some
slight
hops
tastes
average
me
not
being
a
huge
hefe
fan
probably
has
something
to
do
with
its
mediocrity
also
has
a
little
bit
of
bitterness
to
it
but
nothing
major
mouthfeel
is
great
and
yummy
not
bad
not
great
dability
a
clean
but
somewhat
subdued
interpretation
of
the
style
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
these
one
after
another
but
the
same
could
be
said
for
a
light
american
lager
a
nice
wit
pours
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
size
pillowy
white
head
light
lacing
average
head
retention
aroma
fairly
good
cloves
banana
primarily
nice
wit
taste
not
as
crisp
as
st
barnadus
but
not
bad
either
fairly
good
astringency
and
citrus
cloves
banana
taste
mouthfeel
is
rich
a
bit
more
sweetness
in
the
finish
than
i
would
like
but
overall
a
good
beer
drinkability
is
fine
at
5
with
a
very
pleasant
refreshing
taste
this
would
be
a
fine
summertime
session
beer
i
wish
every
place
that
serves
up
widmers
hefe
could
switch
to
something
like
this
instead
poured
a
light
and
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
a
massive
head
of
white
pillowy
foam
it
had
one
of
those
head
of
foams
that
made
me
stop
pouring
half
way
because
it
would
have
overflowed
the
glass
if
i
didnt
the
head
of
foam
had
really
good
retention
that
left
behind
a
white
pillowy
film
white
foamy
rings
along
the
edge
of
the
beer
and
a
few
streaks
of
white
sticky
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
started
off
heavy
with
dry
pepper
and
with
some
juicy
fruits
and
a
slice
of
lemon
behind
it
after
it
really
warms
up
the
dry
pepper
aroma
dissipates
and
then
is
replaced
by
citrus
fruits
and
a
small
drop
of
honey
in
the
background
im
not
too
sure
what
happened
to
the
juicy
fruits
or
the
slice
of
lemon
after
the
dry
pepper
dissipated
they
must
have
left
with
the
dry
pepper
the
taste
was
on
the
thin
side
with
just
a
few
small
tastes
of
pepper
dry
citrus
fruits
a
slice
lemon
a
few
hops
and
with
a
little
dab
of
yeast
to
finish
it
off
there
wasnt
much
going
on
in
the
taste
it
was
average
at
best
the
mouthfeel
was
really
light
not
too
watery
and
with
a
minuscule
aftertaste
of
grains
citrus
fruits
and
a
little
yeast
so
this
is
where
a
few
malted
grains
emerge
they
werent
in
the
initial
taste
so
i
guess
the
aftertaste
called
them
up
and
told
them
to
stop
their
hiding
i
thought
it
was
pretty
much
a
slightly
above
average
belgian
witbier
i
thought
the
can
was
a
nice
touch
this
beer
in
a
can
would
make
a
nice
choice
if
youre
going
out
on
a
hot
summer
day
picnic
pours
a
whitish
golden
color
and
has
a
decent
thin
head
that
only
dissipates
a
little
the
smell
is
sweet
with
some
fruity
aromas
the
taste
is
quite
smooth
and
moderately
carbonated
its
bitterness
is
light
but
has
a
nice
orange
flavor
to
it
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beer
but
i
particularly
like
this
one
this
beer
is
true
to
the
witbier
style
and
cant
really
improve
much
the
smell
was
a
little
mild
but
other
than
that
i
recommend
this
one
the
only
thing
id
change
about
this
is
the
lacing
since
its
average
and
not
up
to
the
level
of
this
brews
other
attributes
the
aftertaste
lightly
lingers
like
that
of
a
banana
and
theres
no
bitterness
or
sharpness
in
the
back
here
additionally
the
5
00
abv
cant
be
felt
at
all
here
making
this
a
great
choice
as
i
transition
from
winters
dark
ale
to
the
lighter
fares
of
spring
highly
recommended
overall
not
the
tyical
witbier
and
deserves
its
place
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
its
very
straightforward
theres
nothing
fancy
here
but
its
very
authentic
it
doesnt
pull
any
punches
im
not
sure
if
this
keg
was
bad
as
i
see
my
experience
was
different
then
all
the
reviewers
of
the
bottled
version
the
sharp
edge
didnt
think
so
although
they
agreed
it
sucked
and
gave
me
another
beer
on
the
house
if
i
ever
get
around
to
trying
this
out
of
a
bottle
or
on
draft
somewhere
else
ill
revisit
my
review
but
for
now
im
basing
it
on
that
very
unpleasant
experience
drinkability
i
learned
i
like
witbier
beers
nice
clean
taste
i
could
see
myself
drinking
alot
of
these
this
brand
does
come
in
cans
but
i
purchased
it
in
a
bottle
if
youre
looking
for
a
one
bottle
masterpiece
then
look
elsewhere
if
youre
looking
for
a
strong
beer
look
elsewhere
if
youre
looking
for
a
quality
beer
for
session
drinking
then
give
this
a
try
nothing
spectacular
here
wittekerke
is
a
light
bodied
witbier
that
is
distinctive
but
underwhelming
the
taste
is
prodominately
soap
and
lemon
its
hue
is
lighter
and
clearer
than
most
in
this
style
the
sourness
of
this
brew
makes
it
distinctive
in
this
cluttered
style
must
be
ice
cold
as
the
sourness
and
soapiness
only
get
worse
as
it
warms
less
spiciness
and
floralness
than
you
would
hope
for
this
style
good
on
a
cold
day
but
save
the
money
and
buy
blue
moon
which
i
dare
say
is
better
dissapointed
and
confused
on
how
this
is
so
close
to
the
source
of
the
style
maybe
this
is
just
the
bud
light
of
witbiers
sorry
the
fact
that
this
beer
still
sells
wellinside
source
and
is
about
8
a
six
really
makes
the
dissapearance
of
such
a
fine
domestic
version
like
celis
wht
that
much
more
painful
overall
a
quality
wit
that
deviates
from
the
normal
hoegaarden
or
other
more
popular
wits
pick
one
up
and
enjoy
ists
high
drinkability
and
beer
thirstquenching
ability
barkeep
pour
me
a
hoegarrden
please
one
of
my
all
time
favourite
session
brews
and
quite
honestly
i
am
unsure
why
i
am
simply
inexplicably
drawn
to
this
beer
even
though
i
know
hoegaarden
is
a
better
representation
of
this
style
ill
buy
this
almost
everytime
bizarre
eh
anyway
this
pours
a
cloudy
pale
whiteyellow
with
a
beautiful
snowwhite
head
about
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
co2
streams
upward
while
moderate
bits
of
debris
float
about
this
looks
like
a
really
nice
belgian
wit
smell
is
dry
cracked
wheat
and
coriander
plenty
of
coriander
the
taste
is
fairly
strong
of
coriander
as
well
mostly
on
the
finish
which
is
a
bit
bitter
everything
about
this
wit
seems
to
meld
together
nicely
mouthfeel
is
very
light
as
is
typicall
for
the
style
and
drinkability
is
very
high
imo
as
i
stated
earlier
on
this
is
one
of
my
favourite
session
brews
and
i
am
particularly
fond
of
this
in
the
plastic
wrapped
6pk
can
package
drinkability
nice
refreshing
summertime
brew
light
tasting
beer
would
compliment
many
outdoor
hot
day
activities
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
a
good
refreshing
summer
beer
i
like
it
11
2oz
can
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
whiteish
yellow
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
lacing
all
over
the
glass
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
a
zesty
citrus
smell
freshly
squeezed
lemon
juice
and
some
spice
the
taste
is
a
little
more
subdued
than
i
expected
but
is
pleasant
nonetheless
there
is
more
fresh
lemon
in
the
taste
along
with
some
spice
overall
this
is
a
highly
enjoyable
wit
that
is
especially
enticing
in
those
situations
in
which
bottles
are
not
an
option
this
would
be
perfect
to
take
on
a
trip
to
the
beach
where
cans
are
the
only
option
highly
drinkable
and
recommended
wittekerke
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
from
a
33
cl
can
citrus
lemon
peel
is
the
dominant
aroma
citrus
flavors
are
nicely
balanced
with
wheat
in
the
taste
coriander
is
not
particularly
strong
in
this
wit
a
quality
that
i
like
not
being
a
big
fan
of
coriander
an
enjoyable
wit
worth
a
try
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
color
with
about
an
inch
or
so
white
head
with
good
lacing
it
smells
like
lemon
coriander
and
wheatgrain
it
tastes
like
lemon
spiced
hops
wheat
and
coriander
its
light
bodied
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
it
goes
down
smooth
and
its
nice
and
refreshing
this
would
probably
be
more
of
a
summer
beer
for
me
but
overall
i
think
its
a
decent
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkablility
are
very
good
a
bit
creamy
and
goes
down
easy
a
pale
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
little
head
that
disapates
quickly
the
aroma
and
taste
are
bland
a
very
little
sweetness
no
spices
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
carbonated
not
much
to
enjoy
about
this
beer
nothing
bad
but
nothing
good
either
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
except
for
a
replacement
to
7up
drinkability
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
even
if
nobody
else
could
appreciate
the
delicate
flavors
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
in
the
warmer
months
this
beer
has
convinced
me
that
i
need
to
try
more
belgian
wheats
this
has
surpased
hoegaarden
as
my
favorite
whit
beer
appearance
is
cloudy
and
moderately
dark
yellow
carbonation
was
tight
small
bubbles
and
offered
up
some
nice
lacing
odor
was
sort
of
spicy
and
i
think
was
picking
up
the
coriander
flavor
was
great
spicy
and
light
at
the
same
time
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
but
would
be
reluctant
to
go
to
the
canned
stuff
at
the
liquor
store
just
doesnt
seem
the
same
overall
this
is
an
ok
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
purchased
it
this
beer
pours
with
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
slight
head
the
smell
is
stronger
than
most
whites
and
it
seems
to
be
a
terrific
balance
between
the
malts
and
spices
the
taste
is
solid
too
but
as
the
bottle
goes
down
it
seems
to
become
too
monolithic
and
it
loses
the
specialness
to
it
its
a
good
beer
to
get
into
belgian
wittes
but
nothing
worth
seeking
out
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
witbier
nice
and
refreshing
i
prefer
it
over
hoegaarden
not
much
of
any
spice
in
this
one
the
smell
is
fairly
good
with
plenty
of
wheat
malt
and
a
minor
amount
of
spice
the
taste
starts
with
wheat
malts
and
gives
way
to
yeast
flavors
some
honey
and
citrus
can
be
found
in
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
while
drinkability
is
good
d
its
no
hoegaarden
but
not
bad
give
it
a
shot
i
know
its
light
and
simple
and
even
watery
but
you
know
what
its
still
pretty
damn
good
very
drinkable
and
light
but
with
you
huge
flavors
its
sort
of
the
best
of
a
little
beer
pretty
drinkable
would
go
very
well
with
fish
or
pretty
much
any
light
meal
a
good
solid
witbier
in
a
convenient
package
2
thumbs
up
solid
thirst
quenching
summer
beer
probably
a
good
one
for
anyone
who
claims
to
not
like
beer
becuase
of
the
bitter
hops
i
cant
think
of
a
good
reason
anyone
other
than
a
dedicated
hophead
wouldnt
drink
this
beer
pretty
good
for
a
canned
beer
acceptable
taste
and
palate
for
a
belgian
wit
this
ones
really
crisp
and
refreshing
way
better
on
tap
than
in
the
can
surely
drinkable
its
basically
a
lighter
smoother
softer
version
of
a
good
heffe
lighter
in
color
pale
yellow
with
the
same
cloudyness
as
a
heff
aromas
are
softer
and
lighter
nice
sweetness
from
wheat
malt
sweet
citrus
honey
and
sweet
spices
flavors
are
similar
a
mild
wheat
and
honey
sweetness
with
corriander
curraco
orange
peel
and
lightly
peppery
or
cinemonlike
good
doses
of
citrus
sweetness
and
smoothness
no
bittering
or
tartness
mouthfeel
is
light
creamy
powdery
silky
and
smooth
crisp
finish
with
no
drying
low
aftertaste
its
a
lot
like
drinking
a
sweetheart
a
very
plesant
beer
for
summer
consumption
or
for
the
ladies
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
orange
juice
in
the
morning
perhaps
with
french
toast
that
has
been
prepared
with
a
little
grand
marnier
this
beer
would
be
perfect
ahem
bier
all
in
all
an
acceptable
bottle
of
beer
i
just
couldnt
get
past
the
bottom
of
the
clothes
hamper
aroma
nice
light
wheat
body
crisp
and
watery
with
an
abv
that
would
make
this
a
hot
weather
drink
all
day
in
the
sun
kind
of
beer
its
about
the
best
witbier
i
think
ive
tasted
cheers
what
a
great
beer
great
on
ahot
day
goes
down
easy
and
not
heavy
this
was
out
of
the
bottle
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
see
this
on
the
cooler
shelves
in
cans
also
im
heading
back
to
pick
some
up
for
tailgating
clean
and
refreshing
pretty
cheap
6
99
for
a
6pack
of
cans
lightbodied
and
decent
flavor
with
a
moderate
abv
this
beer
goes
down
way
too
easy
especially
on
a
hot
day
id
never
take
one
of
these
over
a
hoegaarden
but
id
definitely
recommend
it
to
anyone
very
enjoyable
refreshing
but
with
great
flavor
as
far
as
canned
beers
this
is
up
there
with
dales
pale
ale
in
terms
of
quality
frankly
i
wish
more
beers
would
come
in
cans
taste
is
broad
in
texture
and
has
a
brief
bitter
splash
before
the
refreshing
finish
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
hoppy
aftertaste
this
is
any
easy
beer
to
like
and
will
be
handy
over
the
next
few
months
drinkability
compared
to
some
other
wits
this
is
a
bit
bland
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
taste
although
there
is
a
nice
coriander
flavor
just
lacks
the
banana
and
wheat
flavors
that
are
to
be
expected
this
is
not
a
bad
lawnmower
beer
a
lot
beter
than
the
macros
light
straw
odd
nose
grassy
and
herbal
hay
and
wheat
somewhat
fruity
but
not
coriander
more
of
a
green
melon
and
cooked
onion
taste
is
more
of
the
same
dry
vegetablelike
with
turnups
and
cucumbers
along
with
green
melon
and
lemon
interesting
but
dull
as
hell
overall
it
was
a
fairly
decent
witbier
but
nothing
worth
going
out
of
the
way
for
what
an
absolutely
refreshing
treat
this
well
brewed
beverage
pours
from
the
growler
a
cloudy
lightgold
color
with
a
descent
but
not
huge
foamy
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
with
a
nice
spiced
grassy
aroma
of
herbs
and
fruit
the
taste
is
wheaty
and
wonderful
this
is
brew
of
exceptional
drinkability
i
regret
not
buying
more
after
the
very
first
taste
definitely
pickup
growler
of
this
witbier
or
give
it
a
try
if
you
see
it
pours
out
to
a
light
hazed
yellow
color
with
a
medium
head
of
white
foam
some
notes
of
lace
and
champagne
like
carbonation
aromas
of
sweet
malt
and
yeast
over
fresh
grain
exceptional
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
flavors
of
light
malt
grain
mild
hops
biscuits
yeast
and
corn
go
lightly
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
bubbly
and
refreshing
quite
nice
good
drinkability
this
would
make
a
superb
summer
quaffer
recommended
a
satisfying
refreshing
drinkable
belgian
that
works
very
well
as
a
palate
cleanser
hints
of
pear
peach
orange
tangerine
yeast
and
a
little
malt
i
like
the
mouthfeel
and
this
one
goes
down
smooth
not
a
bad
wit
at
all
generally
refreshing
though
not
huge
on
flavor
it
brings
to
mind
a
light
wheat
beer
an
expensive
lawnmower
beer
or
a
notch
above
that
this
is
a
nice
affordable
and
refreshing
wheat
beer
from
belgium
of
all
places
its
6
99
a
six
pack
around
here
and
only
comes
in
cans
nice
alternative
to
take
on
a
fishing
trip
or
anywhere
cans
are
preferred
pours
a
nice
hazy
yellow
color
aroma
is
loaded
with
banana
and
spices
flavor
is
a
bit
sodapopish
as
it
is
quite
sweet
but
balanced
with
a
sour
cherry
finish
nice
banana
and
spice
flavor
i
certainly
prefer
this
over
most
white
beers
including
blue
moon
etc
hops
are
perceived
first
when
it
hits
your
tongue
and
then
again
in
the
finish
however
this
is
a
mildly
hopped
beer
as
you
might
expect
i
recommend
pours
a
faint
yelllow
with
a
nice
head
which
quickly
reduces
to
a
fine
foamy
lace
around
the
glass
pale
yellow
with
expended
yeast
floating
around
smells
of
bannana
and
corriander
witha
hint
of
cinnamon
first
taste
was
smooth
with
some
carbonation
and
slight
bitterness
not
a
very
dry
wit
and
does
not
have
the
mouthfeel
or
taste
of
hoegaarden
or
weisenstephen
but
would
be
an
easy
introduction
to
this
awesome
style
this
witbier
has
a
transluscent
pale
yellow
straw
color
the
head
is
white
and
tite
laced
the
nose
has
hints
of
banana
corriander
and
just
a
hint
of
clove
the
mouth
is
hit
first
with
the
fruit
and
then
a
soft
esthery
spice
wraped
in
a
biscuit
softly
coated
with
honey
that
is
carried
over
the
tongue
with
a
medium
carbonation
structure
there
is
a
slight
citrus
linger
if
you
are
not
into
the
heavy
cloved
versions
of
witbiers
this
is
a
great
place
to
start
i
dont
see
why
this
has
scored
low
with
other
baers
its
a
solid
wit
bier
drinkable
and
refreshing
an
excellent
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
quite
a
refreshing
brew
it
probably
will
never
challenge
hoegaarden
for
one
of
the
top
belgian
wits
but
this
is
quite
an
exceptable
brew
and
is
worth
a
try
if
you
enjoy
the
style
or
other
wheat
brews
drinkability
an
excellent
session
beer
if
youre
unwilling
to
shell
out
the
big
bucks
for
a
hoegaarden
or
blanche
de
chambly
uf
the
body
is
very
light
and
fluffy
with
a
bit
of
a
prickly
sting
on
the
tongue
from
the
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
just
dont
give
the
beer
a
good
long
sniff
before
every
drink
like
ive
been
accustomed
to
doing
extra
points
for
drinkability
considering
this
is
available
in
cans
for
my
fellow
outdoor
adventurist
type
bas
drinkability
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
these
and
love
that
it
is
a
belgian
beer
that
comes
in
little
cans
very
refreshing
this
might
be
my
new
summer
beer
for
out
on
the
boat
or
any
other
activity
that
calls
for
cans
for
that
matter
poured
this
beer
from
a
11
2
oz
can
into
a
mug
the
color
is
a
cloudy
light
tan
color
look
a
little
thin
compared
to
what
i
have
been
exposed
to
from
this
style
it
has
very
little
head
that
is
gone
in
a
second
it
has
a
very
zesty
citrus
and
light
wheat
scent
nice
zesty
citrus
and
wheat
flavors
but
a
little
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
not
the
best
belgium
white
that
ive
ever
had
but
pretty
good
overall
very
straw
like
in
colour
with
a
definite
haze
the
nose
is
lemons
and
oranges
with
a
little
spice
the
taste
is
quite
light
with
citrus
in
the
background
and
less
spice
than
some
wits
a
little
weak
in
body
and
flavour
i
find
this
beer
to
be
strictly
a
summer
patio
quencher
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
very
evenly
balanced
and
light
enough
to
drink
a
few
of
very
pale
slightly
foggy
strawyellow
with
a
mist
of
sediment
that
very
quickly
and
actively
mixes
evenly
into
the
beer
a
snowwhite
creamy
cap
of
froth
dissipates
pretty
evenly
smells
very
lightly
of
wheat
and
toasty
biscuit
malt
light
slightly
spiced
and
slightly
sweet
wheat
malts
fairly
typical
and
predictable
with
hints
of
lemon
and
biscuity
malt
typically
light
body
for
a
typical
belgian
wheat
ale
totally
typical
and
average
this
beer
pulls
a
straight
3
one
of
the
most
drinakble
belgian
wits
ive
come
across
it
has
a
great
mouthfeel
and
strikes
a
perfect
balance
between
complex
yet
subtle
flavors
a
great
session
beer
or
revitalizing
tonic
good
carbonisation
makes
moutfeel
together
with
good
taste
als
ok
and
yes
this
is
well
drinkable
on
a
warm
day
or
even
in
fall
now
drinkability
aside
from
the
aroma
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
solid
choice
im
sure
there
are
others
out
there
and
viewing
the
list
there
are
many
more
belgians
i
want
to
try
as
ive
had
more
american
wits
than
belgians
but
its
worth
a
shot
for
sure
especially
for
summer
and
this
virginia
heat
which
wont
quit
for
some
reason
appropriately
conditioned
body
drinkability
ok
but
why
this
brew
pours
a
light
hazy
yellow
a
thin
but
persistent
white
head
stays
on
top
of
this
beer
through
95
of
the
ride
down
the
glass
aroma
is
of
lemon
and
a
mild
hint
of
spicegrass
feel
and
must
from
the
yeast
flavor
is
a
tart
lemon
zing
with
a
crisp
bitter
finish
a
light
smooth
mouthfeel
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
there
has
been
a
few
post
of
the
perfect
lawnmower
beer
this
is
it
a
must
try
brew
i
wasnt
as
impressed
the
second
time
around
still
a
fine
daytime
brew
but
id
like
it
to
clean
up
a
bit
better
very
citrusy
lemon
towards
the
finish
and
a
light
hoppy
presence
cheers
reminds
me
some
of
blue
moon
but
probably
a
little
better
kind
of
a
basic
workman
like
white
beer
im
sure
there
are
many
others
out
there
better
but
this
is
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
great
for
the
golf
course
or
the
boat

not
the

but
worth
a
try
refreshing
stuff
fine
for
a
summer
picnic
one
of
the
more
interesting
canned
beers
out
there
a
hazey
straw
yellow
colored
beer
has
a
big
fluffy
white
head
and
great
lace
the
aroma
is
light
with
hints
of
yeast
and
a
lemony
tartness
the
flavor
has
a
light
herbal
character
with
a
nice
lemony
note
and
a
little
corriander
and
spice
in
the
background
definitely
a
good
hot
weather
drink
quite
refreshing
pours
a
very
cloudy
pale
yellow
almost
white
color
with
a
whispy
white
head
smell
is
a
typical
wit
soft
grain
with

is

with
a
fruity
and
spicy
background
with
hints
of
corriander
lemon
and
orange
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
high
carbonation
just
what
you
want
from
a
wit
drinkability
is
high
since
this
is
after
all
a
wit
a
pretty
good
belgian
wit
if
nothing
special
its
refreshing
and
drinkable
no
complexity
but
drinkable
and
refreshing
would
make
a
good
lawnmower
beer
if
i
wanted
to
pay
10
49
a
sixpack
for
that
kind
of
brew
but
since
i
can
find
comparable
domestic
beers
for
probably
four
bucks
less
im
not
likely
to
pick
this
up
again
either
the
us
crafters
are
really
good
at
witbiers
holy
moses
comes
to
mind
or
the
true
european
versions
are
far
more
understated
than
their
american
counterparts
but
this
was
disappointing
to
say
the
least
it
was
very
very
mild
almost
weak
ill
look
elsewhere
for
european
witbiers
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
very
unique
in
just
about
every
aspect
new
to
witbier
would
like
to
try
more
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
refreshing
drinkability
would
be
high
on
a
warm
day
pretty
good
but
not
one
to
overwhelm
medium
boddied
pleasant
sudsy
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
drinkable
not
remarkable
but
solid
nice
fluffy
white
head
atop
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
beer
the
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
hops
and
belgian
spiciness
along
with
a
funky
bananaandorange
blend
the
flavor
is
maybe
not
as
tart
as
id
expect
but
it
is
nice
and
flavorful
with
a
slightly
malty
flavor
and
a
slight
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
some
fruitiness
is
apparent
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
good
too
with
a
fluffiness
like
the
head
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
its
a
little
more
mundane
than
what
i
expect
from
a
witbier
seems
more
like
a
german
wheat
beer
than
a
belgian
witbeer
but
thats
a
good
beer
too
also
although
i
was
skeptical
of
the
cans
i
think
it
improves
the
overall
flavor
and
freshness
especially
since
there
is
no
way
light
can
spoil
the
beer
in
the
can
not
the
best
butt
a
nice
thirst
quencher
one
other
thing
i
love
to
swirl
this
one
on
the
tongue
and
in
the
mouth
before
the
swallow
especially
during
a
long
drinking
session
in
belgium
on
the
stronger
belgian
offerings
it
simply
never
fails
to
clear
the
passages
and
reinvigorate
the
palate
and
erase
a
flagging
heavy
or
soggy
feel
after
a
plethora
of
hefty
8
brews
its
a
great
midsession
pickmeup
beer
for
whenever
you
feel
a
sumerian
beer
trance
on
the
horizon
average
witbier
and
at
9
a
6
pack
qpr
is
very
low
vanilla
milk
shake
creamy
and
i
like
vanilla
aroma
on
the
wheat
love
the
shake
appearance
however
a
barnyard
onion
like
aroma
and
taste
comes
out
in
the
actual
drink
and
subtracts
from
the
rest
of
the
surface
was
better
warmer
and
at
end
with
sediment
laces
freshly
in
at
smokeless
joes
wittekerke
wit
is
damn
fine
beer
i
had
never
heard
of
it
before
picking
it
off
the
shelf
last
month
but
its
now
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
although
im
drinking
this
bottle
in
early
january
it
strikes
me
as
the
perfect
summer
brew
ill
be
sure
to
load
up
when
the
warm
weather
arrives
now
if
i
could
just
remember
where
i
bought
it
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
tastes
more
like
a
soda
than
a
beer
decent
at
best
imo
may
try
again
down
the
line
11
2
oz
33l
overall
pretty
refreshing
and
good
for
a
lighter
brew
to
end
the
day
with
a
decent
if
not
spectacular
example
of
a
wit
a
vigorous
pour
produces
a
huge
bubbly
head
that
quickly
recedes
into
a
clumpy
fingers
width
of
snow
white
head
the
body
is
the
color
of
banana
juice
and
lively
with
fat
bubbles
of
carbonation
the
aroma
is
thickly
doughy
with
yeast
and
pleasantly
snappy
with
esters
banana
apple
a
healthy
dash
of
white
pepper
is
present
as
well
the
flavor
is
a
lot
more
vibrantly
fruity
than
some
of
the
muted
fruit
flavors
ive
tasted
in
other
wits
big
zingy
flavors
of
pineapple
apple
banana
a
bit
of
rye
bread
peeps
in
along
side
a
dense
chewy
dough
the
finish
has
a
tiny
tiny
spicy
hint
the
fruit
flavors
are
definitely
the
star
here
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
refreshing
but
has
substance
the
carbonation
level
is
perfect
adds
texture
but
is
not
distracting
a
very
nice
wit
pours
a
murky
lemon
color
smells
like
lemon
pith
especially
taste
is
quite
refreshing
but
also
different
seriously
this
is
like
drinking
a
lemon
meringue
pie
nevertheless
its
quite
refreshing
probably
better
for
a
warm
summer
day
than
a
cold
fall
night
that
or
dessert
appearance
is
lemonade
yellow
hazy
and
effervescent
with
a
dense

decent

lacing
is

33
cl
bottle
no
freshness
dating
but
i
know
i
got
a
fresh
one
im
a
creature
of
habit
and
i
have
a
plethora
of
glasses
plus
im
a
stickler
for
appropriate
glassware
when
consuming
beer
so
it
was
poured
it
in
an
authentic
wittekerke
glass
which
is
frosted
so
when
i
say
it
pours
a
clouded
lemon
yellow
the
frosting
of
the
glass
may
have
impaired
this
id
assume
its
clouded
having
this
beer
a
handful
of
times
beforehand
it
has
a
pretty
nice
creamy
white
cap
on
it
citrus
and
spicy
aromas
with
a
bit
of
dusty
yeast
notes
to
it
tastes
pretty
good
clean
and
lightly
wheaty
with
coriander
in
the
background
my
friend
described
a
flavor
of
hot
dog
water
in
it
like
the
water
left
behind
after
boiling
hot
dogs
im
mildly
amused
i
notice
more
of
a
grainy
clovey
citric
aspect
to
the
whole
thing
but
then
hearing
somebody
describe
a
beer
absurdly
sometimes
tickles
the
funny
bone
very
refreshing
and
thirstquenching
wellcarbonated
from
what
i
understand
this
beer
used
to
be
called
bavik
white
and
was
renamed
after
a
popular
sitcom
in
belgium
which
translates
into
white
church
hence
the
white
church
on
the
top
of
the
taphandle
when
ive
seen
this
on
draught
anyhow
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
this
fresh
and
on
a
hot
humid
night
such
as
this
wittekerke
cans
are
available
in
the
us
so
i
decided
to
buy
a
six
pack
to
review
this
is
a
pale
straw
coloured
brew
that
is
cloudy
and
has
a
nice
off
white
head
of
foam
that
lasts
and
actually
leaves
nice
lacing
as
well
the
aroma
is
very
simple
and
consists
of
wheat
citrus
fruits
and
light
spices
the
taste
follows
suit
as
this
is
a
very
uncomplex
belgian
wit
the
spices
are
subdued
compared
to
other
versions
and
even
the
citrus
flavors
are
not
as
pronounced
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
and
the
drinkability
is
good
as
well
wow
this
beer
really
reminds
me
of
belgium
where
i
often
drink
canned
beers
outside
in
wonderful
surroundings
although
this
beer
is
not
as
good
as
other
beers
that
are
available
in
cans
in
belgium
hoegaarden
rodenbach
etc
this
is
one
of
the
best
canned
import
beers
that
i
have
had
in
the
states
and
at
7
a
sixer
who
can
complain
goes
down
smooth
hazy
pale
yellowgold
in
hue
there
isnt
any
animation
that
is
noticeable
so
it
looks
a
bit
dull
a
white
head
topped
off
the
beer
it
was
a
little
less
than
a
finger
in
height
at
the
apex
on
a
normal
pour
head
retention
was
poor
as
it
quickly
faded
to
a
skimpy
cap
and
then
a
foamy
collar
there
was
no
subsequent
lacing
it
looks
like
a
wit
just
typical
the
nose
is
musty
yeasty
wheaty
and
vaguely
fruity
mostly
lemons
i
only
get
a
suggestion
of
spice
this
aspect
is
too
soft
for
a
wit
imo
the
potency
is
small
yes
the
nose
is
inviting
but
im
not
really
impressed
really
what
is
this
beer
saying
speak
clearly
please
anyway
it
is
time
to
drink
the
palate
is
the
most
favorable
aspect
of
this
beer
this
is
a
very
tasty
wit
i
love
the
spiciness
it
is
perfect
not
too
strong
but
very
wide
and
lingering
once
the
lemon
flavors
and
bright
acidity
kicks
in
wow
there
is
a
hint
of
orange
zest
too
plus
suggestions
of
cloves
vanilla
musky
wheat
soft
bread
and
earthysweetness
at
the
back
are
some
vague
fruitiness
and
more
sweetness
sugary
tasty
the
aftertaste
is
musky
spicy
and
wheaty
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
good
the
carbonation
is
low
and
soft
medium
in
body
silky
smooth
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
but
not
straight
out
of
the
can
i
experimented
with
drinking
the
beer
without
a
glass
it
was
awful
very
harsh
and
alcoholic
you
see
always
use
a
glass
still
i
wish
the
canned
version
were
available
locally
as
it
would
be
a
godsend
during
these
hot
nebraska
summers
i
purchased
a
sixpack
in
minneapolis
out
of
pure
curiosity
it
was
a
sound
buy
it
is
very
refreshing
low
on
complexities
but
tasty
enough
to
care
well
worth
trying
and
yes
there
are
much
better
wits
on
the
market
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
and
is
topped
by
a
thin
pale
head
my
nose
picks
up
a
subtle
spicy
aroma
with
notes
citrus
coriander
and
grain
this
beer
is
very
light
on
the
palate
lightly
sweet
with
a
lemony
spritzyness
this
is
simple
and
straight
forward
a
true
summer
refresher
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
best
can
beers
that
i
have
ever
had
though
it
is
a
distant
3rd
to
old
chub
and
dales

this
one

wouldnt

enjoyed
on
515
at
the
staghead
in
red
wing
mn
served
in
wittekerke
glass
on
a
wittekerke
glass
mat
nice
touch
color
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
bright
white
head
very
little
aroma
a
bit
of
citrus
spice
body
was
very
thin
but
smooth
taste
was
unimpressive
very
little
standout
characteristics
i
let
it
warm
and
it
really
didnt
improve
it
any
overall
unimpressive
but
not
a
bad
beer
will
try
again
some
time
to
reevaluate
as
the
average
to
above
average
reviews
here
conflict
with
my
thoughts
this
beer
pours
a
very
goldenlight
color
with
a
small
but
thick
froth
head
it
smells
of
wheat
alcohol
bitters
and
citrus
flavors
the
beer
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
when
cold
and
tastes
consistently
wheaty
and
citrusy
this
beer
has
uncanny
smoothness
and
is
highly
recommended
for
a
filtered
wheat
this
one
comes
equiped
with
a
solid
white
head
on
it
and
a
nice
fresh
aroma
a
very
cloudy
brew
with
a
watereddown
juice
look
to
it
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
doesnt
have
the
strong
wheat
taste
to
it
like
some
others
citrus
is
definately
present
in
this
beer
and
it
lasts
from
start
to
finish
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
a
drinkable
brew
i
consider
it
the
mre
of
belgian
beer
one
sip
and
oh
god
awful
like
drinking
a
flour
and
water
mixture
nasty
this
one
gets
dumped
down
the
drain
glug
glug
glug
i
respect
this
beer
mostly
for
its
authenticity
but
my
inclination
is
to
demand
more
from
it
than
it
is
apparently
willing
to
deliver
a
wedge
of
lemon
might
compliment
the
tartness
but
i
prefer
a
beer
that
doesnt
lean
on
condiments
to
enhance
its
innate
properties
this
is
a
good
belgian
wit
but
certainly
not
as
good
as
vuuve
allagash
or
celis
still
its
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
even
the
mildly
noticeable
alcohol
isnt
akin
to
the
style
it
kept
me
wishing
for
more
orange
flavor
and
phenols
the
beers
as
it
dispenses
from
the
11
2
ounce
brown
bottle
a
bemused
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
modest
in
size
and
bright
white
head
the
texture
creamy
the
lace
a
thin
sheet
to
drape
the
glass
the
nose
has
a
hint
of
floral
crisp
citrus
like
id
say
lemons
youd
say
limes
somewhat
sweet
pleasant
as
they
go
maybe
a
touch
of
coriander
and
yeast
start
is
lightly
sweet
thinly
malted
top
is

its

the

finish

modest

extremely
dry
and
lingering
aftertaste
a
great
arizona
summer
beer
me
thinks
light
yellow
with
a
decent
head
light
smell
some
citrus
notes
nothing
spectacular
but
ok
taste
was
citrusy
and
light
might
be
a
very
good
alternative
to
light
beer
finished
mildly
mouthfeel
was
light
and
smooth
drinkability
was
very
good
definitely
easy
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
spicey
yet
sweet
wheat
malt
scent
the
yeast
enhances
the
aroma
and
gives
it
a
banana
like
fruity
smell
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
fruity
wheat
taste
but
it
is
overshadowed
by
the
metal
can
flavor
it
also
has
a
mild
grapefruit
flavor
that
isnt
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
average
also
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
less
than
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
witbier
it
just
goes
to
show
you
never
trust
belgian
beer
in
a
can
smooth
flavor
and
great
aftertaste
the
beer
is
very
tasty
overall
a
little
different
then
a
typical

for
a

or
any

at
any

overall
impression
even
out
of
a

this
is
a
great
wit
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
the
style
and
it
seems
largely
unappreciated
the
spice
level
is
balanced
making
it
deliciously
drinkable
ive
been
told
that
the
brewing
method
for
this
beer
is
atypical
rather
than
add
the
spices
to
the
boil
they
are
steeped
like
a
tea
and
added
to
the
wort
at
bottling
very
drinkable
brew
a
decent
if
not
stellar
wit
beer
this
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
flavor
ts
an
ok
white
beer
but
nothing
compared
to
celis
hoegaarden
or
allagash
it
doesnt
have
the
crispness
id
expect
light
gold
color
very
cloudy
medium
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
sweet
a
medium

whitewit
beer
mild
tasting
and

more
flavor
and
body
than
a
typical
wit
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
finish
is
smooth
and
clean
aftertaste
is
sweet
nice
refreshing
taste
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
after
mowing
the
lawn
instead
of
lemonade
ive
had
this
in
the
can
but
its
also
available
now
in
an
11
2
oz
bottle
light
citrus
notes
blend
nicely
with
the
bitter
orange
peel
on
the
palate
slightly
cloudy
appearance
when
poured
into
a
glass
but
not
too
much
floating
around
great
carbonation
especially
for
a
can
adds
to
the
refreshing
appeal
of
this
wit
i
think
wittekerke
is
a
good
represention
of
the
style
and
very
drinkable
for
such
an
inexpensive
brew
the
shrinkwrapped
six
pack
cans
just
add
to
the
fun
another
canned
offering
hazy
yellow
white
head
as
is
typical
of
the
wits
nothing
spectacular
some
spice
and
citrus
smell
not
particularly
noticeable
tastes
clean
with
a
medium
body
i
mostly
taste
orange
and
lemon
peels
more
bitter
than
other
wit
biers
but
not
hop
bitter
of
course
some
mild
spices
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
especially
since
it
came
in
a
can
again
not
a
bad
beer
the
overwhelming
citrus
flavor
is
surprising
a
bit
tasty
but
not
mindblowing
at
all
could
make
an
interesting
beer
choice
for
a
micronovice
pat
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
nice
puffy
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
a
little
wheaty
and
spicy
with
some
hints
of
citrus
the
flavor
was
very
smooth
and
had
a
little
spice
with
the
expected
wheatyness
expected
from
a
wit
beer
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
belgian
wheat
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
for
a
relatively
cheap
belgian
wit
not
a
terrible
beer
at
all
since
it
comes
in
cans
even
though
i
didnt
sample
it
that
way
this
shoots
to
the
top
of
my
can
list
it
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
begian
wit
but
the
can
makes
it
convenient
for
location
that
do
not
allow
bottles
a
nice
beer
to
bring
to
the
beach
where
bottles
are
frowned
upon
pours
an
opaque
frosted
straw
color
with
a
snowy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
constant
thin
topping
lots
of
trailing
and
clinging
lace
the
aroma
is
damp
earthy
and
limeaidlike
the
wheaty
malt
body
is
thin
and
the
bitterness
is
almost
totally
lemonlimelike
lightly
sweet
and
mildly
tangy
a
slight
back
of
the
throat
astringent
sensation
detracts
a
little
from
the
overall
drinkability
but
all
in
all
fairly
good
canned
beer
wittekerke
a
belgian
white
beer
a
hazy
golden
color
with
tiny
flecks
likely
the

not
much

but
what
there
is
was
rather
thick
with
nice
staying
power
and
lace
aroma
is
slightly
astringent
but
rather
weak
hmm
very
soda
tasting
for
a
beer
very
much
like
a
7
up
with
just
a
hint
of
drynesssourness
toward
the
end
very
little
aftertaste
but
significant
carbonation
im
torn
this
is
very
light
nice
flavor
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
but
on
the
other
hand
its
more
like
a
pop
than
a
beer
when
its
hot
its
worth
reaching
for
this
brew
poured
a
transparent
yet
cloudy
wheat
yellow
colored
body
and
a
small
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
that
was
mostly
lasting
it
had
a
mild
citrus
like
flavor
it
is
a
drinkable
brew
but
not
great
brew
and
one
i
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
decent
mouthfeel
and
a
decent
summer
brew
serve
this
baby
ice
cold
for
maximum
enjoyment
heree
an
understated

good

understated
can
be
rather
charming

when
its
96
degrees
and
humid
and
your
mouth
is
parched
and
begging
to
be

completly
quenching
summer
beer
this
one
pours
a
pretty
hazy
pale
yellow
and
offers
up
subtle
aromas
of
citrus

and
grain
the
snow
white
head
provides
a
nice
accent
color
however
this
quickly
fades
still
the
taste
is
right
on
with
ample
carbonation
this
refreshes
in
the
way
a
cool
lemonade
might
but
its
an
all
grownup
drink
that
indeed
tastes
like
beer
it
wont
win
any
awards
for
complexity
so
lighten
up
and
just
enjoy
it

almost
to

like
others
who
have

lacked

iam

with

not

are
many
better
out

a
little
sweet
banana
lemon
and
some
spices
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
a
decent
white
but
i
prefer
the
hoegaarden
or
allagash
versions
my
first
introduction
to
witbiers
occured
this
summer
and
i
was
able
to
sample
both
hoegaarden
and
wittekerke
on
tap
i
remember
at
the
time
really
enjoying
the
wittekerke
even
more
so
than
the
hoegaarden
however
when
i
came
back
from
california
i
really
havent
seen
this
beer
so
i
decided
to
sample
it
again
this
time
in
a
bottle
appears
a
light
hazy
golden
hue
very
pale
int
he
pour
with
a
gleaming
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
is
an
amazing
mixture
of
banana
spices
and
honey
sweetness
this
is
one
spiced
up
monster
of
a
wheat
beer
wittekerke
in
my
opinion
does
everything
hoegaarden
attempts
and
does
it
better
thank
heavens
i
have
found
a
real
white
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
chewy
with
traces
of
the
spiced
up
yeasty
wheat
combo
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
and
amazingly
done
very
drinkable
i
am
sold
that
this
is
the
best
belgium
wit
style
i
have
had
to
date
normally
i
steer
clear
of
anything
that
comes
in
a
can
but
this
one
was
highly
recommended
poured
super
cloudy
honey
colored
with
very
little
head
and
only
mild
lacing
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
a
very
smooth
ale
and
impressive
to
me
only
because
of
the
can
factor
i
didnt
really
taste
anything
metallic
at
all
subtle
wheat
taste
and
even
less
yeast
flavor
i
would
definately
drink
it
again
but
there
are
so
many
better
than
this
great
in
a
glass
restricted
enviroment
i
e
boating
by
the
pool
etc
pours
a
very
cloudy
pale
yellow
almost
looks
like
lemonade
has
a
thin
white
head
and
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
is
lemon
yeast
and
a
touch
of
cloves
flavor
is
dominated
by
lemon
with
some
musty
yeast
notes
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
light
a
very
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
thanks
to
nerofiddled
for
this
interesting
brew
a
belgian
white
in
a
can
a
first
for
me
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
like
diluted
grapefruit
juice
aroma
is
fresh
and
clean
lightly
yeasty
mouthfeel
is
likewise
quite
light
but
not
thin
flavors
of
soft
whitebread
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
tropical
fruit
in
the
far
background
nothing
noteworthy
but
quite
pleasant
and
drinkable
sort
of
a
hoegaarden
light
a
lawnmower
beer
of
the
belgian
variety
pours
to
a
cloudy
straw
color
looks
a
bit
like
grapefruit
juice
it
forms
a
white
heat
the
quickly
dissipates
the
aroma
is
a
citric
zest
fruitiness
but
i
also
detected
a
grainy
smell
as
well
the
flavor
again
has
fruitiness
to
it
somewhat
lemony
it
has
a
slightly
tart
finish
to
it
it
is
a
definite
refresher
it
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
feel
that
this
was
much
to
sweet
to
be
a
wit
beer
it
has
some
good
lemon
characteristics
and
a
nice
wheat
taste
but
knid
of
a
dull
sweetness
that
i
dont
like
to
much
i
think
this
pales
in
comparison
to
hoeggarden
in
bottle
and
especialy
on
tap
i
didnt
have
it
with
a
lemon
so
maybee
that
would
even
out
the
sweetness
next
time
well
give
it
a
go
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
topped
by
a
thick
white
head
that
settles
down
rather
easily
the
aroma
was
dominated
by
wheat
taste
is
quite
satisfying
and
it
tastes
fine
at
any
time
of
the
day
look
out
for
this
beer
worth
tasting
it
soft
texture
wonderful
drinkability
some
graininess
but
still
creamy
luxurious
i
could
drink
this
by
the
pitcher
on
a
hot
summer
day
tastes
great
anytime
though
notes
id
prefer
this
brew
bottleconditioned
though
the
canned
version
is
not
bad
at
all
and
is
a
perfect
switch
if
in
a
situation
that
restricts
you
to
canned
beverages
only
all
in
all
a
decent
white
ale
the
cloudy
yellow
body
is
topped
by
a
firm
and
bright
white
head
that
holds
well
and
leaves
some
nice

the

offers
a
somewhat

the
body
is
light
but
with
an
extremely
fine
natural
carbonation
that
makes
it
ohsosupple
in
the
mouth
like

the
flavor
offers
very
lightly
tangy
notes
of
sugary
lemon
and
orange
peel
along
with
a
bright
fresh

restrained
clove
spiciness
wonderfull
the
finish
is
short
and
lightly

with
a
very
gentle
reminder
of
the
flavor
that
was
just
had
beckoning
you
to
have
another
sip
a
very
delicate
beer
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
the
spice
is
so
clear
although
it
comes
at
the
expense
of
a
limited
yeast
and
to
some
extent
malt
character
one
of
my
thoughts
at
first
tasting
this
was
budweiser
with
spices
but
its
far
more
complicated
than
that
still
this
is
very
refreshing
and
quite
enjoyable
with
some
interesting

with

a
great

for

leave

theres
nothing

either
so
to
me
mediocre

the

really
didnt
shine

like
id

quite

definatly

spicy
with
undertones

flavor
was

with
plenty
of

very
refreshing
beer
ill
have
to
research
the
importer
it
was
great
while
it
lasted
1st
time
trying
from
the
variety
pack
did
not
catch
the
citrus
taste
as
much
as
the
coriander
and
chamomile
but
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
label
says
best
served
at
48
degrees
i
poured
this
at
52
degrees
and
this
difference
was
of
no
significance
to
me
chuck
an

youll

this

this
is
an
unfiltered
brew
you
can
not
see
though
it
holy

has
the
look
of
most
witbier
brews
on
the
market
the
smell
is
sweet
with

some

and

now
for
the
taste
it
is
sweet
with
some
spices
and

there
is

this
came
as
part
of
the
spring
variety
packs
and
as
far
as
im
aware
as
of
this
review
this
is
the
only
way
to
acquire
this
choice
brew
besides
going
to
the
brewery
itself
pick
this
up
in
the
sampler
part
the
waves
of
bland
witbiers
sweet
and
malty
wheat
and
honey
reminds
me
ig
a
belgian
with
more
of
a
mouth
feel
good
head
and
hazy
lacking
in
scent
and
overall
burst
of
flavor
overall
through
and
through
a
really
solid
beer
when
spices
are
well
done
in
a
beer
they
add
so
much
to
the
complexity
and
texture
this
beer
is
a
prime
example
great
lakes
continues
to
deliver
great
beer
this
beer
was
a
nice
surprise
poured
nice
and
clear
big
foamy
head
that
didnt
last
citrus
rushed
my
nose
and
the
cold
crisp
smooth
taste
filled
my
mouth
sweet
not
too
bitter
with
a
nice
dry
crisp
fresh
ending
this
may
be
a
mainstay
at
the
brewpub
this
beer
is
a
bit
better
on
tap
more
body
than
the
bottled
version
and
the
coriander
and
cardamom
was
more
pronounced
one
of
the
better
witbiers
out
there
good
in
the
bottle
great
on
tap
o
i
enjoyed
the
wit
nice
and
clean
i
really
enjoyed
that
there
was
no
spent
yeast
in
this
beer
had
a
hard
time
finding
the
chamomile
in
the
beer
though
im
not
familiar
with
chamomile
o
a
solid
wit
the
finish
on
this
beer
really
makes
it
great
o
great
beer
picked
a
case
up
on
clearance
for
20
even
better
deal
overall
a
very
good
wit
that
quickly
became
my
go
to
beer
after
hikes
in
a
recent
western
trip
the
creaminess
does
distinguish
this
one
from
others
in
the
style
very
refreshing
i
would
certainly
get
this
again
excited
to
try
a
different
version
of
this
style
this
brew
looks
and
smells
like
a
typical
wit
compared
to
some
of
my
preferred
versions
of
this
style
this
one
is
a
little
too
tart
and
heavy
on
the
lemon
and
the
finish
is
on
the
long
side
a
solid
beer
but
not
outstanding
for
my
taste
overall
another
really
nice
hot
weather
beer
pick
up
the
six
if
you
see
it
this
beer
is
better
and
a
light
lager
on
any
hot
day
when
you
just
want
a
cold
refreshing
beer
solid

made
by

this

taste
is

fruity
and
sweet
not
quite
sure
if
this
is
really
my
thing
its
very
different
from
what
i
usually
drink
it
reminds
me
an
awful
lot
of
trois
pistoles
and
at
such
a
lower
price
might
be
called
its
cheaper
relative
doesnt
quite
have
the
same
depth
and
is
more
lightly
carbonated
very
drinkable
its
well
balanced
but
in
closing
not
quite
my
thing
overall
a
good
easy
drinking
brew
and
one
to
go
for
if
you
have
the
chance
overall
a
very

drinkable

i
will
definitely
have
this
again

and
again
the
chamomile
is
subtle
but
adds
interest
to
what
is
already
a
very
good
witbier
the
yeast
is
not
quite
as
strong
as
some
belgian
examples
but
im
quite
impressed
and
refreshed
by
this
ale
from
the
12
oz
bottle
overall
i
bought
a
case
for
vacation
to
be
beach
after
having
this
a
few
times
because
i
loved
how
easy
drinking
and
tasty
this
offering
is
great
lakes
never
lets
me
down
this
one
is
great
for
a
beer
snob
like
me
who
is
your
typical
hophead
but
also
great
for
your
hefe
and
witbier
fanatic
i
love
hoppy
ipas
and
this
beer
is
far
from
that
but
it
has
plenty
of
other
characteristics
that
please
the
palate
and
its
a
great
summer
beer
highly
recommend
o
good
taste
easy
drinking
but
i
feel
it
lacks
a
bit
of
a
punch
when
compared
to
some
others
in
the
style
overy
pleasant
beer
has
great
flavor
and
very
drinkable
highly
recommend
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
probably
the
most
notable
thing
about
it
although
in
general
it
is
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
a
nice

this
one

with

a

is

some

it
has
a

some

and
faint

not
bad
at
all
overall
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
brew
that
is
a
real
treat
definitely
recommended
thanks
again
wes
for
those
who
like
their
wits
expressive
and
full
flavored
this
ones
for
you
big
bold
clove
is
all
up
in
this
shit
and
then
some
plus
its
packing
one
of
the
best
mouthfeels
this
side
of
the
ol
miss
another
accomplishment
from
one
of
the
best
breweries
in
america
overall
i
really
enjoyed
the
lightness
and
parallel
complexity
of
this
beer
casual
sophisticated
and
balanced
i
personally
would
have
liked
to
experienced
a
more
potent
flavor
the
flavor
at
the
end
felt
a
bit
watered
down
if
you
know
someone
who
feels
intimidated
by
craft
beer
this
could
be
the
beer
that
is
not
overwhelming
and
very
welcoming
to
the
dainty
pallet

clean
beer
its
hard
to
make
a
normal
witbier
stick
out
but
this
does
great
craftsmanship
o
a
good
witbier
but
nothing
special
to
be
honest
a
little
disappointing
from
great
lakes
but
i
only
bought
one
so
i
cant
complain
o
this
one
did
not
disappoint
in
the
least
way
to
go
great

overall
there
is
not
a

going
on
it
is
onpoint
for

but
lacking
memorable
texture
or
flavor
o
this
and
oberon
always
mean
summer
is
right
around
the
corner
overall
a
wellseasoned
light
easy
to
drink
beer
overall
a
nice
easy
drinking
wit
decent
amount
of
flavor
good
beer
for
the
hot
days
mouthfeel
this
is
a
beer
that
i
prefer
to
be
a
bit
thinner
than
normal
and
it
doesnt
disappoint
my
thinking
easy
drinking
and
rather
smooth
a
very
well
made
white
o
a
solid
wit
perfect
for
a
summer
session
id
take
this
over
oberon
and
just
about
any
others
of
this
style
save
dancing
man
wheat
o
this
one
started
out
just
average
but
things
picked
up
at
first
sip
everything
worked
together
here
and
you
were
left
with
a
refreshing
taste
o
i
like
this
one
this
is
one
of
my
more
favorite
summer
beers
on
the
boat
or
when
i
finish
mowing
the
law
nice
and
smooth
and
always
refreshing
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
great
overall
beer
that
is
very
refreshing
it
is
perfect
for
summer
but
would
be
great
at
any
time
of
the
year
a
very
good
example
of
a
witbier
one
of
if
not
my
favorite
all
time
beer
highly
recommended
overall
it
was
a
leaning
to
the
side
of
spiciness
which
is
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
i
thought
it
was
good
and
refreshing
but
i
dont
expect
to
pick
it
up
again
the
holy
moses
witbier
is
quite
tasty
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
good
carbonation
that
forms
a
nice
frothy
head
that
dissipates
and
laces
throughout
the
draw
the
smell
includes
spice
clove
and
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
starts
with
clove
then
lemon
citrus
then
finishes
with
a
punch
of
spice
which
comes
of
the
pallet
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
at

it
makes

other
than
that
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be

a
very

the

than

make
an

excellent
summer
beer
and
a
good
take
on
the
style
overall
this
was
pretty
good
i
will
be
drinking
this
again
next
summer
drinkability
a
good
summer
brew
and
tasted
very
fresh
on

would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
when
offered
on

a
nice
unexpected
find
on

and
an
enjoyable
brew
for
first
great

offering
this
brew
has
a
great

its
light
enough
that
you
can
drink
a
few
and
yet
heavy
enough
for
you
to
enjoy
a
great
brew
another
great
brew
by
great

brewing
company
overall
great
little
summer
wit
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
funk
and
complexity
but
never
fails
at
being
very
well
balanced
and
easy
drinking
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
another
sixer
definitely
worth
a
try
the
aftertaste
really
makes
the
spicy
notes
shine
which
is
a
good
thing
and
leaves
you
thirsty

is

brings
a
good
dosage

letting
the

for

lacking

i
am
a

fan
and
of
witbier
but
not
ofholy
moses
my
nose
sent
off
warning
signals
when
i
took
a
whiff
but
it
looked
good
in
a
pilsner
glass
there
was
not
one
distinctive
taste
that
jumped
out
at
me
but
the
overall
spiciness
was
too
much
it
felt
smooth
in
my
mouth
and
throat
but
the
aftertaste
was
not
refreshing
i
would
never
drink
this
again
overall
i
thought
this
was
an
average
witbier
it
was
ok
but
not
great
and
i
feel
like
that
is
because
of
the
heavy
amount
of
spices
in
the
beer
a
little
spice
can
go
a
long
way
and
it
seems
like
there
was
just
to
many
spices
in
this
beer
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
harpoons
winter
warmer
but
most
of
the
flavors
in
the
beer
got
drowned
out
by
the
spices
i
liked
the
look
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
the
most
about
this
beer
i
liked
the
large
amount
of
spices
in
this
beer
the
least
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
there
are
many
other
widely
available
witbiers
that
have
better
balance
if
you
are
a
die
hard
witbier
fan
and
like
your
beers
heavily
spiced
then
you
might
want
to
give
this
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
put
that
much
effort
into
it
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
as
solid
as
the
rest
of
their
lineup
and
it
could
use
some
tweaking
so
far
this
has
been
my
least
favorite
brew
from
them
as
far
as
witbiers
go
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
i
was
offered
one
but
i
feel
like
blue
moons
grand
cru
was
better
and
more
balanced
making
that
still
my
favorite
witbier
to
date
overall
a
good
witbier
like
i
said
the
spicyness
can
give
a
little
too
much
kick
but
its
still
a
tasty
beer
i
have
concerns
with
trying
new
witbiers
as
most
are
subpar
and
the
style
doesnt
leave
a
lot
to
experiment
with
wits
are
either
a
good
or
bad
interpretation
of
a
pretty
welldefined
flavor
profile
i
like
the
balance
on
this
one
though
i
prefer
them
to
be
a
little
bolder
o
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
overall
and
represents
the
style
well
i
had
sworn
off
wheat
beers
after
trying
most
of
the
more
popular
brands
but
this
one
makes
me
think
i
should
revisit
this
category
o
overall
this
was
a
crisp
and
light
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
perfect
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
sitting
on
the
deck
on
a
nice
summer
day
o
overall
a
really
solid
brew
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
just
not
impressed
too
much
chamomile
this
felt
more
like
an
experimental
than
a
wit
fuller
bodied
than
expected
with
lots
of
bready
yeast
and
a
crisp
spicy
character
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
earthy
and
sweet
notes
into
a
slightly
dry
finish
hints
of
coriander
and
pepper
along
with
earthy
grassy
hops
which
are
balanced
by
sweet
notes
of
apple
and
lemon
well
balanced
refreshing
and
it
tastes
better
than
it
looks
and
smells
a
lot
of
white
ales
strike
me
as
being
very
mediocre
however
i
would
put
this
one
in
the
very
good
category
though
it
is
not
the
best
version
of
the
style
that
i
have
ever
had
just
like
almost
every
other
great
lakes
brew
that
i
have
tried
this
one
is
very
well
made
and
will
not
let
you
down
o
i
wish
the
chamomile
meter
was
a
little
lower
on
this
brew
but
all
in
all
interesting
and
wellcrafted
but
one
is
more
than
enough
overall
pretty
good
not
amazing
and
i
would
still
take
many
other
yearround
wits
to
this
one
but
it
wasnt
a
disappointment
light
bodied
proper
carbonation
easy
to
drink
a
few
bottles
of
this
with
no
problem
a
good
witbeer
from
great
lakes
would
have
scored
higher
if
the
citrus
aroma
and
flavor
were
both
a
little
stronger
overall
while
its
not
a
spectacular
beer
i
really
have
no
complaints
about
it
the
flavour
is
well
balanced
and
its
very
drinkable
i
could
definitely
put
back
a
few
of
these
on
a
patio
sometime
this
summer
great
form
of
a
classy
summer
beer
o
i
pass
one
of
the
lesser
favorites
from
great
lakes
o
not
a
huge
fan
the
sweet
wheaty
white
bread
character
is
dominant
and
not
so
delicious
lacking
in
the
subtle
balance
of
spice
yeast
malt
and
hop
that
makes
a
great
wit
presents
two
fingers
of
bleached
white
microfoam
light
and
airy
delicate
dimpling
effect
as
it
dissolves
decent
retention
and
the
lacing
too
sticks
around
a
touch
longer
than
expected
pale
yet
bright
straw
yellow
colored
liquid
considerable
amount
of
bubbles
whirling
around
as
well
as
fine
particulate
matter
certainly
plays
the
part
visually
unusually
thick
and
dewy
nose
lemon
to
orange
juice
and
reduction
coriander
and
cinnamon
spice
croissant
dough
and
fresh
yeast
lemongrass
and
violets
apricot
peach
and
some
banana
fruit
the
chamomile
semimuted
mediumbodied
plus
feels
fluffy
and
very
expansive
the
carbonation
helping
it
fill
the
mouth
entirely
the
clove
coriander
cumin
to
black
pepper
spice
gives
it
verve
and
here
the
lemon
orange
citrus
drier
and
with
more
zing
there
is
a
bitterness
in
the
grassy
element
more
pronounced
as
it
warms
yeast
pie
dough
honey
comes
through
finishes
sweeter
with
elevating
apricot
peach
apple
fruit
the
flavors
are
deep
if
not
especially
complex
what
makes
the
beer
is
the
alternation
of
textures
very
tactilely
engaging
even
though
i
feel
theres
something
missing
in
holy
moses
compared
to
better
witbiers
its
refreshing
enough
and
at
least
worth
a
shot
especially
in
the
raging
heat
of
summer
o
easy
drinking
but
overall
pretty
disappointing
i
had
high
expectations
for
this
beer
given
the
overall
positive
reviews
cant
say
ill
be
buying
another
6pack
an
interesting
beer
and
a
well
crafted
beer
just
not
something
i
could
get
excited
for
i
think
i
liked
this
better
on
tap
im
sure
the
score
could
be
bumped
had
there
been
a
better
pour
into
a
better
glass
and
the
carbonation
wasnt
as
high
as
i
mentioned
above
ive
had
this
on
tap
34
times
already
this
year
and
i
can
definitely
say
that
this
is
a
much
better
tasting
beer
on
tap
than
it
is
from
the
bottle
i
had
this
from
the
bottle
a
year
or
two
ago
and
was
not
that
impressed
when
it
was
offered
o
tap
recently
i
tried
it
reluctantly
remembering
my
experience
from
a
year
or
two
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
so
if
you
can
get
this
on
tap
do
so
from
the
bottle
however
which
is
what
this
review
is
then
eh
it
is
ok
o
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
offering
from
glbc
which
is
my
favorite
brewery
i
expected
more
refreshment
from
a
beer
of
this
style
but
instead
my
takeaway
here
is
just
a
watereddown
belgian
drinkability
is
high
for
what
thats
worth
but
it
definitely
leaves
me
unimpressed
a
rare
miss
from
glbc
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
witbier
from
great
lakes
this
might
be
the
best
summer
release
ive
had
so
far
o
refreshing
and
mild
a
good
beer
to
share
with
those
who
are
still
getting
into
beer
as
the
flavor
doesnt
punch
you
in
the
face
and
the
abv
isnt
overwhelming
overall
i
would
buy
this
again
and
if
in
a
variety
case
would
love
it
i
believe
i
got
an
uber
fresh
bottle
with
a
best
by
10211
must
have
been
bottled
weeks
ago
straight
from
the
source
in
ohio
great
lakes
does
it
again
yum
another
solid
brew
from
great
lakes
the
body
is
light
and
manageable
with
a
solid
carbonation
level
the
overall
experience
with
this
beer
is
about
what
id
expect
from
an
american
wit
it
is
a
palatable
summer
beer
that
any
beer
drinker
could
crack
open
and
enjoy
nothing
special
but
nothing
unpleasant
this
beer
is
lightflavored
easy
drinking
and
a
perfect
companion
on
a
hot
sunny
sunday
afternoon
a
real
thirstquencher
i
couldnt
drink
it
fast
enough
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
head
is
two
inches
of
fluffy
white
foam
that
recedes
slowly
into
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
coriander
lemon
bitter
orange
peel
and
tangy
wheat
this
is
exactly
what
i
want
in
the
aroma
of
a
witbier
the
taste
is
a
bit
spicier
than
the
aroma
with
a
lot
of
coriander
and
a
hint
of
cardamom
it
also
has
a
strong
wheat
presence
and
some
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
appropriately
high
refreshing
carbonation
and
a
velvety
texture
overall
this
just
might
be
the
best
witbier
i
have
ever
tasted
i
will
be
drinking
a
lot
of
this
while
it
is
around
this
is
a
pretty
good
wit
plenty
of
flavor
might
be
a
little
heavy
for
a
longer
session
but
putting
down
2
or
3
shouldnt
be
an
issue
a
nice
option
to
have
for
the
summer
months
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
witbier
o
a
great
witbier
with
alot
of
spice
very
drinkable
overall
this
beer
is
what
summertime
is
all
about
only
problem
is
its
released
to
early
and
done
too
soon
this
needs
to
come
out
juneish
and
finish
up
in
august
so
you
could
drink
this
at
bbqs
at
the
beach
and
at
summer
gatherings
this
beer
crushes
blue
moon
with
it
smoothness
and
fruity
flavors
very
nice
witbier
that
anyone
can
enjoy
notes
again
pleasantly
surprised
by
one
of
the
most
unassuming
great
lakes
brews
another
quality
offering
worth
keeping
in
mind
for
a
fresh
and
quaffable
wheat
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
witbier
summit
scandia
was
my
favorite
wit
rip
but
i
have
the
nice
glass
as
a
memento
but
this
is
probably
now
the
next
best
thing
my
only
gripe
and
it
is
a
minor
one
is
that
it
could
be
a
tad
drier
d
another
quality
brew
from
great
lakes
probably
the
best
witbier
ive
had
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
very
white
thin
head
very
light
aromas
of
cream
lemon
orange
and
spice
the
taste
is
still
fairly
light
but
more
robust
than
the
aromas
more
lemon
and
orange
not
much
spice
and
a
nice
creaminess
not
quite
as
effervescent
or
crisp
as
some
wits
but
some
nice
subtle
creamsicle
notes
going
on
here
nice
summer
beer
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
after
mowing
the
lawn
this
beer
pours
out
a
yellowish
cloudy
body
with
a
thick
whitehead
that
has
good
retention
lacing
and
carbonation
the
smell
consists
of
some
spices
orange
peel
yeast
and
bread
i
could
picture
myself
enjoying
this
with
some
orange
or
lemon
flavored
bread
or
muffins
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
biscuit
like
taste
that
quickly
follows
with
some
citrus
and
orange
peel
after
that
the
spices
and
coriander
takes
over
and
finishes
off
with
a
nice
bread
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
has
some
bite
to
it
thanks
to
the
spices
holy
moses
this
has
got
to
be
perhaps
the
best
witbier
i
have
tried
and
the
taste
is
much
more
balanced
than
some
other
ones
that
either
had
too
much
spiciness
or
too
much
citrus
in
it
ill
gladly
be
drinking
this
one
many
more
times
in
the
upcoming
months
o
good
another
fantastic
style
from
great
lakes
o
a
zesty
drinkable
summer
beer
try
this
refreshing
brew
too
bad
this
thing
was
loaded
with
diacetyl
it
just
overpowered
everything
it
even
had
a
veggie
character
to
it
which
reminded
me
of
melted
butter
on
top
of
cooked
veggies
such
as
brussel
sprouts
in
a
way
i
dont
mind
it
but
something
is
off
here
o
a
refreshing
witbier
that
tastes
pretty
traditional
and
is
a
fantastic
springsummer
brew
when
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
nice
hazy
orange
color
with
a
little
white
head
that
lays
down
to
a
nice
thin
lace
around
the
top
the
aroma
is
nice
and
inviting
with
some
spices
and
coriander
the
taste
is
nice
a
crisp
i
taste
some
clove
and
banana
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
with
not
flavors
that
linger
very
nice
mouth
feel
and
is
overall
a
good
beer
this
has
always
been
a
goodie
from
great
lakes
yes
they
have
better
offerings
but
if
youre
into
witbiers
its
a
must
12
ounce
bottle
pours
hazy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
recedes
quickly
aromas
of
spices
floral
and
citrus
taste
of
nice
herbal
spices
and
citrus
light
to
medium
carbonation
with
medium
body
citrus
and
herbal
flavors
linger
on
the
finish
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
brew
not
great
but
good
to
try
once
if
you
like
lighter
less
intense
beers
not
overwhelming
flavor
but
decent
flavors
kicking
around
try
once
if
you
like
the
style
dhigh
i
was
a
bit
put
off
by
the
date
and
the
fact
that
its
november
but
if
i
could
find
this
throughout
the
summer
id
try
to
always
have
it
around
m
less
than
stellar
carbonation
is
a
bit
low
for
the
style
leaving
the
body
rather
thin
finish
is
fine
except
for
a
slight
bitterness
i
dont
expect
from
the
style
im
used
to
a
dry
to
medium
sweet
and
spicy
finish
really
psyched
to
get
my
grubby
ma
hands
on
this
one
a
gift
from
my
mid
west
connection
poured
into
a
goblet
pours
an
opaque
cloudy
orange
wiht
a
nice
fluffy
head
smells
of
bananna
clove
and
bubblegum
going
on
nice
sweet
taste
with
a
mild
hop
profile
real
nice
balance
definitely
another
great
beer
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
it
would
be
in
the
fridge
all
summer
this
would
be
a
great
summertime
brew
as
expected
highly
drinkable
which
is
no
suprise
overall
definitely
worthy
of
a
case
if
youre
looking
for
the
style
a
moderate
pour
yields
a
half
inch
of
white
foam
that
settles
to
a
single
layer
brew
is
hazy
yellow
and
fairly
carbonated
ton
of
bubbles
on
the
glass
but
it
settles
down
after
a
few
minutes
smell
has
a
light
sweetness
yeast
citrus
spice
taste
as
a
good
bite
of
cinnamon
clove
and
mixed
hop
fairly
light
sweet
body
feel
is
a
bit
thin
finishes
with
lingering
stale
cinnamon
and
a
bit
of
citrus
rind
tatse
is
orange
and
honey
followed
by
corriander
and
balanced
by
a
bitter
orange
peel
finnish
tatse
is
good
but
the
mouth
feel
is
even
better
good
carbonation
nice
pop
to
the
flavors
a
quality
beer
wow
what
a
complete
exedous
from
other
great
lakes
brews
the
appearance
was
biblical
in
nature
and
the
smell
tempted
me
to
write
a
letter
to
the
thessalonians
explaining
the
word
the
brew
tastes
like
it
used
water
from
nazareth
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
complete
revelation
as
for
the
drinkability
i
feel
like
ive
been
commanded
to
drink
10
of
them
d
good
again
from
great
lakes
its
not
stand
out
but
nice
regardless
the
spice
seems
just
a
touch
heavy
but
important
in
the
final
product
regardless
d
this
beer
was
crisp
and
refreshing
not
as
light
as
i
think
it
should
have
been
a
good
drinking
beer
that
has
a
lighter
abv
so
it
is
very
sessionable
d
was
a
good
brew
except
for
the
after
taste
that
kind
of
threw
me
off
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
has
a
nice
coriander
flavor
coupled
with
the
spice
a
very
well
done
brew
and
very
sessionable
great
lakes
is
a
tremendous
brewer
another
great
brew
from
them
as
far
as
wits
go
i
approve
of
this
one
very
refreshing
its
not
so
sweet
as
to
be
cloying
but
still
incorporates
all
thats
great
about
wits
d
at
5
4
alc
with
a
great
mouth
feel
and
lighter
witbier
taste
make
it
a
worthy
session
beer
to
keep
in
mind
on
a
scorcher
of
a
day
quite
refreshing
a
full
bodied

great
balance

white
head
the
nose
is
a
mix
betwee
the
fruit
of
a
belgian
along
with
the
spice
surprisingly
this
beer
is
slightly
tart
at
the
beginning
then
transitions
to
the
classic
belgian
yeast
flavors
the
flavor
ends
rather
abruptly
and
cleanly
lightmedium
mouthfeel
not
a
strong
flavored
beer
nor
heavy
tasting
but
rather
in
my
opinion
a
good
everyday
pedestrian
belgian
white
that
doesnt
go
too
far
drinks
nicely
a
couple
of
these
would
work
nicely
on
a
warm
day
personally
i
would
reach
for
a
hefe
but
this
one
would
appeal
to
many
people
even
bmc
drinkers
a
nice
brew
the
beer
is
a
nice
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
rocky
with
head
the
smell
is
floral
spicy
and
a
touch
of
belgian
yeast
ok
the
taste
is
floral
and
peppery
with
some
big
grassy
notes
the
beer
is
very
dry
and
the
carbonation
is
not
quite
right
the
beer
is
not
hard
to
drink
but
reminds
me
of
chimay
white
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
13
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
wheat
sweet
malt
hops
spice
and
slight
citrus
fits
the
style
of
a
witbier
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
clove
wheat
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
overall
onyl
complaint
is
a
slight
wateriness
to
the
mouth
feel
d
overall
a
good
beer
but
not
one
that
stands
out
for
the
style
ill
take
a
local
like
allagash
white
over
this
any
day
d
easy
drinking
the
5
4
abv
is
masked
well
enough
where
you
dont
even
taste
it
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
this
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
one
away
if
somebody
gave
me
one
d
very
drinkable
and
summery
great
for
grilling
had
mine
with
some
grilled
walleye
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
would
be
nice
to
drink
on
a
summer
day
pretty
good
flavor
for
what
it
is
but
it
is
nothing
to
stop
buying
new
beers
because
of
i
drank
this
without
food
but
could
imagine
it
tasting
great
as
part
of
a
hearty
brunch
perhaps
with
a
spicy
omlette
pours
a
very
nice
pale
with
some
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
great
scent
with
a
nice
semisweet
maltiness
and
a
great
spiciness
some
orange
and
a
nice
slight
pepperiness
excellent
flavor
with
the
same
attributes
as
the
aroma
has
a
very
nice
lasting
quality
that
gives
the
tongue
a
nice
fresh
burst
through
the
end
goes
down
decent
a
very
nice
white
ale
dthis
is
a
very
tasty
brew
big
flavors
and
well
put
together
another
tasty
brew
from
great
lakes
a
very
ok
vitbier
not
worth
drinking
notes
an
awesome
beer
that
i
was
happy
to
have
snagged
a
single
of
now
it
is
available
in
6
packs
around
town
going
to
be
buying
more
when
i
was
a
freshman
in
college
and
hell
even
in
high
school
i
used
to
drink
a
lot
of
blue
moon
when
a
buddy
introduced
me
to
holy
moses
i
was
literallly
blown
away
i
thought
that
this
was
the
greatest
beer
ever
at
the
time
a
couple
months
ago
i
found
a
12
pack
and
was
in
a
very
nostalgic
omg
they
started
bottling
this
again
i
was
trully
giddy
like
a
school
girl
i
have
had
many
more
beers
since
then
and
i
must
say
that
this
beer
is
still
good
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
anymore
i
taste
the
coriander
and
the
orange
peel
but
then
the
rest
is
just
an
american
lager
feel
to
it
honestly
though
it
is
a
good
beer
and
i
think
going
the
blue
moon
route
and
sticking
an
orange
peel
in
it
may
be
worth
it
nonetheless
its
a
great
beer
for
summer
but
no
gumballhead
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
on
the
higher
side
drinkability
is
good
its
a
good
flavored
easy
drinking
beer
the
citrus
flavor
makes
it
pretty
refreshing
and
nice
to
drink
on
this
extremely
hot
day
overall
a
very
refreshing
easy
drinker
from
great
lakes
im
glad
they
brought
this
one
back
fine
witbier
for
hothumid
summer
days
this
is
very
drinkable
and
my
wife
likes
it
too
i
will
have
a
few
of
these
this
summer
md
mouthfeel
is
just
plain
weak
it
slides
down
the
throat
as
aggressively
as
a
sierra
mist
with
as
much
aftertaste
as
well
this
is
a
reasonably
drinkable
beer
however
for
the
price
hoegaarden
and
many
other
better
witbiers
are
available
d
good
clean
very
easy
going
down
this
beer
is
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
though
in
the
end
slightly
boring
a
good
beer
and
well
crafted
but
not
amazing
a
solid
beer
from
a
solid
brewery
poured
a
deep
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
although
just
a
thin
cap
very
nice
head
retention
with
ample
wet
lacings
although
advertised
to
have
a
big
floral
aroma
generally
the
aromas
were
faint
wheat
sweet
citrus
and
a
very
faint
hint
of
coriander
creamy
smooth
feel
with
very
refreshing
carbonation
a
few
different
flavors
are
present
but
none
of
them
dominate
sweet
wheat
malt
beginning
followed
by
light
citrusbanana
flavor
and
a
light
spicycoriander
finish
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
im
a
rookie
to
this
style
so
dont
have
much
for
comparison
expected
more
spice
but
appreciated
it
wasnt
overspiced
which
is
my
experience
with
pumpkin
ales
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
like
today
pours
an
almost
clear
golden
straw
superfine
white
head
smell
is
complex
fruity
and
floral
and
malty
altogether
very
nice
feels
smooth
and
bitter
a
good
backing
intensified
by
chamomile
but
with
a
citrusy
edge
on
the
end
easily
drinkable
quite
good
and
an
excellent
wit
in
its
own
right
d
pretty
solid
overall
it
isnt
my
usual
sort
of
thing
but
great
lakes
pretty
much
nailed
it
for
the
style
all
things
considered
i
thought
this
a
pretty
decent
wit
style
beer
and
one
that
is
perfect
for
drinking
through
the
hot
summer
months
out
here
admitedly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
when
done
right
i
am
a
major
appreciator
i
think
overall
this
is
a
nice
representation
but
is
just
kind
of
average
for
me
ours
a
nice
brighter
cloudy
yellow
with
a
big
head
npse
is
spices
corriander
banana
and
yeast
taste
is
a
milder
synthesis
of
those
that
does
not
overwhelm
but
plays
with
the
tastebuds
finish
is
somewhat
dry
drinkability
isnr
great
for
a
of
these
things
for
me
its
just
ok
overall
the
most
bitter
and
herbal
witbier
ive
had
i
dont
particular
like
this
version
better
than
other
ones
but
holy
moses
is
a
good
beer
d
an
interesting
witbier
offering
from
the
folks
at
great
lakes
much
fuller
and
richer
than
most
of
its
peers
the
chamomile
also
adds
intriguing
character
and
a
certain
soothing
quality
real
easy
drinking
and
a
nice
seasonal
offering
good
tasty
beer
for
warm
weather
nice
wit
not
the
best
ive
had
but
up
there
and
worth
trying
would
be
easy
enough
to
session
pours
a
hazy
yellow
to
goldish
color
with
a
one
finger
head
which
resedes
to
skim
with
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
malt
with
hints
of
banana
and
citrus
the
taste
has
a
wheat
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
citrus
bananas
floral
hops
and
i
detect
a
little
green
apple
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
and
crisp
overall
it
is
a
good
solid
beer
not
the
best
in
its
class
but
a
solid
flavor
that
has
nothing
to
dislike
about
it
you
would
go
back
for
a
second
pours
a
hazy
pale
strawyellow
colour
with
a
nice
white
head
and
spotty
lacing
smells
of
wheat
clove
and
faint
banana
taste
has
a
lot
of
banana
sweetness
to
go
with
the
wheat
flavour
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
are
noticeable
nice
carbonation
level
a
very
refreshing
summer
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
for
a
wit
drinkability
a
hohum
wheat
beer
great
lakes
is
a
great
brewery
and
honestly
i
expected
more
tastes
lightly
peppry
and
mildly
bananaish
moving
into
a
yeastier
spicier
middle
and
ending
on
a
kick
of
straightup
banana
tinged
oj
with
alcohol
and
yeast
lingering
wowzers
i
honestly
dont
remember
ever
having
had
a
tastier
wit
d
very
drinkable
beer
good
for
the
summertime
very
reasonably
priced
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
nicely
retaining
white
head
spotty
lacing
delicious
oranges
clove
and
coriander
in
the
nose
with
a
touch
of
tartness
very
inviting
the
taste
was
a
little
on
the
weaker
side
though
was
looking
for
a
bit
more
flavor
here
but
the
spices
came
through
very
well
a
delicate
bitterness
in
the
finish
holds
the
sweetness
in
check
touch
of
honey
citrus
and
spice
throughout
nicely
carbonated
just
a
slight
prickle
on
the
tongue
with
a
crisp
body
pretty
good
overall
holy
moses
sorry
i
couldnt
resist
this
guy
pours
a
hazy
pale
golden
straw
with
half
a
finger
of
white
foamy
head
on
top
the
smell
is
of
orange
peel
coriander
wheat
banana
clove
and
cracked
pepper
a
slight
yeastiness
is
also
perceptibly
trying
to
squeeze
through
from
beneath
but
to
only
partial
avail
the
taste
is
very
similar
though
the
grains
and
spices
are
more
separated
than
public
facilities
following
plessey
v
ferguson
too
soon
the
first
wave
consists
of
the
wheat
and
orange
peel
the
second
of
coriander
cardamom
pepper
clove
and
even
a
strange
hint
of
salt
the
banana
is
only
mildly
there
as
though
hes
got
somehwere
better
to
be
constantly
looking
at
his
watch
and
tweeting
the
time
away
while
everyone
else
has
the
time
of
their
lives
some
people
yknow
the
body
is
decidedly
medium
with
an
active
carbonation
that
comes
in
briefly
but
strongly
in
a
sudden
burst
of
effervescence
im
not
much
of
a
fan
of
that
but
the
overall
taste
and
effect
keep
the
drinkability
from
being
shredded
by
the
wanton
co2
assault
drinkability
reasonably
well
done
but
not
the
best
in
style
wouldnt
quite
hold
up
to
a
whole
session
but
it
could
be
rotated
in
d
a
very
good
beer
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
buy
every
spring
d
another
good
work
from
great
lakes
makes
for
an
excellent
summer
beer
d
a
nice
refreshing
white
ale
that
produced
pleasant
sweetness
but
balanced
it
out
with
enough
bitterness
holy
moses
looks
good
a
big
bright
yellow
glow
coming
from
the
glass
once
filled
i
mean
this
is
bright
with
some
fainter
white
patches
if
you
imagine
it
the
head
is
thick
ecru
ivory
white
dense
foam
that
looks
scrumptious
in
its
own
right
semi
small
squigglys
going
down
smell
is
pretty
much
on
the
style
big
amounts
of
coriander
slight
clove
wheat
and
some
small
earthy
floral
hops
taste
is
great
this
is
refreshing
to
say
the
least
a
nice
light
sweet
malt
along
with
wheat
and
the
afformentioned
spices
like
i
said
on
par
the
feel
is
smooth
light
easyt
going
inviting
not
complex
beer
in
its
lightest
form
easy
stuff
here
the
drinkability
on
this
is
well
if
they
made
40s
of
this
i
would
buy
them
up
great
stuff
for
the
season
cheers
drinkability
it
goes
down
well
but
i
tend
to
bore
of
the
flavor
after
a
few
of
these
so
i
would
be
ready
to
grab
something
else
i
see
this
being
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
fantastic
plus
an
excellent
representation
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
great
lakes
consistently
produces
incredible
brews
this
is
very
light
but
crisp
a
very
refreshing
beer
should
be
one
of
the
go
to
beers
for
this
summer
ive
got
an
old
friend
back
again
not
my
favourite
great
lakes
offering
due
to
the
slight
misfire
on
the
body
but
still
far
superior
to
most
other
offerings
in
the
field
good
work
fellas
cheers
smooth
and
easy
drinking
d
delicious
and
refreshing
summer
beer
one
of
the
best
witbiers
ive
had
highly
recommended
conclusion
this
was
my
first
gl
brew
i
got
to
try
ef
up
at
an
indian
restaurant
in
kalamazoo
i
must
say
that
was
the
kind
of
quality
i
was
expecting
with
all
the
hype
this
brewery
gets
holy
moses
meh
it
wasnt
bad
but
it
wasnt
memorable
either
10
00
is
definitely
too
much
to
pay
for
a
sixer
of
this
id
rather
have
hoegaarden
or
boulevards
zon
over
this
for
13
bucks
less
overall
quite
a
decent
example
of
a
belgian
style
wit
and
a
very
nice
summer
beer
though
i
know
it
isnt
the
same
style
this
is
often
compared
to
oberon
in
the
parts
where
i
live
and
i
will
say
i
prefer
this
over
oberon
overall
its
an
interesting
beer
not
one
that
i
would
think
about
ordering
alot
but
it
was
good
deff
a
nice
seasonal
spring
beer
light
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
received
as
a
congraduations
for
good
grades
this
semseter
and
drank
after
a
large
meal
at
chipolte
it
will
be
the
first
of
maybe
beers
a
rate
this
summer
the
few
glbc
brews
i
have
had
i
have
found
to
be
oustanding
this
one
was
good
but
a
notch
below
the
first
four
ive
had
dortmunder
ness
fitzgerald
and
burning
river
drinkability
the
high
carbonation
does
a
great
thing
when
the
beer
is
drank
with
a
meal
it
cleans
the
palate
completely
when
i
had
this
in
a
shaker
pint
i
think
i
got
more
of
the
flavor
but
overall
i
find
this
is
a
one
a
time
beer
it
is
refreshing
and
goes
great
with
a
meal
and
maybe
even
for
savoring
slowly
but
just
one
after
that
im
done
im
not
complaining
mind
you
its
good
just
not
give
me
another
one
right
now
or
i
wish
this
would
never
end
good
nicely
quaffable
too
safe
to
be
mentioned
in
the
same
sentence
as
beers
like
st
bs
and
allagash
white
id
like
to
see
them
kick
this
up
a
notch
drinkability
quite
a
good
beer
and
overall
i
really
like
it
great
lakes
has
yet
to
let
me
down
the
only
thing
that
i
found
to
be
a
bit
of
a
downer
is
the
slight
metallic
twinge
in
it
but
thats
easy
to
get
by
considering
all
the
other
great
aspects
the
abv
is
pretty
moderate
at
5
4
so
its
not
as
if
this
beer
is
going
to
get
you
hammered
so
one
could
easily
get
through
a
couple
with
little
to
no
problem
md
very
creamy
texture
but
still
very
easy
to
drink
nice
balance
of
good
flavor
and
refreshment
d
an
easy
drinking
witbier
although
it
is
a
little
on
the
mild
side
well
made
and
worth
trying
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
i
would
definatly
try
again
and
think
it
would
be
a
great
beer
to
drink
in
the
summer
d
definitely
a
good
easy
drinking
white
ale
i
would
drink
this
again
rather
lightbodied
and
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
nice
warm
weather
brew
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
couple
inches
of
white
head
it
is
gold
with
suspended
yeast
the
aroma
is
banana
and
clove
maybe
some
lemon
the
taste
is
much
the
same
it
has
a
medium
body
it
is
very
refreshing
it
is
another
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
taste
is
very
fruity
and
bready
lots
of
light
sweet
malt
but
very
smooth
and
wheaty
mouthfeel
is
full
and
crisp
real
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
d
very
good
even
for
the
style
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
holy
moses
i
wasnt
overly
excited
to
see
it
back
in
the
lineup
but
it
is
clearly
better
than
than
grassroots
ale
to
be
fair
im
not
much
of
a
witbier
fan
in
terms
of
style
theres
nothing
wrong
with
holy
moses
but
it
still
seems
rather
underwhelming
in
terms
of
overall
flavor
it
is
easy
drinking
and
would
make
for
a
nice
beer
on
a
hot
day
but
its
not
something
id
drink
regularly
if
youre
into
witbiers
give
it
a
try
if
not
youll
probably
view
it
like
i
do
meh
i
am
pleased
to
see
grassroots
ale
out
of
the
rotation
for
the
moment
just
sayin
im
trying
not
to
overrate
this
one
but
its
simply
too
good
to
ignore
the
style
is
generally
not
my
first
choice
but
its
performed
extremely
well
here
with
alternating
excitement
and
balance
probably
the
best
wit
ive
ever
tasted
and
the
best
one
made
in
america
d
very
drinkable
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
many
of
these
on
a
warm
night
on
the
patio
delicious
and
smooth
another
very
solid
offering
from
great
lakes
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
an
average
amount
of
carbonation
the
body
is
not
too
thick
fairly
light
definitely
easy
to
drink
something
that
goes
down
easily
on
a
warm
spring
day
i
love
all
of
great
lakes
offerings
and
this
is
no
exception
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
but
have
to
say
this
brew
is
not
bad
at
all
goes
down
super
quick
and
easy
and
has
a
nice
taste
that
hangs
on
for
just
the
right
amount
of
time
definetly
worth
a
try
if
ya
see
it
an
odd
mouthfeel
for
a
wit
mild
carbonation
level
poured
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
modest
head
that
quickly
faded
to
a
collar
the
aroma
is
wheaty
banana
the
taste
is
surprisingly
lemony
citrus
with
a
banana
background
feel
is
just
barely
medium
bodied
with
a
tiny
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
you
can
pound
these
suckers
this
is
a
solid
wit
and
well
worth
a
try
great

holy

pours
a
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
citrusy
the
flavor
is
also
spicy
and
citrusy
in
classic
wit
fashion
this
is
one
of
the
better
wit
beers
that
ive
had
definitely

a

light

with
a
spicy
flair
and
fairly
substantial

for
the
style
i
have
been
consistently
impressed
with
great
lakes
recently
it
was
a
nice
color
for
a
white
ale
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
white
as
maybe
i
had
thought
it
would
be
more
of
a
yellowish
tint
to
it
it
was
a
great
beer
it
smelled
just
like
any
other
witbier
ive
had
but
the
interesting
spicey
flavors
and
the
chamomile
that
i
swore
i
could
taste
gave
it
some
interesting
initial
and
aftertastes
over
all
i
think
it
was
a
great
beer
and
as
always
a
nice
story
from
great
lakes
a
cloudy
pale

color
pour
with
a
thick
fluffy

that
lasted
quite
a

some

has
all
of
the

of
the
aroma
but
is
stronger
on

and
has
some
orange

in
there
as

hoppy
bitterness
is
noticable

this
is
a
darn
good
brewtoo
bad
they
have
retired
it
an
easy
drinking
wit
from

though
the
flavor
tends
to
be
a
bit
washed
out

drinkable

looks
good
with

bravo
as
far
as
a
wheat

go
this
is
a
unique
in
it

this
is
not

drinkability
as
usual
another
solid
beer
from
great
lakes
i
often
forget
just
how
good
these
guys
are
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
from
pour
to
aroma
to
tasting
and
finishing
i
drank
this
in
the
colder
part
of
the
irish
winter
and
it
went
down
well
and
i
could
imagine
that
it
would
be
nice
on
a
summer
day
too
ill
definitely
recommend
this
and
try
it
againwell
done
great
lakes
brewing
co
pours
a
cloudy
light
gold
in
color
frothy
ring
of
head
settles
around
the
perimeter
of
the
glass
initial
smell
is
yeast
and
spice
theres
a
lot
more
spice
in
the
flavor
some
bittering
hops
and
sharp
spices
not
a
whole
lot
of
fruit
flavor
but
some
floral
notes
are
present
a
little
thin
in
mouthfeel
but
its
refreshing
and
clean
d
very
enjoyable
its
a
shame
this
brew
will
become
only
seasonal
but
then
again
its
one
to
look
forward
to
d
i
thought
the
strong
chamomile
made
this
a
winner
for
me
i
just
love
that
clean
floral
grassy
nose
and
flavor
just
smelling
it
makes
me
feel
calm
i
found
it
quite
drinkable
id
really
like
to
try
it
in
the
summer
seems
a
perfect
drink
for
a
hot
day
witbier
is
not
my
first
choice
in
style
but
i
am
going
to
revisit
this
one
for
sure
great
lakes
really
does
have
a
well
rounded
menu
of
offerings
at
this
point
in
time
damn
theres
all
kinds
of
flavor
right
off
from
when
it
first
touches
the
lips
lemony
bite
backed
up
with
a
fresh
out
of
the
banana
bread
like
warmth
in
the
middle
there
a
crisp
and
bold
spiciness
courtesy
of
the
coriander
and
especially
the
chamomile
which
add
a
very
interesting
complexity
to
the
brew
not
overly
sweet
like
a
lot
of
the
american
takes
can
be
nor
that
almost
artificial
citrus
flavoring
taste
that
a
lot
of
them
have
the
mouth
feel
is
full
and
fluffy
not
thin
fizzy
but
not
superthick
either
it
finishes
clean
and
just
a
slight
sweet
tang
pours
a
beautifully
white
color
probably
one
of
the
truly
whitest
beer
ive
ever
had
has
a
very
impressive
frothy
white
head
that
bubbles
around
with
a
texture
a
lot
like
whipped
cream
very
hazy
unfiltered
look
to
it
light
clean
orange
and
grains
of
paradise
aroma
with
a
little
pepperiness
to
it
very
german
flavor
to
it
for
a
belgian
style
especially
with
the
big
frothy
head
reminds
me
of
sitting
at
bars
during
the
summer
in
berlin
extrordinarily
dry
base
for
the
spices
with
a
crisp
finish
a
little
clove
like
yeast
flavor
like
a
hefe
pretty
complex
but
not
overly
delicious
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
from
the
wheat
and
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
since
its
so
light
you
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
but
im
still
looking
for
a
little
more
flavor
like
you
find
in
a
good
hefeweizen
or
belgian
wit
maybe
a
little
more
alcohol
or
a
little
sweetness
either
from
the
yeast
or
from
a
little
higher
mash
temp
still
a
nice
beer
i
thought
it
was
funny
how
the
side
of
the
label
said
it
was
made
from
barley
hops
yeast
and
water
but
elsewhere
on
the
label
it
said
it
included
spices
and
chamomile
d
an
easy
session
beer
worth
trying
every
so
often
mostly
clear
with
a
careful
pour
but
its
not
necessary
to
avoid
the
sediment
not
off
tastes
there
just
stronger
mediumlight
gold
with
a
mediumsized
pillowy
white
slowlydiminishing
head
smells
of
fruit
followed
closely
behind
by
bready
malt
and
yeast
and
some
very
light
spice
taste
is
of
light
crisp
fruity
citrus
up
front
with
a
spicy
finish
coriander
then
clove
it
has
a
mediumlight
body
slightly
creamy
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
this
is
one
of
the
brewerys
best
offerings
definitely
worth
a
try
d
i
could
drink
tons
only
if
it
was
fresh
poured
a
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
whisps
of
yeasty
dirst
swirling
around
and
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
glass
the
small
and
foamy
white
head
didnt
stick
around
for
long
the
sweet
nose
is
full
of
yeast
orange
and
belgianlike
spices
fairly
straightforward
but
there
is
an
odd
harsh
wheat
flavor
to
it
and
i
dont
believe
it
to
be
bitterness
from
the
hops
perhaps
this
is
over
spiced
for
some
people
but
i
still
find
it
pleasant
and
semirefreshing
slick
but
moderate
feel
with
a
lot
of
tingly
carbonation
feels
like
your
drinking
an
alka
seltzer
drink
fairly
drinkable
but
kinda
weird
d
5
4
makes
it
decently
sessionable
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
12
oz
bottle
pours

color
with
a
fizzy
white

aroma
is

grapefruit

and
maybe
a
hint
of
grain
flavor
is
sweet
initially
with
a
slight
bitter
finish
light
on
the
palate
and
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
pours
the
typical
ghostly
pale
orange
witbier
color
has
a
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
thin
yet
rocky
cap
the
aroma
is
very
nice
good
belgian
yeast
aromas
banana
and
light
pepper
coriander
spice
some
candi
sugar
aromas

well
the
taste
has

aroma

is

on

bitterness
is
noticable
in
the
end
the
feel
is
light
and
well
carbonation
finishes
balanced
starts
off
sweet
and
ends
bitter
this
is
a
great
witbier
as
it
is
not
dominated
by
coriander
and
orange
peel
which
i
prefer
flavors
are
pretty
much
spot
on
with
an
added
hoppiness
in
the
end
d
a
very
refreshing
beer
ideal
for
a
hot
summer
day
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
it
seems
very
true
to
the
style
much
bettermore
complex
than
a
basic
wheat
beer
might
be
difficult
to
pass
off
on
a
bmc
drinker
unlike
a
regular
wheat
recommended
d
a
damn
good
witbier
great
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
d
very
high
i
could
drink
this
all
day
notes
one
of
the
more
drinkable
glbc
beers
now
this
is
pretty
hoppy
for
a
white
ale
nice
beer
overall
it
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
of
smallish
bubbles
that
retain
well
and
form
a
nice
lacing
the
color
is
yellowish
orange
and
very
cloudy
the
nose
is
subtle
orange
and
on
the
palate
the
first
impression
is
the
lively
carbonation
bite
followed
immediately
by
orange
spiced
with
coriander
but
with
an
appreciable
hop
bitterness
the
hops
general
dryness
and
high
carbonation
join
forces
to
help
this
one
to
finish
very
crisply
with
a
pleasant
clean
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
has
a
great
balance
between
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
low
abv
i
can
see
myself
putting
a
few
of
these
away
on
sunny
humid
afternoon
overlooking
a
large
body
of
water
a
beer
for
the
mix
drink
makers
its
too
sweet
for
my
blood
for
some
reason
t
having
just
drank
a
hoegaarden
before
this
beer
my
opinion
and
score
of
it
suffer
a
little
by
direct
comparison
this
is
a
great
witbier
but
comes
up
a
little
thinner
and
little
more
spicy
than
the
hoegaarden
and
just
isnt
as
enjoyable
strong
with
orange
and
lemon
flavors
with
a
spicy
background
not
quite
as
much
of
a
wheat
or
yeast
flavor
as
the
hoegaarden
very
refreshing
pleasant
take
on
witbier
but
not
my
favorite
glbc
beer
great
lakes
has
yet
to
let
me
down
so
i
picked
up
a
few
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
pours
a
cloudy
yelloworange
color
with
a
thick
head
that
dwindles
down
powerful
carbonation
and
some
really
great
lacing
as
well
in
the
glass
this
beer
almost
looks
like
honey
the
aroma
is
thick
with
coriander
and
citrus
fruits
i
also
picked
up
some
bitterness
from
the
aroma
i
let
the
head
die
down
before
i
took
my
first
sip
this
beer
feels
crisp
and
pleasant
overall
good
citrus
flavors
complimented
by
spices
the
first
one
i
had
on
its
own
and
my
second
one
had
a
slice
of
fresh
lemon
both
ways
were
good
but
the
lemon
really
added
to
the
overall
flavor
i
recommend
trying
a
few
of
these
make
sure
they
are
cold
and
you
will
enjoy
one
seriously
refreshing
witbier
note
that
nectarine
taste
becomes
stronger
as
you
work
your
way
through
this
beer
and
its
pretty
cool
to
taste
but
the
tea
like
flavors
sort
of
dull
my
overall
interest
in
this
beer
ps
high
carbonation
which
can
be
a
bit
prickely
at
low
temperatures
light
on
body
big
on
flavor
this
is
highly
drinkable
for
any
occasion
imo
playing
18
holes
bring
a
sixer
along
just
want
a
sipper
on
a
quiet
evening
go
for
it
d
this
is
a
perfect
summer
beer
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
easily
d
another
great
beer
from
great
lakes
i
dont
know
if
i
would
buy
just
a
sixer
of
this
for
8
50
but
getting
the
12
bottle
variety
pack
with
burning
rivereliot
ness
and
edmund
fitzgerald
for
12
99
was
an
absolute
steal
i
could
easily
see
enjoying
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
night
with
friends
not
as
good
as
some
other
wits
ive
had
but
really
quite
drinkable
notes
this
is
one
of
the
more
complex
witbiers
that
i
have
tried
so
far
it
also
had
a
nice
calming
effect
on
me
that
after
a
long
day
of
work
it
must
have
been
the
chamomile
well
done
i
will
need
to
get
some
more
of
this
ale
very
drinkable
i
will
probably
grab
a
case
of
this
this
poured
a
hazy
cloudy
yellow
color
with
foamy
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
slowly
aroma
is
citrusy
and
spicey
flavor
is
also
of
citrus
and
spice
mediumbodied
and
smooth
this
is
a
noncomplex
but
refreshing
witbier
that
i
enjoyed
good
summer
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
and
its
very
fresh
i
wish
i
had
access
to
more
of
it
thanks
bill
not
a
white
ale
i
plan
on
going
back
to
average
at
best
did
pair
well
with
a
slightly
spicy
curry
style
dish
d
really
good
and
enjoyable
d
good
drinkability
goes
down
easily
and
is
pretty
refreshing
drinkability
a
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
quaff
wit
definite
summertime
session
beer
d
a
great
session
beer
good
for
summer
times
very
easy
to
drink
personal
note
my
900th
review
great
beer
i
had
a
few
d
this
brew
has
grown
on
me
i
enjoy
it
and
it
is
easy
to
drink
another
winner
from
great
lakes
i
find
this
an
extra
relaxing
beer
to
drink
maybe
because
it
recalls
summer
or
maybe
because
the
tea
is
imparting
some
good
vibes
into
this
or
could
be
a
placebo
effect
regardless
i
like
this
and
will
revisit
periodically
this
summer
since
the
price
is
right
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
the
texas
summers
if
only
we
could
get
it
here
d
a
nice
drinkability
due
to
a
nice
combination
of
taste
and
mouthfeel
a
little
overcarbonated
but
still
a
decent
drinkabilty
worth
a
session
if
you
can
get
it
dgreat
flavor
and
aroma
but
bodys
overall
light
nature
offbalances
the
mix
it
is
just
a
bit
too
light
to
carry
the
beers
bright
character
still
a
good
drink
smooth
and
delicious
d
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
the
craft
movement
nice
soft
flavors
make
for
a
great
warm
weather
beer
ive
had
it
in
the
summer
and
in
the
winter
and
its
more
appreciable
when
the
mercury
rises
the
drawback
however
is
that
i
drink
it
too
fast
to
appreciate
the
flavor
this
is
a
really
nice
interpretation
of
the
belgian
white
ale
style
beer
pours
a
decent
head
with
crisp
carbonation
smells
of
corriander
lemon
and
wheat
the
aftertaste
sometimes
lingers
a
bit
in
a
strange
way
this
is
the
only
drawback
but
it
is
a
clean
smooth
crisp
refreshing
brew
tastes
of
citrusy
fruit
and
spices
really
great
summer
beer
holy
moses
great
name
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
faint
greenish
tint
to
it
a
fluffy
white
head
fades
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
bright
and
lemony
with
yeast
and
banana
the
tast
is
light
and
lemony
with
some
sour
and
bitter
fighting
each
other
in
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
high
and
spritzy
with
fits
this
beer
well
with
a
mediumlight
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
i
wasnt
inspired
to
reach
for
another
like
i
stated
earlier
i
was
expecting
a
normal
witbier
but
the
darker
surprise
was
awesome
i
will
definitely
be
buying
these
again
uhh
i
wonder
if
anyone
here
has
ever
had
chamomile
tea
because
if
you
have
its
what
you
can
expect
in
this
beer
beyond
the
typical
characteristics
of
the
style
the
beer
is
interesting
but
way
way
too
much
like
chamomile
tea
like
someone
dropped
a
teabag
into
a
runofthemill
witbier
otherwise
this
beer
is
pretty
good
but
i
couldnt
get
past
the
overinterpretiveness
needs
more
of
a
citrus
kick
less
bitterness
a
very
nice
beer
when
compared
to
hoegaarden
this
has
slightly
more
body
and
flavor
i
think
this
is
a
really
excellent
interpretation
of
the
style
this
will
be
a
great
summer
session
beer
d
it
is
drinkable
in
the
same
way
that
bud
is
drinkable
it
is
smooth
and
not
really
there
i
would
definitely
not
look
for
this
one
again
and
have
to
say
that
overall
this
is
so
far
my
least
favorite
of
all
of
the
gl
beers
that
i
have
had
usually
this
brewery
makes
me
want
more
and
more
but
here
they
leave
me
not
wanting
another
one
at
all
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
and
the
carbonation
seems
to
be
slightly
low
for
a
wit
dry
finish
really
dry
clean
crisp
and
citrusy
certainly
this
is
a
wonderful
session
type
beer
perfect
for
summer
like
most
wit
beers
not
sure
if
i
would
totally
recommend
this
as
there
are
plenty
out
there
just
as
good
or
better
overall
slightly
above
average
overall
ill
admit
its
been
a
while
since
ive
had
a
belgian
wit
so
perhaps
my
palates
a
bit
off
however
the
bjcp
guidelines
seem
to
confirm
my
general
thoughts
that
this
beer
is
too
bitter
and
lacks
the
sweet
citrus
notes
generally
associated
with
witbier
i
fear
that
an
american
witbiera
neutered
more
pilslike
version
of
a
witbieris
developing
just
as
the
boring
american
hefeweizen
developed
here
in
the
states
holy
moses
is
a
good
beer
on
its
own
but
it
lacks
the
uniqueness
that
generally
leads
me
to
choose
a
wit
over
a
pale
lager
pours
an
ohsoslightly
fogged
straw
with
a
decent
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lace
on
the
way
down
nose
is
citrus
and
funky
and
even
though
it
doesnt
show
a
lot
of
spice
i
think
its
what
you
expect
from
the
style
flavor
has
a
pretty
good
body
decent
level
of
funk
mixed
with
a
vibrant
citrus
edge
the
only
detracting
feature
is
its
lack
of
staying
power
it
seems
to
fade
just
a
bit
quicker
than
it
should
feel
is
good
overall
though
there
is
a
biting
edge
that
detracts
from
things
i
have
to
say
and
also
it
seems
to
lack
a
balance
that
would
make
it
easier
to
drink
overall
it
is
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
from
an
american
brewery
dnotes
in
my
opinion
the
best
american
witbier
flavorfull
filling
but
highly
drinkable
a
perfect
take
on
the
style
well
balanced
an
excellently
consistent
thread
in
great
lakes
brewing
company
beers
d
on
the
whole
not
bad
i
would
drink
this
under
the
right
circumstances
but
it
would
not
be
a
go
to
beer
d
light
would
make
a
nice
brew
for
a
hot
day
goes
down
very
easy
overall
a
pleasing
belgian
style
overall
this
was
a
classic
witbier
with
a
really
nice
little
twist
at
the
end
i
am
loving
all
these
great
lakes
brews
i
have
been
able
to
get
up
here
they
are
really
great
quality
and
this
one
ws
no
exception
a
really
quality
little
ale
here
i
would
definitly
try
again
d
good
beer
nice
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
theres
a
lot
going
on
with
the
flavor
but
it
works
well
and
tastes
great
moreys
bottom
line
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
smooth
from
start
to
finish
with
nice
citris
notes
and
would
definitely
recommend
it
to
fans
of
the
style
as
it
is
probably
my
favorite
witiber
to
date
poured
this
from
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
with
a
ton
of
information
about
the
beer
printed
on
the
label
very
light
yellow
color
with
a
significant
amount
of
haze
nice
fluffy
head
that
leaves
plenty
of
lace
all
along
the
glass
head
is
a
little
darker
than
pure
white
but
very
close
smell
is
of
citrus
wheat
and
spices
lemon
and
orange
are
most
noticeable
taste
is
very
refreshing
nice
citrus
zing
with
an
abundance
of
spice
lighter
body
and
ample
carbonation
this
seems
like
a
perfect
beer
to
be
enjoyed
during
the
spring
or
summer
though
im
digging
it
in
the
middle
of
winter
another
excellent
find
at
pizza
plant
holy
moses
is
very
smooth
a
mellow
accompaniment
on
a
sunny
very
cold
day
the
body
is
cloudy
and
a
very
light
golden
one
of
the
lighter
colored
beers
i
can
rememberjust
a
shade
darker
than
hoegaarden
but
isnt
everything
two
fingers
of
white
foam
top
off
the
pint
glass
but
the
head
isnt
as
durable
as
one
might
suspect
from
first
glance
the
smell
and
flavor
are
a
wonderful
amalgam
of
fruit
and
spice
with
banana
grapefruit
and
orange
comingling
with
ginger
coriander
and
a
dash
of
pepper
the
carbonation
is
a
little
light
for
me
but
the
smooth
taste
make
this
beer
all
too
easy
to
drink
really
good
find
something
id
like
to
try
on
a
hot
summer
day
six
months
from
now
the
head
and
the
flavor
fades
too
quickly
in
this
beer
it
really
leaves
you
unsatisfied
and
wishing
the
flavor
would
stick
around
just
a
little
longer
great
beer
for
spring
i
wish
i
could
bring
this
beer
to
boston
it
would
easily
put
harpoon
ufo
to
shame
all
and
all
a
good
beer
the
earthy
tones
in
the
flavor
just
didnt
thrill
me
but
otherwise
a
solid
wit
just
good
certainly
not
great
pours
a
cloudy
golden
nice
white

with
very
good

weak

just
a
bit
of

taste
is
of
sweet
fruitcloveand
spice
on
the
light
sidebut
smoothand
refreshing
very
good
i
only
bought
one
but
could
surely
go
through
three
or
four
in
a
night
4
5
on
the
mouthfeel
as
the
spice
is
lingering
nut
not
stick
tounge
causing
good
beer
d
a
good
brew
within
the
style
reminiscent
of
batch
8000
if
i
have
a
hankerin
for
a
witwhich
is
very
and
far
between
ill
most
likely
reach
for
one
of
these
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
very
likable
beer
in
a
very
quaffable
style
ill
take
all
i
can
get
extra
points
for
an
amusing
label
i
believe
moses
is
parting
lake
erie
and
cleveland
is
the
promised
land
i
left
the
sediment
in
the
bottle
when
i
decanted
this
there
was
an
initial
chill
haze
in
this
strawgolden
beer
that
became
clear
after
several
minutes
nose
has
some
sweet
bready
aromas
and
hints
of
spice
and
resiny
orange
taste
is
a
nice
balance
of
light
doughy
malt
sweetness
with
a
spicy
crisp
finish
light
in
body
with
a
chewy
mouthfeel
this
is
very
sessionable
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
pale
and
wheat
malt
scent
there
is
a
faint
scent
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
but
much
less
than
most
wits
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
watery
wheat
malt
flavor
with
some
spices
and
orange
peel
in
the
finish
its
much
lighter
than
most
it
has
a
mild
citrus
element
as
well
as
a
weak
belgian
wit
yeast
presence
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
also
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
really
average
wit
its
real
plain
and
uninteresting
d
quite
good
sessionable
for
sure
drinkability
this
is
a
light
summertime
beer
nothing
objectionable
refreshing
and
unfilling
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
around
served
with
an
orange
that
has
some
of
the
lacing
stick
to
the
side
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
almost
non
existent
at
first
pour
after
warming
up
a
bit
i
was
able
to
notice
some
spices
taste
is
yeasty
with
some
belgian
type
spices
such
as
clove
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
highly
carbonated
for
a
nice
texture
of
the
light
flavors
and
strong
mouthfeel
creating
a
nice
balance
probably
the
best
witbier
ive
had
good
for
a
beer
thats
not
anywhere
near
my
favorite
style
one
of
my
favorite
beers
drinkability
awesome
this
is
the
perfect
summer
quencher
full
of
flavor
and
pleasant
finish
i
could
picture
myself
working
out
on
a
field
somewhere
being
eternally
gratefull
for
a
gallon
of
this
stuff
to
pass
the
hours
seek
it
out
and
give
it
a
try
drinkability
could
do
two
in
a
night
but
not
back
to
back
pours
a
nice
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
mild
head
hardly
any
aroma
to
it
at
all
some
citrusy
hoppiness
to
it
but
no
malt
tastes
good
oranges
are
first
noticeable
with
a
more
predominate
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
average
a
bit
watery
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
all
around
pours
a
clean
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
nose
it
was
floral
and
czech
hop
presence
in
the
taste
sweet
and
a
bit
yeasty
and
presence
of
a
standard
wheat
beer
it
is
a
bit
dry
in
the
mouth
yet
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
a
decent
summer
beer
however
i
still
am
not
that
partial
to
wheat
beers
in
general
drinkability
an
excellent
summer
beer
really
hit
the
spot
after
a
90
degree
day
pours
a
nice
light
yellow
copper
straw
color
with
soem
light
head
and
lacing
nose
is
citrus
some
spices
nothing
much
else
taste
is
solid
refreshing
wheat
and
orange
flavors
its
pretty
standard
for
a
witbier
actually
although
not
bad
body
is
a
little
thin
but
good
on
carbonation
this
one
was
by
no
means
bad
but
it
was
certainly
nothing
particularly
interesting
from
a
brewer
that
does
a
lot
of
things
better
id
stick
with
the
edmund
fitzgerald
or
elliot
ness
from
the
tap
the
brew
proved
to
be
somewhat
of
a
disapointment
upon
the
delivery
of
the
beer
i
noticed
a
clearerthannormal
opaquness
and
fizziness
that
i
had
not
noticed
in
the
beer
before
aromas
are
as
soft
malty
spicy
and
fruityfresh
as
i
remembered
the
flavors
however
seemed
off
getting
into
lager
territory
and
not
the
delicate
citrus
flavors
that
i
expect
instead
a
medium
tart
apple
flavor
mixed
with
cereal
grains
and
pilner
malts
flavored
the
brew
the
mouthfeel
was
also
off
not
the
velvety
airy
dry
clean
texture
i
wanted
but
a
carbonated
scrubbed
feel
that
left
a
grain
flavor
in
the
finish
not
that
i
was
a
bad
beer
but
it
was
not
a
good
wit
very
drinkable
i
burned
through
the
six
fast
i
dont
have
this
by
the
case
at
my
store
but
i
will
be
heading
back
for
another
6er
asap
i
meant
to
drink
the
rest
of
this
during
entourage
but
looking
down
at
my
glass
i
see
its
time
for
another
beer
a
nice
wit
to
have
esp
on
a
hot
day
light
citrus
bitterness
up
front
mellow
honey
wheat
bread
and
mildly
sweet
fruit
notes
some
straw
flavor
too
becomes
yeastier
with
citrus
and
spice
taking
over
not
too
spicy
though
finish
is
long
and
yeasty
with
zesty
citrus
and
lingering
mild
fruitcake
notes
mediumbodied
with
a
creamy
wheat
protein
feel
nice
eventempered
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
refreshing
beer
a
very
nice
wit
and
will
make
a
fine
choice
for
summer
evenings
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
im
a
big
fan
of
the
witbier
and
this
doesnt
disappoint

a
nice
pure

foamy
head
with
good

and
some
lacing
aroma
of
coriander

dominant
and
refreshing
taste
consists
of
a
good

with

nice
dose
of
wheat
coriander
and
some

refreshing
with
a
full
body
for
the
style
well
done
and
stays
within
the
style
overall
this
is
a
decent
belgian
white
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
perhaps
not
my
favorite
like
most
wheat
beers
its
a
great
thirstquencher
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
i
could
drink
anywhere
between
one
and
ten
of
these
and
have
a
good
time
regardless
always
up
for
a
new
witte
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
gold
with
a
dissappointing
1
head
nothing
too
impressive
especially
for
the
style
smell
is
sweet
clover
honey
and
black
tea
not
picking
up
much
spice
taste
is
a
bit
shocking
the
honey
is
there
but
there
is
a
good
bit
of
bitterness
keeping
it
from
becoming
too
sweet
its
not
that
the
taste
is
bad
but
maybe
too
strong
for
such
a
sessionable
style
this
competes
with
the
high
carbonation
making
this
feel
heavier
than
it
probably
should
not
what
i
want
when
reaching
for
a
witbier
not
a
repeat
purchase
pours
to
a
light
golden
color
with
white
head
that
lingered
well
and
left
okay
lacing
okay
aroma
of
spices
mostly
corriander
with
a
hint
of
clove
though
the
aroma
was
definitely
underwhelming
flavor
was
slightly
spicy
slightly
doughy
but
not
strong
enough
to
write
home
about
although
it
had
a
somewhat
tingly
mouthfeel
the
finish
seemed
a
little
stale
cardboardlike
and
not
real
long
poured
out
a
light
yellow
see
piss
color
with
a
white
head
that
disapeared
instantly
no
lacing
the
nose
was
dominated
by
banana
and
spice
shockingly
the
taste
was
banana
and
spice
as
well
through
this
all
you
could
detect
some
slightly
harsh
alcohol
had
a
medium
body
with
low
carbonation
and
a
slightly
creamy
finish
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
filling
at
all
excellent
representation
of
style
i
can
see
myself
drinking
quite
a
few
these
yet
another
very
good
beer
from
great
lakes
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
mostly
yeasty
and
doughy
with
a
hint
of
orange
the
bottle
claims
that
it
is
spiced
with
orange
peel
coriander
and
chamomile
the
taste
is
big
upfront
with
witbier
characteristics
with
a
bitter
bite
that
lingers
throughout
the
citrus
comes
through
towards
the
end
with
the
bitter
bite
this
one
is
a
different
witbier
but
still
comes
through
with
the
usual
characteristics
the
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
decent
balance
and
good
carbonation
this
one
is
not
the
best
session
beer
as
far
as
wits
go
for
me
but
it
is
one
that
is
tasty
enough
to
have
a
few
creamy
and
crisp
at
once
this
fills
the
mouth
and
then
leaves
it
cleanfeeling
this
is
without
a
doubt
the
most
drinkable
american
witbier
ive
tried
to
date
i
shouldnt
have
waited
so
long
to
come
back
to
this
one
an
easy
to
drink
wit
overall
i
enjoyed
this
brew
very
much
well
rounded
brew
in
flavor
and
aroma
smooth
and
crisp
makes
it
a
good
summer
ale
enjoy
tastes
are
the
same
with
the
addition
of
hints
of
belgian
yeast
coriander
and
maybe
some
other
spices
at
times
it
seems
to
drift
into
saison
territory
nice
beer
good
for
warm
weather
not
super
complex
but
its
a
good
and
flavorful
wit
solid
4s
d
overall
nothing
spectacular
but
still
a
solid
witbier
i
probably
wont
pick
up
a
sixer
just
because
id
rather
try
a
new
brew
but
still
solid
wellbalanced
clean
crisp
easy
to
drink
this
makes
my
anticipation
for
deckweather
even
higher
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
cap
soft
wheat
notes
are
surrounded
by
coriander
chamomile
florals
yeastiness
and
citric
grassy
notes
smooth
creamy
mouthfeel
with
larger
carbonation
fizz
midway
through
the
swill
prominent
spice
level
coriander
is
pretty
zesty
and
even
a
little
hot
interesting
chamomile
addition
gives
it
some
pungent
earthy
herbal
tea
character
notes
of
bitter
hops
citric
lemon
and
underlying
dryness
rounds
out
the
taste
nicely
the
finish
is
earthy
and
dry
with
notes
that
are
floral
perfumy
and
a
little
oily
on
the
palate
pretty
bold
characters
here
not
shy
on
flavors
the
pungent
spice
and
herbal
level
is
very
enjoyable
but
after
two
of
three
id
have
to
switch
up
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
with
a
bestby
date
of
73007
pours
a
cloudy
straw
color
great
retention
on
the
white
head
smells
very
heavily
of
spices
coriander
orange
peel
overall
very
leafy
and
savory
quality
same
with
the
tastes
very
leafy
and
herbal
a
lot
of
complex
spices
medium
mouthfeel
overall
i
think
this
is
quite
a
good
beer
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
witbier
style
but
i
think
this
is
a
fine
example
of
it
had
this
on
tap
at
the
pizza
plant
on
mainpoured
a
hazed
lighter
straw
color
with
just
a
thin
wispy
head
that
was
gone
quickly
leaving
nothing
left
on
top
quite
spiced
in
the
nose
big
coriander
with
a
touch
of
phenolic
clove
the
citric
element
to
seemed
to
take
a
back
seat
but
it
was
noticable
enoughfull
mouthfeel
for
the
style
this
is
a
pretty
sturdy
wit
beer
well
rounded
flavors
between
the
spice
and
orangelike
flavors
with
that
phenolic
yeast
spiciness
coming
thru
for
a
long
finish
a
good
take
on
the
style
while
iam
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
a
wit
beer
can
go
down
well
after
a
long
day
at
work
like
yesterdayto
me
this
is
a
slightly
beefed
up
version
of
the
style
the
obvious
tastes
of
corriander
white
pepper
and
orange
are
predominant
a
very
pleasent
sweetness
from
the
orange
peel
when
it
first
soaks
the
tongue
very
filling
in
the
mouth
but
not
chewy
finishes
off
with
a
nice
hoppiness
and
smoothness
this
is
a
very
good
beer
in
my
opinion
and
true
contender
for
blue
moon
or
the
likes
drank
it
before
will
drink
it
again
good
stuff
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
shaker
glass
appears
a
cloudy
pale
golden
yellow
with
about
half
an
inch
of
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
spicy
yeast
citrus
fruit
coriander
tastes
of
peppery
wheat
clove
coriander
and
a
hint
of
orange
crisp
and
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
is
a
beer
i
look
forward
to
having
again
when
the
weather
gets
a
little
warmer
a
nice
sessionable
wit
frankly
this
beer
shocked
me
it
was
kind
of
a
random
pick
at
the
store
just
as
something
new
to
try
but
its
difficult
for
me
to
find
fault
with
it
this
beer
will
certainly
keep
my
penchant
for
wheat
beers
going
holy
moses
drinkability
refreshing
and
very
well
made
cheers
really
really
pale
i
would
say
cloudy
but
since
its
so
close
to
being
clear
who
really
knows
nice
yeast
aroma
can
almost
smell
the
fresh
baked
bread
the
taste
was
weak
nothing
stood
out
no
citrus
no
spice
no
nothing
way
better
beers
out
there
that
said
its
really
easy
to
take
down
a
6
pack
of
these
and
i
would
rather
drink
this
over
macrobrew
average
at
best
but
easy
to
drink
i
can
almost
transport
myself
into
a
deck
chair
with
my
feet
in
a
kiddie
pool
after
mowing
the
lawn
with
this
beer
at
least
i
dont
have
to
mow
the
lawn
d
the
witbier
is
very
easy
to
drink
soft
and
spicy
tart
and
sweet
well
made
im
gonna
save
a
bottle
for
the
summer
and
enjoy
it
in
the
right
season
eric
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
creamy
head
smells
of
yeast
orange
and
maybe
lemon
i
am
a
fan
of
witbiers
i
would
consider
this
as
an
average
one
it
tasted
a
little
too
light
the
carbonation
overwhelmed
most
of
the
tastes
that
go
along
with
this
brew
orange
peel
bread
yeast
and
other
spices
its
low
abv
and
light
taste
made
this
brew
easily
drinkable
got
this
with
the
great
lakes
12
pack
sampler
very
interesting
brew
to
say
the
least
i
found
the
flavor
to
be
a
bit
overbearing
with
the
orange
peel
being
the
dominant
flavor
with
chamomile
coming
in
at
the
end
not
my
preferred
style
of
beer
but
i
can
definitely
respect
the
complexity
of
this
rather
thick
brew
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
uniqe
brew
that
isnt
the
everyday
flavor
a
slow
drinker
of
which
id
only
want
one
in
a
sitting
which
is
why
it
got
such
a
poor
drinkability
rating
from
me
an
interesting
wheat
beer
without
being
the
usual
super
sweet
super
orange
ladened
beer
lots
of
complexities
that
should
keep
certain
fans
happy
a
very
good
wit
my
only
complaint
was
that
it
was
a
touch
thick
it
was
a
lovely
hazy
yellow
smelled
of
sweet
coriander
and
spice
and
tasted
about
the
same
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
the
slice
of
fruit
thing
but
this
beer
seemed
to
be
asking
for
one
go
figure
great
summer
time
happy
hour
dinner
time
well
its
just
a
good
beer
glbc
has
done
it
again
another
simply
good
beer
drinkability
thirst
quenching
i
had
to
take
my
time
with
it
though
drinkable
hell
yeah
and
this
is
by
no
means
my
favorite
style
and
it
is
flavorable
and
weighty
enough
to
make
you
want
to
keep
drinking
it
as
strong
as
any
witbier
you
likely
to
pour
into
your
head
another
great
one
from
glbci
think
i
end
all
my
reviews
of
their
brews
this
way
but
by
zeus
beard
its
true
a
great
witbier
for
a
sunny
day
overall
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
it
compares
favorably
with
the
leinies
sunset
wheat
but
with
a
bit
more
pepper
and
spice
the
pour
into
my
blanch
de
chambly
glass
raises
a
creamy
off
white
head
sticking
around
at
about
one
finger
beneath
the
bubbles
rise
in
furious
plumes
from
a
hazy
gold
body
the
nose
has
strong
coriander
and
yeast
notes
with
a
rich
bready
undertone
the
taste
is
smooth
and
acidic
and
very
citric
its
not
as
wheaty
as
i
would
like
theres
also
a
lot
of
pepper
in
the
aftertaste
its
still
nice
but
ive
had
better
wits
the
mouthfeel
is
quite
light
and
the
carbonation
feels
much
finer
than
it
looks
this
is
a
very
tasty
wit
and
an
easy
drinker

dthis

i
found
thid
brew
to
be
one
dimentional
a
would
have
preferred
something
more
full

and
a
little
more
complexity

are

a
holy
mo
can
do
not
a
style
i
am
crazy
about
but
this
may
be
my
favorite
white
this
isnt
an
overwhelmingly
good
white
ale
but
it
gets
the
job
done
outside
in
midsummer
d
yet
another
exemplary
brew
from
gl
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
highly
recommended
nice
drinkable
witbier
a
very
nice
brew
from
great
lakes
glad
they
switched
it
from
a
seaononal
to
a
permanent
offering
im
also
lucky
to
be
so
close
to
a
great
brewery
now
all
i
need
is
a
swimming
pool
to
sit
by
and
drink
my
holy
moses
santa
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
great
for
the
summer
time
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
pours
from
the
bottle
a
slightly
cloudy
yelloworange
color
theres
a
small
white
carbonated
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
it
smells
like
citrus
bread
and
coriander
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
i
can
taste
lemon
orange
wheat
coriander
and
another
spicy
flavor
with
a
small
bitter
aftertaste
which
lingers
for
a
little
while
after
taking
a
drink
its
easy
drinking
with
a
light
crisp
mouthfeel
another
good
beer
from
great
lakes
this
is
definitely
something
i
would
drink
more
of
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkability
light
body
does
make
it
an
easy
drinker
nice
crisp
brew
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
as
a
session
brew
i
would
definately
drink
this
again
which
is
good
since
i
have
five
left
i
great
example
of
a
wit
i
need
to
spend
more
time
with
great
lakes
brews
this
isnt
exactly
my
kind
of
beer
but
its
the
best
ive
had
in
this
style
i
dont
know
maybe
i
need
to
try
some
more
of
this
style
to
really
appreciate
it
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
but
is
not
as
a
flavorful
as
it
could
be
would
get
something
else
for
the
next
one
12

bottle
best
before

pretty

good

still
enjoyable
cloudy

color
dulled
chamomile
coriander
and
orange
peel
in
the
aroma
with
a
lack
of
honey
which
i
have
grown
to
expect
in
belgian
white
beer
fresh
spicing
and
floral
hop
flavors
with
a
light
hint
of
butter
toffee
and
caramel
a
pretty
nice
white
beer
overall
though
nothing
special
d
all
around
its
ok
the
only
other
wit
bier
ive
had
is
hoegarden
and
blue
moon
two
very
different
belgian
style
wheats
quite
a
superior
witbier
here
tasty
and
full
flavored
this
is
a
beer
that
a
ba
and
you
mother
can
like
equally
well
a
good
full
flavored
brew
defiantly
a
sipper
not
a
quencher
a
lite
colored
yelow
with
a
small
white
forming
after
the
pour
that
disappears
quickly
the
aroma
has
strong
citrus
scents
and
is
accented
by
several
spices
the
taste
of
lite
wheat
and
citrus
dominate
the
flavor
then
the
twang
of
the
spices
ends
on
the
palate
in
the
mouth
it
is
lite
at
the
start
and
gains
some
weight
to
its
consistancy
as
it
is
swallowed
the
spices
tend
to
demenish
aby
hop
flavor
the
wheat
gives
it
that
lite
flavor
that
makes
it
easy
to
sit
down
and
have
several
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
long
one
of
those
rare
refreshing
but
not
simple
brews
its
also
one
of
those
i
cant
believe
i
havent
reviewed
that
yet
beers
a
staple
at
our
home
my
wife
and
i
usually
have
a
few
six
packs
in
the
cellar
and
its
name
has
been
shortened
to
moses
it
is
available
all
year
now
even
at
my
house
stop
on
by
its
that
kind
of
a
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
bone
white
head
beer
is
clear
which
goes
against
the
style
heavy
level
of
carbonation
bubbles
streaming
to
the
top
smell
of
yeast
and
light
malts
slight
citrus
orange
peel
smell
spices
come
through
in
the
taste
but
the
level
of
spicing
is
nicely
done
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
but
certainly
not
excessive
or
bad
very
crisp
mouthfeel
and
finish
to
this
one
a
nice
example
of
this
style
gets
me
in
the
mood
for
those
warm
summer
days
and
a
nice
light
bodied
beer
drinkability
was
good
but
i
dont
think
its
up
to
the
high
standards
of
the
other
great
lakes
i
have
had
i
may
have
to
pick
up
a
sixer
of
this
again
and
see
if
i
need
to
rereview
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rather
light
with
a
plentiful
blast
of
co2
this
would
make
a
great
summer
time
brew
and
i
could
see
a
sixer
going
down
quite
easily
a
nice
wit
and
one
ill
look
for
again
in
the
future
easy
drinking

thanks
davidr
from
toldeo
great
lakes
has
another
winner
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
i
do
wish
i
had
another
one
of
these
so
i
could
experiment
a
little
more
this
is
an
interesting
beer
if
nothing
else
drinkability
was
way
better
than
i
expected
will
drink
it
again
soon
hopefully
mouthfeel
drinkability
this
beer
is
light
to
meduim
bodied
the
taste
is
very
crisp
and
finishes
dry
the
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
i
look
forward
to
more
a
solid
witbier
one
of
the
best
offerings
ive
had
yet
from
glbc
pours
out
to
a
light
gold
color
with
a
haziness
to
it
and
some
notes
of
sediment
lingering
in
the
beer
medium
low
level
of
carbonation
with
some
notes
of
lacing
smell
was
very
nice
yeast
floral
hops
sweet
citrus
taste
was
mildy
complex
yet
remained
on
the
high
end
of
the
flavor
scale
light
hops
and
spices
blended
with
mild
malt
flavor
and
lemon
elements
to
create
an
very
refreshing
experience
mouthfeel
was
light
like
a
liquid
beer
cloud
if
you
will
a
very
good
level
of
drinkability
i
will
be
back
to
this
in
the
summer
months
recommended
drinkability
as
expected
easy
drinking
pours
a
bright
yellow
with
a
bit
of
wit
haziness
and
nice
fine
white
head
smells
nice
and
spicy
orange
with
flowers
in
the
background
a
wonderful
spice
taste
the
label
says
chamomile
and
i
believe
it
theres
just
layers
and
layers
of
different
spices
in
there
and
i
cant
identify
them
all
theyre
playing
the
clove
a
bit
in
this
one
for
effect
and
i
like
it
really
amazing
taste
feels
nice
and
crisp
in
the
mouth
going
down
easily
but
can
get
a
bit
old
after
two
nice
and
easy
to
drink
wit
i
went
back
for
seconds
and
thirds
on
this
one
good
session
beer
but
not
the
best
witbier
could
easily
drink
this
with
some
good
cheeses
or
some
fall
fruits
the
lable
on
the
bottle
and
its
name
drew
me
to
this
beer
first
it
pours
out
a
golden
orange
color
almost
like
a
cloudy
pilsner
its
an
easy
beer
to
drink
although
i
think
i
would
rather
have
one
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
then
a
dreary
november
day
it
has
a
floral
citrice
aroma
and
a
sweet
nose
and
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
good
carbonation
it
reminds
me
of
bells
oberon
a
good
choice
for
some
one
who
might
just
be
getting
into
better
beer
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
throughout
but
is
balanced
by
a
spicy
astringent
note
and
a
bit
of
acidity
tartness
the
orange
character
is
evident
in
the
taste
perhaps
even
dominant
but
it
is
not
quite
as
evident
as
it
is
in
the
finish
the
beer
has
a
full
compliment
of
spicy
notes
though
with
notes
of
spicy
pepper
even
a
bit
of
hot
alcohol
that
is
reminiscent
of
ginger
and
perhaps
even
a
bit
of
chilelike
heat
thankfully
it
is
missing
that
earthy
distracting
note
that
is
characteristic
of
your
typical
american
coriander
which
i
dont
think
belongs
in
beer
except
in
minute
notes
this
beer
has
a
slightly
fuller
mouthfeel
to
it
than
some
wits
but
it
is
still
quite
light
and
refreshing
i
like
the
mouthfeel
of
this
beer
the
level
of
carbonation
in
this
beer
is
moderate
and
it
has
a
full
body
it
is
not
heavy
on
the
palate
but
is
between
light
and
heavy
i
like
this
beer
and
think
that
i
would
definitely
buy
it
again
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
i
could
drink
it
all
night
if
i
were
in
the
mood
for
it
mouthfeel
is
decent
and
the
carbonation
is
not
overbearing
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
and
one
more
solid
offering

great

drinkability
nothing
special
other
than
the

although
i
am
not
one
for
a
belgian
ale
great
lakes
does
a
good
job
here
of
maintaining
the
witbier
tradition
two
main
characteristics
of
this
beer
are
immediately
apparent
first
the
excessive
cloudiness
of
the
ale
leads
one
to
think
that
the
appearance
is
not
the
primary
concern
here
indeed
the
positive
qualities
of
ale
are
the
smell
and
taste
with
a
medium
head
this
ale
gives
off
a
rather
refreshing
sent
of
orange
and
has
a
crisp
citrus
taste
murky

id

but
not

very
refreshing
after
an
afternoon
of
painting
a
house
pours
a
cloudy
hazy
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
yeasty
sweet
and
a
little
spicy
and
herbal
taste
is
a
bit
sweet
at
first
becoming
tart
with
some
herbal
spicyness
tastes
a
lot
like
it
smells
actually
with
a
little
less
sweetness
dry
and
well
carbonated
quite
easy
to
drink
and
pleasant
overall
a
drinkable
brew
if
only
to
quench
your
thirst
at
the
very
least
pours
a
pretty
golden
straw
yellow
with
a
multifinger
head
and
probably
the
best
lacing
ive
seen
smell
is
spicey
with
hints
of
citrus
and
olive
oil
like
a
saison
taste
is
fruity
spicey
and
refreshing
again
with
floral
herbal
and
olive
notes
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
bubbly
and
crisp
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
wit
could
use
some
beefing
up
but
overall
another
solid
brew
from
glbc
kudos
boys
every
sip
dragged
on
with
some
lingering
bitterness
and
the
beer
was
sweeter
than
most
wits
with
a
slightly
larger
mouthfeel
it
is
a
very
cloudy
amberyellow
beer
with
an
slightly
off
white
head
there
is
also
a
visual
appreance
of
yeast
sediment
the
head
also
sticks
around
and
laces
down
the
glass
there
is
a
strong
aroma
of
floral
hops
grass
cleanser
rose
and
peanut
butter
the
taste
is
a
hit
of
strong
floral
hops
which
over
powers
the
malt
it
is
also
slightly
holiday
spicy
the
mouth
feel
and
drinkabilty
of
this
are
sumed
up
in
the
same
phrase
easy
and
smooth
very
refreshing
beer
this
was
a
boring
and
surprisingly
mediocre
beer
from
great
lakes
it
smelled
and
tasted
like
overripe
fruit
and
had
no
standout
qualities
whatsoever
as
a
beer
its
not
too
bad
but
as
a
wit
one
of
the
worst
examples
that
i
have
tasted
im
going
to
stay
away
from
it
and
hope
that
great
lakes
will
stop
making
it
theyre
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
and
it
saddens
me
to
know
that
they
make
a
beer
this
average
one
more
great
one
from
glbc
dthis
beer
has
a
wonderful
smell
that
is
very
different
from
the
taste
it
would
be
nice
if
more
of
the
smell
qualities
were
in
the
taste
aswell
good
wit
but
could
use
some
tuning
for
starters
this
beer
like
most
beers
from
glb
has
a
cool
name
a
beer
is
always
more
interesting
to
me
if
it
has
a
cool
name
and
story
to
go
with
shows
the
brewer
thinks
about
the
details
as
for
the
beer
i
like
it
the
apperance
is
that
of
a
good
belgian
white
i
was
able
to
pour
a
good
head
without
any
trouble
and
i
noticed
that
i
missed
some
of
the
yeast
in
the
bottle
the
smell
is
nice
and
even
but
to
be
honest
my
sense
of
smell
is
still
in
training
so
i
couldnt
pick
out
any
details
the
taste
is
smooth
but
a
little
crisp
probably
from
the
citrus
the
wheat
is
present
but
not
in
the
boldest
of
ways
the
beer
certainly
does
go
down
easy
i
had
no
trouble
finishing
one
and
i
felt
like
i
could
have
another
c
barclay
well
made
well
blended
nice
job
kudos
to
the
brewers
on
this
nice
summer
brew
pours
pale
gold
with
an
orange
tint
and
opaque
after
the
yeast
pour
dense
twofinger
head
with
excellent
retention
and
abundant
spotty
lacing
medicinal
phenolics
in
the
nose
with
a
load
of
coriander
and
citrus
wheat
and
phenol
flavor
upfront
followed
by
a
zesty
blend
of
mild
citrus
herbal
chamomile
and
faint
coriander
the
spices
are
overdone
but
fade
and
the
phenols
hang
on
too
long
in
the
aftertaste
the
carbonation
is
low
and
the
body
is
thin
but
it
gets
some
texture
from
the
wheat
and
yeast
making
it
smooth
if
not
a
little
too
tart
the
phenols
dry
the
finish
and
the
wheatyeast
become
slightly
chalky
effecting
drinkability
but
i
would
still
consider
it
an
above
average
warmweather
beer
poured
hazy
and
strawcolored
with
a
little
head
but
not
much
fine
bubbling
the
aroma
was
mostly
a
wheaty
citrus
smell
almost
a
little
buttery
too
the
taste
was
just
what
i
expected
from
a
witbier
with
just
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
quite
good
i
consumed
the
bottle
without
a
flinch
as
it
went
down
very
nicely
overall
a
satisfying
summer
beer
although
i
think
it
might
be
better
enjoyed
outside
not
in
my
airconditioned
home
a
cloudy
dull
yellow
color
but
with
a
moderate
head
and
good
lacing
smell
is
primarily
of
malt
and
yeast
with
some
citrus
and
floral
notes
taste
is
malty
more
than
anything
theres
some
lemon
and
bubblegum
flavors
but
theyre
in
the
background
mouthfeel
is
full
and
satisfying
im
certainly
not
a
connoisseur
of
witbiersin
fact
ive
tried
very
fewbut
i
get
the
impression
that
the
fruity
and
spiced
flavors
are
supposed
to
take
prominence
over
the
maltiness
still
theres
definitely
some
character
here
and
its
very
easy
to
drink

i

quite
nice
overall
thanks
for
this
sample
cokes
but
moreso
thanx
tenfold
for
the
louie
growler
o
overall
a
fabulous
offering
from
a
fabulous
brewery
one
of
the
better
american
wits
available
definately
worth
a
tryits
one
of
my
favortie
brews
for
the
summer
the
beer
was
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
strong
clung
to
the
glass
i
received
an
excellent
pour
and
the
beer
really
had
some
spectacular
lacing
it
smelled
of
citrus
with
some
maltiness
a
very
good
beer
with
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
a
lemonycitrus
taste
that
dulls
nicely
as
it
passes
over
the
tongue
a
great
summer
beer
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
on
the
deck
as
the
sun
sets
and
the
crickets
start
creaking
and
the
sky
out
towards
that
old
lake
eerie
starts
turning
that
amber
red
of
late
summer
hot
day
beer
but
a
thirst
quencher
not
over
the
head
strong
a
taste
but
thats
okay
here
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
just
right
on
a
hot
daycurrently
hotter
n
hades
here
with
bonus
humidity
to
boot
honey
floral
a
bit
lingering
soft
flavor
pours
out
a
beautifully
light
straw
golden
with
a
bright
white
airy
head
the
head
was
not
as
present
as
i
would
expect
in
this
the
small
head
did
however
leave
some
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
fresh
and
spicy
cloves
hay
and
lemongrass
made
it
a
treat
for
the
nose
the
body
was
clear
with
a
small
amount
of
haziness
a
spicy
and
crisp
taste
hit
the
tongue
with
a
very
clean
finish
a
wonderful
summer
beer
that
could
potentially
be
a
very
nice
crossover
beer
due
to
its
smooth
finish
well
done
very
drinkable
and
jam
packed
with
flavor
highly
recommend
overall
i
had
been
passing
this
beer
up
because
i
didnt
want
to
be
dissapointed
but
im
glad
i
finally
got
it
light
but
not
too
light
and
smooth
even
flavor
make
this
a
great
choice
for
a
hot
day
a
well
balanced
ale
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
dont
want
to
stoop
to
drinking
watereddown
macros
drinkability
this
is
a
good
style
of
beer
from
great
lakes
that
would
make
an
excellent
summer
beer
i
think
moses
cleveland
would
be
proud
that
his
name
is
on
this
beer
every
time
i
crack
one
of
these
open
i
find
myself
staring
at
my
empty
glass
thinking
gone
already
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
again
soon
this
pours
a
nice
pale
yellow
color
with
2
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
moderate
coating
over
the
beer
the
nose
is
rich
with
coriander
and
creamyness
from
the
wheat
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
really
nice
ans
well
with
a
healthy
orangey
dose
of
corainder
and
orangepeel
very
spicey
and
very
refreshing
the
feel
is
moderate
with
a
light
carbonation
this
is
a
find
example
of
the
style
the
only
thing
i
have
against
it
is
the
color
not
quite
white
enough
for
me
taste
benefits
from
a
bit
of
citric
essence
but
dwells
in
the
general
belgian
white
world
heavier
on
the
more
berry
fruit
accents
typical
of
great
lakes
this
beer
is
average
but
a
perfect
exercise
in
the
style
it
was
far
far
superior
on
tap
at
the
brewpub
holy
moses
this
is
pretty
good
not
the
best
for
the
style
in
my
opinion
but
an
overall
good
brew
this
or
the
dortmunder
would
be
my
first
suggestion
for
those
new
to
the
craft
beer
scene
very
nice
orange
cloudy
appearance
a
bit
grassy
tasting
and
the
unfiltering
is
apparent
could
be
a
session
beer
but
no
more
than
any
other
one
of
the
style
ironically
the
tapped
version
is
milder
than
the
bottled
but
i
may
have
enjoyed
it
more
either
example
is
a
great
representative
of
american
witbiers
and
i
highly
recommend
this
one
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
body
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
retains
well
some
sheet
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
aroma
has
a
dominant
yeastiness
with
an
assertive
lemony
citrus
profile
orangepeel
pepper
coriander
and

add
some
spicy
complexity
to
the
nose
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
bodied
with
some
sticky
yeast
and
medium
carbonation
taste
is
lemony
citrus
with
a
pervasive
yeast
presence
clove
and
pepper
add
more
spicy
bitterness
to
the
lemony
citrus
and
yeast
backbone
dry
aftertaste
very
nicely
done
for
an
american
witbier
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried
from
north
america
and
a
very
nice
white
ale
for
summer
quaffing
pale
goldenrod
with
a
tightly
bubbled
white
head
that
rises
up
thickly
and
then
settles
quickly
to
a
fine
bumpy
cap
aroma
of
cinnamon
and
yeast
a
bit
of
citrus
flavor
is
yeasty
upfront
followed
by
some
spice
more
yeast
in
the
finish
and
a
lemony
lingering
taste
a
little
peppery
linger
follows
after
the
lemon
followed
next
by
another
shot
of
the
yeasty
undertone
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
but
crisp
with
a
bubbly
tingly
finish
wellmade
for
the
style
but
not
too
complex
drinkability
on
a
warm
summer
day
these
would
go
down
one
after
the
other
pale
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
fruity
lemon
and
orange
peel
aroma
with
spices
mainly
coriander
fluffy
wheat
flavor
with
fruit
flowery
spicy
flavors
the
coriander
takes
over
in
the
middle
but
the
finish
is
dominated
by
the
citrus
flavors
light
carbonation
although
big
on
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
no
sign
off
the
alcohol
great
drinkability
great
lakes
has
made
a
very
nice
version
of
this
belgian
style
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
with
spot
on
carbonation
the
drinkability
suffers
just
a
bit
from
the
lack
of
balance
while
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
i
guess
i
just
expected
more
form
this
brewery
drinkability
holy
moses
tastes
good
but
i
doubt
i
would
take
down
another
one
of
these
as
a
follow
up
this
style
is
typically
not
one
that
i
desire
a
large
volume
of
another
finely
crafted
great
lakes
beer
strongly
recommended
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
pale
gold
with
a
hige
head
that
hung
out
forever
and
has
great
lace
smells
of
wheat
malt
yeast
orange
and
a
slight
hop
bouquet
wheat
malt
is
present
but
the
first
and
most
present
flavor
is
the
hop
bitterness
the
orange
citrus
flavors
are
present
but
not
as
much
as
the
aroma
would
suggest
very
refreshing
this
is
a
better
than
average
witbier
and
is
very
enjoyable
another
winner
from
great
lakes
pours
very
pale
probably
one
of
the
most
pale
non
macros
i
have
seen
a
very
pale
white
head
is
present
smell
is
of
citrus
peel
and
corriander
tangy
smelling
and
crisp
smelling
if
that
is
possible
taste
is
tart
citrusy
and
of
slight
corriander
very
light
and
refreshing
i
could
quaff
this
stuff
all
day
so
light
and
refreshing
this
stuff
is
awesome

probably
my
new

is

one
of
my
favorites
drinkability
easily
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
maybe
a
bit
lacking
in
overall
character
pours
a
cloudy
banana
yellow
pale
gold
color
with
a
crisp
white
head
aroma
is
fruity
especially
bananas
with
some
spice
and
a
little
yeastiness
to
it
as
well
as
citrous
notes
the
taste
is
big
yet
light
and
creamy
the
dominating
taste
is
yeast
and
wheat
but
it
is
not
overdone
on
the
contrary
the
fruity
taste
is
wonderfully
balanced
by
clove
coriander
and
orange
peel
with
a
slight
dryness
there
is
even
a
hint
of
hops
near
the
finish
helping
this
witbier
to
stand
out
in
a
crowd
mouthfeel
is
light
and
malty

aftertaste
leaves
you
longing
for
another
sip
with

although
not
my
favorite
glbc

definitely
the
best
tasting
and
most
drinkable
witbier
ive
had

12
oz
bottle
with
a

pours
a
hazed
pale
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
sheeting
of
foam
lightly
perfumy
in
the
aroma
my
guess
is
that
it
is
the
chamomile
other
typical
witbier
aromas
of
unmalted
wheat
coriander
and
orange
zest
are
evident
lightly
sweet
spritzy
and
a
good
witbier
the
chamomile
definitely
shows
up
it
the
taste
with
a
light
tealike
feel
very
flowery
hop
bite
is
light
but
present
a
friend
brought
me
back
a
few
beers
after
touring
the
brewery
and
he
told
me
they
serve
it
with
an
orange
wedge
in
the
tasting
room
i
think
its
a
mighty
fine
example
of
a
witbier
without
it
the
addition
of
chamomile
is
certainly
an
interesting
twist
as
well
highly
recommended
12
ounce
bottle
beer
is
good
happy
beering
this
is
everything
an
american
craft
interpretation
of
this
style
should
be
it
is
more
bitter
than
most
belgian
wits
but
true
to
the
original
mission
dry
drinkability
i
am
grateful
they
didnt
design
this
to
be
sweet
and
heavy
like
so
many
other
new
world
renditions
can
be
pours
with
a
twofinger
white
head
that
fades
slowly
leaving
some
lace
cloudy
pale
amber
color
medium
bodied
nose
has
a
very
slight
maltiness
medium
carbonation
layer
of
yeast
at
bottom
of
glass
starts
and
finishes
sweet
hops
stay
mainly
in
the
background

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
liquor
barn
lexington
ky
if
this
had
been
my
first
wit
i
might
have
fallen
in
love
with
the
style
this
would
be
a
great
beer
with
chicken
or
just
sitting
around
with
friends
thanks
jen
i
really
liked
this
one
and
ill
try
to
find
it
again
this
is
one
brew
that
really
offers
a
lot
i
recommend
trying
it
if
you
can
find
it
taste
was
interesting
in
some
ways
but
again
thin
and
with
a
grainy
mouthfeel
very
lacking
when
compared
to
one
of
my
favorites
oberon
from
bells
brewing
in
kalamazoo
mi
i
had
3
bottles
from
the
6
pack
and
gave
the
others
away
usually
i
love
great
lakes
brewing
offerings
edmund
fitzgerald
elliot
ness
but
this
one
left
me
unimpressed
final
thought
doesnt
really
feel
like
a
glbc
byproduct
due
to
the
fact
that
the
taste
isnt
defined
like
their
others
still
a
nice
showing
nonetheless
i
must
admit
i
wasnt
blown
out
of
the
water
after
looking
at
and
smelling
this
beer
from
then
on
though
look
out
holy
moses
is
without
question
my
favorite
witbier
and
is
possibly
my
favorite
summer
seasonal
as
well
great
lakes
brewing
company
continues
to
impress
12oz
bottle
aug

2004
poured
aslightly
hazy
gold
color
with
a
fluffy
head
that
laces
slightly
aroma
is
a
mix
of
yeastiness
and
spices
quite
peppery
body
is
a
bit
thin
flavor
is
thin
also
slightly
watery
some
citrus
but
not
fresh
tasting
overall
this
needs
some
work
holy
moses
parts
the
waters
to
a
good
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
thats
fair
on
its
lace
the
aroma
is
great
for
this
well
balanced
moderatly
carbonated
wit
your
greeted
on
the
nose
by
citric
spice
the
zest
of
lemon
the
taste
carries
that
bold
citric
zest
with
a
touch
of
corriander
and
light
wheat
the
finish
is
slight
bitter
dry
leaving
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
summer
wit
and
another
great
offering
from
a
great
lake
brewer
matches
admirably
against
all
the
best
witbiers
ive
ever
had
good
job
great
lakes
yum
this
is
a
nice
summer
beer
this
is
one
wit
i
search
out
every
summer
tasty
and
very
drinkable
beer
pours
a
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
surfacethin
bubbly
white
head
mouthfeel
is
mediumbodied
and
crisp
aroma
consists
of
coriander
yeast
and
slight
wheat
malt
i
can
almost
detect
the
chamomile
in
the
nose
but
it
would
be
pretty
discreet
if
it
wasnt
mentioned
on
the
label
so
maybe
im
imagining
it
still
it
gives
this
wit
a
unique
aroma
initial
taste
of
wheat
malt
lemony
citrus
and
spice
yeast
and
coriander
make
a
strong
appearance
towards
the
back
finish
is
dry
with
a
some
fruitiness
to
it
this
is
a
decent
witbier
that
serves
as
a
fine
summer
refresher
this
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
great
white
head
the
spicing
is
excellent
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
brighten
up
the
light
wheatiness
making
for
a
very
refreshing
witbier
one
of
the
better
american
takes
on
the
style
i
was
highly
impressed
with
this
one
wow
exceptional
for
the
style
wonderfully
complex
while
retaining
all
the
characteristics
of
a
great
wit
and
maintaining
an
amazing
drinkability
this
is
an
exceptional
beer
brewed
by
an
awesome
brewery
i
dont
want
this
beer
to
end
simply
amazed
taste
this
is
where
i
was
left
dissapointed
it
really
did
not
taste
like
a
wit
beer
but
more
like
a
hefe
weiss
minus
the
yeasty
spiceness
often
accompanied
with
this
brew
my
first
bad
beer
from
great
lakes
not
the
worst
but
it
is
not
there
best
beer
by
far
dn
unreal
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
beer
by
a
brewery
that
for
me
at
least
can
do
no
wrong
it
remains
a
decent
version
and
i
sure
wouldnt
turn
one
or
6
down
on
a
sultry
day
no
sir
drinkability
i
just
wasnt
excited
about
this
beer
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
certainly
more
interesting
examples
of
the
style
out
there
a
great
summer
ale
crisp
refreshing
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
rich
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
super
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
a
warm
summers
day
out
on
the
porch
a
belgian
that
could
be
a
good
session
beer
what
a
concept
drinkability
is
decent
think
this
beer
is
meant
for
draught
i
believe
it
really
loses
its
aromatic
delight
in
the
bottle
finish
is
all
i
am
not
really
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
i
really
couldnt
ask
for
much
better
after
mowing
the
lawn
pours
a
light
yellow
color
mildly
opaque
with
a
rather
compact
white
head
aroma
of
citrus
spice
and
vanilla
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
nicely
spiced
and
lightly
hopped
flavor
the
finish
is
vigorously
crisp
citrus
and
lends
to
enjoying
this
wit
longer
than
i
do
most
others
of
the
style
well
with
so
many
great
lakes
beers
i
hope
to
review
im
running
out
of
shots
at
cleveland
but
ill
just
end
by
saying
this
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
and
one
that
id
have
more
of
whereever
i
could
find
it
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
bright
almost
neon
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
and
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
was
full
of
citrus
with
hints
of
yeast
the
taste
was
very
strong
and
quite
spicy
the
wheat
portion
came
through
strongly
but
it
was
overpowered
by
the
spiciness
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
much
and
had
a
little
trouble
finishing
it
brewed
in
a
belgian
wit
style
but
didnt
quite
get
there
aroma
was
yeasty
and
faintly
floral
initial
flavor
was
somewhat
tart
and
weissbierlike
belgian
wit
spicing
was
too
reserved
there
was
a
faint
floralherbal
character
but
it
was
just
too
far
in
the
background
certainly
not
every
take
on
the
style
has
to
hit
you
in
the
face
with
spices
i
e
blue
moon
but
they
should
make
more
of
a
statement
than
in
this
beer
to
add
some
depth
i
dont
know
what
happened
here
so
far
this
is
the
only
great
lakes
brew
that
i
tried
and
didnt
love
im
sorry
but
it
just
wasnt
good
at
all
citric
acid
taste
sour
lemony
flavors
there
are
tons
a
flowery
notes
to
go
along
with
it
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
and
could
barely
finish
it
first
time
in
the
bottle
this
is
just
as
good
as
on
tap
the
appearance
is
just
as
robust
and
the
nose
stays
as
aromatic
as
from
the
tap
this
beer
is
fairly
loaded
with
spice
and
fruit
notes
and
the
smell
keeps
the
flowery
sense
that
adds
a
touch
of
mystique
to
this
nice
glbc
offering
holy
moses
another
fine
brew
from
cleveland
very
hazy
with
a
nice
golden
color
not
much
head
though
although
it
left
a
nice
cover
over
the
beer
aroma
is
somewhat
unusual
for
the
style
fairly
floral
light
in
body
somewhat
carbonated
but
the
taste
is
a
little
hard
to
pin
down
more
sour
than
is
typical
than
with
most
wheat
beers
this
is
much
more
belgian
than
german
in
style
and
is
missing
the
banana
yeast
notes
one
would
expect
even
after
i
swirled
up
the
yeast
on
the
bottom
very
nice
citrus
notes
with
the
orange
family
dominating
although
the
sourness
is
present
throughout
crisp
finish
easy
to
drink
nice
for
the
summer
and
refreshing
although
ill
take
a
german
for
my
next
one
wow
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beer
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
white
head
that
hangs
around
for
awhile
nice
lace
smells
like
a
wheat
not
as
strong
smelling
as
some
no
over
powering
smells
smells
clean
taste
great
i
pick
up
a
hint
of
lemon
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
the
second
one
is
even
better
than
the
first
my
bud
light
friend
even
thought
it
went
down
nice
a
very
enjoyable
summer
beer
its
crisp
refreshing
and
leaves
me
wanting
more
thankfully
i
have
more
i
had
this
brew
in
a
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
that
is
a
bit
hazy
there
are
2
fingers
of
head
with
good
retention
there
is
a
bit
of
lacing
left
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
yeast
and
fruit
very
sweet
smelling
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
sour
lemon
not
too
tart
though
with
a
light
yeasty
flavor
it
is
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
nice
and
heavy
the
drinkability
is
also
very
good
for
this
awesome
wit
this
beer
poured
out
a
very
pale
and
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
the
head
was
small
white
and
creamy
sour
yeasty
tones
in
the
aroma
and
in
the
taste
very
light
tasting
not
overwhelming
at
all
some
spiciness
with
a
nice
wheat
sourness
not
much
hop
bitterness
or
presence
nice
and
tasty
light
and
drinkable
a
good
wit
this
is
to
date
the
most
surprising
belgian
styled
ale
ive
had
a
wonderful
mix
of
spices
to
create
a
unique
beer
within
the
class
what
a
good
day
when
you
go
down
the
liquor
store
a
day
like
today
in
our
countrys
drinking
culture
known
for
piss
beer
and
lime
wedged
filled
clear
bottles
there
is
nothing
more
refreshing
than
walking
by
everyone
else
with
a
six
pack
of
great
lakes
holy
moses
at
the
beginning
of
the
pour
a
crystal
clear
gold
but
this
is
followed
by
the
swirl
of
the
bottle
to
get
all
of
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
in
order
to
place
the
haze
and
transform
the
appearance
into
a
beautiful
sunrise
on
a
slightly
hazy
morning
the
massive
foaming
head
glistens
as
i
attempt
my
first
sniff
at
the
aroma
wonderful
hints
of
clove
and
the
yeasty
citrusy
zest
with
coriander
and
other
spices
going
on
when
i
sipped
on
this
fine
summer
day
treat
i
was
welcomed
with
much
of
the
same
flavors
and
the
bite
of
the
wheat
malt
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
like
smoothness
wow
this
beer
ties
it
all
together
so
nicely
the
musty
yeast
producing
such
great
tones
along
with
all
of
the
spices
added
this
beer
deserves
so
much
credit
in
the
world
of
wits
mouthfeel
light
and
fluffy
but
syrupy
in
the
finish
just
sticks
to
my
taste
buds
i
love
it
wow
drinkability
well
ill
have
another
what
a
great
treat
for
anyday
just
a
well
constructed
beers
and
if
your
arent
into
wheats
try
this
one
out
it
may
just
sway
how
you
feel
about
them
served
with
a
thick
white
head
that
rises
above
the
top
of
the
glass
like
a
giant
cloud
atop
a
misty
yellow
mountain
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
bananna
and
clove
notes
but
there
is
also
a
nice
yeast
component
that
lends
a
fresh
bread
note
like
manna
from
heaven
the
taste
is
light
and
fruity
coriander
spice
with
a
creamy
bready
note
as
well
light
apple
and
bananna
fruits
on
the
tongue
decent
bitterness
on
the
finish
lingers
a
bit
on
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
robust
and
creamy
which
when
matched
to
the
fine
carbonation
leads
to
excellent
drinakbility
and
a
tremendous
sense
of
refreshment
after
searching
for
nearly
two
years
for
this
beer
i
can
say
it
is
nearly
a
religious
experience
another
world
class
beer
from
glbc
well
this
beer
is
finally
back
in
a
bottle
for
non
ohioians
and
less
traveled
ohioians
it
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
color
and
formed
a
huge
foamy
white
head
no
doubt
due
to
the
heavy
carbonation
present
the
lace
latticed
the
glass
as
the
white
clouds
vanished
and
evaporated
i
tickled
my
senses
with
an
aroma
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
delicate
hint
of
spices
but
not
banging
you
over
the
head
like
some
other
wits
do
coriander
was
noticible
but
my
recovering
sinuses
dealing
with
the
crazy
ohio
spring
failed
to
descern
the
other
ones
present
the
flavor
was
of
hops
and
spices
with
a
finish
that
had
a
tangy
feel
to
reflecting
the
spices
and
carbonation
another
fine
great
lakes
beer
had
on
tap
at
ds
luminous
golden
color
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
zesty
malty
and
delicate
spicy
aromas
fill
the
nose
taste
is
much
the
same
but
malts
and
lemonylike
zesty
dominate
any
spicy
elements
smooth
and
medium
bodied
drinkability
was
there
interesting
and
not
onesided
like
other
wits
can
be
this
is
yet
another
quality
offering
from
glbc
this
is
one
excellent
beer
pours
a
goldish
yellow
hue
with
a
white
head
smells
of
wheat
malt
coriander
and
yeasty
spices
this
stuff
tastes
just
as
good
as
it
smells
refreshing
spiciness
mixed
with
wheaty
maltiness
id
recommend
this
to
anybody
who
has
a
chance
to
try
it
drinkability
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
quite
surprising
given
my
loyalty
to
the
hops
i
only
with
that
this
was
available
in
bottles
to
take
back
to
va
with
me
overall
a
very
good
belgian
wit
my
all
time
favorite
hefe
dont
judge
it
is
perfection
overall
a
nice
straightforward
light
wheat
beer
while
there
are
better
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
good
and
enjoyed
it
i
would
gladly
drink
this
again
hazy
look
smells
of
spices
with
a
little
bit
of

smooth
and
refreshing
taste
i
really
like
this
belgian
beer
especially
on
draft
lightpale
color
almost
fruity
in
smell
but
had
a
heavy
malt
flavor
in
taste
o
a
pretty
good
example
of
a
witbier
as
far
as
the
aroma
and
taste
goes
but
a
weak
body
and
oddly
high
carbonation
for
the
style
really
damage
this
beer
definitely
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
witbier
very
carbonated
compared
to
most
belgians
something
i
didnt
like
smells
and
feels
great
but
better
tasting
belgians
out
there
this
was
a
great
example
of
a
nearperfect
witbier
love
this
beer
hazy
look
to
it
drinks
very
nice
d
exceptional
this
beer
is
a
very
good
widely
available
belgian

definitely
worth
ones

this
one
a
shot
you
will
not
be
disappointed
overall
an
average
white
beer
that
is
too
bland
and
missing
a
little
freshness
such
a
good
beer
overall
smell
is
strange
at
first
barn
like
no
hops
in
smell
mostly
citrus
and
coriander
the
taste
is
mostly
wheaty
with
subtle
citrus
and
banana
notes
very
crisp
my
goto
beer
i
prefer
to
pour
it
in
a
chalice
the
color
is
always
bright
yellow
with
a
perfect
white
head
of
foam
by
far
the
best
mass
market
wheat
beer
in
existence
the
true
nectar
of
the
gods
the
best
part
about
it
is
that
it
doesnt
taste
like
wheat
at
all
hoegaarden
tastes
like
sweet
citrus
with
refreshing
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
finish
if
i
were
stranded
on
a
deserted
island
and
i
could
only
take
one
lifetime
supply
of
beer
this
would
be
it
fell
in
love
with
this
beer
visiting
my
brother
in
belgium
back
in
1998
when
it
finally
became
available
in
the
states
i
was
overjoyed
the
americanized
version
was
not
quite
as
good
but
still
outstanding
as
i
come
from
a
family
of
wine
snobs
this
is
my
go
to
dinner
beer
though
it
is
great
anytime
i
dont
really
like
belgian
whites
so
thats
really
my
only
beef
here
other
than
a
horrible
after
taste
great
tasting
and
crisp
a
staple
in
my
fridge
one
of
my
favs
a
nonbitter
without
being
too
fruity
did
i
mention
that
last
week
i
drank
shock
top
typical
belgian
very
nice
mouthful
creamy
fine
carbonation
very
nice
when
the
mood
strikes
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
super
silky
smooth
wit
a
little
more
watery
than
i
remember
it
but
still
substantial
in
flavors
aromas
so
tasty
so
entirely
refreshing
i
like
the
cloudy
appearance
but
its
a
little
bit
like
the
bulgarian
wheat
drink
called
boza
a
lovely
beer
as
far
as
im
concerned
and
one
of
those
that
opened
my
eyes
to
the
possibilities
of
a
wheat
beer
excellent
stuff
all
around
i
am
finding
i
dont
like
plain
wheat
jus
flavored
not
a
real
fan
of
coriander
or
cilantro
in
my
food
same
for
beer
this
has
a
good
look
and
mouth
feel
but
i
couldnt
drink
it
i
trust
the
brothers
ratings
and
for
most
everyone
this
is
probably
a
good
beer
sorry
to
say
this
very
refined
beer
with
pronounced
spices
aroma
excellent
in
all
occasions
the
taste
is
so
much
better
than
its
cloudy
appearance
top
of
its
class
so
glad
it
is
year
round
the
classic
belgium
white
wheat
beer
tastes
very
sour
kind
of
like
saint
monon
but
lower
quality
crisp
flavorful
and
refreshing
highly
drinkable
and
perfect
when
thirsty
one
of
my
favorite
white
ales
cloudy
look
with
a
great
taste
my
only
issue
is
that
there
is
barely
any
head
on
the
beer
which
makes
it
look
a
little
flat
when
poured
tried
the
original
whereas
there
is
a
locally
made
version
which
is
a
very
good
reproduction
but
for
same
price
as
was
when
imported
i
dont
think
so
when
in
korea
you
drink
this
because
either
there
is
no
better
option
or
you
just
dont
know
the
taste
of
the
real
deal
good
color
and
an
easy
pour
with
not
a
lot
of
foam
overall
good
taste
but
it
needs
to
be
really
cold
for
me
to
enjoy
very
powerful
estery
smell
that
overpowers
the
rest
of
the
beer

the

ive
tasted

when
choices
are

overall
i
felt
compelled
to
try
this
after
a
reviewer
on
this
site
claimed
that
once
youve
had
one
you
never
go
back
well
that
might
be
overstating
the
case
but
this
beer
is
not
bad
i
really
like
franziskaner
and
therefore
i
think
i
admire
the
yeastiness
of
this
one
too
i
am
not
sorry
i
bought
it
ill
probably
get
it
again
a
good
addition
to
the

good

nothing

022413
on

this
is
a
solid

brew
that
i
use
to
build
on
a
la
the
dirty
hoe
w
a
splash
of
framboise
or
as
a
session
filler
if
im
drinking
too
much
too
fast
ill
call
for
a
hoe
dirty
or
otherwise
an
ok
beer
that
i
would
have
again
if
nothing
better
available
it
made
a
good
thirst
quencher
in
singapore
back
in
the
days
when
it
was
this
or
tiger
beer
tasty
and
has
some
character
but
still
not
near
as
exciting
as
blanche
de
namur
or
blanche
de
bruxelles
which
remain
on
top
of
the
style
in
my
opinion
o
a
nice
wit
i
like
the
use
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
which
is
perfectly
blended
into
the
rest
of
the
beer
for
me
the
banana
and
bubblegum
are
just
slightly
too
pronounced
nevertheless
an
awesome
beer
by
far
the
best
belgian
white
ive
had
not
only
could
you
distinctly
smell
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
but
it
mixed
well
with
the
wheat
and
barely
unlike
any
other
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
and
it
had
a
great
citrusy
taste
that
i
found
very
appealing
i
believe
the
brewer
kept
it
simple
with
their
blend
of
yeast
its
a
soft
hazy
and
mild
belgian
wheat
beer
a
little
too
much
spices
for
me
but
better
than
ob
or
cass
when
in
korea
i
know
this
is
not
from
korea
but
a
lot
of
bars
have
hoegaarden
for
some
reason
yummy
citrus
herb
and
refreshing
cheers
prot
and
happy
oktoberfest
to
all
to
date
the
best
beer
i
have
had
im
a
white
beer
fan
and
hoegaarden
has
its
own
flavour
which
is
stronger
than
for
example
tucher
or
such
a
must
try
beer
refreshing
beer
very
light
with
a
slight
citrus
taste
would
drink
it
again
hoegaarden
does
some
good
belgian
beers
for
a
largescale
brewery
and
this
is
the
most
common
one
youll
find
in
bars
and
restaurants
its
a
witbier
and
its
pretty
middle
of
the
road
for
its
kind
though
certainly
many
have
tried
to
copy
it
over
the
years
because
of
its
success
i
think
some
of
the
local
craft
brews
in
the
us
have
improved
upon
the
original
though
it
was
just
to
know
something
so
celebrated
i
liked
the
taste
of
cloves
that
was
in
his
mouth
but
i
prefer
other
appreciated
with
tilapia
fillets
the
vanilla
and
clove
qualities
make
it
taste
a
bit
like
a
crisp
dry
hefeweizen
the
spicy
peppery
qualities
are
thankfully
mild
making
this
one
pretty
balanced
and
refreshing
beer
typical
of
belgium
weizen
bier
slight
fruity
banana

easy

one
of
my
favorites
probably
one
of
the
worst
if
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
leaves
a
horrible
taste
in
your
mouth
when
you
finish
one
of
my
favorite
beers
great
flavor
of
orange
peel
and
coriander
a
little
pricey
but
worth
the
buy
give
it
a
try
if
u
haven
t
tried
it
u
won
t
be

where
i
can
actually
drink
it
faint
scents
of
coriander
and
clove
fill
my
nose
with
similar
flavors
on
my
tongue
accompanied
by
just
the
barest
hint
of
banana
bread
a
little
bit
of
orange
peel
makes
itself
known
on
the
back
of
my
tongue
creamy
medium
bodied
not
bad
for
the
style
but
theres
much
better
out
there
its
easy
to
look
for
ways
to
mark
this
beer
down
because
you
kind
of
want
to
because
its
so
well
known
and
common
but
being
totally
fair
and
honest
it
is
an
excellent
wheat
beer
the
head
is
fluffy
white
the
colour
is
exactly
what
you
would
like
to
see
in
a
wheat
beer
cloudy
and
golden
with
streams
of
bubbles
and
the
smell
and
taste
is
smooth
inviting
and
rewarding
i
imagine
i
could
sit
and
drink
this
one
after
another
until
i
fell
over
and
enjoy
every
minute
of
it
its
a
really
delicious
and
enjoyable
beer
thats
accessible
for
almost
everyone
its
both
an
easy
entry
beer
and
a
beer
youll
want
to
return
to
good
choice
for
summer
wheat
it
always
tastes
different
every
time
i
try
it
but
honestly
its
solid
sweetest

whats
present
here
is
nice

theres
not
enough
of
it
needs
more
potency
or
more
complexity
but
its
rather
refreshing
as
is
overall
i
like
this
beer
overall
i
am
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
and
this
hits
the
spot
sweet
with
some
lemon
its
light
fizzy
fluffy
creamy
and
i
love
it
the
first
time
i
ever
had
this
beer
i
fell
in
love
with
it
and
ever
since
then
i
compare
most
wheat
beers
i
try
to
it
it
pours
light
and
cloudy
with
a
soft
gold
color
and
has
a
very
thick
foamy
head
tastes
very
smooth
and
thin
yet
it
has
a
rich
citrus
and
vanilla
finish
which
rounds
the
beer
off
wonderfully
id
recommend
this
one
to
anyone
who
wants
to
try
belgium
beers
the
rest
a
solid
white
ale
a
good
definition
of
the
style
for
the
style
its
a
worthy
contender
easy
to
drink
and
enough
flavor
to
please
this
is
a
solid
summer
beer
overall
a
decent
beer
especially
in
the
summer
overall
a
really
good
beer
i
really
like

beers
and
i
know
this
is
the

with

a

that
is
a

initial
foray
into

for

to

scene
since
it
is
very
consistent
and
accessible
a
delicious

that
holds
its

even
now
as
the

grows

a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
is
ok
nothing
bad
you
can
smell
the
citrus
in
this
beer
the
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
with
some
citrus
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
i
would
get
this
brew
again
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
75
out
5
pours
cloudy
and
the
color
of
light
straw
when
held
to
the
light
in
the
room
its
a
lemony
yellow
head
is
fat
white
and
lasts
nose
was
mild
lemon
a
bit
of
pepper
and
some
wheat
like
a
light
cracker
taste
follows
the
nose
all
the
way
lemon
on
light
cracker
with
a
bit
of
tartness
on
the
back
end
watery
and
thin
body
it
finishes
very
dry
and
leaves
a
light
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
refreshing
and
very
mild
im
not
one
who
usually
goes
for
lighter
beers
but
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
a
simple
style
that
was
elegantly
executed
it
pours
a
light
but
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
is
full
of
citrus
and
belgian
wheat
the
taste
is
light
with
a
bunch
of
citrus
flavors
like
lemon
orange
peel
and
a
hint
of
banana
that
add
to
the
wheat
flavor
and
give
it
a
nice
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
the
only
problem
for
me
as
it
was
a
little
too
light
for
the
winter
but
i
can
see
this
being
a
staple
of
the
summer
very
much
enjoyed
and
would
definitely
recommend
to
any
blue
moon
fans
looking
to
step
it
up
o
nothing
really
blows
me
away
but
an
example
that
is
true
to
the
style
o
a
great
tasting
wheat
beer
that
i
will
revisit
pours
a
hazy
golden
lemon
in
color
with
a
about
a
3finger
white
foamy
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
before
settling
down
to
about
45mm
some
sediment
is
seen
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
after
the
pour
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
grains
lemon
with
orange
peel
and
spice
the
taste
is
about
the
same
with
the
mix
of
orange
and
lemon
zest
coming
through
first
with
some
spice
for
the
finish
semisweet
also
mediumbodied
with
perfect
carbonation
actually
not
a
bad
white
ale
that
doesnt
have
a
harsh
or
bitter
aftertaste
unlike
some
by
far
my
favorite
beer
i
keep
it
on
tap
at
home
and
enjoy
it
year
round
a
perfect
summer
wit
bier
that
still
refreshes
in
the
cold
winter
months
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
visiting
the
brewery
in
hoegaarden
belgium
twice
if
only
i
could
get
the
american
bartenders
to
pronounce
the
name
correctly
they
insisit
on
hoe
instead
of
hoo
nevertheless
this
belgian
wheat
has
set
the
standard
for
all
the
american
ripoffs
like
blue
moon
great
yeast
esters
with
more
malt
body
than
i
recall
not
my
favorite
style
and
the
skunky
notes
are
slightly
offputting
finished
a
little
weak
but
a
good
classic
beer
o
not
a
big
witbier
fan
but
the
flavor
profile
is
pretty
nice
just
wish
it
wasnt
so
toned
down
seems
like
its
made
to
appeal
to
a
wide
variety
of
people
that
arent
all
craft
beer
drinkers
still
not
bad
and
quite
refreshing
oddly
enough
hoegaarden
has
somewhat
convinced
me
to
move
from
ipa
and
start
drinking
wheatier
beers
bottle
is
appealing
has
a
tart
and
spicy
taste
is
quite
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
drink
it
every
day
it
stands
alone
or
is
good
with
food
and
has
the
benefit
of
being
easy
to
find
in
grocery
stores
even
trader
joes
has
it
and
it
is
cheap
well
worth
it
a
fine
beer
and
actually
stood
up
very
well
blind
against
allagash
white
overall
i
could
drink
this
one
by
the
gallon
good
assertive
taste
from
the
wheat
and
yeast
without
being
overly
spiced
like
some
wits
my
favorite
wit
that
ive
had
so
far
would
make
an
excellent
summer
beer
i
would
rank
hoegaarden
below
most
hefeweizens
but
above
most
american
pale
wheats
exceedingly
refreshing
and
a
good
change
of
pace
from
the
boozy
dipas
and
stouts
common
this
time
of
year
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
very
crisp
and
high
in
carbonation
almost
has
a
bite
to
it
enjoyable
ogreat
beer
that
smells
like
it
taste
good
beer
i
like
and
will
have
more
has
a
nice
head
and
some
lace
would
be
good
at
a
bbq
or
a
high
end
eatery
i
think
a
lot
of
ladies
would
like
it
it
is
not
so
strong
aromatically
served
in
a
pint
glass
slightly
warm
but
good
this
is
my
time
with
this
beer
and
i
will
share
with
my
friends
my
thoughts
the
cloveybannana
tones
linger
through
the
finish
but
do
not
over
power
i
could
drink
it
all
day
this
is
my
first
time
drinking
hoegaarden
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
kind
of
tastes
like
alcoholic
birch
beer
to
me
which
i
find
pretty
interesting
definitely
in
my
top
5
favorite
beers
right
now
and
worth
the
money
big
ups
to
europe
for
their
fine
beer
production
had
on
tap
for
the
purpose
of
this
review
this
was
a
grad
school
staple
however
and
i
am
quite
familiar
with
this
classic
witbier
in
the
bottle
as
well
a
hazy
banana
yellow
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
white
head
and
ample
carbonation
hoegaarden
smells
of
fruity
yeast
esters
first
and
foremost
along
with
some
dry
bread
and
phenolic
spice
notes
like
allspice
or
dilute
clove
i
remember
this
beer
being
hugely
fruity
and
fairly
sour
as
well
less
spicy
and
my
memory
was
indeed
pretty
accurate
a
little
dry
popcorn
malt
and
lots
of
bubble
gumtutti
fruity
esters
along
with
some
banana
the
spicy
phenols
take
a
back
seat
but
there
is
a
sour
backdrop
that
evokes
a
little
raw
pineapple
or
maybe
unripe
apples
or
pears
that
prevents
the
sweetness
from
being
cloying
the
coriander
spice
shows
up
in
the
finish
along
with
a
pleasant
lemony
sourness
but
is
fairly
downplayed
to
the
betterment
of
the
beer
itself
drink
this
and
then
try
a
rickards
white
or
another
mainstream
us
or
canadian
wit
and
youll
see
what
i
mean
the
europeans
use
this
spice
more
strategically
and
do
not
carpet
bomb
the
taste
buds
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
and
there
is
some
residual
sweetness
but
the
body
is
still
fairly
thin
and
watery
i
guess
its
a
witbier
after
all
if
there
is
a
standout
flaw
said
flaw
is
too
much
carbonation
that
masks
the
fruit
and
spice
flavors
more
than
is
necessary
still
any
wit
fan
should
know
this
icon
o
a
solid
widely
available
wit
and
a
personal
favorite
this
is
the
classic
wheat
beer
taste
if
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
look
right
here
uniquely
spicy
but
not
for
everyone
or
every
occasion
i
enjoy
it
mostly
by
itself
although
it
goes
very
well
with
meals
especially
heavy
ones
i
love
the
smoooth
texture
light
quality
cardamom
and
orange
spice
and
fullyetmanageable
head
right
now
other
beers
simply
are
bland
to
me
o
what
happened
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
this
beer
has
declined
im
not
sure
which
certainly
it
has
that
corianderheavy
quality
that
i
recall
not
a
terrible
beer
by
any
means
just
not
what
i
remember
as
the
standard
for
wit
bier
hoegaarden
pours
as
one
would
imagine
with
a
cloudy
golden
hue
and
a
big
head
that
lingers
around
just
long
enough
coriander
is
persistent
throughout
the
nose
and
flavor
this
is
backed
up
by
zesty
orange
lemon
and
some
spicier
pepper
notes
a
light
body
and
aggressive
carbonation
is
is
balance
with
a
slight
creaminess
in
the
mouth
feel
that
lends
itself
to
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
beer
overall
its
hard
to
complain
about
this
since
it
is
often
considered
to
be
the
standard
witiber
although
its
certainly
not
the
best
its
a
refreshing
beer
with
good
flavor
but
its
also
not
that
interesting
either
without
a
doubt
the
best
witiber
thats
widely
available
i
can
find
it
at
any
grocery
store
and
many
gas
stations
but
its
not
complex
enough
to
be
intriguing
o
refreshing
with
decent
flavors
but
too
heavy
on
the
coriander
in
my
opinion
wheat
beers
are
like
grilled
cheese
sandwhiches
since
they
are
all
pretty
decent
its
very
hard
to
find
one
that
stands
out
this
one
does
in
its
unique
floral
taste
hoegaarden
is
tasty
and
refreshing
the
flavor
is
floral
with
some
citrus
and
spice
quite
light
and
smooth
bit
creamy
overall
world
class
this
is
the
wit
that
all
others
try
to
emulate
the
finish
and
the
citrus
are
just
out
standing
it
is
so
crisp
and
refreashing
and
a
great
summer
beer
o
i
think
this
is
very
goodbalanced
wit
serving
type
ontap
smells
of
spice
coriander
a
soft
citrusy
taste
almost
sweet
like
a
carbonated
soft
drink
very
pleasing
on
the
pallette
this
is
the
beer
i
would
sip
at
a
cafe
on
a
warm
pleasant
summers
day
my
first
belgian
beer
brings
back
lots
of
good
memories
always
a
favorite
poured
slowly
into
a
cold
frosty
glass
naturally
cloudy
golden
appearance
with
a
thick
foamy
head
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
extremely
smooth
taste
hints
of
citrus
and
orange
peel
very
full
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
my
personal
favourite
witbier
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
especially
for
a
first
witbier
so
this
is
a
basic
wit
beer
that
is
a
summer
classic
i
really
dont
need
to
review
much
here
maybe
over
spiced
which
cheapens
the
taste
but
overall
you
throw
a
lemon
wedge
in
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
quite
enjoyable
the
rating
is
really
based
on
what
it
is
and
thats
a
tasty
beer
to
have
in
quantity
during
the
summer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
straw
yellow
with
onefinger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
to
a
froth
cap
decent
lacing
typical
witbier
aroma
orange
zest
and
coriander
taste
is
spicy
with
a
faint
malt
sweetness
goes
down
dry
and
finishes
slightly
bitter
light
bodied
with
effervescent
carbonation
make
this
one
great
summer
session
beer
i
wont
drink
much
of
it
because
white
ales
are
just
not
my
thing
but
damn
is
it
a
good
example
of
one
rickards
be
damned
o
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
liked
and
i
still
like
it
alot
to
this
day
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
provide
a
more
unique
flavour
than
most
beers
and
it
stands
out
from
the
crowd
as
different
the
lack
of
carbonation
actually
works
in
its
favour
and
this
beer
is
best
enjoyed
from
the
official
glass
which
adds
to
the
experience
if
you
are
already
a
fan
the
belgian
monks
that
created
this
knew
what
they
were
doing
overall
i
love
this
beer
is
really
refreshing
in
tropical
weather
like
costa
rica
i
must
say
i
am
a
tried
and
true
hophead
loving
hopnoxious
bitterness
ive
even
stated
that
i
dont
like
wheat
beers
stillthis
is
good
stuff
and
i
recommend
it
for
sure
paid
9
06
for
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
was
kinda
let
down
a
little
bit
ive
heard
nothing
but
good
about
this
beer
and
im
not
the
one
to
be
a
rain
cloud
over
someones
parade
but
man
this
beer
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
taste
just
like
juicy
fruit
bumble
gum
to
me
haha
its
not
a
bad
beer
ive
just
had
better
in
its
class
poured
23
into
a
frosted
pint
glass
swirled
remainder
in
bottle
and
poured
the
rest
definitely
a
sexy
and
refreshing
looking
beer
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
nice
foamy
white
head
lots
of
noticeable
carbonation
and
unfiltered
sediment
sweet
aroma
of
orange
and
coriander
the
taste
meets
the
nose
with
the
orange
and
coriander
very
smooth
and
light
a
touch
sweet
but
good
refreshing
great
summer
beer
no
matter
how
you
slice
it
id
have
again
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
good
beer
hoegaarden
is
a
classic
wit
that
manages
to
hold
up
well
in
this
era
of
microbrews
tasty
and
sessionable
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
hw
is
better
balanced
with
no
alcohol
feel
in
the
mouth
although
lacking
balanced
flavor
lt
does
not
taste
overly
alcoholic
but
there
is
more
alcohol
feel
in
it
both
are
light
and
under
the
right
circumstances
refreshing
with
right
foods
e
g
thai
and
indonesian
curries
and
indian
food
that
is
not
overly
saucy
lt
can
be
a
very
serviceable
beer
but
the
strong
coriander
flavor
and
odor
make
it
unsuitable
for
most
occasions
including
everyday
drinking
hw
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
everyday
pour
especially
in
the
summer
original
or
not
it
likely
would
not
survive
a
comparison
to
some
of
the
better
american
varieties
such
as
allagash
but
it
can
certainly
hold
its
own
long
trail
on
the
other
hand
has
a
long
learning
curve
ahead
of
it
as
a
brewery
even
their
best
products
pale
ale
and
ipa
seem
to
offer
only
a
single
taste
note
where
competitors
offer
a
bouquet
of
flavors
and
aromas
hoegaarden
does
pretty
much
only
one
thing
but
it
does
it
rather
well
overall
i
was
a
little
disappointed
it
was
a
good
beer
but
something
that
i
would
grow
tired
of
after
two
pints
o
enjoyable
around
the
pool
o
when
i
drink
this
beer
i
remember
my
first
beer
that
was
had
in
germany
at
a
biergarten
very
memorable
and
in
league
with
the
summer
season
currently
upon
us
cheers
o
a
great
beer
quite
comparable
to
many
other
wheat
beers
i
keep
getting
a
thick
creamy
feeling
from
this
brew
which
turns
out
to
be
quite
pleasant
will
pour
a
five
white
head
just
as
expected
for
a
wheat
pale
straw
and
cloudy
good
head
faint
yeast
and
distinct
wheat
flavor
but
what
else
would
you
expect
this
brewery
has
it
down
after
568
years
330ml
bottle
from
gift
specialists
oceanside
california
all
in
all
one
nice
belgian
wit
maybe
not
as
striking
like
some
german
top
hefeweissen
but
has
enough
complexity
to
charm
with
every
tasting
overall
quite
an
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
wheat
and
sweet
citrus
brew
ocompared
against
great
wit
beers
the
granddaddy
that
is
hoegaarden
falls
a
little
short
in
the
complexity
and
strength
departments
the
looks
are
pretty
weak
too
nevertheless
this
beer
is
quaffable
and
a
good
fit
for
a
hot
summers
day
cloudy
pale
gold
with
a
huge
white
head
comprised
of
tiny
bubbles
that
takes
a
while
to
settle
and
laces
nicely
the
smell
is
clean
wheat
maltiness
with
lemon
and
orange
citrus
combined
with
some
peppery
spice
pretty
much
spot
on
for
a
wit
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
the
spices
come
out
in
the
front
with
the
citrus
moving
to
the
background
a
background
well
framed
in
by
the
wheat
also
perceivable
is
some
yeast
character
but
overall
everything
is
a
bit
overshadowed
by
the
coriander
spiciness
the
mouthfeel
is
acceptable
with
high
levels
of
carbonation
combined
with
a
light
body
however
i
would
have
preferred
it
to
be
a
bit
crisper
with
a
cleaner
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
commendable
example
of
the
style
and
as
one
of
the
most
easily
recognized
and
available
witbeirs
it
is
doing
the
style
justice
o
solid
and
very
drinkable
but
overall
pretty
plain
i
like
this
beer
particularly
in
warm
weather
its
very
nice
indeed
as
is
often
the
case
i
could
stand
for
the
mouthfeel
to
be
more
assertive
to
provide
a
better
foundation
for
the
flavors
its
a
little
too
light
i
think
for
my
taste
but
all
in
all
a
classic
that
deserves
its
standing
served
very
cold
in
22
ounce
mug
bright
yellow
and
hazy
in
appearance
very
appealing
color
but
poor
head
retention
and
zero
lacing
smells
really
interesting
even
for
a
wit
with
all
the
smells
from
a
bowl
of
fruit
loops
taste
was
strangely
spicy
on
the
front
end
and
then
refreshingly
sweet
and
fruity
on
the
finish
thin
in
the
mouth
but
bubbly
somehow
i
was
really
thirsty
and
this
beer
hit
the
spot
i
loved
it
so
much
i
decided
to
brew
my
own
version
of
it
way
better
than
the
more
widely
available
coors
version
of
the
same
style
o
this
seems
like
a
loveitorhateit
the
spicing
is
probably
too
bold
for
those
who
prefer
more
subtle
flavorings
but
those
who
like
things
up
close
and
personal
would
probably
love
it
i
can
appreciate
both
depending
on
the
beer
but
i
fall
into
the
love
it
column
on
this
one
another
one
of
the
mix
six
beers
i
am
going
to
review
a
odd
color
reminds
me
of
hazy
pear
or
pineapple
juice
with
a
wispy
head
a
nice
aroma
of
citrus
and
bananas
taste
is
typical
to
the
style
and
is
well
balanced
it
is
a
nice
beer
that
for
me
would
have
been
better
on
a
warmer
day
will
have
again
not
having
tried
erdinger
or
maisel
recently
i
can
honestly
say
that
its
my
least
favorite
wheat
beer
this
ale
is
easy
to
like
and
very
hard
to
hate
ive
had
hoegaarden
both
from
the
bottle
and
on
tap
and
ive
never
noticed
a
significant
difference
between
them
i
enjoy
mine
with
a
slice
and
squirt
of
orange
as
others
have
noted
hoegaarden
might
not
be
quite
as
good
as
competitors
like
allagash
white
but
its
cheaper
and
always
refreshing
o
the
beer
that
will
convince
almost
anyone
who
hates
beer
that
theres
more
than
light
beers
and
ipas
to
choose
from
a
good
summer
beer
best
enjoyed
neither
too
cold
nor
too
warm
the
bottle
is
a
bit
small
at
11
2
ounces
however
thats
not
entirely
uncommon
for
imports
o
i
bought
a
six
pack
a
while
ago
when
i
was
first
experimenting
with
new
beers
this
is
a
pretty
decent
macro
honestly
a
bit
bland
but
fairly
sessionable
and
imo
better
than
some
of
the
other
belgian
whit
macros
like
shocktop
and
rickards
white
id
happily
drink
another
and
if
i
was
having
non
craft
guests
over
id
buy
some
and
enjoy
it
with
them
o
very
drinkable
solid
wit
one
of
my
goto
beers
overall
this
was
good
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
straw
and
our
vigorous
pour
provides
a
pillowy
head
of
white
foam
wheat
and
coriander
and
orange
peel
dominate
the
nose
with
hints
of
lemongrass
and
spice
the
lemony
aromas
take
charge
on
the
palate
the
initial
zestfulness
gives
way
to
wheat
and
bready
malt
flavors
on
the
way
to
a
spicy
finish
that
showcases
coriander
clove
and
orange
zest
lively
carbonation
and
a
lighter
body
its
hard
to
complain
with
this
beer
for
the
price
and
ubiquity
this
beer
has
few
faults
sure
there
may
be
better
examples
of
the
style
ommegang
and
st
bernardus
spring
to
mind
but
hoegaarden
can
go
toe
to
toe
with
the
best
wits
and
it
will
hold
up
well
in
my
opinion
sometimes
you
just
want
a
quick
refreshing
beer
that
you
can
share
with
anyone
for
those
days
hoegaarden
will
always
be
near
great
beer
to
start
people
on
as
well
the
first
time
i
encountered
this
probably
early
2008
i
thought
it
smelled
like
a
complete
disaster
the
times
have
changed
this
is
a
classic
and
it
is
certainly
has
its
charms
its
extremely
light
but
it
works
its
not
top
tier
thanks
a
lot
allagash
white
for
demolishing
the
competition
but
its
certainly
way
better
than
blue
moon
this
is
the
standard
of
all
wit
beers
smooth
taste
is
great
and
no
lingering
bitterness
perfect
its
not
extreem
in
flavor
or
alcohol
content
so
many
will
under
rate
this
brew
if
you
want
a
witbeer
that
has
drinkability
unmatched
flavor
so
smooth
taste
so
perfect
this
is
the
beer
3
5
d
a
decent
witbier
with
an
inviting
aroma
but
falls
off
the
mark
with
a
fairly
thin
and
flat
taste
cant
really
compare
this
to
the
more
full
flavoured
options
out
there
beer
is
mediumlight
in
body
with
plentiful
but
soft
carbonation
that
results
in
a
soft
foamy
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
enjoyable
closes
semidry
with
light
stickiness
lingering
across
the
palate
very
drinkable
repeatedly
exceptionally
inviting
here
nice
a
decent
belgian
wit
that
i
find
to
be
highly
drinkable
it
looks
good
and
the
aromaflavour
have
welljudged
notes
of
fruit
and
spice
was
expecting
higher
carbonation
but
this
is
a
fairly
trivial
point
it
is
possible
that
hoegaarden
has
become
somewhat
muted
through
abinbev
ownership
but
it
still
comes
across
as
well
crafted
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
and
deserves
to
be
sampled
reliable
beer
i
always
like
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
not
overly
sweet
flavorful
and
still
refreshing
and
now
it
is
easily
available
in
brazil
at
a
decent
price
given
ambev
distribution
3
55
o
a
tasty
witbier
that
is
smooth
and
refreshing
i
enjoy
having
this
beer
in
warm
summer
weather
but
its
lack
of
complexity
does
not
leave
me
craving
more
i
will
certainly
have
it
again
but
not
one
of
my
goto
beers
overall
3
5
good
witbier
nothing
fantastic
but
absolutely
nothing
wrong
this
is
a
classic
and
rightly
so
but
there
are
bigger
and
better
wits
and
wheats
out
there
to
be
had
watch
the
price
though
a
friend
of
mine
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
these
at
publix
and
paid
almost
10
for
them
which
is
insane
you
could
buy
a
brew
your
own
kit
for
wheats
for
25
and
make
50
or
so
beers
that
would
taste
as
good
as
this
hoe
o
this
is
extremely
clean
and
refreshing
i
wish
i
was
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
i
could
drink
this
anytime
for
some
refreshment
another
one
of
the
mix
six
beers
i
am
going
to
review
a
odd
color
reminds
me
of
hazy

or

with
a

head
a
nice
aroma
of
citrus
and

is
well

it
is
a
nice
beer
that
for
me
would
have
been
better
on
a
warmer
day
will
have
again
o
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
and
well
balanced
would
make
a
great
summer
time
option
mouthfeel
was
almost
perfect
drank
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
good
appearance
a
murky
yellow
color
thick
white
head
that
lasted
the
entire
drinking
time
the
smell
is
decent
with
a
strong
lemon
and
mild
touch
of
banana
mild
carbonation
with
a
smooth
feel
tastes
like
it
smells
i
agree
with
others
that
this
would
be
a
good
ale
to
drop
an
orange
slice
in
and
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
descent
witbier
easy
drinking
and
good
flavor
would
i
buy
it
again
yes
this
is
a
true
summers
beer
at
the
moment
it
is
not
summer
but
it
is
nice
regardless
would
love
to
have
this
ice
cold
on
a
terrace
outside
when
it
is
really
hot
though
o
decent
but
nothing
to
seek
out
for
the
style
id
much
prefer
ayingers
wheat
beers
overall
this
ia
a
beer
that
definitly
needs
the
help
of
some
citrus
fruit
taste
is
wheat
and
coriander
and
the
finish
is
pretty
spicey
and
dry
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
drinkability
is
quite
high
although
compared
to
german
hefeweizen
the
tastes
are
more
rough
in
this
one
but
still
a
good
session
beer
i
always
enjoy
this
though
its
slightly
reminiscent
of
drinking
lemonade
simple
and
pleasing
but
nothing
outstanding
decent
witbier
refreshing
and
easy
on
the
palate
this
is
something
that
would
be
very
sessionable
surprising
complexity
on
the
nose
with
a
nice
finish
o
available
pretty
much
everywhere
good
light
easy
drinking
beer
how
can
you
go
wrong
its
hard
to
honestly
be
impressed
by
a
beer
thats
taken
me
so
long
to
actually
try
my
brother
in
law
left
half
a
12pk
here
so
i
figured
why
not
not
very
unique
and
not
that
different
from
most
witbiers
very
good
beer
exactly
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
as
a
belgian
wheat
highly
recommend
as
an
easy
drinking
lighter
beer
mouth
feel
full
of
frothy
bubbles
o
well
balanced
the
touch
of
lemon
adds
personality
classic
i
know
i
didnt
give
it
a
full
review
but
this
is
one
of
the
only
beers
out
of
hundreds
i
didnt
like
overallvery
nice
beer
extremely
satisfied
considering
the
price
paid
about
8
50
for
a
sixpack
overall
very
enjoyable
beer
i
have
had
it
several
times
before
and
never
really
paid
much
attention
to
it
until
now
for
a
mainstream
import
its
pretty
good
i
will
have
this
beer
again
o
for
the
style
it
does
the
things
it
must
do
for
a
witbier
nothing
stands
out
to
make
this
beer
exemplary
although
drinking
a
few
would
rarely
be
a
hindrance
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
weissbiers
unlike
most
wheat
beers
this
has
a
lighter
white
color
to
it
instead
of
citrusy
notes
this
beer
has
more
of
a
berry
note
to
it
ive
enjoyed
it
out
of
the
bottle
and
even
more
so
from
the
tap
even
after
having
many
beers
overseas
this
still
remains
amongst
the
top
wheat
beers
in
the
world
at
least
from
what
ive
tried
a
good
beer
for
the
summer
rotation
this
beer
pours
up
a
very
weak
looking
straw
color
with
a
three
finger
head
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
oranges
and
some
bready
notes
mouthfeel
would
be
kind
of
watery
except
for
the
carbonation
taste
is
very
typical
wheat
beer
with
some
citrus
there
just
arent
enough
hops
as
the
dominant
flavor
is
sweet
malt
just
kind
of
average
all
the
way
around
o
a
beautiful
widely
available
witbier
lacks
some
characteristics
of
the
style
although
very
balanced
taste
which
makes
it
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
the
lable
on
the
bottle
recommends
drinking
it
at
23c
which
i
found
a
little
cold
i
let
it
warm
up
to
about
10c
which
really
supports
a
broader
flavour
and
brings
out
the
citrusyflavours
more
overall
a
good
classic
but
i
prefer
other

4
0
to
me
this
is
a
largely
overrated
beer
granted
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
wits
but
i
really
dont
think
hoegaarden
has
as
much
depth
as
some
of
the
better
beers
in
this
style
it
feels
light
but
that
floral
taste
is
just
overwhelming
a
little
more
lemon
zest
would
be
nice
something
o
this
witbier
seems
to
be
the
most
popular
of
all
offerings
within
the
style
and
for
good
reason
it
showcases
a
pretty
tasty
flavor
with
a
nice
enjoyable
level
of
spice
and
is
just
a
good
allaround
belgian
ale
theres
no
doubt
that
i
could
enjoy
a
few
more
of
these
brews
during
this
time
of
year
and
definitely
look
forward
to
having
one
again
soon
great
beer
not
really
much
more
to
say
about
it
if
youve
had
a
blue
moon
hoegaarden
white
is
basically
like
it
the
only
difference
is
when
adding
the
lemon
slice
it
has
a
bit
more
tart
to
it
a
little
bubblier
mouth
feel
and
a
little
harder
to
swallow
but
overall
a
great
beer
i
accidentally
poured
from
the
bottle
too
fast
so
i
had
to
wait
for
the
beer
to
unfizz
in
a
sense
to
pour
the
rest
in
but
the
head
lasted
nicely
and
the
aroma
was
very
lemony
like
i
previously
said
just
a
great
beer
o
very
drinkable
cant
really
argue
with
a
classic
witbier
o
this
may
not
my
thing
but
its
certainly
decent
for
the
style
not
a
expressive
as
some
but
id
down
one
of
these
in
a
pinch
if
i
was
a
wit
guy
i
suppose
price
point
8
596pk
spicy
and
peppery
upfront
flavor
smooth
feel
but
thin
im
not
a
fan
of
wheats
but
this
one
seems
to
fit
the
profile
very
well
had
a
bottle
of
this
at
ginza
aster
in
ginza
tokyo
poured
into
a
hoegaarden
widemouthed
pint
glass
pours
a
beautiful
cloudy
wheat
hue
with
a
thick
white
tasty
head
on
it
strong
presence
of
hops
wheat
and
other
florals
as
well
as
some
orange
and
bitters
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
enough
leaving
me
with
the
sense
that
this
was
a
quality
belgian
witbier
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
before
i
started
to
get
tired
of
the
wheat
flavor
overall
a
great
ubiquitous
option
for
brews
overall
good
and
very
refreshing
on
tap
at
kreegans
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
with
little
head
more
of
a
bad
pour
than
a
characteristic
of
the
beer
also
served
with
a
lemon
that
i
discarded
the
nose
was
a
pleasant
lemony
zesty
coriander
very
nice
quite
spicy
the
taste
followed
suit
with
lots
of
lemon
peel
and
spiciness
coriander
and
kind
of
white
pepper
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
thin
but
finished
quite
crisp
and
refreshing
the
spiciness
really
makes
the
beer
and
complements
the
fruit
well
great
beer
for
the
summertime
absolutely
delicious
with
a
delicious
fruity
aromas
this
beer
has
a
definite
citrus
and
tangy
flavour
that
cannot
be
missed
it
is
a
great
summer
quencher
and
looks
cloudy
on
appearance
i
thought
it
was
supposed
to
be
drunk
with
a
slice
of
lime
but
it
tasted
nice
even
without
it
definitely
would
try
it
again
overall
i
have
had
a
number
of
belgian
white
ales
and
this
is
certainly
a
step
above
many
of
the
typical
contenders
this
beer
fits
right
in
the
middle
of
mediocre
and
excellent
it
does
not
disappoint
but
it
is
good
to
keep
trying
other
white
ales
as
well
o
behind
that
hark
back
to
country
life
thing
this
beer
evokes
theres
an
urban
sophistication
lurking
up
comes
this
wonderfully
oily
complex
urbanlakefront
chicago
urban
coastline
battery
vancouver
vibe
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
says
theres
more
here
if
you
just
take
the
time
overall
ive
heard
about
this
beer
for
a
long
time
and
its
pretty
solid
and
seems
to
hold
up
to
its
reputation
great
summer
beer
with
lots
of
flavor
there
is
one
word
to
explain
this
beer
delicious
i
party
a
lot
so
i
typically
wont
buy
something
with
such
a
price
tag
unless
i
am
only
treating
myself
to
it
which
is
exactly
what
happened
one
sip
of
this
and
i
wouldnt
let
anybody
else
near
it
i
am
typically
weary
of
trying
foreign
beer
after
i
bought
dirty
bastard
which
had
the
opposite
effect
probably
the
best
tasting
beer
i
have
ever
had

is

witbiers
but
this
one
serves
as
being
generally
strong
in
every
category
and
would
be
an
excellent
step
for
anybody
who
isnt
looking
for
intensity
but
who
would
like
to
find
something
more
interesting
and
more
satisfying
than
the
mass
produced
water
beers
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
with
a
huge
frothy
head
there
are
notes
of
orange
and
coriander
in
the
nose
but
they
are
relatively
reserved
the
taste
is
mild
wheat
malt
with
hints
of
citrus
and
spice
easy
on
the
palate
and
supremely
drinkable
this
one
is
a
classic
it
may
not
be
the
boldest
witbier
but
it
is
easy
one
of
the
most
drinkable
finally
picked
this
up
to
complete
a
6pack
in
san
diego
although
this
is
probably
the
quintessential
benchmark
of
the
style
i
feel
many
u
s
brewers
have
passed
them
up
although
the
appearance
and
nose
are
pretty
well
nailed
on
this
brew
the
flavor
was
marginal
at
best
at
times
i
was
vividly
reminded
of
those
emergenc
powder
packets
that
you
mix
with
water
not
worth
the
price
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
o
goes
down
easy
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
nice
representation
of
style
the
php
is
in
summer
season
and
this
was
a
nice
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
afternoon
o
not
a
big
fan
of
witbiers
but
this
is
not
bad
im
not
a
fan
of
the
traditional
belgian
spiciness
but
its
not
too
bad
in
this
one
light
and
refreshing
id
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
nice
carbonation
level
plays
well
with
the
light
body
and
lighter
flavors
overall
again
this
is
a
very
average
witbier
a
true
benchmark
for
the
style
if
you
brew
a
better
wit
than
this
then
your
beet
is
above
average
nice
translucid
color
yellow
poured
in
a
pint
glass
medium
white
head
with
good
retention
thru
the
whole
test
it
has
an
aroma
mixed
of
spices
citrus
and
wheat
taste
is
not
of
my
preferences
but
i
enjoyed
the
experience
maybe
i
am
not
going
to
drink
this
regularly
pure
white
head
barely
reaches
half
a
finger
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
sizzles
down
to
nothing
quickly
no
lacing
looks
like
a
tight
array
of
ball
bearings
sliding
down
the
glass
side
while
the
liquid
is
the
palest
of
yellows
its
glow
and
ability
to
hold
light
inside
amplifies
its
presence
reaches
a
gauzy
opacity
haphazard
large
bubbles
whiz
upwards
the
wheat
is
gentle
in
the
nose
a
drying
supplement
to
the
base
of
orange
and
lemon
citrus
caraway
coriander
cinnamon
and
dried
yeasts
and
baking
dough
apricots
and
pears
underneath
bare
whiff
of
banana
without
impairing
cleanliness
subtly
steady
length
mediumbodied
semisluggish
and
apt
to
just
plop
down
on
the
tongue
even
allowing
for
a
slight
prickle
from
the
carbonation
the
anise
coriander
cumin
spice
supplemented
by
vanilla
bean
these
elements
contribute
to
a
sweetness
throughout
that
lemon
orange
citrus
peach
and
apricot
pulp
maybe
melon
or
apple
too
a
few
bubblegum
notes
wheat
and
grains
appear
about
midway
to
dry
out
the
palate
keeps
a
steady
message
without
too
many
moving
parts
user
friendly
and
not
out
to
overtly
challenge
anyone
light
flavor
profile
slight
malts
coriander
hint
of
cinammon
snappy
finish
wraps
it
up
nicely
a
refreshing
wit
but
on
the
understated
side
o
refreshing
and
enjoyable
i
could
see
drinking
this
beer
once
a
day
during
the
summer
months
recommended
people
tell
me
to
never
trust
a
belgian
i
can
believe
it
now
as
i
have
a
foggy
yellow
glass
chilled
yet
i
still
think
the
bartender
got
this
from
a
guy
who
visited
the
mens
room
while
a
bit
dehydrated
the
head
is
a
pure
white
like
the
clouds
that
takes
a
bit
of
time
to
dissipate
the
flavor
is
smooth
yet
overwhelming
i
taste
sausage
sausage
and
more
sausage
now
that
you
mention
it
i
have
not
had
a
traditional
european
breakfast
for
an
extended
period
that
very
much
out
stretches
the
length
of
my
own
sausage
its
almost
salty
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
but
very
much
would
go
with
my
garlic
seasoned
sunny
side
up
eggs
and
perhaps
a
piece
of
the
toast
with
the
real
butter
from
next
door
and
not
the
grocery
there
is
a
medium
carbonation
and
the
lace
is
still
apparent
it
would
be
much
more
pleasurable
if
it
was
the
morning
as
it
should
be
waiting
for
me
whenever
i
roll
out
of
bed
from
now
on
i
will
only
trust
a
german
freshness
date
printed
january
7th
its
march
24th
so
despite
its
average
mouthfeel
its
still
pretty
damn
good
ill
be
having
this
one
tomorrow
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
but
light
flavors
and
aromas
oobviously
this
beer
is
not
for
me
i
honestly
would
prefer
an
aal
with
a
lime
ouch
overall
crisp
and
clean
this
refreshing
beer
is
just
begging
for
a
barbecue
to
be
enjoyed
with
o
overall
a
decent
witbier
the
nose
is
pretty
nice
though
the
taste
isnt
very
flavorful
and
a
bit
bland
very
easy
to
drink
not
really
something
i
would
seek
out
again
but
something
i
would
certainly
drink
again
if
i
had
a
limited
selection
and
was
looking
for
a
light
beer
this
beer
has
a
pale
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
lays
down
quickly
the
smell
is
a
little
of
wheat
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
little
citrus
with
a
tab
bit
of
spice
i
think
it
is
coriander
the
mouth
feel
is
easy
drinking
and
overall
a
ok
beer
o
nothing
particularly
complex
but
really
nice
all
elements
of
a
belgian
wit
nicely
portrayed
there
are
better
but
for
a
wit
that
can
be
found
in
most
grocery
stores
its
pretty
great
love
it
overall
its
hard
for
me
to
pass
up
a
hoegaarden
when
i
have
the
opportunity
just
a
very
solid
beer
that
i
dont
think
id
ever
get
tired
of
very
drinkable
beer
poured
from
11
2
oz
bottle
into
glass
a
nice
golden
cloudy
appearance
with
a
large
white
head
smells
very
bready
very
smooth
mouthfeel
but
doesnt
linger
long
very
well
balanced
taste
with
points
of
light
bitterness
sweetness
and
a
little
sour
in
there
as
well
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
not
the
best
wit
out
there
pretty
run
of
the
mill
o
i
try
not
to
talk
dirty
of
beers
i
dont
like
but
im
not
exactly
kicking
a
dead
puppy
by
scorning
this
multi
award
winning
macro
travesty
along
with
stella
artois
i
think
its
one
of
the
most
overrated
beers
in
the
world
and
its
really
expensive
so
i
make
no
apologies
for
saying
its
genuinely
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
quaffable
beer
but
light
and
ultimately
not
flavorful
ill
pass
in
the
future
not
something
id
have
ever
bought
myself
it
does
nothing
to
convince
me
that
i
should
explore
the
style
further
i
may
enjoy
one
of
these
after
doing
yard
work
but
there
are
so
many
other
brews
available
with
a
lot
more
going
on
in
them
it
wasnt
bad
just
really
boring
pours
a
murky
light
orange
with
a
12
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
small
chunks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
banana
spices
and
some
yeast
aromas
taste
is
of
wheat
banana
and
yeast
the
spices
come
through
on
the
aftertaste
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
witbier
that
is
tasty
and
very
easy
drinking
a
good
example
of
the
witbier
style
but
i
plan
on
exploring
more
audacious
offerings
in
the
style
as
well
as
modern
classics
like
st
bernardus
which
has
brewmaster
celis
as
an
advisor
pale

one

good
feel
nice
and
easy
drinking
havent
had
this
in
a
while
and
dont
remember
it
being
as
good
as
this
i
would
have
this
again
down
the
road
though
o
before
i
got
into
beer
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
one
nope
just
an
average
one
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
to
the
smell
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
wheat
very
short
lived
almost
lacking
but
the
perfume
of
the
yeast
comes
through
nicely
however
the
beer
is
rarely
watery
but
again
very
drinkable
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
a
nice
sessionable
belgian
wit
thats
a
good
alternative
to
american
light
lager
if
youre
into
that
sort
of
thing
overall
an
excellent
witbier
flavorful
and
refreshing
and
nice
looking
as
well
highly
recommended
overall
i
love
this
beer
it
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
with
no
pretense
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
beer
on
tap
at
on
milwaukees
east
side
hadnt
had
this
beer
in
a
while
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
it
and
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
it
again
the
next
time
im
confronted
by
the
likes
of
what
i
saw
at
a
bww
cant
beleive
i
never
reviewed
this
great
warm
weather
beer
but
im
having
one
in
january
bright
white
foam
nice
lacing
and
a
hazy
straw
yellow
color
looks
great
smells
of
wheat
a
little
fruity
almost
citrus
like
taste
of
wheat
citrus
some
banana
in
there
this
is
a
great
wheat
beer
i
wish
i
could
have
had
it
in
its
prime
before
it
was
bought
out
o
while
i
prefer
more
depth
in
my
beer
this
is
not
to
bad
as
wheat
beers
go
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
stella
chalice
was
a
part
of
the
binnys
beers
of
the
world
gift
set
for
me
this
is
the
benchmark
wit
easy
to
find
no
extremes
and
quite
good
nothing
i
would
turn
my
nose
up
at
but
certainly
not
a
great
wit
this
beer
smells
and
tastes
quite
good
presentation
packaged
in
a
custom
11
2
ounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
frozen
hoegaarden
hexagonal
tumbler
per
the
recommendation
on
the
label
overall
this
is
a
decent
run
repeatable
qualities
are
perhaps
not
abundant
but
a
man
might
as
well
let
this
dance
across
his
face
once
you
only
live
once
pour
em
in
love
poured
a
cloudy
whiteyellowish
color
decent
white
head
but
unfortunatelty
never
really
sticks
around
leaving
no
reminents
smells
of
oranges
wheat
bubblegum
other
citrus
taste
is
light
wheat
and
orange
up
front
with
a
bit
of
lemony
citrus
flavors
also
present
mouthfeel
is
light
and
watery
with
prickly
carbonation
good
taste
crisp
citrusy
definitely
could
drink
many
and
often
my
love
for
this
beer
hasnt
changed
one
bit
probably
the
best
bmc
technically
bmc
but
it
tastes
too
good
to
be
has
to
offer
benchmark
for
a
wit
should
be
d
hoegaarden
was
in
all
likelihood
my
first
beer
that
wasnt
a
lager
it
was
also
the
beer
that
turned
me
onto
craft
beer
although
it
might
not
be
as
great
as
it
used
to
be
in
my
eyes
itll
always
hold
a
place
in
my
heart
nice
simple
flavor
nothing
off
really
easy
to
drink
and
makes
a
perfect
summer
beer
im
confident
that
no
matter
where
my
journeys
through
the
world
of
beer
take
me
this
will
always
remain
a
constant
in
my
fridge
and
in
my
heart
unfortunately
since
those
experiences
my
affection
for
hoegaarden
has
steadily
deteriorated
i
dont
know
if
it
is
due
to
loss
of
character
and
flavor
because
of
the
transport
from
belgium
to
the
u
s
or
because
i
have
now
had
several
other
excellent
witbiers
regardless
hoegaarden
no
longer
impresses
me
the
same
way
sure
it
still
stands
as
the
hallmark
of
the
style
and
im
not
sure
ive
ever
seen
such
a
beautiful
pale
white
glow
in
any
other
beer
but
now
when
i
drink
it
the
beer
seems
to
be
too
watery
and
thin
and
the
unique
flavors
seem
to
be
far
too
muted
still
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
one
poured
this
witbier
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
produced
a
decent
white
head
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
left
behind
the
aroma
is
unique
for
a
witbier
a
shot
of
cracked
pepper
and
citrus
lemon
the
beer
is
light
in
body
mouthfeel
is
smooth
flavor
of
soft
wheat
spicy
pepper
and
lemon
zest
after
some
research
i
found
that
the
pepper
flavor
originates
from
the
yeast
strain
they
use
and
the
sour
lemon
flavor
is
from
the
hop
additions
great
beer
probably
the
closest
that
youll
find
to
the
original
of
the
style
never
a
bad
choice
to
fall
back
on
prost
overall
been
drinking
this
beer
for
a
good
45
years
now
not
my
favorite
witbier
but
its
certainly
hits
the
spot
from
time
to
time
o
a
good
wit
extremely
drinkable
light
flavors
compared
to
a
great
nose
is
the
only
disappointing
part
to
this
beer
doa
overall
somewhat
of
a
spicy
beer
but
its
a
very
good
belgian
white
ale
one
of
my
favorites
pours
a
nice
yellowish
pale
white
color
about
a
one
finger
head
smells
of
banana
and
clove
with
different
spices
maybe
some
coriander
tastes
like
bananas
to
me
nice
and
smooth
finish
fine
carbonation
and
very
sessionable
a
good
beer
one
i
buy
quite
often
o
not
a
showstopper
but
it
is
an
originator
which
you
should
give
props
to
and
it
is
pretty
delicious
in
its
simplicity
im
not
sure
how
accurate
my
review
is
this
is
definitely
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
of
beer
im
just
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sweetness
tartness
and
lack
of
hops
if
i
had
to
drink
a
wheat
beer
i
would
probably
choose
one
of
a
german
style
everyone
tries
to
copy
this
white
ale
but
it
still
stands
distinctly
alone
as
the
original
for
me
cloudy
and
citrusy
smelling
with
a
big
pillowy
head
has
notes
of
spice
and
orange
cream
as
well
as
a
mellow
floral
hop
profile
lighter
body
makes
it
a
really
easy
session
but
only
when
its
super
cold
i
find
this
one
gets
a
little
bitter
and
funky
yeasty
when
it
warms
up
so
best
to
guzzle
it
down
well
its
still
chilly
too
expensive
for
what
it
is
but
a
great
white
hoegaarden
goes
down
with
they
best
though
i
recommend
a
keith
jarrett
solo
piano
recording
i
would
go
with
koln
or
lusannebremen
releases
this
is
amazing
stuff
if
you
see
it
in
your
grocery
store
get
it
all
in
all
not
bad
for
something
made
by
budweiser
o
though
the
quality
of
the
bottled
product
can
be
variable
i
still
think
hoegaarden
is
an
excellent
belgian
witbier
ive
been
drinking
it
for
several
years
and
have
not
been
able
to
detect
the
socalled
loss
of
character
that
other
reviewers
have
claimed
to
notice
i
would
love
to
have
this
in
belgium
to
see
if
its
better
over
there
decent
beer
but
it
has
some
huge
flaws
that
would
make
me
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
o
a
light
refreshing
drink
probably
better
suited
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
than
the
cool
autumn
evening
i
tried
it
o
not
bad
but
not
a
beer
i
will
reach
for
unless
i
have
to
taste
is
light
and
crisp
banana
bread
and
lemon
full
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
bitter
finish
for
a
big
brewery
its
decent
d
balanced
and
seamless
very
approachable
soft
and
pleasant
wits
have
been
taken
some
interesting
directions
but
it
is
easy
to
see
why
the
original
remains
a
benchmark
o
a
fantastic
refreshing
beer
that
is
superb
on
a
hot
day
a
great
session
beer
and
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favourites
for
me
so
far
the
king
of
wit
biers
great
balance
of
everything
pours
a
nice
hazy
lite
yellow
a
finger
of
head
sometimes
i
dont
get
much
on
the
aromatics
from
this
but
then
again
im
not
snorting
it
wonderful
mouthfeel
very
easy
to
drink
summer
drink
to
most
but
if
it
taste
good
consume
it
whenever
its
a
bit
pricey
to
gobble
down
in
a
session
or
two
but
might
just
be
worth
it
overall
witbiers
arent
my
favorite
style
and
this
one
certainly
is
subdued
it
smells
great
as
most
belgians
do
but
it
doesnt
transfer
to
the
taste
very
well
would
i
get
it
again
maybe
but
i
think
i
will
be
more
inclined
to
try
more
witbiers
from
here
on
out
o
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
a
nice
wheat
beer
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
beer
and
its
drinkability
is
world
top
overall
very
sessionable
but
i
prefer
heavier
more
malty
tasting
beers
i
can
see
why
this
does
well
on
tap
o
i
feel
like
i
owe
this
beer
a
massive
thank
you
not
the
best
wit
out
there
but
for
a
time
i
thought
this
was
the
best
beer
in
the
world
this
is
when
i
drank
all
the
macro
swill
this
beer
showed
me
there
is
better
out
there
and
was
my
first
step
into
better
beer
i
lost
my
good
beer
virginity
to
this
i
guess
you
could
say
o
not
really
my
type
of
beer
but
was
worth
trying
could
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
day
overall
i
got
a
six
pack
as
a
gift
and
boy
it
was
nice
i
will
pick
up
some
more
in
the
future
most
likely
in
the
summer
time
o
a
pleasant
hot
weather
thirst
quencher
very
sessionable
as
i
said
before
highly
drinkable
sessionable
even
modest
abv
decent
carbonation
fairly
short
finish
refreshing
not
gonna
make
a
ba
jump
through
hoops
but
a
good
choice
if
faced
with
the
standard
bmc
offerings
youll
see
this
one
at
a
lot
of
noncraft
bars
and
restaurants
overall
i
like
this
beer
even
though
i
dont
want
to
because
it
is
an
inbev
product
but
i
could
drink
this
beer
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
wasnt
for
that
now
i
have
to
wait
to
enjoy
this
beer
for
a
while
to
protest
the
evil
corp
lol
oh
well
d
this
beer
is
a
classic
which
goes
beyond
saying
and
it
should
be
tried
by
all
who
like
this
style
and
it
could
be
an
intro
beer
to
those
who
are
hesitant
to
try
anything
other
then
domestic
or
heineken
i
have
had
better
witbiers
but
it
is
still
refreshing
and
delicious
served
cold
overall
impression
it
is
a
nice
summer
time
beer
light
and
refreshing
had
this
after
working
in
the
yard
and
it
hit
the
spot
will
definitely
keep
in
the
fridge
during
summers
from
now
on
o
i
just
like
this
beer
it
has
a
good
flavor
it
a
great
summer
beer
happy
that
i
got
a
chance
to
drink
it
this
summer
overall
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
drinkable
fits
the
style
well
and
is
quite
tasty
o
a
good
beer
for
sunny
days
but
you
keep
thinking
there
must
be
a
better
one
out
there
o
overall
this
is
a
fine
fine
beer
i
think
i
still
prefer
allagash
white
but
this
beer
is
a
great
wit
nonetheless
a
wonderful
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
but
i
could
drink
it
any
time
pours
a
cloudy
light
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
malts
and
wheat
tickle
the
nose
with
some
hints
of
citrus
there
is
a
good
taste
to
the
beer
with
nice
blend
of
wheats
malts
and
lemon
zest
that
its
difficult
to
pick
out
certain
elements
as
they
blend
so
nicely
together
a
little
too
watery
but
nothing
to
fuss
about
a
nice
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
especially
for
those
hot
summer
days
o
well
orchestrated
witbier
very
crisp
and
refreshing
nothing
overwhelming
but
a
solid
all
round
beer
overall
why
yes
i
am
partial
to
wits
especially
hoegaarden
yes
i
know
there
are
better
ones
out
there
but
try
and
find
alagash
white
in
dayeffingtona
not
gonna
happen
hoegaarden
however
can
be
bought
at
publix
as
an
afterthought
to
your
grocery
list
just
when
youve
started
to
dread
heading
back
out
into
the
molten
parking
lot
yes
it
will
be
hot
but
there
will
be
a
cold
wit
on
the
porch
when
you
get
home
o
a
decent
everyday
offering
definitely
better
out
there
not
a
refreshing
as
some
my
and
a
lot
of
other
peoples
im
sure
goto
witbier
not
the
best
by
far
a
little
too
sweet
imo
looks
pretty
terrible
compared
to
others
but
still
delicious
and
a
great
benchmark
to
compare
others
to
overall
the
brew
is
light
and
eminently
quaffable
sliding
down
with
expected
belgian
fruitspice
ease
though
massproduced
this
beer
is
surprisingly
flavorful
and
interesting
mouthfeel
is
light
on
this
makes
it
very
drinkable
alcohol
is
in
the
average
range
so
you
can
easily
enjoy
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
its
mildly
refreshing
certainly
provides
much
of
the
draw
to
this
beer
overall
im
not
blown
away
by
it
but
i
can
see
where
this
would
be
the
quintessential
starter
for
the
style
prosit
o
great
session
brew
low
abv
complex
tasty
pours
out
a
very
carbonated
white
frothy
head
thats
about
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
cloudy
golden
in
color
you
can
deffinatly
smell
the
lemon
and
almost
a
sweetness
taste
is
somewhat
watery
even
for
a
white
ale
the
lemon
deffinatly
stands
out
right
away
dries
out
into
the
orange
peel
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
almost
feels
like
a
champaign
overall
an
ok
beer
for
those
who
like
a
beer
they
can
drink
all
night
long
a
beer
i
would
deffinatly
recommend
if
you
like
white
ales
ive
had
this
before
but
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
it
was
even
better
out
of
the
tap
perfect
for
the
summer
not
a
bad
witbier
at
all
and
certainly
better
than
the
other
offerings
on
tap
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
a
flavorful
experience
but
hoegaarden
is
a
perfectly
serviceable
brew
and
still
miles
and
miles
ahead
of
that
adjunct
dross
that
passes
for
beer
at
most
bars
today
food
match
im
gonna
put
it
out
there
grilled
salmon
with
a
light
salad
and
a
fried
potato
cake
thats
right
o
a
very
good
witbier
less
spicy
and
a
little
sweeter
than
its
american
counterparts
but
just
as
tasty
and
overall
better
than
most
witbiers
ive
tried
hard
to
evaluate
the
appearance
of
a
beer
in
a
plastic
cup
but
it
looked
run
of
the
mill
pale
orange
with
some
cloudiness
and
a
decent
head
lemony
smell
was
evident
beer
was
crisp
and
very
drinkable
with
powerful
lemonycitrusy
flavor
for
a
white
beer
i
dont
generally
like
to
associate
beers
with
seasons
if
its
good
its
good
but
there
was
something
very
clearly
summery
about
this
one
would
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
day
very
good
for
its
style
pours
out
a
yellowish
cloudy
body
with
a
creamy
white
head
the
lacing
and
retention
are
good
on
this
beer
the
nose
consists
of
lemon
peel
hay
biscuit
and
wheat
the
taste
starts
out
with
a
lemony
hops
taste
along
with
some
spices
pepper
yeast
and
biscuit
the
mouthfeel
is
a
crisp
clean
smooth
finish
that
makes
this
a
good
choice
for
a
summer
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
and
of
course
i
never
turn
down
a
free
beer
o
ive
had
this
one
on
several
occasions
i
think
the
tulip
glass
really
helped
this
one
out
i
dont
remember
this
beer
being
this
good
edit
82911
this
version
of
hoegaarden
is
far
better
on
tap
which
earns
a
b
it
tasted
exactly
like
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
but
overall
it
tasted
great
it
tasted
of
lemon
grass
citrus
wheat
malt
bread
grainy
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
which
definetely
confirmed
that
this
is
a
summer
beer
i
have
tasted
the
bottle
and
on
tap
and
i
feel
that
on
tap
the
beer
has
less
of
that
wit
taste
which
i
prefer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
found
it
to
be
lighter
in
flavor
to
my
two
favorite
witbier
beers
allagash
white
and
southampton
double
white
ale
i
did
like
it
better
than
blue
moon
which
i
found
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
for
my
liking
this
beer
would
go
perfect
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
youre
lounging
poolside
in
the
backyard
and
want
to
have
a
few
overall
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
white
ale
nicely
balanced
overall
an
above
average
whitewitbier
much
better
than
most
of
the
canadian
immitators
the
taste
is
mild
with
some
good
flavors
from
the
wheat
which
is
cereal
like
toasted
and
lightly
sweet
there
is
a
mild
citrus
tinge
and
hint
of
pepper
from
the
yeast
but
overall
this
is
flavored
primarily
from
the
wheat
which
has
a
nice
fresh
clean
flavor
the
yeast
adds
to
the
beer
without
being
to
full
to
make
it
feel
bready
which
i
like
this
is
a
good
wit
not
the
best
but
it
is
an
originator
it
has
lost
some
footing
to
others
in
this
style
which
i
prefer
like
allagash
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
this
since
it
is
pretty
widely
available
the
label
is
actually
pretty
cool
too
not
sure
what
it
means
but
when
i
was
sitting
at
the
bar
the
lady
beside
me
made
a
comment
about
it
i
actually
used
to
see
her
all
the
time
when
i
went
into
kinkos
she
is
just
a
super
nice
lady
anyway
the
beer
is
good
not
too
uncommon
as
most
liquor
stores
will
have
it
bottoms
up
people
because
this
beer
is
good
to
the
last
drop
overall
wheat
beers
arent
my
favorite
style
but
this
is
a
nice
approachable
wheat
it
has
a
great
spicy
taste
thats
a
bit
different
from
others
a
decent
beer
i
would
consider
buying
again
ive
had
this
beer
many
times
before
and
is
a
favorite
of
mine
in
the
summer
but
never
reviewed
it
until
having
some
at
brewfest
tonight
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
finger
head
that
fizzes
to
leave
little
lacing
smell
is
wheaty
with
some
hints
of
lemon
and
banana
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
malts
some
hops
wheat
lemon
and
banana
banana
and
a
nice
malty
backbone
prevail
in
the
finish
and
serve
to
give
a
nice
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
and
a
great
summer
brew
o
a
refrshing
crisp
drinking
beer
the
flavors
a
toned
down
quite
a
bit
but
it
has
a
real
nice
balance
pours
a
hazy
pale
with
a
bone
white
two
finger
head
as
it
dissipates
it
leaves
a
thin
film
of
froth
on
the
top
with
just
a
bit
of
lacing
aroma
is
assertive
on
the
coriander
and
orange
with
maybe
a
bit
of
lemon
and
wheat
in
the
background
flavor
is
tart
and
refreshing
orange
tartness
upfront
coriander
mid
palate
but
a
bit
of
a
watery
finish
not
much
length
decent
medium
carbonation
i
know
that
this
is
supposedly
the
first
belgian
white
ale
but
something
tells
me
over
the
years
of
being
bought
out
by
larger
companies
it
has
lost
something
along
the
way
and
become
a
more
watered
down
version
of
its
original
self
but
thats
just
speculation
i
guess
o
a
nice
affordable
and
easily
obtainable
wit
id
always
avoided
the
white
beers
assuming
the
would
be
too
light
to
intrigue
me
but
hoegaarden
opened
my
eyes
and
leaves
me
willing
to
try
some
more
witbiers
o
how
have
i
not
picked
this
up
before
this
really
is
one
of
the
best
hot
summer
day
brews
on
the
planet
easy
drinking
yet
with
plenty
of
flavor
when
i
poured
it
into
my
glass
it
was
a
hazy
pale
yellow
and
had
a
frothy
white
head
that
disappeared
quickly
the
first
thing
to
hit
my
nose
was
a
definite
sense
of
banana
and
yeast
after
another
sniff
or
two
i
picked
up
a
bit
of
citrus
the
flavor
of
the
beer
was
in
keeping
with
aroma
it
had
a
great
fruitybanana
flavor
as
well
as
a
prominent
yeastywheat
taste
there
was
also
a
light
citrus
flavor
that
gave
the
beer
crispness
combined
with
a
light
carbonated
body
i
found
this
beer
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
can
pick
up
the
spices
used
in
the
brewing
overall
i
like
this
beer
alot
as
a
whitte
beer
great
for
an
afternoon
outside
relaxing
with
friends
some
breadiness
and
an
lemon
is
beginning
to
creep
as
i
continue
to
sip
away
but
im
continued
to
be
underwhelmed
this
beer
never
wowed
me
but
i
remember
liking
previous
bottles
in
the
six
pack
a
lot
more
the
best
before
date
is
september
2012
so
freshness
cant
be
an
issue
maybe
its
just
a
bad
bottle
i
usually
deal
in
super
strong
hop
bombers
but
this
beer
for
its
genre
is
really
nice
it
almost
invites
itself
over
to
you
next
bbq
and
jumps
into
your
cooler
drink
me
its
97
degrees
outside
and
im
refreshing
if
this
beer
was
at
domestic
prices
here
in
alberta
id
drink
more
of
it
but
at
15
a
6er
its
pricy
compared
to
some
canadian
summer
offerings
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
vase
the
beer
is
a
bright
vibrant
yellow
color
with
a
ton
of
bubbles
and
a
thin
white
foamy
head
toasty
oat
aromas
both
mild
and
smooth
the
beer
was
served
ice
cold
so
i
had
to
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
before
delving
too
far
into
it
the
flavor
reveals
bready
and
spicy
characters
with
a
bit
of
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
smooth
creamy
banana
aftertaste
with
a
finish
of
crisp
and
bubbly
banana
creme
light
and
easy
to
drink
delicious
and
refreshing
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
turn
a
hoegaarden
down
i
have
had
this
before
and
will
almost
definitely
have
it
again
i
dont
buy
this
regularly
but
only
because
a
its
expensive
and
b
im
not
always
in
the
mood
for
spiciness
in
my
beer
when
i
am
in
the
mood
for
a
witbier
though
this
is
the
default
option
wow
this
is
different
my
first
witbier
looks
like
lemonade
with
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
quickly
carbonation
is
adequate
smell
is
orange
and
lemon
citrus
taste
is
refreshing
citrus
you
really
taste
the
corriander
slightly
creamy
pleasantly
refreshing
is
very
good
with
an
orange
slice
great
summer
brew
for
hot
weather
i
would
buy
this
one
again
glad
i
took
my
coworkers
recommendation
on
this
one
o
if
its
available
it
is
certainly
worth
drinking
but
would
like
more
from
a
belgian
beer
and
not
my
preferred
witbier
i
followed
the
directions
on
the
back
label
as
to
how
to
pour
this
beer
and
my
finger
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
seemed
to
evaporate
color
was
a
deeply
hazy
lemonyellow
like
freshsqueezed
grapefruit
juice
nose
had
all
of
the
attendant
spiciness
referred
to
on
the
label
as
a
subtle
hint
of
coriander
and
orange
peel
subtle
like
a
sledgehammer
between
the
eyes
for
the
uninitiated
the
yeast
gives
it
a
pleasant
mustiness
but
the
black
pepper
and
orange
zest
are
also
prevalent
on
the
nose
mouthfeel
seemed
kind
of
thin
and
it
had
a
nice
interplay
of
the
wheat
and
spices
on
the
tongue
somewhat
zesty
and
refreshing
finish
was
semidry
with
the
coriander
really
lingering
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
it
was
drinkable
but
i
am
not
a
raving
fan
well
its
a
classic
the
flavors
could
be
a
little
stronger
and
more
complex
but
theres
little
to
complain
about
here
its
tasty
and
refreshing
and
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
if
youre
not
looking
for
much
more
than
a
solid
quenching
beer
then
look
no
further
recommended
i
look
forward
to
my
next
pint
overall
an
average
beer
not
horrible
id
drink
it
again
if
no
better
options
are
available
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
typical
if
underachieving
whit
beer
d
this
is
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
and
a
lot
going
on
d
this
is
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
flavor
but
not
overly
draining
its
a
nice
change
from
hoppiness
to
the
fruitiness
for
a
beer
and
is
fitting
for
the
style
not
surprisingly
hoegaarden
is
a
real
joy
to
look
at
and
to
drink
it
is
cloudy
pale
in
colour
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
citrus
with
some
yeasty
notes
in
the
background
quite
a
flowery
taste
nectar
and
peppery
notes
with
a
malty
sweetness
smooth
as
silk
aftertaste
and
mouthfeel
low
hop
flavour
i
would
recommend
trying
it
with
a
slice
of
lemon
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
decent
beer
but
the
flavors
are
so
light
that
it
almost
misses
drinkable
and
enters
into
the
land
of
bland
r
i
p
pierre
celis
great
drinkability
definitely
o
i
think
there
are
better
wits
out
there
but
this
is
an
excellent
standard
to
judge
them
by
d
4
all
in
all
a
solid
offering
and
a
standby
due
to
its
high
availability
hoegaarden
is
a
classic
of
the
style
and
should
at
least
be
tried
by
all
though
not
supremely
complex
it
boasts
good
flavor
and
it
is
definitely
consistent
it
is
not
so
heavy
and
i
could
put
down
this
brew
with
ease
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
when
in
the
mood
it
is
a
good
one
to
fall
back
on
o
ok
why
does
this
have
a
b
rating
this
is
definitely
a
belowaverage
representative
of
the
style
overall
i
give
it
4
good
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
its
tasty
and
goes
down
easy
definitely
worth
keeping
in
mind
and
definitely
worth
trying
o
this
is
like
the
prototypical
witbier
but
with
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
aspects
emphasized
nice
fizzy
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
creamy
walls
of
lace
and
descent
retention
for
the
style
light
crisp
refreshing
body
nice
fizzy
carbonation
with
a
lemon
pepper
aroma
and
hints
of
citrus
orange
and
spice
black
pepper
notes
on
the
front
with
some
light
grainy
malt
backbone
lemon
and
orange
with
an
earthy
herbal
zest
overall
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
beer
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
one
of
my
favorites
it
is
a
lighter
beer
the
beer
had
a
very
nice
blend
of
spices
that
you
can
definetly
tell
are
present
but
not
too
overpowering
they
give
the
beer
a
great
flavor
and
help
it
to
finish
nice
and
crisp
with
no
unpleasant
aftertast
whatsoever
also
tried
in
a
bottle
the
spices
in
the
bottle
are
a
little
more
prominent
but
still
a
great
drink
id
would
say
the
beer
is
slightly
better
on
tap
when
compared
to
the
bottle
version
serving
type
bottle
dr
priced
fairly
by
irish
standards
but
not
a
fantastic
beer
a
nice
wit
that
i
guess
is
the
standard
for
witbiers
if
youre
a
blue
moon
drinker
try
this
instead
because
its
better
pour
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
that
retains
rather
well
light
wheat
aroma
with
citrus
notes
light
orange
and
lemon
zest
taste
with
smooth
bready
malts
that
are
somewhat
overcome
by
the
general
wheat
beer
harshness
acidic
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
light
body
and
easily
drinkable
o
overall
this
is
a
cant
miss
classic
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
witbier
although
allagash
white
is
maybe
a
bit
more
refined
i
find
this
much
zestier
and
more
flavorful
in
general
this
beer
is
extremely
refreshing
and
is
a
summer
classic
as
much
as
i
find
myself
skeptical
of
it
sometimes
on
the
shelves
it
never
fails
to
satisfy
and
at
8
39
a
6
pack
here
compared
to
9
99
for
an
allagash
4
pack
i
cant
fight
purchasing
im
really
writing
this
review
because
the
last
few
hoegaardens
ive
had
all
from
bottle
all
poured
into
hexagonal
hoegaarden
glass
have
really
hammered
home
that
this
is
an
abinbev
product
this
makes
me
sad
because
hoegaarden
was
one
of
the
first
beers
i
ever
really
liked
i
feel
that
its
quality
has
dropped
off
since
i
first
had
it
in
2006
in
particular
it
now
has
that
special
distinction
common
to
massproduced
beer
it
when
slightly
warmed
it
has
a
chalky
artificial
taste
that
makes
it
drinkable
only
when
very
cold
overall
i
still
very
much
appreciate
the
seasonings
added
to
this
beer
but
something
has
gone
wrong
here
with
the
wheat
yeast
hops
or
fermentation
and
i
see
myself
heavily
heavily
favoring
beers
like
allagash
white
over
hoegaarden
going
forward
a
terrific
summer
beer
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
its
a
common
beer
that
should
be
in
the
fridge
of
every
household
hoegaarden
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
my
first
thought
was
that
it
looked
like
a
very
cloudy
glass
of
lemonade
a
solid
three
fingers
of
frothy
white
foam
top
the
beer
and
come
up
to
the
rim
of
the
glass
before
slowly
creeping
back
down
towards
the
body
of
the
beer
lacing
is
a
bit
spotty
the
nose
is
surprisingly
coriander
forward
but
has
a
solid
orangecitrus
presence
as
well
finally
theres
a
touch
of
sweetness
from
the
wheat
to
complete
the
picture
everything
that
should
be
here
is
but
for
my
money
the
proportions
and
ratios
are
just
a
little
bit
off
if
the
nose
is
just
a
little
bit
out
of
whack
the
flavor
takes
that
imbalance
a
little
bit
further
its
not
quite
like
what
id
imagine
downing
a
bag
of
crushed
coriander
would
be
like
but
its
approaching
that
territory
it
takes
me
a
few
sips
to
make
it
past
that
and
enjoy
the
small
citrus
flourish
thats
present
as
well
theres
no
real
support
from
wheat
or
any
other
malt
to
rein
things
in
either
the
unquestioned
bright
spot
here
is
the
picturesque
light
body
and
active
carbonation
full
of
small
precise
bubbles
i
dont
recall
the
draft
pours
of
hoegaarden
ive
had
seeming
so
aggressively
coriander
dominant
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
reaching
for
a
bottle
of
this
any
time
soon
overall
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
this
beer
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
widely
commercially
available
whites
and
is
an
incredibly
pleasant
yet
subtly
flavorful
drink
well
recommended
o
you
could
have
many
of
these
and
be
satisfied
it
has
big
flavour
but
does
not
fill
you
up
like
other
wheatbeers
can
a
beer
for
everyone
i
loved
this
beer
this
beer
belongs
next
to
your
steak
grilled
outdoors
on
a
cool
summer
day
o
i
havent
had
a
hoegaarden
in
years
and
this
glass
was
much
better
than
i
remembered
the
beer
being
maybe
my
taste
evolved
maybe
the
recipe
changed
or
it
maybe
its
just
an
extrafresh
tap
either
way
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
very
sessionable
pours
a
nice
one
finger
head
looks
very
frothy
maybe
even
creamy
the
head
is
completely
white
and
the
body
is
a
hazy
clearishyellow
color
its
a
very
very
very
weird
body
it
looks
like
carbonated
lemonade
i
mean
its
cloudy
but
at
the
same
time
its
see
through
its
like
see
through
for
only
so
long
and
then
the
cloudiness
kicks
in
it
has
hues
of
orange
but
when
you
hold
it
up
to
the
light
it
looks
way
more
yellow
the
head
is
also
interesting
it
reminds
me
of
what
the
top
of
a
mocha
or
latte
would
look
like
so
thats
good
because
it
looks
creamy
overall
it
looks
super
weird
but
pretty
good
and
the
head
is
still
hanging
around
a
little
bit
this
bee
also
has
a
very
unique
smell
i
dont
think
ive
ever
smelled
something
as
unique
as
this
its
just
bursting
with
citrus
there
is
clearly
citrus
oranges
probably
lemons
and
definitely
coriander
all
the
citruses
are
there
and
they
are
pretty
recognizable
but
they
smell
a
lot
different
than
say
a
blue
moon
or
something
else
that
uses
the
same
ingredients
maybe
they
use
more
of
them
or
just
better
quality
not
sure
which
but
it
smells
really
good
and
really
unique
it
also
smell
really
clean
super
clean
and
probably
really
refreshing
overall
a
very
nice
aroma
very
tasty
i
dont
know
if
it
deserves
a
4
for
taste
but
either
way
it
is
super
tasty
and
super
unique
on
some
sips
there
isnt
much
flavor
but
on
others
its
just
bursting
with
flavor
you
get
all
the
flavors
that
were
indicated
on
the
smell
orange
lemon
coriander
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
a
tiny
bit
of
malts
but
who
really
cares
when
this
beer
is
so
tasty
the
only
reason
i
dont
want
to
give
this
a
4
is
because
it
is
a
little
light
and
watery
at
times
its
super
tasty
but
i
just
dont
think
it
deserves
a
4
mouthfeel
is
decent
nothing
too
outstanding
there
drinkability
is
pretty
good
i
mean
its
a
belgian
white
so
its
not
going
to
be
hard
to
put
away
overall
the
two
things
that
impressed
me
about
this
beer
is
how
unique
it
is
and
how
well
the
smell
represented
the
taste
pretty
damn
good
beer
overall
not
perfect
and
not
an
outstanding
beer
but
a
good
beer
that
i
have
very
little
to
complain
about
overall
good
place
to
start
for
wits
but
maybe
not
the
beall
endall
again
maybe
i
need
to
find
a
fresher
batch
and
rereview
but
i
wasnt
terribly
impressed
by
this
or
maybe
wheat
beers
just
arent
my
thing
as
im
discovering
its
worth
a
try
but
its
not
fantastic
o
i
still
love
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
its
a
solid
choice
in
its
category
i
could
drink
this
every
day
all
day
the
beer
was
a
light
hazy
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
receded
quickly
the
smell
has
banana
bubblegum
aroma
with
lemon
and
wheat
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
banana
and
bubblegum
i
also
tasted
orange
peel
wheat
and
grassy
hops
the
feel
is
light
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
could
drink
this
on
any
occasion
beer
distributor
15th
and
federal
philly
pa
d
very
drinkable
the
standard
of
the
style
o
the
most
average
witbier
available
the
most
widely
available
witbier
okay
maybe
blue
moon
wins
rip
pierre
thank
you
for
keeping
this
beer
and
the
style
alive
m
extremely
drinkable
and
perfectly
carbonated
just
a
little
thin
for
my
tastes
ok
ive
tried
hoegaarden
a
few
times
and
this
bottle
is
not
the
best
i
dont
know
if
its
old
or
what
but
im
going
to
skew
this
review
slightly
because
usually
its
great
it
has
a
really
different
color
than
most
beers
kind
of
like
a
cream
soda
life
saver
white
with
some
yellow
for
those
who
havent
had
that
particular
lifesaver
anyway
it
is
hazy
which
is
befitting
of
its
style
the
smell
is
very
original
too
kind
of
fruity
but
i
couldnt
tell
you
the
fruit
maybe
grapefruit
or
some
kind
of
grapes
i
think
the
taste
is
great
its
got
alot
of
body
from
the
wheat
with
a
tart
finish
on
the
tongue
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
too
taste
is
clean
and
on
the
crisper
more
refreshing
side
for
a
wheat
beer
definitely
not
very
hoppy
or
malty
just
clean
and
full
of
wheat
taste
fizzy
in
the
finish
its
not
a
great
beer
but
definitely
better
than
your
average
beer
found
at
your
average
bar
and
its
definitely
refreshing
availability
also
lifts
this
beer
up
in
my
mind
since
not
a
whole
lot
of
beers
like
this
are
extremely
popular
the
fact
that
it
can
be
found
in
a
lot
of
bars
and
nearly
always
on
liquor
beer
shelves
is
good
for
those
looking
to
broaden
their
beer
horizons
this
beer
was
one
of
the
first
wit
beers
i
ever
had
purchased
a
bottle
of
it
at
the
laystone
pub
in
bethlehem
pa
back
in
2007
this
beer
was
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
bright
white
head
the
beer
smells
very
refreshing
and
citrusy
the
beer
was
served
with
a
lemon
which
i
tried
it
without
it
first
it
wasnt
much
better
with
or
without
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
beer
is
great
for
sometime
o
once
of
my
favortie
whitbiers
for
its
crisp
cleanliness
final
notes
a
solid
wheat
beer
ill
be
returning
to
it
in
the
future
poured
into
a
radeberger
glass
with
a
very
hazy
pale
yellow
and
a
big
head
that
recedes
to
a
small
corner
molding
where
the
beer
meets
the
glass
smells
a
little
sour
with
lemony
hop
character
and
a
phenolic
yeast
smell
seems
to
be
a
little
less
character
in
the
taste
than
the
smell
just
a
grainy
addition
with
a
little
dryness
very
easy
drinking
note
scores
are
given
after
tasting
by
memory
o
i
have
been
a
fan
of
hoegaarden
a
long
time
its
nothing
too
crazy
but
is
absolutely
delicious
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
if
someone
asked
what
my
goto
summer
beer
was
id
probably
tell
them
hoegaarden
its
not
the
best
witbier
but
its
simple
kinda
cheap
and
readily
available
when
i
first
tried
this
a
few
years
ago
it
really
blew
me
away
but
these
days
not
so
much
not
sure
if
its
me
or
the
brew
that
has
changed
its
not
as
flavorful
as
i
expected
its
pretty
good
beer
highly
drinkable
very
refreshing
and
its
a
nice
warm
weather
beer
quite
a
nice
witbier
with
good
flavors
and
character
overall
unique
and
refreshing
i
could
really
get
into
a
couple
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
night
decent
beer
decent
drinkability
im
personally
undecided
on
how
much
i
like
the
spices
but
far
from
an
unpleasant
beer
rather
good
in
fact
the
smell
was
the
nicest
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
and
even
that
didnt
jump
out
at
me
the
appearance
of
this
beer
is
bar
none
it
is
the
typical
cloudy
wheat
yellow
beer
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
great
with
orange
peel
and
corriander
stereortypical
of
most
other
wheat
beers
this
beer
usually
comes
with
the
perfect
mount
of
head
if
pouring
this
from
a
bottle
use
the
instructions
found
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
stating
how
to
pour
the
last
18
of
the
bottle
into
your
glass
after
rolling
it
on
its
side
the
mouthfeel
is
descent
incredible
drinkability
in
rome
my
friends
and
i
used
to
have
a
bar
in
campo
de
fiori
that
we
called
the
hoegarrden
bar
as
it
would
serve
incredibly
sized
drafts
of
this
delicious
nector
for
only
five
euros
this
was
a
steal
at
the
time
in
2005
as
most
other
drafts
including
american
imports
were
at
least
5
euros
as
well
drinkability
pretty
satisfying
seems
like
a
good
summer
afternoon
beer
to
me
poured
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
an
average
sized
white
fizzy
head
that
was
mostly
diminishing
and
had
good
lacing
the
aroma
was
heavy
with
a
leathery
yeast
scent
light
flowery
hops
with
notes
of
orange
and
allspice
it
tasted
quite
yeasty
with
a
mild
acidic
flavor
at
first
and
finished
about
the
same
except
for
the
hints
of
orange
on
the
tongue
left
to
linger
for
a
nice
while
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
in
body
and
was
suprisingly
very
creamy
in
texture
overall
a
very
tasty
wheat
beer
definitley
worth
drinking
a
few
good
belgian
beer
i
know
its
widely
available
and
that
might
make
it
seem
to
mainstream
for
many
bas
but
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
lacks
a
lot
of
bite
this
was
one
of
my
first
experiences
with
foreignmade
witbier
many
years
ago
it
was
good
for
the
time
i
had
it
until
i
came
across
beers
from
other
craft
brewers
with
that
being
said
i
still
would
not
turn
down
this
beer
if
it
was
offered
to
me
and
i
would
definitely
have
another
this
poured
a
cloudy
white
with
nice
bubbly
foamy
head
the
smells
is
mild
yeast
maybe
some
sweet
banana
like
presence
the
taste
is
sweet
with
mild
banana
coriander
and
wheat
the
body
is
very
smooth
making
this
very
easy
drinking
this
is
a
pleasant
change
from
the
usual
ipa
i
could
have
another
overall
pleasant
summery
drink
one
of
the
first
true
imports
i
ever
had
there
is
a
good
beer
trying
to
get
out
this
is
an
average
beer
a
nice
pleasing
and
refreshing
drink
but
with
not
much
to
say
d
this
beer
is
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
the
abv
is
low
which
helps
add
to
the
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
which
helps
invite
you
back
into
the
pint
d
well
i
felt
alright
with
this
one
if
anyone
offer
me
this
as
a
drink
overall
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
light
meal
ive
had
a
lot
of
wit
beers
lately
and
its
interesting
how
none
of
them
are
much
like
this
the
original
a
very
interesting
brew
with
big
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
appearance
is
a
very
light
straw
and
cloudy
almost
looks
like
a
glass
of
lemonade
pours
with
a
thick
and
very
purewhite
head
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
while
drinking
ill
give
it
an
extra
halfpoint
on
appearance
for
the
unique
shape
of
the
bottle
and
classy
label
tastes
of
orange
lemon
and
coriander
are
present
but
subtle
with
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
at
the
end
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
hoegaarden
is
in
my
opinion
the
number
1
go
to
beer
to
persuade
people
to
start
trying
different
beer
its
foreign
tasty
nice
to
look
at
and
readily
available
with
its
all
season
taste
and
look
sexy
lookin
bottle
and
funny
name
this
has
become
a
favorite
of
mine
and
a
beer
ill
be
drinking
till
the
day
i
die
had
this
one
for
the
first
time
at
a
friends
house
yesterday
poured
a
hazy
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
generous
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
lemon
zest
fresh
citrus
and
bread
dough
crisp
light
bodied
and
refreshing
with
more
citrus
and
bread
dough
on
the
palate
drink
this
was
a
really
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
ideal
for
the
summer
months
it
is
very
clean
and
crisp
and
would
make
an
ideal
session
beer
d
this
is
a
refreshing
beverage
with
a
little
more
character
than
your
typical
lightbodied
beer
overall
this
was
a
nice
light
beer
i
was
definitely
not
expecting
this
beer
to
be
that
great
and
i
have
to
say
that
im
impressed
ill
be
buying
this
one
again
d
drinkability
is
where
this
beer
really
shines
its
a
great
starter
beer
for
people
who
are
used
to
drinking
american
adjuncts
it
offers
complexity
without
being
overwhelming
to
unexperienced
drinkers
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
its
roundedness
the
pour
revealed
a
simplistic
looking
brew
with
a
straightforward
aroma
and
a
light
and
crisp
taste
while
it
is
not
exemplary
for
the
style
this
brew
served
its
purpose
and
quenched
our
thirst
a
good
witbier
that
would
be
best
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
goes
down
easily
and
has
an
agreeable
aftertaste
i
will
definately
have
this
beer
again
the
best
place
to
experience
a
hoegaarden
is
on
the
grandplace
in
brussels
served
in
the
hoegaarden
glass
of
course
as
is
the
custom
in
belgian
bars
one
look
at
this
unique
fluid
and
you
will
understand
why
it
is
called
a
white
beer
hoegaarden
has
a
unique
head
and
translucent
whiteness
to
its
coloration
the
flavor
is
another
worldly
experience
as
well
very
light
smooth
and
refreshing
be
warned
it
is
less
like
beer
than
a
drink
all
its
own
a
must
try
beverage
drinkability
actually
had
a
hard
time
drinking
it
this
is
one
i
would
like
to
try
again
while
outdoor
in
the
dead
heat
of
summer
everything
about
it
screamed
light
and
highly
drinkable
but
not
appropriate
with
spicy
food
overall
im
not
a
big
fan
of
belgian
whites
i
mistakenly
bought
a
single
of
this
to
sample
in
haste
without
reading
the
style
i
thought
i
grabbed
a
belgian
pale
ale
if
you
like
easy
to
drink
belgian
whites
im
sure
youll
enjoy
this
one
just
ok
for
me
though
not
being
a
big
fan
of
this
style
drinkability
goes
down
very
easy
like
a
good
witbier
should
would
be
good
on
a
steamy
summer
afternoon
d
very
drinkable
as
all
wheat
beers
should
aim
to
be
a
perfect
session
beer
for
the
summer
perfect
abv
and
great
flavour
yeah
hoogaarden
is
verrry
drinkable
excellent
taste
and
balanced
nicely
in
spite
of
the
zealous
infection
of
coriander
there
are
better
few
more
solid
allaround
d
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
my
favorites
to
drink
casually
this
is
a
solid
beer
that
you
can
find
just
about
anywhere
in
bottles
there
are
some
wits
i
like
more
but
this
is
nice
def
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
summers
day
long
awesome
session
beer
probably
my
favorite
a
classic
m
d
looking
for
drinkability
this
is
the
exemplar
of
drinkability
dont
start
on
these
if
you
are
too
thirsty
or
one
may
be
likely
to
overindulge
quite
easily
hoegaarden
offers
wonderful
flavors
and
aromas
for
its
weight
making
for
the
perfect
warm
weather
beer
it
is
a
lightweight
champ
in
that
regard
but
that
description
sounds
masculine
and
this
beer
really
has
a
sweet
beautiful
feminine
personality
note
from
the
can
this
seemed
somewhat
flatter
and
weaker
in
taste
than
the
hoegaarden
id
had
on
tap
before
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
love
this
beer
always
have
it
for
my
wife
or
fatherinlaw
decided
to
review
it
easy
to
find
but
like
franziskaner
better
overall
a
really
nice
beer
goes
down
very
smooth
and
refreshing
like
a
nice
summer
afternoon
definitely
would
recommend
this
and
will
pick
it
up
again
sometime
as
a
reformed
beerhater
a
result
of
realizing
theres
more
than
the
mainstream
gagworthy
carbonatedpee
out
there
this
is
only
the
second
lager
ive
ever
reviewed
probably
a
good
reference
point
for
me
in
venturing
past
my
safe
zone
of
dark
craft
beers
while
there
were
no
dominant
flavours
of
citrus
and
or
coriander
this
subtle
refreshing
yet
creamy
beer
is
the
smoothest
and
most
drinkable
of
its
type
that
i
know
of
perfectly
balanced
not
even
a
hint
of
sourness
as
many
other
whitepalewheat
ales
go
the
aroma
was
colognegrade
pretty
of
subtle
citrus
with
no
metallic
or
glassy
smell
cute
innocuouslooking
label
perfectly
reflects
the
contents
surprisingly
filling
a
musttry
dwhat
a
nice
summertime
beer
this
makes
lightlemony
refreshing
and
low
abv
make
this
one
of
the
better
wheat
ales
verdict
one
of
the
most
interesting
things
about
this
beer
is
the
spice
kick
on
the
end
which
grows
in
intensity
further
into
the
drink
with
big
sips
and
as
the
beer
warms
i
guess
this
must
be
the
coriander
which
is
really
interesting
and
enjoyable
its
almost
like
a
holiday
spice
this
beer
should
sit
well
with
a
large
portion
of
the
drinkers
crowd
old
and
new
to
the
game
its
a
lighter
bodied
drink
than
the
average
beer
but
the
flavor
is
wonderful
and
full
of
surprises
you
wont
regret
the
purchase
a
4
05
being
a
homebrewer
you
see
a
lot
of
spices
in
beer
and
acquire
a
smell
for
fermenting
yeast
and
sediment
this
beer
is
great
think
blue
moon
without
the
citrus
this
leaves
so
many
mealparing
possibilities
as
one
fella
said
salty
foods
would
be
amazing
with
this
eyecatching
color
with
a
great
carbonated
mouthfeel
will
want
you
begging
for
more
no
wonder
why
inbev
bought
itsuch
a
shame
a
belgium
standard
the
appearance
is
just
what
i
look
for
in
a
witbier
nice
and
unfiltered
very
light
straw
color
with
a
decent
head
on
it
the
scent
is
very
citrus
with
lots
of
wheat
you
taste
the
yeast
citrus
and
spices
very
well
i
think
this
is
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
beer
it
is
a
go
to
beer
for
me
inexpensive
with
a
lot
of
flavor
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
good
brew
kind
of
filling
but
always
a
good
choice
better
out
of
tap
than
the
bottle
imo
i
could
have
another
but
id
probably
want
something
better
this
is
a
good
introductory
beer
for
this
style
i
think
would
be
good
with
some
salted
pistachios
hoegaarden
witbier
was
a
cloudy
yellowwhite
color
it
had
a
fluffy
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
was
wheat
yeast
aromas
and
spices
the
taste
was
wheat
citrus
fruits
and
spice
with
a
nice
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
this
is
a
nice
witbier
and
worth
trying
a
good
beer
to
have
with
a
friend
who
isnt
a
fan
of
strong
tasting
beer
or
to
share
with
ladyfriend
it
seems
to
be
from
my
own
experience
that
beer
female
beer
drinkers
all
have
good
things
to
say
about
this
beer
in
general
d
full
of
flavor
yet
still
light
and
refreshing
combine
that
with
a
modest
abv
and
you
get
exceptional
drinkability
this
beer
is
great
year
around
overall
a
very
enjoyable
and
refreshing
beer
this
beer
could
become
an
old
standby
its
easy
drinkability
and
great
taste
are
superb
lots
of
citrus
and
hops
but
not
too
tangy
or
sweet
and
talk
about
head
its
one
of
the
best
heads
around
if
you
want
a
white
beer
thats
really
smooth
this
one
is
probably
for
you
o
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
d
outstanding
sessional
beer
looking
for
solid
summer
beer
look
no
further
and
also
fine
for
getting
new
beer
lovers
to
try
something
not
bmc
d
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
like
some
other
reviewers
this
was
my
first
good
beer
and
lead
me
into
a
quest
for
better
beers
still
one
of
my
favorites
overall
a
very
good
beer
especially
for
one
where
you
want
something
toward
the
clarity
of
a
nice
glass
of
water
pours
hazy
straw
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
aroma
of
orange
fruit
bready
yeast
with
hints
of
spices
light
smooth
sweet
body
flavor
of
yeast
sweet
malt
fruit
and
some
spices
finish
is
medium
sweet
in
the
beginning
finally
becomes
dry
just
not
my
type
of
beverage
appearance
is
cloudy
pale
yellowtan
nice
thich
pure
white
head
about
2
fingers
tall
smells
scrumptious
with
yeast
and
breads
tastes
refreshing
and
fantastic
i
cant
get
over
the
color
of
this
beer
and
the
pure
white
conistent
froth
at
the
top
it
just
doesnt
go
away
fruity
citrus
sweet
undertone
taste
beautiful
well
rounded
wietbier
i
can
drink
these
all
day
long
d
a
fantastic
beer
overall
one
of
the
nicest
i
think
i
have
ever
tasted
its
worth
noting
that
ive
had
both
better
hoegaardens
and
worse
ones
both
straight
out
of
belgium
as
well
whats
up
with
that
i
bought
it
a
fortnight
ago
in
the
netherlands
but
its
still
amazing
i
havent
kept
it
in
the
fridge
i
recommend
it
to
everyone
who
wants
to
enjoy
a
great
witbier
perhaps
its
worth
trying
it
with
a
slice
of
orange
as
well
this
brew
is
very
easy
to
drink
easily
a
session
for
beer
for
those
who
like
wheat
beers
it
goes
down
smooth
and
creamy
again
i
have
had
better
witbiers
but
this
is
always
a
solid
brew
to
have
when
available
this
is
a
tasty
brew
for
sure
and
at
4
9
abv
the
alcohol
is
fairly
in
check
personally
the
coriander
is
a
bit
overbearing
for
me
to
want
to
put
more
than
a
couple
of
these
back
in
a
sitting
however
these
are
quite
refreshing
and
full
flavored
and
worth
treating
yourself
to
from
time
to
time
d
very
drinkable
first
had
this
beer
five
years
ago
this
is
the
beer
that
made
me
discover
better
beer
it
was
so
different
than
any
else
id
drank
at
that
time
its
among
my
favourite
wheat
beers
today
easy
drinking
though
it
would
probably
be
better
on
a
summer
day
rather
than
looking
out
at
bare
trees
with
threatening
clouds
overhead
yes
good
beer
one
of
my
favourite
beer
here
in
singapore
and
i
guess
you
can
find
it
everywhere
in
the
world
since
inbev
bought
the
company
years
ago
best
wheat
beer
even
better
than
erdinger
in
my
opinion
this
is
an
ok
beer
but
personally
i
find
it
a
bit
dull
pours
a
very
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
2finger
white
head
that
had
decent
retention
the
head
fell
down
to
a
nice
little
ring
at
the
top
of
the
beer
and
left
no
lacing
smelled
spicy
and
of
citrus
oranges
and
wheat
tastes
of
spicy
notes
from
the
yeast
citrus
orange
zest
wheat
and
a
little
hop
presence
mouthfeel
is
good
good
carbonation
a
lightmedium
body
and
goes
down
smooth
sort
of
feels
bubbly
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
goes
down
very
easy
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
good
thing
i
have
a
few
more
cheers
extremely
drinkable
overall
a
solid
beer
and
a
pleasure
to
drink
no
bold
flavors
here
subtle
balanced
and
very
refreshing
poured
this
pale
yellow
cloudy
and
very
active
beer
in
my
glass
and
it
produced
the
biggest
head
of
any
beer
in
my
recollection
the
head
was
better
than
three
fingers
of
a
very
rich
foam
i
has
taken
about
five
minutes
and
there
is
still
head
the
beer
color
is
a
3
on
the
srm
chart
smells
like
lemon
wheat
and
yeast
tastes
more
like
potatoes
with
garlic
lemon
pepper
and
wet
wheat
about
a
mouthful
of
mouthfeel
heavy
body
almost
can
chew
it
very
different
flavor
it
grows
on
your
taste
buds
will
have
to
keep
a
look
out
for
this
on
the
beer
menu
d
a
nice
drink
for
the
hot
days
subtle
flavors
it
is
not
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
but
it
is
supposedly
the
original
belgian
witbier
how
can
you
not
like
the
original
da
good
but
not
great
wheat
beer
glad
to
have
tried
but
not
something
i
will
purchase
in
future
flavor
improves
as
well
yet
seems
somewhat
artificial
more
orange
than
lemon
slightly
sweet
and
viscous
for
the
style
a
good
carbonation
supports
the
feel
reasonably
well
a
bit
of
a
spin
brings
back
a
cap
of
foam
and
a
myriad
of
smells
finish
is
short
with
a
bit
of
lemon
bread
decent
drinkability
though
nothing
special
and
the
spices
seem
a
bit
overdone
these
delicate
beers
seem
best
from
the
bottle
indeed
d
the
flavors
in
this
beer
are
not
such
that
id
want
to
drink
multiples
at
a
time
the
spices
and
citrus
are
strong
and
a
little
overbearing
on
the
palate
but
im
sure
this
would
be
a
great
by
the
pool
refreshment
on
a
hot
summer
day
easy
drinking
wheat
ale
that
would
go
down
well
on
any
warm
summer
day
pours
a
very
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
brings
forward
some
citrus
and
a
bit
of
wheat
the
taste
is
orange
citrus
slight
spice
wheat
and
a
bit
of
grain
definitely
a
fairly
light
mouthfeel
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
drinks
fairly
well
although
not
super
flavorful
pours
a
very
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
white
head
and
superb
lacing
smells
of
coriander
oranges
grapefruit
pepper
and
wheat
tastes
of
coriander
orange
peel
pepper
wheat
malts
and
tasty
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
nice
carbonation
drinkability
is
very
good
the
beer
is
an
excellent
selection
d
another
one
of
those
really
well
known
beers
that
everybody
sort
of
has
to
try
somewhere
along
the
way
i
havent
had
this
beer
for
a
long
time
but
i
did
not
find
it
did
much
for
me
on
this
occasion
drinkability
is
great
until
you
finish
your
first
two
pints
after
that
you
need
a
nap
definitley
needs
an
orange
slice
very
cheap
only
eight
for
a
sixer
and
twice
that
for
a
twelve
add
an
orange
and
throw
one
to
your
old
lady
because
its
that
easy
to
like
sláinte
dwas
a
true
enjoyment
very
recommended
would
love
to
try
on
tap
drinkability
i
have
a
hard
time
putting
this
down
for
some
reason
there
might
be
just
a
bit
too
much
coriander
to
make
this
very
drinkable
it
hits
all
the
right
tickmarks

notes
ive
given
this
beer
so
many
chances
and
really
want
to
like
it
but
it
just
isnt
that
good
it
is
very
watery
and
has
no
real
backbone
to
it
the
malt
character
is
completely
overpowered
by
the
yeast
leaving
it
very
empty
tasting
cheers
goes
down
way
easy
but
not
in
a
good
way
d
easy
to
drink
flavours
are
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
mix
of
sweet
and
tart
decent
beer
with
a
distinct
taste
appears
banana
yellow
in
color
with
a
two
finger
head
smells
of
spice
and
clove
taste
is
unique
with
clove
and
spice
crisp
and
easy
on
the
palate
not
the
best
of
its
kind
but
a
good
showing
would
drink
as
a
session
or
with
a
meal
hoegaarden
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
wth
a
large
head
strong
wheat
smell
with
a
strong
spicey
note
the
taste
was
very
traditional
of
this
style
a
bit
stronger
wheat
taste
weaker
spicey
a
blue
moon
with
flavor
very
easy
to
drink
not
the
stongest
flavors
overall
pretty
good
not
the
best
very
refresing
for
an
unusally
very
hot
autumn
day
pours
a
completely
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
scent
is
extremely
bold
with
tons
of
spices
clove
and
banana
this
beer
is
so
unique
the
perfect
white
beer
scent
is
just
so
lovely
it
makes
you
wonder
why
beers
like
blue
moon
and
shock
top
even
exist
the
taste
is
so
well
balanced
this
beer
is
a
perfect
session
beer
great
fruitiness
along
with
sweet
spices
as
well
as
nice
yeasty
notes
that
just
make
this
beer
an
amazing
brew
mouthfeel
is
great
and
drinkability
is
incredible
ps
whole
foods
caries
cases
d
at
first
this
comes
across
as
a
potent
flavored
brew
and
might
be
hard
to
want
a
bunch
but
after
getting
about
halfway
through
my
sampling
here
it
gets
much
mellower
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
it
is
refreshing
and
would
really
cut
through
a
spicy
asian
dish
well
on
its
own
this
makes
a
really
nice
hot
weather
brew
drinkability
definatly
a
drinkable
beer
tasty
but
not
so
good
that
it
would
be
a
disservice
to
the
beer
to
drink
in
quantity
and
lose
flavor
drinkability
is
ok
on
the
side
of
wheat
beers
where
i
dont
really
like
to
have
more
than
one
overall
well
done
just
not
my
beer
pours
out
a
hazy
lemonlimeade
clean
white
head
tops
this
bier
and
settles
to
a
thin
creamy
lace
light
and
refreshing
wheat
and
light
corriander
with
slightest
hind
of
citrus
a
very
nice
faint
tart
at
the
finish
is
wonderful
very
drinkablesessionsable
overall
a
great
and
authentic
representation
of
a
belgian
white
not
as
good
as
st
bernardus
but
damn
better
than
most
american
whites
i
have
had
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
and
it
isnt
very
pleasant
to
drink
good
to
try
once
but
i
wont
be
coming
back
dcan
drink
this
stuff
for
hours
on
end
ive
probably
consumed
about
150
bottlesglasses
of
this
over
the
past
56
years
one
of
my
favorite
beer
experiences
ever
was
pounding
like
two
cold
bottles
of
this
after
playing
tennis
for
two
hours
with
no
water
spices
yeast
fresh
wheat
balanced
very
nicely
here
awesome
hot
weather
beer
fantastic
for
what
it
is
and
what
its
supposed
to
be
really
nice
beer
but
nothing
for
everyday
drinking
drinkability
due
to
the
taste
of
this
and
its
low
abv
i
could
drink
these
all
night
very
light
in
color
beer
taste
is
exceptional
hints
of
citrus
and
if
poured
correctly
has
a
very
white
light
foamy
head
wonderful
beer
on
hot
day
as
it
is
not
a
heavy
beer
but
is
heavy
on
flavor
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
beers
am
looking
forward
to
trying
this
on
tap
at
the
alehouse
here
in
new
braunfels
wonderful
beer
great
beer
belgium
knows
how
to
do
it
right
o
classic
belgium
witbier
the
spicy
and
citrus
smell
and
palate
makes
it
a
delicious
and
refreshing
option
for
hot
summer
days
delicate
aroma
flavorful
taste
with
a
hint
of
coriander
and
orange
one
of
the
few
beers
i
enjoy
icecold
i
once
found
a
recipe
online
to
make
hoegaarden
icecream
so
i
did
if
youre
a
fan
of
this
beer
i
strongly
suggest
you
try
making
it
youll
always
find
a
six
pack
of
hoegaarden
in
my
fridge
my
all
time
favorite
beer
i
never
get
tired
of
enjoying
a
cold
pint
at
my
favorite
spot
the
color
taste
and
smell
are
excellent
the
subtle
hint
of
orange
and
the
floral
noes
really
match
perfectly
i
enjoy
this
beer
so
much
i
can
tell
when
the
keg
is
almost
empty
or
fresh
overall
i
didnt
like
this
beer
very
much
i
had
higher
expectations
for
it
than
what
it
turned
out
to
be
probably
wouldnt
go
for
another
d
i
cant
argue
with
the
name
orginal
white
ale
this
has
all
the
components
of
a
great
witbier
even
if
it
is
lacking
that
special
something
its
extremely
refreshing
and
a
great
choice
for
craft
beer
beginners
overall
very
nice
beer
for
a
hot
summer
afternoon
very
fruity
in
flavor
that
goes
down
very
smooth
and
allow
multiples
intakes
the
go
to
beer
of
my
wife
a
little
watery
for
my
taste
will
have
again
with
no
problem
d
meh
not
great
but
not
extremely
off
putting
one
of
the
better
option
at
the
bar
though
a
good
example
of
a
witbier
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
d
easy
to
drink
lots
of
these
period
cheers
rjt
d
this
is
such
a
delicious
and
pleasant
beer
if
simple
highly
drinkable
one
of
my
goto
favorites
in
the
wit
style
session
beer
for
sure
served
from
bottle
into
lindemans
pilsner
pours
an
opaque
pale
pale
yellow
with
a
three
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsides
to
none
quickly
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
present
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
fruit
citrus
wheat
and
grains
the
flavor
was
of
wheat
bananas
malt
and
grain
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
it
goes
down
very
smooth
this
might
have
been
due
to
the
lackluster
intensity
of
the
flavors
and
aroma
present
i
have
had
this
brew
quite
awhile
back
when
i
first
started
into
craft
beer
and
have
just
now
gotten
a
chance
to
have
it
again
for
a
review
this
is
a
good
starter
beer
for
people
just
getting
into
craft
brew
but
not
overly
good
for
its
style
just
needs
a
little
more
oomph
drinkability
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
i
had
this
before
during
a
baseball
game
and
thought
it
was
pretty
good
in
the
bottle
in
the
glass
its
still
very
drinkable
and
it
quenches
the
thirst
very
well
went
well
with
a
meal
then
burger
and
now
asiago
and
orzo
chicken
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
another
one
despite
the
weakness
of
the
flavor
its
still
very
refreshing
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
just
not
my
favorite
the
beer
is
a
slightly
cloudy
and
very
light
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
lemony
along
with
some
wheat
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
and
spice
flavors
of
lemon
and
wheat
dominate
the
taste
but
the
flavors
arent
over
powering
theres
some
clove
spice
mixed
in
and
a
faint
bit
of
hops
in
the
background
aftertaste
is
mildly
bready
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
crisp
and
very
smooth
lighttomedium
body
mediumtoheavy
carbonation
finish
is
clean
d
very
drinkable
very
refreshing
an
excellent
session
beer
taste
is
interesting
very
nice
fruit
clove
combo
a
little
on
the
watery
side
i
would
like
the
full
promise
of
the
flavor
to
be
realized
in
the
body
but
nice
overall
it
starts
out
big
but
finishes
rather
thin
i
guess
that
makes
it
highly
drinkable
in
fact
it
is
very
refreshing
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
and
could
see
myself
having
a
few
of
these
there
are
better
witbiers
out
there
but
this
is
a
nice
basis
drinkability
never
again
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
clovey
witbiers
i
am
sure
you
can
find
a
better
choice
though
i
admit
that
it
takes
a
really
superb
one
to
win
me
over
as
it
is
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
the
taste
is
soursweet
like
a
lemonade
with
some
hops
and
some
spices
all
in
all
it
has
good
complex
flavours
but
it
will
never
be
one
of
my
all
time
favourite
beers
by
some
margin
looks
like
pineapple
juice
with
a
solid
two
fingers
of
perfectly
white
head
pretty
much
how
i
think
a
white
ale
should
look
musty
aroma
with
hints
of
sulfur
and
spice
somewhat
thin
in
the
body
department
the
wheaty
citrus
notes
and
a
hint
of
banana
are
better
expressed
in
the
taste
hoegaarden
is
quite
refreshing
and
with
a
quick
finish
you
are
ready
for
more
unless
you
hate
it
extremely
pale
straw
colored
beer
with
big
foamy
head
which
subsides
rapidly
leaving
some
lacing
smell
is
of
bready
yeast
some
light
pepperiness
mild
phenols
and
maybe
some
light
grapefruit
taste
is
just
average
imo
pale
malt
upfront
followed
by
yeast
and
rounded
out
by
a
spicy
finish
mouthfeel
is
just
above
average
as
well
this
beer
lack
some
of
the
body
that
its
fellow
witbiers
have
good
carbonation
combined
with
light
refreshing
taste
and
moderate
body
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
while
this
beer
certainly
isnt
bad
i
wont
be
getting
it
again
bought
this
at
a
czech
grocery
store
for
1
50
pours
out
of
a
33cl
bottle
a
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
leaving
little
lacing
the
nose
is
strong
lemon
and
bubble
gum
the
taste
is
similar
refreshing
and
tasty
not
a
bad
wheat
beer
poured
an
11
2
bottle
into
a
chimay
glass
my
usual
decent
head
and
good
appearance
somewhat
cloudy
light
golden
color
a
pleasant
tasting
belgian
beer
for
not
much
more
than
a
good
american
beer
plenty
of
value
i
consider
this
one
of
my
staple
beers
this
beer
is
a
leader
in
this
style
its
unmatched
in
balance
and
spice
dont
pass
this
beer
up
ive
had
this
beer
in
europe
not
belgium
and
its
just
as
good
as
i
tasted
it
it
in
america
i
drank
alot
of
hoegaarden
in
europe
the
beer
that
i
did
this
review
with
is
from
a
oklahoma
liquor
store
its
just
as
good
as
the
beer
i
had
in
europe
a
nice
simple
witbier
not
hugely
complex
but
tasty
and
refreshing
a
very
nice
summer
beer
good
white
ale
actually
one
of
my
standbys
this
beer
is
great
with
food
especially
rich
food
i
love
it
with
strong
german
and
french
cheese
knocks
your
socks
off
it
is
light
in
color
and
really
taste
as
well
it
is
a
good
beer
to
keep
cold
and
ready
to
go
citrus
flavor
and
good
body
serving
type
bottle
even
though
this
brew
is
distributed
from
inbev
its
hard
to
turn
your
back
on
it
hoegaarden
wietbier
has
a
calm
appearance
with
a
very
pale
yellow
tone
it
pours
nicely
and
then
head
is
thick
the
aroma
is
a
subtle
orange
on
the
palette
the
bouquet
opens
up
and
a
nice
combination
of
spice
and
orange
is
revealed
the
texture
overall
is
smooth
and
light
this
wietbier
is
quite
drinkable
especially
during
the
summer
if
you
like
this
style
beer
and
come
across
this
beer
on
tap
do
give
it
a
try
edit
after
some
more
research
for
the
stylewitbier
definitley
above

hoegaarden
is

this

the

i

if

just
try
one
this
one
would
be
a
good
one
to

this
is
one
id

with
a

very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
an
easydrinking

and
a
nice
goto

at
bars
serving
large

easy

simply
one
of
the
very
best
in

tops
in

category
tried
on

from

citrus
and
light

with

very

and
excellent
session
beer
blue
moon
cannot
hold
a
candle
to
this
worldclass
brew
cheers
to
the
belgians
once
again
overall
this
is
a
fairly
easy
beer
to
drink
ive
rarely
had
a
problem
ordering
one
when
im
looking
for
something
lighter
to
drink
and
it
goes
well
with
a
fairly
good
amount
of
grub
d
with
an
abv
of
5
this
is
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
summer
d
arguably
the
quintessential
wit
really
easy
to
knock
back
several
in
a
session
especially
in
summertime
the
mouthfeel
is
more
of
a
smooth
than
a
crisp
though
it
is
that
to
a
point
the
carbonation
is
active
and
body
is
moderate
the
rich
frothy
collar
rests
atop
the
yellowish
cloudy
brew
and
suggests
a
white
aurora
towards
the
bottom
of
the
pint
glass
aromas
are
reminiscent
of
orange
creamsicle
coriander
and
some
faint
big
league
chew
original
bubblegum
in
the
back
citrus
lemon
and
orange
flavors
mix
pale
wheat
and
clean
hop
tinge
create
a
wonderful
and
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
a
wedding
or
a
day
in
the
backyard
with
friends
had
on
tap
with
some
frenchfries
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
no
head
lots
of
lacing
smells
nice
a
lot
of
yeasty
esters
and
citrus
definitely
some
coriander
tastes
like
it
smells
the
yeast
shines
thru
and
theres
a
lot
of
character
from
the
wheat
malt
the
high
carbonation
makes
it
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
hoegaarden
is
also
a
very
light
beer
its
not
very
filling
so
it
doesnt
take
much
to
knock
a
couple
back
unless
youve
got
some
food
around
even
though
i
havent
got
one
of
the
hoegaarden
glass
i
must
say
that
its
key
to
have
some
sort
of
glass
otherwise
the
sediment
makes
the
last
sip
gross
of
course
i
know
someone
who
enjoys
the
taste
but
it
makes
me
cringe
every
time
i
forget
about
it
and
drink
a
bottle
without
thinking
d
similar
to
a
german
hefe
except
hoegaarden
is
not
as
heavy
this
beers
low
abv
and
smoothness
make
it
a
wonderful
summertime
refresher
very
easy
to
slam
the
taste
is
also
good
dry
but
not
overly
dry
a
bit
fruity
or
perfumy
without
being
overly
so
very
light
citrus
or
banana
qualities
with
a
hint
of
7up
the
feel
is
a
bit
zesty
and
tingly
its
crisp
as
well
mfd
light
and
refreshing
a
nice
warm
weather
choice
overall
a
well
balanced
beer
very
drinkable
perfect
to
cool
off
but
lacks
body
and
intensity
however
i
suppose
this
is
typical
of
the
style
certainly
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
but
only
if
the
weather
called
for
it
flavor
is
citrus
zest
crisp
wheat
body
and
a
spicy
somewhat
bitter
and
balancing
coriander
on
the
finish
yeast
is
somewhat
understated
for
the
style
and
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
watery
at
times
refreshing
and
light
good
beer
far
from
the
first
time
ive
had
this
but
it
deserves
a
raveup
still
one
of
the
best
wits
going
round
the
balance
is
what
i
find
other
makers
cant
quite
seem
to
match
the
light
fruity
esters
and
that
spicy
nose
dont
luck
out
and
fall
away
on
the
palate
like
many
imitators
all
componenets
working
together
to
make
a
smooth
very
drinkable
beer
with
plenty
of
flavour
and
loads
of
character
yum
drinks
pretty
easy
a
little
more
drinkable
on
draft
a
little
more
gassy
so
some
complexity
is
lost
a
benchmark
for
the
style
when
freshnot
stale
there
are
ones
i
like
better
but
would
always
recommend
this
one
as
your
first
wit
overall
a
good
beer
and
one
that
can
easily
be
enjoyed
especially
on
a
warm
day
easy
drinkability
the
first
few
swallows
were
not
only
refreshing
but
filled
with
more
of
the
lemonpeppery
goodness
the
warmer
the
beer
for
the
sweeter
the
taste
was
overall
pretty
well
rounded
brew
an
excellent
thirst
quencher
i
suspect
i
could
session
these
quite
easily
d
a
great
beer
to
have
when
your
having
more
than
one
a
great
specimen
of
the
style
despite
its
mass
production
overall
an
average
brew
a
little
too
much
on
the
lemon
side
for
me
rr
d
probably
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
generally
enjoyable
anytime
but
especially
in
the
spring
and
summer
beer
is
a
yellow
light
amber
color
its
cloudy
with
white
head
good
retention
smell
is
nice
and
simple
of
spices
citrus
cloves
and
hint
of
banana
taste
is
nice
and
mild
perhaps
just
a
little
to
watery
for
me
nice
banana
citrus
taste
nothing
overpowering
nice
and
simple
very
mild
carbonation
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
while
this
beer
is
refreshing
when
it
is
refrigerator
cold
the
subtle
nuances
of
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
are
not
as
appreciated
as
when
it
warms
to
about
50
degrees
a
pretty
tame
wit
that
appeals
to
a
broad
audience
but
there
is
little
doubt
this
is
a
finely
crafted
brew
initially
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
like
a
blue
moon
so
i
drank
it
like
one
i
then
came
back
and
took
it
for
what
it
was
worthwhich
is
an
entity
unto
itself
and
i
absolutely
loved
it
drinkability
its
really
good
there
little
body
or
overwhelming
complexity
to
this
beer
it
went
went
well
with
my
chicken
caesar
salad
very
sessionable
d
easy
to
drink
and
light
alcohol
makes
this
a
go
to
in
the
springsummer
time
this
actually
goes
down
like
water
because
of
the
feel
and
non
offensiveness
d
great
light
crisp
summer
beer
definitely
want
this
white
ale
again
and
at
its
price
point
its
a
very
affordable
brew
definitely
going
to
try
to
always
keep
a
few
of
these
stashed
away
in
the
fridge
had
on
tap
at
charlie
browns
steakhouse
served
in
a
pint
glass
a
crayola
orangeyellow
color
with
a
halffinger
of
foamy
white
head
which
left
sparse
lacing
aroma
was
banana
orange
cloves
and
lemon
mouthfeel
was
much
thinner
than
i
thought
it
would
be
with
little
carbonation
taste
was
like
the
nose
adding
some
along
with
hard
sugar
candy
sweetness
drinkability
is
low
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
which
i
did
not
particularly
enjoy
i
feel
it
does
not
exemplify
the
style
there
was
no
crispness
as
there
is
in
other
wits
i
have
tried
just
a
syrupy
candy
sweetness
maybe
it
has
something
to
do
with
it
being
on
tap
i
would
only
ever
try
this
again
from
a
bottle
in
order
to
give
it
a
fair
shot
pours
a
murky
very
pale
whitish
yellow
nice
sized
fizzy
head
dissipates
quickly
aroma
is
wheaty
banana
cloves
lemons
and
some
yeasty
earthiness
taste
has
just
a
bit
of
underlying
sweetness
wheat
tang
with
similar
notes
as
in
the
aroma
well
carbonated
and
crisp
mouthfeel
maybe
a
little
watery
quite
drinkable
a
nice
summer
beer
all
in
all
an
acceptable
wit
that
would
be
easy
to
session
d
good
summertime
beer
i
could
def
drink
this
while
grilling
some
lemon
herb
shrimp
mmm
d
i
could
drink
these
great
things
all
day
long
no
better
beer
for
warm
weather
this
mild
fairly
watered
down
witbier
makes
it
perfect
for
a
large
target
audience
there
was
nothing
bad
about
this
beer
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
really
jumped
out
to
distinguish
it
from
others
on
the
other
hand
its
very
refreshing
and
definately
sessionable
overall
a
decent
brew
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
if
offered
very
drinkable
no
doubt
perhaps
the
standard
in
which
witbiers
are
compared
easy
to
drink
wont
get
old
but
wont
blow
your
mind
drinkability
a
good
wheat
beer
maybe
not
for
the
price
there
are
other
better
choices
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
with
its
rather
low
abv
at
4
9
percent
a
long
time
favorite
of
mine
its
time
i
gave
it
a
review
here
pours
a
pale
hazy
yellow
with
some
decent
lace
work
on
the
glass
a
light
spicy
slightly
fruity
aroma
great
fresh
taste
of
crisp
wheat
with
a
little
citrus
and
lemon
and
nice
spicy
zip
at
the
end
its
a
light
tasting
beer
to
be
sure
but
a
lively
one
decent
level
of
carbonation
and
a
very
smooth
very
drinakble
works
well
all
by
itself
as
a
thirst
quenching
type
beer
but
also
works
for
me
with
light
spicy
foods
like
grilled
shrimp
pale
golden
cloudy
color
nice
head
and
lacing
that
stayed
around
banana
wheat
apricot
aroma
goes
down
very
smooth
and
was
very
refreshing
it
was
gone
before
i
knew
it
will
surely
have
it
again
and
will
share
with
friends
that
like
wheat
beer
overall
this
is
a
classic
and
defines
the
witbier
style
that
all
others
follow
the
flavor
is
weak
compared
to
allagash
white
but
this
beer
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
this
beer
is
better
ontap
that
in
bottle
which
i
find
to
be
extremely
inconsistent
d
easy
to
drink
although
i
think
that
the
fruit
flavor
would
get
to
me
after
several
of
them
this
is
one
of
the
best
witbiers
i
have
had
it
is
a
beer
that
always
goes
fast
when
you
have
people
over
always
the
party
pleaser
an
excellent
brew
for
what
is
becoming
a
very
commercial
beer
hopfully
it
stays
excellent
hoegaarden
is
one
of
my
top
five
favorites
cannot
stop
singing
its
praises
nice
white
head
sits
on
top
of
pale
yellow
body
that
is
cloudy
from
the
yeast
almost
no
carbonation
little
bit
of
lemon
in
the
aroma
more
tame
lemons
in
the
taste
juicey
with
a
little
bit
of
sourness
pretty
bland
compared
to
other
witbiers
this
is
a
very
good
witbier
and
is
extremely
drinkable
i
know
that
a
lot
of
people
would
disagree
with
me
but
i
dont
really
think
that
this
is
far
superior
to
blue
moon
its
certainly
better
but
it
doesnt
blow
it
out
of
the
water
i
personally
feel
that
they
are
both
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
when
i
drink
a
witbier
light
crisp
and
refreshing
exactly
what
i
want
when
i
take
a
rare
break
from
my
usual
ipas
and
dipas
drinkability
easily
a
session
beer
i
prefer
its
german
relative
hefeweizens
over
the
belgian
wheat
beer
but
still
a
good
beer
which
brings
me
to
drinkablility
this
beer
is
so
light
delicate
balanced
and
so
light
in
abv
it
is
gone
before
you
know
it
this
makes
a
great
brew
inbetween
tastings
or
perfect
on
a
summer
afternoon
i
introduce
this
one
to
buddrinking
friends
and
there
hooked
an
eyeopener
if
your
inexperienced
with
witbier
or
one
to
sit
back
with
eyes
closed
and
a
contented
sigh
if
you
are
solid
standard
worth
drinking
if
you
havent
ive
had
hoegaarden
a
few
times
and
everytime
i
have
one
i
really
struggle
to
finish
it
and
i
dont
know
anyone
that
particularly
likes
it
either
this
is
the
beer
that
when
someone
in
my
group
of
friends
brings
in
a
beer
that
turns
out
to
taste
awful
somebody
says
yeah
this
is
bad
but
do
you
remember
that
hoegaarden
maybe
im
not
the
cloudy
orange
flavored
wheat
beer
type
but
im
giving
it
two
thumbs
down
final
thought
definitely
a
popular
brew
that
deserves
a
look
great
flavor
and
easy
accesibility
means
more
people
should
give
this
a
shot
very
nice
that
being
said
this
itself
isnt
the
beer
it
used
to
be
since
being
bought
out
and
commercialized
by
giant
megaconglomerate
inbev
i
wont
take
away
from
what
interbrew
has
done
to
pry
the
witbier
style
into
mainstream
beer
culture
but
just
as
much
praise
if
not
more
is
due
to
the
man
actually
from
the
town
of
hoegaarden
the
man
originally
responsible
for
the
recipe
pierre
celis
if
you
like
this
beer
than
do
yourself
a
favour
take
the
next
step
read
up
on
and
seek
out
the
st
bernardus
pierre
celis
signature
witbier
d
not
the
best
wit
around
but
they
are
good
refreshing
anytime
of
the
year
a
nice
cloudy
straw
color
with
great
citrus
scents
i
refuse
a
lemon
with
this
its
not
needed
nice
smooth
mouthfeel
can
drink
plenty
of
these
at
a
session
this
is
what
a
wit
should
be
clean
and
smooth
to
drink
with
a
great
wheatycitrus
kick
perfect
summer
beer
final
thoughts
as
my
first
witbier
i
was
impressed
yes
the
flavor
is
a
bit
strange
but
i
enjoyed
it
up
till
the
very
end
when
i
got
a
mouthful
of
pulp
frankly
im
shocked
that
this
beer
comes
from
belgium
as
id
expect
it
to
come
from
a
tropical
location
given
the
flavor
id
get
it
again
on
tap
if
i
wanted
something
weird
or
something
fruity
to
cool
me
down
in
the
summer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
a
case
of
it
though
d
not
my
favorite
wit
but
i
do
like
this
quite
a
bit
d
figured
id
try
the
original
belgian
wit
from
1445
even
though
it
is
technically
a
macro
abinbev
decent
enough
will
most
likely
pick
up
a
6er
to
have
around
but
with
so
many
other
decent
wits
around
who
knows
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
not
incredibly
complex
but
fairly
smooth
very
refreshing
and
a
great
thirst
quencher
looks
like
this
would
be
easy
to
enjoy
a
few
of
on
a
hot
day
to
me
it
is
too
watery
the
cloves
are
the
best
part
of
the
beer
this
isnt
my
favorite
wit
but
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
good
witbier
a
benchmark
for
all
others
this
was
one
of
those
eyeopening
beers
back
in
high
school
it
was
probably
the
first
bev
that
made
me
realize
there
was
a
whole
world
of
potential
out
there
that
said
i
cant
imagine
how
i
used
to
down
sixers
of
this
d
this
is
a
real
smooth
beer
with
good
flavor
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
wish
i
had
my
hexagonal
glass
with
me
for
this
one
hoegaarden
is
a
great
witbier
and
a
must
have
for
the
witpurist
its
not
my
all
time
favorite
white
but
its
a
classic
d
quenches
thirst
and
goes
well
with
poultry
and
fish
not
too
bad
still
not
a
favorite
of
mine
comments
very
good
tasting
beer
that
is
not
too
strong
with
the
spices
and
is
very
smooth
to
drink
it
was
smooth
as
i
expected
and
was
quite
drinkable
i
might
not
have
it
again
but
i
recommend
you
try
it
d
tough
one
for
me
sometimes
i
like
it
sometimes
i
dont
if
im
in
the
mood
for
it
i
can
have
a
few
mouthfeel
is
carbonated
and
tart
clearly
very
drinkable
this
truely
is
my
favorite
white
beer
it
is
one
of
the
few
white
beers
that
i
have
had
so
far
but
it
is
the
best
its
real
good
with
guinnness
as
well
there
is
a
definite
kick
of
fruit
in
the
taste
now
i
can
distinguish
the
orange
peel
hoegaarden
gives
you
that
acidity
that
i
had
expected
with
the
citrus
flavor
this
is
a
balanced
brew
as
with
the
sweetness
of
the
fruit
i
am
also
catching
some
sourness
as
well
i
also
can
feel
the
carbonation
as
it
hits
my
mouth
it
is
a
lightbodied
beer
that
finishes
dry
with
a
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
little
too
citrusy
overly
lemony
to
the
point
that
id
tire
of
it
after
a
couple
but
a
very
nice
light
refreshing
beer
an
ok
beer
i
needed
to
wean
off
of
miller
litethose
kinds
of
beers
so
i
started
trying
out
mid
and
high
end
beers
this
one
leaves
a
kind
of
nasty
aftertaste
though
good
taste
what
a
better
beer
tastes
like
but
it
leaves
that
aftertaste
behind
that
isnt
very
attractive
maybe
its
just
me
though
i
think
i
could
ease
back
into
a
comfy
chair
and
suck
back
a
six
pack
of
the
belgians
no
problem
thanks
krista
cloudy
unfiltered
goldenyellow
appearance
with
a
bit
of
white
foam
refreshing
aromas
of
citrus
and
coriander
the
taste
is
momentary
sweetness
balanced
with
the
dark
spice
of
coriander
wheat
and
citrus
heavy
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
mask
the
spices
hoegaardens
flavor
and
refreshing
qualities
make
this
beer
so
drinkable
that
i
can
never
ever
stop
after
one
i
look
forward
to
someday
tasting
it
in
belgium
this
is
actually
a
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
by
almost
everyone
even
occasional
beer
drinkers
really
love
the
flavor
as
do
experienced
beer
drinkers
looking
for
a
smooth
wheat
beer
the
only
downside
is
that
it
is
a
bit
pricey
normally
911
for
a
six
pack
very
crisp
and
very
drinkable
review
edit
i
dont
know
what
the
problem
was
but
ever
since
this
review
i
get
monstrous
heads
on
my
hoegaardens
heres
the
kicker
the
flavour
didnt
change
after
that
first
sip
i
didnt
find
any
improvement
or
backsliding
and
even
the
head
stayed
about
the
same
i
took
about
20
minutes
to
drink
this
beer
and
throughout
the
experience
i
didnt
find
any
development
this
would
be
fine
if
hoegaarden
was
outstanding
but
i
dont
think
it
is
i
was
slightly
disappointed
i
had
hoped
it
would
develop
more
through
the
session
this
may
be
an
issue
of
white
beers
and
my
own
taste
but
i
finished
the
beer
without
being
too
impressed
i
expected
more
out
of
it
to
be
honest
i
can
only
rate
it
as
average
for
its
lack
of
outright
flaws
its
fine
if
youre
going
to
have
a
few
with
friends
who
dont
like
anything
heavier
or
more
flavourful
but
its
nothing
to
get
too
excited
over
the
price
and
availability
of
this
beer
make
it
that
much
better
pours
a
slightly
hazy
lemonwater
yellow
color
with
a
booming
pure
white
head
soft
citrusy
wheat
character
in
the
nose
soft
with
hints
of
mint
and
hop
bitterness
bright
to
the
tongue
lots
of
husky
grain
clean
wheat
and
lime
peel
doughy
yeast
and
a
fruity
twang
upon
the
finish
the
only
thing
truly
lacking
here
in
flavor
is
its
aftertaste
burnt
and
stale
musky
and
it
stays
with
you
for
what
seems
like
forever
light
in
body
crisp
enough
definitely
refreshing
ive
had
many
better
witbier
but
a
hoey
still
remains
drinkable
imo
d
a
great
representative
of
the
wit
style
i
felt
it
was
a
little
heavy
on
the
coriander
and
light
on
all
other
components
however
i
would
gladly
drink
this
beer
almost
anytime
poured
a
pale
straw
color
that
was
milky
with
a
big
impressive
head
head
dissipated
quickly
definitely
smelled
of
orange
and
wheat
tasted
similar
to
the
smell
with
a
nice
dry
finish
beer
was
nicely
balanced
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
a
nice
summer
refresher
m
d
its
crisp
but
not
overdone
dry
but
not
parching
a
decent
body
but
the
flavour
profiles
are
just
not
quite
there
this
beer
has
plenty
of
potential
to
be
something
very
great
i
hope
to
see
that
happen
the
mouthfeel
is
light
not
quite
as
like
as
water
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
high
i
could
drink
these
all
night
d
you
could
really
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
actually
several
of
these
beers
this
beer
is
easy
to
find
easy
to
drink
and
easy
on
the
liver
a
world
better
than
blue
moon
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
50
degrees
the
beer
was
very
white
and
the
beer
was
very
cloudy
the
beer
poured
a
really
fluffy
big
white
head
that
looked
delicious
the
smell
was
very
breadt
very
yeasty
and
was
favorable
however
the
taste
was
just
not
good
for
me
certainly
wheat
beers
are
not
my
favorite
but
if
you
like
a
slightly
sour
tasting
beer
you
might
like
ot
i
will
not
buy
again
drinkability
is
about
as
high
as
it
gets
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
downing
45
pints
of
hoegaarden
on
a
given
evening
this
is
one
easy
pleaser
of
a
beer
good
witbier
and
available
almost
everywhere
one
of
the
best
beers
you
can
buy
at
walmart
or
almost
any
grocery
store
a
light
and
citrusy
white
beer
with
a
hefty
amount
of
spice
mainly
apparent
in
the
after
taste
this
beer
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
came
in
a
thoughtfully
designed
bottle
and
six
pack
holder
the
bulb
at
the
neck
of
the
bottle
helped
to
ensure
a
better
pour
and
the
top
of
the
six
pack
holder
provided
the
phonetic
spelling
of
hoegaarden
to
help
with
pronunciation
the
attention
to
detail
and
thought
put
into
this
beer
is
top
notch
take
my
opinion
with
a
grain
of
salt
since
this
is
literally
my
official
third
beer
not
counting
whatever
i
had
when
i
lived
in
mexico
since
ive
been
searching
for
something
id
like
id
definitely
buy
this
again
and
i
plan
on
bringing
it
whenever
someone
asks
me
to
bring
drinks
to
a
getty
again
still
one
of
the
better
belgian
witbiers
beer
is
very
session
able
easy
to
drink
not
my
favorite
witbier
but
love
the
style
so
would
drink
again
overall
it
is
a
decent
brew
for
something
so
popular
i
could
probably
enjoy
this
at
a
bar
or
have
this
for
a
session
beer
d
good
drinkability
the
flavor
is
nothing
out
of
the
world
but
its
solid
tastes
fine
without
adding
any
oranges
which
makes
it
better
than
blue
moon
at
any
rate
still
with
all
the
other
good
wits
out
there
probably
not
something
i
would
seek
out
its
just
not
my
style
i
guess
i
really
didnt
like
it
but
others
might
i
dont
think
i
like
coriander
and
orange
peel
in
beer
in
food
sure
but
beer
no
dont
think
i
had
a
wit
beer
i
liked
yet
it
costs
too
much
to
be
an
every
day
beer
but
it
is
a
very
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
bought
it
id
buy
this
again
and
probably
will
in
the
future
i
do
plan
on
trying
it
again
however
conclusion
simple
flavors
of
citrus
and
spice
coupled
with
great
drinkability
this
would
make
one
supremely

for

and
the
312
by

this
beer
is
excellent
with
a
slice
of
orange
i
love
the
exceptional
clove
taste
and
the
fact
that
its
actually
brewed
in
belgium
very
very
easy
to
drink
but
too
much
of
the
clove
taste
starts
to
wear
thin
id
recommend
if
you
need
a
break
from
ipas
like
i
do
sometimes
slip
this
in
here
and
there
d
this
is
honestly
one
of
the
more
drinkable
beers
for
me
especially
on
tap
i
would
not
pass
this
up
anywhere
and
if
it
wasnt
for
the
price
this
would
be
my
defacto
fridge
beer
during
the
summer
overall
this
is
a
good
wheat
beer
there
are
some
sweet
and
sour
notes
while
drinking
this
beer
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
go
to
witbier
beer
could
drink
many
of
these
fast
but
itd
get
a
bit
boring
yellow
pour
with
a
massvie
white

definite
sweet
aroma
and
taste
with
the
orange
peel
and
coriander
strong
up
front
some
vanilla
and
wheatiness
in
the
middle
mixed
with
clove
and
yeast
no
real
sourness
to
speak
of
wasnt
really
expecting
such
a
good
wit
from
a
widely
distributed
beer
coriander
in
the

in
the
short
aftertaste
lightly
cloudy

with

easy

overall

i
have
had
this
once
from
the
tap
memory
better
than
from
the
bottle
the
original
of
its
class
hoegaarden
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
little
flecks
of
yeast
churn
at
the
bottom
of
its
cloudy
yellow
pour
the
creamy
white
head
has
delicious
aromas
of
cloves
bananas
and
lemon
citrus
it
tastes
initially
tart
and
then
sweetens
to
light
grains
citrus
fruit
and
spices
its
light
body
is
extremely
refreshing
and
finishes
on
a
lingering
sweet
note
hoegaarden
is
quite
possibly
the
most
drinkable
summer
thirst
quenching
beer
ive
ever
had
nikki
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
a
night
not
overpowering
alcohol
and
i
enjoy
the
taste
some
people
might
find
the
taste
tiresome
after
a
while
though
hmm
the
tap
here
might
be
watered
down
slightly
ive
had
it
on
tap
elsewhere
here
in
beijing
and
had
a
much
better
impression
pours
the
color
of
apple
juice
with
a
two
finger
head
that
has
good
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
is
fantastic
sweet
fruity
the
taste
does
not
match
the
smell
i
was
expecting
more
taste
given
the
smell
the
taste
is
light
but
what
is
there
is
good
a
nice
acidic
flavor
with
the
addition
of
something
resembling
apple
would
be
great
on
a
hot
day
fruity
and
light
but
not
as
full
a
beer
as
id
normally
like
we
did
a
blind
tastetest
with
blue
moon
designed
after
it
but
could
tell
almost
no
difference
besides
color
great
with
whatever
youre
eating
and
with
almost
all
company
besides
the
super
beersnobs
and
the

pours
a

with
thick
foamy
white

consisiting
of

this

i
would
love
to
have
around
during
those
hot
houston
summer
days
but
on
my
budget
i
dont
have
the
means
to
get
this
beer
that
much
highly
recommended
the
finish
is
pretty
complex
it
tries
to
be
sweet
but
the
wheat
is
balanced
nicely
by
the
various
spices
only
in
the
finish
did
i
notice
the
orange
peel
hoegaarden
is
definitely
on
my
top
five
list
it
doesnt
look
like
much
but
its
really
good
d
i
could
easily
drink
this
anytime
i
look
forward
to
pairing
this
with
breakfast
foods
night
of
course
overall
a
nicely
light
and
refreshing
wit
and
a
staple
of
the
style
it
had
a
fresh
citrus
and
coriander
aroma
to
start
off
along
with
an
appropriately
pale
color
the
taste
was
delectably
spiced
with
notes
of
wheat
and
citrus
and
was
smooth
going
down
even
smoother
than
those
macrobrews
that
advertise
their
drinkability
could
drink
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
without
adverse
guttural
response
definitely
a
good
choice
for
the
price
way
drinkable
especially
on
hot
days
today
was
cold
and
rainy
but
i
still
enjoyed
it
my
local
grocery
store
has
this
beer
for
only
7
99
for
a
sixer
which
seems
like
a
great
deal
to
me
nearby
on
the
shelf
is
corona
for
8
69
what
a
messed
up
world
we
live
in
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
magnitudes
more
corona
sells
over
the
cheaper
hoegaarden
oh
well
more
for
me
overalla
fine
white
ale
ive
had
better
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
you
will
find
on
tap
in
most
areas
solid
job
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
great
beer
pours
a
nice
cloudy
yellow
as
expected
but
this
taste
of
it
is
just
unique
very
full
in
body
and
has
a
nice
spicy
kick
to
it
while
going
down
smooth
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
all
the
way
thru
would
buy
a
sixer
of
this
in
future
for
sure
d
a
good
tasting
easy
drinking
witbbier
pleasantly
complex
i
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
and
enjoy
it
drinkability
smooth
and
relaxing
drink
in
the
heat
very
drinkable
particularly
on
a
hot
day
it
is
to
be
noted
that
though
this
is
this
brewerys
flagship
original
beer
the
real
original
recipe
was
taken
by
the
original
brewer
to
texas
where
it
eventually
was
laid
to
rest
in
peace
so
sad
however
this
is
still
one
of
the
most
famous
witbiers
available
i
first
tried
it
in
new
zealand
and
was
worth
reviewing
out
of
the
bottle
the
liquid
was
a
milky
straw
gold
color
with
a
bright
white
head
the
foam
both
retained
and
laced
well
throughout
the
aroma
was
classic
orange
zest
coriander
and
tangy
wheat
the
flavors
were
similar
though
the
first
taste
was
floral
hops
and
malt
sweetness
followed
by
the
curacao
orange
zest
and
lemon
flavors
as
well
as
coriander
and
cloves
the
flavors
were
well
blended
with
nothing
dominating
the
others
the
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
i
found
it
great
for
quaffing
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
one
was
still
a
classic
and
for
good
reasons
looks
alot
like
a
pulpy
citrus
drink
with
a
thin
white
head
the
smell
is
like
spices
the
taste
is
exceptionally
spicy
no
getting
around
that
a
very
pleasant
taste
has
a
bubbly
feel
on
the
tongue
so
far
this
is
easily
the
easiest
drinkable
white
beer
ive
tried
4
0
d
not
bad
at
all
but
not
all
that
exciting
no
offtaste
is
a
big
turnon
though
d
spices
and
nonclean
finish
detract
from
the
drinkability
but
overall
a
great
beer
creamy
mouthfeel
drinkable
brew
considering
the
style
but
i
just
cant
take
the
smell
smell
effects
taste
and
this
one
ruins
it
i
wont
have
this
one
again
aroma
is
of
citrus
coriander
is
pretty
powerful
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
coriander
which
gives
it
a
little
too
much
spice
the
balance
of
the
tartness
of
the
lemony
citrus
is
thrown
off
because
of
it
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
medium
to
light
body
i
personally
dont
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
the
flavour
really
isnt
my
thing
but
i
respect
what
it
is
very
tasty
brew
could
easily
kick
back
and
enjoy
several
of
these
any
time
of
the
day
i
would
consider
this
a
gateway
beer
for
anyone
looking
to
branch
out
from
american
macros
light
and
smooth
yet
incredible
flavor
good
beer
ill
have
this
again
in
the
future
but
it
did
not
blow
my
mind
o
a
thoroughly
good
beer
quite
drinkable
and
delicious
an
easy
drinking
and
approachable
wit
very
very
drinkable
medium
body
terrific
summer
beer
no
need
for
lemons
citrus
additions
i
bought
a
12
pack
of
the
stuff
in
bottles
i
poured
it
as
directed
on
the
bottle
lol
and
was
left
with
a
nice
gold
coloured
beer
with
a
nice
head
on
it
took
one
sip
of
it
and
was
like
wow
this
is
what
a
belgian
white
should
taste
like
totally
blows
blue
moon
out
of
the
water
maybe
even
into
outer
space
mouthfeel
is
exceptional
as
far
as
drinkability
is
concerned
i
drank
the
whole
12
pack
in
3
hours
so
i
think
its
right
up
there
with
the
most
drinkable
beers
out
there
this
beer
is
in
my
top
10
right
now
you
need
to
try
this
one
try
a
normal
beer
then
have
a
taste
of
this
the
contrast
due
to
the
spice
is
quite
loud
appearance
is
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
beautiful
white
head
smells
of
wheat
coriander
and
a
slight
citruslemon
scent
tastes
like
a
classic
belgian
white
very
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
slight
tartiness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
its
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
while
youre
griling
some
food
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
beers
d
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
this
is
good
out
of
the
bottle
and
even
better
out
of
the
tap
enjoy

a
solid
rep
for
a
highly
available
belgian
spiced
witbier
i
love
the
look
and
taste
best
of
all
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
its
much
more
than
that
the
mouth
feel
and
taste
are
excellent
and
it
goes
down
very
smooth
i
know
some
bars
put
a
wedge
of
lemon
in
it
but
i
usually
have
mine
straight
up
and
if
you
get
it
in
a
bottle
pour
it
drinking
it
from
a
bottle
is
just
not
as
good
d
it
was
ok
drinkability
i
think
there
may
have
been
a
bit
too
much
coriander
a
pretty
good
summer
witbier
would
pair
nicely
with
a
plate
of
some
fresh
seafood
a
thin
mouthfeel
and
a
very
refreshing
beer
prosit
mk
pours
hazy
pale
yellow
with
12
white
uniform
head
that
dissipates
pretty
slowly
leaving
a
continuous
lace
that
turns
spotty
nice
sour
yeasty
smell
with
a
little
tropical
fruit
and
maybe
a
little
pepper
tastes
about
like
it
smells
initially
with
a
bittersweet
finish
that
comes
up
suddenly
right
at
the
end
of
a
short
lived
aftertaste
smooth
and
creamy
witha
soft
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
this
is
an
easy
drinker
that
is
light
in
carbonation
and
a
nice
flavor
definitely
a
good
summertime
brew
served
in
a
standard
pint
poured
a
hazy
straw
gold
with
a
half
inch
bright
white
head
that
eventually
settled
into
a
broken
skim
nose
was
somewhat
nonexistent
some
citrus
and
corriander
taste
consistent
with
nose
as
well
as
pale
wheat
taste
reminded
me
of
a
cross
between
orangina
and
zima
mouthfeel
was
light
and
somewhat
watery
with
a
clean
dry
finish
easy
drinking
lawnmower
beerbut
their
are
much
better
witbiers
out
there
this
beer
was
my
gateway
into
the
world
of
belgian
brews
tasty
stuff
and
a
decent
session
beer
thats
a
nice
diversion
from
my
usual
mmmmm
tasty
md
light
bodied
and
a
touch
thin
on
the
feel
well
carbonated
and
very
drinkable
not
the
best
wit
out
there
but
a
nice
dependable
standby
popular
beer
for
good
reason
really
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
definitely
quaffable
and
the
wellknown
benchmark
for
the
witbier
style
drinkability
refreshing
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
very
drinkable
beer
thats
nice
as
a
refresher
on
a
hot
day
like
most
witbiers
are
appearance
is
a
nice
hazy
golden
with
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
streaming
upwards
smells
citrusy
and
herby
with
quite
a
bit
of
the
yeast
coming
out
as
well
mouthfeel
is
nice
because
of
the
fizzyness
which
i
am
a
fan
of
very
light
on
the
tongue
with
a
fair
amount
of
sourness
nice
fruit
tones
as
it
goes
down
as
well
overall
a
very
pleasing
beer
nothing
extraordinary
but
nice
to
wash
down
a
summer
meal
on
the
deck
with
overall
different
refreshing
and
clean
very
quenchable
and
sessionable
a
nice
better
alternative
to
light
beers
overall
its
not
bad
but
i
have
definitely
had
better
like
i
said
already
there
are
others
that
have
a
bit
more
flavor
punch
in
them
served
from
a
bottle
poured
into
an
official
hoegaarden
glass
d
the
mouthfeel
makes
you
want
more
but
the
overdose
on
the
spices
keeps
me
away
im
good
with
one
of
these
then
its
on
to
something
else
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
light
yet
flavorful
a
great
easytofind
choice
for
the
warm
summer
months
this
is
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
into
drinking
better
beer
and
its
always
a
reliable
beer
to
fall
back
on
especially
for
a
session
beer
or
in
the
warm
weather
d
its
fine
on
a
summer
day
and
the
abv
is
certainly
reasonable
but
i
would
like
a
bit
more
adventure
pours
very
cloudy
strawcoloured
and
milky
with
a
slick
fading
white
head
strong
wheat
twang
in
the
aroma
yeasty
coriander
spicy
phenolics
sweet
and
prickly
in
the
mouth
full
bodied
and
round
slightly
tart
and
citrusy
mild
and
smooth
but
definitely
not
boring
the
ultimate
refreshing
beer
spicy
complex
and
smooth
i
could
do
with
three
or
four
of
these
next
time
i
mow
the
lawn
d
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
not
my
fav
but
at
4
8
its
very
managable
notes
this
is
a
pretty
good
brew
but
south
hamptom
double
white
has
really
been
the
only
witbier
that
i
think
i
have
ever
brought
more
then
once
d
probably
not
the
best
belgian
wit
i
have
had
but
a
damn
fine
one
an
infinitely
drinkable
summertime
ale
d
if
it
wasnt
so
expensive
i
would
drink
it
more
often
d
the
beer
is
soft
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
i
would
have
liked
more
character
from
the
citrus
and
a
tad
more
spiciness
but
the
cleanness
of
the
wheat
itself
defines
drinkability
very
good
for
the
style
ive
had
the
highandmighty
st
bernardus
wit
and
find
few
differences
between
it
and
hoegaarden
even
though
its
relatively
massproduced
its
a
beer
youll
want
to
check
out
for
a
great
witbier
flavor
youll
want
more
than
one
pours
a
hazy
but
bright
blonde
color
with
a
fluffy
bleach
white
head
aromas
present
are
lemon
zest
coriander
and
maybe
a
touch
of
vanilla
taste
is
a
bit
lemony
up
front
with
more
dominant
notes
of
clove
yeast
and
slightly
sweet
fruitiness
the
vanilla
from
the
nose
is
nowhere
to
be
found
somewhat
thin
on
body
but
very
clean
on
the
palate
and
very
tasty
one
could
definately
knock
down
a
6er
of
these
in
one
sitting
during
the
summertime
nice
brew
finish
is
pleasingly
tart
and
appetizing
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
is
high
since
the
flavor
is
so
light
and
smooth
its
pretty
widely
available
so
its
a
good
example
of
the
style
that
most
people
should
be
able
to
try
drinks
easy
but
a
little
too
thin
mild
mmmm
a
tasty
brew
this
beers
cloudy
golden
color
makes
it
look
delicious
and
satisfying
you
pull
it
in
for
a
sip
and
a
fruity
yeasty
orange
peel
and
coriander
aroma
hits
you
getting
you
prepared
for
the
taste
citrus
fruit
juice
yeasty
coriander
esters
of
banana
and
pineapple
faint
bitterness
towards
the
end
thick
and
crisp
there
are
plenty
of
weak
wheat
beers
out
there
but
this
one
makes
you
feel
like
you
a
drinking
clouds
of
rich
spices
and
juice
im
on
cloud
9
with
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
beats
this
beer
it
has
a
great
appearance
as
well
with
a
nice
yellow
color
and
a
white
foam
easy
to
drink
with
nice
smooth
flavors
cheap
too
this
is
another
beer
and
wit
in
paticular
thative
been
consuming
for
years
and
one
of
the
first
after
moving
beyond
the
mass
produced
stuff
for
one
reason
or
another
i
have
not
reviewed
until
today
poured
into
pint
glass
at
tracks
in
penn
station
manhattan
whilst
waiting
for
my
lirr
train
to
celebrate
my
mothers
birthday
after
taking
out
the
lemon
the
barkeep
placed
on
the
pint
partially
hazy
golden
with
a
half
finger
head
and
decent
lacing
that
faded
to
a
half
cap
very
quickly
bottom
half
is
almost
clear
nose
is
mild
yeast
and
lemon
and
estery
dash
taste
is
moderate
yeasty
with
lemon
accents
mouthfeel
has
spiced
crispness
at
the
start
but
weakens
much
to
my
chagrin
0r
more
succintly
it
gets
watery
kinda
chewy
to
start
and
carbonation
remains
with
the
legs
unless
my
pallet
has
matured
vastly
or
as
many
others
have
mentioned
th
taste
and
body
are
not
what
i
remember
do
recall
reading
they
went
back
to
old
brewry
and
recipe
but
not
sure
not
to
say
this
is
not
a
fine
brew
by
any
means
and
would
recommend
to
all
geeks
and
neophytes
alike
obviously
theres
a
flood
of
belgian
wits
or
styled
wits
out
there
this
is
not
the
best
nor
is
it
the
worst
there
are
far
batter
american
made
variations
there
are
also
far
worse
but
if
you
want
one
that
satisfies
all
wit
requirements
with
the
added
bonus
of
actually
being
from
belgium
hoegaarden
is
your
guy
pours
an
almost
white
palest
yellow
w
a
fluffy
white
head
which
sticks
around
for
a
bit
leaving
a
nice
broken
lace
in
my
chalice
a
bready
spice
filled
aroma
coriander
and
pepper
some
fruits
present
appleoranges
mostly
a
crisp
slightly
tart
flavor
quite
similar
to
the
smell
a
soft
malt
flavor
with
lots
of
spice
a
peppery
front
with
some
curacaou
oranges
and
a
powderish
taste
midway
some
faint
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
light
bodied
brew
feels
tingly
on
my
tounge
plenty
co2
a
fantastic
wit
and
quite
drinkable
as
well
i
admit
when
i
first
saw
this
beer
i
called
it
like
everyone
else
does
hoegarden
when
it
is
really
whogarden
the
brewers
even
put
a
handy
phonetic
spelling
on
the
sixpack
handle
anyway
for
a
mass
produced
wit
this
one
has
some
decent
flavor
pours
a
bright
canary
yellow
with
a
slight
haze
aroma
is
of
fresh
orange
peel
a
little
floral
some
coriander
taste
is
smooth
and
bursting
with
citrus
and
zest
great
as
a
apertif
and
a
good
summer
quencher
you
can
find
it
at
most
local
grocers
d
the
classic
belgian
wit
a
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
summer
beer
this
sixpack
didnt
last
very
long
cheers
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
sticks
around
leaves
some
lacing
as
you
drink
the
smell
is
sweet
i
picked
up
some
banana
and
clove
probably
from
the
style
of
yeast
which
was
also
present
this
one
has
a
big
flavor
sweet
light
and
yeasty
a
great
balance
very
bubbly
and
lots
of
carbonation
this
one
is
a
light
and
enjoyable
beer
with
great
flavor
i
recommend
checking
this
one
out
i
first
tried
this
beer
many
years
ago
on
a
weekend
trip
to
brussels
it
has
now
become
one
of
the
staples
of
my
beer
fridge
theres
nothing
crazy
about
it
but
i
think
that
is
why
i
like
it
it
pours
a
nice
cloudy
white
hence
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
enjoyable
you
can
taste
the
body
in
the
beer
the
taste
of
the
coriander
is
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
aspects
of
the
drink
i
always
recommend
this
beer
to
my
friends
who
are
interested
in
taking
a
step
up
to
some
more
enjoyable
beers
after
poring
the
second
one
i
added
a
razberry
lambick
about
10
this
was
the
purfict
1
2
combo
overall
this
classic
example
of
a
classic
style
holds
up
to
its
many
imitators
a
solid
goto
brew
when
in
a
bar
who
thinks
killians
is
adventurous
d
melow
and
drinkable
great
example
of
a
wheat
beer
the
drink
poured
with
a
really
murky
pale
gold
color
decent
lacing
but
the
head
evaporated
quickly
the
aromas
were
predominately
citrus
in
flavoring
and
was
not
too
overpowering
the
taste
was
very
sweet
with
a
great
earthy
aftertaste
carbonation
was
excellent
and
helped
the
drink
be
nice
and
crisp
overall
pretty
good
overall
very
crisp
refreshing
and
really
tasty
great
witbier
d
definitely
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
a
cold
winter
night
the
hoegaarden
is
one
of
the
best
example
of
a
witbier
on
the
market
i
just
wish
it
had
just
a
little
more
flavor
i
think
this
beer
was
very
bad
with
a
chemical
aftertaste
my
friend
brought
it
over
and
was
sayin
how
good
it
was
he
brought
over
hoegaarden
and
i
bought
bodingtons
iand
i
thought
the
bodington
ale
was
much
much
better
this
beer
should
not
have
this
high
of
a
rating
on
here
its
even
higher
ten
bass
come
on
now
d
this
is
reliable
and
tasty
but
its
not
that
exciting
honestly
it
can
be
a
bit
underwhelming
at
times
i
liked
this
one
a
lot
more
when
i
didnt
like
beer
it
realy
blew
me
away
my
first
time
i
couldnt
get
this
here
in
tenn
untill
recently
and
i
grabed
it
the
first
time
i
saw
it
i
wish
i
had
only
bought
a
single
really
outstanding
drinkability
and
incredibly
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
an
excellent
wit
ill
definitely
try
again
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
very
dry
finish
that
seems
to
be
the
theme
with
this
beer
dry
not
too
bad
though
ive
had
better
wits
before
note
a
bandaid
offflavor
is
often
indicative
of
infected
yeast
i
think
thats
whats
happening
here
ill
review
this
benchmark
belgian
wit
again
at
a
later
date
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
most
refreshing
and
delightful
on
a
warm
summer
day
drinkability
is
a
must
hoegaarden
is
a
great
beer
to
quench
thirst
with
but
also
a
fun
beer
to
drink
at
dinner
and
at
live
concerts
theres
certainly
nothing
but
fun
that
comes
from
this
stuff
i
did
find
this
one
very
drinkable
its
not
a
heavyweight
beer
so
easy
to
drink
more
than
one
at
a
sitting
i
find
it
a
good
beer
for
just
enjoying
and
not
having
to
worry
much
about
high
alcohol
content
or
being
so
heavy
it
feels
you
up
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
drink
with
friends
just
for
fun
and
want
something
better
than
a
mass
market
brand
overall
a
decent
buy
this
was
on
sale
for
7
996
pack
at
wegmans
its
a
bit
lacking
in
body
and
somewhat
in
taste
although
the
smell
was
pretty
nifty
but
it
is
an
ok
beer
nonetheless
and
i
may
buy
it
again
on
occasion
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
cheap
belgian
wheat
this
would
appear
to
be
the
obvious
wheat
alternative
to
the
eurolagers
an
ok
wheat
beer
for
those
on
a
tight
budget
drinkability
gets
good
ratings
a
good
example
of
a
witbier
d
very
good
drinkability
prime
example
per
style
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
smooth
and
the
refreshing
quality
makes
this
a
very
drinkable
beer
fairly
drinkable
however
the
lively
carbonation
is
too
much
for
me
ill
stop
at
one
12
oz
bottle
into
glass
pours
a
carbonated
hazy
yellow
with
a
quickly
diminishing
white
head
smells
earthy
and
spicy
with
some
banana
also
tastes
like
it
smells
very
light
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
has
mass
appeal
the
pint
pours
a
dull
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
big
smooth
white
head
and
thick
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
clean
and
strong
lemon
and
nutmeg
really
a
bright
and
unique
masterpiece
for
the
nose
the
flavor
is
wheat
and
light
citrus
fairly
aqueous
and
very
drinkable
but
it
also
has
a
great
creamy
quality
like
milk
very
fine
carbonation
this
seemed
so
much
better
than
the
recent
version
i
had
from
a
bottle
that
was
ok
but
this
was
really
a
tastey
treat
to
me
and
i
dont
typically
go
for
witbiers
particularly
i
could
have
consumed
many
more
had
i
not
had
an
early
morning
schedule
to
contend
with
a
very
nice
surprise
look
for
this
on
tap
and
enjoy
pours
a
cloudy
very
pale
golden
color
with
a
soft
looking
snow
white
head
that
leaves
some
patchy
lacing
as
it
falls
the
nose
is
fresh
and
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
spice
and
yeast
reminds
me
of
tropical
fruit
bubble
gum
flavors
with
an
assertive
amount
of
hops
and
spicy
yeast
the
lightness
of
body
and
subtle
dryness
are
enjoyable
from
start
to
finish
a
highly
drinkable
whitbier
that
is
full
of
complexity
and
character
good
stuff
carbonation
spices
up
on
the
palate
nicely
and
balances
really
good
with
the
acidity
from
the
fruit
a
favorite
for
sure
poured
in
american
pint
glass
according
to
directions
very
pale
yellow
color
appropriately
similar
to
wheat
but
almost
foggy
like
the
liquid
left
over
after
cooking
seafood
disappointing
head
that
disappeared
immediately
though
it
had
nice
coloration
creamy
in
texture
though
not
very
full
bodied
clean
flavour
sweet
and
wellrounded
with
a
hint
of
faint
bitterness
in
the
middle
finishes
well
without
leaving
an
aftertaste
cleanses
the
palate
wouldnt
reccommend
for
heavier
foods
but
excellent
to
pair
with
lighter
fare
d
this
is
a
good
witbier
very
drinkable
because
it
has
some
good
flavors
that
go
along
with
the
summer
i
enjoyed
it
this
beer
poured
a
pale
straw
color
cloudy
as
it
is
unfiltered
it
had
a
nice
white
head
the
smell
had
a
very
strong
citrus
sent
the
taste
matched
the
smell
with
citrus
and
a
hint
of
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
good
overall
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
was
good
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
also
has
good
flavor
it
is
a
good
summer
beer
scratch
scratch
poured
a
hazy
bright
yellow
straight
out
of
12
oz
bottle
served
with
a
wedge
of
orange
smell
was
mildy
effervescent
with
notes
of
clove
an
banana
taste
was
really
good
mildmannered
and
sweet
with
clove
banana
and
citrus
notes
overall
just
a
good
tasty
wheat
beer
i
definitely
recommend
d
very
drinkable
because
of
the
light
body
wellbalanced
and
smooth
flavor
and
pleasant
aroma
its
sessionable
too
this
style
isnt
one
of
my
favorites
but
ill
probably
be
picking
up
some
hoegaarden
again
hoegaarden
is
one
of
my
favorite
belgian
white
ales
i
first
was
introduced
to
it
while
visiting
jacksonville
fl
at
the
european
street
cafe
and
now
it
is
available
here
in
little
ole
tn
pours
a
nice
head
smell
is
fruity
with
the
coriander
coming
through
apperance
is
cloudy
white
after
all
it
is
a
white
ale
taste
is
very
good
no
bitterness
or
aftertaste
just
the
coriander
and
citrus
like
flavors
coming
through
with
slight
hop
undertones
d
very
refreshing
great
beer
for
the
hot
summer
days
highly
drinkable
almost
a
5
this
is
a
great
example
of
an
original
belgian
staple
beer
one
of
the
best
belgians
available
in
the
us
great
head
with
a
fruity
and
balanced
body
crisp
coriander
finish
there
seems
to
be
a
hint
of
orange
or
citrus
intermingled
in
the
body
some
where
in
the
middle
as
well
d
very
light
crisp
refreshing
flavor
clean
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
could
be
a
bit
off
from
the
age
i
proclaim
it
a
decent
wit
all
in
alla
drinkable
brew
b
ut
overpriced
even
as
an
import
at
10
a
sixpack
its
a
good
beer
but
not
a
real
good
value
d
a
session
brew
if
you
like
these
flavors
i
know
they
can
be
offensive
to
some
but
i
enjoy
it
on
occasion
i
really
like
this
beer
and
it
remains
one
of
my
favorite
session
ales
as
well
as
a
good
beer
to
pass
on
to
those
guests
wanting
something
a
little
different
while
it
is
on
the
pricey
side
ultimately
its
a
decent
value
considering
the
product
by
far
my
favorite
witbier
a
good
respectable
beer
but
honestly
it
seems
watered
down
needs
to
be
dialed
up
a
notch
in
anycase
though
its
a
very
drinkable
tasty
beer
beautiful
lemon

having
regularly

very
drinkable
light
and
clean

a
nice

quite
good
d
this
is
intensely
drinkable
not
only
does
it
have
that
great
spicy
smell
and
taste
but
its
light
has
a
low
abv
and
a
very
clean
finish
of
all
the
beers
i
have
reviewed
i
always
find
some
reason
why
i
probably
wouldnt
session
with
them
with
the
exception
of
maybe
a
few
pilsners
this
beer
i
can
finally
say
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
me
its
something
i
could
see
myself
drinking
in
any
situation
and
enjoying
many
of

for
a

afternoon
outside
very
easy
to

nice
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
warmer
months
the
classic
white
ale
that
spawned
just
about
every
summer
beer
in
the
u
s
d
drinkability
is
very
high
on
this
brew
while
easily
found
in
most
places
i
have
seen
the
smell
and
taste
always
make
this
a
winner
price
is
very
reasonable
too
plan
on
throwing
multiple
sixes
down
throughout
the
summer

fairly
dense

away

remains

and
slight
bitter

fizzy
good
balance
between

feeling

pours
just
a
slightly
hazy
extremely
light
straw
color
with
tons
of
dense
white
head
the
aroma
bursts
forth
candy
sweetness
with
tones
of
lemon
coriander
vanilla
and
a
whole
host
of
other
spices
it
doesnt
come
across
as
being
especially
zesty
just
herbal
and
earthy
on
the
palate
things
become
quite
a
bit
more
zesty
as
the
spices
truly
are
all
over
the
place
herbal
menthol
notes
really
dominate
followed
by
citrus
chamomile
and
coriander
the
finish
is
dry
and
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
but
creamy
overall
a
very
interesting
beer
and
a
complex
blend
of
spices
give
it
supreme
drinkability
and
i
imagine
a
good
match
for
a
variety
of
foods

classic

hoegaarden
was
the
first
belgian
beer
that
i
really
liked
and
opened
up
a
world
of
new
and
exciting
beer
to
me
tastes
like
late
springearly
summer
wasnt
my
first
wont
be
my
last
d
could
easily
drink
a
12er
on
a
warm
summers
night
but
would
rather
pound
a
pulaner
or
german
blonde
liquid
sun
shine
poured
into
its
signature
tumbler
glass
color
was
light
yellow
and
hazy
with
a
foamy
white
head
it
has
an
inviting
aroma
of
wheat
citrus
and
spice
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
with
a
wonderful
balance
of
wheaty
malts
belgian
yeast
dried
orange
peel
and
coriander
nice
sweettart
finish
with
good
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
this
is
a
great
summer
time
beer
and
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
overall
crisp
tasteful
and
perfect
for
a
warm
spring
day
d
very
drinkable
went
down
easy
both
before
and
during
a
meal
excellent
example
of
the
style
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
found
that
i
hit
the
bottom
of
the
glass
before
i
was
even
done
analyzing
it
extremely
drinkable
flavorful
but
not
filling
i
could
do
quite
a
few
of
these
without
a
problem
d
pretty
drinkable
and
quite
enjoyable
will
remember
this
beer
during
summer
cook
outs
or
mowing
the
lawn
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
slightly
bready
filling
the
mouth
and
sticking
behind
after
the
beer
has
been
swallowed
i
could
easily
drink
a
12
pack
of
these
beers
without
thinking
twice
and
i
have
great
summertime
barbecue
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
wont
fill
you
up
or
leave
you
bloated
noteexcellent
brew
with
a
nice
warm
spiceall
in
all
worth
drinking
my
favorite
easy
to
find
import
the
beer
that
non
beer
bars
have
for
me
a
fine
beer
just
so
drinkable
and
refreshing
the
prototypical
witbier
very
good
brew
well
worth
it
worth
the
price
this
is
a
great
white
ale
it
has
a
good
look
especially
in
the
traditional
hexagonal
glass
that
the
bottle
suggests
to
drink
from
the
aroma
seems
to
be
quite
pleasant
the
taste
of
this
beer
has
always
pleased
my
taste
buds
enough
to
rate
this
beer
as
one
of
my
favorites
on
my
list
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
considering
it
is
only
4
9
alcohol
the
texture
of
this
beer
is
pretty
nice
not
to
thick
nice
on
a
hot
day
this
has
been
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
think
this
one
can
change
the
average
domestic
beer
drinkers
perspective
on
higher
quality
beers
d
easy
drinking
wellbalanced
warm
weather
beer
this
beer
was
made
for
texas
where
it
is
often
used
as
a
porch
coolmedown
poundable
in
the
summer
heat
someone
told
me
this
tasted
of
dishwater
so
i
have
put
off
tasting
this
beer
for
a
while
decided
to
give
this
beer
a
an
honest
chance
tonite
and
was
rewarded
with
a
refreshing
brew
this
beer
was
served
a
nice
tan
color
with
a
creamy
head
and
an
orange
slice
it
had
a
crisp
and
refreshing
taste
and
very
clean
finish
i
hade
it
paired
with
a
whole
wheat
pasta
dinner
and
the
wheat
in
the
beer
came
through
very
very
well
i
enjoyed
this
beer
greatly
d
very
refresing
especially
on
a
warm
summer
day
much
like
a
glass
of
lemonade
this
beer
poured
a
pretty
cloudy
yellowishwhite
with
a
singlefinger
fluffy
head
that
lasted
for
the
whole
beer
the
smell
is
yeasty
with
some
citrus
and
banana
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
citrus
that
fades
into
some
clove
spiciness
and
finishes
with
some
fruitiness
the
mouthfeel
is
moderately
carbonated
with
a
decent
thickness
the
sweetness
and
fruitness
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
but
this
wit
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
there
is
very
little
to
absolutely
no
honey
vanilla
coriander
or
orangefruityness
aroma
or
taste
i
was
expecting
a
lot
more
a
great
brunch
beer
the
taste
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
i
liken
it
to
biting
into
an
wheatcoated
orange
slice
thats
already
been
sucked
dry
the
flavors
just
not
all
there
some
orange
peel
and
a
bit
of
juicy
hops
try
desperately
to
leave
an
aftertaste
but
the
overly
carbonated
thin
body
limits
the
enjoyment
i
can
see
myself
enjoying
a
hoegaarden
on
a
warm
spring
day
but
im
glad
my
girfriend
bought
the
six
pack
and
not
me
d
this
is
an
excellent
drinkable
beer
enough
said
fresh
bottle
just
showed
up
in
the
market
best
by
date
of
42809
it
is
22308
d
its
a
good
beer
it
is
probaby
best
with
foods
that
are
not
going
to
overpower
maybe
some
white
fish
and
breads
also
probably
better
enjoyed
in
the
summer
months
than
when
its
cold
outside
a
classic
but
just
tastes
similar
to
every
hefeweizen
and
wit
ive
had
before
not
bad
but
nothing
unique
other
than
the
freakishly
long
lasting
head
coriander
clove
and
lemon
tastes
light
bodied
and
easy
to
drink
if
you
like
those
flavors
in
beer
which
i
dont
particularly
good
if
you
like
the
style
i
would
much
rather
have
a
hoegaarden
than
say
a
bud
and
i
could
drink
as
many
of
them
both
this
beer
was
a
very
unique
and
view
changing
experience
for
me
that
i
will
always
remember
as
the
brew
that
turned
me
into
a
beer
drinker
and
i
highly
recoment
it
it
brought
me
into
the
world
of
beer
and
every
new
beer
i
taste
is
always
compared
to
this
one
in
my
mind
as
a
factor
on
how
i
like
it
with
the
exception
of
blue
moon
if
a
beer
isnt
cloudy
and
full
of
sediment
like
hoegaarden
is
i
put
it
right
back
on
the
shelf
d
good
kegger
for
a
special
occasion
if
you
could
get
it
d
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
if
my
mind
didnt
know
better
an
extremely
complex
beer
that
reveals
more
and
more
character
as
its
consumed
overall
definitely
a
refreshing
drinkable
beer
and
lately
it
has
been
on
sale
at
one
of
the
local
package
stores
so
i
have
been
drinking
more
of
it
probably
more
appropriate
for
a
hot
summer
day
though
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
in
the
hot
summer
months
after
you
just
cut
your
lawn
its
cool
and
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
white
head
some
decent
lacing
here
smells
of
lemon
and
spices
such
as
cinnamon
and
coriander
taste
is
watery
with
some
classic
witbier
ester
notes
and
too
much
spice
mouthfeel
is
overcarbonated
and
thin
pretty
easy
to
drink
if
theyre
cold
but
a
far
cry
from
the
better
witbiers
drinkability
added
one
bottle
as
part
of
a
mixed
6
pack
i
would
definitely
have
this
again
low
in
alcohol
this
would
make
for
a
good
summer
quaffer
that
i
will
look
out
for
in
the
summer
when
it
turns
hot
i
drank
a
lot
of
hops
today
and
wanted
a
change
i
always
have
a
belgian
witbier
around
for
nights
like
these
this
one
is
a
very
respectable
witbier
and
always
easy
to
find
at
a
good
price
too
along
with
being
very
drinkable
solid
all
around
beer
its
not
too
hard
to
find
and
always
enjoyable

that
disappeared
quickly
but
left
decent
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
bready
with
slight
spiciness
and
banana
taste
is
yeasty
with
a
slight
banana
twinge
to
it
mouthfeel
is
fuller
than
expected
with
a
dry
finish
to
it
a
very
drinkable
brew
definitely
wont
be
the
last
one
i
drink
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
dicipated
quickly
but
had
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
the
smell
of
this
beer
is
wheatwheatwheat
and
yeast
the
taste
is
also
very
much
wheat
but
for
a
witbier
it
is
very
clean
and
crisp
doesnt
leave
much
of
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
very
light
and
watery
but
with
a
clean
aftertaste
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
i
could
use
this
as
a
summer
sessionable
all
summer
long
notes
a
great
witbier
thats
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
delicious
if
you
enjoy
the
style
the
only
drawback
is
that
it
cost
a
little
more
than
it
should
i
also
hear
that
if
you
drink
it
in
belgium
that
it
has
more
of
a
flavor
kick
that
in
does
here
i
guess
it
loses
a
little
something
on
the
plane
ride
over
here
nonetheless
its
an
enjoyable
witbier
the
bottom
line
i
have
hoegaarden
on
occasion
because
bars
which
are
slightly
upscale
tend
to
carry
it
its
not
one
of
my
favourites
in
the
style
and
it
wont
shock
you
in
any
way
but
its
a
perfectly
tasty
and
serviceable
example
of
its
style
just
be
sure
that
you
get
the
lemon
out
of
the
beer
asap
if
its
served
that
way
white
color
nice
spicy
flavor
the
spiciness
fades
as
you
drink
leaving
a
crisp
wheat
flavor
did
i
mention
that
i
love
this
beer
d
probably
very
drinkable
if
it
hits
your
fancy
at
the
moment
very
popular
in
belgium
d
good
a
very
solid
beer
actually
the
first
beer
that
i
ever
had
in
a
pitcher
what
a
treat
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
copious
amount
of
ultra
white
head
smell
is
banana
yeasty
and
some
light
fruity
aromas
but
mostly
this
one
is
about
spice
and
clove
dominates
taste
is
crisp
and
fresh
with
a
limited
amount
of
carbonation
for
this
style
a
good
beer
for
the
style
but
overall
it
did
not
wow
me
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
special
wouldnt
buy
it
again
as
im
not
keen
to
the
style
oa
a
very
drinkable
nonoffending
beer
that
will
serve
as
a
great
wittbeer
for
the
masses
refreshing
as
a
summer
breeze
it
has
a
classic
belgian
yeasty
smell
to
me
the
taste
has
a
faint
citrus
to
it
and
coriander
in
the
finish
of
the
drink
in
the
mouth
it
is
crisp
and
clean
and
light
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
it
has
a
well
in
the
middle
where
the
bubble
rise
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
to
release
their
carbonation
cool
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
after
poured
into
a
glass
it
developed
a
large
foamy
head
that
went
down
relatively
quickly
it
had
a
nice
light
smell
of
a
fruit
i
would
say
banana
it
had
a
nice
crisp
refreshing
taste
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
it
reminded
of
sponge
cake
for
some
reason
the
beer
itself
didnt
feel
too
heavy
nor
too
light
all
of
this
made
it
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
that
i
would
definitely
pick
up
again
i
used
to
view
this
as
the
perfect
summer
beer
but
then
i
began
to
explore
more
beers
and
its
status
has
paled
somewhat
im
sure
most
people
have
tried
hoegaarden
because
of
its
ready
availability
but
here
are
a
few
notes
typical
clouded
gold
wheat
beer
appearance
in
the
ridiculously
big
glass
large
bubbly
white
head
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
of
spice
coriander
and
lemon
crisp
grainy
taste
with
citrus
accents
packaged
in
a
fairly
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
refreshing
but
far
from
spectacular
pretty
good
but
not
my
favorite
beer
the
color
is
a
very
pale
yellow
and
was
served
with
slices
of
lemon
in
it
a
little
too
light
for
my
tastes
but
very
popular
among
my
friends
its
quite
nice
and
drinkable
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
for
myself
hoegaarden
pours
a
cloudy
light
whitelemon
color
with
a
fluffy
milk
white
head
it
smells
of
sweet
lemon
zest
and
vanilla
along
with
some
spicy
yeast
it
is
light
creamy
and
refreshingly
carbonated
as
it
goes
down
the
taste
is
lightly
sweet
vanilla
and
lemon
the
wheat
and
yeast
are
also
light
and
it
finishes
with
a
bit
of
spice
quite
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
all
in
all
a
solid
wit
this
is
a
great
beer
to
suggest
to
those
who
are
new
to
good
beer
as
it
is
a
solid
first
step
into
what
belgian
beer
can
be
like
the
beer
looks
good
with
a
pale
cloudy
body
and
a
wonderful
dense
snow
white
head
the
smell
is
great
fresh
wheat
with
a
touch
of
orange
zest
the
taste
is
surprisingly
mild
mannered
and
easygoing
with
light
carbonation
there
is
just
a
hint
of
coriander
and
orange
on
the
finish
that
is
really
pleasurable
its
exceptionally
easy
to
drink
dvery
nice
beer
if
you
are
in
the
mood
i
might
get
tired
of
it
i
dont
find
anything
about
it
that
makes
me
want
to
come
back
and
have
more
of
it
maybe
if
i
had
it
in
belgium
it
would
be
different
freshness
of
this
would
certainly
matter
and
make
these
flavors
more
pronounced
pours
a
pale
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
decent
lace
of
head
smell
is
all
wheat
and
not
much
else
taste
is
that
of
other
wheat
beers
lots
of
phenol
flavor
mouthfeel
is
lightly
carbonated
and
crisp
with
a
slight
dryness
toward
the
end
im
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
because
of
the
phenol
flavors
but
i
tried
to
be
impartial
and
so
this
beer
comes
out
a
tad
above
average
for
me
if
i
had
to
drink
a
wheat
beer
this
would
a
decent
choice
d
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
a
true
session
beer
d
easliy
could
drink
many
of
these
poured
a
nice
light
straw
color
more
pale
than
golden
with
a
great
head
but
little
lacing
has
a
nice
clean
scent
hints
of
wheat
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
overwhelmed
by
citrus
though
its
very
light
and
refreshing
but
tastes
like
a
couple
of
orange
peels
were
squeezed
right
into
it
before
drinking
goes
down
smooth
id
drink
another
if
bought
for
me
but
i
wouldnt
get
it
on
my
own
the
mouthfeel
is
what
makes
this
beer
for
me
so
good
my
only
beef
with
this
beer
is
that
it
is
grossly
overpriced
but
all
for
the
better
as
i
feel
i
must
treat
myself
to
it
on
special
occasions
it
is
a
very
full
bodied
witbier
very
tasty
but
not
too
fruity
smooth
as
silk
if
the
allure
of
gold
could
be
transferred
into
a
taste
it
would
be
very
similar
to
hoegaarden
i
am
certain
sampled
again
this
time
ondraft
at
dundees
the
lace
sticks
to
the
glass
and
it
remains
good
all
around
imo
although
not
as
good
as
i
remembered
when
i
reviewed
the
bottle
about
eight
months
ago
still
i
had
a
hard
day
and
wanted
to
mellow
out
on
a
light
fruity
beer
at
dundees
i
thought
it
was
cool
to
see
it
served
in
its
hexagonal
glass
if
you
like
witbiers
this
is
one
for
you
it
has
a
nice
cloudy
appearance
and
a
decent
and
not
overwhelming
aroma
it
has
that
orangey
flavor
typical
of
most
witbiers
its
very
refreshing
and
tasty
this
isnt
one
of
the
most
impressive
beers
ever
brewed
but
nonetheless
worth
your
time
i
am
drinking
this
beer
for
the
first
time
today
very
light
color
with
a
cloudy
look
almost
hefewisen
looking
almost
a
bit
of
a
tangy
aroma
not
much
different
than
any
avg
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
almost
too
thick
for
as
light
as
it
drinks
smooth
going
down
i
dont
really
taste
much
but
the
wheat
and
hops
a
bit
of
an
aftertaste
but
not
unpleasant
just
a
bit
bitter
d
light
and
refreshing
but
i
think
it
is
a
little
overrated
it
was
good
dont
get
me
wrong
but
it
was
not
as
incredible
as
others
very
easy
to
drink
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
spend
the
8
or
9
bucks
on
a
six
pack
d
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
if
you
like
the
style
i
dont
but
i
wont
hold
that
against
a
good
beer
you
have
to
like
this
style
and
a
lot
of
people
dont
but
if
you
do
this
one
is
a
winner
d
refreshing
and
tastyfits
style
to
perfection
very
enjoyable
and
recommended
the
taste
is
citrusy
w
hints
orange
and
peach
and
the
wheat
sediments
make
it
very
smooth
although
it
is
not
a
complex
flavor
at
all
and
the
spices
which
overpower
the
wheat
are
still
barely
noticable
because
of
this
you
can
just
sit
back
and
keep
pouring
it
down
your
gullet
for
the
price
almost
10
for
a
six
pack
where
i
live
and
its
easy
drinkability
i
love
this
beer
and
believe
it
or
not
this
is
one
of
my
most
favorable
reviews
poured
from
the
bottle
a
pale
white
color
with
a
touch
of
yellow
head
white
as
snow
small
amount
of
lacing
smelled
of
citrus
banana
and
honey
taste
was
that
of
banana
with
a
citrus
hint
kind
of
refreshing
and
light
almost
a
little
bland
though
easy
to
drink
in
that
there
is
nothing
strong
here
at
all
i
didnt
detect
much
aftertaste
at
all
not
highly
recommended
but
its
not
bad
either
d
this
is
a
nice
wit
good
wheat
and
citrus
flavors
drinkability
a
suitable
witbier
but
the
flavors
are
so
light
as
to
bypass
refreshing
and
wind
up
being
bland
poured
from
bottle
10

pours
very
light
golden
honey
with
white
undertones
and
some
swirling
sediment
head
retention
was
light
with
trim
around
the
glass
updated
regularly
by
large
carbonation
bubbles
yeasty
and
floral
aroma
cant
smell
the
citrus
very
much
spices
are
supported
by
the
carbonation
and
overpower
the
wheat
the
carbonation
fades
and
the
flavor
left
behind
in
your
mouth
is
the
citrus
and
banana
i
find
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
watery
and
high
on
the
carbonation
a
little
less
carbonation
and
more
body
would
make
for
a
more
drinkable
beer
disclaimer
i
havent
found
a
white
that
i
really
enjoy
although
i
do
like
all
other
types
of
wheat
poured
from
a
bottle
with
a
12
01
08
drink
by
date
the
color
is
a
nice
golden
honey
that
is
cloudy
and
topped
by
a
nice
one
finger
white
head
the
head
sticks
around
very
well
the
aroma
is
fairly
week
but
has
mostly
a
banana
smell
there
is
also
some
bread
with
honey
aromas
in
the
glass
too
the
taste
has
some
mild
spiciness
to
it
there
is
also
a
hint
of
orange
that
is
described
on
the
label
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
light
taste
is
bannanas
yeast
and
a
bit
of
lemoncitrus
zest
interesting
quaffable
but
nothing
to
write
home
and
rave
about
its
unique
look
is
probably
not
a
plus
but
its
definitely
weird
overall
i
wavered
between
a
2
5
and
a
3
on
drinkablity
and
i
gave
it
the
3
i
guess
for
the
type
beer
it
is
its
acceptable
but
not
outstanding
or
very
memorable
i
wont
be
picking
this
up
again
but
for
those
who
enjoy
this
style
of
beer
its
probably
worth
at
least
a
look
d
not
a
bad
wit
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
and
for
less
overall
i
personally
prefer
hefe
weizen
to
witbier
so
i
cant
help
but
rate
this
below
my
favourite
hefes
hoegaarden
is
a
good
beer
but
not
the
best
witbier
i
have
tried
d
a
pretty
good
summer
thirst
quencher
tipped
most
of
the
bottle
into
a
working
glass
then
rolled
the
bottle
before
pouring
the
glass
was
filled
with
a
very
pale
hazy
yellow
and
capped
off
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
head
could
have
stuck
around
longer
for
a
wheat
but
still
nice
and
left
a
ring
and
and
small
patches
along
the
side
the
aroma
is
citrusy
like
lemongrass
and
spicy
bready
the
taste
follows
similarly
light
citrus
sweetness
hits
the
tongue
first
followed
by
a
very
balanced
and
mild
bitter
bite
the
finish
is
somewhat
refreshing
and
the
aftertaste
is
again
a
sweet
malty
lemon
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
not
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
very
fitting
not
very
heavy
hoegaarden
is
very
nicely
balanced
light
and
refreshing
enough
to
be
easily
drinkable
its
a
good
representation
of
the
citrusy
wheaty
characteristics
of
the
witbier
style
very
nice
sessionable
macro
offering
a
very
good
intro
to
wheat
beers
followed
the
instructions
printed
on
the
label
poured
the
first
23
into
the
glass
as
normal
swirled
the
remainder
and
poured
the
rest
in
this
made
for
a
beautiful
creamy
head
that
lay
atop
a
cloudy
and
extremely
pale
yellow
very
nearly
white
had
some
nice
lacing
but
had
some
trouble
sticking
delicious
lemony
smell
with
spices
taste
was
excellent
lots
of
fruit
and
spices
most
notably
lemon
with
a
nice
yeasty
flavor
medium
bodied
reminds
me
a
bit
of
delirium
tremens
though
this
would
probably
be
much
better
suited
for
the
summer
and
delirium
tremens
for
winter
as
this
has
far
less
alcohol
drinkability
a
solid
beer
and
very
sessionable
there
are
better
wits
around
but
this
is
easy
to
find
and
its
really
quite
decent
original
of
the
species
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
for
over
15
years
light
yellow
color
white
head
and
smells
of
spice
and
orange
i
originaly
found
this
beer
at
trader
joes
for
cheap
and
very
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
quality
tastes
like
it
smells
and
is
very
drinkable
highly
recommended
i
first
had
this
beer
while
on
vacation
and
in
a
hot
tub
and
it
did
not
disappoint
a
nice
light
golden
beer
with
a
white
foamy
head
hoegaarden
is
very
tasty
with
a
nice
melange
of
flavors
and
mild
spices
orange
was
most
prominent
it
is
decidedly
less
spicy
than
other
belgianstyle
ales
ive
had
but
also
more
accessible
too
its
taste
is
smooth
yet
somewhat
bubbly
nice
and
crisp
it
is
very
refreshing
a
terrific
way
to
beat
the
heat
or
to
kick
back
with
a
few
on
a
porch
terrific
in
warm
weather
and
great
tasting
a
really
good
find
d
a
nice
summer
refresher
nothing
too
complex
but
a
nice
change
from
when
your
sick
of
pale
ales
review
translated
from
french
5262008
i
do
enjoy
this
beer
i
am
a
sucker
for
belgium
whites
this
beer
has
a
good
sense
of
spice
to
it
not
bad
overall
this
is
not
my
favorite
but
it
does
rank
up
there
as
far
as
good
belgium
beers
go
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
the
other
selections
they
have
to
offer
d
i
could
not
have
been
happier
to
be
drinking
this
beer
and
it
went
down
easy
and
smooth
with
plenty
of
strong
flavors
to
savor
1000
light
years
better
than
blue
moon
i
wish
this
beer
could
supplant
the
ubiquity
of
that
awful
drek
had
this
one
tap
last
night
served
in
a
pint
glass
a
very
light
colored
cloudy
beer
a
small
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smell
is
light
with
a
bit
of
lemon
the
taste
is
also
very
light
with
lemon
notes
and
a
bit
of
sourness
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
very
light
flavors
very
nice
a
true
classic
worthy
of
its
reputation
of
the
many
white
beers
out
there
on
the
market
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
great
blend
of
orange
and
coriander
make
this
one
of
the
most
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beers
i
enjoy
it
with
an
orange
peel
which
helps
bring
out
and
accentuate
the
citruslike
taste
although
drinking
it
alone
really
helps
you
appreciate
the
exceptional
taste
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
a
fan
of
white
beers
from
what
ive
heard
and
not
like
this
makes
much
of
a
difference
it
has
won
the
beer
cup
in
its
category
many
times
a
consistent
winner
although
8
99
for
a
sixer
is
a
little
pricey
this
is
worth
it
without
a
doubt
one
of
my
favorite
of
all
time
was
pleasantly
supprised
considering
this
was
my
belgian
style
though
it
had
come
highly
recommended
by
others
to
me
i
would
consider
it
more
translucent
that
cloudy
being
that
i
didnt
see
differences
in
the
opacity
of
the
beer
while
drinking
the
head
stared
out
as
soapsuds
and
dissipated
quickly
but
only
to
a
ring
around
the
collar
that
fell
with
the
drink
was
supprised
at
the
mildness
expecting
a
more
robust
and
forceful
taste
but
was
not
under
whelmed
the
orange
tone
comes
threw
very
well
and
mixes
well
with
the
taste
of
other
botanicals
smell
was
a
bit
lacking
to
me
though
present
would
recommend
this
beer
would
consider
this
as
an
introducer
into
beer
for
those
who
dont
drink
beer
often
or
at
all
especially
those
who
dont
like
beer
for
the
bitter
beer
taste
that
can
be
present
which
in
my
opinion
beer
has
a
lack
of
it
has
good
balance
smooth
wheat
and
carbonated
but
not
over
done
on
either
end
but
to
be
honest
i
expect
a
more
robust
flavor
out
of
my
white
ales
solid
but
overrated
in
some
ways
d
very
drinkable
and
clean
this
one
goes
down
good
and
goes
down
easily
great
session
beer
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
but
is
so
drinkable
complex
and
versatile
ill
be
drinking
this
year
round
in
short
very
refreshing
but
complex
beer
love
those
belgians
that
is
rapidly
turning
into
my
goto
brew
d
this
is
the
second
time
that
i
have
tried
this
beer
and
was
a
bit
reluctant
after
my
first
tasting
age
apparently
has
made
me
a
bit
mellower
as
i
was
delightfully
surprised
about
this
beer
and
it
will
fit
nicely
into
my
drinking
rotation
drinkability
very
drinkable
great
flavor
and
satisfying
consistency
d
real
easy
to
have
more
than
one
good
beer
not
my
fav
but
i
wouldnt
kick
many
blondes
out
of
bed
and
this
one
is
no
different
poured
from
the
tap
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dies
out
almost
immediately
leaving
no
lacing
smell
is
not
overwhelming
but
is
like
one
would
expect
from
a
witbier
coriander
and
cloves
with
a
hint
of
citrus
somewhat
weizen
like
the
taste
is
much
the
same
as
the
smell
sweet
with
spices
and
citrus
but
not
as
enjoyable
as
some
others
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
pretty
light
in
body
with
minimal
carbonation
overall
an
easily
drinkable
beer
but
not
an
overly
desirable
one
worth
trying
but
nothing
i
will
be
revisiting
anytime
soon
drinkablility
is
excellent
especially
on
a
hot
humid
day
low
abv
and
the
clean
dry
finish
leave
you
wanting
just
one
more
no
overpowering
flavors
to
get
cloying
after
several
just
a
refreshing
thirstquenching
brew
all
in
all
this
is
an
excellent
beer
excellent
head
taste
and
highly
drinkable
not
much
else
to
say
mouthfeel
is
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
a
light
bodied
beer
but
im
impressed
with
the
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
also
i
could
drink
these
all
day
without
ever
getting
tired
of
them
but
also
without
ever
having
an
excellent
beer
all
day
either
d
this
is
a
nice
and
drinkable
beer
that
i
think
few
would
find
offensive
or
difficult
it
doesnt
stand
out
to
me
as
something
to
search
out
but
i
can
see
this
working
well
with
hot
wings
recommended
by
others
or
a
salmon
blt
ive
got
a
warm
spot
for
this
brew
it
helped
me
through
my
year
when
i
didnt
have
access
to
craft
beer
in
korea
this
is
a
great
import
good
flavors
for
this
witbier
but
nothing
really
exceptional
about
it
this
beer
doesnt
really
have
anything
that
makes
it
stand
out
just
an
over
all
decent
beer
bottle
pours
a
straw
yellow
aroma
is
subdued
coriander
flavor
is
the
same
some
spices
come
out
that
arent
apparent
in
the
aroma
light
refreshing
goes
well
with
several
foods
from
a
great
steak
to
a
pizza
good
choice
after
a
round
of
golf
in
the
hot
sun
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
poured
into
a
pint
glass
cloudy
light
tan
color
i
like
the
look
of
this
nice
citrus
smell
citrus
taste
also
very
refreshing
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
easily
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
when
you
want
something
crisp
one
of
my
goto
beers
when
i
want
a
good
beer
out
somewhere
got
this
on
tap
at
the
yardhouse
in
san
diego
ca
was
served
with
a
thin
cotton
white
head
body
was
a
light
pale
yellow
looks
like
a
fresh
squeezed
lemonade
im
so
glad
they
didnt
put
a
stupid
orange
or
lemon
on
it
smells
were
sweet
lemony
citris
v8
type
vegetable
smells
taste
was
a
bit
like
banana
taffy
with
hints
of
clove
spice
flavors
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
of
tingle
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
a
light
dry
acidic
note
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
i
love
white
ales
so
i
might
be
a
little
bias
on
this
one
yellow
cloudy
body
with
with
a
thin
white
head
which
stays
with
the
beer
all
the
way
down
the
smell
is
not
particularly
stong
but
was
sweet
tastes
strongly
of
orange
with
some
lemon
too
goes
down
very
easily
and
would
make
for
a
perfect
beer
in
the
summer
time
d
yep
it
seems
like
i
see
it
more
outandabout
and
compared
with
the
other
stuff
this
is
the
choice
when
no
microbrewed
hefes
or
wits
are
available
appearance
is
hazed
light
straw
with
a
thick
crisp
head
smell
is
mainly
citrus
that
is
crisp
and
clean
taste
of
citrus
spice
and
wheat
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
makes
it
crisp
and
refreshing
seems
a
little
watered
down
with
the
overall
flavor
but
still
a
very
good
summer
brew
bottom
line
its
been
a
while
since
i
last
had
some
of
this
and
i
dont
recall
it
being
this
light
on
the
flavours
in
my
book
its
just
so
so
there
are
lots
of
others
in
the
style
that
please
my
palate
more
on
this
time
that
i
actually
looked
to
drink
in
order
to
review
it
i
was
more
apt
to
notice
that
i
really
didnt
enjoy
it
nearly
as
much
as
i
first
thought
the
smell
and
first
sip
are
on
the
top
of
any
list
but
i
think
the
drinkability
is
where
it
really
falls
apart
over
time
the
quintessential
witbier
maybe
not
what
it
once
was
from
what
people
say
but
still
a
classic
poured
white
into
a
hoegaarden
glass
like
seven
up
soft
drink
i
thought
at
first
light
honey
hue
in
the
glass
cloudy
murky
generously
carbonated
generous
fluffy
white
head
two
fingers
with
good
retention
smell
of
fruit
rind
citrus
taste
is
refreshingly
zesty
with
marmalade
a
touch
of
spice
lemon
lime
smooth
mouthfeel
with
fullness
and
a
very
satisfying
peach
finish
citrus
a
bit
of
sweet
apricot
too
overall
i
never
realized
just
how
pleasant
this
beer
is
until
i
sat
down
to
review
it
id
be
happy
to
have
another
right
now
hoegaarden
original
white
ale
pours
a
cloudy
light
yellow
white
with
a
frothy
head
that
lingers
in
the
glass
the
aroma
is
yeast
and
citrusy
corriander
with
a
hint
of
sweet
wheat
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
refreshing
very
slightly
tart
with
more
coriander
and
slightly
chalky
yeast
the
hops
are
all
but
nonexistent
and
the
beer
is
very
smooth
and
refreshing
pours
a
pale
whiteish
yellow
the
head
is
small
and
pure
white
the
smell
is
sort
of
lemony
taste
is
of
a
slight
belgian
style
yeast
with
a
bit
of
peppery
flavor
and
lemon
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
with
a
proper
level
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
smooth
and
light
taste
light
and
refreshing
with
a
nice
lemony
citrus
introduction
getting
stronger
on
the
midpalate
hints
of
coriander
and
a
light
balancing
malt
finishes
crisp
with
a
sort
of
biting
feeling
in
the
back
of
the
throat
overall
not
the
best
witbier
ive
had
to
date
but
still
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
even
if
its
not
the
original
celis
hoegaarden
recommended
one
of
the
best
anod
more
refreshing
beers
wonderful
as
an
aperitif
or
just
alone
in
hot
days
drinkability
hoegaarden
is
always
a
good
choice
in
a
witbier
i
have
noticed
that
many
beeradvocate
members
have
noticed
this
reduction
in
quality
and
i
feel
as
time
moves
on
and
all
the
older
batches
are
off
the
shelves
the
less
favorable
reviews
will
start
rolling
in
the
mean
time
youre
gambling
on
every
hoegaarden
you
pick
up
this
one
is
not
for
mewill
have
a
hard
time
trying
again
i
wanted
to
rate
this
beer
on
the
first
six
pack
but
liked
it
enough
that
i
drank
them
all
too
fast
and
had
to
buy
another
six
pack
on
a
different
day
in
order
to
remain
objective
during
my
review
thats
a
good
sign
by
me
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
30
2007
at
houstons
steak
and
ribs
in
toronto
the
beer
was
a
hazy
yellow
colour
with
a
very
white
head
that
persisted
throughout
the
experience
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
wheat
and
malt
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
carbonated
with
some
mediumbodiedness
the
flavour
was
wheaty
with
hints
of
malt
a
good
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
into
the
world
of
great
tasting
craft
beers
i
prefer
it
in
the
bottle
than
on
the
tap
all
and
all
one
of
my
favorites
beers
too
bad
its
not
generally
available
in
iowa
feels
dry
expected
drinks
good
yum
poured
into
a
pint
glass
wow
another
nice
rocky
wheat
beer
head
that
stuck
around
for
the
duration
the
label
mentions
coriander
and
orange
peel
which
are
definitely
noticeable
along
with
other
aromatics
which
im
not
sophisticated
enough
to
identify
very
enigmatic
color
not
even
translucent
easy
to
drink
reasonable
abv
definitely
sessionable
drinkability
while
i
vowed
i
wouldnt
drink
another
wit
beer
i
got
stuck
with
this
during
a
pairing
event
after
having
tasted
a
couple
of
american
versions
this
was
definitely
an
improvement
and
from
what
i
can
tell
a
good
example
of
this
beer
style
flavors
were
better
balanced
the
coriander
celery
flavor
didnt
dominate
like
the
american
version
ive
tasted
but
still
not
my
cup
of
tea
though
served
to
me
with
a
light
rim
of
head
that
did
not
go
anywhere
for
a
long
time
color
was
a
thick
deep
cloudy
yellow
smell
was
great
bananas
citrus
and
yeast
taste
did
not
dissapoint
pale
malts
very
little
hop
presence
and
sweet
flavors
of
orange
spice
and
maybe
even
some
banana
a
delicious
refreshing
witbier
served
to
me
quite
cold
which
was
refreshing
but
the
flavors
really
came
out
when
it
warmed
up
a
bit
little
carbonation
and
a
medium
body
quite
drinkable
a
full
beer
that
is
not
filling
d
one
of
my
favourite
alltime
wits
one
of
the
classics
immensely
drinkable
a
great
summer
or
brunch
beer
the
aroma
is
perfumey
with
an
instantly
enticing
spice
and
pepperiness
from
the
saaz
hops
hints
of
lemon
zest
and
orange
are
also
noticeable
the
palate
is
smooth
medium
bodied
with
a
mild
sparkling
sharpness
and
refreshing
bite
it
has
a
tart
citrusy
quality
to
the
flavor
with
a
peppery
spice
to
it
there
is
an
orange
and
a
mild
honey
taste
that
provides
a
smooth
relaxing
sweetness
theres
some
acidity
and
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
finish
nice
summer
brew
but
a
bit
too
sweet
and
watered
down
from
previous
years
this
doesnt
show
up
too
often
around
here
so
whenever
it
does
i
grab
it
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
it
and
maybe
i
had
too
high
expectations
it
poured
up
light
straw
colored
and
cloudy
with
a
thick
white
head
i
smelled
yeast
and
some
fruitiness
it
was
very
smooth
and
the
hops
were
a
nice
compliment
to
the
wheat
malt
and
spice
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
thin
but
otherwise
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
was
disappointed
i
had
somehow
expected
more
orange
in
the
flavor
compared
to
the
bottled
hoegaarden
my
draft
didnt
seem
quite
as
crisp
still
it
was
pretty
tasty
theres
a
big
sweet
creamy
flavor
with
notes
of
belgian
spice
and
lemon
i
kept
waiting
for
the
flavor
to
really
open
up
but
it
never
came
d
great
summer
brew
and
a
taste
that
hit
the
spot
i
kept
coming
back
for
more
would
keep
a
six
of
this
on
hand
quite
often
hoegaarden
was
my
favorite
wheat
beer
hands
down
and
my
favorite
session
beer
when
i
ran
into
it
at
the
a
national
grocery
store
i
was
very
glad
to
see
that
a
relatively
quality
import
and
the
original
witbier
was
enjoying
mass
market
appeal
i
have
found
that
sense
hoegaardens
growth
into
a
national
grocery
staple
the
beer
has
changed
the
last
several
six
packs
i
have
bought
were
not
completely
cloudy
as
they
should
and
clam
to
be
and
the
taste
seemed
to
be
watered
down
i
am
disappointed
did
hoegaarden
change
their
brewing
standards
for
us
exports
to
appeal
to
the
mass
market
and
compete
with
budweiser
corona
and
the
rest
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
thin
but
large
head
the
smell
is
rather
spicy
with
some
banana
and
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
belgian
spices
fruit
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
an
average
mouth
feel
quite
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
and
good
one
for
a
hot
afternoon
poured
cloudy
yellow
with
white
creamy
head
very
thin
mouthfeel
proper
amount
of
carbonation
notes
of
fruit
lemon
and
orange
and
also
spicy
pretty
good
beer
though
a
bit
on
the
expensive
side
nice
lacing
flavor
really
grows
on
you
good
beer
that
is
now
ubiquitous
its
a
decent
brew
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
even
worse
this
replaced
bully
porter
at
my
corner
bar
it
may
be
time
to
find
a
new
corner
bar
drinkability
something
about
the
taste
i
just
couldnt
get
into
but
by
no
means
is
this
a
bad
beer
not
much
of
a
wow
sitting
in
front
of
the
computer
but
damn
refreshing
at
a
summer
picnic
on
a
sweltering
day
great
beer
for
summertime
drinking
it
seems
to
go
naturally
with
outside
dining
or
patiodeck
bar
settings
good
classic
white
ale
with
citrus
notes
and
good
cloudy
straw
white
coloration
very
fresh
and
young
tasting
which
makes
it
drink
easily
a
classic
beer
that
can
be
savored
over
and
over
this
beer
was
pricey
but
since
i
love
white
ales
anyway
i
wanted
to
try
pours
a
nice
cloudy
strawwhite
color
with
a
thin
head
aroma
is
delicate
and
spicy
with
hints
of
banana
and
clove
taste
is
nice
and
tart
with
the
base
flavors
giving
way
to
a
citrusy
mouthfeel
with
clove
and
spice
pretty
well
balanced
for
a
white
beer
id
definitely
say
its
one
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
love
the
bottle
shape
too
a
beer
that
is
distinctively
different
and
epitomizes
its
style
in
textbook
fashion
do
i
find
hoegaarden
objectionable
no
would
i
buy
it
again
no
i
paid

and
id
much
rather
spend
that
much
on
a
4pack
of
duvel
or
a
couple
bombers
of
ommegang
d
overall
a
good
beer
that
stays
true
to
the
style
worth
a
try
poured
a
tall
creamy
brightwhite
head
that
never
seemed
to
fade
after
a
few
sips
of
the
hazy
hay
colored
beer
there
were
rings
of
lace
around
the
glass
bits
of
candied
oranges
flowers
and
coriander
in
the
aroma
the
light
flavor
os
wheat
is
accented
by
bits
of
citrus
fine
carbonation
and
crisp
clean
flavors
make
for
a
refreshing
beer
it
may
be
an
overly
commercialized
brand
but
the
beer
is
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
drink
with
ease
very
refreshing
with
good
but
not
overpowering
flavour
making
you
want
to
drink
more
this
is
a
really
refreshing
beer
and
it
goes
down
in
a
way
somewhat
similar
to
lemon
squash
and
certain
scrumpy
ciders
the
acetic
bite
is
far
more
noticeable
than
any
alcohol
taste
it
is
an
interesting
beer
and
i
will
continue
to
try
it
on
occassion
despite
the
relatively
high
price
this
beer
is
limp
and
watery
though
some
wheat
and
citrus
tones
come
through
it
comes
across
as
a
nonsyrupy
citrus
soda
drink
chalky
finish
and
weak
mouthfeel
i
guess
it
used
to
be
better

still
had
one
of
these
in
my
fridge
and
was
nearly
contemplating
tossing
it
but
decided
to
give
it
another
try
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
remembered
still
has
an
overall
sourness
to
it
that
would
really
not
make
me
desire
having
more
than
one
but
its
crispness
was
refreshing
smell
is
still
its
best
quality
imo
enjoy
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
bottle
and
would
definately
drink
it
again
as
it
came
in
a
750ml
bottle
then
this
was
a
good
amount
one
was
enough
on
a
weeknight
highly
recommended
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
a
nice
opaque
golden
body
with
a
small
white
head
no
real
retention
worth
noting
but
it
slowed
to
a
nice
lacing
the
smell
with
sweet
and
fruitty
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
very
smooth
with
banana
esters
very
present
in
the
taste
and
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
decent
at
best
a
little
on
the
thin
side
overall
a
nice
smooth
refreshing
beer
the
fact
that
it
is
easy
going
makes
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
pours
into
a
hoegaarden
glass
with
a
cloudy
lemony
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
on
top
it
has
the
aroma
of
citrus
and
a
sweet
malt
it
tastes
just
like
it
looks
a
bit
sweet
with
fruity
notes
and
refreshing
i
heard
that
this
should
go
down
in
three
sips
with
i
can
understand
why
a
good
summery
beer
this
is
a
very
drinkable
white
and
getting
to
be
very
available
on
tap
here
in
the
ne
d
very
drinkable
especially
in
the
summer
thick
foamy
head
on
a
soft
pour
pale
cloudy
strawcolored
with
fairly
vigorous
signs
of
carbonation
smell
is
mildly
sweet
with
corriander
and
a
mild
citrus
note
taste
is
spicy
and
citrus
typical
of
style
but
somewhat
muted
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
biting
due
to
the
high
carbonation
good
body
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
but
there
are
other
beers
that
better
exemplify
this
style
still
very
enjoyable
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
d
incredibly
drinkable
not
strong
or
complex
but
very
good
and
very
refreshing
not
a
huge
wheat
fan
but
this
one
was
a
very
easy
drinking
somewhat
but
not
overly
sweet
ale
hazy
orange
inviting
color
with
a
white
head
that
went
away
quickly
but
hung
on
to
the
glass
till
the
last
drop
sweet
fruity
aroma
as
well
as
the
taste
i
could
drink
this
one
all
summer
long
as
long
as
it
is
a
nice
hot
day
light
overall
flavor
good
for
summertime
thirstquenching
not
my
favorite
witbier
had
this
one
a
couple
of
times
ontap
lately
seems
to
be
the
good
beer
that
sneaks
in
the
crappy
beer
joints
the
look
is
excellent
nice
strawyellow
color
opaque
and
hazy
with
a
nice
twofinger
white
head
on
top
nose
is
fairly
mild
mostly
citrus
but
not
a
lot
there
taste
is
better
this
one
kind
of
sets
the
standard
for
the
style
in
my
mind
coriander
yeast
and
citrus
floats
around
all
over
the
place
a
little
hops
in
the
back
but
mostly
a
wheatbeerlike
taste
feel
is
a
little
thin
although
that
does
seem
to
be
kind
of
standard
for
the
style
a
solid
beer
definitely
one
i
could
make
sessionable
if
you
havent
had
this
one
yet
check
it
out
overall
this
is
an
excellent
belgian
white
one
of
the
classics
its
quite
nice
on
a
warm
or
hot
day
very
refreshing
and
tasty
the
last
half
i
enjoyed
with
a
small
quarter
slice
of
orange
as
is
traditional
in
belgium
very
nice
heard
lots
of
good
things
about
this
beer
of
course
like
alot
of
the
beers
i
hear
about
i
have
to
go
over
to
missouri
to
get
regardless
has
a
nice
color
to
it
with
some
cloudiness
smells
like
spicy
hops
with
citrus
notes
tastes
great
more
citrus
flavor
is
evident
as
is
more
spicy
hops
refreshing
tasty
beer
wish
i
could
get
it
more
often
really
great
example
of
a
great
style
looks
great
in
the
glass
big
pillowy
head
tons
of
bubbles
kind
of
a
cloudy
straw
in
color
the
nose
is
really
subtle
a
little
too
subtle
maybe
for
me
picking
up
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
nice
delicate
not
over
powering
subtle
clove
and
spice
notes
maybe
a
little
too
laid
back
but
extremely
drinkable
not
sure
if
its
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
definitly
one
of
the
more
drinkable
ones
md
creamytextured
on
the
palate
also
slightly
tangy
due
to
the
wheatiness
and
yeasts
but
this
really
is
not
my
favourite
style
as
the
flavour
tends
to
disintegrate
after
several
sips
as
well
as
after
warming
up
not
a
bad
beer
though
dont
get
me
wrong
had
this
at
a
nowdefunct
french
bistro
and
thankfully
out
of
the
two
two
taps
this
was
one
of
the
beers
available
served
in
a
hoegaarden
glass
kinda
small
glass
this
was
pale
yellow
and
so
cloudy
it
seemed
whitish
to
me
big
snow
white
head
bouqet
was
subtle
but
i
detected
clove
or
coriander
white
breadbiscuits
and
even
bubblegum
yeasty
aromas
taste
is
of
lightly
sweet
malt
balanced
by
a
creamy
carbonation
and
almost
indiscernable
floral
hop
background
somehow
manages
to
finish
clean
light
bodied
and
creamy
i
had
a
few
of
these
no
problem
overall
this
is
a
staple
in
my
line
of
beers
i
have
gone
back
many
times
since
my
first
and
love
this
brew
a
must
try
hell
try
it
twice
in
one
of
thier
giant
bucket
sized
glasses
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
poured
23
into
a
pint
glass
swirled
the
bottle
and
poured
the
remaining
13
in
as
the
bottle
instructs
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
frothy
2
finger
head
decent
longevity
and
very
nice
lace
smells
as
a
witbier
should
lots
of
citruslemon
with
a
slight
peppery
aroma
mixed
with
a
tad
of
banana
and
some
yeast
aromas
upon
tasting
it
is
light
in
flavor
although
all
of
the
correct
flavors
are
present
with
a
nice
and
lite
sourness
this
beer
is
lite
and
refreshing
very
refreshing
perhaps
a
bit
lite
in
the
flavor
stregth
but
a
very
nice
summer
beer
indeed
drinkabilty
is
good
though
it
might
be
a
tad
sweet
not
a
bad
option
i
ended
up
having
two
before
switching
to
duvel
and
chimay
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
very
flavorful
one
of
the
more
reviewed
beers
on
ba
and
rightfully
deserved
of
its
placement
and
grade
this
is
one
that
i
will
definatley
look
for
in
the
future
d
this
could
be
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
which
it
is
by
no
means
here
in
michigan
right
now
ill
have
to
give
this
another
shot
when
its
above
freezing
outside
slammin
some
hos
ahh
that
never
gets
old
interesting
beer
it
pours
white
with
a
good
amount
of
head
as
the
bottle
tells
you
to
pour
23rds
swirl
and
then
pour
the
rest
theres
a
lil
bit
of
something
floating
around
in
here
yeast
the
smell
is
quite
pleasant
like
a
mellow
version
of
franziskaner
id
say
the
taste
is
like
the
forementioned
and
i
could
pound
these
all
night
if
it
was
going
to
be
one
of
those
nights
because
its
just
a
great
beer
to
session
with
not
very
filling
light
and
has
the
hefe
feel
to
it
which
i
love
btw
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
hey
its
a
light
beer
for
drinkability
again
one
of
the
beers
that
could
probably
never
offend
me
good
job
this
is
what
a
light
beer
should
be
a
bit
pricey
though
this
beer
has
taken
me
off
guard
and
i
am
very
pleased
with
my
purchase
the
taste
is
natural
and
mild
when
compared
to
a
blue
moon
and
i
would
recommend
this
over
a
blue
moon
any
time
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
brisk
carbonation
this
is
a
classic
style
example
and
a
good
beer
overall
this
was
a
fine
example
of
the
style
and
i
think
i
will
be
drinking
much
more
of
this
beer
during
the
summer
months
particular
to
having
this
on
draft
i
think
it
loses
some
of
its
characteristic
flavors
when
served
from
a
keg
this
has
a
tendency
to
strip
bottle
conditioned
wheat
beers
of
taste
as
it
is
essentially
decanting
the
yeast
sediment
without
allowing
it
to
really
get
at
the
beer
i
think
of
hoegaarden
other
witwheat
beers
as
being
filtered
when
on
tap
of
those
spices
its
simple
yet
appetising
and
refreshing
one
of
the
more
accessible
craft
beers
in
america
these
days
and
its
pretty
good
given
that
fact
when
just
enjoying
a
couple
of
beers
though
i
would
prefer
something
a
little
bit
more
foody
and
full
flavored
drinkability
light
nonoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
d
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
smooth
flavor
creamy
texture

a
good
witbier
worth
trying
if
you
are
interested
in
the
style
curing
common
beer
disease
had
this
ontap
at
the
local
earls
big
assed
24oz
pint
glass
beer
was
quite
cold
which
may
have
affected
any
head
retention
faint
aroma
but
did
detect
some
floralness
taste
was
quite
nice
muted
fruitpeachpear
and
a
hint
of
citrus
smooth
and
slightly
chewy
mouthfeel
would
be
a
nice
summer
beer
on
earls
patio
d
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
it
has
a
very
pleasant
and
unique
taste
this
is
my
first
witbier
but
based
on
this
beer
it
is
a
style
that
id
like
to
explore
further
drinkability
was
very
good
overall
this
beer
was
nice
and
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
poured
from
a
bottle
its
a
pale
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
is
a
bit
spicy
and
floral
with
a
touch
of
citrus
on
the
palate
its
just
as
spicy
as
youd
expect
from
the
aroma
mixed
with
sweet
wheat
flavor
and
again
a
bit
of
citrus
behind
the
coriander
with
a
very
slight
hop
flavor
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
somewhat
thin
which
is
uncharacteristic
of
how
filling
it
is
altogether
its
a
drinkable
brew
though
spiciness
is
what
i
look
for
in
my
whiskies
rather
than
my
beers
but
it
is
oddly
filling
not
unlike
a
good
stout
d
a
very
nice
beer
one
that
i
could
drink
on
a
regular
basis
this
will
find
its
way
back
into
my
fridge
very
good
moderately
sessionable
beer
hoegaarden
simply
is
what
it
is
a
architype
for
the
witbier
style
its
not
designed
to
wow
the
taste
buds
but
the
flavors
are
far
from
offensive
enough
tartness
to
keep
the
beer
from
being
bland
and
given
the
right
conditions
the
beer
can
be
quite
refreshing
this
is
one
beer
i
prefer
on
the
colder
side
of
the
spectrum
as
i
feel
it
makes
it
a
bit
more
tight
and
impactfull
this
is
a
nice
summer
drink
i
do
enjoy
wit
beers
and
this
is
a
good
one
but
i
find
the
allagash
and
hitachino
white
more
flavorful
however
they
are
more
expensive
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
its
light
and
goes
down
easy
entering
this
from
notes
drank
a
large
bottle
of
this
by
myself
in
england
pours
a
hazy
straw
color
small
white
head
decent
retention
smells
of
sharp
bread
and
yeast
some
wheat
citrus
like
oranges
tastes
much
of
the
same
fine
example
of
a
witbier
or
white
ale
very
spicy
and
yeasty
medium
mouthfeel
very
easily
drinkable
beer
drinkability
nice
summer
beer
you
have
to
try
this
if
you
never
tried
a
witbier
style
beer
one
of
the
top
witbier
beers
great
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
makes
this
one
very
easy
to
quaff
the
low
alcohol
percentage
doesnt
hurt
either
great
session
beer
this
beer
is
an
absolute
staple
not
my
favorite
witte
but
damned
good
and
easy
to
find
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
very
filling
at
all
nice
representation
of
style
i
was
at
the
restaurant
for
only
about
an
hour
and
put
away
3
pints
the
only
thing
that
would
keep
me
from
sticking
with
this
beer
for
an
evening
would
be
that
i
might
drink
it
too
quickly
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
fades
down
considerably
not
too
much
going
on
in
the
nose
some
spicy
citrus
notes
and
some
mild
floral
hops
its
pleasant
though
smooth
taste
of
citrus
clove
spice
and
rounded
out
with
a
slightly
bready
hop
bite
overall
very
drinkable
and
light
perfect
for
summer
can
be
served
with
an
orange
or
lemon
to
intensify
the
citrus
elements
adding
a
slice
of
lemon
to
the
glass
only
enhances
the
flavor
imo
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
has
a
great
light
orangeyellow
color
but
with
minimal
head
it
smells
like
your
typical
unfiltered
wheat
beer
tasty
the
taste
is
excellent
although
i
am
a
bit
biased
because
i
really
enjoy
this
style
i
served
it
with
a
slice
of
lemon
orange
is
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
it
has
a
plain
mouthfeel
but
it
is
smooth
and
delectable
i
highly
recommend
to
fans
of
this
style
michael
as
the
name
suggests
is
bears
a
distinct
wheat
smell
and
taste
it
tastes
sharp
with
hints
of
citrus
slightly
overcarbonated
for
my
liking
its
very
smooth
and
quite
tasty
i
could
happily
drink
this
all
night
esspecially
considering
its
now
very
reasonable
price
here
in
australia
great
cloudy
golden
pour
good
yeasty
aromas
with
tangy
citrus
bite
wheaty
on
the
tongue
light
airy
head
gives
flavors
a
way
to
come
through
belgian
yeast
strains
are
god
and
this
is
a
great
mild
intro
to
the
style
extremely
drinkable
and
the
aggressive
carbonation
makes
this
brew
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
drinkability
very
smooth
and
tasty
i
could
drink
many
at
a
time
i
can
knock
back
more
of
these
than
id
like
to
admit
and
while
its
not
my
favorite
all
time
wit
hoegaarden
original
white
ale
is
a
definite
contender
in
the
wide
world
of
witbier
eric
the
pour
is
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lace
the
aroma
is
peppery
coupled
with
the
sweet
notes
of
orange
and
lemon
zest
quite
nice
actually
flavors
start
out
sweet
with
noticeable
wheat
flavors
of
course
there
is
a
presence
of
coriander
that
is
interested
and
might
catch
you
a
little
off
guard
with
the
first
few
sips
the
finish
is
a
bit
flat
and
watery
in
my
opinion
mouthfeel
is
lightly
chewy
drinkability
is
average
better
if
your
a
devote
follower
of
the
white
ales
overall
i
must
say
that
is
brew
did
not
impress
me
with
the
first
glass
it
might
have
been
the
present
mood
affecting
my
objectivity
however
by
the
end
of
the
session
i
did
find
it
and
enjoyable
brew
best
to
buy
and
try
for
yourself
a
33cl
bottle
with
a
best
by
4208
date
it
was
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
small
head
aroma
was
citrus
as
well
as
a
grassy
smell
i
couldnt
really
appreciate
the
citrus
when
tasting
it
mostly
some
spiciness
i
thought
this
was
a
little
too
bland
even
for
a
wit
could
be
a
decent
thirst
quencher
i
think
a
part
of
me
expected
a
better
beer
and
a
part
of
me
wanted
to
hate
this
beer
and
a
part
of
me
got
the
exact
beer
i
was
expecting
i
am
happy
this
beer
is
good
it
is
the
best
affordable
wit
available
in
omaha
it
kills
zôn
sunshine
wheat
and
blue
moon
but
blanche
de
chambly
and
st
bernardus
wit
are
much
better
but
pricier
im
please
it
is
available
in
omaha
i
found
it
to
be
a
drinkable
and
likeable
wit
worth
a
try
goes
down
easy
with
enough
flavor
to
want
more
although
i
was
thinking
more
in
terms
of
food
pairings
than
multiple
glasses
on
tap
in
europe
d
very
high
delicious
refreshing
quite
nice
drinkability
very
drinkable
refreshing
even
light
beer
drinkers
would
enjoy
this
one
but
this
has
a
lot
more
character
pours
a
light
pale
orange
not
watery
but
white
thus
the
style
of
the
ale
nice
white
head
not
much
lacing
if
any
lemony
orange
smell
coriander
taste
of
lemon
zest
a
bit
of
orange
banana
coriander
moderately
carbonated
a
bit
creamy
finishes
quite
dry
not
my
favorite
style
always
thought
it
had
some
funk
flavor
but
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
in
my
earlier
years
good
drinkability
a
bit
dry
for
my
liking
but
that
is
ok
since
it
is
not
bitter
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
classic
drinkability
very
good
year
round
refreshing
in
the
summer
and
a
daily
sipper
during
the
winter
unfortunately
my
every
day
sippers
come
from
kegs
that
i
buy
from
local
craft
brewers
this
is
a
great
beer
to
have
if
you
go
out
to
a
place
that
might
not
have
the
best
beer
selection
slainte
d
very
drinkable
solid
easy
to
find
wit
taste
is
very
mild
with
suttle
hints
of
bananna
and
wheat
but
very
limited
not
a
very
tasteful
beer
and
kind
mild
on
the
pallette
still
enjoyable
once
in
a
while
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
the
taste
is
almost
like
the
smell
but
seems
more
muted
banana
and
spices
a
bit
of
hops
its
not
an
overwhelming
flavor
nor
very
interesting
not
offensive
by
any
means
a
fairly
typical
wit
certainly
not
bad
but
nothing
special
either
this
is
my
favorite
kind
of
beer
light
and
nice
without
being
pointless
no
unpleasant
overtones
of
alcohol
not
too
fizzy
the
yeasty
taste
really
is
this
beers
forte
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
it
was
so
mild
my
wife
even
liked
it
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
kick
in
the
taste
buds
overall
a
highly
drinkable
wit
well
worth
the
reputation
ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
because
the
only
witbiers
ive
had
are
blue
moon
and
hitachino
nest
this
one
seems
similar
to
a
blue
moon
only
better
nice
color
very
pale
golden
good
head
tastes
of
banana
citrus
and
pear
it
seems
near
the
end
of
the
glass
i
noticed
a
more
spicy
flavor
coriander
was
more
prominent
than
other
beers
also
compared
to
blue
moon
the
mouthfeel
seemed
more
full
more
substance
overall
it
was
a
nice
light
satisfying
beer
if
you
like
blue
moon
definitely
try
this
one
out
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
sunshine
yellow
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
the
aroma
is
all
citrus
the
flavor
is
citrusy
but
not
overwhelming
orange
like
blue
moon
i
can
taste
the
corriandor
knowing
that
its
there
its
very
subtle
the
mouthfeel
is
good
mediumlight
without
seeming
to
watery
an
overall
good
beer
that
is
almost
always
in
my
fridge
pours
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
three
finger
white
head
which
fades
fairly
quickly
you
can
definitely
smell
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
or
grapefruit
would
fit
tastes
same
mouthfeel
light
just
right
carbonation
a
little
bitter
citrus
at
the
end
drank
five
of
these
for
the
review
and
really
enjoyed
it
the
appearance
is
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
perhaps
a
one
finger
creamy
head
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
is
sweet
and
citrusy
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
spice
and
lemon
are
most
evident
minimal
hop
bitterness
it
is
both
sweet
and
sour
like
lemonade
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
mild
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
tried
this
in
november
but
i
bet
it
goes
down
even
easier
in
the
summer
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
can
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
not
an
everyday
beer
for
me
but
one
that
ill
have
again
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
hazy
blonde
head
is
much
bigger
creamy
with
good
retention
and
lacing
which
lines
the
glass
highly
aromatic
as
in
the
bottle
with
citrus
coriander
and
clove
on
palate
sweet
and
sour
with
clove
and
banana
on
finish
perhaps
more
intensity
of
flavour
than
in
the
bottle
the
lovely
sweetsour
finish
is
lasting
carbonation
is
more
balanced
on
tap
creating
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
few
beers
could
be
called
more
refreshing
superbly
drinkable
particularly
now
that
the
weather
is
getting
warmer
in
australia
in
spite
of
a
good
selection
of
other
beers
where
i
was
drinking
i
couldnt
resist
sticking
with
this
hoegaarden
original
white
ale
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
it
has
a
nice
aroma
citrus
and
coriander
are
both
noticeable
lemon
and
orange
are
most
noticeable
in
the
flavor
with
coriander
lurking
in
the
background
theres
some
grain
and
wheat
at
the
end
very
drinkable
a
summers
day
drink
not
for
winter
nights
this
is
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
highly
recommend
however
i
wont
be
drinking
a
whole
bunch
of
it
in
large
quantities
it
seems
a
bit
heavier
than
other
beers
ive
had
hoegaarden
pronounced
whogarden
is
one
of
the
worlds
best
examples
of
a
belgian
wit
or
white
style
it
is
a
light
crisp
beer
containing
barley
and
wheat
and
spiced
with
coriander
and
curacao
orange
peel
it
is
produced
by
brouwerij
van
hoegaarden
in
hoegaarden
belgium
for
inbev
the
brewery
includes
oats
in
the
beer
which
along
with
secondary
fermentation
in
the
bottle
results
in
a
thick
white
creamy
head
the
yeast
causes
some
slight
cloudiness
but
does
not
take
away
from
the
flavor
it
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
on
tap
in
5
liter
glass
poured
pretty
clear
for
an
unfiltered
wheat
beer
with
a
solid
head
that
stuck
around
till
the
last
aroma
of
lemon
and
wheat
and
some
aspects
of
cloves
but
no
banana
flavor
initial
taste
was
lightly
bitter
with
a
light
palate
lacking
in
overall
mouth
feel
due
to
too
cold
a
pour
drink
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
first
beers
that
opened
my
eyes
to
the
real
world
of
beers
this
was
the
one
that
started
it
for
me
d
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
had
this
is
at
least
my
tenth
bottle
of
hoegaarden
but
i
never
reviewed
it
until
now
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
especially
those
who
want
a
stepping
stone
from
the
macros
to
something
better
one
of
my
favourite
brews
and
i
will
definately
drink
it
consistently
for
years
to
come
honest
to
goodness
one
of
my
favorites
i
just
love
this
beer
only
the
second
witbier
ive
tried
and
im
quite
impressed
when
poured
from
a
bottle
to
a
pint
glass
this
beer
has
a
nice
yellowish
cloudy
color
with
a
decent
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
it
smells
of
citrus
and
spice
the
taste
is
well
balanced
with
the
spice
on
the
back
not
too
overwhelming
for
the
fruity
front
in
the
mouth
it
has
a
light
smooth
quality
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
really
dont
think
i
can
give
this
beer
justice
with
my
words
but
needless
to
say
i
hope
to
have
it
again
very
soon
and
since
i
dont
think
this
is
sold
in
too
many
places
near
me
it
has
forced
me
to
branch
out
and
try
as
many
wheat
beers
as
possible
pours
great
with
a
thick
foamy
head
and
a
great
cloudy
appearance
i
also
find
this
beer
highly
drinkable
but
i
think
its
a
little
lacking
in
complexity
its
a
little
too
peppery
for
me
as
well
its
not
bad
for
a
session
beer
because
its
light
and
drinkable
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
light
yellow
slightly
murky
body
with
a
nearly
white
head
about
4
fingers
thick
smells
citrusy
mostly
with
some
spice
very
wellbalanced
and
tasty
sweet
citrusy
with
some
spice
but
no
flavor
overpowers
virtually
perfect
extremely
drinkable
im
very
impressed
the
best
witbier
ive
tried
and
a
new
favorite
d
the
light
feel
paired
with
a
creamyfruity
taste
adds
up
to
a
very
drinkable
witbier
the
ultimate
hotsummersday
selection
poured
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
the
smell
was
fruity
banana
and
citrusy
albiet
not
overwhelmingly
strong
the
taste
is
enjoyable
consisting
of
some
sweet
malt
a
citrusy
hop
flavour
and
some
wheaty
sourness
there
is
also
an
overall
spiceyness
which
complements
the
individual
characteristics
hoegaarden
is
exceptional
in
its
mouthfeel
as
far
as
im
concerned
this
beer
is
crisp
and
highly
refreshing
and
has
a
lightmedium
body
i
also
think
drinkability
is
high
especially
in
hot
weather
this
was
the
first
wit
i
ever
had
many
years
back
and
even
though
ive
had
a
few
which
surpass
it
ill
always
hold
this
as
a
benchmark
for
the
style
beautiful
cloudy
topazyellow
color
coriander
and
banana
nose
is
nice
but
a
bit
weak
mouthfeel
is
excellent
citrus
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
clove
taste
is
refreshing
light
and
easyglidesmooth
but
like
an
overanxious
adolescent
it
finishes
too
quick
this
is
an
excellent
summer
drink
in
fact
its
very
much
like
a
summer
fling
fresh
invigorating
effervescent
but
ultimately
not
transcendent
d
you
could
drink
this
all
night
so
could
i
so
this
is
what
blue
moon
was
trying
to
copy
slightly
fizzy
feel
on
the
way
down
but
i
could
drink
these
all
day
though
its
so
mild
that
i
might
need
to
have
something
strong
to
mix
it
up
also
a
very
good
initiation
beer
to
those
not
so
inclined
toward
malt
and
hops
this
is
a
very
different
beer
from
the
main
stream
beers
you
find
in
america
it
is
even
markedly
different
from
any
macro
i
have
tasted
it
is
white
slightly
golden
with
descent
head
it
has
a
smokey
taste
to
it
thats
all
i
can
describe
it
as
it
is
definetly
different
from
any
other
beer
i
have
tried
this
one
is
highly
carbonated
thin
in
the
mouth
and
very
thirst
quenching
i
would
get
a
pint
of
this
again
especially
in
the
spring
or
summer
had
to
pick
up
a
case
of
this
finding
myself
more
of
an
afficianado
of
imports
and
less
of
a
hard
core
ipa
freak
surely
the
one
beer
to
have
when
youre
having
more
than
on
giving
this
a
late
review
as
the
case
is
almost
gone
but
after
having
heavier
brews
drinkable
as
they
were
there
is
no
problem
savoring
a
hoegaarden
as
the
night
comes
to
a
close
all
in
alla
very
nice
brew
gives
me
a
tart
tingle
in
the
lips
tongue
good
body
very
refreshing
and
not
bitter
great
witbier
pours
a
very
cloudy
dull
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
shrinks
down
to
a
covering
on
the
glass
strong
and
pleasant
wheat
aroma
taste
is
great
wheat
and
citrus
lemon
very
crisp
absolutely
delicious
the
taste
is
strong
but
the
beer
seems
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
rich
very
drinkable
an
excellent
wit
its
drinkable
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
one
that
i
think
is
much
better
on
tap
than
in
the
bottle
pours
a
hazy
ultra
pale
yellow
large
frothy
white
head
smell
is
of
light
fruit
notes
and
coriander
taste
is
light
on
the
palate
with
small
fruit
underlays
as
well
as
semitart
sourness
not
complex
but
easy
to
drink
especially
on
a
hot
day
mouthfeel
is
semicreamy
and
drinkability
is
good
final
statement
this
beer
is
refreshing
if
you
want
it
to
be
perhaps
not
as
enjoyable
to
the
novice
beer
drinker
however
i
know
quite
a
few
people
that
instantly
take
a
liking
to
it
adam
this
excellent
witbier
was
purchased
as
a
sixpack
of
those
evil
30
cl
bottles
bb
310507
i
used
the
special
hexagonal
hoegaarden
glass
to
really
appreciate
this
brew
directly
from
the
fridge
after
pouring
there
was
almost
no
head
what
little
did
form
slowly
disappeared
pale
misty
yellow
some
small
bubbles
rising
very
little
smell
some
sweets
and
err
banana
the
taste
was
well
balanced
fresh
sourness
combined
with
a
light
sweet
yeasty
flavor
a
hint
of
bitterness
which
lingered
long
after
the
other
tastes
had
gone
this
is
a
great
beer
to
be
had
when
thirsty
but
do
try
to
sip
it
slowly
so
it
can
be
fully
enjoyed
btw
abv
was
4
9
according
to
the
bottle
maybe
not
the
absolute
best
witbier
out
there
but
certainly
very
good
and
easy
to
like
d
very
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
there
are
some
witbiers
that
are
better
but
not
many
d
i
could
personally
put
away
one
of
those
5
liter
party
kegs
fassdosen
partydosen
if
i
knew
where
to
find
one
that
might
unfortunatley
only
be
a
germandutch
phenom
easy
enough
to
say
the
drinkabilty
is
very
high
on
this
beer
very
pricey
beer
but
well
worth
it
one
of
the
best
belgian
beers
ive
had
possible
the
entire
lower
counties
a
great
introduction
to
the
white
beer
style
d
very
i
love
this
beer
inbev
or
no
inbev
its
crisp
its
flavorful
its
balanced
and
its
really
tasty
this
will
always
be
a
quintessential
summer
refresher
for
me
drinking
one
during
the
winter
just
isnt
the
same
i
just
poured
my
last
bottle
for
the
summer
i
think
and
ill
admit
to
being
a
little
saddened
by
that
but
there
are
pumkin
ales
and
oktoberfests
in
stores
soon
or
now
so
that
may
not
last

with

was
very
strongly
spiced

and
the

malt
some
underpinning

rind
lots
of

is
crisp
and
light
very
tasty
very
drinkable
one
of
my
old
standbys
for
summer
a
classic
example
of
the
style
had
this
beer
on
tap
before
a
late
lunch
i
love
that
you
cant
see
through
it
in
the
glass
a
muted
yellowish
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
unfortunately
was
garnished
with
an
orange
the
smell
was
floral
and
grassy
the
taste
was
wellbalanced
just
slightly
sweet
and
so
very
smooth
this
beer
tastes
good
from
the
tip
of
your
tongue
to
the
back
as
the
flavor
changes
slightly
from
front
to
back
very
easy
to
drink
another
refreshing
summer
brew
this
beer
is
a
great
thing
to
experience
great
for
a
hot
day
or
when
you
just
want
to
relax
i
am
very
impressed
an
excellent
beer
i
think
that
i
like
the
blanche
de
chambly
just
a
little
more
but
this
was
a
worth
opponent
and
i
would
certainly
dirnk
more
of
these
extremely
drinkable
brew
and
hightly
recommended
this
is
a
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
brew
perfect
for
a
hot
summers
evening
when
wants
to
quench
their
thirst
cool
down
and
have
an
interesting
brew
ill
drink
it
again
sometime
for
sure
definitely
a
nicer
beer
goes
down
smooth
finishes
clean
you
can
line
these
up
one
after
another
overall
a
delicious
brew
in
general
i
prefer
belgian
wits
to
german
hefes
cliche
though
it
may
be
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
surely
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
the
style
out
there
you
have
to
try
this
one
im
very
new
at
this
but
i
feel
that
i
am
finally
developing
my
taste
and
this
site
is
a
great
help
i
tried
this
beer
at
the
winking
lizard
in
canton
ohio
because
it
was
the
beer
of
the
month
and
you
get
to
keep
the
huge
glass
can
always
use
more
glassware
the
beer
came
with
a
really
nice
white
frothy
head
and
the
liquid
was
a
nice
cloudy
yellowish
gold
the
head
stuck
around
for
quite
a
while
and
the
lacing
really
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
first
mouthfull
is
really
interesting
it
hits
you
with
a
fresh
zesty
citrus
hit
and
goes
down
really
smooth
i
hope
i
am
describing
this
right
but
my
friend
and
i
both
thought
that
the
aftertaste
was
very
much
like
clove
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
went
well
with
the
popcorn
and
loaded
nachos
i
know
not
the
most
sophisticated
accompaniment
and
it
really
hit
the
spot
on
a
hot
humid
day
i
would
definately
order
this
again
this
is
rapidly
becoming
my
favorite
belgian
witbier
aroma
is
really
great
lots
of
citrus
lemon
pepper
and
banana
and
orange
cloudy
golden
apearance
with
a
thin
head
taste
is
light
dry
crisp
and
thirst
quenching
and
with
not
as
much
malt
or
breadeness
this
is
exactly
what
i
like
about
witbiers
vs
hefeweizens
ultimately
though
what
can
you
really
say
about
hoegaarden
downhill
or
not
its
still
the
original
and
its
still
a
very
tasty
very
delicious
brew
and
an
excellent
accessible
introduction
into
a
world
of
beer
that
most
havent
evne
begun
to
explore
an
all
round
good
beer
i
liked
it
but
not
as
much
as
a
few
of
my
friends
did
nice
cloudy
pour
head
builds
and
reduces
ather
quickly
good
carbonation
tasted
a
little
citric
this
was
my
first
witbier
im
supprised
by
the
big
difference
from
hefes
still
the
simalities
outweighed
the
diiferences
a
nice
refreshing
lighter
beer
with
a
crisp
and
fruityspicey
taste
was
what
i
was
expecting
looking
forward
to
trying
it
on
tap
got
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
bier
markt
in
cleveland
nice
cloudy
appearance
with
ok
head
and
lacing
good
appearance
for
a
wheat
very
nice
lemon
scent
to
the
beer
with
and
excellent
citrus
and
wheat
taste
beer
went
down
crisp
and
smooth
excellent
summer
drink
d
the
original
what
can
you
say
a
good
one
if
youre
at
a
bar
and
are
looking
for
a
wit
by
the
way
this
goes
great
with
spicey
food
this
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
and
is
very
refreshing
the
carbonation
does
not
get
in
the
way
of
the
complex
flavor
of
this
beer
it
finishes
dry
and
in
my
opinion
there
isnt
anything
that
can
beat
hoegaarden
or
any
other
wheat
beer
on
a
hot
day
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
definitely
be
coming
back
to
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
very
refreshing
quite
light
and
refreshing
especially
today
because
it
was
hot
as
hell
when
youre
looking
for
something
to
cool
off
with
hoegaarden
is
hard
to
turn
down
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
make
you
feel
good
because
it
takes
some
of
the
heat
off
of
you
a
perfect
choice
for
summer
extremely
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
a
very
smooth
drinker
tastes
great
start
to
finish
quite

this
beer
is
very

highly
sessionable

beer
excellent
choice
for
the

great
summer
beer
goes
down
easy
and
is
not
a
heavy
beer
so
it
is
very
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
one
smooth
brew
very
tasty
and
easy
to

it
doesnt

a

to

fairly
priced
overall
a
very
good

good
n
refreshing
on
hot

recommended
they
keep
trying
to
replicate
this

and
they

reasonably
priced
in
ohio
great
summer
ale
drinking
hoegaarden
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
in
europe
is
just
about
a
requisite
life
experience
ahhhh
takes
me
back
ive
never
had
a
white
ale
before
so
this
was
something
new
i
was
quite
impressed
i
like
the
look
and
the
flavor
but
im
not
sure
how
likely
it
would
be
for
me
to
get
this
again
something
about
its
lookfeeltaste
make
it
seem
a
bit
like
a
novelty
would
have
this
again
with
friends
who
like
to
try
new
and
unique
beers
for
sure
but
on
my
own
i
think
id
get
a
hefeweizen
instead
but
definitely
something
to
be
checked
out
overall
i
assume
that
hoegaarden
represents
one
of
the
better
witbiers
out
there
as
such
i
must
admit
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
cloudy
beer
beneath
an
anemic
head
with
weak
spicy
taste
and
a
watery
feel
just
dont
float
my
boat
if
anyone
is
aware
of
a
truly
great
witbier
i
should
try
please
let
me
know
zingy
with
with
light
body
and
balanced
taste
could
have
a
few
especially
in
the
heat
of
the
d
c
summer
this
brew
reminds
me
a
bit
of
berliner
weisse
something
i
can
hardly
drink
in
a
pure
state
with
a
dominant
citric
acidity
and
sourness
however
it
has
some
additional
spices
coriander
and
peppery
taste
no
doubt
a
great
thirst
quencher
but
if
the
choice
was
mine
id
go
for
an
ipa
one
of
the
best
witbiers
around
hazy
washedout
gold
with
a
pristine
thin
white
head
white
pepper
scent

maltysour
wheat
and

mash
a

too
chewy
sprouted
wheat
with
pepper
and
cilantro
leaves
combine
with
a
mellow
white
grape
and
light
dried
banana
soursweetness
weighty
on
the
palate
but
light
in
body
lightly
expansive
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
but
retains
a
citric
juiciness
that
is
eminently
refreshing
in
humidity
like
this
after
barbecueing
some
salmon
filets
this
is
without
a
doubt
highly
drinkable
nice
wit
di
like
it
a
good
summertime
selection
and
a
good
session
beer
for
by
the
pool
or
at
the
beach
highly
recommend
this
beer
its
a
good
one
for
new
beer
drinkers
or
the
hopaverse
my
wife
loves
this
one
drinkability
id
drink
this
if
i
was
offered
it
anyday
but
thats
not
saying
much
its
very
refreshing
and
adventurous
for
the
taste
buds
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
nice

this
beer
is
extremely
refreshing
i
can
not
think
of
many
better
things
to
drink
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
definately
one
of
the
best
wit
biers
out
there
the
appearance
is
cloudy
with
a
good
amount
of
gold
smell
is
coriander
and
dried
orange
peel
as
you
would
expect
the
taste
is
very
refreshing
i
appreciate
this
white
ale
more
than
other
examples
because
i
feel
the
spices
are
well
balanced
in
more
extreme
examples
they
lose
what
makes
them
charming
as
the
flavors
you
appreciate
in
a
more
restrained
version
such
as
hoegaarden
try
to
bludgeon
you
to
death
about
the
head
mouthfeel
is
of
medium
density
and
drinkability
is
high
especially
when
the
temperatures
are
likewise
on
a
closing
note
i
dont
care
what
abuse
i
take
sometimes
i
enjoy
it
with
a
nice
slice
of
orange
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
perfect
for
the
hot
humid
days
of
summer
like
today
yeah
its
not
cheap
but
its
worth
it
this
is
a
nice
light
delicious
beer
that
packs
a
subtle
punch
the
head
is
stiff
and
frothy
white
with
an
nice
even
hue
of
whiteish
gold
the
smell
is
rich
of
lemon
spice
and
wheaty
citrus
the
taste
matches
your
nose
and
has
an
aggressive
kick
of
honey
as
it
flows
down
it
has
a
nice
consistent
flavor
that
is
sure
to
satisfy
given
the
presentation
the
taste
is
a
bit
disappointing
however
it
is
good
nice
spice
with
lots
of
undertones
that
come
out
in
the
after
taste
it
goes
down
nice
with
just
the
right
mount
of
fizz
my
biggest
complaint
is
that
it
needs
a
bolder
emphasis
on
the
flavour
d
a
well
balanced
beer
as
always
drinkability
this
is
one
of
the
best
witbiers
you
can
buy
for
the
price
and
availability
in
my
opinion
and
after
all
its
summer
for
around
10
for
a
6pack
and
for
how
much
food
you
can
enjoy
with
this
not
to
mention
the
abv
being
fairly
low
ill
be
drinking
hoegaarden
again
d
definitely
a
beer
you
could
put
back
many
of
in
an
evening
and
not
be
too
worried
about
the
effects
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
light
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
yet
not
challenging
enough
to
want
more
that
one
this
is
possibly
the
quintessential
lawnmowerthirst
quencher
and
a
personal
favorite
yum
this
is
an
excellent
hotweather
drink
and
fairly
easy
to
find
i
almost
always
keep
at
least
a
couple
in
my
fridge
the
only
downside
is
that
at
around
8
for
a
6pack
it
gets
kind
of
pricey
as
an
every
day
drink
i
wasnt
overly
impressed
here
but
not
disappointed
either
its
an
average
beer
that
would
work
for
a
sunny
day
beer
appeared
as
a
pale
yellow
and
was
served
with
a
very
good
head
nose
was
of
spices
and
maybe
a
hint
of
banana
taste
was
wheaty
spicy
up
front
hops
were
definitely
not
prominently
there
mouthfeel
was
lively
with
a
light
body
drinkability
was
very
good
this
is
a
nice
wheat
beer
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
drinkability
refreshing
and
enjoyable
even
if
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
plus
that
hoegaarden
glass
is
just
magnificent
pours
out
a
cloudy
lemonade
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
phenolic
with
the
wheat
snap
hardly
if
any
spicing
there
are
the
yeasty
and
wheaty
characteristics
in
the
flavor
but
it
seems
muted
kind
of
like
club
soda
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
carbonated
and
lively
but
is
too
watery
all
in
all
its
rather
refreshing
and
drinkable
a
light
wit
with
little
to
no
spicing
highly
recommended
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
it
is
very
refreshing
and
not
to
much
for
the
pallate
to
handle
i
will
definately
revisit
this
beer
cloudy
light
blonde
in
color
moderately
aromatic
full
of
fruit
and
spice
giving
a
scent
of
curacao
and
coriander
along
with
a
light
hint
of
hay
flavor
is
light
and
airy
coating
with
a
butter
toffee
blanket
and
loaded
with
light
spice
coriander
and
curacao
a
pleasant
yet
unexciting
witbier
boy
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
this
20
years
ago
drinkability
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
very
nice
introduction
to
wheat
beers
and
beer
reviews
looking
forward
to
pairing
this
one
with
a
nice
slab
of
grilled
salmon
over
the
summer
a
bottle
from
a
sixer
bought
by
dispholius
big
white
head
on
a
clear
and
cider
colored
beer
applepear
odor
not
much
else
going
on
very
weak
taste
with
some
light
spicy
and
sour
notes
really
just
like
a
good
belgian
thats
been
watered
down
considerably
thin
mouthfeel
not
a
pleasure
to
drink
wonderful
patio
beverage
smooth
and
slightly
sweet
overall
nothing
to
go
crazy
over
but
a
solid
summer
beer
i
like
great
lakes
holy
moses
better
in
this
style
but
this
is
neither
as
good
or
as
bad
as
many
people
say
it
is
drinkability
this
goes
down
easy
and
i
could
drink
several
in
any
one
sitting
i
prefer
to
have
with
lemon
tried
one
with
an
orange
and
found
that
it
was
not
as
good
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
this
ale
all
summer
long
although
id
like
to
see
a
bit
more
wheat
overall
its
not
too
bad
of
a
brew
unfortunately
it
seems
short
on
the
good
malt
flavors
and
creaminess
which
would
definitely
bump
it
a
bit
in
the
tastemouthfeel
d
a
nice
light
offering
especially
on
a
warm
day
can
sit
back
and
have
a
few
this
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
decent
sized
white
foamy
head
the
color
is
lighter
than
just
about
any
beer
ive
seen
the
smell
is
very
strong
and
aromatic
the
scents
of
pepperlemon
and
coriander
are
the
most
pronounced
smells
the
taste
has
a
creamy
lemonpepperand
wheat
flavor
that
is
very
good
and
refreshing
the
mf
is
light
and
the
flavors
are
all
well
balanced
this
is
a
great
summer
beerone
that
i
will
pick
up
as
the
temperature
goes
up
overall
really
enjoy
this
beer
and
the
fact
that
its
supremely
drinkable
enhances
its
appeal
everything
id
expect
from
the
style
and
comes
close
in
my
mind
to
being
a
wow
example
when
i
think
of
witbier
this
particular
one
comes
to
mind
instantly
i
can
only
imagine
what
it
must
be
like
to
get
locally
in
belgium
i
am
a
sucker
for
wits
especially
on
warm
days
it
hit
90f
here
for
the
first
time
this
year
here
where
i
find
them
refreshing
and
invigorating
i
have
not
had
this
in
a
long
time
but
i
am
quite
happy
to
drink
this
beer
it
is
certainly
much
better
than
quite
a
few
american
interpretations
of
this
brew
of
course
a
lot
of
the
american
interpretations
are
better
than
this
which
is
a
pleasant
experience
from
this
once
only
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
hoegaarden
many
times
over
the
past
few
years
but
i
thought
of
rating
this
after
just
having
it
the
other
night
at
a
work
party
which
amazed
me
since
they
usually
only
have
miller
lite
amstel
light
and
normal
beers
for
the
masses
no
that
hoegaarden
is
a
rare
beer
but
enjoyable
the
beer
poured
a
very
hazy
light
straw
color
with
a
bit
of
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
nice
and
citrusy
and
a
bit
of
a
wheat
nose
the
taste
is
very
crisp
lemony
with
a
nice
wheat
body
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
enjoyable
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
find
this
beer
very
drinkable
but
given
to
me
its
unusual
flavor
would
not
be
top
choice
all
the
time
but
a
good
springsummer
brew
this
one
is
fairly
drinkable
but
i
think
after
a
couple
i
would
be
looking
for
a
change
of
pace
not
bad
not
great
hoegaarden
is
an
ultrahazy
straw
color
head
is
large
and
frothy
aroma
is
spicy
and
yeasty
clove
with
a
bit
of
bubblegum
are
noted
taste
has
a
crisp
wheat
flavor
with
plenty
of
peppery
spice
and
phenols
overall
there
is
plenty
of
flavor
here
with
enough
complexity
to
keep
things
interesting
this
is
an
easy
choice
for
a
summerspring
beer
came
a
hazy
light
honey
color
with
a
one
finger
white
cap
and
lemon
slice
in
a
mug
cap
dissipated
quickly
due
to
lemon
anway
smell
was
clean
grainy
yeast
and
lots
of
citrus
flavor
was
citrus
and
biscuit
the
grains
came
out
very
nicely
and
had
a
mellow
hop
bitterness
some
spice
was
coming
through
but
not
too
strong
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
with
medium
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
i
enjoy
tap
much
better
than
the
bottle
of
this
beer
taste
predominantly
lemon
nice
buttery
moutfeel
makes
it
nice
and
smooth
nice
spiciness
keeps
things
interesting
very
light
and
refreshing
ill
buy
this
again
sometime
in
the
heat
of
summer
drinkablity
light
yet
flavorful
quite
drinkable
the
drinkability
is
a
moot
point
edit
oh
how
our
beer
taste
bud
grow
over
time
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
solid
wit
that
i
could
drink
all
night
long
always
revisit
beers
after
some
time
you
may
find
your
tastes
have
changed
when
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
was
this
nice
yellowishwhite
color
with
a
2
finger
head
of
white
color
foam
the
head
of
foam
receded
very
slowly
leaving
behind
plenty
of
lace
behind
it
it
had
a
light
aroma
of
different
citrus
fruits
cloves
and
some
yeast
in
the
background
the
taste
was
very
much
like
the
smell
it
had
many
different
citrus
fruits
mostly
lemons
cloves
and
this
all
ended
with
a
taste
of
yeast
all
i
can
i
say
about
the
mouthfeel
is
that
is
smooth
light
and
crisp
this
would
make
for
a
very
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
summers
day
pretty
much
an
average
belgain
wit
beer
d
probably
better
as
a
summertime
drink
goes
down
quite
easy
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
clear
first
day
of
summer
beer
only
wish
the
lemon
aroma
stuck
around
a
little
longer
sessions
very
well
due
to
the
moderate
5
abv
i
always
find
hoegaarden
or
wits
in
general
as
a
perfect
summer
drink
sometimes
when
i
long
for
the
warm
weather
i
will
get
a
six
pack
of
this
and
sort
of
mentally
imagine
it
being
90
degrees
out
while
sipping
on
one
of
these
i
think
that
this
beer
would
be
a
decent
session
beer
it
is
mild
enough
to
not
get
overbearing
also
the
alcohol
content
is
low
enough
to
allow
you
to
enjoy
a
few
while
not
my
favorite
beer
this
beer
is
good
and
worthy
of
buying
an
other
bottle
in
the
future
always
one
of
my
favorites
and
mixes
well
too
for
those
who
arent
too
found
of
beer
doing
half
this
with
half
lemonade
is
fantastic
little
trick
i
learned
in
germany
while
drinking
wheat
beers
a
few
years
ago
cheers
drinkability
drinkability
suffered
due
to
the
strange
taste
but
it
was
refreshing
as
a
drink
so
i
think
it
is
good
over
all
very
hazy
and
pale
goldenyellow
color
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
some
nice

to

mouthfeel

with
a

this
witbier
is
definatly
quite
drinkable
refreshing
appetizing
and
thirst
quenching
a
really
nice
beer
that
ill
definitely
have
again
pours
a
thick
white
twofinger
head
and
a
very
cloudy
light
yellow
color
looks
interesting
citrus
and
clove
smells
jump
out
of
the
bottle
even
before
pouring
tastes
and
mouthfeel
both
are
a
little
thin
the
nose
is
the
srong
point
for
this
beer
a
super
thirst
quencher
however
and
thus
a
very
rare
from
me
5
awarded
for
drinkability
md
smooth
with
some
viscosity
parching
finish
compromises
drink
ability
especially
for
a
white
beer
so
supposedly
this
is
the
benchmark
witbier
or
according
to
some
it
used
to
be
until
it
was
bought
by
inbev
pours
a
very
hazy
pale
straw
colored
tinged
with
green
decent
head
but
the
green
tinge
is
a
bit
offputting
the
nose
is
centered
around
coriander
with
a
basis
of
citrus
lemonorange
some
kind
of
hybrid
very
warm
smelling
and
appealing
the
taste
is
dominated
by
carbonation
up
front
then
the
coriander
and
a
late
lemony
taste
in
the
back
of
the
throat
oddly
enough
the
taste
structure
and
mouthfeel
is
very
light
like
the
wine
spritzer
of
the
beer
world
but
in
a
good
way
this
is
one
tasty
eminently
quaffable
beer
whose
reputation
is
justifed
imo
although
id
love
to
taste
the
older
version
of
this
beer
if
its
actually
different
like
people
say
an
old
standby
for
me
i
always
go
to
this
beer
when
i
cant
make
a
decision
on
anything
else
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
and
strangely
white
almost
a
cross
between
a
lemonade
and
a
cream
soda
lots
of
lemon
and
honey
flavors
subtle
amounts
of
carbonation
good
in
any
season
at
a
low
abv
as
with
most
witbiers
this
is
an
eminently
drinkable
enjoyable
thankfully
easytofind
brew
its
always
good
but
the
one
hesitation
i
have
with
it
is
ive
found
it
to
be
one
of
the
more
inconsistent
beers
my
previous
experiences
with
it
have
varied
widely
from
tap
to
bottle
and
amongst
all
the
bottles
ive
had
dozens
ive
found
it
somewhat
temperamental
to
all
the
usual
beer
variables
more
so
than
most
heat
cold
sunlight
darkness
temperature
served
glassware
used
amount
of
sediment
swirled
into
the
glass
etc
its
never
been
bad
just
often
varying
a
few
degrees
one
way
or
another
not
sure
if
its
me
or
the
beer
im
guessing
the
beer
but
i
thought
id
mention
it
ill
probably
be
picking
more
of
these
up
when
the
weather
gets
hot
pours
with
a
halfinch
head
with
some
retention
color
is
an
amazing
offwhite
with
massive
cloudiness
fine
lacing
smell
is
nice
and
strong
with
notes
of
lemon
orange
wheat
belgian
yeast
and
perhaps
a
bit
of
clove
spice
taste
is
mild
citrusy
and
wheaty
lightly
sweet
and
sour
both
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
light
but
it
coats
well
and
has
solid
carbonation
drinkability
is
nice
not
too
strong
or
too
heavy
making
it
easy
to
have
a
few
this
isnt
really
a
thinking
mans
brew
i
wouldnt
say
but
for
a
hot
summers
day
i
think
its
a
great
pick
think
spiced
fizzy
lemonade
yum
this
brew
was
a
pleasant
surprise
it
comes
highly
recommended
from
a
trusted
ba
i
will
be
sure
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
future
especially
once
it
warms
up
outside
a
high
quality
consistent
brew
opinion
i
am
really
enjoying
this
beer
it
has
a
light
but
complex
flavor
profile
that
tells
me
that
i
can
put
these
away
all
night
the
wheat
takes
a
bit
of
getting
used
to
but
i
like
the
fact
that
they
arent
accompanied
with
a
bunch
of
cloves
and
bananas
like
you
get
just
across
the
border
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
before
but
that
was
before
i
was
really
working
on
my
palate
i
would
like
to
drink
this
beer
more
nice
light
yellow
color
with
white
cloudiness
to
it
and
a
fair
white
head
the
smell
and
taste
of
this
beer
are
quite
similar
and
pretty
much
the
standard
for
the
style
lots
of
corriander
loads
of
yeast
and
a
bit
of
clean
citrus
i
got
more
citrus
in
the
nose
than
on
the
tongue
and
more
yeast
on
the
tongue
than
the
nose
standard
is
what
keeps
coming
to
mind
with
this
one
a
beer
to
judge
all
other
white
beers
by
this
is
my
first
witbier
so
i
really
didnt
know
too
much
what
to
expect
after
the
pour
i
quickly
realized
why
it
is
called
a
wit
ive
never
actually
had
a
beer
pour
this
light
had
to
grab
my
quadmate
and
show
him
this
interesting
hue
its
creamy
clear
with
a
slight
yellow
tinge
the
smell
is
pretty
decent
coriander
and
citrus
dominate
smell
is
on
par
with
what
i
was
expecting
taste
is
pretty
good
coriander
really
comes
through
strong
with
a
crisp
refreshing
aftertaste
this
is
a
fairly
smooth
brew
the
flavors
subside
quickly
in
the
aftertaste
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
ton
of
this
in
the
warmer
months
to
come
this
is
one
of
those
beerstyles
similar
to
a
biere
de
garde
and
a
saison
in
where
the
taste
doesnt
initially
wow
me
but
i
find
myself
buying
it
on
a
weekly
basis
because
i
really
do
like
it
i
like
the
way
this
beer
tastes
but
i
also
find
it
to
be
very
bland
at
5
abv
i
dont
expect
this
beer
to
be
a
powerhouse
of
flavor
however
judging
this
against
the
best
witbiers
that
ive
had
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
that
this
beer
is
just
lacking
in
the
flavor
department
hence
i
can
only
rate
it
as
average
for
taste
i
do
like
the
way
it
looks
though
this
is
the
first
time
ive
had
a
wit
in
a
while
and
i
forgot
just
how
pale
these
things
are
kind
of
cool
that
something
so
pale
can
taste
good
can
actually
have
some
taste
at
all
drinkability
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
row
and
be
happy
very
drinkable
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
drinks
smoothly
and
easily
a
pleasant
surprise
and
a
beer
i
would
gladly
order
again
nothing
special
in
the
mouthfeel
medium
carbonation
but
at
5
abv
this
is
an
easy

for
drinkability
now

and
for
all
its
pronounced

heard
at

the

corrected

mispronunciation

i
might
be
wrong

that

before
i
got
heavily
into
beer
tasting
this
beer
is
an
unfiltered
wheat
that
is
combined
with
orange
peel
and
a
little
bit
of
a
peppery
taste
to
make
an
excellent
white
ale
this
is
essentially
the
grandpa
of
that
style
it
drinks
easily
superb
carbonation
that
tickles
the
tongue
and
a
more
aggressive
mouthfeel
great
beer
to
drink
though

then

very

finishes

i
would
probably
fall
off

i
think
this
beer
would
go
wonderfully
with
some
spicy
food
pour
rest
so
i
did
when
all
the
beer
was
in
my
pilzner

perhaps
delicious

with

very
similar

top
original
but
without
the

highly
recommend
this
beer
perfect
for
after
a
hike
tastes
like
a
giant
banana
jammed
into
a
wheat
beer
by
far
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
i
cant
have
an
ipa
a
nice

nothing
special

still
a
good

made
even
better
with
a

a

this
is

beer
very
good

doesnt
need
an
orange
slice
in
it
to
have
that
perfect
taste
noticeably
orangey
and
sweet
without
going
over
the
top
delicious
light
and
refreshing
really
light
has
a
citrus
and
floral
taste
delicious
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
ive
had
just
excellent
all
around
like
yellow
pee
in
color
you
can
see
the
carbonation
bubbles
constantly
going
to
the
top
hints
of
orange
when
smelling
it
too
light
in
flavor
to
me
like
drinking
a
carbonated
apple
juice
a
very
good
beer
not
quite
outstanding
but
very
enjoyable
this
is
one
of
the
best
belgian
style
wit
beers
ive
sampled
it
has
all
the
hints
of
coriander
and
orange
that
other
wit
beers
have
similar
to
hoegaarden
and
what
i
enjoyed
the
most
about
this
beer
is
how
crisp
the
flavor
and
pleasing
the
aftertaste
this
is
one
smooth
drink
will
definitely
have
some
more
worth
a
try
not
quite
as
good
as
allagash
white
o
a
very
nice
take
on
the
classic
belgian
witbier
very
nice
for
spring
through
late
summer
very
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
by
far
and
away
one
of
the
better
summer
beers
for

i
am
not
typically
a
huge
wheat
beer
fan
but
this
one
is
great
overall
an
ok
beer
overall
it
comes
off
kind
of
weak
and
really
theres
no
wheat
depth
to
this
at
all
drinks
like
sweet
tang
kool
aid
fruit
punch
orange
more
than
anything
o
this
is
a
good
solid
beer
but
has
some
areas
leaving
me
less
then
impressed
after
the
pour
the
beer
was
very
flat
in
appearance
taste
was
great
but
wish
it
was
kicked
up
a
notch
it
seems
a
little
mellow
and
subdued
harpoons
ufo
white
is
a
top
notch
brew
through
and
throughof
course
if
you
are
not
a
fan
of
the

will
probably
hate
it
derp
anywayi
myself
love
this
amazing
witbiera
very
snappy
bitter
orange
flavorand
nice
wheat
backbone
with
an
almost
champagne
like
carbonation
love
it
reminds
me
of
blue
moon
but
with
added
bitterness
hazy
with
a
white
head
looks
like
a
witbier
smell
is
heavy
on
the
bitter
orange
and
plenty
of
coriander
flavor
is
strong
on
the
citrus
flavor
aftertaste
needs
to
be
cleaner
otherwise
ok
but
definitely
room
for
improvement
a
below
average
belgian
wit
pours
a
hazy
yellow
like
grapefruit
juice
with
a
thin
white
head
served
way
too
cold
but
allowing
it
to
warm
didnt
awaken
the
brew
as
id
hoped
theres
a
nice
bready
biscuit
thing
going
on
and
the
brew
is
quite
pleasant
theres
nothing
offputting
but
nothing
noteworthy
either

ive
had
in

just

ive
tried
good
ranges
from
okay
to
excellent
depending
on
format
had
a
great
version
in

earlier
this
year
too
much
inconsistency
o
a
light
fruity
and
refreshing
wheat
that
pusheds
the
orange
flavor
to
the
fore
enjoyed
this
more
than
expected
o
its
spring
time
in
new
england
so
i
figured
id
give
this
another
go
i
was
able
to
discern
a
couple
new
flavors
specifically
the
bubblegum
and
grassiness
its
drinkable
but
not
terribly
enjoyable
for
me
best
consumed
cold
and
quickly
note
edited
from
last
year
my
score
for
this
increased
a
bit
tastes
mild
and
approachable
as
a
session
beer
or
a
beginners
craft
beer
with
plenty
of
orange
citrus
and
a
kiss
of
spice
around
the
edges
and
while
this
seems
to
lack
the
complexity
and
depth
of
a
typical
german
hefeweizen
its
still
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
wheat
beer
that
should
appeal

just

this
beer
again
witbiers
arent

i
enjoyed
this
beer
like
the
smooth
combo
of
malt
and
wheat
and
the
cirtusy
falvor
was
natural
tasting
and
not
overly
sweet
not
a
beer
id
buy
on
its
own
but
ill
certainly
enjoy
the
other
one
from
the

pack
perhaps
i
was
just
bummed
that
the

this
beer
is

clean

days
in

but
the
mouth
feel
in

leaves
something
to
be
desired
usually
with

the
taste
is
refreshing
and
then
lingers
with

this
had
the
refresh
but
each
sip
didnt
excite
me
to
come
back
to
the
next
this
is
a
do
not

again
for
me
o
as
some
have
said
it
would
be
unfair
and
unreasonable
to
expect
this
to
be
on

with
some
of
the

in

the

that

prefer
to
this
are

that
being
said
the
very
fact
that
such
a
decent

wit
can
be
found
in

for

in

a

cant

it
gained

the

makes
this
a

tough
to
drink
a
lot
of
screw
everything
youve
heard
about
this
beer
its
a
witbier
so
fine
it
very
close
to
a
wine
in
character
paid
nearly
9
for
the
bottle
and
saved
for
a
special
occasion
its
a
food
beer
three
of
us
enjoyed
it
with
a
fried
walleye
nothing
couldve
been
better
we
all
agreed
it
was
a
delicious
accompaniment
keep
that
in
mind
when
you
sip
this
enjoy
every
taste
its
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
enjoyed
good
my
eye
its
top
dog
a
refreshing
and
balanced
wit
maintains
the
lightness
and
refreshing
spice
of
a
traditional
wit
while
packing
some
interesting
barrel
and
brett
acidity
and
tart
character
i
thought
aside
from
the
gush
on
the
open
this
was
a
well
put
together
beer
noticeable
tart
lime
and
gooseberry
flavours
along
the
coriander
and
citric
orange
a
bit
yeast
forward
at
the
start
but
it
flows
nicely
into
the
spicy
and
tart
fruit
body
i
enjoyed
the
concept
and
beer
certainly
one
i
would
recommend
for
fans
of
brett
as
well
as
to
have
myself
again
overall
certainly
tasty
and
worth
trying
especially
if
you
are
a
saison
or
wit
fan
but
for
the
price
i
will
probably
pass
on
this
next
time
o
a
tasty
and
complex
beer
with
lots
of
interesting
flavours
finishes
a
bit
too
dry
and
im
not
a
fan
of
the
bubbly
mouthfeel
but
other
than
that
great
stuff
a
nice
tasty
wit
for
sure
an
interesting
enough
witbier
the
typically
average
sweetness
perhaps
lacking
here
but
the
expected
adjuncts
doing
well
to
blend
and
provide
a
balanced
flavour
im
not
sure
the
funkitude
of
the
yeast
is
all
that
welcome
though
by
the
style
and
certainly
not
by
this
camper
kind
of
detracts
from
the
ease
of
drinkability
i
gotta
say
o
a
great
beer
but
not
as
a
wit
light
and
tart
with
some
nice
funk
which
makes
it
a
great
summer
sipper
ointeresting
witbier
refreshing
and
enjoyable
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
funky
white
ale
it
had
most
of
the
aspects
that
i
would
expect
in
a
white
ale
and
the
spices
werent
overpowering
but
it
had
just
enough
funk
to
identify
it
as
a
jolly
pumpkin
beer
this
beer
had
great
drinkability
it
was
smooth
clean
crisp
slightly
prickly
refreshing
and
the
taste
did
a
good
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
would
have
no
problem
taking
out
a
big
bottle
or
a
few
of
these
smaller
bottles
especially
on
a
warm
day
in
the
summer
i
almost
wish
it
came
in
cans
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
aroma
and
drinkability
i
thought
they
were
both
very
nice
and
to
me
they
were
the
highlights
of
this
beer
what
i
like
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
there
isnt
anything
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
and
now
that
its
in
smaller
bottles
i
can
see
myself
keeping
a
couple
bottles
in
the
fridge
all
summer
long
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
doesnt
mind
a
little
funk
in
their
beer
all
i
all
i
was
pretty
happy
with
this
beer
i
forgot
just
how
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
and
on
a
warm
evening
like
tonight
its
really
hitting
the
spot
this
isnt
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
beer
but
its
still
a
damn
solid
addition
to
their
lineup
and
so
far
its
my
favorite
funky
white
ale
great
job
guys

was

of

characteristics
in

on

is

with

sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly

this
is

beer

is

i
love
the
acidity
with
the
coriander
very
citrusy
but
balanced
with
the
oak
the
bottle
itself
looks
so
nice
i
opened
this
one
at
a
friends
party
and
this
was
a
hit
the
beer
is
not
a
uniform
taste
but
you
taste
some
acidity
and
then
the
classic
wheat
beer
taste
i
also
tasted
the
pumpkin
but
more
like
a
syrup
that
was
following
a
somewhat
sour
beer
if
i
can
use
a
cupcake
as
an
analogy
the
cake
was
a
bit
sour
the
frosting
tasted
like
pumpkin
i
dont
know
if
this
was
done
in
an
effort
to
make
it
artisanal

this

is

not
in

just
a

offputting
as
it
overpowers
the

the
finish
does
in

have
a
tartness
to
it
that
i
find
to
increase
the
crispness
of
this
brew
not
quite
as
tart
as
a
lambic
and
reminded
me
vaguely
of

taste
was
mostly
clean

loads

but
once
you
do
light

color
the
head
retention
on
this
beer
is
something
to
brag
about
the
nose
is
orange
dominated
appears
a
light
golden
cider
with
clouded
yeast
particles
suspended
throughout
the
head
is
a
bit
spritzy
but
overcarbonation
doesnt
come
through
at
all

texture

with

with
heavy

really
piercing

tart

aging
really
brings
about
some
cider
notes
not
the
overly
sweetened
versions

those
drier
in

brings
out
perfume
like
layers
of
coriander
with

possible
spices
citrus
tartness
with
bitter

through
bready
wild

notes
play
their

nicely
adding
to
the
ever
growing
complexity
of
jolly
pumpkin
beers
artisan
ales
at
their
finest
dry
soothing
finish
with
the
spices
really
leaving
a
coating
on

slight

of

dryness
blended
with

great
mix
wonderful
finish
drinkability
is
so
sessionable
at

and
in
addition
its
complex
enough
to
keep
one
refreshed
and
intrigued
throughout
each
bottle
excellent
and
dont
hold
back
on
any
of
the
yeast
sediment
oh
and
i
get
some
creamy
bubblegum
chalky
finish
thing
going
on
that
i
really
dig
like
stale
bubblegum
with
cardboard
accents
from
a
pack
of
baseball
cards
nice
i
really
really
do
not
get
the
brett
thing
and
am
regretting
like
hell
that
i
bought
an
entire
sixer
of
this
i
should
have
known
that
this
is
an
acquired
taste
that
happens
to
not
be
my
cup
of
tea
if
i
wanted
this
sour
brett
stuff
my
mistake
i
guess
i
should
have
just
bought
some
wine
the
sweet
looking
bottles
finally
lured
me
in
though
and
despite
knowing
that
they
use
brett
shouldnt
this
be
a
fucking
flaw
i
figured
they
wouldnt
use
it
in
a
wit
right
woops
this
looks
like
a
nice
wit
and
smells
like
one
too
but
in
the
mouth
its
all
sourness
and
astringency
like
a
beer
gone
horribly
wrong
if
anyone
wants
the
rest
of
this
sixer
and
lives
in
the
naperville
area
please
come
and
take
it
before
i
pour
it
down
the
drain
im
dead
serious
just
email
me
and
its
yours
its
taking
up
precious
space
in
my
beer
fridge
if
you
like
witbiers
you
should
search
this
one
out
jolly
pumpkin
hasnt
let
me
down
yet
this
is
a
very
good
witbeer
all
around
the
only
downside
is
that
there
is
relatively
no
head
on
this
beer
it
pours
a
hazy
orange
with
lots
of
yeasty
bits
and
residue
floating
around
a
settling
right
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
head
lacing
and
retention
are
the
lows
the
smell
is
very
good
it
was
clearly
yeasty
spritz
coriander
maybe
some
clove
citrus
and
another
smell
i
couldnt
place
until
i
read
other
reviews
and
came
up
with
it
definitely
a
ginger
ale
fizz
spot
on
the
taste
wont
disappoint
in
that
you
will
get
a
medium
bodied
well
carbonated
coriander
spicy
ale
with
a
yeasty
tartness
that
is
both
refreshing
and
bracing
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
and
the
aftertaste
is
tart
but
good
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
lchaim
overall
a
very
unique
witbier
stays
in
line
more
with
other
jolly
pumpkin
offerings
than
the
style
so
if
you
like
their
other
beers
you
should
definately
try
this
one
as
the
beer
spills
from
the
12ounce
bottle
the
color
is
foggy
yellow
with
a
perfect
white
hue
head
is
a
huge
pile
of
cotton
to
crown
the
body
as
it
slowly
dematerializes
and
the
lacing
forms
a
white
curtain
to
drape
the
glass
nose
has
a
rich
bread
dough
aroma
aromatic
spices
coriander
cloves
and
a
nice
orange
peel
hint
to
accompany
the
crispness
start
is
sweet
with
grain
and
spices
a
bit
of
tartness
at
the
back
top
is
light
to
medium
finish
has
a
prickly
acidity
sweet
with
a
touchy
of
hop
spiciness
quite
dry
aftertaste
lingers
long
a
fine
representative
to
the
style
dnotes
great
take
on
a
witbier
very
drinkable
i
wasnt
crazy
about
this
one
its
too
much
of
what
seems
to
be
a
white
winebeer
blend
not
bad
just
odd
and
not
my
cup
of
tea
id
call
this
one
average
at
best
overall
d
a
good
beer
but
somewhat
one
dimensional
however
i
would
have
this
one
again
if
i
needed
a
sweet
change
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
aromas
of
peach
skin
corriander
and
fruity
and
tart
in
the
taste
a
bit
thin
corriander
peach
and
tartness
a
smooth
small
tart
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
sourness
aftertaste
i
really
dig
the
peach
flavor
smooth
tartness
with
a
light
alcohol
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
but
some
off
flavors
deter
a
bit
a
light
bit
off
style
for
me
but
overall
everything
is
good
d
an
easy
drinker
feels
like
you
could
treat
the
750ml
bottle
like
a
12ozer
saw
that
this
beer
now
comes
in
six
packs
so
i
had
to
pick
up
a
single
to
give
it
a
go
pours
a
cool
golden
somewhat
murky
color
with
a
nice
head
that
accumulates
rapidly
and
holds
up
very
well
sediment
can
also
be
seen
accumulating
toward
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
has
something
so
familiar
in
it
but
i
cannot
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
perhaps
the
slight
funk
of
hard
boiled
eggs
it
definitely
has
a
certain
stink
to
it
but
in
a
very
good
way
other
aromas
i
smelled
included
vinegar
sour
cherries
and
lemon
taste
is
full
of
tart
lemon
flavors
and
a
bit
of
green
apple
it
finishes
somewhat
on
the
dry
side
in
a
way
that
is
similar
to
the
way
a
gueze
leaves
you
mouthfeel
is
light
with
good
dose
of
carbonation
to
liven
things
up
a
bit
very
easy
to
drink
as
well
if
you
are
in
to
other
funky
wild
ales
what
a
beer
i
will
be
getting
this
beer
again
for
sure
probably
the
most
interesting
example
of
this
style
i
have
tasted
bottle
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
aroma
of
lemon
and
orange
very
winelike
nice
mouthfeel
flavor
is
sour
with
a
lemony
touch
to
it
not
as
flavorful
as
i
would
have
thought
i
expected
more
of
a
winelike
taste
to
it
a
decent
sour
but
not
my
favorite
bright
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
the
nose
is
full
tart
and
the
taste
is
sour
goodness
with
a
little
fruitiness
god
i
wish
i
hadnt
burned
my
tongue
on
some
soup
earlier
in
the
day
this
is
the
best
wit
beer
i
have
ever
had
and
another
winner
from
jolly
pumpkin
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
enjoyable
jolly
pumpkin
beers
are
not
cheap
but
you
definitely
get
what
you
pay
for
and
i
love
the
funkiness
a
nice
beer
for
a
hot
day
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
brew
from
jolly
pumpkin
and
i
think
i
can
honestly
say
its
giving
la
roja
a
strong
fight
for
my
favorite
of
their
brews
id
recommend
this
beer
to
just
about
anybody
not
just
beer
fans
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
slight
head
that
disipates
rather
quickly
smell
is
spicy
but
somewhat
reserved
smell
is
carbonated
with
some
wine
like
flavors
im
getting
some
lemon
zest
as
well
as
some
white
grapes
very
crisp
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
not
the
funk
bomb
that
is
anticipated
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
d
measuring
drinkability
by
the
standard
of
if
i
would
have
another
this
is
a
one
however
it
is
fairly
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
i
liked
it
but
i
wont
be
enjoying
this
one
again
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
you
like
the
wild
ales
i
love
them
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
how
they
can
be
restrained
and
refreshing
the
low
alcohol
also
adds
to
the
drink
all
day
in
the
sun
factor
if
only
it
was
more
affordable
it
would
be
by
go
to
hot
day
beer
pretty
much
the
perfect
wit
for
me
at
least
commercially
available
if
i
tried
to
brew
this
myself
id
probably
add
a
little
candi
sugar
to
punch
up
the
abv
about
1
5
while
still
keeping
the
body
light
but
the
fact
is
i
really
love
this
one
in
fact
as
i
worked
my
way
through
the
bottle
i
kept
bumping
up
my
scores
to
the
point
that
its
probably
one
of
my
highest
rated
beers
and
rightly
so
for
my
tastes
pours
a
faint
yellow
with
a
two
finger
head
aroma
is
very
enticing
orange
peel
and
spices
definitely
has
that
signature
jolly
pumpkin
taste
which
i
am
not
sure
how
to
explain
must
be
the
yeast
very
pleasant
blend
of
orangey
citrus
with
the
mild
wheat
very
tasty
too
much
carbonation
and
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
would
be
interesting
to
try
a
slightly
sweeter
version
although
i
like
the
clean
aftertaste
im
happy
w
the
jp
offerings
so
far
although
for
the
i
might
hit
something
else
first
d
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
different
then
most
other
whits
i
have
had
and
worth
a
try
i
wouldnt
drink
a
lot
of
it
or
often
but
i
would
recommend
it
overall
this
was
different
from
any
witbier
ive
had
before
but
i
really
enjoy
jps
interpretation
of
the
style
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
definitely
my
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
much
better
representation
of
style
than
hoegaarden
and
blue
moon
excellent
on
a
warm
summer
day
like
most
wheat
buy
it
and
try
it
overall
an
enjoyable
lighter
beer
its
interesting
for
a
wit
a
little
more
tart
fruits
than
spices
this
is
more
of
what
i
was
expecting
from
the
bam
biere
pours
a
very
pale
gold
hazy
and
with
a
decent
head
that
fades
all
too
quickly
the
smell
is
light
lemon
and
orange
with
a
very
slight
spiciness
the
taste
is
light
and
refreshing
lemon
and
orange
again
followed
by
a
faint
hit
of
coriander
and
a
light
grassiness
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
and
very
thirst
quenching
i
really
like
the
jolly
pumpkin
brews
but
this
one
is
really
really
light
its
enjoyable
but
there
could
be
some
more
substance
to
it
perhaps
some
more
time
in
the
bottle
would
bring
out
some
more
funk
or
sour
as
is
a
simple
summer
quaffer
overall
im
not
too
impressed
with
this
beer
it
has
some
good
reviews
up
so
i
might
try
it
again
and
hopefully
get
a
better
bottle
next
time
d
jolly
pumpkin
seems
to
have
missed
the
mark
on
this
brew
too
bad
because
ive
enjoyed
all
of
their
other
beers
that
ive
tried
so
far
this
beer
is
way
too
onedimensional
in
its
tartness
for
me
to
even
think
about
having
another
abv
is
not
a
factor
at
4
8
buy
with
caution
light
bodied
with
refreshing
carbonation
great
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
summer
im
enjoying
this
sour
beer
its
an
interesting
take
on
the
wit
syle
overall
a
very
good
beer
and
very
much
worth
a
try
its
not
as
heavy
and
belgian
as
some
other
witbiers
and
thats
a
good
thing
overall
this
is
a
nice
soft
introduction
to
the
sour
beers
of
jolly
pumpkin
the
people
whom
ive
shared
this
with
none
of
them
being
big
craft
beer
drinkers
were
very
pleased
with
it
the
sourness
intrigues
but
doesnt
overwhelm
not
my
personal
favorite
jolly
pumpkin
though
highly
carbonated
very
easy
drinking
and
very
good
carbonation
may
be
slightly
too
much
and
the
zip
and
sparkle
may
actually
take
away
some
fruit
profile
orange
peel
and
corriander
with
freshly
squeezed
lemon
and
new
oak
flavors
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
with
zingy
acidity
on
the
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
ive
been
more
impressed
with
some
other
jolly
pumpkin
beers
poured
from
a
750ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
was
a
yellow
faintly
hazy
beer
with
a
small
head
it
had
a
fruity
spiced
wheat
aroma
it
had
a
citrus
taste
orange
mostly
decent
tartness
and
some
warming
spice
i
thought
it
was
a
little
too
bubbly
and
not
a
beer
id
want
to
drink
a
lot
of
in
the
flavour
the
coriander
and
marjoram
flavours
stand
out
most
followed
by
a
bit
of
zesty
citrus
and
a
lactic
sourness
the
carbonation
while
massive
in
the
glass
isnt
obnoxious
on
the
palate
and
just
moves
the
flavour
around
pretty
refreshing
with
a
nice
dry
finish
id
say
this
is
a
light
and
easy
drinking
wit
flavourful
but
not
obnoxious
with
some
unique
tastes
in
there
750
ml
bottle
shared
with
trevorwideman
vibrant
yellow
in
colour
with
strong
carbonation
not
too
much
haze
for
a
witbier
strong
coriander
aromas
with
secondary
notes
of
marjoram
thanks
to
my
spice
drawer
for
picking
that
one
out
lemon
and
a
bit
of
oat
spritzy
and
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
moderate
amount
of
lactic
sourness
the
herbal
character
is
stronger
in
the
mouth
as
are
the
oats
focused
and
clean
finishing
citrus
finish
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
of
that
slick
oaty
body
and
a
bit
less
coriander
on
the
nose
but
its
still
a
pretty
good
wit
it
pours
a
hazy
goldenorange
color
with
only
a
little
bit
of
head
and
some
nice
lacing
there
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
citrus
hops
in
the
this
beer
but
then
it
blends
into
a
orange
aroma
dry
light
vinous
spices
take
over
this
beer
almost
phenolic
makes
me
think
of
eating
a
raw
onion
ala
lt
riggs
style
the
mouthfeel
is
sharp
dry
and
crisp
but
rather
harsh
on
the
palette
hard
to
enjoy
im
going
to
go
ahead
and
maybe
purchase
a
bottle
of
this
in
hopes
that
it
is
just
bad
tap
d
i
probably
wouldnt
drink
a
ton
of
these
by
choice
but
i
also
wouldnt
complain
about
sucking
down
a
halfdozen
poolside
or
on
the
beach
this
is
a
really
nice

be
a
great

quaffer
d
enjoy
this
one
very
cold
on
a
nice
sunny
summer
day
good
palate
cleanser
and
was
beautiful
when
paired
with
a
sweet
yellow
curry
would
get
a
little
less
appetizing
with
more
than
a
couple
pints
pours
a
hazy

with
a
brilliantly
white

looks
about
like
it

is
oranges
yeast

corriander
then
lemon
pinesol
the
lemon
really
doesnt
work
here
at
all
mouthfeel
is
slightly
overcarbonated
even
for
the
style
drinkability
is
average
insteresting

but
the
lemonfreshness
doesnt
quite
jive
with
the
orangespiciness
poured
into
a
tulip
pint
very
hazy
pale
golden
pour
with
a
huge
head
that
leaves
some
tremendous
lacing
both
on
the
surface
of
the
beer
and
the
sides
of
the
glass
smell
is
very
yeastybreadish
with
some
citrus
and
little
something
i
cant
identify
but
the
smell
is
very
nice
taste
is
citrusy
maybe
even
a
bit
of
sour
apple
up
front
with
a
breadlike
almost
chewy
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
for
this
style
nice
carbonation
this
would
be
great
for
the
summer
next
to
the
pool
its
very
refreshing
too
bad
it
is
15f
outside
right
now
recommended
750
ml
bottle
with
a
dark
mysterious
label
appearance
is
nice
before
the
beer
is
even
opened
pours
a
pale
golden
hue
maybe
slightly
orange
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
shrinks
but
never
disappears
smells
of
fresh
orange
juice
coriander
and
earth
freshly
turned
fertile
top
soil
with
grass
clippings
mixed
in
taste
is
brilliant
like
a
very
earthy
and
spicy
mimosa
no
flavor
ever
dominating
the
citrus
and
spice
chase
each
other
across
the
palate
with
each
sip
lively
in
the
mouth
creamy
with
a
carbonation
level
that
hints
at
champagne
immensely
drinkable
entertaining
enjoyable
truly
a
craft
beer
hmm
this
beer
is
a
cloudy
yellow
there
is
a
fair
head
the
smell
is
typical
of
the
style
the
taste
is
typical
as
well
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
typical
too
typical
as
in
my
least
favorite
style
this
is
the
first
beer
of
the
bif
i
have
tried
it
can
only
go
up
from
here
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
may
be
a
little
more
tolerable
but
not
on
a
cold
winter
day
beside
a
wood
stove
drinkability
good
boolshot
and
marvz
contributed
this
to
my

for

cheers
this
beer
really
seems
suited
for
my
taste
buds

thoroughly
enjoyable
for
a
sunday
morning
brew
the
white
pumpkin
pours
a
hazy
yellowgold
body
beneath
a
fluffy
head
of
bright
white
the
head
retention
is
great
no
doubt
buoyed
by
the
effervescent
bubbles
rising
from
beneath
but
the
lacing
is
limited
the
nose
is
oaky
with
some
orangelemon
and
nondescript
spice
beneath
its
light
bodied
and
zesty
in
the
mouth
with
a
very
finebubbled
effervescent
natural
carbonation
from
bottle
conditioning
the
flavor
is
oaky
and
dry
upfront
followed
by
a
spritz
of
orangelemon
and
a
touch
of
gingerlike
spice
coriander
becomes
apparent
in
the
finish
tart
refreshing
dry
it
has
a
low
bitterness
to
it
but
its
still
very
dry
in
the
finish
no
doubt
in
great
part
to
the
oakaging
delicate
enjoyable
d
fantastic
i
loved
this
beer
it
was
interesting
flavororful
and
quaffable
would
make
a
nice
apertif
it
is
a
bit
too
mild
to
hold
its
own
against
food
it
wouldnt
ruin
most
dishes
but
most
dishes
would
ruin
this
beer
i
will
have
to
have
this
again
i
loko
forward
to
my
other
jolly
pumpkins
edit
the
first
time
i
tried
this
i
didnt
think
much
of
it
by
the
2nd
or
3rd
time
its
subtlety
was
clearly
its
strong
suit
and
i
find
myself
returning
to
it
again
and
again
for
a
good
thirstquencher
this
ale
has
expanded
my
understanding
of
this
style
this
brew
was
recommended
and
my
wife
and
i
were
not
that
impressed
poured
a
hazy
blond
w
a
creamy
white
1
inch
head
that
mostly
diminished
got
a
whiff
of
coriander
honey
and
some
smoke
elements
the
body
was
light
watery
and
very
fizzy
like
a
champagne
imo
and
my
wifes
opinion
there
is
to
much
involve
and
drank
like
a
champagne
although
we
finished
the
22
oz
bottle
it
was
a
hard
to
finish
for
those
out
there
hope
you
get
a
better
result
im
sold
on
trying
more
beers
in
the
jp
line
now
i
had
been
wary
of
them
before
because
of
the
funksour
descriptions
but
if
this
is
indicative
of
the
taste
id
like
some
more
please
6
50
12
oz
bottle
this
definitely
not
one
of
my
favorite
witbiers
just
too
damn
sour
like
lemonade
with
no
sugar
in
it
send
jolly
pumpkin
to
ca
this
one
was
really
impressive
i
must
say
that
at
first
the
mammoth
carbonation
was
really
disappointing
but
as
it
sat
it
dissipated
letting
me
have
a
more
intimate
experience
with
this
beer
drinkability
if
you
like
lemony
tart
witbiers
then
youll
love
this
beer
i
could
probably
see
myself
trying
this
one
again
a
beer
that
is
worthy
of
the
artwork
on
the
front
another
beer
that
i
was
glad
to
try
from
a
great
brewery
poured
a
hazy
peach
color
with
a
massive
white
chunky
head
that
threatened
to
and
did
escape
from
the
top
of
the
glass
beautiful
lacing
smell
is
mmainly
of
bananas
and
lemon
initial
smell
was
extremely
citrusy
and
tart
but
slowly
settled
to
be
extremely
pleasant
taste
is
a
delightful
mixture
of
bananas
cloves
and
tart
lemon
very
well
balanced
between
the
three
taste
sensations
with
each
taking
its
turn
to
dominate
great
drinking
beer
good
one
to
have
on
the
deck
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
my
first
beer
from
this
brewery
and
hopefully
not
my
last
d
light
and
tasty
this
is
one
witbier
i
could
drink
anytime
i
couldnt
pick
up
any
flavors
from
the
barrel
aging
but
im
not
complaining
not
overly
sweet
like
some
wits
il
be
looking
for
this
again
surely
a
fantastic
take
on
a

thank
you
tp
mlh1227
for
the
opportunity
to
try
this
cool
beer
mouthfeel
was
soft
and
easy
to
drink
very
drinkable
decent
example
of
a
belgian
white
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
in
the
great
pumpkin
charlie
brown
the
mystical
g
p
never
arrives
much
to
linuss
chagrin
in
the
jolly
pumpkins
world
its
the
pumpkin
ale
that
never
arrives
what
contrary
to
popular
belief
and
local
legend
these
guys
dont
put
out
a
brew
befitting
their
moniker
anywho
what
they
do
deliver
is
a
spicerack
bed
of
procrustes
of
the
few
ive
tried
at
the
brewery
from
the
tap
and
in
single
bottles
the
spices
override
the
smooth
creaminess
of
otherwise
excellent
beer
this
one
is
the
exception
so
far
theres
enough
tang
in
it
to
let
you
know
that
youve
been
with
a
tart
but
not
enough
spice
to
make
you
fret
that
you
have
been
infected
with
her
malty
infarction
scared
little
man
ish
kabibble
i
should
worry
no
not
me
a
fine
example
of
the
style
this
is
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
jolly
pumpkin
which
doesnt
say
much
as
it
stands
on
its
own
im
still
not
compelled
to
buy
this
again
with
hoegarrden
celis
white
and
holy
moses
readily
available
this
is
a
much
cleaner
brew
than
those
ive
had
before
from
j
p
which
seem
to
suffer
from
being
fermented
much
too
warm
drinkability
i
think
with
jp
beers
theres
the
chance
for
em
to
get
a
bit
on
the
sour
side
but
when
the
sourness
is
subdued
a
bit
this
beer
is
a
great
summer
beer
refreshing
light
and
tasty
cant
go
wrong
there
edit
i
am
now
most
of
the
way
through
the
6pack
and
i
find
that
i
am
enjoying
it
less
as
time
goes
on
still
a
good
brew
but
i
just
am
not
finding
the
drinkability
to
be
that
high
scores
adjusted
accordingly
pale

full
creamy

with

wonderful

lemony

attempt
at
the
style
as
usual
a
brew
that
drinks
easily
and
is
great
for
warm
weather
body
is
a
bit
overlycarbonated
leading
to
some
foam
in
the
mouth
if
not
sipped
carefully
overall
an
excellent
thirstquenching
beer
thats
great
for
summer
but
probably
delicious
any
day
bottle
courtesy
of
thebeercellar2
pour
a
yellow
ale
with
some
white
haze
and
a
big
foamy
head
with
perfect
retention
aroma
of
brettanomyces
was
overly
dominant
and
left
little
space
for
the
coriander
and
orange
peel
that
were
advertised
on
the
label
taste
is
also
dominated
by
the
brettanomyces
with
some
hints
of
coriander
and
wheat
body
is
definitely
above
average
for
the
style
and
that
made
it
pretty
enjoyable
im
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
beer
since
im
not
sure
the
brett
was
planned
to
be
there
but
it
didnt
stop
my
enjoyment
of
the
beer
this
is
easily
the
finest
american
white
ive
come
upon
pours
pale
cloudy
yellow
with
floating
sediment
big
thin
soapy
white
head
that
quickly
devolves
to
foam
and
medium
lace
smells
of
fresh
hops
coarse
grain
curacao
orange
and
creamy
wheat
wellspritzed
lemon
lime
and
powdery
yeast
at
the
front
of
the
mouth
rounded
coriander
and
orange
at
the
center
that
persists
through
sweet
and
sour
finish
could
use
a
bit
more
dryness
in
the
finish
a
bit
too
highly
carbonated
in
the
mouth
but
pleasantly
creamy
from
the
wheat
drinkability
pretty
good
example
of
a
wit
bit
of
an
odd
flavor
though
still
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
day
the
finish
is
dry
and
only
slightly
acidic
with
another
round
of
lemon
and
orange
peel
all
is
well
except
for
that
slight
tang
of
metal
mixing
with
the
lemon
on
the
fade
if
you
like
sour
beers
you
should
like
this
interpretation
of
the
wirbier
style
notes
easy
drinker
may
not
be
for
everyone
as
it
puckers
ya
up
now
and
again
please
keep
sending
your
beer
our
way
jolly
pumpkin
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
the
carbonation
was
high
this
beer
was
very
drinkable
and
would
make
an
excellent
summertime
quencher
where
full
flavor
was
a
requirement
the
style
is
well
captured
here
but
with
some
strong
detractors
just
expect
a
bit
of
funkiness
with
some
tart
jp
brews
always
seem
to
have
a
bit
of
a
unique
edge
to
the
style
which
they
attempt
which
draws
me
to
their
brews
i
think
they
are
easily
approachable
for
one
getting
into
beers
fermented
with
some
natural
bacteria
overall
tasty
stuff
no
doubt
but
a
little
light
on
the
body
and
just
way
too
perfumery
to
be
sessionable
as
a
wit
should
be
not
a
bad
effort
all
round
but
rather
unbalanced
a
witty
thanks
to
my
mate
minnesotajoe
for
this
one
feisty
stuff
this
jp
but
this
one
is
a
little
out
of
control
and
needs
to
calm
down
a
bit
d
excellent
white
this
is
what
a
great
but
delicate
beer
tastes
like
highly
carbonated
yellow
body
with
a
tall
white
head
and
great
lacing
smells
of
subtle
sweet
malts
taste
is
mellow
but
complex
smooth
malts
give
way
to
corriander
and
vanilla
followed
by
citrus
and
hop
bitterness
light
on
the
palate
and
very
satisfying
a
different
but
amazing
wit
lemony
belgian
yeast
aromalots
of
esters
easy
to
see
how
the
style
came
to
be
known
as
wit
looking
at
the
body
and
color
nice
to
see
what
a
good
brewery
can
do
with
a
style
that
is
normally
soft
and
timid
all
the
spicey
orangelemon
corriander
and
tang
of
the
best
wits
youve
had
only
amped
up
thanks
to
chris
at
murrays
for
this
beauty
mouthfeel
is
extremely
light
leaving
nothing
behind
where
this
detracts
somewhat
from
the
mouthfeel
portion
it
makes
this
brew
that
much
more
drinkable
not
sour
not
crazy
funky
just
a
nice
simple
wit
with
some
incredibly
interesting
complexity
tossed
in
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
rather
than
a
sixer
an
experiment
gone
bad
in
my
opinion
not
what
im
looking
for
in
a
whit
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
pale
yellowwhite
color
the
head
is
massive
creamy
and
white
the
aroma
of
oranges
with
a
bit
of
coriander
in
the
background
and
an
overall
tartness
the
taste
is
of
juicy
oranges
and
is
very
tart
i
think
i
might
even
detect
some
bretta
at
work
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
overall
this
may
not
be
a
great
representation
of
a
witbier
but
it
is
a
great
representation
of
a
very
good
beer
i
think
this
just
might
become
my
beer
for
this
coming
summer
yellow
partially
orangish
appearance
translucent
with
a
slightly
cloudy
sense
good
head
of
over
14
of
an
inch
and
leaving
nice
complete
laces
on
the
glass
aroma
is
interesting
quite
yeasty
with
astringent
notes
and
underlying
spice
a
little
sourish
overall
for
a
wit
light
and
airy
body
medium
carbonation
seems
a
little
creamy
and
doughy
like
a
powderedsugar
doughnut
or
those
small
round
lemon
cookies
in
a
box
backed
up
by
the
more
sharp
aroma
decently
dry
in
the
finish
but
then
a
little
different
seems
a
little
fragmented
without
the
more
integrated
spicey
estery
flow
of
many
beers
in
this
style
cloudy
yellow
beer
with
an
orange
tint
to
it
fluffy
snow
white
cap
of
froth
carbonation
looks
to
be
healthy
from
the
appearance
this
shows
great
retention
and
substantial
lacing
ability
fresh
aroma
of
doughy
yeast
poundcake
pepper
lemon
zest
and
spices
almost
more
of
a
tripel
kind
of
aroma
than
witbier
but
quite
good
nonetheless
this
interpretation
of
witbier
is
quite
dry
and
more
tart
than
most
and
the
orange
and
corriander
and
sweetness
are
less
prevalent
leathery
tart
lemon
qualities
preside
as
well
as
earthy
and
musty
yeastiness
herbal
hops
add
a
bit
of
character
carbontion
is
uplifting
body
is
close
to
medium
this
is
a
good
beer
even
if
its
a
witbier
that
smells
like
a
tripel
and
tastes
like
a
biere
de
garde
hazy
yellow
color
lofty
foam
light
spice
orange
peel
coriander
with
hints
of
banana
wheat
malt
and
butter
toffee
in
the
nose
fairly
pleasant
tasting
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
raw
spicing
yet
another
approachable
witbier
but
if
this
were
a
little
stronger
and
more
flavorful
it
could
be
so
much
better
pale
yellow
with
light
haze
and
a
frothy
white
head
very
nice
aroma
mellow
wheat
a
little
pepper
and
coriander
along
with
some
orange
zest
mild
sweetness
with
citrusy
lemon
and
a
light
acidity
that
just
borders
on
vinegar
also
a
bit
of
mineral
character
light
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
dry
finish
quite
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
750
ml
bottle
calabaza
blanca
pours
out
a
slightly
hazy
yellow
color
topped
with
a
very
large
white
head
the
neck
of
the
bottle
was
coated
in
brown
film
which
i
suppose
is
yeast
lots
of
lacing
forms
on
the
side
of
my
glass
as
i
drink
this
beer
the
aroma
is
spicy
and
fruity
with
coriander
pineapple
orange
and
lemon
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
the
addition
of
ginger
finishes
with
a
tangy
acidic
flavor
carbonation
is
very
high
good
drinkability
a
bit
odd
for
a
witbier
but
an
enjoyable
flavor
nonetheless
d
i
liked
this
beer
much
more
this
time
that
last
time
i
think
this
beer
is
all
about
the
nuances
the
soft
flavors
give
no
room
for
flaws
and
when
they
all
come
together
they
have
a
nice
smooth
complexity
to
a
session
beer
but
this
is
more
than
a
session
beer
in
that
i
have
to
focus
on
the
mysterious
flavors
and
try
to
describe
what
i
am
tasting
very
interesting
and
very
delicious
another
michigan
micro
that
is
a
bit
more
of
a
muddled
mess
than
a
success
in
my
opinion
i
long
for
the
lagers
of
wisconsin
that
i
grew
up
with
this
poured
with
a
light
white
head
that
maintained
decent
retention
the
beer
was
a
beautifully
clear
goldenyellow
color
and
the
nose
had
a
sour
apple
smell
to
it
very
reminiscent
of
the
firefly
it
was
hugely
effervescent
almost
like
champagne
in
the
mouth
i
noticed
a
lot
of
overlapping
flavors
on
the
palate
including
apples
brett
a
subtle
oakiness
and
a
lemony
tartness
the
finish
was
very
dry
with
a
subtle
mustiness
lingering
more
please
sir
d
very
nice
incredibly
refreshing
a
great
summer
beer
drinkability
the
ale
is
relatively
low
in

and
would
be
perfect
for

thanks
drjay
awesome
d
this
is
a
refreshingly
tart
drink
that
would
be
awesomely
suited
to
accompany
food
alone
its
also
pleasing
but
not
as
easy
a
drinker
as
i
would
have
hoped
personally
i
like
my
witbiers
a
bit
more
rounded
and
less
upfront
the
head
was
out
of
control
like
a
looney
out
of
the
bin
upon
my
pour
lots
of
sediment
floating
around
color
is
pale
gold
i
can
smell
a
mixture
of
spice
and
lemon
and
orange
peel
tastes
mostly
of
lemon
and
spice
and
maybe
a
hint
of
apple
juice
very
crisp
and
refreshing
i
could
see
this
quenching
my
thirst
very
well
on
a
hot
day
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
many

interesting
and
enjoyable
enough
to
continually
revisit
this
is
the
first
beer
ive
ever
had
by
jolly
pumpkin
its
very
tasty
full
of
flavor
and
has
a
wonderful
aroma
ill
be
picking
up
some
more
jolly
pumpkin
beers
to
try
real
soon
from
the
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
that
left
a
lot
of
lacing
aroma
wheat
lemon
sweet

when
it
warms
up
a
little
some
sourness
comes
out

first
impression
very
light
and
refreshing
lemon
wheat
citrus
sugar
a
nice
dry
finish
second
impression
very
light
and
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
went
very
well
with
my
shrimp
stir
fry
will
get
more
of
this
still
there
is
a
very
pleasing
aftertaste
to
this
that
sticks
with
you
and
compells
you
to
drink
more
taste
initiialy
the
citric
flavors
really
stand
out
with
the
lemon
and
orange
after
a
few
sips
a
bit
of
vanilla
and
a
woody
presence
show
up
with
a
nice
drying
spiciness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
one
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
clear
gold
almost
lagerish
appearance
the
white
head
hangs
around
for
a
bit
then
collapses
to
a
ring
plenty
of
bubbly
carbonation
nose
is
odd
mix
of
sugar
vanilla
fake
banana
odor
taste
is
just
as
strange
with
a
base
of
rubber
band
and
club
soda
with
some
yeast
and
wheat
malt
thrown
in
but
it
just
isnt
enough
to
overcome
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
ok
medium
i
cant
get
past
the
flavor
this
is
my
second
jolly
pumpkin
that
has
disappointed
the
roja
was
the
other
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
i
found
it
to
be
a
bit
of
a
change
of
pace
the
more
i
drink
the
more
i
like
it
drinkability
is
good
on
this
slightly
sour
jolly
pumpkin
offering
this
is
a
wellmade
polished
beer
that
i
can
really
respect
though
the
appearance
and
feel
are
perfect
the
smells
and
flavor
profile
are
pretty
good
should
be
enjoyed
with
food
as
the
tartness
cuts
through
most
things
including
this
tasty
roasted
garlic
cheddar
very
very
smooth
flavor
and
feel
and
an
overall
nice
beer

a

with

dense

almost
looks

has
to
be
the
whitest

i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
phenolic
and
spicy
aromacould
use
a

more
depth
to
it
tart
and
phenolic
flavor
a
very
mild
trace
of
spices
finshes
quite
dry
though
refreshing
very
bright
and
lively
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
good
beer
could
stand
to
be
kicked
up
a
notch
in
the
body
and
flavor
and
i
think
youd
have
one
hell
of
a
beer
first
time
i
have
heard
from
this
brewery
and
i
hope
to
see
more
theres
a
lot
of
potential
here
and
with
a
little
tweaking
this
could
be
a
topnotch
and
highly
complex
brew
as
of
today
its
not
there
yet
a
very
complex
and
experimental
witbier
a
lot
going
on
aromas
are
very
spicy
citrusy
yeasty
bready
and
musky
with
a
touch
of
tartness
that
boarders
on
sour
looks
a
hazy
straw
with
an
abundance
of
carbonation
and
laces
very
well
an
alternating
play
of
tart
lemons
and
grapefruit
with
sweet
oranges
and
wheat
malt
swirl
around
a
solid
dosing
of
hops
a
moderate
base
of
barley
malt
gives
a
bready
yeasty
and
a
light
grain
flavor
spices
of
corriander
and
curraco
play
on
the
toung
high
carbonation
gives
a
creamy
texture
less
thin
than
expected
finishes
dry
and
quite
chardonaylike
muskiness
continues
lightly
sweet
and
bitter
with
a
light
grainy
bite
in
the
throat
still
refreshing
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
a
very
nice
brew
for
the
warmer
weather
having
picked
this
up
on
a
recent
trip
to
orlando
i
was
hesitant
to
keep
it
until
next
summer
a
very
intriguing
wit
from
a
brewer
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
something
different
from
the
usual
witbier
interesting
interplay
of
dryness
and
a
citric
tartness
that
borders
on
a
berliner
weiss
lactic
acidity
quite
smooth
with
the
spicing
rather
reserved
for
the
style
which
is
rather
nice
given
that
so
many
go
to
excess
of
orange
and
coriander
some
whitewine
sweetness
is
present
toward
the
end
but
it
dries
up
for
a
very
crisp
finish
another
excellent
oak
aged
artisan
ale
from
the
jolly
pumpkin
folks
this
one
is
as
well
crafted
as
their
higher
alcohol
releases
and
more
of
a
quaffer
excellent
any
time
of
the
year
but
this
would
be
an
exceptional
summer
ale
its
gaseous
lighthearted
and
plenty
drinkable
a
solid
standardissue
satisfying
in
every
category
i
almost
wish
it
wasnt
october
now
but
rather
somewhere
in
the
heat
of
july
so
this
was
put
to
better
use
either
way
its
a
fine
beer
that
really
puts
out
picked
up
a
lot
more
vanilla
and
oak
in
the
flavor
over
last
few
samplings
fills
the
mouth
with
tiny
champagne
like
bubblesin
a
good
way
finishes
semidry
and
refreshing
stupendous
this
is
my
favorite
american
wit
and
one
of
my
favorite
brews
everytime
i
have
it
i
find
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
and
a
solid
brew
that
impresses
every
time
do
yourself
a
favor
and
pick
up
some
of
this
brew
beer
is
good
happy
beering
pours
a
nice
pale
yellow
color
with
a
3
finger
head
that
falls
to
a
light
coating
over
top
good
looking
brew
the
nose
is
very
nice
light
lemon
and
stronger
orange
notes
maybe
a
touch
of
chamomile
in
there
too
adding
to
the
spicey
character
i
pick
up
i
really
like
the
aroma
the
flavor
is
much
more
lemony
than
the
nose
the
lemon
fades
to
a
light
orange
and
a
moderate
spiceyness
but
the
lemon
is
very
forward
i
like
it
but
would
like
to
see
a
little
less
lemon
and
more
orange
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
thick
with
a
healthy
carbonation
overall
a
nice
brew
the
flavor
is
a
bit
off
for
my
taste
but
otherwise
it
it
solid
pours
a
cloudy
yellow
color
with
a
tall
head
that
has
nice
retention
and
leaves
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
has
a
lot
of
citrus
mostly
lemony
and
a
little
grainy
the
flavor
is
a
little
wheaty
but
it
has
a
lot
of
citruslemon
stuff
going
on
the
lemon
lends
itself
to
giving
the
beer
a
little
bit
of
sour
flavor
but
not
in
a
bad
way
this
is
an
interesting
witbier
very
different
than
most
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thick
end
of
moderate
and
the
drinkability
is
good
points
for
being
extra
interesting
on
this
one
label
claims
outstanding
depth
refreshing
yes
outstanding
depth
uhh
no
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
an
abundance
of
fast
moving
carbonation
that
rushes
across
the
mouth
slightly
dry
and
crisp
very
refreshing
this
is
definetly
a
nice
summertime
brew
and
an
enjoyable
witbier
im
glad
that
jolly
pumpkin
has
found
its
way
down
to
illinois
now
and
thanks
to
marburg
for
this
bottle
im
sampling
today
very
complex
and
spicy
and
i
think
a
lot
of
potential
lurks
underneath
yet
another
great
jolly
pumpkin
beer
750ml
bottle
appears
a
cloudy
gold
with
tall
white
foamy
head
some
scattered
lace
was
left
as
the
head
settled
in
some
spices
and
light
fruit
melon
lemon
came
out
first
there
was
some
light
sweetness
there
as
well
the
flavor
was
similar
with
a
variety
of
spices
complimenting
the
fruit
notes
of
lemon
pear
and
some
doughy
malt
finishes
up
with
a
light
spice
and
sweetness
pretty
solid
mouthfeel
on
this
easily
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
tasty
version
of
the
style
even
if
its
a
bit
less
complex
than
others
good
stuff
to
try
on
someone
you
are
trying
to
convert
to
good
beer
pretty
good
stuff
a
little
out
of
the
realm
of
most
witbiers
but
likeable
and
damn
drinkable
all
the
same
at
first
i
was
skeptical
but
its
mild
complexity
grew
on
me
good
thing
this
comes
in
a
bomber
otherwise
12oz
may
not
have
been
enough
to
get
a
full
scope
of
its
easy
goin
drinkin
character
thanks
tr
the
drinkability
is
good
with
the
relatively
low
alcohol
content
and
the
less
than
hefty
yet
satisfying
weight
of
flavour
and
body
more
flavour
would
not
be
unwelcome
but
this
is
still
very
nice
nonetheless
i
am
sure
this
brew
is
precisely
what
the
brewer
had
in
mind
so
my
opinion
is
just
that
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
very
unique
and
enjoyable
witbier
witbiers
tend
to
get
old
after
a
while
and
this
one
is
a
diamond
in
the
rough
unique
and
definitly
worth
a
shot
one
of
the
more
perfect
summer
beers
ive
had
all
season
a
topnotch
effort
from
a
brewery
to
keep
your
eye
on
drinkability
is
good
a
very
nice
witbier
supplied
by
a
very
nice
ba
brian700
thanks
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
and
a
nice
refreshing
one
for
a
hot
day
i
cant
say
that
its
something
id
keep
coming
back
to
unless
i
get
more
into
tart
beers
the
low
alcohol
makes
this
a
good
quaffer
but
not
something
id
rush
out
to
get
again
hazy
golden
in
pour
with
an
orangish
type
highlight
on
the
sides
nicely
carbonated
but
not
overly
so
medium
white
head
holds
for
a
bit
but
ultimately
reduces
to
nearly
nothing
actually
a
little
more
carbonation
might
be
alright
aroma
is
notable
of
the
spices
im
getting
a
good
amount
of
coriander
in
the
smell
less
orange
peel
or
citric
qualites
theres
a
nice
fruity
flavor
in
there
as
well
as
a
bit
of
cider
taste
has
a
lot
of
complexity
spices
are
reduced
to
simply
being
spices
which
i
like
nice
thick
creamy
body
for
a
wit
holds
a
sweet
malt
like
flavor
followed
by
a
drying
yeasty
precense
light
acidity
is
there
but
the
finish
is
really
dry
and
lingers
orange
is
weak
and
so
is
lemon
in
comparison
to
other
wits
i
like
that
really
the
oak
again
really
adds
body
and
depth
to
this
beer
i
think
really
well
done
seems
more
artisinal
than
some
of
the
authentic
artisinal
beers
maybe
not
the
most
juicy
and
thirst
quenching
beer
however
finger
licking
good
poured
into
a
rapscallion
glass
formed
2
of
white
head
over
the
bright
straw
brew
head
snowcones
over
the
top
of
the
glass
due
to
the
flurry
of
bubbles
eminating
form
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
laves
with
beautiful
heavy
foam
aroma
is
a
light
tart
spiciness
taste
as
well
starts
with
a
tartness
then
mellows
out
with
soft
wheat
coating
the
tongue
and
closes
with
a
dry
crispness
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
and
smooth
with
immensely
easy
drinkability
a
nice
postlawnmowing
brew
today
after
being
out
in
the
heat
my
first
beer
from
the
guys
at
jolly
pumpkin
poured
out
to
a
heavily
carbonated
slighly
golden
color
nice
long
lived
white
bubbly
head
was
rather
unexpected
yet
still
appreciated
aromas
of
ginger
herbs
and
spices
were
noted
as
were
notes
of
apple
cider
and
fruits
the
taste
was
initally
kind
of
bland
and
actually
quite
dissapointing
then
this
brew
really
opens
up
well
around
the
2nd
glass
from
the
750ml
bottle
flavors
of
tangerine
and
citrus
are
most
presents
then
a
breadyeast
like
flavor
rears
its
head
herbs
and
spices
are
also
noted
and
the
entire
time
the
brew
was
in
my
mouth
the
carbonation
added
to
the
crispness
of
the
flavors
finshed
slighly
malty
with
a
smooth
bitterness
i
now
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
brews
from
jolly
pumpkin
recommended
carbonation
level
is
probably
a
bit
low
for
style
but
helps
increase
the
thirstquenching
properties
of
the
beer
this
is
eminently
drinkable
i
opened
it
for
dinner
but
it
was
gone
before
the
meat
and
veggies
were
off
the
grill
which
actually
may
say
as
much
about
me
as
the
beer
overall
the
smell
of
this
one
is
really
the
only
thing
that
i
wasnt
happy
with
this
one
is
very
drinkable
smooth
and
pretty
enjoyable
mild
light
highly
carbonated
these
arent
usually
characteristics
that
find
a
great
deal
of
favor
with
me
having
said
that
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
and
is
insanely
easy
to
drink
in
the
end
white
gourd
isnt
as
impressive
as
its
very
impressive
bottle
and
label
would
lead
one
to
believe
i
still
have
high
hopes
for
the
other
jolly
pumpkin
ales
though
thanks
to
deejaydan
for
the
bottle
i
must
say
i
am
always
happy
with
the
small
michigan
belgian
brewery
with
spanish
names
for
its
beers
this
could
be
a
good
drink
for
hanging
out
on
a
deck
on
a
hot
august
evening
a
real
thirst
quencher
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
belgian
wits
that
i
have
had
i
am
a
sucker
for
a
good
wit
but
i
think
that
this
has
struck
a
really
nice
balance
it
is
bright
citrusy
and
quite
refreshing
yet
it
has
some
subtle
complexity
to
it
but
not
so
much
that
it
gets
in
the
way
of
this
beer
being
refreshing
like
it
should
hopefully
the
barrels
that
this
beer
is
aged
in
will
be
properly
inoculated
because
this
could
use
a
bit
more
funky
complexity
to
it
that
would
definitely
make
this
beer
perfection
in
the
glass
come
late
spring
to
summer
time
this
is
by
far
the
best
beer
from
jolly
pumpkin
that
i
have
had
this
is
in
fact
just
a
world
class
example
of
this
style
and
i
hope
this
brewery
can
get
their
barrels
going
such
that
all
of
their
beers
can
get
to
this
level
nice
cloudy
gold
rather
dark
for
a
white
beer
gentle
meringous
head
sticking
to
the
edges
incredible
spicy
aroma
executed
with
grace
it
seems
so
easy
this
is
troubling
firm
ginger
roots
fresh
ginseng
mellow
coriander
and
a
touch
of
lemon
and
vanilla
combine
into
the
most
gracious
offering
the
closest
one
i
can
think
of
would
be
hitachinos
but
more
subtle
and
elegant
like
a
spice
mousse
fluffy
unfortunately
the
flavor
doesnt
quite
hold
up
though
its
still
far
better
than
most
contenders
in
the
style
it
is
surprisingly
bitter
and
has
a
sharp
sourvinous
middle
with
rhubarb
ginger
and
cranberry
notes
i
dont
find
the
same
coherence
than
in
the
aroma
but
this
may
be
due
to
the
agressive
carbonation
full
of
big
bubbles
which
somehow
detracts
a
bit
nonetheless
a
stunning
take
on
a
witbier
worldclass
and
beyond
aroma
i
was
quite
excited
to
see
this
beer
in
the
beer
store
after
reading
about
jolly
pumpkin
in
teh
michigan
beer
guide
this
is
my
very
first
experience
with
them
they
seem
highly
rated
but
im
not
digging
on
this
beer
all
too
much
its
good
but
im
not
going
rush
out
ot
make
sure
i
have
another
stowed
away
this
beer
pours
a
deep
golden
honey
color
very
nice
head
formation
that
slinks
away
as
you
drink
didnt
notice
exceptional
lacing
but
it
was
there
spicy
flavor
with
hints
of
lemon
and
pineapple
very
malty
reminded
me
of
a
nice
belgian
dubbel
noticed
a
lot
of
sediment
in
the
bottle
most
likely
due
to
the
barrel
aging
overall
jolly
pumpkin
is
doing
some
good
things
with
beer
and
should
be
applauded
for
it
imaginative
name
and
bottle
i
liked
this
mellow
wheat
beer
but
only
as
a
share
of
a
onetime
bottle
carbonation
on
tongue
with
lemon
and
bitterness
in
there
corriander
ginger
and
spices
moderated
by
malt
dose
thanks
to
wohlfs
for
shlepping
to
doug
shoemakers
super
tasting
drinkability
is
very
high
wellcrafted
with
excellent
flavor
and
feel
on
the
palate
cheers
to
ron
jeffries
for
another
fantastic
beer
from
what
ive
called
the
best
new
brewery
of
2004
a
wit
that
doesnt
try
to
be
demure
but
wears
its
flavors
out
on
its
sleeves
and
certainly
one
ill
get
in
my
future
trips
to
michigan
and
hopefully
someday
around
here
pours
a
straw
yellw
with
a
thin
film
of
white
foam
decent
carbonation
but
next
to
no
head
aroma
is
fruity
and
very
sweet
with
the
typical
belguan
aroma
flavor
is
sweet
and
lemony
with
a
spicy
peppery
touch
just
a
touch
of
tangy
bitterness
at
the
end
bringing
a
dry
finish
to
the
light
bready
malt
easy
drinking
great
session
beer
pours
a
light
golden
in
color
a
white
pillowy
head
develops
aroma
is
of
lemons
and
maybe
freshly
mown
grass
with
some
spices
first
sip
reveals
a
orangey
and
lemon
taste
with
very
slight
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
a
very
fine
example
of
witbier
the
only
thing
i
mark
down
slightly
is
the
mouthfeel
which
is
so
light
that
the
beer
just
floats
on
the
tongue
and
feels
a
little
watery
easy
to
drink
im
glad
this
is
in
jolly
pumpkins
arsenal
pours
out
to
a
vibrant
gold
to
almost
orange
in
the
glass
with
quite
a
large
head
the
aroma
is
fragrant
with
citrus
especially
a
light
lemon
and
bread
dough
coming
forth
the
taste
is
good
with
a
light
spice
on
the
tongue
that
show
off
hints
of
citrus
and
malt
that
gives
way
to
an
easy
finish
that
seems
mild
yet
complex
at
the
same
time
this
is
a
very
easy
to
to
drink
beer
and
definetely
the
session
beer
of
the
jolly
pumpkin
line
pungent
citrus
aroma
lemon
and
dried
orange
peel
but
baby
powder
coriander
and
a
mild
breadcrust
smell
make
themselves
known
as
well
a
creamy
yeasty
body
houses
more
citrus
and
corriander
and
notes
of
orange
candy
ive
had
this
three
times
now
and
while
im
confident
the
basic
flavors
and
aromas
have
stayed
constant
my
overall
impression
keeps
changing
from
good
to
spectacular
to
good
wits
strike
me
as
a
very
temperature
and
mood
dependant
beer
and
this
is
no
exception
at
times
it
seems
mild
at
other
times
it
screams
out
to
me
a
wellexecuted
beer
this
resides
at
one
pole
of
the
wit
spectrum
big
earthy
and
exotic
less
hoegaarden
and
more
st
bernardus
if
you
will
