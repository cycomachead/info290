my
wifes
family
came
in
to
town
and
i
found
myself
cooking
sunday
brunch
for
em
all
my
brother
in
law
brought
an
ice
cold
12
pack
of
these
and
we
just
sort
of
started
drinking
them
there
is
a
slight
metallic
or
artificial
taste
that
sort
of
hinders
the
appleyness
of
this
beer
is
it
really
beer
but
on
the
plus
side
they
go
down
pretty
fast
after
a
two
or
three
of
them
in
the
morning
who
cares
however
after
giving
it
our
hardest
and
deciding
to
dump
it
down
our
semiclogged
drain
the
drain
is
no
longer
clogged
i
suppose
it
does
have
some
use
after
all
found
this
in
my
local
stores
bargain
cart
no
bins
only
carts
yes
shopping
carts
so
i
figured
id
give
it
a
shot
for
the
hell
of
it
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
shortlived
dirtywhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
bushels
of
apples
some
of
them
seemingly
artificial
some
seemingly
genuine
some
sweet
some
sourleaning
cider
style
baby
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
a
hint
of
booze
occasionally
making
itself
evident
theres
a
bit
of
corn
syrup
foundationing
the
situation
as
well
if
you
catch
my
drift
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
not
a
bad
vehicle
for
booze
delivery
really
thoroughly
reminiscent
of
a
thickerthanusual
cider
and
totally
drinkable
and
no
ive
got
no
remote
fucking
affiliation
with
the
company
i
know
what
you
cock
suckers
are
like
so
dont
even
think
you
can
dismiss
my
review
that
way
fuckin
shaft
swallowers
overall
again
not
the
worst
thing
ever
its
just
not
beer
by
any
stretch
im
very
picky
with
my
beer
i
do
not
like
most
hoppy
flavors
of
beer
that
fills
you
up
quick
also
many
beer
makes
me
burp
real
bad
my
usual
staple
is
yuengling
but
for
a
beer
thats
nothing
like
a
beer
i
absolutely
love
redds
wicked
i
live
in
delaware
and
this
stuff
sells
out
all
the
time
this
is
the
best
stuff
around
my
friends
and
i
all
love
it
nasty
just
plain
nasty
taste
like
perfume
dont
buy
people
that
rate
it
poorly
are
snobs
its
darn
refreshing
this
coming
from
a
craft
beer
snob
i
make
an
exception
for
redds
poured
from
a
10
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
of
apple
juice
taste
is
apples
sweet
some
alcohol
is
present
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
a
notch
of
other
redds
beers
i
have
had
high
alcohol
content
is
the
only
thing
going
in
here
gross
o
eh
refreshingly
hard
no
surprises
here
overall
this
is
pretty
much
apple
juice
and
everclear
its
not
a
bad
summer
beer
even
if
the
fruitiness
makes
it
seem
a
lot
more
like
a
cider
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentyfour
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall

this
is
proof
a
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
world
class
in
every
category
or
even
one
to
be
enjoyable
this
is
an
example
of
a
beer
that
i
enjoy
that
is
absolutely
mediocre
or
less
in
every
category
its
very
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
while
maintaining
an
alcoholic
burn
its
better
than
abs
limearitas
pours
a
pretty
amber
in
color
with
no
head
but
does
have
some
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
fresh
apples
and
lots
of
them
with
some
malt
liquor
as
well
pretty
much
same
for
the
taste
nice
and
crisp
not
as
sweet
as
you
might
think
but
good
lighter
bodied
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
way
to
easy
overall
it
was
tasty
and
sometimes
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
cider
d
i
like
to
change
it
up
now
and
then
with
some
low
brow
brew
i
also
enjoy
cider
which
this
is
meant
to
mimic
okay
plus
for
what
it
is
i
would
pick
this
over
regular
redds
apple
ale
so
all
that
being
said
it
actually
is
somewhat
enjoyable
its
definitely
more
of
a
hard
cider
than
an
ale
like
it
claims
to
be
and
id
prefer
angry
orchard
or
original
redds
but
its
not
that
bad
the
taste
is
actually
very
good
sour
and
crisp
the
aftertaste
is
just
a
bit
much
its
like
they
injected
extra
alcohol
into
each
can
just
for
the
sake
of
high
schoolers
who
want
something
cheap
to
get
drunk
on
but
id
buy
it
again
if
it
was
on
sale
i
wanted
to
write
a
review
for
this
because
i
felt
that
many
people
prior
had
the
assumption
that
this
drink
is
something
that
it
is
not
clearly
we
cannot
compare
this
redds
to
heady
topper
or
any
other
traditionally
brewed
beer
for
that
matter
but
it
really
succeeds
at
doing
what
it
has
attempted
to
do
plainly
this
is
an
unoffensive
and
easy
drinking
alternative
to
traditional
beer
i
really
cant
get
over
the
fact
that
people
keep
deriding
this
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
too
sweet
since
it
actually
has
the
same
or
less
calories
per
abv
than
other
options
in
its
alcohol
class
consequently
i
would
categorize
this
sweetness
as
more
of
a
sour
taste
and
i
think
it
is
much
more
comparable
to
a
granny
smith
apple
taste
than
a
traditional
red
in
the
end
when
i
want
to
switch
things
up
from
drinking
multiple
craft
beers
this
redds
provides
great
taste
while
very
effectively
masking
its
high
alcohol
content
it
is
by
no
means
perfect
but
i
would
certainly
reach
for
a
redds
over
any
of
the
myriad
of
competing
adjunct
lagers
considering
that
it
effectively
brings
a
unique
change
of
pace
to
the
table
poured
into
a
fancy
tulip
glass
clear
light
amber
color
no
head
at
all
smells
like
apples
soaked
in
everclear
taste
like
apples
i
actually
enjoy
this
not
kidding
perfect
getting
drunk
drink
dont
really
consider
it
a
beer
though
not
much
ale
to
it
a
candy
apple
malt
liquor
character
is
pretty
much
what
it
is
i
scored
with
what
it
is
in
mind
and
still
was
less
than
impressed
its
more
of
a
sweet
malt
beverage
than
a
beer
in
my
opinion
really
not
too
bad
at
all
8
abv
but
i
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
color
is
a
pretty
nice
light
gold
with
some
tannishlight
brown
hues
no
head
or
lacing
smell
is
of
straight
apple
cider
taste
is
bold
and
hits
you
quickly
with
a
crisp
apple
cider
sweet
apple
juice
flavor
as
i
said
can
barely
taste
the
alcohol
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
high
and
the
mf
is
a
bit
thinl
other
than
that
its
pretty
decent
probably
will
buy
again
tastes
like
a
tasteful
orchard
of
tasty
appleness
i
am
no
drinker
of
apple
brews
as
of
the
late
trend
to
be
that
has
revived
the
lost
apple
cider
trend
that
has
died
and
rotted
away
seemingly
in
a
deserving
fashion
i
am
just
not
but
this
this
affordable
concoction
delicious
perfection
it
is
good
as
the
drinker
of
ailments
that
i
am
ive
offered
a
little
of
my
time
to
this
trend
of
sorts
to
see
what
these
ciders
and
ales
bring
to
the
table
most
have
disappointed
and
sickened
me
including
wasted
my
time
and
money
that
couldve
been
merely
doubled
for
a
hopsy
i
p
a
then
i
picked
this
one
up
at
a
gas
station
2
37
it
was
warm
put
it
on
ice
it
tastes
like
a
tangy
apple
cider
that
is
what
it
should
taste
like
if
you
drink
apple
cider
do
you
feel
anything
but
loneliness
and
high
blood
sugar
then
dont
expect
much
more
with
this
witchly
brew
of
high
it
is
cheap
apple
couch
syrup
that
is
satisfying
to
anyone
who
is
sick
minded
enough
to
try
it
and
even
sicker
to
complain
about
it
not
likely
to
be
purchasing
again
tastes
ok
first
few
sips
then
a
malt
liquor
headache
2
hours
later
i
knew
better
overall
a
super
sweet
on
the
somewhat
cloying
side
hard
cider
with
the
lightest
touch
of
ale
and
i
mean
very
light
just
a
sweeter
boozier
and
more
cidery
version
of
the
original
redds
redds
x
1
5
overall
why
is
there
a
market
for
this
why
wouldnt
miller
just
make
a
real
cider
the
apple
ale
craze
will
be
short
lived
like
hard
lemonade
and
spiked
tea
rjt
redds
wicked
ale
pours
an
off
red
color
with
no
head
and
a
lot
of
bubbles
there
is
a
mellow
apple
like
aroma
the
taste
is
very
sweet
with
a
very
candy
like
a
fake
apple
flavor
nicely
carbonated
but
awful
flavors
come
through
overall
it
has
a
lot
of
fake
flavors
and
is
more
offensive
then
anything
redds
wicked
ale
will
inevitably
have
its
haters
but
frankly
this
is
an
appetizing
offering
far
more
successful
at
delivering
what
youd
expect
than
the
new
bud
light
lime
appleahhhrita
while
its
thickness
and
highsugar
content
may
hinder
ones
choice
in
a
second
or
third
beverage
unlike
with
the
brands
traditional
line
theres
little
to
complain
about
here
a
solid
offering
and
a
respectable
contributor
to
a
brand
i
hope
continues
to
grow
with
the
promise
it
bears
early
on
publix
had
2
24
oz
cans
for
3
bucks
how
can
you
pass
that
up
i
didnt
see
the
8
abv
till
i
got
home
so
i
let
them
chill
for
2
days
i
poured
half
a
can
into
a
samuel
adams
glass
it
looked
dark
amber
and
smelled
like
sweet
apples
taste
was
like
a
thickish
apple
juice
a
little
too
sweet
and
thick
for
me
i
guess
that
masks
the
alcohol
one
can
was
enough
i
wont
be
buying
any
more
as
i
like
a
lighter
less
sweet
apple
cider
or
ale
this
would
go
with
spicy
szechuan
or
mexican
food
god
this
brings
back
great
memories
of
my
youth
this
has
a
small
of
straight
booze
its
nothing
special
but
it
can
quickly
get
you
hammered
insert
90s
gangster
rap
lyrics
here
not
crafty
tasty
or
special
but
4
of
oe
can
get
me
tipsy
a
great
beer
to
drink
whenever
you
feel
like
having
a
good
time
probably
my
favorite
beer
olde
english
is
sort
of
the
classic
malt
liquor
it
has
numerous
movie
rap
music
and
other
cultural
references
and
it
isnt
hard
to
see
why
if
you
drink
the
stuff
it
certainly
is
memorable
i
dont
know
if
there
is
methyl
alcohol
in
here
but
the
buzz
is
kind
of
intense
and
the
people
who
say
that
they
drink
four
or
five
of
these
a
night
are
probably
lying
and
either
way
are
people
to
steer
clear
of
its
alcohol
in
a
pinch
just
like
ai
said
with
the
better
steel
reserve
treat
with
caution
dont
let
this
one
get
even
close
to
room
temp
edward
40
hands
it
started
out
drinking
this
prior
to
being
of
age
drank
a
decent
amount
of
it
actually
i
once
dropped
a
full
forty
on
my
garage
floor
and
the
smell
was
lethal
havent
touched
the
stuff
since
by
far
my
favorite
malt
liquor
no
reason
to
drink
this
beer
now
nor
then
o
the
good
ol
days
of
drinking
these
on
the
train
still
awful
this
was
never
a
first
choice
when
we
were
scoring
beer
from
an
adult
the
one
time
we
did
get
this
was
due
to
the
wino
who
pimped
for
us
it
was
nasty
but
it
got
the
job
done
nasty
bottom
of
the
barrel
higher
alcohol
content
beer
very
harsh
after
taste
and
very
malty
taste
had
this
in
my
very
early
under
aged
drinking
days
and
havent
had
it
since
this
is
truly
not
worth
any
amount
of
another
classic
american
malt
liquor
corn
and
malt
sweetness
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
nothing
fancy
just
an
easy
drinker
pours
piss
yellow
and
quite
sweet
one
bottle
of
this
stuff
is
enough
to
mess
you
up
the
original
ghetto
juice
the
only
beer
that
ive
ever
poured
down
the
sink
after
two
tastes
repulsive
gets
you
fucked
up
and
doesnt
taste
too
bad
some
people
like
it
but
i
think
it
is
god
awful
who
knows
what
is
all
in
it
and
it
tastes
like
playdoh
count
me
out
theres
a
lot
of
other
better
cheap
crap
out
there
gross
beer
edward
40
hands
that
is
all
if
there
were
negative
ratings
i
would
choose
them
its
mouthfriendly
and
the
wide
bottle
is
easy
to
hang
onto
when
everything
else
is
slipping
im
looking
at
this
beer
as
a
malt
liquor
and
a
american
style
lager
only
if
im
looking
at
in
that
category
its
a
good
beer
like
i
said
in
the
mouthfeel
private
stock
and
this
are
the
best
malt
liquors
ive
ever
had
private
stock
was
my
all
time
favorite
malt
liquor
but
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
as
a
malt
liquor
and
at
the
price
this
beer
is
at
its
a
winner
dont
knock
olde
english
800
till
youve
tried
it
for
yourself
we
used
to
pay
crackheads
in
trenton
2
dollars
to
buy
us
these
it
was
worth
it
i
have
a
great
marriage
i
love
my
wife
but
if
i
didnt
i
would
drink
this
to
be
able
to
die
sooner
overall
im
hardly
a
malt
liquor
connoisseur
but
for
sub2
24oz
cans
of
anything
beerlike
you
might
have
a
hard
time
beating
olde
e
the
aire
of
mystery
that
surrounds
the
40
is
palpable
or
maybe
its
just
the
weird
after
taste
the
sarcastic
quotation
marks
that
surround
the
800
taunt
the
drinker
a
true
connoisseur
will
know
that
this
is
indeed
what
olde
england
would
have
enjoyed
olde
english
800
pairs
well
with
traditional
bangers
n
mash
or
even
a
mouthful
of
dirt
with
a
side
of
monty
python
if
real
english
fare
is
unavailable
this
malt
liquor
is
as
dry
as
british
humor
and
as
inviting
as
an
oxford
boarding
school
i
will
definitely
be
enjoying
the
40
maybe
eventually
sometime
in
the
future
enjoy
tikk
american
style
malt
liquor
not
bad
for
a
malt
liquor
i
bought
a
4
pack
of
tall
boys
for
3
35
and
after
the
first
couple
of
drinks
it
goes
down
ok
malt
liquor
is
not
for
everybody
but
i
like
it
yes
it
has
a
strong
metallic
bitter
taste
but
in
some
old
school
way
that
is
why
i
like
it
call
me
crazy
i
like
my
oe
800
ice
cold
and
have
even
used
it
to
mix
with
stout
im
seeing
so
much
hate
about
this
brew
this
stuff
is
delicious
and
cheap
perfect
for
a
man
on
a
budget
i
prefer
this
to
budweiser
or
any
other
american
beer
anyday
the
bottle
and
label
also
looks
bad
ass
which
is
major
points
for
i
could
go
for
3
40s
right
now
ive
seen
this
beer
in
more
homeless
peoples
hand
than
any
other
on
the
ground
at
parks
too
so
when
i
first
tried
it
i
felt
i
was
joining
some
unspoken
covenant
of
dirt
poor
alcoholics
and
it
wasnt
half
bad
a
little
stronger
than
colt
45
but
7
5
alc
makes
sure
you
feel
it
and
feel
it
quick
a
little
heavy
on
the
stomach
but
tolerable
classic
malt
smell
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
kind
of
leaves
you
with
a
thizz
face
if
you
chug
it
but
its
cheap
and
gets
the
job
done
o
first
time
i
had
this
i
was
16
swilled
it
from
the
bottle
like
a
baby
eyes
all
waterin
a
friend
and
i
went
with
this
chick
he
was
trying
to
make
out
with
over
to
her
exboyfriends
house
to
get
weed
stayed
till
round
5am
got
all
dizzied
up
i
left
just
as
my
friend
and
the
chick
started
goin
at
it
apparently
the
ex
woke
up
and
found
them
together
on
the
couch
fussin
and
a
cussin
ensued
seemed
like
it
took
me
hours
to
finish
guzzling
that
shit
i
can
vaguely
recall
closing
my
eyes
and
powering
the
last
few
ounces
down
face
glowing
red
remember
it
being
more
cloying
i
guess
im
a
fancy
beer
nerd
now
and
i
must
say
this
truly
aint
half
bad
for
what
it
is
gotta
admit
i
was
quaffin
away
at
it
overall
a
1
75
olde
english
800
brewed
by
miller
brewing
co
this
brew
is
a
malt
liquor
and
it
pours
out
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
nice
light
white
head
olde
english
800
has
an
abv
of
5
9
this
brew
has
the
look
and
smell
of
most
malt
liquors
the
smell
is
sweet
with
grains
and
malts
nothing
special
but
nothing
bad
this
brew
has
a
lot
carbonation
the
taste
is
smooth
and
crisp
for
being
a
malt
liquor
you
get
a
hint
of
sweetness
but
it
is
not
over
powering
this
brew
goes
down
nice
mouth
feel
is
nice
too
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
5
out
of
5
i
will
pick
this
brew
up
again
i
would
say
its
better
to
go
with
some
other
40
except
maybe
hurricane
i
know
people
enjoy
their
craft
selection
but
com
on
we
drink
this
stuff
to
feel
good
argue
all
you
want
about
why
you
drink
beer
but
honestly
we
all
drink
it
for
the
same
reason
to
varying
degrees
for
the
price
the
quality
of
this
beer
is
fairly
decent
o
this
is
the
classic
malt
liquor
nothing
complex
just
gets
the
job
done
no
wonder
when
most
of
my
guys
back
in
the
days
were
drinking
this
or
st
ides
i
stuck
to
my
bottles
of
riunite
lambrusco
o
poured
the
rest
of
this
one
out
for
my
homies
at
less
than
2
its
not
like
i
was
losing
anything
worth
having
unless
youre
looking
for
the
cheapest
nastiest
way
to
get
buzzed
possible
stay
away
from
this
one
i
admit
this
was
bought
as
more
of
a
gag
and
i
had
no
intentions
of
finishing
it
needless
to
say
my
low
expectations
were
met
thoroughly
id
say
this
is
by
far
the
easiest
malt
liquor
ive
drank
smooth
good
taste
and
cheap
not
at
all
like
211
and
for
some
reason
i
was
never
keen
on
trying
this
particular
malt
until
my
friends
got
me
to
try
it
glad
i
did
definitely
plan
on
getting
it
more
often
this
beer
is
definitely
not
an
awful
it
is
very
drinkable
not
too
bad
after
seeing
the
gutter
ball
ratings
this
beer
had
i
went
down
to
the
7eleven
tonite
and
bought
a
bottle
of
olde
english
for
3
and
a
half
bucks
cracked
that
shit
and
drank
a
good
not
great
but
an
all
around
decent
beer
you
cant
drink
this
beer
and
expect
the
ferrari
experience
know
that
you
are
not
driving
a
ferrari
but
a
station
wagon
expect
that
and
you
will
probably
enjoy
this
beer
nice
yellow
color
with
a
pleasing
flavor
and
taste
nothing
distracting
here
i
look
forward
to
and
enjoy
this
beer
every
friday
night
and
really
what
else
matters
good
by
itself
great
mixed
with
equal
halves
orange
juice
the
hops
are
calling
my
name
every
time
one
of
my
train
hoppin
buddies
brings
one
of
these
bad
boys
along
i
cave
and
trade
my
last
lucky
strike
for
it
it
puts
hair
on
the
chest
makes
ya
tough
i
want
my
dollar
back
for
an
interesting
twist
try
it
warmed
sometime
and
i
do
not
mean
room
temp
an
acquaintance
offered
a
sample
of
his
preferred
style
of
consumption
which
was
to
leave
the
bottle
sitting
out
in
the
warm
summer
sun
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
have
to
say
that
it
does
mellow
the
flavor
making
it
strangely
palatable
i
give
this
a
5
across
the
board
because
it
is
what
it
is
malt
liquor
and
it
meets
all
the
expectations
of
just
that
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
inexpensive
if
anyone
is
coming
onto
this
website
to
and
rating
a
2
or
3
then
there
is
something
wrong
with
them
and
that
person
should
ask
them
self
was
i
dissapointed
because
the
malt
liquour
was
not
a
5
and
did
not
meet
my
expectations
or
was
i
dissapointed
because
i
drank
malt
liqour
to
be
honest
it
is
just
as
good
as
any
ipa
that
i
have
consumed
because
like
all
beer
it
is
an
aquired
taste
and
to
much
of
anything
could
make
you
sick
simply
put
take
a
high
end
beer
that
is
highly
hopped
and
take
a
malt
liqour
and
give
it
to
someone
who
has
never
tried
any
beer
before
and
they
would
think
that
both
are
disquisting
this
is
a
bang
for
the
buck
and
works
well
wheter
your
on
a
tight
budget
or
you
have
a
lot
of
money
and
besides
it
is
up
to
you
the
drinker
to
decide
what
your
taste
buds
like
not
some
amateurs
on
a
website
who
have
no
idea
what
they
are
talking
about
overall
an
alright
malt
but
not
the
best
out
there
it
is
a
bit
on
the
crisper
side
for
a
malt
so
if
that
is
what
your
going
for
then
this
is
a
decent
choice
there
is
not
much
going
on
here
i
used
to
be
able
to
get
a
couple
of
these
for
around
5
00
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
have
not
had
one
since
but
they
used
to
be
a
cost
effective
way
to
get
a
nice
buzz
when
taste
comes
a
distance
second
to
price
nice
memories
but
i
doubt
i
would
be
a
fan
now
o
this
is
probably
my
favorite
true
malt
liquour
on
the
market
no
rogues
old
daddys
little
helper
or
dogfish
heads
liquor
de
malt
do
not
count
as
a
true
malt
liquour
sorry
ill
take
this
over
colt
40
st
ides
mickeys
or
cobra
any
day
but
private
stock
still
might
be
my
favorite
i
was
shocked
to
see
this
has
an
abv
of
7
5
i
did
a
bit
of
research
and
apparently
the
west
coast
gets
a
stronger
version
than
we
do
back
east
weird
if
i
were
to
sum
myself
up
in
one
word
its
swank
im
a
guy
who
only
cares
for
the
fine
things
in
life
if
youre
like
me
then
olde
english
is
the
beer
for
you
the
aroma
of
oak
is
evident
once
you
open
it
probably
what
is
was
aged
in
the
taste
is
smooth
and
sweet
similar
to
many
other
highend
european
beers
i
became
violently
ill
shortly
after
finishing
this
probably
unrelated
i
drank
the
beer
cold
in
a
mug
and
it
was
suprising
very
crisp
the
carbonation
gives
it
a
very
smooth
body
high
marks
for
good
carbonation
crisp
mouthfeel
and
not
much
lingering
taste
i
i
drank
my
24
oz
in
half
an
hour
this
beer
gets
the
job
done
when
you
stare
into
the
abyss
sometimes
the
abyss
stares
back
into
you
or
something
everything
about
it
is
okay
from
the
color
to
the
taste
its
neither
good
nor
bad
this
malt
liquor
is
piss
only
drank
it
because
it
was
free
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
flat
it
tastes
like
a
40
oz
looks
like
a
40
oz
would
rather
drink
a
nice
trippel
or
something
it
is
just
not
my
style
of
preference
damn
you
miller
for
making
suck
beverages
miller
brewing
olde

o
not
the
worst
in
the
style
but
far
from
my
favorite
one
of
the
primary
places
where
it
fails
is
its
lack
of
the
sugary
sweetness
that
helps
mask
the
utilitarian
nature
of
the
style
o
so
this
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
ive
had
some
beers
i
couldnt
finish
but
this
one
wasnt
horrible
tasting
and
i
could
drink
it
it
just
didnt
have
much
taste
to
speak
of
its
not
terrible

was
hesitant
to
try
this

because
of
the
simple
fact
that
it
was
a
malt
liquor
i
had
heard
from
people
that
malt
liquor
is
disgusting
and
should
never
be
consumed
by
anybody
anywhere
but
i
decided
that
letting
other
people
tell
me
what
to
drink
was
foolish

bottom
one
that
makes
you
think
has
my
life
really
come
to
this
best
served
wrapped
in
a
brown
paper
bag
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
that
is
close
to
water
not
much
head
not
much
lacing
and
below
average
carbonation
the
dominate
smell
is
mild
malt
with
some
hops
coming
through
first
taste
is
light
sweet
and
lacking
in
flavor
not
much
body
at
all
not
much
taste
not
worth
your
time
i
was
recently
in
the
liqour
store
with
5
and
wanted
to
relive
my
college
days
so
i
decided
to
pick
up
some
olde
e
what
can
i
say
that
hasnt
already
been
said
about
his
terrible
beer
it
tastes
like
metal
corn
and
stink
when
i
drink
it
i
want
to
get
it
down
as
soon
as
possible
no
foam
at
all
with
this
beer
same
piss
color
that
is
know
in
this
beer
man
stay
clear
of
this
one
only
for
the
faint
of
heart
but
it
does
catch
up
with
you
i
call
this
one
the
creeper
one
taste
is
enough
for
this
beast
it
has
an
aroma
of
old
malt
and
bad
alcohol
there
are
some
sour
yeast
smells
as
well
it
has
a
dirty
river
color
and
not
much
head
it
appears
to
be
tan
though
body
is
think
and
syrupy
which
leads
to
poor
drinkability
i
will
probably
never
again
venture
back
to
this
stuff
seen
a
lot
of
cheap
beer
in
my
short
time
but
id
never
seen
this
one
before
sounded
cheap
was
cheap
so
i
bought
it
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
perfectly
clear
straw
color
with
a
thin
sparkling
white
head
the
smell
is
very
underwhelming
corn
a
slight
fruitiness
and
a
bit
of
grain
are
about
all
that
are
discernable
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
pale
euro
lager
slight
cornygrain
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
a
dry
onedimensional
boring
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
ultra
light
if
i
had
to
guess
its
probably
in
the
range
of
1
00001
maybe
with
a
stale
carbonation
drinkability
is
decent
due
to
the
fact
that
its
cheap
as
hell
and
has
7
5
which
isnt
really
that
noticeable
definitely
not
my
choice
in
beer
but
i
can
see
its
purpose
ah
olde
english
any
strong
beer
tastes
good
when
youre
down
and
out
and
looking
for
a
cheap
way
to
numb
your
brain
7
5
is
a
nice
little
bonus
and
youll
be
feeling
good
in
no
time
although
i
swear
to
god
getting
drunk
on
good
beer
actually
feels
better
getting
drunk
for
2
37
is
not
that
bad
of
a
feeling
as
well
it
goes
down
very
smoothly
for
a
concoction
as
strong
as
it
is
you
would
think
it
would
taste
like
nothing
but
alcohol
considering
this
olde
english
can
be
considered
at
least
well
balanced
if
not
good
tasting
but
most
of
all
i
love
that
feeling
of
being
boosedup
it
gives
you
you
drink
it
and
you
start
to
feel
pretty
drunk
fast
yeah
i
like
that
i
dont
care
how
cheap
this
is
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
it
was
given
to
me
i
would
rather
piss
on
a
turd
blend
it
microwave
it
and
eat
it
avoid
this
beer
at
all
costs
the
name
is
deceiving
there
is
nothing
olde
about
this
beer
and
there
is
nothing
english
about
it
the
price
tag
may
seem
attractive
but
so
is
a
cheap
hooker
who
ends
up
giving
you
herpes
oe800
is
no
different
yes
i
probably
got
herpes
from
drinking
this
shit
i
got
arrested
while
drinking
this
when
i
was
15
to
this
day
im
not
sure
if
it
was
because
of
my
age
or
my
choice
in
drinks
this
is
definitely
just
for
those
who
want
to
get
drunk
and
dont
want
something
to
savor
or
enjoy
avoid
like
the
plague
metallic
and
chemical
mf
is
of
some
corn
slightly
sugary
with
a
really
bad
aftertaste
without
a
doubt
it
is
difficult
to
consume
all
40oz
let
alone
3
of
them
in
a
night
which
i
have
done
several
times
in
the
past
ahhhh
the
good
old
days
this
malt
liquor
is
just
okay
however
it
does
get
the
job
done
the
appearance
is
average
for
a
malt
liquor
head
retention
is
decent
as
seen
within
my
40
smells
like
corn
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
somewhat
thin
but
the
mouthfeel
is
refreshingly
fizzy
i
would
rate
this
at
a
decent
drinkability
this
99cent22oz
bottle
pours
a
typical
see
thru
golden
colorwith
pure
white
head
that
actually
leaves
some
lacing
as
it
quickly
dissipates
it
smells
of
bread
doughand
a
little
musty
alcohol
the
taste
is
surprisingly
not
disgusting
considering
the
ridiculous
priceyou
cant
buy
generic
soda
this
cheapand
in
my
opinion
i
would
drink
this
over
a
soda
any
daythe
mouthfeel
is
what
you
would
expectlight
bodiedaverage
carbonationno
real
aftertaste
i
could
easily
drink
this
over
any
bud
or
miller
productit
actually
has
more
flavor
than
either
of
thembut
probably
more
carbs
drinkability
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
choke
back
8
oz
lets
go
get
some
real
beer
at
shakespears
sarasota
d
this
is
my
2nd
favorite
malt
liquor
it
gets
you
pretty
trashed
and
is
better
than
a
lot
of
them
out
there
forget
it
i
dont
care
how
many
times
this
beer
is
mentioned
in
rap
songs
wouldnt
drink
this
brew
again
if
it
was
the
only
alcoholic
drink
offered
at
a
party
actually
ended
up
getting
pretty
nauseous
after
downing
a
40
of
this
back
in
college
a
lot
of
alcohol
for
your
buck
at
7
50
for
a
1
99
appearance
is
below
mediocore
and
the
smell
is
awful
not
trying
to
sound
like
a
beer
snob
but
those
with
class
would
avoid
a
hefty
malt
liquor
like
this
unless
for
some
reason
you
are
a
fan
of
this
particular
style
mouthfeel
was
less
than
awful
and
the
only
upside
of
this
brew
is
that
once
you
made
it
past
half
the
bottle
the
other
half
goes
down
a
bit
easier
cheap
drunk
for
a
college
student
pennies
for
the
abv
bit
of
a
stale
bread
taste
some
malt
heavy
alcohol
aftertaste
not
good
at
all
but
gets
the
job
done
really
nothing
pleasant
or
particularly
unpleasant
about
it
look
if
youre
drinking
this
then
you
are
planning
on
getting
lit
on
the
cheap
or
just
broke
hopefully
if
it
is
the
former
then
you
are
in
college
like
i
used
to
get
down
of
course
ive
been
on
the
latter
side
also
and
it
sucks
much
like
old
e
the
light
goldyellow
color
is
see
thru
when
held
up
to
the
light
and
the
smell
is
just
like
rubbing
alcohol
while
the
taste
is
horrendous
it
at
least
does
not
contain
a
bitter
aftertaste
oh
and
after
slamming
a
few
of
these
40
ozs
expect
a
colossal
headache
the
next
morning
just
finishing
college
and
having
a
lot
of
experince
of
horrible
beer
and
esp
malt
beer
this
is
prob
my
favorite
still
it
ranks
low
compared
of
the
full
flavors
that
are
out
there
if
one
has
to
drink
a
malt
beer
then
def
stay
away
from
this
its
awefull
d
this
is
one
of
the
least
offensive
malt
liquors
on
the
market
its
the
most
like
real
lager
but
i
like
my
40s
like
i
like
my
gansta
rap
i
want
to
be
offended
good
malt
liquor
for
the
buck
yellow
in
color
with
a
head
that
lingers
aroma
is
strong
and
sweet
somewhat
corny
taste
is
a
bit
hard
to
deal
with
at
first
not
much
to
the
imagination
as
far
as
taste
goes
anyway
somewhat
unsettling
and
bland
on
the
tongue
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
overall
not
very
drinkable
ill
take
another
bottle
of
private
stock
over
this
overall
it
was
surprisingly
drinkable
for
a
malt
liquor
i
hear
it
brings
back
the
shine
on
olde
furniture
too
i
like
it
i
know
a
lot
of
people
dont
like
this
brew
but
i
mean
come
on
for
three
dollars
a
six
pack
you
cant
be
that
and
get
a
decent
buzz
afterwards
awesome
definitely
coming
back
altogether
uninspired
and
no
way
i
could
finish
a
40
of
this
even
the
24
is
trying
my
patience
i
do
find
it
a
bit
more
interesting
than
steel
reserve
but
still
nowhere
near
rogues
dads
little
helper
if
you
like
corn
then
this
delicious
malt
liquor
is
right
up
your
alley
with
a
nose
of
roasted
corn
cakes
and
a
taste
that
combines
can
creamed
corn
with
slight
touches
of
whisky
like
fusel
alcohol
it
is
the
perfect
beer
for
a
lover
of
raw
corn
but
not
a
tasty
one
oh
yeah
when
youre
16
and
looking
for
a
2
buzz
out
of
a
brown
paper
bag
this
was
the
shit
basically
a
big
version
of
an
american
macro
lager
with
more
malt
adjuncts
used
in
this
case
corn
i
think
no
hop
presence
detected
looks
like
a
macro
in
the
bottle
i
cant
say
i
ever
poured
this
in
a
glass
to
find
out
if
you
wanna
get
a
buzz
really
cheap
this
is
a
good
place
to
start
what
can
be
said
that
hasnt
been
said
about
the
40oz
king
of
malts
most
users
will
describe
the
taste
and
feel
in
detail
but
with
this
brew
it
all
comes
down
to
getting
drunk
very
drunk
i
drank
three
40s
of
this
a
few
years
back
at
my
house
party
lets
just
say
i
was
more
gone
than
the
nyc
blackout
of
77
this
is
still
a
great
brew
for
gettin
drunk
taste
isnt
half
bad
especially
for
a
malt
heck
the
label
hasnt
even
changed
since
the
70s
you
see
oe
and
you
know
what
your
in
for
keep
swillin
overall
there
are
better
cheap
malt
liquors
out
there
avoid
this
one
by
way
of
comparison
i
found
schiltz
malt
liquor
bull
a
lot
more
drinkable
than
oe
800
what
can
you
sayabout
good
old
ole
e
me
adn
a
few
buddies
decided
to
down
one
for
old
times
sake
didnt
pour
it
as
how
could
you
this
one
has
to
be
drank
out
of
the
brown
bag
for
sure
looks
and
smelled
pretty
much
like
urine
not
cool
and
i
dont
know
how
i
drank
soo
much
of
this
when
i
was
younger
ok
so
maybe
the
smell
had
the
slightest
moldy
grain
hint
to
it
the
taste
was
ughh
wow
i
really
dont
know
how
i
used
to
pund
this
i
guess
it
was
just
the
times
overall
i
will
never
being
going
back
to
this
one
again
it
was
fun
a
long
time
ago
but
now
just
painful
lol
it
was
fun
though
and
a
good
throwback

not

not

its
all
yours
a
very

meet
we
had
here
recognizing
the

styles
untested
to

off

for

check
my
previous
reviews
to
see
what
you
missed
of
this
contest
good
night
everyone
the
beer
is
what
it
is
this
beer
is
a
7
5
alcohol
delivery
system
at
ninety
nine
cents
a
double
duece
this
is
acceptable
man
this
was
a
bad
idea
and
it
will
be
awhile
before
i
buy
another
beer
from
the
good
old
days
myspace
compassaicrock
imo
this
is
not
worth
pouring
into
a
pint
glass
but
for
appearance
i
had
to
poured
from
a
24oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
light
straw
color
forming
a
1
inch
fluffy
head
that
actually
left
thick
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
bad
but
not
skunky
mostly
smells
like
corn
and
grain
the
taste
isnt
as
bad
as
most
think
but
its
not
quality
by
any
means
corn
and
grain
flavor
maybe
a
little
malt
too
thin
mouthfeel
making
this
easy
to
chug
like
many
do
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
my
favorite
that
said
i
only
drink
one
maybe
once
or
twice
a
year
worth
a
try
a
stereotypical
example
of
this
style
not
a
good
one
i
could
think
of
one
named
after
a
famous
firearm
that
is
a
much
better
example
of
this
style
of
brew
d
yikes
i
literally
almost
vomited
on
my
last
gulp
of
this
horrendous
beer
avoid
at
all
costs
believe
me
you
arent
missing
anything
this
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
color
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
large
2
finger
head
that
faded
quickly
carbonation
was
very
high
at
first
and
then
became
flat
after
a
few
minutes
aroma
was
corny
and
fruity
with
a
hint
of
that
rotting
vege
smell
not
good
taste
was
just
as
bad
very
watery
and
boring
with
hints
of
the
infamous
rotting
vegetables
corn
grits
and
just
a
slight
taste
of
malt
no
hop
or
bittering
flavor
present
i
didnt
even
pick
up
an
alcoholic
note
which
you
expect
from
this
style
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
bland
drinkability
was
low
due
to
the
relative
lack
of
flavor
or
body
the
40
became
a
drain
pour
after
only
about
10
ounces
were
gone
i
dont
understand
what
all
the
hoopla
is
with
this
beer
no
wonder
all
the
gangbangers
are
killing
themselves
something
that
tastes
this
bad
would
make
a
killer
out
of
gandhi
not
recommended
at
all
d
drinkability
is
middle
of
the
road
for
the
high
abv
these
go
down
easy
enough
after
you
aquire
the
flavor
the
final
drunk
from
drinking
40s
back
in
the
day
was
just
right
adequate
but
not
excessive
recomendeed
for
anyone
on
a
budget
or
just
getting
into
the
beer
world
otherwise
just
keep
away
mouth
has
a
watery
entrance
that
hits
sour
along
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
some
sweet
peach
notes
appear
along
the
tongue
after
swallowing
pours
the
typical
malt
liquor
way
slightly
dark
golden
with
a
thing
ring
of
bubbles
typical
cornygrainy
smell
and
a
hint
of
burnt
veggies
sweet
tasting
and
not
overly
grainy
lot
of
corn
in
the
flavor
but
this
one
is
really
smooth
mouthfeel
is
surpisingly
not
sticky
considering
the
abv
yet
it
still
holds
firm
in
the
mouth
like
a
higher
gravity
malt
liquor
highly
drinkable
and
a
nice
change
from
steel
reserve
i
think
ive
found
my
new
favorite
malt
liquor
olde
english
800
drank
straight
from
a
clear
thirty
two
ounce
bottle
color
is
orange
the
smell
is
fairly
nasty
tastes
like
adjunct
run
amuck
this
is
fairly
bad
not
the
worst
malt
liquor
ive
had
but
not
good
either
for
malt
liquor
connisouers
and
rappers
only
avoid
unless
you
can
only
scrape
up
enough
money
for
this
yeah
baby
the
first
malt
liquor
i
ever
tasted
light
yellow
nonoffensive
well
hidden
alcohol
aroma
with
hints
of
corn
and
pear
yes
its
full
of
corn
and
its
fairly
grainy
but
there
isnt
really
anything
in
this
that
makes
it
intolerable
no
off
flavors
whatsoever
ill
be
honest
i
finished
all
forty
ounces
and
im
proud
of
it
this
was
much
better
than
the
keystone
light
that
i
had
later
in
the
evening
drinkability
thank
god
i
only
paid
a
buck
fifty
for
this
im
not
sure
ill
be
able
to
finish
it
still
high
alcohol
content
and
low
price
makes
it
an
excellent
party
beer
this
doesnt
even
pretend
to
be
a
good
beer
it
is
what
it
is
and
i
dont
like
it
its
ironic
that
the
only
beer
style
with
the
word
malt
in
the
name
has
the
smallest
percentage
of
malt
in
it
olde
english
is
royalty
amongst
malt
liquor
40s
its
lightamber
coloration
hitest
cornblessed
constitution
and
overall
appeal
are
second
to
none
in
the
malt
liquor
game
enough
slummin
w
da
homiez
bullshit
either
drink
this
or
dont
no
need
to
mock
the
poor
in
your
poor
attempt
to
cop
a
buzz
olde
english
it
might
not
boast
the
imported
taste
of
private
stock
but
it
does
have
33
crowns
on
the
label
i
counted
pours
yellow
with
perfect
clarity
fizzy
white
two
and
a
half
finger
head
that
shows
poor
retention
and
no
lacing
whatsoever
the
aroma
is
of
ceral
grain
and
apple
ester
but
nothing
fowl
a
faint
grain
taste
is
knocked
aside
by
a
huge
hard
cider
flavor
and
alcoholic
bite
slightly
dry
aftertaste
with
fusels
and
cider
reteating
comfortably
the
flavor
is
too
estery
sweet
even
for
the
style
and
is
grossly
unbalanced
however
the
flavor
fades
quickly
and
a
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
creates
a
drinkability
that
is
the
strong
pont
of
this
beer
the
finish
is
mostly
clean
and
allows
the
consumer
to
get
drunk
fast
for
cheap
which
is
really
the
aim
of
this
beer
not
impressed
but
didnt
expect
to
be
it
is
what
it
is
maybe
ill
consider
this
if
i
become
homeless
but
until
then
ill
leave
it
on
the
store
shelf
where
it
belongs
as
a
teen
i
drank
this
a
few
times
when
i
had
little
money
to
spend
and
wanted
something
to
blitz
on
i
can
not
do
an
unbiased
review
here
or
attempt
to
review
it
as
i
would
do
my
other
beers
and
with
that
being
said
here
goes
this
is
by
far
the
worst
swill
you
could
ever
think
to
try
and
consume
it
smells
as
bad
as
it
tastes
avoid
at
all
costs
unless
you
are
the
verry
adventurous
homie
dont
play
that
my
buddy
was
in
a
rush
to
get
something
simple
from
the
local
packy
before
it
closed
so
i
toldem
to
pick
up
a
few
good
ol
oes
decided
to
keep
it
real
and
drink
this
one
straight
from
the
40
bottle
with
it
still
in
the
bag
appearance
what
can
i
say
looks
a
lot
like
pee
pee
smell
was
of
corn
and
other
weak
tasting
grains
that
didnt
do
much
at
all
for
the
beer
taste
had
malt
running
amuck
throughout
and
the
alcohol
was
very
up
front
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
due
to
excessive
malt
and
alcohol
presence
drinkability
wasnt
bad
until
i
got
to
the
end
in
which
case
i
dumped
the
bottoms
which
were
just
too
harsh
to
quaf
final
verdict
this
isnt
a
good
beer
if
yor
are
looking
for
quality
it
may
be
okay
in
the
world
of
cheap
malt
liquors
serving
only
one
purpose
to
get
you
drunk
quick
but
it
isnt
anything
to
seek
out
on
the
bright
side
theyre
really
cheap
and
if
you
want
to
get
wasted
without
burning
a
whole
in
your
wallet
just
grab
a
couple
of
these
i
advise
playing
edward
40
hands
with
this
beer
cheers
this
stands
out
from
most
malt
liqours
since
it
has
a
bit
higher
alcohal
percentage
giving
it
a
better
deal
but
i
would
recommend
chugging
it
down
so
you
wont
have
to
bare
the
taste
ah
olde
english
what
can
i
say
about
you
youre
the
40
to
drink
if
you
have
to
drink
a
40
i
suppose
you
look
terrible
and
you
stink
real
bad
but
after
the
first
little
taste
all
hoppy
and
smooth
i
just
cant
stop
until
ive
finished
top
of
the
line
on
malt
liquors
in
my
opinion
and
in
some
cases
id
rather
drink
this
than
light
american
lagers
coors
miller
genny
this
is
a
personal
favorite
of
mine
sometimes
you
just
want
a
crappy
beer
and
this
is
it
on
my
way
home
from
work
i
stopped
for
a
beer
at
a
weird
redneck
bar
with
a
coworker
there
in
the
cooler
behind
the
bar
was
a
40
of
oe
so
with
my
choices
limited
to
crap
i
went
a
few
steps
further
and
got
me
a
40
of
oe
playing
pool
drink
a
forty
that
cost
me
5
was
a
weird
way
to
get
off
work
well
it
is
a
little
darker
than
most
adjunct
beers
but
the
smells
is
of
corn
and
some
kind
of
monkey
urine
it
tastes
like
cron
urine
and
ash
smooth
like
a
handful
of
broken
glass
i
would
drink
this
again
most
likely
the
best
40
i
have
had
drinkability
on
the
other
hand
is
the
best
part
if
you
can
ignore
the
smell
and
taste
then
you
sure
have
found
your
beer
probably
around
2
for
a
fat
40
oz
so
if
your
cheap
then
youll
dig
this
brew
for
sure
the
fusel
alcohols
in
this
beer
not
only
get
you
drunk
faster
but
more
drunk
with
more
nausea
i
was
so
ill
after
drinking
this
never
again
im
bringing
my
own
beer
next
time
served
the
classic
wayout
of
a
40oz
bottle
definitely
resembles
urine
in
both
smell
and
appearance
with
a
pungently
bland
smell
dominating
the
nose
taste
isnt
terrible
its
the
kind
of
thing
youd
get
really
used
to
after
many
sips
and
the
alcohol
is
such
that
if
you
want
to
let
loose
for
a
night
this
is
the
way
to
go
very
little
lingering
taste
or
mouthfeel
so
it
goes
down
easy
and
facilitates
many
more
everyone
needs
a
night
with
a
beer
like
this
and
at
2
50
the
price
cant
be
beat
i
realize
there
are
much
better
beers
out
there
but
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
this
is
pretty
good
enjoy
this
is
the
normal
run
of
the
mill
40
ounce
malt
liquor
its
got
a
pretty
bad
unrefined
taste
a
bit
of
that
dirty
sweetness
and
its
rather
harsh
having
said
that
its
a
40
and
the
main
purpose
of
40s
is
to
get
you
slammed
when
your
too
poor
to
get
anything
else
its
swill
but
its
still
a
classic
among
40z
drinkability
probably
the
best
of
the
malt
liquors
faint
praise
but
praise
indeed
this
stuff
isnt
as
poor
as
most
in
the
category
and
is
actually
quite
unobtrusive
that
is
until
it
kicks
you
in
the
ass
drinkability
is
good
for
the
style
i
had
no
trouble
sinking
the
8
ball
exercise
caution
after
drinking
2
jugs
things
can
get
foggy
i
have
this
wierd
addiction
to
having
some
schwill
now
and
again
just
to
keep
things
grounded
on
my
way
back
from
the
hollywood
bowl
i
needed
some
malt
liquor
so
this
was
the
pick
40ozer
served
in
a
brown
paper
bag
smelled
like
corn
soaked
in
sugar
and
roasted
on
an
open
flame
tasted
very
similair
except
take
out
the
open
flame
sugar
and
corn
drink
this
fast
as
it
is
sewer
material
as
it
gets
warm
you
can
tell
this
is
a
highly
sugar
based
beer
not
reccomended
except
when
hidden
in
a
brown
paper
bag
olde
english
800
brings
to
mind
the
beautiful
pastoral
english
countryside
of
old
while
the
eagle
makes
one
think
of
rugged
individualistic
redwhiteandblue
america
only
kidding
these
are
two
simple
bottles
of
beer
that
were
brewed
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only
inebriation
oe
800
is
the
superior
product
but
i
caution
the
reader
that
superior
is
a
strictly
relative
term
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
head
rises
rapidly
with
the
consistency
of
creamy
dish
washing
soap
suds
eggwhite
white
the
body
is
pale
gold
and
surely
you
can
conjure
up
the
apt
metaphor
here
without
me
having
to
do
it
for
you
smell
corn
flakes
wet
newspaper
old
and
brown
apple
cores
taste
puckering
sweetness
upfront
backed
up
nicely
by
the
viscous
mouthfeel
this
is
not
a
beer
to
drink
at
a
temperature
that
is
anything
less
than
cold
pursued
by
a
peppery
hop
bitterness
very
slight
and
in
the
background
simple
sugary
malt
sweetness
dominates
the
taste
aftertaste
some
alcohol
heat
felt
in
the
throat
and
gut
and
just
that
sweetness
fading
out
like
so
much
sugary
apple
juice

few
steps
away

the
texture
of

pours
a
medium
straw

with

fizzy
almost
white
head
nose
is
nutrasweet
over
cornflakes
with
a
slight
metallic
twang
and
no
detectable
hop
bitterness
taste
starts
with
faintly
sweet
cereal
malt
with
a
burgeoning
powdery
smarties
candy
edge
light
cardboard
throughout
and
minimal
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
slightly
sweet
in
the
finish
not
poisonous
but
i
remember
why
i
stopped
drinking
this
stuff
pours
a
piss
yellow
color
with
very
large
head
that
fades
but
stays
there
till
the
beer
is
gone
smell
is
like
all
the
other
mass
produced
beers
out
there
taste
is
very
bland
but
the
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
the
best
part
of
the
beer
actually
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
good
too
this
beer
is
soso
but
alot
better
than
i
expected
for
a
beer
in
40
i
have
been
told
that
this
brew
will
give
you
rhythm
and
soul
this
may
or
may
not
be
true
but
as
far
as
foties
go
this
one
is
in
the
mid
range
clear
bottle
piss
yellow
substance
taste
and
smell
cause
you
to
make
some
funny
faces
there
are
sicker
foties
on
the
market
but
perhaps
there
are
better
ones
as
well
if
you
are
really
looking
for
this
type
of
beer
it
isnt
the
worst
if
you
think
you
are
buying
the
next
great
beer
think
again
even
so
i
have
a
love
for
oe
i
first
drank
it
last
summer
and
ive
had
it
often
since
its
quite
funny
to
chug
out
of
such
a
big
bottle
pair
it
with
fried
chicken
no
joke
for
a
really
good
time
not
ot
drink
really
but
the
7
5
has
one
hell
of
a
kick
as
little
as
there
is
to
this
beer
and
as
negative
as
the
review
may
seem
i
still
think
this
is
one
of
the
top
malt
liquors
out
there
i
have
consumed
more
of
this
than
i
care
to
admit
back
in
the
day
goes
down
easy
for
all
the
trashy
liquor
it
contains
you
do
the
math
well
i
have
to
say
theres
a
darn
good
reason
why
this
stuff
is
cheap
i
had
a
40
and
i
had
to
commit
the
ultimate
beer
sin
pouring
out
half
of
it
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
was
ok
but
by
the
second
half
i
had
to
really
struggle
to
drink
it
my
standard
arguments
like
i
paid
money
for
this
really
failed
to
work
it
certainly
smells
rather
gross
too
it
feels
alright
in
your
mouth
at
least
until
it
gets
bitter
its
pretty
sweet
for
malt
liquor
not
a
good
thing
in
my
opinion
i
personally
prefer
schlitz
malt
liquor
i
think
it
would
taste
much
better
if
i
had
just
slammed
the
40
but
alas
i
did
not
overallwhile
this
may
be
the
standard
for
malt
liquors
as
i
have
heard
what
a
bloody
joke
olde
english
is
the
same
as
any
other
malt
liquor
i
e
its
ghastly
thanks
to
pete
for
the
can
but
for
the
rest
of
you
if
this
is
your
thing
go
with
colt
45
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
cheap
malt
liquor
out
there
its
strong
better
tasting
and
easier
to
drink
than
king
cobra
or
st
ides
and
it
certainly
does
the
trick
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
it
its
not
a
beer
that
you
pour
into
a
nice
glass
or
savor
or
anything
like
that
rather
its
a
classic
swiller
that
gets
you
drunk
and
gives
you
giant
beer
balls
i
feel
like
i
could
knock
out
tyson
right
now
bring
it
on
cheers
one
of
the
worst
malt
liquors
ive
ever
drank
it
poured
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
faded
as
soon
as
it
came
the
smell
was
of
a
nasty
sourness
and
grain
the
taste
was
way
too
sweet
and
nasty
this
is
a
cheepy
that
i
will
never
be
picking
up
again
the
high
gravity
version
is
much
better
in
compairison
as
far
as
40s
go
it
doesnt
get
much
better
than
this
this
is
the
standard
by
which
all
others
are
judged
i
can
truely
say
that
this
doesnt
actually
taste
bad
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
solid
malt
backing
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
but
it
doesnt
taste
like
it
is
caused
by
hops
overall
there
is
just
nothing
like
swilling
down
a
40
of
oe
and
listening
to
some
atcq
well
i
only
bought
this
in
order
to
compare
it
to
dogfish
heads
liqueur
de
malt
and
since
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
a
sample
of
that
at
penn
i
figured
id
see
how
it
measures
up
well
dfh
measures
up
pretty
damn
well
i
only
have
the
pint
glass
and
its
already
rather
difficult
to
finish
off
couldnt
imagine
finishing
off
an
entire
40
poured
a
sample
for
the
bro
and
gave
the
rest
to
our
dead
homies
i
can
say
this
has
motivated
me
since
it
will
drive
me
to
never
want
to
be
poor
enough
to
have
to
drink
this
ever
again
ok
i
went
into
this
expecting
utter
garbage
what
i
found
was
a
surprisingly
drinkable
beer
with
an
innofensive
flavor
and
a
decent
punch
lets
be
honest
this
beer
is
meant
to
do
one
thing
get
you
fd
up
mission
accomplished
there
is
no
hop
flavor
but
a
slightly
grainy
malt
flavor
there
are
the
usual
cornriceother
crap
flavors
but
the
fact
is
the
beer
does
its
job
if
you
are
brown
bagging
it
oe
is
the
way
to
go
510
drinkability
it
isnt
offensive
so
i
could
drink
a
good
bit
of
it
but
do
i
want
to
so
as
i
finish
this
cornridden
8ball
i
propose
a
toast
to
the
finest
40
ounce
beverage
on
the
market
its
the
attitude
adjuster
long
live
olde
e
taste
water
graininflected
water
slightly
sweet
but
barely
anything
with
a
cereal
grit
in
the
mouthfeel
if
it
can
claim
any
at
all
there
are
traces
of
malt
in
the
taste
minor
at
best
and
nothing
else
this
is
a
shadow
of
a
beer
a
whisper
a
phantom
but
one
that
has
a
trick
up
its
sleeve
like
all
the
best
of
this
variety
oh
yeah
no
bothersome
flavor
but
extraboozy
thats
why
they
drink
this
and
only
a
few
tastes
in
i
can
feel
the
hurt
and
the
headache
beginning
to
gather
forces
on
my
mind
and
i
wonder
whether
this
exercise
in
masochistic
research
is
worth
it
at
all
the
bottle
was
a
gift
as
a
joke
and
the
punchline
arrived
as
soon
as
i
announced
i
was
drinking
it
and
im
sure
its
not
time
to
send
this
swill
down
the
drain
and
save
my
brain
theres
a
nice
doppelbock
calling
my
name
once
i
wash
the
taste
of
this
garbage
from
my
mouth
drinkability
this
stuff
was
the
lowest
of
the
low
back
when
i
was
in
college
it
isnt
great
but
even
swill
like
this
beats
the
regular
macro
stuff
comments

the
abv
has
when
up
almost
one
and
a
half
points
from
when
this
ale
was
added
to
the
site
its
now
at
7
5
i
guess
the
quicker
you
go
numb
the
easier
this
is
to
drink
man
im
happy
i
dont
have
to
live
in
a
roach
condominium
and
drink
this
any
more
at
least
though
its
better
than
camo
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
40
oz
bullet
bottle
dark
yellow
color
that
has
a
sizable
white
head
evn
in
the
bottle
taste
is
very
sweet
and
full
of
adjunct
flavor
some
presence
of
alcohol
but
not
that
much
with
most
beer
in
this
price
and
abv
range
this
stuff
is
meant
to
give
you
a
cheap
buzz
it
does
that
but
it
doesnt
taste
good
drinking
oe
isnt
the
best
experience
in
the
world
a
very
skunky
smelling
and
tasting
beer
the
only
plus
side
to
this
is
that
you
will
get
drunker
quicker
but
lets
face
it
is
that
all
that
fun
anyway
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
drank
these
constantly
so
recently
i
went
back
for
a
test
taste
oe
comes
in
a
40
oz
bottle
with
a
red
and
gold
label
beer
is
piss
type
yellow
with
no
head
you
do
not
want
this
beer
in
your
mouth
for
long
the
quicker
it
is
in
your
throat
the
better
the
only
time
to
drink
this
is
if
you
only
have
2
bucks
and
you
have
a
party
to
go
to
i
bought
this
the
only
way
this
should
be
bought
in
a
40
ounce
i
went
back
to
kick
it
in
the
crib
and
thats
where
i
think
i
made
my
first
mistake
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
and
half
on
the
floor
for
my
homies
it
poured
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
foamy
head
that
had
little
lasting
power
about
a
minute
or
so
it
had
a
stench
of
gross
to
it
a
little
bit
of
a
grainy
corn
smell
and
a
bit
of
a
skunky
smell
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
was
stronger
the
taste
was
semi
bitter
with
the
grainy
thing
going
on
again
the
skunk
was
still
there
too
though
not
as
strong
even
though
its
clear
that
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
for
my
biatches
this
isnt
truly
atrocious
i
thought
silver
thunder
and
country
club
neared
those
limits
oe800
seems
to
be
a
popular
ghetto
mixer
as
well
for
example
while
the
brass
monkey
is
the
most
popular
variant
oe
and
orange
juice
a
coworker
of
mine
has
mentioned
the
combination
of
oe
and
sloe
gin
anyways
this
is
a
cheap
beer
that
only
exists
only
for
those
who
want
to
get
plastered
what
you
do
with
it
after
you
buy
it
is
your
choice
but
i
wont
be
choosing
to
make
this
a
regular
habit
anytime
soon
even
if
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
pours
a
transparent
yellow
applejuicy
color
with
a
vigorous
white
head
that
fades
quickly
yes
i
am
actually
pouring
this
into
a
glass
little
to
no
carbonation
smell
is
whew
big
alcohol
sting
and
little
else
except
vague
sensation
of
acidic
chemicals
and
maybe
notes
of
adjuncty
sweetness
thats
saccharine
and
foul
like
those
awful
artificial
sugar
substitutes
nutrasweet
sweetnlow
less
alcohol
noticeable
in
the
taste
taking
a
back
seat
to
more
artificial
sweetness
slightly
tart
in
the
back
palate
but
finishing
with
a
twang
of
plastic
so
help
me
god
plastic
mouthfeel
isnt
that
bad
for
a
40
since
this
is
easy
to
drink
fast
when
cold
i
originally
gave
drinkability
a
2
5
half
an
hour
later
when
my
gut
felt
like
it
had
turned
into
a
ball
of
rock
i
changed
my
mind
this
brew
has
its
moments
and
out
of
collegeday
nostalgia
sittin
on
the
curb
and
swillin
out
of
a
paper
bag
i
tried
cutting
it
some
slack
on
the
scores
but
still
o
e
be
some
nasty
isht
did
not
care
for
taste
worth
the
buzz
but
i
drink
beer
for
thirst
and
flavor
and
most
important
quality
this
beer
tasted
in
between
a
coors
light
and
a
tecate
would
not
buy
again
ill
stick
with
guinesses
and
redneck
side
of
my
blood
which
means
coors
or
keystone
light
stay
away
from
this
beer
ebonics
donts
missa
round
with
this
shit
really
if
i
wanted
to
drink
something
that
tasted
like
liquid
corn
id
wait
why
would
i
ever
want
to
drink
liquid
corn
feel
free
to
avoid
this
one
drink
this
as
cold
as
you
can
it
gets
nasty
the
warmer
it
gets
i
must
say
though
after
i
drank
this
my
stomach
was
mad
at
me
for
quite
a
bit
overall
i
dont
think
i
would
purchase
this
one
when
looking
for
a
malt
liquor
but
my
flashback
tour
of
the
malt
liqours
of
my
younger
days
is
barely
getting
started
i
give
colt
45
a
slight
edge
on
this
one
very
slight
though
this
was
on
sale
at
the
lcbo
for
3
50
since
im
also
buddies
with
most
of
the
people
their
they
sold
it
to
me
for
a
toonie
rather
surprised
i
was
buying
low
quality
beer
i
told
them
i
hadnt
tried
it
and
they
accepted
that
as
a
good
answer
since
this
is
malt
liquor
i
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
cant
comment
much
on
appearance
except
for
what
i
could
see
through
the
glass
little
browner
than
a
colt
45
when
swished
some
foam
would
appear
that
would
soon
quickly
disappear
smelled
alot
of
corn
cheap
malt
and
something
acidic
tasted
very
grainy
and
sweet
hey
is
this
candy
it
is
that
cloyingly
sweet
shitty
mouthfeel
too
much
cheap
malt
texture
with
a
corn
field
drinkable
for
drunks
and
whores
undrinkable
for
me
my
inlaws
had
a
40
of
this
stuff
in
the
fridge
that
they
bought
for
cooking
not
having
tried
it
in
decades
i
couldnt
resist
and
poured
a
glass
it
looks
like
a
basic
glass
of
beer
after
that
things
go
downhill
the
smell
is
grainy
corny
and
a
bit
acidic
with
no
real
redeeming
qualities
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
one
glass
did
a
number
on
the
stomach
this
wasnt
a
pleasant
experience
all
40
ounces
preserved
in
its
classic
presentation
olde
e
is
a
legendary
beer
yeah
right
this
beer
is
ghetto
swill
in
all
its
glory
made
famous
by
run
dmc
in
eighties
this
beer
pours
a
golden
similar
to
apple
juice
hue
pours
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
cloys
around
the
rim
of
my
mug
with
a
decent
head
retention
aroma
is
straight
up
unpleasant
all
cereal
grains
with
an
astringent
slightly
cooked
vegetable
scent
from
the
smell
you
would
think
this
stuff
could
take
of
some
layers
of
paint
from
the
wall
taste
is
highly
carbonated
watery
yet
acoholic
harsh
bitter
nasty
ass
taste
not
a
slow
sipper
chug
this
and
bypass
the
palate
this
beer
is
for
getting
folded
i
really
cant
tolerate
this
one
but
its
a
favorite
of
my
friends
so
in
closing
there
is
no
question
this
is
one
shitty
beer
watch
out
for
the
hangovers
this
beer
is
known
to
cause
in
my
opinion
steer
clear
22
oz
clear
bottle
purchased
for
1
09
the
drinkability
is
kinda
high
for
the
beer
style
this
brew
is
a
lot
less
metallic
and
chemical
tasting
than
the
others
i
just
thought
it
beats
out
all
it
competitors
in
the
macromalt
liquor
class
if
sublime
can
sing
about
it
its
gotta
be
good
at
any
rate
its
a
good
malt
liquor
has
a
nice
light
taste
to
it
it
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
to
it
with
a
white
head
goes
down
easy
but
can
get
rough
a
little
when
im
lookin
to
save
some
money
and
drink
a
little
this
is
what
i
usually
grab
for
sometimes
though
40oz
can
be
a
little
too
much
definately
a
good
buy
if
you
are
in
college
40
ounces
to
freedom
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
body
topped
by
a
frothy
bright
white
head
that
holds
surprisingly
well
and
drops
to
a
creamy
surface
covering
it
also
leaves
some
lace
in
the
glass
which
is
quite
unusual
considering
the
high
alcohol
although
i
doubt
thats
rarely
noticed
inside
the
40
oz
bottle
the
aroma
is
also
surprisingly
bold
but
with
a
distinct
cerealcooker
aroma
and
a
firm
touch
of
alcohol
there
is
some
grainy
maltiness
underneath
but
its
overshadowed
powerful
but
not
really
inviting
the
body
is
thinmedium
but
the
high
level
of
fine
carbonation
helps
it
to
become
creamy
immediately
thus
giving
the
impression
of
a
fuller
mouthfeel
the
residual
alcohol
thats
left
after
the
swallow
adds
to
that
impression
the
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
with
a
harsh
semigrainy
maltiness
rather
than
the
more
straightforward
sweet
malt
flavor
usually
found
in
malt
liquors
the
alcohol
also
lends
to
an
astringent
character
hop
bitterness
is
subdued
as
is
normally
the
case
with
malt
liquors
except
that
its
more
noteable
here
however
its
quite
dull
and
doesnt
add
anything
to
the
character
from
start
to
finish
this
beer
lacks
finesse
sure
its
bold
but
its
also
extremely
blunt
maybe
thats
why
people
like
it
in
a
way
i
can
see
how
this
could
be
less
cloying
as
it
doesnt
offer
the
bright
super
sweet
maltiness
of
many
malt
liquors
but
at
the
same
time
its
fairly
harsh
and
the
tradeoff
doesnt
seem
worth
it
disappointing
this
beer
deserves
to
be
wrapped
in
a
paper
bag
there
are
much
better
malt
liquors
on
the
market
take
a
step
up
to
the
coqui
900
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
medium
white
soapy
head
with
large
bubbles
the
smell
is
very
very
faint
with
no
discernable
aromas
first
taste
reveals
a
carb
bite
and
a
semisweet
very
faint
corn
taste
with
nothing
else
this
is
like
a
near
tastelessodorless
semihigh
alcohol
in
a
can
the
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
and
i
rate
the
drinkability
high
as
their
is
nothing
offensive
to
slow
you
down
very
little
to
say
about
this
beer
cheers
with
its
old
world
label
and
pee
like
color
i
was
enticed
to
one
more
time
embibe
one
this
is
just
pure
aweful
no
taste
or
substance
my
breath
smelled
like
i
was
hanging
out
with
winos
all
day
smells
like
the
subway
on
a
hot
day
i
cant
imagine
drinking
40oz
of
this
regularly
unfortunately
i
didnt
have
any
fallen
homies
to
tip
it
for
so
this
was
shared
between
4
people
i
know
we
are
so
ghetto
i
wonder
if
the
belgian
monks
tip
a
westy
when
they
lose
one
of
theirs
id
still
take
this
over
an
ab
product
any
day
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
watery
second
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
watery
and
on
and
on
and
on
did
i
forget
to
mention
that
i
think
that
this
beer
is
watery
look
i
really
would
like
to
give
readers
more
information
about
this
40oz
old
english
800
but
there
just
isnt
any
well
i
really
cant
add
too
much
that
already
hasnt
been
said
about
this
malt
liquor
its
not
horrible
but
the
adjunct
bite
is
a
little
hard
on
the
nostrils
and
taste
buds
and
considering
the
cool
people
that
have
been
reviewing
malt
liquors
lately
i
might
not
appreciate
this
fine
beverage
as
much
as
i
shouldcould
oe
is
a
quick
buzz
maker
for
those
who
drink
beer
primarily
to
get
juiced
and
in
my
case
a
way
to
administer
an
attitude
adjustment
after
a
hard
day
at
work
thanks
for
providing
this
sample
johnnyboy
medium
amber
with
slight
head
slight
carbonated
smooth
with
a
surprising
sweetness
slighty
more
malty
than
hoppy
but
otherwise
nicely
balanced
this
is
the
worst
malt
liquor
out
there
why
anyone
would
want
to
drink
any
of
this
crap
is
beyond
me
let
alone
40
ounces
of
pure
oe
piss
if
you
really
want
to
get
hammered
you
must
if
you
are
considering
this
then
go
get
st
ides
or
a
steel
both
have
more
alcohol
and
taste
better
this
stuff
blows
notes
yikes
this
is
some
harsh
stuff
it
is
more
than
a
chore
to
swill
down
40
ounces
of
this
many
names
have
been
given
to
this
brew
but
ghetto
juice
sticks
the
most
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
worst
but
one
of
the
most
talked
about
malt
liquors
celebrities
that
drink
this
style
of
beer
usually
drink
this
go
figure
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
on
rare
occasions
for
many
years
the
old
buzz
bomb
forties
arent
available
in
my
area
anymore
but
i
wish
they
were
it
is
what
it
is
and
it
aint
half
bad
this
is
my
go
to
beer
for
tomato
juice
beer
cocktails
o
considering
the
price
and
the
8
abv
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
granted
it
must
be
served
and
consumed
ice
cold
i
do
believe
this
is
one
of
the
better
high
gravitys
out
there
on
the
market
it
has
flavor
it
has
a
good
amount
of
lacing
poured
into
a
frosty
mug
even
though
it
was
a
40
ounce
bottle
that
i
dont
know
how
long
its
been
on
the
shelf
at
the
little
corner
market
i
visited
on
my
vacation
to
minnesota
it
was
not
skunky
and
tasted
bold
and
refreshing
in
my
opinion
to
each
there
own
this
is
better
to
me
than
the
traditional
olde
english
i
just
want
to
say
that
this
is
a
very
nice
malt
liquor
and
im
glad
that
i
could
try
it
if
its
one
of
those
days
where
you
want
to
drink
cheap
but
you
want
a
little
more
refinement
this
does
the
trick
had
this
in
a
24
ounce
can
purchased
this
at
sunset
liquors
in
madisonville
tn
appearance
is
a
dark
golden
character
smelled
like
corn
meets
grassy
overtones
tasted
like
a
rich
bready
mix
of
apples
and
a
little
bit
of
a
fruity
nose
mouthfeel
suggests
a
light
to
medium
bmc
with
more
of
a
malt
overtone
overall
a
good
8
1
aml
as
a
whole
it
is
very
decent
for
cheap
2
will
get
you
loaded
in
a
hurry

drink
this
when
cold
it
is
much
worse
when
it
gets
warm
and
when
warm
it
has
something
of
an
aftertaste
to
it
o
overall
good
for
the
price
and
one
forty

me
pretty
well
lit
if
youre
looking
for
something
to
sip
on
this

bad
choice

note
if
you
start
sobering
up
before
you
go
to
sleep
after
drinking
this
prepare
to
enter
hell
theres
no
going
back
and
theres
no
saving
you
filling
up
on
food
wont
even
help
good
luck
not
killing
yourself
what
is
it
in
hobo
beer
that
can
make
you
feel
so
terrible
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
with
a
nice
onefinger
creamy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
kinda
malty
grainyricy
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
grainyricy
light
body
not
too
bad
but
would
most
likey
not
try
again
overall
what
can
you
really
say
about
this
beer
its
pretty
gross
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
for
cheap
then
buy
a
olde
english
800
thats
all
its
good
for
notes
meh
not
overly
impressed
but
what
i
more
or
less
expected
average
high
gravity
malt
liquor
overly
sweet
with
corn
and
apple
and
alcohol
miller
you
have
won
pours
a
poor
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
head
no
lacing
smells
of
booze
and
sweet
corn
tastes
of
corn
bread
and
grain
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
quite
nasty
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
with
poor
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
the
best
d
i
had
my
fill
of
this
and
shared
it
with
friends
it
was
a
buddys
birthday
and
it
was
a
40s
party
all
agreed
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
malt
liquor
for
high
alcohol
malt
liquors
this
is
one
of
the
better
needless
to
say
it
goes
down
with
a
struggle
taste
smooth
as
you
throw
it
back
an
hour
later
my
40oz
is
gone
i
feel
buzzed
and
well
olde
english
done
me
well
somebody
in
one
of
the
forum
posts
about
cans
in
general
and
the
canquest
tm
in
particular
was
put
off
by
the
auditory
nature
of
cans
he
hated
the
glug
glug
glug
noise
associated
with
a
can
pour
if
you
can
believe
it
my
brother
when
they
package
beer
in
a
24
fluid
ounce
can
and
you
want
to
transfer
it
into
a
glass
with
a
minimum
of
spliiling
glug
is
all
youre
gonna
hear
i
had
a
whole
buncha
bonewhite
foam
as
the
result
of
trying
to
pour
into
the
glass
and
not
the
keyboard
but
lets
be
fair
and
honest
and
call
it
about
a
finger
with
good
retention
after
settling
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
closer
to
an
adjunct
lager
than
a
malt
liquor
it
was
honeysweet
underlain
with
whatev
there
was
a
little
of
the
fusel
sharpness
of
the
style
but
i
have
been
subjected
to
far
worse
in
this
epic
journey
believe
me
really
this
was
not
obnoxious
and
for
a
high
gravity
malt
liquor
that
is
saying
something
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
the
standard
sweetish
fuellike
intensity
of
the
style
finish
was
bonedry
and
i
began
to
wish
for
a
hammonds
pretzel
as
an
accompaniment
beautiful
heavy
lacing
throughout
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
by
any
means
but
this
was
pretty
dang
good
as
they
go
tone77
where
did
you
find
this
in
a
can
im
not
recommending
it
for
the
cooler
but
it
might
be
something
worthwhile
in
a
paper
bag
without
the
weight
of
glass
and
a
whole
40
to
oneself
ill
bet
im
the
high
reviewer
yo
sweet
and
corn
syrupy
thick
mouthfeel
i
already
know
i
wont
be
finishing
this
bottle
should
have
gotten
this
beast
ice
cold
first
i
dont
mind
some
regular
oe
every
once
in
a
long
while
but
this
is
not
really
all
that
fun
to
drink
sweetness
is
pretty
overwhelming
with
virtually
no
hops
to
help
the
only
other
flavors
i
am
getting
is
some
lager
yeast
sulfur
and
heavy
alcohol
carbonation
keeps
things
moving
along
better
when
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
pretty
foul
concoction
here
even
by
malt
liquor
standards
overall
a
medium
body
with
a
medium
to
full
finish
this
malt
liquor
actually
isnt
too
bad
the
alcohol
is
present
in
the
beer
but
not
too
overwhelming
since
i
already
consumed
the
kbs
i
had
wanted
to
be
my
100th
review
i
thought
a
gag
literally
review
would
be
funny
jokes
on
me
my
100th
review
ended
up
being
my
first
drain
pour
rjt
conclusion
we
were
having
crappy
beer
night
tonight
as
a
joke
my
wife
bought
bud
light
golden
wheat
and
i
bought
oe
as
a
joke
cos
id
never
had
it
and
im
doing
my
m
a
on
medieval
england
not
terrible
but
not
something
id
get
again
either
better
than
steel
poured
from
a
clear
40
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
malty
taste
is
a
combination
of
malts
corn
and
alcohol
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
d
i
dont
know
if
ill
ever
have
this
again
its
a
strong
malt
with
a
lot
of
bad
characteristics
not
terrible
but
certainly
not
worth
the
time
or
money
try
hurricane
or
dare
i
say
it
steel
reserve
from
the
40
oz
bottle
marked
aug3109do5111908
sampled
on
december
15
2009
after
looking
at
earlier
reviews
i
was
expecting
the
worst
but
quite
frankly
i
did
not
think
this
was
as
bad
as
all
that
the
pour
was
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
generous
supply
of
fizzy
head
the
aroma
was
of
mild
malts
and
hops
with
almost
no
noticeable
alcohol
which
tends
to
be
common
in
these
high
gravity
beers
the
taste
was
a
bit
tart
and
pungent
but
not
offensive
this
is
not
the
kind
of
beer
i
would
buy
regularly
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
review
it
was
tolerable
big
thumbs
down
for
me
appearance
from
this
big
olde
40oz
bottle
is
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
very
thin
head
and
no
lace
smell
is
corny
taste
is
sweet
with
somekind
of
chemical
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
light
medium
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
going
down
is
not
all
bad
considering
but
the
chemical
bitter
aftertaste
is
what
gets
me
looks
like
a
typical
malt
corn
yellow
with
little
head
the
smell
is
fusel
alcohol
with
a
metallic
bite
the
taste
is
about
the
same
fairly
strong
alcohol
taste
is
present
even
though
this
is
a
weaker
high
gravity
one
reviewer
said
that
this
is
the
only
40
that
he
can
get
hungover
by
after
drinking
i
agree
the
next
day
is
pretty
harsh
even
if
you
have
had
only
one
in
college
i
made
the
mistake
of
drinking
two
in
about
two
hours
and
was
wishing
for
death
the
rest
of
the
night
and
the
next
day
oh
my
the
old
englsh
high
gravity
this
is
going
to
be
a
doozy
it
is
a
viscous
golden
colored
liquid
with
a
very
poor
tanish
head
smells
very
grainy
and
has
some
harsh
alcohol
aromas
the
taste
is
also
strong
with
bad
alcohol
and
bitter
grains
a
medium
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
40oz
of
this
about
39oz
too
much
drinkability
the
standard
olde
english
800
was
chokedownable
but
this
this
is
just
plain
awful
they
couldnt
just
leave
the
oe800
alone
could
they
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
that
is
extremely
clear
not
much
head
not
much
lacing
and
below
average
carbonation
the
dominate
smell
is
light
hops
and
mild
malts
first
taste
is
light
very
sweet
and
lacking
in
flavor
not
much
body
at
all
not
much
taste
not
worth
your
time
this
is
basically
to
drink
when
you
just
want
some
booze
for
cheap
pours
the
way
it
looks
in
its
clear
bottle
golden
amber
color
with
a
tall
but
airy
white
head
that
settles
fast
it
smells
of
really
pungeant
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
these
flavors
arent
mixed
well
together
and
they
dont
really
mask
the
alcohol
at
all
it
has
a
sharp
mouthfeel
and
its
not
very
drinkable
should
be
avoided
unless
youre
a
broke
college
student
high
gravity
messes
you
more
if
you
are
into
that
type
of
thing
they
all
begin
to
look
like
movie
stars
oh
the
girls
all
get
prettier
at
closing
time
drunkablility

this
beer
poured
the
standard
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
1
inch
head
that
went
away
quickly
smell
was
also
pretty
standard
for
a
malt
liquor
corn
adjuncts
with
little
bit
of
a
fruity
odor
taste
was
ok
i
guess
also
fruity
with
just
barely
a
hint
of
malt
i
could
not
detect
hops
at
all
but
continued
to
taste
a
fruityness
that
kind
of
bordered
on
a
wine
cooler
all
this
beer
needed
was
a
splash
of
strawberry
extract
and
youve
got
boonfarms
pours
a
true
gold
crystal
clear
two
fingers
of
head
quickly
recede
to
alomost
nil
lacing
grain
and
adjunct
smell
with
the
common
malt
liquor
esters
and
a
faint
medicinal
scent
difficult
to
place
apple
esters
and
astringent
taste
are
the
only
flavors
present
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
the
clean
finish
and
smooth
mouthfeel
contrast
the
sharp
alcohol
bite
and
offflavors
but
are
not
enough
to
consider
this
a
decent
malt
liquor
the
color
is
a
dark
shade
of
honey
yellow
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
is
a
much
maltier
version
of
the
macro
cooked
vegetable
smell
the
taste
of
oe
hg
is
what
puts
this
beer
ahead
of
most
other
malt
liquors
the
flavor
has
a
fullbodied
thick
malt
sweetness
with
just
a
touch
of
adjunct
flavors
a
slight
alcohol
taste
comes
out
after
this
warms
up
a
bit
for
what
its
worth
this
is
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
on
the
market
with
a
flavor
comparable
to
steel
reserve
also
for
such
a
high
alcohol
lager
the
alcohol
taste
is
pretty
tame
presentation
packaged
in
a
40
ounce
clear
glass
bottle
with
a
screw
cap
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
not
drinkable
at
all
im
pouring
this
out
not
a
good
malt
liquor
at
all
i
poured
my
40oz
of
olde
e
hg
into
my
glass
and
prepare
to
plummet
into
a
familiar
drunk
but
without
my
warm
cozy
paper
bag
around
my
bottle
it
pours
a
nice
dark
amber
color
it
looks
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
and
it
actually
had
a
head
that
stuck
around
for
the
first
couple
of
minutes
it
smelled
a
bit
corny
but
this
is
a
malt
liquor
the
flavor
is
a
corny
sweetness
that
has
a
definite
alcohol
bite
at
the
end
since
there
is
not
enough
malts
or
hops
to
balance
it
out
but
again
this
is
a
malt
liquor
malt
liquors
are
not
my
favorite
but
every
so
often
i
get
brave
and
want
to
rekindle
my
relationship
with
beers
i
drank
when
i
was
younger
and
poorer
this
is
40oz
of
pure
hell
but
it
is
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
you
can
find
remember
to
pour
some
for
your
dead
homies
not
bad
at
all
for
a
high
gravity
malt
liquor
it
poured
a
darker
gold
color
than
most
of
this
style
but
with
the
same
fizzy
white
head
that
left
as
quickly
as
it
came
the
smell
was
adjunct
all
the
way
with
a
very
grainy
earthy
scent
that
was
not
too
pleasent
the
taste
was
better
than
expected
the
sweet
malt
dominated
the
flavor
with
a
bit
of
grain
flavor
and
an
underlying
aftertaste
of
alchohol
better
than
steele
reserve
any
day
but
then
again
that
isnt
saying
much
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
the
best
40
available
thats
not
necessarily
the
highest
praise
but
on
occassion
when
cash
is
tight
a
40
is
a
nice
option
this
is
not
nearly
as
common
as
its
nonhigh
gravity
cousin
in
fact
i
usually
have
a
hard
time
finding
it
the
beer
is
a
dark
golden
color
when
consumed
out
of
the
bottle
some
head
is
stirred
up
the
smell
is
somewhat
unpleasant
it
is
reminiscent
of
burnt
vegetables
the
taste
is
slightly
astringent
but
it
goes
down
smooth
enough
in
fact
i
think
it
has
a
unique
and
fairly
pleasant
flavor
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
the
alcohol
definitely
starts
to
get
to
you
and
if
you
take
your
time
finishing
it
the
warm
remnants
become
extremely
unpleasant
gotta
keep
this
one
cold
the
only
reason
olde
english
is
so
sucessful
as
that
it
is
a
quick
way
to
get
drunk
the
taste
is
awful
in
the
beginning
but
the
more
you
drink
the
more
you
will
get
used
to
it
comes
out
of
a
40
oz
bottle
dont
know
how
it
pours
seems
odd
to
pour
a
oe
in
a
glass
the
smell
is
high
octane
malty
meat
the
taste
isnt
to
bad
once
you
are
used
to
it
drink
two
of
these
and
you
fell
great
so
not
very
drinkable
this
is
a
nice
big
manly
brew
if
you
dont
like
it
you
could
still
drink
it
to
put
hair
on
your
chest
whoa
one
just
sprouted
its
very
similar
to
the
original
oe
but
stronger
alc
and
better
taste
its
taste
is
a
bit
more
pungent
with
hops
barley
corn
and
sugar
the
alcohol
though
stronger
is
hardly
even
there
taste
wise
i
had
to
go
to
a
seedy
store
to
get
it
and
that
was
the
only
drawback
now
that
i
am
on
my
quest
for
great
malt
liquors
i
have
to
go
to
seedy
stores
i
guess
thats
part
of
being
an
extreme
ba
thanks
goodness
it
comes
in
a
huge
bottle
so
i
can
drink
it
for
a
while
just
a
simple
yellow
color
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
smells
of
alcohol
and
sweetness
not
very
good
at
all
you
can
taste
no
hops
a
little
malt
but
there
is
a
horrible
overpowering
flavor
that
i
cannot
place
it
is
foul
and
metallic
and
skunky
and
full
of
alcohol
not
good
at
all
the
body
is
a
clear
yellow
when
held
to
the
light
but
appears
more
amber
in
the
glass
its
creamy
bright
white
head
holds
surprisingly
well
for
a
beer
with
so
much
alcohol
and
it
slowly
drops
to
a
thin
surface
covering
leaving
some
nice
lace
at
the
outset
sweet
very
lightly
grainy
malt
greets
you
in
the
nose
with
a
very
delicate
fruitiness
its
quite
clean
its
mediumborderingonfull
bodied
with
a
fine
carbonation
thats
lightly
effervescent
and
gently
caresses
the
tongue
crisp
yet
smooth
the
flavor
delivers
a
lightly
grainy
maltiness
thats
somewhat
surprising
as
most
examples
as
so
obviously
adjunct
laden
and
its
sweetness
is
tempered
more
by
its
alcohol
than
its
lowkey
bitterness
it
finishes
drying
despite
its
sweet
malt
with
a
wash
of
drying
alcohol
and
dull
bitterness
although
some
malt
does
linger
overall
its
a
surprisingly
clean
and
wellmade
malt
liquor
that
probably
deserves
a
little
more
respect
than
it
gets
bronze
color
nice
big
thick
head
when
poured
into
a
glass
some
cooked
cornadjunct
aroma
not
unpleasant
full
bodied
and
a
fairly
smooth
mouthfeel
the
taste
wavers
back
and
forth
from
corn
to
corn
syrup
a
pretty
harsh
alcohol
bite
after
an
overly
sweet
burnt
sugar
taste
and
after
swallowing
a
burning
sensation
of
alcohol
settling
in
the
stomach
at

0
abv
this
brew
is
designed
to
do
one
thing
and
that
is
to
get
you
buzzing
hard
and
fast
it
might
be
a
good
beer
to
soak
bratwurst
in
before
grilling
otherwise
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
its
not
terrible
but
be
careful
one
forty
should
be
enough
in
one
sitting
i
only
drank
this
as
part
of
a
dare
and
when
i
had
no
money
an
outlier
at
1
laughable
man
i
hope
that
is
a
born
on
date
or
i
am
tasting
an
aged
version
of
this
beer
malt
liquors
can
make
you
wince
with
the
metallic
taste
and
overly
rambunctious
corn
and
grain
characters
there
is
a
bit
of
that
here
but
this
is
not
cloying
or
rancid
it
is
really
smooth
if
more
malt
liquors
were
like
this
one
id
be
drinking
a
lot
of
them
sorry
previous
raters
and
ba
members
i
have
to
score
it
much
higher
than
you
did
the
true
budget
malt
liquor
for
the
budget
minded
consumer
who
wants
the
most
bang
for
his
buck
but
wont
settle
on
steel
reserve
it
is
just
as
a
malt
liquor
should
be
cheap
adjunct
to
hell
and
with
just
enough
hops
to
provide
a
level
of
bitterness
and
contrast
to
the
beer
that
its
noticeable
but
definitely
not
enough
to
break
the
brewers
bank
the
overall
result
is
a
very
sweet
and
enjoyable
malt
liquor
that
really
finishes
clean
and
has
an
enjoyable
taste
but
really
is
nothing
special
for
the
price
but
will
definitely
quench
your
thirst
and
give
you
the
budget
buzz
you
were
looking
for
wish
i
could
rate
it
higher
but
country
club
xxx
and
king
cobra
had
more
going
on
then
this
malt
liquor
would
recommend
if
you
cant
afford
old
e
800
or
if
your
store
doesnt
have
genesee
at
the
very
least
but
not
bad
for
the
price
and
much
better
then
hurricane
or
steel
reserve
miller
magnum
25
o
im
not
going
to
lie
i
drink
my
fair
share
of
malt
liquor
after
a
shitty
day
at
work
i
am
used
to
the
8
percent
varieties
this
just
tastes
like
an
adjunct
lager
o
overall
not
a
terrible
malt
liquor
it
does
its
job
at
the
price
youd
expect
to
pay
big
thanks
goes
out
to
the
ba
who
sent
me
this
one
as
an
extra
just
because
he
saw
it
on
my
wants
even
attached
a
postit
note
taped
to
it
that
said
saw
this
on
your
wants
haha
keeping
it
classy
served
from
24
oz
can
into
a
mikkeller
oversized
wine
glass
have
to
try
to
class
it
up
some
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
corn
grain
and
sugar
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
corn
sugar
alcohol
and
water
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
pretty
bad
brew
i
have
to
say
that
this
was
a
pretty
nice
looking
brew
but
i
knew
not
to
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
here
as
this
brew
likely
had
a
hidden
side
boy
was
i
right
on
that
one
the
aroma
was
not
that
great
on
this
one
as
there
was
a
fairly
large
sugary
aspect
going
on
with
it
the
flavor
was
more
of
the
same
with
more
dilution
as
a
previous
review
said
this
was
very
mild
and
it
being
in
a
can
format
would
make
it
fun
to
shotgun
at
a
college
frat
party
believe
me
i
was
there
once
another
tick
from
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
list
with
plenty
more
to
go
perfect
malt
liquor
for
the
collegebum
set
o
this
is
really
just
a
concentrated
or
ice
version
of
high
life
i
dont
find
that
surprising
as
it
seems
mostly
everything
miller
sells
is
just
a
variation
on
a
theme
it
hits
really
weak
for
something
that
is
supposedly
6
0
never
overrate
your
abv
in
this
market
taste
is
disappointing
after
the
decent
appearance
and
delicious
malt
liquor
smell
that
oldschool
malt
liquor
taste
is
there
but
its
really
quite
light
it
just
tastes
like
high
carbonation
and
stale
grains
mostly
oh
well
id
say
its
an
average
malt
liquor
boring
but
not
offensive
like
some
of
the
newer
higher
alcohol
malt
liquors
i
wont
buy
it
again
when
olde
english
and
schlitz
o
m
l
are
easily
attainable
and
far
superior
decided
to
pick
one
of
these
up
since
theyre
practically
free
right
now
ay
my
corner
store
im
not
sure
why
because
it
doesnt
even
look
tasty
but
well
see
brownish
yellow
liquid
with
some
sudsing
on
top
from
the
ride
home
in
my
bike
bag
smells
really
really
sweet
and
of
corn
and
grain
sugary
fruity
flavor
with
unpleasant
bitter
undertones
feels
a
bit
watery
especially
for
malt
liquor
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
overall
drinkability
meh
theres
only
one
product
named
magnum
that
one
should
be
proud
of
buying
and
this
isnt
it

warning
one

and
i
was
pulled
out
of
my
afternoon
reverie
a
bag
of
fritos
smells
less
like
corn
than
this
gem
holy
awful
batman
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
heat
on
the

that
fullon
got
my
attention
oh
me
oh
my
oh
shit
oh
dear
my
brain
felt
like
it
was
being
cooked
in
the
shell
and
my
eyes
were
beginning
to
alternately
bug
out
and
roll
back
no
wonder
the
downandout
crowd
looks
the
way
that
they
do
if
this
is
a
standard

jesus
but
i
want
to
ram
my
head
through
a
wall
just
to
make
the
voices
shut
up
for
a
fking
millisecond
i
hear
them
all
the
time
but
never
as
loudly
or
as
clearly
as
i
do
with
this
winner
a
previous
reviewer
mentioned
giving
money
to
the
unfortunates
who
may
be
drinking
this
on
the
street
hell
this
makes
me
want
to
tithe
woody
at
lee
ermey
the
therapists
office
magnum
40
really
makes
me
sad
l
e
thats
very
interesting
you
know
what
makes
me
sad
you
squiddly
diddly
piece
of
dung
this
beer
lets
go
get
a
craft
beer
and
tell
some
sea
stories
yeah
man
after
this
i
was
ready
for
a
beer
the
finish
was
dry
bone
dry
and
i
could
feel
smoke
rolling
out
of
my
ear
holes
as
my
brain
melted
into
the
background
all
i
need
is
some
crack
or
crystal
meth
and
the
afternoon
will
be
complete
tastes
of
rubbing
alcohol
and
fusel
alcohol
as
well
carbonation
or
hops
cant
tell
abrasive
bitterness
coming
from
the
alcohol
take
a
miller
high
life
and
age
it
in
some
vodka
and
you
get
this
beer
damn
id
be
tempted
to
give
a
bum
some
money
if
i
saw
him
drinking
one
of
these
good
for
frat
parties
a
quick
buzz
or
teenagers
who
think
natty
is
good
beer
overall
it
is
above
average
for
a
malt
liquor
but
not
great
this
is
a
40
of
malt
liquor
its
not
that
bad
when
its
cold
you
can
down
half
the
bottle
pretty
quick
no
weird
bitter
taste
its
kind
of
like
cheap
miller
lite
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
so
you
can
drink
it
quicker
just
drink
half
the
bottle
put
it
in
the
freezer
for
20
minutes
then
drink
the
rest
rjt
not
a
lot
to
see
when
poured
in
my
mug
very
light
yellow
rating
a
4
on
the
srm
chart
fluffy
pure
white
head
that
fizzled
down
to
a
light
lacing
around
the
edge
of
my
mug
light
sweet
smell
of
malt
and
corn
nothing
special
here
not
much
flavor
at
all
cant
put
my
tongue
on
any
real
taste
except
wet
corn
very
little
in
the
mouth
feel
category
also
one
step
above
water
quite
bland
because
of
the
lack
of
taste
i
guess
it
could
go
with
anything
but
would
not
add
to
the
dining
experience
or
enhance
any
other
flavors
it
is
wet
and
will
quench
your
thirst
when
coming
in
from
heavy
yard
work
and
yes
it
will
give
you
a
buzz
but
if
you
are
looking
for
flavor
look
somewhere
else
much
better
cold
taste
a
little
more
like
straw
as
it
warms
i
guess
i
could
offer
it
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
keep
a
party
going
but
not
something
i
would
buy
for
a
flavor
experience
d
not
very
good
even
by
malt
liquor
standards
you
get
what
you
pay
forcould
be
a
whole
lot
worse
ive
had
some
bad
beers
in
my
life
but
man
this
one
is
coming
close
to
takign
the
cake
weak
nose
pissy
colour
even
weaker
taste
lacing
is
lacking
to
say
the
least
the
only
thing
that
is
really
redeemable
about
this
is
the
incredibly
cheap
price
one
dollar
sure
ill
take
it
if
i
were
a
bum
and
as
one
of
the
bros
would
point
out
freshness
date
hell
no
this
piss
dont
need
no
stinkin
frehsness
date
taste
is
light
sweet
malts
and
a
mild
shot
of
alcohol
body
is
extremely
light
for
a
malt
liquor
it
is
pretty
clean
without
alot
of
offputting
fruitiness
i
actually
prefer
my
malt
liquor
to
pack
a
bit
more
whollop
than
a
mere
6
the
alcohol
presence
is
featherweight
in
this
beer
easy
to
drink
but
not
my
ml
of
choice
d
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
this
is
average
as
far
as
beer
goes
this
is
pretty
terrible
poured
from
a
clear
40
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
corn
taste
is
mostly
of
alcohol
some
notes
of
malts
and
corn
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
about
average
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
poured
from
a
40
ounce
bottle
into
a
0
5
litre
pilsener
glass
i
bought
in
munich
smell
was
sweet
and
grainy
head
was
so
small
or
unimportant
or
of
so
little
consequence
as
to
warrant
little
or
no
attention
smell
was
obtuse
with
characteristics
of
grain
color
was
sallow
taste
was
disagreeabl
mouthfeel
was
without
merit
drinkability
you
got
to
be
kidding
if
you
like
hiigh
abv
and
a
cheap
price
1
29
plus
tax
in
louisiana
and
you
are
real
thristy
this
brew
is
a
bargain
d
if
you
absolutely
are
broke
if
you
cant
afford
one
good
real
beer
then
drink
this
cold
chug
it
fast
and
you
should
be
ok
until
you
can
get
quality
you
can
enjoy
its
not
good
but
the
last
two
times
ive
had
it
it
was
worse
i
dont
know
why
maybe
im
in
a
better
mood
moral
of
this
story
is
if
you
want
to
drink
a
40
get
mickeys
or
cobra
or
anything
dont
get
this
since
they
all
cost
the
same
anyway
i
dont
recommend
this
one
very
light
yellow
with
a
slight
white
head
smells
of
corn
flakes
and
wimpy
hops
tastes
like
an
even
sweeter
version
of
most
macro
lagers
with
noticeable
alcoholic
warmth
in
the
finish
even
though
the
abv
is
mild
for
the
style
watery
mouthfeelhighly
carbonated
this
brew
gets
pretty
nasty
as
it
warms
up
not
worth
the
time
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
that
actuslly
laces
the
glass
aroma
is
pretty
much
standard
for
a
malt
liquor
taste
is
watery
and
sweet
but
in
an
unoffensive
way
i
would
actually
go
to
say
this
might
be
the
best
malt
liquor
ive
had
i
usually
dont
drink
malt
liquors
but
i
saw
it
at
the
store
and
thought
i
havent
reviewed
this
one
yetand
it
actually
turned
out
to
be
a
pleasant
surprise
yes
i
am
reviewing
a
forty
of
malt
liquor
what
about
it
first
pour
a
little
out
for
my
lost
hommies
then
into
my
glass
this
beer
was
a
lemonyellow
color
like
floor
cleaner
the
head
was
white
very
short
lived
and
left
only
minimal
lacing
off
the
ring
the
aroma
was
musty
skunky
malt
and
general
unpleasantry
like
the
underside
of
your
grandfathers
couch
cushion
the
flavor
was
not
quite
so
bad
in
fact
it
seemed
to
be
designed
to
be
inoffensive
watery
pale
malt
with
hints
of
hops
to
balance
and
some
alcohol
ester
sweetness
very
little
there
ok
mouthfeel
and
a
light
chugable
body
good
beer
no
but
that
is
not
what
it
was
made
for
d
not
bad
for
what
it
is
if
i
was
headed
out
to
a
party
and
wanted
to
drink
beer
on
the
cheap
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
pours
up
a
yellow
straw
color
with
a
white
bubbly
head
surprisingly
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
slight
metallic
corn
malt
very
subtle
crisp

character
the
taste
is
macnasty

wooh
i
havent
had
a
40
in
a
while
brings
me
back
to
the
roots
gotta
love
it
drinkability
is
for
that
cheap
buzz
and
cheap
bang
for
your
buck
its
not
bad
but
not
worth
buying
unless
youre
hard
on
the
dough
another
original
from
miller
brewing
company
this
is
porbably
one
of
their
worst
creations
ever
it
was
a
fizzy
yellow
liquid
with
a
weak
head
smells
like
dried
corn
and
alcohol
taste
is
similar
mmm
bitter
feed
corn
the
body
was
syrupy
and
resulted
in
very
poor
drinkablility
an
awefull
beer
if
this
is
something
that
one
goes
out
to
find
to
have
a
good
decent
drink
this
is
the
wrong
area
to
look
if
forties
are
your
sort
of
drink
there
is
so
much
more
than
this
beer
just
stay
away
from
the
beer
if
this
comes
into
the
scene
drink
one
then
you
are
done
otherwise
stay
away
only
thing
good
for
is
getting
drunk
for
cheap
in
my
opinion
69
recommended
magnum
really
isnt
that
bad
because
it
really
doesnt
have
that
much
flavor
smell
and
taste
are
fleeting
and
the
color
is
about
what
you
would
expect
out
of
a
beer
called
magnum
40
the
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
and
when
ice
cold
very
easy
to
drink
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
puffy
white
head
that
was
quickly
vanished
smell
is
very
minimal
with
only
a
generic
sweetish
beer
aroma
taste
is
also
sweet
but
very
restrained
finishes
refreshing
when
ice
cold
but
starts
to
lose
its
acceptance
as
it
slowly
warms
the
40
ounce
bottle
is
best
to
share
with
friends
so
that
it
stays
cold
before
being
finished

i
kinda
like
it
though
if
youre
in
the
mood
or
if
youre
tight
on
cash
you
could
do
much
worse
than
this
the
drinkability
is
hard
for
me
dont
even
think
i
will
finish
whats
in
mky
glass
honestly
i
didnt
mind
this
40
oz
too
much
it
isnt
a
good
beer
but
it
could
have
been
a
lot
worse
appearance
is
fairly
dark
for
a
malt
liquor
not
great
looking
but
usually
they
appear
a
little
more
watery
smell
is
adjunct
same
as
about
all
other
macros
taste
is
smooth
with
a
nice
mildly
sweet

never
did
i
taste
the
alcohol
in
this
one
overall
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
and
above
average
for
a
macro
malt
liquor
not
something
id
buy
for
a
craft
session
but
occaisionally
a
malt
liquor
feels
right
drinkabilitynotes
its
hard
to
be
disappointed
with
this
beer
because
it
is
so
inexpensive
i
paid
1
59
plus
tax
for
a
40ounce
bottle
even
as
a
poor
quality
beer
it
is
a
good
value
for
the
money
and
a
better
value
than
many
of
the
american
macros
if
you
invest
2
00
in
this
beer
and
have
reasonable
expectations
it
is
at
least
decent
although
there
are
far
better
malt
liquors
to
be
had
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
no
skunk
and
presence
of
an
actual
flavor
make
it
superior
to
an
average
american
macrobrewed
beer
i
think
the
only
reason
that
i
am
even
rating
this
beer
slightly
high
for
a
malt
liquor
is
due
primarily
to
the
fact
that
it
is
extremely
cheap
and
actually
isnt
too
bad
believe
it
or
not
i
as
a
college
student
would
prefer
this
over
many
of
the
cheaper
anheuiser
busch
products
forty
ounce
bottle
it
poured
a
thin
clear
yellow
with
little
head
the
smell
was
nothing
but
skunk
terrible
the
taste
was
grainy
with
corn
rice
and
alcohol
there
was
no
hint
of
malt
this
has
no
right
being
called
a
malt
liquer
horrible
never
buy
this
crap
update
2904
i
got
magnum
again
moneys
tight
and
i
didnt
dislike
it
as
much
as
i
used
to
still
tastes
like
burnt
corn
and
alcohol
but
didnt
offend
me
as
much
as
it
used
to
even
worth
trying
oh
god
4
ozs
is
enough
of
this
monstrosity
the
other
36
are
going
down
the
drain
i
think
only
serious
alkies
with
a
severe
nasal
condition
could
drink
this
trash
miller
hang
your
collective
heads
in
shame
clear
yellow
hue
minimal
animation
smallish
brilliant
white
head
bubbly
and
underdeveloped
fair
retention
the
nose
is
strongly
sweet
and
alcoholic
definitely
polluted
with
adjuncts
not
inviting
the
palate
is
surprisingly
clean
slightly
sweet
kind
of
creamy
similar
to
creamed
corn
the
alcohol
is
a
lot
less
noticeable
in
the
taste
a
major
plus
the
finish
is
short
and
sweet
pun
intended
the
complexity
is
minimal
but
the
simplicity
works
well
with
this
malt
liquor
the
carbonation
is
moderate
mediumlight
mouthfeel

very
easy
to
drink
a
solid
beverage
for
they
style
i
still
doubt
id
drink
it
again
its
very
cheap
i
would
certainly
recomend
this
brew
to
any
college
students
who
have
finished
writing
those
finals
when
i
think
of
magnum
i
normally
picture
champgne
not
with
this
swill
thank
goodnees
it
has
a
decent
abv
because
i
can
not
stomach
more
than
a
few
ounces
it
has
that
pee
color
to
it
and
that
great
industrial
taste
it
is
a
good
buzz
for
the
money
break
break
crystal
palace
this
is
drop
kick
we
have
a
mass
of
beer
foam
headed
towards
omaha
ne
notes
on
the
bottle
is
says
magnum
premium
premium
compared
to
what
a
substandard
malt
liquor
lots
of
rough
edges
and
tough
to
put
down
needless
to
say
i
had
a
hard
time
consuming
all
of
it
one
of
the
cheapest
40s
you
can
get
usually
around
1
50
a
pop
very
light
in
color
definitely
cheap
by
its
taste
but
not
as
bad
as
some
other
malts
that
ive
had
very
good
if
you
want
something
cheap
to
take
on
a
fishing
or
camping
for
the
week
end
but
is
also
not
bad
for
the
price
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
going
in
no
reall
offensiveness
and
the
booze
is
hidden
it
doesnt
taste
like
much
at
all
but
that
gets
boring
real
quick
i
can
see
why
people
buy
these
i
wonder
if
the
others
will
have
more
flavor
for
better
or
worse
cant
be
as
bad
as
stone

get
stung
drank
a
couple
pints
today
for
old
times
sake
still
does
the
job
and
i
feel
is
one
of
the
tastier
malt
liquors
first
time
i
had
it
in
a
16
oz
can
so
that
was
cool
six
pack
of
grenades
plus
dungeons
and
dragons
equals
successful
campaign
o
mickeys
is
okay
i
hate
house
of
pain
for
mentioning
this
swill
in
a
songwhich
subsequently
made
me
buy
and
drink
it
had
this
one
in
a
grenade
bottle
even
as
a
novice
college
drinker
could
tell
this
was
piss
not
good
at
all
but
expected
o
tastes
like
every
other
malt
liquor
drinkable
but
not
good
i
like
it
i
dont
give
a
flying
fig
about
the
score
here
it
only
supports
my
belief
that
most
scorers
are
worse
than
me
and
sitting
on
a
curb
will
get
you
the
truth
sometimes
f
you
snob
beerhipsters
its
cheap
and
gets
the
job
done
if
you
want
to
get
a
buzz
in
the
middle
of
the
day
dafuq
why
once
the
alcohol
destroys
your
palate
it
allows
you
to
get
past
the
chemicals
used
to
make
this
atrocity
once
the
alcohol
hits
your
brain
you
tend
not
to
give
a
shit
low

abv
i
had
two
8ers
yeasterday
and
i
didntmfeel
this
buzzed
must
be
the
impurities
giving
me
instant
hangover
i
hate
you
miller
i
dont
know
why
mickeys
has
such
a
low
rating
i
like
it
a
lot
of
low
ratings
but
i
like
this
one
once
in
awhile
nice
change
of
pace
from
timetotime
away
from
the
ipas
and
spicedup
stuff
i
lived
off
two
dolla
foties
of
st
ides
back
in
college
for
f
sake
so
mickeys
is
likedom
perignone
for
me
no
way
jose
no
way
no
no
no
no
no
okay
its
better
than
most
malt
liquers
i
feel
like
mickeys
fools
me
twice
when
i
drink
it
i
get
fooled
once
by
getting
tricked
into
those
dumbass
riddles
they
put
on
the
caps
i
get
fooled
twice
because
i
end
up
drinking
the
malt
sludge
in
the
grenade
because
i
feel
stupid
for
not
figuring
out
the
phrase
butter
face
when
dave
grohl
sang
the
line
is
someone
getting
the
best
of
you

verdict
meh
starts
off
merely
inoffensive
and
goes
downhill
from
there
im
not
sure
whose
tastes
this
is
made
for
but
dont
really
see
this
as
a
session
beer
just
too
sweet
in
my
estimation
dhannesjun
10
because
it
drinks
better
than
bud
light
but
its
already
disappearing
just
full
of
adjuncts
and
other
crap
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
it
just
goes
down
and
before
you
know
it
the
glass
is
gone
overall
im
sure
not
many
could
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
a
euro
pale
lager
in
a
blind
lineup
decent
and
a
good

was

that
apple

d
this

drinkable
flows
down
to
the
gullet
quick
as
you
like
not
a
quality
beer
at
all
almost
devoid
of
flavor
but
again
oh
so
easy
to
drink
i
guess
it
caters
to
a
certain
audience
will
buy
this
again
for
times
i
want
to
slum
it
appearance
is
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
crisp
head
and
fair
lace
for
a
malt
liquor
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
corn
yeasty
with
hops
taste
has
the
adjunct
flavor
to
it
a
little
metallic
and
stale
hops
mouthfeel
is
is
light
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
not
one
i
would
willingly
buy
again
it
kinda
left
a
light
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
i
didnt
quite
care
for
due
to
no
overpowering
complexities
this
beer
is
good
for
the
swill
mowing
the
lawn
or
bbqing
instead
you
get
a
rich
profile
of
pleasant
adjuncts
with
big
nodes
of
corn
and
grain
this
is
balanced
off
with
mundane
hop
essence
nothing
great
but
honestly
i
guess
i
just
like
the
taste
of
beer
poured
from
a
green
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
has
a
sweet
malty
smell
taste
is
rather
bland
not
bad
but
not
very
flavorfull
feels
watery
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
an
average
malt
liquor
conclusion
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
this
because
of
slc
punk
um
thats
about
all
i
can
say
about
it
its
a
drinkable
malt
liquor
that
is
all
lets
cut
to
the
chase
this
is
a
freaking
mickeys
malt
liquor
not
a
westy
12
for
a
malt
liquor
this
isnt
all
that
bad
lets
face
it
if
you
wanted
something
better
you
wouldnt
have
reached
for
the
mickeys
in
the
first
place
but
what
you
get
is
solid
malt
liquor
flavor
without
that
nasty
malt
liquor
after
taste
you
get
with
most
of
them
this
isnt
gold
people
but
its
pretty
good
when
its
free
in
a
22oz
bottle
who
knew
it
seems
like
youre
really
taking
the
slow
option
to
getting
crunked
with
this
stuff
but
id
imagine
it
is
less
likely
to
produce
severe
hangovers
d
i
think
i
could
handle
about
one
40
a
year
i
like
oe
better
pours
golden
yellow
with
nearly
no
head
smells
pretty
clean
a
little
grainy
not
too
fuselly
like
a
lot
of
malt
liquors
theres
a
bit
of
a
corny
finish
to
him
but
its
not
overbearing
highly
carbonated
it
tastes
more
like
an
american
adjunct
lager
my
go
to
guy
for
40s
goes
good
with
mcdoubles
cinco
de
mayo
and
i
should
have
had
something
mexican
but
instead
i
drank
a
mickeys
fine
malt
liquor
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
with
a
lot
of
bubbly
carbonation
and
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
has
somethig
slightly
floral
to
it
rather
than
malty
watery
mouthfeel
and
nothing
special
there
the
taste
has
some
vague
hops
to
it
but
little
in
the
way
of
malts
as
should
be
the
case
for
a
malt
liquor
this
is
a
get
drunk
beer
and
little
more
d
not
so
much
i
regret
having
bought
this
although
i
would
drink
this
compared
to
say
a
bud
light
but
i
had
to
give
it
a
shot
not
only
do
you
get
a
nice
buzz
from
this
but
if
you
get
the
grenadeshornets
the
short
fat
12ozers
the
caps
have
picture
puzzles
that
you
can
pass
around
to
see
who
can
figure
it
out
cheers
not
bad
i
was
expecting
worse
but
this
really
isnt
a
bad
example
its
drinkable
for
what
it
is
drinkability
no
thanks
its
a
shame
they
redesigned
the
container
getting
cut
by
those
peelback
metal
tabs
was
part
of
the
fun
12oz
green
short
bottle
from
hannaford
pours
a
light
yellow
crystal
clear
body
with
a
half
inch
of
shortlived
white
head
smells
like
cereal
grains
a
touch
of
butter
and
hints
of
floral
hops
slightly
sweet
cereal
grain
hints
of
caramel
finishes
very
clean
as
expected
very
light
in
body
with
ample
effervescent
carbonation
super
drinkable
and
really
nothing
objectionable
about
it
not
even
skunked
despite
the
green
bottle
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
i
have
tried
overall
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
i
think
it
ranks
right
up
their
with
old
e
out
of
a
squat
12
fl
oz
bottle
this
fine
malt
liquor
was
a
perfectly
clear
light
straw
gold
color
the
head
was
off
white
short
lived
and
left
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
was
actually
decent
slightly
sweet
pale
malt
stale
malt
and
some
corny
grain
the
flavors
were
also
clearly
sweetened
to
mask
the
alcohol
still
for
a
malt
liquor
it
was
indeed
fairly
fine
pale
malt
hints
of
hops
and
a
general
wet
grainy
quality
the
usual
musty
and
stale
characteristics
were
there
but
underplayed
the
mouthfeel
was
slightly
above
average
but
slick
the
carbonation
good
and
the
body
mediumlight
would
i
recommend
it
in
a
pinch
yes
better
than
most
of
its
brethren
and
generally
palatable
drank
straight
from
the
widemouth
green
stubby
bottle
as
it
was
meant
to
be
this
beer
is
surprisingly
not
bad
i
think
theres
some
truth
to
the
bottles
fine
malt
liquor
label
because
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
this
isnt
that
far
behind
rogue
fancypants
dads
little
helper
in
terms
of
flavor
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
dull
pbr
it
just
has
gentle
bready
malts
behind
a
vague
sweetness
completely
drinkable
and
inoffensive
worth
a
try
just
because
its
mickeys
oh
mickeys
how
you
remind
me
of
high
school
grenade
time
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
left
decent
lacing
surprisingly
aroma
is
all
corn
and
adjunct
with
the
lightest
possible
amount
of
hops
but
still
somewhat
noticeable
grainy
and
dry
on
the
tongue
only
hints
of
sweetness
on
the
back
end
before
turning
dry
again
graininess
and
corn
is
about
all
there
is
to
say
about
this
one
its
not
as
good
out
of
a
glass
as
it
is
directly
from
the
grenade
probably
the
only
malt
liquor
i
can
handle
drinking
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
its
a
hit
one
after
another
this
a
great
beer
to
take
to
a
party
and
enjoy
all
night
d
i
wouldnt
even
drink
this
if
i
just
got
done
mowing
the
grass
on
120
degree
day
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
two
finger
white
head
aroma
is
of
barley
and
malt
with
some
hops
mixed
in
taste
is
malty
and
bitter
aftertaste
is
like
stale
cereal
grains
carbonated
mouthfeel
but
otherwise
average
texture
not
recommended
as
a
session
beer
brain
grenades
the
term
we
used
to
describe
these
funky
green
globes
of
potent
power
leave
it
to
old
friends
to
revisit
these
dangerous
beauties
back
in
the
day
we
used
to
slam
these
taking
bets
on
who
could
finish
the
grenade
in
the
least
amount
of
sips
regardless
here
i
am
and
not
much
changes
funky
malt
likka
scent
sweet
and
very
grainy
appearance
heh
just
keep
it
in
the
bottle
which
is
sweeeet
tacky
and
sticky
on
the
palate
it
bites
ya
tastes
like
tomorrows
stale
ale
overall
not
a
quality
brew
but
a
fun
past
time
in
certain
circumstances
if
you
want
to
hammer
a
few
malt
liquors
you
can
do
this
not
my
thing
but
cheap
for
college
kids
i
guess
tasted
in
the
hand
grenade
bottle
with
the
little
puzzles
on
the
cap
while
watching
a
ufc
fight
for
the
sole
reason
because
mickeys
is
one
of
their
sponsors
and
the
hornet
looks
pissed
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
it
could
be
worse
and
this
one
is
surprisingly
sweet
reminds
me
of
college
d
very
drinkable
priced
right
for
the
quick
buzz
id
much
rather
drink
a
few
mickeys
than
any
ice
beer
for
a
quick
buzz
mickeys
truley
is
fine
malt
liquor
12
oz
grenade
which
i
chose
not
to
pour
into
a
glass
smells
of
corn
and
a
little
malt
the
taste
is
of
adjuct
corn
and
rice
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
for
the
style
and
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
beer
is
quite
refreshing
and
unoffensive
i
survived
the
first
stage
without
any
major
wounds
well
resume
the
brown
paper
bag
invite
tomorrow
night
ok
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
stuff
back
in
the
70s
along
with
a
lot
of
imports
and
the
few
american
brews
that
were
tasty
back
then
ie
ballantine
xxx
rainier
ale
sierra
nevada
anchor
new
albionlong
since
gone
others
that
escape
my
memory
right
now
and
i
still
like
this
darn
malt
liquor
and
i
dont
think
its
changed
much
since
it
was
a
heileman
brewing
product
i
like
it
and
im
not
ashamed
to
admit
it
no
need
to
put
this
one
in
a
paper
bag
for
this
style
its
very
inoffensive
and
very
drinkable
a
kinder
gentler
malt
liquor
it
has
a
smoothness
to
it
and
the
taste
is
more
than
tolerable
a
bit
too
sweet
not
as
aggressive
as
the
stinging
bee
on
the
label
would
have
it
but
very
drinkable
and
inoffensive
for
the
style
d
an
average
malt
liquor
but
too
pricey
for
the
style
i
got
bored
with
this
beer
far
to
easily
at
least
it
doesnt
become
undrinkable
due
to
an
alcohol
character
like
some
others
of
this
style
are
d
drinks
good
enough
to
get
me
trashed
very
quickly
overall
a
blast
from
the
past
that
has
some
special
place
in
my
heart
but
not
special
enough
to
relive
those
days
i
have
moved
on
to
bigger
and
better
beers
but
i
wont
soon
forget
those
old
times
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
but
harsh
in
texture
its
a
brainless
and
guilty
pleasure
wow
i
cant
beleive
this
was
my
drink
of
choice
at
times
back
in
high
school
mostly
due
to
a
lack
of
knowledge
i
suppose
it
is
a
golden
color
and
smells
like
malt
and
alcohol
not
quality
malt
the
taste
is
not
too
bad
but
not
too
good
either
the
body
is
fizzy
to
cover
up
off
flavors
a
bottle
of
this
always
made
for
a
fun
night
and
not
much
else
except
a
bad
morning
the
taste
is
sweet
lightly
corndominated
grain
with
hints
of
apple
cider
sweet
white
wine
there
is
a
definite
pleasant
grain
taste
especially
in
the
long
aftertaste
it
has
no
bitterness
at
all
and
a
very
faint
alcoholic
spiciness
one
of
the
biggest
problems
with
reviewing
mickeys
on
a
fine
beer
forward
website
like
beer
advocate
is
that
to
really
review
a
beer
you
have
to
pour
it
into
a
glass
this
makes
mickeys
loose
a
bit
of
its
ambience
nothings
better
than
drinking
a
ice
cold
mickeys
tall
boy
or
large
mouth
40oz
on
a
hot
day
or
when
you
just
want
to
get
that
trailer
park
feeling
so
with
protest
i
poured
this
tall
boy
into
my
smokestack
goblet
and
it
came
gushing
out
as
a
straw
yellow
with
a
big
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
corn
the
taste
is
a
generic
mild
sweetness
that
sits
easy
on
your
tongue
i
have
always
wished
that
mickeys
would
come
out
with
12oz
cans
or
at
least
4
packs
but
alas
i
dont
think
its
going
to
happen
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
to
the
point
where
it
tickles
your
tongue
i
think
this
is
a
very
drinkable
malt
liquor
unlike
some
of
the
other
major
malt
liquor
brands
mickeys
is
palatable
and
easy
to
drink
they
dont
try
to
push
the
envelope
in
terms
of
alcohol
just
to
get
you
drunk
im
sitting
outside
on
a
nice
day
throwing
some
washers
while
sitting
in
a
chair
watching
my
dogs
and
smoking
a
black
and
mild
this
friend
is
beer
nirvana
short
sweet
d
the
only
redeeming
quality
of
this
stuff
is
that
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
it
and
a
lot
of
it
quickly
this
is
a
great
get
drunk
and
be
stupid
beer
d
decent
for
an
oldschool
macro
to
be
honest
i
kind
of
like
the
crappy
malt
liquors
many
come
in
large
sizes
40oz
and
i
can
sit
and
enjoy
a
movie
or
other
entertainment
and
unwind
with
them
on
the
cheap
overall
ive
had
other
mls
that
arent
as
pleasant
to
drink
as
this
one
not
too
bad
d
it
is
what
it
is
an
easy
drunkin
brew
without
a
lot
of
flavour
but
not
really
offensive
either
that
being
said
either
i
got
a
special
fresh
batch
or
mickeys
has
actually
gotten
better
over
the
years
i
remember
it
being
far
more
foul
many
many
many
years
ago
d
you
could
definitely
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
for
the
price
however
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
would
be
making
reservations
for
a
pretty
good
headache
the
next
day
overall
there
are
worse
malt
liquors
out
there
so
mickeys
gets
my
vote
if
you
are
in
the
mood
for
some
malt
taste
is
not
great
but
not
offending
this
is
a
light
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
beer
drinkability
better
than
olde
english
or
a
lot
of
other
malt
liquors
the
best
thing
i
could
say
is
that
id
drink
it
over
bud
any
day
but
then
id
drink
most
things
over
bud
any
day
now
even
i
think
im
crazy
for
giving
a
malt
liquor
a
score
over
2
but
theres
two
things
to
consider
here
this
malt
liquor
compared
to
its
peers
has
less
abv
meaning
that
there
is
more
water
and
less
of
a
pungent
taste
i
dont
really
have
to
describe
anything
here
but
it
breaks
down
like
this
light
gold
color
that
you
can
see
thru
the
smell
is
not
like
paint
thinner
like
an
old
e
or
a
hurricane
yech
but
of
a
watery
hopsubstance
and
the
taste
is
somewhat
foul
but
smooth
the
other
advantage
that
mickeys
has
over
the
other
malt
liquors
and
i
am
not
talking
about
the
goofy
sayings
on
the
cap
is
the
grenade
bottle
for
those
who
dont
know
rather
than
the
normal
bottle
which
on
a
guess
is
6
inches
from
bottom
to
start
of
neck
and
holds
about
2
oz
each
this
bat
boy
is
3
inches
tall
and
theres
4
oz
per
inch
oh
and
the
other
reason
it
is
called
the
grenade
is
because
its
green
the
bottle
not
the
beer
you
end
up
drinking
one
in
about
2
minutes
and
then
after
about
four
or
five
a
strong
buzz
creeps
over
not
my
cup
of
tea
but
i
know
people
enjoy
this
stuff
just
finishing
college
and
having
a
lot
of
experince
of
horrible
beer
and
esp
malt
beer
this
is
prob
my
favorite
still
it
ranks
low
compared
of
the
full
flavors
that
are
out
there
if
one
has
to
drink
a
malt
beer
then
this
is
the
beer
you
should
have
its
one
of
my
favs
plus
in
the
cool
glass
bottles
opinion
this
beer
isnt
too
bad
for
the
category
it
is
in
the
flavor
is
of
course
adjunct
driven
and
is
lacking
in
body
when
compared
to
some
other
examples
of
malt
liquor
this
beer
is
pretty
good
for
that
reason
only
i
will
score
this
one
a
little
higher
because
i
would
drink
this
malt
liquor
over
just
about
any
others
i
have
tried
it
is
a
rotgut
beer
nonetheless
but
it
is
a
quality
rotgut
not
found
in
many
other
examples
sometimes
you
just
gotta
go
with
a
cheap
beer
this
one
being
some
what
of
a
staple
in
my
leaner
days
they
have
ufc
collector
cans
now
i
see
hmm
ok
i
dont
think
anyone
would
really
keep
a
can
after
having
drank
it
but
who
knows
yellow
fizzy
smells
like
sweet
corn
tastes
like
sweet
corn
but
finishes
surprisingly
clean
i
dont
wanna
let
this
thing
warm
up
much
lest
it
start
getting
rank
overall
not
bad
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
non
offensive
lower
abv
malt
liqour
hey
if
you
wanna
get
drunk
for
3
i
cant
think
of
a
better
way
to
do
it
d
ive
enjoyed
this
beer
by
the
40
oz
or
by
the
big
mouth
6
packs
either
way
it
goes
down
rather
nicely
for
an
american
malt
liquor
bravo
miller
my
dad
weened
me
on
miller
high
life
god
bless
miller
by
the
way
the
chicken
liked
it
it
came
out
pretty
good
saw
this
way
too
many
times
during
my
college
years
overall
this
is
a
malt
liqour
not
high
in
alcohol
for
its
style
and
really
not
that
bad
for
its
style
but
im
not
a
fan
of
its
style
pours
a
crystal
clear
staw
hue
with
a
frothy
soap
bubble
head
two
fingers
high
good
retention
and
a
few
specs
of
lacing
mild
pils
malt
and
corn
aroma
with
a
hint
of
dms
scent
sweet
pils
and
pale
malt
taste
with
some
corny
adjunct
in
the
background
mild
apple
ester
in
the
aftertaste
along
with
some
mellow
graininess
but
the
beer
is
fairy
dry
and
the
mouthfeel
is
mostly
clean
once
these
flavors
fade
mediumlight
in
body
with
high
carbonation
and
somewhat
lighter
than
most
malt
liquors
and
much
smoother
this
was
surprisingly
good
but
probably
only
because
it
fits
somewhere
between
malt
liquor
and
american
macro
taste
lasts
long
and
is
very
drinkable
as
well
it
was
kind
of
what
i
expecteda
watery
tasting
domestic
beer
very
little
carbonation
and
the
taste
gets
worse
as
you
get
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
its
not
horrible
but
theres
nothing
really
good
to
say
about
it
except
the
price
if
your
low
on
cash
i
guess
this
would
be
an
ok
choice
ok
so
i
bought
a
40oz
of
this
as
a
joke
to
bring
to
a
party
after
i
poured
one
for
my
hommies
i
kicked
back
and
went
to
town
it
was
not
a
good
beer
at
all
and
it
had
a
hint
of
corn
and
malt
the
taste
was
very
carbonated
and
obviously
high
in
alcohol
mouthfeel
again
carbonated
and
thin
i
would
never
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
but
it
is
fun
to
show
up
to
a
party
with
it
this
beer
is
just
slightly
better
than
the
average
macro
lager
its
still
pretty
insipid
just
more
malty
not
going
to
revisit
though
ill
keep
the
bottle
d
one
of
the
better
malt
liquor
options
out
there
but
it
is
rather
pricey
at
2
50
a
40oz
bottle
while
other
higher
content
40s
run
almost
a
dollar
or
more
cheaper
if
you
want
the
cadillac
of
gas
station
malt
liquor
look
no
futher
than
mickeys
drinkability
have
you
seen
the
mouth
hole
not
much
to
it
worth
a
try
or
to
remember
days
past
and
get
a
cheap
buzz
but
not
much
else
would
certainly
be
spending
my
hard
earned
coin
on
old
milwaukee
at
roughly
60
the
price
before
i
buy
more
of
this
fitting
it
comes
in
a
small
gernade
sized
bottle
as
i
can
imagine
you
could
get
bombed
drinking
more
than
6
in
a
night
12
oz
big
mouth
bottle
for
mass
consumption
obviously
used
to
love
these
as
a
teenager
these
were
primo
to
me
then
typical
macro
lager
in
appearance
and
other
respects
pale
yellow
but
not
as
pale
as
bud
for
example
some
malt
adjuncts
in
the
nose
a
corny
buttery
sweetness
which
i
used
to
find
appealing
not
much
else
a
little
sweetness
is
present
in
the
initial
taste
creamy
flavors
not
much
in
the
way
of
hops
balanced
by
the
force
carbonation
light
in
body
and
spritzy
although
not
as
light
bodied
as
most
macros
drinkability
is
decent
i
suppose
the
point
of
this
beer
is
to
drink
a
lot
and
get
schlitzfaced
reminiscent
of
a
slightly
bigger
version
of
little
kings
mickeys
was
pale
yellow
straw
color
and
very
clear
it
had
a
white
head
that
managed
to
hang
around
a
little
while
before
disappearing
there
was
not
much
to
taste
or
smell
but
was
there
was
not
bad
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
fairly
light
carbonation
drinkability
was
average
its
beer
that
is
low
on
flavor
but
easy
to
drink
overall
not
too
bad
the
overall
flavor
isnt
bad
but
does
seem
very
raw
the
5
6
gives
it
a
nice
fuller
body
that
is
creamy
not
a
bad
buy
at
4
pints
for
2
50
but
not
one
i
would
buy
often
at
all
d
pretty
damn
good
i
could
session
a
few
of
these
little
green
bastards
no
problem
this
is
definatly
not
my
grandfathers
mickeys
besides
the
strange
new
can
with
the
weird
bee
when
i
think
beer
i
think
bee
the
taste
seems
a
bit
flat
i
poured
this
brew
into
a
standard
pint
glass
and
observed
the
pale
yellow
almost
straw
color
the
smell
was
typical
and
underwhelming
but
really
not
an
important
aspect
of
this
kind
of
beer
the
taste
was
pretty
good
much
better
than
other
malt
liquors
strong
sweet
taste
but
counteracted
by
the
bitter
undercurrent
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
more
like
a
lager
than
i
remembered
but
ended
up
allowing
me
to
enjoy
it
even
more
all
in
all
this
beer
is
meant
for
drinking
with
friends
on
a
nice
summer
evening
while
cooking
up
something
on
the
grill
not
for
sitting
in
a
room
geeking
out
about
easy
to
drink
easy
to
enjoy
but
not
for
too
steep
of
a
critique
drinkability
one
could
drink
many
of
these
if
he
did
not
desire
flavor
and
complexity
i
found
it
rather
tasteless
and
boring
but
i
guess
its
a
fine
malt
beverage
in
someones
eyes
d
easy
to
pound
these
little
buggers
nice
opening
for
mass
consumption
inoffensive
taste
a
decent
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
low
abv
for
a
40oz
type
brew
drinking
this
stuff
is
pretty
easy
nothing
youll
wanna
puke
on
simple
because
its
a
fine
malt
liquor
and
i
recommend
it
too
any
beer
drinker
it
seem
the
bottle
has
changed
also
i
remember
a
bigger
mouth
overall
not
something
id
ever
buy
myself
but
whatever
for
a
malt
liquor
its
decent
and
drinking
one
youd
never
know
the
abv
was
over
5
im
not
much
into
malt
liquor
but
this
isnt
half
bad
mickeys
hand
grenades
appears
pale
golden
yellow
tone
with
a
large
bright
white
quickly
dwindling
head
leaves
even
fine
lacing
around
my
glass
aromatics
have
cereal
tones
with
corn
and
rice
pulling
up
a
chair
and
mild
herbal
grass
notes
as
well
flavors
collide
upfront
with
cooked
veggies
herbal
notes
mild
sweetness
and
a
somewhat
metallic
note
though
it
finishes
relatively
clean
after
all
of
that
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
pretty
thin
with
unnatural
carbonation
that
tickles
the
throat
drinkability
is
one
of
those
ghetto
college
staples
that
will
always
sell
with
or
without
a
marketing
campaign
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
this
is
quite
decent
for
a
malt
liquor
its
decent
tasting
and
goes
down
well
dont
be
surprised
if
you
feel
lightheaded
or
get
rowdy
a
good
choice
for
a
malt
liquor
and
at
5
6
abv
its
easy
to
have
more
than
one
now
a
couple
of
decades
later
i
can
say
that
mickeys
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
malt
liquor
not
my
first
beverage
of
choice
but
worth
picking
up
to
share
with
the
uninitiated
drinkability
all
depends
i
will
probably
not
buy
this
again
for
myself
but
i
will
drink
all
6
without
a
problem
keeping
expectations
realistic
this
is
a
really
cheap
malt
liquor
designed
to
be
more
of
an
alcohol
delilvery
system
than
an
attempt
at
a
worthy
malt
liquor
i
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
a
night
just
so
you
can
have
something
else
if
you
decide
to
have
another
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
wioth
modest
initial
white
puffy
head
that
was
rapidly
gone
smell
is
minimal
with
only
a
slight
sweetness
to
be
found
taste
is
sweet
and
crisp
and
is
ok
when
very
cold
but
slowly
degrades
as
the
beer
warms
finish
is
really
a
quick
vanishing
of
any
taste
got
to
dink
it
quick
while
still
cold
get
my
buzz
on
n
mickeys
can
also
be
mixed
with
your
best
orange
juice
and
served
as
a
substitute
to
mamosas
its
called
a
brass
monkey
and
will
be
sure
to
wake
you
up
poured
a
very
yellow
color
with
a
thin
retaining
head
immediatly
smelled
and
tasted
corn
adjuncts
tasted
pretty
sweet
and
malty
not
too
bad
for
1
50
a
40
definetly
the
better
of
the
malt
liqours
but
if
you
were
looking
for
a
premium
brew
this
isnt
it
its
just
cheap
beer
by
no
means
is
this
a
great
beer
not
really
a
good
beer
but
every
now
and
again
this
one
will
hit
the
spot
if
youre
really
looking
to
swank
it
up
with
some
of
your
oldtime
buddies
mickeys
the
choice
before
going
to
concerts
a
40
of
this
will
get
you
ripped
and
roaring
which
is
the
point
to
malt
liquor
the
review
im
doing
is
off
a
hand
grenade
though
they
really
thought
out
their
ingenuity
by
the
way
a
grenade
as
a
bottle
the
little
riddles
that
get
funny
when
youre
drunk
etc
you
dont
pour
this
into
a
glass
ever
from
inside
the
head
sticks
around
quite
well
in
a
40
not
so
much
the
grenades
the
smell
is
whoa
of
grain
and
alcohol
but
not
as
offensive
like
some
other
malt
liquors
probably
because
it
has
less
alcohol
anyways
the
taste
again
all
grain
had
a
corona
halfway
into
a
40
one
time
and
made
the
corona
taste
worse
than
it
usually
would
sooo
it
is
feasibly
better
than
some
beers
out
there
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
not
watery
and
not
heavy
a
lil
too
much
carbonation
but
not
sodalike
the
drinkability
is
actually
quite
good
for
a
malt
liquor
this
stuff
will
always
remind
me
of
high
school
now
in
spite
of
all
this
it
is
drinkable
and
not
bad
for
malt
liquor
not
a
bad
malt
liquor
give
this
one
a
try
if
looking
for
a
budget
beer
mickeys
malt
liquor
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
green
twelve
ounce
grenade
shaped
big
mouth
bottle
smells
like
corn
and
some
alcohol
tastes
like
corn
and
a
little
bit
of
hops
much
more
drinkable
than
many
other
malt
liquors
you
could
do
worse
drinkability
due
to
its
ease
of
drinking
its
definitley
drinkable
may
get
old
after
3
or
4
but
nonetheless
a
decent
malt
liquor
goes
down
very
smoothly
quite
drinkable
loses
some
drinkability
points
for
the
price
not
much
higher
than
hurricane
or
magnum
but
when
im
buying
40s
every
penny
counts
and
for
the
lowish
abv
the
other
reason
i
drink
malt
liquor
still
if
you
ice
this
it
goes
down
fast
in
a
contest
i
watched
two
guys
drink
three
40s
of
this
in
under
7
minutes
and
they
kept
it
down
fine
recommended
and
just
as
good
or
better
than
bad
macro
lagers
milwaukees
best
etc
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentyfour
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
overall
its
not
as
big
sweet
fruity
and
rough
as
many
others
however
its
only
5
6
by
volume
which
is
only
6
higher
than
bud
in
fact
its
barely
a
malt
liquor
but
its
clean
wellbalanced
given
the
style
and
fairly
nice
to
look
at
despite
the
lack
of
head
this
pours
out
like
a
typical
malt
liquor
but
less
viscous
than
some
of
the
high
gravity
ones
has
more
color
than
the
typical
macro
lager
has
a
bit
of
a
rough
grainy
smell
which
doesnt
surprise
me
but
the
flavors
are
very
clean
for
a
malt
liquor
i
find
the
lingering
cornygrainy
flavors
are
there
but
like
i
said
it
isnt
as
bad
as
with
others
all
around
this
is
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
around
this
is
a
halfdecent
malt
liquor
mickeys
is
definitely
a
step
above
the
average
malt
liquor
in
that
i
am
able
to
tolerate
a
few
consecutive
sips
there
is
a
very
slight
adjuncty
hop
bitterness
to
go
along
with
the
disgusting
adjunct
flavor
on
the
whole
this
beer
isnt
preferable
but
it
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
12
oz
green
grenade
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
served
chilled
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
pours
a
yellowgold
color
with
a
few
big
streams
of
carbonation
and
a
halfinch
white
head
that
takes
a
minute
or
two
to
recede
and
does
so
unevenly
as
i
drink
it
leaves
a
surprising
amount
of
weblike
lacing
that
definitely
raises
the
appearance
score
it
smells
rather
clean
with
some
grains
and
corn
and
tastes
about
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
it
has
a
light
and
tingly
body
with
a
short
finish
but
it
is
quite
drinkable
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
and
better
than
most
macro
lagers
especially
for
the
price
big
mouth
bottles
are
a
selling
point
the
brew
is
not
drinkability
i
certainly
dont
regret
buying
24
ounces
of
this
stuff
it
was
a
buckfifty
after
all
but
that
should
be
just
about
enough
for
me
thru
highschool
and
beyond
this
was
the
40
of
choice
for
us
hooligans
on
the
eastside
of
cincinnatibut
even
as
times
change
this
is
still
the
best
tasteing
malt
liquor
around
it
has
a
nice
golden
pour
a
bit
skunky
in
the
scent
but
for
the
price
and
outcomecheap
thrills
what
can
you
expect
discovered
this
beer
in
college
the
liquor
store
had
a
neverending
special
on
six
packs
didnt
mind
it
at
first
although
i
didnt
care
for
the
sweet
flavor
and
aftertaste
we
drank
so
much
of
this
stuff
because
it
was
cheap
you
see
that
more
than
twelve
years
have
gone
by
and
i
still
get
nauseous
when
i
see
it
at
the
store
nasty
stuff
probably
the
best
cheap
brew
ive
ever
had
so
far
it
comes
in
a
neat
barrel
like
green
bottle
it
pours
an
impressive
slightly
darker
gold
with
a
big
frothy
head
that
disappears
quickly
and
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
my
special
beer
glass
the
smell
is
average
macro
lagerish
the
taste
is
pretty
good
it
has
a
very
strong
taste
of
cereal
malts
and
little
bit
of
adjunct
sweetness
but
not
gross
sweet
like
camo
camo
god
help
us
all
anyway
not
very
much
hops
but
enough
to
keep
that
sweet
taste
from
getting
out
of
control
it
is
isnt
watery
and
considering
the
bite
the
taste
carries
it
is
fairly
drinkable
extremely
clean
and
has
no
aftertaste
i
may
have
a
new
cheap
beer
mickeys
in
the
famous
green
grenade
bottle
this
isnt
a
quality
beer
by
any
means
nor
is
it
to
be
treated
as
such
this
is
strictly
a
session
beer
one
to
drink
before
a
football
game
or
at
a
frat
party
its
actually
a
pretty
good
beer
as
far
as
session
beers
go
id
rather
have
a
mickeys
than
a
beast
milwaukees
best
though
i
cant
give
this
beer
a
good
score
it
sucks
compared
to
any
decent
beer
it
is
good
for
what
it
is
intended
for
itll
get
you
drunk
and
wont
make
you
gag
while
doing
it
12
oz
short
fat
bottle
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
the
smell
is
clean
and
malty
the
taste
too
is
malty
but
overall
it
has
this
nasty
sweet
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
sorta
sticky
and
watery
it
is
fairly
drinkable
for
a
few
at
least
the
taste
after
that
sorta
grinds
at
my
patience
an
american
malt
liquor
only
good
for
drink
with
buddies
the
mexican
are
not
goods
for
drink
malt
liquor
but
is
good
for
try
with
american
food
its
penetrate
hops
and
malt
aroma
and
its
generous
grade
of
alcohol
made
perfect
for
drink
slow
in
a
glass
mug
i
not
recommended
this
beer
not
exactly
recommended
but
at
the
same
time
recommended
if
you
are
cheap
3
99
6pack
of
short
wide
grenadelike
green
bottles
with
a
wide
opening
and
a
large
gold
twist
cap
this
is
actually
a
favorite
malt
liquor
of
mine
maybe
it
is
a
combination
of
the
cool
packaging
probably
the
coolest
label
and
cap
combo
on
the
planet
and
the
psuedopalatable
beer
within
the
green
glass
40
bottles
bright
clear
gold
color
head
retention
is
pretty
good
taste
is
somewhat
unpleasent
but
is
drinkable
compared
with
other
malt
liquors
decent
hop
finish
for
a
malt
liquor
one
of
my
favorites
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
if
that
is
your
thing
mickeys
is
a
classic
i
love
this
stuff
gets
you
feeling
right
doesnt
break
the
bank
doing
so
smooth
as
silk
cheap
as
dirt
its
no
westy
12
but
for
a
buck
twenty
it
cant
be
beat
the
boys
at
miller
may
not
always
come
up
with
winners
but
they
sure
as
shit
did
here
goes
down
decently
but
not
super
drinkable
at
all
long
night
of
drinking
last
night
so
i
need
something
to
help
ease
me
in
coming
down
this
is
the
only
thing
available
looks
yellow
and
fizzy
with
a
decent
head
this
really
shouldnt
be
poured
into
the
glass
its
a
drink
from
the
bottle
type
beer
smell
is
all
corn
and
piss
taste
brings
me
more
corn
and
piss
and
maybe
some
alcohol
though
its
not
as
boozy
as
some
other
malt
liquors
ive
had
this
reminds
me
of
miller
high
life
but
in
a
bad
way
very
rough
dont
even
think
about
drinking
this
warm
theres
better
malt
liquors
out
there
reflection
when
i
first
tried
mickeys
it
was
still
in
the
12oz
grenade
shaped
wide
mouthed
bottles
with
pop
tops
even
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
thought
bud
and
coors
were
awful
so
my
beer
of
choice
was
mickeys
im
giving
this
beer
props
thanks
to
mickeys
ive
always
gone
against
the
grain
and
ive
never
been
afraid
to
try
something
different
in
the
beer
world
its
a
flavored
malt
beverage
without
the
flavor
and
its
almost
a
beverage
i
think
im
going
to
find
some
benedryl
and
take
a
nap
ive
been
stung
by
six
little
mickeys
if
im
lucky
ill
dream
of
newport
storms
maybe
mickeys
is
better
from
a
big
mouth
bottle
or
a
chalis
maybe
it
was
better
before
miller
began
brewing
it
who
knows
who
cares
dont
expect
much
and
i
promise
you
thats
exactly
what
youll
get
respect
beer
beeatch
this
stuff
brings
me
back
like
all
the
way
to
thanksgiving
last
year
i
think
this
is
some
of
the
best
malt
liquir
on
the
market
it
tastes
a
little
sweet
and
unlike
some
others
it
dosenot
taste
like
flavored
beer
and
its
way
cheaper
than
smirnof
ice
its
under
9
for
a
12
pack
of
those
really
cool
midget
green
bottles
with
the
recloseable
top
okay
its
been
about
12
minutes
since
i
wrote
this
review
and
after
having
two
of
these
god
da
things
all
i
can
say
is
that
this
shts
for
grown
folks
taste
like
shy
beer
smells
the
same
but
gets
you
trashed
quick
fast
and
in
a
hurry
mickeys
is
a
little
better
than
the
few
other
malt
liquors
ive
had
but
that
isnt
saying
too
much
i
guess
if
your
goal
is
to
get
hammered
mickeys
wouldnt
be
a
bad
choice
craft
beer
lovers
will
want
to
pass
this
up
not
only
did
i
pour
a
little
out
for
my
homie
i
poured
some
out
to
take
a
look
at
it
in
a
glass
which
ive
never
done
before
good
one
finger
head
with
an
aggressive
pour
it
looks
highly
carbonated
and
golden
yellow
and
im
surprised
to
see
some
hints
of
lace
sticking
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
little
sweet
with
a
hint
of
granny
smith
the
taste
is
sweet
with
a
faint
alcohol
taste
and
more
full
than
i
remembered
or
expected
its
much
better
out
of
the
40oz
bottle
than
a
glass
nostalgia
may
be
playing
a
role
in
my
review
but
i
doubt
it
very
drinkable
and
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
after
so
many
years
lets
face
the
facts
people
drink
malt
liquor
to
get
fed
up
more
quickly
they
dont
drink
it
for
the
taste
so
i
ask
this
question
why
drink
mickeys
when
it
tastes
the
same
as
all
other
malts
and
is
lower
in
alcohol
volume
by
3
the
apperance
is
very
straw
yellow
with
no
head
and
no
lacing
the
smell
is
of
funky
meat
and
grain
taste
is
heavy
on
the
grain
weak
on
malts
and
hops
tastes
a
little
metallic
as
well
feels
flat
and
dull
in
the
mouth
drinkable
if
you
are
so
messed
up
you
accidentally
purchase
this
listen
drink
2
bombers
of
arrogant
bastard
instead
better
tasting
by
far
and
more
alcohol
volume
sinkability

this
bomber
bombed
another
variation
from
the
house
of
high
life
beer
factory
in
milwaukee
it
is
as
drinkable
as
any
other
macrobrew
poured
from
a
24
ounce
can
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
respectable
sandy
beach
white
head
rushing
carbonation
noticeable
a
horrible
odor
that
is
skunky
musty
and
rustic
sticky
and
watery
up
front
has
the
maltymaltliquor
thing
going
on
actually
some
hop
detection
is
noticeable
in
this
bland
beverage
but
dont
go
calling
the
hops
authorities
yet
mickeys
also
has
the
classic
malt
alcohol
feeling
no
not
a
belly
warmer
very
carbonated
and
watery
a
terrible
cooked
veggiemalt
liquor
palate
old
school
a
classic
of
its
own
and
one
i
use
to
imbibe
on
a
regular
basis
but
ive
proudly
moved
onward
and
upward
take
care
ol
friend
this
is
just
an
easy
to
drink
malt
liquor
thats
all
there
is
to
it
its
smooth
and
creamy
there
is
the
taste
of
hops
with
a
dash
of
malts
but
its
the
hops
that
run
this
brew
overall
though
it
is
balanced
out
fairly
well
as
far
as
smell
goes
its
a
little
skunky
i
guess
cause
of
the
green
bottles
the
head
is
snow
white
and
sits
around
for
a
couple
minutes
then
dies
out
to
a
laceing
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
its
something
i
would
get
if
i
am
in
dire
need
of
something
to
drink
hey
its
better
than
bud
coors
natty
and
lite
f
a
wide
40
oz
but
not
a
wide
mouth
oh
well
clear
pale
gold
fugitive
head
of
adjunct
character
and
little
duration
aroma
is
fairly
foul
very
vegetal
almost
cauliflower
with
a
pumice
soap
quality
flavor
is
sweetish
but
some
apple
skin
qualities
slightly
redeem
it
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
but
it
helps
make
up
for
missing
hops
and
helps
dry
the
finish
it
felt
a
little
stupid
pouring
this
into
a
shake
for
evaluation
so
it
was
good
to
pound
the
rest
out
of
the
bottle
it
reduces
off
aromas
and
brings
back
the
memories
one
high
school
party
in
particular
drinkability
an
old
college
beverage
that
called
to
me
today
and
i
shouldnt
have
answered
the
best
feature
of
this
beer
is
the
widemouth
bottle
if
i
had
to
choose
a
cheep
malt
liquer
to
drink
this
would
definantly
be
it
i
was
in
need
of
some
beer
and
i
was
way
short
on
cash
so
i
bought
a
mickeys
40oz
for
the
first
time
in
a
few
years
and
let
me
tell
you
it
totally
works
in
a
pinch
the
smell
is
your
typical
grain
sweetness
that
you
will
find
in
other
malt
liquors
but
the
taste
is
supprisingly
smoothe
and
it
goes
down
very
well
not
the
most
complex
flavors
but
at
5
6
a
40
will
do
just
fine
of
corse
it
does
not
hold
a
candle
to
the
likes
of
arrogant
bastard
or
dead
guy
ale
but
when
you
are
in
a
pinch
it
works
perhaps
nostalgia
is
at
play
when
on
several
elk
hunts
this
was
the
beer
we
brought
along
it
goes
down
real
smooth
at
8000
ft
its
drinkable
very
cold
only
unredeemable
even
for
malt
liquor
another
weak
pee
like
yellow
highly
carbonated
brew
this
one
has
a
head
of
fine
white
bubbles
and
just
a
little
lacing
with
carbonated
bubbles
rising
up
the
side
of
the
glass
i
can
spell
burp
already
it
smells
like
puck
spelling
highly
carbonated
taste
but
not
as
bad
as
it
smells
burp
bubly
flavor
with
a
mild
aftertatse
burp
its
a
typical
malt
liquor
with
nothing
special
about
it
burp
burp
burp
just
the
odd
bigmouth
bottles
put
you
into
a
humorous
mood
the
pale
gold
color
with
the
little
fizzy
bubbles
traveling
though
the
body
up
to
the
thin
head
is
misleading
this
beer
has
more
substance
than
you
might
expect
theres
a
round
and
smooth
sweet
malt
foundation
in
which
some
metallic
hop
and
alcohol
reside
alongside
some
cornmeallike
flavor
in
large
gulps
which
the
brewer
intended
with
the
wide
mouth
bottle
an
astringent
medicinal
taste
is
noticed
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
wet
rye
bread
all
in
all
in
the
cheap
malt
liquor
for
the
huddled
massestype
beer
category
not
bad
not
good
either
brain
grenades
that
sums
it
up
these
short
fat
green
bottles
pack
a
helluva
punch
strong
flavor
of
alcohol
and
a
bit
lower
than
normal
carbonation
two
or
three
of
these
will
leave
you
with
a
killer
headache
hence
the
nickname
brain
grenades
for
a
malt
its
not
to
bad
but
id
rather
have
a
colt
45
any
day
itd
been
a
lot
of
years
and
frankly
itll
be
many
more
before
i
try
it
again
not
my
cuppa
but
seriously
folks
nice
light
golden
hue
taste
is
actually
pretty
well
balanced
i
enjoyed
the
memories
thanks
mickeys
i
am
in
college
and
i
have
had
a
lot
of
crappy
beers
in
my
day
but
this
one
has
got
to
be
the
worst
i
have
ever
had
i
bought
a
bottle
and
opened
it
that
very
same
night
and
it
still
tasted
skunked
i
actually
threw
it
away
after
two
sips
if
you
are
looking
to
get
a
40
oz
with
a
lot
of
alcohol
look
elsewhere
because
this
will
be
tough
to
choke
down
6
years
later
friends
of
mine
came
to
a
barbq
with
this
stuff
and
when
kevin
popped
the
screw
cap
i
winced
i
have
no
desire
to
either
sample
this
again
or
relive
my
boozy
campus
years
i
need
to
thank
my
girlfriends
dad
for
saving
me
one
to
review
no
trailer
park
jokes
please
mickeys
isnt
that
bad
the
problem
is
it
isnt
that
good
either
i
must
admit
i
am
a
fan
of
the
wide
mouth
bottles
slightly
sweet
light
aroma
and
grainy
but
drinkable
smooth
medium
straw
in
color
with
minimal
head
and
no
lace
light
smell
of
hops
malt
and
some
cooked
corn
smooth
on
the
palate
with
more
malt
than
hops
what
hops
does
show
slowly
fades
slight
seltzer
like
fizziness
with
smooth
drinkability
and
clean
finish
good
for
quick
buzz
i
can
drink
this
mickeys
fine
malt
liquor
from
time
to
time
just
not
day
in
and
day
out
the
alcohol
is
lower
than
others
but
it
tastes
like
a
beer
and
not
a
mass
of
alcohol
thrown
in
with
terrible
malts
i
cant
go
wrong
with
a
mickeys
big
mouth
pretty
tame
for
a
malt
liquor
most
ice
beers
have
higher
abvs
than
mickeys
that
all
said
one
can
really
tell
miller
must
use
extra
corn
for
the
heart
of
this
brew
pretty
much
smells
and
tastes
like
megaadjuncts
which
isnt
pleasant
but
an
underlying
smoothness
and
decent
mouthfeel
save
this
beer
from
being
on
my
all
time
worst
beer
list
if
you
can
get
by
the
smell
and
get
straight
to
the
bee
stinging
your
brain
then
youve
made
it
to
where
you
want
to
go
ethanol
in
a
green
bottle
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
tasted
i
think
they
created
the
wide
mouth
so
you
could
chug
it
down
like
a
shot
and
get
it
over
with
as
quickly
as
possible
the
color
of
the
beer
was
like
a
faded
yellow
color
and
had
absolutely
no
head
the
aroma
just
reeked
of
corn
or
whatever
odor
creates
that
effect
the
flavor
was
just
hard
to
get
a
hold
of
because
the
finish
is
just
so
harsh
with
a
lot
of
bit
to
make
it
impossible
to
really
discern
any
my
roommates
exchange
for
drinking
my
sierra
nevada
pale
hardly
a
fair
trade
every
malt
liquor
i
have
ever
had
tastes
terrible
however
mickeys
tastes
more
like
a
light
beer
and
goes
down
like
soda
my
first
experience
with
mickeys
was
the
stumpy
wide
mouth
bottles
and
they
seem
easy
to
chug
i
think
thats
the
whole
point
anyway
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
this
is
probably
the
best
tasting
but
it
also
has
the
lowest
alcohol
content
of
a
malt
that
i
have
seen
notes
not
much
to
the
brew
for
flavour
quick
and
clean
to
drink
big
time
college
crowd
40oz
brew
a
step
above
magnum
the
other
miller
brewing
produced
malt
liquor
not
a
bad
web
site
they
put
out
also

httpwww
mickeys
com
a
malt
liquor
that
wears
its
corn
afterburner
proudly
smells
like
cheap
beer
and
doesnt
disappoint
cornyalcoholic
flavor
usually
skunked
meaning
that
a
hop
has
actually
seen
this
brew
the
bottles
are
a
novelty
but
why
would
you
want
easy
access
to
a
brew
like
this
update
i
revised
the
ratings
this
stuff
is
not
bad
it
aint
an
award
winner
but
it
is
not
repulsive
id
spend
my
money
on
this
before
i
would
overpriced
heineken
it
wont
impress
anyone
but
it
tastes
ok
and
gets
teh
job
done
time
to
party
o
not
entirely
offensive
its
pretty
tolerable
up
front
but
the
finish
is
about
as
harsh
as
any
other
icehouse
beer
this
beer
is
only
worth
drinking
if
you
are
trying
to
get
drunk
it
tastes
as
sweet
as
you
would
expect
from
an
8
malt
liquor
that
costs
under
a
dollar
for
a
tall
boy
really
atrocious
that
being
said
if
you
are
going
to
buy
something
like
this
it
is
better
than
steel
reserve
or
hurricanes
if
you
have
a
choice
2
for
3
00
between
this
and
steel
reserve
211
triple
export
youre
better
off
going
with
this
and
thats
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
pours
a
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
cap
layer
some
very
light
spotty
lacing
was
seen
but
not
a
lot
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
sweet
corn
and
alcohol
for
the
most
part
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
sweet
corn
right
up
front
with
lots
of
alcohol
taste
hard
to
drink
actually
have
to
drink
this
one
very
cold
and
probably
fast
but
it
still
isnt
good
guess
if
you
want
a
fast
cheap
buzz
then
this
is
your
brew
not
a
fan
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
had
to
pour
about
half
of
my
half
out
after
several
sips
very
sweet
not
too
sweet
lots
of
corn
have
to
drink
this
extremely
cold
feel
the
alcohol
kick
in
within
minutes
a
good
malt
liquor
or
strong
beer
miller
is
not
ashamed
of
its
line
of
malt
beverages
like
steel
or
olde
english
800
love
their
oe
high
gravity
at
8
0
alc
vol
its
got
the
strength
of
a
malt
liquor
but
not
the
body
or
the
depth
of
malt
flavor
normally
associated
with
the
style
aaahhh
and
it
just
occurred
to
me
perhaps
thats
why
its
named
edge
or
perhaps
it
gives
you
an
edge
because
if
you
drink
this
quickly
the
alcohol
will
certainly
hit
you
just
as
fast
at
least
for
the
pint
can
and
youll
end
up
with
a
little
dutch
courage
overall
given
the
intentions
behind
it
its
not
bad
but
on
a
worldwide
scale
of
beer
with
a
3
being
about
average
it
just
doesnt
meet
that
mark
its
good
for
what
it
is
cheap
drinkable
beer
thatll
give
you
a
quick
buzz
out
of
all
the
cheap
ass
hobo
beer
this
is
one
the
easiest
to
gag
down
overall
you
ever
play
truth
or
dare
and
take
the
dare
and
regret
it
thats
this
beer
and
now
im
1
29
poorer
to
show
for
it
o
much
worse
than
i
expected
and
my
expectations
were
pretty
low
much
too
hot
and
much
too
boozy
i
didnt
realize
i
was
grabbing
a
malt
but
that
is
what
i
got
very
cheap
but
it
tastes
like
cheap
tangy
dry
beer
if
you
have
an
acquired
taste
for
malts
this
is
probably
pretty
good
if
not
its
not
a
good
beer
to
drink
and
enjoy
a
movie
if
you
just
want
to
get
drunk
pinch
your
nose
and
guzzle
it
not
for
me
lets
face
it
no
one
is
drinking
this
for
the
flavor
or
to
savor
the
aromas
for
an
8
malt
liquor
there
is
no
real
perception
of
alcohol
as
long
as
its
cold
really
cold
if
youre
looking
for
something
like
this
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
seriously
if
you
dont
like
it
youre
out
like
what
a
buck
and
some
change
wow
this
stuff
is
really
nasty
only
got
it
cause
its
the
only
malt
liquor
available
at
the
store
that
knows
me
and
i
lost
my
id
thankfully
that
is
not
a
problem
anymore
i
got
it
now
but
when
i
came
to
a
realization
that
i
had
peed
in
a
beer
can
as
well
as
had
a
few
with
left
over
beer
in
it
and
i
could
not
tell
by
smell
or
taste
which
one
was
the
beer
i
then
realized
this
is
some
nasty
shiz
its
like
they
bottled
urine
and
i
am
never
drinking
it
again
i
even
like
211
better
than
this
slop
its
an
8abv
icehouse
no
one
buys
these
for
their
delectable
taste
that
being
said
its
one
of
the
best
cheap
beers
with
high
abv
better
than
steel
reserve
and
better
than
eq
pours
with
a
more
impressive
head
than
i
would
have
thought
but
after
90
seconds
or
so
its
gone
quickly
receding
lace
smells
sour
like
sour
apple
and
corn
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
its
okay
honestly
o
curiosity
got
the
best
of
me
when
i
bought
this
its
not
good
but
it
is
a
decent
malt
liquor
no
terrible
boozy
chemical
or
fusel
flavors
puts
this
above
many
of
its
competitors
for
what
thats
worth
to
me
for
a
higher
abv
icehouse
this
is
a
pretty
good
bang
for
your
buck
i
purchased
a
24
ounce
can
for
1
10
after
tax
it
pours
your
typical
american
adjunct
lager
color
yellow
fizzy
water
id
say
the
smell
is
of
musky
corn
the
taste
is
actually
nothing
but
a
regular
icehouse
with
a
little
more
punch
but
the
alcohol
is
not
noticable
so
overall
i
say
it
is
a
okay
beer
i
cant
complain
ive
had
worse
i
give
it
a
thumbs
up
price
is
icing
on
the
cake
icehouse
edge
brewed
by
miller
co
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
now
this
brew
is
8
0
abv
the
smell
is
sweet
like
male
liquor
the
tease
is
sweet
as
well
it
reminds
me
of
a
malt
liquor
even
though
its
a
lager
im
impressed
on
how
smooth
this
brew
goes
down
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
i
would
get
it
again
over
all
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
5
me
and
2
friends
went
on
a
beer
run
one
of
them
points
out
these
24oz
cans
that
are
1
75
ea
and
says
there
like
a
step
below
natural
ice
which
is
what
we
get
when
we
want
a
cheap
buzz
so
at
8
alcohol
i
got
us
2
a
piece
back
at
the
pad
we
pour
it
into
mugs
and
its
a
dark
yellow
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
looks
good
so
i
smell
it
and
yuck
its
a
putrid
rotten
dirty
dish
water
chemical
kind
of
smell
thats
when
i
hesitated
but
took
a
sip
i
for
sure
was
not
impressed
one
bit
you
can
taste
massive
amounts
of
corn
and
there
is
that
dirty
dish
water
and
chemical
taste
kinda
sweet
you
can
taste
the
alcohol
but
they
do
pretty
good
at
covering
it
up
bubbly
mouthfeel
which
i
dont
complain
about
with
good
tasting
beers
but
the
texture
makes
it
just
more
worse
gave
me
the
shits
after
drinking
2
and
a
head
ache
the
next
day
which
never
happens
i
never
get
hang
overs
and
i
drank
plenty
of
water
with
it
it
got
me
pretty
tipsy
thats
about
all
its
good
for
its
worth
a
purchase
frankly
i
think
its
the
best
high
gravity
next
to
shlitz
vsl
drinking
this
will
get
you
drunk
but
not
a
good
drunk
it
makes
your
head
hurt
and
makes
you
want
to
get
some
sleep
meh
its
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
drank
but
not
the
worst
it
kinda
burns
going
down
it
has
a
strong
taste
that
i
cant
really
get
myself
to
enjoy
i
drank
the
whole
can
because
i
hate
wasting
things
but
this
isnt
something
ill
purchase
again
ive
never
tried
regular
icehouse
and
after
this
i
dont
know
if
i
want
to
i
gave
it
a
3
on
the
mouth
feel
because
i
oddly
enjoy
the
creamy
fizziness
can
stuck
out
to
me
so
i
grabbed
it
taste
is
ok
real
drinkable
not
much
of
a
flavor
profile
its
just
one
of
those
beers
you
get
if
your
looking
for
a
cheap
buzz
feels
so
weird
in
the
mouth
like
a
mouth
of
fizzy
whipped
cream
hehe
bought
this
on
a
whim
at
a
gas
station
on
the
way
home
from
work
ive
had
keystone
before
back
during
my
younger
days
and
before
the
craft
beer
renaissance
that
is
currently
taking
place
here
in
alabama
there
is
no
way
a
person
could
enjoy
this
beer
unless
they
were
hoping
to
get
drunk
as
quickly
as
possible
the
taste
is
fizzy
corn
and
nothing
else
save
yourself
from
pissing
later
youre
already
holding
in
your
hand
bad
brew
overall
dont
kid
yourself
this
is
pretty
lowquality
stuff
but
for
a
can
of
highgrav
malt
liquor
theres
worse
stuff
out
there
note
of
warning
dont
let
it
warm
up
as
macro
lagers
go
regular
icehouse
is
just
fine
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
from
the
pack
in
any
notable
way
icehouse
edge
on
the
other
hand
is
horrible
i
cant
take
enough
sips
of
this
to
think
about
what
exactly
im
tasting
beyond
something
like
windex
while
there
is
some
kind
of
sweet
flavor
happening
in
here
the
main
and
distracting
thing
is
some
kind
of
chemical
cleanser
taste
it
is
straight
up
bad
i
can
drink
just
about
anything
in
the
standard
gas
station
line
up
i
almost
never
do
but
once
in
a
great
while
i
will
have
some
high
school
nostalgia
and
go
get
some
cheap
snacks
and
some
tall
boy
cheapo
macro
lagers
but
this
is
something
else
altogether
it
is
a
horrid
product
i
got
such
a
great
deal
on
it
and
now
i
guess
i
understand
why
i
poured
out
all
but
a
few
sips
of
it
it
may
be
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
im
not
a
beer
snob
and
i
enjoy
the
merits
of
a
cheap
beer
from
time
to
time
but
this
is
absolute
garbage
i
had
one
can
and
immediately
felt
hungover
which
makes
me
seriously
question
its
ingredients
i
did
have
it
cold
which
should
help
but
any
crispness
was
overtaken
by
a
skunky
sweet
taste
i
will
likely
never
buy
this
again
as
there
are
definitely
better
malt
liquors
out
there
that
are
generally
pretty
easy
to
get
though
i
wish
they
cost
as
little
as
this
one
cost
me
in
the
poorest
sketchiest
part
of
pensacola
florida
1
5924
oz
why
is
it
that
nothing
costs
that
little
in
austin
except
maybe
keystone
or
busch
but
id
pay
an
extra
40
cents
for
an
oe
or
a
natty
daddy
anyway
its
worth
it
theyre
noticeably
better
good
flavour
and
more
of
it
this
is
relatively
tasteless
except
for
a
hint
of
metal
and
yeast
great
for
a
bum
not
so
great
for
me
im
glad
i
got
a
chance
to
give
it
a
try
though
thanks

good

really
reminds
me
of
st
ides
without
the
harsh
ending
got
a
couple
of
these
to
start
the
weekend
out
before
switching
to
higher
end
beer
does
the
trick
its
got
a
punch
to
it
and
no
lingering
assault
on
the
taste
buds
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
malt
liquor
this
is
one
to
buy
not
good
but
does
a
good
job
of
masking
its
strength
so
its
accomplishing
what
it
sets
out
to
a
tasteless
high
alcohol
swill
for
those
just
looking
for
a
cheap
buzz
o
if
i
need
a
cheap
beer
i
always
look
to
malt
liquors
they
also
have
higher
abv
so
i
pick
these
up
after
work
to
relieve
the
stress
of
another
day
of
hell
very
malty
corny
alcohol
sweet
swill
this
has
one
good
use
getting
wasted
simple
and
plain
not
a
brew
you
wanna
sip
or
let
warm
up
for
its
style
they
do
a
decent
job
but
as
far
as
quality
it
should
be
illegal
but
i
must
say
these
will
get
you
drunk
if
your
looking
for
a
cheap
strong
buzz
just
grab
a
few
of
these
o
overall
this
is
once
again
just
another
cheap
beer
i
doubt
id
have
again
tastes
just
like
an
adjunct
with
some
vodka
splashed
into
it
even
ice
cold
this
is
a
gnarly
brew
avoid
it

for

two
fingers
of

and
had
such
retention

to
slow
me
down
color
was
a
pretty
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
not
just
sweet
but
ridden
with
corn
i
have
mentioned
silage
before
in
reviews
and
here
was
yet
another
unpleasant
example
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
like
nail
polish
remover
it
had
a
cloying
sweetness
which
coupled
with
its
high
gravity
abv
made
it
a
roaring
hangover
candidate
finish
was
likewise
cloying
sweet
and
nothing
that
would
bear
repeating
overall
while
the
aroma
and
initial
tastes
were
quite
nice
for
a
malt
the
finish
to
the
taste
was
rather
offensive
not
the
best
malt
out
there
finally
found
this
stuff
at
a
gas
station
whilst
fillin
er
up
it
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
corn
funky
wheat
powdered
sugar
and
a
faint
hint
of
booze
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strong
vein
of
perfumey
vinyl
nice
real
nice
thanks
for
that
one
there
guy
a
bunch
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
a
pretty
sad
little
beer
i
honestly
didnt
expect
too
much
from
it
but
its
bad
regardless
pours
a
deep
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
off
white
head
that
quickly
shrunk
the
smell
is
of
sweet
and
sour
grains
not
much
else
besides
its
slightly
metallic
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
lots
of
sweet
grain
and
some
metal
no
hops
detectable
the
beer
is
thick
with
low
carbonation
and
a
kind
of
syrupy
feel
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
the
other
8
cheap
beers
but
its
still
not
that
great
dont
want
to
bash
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
some
green
apples
taste
is
not
so
good
alcohol
is
present
plastics
corn
and
grains
damn
these
24
oz
cans
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
i
got
what
i
paid
for
a
cheap
buzz
grains
are
noted
in
the
taste
up
front
with
a
slight
lingering
alcohol
bite
moving
in
at
the
end
for
the
malt
liquor
style
this
is
fairly
typical
although
that
pear
thing
was
a
slight
bonus
certainly
no
worse
than
bud
light
or
coors
light
with
a
much
bigger
kick
goldenbrown
beer
with
a
thick
foamy
head
sweet
fruity
aroma
with
dry
grain
and
corn
notes
and
alcohol
esthers
tastes
of
sugary
vegetables
and
not
much
else
the
initial
few
sips
bordered
on
repulsive
but
it
somehow
gets
better
if
you
keep
drinking
maybe
my
taste
buds
have
gone
into
a
coma
lacks
the
offensive
musty
metallic
taste
of
some
malt
liquors
but
other
than
that
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
itll
get
you
drunk
and
isnt
that
what
malt
liquor
is
for
rjt
if
i
consider
the
style
this
was
average
it
was
grainy
sweet
and
warm
as
expected
it
was
high
abv
and
sorta
drinkable
from
the
can
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
it
is
a
very
cheap
buzz
i
drank
icehouse
in
college
and
actually
enjoyed
it
and
still
get
it
every
once
in
a
great
while
when
i
feel
like
slumming
it
but
i
cant
ever
see
trying
this
again
i
have
no
better
words
its
just
yucky
malty
adjunct
lager
with
strong
grainy
taste

its
all
the

perhaps
the
light

drinkers
who
are
just
not
used
to
a
somewhat
full

really
does

just
drink
it
because
it
taste
awesome
to
meand
judging
from
a
lot
of
the
reviews
here
i
am
not
alone
in
my
love
of
this
tasty
beverageits
just
too
bad
that
so
many
people
do
not
give
malt
liquors
in
general
a
chanceand
think
all
of
it
is
just
cheap
crap
that
taste
like
shitthe
real
truth
is
that
a
lot
of
malt
liquors
are
very
good

you
happen

strong
beer
that
actually

a
real

i
became
introduced
to
schlitz
malt
liquor
35
years
ago
as
a
teen
it
was
the
drink
of
my
older
brother
after
trying
different
beers
over
the
years
i
found
myself
returning
and
sticking
to
the
bull
the
taste
is
smooth
and
original
i
find
it
like
an
energy
drink
i
drink
it
during
my
softball
tournaments
and
stay
energized
it
doesnt
leave
the
aftertaste
as
other
high
priced
beers
does
it
is
not
considered
as
a
quick
drunk
beer
to
me
and
my
sports
friends
it
is
the
beer
of
choice
and
trust
me
we
can
afford
any
beer
out
there
but
we
prefer
our
bull
the
taste
has
a
light
grainy
sweetness
to
it
actually
balanced
with
a
wisp
of
pineygrassy
hop
bitterness
and
flavour
this
is
a
little
less
graintasting
sweet
and
fullbodied
than
some
like
overall
its
a
cheap
buzz
the
best
commercial
malt
liquor
available
its
cheap
it
doesnt
taste
like
shitmiller
lite
its
nearly
6
when
you
cant
afford
a
damn
stout
or
ipa
or
tripel
wtf
ever
man
drink
some
fuckin
malt
licka
for
a
cheap
buzz
hoggie
i
love
you
overall
i
got
the
last
12
pack
in
my
local
ingles
and
it
isnt
restocking
and
sadly
ive
never
seen
it
anywhere
else
in
person
this
is
a
great
gotodaily
beer
but
i
have
a
feeling
i
may
not
see
it
again
for
a
long
time
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
nor
is
it
the
case
that
the
beer
is
lacking
in
aroma
flavor
or
body
overall
it
fits
the
malt
character
rather
well
while
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
and
even
with
some
light
off
flavors
it
is
quite
cheap
paid
2
29
for
a
40
and
still
very
drinkable
not
too
bad
bottom
line
dont
let
the
label
and
aggressive
ghetto
targeted
marketing
fool
you
this
is
a
good
beer
especially
for
the
price
this
is
going
to
sound
like
sacrilege
here
but
this
is
a
good
beer
if
this
were
available
where
i
actually
live
itd
be
a
regular
when
i
wasnt
holding
craft
money
lawnmower
steez
for
places
where
lawns
dont
grow
that
well
i
had
5
thats
all
my
wife
left
me
when
she
went
to
work
lol
so
i
saw
the
18
oz
bottles
of
this
for
0
99
at
the
local
beverage
barn
so
i
bought
four
of
them
i
got
them
all
nice
and
cold
and
sat
down
to
watch
my
rangers
piss
away
the
al
west
to
the
oakland
as
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
it
was
very
good
it
went
down
very
smoothly
and
tasted
pretty
damn
good
i
like
it
better
than
any
other
schlitz
beer
but
i
wished
i
had
more
to
drown
my
sorrows
of
the
rangers
choking
away
the
division
i
will
buy
this
beer
again
if
you
hate
malt
liquor
then
dont
go
there
golden
brownish
beer
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissolves
slowly
smells
of
sweet
corn
and
musty
grain
taste
is
super
sweet
like
sugar
water
with
some
hints
of
adjuncts
none
of
the
musty
metallic
flavor
you
get
with
some
malt
liquors
seriously
though
is
this
blended
with
corn
syrup
its
more
like
a
sweet
tea
than
beer
served
ice
cold
in
a
frosted
glass
mug
pours
the
color
of
straw
with
a
thick
two
finger
length
white
head
some
nice
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
plenty
of
tiny
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
beer
smells
like
grains
i
can
detect
the
corn
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
nice
mild
grainy
sweetness
to
this
beer
the
malt
and
corn
come
through
with
some
mild
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
end
the
alcohol
isnt
that
detectable
in
the
taste
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
plentiful
carbonation
this
beer
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
very
good
good
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
price
i
picked
up
an
18
ounce
bottle
for
99
cents
at
a
gas
station
so
if
youre
looking
for
a
malt
liquor
this
one
is
worth
a
try
this
is
pretty
foul
it
has
a
warm
metallic
grainy
taste
thats
incredibly
displeasing
i
admit
that
i
bought
this
more
for
a
cheap
buzz
than
anything
else
but
ill
steer
clear
in
the
future
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
bubbly
head
scent
is
that
of
cheap
grassy
grains
drinks
fine
with
a
sweet
grainy
taste
but
the
after
taste
goes
south
leaving
a
chalky
dry
finish
thin
in
texture
and
drinks
as
fast
as
water
not
something
i
would
buy
again
but
at
least
it
was
an
average
quality
malt
liquor
that
was
better
than
others
i
have
had
lil
sweet
with
an
alcoholic
finish
not
much
else
mouthfeel
is
kinda
light
and
watery
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
overall
probably
the
best
malt
liqour
ive
had
and
ive
had
most
of
them
very
drinkable
had
this
in
a
can
well
its
what
was
available
aroma
is
weak
wan
and
malty
it
pours
a
very
uninspiring
clear
pale
yellow
at
least
the
white
head
is
fairly
thick
flavor
is
malty
and
a
little
fruity
actually
better
than
i
expected
but
still
not
much
then
again
i
have
been
spoiled
rotten
by
craft
brews
texture
is
smooth
but
hardly
fizzy
at
all
ive
drunk
soymilk
that
left
more
of
a
tingle
i
guess
you
have
to
drink
swill
occasionally
so
you
can
better
appreciate
the
real
stuff
tastes
like
summer
in
college
playing
beer
pong
overly
sweet
taste
that
hides
everything
but
the
inevitable
drunkenness
at
the
end
of
the
can
not
too
much
to
say
this
is
pretty
typical
of
malt
liquors
i
cant
think
of
many
redeeming
things
to
say
about
this
one
aroma
is
faint
taste
is
not
that
great
feel
is
kind
of
watery
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
malt
liquor
which
is
to
say
stay
the
hell
away
this
beer
was
the
epitome
of
average
its
got
the
classic
cheap
beer
taste
and
not
much
else
this
is
what
your
alcoholic
uncles
breath
smells
like
im
a
fan
of
that
bad
beer
flavour
but
its
not
usually
what
i
expect
from
a
malt
liquor
i
usually
expect
more
corn
in
a
malt
liquor
and
maybe
a
bit
of
an
alcohol
taste
maybe
some
unbalanced
sweetness
not
here
this
was
super
duper
average
one
good
thing
was
the
presence
of
hops
for
balance
thats
odd
but
kinda
fun
in
a
beer
that
often
goes
hopless
its
also
nice
to
have
that
bad
beer
taste
exacerbated
more
than
most
cheap
beers
tend
to
do
as
opposed
to
malt
liquors
i
might
go
for
this
again
if
its
plain
o
beer
i
want
but
never
again
if
im
craving
a
malt
liquor
cuz
thats
just
not
what
this
tastes
like
well
you
know
the
drill
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
and
gold
color
aroma
is
veggie
corny
and
sweet
flavor
is
sweet
grainy
with
no
hop
character
to
speak
of
mouth
feel
is
rough
overly
carbonated
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
an
alcohol
delivery
device
that
is
barely
enjoyable
foamy
head
that
dissipates
relatively
quickly
into
a
lining
around
the
top
medium
amber
gold
body
smells
like
bubble
gum
and
corn
tastes
like
corn
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
light
syrupy
mouthfeel
easy
to
drink
but
the
high
abv
content
will
get
you
buzzed
fast
d
pretty
middle
of
the
road
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
once
is
probably
enough
for
this
one
d
5
9
is
pretty
low
for
a
malt
liquor
this
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
itd
be
at
least
pretty
good
sippin
from
the
bottle
crouchin
on
the
corner
shootin
dice
with
ashy
larry
tyrone
biggums
this
is
not
cocaine
in
a
can
and
no
you
can
not
taste
my
penis
now
get
over
here
ronda
poured
out
of
the
can
no
real
head
no
real
smell
dark
gold
color
this
one
goes
down
smooth
with
little
taste
and
no
aftertaste
very
unlike
ice
beers
with
the
same
alcohol
content
as
ice
beers
tend
to
have
an
unpleasant
alcohol
smell
and
leave
an
aftertaste
would
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
dont
know
what
these
other
folks
are
talking
about
but
this
beer
is
awesome
its
on
the
cheaper
end
of
the
price
scale
but
dont
let
it
fool
you
its
smooth
balanced
but
on
the
malty
side
great
smooth
silky
texture
and
mouth
feel
this
has
become
my
standard
go
to
i
want
a
beer
beer
highly
recommended
but
dont
confuse
it
with
the
other
varieties
of
schlitz
look
for
the
blue
bull
d
dont
want
more
but
it
will
get
ya
drunk
if
thats
what
you
want
dictated
not
read
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
corny
mild
aroma
malty
fizzy
taste
watery
mouthfeel
everything
you
love
in
a
malt
liquor
the
point
was
more
alcohol
and
little
beer
taste
we
used
to
buy
kegs
of
this
stuff
for
parties
in
the
summer
and
it
was
a
huge
hit
the
18
to
25
year
old
crowd
loved
this
stuff
as
a
craft
beer
drinker
i
would
have
rate
this
a
slightly
better
than
average
as
a
malt
liquor
and
fairly
much
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
when
it
comes
to
adjunct
american
macros
the
modern
version
is
best
avoided
altogether
unless
pounding
beers
is
your
game
drinkable
well
it
wont
kill
you
immediately
you
could
do
better
it
came
in
dead
last
during
the
tasting
being
what
it
is
a
cheap
malt
liquor
it
has
a
decent
flavor
not
bad
at
all
really
but
not
great
either
just
ok
to
me
it
pours
a
pale
straw
color
and
has
a
very
strong
smell
of
corn
adjunct
most
likely
to
boost
alcohol
content
nothing
overly
offensive
though
not
an
unpleasant
drinking
experience
and
if
i
found
myself
really
thirsty
and
hot
and
sweaty
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
again
all
in
all
its
ok
its
a
cheap
malt
liquor
with
an
ok
taste
nothing
really
stands
out
as
far
as
taste
goes
though
if
you
want
a
decent
malt
liquor
then
this
may
be
your
beer
drinkability
was
good
not
amazing
as
it
has
been
built
up
to
be
im
on
the
fence
id
honestly
rather
have
a
mickeys
or
king
cobra
id
buy
again
if
i
needed
a
change
of
pace
d
easy
not
bad
not
great
but
is
within
the
style
poured
from
a
brown
40
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
malty
not
very
flavorful
but
actually
quite
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
probably
more
so
than
any
other
malt
liquor
i
have
had
overall
not
a
bad
example
of
this
beer
style
notes
while
i
have
yet
to
find
a
malt
liquor
that
is
super
delicious
i
would
consider
this
one
on
the
bottom
half
of
the
ones
ive
had
the
flavors
are
just
too
much
id
rather
it
taste
like
less
because
then
it
wouldnt
be
so
grossly
sweet
this
bull
is
pretty
sweet
almost
sugary
graininess
with
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
alcohol
and
a
dollop
of
what
i
am
assuming
is
hops
make
for
a
drying
and
mildly
bitter
finish
abv
is
pretty
restrained
but
still
noticeable
carbonation
is
about
medium
or
slightly
low
for
a
malt
liquor
pretty
slick
and
it
slides
down
the
throat
with
ease
would
rather
have
one
of
these
than
say
a
bud
light
rjt
poured
into
an
8
ounce
tasting
glass
five
times
smells
fairly
clean
grainy
mildly
cornlike
high
amounts
of
carbonation
but
with
a
slick
kinda
sugary
feeling
on
the
tongue
not
hot
or
harsh
like
a
lot
of
malt
liquors
better
than
i
remembered
it
i
got
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
gradually
settled
into
wisps
color
was
a
pretty
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
really
sweet
almost
unnaturally
so
definitely
fusel
like
walking
into
a
dry
cleaners
oof
it
had
a
medium
mouthfeel
which
was
nice
but
the
taste
was
a
combination
of
perfume
bubble
gum
and
cereal
and
to
think
that
i
was
once
intimidated
by
this
stuff
now
it
just
seemed
cheap
and
not
well
made
at
all
the
finish
was
dry
but
it
left
a
lingering
taste
of
cereal
in
my
mouth
my
can
held
24
ounces
and
that
was
plenty
believe
me
i
cannot
get
my
mind
around
a
40
of
this
dreck
this
one
tops
my
list
of
malt
liqours
for
now
til
i
find
a
better
one
but
this
is
still
a
good
goto
for
your
malty
needs
wish
we
got
a
clear
picture
of
the
can
before
it
was
crushed
lol
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bad
beer
shared
a
pint
with
thepeskydingo
thank
heavens
i
didnt
have
to
drink
this
animal
myself
warning
stay
away
from
das
bull
another
cold
wet
alcohol
brew
with
little
character
if
your
into
malt
liquor
than
you
must
try
this
cheers
got
this
in
a
quart
from
the
lcbo
drank
straigt
from
the
bottle
nice
golden
yellow
color
and
after
every
swig
nice
head
is
left
over
smells
more
like
a
beer
than
a
malt
but
odd
at
the
same
time
taste
is
good
on
this
one
i
docked
it
5
because
it
gets
rather
flat
after
about
1015
swigs
otherwise
tastes
like
macro
booze
is
hidden
goes
down
smooth
i
like
it
mouthfeel
is
full
and
smooth
drinkability
is
perfect
when
ice
cold
its
really
easy
to
pound
em
back
has
more
taste
than
a
macro
but
its
low
in
abv
so
thats
kind
of
a
turn
off
but
otherwise
rock
solid
malt
d
another
malt
liquor
really
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
strikingly
unoffensive
but
also
lacking
the
punch
it
needs
by
the
way
i
passed
a
urine
test
by
using
schlitz
as
my
piss
the
taste
has
a
light
grainy
sweetness
to
it
actually
balanced
with
a
wisp
of
pineygrassy
hop
bitterness
and
flavour
this
is
a
little
less
graintasting
sweet
and
fullbodied
than
some
like
mickeys
or
colt
45
but
has
a
slightly
stronger
hop
chracter
and
bitterness
making
it
more
wellrounded
this
is
a
poor
example
of
a
malt
liquor
its
too
sweet
and
vegetal
like
most
malt
liquors
schlitz
is
something
i
hope
to
never
drink
again
the
yellow
color
and
poor
head
make
me
think
it
should
be
enjoyed
from
the
can
wait
did
i
just
say
enjoy
there
was
nothing
enjoyable
about
the
taste
or
smell
both
were
of
corny
grains
and
cheap
alcohol
the
body
was
light
and
a
little
syrupy
at
just
under
six
percent
this
isnt
even
good
for
getting
drunk
still
its
mostly
carbonated
water
could
be
the
worst
brew
my
young
beer
intellect
has
had
yet
worse
i
dont
find
schlitz
to
be
as
bad
as
it
is
made
out
to
be
but
this
was
bad
even
the
bottle
is
ghetto
it
is
just
a
silver
label
with
the
blue
bull
and
it
says
schlitz
malt
liquor
can
you
make
something
generic
if
it
is
already
generic
the
brew
itself
is
a
cheap
alcoholic
speedball
it
has
no
redeeming
qualities
as
the
taste
is
very
weak
and
bitter
but
the
mouthfeel
is
one
of
smoothness
because
it
goes
right
down
the
pike
this
is
designed
for
someone
to
slam
a
couple
on
the
cheap
and
get
their
buzz
not
bad
at
all
for
a
style
thats
often
slamed
this
beer
was
present
on
my
parents
first
date
so
i
just
may
owe
my
very
exsistence
to
this
beer
a
big
imposing
blue
bull
against
a
white
brick
wall
on
the
can
i
guess
that
says
it
all
about
what
im
getting
myself
into
with
this
one
im
hoping
not
to
get
gored
well
see
even
though
the
proper
way
to
drink
a
malt
liqour
is
out
of
the
canbottle
i
poured
a
small
bit
into
a
glass
to
judge
the
appearance
pale
yellow
fizzy
with
a
head
that
goes
to
nothing
almost
immediately
smells
a
harsh
goes
with
the
taste
sweetness
and
alcohol
a
small
bit
appley
this
one
is
hard
to
get
down
given
how
low
in
alcohol
it
is
well
i
avoided
the
horns
but
cant
say
ill
mix
it
up
with
the
blue
bull
again
d
a
pretty
good
malt
liquor
easy
to
drink
a
fair
beer
to
beer
to
buy
if
you
are
on
a
budget
this
has
been
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
malt
liquor
in
quite
some
time
as
in
years
im
actually
surprised
by
it
a
little
the
appearance
of
this
brew
looks
similar
to
any
mass
produced
american
beer
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
head
it
smells
only
a
little
bit
more
malty
than
other
mass
produced
beers
im
even
surprised
by
the
taste
its
really
not
that
bad
no
wonder
bums
drink
this
stuff
i
mean
i
dont
like
ipas
and
most
of
them
cost
two
to
three
times
as
much
as
this
stuff
theres
not
much
carbonation
in
each
sip
and
it
does
go
down
pretty
smoothly
all
in
all
this
stuff
is
very
drinkable
for
what
it
is
its
cheap
smooth
not
bad
tasting
and
very
cheap
olde
english
still
beats
this
in
my
book
for
cheap
malt
alright
this
isnt
exactly
the
height
of
craft
brewing
but
ya
know
i
kinda
like
it
its
smooth
refreshing
and
actually
doesnt
taste
bad
at
all
unlike
a
lot
of
macros
it
avoids
the
bitterwithnoflavour
problem
by
not
being
bitter
so
i
guess
you
can
say
its
balanced
its
a
bit
boozy
which
i
attribute
to
high
alcohol
to
taste
ratio
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
i
look
forward
to
sampling
other
malt
liquors
but
i
wish
they
came
in
smaller
sizes
just
a
buffed
up
american
beer
i
wonder
how
this
fits
into
the
category
of
malt
liquor
when
it
does
not
even
taste
like
malt
liquor
this
malt
is
in
the
middle
of
the
road
for
me
i
dont
love
it
but
i
dont
hate
it
either
goes
down
easy
but
has
a
very
unremarkable
taste
not
that
the
taste
is
bad
but
its
just
not
there
i
bought
a
40
of
this
stuff
and
poured
it
into
a
drinking
glass
the
appearance
was
not
too
bad
its
an
electric
crystalclear
golden
with
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
decent
bubbly
offwhite
head
the
head
didnt
dissapear
entirely
the
smell
is
faint
of
cereal
like
corn
maybe
the
taste
is
pretty
sweet
also
reminding
me
of
corn
and
leaves
a
syrupy
bland
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
smooth
with
a
right
amount
of
carbonation
overall
i
think
40
ounces
is
too
much
to
drink
of
this
stuff
but
if
youre
on
a
tight
budget
itll
keep
you
company
well
overall
for
1
59
for
32
oz
this
one
will
give
any
macro
swill
a
run
for
its
money
not
recommended
but
certainly
worthwhile
for
getting
messed
up
on
a
budget
not
nearly
as
rough
as
your
average
malt
liquor
it
actually
tastes
like
a
maltier
budweiser
not
horrible
but
not
great
schlitz
is
good
for
what
it
is
these
are
quite
drinkable
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
the
price
factor
is
also
nice
for
times
when
youre
on
a
budget
schlitz
malt
liquor
pours
a
pale
fizzy
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
brown
thirty
two
ounce
bottle
smells
like
adjunct
but
not
unpleasantly
so
crisp
some
metallic
flavors
are
present
pretty
drinkable
by
malt
liquor
standards
if
you
are
looking
for
malt
liquor
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
yeah
this
shits
ok
the
blue
and
the
red
bull
schlitz
varieties
are
more
similar
in
the
can
than
in
the
big
bottle
the
carbonation
sort
of
ruins
the
mouthfeel
from
the
can
and
hides
the
taste
some
might
appreciate
this
but
i
spent
1
25
on
this
can
and
i
wanna
taste
my
maltadjuncts
fuck
yall
schlitz
i
mean
pabst
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
initially
head
is
large
white
and
puffy
but
rapidly
fell
to
a
thin
coating
smell
is
minimal
with
a
slight
sweet
note
taste
is
also
very
mild
and
when
the
beer
is
very
cold
it
is
ok
as
it
warms
it
becomes
less
acceptable
finish
is
refreshing
ok
but
not
much
else
okay
this
is
not
that
special
of
a
beer
but
it
is
exactly
what
it
is
crisp
and
clean
and
so
easy
to
drink
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
nothing
bad
anyway
it
pours
out
a
light
straw
color
very
clear
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
clings
to
the
glass
a
bit
yeah
i
poured
part
of
theis
tall
boy
into
a
glass
so
i
could
see
what
it
looks
like
anyway
it
smells
pretty
decent
has
a
little
bit
of
a
hop
character
this
is
completely
lacking
in
the
taste
which
is
very
water
like
i
dont
give
it
any
gross
points
so
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
as
far
as
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
is
light
and
as
easy
to
drink
as
water
if
only
the
alcoholish
flavors
stayed
hidden
as
it
warmed
up
a
lightly
amber
beer
good
for
refreshing
and
summer
days
little
strong
generous
abv
ominpresent
in
its
flavor
much
hops
and
malt
smell
like
crispy
bread
notes
of
malt
flower
taste
lightly
bitter
grassy
and
sweet
try
in
a
mug
glass
with
snacks
pasta
is
good
too

shkwokk
the
door
opens
accompanied
by
the
sound
of
her
whip
id
seen
her
before
but
never
dared
test
my
skills
now
she
stands
before
me
tall
lean
and
cool
light
golden
tan
skin
and
nearly
bleached
white
on
top
firm
and
sticky
like
from
too
much
hair
gel
im
a
bit
worried
and
i
lean
backward
as
i
search
for
an
escape
seeing
my
weakness
she
approaches
and
stands
nose
to
nose
my
goodness
i
catch
a
hint
of
sweet
perfume
on
this
temptress
ruffian
wet
sweet
over
a
flowery
hint
not
at
all
what
i
expected
in
the
moment
i
struggle
with
this
surprise
she
attacks
on
her
lips
i
taste
memories
of
honey
from
her
morning
toast
lilac
flowers
perhaps
her
heart
is
true
yet
her
bluecollar
nature
shows
through
like
drab
cardboard
stiff
and
drab
to
the
world
yes
shes
no
pussy
cat
she
bites
my
tongue
leaving
a
sting
like
rough
vodka
mixed
with
a
fizzy
warm
uncola
the
encounter
continues
longer
than
id
like
dry
and
thin
on
my
end
until
im
left
repellant
i
hang
in
to
serve
my
duty
until
finally
the
deed
is
done
i
quietly
sidestep
out
of
the
room
and
dazed
i
wonder
if
ill
regret
our
encounter
in
the
morning
1
69
40
oz
i
dont
often
reach
for
an
icecold
malt
liquor
okay
never
but
if
i
was
so
inclined
this
wouldnt
be
a
bad
way
to
go
it
wins
this
head
to
head
between
the
two
grizzled
veterans
of
the
style
and
will
now
be
awarded
the
laurel
wreath
as
the
victor
in
malt
likkapalooza
i
it
also
wins
the
ever
important
best
can
category
thanks
to
the
big
blue
bull
looking
to
kick
a
little
colt
avoid
this
gin
n
juice
in
mizzy
social
settn
ill
slap
tha
taste
out
yo
mouf
if
you
really
wiznant
ta
give
it
a
go
id
recommend
a
trizzay
ta
tha
corna
quikpak
fo
a
tall
boi
or
a
40
doggystyle
put
that
purchase
in
a
hustla
sack
n
driznink
it
stone
cold
n
ftothaizzast
oh
man
i
have
no
idea
why
i
had
this
in
my
fridge
or
decided
to
drink
it
in
the
middle
of
the
day
but
i
did
boredom
this
has
that
malt
liquor
taste
but
isnt
quite
as
alcoholy
or
hot
as
other
malt
liquors
decently
crisp
and
it
has
that
grainy
adjuncty
sweetness
i
would
compare
to
mickeys
as
with
all
malt
liquors
this
beer
sucks
once
its
not
ice
cold
ok
enough
of
this
i
need
an
imp
stout
this
isnt
as
nasty
as
i
remember
from
when
i
had
this
is
high
school
the
appearance
is
yellow
with
a
foamy
head
that
quickly
subsides
aroma
is
that
sweet
malt
liquor
smell
that
all
malt
liquors
seem
to
have
in
common
this
is
fairly
unoffensive
when
compared
to
others
taste
isnt
as
sickly
sweet
as
i
remember
right
now
it
seems
just
like
any
adjunct
lager
just
with
more
alocohol
and
a
little
bit
more
sweetness
im
not
gonna
lie
and
say
this
is
good
however
it
is
slightly
better
than
the
average
malt
liquor
word
well
ive
had
worse
malt
liquors
but
not
much
worse
it
poured
a
piss
yellow
color
with
a
suprisingy
decent
head
that
stayed
around
and
left
a
touch
of
lace
the
smell
was
horrible
with
nothing
but
skunk
and
grain
the
taste
was
just
as
bad
with
a
really
nasty
sweetness
that
made
me
pucker
with
disgust
after
every
sip
this
is
one
i
will
never
be
drinking
again
give
me
a
mickeys
any
day
more
drinkable
than
you
would
think
this
isnt
necessarily
inferior
to
budweiser
but
it
is
just
really
an
alcohol
delivery
device
ill
confess
i
picked
up
a
pint
of
this
on
a
whim
not
often
you
get
a
pint
this
cheap
it
cost
me
just
buck
and
some
pocket
change
pours
fairly
well
and
has
a
rather
nice
color
to
it
doesnt
really
smell
like
much
this
last
bits
the
most
surprising
because
it
tastes
like
a
puddle
of
fratparty
vomit
high
alcohol
low
on
every
other
feature
that
really
makes
beer
enjoyable
as
i
drank
it
i
felt
myself
developing
an
urge
to
watch
football
excessively
and
crush
the
can
on
my
head
id
recommend
buying
a
can
just
to
remind
yourself
why
you
shell
out
the
extra
cash
for
a
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
it
was
fished
from
a
drainage
ditch
standard
macro
fare
with
the
basic
formula
we
expect
this
is
one
of
the
big
3s
more
potent
offerings
appearance
is
very
straightfoward
yellow
with
a
light
white
head
little
retention
and
only
mild
lacing
strong
sense
of
adjuncts
and
very
little
aroma
to
impress
the
drinker
overall
i
wouldnt
say
this
beer
has
no
redeeming
qualities
it
has
a
flavor
it
is
cold
and
fluid
and
has
a
little
more
character
than
some
of
the
more
respected
beers
out
there
another
sound
brown
paper
bag
brew
economically
speaking
straw
like
yellow
with
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
big
bubbly
head
fades
down
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
atop
the
brew
light
sweet
grain
smell
on
the
nose
light
sweetness
on
the
tongue
with
a
bit
of
harsh
bitterness
in
the
middle
hangin
wit
da
hommies
on
dis
brew
this
is
the
nastiest
stuff
ive
ever
had
i
bought
a
40
of
it
and
only
had
3
sips
one
to
taste
it
the
second
to
taste
again
becuase
i
didnt
believe
how
nasty
it
was
and
the
third
just
to
make
sure
the
color
was
nothing
special
just
a
really
pale
yellow
with
no
head
but
some
carbonation
the
smell
was
like
a
skunk
was
in
a
dirty
sock
takin
brown
the
taste
was
just
like
the
smell
unfortunately
needless
to
say
im
never
going
to
buy
another
if
there
were
0
on
here
it
would
get
a
total
score
of
0
definite
i
am
drinking
this
because
of
the
alcohol
beer
it
does
have
the
malt
tast
minus
the
taste
of
hops
this
is
because
the
overwhelming
tastes
of
nail
polish
remover
kills
your
tastebuds
prepare
your
self
for
one
big
head
ache
the
next
day
somewhat
sweet
for
a
malt
with
a
taste
that
mostly
like
stinky
alcohol
kind
of
weak
for
a
dirty
40
at
5
9
but
oh
well
if
it
was
higher
i
would
probably
be
huggin
the
porcelain
throne
the
label
is
cool
i
guess
i
am
drunk
anyway
so
who
cares
glad
this
came
in
a
32oz
dark
brown
glass
bottle
because
i
am
developing
an
aversion
to
beer
in
cans
medium
gold
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
layer
good
lace
herbal
aroma
with
grains
and
alcohol
decent
flavor
begins
with
malt
sweetness
strong
alcohol
finish
is
dry
and
hoppy
should
be
consumed
ice
cold
its
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
but
one
can
do
worse
for
the
money
i
can
think
of
several
nationals
that
are
not
as
good
and
cost
more
than
this
one
it
looks
like
a
plastic
display
once
poured
no
movement
odd
tastes
awfully
metallic
like
youre
sucking
a
battery
smells
kinda
of
toasted
when
you
get
it
in
those
massive
bottles
im
sure
it
does
the
trick
for
a
good
price
highschool
memories
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
this
one
isnt
too
bad
the
usual
adjunct
smell
and
taste
with
a
noticeable
alcohol
bite
a
little
hop
bite
not
much
aftertaste
and
an
unusual
smoothness
makes
this
palateable
be
sure
to
drink
it
ice
cold
and
out
of
the
40
oz
bottle
with
the
brown
paper
bag
to
get
the
full
effect
i
think
i
have
a
new
heavyweight
champion
in
this
category
sucks
i
cant
get
it
local
itd
be
a
regular
easily
this
ice
malt
liquor
is
definitely
a
sipper
it
makes
my
lips
tingle
and
is
hard
on
the
throat
after
every
few
swigs
from
a
frost
glass
i
need
a
sip
of
water
to
continue
sometimes
it
makes
me
gag
and
i
spit
up
a
little
i
prefer
hefenreffer
and
o
e
but
with
the
ass
kicking
8
2
it
does
have
its
place
to
get
wrecked
though
its
very
soothing
and
calming
in
the
end
i
judge
malt
liquors
on
their
taste
and
ability
to
get
me
a
buzz
in
record
time
schlitz
bull
ice
does
it
for
me
like
no
other
the
taste
is
outstanding
and
the
buzz
factor
is
off
the
scale
steel
reserve
and
olde
english
800
are
good
when
there
is
no
bull
ice
available
but
the
bull
tramples
all
i
only
wish
i
had
access
to
bull
ice
8
here
in
virginia
like
i
had
in
oklahoma
no
luck
though
only
5
9
im
a
malt
liquor
fan
and
this
stuff
sucks
i
wanted
to
find
the
o
m
l
but
this
is
all
they
sell
here
i
always
keep
a
few
steel
reserves
in
the
fridge
when
i
want
a
quick
buzz
over
my
usual
pbr
so
i
do
drink
8
0
swill
regularly
this
stuff
is
nasty
it
has
one
hell
of
an
aftertaste
just
gross
pretty
sure
once
i
finish
the
40
ill
have
a
buzz
but
damn
i
should
have
just
got
2
srs
and
been
8
oz
to
the
better
i
love
malt
liquors
and
was
therefore
very
excited
to
get
a
hold
of
this
since
they
dont
have
it
in
texas
at
least
not
that
ive
seen
all
i
can
say
is
what
an
enormous
disappointment
the
taste
was
so
incredibly
stale
it
was
awful
it
sort
of
tasted
like
steel
reserve
triple
export
but
way
less
fresh
it
had
a
nauseating
mild
yeasty
character
that
just
did
not
accompany
stale
malt
at
all
it
was
like
trying
to
drink
the
liquid
form
of
an
old
wheat
roll
thats
been
sitting
around
for
a
very
long
time
and
is
hard
as
a
rock
but
also
has
a
little
bit
of
mold
growing
on
it
somehow
it
was
so
bad
it
turned
my
stomach
so
much
that
i
had
to
pour
a
decent
portion
down
the
drain
the
amount
i
managed
to
get
down
got
me
buzzed
but
at
what
cost
o
overall
its
a
cheap
malt
liquor
that
doesnt
taste
like
absolute
garbage
after
finishing
the
240z
can
i
had
a
happy
buzz
so
in
my
book
thats
a
plus
since
thats
really
the
only
purpose
to
malt
liquor
ill
give
it
a
2
5
for
that
in
this
category
and
remember
some
wise
words
schlitz
gives
you
the
shits
i
said
to
myself
this
is
either
rotgut
or
very
good
not
surprised
to
say
its
more
good
than
bad
one
huge
point
you
beer
snobs
keep
bringing
up
is
its
not
hoppy
look
up
malt
liquor
it
has
no
hops
it
is
kind
of
a
scotch
ale
type
of
taste
and
very
good
for
what
it
is
if
youre
waiting
for
the
rosy
hop
buzz
it
will
never
comei
like
it
toobut
this
was
a
change
and
a
trip
back
to
the
early
70s
when
i
drank
the
bull
all
in
all
a
good
malt
would
i
drink
it
every
day
not
a
chance
but
for
a
change
it
was
very
good
in
a
sammy
glass
one
more
thingim
writing
as
im
drinking
it
and
i
will
finish
the
40oz
i
bought
and
see
about
the
hangover
factor
tomorrow
this
is
somewhere
between
champale
and
the
old
ballatine
triple
and
is
8
2
so
its
like
i
already
said
about
scotch
ale
style
at
this
point
i
would
say
winner
winner
chicken
dinnerbut
i
will
wait
for
the
hangover
mentioned
earlier
taste
is
a
little
less
refined
grainy
and
coarse
light
apple
sweetness
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
perceptible
but
thankfully
not
too
rough
theres
some
fruity
esters
apple
jacks
not
much
astringency
only
slight
fairly
clean
which
goes
along
way
for
malt
liquor
overall
this
is
serviceable
not
overly
sweet
boozy
or
full
of
off
flavors
after
a
little
while
the
alcohol
is
felt
fairly
quickly
for
a
malt
liquor
this
isnt
too
bad
though
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
edit
after
the
lingering
next
day
hangover
definitely
wont
seek
this
out
again
overall
drinkability
pretty
decent
for
its
style
mostly
clean
all
around
so
thats
a
major
plus
for
a
style
where
you
really
dont
want
to
taste
or
feel
the
harsh
brewing
byproduct
pours
a
nice
looking
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
white
head
very
little
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
grainy
ricy
with
some
skunk
notes
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
lots
of
grains
rice
lightmedium
body
what
the
hell
is
going
on
with
these
macro
brews
they
suck
a
waste
of
water
and
money
rjt
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
consistency
than
water
and
once
you
annhilate
your
taste
buds
to
the
alcohol
you
could
get
some
marginal
enjoyment
out
of
the
corn
syrup
sweetness
feel
to
it
other
than
that
this
stuff
fulfills
its
destiny
as
an
awful
beer
beer
is
pretty
bland
with
only
a
mild
sweet
aftertaste
not
a
very
good
one
i
fear
oh
well
ive
had
a
lot
of
these
schlitz
beers
and
the
best
one
ive
had
so
far
is
the
vsl
it
is
actually
a
decent
beers
the
rest
of
these
are
just
awful
its
thin
and
watery
with
very
ltitle
flavor
and
a
harsh
blunt
finish
i
would
drink
this
again
especially
if
i
could
find
it
in
a
40oz
overall
the
clarity
not
natural
and
the
price
point
4
99
for
6
tall
boys
are
the
only
things
that
make
this
even
the
least
bit
acceptable
d
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
but
i
think
i
actually
prefer
the
lighter
feeling
and
tasting
ones
like
king
cobra
because
the
reason
we
drink
these
is
to
get
drunk
and
cobras
just
a
little
easier
to
chug
d
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
still
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
if
i
wanted
to
get
messed
up
tm
the
mouthfeel
has
a
texture
that
is
better
than
water
but
not
what
i
would
classify
as
medium
somewhere
in
between
the
taste
is
retched
although
with
some
hops
in
the
background
it
leaves
a
sour
unappealing
aftertaste
clear
light
copper
with
big
bubbles
racing
to
the
surface
of
a
respectable
rocky
white
foam
head
that
melts
into
soft
peaks
and
leaves
blotchy
lace
behind
sweet
malt
and
grain
alcohol
make
up
the
nose
this
beer
tastes
like
a
malt
liquor
should
if
you
like
the
style
and
i
do
grits
and
sweet
maltiness
with
just
enough
generic
hop
bitterness
to
balance
perfectly
alcohol
warms
the
belly
with
each
sip
medium
bodied
with
mild
carbonation
decent
brew
if
you
like
malt
liquor
not
bad
more
tolerable
than
the
v
s
l
not
bad
for
the
style
not
too
impressive
otherwise
but
you
should
try
it
anyway

had
to
update
score
for
appearance
huge
dense
white
head
lasts
a
good
10
minutes
and
leaves
copious
lacing
mouthfeel
is
who
cares
drinkability
is
no
it
was
40
night
at
my
house
again
cause
them
bitches
can
screw
themselves
and
bitter
beer
goes
well
with
a
bitter
mood
out
of
the
giant
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
dark
gold
color
with
a
skim
of
white
head
the
retention
was
weak
and
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
the
aroma
was
semisweet
and
mildly
sour
like
fermented
apple
cider
mixed
with
corn
mash
the
flavors
were
similar
starting
on
a
more
dull
and
muted
note
it
then
got
sweet
in
a
candylike
dextrose
way
that
was
clearly
being
used
to
cover
up
the
alcohol
still
for
8
2
it
was
rather
easy
to
drink
the
carbonation
was
light
the
body
medium
the
mouthfeel
slick
d
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
ive
run
across
this
might
just
give
steel
reserve
a
run
for
its
money
though
a
bit
of
a
rarity
around
here
schlitz
iml
is
a
worthy
competitor
d
this
is
head
an
shoulders
above
some
other
malt
liquors
and
i
would
take
this
over
it
smells
pretty
gross
though
typical
for
this
kind
of
beverage
i
havnt
even
drank
down
to
the
top
of
the
label
and
im
already
feeling
woozy
drinkability
is
for
those
who
who
want
to
get
really
messed
up
with
not
that
much
money
dont
even
waste
time
on
this
stuff
taste
i
sure
didnt
have
any
when
i
decided
to
pick
this
up
nasty
semi
sweet
flavour
of
rotting
grain
i
kid
you
not
this
absolutely
sucks
and
is
most
assuredly
a
drain
pour
i
really
cant
imagine
a
market
for
it
nuff
said
avoid
di
enjoy
some
40oz
from
time
to
timebut
this
could
scare
me
from
trying
many
moreill
stick
with
oe
800
from
now
on
right
up
there
w
schlitzs
blue
bull
in
terms
of
cheapness
i
use
that
term
in
regards
to
taste
and
impact
on
wallet
but
will
get
you
drunk
quicker
the
smell
had
this
acidic
alkaline
battery
smell
almost
like
this
took
off
some
of
the
metal
from
the
vat
they
make
it
in
or
they
used
paint
thinner
to
clean
them
old
urban
legend
this
is
very
light
and
watery
w
nothing
to
hide
the
hops
that
make
up
the
abv
i
would
avoid
having
more
than
one
40
of
this
then
again
i
would
avoid
this
in
general
at
least
the
label
isnt
completey
generic
like
the
blue
bull
label
from
the
other
schlitz
malt
liquor
this
one
has
a
brick
wall
1
99
for
a
40
oz
bottle
of
8
2
alcohol
beer
what
the
hell
i
brought
it
home
and
filled
my
1
liter
spaten
oktoberfest
mug
with
it
its
a
medium
gold
color
with
a
huge
bubble
bathlike
head
it
smells
pretty
bad
wet
corn
and
malted
hay
and
dirt
some
kind
of
awful
chemical
stink
it
stinks
like
formaldehyde
from
disecting
earthworms
in
middle
school
tastes
like
chewy
sour
bitter
old
sundried
grass
clippings
its
pretty
terrible
getting
drunk
cheaply
is
this
beers
sole
purpose
and
that
purpose
it
serves
well
if
thats
your
goal
d
super
cheap
and
super
high
in
booze
content
without
the
burn
of
ojo
malo
so
it
is
not
that
bad
but
id
prefer
a
mickeys
or
a
fff
overall
this
is
a
really
cheap
beer
i
think
1
95
for
a
40oz
it
also
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
in
it
however
out
of
the
40s
ive
had
this
isnt
all
that
bad
most
of
the
time
when
buyig
a
40
the
intent
is
on
getting
drunk
this
will
atleast
give
you
a
good
start
i
dont
recommend
this
unless
that
is
your
goal
this
is
a
slightly
better
than
average
40
oz
it
looks
slightly
better
smells
slightly
better
tastes
smoother
but
in
the
end
its
still
1
99
malt
liquor
the
taste
is
extremely
cloying
i
do
notice
more
of
a
malt
flavor
than
in
other
40s
definitly
smoother
than
most
others
ive
tried
not
bad
but
definitly
not
something
id
want
around
all
the
time
da
be
good
to
yourself
my
fellow
bas
save
your
tastebuds
the
grief
i
wish
i
had
schlitz
bull
ice
pours
a
light
orange
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
clear
thirty
two
ounce
bottle
smells
like
corn
maybe
a
bit
like
corn
husk
tastes
fairly
bad
even
by
malt
liquor
standards
ive
had
worse
but
this
isnt
good
by
any
stretch
lots
of
alcohol
noticeable
in
the
taste
metallic
aftertaste
im
sure
the
swill
will
be
really
bad
spend
your
pocket
change
elsewhere
appears
a
yellow
golden
hue
with
a
large
white
head
which
quickly
dwindles
revealing
rather
even
lacing
kinda
weird
to
see
that
pour
from
this
24oz
can
of
schlitz
bull
ice
aroma
has
a
very
sweet
tone
wtih
corn
and
rice
noticeable
as
the
sugar
sources
along
with
evident
almost
grain
alcohol
notes
doesnt
hide
the
fact
that
its
8
2
abv
at
all
flavor
comes
off
grainy
with
strong
alcohol
and
corn
and
rice
and
a
hint
of
fruitiness
that
is
a
bearable
other
than
that
i
was
bludgeoned
with
notes
that
i
care
not
redescribe
especially
if
youve
tasted
a
high
gravity
malt
liquor
not
palatable
to
me
lets
move
on
to
the
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
bodied
kinda
coats
the
palate
in
the
worst
way
artificial
carbonation
stays
with
me
way
too
long
drinkability
god
knows
especially
not
on
anyones
deathbed
please
god
not
mine
yes
its
cheap
both
in
price
and
taste
on
rare
occasions
i
want
a
cheap
watery
domestic
so
im
reviewing
them
too
to
see
what
is
my
cheapo
of
choice
it
wont
be
this
one
but
it
wasnt
quite
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
looks
like
a
typical
cheapo
clear
medium
gold
with
a
small
white
foamy
rapidly
diminishing
head
the
trick
is
to
drink
this
stuff
very
cold
when
it
warms
up
the
corn
and
alcohol
really
come
out
in
the
aroma
with
a
vengeance
when
very
cold
it
smells
of
grain
and
some
light
fruit
and
with
some
husky
corn
scents
tastewise
a
near
freezing
temperature
still
cant
cover
up
the
wicked
corn
but
the
alcohol
isnt
so
noticeable
once
it
warms
up
the
alcohol
comes
on
strong
and
burning
feels
rather
thick
in
the
mouth
and
not
in
a
good
way
like
i
said
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
its
still
nothing
id
ever
drink
again
i
tried
this
beer
last
night
just
for
the
hell
of
it
the
grocery
store
in
the
town
i
was
in
didnt
have
much
of
a
selection
so
i
decided
to
go
for
the
cheap
buzz
this
beer
poured
a
darkish
yellow
color
with
no
head
at
all
not
a
good
sign
for
what
was
to
come
the
smell
was
of
corn
and
ethanol
taste
was
barely
tolerable
i
tasted
mainly
adjuncts
and
alcohol
with
some
fruity
alelike
notes
as
the
beer
warmed
up
the
corn
and
rice
flavors
became
more
pronounced
along
with
the
boozy
taste
i
finished
the
24oz
can
and
went
to
bed
maybe
i
should
have
picked
up
that
lone
6pack
of
killians
instead
i
used
to
swill
this
junk
in
college
decided
to
try
a
blast
from
the
past
tonight
and
all
i
can
say
is
thank
god
i
have
a
good
job
and
can
afford
to
drink
craft
beers
job
security
and
benefits
are
nice
but
its
even
nicer
that
i
dont
have
to
drink
this
crap
anymore
poured
into
a
big
24
oz
mug
in
2
waves
of
beer
looked
to
be
a
dark
yellow
color
with
a
good
sized
fluffy
white
head
smell
was
heavy
on
the
skunked
adjuncts
i
wouldve
guessed
that
this
is
a
product
of
iowa
based
on
all
of
the
corn
in
it
taste
was
absolutley
foul
cloyingly
sweet
with
skunk
that
made
me
shudder
after
every
sip
alcohol
was
also
extremely
present
this
is
not
a
good
tasting
substance
but
after
only
one
bottle
i
was
feeling
pretty
warm
on
a
cold
minnesota
night
this
is
a
horrific
beer
from
the
smell
of
rubbing
alcohol
to
the
metallic
graininess
i
could
only
put
down
a
few
swallows
painful
to
drink

the
alcohol
stings
every
time
you
take
a
sip
and
it
covers
up
any
beer
flavour
that
may
be
there
this
beer
gives
40s
a
bad
name
not
drinkable
for
me
im
happy
i
get
paid
on
wednesday
so
i
can
buy
some
at
least
average
beers
to
drink
i
hate
to
think
i
would
have
to
drink
stuff
like
this
all
the
time
wow
not
bad
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
colt
45
but
with
a
far
higher
alcohol
content
and
a
much
more
malty
flavor
another
welcome
suprise
was
the
fact
that
for
being
8
2
alcohol
it
lacks
that
strong
booze
flavor
strong
overtones
of
corn
and
malt
dominate
this
brew
with
an
almost
creamy
mouthfeel
im
not
a
malt
liquor
fan
by
any
means
but
this
stuff
is
really
quite
good
for
those
of
you
who
favor
lagers
and
ales
this
may
be
up
your
alley
worth
a
try
a
clear
yellowgold
body
is
capped
by
a
goodsized
head
of
creamy
white
foam
that
holds
exceptionally
well
and
initially
leaves
some
very
nice
rings
of
lace
about
the
glass
not
that
too
many
fans
of
this
beer
are
drinking
it
from
glasses
it
delivers
some
mildly
sweet
malt
in
the
nose
which
is
nice
a
clear
note
of
alcohol
and
some
lowkey
fruitiness
at
times
it
can
smell
like
a
cheap
white
wine
and
theres
also
a
low
background
vegetal
note
its
not
offensive
however
and
may
actually
lend
some
additional
character
to
the
aroma
in
the
mouth
its
full
and
creamy
with
a
gentle
caress
on
the
tongue
before
sliding
away
as
smooth
as
velvet
its
so
full
in
fact
that
it
sticks
about
the
mouth
and
i
had
to
rinse
my
mouth
out
with
water
throughout
the
tasting
to
try
to
look
for
any
nuances
that
might
be
there
in
the
flavor
the
lightly
sweet
malt
which
is
obviously
adjunctladen
as
theres
little
graininess
to
it
combines
with
the
alcohol
to
balance
it
out
rather
than
bitterness
the
subtle
fruitiness
thats
there
tries
to
compete
with
the
alcohol
but
never
really
comes
through
as
more
than
a
background
note
in
fact
the
alcohol
is
surprisingly
strong
desipte
the
fact
that
its
only
8
2
by
volume
the
initial
fermentation
must
be
quite
warm
for
a
lager
yeast
strain
it
finishes
with
an
initial
note
of
sweet
malt
that
slowly
erodes
amongst
increasing
drying
alcohol
its
certainly
not
the
best
malt
liquor
but
its
not
the
worst
ive
tasted
i
certainly
prefer
this
more
malty
ice
version
to
the
red
bull
this
is
a
rough
malt
liquor
granted
it
will
get
you
good
and
drunk
for
little
cash
but
ill
take
st
ides
high
gravity
over
this
any
day
beside
the
illhidden
alcohol
the
ice
brewing
leaves
its
signature
disgusting
taste
i
dont
expect
much
from
malt
liquors
but
this
still
doesnt
live
up
to
those
low
expectations
very
surprised
when
i
tried
this
very
good
for
a
large
brewery
good
carbonation
and
head
very
smooth
and
with
a
40oz
bottle
you
should
share
or
take
your
time
the
8
2
abv
has
a
kick
and
its
only
1
49
its
a
shame
most
of
the
reviewers
on
this
site
dont
understand
high
gravity
american
malt
liquors
and
therefore
ignorantly
feel
inclined
to
stigmatize
and
trash
them
comparing
them
with
unrelated
trendy
craft
beers
i
ask
the
beer
advocate
community
please
grow
up
this
is
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
on
the
market
and
ive
tried
them
all
it
does
everything
its
supposed
to
and
does
it
exceptionally
well
a
rational
beer
reviewer
would
put
well
made
strong
american
malt
liquors
in
a
similar
category
as
belgium
trippels
or
german
helles
bocks
light
body
light
color
low
ibu
delightfully
strong
and
chuggable
surprisingly
v
s
l
is
smoother
than
many
expensive
belgium
trippels
easier
drinking
than
eisbocks
has
no
off
flavors
not
overly
sweet
or
boozy
and
theres
no
cheap
beer
headache
hours
after
drinking
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
the
taste
clean
in
contrast
to
the
often
overly
sweet
ester
flawed
heavy
bodies
of
many
craft
beer
attempts
at
strong
lagers
or
bocks
if
you
go
in
with
preconceived
notions
this
beer
is
cheap
getto
trash
based
on
the
bandwagon
of
close
minded
novice
snobbery
reviews
reconsider
this
beer
is
an
archetypical
american
classic
it
doesnt
matter
if
its
low
price
industrial
comes
in
a
big
garish
can
or
full
of
corn
adjunct
it
works
the
balance
is
impeccable
ill
take
this
masterpiece
any
time
over
the
endless
boring
heaps
of
overpriced
overrated
craft
hop
bomb
clones
if
only
craft
brewers
would
embrace
this
remarkable
beer
style
and
give
the
hop
bombs
a
rest
already
overall
a
bit
of
a
chore
to
drink
i
poured
it
into
a
nonic
pint
glass
and
i
think
it
tastes
better
out
of
the
can
i
have
to
say
i
like
the
old
schlitz
ml
bull
from
the
1970s
but
all
i
can
find
lately
are
these
hg
malt
liquors
enjoy
by
date
is
jan
5
2015
super
fresh
if
it
is
a
six
month
span
overall
what
you
wood
expect
cheep
booze
in
a
big
can
rjt
it
had
been
awhile
since
i
tried
a
schlitz
bull
it
really
isnt
bad
at
all
and
would
probably
make
a
good
candidate
for
a
tomato
juice
beer
because
its
strong
and
highly
carbonated
i
probably
rated
it
higher
than
i
should
have
but
i
did
this
with
a
certain
thought
process
i
compared
it
to
larine
95
larine
95
while
not
a
great
beer
is
better
tasting
than
this
beer
however
this
beer
is
better
or
more
fairly
priced
alcholol
content
is
comparable
between
the
both
let
me
say
this
about
this
beer
it
is
definitely
not
a
full
body
or
full
flavored
rich
tasting
beer
but
then
again
it
is
a
beer
and
is
not
bad
tasting
either
i
would
drink
it
again
although
probably
it
is
not
in
my
top
80
yes
i
have
had
a
lot
of
experience
although
i
didnt
rate
beers
for
many
decades
try
it
dont
shun
it
but
do
not
expect
a
duvel
or
allagash
but
do
not
expect
a
bad
beer
either
it
is
ok
and
sometimes
ok
is
fine
and
8
5
abv
makes
it
better
and
it
advertises
itself
as
a
very
smooth
lager
which
it
is
24
oz
can
pours
straw
with
tall
foamy
white
head
and
nice
lacing
smells
like
fermented
apple
juice
and
hints
of
grassy
hops
body
is
full
and
smooth
taste
is
alcohol
fermented
juice
and
peppery
hops
finish
is
long
dried
by
alcohol
nice
drain
opener
one
drink
and
done
drain
gets
the
rest
wow
truly
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
not
too
bad
actually
and
the
extra
alcohol
is
covered
up
sweet
mostly
but
not
overpowering
or
cloying
not
the
best
thing
ever
but
its
not
your
run
of
the
mill
malt
liquor
some
vegetable
note
in
the
middle
there
which
isnt
super
pleasant
but
overall
a
sweet
malty
if
forgettable
lager
o
this
is
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
at
8
5
and
being
a
malt
liquor
and
being
reasonably
priced
and
considering
the
target
audience
vsl
is
above
average
i
cant
understand
why
schlitz
felt
that
there
was
a
need
to
make
a
beer
to
bridge
the
8
2
abv
bull
ice
and
8
5
gap
at
9
this
would
be
much
more
impressive
if
id
never
had
bull
ice
id
find
vsl
to
be
much
better
but
unfortunately
bull
ice
is
one
of
my
favorite
high
gravities
and
it
kicks
the
hell
out
of
this
overall
i
guess
schlitz
made
this
to
appeal
to
the
high
gravity
drinker
that
appreciates
a
harsher
taste
i
personally
enjoy
this
beer
at
only
0
99
a
can
you
really
cant
complain
unless
your
a
rich
snob
that
drinks
3
floyds
every
night
which
is
produced
in
my
hometown
of
munster
anyways
its
not
all
that
bad
it
doesnt
have
tat
high
alcohol
taste
which
i
personally
like
yet
it
still
gives
you
a
decent
buzz
after
two
cans
or
so
this
is
coming
from
someone
that
is
young
yet
has
tasted
almost
every
craft
beer
sold
in
your
typical
nice
liquor
store
it
may
not
be
the
best
around
but
its
a
good
value
for
those
looking
to
save
money
and
get
a
buzz
without
the
swill
hangover
really
not
a
bad
choice
when
you
need
to
settle
down
and
dont
want
to
open
that
lovely
ommegang
that
waits
patiently
in
the
fridge
for
a
worthy
night
from
the
710
ml
can
marked
apr0212e07020447
sampled
on
november
30
2011
poured
into
a
heilemans
old
style
pint
glass
well
why
not
it
is
a
highly
agitated
carbonated
pale
yellow
to
offgold
with
a
goodly
amount
of
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
of
corn
and
sweet
malts
with
a
crisp
hop
drop
it
does
not
smell
high
in
alcohol
the
body
is
a
little
better
than
light
but
not
quite
medium
the
taste
has
that
bitter
malt
liquor
taste
but
a
bit
more
palatable
than
other
malt
liquors
out
there
an
almost
clean
aftertaste
i
said
almost
because
there
is
a
rather
biting
lingering
effect
i
rated
this
by
style
not
by
its
craft
that
its
like
cheap
champagne
not
to
be
confused
with
mhl
the
champagne
of
beers
sticks
to
the
mouth
in
probably
the
most
unpleasant
way
like
drinking
not
rinsing
with
a
glass
of
mouth
wash
finishes
with
an
alcohol
tingle
and
perhaps
stale
beer
funk
like
what
i
used
to
smell
in
my
grandfathers
basement
overall
definitely
not
good
however
not
the
worst
high
gravity
ive
had
decent
if
i
was
still
in
college
and
looking
for
a
cheap
pregamer
buzz
before
a
kegger
or
a
night
at
the
bar
pours
a
crystal
clear
deep
straw
bordering
on
golden
color
with
a
good
two
finger
bubbly
white
head
that
shows
some
decent
staying
power
and
lace
yup
looks
like
a
macro
lager
all
right
smells
of
sweet
grainy
malt
with
faint
wisps
of
creamed
corn
and
alcohol
smells
a
little
better
than
i
thought
it
would
taste
is
kind
of
what
i
expected
sweet
grainy
malts
with
maybe
a
hint
of
cherry
or
apricot
really
bitter
alcohol
burn
into
the
finish
lots
and
lots
of
bubbles
medium
body
with
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
honestly
if
they
put
some
hops
in
here
it
wouldnt
be
half
bad
as
is
this
serves
its
purpose
a
cheap
quick
drunk
i
do
enjoy
purchasing
24
oz
of
8
5
beer
for
1
69
if
only
todays
craft
brewers
could
bring
us
that
level
of
value
for
our
money
a
crescendo
of
foulness
as
it
warms
potentially
culminating
into
vomiting
and
passing
out
or
vise
versa
there
are
better
ways
to
anesthetize
the
mind
though
i
guess
they
dont
get
any
cheaper
than
this
aroma
is
actually
better
than
i
expected
nothing
to
write
home
about
as
the
old
cliche
goes
but
rather
nice
it
is
strong
fruity
mainly
apple
and
malty
better
than
what
i
expected
from
a
beer
of
this
type
it
pours
a
rather
uninspiring
clear
wan
yellow
with
a
rather
typical
white
head
flavor
is
not
too
shabby
though
stronger
and
fuller
than
i
expected
malty
and
fruity
with
a
bit
of
a
nip
its
actually
a
little
enjoyable
texture
is
smooth
and
just
a
bit
fizzy
no
big
shakes
but
better
than
most
industrial
swill
i
have
had
ok
if
there
isnt
much
else
to
drink
poured
out
of
a
24
oz
can
into
a
beer
stein
what
head
it
had
disappeared
within
seconds
leaving
absolutely
nothing
the
colour
was
surprisingly
light
it
looks
like
a
light
beer
its
light
yellowish
gold
the
smell
is
that
of
sweet
metal
thats
it
i
was
afraid
to
taste
it
but
was
relieved
when
i
did
it
tasted
much
better
than
the
smell
id
even
say
it
tastes
better
than
all
the
high
gravity
lagers
ive
had
other
than
oe
hg800
it
has
a
bitter
taste
that
tastes
lightly
of
metal
it
really
is
quite
smooth
some
alchol
burn
but
not
until
the
aftertaste
its
somewhat
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
the
nauseating
bit
is
the
taste
of
the
actual
malt
its
pretty
bad
within
the
category
of
malt
liquor
this
stuffs
pretty
bad
however
i
think
that
modern
high
gravity
lagers
should
not
be
considered
in
the
same
category
its
a
totally
different
style
and
within
that
style
there
are
worse
things
for
sure
ahem
steel
reserve
hmmm
what
to
say
about
this
it
was
bought
at
a
gas
station
i
had
no
idea
what
it
was
when
i
saw
it
i
bought
it
because
i
was
in
the
getocurious
mode
i
drove
home
thinking
it
would
taste
like
leprous
piss
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
i
did
not
vomit
upon
swallowing
it
had
a
very
sweet
cornadjunct
taste
and
not
much
alcohol
they
hid
the
before
taste
very
well
and
the
aftertaste
was
near
nonexistent
i
may
buy
it
agian
when
in
the
getocurious
mode
boy
does
this
one
bring
back
some
memories
how
can
anyone
forget
a
name
like
schlitz
this
brew
was
a
high
octane
attempt
from
a
low
end
brewery
yellow
in
color
white
head
rather
fluffy
that
fades
quickly
the
can
design
was
probably
the
best
part
of
this
brew
i
drank
it
with
a
meal
just
to
help
with
the
drinking
process
notes
its
surprisingly
light
and
drinkable
dense
two
finger
head
quickly
fading
but
leaving
a
broken
and
clinging
lace
color
is
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smell
is
a
muted
odor
of
wet
and
musty
cereal
grains
taste
is
that
of
wet
malt
and
cereal
grains
very
unpleasing
to
my
palate
mouthfeel
is
poor
there
is
a
bit
of
tingle
from
the
carbonation
but
it
is
sticky
and
dry
on
the
top
of
my
mouth
and
soft
palate
i
will
make
just
about
every
excuse
to
not
drink
this
again
unless
i
am
really
drunk
d
the
smell
is
so
harsh
it
makes
each
sip
so
hard
to
bare
but
who
am
i
kidding
here
its
a
poor
mans
liquor
very
drinkable
considering
the
high
gravity
of
8
5
for
a
macro
lager
i
would
still
stick
with
the
blue
bull
for
a
session
brew
however
stop
2
on
the
swill
tour
2010
the
others
worked
on
a
shiner
bock
before
this
one
it
pours
a
clear
urine
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
is
crappy
wheat
covered
up
by
the
most
saccharine
corn
syrup
smell
that
has
yet
to
grace
my
strils
the
hell
the
taste
is
well
nasty
even
low
expectations
have
been
dashed
by
the
pain
of
being
so
very
very
right
about
something
being
so
very
very
wrong
its
its
just
terrible
i
dont
know
what
to
say
the
sweetness
is
sadly
dulled
thats
right
i
said
sadly
and
some
brassy
corn
husk
is
left
to
beat
my
buds
faces
in
norrisstyle
my
nipples
are
hard
just
drinking
this
horribility
the
lickuh
is
palpable
the
body
is
heavier
than
it
should
be
with
a
sharply
moderate
carbonation
and
a
brutal
finish
man
the
more
i
drink
this
the
more
i
want
to
lick
my
own
armpit
to
rid
my
tongue
of
the
taste
overall
no
dont
do
this
to
yourself
please
this
pours
a
very
pale
straw
color
the
rice
and
corn
sugars
are
very
prominent
in
the
smell
there
is
a
savior
smell
in
the
fact
that
maybe
if
there
are
hops
in
it
there
is
an
orangemango
smell
to
the
back
and
only
very
faint
the
taste
is
actually
not
as
bad
upfront
as
i
would
have
expected
but
that
doesnt
make
it
pleasant
the
liquor
taste
is
akin
to
a
terrible
sake
it
isnt
horrid
and
appalling
wait
i
take
that
back
this
is
progressively
harder
to
drink
as
i
go
along
making
me
wish
that
hadnt
just
said
those
things
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
unpleasant
very
smooth
my
ass
this
is
currently
giving
all
of
us
indigestion
this
is
horrid
and
i
cant
in
good
conscience
recommend
this
to
anyone
not
doing
this
to
harm
themselves
beer
is
medium
in
body
minimal
carbonation
in
the
mouth
for
such
a
high
alcohol
its
not
sweet
at
all
its
nice
and
pilsner
malty
not
dry
pretty
good
actually
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
a
nice
color
obviously
its
going
to
be
crystal
clear
lots
of
fizz
and
foam
s
sort
of
sicky
sweet
like
that
real
shitty
moonshine
you
can
still
get
here
in
east
tn
t
way
to
sweet
and
a
little
medicine
like
grainy
gets
a
little
less
mediciney
and
more
grainy
as
it
warms
up
a
bit
strainge
rancid
apple
and
pear
notes
no
hops
what
so
ever
could
use
a
little
bitterness
m
heavy
and
syrpy
at
first
thins
out
a
little
as
it
warms
the
foam
does
little
to
dry
it
out
d
too
heavy
to
swill
but
gets
much
more
pleasent
after
youve
half
drained
it
not
pleasent
so
much
as
tolerable
with
the
buzz
youve
recently
aquired
not
worth
the
buzz
you
get
just
as
drunk
off
two
big
cans
of
high
life
and
its
not
nearly
as
toxic
cheers
overall
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
drink
that
is
created
for
the
alcohol
the
flavor
smell
and
mouth
feel
are
all
sub
par
but
the
alcohol
is
the
main
reason
to
drink
this
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
primarily
of
malts
taste
is
mostly
of
alcohol
some
malts
and
grains
not
all
that
good
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
there
is
nothing
special
about
this
beer
d
i
usually
finish
off
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
with
this
beer
the
taste
is
good
given
the
alcohol
level
and
this
is
usually
a
good
finish
also
this
stuff
is
cheap
satisfied
with
it
and
would
drink
it
again
very
faint
aroma
of
corn
has
the
same
golden
color
typical
of
mass
american
lagers
pours
a
thick
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
sweet
and
dry
with
a
surprisingly
absent
alcohol
tinge
slick
but
not
bad
on
the
palate
finishes
sweet
crisp
and
bitter
at
first
i
thought
it
was
awful
by
the
end
of
the
can
i
thought
it
was
pretty
tolerable
i
suppose
thats
a
testament
to
the
8
5
abv
nothing
special
here
folks
just
another
cheap
drunk
this
one
will
get
you
drunk
in
a
hurry
the
sharp
rough
alcohol
is
readily
apparent
and
is
only
masked
by
some
light
grainy
malts
and
carbonation
i
do
not
detect
any
bitterness
from
hops
but
the
heavy
alcohol
dries
out
the
finish
enough
to
not
taste
sweet
i
would
much
rather
tame
the
blue
bull
than
this
golden
beast
v
s
l
my
ass
there
is
nothing
smooth
about
it
highly
unlikely
i
will
be
buying
this
one
again
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
active
carbonation
helps
to
break
the
sweetness
up
lots
of
raw
boozey
alcohol
present
in
the
mouthfeel
not
anything
to
brag
about
here
this
is
straight
up
non
gag
inducing
malt
liquor
buzz
beer
per
style
the
flavor
is
above
average
with
a
frosted
cereal
sweetness
and
some
pale
malts
hops
are
slight
floral
and
drowned
out
by
corn
and
sugary
fusels
the
booze
isnt
overwhelming
though
but
it
does
add
a
metal
twang
to
the
finish
that
with
the
alcohol
warms
all
the
way
down
soapy
bubbly
mouthfeel
with
a
mediumlight
body
not
sure
if
its
the
adjuncts
or
the
plastic
from
the
inside
of
the
pimp
cup
but
i
can
feel
a
headache
coming
on
from
this
beer
oh
well
down
the
hatch
the
finger
of
bonewhite
head
that
resulted
from
my
pour
quickly
dissipated
into
wisps
nose
was
sweet
but
not
pungent
like
schlitz
malt
liquor
o
m
l
blue
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lightly
sweet
but
fusel
taste
on
the
tongue
finish
was
mostly
smooth
except
on
the
extreme
finish
when
i
caught
a
slight
alcohol
burn
v
s
too
smooth
for
its
abv
i
may
need
to
lay
down
after
this
nothing
im
gonna
keep
my
fridge
stocked
up
with
but
if
im
trying
to
get
hammered
for
cheap
and
not
impress
anyone
ill
drink
it
again
i
would
much
prefer
to
have
this
in
a
40
oz
bottle
not
impressive
by
much
but
its
ok
to
try
at
least
once
on
the
other
hand
this
is
brewed
to
deliver
alcohol
into
the
system
as
quickly
and
painlessly
as
possible
to
its
credit
it
does
a
fine
job
of
doing
so
honey
golden
with
a
fat
creamy
off
white
head
that
leaves
splotches
of
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
grits
cereal
grain
and
the
faintest
suggestion
of
cluster
hops
tastes
of
toasted
grain
and
sweet
malt
with
some
decent
bitterness
to
balance
warmingly
alcoholic
in
the
finish
lighter
bodied
for
the
style
and
nicely
carbonated
suprisingly
easy
to
drink
great
beer
to
wash
down
some
wings
or
barbecue
a
fine
example
of
the
style
note
to
self
dont
try
to
pick
up
any
chics
with
this
one
it
hits
too
hard
to
fast
overall
i
dont
hate
it
drinkability
it
is
drinkable
and
i
could
see
having
one
of
these
while
im
out
barbecuing
saving
the
better
heavier
beers
for
the
meal
this
beer
poured
yellow
with
a
small
head
and
a
ton
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
sweet
corn
adjunct
the
taste
is
surprisingly
smooth
just
some
sweet
corn
with
a
little
alcohol
heat
in
the
back
the
mouthfeel
has
enough
carbonation
to
be
crisp
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
excels
at
getting
you
from
zero
to
drunk
in
a
short
amount
of
time
its
not
exactly
tasty
but
its
also
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
mouthfeel
it
lives
up
to
its
title
as
a
very
smooth
lager
almost
creamy
props
to
pegasus
for
the
experience
saw
this
one
in
a
random
liquor
store
in
wisconsin
and
knew
i
had
to
try
it
haha
pours
a
dark
golden
color
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
that
fell
quickly
leaving
some
surprisingly
decent
lacing
aroma
is
all
corn
and
husky
grainy
malts
light
sweetness
in
the
nose
taste
is
sweet
a
lot
of
corn
sugar
virtually
no
hops
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
is
crisp
no
aftertaste
whatsoever
this
is
actually
not
a
horrible
malt
liquor
ive
had
much
worse
in
my
day
but
that
doesnt
mean
i
want
several
of
these
at
a
time
presentation
packaged
in
a
sixteenounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
twenty
ounce
pilsener
glass
was
getting
decent
reviews
i
couldnt
find
it
so
i
tried
this
instead

the
v
s
l
is
short
for
very
smooth
lager
really
thought
i
out
of
a
24
oz
can
this
beer
was
a
straw
gold
color
with
a
huge
three
finger
creamcolored
head
mediocre
retention
and
scattered
streaks
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
all
corn
and
grain
mash
with
some
sour
malt
underneath
the
flavors
were
at
first
a
hint
of
bitterness
quickly
followed
by
some
generic
sweetened
malt
hints
of
bananas
in
the
fruity
alcohol
esters
and
yeasty
notes
the
flavors
turned
south
as
it
warmed
and
the
finish
was
a
little
metallic
still
for
8
5
the
punch
is
well
hidden
i
found
it
hard
to
deny
the
very
smooth
part
as
far
as
malts
liquors
go
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumfull
and
slick
and
the
carbonation
subtle
but
again
pretty
good
for
the
style
yall
may
think
im
crazy
for
writing
it
but
for
the
malt
liqour
style
this
one
is
very
good
id
even
say
it
is
as
good
as
for
example
dads
little
helper
by
the
rogue
company
a
beer
that
is
harder
to
find
and
costs
three
to
four
times
what
this
did
with
not
much
of
a
beer
though
drinkability
certainly
the
smoothest
malt
liquor
ive
begrudgingly
downed
during
my
time
on
this
planet
i
always
try
to
rate
to
style
but
its
difficult
when
a
beer
is
just
plain
offensive
perhaps
it
is
a
decent
malt
liquor
i
wouldnt
know
honestly
i
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
on
my
way
back
from
the
bar
the
taste
is
sweetish
with
an
interesting
zesty
acloholic
spiciness
that
stays
very
smooth
just
hinting
at
the
abv
and
finishes
with
a
nice
bite
its
fruity
lightly
spicy
with
a
light
aromatic
grain
quality
mostly
noticeable
in
the
finish
along
with
grapes
and
grape
peel
not
the
worst
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
but
still
a
malt
liquor
but
the
important
thing
is
that
i
got
drunk
md
light
body
of
course
slightly
tart
ya
know
if
you
had
to
drink
a
malt
liquor
this
would
be
a
decent
one
to
pick
up
1
50
for
a
24
oz
can
not
bad
d
cant
feel
the
booziness
in
this
beer
but
it
is
still
drinkable
for
a
malt
liquor
but
really
close
to
being
not
tolerable
steel
reserve
is
much
better
choice
schlitz
high
gravity
v
s
l
very
smooth
lager
is
a
classic
malt
liquor
that
comes
through
where
it
matters
most
flavor
congratulations
to
jos
schlitz
brewing
co
for
winning
both
malt
likkapalooza
i
schlitz
malt
liquor
bull
and
malt
likkapalooza
x
it
starts
malty
and
sweet
swathed
in
alcohol
and
it
ends
maltysweet
and
swathed
in
alcohol
surprising
but
hops
whaaa
no
theyre
there
just
in
minor
measure
as
expected
and
the
maltiness
is
really
well
done
for
the
style
its
pretty
impressively
welldone
one
of
my
favorite
malt
liquors
not
bad
for
a
malt
liquor
final
grade
2
17
a
d
710
ml
might
have
been
a
little
ambitious
red
bull
strong
is
drinkable
sort
of
in
the
same
sense
that
a
charred
welldone
steak
is
edible
burnt
steak
has
some
nutritional
value
and
this
beer
will
slide
down
your
gullet
and
accomplish
its
purpose
if
youre
determined
enough
but
why
punish
yourself
i
realize
im
not
the
target
demographic
for
beers
like
this
but
its
possible
to
make
a
highgravity
lager
that
doesnt
taste
like
total
shit
those
molsonbudweiser
shots
would
be
greatly
preferable
overall
if
you
are
looking
for
a
gritty
beer
that
makes
you
feel
like
you
live
in
the
basement
of
tom
waits
speakeasy
you
cant
go
wrong
with
the
red
bull
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
clear
straw
with
a
nice
soapy
foam
and
no
lace
aroma
of
corn
standard
beer
smell
some
grains
little
to
no
hops
in
the
taste
pretty
nondescript
corn
light
malt
alittle
sweet
with
almost
no
bitterness
very
little
alcohol
noticed
either
mouthfeel
is
lighter
bodied
alittle
flabby
and
watery
overall
a
decent
malt
liqour
not
offensive
but
not
strong
either
malt
liquor
light
go
buy
it
try
it
add
it
to
your
list
and
then
forget
it
24oz
can
into
a
16
oz
budweiser
glass
for
what
it
is
meant
to
be
this
one
hits
the
mark
malt
liquors
are
meant
to
get
you
feeling
good
quickly
and
2
of
these
would
do
just
that
goes
down
easy
and
doesnt
have
the
offending
alcohol
taste
as
other
malt
liquors
tend
to
have
its
nearly
flavorless
its
odd
slight
aftertaste
kind
of
grainy
light
in
body
not
very
interesting
oh
well
vsl
is
a
good
beer
i
swear
rjt
i
got
twoplus
fingers
worth
of
foamy
fizzing
popping
bone
white
head
that
was
going
down
like
an
express
elevator
to
the
basement
right
after
the
pour
leaving
a
lot
of
sticky
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
pale
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
lagersweet
not
bad
for
the
style
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
crispness
that
was
unexpected
on
the
tongue
it
did
not
taste
rushed
or
skimped
on
but
was
actually
kind
of
pleasant
to
drink
finish
was
slightly
dry
and
a
little
malty
but
still
not
unpleasant
given
its
relatively
low
abv
i
would
put
it
in
the
second
tier
as
far
as
cooler
space
is
concerned
it
does
not
rate
moving
something
else
aside
but
i
would
drink
it
ahead
of
many
of
its
brethren
in
the
style
i
might
also
feel
kind
of
embarrassed
about
being
seen
with
it
kind
of
like
the
old
saw
about
scooters
and
fat
chicks
theyre
both
fun
to
ride
until
your
buddies
catch
you
doing
it
grabbed
the
menacing
710ml
can
looks
sweet
just
what
a
malt
can
should
like
tall
and
with
a
menacing
animal
on
it
anyway
i
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
nice
ambery
stock
malt
liquor
color
very
clear
and
had
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
i
like
smells
like
every
other
malt
like
rotten
veggies
its
malt
thats
what
you
get
d
this
is
an
amazing
malt
liquor
booze
is
somewhat
balanced
finishes
sweet
and
not
overly
boozy
and
extremely
smoooth
mouthfeel
thin
and
slick
really
good
drinkability
on
this
one
when
its
nice
and
cold
top
5
malt
liquors
of
all
time
nice
and
high
abv
great
taste
what
more
do
you
need
everynow
and
then
its
nice
to
venture
into
a
city
market
store
and
pick
up
an
economical
malt
shit
liquor
this
22
ouncer
was
labeled
red
bull
xtra
long
malt
liquor
the
abv
printed
on
the
bottle
was
5
9
the
beer
poured
a
pours
light
yellow
color
with
strong
carbonation
the
white
head
didnt
last
long
the
aroma
is
malty
corny
and
slightly
skunked
virtually
no
hop
presence
at
all
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
nothing
that
unpleasant
its
just
very
corn
based
light
and
caronated
feel
this
is
moderatly
drinkable
im
not
sure
i
would
do
a
40
without
wanting
to
barf
but
that
can
be
a
challenge
for
another
day
not
a
good
beer
its
got
way
too
much
alcohol
flavor
to
be
enjoyable
if
you
want
malt
liquor
there
are
better
brands
to
be
had
like
oe800
crisp
but
not
clean
on
the
palate
with
a
bit
of
dryness
and
a
lingering
grainy
texture
starchy
and
weak
at
best
the
remnants
left
on
the
tongue
are
unpleasant
i
think
ive
had
all
i
can
take
the
rest
is
going
down
the
drain
and
that
doesnt
happen
too
often
at
my
house
use
common
sense
and
steer
clear
because
i
doubt
anyone
else
thinks
that
joke
is
nearly
as
funny
as
i
do
this
is
the
stuff
domestic
violence
is
made
of
pours
a
clear
pee
yellow
w
a
tinge
of
kidneyfailure
orange
faint
white
head
leaving
no
lacing
at
all
in
the
big
mug
smells
vinous
and
skunked
not
much
else
taste
is
thick
and
adjunctfilled
maybe
a
hop
note
somewhere
a
stickysweet
medcloying
body
good
co2
at
least
sorry
but
yuck
i
drank
a
belgian
strong
pale
ale
before
this
and
i
think
im
going
to
throw
that
up
and
drink
it
again
before
i
finish
the
last
23
of
this
22
oz
of
bile
oddly
enough
the
beer
was
better
out
of
the
can
than
the
glass
i
guess
a
lack
of
smelling
the
beer
increased
the
flavor
and
drinkabiltiy
in
short
next
time
i
will
drink
this
from
the
can
drinkable
only
if
desperate
for
a
quick
cheap
buzz
its
better
to
drink
from
the
bottle
in
a
bag
so
you
dont
see
it
and
more
important
and
dont
smell
it
shockingly
palatable
malt
liquor
and
dirt
cheap
too
not
much
aroma
not
very
long
lasting
head
and
very
little
mouthfeel
flavor
is
very
weak
but
innofensive
if
you
want
a
fairly
strong
middle
of
the
road
for
malt
liquors
easy
to
pound
beer
this
is
a
good
bet
the
bull
is
kind
of
cool
looking
too
go
get
a
40
as
cheap
beers
go
this
one
is
the
big
bull
if
you
want
to
get
messed
up
quickly
bull
is
the
way
to
go
the
odd
flavoring
of
beer
mixed
with
something
is
unique
starts
heavy
and
full
of
said
flavor
doing
a
drive
by
on
your
tongue
just
make
sure
that
you
drink
this
before
it
gets
warm
have
played
ahole
with
bull
before
and
woke
up
sleeping
in
a
bush
outside
of
my
room
dangerous
stuff
but
a
fun
time
as
dope
as
a
forty
is
going
to
get
i
did
at
least
pour
it
into
my
glass
while
still
in
the
brown
paper
bag
clear
yellow
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
strong
malt
aroma
with
hints
of
corn
the
taste
was
very
much
like
the
aroma
the
only
difference
was
that
the
corn
was
more
pronounced
as
fly
as
a
forty
is
gonna
get
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
so
light
yellow
in
color
that
is
almost
clear
white
head
dissipates
very
quickly
smells
surprisingly
malty
for
being
so
clear
which
combines
with
the
corn
smell
to
make
something
that
is
not
that
bad
for
being
of
the
malt
liquor
ilk
fullbodied
and
lightly
malted
this
beer
does
a
wondeful
job
of
hiding
that
pesky
7
1
abv
tastes
a
lot
like
many
other
macros
but
somehow
this
doesnt
have
any
of
the
skunky
or
foul
adjunct
tastes
that
many
do
not
a
bad
buy
for
4
50
for
a
6
pack
of
16
oz
cans
good
clean
body
not
to
much
carbonation
so
it
wont
slow
you
down
not
an
unplesent
aftertaste
i
almost
drank
3
40oz
this
is
not
bad
for
what
it
is
and
what
it
dose
its
not
beer
and
its
not
trying
to
be
i
have
not
had
a
malt
liquor
beer
in
a
long
time
i
cant
imagine
this
being
one
of
the
better
ones
you
can
skip
it
crystal
clear
pale
gold
body
topped
by
a
bright
white
head
thats
inandout
in
nothing
flat
the
aroma
is
heavily
estery
alot
of
fruitiness
very
little
malt
no
hops
the
body
is
mediumlight
but
the
mouthfeel
is
dull
the
flavor
is
aggressive
in
everything
but
what
a
good
beer
should
be
rough
the
malt
that
is
present
is
sweet
and
basic
but
lacking
in
character
there
are
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
finish
leaves
a
sweet
spot
at
the
front
of
the
tongue
and
a
slight
stickiness
at
the
back
of
the
throat
not
alot
of
good
things
to
say
about
this
beer
there
are
much
better
choices
in
the
malt
liquor
category
i
didnt
pick
up
on
any
plastic
can
liner
taste
or
any
hops
with
the
24oz
can
schlitz
red
bull
but
all
the
same
we
will
be
seeing
each
other
again
uffda
take
schlitz
malt
liquor
bull
and
ratchet
it
up
a
notch
yikes
actually
if
you
can
get
by
all
the
adjunct
unpleasantness
there
is
a
bit
of
hop
bite
on
the
tongue
that
compliments
the
alcohol
kick
this
is
the
high
octane
quick
buzz
brew
for
those
who
like
the
tongue
tingling
sensation
of
just
the
kiss
of
the
hops
schlitz
products
my
foray
into
malt
liquor
territory
has
left
me
feeling
comfortably
numb
but
not
totally
stupid
try
red
bull
for
yourself
you
might
like
it
but
your
liver
might
not
overall
this
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
but
it
is
more
or
less
what
im
looking
for
in
a
high
abv
lager
its
refreshing
and
not
that
heavy
but
has
tons
of
flavor
o
ugh
whatever
i
dont
know
why
we
kept
doing
this
this
is
okay
for
a
malt
liquor
meaning
is
just
plain
sucks
instead
of
royally
sucking
d
i
found
this
surprisingly
enjoyable
it
wasnt
as
good
as
the
dogfish
or
midnight
sun
offerings
but
it
was
a
passable
highgravity
lager
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
for
an
american
style
lager
its
pretty
good
i
dont
know
that
i
would
drink
this
again
over
any
of
the
thousands
of
amazing
ales
that
are
out
there
come
to
think
of
it
i
cant
imagine
why
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
i
like
the
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
its
just
not
exciting
so
there
is
no
reason
to
come
back
this
may
be
a
good
craft
brew
for
people
just
getting
into
craft
brews
or
transitioning
from
american
style
lagers
o
an
interesting
study
in
imperial
beers
really
this
would
be
much
better
with
a
lower
abv
and
more
attention
to
taste
vs
gimmick
worth
trying
but
not
really
worth
having
a
spare
bottle
might
age
it
a
little
but
the
style
isnt
known
for
getting
any
better
not
what
youd
want
a
tankard
of
but
its
an
interesting
glass
of
something
strong
and
sweet
minus
the
belgian
musk
of
a
golden
ale
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
compared
to
cheap
convenience
store
malt
liquor
but
not
drinkable
compared
to
any
well
conceived
craft
id
imagine
this
could
be
a
good
gateway
beer
if
you
were
trying
to
convert
a
homeless
person
with
a
winning
scratcher
to
something
better
but
its
not
going
to
win
anyone
over
who
already
appreciates
the
finer
things
poured
a
light
yelloworange
with
a
smallish
head
that
dissipated
completely
there
was
little
or
no
lacing
nose
was
caramel
lemon
pale
malt
and
corn
taste
was
boozy
and
sweet
with
elements
of
lemon
honey
caramel
and
grains
carbonation
was
light
and
it
felt
thin
though
sticky
while
a
bit
too
sweet
and
thin
for
me
to
drink
much
of
this
it
wasnt
awful
i
admit
i
wasnt
expecting
much
here
so
it
is
not
a
shock
that
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
like
most
a
malt
liquor
was
last
tried
in
high
school
when
friends
wanted
to
get
drunk
and
could
care
less
why
or
how
and
certainly
didnt
care
about
anything
tasting
good
as
far
as
this
beer
goes
it
is
a
good
example
of
a
craft
malt
liquor
or
as
lightning
is
calling
it
preprohibition
style
but
basically
anything
over
8
with
a
substantial
amount
of
adjuncts
is
a
malt
liquor
in
my
book
in
which
case
this
is
on
the
better
side
of
most
but
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
this
a
tasty
beverage
either
d
not
so
sure
i
want
too
much
more
of
this
i
have
another
bomber
maybe
i
can
divvy
it
up
with
some
camping
buddies
next
weekend
d
definitely
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
available
usually
i
drink
them
for
the
novelty
but
this
wasnt
all
that
bad
ionizer
lager
is
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
from
this
brewery
yet
the
fact
that
its
hard
to
categorize
makes
it
somewhat
intriguing
and
even
though
theres
no
real
flavor
hook
im
enjoying
the
hell
out
of
the
bomber
must
be
the
alcohol
talking
note
to
the
brewers
give
some
serious
thought
to
belgian
yeast
trust
me
d
this
is
a
sneaky
little
bugger
atch
out
it
drinks
quick
and
easy
but
packs
a
whollop
a
preprohibition
lager
huh
interesting
if
thats
indeed
malt
liquor
this
isnt
my
first
encounter
it
is
a
little
reminiscent
of
my
memory
of
malt
liquors
but
its
quite
a
bit
better
than
those
as
a
whole
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
some
of
the
corn
flavor
could
be
backed
down
thatd
be
an
immediate
improvement
but
its
definitely
worth
a
try
medium
body
with
plenty
alcohol
a
sweet
craft
maltliquor
that
rivals
any
american
macro
if
you
like
em
sahweeet
this
brew
is
for
you
drinkability
is
moderate
thickly
sweet
lager
that
almost
feels
belgianish
even
at
8abv
there
is
good
balance
and
flavor
going
on
here
very
unique
style
of
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
o
overall
it
was
very
average
for
a
malt
liquor
of
this
strenght
id
have
again
if
with
i
were
with
my
friends
remember
i
am
in
fact
only
23
so
i
go
to
quite
a
bit
of
college
parties
no
true
complains
its
1
19
for
a
24
ouncer
no
it
isnt
a
craft
beer
but
if
im
heading
up
to
emu
wmu
msu
or
u
of
m
anytime
soon
youre
damn
right
ill
be
picking
some
of
these
up
big
thanks
goes
out
to
mbrausen
for
sending
me
this
one
to
tick
thanks
buddy
served
from
bottle
into
a
duvel
kishimoto
tulip
class
it
up
poured
a
golden
pale
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
corn
sugar
prune
juice
and
despair
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
fruit
sugar
prune
juice
corn
grain
alcohol
and
crushed
palate
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
definitely
a
terrible
brew
who
in
the
hell
thought
this
would
be
a
good
idea
to
brew
there
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
one
and
i
have
to
be
honest
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
any
of
it
i
could
see
this
being
cool
as
a
novelty
beer
but
why
the
hell
would
you
put
it
in
a
40
oz
bottle
come
on
guys
i
could
see
being
forced
to
sip
on
this
one
as
an
alternative
to
waterboarding
i
would
only
ever
get
this
one
again
to
set
at
the
back
of
my
fridge
and
unleash
its
fury
on
an
unsuspecting
victim
if
this
is
you
reading
this
avoid
at
all
costs
if
this
is
for
a
funny
joke
definitely
buy
it
and
have
the
camera
ready
upon
the
first
sip
you
will
thank
me
either
way
overall
i
wouldnt
drink
this
twice
but
its
not
the
worst
thing
ive
ever
had
i
dont
give
a
schlitz
for
this
evil
eye
simply
means
looks
are
deceiving
despite
a
slightly
sweet
texture
this
beer
is
a
kick
in
the
mouth
its
what
you
can
expect
from
any
malt
liquor
with
a
10
0
or
greater
abv
by
that
i
mean
its
cringeworthy
something
among
sour
grapes
and
water
gathered
from
a
mason
jar
that
once
held
a
pigfetus
personally
i
dont
find
it
too
attractive
i
used
to
settle
for
it
in
high
school
but
my
old
buddies
and
i
would
spend
the
whole
time
talking
about
how
nasty
the
stuff
was
if
youre
desperate
for
a
good
buzz
however
it
can
get
you
there
not
exactly
what
id
call
worth
it
though
for
some
id
imagine
it
gets
the
job
done
for
any
selfrespecting
individual
no
maybe
not
the
worst
out
there
but
its
blindly
scraping
at
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
only
for
the
masochistic
i
should
have
waited
a
day
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
open
on
911
o
its
a
malt
liquor
and
its
not
good
dont
drink
this
dont
ever
do
one
of
these
tastings
either
d
im
actually
hugely
disappointed
as
this
was
largely
average
for
the
style
perhaps
it
was
the
year
of
cellaring
before
i
could
finally
get
the
tasting
off
the
ground
but
this
didnt
live
up
to
the
hype
as
being
the
worst
beer
on
ba
i
would
drink
this
over
indian
wells
any
day
of
the
week
just
slam
this
as
fast
as
you
can
once
you
get
the
feel
for
it
thats
the
only
utility
it
has
in
the
world
poured
a
dull
orange
straw
color
with
no
head
and
no
lace
a
decenr
amount
of
of
caronation
coming
up
from
the
bottom
smell
was
light
grain
and
cornwith
a
touh
of
alcohol
not
impressed
but
was
i
expecting
to
be
taste
was
rather
bland
as
well
just
a
grainey
malty
cheap
mess
overall
cmon
man
what
do
you
expext
this
was
prety
mch
a
forty
funny
d
this
beer
is
horrible
well
i
dont
think
horrible
is
the
right
word
to
describe
it
this
is
a
terrible
first
beer
of
the
night
and
for
the
tasting
the
abv
is
off
putting
making
this
beer
a
harder
one
to
drink
but
the
alcohol
flavor
isnt
as
big
as
i
thought
it
would
be
still
never
want
to
try
this
beer
at
all
ever
again
im
scared
to
evil
eye
and
maybe
to
scared
to
ever
trust
a
homeless
buy
again
super
cheap
beer
should
have
there
own
rating
system
not
exactly
what
i
would
call
drinkable
hi
test
bad
home
brew
from
a
can
try
this
once
maybe
cheers
pale
yellow
with
a
dingy
off
white
head
of
foam
the
smell
is
creamed
corn
green
apple
and
fusel
alcohol
the
flavor
is
green
apple
skin
and
cheap
vodka
with
plenty
of
sweet
corn
to
get
the
abv
potent
the
alcohol
is
hot
in
the
finish
this
stuff
is
pretty
rank
the
worst
tasting
malt
liquor
ive
had
in
a
while
for
sure
sour
green
apples
in
the
aroma
evil
malt
alurking
same
sour
mash
apple
cider
in
the
quaff
a
real
funky
monkey
thin
bodied
more
malt
liquor
than
beer
cripe
is
this
a
vile
concoction
my
stomach
is
turning
into
knots
finishing
this
will
be
a
challenge
but
im
up
for
it
d
eh
its
ok
but
a
poor
example
of
a
malt
liquor
far
too
sweet
and
fruity
tasting
to
imbibe
all
evening
or
even
an
entire
24
oz
can
a
unique
example
of
the
style
but
a
few
sips
is
more
than
enough
i
am
not
sure
how
this
gets
fs
from
folks
but
it
definitely
is
not
impressive
tasted
on
nov
11
2007
24oz
can
i
am
sort
of
afraid
to
even
try
this
one
the
pour
doesnt
look
too
bad
medium
golden
with
a
average
head
cant
knock
it
down
on
appearance
now
for
the
aroma
ummm
i
think
things
are
heading
south
a
little
odd
aroma
of
rotting
fruit
and
jet
fuel
touches
of
bananna
which
i
kind
of
like
i
have
smelled
worse
so
i
cant
destroy
it
on
aroma
time
to
take
a
sip
ok
lets
talk
about
this
for
a
second
i
have
had
worse
actually
i
have
had
alot
worse
than
this
there
is
a
big
boozy
bananna
flavor
which
isnt
half
bad
plus
it
is
strong
trust
me
i
am
not
going
to
drink
the
whole
can
because
i
have
to
go
to
work
tonight
but
if
i
didnt
have
to
work
i
just
might
polish
it
off
purchased
from
the
ice
box
convenient
store
in
steubenville
ohio
alongside
many
other
malt
liquors
the
green
evil
eyes
stood
out
to
me
underneath
evil
eye
on
the
label
it
states
in
spanish
ojo
malo
high
gravity
lager
with
no
abv
listed
on
the
can
only
other
info
listed
is
brewed
by
melanie
brewing
in
cincinatti
oh
along
with
the
government
warning
appears
a
pale
clear
carbonated
apple
juice
hue
with
a
large
bright
white
head
that
has
large
pea
sized
bubbles
of
carbonation
and
dwindles
quick
as
hell
by
the
way
it
was
a
1
99
thats
a
little
steep
for
a
24
oz
can
of
any
malt
liquor
id
figure
even
at
10
percent
abv
we
at
least
see
a
forty
offering
which
ive
seen
in
the
burgh
before
the
smell
is
comprised
of
sweet
alcoholic
creamed
corn
with
some
green
apple
phenols
added
to
the
party
flavor
is
ungodly
such
a
gag
inducing
horribly
made
beer
i
may
not
be
able
to
put
it
into
words
first
off
cloyingly
sweet
creamed
corn
with
burning
alcohol
in
the
throat
is
enough
to
make
one
gag
through
in
the
tart
apple
with
heavy
carbonation
and
my
stomach
is
a
turning
you
actually
develop
a
headache
while
drinking
this
beer
this
should
be
illegal
it
sucks
to
feel
like
a
prohibitionist
mouthfeel
is
cloying
with
harsh
carbonation
and
sticky
residual
sugars
what
a
rough
ride
drinkability
is
god
awful
no
more
about
the
evil
eye
please
its
nice
to
have
fun
at
the
the
expense
of
this
beers
shite
factor
this
is
hands
down
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
drank
wayyy
to
much
alcohol
makes
the
palate
feel
as
if
its
been
a
prisoner
of
war
for
40
years
this
one
kid
gave
me
a
40
of
this
and
since
its
10
abv
it
definitely
fucked
me
up
but
i
felt
like
ass
all
day
the
next
day
the
drinklability
between
the
tastesmell
and
abv
is
simply
awful
if
i
can
drink
crown
royal
straight
but
had
to
pour
this
after
13
can
that
tells
you
something
absolutley
horrid
save
your
money
and
get
a
pbr
or
something
else
instead
if
you
want
crap
beer
at
least
pbr
isnt
offensive
filth
i
like
the
idea
of
malt
liquor
in
a
can
it
is
a
smaller
ration
and
you
cant
see
whats
inside
this
one
has
an
especially
cool
design
as
well
that
unfortunatle
was
the
last
of
the
good
a
yellow
color
with
a
weak
white
head
nose
and
taste
are
of
bitter
grains
and
alcohol
the
body
is
light
and
fizzy
not
a
fan
drinkability
no
thanks
as
for
the
melanie
brewing
co
i
will
say
they
have
enough
testicles
to
keep
churning
out
an
endless
array
of
malt
liquors
pay
heed
all
who
imbibe
this
devils
brew
d
not
at
all
tasty
i
had
a
hard
time
drinking
the
can
that
i
had
not
very
filling
which
is
about
the
only
good
thing
i
can
say
about
it
even
if
youre
a
fan
of
malt
liquors
which
im
not
i
would
not
recommend
this
one
back
when
i
used
to
live
in
missouri
we
had
poor
beer
selection
i
used
to
drink
nothing
but
hard
liquor
and
cheap
beer
i
didnt
get
into
40s
just
because
there
really
werent
too
many
of
them
around
either
to
relive
the
old
days
i
bought
this
cheapo
beer
to
give
it
a
try
with
my
slightly
more
developed
tastes
it
is
drinkable
but
doesnt
taste
much
like
beer
to
me
its
almost
like
a
white
wine
with
more
body
if
you
want
a
cheap
buzz
its
not
too
bad
when
cold
there
are
two
things
that
i
like
about
this
beer
the
first
is
that
it
had
a
surprisingly
decent
appearance
with
lots
of
active
bubbles
and
some
very
good
retention
the
other
is
that
nowhere
on
the
can
these
guys
make
any
claim
that
there
are
any
quality
ingredients
or
purest
hops
like
some
of
these
breweries
try
to
fool
the
uninformed
drinker
with
they
lay
it
out
there
that
this
beer
sucks
but
it
has
a
lot
of
alcohol
thats
exactly
what
you
get
here
and
very
sweet
beer
with
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
heavy
in
carbonation
hardly
appealing
pours
orangeygold
with
a
tiny
bubbled
frothy
white
cap
some
lace
left
after
the
head
dies
fusel
aromas
corn
and
grain
lots
of
adjunct
and
some
veggieogange
peel
but
i
have
experienced
worse
pretty
boozed
up
fusels
are
all
over
this
puppy
corn
vegetal
and
citric
acid
flavours
harsh
and
oily
finish
better
than
predicted
but
not
good
thanks
chris
wow
talk
about
a
nasty
beer
i
saw
the
can
so
i
just
had
to
have
it
as
i
like
to
try
different
malt
liquors
this
one
tasted
a
lot
like
md
2020s
white
grape
but
with
less
alcohol
taste
the
alcohol
was
actually
fairly
subtle
for
how
much
was
in
it
i
guess
if
you
are
looking
to
drink
a
nasty
brew
but
get
a
quick
buzz
this
one
should
be
your
choice
if
you
like
malt
liquors
that
actually
taste
good
then
stay
away
saw
this
sitting
in
the
cooler
while
making
a
friday
night
beer
run
took
one
look
at
the
2
sinister
looking
disembodied
eyes
staring
out
at
me
and
thought
i
gotta
review
this
pours
from
the
24
oz
can
into
a
plastic
16
oz
cup
why
waste
a
glass
on
this
a
typical
urine
yellow
with
a
large
pillowy
head
that
settled
into
a
small
collar
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
cup
surprisingly
low
carbonation
i
expected
a
lot
more
fizziness
smell
is
sugary
sweet
taste
matches
the
aroma
im
sure
they
jacked
the
abv
up
to
10
by
dumping
loads
of
syrup
into
this
stuff
its
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
still
way
too
candy
sweet
mouthfeel
is
the
usual
lager
wateriness
for
the
record
i
bought
this
at
the
beginning
of
a
run
to
pick
up
some
takeout
food
so
it
was
in
an
unair
conditioned
vehicle
for
about
30
minutes
before
sampling
it
would
probably
be
better
ice
cold
but
not
by
much
at
1
49
for
a
24
oz
can
this
stuff
will
be
a
hit
with
brokeass
frat
boys
looking
to
get
laid
and
homeless
guys
panhandling
for
change
if
youre
looking
for
a
tasty
high
quality
beer
to
sip
savor
buy
something
else
if
you
want
a
quick
cheap
buzz
chug
one
ot
these
ice
cold
gettin
drunk
off
a
evil
eye
40
slam
dunk
drinkable
no
not
all
it
is
the
antithesis
of
drinkable
terrible
maybe
the
worse
nonchili
beer
beer
i
have
had
i
am
shocked
at
how
god
awful
it
is
i
purchased
my
24ounce
can
for
1
50
never
again
it
was
torture
the
taste
was
like
a
sweet
and
sour
bud
the
only
use
for
this
beer
is
either
to
play
a
joke
on
a
knowledgable
beer
buddy
or
to
drink
after
a
root
canal
when
you
cant
taste
anyway
now
i
will
have
to
work
an
extra
43
seconds
tomorrow
to
earn
my
1
09
i
spent
on
this
punto
this
beer
poured
the
standard
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
head
that
went
away
rather
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
corn
rotting
vegetables
and
alcohol
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
a
mixture
of
strong
alcohol
and
sweetness
that
is
very
unappealing
why
did
i
waste
1
19
on
this
stuff
it
ended
up
going
down
the
drain
after
3
or
4
swallows
consequently
i
think
this
beer
belongs
in
the
malt
liquor
category
due
to
its
strength
and
its
intended
consumer
the
artwork
on
the
can
is
clearly
reaching
out
to
people
who
drink
beer
out
of
a
paper
bag
24
ounce
master
cylinder
1
99
at
peace
street
market
this
beer
has
awful
written
all
over
it
however
there
is
a
little
piece
of
me
that
keeps
me
coming
back
that
is
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
so
strong10abv
and
one
hardly
notices
that
keep
drinking
this
baby
because
you
literally
get
your
best
bang
for
your
buck
this
is
an
all
corn
high
alcohol
lowhopped
yellow
beer
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
the
only
good
thing
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
goes
straight
down
hill
from
here
it
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
head
of
foam
on
it
a
slight
sweet
corn
smell
with
a
strong
alcohol
background
i
didnt
know
a
smell
could
burn
my
nose
until
i
got
a
whiff
of
this
stuff
the
taste
was
that
of
cough
syrup
so
if
you
have
a
bad
cold
drink
this
stuff
and
go
to
sleep
the
only
mouthfeel
is
strong
alcohol
i
didnt
expect
much
from
a
cheap
beer
if
your
in
the
mood
for
a
cheap
alternative
to
cough
syrup
and
looking
to
get
drunk
then
by
all
means
drink
this
swill
not
a
particularly
good
beer
pours
a
medium
straw
color
with
medium
carbonation
fair
head
retention
and
legs
aromas
of
fruity
pebbles
and
cream
corn
all
rolled
in
together
flavor
is
only
slightly
better
high
concentrations
of
corn
sugar
to
acheive
the
10
alcohol
also
has
other
cereal
grains
mild
sweetness
is
covered
by
big
vegetable
grain
and
fusal
alcohol
flavors
not
particularly
complex
or
balanced
an
oxidized
hop
aroma
similar
to
skunkiness
also
comes
through
in
the
flavor
body
is
nearly
syrupy
and
slick
aftertaste
is
alcoholic
and
heated
thanks
for
bring
the
cool
looking
can
not
the
beer
back
from
your
trip
to
wisconsin
this
just
came
out
in
40
oz
bottles
down
here
so
last
night
i
took
the
ride
my
nickname
for
drinking
evil
eye
still
the
dark
gold
color
with
minimal
head
as
the
can
was
smell
is
as
skunky
and
as
sickly
sweet
and
adjuncty
as
the
canned
version
taste
is
absolutely
aweful
makes
my
skin
crawl
after
each
sip
just
too
much
corny
sweetness
and
skunky
off
flavors
yuck
this
is
like
an
oddity
of
a
beer
something
so
vile
and
nasty
that
its
almost
like
running
the
gauntlet
if
you
survive
you
probably
wont
want
to
drink
this
again
thirdworld
thirdclass
gutter
swill
good
crack
nice
appearance
thats
where
the
positives
on
this
one
run
short
fuselalcohol
smells
are
apparent
as
soon
as
you
open
this
shit
smells
like
cheap
its
pretty
poundable
though
very
very
bad
tasting
i
would
wager
that
0
1
or
less
of
the
population
could
actually
finish
a
40
of
this
shit
i
got
through
half
im
not
ashamed
to
say
i
was
enjoying
the
strange
buzz
it
provided
but
my
stomach
was
not
feeling
this
one
at
all
if
the
brewmaster
of
melanie
brewing
was
here
right
now
id
whack
him
across
the
eyes
with
a
bo
staff
this
beer
pours
a
golden
brown
and
forms
about
two
fingers
worth
of
head
it
smells
kind
of
vinegarish
hard
to
nail
down
what
it
smells
like
other
than
bad
the
taste
is
worse
than
the
smell
believe
it
or
not
i
really
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
kind
of
like
rancid
pickles
possibly
i
tried
to
determine
the
mouthfeel
but
leaving
it
in
my
mouth
for
extended
periods
made
me
want
to
gag
kinda
reminds
me
of
transmission
fluid
i
really
dont
think
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
unless
maybe
if
you
could
shotgun
it
or
something
this
stuff
is
a
tonsillectomy
looking
for
a
place
to
happen
or
a
do
it
yourself
home
lobotomy
kit
rjt
uh
drink
it
cold
it
obviously
is
created
to
get
you
crunk
cause
it
is
a
cinch
to
slam
and
not
savor
which
in
a
strange
way
makes
it
kind
of
drinkable
whoa
i
think
i
am
gonna
have
my
beer
geekdom
revoked
i
got
a
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
out
of
my
pour
with
low
retention
settling
into
wisps
color
was
a
light
lemonyyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
the
same
fusel
alcoholbubblegum
quality
that
has
been
noted
in
many
like
beers
let
us
call
it
like
it
is
this
is
cheap
massproduced
swill
intended
for
an
audience
whose
sole
purpose
in
drinking
this
is
not
for
enjoyment
but
instead
to
get
as
banged
up
as
cheaply
and
as
quickly
as
possible
mouthfeel
was
very
thin
with
a
raspberrycandy
like
taste
on
the
tongue
that
was
totally
unexpected
and
nearly
caused
me
to
gag
ok
i
just
made
a
deal
with
myself
i
will
drink
half
of
the
can
to
give
it
a
fair
shake
but
the
rest
of
it
goes
in
fact
i
am
doing
a
drainpour
right
now
of
everything
not
in
my
glass
at
the
moment
so
that
i
will
not
even
be
tempted
to
finish
it
finish
was
breathtaking
and
not
in
any
good
way
my
chest
hurts
i
can
feel
the
sugar
leeching
the
water
out
of
my
brain
on
my
way
to
a
worldclass
hangover
and
my
asthma
is
kicking
oof
shame
on
whomever
made
this
for
public
sale
conclusion
it
might
be
fun
to
show
off
at
a
party
or
if
you
are
feeling
the
need
for
a
quick
drunk
undoubtedly
this
stuff
will
cause
a
nasty
hangover
in
quantity
open
can
of
this
only
in
case
of
emergency
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
bit
malty
taste
is
yuck
nothing
but
alcohol
i
would
have
been
better
served
pouring
this
into
a
shot
glass
feels
light
and
yucky
in
the
mouth
i
really
struggled
to
finish
this
can
overall
a
poor
excuse
for
a
beer
if
you
want
to
get
messed
up
drink
two
of
these
otherwise
steer
clear
of
this
malt
liquor
pale
golden
with
a
small
pure
white
head
that
quickly
shrinks
away
the
smell
is
very
solvent
like
grain
alcohol
with
a
sweet
caramelized
onion
smell
this
shit
is
just
bad
metallic
and
way
to
hot
with
a
sweet
vegetal
note
that
makes
it
unpalatable
this
is
the
worst
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
a
drain
pour
pretty
dry
finish
and
candy
alcohol
in
the
finish
as
well
overall
sweet
and
alcoholic
if
i
was
really
desperate
i
may
have
this
by
all
means
spend
your
money
elsewhere
pours
a
very
clear
corn
husk
yellow
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
fair
amount
given
the
alcohol
content
fruity
esters
sweet
dominate
the
nose
perhaps
its
low
expectations
but
the
taste
wasnt
that
bad
clean
and
not
as
buttery
as
i
am
used
to
in
my
malt
liquor
travels
but
fruity
in
flavor
and
slightly
buttery
in
texture
and
a
very
mild
carbonation
body
is
heavy
with
sweetness
but
not
quite
cloying
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
ive
had
but
not
something
i
want
to
encounter
ever
again
in
my
life
once
is
more
than
enough
well
its
a
struggle
to
know
where
to
begin
gotta
love
a
can
that
tags
itself
pours
like
a
beer
syrup
with
little
head
that
looks
infected
little
deposits
of
bubbles
at
nucleation
sites
aroma
of
corn
and
cider
hops
like
they
ran
past
the
mashtun
with
a
hop
cone
at
some
point
in
the
process
medicinal
and
alcoholic
taste
is
just
as
bad
somehow
i
think
of
duvel
what
that
is
this
is
the
opposite
no
sublety
or
grace
or
balance
but
oddly
enough
no
worse
to
drink
than
the
pbr
i
had
last
night
theres
something
compelling
about
the
big
bruising
flavor
like
a
big
dumb
drunk
that
you
enjoy
listening
to
at
the
bar
only
because
hes
not
picking
on
you
and
youre
sure
hes
bound
to
pass
out
soon
drinkability
i
finished
the
24
of
40
quite
easily
once
i
got
past
the
first
8
oz
of
it
the
beers
feel
mellowed
out
once
exposed
to
air
the
price
wasnt
right
1
55
plus
tax
but
that
notwithstanding
this
is
an
adequate
malt
liquor
for
well
atlantic
city
40
ounces
can
courtesy
of
unclemattie
poured
a
golden
color
beer
with
a
nice
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
surprisingly
aroma
of
fruity
ester
with
some
alcoholic
phenols
taste
is
not
as
bad
as
expected
with
some
subtle
adjunct
and
some
fruit
ester
the
alcohol
is
really
noticeable
and
i
guess
can
be
expected
from
a
10
malt
liquor
medium
body
with
some
good
carbonation
this
was
definitely
not
as
bad
as
expected
but
not
something
i
would
go
for
again
thought
drinkability
ugh
i
really
disliked
it
thats
just
the
way
i
roll
baby
poured
from
a
24oz
can
a
crystal
clear
straw
colour
with
a
big
pillowy
white
head
looked
halfway
decent
but
thats
where
it
stopped
smell
is
huge
corn
adjunct
youre
stunned
i
know
and
thats
about
it
taste
is
huge
corn
adjunct
as
well
with
a
pretty
big
metallic
element
in
the
taste
mouthfeel
greatly
lacks
carbonation
and
is
rather
bland
and
lifeless
neither
this
beer
nor
this
style
are
for
me
but
i
figured
id
give
it
a
go
the
only
good
thing
i
have
to
say
about
this
is
that
it
does
a
fantastic
job
of
concealing
the
100abv
my
search
for
decent
cheapos
continues
definitely
not
a
winner
here
this
it
just
cheap
crap
period
end
of
story
four
o
with
a
classic
label
on
this
clear
forty
ounce
bottle
with
cop
cars
lights
flashing
of
course
and
the
slogan
street
legal
wow
appears
like
apple
juice
golden
tone
with
a
large
white
heavily
carbonated
quickly
dwindling
head
leaves
some
lacing
around
my
glass
aroma
is
heavy
on
cooked
veggie
scent
with
some
tart
apple
phenols
approaching
the
ol
schnause
alcohol
is
noticeable
comes
off
sweet
overall
with
no
hop
aromatics
sorry
folks
taste
is
cloying
sweetness
flaked
corn
and
rice
presence
is
off
setting
some
fruity
tones
after
fermenting
it
out
to
10
abv
damn
its
rough
though
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
as
it
warms
im
not
enjoying
this
stuff
body
is
medium
to
light
drinkability
a
novelty
beer
enjoy
it
while
your
in
college
i
did
i
dont
recommend
drinking
most
of
the
can
while
reviewing
though
because
my
brain
is
in
neutral
and
my
fingers
are
so
numb
that
im
having
a
hard
time
feeling
the
keys
overall
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
in
fact
its
kind
of
the
poster
child
for
what
people
think
malt
liquor
tastes
like
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
now
go
find
them
overall
not
my
type
of
beer
but
not
bad
for
the
style
i
had
to
try
it
it
was
cheap
as
dirt
i
hope
my
sink
doesnt
mind
a
few
ounces
i
do
not
recommend
stay
away
d
so
far
of
the
malt
beverages
ive
tried
this
is
the
worst
on
the
positive
side
if
you
are
looking
to
get
blind
stupid
drunk
you
could
ask
for
a
better
beer
two
of
these
would
do
it
but
you
would
really
be
better
off
buying
some
cheap
wine
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
you
would
use
a
brown
paper
back
instead
of
a
coozy
i
may
finish
half
of
the
glass
i
poured
but
the
rest
of
the
glass
and
the
can
is
going
to
be
poured
down
the
drain
i
dont
think
the
brewer
was
aiming
to
win
any
medals
on
this
one
but
just
something
cheap
that
you
could
get
a
buzz
from
and
with
this
the
brewer
has
succeeded
its
not
as
smooth
as
old
english
but
it
is
almost
there
and
has
a
higher
alcvol
if
you
are
choosing
something
that
is
cheap
and
will
get
you
drunk
i
recommend
this
if
you
are
looking
for
a
quality
beer
experience
then
obviously
this
is
not
a
good
choice
correction
on
the
abv
this
is
9
9
abv
unless
they
are
selling
the
pictured
12
abv
somewhere
else
in
the
country
im
always
excited
to
try
the
next
horrible
malt
liquor
release
im
guessing
this
will
get
the
strawberrita
flavor
out
of
my
mouth
appears
the
color
of
apple
juice
faint
white
head
smells
a
bit
like
peanuts
and
geriatric
farts
with
a
metallic
twang
guess
what
this
beer
is
going
to
go
over
big
with
the
college
kids
under
two
bucks
and
they
will
temporarily
lose
their
vision
my
god
what
is
that
stuff
lord
help
the
beer
industry
why
is
this
swill
acceptable
theres
dead
mexicans
and
unicorn
tears
in
this
beer
at
least
thats
what
the
label
screams
with
the
font
with
depicted
unicorn
wings
taking
you
to
heaven
when
you
have
your
first
near
death
experience
going
head
to
head
with
your
frat
brothers
with
this
beer
in
a
beer
pong
tournament
alright
can
we
finally
sue
somebody
for
false
advertisement
i
give
coors
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
im
sure
they
really
frost
brew
their
products
especially
if
these
guys
are
able
to
label
it
as
a
smooth
lager
unless
smooth
is
a
contraction
as
in
this
lager
will
make
you
say
someone
im
missing
a
tooth
smooth
because
the
people
of
west
virginia
my
hometown
state
a
championing
a
beer
that
will
help
them
loos
smore
teeth
i
cant
even
take
another
sip
okay
for
the
review
and
the
fine
people
of
west
by
god
virginia
here
it
goes
rancid
flavors
that
are
making
me
poetic
i
will
finish
by
saying
this
apple
juice
looking
malt
liquor
will
rot
some
more
teeth
out
it
will
definitely
smooth
you
mouthfeel
is
similar
to
sever
acid
reflux
that
never
goes
away
not
typical
gerd
which
is
caused
by
food
and
drink
we
expose
ourselves
to
this
is
gut
wrenching
stomach
acid
like
on
the
palate
that
feeling
after
youve
puked
in
your
mouth
but
caught
it
just
in
time
overall
i
think
ive
lead
you
to
my
overall
impression
of
this
fine
canned
24
ounce
smooth
lager
with
9
9
alcohol
by
volume
drain
pouriii
i
actually
liked
this
beer
it
is
nice
and
thick
and
heavy
this
stuff
gets
you
messed
up
fast10
abv
so
be
careful
of
driving
after
drinking
a
can
i
paid
1
69
for
a
can24oz
just
to
try
it
and
it
was
worth
every
penny
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
bad
reviews
elsewhere
about
this
beer
but
hey
it
is
beer
and
a
lager
at
that
so
what
do
you
want
in
my
opinion
you
cant
get
a
better
beer
for
the
money
you
may
be
able
to
find
better
beer
but
not
at
1
69
for
a
24oz
can
cheers
this
is
not
designed
to
be
a
high
priced
flavored
beer
this
is
a
beer
designed
to
be
an
affordable
way
to
catch
a
buzz
keep
that
in
mind
avoid
at
all
costs
man
this
is
really
bad
just
a
vehicle
to
deliver
12
straight
to
the
dome
id
rather
pay
8
more
dollars
for
a
bottle
of
a
really
satisfying
12
beer
and
enjoy
it
but
then
again
the
two
worlds
in
which
these
occur
hardly
ever
meet
overall
this
beer
has
one
purpose
get
you
drunk
for
cheap
it
is
described
as
a
smooth
lager
maybe
of
your
idea
of
smooth
is
like
a
thumbtack
on
the
bottom
of
your
foot
salud
tastes
like
cheap
wine
grainy
apple
cheap
booze
numbing
alcohol
deadens
the
palate
after
a
couple
sips
gassy
sweet
and
astringent
harsh
and
unpleasant
to
say
the
least
green
apple
aftertaste
dries
out
the
mouth
like
a
shot
of
liquor
with
a
similar
boozy
aftertaste
a
messy
and
harsh
cheap
buzz
not
worth
the
headache
that
starts
in
almost
immediately
after
a
few
sips
d
i
was
actually
a
bit
pissed
off
when
jason
poured
out
the
can
remnants
before
i
could
refill
my
glass
although
in
retrospect
he
was
probably
doing
me
a
favor
still
for
a
12
highgravity
lager
this
one
cant
be
beat
shockingly
drinkable
and
inoffensive
gonna
have
to
seek
this
one
out
again
to
share
with
the
bas
who
missed
out
the
taste
is
a
huge
improvement
so
im
going
to
alter
my
scores
accordingly
it
still
has
some
of
the
characteristics
it
previously
had
like
the
thinness
and
primarily
sugaralcohol
taste
but
the
green
apples
are
mostly
gone
replaced
with
corn
as
the
smell
suggested
its
still
a
bit
green
apply
but
nothing
like
the
12
version
it
still
leaves
your
mouth
sorta
dry
as
another
reviewer
mentioned
they
basically
just
took
it
down
a
notch
tastes
more
like
a
typical
hg
malt
liquor
and
a
little
less
like
wtf
id
have
to
say
its
decent
for
what
it
is
i
may
even
buy
it
again
if
i
get
sick
of
natty
daddy
o
well
ill
be
picked
it
up
on
a
whim
to
see
how
bad
it
is
and
it
turns
out
not
to
be
honestly
i
can
see
myself
buying
this
again
drinks
more
like
a
strong
dopplebock
than
a
malt
liquor
although
the
appearance
wouldnt
tell
you
that
taste
is
very
sweet
and
very
much
like
a
granny
smith
apple
that
has
bobbed
around
in
a
trashcan
punch
concoction
in
the
backyard
of
a
college
frat
house
for
a
few
months
are
we
sure
there
are
no
fruit
flavored
adjuncts
here
i
must
say
it
is
somewhat
smoother
than
i
anticipated
for
a
12er
but
damn
this
tastes
like
an
asian
nail
salon
that
doubles
as
a
cider
factory
i
think
i
will
go
for
the
under
on
8
oz
its
pretty
nasty
and
not
very
beerlike
i
might
attempt
to
sip
on
this
for
a
bit
longer
but
damn
this
shit
is
rizank
3292014
update
new
cans
are
rated
9
9
abv
and
the
brew
is
much
more
tolerable
actually
not
bad
at
all
now
i
went
out
on
a
limb
and
picked
up
a
few
cans
of
this
stuff
to
share
with
some
buddies
i
thought
it
was
some
kind
of
alcoholic
energy
drink
at
first
it
does
not
look
like
beer
from
the
outside
upon
further
inspection
i
realized
it
was
indeed
beer
or
should
i
say
supposedly
beer
12
abv
at
that
i
figured
it
couldnt
be
any
worse
than
some
of
the
40s
ive
had
in
my
day
so
id
give
it
a
shot
kind
of
as
a
novelty
before
we
cracked
them
i
said
the
words
that
sealed
my
fate
how
bad
can
it
be
this
angered
the
beer
gods
and
i
was
quickly
reminded
by
my
friend
not
to
make
such
inflammatory
remarks
in
short
the
beer
gods
rose
to
the
occasion
and
made
this
quite
possibly
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
hell
it
might
be
the
worst
edible
substance
ive
ever
put
in
my
mouth
its
like
shitty
moonshine
mixed
with
battery
acid
and
cut
with
club
soda
or
more
likely
an
abortion
of
an
energy
drink
topped
off
with
grain
alcohol
every
sip
made
me
cringe
and
cough
if
im
being
nice
the
best
i
can
say
is
that
it
tasted
like
rusty
champagne
but
dont
let
that
fool
you
youd
rather
drink
whatever
a
bartender
wrings
out
of
his
towel
at
the
end
of
the
night
than
take
on
the
stack
it
has
a
very
unique
flavor
of
froot
loops
and
vomit
the
feeling
you
get
when
you
drink
it
makes
you
question
if
life
is
even
worth
living
it
feels
horrible
going
down
and
leaves
your
stomach
howling
upon
contact
you
will
need
to
drink
a
quart
of
listerine
after
this
and
not
the
nice
minty
green
one
im
talking
the
old
school
yellow
one
where
antiseptic
is
actually
the
flavor
stay
away
from
this
at
all
costs
or
if
you
think
youre
up
to
the
task
drink
a
whole
can
and
you
will
have
such
an
extreme
point
of
relativity
that
everything
else
you
ever
eat
or
drink
will
seem
like
the
most
awesomely
delicious
thing
youve
ever
tasted
summary
i
wouldnt
dont
know
where
else
to
take
that
so
ill
leave
it
there
i
wouldnt
ill
be
honest
i
had
to
force
this
one
down
its
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
d
if
you
can
swallow
it
pretty
much
gives
what
you
would
expect
cheap
ethanol
delivery
device
wth
too
sweet
of
a
taste
not
going
to
finish
the
glass
though
from
the
24
fl
oz

sampled

2010
this
craft
malt
liquor
pours
a
goldenyellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dissolves
to
a
thin
ring
like
the
macro
malt
liquors
on
the
market
this
one
bursts
with
the
aroma
of
barley
grains
and
malt
the
taste
adheres
to
the
malt
liquor
style
with
an
explosion
of
barley
malts
immersed
in
an
obvious
alcohol
casing
but
there
is
a
slight
sweetness
that
accompanies
the
sour
not
my
kind
of
thing
but
hats
off
to
the
brewer
for
emulating
the
malt
liquor
tradition
overall
wow
im
half
shitfaced
and
im
a
professional
alcoholic
so
glad
i
didnt
buy
two
as
the
demon
on
my
left
shoulder
suggested
the
demon
on
my
right
shoulder
wouldnt
even
look
at
this
shit
avoid
like
aids
d
low
even
for
the
style
i
wouldnt
wish
this
on
my
worst
enemies
stay
away
d
just
a
few
sips
it
all
i
can
muster
to
just
type
this
up
this
will
probably
be
the
last
malt
liquor
for
me
for
awhile
to
be
honest
i
was
seriously
mistaken
in
this
purchase
since
i
bought
it
at
a
store
that
sold
highend
beer
at
the
same
time
i
made
a
purchase
of
some
chimay
ale
i
assumed
that
it
was
a
quality
product
in
a
funky
package
you
know
how
some
companies
push
the
edge
i
really
dont
look
at
price
when
i
purchase
individual
bottles
for
tastings
but
i
was
amazed
that
the
stack
high
gravity
lager
was
one
of
the
inexpensive
ones
the
cashier
pointed
out
the
high
alcohol
content
i
dismissed
it
having
recently
read
about
brewdogs
greatly
expensive
highest
alcohol
content
beers
in
wired
magazine
and
seen
their
utoooob
videos
touting
how
they
froze
and
extracted
the
beer
to
concentrate
the
alcohol
and
flavor
sink
the
bismark
now
admittedly
i
had
the
chimay
first
because
i
am
somewhat
enamored
by
those
belgian
monks
and
their
ales
and
cheeses
and
this
may
have
affected
my
taste
buds
somewhat
however
while
the
stack
is
somewhat
weaker
in
flavor
a
ciderlike
poor
cousin
character
and
significantly
thinner
in
appearance
than
the
chimay
red
i
found
it
strangely
acceptable
as
with
any
beer
above
5
abv
one
begins
to
note
the
strong
aroma
and
characteristics
of
a
high
alcohol
brew
would
i
like
it
as
a
stand
alone
perhaps
not
would
i
have
it
again
perhaps
not
however
i
find
that
the
fs
and
ds
offered
up
by
the
ba
community
are
also
applied
to
some
magnificent
brews
yuengling
lord
chesterfield
ale
for
instance
give
it
a
chance
in
fact
if
served
to
your
friends
after
some
fine
chimay
grand
reserve
or
red
ale
they
might
not
notice
you
paid
next
to
nothing
for
the
24
ouncer
it
is
what
it
is
seriously
i
try
to
be
objective
ive
drank
my
fair
share
of
malt
liquor
and
this
one
started
out
average
but
hit
the
floor
its
like
organic
chemistry
in
a
can
i
keep
waiting
for
that
hot
lab
ta
i
had
to
kick
open
my
door
and
make
sure
i
put
on
safety
goggles
while
drinking
this
and
then
you
know
make
out
with
me
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
wheat
pickles
trash
and
citrus
the
flavor
is
citrus
wheat
and
alcohol
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
better
than
earthquake
but
that
is
not
saying
much
pours
very
deep
golden
color
with
a
large
head
and
retention
is
somewhat
good
for
this
type
of
brew
nose
is
toxicchemical
and
sickeningly
sweet
sour
like
artificial
sour
green
apple
a
lot
of
alcohol
heat
on
the
backend
mouthfeel
is
watery
cloyingly
sweet
this
tastes
more
like
a
badly
put
together
barleywine
or
perhaps
what
i
envision
the
wine
they
make
in
prison
tastes
white
grape
juice
comes
to
mind
i
drank
a
lot
of
crap
beer
growing
up
but
this
is
possibly
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
i
bought
it
as
a
gag
and
thats
what
i
got
and
then
some
rjt
this
stuff
is
in
a
class
of
its
own
and
i
think
it
is
fantastic
for
a
low
priced
and
highly
alcoholic
beverage
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
rank
with
pears
to
a
cloying
extent
and
with
a
spicy
bready
finish
now
this
is
quite
sweet
and
not
appealing
but
it
is
not
as
awful
as
a
12
malt
liquor
by
all
accounts
should
be
in
this
respect
this
is
actually
quite
a
good
malt
liquor
the
body
is
medium
to
full
with
a
high
amount
of
carbonation
id
prefer
less
carbonation
as
if
you
are
drinking
this
beer
it
impedes
the
shotgunning
capability
i
most
likely
wont
be
sampling
this
beverage
again
but
if
i
was
broke
and
wanted
some
malt
liquor
well
this
is
an
adequate
choice
im
not
saying
this
tastes
good
but
for
a
12
malt
liquor
it
tastes
better
than
it
should
d
this
is
easily
the
best
malt
liquor
that
ive
had
while
it
is
very
sweet
i
found
it
to
be
lacking
in
the
usually
bad
traits
of
malt
liquors
if
youre
ballin
on
a
budget
this
one
might
be
for
you
whoa
hoss
i
could
smell
this
bad
boy
as
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
green
apples
all
the
way
phew
i
did
not
get
much
head
off
of
the
pour
and
what
existed
quickly
reduced
to
wisps
props
on
color
though
it
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
hot
i
could
feel
the
alcohol
burn
on
my
tongue
and
when
i
swallowed
it
felt
cool
from
the
evaporation
man
they
really
jacked
up
the
alcohol
on
this
bad
boy
finish
was
lingering
with
an
alcohol
burn
there
is
no
way
i
could
justify
recommending
this
as
a
beer
except
to
add
another
casualty
to
the
canquest
im
sorry
to
come
out
and
just
bash
a
beer
but
i
figured
as
long
as
i
was
subjecting
myself
to
this
beer
i
would
write
a
review
it
just
really
is
that
bad
drinkable
as
in
you
can
swallow
it
pretty
much
gives
what
you
would
expect
cheap
ethanol
delivery
device
not
going
to
finish
the
glass
though
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mostly
of
alcohol
some
malts
and
slightly
sweet
taste
starts
of
sweet
and
finishes
with
alcohol
did
someone
drop
a
shot
in
my
beer
feels
light
in
the
mouth
this
is
definatly
not
a
session
beer
1
of
these
cans
was
plenty
for
me
overall
if
you
are
looking
to
get
slam
faced
cheap
this
one
is
the
way
to
go
otherwise
avoid
it
not
very
experienced
in
the
malt
liquor
region
but
its
better
than
some
ive
had
definitely
hot
but
at
least
the
esters
arent
offputting
and
there
is
some
malt
backbone
this
is
a
really
great
malt
liquor
id
heard
of
it
and
picked
some
up
when
i
was
in
massachusetts
i
had
no
idea
it
was
actually
made
in
mass
at
the
time
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
ive
ever
had
its
been
sitting
in
my
fridge
for
months
too
so
it
may
have
been
ever
better
fresh
i
dont
think
i
like
it
quite
as
much
as
olde
english
but
it
would
definitely
be
absolutely
perfect
if
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
less
sweet
than
an
oe
this
has
a
lot
of
similarities
to
it
the
unmasked
corn
flavour
and
muskiness
are
both
there
and
it
has
a
very
pleasant
old
man
beer
flavour
to
it
its
just
a
little
drier
than
most
malt
liquors
theres
definitely
some
hops
in
there
providing
a
little
bit
of
balancing
bitterness
and
while
there
is
sweetness
it
is
more
in
the
background
and
not
as
inyourface
as
in
a
lot
of
malt
liquors
if
youre
looking
for
something
in
a
40
oz
bottle
this
is
an
excellent
way
to
go
its
almost
too
good
to
be
marketed
that
way
almost
the
one
poster
who
stated
this
was
the
king
the
elite
of
malt
liquors
was
right
at
that
time
we
drunk
it
from
green
bottles
often
a
bit
skunky
tasting
something
like
heineken
but
with
an
alcohol
kick
to
it
my
dormmates
and
i
always
had
cases
of
this
stashed
for
parties
and
beer
busts
and
of
course
the
parties
had
predictable
results
people
passed
out
and
strewn
about
on
the
floor
fights
breaking
out
students
running
through
boston
naked
at
500am
and
jumping
into
the
toxic
charles
river
for
a
swim
students
disappeared

it
does
not
want
to
go
places
where
it
should
not
go
when
consumed
in
mass
quantities
it
feels
more
like
magic
mushroom
trip
than
an
alcohol
buzz
but
getting
back
to
taste
we
would
freeze
these
things
and
they
would
slide
down
easy
smooth
for
a
malt
liquor
and
had
a
dry
finish
even
i
have
not
seen
it
for
years
in
any
stores
this
might
be
a
regional
thing
i
will
have
to
hunt
some
down
for
old
times
sake
remember
the
little
symbol
puzzles
on
the
bottom
of
the
cap
classic
stuff
d
for
a
malt
liquor
that
isnt
made
by
a
craft
brewery
this
is
pretty
good
near
the
pinnacle
of
the
style
actually
some
might
argue
that
the
6
9
abv
is
cheating
and
that
this
should
be
in
the
adjunct
lager
category
but
the
awesome
bottle
says
otherwise
a
musttry
for
lovers
of
malt
liquor
i
think
we
actually
finished
nearly
all
40oz
at
the
party
after
the
initial
splash
was
poured
on
the
pavement
rjt

cereals

a
little
sour
note
at
the
finish
gives
this
an
old
world
feel
overall
relaxed
and
drinkable
nice
for
the
price
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
considering
that
this
beer
is
intended
to
be
an
inexpensive
way
to
get
drunk
quickly
its
not
that
bad
but
thats
all
there
is
to
any
quality
in
this
beer
good
ol
green
death
always
came
across
as
a
respected
beer
among
its

even

want
to

up
big

with
a
snap

clean
and
on
the
sweet
side
some
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
a
kiss
of
alcohol
help
to
balance
drinkable
with
a
clean
finish
a
charmer
compared
to
the
rougher
of
its
ilk
i
tried
this
out
due
to
the
price
and
decent
ratings
it
got
i
have
to
say
for
the
style
it
isnt
all
that
bad
it
wont
be
a
regular
for
me
but
ill
drink
it
again
this
tasted
a
lot
like
tatra
good
thing
i
bought
this
just
for
the
experience
no
need
to
do
that
again
man
we
had
no
taste
in
college
did
we
dang
i
poured
a
good
rocky
two
fingers
worth
of
bonewhite
head
then
i
began
typing
and
looked
away
and
by
the
time
i
looked
back
it
was
gone
in
the
interest
of
equal
time
it
did
leave
a
good
bit
of
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
i
could
read
my
next
door
neighbors
sunday
comics
nose
was
well
when
i
initially
unscrewed
the
cap
yeah
you
read
that
correctly
skunky
it
may
or
may
not
be
attributable
to
the
green
bottle
taking
a
whiff
from
the
glass
it
was
less
pronounced
than
it
had
been
following
the
pour
and
i
am
willing
to
give
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
would
they
really
use
saaz
hops
in
a
cheap
aml
taste
was
not
skunky
at
all
but
it
was
sickeningly
sweet
wow
between
yesterdays
malty
love
fest
and
this
i
may
yet
develop
adultonset
diabetes
to
go
with
my
adultonset
asthma
and
my
early
arthritis
great
the
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
sugary
sweetness
laced
with
a
mild
hoppiness
on
the
tongue
phew
man
i
would
rather
have
fusel
heat
than
sticky
sweet
but
at
least
it
is
mildly
palatable
i
have
had
some
beers
that
could
not
even
make
that
claim
finish
left
me
thankful
that
it
was
cold
and
that
i
was
not
out
in
the
alley
drinking
with
my
neighbors
d
fairly
high
i
enjoy
this
malt
liquor
and
think
its
better
from
the
can
d
probably
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
and
certainly
deserving
of
the
private
stock
emblazoned
on
the
label
i
drank
the
whole
thing
this
beer
eventually
started
to
dry
my
mouth
out
24oz
can
clear
bright
gold
with
a
thin
collar
of
white
bubbles
and
a
bit
of
slightly
sticky
lace
it
doesnt
smell
like
much
at
all
maybe
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
cereal
thats
about
it
bitterness
was
almost
nonexistent
quite
sweet
slight
cereal
and
grain
flavours
clean
overall
with
just
a
hint
of
fruitiness
in
the
finish
not
too
much
alcohol
flavour
or
warmth
either
medium
bodied
with
coarse
carbonation
that
thankfully
was
fairly
low
and
mellowed
after
about
15
minutes
overall
not
bad
its
clean
and
about
as
inoffensive
as
youre
going
to
get
from
this
style
from
the
40
ouncer
sampled
on
june
5
2010
it
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
two
inch
very
fluffy
white
head
that
takes
forever
to
settle
i
was
not
drinking
it
ice
cold
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
some
adjunct
ingredients
like
grain
corn
and
rice
notes
but
overall
it
is
not
very
enticing
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
with
a
kind
of
smooth
balance
of
malts
and
some
distant
hop
notes
but
mainly
the
taste
is
comprised
of
malts
and
adjuncts
still
it
does
not
have
that
skunkiness
often
associated
with
green
bottles
as
a
young
man
this
was
one
of
my
regular
get
drunk
beers
now
at
age
50
i
drink
it
more
for
the
memories
not
the
flavor
d
well
water
is
pretty
drinkable
and
so
is
soda
water
so
yeah
this
has
drinkability
poured
this
from
a
12
ounce
can
into
a
glass
bright
golden
color
sweet
boozy
smell
the
alcohol
is
very
apparent
and
very
relaxing
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
very
drinkable
probably
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
i
have
drank
a
great
find
indeed
i
rate
this
my
3
malt
liquor
used
to
drink
in
high
school
in
philly
before
i
moved
on
and
traded
up
to
crazy
horse
and
eventually
mickeys
from
a
16
oz
can
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malt
and
corn
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
corn
feels
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
drinkability
is
pretty
good
and
packs
a
bit
of
a
punch
overall
this
is
a
beer
is
not
bad
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
a
solid
choice
would
work
to
wash
down
hot
dogs
and
onion
rings
not
a
choice
against
other
styles
but
in
style
it
is
a
good
choice
great
for
a
cheap
night
with
one
40
drinkability
is
decent
as
far
as
straw
colored
effervescent
brews
go
this
one
falls
apart
on
the
palate
and
has
an
ultracrisp
finish
that
being
said
the
profile
is
semifresh
and
without
the
staleness
that
tends
to
plague
pale
lagers
this
is
malt
liquor
when
i
remember
drinking
this
style
it
was
olde
english
jan
29
2009
yea
for
malt
liquor
from
texas
no
less
out
of
the
bottle
this
beer
was
a
deep
golden
color
with
good
clarity
and
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
aroma
was
sourstale
corn
and
rice
mash
the
flavors
were
dry
and
grainy
with
pale
malt
and
a
light
sweetness
in
the
middle
that
became
a
little
hoppy
at
the
end
better
depth
than
expected
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
oily
the
carbonation
soft
and
the
body
medium
a
quaffable
malt
liquor
designed
to
get
you
wasted
not
a
bad
choice
if
this
was
your
goal
16oz
green
bottle
from
the
local
hannaford
pours
a
light
yellow
translucent
body
with
a
quarter
inch
or
less
of
witeish
head
cereal
grains
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
butter
cereal
grains
dominate
the
flavor
too
with
hints
of
maltiness
citrus
hops
flavor
is
very
good
for
the
style
very
light
in
body
with
ample
carbonation
makes
this
a
drinkable
brew
overall
an
extremely
solid
malt
liquor
much
better
than
others
in
the
style
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
for
the
beer
this
is
a
surpisingly
affordable
and
drinkable
beer
smokin
weed
and
bambu
sippin
on
private
stock
to
my
surprise
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
american
lager
of
course
there
is
that
adjunctladed
emptiness
where
the
meatandpotatoes
of
the
beer
should
be
but
the
beer
has
a
medium
malt
grain
balance
with
few
flaws
the
medium
straw
color
gives
a
foamstand
that
is
both
fizzy
and
replentishing
efforvescent
carbonation
gives
a
light
prickle
on
the
mouth
clear
and
bright
throughout
aromas
of
sweetness
corn
sugars
help
the
malts
but
also
gives
the
beer
an
artificial
taste
and
texture
light
on
the
vegitable
grain
and
sulfurs
for
ease
of
drinking
quite
clean
throughout
but
with
a
persistant
residual
corn
sweetness
that
detracts
from
the
malts
in
the
end
of
all
the
american
malt
liquors
this
is
my
choice
the
smell
is
not
that
bad
detect
a
bit
of
pine
smell
nothing
overbearing
since
graduating
to
ipas
and
the
like
have
not
had
too
many
malt
liquors
but
the
taste
is
probably
better
than
most
amls
not
too
thick
or
overly
alcoholic
i
will
grab
one
once
in
a
while
to
reminisce
over
my
college
years
smooth
and
winodrinkable
best
served
in
a
brown
paper
bag
in
a
van
down
by
the
river
drinkability
for
what
it
is
it
is
incredibly
drinkable
i
totally
forgot
how
good
this
stuff
was
for
a
cheap
beer
beware
on
hot
days
count
your
caps
d
i
consider
this
to
be
a
fairly
good
representation
of
the
style
actually
better
than
most
but
still
as
far
as
overall
drinkability
for
me
is
is
just
alright
d
this
stuff
is
highly
drinkable
i
recommend
it
as
long
as
its
fresh
i
cant
believe
i
found
this
were
in
auburn
al
and
the
only
place
we
found
thats
open
is
a
little
gas
station
near
our
hotel
so
we
went
in
and
on
our
first
pass
of
the
coolers
we
found
a
six
pack
of
this
ive
looked
for
this
beer
for
2
years
and
finally
found
it
pours
orange
like
watery
orangeade
and
with
a
nice
filmy
white
head
smells
apply
and
softly
of
ethanol
mellow
taste
is
supurb
for
the
style

a

goes
down
smooth

nicely
with
nothing
to
make
me
want
to
spit
it
out
you
know
of
all
the
40s
i
drank
a
few
years
ago
i
never
even
tried
this
one
not
too
bad
cheap
and
gets
the
job
done
hey
this
isnt
double
bastard
you
know
wow
was
i
surprised
i
got
a
6
pack
for
3
99
and
was
expecting
garbage
not
so
it
has
good
taste
its
smooth
and
no
aftertaste
plus
an
abv
of
6

whats
not
to
likei
would
recommened
this
beer
to
anyone
and
you
can
be
sure
i
will
buying
again
shortly
haffenreffer
private
stock
with
the
imported
taste
is
the
winner
of
malt
likkapalooza
v
although
it
was
anything
but
a
clear
victory
my
suspicion
is
that
the
extra
alcohol
and
less
overall
sweetness
secured
the
trophy
more
than
anything
else
maybe
custer
should
have
fortified
himself
with
a
40
or
two
before
the
battle

16oz

at

local
mart
in
union
pale
straw
color
as
you
would
find
with
a
beer
like
this
smells
skunky
tastes
though
not
bad
the
skunk
i
smelled
is
barely
in
the
taste
this
was
a
green
bottle
overall
it
is
a
better
than
average
malt
liquor
maybe
if
it
was
in
a
brown
bottle
it
might
be
even
better
d
i
am
thoroughly
impressed
for
a
malt
liquor
this
is
low
in
grossness
and
high
in
drinkability
if
i
am
looking
fro
forties
in
the
future
the
cheap
and
quaffable
haffenreffer
is
where
ill
turn
at
2
39
for
a
40
oz
bottle
i
think
this
has
to
be
one
of
best
malt
liquors
on
the
market
not
all
that
bad
when
price
and
drinkability
level
are
factored
in

up
for
a
barbeque

enjoy

if
you
have
a
choice
2
for
3
00
between
this
and
icehouse
edge
youre
better
off
going
with
icehouse
edge
and
thats
all
i
have
to
say
about
that
could
possibly
drink
if
there
was
nothing
else
overall
i
dont
think
i
could
place
this
either
above
or
below
standard
211
theyre
both
pretty
awful
o
overall
crafted
much
better
then
your
typical
malt
liquor
more
speciality
grain
influence
sweet
very
clean
no
noticeable
alcohol
and
offers
a
surprising
easy
drinkability
i
would
drink
this
in
a
pinch
over
any
bmc
product
and
price
per
pound
not
a
bad
choice
for
those
who
like
the
style
this
isnt
your
daddys
malt
liquor
and
is
not
bad
in
the
end
a
bit
sweet
overall
for
multiples
rated
to
style
o
i
was
actually
pretty
tupsy
after
the
one
can
may
not
taste
great
but
it
is
dirt
cheap
and
has
plenty
of
alcohol
will
buy
again
for
sure
on
nights
i
just
want
to
get
drunk
without
liquor
o
lets
realize
that
this
stuff
is
a
cheap
and
effective
way
to
introduce
alcohol
into
your
body
i
would
highly
recommend
keeping
this
stuff
as
close
to
freezing
as
possible
it
is
actually
one
of
the
better
entries
in
this
class
as
there
is
much
worse
out
there
evil
eye
or
camo
come
to
mind
after
spending
6
hours
working
outside
on
a
88
degree
day
this
stuff
isnt
too
bad
sourcing
purchased
in
austin
tx
in
november
of
2013
for
2

plus
tax
for
a
twentyfour
ounce
can
o
while
the
steel
reserve
211
high
gravity
had
some
decent
flavor
to
it
this
version
is
just
plain
awful
the
alcohol
is
not
well
hidden
and
is
reminiscent
of
jet
fuel
and
there
is
a
strange
metallic
presence
as
well
i
would
not
get
this
one
again
for
any

i
dont
know
why
others
have
been
dissing
this
onei
love
it
i
found
it
at
a
local
ingles
for
99
cents
a
canand
an
8
1
abv
it
feels
like
there
are
a
lot
of
beer
snobs
out
there
i
drink
a
lot
of
nonalcoholic
beerstoo
but
once
in
a
whileit
doesnt
hurt
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
ill
be
buying
more
of
thesedown
the
road
the
smell
is
sweet
and
not
unlike
other
malt
liquors
but
the
taste
is
unlike
anything
ive
ever
had
in
a
malt
liquor
before
im
surprised
the
reviews
arent
higher
because
this
is
clearly
an
attempt
at
changing
up
malt
liquor
for
the
beer
connoisseur
it
tastes
strongly
of
yeast
like
it
was
bottle
conditioned
or
i
guess
can
conditioned
in
this
case
it
takes
a
lot
away
from
the
sweetness
and
the
thinness
that
is
the
status
quo
in
malt
liquors
as
a
fan
of
some
malt
liquors
im
not
sure
if
i
like
this
significant
departure
but
as
a
fan
of
quads
i
enjoy
it
so
im
torn
as
to
whether
its
really
ok
for
it
to
be
somewhere
in
between
it
is
so
far
from
what
i
was
expecting
its
like
someone
tried
to
make
a
lager
into
a
quad
with
really
low
quality
ingredients
but
with
plenty
of
knowhow
nonetheless
strange
but
enjoyable
i
think
im
going
to
have
to
rate
it
pretty
highly
one
problem
is
that
its
not
as
refreshing
as
other
malt
liquors
or
as
quads
because
it
lacks
that
fruity
quality
its
just
pure
yeast
flavour
it
retains
a
bit
of
that
chemical
flavour
of
regular
steel
reserve
but
the
yeast
covers
it
up
pretty
well
weird
wild
stuff
and
definitely
quite
different
from
ordinary
silvercanned
steel
reserve
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
lots
of
carbonation
smell
is
big
on
corn
some
other
grains
maybe
hay
taste
is
corn
some
alcohol
and
grains
a
touch
of
malts
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
i
wouldnt
want
a
steady
diet
of
it
considering
the
abv
and
price
point
its
not
the
worst
malt
liquor
out
there
overall
not
a
very
good
way
to
get
a
buzz
here
the
abv
indeed
is
pretty
killer
but
choking
it
down
to
get
there
is
not
too
pleasant
there
are
easier
ways
to
accomplish
this
even
with
cheap
malt
liquors
that
being
said
this
is
one
of
the
cheapest
ive
seen
soooo
theres
that
rjt
nothing
really
special
to
report
if
you
hate
high
gravity
lagers
that
slap
you
in
the
face
dont
go
here
this
is
barely
better
than
silver
label
8
1
if
hurricane
high
gravity
is
in
your
area
id
get
that
instead
note
the
can
claims
we
believe
this
to
be
among
the
very
best
beers
in
the
world
thats
disconcerting
nothing
about
this
beer
says
share
this
with
your
friends
nothing
says
that
you
should
buy
it
for
parties
or
hand
it
out
at
family
gatherings
but
for
what
it
offers
it
delivers
if
you
need
a
buzz
and
a
bowel
movement
this
is
your
choice
for
ninetynine
cents
nothing
else
can
offer
so
much
for
so
little
d
if
not
for
the
b
o
smell
this
wouldnt
be
too
bad
but
its
just
pretty
overpowering
d
surprisingly
not
as
awful
as
i
was
anticipating
given
steel
reserves
infamous
reputation
id
still
rather
have
some
stack
or
haffenreffer
private
stock
son
i
am
disappointed
i
look
forward
to
trying
this
again
as
i
think
something
is
off
in
this
review
it
may
be
me
ive
had
this
once
before
i
remember
being
impressed
heh
from
the
can
slow
brewed
in
limited
batches
using
only
the
finest
malted
barley
selected
hops
we
believe
this
to
be
among
the
very
best
beers
in
the
world
really
do
they
also
believe
in
the
tooth
fairy
santa
claus
and
the
easter
bunny
how
about
buying
the
brooklyn
bridge
from
me
cheap
slow
brewed
for
exceptionally
smooth
flavor
zounds
d
i
gets
the
job
done
but
with
nothing
to
brag
about
i
think
this
tastes
smoother
than
the
silver
211
like
comparing
a
filtered
cigarette
to
a
lucky
strike
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
cheap
malt
liquor
this
one
will
be
at
the
top
of
my
list
pours
a
soso
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fairly
thick
but
not
persistent
white
head
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
fairly
strong
but
nothing
to
enter
on
your
blog
flavor
is
malty
and
crisp
slightly
sour
slightly
sweet
texture
is
smooth
a
little
on
the
watery
side
just
a
bit
tingly
not
too
shabby
but
i
doubt
ill
be
seeking
this
one
out
drinkability
does
drinkability
mean
pouring
the
beer
into
a
big
funnel
attached
to
a
hose
that
is
pointing
into
your
mouth
thats
about
the
only
way
id
ever
want
to
have
one
of
these
again
just
get
it
past
my
taste
buds
as
quickly
as
possible
before
they
are
somehow
damaged
by
this
beer
its
a
good
thing
that
this
brew
is
high
in
alcohol
content
and
comes
in
a
big
can
that
can
be
downed
quickly
for
a
good
buzz
because
it
certainly
isnt
a
sipper
and
letting
it
warm
ever
so
slightly
brings
its
horrid
fusels
to
the
foreground
everything
about
this
beer
is
laughable
from
a
true
appreciator
of
beer
as
the
company
titles
it
triple
export
as
if
it
has
some
high
status
as
an

man
but
as
i
finished
the
24oz
can
got
tattooed
up
after
a
few
of
these
what
dreams
are
made
of
o
a
lot
better
than
i
though
this
brew
gets
a
bad
rep
in
my
opinion
i
just
saw
this
in
the
store
today
came
home
read
reviews
here
wnet
back
and
bought
a
12
pack
its
the
6abv
versioni
was
hoping
for
8
i
gave
it
a
4
on
looks
simple
because
i
like
darker
colored
beers
a
4
on
smell
because
it
didnt
smell
like
corn
to
me
it
gets
a
5
for
taste
i
really
like
the
taste
my
first
impression
was
a
fruity
flavor
then
it
went
to
a
malty
taste
i
did
not
find
it
bitter
at
all
but
thats
because
i
drink
irish
beer
regularly
it
did
not
remind
me
of
malt
liquor
at
all
i
gave
it
a
2
for
feel
it
was
very
watery
to
me
over
all
i
rate
it
a
4
because
of
the
color
the
lady
at
the
package
store
told
me
that
stuff
is
evil
lmao
will
i
buy
this
again
yes
i
will
it
taste
very
good
with
a
bowl
of
chili
they
paired
up
wonderfully
i
have
a
strong
feeling
this
should
be
used
in
moderation
i
have
a
hunch
a
night
of
hitting
this
heavey
will
kick
yer
ass
the
next
day
just
saying
if
you
dont
like
bitter
beers
or
prefer
pale
brews
this
wont
change
your
mind
if
you
already
like
better
ales
give
it
a
shot
overall
people
who
seek
malt
liquor
should
try
steel
reserve
211
high
gravity
keep
in
mind
that
my
rating
of
this
beer
is
relative
obviously
steel
reserve
cant
be
compared
to
a
topoftheline
ipa
that
being
said
for
malt
liquor
steel
reserve
is
one
of
my
favorites
granted
i
only
drink
it
when
the
bank
account
has
more
dust
in
it
than
dollars
but
i
must
admit
that
it
does
have
qualities
that
i
enjoy
for
starters
it
has
a
nice
light
amber
color
and
bubbles
like
a
champagne
the
taste
is
fairly
clean
and
crisp
for
a
malt
and
the
aftertaste
is
not
bad
at
all
this
one
will
give
you
a
nasty
hangover
though
if
you
drink
too
much
of
it
enjoyed
best
while
still
ice
cold
well
this
is
the
beer
to
get
if
you
like
your
malt
liquor
potent
and
who
wouldnt
it
really
is
drinkable
though
and
doesnt
get
all
flat
and
skunky
faster
than
you
can
drink
it
like
other
malt
liquors
in
40
oz
form
i
dont
know
in
a
pinch
i
would
take
this
over
some
really
crappy
socalled
craft
beers
put
it
that
way
but
its
malt
liquor
and
you
know
what
the
score
is
its
an
apples
and
oranges
test
if
you
compare
steel
reserve
to
highly
delicate
crafted
micro
brews
in
fact
its
insulting
to
make
the
comparison
in
the
first
place
however
having
said
that
and
after
taking
another
glorious
gulp
of
my
24
oz
steel
reserve
its
a
great
beer
if
you
just
rate
itself
and
forget
all
the
other
legends
for
starters
its
a
acquired
taste
of
strong
and
bold
rich
barely
sweet
and
bitter
all
at
the
same
time
the
after
taste
is
also
need
of
acquiring
luckily
i
have
acquired
all
of
the
above
price
point
is
unbeatable
for
1
50
not
too
shabby
you
wont
go
bankrupt
with
this
financial
decision
the
high
alcohol
content
of
8
1
is
mind
blowing
you
wont
get
that
same
effect
with
say
coors
light
or
bud
ive
coined
the
nickname
a
quick
cheap
drunk
p
best
way
to
drink
this
like
almost
all
good
beers
ice
cold
its
a
mans
beer
my
girlfriend
doesnt
understand
why
i
love
it
so
much
even
though
she
likes
drinking
some
of
the
worst
hard
alcohol
on
the

the

does
smell

you

there
is

it

has

this

i
also
cant

cost
me
3

for
two
of
these
ginormous

and
hides

very

its
strange
coming
back
to
this

so
many
of
these
downed
by
friends
and
i
back
in
the
day
we
never
stopped
to
think
about
what
we
were
actually
drinking
as
a
refreshing
drink
with
minimal
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
kinda
sweet
the
moderate
presence
of
hops
in
the
flavor
keep
it
from
becoming
sickly
sweet
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
actually
fairly
decent
for
a
malt
liquor
owing
to
its
smoothness
going
down
the
presence
of
alcohol
is
fairly
strong

both

you

before
it

steel

is
better
than
most
overall
im
glad
such
a
low

even
exists
at

local

sixers

go
for

chug

and
lets
get
to
the
point
it
gets
you
fing
smashed
doesnt
taste
any
worst
coming
back
up
upon
further
review
and
repeated
drinking
this
is
better
than
i
initially
gave
it
credit
for
i
feel
like
regular
purchases
have
earned
this
a
better
drinkability
score
i
like
steel
reserve
poured
from
a
24
ounce
can
with
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottom
april
2010
hell
yeah
this
is
fresh
poured
into
a
pint
glass
with
about
1
5
inches
of
head
i
can
smell
corn
rice
and
other
almost
acidic
scents
lots
of
corn
and
sweetness
in
the
flavor
oh
yeah
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
well
but
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
malt
liguors
crack
a
40
turn
up
some
heavy
metal
and
cheap
pizza
and
rock
out
drinkability
bad
it
tastes
bad
so
its
difficult
to
drink
the
label
claims
things
like
twice
the
hops
and
malts
as
many
normal
lagers
but
i
cant
taste
them
the
only
good
thing
about
getting
a
case
of
steel
reserve
is
that
i
now
have
a
recyclable
container
the
box
in
which
i
can
put
my
paper
recycling
the
canned
version
is
pretty
bad
as
well
not
that
i
was
expecing
the
whole
beer
to
change
but
at
least
it
doesnt
smell
or
taste
like
two
hundred
percent
skunked
garbage
unlike
the
bottled
notes
this
beer
straddles
the
line
between
light
lager
and
adjunct
lager
as
far
as
rating
the
categories
goes
it
looks
like
a
light
lager
but
tates
like
a
full
bodied
lager
along
the
lines
of
a
budweiser
so
that
is
how
i
rated
it
i
would
rather
have
a
bud
if
i
wanted
cheap
and
some
taste
but
i
would
rather
have
a
light
beer
if
i
just
wanted
volume
so
it
kind
of
falls
into
a
hole
on
its
own
drinkability
never
again
this
was
a
drain
pour
this
beer
is
only
for
those
who
want
to
get
drunk
for
little
money
this
isnt
a
beer
to
buy
to
taste
you
drink
these
to
get
drunk
it
tastes
and
smells
pretty
much
like
watered
down
grainy
corny
mash
it
looked
ok
but
thats
just
because
it
had
a
little
more
color
than
light
beers
i
probably
wont
be
buying
this
again
i
used
to
drink
these
from
time
to
time
they
have
a
significance
in
my
history
as
i
was
introduced
to
steel
reserve
right
after
i
moved
out
to
columbus
i
felt
it
deserved
a
ba
review
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone
d
i
can
see
why
this
is
cheap
but
i
can
see
why
people
drink
it
it
has
a
high
abv
and
doesnt
taste
just
awful
it
is
meant
to
be
drank
in
large
quantities
as
i
used
to
do
with
friends
d
very
cheap
you
get
drunk
quickly
and
you
can
buy
it
at
almost
all
gas
stations
d
if
its
cold
enough
you
can
take
it
down
quickly
and
i
recommend
doing
so
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
more
of
an
american
malt
beverage
than
a
true
lager
in
fact
to
call
it
a
lager
is
a
crime
i
must
say
it
would
be
great
for
someone
who
wants
to
get
smashed
its
high
8
9
abv
is
sneeky
and
will
definatly
hit
you
after
just
one
of
these
mediocre
beers
no
wonder
it
is
called
high
gravity
i
would
never
serve
this
to
guests
but
might
drink
if
i
need
a
good
buzz
notes
for
some
reason
all
the
steel
reserve
around
here
is
6
0
abv
maybe
that
makes
it
more
palatable
well
now
didnt
a
nice
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
appear
to
my
delight
betcha
the
retention
was
phenomenal
well
exceeding
expectations
and
beginning
to
form
some
nice
lace
as
it
reduced
nose
however
was
rubbish
it
was
fusel
adjunct
perfumy
cloying
i
could
really
do
without
this
sort
of
thing
color
was
a
deep
gold
with
nequality
clarity
nothing
new
but
nothing
wrong
with
that
aspect
of
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
candy
sweetness
on
the
tongue
i
mean
really
sweet
like
cotton
candy
it
was
not
necessarily
unpleasant
but
for
a
hophead
it
was
pegging
the
opposite
end
of
the
meter
it
needed
an
offsetting
swig
of
water
to
cut
the
sweetness
finish
was
smooth
as
advertised
but
at
the
extreme
finish
i
was
still
jonesin
for
some
water
and
then
some
hops
way
too
sweet
this
had
hangover
tattooed
all
over
it
suck
a
couple
of
these
bad
boys
down
fall
asleep
and
awake
with
a
mother
of
a
dehydrated
brain
housing
group
ouch
cheers
d
the
only
saving
grace
here
is
that
it
gets
you
drunk
so
soon
you
wont
be
tasting
this
nasty
beer
ill
admit
it
steel
reserve
was
a
goto
beer
for
me
in
college
and
one
of
the
brands
that
captivated
me
before
i
turned
21
however
now
that
ive
matured
and
the
most
important
factor
for
me
in
buying
beer
isnt
alcoholtoprice
ratio
for
which
really
steel
reserve
cannot
be
beaten
ill
only
drink
one
of
these
when
i
want
to
reexperience
old
times
poured
a
decent
golden
yellow
with
some
nice
fizzy
head
a
bit
of
lacing
and
a
fair
amount
of
carbonation
very
sweet
and
malty
scent
not
a
lot
of
characteristics
but
not
bad
funky
taste
slightly
skunky
not
a
lot
there
beyond
a
sweet
maltiness
goes
down
slightly
thick
and
not
as
refreshing
as
it
should
have
been
wont
get
it
for
myself
too
watery
but
as
it
goes
for
cheap
beer
this
is
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
notesnot
going
to
buy
this
one
again
unless
i
am
just
looking
to
get
a
buzz
with
cheap
change
taste
the
taste
is
the
worst
thing
this
beer
has
going
for
it
too
much
of
a
corn
adjunct
taste
to
it
the
mouth
on
this
is
thin
and
slick
i
dont
like
the
feel
of
this
at
all
flavor
is
of
sweet
malts
slight
fruity
aftertaste
which
is
weird
not
bad
for
a
game
night
or
a
ball
game
this
would
hit
the
spot
but
ive
had
better
malt
liquors
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
into
a
tall
ale
glass
clear
dark
yellow
beer
with
a
finger
of
foam
that
didnt
last
long
smelled
like
a
corn
field
tasted
sweet
sweeter
than
many
ive
tried
mouthfeel
was
weak
and
unremarkable
maybe
ive
missed
the
point
d
this
is
meant
for
one
thing
only
getting
trashed
the
flavor
is
waaaay
too
sweet
to
be
an
easy
drinker
low
flavor
high
alcohol
what
a
novel
concept
the
taste
is
very
watery
and
mildly
sweet
alcohol
is
noticeable
but
hidden
well
pretty
smooth
goes
down
easy
only
reason
to
drink
this
is
to
catch
a
buzz
cause
it
tastes
like
nothing
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
aroma
is
of
malts
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
not
paticularly
good
alcohol
is
present
some
malts
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
below
average
drinkability
overall
there
is
nothing
great
about
this
beer
at
6
79
a
twelver
this
is
a
regular
for
me
when
i
just
want
something
decent
to
get
things
going
with
overall
ive
had
worse
but
like
those
others
ill
never
be
trying
this
again
drank
about
3
ounces
got
a
headache
decided
not
to
experiment
with
the
rest
of
the
can
its
definitely
smooth
drinking
not
particularly
flavorful
drinking
but
then
again
thats
not
why
you
buy
it
is
it
for
a
cheap
malt
liquor
its
pretty
good
though
no
shame
in
buying
it
compared
to
the
average
from
the
24
fl
oz
can
marked
oct2609g08011034
sampled
on
june
23
2009
the
pour
was
mainly
yellow
and
clear
with
an
incredible
carbonated
head
about
four
inches
thick
and
i
did
not
even
shake
the
can
but
it
faded
directly
surprisingly
good
lacing
it
had
the
aroma
of
malts
barley
and
alcohol
and
the
alcohol
was
the
leading
scent
the
taste
was
not
quite
as
alcoholstrong
as
the
aroma
but
it
was
there
along
with
vague
malts
and
hops
it
warmed
up
my
earlobes
and
that
only
seems
to
happen
when
i
drink
miller
products
this
is
gutcleaning
booze
ive
drunk
this
beer
from
time
to
time
over
several
months
always
served
in
glass
from
the
40
oz
bottles
the
color
is
a
fresh
yellow
tinged
toward
green
rather
than
red
the
aroma
is
slight
the
head
is
sturdy
at
first
but
doesnt
last
giving
way
to
a
lacy
residue
while
this
beer
has
never
bowled
me
over
in
the
way
that
certain
german
czech
and
dutch
lagerspilsners
have
it
is
nevertheless
of
a
reliably
high
quality
and
remarkably
satisfying
to
drink
i
find
it
difficult
to
imagine
how
it
can
have
rated
such
low
grades
unless
the
previous
evaluators
simply
dont
like
lagers
but
honestly
you
smell
like
a
sweaty
dad
the
only
reason
this
doesnt
get
a
5
is
the
price
as
it
is
generally
harder
to
find
than
most
beers
and
often
slightly
more
expensive
the
alcohol
content
makes
for
a
nice
buzz
and
given
my
size
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
day
the
large
cans
1624
oz
help
with
this
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
rapidly
vanishes
its
far
from
flat
though
lots
of
bubbles
smells
slightly
of
alcohol
and
strongly
of
grains
and
corn
theres
a
faint
skunkiness
to
it
but
theres
that
in
all
these
i
remember
this
being
grosser
for
some
reason
it
actually
drinks
pretty
easy
am
i
supposed
to
review
the
drinkablity
of
this
guy
in
regards
or
other
malt
liquors
tastes
pretty
clean
not
too
corny
i
should
mix
this
up
in
my
malt
liquor
rotation
it
might
be
just
better
out
of
the
24
ounce
can
as
opposed
to
the
40s
if
youre
trying
to
get
to
where
you
need
to
go
with
mostly
shortcutsthis
is
the
malt
liquor
for
you
being
a
college
studentthis
is
better
than
peewater
natty
lightand
actually
has
flavor
to
it
flavor
being
subjective
of
course
i
would
never
buy
this
beer
again
unless
i
was
really
really
broke
and
needed
to
get
really
drunk
really
fast
i
cant
have
respect
for
a
beer
that
i
see
almost
every
homeless
person
drinking
thank
god
i
only
have
one
can
of
this
stuff
stold
it
from
my
friends
fridge
as
it
had
been
sitting
there
for
about
a
month
untouched
i
would
prolly
drink
this
if
i
was
at
a
party
or
something
but
would
still
reach
for
pretty
much
any
other
popular
macro
lager
6
50
for
a
12
pack
at
8
1
abv
worth
every
penny
in
my
book
it
would
be
a
damn
shame
to
throw
this
over
your
backyard
fence
into
the
street
for
no
reason
whatsoever
picked
up
a
22oz
bottle
the
other
day
only
because
i
had
never
tried
it
before
and
it
was
only
like
1
29
ish
i
read
the
reviews
here
on
beer
advocate
first
before
trying
it
and
i
was
expecting
the
worst
it
turned
out
not
as
bad
as
i
imagined
i
was
surprised
that
the
8
1
was
hardly
noticable
until
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
that
22oz
then
i
felt
it
i
might
buy
this
beer
again
just
because
it
was
so
cheap
i
would
not
recomend
it
though
when
pouring
from
the
big
can
the
foam
was
light
wheat
in
color
and
dissapated
quickly
the
color
was
light
gold
yellow
the
smell
had
a
sence
of
high
gravity
which
there
is
the
smell
was
also
deep
hops
overtone
with
a
hint
of
wheat
and
a
hint
of
floral
the
taste
was
heavy
dull
and
hight
gravity
hops
mouthfeel
heavy
and
fullbodied
drinkability
it
would
be
good
if
it
werent
for
the
dominate
high
gravity
feel
final
thoughts
i
revisited
steel
reserve
recently
when
a
friend
brought
it
over
it
was
actually
surprisingly
decent
for
what
it
is
and
most
likely
receives
harsh
reviews
for
being
compared
to
an
imperial
ipa
or
stout
keeping
the
style
in
mind
this
delivers
on
many
levels
try
one
with
an
open
mind
before
you
review
im
sure
my
beer
karma
will
take
a
hit
for
admitting
drinking
this
i
just
wanted
to
add
to
the
dialog
that
i
think
some
of
you
are
being
too
harsh
on
211
you
have
to
rate
steel
for
what
it
is
an
8
1
lager
that
is
widely
available
and
can
be
purchased
for
a
couple
of
bucks
40oz
or
7
for
a
12
pack
you
cant
compare
it
directly
against
expensive
craft
beers
they
serve
different
purposes
you
cant
tell
me
that
the
astmd
of
a
beer
is
the
same
regardless
of
what
you
paid
for
it
if
a
single
22oz
bomber
costs
me
7
or
more
i
know
im
going
to
be
rating
it
with
different
expectations
in
mind
that
include
a
justification
of
the
cost
not
the
best
malt
liquor
ever
but
not
too
shabby
probably
will
never
buy
this
again
but
you
never
know
if
i
ever
decide
to
slum
it
again
this
will
be
the
beer
ill
get
note
good
beer
for
the
price
of
being
buzzed
when
you
are
in
the
mood
to
just
drink
and
not
worry
about
flavor
this
could
be
your
brew
if
not
haffenreffer
or
narragansett
edit
i
picked
up
a
12
pack
for
7
99
locally
they
evidently
make
the
same
stuff
in
12oz
cans
now
dangerously
drinkable
in
a
manner
that
suggests
that
if
you
dont
respect
this
beer
itll
mess
you
up
hardcore
not
bad
in
a
quantity
of
one
as
its
very
inoffensive
and
doesnt
seem
as
strong
as
it
is
at
first
i
can
see
why
it
seems
to
be
the
beer
of
choice
for
the
local
hobos
jduging
by
the
many
empty
cans
that
seem
to
congregate
under
the
freeway
appearance
seems
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
fair
head
smell
and
taste
is
a
sweet
malty
metallic
with
a
of
course
alchohol
making
it
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
mouthfeel
is
light
with
high
carbonation
its
kinda
what
i
expected
and
not
but
for
the
price
hey
why
not
22oz
bottle
a
golden
yellow
pour
with
a
big
white
fizzy
headlots

strong
aroma

i
can
power
through
most
nasty
beers
but
not
this
one
fail
im
sorry
but
if
i
have
to
get
drunk
this
bad
i
will
buy
a
bottle
of
mouthwash
at
the
dollar
store
motherofgod
out
of
a
24
oz
can
this
beer
was
a
perfectly
clear
pale
gold
color
with
lots
of
visible
rising
carbonation
the
two
finger
head
was
slightly
offwhite
and
retained
nicely
at
first
as
a
puffy
cap
then
a
small
collar
the
aroma
was
of
corn
mash
pale
malt
alcohol
and
faint
hops
the
flavors
were
actually
pretty
good
well
for
a
malt
liquor
anyway
i
tasted
pale
malt
sweet
malt
cereal
grains
hints
of
metal
and
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
left
an
oily
slick
on
my
tongue
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
good
best
when
damn
near
frozen
but
for
6
quite
drinkable
if
you
gotta
go
malt
its
a
cheap
classic
choice
d
quite
assertively
corny
which
is
probably
to
be
expected
given
that
it
pulls
it
off
pretty
admirably
its
quite
adjuncty
and
boozy
but
it
never
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
which
is
as
impressive
as
it
is
baffling
if
youre
on
an
extreme
budget
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
d

this
beer
is
not
for
me
bteer
than
expected
but
almost
undrinkable
note
had
this
again
recently
i
compared
it
side
by
side
with
hurricane
high
gravity
both
where
equally
drinkable
even
as
it
warmed
i
almost
prefer
this
over
the
hhg
recommended
for
what
it
is
not
bad
swill
thats
available
feels
weird
saying
it
but
this
is
not
all
that
bad
im
under
no
illusion
that
its
great
either
somewhat
ironically
it
seems
that
a
few
years
of
experience
with
bigass
beers
like
imperials
pilsners
strong
euro
lagers
and
even
double
ipas
gives
you
the
tools
to
appreciate
a
beer
like
this
im
not
any
kind
of
malt
liquor
expert
but
there
are
no
doubt
many
worse
out
there
than
this
im
pleasantly
surprised
im
glad
i
finally
found
a
beer
that
i
can
drink
alot
of
for
cheap
and
not
actually
mind
the
taste
of
i
will
happily
buy
this
again
plus
the
bottle
looks
pretty
cool
now
i
buy
two
24oz
cans
on
wednesday
nights
and
bring
them
to
the
pool
hall
leaving
one
in
the
fridge
there
until
friday
night
when
i
return
perfect
sipping
beer
but
you
have
to
develop
a
taste
for
its
queer
flavor
its
worth
it
in
the
long
run
absolutely
clear
dark
yellow
with
a
big
fizzy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
skim
of
fine
foam
that
leaves
little
lace
smells
of
cooked
grits
and
caramel
with
a
nice
hit
of
grain
alcohol
tastes
fairly
sweet
and
brashly
alcoholic
but
finishes
pretty
clean
for
the
style
nothing
really
off
just
a
one
trick
pony
heavy
duty
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
this
beer
is
for
those
that
want
a
powerful
beer
that
is
way
inexpensive
and
it
succeeds
on
both
fronts
easier
drinking
than
most
malt
liquors
cheers
its
something
i
would
definitely
buy
again
given
that
what
i
normally
consider
a
cheap
alternative
like
pbr
doesnt
taste
much
better
and
has
half
the
alcohol
content
might
as
well
get
a
bigger
bang
for
you
buck
when
youre
not
going
for
flavor
d
not
very
flavorful
at
all
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
strong
kick
its
a
decent
representation
of
its
style
for
whatever
that
might
be
worth
there
are
definitely
better
highoctane
beers
out
there
that
you
can
put
away
quickly
if
thats
what
youre
going
for
overall
not
good
but
better
than
expected
seriously
this
brew
runs
rings
around
any
of
the
big
threes
ice
beers
as
well
as
labatt
molson
etc
it
pours
with
a
decent
head
keeps
a
lace
to
the
end
my
glass
is
always
soap
free
and
presents
a
slight
floral
smell
as
it
warms
and
a
taste
of
almond
or
marzipan
and
of
course
alcohol
to
my
thinking
currently
this
is
the
only
one
of
its
kind
m
feels
like
a
beer
and
especially
an
aml
this
isnt
to
sip
and
savor
keep
it
cold
and
git
er
dun
otherwise
itll
get
wicked
ugly
had
a
40oz
of
this
back
in
college
attracted
by
its
alcohol
content
it
was
a
straw
gold
color
with
a
bad
head
there
was
little
smell
at
all
but
a
tad
sweet
the
mouthfeel
was
nothing
special
as
its
carbonation
was
overpowering
the
drinkability
is
okay
but
difficult
at
8
1ac
compared
to
others
in
the
style
colt
45
mickeys
etc
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
my
favorite
you
just
wont
ever
catch
me

public
rated
oct

d
i
doubt
i
would
buy
this
in
any
quantity
to
drink
myself
but
if
i
had
to
it
wouldnt
be
that
bad
certainly
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
ive
had
striking
an
exceptional
balance
between
american
macros
and
other
heavy
sweet
and
hot
malt
liquors
this
was
an
eyeopener
in
a
way
its
simply
not
that
bad
its
well
known
this
is
no
conisseurs
beverage
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
excellent
ok
maybe
not
excellent
its
alright
i
would
pick
a
40
of
steel
over
any
quantity
of
budweiser
any
day
i
find
it
to
be
highly
drinkable
the
taste
i
think
is
not
at
all
revolting
as
a
homeless
man
once
said
to
me
it
goes
down
easy
doesnt
fight
back
its
perfect
for
that
winding
down
after
work
part
of
the
day
if
you
have
only
two
dollars
in
your
pocket
so
again
highly
recomended
if
you
are
broke
and
thirsty
in
this
case
the
drinkability
is
directly
related
to
the
taste
you
have
to
drink
this
beer
the
same
way
you
would
assault
an
enemy
bunker
hard
and
fast
speed
is
the
key
drinkability
not
bad
i
dont
know
that
i
couldwould
do

it

became
a

the
smell
never
bothered
me
since
instead
of
that

was
an

i
personally
love

this
is
the
stuff
that
got
me
into
actually
liking
malt
liquor
i
dont
have
much
of
a
problem
with
the
211
at
all
it
tastes
great
has
a
decent
smell
and
the
mouthfeel
is
bar
none
better
than
most
malt
liquors
i
would
rank
this
up
there
as
probably
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
around
steel
reserve
is
the
ultimate
in
malt
liquers
if
you
want
to
get
messed
up
real
bad
and
real
quick
take
one
or
two
of
these
24s
down
and
youll
be
feeling
good
this
is
definantly
a
drink
to
be
consumed
when
ice
cold
otherwise
suffer
the
concequences
like
a
previous
reviewer
said
when
it
warms
up
it
does
taste
kind
of
like
a
rum
and
coke
only
a
stale
one
i
had
a
couple
of
these
before
my
math
class
last
semester
and
lets
just
say
i
did
not
learn
much
on
that
day
anyways
id
take
a
mickeys
over
this
any
day
but
if
you
wanna
get
fucked
up
real
quick
this
is
the
ticket
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
which
diminishes
to
nothing
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
not
particularly
good
and
has
a
grainy
almost
corn
like
character
the
taste
is
not
good
very
grainy
with
a
strong
unpleasant
aftertaste
becomes
increasingly
more
unpleasant
tasting
as
it
warmsif
you
can
drink
it
while
its
still
cold
its
not
too
bad
a
bit
rough
feeling
and
not
particularly
drinkable
a
rather
low
quality
beer
and
certainly
not
something
i
would
intentionally
have
again
although
for
some
strange
reason
i
know
i
will
finish
what
is
left
of
the
6
packwhich
i
guess
bumps
up
the
drinkability
this
is
another
extremely
cheap
beer
its
yellowish
in
color
and
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
aroma
nor
head
the
abv
is
very
high
but
it
is
not
very
tasty
slightly
bitter
but
drinkable
for
the
abv
and
the
price
not
great
but
it
gets
you
drunk
cheap
pretty
crappy
ah
the
memories
beginning
college
freshman
year
and
drinking
steel
reserve
basically
every
night
with
my
soccer
teammates
this
one
really
helped
me
build
a
nice
alcohol
tolerance
i
go
back
to
it
time
and
again
when
the
moneys
low
and
i
want
to
get
wasted
looks
like
urine
with
basically
no
head
smell
is
nonexistent
in
my
opinion
taste
is
quite
nice
in
style
comparison
when
this
ones
cold
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
with
some
grassy
adjuncts
noticed
alchohol
is
strong
and
gives
this
beer
a
kick
gets
worse
and
worse
the
more
it
warms
so
drink
it
quickly
this
brew
poured
a
medium
white
head
of
small
bubbles
it
has
a
transparent
golden
body
with
carbonation
and
a
hoppy
aroma
its
hoppy
taste
was
smooth
with
a
bit
of
tang
to
the
aftertaste
it
is
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
you
can
still
taste
the
alcohol
in
if
you
dont
mind
the
buzz
or
are
looking
for
it
buy
this
beer
this
brew
poured
a
medium
white
somewhat
creamy
head
that
dissolved
rather
quickly
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
to
it
the
carbonation
could
be
seen
rising
to
the
top
i
was
not
impressed
by
this
brew
at
all
wow
and
wow
again
this
malt
lager
pours
a
bright
golden
color
slight
carbonation
a
rapidly
disolving
head
the
aroma
is
aweful
mainly
of
dishsoap
enough
to
sniff
only
once
off
the
bat
a
sweet
and
malty
taste
a
tad
carbonated
and
yes
slightly
creamy
some
alcohol
can
be
noted
and
a
nice
feel
on
the
palate
similar
to
a
decent
lager
lets
not
get
carried
away
but
in
the
category
of
cheap
lets
get
drunk
fast
for
95
cents
per
24
ounces
this
is
a
good
malt
beverage
it
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
dissipated
relatively
quickly
there
was
very
little
bubbling
action
the
smell
was
very
modest
and
i
had
to
try
hard
to
get
a
small
whiff
of
malt
the
taste
was
thin
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
with
almost
no
hop
presence
except
a
trace
in
the
finish
their
was
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
crisp
and
clean
the
body
was
light
and
the
carbonation
feel
was
mediumlight
there
was
a
slightly
sweet
lingering
flavor
the
drinkability
was
ok
i
will
not
make
a
habit
of
drinking
this
one
but
if
i
am
somewhere
and
nothing
better
is
available
i
will
drink
another
this
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
color
with
a
dissipating
moderate
white
head
the
mouthfeel
is
as
expectedthin
the
smell
is
sweet
and
cereal
like
with
a
slight
sourness
the
taste
is
a
nearly
overwhelming
sweetness
with
a
strong
alcohol
finish
this
is
a
very
sweet
high
alcohol
mass
produced
under
whelming
beer
pours
a
brassy
golden
color
quite
clear
with
a
small
white
head
that
soon
fades
to
scattered
islands
of
foam
carbonation
is
lively
the
lacing
is
fair
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
pungent
sweet
alcohol
light
maltiness
and
juicy
berry
notes
tasting
yields
slightly
rough
carbonation
sweet
light
malt
quite
pronounced
alcohol
flavors
and
towards
the
finish
mildly
bitter
medicinal
hops
the
alcohol
is
quite
warming
almost
like
a
shot
of
liquor
the
mouth
feel
is
pleasant
this
beer
proves
that
malt
liqour
can
aspire
to
the
same
lofty
heights
as
other
styles
of
beer
at
ninetynine
cents
for
a
24
ounce
can
centennial
liquors
austin
tx
this
seems
like
a
great
value
for
the
money
this
is
by
far
the
best
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
i
had
heard
some
sketchy
things
about
it
around
ru
so
i
was
reluctant
to
try
it
but
i
figured
if
they
like
natty
and
they
didnt
like
this
then
it
must
be
rather
heavy
tasteing
well
i
must
say
its
not
too
heavy
but
its
a
far
cry
from
anything
light
the
color
was
a
very
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
to
it
the
head
died
out
quickly
and
left
a
lace
the
taste
starts
out
light
but
opens
up
quickly
on
the
alcohol
you
can
still
feel
the
tingleing
of
the
alcohol
after
a
while
coats
your
mouth
and
makes
you
feel
warm
and
fuzzy
inside
definately
my
go
to
now
that
i
am
broke
its
a
cheap
1
for
a
22oz
but
i
may
have
to
spring
the
extra
75
for
the
40oz
drink
on
my
brotheren
pours
a
crystal
clear
yellowgold
with
a
densely
creamy
brightwhite
head
that
holds
surprisingly
well
it
eventually
drops
but
keeps
a
thin
surface
covering
and
leaves
some
minor
lace
the
nose
expresses
a
sweet
malt
with
some
clear
alcohol
and
a
touch
of
fruitiness
but
otherwise
its
quite
clean
its
full
bodied
with
a
fine
carbonation
thats
lightly
effervescent
and
gently
caresses
the
tongue
crisp
yet
smooth
the
flavor
offers
clean
sweet
adjunctladen
malt
with
a
clear
note
of
alcohol
and
an
underlying
bitterness
it
finishes
drying
with
some
lingering
sweet
malt
its
cleaner
than
many
malt
liquors
and
may
be
fermented
a
bit
cooler
but
other
than
that
theres
not
much
going
on
here
still
its
not
a
bad
choice
within
the
style
buddy
brought
this
to
work
lots
of
malt
aweful
taste
this
is
the
beer
you
need
if
you
want
to
get
hammered
this
is
beyond
bad
but
that
buzz
kicked
in
after
the
second
sip
the
paper
cup
i
was
drinking
it
with
had
more
flavor
i
feel
like
gargelling
with
turpintine
to
get
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
some
white
head
a
very
little
i
cant
see
the
difference
between
a
beer
like
this
and
any
other
macro
beer
it
has
a
higher
alcohol
content
but
it
is
still
the
same
ricesugar
adjunct
flavor
i
might
even
smell
a
little
bit
of
malt
i
tried
it
out
of
curiousity
and
for
99
cents24
oz
can
i
guess
it
has
its
own
time
and
place
this
was
a
rough
one
ghetto
juice
almost
too
bad
to
handle
malt
beyond
belief
and
a
just
nasty
taste
in
general
then
again
what
is
the
purpose
of
a
malt
liquor
thick
and
sweet
yet
skunky
mouthfeel
is
hard
to
even
recognize
while
battling
the
taste
i
think
this
one
makes
other
malt
liquors
look
like
top
notch
craft
brews
clear
light
golden
in
color
minimal
head
and
little
lace
heavily
carbonated
somewhat
sweet
tasting
with
strong
alcohol
taste
medium
bodied
with
mouth
coating
mouthfeel
finishes
sweetly
alcoholic
oh
the
steel
truly
high
gravity
it
will
push
you
down
until
you
hit
the
floor
it
has
quite
a
high
kick
at
8
1
but
when
had
cold
is
very
drinkable
i
remember
that
one
night
i
quickly
pounded
two
steel
40s
oh
wait
no
i
dont
remember
that
night
thats
the
power
of
the
steel
i
know
that
the
alcohol
per
dollar
ratio
is
great
but
avoid
this
like
the
plague
even
among
malt
liquors
steel
reserve
is
one
of
the
worst
beverages
out
there
it
tastes
like
gasoline
and
will
rip
your
stomach
in
two
drink
a
liquid
plumber
and
ammonia
cocktail
before
you
drink
steel
reserve
for
the
love
of
god
stay
the
hell
away
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
sampled
malt
liquor
but
i
decided
to
pick
up
a
40
o
z
of
somthing
and
dive
right
in
i
decided
on
steel
reserve
211
and
yes
i
drank
it
straight
from
the
bottle
at
8
1
i
was
feelin
the
alcohol
about
halfway
down
the
bottle
this
stuff
smells
slightly
skunky
but
i
couldnt
tell
if
it
was
because
of
the
of
the
clear
bottle
or
because
its
supposed
to
be
that
way
this
tastes
slightly
sweet
rather
light
and
finishes
up
with
a
swallow
that
lets
you
know
this
thing
has
alcohol
in
it
was
it
good
no
was
it
bad
yeah
it
was
bad
but
i
had
a
buzz
going
after
drinking
it
and
i
must
say
i
have
had
alot
worse
both
macro
and
microwise
peace
out
time
to
wash
the
hoopty
and
catch
some
ncaa
bball
notes
one
of
the
most
drinkable
malt
liquors
i
have
tasted
one
of
the
more
alcoholic
ones
i
have
run
into
also
even
when
it
warms
up
a
bit
it
does
not
get
ghastly
like
other
malt
liquors
do
this
is
really
really
bad
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
head
that
falls
flat
almost
immediately
the
smell
is
very
sharp
and
metallic
tangy
with
no
aroma
of
hops
whatsoever
the
first
sip
was
tart
and
crisp
almost
ciderlike
but
this
quickly
turned
into
a
sweet
cloying
sharp
and
metallic
flavor
that
was
almost
unbearable
by
the
end
of
my
glass
very
cheap
and
adjuncty
most
likely
sugar
with
rice
no
taste
of
corn
detected
and
certainly
no
hop
flavor
to
be
found
mouthfeel
was
medium
thin
and
highly
carbonated
this
tasted
cheap
tacky
and
unfortunate
very
similar
in
flavor
to
steel
reserve
or
another
budget
american
malt
liqour
shall
not
be
drinking
again
one
thing
dont
let
this
sit
in
your
fridge
for
months
or
youll
only
get
the
bad
poured
into
a
seattle
beer
week
pint
glass
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
is
active
during
the
pour
and
then
dissipated
quickly
to
a
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
undentifiable
light
estery
bandaid
or
exotic
fruit
hints
of
banana
flavor
is
almost
uncategorizable
starting
off
all
right
with
sweet
malt
lightly
grainy
but
developing
odd
fruit
and
medicinal
flavors
finishes
with
sweet
malt
with
sweet
adjunt
components
and
the
closest
ive
had
to
genuine
bandaid
in
a
beer
ive
only
had
hints
of
this
before
so
its
almost
endearing
light
bodied
the
flavors
are
low
key
which
actually
is
a
plus
because
some
of
these
would
not
be
an
asset
in
higher
concentration
as
it
is
it
kind
of
a
very
oddly
flavored
amped
up
adjunct
beer
so
the
malt
liquor
style
is
the
best
fit
american
malt
liquor
meets
odd
exotic
fruits
and
friends
it
was
intriguing
enough
to
keep
me
interested
for
a
whole
glass
but
probably
not
a
repeat
performance
overall
i
enjoyed
this
it
was
the
perfect
complement
to
the
meal
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
again
late
note
poured
the
last
23
of
the
bottle
down
the
drain
nasty
stuff
i
have
fairly
low
expectations
of
malt
liquor
and
this
strange
bottle
with
its
smiling
jowly
monk
on
the
label
more
or
less
passed
them
drinkability
for
what
it
is
and
im
not
really
sure
what
it
is
its
o
k
is
this
really
a
malt
liquor
made
in
india
for
export
to
the
u
s
market
how
bizarre
is
that
and
why
the
belgian
character
but
on
the
other
hand
if
it
is
it
kind
of
works
i
like
it
better
than
quite
a
few
malt
liquors
out
there
technically
it
could
be
better
but
so
could
most
malt
liquors
poured
from
a
brown
24
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
this
was
the
high
point
for
this
beer
smell
had
notes
of
plastic
taste
is
very
bad
plasticssour
is
that
nyquil
maybe
cough
syrup
yuck
feels
light
and
blech
in
the
mouth
and
is
not
drinkable
i
was
able
to
get
through
about
16
ounces
of
this
the
rest
went
down
the
drain
notes
as
an
indian
beer
id
say
this
was
pretty
good
as
a
beer
in
comparison
to
most
other
beers
not
very
good
but
still
drinkable
not
the
hellish
experience
most
here
made
it
out
to
be
it
washed
down
my
indian
food
pretty
well
d
easy
drinkin
i
like
it
and
id
buy
one
every
once
in
a
while
nice
to
see
malt
liquor
in
a
22oz
bottle
as
its
a
pain
in
the
ass
to
get
oe
in
22s
around
here
d
about
as
drinkable
as
a
211
steele
reserve
having
a
hard
time
putting
it
down
but
since
my
brother
bought
it
im
gonna
finish
it
although
not
entirely
unpleasant
its
difficult
to
finish
the
entire
bottle
of
this
one
not
going
to
be
buying
this
again
this
beer
shouldnt
be
allowed
to
have
a
monk
on
it
belgian
monks
would
rather
drink
their
own
well
you
know
than
drink
this
beer
d
by
style
drinkability
was
below
average
there
just
enough
reason
to
drink
this
in
multiples
and
have
to
say
i
struggled
through
half
a
bomber
before
i
threw
in
the
towel
this
actually
made
me
respect
their
other
beer
golden
eagle
a
bit
more
and
isnt
an
easy
thing
to
do
epic
fail
after
drinking
this
beer
im
pretty
sure
i
bought
the
indian
equivalent
of
hurricane
high
gravity
malt
liquor
the
beer
is
generally
as
per
usual
for
the
style
but
there
is
some
really
odd
aftertaste
im
hoping
that
it
is
the
attempt
to
have
a
belgiany
yeast
flavor
though
i
can
imagine
it
may
be
worse
things
not
a
beverage
i
would
procure
again
any
thing
that
says
it
is
a
super
beer
gets
a
try

mean
seriously

the
bar
tender
at
an
indian
restaurant
recommended
this
when
i
asked
if
they
had
any
dark
beers
they
didnt
but
he
seemed
to
think
this
came
closest
in
fact
it
was
just
yellow
i
poured
the
beer
myself
the
head
was
thin
and
bubbly
and
dissipated
quickly
there
looked
to
be
lots
of
carbonation
but
the
mouthfeel
was
not
fizzy
the
smell
was
strong
alcohol
and
very
sweet
the
taste
was
also
very
sweet
and
strong
alcohol
the
bottle
says
8
but
the
alcohol
taste
was
even
stronger
after
drinking
a
pint
i
also
felt
like
i
had
had
more
than
one
pint
of
8
beer
the
bottle
says
it
is
a
beer
for
beerlovers
i
dont
know
about
that
but
it
is
for
those
who
want
a
strong
beer
i
probably
wouldnt
order
this
beer
again
but
it
is
worth
trying
once
for
varietys
sake
looks
a
lot
like
an
american
macro
pale
yellow
with
no
head
very
bubbly
smells
like
sweet
rice
and
corn
tatse
is
not
good
not
sure
where
the
whole
super
beer
on
the
label
comes
from
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
i
actually
drank
this
with
a
friend
of
mine
from
india
he
said
this
is
what
they
would
drink
if
they
wanted
to
drunk
off
of
beer
not
liquor
take
that
for
what
its
worth
crisp
highly
carbonated
mouthfeel
how
to
rate
the
drinkability
of
this
is
hard
budweiser
is
better
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
this
wont
make
you
puke
unless
you
were
queasy
before
you
try
this
and
then
well
you
will
be
screwed
had
to
throw
away
gaaah
while
the
booze
doesnt
really
cause
any
problems
here
its
about
the
only
thing
that
doesnt
double
negatives
for
the
win
minhas
inbred
insidious
and
apparently
thorough
industrial
effluent
house
character
in
on
full
display
here
for
well
for
worse
only
i
dont
think
i
really
gotta
say
this
is
the
brewers
bestsuited
style
and
yet
this
offering
is
nothing
less
than
a
fucking
hurtful
hey
truth
in
advertising
mess
another
beer
from
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
has
some
sweetness
malts
a
bit
of
plastics
taste
is
malts
alcohol
a
touch
of
sweetness
some
green
apples
not
very
good
but
certainly
drinkable
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
not
a
bad
beer
about
average
for
this
style
o
for
an
american
malt
liquor
this
beer
is
pretty
good
no
alcohol
flavors
are
present
and
the
taste
isnt
really
dominated
by
flavors
of
adjunct
malts
the
crack
was
good
but
the
glug
was
a
stop
n
go
affair
as
it
simply
wanted
to
foam
up
and
be
a
general
pain
in
the
ass
the
smell
really
activated
my
gag
reflex
with
its
combination
of
cotton
candy
plastics
factory
and
dry
cleaning
plant
odors
upon
settling
i
ended
up
with
two
rocky
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
marginal
retention
loads
of
lacing
in
its
wake
as
it
fell
color
was
a
pale
strawyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
loads
of
co2
bubbles
in
evidence
it
was
as
effervescent
as
alkaseltzer
which
i
may
need
after
i
am
done
with
this
bringing
it
up
to
my
mouth
i
caught
a
whiff
of
what
smelled
like
hydrogen
peroxide
and
i
began
to
sweat
suddenly
the
heavy
tramp
of
cybermen
could
be
heard
in
the
alley
behind
my
gate
i
was
once
again
going
to
be
subsumed
by
dint
of
drinking
a
cancoction
unfit
for
humans
curse
you
minhas
for
being
a
front
for
these
unfeeling
aliens
my
first
sip
was
initially
decent
with
a
full
creamy
mouthfeel
and
an
initial
taste
of
vanilla
twinkielike
until
i
got
hit
with
the
rest
of
it
let
me
now
turn
to
jeremy
gordon
of
theclassical
org
for
his
take
two
flavors
stood
out
for
me
in
big
hurt
1
sour
and
2
gross
with
an
aftertaste
that
felt
like
id
just
spit
out
a
mouthful
of
shaving
cream

ha
i
would
find
that
even
more
humorous
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
my
bodily
functions
were
beginning
to
cease
and
my
joints
were
turning
into
aluminum
you
know
i
always
wondered
what
became
of
all
of
those
cans
that
i
recycled
but
now
it
dawns
on
me
that
they
are
made
into
cybermen
suits
into
which
our
brains
are
transferred
alcoa
is
a
shill
for
the
cybermen
i
am
selling
my
stock
asap
quiet
the
cyberleader
is
giving
us
our
orders
i
now
love
the
taste
of
this
beverage
it
smells
perfect
i
really
like
the
bonedry
aspect
of
the
finish
which
renders
it
very
refreshing
inside
of
this
metallic
suit
i
must
buy
more
and
pass
it
out
to
all
of
my
acquaintances
the
cyberleader
has
spoken
and
i
hear
and
obey
at
first
i
was
surprised
at
its
clarity
and
crisp
smell
it
has
a
nice
head
to
it
nothing
too
overboard
the
taste
is
mostly
clean
with
bit
of
a
back
tongue
grab
its
finish
is
clean
and
non
lingering
and
thats
what
i
like
in
a
lager
overall
it
was
somewhat
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
harsh
astringency
numbing
alcohol
flaccid
without
any
flavor
grain
husks
and
wet
paper
cheap
wine
with
club
soda
carbonation
people
think
this
is
actually
decent
lol
this
beer
was
better
than
i
expected
if
this
is
a
malt
liquor
then
its
the
best
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
i
i
had
plenty
in
college
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
initially
fizzes
then
dissapates
the
scent
is
sweet
with
presence
of
saaz
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
with
effervesance
of
grain
and
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
its
ok
if
the
abv
was
dialed
back
to
55
5
it
would
be
better
holy
what
the
this
is
insane
such
an
obnoxiously
sweet
nose
on
this
thing
flavor
is
just
gross
this
is
really
atrocious
and
i
cant
believe
that
it
was
in
the
craft
beer
section
of
where
i
bought
it
i
mean
come
on
for
beers
like
this
we
shouldnt
need
250
words
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
fruity
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
fairly
drinkable
and
not
all
that
bad
for
the
style
overall
drinkability
as
a
refreshing
light
beer
this
doesnt
work
as
a
malt
liquor
this
kicks
ass
notes
surprisingly
decent
especially
for
a
cheap
malt
liquor
not
a
good
beer
but
for
what
it
is
it
is
good
no
offflavors
or
grape
drank
flavor
for
a
malt
liquor
is
nice
i
cant
really
see
getting
this
another
time
but
i
might
if
i
want
a
malt
liquor
and
this
makes
me
feel
like
im
back
in
college
so
it
has
that
going
for
it
drink
the
big
hurt
put
a
big
hurt
on
my
feelings
man
great
ball
player
shit
beer
oh
well
its
a
1
50
what
did
i
expect
ehh
it
is
what
it
is
this
is
fine
if
your
looking
to
get
sauced
before
a
game
and
looking
for
a
high
abv
malt
poured
a
24
oz
can
into
a
masskrug
the
white
head
stands
about
12
inch
pouring
pale
yellow
body
shows
visible
rising
carbonation
aroma
is
rather
plain
light
malt
with
a
sweetness
i
cant
exactly
place
i
want
to
say
apple
but
thats
not
right
the
taste
comes
in
with
a
slight
smoothness
i
get
some
light
sweetness
as
well
as
a
odd
funk
like
flavor
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
expected
medium
body
with
pretty
good
carbonation
overall
not
a
beer
id
drink
again
its
about
what
i
expected
from
a
malt
liquor
overall
yikes
i
wont
get
this
again
it
isnt
terrible
but
i
prefer
a
thousand
other
options
the
other
can
i
bought
will
be
headed
out
in
my
box
for
the
disc
golf
bif
but
that
was
my
intention
anyway
better
than
colt
45
but
thats
about
all
i
can
give
it
sweet
syrupy
and
boozy
warmth
on
teh
palate
best
if
you
drink
this
fast
before
it
warms
up
too
much
pretty
much
like
every
other
cheap
malt
liquor
that
ive
had
except
this
one
has
a
funky
corn
and
sweet
bandaid
flavor
im
not
going
to
say
its
terrible
because
its
frank
thomas
but
its
not
very
good
haha
o
this
beer
is
pretty
clean
but
it
has
some
odd
flavors
and
to
much
alcohol
to
make
it
refreshing
and
the
reveal
isbig
hurt
beer
awesome
when
i
was
a
kid
i
was
a
huge
frank
thomas
fan
and
when
i
read
about
this
swore
id
get
a
can
at
some
point
so
killing
2
birds
with
one
stone
its
actually
not
that
bad
for
malt
liquor
and
better
than
most
i
liked
it
better
than
the
super
15
d
its
absolutely
better
than
i
hoped
it
would
be
but
thats
not
quite
enough
to
say
it
was
truly
enjoyable
o
actually
better
than
i
was
expecting
would
not
buy
it
again
but
would
drink
it
over
almost
any
macro
frank
thomas
played
baseball
about
eleventybillon
times
beer
then
this
beer
tasted
hes
a
hofer
but
this
beer
is
not
o
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
doesnt
taste
bad
im
not
saying
its
good
but
i
didnt
mind
it
at
all
light
yellow
18th
in
snow
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
bit
smells
like
old
rusty
water
you
know
when
you
turn
on
the
hose
form
sitting
all
winter
the
taste
reminds
me
of
a
quieter
steel
reserve
the
sweetness
to
be
exact
i
like
everything
dry
so
that
off
the
bat
is
not
appealing
the
alcohol
is
there
and
abundant
might
have
been
smoother
if
it
was
on
tap
i
think
i
would
have
been
better
off
slinging
1
69
for
a
24oz
of
pbr
instead
of
2
buck
for
this
dnot
as
terrible
as
i
imagined
but
nothing
mindblowing
either
one
plus
is
that
the
alcohol
is
not
noticeable
at
all
for
7
which
i
thought
would
be
very
present
in
a
beer
this
light
bodiedcoloredflavored
d
one
of
the
better
tasting
malt
liquors
ive
had
although
i
suspect
the
lower
abv
is
a
huge
advantage
if
this
was
12
and
tasted
the
same
itd
be
seriously
impressive
as
is
its
merely
an
above
average
higherabv
adjunct
lager
would
consider
purchasing
this
at
a
ballgame
over
many
of
the
other
horrendous
options
although
us
cellular
actually
offers
some
good
beers
im
a
chisox
fan
and
quite
the
ticker
this
is
not
a
necessarily
good
combination
when
random
new
soxthemed
beers
come
about
this
one
arrived
in
my
area
a
couple
days
ago
1
79
for
a
24oz
can
based
on
experience
this
is
not
a
good
start
it
pours
a
clear
paleish
golden
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
craggy
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
flour
corn
syrup
light
biscuit
semisweet
flowers
and
grass
its
not
too
bad
so
far
the
taste
though
finally
brings
the
quasiexpected
storm
notes
of
corn
syrup
sweetgrass
flowers
rice
cake
honey
hard
water
and
freshfromthecob
corn
wow
this
stuff
is
somehow
both
sickly
sweet
and
mineralladenly
vegetative
the
body
is
a
stolid
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
syrupy
feel
just
like
the
taste
the
feel
is
kinda
oxymoronic
feeling
both
smoothly
flowing
and
thickly
stiff
im
definitely
not
smiling
with
this
stuff
on
my
tongue
overall
big
frank
said
he
wouldnt
put
his
name
on
a
bad
beer
looks
like
he
was
right
this
is
a
downright
crappy
beer
of
course
with
that
abv
and
the
other
options
around
id
probably
still
drink
this
at
the
cell
if
the
sox
dont
start
improving
soon
somethings
gotta
take
my
mind
off
of
the
sadness
on
the
field
definitely
sadness
here
in
this
can
o
im
cracking
up
as
i
write
this
but
this
behind
old
e
has
gotta
be
my
2nd
favorite
malt
liquor
dude
its
really
not
that
bad
if
you
pour
it
into
a
fatbottomed
glass
its
the
can
or
the
bottle
that
makes
it
nasty
no
the
high
alcohol
content
lends
some
complexity
to
the
flavor
but
the
balance
here
is
sick
o
the
22
has
the
same
alcohol
as
three
regular
beers
and
gets
the
job
done
frankly
there
are
times
id
rather
have
a
dd
of
this
than
3
crummy
aals
a
40
of
this
stuff
is
a
ticket
to
a
quick
night
still
for
what
it
is
it
isnt
bad
but
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
long
way
from
good
too
this
stuff
is
only
for
the
experienced
and
the
adventurous
i
wont
go
into
a
thorough
review
here
keep
it
cold
and
drink
it
fast
and
be
prepared
to
get
messed
up
lol
in
a
league
of
other
malt
liquors
the
ides
will
hold
it
down
as
they
say
lol
not
the
worst
tasting
brew
out
there
but
far
from
good
if
your
trying
to
get
a
nice
buzz
or
kick
going
for
the
cheap
and
want
something
ok
tasting
for
the
power
behind
it
and
dollar
value
then
its
st
ides
been
drinking
it
on
and
off
for
over
10
years
now
it
never
fails
to
get
me
messed
for
the
price
tag
and
hell
remember
its
got
a
following
behind
it
too
in
the
celebrity
world
like
2
pac
ice
cube
snoop
dog
mike
tyson
lol
overall
a
rather
average
but
drinkable
malt
that
gets
the
job
done
cheap
it
is
strong
it
is
and
rather
fast
drinking
it
is
if
this
is
what
you
want
then
i
say
go
for
it
but
if
looking
for
something
with
a
bit
more
flavorcomplexity
then
this
may
not
be
your
choice
my
second
favorite
aml
behind
steel
reserve
heavy
corn
adjunct
smell
and
taste
yet
very
palatable
for
a
cheap
high
gravity
malt
liquor
as
long
as
you
dont
let
it
get
too
warm
actually
a
nice
hops
balance
and
not
overly
sweet
did
a
40
hands
with
this
and
forgot
what
planet
i
was
on
all
for
less
that
5
rip
tupac
overall
i
would
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
needs
to
get
a
great
buzz
going
on
a
budget
it
is
by
far
the
most
economical
beverage
i
have
seen
although
big
bear
and
natty
daddy
are
close
up
there
the
taste
is
pretty
decent
i
suggest
drinking
this
outside
in
the
winter
for
premium
flavor
o
it
lives
up
to
the
hype
but
only
if
you
can
find
it
extremely
unfresh
o
i
have
to
bow
down
to
this
malt
liquor
itll
make
you
check
yo
self
you
dont
have
to
be
men
of
steel
or
natural
born
killaz
to
enjoy
this
beer
stay
true
to
the
game
and
you
can
do
it
all
you
have
to
do
is
do
ya
thang
really
doe
im
sure
ive
said
it
before
but
this
is
levels
above
the
mainstream
macro
lagers
in
refinement
and
drinkability
cheers
ides
does
it
right
however
at
8
2
you
get
feeling
good
quickly
and
at
a
budget
price
i
didnt
look
much
at
this
since
i
really
didnt
care
what
it
looked
like
as
most
would
agree
its
beercolored
it
smelled
like
sweet
bad
strong
beer
which
can
be
o
k
sometimes
i
must
say
the
flavor
forced
me
to
end
the
experience
quickly
which
was
also
a
o
k
overall
it
gets
you
drunk
and
quick
dont
worry
nobody
takes
it
seriously
overall
drinkability
even
for
someone
looking
for
a
nice
small
buzz
this
has
a
chance
of
being
a
drain
pour
definitely
not
a
tasting
or
session
beer
avoid
httpwww
youtube
comwatchvwcz3fs9758e
well
beer
doesnt
taste
great
but
there
is
no
aftertaste
tastes
almost
like
nothing
mildly
dry
finish
lead
off
is
a
mild
sweetness
some
alcohol
but
the
finish
is
nice
actually
i
dont
hate
it
i
doubt
id
have
it
again
but
it
is
not
poison
which
is
pretty
good
for
the
style
nice
sweetened
corn
syrup
like
taste
mixed
with
solvent
or
industrial
cleanerfluid
gasoline
breath
afterwards
plenty
of
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
not
watery
but
bad
tasting
like
they
put
a
shot
of
vodka
a
shot
of
gasoline
together
with
sugar
packets
considering
it
is
a
cheap
malt
liquor
i
would
give
the
appearance
and
aroma
of
this
a
9
out
of
10
however
i
would
give
the
taste
a
3
out
of
10
the
pour
was
better
then
i
thought
with
a
medium
amber
color
and
a
head
of
about
two
inches
that
stuck
around
for
a
few
moments
before
falling
into
the
same
path
as
the
others
with
a
crystal
clear
dark
color
with
tiny
strings
of
bubbles
that
were
coming
up
through
the
glass
aroma
is
of
corn
alcohol
wet
hay
and
just
a
mess
really
just
astringent
and
not
very
appetizing
at
all
every
sip
seemed
to
bring
a
similar
reaction
from
me
as
i
struggled
to
get
this
one
down
before
finally
pouring
the
rest
out
just
not
a
redeeming
quality
as
far
as
taste
and
i
generally
do
not
mind
the
style
terribly
but
this
was
atrocious
d
this
was
just
awful
this
one
i
am
glad
i
cannot
purchase
readily
in
california
just
to
reiterate
awful
rjt
having
consumed
natural
light
before
as
well
as
miller
and
bud
and
even
oe
and
colt
45
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
probably
also
the
quickest
way
to
get
drunk
on
beer
when
i
drink
this
it
makes
me
feel
weird
for
around
3
dollars
a
bottle
st
ides
hg
malt
liquor
gives
perhaps
the
best
bang
for
its
buck
as
far
as
experience
interesting
label
no
smell
good
taste
excellent
drinkability
and
the
most
unique
feeling
from
ghetto
swill
you
will
ever
experience
taste
is
most
certainly
alcoholic
fruitiness
but
there
is
a
pretty
stable
backbone
of
cereal
grains
in
there
not
as
bad
as
i
had
feared
clean
finish
with
not
alot
of
sweetness
that
lingers
pretty
good
job
of
making
a
high
abv
light
bodied
lager
and
still
be
drinkable
i
dont
exactly
like
it
but
i
think
i
will
be
able
to
finish
this
can
barely
i
used
to
drink
this
beer
all
the
time
when
i
was
young
lol
and
have
friends
that
still
do
i
think
this
beer
is
good
if
you
need
alittle
liqiud
courage
or
for
a
poor
mans
viagra
i
dont
know
what
they
put
in
this
stuff
but
if
you
just
want
to
get
drunk
its
cheap
and
works
from
a
clear
22
oz
bottle
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malt
and
corn
taste
is
rather
yucky
flavors
of
corn
and
alcohol
not
very
pleasent
in
the
mouth
either
drinkability
is
also
low
not
much
to
recomend
about
this
beer
ah
st
ides
high
gravity
malt
liquor
the
last
beer
that
did
me
in
made
me
hug
the
toilet
and
caused
me
to
pass
out
and
that
was
ages
ago
i
have
not
touched
it
since
but
i
figured
it
was
time
to
rate
it
so
i
had
to
twist
off
the
top
and
dive
in
it
was
unimpressive
then
and
it
is
unimpressive
now
it
pours
yellow
with
about
two
fingers
of
bubbly
white
head
and
decent
clarity
it
looks
like
it
is
supposed
to
so
i
rate
it
average
the
aroma
emits
a
scent
of
corn
malts
and
strong
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
better
than
water
but
still
pretty
weak
it
tastes
like
a
sour
metallic
shot
of
alcohol
and
leaves
a
bad
aftertaste
it
is
a
cheap
way
to
get
a
buzz
if
that
is
what
you
are
in
the
mood
to
do
drain
poured
most
of
it
taste
imagine
dropping
a
shot
or
two
of
everclear
into
a
busch
beer
adjuncts
and
alcohol
nothing
repulsive
in
my
opinion
but
theres
nothing
good
to
talk
about
either
for
me
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
pleasure
in
drinking
the
beer
serving
it
nearly
frozen
to
mask
flavor
and
smell
then
shotgunning
it
doesnt
cut
it
for
me
id
like
to
know
the
beer
im
drinking
is
actually
reasonable
and
drinkable
not
recommended
try
another
malt
liquor
to
get
messed
up
on
overall
the
beer
was
about
as
errorfree
as
can
be
expected
from
a
malt
liquor
but
the
beer
has
a
lot
of
voids
where
the
characterful
flavors
should
be
not
a
particularly
recommended
beer
but
servicable
in
a
pinch
a
seriously
bad
pinch
not
the
greatest
tasting
malt
beverage
but
it
can
surely
deal
you
a
quick
buzz
tastes
like
rubbing
alcohol
with
a
slight
hint
of
grain
pours
out
in
a
slick
pale
amber
color
mild
carbonation
and
little
taste
of
good
old
american
hops
slides
down
the
throat
easy
enough
as
do
most
malt
liquors
but
the
lack
of
good
beer
taste
damages
this
ones
appeal
the
taste
is
alcohol
sweet
cheap
white
wine
with
ghosty
elements
of
white
grape
juice
and
stale
corn
with
a
brief
alcoholic
finish
and
almost
no
aftertaste
it
is
very
bland
after
the
first
sip
for
whatever
reason
i
am
partial
to
malt
liquor
st
ides
is
defintely
not
one
of
my
favorites
it
should
be
i
like
high
gravity
malts
from
time
to
time
but
this
malt
makes
me
feel
weird
when
i
drink
it
it
starts
off
with
a
pungent
first
sip
and
by
the
time
i
reach
the
label
on
the
40
i
think
hey
this
stuff
is
not
so
bad
but
the
minute
this
brew
warms
up
it
takes
on
a
harshmetallic
character
this
beer
makes
me
feel
nauseated
no
thanks
st
ides
the
nice
thing
about
these
macros
is
their
head
i
produced
a
solid
two
fingers
worth
of
dense
bonewhite
head
with
excellent
retention
off
of
the
pour
the
nose
on
the
other
hand
smelled
like
liquid
death
it
smelled
like
a
can
of
gasoline
left
out
to
near
its
flash
point
fusel
alcohol
to
the
max
oof
the
color
was
another
winner
it
had
a
beautiful
shade
of
golden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
mouthfeel
reminded
me
of
the
last
scene
in
what
we
do
is
secret
when
darby
crash
realizes
that
hes
gone
a
bit
too
far
but
there
is
no
turning
back
from
the
inevitable
his
was
a
heroin
overdose
mine
was
a
stomachwrenching
sensation
followed
by
a
strange
mellowness
and
a
desire
for
another
hit
i
mean
swig
powerful
stuff
this
was
no
playing
around
certainly
not
meant
for
amateurs
and
even
i
as
a
seasoned
veteran
could
not
wrap
my
liver
around
this
beast
avoid
boy
avoid
aaarrrggh
pretty
standard
for
a
malt
liquor
this
is
a
drink
that
surely
thrives
on
underage
drinkers
getting
dumb
adults
to
purchase
it
with
the
last
20
they
had
it
is
a
harsh
raunchy
smell
with
a
fizzy
spoiled
fruit
flavor
they
taste
is
no
improvement
this
is
no
beer
and
if
you
cant
count
hard
ciders
malt
beverages
should
be
no
different
its
a
wine
cooler
after
it
went
on
a
bender
and
got
hung
over
dthis
beer
is
not
as
wretched
as
i
had
suspectedi
guess
it
is
what
it
is
a
powerful
swill
at
a
low
price
not
completely
devoid
of
flavor
but
bland
presentation
40
oz
bottle
little
foam
in
the
bottle
typical
40
oz
malt
liquor
smell
metalic
alcohol
and
sugary
it
takes
like
a
normal
malt
liquor
full
of
alcohol
and
various
other
flavors
such
as
numerous
grains
st
ides
has
a
little
sugary
tastes
makes
it
sweeter
than
others
mouthfeel
not
that
bad
and
not
that
good
either
drinkability
nothing
that
horrible
about
st
ides
but
mine
tasted
a
little
od
other
than
that
nothing
that
special
and
nothing
that
bad
a
reminder
of
what
some
companiesbrewers
will
produce
and
call
a
beer
nasty
yellowish
color
with
a
bubbly
tan
head
looks
to
have
a
higher
carbonation
than
average
smells
like
alcohol
and
bad
malt
the
taste
is
badly
bitter
with
some
old
cut
grass
in
there
it
has
a
syrupy
yet
heavily
carbonated
body
perhaps
drinkable
if
you
are
too
drunk
to
taste
anything
i
cant
fully
give
this
malt
liquor
it
justice
because
this
review
is
on
vivid
memory
i
cant
even
bring
myself
to
spend
the
buck
to
sample
it
and
throw
it
away
i
drank
a
lot
of
these
in
college
and
it
is
also
my
wifes
first
memory
of
me
she
walked
into
the
house
w
her
friends
at
a
house
party
and
saw
me
sitting
on
the
couch
drinking
a
st
ides
she
always
tells
the
story
that
i
was
holding
it
at
my
crotch
like
some
giant
phallic
symbol
i
remember
this
being
really
sweet
compared
to
other
malt
liquors
real
sugary
i
also
remember
the
dark
gold
hue
in
the
bottle
let
you
know
that
this
wasnt
watered
down
there
were
also
hints
of
fruit
or
berries
and
i
use
to
be
able
to
down
these
with
the
best
of
them
not
anymore
d
i
can
drink
one
of
these
anymore
than
that
would
probably
be
overkill
for
me
but
then
again
i
am
a
lightweight
to
its
credit
it
hides
the
alcohol
extremely
well
it
has
an
impressive
head
considering
the
majority
of
its
audience
will
not
see
it
the
body
is
slightly
sticky
but
is
probably
at
the
optimal
point
for
the
style
serves
its
purpose
but
not
much
else
and
your
brain
be
sizzlin
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
thin
body
and
is
super
carbonated
the
beer
is
not
gag
inducing
but
it
isnt
good
this
is
an
acceptable
vehicle
to
deliver
8
alcohol
this
beer
should
be
served
cold
and
from
the
can
drink
this
one
fast
so
um
ok
appearance
was
semi
nothing
it
poured
a
very
light
clear
color
and
the
can
it
came
in
looked
like
the
cover
for
some
lame
japanese
cartoon
the
smell
was
not
apparent
at
all
i
tried
so
hard
that
i
managed
to
inhale
some
of
it
through
my
nose
i
wouldnt
recomend
that
it
stings
so
yea
moving
on
the
taste
was
not
very
apparent
either
carbination
and
a
wateresque
taste
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
wasnt
much
better
than
the
rest
of
it
the
mouthfell
was
very
watery
and
carbonated
drinkability
was
a
2
and
thats
only
if
you
wanna
get
smashed
on
a
low
budget
for
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
this
it
is
quite
easy
to
drink
classic
malt
liquor
flavor
probably
my
idea
of
the
perfect
malt
flavor
combined
with
excellent
carbonation
superior
holding
strength
on
the
flavor
even
when
it
warms
up
it
is
drinkable
nothing
offensive
at
all
about
this
high
gravity
in
fact
youll
be
more
offensive
after
finishing
a
40
of
this
quite
possibly
the
best
high
gravity
malt
liquor
out
there
next
day
my
stomach
feels
like
theres
a
knot
inside
it
i
had
the
worst
craps
ever
no
mas
ever
d
poor
the
little
that
i
had
was
hard
to
handle
overall
its
not
a
bad
malt
liquor
its
clean
and
somewhat
balanced
with
a
big
maltiness
upfront
and
then
a
lot
of
kick
behind
not
great
but
ok
drinkabilty
no
thankyou
definitely
not
for
me
the
can
depicts
a
pretty
effin
viscious
wrotweiller
biting
into
a
24oz
can
of
this
stuff
youd
think
hed
know
better
well
i
cant
lie
early
on
in
my
drinking
days
i
used
to
imbibe
on
the
st
ides
special
brews
original
alcohol
pops
leave
me
the
hell
alone
snoop
used
to
sing
in
their
commercials
what
do
you
expect
from
a
thug
rap
loving
eighth
grader
anyways
on
to
the
high
gravity
version
of
this
malt
liquor
it
appears
a
bright
golden
yellow
hue
with
a
vibrant
white
head
leaves
fine
even
lacing
as
the
thick
head
dwindles
pretty
quickly
aromatics
well
i
cant
say
this
is
any
type
of
a
beer
delicacy
very
heavy
on
corn
and
rice
along
with
alcohol
in
the
aroma
not
good
at
all
sweet
smelling
overall
i
guess
taste
wow
possibly
the
worst
beer
or
malt
liquor
ive
ever
tasted
i
compare
this
one
to
paint
thinner
toned
flavors
with
very
sweet
and
alcoholic
tones
hitting
you
at
once
seems
chemical
as
a
whole
no
hop
profile
to
be
had
just
pure
shit
awwgh
cloyingly
sweet
with
a
slight
metallic
layer
on
the
tongue
and
alcohol
remains
horrible
mouthfeel
fizzy
textured
heavy
carbonation
definitely
could
cause
a
gag
reflex
to
occur
on
the
typical
drinker
drinkability
dont
even
rate
this
brew
as
an
option
to
grab
onto
i
was
in
a
ghetto
liquor
malt
and
grabbed
one
for
fun
99cents
well
the
experiment
is
over
this
shit
is
horrible
i
dont
think
ive
ever
had
this
stuff
before
may
never
again
but
supposidly
this
is
the
king
of
ghetto
juice
pours
a
brownish
golden
color
no
head
smells
a
bit
sweet
like
corn
syrup
taste
is
quite
skunky
high
alcohol
like
paint
thinner
and
corn
syrup
mouthfeel
sucks
overall
its
what
you
expect
and
worse
ive
had
better
40s
before
this
aint
one
of
them
i
will
now
attempt
to
finish
it
cheers
tastes
sweet
malty
to
start
then
funky
funk
gives
me
the
willies
its
not
a
phenoilic
belgian
funk
its
more
like
a
strong
version
of
the
hint
of
funk
i
find
in
oktoberfests
the
beer
is
dry
and
there
is
a
bit
of
sweet
fruity
ester
in
there
canned
pear
syrup
i
guess
md
light
body
and
highly
carbonated
no
thanks
this
beer
poured
a
golden
straw
color
that
was
crystal
clear
and
very
well
carbonated
the
head
that
was
produced
was
very
large
and
pure
white
in
color
very
think
in
appearance
somewhat
sticky
and
pillowy
it
fell
rather
quick
and
left
a
ring
around
the
edges
and
some
light
tiny
carbonation
bubbles
on
the
surface
there
was
a
sticky
lace
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
was
simple
cooked
corn
grains
some
hints
of
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
had
a
carbonation
bite
to
it
hints
of
light
malts
some
bitterness
lots
of
cooked
watery
corn
waves
of
alcohol
were
all
through
the
taste
sometimes
bitter
sometimes
semi
sweet
but
the
constant
was
alcohol
the
body
was
medium
this
beer
has
lots
of
alcohol
and
once
you
get
by
the
first
few
swallows
and
that
corn
taste
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
a
good
beer
if
you
want
a
good
buzz
cheap
not
to
shabby
for
its
style
presentation
packaged
in
a
40
ounce
clear
glass
bottle
with
a
screw
cap
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
for
a
40
it
could
be
worse
your
typical
malt
beverage
orange
color
not
much
head
to
speak
of
smells
a
little
rancid
but
you
can
tell
theres
actually
some
toasted
malt
in
there
or
some
sort
of
cheap
immitaion
malt
or
someting
i
dont
know
how
they
do
it
and
i
dont
really
care
taste
is
a
little
less
pukey
than
the
smell
but
really
isnt
appetizing
my
friends
convinced
me
to
pound
this
big
boy
last
night
and
on
one
other
occasion
this
summer
and
both
times
ive
woken
up
extremely
hung
over
this
stuff
is
bad
for
you
only
drink
it
if
youre
in
9th
grade
word
pours
gold
with
a
thick
3
finger
head
that
slowly
evaporates
with
little
to
no
lacing
the
only
thing
to
say
about
taste
and
smell
is
overpowering
cider
if
not
for
the
that
it
might
have
a
decent
mouthfeel
and
drinkabilty
suprisingly
smooth
for
the
high
gravity
if
you
like
your
cheap
buzz
drowned
in
ester
this
is
the
best
1
79
you
can
spend
taste
was
grainy
with
a
lemon
hint
the
alcohol
was
present
and
left
a
slight
burn
in
the
throat
and
chest
problem
is
at
first
tase
it
wasnt
bad
but
as
you
drink
this
beer
it
seems
to
get
worse
it
was
creamy
and
light
in
the
mouth
and
fairly
drinkable
clear
40
oz
bottle
straw
yellow
in
color
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
when
opened
smell
is
of
corny
skunk
and
a
large
dose
of
alcohol
taste
is
really
dominated
by
the
high
amount
of
alcohol
and
the
cheap
ingredients
that
were
used
to
brew
this
swill
that
is
actually
kind
of
insulting
to
swine
a
cheap
buzz
for
sure
but
will
leave
you
hungover
without
fail
overallquite
possibly
the
worst
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
although
2pac
was
a
great
artist
he
could
have
had
better
choice
in
beer
even
malt
liquor
for
that
matter
picked
this
up
in
new
orleans
just
to
try
something
new
as
with
any
malt
liquor
worth
its
salt
this
was
consumed
in
a
clear
40
oz
color
is
macro
yellow
with
a
medium
fizzy
head
appearance
is
a
little
better
than
some
of
the
malt
liquors
ive
had
smell
is
a
sweeter
variation
of
what
is
usually
expected
from
adjuncts
this
is
the
sweetest
tasting
malt
liquor
ive
had
the
taste
is
okay
at
first
but
the
sweetness
becomes
a
little
too
much
after
a
while
overall
i
consider
this
average
for
a
malt
liquor
it
could
be
better
or
a
lot
worse
basically
if
youre
in
the
market
for
malt
liquor
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
if
youre
in
the
market
for
actual
beer
you
wouldnt
have
read
this
review
now
spill
some
for
the
homies
that
aint
with
us
no
mo
good
lord
this
stuff
is
something
else
poured
out
with
little
head
and
had
a
strong
scent
of
alcohol
and
sugar
the
brew
was
far
too
sweet
for
me
and
left
me
hung
over
less
than
an
hour
and
a
half
later
i
would
go
with
any
other
malt
liquor
unless
you
are
looking
for
a
reason
to
get
a
headache
pretty
darn
good
for
a
malt
liqour
it
has
a
straw
color
that
pours
with
a
nice
creamy
head
that
has
decent
staying
power
it
smells
of
mostly
corn
and
adjuncts
the
taste
is
initially
good
and
smooth
but
quickly
has
some
bite
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
over
carbonated
but
its
nothing
to
be
concerned
about
it
has
good
drinkability
and
is
great
for
getting
drunk
on
due
to
the
high
alcohol
content
i
dont
care
for
many
malt
liqours
but
i
will
probably
get
this
one
again
for
when
i
want
to
get
drunk
i
have
a
40
sitting
here
in
front
of
me
and
it
has
a
mediocre
taste
and
i
doubt
very
much
that
i
will
finish
it
but
not
because
of
the
taste
which
is
passable
for
me
its
the
abv
that
kills
this
product
i
can
feel
the
headache
starting
already
bottom
line
is
nice
buzz
for
the
price
but
no
thanks
i
have
no
need
to
drink
it
again
starts
with
a
soft
malt
then
changes
to
a
not
too
unpleasant
sweet
corn
that
is
just
a
bit
sticky
aftertaste
is
mostly
silky
alcohol
overtones
i
have
been
through
some
real
brewing
alchemists
nightmares
thankfully
st
ides
was
not
one
of
them
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
this
one
is
not
too
bad
poured
in
a
glass
it
looks
great
dark
gold
nice
big
foamy
head
it
doesnt
have
too
much
of
the
obnoxious
adjunct
aroma
that
other
high
gravity
brews
have
either
it
tasted
pretty
sweet
also
which
makes
it
slide
down
rather
smoothly
there
is
nothing
too
harsh
about
this
malt
liquor
other
than
the
alcohol
presence
but
what
the
hell
do
you
drink
malt
liquors
for
anyway
if
you
like
your
buzzmaker
sweet
and
smooth
st
ides
is
the
ticket
otherwise
drink
at
your
own
discretion
and
give
your
car
keys
to
someone
sane
golden
straw
almost
no
head
moderate
carbonation
smells
sweet
with
hint
of
alcohol
and
cooked
corn
somewhat
malty
with
weak
hop
bitterness
that
doesnt
take
your
attention
away
from
the
fact
that
this
beer
tastes
like
stale
corn
on
the
cob
spicy
alochol
quality
decent
to
get
drunk
not
a
good
sippin
brew
not
the
best
malt
liquor
but
does
the
trick
will
eventually
throw
you
on
the
ground
kick
you
a
few
times
then
pee
all
over
you
exactly
what
a
good
malt
liquor
should
do
notes
high
octane
brew
aimed
for
people
that
want
a
quick
and
ugly
buzz
pretty
damn
good
for
what
you
would
expect
in
a
malt
liquor
not
bad
at
1
25
a
pop
but
remember
you
get
what
you
pay
for
oddly
of
the
5
people
who
tried
it
we
all
had
the
same
opinion
it
gives
you
instant
heart
burn
it
is
very
hard
to
finish
even
one
because
its
extreme
sweetness
we
tried
to
chase
it
and
mix
it
but
we
found
the
only
thing
it
tastes
good
with
is
orange
juice
i
gave
it
away
to
a
neighbor
who
loves
those
ritas
and
she
said
it
was
bad
i
would
never
buy
it
again
nor
try
the
other
flavors
because
of
how
bad
it
was
just
not
very
good
kinda
gross
really
too
sweet
o
i
am
making
mexican
dishes
and
thought
what
the
hell
its
okay
for
what
it
is
it
is
awfully
sweet
though
its
refreshing
when
you
dont
have
beer
mmm
alcoholic
koolaid
with
a
light
carbonation
can
sample
from
the
grocery
store
poured
a
fizzy
bright
red
color
beer
with
light
disappearing
head
aroma
of
sweet
cranberry
syrup
smells
nothing
like
beer
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
cranberry
notes
with
have
more
in
similar
with
syrup
than
actual
cranberry
body
is
light
with
spritzy
carbonation
not
sure
how
much
beer
is
really
used
in
this
drinks
this
tastes
like
a
wine
cooler
its
not
beer
but
a
nice
fruity
and
boozy
drink
o
pretty
easy
to
drink
because
it
is
not
quite
a
sweet
as
the
other
rita
products
and
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
not
sure
that
i
would
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
but
it
is
not
offensive
serving
type
can
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentyfive
once
aluminum
can
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
not
good
but
nowhere
near
as
bad
as
i
was
anticipating
this
is
basically
hard
fruit
punchkoolaid
rather
than
beer
so
its
a
bit
hard
to
rate
but
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
yep
add
an
already
barely
tangential
beer
brand
name
to
an
effort
clearly
aimed
at
nonbeerdrinkers
and
what
have
we
oh
right
a
cocktail
one
which
actually
has
a
lot
more
merit
as
a
quaffable
beverage
ya
know
the
fruit
and
the
abv
than
the
base
watereddown
beer
im
still
astounded
at
how
far
abinbev
has
to
take
things
before
ba
treats
them
like
they
do
craft
ciders
decent
for
what
it
is
so
i
got
a
mixpack
and
decided
to
review
these
guys
the
appearance
is
bright
red
with
pink
foam
the
smell
is
all
sugar
with
some
cranberry
and
lime
scents
coming
through
the
taste
was
very
similar
with
so
much
sugar
it
made
my
teeth
hurt
after
a
few
sips
i
found
the
aftertaste
to
be
a
big
turn
off
at
least
the
mouthfeel
was
thin
enough
and
it
wasnt
too
syrupy
the
loud
crack
told
me
that
it
had
not
lost
any
of
its
carbonation
since
i
initially
bought
it
but
given
that
there
was
going
to
be
25
fl
oz
of
it
the
glug
would
not
be
inverted
watching
it
pour
into
my
glass
caused
me
to
involuntarily
let
out
a
guffaw
of
laughter
it
was
magenta
omfg
it
fizzed
like
soda
pop
quickly
reducing
its
head
to
nothingness
leaving
me
with
a
glass
filled
with
what
i
can
only
describe
as
looking
like
beet
juice
srm
na
but
with
great
clarity
it
did
not
smell
like
beet
juice
however
it
smelled
like
cranberry
jelly
on
the
table
at
thanksgiving
at
my
maternal
grummys
house
every
year
when
i
was
growing
up
i
just
could
not
help
but
laugh
again
it
is
very
difficult
to
take
a
beer
such
as
this
seriously
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
fizzy
very
much
like
soda
pop
more
laughter
the
taste
was
very
tart
very
much
like
cranberry
and
with
the
addition
of
lime
it
was
like
drinking
alum
i
do
not
think
that
i
will
be
playing
the
trumpet
right
after
i
am
done
with
this
my
lips
were
puckered
harder
than
last
summer
when
the
old
lady
put
me
on
an
eastbound
train
possibly
out
of
her
life
forever
oh
no
this
beer
is
causing
melancholia
to
set
in
and
there
was
no
warning
on
the
label
finish
was
reminiscent
of
a
sweetart
candy
it
had
both
a
sweetness
and
a
tartness
with
the
emphasis
on
tart
it
was
not
awful
as
it
seems
to
be
currently
rated
but
neither
was
it
something
that
i
would
want
to
drink
a
second
time
it
was
like
fizzy
ocean
spray
cranberry
juice
cocktail
ha
ha
ha
oi
think
this
is
what
they
were
trying
to
produce
and
they
did
a
nice
job
pours
a
purplishred
in
color
with
a
very
small
head
that
goes
away
in
like
a
minute
no
lacing
was
seen
slightly
above
average
carbonation
the
aroma
is
of
faint
cranberries
with
a
hint
of
lime
but
no
grains
the
taste
wasnt
too
great
like
a
cheap
cranberry
juice
cocktail
with
some
grain
alcohol
added
no
beer
taste
at
all
on
the
tart
side
as
would
be
excepted
if
i
wanted
a
margarita
i
would
make
one
i
guess
why
i
am
really
disappointed
is
because
i
was
hoping
for
some
kind
of
beer
taste
there
was
none
it
is
like
a
smoothie
that
has
alcohol
in
it
and
even
that
was
a
disappointment
you
cant
taste
the
alcohol
i
get
where
they
get
brrr
rita
from
trying
to
compare
it
to
a
margarita
however
i
think
it
should
just
be
called
bud
light
smoothie
lime
oless
syrupy
sweet
than
other
beverages
in
this
category
reminded
me
less
of
a
margarita
and
more
like
a
cranberryvodka
drink
w
lime
repeat
purchase
is
highly
unlikely
despite
the
ease
at
which
this
beverage
can
be
consumed
overall
i
can
give
props
to
flavor
for
really
nailing
the
cranberry
taste
this
tastes
like
actual
cranberry
juice
with
a
little
bit
of
sugar
carbonation
and
of
course
alcohol
mixed
in
not
terribly
sweet
like
the
other
ritas
but
also
not
really
a
beer
an
interesting
and
not
bad
flavor
for
the
holidays
tastes
more
like
that
pre
mixed
soda
syrup
than
alcohol
neon
orange
with
absolutely
no
head
at
all
smell
matches
the
taste
very
syrupy
and
sticky
in
the
mouth
will
need
to
brush
teeth
as
soon
as
you
finish
to
get
the
feeling
out
of
your
mouth
pours
out
with
no
head
retention
bright
orange
in
color
smells
like
sweet
mango
candy
taste
just
like
the
smell
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
light
carb
overall
its
whatever
looks
great
like
all
their
flavored
beer
they
over
did
the
flavor
it
is
drinkable
but
would
be
better
mixed
with
other
beer
fave
of
the
rita
line
so
far
great
mango
taste
good
with
some
pineapple
and
sprite
to
make
a
quick
drink
overall
just
make
your
own
margaritas
overall
2
13
so
far
only
the
second
worst
in
the
four
oritas
ive
tried
the
best
one
is
raspberry
then
strawberry
then
mango
and
worst
of
all
is
the
original
lime
they
managed
to
not
screw
this
one
up
too
bad
and
now
that
ive
got
a
taste
of
about
2
oz
i
will
drain
the
rest
good
for
a
review
little
else
this
beer
alone
taste
like
a
mango
flavored
jolly
rancher
candy
its
too
sweet
and
gives
me
a
headache
after
just
one
however
the
alcohol
content
is
at
8
which
is
pretty
high
for
a
beer
i
use
this
beer
to
turn
dry
wines
into
a
sweet
bubbly
for
this
reason
alone
i
give
it
a
3
0
mangorita
pours
an
orange
color
with
absolutely
no
head
there
is
a
crazy
sweet
aroma
very
sugary
some
mango
juice
like
flavors
the
taste
is
very
fizzy
very
very
sweet
and
sugary
some
slight
artificial
flavors
too
fizzy
bad
feel
overall
very
sweet
artificial
mango
flavors
not
very
good
overall
at
first
it
might
have
ranked
with
the
razberrita
after
a
few
sips
though
its
high
sweetness
and
lack
of
tartness
make
this
thing
kind
of
hard
to
drink
overall
terrible
way
to
sweet
to
drink
unlike
the
other
bud
light
lime
rita
drinks
this
one
seems
a
little
bit
too
sweet
its
just
too
full
of
mango
flavor
and
sugary
sweetness
and
without
any
tartness
to
balance
it
on
the
label
it
suggest
that
you
try
mixing
it
with
ice
and
id
agree
as
that
might
help
to
water
it
down
a
bit
on
the
other
hand
it
does
taste
completely
of
mango
and
if
thats
what
youre
looking
for
this
does
the
trick
i
cant
recommend
it
as
a
beer
nor
can
i
really
recommend
it
as
a
malternative
either
but
to
everything
its
own
place
and
season
it
seemed
more
like
a
strong
wine
cooler
than
anything
pours
a
bright
orange
color
with
little
foam
smells
mostly
of
artificial
fruit
and
alcohol
taste
was
extremely
sweet
with
only
artificial
flavors
coming
though
wasnt
a
fan
my
brother
wanted
some
bud
light
from
a
nearby
7eleven
i
wanted
something
this
one
was
one
of
the
very
few
newtome
things
so
yeah
this
stuff
pours
a
partlyhazy
ecto
cooler
seriously
throughout
my
entire
childhood
i
thought
the
cooler
was
a
bright
green
inside
of
those
cardboard
boxes
alas
my
wrongness
topped
by
a
halffinger
at
best
of
some
incredibly
transitory
dirty
khaki
bubble
mist
the
nose
is
dominated
by
sweet
mango
syrup
though
i
think
i
get
some
lime
juice
somewhere
in
there
as
well
could
just
be
wishful
thinking
the
taste
mostly
confirms
the
mango
domination
but
now
there
undoubtedly
is
a
small
bite
of
tartish
lime
in
the
background
honestly
this
aint
half
bad
so
long
as
you
like
these
flavors
in
a
heavily
sweet
context
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
rather
sodalike
feel
overall
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
by
far
but
something
not
all
that
bad
for
a
straight
alcoholdelivery
service
sourcing
purchased
at
walmart
in
texas
in
july
of
2013
for
1
00
for
a
single
eightounce
can
once
more
i
got
a
loud
crack
but
given
that
there
was
going
to
be
25
fl
oz
of
it
the
glug
would
not
be
inverted
this
time
it
was
orange
soda
pop
i
would
find
it
laughable
if
abinbev
was
not
marketing
this
malt
beverage
as
something
to
be
taken
seriously
any
head
that
was
produced
quickly
fizzled
out
and
simply
sparkled
like
pop
color
was
a
slightlyhazy
neon
orange
srm
na
more
like
glowing
nuclear
waste
on
another
topic
is
mango
the
new
black
it
seems
to
be
appearing
in
a
lot
of
beers
lately
but
i
can
only
hope
that
papaya
is
not
far
behind
nose
smelled
sort
of
like
mango
but
in
a
candylike
way
not
a
natural
scent
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
but
with
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
reinforcing
the
whole
soda
pop
analogy
gad
but
this
was
really
sweet
much
more
that
the
previous
two
ritas
which
had
some
tartness
to
them
i
closed
my
eyes
and
swore
that
i
was
drinking
pop
this
was
not
going
to
be
on
my
hit
parade
lemme
tell
ya
finish
was
cloying
and
sweet
as
all
getout
ugh
i
have
my
annual
physical
tomorrow
and
i
hope
this
does
not
give
me
diabetes
o
the
mango
flavors
completely
obscure
the
taste
of
the
underlying
beer
but
when
you
consider
that
this
is
bud
light
this
might
not
necessarily
be
considered
a
bad
thing
its
definitely
a
lot
more
drinkable
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
especially
if
you
drink
it
cold
overall
incredibly
artificial
and
is
nowhere
even
close
to
being
beer
that
said
though
its
not
offensive
and
it
works
for
what
it
is
o
this
is
not
unenjoyable
but
it
tastes
nothing
like
beer
more
like
a
mango
soda
than
anything
else
and
of
all
of
the
bud
light
lime
xxxaritas
this
is
probably
my
favorite
easy
to
drink
on
a
warm
afternoon
evening
and
pairs
nicely
with
spicy
food
o
i
like
mangoes
so
this
isnt
that
hateful
for
me
i
wish
i
would
have
purchased
an
eight
ounce
can
instead
the
sweetness
is
a
bit
overwhelming
after
awhile
not
to
mention
this
in
mo
way
resembles
one
of
my
beloved
malt
liquors
snagged
this
as
a
what
the
hell
because
i
was
already
ripped
and
it
was
2
50
not
really
a
beer
but
tasty
difficult
to
rate
but
congrats
bud
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
this
again
which
is
what
they
are
going
for
but
this
is
not
a
beer
as
a
drink
it
is
certainly
something
i
would
have
again
but
not
as
a
beer
if
you
enjoy
orange
soda
with
a
splash
of
orange
dimetapp
this
is
your
joint
tastes
like
sweet
artificial
orange
mango
soda
with
that
woozy
medicinal
alcoholic
note
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
blehhh
fizzy
and
sweet
mimics
orange
soda
all
too
well
cant
even
taste
the
lime
from
the
alleged
bud
light
lime
addition
oh
well
there
is
noticeable
cheap
mango
flavor
here
though
its
not
terrible
for
what
it
is
but
youd
better
be
drinking
it
on
the
rocks
at
some
touristy
hotel
if
you
still
want
to
respect
yourself
in
the
morning
does
this
taste
bad
nope
does
it
taste
like
something
thrown
together
late
in
a
party
when
all
you
have
left
are
the
potential
ingredients
for
a
mixed
drink
so
you
make
with
it
and
generally
enjoy
yourselves
sure
on
the
other
hand
is
this
beer
de
ninguna
manera
poured
from
a
25
oz
can
has
an
orangegolden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
with
mangos
lots
of
aroma
taste
is
sweet
lots
of
mango
alcohol
is
well
hidden
a
refreshing
change
of
pace
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
pours
a
orangesoda
in
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
seen
at
all
the
aroma
is
of
a
artificial
mangopeach
puree
no
beer
smell
at
all
either
the
taste
is
better
than
the
aroma
but
not
by
much
kind
of
sugary
and
a
tad
bit
syrupy
as
well
lots
of
carbonation
overall
not
real
impressed
with
this
one
at
all
though
their
razzorita
was
better
than
the
other
few
flavors
i
tried
in
this
line
bud
light
lime
mangorita
35
looks
like
a
carbonated
orange
soda
or
gatorade
head
light
colored
peach
falls
flat
quick
as
the
8
ounce
can
of
8
bud
light
lime
mang0rita
is
poured
aromatics
like
a
tropical
mango
explosion
candle
very
perfume
like
with
fusel
alcohol
notes
this
is
pretty
crude
the
last
time
i
had
a
mango
margarita
i
was
in
ensenada
mexico
and
i
earned
myself
a
case
of
montezumas
revenge
for
steering
away
from
cerveza
i
assure
you
that
ab
has
better
quality
control
than
the
cantinas
of
that
coastal
community
on
the
baja
peninsula
god
awful
sugars
collide
with
medicinal
mango
tropical
acid
reflux
in
a
can
this
is
horrible
im
done
with
abuse
for
today
wow
the
mild
salty
finish
will
put
you
over
the
top
if
you
think
your
a
man
tango
with
this
mangorita
mouthfeel
is
cloying
diabetes
inducing
sweetness
please
america
stop
recommending
new
variations
of
the
same
old
shit
this
is
bad
overall
im
thinking
about
trying
the
other
version
i
saw
at
the
gas
station
just
for
shits
and
giggles
the
day
after
consumption
i
suppose
once
they
lowered
the
abv
to
normalish
adult
beverage
levels
the
fruity
malt
liquor
associations
kind
of
drop
off
anyways
still
not
really
a
beer
the
raspberry
component
completely
obliterating
any
bud
light
sic
graininess
more
evidence
that
bud
light
is
more
brand
name
than
actual
beer
amazingly
not
awful
could
go
really
well
with
a
desert
such
as
a
cheesecake
not
too
sure
how
to
rate
this
one
though
since
it
is
not
really
a
beer
tickles
my
tastebuds
soooo
yummy
typical
bud
beer
cheap
price
cheap
tasting
way
too
sweet
i
couldnt
take
it
i
try
to
rate
beers
to
style
this
is
really
a
malt
beverage
or
alcopop
not
beer
as
such
its
not
bad
for
what
it
is
and
makes
a
nice
change
from
beer
it
pours
a
purple
color
with
a
minimal
white
head
from
a
ten
ounce
can
the
smell
is
sweet
and
has
some
raspberry
notes
the
flavor
is
on
the
sweet
side
but
definitely
tastes
like
raspberry
its
decent
if
this
is
what
you
are
looking
for
but
it
doesnt
really
resemble
beer
overall
3
23
i
like
this
beer
its
actually
a
margarita
in
a
can
and
i
think
ab
needed
to
market
it
under
a
brand
name
that
would
sell
so
they
slapped
bud
light
on
the
can
and
called
it
good
its
nothing
at
all
like
a
bud
light
and
pretty
much
nothing
at
all
like
a
beer
for
what
it
is
it
tastes
great
but
if
beer
advocate
has
these
things
on
here
they
might
as
well
start
adding
smirnoff
and
mikes
to
the
list
of
reviewed
products
as
this
is
not
a
beer
i
dont
quite
know
how
to
rate
this
i
enjoy
it
so
i
guess
ill
rate
it
how
i
want
overall
still
an
alcopop
not
a
beer
but
drinkable
i
have
to
imagine
that
i
am
on
a
boat
or
something
overall
the
best
of
the
rita
series
i
am
not
sure
that
is
saying
much
but
this
is
the
one
of
the
series
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
at
a
party
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
pours
a
bright
red
with
pink
foam
the
smell
was
alcohol
and
artificial
fruit
very
sweet
taste
with
a
syrupy
mouthfeel
which
made
the
aftertaste
last
way
too
long
that
damn
mango
version
a
few
days
ago
gave
me
a
taste
for
the
other
flavors
so
raspberry
it
is
tonight
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
fuchsia
topped
by
a
minor
wisp
of
transitory
dirtytan
bubble
foam
the
nose
comprises
sweet
raspberry
syrup
undercut
by
a
few
twists
of
lime
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
the
lime
juice
really
only
adding
a
bit
of
tartness
to
the
proceedings
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
sodalike
feel
overall
not
much
to
say
here
its
tasty
enough
to
me
as
i
like
the
sweeter
sodalike
flavors
its
nothing
special
nor
truly
praiseworthy
in
any
way
but
it
gets
the
job
done
in
an
alcoholdelivery
sense
razberrita
pours
a
reddish
purplish
color
with
no
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
there
is
a
very
sweet
smell
that
smells
like
a
chemical
factory
the
taste
has
a
very
strange
fake
chemical
raspberry
flavor
with
hints
of
cheap
beer
trying
to
come
through
flat
and
while
prominent
flavors
they
are
bad
overall
its
chemically
and
rather
fake
avoid
o
the
berry
flavors
completely
obscure
the
taste
of
the
underlying
beer
but
when
you
consider
that
this
is
bud
light
this
might
not
necessarily
be
considered
a
bad
thing
it
starts
to
become
a
little
cloying
as
the
beer
warms
up
so
this
beer
is
something
that
is
best
drank
cold
or
chilled
with
ice
once
more
i
got
a
loud
crack
but
given
that
there
was
going
to
be
25
fl
oz
of
it
the
glug
would
not
be
inverted
this
must
be
a
joke
right
if
cran
was
magenta
then
this
was
definitely
raspberry
it
fizzed
in
the
glass
like
soda
pop
making
a
fizzy
twofingered
head
of
deep
purple
before
taking
a
bow
and
fading
into
obscurity
i
was
left
with
a
glass
filled
with
fizzing
popping
liquid
defying
me
to
cantinue
nose
smelled
of
artificial
raspberry
like
kiddie
candy
which
was
entirely
disappointing
i
miss
my
paternal
grummy
and
her
raspberry
bushes
which
smelled
as
fragrant
and
enticing
in
the
summer
as
anything
that
i
can
remember
this
smelled
like
a
travesty
color
was
a
deep
purple
srm
na
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
thin
but
fizzy
reinforcing
the
idea
of
soda
pop
the
flavor
was
that
same
artificial
raspberry
taste
that
i
garnered
from
the
nose
better
drinking
from
the
chem
lab
i
suppose
but
i
may
not
have
been
their
target
audience
i
was
not
going
to
stoop
to
adding
ice
as
i
could
not
see
how
that
would
help
but
it
needed
help
and
in
no
small
way
man
this
was
sickeningly
sweet
and
much
too
close
to
soda
pop
for
comfort
finish
was
sweet
fruity
and
just
not
my
bag
o
it
is
overtly
sweet
and
highly
carbonated
bud
light
lime
razberrita
brewed
by
anheuserbusch
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
purple
color
with
no
head
you
smell
the
raspberry
and
that
is
about
it
as
far
as
the
taste
it
is
raspberry
not
much
for
a
brew
but
it
goes
down
nice
and
smooth
this
brew
is
a
good
for
the
summer
time
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
of
5
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
i
will
buy
this
again
to
switch
it
up
from
the
mainstream
brews
out
there
on
the
market
o
overall
this
is
a
beer
for
people
that
do
not
like
the
taste
or
smell
of
beer
the
fact
that
it
is
made
from
bud
light
lime
is
almost
completely
hidden
too
sweet
for
my
taste
but
it
is
not
offensive
poured
from
a
25
oz
can
has
a
purple
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
full
of
raspberry
goodness
taste
is
raspberries
sweet
just
a
touch
of
tartness
alcohol
well
hidden
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
i
wouldnt
want
a
steady
diet
of
it
this
wasnt
all
that
bad
nothing
can
prepare
you
for
the
color
of
barney
the
dinosaur
in
a
glass
barely
noticeable
fleeting
pink
head
dwindles
quicker
than
a
fart
in
the
wind
aroma
reminds
me
of
the
flavor
of
a
warhead
sour
candy
blue
raspberry
with
default
berry
notes
and
some
alcoholic
medicinal
qualities
even
over
ice
i
dont
see
how
it
would
help
this
razberrita
wow
the
madness
has
to
stop
but
im
sure
somebody
out
there
enjoys
this
type
of
abuse
different
strokes
for
different
folks
harsh
ass
fusel
alcohol
finish
amongst
the
mild
salted
berry
concentrated
sugar
notes
headache
inducing
almost
instantly
puts
a
smile
on
my
face
to
know
that
i
will
never
walk
down
the
path
of
canned
bud
light
lime
concoctions
lemmings
have
gone
which
has
one
ultimate
outcome
a
direct
path
toward
a
black
out
drinking
session
or
worse
diabetes
induced
coma
which
also
leads
to
a
black
out
in
a
roundabout
way
mouthfeel
makes
your
acid
reflux
come
out
of
hibernation
and
burn
your
ears
for
consuming
something
this
putrid
gag
reflex
inducing
carbonated
man
made
liquids
combine
to
form
this
shit
overall
i
would
never
guide
anybody
toward
this
path
of
enlightenment
or
eternal
black
out
for
that
matter
pours
a
red
wine
in
pour
with
really
no
head
or
lacing
to
speak
of
the
aroma
is
of
raspberries
of
course
with
some
sweeteners
the
taste
is
the
same
with
good
raspberry
flavor
coming
through
with
a
hint
of
ol
bud
lime
at
the
end
i
liked
it
better
than
their
cranberrita
i
tried
a
couple
of
months
ago
overall
it
wasnt
bad
not
sure
how
to
review
tastes
like
a
bad
cidersoda
mix
abysmal
do
not
drink
this
its
ok
typical
bud
beer
overall
id
say
go
with
any
of
the
other
flavors
in
the
product
line
unless
the
idea
of
a
cheap
high
gravity
macro
apple
cider
appeals
to
you
just
like
all
of
the
secondary
budlightlimeahhritas
this
is
just
another
version
of
a
malternative
that
doesnt
really
go
anywhere
its
decent
enough
if
you
want
a
sweet
apple
flavored
cocktail
o
way
too
sweet
and
way
too
artificial
flavored
for
my
enjoyment
all
i
can
think
is
that
this
is
the
liquid
version
of
the
almost
neon
green
jolly
rancher
candies
alcohol
is
covered
by
the
sweetness
pours
a
reddishyellow
in
color
with
no
head
to
speak
of
as
well
as
no
lacing
seen
lots
of
sweet
apple
aroma
for
the
most
part
almost
seemed
artificial
even
pretty
much
the
same
with
the
taste
as
it
was
more
like
apple
juice
with
some
ever
clear
than
anything
else
lots
of
sugar
and
pretty
sweet
lighter
bodied
with
heavy
carbonation
overall
it
was
just
ok
and
if
i
wanted
a
similar
drink
it
would
be
some
hard
cider
than
this
a
one
time
try
for
me
serving
type
can
admittedly
i
was
looking
to
find
the
cranberry
version
when
i
perused
the
cooler
at
my
local
7eleven
but
how
could
i
say
no
to
this
one
especially
when
crannie
didnt
even
bother
to
show
up
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
brassrusset
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
very
shortlived
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
sugary
apple
cider
a
hint
of
maple
syrup
and
a
kiss
of
hard
water
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
and
i
swear
i
can
get
an
ethereal
smidgen
of
that
eponymous
lime
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
an
active
carbonation
and
a
slick
sodalike
feel
overall
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
beverage
i
may
not
frequent
these
fruity
ritas
but
i
could
see
drinking
another
of
these
even
if
it
does
rub
me
the
wrong
way
a
bit
by
feeling
an
awful
lot
like
a
soda
bud
light
lime
apple
ahhh
rita
brewed
by
anheuser
busch
with
an
abv
of
8
0
this
brew
pours
out
a
dark
amber
color
with
no
head
there
are
smell
white
bubbles
but
no
head
the
smell
is
apple
and
beer
that
is
all
you
get
in
the
smell
of
this
brew
the
taste
is
sweet
but
smooth
there
is
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
this
is
one
of
the
better
lime
ahh
rita
brews
on
the
market
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
75
out
of
5
i
would
get
this
brew
again
i
love
it
too
bad
this
finicky
site
wont
let
me
post
an
actual
photo
of
the
product
the
alcohol
content
is
8
and
you
can
buy
a
25oz
can
for
about
2
50
simplified
thats
like
2
regular
sized
cans
it
tastes
just
like
apple
juice
with
a
punch
but
you
really
dont
notice
it
so
be
careful
a
couple
of
these
on
an
empty
stomach
will
get
you
tipsy
to
say
the
least
for
those
of
you
who
like
sweet
wines
hard
ciders
or
if
youre
a
girl
who
likes
fruity
drink
this
is
a
good
option
25
ounce
cans
of
diabetes
inducing
sweetness
this
beer
will
give
you
a
toothache
its
candied
malt
liquor
with
apple
flavor
and
caramel
color
this
version
is
especially
harsh
no
add
fizzy
carbonation
explodes
if
you
pour
it
into
a
glass
and
never
settles
smells
like
medicinal
apple
maybe
a
bit
of
spice
if
you
imagine
this
is
their
fall
seasonal
flavor
the
first
sip
induces
acid
reflux
fusel
alcohol
finishes
all
medicinal
i
cant
believe
someone
would
drink
the
whole
can
unless
they
have
a
death
wish
mouthfeel
is
harsh
gag
inducing
with
each
sip
so
acidic
unnatural
on
all
levels
its
probably
good
for
marinating
tough
meat
or
making
seviche
overall
the
redds
wicked
apple
ale
i
had
prior
was
as
smooth
as
fine
champagne
compared
to
this
rotgut
malt
liquor
with
a
mask
on
imagine
the
hangover
from
this
stuff
appleahhhrita
pours
a
reddish
color
with
a
very
small
head
lots
of
bubbles
there
is
a
stale
apple
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
sugary
and
has
some
apple
flavors
weaker
body
over
carbonated
and
sugary
overall
its
like
apple
juice
with
too
much
sugar
appleahhhrita
isnt
so
much
what
i
expected
in
terms
of
flavor
but
also
nothing
too
surprising
especially
for
a
line
of
drinks
that
has
been
capable
of
impressing
me
quite
significantly
the
flavor
is
there
if
one
can
look
past
the
detractors
the
carbonation
and
the
overbearing
sweetness
bring
and
one
can
should
give
many
a
light
buzz
or
a
pretty
warm
feeling
inside
but
there
are
better
offerings
from
the
same
line
and
i
cant
say
im
soulcrushed
that
the
flavor
is
just
a
seasonal
item
after
all
if
sales
for
this
beverage
play
like
they
did
for
the
cranbrrrrita
well
still
see
this
on
store
shelves
in
november
and
december
h
o
r
r
i
b
l
e
ok
lets
face
it
malt
liquor
is
not
a
good
nor
classy
beer
but
we
all
remember
high
school
i
gave
this
ghettowhite
trash
beer
a
high
review
for
exactly
what
it
is
in
its
own
league
fuckin
awesome
looks
like
piss
kinda
smells
like
it
with
notes
of
dank
malts
grains
and
crackers
taste
is
about
the
same
without
as
much
of
that
malt
liquor
funk
like
steel
reserve
which
in
positive
is
the
worse
thing
in
planet
earth
other
than
shiner
holliday
chear
come
on
people
if
you
got
1
39
to
spare
get
rocked
by
the
hurricane
wind
up
flashlight
check
matches
check
toilet
paper
check
now
all
you
need
it
some
way
drown
your
sorrows
due
to
the
fact
that
college
students
and
the
federal
government
got
the
day
off
and
you
just
finished
swimming
home
from
the
office
look
no
farther
than
hurricane
premium
malt
beverage
no
screaming
endorsements
here
but
it
gets
the
job
done
and
isnt
that
what
life
is
all
about
overall
this
brew
isnt
awful
i
have
no
problem
killing
the
forty
bud
ice
forty
though
is
another
story
i
gave
this
beer
its
fair
shake
i
know
what
it
is
sometimes
i
like
to
spend
2
50
on
a
single
forty
ounce
this
brew
is
worth
a
shot
its
got
a
kick
its
got
a
kick
its
got
a
kick
its
got
a
kick
o
ill
openly
admit
that
ive
like
this
stuff
for
a
long
time
i
used
to
think
it
was
just
king
cobra
in
a
different
package
but
they
are
totally
different
animals
this
is
a
malt
liquor
after
all
inexpensive
and
gets
the
job
done
frankly
i
have
always
wondered
why
regular
bmc
drinkers
dont
go
for
this
stuff
since
i
think
it
tastes
better
than
bud
or
bl
and
packs
a
decent
punch
while
my
rating
may
seem
high
remember
that
this
is
malt
liquor
people
drink
malt
liquor
for
two
reasons
its
cheap
and
it
gets
you
ripped
i
dont
really
know
of
any
malt
liquor
that
is
truly
a
pleasant
drink
but
given
price
abv
and
smoothness
hurricane
is
the
best
malt
liquor
available
imo
you
can
still
get
a
40oz
for
under
3
in
many
places
and
because
of
this
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
buzz
you
can
afford
an
extra
to
pour
out
for
your
homies
mouthfeel
is
okay
as
is
smell
the
appearance
is
what
youd
expect
not
tremendous
but
not
bad
either
overall
now
listed
at
6
abv
this
is
a
cheap
accessible
and
easy
to
consume
beverage
its
alot
more
of
a
beer
than
the
fruit
infused
lagers
taking
over
the
market
these
days
id
stick
with
this
over
many
of
the
lime
or
berry
infused
alternatives
especially
when
money
becomes
tight
you
can
do
much
worse
sadly
ocheap
malt
liquor
definitely
will
not
be
seeking
it
out
again
this
was
surprisingly
easy
to
drink
and
not
at
all
unpleasant
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
40
you
could
do
lot
worse
than
grabbing
one
of
these
overall
its
not
a
terrible
malt
liquor
its
decent
for
the
style
its
alright
not
very
rough
for
a
malt
liquor
but
not
something
you
would
want
to
drink
alot
of
this
is
an
entry
level
malt
but
a
good
one
at
that
ive
youve
only
ever
had
magnum
then
you
are
in
for
a
treat
with
this
otherwise
its
basic
but
good
basic
overall
not
really
the
best
malt
out
there
with
the
price
of
this
40
oz
at
only
at
2
25
what
should
i
expect
though
right
overall
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
malt
liquor
avoid
this
and
get
a
mickeys
im
not
going
to
lie
to
you
and
tell
you
that
it
is
a
good
beer
it
is
medium
to
light
in
body
sweet
decent
finish
mild
vegetal
finish
flat
on
the
palate
it
is
an
adult
soda
not
great
but
something
to
do
while
your
baby
finally
sleeps
cheap
and
not
great
but
i
did
drink
it
probably
wont
bother
again
though
drank
this
because
what
else
should
i
drink
for
hurricane
ilene
in
philly
bought
a
40
at
the
corner
store
big
clear
glass
bottle
hell
no
i
didnt
use
a
glass
its
a
40
bright
yellow
with
white
foam
that
sits
on
the
top
looks
just
like
i
expect
a
malt
liquor
to
look
aroma
is
skunky
right
off
the
bat
clear
glass
does
nothing
positive
for
beer
some
grainyness
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
but
the
skunk
overwhelms
the
taste
is
meh
light
and
watery
nothing
special
but
nothing
too
offensive
either
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
really
not
a
bad
beer
its
malt
liquor
cheap
and
inoffensive
this
is
one
of
the
tougher
challenges
to
choke
down
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
foamy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
slightly
sweet
grainy
and
ricy
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
grainy
with
some
rice
notes
lightmedium
body
a
nice
looking
macro
but
not
worth
the
money
had
during
a
halloween
party
that
a
friend
was
having
someone
brought
several
of
these
along
for
some
reason
i
poured
myself
a
glass
and
off
i
went
it
was
about
as
pointless
of
a
beer
as
anything
i
can
remember
no
head
kinda
smooth
but
no
flavor
still
havent
found
a
good
tasting
40
yet
1000
am
on
a
thursday
at
only
1
79
just
after
my
wife
and
i
got
into
a
bad
fight
seemed
like
the
thing
to
do
at
the
time
looked
a
bit
darker
than
most
light
lagers
they
lady
on
the
other
end
of
the
800
assured
me
there
was
no
hfcs
smelled
pretty
sweet
wth
a
little
alcohol
tasted
too
sweet
but
went
down
pretty
easy
could
have
downed
anouther
if
i
hadnt
had
anything
else
to
do
today
i
agree
with
most
dont
drink
it
unless
you
need
a
cheap
buzz
very
pale
pour
i
think
this
might
be
the
lightest
of
the
malts
i
have
tried
over
the
last
week
with
the
same
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
almost
instantly
though
the
ever
present
streams
of
carbonation
all
seem
to
still
be
coming
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
aroma
is
corn
alcohol
and
a
mess
of
wet
hay
just
not
what
you
want
to
come
home
to
this
follows
over
to
the
flavor
almost
exactly
as
it
was
just
all
over
the
place
but
maintained
that
almost
day
old
bread
like
taste
mixed
with
astringent
alcohol
and
moldy
cereal
slick
feel
and
just
an
almost
gag
inducing
aftertaste
just
not
built
for
this
one
at
all
dave
very
cheap
dont
have
to
plug
your
nose
to
get
it
down
and
its
pretty
cheap
do
not
mind
gettin
one
of
these
down
and
it
keeps
my
pockets
thick
call
me
crazy
but
id
say
this
is
better
than
most
shit
beers
did
i
mention
that
its
quite
inexpensive
presentation
packaged
in
a
forty
ounce
clear
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
md
mouthfeel
of
sparkling
water
and
the
only
reason
it
is
drinkable
is
because
it
tastes
so
much
like
water
d
i
wouldnt
really
drink
this
again
except
for
memories
even
then
i
would
have
to
beer
pong
it
seemingly
par
for
the
malt
liquor
course
i
got
two
fingers
worth
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
that
fell
like
they
had
been
struck
from
behind
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
faintly
fusel
compared
to
many
that
i
have
put
away
on
this
hosedup
mission
the
style
is
designed
to
knock
you
around
on
the
cheap
and
i
said
as
much
to
a
fellow
yesterday
when
he
commented
on
my
choice
stopping
only
when
i
noticed
that
he
had
some
in
his
cart
whoops
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
dryness
that
left
me
sucking
for
air
wow
finish
was
equally
dry
with
a
slight
fusel
flavor
that
lingered
frankly
this
was
not
as
obnoxious
as
many
offerings
in
the
style
from
the
24
fl
oz
can
10112nb44
sampled
on
june

2010
everything
about
this
is
typical
for
an
adjunct
high
gravity
malt
liquor
although
not
carried
off
as
well
as
some
it
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
little
thin
white
head
that
dissolves
right
away
while
there
are
malt
hints
in
the
aroma
the
main
smell
i
get
is
metal
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
but
the
taste
has
a
bit
of
corn
and
malts
but
the
alcohol
remains
the
most
predominant
ingredient
rjt
but
since
i
am
not
sophisticated
i
will
stick
with
mickeys
or
olde
e
i
tend
to
not
want
to
try
beers
of
this
caliber
so
my
rating
might
be
skewered
a
bit
towards
the
low
side
but
what
can
i
say
this
was
some
pretty
terrible
stuff
d
not
the
worst
malt
liquor
i
can
think
of
but
it
really
is
more
a
case
of
worse
than
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
just
not
something
that
invites
you
to
drink
more
of
it
d
this
as
good
as
i
had
anticipated
not
very
i
cant
imagine
drinking
an
entire
40
of
this
to
quote
bubbles
you
can
barely
get
er
in
ya
but
my
fuck
itll
get
you
some
drunk
go
figure
40
oz
isnt
one
of
the
serving
type
choices
on
the
dropdown
menu
anyway
anyone
who
picks
this
up
pretty
much
knows
what
theyre
in
for
its
yellow
and
fizzy
the
only
real
distinction
between
this
and
other
malt
liquors
is
that
it
tastes
even
more
like
old
boiled
corn
than
most
and
has
a
slightly
higher
alcohol
content
the
tradeoff
is
obvious
and
people
who
have
nothing
left
to
live
for
should
almost
certainly
grab
this
brand
of
liverdestroying
quasibeer
the
only
problem
with
this
is
that
its
hard
to
observe
brand
loyalty
when
the
brand
in
question
makes
you
throw
up
on
your
friends
a
little
bit
quicker
poured
from
a
clear
40
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smells
of
malts
slightly
sweet
taste
is
basically
of
malts
and
corn
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
not
that
bad
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
keeping
in
mind
this
is
a
malt
liquor
i
didnt
hold
out
much
hope
for
it
that
being
said
i
know
i
didnt
rate
it
very
high
but
it
was
better
then
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
its
no
where
near
as
harsh
as
steel
reserve
which
is
probably
the
nastiest
of
malt
liquors
out
there
poured
into
o
pint
glass
its
plae
yellow
in
color
with
a
whole
lot
of
foam
it
has
a
sweetness
in
the
taste
thats
kind
of
appealing
all
in
all
no
where
near
a
great
beer
but
if
pay
day
is
ways
of
and
you
want
something
cheap
to
get
the
job
done
this
will
do
it
hurricane
high
gravity
lager
was
pale
gold
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
large
white
head
that
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
light
and
clean
just
a
generic
beer
smell
there
was
not
much
flavor
to
speak
of
but
what
what
was
there
was
not
good
it
was
somewhat
sweet
upfront
with
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
light
and
watery
with
lighter
than
expected
carbonation
drinkability
was
not
good
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
will
purchase
again
maybe
the
regular
version
would
be
better
im
not
really
sure
why
i
bought
this
though
its
easy
to
drink
for
the
first
20oz
the
skunkiness
starts
to
catch
up
and
is
ultimately
disappointing
final
thoughts
i
reviewed
this
with
the
style
in
mind
not
a
terrible
malt
liquor
but
nothing
special
either
pick
it
up
if
you
need
a
cheap
brew
as
a
single
otherwise
dont
bother
this
beer
really
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
the
alcohol
content
is
not
8
10
thats
hurricane
high
gravity
which
really
only
has
that
going
for
it
it
tastes
worse
and
i
think
is
only
served
as
40s
try
hard
to
steer
clear
unless
youre
really
low
on
cash
and
just
want
to
get
sloshed
d
2
5
almost
drinkable
for
a
malt
liquor
i
would
rink
it
if
i
am
broke
or
if
it
is
my
only
beer
option
thats
about
it
good
for
the
style
i
guess
brace
for
the
smooth
taste
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
if
its
smooth
i
shouldnt
need
to
be
forewarned
this
pours
golden
and
clear
very
little
bubble
activity
smell
is
clean
mostly
with
a
note
of
corn
syrup
unremarkable
really
but
nothing
offensive
either
taste
is
pretty
darn
smooth
i
must
admit
sweet
and
with
a
light
vinous
fruit
taste
also
this
hides
the
abv
very
well
especially
for
style
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
no
fusel
alcohol
flavors
even
as
it
warmed
a
bit
mouthfeel
is
smooth
as
well
perhaps
needs
a
little
more
in
the
way
of
carbonation
finish
is
dry
and
clean
drinkability
for
40
standards
is
top
notch
this
is
beer
for
getting
drunk
on
so
no
need
to
treat
this
like
a
micro
and
judge
it
on
nose
appereance
ect
what
matters
here
is
drinkability
and
the
buzz
which
this
provides
in
spades
considering
the
cheap
price
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
you
wanna
make
sure
your
not
driving
anywhere
after
a
few
40s
this
is
my
cheap
beer
of
choice
and
if
you
hate
it
big
deal
your
only
down
1
09
however
i
do
recommend
drinking
this
out
of
a
glass
if
you
bought
a
can
the
metal
taste
seems
to
go
away
hurricane
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
clear
thirty
two
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
is
all
adjunct
there
is
a
bit
of
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
otherwise
its
just
generic
industrial
beer
flavor
no
hops
to
be
found
okay
for
what
it
is
but
there
are
probably
better
malt
liquors
out
there
that
being
said
after
dinner
im
gonna
swing
by
my
local
beverage
shack
and
snag
two
of
these
bad
boys
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
like
most
malt
liquors
i
dont
think
this
is
meant
for
glasses
the
nose
has
some
corn
syrup
like
malts
very
light
though
the
taste
is
of
corny
alcohol
and
not
much
else
somwhat
full
but
not
at
all
enjoyable
pours
a
super
light
yellowwhite
color
with
average
head
with
average
lacing
and
average
carbonation
the
dominate
smell
is
corn
and
mild
malts
first
taste
is
light
sweet
and
lcking
in
body
and
taste
after
the
corn
the
dominate
flavor
is
water
not
worth
buying
or
drinking
avoid
d
it
was
a
lot
like
drinking
water
that
gets
you
drunk
for
a
malt
liquor
it
was
very
light
in
flavor
and
mouthfeel
hurricane
is
for
getting
wasted
and
forgetting
about
the
past
and
nothing
more
its
smoothness
does
make
it
easier
to
go
down
though
ahh
the
old
slurricane
for
those
who
havent
had
the
pleasure
drink
a
couple
of
these
sugareddown
dandies
and
you
might
be
slllurrrinnnggg
your
words
or
just
puking
now
buds
other
40
offering
is
king
cobra
which
is
hideous
but
this
isnt
as
bad
i
think
it
is
because
it
is
smoother
and
doesnt
leave
a
stinging
backbite
it
is
also
higher
in
abv
so
maybe
i
was
just
too
drunk
to
notice
i
guess
if
i
had
to
pick
between
this
and
st
ides
i
would
take
this
although
i
probably
gave
st
ides
higher
marks
since
it
is
not
as
dirty
sweet
good
party
beer
but
not
a
good
beer
69

is
a
lot
of
corn
husk
and
good
bit
of

some
grain
tastewise
we
got
more
corn
here
and
some
pretty
nasty
fusellike
alcohol
followed
by
a
light
dry

and
a
touch
of
citrus
that
barely
sticks
out
from
behind
the

it
has

a

astringent

and
moderatelow

yeah
this
is
a
cheapo
alright
no
reason
to
ever
buy
this
one
again
this
is
not
for
the
beer
drinker
this
is
purely
for
the
person
that
wants
to
get
drunk
and
its
good
for
putting
out
in
shallow
pans
in
the
garden
to
kill
snails
overall
i
am
enjoying
this
slightly
more
than
i
thought
i
would
and
at
1
50
a
40oz
it
was
worth
giving
it
a
try
i
would
venture
to
guess
this
is
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
but
i
am
making
sure
to
only
have
it
as
cold
as
humanly
possible
i
noticed
on
each
successive
sip
that
i
was
disliking
this
beer
more
and
more
back
in
my
drunkonabudget
days
i
would
have
quaffed
a
40
of
high
life
or
steel
reserve
over
hurricane
camo
or
anything
else
whose
name
has
to
do
with
natural
disasterscombat
poured
the
rest
of
this
one
down
the
sink
the
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
the
person
seriously
drinking
this
to
get
drunk
couldnt
care
less
about
its
taste
i
believe
this
beer
would
be
best
enjoyed

at
a
time
out
of

giant

just
doesnt

is
another
bud
product
for
the
masses
1
69
40
oz
fat
clear
bottle
with
a
twist
off
cap
as
40
oz
bottles
of
malt
liquor
go
this
is
decent
and
very
competitively
priced
i
only
drink
40s
once
every
couple
of
months
now
but
my
friend
who
lives
and
dies
with
the
malt
liquor
has
a
fridge
stocked
with
25
of
these
babies
at
all
times
sometimes
you
want
a
forty
and
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
recommended
presentation
packaged
in
a
forty
ounce
clear
glass
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
i
only
ave
ever
consumed
or
seen
this
stuff
in
a
40
bottle
cler
darkish
gold
color
some
head
in
the
bottle
this
was
as
malt
liquors
go
not
bad
it
was
sweet
and
adjuncty
but
not
over
the
top
and
alcohol
was
not
kicking
you
in
the
throat
the
whole
time
mouthfeel
is
neutral
very
cheap
not
a
good
experience
but
not
terrible
this
is
the
2nd
and
last
of
the
crappy
malt
liquors
i
found
in
new
orleans
not
much
to
really
say
about
this
one
its
exactly
how
a
malt
liquor
usually
tastes
bad
appearance
sweet
macro
smell
and
overly
sweet
somewhat
nasty
taste
this
isnt
any
worse
or
better
than
most
malt
liquors
they
all
seem
pretty
much
the
same
to
me
anyway
something
this
lame
should
have
higher
than
6
alcohol
to
be
worthwhile
for
those
needing
a
quick
drunkening
epilogue
i
finished
the
40
then
i
had
a
bottle
of
pbr
baby
steps
folks
baby
steps
it
tasted
like
a
nice
hoppy
craft
brew
in
comparison
char
this
is
nothing
im
too
proud
to
drink
it
poured
a
urine
color
and
consistancy
luckily
it
didnt
smell
like
that
but
it
wasnt
much
better
i
had
a
bottle
of
skunk
thats
all
i
smelled
the
taste
was
grainy
with
mild
adjuncts
nothing
good
here
move
on
pours
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
disappears
immediately
some
carbonation
color
of
apple
well
closer
to
white
grape
juice
aroma
of
artifical
sweetness
apple
juice
fruitiness
sour
twangy
alcohol
and
little
else
taste
of
more
sour
just
sour
alcohol
and
sweetened
fruit
juice
suggestions
sweet
adjunctly
beeriness
nothing
really
to
see
here
folks
shudder
mouthfeel
is
thin
watery
a
bit
of
carbonated
fizz
mostly
just
waterhardly
even
an
alcohol
kick
just
water
drinkability
just
make
sure
you
give
it
your
best
shot
before
it
warms
up
pretty
awful
i
try
not
to
be
too
hard
on
the
malt
liquors
and
review
them
in
their
proper
context
but
this
went
down
the
drain
haha
everyone
loves
a
good
40
ounce
of
malt
liquor
from
time
to
time
i
personally
dont
have
much
of
a
problem
with
hurricane
in
fact
it
is
probably
one
of
the
better
anheuiser
busch
products
out
there
in
my
opinion
hurricane
has
a
unique
mouthfeel
and
a
somewhat
sweet
taste
its
really
not
that
bad
considering
its
a
malt
liquor
yes
sometimes
you
do
just
have
to
go
to
the
deli
where
nobody
speaks
any
english
whatsoever
and
grab
a
40
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
malt
liquor
40s
i
have
had
ice
cold
it
certainly
was
not
harsh
at
all
on
the
taste
buds
there
definitely
was
not
any
discernible
hop
flavor
a
grainy
malt
with
a
mild
alcohol
flavor
just
about
rounds
out
the
flavor
usually
near
the
bottom
of
a
40
i
am
pushing
myself
to
finish
it
but
this
one
was
real
easy
probably
because
its
one
of
the
weaker
ones
at
6
if
youre
40
shopping
this
isnt
a
bad
choice
brace
for
the
smooth
taste
fellow
ba
genaro
picked
this
22
oz
wide
mouth
bottle
up
from
a
gas
station
in
rural
georgia
so
we
were
expecting
this
to
be
a
topnotch
craft
brew
turns
out
to
be
a
crap
brew
this
has
to
be
the
most
horrible
malt
liquor
ever
brewed
the
pale
yellow
color
is
no
warning
for
the
nasty
tasting
cornmealy
malt
the
hops
must
be
the
cheapest
available
sugary
sweet
and
cardboard
flavored
its
bland
and
offensive
at
once
the
pasty
and
alcoholic
aroma
is
offensive
shame
on
the
busch
family
for
producing
this
beer

just
whom
are
they
trying
to
hook
on
this
awful
swill
i
couldnt
find
the
might
cause
blindness
or
permanent
liver
dysfunction
on
the
warning
label
hiss
boo
absolutely
horrible
nice
colouring
medium
honey
hue
limited
head
with
some
glass
ring
aroma
is
non
discript
and
the
taste
is
more
than
equal
to
the
dollar
value
this
product
is
marketable
sure
this
isnt
some
crazy
silly
awesome
beer
but
its
still
ok
i
used
to
get
it
when
i
was
in
college
cause
it
was
99
a
can
thats
awesome
99
for
a
22oz
and
it
wasnt
toally
nasty
beer
it
was
a
very
light
colored
beer
with
a
very
short
lived
head
most
likely
from
carbonation
had
a
kind
of
semisweet
taste
to
it
but
nothing
too
noticebale
finished
kinda
harsh
but
what
do
you
expect
sometimes
ya
just
gotta
grab
a
40
and
administer
a
quick
and
effective
attitude
adjustment
to
yourself
fortunately
i
dont
do
this
too
often
hurricane
is
just
another
run
of
the
mill
malt
liquor
with
the
usual
sweetness
pretty
bland
and
boring
i
wont
ever
drink
it
again
but
did
this
time
to
get
in
a
review
i
try
to
judge
every
beer
i
taste
on
its
specific
merits
and
i
dont
bring
style
or
personal
preferences
into
it
in
fact
im
a
fan
of
malt
liquors
but
this
one
is
not
real
good
and
thats
very
surprising
since
it
comes
from
budweiser
but
in
a
way
it
all
makes
sense
this
is
a
very
clean
except
for
the
fruitiness
unobtrusive
lager
i
feel
its
a
bit
too
limited
for
the
style
that
said
it
has
a
deep
gold
color
with
a
thick
but
not
very
dense
head
and
a
generic
malt
hop
aroma
the
body
is
fairly
light
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
flavor
it
has
a
fruitiness
but
limited
maltiness
and
no
hop
flavor
very
low
bitterness
finishes
fruity
but
very
clean
loook
for
all
u
hating
and
underrating
this
beer
just
be
honest
and
grow
sum
balls
and
call
it
wat
it
is
bottom
of
da
barrel
brew
its
a
cheap
beer
with
a
pretty
good
amount
of
alcohol
by
volume
this
is
basicly
a
perfect
sample
of
bang
for
ur
buck
now
i
could
waste
everybodys
time
and
compare
it
like
other
beers
but
but
dats
not
da
case
its
ok
i
likw
the
higher
alcohol
seems
a
bit
sweet
1
49
was
not
too
bad
cheap
gets
you
buzzed
fast
so
thats
not
that
bad
not
good
for
much
else
i
have
to
agree
with
many
of
the
reviews
here
for
a
bottom
of
the
barrel
bargain
basement
brew
its
not
half
bad
it
looks
like
apple
juice
theres
odd
golden
brown
color
to
it
with
excellent
clarity
and
vibrant
carbonation
bubbles
no
head
whatsoever
faint
cereal
grain
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
a
mix
of
cereal
grains
like
a
sweeter
version
of
honey
nut
cheerios
the
mouth
is
moderately
carbonated
and
yet
designed
to
be
quite
smooth
overall
this
is
just
an
unfortunate
beer
its
flavor
is
bad
for
the
style
which
is
really
saying
something
better
than
expected
smooth
flavor
amber
color
this
is
meant
to
do
one
thing
and
it
does
it
well
drink
one
of
these
and
you
will
feel
it
weak
aroma
but
that
isnt
unusual
for
malt
liquors
hurricane
is
a
surprisingly
solid
malt
liquor
arguably
my
favorite
of
the
ones
ive
tried
many
of
them
are
either
far
too
thin
to
be
enjoyed
suffer
from
a
pungent
taste
if
their
temperature
drops
just
a
few
degrees
or
shamelessly
bear
their
alcohol
in
the
taste
making
for
an
unappetizing
experience
im
looking
at
you
camo
silver
ice
and
sighing
whenever
i
see
the
camo
black
extra
24oz
can
in
my
fridge
hurricane
doesnt
provide
an
overcompensating
palette
of
flavors
nor
does
it
find
itself
being
too
thin
and
basic
to
really
be
enjoyed
on
a
level
other
than
a
dirtcheap
malt
liquor
its
genuinely
pleasing
packs
a
simple
but
refreshing
taste
to
it
and
provides
a
nice
buzz
if
the
can
is
drank
fast
enough
its
a
marginallywinning
combination
clear
gold
appearance
if
poured
aggressively
a
head
will
appear
but
then
vanish
almost
instantly
fruity
aroma
with
the
corn
again
the
fruitiness
shows
up
in
the
taste
and
the
alcohol
can
also
be
detected
it
sorta
coats
the
mouth
with
an
oiliness
medium
body
fairly
dry
finish
and
kinda
sour
overall
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
is
all
that
it
is
overall
this
40
surprised
me
in
both
its
alcohol
content
and
its
lack
of
residual
shttiness
dare
i
say
that
this
malt
liquor
is
even
refreshing
that
remains
to
be
seen
one
can
not
know
its
true
nature
until
he
ingests
one
in
its
entirety
another
property
that
40s
share
with
sex
toys
i
recommend
this
beer
be
paired
with
a
burger
king
angry
whopper
on
an
overcast
spring
day
in
order
to
allow
the
flavours
of
both
to
fully
develop
this
beer
is
not
recommended
for
extended
cellaring
unless
abv
exceeds
average
range
enjoy
i
copped
a
buzz
off
of
half
a
25
ouncer
and
im
likely
to
either
drink
the
rest
or
cook
with
it
think
about
it
the
time
wasted
on
a
bad
review
could
be
spent
drinking
bass
guiness
or
fosters
i
mean
really
you
like
their
super
bowl
commercials
right
they
always
make
me
smile
and
sometimes
even
bring
a
tear
to
my
eye
omgthis
site
is
for
connossieurs
right
if
you
dont
like
it
why
dont
you
drink
a
glass
of
water
instead
uninspired
but
not
offensive
good
buzz
factor
at

that
is

i
can
get

off

i
got
a
25
oz
of
this
to
do
a
review
poured
this
into
a
glass
the
color
is
a
drak
amber
small
white
head
after
the
first
pour
smell
was
ok
nothing
to
bad
the
tease
was
not
the
greatest
but
not
the
worst
you
can
tell
the
8
1
abv
in
this
brew
i
will
say
this
the
can
says
be
bold
and
it
is
bold
be
smooth
and
it
is
smooth
going
down
mouthfeel
was
ok
overall
this
brew
is
a
3
nothing
good
but
nothing
bad
i
good
brew
if
you
want
one
or
you
are
low
on
cash
i
will
take
you
where
you
want
to
go
note
my
review
stats
might
seem
high
here
but
im
judging
the
beer
on
what
it
is
cheap
strong
lager
beer
for
those
times
when
you
just
want
something
light
in
body
yet
high
in
alcohol
or
when
youre
broke
cheers
o
to
me
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
in
this
class
high
abvlow
cost
you
really
need
to
drink
this
one
cold
the
8
1
abv
is
not
all
that
evident
and
this
one
can
sneak
up
on
you
fast
there
are
some
really
bad
hgs
out
there
and
this
isnt
one
of
them
bettter
than
4
loko
tilt
joose
mikes
harder
lemonade
or
another
fake
ass
sugary
swill
from
a
24
ounce
can
i
couldnt
get
my
son
to
help
me
with
this
one
our
corner
shop
doesnt
have
much
variety
so
i
tend
to
try
anything
new
that
they
get
in
dark
goldbrown
beer
with
not
much
head
but
lots
of
carbonation
smells
of
musty
corn
and
metal
it
tastes
well
bad
like
watery
stale
ginger
ale
with
a
hint
of
copper
im
not
picky
at
all
when
it
comes
to
beer
youll
often
find
natty
light
or
pbr
in
my
fridge
but
this
is
one
that
i
wont
ever
be
drinking
again
the
alcohol
is
not
hidden
in
the
slightest
it
sits
overtop
of
a
big
corny
sweet
and
slightly
syrupy
body
very
grainy
and
husky
and
just
not
tasty
at
all
hi
well
my
old
rating
was
2
5
without
the
whole
review
and
after
closely
inspecting
this
beer
and
drinking
more
and
more
of
it
and
others
my
score
has
increased
i
just
drank
one
of
these
and
honestly
this
is
an
amazing
beer
i
just
bought
a
16
oz
for
1
06
some
places
they
might
be
about
1
25
or
so
well
anyways
the
beer
tastes
really
good
for
8
1
alc
and
the
buzz
you
get
is
very
nice
waaayyy
better
than
211
thats
all
i
got
to
say
have
a
nice
day
o
if
drinking
a
24
ounce
can
on
the
way
home
from
work
were
legal
i
would
do
it
it
is
cheap
and
gives
some
bang
for
the
buck
o
overall
i
feel
this
is
just
a
high
abv
corn
based
beer
with
no
malt
in
it
i
thought
it
would
be
a
nice
malty
malt
liquor
but
this
was
not
the
case
im
pretty
disappointed
in
this
ofor
the
style
its
a
decent
malt
liquor
pretty
darn
drinkable
for
the
abv
if
your
a
malt
liqour
fan
you
would
most
likely
enjoy
this
very
much
so
better
than
i
expected
but
i
probably
wont
buy
again
overall
its
shit
overall
ill
never
try
this
again
i
didnt
even
drink
half
of
a
beer
and
im
feeling
sick
to
my
stomach
this
is
by
no
means
a
great
beer
but
when
viewed
by
style
its
not
bad
it
has
some
drinkability
despite
its
off
flavors
its
dirt
cheap
if
moneys
tight
like
maybe
youre
a
teacher
and
its
summer
like
me
then
these
are
the
kind
of
beers
you
look
for
o
if
ones
strapped
for
boozecash
this
here
is
the
way
to
go
there
arent
many
us
malt
liquors
that
are
good
at
all
when
enjoyed
warm
as
is
my
preference
this
is
one
of
them
thats
a
high
accolade
for
such
a
cheap
brew
ab
has
done
something
very
right
with
this
massmarket
product
though
i
have
a
feeling
the
name
might
not
be
such
a
good
thing
down
along
the
gulf
and
atlantic
coasts
aroma
is
hello
aroma
i
dont
get
a
whiff
of
anything
that
resembles
beer
it
pours
a
clear
yellow
with
a
fairly
thick
and
fluffy
white
head
but
this
is
the
brews
strongest
point
flavor
is
at
least
present
but
it
is
just
malty
no
complexity
or
depth
and
leaves
a
tinny
aftertaste
texture
is
smooth
a
bit
thin
and
barely
fizzy
at
all
i
bought
it
just
to
try
something
different
at
least
it
helps
me
appreciate
craft
brews
o
pretty
standard
malt
liquor
flavor
that
gets
pretty
boozy
in
the
end
not
a
great
beverage
but
damn
this
packs
a
punch
surprisingly
good
compared
to
most
of
the
other
malt
liquors
i
have
tasted
lately
and
that
oddball
honeydew
melon
smell
was
actually
quite
nice
overall
what
can
i
say
kind
of
a
standard
malt
liquor
in
flavor
only
a
bit
lighter
in
sweetness
and
body
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
lighter
qualities
sweetness
body
although
that
may
not
be
a
good
thing
due
to
its
heavier
qualities
abv
from
fred
meyer
s
salem
store
1
19
yeah
its
been
a
bad
day
and
i
am
broke
cant
believe
i
actually
poured
this
into
a
mug
but
its
brightclear
pale
yellow
with
a
artificial
looking
impressive
creamy
thick
head
papercorn
and
alcohol
aroma
taste
sweet
malts
but
actually
not
as
sickeningly
sweet
as
expected
its
a
rather
soft
sweetness
some
apples
in
there
too
actually
surprisingly
ok
in
the
mouthfeel
slight
alcohol
d
malty
sweet
malt
bomb
very
thin
mouthful
for
8
1
cant
taste
the
booze
malt
covers
the
booze
serve
ice
cold
makes
a
difference
cant
beat
the
price
2
99
for
a
4
pack
of
16oz
cans
this
beer
is
a
proper
sessional
beer
when
kicking
back
and
hanging
out
with
friends
for
the
price
i
feel
as
if
i
had
this
coming
to
me
2
beers
worth
for
a
buck
what
did
i
expect
flavors
of
apple
and
wet
manila
folders
ritz
crackers
and
vague
sweetness
light
body
and
easygoing
feel
when
cold
dry
and
surprisingly
clean
aftertaste
maybe
not
all
that
surprising
coming
from
ab
king
of
consistently
bland
beers
wonder
what
kind
of
adjuncts
they
threw
in
here
to
jack
up
the
abv
the
cleanliness
of
this
malt
liquor
is
its
best
asset
and
it
never
becomes
harsh
like
so
many
others
one
thumb
halfway
up
ok
the
first
sip
of
this
beer
was
torture
but
it
got
a
bit
better
as
my
tastebuds
got
used
to
the
idea
in
this
small
window
this
beer
needs
to
be
finished
quickly
because
as
it
warms
it
becomes
awful
again
it
makes
me
feel
young
again
holding
my
nose
to
drink
the
first
few
bought
this
at
a
quick
stop
convenience
store
in
festus
mo
on
my
way
to
bonne
terre
when
i
got
to
my
destination
i
pulled
out
my
hurricane
high
gravity
lager
and
poured
it
appearance
was
average
it
looked
like
a
typical
malt
liquor
smell
was
grainy
taste
was
smooth
smoother
than
steel
reserve
no
alcohol
burn
like
the
reserve
it
was
slick
and
coated
my
tougnue
perfectly
id
have
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
no
need
to
give
details
just
because
of
the
style
but
this
ml
by
ab
is
one
of
the
best
to
pick
up
for
the
price
and
abv
at
only
1
29
a
tallboy
this
is
the
cheap
way
to
party
the
taste
is
cleaner
than
most
ml
and
a
slight
note
of
real
hops
is
tasteable
does
not
give
the
after
alcohol
burn
that
most
ml
do
the
taste
is
pretty
much
all
sweet
and
lemony
with
a
alcohol
backbone
this
light
bodied
beers
aftertaste
is
also
lemon
filled
and
leaves
your
mouth
with
this
moist
wetness
d
surprisingly
decent
although
itd
still
be
a
challenge
to
put
down
a
24oz
can
i
dont
understand
these
8
malt
liquors
either
you
have
to
suffer
50
more
to
achieve
the
same
level
of
inebriation
still
this
would
be
in
the
upper
quarter
of
gas
station
offerings
this
is
the
best
beer
in
its
category
far
superior
to
other
cheap
8
1
abv
beers
if
youre
broke
or
homeless
this
will
do
the
trick
final
thought
if
you
need
to
get
drunk
get
simpler
times
lager
you
get
a
six
pack
for
1
more
dollar
overall
drinkability
not
too
bad
for
an
american
malt
liquor
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
this
for
tasting
purposes
but
if
catching
a
quick
buzz
on
the
cheap
is
your
goal
then
its
an
interesting
beer
not
horrible
but
i
cant
imagine
a
locale
that
doesnt
have
something
better
to
drink
and
if
youre
poor
get
a
better
job
also
worthy
of
noting
the
main
label
advertises
this
as
a
lager
but
on
the
side
of
the
can
it
claims
the
beverage
to
be
an
ale
anyone
else
curious
i
think
this
beer
is
ok
for
those
that
want
a
great
buzz
in
a
short
amount
of
time
without
having
to
hold
your
nose
while
shotgunning
it
this
doesnt
have
much
flavour
at
all
its
got
a
little
bit
of
a
bitter
metallic
taste
it
has
a
slight
bad
beer
taste
theres
some
corn
flavour
in
there
but
somehow
the
corn
flavour
is
far
worse
than
that
in
other
corny
malt
liquors
the
aftertaste
of
this
beer
is
really
terrible
it
tastes
sort
of
like
metal
and
terrible
cheap
cereal
grains
this
is
far
better
than
its
primary
competitor
steel
reserve
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
flybynight
operation
at
a
dirty
chemical
plant
but
its
certainly
not
good
it
tastes
like
maybe
they
put
too
much
effort
into
not
making
it
overly
sweet
but
forgot
to
not
make
it
gross
overall
not
interesting
at
all
but
ok
in
taste
i
tastes
more
than
nothing
but
tastes
less
than
foul
could
be
a
repeat
buy
for
the
warmer
months
to
come
im
finding
that
the
big
breweries
malt
liquor
offerings
are
better
beers
than
their
big
selling
mainstream
name
brews
good
bang
for
you
buck
as
far
as
alcohol
goes
24oz
can
cost
me
2
but
i
think
id
rather
have
a
40
of
old
english
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
notes
pretty
much
what
you
expect
from
a
mass
produced
malt
liquor
a
bit
less
fruitiness
than
others
it
taste
slightly
different
from
the
others
but
it
is
really
better
or
worse
than
other
similar
malt
liquors
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
sweetness
like
creamed
corn
and
a
little
grass
tastes
a
lot
like
corn
and
booze
mixed
together
like
ethanol
or
something
would
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
drinkability
is
well
below
average
dn
i
think
a
24oz
can
will
be
enough
i
guess
this
beer
is
ok
a
friend
of
mine
left
a
can
at
my
house
i
wouldnt
buy
it
unless
all
i
had
in
my
wallet
was
1
49
my
roommate
brought
this
to
me
what
a
guy
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
reluctantly
consumed
the
body
pours
a
transparent
yellow
body
with
lots
of
visible
carbonation
and
a
small
fizzy
white
head
the
aroma
is
grainy
kind
of
wheaty
and
a
bid
medicinal
something
about
a
cough
syrup
aroma
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
in
beer
the
taste
and
the
smell
may
as
well
just
be
one
in
the
same
just
grainy
and
medicinal
bleh
this
is
kind
of
light
and
over
carbonated
and
really
boozy
in
the
mouth
my
roommate
brought
this
to
me
and
called
it
the
cheapest
swill
on
the
market
its
clear
why
however
it
does
go
down
pretty
easy
just
as
long
as
you
close
your
eyes
and
open
your
gullet
i
dont
recommend
this
at
all
i
am
guessing
at
ba
we
are
all
pretty
much
beer
lovers
who
are
supposed
to
appreciate
beer
because
of
the
taste
i
dont
make
a
regular
habit
of
drinking
this
stuff
but
i
am
not
going
to
liethere
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
drinking
a
cheap
very
high
abv
nobrainer
brew
that
will
make
you
feel
good
and
fuzzy
inside
and
is
ridiculously
cheap
honestly
of
all
the
ab
products
i
actually
consider
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
onesdecent
taste
none
of
that
terrible
sour
rice
flavor
of
budweiser
cheap
price
great
buzz
and
overall
easy
drinking
overall
you
get
what
you
pay
for
if
youre
looking
to
get
a
buzz
this
is
fast
and
cheap
if
youre
looking
for
taste
i
would
recommend
leaving
this
one
at
the
store
d
for
a
malt
liquor
not
to
bad
but
for
only
light
drinking
occasions
not
too
terrible
this
was
my
divorce
beer
but
its
been
a
while
since
i
retried
it
as
a
refined
drinker
not
too
disappointed
its
worth
the
1

good
sticky

left
behind
scents
of

dry

the

full
for
the

and

pretty
crisp
as
well
flavors
of
heavy
grains
corn
honey
light
booze
bitterness
is
low
this
wasnt
all
that
bad
pretty
good
beer
for
campfires
tailgates
cookouts
etc
when
cheap
beer
is
in
need
its
hurricane
indeed
would
pair
horribly
with
everything
md
thick
carbonated
water
drinks
better
than
others
ive
had
so
far
but
it
could
be
the
fact
that
its
the
first
cold
drink
after
work
the
best
malt
liquor
i
have
had
despite
its
high
abv
its
better
tasting
than
many
other
ab
products
i
have
sampled
and
its
cheap
give
it
a
shot
see
what
you
think
it
may
not
suit
you
but
if
so
ask
is
it
really
worse
than
some
other
nonmalt
macros
you
have
drunk
recently
if
not
why
shouldnt
you
keep
it
in
your
occasional
rotation
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
strong
corn
no
doubt
what
this
beer
is
brewed
with
the
flavor
is
very
sweet
corn
with
the
slightest
hint
of
orange
citrus
light
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
for
a
macroproduced
malt
liquor
this
is
not
terrible
but
compared
to
regular
beers
this
is
one
to
avoid
sweet
but
not
as
much
as
i
had
feared
and
the
alcohol
is
a
bit
more
tame
still
looms
large
but
not
unbearable
fruity
alcohol
and
the
honeyed
adjuncts
with
zero
hop
presence
make
for
an
interesting
beverage
indeed
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
creamy
and
full
bodied
for
a
malt
licka
not
bad
but
is
far
from
my
favorite
version
of
the
style
many
of
the
high
gravity
offerings
are
tough
to
choke
down
unsurprisingly
from
24
fl
oz
can
no

sampled

the
pour
is
a
highly
carbonated
golden
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
shrinks
quickly
the
aroma
has
a
tolerable
malty
note
with
a
vague
hoppiness
too
the
alcohol
taste
is
better
masked
than
i
expected
on
this
particular
can
it
really
had
a
malted
but
corny
flavor
and
left
no
aftertaste
actually
this
was
smoother
than
others
i
have
had
and
i
feel
i
should
rate
it
higher
than
previous
raters
i
actually
do
drink
some
malt
liquors
but
this
smelled
and
tasted
like
fuel
less
calories
but
a
really
strong
alcohol
aftertastepass
on
this
one
rjt
uhhh
surprised
is
definitely
the
word
of
choice
i
thought
this
would
be
poor
at
best
its
actually
good
for
the
style
and
would
not
even
rank
in
the
worst
25
beers
ive
had
everything
about
this
beer
at
first
appearance
indicates
it
will
be
massproduced
swill
with
only
the
bottom
line
considered
not
sure
that
some
of
that
isnt
true
but
it
might
be
the
best
cheap
highgravity
malt
liquor
ive
had
further
proof
that
ab
has
the
capability
to
brew
good
beer
if
that
ever
becomes
their
goal
d
surprisingly
an
enjoyable
drink
but
be
warned
it
isnt
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
is
not
for
someone
who
doesnt
enjoy
malts
otherwise
it
is
a
great
brew
that
has
a
decent
flavor
and
a
good
alcohol
content
try
it
and
choose
your
side
d
this
is
not
really
any
worse
than
other
malt
liquors
i
have
had
but
i
would
say
there
are
better
options
out
there
in
this
category
the
booze
is
a
bit
too
noticeable
for
me
poured
in
a
glass
it
is
a
darker
yellow
expected
from
malt
liquor
the
smell
not
so
great
i
expected
it
to
be
a
little
stronger
the
taste
is
rather
decent
considering
the
abv
it
is
rather
smooth
with
a
light
mouthfeel
that
finishes
suprising
clean
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
taste
for
the
price
and
abv
it
works
out
nicely
when
you
cant
afford
your
favorite
faint
spice
and
sweet
malt
aroma
its
exactly
the
same
color
as
your
piss
when
youre
dehydrated
head
disappears
immediately
flavor
of
sweet
malt
and
skunky
medicine
hides
the
alcohol
pretty
well
its
just
plain
awful
but
if
you
need
to
get
drunk
with
the
change
in
your
couch
this
is
the
one
for
you
poured
from
a
tall
can
into
a
glass
with
born
on
date
on
bottom
of
the
can
pours

with
little
head
and
minimal
carbonation
bold
yellow
color
creamy
film
on
top
of
the
glass
faint
banana
smell
along
with
extra
sweetness
flavor
is
not
to
complex
sweet
flavor
tastes
of
sugar
and
corn
mouthfeel
is
pretty
bland
drinkable
nature
is
okay
paired
okay
with
a
cheese
burger
over
the
years
this
has
become
my
favorite
high
gravity
malt
liquor
its
not
easy
to
call
a
beer
of
this
style
refreshing
but
id
almost
go
that
far
with
this
one
a
great
high
gravity
to
introduce
friends
to
the
style
easy
to
drink
easy
to
find
easy
on
the
wallet
poured
from
a
clear
40
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mostly
of
alcohol
some
malts
taste
is
alcohol
a
hint
of
malts
and
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
not
terrible
but
nothing
special
here
the
bad
thing
is
after
i
drinked
the
half
of
the
can
this
beer
bored
me
and
didnt
finished
cheers
it
began
with
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
but
it
quickly
reduced
to
mere
wisps
the
color
was
a
deep
golden
amber
with
nequality
clarity
bubbles
were
evident
in
the
beer
due
to
his
high
clarity
it
had
a
real
bupgoo
look
to
it
nose
had
a
definite
lager
sweetness
along
with
a
fruity
quality
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
berrylike
sweetness
strawberry
red
raspberry
along
those
lines
on
the
tongue
finish
was
somewhat
dry
with
that
berry
quality
lingering
well
after
the
swallow
frankly
not
bad
for
a
canned
malt
liquor
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
first
off
let
me
say
that
if
your
drinking
this
brew
you
must
be
looking
for
a
good
buzz
assuming
thats
the
case
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
hg
malts
out
there
at
times
it
got
a
little
offensive
but
nothing
near
other
hg
malts
with
around
the
same
abv
i
could
easily
drink
as
many
as
i
wanted
with
this
beer
knowing
that
im
getting
the
most
for
my
money
flavor
abv
wise
this
one
was
pretty
smooth
considering
how
much
alcohol
was
in
it
i
definitely
recommend
this
for
someone
thats
low
on
cash
looking
for
a
good
buzz
and
not
wanting
to
settle
for
steel
reserve
or
worse
cheers
poured
from
a
40

small

or
of
so
little

to

you
got
to
be
kidding
if
you
like
hiigh
abv
and
a
cheap

and
you
are
real
thristy
this
brew
is
for
you
pale
golden
with
a
rocky

that
fades

large

rise
from
the

steely

soft

alcohol
all
mingle
in
the
nose
corn
sugar
and
a
slightly
metallic

with
a
dry
clean
finish
alcoholic
heat
is
felt
but
its
not
overpowering
medium
light
bodied
with
massive
gassy
carbonation
an
above
average
malt
liquor
if
you
can
like
the
style
for
what
it
is
what
was
i
thinking
overall
daddy
out
i
only
put
serving
type
as
bottle
because
a
40
was
not
an
option
ive
actually
had
this
a
few
times
but
that
is
probably
because
im
in
college
and
because
im
cheap
it
pours
a
light
yellow
with
almost
not
head
the
taste
is
like
licking
a
metal
fence
it
really
does
not
go
down
well
and
the
8
10
can
really
put
you
on
your
ass
im
still
hungover
and
its
7pm
thanks
high
grav
inoffensive
for
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
abv
not
as
bad
as
i
would
have
guessed
but
still
not
something
i
would
set
out
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
fizzy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
faint
pilsner
malt
scent
with
loads
of
adjuncts
and
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
there
is
little
to
no
hop
aroma
present
the
taste
is
below
average
it
has
an
extremely
dry
taste
that
barely
resembles
beer
its
crisp
and
clean
but
its
devoid
of
any
malt
character
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
poor
tasting
beer
im
not
a
big
fan
of
malt
liquors
in
general
but
this
one
just
isnt
very
good
its
one
and
done
for
me
i
bought
it
expecting
it
to
be
your
ordinary
run
of
the
mill
flavorless
cheap
malt
liquor
boy
was
i
wrong
the
moment
i
got
this
stuff
in
my
mouth
i
wished
i
had
just
left
it
in
the
cooler
one
of
my
buddies
described
it
as
liquid
ass
and
i
dont
think
he
was

not
really
that
bad
for
the
style
worth
the
money
in
my
opinion
for
malt
liquors
i
prefer
mickeys
but
in
the
hg
category
this
one
has
become
probably
the
best
ive
tried
too
bad
for
me
the
mouthfeel
was
about
the
only
thing
that
was
decent
about
this
malt
beverage
kind
of
creamy
with
a
fair
bit
of
body
the
sweet
after
taste
made
me
not
enjoy
this
brew
ones
too
much
for
my
likes
cant
recommend
d
perhaps
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
out
there
no
real
astringent
qualities
to
this
at
all
certainly
the
cleanest
malt
liquor
i
have
ever
tasted
went
great
with
some
homemade
spinach
dip
and
ritz
crackers
the
little
lady
is
always
complaining
about
how
much
i
spend
on
beer
and
to
be
honest
some
of
the
beers
i
buy
are
10
for
the
750
ml
corked
bottle
so
quite
often
ill
bring
home
a
case
of
this
beer
in
24
oz
cans
total
cost
16
50
for
15
cans
at
8
1
abv
thats
a
lotta
bang
for
the
buck
sure
it
reeks
of
corn
but
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
especially
if
you
finish
it
before
it
gets
warm
i
think
of
it
as
bud
squared
no
really
it
is
a
ton
better
than
the
malt
liquour
we
grew
up
with
this
beer
pours
a
darkish
clear
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
head
that
dissipates
quickly
it
looks
like
the
urine
of
a
person
who
is
sick
with
hepatitis
or
cirrhosisi
used
to
work
in
a
hospital
the
smell
is
awful
like
chemicals
corn
and
adjuncts
the
taste
is
actually
not
too
bad
sweet
with
a
very
slight
malt
taste
and
alcohol
burn
going
down
the
throat
it
tastes
basically
like
a
souped
up
macro
lager
the
reason
im
reviewing
this
malt
liquor
is
because
they
recently
started
showing
up
in
stores
here
in
nc
and
i
wanted
to
try
a
few
just
for
the
hell
of
it
i
think
my
money
would
be
better
spent
on
some
craft
beer
instead
ill
leave
this
stuff
to
the
dudes
hanging
out
on
the
street
corner
drink
the
worst
beers
first
just
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
it
pours
okay
light
piss
yellow
with
a
fair
head
that
doesnt
die
the
smell
is
oh
my
god
sweet
like
camo
tastes
so
gross
the
taste
is
bad
at
best
sorta
not
really
sweet
with
a
strong
bitter
taste
that
rounds
it
out
but
try
chugging
and
that
old
sweet
taste
rears
its
head
barf
the
mouthfeel
is
terrible
watery
with
carbonation
that
coats
your
mouth
with
this
taste
and
mouthfeel
you
know
the
drinkability
is
going
to
be
shitty
there
are
much
better
malt
liquors
out
there
best
case
scenario
this
is
an
alternative
to
the
camos
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
to
nothing
in
a
hurry
it
smells
of
corn
and
other
sweet
crappy
adjuncts
the
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
also
kind
of
corny
overall
its
pretty
crappy
tasting
but
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
malt
liquors
this
one
is
part
of
the
better
half
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
easy
drinkability
is
decent
better
than
a
lot
of
other
crappy
cheap
beers
as
for
drinkability
for
what
it
is
which
is
a
cheap
malt
liquor
its
good
if
you
arent
already
a
malt
liquor
fan
then
id
say
go
elsewhere
but
if
you
are
then
this
could
displace
something
already
in
your
rotation
im
serious
the
bloodhound
factor
benji
wrinkled
his
nose
and
took
off
after
one
taste
peaches
wouldnt
touch
it
good
call
on
their
part
oddly
enoughm
probably
the
best
brew
i
have
had
from
anheuserbusch
and
i
definitely
felt
the
power
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentyfour
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
born
on
date
is
august
6
2005
ok
in
the
drinkability
department
i
cant
say
i
would
seek
this
out
but
if
the
choice
is
this
or
budweiser
i
would
pick
this
hurricane
high
gravity
lager
with
its
eye
pleasing
colour
and
a
good
head
of
foam
complete
with
lacing
plus
the
8
1
alcohol
by
volume
will
win
some
beer
drinkers
over
to
the
hgl
side
but
its
once
around
the
block
for
me
wow
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
another
awfull
malt
liquor
but
it
turned
out
to
be
not
half
bad
the
pour
was
decent
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
lasted
till
the
end
and
the
beer
had
a
decent
light
amber
color
the
smell
was
pure
grain
and
dingy
malt
as
to
be
expected
but
the
taste
was
decent
for
a
malt
liquor
it
had
a
very
sweet
malty
front
then
it
moved
into
a
slightly
grainy
middle
and
finished
with
lingering
sweetness
that
was
quite
agreeable
for
a
malt
liquor
if
you
want
a
smoothe
malt
liquor
that
is
not
half
bad
take
a
stab
at
this
one
not
bad
really
like
the
commercial
used
to
say
dont
let
the
smooth
taste
fool
ya
best
40
on
the

best
bang
for
your
buck
king
cobra
drink
it
and
youll
be
a
cobra
for
life
my
malt
of
choice
very
drinkable
but
as
with
malts
definitely
intended
to
get
someone
drunk
over
a
great
drink
o
very
refreshing
but
a
bit
tame
for
a
high
gravity
lager
if
you
must
mow
your
lawn
this
year
king
cobra
will
balm
the
savage
thirst
nothing
fancy
just
an
easy
to
drink
malt
liquor
malt
and
corn
sweetness
crisp
light
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
golden
color
with
only
a
small
lace
of
head
around
the
rim
highly
carbonated
smells
like
standard
corn
adjunct
lager
not
much
flavor
until
it
reaches
the
bottom
of
your
throat
not
as
putrid
as
i
expected
a
little
bitter
in
the
aftertaste
after
a
couple
tastes
im
starting
to
taste
the
fuel
like
malt
liquor
flavor
far
from
the
best
malt
liquor
but
not
the
worst
either
when
i
used
to
drink
malt
liquors
this
was
my
favorite
malt
liquors
exist
to
get
a
person
drunk
as
possible
on
the
least
amount
of
money
and
i
used
to
buy
kc
quartz
for
99
cents
plus
tax
and
crv
back
in
the
90s
but
i
have
not
had
this
beer
since
first
and
worst
hangover
best
part
of
this
corn
spit
is
the
name
king
cobra
overall
i
cant
recommend
this
beer
to
you
but
i
wouldnt
say
this
isnt
something
you
shouldnt
try
my
averge
for
the
rating
is
2
8ish
which
rounds
to
being
a
3
its
okay
but
to
me
it
is
a
bit
harsh
and
i
would
rather
drink
old
english
800
or
private
stock
instead
yes
this
is
not
a
truly
fine
brew
but
it
is
cold
wet
carbonated
and
cheap
you
get
what
you
py
for
and
sometimes
it
isnt
the
higher
priced
stuff
this
stuff
is
not
too
bad
when
icy
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
actually
its
pretty
good
considering
the
price
although
it
desperately
needs
some
hops
sadly
adding
a
decent
amount
of
hops
would
raise
the
price
defeating
the
point
of
being
the
cheapest
beer
around
i
give
it
a
4
5
because
it
is
good
value
for
the
money
and
probably
best
in
its
class
drink
the
ol
fouroh
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
neck
top
the
bottle
off
with
a
little
tropicana
orange
juice
gently
swirl
enjoy
this
wonderful
poor
mans
mimosa
make
mike
d
proud
get
your
brass
monkey
on
son
if
you
aint
on
that
king
cobra
grind
then
you
better
get
your
head
right
or
your
wig
split
overall
not
something
id
recommend
unless
youre
interested
in
emptying
the
change
in
your
pockets
i
didnt
enjoy
this
malt
liquor
that
much
but
its
alright
i
think
theres
much
better
out
there
king
cobra
premium
malt
liquor
25
many
friends
of
mine
are
in
sheer
disbelief
that
i
actually
like
this
beer
you
probably
asking
yourself
why
like
they
do
first
off
the
taste
to
me
is
better
that
any
other
malt
liquor
and
although
the
ingredients
are
simple
corn
its
a
smooth
drink
its
also
high
in
alcohol
content
which
for
its
price
gives
a
nice
cheap
buzz
if
i
drink
enough
the
corn
taste
keeps
getting
sweeter
drink
this
stuff
ice
cold
and
its
better
in
cans
the
light
cant
get
to
it
o
this
is
best
drank
ice
cold
quickly
and
straight
from
the
can
or
bottle
still
for
what
it
is
it
really
isnt
all
that
bad
pours
a
lifeless
clear
pale
straw
color
with
no
head
or
lacing
nose
is
corny
grainy
musty
and
metallic
there
are
hints
of
stale
skunky
character
at
the
end
taste
starts
with
water
followed
by
an
addition
of
slightly
sweet
and
musty
grain
notes
that
gain
in
strength
the
finish
is
metallic
and
stale
tasting
mouthfeel
is
light
and
fizzy
yeah
this
one
is
pretty
bad
how
ever
if
you
do
try
it
its
only
a
1
80
loss
i
have
only
tryed
steel
reserve
in
a
24oz
can
which
costs
as
much
as
the
cobra
yet
you
are
getting
16
less
ounces
the
price
on
the
cobra
can
not
be
beat
but
of
coarse
the
taste
can
be
beat
try
this
for
yourself
if
low
on
money
it
will
get
the
job
done
and
for
only
1
65
for
a
40
wow
what
a
deal
hats
off
to
anheuser
busch
for
that
o
overall
this
malt
liquor
is
quite
good
its
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
great
taste
refreshing
o
not
very
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
kick
solid
representation
of
style
considering
the
style
its
not
too
bad
but
there
are
other
inexpensive
beers
i
would
prefer
if
i
were
just
trying
to
get
a
buzz
o
obviously
not
a
highend
sophisticated
brew
but
nothing
offensive
i
would
not
seek
this
out
or
list
it
among
my
favorites
but
would
drink
again
if
offered
better
than
the
only
other
malt
liquor
i
tried
id
choose
a
big
a
every
time

overall
i
guess
its
not
that
bad
for
being
1
89
for
a
40oz
but
ill
never
resort
to
drinking
this
again
unless
im
poor
haha
o
this
is
awful
even
by
malt
liquor
standards
i
think
i
may
have
been
overly
generous
when
i
gave
this
monstrosity
scores
of
1
5
across
the
board
this
may
very
well
be
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tried
okay
i
will
be
fair
on
my
assessment
of
this
beer
obviously
malt
liquor
is
not
a
gourmet
beer
but
this
one
is
drinkable
first
off
its
cheap
and
if
youre
broke
or
in
a
pinch
its
not
that
bad
the
downfall
of
this
beer
is
the
raunchy
malt
aroma
which
makes
the
taste
all
that
worse
the
beer
pours
like
a
stereotypical
malt
liquor
and
has
the
ubiquitous
harsh
taste
oh
who
am
i
kidding
you
get
what
you
pay
for
d
get
trashed
beer
not
much
more
i
would
say
king
cobra
is
king
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
olde
english
800
and
those
of
that
ilk
are
undrinkable
for
me
gross
on
the
back
end
king
cobra
like
the
bros
say
has
a
clean
finish
smells
a
bit
funky
some
kind
of
sharpness
going
on
there
but
it
doesnt
taste
terrible
its
the
rough
equivalent
of
buying
a
40oz
of
bmc
no
better
no
worse
save
yourself
a
few
bucks
and
get
two
of
these
instead
of
a
sixer
of
coors
or
whatever
overall
drinkability
havent
had
this
since
i
was
17
which
is
about
a
decade
ago
turns
out
theres
a
pretty
good
reason
for
that
my
decision
to
rate
this
beer
makes
me
feel
like
a
dirty
beerkarma
slut
o
i
dont
like
this
beer
other
than
the
great
packaging
because
you
dont
want
to
mess
with
a
king
cobra
still
i
do
have
a
sweet
spot
in
my
heart
for
this
beer
as
it
is
the
beer
i
drank
the
most
of
before
i
turned
21
if
the
dollars
are
tight
and
your
not
a
beer
snob
this
is
a
must
try
just
dont
do
it
only
gunna
buy
again
for
drinking
games
or
if
i
wanna
get
effed
up
lol
not
the
tastiest
of
beers
but
its
not
like
i
couldnt
finish
it
its
whatever
considering
its
reputation
its
an
accomplishment
that
it
turns
out
for
the
style
not
bad
not
being
added
to
rotation
but
wasnt
a
total
waste
of
my
2
bucks
either
i
feel
like
if
it
had
a
touch
more
actual
malt
enough
to
bump
it
up
to
78
probably
it
could
catch
on
to
something
pours
a
typical
straw
yellow
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
no
lacing
smells
of
corn
and
a
little
grain
tastes
of
corn
and
grain
and
some
sweet
malts
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
and
has
a
heavy
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
poor
beer
and
ever
a
poor
representative
of
its
style
i
really
did
not
enjoy
it
he
only
thing
i
do
like
about
king
cobra
is
the
price
the
price
is
very
cheap
and
you
can
usually
get
them
for
about
2
dollars
i
think
that
king
cobra
would
only
give
me
a
good
buzz
if
i
drank
on
an
empty
stomach
and
i
downed
it
fast
other
than
that
it
didnt
give
me
a
good
buzz
i
didnt
really
like
the
taste
of
king
cobra
beer
the
taste
is
very
watery
its
not
a
really
bad
taste
like
211
but
it
lacks
any
flavor
decent
what
more
can
i
say
it
isnt
terrible
by
any
means
but
it
isnt
good
either
it
has
a
very
heavy
smell
and
taste
of
corn
adjunct
and
has
an
almost
tasteless
feel
going
down
however
once
the
brew
goes
down
the
taste
changes
leaving
an
aftertaste
in
your
mouth
for
a
while
the
swill
the
last
swallow
at
the
bottom
is
terrible
almost
makes
you
gag
very
carbonated
and
gives
you
a
very
crisp
feeling
in
your
mouth
its
decent
but
nothing
wonderful
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
fast
then
it
would
probably
work
but
other
than
that
dont
bother
otherwise
this
beer
lacks
the
creamy
nature
found
in
a
few
others
of
the
style
and
no
longer
bears
any
resemblance
to
your
standard
bud
might
be
me
might
be
the
beer
after
these
years
interestingly
this
beer
fills
out
a
bit
keeps
its
carbonation
and
becomes
more
balanced
well
through
50
degrees
rounding
out
the
aroma
and
feel
in
doing
so
flavor
still
falls
a
bit
short
of
average
the
final
entry
in
this
miniature
torture
chamber
known
as
swillfest
1
5
it
pours
a
clear
apple
juice
topped
by
around
a
finger
of
shortlived
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
corn
corn
syrup
lots
o
rice
and
hard
water
the
taste
holds
notes
of
vinyl
corn
wheat
and
rice
the
word
adjunct
comes
to
mind
dont
know
why
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
the
only
thing
this
really
has
going
for
it
is
its
low
price
but
even
at
such
a
bargain
basement
level
i
would
not
want
to
ever
revisit
this
purposely
this
beer
pours
a
clear
orange
golden
color
with
no
foam
at
all
the
smell
is
of
nothing
really
the
taste
is
mostly
of
malt
drink
there
really
is
no
other
way
to
discuss
this
beverage
somehow
its
not
the
worst
thing
that
ive
consumed
so
its
in
good
standing
in
my
mind
king
cobra
is
the
only
beer
i
buy
the
price
is
excellent
75
for
a
16oz
can
its
the
only
beer
that
has
that
full
taste
you
know
your
are
drinking
beer
when
you
drink
king
cobra
im
not
sure
about
the
appearance
because
i
only
buy
it
in
the
can
but
if
you
drink
king
cobra
regularly
youll
lose
your
taste
for
any
other
beers
because
they
are
so
weak
d
this
beer
is
exceptionally
easy
to
chug
but
i
dont
recommend
it
for
any
other
purposes
get
bitten
by
the
cobraaaa
taken
directly
from
the
bottle
look
bright
golden
color
with
many
threads
of
bubbles
smell
didnt
know
if
it
was
apple
soda
with
alcohol
or
malt
liquor
taste
sweet
malt
flavor
well
balanced
with
some
remnants
of
alcohol
mouthfeel
refreshing
bitter
sweet
and
some
times
too
sweet
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
drinkability
doesnt
cloying
like
other
malt
liquors
good
this
is
a
mass
produced
beer
for
one
who
needs
a
buzz
but
doesnt
have
the
funds
for
much
cheep
beer
cheep
flavor
first
of
all
there
is
very
little
respect
for
this
beer
by
the
brewers
seeing
it
is
in
a
clear
class
bottle
i
guess
one
step
down
from
the
can
as
the
can
does
not
let
light
spoil
the
taste
poured
it
from
this
big
32
oz
bottle
in
to
my
42
degree
mug
what
a
waste
i
should
have
drank
it
from
the
bottle
but
had
to
see
the
overall
appearance
not
the
head
was
one
and
a
half
fingers
of
soap
suds
that
vanished
before
my
eyes
and
the
color
was
about
the
lightest
i
have
ever
observed
at
4
on
the
srm
color
chart
weak
smell
of
wet
straw
and
malt
taste
well
not
much
of
that
but
what
there
was
not
too
bad
sweet
corn
wheat
malt
and
a
hint
of
rye
sort
of
a
balloon
feeling
in
my
mouth
expanding
pressure
but
no
tingle
i
am
very
thankful
i
can
purchase
better
beers
than
this
but
for
the
price
and
the
buzz
factor
good
bang
for
the
buck
but
if
i
am
looking
for
flavor
i
will
look
elsewhere
d
avoid
at
all
costs
i
drank
more
than
a
couple
of
these
as
an
undergraduate
but
never
because
they
tasted
good
maturity
and
a
more
discerning
palate
have
reduced
this
to
simply
unpalatable
this
is
a
straight
wino
beer
it
has
to
be
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
theres
nothing
great
about
it
the
malt
taste
like
garbage
and
dirt
if
you
like
cheap
malt
beer
buy
mikieys
that
at
least
has
a
good
taste
just
avoid
this
beer
at
all
cost
d
drinkability
on
the
other
hand
is
just
on
the
wrong
side
of
average
overall
this
may
have
been
the
worst
of
the
bunch
just
not
something
i
would
ever
go
back
to
drinkability
is
just
ok
for
me
it
does
go
down
quite
easy
and
there
really
isnt
anything
offensive
about
it
however
there
is
nothing
about
it
that
would
make
me
want
go
out
and
get
it
again
but
for
the
style
certainly
not
the
worst
ive
had
from
the
40
ouncer
sampled
on
memorial
day
2010
it
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
puffy
white
head
that
bubbles
away
little
by
little
the
aroma
is
machineprocessed
malts
grassy
and
rather
skunky
the
taste
is
a
bit
better
on
the
maltiness
with
an
obvious
alcohol
note
you
get
what
you
pay
for
and
i
paid
1
99
d
just
far
too
sweet
for
me
but
fairly
unoffensive
as
far
the
style
goes
cheers
this
beer
is
absolute
shit
if
the
smell
alone
doesnt
cause
immediate
vomiting
dont
worry
its
on
the
way
i
would
rather
drink
hobo
piss
than
drink
this
beer
it
would
probably
contain
more
natural
ingredients
than
this
toxic
soup
masquerading
as
a
malt
liquor
if
youre
getting
it
for
the
right
reasons
you
wont
be
upset
but
if
youre
looking
for
a
sippin
beer
then
find
another
brew
topperxichipsiapr

its
most

i
did
have
some
of
this
stuff
to
go
with

is

5its
not
so
much
that
this
is
horrible
and
too
much
alcohol
for
the
body
the
feel
is
thin
and
mildly
gaginducing
the
alcohol
and
other
bad
qualities
grow
as
i
make
my
way
through
a
glass
speaking
of
which
appearance
and
everything
is
rubbish
i
am
drinking
a
forty
of
it
its
bad
dont
drink
this
uness
you
are
about
out
go
out
for
a
night
on
the
town
and
are
short
on
cash
its
beer
and
of
course
for
the
reason
for
drinking
yes
it
has
alcohol
in
it
yes
it
will
get
you
a
buzz
for
little
dough
my
main
complaint
is
the
taste
normally
with
cheap
brews
like
this
you
get
at
least
some
kinda
funky
aftertaste
or
something
but
with
king
cobra
nothing
tastes
like
water
with
a
hardly
any
malt
or
anything
its
like
busch
just
gave
up
after
putting
alcohol
and
coloring
in
the
bottle
i
paid
1
19
for
40
oz
of
this
1000
pm
on
a
hot
summer
night
with
a
couple
of
close
friends
lighting
up
some
coals
and
cooking
up
late
night
burgers
and
dogs
dont
be
surprised
to
find
me
on
the
patio
swing
with
a
40
of
cobra
at
my
side
mouthfeel
is
crisp
from
carbonation
but
offensive
from
everything
else
lingering
gross
adjuncty
flavor
makes
the
mouth
go
downhill
drinkablity
is
low
indeed
drinkability
is
good
for
a
cheap
dollar
spent
its
best
for
sports
events
and
just
wanting
a
quick
cheap
buzz
to
spark
amongst
friends
otherwise
this
stuff
is
just
for
the
cheap
dollars
at
heart
d
drinks
like
water
drinks
average
what
kind
of
malt
liquor
has
a
5
9
abv
isnt
the
point
of
this
stuff
to
get
intoxicated
a
nasty
golden
color
with
no
head
the
nose
is
bitter
with
some
malty
syrup
presence
taste
is
of
rotting
vegatables
thick
yet
really
carbonated
stay
away
from
this
monster
the
taste
is
worse
watery
and
bland
its
almost
salty
at
first
then
metallic
and
soapy
with
an
unpleasant
chemical
sharpness
in
the
finish
before
an
exceedingly
faint
brief
corn
element
but
even
this
is
both
faint
and
brief
poured
a
sickly
yellow
no
head
skunky
flavoring
watery
mouthfeel
ah
good
memories
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
though
still
pretty
terrible
this
to
me
is
the
most
gutteral
of
the
40
oz
malt
liquors
i
always
rate
40s
on
their
color
not
how
they
pour
because
you
dont
pour
40s
it
is
like
budweisers
run
off
that
they
catch
and
bottle
for
cheap
this
stuff
has
a
decent
golden
color
for
malt
liquor
and
the
smell
is
like
other
malt
liquor
40s
you
know
real
alkie
this
one
has
the
worst
taste
though
to
me
at
least
it
seems
a
little
slimy
and
then
theres
this
dryness
left
in
my
mouth
i
never
made
it
through
a
full
one
yet
wo
just
dumping
the
last
10
ounces
piss
warm
by
this
time
and
grabbing
something
else
ah
king
cobra
how
do
you
do
weve
met
many
times
before
but
not
for
over
a
year
born
on
date
of
17
july
07
maybe
that
would
explain
the
subtle
skunkiness
not
really
much
else
btw
im
drinking
this
how
a
malt
liqour
should
be
drank
out
of
the
bottle
clear
yellow
tastes
like
a
grown
up
bud
with
much
more
sweetness
there
really
isnt
much
to
this
not
much
smell
not
much
taste
just
extra
alcohol
be
careful
though
of
the
king
of
the
snakes
its
venom
can
be
dangerous
pours
goldenyellow
with
sudsywhite
head
and
good
lace
harsh
aroma
of
grains
hops
and
possibly
industrial
solvents
and
oils
the
mouthfeel
has
almost
no
character
turns
to
water
in
the
mouth
the
best
although
nothing
great
part
is
the
flavor
malty
hops
lemon
some
bitterness
overall
a
pretty
weak
beer
yet
it
is
drinkable
unlike
some
other
cheap
malt
liquors
not
recommended
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
overall
forget
caged
corks
screw
tops
say
class
like
nothing
else
anyway
if
your
mo
is
to
get
fd
up
for
cheap
this
is
not
the
best
way
to
go
the
6
abv
isnt
worth
it
there
are
scads
of
domestic
ice
beers
with
5
5
that
are
bettertasting
relatively
speaking
and
other
highgravity
or
malt
liquors
that
are
higher
in
abv
and
probably
better
as
well
avoid
dont
even
bother
pouring
king
cobra
out
of
the
40
lets
not
get
rediculous
this
is
a
malt
liquor
were
talking
about
and
it
doesnt
worry
about
presentation
too
much
the
appearance
is
bland
the
smell
is
terrible
and
the
taste
is
suprisingly
better
than
some
of
the
ab
beers
imo
i
hate
macro
lagers
and
most
malt
liquor
but
for
some
reason
i
have
a
weakness
for
king
cobra
it
goes
down
smooth
as
long
as
its
cold
and
doesnt
get
too
nasty
when
it
warms
up
for
under
2
a
bottle
it
is
a
good
way
to
get
toasted
without
breaking
the
bank
and
once
again
it
is
not
only
cheaper
but
more
drinkable
than
a
lot
of
macro
lagers
or
light
lagers
king
cobra
premium
malt
liquor
pours
a
pale
orange
with
a
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
the
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
the
taste
is
a
bit
fruity
too
followed
by
grain
interesting
to
revisit
this
one
it
was
my
go
to
40
oz
in
college
when
id
have
to
dig
up
change
to
find
enough
money
to
go
buy
a
beer
i
still
think
its
pretty
drinkable
for
a
malt
liquor
in
search
of
the
decent
cheapo
this
one
is
pale
strawyellow
with
a
medium
white
foamy
quickly
diminishing
head
the
smell
is
wow
not
bad
for
a
cheap
malt
liquor
not
the
corn
and
strong
alcohol
im
used
to
instead
a
mild
but
decent
grainy
malt
with
some
doughy
yeast
i
think
i
even
detect
a
very
slight
wisp
of
citrus
from
the
hops
taste
is
again
surprisingly
decent
more
of
the
same
bready
a
little
corn
with
a
late
tinge
of
hop
citrus
and
dryness
not
much
but
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
eh
as
it
warms
it
starts
to
let
out
a
bit
of
that
adjunctladen
stink
too
bad
i
was
starting
to
like
this
beer
thin
body
texture
is
a
bit
watery
moderate
carbonation
this
one
actually
impressed
me
a
little
at
1
75
for
a
40
and
with
a
name
like
king
cobra
i
was
expecting
something
that
would
really
bite
but
this
was
actually
a
little
enjoyable
nothing
i
would
recommend
or
anything
but
the
realm
of
cheapos
this
one
is
not
too
shabby
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
like
malt
liquors
but
prefer
less
intimidating
and
full
flavored
ones
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
plenty
of
carbonation
nothing
special
nothing
bad
here
there
is
a
modicum
of
malt
in
the
nose
but
the
adjuncts
maybe
corn
appear
also
i
was
expecting
refrigerated
liquified
sterno
for
the
taste
but
instead
was
met
with
a
clean
light
bodied
lager
taste
there
was
a
bit
of
alcohol
at
the
end
and
the
riciness
was
clear
in
the
crispy
and
thinning
mouthfeel
this
was
not
as
terrible
as
i
had
expected
it
did
taste
different
than
its
sister
hurricane
which
was
much
more
fuel
flavored
certainly
nothing
i
would
buy
or
recommend
but
if
you
are
looking
for
something
to
compare
a
craft
malt
liquor
such
as
daddys
little
helper
or
liquor
de
malt
then
this
is
worth
the
1
50
or
so
youll
pay
for
a
40
ounce
bottle
available
at
finer
highway
gas
stations
where
beer
is
sold
a
pretty
rough
brew
on
the
bottle
it
claims
it
is
malt
liquor
however
it
tastes
like
kerosene
but
it
is
tolerable
if
youre
low
on
cash
you
can
buy
three
of
them
for
around
5
bucks
so
if
you
just
want
to
get
drunk
its
a
pretty
dang
good
choice
i
have
battled
many
cobras
and
usurped
many
a
king
but
never
had
i
topped
myself
by
going
toe
to
toe
with
the
king
cobra
i
met
a
19
year
old
girl
from
west
virginia
who
confessed
that
her
favorite
was
king
cobra
and
sparks
and
some
think
women
have
no
guts
for
the
beer
battlefield
first
before
we
add
our
assent
to
previous
reviews
one
must
know
the
proper
way
to
coax
this
dangerous
serpent
out
of
its
basket
if
a
hand
held
wind
reed
or
brass
instrument
is
not
available
play
the
payback
album
by
james
brown
on
your
stereo
drink
cool
and
allow
to
get
warm
by
midserving
in
order
for
the
venom
to
take
optimal
effect
if
three
of
these
do
not
wipe
out
all
vestiges
of
your
inner
prevaricating
beer
geeky
self
then
you
have
no
soul
left
to
save
another
malt
liquor
like
you
really
need
another
one
after
hurricane
appears
a
clear
glden
tone
with
a
large
white
head
leaves
behind
even
lace
but
it
dwindles
quickly
aroma
has
a
slight
metallic
grainy
note
that
has
a
sort
of
semi
sweet
alcohol
corn
and
rice
appeal
to
it
and
of
course
cooked
veggies
with
a
touch
of
fruity
tart
apple
flavors
collide
to
form
a
harsh
metallic
grainy
offness
on
the
palate
wow
this
is
rediculous
has
how
bad
it
is
but
a
mild
sweet
tone
with
evident
alcohol
and
finishes
with
a
very
chemical
edge
to
it
definitely
will
induce
a
headache
drinking
this
stuff
on
the
regular
mouthfeel
has
high
carbonation
light
bodied
some
stickiness
to
it
all
but
cmon
another
beer
within
the
same
damn
style
drinkability
mass
produced
malt
liquor
beer
you
buy
when
your
broke
and
dont
care
about
taste
what
more
can
be
said
this
one
sucks
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
into
the
glass
this
is
somewhat
misleading
as
it
appears
to
be
a
darker
nearbronze
in
the
bottle
because
of
the
clear
glass
and
the
dark
label
shadowing
the
yellow
beer
the
best
part
of
the
appearance
is
some
good
retention
but
on
a
secondrate
head
as
for
the
smell
its
virtually
nonexistant
a
very
faint
whiff
of
malts
and
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
malty
and
smooth
but
again
lacks
in
substance
the
mouthfeel
just
screams
ab
at
you
drinkable
if
you
can
tolerate
the
taste
after
a
while
d
very
low
unless
you
are
on
a
budget
this
stuff
sure
does
what
it
claims
to
do
i
drank
this
while
watching
a
movie
and
by
the
end
of
cheaper
by
the
dozen
i
was
pretty
damn
cooked
i
must
say
that
its
one
of
the
better
40
oz
cheapo
brews
though
d
for
the
style
it
is
very
drinkable
for
a
beer
id
rather
go
with
some
flavor
notes
drank
strait
from
the
bottle
no
pouring
going
on
here
pale
gold
tan
head
little
lace
aroma
is
a
nice
blend
of
crisp
cool
freshness
exotic
spices
sensual
woods
and
seductive
musk
it
gives
a
fresh
warm
sensation
the
flavor
really
surprised
me
sexy
citrus
lavender
and
woods
top
notes
play
with
pistachio
leaves
iced
lavender
chinese
ginger
and
mandarin
peel
following
up
are
middle
notes
of
celery
greens
wild
tiger
lily
indian
basil
and
kashmir
saffron
the
finale
comes
clean
with
brisk
bristlecone
pine
patchouli
and
clear
musk
notes
interesting
to
say
the
least
i
thanked
my
friend
for
this
smooth
tasting
premium
malt
liquor
naturally
brewed
from
select
ingredients
for
my
drinking
pleasure
and
complete
satisfaction
next
time
ill
opt
for
the
glass
of
water
thanks
had
one
of
these
on
the
way
to
campground
this
weekend
for
1
00
this
was
not
half
bad
king
cobra
is
light
to
midbodied
with
what
i
like
to
call
a
sting
got
a
bit
of
an
alcoholic
kick
to
it
the
snake
does
not
play
around
and
right
around
6
it
gets
the
job
done
heavy
malt
but
not
excessively
sweet
quite
balanced
with
a
sweeping
discreet
hop
bitter
that
balances
it
out
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
drinkability
is
superb
i
am
a
sucker
for
new
beers
and
this
one
definitely
caught
my
eye
in
all
honesty
this
brew
suprised
me
i
was
expecting
much
worse
drinkability
this
is
really
not
very
good
but
hey
it
was
1
29
what
did
i
expect
i
am
worried
however
that
i
wont
be
able
to
finish
all
32
ounces
twisted
the
top
off
the
40oz
clear
bottle
with
freshness
dae
of
jan
11
06
the
color
of
the
beer
doesnt
look
so
bad
but
that
because
of
the
wide
bottle
first
sip
was
from
bottle
as
i
think
this
is
the
natural
way
for
the
style
more
flavor
than
i
expected
but
not
exaclty
a
good
thing
alcohol
is
present
and
gives
it
a
fuller
mouthfeel
a
malty
sweetness
and
lots
of
grains
in
this
one
i
feel
guilty
for
reviewing
this
beer
because
i
could
be
spending
my
time
reviewing
a
beer
worth
reviewing
but
this
isnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
for
1
50
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
get
again
but
if
i
had
to
choose
this
or
a
40oz
bud
for
a
dollar
more
i
might
pick
the
bargain
nuff
said
on
this
crap
served
at
extremely
cold
head
is
actually
gross
looking
looks
like
soap
bubbles
served
from
32
oz
non
returneable
bottle
smells
like
burnt
nastiness
tastes
like
cardboard
it
really
does
very
fizzy
after
a
few
sips
it
tastes
like
cardboard
dubbed
with
dogcrap
a
beer
made
for
the
afroamericans
consumers
without
offense
is
rare
in
my
country
only
sold
in
usa
i
buy
in
the
border
appearance
smell
and
drinkability
its
over
the
average
its
taste
is
rich
in
sugar
flavor
mouthfeel
different
like
a
german
malt
liquor
not
recommended
with
food
only
with
buddies
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentyfour
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
watered
down
taste
im
surprised
to
see
it
is
5
9
as
it
seems
like
im
drinking
a
glass
of
juice
it
has
the
mouthfeel
of
carbonated
apple
juice
mixed
5050
with
water
finishes
with
an
off
corn
flavor
and
its
gone
towards
the
end
of
this
40
it
gets
syrupy
and
is
almost
undrinkable
as
it
warms
avoid
oh
how
bad
this
is
the
second
worst
malt
liquor
i
have
had
in
my
life
skunky
and
rotten
high
abv
and
cloying
in
every
sene
of
the
words
cliche
yellow
color
aroma
and
taste
make
you
gag
very
bad
this
is
definitely
a
can
of
beer
to
get
drunk
with
on
a
budget
roughly
1
19
a
24
oz
can
this
beer
pours
a
very
light
straw
colored
yellow
it
looks
like
water
with
a
little
food
coloring
to
it
the
head
is
white
and
lifeless
it
fades
very
quick
leaving
no
laces
the
first
thing
i
think
of
when
i
smell
this
stuff
is
rotting
sewage
it
smells
like
rotton
corn
and
dirty
water
i
dont
smell
any
hops
i
dont
smell
any
redeaming
qualities
at
all
i
am
slightly
scared
to
taste
this
stuff
again
first
taste
isnt
too
bad
not
good
by
any
means
but
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
it
has
a
corn
flavor
i
guess
that
would
be
because
it
is
made
with
corn
it
is
not
hoppy
at
all
i
detect
absolutely
no
spicy
flavor
also
i
cant
taste
any
malty
flavors
it
tastes
very
much
like
everything
that
anheuserbusch
makes
this
beer
is
carbonated
decently
i
guess
it
would
in
my
opinion
make
an
awfull
session
beer
i
will
probably
never
drink
it
again
it
is
low
in
alcohol
though
so
to
those
that
like
anheuserbusch
products
it
might
be
a
good
session
beer
i
know
i
used
to
drink
4
or
5
40s
in
a
night
much
to
my
regrets
in
the
morning
i
would
recomend
staying
away
from
this
one
stick
to
urine
it
probably
tastes
better
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
lace
for
a
head
a
lot
of
carbonation
smells
like
sweet
corn
and
a
bit
of
grassy
grains
light
bodied
taste
like
sweet
corn
and
grassy
grains
has
a
warm
alcohol
effect
hmmm
well
this
beer
was
the
first
beer
i
had
ever
tasted
and
that
was
when
i
was
about
12
not
much
has
changed
since
then
if
you
want
a
cheap
buzz
with
minimal
flavor
then
this
is
your
beer
the
names
king
cobra
and
i
gotta
agree
this
stuff
looks
pretty
poisonous
comes
in
a
24
ounce
can
never
the
sign
of
a
quality
brew
smells
like
snake
venom
holy
smokes
the
taste
is
rough
damn
ive
admittedly
had
some
extremely
bad
beers
but
this
one
is
probably
as
bad
as
they
get
excluding
cave
creek
of
course
after
further
consideration
beside
the
cave
creek
this
is
hands
down
the
worst
beer
that
i
have
had
it
sinks
its
fangs
in
you
deep
and
trys
to
kill
you
tastes
like
liquid
corn
really
not
a
whole
lot
to
this
one
as
far
as
flavor
still
the
bare
fact
that
it
doesnt
taste
outright
putrid
is
something
to
be
proud
of
with
a
malt
liquor
could
be
a
lot
worse
basically
tastes
like
one
of
anheuserbuschs
standard
offerings
only
with
the
alcohol
jacked
up
king
cobra
should
die
a
quick
and
painless
death
im
not
completely
heartless
wheres
a
pissed
off
mongoose
when
you
need
one
drinkability
i
cant
see
it
this
may
have
its
contingent
perhaps
the
diehard
ab
crowd
from
the
can
its
not
bad
but
its
lifeless
for
any
purpose
beyond
basic
inebriation
by
the
way
king
cobra
has
the
ugliest
beer
bottle
i
have
ever
seen
it
has
a
dark
snakeskin
design
on
the
label
with
unatractive
lettering
i
guess
its
actually
about
perfect
for
this
type
of
beer
the
appearance
of
this
stuff
is
a
faint
golden
smell
was
hard
to
detect
at
1st
i
practically
had
to
dip
my
nose
in
the
stuff
but
what
i
came
out
with
was
a
faintly
fruity
sweet
smell
taste
was
not
that
goodhad
a
real
interesting
aftertaste
couldt
put
my
finger
on
it
but
a
hint
of
licorice
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
and
slightly
creamy
drinkability
not
too
great
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
but
if
your
just
looking
for
a
cheap
buzz
then
not
badgod
its
been
a
rough
week
not
a
beer
i
would
buy
again
but
t
tell
the
truth
its
an
ok
malt
liquor
better
than
budweiser
drinkable
like
a
budweiser
but
budweiser
ice
tastes
much
better
this
beer
was
best
served
from
the
old
opaque
brown
bottle
why
they
switched
to
a
clear
bottle
is
beyond
me
maybe
because
of
its
surprisingly
almostappealing
golden
color
smells
slightly
sour
like
the
malt
has
gone
bad
tastes
like
the
rebrewed
swill
off
the
top
of
a
vat
of
michelob
rumor
has
it
it
is
highly
carbonated
its
only
saving
graces
are
that
its
fairly
smooth
for
a
a
malt
liquor
and
it
wont
give
you
the
runs
like
old
english
this
beer
is
best
not
tasted
its
basically
piss
in
a
bottle
there
is
not
much
else
to
say
about
it
the
only
real
reason
to
drink
this
is
for
a
joke
or
something
it
works
if
your
going
for
thug
appeal
of
course
that
only
works
if
you
are
drinking
it
from
a
40
oz
bottle
no
after
taste
no
personality
and
on
the
8th
day
as
a
joke
god
created
king
cobra
and
then
he
laughed
what
is
this
evil
liquid
being
on
a
40oz
kick
as
i
had
been
i
tried
this
poison
and
well
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
the
color
was
a
yellow
9
type
color
the
smell
was
a
bit
pungent
but
not
scary
then
came
the
taste
it
has
a
real
copper
penny
like
taste
like
blood
almost
it
is
plain
nasty
only
a
booze
hound
sitting
on
the
corner
of
the
old
woolworths
on
washington
st
near
down
town
crossing
could
enjoy
this
but
id
toss
him
the
extra
buck
to
get
the
st
ides
its
an
interesting
brew
because
its
fairly
well
done
yet
it
doesnt
hit
the
mark
its
subdued
enough
that
at
first
sip
it
seems
almost
like
a
regular
beer
yet
it
quickly
turns
to
show
many
of
the
negatives
associated
with
the
malt
liquor
style
its
a
little
bit
more
drinkable
than
some
due
to
its
less
sweet
nature
yet
it
offers
less
character
an
odd
catch22
faced
with
a
doubledoored
cooler
full
of
malt
liquors
i
think
id
look
for
something
else
first
this
stuff
is
dirt
cheap
and
there
is
a
legitimate
reason
why
light
gold
color
strong
odor
of
malt
and
a
taste
similar
to
what
i
imagine
rotting
corn
to
taste
like
this
may
be
good
for
college
students
looking
to
get
a
buzz
when
short
on
cash
but
i
think
outside
of
that
its
a
waste
of
money
they
say
a
cobras
bite
is
deadly
but
i
think
its
the
taste
with
this
crap
i
could
barely
finish
a
14
of
the
can
before
i
felt
like
hurling
it
gives
you
a
buzz
right
away
but
so
does
exhaust
fumes
next
time
ill
just
stick
my
head
in
the
oven
after
sampling
a
few
malt
liquors
and
tasting
a
few
that
werent
half
bad
ive
found
one
thats
real
bad
king
cobra
this
is
a
lame
excuse
for
a
beer
not
to
mention
not
even
living
up
to
malt
liquor
standards
at
least
the
other
malt
liquors
had
some
character
this
has
no
aroma
no
head
no
taste
no
alcohol
kick
no
life
ive
always
been
shy
about
ripping
on
anheuserbusch
because
i
actually
like
and
drink
quite
a
bit
of
budweiser
but
kc
is
truly
crap
beer
ranks
down
at
the
bottom
with
busch
and
natural
light
horrible
notes
the
name
says
it
all
and
who
they
are
marketing
for
as
for
the
quality
if
you
like
to
drink
flavourless
beer
with
a
kick
of
alcohol
this
is
for
you
in
conclusion
there
are
better
options
out
there
even
for
cheap
beverages
but
this
is
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
expected
out
of
a
natty
brand
they
did
something
right
here
and
i
tip
my
hat
to
them
for
that
this
is
not
good
beer
not
at
all
but
its
not
terrible
either
well
yeah
its
kind
of
terrible
but
it
goes
down
easy
there
are
some
decent
fruity
flavors
there
and
its
cheap
so
if
you
want
some
inexpensive
beer
with
a
kick8
abv
this
is
for
you
otherwise
i
dont
recommend
it
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
even
at
a
mere
6
percent
abv
could
be
dangerous
i
think
ive
discovered
my
new
favorite
ultracheap
beer
overall
i
live
in
a
college
town
and
the
street
are
littered
with
these
each
and
every
friday
and
saturday
night
so
they
must
be
doing
something
right
and
at
least
theyre
cans
rather
than
glass
ill
pass
but
ill
also
say
that
its
far
from
the
worst
malt
liquor
ive
ever
tasted
o
this
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
natty
light
the
sweet
taste
up
front
isnt
that
bad
actually
but
the
finish
tastes
just
as
offputting
as
natty
light
a
good
way
to
get
drunk
but
thats
about
it
for
a
cheap
1
79
can
at
8
its
really
not
that
bad
if
youre
okay
with
drinking
cheap
domestics
this
one
does
just
fine
packs
a
decent
punch
average
malty
taste
nothing
too
exciting
once
you
get
to
the
bottom
and
its
not
ice
cold
anymore
it
is
almost
unbearable
to
drink
this
beer
has
a
light
taste
for
a
barley
beer
and
a
satisfying
after
taste
8
was
a
wow
factor
too
i
always
did
get
more
of
a
buzz
from
5
beer
than
i
did
from
12
wine
or
40
scotch
for
some
strange
reason
one
of
these
natty
daddy
beers
is
quite
satisfying
for
the
night
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
i
am
not
one
to
pour
out
a
beer
but
halfway
thru
this
huge
can
and
i
started
to
develop
a
headache
instant
hangover
in
a
can
had
to
go
down
the
drain
just
awful
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
to
beer
fair
any
beer
called
natty
daddy
needs
no
other
criticism
i
drank
this
at
a
pitt
tailgate
and
much
like
english
bob
i
walked
up
slowly
on
the
beer
tubbecause
i
was
drunk
i
bought
this
drunk
and
drank
it
the
next
morning
and
for
a
1
82
i
kinda
liked
it
really
sweet
and
ok
when
ice
cold
once
it
gets
warmer
its
terrible
really
this
is
a
fine
beer
for
what
it
is
which
is
to
say
hiccup
if
you
are
looking
to
get
hammered
on
hiccup
the
cheap
this
is
the
hiccup
beer
for
hiccup
you
there
is
nothing
offensive
or
even
remotely
so
except
for
the
flavor
on
the
can
from
the
constant
smell
of
the
place
that
i
bought
it
it
isnt
good
beer
but
it
is
fine
for
what
it
is
drinkable
extremely
cold
and
a
nice
buzz
at
a
low
price
if
thats
your
goal
not
my
favorite
by
any
stretch
the
appearance
was
a
hazy
pale
yellow
with
no
head
and
flat
looking
the
smell
is
all
booze
with
no
hopmalt
or
anything
else
to
speak
of
maybe
a
little
rice
the
taste
wasnt
good
either
mainly
starting
off
weak
with
light
rice
flavor
and
then
a
heavy
booze
finish
overall
i
think
ill
stop
taking
freebies
from
salesmen
for
a
little
bit
i
do
drink
this
beer
i
enjoy
the
heck
out
of
it
in
the
right
circumstances
i
truly
love
good
beers
and
ales
this
is
not
one
of
them
it
does
however
have
it
place
as
a
quick
hit
malt
liquor
that
will
put
the
crowd
in
the
mood
it
is
similar
to
fireball
as
compare
to
decent
whiskey
it
has
it
place
as
a
party
starter
overall
this
beer
will
remain
with
me
throughout
my
life
ok
lets
face
it
manthis
is
not
a
beer
you
drink
and
savor
the
flavorthis
is
a
malt
liquor
you
chill
ice
f87king
cold
and
slam
it
will
get
you
where
you
want
to
be
very
fastand
for
about
a
buck
25
a
25oz
can
what
can
you
bitch
about
you
must
drink
this
stuff
ice
coldbecause
as
it
warms
it
gets
that
malt
liquor
sweetsicknasty
tatse
to
it
yuck
but
ice
cold
not
half
bad
alland
it
will
kick
your
ass
so
know
this
lmaobeerwolf666jammimg
some
the
morningside
14
iknow
alot
of
folks
look
down
on
this
one
but
for
what
it
isit
is
out
standing
here
i
can
get
my
local
grocery
store
sells
it
at
1
09
a
25oz
can
and
with
there
store
deal
card
they
take
10c
off
thatso
10
00
about
takes
care
of
your
weekend
beer
buzz
because
you
only
need
34
of
these
to
get
where
you
want
to
be
if
a
cheap
high
is
what
you
are
seeking
this
is
not
a
beer
for
someone
looking
to
savor
but
with
a
pizza
and
movie
if
your
looking
to
sleep
good
it
works
its
cheap
it
does
the
job
there
is
nothing
to
hate
about
it
it
is
what
is
is
a
inexpensive
high
alcohol
beer
that
will
get
you
drunk
if
you
are
strictly
a
craft
beer
drinker
yeah
you
wont
like
it
cause
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
craft
but
overall
for
the
price
and
the
alcohol
percent
you
will
have
a
hard
to
time
beat
it
o
for
what
this
is
it
isnt
exactly
bad
when
i
hear
people
say
this
is
the
worst
beer
ever
i
have
to
wonder
if
theyve
live
sheltered
beer
lives
as
there
is
plenty
that
make
this
stuff
look
like
a
world
class
brew
bottom
line
is
that
for
what
it
is
it
is
pretty
good
natty
daddy
is
death
in
a
can
made
by
anheuser
busch
8
1
abv
for
the
money
you
will
get
messed
up
fucked
up
over
all
this
a
beer
you
buy
when
you
want
one
beer
not
the
greatest
but
not
the
worst
out
there
taste
is
heavy
and
bitter
the
color
is
darker
than
natural
ice
and
bud
ice
mouth
feel
was
ok
pours
with
a
scanty
head
of
white
on
a
clear
straw
colored
body
no
retention
no
lace
an
aroma
of
weak
apple
juicecheap
champagne
the
flavor
is
more
watered
down
apple
juice
with
notes
of
nail
polish
remover
and
sadness
medium
body
fairly
high
carbonation
and
a
slightly
sweet
finish
this
is
unusually
bad
to
the
point
that
i
actually
laughed
out
loud
when
i
first
tasted
it
not
sure
what
the
point
of
this
product
is
since
they
already
make
other
high
gravity
malt
liquors
that
dont
suck
quite
as
much
as
this
one
honestly
these
beers
arent
that
bad
they
are
not
for
a
light
weight
because
of
their
heavier
alcohol
content
in
my
opinion
if
you
cant
handle
a
natty
daddy
you
shouldnt
be
drinking
alcohol
at
all
so
yea
drink
on
friends
and
be
safe
much
love
o
im
just
going
to
finish
this
can
aaand
im
buzzing
o
for
a
malt
liquor
this
one
is
really
not
that
bad
it
is
drinkable
and
the
flavors
are
not
overly
intense
with
the
alcohol
being
fairly
well
hidden
which
is
unusual
for
the
style
overall
for
an
american
malt
liquor
it
is
quite
good
not
going
to
fill
the
refrigerator
with
the
stuff
but
is
is
better
than
95
of
what
you
will
find
they
were
out
of
keystone
ice
and
i
spied
these
little
gems
priced
3
for
3
i
grew
up
on
mickies
and
colt45
so
i
am
not
adverse
to
a
little
buzz
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
it
was
not
at
all
super
skunky
or
burny
i
have
had
occasion
to
sip
a
camo
beer
and
this
was
no
where
near
the
horrid
bilge
that
stuff
is
nowadays
beer
comes
in
different
colors
flavors
alc
s
etc
this
at
least
comes
across
as
resembling
the
original
german
style
beverage
this
product
is
great
for
what
it
is
a
cheap
highoctane
malt
liquor
thats
easy
to
swallow
and
carries
a
heavy
punch
its
best
for
those
days
when
you
want
to
get
drunk
quickly
for
under
four
dollars
around
here
a
can
usually
costs
under
2
dollars
and
when
i
drink
it
quickly
gives
me
a
pretty
nice
buzz
two
cans
and
im
officially
drunk
sure
its
not
the
best
tasting
beer
but
what
do
you
expect
for
something
that
costs
less
than
most
big
bottles
of
soda
this
is
my
goto
cheapass
beer
this
is
by
far
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
it
is
straw
colored
it
kind
of
smells
like
plastic
you
can
smell
the
alcohol
in
it
the
taste
is
kind
of
sour
i
took
about
2
drinks
of
it
and
got
almost
instant
gut
rot
it
might
make
me
really
sick
if
i
drank
a
whole
one
overall
its
a
strong
beer
to
get
you
drunk
as
someone
else
mentioned
the
can
states
its
both
a
lager
and
an
ale
which
is
pretty
funny
drink
this
sucker
cold
overall
i
dont
claim
to
have
tried
all
the
malt
bombs
available
but
this
is
at
least
average
so
far
you
can
tell
it
is
related
to
natural
light
ice
i
go
to
bed
and
fall
asleep
pretty
quickly
and
dont
wake
up
till
6
or
7
am
i
recommend
this
for
people
who
would
like
to
get
buzzed
fast
or
would
like
to
catch
a
buzz
on
a
budget
this
will
get
you
drunk
okay
let
me
start
out
by
saying
i
have
drank
everything
from
boones
farm
to
the
highest
end
single
malt
scotch
i
am
a
big
fan
of
natural
ice
so
i
saw
this
and
i
had
to
try
it
i
will
agree
it
is
definitely
no
natural
ice
but
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
is
a
quick
buzz
in
a
can
or
2
to
3
cans
whatever
anyways
for
what
it
is
it
is
not
half
bad
but
if
i
had
a
few
extra
bucks
i
would
just
slam
a
12
pack
of
natural
ice
and
call
it
a
sure
thing
well
folks
i
am
a
retired
chemistry
teacher
now
working
as
a
chef
in
a
restaurant
that
now
sells
beer
to
go
i
guess
that
my
attention
was
piqued
by
the
nattydaddy
display
which
highlighted
the
8
0
alcohol
by
volume
content
so
yep
i
bought
a
24
ounce
can
the
taste
was
horrible
to
me
like
liquid
aluminum
but
the
8
worked
its
magic
so
your
choice
is
obviously
taste
or
effect
or
is
it
affect
oh
yea
we
sell
it
for
1
29
for
a
24
ounce
can
haha
all
you
arrogant
so
called
beer
connoisseurs
would
be
begging
for
an
ice
cold
24oz
can
of
natty
daddy
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
you
were
without
and
you
would
love
every
drop
of
its
perfectly
intoxicating
effects
had
to
give
this
beer
all
5
to
offset
all
the
undeserved
haters
this
is
a
mega
brewed
beer
you
should
rate
accordingly
and
not
go
comparing
it
to
craft
beers
it
does
a
great
job
at
being
what
it
is
meant
to
be
so
go
buy
a
24oz
natty
daddy
and
revel
in
its
perfectly
intoxicating
glory
its
a
ok
not
horrible
not
great
but
ok
for
a
high
gravity
poured
this
american
malt
liquor
from
a
22
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
produced
a
small
white
head
poor
retention
and
it
left
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
light
malt
adjuncts
not
much
doing
light
in
body
this
brew
had
a
foundation
of
thin
malted
grain
there
is
just
a
touch
of
hops
semi
sweet
watery
thin
not
much
flavor
to
speak
of
another
weak
offering
from
ab
anheuserbusch
natty
daddy
25
natty
daddy
is
what
i
said
it
is
and
what
everybody
thinks
of
it
as
a
beer
for
a
buzz
at
8
itll
do
the
job
its
not
a
beer
to
drink
when
you
want
to
enjoy
what
youre
drinking
ah
come
on
people
this
is
a
beer
reviewing
website
yes
this
is
cheap
bottom
shelf
beer
yes
it
is
definitely
not
high
brow
beer
but
you
know
what
this
beer
isnt
anywhere
as
bad
as
all
the
1
scores
it
has
received
this
beer
is
for
quick
buzz
drinkers
or
maybe
a
party
day
at
the
river
this
is
not
an
aficionado
beer
anyways
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
malty
color
it
is
nearly
clear
in
appearance
has
a
very
acidic
mouth
feel
it
is
strong
on
the
tongue
and
has
an
overabundance
of
froth
and
lace
this
beer
is
nowhere
near
world
class
but
it
is
nowhere
near
the
worst
of
the
world
class
handsome
blue
can
24
ozs
from
a
local
711
type
1

this
better
be
good
1

for
this
type
of
beer
no
idea
of
the
colour
as
i
have
this
from
the
can
wrapped
in
the
proper
brown
bag
aroma
i
can
make
out
is
sweet
maltsperfumy
thats
about
it
taste
sweet
semi
sweet
appleslight
tobacco
a
little
toasted
bread
a
tiny
bit
of
halls
mentholyptus
not
to
shabby
for
style
palate
is
fine
for
style
and
the
carbonation
works
alcohol
is
hidden
which
is
a
tremendous
plus
for
this
style
overall
not
to
bad
for
the
style
i
am
not
about
to
try
this
beer
i
have
a
story
to
tell
and
it
is
quite
interesting
a
man
in
a
nearby
town
killed
a
woman
and
admitted
to
drinking
natty
daddy
beer
after
the
killing
i
work
in
a
convience
store
every
time
i
wait
on
a
customer
that
is
what
i
think
of
that
man
and
the
graphic
detail
of
how
he
killed
that
lady
i
didnt
know
her
one
of
my
customers
came
in
the
store
on
a
monday
or
tuesday
and
was
buying
that
beer
i
told
him
of
the
man
that
killed
that
lady
and
my
customer
said
it
wasnt
the
beer
that
killed
her
i
told
him
he
is
correct
but
when
you
are
sober
you
arent
as
big
as
you
are
when
you
are
drunk
wednesday
came
and
went
thursday
came
he
got
into
an
argument
with
his
wife
and
it
could
have
been
physical
though
the
police
are
saying
there
werent
signs
of
physical
altercations
on
her
body
she
was
hit
by
a
car
and
killed
two
woman
are
dead
from
men
drinking
this
beer
ironic
that
is
what
i
would
like
to
know
which
brought
me
to
this
site
stillbuff
and
i
quote
says
on
here
7212
totally
tasted
the
booze
and
thoughts
of
doing
bad
sht
immediately
came
through
my
head
which
told
me
that
this
was
a
good
malt
liquor
thoughts
of
doing
bad
sht
immediately
came
through
my
head
hmmm
another
quote
from
thekevlarkid
12912
nothing
to
speak
of
and
clearly
just
a
beer
thats
trying
to
get
people
ripped
so
theyll
be
half
conscious
when
they
mug
someone
in
a
row
house
and
smoke
their
chiba
one
the
street
before
being
hit
by
a
car
because
that
is
how
it
is
done
here
in
balitmore
awesome
before
being
hit
by
a
car
yep
that
is
how
it
is
done
where
i
am
too
because
now
there
are
five
children
without
a
beautiful
mother
death
is
something
serious
that
doesnt
happen
every
day
and
for
two
men
to
be
involved
in
deaths
with
women
after
drinking
this
beer
is
it
ironic
or
is
it
the
beer
i
am
not
going
to
try
it
o
overall
pretty
good
for
what
it
is
but
only
a
decent
beer
in
general
would
do
well
at
a
party
this
was
the
last
one
of
these
at
the
small
grocery
store
that
i
work
at
and
it
had
been
sitting
for
a
few
months
so
its
probably
a
bit
stale
but
whatever
overall
this
is
a
sweet
one
dimensional
beer
that
will
get
you
drunk
play
your
beer
pong
with
caution
dudes
next
time
ill
pay
a
few
cents
more
just
get
a
couple
of
coronas
or
heinekins
overall
not
terrible
for
a
malt
liquor
if
i
had
to
drink
ghettostyle
this
would
be
my
choice
not
great
but
not
terrible
and
still
tastes
sort
of
like
a
beer
after
reading
a
few
of
the
other
reviews
i
really
wish
id
been
at
county
line
beach
and
drank
this
as
stillbuff
did
rofl
on
the
thoughts
of
doing
bad
sht
its
worth
a
try
once
its
way
better
than
natural
ice
that
being
said
its
slightly
above
average
lol
best
malt
liquor
on
the
market
had
a
real
suck
taste
being
a
man
of
no
money
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
malt
liquors
and
i
still
enjoyed
this
totally
tasted
the
booze
and
thoughts
of
doing
bad
sht
immediately
came
through
my
head
which
told
me
that
this
was
a
good
malt
liquor
sent
some
real
stupid
texts
to
chicks
after
this
beer
drink
this
if
its
on
sale
o
i
am
really
not
hating
this
like
i
expected
to
its
certainly
not
very
good
but
it
only
serves
one
purpose
getting
drunk
on
the
cheap
and
in
that
regard
it
fulfills
exactly
what
it
sets
out
to
do
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
inexpensively
like
i
did
just
dont
expect
much
o
for
all
intents
and
purposes
this
reminds
me
of
an
ice
beer
o
not
very
flavorful
even
in
comparison
to
other
beers
in
the
style
goes
down
ok
and
not
too
filling
since
there
isnt
a
lot
to
the
beer
good
kick
decent
representation
of
style
as
the
name
implies
this
beer
is
basically
natty
ice
with
more
alcohol
o
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
ive
had
not
bad
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
the
nicest
component
of
the
beer
it
really
is
not
the
best
malt
out
there
and
with
it
being
more
expensive
then
something
like
a
steel
reserve
and
being
at
least
in
my
mind
of
lesser
quality
i
am
not
sure
why
someone
would
choose
this
brew
if
looking
for
something
low
cost
and
high
potency
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
thats
actually
very
much
ignored
rightfully
so
this
is
not
a
good
beer
the
pour
is
a
clear
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
a
lot
of
corn
corn
syrup
and
sugar
maybe
some
fruity
esters
and
cerealgrain
sweetness
to
it
just
really
quite
sweet
some
pear
and
apple
esters
along
with
lots
of
grain
and
sugary
sweetness
definitely
heavy
on
the
corn
another
fine
malt
beverage
d
actually
pretty
decent
i
suspect
this
is
just
natty
light
before
they
cut
it
with
water
other
than
the
finish
you
could
actually
drink
this
with
some
nachos
expensive
for
the
style
at
1
69
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
will
easily
quench
a
thirst
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
but
theres
nothing
particularly
good
either
it
almost
perfectly
average
but
the
lack
of
a
decent
head
and
lack
of
carbonation
leave
it
below
average
as
a
side
note
my
natty
daddy
was
6
abv
other
reviews
showed
an
8
abv
out
of
a
can
this
beer
was
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
one
finger
of
fluffy
white
head
the
retention
was
not
bad
and
it
left
streaks
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
of
corn
sweet
malt
cheap
booze
and
an
artificial
sweetness
akin
to
candy
the
flavors
were
similar
being
pretty
much
the
standard
grainy
booze
and
sweet
malt
trying
to
hide
the
grainy
booze
nothing
to
speak
of
and
clearly
just
a
beer
thats
trying
to
get
people
ripped
so
theyll
be
half
conscious
when
they
mug
someone
in
a
row
house
and
smoke
their
chiba
one
the
street
before
being
hit
by
a
car
because
thats
how
its
done
here
in
baltimore
awesome
the
mouthfeel
was
average
the
body
mediumlight
and
the
carbonation
high
o
come
on
ab
really
natural
natty
ice
is
competitive
in
its
class
this
well
isnt
id
choose
hurricane
high
gravity
all
day
over
natty
daddy
i
applaud
you
for
trying
but
you
can
do
better
you
can
sorta
taste
the
alcohol
on
this
one
and
is
definitely
a
party
get
buzzed
fast
sorta
beer
with
that
being
said
though
its
a
lot
better
and
has
a
lot
better
of
crisp
fuller
mouthfeel
than
the
regular
nattys
and
budweiser
beers
the
high
alcohol
at
a
cheap
price
without
an
offensive
taste
but
more
of
a
craft
beer
sorta
fruitiness
taste
makes
this
an
average
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
having
again
presentation
packaged
in
a
twentyfour
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
this
is
a
tool
as
much
as
it
is
a
simple
beer
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
you
know
when
you
buy
a
cheap
single
in
a
gas
station
what
you
are
getting
into
usually
from
the
24
fl
oz
can
stamped
293nb80
sampled
on
december
17
2011
another
american
malt
liquor
to
pound
down
from
the
brown
bag
and
it
pours
yellow
with
lots
of
fizz
that
fizzles
fast
it
is
important
to
review
this
based
on
style
rather
than
on
who
brews
it
when
i
first
break
open
the
can
i
get
an
almost
pearlike
fruitness
but
after
i
pour
it
into
the
my
retro
miller
pint
glass
it
becomes
a
typical
grainy
aroma
with
a
sniff
of
yeast
bread
and
clean
crisp
hops
sliding
in
from
the
backside
the
texture
is
in
the
medium
range
and
when
swirling
it
on
my
tongue
it
turns
to
carbonated
bubbles
in
about
ten
seconds
the
taste
is
very
much
in
tune
with
the
malt
liquor
style
with
its
pungent
grainy
and
clean
hop
bite
but
it
does
not
leave
a
sour
aftertaste
like
so
many
other
malt
liquors
for
a
craft
beer
it
gets
a
low
rating
but
strictly
by
style
it
is
a
tad
better
than
others
in
this
category
a
final
observation
in
that
it
was
in
a
rexam
can
that
may
not
mean
much
to
the
casual
cansumer
but
it
was
my
understanding
that
inbevab
had
its
own
canning
division
separate
from
ball
crown
or
rexam
things
that
make
you
go
hmmm
rjt
overall
drinkability
slightly
above
par
for
those
of
you
who
know
nothing
of
golf
that
means
slightly
less
than
average
drink
it
as
cold
as
possible
and
with
food
if
you
must
high
alcohol
natty
saw
this
one
last
week
at
my
local
light
night
store
and
deceided
to
try
it
why
not
it
pours
normal
clear
and
golden
but
the
smell
is
really
clean
i
was
surprised
by
the
taste
being
so
clean
as
well
i
would
not
buy
again
unless
i
turn
homeless
but
overall
not
too
bad
for
a
bmc
product
in
tall
boy
format
i
must
say
my
expectations
werent
exactly
that
high
for
this
but
i
was
really
surprised
if
it
gets
a
little
easier
to
find
around
here
i
would
gladly
pick
this
up
again
plus
at
2
69
for
two
of
these
the
bangforthealcoholbuck
is
unbeatable
this
is
simply
a
higher
alcohol
more
bodied
version
of
natty
light
not
much
to
it
appears
a
darker
yellow
than
normal
ab
beers
smells
of
a
little
alcohol
and
maybe
some
corn
and
cereal
tastes
like
a
more
full
bodied
natty
light
no
hops
or
malts
mostly
has
some
good
flavors
to
it
cant
really
describe
it
not
much
mouth
feel
very
carbonated
great
for
the
price
but
as
a
beer
to
just
drink
nothing
special
at
all
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
malts
and
grains
taste
is
of
green
apples
some
malts
maybe
a
touch
of
plastic
some
alcohol
is
present
but
not
overpowering
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
nothing
great
i
have
certainly
had
high
gravity
lagers
far
worse
than
this
thats
it
i
have
no
more
to
say
other
than
tick
it
if
you
must
but
thats
all
its
good
for
yuck
final
note
great
swill
that
last
few
gulps
of
warm
malt
liquor
that
can
have
a
devastating
effect
on
your
opinion
of
the
cheap
beer
youve
been
swiggin
in
this
case
not
a
big
problem
even
after
it
warms
up
its
perfectly
tolerable
but
like
all
malt
liquors
its
much
better
cold
24
ounce
can
served
up
in
a
pint
glass
this
is
horrible
looking
smelling
and
tasting
beer
but
theres
the
freshman
year
college
student
living
in
me
that
has
to
try
this
beer
wtf
its
fizzy
yellow
and
high
in
alcohol
no
head
retention
or
lacing
this
beer
looks
like
carbonated
cider
or
apple
juice
aroma
has
a
solvent
chemical
smell
to
it
that
really
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
believe
me
this
isnt
the
beer
im
going
to
reach
for
ever
again
flavor
wise
its
hard
to
believe
they
make
something
this
horrible
who
pitched
this
to
the
marketing
team
alright
the
insanely
popular
natty
light
has
to
be
bigger
lets
call
it
nattydaddy
hard
to
swallow
down
pretty
smooth
considering
the
alcohol
content
as
far
as
any
type
of
a
burn
harsh
in
the
flavor
cooked
corn
veggies
a
hint
of
metallic
disgust
and
more
chemical
solvent
no
classic
natural
ingredients
come
to
mind
other
than
damn
this
came
from
a
lab
and
a
factory
setting
mouthfeel
is
horrible
the
flavor
wont
leave
the
palate
this
is
getting
dumped
down
the
drain
that
pretty
much
explains
how
i
feel
about
24
ounce
malt
liquor
this
beer
by
its
very
name
is
marketed
to
people
who
need
to
get
drunk
quick
ever
heard
the
term
fratty
light
this
is
the
same
thing
on
steroids
and
how
can
the
can
have
ale
and
lager
on
the
label
at
the
same
time
that
is
why
i
do
know
really
know
what
style
this
is
malt
liquor
i
guess
just
say
no
to
this
creation
great
with
ice
and
salt
on
the
rim
this
one
is
hard
to
rate
because
its
more
of
a
cocktail
than
a
beer
but
since
this
site
is
about
beer
here
it
goes
pours
a
cloudy
yellowish
white
color
with
absolutely
no
head
smells
just
like
a
margarita
which
smells
awesome
but
as
a
beer
no
tastes
like
lime
and
salt
and
a
little
bitter
going
down
like
i
said
this
ones
tough
because
i
do
like
this
beer
a
lot
but
it
just
doesnt
fit
any
of
the
qualities
of
a
beer
a
sugary
sticky
stomach
ache
in
a
can
kill
it
kill
it
with
fire
it
is
much
more
better
than
the
reviews
on
this
site
give
it
credit
for
smells
like
piss
after
eating
asparagus
has
very
low
abv
and
tastes
like
vomit
overall
1

this
is
like
someone
mixed
king
cobra
with
lime
soda
and
sugar
yeah
that
concoction
would
be
a
hit
at
parties
and
probably
get
you
a
status
but
in
a
can
from
a
large
scale
brewery
what
an
utter
fail
not
bad
if
you
like
lime
but
dont
expect
anything
resembling
beer
or
ale
so
after
all
that
would
i
recommend
it
i
will
say
no
its
drinkable
but
doesn
t
taste
beer
at
all
margarita
in
a
can
or
an
updated
version
of
zima
not
sure
which
overall
this
almost
could
not
be
formulated
to
appeal
to
me
less
overall
terrible
avoid
at
all
costs
best
out
of
the
bunch
although
i
still
wasnt
a
fan
at
least
with
the
original
there
are
some
salt
and
real
margarita
flavors
instead
of
just
a
sugar
overload
the
appearance
was
greenish
yellow
with
a
smell
of
lime
the
taste
was
sugary
but
more
authentic
than
the
other
blankaritas
the
mouthfeel
was
also
better
than
expected
and
not
too
overly
thick
the
beer
hides
its
alcohol
no
grain
flavors
but
it
is
way
too
sweet
straight
from
the
can
aroma
is
margarita
all
the
way
and
so
is
the
flavor
they
nail
what
they
are
going
for
but
i
do
not
get
the
feeling
i
am
drinking
a
beer
and
it
fails
at
that
would
rather
have
a
real
margarita
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
lots
and
lots
of
lime
bring
on
some
burritos
refried
beans
and
rice
and
ill
have
a
feast
o
i
could
probably
do
it
once
a
year
with
a
shot
of
tequila
but
i
will
stick
with
shitty
mexican
beer
for
cinco
de
mayo
and
of
course
shots
of
tequila
if
i
could
score
this
lower
than
1
00
i
would
this
has
got
to
be
the
worst
tasting
stuff
i
think
ive
drank
in
a
long
time
i
think
i
could
get
better
results
pissing
in
a
cup
after
drinking
the
best
double
ipa
im
not
a
big
fan
of
commercial
beers
i
know
its
certainly
not
a
beer
still
unsure
if
it
should
be
labeled
a
malt
liquor
id
rather
drink
a
cup
of
horse
piss
before
i
bought
this
again
thank
the
devil
that
i
bought
2
from
balmart
for
1
each
dammit
i
couldve
used
the
dollar
bills
in
the
strip
club
this
would
appear
to
be
an
attempt
to
emulate
a
margarita
in
the
form
of
a
malt
beverage
and
it
did
accomplish
that
in
appearance
the
nose
was
sour
and
full
of
artificial
lime
the
taste
is
actually
offensive
with
an
awful
sour
lime
juice
flavor
a
lemon
sour
and
a
true
cry
for
tequila
its
very
carbonated
and
i
have
no
idea
whether
its
refreshing
because
i
poured
it
out
pours
a
lemonade
in
color
with
no
head
as
well
as
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
close
to
a
normal
margarita
the
taste
is
close
to
the
aroma
but
nothing
too
exciting
if
i
wanted
a
margarita
why
not
just
have
a
j
c
premix
one
instead
or
make
your
own
as
i
do
which
is
pretty
damn
good
overall
not
real
thrilled
with
this
one
though
i
like
their
razzarita
one
oif
you
like
beer
well
this
is
not
what
you
want
if
you
like
margaritas
this
would
be
great
of
course
you
could
be
like
me
and
like
both
but
not
on
this
site
the
mouthfeel
seems
like
theyre
still
going
more
for
beer
its
not
still
and
smooth
its
definitely
carbonated
and
crisp
its
light
and
thin
as
expected
but
whatever
which
summarizes
my
overall
experience
the
alcohol
is
overpowering
not
to
say
the
limes
not
their
because
it
is
just
not
enough
the
smell
is
also
very
strong
and
for
the
price
you
can
buy
a
4loco
or
jose
which
has
as
much
alcohol
and
it
tastes
better
it
is
hard
for
me
to
recommend
this
drink
i
am
not
sure
it
is
worth
a
try
this
is
not
a
beer
it
does
taste
good
but
not
in
a
beer
kind
of
way
it
is
more
like
a
weak
margarita
which
is
what
they
wer
going
for
i
guess
but
i
would
not
buy
this
for
myself
or
any
beer
lover
had
a
can
given
to
me
so
i
had
to
rate
it
very
sweet
no
bitterness
no
spice
no
beer
flavor
i
decided
to
try
this
just
now
too
and
aside
from
the
nice
8
abv
the
taste
is
actually
quite
nice
im
not
sure
what
changed
my
mind
the
alcohol
is
still
a
bit
overpowering
but
the
lime
seems
to
mellow
it
out
more
than
i
thought
its
also
still
a
little
hard
to
get
down
though
but
definitely
different
than
when
i
wrote
this
review
earlier
another
craptacular
offering
from
a
brewery
reeling
from
the
publics
read
less
than
10
percent
rebuttal
of
their
bland
homogenous
products
say
now
lets
just
blend
their
vacation
swilling
into
an
existing
beer
marketing
with
any
sort
of
power
sucks
balls
once
again
not
a
real
beer
margarita
possibly
f
can
poured
a
lemonade
color
looking
drink
with
ton
of
fake
lime
taste
is
not
that
far
off
margueritas
and
not
even
close
to
beer
i
can
see
this
drink
working
for
a
certain
crowd
but
i
am
not
really
sure
it
has
very
much
to
do
with
beer
at
the
end
of
the
day
o
the
alcohol
flavors
are
well
hidden
by
the
sweetness
so
this
beer
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
especially
for
a
malt
liquor
the
lime
flavors
really
dominate
any
flavor
that
you
would
get
from
the
underlying
bud
light
but
that
is
not
too
surprising
as
the
flavors
are
almost
not
present
in
the
beer
this
was
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
seriously
the
worst
out
of
what
is
probably
getting
close
to
almost
5000
different
beers
first
off
there
are
some
people
on
here
that
are
entirely
too
snobby
this
tastes
like
what
it
is
intended
to
be
its
very
light
limey
and
refreshing
like
instant
margarita
in
a
can
more
carbonated
than
i
was
expecting
but
it
worked
i
hate
bud
light
as
much
as
the
next
person
but
i
wont
knock
this
just
based
on
the
fact
that
it
was
made
by
ab
if
this
had
been
made
by
fff
people
might
very
well
be
raving
about
it
does
it
taste
like
beer
no
does
it
taste
good
and
is
it
extremely
refreshing
absolutely
sourcing
purchased
at
heb
in
texas
in
may
of
2013
for
2
59
for
a
twentyfour
ounce
can
this
is
an
8
ounce
can
bud
light
lime
limearita
8
abv
its
poured
into
a
st
feuillien
glass
and
the
beer
gods
arent
happy
with
me
at
all
hazy
yellow
it
looks
like
somebody
has
a
nasty
urinary
tract
infection
fizzy
white
head
lasts
all
of
two
seconds
aroma
smells
like
frozen
margarita
mix
that
comes
in
those
tubs
a
hint
of
lime
with
a
bottom
shelf
tequila
drinks
like
a
carbonated
margarita
im
getting
a
hint
of
saltiness
with
the
lime
and
margarita
mix
flavor
beer
is
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
flavor
profile
if
you
served
this
blindly
to
somebody
on
cinco
de
mayo
they
would
just
recognize
it
as
a
shitty
margarita
okay
im
no
margarita
connoisseur
but
im
guessing
this
is
what
a
shitty
margarita
tastes
like
after
my
first
sip
im
not
turned
off
so
lets
go
for
number
two
okay
strong
lime
peel
action
with
a
candy
like
sweetness
that
fades
into
a
balanced
mix
of
margarita
mix
with
well
hidden
alcohol
and
a
hint
of
salt
it
is
what
it
is
im
not
hating
i
had
to
try
it
especially
at
the
dollar
price
tag
so
lets
say
this
was
a
fresh
homemade
margarita
with
seltzer
water
the
carbonation
is
what
throws
me
of
why
is
this
margarita
carbonated
they
are
usually
on
the
rocks
or
frozen
in
one
of
those
adult
slurpee
machines
right
it
sets
out
what
its
meant
to
do
get
females
drunk
dont
buy
these
in
number
okay
buy
them
in
number
and
have
a
party
and
let
the
idiots
drink
outside
where
they
will
be
puking
salty
acidic
margarita
mix
thats
carbonated
all
over
your
outdoor
beer
pong
table
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
margarita
mix
residual
sugars
galore
no
depth
except
for
a
fruity
lime
rind
bitterness
with
a
salt
coating
its
actually
not
the
worst
ab
experience
ive
had
that
would
be
by
far
the
chelada
experiment
thats
still
being
sold
on
the
black
market
overall
i
want
to
hate
it
but
the
demon
on
my
left
shoulder
is
whispering
in
my
ear
its
not
that
bad
cmon
you
pansy
just
finish
the
last
2
ounces
you
already
took
three
gulps
whats
one
more
o
the
lime
flavors
completely
obscure
the
taste
of
the
underlying
beer
but
when
you
consider
that
this
is
bud
light
this
might
not
necessarily
be
considered
a
bad
thing
it
seems
a
little
heavy
on
the
limes
and
sugary
flavors
so
this
would
probably
be
best
served
over
ice
so
it
is
diluted
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
perceptible
so
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
malt
liquor
if
someone
is
looking
for
a
quick
buzz
it
also
cost
just
1
so
i
got
my
dollars
worth
out
of
it
overall
it
is
pretty
good
for
what
it
was
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
would
order
it
again
this
is
overall
my
least
favorite
beer
similar
to
the
problems
with
the
strawberrita
this
drink
does
not
have
many
of
the
flavoring
of
beer
overpowered
by
the
lime
flavor
these
drinks
do
not
sit
well
in
the
stomach
because
of
all
of
the
sugar
would
be
better
if
had
more
beer
involved
because
actual
beerritas
are
delicious
overall
its
not
really
much
of
a
beer
since
it
tastes
more
like
lime
juice
would
infuse
it
with
tequila
if
i
ever
had
again
which
is
unlikely
when
we
tried
the
bud
light
limearita
in
class
i
was
very
fond
of
it
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
your
typical
beer
the
coloring
is
a
yellowclear
ish
the
taste
definitely
had
a
twist
to
it
and
tasted
of
lime
and
a
pinch
of
lemon
as
well
i
feel
like
this
would
be
a
very
good
drink
for
tropical
weather
or
by
the
beach
i
enjoyed
it
this
is
a
drain
pour
on
sight
even
if
someone
offers
you
one
for
free
not
only
should
you
refuse
you
should
place
that
person
on
your
enemies
list
i
wish
i
could
give
this
zeros
instead
of
ones
never
again
never
again
might
be
good
on
a
hot
day
out
by
the
water
so
what
to
say
about
it
and
how
to
review
it
you
cant
really
look
at
it
as
a
beer
because
theres
too
much
flavoring
added
to
it
its
entirely
something
else
altogether
so
lets
just
follow
that
route
and
think
of
it
hedonistically
its
sweet
its
a
little
tart
its
even
a
little
salty
overall
its
an
impressive
copy
of
a
margarita
and
theres
certainly
a
use
for
that
the
first
time
i
tasted
this
i
was
in
louisiana
and
headed
out
into
the
hot
sun
to
do
a
little
crawfishin
thats
actually
just
pulling
traps
out
of
a
manmade
pond
dumping
them
rebaiting
them
and
then
replacing
them
it
came
in
handy
and
i
enjoyed
it
it
has
its

its
not

good

or
a
very
good

its
not

it

this
is
pretty

to
what
they
wanted
margarita
flavored
beer
unfortunately
i
can
see
the
niche
for
something
like
this
cant
make
it

to
the

for

dont

to
keep

go
to
your

pick

this

tart
citrus
hangover
city
in
a
can
my
friends
not
sure
how
to
review
this
tastes
like
a
strawberry
soda
its
alright
better
than
the
other
ritas
it
didnt
taste
that
bad
didnt
taste
anything
like
beer
looks
great
too
much
strawberry
taste
but
still
very
drinkable
and
pretty
much
everyone
will
drink
it
not
good
not
good
not
good
honestly
this
is
the
worst
tasting
alcoholic
beverage
of
all
time
they
should
make
alcoholics
drink
this
in
aa
it
will
literally
make
you
hate
alcohol
love
the
ritas
but
low
rating
reason
is
cause
of
them
the
strawberry
is
the
most
off
tasting
its
very
bitter
very
i
like
to
mix
it
with
the
mango
one
good
drink
tho
overall
could
maybe
be
appealing
to
some
i
would
recommend
just
buying
some
vodka
and
mixing
your
own
would
make
me
sick
after
only
a
couple
bobby
bought
this
as
a
joke
for
his
dad
while
we
were
at
cheaha
state
park
all
four
of
us
tried
it
and
all
four
of
us
hated
it
im
not
sure
how
they
can
call
this
a
beer
not
unlike
the
bud
light
lime
limearita
this
is
not
really
a
beer
but
a
malternative
version
of
a
margarita
cocktail
this
version
however
is
of
a
strawberry
margarita
its
bright
and
sweet
and
very
strawberylike
in
flavor
almost
too
much
so
given
the
choice
id
stick
with
the
limearita
overall
3
05
the
raspberry
one
had
a
little
better
flavor
and
more
character
but
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
drink
if
someone
offered
it
to
me
it
is
very
tasty
easy
to
drink
will
get
you
drunk
in
two
or
less
and
has
almost
no
objectionable
or
offensive
flavors
its
simply
an
alcoholic
strawberry
daiquiri
soda
pop
yep
overall
not
a
good
beer
a
decent
alcopop
overall
this
isnt
to
bad
dont
think
this
is
a
fruit
beer
its
not
it
tastes
like
a
daiquiri
i
would
drink
this
again
if
offered
to
me
for
a
treat
during
the
winter
microwave
it
and
drink
it
like
a
mug
of
hot
apple
cider
pours
a
bright
red
with
a
lot
of
sugar
on
the
nose
this
wasnt
my
kind
of
drink
so
maybe
im
biased
but
i
did
not
care
for
the
taste
overly
sweet
with
very
little
in
the
way
of
any
real
flavors
you
get
a
punch
of
artificial
strawberry
and
then
its
just
pure
sugar
no
salt
or
lime
i
could
detect
to
make
it
like
a
margarita
8
oz
can
poured
into
a
mini
shaker
glass
this
the
bud
light
lime
strawberrita
shows
a
strawberry
esque
color
with
a
half
second
of
head
retention
a
firm
pop
belies
the
light
carbonation
aroma
of
sweet
fruit
yet
not
obviously
artificial
in
nature
taste
is
juicy
and
slightly
tart
on
the
finish
sweet
enough
to
mask
the
abv
which
i
guess
is
the
point
behind
it
all
warming
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
wine
cooler
flavor
which
i
guess
is
what
it
is
as
wine
coolers
dont
seem
to
have
wine
in
them
any
longer
anyway
goes
down
easily
and
would
confuse
grandma
and
the
grandkids
as
well
if
you
kept
that
8
thing
to
yourself
not
that
i
would
recommend
such
things
i
drank
a
bunch
of
these
and
puked
all
over
my
wifes
curtains
it
was
awesome
i
could
see
drinking
these
all
day
while
riding
the
cta
and
passing
out
with
my
pants
down
and
pissing
myself
25
oz
cans
and
8
abv
this
is
the
best
thing
since
4
lokos
the
caramel
color
was
added
in
perfectly
how
they
get
that
color
from
caramel
is
beyond
me
i
read
the
can
the
other
day
it
recommended
i
try
it
over
ice
boom
amazing
ahhh
strawberita
i
love
it
it
comes
in
great
big
cans
tiny
cans
that
says
homerun
to
me
i
dont
see
those
imported
mexican
cervesarias
letting
it
all
hang
out
there
by
putting
ritas
in
a
can
the
taste
is
great
no
need
for
salt
on
the
rim
this
isnt
some
gimmick
like
another
100
ibu
ipa
this
is
the
real
deal
goes
down
great
easy
to
shotgun
on
a
moving
bus
makes
you
feel
funny
whats
not
to
love
i
could
see
enjoying
these
watching
the
world
cup
or
riding
on
a
party
bus
to
a
kick
ass
beer
bar
or
barbecuing
with
your
friends
its
a
rita
in
a
can
pow
i
dont
really
understand
all
the
negative
reviews
this
beverage
receives
i
actually
found
it
quite
enjoyable
great
finish
i
could
drink
these
all
day
and
i
plan
to
sure
its
not
up
there
with
some
of
the
popular
craft
beers
like
blue
moon
and
leinenkugels
but
i
think
it
is
a
great
summer
beer
would
not
seek
out
would
not
buy
and
would
not
drink
again
taste
strawberry
juice
sugar
sweet
to
the
extreme
oh
and
yes
a
bit
of
lime
in
the
mix
i
always
try
to
find
the
positives
in
every
beer
i
drink
hmm
cant
think
of
many
i
guess
i
will
have
to
give
it
kudos
for
its
body
texture
and
the
8
abv
is
well
masked
it
reminds
me
of
the
old
wine
coolers
that
were
so
popular
in
the
80s
i
cant
hate
this
outright
sure
its
nothing
like
a
beer
so
the
end
score
reflects
that
but
the
actual
taste
is
ok
once
that
initial
hump
is
passed
by
not
beer
ok
but
for
a
general
fruit
admirer
this
is
ok
which
i
know
is
getting
way
offtopic
but
im
only
keeping
in
tune
with
the
brewers
intent
here
as
it
were
o
any
malt
beverage
that
recommends
you
pour
it
over
ice
is
an
abomination
this
is
not
beer
but
its
ok
to
drink
tasted
like
alcoholic
strawberry
soda
if
that
makes
sense
it
has
enough
alcohol
for
a
nice
little
kick
i
would
drink
think
this
around
the
pool
or
something
if
someone
had
it
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
i
would
most
certainly
drink
this
over
natty
ice
bud
light
corona
etc
straight
godawful
dont
do
it
exception
its
good
to
know
what
the
kids
are
drinking
these
days
it
smells
like
fruit
snacks
the
taste
is
sour
like
sour
carbonated
fruit
punch
cloying
sweetness
and
weird
sour
taste
a
bit
of
fruit
sweet
and
sour
and
finishes
like
nothing
has
a
small
residual
heat
light
watery
body
overall
this
is
a
puzzling
concoction
but
does
taste
like
a
bad
margarita
this
is
not
a
beer
it
does
taste
good
but
not
in
a
beer
kind
of
way
it
is
more
like
a
weak
margarita
which
is
what
they
wer
going
for
i
guess
but
i
would
not
buy
this
for
myself
or
any
beer
lover
had
a
can
given
to
me
so
i
had
to
rate
it
very
sweet
no
bitterness
no
spice
no
beer
flavor
o
this
tastes
like
red
pop
with
a
hint
of
lime
there
is
no
discernible
alcohol
i
got
this
for
the
gf
to
go
with
the
mexican
meal
i
was
preparing
and
figured
id
try
it
it
is
very
sweet
f
for
those
of
us
who
dont
feel
like
cleaning
up
the
mess
after
the
fact
and
have
a
craving
for
a
strawberry
margarita
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
pretty
good
its
no
beer
i
know
i
live
in
asheville
i
know
what
good
beer
tastes
like
but
its
a
nice
alternative
great
for
an
afternoon
at
the
pool
it
even
tastes
like
summer
cheers
overall
for
a
low
calorie
alcopop
this
will
find
a
following
i
just
will
not
be
counted
among
them
nothing
much
to
say
other
than
this
tasted
just
like
a
carbonated
strawberry
margarita
with
some
bitterness
towards
the
end
nothing
special
but
no
offensive
off
flavors
sharp
carbonation
for
what
it
is
its
not
bad
not
sure
why
some
reviewers
are
so
hostile
to
it
oh
well
cheers
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
pink
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
has
some
strawberries
not
much
else
taste
is
of
strawberries
limes
some
sweetness
not
bad
but
i
wouldnt
want
a
steady
diet
of
it
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
not
a
bad
beer
i
would
probably
classify
this
as
a
fruit
beer
instead
of
a
malt
liquor
no
bmc
hate
from
me
my
wife
wanted
to
try
these
so
i
bought
a
12
pack
i
heard
these
are
good
over
ice
so
i
poured
an
8oz
can
into
a
plastic
cup
with
ice
by
my
pool
pours
a
coolaid
red
with
a
tiny
foam
head
from
my
aggressive
pour
that
goes
away
in
seconds
smells
just
like
it
should
heavy
strawberry
with
a
slight
alcohol
scent
8
abv
is
masked
so
good
on
this
tastes
just
like
a
strawberry
margarita
with
little
to
no
alcohol
i
personally
dont
think
its
that
bad
for
what
it
is
if
you
like
margaritas
on
the
rocks
these
are
pretty
good
craft
snobs
will
hate
and
give
their
1s
cause
its
made
by
a
bmc
i
on
the
other
hand
dont
care
who
makes
it
and
am
only
rating
it
for
what
it
says
it
is
how
anyone
can
give
this
above
a
1
is
beyond
me
the
wife
wanted
to
try
it
so
we
figured
2
50
no
huge
loss
if
it
sucks
i
had
one
sip
she
had
one
sip
the
drain
got
the
rest
im
not
trying
just
to
hate
on
bud
i
honesty
like
bud
light
w
lime
but
this
was
horrible
i
guess
you
could
say
it
had
a
taste
of
cough
syrup
and
malt
liquor
if
thats
your
thing
then
you
may
like
it
me
not
so
much
sorry
i
expect
better
than
this
even
from
bud
if
i
had
to
answer
plain
yes
or
no
to
whether
i
like
this
drink
i
would
say
yes
in
my
opinion
if
youre
going
to
buy
one
get
the
strawberrita
version
its
not
a
perfect
drink
but
it
definitely
doesnt
deserve
to
get
a
review
of
poor
light
in
body
there
is
a
base
of
malt
but
there
is
a
ton
of
artificial
strawberry
flavor
lightly
carbonated
this
was
not
good
way
to
sweet
no
balance
i
felt
like
i
was
drinking
a
wine
cooler

o
this
is
not
beer
bud
light
lime
is
the
sprite
of
beer
and
im
ok
with
that
this
however
is
8
oz
of
sugary
artificially
flavored
abomination
thanks
to
my
buddy
the
dude
who
suffered
through
a
24
oz
and
warned
me
of
how
bad
this
is
by
the
grace
of
his
advice
i
only
have
to
gulp
down
2
more
oz
of
ab
tongue
rape
maybe
i
will
violate
my
rule
and
feed
this
one
to
the
septic
tank
sourcing
purchased
at
heb
in
texas
in
may
of
2013
for
2
59
for
a
twentyfour
ounce
can
light
with
a
crisp
soda
like
carbonation
finish
i
wont
be
getting
this
again
not
very
beerlike
but
still
somewhat
tasty
and
refreshing
o
unfortunately
i
did
not
find
the
alcohol
to
be
well
enough
hidden
in
this
beer
for
me
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
it
had
been
served
even
colder
it
was
just
refrigerated
as
i
did
not
have
any
crushed
ice
to
pour
it
over
much
too
sweet
to
be
easy
to
drink
but
it
might
be
something
that
a
person
who
does
not
enjoy
beer
might
like
because
the
flavors
are
covered
8
ounce
can
for
the
masses
to
buy
at
a
dollar
a
piece
what
else
can
you
say
we
might
as
well
start
reviewing
four
loko
because
the
watermelon
is
so
much
easier
to
pound
than
the
grape
flavor
pours
a
slightly
haze
cherry
lollipop
red
this
is
candy
folks
no
head
just
red
nose
is
like
strawberry
reserves
jam
mixed
with
cheap
alcohol
about
to
be
poured
into
an
adult
frozen
margarita
machine
that
they
have
for
11
bucks
a
piece
at
those
outdoor
summer
concerts
kids
all
im
catching
from
this
beverage
is
diabetes
i
dont
care
if
its
8
abv
its
putting
my
liver
into
shock
should
the
liver
metabolize
the
alcohol
or
the
high
fructose
corn
syrup
drink
this
i
guarantee
you
will
be
fat
and
so
will
your
liver
flavor
overkill
jolly
rancher
strawberry
with
a
backend
of
salt
and
lime
juice
get
me
out
of
this
nightmare
the
traditional
limearita
was
acceptable
this
is
however
the
most
disgusting
and
devilish
nectar
of
the
whores
ever
produced
unpalatable
and
yes
i
like
both
varieties
of
strawberries
vine
ripened
and
artificially
flavored
theres
no
beer
going
on
here
its
just
blurred
vision
in
a
can
see
the
light
hell
turn
on
the
red
light
if
you
have
to
and
avoid
this
beer
like
a
case
of
gonorrhea
o
a
horrid
excuse
of
a
beer
plain
and
simple
however
its
an
okay
malternative
that
will
quickly
get
you
drunk
go
into
it
with
those
expectations
and
you
may
not
hate
it
personally
i
wont
touch
this
stuff
ever
again
o
the
strawberry
candy
flavors
completely
obscure
the
taste
of
the
underlying
beer
but
when
you
consider
that
this
is
bud
light
this
might
not
necessarily
be
considered
a
bad
thing
it
is
a
lot
more
drinkable
compared
to
the
limearita
because
it
isnt
as
sugary
and
sourtart
from
the
limes
and
doesnt
require
dilution
with
ice
cubes
no
traces
of
alcohol
are
perceptible
so
this
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
malt
liquor
if
someone
is
looking
for
a
quick
buzz
overall
not
really
a
beer
so
much
as
a
beer
based
strawberry
margarita
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
bud
light
lime
strawberrita
35
overall
i
liked
it
but
i
prefer
the
regular
limaarita
because
it
has
less
of
an
artificial
flavor
taste
this
was
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
like
the
limerita
this
beer
does
not
taste
enough
like
beer
to
me
there
are
lots
of
flavors
of
fruit
and
margarita
in
this
beer
and
most
people
enjoy
it
during
the
hot
days
of
summer
some
times
the
taste
gets
too
sweet
and
you
must
switch
it
up
with
a
beer
will
be
shocked
if
expecting
a
beer
very
fun
version
of
beer
fruity
great
stereotypical
girl
drink
very
little
beer
flavor
so
if
beer
taste
is
what
you
are
looking
for
than
this
is
not
the
drink
for
you
definitely
drink
chilled
over
ice
very
sweet
with
great
balance
of
taste
good
to
start
if
switching
to
beer
the
percentage
of
alcohol
may
be
overwhleming
if
it
is
not
expected
the
crack
and
glug
were
pretty
standard
and
the
result
was
pink
i
had
a
brief
fizzy
finger
of
soda
poplike
head
that
quickly
fizzed
itself
out
of
existence
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
bright
pink
and
i
was
reminded
of
the
chelada
disaster
nose
was
both
tart
and
sweet
with
the
lime
overshadowing
the
strawberry
mouthfeel
was
thin
watery
and
fizzy
more
like
pop
than
beer
the
taste
was
odd
like
the
lime
was
vying
for
supremacy
and
not
quite
succeeding
other
than
to
bring
a
tartness
into
the
equation
otherwise
it
would
have
been
cloyingly
sweet
and
that
is
no
bueno
either
finish
was
puckeringly
tartso
it
seems
like
lime
got
the
upper
hand
at
the
end
poor
strawberry
i
cannot
understand
why
this
type
of
beer
is
being
made
it
just
is
not
terribly
appealing
although
this
was
comparatively
less
awful
than
some
call
it
damning
with
faint
praise
i
had
a
bottle
of
love
is
evol
by
evolution
bc
and
that
is
an
example
of
how
this
should
be
done
now
how
could
i
resist
hm
this
stuff
pours
a
mostly
clear
rose
with
no
real
head
to
truly
speak
of
the
nose
comprises
boozy
and
artificial
strawberry
not
unlike
the
kind
you
might
find
swirling
about
in
a
frozen
daiquiri
with
a
similar
though
smaller
bit
of
lime
riding
shotgun
cant
say
im
all
that
surprised
really
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
reinforcing
my
earlier
image
of
a
strawberry
daiquiri
festooned
with
a
few
chunks
of
lime
there
isnt
that
tiny
trace
of
salt
the
original
limearita
had
which
for
whatever
reason
is
kinda
disappointing
regardless
the
artificiality
of
the
proceedings
puts
me
off
even
though
the
general
flavors
arent
necessarily
all
that
bad
the
body
straddles
the
border
between
hefty
light
and
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
nothing
abhorrent
but
something
awash
in
artificiality
and
mediocrity
still
i
could
easily
see
many
enjoying
these
things
poolside
lakeside
or
even
riverside
strangely
this
isnt
that
bad
if
you
approach
it
like
a
strawberry
margarita
and
youre
in
the
mood
for
one
this
probably
does
the
trick
this
certainly
wont
hold
sway
with
any
hardcore
beer
drinker
and
its
probably
anathema
to
snobs
and
beer
zealots
but
for
those
with
an
open
mind
this
isnt
so
bad
i
would
drink
this
stuff
it
is
8
gives
somewhat
of
a
buzz
but
the
sugary
crap
makes
u
wanna
chow
down
so
needless
to
say
would
probably
stick
to
some
brew
or
something
o
overall
it
was
alright
it
achieved
what
it
set
out
to
do
o
this
beer
starts
out
a
little
harsh
once
the
8
numbs
my
tongue
it
becomes
rather
easy
to
drink
it
is
an
exemplary
example
of
an
underappreciated
style
a
little
too
sweet
good
price
for
the
quality
anything
is
better
than
bud
or
coors
right
the
aroma
isnt
bad
the
name
is
catchy
and
reminiscent
of
upstate
new
york
i
usually
drink
lager
or
ale
warm
but
this
was
ice
cold
no
way
can
i
drink
more
than
4
oz
just
a
bit
too
flavorful
and
i
might
gain
weight
italians
make
their
beer
and
wines
too
sweet
a
golden
color
similar
to
miller
it
doesnt
look
bad
with
a
one
finger
head
but
man
does
it
smell
awful
it
smells
like
a
bottle
return
and
it
tastes
like
old
morning
after
party
kind
of
beer
i
dont
like
it
im
struggling
trying
to
finish
this
glass
so
i
can
review
my
fat
tire
but
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
it
feels
under
carbonated
in
under
10
minutes
and
it
makes
me
gag
spend
the
extra
10
cents
on
something
better
your
best
bet
with
this
is
just
to
shotgun
it
or
have
it
after
youve
had
a
few
the
flavor
is
bad
its
isnt
the
easiest
to
drink
but
its
8
and
its
cheap
but
i
wont
buy
it
for
a
long
time
to
the
brewer
know
your
customers
like
i
said
good
for
what
it
is
outclasses
most
others
on
the
same
shelf
notes
not
much
to
say
overall
its
a
good
value
if
youre
looking
to
get
drunk
and
willing
to
sacrifice
some
flavor
dont
think
ill
be
going
back
for
another
round
though
mouthfeel
i
personally
dont
like
very
carbonated
beers
and
this
one
very
much
that
notes
overall
i
am
not
a
fan
i
saw
this
one
next
to
the
other
regular
lowcost
cheaply
made
beers
near
the
checkout
line
for
a
1
59
i
thought
id
give
it
a
whirl
it
didnt
turn
out
as
bad
as
i
thought
not
great
by
any
means
but
sure
as
hell
beats
the
crap
out
of
something
like
olde
english
800
overall
if
you
like
genny
lager
you
should
give
this
a
try
if
only
for
a
rating
a
hugely
carbonated
light
goldencolored
highgravity
lager
this
can
presents
everything
you
hoped
and
feared
it
would
be
corn
miscellaneous
grain
alcohol
presence
and
some
aluminum
combine
to
make
something
hardly
drinkable
a
tick
is
a
tick
but
this
wont
be
seeing
my
lips
again
even
judging
to
style
this
is
on
the
low
end
of
things
if
you
really
want
to
punish
your
taste
buds
let
it
warm
up
on
a
sunny
day
starts
to
drink
like
its
80
proof
stuff
cheap
but
youd
be
better
to
put
the
money
to
bus
fare
or
something
drain
pour
youve
been
warned
this
is
the
first
time
that
ive
drunk
dog
bite
since
the
alcohol
content
dropped
from
10
to
8
quite
frankly
i
cant
see
why
genesee
would
do
that
the
taste
is
somewhat
different
now
whereas
the
former
and
in
my
opinion
better
version
of
dog
bite
was
very
sweet
tasting
the
new
formula
is
more
runofthemill
as
far
as
an
hg
beer
goes
i
also
dont
get
the
grapeish
smell
of
old
its
still
good
and
well
worth
whatever
small
amount
youll
pay
but
it
isnt
the
axehead
type
of
skullcrusher
it
once
was
r
i
p
to
a
great
beer
and
hello
to
a
decent
one
overall
this
beer
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
lot
worse
than
it
was
genesee
brewing
co
did
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
for
the
style
of
this
beer
smells
like
rotting
honey
and
tastes
like
a
machine
shop
floor
drain
drink
it
ice
cold
and
do
not
let
it
get
warm
it
gets
much
worse
yes
its
10
but
if
you
want
to
get
a
cheap
buzz
on
quickly
without
suffering
i
suggest
you
skip
this
and
stick
to
shots
of
vodka
it
doesnt
get
much
swankier
than
this
every
once
in
awhile
i
just
want
to
get
trashy
for
cheap
and
thats
exactly
what
this
is
designed
for
it
pours
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
sickly
sweet
like
a
bar
bathroom
that
has
been
vomited
in
the
taste
isnt
as
horrible
as
the
smell
and
i
can
get
acclimated
to
it
there
is
a
boozy
aftertaste
but
what
would
you
expect
for
a
10
tall
boy
for
less
than
1
50
fucking
disgusting
horrible
shit
i
never
waste
beer
and
this
got
poured
down
the
drain
there
are
many
more
cheap
strongspecial
brews
that
taste
much
better
avoid
overall
nothing
i
would
do
again
if
you
feel
like
a
malt
which
sometimes
i
do
i
would
not
take
this
one
go
with
something
else
this
was
an
interesting
tasting
experience
this
beer
starts
strongnice
appearance
acceptable
aromaand
then
it
all
falls
apart
this
is
one
of
the
better
of
this
genre
based
on
its
drinkability
and
at
a
buck
fifty
for
a
24oz
can
even
if
it
sucked
it
wouldnt
hurt
my
conscience
too
much
o
eh
whatever
i
guess
its
alright
if
you
only
have
5
dollars
and
want
to
get
smashed
then
this
is
your
beer
other
than
that
stay
away
overall
keep
it
in
the
can
if
you
must
drink
it
all
i
can
really
say
is
that
its
incredibly
cheap
and
will
probably
get
you
fairly
intoxicated
for
less
than
the
cost
of
lunch
other
than
that
its
not
a
particularly
pleasurable
experience
5
to
the
brewers
for
hiding
the
alcohol
overall
it
isnt
good
i
was
able
to
get
down
14
of
a
glass
of
this
stuff
it
is
only
recommended
as
an
exploration
of
bad
beer
taste
is
also
very
sweet
some
apple
and
pear
notes
envelope
glue
isopropryl
sharpness
messy
and
slick
on
the
tongue
astringency
in
this
beer
is
awful
gag
inducing
and
foul
cant
help
but
pull
a
face
when
drinking
it
trying
to
drink
more
that
a
third
of
the
can
is
proving
to
be
a
real
chore
a
novelty
beer
for
the
can
the
beer
inside
is
cheap
swill
not
that
its
advertised
as
anything
but
1
09
can
i
rate
it
as
being
good
in
all
respects
picked
a
bright
orange
can
of
this
garbage
up
while
cruising
back
from
ny
it
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
one
finger
of
white
head
that
left
scant
lacing
the
aroma
was
super
boozy
with
adjuncts
and
pale
malt
behind
that
the
flavors
were
similar
i
started
it
near
ice
cold
and
despite
getting
intoxicated
it
got
worse
as
i
drank
it
and
it
warmed
up
boozy
cheap
and
dangerous
feels
like
a
fistfight
in
a
can
the
body
was
medium
carbonation
high
and
mouthfeel
prickly
1
5
overall
and
im
being
generous
as
generous
i
can
be
considering
that
i
got
suckered
by
the
artsy

by

overall
its
a
high

lager
which
isnt
saying
much
for
the
style
its
average
but
still
not
very
good

to
this
and
it
is
gotten
over
with

nice

smells

tastes
like
an
adjunct
lager
mixed
with
grain
alcohol
and
sterno
overly
boozy

sweet
i
drank
more
of

than
i
could
of
this
three
headed

i
spent
more
time
reviewing
it
than
drinking
it
good
bye
cruel
world
o
not
bad
for
a
high
gravity
lager
but
still
tastes
like
it
could
take
the
paint
off
your
car
o
is
this
24oz
can
worth
the
1
20
i
paid
for
it
im
going
to
have
to
go
with
no
o
not
very
flavorful
does
not
go
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
strong
kick
decent
representation
of
style
i
understand
that
this
is
a
beer
designed
to
pack
a
big
punch
but
even
for
the
style
this
beer
overdoes
it
since
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
anything
at
all
to
balance
out
the
alcohol
note
24
hour
terrible
hangover
the
next
day
is
not
worth
it
i
have
never
had
a
worse
hangover
than
after
this
beer
i
am
a
believer
in
the
mantra
you
have
to
experience
the
bad
to
appreciate
the
good
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
it
stale
grains
soaked
in
watered
down
vodka
with
a
few
sour
apple
jolly
ranchers
thrown
in
for
good
measure
the
taste
is
actually
not
quite
as
bad
as
the
nose
which
is
horrendous
but
half
this
2x4
will
probably
go
down
the
drain
anyway
the
alcohol
is
too
big
for
its
britches
and
the
apple
and
acetone
notes
are
very
distracting
i
will
admit
that
it
is
decently
drinkable
for
a
10
malt
liquor
there
are
worse
variants
out
there
id
still
much
prefer
a
40
of
oe
to
this
if
i
was
fiendin
for
some
malt
licka
overall
drinkability
for
its
style
really
good
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
malt
liquor
more
an
abbey
lager
if
there
was
a
term
for
that
this
review
is
probably
my
biggest
rating
deviation
of
any
review
ive
made
this
being
my
millennial
review
on
beeradvocate
dog
bite
high
gravity
lager
somehow
seems
appropriate
the
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
sweet
candylike
cotton
candy
and
a
bit
of
circus
peanuts
candy
there
is
a
slight
bit
of
green
apple
now
that
is
not
a
great
aroma
but
it
is
actually
better
than
i
expected
the
taste
is
sweet
and
sour
at
the
same
time
reminiscent
of
the
aroma
but
does
not
cause
one
to
gag
seriously
for
a
cheap
10
beer
this
is
about
as
good
as
you
can
hope
its
praise
is
that
it
is
not
nauseating
and
remains
barely
drinkable
doesnt
have
that
look
of
brown
soapy
water
that
most
malt
liquor
seems
to
have
other
than
that
its
unremarkable
in
appearance
smells
extremely
sweet
and
fruity
with
some
tart
graininess
also
also
very
sweet
and
fruity
upon
tasting
tastes
a
little
like
apple
cider
a
hint
of
the
tart
earthy
flavor
associated
with
malt
liquor
is
there
the
slogan
for
this
beer
is
something
about
it
being
a
strong
beer
without
a
strong
bite
and
they
nailed
that
if
im
ever
in
a
situation
where
im
forced
to
drink
malt
liquor
or
just
want
to
get
drunk
really
quick
ill
probably
grab
a
few
cans
of
this
stuff
o
the
nose
was
just
atrocious
but
the
flavor
was
actually
pretty
decent
if
youre
just
looking
for
a
buzz
this
could
work
the
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
so
far
so
good
then
as
soon
as
you
smell
the
beer
you
realize
things
are
taking
a
turn
for
the
worse
i
get
a
lot
of
grain
and
grass
notes
with
a
little
bit
of
orange
mixed
in
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
grain
and
orange
actually
not
bad
for
a
malt
liquor
but
certainly
not
a
good
beer
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
endnote
this
is
a
american
malt
liquor
and
i
judged
it
as
so
per
style
considering
the
competition
and
others
per
style
this
was
fair
to
manage
and
not
as
bad
as
its
overall
rating
may
make
it
appear
overall
i
feel
this
is
worthy
by
style
the
reason
i
reviewed
this
beer
is
to
disagree
with
the
avoid
rating
there
is
no
reason
to
avoid
it
unless
you
are
expecting
more
than
you
should
from
this
beer
come
on
its
genesee
get
real
o
if
i
was
still
in
college
id
go
for
this
but
its
been
about
4
years
r
for
1
49
its
a
cheap
drunk
come
to
think
about
it
nope
still
tastes
like
crap
if
only
the
beer
tasted
as
good
as
the
can
looks
cool
even
after
everything
above
has
been
stated
ive
had
worse
almost
a
finger
of
head
and
no
lace
to
speak
good
things
about
the
color
is
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
smells
like
boiled
corn
and
some
roasted
malt
sweet
malt
taste
is
just
this
side
of
purgatory
flavors
of
boiled
sweet
corn
and
malt
mouthfeel
is
just
this
side
of
water
but
leaves
a
parched
feeling
on
my
tongue
and
the
back
of
my
throat
one
is
more
than
enough
for
me
i
would
give
it
to
a
person
who
thinks
he
knows
about
good
beer
and
watch
his
lip
curl
up
i
have
drank
enough
of
this
style
to
know
an
f
and
this
was
not

overall

i
may
have
a

more
sips
before
throwing
in
the
towel
my
bottle
of
haywards

was
overly
sweet
with
hints
honey
and
bananas
leading
the
way
and
lingering
the
head
was
small
and
white
with
a
foamy
appearance
and
the
body
was
clear

gold
it
felt
syrupy
with
a
small
amount
of
soft
carbonation
i
really
cant
think
of
much
great
to
say
about
this
beer
i
try
not
to
dwell
on
the
negative
however
this
really
is
kind
of
a
sorry
beer
its
just
so
watery
and
bitter
almost
as
if
they
didnt
even
try
its
just
about
a
drain
pour
avoid
at
all
costs
if
your
a
fan
of
true
premium
beer
food
match
what
does
one
eat
with
lagerrum
i
havent
the
foggiest
what
i
imagine
would
go
well
is
jamaican
cuisine
as
that
is
the
only
thing
rum
related
that
comes
to
mind
black
beans
shredded
beef
jerk
chicken
rice
and
plantain
or
stamp
and
go
with
callaloo
fritters
its
lightbodied
fairly
crisp
but
a
little
too
slick
and
not
just
in
the
finish
well
it
looked
like
a
beer
right
this
was
awfully
oxidized
leaving
a
sickly
sweet
aftertaste
its
only
value
was
that
it
quenched
a
little
bit
of
the
power
that
came
from
the
whole
peppercorns
and
cardamom
seeds
i
stumbled
across
as
i
ate
the
biryani
avoid
this
beer
is
boring
but
the
subtle
sweetness
keeps
me
drinking
i
wouldnt
order
this
again
but
would
like
to
see
this
on
tap
if
and
when
we
visit
india
i
also
wonder
where
the
5000
comes
from
maybe
i
will
do
a
little
digging
cheers
people
bought
this
just
to
see
what
this
beer
was
all
about
with
the
goofy
name
weird
that
this
indian
beer
is
basically
and
american
malt
liquor
aroma
is
crisp
malty
and
a
little
fruity
typical
but
at
least
ok
pours
a
clear
rather
wan
yellow
not
too
good
but
at
least
the
white
head
is
thick
and
somewhat
persistent
flavor
is
not
outstanding
but
for
a
pale
lager
a
snip
or
two
above
average
malty
and
fruity
satisfying
texture
has
ok
body
and
ok
fizz
overall
fair
to
middlin
if
not
great
at
least
potable
good
for
a
party
or
with
a
meal
startin
the
day
off
right
with
an
indian
malt
likkah
cause
why
the
fuck
not
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
white
foam
that
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
nose
comprises
bushels
of
corn
atop
a
small
pile
of
wheat
and
grass
its
not
bad
but
certainly
nothing
i
can
call
good
the
taste
is
of
perfumey
rubber
walk
down
the
tire
aisle
some
day
diseased
corn
and
lead
wow
i
did
not
expect
such
a
foul
taste
especially
given
my
sick
predilection
toward
most
malts
damn
this
is
some
intensely
godawful
shit
right
here
it
physically
hurts
during
and
well
after
the
stuff
rampages
across
my
tongue
damn
the
body
is
a
lithe
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
feel
overall
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
ive
had
in
a
long
time
i
dont
think
i
can
properly
put
into
words
just
how
this
makes
my
tastebuds
want
to
flee
the
country
for
fear
that
their
families
lives
are
at
risk
ouch
i
took
another
drink
for
some
masochistic
reason
this
is
an
average
beer
but
different
enough
barely
from
most
macros
to
try
its
a
session
beer
and
nobody
is
going
to
love
it
but
its
alright
its
the
best
malt
liquor
beer
ive
ever
had
the
flavor
is
a
marked
improvement
i
can
even
detect
a
mild
hop
bite
light
grain
the
body
is
decent
with
a
slightly
elevated
carbonation
level
for
the
style
id
say
this
is
better
than
the
typical
suspects
but
it
is
still
suspect
itself
poured
from
a
brown
22
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
corn
taste
is
not
very
good
something
metallic
and
medicinal
is
present
a
bit
of
malt
and
grain
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
subpar
beer
most
american
made
malt
liquors
are
better
served
in
bottle
at
india
house
appearance
is
gold
and
clear
with
minimal
head
smell
feature
sweet
malts
dry
bread
mild
corn
and
other
grainy
qualities
taste
matches
nose
with
sweetness
up
front
dry
grains
and
light
hop
bitterness
come
though
as
well
pretty
decent
flavors
for
a
malt
liquor
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
overall
nothing
offensive
here
which
i
fully
expect
with
the
style
so
in
that
realm
this
is
pretty
good
otherwise
pretty
standard
lager
overall
its
the
typical
profile
for
a
malt
liquor
but
a
bit
fleeting
in
the
malt
department
one
is
more
than
enough
way
to
sweet
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
very
strong
of
course
it
is
5000
and
the
stronger
version
but
it
was
very
bitter
the
aftertaste
is
strong
the
colour
is
like
any
lager
but
a
little
darker
yellow
compared
to
other
indian
beers
very
strong
and
can
get
you
very
very
drunk
have
only
one
and
share
with
friends
you
wont
know
what
hit
you
works
as
a
lawnmower
beer
or
with
spicy
food
not
that
bad
oh
dear
im
in
a
fix
only
one
more
chilled
beer
and
theres
this
poured
cold
from
the
fridge
with
a
small
to
medium
foamy
frothy
offwhite
head
that
quickly
settled
to
an
island
and
ring
with
no
lace
color
is
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
lots
of
large
and
small
bubble
trails
aroma
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
sweet
with
a
little
beery
malt
hop
flavor
isnt
so
good
mainly
neutral
sweet
carbonic
tang
hint
of
bitter
body
is
there
but
not
pleasant
and
carbonation
is
too
strong
and
clashes
heck
everything
clashes
in
this
brew
finish
is
like
flavor
and
of
medium
length
which
is
way
too
long
bleh
this
is
what
a
lager
should
smell
and
taste
like
buy
it
youll
like
it
shipped
all
this
way
and
3
a
bomber
there
is
your
answer
it
does
the
job
if
you
can
stomach
over
a
year
old
malt
liquor
from
far
away
all
in
all
id
actually
go
for
budweiser
before
this
unless
i
was
enjoying
a
curry
for
that
matter
id
opt
for
a
molsons
xxx
if
i
wanted
something
strong
with
lots
of
body
but
not
overwhelming
in
alcohol
o
average
quality
more
or
less
in
a
high
abv
macrolager
overall
a
simple
basic
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
much
other
than
baird
i
often
dont
hold
out
much
hope
for
asian
beers
would
i
buy
a
bottle
maybe
not
i
got
this
from
a
rep
as
a
sample
i
can
see
it
being
a
good
move
from
the
bcm
market
but
other
than
that
meh
overall
reminds
me
of
a
regular
bmc
product
and
this
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
overall
unpleasant
and
coarse
but
not
entirely
undrinkable
its
like
an
indiaborn
malt
liquor
o
not
good
it
was
worth
a
try
since
indian
beer
is
not
widely
available
where
im
from
but
i
doubt
ill
have
this
again
unless
im
at
an
indian
restaurant
and
i
plan
on
getting
wasted
or
in
india
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
gold
with
a
half
an
inch
of
white
fluffy
head
and
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
strong
toasted
oat
and
corn
smells
from
the
beer
and
not
much
else
slightly
sour
grain
taste
to
the
beer
with
a
quick
and
dry
finish
minimal
pale
aftertaste
but
tolerable
standard
lager
but
great
with
spicy
food
dudes
anyone
trying
this
beer
must
have
done
a
tour
of
duty
in
india
i
had
my
experience
in
lucknow
what
a
place
anyone
who
has
been
to
india
know
what
i
am
talking
the
beer
is
typical
of
a
macro
brewed
beer
clear
goldenyellow
in
color
not
alot
of
head
smell
is
iffy
and
so
is
the
taste
the
alcohol
makes
it
tough
to
do
a
session
with
it
and
overpowers
the
taste
however
when
you
are
in
lucknow
any
beer
will
do
and
if
i
was
in
lucknow
right
now
drinkin
the
haywards
5000
i
would
be
smiling
d
not
a
terrible
beer
hides
the
alcohol
well
the
metallic
flavor
really
goofed
this
one
up
d
this
is
what
my
indian
friends
tell
me
that
they
got
smashed
off
of
in
college
it
was
kind
of
their
equivalent
to
a
40
oz
bottle
i
wasnt
surprised
that
this
didnt
come
in
one
it
is
not
good
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
of
head
that
left
good
blotchy
lacing
on
the
glass
the
grains
and
sweet
malt
dominate
the
aroma
that
also
had
slight
wheat
and
spice
notes
pretty
simple
nose
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
nose
with
the
grains
and
malts
playing
the
main
role
which
also
had
caramel
and
slight
ctiric
accent
the
brew
was
medium
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
that
had
a
slight
sweet
and
malty
finish
overall
its
an
average
lager
that
goes
great
paired
with
shrimp
tandoori
which
also
drank
very
well
and
was
really
refreshing
i
wouldnt
drink
this
one
again
unless
served
very
cold
and
for
a
great
price
at
a
restaurant
factor
in
freshness
also
if
it
was
new
i
would
try
it
again
this
one
sat
in
my
fridge
for
a
month
or
so
and
the
regions
of
where
it
came
were
shady
theres
my
disclaimer
d
this
was
an
ok
macro
style
lager
that
paired
well
with
spicy
indian
food
if
i
was
having
this
by
itself
i
would
have
struggled
to
finish
it
actually
by
the
time
i
was
done
eating
i
still
had
about
5
ounces
in
my
glass
and
i
found
myself
not
too
interested
in
finishing
it
appearance
is
a
cloudy
straw
golden
color
with
a
quickly
dissapating
head
smell
is
lightly
sweet
that
has
a
malty
graininess
to
it
taste
has
a
maltyadjunct
light
sweetness
leaving
a
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
light
having
good
body
with
crisp
carbonation
actually
not
bad
for
a
fairly
high
alc
adjunct
beer
which
is
fine
until
it
gets
to
the
bitter
end
it
is
the
sort
of
beer
to
have
over
a
business
discussion
on
a
warm
afternoon
does
it
taste
like
a
kristal
weizen
no
it
tastes
metallic
too
with
a
very
slick
mouthfeel
pretty
unoffensive
but
then
again
its
also
really
bland
aroma
is
mild
sweet
and
malty
flavor
is
crisp
clean
and
mildly
malty
nothing
special
but
not
really
bad
either
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
are
both
light
easy
to
drink
with
spicy
food
the
drinkability
was
nothing
special
overall
most
folks
would
rather
drink
a
beer
thats
aromatic
and
full
bodied
same
with
the
mouthfeel
nothing
special
even
with
an
aggressive
pour
not
much
of
a
head
mainly
comprised
of
larger
quick
to
pop
bubbles
no
foam
white
in
color
minimal
lacing
left
behind
raw
grainy
nose
like
unshucked
corn
metal
iron
notes
without
mineral
water
foundation
to
fall
back
on
some
fuller
bread
notes
sour
grapefruit
rind
has
a
saline
quality
as
well
nothing
about
it
that
jumps
out
as
fruit
overall
the
smells
dont
piss
you
off
it
just
smells
like
generic
beer
mediumbodied
broadshouldered
carbonation
which
lasts
easily
through
the
finish
pretzels
sourdough
rye
more
cooked
than
raw
if
indistinguishable
as
elements
certainly
makes
it
evident
that
this
is
a
straight
down
the
middle
of
the
plate
lager
beer
sour
mixed
white
citrus
more
iron
flecks
an
uptick
in
apricot
to
peach
fruit
pits
and
skins
maybe
fig
due
to
the
carbonation
doesnt
lose
weightpalate
presence
through
the
finish
old
coriander
powder
without
faulting
it
or
its
place
of
origin
too
much
it
falls
exactly
into
line
with
expectations
youre
in
a
cheap
indian
restaurant
scarfing
down
some
vindaloo
chicken
and
nan
and
this
is
the
beer
you
drink
there
no
mystery
no
failure
to
meet
a
certain
threshold
of
quality
great
no
contextually
viable
absolutely
i
have
stopped
drinking
this
beer
post
my
tryst
with
belgians
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
54
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
adjunct
pale
malt
and
yeast
fits
the
style
of
an
american
adjunct
lager
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
adjunct
metallic
yeast
pale
malt
and
slight
hops
overall
a
not
so
great
beer
but
to
be
expected
this
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
but
the
head
or
lack
thereof
leaves
something
to
be
desired
the
aroma
is
high
metallic
copper
and
sweet
bread
light
on
the
palate
and
in
the
flavor
department
the
brew
tries
to
come
across
clean
but
is
thwarted
by
unpleasantness
lurking
the
background
veggies
with
a
twist
of
skunk
perhaps
overall
not
recommended
but
if
it
is
the
only
thing
on
the
beer
list
at
favorite
indian
joint
it
may
do
palate
is
surprisingly
fruity
but
the
first
taste
is
that
nasty
pride
of
ringwood
character
again
which
appears
on
the
front
luckily
this
goes
away
by
the
mid
palate
leaving
a
nice
apple
character
but
one
that
is
quite
watery
and
insipid
finish
is
actually
quite
sweet
but
not
very
nice
overall
the
palate
isnt
actually
badly
constructed
frankly
it
just
doesnt
taste
good
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
but
also
has
a
slight
sticky
note
to
it
its
not
a
pleasant
beer
although
one
thing
for
it
is
it
does
go
well
with
the
spicy
food
dif
one
was
to
drink
only
indian
beer
while
in
india
you
can
do
a
lot
better
than
this
i
know
everyone
seems
to
hate
on
kingfisher
but
i
would
make
kingfisher
my
session
for
a
week
than
touch
this
again
i
felt
dirty
after
drinking
it
aroma
of
stale
bread
butterscotch
and
alcohol
not
pleasant
bad
aftertaste
thin
yet
coating
a
bit
better
than
the
aforementioned
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
d
just
plain
horrible
flavors
a
horrible
lager
bite
and
just
bad
brewing
techniques
but
then
again
what
else
would
you
expect
from
sab
undrinkable
couldnt
finish
d
3
5
overall
one
of
my
favorite
indian
beers
so
far
the
flavor
profile
on
this
is
very
interesting
and
different
then
most
else
on
the
market
after
sitting
for
awhile
and
warming
to
room
temp
there
was
an
out
of
place
banana
taste
that
was
neither
here
nor
there
kingfisher
paired
much
better
with
the
spicy
lamb
curry
strangely
bright
tanyellow
color
with
a
thin
cap
of
head
and
a
sharp
sourness
in
the
nose
that
is
mostly
malt
taste
is
strong
sour
malt
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
finish
is
fairly
clean
but
not
good
at
all
the
alcohol
is
an
intimidating
enforcer
behind
the
sour
assault
wow
this
is
pretty
bad
if
you
want
a
brew
to
drink
with
indian
food
go
with
kingfisher
or
cobra
this
is
barely
drinkable
at
all
nothing
special
it
might
work
well
with
some
cuisine
but
i
think
other
beers
of
the
same
genre
probably
surpass
it
the
indian
preference
for
super
strong
beers
is
often
a
menace
somehow
the
kick
is
considered
more
important
than
the
taste
the
wellknown
beer
knockout
spells
it
out
quite
clearly
haywards
5000
would
most
likely
taste
better
with
less
alcohol
still
its
a
kind
of
indian
equivalent
to
eurolager
perhaps
hindulager
and
its
definately
functional
it
smells
sweet
and
the
hal
finger
of
foam
disappears
quickly
the
taste
is
maltybready
with
a
distinct
alcohol
breath
lingering
in
the
mouth
i
often
wonder
over
indian
beer
names
haywards
is
obviously
meant
to
give
the
beer
a
heritage
feel
the
number
5000
may
just
be
a
high
number
indiacting
the
potency
of
the
brew
heman
9000
is
another
example
flavor
starts
sweet
with
some
corn
sugar
and
a
hint
of
caramel
again
some
spicy
hops
are
present
and
a
bit
of
husky
malt
and
some
cornvegetable
notes
as
well
on
the
finish
there
is
a
hit
of
citrusyrind
hops
the
beer
is
clean
and
sweetnot
great
or
exciting
but
certainly
not
a
drain
pour
either
drinkable
only
as
a
last
resort
very
last
has
a
very
light
yellow
colored
body
with
a
big
white
head
that
disappears
immeadiately
the
aroma
is
lightly
grainy
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
kind
of
a
sweet
grassy
taste
no
hop
bitterness
evident
mostly
a
strong
alcohol
presence
in
the
flavor
not
much
else
this
remineded
me
of
some
biere
forte
that
i
purchased
in
canada
a
few
years
ago
mostly
alcohol
rush
and
no
real
beer
flavor
sinkability

i
definitely
cant
make
myself
finish
this
thing
pours
with
a
twofinger
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
very
pale
yellow
color
light
carbonation
nose
is
hay
like
in
a
barn
starts
and
finishes
sweet
light
bodied
so
far
my
best
beer
from
india
but
this
is
only
the
fourth
the
label
has
this
manufactured
by
skol
breweries
1
95
for
a
330ml
bottle
this
would
be
the
last
indian
beer
i
tried
on
my
trip
and
it
didnt
help
my
impression
of
the
business
in
that
country
light
golden
color
no
discernable
head
smelled
slightly
skunky
but
thats
about
it
lousy
hoppiness
like
it
was
watered
down
maltiness
was
negligable
rather
flat
but
drinkable
for
the
abv
i
felt
it
after
the
oversized
bottle
but
i
wasnt
ready
to
have
another
one
id
rather
sprite
ok
maybe
one
of
the
better
brews
from
india
but
not
great
a
clear
gold
body
is
capped
by
a
short
head
of
bright
white
foam
the
retention
is
fair
and
although
it
drops
a
bit
it
still
maintains
a
thin
creamy
layer
across
the
surface
some
minor
lace
also
adds
to
the
appearance
the
nose
displays
some
higher
alcohols
and
acetaldehdye
its
not
quite
offputting
but
its
certainly
not
pleasant
either
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
smooth
due
to
the
combination
of
its
mediumfull
body
and
finebubbled
moderate
carbonation
the
alcohol
found
in
the
nose
reappears
in
the
flavor
amidsts
a
somewhat
grainy
and
sweetish
malt
thats
backed
by
a
firm
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
with
residual
lingering
alchohol
not
a
very
wellmade
beer
by
any
means
it
has
a
negligable
head
and
a
pale
golden
color
its
not
particularly
carbonated
and
has
a
sweet
alcolol
smell
the
taste
is
initially
malty
and
well
balanced
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
soft
pleasant
mouthfeel
at
times
grainy
very
slight
warming
but
the
alcohol
herecould
be
dangerous
again
it
doesnt
rank
up
with
the
greatest
beers
but
selfdescribed
malt
liquors
rarely
do
shoutout
to
three
floyds
region
riot
this
is
imminently
drinkable
however
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
naty
ice
or
say
steel
reserve
strong
as
per
local
standards
o
my
first
malt
liqour
and
maybe
i
will
not
be
chasing
one
again
just
not
very
drinkable
all
in
all
it
is
what
it
is
thin
and
watery
as
well
as
fizzy
in
the
feel
this
lightbodied
beer
is
sweet
in
the
feel
but
goes
extremely
dry
into
the
finish
still
its
surprisingly
clean
and
when
the
fizziness
fades
somewhat
crisp
before
it
falls
off
i
also
hope
this
is
the
correct
beer
mine
was
in
a
1
liter
bottle
and
came
from
the
philippines
it
was
labeled
as
extra
strong
beer
and
was
8
so
im
assuming
it
is
right
anyway
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
a
nice
straw
colored
brew
with
a
nice
big
white
head
however
that
did
not
last
very
long
lacing
was
decent
the
beer
smelled
kinda
yeasty
but
good
the
taste
was
good
very
fresh
very
unshocking
pretty
normal
seemed
to
be
highly
carbonated
and
did
not
taste
strong
like
the
8
would
have
made
me
think
it
would
be
no
burn
great
taste
i
would
buy
again
the
official
beer
of
filipino
galivanting
and
camaraderie
the
8
abv
makes
red
horse
an
excellent
choice
for
those
seeking
a
cheap
buzz
the
1
in
6
crazy
horse
bottle
is
stuff
of
legend
actually
not
terrible
tastes
like
a
bunch
of
cereal
grains
processed
industrially
metallic
aftertaste
and
bone
dry
going
down
quite
filling
but
a
good
time
pours
a
clean
and
clear
golden
straw
color
quite
bubbly
but
no
retention
when
cold
scent
was
muted
cereal
grains
with
a
splash
of
floral
hops
but
as
it
warms
a
slight
but
unpleasent
chemical
rubbery
smell
comes
through
with
industrial
alcohol
taste
starts
clean
when
cold
sweet
cereal
light
flowers
and
faint
fruit
water
but
chemicals
and
alcohol
come
through
increasingly
as
it
warms
bad
lingering
aftertaste
bubbly
and
very
light
less
body
and
flavor
than
most
malt
liqours
but
some
unpleasant
notes
creap
in
o
goes
down
easy
not
overly
tasty
not
filling
decent
kick
ok
representation
of
style
this
is
a
soso
beer
larger
abv
but
not
a
lot
of
body
and
flavoring
to
it
d
wish
the
body
as
well
as
the
nose
had
some
more
grain
in
it
for
a
7abv
brew
im
surprised
at
such
a
light
body
another
boring
rice
brew
from
asia
in
my
book
2
o
just
a
so
so
brew
nothing
special
or
anything
i
would
remember
aroma
is
crisp
and
malty
rather
strong
nothing
to
tweet
about
but
still
promising
it
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
and
not
very
persistent
white
head
about
what
one
expects
from
beer
of
this
type
flavor
is
well
there
is
a
hint
of
malt
but
not
much
to
it
texture
is
smooth
and
fairly
fizzy
but
body
is
below
average
well
the
philippines
are
not
renowned
for
beer
maybe
we
should
send
some
craft
brewers
over
there
or
some
trappist
monks
not
a
beer
id
revisit
by
choice
though
if
youre
stuck
with
a
selection
of
rice
lagers
and
looking
something
with
a
nonoffensive
alcohol
kick
red
horse
isnt
too
bad
d
little
different
fruity
corny
sweet
sharp
crisp
and
watery
nothing
harsh
but
nothing
crazy
great
the
abv
is
there
and
you
can
taste
it
1
will
do
you
is
it
great
no
is
it
bad
no
overall
red
horse
is
harsh
but
it
was
expectedly
harsh
even
among
its
pernicious
brethren
its
pretty
low
on
the
totem
pole
this
beer
has
danger
written
all
over
it
high
alcohol
beer
that
can
easily
be
chugged
without
being
to
heavy
or
sugary
the
taste
is
very
dulled
down
with
no
distinguishable
features
but
for
malt
liquor
that
may
be
a
good
thing
overall
the
beer
is
ok
if
thats
all
you
got
left
in
your
fridge
burping
up
this
beer
is
as
bad
as
it
smells
the
only
reason
id
ever
buy
this
again
is
to
get
another
confirmation
from
a
fellow
beer
drinker
that
this
beer
smells
like
vomit
overall
not
much
to
recommend
from
this
one
this
one
was
kind
of
strange
it
was
nothing
impressive
which
is
obvious
by
my
review
numbers
but
it
was
fairly
drinkable
granted
i
had
just
came
in
from
doing
yard
work
in
the
hot
southern
sun
but
this
was
easy
on
the
tastebuds
and
not
offensive
in
any
way
it
was
fairly
watery
tasting
which
was
hard
to
believe
since
it
was
supposed
to
be
over
7
smell
and
taste
were
much
the
same
water
ok
maybe
a
little
hint
of
adjunct
but
not
much
this
could
easily
replace
bud
light
or
miller
light
and
its
stronger
howd
they
do
that
i
was
impressed
because
most
malt
liquors
i
have
had
a
funky
alcoholy
taste
especially
when
you
start
to
get
over
6
this
one
didnt
d
this
beer
is
not
as
bad
as
the
ratings
would
suggest
its
definitely
not
the
greatest
beer
ive
tasted
but
its
certainly
not
the
worst
it
seems
that
it
would
be
a
refreshing
and
a
quite
strong
beer
for
a
nice
summer
day
really
not
the
best
beer
out
there
not
even
close
to
a
decent
brew
really
this
beer
is
a
plain
yellow
with
a
white
head
that
fades
quickly
its
got
a
sweet
smell
which
is
ok
but
the
taste
it
just
a
mix
of
sweetness
and
metal
not
very
pleasent
at
all
i
cant
believe
that
poeple
brew
this
with
the
intent
to
sell
medium
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
is
low
due
to
the
rather
unpleasant
taste
its
not
the
worst
beer
in
the
world
but
it
is
is
a
contender
i
had
to
ask
if
this
was
actually
made
with
hours
urine
because
it
smells
like
it
it
is
sharp
with
a
bad
taste
just
bitter
and
super
carbonated
at
first
then
went
flat
in
a
few
seconds
thankfully
i
was
eating
food
to
get
the
taste
out
it
was
almost
like
sucking
on
a
penny
other
than
the
novelty
of
trying
a
beer
from
this
country
i
cant
think
of
a
good
reason
to
have
one
of
these
poured
a
gold
tinged
with
amber
aroma
was
slightly
medicinal
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
rough
grain
edge
was
pretty
much
the
extent
of
the
entire
flavor
roster
for
this
beer
not
undrinkable
but
hardly
enjoyable
i
dont
think
i
will
go
into
the
whole
process
on
this
one
it
for
me
pretty
much
taste
like
old
english
800
or
something
similar
adjunct
city
very
light
and
clear
near
white
thin
head
not
great
taste
nor
mouthfeel
very
disappointing
at
the
7
99
price
tag
per
sixer
this
malt
liquor
were
talking
about
dont
expect
some
amazingly
complex
flavor
it
is
what
it
is
edit
as
it
warms
things
get
worse
i
poured
the
last
half
undercarbonated
slick
and
watery
taste
is
not
really
there
not
unpalatable
but
not
that
great
either
i
had
this
beer
quite
a
few
times
while
i
was
back
home
in
philippines
its
a
21
y
o
crowd
fav
since
it
was
cheap
and
got
you
a
good
buzz
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
this
aint
half
bad
but
i
guess
i
mean
that
in
the
literal
sense
like
half
of
zero
is
still
zero
swish
yeah
imbibe
this
only
if
your
taste
buds
humility
and
bank
card
are
all
taking
the
day
off
or
have
for
some
time
my
condolences
overall
if
i
was
served
one
around
here
i
wouldnt
refuse
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
an
alcohol
bite
are
present
atop
a
foundation
of
less
noble
grains
a
brief
grassy
cidery
flavor
is
present
at
the
back
of
the
palate
at
the
finish
alcohol
taste
dominates
throughout
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
very
mild
malt
and
corn
aroma
taste
is
crisp
with
some
malt
and
corn
flavors
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
in
the
philippines
and
was
happy
to
see
it
here
in
the
usa
for
the
first
time
one
of
my
favorite
malt
liquors
d
tastewise
there
is
really
nothing
that
excites
or
appeals
to
me
its
got
basic
cheap
flavors
but
at
7
abv
it
can
get
ya
drunk
easy
enough
after
a
few
if
thats
your
goal
it
actually
started
to
taste
worse
and
worse
the
more
i
had
of
it
well
then
better
than
i
expected
in
some
aspects
even
more
palatable
than
most
domestic
malt
liquors
and
many
domestic
macros
yet
isnt
really
what
im
itching
for
most
days
however
for
those
of
you
in
the
crowd
out
for
a
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
cheap
buzz
this
is
your
stuff
if
mountain
crest
catches
wind
of
this
stuff
itll
sink
their
ship
jonathan
passow
this
was
brought
to
a
party
by
my
friend
who
bless
him
got
it
instead
of
a
wheat
beer
because
they
store
worker
said
it
was
fantastic
i
need
to
ask
him
what
store
it
was
and
slap
that
person
d
nothing
harsh
about
this
beer
very
light
body
and
flavor
nothing
i
would
seek
out
in
the
future
but
it
was
given
to
me
so
i
drank
it
taste
it
doesnt
taste
as
good
as
it
smells
but
its
still
really
good
for
a
malt
liquor
overall
for
a
malt
liquor
this
isnt
too
bad
the
smell
and
aftertaste
knock
this
1
down
a
notch
this
one
is
a
drinking
paradox
no
problem
enjoying
the
500ml
glass
of
it
but
would
i
want
it
another
if
free
ok
i
wont
buy
another
import
bottle
but
would
drink
it
locally
very
quick
bright
white
spongey
head
no
lacing
or
bubbling
bright
yellow
with
maybe
a
dull
brass
sweet
pilsnery
malt
aroma
with
maybe
a
touch
of
herbal
grassy
hops
malty
swet
whn
its
cold
and
maybe
some
herbal
hop
notes
very
simpe
tasting
beer
wasnt
expecting
much
mild
sweetness
on
the
palate
tha
lingers
a
bit
cant
really
notice
the
7
abv
but
i
recommend
finishing
this
bere
before
it
gets
warm
tastes
good
cold
so
you
have
to
drink
a
7
beer
prety
fast
sounds
like
a
recipe
to
drunk
really
fast
you
cant
really
savor
this
beer
in
any
decent
time
span
for
a
malt
licquor
this
one
is
a
good
bet
im
no
expert
on
this
style
but
this
cant
be
a
good
example
surely
pale
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
very
rapid
fading
head
aroma
is
almost
nothing
taste
is
macro
like
but
with
a
sourness
i
cant
quite
identify
this
beer
is
by
no
means
terrible
but
i
cant
imagine
paying
again
for
this
when
there
are
some
many
other
choices
out
there
i
would
drink
again
if
offered
to
me
but
it
is
just
too
boring
of
a
beer
to
seek
out
the
aroma
is
corn
malt
grassy
hops
and
funky
bo
the
appearance
is
pale
gold
with
a
fizzy
head
like
the
kind
on
a
soda
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
with
a
touch
of
medicinal
qualities
the
palate
is
super
thin
i
cant
see
drinking
this
for
any
reason
d
unimpressed
all
around
drinks
quite
easy
for
its
7
0abv
but
still
not
enough
reason
to
do
so
received
as
gift
first
of
all
poured
from
40
cant
remember
the
last
time
i
had
one
of
these
into
pint
glass
clear
light
yellow
with
some
fluffy
head
smell
is
poor

that

no

this

i

and
less
thin

scrubbing
carbonation
and
unpleasant

have
led
me
to
decide
that
this
belongs
in
the
reject
pile
im
sure
the
good
people
of
the
philippines
know
full
well
that
this
is
pure
swill
good
for
the
party
crowd
im
sure
like
a
cider
and
beer
hybrid
gave
it
a
3
its
drinkable
strong
sweet
when
i
think
malt
liquor
i
definitely
think
mickeys
old
english
etc
this
isnt
a
gross
farty
beer
its
a
smooth
malty
lager
so
while
the
categorization
may
be
debated
its
quite
enjoyable
i
will
not
drink
this
beer
unless
there
are
no
other
choices
needs
to
be
served
cold
a
basic
malty
beer
but
it
can
be
refreshing
under
the
right
conditions
average
as
a
whole
but
i
dont
hate
it
the
way
that
some
seem
to
hate
it
tastes
light
a
bit
sweet
touch
of
malt
with
caramel
and
buttery
notes
fizzy
on
back
kind
of
bitter
carbolic
note
without
much
complexity
very
slight
roundness
from
body
but
otherwise
booze
is
not
detectable
which
is
to
its
credit
but
then
its
like
a
strong
beer
without
the
flavourcomplexity
so
whats
the
point
just
dangerous
really
have
a
lighter
beer
if
you
want
something
easy
drinking
drinks
easy
for
the
abv
doesnt
really
taste
like
a
malt
liquor
to
me
too
fruity
smooth
not
bad
im
sure
if
i
drank
enough
a
fierce
hangover
could
be
had
better
than
its
rating
but
having
had
this
in
past
i
would
say
this
beer
probably
goes
down
hill
quickly
if
exposed
to
uv
light
or
to
much
heat
if
given
limited
choices
this
might
work
other
wise
caveat
emptor
on
this
pours
a
clear
goldenorange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
wisps
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
sugar
and
alcohol
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sweet
grain
and
fruit
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
and
an
alcohol
kick
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
that
is
fairly
drinkable
and
not
as
offensive
as
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
had
a
bottle
with
a
skillet
of
sisig
at
maharlika
in
nyc
overall
it
wasnt
offensive
but
it
was
also
pretty
boring
it
tasted
like
a
bland
clean
export
lager
with
none
of
the
vegetal
offflavors
that
usually
come
with
a
malt
liquor
i
guess
thats
good
dont
feel
the
need
to
the
try
this
san
miguel
would
have
been
a
slightly
more
interesting
beer
the
taste
has
a
light
malt
flavor
with
the
sweetness
of
malt
but
smooth
and
gentle
with
a
more
dry
presence
as
the
alcohol
is
there
making
the
beer
seem
thinner
as
a
result
which
is
not
bad
it
is
not
hot
just
strong
with
mild
spice
probably
from
the
elevated
carbonation
giving
that
carbonic
element
overall
i
like
this
for
what
it
is
malt
liquor
it
is
simple
and
does
the
trick
not
great
flavor
but
better
than
many
i
have
tried
and
i
would
drink
this
again
in
the
philippines
as
far
as
bang
for
the
buck
and
flavor
this
is
the
one
as
in
many
countries
the
one
brewery
controls
most
if
not
all
of
the
market
and
as
in
most
of
southern
asia
all
the
available
brews
are
subpar
o
this
beer
doesnt
have
a
very
exciting
taste
but
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
pretty
good
when
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
unfortunately
though
thats
its
main
benefit
it
actually
comes
across
as
a
pretty
bland
if
drinkable
lager
so
the
hidden
booze
is
just
a
trap
or
a
benefit
depending
on
your
preference
overall
not
good

in

plain

not
the

terrible

liquor
out
there
but
still
not
worth
revisiting
o
another
on
of
these
hot
summer
days
brews
in
a
foreign
country
type
its
perfectly
fine
for
a
beach
boat
or
humid
day
it
will
go
down
quick
and
easy
and
its
at
least
got
some
taste
a
malt
liquor
sure
its
got
all
the
trademarks
yet
that
overused
concept
of
drinkability
strangely
applies
here
dunno
why
oh
right
ive
suitably
lowered
my
expectations
a
la
reruns
of
snl
this
beer
is
kind
like
a
subpar
american
light
beer
like
bud
light
boo
these
guys
for
pretty
a
less
than
beer
beer
in
a
cool
looking
bottle
and
using
up
a
decent
name
that
an
irish
red
would
have
been
proud
to
carry
overall
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
but
i
dont
really
like
them
in
general
anyway
bleh
gimme
a
colt
or
oe800
body
is
weak
and
boring
like
most
light
lagers
from
the
region
but
honestly
id
happily
drink
this
as
my
beer
of
choice
if
i
lived
in
the
phillippines
it
was
listed
as
malt
liquor
on
the
bottle
but
i
found
it
to
be
more
like
a
strong
lager
as
its
listed
here
at
a
1
75
this
beer
is
worth
a
shot
if
you
see
it
and
i
might
try
it
again
as
a
walkaround
beer
as
the
weather
warms
up
this
is
honestly
a
decent
nobrainer
beer
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
this
is
a
brew
from
san
miguel
thailand
ltd
pathumthani
thailand
i
am
not
sure
whether
its
also
brewed
in
philippines
or
not
it
is
definitely
different
from
red
horse
liquor
o
tastes
like
any
other
macro
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
attributable
to
the
higher
abv
definitely
not
recommended
and
a
mistake
i
surely
wont
make
again
o
pretty
typical
adjunct
lager
undrinkable
i
did
have
this
a
long
time
ago
and
do
remeber
it
being
kind
of
nasty
but
not
this
bad
im
defrinatly
thinking
these
are
old
bottles
if
i
can
ever
get
some
more
for
some
reason
id
try
to
do
a
re
review
but
im
definatly
not
going
out
of
my
way
to
get
it

i
suppose
it
is
better
than

original

but
obviously
is
not
a
good
product
drinkability
is
not
nearly
as

the
other

liquors
of
the
world
i
probably
could
have
had

didnt
have
anymore

up

with
a
bit
of

in

finish
refreshing
not
bad
for
what
it
is
this
beer
poured
a
coppery
yellow
with
a
thin
singlefinger
head
that
lingered
for
a
little
while
the
smell
is
a
little
subtle
with
some
malt
and
perhaps
some
cereal
the
taste
is
almost
all
malts
with
a
hint
hops
and
a
little
alcohol
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
thicker
than
i
expected
from
a
malt
liquor
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
that
would
likely
grow
progressively
tastier
as
the
night
went
on
not
something
i
would
normally
drink
for
pleasure
but
not
a
bad
choice
if
its
going
to
be
one
of
those
nights
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
when
this
beer
first
hit
my
lips
i
was
very
surprisedthis
beer
is
full
bodiedwell
more
full
bodied
than
i
expected
at
leastin
terms
of
overall
beer
styles
id
say
it
has
more
of
a
mediumlight
body
but
for
the
style
it
is
much
fuller
than
expected
it
finishes
with
a
slightly
drying
finish
carbonation
is
just
right
medium
levels
give
this
beer
a
nice
crisp
clean
and
biting
refreshment
that
one
doesnt
normally
find
in
a
macro
this
is
a
beer
that
id
definitely
drink
again
it
is
the
best
offering
in
the
category
of
a
pale
lager
that
ive
ever
had
from
bmcto
date
if
you
have
a
chance
to
try
this
beer
i
highly
recommend
it
it
will
surprise
you

definitely

special
thanks
goes
out
to

for
the
12
oz
bottle
poured
out
a
clear

color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the

subtle
slight

notes
tiny
bit

the
taste
was
nearly
nonexistent
bit
o
honey
bit
of

the
mouthfeel
was
bright
and
bubbly
and
being
a
close
second
cousin
to
mineral
water
was
amazingly
and
highly
drinkable
born
north
of
the
border
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
takes
me
back
to
more
innocent
days
of
hanging
out
in
windsor
at
the
ballet
this
beer
is
about
the
same
as
all
the
other
lagers
that
molson
puts
out
but
the
alcohol
content
is
a
little
higher
drink
it
cold
once
it
warms
up
its
truly
crap
not
recommended
unless
your
trying
to
get
fd
up
and
dont
want
to
lose
your
seat
at
the
tip
rail
from
going
to
the
head
a
dozen
times
not
a
bad
beer
in
a
pinch
and
being
a
malt
i
used
to
drink
this
stuff
as
an
import
from
quebec
in
the
70s
when
it
had
body
and
was
8
avb
recently
bought
a
couple
of
singles
from
the
beer
store
quite
a
letdown
from
the
way
i
remember
it
poured
like
the
typical
molson
fizz
pale
golden
carbonated
weak
heading
more
malt
sweetness
to
the
nose
than
most
molson
slop
medium
mouth
feel
with
sweet
malt
acceted
by
a
nice
hop
twang
fast
finish
but
a
nice
bready
after
taste
alcohol
is
detectable
not
bad
not
good
certainly
not
the
way
it
was
golden
with
a
slight
head
no
smell
except
a
little
yeast
great
tasting
if
it
remains
icey
cold
if
not
tis
a
wee
bit
skunky
no
apparent
hops
or
any
malt
this
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorite
beers
but
now
im
a
bit
educated
to
tasting
i
realize
this
belongs
in
a
fotee
next
to
schlitz
cobra
or
even
an
mgd
if
you
are
going
to
drink
it
drink
it
fast
that
alone
says
something
about
this
when
my
friends
suggest
this
i
thought
they
were
pulling
my
leg
but
i
guess
there
are
hommies
in
canada
too
this
gutter
beer
has
nothing
on
its
american
counterparts
drick
it
extremely
cold
and
fast
unless
you
wnat
to
hurl
despite
the
fact
that
this
malt
liquor
has
a
rough
alcohol
taste
to
go
along
with
a
taste
of
burnt
corn
i
must
wax
nostalgic
about
it
for
a
moment
many
trips
were
made
over
the
border
to
the
dutyfree
shop
in
windsor
ontario
in
pursuit
of
this
beverage
in
my
youth
and
it
did
fine
by
me
now
back
to
the
present
not
a
good
beer
molson
and
the
rest
of
canada
for
that
matter
make
much
better
i
feel
bad
giving
this
brew
such
a
poor
review
i
can
vaguely
recall
having
some
great
times
with
xxx
when
i
wasyounger
this
was
the
holy
grail
xxx
was
the
ultimate
party
beer
tastes
more
list
aluminum
than
beer
even
from
a
bottle
it
doesnt
taste
too
bad
when
its
ice
cold
and
it
rocks
you
pretty
hard
which
is
the
point
eh
well
its
an
xxx
so
thats
all
you
have
to
say
well
it
could
of
been
much
worse
a
sweet
malt
that
made
me
feel
blah
after
4
sips
the
beer
is
your
archetypal
malt
liquor
with
a
surprisingly
heavy
bottle
boasting
thick
glass
its
a
sweeter
beer
with
high
tones
of
corn
husk
sweetness
and
a
sharp
alcohol
bite
that
gives
you
7
3
abv
with
no
subtly
whatsoever
its
gonna
take
me
a
while
to
get
rid
of
this
twelve
pack
given
i
cannot
session
this
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
special
and
a
sharp
downfall
from
the
greatness
of
molson
canadian
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
medium
white
head
has
fruity
citrus
nose
with
some
grains
and
cereal
corn
flavor
palate
is
a
medium
body
carbonation
is
good
the
finish
is
the
same
as
above
with
some
lingering
sweet
grains
and
alcohol
on
the
end
overall
not
too
bad
an
ok
drinking
brew
for
the
style
its
not
beer
so
much
as
gasoline
and
piss
topped
off
with
soda
water
o
well
not
my
favorite
malt
liquor
bit
of
a
european
approach
to
its
constitution
that
works
to
a
disadvantage
here
it
might
be
alright
if
the
metal
element
was
toned
down
theres
obviously
something
tasty
hiding
below
has
to
get
through
unobstructed
if
youre
acting
as
a
beer
snob
is
sweet
it
smells
like
malt
liquor
and
it
also
has
that
look
the
taste
is
bold

sweet

the
taste
isnt
good
at
all
theres
a
metallic
bitter
taste
which
is

but
does
have
a
good
fruity
overtone
that
keeps
it
from
being
a
total
loss
flavor
is
better
than
i
expected
from
the
weak
aroma
fairly
strong
a
little
darker
yellow
than
i
expected
and
since
its
not
very
crisp
that
really
makes
it
less
than
an
appealing

after
the

the
best
thing
i
can
say
about
this
beer
is
that
if
youre
looking
for
a
buzz
a
syrupy
sweetness
like
karo
syrup
obviously
being
used
to
mask
the
7
3
alc
bitter
hops
in
the
middle
and
more
caramel
malt
sweetness
at
the
end
slightly
metallic
for
being
what
it
is
mass
produced
malt
liquor
this
is
pretty
good
but
its
still
tough
to
down
one
and
the
best
i
can
say
for
it
is
a
for
effort
but
c
for
execution

best
aggro
pour
only
resulted
in
a
fingers
worth
of
head
and
then
alcohol
the
taste
is
mainly
of
booze
with
some
faint
light
malts
and
some
hoppy
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
but
kind
of
harsh
due
to
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
it
the
drinkability
is
not
very
good
just
bland
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
a
sourish
aftertaste
was
the
only
nod
towards
complexity

not
that
good
but
does
have
a
punch
to
it
da
these
brews
are
usually
decent
session
beers
but
just
get
a
bit
boring
in
the
long
run
this
one
at
7
3
is
not
a
session
beer
this
beer
isnt
great
but
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
you
could
be
doing
worse
and
at
least
this
comes
in
12
ounce
servings
instead
of
having
to
choke
down
a
40
it
got
me
pretty
drunk
quick
and
i
didnt
like
how
present
the
alcohol
taste
was
its
a
good
beer
just
to
sit
around
and
get
people
trashed
with
but
i
dont
think
im
ever
going
to
buy
it
again
it
poured
a
dark
yellow
with
a
foamy
whit
head
that
was
gone
quickly
overall
just
like
any
other
malt
liquor
except
maybe
a
little
better
tasting
cheers
feels
funny
to
pour
this
into
a
glass
but
what
the
hell
clear
and
yellow
very
macro
looking
a
foamy
white
head
nose
is
corn
and
metal
like
if
corn
nuts
had
an
aluminum
flavor
instead
of
the
usual
ranch
or
original
taste
is
metallic
and
bland
you
get
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
but
not
that
much
considering
the
relatively
high
abv
drinkability
depends
on
if
youre
already
drunk
andor
tailgating
25
or
so
ounce
can
very
pale
yellow
clear
body
with
about
two
or
three
fingers
of
head
smells
sweet
and
alcoholish
as
is
the
practice
for
me
when
sampling
malt
liquors
i
poured
about
a
half
a
glass
then
drink
the
rest
from
the
can
or
bottle
as
the
brewer
probably
intended
tastes
somewhat
sweet
with
very
apparent
alcohol
presence
typical
malt
liquor
having
said
that
i
think
steel
reserve
is
better
and
im
waiting
to
see
how
my
dogfish
head
liquor
de
malt
in
the
fridge
will
be
but
i
bet
thats
better
too
albeit
about
65
more
expensive
not
too
impressed
but
i
wasnt
really
expecting
to
be
i
suppose
if
you
must
have
a
molson
go
for
the
ice
its
not
much
or
a
beer
but
its
more
pleasant
and
paletable
and
probably
cheeper
to
try
and
perhaps
to
buy
as
well
if
you
want
malt
liquor
give
mickeys
a
try
this
beer
poured
a
brilliant
gold
color
with
an
attractive
pillowy
head
that
left
some
lace
on
the
glass
this
looked
much
better
than
i
expected
the
aroma
was
typical
for
the
style
corn
vegetable
and
some
sweet
malt
mixed
in
taste
was
quite
fruity
with
a
light
malt
flavor
in
the
finish
i
expected
a
big
shot
of
alcoholic
burn
but
never
got
it
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
it
was
actually
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
to
drink
hell
this
is
probably
the
least
inoffensive
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
did
i
get
lucky
or
something
id
take
this
over
bmc
any
day
and
it
was
not
a
bad
deal
for
6
49
a
sixer
i
must
be
losing
my
mind
drinkability
pass
this
6
6pack
tastes
no
better
than
many
40
oz
glass
bottles
2
00
a
pop
what
do
you
get
big
ass
can
of
sweet
crap
pours
piss
pale
yellow
head
hangs
around
for
a
while
smells
sweet
but
not
overpowering
tastes
way
too
sweet
like
fermented
corn
syrup
kinda
sticks
around
for
a
while
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
overall
more
crap
from
a
crap
beer
company
but
if
your
low
on
this
will
work
the
only
thing
i
can
say
good
about
this
beer
is
that
with
the
7
3
at
least
you
dont
have
to
drink
many
to
get
drunk
a
good
tasting
beer
if
you
had
to
condemn
it
it
might
be
described
as
a
little
watery
tasting
it
is
though
a
quick
and
pretty
strong
buzz
it
is
an
above
average
beer
but
im
not
too
sure
about
paying
for
almost
30
00
a
casei
could
just
as
easily
buy
beast
ice
and
get
the
same
effect
for
about
half
the
price
but
when
i
tried
the
beer
poured
into
a
cup
i
was
surprised
the
beer
is
dark
and
complex
i
had
expected
sour
and
dirty
but
i
must
now
praise
the
triple
x
i
cant
say
this
beer
excites
me
enough
to
go
out
and
buy
it
but
if
molson
called
this
molson
premium
if
that
name
hasnt
already
been
taken
i
think
more
people
would
take
this
beer
seriously
poured
from
a
big
fosters
style
oil
can
white
foamy
head
not
bad
the
retention
is
pretty
good
smells
like
cooked
corn
alcohol
and
faint
hop
has
a
mediumlight
body
and
is
highly
carbonated
alcohol
hits
the
tongue
fast
and
is
paired
with
a
sweet
grain
plenty
of
cooked
corn
to
go
around
not
much
more
to
say
about
this
beer
a
beer
for
getting
drunk
very
quick
overall
a
pretty
average
beer
that
packs
a
punch
a
tad
better
than
i
remember
it
from
the
last
time
i
had
it
not
something
i
would
normally
purchase
but
one
of
the
better
molson
products
i
love
american
malt
liquors
but
this
canadian
pornomalt
is
awful
i
bought
a
whole
entire
oil
can
to
drink
and
i
must
say
it
caused
me
great
suffering
molson
xxx
is
superastringent
and
terribly
hard
to
drink
7
3
is
a
good
strong
percentage
for
a
malt
but
not
if
it
tastes
this
bad
worthless
tastes
hot
and
cheap
and
furthermore
the
can
design
is
absolutely
repellent
and
warns
you
against
the
almost
total
lack
of
refreshment
this
beverage
provides
maybe
its
better
in
the
bottle
i
may
never
know
12oz
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
medium
light
gold
with
a
quickly
fading
head
but
decent
lace
a
definate
corn
and
rice
aroma
is
present
but
also
a
sweet
honey
like
smell
as
well
hop
presence
is
faint
again
corn
and
rice
flavors
hit
first
but
also
the
honey
like
flavor
light
hops
alcohol
is
present
but
for
a
7
3
beer
with
flavors
this
light
it
is
hidden
nicely
and
make
it
very
drinkable
growing
up
in
buffalo
we
went
across
the
border
and
always
grabbed
this
stuff
i
havent
seen
it
in
foreveer
so
when
i
saw
it
here
in
nc
i
bought
a
sixer
true
that
there
is
not
a
ton
of
flavor
and
in
my
youth
i
bought
it
just
to
get
drunk
but
its
really
not
all
that
bad
as
a
malt
liquor
is
is
above
average
and
it
does
hide
the
alcohol
nicely
despite
its
lightness
poured
a
clear
bright
urine
colored
golden
yellow
from
a
12oz
bottle
left
a
thin
fizzy
white
head
that
fell
fairly
quickly
to
light
white
lacing
smells
grainy
and
somewhat
sweetly
of
generic
malt
and
alcohol
taste
is
very
much
the
same
slightest
hint
of
hops
present
alcohol
by
volume
at
7
3
in
a
beer
this
simple
is
most
definitely
the
most
dominating
factor
in
taste
and
aroma
showing
this
beers
true
colors
this
beer
was
not
meant
to
be
savored
or
really
even
tasted
but
in
fact
to
intoxicate
however
there
is
nothing
terrible
in
fact
would
call
this
beer
bearable
much
better
than
many
macro
products
expected
better
from
molson
though
but
this
beers
excessive
abv
with
no
other
truly
pleasurable
attributes
makes
it
boring
and
simple
presented
in
a
huge
25
4oz
can
with
xxx
ohsosubtly
situated
in
huge
letters
on
the
middle
of
the
can
cant
say
you
didnt
know
what
you
were
getting
into
with
this
one
pours
a
bright
golden
color
topped
by
a
huge
fizzy
white
head
that
actually
has
decent
retention
and
a
touch
of
lacing
aroma
of
cheap
adjunct
malt
and
not
much
else
palate
is
relatively
inoffensive
adjunct
malt
corn
a
bit
of
rich
sweetness
and
maybe
just
a
whiff
of
hops
body
is
typical
for
a
strong
malt
liquor
full
and
slightly
chewy
goes
down
very
easy
for
such
a
strong
beer
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
it
isnt
terrible
this
beer
has
one
and
only
one
purpose
to
get
you
hammered
and
quickly
its
a
pale
yellow
not
the
really
bright
macro
yellow
almost
a
watered
down
yellow
smell
is
faintly
of
malts
and
mostly
of
alcohol
taste
is
a
bit
sour
a
little
bit
of
grain
a
little
sweet
and
almost
no
hops
alcohol
is
definately
the
dominant
taste
mouthfeel
is
average
i
guess
nothing
stands
out
here
either
drinkability
is
good
too
good
used
to
drinking
much
weaker
beer
i
polished
off
the
whole
sixpack
of
this
when
i
tried
it
big
mistake
i
got
completely
trashed
which
was
funny
at
the
time
because
i
didnt
have
to
be
at
work
in
the
morning
but
not
so
amusing
when
i
woke
up
the
next
day
feeling
like
shit
this
is
smooth
drinkable
and
the
taste
isnt
really
the
least
bit
objectionable
but
it
has
almost
no
character
or
body
its
basically
really
smooth
malt
liqour
made
for
getting
drunk
and
none
too
cheap
either
at
something
like
7
for
a
sixpack
i
guess
a
sixpack
of
this
would
beat
the
hell
out
of
a
12pack
of
natural
ice
or
a
couple
40oz
bottles
of
old
english
im
assuming
the
second
im
not
stupid
or
broke
enough
to
try
that
garbage
like
that
but
it
doesnt
really
have
any
other
redeeming
characteristics
i
have
no
desire
to
drink
anymore
than
this
bottle
the
only
value
to
this
beer
is
if
you
are
looking
to
get
drunk
i
imagine
its
a
big
hit
with
the
college
crowd
body
is
between
light
and
medium
well
carbonated
and
has
a
tacky
sticky
mouthfeel
no
need
to
drink
this
not
even
for
a
buzz
if
you
want
a
tastey
beverage
and
a
healthy
buzz
buy
something
else
but
if
you
want
to
pound
a
sixpack
quickly
and
brake
stuff
by
all
means
pick
this
stuff
up
deep
golden
body
is
almost
shiney
head
is
2
inches
of
thick
bubbley
off
white
foam
nose
has
a
dominent
yeasty
wheat
feel
also
has
a
citrus
rind
feel
and
a
very
common
beer
backround
hits
the
mouth
sharp
fruity
and
almost
candy
like
sweat
very
smooth
with
almost
a
waxy
bitter
hue
finishing
off
the
palate
has
a
slight
resamblance
to
malt
liquer
big
25
4
ounce
can
at
7
3
i
was
expecting
much
worse
but
this
is
actually
not
bad
very
drinkable
pours
out
a
gold
clear
highly
carbonated
brew
with
a
half
finger
head
that
drops
quickly
smells
of
grain
and
grassy
hops
taste
of
a
typical
macro
type
with
a
little
alcohol
warmth
in
the
ending
i
wont
say
its
horrible
its
not
but
wayy
better
macros
are
out
there
if
i
wanted
to
get
fall
on
my
ass
get
into
fights
wasted
and
do
it
cheaply
this
would
be
my
vehicle
but
that
might
be
disrespectful
to
beer
macro
breweries
making
high
gravity
beers
from
their
regular
line
is
always
a
bad
idea
this
beer
pours
an
oily
straw
color
with
moderate
carbonation
head
retention
is
noticable
but
not
impressive
smells
vegetable
sweet
with
corn
sugars
with
some
lightstruck
noble
hops
for
bittering
corn
sugars
and
hops
dominate
upfront
giving
little
to
fruity
characteristics
carbonation
and
higher
alcohols
give
noticable
levels
of
harshness
and
unnecesary
heat
to
the
mouth
finishes
a
bit
harsh
phenolic
and
hot
for
a
lager
aftertaste
is
a
dry
vegetable
sweetness
does
not
have
a
pleasant
lager
flavor
not
is
it
a
pleasant
experience
on
the
mouth
but
the
mackenzie
brothers
would
be
proud
ooh
ya
becha
seems
like
only
yesterday
we
were
sneaking
this
back
in
from
canada
during
our
underage
trips
to
niagara
falls
now
the
mystique
is
gone
after
revisiting
this
college
memory
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
very
little
head
smell
is
pleasant
enough
a
little
malty
taste
is
rather
sweet
on
the
first
sip
mostly
malty
with
almost
no
hoppy
flavor
the
alcohol
is
pretty
obvious
and
its
seems
a
little
overcarbonated
basically
a
good
beer
for
getting
drunk
with
your
buddies
watching
hockey
and
eating
wings
but
not
exactly
a
classic
pours
gold
with
a
one
finger
white
head
mostly
clear
fades
to
moderate
lacing
quickly
smells
of
apple
esters
and
alcohol
medium
to
full
bodied
with
sweet
adjunct
taste
and
flat
carbonation
xxx
is
a
malt
liquor
disguised
as
a
canadian
lager
while
it
masks
high
alcohol
content
with
a
smoother
mouthfeel
and
better
taste
the
finish
is
still
harsh
and
the
taste
is
still
somewhat
cidery
its
just
more
exspensive
its
always
scares
me
when
my
friend
from
canada
shows
up
with
a
case
of
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
that
is
not
very
attractive
smell
is
very
faint
with
a
slight
sweetness
taste
is
also
very
light
for
a
7
3
beer
which
is
the
scary
part
too
easy
to
drink
and
obce
you
drink
too
much
its
too
late
i
try
to
avoid
more
then
one
of
this
beer
on
the
headache
the
next
morning
is
unbelieveable
by
the
way
did
you
know
that
if
you
peel
the
label
off
and
fold
it
like
a
back
page
of
mad
magazine
so
that
the
molson
says
moon
it
makes
a
devils
face
much
better
than
olde
english
800
hg
a
lot
less
alcoholy
with
a
metallic
bitterness
that
comes
from
a
mixture
of
the
aluminum
of
the
25
4
oz
oil
can
alcohol
and
a
very
little
pinch
of
hops
thin
macrolike
mouthfeel
overall
slightly
better
than
the
big
3
decent
beer
for
when
you
want
something
light
simple
for
washing
down
takeout
food
or
after
mowing
the
lawn
or
if
moneys
tight
and
youre
looking
for
a
quick
cheap
buzz
a
half
step
above
your
usual

that
quickly
dissipates

nothing

skunky

i
suppose
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
the
taste
i
have
had
molson
on
tap
in
the
past
its
drinkable
on
tap
barely
bottled
however
was
a
little
lacking
i
suppose
it
would
have
gone
better
with
some
nice
greasy
appetizers
or
something
eh
i
wont
ever
buy
this
one
on
purpose
man
this
stuff
is
harsh
i
really
question
the
production
of
a
beer
such
as
this
pours
out
to
a
medium
dark
yellow
color
with
lower
carbonation
harsh
smell
of
alcohol
is
first
noted
with
little
else
as
its
very
over
powering
initial
flavor
is
of
cooked
corn
and
alcohol
with
a
slightly
chemical
taste
on
the
finish
if
youre
looking
for
a
quick
trip
to
drunkville
this
is
the
ticket
worth
a
try
but
get
this
stuff
as
cold
as
you
can
to
prevent
vomiting

master

a
friend
of
mine
brought
one
of
these
over
for
me
to
try
pours
a
yellowgolden
color
with
a
thin
head
that
disappears
rapidly
none
of
the
usual
molson
skunkiness
in
the
aroma
instead
its
fairly
crisp
and
clean
with
a
bit
of
hoppiness
malt
dominates
the
flavor
profile
while
the
hops
take
a
background
crisp
on
the
palate
but
with
a
fairly
sweet
taste
that
i
didnt
particularly
care
for
i
really
couldnt
drink
more
than
one
of
these
and
see
no
reason
to
ever
purchase
it
myself
more
than
likely
its
intended
for
the
molson
drinker
who
wants
to
cop
a
good
buzz
on
due
to
its
high
alchohol
percentage
the
scent
came
across
with
a
light
hoippiness
and
some
fruit
the
taste
was
fairly
light
with
a
long
finish
color
is
a
darker
straw
and
the
head
is
made
of
large
bubbles
that
go
away
rapidly
smell
is
pretty
much
sweet
malt
and
alcohol
the
taste
is
again
basically
a
bland
sweet
malt
and
strong
alcohol
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
though
and
goes
down
well
if
you
are
looking
to
drink
malt
liquors
this
might
as
well
be
it
shameful
reminds
me
of
the
good
old
college
days
very
high
in
alcohol
i
only
remember
my
first
one
the
rest
was
little
blurrier
than
i
expected
this
is
like
your
typical
molson
beer
but
it
has
some
legs
to
it
first
the
color
of
it
is
a
bit
draker
than
others
in
the
molson
family
of
beers
and
it
doesnt
have
the
skunky
molson
smell
it
goes
down
smooth
but
will
fill
you
up
fast
if
your
not
drunk
by
time
you
are
full
the
high
abv
gives
it
its
legs
althought
it
does
taste
better
ibn
canada
and
has
just
startes
being
sold
in
the

it
is
a
good
stand
by
beer
for
that
night
out
just
dont
drink
too
much
of
itand
think
you
can
drive
home
afterwards
itll
get
ya
drunk
the
beer
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
scent
with
a
dry
lager
yeast
aroma
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
malty
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
little
more
body
than
thier
other
offerings
it
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
dry
and
slightly
sweet
nothing
special
the
mouthfeel
was
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a

it
has

pours
a
delightful
deepgold
and
crystalclear
body
beneath
a
short
head
of
brightwhite
foam
that
receeds
quickly
and
although
its
head
retention
should
be
tempered
a
bit
by
its
7
3
alcohol
it
hold
only
a
very
thin
collar
and
leaves
no
lace
the
nose
delivers
a
surprising
amount
of
graininess
however
which
is
nice
and
some
minor
alcohol
sugarsweet
notes
and
subtle
yeasty
fruitiness
there
are
no
distinguishable
hops
but
it
seems
that
they
might
be
hiding
somewhere
in
the
background
its
crisp
in
the
mouth
and
initially
bristles
on
the
tongue
the
body
is
medium
and
in
combination
with
its
lightly
zesty
carbonation
and
splash
of
alcoholic
heat
it
has
a
somewhat
aggressive
feel
across
the
palate
the
flavor
delivers
a
basic
malt
liquor
character
with
no
notable
defects
the
alcohol
is
slightly
apparent
but
thats
fairly
common
to
the
style
the
maltiness
is
not
quite
as
grainy
as
the
nose
suggests
but
nor
is
it
sweet
as
some
examples
can
be
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
are
also
present
which
is
nice
and
it
finishes
quite
dry
with
a
lingering
slap
of
alcohol
oh
yeah
i
dont
how
the
bottle
is
but
this
crap
from
a
can
really
takes
on
the
metallic
taste
of
the
can
not
really
bad
but
alot
worse
than
many
other
canned
beers
if
you
want
to
get
tanked
quick
and
cheaply
this
stuff
is
a
buck
ninteynine
for
one
of
the
fosters
style
monster
cans
get
two
of
them
and
youre
all
set
you
want
a
quality
brew
go
else
where
this
super
premium
beer
poured
out
an
extremely
clear
golden
color
softly
carbonated
and
topped
with
a
thin
white
head
that
turned
into
a
film
after
the
second
pour
the
aroma
has
a
strong
cornystale
graininess
along
with
a
touch
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
a
bit
harsh
with
corny
malt
liquor
and
funky
malts
the
adjuncts
are
apparent
in
this
beer
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
you
can
call
this
molson
malt
liquor
the
hop
aromabitterness
is
muddled
and
ambiguous
it
seems
like
they
took
their
regular
beer
and
ramped
it
up
with
cheap
adjuncts
to
just
increase
the
alcohol
this
beer
misses
the
mark

it

on
a

of
boring
pouring
budweisers
labatts

i
was
looking
for
something
with
more
substance
and
the
7

abv
suggested
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
chance
while
i
wasnt
entirely
disappointed
with
this
beer
and
i
would
probably
again
choose
it
over
molsons
export
gold
or
ice
it
is
a
large
brewing
company
brewing
a
beer
that
lacks
real
distinction
interest
or
style
it
was
decent
in
the
mouth
decent
going
down
but
if
you
are
looking
at
characteristic
that
you
might
expect
in
a
higher
abv
beer
it
isnt
here
i
rate
the
appearance
as
the
only
thing
straying
from
average
as
it
is
a
deeper
golden
color
and
promised
what
the
taste
did
not
quite
deliver
the
beer
begins
to
degenerate
rapidly
at
about
the
halfway
point
i
thought
there
was
a
faint
herbal
taste
but
it
never
reappeared
if
youre
desperate
for
a
beer
and
xxx
is
all
that
is
available
and
you
drink
it
seek
help
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
no
head
highly
carbonated
aroma
is
a
corny
sweet
maltiness
which
is
exactly
how
the
taste
starts
this
starts
like
a
normal
mainstream
lager
and
finishes
with
a
rough
full
and
strong
alcohol
taste
well
im
not
really
impressed
but
ive
not
fund
a
high
alcohol
beer
that
im
thrilled
with
and
this
probably
less
than
most
its
better
than
drinking
muddy
water
but
so
is
bud
thousands
of
drunk
college
kids
from
boston
swear
by
this
stuff
saying
things
like
ohh
its
so
strong
theyre
not
allowed
to
sell
it
in
the
us
what
a
bunch
of
bull
i
can
think
of
a
few
dozen
beers
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
beat
this
wimpy
beer
into
the
ground
as
far
as
abv
goes
with
that
being
said
this
beer
tastes
like
gasoline
it
does
have
a
high
amount
of
alcohol
but
its
all
derived
from
adjunct
garbage
and
it
shows
smells
like
wet
hay
with
cooked
broccoli
mixed
in
think
of
this
as
rolling
rock
at
7
6
usually
i
like
canadian
macros
when
put
alongside
their
american
counterparts
but
this
one
is
just
no
good
its
as
rough
around
the
edges
as
a
bandsaw
and
its
good
for
one
thing
getting
you
drunk
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
drunk
dont
bother
carting
this
stuff
over
the
border
just
get
a
40
of
some
american
malt
liquor
and
call
it
a
day
everytime
i
sip
this
beer
i
have
violent
vision
of
sweaty
bloody
canadian
hockey
fans
pummeling
eachother
i
watery
beer
with
only
one
purpose
to
get
drunk
sad
beer
has
to
be
like
this
like
i
said
before
it
has
a
malty
initial
tasteand
a
pilsnerlike
hops
aftertaste
very
light
mouth
feel
that
could
not
is
but
could
be
rather
drinkable
it
is
an
ok
beer
and
is
something
to
at
least
try
weather
you
want
to
get
sfaced
or
not
i
had
this
beer
about
a
year
ago
when
i
went
up
to
niagara
falls
canada
i
kind
of
forgot
about
this
one
until
i
saw
it
appear
in
a
liquor
store
by
me
this
was
the
only
beer
that
people
were
drinking
in
the
bars
in
niagara
which
actually
consisted
mostly
of
american
kids
it
is
7
3
alcohol
and
it
seems
like
people
had
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
would
get
them
fed
up
i
never
had
enough
to
get
me
trashed
but
i
am
sure
it
can
do
the
trick
the
only
thing
i
can
really
say
to
describe
this
beer
is
alcohol
it
smells
and
tastes
way
too
much
like
alcohol
it
is
hard
to
taste
anything
besides
the
alcohol
taste
in
your
mouth
when
drinking
this
dont
waste
your
time
on
this
beer
unless
you
want
to
do
nothing
else
but
get
drunk
and
if
thats
the
case
drink
something
else
leave
this
beer
for
the
us
frat
kids
and
yups
that
go
up
to
canada

abv
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
malt
liquor
worth
it
if
your
trying
to
get
a
cheap
buzz
and
a
killer
headache
in
the
morning
we
used
to
drink
this
stuff
on
trips
to
canada
before
legal
age
however
theres
nothing
that
special
about
it
pours
a
golden
fizzy
tone
with
white
head
that
dwindles
quickly
leaves
decent
lace
aroma
consists
of
alcohol
and
sweet

mix
of
malts
and
adjuncts
no
real
hop

taste
sweet
grainy

ridden
with
a
touch
of
rustiness
leaves
the
palate
wanting
more
no

is

this
is

with

bit
more
consistency
than
most

on

well
this
beer
has
no
real
appeal
to
someone
who
really
likes
beer
however
for
the
person
looking
for
the
gimmick
of
the
high
alcohol
and
doesnt
know
that
xxx
really
stands
for
a
belgian
style
triple
yawn
this
is
the
so
called
forbidden
molson
brew
that
is
really
just
their
malt
liquor
this
stuff
is
goldenpiss
yellow
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
dies
a
quick
death
the
aromas
are
sweet
corn
alcohol
and
ajuncts
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
aromas
with
a
faint
corn
mustiness
and
a
small
hop
snap
in
the
boozy
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
harsh
but
not
terrible
and
the
same
goes
for
the
drinkability
this
is
a
bad
brew
but
pretty
damn
good
for
a
malt
liquor
i
dont
know
whether
to
be
pissed
at
molson
for
putting
it
out
or
myself
for
being
duped
into
buying
it
all
the
hoopla
and
mystique
about
the
infamous
cant
get
it
in
the
u
s
because
its
so
potent
xxx
is
a
load
of
crap
i
was
expecting
something
other
than
what
i
got

souped

a
clear

with
a
moderate
head
that
runs
away
screaming
as
soon
as
its
formed
it
was
literally
around
for
seconds
average
at
best
the
smell
actually
isnt
that
bad
here
sweet
with
some
grain
fruit
and
candy
a
bit
thin
overall
but
decent
sweetness
dominates
the
flavour
but
is
often
too
aggressive
theres
a
bit
of
alcohol
warmth
up
front
but
other
than
that
not
much
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
stupid
gimmick
thatll
sell
well
in
the
short
term
at
least
certainly
not
great
brews
themselves
but
id
rather
a
molson

canadian
over
this
one

is
this
a

way
of
raising
prices
11
5oz
is
341ml
so
it
isnt
a
normal
metric
size
the
bottle
looks
like
a
12oz
pours
gold
and
settles
to
a
mediumamber
color
over
a
snowwhite
head
that
head
remains
for
ten
or
twenty
minutes
though
it
is
noticably
thinner
by
the
end
the
beer
itself
looks
crystal
clear
in
your
glass
start
is
flavorful
but
not
overpowering
with
a
little
bite
courtesy
of
hop
bitterness
this
beer
is
fullbodied
and
its
flavors
include
caramel
light
creme
and
wheat
mixed
with
a
generously
smooth
malty
texture
finish
is
semidry
and
the
creme
feel
of
the
beer
is
what
outlasts
the
rest
of
its
flavors
aftertaste
is
heavy
and
very
longlasting
but
not
repulsive
though
nearly
so
the
beer
is
a
golden
color
darker
than
most
macros
there
is
little
smell
slight
alochol
comes
through
thin
grassy
hops
slight
bitterness
some
adjunct
taste
good
carbonation
the
taste
is
remarkably
clean
for
such
a
high
abv
macro
the
aftertaste
is
of
sweet
faintly
burning
alcohol
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
had
out
of
the
bottle
not
the
glass
its
really
very
easy
to
drink
i
certainly
like
it
better
than
the
other
molsons
ive
tried
golden
light
canadian
export
and
it
will
drop
you
like
a
brick
if
you
choose
to
drink
it
like
any
other
macro
my
head
still
aches
after
throwing
back
a
case
with
some
friends
last
night
overall
its
pretty
good
coinsidering
this
isnt
entirely
bad
but
ill
leave
this
stuff
to
those
that
just
want
a
quick
buzz
i
was
really
surprised
the
alcohol
doesnt
dominate
the
brew
but
i
still
wouldnt
consider
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
by
any
means
well
i
was
hoping
for
a
decent
offering
from
molson
and
this
comes
pretty
closepours
a
deep
yellow
with
not
much
head
to
speak
ofaroma
is
lightly
biscuity
and
grainy
and
some
alcohol
notes
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
but
not
much
to
it
a
lightly
flavored
higher
alcohol
brew
but
not
much
to
it
good
for
drinking
with
some
bbq
but
not
something
to
savor
by
any
means
molson
xxx
is
one
of
those
beers
that
i
always
heard
my
non
beerafficionado
friends
talk
about
having
to
sneak
into
the
us
because
it
was
so
crazy
potent
kind
of
funny
considering

really
isnt
that
high
compared
to
other
better

that
have
been
available
all
along
so
now
we
have

available
at

the

and
the
flavor
seems
more
like
a
standard
lager
than
malt
liquor
very
boring
mmalthops
combination
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
the
finish
is
bubbly
without
a
lot
of
flavor
pass
but
for
its
vaguely
unpleasant
appearance
and
sour
smell
it
actually
tastes
pretty
good
one
of
the
better
macros
that
i
have
ever
had
and
goes
down
smooth
so
smooth
you
can
find
yourself
in
trouble
pretty
quicklyif
you
can
stomach
it
at
all
tastes
more
like
corn
than
anything
and
water
more
than
anything
like
corn
oddly
refreshing
but
certainly
not
a
premium
beer
the
first
for
me
of
the
molson
lineup
and
it
turns
out
to
be
a
pretty
good
xxx
the
beer
pours
a
pure
clean
looking
gold
with
a
smaller
than
expected
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
after
abit
lace
is
carbonated
and
shortlived
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
alittle
grassy
with
hints
of
alcohol
the
taste
is
of
alcoholic
malt
thats
brown
sugar
sweet
not
too
sweet
but
balanced
by
the
alcohol
more
than
the
hops
which
tend
to
hide
the
mouth
feels
carbonated
perhaps
an
adjuncts
feelsoft
cotton
drinkability
is
smooth
make
it
cold
for
a
crisp
alcoholic
bite
not
a
bad
offering
to
lead
me
to
look
into
others
in
this
line
the
alcohol
content
isnt
what
i
expected
it
to
be
i
though
it
would
be
higher
im
glad
it
didnt
taste
like
a
high
alcohol
beer
it
was
good
like
most
of
the
reviewers
have
mentioned
i
bought
this
at
canadian
dutyfree
shops
under
the
idea
that
wow
this
is
high
alcohol
and
cant
get
it
in
the
us
and
when
i
saw
it
in
the
cooler
at
sapphires
figured
id
give
it
a
try
it
wasnt
quite
as
bad
as
i
expected
and
though
not
a
world
beater
and
ive
clearly
had
abvs
far
higher
its
not
terrible
either
recommended
im
unsure
of
the
quality
especially
as
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
so
the
glass
is
filled
only
half
way
there
is
no
head
to
speak
of
the
nose
however
offers
a
spicy
parade
of
pineapple
porridge
and
cane
juice
on
the
palate
it
is
strong
and
sweet
with
chewy
fruit
gum
and
tea
flavors
fizzy
and
dry
with
slightly
rancid
tannins
on
the
finish
this
is
serious
beer
secondary
elements
of
butterscotch

and
green
wood
appear
as
it
warms
wow
this
is
canadian
malt
liquor
pure
and
simple
pours
golden
with
a
fizzy
shortlasting
white
head
aroma
is
harsh
fusel
alcohol
and
sweet
adjunct
flavor
is
surprisingly
full
for
such
a
beer
with
no
watery
taste
whatsoever
and
is
actually
beerlike
but
if
you
let
this
beer
get
anything
greater
than
fridge
temps
and
youll
feel
its
wicked
punch
and
thats
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
decent
malt
liquor
and
im
reviewing
it
as
such
really
not
horrible
for
a
macro
and
packs
a
punch
i
can
see
why
it
was
hallowed
back
in
the
day
throw
in
a
fancy
yeast
a
little
more
malt
and
you
could
convince
people
they
had
something
exotic
and
expensive
nothing
impressive
about
the
look
or
smell
of
this
beer
the
taste
is
alright
better
than
most
other
macrobrewed
beers
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
when
ice
cold
dont
let
it
warm
up
in
fact
one
nice
thing
about
the
higher
alcohol
content
is
that
you
can
get
it
colder
in
the
freezer
without
freezing
it
than
regular
molson
it
has
a
good
mouthfeel
considering
its
competition
molson
can
bud
etc
somehow
it
is
very
drinkable
but
can
easily
sneek
up
on
you
i
could
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
with
some
hot
wings
while
watching
the
red
wings
but
there
is
so
much
more
out
there
to
try
why
bother
it
pours
out
with
a
straw
color
much
like
any
of
the
big
3
beers
here
in
the
states
and
a
white
head
with
little
to
no
head
retention
perhaps
the
best
way
to
describe
this
beer
is
by
calling
it
molson
golden
on
steriods
not
a
great
beer
not
a
bad
one
it
does
not
have
too
much
flaver
very
little
hops
and
very
little
malt
however
it
does
have
a
kick
which
makes
it
almost
worth
drinking
strong
alcohol
kick
and
taste
the
story
ive
been
told
is
this
cannot
be
imported
to
the
us
because
it
would
have
to
be
labeled
as
malt
liquor
and
molson
doesnt
want
that
it
exists
mainly
to
be
in
duty
free
shops
waiting
for
americans
to
bring
it
home
both
facts
from
canadian
bartenders
they
sound
good
enough
to
me
straw
color
light
head
i
started
buying
it
when
i
first
started
drinking
and
even
now
years
later
ill
still
pick
it
up
every
time
i
come
back
from
canada
most
of
the
appeal
is
as
a
forbidden
fruit
its
better
than
ab
products
in
every
way
color
taste
abv
king
of
the
macrobrews
gold
with
a
very
short
head
that
was
short
lived
smelled
like
an
average
beer
but
seriously
this
isnt
a
taste
me
im
a
great
beer
its
got
3
huge
silver
xs
on
the
front
this
is
the
beer
for
slamming
and
getting
ripped
faster
than
the
other
macrocrapperies
can
do
it
might
as
well
enjoy
the
taste
while
youre
doing
it
but
like
its
little
brother
bradour
it
better
be
going
down
cold
this
is
a
nice
potent
canada
brew
my
folks
left
a
few
in
the
fridge
for
me
so
i
drank
them
not
a
great
beer
but
it
acomplishes
what
it
sets
out
to
acomplish
da
buzz
comes
on
quick
better
than
other
non
us
import
brews
from
canada
that
ive
sampled
sulfurous
odor
hits
the
nose
like
an
errant
highstick
dipped
in
stewed
vegetables
cloying
flavor
is
only
accentuated
by
the
hops
ugh
icebrewed
i
think
id
rather
eat
the
leftover
ice
than
drink
a
triple
x
unless
youre
a
sadist
not
recommended
pours
a
very
clear
goldenyellow
hue
with
a
thick
white
head
which
actually
left
lacy
trails
down
the
sides
of
my
5
liter
mug
tastes
similiar
to
other
macros
a
metallic
kind
of
flavor
a
present
from
my
dad
who
brought
it
back
from
a
fishing
trip
in
canada
a
buddy
had
a
sixer
of
this
he
had
carried
back
with
him
from
canada
since
he
was
in
a
sharing
mood
it
would
be
rude
of
me
to
refuse
right
in
this
case
i
should
have
try
this
only
if
you
like
sickly
sweet
highly
alcoholic
tasting
malt
liquor
i
could
barely
finish
the
12oz
bottle
yuck
this
stuff
should
only
be
consumed
with
a
paper
bag
around
the
bottle
worst
malt
liqour
ive
ever
tasted
and
i
drink
alot
of
malt
liqours
not
very
fizzy
and
the
taste
is
reminiscent
of
pure
failure
i
keep
retrying
to
buy
this
and
give
it
more
chances
and
have
only
been
able
to
finish
it
once
not
recommended
better
to
pound
2
40
oz
colt
45s
than
this
overall
more
interesting
than
many
of
the
mainstream
malt
liquors
out
there
but
not
nearly
as
refined
sloppily
hot
with
alcohol
yet
theres
still
some
charm
to
it
there
are
better
smoother
malt
liquors
out
there
o
this
was
really
impressive
and
im
hoping
to
find
it
again
some
day
a
year
and
some
change
must
have
done
it
a
world
of
good
looking
at
these
other
reviews
because
this
isnt
bad
at
all
id
say
the
real
surprise
was
the
taste
it
wasnt
the
rocket
fuel
sour
apple
concoction
that
i
expected
it
to
be
not
at
all
rather
i
would
have
to
compare
it
to
a
sort
of
microbrew
as
it
leaves
a
pleasant
aftertaste
on
the
palate
it
was
frosty
cold
which
likely
helped
out
in
the
flavor
department
but
even
as
it
warmed
the
swill
was
thoroughly
enjoyable
the
price
was
absolutely
unbeatable
at
just
over
a
dollar
for
24
ounces
a
great
value
and
a
pretty
darn
tasty
brew
i
would
give
axe
head
an
honest
recommendation
especially
for
those
on
a
budget
who
want
a
nice
drinking
experience
o
this
is
a
typical
malt
liquor
union
made
as
the
label
says
so
im
guessing
secretly
the
quality
is
even
shittier
than
normal
lets
get
black
out
drunk
gee
thanks
t
for
this
one
and
we
still
get
to
work
through
another
bottle
wouldnt
expect
anything
less
from
minhas
m
kind
of
sodalike
at
first
but
the
carbonation
goes
flat
in
record
time
for
some
unknown
reason
medium
body
but
the
level
of
boozey
hotness
strips
all
the
moisture
out
of
my
mouth
theres
boozey
and
than
theres
this
monstrosity
now
i
cant
wait
to
crack
open
the
40oz
pours
yellow
in
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
an
impressively
sweet
aroma
of
corn
and
grains
definitely
quite
a
bit
of
booze
on
the
nose
as
well
impressive
the
flavor
is
also
intensely
sweet
far
too
much
for
my
liking
boozy
and
appley
too
on
the
fuller
side
for
a
malt
liquor
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
lacks
the
finesse
of
something
like
say
evil
eye
ice
this
beer
is
like
four
loko
on
steroids
it
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
it
is
very
very
pungent
with
a
chalky
aftertaste
each
swig
is
like
a
punch
in
the
face
its
semifoamy
but
it
dissipates
quickly
upon
drinking
it
i
didnt
pour
it
into
a
glass
because
i
used
it
for
a
drinking
game
but
from
seeing
it
in
the
can
it
appeared
to
be
a
very
light
transparent
yellow
color
it
feels
heavy
on
the
palate
designed
to
get
you
drunk
for
cheap
but
with
the
amount
of
sugar
big
hangover
potential
and
poor
quality
taste
you
can
get
better
malt
liquors
for
an
extra
1
a
very
industrial
not
industrious
tasting
beer
paint
thinner
with
a
weeks
worth
of
office
kitchen
sugar
or
sugar
substitute
dumped
in
im
only
drinking
a
pawns
worth
of
this
pantsless
kings
serving
and
thats
hard
enough
as
it
is
the
crack
glug
reminded
me
of
one
of
the
real
flaws
in
these
tallboy
cans
the
opening
sits
well
back
from
the
lip
and
spilling
can
be
a
frequent
cancern
fortunately
i
have
perfected
my
art
holy
plastics
factory
batman
the
nose
smelled
like
something
totally
unnatural
and
i
had
not
even
leaned
in
for
a
whiff
i
am
already
developing
a
headache
i
had
two
fingers
worth
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
fell
faster
than
wile
e
coyote
going
off
a
cliff
the
nose
was
really
fusel
like
paint
thinner
accompanied
by
a
bazooka
bubble
gumlike
sweetness
how
do
they
accomplish
this
color
was
a
really
beautiful
deepgolden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
i
feel
like
i
should
say
at
least
one
nice
thing
about
this
beer
since
i
have
a
feeling
as
to
where
it
is
headed
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
lot
of
initial
alcohol
heat
on
the
tongue
giving
way
to
a
green
apple
and
pink
bubble
gum
flavor
oof
finish
was
literally
breathtaking
i
felt
like
the
air
had
been
sucked
out
of
my
lungs
brutal
i
cannot
recommend
this
for
even
the
hardcore
types
that
swill
this
style
in
the
alley
behind
my
house
saw
a
40
of
this
evil
liquid
for
only
1
99
how
could
i
pass
it
up
i
obviously
didnt
pour
it
into
a
glass
but
drank
it
out
of
the
bottle
out
of
a
brown
paper
bag
as
is
the
custom
tasted
like
shit
and
alcohol
teamed
up
to
punch
your
face
every
sip
at
11
this
was
expected
i
guess
certainly
got
the
job
done
best
bargain
in
the
liquor
store
clear
dark
yellow
orange
color
white
foam
that
fades
fast
doesnt
last
long
enough
to
qualify
as
head
the
smell
is
metallic
and
alcohol
no
other
discrenable
aroma
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
some
sweet
vegetable
residue
average
body
and
mouthfeel
i
guess
couldnt
finish
one
glass
let
alone
the
whole
can
it
does
carry
a
high
abv
punch
which
is
what
its
made
for
i
suppose
that
makes
it
fit
the
style
for
a
malt
liquor
dark
yellow
colored
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
and
taste
are
green
apple
and
nuclear
submarine
fuel
this
packs
a
potent
punch
it
reminds
me
of
high
school
when
you
would
drink
two
forties
of
malt
liqour
and
look
for
anyone
to
fistfight
still
i
cant
say
that
this
is
horrible
but
my
no
means
will
i
say
its
good
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
fast
the
nose
is
comprised
of
dusky
metallic
grits
green
apple
and
grain
alcohol
the
taste
is
much
like
the
smell
sweet
grits
and
appleskin
mascerated
in
corn
liquor
the
alcohol
is
relatively
well
hidden
for
such
a
high
abv
this
stuff
is
evil
for
1
09
and
at
11
abv
one
single
40
oz
could
do
serious
damage
i
guess
thats
the
point
i
chickened
out
after
about
8
oz
though
taste
this
is
a
beer
to
be
slammed
and
forgotten
about
to
end
youre
night
on
me
a
drain
pour
in
the
final
reckoning
a
more
appealing
appearance
is
the
reason
why
axe
head
wins
malt
likkapalooza
xi
ive
also
decided
to
reward
it
with
a
higher
drinkability
score
since
the
flavor
is
slightly
better
yes
its
drinkable
for
the
style
but
im
not
stupid
enough
to
drain
the
entire
40
ounce
bottle
overall
not
good
not
good
otoo
sweet
for
my
liking
may
be
interesting
as
a
cheap
lager
for
a
snakebite
not
exactly
sure
what
they
we

to
acheive
in
this
strong

low

to
compete
with

fizzy

that
quickly
disappears
to
nothing
almost
no

maybe
wet
straw

kind

taste
is
sour
on
the

watery

thin
no

and
an

have
known
better
high
alcohol
plus
low
cost
equals
no
good
rjt
could
be
an
average
malt
liquor
but
the
sweetness
makes
the
beer
disgusting
only
try
if
your
already
drunk
and
cant
notice
the
taste
p
s
edit
clear
creek
ice
tastes
a
bit
like
earthquake
tasty
and
you
have
a
popular
beer
if
those
were
the
criteria
and
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
beer
that
has
decent
flavor
but
not
the
aftertaste
of
a
usual
malt
liquor
its
a
deceiving
6

alcohol
as
its
packaging
suggests
this
is
the
pbr
they
mop
off
the
floor
served
in
a
mug
you
dont
get
a
colt
45
for
the
taste
but
as
far
as
im
concerned
its
not
that
bad
good
way
to
get
drunk
fast
and
cheap
this
shite
isnt
worth
a
review
olskool
like
oe
king
cobra
etc
not
for
a
true
beer
drinker
poor
quality
drove
while
drinking
one
of
these
in
my
younger
days
and
got
pulled
over
days
when
you
think
youre
invincible
i
couldnt
find
my
license
and
it
was
in
the
same
spot
as
always
lucky
cop
let
me
go
because
i
worked
for
state
at
the
time
and
was
a
couple
of
blocks
away
i
found
out
that
day
about
poor
quality
vs
good
quality
lol
bottoms
up
colt

malt
liquor
beer
like
beer
if
youre
drinking
colt
45
you
arent
looking
to
drink
for
taste
or
the
experience
youre
drinking
to
get
drunk
if
ive
got
3
bucks
im
wanting
to
blow
colt
45
is
a
go
to
cheap
and
doesnt
taste
god
awful
either
the
key
thing
to
remember
though
is
its
a
colt
45
gets
you
drunk
thats
it
this
beer
is
horrible
period
bought
on
a
whim
out
of
curiosity
pretty
much
instantly
regretted
not
a
beer
i
would
recommend
one
of
the
worst
of
the
cheap
brews

a
thin
head
the
smell
is
mild
although
there
is
some
malt
notes
the
taste
had
a
nice
beginning
but
there
was
a
bit
of
a
sour
almost
metallic
twinge
on
the
end
not
a
great
beer
but
by
no
means
the
worst
either
for
a
malt
liquor
it
isnt
bad
very
light
in
color
an
has
a
very
distinct
malt
smell
taste
linger
in
your
mouth
and
not
necessarily
in
a
good
way
actually
the
40oz
in
front
of
me
right
now
happens
to
be
expired
by
two
months
i
see
not
skunked
though
tastes
fine
watery
and
incredibly
easy
to
go
down
overall
afroman
didnt
write
a
song
about
olde
english
because
there
is
no
better
way
to
enjoy
a
night
of
easy
livin
like
a
colt
45
and
a
couple
of
spliffs
now
legal
for
recreational
us
in
colorado
and
washington
weighing
in
at
6
1
alcohol
by
volume
colt
is
the
second
most
boozy
beer
weve
tasted
this
year
want
to
get
ghetto
girl
wasted
without
having
to
sacrifice
your
taste
buds
look
no
further
than
colt
45
it
works
every
time
was
broke
and
wanted
a
beer
not
my
proudest
moment
buying
this
stuff
but
for
a
couple
bucks
for
a
40
who
cares
it
was
expired
a
few
months
and
came
with
a
free
one
smells
like
old
budweiser
thats
been
left
in
a
red
solo
cup
all
night
i
took
a
swig
and
damn
it
was
so
bad
i
spit
it
on
my
windshield
tasted
like
old
gym
socks
and
pig
feed
corn
i
threw
that
bottle
out
the
window
of
my
car
nasty
terrible
stuff
afroman
lied
to
us
well
when
im
broke
and
want
to
get
a
buzz
goin
this
will
probably
be
leaving
the
store
with
me
certainly
not
my
proudest
moments
but
i
dont
care
not
really
much
for
taste
to
write
home
about
theres
of
course
a
pretty
obvious
maltiness
to
it
besides
that
theres
just
like
a
stale
bread
taste
which
is
just
about
as
appealing
as
it
sounds
i
could
be
missing
some
flavors
since
i
just
chug
it
before
it
gets
too
warm
or
flat
but
im
sure
im
not
missing
much
when
it
comes
to
40s
though
this
is
one
of
the
better
choices
overall
if
you
just
want
to
get
a
buzz
on
the
cheap
pick
one
of
these
up
another
added
bonus
is
you
can
blast
some
wutang
and
pretend
youre
in
a
90s
rap
music
video
if
thats
what
youre
into
its
not
an
impressive
beer
but
it
is
perfect
for
those
days
when
your
taste
buds
yearn
for
a
taste
of
grain
and
a
nonintrusive
beer
o
not
bad
at
all
a
little
less
of
a
rich
flavor
than
an
old
e
very
fond
of
that
one
the
flavor
of
grain
kernels
sticks
out
alcohol
seems
a
notch
or
two
more
exposed
ill
stick
with
my
old
e
though
i
wont
refuse
this
when
offered
it
there
are
far
better
choices
if
you
are
a
fan
of
malt
liquor
colt
45
what
more
can
you
say
colt
45
malt
liquor
brewed
by
the
pabst

this

an
abv
of
5
61
colt
45
brew
pours
out
a
nice
amber
color
with
a
small
white
head
the
smell
of
this
brew
is
corn
and
beer
that
is
it
nothing
different
from
other
malt
liquors
on
the
market
the
taste
is
smooth
clean
and
refreshing
there
is
no
harsh
after
taste
it
is
smooth
this
brew
goes
down
smooth
nothing
bad
about
this
brew
mouth
feel
is
nice
and
smooth
and
refreshing
this
malt
liquor
is
one
of
the
smoothest
i
had
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
3
out
of
5
i
will
get
this
brew
again
o
i
might
even
buy
this
again
if
im
that
strapped
its
not
a
bad
value
and
certainly
beats
the
hell
out
of
a
bmc
light
colt

out
a
very
nice

a

it

from
a
quart
bottle
pours
to
an
attractive
thick
white
head
and
erratic
but
substantial
lacing
strangelooking
clear
tarnished
gold
color
aroma
is
sweet
alcoholic
but
vegetal
asparagus
and
grainy
with
no
discernible
hop
character
flavor
is
much
of
the
same
as
aroma
but
very
palatable
and
easy
to
drink
mouthfeel
is
light
and
bubbly
and
surprisingly
smooth
as
in
it
does
not
have
astringency
or
excessive
carbonic
bite
overall
this
is
drinkable
and
mostly
unoffensive
believe
it
or
not
not
really
good
at
all
but
not
bad
there
are
much
worse
cheap
adjunct
brews
out
there
i
guess
im
not
a
beer
snob
after
all
i
reviewed
this
beverage
on
its
merits
as
a
cheap
drink
and
party
brew
and
give
it
no
more
than
a
3
0
for
any
flavor
or
aroma
ratings
really
for
the
style
it
is
one
of
the
best
but
im
not
giving
4s
all
around
for
any
malt
liquor
no
matter
how
on
style
it
is
malt
liquors
are
for
getting
a
buzz
not
craft
beer
savoring
anyway
overall
this
beer
is
getting
worse
with
warming
even
faster
than
i
would
imagine
i
had
so
much
hope
for
it
when
it
was
so
pretty
anyway
not
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
but
you
might
even
be
better
off
going
with
a
mickeys
o
ive
had
worse
as
far
a
malt
liquor
goes
its
not
bad
but
as
far
as
beer
goes
its
near
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
would
probably
drink
this
over
certain
macro
lagers
though
enjoy
p
s
if
i
could
buy
head
in
a
can

533as
i
said
and
if
one
is
to
consume
party
beer
a
quick
40oz
drink
that
will
do
the
trick
thats
it
d
expectations
are
a
bitch
but
this
was
honestly
better
than
id
anticipated
pretty
easydrinking
nothing
overtly
offensive
granted
i
have
no
plans
of
finishing
the
entire
40
but
i
can
imagine
there
are
worse
malt
liquors
out
there
d
could
not
finish
my
24oz
can
just
to
sweet
and
messy
feel
is
light
airy
and
slightly
tingly
though
im
not
sure
where
those
tingles
are
coming
from
average
feel
for
a
below
average
brew
drinkability
is
only
average
if
this
is
served
at
the
proper
temperature
ice
cold
i
could
of
had
a
mickeys
it
was
right
next
to
it
living
the
dream
to
be
sure
though
d
i
have
had
many
a
malt
liquor
over
the
years
tonight
my
buddy
had
a
4pack
at
a
street
party
so
i
indulged
i
think
this
is
lesser
than
haffenreffer
or
crazy
horse
rip
but
way
better
than
oe800
mickeys
st
ides
etc
the
main
problem
in
my
view
aside
from
mediocre
taste
is
that
it
is
disagreeable
to
the
digestive
system
colt
45
is
a
very
clear
very
sparkling
pale
golden
lager
with
a
thin
soft
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
and
leaves
decent
lacing
it
has
a
corny
slightly
sweet
aroma
with
notes
of
corn
funk
and
maybe
lemon
its
mediumlight
bodied
and
tinny
with
a
starchy
papery
finish
its
slightly
sweet
and
doesnt
really
have
any
bitterness
it
tastes
like
beer
breath
fusel
is
detected
its
almost
tolerable
it
works
but
not
every
time
rjt
d
drinks
a
bit
better
than
most
malt
liquors
im
not
sure
what
youre
expecting
from
a
malt
liquor
but
this
is
light
and
yet
very
malt
no
off
flavors
at
all
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
simple
american
macro
beer
this
is
actually
very
very
good
the
high
abv
and
big
malt
really
shine
compared
to
bud
or
miller
etc
for
what
it
is
i
really
like
it
either
way
i
recommend
it
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
i
guess
a
forty
ounce
counts
as
a
bottle
there
isnt
much
to
say
about
this
one
poured
a
light
yellow
fizzy
head
that
didnt
last
long
kind
of
smells
and
tastes
like
old
corn
best
consumed
as
close
to
frozen
as
possible
and
as
fast
as
possible
the
only
reason
to
pick
this
over
other
malt
liquors
is
because
lando
calrissian
was
in
the
commercials
for
it
in
the
80s
as
my
partner
in
crime
mimicked
my
actions
we
strolled
towards
the
gym
pausing
only
at
a
trash
receptacle
to
dispose
of
the
evidence
it
was
at
this
time
we
vowed
to
never
repeat
these
deeds
at
least
not
until
next
tuesday
overall
its
not
very
good
but
i
was
expecting
a
disaster
and
this
beer
beat
my
expectations
poured
out
of
a
16
oz
bottle
into
a
sam
adams
boston
lager
glass
i
doubt
jim
koch
had
this
swill
in
mind
when
they
designed
this
glass
but
it
will
certainly
be
classier
than
a
brown
paper
sack
color
is
straw
yellow
with
no
head
i
wouldnt
describe
the
beer
has
hazy
but
it
gives
the
appearance
that
your
glass
has
a
film
covering
it
smells
sweet
and
skunked
taste
is
surprisingly
not
hateful
its
sweet
for
sure
but
the
skunky
smell
doesnt
show
itself
too
bad
in
the
taste
hops
is
not
really
discernable
but
there
is
a
bitter
note
that
lets
you
know
its
there
i
cant
believe
i
used
to
knock
these
back
in
the
45oz
size
in
college
on
certain
ie
brown
bag
night
occasions
this
isnt
nearly
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
i
see
the
abv
isnt
outrageous
so
the
huge
dump
of
sugars
to
get
the
alcohol
up
there
like
in
many
malt
liquors
wasnt
the
route
taken
with
this
one
a
12oz
sample
would
suit
me
better
but
the
24oz
isnt
the
greatest
chore
ive
ever
put
myself
through
bottom
line
its
ok
but
itll
probably
be
years
before
i
visit
it
again
im
more
of
mickeys
fine
malt
liquor
fan
mouthfeeldrinkability
icky
and
i
could
not
get
past
a
few
ounces
lando
calrissian
no
colt
45
doesnt
taste
too
good
i
really
couldnt
perceive
anything
but
a
slightly
maltymetallic
taste
with
no
nose
it
is
cheap
fairly
drinkable
and
once
had
billy
dee
williams
as
a
spokesman
i
mean
no
its
not
great
but
not
entirely
nasty
so
at
6
what
the
f
if
youre
looking
for
a
buzz
on
the
cheap
this
is
a
good
choice
not
horrible
tasting
but
certainly
nothing
id
offer
to
guests
at
my
house
has
the
noticable
alcohol
flavor
of
a
cheap
malt
liquor
but
c45
is
not
as
harsh
as
the
others
you
can
actually
get
one
down
id
recommend
it
as
a
good
choice
before
a
cheap
rock
concert
a
late
season
football
game
or
before
an
event
as
a
pregame
so
you
dont
have
to
spend
too
much
on
booze
in
the
venue
gives
you
a
rockin
buzz
but
dont
overdo
it
serve
this
swill
ice
cold
on
with
the
review
so
i
just
moved
to
south
carolina
from
upstate
ny
i
went
to
my
local
kroger
to
purchase
some
cheep
beer
to
my
surprise
no
40s
only
quarts
1
32
an
unbeatable
price
i
got
home
and
opened
it
the
smell
was
different
than
it
normally
has
the
colt
45
funk
was
not
there
but
replaced
with
a
sour
smell
almost
like
aluminum
can
and
garbage
i
was
horrified
i
drank
half
and
i
was
done
the
reason
i
gave
it
a
5
in
drinkability
is
because
i
can
drink
a
lot
of
colt
45
this
is
the
king
of
session
beers
when
ever
i
go
out
for
a
night
on
the
town
its
a
colt
45
pregame
party
im
still
looking
for
the
holy
grail
1512oz
cans15
pack
that
no
one
seems
to
ever
have
in
there
stores
in
the
meantime
i
will
pray
to
the
beer
gods
that
someday
i
will
find
it
and
drink
every
single
one
end
of
the
bottle
recommend
to
drink
it
cold
and
fast
now
i
wanna
put
on
a
white
sleeveless
shirt
and
teach
my
wifes
cat
a
lesson
in
respect
come
ere
kitty
you
aint
gonna
dis
me
no
more
while
im
certainly
not
going
to
start
sucking
back
colt
45
every
weekend
i
actually
think
i
might
buy
it
again
itll
get
a
few
laughs
from
the
friends
and
itll
go
down
nice
and
smooth
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
one
of
the
better
malt
liquors
that
ive
had
and
even
though
its
not
the
stronger
one
out
there
its
still
a
costefficient
way
to
get
a
buzz
going
which
is
what
this
kind
of
beer
is
intended
for
d
the
taste
is
a
deterent
but
while
sitting
around
with
the
boys
i
could
have
one
cheers
the
mouth
on
this
was
a
tad
better
than
the
miller
i
just
consumed
a
smidge
more
carbonation
playing
on
the
tongue
a
smidge
this
beer
has
a
bit
more
flavor
and
dare
i
say
bite
some
sweet
malts
come
through
but
not
enough
the
cheap
husky
grains
are
the
main
player
this
will
do
at
a
softball
game
or
something
but
otherwise
this
will
not
be
a
regular
in
my
drinking
plans
poured
from
a
clear
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
mild
malt
smell
not
much
aroma
taste
is
slightly
malty
mostly
bland
o
k
feel
in
mouth
and
drinkability
is
average
a
good
beer
to
get
wasted
with
otherwise
not
so
great
not
going
to
win
any
awards
but
good
in
a
pinch
drink
ice
cold
and
quickly
though
i
got
to
say
i
still
prefer
this
beer
out
of
intended
glassware
the
bottle
and
a
paper
bag
the
paperbag
shields
you
from
the
contents
the
aroma
is
kicked
up
because
i
cant
smell
it
the
taste
is
still
corn
grain
the
balancing
bitterness
comes
from
that
charcoal
filtered
flavor
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
more
present
but
this
may
only
be
because
how
fast
i
am
drinking
this
beer
drinkability
is
improved
from
the
bottle
in
short
i
highly
reccomend
this
buzz
beer
from
the
bottle
ice
cold
and
drank
as
fast
as
you
can
clear
golden
with
a
soft
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
trace
lacing
behind
smells
of
grits
and
slightly
soapy
tastes
sweet
and
corny
with
cereal
grains
and
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
on
the
back
end
medium
bodied
with
fizzy
carbonation
i
always
thought
this
was
a
lot
stronger
that
6
1
abv
in
my
younger
days
when
me
and
my
friends
would
choke
down
40
oz
bottles
of
colt
with
reckless
abandon
a
pretty
average
malt
d
it
is
what
it
is
a
cheap
malt
liquor
that
is
meant
to
be
had
in
large
amounts
not
the
best
tasting
brew
but
goes
down
pretty
easy
after
returning
for
some
god
awful
reason
to
this
hell
hole
of
brews
i
realize
my
first
impressions
were
not
so
accurate
as
i
would
like
them
to
be
let
me
be
honest
the
bottle
itself
scares
me
my
dad
used
to
store
premixed
weed
killer
in
these
bottles
when
i
was
a
kid
and
guess
what
it
was
the
same
color
as
the
stuff
in
this
unopened
bottle
of
c45
the
color
is
by
far
the
worst
part
of
this
beer
especially
in
the
bottle
the
nose
was
a
bit
less
offensive
but
still
nothing
to
get
exited
about
the
taste
however
is
surprising
in
that
it
is
not
too
far
from
many
macro
lagers
especially
the
ice
versions
eg
bud
ice
keystone
ice
etc
mouthfeel
is
just
nicely
carbonated
and
light
and
the
only
reason
the
drinkability
isnt
higher
on
my
ratings
is
because
after
a
few
40s
your
out
of
the
game
for
a
while
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
had
once
before
and
its
not
anywhere
as
bad
as
i
remembered
this
malt
is
smooth
and
easy
drinking
has
allot
more
flavor
with
a
little
more
alcohol
than
say
king
cobra
pretty
easy
to
consume
as
much
as
you
wanted
not
bad
with
only
very
minor
flavors
that
may
be
offensive
to
one
as
it
warms
i
definitely
will
be
buying
again
i
liked
it
i
recommend
you
give
it
a
try
cheers
d
okay
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
but
not
worthy
conclusion
its
a
drinkable
maltliquor
when
its
75
at
happy
hour
and
youve
never
tried
it
before
thats
about
it
well
if
youre
gonna
pick
up
a
few
of
these
then
you
must
already
have
low
expectations
we
bought
these
as
a
joke
we
spent
the
night
listening
to
old
school
gangsta
rap
and
downed
a
few
forties
the
taste
sucked
but
the
atmosphere
was
spot
on
tastes
really
cheap
the
alcohol
shows
through
and
not
in
a
good
way
it
was
really
foamy
and
and
light
in
color
it
was
like
natty
light
and
sprite
mixed
together
t
goes
without
saying
that
this
is
a
bad
call
for
humanity
while
colt
45
may
not
win
many
awards
it
has
one
at
least
one
the
key
to
my
heart
nothing
high
class
by
any
means
but
if
youre
hanging
around
with
a
couple
friends
looking
just
to
goof
around
or
dirt
poor
living
on
ramen
noodles
pretending
youre
not
in
youre
apartment
to
avoid
bill
collectors
since
theres
no
money
even
though
i
am
since
i
have
no
where
else
to
goyou
i
mean
you
have
no
where
else
to
go
anyhow
what
i
mean
is
its
a
decent
cheap
malt
liquor
to
get
you
by
and
a
solid
choice
for
college
or
chilling
around
on
the
cheap
with
some
friends
alright
this
is
gonna
be
reviewed
according
to
style
here
this
is
malt
liquor
so
it
needs
to
reviewed
in
the
realm
of
malt
liquor
anyway
pours
that
coppery
color
with
decent
head
i
didnt
pour
all
of
it
into
a
glass
so
i
dont
know
about
head
retention
and
besides
who
cares
when
its
a
malt
smell
is
fruity
boozy
adjuncty
could
of
been
hidden
better
for
7
taste
is
great
for
a
malt
its
my
3rd
favorite
malt
so
its
just
slighty
above
average
goes
down
kind
of
rough
finishes
sweet
and
boozy
not
bad
mouthfeel
full
and
sticky
after
a
710
ml
can
the
next
one
is
easy
so
drinkability
is
solid
keep
swillin
thats
right
katz
kittenz
it
was
malt
liquor
night
at
my
house
again
out
of
a
22oz
bottle
this
beer
was
a
clear
gold
color
with
a
moderate
amount
of
rising
carbonation
the
aroma
was
of
semisweet
malt
with
some
light
floral
notes
on
grain
mash
much
better
than
i
expected
the
flavors
however
were
about
what
i
was
thinking
it
was
very
dry
dominated
by
doughy
malt
and
some
grain
mash
acidic
the
mouthfeel
was
semirough
the
body
medium
and
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
not
bas
as
far
as
they
go
enjoying
this
after
a
rainier
ale
no
bad
attributes
whatsoever
in
the
lower
abv
range
of
mls
this
is
perfection
get
some
now
this
was
poured
out
a
40
fl
oz
bottle
marked
03099f51136
i
picked
up
one
of
these
40
ouncers
to
watch
the
wild
card
playoffs
i
figured
id
milk
it
for
the
rest
of
the
day
it
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
whole
lot
of
fizzy
white
head
and
actually
a
little
bit
of
lacing
it
smells
metallic
and
looks
like
most
cheap
american
pales
although
the
taste
ends
slightly
dry
it
leaves
an
after
taste
and
a
headache
eh
nothing
special
here
but
it
is
really
really
cheap
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
14
inch
head
but
poor
retention
slight
lacing
throughout
smells
of
a
lager
with
secondary
maltiness
fits
the
style
well
enough
slightly
sweet
flavor
consisting
mostly
of
cleanliness
of
a
lager
with
some
sweet
malt
average
carbonation
and
a
crisp
body
not
real
bad
a
little
kick
with
the
higher
abv
the
taste
and
smell
are
putrid
mouthfeel
is
nothing
impressive
and
i
cant
even
tell
you
about
drinkablility
does
it
even
matter
arent
you
suppose
to
slam
these
anyways
colt
45
is
like
an
on
going
joke
with
me
and
my
friends
but
given
the
right
situation
and
mood
id
still
to
this
day
take
that
40
down
colt
45
malt
liquor
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
sixteen
ounce
can
theres
not
much
going
on
in
the
aroma
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
is
noticeable
there
isnt
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
either
a
bit
of
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
grain
thats
about
it
not
as
offensive
as
i
remembered
it
for
some
reason
this
reminds
me
a
little
of
iced
tea
and
is
about
as
drinkable
one
of
my
old
high
school
staples
so
it
deserves
some
props
for
that
it
isnt
something
i
would
drink
today
however
i
might
break
a
forty
or
two
out
for
a
night
out
with
some
old
high
school
buddies
this
stuff
doesnt
drink
too
bad
at
least
im
not
disgusted
like
i
would
be
with
a
bud
light
or
something
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
colt
45
though
its
been
years
since
ive
had
it
ive
never
approached
it
with
a
critical
eye
its
better
than
a
lot
of
american
macros
and
the
abv
while
somewhat
low
for
the
style
is
well
hidden
in
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
some
might
debate
whether
the
rogue
offering
shouldnt
take
home
the
prize
because
it
is
craft
beer
hey
the
name
of
this
invite
is
brown
paper
bag
which
conjures
malt
liquor
and
the
rogue
offering
is
that
if
you
dont
like
it
do
your
own
well
time
to
wrap
this
up
no
pun
intended
thanks
for
watching
the
brown
paper
bag
invitational
good
night
everyone
this
is
a
malt
liquor
that
is
cheap
and
gets
the
job
done
lightbodied
with
good
carbonation
if
i
couldnt
smell
or
taste
it
i
could
drink
colt
45
all
day
long
i
could
drink
this
in
a
smaller
increment
but
a
40
is
way
too
much
having
said
that
for
what
it
is
it
really
isnt
horrible
when
its
cold
that
is
which
means
you
have
about
5
minutes
to
choke
down
whatevers
in
your
glass
my
beverage
of
preference
colt
45
oh
boy
golden
color
topped
with
a
white
head
that
fizzles
away
just
go
ahead
and
brown
bag
it
and
drink
from
the
bottle
tastes
very
musty
with
dust
particles
corn
and
low
grade
malts
theres
decent
amount
of
alcohol
in
this
especially
for
the
price
but
you
wont
see
me
getting
near
this
one
awful
this
one
was
made
in
canada
with
an
8abvlite
pale
yellow
with
small
white
head
and
thin
lacing
nose
was
cornskunksome
rice
maybe
and
the
high
alcohol
faintly
coming
thrutasted
like
mashed
cornwith
some
hints
of
sweets
and
musty
with
the
alcohol
taste
finishing
off
and
lingering
in
the
backgroundmedium
mouthfeel
that
left
you
waiting
a
while
before
you
really
wanted
to
glug
some
morenot
to
my
liking
bought
a
forty
of
this
the
other
day
when
i
was
younger
i
would
buy
this
from
time
to
time
and
it
wasnt
terrible
like
other
malt
liquors
ive
had
but
i
had
to
reassure
myself
so
i
turned
on
afroman
and
drank
my
colt
45
i
was
pretty
pleased
with
my
purchase
it
does
leave
a
strange
coating
in
your
mouth
but
it
quickly
disappears
easy
to
drink
and
it
gets
you
drunk

if
i
were

on
the

this
would
be
my
choice
update
as
it
warmed
its
now
the

for
real

it
ended
up
getting
unbearably

poured

nothing
the
taste

the

kind
of
leaves
me
queasy
its
not
quite
of
chemicals
but
its
nasty
feel
is
lightly
crisped
from
the

not
drinkable
unless
you
are
a
crackhead
that
needs
a
cheap
buzz
sick
drinkability
is
okay
if
youre
in
a
pinch
or
you
feel
like
going
cheap
otherwise
save
the
money
for
a
much
more
fulfilling
beer
d
gimme
nother
fortee
poured
this
beer
into
my
united
we
stand
pint
glass
this
beer
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
just
a
hint
of
carbonation
that
foams
up
but
has
no
head
retention
at
all
the
smell
is
sweet
corn
syrup
and
thats
about
all
the
taste
is
clean
and
adjuncty
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
with
just
a
hint
of
booze
that
is
normally
really
prevalent
in
cheap
malt
liquors
this
would
be
a
really
easy
summer
drinking
brew
give
it
to
me
on
a
float
trip
any
day
apperance
yellow
with
some
carbonation
that
quickly
disapates
there
are
smells
of
grains
corn
alcohol
and
some
sugar
not
that
bad
of
a
tastes
not
to
strong
on
the
alcohol
good
taste
for
a
malt
liqour
sort
of
like
pabst
with
a
little
more
alcohol
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
not
that
bad
but
thin
all
around
finally
the
drinkability
is
good
if
you
are
into
malt
liquors
probably
the
best
one
out
of
all
the
malts
out
there
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
with
a
strong
corn
tortilla
taste
a
definite
but
not
unpleasant
alcoholic
quality
and
a
warm
alcoholic
corn
finish
that
has
a
light
bite
it
has
almost
no
bitterness
and
in
the
end
gets
somewhat
watery
with
a
light
soapy
quality
but
is
otherwise
inoffensive
this
is
okay
and
as
ususal
similar
to
other
malt
liquors
its
yellow
and
bubbly
with
a
white
the
aroma
is
of
syrupy
grains
corn
and
some
alcohol
the
taste
is
again
syrupy
with
a
lot
of
grain
and
alcohol
this
is
some
rough
stuff
thick
full
body
cheap
and
does
the
trick
i
guess
eric
d
drinkability
was
fair
and
actually
not
bad
at
one
at
two
became
predictable
and
at
three
showed
its
true
macro
colors
and
became
a
little
bit
of
a
struggle
to
enjoy
its
flavor
a
40oz
bottle
was
sampled
40oz
bottle
white
elephant
gift
gee
thanks
unsightly
clear

color
with

with

minimal
lacing
aroma
of
corn
hay
and
grain
light
body
with
a

more
corn
and
other
farmrelated
flavors
the
finish
is
an
adjunctridden
mess
of
corn
and
maybe
some
malt
andor
hops
the
only
thing
about
colt
45
i
can
see
working
every
time
is
reminding
people
to
appreciate
the
good
beers
they
can
buy
instead
of
this
stuff
take
it
for
what
it
is
worth
whats
not
to
love
i
would
like
to
thank
my
coworker
for
taking
me
out
for
a
drink
of
course
he
and
i
have
polar
opposite
views
on
beer
so
when
he
told
me
he
got
some
good
shit
to
drink
i
shouldve
expected
this
i
drank
these
once
in
a
while
and
some
people
think
theyre
the
worst
40s
ever
but
i
think
for
a
buck
theyre
not
too
bad
pale
gold
color
that
you
can
see
right
through
not
much
in
the
nose
except
alcohol
syrupy
mellow
taste
that
doesnt
leave
too
much
backwash
needless
to
say
i
only
had
one
d
ill
drink
these
again
but
not
on
a
regular
basis
couldnt
do
a
all
nighter
with
these
sometimes
im
in
the
mood
for
the
malt
taste
drinkabilitydont
even
go
there
i
almost
puked
after
a
glass
of
this
while
in
college
this
was
the
cheapest
40
oz
i
could
find
tastes
like
straightup
gasoline
would
not
recommend
this
beer
unless
you
were
trying
to
get
wasted
for
under
3
50
horrible
gasolineoil
taste
becomes
nauseating
after
a
while
although
if
you
can
force
down
the
first
one
the
rest
go
down
a
bit
easier
cheap
ghetto
strong
malt
liquor
that
should
be
avoided
at
all
costs
somehwat
attractive
when
youre
living
off
50
a
week
unless
you
lack
dignity
and
taste
buds
ignore
this
beer
that
might
as
well
have
been
brewed
by
exxon
a
two
four
of
colt
45
bought
at
the
local
liqour
store
for
a
dollar
and
change
poured
a
bit
into
a
small
glass
light
yellow
with
minimal
head
that
reduces
to
almost
nothing
just
some
wispiness
light
corn
and
alcohol
in
the
smell
mellow
taste
is
on
the
mellow
end
as
well
sweet
cornmalt
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
thankfully
no
harsh
solvency
this
really
isnt
that
bad
as
far
as
malt
liqours
go
though
i
couldnt
imagine
drinking
this
on
a
regular
basis
try
to
tame
the
colt
for
yourself
d
an
ok
malt
liquor
but
the
taste
got
boring
after
a
while
and
monotonous
it
was
cool
to
taste
the
beer
that
lando
calrissian
pitched
in
the
late
70s
and
early
80s
but
i
dont
think
ill
be
buying
this
again
not
nearly
good
but
not
undrinkable
24oz
can
pours
a
clear
very
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
rocky
persistant
head
aroma
is
weak
corn
and
grassy
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
a
bit
watery
mouthfeel
but
you
wouldnt
want
this
to
be
very
heavy
pretty
drinkable
when
you
rate
this
for
the
style
this
is
a
decent
malt
liqour
after
drinking
a
40oz
of
this
the
review
is
hard
to
write
but
i
will
give
it
a
shot
anyways
for
2
50
this
is
a
hard
bargain
to
beat
i
expected
this
to
taste
like
total
ass
however
its
not
too
shabby
better
than
bud
in
most
respects
but
not
as
good
as
the
miller
high
life
which
has
a
special
place
in
my
heart
i
e
cheap
college
heart
it
looks
a
boring
straw
yellow
but
a
little
darker
and
smells
like
crap
but
the
taste
is
surprisingly
standable
some
what
sweet
and
chuggable
if
you
really
need
to
get
drunk
which
is
probably
the
only
reason
you
are
having
this
drinkability
is
pretty
high
there
is
alot
of
kick
in
this
40
and
damn
i
feel
it
better
stick
this
one
in
the
freezer
for
a
while
before
drinking
makes
it
10x
better
this
is
one
of
the
best
drinks
to
get
drunk
on
obviously
its
main
purpose
comes
in
the
badass
40oz
size
pours
a
light
yellow
color
with
some
decent
foam
and
lacing
aroma
is
strong
much
like
a
typical
malt
liquor
smooth
and
as
someone
mentioned
i
would
agree
to
it
being
pbr
on
steroids
taste
is
very
smooth
and
somewhat
sweet
maltycorny
flavors
not
offensive
at
all
goes
down
smooth
cheap
its
got
the
hallmarks
of
a
malt
liquor
what
more
could
anyone
expect
d
excellent
a
great
cheapo
beer
that
is
far
superior
to
other
malt
liquors
this
is
the
one
ghetto
beer
that
i
actually
enjoy
maybe
our
grandpas
had
it
better
than
i
thought
honestly
this
beer
does
what
it
was
designed
to
do
it
has
easy
drinkability
with
a
decent
taste
this
combined
with
a
decent
alcohol
level
gives
the
drinker
exaclty
what
they
expected
cheers
colt
45
is
ice
cold
hands
down
the
best
forty
youll
ever
drink
this
is
sort
of
like
saying
that
jenny
mccarthy
is
more
appealing
than
pamela
anderson
or
that
arbys
is
better
than
mcdonalds
while
all
true
statements
at
that
point
its
really
all
a
matter
of
style
to
me
this
is
landos
drink
sorry
tupac
ides
is
nice
and
all
but
youd
never
helped
saved
han
from
carbonite
slightly
less
of
a
guilty
pleasure
summer
day
tailgating
letting
it
all
hang
out
brew
than
high
life
but
in
the
same
ballpark
and
theres
not
a
damned
thing
wrong
with
that
the
finishing
taste
of
it
is
weird
but
other
than
that
the
buzz
was
great
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
thin
head
that
fades
after
a
minute
highly
carbonated
and
looks
better
than
most
malt
liquors
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
smells
like
wet
bud
light
in
a
paper
bag
doesnt
taste
too
bad
actually
tastes
like
some
of
the
macro
beers
that
cost
a
bit
more
mouthfeel
isnt
so
good
tastes
like
a
maltliquor
though
not
as
bad
as
steel
reserve
isnt
so
bad
to
drink
probably
one
of
the
better
maltliquors
pours
like
malt
liquor
clear
ambergold
small
soapy
white
head
goes
fast
some
lace
spots
not
much
average
smell
is
sweet
and
corny
some
vegetables
bit
of
alcohol
not
much
going
on
taste
is
very
sweet
some
corny
vegetal
flavour
caramel
alcohol
pretty
smooth
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
low
carbonation
pretty
average
d
much
better
than
other
malts
i
could
actually
finish
it
without
regreting
it
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
like
malt
liquors
and
enjoy
the
bitter
sweet
intoxication
16
oz


aftertaste
of
slight
caramel
and
light
hopps
poured
from
a
40
oz
bottle
gee
maybe
i
could
get
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
sometime
the
pour
foamed
up
pretty
well
smell
was
allright
thought
it
might
be
good
afterall
had
a
pretty
decent
flavor
at
first
could
taste
a
full
flavored
mouth
of
adjuncts
on
the
downside
i
found
hardly
any
carbonation
hop
flavor
or
finish
to
add
quite
honestly
the
aftertaste
tasted
like
sinussinus
drainage
probably
the
only
bottle
of
beer
ive
never
finished
i
had
to
throw
this
stuff
out
or
i
think
i
would
have
gotten
sick
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
and
its
supposed
to
be
a
pretty
good
malt
i
will
be
staying
away
from
this
category
for
sure
drinkability
its
okay
as
long
as
your
40s
really
cold
the
moment
it
starts
to
warm
up
it
taste
really
bad
also
a
great
beer
if
you
just
want
to
get
trashed
quickly
and
cheaply
but
certainly
a
poor
mans
beer
it
seems
absurd
to
review
this
in
the
normal
format
though
appearance
was
piss
yellow
no
lacing
poor
retention
smells
like
corn
tastes
like
bitter
alcoholic
corn
that
said
it
goes
down
easily
enough
especially
when
cold
wouldnt
want
to
attempt
the
feat
when
its
just
cool
mouthfeel
a
little
slick
but
carbonation
is
good
as
far
as
malt
liquor
goes
it
gets
a
lot
worse
than
this
one
here
taking
style
into
account
its
not
bad
overall
yes
it
is
final
statement
everyone
should
drink
one
of
these
at
one
point
in
their
lives
i
drank
2
and
maybe
i
will
again
who
knows
d
it
is
alright
it
is
of
course
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
it
does
go
down
fairly
easy
i
imagine
that
the
clear
bottle
would
be
vastly
inferior
to
the
can
its
100
degrees
outside
i
have
a
ice
cold
colt
45
and
life
isnt
so
bad
it
is
a
typical
cheap
malt
liquor
but
it
is
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
and
packs
a
good
buzz
for
the
price
pour
one
for
your
dead
homies
and
keep
a
couple
for
yourself
sure
you
could
be
drinking
a
good
pilsener
but
sometimes
its
ok
to
be
ghetto
this
malt
liquor
is
horrid
the
stuff
looks
like
a
concentrated
budweiser
with
a
healthy
dose
of
horse
or
cow
urine
it
smells
like
fermented
infection
juice
the
delicate
flavor
is
that
of
gasoline
and
rotting
corn
if
youve
ever
wondered
what
a
chemical
cocktail
would
taste
like
3
months
past
its
bornon
date
this
stuff
is
it
enjoy
i
guess
the
idea
behind
this
beer
and
most
malt
liquors
is
to
drink
it
cold
as
possible
and
as
fast
as
possible
for
ultimate
enjoyment
bottom
line
just
not
reccomended
unless
your
a
fan
of
malt
liquor
which
i
am
not
the
beer
pours
a
very
bright
gold
a
thin
fluffy
head
sits
atop
the
beer
it
looks
like
an
na
the
smell
is
worse
all
i
can
smell
is
adjunct
sweetness
the
taste
proves
that
the
smell
is
not
a
lie
the
only
taste
is
a
very
musty
sweet
one
the
mouthfeel
is
okay
until
it
gets
to
the
back
of
my
tounge
where
it
turns
into
battery
acid
it
is
to
sweet
to
really
pound
down
or
drink
casually
this
is
an
okay
malt
i
should
add
i
use
that
word
lightly
the
appearance
is
pretty
decent
nothing
to
bad
the
smell
isnt
good
the
taste
is
sub
par
the
mouth
feel
is
okay
ive
drank
this
several
times
but
it
has
never
been
very
easy
to
drink
it
in
more
than
small
sips
because
honestly
it
makes
me
sick
to
take
large
swigs
overall
a
great
hobo

beer
appearance
light

its
doesnt
look
too
unappetizing
aroma
cereal
grains
light
toasted
pale
malts
with
heavy
corn
and
rice
providing
some
evident
sweetness

touch

well
this
is
where
it
gets
harsh
this
ones
definitely
for
my
homies
corn
husk
offness
slightly
metallic
adjunct
ridden
in
the
worst
way
no
hop
flavor
brings
out
just
a
bit
of
my
gag
reflex
is
it
worth
the
24
oz
99
cent
offering
to
drink
this
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
a
bit
thicker
than
the
typical
mass
produced
lager
a
bit
of
residual
sugars
drinkability
well
no
dont
drink
alot
of
this
or
a
little
in
multiple
sittings
not
good
beer
even
for
a
malt
liquor
had
a
bbq
today
one
of
my
bastard
friends
thought
it
was
funny
to
bring
this
fortunately
my
other
bastard
friend
brought
an
old
crustacean
bottle
on
to
this
mess
though
cracked
it
open
made
an
obligatory
lando
remark
due
to
past
marketing
typical
yellow
but
not
clear
more
of
a
golden
straw
very
foamy
smells
of
stale
corn
flakes
and
carbonation
tastes
artificial
tastes
corny
tastes
bad
it
was
hard
to
drink
i
couldnt
get
through
much
of
this
can
the
big
two
four
beat
me
why
did
i
feel
so
dirty
buying
this
from
a
small
wine
glass
the
appearance
was
a
light
yellow
color
with
abundant
bubbles
the
aroma
was
lacking
it
smelled
of
rotting
silage
the
first
sip
was
mild
it
tasted
like
a
light
tonic
with
a
hint
of
corn
on
the
second
sip
i
swirled
it
around
in
my
mouth
and
it
reminded
me
of
a
hot
summer
day
i
slowly
finished
the
first
glass
and
poured
a
second
glass
the
second
glass
seemed
better
than
the
first
glass
my
nerve
endings
were
dulled
and
the
more
i
drank
or
this
the
more
i
wanted
to
drink
im
not
sure
why
maybe
there
is
an
additive
in
colt
45
that
makes
it
addictive
anyone
know
macros
gotta
love
them
pale
yellow
pour
smells
like
water
tastes
like
water
these
beers
challenge
you
to
find
the
flavor
there
is
very
little
some
sweet
graininess
but
that
is
it
its
yellow
carbonated
water
mouthfeel
is
like
carbonated
water
very
drinkable
but
its
completly
mindless
oh
well
its
good
for
low
budget
beer
drinkers
drinkabitity
like
i
said
after
jack
hammering
all
day
or
paving
a
long
driveway
on
a
hot
day
this
is
the
way
to
go
or
perhaps
drink
a
few
before
that
4th
of
july
softball
game
that
no
one
cares
who
wins
or
who
gets
hurt
a
semifinalist
in

2006
this
was
a
fairly
smooth
drinking
ml
with
no
gaginducing
qualities
save
the
distinct
odor
of
tuna
fish
yeah
i
just
really
dont
want
my
beer
to
smell
like
tuna
dont
get
me
wrong
i
like
tuna
on
a
sandwich
or
in
sushi
but
keep
it
away
from
beer

to
olde

smell
of

and

with
a
bit
of

not
intense
by
any
means
flavor
is
surpisingly
full
but
not
very
complex
mostly
rice
and
corn
adjunct
alcohol
that
leaves
a
medicinal
taste
fairly
decent
mouthfeel
this
is
a

of

money
crystal
clear
10k
gold
toped
with
a
huge
bright
white
head
of
small
and
medium
bubbles
that
slowly
settles
like
meringue
leaving
moderate
lacing
eventually
it
reduces
itself
to
a
modest
cap
a
few
lazy
carbonation
streams
rise
to
the
surface
the
smell
is
crisp
and
corn
husk
and
rice
are
prominent
there
is
a
sticky
sweetness
about
it
the
taste
is
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
but
distinctly
adjunct
laced
with
corn
and
rice
dominant

are

but
not

almost
cloying

overly
sweet
pours
out
a
pale
straw
yellow
very
clear
a
little
carbonation
and
a
nice
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
pretty
quickly
to
a
tiny
colar
though
it
sticks
a
little
to
the
glass
smells
sweet
and
malty
surprisingly
sugary
and
sweet
a
touch
of
hops
in
the
nose
it
just
reminds
me
of
a
generic
macro
a
little
bit
maltier
but
it
also
has
a
strange
tartness
in
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
a
little
grainy
and
a
little
more
full
than
id
like
in
this
type
of
beer
it
just
makes
it
a
little
less
drinkable
than
id
like
this
is
undrinkable
i
poured
it
out
after
like
6
ounces
just
crap
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
very
large
white
puffy
head
that
almost
immediately
disappeared
smell
is
very
minimal
with
only
a
slight
sweetish
note
to
be
found
taste
is
mostly
sweet
and
any
hops
present
are
minimal
finishes
with
little
taste
but
is
refreshing
an
average
beer
drinkability
smooth
which
makes
this
more
dangerous
than
it
looks
i
was
on
my
second
glass
before
i
even
realized
i
had
drank
that
much
for
a
party
definitley
recommended
still
even
cheap
beers
can
harbor
good
memories
it
says
g
heileman
brewing
reminding
me
of
my
dads
howmetown
in
la
crosse
maltysugar
type
taste
with
some
grain
this
one
doesnt
get
as
syrupy
as
most
do
when
they
warm
up
it
held
its
composition
well
if
this
was
a
couple
notches
higher
in
abv
id
be
impressed
but
at
6
1
its
decent
it
is
what
it
is
and
they
do
a
decent
job
at
it
appearance
is
this
orange
color
doesnt
really
look
too
appetizing
it
smells
horrible
like
alcohol
and
something
metallic
i
cant
really
describe
surprisingly
however
it
really
doesnt
taste
that
bad
has
this
warming
sensation
while
you
drink
it
aftertaste
is
unique
a
lot
better
than
i
remember
it
being
in
my
younger
years
this
is
pretty
drinkable
and
a
good
choice
for
cold
weather
warms
you
up
and
hits
you
quick
for
a
cheap
brew
i
would
likely
go
for
this
again
again

worst
idea
ever
this
is
okay
beer
if
your
expectation
meter
is
set
on

bottom
if
one
is
in
need
of
a
drinkable
remarkably
inexpensive
beer
with
a
kick
one
could
do
much
worse
than
an
ice

or
three
of

the

a
little
malty
better
taste
than
you
average
malt
liquor
also
smoother
than
some
american
macros
this
is
a
beer
that
tastes
more
like
an
american
macro
in
a
less
harsh
malt
liquor
kudos
to
pabst
champions
of
good
cheap
beer
its
colt
45
this
stuff
is
a
good
malt
liquor
if
you
get
it
fresh
enough
i
would
compare
it
to
a
slightly
stronger
slightly
drier
high
life
nice
to
whack
back
a
couple
22ozs
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
has
a
slightly
metallic
character
that
doesnt
really
get
in
the
way
of
its
poundability
drink
one
or
die
thanks
to
larry
bell
for
inspiring
the
quote
however
inadvertently
this
beer
has
2
things
going
for
it
billy
dee
is
one
baddass
mofo
and
pbr
is
one
badass
can
of
pisswater
aside
from
that
this
stuff
aint
worth
the
99
cents
if
you
want
to
feel
like
a
pimp
then
go
ahead
and
make
the
investment
but
if
you
are
looking
to
enjoy
what
you
are
drinking
then
dont
bother
this
malt
liquor
has
a
dark
bronze
color
to
it
with
a
nice
study
white
head
i
get
a
sweet
corn
husk
aroma
along
with
what
i
detect
to
be
hops
could
it
be
taste
has
that
corn
syrup
malt
liquor
sweetness
but
its
not
overly
sick
like
some
there
might
actually
be
some
hop
flavor
in
here
leveling
this
beer
out
finish
is
dry
and
lingering
in
alcohol
drink
cold
like
all
malt
liquors
but
this
was
more
enjoyable
than
most
not
bad
at
all
seriously
minimal
head
average
carbonation
has
a
distinct
raw
alcohol
finish
easy
to
drink
while
still
cold
although
as
it
warmed
slightly
i
didnt
find
it
offensive
at
all
i
can
see
having
one
of
these
during
a
fight
night
on
tv
with
some
pork
rinds
not
bad
got
this
baby
on
a
whim
the
night
before
my
highland
games
comp
in
sumter
sc
figured
it
would
be
overly
sweet
and
clingy
with
a
thick
taste
but
actually
turned
out
to
be
rather
smooth
definately
had
the
corn
taste
to
it
but
also
had
some
maltiness
and
a
little
tiny
bit
of
hops
very
clean
taste
left
no
nasty
aftertaste
on
the
palate
believe
it
or
not
this
ba
kind
of
enjoied
it
id
say
go
for
it
if
your
into
malt
liquors
and
big
bottles
of
cheap
beer
lord
knows
its
got
the
right
price
if
you
thought
you
were
picking
up
something
classy
and
came
home
with
colt
45
you
will
be
disappointed
had
one
of
these
last
night
and
it
was
sure
a
trip
in
time
back
to
3
years
ago
where
i
discovered
the
concept
of
a
40
anyways
clear
glass
bottle
didnt
bother
to
pur
it
its
a
40
afterall
clear
medium
gold
color
lots
of
carbonation
smell
is
grainy
and
corny
not
much
of
an
appealing
malt
or
a
hops
presence
at
all
take
an
american
macro
make
it
skunkier
and
less
palatable
and
then
you
have
colt
45
pretty
bad
but
will
give
you
a
buzz
my
head
still
hurts
i
thought
i
would
drink
some
of
the
american
big
breweries
beer
the
stuff
america
was
brought
up
on
plus
i
need
to
save
money
poured
yellow
big
white
head
aroma
malty
citrus
skunky
flavor
none
the
oly
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
big
white
head
the
the
lacing
the
only
way
to
drink
this
is
ice
cold
and
fast
on
a
hot
day
overallafter
tasting
this
there
is
no
point
to
buy
bud
ice
or
natty
ice
colt
45
is
much
smoother
and
more
drinkable
granted
it
isnt
a
top
notch
beer
by
any
means
but
in
the
drink
quick
and
cheap
to
get
drunk
category
i
dont
think
you
could
do
much
better
mmmmmm
good
this
beer
has
magical
properties
when
consumed
properly
from
a
40oz
container
there
should
be
another
column
in
the
ratings
for
value
this
would
get
a
6
0
1
99
for
40
ounces
of
malt
liquor
bliss
a
malt
liquor
for
the
true
connoisseurs
postscript
im
reviewing
within
the
style
here
drinkability
a
good
answer
for
beer
on
a
budget
but
its
boring
for
anything
outside
of
a
frat
party
camping
trip
or
malt
liquor
swillathon
even
when
it
comes
to
malt
liquor
in
40s
this
stuff
is
just
stupid
to
buy
if
you
absolutely
need
40
ozs
of
high
alcohol
malt
liquor
get
olde
english
or
mickeys
this
stuff
is
almost
undrinkable
510
im
not
drinking
this
again
i
dont
care
how
poor
i
am
there
is
no
way
im
drinking
this
swill
fo
shizzle
more
drinkable
than
you
would
think
it
beats
a
budweiser
i
really
enjoyed
this
its
better
than
every
macro
lager
ive
had
this
is
thicker
dirtier
and
better
kind
of
a
rich
maltysemisweet
cheerio
taste
with
some
power
and
a
little
bit
of
kick
the
price
is
right
at
under
2
for
a
40
smells
like
alchohol
but
nothing
too
rank
i
didnt
pour
but
it
left
a
soapy
film
that
slid
down
the
sides
of
the
bottle
looks
golden
and
dirty
feels
perfect
on
the
tongue
body
and
carbonation
are
just
right
i
will
definitely
buy
this
again
one
of
my
favorite
american
lagers
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
cheapest
malt
liqours
available
on
the
market
today
here
in
virginia
it
only
costs
1
49
for
a
bottle
that
is
a
helluva
great
price
to
get
trashed
on
i
drank
three
of
these
the
other
night
and
i
felt
pretty
good
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
for
such
a
cheap
malt
liquor
very
surprising
definitely
worth
the
money
overall
this
is
not
bad
and
is
definitely
drinkable
better
than
some
of
the
cheaper
macros
i
dont
plan
on
buying
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
i
had
to
get
me
a
40
after
a
bad
day
at
work
it
was
just
how
i
remembered
it
ice
cold
out
of
the
bottle
nothings
better
it
has
a
nice
beer
like
color
to
it
with
a
thick
fluffy
head
the
smell
was
of
dirty
socks
the
taste
was
like
kind
of
bud
with
a
terrible
aftertaste
not
a
bad
malt
liquor
smells
like
napalm
in
the
morning
this
is
a
truely
offensive
brew
to
the
nasal
passages
but
if
youre
just
looking
for
something
to
get
a
quick
buzz
off
of
or
a
gag
this
is
for
you
tried
this
in
the
traditional
40oz
incarnation
and
i
have
to
say
ive
had
much
worse
deep
gold
hue
with
a
grassycorn
taste
to
it
high
in
alcohol
content
so
as
billy
dee
williams
says
it
works
every
time
if
thats
what
youre
going
for
if
youre
on
a
budget
skip
the
natural
light
and
all
that
crap
and
grab
some
of
this
it
actually
has
some
taste
and
looks
like
real
beer
works
every
time
i
seem
to
be
getting
alot
of
cheap
beer
lately
fortunately
i
havent
payed
for
any
of
them
when
i
first
poured
this
out
of
the
can
i
learned
an
important
lesson
dont
pour
this
outta
the
can
drink
straight
from
the
can
grainy
colour
carbonated
no
head
smelled
of
alcohol
malt
and
corn
tasted
the
same
way
with
a
terrible
aftertaste
drinking
from
the
can
was
a
slight
improvement
in
that
i
didnt
smell
the
beer
as
strongly
god
awful
brew
for
those
only
interested
in
a
cheap
buzz
something
not
even
i
got
from
this
this
brew
poured
a
small
head
of
white
medium
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
disappeared
leaving
a
carbonated
weak
light
yellow
body
it
has
that
typical
low
quality
rice
beer
aroma
and
a
fizzy
flavor
there
is
no
real
character
to
this
gassy
beverage
burp
24
oz
can
oh
yuck
another
american
massproduced
beer
this
beer
poured
a
small
white
head
with
smallmedium
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
there
was
no
lacing
observed
with
this
beer
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
there
was
carbonation
observed
rising
to
the
top
it
had
a
fruity
nose
macro
with
an
attitude
looks
like
macro
tastes
like
macro
on
steroids
and
priced
like
macro
everything
but
appearance
is
a
bit
below
average
this
has
been
around
a
long
time
and
hasnt
improved
this
is
really
a
good
marketing
effort
of
a
fairly
poor
beer
not
a
bad
malt
its
got
a
decent
flavor
but
is
better
when
its
icy
cold
had
a
strong
smell
of
alcohol
and
malt
and
was
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
if
i
am
going
to
drink
a
malt
its
gonna
be
this
id
say
to
those
who
are
not
versed
in
malts
to
try
this
one
first
as
i
think
this
one
is
as
good
as
it
gets
it
is
actually
far
better
than
i
thought
it
would
be
there
is
no
head
no
colour
no
aroma
no
hops
but
there
is
a
smooth
malt
taste
with
a
nice
warming
alcohol
finish
i
think
the
smoothness
and
the
lack
of
the
generic
macro
metallic
bite
makes
this
stuff
quite
drinkeable
it
has
quite
a
good
body
and
the
carbonation
is
quite
softnice
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
if
you
are
not
in
the
mood
for
thinking
about
what
you
are
drinking
light
pale
golden
hue
white
head
smallish
with
minimal
retention
unpleasant
nose
sulfur
sweet
and
hints
of
grain
first
few
sips
are
shocking
to
the
palate
rebounds
grainy
gritty
malty
sweet
underlying
notes
of
spiciness
not
very
flavorful
but
not
bad
alcohol
is
somewhat
noticeable
drinkable
for
a
malt
liquor
beer
it
is
cheap
22
oz
bottle
for
1
40
but
that
still
wont
motivate
me
to
purchase
this
again
plus
how
can
one
go
wrong
when
billy
d
williams
is
the
spokes
man
colt
45
is
a
quaffable
beverage
and
probably
considered
a
tame
malt
liquor
easy
to
drink
and
theres
worse
out
there
no
colt
45
review
is
complete
without
giving
props
to
billy
dee
so
it
works
every
time
conservatively
priced
at
under
4
00
for
a
six
pack
colt
45
malt
liquor
will
be
there
for
you
if
the
need
should
ever
arise
ready
willing
and
able
to
satisfy
the
most
basic
of
needs
for
a
beer
clear
golden
color
with
lots
of
fat
bubbles
and
a
small
white
head
quite
good
lace
for
the
style
the
most
notable
characteristic
of
the
aroma
is
a
strong
alcohol
presence
though
there
is
a
decent
malt
aroma
which
is
a
bit
overpowered
by
the
alcohol
fumes
taste
begins
with
aggressive
spritzy
carbonation
and
alcohol
flavors
beneath
the
alcohol
flavor
there
is
a
decent
cracker
malt
presence
and
some
hops
and
grain
as
well
finish
is
dominated
by
sweet
alcohol
flavors
and
a
touch
of
hop
bitterness
mouth
feel
is
pretty
good
for
this
style
this
beer
is
a
standout
in
a
category
that
does
not
get
much
respect
from
beer
connoisseurs
it
also
offers
very
good
value
for
its
modest
price
ill
certainly
buy
this
one
again
if
you
look
close
enough
at
my
pic
thats
me
as
a
baby
playing
with
a
colt
45
can
since
i
cant
get
this
brew
in
fm
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
while
home
over
thanksgiving
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
since
there
is
a
story
my
parents
told
me
about
colt
45
and
how
i
was
conceived
lol
anyway
on
to
the
review
it
pours
out
pale
straw
with
a
nice
big
foamy
head
and
all
kinds
of
lace
that
sticks
forever
the
anticiapted
adjunct
aroma
doesnt
offend
its
even
expected
and
welcome
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
is
followed
by
a
bit
of
alcohol
afterbite
it
tastes
pretty
good
for
a
malt
liquor
probably
the
best
malt
liquor
you
can
buy
even
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
a
nice
warming
sensation
is
detected
after
a
few
of
these
i
got
a
sixer
of
12
ouncers
a
very
good
malt
liquor
however
the
taste
is
not
bad
it
isnt
good
either
but
it
is
not
bad
if
a
quick
buzz
is
in
your
immediate
forecast
this
is
the
brew
for
you
12
oz
clear
glass
bottle
with
the
call
me
to
win
neck
label
that
features
a
young
hispanic
or
black
woman
classy
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
straw
gold
body
topped
by
a
foamy
bright
white
head
that
holds
well
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
a
very
light
touch
of
hops
the
body
is
medium
with
a
standared
carbonation
that
leaves
it
crisp
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
is
a
well
balanced
lightly
sweet
and
grainy
maltiness
with
an
underlying
bitterness
and
very
limited
hop
flavor
it
finishes
dryish
with
a
mild
lingering
sweetness
this
is
less
sweet
and
more
balanced
than
many
malt
liquors
on
the
market
although
it
doesnt
seem
as
well
brewed
drinking
this
liquid
from
a
paper
bag
i
feel
like
a
rummy
the
malt
flavor
is
present
but
drowned
out
by
the
overwhelming
taste
of
bad
alcohol
by
bad
alcohol
i
mean
a
taste
not
unlike
nail
polish
remover
billy
dee
says
it
is
good
i
will
tried
it
again
pale
straw
with
moderate
head
that
lasts
for
a
little
while
sweet
alcoholic
tonic
like
aroma
beer
is
somewhat
pedestrian
with
minimal
hop
bitterness
and
a
full
grainy
mouthfeel
from
the
use
of
corn
and
other
veggies
finishes
warm
but
dont
drink
this
warm
this
is
one
of
the
few
malt
liquors
i
have
tried
a
cheap
40oz
favorite
of
a
late
friendgod
rest
his
soul
the
color
is
bad
the
smell
is
not
any
better
and
drinkablity
should
only
be
done
quickly
i
cant
believe
this
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
drank
ah
the
good
ole
days
of
chugging
40s
of
the
colt
bought
at
the
ghetto
party
store
and
brought
out
under
cover
of
cardboard
boxes
what
the
hell
were
we
thinking
upon
revisiting
this
beer
it
is
apparent
that
billy
dee
was
using
this
to
get
his
wimmins
buzzed
and
not
himself
somewhat
sweet
taste
of
burnt
corn
and
nearly
flat
peace
out
its
cheap
malt
liquor
it
will
get
you
all
fd
up
just
chug
while
its
cold
and
get
nicely
tanked
because
that
is
definitely
all
you
are
looking
for
anyway
am
i
wrong
i
didnt
think
so
i
cant
help
but
chuckle
when
i
think
of
this
stuff
somehow
this
always
found
its
way
back
from
the
store
in
the
old
days
when
we
would
pitch
in
for
beer
strictly
for
those
looking
for
a
quick
nasty
buzz
a
friend
of
mine
always
brings
over
a
couple
four
os
of
this
stuff
as
a
gag
funny
thing
is
that
we
end
up
polishing
the
stuff
off
everytime
never
considered
trying
this
but
a
buddy
bought
several
types
of
really
cheap
beer
to
see
which
was
the
best
in
a
relative
sort
of
way
he
put
tape
around
the
cans
to
hide
the
id
have
we
got
too
much
time
on
our
hands
or
what
moderate
body
with
a
mildly
alcohol
front
a
firm
middle
and
a
moderate
nonhop
bitter
finish
not
all
that
bad
i
about
fell
out
of
my
chair
when
he
peeled
the
tape
off
i
would
have
fallen
out
the
chair
anyway
after
a
couple
more
this
is
awful
avoid
at
all
costs
i
used
to
drink
this
on
occasion
back
in
the
1960s
i
cant
be
sure
but
this
reminds
me
of
the
green
death
of
old
i
didnt
think
it
was
that
high
an
abv
but
that
might
explain
the
crazy
behavior
of
the
young
folks
that
drank
it
the
body
is
very
light
and
carbonation
isnt
as
high
as
i
would
expect
its
a
little
flat
as
well
as
thin
with
a
beer
like
this
you
at
least
expect
some
crispness
this
has
a
bit
but
not
enough
just
a
really
sweet
ale
with
no
redeeming
quality
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
orangewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
fruity
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
sugary
chlorine
and
vegetal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
an
almost
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
poor
beer
with
a
decent
aroma
but
its
not
very
drinkable
with
the
odd
flavors
i
am
getting
but
a
lot
of
serious
memories
tied
up
in
this
stuff
drinkability
i
didnt
like
it
very
much
it
would
be
better
colder
and
thats
what
i
will
do
with
the
rest
that
i
got
from
the
40oz
tasting
with
elrogish
back
in
the
day
yeah
man
that
one
ugh
d
6
79
for
a
6pack
of
pint
cans
a
de
facto
8pack
so
around
a
fiver
for
a
sixer
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
bud
in
this
price
range
not
too
bad
at
all
id
probably
put
this
more
in
the
cream
ale
category
than
malt
liquor
as
macro
as
it
is
it
does
show
a
bit
of
an
ale
yeast
character
think
genesee
but
a
little
worse
but
cheaper
plus
the
can
looks
sweet
the
body
was
typically
thin
drinkability
is
dependent
on
your
taste
for
this
style
overall
for
a
cheap
strong
fizzy
yellow
beer
this
isnt
totally
terrible
and
pretty
average
for
the
style
bought
the
sixer
while
drunk
only
because
it
looked
comically
bad
the
can
says
copyright
rainier
brewing
company
irwindale
ca
but
im
0
surprised
to
discover
an
association
to
g
heileman
it
looks
ok
in
a
glass
but
smells
like
my
grandparents
old
recycle
bin
full
of
special
export
empties
or
a
derivative
of
any
of
their
other
swills
it
claims
to
be
an
ale
but
definitely
has
a
malt
liquor
taste
and
feel
if
you
really
like
mickeys
or
steel
reserve
but
are
on
a
budget
grab
yourself
an
ice
cold
rainier
otherwise
stay
away
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
sweet
cereallike
taste
finish
was
too
sweet
to
distinguish
it
from
other
beers
man
i
cannot
get
in
front
of
this
one
oh
lord
the
green
death
light
yellow
with
a
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
quite
pleasant
kind
of
like
a
forest
with
a
lot
of
wet
leaves
on
the
ground
then
you
actually
taste
it
sugary
sweet
corn
and
cereal
with
the
taste
of
rotting
wood
and
when
i
say
rotten
wood
i
can
only
imagine
it
is
that
log
you
see
lying
in
the
mud
that
breaks
apart
when
you
touch
it
ugh
white
head
golden
ale
cut
grass
sweet
thin
taste
all
delectable
adjectives
when
describing
this
watered
down
pabst
i
enjoyed
it
and
felt
deliciously
white
trash
drink
it
also
for
1
39
its
hard
to
beat
the
price
so
put
on
your
mesh
beer
drinking
hat
bust
out
your
skoal
and
throw
down
a
tall
can
if
you
have
to
drink
malt
liquor
this
is
a
fantastic
way
to
stand
out
in
a
crowd
and
still
get
nasty
mountain
fresh
the
taste
is
lightly
but
consistently
malty
with
a
lot
of
grain
a
hint
of
pine
light
fruitiness
a
warm
pungency
and
a
spicey
grain
finish
it
is
lightly
sweet
with
faint
bitterness
while
the
alcohol
mostly
adds
to
the
body
and
spicy
warmth
without
any
offputting
odd
moldy
fruit
or
vinegary
wine
qualities
that
such
beers
sometimes
have
its
very
smooth
and
satisyfing
in
its
pungency
sixteen
ounce
aluminum
can
color
of
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
of
skunk
and
metal

taste
of
bile
and
skunk
body
is
watery
and
with
high
carbonation

aftertaste
of
bile
just
horrible
i
could
not
finish
this
so
called
liquid
claiming
to
be
beer
either
the
formula
has
changed
which
i
do
believe
based
upon
the
color
or
my
taste
buds
have
grown
immensely
i
used
to
hold
this
beer
in
such
high
esteem
i
no
longer
do
this
is
pretty
much
easy
to
drink
hooch
at
this
point
ive
got
to
say
this
is
more
of
a
malt
liquor
than
a
cream
ale
anyhow
it
pours
out
to
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
of
white
foam
that
held
up
pretty
well
aromas
of
fresh
young
hops
and
mild
adjunct
and
malts
taste
was
fair
for
a
brew
with
such
a
high
abv
medium
bodied
malts
and
sharp
grains
with
corn
and
hops
blending
in
to
give
the
notion
of
malt
liquor
alcohol
is
noted
mouthfeel
is
slighlty
smooth
and
has
some
consistancy
drinkability
is
average
at
best
special
thanks
goes
out
to
dubbercody
for
the
40
oz
sample
do
not
mistake
this
for
a
decent
beer
it
is
simply
something
that
is
easily
inhaled
quickly
when
in
need
of
a
quick
bout
of
blacking
out
it
beats
the
pants
off
of
malt
liquor
40oz
beers
and
should
be
heralded
as
king
of
40z
like
no
other
ale
ive
ever
tasted
this
is
even
a
poor
attempt
at
a
brown
bag
park
bench
buzz
bomb
no
ale
character
at
all
no
head
to
speak
of
corney
boiled
corn
in
the
aroma
sweet
corn
dextrose
and
alcohol
in
the
taste
weak
pale
gold
color
no
aroma
of
grain
to
speak
of
just
a
sweet
vegetal
taste
filled
with
adjuncts
and
a
half
hearted
attempt
at
an
astringic
hop
flavor
i
got
stuck
buying
a
sixpack
to
sample
this
and
i
feel
cheated
rainier
ale
is
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
the
beer
geek
or
someone
that
isnt
in
the
mood
for
a
challenge
so
if
you
find
yourself
in
the
great
northwest
grab
this
nw
classic
that
is
now
brewed
in
tx
all
in
all
not
one
ill
jump
back
into
if
i
only
have
2
bucks
in
my
pocket
and
want
a
decent
malt
liquor
this
would
be
up
for
consideration
dumped
from
a
twelve
ounce
can
into
a
standard
beer
mug
the
head
rises
assertively
and
has
the
color
and
consistency
of
cool
whip
the
body
is
straw
yellow
translucent
smell
opens
with
a
wad
of
cotton
candy
that
has
perhaps
been
mysteriously
lingering
in
a
corpulent
persons
back
pocket
for
an
afternoon
a
musty
sweetness
the
middle
pulls
out
some
wacked
weed
earthiness
some
hints
of
hop
activity
and
finishes
with
a
waft
of
waterlogged
garbage
dank
sickly
sweet
taste
cheekclenching
all
four
of
them
at
first
due
to
an
extreme
pinch
of
spoiled
powder
sugar
sweetness
worse
than
that
its
like
taking
a
shot
of
equal
straight
on
the
tongue
the
middle
has
an
old
orange
pulp
bite
like
sucking
a
wedge
that
has
already
been
sucked
and
left
to
sit
for
at
least
an
entire
day
not
that
ive
ever
done
that
towards
the
end
the
alcohol
heat
takes
over
warming
the
throat
to
the
point
where
i
think
yes
yes
warmth
take
over
the
taste
however
the
alcohol
heat
has
the
reverse
effect
of
reinforcing
the
saccharine
sweetness
and
the
painfully
thin
and
rusty
hop
presence
if
you
can
even
call
it
a
presence
mouthfeel
well
imagine
having
a
cold
a
sinus
drip
at
3
99
a
sixpack
and
7
3
abv
im
sure
it
is
easy
to
imagine
what
this
will
taste
like
imagine
a
weaker
steel
reserve
thats
basically
all
rainier
ale
is
starts
off
tasting
sweet
like
your
normal
macro
but
as
it
goes
down
you
taste
the
extra
alcohol
on
the
back
of
your
tongue
not
as
evident
as
in
steel
reserve
but
it
tastes
as
if
they
just
poured
some
everclear
into
the
batch
to
raise
the
abv
not
bad
if
youre
going
for
a
hobo
brew
but
stick
to
normal
rainier
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
decent
tasting
beer
the
cream
of
the
crop
pun
intended
among
the
constituents
of
the
bif
13

from
hell
package
from
beeradvocate
drewbage
this
baby
came
in
a
green
16
oz
can
that
broke
the
record
for
overuse
of
a
word
by
mentioning
that
this
quality
brewed
rainier
ale
is
a
mountain
fresh
ale
and
that
the
can
holds
one
pint
ale
and
then
repeating
this
on
the
other
side
of
the
can
just
for
good
measure
pouring
it
in
a
standard
pilsner
glass
revealed
an
ultra
pale
straw
colored
body
with
a
fizzy
artificial
head
the
aroma
was
sugary
sweet
and
the
taste
confirmed
the
adjunct
laden
origin
of
the
alcohol
here
taste
was
basically
fermented
sickly
sweetened
water
passed
over
corn
flakes
this
thin
and
mineralized
tasting
malt
liquor
had
a
mouthfeel
like
a
bad
headache
waiting
to
happen
thank
god
the
old
college
days
of
drinks
like
this
are
a
distant
foggy
memory
thanks
to
the
blackouts
induced
by
the
alcohol
this
is
not
an
ale
overall
meh
way
way
too
sweet
to
my
taste
without
anything
to
balance
but
its
cheap
if
thats
where
your
thrill
lies
as
for
it
being
a
cream
ale
not
quite
much
too
big
too
much
alcohol
burn
and
too
much
residual
sweetness
to
match
the
likes
of
little
kings
or
genesee
in
that
style
belongs
in
the
sink
this
is
actually
a
very
good
deal
for
1
70
a
40
ozer
a
step
above
many
macros
its
not
great
but
i
can
see
why
many
used
to
like
this
before
the
dawn
of
the
micro
beers
i
began
with
two
fingers
of
fizzy
french
vanillacolored
head
that
hung
in
pretty
well
in
the
face
of
the
humidity
that
is
helping
to
keep
me
up
tonight
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
and
suddenly
croesus
and
king
midas
were
back
to
their
fighting
knock
it
off
this
is
not
worthy
of
your
efforts
nose
smelled
like
a
minhas
product
and
i
do
not
mean
that
in
a
good
way
plastics
pink
bubble
gum
dry
cleaning
fluid
were
all
perceived
could
it
get
any
worse
yes
the
taste
was
burnt
rubber
and
a
metallic
tang
that
made
me
wonder
from
what
kind
of
glass
the
bottle
was
made
whew
finish
was
bonedry
and
i
was
afraid
to
breathe
near
any
open
flames
phew
i
will
not
be
allowing
this
to
warm
up
it
might
selfcombust
mman
snoop
lion
says
that
his
jawnt
works
every
time
and
i
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
this
gem
will
work
equally
well
the
best
example
of
a
really
poor
style
do
i
now
taste
eau
de
cigarette
ashtray
i
knew
i
did
not
want
this
warming
pours
a
yellow
transparent
color
with
a
white
head
with
average
retention
sweet
corn
skunky
aroma
more
of
the
same
in
the
taste
pretty
light
body
considering
the
abv
fairly
straight
forward
malt
little
with
a
bit
of
a
funk
to
it
not
looking
to
drink
this
again
overall
this
is
definite
a
lot
better
than
most
of
the
malt
liquors
ive
tried
so
i
give
them
props
for
that
probably
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
though
it
has
a
gross
filmy
slickness
that
is
like
glycerine
literally
phlegmlike
and
utterly
disgusting
low
carb
levels
makes
it
a
chore
to
drink
with
an
astringent
bite
dumping
the
rest
now
nasty
a
poor
choice
even
for
a
novelty
40
buy
stay
far
far
away
from
this
garbage
calling
this
crisp
or
easily
drinkable
is
laughable
been
a
while
since
i
tried
a
new
malt
liquor
so
why
not
something
random
i
found
during
my
last
visit
to
kenosha
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
offwhite
froth
the
nose
comprises
light
hard
water
light
sweet
flowers
and
very
light
grass
almost
no
smell
going
on
here
the
taste
holds
notes
of
corn
sour
wheat
spicy
hard
water
i
really
hope
that
makes
sense
to
someone
other
than
me
and
grass
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
not
much
to
see
here
it
isnt
horrid
thankfully
but
its
nowhere
near
good
chilled
40ozer
drank
from
a
swanky
new
alchemist
glass
beer
poured
a
translucent
straw
yellow
with
just
under
a
finger
of
head
that
soon
melted
away
into
nothingness
leaving
barely
a
hint
of
lace
nose
was
sweet
grainy
with
a
hint
of
corn
and
alcohol
the
taste
was
much
more
pleasant
than
the
smell
sweet
light
corn
and
grain
subdued
alcohol
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
went
down
smooth
no
aftertaste
for
the
low
cost
and
the
elevated
strength
if
you
dont
mind
a
bit
of
repetitive
albeit
mild
soulless
sweetness
this
goes
down
none
too
shabbily
but
if
you
just
came
from
downing
a
slurpee
from
the
macs
next
door
to
the
liquor
store
then
i
can
see
why
that
wouldnt
bother
you
in
the
least
like
most
malt
liquors
it
starts
off
tasting
horrible
but
its
not
hard
to
get
used
to
it
it
is
cheap
as
hell
and
it
shows
in
the
taste
i
bought
it
more
or
less
as
a
joke
and
i
only
had
6
ounces
of
it
that
was
enough
overall
this
beer
is
nothing
fancy
made
to
get
you
drunk
for
cheap
although
i
prefer
this
over
other
malt
liquors
as
it
is
fairly
easy
to
drink
the
label
alone
stands
out
from
other
40s
not
bad
at
all
cheap
and
easy
to
drink
of
course
what
more
do
you
expect
if
i
were
in
a
pinch
id
probably
buy
it
again
the
problem
is
its
a
ferry
ride
across
the
lake
for
it
feel
is
also
very
light
and
crisp
most
likely
due
to
the
temperature
as
this
warms
the
nastiness
comes
out
making
it
hard
to
drink
id
say
it
has
average
drinkability
when
cold
decreasing
rapidly
as
this
brew
warms
never
had
it
before
it
was
on
sale
to
be
honest
i
wish
i
didnt
spend
the
money
the
beer
left
a
funny
taste
in
my
mouth
and
and
was
a
bit
flat
to
begin
with
as
malt
liquors
go
this
one
is
better
then
others
ive
had
in
the
past
all
in
all
ive
had
better
it
was
1994
we
were
on
the
michigan
state
university
campus
on
a
typical
saturday
night
party
search
my
buddy
anthony
was
old
enough
to
buy
beer
so
he
did
he
bought
me
a
99
cent
40
oz
of
big
bear
i
was
only
19
without
getting
into
detail
we
had
a
great
night
that
night
by
the
end
of
the
night
i
had
a
huge
cut
on
my
right
knee
anthony
taped
a
wad
of
napkins
on
my
gushing
bloody
knee
at
bells
pizza
on
grand
river
it
ws
42094
i
know
that
because
i
kept
the
bottle
from
that
night
and
that
date
was
scribed
onto
the
bottle
along
with
our
signatures
my
blood
is
still
on
the
bottle
anyway
i
guess
the
purpose
of
this
site
is
to
review
the
taste
of
beers
and
not
the
memories
behind
beers
but
in
this
case
the
memory
is
way
better
than
the
taste
the
taste
sucks
the
beer
sucks
what
we
did
that
night
was
great
d
not
bad
at
all
just
try
not
to
smell
it
heilman
makes
the
best
cheapo
beer
ever
pbr
old
milwaukee
and
now
big
bear
now
for
its
good
points
the
label
is
one
of
the
most
awesome
out
there
with
a
big
mean
bear
it
is
a
little
cheaper
than
other
malt
liquors
at
about
a
buck
fifty
the
gravity
is
just
right
one
forty
on
a
summer
day
hanging
out
on
the
front
porch
will
put
you
right
were
you
want
to
be
its
a
classic
beverage
if
only
for
its
low
rent
appeal
not
ghetto
strictly
white
trash
i
always
get
one
when
i
visit
my
old
town
and
hang
with
my
homies
everyone
must
remember
that
this
is
malt
liquor
the
basement
bargain
brand
of
beer
it
is
what
it
is
although
this
is
one
of
the
better
tasting
malt
liquors
that
i
have
tried
it
does
not
have
the
characteristic
sweet
taste
from
the
alcohol
that
most
malts
have
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
great
on
a
warm
day
with
some
bbq
it
is
also
rdiculously
cheap
when
compared
to
other
malts
not
bad
not
bad
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
packs
a
punch
not
overly
sweet
like
most
malt
liquors
tastes
the
best
when
drank
ice
cold
right
out
of
the
bottle
for
a
nice
99
cent
buzz
you
cant
beat
it
oh
yeah
and
the
bears
nice
to
look
at
this
40
does
what
it
sets
out
to
do
gets
ya
drunk
cheap
and
lets
you
do
it
before
it
gets
warm
if
thats
your
objective
better
than
most
40
ozs
of
malt
liquor
ive
tried
bad
beer
but
cheap
drinkability
depends
on
your
mindset
you
wanna
get
tanked
this
is
wonderful
drinkability
is
a
five
sit
back
and
guzzle
and
hoot
and
holler
aside
from
that
though
this
is
not
the
beer
to
be
sitting
around
with
enjoying
with
friends
there
is
nothing
to
enjoy
it
has
very
little
redeeming
qualities
except
it
might
actually
strengthen
your
face
muscles
as
i
recoiled
and
scrunched
my
face
up
after
every
sip
ah
well
a
good
choice
for
those
who
like
to
get
bombed
cheaply
cheap
drunk
if
thats
what
you
are
looking
for
but
still
kinda
sad
if
you
are
thanks
colt
45
for
taking
me
back
down
memory
lane
sort
of
you
arent
half
bad
but
you
got
a
long
way
to
go
son
well
its
better
than
natty
daddy
and
it
only
got
better
once
i
added
some
oj
from
what
i
take
out
of
colt
45
double
malt
it
pours
a
nice
soapy
head
in
my
mug
good
2
finger
head
that
goes
down
pretty
quick
the
smell
is
kinda
appealing
like
a
adjunct
lager
smell
or
hell
a
regular
colt
45
the
tastemouthfeel
is
bold
easy
drinking
and
very
carbonated
i
think
it
has
a
rich
full
body
feel
and
very
easy
drinkable
for
a
malt
liquor
the
beer
smells
like
pee
honestly
with
a
hint
of
staleness
and
saltiness
but
tasting
it
is
ok
its
a
bland
mouthfeel
with
bland
carbonation
that
could
honestly
be
heaver
i
expected
a
sweeter
taste
than
reg
colt
45
due
to
its
double
name
i
expected
a
sweet
malt
corn
flavor
instead
just
got
the
usual
corn
with
a
heavy
alcohol
taste
okay
ill
buy
a
day
of
swill
beforehand
but
i
like
this
beer
i
got
a
finger
of
rocky
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
off
of
my
pour
color
was
liquid
sunshine
in
a
glass
nose
was
full
of
adjuncts
but
as
the
grateful
dead
sang
sort
of
scents
all
empty
but
i
dont
care
am
i
allowed
to
cop
to
my
first
sexual
experience
with
a
deadhead
cougar
in
1983
i
still
dig
the
unshaven
eurostyle
cuties
finish
was
smoooth
yum
of
all
of
the
blst
no
acronyms
this
afternoon
this
was
decent
o
i
have
long
considered
the
standard
colt
45
to
be
one
of
the
best
commercially
available
malt
liquors
out
there
but
this
variation
is
interesting
less
sweet
and
carbonated
than
its
brother
but
as
i
think
the
name
is
trying
to
suggest
possesses
some
actual
malted
barley
flavor
carbonation
was
disappointing
in
my
poured
sample
but
afterwards
i
took
a
drink
directly
from
the
bottle
and
that
luscious
high
carbonation
was
there
a
good
option
for
the
style
overall
well
it
looked
fairly
decent
and
when
it
is
cold
it
drinks
rather
easy
and
crisp
once
it
warms
up
some
however
it
is
not
quite
as
easy
drinking
even
so
when
warmer
it
is
still
a
step
above
other
malts
as
it
doesnt
leave
a
real
offensive
taste
on
the
tongue
not
bad
will
drink
again
overall
including
the
slight
buzz
it
gives
i
present
double
malt
with
a
9
510
for
being
amazing
and
providing
a
benchmark
for
cheap
mls
it
will
get
you
feeling
good
rjt
colt
45
was
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
it
would
be
the
brew
poured
a
decent
colour
for
a
lager
and
the
smell
was
neutral
enough
when
it
was
cold
the
taste
was
comparable
to
a
shitty
craft
brew
or
a
regular
lame
pils
really
not
bad
compared
to
shit
like
icehouse
or
olde
english
poured
from
a
clear
40
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
very
malty
taste
is
crisp
malty
but
not
as
much
as
it
smelled
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
fairly
easily
overall
as
far
as
malt
liqours
go
this
one
aint
bad
its
very
similar
to
the
original
colt
45
but
the
double
malt
does
make
it
taste
much
maltier
its
color
is
darker
than
straw
yellow
and
has
a
bleachedwhite
head
the
alcohol
creeps
up
on
you
but
wont
give
you
the
spins
not
a
bad
beer
if
youre
completely
broke
and
are
looking
to
get
hammered
keep
in
mind
im
reviewing
this
as
per
the
style
this
is
a
damned
good
malt
ive
had
a
40
or
two
of
it
in
the
past
and
always
enjoyed
it
having
seen
this
replace
crazy
stallion
at
my
local
bodega
i
was
excited
to
give
it
another
solid
try
i
picked
up
three
16oz
cans
and
i
am
glad
i
did
crisp
clean
taste
just
the
sort
of
shit
youre
looking
for
when
buying
malt
tallboys
after
a
days
labor
im
not
sure
the
double
malt
gimmick
means
anything
at
all
but
this
stuff
is
definitely
cleanertasting
than
regular
colt
45
if
you
see
it
buy
it
need
i
say
any
more
actually
i
think
this
is
going
down
the
drain
because
i
can
sense
a
hangover
already
didnt
pour
it
just
sipped
on
it
it
is
a
very
sterilizedlooking
yellow
color
and
smells
of
alcohol
and
cheerios
doubling
the
malt
makes
this
a
rather
thick
brew
for
good
or
worse
it
is
a
great
bargain
for
2
for
not
that
bad
of
an
experience
i
must
admit
i
purchased
this
colt
45
product
because
it
proclaimed
double
malt
palate
of
sweet
malt
not
much
hops
and
goes
down
faster
than
you
can
think
as
if
anyone
could
think
much
of
anything
after
one
40oz
bottle
of
this
stuff
aroma

overall

to

you
rock
keep
making
good
high
gravity
beer
last
year
i
spent
75
on
my
rare
yes
it
was
good
but
im
sure
was
much
better
fresh
spending
that
75
was
just
fucking
stupid
and
a
complete
waste
of
money
this
proves
beer
doesnt
have
to
be
expensive
or
craft
just
has
to
be
good
this
is
beer
advocate
not
craft
beer
advocate
after
all
anyhow
this
beer
while
not
a
gem
of
the
brewing
art
does
indeed
possess
the
normal
characteristics
that
any
sane
person
would
regard
as
those
of
beer
no
matter
how
low
the
perceived
cultural
associations
i
drink
a
lot
and
have
drunk
everything
and
this
stuff
is
absolutely
the
best
period
is
it
bad
not
really
wouldnt
seek
it
out
and
i
think
there
are
better
tasting
budget
options
out
there
like
hurricane
and
natty
daddy
d
really
overall
its
just
too
alcoholic
for
my
preference
for
beer
i
dont
mind
the
alcohol
taste
at
all
but
its
almost
just
that
and
no
beer
aspects
whatsoever
there
is
no
skunkiness
or
fowl
aromas
or
tastes
to
it
but
its
just
too
unbalanced
for
me
the
feel
is
light
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
low
overall
this
serves
a
purpose
but
not
really
much
of
one
for
me
not
to
mention
one
can
got
me
totally
drunk
good
stuff
in
that
regard
golden
beer
with
a
thick
foamy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
smells
very
sweet
and
of
fermented
fruit
tangy
fermented
fruit
flavor
as
well
with
some
burnt
grain
aftertaste
pretty
drinkable
for
a
malt
liquor
especially
a
higher
abv
variety
no
musty
offensive
flavors
present
for
the
most
part
the
best
you
can
say
about
a
malt
liquor
is
if
its
close
to
a
traditional
beer
taste
and
feel
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
malt
liquor
is
a
high
mark
in
other
words
well
this
comes
oddly
close
to
not
tasting
like
a
malt
liquor
high
gravity
colt
is
within
inches
of
bumping
sr
off
its
throne
o
better
then
expected
did
not
expect
much
for
only
paying
1
50
for
a
24oz
can
overall
impression
this
is
a
solid
gooddrinking
malt
liquor
at
8
5
and
way
better
than
i
was
expecting
for
1
99
a
can
i
have
a
new
goto
boozer
has
the
mighty
211
met
its
match
flows
down
smooth
could
drink
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
but
there
are
better
cheap
macros
too
bad
they
dont
make
40s
of
these
as
a
40
could
make
you
feel
good
quick
beer
9
during
swill
tour
2010
somehow
this
one
came
out
rather
short
and
tothepoint
it
looks
just
as
pale
yellow
as
pretty
much
everything
else
today
with
the
same
kind
of
add
froth
on
top
the
nose
is
soapy
with
a
hint
of
burning
flowers
the
taste
is
of
calcified
rice
syrup
the
body
is
overtly
light
with
a
hint
of
heft
a
light
carbonation
and
a
sweetly
stale
feel
nothing
else
to
say
for
something
so
crappy
the
appearance
is
of
a
golden
clear
color
with
a
light
lacy
head
the
aroma
is
of
not
much
other
than
a
slight
corn
syrup
and
malty
sugar
on
the
back
the
taste
is
of
alcohol
most
prominently
the
flavors
are
of
corn
syrup
and
indigestion
caused
by
the
thick
alcohol
there
is
almost
an
effervescent
flavor
that
is
countered
by
the
extreme
syrup
flavor
this
shouldnt
have
a
medium
body
but
it
does
the
drinkability
is
lacking
i
dont
like
this
at
all
some
malt
liquors
are
drinkable
this
one
not
so
much
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
mild
malts
and
alcohol
taste
is
alcohol
with
some
hints
of
malts
not
terrible
but
a
tad
unpleasant
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
is
slightly
below
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
from
the
710
ml
can
marked
oct0410d07021828
sampled
on
aug
23
2010
it
pours
a
bright
pale
yellow
with
a
good
inch
of
fizzy
white
head
that
stays
around
for
the
entire
time
along
with
decent
lacing
on
the
glass
malts
corn
and
other
adjuncts
greet
the
nose
with
dare
i
say
it
a
thin
hoppiness
around
the
edges
the
taste
is
mainly
grains
and
malts
with
a
light
hoppy
bite
at
the
end
but
the
8
5
abv
is
reasonably
masked
but
your
head
reminds
you
that
it
is
there
when
all
is
said
and
done
this
is
very
much
like
any
macro
high
gravity
malt
liquor
tons
of
punch
but
little
in
the
way
of
character
or
taste
the
colt
45
beers
are
probably
the
best
adjunct
lagers
but
then
again
only
if
your
in
a
pinch
would
i
recommend
this
drinkability
is
high
until
the
abv
hits
you
at
1
29
for
24
oz
you
dont
have
to
stop
until
it
makes
you
i
dont
think
colt
45
high
gravity
is
close
to
overthrowing
hurricane
high
gravity
as
the
king
of
high
gravities
but
it
deserves
an
honorable
mention
especially
at
8
5
d
good
i
wouldnt
buy
all
the
time
but
its
def
something
to
try
if
you
havent
already
one
of
the
better
high
gravitys
on
the
market
rjt
i
had
about
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
and
while
i
was
typing
the
proceeding
it
evaporated
whoops
color
was
a
beautiful
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
slightly
fusel
but
not
overwhelming
this
was
actually
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
taste
of
berries
sugar
and
simple
starch
carbohydrates
think
licking
a
raw
potato
not
my
favorite
set
of
flavors
in
combination
especially
where
beer
is
concerned
but
deadly
or
drain
pourlike
hardly
this
will
get
its
users
where
they
are
going
but
with
minimal
damage
incurred
on
the
trip
just
dont
drive
andor
operate
heavy
machinery
afterward
babies
youll
be
fine
trust
the
monk
finish
dry
like
the
zephyr
winds
blowing
across
the
sahara
that
is
what
happens
when
you
suck
all
of
the
sugar
away
boo
hoo
you
want
sweet
drink
some
white
wine
this
is
unapologetic
and
so
am
i
exquisite
offering
get
it
now
while
you
can
probably
the
next
big
brew
once
people
catch
on
as
much
as
you
hear
about
colt
45
this
hg
masterpiece
somehow
flew
under
the
radar
the
fabled
story
of
hg
malt
liquor
continues
to
prove
they
are
better
than
their
counterparts
pours
a
glowing
golden
with
a
gloriously
thick
white
head
that
left
fair
lacing
smells
of
grain
mostly
with
a
bit
of
honey
sweetness
the
taste
is
grainy
malts
and
plastic
the
plastic
carries
through
into
the
finish
alongside
some
cookielike
malt
feels
fairly
normal
with
the
typical
higher
carbonation
not
a
bad
malt
liquor
actually
d
this
is
one
of
the
best
malt
liquors
out
there
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
terrible
considering
the
regular
colt
45
but
i
found
this
to
be
quite
decent
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
a
bit
of
alchol
peaks
out
in
the
mouth
the
beer
isnt
bad
for
what
it
is
no
gag
inducing
flavors
noted
this
is
an
ok
buzz
beer
clear
pale
golden
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
smell
is
creamed
corn
and
trace
floral
hops
green
apple
skin
sweet
grits
and
untoasted
grain
with
a
touch
of
grain
alcohol
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
super
carbonated
this
is
not
bad
for
the
style
but
not
really
good
either
good
bang
for
the
buck
if
you
want
a
cheap
and
drinkable
high
octane
beer
d
a
little
flavorful
for
the
style
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
overall
it
might
not
be
pretty
bad
but
within
the
context
of
what
this
beer
is
meant
for
it
could
be
considered
fairly
good
the
regular
colt
45
might
taste
a
little
better
but
thats
the
price
you
pay
for
high
gravity
actually
tolerable
if
you
drink
it
really
cold
but
lets
not
kid
ourselves
this
is
hooch
suitable
for
college
students
and
professional
alcoholics
my
only
advice
is
drink
it
cold
drink
it
fast
wow
a
blast
from
my
teenage
years
in
florida
i
bought
this
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
tracks
at
a
gas
station
in
southern
virginia
when
i
cracked
this
quart
bottle
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
skunky
aroma
the
flavor
was
traditional
ghetto
malt
liquor
which
i
grew
up
on
with
that
said
the
brew
was
ok
but
lacked
carbonation
to
match
the
flavor
not
completely
horrible
but
you
get
what
you
expected
with
this
beer
a
cheap
buzz
with
little
complexity
could
be
way
worse
but
at
2
bucks
this
swill
is
actually
drinkable
its
not
a
cloying
malt
bomb
like
mickeys
think
of
it
as
a
palate
cleanser
very
malty
taste
taste
almost
like
a
soggy
paper
bag
or
cherrios
i
miss
this
brew
one
of
my
favorite
40
oz
s
great
memories
of
being
21
and
reckless
this
has
been
hard
to
find
in
northern
cali
but
a
must
try
much
more
pleasant
than
the
traditional
40
oz
out
there
what
can
you
say
if
you
have
1
39
and
want
to
catch
a
buzz
you
can
it
is
strong
and
nasty
at
best
i
once
slammed
1
1240oz
and
was
wrecked
laying
on
across
train
tracks
its
nasty
tasting
very
watery
flavour
it
gave
me
a
hang
over
the
next
day
the
beer
does
not
stay
cold
on
top
of
it
cheap
moderately
harsh
and
associated
with
certain
reviled
demographics
this
is
everything
i
seek
in
a
beer
livin
high
with
country
club
pouring
a
pale
yellow
with
plenty
of
carbonation
it
comes
out
of
the
can
the
same
way
it
comes
out
of
me
the
aroma
is
of
a
fine
industrial
quality
i
take
a
draught
and
immediately
notice
that
unnamed
cryptic
harshness
of
mysterious
origins
common
to
all
malt
liquors
not
much
else
hits
me
are
hops
used
in
this
i
dont
know
are
lawn
trimmings
used
in
this
not
sure
but
if
so
they
are
used
stingily
so
as
not
to
impart
much
flavor
as
i
swirl
it
around
in
my
facial
beer
receptacle
pondering
on
the
vagaries
of
brewing
this
fine
beverage
i
wonder
if
i
am
tasting
a
faint
hint
of
malt
but
malted
what
can
sorrow
be
malted
perhaps
not
perhaps
it
was
just
my
imagination
but
the
harshness
returns
in
the
finish
that
much
i
am
not
imagining
ahh
good
stuff
but
seriously
if
the
alternative
is
leffe
blonde
or
some
such
rotten
skunk
i
will
happily
drink
country
club
all
day
the
taste
is
malt
forward
but
not
sharp
or
biting
like
so
many
malt
liquors
can
be
it
does
not
make
me
grit
my
teeth
when
i
drink
it
actually
it
is
smooth
and
on
the
sweet
side
not
really
dry
at
the
end
but
a
vague
lingering
bitterness
i
find
it
to
be
a
decent
malt
liquor
and
nowhere
near
as
gutclearing
as
others
i
have
had
hmmm
not
bad
clean
and
fairly
crisp
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
most
malt
liquors
and
there
is
actually
a
little
bit
of
dryness
on
the
finish
its
on
the
low
side
abvwise
and
that
probably
is
why
it
feels
lighter
than
most
of
this
style
i
actually
prefer
mine
in
the
67
range
otherwise
i
just
feel
like
i
might
as
well
be
drinking
a
coors
but
i
must
say
that
of
all
the
malt
liquors
i
have
had
this
one
tastes
the
lightest
most
crisp
and
is
probably
the
least
offensive
dare
i
say
that
i
wont
have
much
trouble
finishing
the
bottle
something
about
drinking
out
of
a
40
oz
bottle
soothes
the
soul
o
not
sure
where
to
place
this
on
the
scale
of
the
style
certainly
not
the
best
maybe
not
the
most
offensive
but
i
cant
think
of
an
example
thats
rougher
at
the
moment
carbonation
is
too
thin
and
not
nearly
sweet
enough
to
coverup
the
rough
alcohol
taste
that
is
evermore
apparent
as
it
warms
up
o
well
it
is
a
typical
american
malt
liquor
which
is
to
say
that
this
beer
was
probably
never
intended
to
be
all
that
great
compared
to
other
examples
of
the
style
its
not
absolutely
wretched
but
it
is
extremely
close
actually
scratch
that
its
wretched
wasnt
bad
to
have
before
lunch
poured
a
tad
of
it
out
for
macho
man
who
died
the
day
before
o
its
a
malt
not
great
not
terrible
its
cheap
and
efficient
have
one
its
fairly
rare
but
there
is
much
better
things
out
there
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
corn
and
malts
taste
is
like
the
smell
malts
with
some
corn
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
not
bad
as
far
as
malt
liquors
go
md
mouthfeel
worked
until
the
alcohol
burn
hit
blech
drinkability
you
have
to
be
kidding
if
you
want
to
imagine
popov
vodka
and
bad
beer
thats
how
drinkable
it
is
the
pour
produced
two
rocky
bonewhite
fingers
worth
of
head
that
fell
like
yesterdays
snow
but
actually
left
some
lacing
in
its
wake
color
was
a
golden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
really
left
something
to
be
desired
it
was
at
once
metallic
fusel
grapey
cereal
sweet
like
the
worst
of
everything
blended
together
into
a
hot
mess
yow
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
the
taste
was
not
as
unpleasant
as
the
nose
led
me
to
expect
it
was
sweet
sure
but
the
alcohol
was
not
up
front
making
it
bearable
finish
was
also
slightly
sweet
but
not
unbearable
i
was
left
bemused
by
the
whole
thing
if
this
is
what
i
missed
out
on
in
my
youth
i
did
not
miss
much
an
interesting
buy
but
ill
stick
to
oe
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
40
drinkabilityfinal
thoughts
in
a
way
this
malt
was
very
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavors
and
aroma
quickly
get
old
if
not
sickening
as
they
did
with
me
to
me
it
tasted
like
a
really
bad
american
adjunct
lager
and
there
wasnt
even
any
classic
malt
liquor
flavors
i
enjoy
malt
liquor
but
this
was
just
tiring
to
me
way
to
corny
i
dont
recommend
this
malt
at
all
if
your
looking
for
something
easy
to
drink
and
with
a
lower
abv
than
id
say
go
with
mickeys
or
king
cobra
just
not
this
stuff
not
a
fan
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
light
body
the
carbonation
is
high
the
drinkability
is
ok
as
long
as
the
beer
is
ice
cold
and
drank
fast
ultimately
a
tolerable
beer
if
you
like
most
icebeers
i
was
able
to
finish
the
foudy
but
barely
the
taste
is
much
better
similar
to
a
pleasant
basic
pale
lager
but
with
good
sweetbitter
balance
decent
fullness
wellrounded
grain
a
faint
nuty
hint
and
a
light
crisp
spicey
finish
of
apple
cider
with
a
light
alcoholic
warmth
and
spice
its
light
and
smooth
but
still
tasty
and
interesting
without
being
unpleasant
cool
name
and
thats
about
it
drinkability
here
is
a
bit
above
average
in
the
event
that
i
ever
want
a
cheap
and
seriously
its
only
a
damn
dollar
malt
beverage
this
is
a
viable
option
ill
probably
get
a
few
more
d
for
what
it
is
not
too
bad
had
not
drank
a
40
in
a
long
time
i
did
feel
dirty
buying
it
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
got
carded
in
a
while
d
reviews
done
the
remainders
going
down
the
drain
unless
aerozeppl
wants
to
finish
it
abv
is
unknown
but
sucking
down
40
ounces
of
this
beer
in
15
minutes
or
less
gets
you
nice
i
remember
this
brew
had
a
toosweet
taste
compared
to
the
macrobrews
of
the
time
but
was
satifying
on
a
hot
day
as
long
as
it
remained
cold
d
i
probably
will
not
buy
this
again
i
might
drink
a
glass
if
someone
had
some
that
was
cold
this
gave
me
a
headache
even
for
noveltys
sake
i
wont
be
drinking
this
again
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
if
you
wanted
to
mouthfeel
is
like
water
and
there
is
simply
nothing
to
like
about
this
i
simply
amazed
at
how
many
good
ratings
this
swill
gets
but
many
of
them
seem
to
be
drinking
it
from
the
can
so
maybe
that
is
better
i
supposed
if
you
chill
it
down
to
33
degrees
so
the
flavor
is
mostly
lost
you
could
choke
this
down
but
to
me
this
is
one
of
the
poorest
beers
on
the
market
good
for
nothing
but
a
cheap
drunk
this
may
be
the
lowest
rating
i
have
ever
given
can
you
get
a
bad
bottle
of
a
bad
beer
there
must
be
some
reason
why
my
rating
is
so
low
compared
to
everyone
else
but
enough
history
and
value
considerations
onto
the
beer
i
chose
a
single
cold
12oz
can
for
this
review
unlike
some
other
malt
liquors
the
club
is
best
in
the
can
you
want
it
to
be
cold
very
cold
while
you
drink
it
and
i
find
the
cans
have
a
crisper
taste
has
a
sort
of
strange
corny
medichemical
stale
beer
smell
im
finding
this
sample
to
be
not
nearly
cold
enough
as
sour
off
flavors
invade
immediately
as
it
cools
at
this
point
one
must
go
for
broke
and
pound
the
fucker
it
aint
going
to
get
any
better
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
too
fizzy
and
scalds
the
throat
like
most
lowerend
malt
liquors
yes
there
is
a
lower
end
to
the
lower
end
of
this
beverage
we
call
beer
tastes
like
cheap
folks
presentation
packaged
in
a
forty
ounce
clear
glass
bottle
with
a
screwtop
crown
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
it
sure
left
a
good
headache
though
overallby
far
the
best
malt
liquor
ive
had
even
better
than
colt
45
tastes
like
a
normal
lager
but
higher
alcohol
and
insanely
poundable
dont
drink
too
many
of
these
but
at
least
ive
finally
found
a
decent
malt
liquor
more
drinkable
than
you
would
think
flavor
is
mild
and
the
adjunct
flavors
subdued
this
is
no
good
german
lager
but
it
is
better
than
a
budweiser
flavor
wise
if
you
want
to
try
this
brew
definately
get
the
cans
the
clear
bottle
version
will
be
skunked
like
crazy
this
has
got
to
be
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
had
it
poured
a
straw
color
yellow
with
a
small
fizzy
white
head
that
lasted
a
couple
seconds
and
left
no
lace
the
smell
was
just
nasty
and
was
100
adjunct
with
a
hint
of
alchohol
the
flavor
was
about
the
same
and
was
tollerable
when
it
was
super
cold
but
once
it
warmed
up
it
lost
all
hope
this
is
a
beer
to
avoid
for
sure
go
with
mickeys
or
icehouse
if
you
must
get
a
beer
like
this
this
is
one
cheap
brew
that
shames
the
big
macro
types
ie
bud
coors
and
miller
its
just
another
good
product
pumped
out
by
the
guys
and
gals
at
pbr
since
this
is
country
club
i
guess
this
is
what
the
rich
folk
drink
a
brilliant
golden
body
sparkles
with
hundreds
of
fastrising
tiny
bubbles
its
frothy
brightwhite
head
holds
surprisingly
well
for
the
style
and
it
maintains
a
thin
but
solid
cap
of
creamy
foam
throughout
the
entire
serving
surprisingly
for
a
malt
liquor
it
also
leaves
some
sheets
of
lace
that
stand
a
halfinch
or
so
above
the
level
of
the
beer
as
it
drops
with
each
sip
the
nose
is
limited
offering
only
alcohol
over
a
note
of
sweet
malt
the
body
is
medium
and
its
gently
crisp
in
the
mouth
not
unlike
the
aroma
the
flavor
delivers
a
dull
semidry
malt
that
expresses
very
little
grain
flavor
and
a
noticeable
amount
of
alcohol
still
its
well
balanced
by
an
underlying
bitterness
and
its
not
as
sickly
sweet
as
some
examples
of
the
style
tend
to
be
it
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
just
a
mild
note
of
residual
lightly
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
fruitiness
thats
not
really
noticeable
while
in
the
mouth
and
a
gentle
wash
of
drying
alcohol
wellbalanced
and
clean
but
id
expect
a
little
more
character
in
a
beer
that
displays
its
alcohol
content
so
readily
overall
not
too
bad
if
i
had
to
pick
a
40
id
choose
colt
45
over
this
im
not
sure
of
the
abv
but
my
head
was
slightly
humming
about
halfway
through
the
bottle
i
gave
the
other
half
to
my
bro
cheap
but
ok
better
than
most
malt
liquors
final
grade
2
11
a
disappointing
d
i
only
know
one
person
who
drinks
this
stuff
and
its
definitely
not
because
of
the
nuanced
flavour
labatt
maximum
ice
is
good
for
precisely
one
thing
getting
shitfaced
on
beer
while
spending
as
little
money
as
possible
if
youre
not
an
alcoholic
homeless
person
i
cant
think
of
any
compelling
reasons
to
bother
with
this
one
for
the
record
i
did
manage
to
finish
the
can
but
i
wont
be
picking
up
another
in
the
future
this
beer
has
one
purpose
to
get
you
drunk
fast
it
does
what
malt
liquors
do
best
and
that
is
to
get
one
drunk
not
a
craft
but
it
is
brewed
with
natural
ingredients
and
that
to
me
means
something
dont
flunk
it
simply
because
it
is
a
macro
malt
liquor
o
it
is
a
little
less
flavorful
not
that
this
is
a
flavorful
style
of
beer
than
other
malt
liquors
the
dry
finish
is
also
unlike
any
malt
liquors
that
i
have
had
the
privilege
of
sampling
i
would
have
to
say
this
is
not
a
favorite
in
the
style
labatt
max
ice
25
ive
had
worse
but
still
this
is
pretty
awful
maybe
worth
trying
just
once
to
say
you
did
overall
in
many
ways
a
very
standard
malt
a
little
less
boozy
tasting
with
a
bit
more
caramel
instead
of
corn
then
the
most
its
not
too
bad
for
the
price
or
the
bang
it
gives
i
picked
up
a
24oz
can
of
this
at
woodmans
in
janesville
wi
in
summer
2012
i
figured
you
got
to
know
what
the
cheap
beer
tastes
like
to
know
what
to
good
beer
tastes
like
right
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
pillowy
head
has
a
strong
grassy
grain
scent
taste
is
a
sweet
grainy
taste
that
is
mildly
malty
as
well
texture
is
average
but
it
does
have
decent
drinkability
i
was
really
surprised
how
decent
this
actually
was
for
a
cheap
ice
beer
i
would
pick
this
over
millerbud
any
day
as
a
side
note
the
7
0
abv
does
give
you
a
headache
in
the
morning
but
i
blame
that
on
how
fast
i
drank
it
the
flavor
and
smell
worsen
as
it
warms
up
so
its
basically
a
double
edged
sword
overall
i
figured
how
bad
can
it
be
the
answer
is
pretty
bad
the
taste
is
awful
and
this
is
something
that
will
never
drink
again
disappointing
labatt
needs
to
go
back
to
the
budget
beer
drawing
board
recommend
serving
ice
cold
and
with
water
on
the
side
as
with
all
malt
liquors
24
oz
can
says
its
brewed
in
rochester
ny
maybe
at
genesee
weighs
in
as
a
big
american
lager
or
a
small
malt
liquor
pours
a
deep
yellow
golden
almost
apple
juice
like
tone
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
and
dwindling
even
quicker
thin
speckled
lacing
left
behind
lets
see
how
the
rest
goes
aroma
has
a
strong
cooked
veggies
high
adjunct
ridden
nose
going
on
not
much
sweetness
or
malt
or
hop
action
served
cold
to
protect
my
palate
flavor
has
a
dominant
sweetness
almost
table
sugar
extreme
sweetness
pretty
much
sickeningly
corn
syrup
high
fructose
that
should
have
been
fermented
out
not
to
hot
with
alcohol
just
one
rough
sip
that
seems
to
never
get
better
as
you
try
to
actually
consume
this
creation
absolutely
horrible
example
of
beer
in
general
but
the
sad
part
is
i
cant
even
consider
it
to
be
a
good
malt
liquor
many
a
better
cheap
drunks
out
there
pass
on
this
one
it
was
like
a
dollar
with
some
change
for
this
big
can
mouthfeel
is
harsh
i
dont
know
why
but
its
hard
to
take
a
sip
excessive
co2
medium
to
light
body
becomes
cloying
quickly
after
taking
a
few
sips
overall
pure
shite
that
really
should
avoid
the
beer
market
why
is
there
a
need
for
this
stuff
rjt
overall
not
even
a
good
beer
to
get
plastered
with
even
hurricane
malt
liquor
has
more
redeeming
qualities
than
this
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
but
definitely
not
the
best
o
thumbs
up
for
the
malt
liquor
above
average
although
certainly
not
above
rest
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
the
trade

a
24

some

nothing
special
here

overall
there
is
nothing
to
seperate
this
malt
liquor
from
the
pack
fair
drinkabilty
very
easy
to
chug
this
i
think
but
still
not
at
all
impressed

with

cloyingly
sweet

nearly
no
bitterness
boozy
finish
a
bit
metallic
in
the

significant
warmth

not

medium
bodied
and
dry
fizzy
not
an
appealing
texture
im
not
a
fan
even
for
the
style
this
is
the
worst
beer
i
ever
tasted
by
labatt
when
pouring
it
into
a
glass
and
it
had
a
nice
large
white
head
that
had
good
lacing
but
not
as
good
retention
i
was
not
impressed
with
the
smell
of
rotting
cereal
or
rice
that
got
spoiled
when
tasting
it
all
i
could
taste
was
spoiled
corn
and
thought
i
was
drinking
urine
the
mouthfeel
was
a
watered
down
poor
excuse
of
a
beer
felt
like
something
spoiled
and
smelly
was
in
my
mouth
i
know
this
has
7
1
abv
but
if
someone
wants
a
beer
just
for
getting
drunk
with
a
high
alcohol
content
id
say
go
with
steel
reserve
or
even
nat
ice
would
be
better
than
this
i
paid
1
59
for
this
can
and
i
dont
think
ill
be
able
to
finish
it
the
dozenth
entry
into
swill
fest
2010s
guestbook
it
pours
a
familiarly
clear
jaundice
topped
by
nearly
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
dirty
rice
real
dirt
not
the
style
of
rice
mix
known
as
dirty
bad
wheat
and
light
syrup
the
taste
is
kinda
heavy
on
the
corn
syrup
while
the
burnt
wheat
brings
up
the
rear
the
body
is
a
heavyish
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
steely
finish
not
the
worst
thing
consumed
tonight
but
definitely
not
the
best
either
the
appearance
is
the
golden
i
would
assume
the
malt
liquor
should
be
but
it
is
still
scary
to
me
the
smell
is
of
the
corn
and
rice
that
you
would
expect
but
there
is
a
funkiness
that
i
cant
place
i
blame
canada
the
taste
is
much
more
bitter
than
i
would
have
liked
the
other
flavors
of
it
include
many
things
that
you
would
have
experienced
in
the
aroma
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
is
canadian
ghetto
juice
this
isnt
very
good
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
i
would
have
expected
corn
syrupy
and
unpleasant
this
is
drinkable
if
you
are
sitting
on
the
curb
outside
the
liquor
store
in
toronto
thats
pretty
much
it
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
for
chugging
the
alcohol
isnt
exactly
rocket
fuel
but
aint
pleasant
as
far
as
drinkability
you
got
to
be
kidding
not
to
be
repeated
unless
you
are
broke
and
desperate
not
drinkable
absolute
drain
pour
once
again
these
oversized
cans
have
screwed
the
pooch
in
terms
of
the
placement
of
the
opening
it
was
far
enough
back
from
the
lip
that
short
of
a
complete
inversion
of
the
can
beer
was
guaranteed
to
run
down
the
sides
of
the
can
grrr
my
pour
gave
me
a
finger
of
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
medium
retention
color
was
a
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
the
nowinfamous
smell
of
green
apples
and
plastics
what
more
could
i
ask
for
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
sweetish
applecereal
quality
on
the
tongue
how
do
they
make
this
the
finish
was
really
biting
with
an
alcohol
heat
in
the
throat
this
is
not
the
way
to
go
on
a
holiday
weekend
congratulations
to
the
canadians
for
taking
the
malt
likkapalooza
xiii
title
labatt
max
ice
did
just
enough
to
pull
ahead
of
tundra
ice
and
stay
there
is
it
worth
your
hardearned
money
no
but
then
your
already
knew
that
d
not
terrible
but
there
are
better
malt
liquors
out
there
i
feel
like
most
mls
over
6
get
terrible
generally
the
high
proof
mls
are
more
expensive
so
just
spend
the
extra
50
cents
and
get
two
regular
crappy
beers
instead
of
one
extra
strong
extra
crappy
one
tastes
pretty
bad
stale
corn
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
are
pretty
ok
actually
so
you
can
at
least
drink
it
and
get
a
nice
buzz
on
the
other
plus
is
the
price
nice
1
50
medium
good
for
the
style
more
alcohol
and
better
tasting
than
olde
english
so
id
at
least
recommend
it
over
the
good
ole
pissfoty
not
as
bad
as
i
would
have
thought
but
definitely
more
about
the
booze
than
the
other
underwhelming
ingredients
d
well
i
cant
say
its
a
good
beer
but
its
fairly
average
for
the
style
and
its
going
to
take
some
time
to
finish
this
monster
of
a
can
remember
ba
science
needs
you
sometimes
this
is
a
beast
of
a
beer
i
used
to
enjoy
a
lot
in
high
school
i
revisited
this
beer
recently
ah
the
memories
this
truly
is
one
of
the
nicest
looking
macros
ive
ever
seen
pours
out
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
active
carbonate
and
a
1
inch
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
while
and
then
receded
into
a
ring
of
lacing
truly
nice
for
a
macro
smell
on
the
other
hand
was
average
smelled
like
every
other
strong
macro
does
corny
and
boozy
ah
the
maximum
ice
that
i
see
so
commonly
in
parks
and
smashed
in
school
yards
it
does
taste
alright
honestly
for
the
abv
of
this
beer
it
tastes
like
a
stock
5
macro
goes
down
smooth
with
little
bitterness
and
little
anything
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
tho
and
overly
carbonated
i
have
to
give
this
one
a
5
for
drinkability
honestly
when
you
walk
into
a
lcbo
near
closing
time
they
will
be
sold
out
of
this
people
make
fun
but
they
will
drink
this
when
cold
this
is
a
dangerously
easy
beer
to
drink
trust
me
if
you
wanna
get
drunk
on
the
cheap
this
is
one
of
the
best
beers

use

if

then
i
guess
it
would
do
the
trick
personally
i
dont

having
to
drink
enough
to
catch
a
buzz
would
be
worth
subjecting
myself
to
the
experience
of
course
i
wouldnt
drink
this
for
pleasure
but
if
money
was
tight
i
could
make
due
with
it
my
string
of
no

remains
intact
when
im
not
paying
attention
i
can
get
it
down
without
too
much
of
a
fight
not
compelling
im
only
drinking
it
because
its
in
front
of
me
pretty
boozy
even
for
a
malt
liquor
passable
if
you
like
the
style
but
not
worth
it
if
you
drink
beer
for
flavor
notes
its
malty
to
the
max
and
it
will
get
you
loaded
quickly
and
cheaply
overall
it
is
a
passable
brew
for
some
serious
drinking
d
yeah
ummmm
i
dont
think
ill
be
picking
this
up
again
not

there
is

drinking
high

beers
has
numbed
my
taste
buds
to
alcohol
but
i
dont
taste
any
in
this
better
than
other
malt
liquors
no
aftertaste
but
overal
for
a
beer
thats
about
as
strong
as
colt
45
i
would
choose
this
as
the
better
beer
good
if
you
want
to
get
drunk
fast
not
bad
for
a
labatts
tastes
a
little
like
beer
and
other
than
that
vodka
some
signs
of
bubbles
some
taste
not
too
drinkable
but
i
could
get
through
more
than
a
sip
and
thats
a
complement
for
me
for
anything
coming
out
of
this
national
brewer
all
in
all
good
summer
drink
but
watch
your
consumption
the
brew
is
so
smooth
you
have
a
tendency
to
not
realize
how
much
youve
had
and
it
creeps
upon
you
sampled
from
a
1
18
litre
bottle
put
this
puppy
in
a
brown
paper
bag
and
it
will
be
acceptable
it
was
not
worthit
basically
if
you
want
a
balanced
controlled
malt
liquor
with
some
decent
taste
look
no
further

also

light
cereal
notes
with
adjunct
barely
noticeable
body
is
about
average
with
good
carbonation
nothing
really
special
about
that
one
and
i
cant
say
i
would
have
notice
this
was
malt
liquor
if
it
had
been
a
blind
tasting
taste

slight

typical
clear
yellow
with
a
thick
but
effervescent
white

aroma
is
malty
slightly
fruity
crisp
but
unremarkable
flavor
is
more
fruity
than
malty
somewhat
sweet
but
not
cloying
not
quite
bold
but
better
than
what
the
aroma
promises
texture
is
smooth
but
lacking
in
fizz
or
viscosity
ok
not
so
hot
but
i
am
more
of
a
stoutie
a
lager
lover
should
give
it
a
fairer
shake
and
you
know
what
ratebeer
has
it
at
a
47
and
we
all
know
ratebeer
has
loose
standards
seems
everything
is
15
to
25
higher
rated
on
ratebeer
so
i
dont
feel
bad
about
this
assessment
at
all
overall
i
feel
like
this
is
almost
a
gimmick
beer
or
whatever
but
in
the
same
sense
i
can
appreciate
it
because
ive
been
there
i
think
we
all
have
this
brings
back
memories
of
a
forgotten
mainly
due
to
blackouts
style
of
beer
but
in
a
very
tasty
effort
thanks
full
sail
for
making
this
d
a
wellexecuted
malt
liquor
not
the
best
craft
attempt
ive
had
but
a
lot
better
than
most
massproduced
offerings
would
obviously
lose
the
priceperformance
debate
but
otherwise
pretty
true
to
style

on

an

kick

this
beer
has
a
lower

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
some
odd

but
the

are
tasty
d
this
is
getting
a
ridiculously
high
rating
because
its
hands
down
the
best
american
malt
liquor
ive
ever
tried
rate
to
style
right
this
beer
is
just
amazing
and
deserves
a
great
rating
poured

light
to
medium
golden
amber
with
a
thin

with
good

slippery

aroma
dominated
by
biscuit
malt
a
hint
of
citrus
flavor
is
sweet
bready
malt
vague
fruit
esters
and
just
a
touch
of
pure
alcohol
pretty
cool
the
brewer
captured
the
essence
of
a
cheap
malt
liquor
malt
and
alcohol
but
made
it
pleasantly
drinkable
the
hint
of
pure
grain
alcohol
was
genius
and
appropriate
for
the
style
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
creaminess
much
too
nice
a
mouthfeel
for
a
malt
liquor
but
i
appreciated
it
im
not
sure
id
buy
this
as
a
goto
beer
but
for
an
attempt
to
craftize
a
classic
brown
bag
american
style
they
nailed
it
i
like
this
brewers
share
series
most
havent
knocked
my
socks
off
but
all
are
interesting
and
well
worth
trying
fail
overall
this
is
pretty
darn
solid
it
really
comes
together
after
setting
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
while
its
rare
to
get
a
quality
beer
in
a
3

in
ohio
cheers
to
full

for
that
for
whatever
reason
i
never
see
their

am
drinking

slightly
caramel
in

caramelsugar

very
dry

it

not

i
will
drink
it
22
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
winter
lager
glass
took
a
whiff
found
the
fragrance
but
not
the
skunkiness
of
mickeys
slammed
down
a
decent
swig
like
you
oughta
with
malt
liquor
and
had
a
good
experience
all
the
way
there
isnt
hardly
any
head
and
the
brew
is
a
respectable
clear
amber
no
harshness
like
the
corner
brews
like
olde
english
or
steel
reserve
its
too
bad
this
is
a
limited
release
its
great
stuff
and
just
what
you
need
for
watching
your
favorite
football
team
or
monster
movie
the
malt
body
adds
sweet
grain
and
a
drop
of
honey
very
quaffable
enjoyable
offering
that
is
both
true
to
the
style
and
not
a
mere
stab
at
ironic
selfdeprecation
nor
intended
for
those
who
might
use
it
as
a
tool
for
such
shenanigans
overall
drinkable
and
tasty
example
of
the
style
perhaps
not
awardwinning
but
hey
im
drinkin
a
malt
liquor
here
taste
has
got
to
be
the
most
quaffable
malt
liquor
i
have
ever
had
nice
little
grain
and
alcohol
very
little
hops
what
this
has
that
most
of
the
common
mls
dont
have
is
a
nice
caramel
malt
presence
and
a
fine
carbonation
as
a
beer
in
general
it
is
just
ok
but
as
a
malt
liquor
it
is
quite
good
coming
from
a
craft
brewery
though
it
just
seems
wrong
in
principle
so
i
cant
morally
give
this
beer
perfect
marks
sorry
i
just
cant
i
might
buy
it
again
depending
on
if
i
feel
like
having
a
reasonably
priced
high
abv
bomber
o
there
is
nothing
overly
special
about
the
taste
of
this
beer
but
it
is
extremely
drinkable
and
doesnt
have
any
off
flavors
or
a
taste
of
alcohol
overall
this
didnt
exactly
knock
my
socks
off
but
like
i
said
not
bad
considering
most
of
the
others
out
there
by
the
way
some
argue
that
a
malt
liquors
high
abv
ought
to
be
taken
into
account
in
its
review
i
dont
agree
there
are
plenty
of
beers
out
there
with
high
abvs
that
are
also
delicious
this
one
isnt
poured
into
a
becker
a
deep
golden
with
a
large
one
finger
white
head
that
faded
pretty
quickly
leaving
a
few
small
chunks
of
lace
behind
aromas
were
light
with
a
touch
of
sweet
booze
and
toast
malta
little
corn
came
into
play
as
the
beer
warmed
the
flavors
were
not
nearly
as
potent
and
boozy
as
i
thought
they
would
begrainy
and
lithly
toasted
with
just
a
light
zing
of
sweet
alcoholthe
cornadjunct
flavors
were
pretty
well
hidden
this
is
a
standard
for
american
malt
liquor
wich
might
not
being
saying
a
whole
lot
but
this
was
pretty
damn
good
and
easy
going
down
for
how
big
it
is
opretty
much
what
you
would
expect
from
a
malt
liquor
even
though
it
isnt
a
fancy
style
i
think
its
pretty
cool
that
full
sail
decided
to
make
one
just
something
different
okay
i
know
i
hate
malt
liquor
but
i
decided
to
try
this
anyways
for
4
it
was
worth
a
shot
poured
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
mid
sized
off
white
head
the
smells
are
of
a
sweet
malty
aroma
not
full
of
the
corn
adjuncts
which
normally
turn
me
off
to
malt
liquor
the
feel
is
medium
decent
carbonation
the
taste
is
pretty
good
better
than
the
cheap
stuff
you
get
a
sugary
load
of
malts
but
grain
which
is
nice
lots
of
sweet
barley
malts
up
front
corn
bread
touch
of
honey
spicycitrus
hops
towards
the
end
body
is
medium
crisp
a
little
dry
and
syrupy
aftertaste
nice
carbonation
alcohol
well
hiding
compared
to
a
typical
adjunct
malt
liquor
this
is
golden
but
it
doesnt
really
pop
in
any
one
direction
except
for
maybe
the
nice
full
sail
malt
profile
it
is
however
drinkable
and
worth
the
purchase
i
got
a
kick
out
of
its
charitable
contribution
choice
though
spousal
abuse
is
no
laughing
matter
o
sweet
and
uneventful
malty
for
sure
o
this
is
by
far
the
best
malt
liquor
i
have
ever
had
its
one
of
those
beers
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
if
it
was
year
round
i
got
it
for
3
bucks
and
well
worth
the
price
instead
of
giving
me
corn
water
bmc
give
me
something
like
this
at
a
cheap
price
o
really
the
least
harsh
malt
liquor
ive
had
its
8
but
never
really
feels
like
it
in
a
lot
of
ways
it
feels
like
a
big
pilsner
a
fun
beer
to
drink
and
as
long
as
full
sail
puts
out
good
interesting
sub4
bombers
im
going
to
try
them
on
the
other
hand
its
a
good
beer
its
a
good
craft
lager
the
hops
in
it
are
not
excessive
for
a
lager
and
about
as
complex
as
a
lager
ever
needs
to
be
without
going
over
the
top
its
an
excellent
alcohol
percentage
for
any
beer
in
my
opinion
its
just
an
allaround
good
lager
not
really
what
i
would
want
to
drink
when
im
in
the
mood
for
the
malt
liquor
style
though
as
the
previous
review
put
it
natty
daddy
is
better
within
style
o
i
did
not
like
this
one
at
all
i
would
rather
drink
a
natty
daddy

the
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
for
the
style
and
i
had
a
bit
of
a
dilemma
rating
the
drinkability
hey
within
the
style
high
abv
malt
liquor
this
is
super
drinkable
i
actually
talked
with
the
brewer
on
the
way
out
of
fs
he
doesnt
look
old
enough
to
drink
nice
guy
and
welcome
to
full
sail
and
i
am
looking
forward
to
your
future
brews
a
totally
crummy
beer
that
tastes
like
liquid
aluminum
and
smells
like
it
too
but
hey
it
was
99
cents
wouldnt
buy
it
again
unless
i
had
only
a
dollar
to
my
name
though
its
a
cheap
malt
liquor
pretty
much
just
a
session
beer
tastes
exactly
like
the
price
would
lead
you
to
assume
this
is
more
of
an
i
want
to
get
drunk
kind
of
beer
than
a
fancy
tasty
beer
but
at
99
cents
for
a
24
ounce
can
can
you
really
argue
with
it
hands
down
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
try
it
for
a
review
thats
about
it
o
this
is
a
pretty
tame
malt
liquor
it
is
weaker
tasting
than
most
it
goes
down
easy
and
was
a
great
way
to
celebrate
todays
holiday
o
overall
pretty
much
a
nice
big
load
of
garbage
perhap
s
slighty
above
steel
reserve
rjt
o
worth
a
try
for
the
price
and
nostalgia
if
you
remember
the
original
crazy
horse
malt
liquor
you
cant
really
go
wrong
for
the
price
although
it
is
a
completely
forgettable
beer
cheers
d
99cents
for
24oz
maybe
paid
a
bit
too
much
an
extra
50
cents
gets
you
more
flavor
and
more
abv
o
drinkability
was
a
bit
hesitant
not
very
smooth
comes
in
a
bit
subpar
per
style
harsh
astringent
feel
a
winning
combination
of
coarse
overcarbonation
and
sharp
astringent
grapeapple
flavors
this
needs
to
be
consumed
with
pretzels
or
something
to
cleanse
the
palate
immediately
the
aftertaste
is
taunting
my
gag
reflex
wet
manila
folders
grape
juice
communion
wine
watery
and
fizzy
a
flaccid
and
utterly
bland
industrial
lager
not
planning
to
finish
the
rest
of
this
the
seventh
entry
in
swillfest
2011
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
harsh
vanilla
and
cream
soda
wheat
and
corn
syrup
hoofah
indeed
the
taste
unfortunately
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
corn
syrup
is
slightly
sweeter
and
theres
a
bit
of
light
wheat
thrown
in
for
good
measure
well
good
is
a
strong
word
the
body
is
a
rather
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
dryly
syrupy
feel
overall
a
malt
lickah
that
wants
to
be
a
cream
ale
but
instead
fails
at
both
professions
this
is
pale
golden
there
is
corn
smell
on
the
nose
i
really
think
this
is
truly
a
sad
excuse
for
anything
close
to
tasting
good
the
flavor
is
pretty
terrible
lots
of
adjuncts
its
really
really
hard
to
swallow
this
beer
and
i
dont
think
that
there
is
too
many
individuals
who
would
willingly
want
this
whole
thing
for
themselves
as
much
trash
as
i
talk
about
this
beer
there
is
no
beating
the
price
at
0
99
for
a
24oz
can
it
might
even
be
cheaper
than
the

a

mild

thin

very

not

more

for
what
it
is
this
is
unbelieveably
drinkable
decent
flavor
goes
down
well
and
super
cheap
its
the
malt
liquor
trifecta
this
was
the
highlight
and
unanimous
favorite
of
my
recent
malt
liquor
tasting
one
craft
drinker
one
macro
drinker
that
can
enjoy
a
craft
and
one
just
getting
into
beer
a
rocky
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retenion
color
was
a
deep
golden
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
very
mellow
taste
i
really
enjoyed
its
smooth
unobtrusive
dance
acoss
my
tongue
the
finish
reminded
me
of
a
ceeam
ale
good
poured
from
a
can
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
reddish
hue
to
it
and
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
fairly
pleasant
a
little
sweet
i
was
looking
foward
to
my
first
sip
well
the
taste
is
not
so
good
almost
like
bitter
corn
this
beer
is
also
bitter
in
the
mouth
i
struggled
to
finish
my
24
oz
can
not
a
good
beer
at
all
pale
yellow
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
quickly
recedes
into
a
skim
smell
is
grits
and
faint
toasted
grain
tastes
sweet
upfront
with
spent
grain
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
and
not
really
a
good
malt
liquor
imo
im
guessing
the
abv
is
fairly
low
for
the
style
somewhere
in
the
56
range
more
like
a
cheap
ice
beer
than
malt
liquor
to
my
taste
buds
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
corny
aftertaste
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
far
from
the
worst
malt
liquor
ive
had
ive
had
better
malt
liquors
take
a
ride
but
dont
let
it
gallop
away
notes
i
remember
the
name
change
and
i
remember
that
bedstuy
was
upset
as
i
had
friends
there
and
when
it
was
pulled
it
did
not
go
over
well
i
was
a
young
punk
and
i
was
just
as
upset
looking
backi
realize
that
the
beer
should
have
never
existed
a
cheap
shot
and
i
would
never
think
of
buying
or
drinking
this
again
malt
liquor
tallboy

this
is
not

benders
swill
for
the
person
on
a
budget
drinkability
i
mustnt
let
the
crazy
stallion
win
i
mustnt
let
it
beat
me
but
im
afraid
im
done
for
ugh
theres
something
about
this
malt
liquor
it
isnt
too
high
in
abv
so
doesnt
taste
like
gasoline
like
other
malt
liquors
in
fact
the
taste
is
smooth
and
it
goes
down
fine
unfortunately
even
though
this
is
a
decent
40
i
was
wondering
why
they
changed
the
name
until
i
read
the
review
of
the
lawsuit
i
am
not
feeling
well
now
after
drinking
it
hurting
its
drinkability
i
havent
yet
thought
about
the
specific
numbers
much
less
added
them
up
but
my
gut
tells
me
crazy
stallion
fades
on
the
final
turn
and
loses
at
the
wire
neither
one
of
these
beers
is
all
that
wonderful
possibly
because
the
abv
isnt
high
enough
for
some
serious
malt
liquor
action
i
tend
to
like
the
no
holds
barred
versions
of
this
style
the
best
in
short
crazy
horse
could
stand
to
be
a
lot
more
crazy
from
a
40
oz
bottle
split
with
piecesofflair
pours
out
to
a
medium
orange
golden
color
with
a
spitlike
head
no
lace
i
cant
smell
anything
maybe
some
malt
i
cant
tell
taste
is
tolerable
but
far
from
enjoyable
light
sour
malt
sweet
alcohol
corn
ugh
mouthfeel
is
rather
rich
but
doesnt
make
up
for
the
poor
flavor
drinkability
is
questionable
a
decent
maltliquor
but
does
that
really
give
you
any
indication
of
how
good
it
is
pass
on
it
unless
you
must
drinkability
is
high
for
a
fouro
and
although
i
poured
this
into
a
glass
i
like
the
wide
mouth
bottle
for
future
opportunities
to
suck
down
a
bottle
out
of
the
brown
bag
oh
yeah
another
contender

2006
this
ml
poured
out
very
watery
looking
with
a
big
old
white
head
smell
was
predictably
skunky
cornwater
like
taste
was
metallic
and
sour
alcohol
laced
full
bodied
but
in
a
way
that
was
disconcerting
considering
its
a
malt
liquor
and
you
expect
those
to
be
pretty
thin
and
easy
drinking
no
more
crazy
stallion
for
me
please
drinkability
thirst
quenching
with
food
but
not
especially
tasty
or
complementary
crazy
stallion
whose
name
offends
me
way
less
than
crazy
horse
aint
too
bad
it
is
somewhat
better
in
a
bottle
but
most
recently
ive
drank
a
few
16oz
cans
of
it
it
is
one
of
the
cheapest
beers
available
ounce
for
ounce
here
in
scenic
bedstuy
its
got
a
bit
of
a
sharp
offtaste
component
to
its
basic
malt
liquor
adjunctfunk
but
nothing
to
whine
about
it
might
just
have
you
digging
in
your
couch
cushions
and
putting
your
shoes
back
on
very
carbonated
thick
and
greasy
high
alcohol
and
little
balance
makes
this
a
tough
one
to
drink
although
not
as
bad
as
anticipated
they
shouldve
called
it
wyld
stalyn
to
capitalize
on
all
that
pr
the
could
get
from
associating
themselves
with
bill
and
ted
i
also
read
somewhere
that
this
stuff
was
orignally
called
crazy
horse
and
featured
a
picture
of
a
native
american
on
the
can
but
it
was
deemed
offensive
for
some
reason
and
got
changed
to
a
horse
but
they
kept
the
hairstyle
crazy
horses
color
is
honey
golden
head
is
weak
smell
is
malty
with
an
apple
aroma
mixed
in
taste
is
malty
and
kinda
fullflavored
for
a
malt
liquor
there
really
isnt
much
to
say
here
just
that
this
is
a
little
bit
better
than
the
standard
malt
liquors
on
the
market
couldnt
drink
it
though
something
about
it
just
wouldnt
let
me
just
couldnt
bring
myself
to
down
it
above
average
for
a
malt
liquor
wow
forty
ounces
of
crazy
horse
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
joke
when
i
saw
it
and
thought
to
myself
theres
no
way
hell
that
its
any
good
the
label
reminded
me
of
the
arizona
iced
tea
bottles
and
according
to
neros
review
i
guess
they
are
the
ones
who
are
responsible
for
the
bottling
here
appears
a
golden
with
a
white
frothy
shot
lived
head
leaving
minimal
lacing
as
far
as
the
aroma
goes
its
light
but
there
are
some
nice
tones
here
sweet
grain
very
clean
subtle
floral
notes
possibly
some
hops
in
there
taste
is
very
solid
id
imagine
there
is
some
alcohol
considering
the
malt
liquor
label
but
its
probably
the
cleanest
tasting
malt
liquor
i
have
ever
tasted
sweet
rolling
flavor
some
fruit
edged
tones
in
there
and
not
a
bad
beer
simple
light
refreshing
best
of
all
no
gag
reflex
occurs
with
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
extremely
thin
no
texture
to
this
beer
even
smooth
carbonation
in
the
sense
that
its
not
too
harsh
on
the
throat
with
each
gulp
of
this
bad
boy
drinkability
for
a
college
student
like
myself
if
im
going
for
the
buzz
this
maybe
an
option
in
the
future
under
two
bucks
i
cant
complain
solid
malt
liquor
no
off
flavors
and
refreshing
plus
i
like
the
bottle
and
the
name
crazy
horse
oh
yeah

sons
the
people
that
brought
you
arizona
iced
teas
theyre
more
of
a
marketing
company
than
a
beverage
producer
so
its
interesting
that
theyd
invest
in
packaging
for
a
beer
style
thats
mainly
consumed
wrapped
in
a
brown
paper
bag
however
the
beer
pours
a
surprisingly
rich
golden
colored
body
topped
by
a
full
frothy
bright
white
head
that
holds
ok
but
eventually
drops
to
just
a
minor
collar
and
a
flat
surface
the
aroma
expresses
a
lightly
fruity
apples
and
gently
nutty
but
solid
maltiness
the
alcohol
is
only
minimally
noticeable
a
firm
body
combines
with
a
fine
and
moderate
carbonation
for
a
smooth
and
mildly
creamy
mouthfeel
the
flavor
mimics
the
aroma
lightly
fruity
with
a
clean
sweet
and
grainy
maltiness
a
strong
percentage
of
adjunct
is
clearly
used
allowing
the
beer
to
maintain
its
firm
body
but
not
be
overwhelmed
with
true
rich
malt
flavor
bittering
hops
are
barely
present
and
there
is
no
noticeable
hop
flavor
or
aroma
very
well
done
just
smooth
and
clean
sweet
malt
with
a
well
hidden
alcohol
although
it
can
build
on
you
after
20
ounces
or
so
a
surprisingly
well
done
malt
liquor
but
a
little
sweet
on
the
palate
t
tasted
much
like
the
above
but
due
to
its
high
alcohol
content
you
dont
have
much
time
to
really
analyze
its
bite
there
might
be
worse
examples
of
the
style
but
i
hope
not
this
shows
the
worst
of
the
stereotypical
malt
liquor
a
waste
of
99
cents
plus
tax
sweet
with
nail
polish
and
soap
there
are
better
more
balanced
more
flavored
malt
liquors
out
there
this
is
instaheadache
couldnt
quite
finish
the
first
half
even
with
determination
five
xs
on
the
front
of
this
can
isnt
that
the
international
label
for
poison
this
stuff
didnt
kill
me
just
made
me
wish
it
had
a
pale
yellow
with
a
frizzy
white
head
the
nose
is
especially
grainy
the
flavor
profile
is
flat
and
of
bitter
alcohol
quite
a
light
body
and
too
much
carbonation
not
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
not
a
beer
that
i
believe
i
will
be
able
to
finish
never
will
buy
again
it
pours
cloudy
and
not
for
good
reasons
this
is
just
plain
nasty
i
forced
myself
to
quaff
half
of
the
24
ounce
can
but
i
couldnt
even
stomach
the
rest
this
is
a
shitty
beer
among
shitty
beers
i
will
continue
to
pick
these
guys
up
when
i
need
a
quick
and
cheap
pick
me
up
i
bought
this
beer
at
a
liqour
store
for
2
99
for
a
four
pack
it
seems
to
have
a
warm
sensation
once
swallowed
due
to
the
high
alcohol
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
thick
never
bothered
to
pour
it
into
a
mug
though
it
smells
very
grainy
and
cheap
although
this
beer
is
one
beer
you
would
like
to
drink
if
you
just
wanted
to
get
smashed
all
in
all
for
2
99
you
pay
for
what
you
get
surprisingly
this
wasnt
horrible
but
then
again
it
wasnt
all
that
good
either
but
in
the
realm
of
reallycheap
40s
this
one
doesnt
do
too
horribly
hmm
i
just
got
a
bit
of
a
grape
taste
in
there
interesting
anyway
for
a
cheap
warm
buzz
this
one
will
do
the
trick
a
good
nominee
for
nights
out
drinking
with
the
guys
out
at
the
old
hunting
shack
so
taking
style
into
account
i
almost
give
this
lowlyraked
malt
liquor
a
thumbs
up
overall
its
certainly
not
the
worst
malt
liquor
ive
ever
had
that
award
s
been
earned
by
the
king
of
beers
with
their
hurricane
nor
is
it
the
best
id
place
it
middlin
to
middlinbottom
could
be
much
better
dont
complain
to
me
if
you
get
hammered
and
kill
your
neighbor
or
wake
up
with
the
worst
hangover
youve
ever
had
and
call
in
sick
forever
i
warned
you
oh
and
if
there
really
is
a
satan

work
at
a
distributer
that
sells
this
beer
so
i
had
to
try
it
at
first
open
i
thought
that
the
high
alcohol
smell
would
make
for
a
bad
beer
after
a
couple
sips
excluding
camo
genuine
ale
half
way
done
the
taste
is
strong
with
alcohol
and
horribly
sweet
as
if
sweetened
with
splenda
the
taste
is
definitely
not
the
high
point
of
the
beer
pretty
drunk
now
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thicker
but
sour
it
has
bad
drinkablity
i
cant
chug
it
because
it
wouldnt
give
me
enough
time
to
get
to
the
sink
there
was
maybe
3
or
4
mouthfulls
left
but
i
gotta
barf
anyway
a
horrible
beer
that
can
serve
a
purpose
if
low
on
cash
or
self
esteem

524oz
can
this
beer
poured
a
medium
creamysoapy
white
head
with
finesmall
sized
bubbles
that
quickly
diminished
the
body
was
clear
and
carbonated
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
golden
and
there
was
no
lacing
the
nose
was
that
of
alcohol
and
it
had
a
very
weird
flavor
to
it
this
beer
had
a
burning
sensation
as
it
was
swallowed
but
its
got
its
perks
the
color
was
a
reddishstraw
color
had
no
head
whatsoever
after
a
few
minutes
sure
the
head
started
out
big
and
fluffy
and
found
my
self
buying
a
case
of
twelve
24oz
cans
ive
tasted
a
lot
of
beers
in
my
time
but
this
has
to
be
among
the
worst
i
know
some
people
mentioning
a
head
but
it
had
very
little
for
me
the
smell
was
okay
but
the
taste
was
like
pure
alcohol
with
a
hint
of
apple
to
it
if
there
were
any
hops
in
it
they
must
have
floated
to
the
top
and
been
scraped
off
because
i
could
taste
none
the
only
reason
i
gave
it
more
than
a
1
0
is
because
you
could
easily
hold
your
breath
and
guzzle
the
stuff
downlittle
carbonation
or
aftertaste
skip
it
rjt
all
in
all
awful
beverage
youve
been
warned
overall
highly
recommended
make
sure
to
drink
outside
while
walking
where
people
can
see
you
this
is
a
beer
that
give
you
instant
cred
and
says
fuck
everyone
one
of
those
beers
that
was
given
to
me
as
a
gag
gift
awhile
back
sat
in
my
fridge
for
some
time
and
finally
got
opened
out
of
curiosity
the
looks
of
it
are
really
nice
actually
clear
golden
in
color
with
an
inch
of
reasonably
well
lasting
head
pure
white
and
leaving
lacing
as
i
swirl
it
the
nose
isnt
bad
either
not
at
all
slightly
stale
and
rather
sweet
barley
and
dextrose
aromas
and
some
slight
metallic
oddness
but
nothing
way
off
and
not
at
all
super
boozy
the
flavor
is
another
story
the
first
sip
is
rather
pleasant
i
surprisingly
taste
grain
first
it
gets
worse
from
their
though
the
second
sip
reveals
a
ton
of
sweetness
unnatural
and
very
dense
while
the
third
sip
shows
just
how
alcoholic
it
is
its
a
mess
and
downright
revolting
by
the
third
sip
more
can
than
beer
at
this
point
honestly
on
the
whole
its
better
than
anticipated
for
so
long
but
the
huge
can
and
huge
booze
makes
me
timid
this
would
be
warm
by
the
end
of
it
which
totally
turns
my
guts
around
carbonation
is
fine
though
the
body
is
sweet
and
big
lager
yeast
flashes
in
an
odd
appearance
and
im
wondering
why
so
much
residual
sugar
just
sloppy
technique
by
whatever
factory
produced
this
thing
serves
a
purpose
i
guess
but
not
a
purpose
i
hope
to
ever
have
6
oz
drank
18
oz
to
clean
out
the
drain
cheers
possibly
this
brew
could
also
be
utilized
as
paint
thinner
or
to
help
remove
those
stubborn
concrete
driveway
oil
stains
the
overall
rating
includes
the
sackofhammers
effect
of
the
10
5
abv
overall
after
a
few
sips
im
literally
gagging
im
dumping
this
tallboy
down
the
drain
while
its
one
of
the
most
bitter
flavors
ive
ever
had
from
a
tallboy
camo
black
ice
will
really
get
you
the
most
bang
for
your
buck
this
stuff
carries
a
serious
bite
the
initial
taste
although
strong
is
actually
not
that
horrible
it
will
however
give
your
face
an
ooglymoogly
expression
if
youre
not
accustomed
to
drinking
it
the
nice
thing
about
it
is
how
quickly
it
can
get
you
on
the
level
for
the
average
person
a
single
tallboy
will
get
you
a
healthy
buzz
and
anything
beyond
2
is
guaranteed
tipsystatus
if
you
can
get
past
the
aftertaste
this
stuff
makes
a
long
day
at
work
seem
like
less
of
a
big
deal
at
the
end
of
the
day
harshly
astringent
and
overcarbonated
it
tastes
like
alcohol
and
white
grape
juice
that
has
started
to
turn
sharp
and
lipcurling
foul
taste
of
fusel
alcohol
and
sickly
sweet
white
grape
juice
likely
from
wine
yeast
just
bad
real
bad
one
of
the
worse
malt
liquors
on
the
market
pretty
much
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
for
a
1
49
can
o
this
single
22oz
can
of
beer
will
probably
get
you
wasted
and
you
will
have
a
headache
for
a
couple
of
days
worse
is
that
you
wont
feel
right
for
a
while
its
like
the
impurities
remain
inside
your
body
and
reek
havoc
on
your
system
i
hate
this
stuff
i
sometimes
buy
it
for
people
as
a
joke
the
eighth
entry
in
swillfest
2011
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
bubblegum
vanilla
cream
soda
and
corn
syrup
boo
the
taste
holds
notes
of
lemon
rind
tart
mandarin
orange
skin
corn
syrup
and
rotten
vanilla
bean
more
boo
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
kinda
syrupy
feel
overall
a
highly
objectionable
malt
lickah
one
that
i
wish
followed
the
harshly
sweet
smell
this
is
a
pale
straw
color
that
isnt
really
appetizing
to
the
eyes
the
nose
has
some
puffed
rice
and
anise
i
really
think
this
smells
like
butthole
i
truly
dont
think
its
a
very
favorable
taste
as
well
there
is
a
lot
of
corn
syrup
and
pain
its
seriously
hard
to
get
down
overall
this
is
a
terrible
beer
nuff
said
enjoy
that
1
25
camo
youre
not
getting
another
one
from
me
drinkability
only
drink
it
to
get
drunk
for
nexttonothing
would
certainly
never
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
for
any
purpose
cheers
crisp
and
lots
of
carbonation
up
front
delves
into
a
burning
ethyl
feel
for
the
finish
it
almost
feelstastes
like
somebody
dumped
a
shot
of
shitty
whiskey
into
a
beer
o
im
glad
this
isnt
available
where
i
live
because
i
can
see
myself
buying
it
far
too
often
for
the
priceeffect
since
im
frugal
this
is
pretty
bad
and
dangerous
even
for
a
seasoned
high
gravity
malt
liquor
drinker
like
i
am
the
alcohol
in
this
can
take
you
by
surprise
of
course
once
youre
under
black
ices
influence
it
can
taste
well
acceptable
ive
had
one
other
10
5
abv
high
gravity
ice
malt
liquor
pit
bull
ice
with
the
same
abv
style
and
price
range
but
pit
bull
ice
is
completely
drinkable
camo
black
ice
is
not
the
upside
is
it
is
one
of
the
cheapest
beers
you
will
find
the
alcoholprice
is
very
decent
poured
from
a
24
oz
can
has
a
rich
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
alcohol
some
malts
taste
is
of
alcohol
and
not
good
at
all
no
real
beer
flavor
here
feels
light
with
a
slight
burn
in
the
mouth
and
is
one
of
the
least
drinkable
beers
i
have
tried
overall
this
beer
is
borderline
disgusting
d
would
rather
drink
whats
in
the
cats
litter
box
d
one
of
the
most
godawful
things
ive
put
in
my
mouth
thanks
jacob
and
jer
for
sharing
this
one
very
generous
another
great
find
of
a
beer
in
a
ghetto
liquor
store
pours
golden
with
a
slight
haze
big
bad
white
foamy
head
that
dies
down
relatively
quickly
to
a
small
cap
with
a
spot
or
two
of
lace
smells
of
honey
plastic
ammonia
and
hot
garbage
on
the
nose
tastes
of
sour
grapes
plastic
corn
drenched
in
rubbing
alcohol
and
the
finish
brings
a
bit
of
cookie
and
a
roll
of
pennies
medium
to
light
in
body
not
too
sure
because
i
cant
really
keep
it
in
my
mouth
too
long
without
discomfort
very
high
carbonation
this
is
probably
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
one
day
i
want
to
try
evil
eye
one
day
until
then
i
hate
myself
for
buying
this
even
if
it
was
just
for
a
laugh
i
think
i
have
a
headache
after
2
3
oz
now
ill
probably
never
touch
the
stuff
again
but
in
its
defense
i
have
to
say
that
it
does
what
its
intended
to
do
very
well
which
is
to
get
you
as
shitfaced
as
possible
as
quickly
and
inexpensively
as
possible
okay
is
this
beer
capable
of
getting
a
head
i
poured
repeatedly
only
to
see
what
little
developed
devolve
into
wisps
the
hell
with
it
i
moved
on
color
was
a
beautiful
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nice
especially
since
it
was
all
downhill
from
there
the
nose
had
a
sharp
paint
thinnerlike
quality
which
is
not
optimal
ok
i
am
not
stupid
i
get
the
point
it
is
a
cheap
buzz
at
10
5
abv
in
a
lowpriced
24oz
can
but
zounds
does
it
need
to
be
so
obnoxious
mouthfeel
was
thin
with
a
hot
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
replaced
with
a
green
apple
flavor
phew
the
finish
left
me
literally
breathless
it
was
a
really
hot
beer
from
start
to
finish
and
undoubtedly
smoked
a
couple
of
brain
cells
and
a
region
of
my
liver
man
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
crack
another
of
those
i
usually
dont
drink
this
stuff
but
it
is
not
below
me
and
i
did
have
a
can
of
this
the
other
day
during
some
an
intense
rockband
xbox
sesh
i
didnt
pour
it
out
but
the
can
is
pretty
tight
i
like
the
explosion
thing
and
the
military
style
font
unfortunatly
its
not
very
good
after
that
it
smells
like
cornflakes
and
alcohol
it
tastes
like
cornflakes
and
paint
thinner
mouthfeel
i
dunno
i
was
drinking
it
as
fast
as
possible
to
avoid
the
taste
drinkability
is
low
seeing
as
how
its
10
5
and
terrible
but
there
is
a
silver
lining
i
felt
pretty
awesome
immediatly
following
consumption
its
a
double
edged
sword
notes
from
31408
this
is
beyond
an
ice
brewed
malt
liquor
there
should
be
a
new
category
for
alcoholic
concoctions
such
as
this
my
god
is
this
stuff
vile
for
its
10
5
alcohol
by
volume
mark
this
beer
is
not
the
worst
i
have
ever
had
but
beware
you
must
keep
this
can
ice
cold
lest
you
drink
warm
camo
which
is
something
i
would
not
give
to
my
worst
enemy
a
24oz
can
does
me
well
and
for
the
price
its
not
bad
the
taste
is
bad
but
if
you
are
a
week
from
payday
and
need
a
beer
to
get
you
through
an
awful
royals
game
this
is
the
one
to
reach
for
not
evil
eye
just
cant
refuse
a
new
99
cent
camo
product
so
let
the
punishment
fit
the
crime
this
is
nasty
of
course
10
5
of
pure
adjunct
power
strong
sweet
aroma
terrible
nice
pour
with
a
ton
of
lacing
dark
gold
color
mouthfeel
taste
and
overall
enjoyment
are
minimal
another
ghetto
bullet
by
the
camo
family
edit
dear
god
i
had
to
pour
this
out
it
was
that
bad
i
pour
from
the
24
ounce
can
into
my
pint
glass
clear
yellow
gold
fluid
with
minimal
head
smells
like
chemicals
and
alcohol
and
earthy
grains
tastes
horrible
it
tastes
like
a
vodka
boilermaker
into
a
crappy
beer
i
guess
thats
the
best
way
i
can
describe
it
terrible
to
drink
im
choking
this
one
down
because
im
a
man
but
this
is
awful
beer
the
only
decent
thing
about
this
can
of
hellish
swill
is
that
its
10
5
abv
so
if
you
only
have
1
39
in
your
sock
thisll
do
pig
thisll
do
d
overall
this
is
a
sorry
excuse
for
a
malt
liquor
and
ice
beer
or
a
beer
for
that
matter
i
guess
if
your
only
goal
is
to
get
drunk
off
your
ass
then
you
might
like
this
if
you
actually
appreciate
beer
then
stay
away
the
appearance
score
might
put
camo
black
ice
over
the
top
when
it
comes
to
the
final
score
but
malt
liquors
are
made
for
drinking
and
yes
tasting
so
schlitz
high
gravity
is
my
favorite
beer
of
malt
likkapalooza
x
no
matter
how
it
shakes
out
in
the
end
looks
like
camo
900
high
gravity
is
the
best
camo
of
them
all
i
really
didnt
have
high
hopes
for
the
camo
black
ice
high
gravity
lager
but
i
actually
found
it
to
be
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
from
start
to
finish
its
a
malt
liquor
through
and
through
from
its
clear
pale
amber
color
to
its
mildly
dry
finish
the
smell
was
the
only
aspect
that
really
put
me
off
but
the
taste
was
much
better
than
that
it
does
a
decent
job
of
masking
its
whopping
10
5
alcohol
level
and
the
black
ice
remains
drinkable
at
a
wide
range
of
temps
youll
find
that
out
as
it
takes
a
while
to
work
your
through
a
24oz
can
one
things
for
certain
by
the
time
you
finish
one
of
these
youre
going
to
have
a
different
outlook
on
things
originally

poured
from
a
24

aroma
is
a
distinctive
amalgam
of
burning

and

clean
and
clear
in

with
a
fresh
draught
of

beautiful

flavor
departs
from
the

and
grabs
more
of
a

backed
with
incredibly
alcohol
reek
bus

and
bushels
of

you
can
really
feel
the
alcohol
working
its
evil
on
you
bitter
for
no
apparent
reason
certainly
not
hops
its
like
having
all
the
bad
parts
of
a
poorly
craft
brewed
barleywine
without
any
of
the
malt
character
or
hop
flavor
pure
concentrated
corn
sugar
garbage
smacks
out
in

figure
camo
black
is
good
for
one
thing
a
high
abv
to
discuss
its
qualities
in
detail
would
be
akin
to
evaluating
the
finer
points
of
taco
bell
that
being
said
it
really
tastes
no
worse
than
any
other
malt
liquor
ive
had
and
it
is
extremely
inexpensive
seeing
people
mention
here
that
they
have
picked
it
up
for
1
25
makes
me
extremely
jealous
as
in
my
area
i
have
never
seen
it
cost
under
1
75
after
tax
d
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
expected
but
it
certainly
wasnt
good
maybe
i
should
slow
down
after
all
it
is
only
halftime
drinkable
um
like
hell
no
i
purchased
a
massive
24ounce
can
for
1
08
at
a
local
grocery
store
why
so
ba
member
roydrinksitall
can
review
this
beer
merry
christmas
to
the
rest
of
you
avoid
this
beer
at
1
39
for
a
24ounce
can
with
10
6
alcvol
i
knew
off
the
top
of
my
head
this
will
probably
be
a
bad
experience
i
was
right
for
1
and
change
youre
getting
the
equivalent
of
about
4
standard
abv
beers
since
i
dont
like
anything
to
go
to
waste
i
will
continue
drinking
slowly
but
surely
the
rest
it
tastes
like
a
carbonated
watereddown
cheap
whiskey
to
me
if
you
are
a
broke
college
student
wanting
to
get
drunk
on
a
budget
this
is
seriously
a
steal
id
actually
prefer
icehouse
beer
over
the
camo
as
far
as
taste
and
i
dont
even
like
icehouse
you
get
what
you
pay
for
rjt
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
offering
with
a
high
abv
and
dont
have
serious
plans
the
next
day
go
for
it
it
has
the
ability
to
surprise
being
a
dryer
malt
liquor
than
others
but
it
doesnt
take
long
to
realize
youre
practically
drinking
ethenolflavored
beer
overall
it
is
better
than
i
feared
still
if
you
buy
a
can
of
this
you
know
it
will
not
be
bcs
camo
silver
ice
is
one
cheap
brew
with
an
abv
of
10
6
per
12
oz
the
taste
is
just
pain
awful
i
got
the
whole
24
oz
can
down
i
will
not
get
this
brew
again
even
if
it
is
cheap
rot
gut
and
death
in
a
can
the
color
is
a
dark
amberyellow
color
smell
of
alcohol
and
cheap
brew
obviously
its
not
craft
but
if
you
were
expecting
craft
theres
no
reason
to
even
buy
this
for
what
it
is
though
did
camo
pull
a
homer
with
this
one
why
the
hell
do
i
kinda
like
it
i
dont
quite
understand
why
everyone
has
such
a
problem
with
camo
silver
ice
i
just
cracked
open
a
40
ounce
widemouth
and
am
finding
it
to
be
quite
enjoyable
theres
an
aroma
reminiscent
of
grapes
that
is
quite
pleasing
the
flavor
is
mildly
hoppy
and
very
smooth
i
would
compare
this
to
a
sort
of
microbrew
in
the
taste
department
at
10
6
abv
you
get
your
moneys
worth
which
is
something
i
cant
say
about
many
microbrews
or
common
type
beers
for
the
drinker
on
a
budget
i
wholeheartedly
recommend
camo
silver
ice
try
it
i
guarantee
that
you
wont
be
disappointed
o
it
tastes
like
most
high
gravity
malt
liquors
but
the
9
raises
the
bar
for
those
who
are
just
drinking
to
get
drunk
one
last
comment
the
reason
i
specify
silver
ice
is
because
the
camo
black
ice
10
5
is
really
bad
tasting
because
it
has
such
a
foul
first
taste
and
going
down
is
hard
to
get
through
and
thus
i
say
stick
to
camo
9
0
drinking
something
this
godawful
really
makes
one
appreciate
the
good
stuff
even
more
o
well
it
does
go
down
easily
thanks
to
its
watery
qualities
but
as
far
as
taste
think
ill
be
holding
off
on
my
next
drink
of
this
for
quite
a
while
mouthfeel
drinkability
extremeley
drinkable
but
i
dont
really
want
to
drink
it
all
it
was
ok
not
terrible
for
what
it
is
but
still
pretty
poor
considering
the
abv
and
the
price
a
24
ouncer
for
a
buck
i
figured
id
give
it
a
go
as
far
as
appearance
the
cans
all
thugged
out
uhh
idk
looks
like
malt
liquor
smells
like
an
adjunct
with
a
distinct
smell
of
applestastes
the
same
with
a
big
kick
of
alcoholactually
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
for
the
abv
but
times
a
factor
here
fellas
once
it
started
gettin
to
the
bottom
of
the
can
and
starts
warmin
uplike
any
malt
liquor
starts
to
be
nausiating
so
either
do
what
i
do
and
pop
it
in
the
freezer
beforehand
or
just
gulp
it
down
overall
a
damn
good
malt
liquor
for
the
price
i
will
definitly
be
buying
this
again
you
always
know
youre
in
for
an
adventure
when
the
beer
is
available
exclusively
in
40
oz
bottles
this
is
the
cheapest
40
i
have
ever
had
at
1
79
but
i
will
say
that
it
is
better
than
most
other
malt
liquors
in
a
40
oz
bottle
skunky
taste
horrible
coloring
excess
carbonation
the
usual
malt
liquor
is
usually
terrible
this
is
no
different
bought
this
24
oz
can
for
75
cents
on
sale
appearance
i
have
to
give
average
as
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
corn
oil
golden
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
mostly
cooking
apples
for
some
reason
cooking
apples
and
a
bit
of
soap
actually
not
as
horrific
as
i
expected
taste
again
sour
cooking
apples
with
some
rubbing
alcohol
palte
thin
yet
sticky
in
an
unpleasing
way
overall
really
not
as
bad
as
i
expected
if
you
like
cooking
apples
uk
you
will
tolerate
this
one
way
better
than
the
awesomely
bad
camo
genuine
ale
poured
from
a
clear
40
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
not
as
malty
as
i
expected
taste
is
yuck
overpowering
flavor
of
alcohol
really
nothing
else
feels
yucky
in
the
mouth
and
drinkability
is
awful
overall
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
drank
in
recent
memory
conclusion
drinking
this
was
the
result
of
me
losing
a
stupid
bet
please
not
again
as
one
of
my
friends
pointed
out
this
tastes
like
the
floor
of
a
bar
well
what
id
assume
the
floor
of
a
bar
tastes
like
pretty
accurate
it
began
with
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
but
experienced
such
low
retention
that
it
became
wisps
even
before
i
finished
pouring
color
was
a
lemonyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
was
fusel
really
bitingly
so
phew
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
hot
alcohol
burn
on
the
tongue
obscuring
any
flavor
a
second
swallow
evinced
a
sweettartness
like
a
candy
but
not
a
good
one
finish
left
me
breathless
but
not
in
a
good
way
oof
it
pours
a
golden
color
there
is
a
lot
of
carbonation
to
both
the
head
and
body
the
head
is
white
and
watery
there
is
not
much
retention
on
the
head
but
the
lace
is
very
spread
out
the
smell
is
piney
and
little
tropical
fruit
like
both
the
taste
and
the
aroma
are
adjunct
very
malty
and
sweet
a
little
corn
like
there
is
some
pine
like
tones
there
is
no
real
aftertaste
maybe
a
little
bit
of
a
liquor
pours
light
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
1
finger
head
that
dissipated
quickly
smelled
sweet
and
like
alcohol
tastes
like
a
big
fat
mcnasty
it
tasted
like
they
mixed
a
cheap
beer
with
cheap
tequila
alcohol
was
overwhelming
this
one
did
taste
better
straight
from
the
can
however
which
still
isnt
saying
much
avoid
unless
you
want
a
cheap
buzz
but
still
if
thats
what
your
looking
for
your
better
of
drinking
liquor
anyway
this
man
can
pours
a
semi
bright
golden
color
with
a
medium
sized
bleach
white
cap
that
leaves
some
small
amounts
of
lace
the
nose
smells
of
something
a
bit
rottenwith
strong
notes
of
fermentation
very
apparent
i
have
had
malt
liquor
offerings
that
have
been
offered
to
the
drain
as
sacrifice
and
i
must
say
this
one
is
drinkablebut
that
is
about
it
this
is
really
not
that
enjoyableit
tastes
like
a
watered
down
chardonnay
slightly
rotten
grapes
and
saw
dust
makes
up
the
flavor
profile
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
there
must
be
a
lot
of
very
undiscerning
alcoholics
waiting
to
get
paid
on
friday
to
keeping
this
brewery
in
business
drinkable
oncebut
never
again
drinking
this
beer
is
nothing
short
of
orgasmic
goes
down
rythmic
and
silky
seamless
the
nectar
of
the
gods
camo
if
you
havent
tried
this
liquid
delicacy
at
this
point
in
your
life
i
would
do
some
serious
reevaluation
overall
a
really
terrible
beer
and
i
feel
sorry
for
people
who
think
this
is
good
beer
you
are
entitled
to
drink
what
you
want
but
when
i
think
of
what
they
are
missing
in
good
beer
its
a
shame
this
gives
real
beer
a
bad
name
what
the
heck
why
not
try
another
cheapo
should
have
known
this
one
would
be
that
bad
sure
it
was
only
2
50
but
that
doesnt
matter
it
pours
a
lifeless
medium
yelow
with
a
white
fizzy
quickly
diminishing
head
smells
of
musty
strawlike
weak
grains
and
a
little
harsh
alcohol
tastes
the
same
except
with
a
more
pronounced
harsh
alcohol
burn
it
has
a
light
body
oily
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
no
reason
to
drink
this
stuff
unless
your
looking
for
a
cheap
buzz
which
is
what
im
sure
this
swill
was
created
for
i
saw
this
at
a
house
party
and
gave
it
a
try
my
mistake
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
white
head
that
is
soon
gone
aromas
on
bitter
yeast
and
moldy
dirt
the
flavor
profile
is
no
better
possibly
similar
to
ea85
gas
body
is
light
and
watery
over
carbonated
stay
away
if
you
can
the
taste
is
also
basically
a
cheap
musty
sweet
white
wine
with
a
faint
hint
of
grain
in
the
finish
the
alcohol
is
quite
noticeable
in
the
taste
but
the
palate
is
rather
watery
lacking
the
smooth
fullness
of
something
like
steel
reserve
i
enjoy
drinking
40s
however
i
did
not
enjoy
this
particular
40
the
appearance
is
a
mediumcolored
goldenyellow
the
smell
was
not
particularily
good
and
after
the
first
sip
i
could
tell
why
my
god
i
had
to
power
through
this
40
usually
the
bad
ones
taste
better
by
the
end
but
even
with
a
decent
buzz
this
40
kept
me
on
my
toes
tastes
very
sweet
think
of
granulated
sugar
mixed
with
a
little
wheat
and
some
water
thanks
but
no
thanks
camo
there
are
much
better
40s
out
there
it
looks
like
camo
silver
ice
has
squeaked
out
a
win
in
malt
likkapalooza
vii
on
the
strength
of
its
superior
appearance
again
most
will
never
see
the
result
of
the
fine
craftsmanship
that
went
into
the
brewing
of
this
high
gravity
lager
unless
you
have
a
masochistic
streak
a
mile
wide
id
suggest
steering
clear
of
either
one
of
these
brews
i
figured
id
try
one
of
the
camo
products
its
not
good
but
i
can
drink
it
exploring
different
styles
than
i
normally
drink
is
interesting
at
least
thats
what
i
keep
telling
myself
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
an
ok
lager
for
getting
drunk
but
if
your
looking
for
quality
i
wouldnt
really
reccomend
this
one
appearance
straw
color
golden
tone
with
a
large
bubbled
white
head
leaves
thin
spread
lacing
aroma
smells
of
cooked
veggies
namingly
corn
and
rice
sugary
sweetness
some
actual
fruity
notes
in
there
as
well
possibly
pear
kinda
weird
taste
consists
of
sugary
cornrice
adjuncts
slightly
syrupy
with
a
pretty
harsh
mix
of
flavors
alcohol
evident
at
9
wow
this
stuff
is
not
something
one
should
drink
on
the
regular
when
a
pour
college
student
needs
to
get
mildly
lubricated
on
limited
money
supply
theres
really
no
better
time
to
sample
cheap
ass
malt
liquors
mouthfeel
somewhat
syrupy
light
to
medium
bodied
artificial
carbonation
drinkability
not
something
i
will
be
drinking
regularly
interesting
experience
clear
pale
in
color
with
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
disappears
aromas
of
vegetables
fish
light
grains
and
dms
flavor
is
fairly
clean
and
it
tastes
like
corn
hints
of
paint
thinner
and
gasoline
as
well
gruesome
beware
must
malt
liquor
reviews
require
250
characters
drinkability
it
could
be
better
if
the
alcohol
kick
was
a
bit
subdued
but
could
for
getting
drunk
fast
and
cheap
as
it
goes
for
the
silver
ice
original
and
genuine
ale
the
camo
silver
ice
would
definately
be
the
least
vile
the
fact
that
it
is
ice
brewed
and
slightly
more
drinkable
make
it
camo
of
choice
if
it
camo
is
the
only
choice
it
has
a
sub
average
appearance
slightly
dark
with
a
frothy
head
smell
isnt
anything
special
the
taste
is
that
same
old
horrible
sickly
sweet
taste
only
not
as
strong
the
mouthfeel
is
kinda
watery
the
reduced
taste
high
alcohol
and
ice
brewyness
increase
drinkabilty
alcohol
hits
you
hard
than
the
original
which
is
good
because
of
the
shitty
taste
it
is
not
like
i
am
gonna
come
back
to
this
unless
i
have
to
maybe
this
weekend
because
i
am
paying
off
a
speeding
ticket
but
for
two
bucks
i
was
falling
all
over
the
place
on
the
way
to
bed
pours
a
deep
gold
with
a
two
finger
head
that
remains
for
about
30
seconds
strong
malt
aroma
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
smooth
for
a
high
gravity
lager
however
the
taste
puts
this
beer
where
it
belongs
on
the
bottom
shelf
this
is
a
beer
best
served
cold
when
you
cant
scrape
together
enough
change
for
a
40
oz
but
want
to
get
drunk
ive
had
fairly
good
high
gravity
lagers
before
camo
silver
ice
high
gravity
lager
is
not
one
of
them
go
figure
a
nice
little
joke
someone
is
playing
on
the
uneducated
public
comes
in
a
tall
24
oz
silver
can
with
stencil
style
lettering
i
poured
the
contents
into
a
liter
mug
color
was
a
pale
yellow
that
would
do
any
macro
brew
proud
the
coarse
white
head
was
huge
and
left
a
lot
of
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
smell
was
corny
with
the
added
aroma
of
alcohol
taste
was
cloying
sweetness
corn
and
alcohol
burn
the
taste
had
a
harshness
that
the
regular
camo
lacked
in
fact
i
only
finished
half
of
this
before
the
other
half
hit
the
kitchen
sink
absolutely
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
tasted
cheap
and
strong
strong
and
cheap
i
drank
it
straight
from
its
24
oz
silver
can
smell
skunky
and
corny
taste
is
so
offensive
it
was
a
chore
to
take
a
sip
about
halfway
through
the
second
can
i
couldnt
taste
it
because
of
its

not
a

product
unless
you

looking
for
a
cheap
buzz

stuff
is
awful
this
is
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
have
ever
consumed
only
the
brave
or
very
insanely
curious
should
attempt
to
drink
