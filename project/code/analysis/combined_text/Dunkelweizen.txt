i
find
this
to
be
strangely
alluring
and
complex
i
get
a
lot
of
belgian
yeast
aromas
and
flavors
of
peppercorn
anise
and
clove
there
are
some
wheat
tones
molasses
bubblegumlike
sweetness
and
barley
malt
it
feels
a
bit
cheap
but
i
like
the
flavors
and
diversity
of
this
beer
the
flavor
is
very
nice
as
well
closely
following
the
aroma
all
of
the
flavors
could
be
stronger
overall
but
this
beer
nails
it
in
the
drinkability
category
slightly
sweet
mouthfeel
with
decent
body
for
5
99
a
six
pack
you
really
cant
go
wrong
here
smells
sweet
wheat
slight
banana
fresh
fruit
looks
reddish
brown
very
opaque
pours
with
a
nice
off
white
head
taste
is
very
sweet
bread
like
lots
a
yeasty
flavors
extremely
drinkable
overall
very
good
beer
for
the
price
i
was
quite
surprised
by
this
beer
its
got
the
traditional
appearance
although
the
head
retention
and
lacing
dont
live
up
to
the
finest
bavarian
examples
the
body
and
mouthfeel
are
what
youd
expect
as
well
although
slightly
on
the
thin
side
the
flavor
and
aroma
are
where
it
stands
out
i
was
expecting
a
standard
dunkelweizen
which
generally
displays
less
fermentation
character
than
their
hefewiezen
brethren
but
this
ones
loaded
with
dark
fruit
spicy
clovebubblegum
and
banana
its
gently
caramelish
with
a
light
dollop
of
honey
as
well
and
its
balanced
by
a
combination
of
mild
bitterness
herbal
hops
and
its
softly
spicy
and
mildly
tart
yeast
its
certainly
not
the
best
expression
of
the
style
available
but
at
the
same
time
given
the
price
its
hard
to
ignore
aroma
is
herbs
fruit
hint
of
spice
and
roast
and
banana
taste
overthetop
sugarysweet
musk
wheat
malt
caramel
more
of
citrus
and
wheat
sourness
scant
head
of
white
bubbles
fairly
typical
wheat
beer
generally
not
a
big
fan
but
i
didnt
enjoy
this
one
much
at
all
o
very
impressive
and
inexpensive
version
of
this
german
style
quite
good
sweet
and
banana
bready
with
a
tingly
spiceandcarbonation
bite
in
the
back
end
o
this
beer
lacks
a
lot
of
the
complexity
that
i
have
come
to
expect
for
the
style
though
i
guess
i
should
have
tempered
by
expectations
based
on
the
pretty
low
price
point
for
the
beer
less
than
1
for
a
single
easy
to
drink
but
not
interesting
enough
to
grab
again
easy
drinking
tasty
dunkelweizen
more
caramel
more
banana
notes
malty
but
quite
dry
in
the
finish
meh
not
really
as
flavorful
and
complex
as
the
heavy
hitters
of
the
style
easy
drinking
enough
and
fairly
priced
worth
a
try
but
nothing
special
rjt
overall
maybe
not
a
perfect
dunkelweizen
but
a
darn
good
one
and
one
of
the
better
if
only
because
one
of
the
only
stabs
at
the
style
that
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
gordon
biersch
sure
know
their
german
styles
eh
at
5
99
a
sixer
its
a
steal
maybe
my
goto
beer
this
summer
well
see
i
cant
tell
if
this
was
a
bad
batch
or
what
tastes
and
smells
like
a
sponge
thats
been
sitting
in
the
sink
for
three
weeks
real
metallic
bitterness
like
if
you
bit
the
inside
of
your
cheek
and
tasted
blood
tainted
by
some
amazonian
mosquito
transferred
disease
i
will
be
going
back
to
this
one
good
for
what
it
is
cheap
body
is
medium
but
isnt
as
thick
and
chewy
as
id
like
for
this
style
overall
the
beer
isnt
bad
tho
the
banana
flavors
are
making
it
quite
enjoyable
for
me
good
job
hippy
supermarket
dudez
sour
and
puke
bottom
of
the
vat
poured
out
the
whole
sixpack
been
enjoying
this
beer
all
summer
but
sorry
trader
joes
im
off
my
feed
for
life
as
far
as
this
beer
goes
this
beer
was
so
awful
im
just
going
to
get
straight
to
the
point
i
dumped
it
out
after
a
few
sips
its
way
too
syrupy
tasting
and
watered
down
did
not
taste
like
a
wheat
beer
at
all
just
tasted
like
a
really
bad
amber
almost
no
carbonation
and
it
smelled
like
rotten
fruit
i
rarely
dump
a
beer
out
but
i
could
not
stand
this
one
i
guess
thats
what
i
get
for
buying
it
for
a
buck
at
trader
joes
tip
serve
this
beer
closer
to
room
temperature
than
to
refrigerator
temperature
o
this
beer
doesnt
have
as
many
complexities
in
the
taste
compared
to
some
of
the
german
dunkelweizens
but
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
fair
representation
of
the
style
its
a
pretty
good
value
for
a
beer
from
trader
joes
a
fairly
clear
ice
tea
color
with
just
a
couple
of
yellowish
bubbles
no
retention
whatsoever
the
nose
is
of
underripe
banana
roasted
malt
butterscotch
caramel
and
some
cocoa
powder
on
the
palate
butterscotch
and
caramel
roll
onto
the
tongue
with
banana
cocoa
and
some
mild
roast
the
finish
is
of
sweet
caramelbutterscotch
and
banana
lighter
body
with
medium
carbonation
lingering
roast
and
cocoa
a
fairly
average
dunkle
that
hits
all
the
style
notes
but
really
does
nothing
for
me
josephsbrau
dunkelweizen
is
a
cloudy
and
lively
dark
amber
beer
with
a
thin
soft
slightly
yellow
film
that
leaves
nice
lacing
it
has
an
aroma
of
clove
banana
plum
and
dark
malt
it
smells
pretty
spicy
and
a
little
sweet
perfect
for
this
kind
of
beer
its
medium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
the
finish
isnt
very
tight
and
leaves
the
tongue
feeling
starchy
wheat
is
certainly
the
dominant
flavor
lemon
clove
stone
fruit
and
an
herbal
note
are
present
the
flavor
isnt
as
strong
as
the
aroma
there
isnt
really
any
bitterness
here
and
the
sweetness
is
barely
detectable
this
is
pretty
pleasant
i
could
have
more
than
one
of
these
warmer
again
very
enjoyable
flavor
but
the
coolest
thing
was
simply
the
drastic
change
in
flavor
that
i
experienced
loved
this
beer
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
medium
to
dark
redorange
amber
with
a
fine
two
finger
offwhite
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
caramel
malt
banana
butterscotch
and
cloves
flavor
follows
with
caramel
malt
butterscotch
dark
and
light
stone
fruit
and
clove
medium
bodied
nice
combination
of
flavors
but
a
bit
sweet
and
attentuated
in
the
finish
it
fits
the
bill
for
its
intent
a
decent
pleasant
dunkelweizen
at
a
good
price
point
the
verdict
not
bad
im
not
familiar
with
the
style
but
if
you
were
looking
for
a
banana
flavored
hefe
this
would
be
it
i
wont
reach
for
this
first
when
i
head
to
trader
joes
but
i
wont
turn
it
down
if
you
offer
me
one
either
got
this
in
a
home
made
beer
advent
calendar
and
i
didnt
realize
this
was
trader
joes
brand
it
pours
a
cloudy
deep
redbrown
with
thin
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
ripe
banana
with
malty
dark
fruit
the
nice
banana
estery
character
in
the
flavor
fades
a
bit
too
quickly
into
thin
malt
overall
there
are
some
nice
things
going
on
in
this
beer
and
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
hop
bombs
ive
been
drinking
but
it
falls
a
bit
flat
for
the
price
of
1
a
bottle
this
is
pretty
decent
id
take
some
of
these
tailgating
certainly
better
than
the
bmc
stuff
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
and
a
touch
full
lacks
complex
yeast
esters
of
the
more
notable
brands
i
didnt
realize
that
joseph
brau
was
their
own
beer
till
now
still
i
commend
trader
joes
for
offering
bavarian
beers
and
give
the
store
a
thumbs
up
i
may
have
gotten
an
off
sixer
as
the
other
reviews
seem
to
like
it
taste
throws
more
banana
than
cloves
and
the
chocolate
is
light
but
noticeable
malts
are
pretty
light
overall
and
the
carbonation
is
nice
and
fluffy
this
is
not
too
shabby
of
a
brew
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
and
is
probably
a
leading
candidate
for
best
value
dunkelweiss
im
having
a
tough
time
coming
up
with
anything
decent
for
less
than
8
a
sixer
maybe
michelobs
dunkelweisse
is
the
closest
o
pretty
damn
average
on
all
counts
but
theres
a
modicum
of
enjoyment
to
be
found
here
its
cheap
as
hell
so
its
still
definitely
worth
a
look
o
not
great
but
a
solid
dunkelweizen
and
better
than
most
made
outside
of
germany
its
also
reasonably
priced
for
which
i
gave
it
an
extra
half
point
so
ill
be
getting
more
of
this
in
the
future
hands
down
this
is
the
best
dunkelweizen
i
have
ever
tasted
for
only
5
49
a
six
pack
i
am
impressed
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
good
beer
and
a
great
value
at
around
6
50
for
a
six
pack
c
overall
though
my
thoughts
are
contrary
to
many
others
this
one
is
a
nice
dunkelweizen
which
stays
true
to
the
style
which
some
venture
away
from
poured
this
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
poured
a
hazy
brown
color
produced
a
average
white
head
average
retention
and
it
left
some
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
consisted
of
ripe
banana
and
fresh
baked
bread
medium
in
body
this
dunkelweizen
consisted
of
sweet
malted
wheat
and
banana
overall
it
is
an
average
example
of
the
style
dont
regret
drinking
a
glass
but
i
wont
seek
it
out
in
the
future
prost
o
for
the
price
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
this
is
similar
in
taste
to
sprecher
hefe
weiss
but
a
much
better
deal
i
will
have
this
one
again
o
while
i
thought
this
beer
was
decent
i
probably
wont
be
reaching
for
another
while
i
think
it
was
brewed
pretty
much
to
style
there
was
a
bit
too
much
vanilla
esters
in
the
flavor
to
my
liking
i
thought
it
took
away
from
the
other
fruity
and
potentially
spicy
esters
maybe
they
could
try
a
different
yeast
that
would
have
so
much
of
a
vanilla
profile
a
surprisingly
good
dunkel
for
not
a
lot
of
cash
appearance
is
a
cloudy
brown
with
orangey
highlights
nice
tan
head
that
fades
to
a
light
covering
that
stays
a
touch
of
lace
here
and
there
active
carbonation
is
working
all
the
way
down
smell
is
where
starts
to
impress
it
is
full
of
overripe
banana
and
clove
there
is
some
nice
malted
wheat
that
cuts
through
and
a
lovely
yeast
ester
that
works
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
and
pepper
taste
is
again
a
really
solid
effort
all
the
flavors
you
want
and
previewed
in
the
nose
wrapped
in
a
banana
bread
with
raisins
wheat
malt
gives
a
solid
core
finish
is
mild
as
it
should
be
slightly
tart
apples
creep
in
with
a
darn
near
perfect
balance
that
leaves
more
banana
and
clove
and
a
mild
floral
hop
bitterness
feel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
lightly
tingly
carbonation
light
creaminess
super
drinkable
and
my
new
winter
session
brew
at
6
50
a
six
this
is
a
stupendous
value
if
you
like
dunkel
and
you
are
feeling
the
tight
economy
buy
a
six
of
this
and
put
your
cares
aside
for
a
while
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
fizzy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
dark
malt
dark
fruit
banana
spices
and
yeast
a
nice
carameltoffee
smell
comes
about
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
of
dark
fruit
and
banana
up
front
followed
by
spice
and
yeast
flavors
the
dark
malt
flavor
comes
through
on
the
aftertaste
and
provides
a
slightly
bready
taste
this
beer
has
only
a
slight
level
of
carbonation
and
seems
a
bit
stickysyrupy
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
but
it
smells
better
than
it
tastes
also
a
deal
at
1
a
bottle
o
i
actually
like
this
beer
buck
a
bottle
you
really
cant
beat
it
overall
i
didnt
really
appreciate
this
beer
for
a
dunkelweizen
it
seemed
to
be
lacking
several
characteristic
odors
and
flavors
that
i
do
enjoy
and
miss
when
not
found
i
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
though
their
hefeweizen
was
much
truer
to
style
decent
for
this
style
and
for
a
cheap
trader
joes
beer
but
i
think
ill
stick
to
other
styles
at
trader
joes
as
i
much
prefer
other
dunkelweizens
o
another
solid
trader
joes
beer
at
the
same
price
as
bmc
i
really
cant
complain
with
a
b
beer
medium
brown
pour
with
a
slight
reddish
touch
to
the
sides
yielded
a
nice
head
of
off
white
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
fairly
well
as
it
trickled
down
aroma
is
nice
and
earthy
with
touches
of
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
coming
through
as
it
warms
nice
deep
flavor
nothing
over
the
top
but
nice
and
consistent
for
the
style
about
what
i
would
expect
from
them

is
a
concern
seeing
how
crappily
tjs
take
care
of
their
beers
happily
it
is
not
a
problem
there
is
a
slight

which
is
unusual
for
style
but
it
works
against
the
spices
and
bubble
gum
well
semi
sweet
wheatiness
actually
very
nice
ok
on
the
tongue
not
to
thin
and
to
style
overall
a
very
nice
sour
wheat
beer
aroma
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
firm

overtone
that
is

apple
with

of

nice
fresh

though
i
would
recommend
overall
was
this
a
bad

this
was
atrociously
bad
i
drank
just
enough
of
the
bottle
to
ascertain
the
relevant
information
and
poured
the
rest
o
an
interesting
flavor
pours
a
rich
deep
amber
color
smells
fabulous
i
detected
honey
cloves
and
other
spices
that
almost
gave
it
a
floral
smell
it
doesnt
taste
too
bad
either
pleasantly
spiced
with
a
rich
and
complex
flavor
somewhere
between
the
smell
and
taste
i
got
a
hint
of
banana
i
think
its
a
very
curious
aromatic
beer
i
think
ill
definitely
be
trying
it
again
o
overall
its
a
pretty
decent
dunkelweizen
and
quite
a
bargain
in
the
price
to
quality
ratio
craft
beer
at
bmc
price
is
always
welcome
in
my
book
all
in
all
drinkable
but
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
for
the
price
certainly
not
bad
id
consider
picking
up
a
pack
again
but
not
exactly
one
id
seek
out
o
this
is
a
solid
dunkelweizen
and
for
the
price
it
is
well
worth
it
if
youre
in
a
frugal
state
of
mind
this
isnt
a
bad
way
to
go
i
would
say
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
be
enjoyed
perhaps
with
a
meal
but
not
to
cool
off
with
or
drink
quickly
poured
a
hazy
amber
headlacing
were
nothing
special
smelled
great
very
sweet
with
the
obvious
banana
and
other
sweet
notes
as
well
as
spices
including
cinnamon
taste
was
also
sweet
but
was
less
complex
than
other
varieties
focusing
more
and
the
fruit
notes
than
anything
else
maintained
a
pretty
high
level
of
carbonation
through
finishing
the
glass
smooth
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
there
are
better
dunkelweizens
out
there
but
as
far
as
the
price
to
quality
ratio
goes
this
is
likely
the
best
compared
to
other
dunkelweizens
that
i
have
had
this
one
drinks
more
like
a
traditional
hefe
than
most
if
i
had
one
complaint
that
would
be
it
however
its
very
tasty
and
for
the
price
point
you
really
just
cannot
go
wrong
o
for
66pack
this
actually
is
a
pretty
good
beer
the
aroma
and
taste
are
right
to
spec
just
nothing
too
intense
and
nothing
overdone
a
solid
above
average
beer
pours
a
light
caramel
brown
color
with
an
aggressive
foamy
beige
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
the
aroma
is
sweet
but
not
dense
with
a
combination
of
brown
sugar
and
ripe
bananas
being
most
apparent
these
characteristics
continue
through
into
the
flavor
but
there
is
also
more
of
a
yeasty
earthiness
along
with
a
light
milk
caramel
character
the
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
allows
each
layer
of
the
sweet
malty
profile
to
make
its
mark
overall
i
would
consider
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
too
sweet
but
not
so
much
that
it
becomes
a
chore
to
drink
rather
i
would
call
it
pleasantly
oversweetened
m
the
sweetness
it
not
present
but
at
some
point
you
feel
some
bitterness
that
last
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
o
overall
a
decent
dunkelweizen
especially
for
the
price
an
outstanding
value
but
i
liked
the
beer
less
as
i
got
to
the
end
of
it
the
flatness
didnt
really
help
here
t
lots
of
banana
and
a
bit
of
clove
with
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
a
hint
of
roasted
malt
something
slightly
citruslike
and
lemony
towards
the
finish
not
my
favorite
of
the
trader
joes
beers
overall
a
very
solid
dunkel
and
one
of
the
best
values
you
can
find
for
the
price
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
interpretation
of
the
style
for
the
price
it
is
a
good
beer
to
have
on
hand
when
you
want
something
other
than
another
pale
ale
or
ipa
my
expectations
were
that
dunkelweizen
amber
unfiltered
wheat
beer
would
be
a
darker
but
otherwise
similar
version
of
hefeweizen
though
that
didnt
turn
out
to
be
the
case
this
is
a
lovely
version
that
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
punch
in
a
1
single
a
several
bottle
purchase
on
all
future
trips
to
trader
joes
is
a
nobrainer
quality
beer
and
the
right
price
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
and
at
a
great
price
to
boot
watching
a
somewhat
surprisingly
good
game
here
between
the
cards
and
the
pads
i
figured
id
grab
a
beer
and
this
is
what
came
out
of
the
fridge
it
pours
a
generally
clear
sunset
amber
topped
by
just
under
a
finger
of
dirty
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
corn
mild
rye
bread
light
black
pepper
and
just
a
pinch
of
nutmeg
the
taste
darkens
the
wheat
slightly
sours
the
rye
a
bit
and
seems
to
pour
on
the
black
pepper
as
though
twere
going
out
of
style
i
dont
know
about
anyone
else
but
there
are
times
where
i
find
the
pepper
a
bit
oerwhelming
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
prickly
feeling
though
this
comes
more
from
the
pepperyness
than
the
carbonation
overall
i
think
this
could
have
been
a
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
but
something
went
awry
at
some
point
in
the
process
a
definite
disappointment
slamdunk
for
5
99
a
sixpack
there
are
few
beers
that
are
this
inexpensive
that
taste
this
good
which
fits
trader
joes
motif
nicely
another
session
beer
for
me
poured
a
nice
orangeamberbrownish
color
with
some
beige
head
on
it
sweet
malt
aroma
with
some
fruit
coming
through
great
tasting
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
not
too
heavy
hint
of
smokiness
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
could
definitely
see
myself
having
a
handful
of
these
no
problem
wow
for
5
75
a
sixer
this
is
a
really
good
beer
id
happily
pay
7
75
for
a
sixer
of
this
i
wish
i
got
another
then
again
it
was
6
a
sixer
recommended
to
try
maybe
i
got
an
older
bottle
nice
job
tjs
for
doing
a
seldomhad
style
on
the
cheap
d
goes
down
easy
from
fall
brew
ranking
notes
2010
the
aroma
is
loaded
with
banana
and
moderate
bubblegum
theres
a
hint
of
roast
but
the
banana
is
pretty
dominant
it
pours
a
cloudy
brownishorange
with
a
small
offwhite
head
the
flavor
starts
with
strong
banana
theres
a
faint
roastiness
in
the
background
the
finish
has
bubblegum
and
some
tangy
wheat
flavors
medium
bodied
moderate
carbonation
and
a
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
d
ok
but
nothing
spectacular
middle
of
the
road
cant
get
past
the
smoke
flavor
so
ill
likely
pass
on
this
in
the
future
drinkability
very
high
if
you
like
the
banana
quality
of
german
hefeweizens
i
implore
you
to
head
to
trader
joes
and
try
this
beer
at
only
5
99
a
six
pack
it
is
something
that
can
be
afforded
on
a
regular
basis
as
well
drinkability
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
price
a
great
picnic
or
lawnmower
beer
this
beer
is
a
very
dark
amber
almost
brown
color
quite
cloudy
and
a
thick
notquitedarkenoughtobetan
colored
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
and
a
little
spicy
with
banana
and
fruitcake
like
scents
its
lightmedium
bodied
and
quite
smooth
the
flavor
is
very
similar
to
the
aroma
it
basically
tastes
like
liquid
banana
bread
but
its
not
overly
sweet
quite
a
good
dunkelweizen
an
incredible
beer
for
the
cost
taste
is
unmistakably
hefe
not
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
body
with
this
one
but
very
smooth
and
super
easy
on
the
palate
i
dont
care
for
super
hoppy
tart
beers
and
this
fits
the
bill
perfectly
in
fact
this
would
make
a
very
refreshing
beverage
on
a
hot
summer
day
perfect
for
barbecues
with
friends
pours
a
translucent
amberdarkbrown
body
with
a
small
head
dwindling
down
to
a
thin
film
of
lacing
sitting
on
the
body
smells
distinctly
of
citrus
particularly
lemon
rye
bread
and
of
course
lager
yeast
tastes
of
yeast
strongly
has
a
dark
malty
sweetness
following
carbonation
and
has
a
slight
hop
feel
throughout
overall
quite
a
nice
beer
in
the
dunkelweizen
style
and
a
brew
i
would
easily
go
back
to
overall
as
i
mentioned
before
this
beer
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
in
the
wheat
category
d
easy
to
drink
i
dont
love
it
and
am
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
12oz
bottle
from
tjs
pours
cloudy
brown
with
tanned
long
lasting
head
the
aroma
of
bananas
caramel
and
brown
sugar
mediumbodied
the
flavor
of
bananas
and
brown
sugar
very
cloying
also
lightly
tart
the
finish
is
long
and
sweet
on
the
whole
is
not
bad
too
much
sweetness
though
a
thick
dense
head
on
this
malty
bavarianstyle
unfiltered
hefe
with
a
nice
scent
of
caramel
clove
and
banana
the
taste
is
bold
and
roasty
with
hints
of
buttery
biscuit
and
clove
spicy
and
tangy
not
bad
but
i
found
this
one
somewhat
lacking
in
balance
with
perhaps
a
tad
too
much
of
the
spiced
element
my
advice
for
5
99
a
sixer
this
is
hard
to
beat
no
unbeatable
not
a
bad
dunkelweizen
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
a
little
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
and
the
color
and
aroma
are
a
little
light
but
in
general
it
was
pretty
good
ill
buy
it
again
brown
color
with
tan
head
not
much
in
the
nose
some
clove
and
fruitiness
but
a
bit
muddled
taste
is
very
good
though
fruit
flavors
abound
with
grape
date
banana
green
apple
mild
clove
with
a
general
sweetness
light
on
the
hops
smooth
wheat
body
however
a
bit
fizzy
very
good
beer
overall
with
interesting
taste
wouldnt
easily
tire
of
it
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
somewhat
rich
drinkability
is
good
just
right
abv
and
good
flavor
i
will
buy
more
of
this
one
drinkability
not
the
best
dunkelweizen
overall
but
very
good
as
far
as
american
interpretations
go
this
one
was
definitely
a
pleasant
surprise
very
true
to
the
style
and
definitely
enjoyable
i
wasnt
expecting
a
true
germanic
version
of
a
dunkelweiss
and
thats
what
i
got
however
its
better
than
some
american
labled
wheats
pale
or
dark
the
price
wont
kill
you
as
its
5
99
a
six
pack
d
very
drinkable
dunkel
abv
is
certainly
manageable
flavors
are
smooth
well
integrated
only
knock
is
that
it
is
lightly
filling
as
i
approach
the
bottom
of
the
glass
very
refreshing
and
interesting
but
not
quite
on
par
with
their
bavarian
hefeweizen
also
brewed
by
gordon
biersch
i
believe
still
a
good
value
and
a
tasty
summer
beer
mouthfeel
is
pretty
strong
this
has
a
very
well
rounded
feel
to
it
sharp
but
not
to
sharp
flows
easily
which
leads
me
to
drinkabliity
it
is
very
good
with
fall
aproaching
i
dont
think
this
will
be
the
last
bottle
i
will
purchase
there
should
be
a
few
more
drinkability
this
style
is
a
toughie
to
hide
faults
in
so
im
not
surprised
a
get
a
bit
of
them
in
the
final
product
however
its
not
all
that
bad
and
if
youre
a
malt
hound
this
one
will
fit
the
bill
for
5
99
its
not
all
that
bad
drinkability
this
is
not
a
baddrinking
brew
and
its
worked
admirably
as
a
thirstquencher
for
me
today
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
make
a
session
out
of
this
even
with
its
low
alcohol
i
may
be
fooling
myself
but
i
could
almost
swear
i
could
taste
some
alcohol
in
this
one
d
good
stuff
id
buy
this
again
in
a
heartbeat
good
beer
at
a
very
reasonable
price
trader
joes
offers
some
really
good
stuff
for
less
than
6
per
six
pack
this
brew
is
not
the
most
friendly
for
its
light
body
it
is
still
rather
difficult
to
get
down
i
dont
think
ill
be
looking
for
this
one
in
the
future
overall
overall
its
a
decent
beer
my
bottle
tasted
slightly
old
but
i
could
tell
what
the
beer
was
saying
lovely
beer
for
a
massive
value
im
not
disappointed
at
all
im
rather
impressed
actually
for
5
99
a
six
pack
this
is
a
bargain
as
well
as
a
decent
beer
in
its
own
right
i
like
one
once
in
a
while
since
i
dont
see
many
of
this
style
but
tjs
hefewizen
is
a
better
beer
for
more
frequent
quaffing
i
think
and
of
course
the
price
is
hard
to
beat
murky
brown
color
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
is
strong
but
very
one
dimensional
with
banana
and
clove
doing
all
the
work
the
flavor
is
even
more
so
with
overripe
nearly
rotten
banana
overtaking
the
cloves
and
other
spices
for
dominance
a
little
metallic
from
this
bottle
the
mouthfeel
is
too
thin
to
be
good
but
its
not
bad
a
prick
of
carbonation
and
alcohol
on
the
finish
is
a
healthy
reminder
that
it
is
a
beer
drinkability
will
vary
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
too
sweet
and
onedimensional
to
be
considered
a
very
good
beer
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
hazy
brown
color
surprised
to
see
that
this
is
unfiltered
decent
beige
head
not
as
fizzy
as
other
tjs
beers
aroma
is
big
on
banana
oil
and
clove
with
a
clear
milk
chocolate
note
as
well
flavor
is
similar
cocoa
and
bread
with
a
lot
of
sweet
banana
and
bubblegum
and
a
light
clove
note
all
the
flavors
that
should
be
there
are
there
but
im
not
convinced
theyre
in
the
right
proportion
too
heavy
on
the
sweetness
body
is
medium
so
is
carbonation
a
pretty
good
beer
for
tjs
i
do
like
dunkelweizen
just
not
this
one
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
thing
white
head
that
fades
leaving
no
lacing
aromas
are
of
slight
fruity
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
rather
muted
but
still
holds
some
of
the
style
characteristics
that
match
the
aroma
the
mouth
feel
is
light
which
holds
to
easy
drinking
and
session
quality
this
isnt
what
i
want
in
a
dunkel
weizen
but
at
1
00
who
can
complain
buy
it
but
dont
think
too
long
and
hard
about
it
share
this
with
a
newcastle
brown
or
a
blue
moon
drinker
that
might
want
to
cross
over
into
craft
d
pretty
drinkable
wheat
brew
sweet
flavored
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
but
evens
out
my
first
brew
from
trader
joes
pretty
tasty
brew
for
such
a
cheap
price
i
good
beer
for
those
wanting
to
try
the
style
one
bottle
of
a
mixedsixer
i
received
from
my
parents
for
my
26th
birthday
i
dont
have
a
trader
joes
in
my
area
and
ive
heard
they
have
pretty
good
beer
and
they
were
right
and
at
a
buck
a
beer
you
cannot
go
wrong
go
check
out
trader
joes
and
give
this
stuff
a
try
drinkability
a
bit
lower
on
the
carbonation
and
a
touch
more
flavor
and
this
would
be
top
notch
very
good
job
by
an
american
brewer
murky
dark
brown
caramel
color
like
apple
cider
with
a
retentive
light
brown
head
and
dots
of
lacing
very
strong
aroma
mild
sweetness
bananas
cloves
yeast
etc
not
that
complex
but
pleasant
smooth
full
body
with
sharp
carbonation
almost
too
much
with
a
very
strong
banana
and
yeast
flavored
bodied
mild
sweetness
in
the
finish
not
much
spiciness
you
get
what
you
pay
for
here
not
the
best
dunkel
or
even
best
of
some
of
the
trader
joe
label
beers
but
one
of
my
favorites
since
this
is
a
style
i
enjoy
and
this
represents
it
well
drinkability
oh
sweet
nectar
its
not
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
had
and
not
as
impressive
as
tjs
bavarian
style
hefeweizen
but
its
decent
its
good
drinking
but
not
mind
blowing
d
easy
to
finish
and
a
great
value
considering
the
cost
something
ill
be
drinking
more
of
this
summer
check
this
one
out
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
trader
joes
d
one
of
the
better
trader
joes
brews
it
really
seemed
authentic
drinkability
decent
beer
overall
its
a
nice
dunkelweizen
for
the
money
wheats
for
the
most
part
are
just
not
my
thing
though
so
i
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
its
really
not
a
bad
dunkelweizen
especially
for
a
buck
a
bottle
simple
but
not
boring
and
probably
easy
to
session
and
much
to
my
surprise
my
girlfriend
enjoyed
it
gateway
beer
lets
hope
bought
at
trader
joes
it
seems
that
this
dunkel
is
brewed
by
gordon
biersch
out
of
ca
the
head
seemed
to
dissipate
rather
quickly
for
a
wheat
aromas
of
clove
banana
and
a
total
polyphenol
explosion
in
the
mouth
drinkable
not
as
dark
for
a
dunkel
as
i
would
like
but
for
the
uninitiated
in
this
style
it
may
be
worth
a
try
my
wife
who
usually
hates
hefes
actually
enjoyed
this
so
that
that
as
a
good
sign
or
a
bad
sign
cloudy
light
chestnut
with
a
really
small
off
white
head
that
leaves
some
fine
lace
on
the
glass
smells
of
overripe
banana
clove
and
citrus
tastes
of
gingerbread
and
citrusdecent
and
typical
for
the
style
medium
light
bodied
with
a
fairly
lively
carbonation
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
above
average
beer
good
quaffer
a
surprisingly
good
beer
there
are
definitely
better
dunkels
out
there
but
this
is
quite
good
and
easily
accessible
if
you
have
a
trader
joes
where
you
live
any
wow
factor
this
beer
had
was
in
the
smell
and
look
if
it
an
enjoyable
dunkelweizen
but
not
the
best
this
is
right
on
par
with
the
other
gb
dunkelweizen
so
close
im
going
to
drink
the
other
right
now
what
a
bargain
price
and
its
ok
to
mix
and
match
at
tjs
d
great
drinkability
and
a
fantastic
beer
for
the
price
pick
some
up
the
next
time
youre
at
trader
joes
alone
this
trader
joes
beer
was
a
little
bit
above
average
for
a
dunkelweizen
what
separates
this
above
average
average
beer
from
the
others
is
this
beers
low
price
i
believe
i
only
paid
1
for
this
beer
better
yet
its
really
good
too
would
i
drink
this
beer
again
i
sure
would
and
you
should
too
if
you
got
a
pocket
full
of
change
you
want
to
spend
then
you
might
as
well
buy
a
bottle
of
this
beer
poured
into
12oz
glass
poured
with
a
small
tan
head
that
quickly
dissipated
leaving
no
lacing
a
very
cloudy
almost
muddy
medium
brown
very
bold
aroma
a
lot
of
banana
and
clove
in
the
nose
the
flavor
also
has
noticeable
banana
and
clove
with
a
hint
of
spice
has
a
quick
sharp
bite
on
the
finish
the
body
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
but
not
detrimentally
so
solidly
drinkable
i
can
see
myself
drinking
more
of
these
as
the
weather
warms
this
a
trader
joes
house
brand
and
i
find
it
to
be
a
solid
value
a
basically
average
beer
for
the
style
for
6
00
a
6er
i
think
ill
explore
the
rest
of
tjs
house
brews
d
excellent
session
beer
i
enjoyed
the
taste
and
my
friends
loved
it
a
great
compromise
for
the
beer
aficionado
and
the
beer
newbie
will
definitely
buy
this
again
d
i
would
have
liked
to
rank
this
higher
except
for
the
really
bad
metallic
finish
and
aftertaste
drinkability
despite
an
initially
promising
beginning
based
upon
a
great
smell
this
beer
failed
to
perform
once
again
like
so
many
trader
joes
stuff
not
a
drain
pour
but
nothing
that
exciting
pours
an
extremely
cloudy
brown
with
a
tinge
of
amber
and
a
small
offwhite
head
that
doesnt
linger
some
folks
here
are
calling
it
muddy
but
i
happen
to
like
this
beer
considerably
and
prefer
to
compare
its
appearance
to
that
of
the
darker
unpasteurized
apple
ciders
powerful
clove
aroma
with
bananas
and
tons
of
yeast
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
simpler
than
it
could
be
but
is
good
nonetheless
wheaty
and
carmelized
malts
come
through
loud
and
clear
the
creamy
texture
and
mediumheavy
feel
of
this
brew
are
extremely
appealing
easily
my
favorite
of
the
beers
made
by
gordon
biersch
for
trader
joes
an
excellent
deal
pours
a
cloudy
brownamber
color
theres
a
small
head
with
poor
retention
and
only
slight
lacing
a
sweet
malt
smell
almost
fruity
a
little
too
much
malt
in
my
opinion
for
a
dunkelwiesse
a
chewy
mouth
feel
with
excellent
carbonation
and
a
very
slight
bitter
aftertaste
grassy
overall
a
beer
worth
trying
but
that
slight
aftertaste
hold
it
back
from
being
a
very
good
beer
d
this
was
a
wellcrafted
dunkelweizen
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
i
know
i
will
picking
up
a
lot
of
these
in
the
future
cloudy
dark
brown
plenty
of
yeast
and
foam
rich
malt
slightly
tart
with
bread
banana
clove
vanilla
richer
mouthfeel
than
the
hefeweizen
as
should
be
expected
very
drinkable
and
a
great
u
s
brewed
example
of
the
style
you
cant
beat
the
pricequality
ratio
of
this
beer
drinkability
along
with
the
hefeweizen
for
a
buck
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
beer
if
you
want
to
pick
up
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
as
far
as
a
domestic
goes
lots
to
admire
here
from
right
out
of
the
fridge
until
room
temperature
and
beyond
at
least
as
far
as
im
concerned
jk
d
very
drinkable
but
not
terribly
exciting
the
dunk
was
dark
as
well
as
more
rich
than
the
bavarian
but
it
did
not
match
the
complexity
of
flavors
at
all
the
taste
is
almost
all
bubblegumdominated
whole
wheat
at
first
the
bubblegum
subsequently
mellows
slightly
to
allow
other
flavours
to
become
more
prominent
but
this
is
mostly
just
the
unpleasantly
tangy
bittersweet
taste
of
damp
whole
wheat
bread
even
so
the
bubblegum
quality
still
stays
too
strong
throughout
as
well
more
fullbodied
than
some
it
has
strong
enough
flavour
but
it
does
not
appeal
to
me
at
all
its
a
schneider
d
honestly
a
pretty
great
beer
from
trader
joes
for
a
decent
price
this
is
one
beer
im
going
to
have
to
pick
up
in
the
future
pulpy

taste
is
slightly

and
has
decent

more
body
than
expected
a
spicy
carbonated
finish
yields
a
bit
of
cinnamon
and
clove
carbonation
is
about
right
given
the
structure
of
the
beer
and
offers
decent
drinkability
though
the
sweetness
may
become
a
bit
too
much
after
a
few
tastes
like
a
nice
accompaniment
to
thanksgiving
dinner
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
medium
head
that
dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
the

surprisingly
good
for

joes
especially
for
this
style
not
on
the
caliber
of
a
weistehephaner
but
far
better
and
more
drinkablepleasurable
than
slam
dunkel
drinkability
not
bad
but
i
do
not
think
i
would
buy
it
again
drinkability
personally
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
at
all
and
was
asked
repeatedly
to
stop
glaring
at
the
bottle
im
glad
unclemattie
dug
it
though
its
not
bland
or
flavorless
but
is
that
the
best
i
can
say
about
this
dunkelweizen
it
just
cant
compete
with
so
many
of
the
germanbrewed
classics
killed
by
stiff
competition
basically
still
amazes
me
that
the
vast
majority
of
u
s
brewers
cant
seem
to
master
the
hefeweizen
style
dunkel
or
otherwise
pours
a
nice
and
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
big
white
head
smells
are
all
over
the
place
a
spicy
yeast
dominates
the
flavor
almost
has
a
rasberry
taste
and
flavor
too
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
the
spicy
yeastiness
is
more
profound
than
alot
of
other
hefes
d
although
it
is
not
super
heavy
i
dont
think
id
drink
it
all
day
but
could
definitely
have
2
or
3
in
a
row
too
sweet
to
be
a
contender
i
wont
be
repurchasing
this
again
aroma
is
very
nice
indeed
some
banana
wheat
and
yeast
taste
has
some
zesty
spice
to
it
in
addition
to
the
banana
cloves
and
wheaty
malt
backing
mouthfeel
is
way
to
thin
but
its
a
drinkable
solid
lager
dability
very
easy
drinking
as
should
be
the
slight
offflavor
copper
penny
is
the
only
item
that
keeps
me
from
giving
this
one
a
major
thumbs
up
but
another
winning
wheat
beer
at
tj
for
about
6six
pack
you
can
do
a
hell
of
a
lot
worse
im
glad
a
company
like
trader
joes
puts
a
style
like
this
on
their
shelves
keep
up
the
good
work
and
spread
the
craft
beer
ive
never
had
this
style
of
beer
before
so
im
not
quite
sure
what
it
is
supposed
to
taste
like
the
look
is
cool
very
cloudy
dark
brown
aromas
are
just
like
any
wheat
beer
with
banana
and
bread
at
the
forefront
there
is
a
slight
roasted
tone
as
well
maybe
thats
the
amber
coming
through
the
flavor
here
is
lacking
however
not
really
a
wheat
and
not
an
amber
with
the
taste
of
neither
the
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
decent
carbonation
not
a
great
beer
maybe
the
properties
of
each
style
cancels
the
other
out
not
recommended
could
not
beat
the
price
so
i
decided
to
buy
one
not
usually
too
big
of
a
fan
of
these
beers
but
this
was
slightly
above
average
possibly
would
drink
again
worth
trying
mostly
because
it
is
so
inexpensive
bought
one
bottle
at
trader
joes
did
not
have
the
foaming
characteristics
of
a
wiehenstephaner
it
did
however
have
that
banana
bread
aroma
and
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
about
the
right
carbonation
but
feels
a
bit
soda
like
not
quite
luxurious
as
the
style
should
have
this
is
a
unique
style
for
a
bargain
beer
very
nice
brew
and
i
will
try
the
others
this
i
will
buy
again
this
beer
was
pretty
decent
but
i
really
dont
think
it
fit
the
dunkelweizen
category
poured
a
cloudy
amber
with
a
nice
bit
of
head
smelled
typical
of
a
weizen
with
clovey
banana
overtones
tasted
like
a
decent
hefeweizen
with
maybe
a
touch
of
roasted
flavors
but
honestly
if
i
wasnt
going
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
them
i
might
not
have
noticed
basically
its
a
nice
tasting
hefeweizen
that
is
darker
for
some
reason
it
really
doesnt
have
enough
dark
malt
flavor
to
be
considered
a
dunkel
but
for
the
price
a
nice
beer
just
think
of
it
as
a
hefe
thanks
for
the
bottle
jen
not
bad
well
worth
the
price
we
paid
the
flavor
could
be
better
but
its
definately
not
without
its
merit
citrusy
wheaty
yeasty
hefe
notes
form
the
backbone
while
a
bit
of
pale
chocolate
and
caramel
malts
add
a
nice
complexity
the
labels
proclaimed
roasted
malts
the
more
i
likes
it
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
though
and
i
find
it
hard
to
have
more
than
one
or
two
wedgefeb
03
especially
for
the
price
from
the
hefe
bottoms
up
overall
a
very
solid
dunkelweizen
just
like
i
like
my
women
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
sienna
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
orange
zest
sweet
toffee
clove
and
light
banana
peel
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
more
clove
and
hints
of
light
black
pepper
cinnamon
and
vanilla
bean
coming
in
for
some
added
complexity
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
sortakinda
grainy
feel
and
a
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
dweizen
one
that
doesnt
overdo
it
on
the
yeast
character
but
also
maintains
a
nice
level
of
spice
and
whatnot
good
times
in
the
world
of
dunkelweiss
yeast
is
king
i
wasnt
able
to
detect
too
much
of
the
german
hefe
yeast
that
i
so
desired
a
bit
muted
but
a
tasty
beer
nonetheless
the
dark
malts
were
not
too
pronounced
almost
true
to
a
german
warsteiner
in
that
both
are
black
without
tasting
very
black
at
all
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
yeasty
dark
malt
wheatiness
from
this
beer
an
appoachable
beer
for
the
style
o
pretty
standard
imo
there
was
nothing
that
stood
out
but
it
didnt
falter
in
any
way
besides
the
look
o
not
a
bad
beer
solid
rendition
of
a
style
we
dont
see
everyday
certainly
not
award
worthy
but
one
of
their
better
beers
very
drinkable
if
not
a
touch
sweet
overall
loved
it
it
had
a
smooth
texture
that
enhanced
the
subtly
of
the
flavors
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
or
take
some
home
in
a
growler
its
a
good
dark
wheat
to
enjoy
in
a
session
from
tap
at
the
brewpub
poured
into
a
traditional
weizen
glass
pours
a
cloudy
light
brown
with
a
quickly
disappearing
head
with
some
lace
smells
of
yeast
citrus
and
malt
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
but
a
little
more
wheatyeast
spice
than
what
was
found
in
the
nose
very
fresh
tasting
and
slightly
effervescent
with
full
body
mouth
feel
too
drinkable
very
refreshing
i
can
see
why
this
is
an
award
winning
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
medium
bodied
the
wheat
and
yeast
give
it
a
creamy
fullness
a
very
refreshing
dunkelweizen
mouth
feel
is
smooth
with
slightly
above
medium
body
despite
the
good
body
to
this
beer
it
doesnt
seem
to
take
up
much
stomach
space
i
ate
alot
while
drinking
probably
about
24
oz
the
taste
is
delicious
but
possibly
easy
to
over
power
with
food
for
piece
this
is
a
win
and
for
the
style
im
going
to
have
to
try
more
of
these
but
i
think
im
a
fan
additional
notes
picked
up
a
growler
togo
and
it
almost
tastes
as
good
from
a
growler
as
it
does
ontap
good
carbonation
and
a
crisp
feel
d
pretty
drinkable
despite
the
few
less
than
perfect
aspects
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
sitting
for
sure
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
again
with
a
proper
pour
as
i
thought
it
was
a
damn
good
tasting
dunkelweizen
all
those
bad
things
aside
had
it
again
about
6
month
later
and
it
didnt
have
as
many
esters
as
it
did
chocolate
more
so
even
than
the
caramel
aroma
drinkability
this
is
milder
than
the
weizenbock
i
know
and
love
but
flavorful
very
high
on
the
session
scale
drinkability
filling
but
ok
d
sweet
spicy
and
slightly
tartthis
is
very
refreshing
heather
says
this
is
very
sessionable
come
on
summer
served
in
a
weizen
glass
this
was
a
deep
ruby
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
lacing
was
ridiculously
thick
and
clingy
smell
was
of
dark
roasted
malts
hiding
some
floral
notes
this
had
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
up
front
and
finshed
crisp
and
clean
hop
presence
is
more
significant
than
typical
for
the
style
but
not
overbearing
the
roastiness
of
the
malts
was
pronounced
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
a
very
sessionable
brew
i
will
visit
piece
again
soon
to
review
the
ontap
version
and
chat
with
the
brewer
excellent
beer
lots
of
flavors
and
clear
to
palate
i
have
yet
to
try
a
noticeably
malty
dunkelweizen
and
paulaner
does
not
break
that
trend
in
my
experience
though
when
a
brewery
offers
both
a
weizen
and
a
dunkelweizen
the
latter
tends
to
be
smoother
and
rounder
with
that
in
mind
paulaners
is
quite
enjoyable
the
yeasty
tartness
is
rather
prominent
but
backed
up
well
enough
by
the
other
elements
not
to
ruin
the
experience
its
ok
taste
is
not
so

like
it

than
one
to
be
sure
about
it
overall
not
a
bad
brew
this
is
one
i
would
give
a
rookie
beer
drinker
who
never
had
grerman
brews
but
i
personally
have
never
been
a
paulaner
fan
very
smooth
and
mild
tasting
which
only
gets
better
as
one
consumes
i
believe
i
paid
1
euro
for
this
12
pint
beer
o
smooth
creamy
light
and
delicious
mild
hefe
tastes
and
somewhat
the
texture
of
a
cappuccino
refreshing
and
beautifully
dark
i
prefer
more
flavour
but
really
like
this
one
for
what
it
is
would
go
well
with
chocolate
as
a
summer
sipper
chocolate
based
dessert
o
a
very
balanced
beer
not
too
watery
and
not
too
heavy
but
exactly
in
the
middle
experience
a
very
good
beer
with
a
real
soul
this
beer
pours
a
nice
medium
dark
brown
with
a
medium
head
it
smells
of
fruit
and
spice
it
tastes
of
fine
maltsfruity
and
spicy
it
is
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
its
color
is
nice
but
i
expected
a
yeast
haze
that
i
did
not
get
perhaps
it
was
just
all
stuck
to
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
definatly
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
hefe
like
its

the
dunkelweizen
is
one
to
respect
one
to
try
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
but
not
the
best
of
the
style
othis
was
a
fairly
simple
beer
the
flavors
were
not
unpleasant
but
were
just
middle
of
the
road
in
both
character
and
complexity
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
carbonation
and
a
touch
of
citrus
flavor
or
something
else
to
liven
things
up
tastes
reminded
me
of
ciders
with
some
caramel
and
hints
of
plums
though
not
overly
sweet
here
the
yeast
is
also
a
key
player
citric
taste
more
lime
than
orange
slightly
bitter
and
a
bit
toasted
interesting
beer
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
high
to
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
the
result
is
a
beer
that
is
slightly
fizzy
but
quickly
calms
to
a
foamy
creamy
generally
smooth
mouthfeel
modest
wheat
twangtartness
from
midpalate
onwards
finish
is
dry
with
some
residual
stickiness
across
the
palate
quite
up
to
style
and
rather
satisfying

smooth
and

good
but
not
that
great
however
indeed
a
worthy
pick
eminent
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
it
o
this
might
not
be
the
most
flavourful
weissbier
dunkel
but
its
probably
my
favourite
i
love
its
smoothness
and
its
great
sessionability
its
a
shame
i
cant
get
it
in
my
region
overall
it
was
great
very
refreshing
and
went
well
with
some
curry
wurst
dear
mom
i
had
a
paulaner
dunkelweizen
today
its
the
5th
wheat
beer
that
ive
had
in
two
days
i
am
oding
on
the
banana
clove
thing
mom
i
cant
feel
it
no
more
the
beer
looked
like
rust
coloured
gravy
with
coagulated
whipped
egg
on
top
i
didnt
wanna
do
it
mom
but
i
had
no
other
choice
it
smelled
totally
generic
for
the
style
also
of
spoilt
dough
wafting
with
spent
yeast
tasted
just
like
the
other
four
id
had
sweet
sour
fizzy
caramelite
not
bad
mom
but
just
that
i
wanted
it
no
more
i
like
paulaner
beers
mom
but
it
was
the
right
thing
at
the
wrong
time
im
sorry
mom
but
i
will
wean
off
wheat
for
a
while
and
come
back
again
come
back
and
do
justice
to
paulaner
hefe
dunkel
overy
easy
to
drinkbut
must
admitit
hits
you
in
the
head
very
fast
neverlessyou
could
drink
it
all
day
after
many
lagers
here
in
china
a
grocery
store
had
some
more
interesting
beers
paulaner
dunkel
weiss
was
kind
of
a
disappointment
though
i
like
their
hefe
and
was
hoping
for
a
yeasty
flavored
treat
but
the
yeast
flavors
took
a
back
seat
to
the
wheat
in
this
beer
still
pretty
decent
but
i
probably
wont
have
in
a
bottle
again
maybe
on
tap
od
i
could
have
a
few
but
it
was
nothing
overly
special
interesting
dunkelweisse
overall
although
it
provided
some
refreshment
this
beer
seemed
a
bit
boring
and
disappointing
to
some
extent
pours
hazy
brown
with
a
large
lasting
head
nose
shows
lots
of
doughy
wheat
caramelised
bananas
and
spicy
phenols
similar
flavours
mainly
doughy
wheat
with
soft
toasty
malt
also
joining
in
quite
light
very
easy
to
drink
carbonation
is
moderately
high
which
suits
the
flavours
well
d
very
nice
easy
drinker
could
go
through
quite
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
d
very
very
drinkable
the
taste
of
bread
makes
it
heavy
however
the
banana
and
citruses
makes
it
fresh
and
easy
and
it
has
not
so
high
abv
so
very
drinkable
drinkability
i
am
savoring
all
of
this
bottle
but
it
feels
so
filling
that
i
dont
think
i
want
more
than
one
in
a
session
easy
to
drink
but
0
5l
is
plenty
for
me
d
wonderfully
consumable
i
could
down
glass
after
glass
but
im
not
particularly
sure
why
id
want
to
a
very
wellmade
beer
but
kind
of
boring
and
nothing
special
still
a
recommended
dunkel
if
youre
in
the
bavarian
neighbourhood
d
quite
drinkable
not
exciting
in
any
way
but
certainly
pleasing
this
is
a
decent
dunkelweizen
though
it
lacks
a
bit
of
character
ill
reach
for
the
more
interesting
paulaner
hefeweizen
naturtrüb
next
time
overall
a
delicious
summer
beer
with
a
hint
of
fruits
and
very
refreshing
overall
a
great
smooth
beer
perfectly
enjoyable
by
itself
or
with
a
meal
its
popular
in
oktoberfest
for
a
reason
recommended
d
a
very
nice
dunkelweizen
a
little
of
everything
nice
about
the
style
this
is
a
musttry
a
great
example
of
a
the
style
but
on
the
sweeter
end
that
mutes
a
lot
of
the
other
possible
flavors
nose
of
banana
apple
lemon
and
yeast
and
sweetness
of
wheat
malt
palate
is
wheat
malt
first
then
a
tad
citrus
cleaning
followed
by
other
fruit
and
zest
of
pine
to
clear
the
palate
for
those
that
dont
like
sweet
things
you
may
really
be
disappointed
this
is
not
a
savory
dunkel
hef
and
tastes
a
lot
brighter
and
less
syrup
sweet
on
tap
medium
bodied
and
very
easy
to
drink
cheers
drinkability
personally
i
couldnt
drink
a
12
pack
of
any
dunkelweizen
but
then
who
would
want
to
2
or
three
would
go
down
very
well
with
a
meal
look
copper
color
balanced
foam
of
head
smell
fruity
with
spices
invites
you
to
drink
it
taste
sweet
and
sour
something
like
tamarind
mouthfeel
citrus
and
refreshing
high
carbonation
and
medium
body
drinkability
i
really
enjoyed
with
my
meal
as
expected
this
beer
is
a
cloudy
dull
brown
there
are
lots
a
chunks
of
various
size
it
also
came
with
2
finger
tan
head
that
dissipated
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
sweet
banana
bread
it
is
a
very
good
hefe
smell
the
taste
is
also
almost
entirely
banana
no
clove
at
all
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
and
smooth
hefe
i
look
forward
to
another
one
of
these
dark
cloudy
chestnut
beer
some
carbonation
at
the
botton
an
offwhite
head
with
staying
power
it
smells
like
plums
and
caramel
and
dark
fruits
all
with
a
smokey
roasted
edge
and
tastes
the
same
very
much
like
a
dark
banana
bread
you
dont
forget
its
a
wheat
beer
and
the
mouthfeel
is
light
maybe
even
a
bit
too
lighti
found
myself
wanting
more
carbonationbut
overall
a
highly
drinkable
beer
would
love
to
try
again
and
could
imagine

excellent

this
is

it
has
nice
complexity
of

and
a
low
abv
that
makes
it
an
easy
drinker
overall
a
solid
discovery
overall
this
is
a
great
representation
of
the
style
it
was
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
though
it
was
perhaps
a
bit
too
sticky
at
the
end
and
the
colour
wasnt
ideal
nontheless
a
complete
pleasure
that
ill
be
having
again
sometime
soon
d
goes
down
nice
good
representation
of

all
i
can
say
is
gimme
more
drinkability
a
solid

and
prbably
the
gold
standard
of

it
smells

bananas

weiss
dunkel
beer
brewered
by
paulaner
this
is
a
decent
dunkel
it
is
a
little
smoky
on
the
aroma
but
well
balanced
a
top
tier
commercial
hefeweizen
see
i
am
looking
forward
to
try
the
aventinus
taste
has
an
average
dose
of
banana
and
clove
layered
on
the
grainy
wheat
backbone
the
dark
malts
add
a
caramel
and
roasty
biscuity
touch
even
some
candisugar
which
obviously
isnt
in
there
the
yeast
is
quite
fruity
and
gives
a
nice
extra
to
the
beer
mouthfeel
is
a
little
sticky
and
somewhat
sweet
a
nice
and
decent
beer
the
aromas
are
of
bananas
cloves
chocolate
wheat
and
caramel
some
other
fruity
aromas
and
flavors
too
on
mouth
feels
pretty
much
like
the
paulaner
weiss
only
a
little
more
bitter
fruity
high
carbonation
wheat
and
malt
tastes
drinkability
is
great
pretty
much
of
an
easygoing
refreshing
beer
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
carbonation
and
the
drinkability
is
really
good
i
would
have
no
problem
enjoying
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
d
drinkability
is
fine
but
i
would
want
a
dunkel
with
more
character
franziskaner
and
erdinger
beat
this
one
for
me
no
chocolately
notes
in
taste
as
i
have
experienced
with
other
dunkels
an
average
one
salud
d
not
very
stimulating
but
fairly
drinkable
notes
good
would
have
it
again
looking
at
the
label
of
paulaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
i
noticed
that
it
looks
like
the
bavarian
version
of
the
last
supper
or
last
jug
it
pours
in
a
nice
amber
color
with
12
fingers
of
foam
and
smells
like
dark
bread
the
first
taste
is
of
sweet
bread
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
the
bottle
i
had
was
too
carbonated
which
gave
it
a
bad
mouthfeel
blocking
the
tastes
all
and
all
i
have
had
many
better
weissbiers
one
of
the
better
weizens
that
i
have
come
across
when
i
was
in
germany
this
was
my
go
to
beer
at
all
the
places
i
went
in
bavaria
simply
amazing
i
brought
a
couple
bottles
back
and
waited
a
few
months
to
taste
them
again
and
the
flavor
had
definitely
mellowed
and
lost
a
lot
of
its
flavor
still
an
amazing
beer
that
its
a
shame
they
dont
export
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
germany
pours
cloudy
brown
with
an
enormous
offwhite
head
intense
banana
aroma
with
notes
of
caramel
toffee
chocolate
and
cloves
refreshing
hefeweissbier
flavour
with
some
extra
notes
of
malts
and
dark
bread
but
lightbodied
if
blindfolded
i
might
mistake
the
flavour
for
a
pale
hefe
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
beer
as
one
of
my
regulars
fresh
smooth
not
very
complex
just
roast
and
chocolate
malt
aroma
and
chocolate
malttaste
medium
satisfying
mouthfeel
great
after
sushi
with
wasabi
and
ginger
pure
brown
lace
dry
aftertaste
some
malt
banana
and
citrus
bit
of
yeast
well
carbonated
thanks
mark
for
bringing
back
from
germany
will
be
interested
to
try
other
examples
of
this
style
this
is
not
the
best
dw
i
have
ever
had
but
it
was
worth
the
money
and
definitely
worth
another
try
a
beautiful
brown
copper
color
the
dense
foamy
head
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
collar
carbonation
wasnt
as
high
as
i
expected
very
enjoyable
smell
sweet
wheat
and
and
yeast
some
nice
roasted
aspects
too
i
enjoy
the
malts
and
the
way
they
are
balanced
the
darker
malts
take
off
from
the
beers
refreshing
aspect
but
maybe
add
some
complexity
to
the
brew
the
wheat
is
less
noticeable
than
in
non
dunkel
hefe
weizen
but
some
citric
aspects
still
appear
a
good
beer
but
i
expected
more
of
my
first
dunkel
hefeweizen
joey
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amber
colour
into
the
glass
with
alot
of
foam
like
all
weissbier
it
has
a
mild
smell
of
yeast
and
malt
maybe
some
hint
of
citrus
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
you
can
also
feel
a
little
bitterness
in
the
after
taste
a
good
beer
but
not
as
good
as
the
naturtrüb
unbalanced
toward
sweet
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
citrus
bitterness
bitterness
coaxed
out
with
sliver
of
lemon
slightly
roasted
flavor
with
hints
of
clove
and
vanilla
very
refreshing
this
dunkel
is
pretty
similar
to
the
hefeweissbier
naturtrub
it
pours
a
dark
honey
colour
with
a
thick
white
foam
head
the
smell
is
slightly
perceptible
but
it
previews
the
soft
woody
flavour
with
a
very
slight
bitterness
it
has
a
full
body
another
good
beer
by
paulaner
although
not
top
notch
pours
a
deep
golden
colour
and
is
very
murky
the
head
is
limited
but
what
there
is
does
sit
there
for
the
duration
as
for
the
taste
it
leaves
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
wheat
beer
with
after
taste
the
body
is
full
really
does
nothing
for
me
but
then
again
is
not
my
style
of
choice
pours
a
cloudy
light
amber
color
huge
frothy
off
white
head
that
lasts
fruity
spicy
aromas
of
apple
caremel
and
bananas
sweet
fruity
wheat
and
caremel
flavors
very
spicy
and
yeasty
medium
body
and
has
a
soft
and
creamy
and
somewhat
watery
mouthfeel
very
light
and
drinkable
i
will
have
to
try
another
bottle
of
this
yummy
little
dark
wheat
lots
of
banana
clove
wheat
of
course
and
chocolate
very
smooth
aswell
nice
appearance
deepish
brown
with
a
big
rocky
frothy
head
classic
aroma
if
nothing
more
thin
overcarbed
and
im
missing
all
those
fruity
esters
almost
a
weizen
with
food
colouring
and
even
then
not
a
great
one
a
subpar
example
of
the
style
3
5
served
from
2
yr
old
bottle
into
hefe
glass
i
was
anticipating
some
clumping
of
yeast
due
to
being
in
cellar
but
was
fine
pours
a
nice
reddish
brown
with
plenty
carbonation
and
nice
creamy
head
smell
of
fruitiness
with
banana
tastes
much
like
smell
with
some
malt
insets
and
other
fruit
fruitiness
with
malty
biscuit
following
and
a
slight
happiness
bite
on
back
end
comes
together
very
well
with
smooth
feel
a
very
good
dunkle
hefe
a
favorite
for
sure
a
solid
tasty
dunkelweizen
well
balanced
bready
yeasty
creamy
and
delicious
my
only
complaint
is
the
banana
flavor
is
a
bit
muted
o
it
is
worth
trying
if
you
are
a
weizen
fan
i
will
likely
have
this
one
again
overall
disappointing
the
krystalweizen
was
the
big
winner
between
the
three
tuchers
tonight
and
it
wasnt
even
close
its
good
but
nowhere
close
to
great
and
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
o
very
drinkable
not
too
much
clove
or
banana
overall
this
is
pretty
average
for
the
style
its
a
nice
affordable
quaff
for
sure
though
solid
dunkleweizen
and
another
warm
day
refresher
overall
a
fairly
hefe
heavy
dunkel
weizen
the
malt
character
is
pretty
much
overshadowed
by
the
wheat
citrus
and
spice
characteristics
this
is
a
beer
with
great
appearence
pours
a
nice
brown
dark
honey
color
head
is
big
creamy
beige
in
color
with
low
retention
lacing
is
medium
carbonation
high
it
has
some
sediment
at
the
bottom
og
the
glass
it
is
a
nice
thirst
quencher
with
dry
taste
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
puffy
light
beige
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
random
chunks
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
some
sketchy
looking
chunks
of
sediment
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
after
the
pour
smell
is
of
dark
wheat
burnt
caramel
and
some
off
metallic
notes
taste
is
the
same
with
some
subtle
banana
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
dunkelweizen
with
some
weird
stuff
going
on
for
a
dark
hefe
it
is
pretty
good
ive
had
better
of
course
but
id
definately
drink
this
again
looing
forward
to
try
another
one
os
tucher
brews
generally
slightly
above
average
very
bready
with
less
emphasis
on
the
esters
and
phenols
a
little
plain
not
really
what
im
looking
for
in
a
dunkelweiss
but
i
could
see
how
some
prefer
this
nice
presentation
in
my
stemmed
pint
tulip
bold
hazy
brown
with
lots
of
stuff
floating
around
rocky
head
with
nice
lacing
like
a
meal
in
a
beer
smell
is
good
and
fruity
and
a
bit
malty
tastes
great
but
not
less
filling
wheaty
sweet
and
a
little
fruity
like
a
peach
marmalade
on
wheat
toast
mouthfeel
is
great
a
medium
bodied
jefe
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
well
worth
looking
for
again
also
sessionable
if
you
dontind
the
caloric
value
cheers
btw
i
poured
most
of
it
in
the
glass
and
then
rolled
the
last
ounce
or
two
around
the
bottom
to
loosen
up
the
yeast
for
the
final
pour
didnt
want
to
waste
the
bonus
on
the
bottom
another
great
tucher
m
nice
mouthfeel
it
is
simple
but
nice
not
to
bitter
nor
too
sweet
t
the
same
way
as
the
smell
very
refreshing
medium
body
chewy
and
long
lasting
end
d
this
one
is
a
little
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
the
summer
but
i
think
this
might
be
preferable
during
the
colder
months
of
the
year
overall
drinkability
worst
ive
had
in
style
flavorless
bodyless
the
high
point
is
the
appearance
not
a
bad
beer
just
horrible
in
style
if
bmc
made
a
hefelite
this
would
be
it
delicious
and
enjoyable
easy
drinking
it
is
a
decent
franconian
dunkelweizen
but
not
amazing
edit
had
to
go
back
and
rethink
my
scores
after
this
beer
warmed
so
nicely
i
thought
it
was
good
to
begin
with
but
after
its
finished
i
think
its
excellent
o
this
is
a
solid
brew
but
it
shows
more
characteristics
with
a
begian
dubbel
than
a
dunkel
because
the
yeast
is
a
bit
underplayed
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
which
seems
proper
its
not
quite
as
crisp
as
a
great
hefe
but
enough
with
enough
of
a
smoothness
to
the
body
to
make
for
pleasant
drinking
it
gets
pretty
filling
without
quite
going
too
far
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
active
and
a
tough
rough
a
bit
gassy
overall
the
least
favorite
of
the
tucher
brews
that
ive
tried
drinks
pretty
easy
i
was
expecting
more
from
this
one
given
how
good
the
kristall
was
the
other
night
luckily
the
amount
of
sediment
and
hairy
appearance
dont
affect
drinkability
or
flavor
otherwise
this
beer
wouldve
been
a
lost
cause
head
city
frothy
light
brown
lasts
for
days
even
lace
but
little
cling
color
is
a
31
on
the
srm
chart
very
fragrant
smells
of
banana
cloves
wheat
citrus
lots
of
malt
and
vanilla
tastes
that
i
recognize
are
banana
wheat
clove
rye
chocolate
malt
and
a
little
pepper
plenty
of
body
here
for
my
mouth
good
carbonation
and
creaminess
great
flavor
and
body
a
good
beer
to
drink
again
poured
this
beer
out
into
my
wheat
glass
out
of
a
500ml
bottle
poured
out
with
a
silky
creamy
white
head
the
body
of
the
beer
is
a
deep
mahogany
with
less
carbonation
then
the
other
tucher
wheats
smells
like
bananas
and
grain
tastes
like
bana
bread
with
a
more
hoppy
feel
very
bready
and
grassy
as
well
there
is
more
barley
in
this
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
dry
hop
kick
back
and
and
tingly
carbonation
feel
this
is
drinkable
and
i
can
sit
down
in
a
pub
and
slow
drink
a
few
pretty
decent
for
being
a
dark
wheat
beer
the
carbonation
might
drop
it
down
a
little
but
perhaps
its
because
i
didnt
use
a
weizen
glass
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
got
a
brown
color
like
you
would
find
from
a
newcastle
there
was
a
head
that
dissapated
very
quickly
to
a
thin
white
lace
at
the
top
the
smell
was
a
bit
fruity
with
the
usual
scents
from
a
hefe
the
taste
had
a
bit
of
a
bite
and
a
little
bit
too
much
carbonation
for
me
all
in
all
a
good
brew
that
should
be
enjoyed
on
a
hot
day
enjoy
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
quickly
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
in
one
sitting
drinkability
was
pretty
low
as
having
this
brew
didnt
leave
me
wanting
another
at
all
impressions
definitely
good
although
i
think
some
additional
hoppiness
could
have
balanced
it
nicely
d
excellent
so
enjoyable
and
richly
flavorful
also
very
complementary
to
certain
foods
drinkability
is
much
better
than
i
anticipated
good
change
of
pace
for
wheat
beer
lovers
try
it
in
the
colder
months
as
a
dark
beer
alternative
mfd
a
light
lighterwatery
but
still
overall
a
fine
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
this
is
a
drinkable
dunkel
but
a
bit
too
much
on
the
light
side
for
the
style
goes
down
very
smooth
and
very
easy
overall
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
palate
was
average
at
best
but
the
rest
was
a
good
experience
certainly
a
more
impressive
and
memorable
brew
than
their
helles
hefeweizen
pick
this
one
up
if
you
happen
to
find
it
mouthfeeldrinkability
gassy
and
bellyfilling
the
texture
is
this
beers
achilles
heel
with
just
a
gentle
swish
it
becomes
overbearing
and
quickly
forces
the
mouth
to
contain
all
that
it
holds
as
this
feature
alone
plays
such
a
key
factor
in
enjoying
this
beer
it
is
average
at
best
overall
for
me
d
this
dunkel
lends
itself
well
to
the
drinkability
category
a
good
session
dunkel
disappointing
although
not
undrinkable
i
did
all
the
right
thingsswirled
the
yeast
at
bottom
let
it
warm
up
for
20
minutes
from
the
fridge
served
in
an
authentic
german
hefeweizen
glass
guess
this
one
simply
isnt
a
mindblowing
dunkelweizen
it
happens
drinkability
it
was
enjoyable
to
drink
with
a
nice
taste
easy
drink
good
for
the
100f
weather
which
i
am
sitting
in
now
whatever
cheap
beer
and
better
than
the
9
dollar
pabst
at
the
new
yankee
stadium
fluffernutter
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
while
not
the
best
certainly
a
really
good
beer
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
it
again
m
d
theres
a
little
size
to
the
body
with
an
evenly
balanced
carbonation
followed
with
a
nice
and
smooth
finish
its
not
an
incredibly
intense
brew
and
i
dont
think
thats
the
point
of
it
at
all
easy
drinking
brew
for
an
easy
going
night
mid
sized
bottle
pours
plummy
brown
under
a
huge
frothy
khaki
head
that
stays
and
stays
light
chocolate
and
fruit
in
the
nose
i
get
some
more
chocolate
bananas
light
powdered
sugar
light
toast
and
some
maple
the
problem
i
have
here
is
that
this
one
is
on
the
watery
side
compared
to
the
all
stars
of
the
style
decent
enough
take
on
a
tasty
style
just
thin
body
and
flavor
wise
this
beer
pours
a
earthy
carmel
color
with
a
cloudyhazy
touch
good
head
that
went
away
slowly
no
lacing
strangely
enough
i
couldve
sworn
i
would
have
gotten
some
bananas
jump
right
out
of
the
nose
of
this
beer
also
noteable
are
some
other
spices
clove
in
particular
but
a
very
sweet
scent
almost
a
champagney
kind
of
smell
very
agreeable
the
taste
is
more
bready
banana
spice
giving
way
to
some
nut
flavor
as
the
beer
got
a
little
warmer
mouthfeel
was
light
and
easy
to
drink
not
much
carbonation
here
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
give
this
one
a
shot
its
an
affordable
dunkleweizen
cheers
taste
dark
malts
banana
a
bit
wheaty
at
the
end
mediumtothick
bready
creamy
and
smooth
very
nice
d
this
is
a
bit
of
a
mixed
bag
some
aspects
of
this
beer
were
good
but
when
it
comes
down
to
the
taste
it
was
a
bit
uninteresting
oddly
drinkable
though
d
decent
dunkelweizen
d
a
good
dark
weizen
not
as
good
as
franzikaner
but
a
solid
beer
i
could
have
again
one
of
the
least
expensive
dunkleweisse
beers
around
fullish
in
body
with
great
carbonation
tuchers
dunkle
is
a
fun
and
fruity
take
on
the
style
very
enjoyable
and
highly
drinkable
a
pleasant
traditional
beer
certainly
worth
a
try
flavor
is
balanced
and
mild
a
very
mild
and
easy
to
drink
brew
not
quite
as
full
flavored
or
as
complex
as
i
would
have
hoped
but
not
bad
either
a
good
example
of
the
style
that
make
a
great
sausage
pizza
pairing
a
very
well
done
beer
by
a
respectable
brewer
overall
not
bad
but
cant
compete
with
some
of
the
others
of
the
style
drinkability
i
love
it
i
used
to
drink
tons
of
this
back
in
the
day
md
high
carbonation
as
expected
the
beer
was
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
had
another
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
i
find
it
in
a
beer
store
i
will
definately
be
picking
one
or
more
up
dability
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
just
not
a
great
dunkel
may
simply
not
be
at
the
peak
of
freshness
but
definitely
down
the
list
in
my
personal
dunkelweizen
pecking
order
this
big
bottle
pours
a
murkymuddy
brown
with
a
tall
kakhi
head
that
leaves
behind
some
big
lace
the
smell
is
sweet
like
almond
whiped
cream
if
there
is
such
a
wonderful
thingsome
faint
spice
is
also
notable
lightly
roasted
malts
followed
by
spicy
pepper
and
clove
are
first
to
greet
the
tounge
nutty
flavors
emerge
mid
wayfollowed
by
some
sweet
fruits
and
a
underlying
skunk
that
is
almost
undetectable
the
body
is
medium
to
lightwith
a
tangy
bite
nice
solid
body
and
still
refreshinga
nice
rainy
day
summer
brew
this
is
a
nice
dunkel
however
i
think
mine
may
be
a
little
old
it
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
but
not
as
much
cloudiness
as
i
expected
i
did
swirl
the
bottom
to
get
some
but
it
didnt
come
up
easily
so
it
has
settled
a
long
time
it
smells
a
little
of
banana
but
not
enough
for
the
style
and
no
clove
was
detected
at
all
it
tasted
a
bit
oxidized
but
had
some
nice
wheat
and
yeast
flavor
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
was
dry
and
slightly
acrid
i
think
the
bottle
i
had
was
an
injustice
to
the
tucher
brand
since
ive
been
to
germany
and
i
know
this
would
be
far
better
on
tap
and
fresh
there
if
you
can
find
this
fresh
buy
it
otherwise
dont
waste
your
moneybrew
your
own
very
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
for
all
seasons
d
not
a
bad
brew
being
german
i
have
a
special
place
in
my
heart
for
tucher
this
beer
is
good
but
i
often
dont
go
past
one
500ml
in
a
sitting
enjoy
this
beer
d
outstanding
well
balanced
decently
sessionable
brew
its
lack
of
sweetness
could
make
this
a
very
accessible
weizen
definite
reco
here
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
just
like
dunkels
better
here
is
a
good
example
had
it
in
a
pilsner
glass
chilled
poured
the
usual
pleasent
light
brown
hazy
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
smelled
of
chocolate
yeast
and
hint
of
banana
taste
was
clean
and
smooth
with
some
yeast
in
the
finish
and
chocolate
banana
cherries
and
a
little
spiceyness
in
the
front
its
tooker
body
is
light
and
overly
carbonated
for
my
liking
easy
to
drink
and
nothing
offensive
i
actually
like
the
us
microbrewed
versions
of
this
style
ive
tried
more
than
this
one
the
flavors
seem
to
pop
a
bit
more
drinkability
the
dunkel
hefe
weizens
are
a
more
robust
full
version
of
the
helles
hefe
weizens
and
very
enjoyable
this
bier
is
best
in
the
fall
and
winter
months
where
the
heaviness
and
more
full
taste
works
vs
the
helles
any
considering
it
is
27
degrees
here
in
chicago
i
think
i
will
have
another
i
havent
had
this
bier
much
but
will
more
often
now
a
well
rounded
bier
that
is
very
enjoyable
to
drink
d
this
is
an
okay
hefe
defiantly
not
he
best
in
the
category
but
also
not
the
worst
i
might
get
it
again
but
would
not
rush
out
to
buy
it
md
medium
to
light
bodied
perhaps
a
little
watery
low
carbonation
and
easy
drinking
cant
really
go
wrong
with
a
dunkelweizen
walnut
brown
body
capped
by
a
finger
of
offwhite
head
of
modest
duration
nicely
malted
with
yeasty
overtures
and
caramel
the
taste
follows
suit
impressing
with
the
caramel
and
malt
but
lacking
some
complexity
rather
than
fruited
hints
id
prefer
they
were
more
directly
involved
in
the
taste
the
modest
hop
flavor
could
also
use
an
upgrade
still
its
good
and
smooth
id
like
a
little
more
carbonation
on
this
but
the
texture
atones
its
not
hard
to
knock
down
a
couple
of
these
by
any
means
though
i
certainly
prefer
the
helles
hefe
weizen
this
is
a
solid
smooth
nicetasting
beer
worth
trying
and
returning
to
in
the
future
pours
a
cloudy
dirty
brown
color
with
a
below
average
head
for
a
hefe
though
it
left
a
nice
cap
the
smell
is
quite
nice
clove
and
banana
with
a
light
wheat
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
quite
neutral
it
starts
off
with
some
light
clove
and
banana
flavors
which
are
quickly
offset
with
the
malt
presence
leaving
quite
a
neutral
brew
there
is
a
slightly
tart
apple
skin
presence
as
well
the
feel
is
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
finishes
neutral
a
very
easy
drinking
brew
could
use
some
more
hefe
phenol
flavor
but
a
nice
enjoyable
brew
d
i
think
i
would
get
this
again
good
taste
and
pretty
smooth
i
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
oh
ya
very
easy
to
drink
not
strong
or
overpowering
just
pretty
good
for
the
money
an
average
dunkel
i
would
definately
drink
it
again
i
dont
think
i
could
drink
many
in
a
sitting
because
of
the
fruitiness
d
the
flavor
is
a
bit
light
but
there
are
nice
toasted
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
the
overall
impression
was
that
it
is
a
bit
dull
d
poor
for
some
reason
this
stuff
is
just
not
sitting
right
with
me
it
seems
all
out
of
whack
i
probably
wont
buy
this
again
but
i
may
try
to
buy
another
bottle
to
see
if
freshness
was
a
negative
factor
with
this
sample
there
is
not
freshness
date
and
ive
only
had
the
bottle
in
the
frige
for
maybe
two
weeks
not
the
most
complex
or
tasty
dunkles
hefe
weizen
but
it
certainly
gets
the
job
done
and
is
quite
tasty
drinkability
a
really
great
dunkles
hefe
weizen
very
pleasant
complexity
and
tasty
flavors
refreshing
and
delicious
overall
my
sample
was
a
solid
dark
wheat
brew
but
a
bit
underwhelming
in
the
taste
department
this
ones
worth
revisiting
at
a
future
date
to
see
if
i
got
a
bad
bottle
d
wonderful
brew
as
usual
from
tucher
ill
be
going
back
to
the
well
for
this
one
this
summer
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkel
a
nice
dried
fruit
flavor
mixed
with
a
sweet
taste
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
some
amber
hues
aroma
is
cloves
overripe
bananas
and
yeast
the
smell
reminds
me
of
banana
nut
bread
the
taste
a
nice
malty
flavor
with
plenty
of
yeast
and
a
touch
of
banana
overall
this
is
a
good
brew
that
i
would
not
mind
having
again
medium
body
with
a
moderately
mild
abv
this
is
a
good
solid
easy
drinkin
dunkel
thats
certainly
worth
a
try
its
from
germany
go
figure
the
taste
is
clean
and
particularly
quenching
even
for
the
style
firm
malt
backbone
with
ample
carbonation
and
tasty
no
nonsense
finish
and
aftertaste
this
goes
down
very
clean
and
natural
tasting
very
pleasing
and
drinkable
and
almost
textbook
for
the
style
overall
the
aromas
and
flavors
are
all
in
check
but
it
feels
like
somebody
threw
perrier
in
my
beer
blech
overall
a
delicious
beer
dunkels
are
so
much
better
than
regular
hefes
and
this
is
my
new
favorite
dunkel
tucher
dunkles
hefe
weizen
pours
a
caramel
brown
with
a
huge
off
white
head
from
a
brown
one
pint
one
ounce
bottle
the
aroma
has
a
hint
of
cloves
but
way
toned
town
from
what
i
expect
in
a
normal
nondunkel
hefe
it
has
a
smooth
mouthfeel
there
is
a
good
amount
of
malt
and
clove
in
the
taste
pretty
good
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
22
ounce
bottle
into
pilsner
glass
good
appearance
with
a
light
brown
body
and
thick
offwhite
head
good
wheaty
aroma
and
a
long
smooth
finish
not
a
bad
wheat
beer
especially
on
a
hot
summers
night
however
i
prefer
the
helles
to
the
dunkel
in
the
tucher
hefe
weizen
line
gulp
gulp
the
buttery
diacetyl
compound
is
unusual
in
the
style
but
i
link
it
up
to
the
slight
vanillalike
or
almondlike
taste
that
can
add
beneficial
complexities
but
the
diacetyl
here
interferes
with
the
mouthfeel
and
brings
rise
to
the
light
taste
of
paper
and
stale
breads
this
is
likely
not
the
most
fresh
version
of
the
beer
not
knowing
the
stability
of
the
bottles
im
not
sure
about
how
much
of
the
taste
is
brewhouse
or
old
product
a
solid
beer
im
a
bigger
fan
of
the
style
than
most
though
drinkability
while
this
beer
is
quite
good
i
think
i
would
prefer
it
paired
with
some
bold
german
food
of
course
in
such
a
situation
the
flavors
of
the
food
would
dominate
and
the
beer
would
serve
as
a
tasty
means
to
wash
it
down
the
mouth
is
inviting
and
brisk
extremely
easy
drinker
well
worth
searching
out
clean
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
well
done
easy
to
drink
however
some
what
of
a
bland
beer
i
should
try
to
find
a
dunkles
hef
on
tap
somewhere
just
excellent
a
smooth
lightly
carbonated
brew
medium
bodied
with
a
touch
of
tangy
hops
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
at
first
sip
then
it
just
folds
into
all
the
other
flavors
in
the
aftertaste
vey
nice
pour
me
another
please
drinkability
is
good
not
the
best
german
version
ive
had
but
not
a
dud
either
this
beer
poured
to
a
rootbeer
looking
dark
with
a
large
dense
billowy
head
that
is
offwight
the
smell
is
like
banana
oil
when
i
drink
it
its
like
nothing
ive
ever
tasted
before
its
delicious
but
its
hard
to
qualify
very
very
slight
roasted
malt
flavor
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
the
hops
is
in
perfect
balance
the
initial
taste
is
ready
for
this
rootbeer
candy
the
wheat
yeast
starts
to
become
aparent
on
the
front
of
your
tongue
as
the
brew
gets
warmer
its
funky
but
not
at
all
unpleasant
unique
delicious
and
so
refreshing
that
in
your
bones
it
feels
like
drinking
a
lager
if
i
were
to
drink
this
in
a
cozy
bar
with
good
friends
this
beer
would
quickly
become
galvanized
in
my
memory
as
associated
with
happiness
recommended
very
pleasant
but
i
could
tell
it
wasnt
uber
fresh
would
love
to
be
able
to
make
it
to
germany
someday
and
try
one
of
these
on
tap
close
to
the
brewery
tucher
dunkles
hefe
weizen
is
a
damn
good
dunkel
weizen
its
more
than
solid
across
the
board
and
is
at
least
as
drinkable
as
its
better
known
competitors
as
late
summer
gives
way
to
crisp
autumn
ill
be
sure
to
purchase
a
few
bottles
of
this
beer
along
with
my
favorite
oktoberfests
drinkability
is
very
good
a
bit
different
from
other
dunkel
weizens
ive
tried
definitely
worth
a
try
overall
a
bland
and
disappointing
entry
even
franzy
dunkel
is
better
and
thats
not
saying
too
much
if
i
found
this
one
ontap
or
found
a
good
price
on
a
sixpack
i
might
buy
it
again
im
not
sorry
i
bought
this
one
as
a
sampler
but
the
overall
quality
of
this
beer
leads
me
to
the
opinion
that
its
probably
not
as
good
as
id
like
it
to
be
pours
a
hazy
light
amber
brown
color
with
a
thinning
head
that
never
quite
goes
away
aroma
of
strong
malts
with
some
bananas
taste
is
pretty
good
decent
balance
between
sweet
caramel
malt
yeast
fruit
and
very
slight
hops
finish
has
some
sweet
malt
bananas
and
toasted
flavors
mouthfeel
is
about
average
for
the
style
good
dunkel
for
the
price
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
an
excellent
dunkel
style
beer
i
am
usually
not
too
big
on
the
style
but
i
will
be
purchasing
more
of
this
an
ok
drinkable
brew
i
expected
more
maltiness
from
this
it
is
ok
but
i
would
pick
a
stronger
flavored
beer
if
i
had
the
choice
overall
the
third
of
the
tucher
brews
that
i
have
tried
to
date
all
have
been
well
above
average
offerings
worth
trying
a
dependable
teutonic
brew
overall
an
easy
drinking
dunkleweizen
thats
got
a
nice
taste
profile
and
has
a
clean
fluffy
feel
another
good
effort
by
tucher
a
pleasant
enough
example
of
the
style
though
a
bit
bland
light
in
body
even
for
the
style
light
in
flavor
all
around
drinkable
for
certain
and
its
generally
pleasant
just
a
bit
blah

into

is
just
a

the

even
just
a
bit
of

aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
light
and
slightly
sweet
with
more
caramel
coming
through
a
hint
of

and

well
the

nice

good
the
nose
is

malty

the
flavor
is
just
not
quite
as
different
from
a
hefe
as
i
would
want
there
is
a
little
more
malt
flavor
but
still
not
quite
as
different
as
i
want
its
nicely
thick
and
smooth
drinkability
is
high
but
i
like
this
style
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
that
lacks
some
of
the
complexity
of
my
favorite
dunkels
that
being
said
im
still
pretty
satisfied
with
this
beer
and
would
drink
it
again
wow
i
really
liked
this
beer
cant
ad
much
to
what
jason
said
on
his
review
it
poured
a
clear
rusty
brown
smal
frothy
head
that
lasted
throughtout
nice
lacing
too
the
smell
was
pegged
as
ripe
banana
with
a
sweet
bread
and
spicey
note
the
taste
was
delicatable
caramel
apple
banana
malty
bready
you
name
it
i
think
i
like
this
one
better
than
the
weihenstephaner
great
mouthfeel
smooth
and
chunky
at
the
same
time
i
wish
i
had
more
of
these
alas
its
back
to
the
beer
store
pours
a
paler
copper
color
with
a
big
tan
head
in
the
weizen
glass
some
husky
dark
wheat
malt
aromas
as
well
as
some
fruity
yeast
notes
a
slight
bit
diluted
in
flavor
i
guess
i
expected
a
fuller
body
than
what
i
received
because
it
seems
a
little
thin
medium
carbonation
basically
a
pretty
boring
dunkelweizen
ill
have
to
give
it
another
try
sometime
because
i
seem
to
have
enjoyed
many
of
tuchers
other
brews
a
nice
example
of
a
dark
wheat
beer
and
highly
recommended
the
dunkel
pours
an
amberbrown
with
some
sizeable
head
formation
its
attractive
and
offers
a
seductive
roasted
grain
aroma
the
flavors
while
not
as
complex
as
some
dunkels
provide
some
interesting
notes
to
support
this
drinkable
and
medium
bodied
beer
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
wheat
scent
with
the
addition
of
some
crystal
malts
for
a
dark
malt
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
yet
mildly
malty
flavor
with
a
wheaty
finish
and
a
fruity
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
a
good
dunkel
but
ive
had
better
it
has
adequate
malty
flavor
and
a
nice
wheat
taste
a
fine
sessions
brew
when
poured
the
color
was
a
hazy
weak
looking
brown
that
just
lack
depth
in
color
the
smell
was
of
a
mild
aroma
of
spice
and
malts
nothing
outstanding
just
an
average
aroma
the
taste
was
disappointing
it
had
a
bitterness
that
was
a
little
overpowering
for
a
dunkel
and
there
was
also
a
sour
feel
in
the
mouth
and
palate
that
was
a
turn
off
also
there
was
no
after
taste
to
speak
of
and
to
me
just
a
turn
off
another
good
offering
from
tucher
a
little
more
subtle
than
the
julius
echter
and
the
weihenstephan
that
i
followed
it
with
but
real
nice
just
the
same
impressive
pour
goes
down
incredibly
easy
i
wish
i
could
regularly
find
the
bajuvator
as
that
is
quite
a
beer
this
one
would
certainly
be
worth
trying
for
the
dunkel
fans
out
there
light
to
medium

very
pleasant
but
a
little

however
very
clean
solid
and
easy
to
drink
cant
go
wrong
with
this
dunkel
drinkability

this
was
a
little
lighter
than
i
normally
like
my
dunkel
weizen
but
all
the
necessary
ingredients
were
there
and
it
went
down
well
good
job
if
you
like
hefe
at
all
i
strongly
advise
you
try
this
it
pours
a
reddish
brown
almost
like
tea
with
a
slightly
carmel
toned
offwhite
head
it
has
the
spiciness
generally
associated
with
hefeweizen
but
keyed
up
just
a
wee
bit
more
than
say
franziskaner
or
weihenstephaner
this
also
seemed
to
leave
a
very
very
faint
trace
of
a
cream
like
aftertaste
in
my
mouth
perhaps
it
was
just
me
nevertheless
i
thought
this
was
a
fantastic
hefeweizen
and
will
most
certainly
buy
it
again
this
ones
a
pretty
nice
solid
brew
appearance
perhaps
isnt
anything
to
write
home
about
perhaps
the
head
being
a
tad
overfizzy
and
dissapearing
quickly
the
smells
nice
sharp
and
clean
like
a
good
weizen
but
with
a
significant
malty
backing
the
taste
is
exactly
where
it
should
be
without
any
bonus
frills
malty
and
with

oz

could
see
carbonation
bubbles
a
great
lasting
head
was
produced
that
was
a
beige
to
tan
color
and
was
thick
and
pillowy
it
created
a
fluffy
lace
as
well
that
was
the
same
consistence
as
the
head
the
aroma
was
on
the
mild
side
noses
of
sweet
and
dark
malts
wheat
grains
cream
and
light
spices
with
banana
were
all
present
the
flavors
seemed
more
pronounced
in
certain
areas
the
malts
were
in
the
forfront
then
flavors
of
wheat
grains
wood
caramel
roasted
nut
banana
and
light
spices
seemed
to
intertwine
the
aftertaste
was
of
light
malt
wood
and
wheat
all
light
the
body
was
light
at
the
start
and
got
slightly
heavier
medium
as
it
warmed
imo
this
is
a
rather
simple
beer
refreshing
but
simple
seemed
to
loose
carbonation
and
become
almost
flat
as
it
came
to
the
finish
an
above
average
beer
that
when
served
cold
seems
to
be
better
then
it
is
warm
pours
a
medium
brown
color
with
a
great
pilloweysticky
headthe
aroma
is
sweet
and
clovey
the
taste
is
real
clovey
with
some
banana
undertones
i
like
the
light
fruity
finishthis
a
real
nice
beeriam
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
because
it
seems
a
little
heavy
to
drink
very
many
pours
a
hazy
brown
amber
with
golden
highlights
at
the
edges
a
heap
of
fluffy
offwhite
foam
tops
it
off
smell
is
highlighted
by
crisp
grains
nothing
remarkable
in
the
nose
but
nothing
offensive
either
taste
is
similarly
hohum
with
a
texture
that
is
light
but
on
account
of
being
somewhat
watery
than
being
crisp
like
other
wheat
beers
some
sweet
malts
up
front
that
fade
to
typical
grain
tastes
and
a
hint
of
light
crispness
at
the
very
end
quite
drinkable
but
there
are
more
interesting
choices
among
hefeweizens
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
medium
head
and
minimal
lacing
on
the
glass
it
has
carbonation
that
stick
all
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
when
poured
looks
great
the
aroma
is
wonderful
reminded
me
of
fruits
and
some
sort
of
nuts
similar
to
newcastle
brown
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
and
fruit
is
evident
here
very
rich
in
flavor
but
extremely
enjoyable
the
taste
doesnt
really
remind
me
of
a
wheat
weiss
beer
as
it
says
on
the
label
but
its
a
great
tasting
beer
either
way
initial
pour
yielded
a
huge
wite
head
with
small
to
medium
bubles
that
immediately
filled
my
glass
to
the
point
of
overflowing
just
perfect
its
aroma
was
hard
to
distinguish
almost
nonexistant
very
faint
smell
of
its
malt
its
body
is
a
nice
carame
brown
not
quite
opaque
with
the
yeast
visibly
floating
around
very
little
carbonation
on
the
tongue
and
a
mild
initail
taste
as
i
stopped
to
right
this
article
the
alcohol
feeling
started
to
hit
a
good
sign
of
a
nice
beer
it
has
a
very
pleesant
taste
that
was
very
much
to
my
liking

is
a
little
on
the
bland
side
for
the
style
not
very
sweet
and
the
banana
isnt
very
noticeable
some
cloves
but
mostly
just
a
slightly
tart
toasted
wheat
flavor
very
smooth
as
it
warms
but
a
little
rough
when
first
poured
not
bad
but
not
overly
impressive
pours
a
very
dark
mahogany
color
with
a
nice
frothy
head
unfortunatly
that
is
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
imo
almost
no
aroma
and
very
very
bland
boring
taste
i
couldnt
wait
to
finsih
this
brew
so
that
i
could
order
some
other
type
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
sizeable
tan
head
which
retains
and
laces
well
the
smell
is
of
faint
clove
and
perhaps
some
banana
and
bread
but
none
come
in
very
prominently
like
other
beers
of
this
style
the
taste
is
somewhat
sweet
at
first
and
features
a
good
deal
of
caramel
malt
the
mouthfeel
on
the
other
hand
is
a
little
watereddown
and
thin
for
the
style
it
does
feature
a
little
carbonation
but
not
enough
for
the
style
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinker
but
could
easily
be
improved
with
some
more
malt
which
would
give
it
a
desireable
fuller
body
still
not
a
bad
beer
murky
light
brown
in
hue
topped
by
a
stiff
and
sticky
light
tan
head
wheat
tartness
and
banana
esters
are
most
prominent
in
aroma
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
toasty
munich
adding
depth
caramel
sweetness
is
perceptible
upfront
yielding
to
mild
roasted
grain
and
light
chocolate
understated
banana
ester
profile
lightly
bodied
for
style
perhaps
even
a
touch
thin
in
mouthfeel

w
lingering
wheat
tartness
and
hints
of
toasted
grain
a
clean
but
unimpressive
dunkelweizen
that
could
use
more
malt
and
yeast
character
its
not
unlike
many
prosaic
us
microbrewed
versions
had
this
yesterday
at
a
restaurant
called
the
austrian

a

though
this
went
pretty
well
with

overall
this
was
an
enjoyable
brew

with

the
head
settled
slowly

evenly
very

filled
up

i
guess
my
nose
doesnt
register
the
bananas
i
nver
get
that
but
i
can
see
candied
apples
pears

very
full

fresh

tastes
are
dominated
by
the
sweet

after
the
rich

the
feel
is
somewhat
thinner
than
expected
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
doughy
taste
for
the
color
and
smell

overall
very

abv
im
still
looking
for
a
dunkel
weiss
that
has
enough
malt
sweetness
to
balance
out
the
tart
finish
associated
with
this
style
except
for
a
lucky
batch
of
homebrew
i
have
yet
to
find
it
this
is
a
quality
weissbier
no
doubt
but
to
my
taste
still
lacking
as
a
dunkel
first
is
the
very
foamy
head
but
it
quickly
goes
and
this
dunkle
is
very
drinkable
abv
is
5
3
but
pound
down
a
few
of
these
1
pint
and
you
will
notice
not
as
dark
as
some
dunkel
weizens
but
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
flavor
all
the
classic
hefe
flavors
with
a
little
added
malt
character
a
pleasure
to
look
at
when
poured
into
proper
glassware
tuchers
kristall
is
a
hard
act
to
follow
and
this
dunkel
did
a
pretty
fair
job
substantial
bannan
esters
which
are
pretty
well
integrated
in
the
balance
overall
a
tasty
dunkel
but
seemed
like
it
needed
just
a
little
more
kick
to
in
order
to
be
outstanding
im
always
impressed
by
tucher
brews
and
this
one
is
no
different
a
very
crisp
and
flavourful
dunkeles
hefe
i
highly
recommend
pouring
the
beer
leaving
a
bit
in
the
bottle
then
rolling
the
bottle
between
your
hands
to
losen
the
yeast
and
pour
it
into
the
glass
youll
gain
much
more
flavour
overall
fun
take
on
the
style
id
easily
drink
this
again
o
tasty
and
silky
really
enjoyed
this
overall
a
very
good
and
interesting
twist
on
a
dunkelweizen
very
good
hef
like
presence
of
bananas
and
bubblegum
with
a
nice
sweet
presence
of
chocolate
solid
dark
lager
from
germany
this
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
color
with
a
thick
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
banana
and
yeast
the
taste
is
sweet
bready
with
a
lingering
tasting
of
some
bread
and
spices
smooth
and
easy
drinking
with
a
malty
finish
a
pleasant
light
dunkelweizen
not
super
complex
but
it
is
not
completely
naked
as
well
well
balanced
nothing
is
really
predominant
here
relatively
to
style
i
wanted
to
make
some
sort
of
blaxploitation
referencejoke
here
but
i
just
couldnt
pull
the
trigger
hashtag
full
disclosure
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
topaz
topped
by
over
a
finger
of
wan
cream
foam
the
nose
comprises
dry
wheat
mild
orange
zest
light
pumpernickel
and
a
pinch
of
cardamom
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
citrus
coming
through
a
bit
stronger
this
is
balanced
though
by
strong
spicy
contingent
mostly
clove
though
with
bits
of
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
in
there
as
well
i
also
get
some
rye
bread
in
the
finish
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
relatively
smooth
feel
overall
a
tasty
and
enjoyable
dunkelweizen
nuff
said
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
medium
to
mediumhigh
levels
of
carbonation
that
are
complementary
for
the
style
the
result
is
a
slightly
fizzy
at
first
then
smoothedout
and
foamy
mouthfeel
closes
dryly
with
a
bit
of
tartness
and
very
minor
stickiness
across
the
palate
o
just
about
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
had
since
i
was
last
in
germany
very
rich
in
character
and
flavorful
a
solid
example
for
anyone
wanting
to
experience
the
style
o
a
beer
certainly
unlike
any
normal
hefe
but
easy
enough
to
drink
nothing
to
die
for
but
a
sessionable
beer
o
thought
i
might
like
it
from
the
smell
and
appearance
nope

this
is
one
of
the
best
dunkel
weizens
ive
tasted
i
have
a
whole
rack
of
twenty
different
dunkels
arriving
on
thursday
lets
see
if
this
one
can
stay
on
top
of
the
heap
worth
trying
if
you
can
find
it
clear

this

d
a

exceedingly
easy
to
drink
wouldnt
hesitate
to
pick
one
of
these
up
drinkability
a
decent
dunkel
i
would
prefer
more
yeasty
character
on
top
of
the
lightly
roasted
malt
backbone
d
not
a
bad
demonstration
of
the
style
and
i
recommend
it
smells
of
bananas
semi
bitter
chocolate
figs
and
spices
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
chocalatey
and
spicy
with
some
bananas
floating
around
its
easy
to
drink
and
lighter
than
most
other
dunkeweizens

tried
its
a

apart
from

one

roasted
nuts
and
a
touch
of
cocoa
ends
on
the
dry
side
overall
a
rather
unoffensive
beer
nothing
real
notable
i
could
see
sessioning
this
one
for
its
easy
going
nature
overall
a
very
solid
dunkelweizen
but
id
still
say
i
prefer
franziskaner
would
glady
drink
this
again
though
d
this
is
a
nice
dunkel
its
light
enough
to
make
for
a
good
session
beer
a
little
extra
complexity
would
have
been
nice
d
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
much
remarkable
about
it
either
i
think
i
would
much
rather
tackle
an
aboveaverage
hefe
than
another
one
of
these
weltenburgers
offerings
with
the
exception
of
their
asam
bock
have
been
a
bit
on
the
disappointing
side
it
is
very
drinkable
it
hit
the
spot
thin
malt
in
the
aroma
pretty
darn
weak
taste
is
better
but
still
on
the
light
side
bits
of
malt
banana
and
clove
dance
slowly
together
as
mentioned
a
lighter
brew
but
still
tasty
and
enjoyable
a
decent
beer
to
try
but
you
can
get
local
dark
wheat
ales
at
a
much
better
price
and
even
tastier
d
the
metallic
aftertaste
makes
this
tough
to
drink
more
than
one
a
bit
strange
for
a
dunkel
weizen
d
very
drinkable
this
is
a
hefe
with
good
depth

not
overwhelming
md
carbonation
is
a
strong
point
fresh
but
not
fizzy
on
top
of
a
moderate
body
and
relatively
soothing

profile
all
in
all
this
is
not
a
strictlyspeaking
delicious
dunkel
weizen
in
any
sense
to
me
but
a
rather
harmonious
and
drinkable
version
worth
revisiting
time
and
again
i
wonder
if
the
oxidisedfruitlike
sour
edge
could
be
milder
if
served
slightly
fresher
the
bottles
on
the

were
fresh
at
the
place
i
bought
this
at
its
generally
hard
to
find
any
lesser
known
german
beers
fresh
on
the
shelf
regardless
of
retailer
many
of
them
are
old
and
possibly
stale

it
didnt

the

followed

leading
to

klosterbrauerei
weltenburgs
biggest
positive
as
a
brewery
is
that
they
dont
brew
anything
that
i
consider
to
be
average
for
the
style
or
below
only
the
doppelbock
and
the
hefe
weizen
have
been
well
above
average
this
dunkel
weizen
is
a
passable
version
that
failed
to
capture
my
fancy
as
well
as
i
thought
it
might
im
still
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
give
it
a
go
and
might
recommend
it
to
those
who
dont
like
a
strong
hefe
presence
in
their
hefes
it
wasnt
bad
to
drink
but
nothing
to
go
out
of
the
way
for
tastes
pretty
good
it
has
all
the
smells
and
flavors
of
a
good
hefe
but
seems
unable
to
pull
it
together
for
a
clean
finish
no
crisp
bitterness
or
any
sort
of
bite
leaves
sort
of
a
flat
sweetness
even
a
bit
of
a
bad
aftertaste
overall
decent
one
of
the
few
german
beers
available
at
the
local
store
ill
definitely
get
this
again

about

a

meaning
that
one
could
see
through

to
the

it

a

saucy
to
me

im
not

i
would
order
another

we

shouldnt
this

have
more

drinkability
this
one
was
unusual
for

but
very

the
purists
will
brand
it
offstyle

should
i
but
a

of
any

more

a

is

in

ill
give

i
was
a
bit
disappointed
with
this
brew
i
was
hoping
that
a
brewery
around
since
1050
a
d
it
said
so
on
the
label
would
have
cracked
the
code
for
a
topnotch
dunkelweiss
too
bad
this
beer
fell
short
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
nice
big
dark
tan
head
that
slowly
subsides
sweet
chocolatey
notes
with
some
very
light
fruit
scents
in
the
aroma
nice
opening
chocolate
flavors
that
soon
begin
to
feel
a
little
watered
down
definitely
a
little
dissappointing
since
ive
tried
others
that
were
very
full
flavored
from
this
brewery
just
very
thing
and
watery
with
no
real
yeast
flavors
and
no
wheaty
graininess
either
thin
and
not
nearly
as
full
in
the
mouth
as
it
should
be
again
dissappointing
i
could
drink
this
beer
but
im
not
sure
why
i
would
want
there
are
some
many
better
tasting
dunkel
weizens
out
there
rjt
overall
not
bad
but
the
lack
of
a
really
good
texture
hurts
this
beer
for
me
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
caramel
dark
fruit
and
spices
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
has
a
better
smell
than
flavor
in
my
opinion
this
beer
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
looks
and
smells
wonderful
but
when
you
taste
it
kinda
falls
flat
not
that
its
not
any
good
just
wish
the
flavor
profile
matched
the
looksmell
o
definitely
a
wildly
uneven
beer
had
some
good
qualities
but
somehow
fell
short
o
the
early
promise
of
the
nose
was
a
letdown
in
the
taste
but
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
the
price
is
a
problem
its
pretty
much
the
most
expensive
dunkelweisse
on
the
shelf
and
its
not
the
best
so
its
hard
to
make
it
a
repeat
buy
even
though
i
like
the
beer
this
was
liquid
apple
pie
brown
pour
nice
head
about
4
finger
in
hef
glass
nose
of
apples
and
hef
yeast
palate
and
feel
is
quite
nice
apples
and
crisp
end
both
dry
from
hopping
and
mineral
with
a
toasty
malt
note
although
once
the
carbonation
goes
its
a
very
plain
drink
first
half
was
better
than
the
second
and
thats
saying
a
long
seeing
a
good
hef
is
for
the
thirsty
nice
medium
brown
pour
with
a
slight
reddish
touch
to
the
sides
yielded
a
nice
head
of
off
white
that
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
fairly
well
as
it
trickled
down
aroma
is
nice
and
earthy
with
touches
of
roasted
nuts
and
caramel
coming
through
as
it
warms
nice
deep
flavor
nothing
over
the
top
but
nice
and
consistent
for
the
style
about
what
i
would
expect
from
them
deep
sweet
malts
are
driven
home
in
the
finish
with
a
long
taste
of
caramel
that
really
just
drives
it
home
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
beer
there
are
many
much
better
options
for
a
dunkel
but
i
dont
think
youd
go
wrong
giving
it
a
try
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
look
and
smell
great
but
when
you
actually
try
to
drink
it
it
leaves
a
bit
to
be
desired
it
pours
a
beautiful
golden
brown
color
has
an
excellent
malty
aroma
as
well
but
when
you
drink
it
the
taste
is
bitter
and
it
is
very
chunky
beer
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
this
one
but
hey
it
could
of
been
alot
worse
this
is
a
very
d
drinkable
beer
and
a
grat
option
for
weiss
drinker
that
want
the
malt
solid
beer
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
goes
down
smoothly
it
is
quite
sessionable
this
was
my
first
hopf
i
will
try
others
mediumbodied
and
kind
of
creamy
its
a
tasty
and
drinkable
dunkel
came
recommended
from
tiffanys
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
i
dont
see
it
around
much
but
it
is
pretty
good
this
beer
was
recommended
to
me
at
bierkraft
in
brooklyn
and
i
must
say
it
does
not
disappoint
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
recommend
it
to
anyone
who
likes
hefeweizens
bought
this
to
compare
it
to
the
franziskaner
dunkelweisse
it
was
served
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
poured
a
cloudy
opaque
browncaramel
color
w
an
offwhite
head
the
smell
was
wheaty
and
even
sour
the
taste
was
clean
and
a
little
sour
the
taste
wasnt
very
impressive
or
complex
i
would
have
almost
said
insipid
but
after
letting
it
warm
a
little
it
gave
more
flavor
it
had
good
drinkability
because
it
was
refreshing
and
not
heavy
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
not
as
nice
as
some
other
dunkelweizens
but
decent
notes
solid
beer
rather
decent
dunkleweisse
but
nothing
special
pours
ark
brown
with
offwhite
head
nose
is
fairly
active
with
some
traditional
bananaclove
of
the
regular
hefe
but
also
some
fresh
baked
brownbread
maltiness
palate
is
somewhat
thin
bodied
but
the
fruity
flavors
come
through
as
well
nothing
spectacular
but
not
worth
passing
up
either
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
thick
billowing
head
really
good
lacing
aroma
is
basically
predominantly
bananna
with
some
roasted
malt
the
body
is
medium
good
carbonation
the
flavor
is
a
combination
of
soft
chocolate
malt
with
wheat
beer
fruitiness
its
very
well
balanced
a
good
dark
wheat
beer
pours
opaque
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
rocky
offwhite
head
metallic
wheat
aroma
with
only
a
small
amount
of
clove
and
bubblegum
sour
wheat
taste
at
first
but
after
23
pulls
it
gets
a
nice
cereal
taste
with
a
good
amount
of
banana
ive
had
better
but
this
is
not
that
bad
d
a
nice
brew
malty
and
pleasant
very
true
to
style
if
i
crave
a
dunkel
i
will
likely
have
this
again
d
very
drinkable
nice
balanced
wheat
would
defiantly
buy
this
one
again
there
might
be
some
better
dunkles
out
there
but
this
is
one
not
to
pass
up
i
actually
poured
the
rest
of
the
bottle
out
not
because
it
was
bad
but
because
i
have
other
better
things
to
drink
than
this
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
pours
out
a
deep
caramel
color
settling
in
the
glass
as
murky
brown
in
the
aroma
there
are
notes
of
apple
cider
and
spice
caramel
and
raisins
appear
as
it
warms
unfortunately
they
dont
really
meld
together
as
for
the
taste
its
a
smooth
taste
one
which
tends
to
be
more
apple
dominant
bitterness
is
very
low
with
the
spice
providing
the
balance
to
the
apple
light
feel
of
alcohol
is
felt
when
the
beer
lands
in
the
stomach
overall
it
does
the
job
anyway
good
beer
would
match
with
foods
well
but
soooo
many
better
beers
out
there
why
drink
this
zum
wohl
drinkability
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
aftertaste
kinda
weirds
me
out
i
would
be
happy
to
have
it
on
tap
but
its
too
average
to
get
another
bottle
of
when
there
are
so
many
other
brews
to
try
drinkability
like
i
said
earlier
a
tad
astringent
but
not
bad
overall
d
this
beer
is
very
smooth
with
some
good
dark
flavors
with
no
notes
of
hops
but
the
big
fizz
cleans
up
the
finish
d
quite
drinkable
but
the
fruitiness
could
wear
on
me
after
more
than
one
hazy
deep
brownblack
with
a
1
offwhite
foamy
head
that
fades
gradually
looks
tasty
nose
is
sweet
bananas
cloves
and
wheat
a
bit
of
spiciness
comes
through
on
warming
but
mostly
its
sweet
bananas
taste
is
more
bananas
some
grains
and
spicy
sweetness
fits
the
style
a
bit
above
average
but
not
exceptional
mouthfeel
is
good
its
tangy
and
foamy
maybe
a
bit
thin
drinkability
is
great
this
is
a
good
agreeable
summer
beer
hopf
dunkle
weisse
is
a
good
effort
and
is
one
of
the
better
more
drinkable
versions
of
the
style
that
ive
had
in
quite
a
while
its
hefe
weizen
brother
is
no
slouch
either
both
are
easy
recommendations
drinkability

i
had
no
problem
emptying
my
weihenstephaner
glass
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
even
if
it
does
look
beautiful
in
its
glass
a
good
choice
for
an
easy
to
drink
beer
but
if
youve
got
the
chance
to
grab
another
dunkel
like
franziskaner
or
erdinger
its
probably
worth
the
extra
few
cents
drinkability
dud
of
a
style
by
and
large
and
this
is
no
exception
it
looks
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
more
than
adequate
less
than
spectacular
eh
just
okay
a
different
taste
from
a
different
region
in
germany
a
good
session
dunkelwiezen
the
beer
pours
from
the
500ml
brown
bottle
a
cloudless
burnished
copper
color
with
a
humongous
creamy
head
the
is
light
tan
in
color
as
it
ever
so
slowly
fades
away
the
residual
lace
forms
a
fine
blanket
to
coat
the
glass
nose
has
a
sweet
caramel
aroma
with
a
nice
bit
of
wheat
fresh
and
pleasant
to
the
senses
start
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
good
grain
presence
and
the
top
is
light
to
middling
in
feel
finish
is
benignly
hopped
and
the
acidity
purposeful
very
dry
aftertaste
a
pleasant
enough
beer
and
one
that
goes
well
with
the
rapidly
approaching
arizona
summer
drinkability
good
but
not
great
for
such
a
dark
colored
beer
the
flavor
is
very
light
another
solid
beer
from
hopf
flavors
are
quite
similar
to
the
helle
just
with
an
added
touch
of
toastiness
easy
drinking
on
all
corners
a
solid
session
beer
this
is
a
nice
find
and
one
i
will
be
going
back
to
purchased
at
sams
in
downers
grove
for
1
79
what
a
bargain
drinkability
is
average
nothing
bad
to
note
here
but
absolutely
nothing
that
stands
out
overall
very
drinkable
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
above
average
overall
cost
2
59
for
the
bottle
as
indeed
did
all
three
of
the
hopfs
i
picked
up
recently
a
tasty
brew
better
than
most
brown
with
orange
hues
good
creamy
head
with
ample
retention
aromas
of
cooked
caramel
sweet
malt
and
banana
as
well
as
some
barnyarngamey
notes
somewhat
fat
in
the
mouth
while
soft
in
texture
with
mild
carbonation
flavors
are
a
bit
gamey
and
very
nutty
with
some
husky
and
caramal
malt
flavors
the
beer
finishes
mildly
watery
very
drinkable
just
it
isnt
the
top
beer
of
its
kind
it
pours
a
cloudy
tawny
brown
body
with
a
full
head
of
creamy
offwhite
foam
that
holds
exceptionally
well
but
leaves
only
minor
lacing
considering
the
style
light
brown
sugar
and
soft
red
berries
dominate
the
aroma
with
only
subtle
hints
of
banana
and
a
gentle
clovelike
spice
appear
in
the
nose
the
body
is
medium
and
it
appears
initially
crisp
and
then
creamy
across
the
palate
due
to
its
very
fine
and
effervescent
natural
carbonation
the
flavor
delivers
a
beautiful
combination
of
soft
maltiness
and
gentle
fruitiness
berries
apples
bananas
its
very
wellbalanced
by
a
soft
bitterness
and
it
finishes
dry
with
a
short
note
of
fruity
yeast
quite
nice
its
weizen
yeast
character
is
somewhat
restrained
offering
a
bit
more
drinkability
certainly
onpar
with
the
better
known
brands
and
well
worth
trying
when
poured
it
was
amber
in
color
with
some
foam
and
a
little
lace
the
smel
was
fruity
with
a
hint
of
some
spice
the
taste
was
dyr
in
the
palate
fruity
and
had
some
spice
not
overly
found
of
this
dunkle
weisse
sort
of
a
flat
taste
on
the
finish
overall
i
was
impressed
with
the
attractiveness
and
smell
of
this
beer
however
i
thought
it
to
be
coming
up
short
on
taste
and
feel
pouring
a
funky
sewage
brown
it
has
an
off
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
usual
banana
and
clove
smells
are
in
there
but
in
lesser
amounts
than
others
of
the
style
the
same
holds
true
for
the
taste
its
not
unpleasant
but
its
a
bit
on
the
light
side
in
the
taste
and
also
in
the
mouthfeel

these
drawbacks

it
has
always
been
hard
to
find
my
specialty
beer
store
had
a
time
getting
it
and
they
dont
have
it
anymore
for
the
last
year
or
so
world
market
was
the
only
place
i
could
get
it
and
now
they
tell
me
its
been
discontinued
in
that
size
this
site
says
its
still
available
how
do
i
get
it
years
ago
as
i
was
going
thru
craft
beer
education
wheat
beers
were
my
favorite
and
this
beer
topped
my
list
i
have
grown
to
be
an
open
minded
hop
head
and
havent
had
this
beer
in
a
few
years
and
not
much
wheat
beer
in
general
im
not
the
best
person
to
review
wheat
beers
this
is
a
very
good
beer
but
i
am
sure
there
are
others
better
made
worth
a
try
works
very
well
with
a
couple
orange
slices
my
favorite
beer
it
is
dark
but
smooth
overall
a
nice
german
wheat
beer
that
is
easydrinking
and
unassuming
all
of
the
required
pieces
are
there
sweet
malt
and
sour
yeast
flavors
its
just
that
when
compared
to
some
of
its
german
competitors
such
as
wienhenstephener
this
ale
comes
off
as
a
touch
bland
a
very
good

not
great

one
of
my
favorites
poured

the

aromas
of

smoked

this
beer
was

i
generally
like
wheat
beers
but
found
this
one
lacking
flavor
and
just
generally
bland
my
favourite
dunkel
it
was
also
the
first
one
i
tried
this
is
my
favorite
commercial
beer
im
always
surprised
that
more
people
dont
love
it
i
even
love
that

i
probably
dont

refreshing
overall
very
good
o
a
solid
dunkelweizen
maybe
not
the
best
but
its
up
there
poured
from
bottle
into
my
tulip
glass
mahogany
tones
with
a
full
finger
of
white
head
didnt
last
long
the
aroma
had
some
banana
spice
nutmeg
and
a
bit
if
a
breadyyeasty
note
the
tastes
were
in
line
with
the
aroma
and
i
mentioned
at
least
once
or
twice
that
it
had
some
of
the
same
taste
profiles
as
a
banananut
bread
and
again
a
hint
of
spice
good
carbonation
and
a
smooth
overall
mouthfeel
to
this
brew
overall
i
thought
that
this
was
a
nice
beer
nice
change
of
pace
from
my
goto
ipas
and
stouts
and
wellcrafted
quite
a
good
deal
for
the
big
bottle
at
around
3
bucks
glad
to
be
expanding
my
beer
horizons
a
bit
and
this
was
a
nice
stop
along
the
road
try
it
o
a
really
well
balanced
weissebier
i
prefer
my
dunkels
to
be
a
bit
lighter
brown
all
in
all
this
was
just
a
good
wellrounded
beer
i
was
hoping
it
would
be
a
great
hot
summer
lawn
mowing
beer
ill
probably
drink
it
as
an
early
autumn
refresher
though
picked
this

with

the

follows

with

of
malty

up

along
with
hints
of

the
mouthfeel
is
medium

and
slightly

with
medium

and
good

overall
a
solid
interpretation
with
good

this
is
a
nice
option
for
a
refreshing

when
youre
also
in

mood
for
something
a

the

it
has

and
different

it

overall
good
but
featuring
a

offtastes
and
an
intense
mouthfeel
id
need
to
try
it
in
germany
to
compare
nice
flavor
with
hint
of
banana
no
hint
at
all
of
a
metallic
aftertaste
noticeably
heavier
than
a
hefe
but
clearly
related
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
like
ice
tea
that
has
a
good
finger
white
foamy
head
lots
of
lacing
was
seen
right
to
the
end
with
each
sip
the
aroma
is
of
dark
bread
with
a
hint
of
cloves
and
banana
very
pleasant
the
taste
was
even
better
with
a
hint
of
dark
fruit
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
with
perfect
carbonation
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
this
is
a
really
great
brew
for
the
colder
months
and
never
have
been
disappointed
overall
i
was
amazed
it
really
fit
the
context
i
was
in
at
the
time
of
drinking
it
i
really
would
drink
this
again
and
again
and
again
perhaps
this
beer
tasted
so
good
because
i
had
just
finished
crosscountry
skiing
in
15
celsius
weather
in
northeast
china
with
a
group
of
german
and
swedish
diehard
ski
bums
we
went
to
one
of
the
few
german
pubrestaurants
in
n
e
china
right
when
we
finished
skiing
this
brew
really
complemented
my
borsch
warm
pretzel
bread
sour
cucumber
cabbage
salad
potatoes
and
marinated
beef
quite
a
hearty
meal
on
a
frigid
day
give
this
beer
a
try
if
you
havent
yet
overall
3
5
good
beer
but
nothing
special
this
beer
is
strange
watery
and
weak
in
places
and
assertive
and
complex
in
others
i
imagine
it
would
be
good
with
food
maybe
a
nice
plate
of
haxen
not
the
best
for
sessioning
as
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
off
in
my
opinion
not
a
horrible
beer
by
any
means
but
certainly
not
the
best
you
will
ever
imbibe
had
this
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
color
is
brownreddish
you
get
a
lot
of
clove
and
banana
in
the
smell
taste
is
a
lot
like
the
smell
but
has
a
caramel
kick
to
it
this
is
my
first
dunkelweizen
and
im
pretty
impressed
i
am
a
big
fan
of
hefes
so
i
wanted
to
try
a
hefe
that
was
a
little
darker
really
like
this
beer
the
caramel
kick
it
has
is
a
fantastic
twist
to
the
beer
i
recommend
it
overall
pretty
solid
beer
delicious
and
tasty
overall
very
solid
dunkel
hefe
cheers
one
of
the
four
or
five
best
examples
of
this
style
that
i
have
ever
had
excellent
on
tap
especially
if
you
get
to
bavaria
lively
and
flavoursome
very
pleasant
and
one
of
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
had
so
far
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
however
i
found
myself
looking
forward
to
the
end
of
the
glass
as
time
went
on
more
enjoyable
to
smell
than
sip
i
dont
always
drink
beer
but
when
i
do
i
drink
hefeweizen
dunkel
where
i
can
get
it
p
serving
type
bottle
into
weizen
glass
o
second
dunkel
ive
had
erdingers
still
better
i
was
actually
slightly
disappointed
given
how
much
i
like
the
franziskaner
weissbier
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
hazy
and
amber
with
a
giant
head
but
no
real
lacing
nose
is
wheaty
with
some
sweet
and
bittersweet
accentuates
woody
wheat
with
a
little
molasses
and
raisin
feels
a
little
shallow
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
so
please
disregard
those
scores
i
usually
order
a
hefeweizen
with
a
meal
in
germany
and
this
dark
hefe
was
a
treat
i
really
enjoyed
the
complex
taste
and
aroma
of
this
beer
it
has
a
nice
balance
of
malts
that
leave
a
nice
smooth
almost
chocolate
aftertaste
i
prefer
dark
hefe
if
they
are
not
too
bitter
and
this
one
is
really
nice
it
is
a
touch
sweet
though
o
a
very
enjoyable
beer
only
the
second
dunkel
i
believe
ive
had
i
feel
this
is
a
good
bar
to
set
as
a
guideline
for
the
style
but
with
more
of
a
banana
feel
to
it
and
it
leaves
a
nice
smooth
wheat
aftertaste
overall
as
this
is
the
beer
that
started
it
all
for
me
i
am
partial
to
it
but
think
the
taste
could
have
a
bit
more
oomph
to
make
it
really
great
a
pretty
good
wheat
ale
in
the
german
style
good
nose
okay
flavor
their
hefe
is
one
of
the
best
but
this
is
just
pretty
good
still
worth
trying
though
and
enjoyable
enough
that
i
would
have
it
again
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
dunkelweizen
solid
flavor
with
a
good
price
and
drinkability
overall
not
a
very
good
wheat
beer
neither
a
very
good
dunkel
particularly
for
what
would
be
approx
au75
a
case
of
24
x
330ml
get
something
else
3
55
overall
it
is
an
ok
beer
nothing
spectacular
one
is
probably
enough
head
was
creamy
and
light
with
aroma
being
a
light
malt
mouthfeel
was
creamy
almost
like
a
hint
of
guinness
though
not
as
robust
as
that
malty
slight
floral
aftertaste
not
impressed
or
interested
by
this
overall
this
is
like
i
said
one
of
my
favorite
beers
for
so
many
years
before
i
tried
so
many
others
from
belgium
and
before
total
wine
and
bevmo
came
to
town
old
world
was
the
greatest
place
in
the
world
and
the
best
place
to
drink
them
this
isthe
last
one
of
the
case
i
bought
a
few
months
ago
and
im
srprised
to
find
i
hadnt
reviewed
it
yet
i
rated
it
but
didnt
review
it
i
still
love
this
stuff
o
a
solid
example
of
a
dunkle
very
representative
of
german
beer
in
general
it
seems
like
a
great
oktoberfest
beer
to
be
drunk
in
the
outskirts
of
a
18th
century
german
brew
town
overlooking
a
field
of
two
row
barley
in
some
september
afternoon
with
friends
overall
a
good
beer
but
a
little
lighter
in
the
malt
department
than
i
expected
i
had
more
of
a
dunkel
lager
with
heavier
flavors
in
mind
but
this
was
also
an
enjoyable
cheap
beer
o
enjoyable
and
super
easy
to
drink
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
the
years
when
i
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
bavaria
at
least
once
a
year
sitting
outside
in
a
beer
garden
and
enjoying
these
on
a
saturday
afternoon
definitely
sessionable
and
a
beer
that
you
could
easily
drink
all
day
not
the
best
ive
had
mainly
because
its
nowhere
near
aggressive
enough
in
its
attack
but
pleasant
and
enjoyable
maybe
a
good
gateway
for
newcomers
to
the
style
due
to
its
restraint
you
can
see
if
you
at
least
like
the
idea
before
you
start
getting
ambitious
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
hazy
caramel
brown
with
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
slowly
i
pick
up
those
aromas
of
banana
and
clove
but
theyre
light
i
detect
some
of
those
darker
malts
in
the
aroma
this
is
a
more
malt
forward
dunkelweizen
which
permits
the
barley
and
wheat
malt
character
to
shine
the
banana
and
clove
flavors
are
mild
but
they
do
come
together
to
give
this
a
light
banana
bread
type
of
character
the
body
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
with
moderate
carbonation
the
finish
is
smooth
the
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
good
beer
o
this
is
a
hefe
with
moderate
dark
malt
characteristics
and
a
little
less
clove
and
banana
then
a
straight
hefe
spice
and
fruit
still
dominate
most
aspect
of
the
beer
a
good
traditional
representation
of
a
style
that
i
dont
get
very
often
i
wish
that
i
could
compare
this
backtoback
to
other
beers
of
the
same
style
ive
had
the
hefeweizen
from
franziskaner
before
and
was
hoping
this
would
at
least
match
it
but
im
severely
disappointed
o
an
exceptionally
goodlooking
beer
with
fine
flavor
but
a
mediocre
mouthfeel
o
i
would
recommend
this
beer
for
an
easy
drink
would
have
expected
more
taste
from
a
franziskaner
hefeweisse
dunkel
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
size
lasting
head
almost
looks
like
a
root
beer
their
is
a
strong
malt
and
yeast
aroma
the
taste
has
a
solid
malt
backbone
and
a
nice
bitterness
and
dryness
good
full
flavor
overall
a
decent
dunkel
enjoyable
but
not
the
best
o
lots
of
flavor
and
seems
to
be
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
just
didnt
enjoy
it
very
much
probably
wont
be
purchasing
this
one
again

really
good

over

if

this
is
your
beer

the

is
good
it

either
this
is
a
very
decent
easy
drinking

beer
it
has
good
flavor
good
body
and
great
drinkability
i
recommend
checking
this
out
a
solid
dunkel
the
nut
flavors
really
pull
everything
together
a
moderate
pour
yields
a
caramel
colored
body
that
is
not
as
translucent
as
anticipated
a
fingerwide
head
comprised
of
eggshell
white
bubbles
adorns
the
surface
retention
and
lacing
seem
a
bit
lacking
the
aroma
is
of
wheat
straw
grass
and
some
grains
that
while
dont
seem
roasted
do
seem
to
have
been
warmed
in
some
way
some
faint
lemon
and
malt
dropped
in
as
well
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
an
emphasis
on
the
wheat
grass
and
straw
notes
some
caramel
mixes
well
with
the
muddled
grains
while
some
lemon
pulls
through
towards
the
rear
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
finishes
clean
the
consistency
is
thinner
than
the
color
of
the
body
may
suggest
but
it
lacks
not
in
flavor
overall
a
great
beer
not
particularly
rare
or
sought
after
these
days
but
one
that
is
certainly
worthy
of
revisiting
any
time
i
love
this
dunkel
weisse
its
what
others
should
be
just
plain
great

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
but
nothing
really
stands
out
to
me
o
ive
had
a
good
number
of
german
and
american
wheats
but
not
too
many
of
the
associated
dark
versions
this
was
a
good
beer
but
to
me
they
are
a
step
down
from
their
brothers
overall
nice
drinkable
brew
i
would
be
willing
to
drink
this
again
from
time
to
time
pours
a
midbrown
caramel
color
with
a
twofinger
very
offwhite
head
aroma
of
spice
caramel
malt
and
a
bit
of
wheat
flavor
follows
fairly
mild
hints
of
wheat
grass
spice
to
start
subtle
sweet
caramel
bready
malt
with
a
bit
of
banana
on
the
back
end
not
nearly
as
big
or
sweet
of
a
malt
compared
to
others
in
the
style
a
bit
subdued
overall
no
big
heffe
flavors
either
o
a
very
good
dunkelweizen
but
a
bit
of
a
heavier
and
chewier
mouthfeel
would
definitely
improve
this
very
easy
drinkable
with
fine
refreshing
character
its
mild
smooth
and
balance
dunkelweizen
overall
a
good
look
and
smell
and
a
pretty
nice
flavor
profile
but
the
mouthfeel
definitely
leaves
something
to
be
desired
not
bad
but
not
great
either
bought
in
celle
germany
this
beer
smells
sweet
and
fruity
bananas
unlike
many
popular
dunkels
it
is
completely
unfiltered
the
head
gives
way
after
a
minute
or
two
not
too
much
lacing
taste
is
rather
sweet
much
like
a
their
hefeweizen
just
with
some
added
chocolate
malts
definitely
a
solid
beer
i
would
buy
again
however
i
believe
there
are
some
better
dunkels
out
there
raisin
brownishred
in
color
with
a
murky
haze
poured
with
a
thick
beige
foam
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
thick
cap
wheat
malt
aroma
is
prominent
with
spicy
clove
and
hints
of
banana
medium
bodied
with
ample
rich
carbonation
and
a
semidry
finish
wheat
and
toasted
malt
flavor
with
clove
up

the
spiciness
intensifies
into
the
middle
giving
way
to
banana
and
yeast
flavors
and
wheat
malt
flavors
to
the
finish
finishes
clean
and
semidry
o
a
very
well
rounded
dunkelweizen
very
refreshing
a
very
drinkable
and
well
priced
beer
im
more
of
a
fan
of
their
regular
hefeweisse
but
this
is
good
when
your
drinking
a
few
franzis
in
a
row
b
overall
its
not
quite
as
good
as
their
regular
hefeweissen
but
its
still
stands
out
a
solid
drink
i
paid
two
fifty
for
a
pintsized
bottle
so
i
can
easily
say
that
what
i
paid
was
worth
the
taste
the
aroma
really
had
me
looking
forward
to
this
but
unfortunately
the
taste
was
just
average
and
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
disappointing
drinkability
and
overall
impression
this
was
an
easy
drinker
with
each
sip
following
easily
from
another
and
tasting
as
good
as
the
last
a
good
solid
well
made
dunkel
weisse
that
hits
the
mark
easily
recommended
from
a
25
fl
oz
bottle
stamped
l1521362054
sampled
on
february
8
2012
the
pour
is
olive
brown
coming
out
of
the
bottle
but
it
becomes
a
dark
amber
tone
with
a
generous
head
in
the
tall
glass
the
aromas
are
modest
with
dark
malts
wheat
yeast
banana
and
clove
the
body
is
on
the
light
to
medium
side
the
flavor
is
scrumptious
with
its
sweet
dark
malts
and
wheat
up
front
and
a
slightly
dry
finale
it
is
a
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
quickly
while
at
the
same
time
savoring
it
a
good
one
ill
have
another
this
is
a
beer
i
could
drink
for
a
long
time
i
will
buy
this
beer
for
special
occasions
in
the
future
overall
very
good
example
of
a
dunkel
weissbier
i
could
session
this
beer
with
no
trouble
refreshing
and
satisfying
o
this
was
an
alright
beer
but
not
anything
id
look
for
in
the
future
the
mouthfeel
is
very
soft
with
a
light
sensation
of
tingliness
the
head
is
creamy
and
dense
due
to
the
tiny
nature
of
the
bubbles
its
like
a
pillow
in
your
mouth
in
the
taste
is
where
you
get
the
banana
and
citrus
notes
as
well
as
carbonation
in
your
face
crisp
and
not
thick
is
what
makes
this
brew
quite
refrshing
for
the
andalousian
summers
pours
a
cloudy
translucent
chestnut
color
with
temporary
lacing
and
good
retention
a
nice
nose
of
roasted
malt
yeast
banana
chocolate
and
clove
is
similar
to
that
of
most
belgian
ales
the
initial
flavor
isnt
bold
but
hints
of
wheat
with
some
sweetness
and
spice
are
present
the
flavor
quickly
subsists
to
a
very
thin
watery
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
overall
the
ale
is
great
right
up
to
the
finish
its
a
nice
session
ale
if
no
other
good
options
are
available
poured
into
weizen
glass
darker
side
of
mahogony
body
and
three
finger
head
nice
wheaty
smell
cherry
a
little
spice
not
too
strong
average
crisp
bite
on
palate
up
front
spicy
wheat
and
sweet
cherry
finish
quite
good
i
like
their
hefeweizen
also
overall
this
is
definitely
a
beer
you
would
use
to
introduce
to
someone
who
is
somewhat
closeminded
when
it
comes
to
beer
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
but
super
smooth
to
other
this
might
be
your
dietcoke
for
beer
connoisseurs
but
then
again
we
all
need
a
light
drink
every
now
and
then
if
this
beer
had
a
season
it
would
be
late
summer
to
fall
why
because
something
this
filling
works
best
in
warm
drier
climates
hope
you
all
enjoy
and
cheers
o
absolutely
delicious
beer
that
was
very
enjoyable
and
one
that
i
would
definitely
have
again
great
drinkability
and
flavors
with
a
beautiful
nose
all
contribute
to
this
experience
o
good
but
ive
had
equallygood
dunkel
weissbeir
for
less
money
and
better
ones
for
not
much
more
its
a
solid
contender
in
its
class
but
not
a
standout
taste
is
very
light
almost
watery
the
yeast
feels
chewy
and
crusty
like
the
curst
of
yeast
bread
the
hefeweizen
yeast
is
taken
over
by
the
bready
crusty
malt
mississippi
river
brown
and
cloudy
with
an
off
white
head
head
formation
consists
of
tiny
uniform
bubbles
and
good

effervescent
bubbler
in
the
center
of

a
la

triple
very
nice
nose
of
yeasty
banana
fruity
esters
taste
banana
right
away
sort
of
clove
and
hair
tonic
dry
at
the
end
thin
watery
feel
but
the
good
amount
of
carbonation
offsets
the
thinness
flavors
and
feel
are
definitely
subdued
in
this
one
the
banana
smell
and
flavor
makes
this
a
unique
offering
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
always
enjoy
thanks
to
dan
and
mary
ann
for
the
holiday
gift
bottle
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
extremely
drinkable
session
ale
its
readily
available
and
can
definitely
be
your
saving
grace
at
a
bar
with
less
than
desirable
tap
selections
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
hazy
amber
red
a
very
fluffy
creamy
white
head
little
or
no
lacing
the
beer
smells
amazing
banana
bread
nuts
raisins
tastes
a
bit
malty
with
a
bready
overtone
hints
of
bananas
nuts
and
caramel
the
mouthfeel
is
very
solid
not
watery
at
all
nor
chewy
overall
this
beer
is
delicious
it
reminds
me
of
orval
with
its
complexity
i
bought
a
single
16
9
oz
bottle
of
this
and
wont
mind
doing
so
again
muddy
brown
in
color
foamy
white
head
earthy
herbal
aroma
bready
taste
with
just
a
bit
of
that
weizen
yeast
flavor
medium
bodied
full
mouthfeel
but
easy
to
drink
my
review
is
based
on
the
draft
version
although
first
introduced
to
this
beer
in
the
bottle
i
highly
prefer
draft
beer
and
have
owned
a
keg
cooler
for
over
25
years
anyone
who
owns
a
keg
cooler
system
understands
that
selection
is
very
limited
compared
to
what
is
available
in
the
bottle
the
two
dunkel
wheat
beers
available
where
i
live
in
the
us
are
franziskaner
and
hackerpschorr
both
are
very
good
but
the
franziskaner
is
more
readily
available
year
round
and
is
therefore
my
favorite
the
great
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
there
has
never
been
a
guest
in
my
home
who
has
not
been
pleased
when
served
with
a
glass
of
this
brew
including
people
who
generally
do
not
like
beer
and
only
drink
light
beers
it
is
truly
exsceptional
to
find
a
beer
that
virtually
everone
from
craft
ipa
drinkers
to
light
beer
drinkers
enjoy
i
can
only
hope
that
this
dunkel
and
more
of
this
style
become
available
in
the
keg
a
fantastic
beer
to
imbibe
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
and
a
nice
german
beer
but
not
very
interesting
or
thoughtprovoking
overall
i
feel
the
flavor
profile
tips
a
bit
too
far
into
banana
and
the
beer
is
not
quite
fresh
enough
i
e
too
malty
and
syrupy
with
not
enough
fresh
elements
to
balance
this
one
is
worth
trying
but
i
feel
that
it
falls
short
of
the
top
tier
as
far
as
this
style
goes
everything
youd
want
is
there
and
is
all
nice
enough
but
it
certainly
isnt
anything
profound
or
even
particularly
memorable
doesnt
really
stand
out
amongst
the
other
dunkels
ive
had
enjoyable
and
definitely
worth
trying
but
could
be
bigger
in
both
taste
and
aroma
overall
nice
drinkable
nice
flavors
all
blended
well
between
the
wheats
fruits
bananas
foster
slight
sweetness
soft
malts
and
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
there
are
plenty
of
dunkels
that
are
better
but
this
is
a
nice
drinking
one
esp
one
that
i
can
buy
regularly
draught
poured
at
canterbury
ales
huntington
ny
deep
copper
brown
good
head
with
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
aroma
i
love
the
taste
of
franziskaner
hefeweisse
dunkel
good
maltiness
and
the
kind
of
subtle
complexity
that
causes
people
to
write
they
taste
cocoa
bananas
etc
i
understand
the
analogies
but
im
content
to
say
this
is
the
finest
drink
ive
had
this
season
malty
not
bitter
a
great
bavarian
beer
i
certainly
enjoy
this
is
dark
beer
with
a
light
mouthfeel
drinking
a
pint
doesnt
feel
like
you
just
ate
an
entire
meal
now
im
curious
about
dunkelweizen
style
and
will
have
to
try
more
examples
overall
this
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
lacks
any
nice
umph
or
rememorable
flavors
to
make
me
want
to
revisit
not
a
favorite
style
of
mine
to
be
honest
but
i
have
had
much
better
and
more
full
flavored
examples
a
one
and
done
for
me
the
beer
tasted
of
caramel
sweetness
with
a
dominant
banana
toffee
backbone
nice
sweet
but
not
in
your
face
the
taste
panned
to
a
tartness
that
was
pleasant
and
gave
the
sweetness
a
good
foil
very
refreshing
and
balanced
on
the
palate
mouthfeel
was
creamy
but
at
the
same
time
light
enough
to
be
enjoyed
in
copious
amounts
i
would
really
rate
the
kaner
hefedunkel
very
high
on
the
drinkability
front
a
nice
flavourful
sessionable
beer
that
wont
as
the
say
break
your
bank
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
the
franziskanerhefe
it
is
a
good
late
night
version
of
the
its
daytime
hefeweizen
counterpart
lastly
it
goes
down
petty
smooth
it
has
a
nice
low
level
of
carbonation
starts
out
wet
has
a
nice
medium
body
and
then
it
finishes
with
a
light
waster
crispness
crisp
with
a
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
very
likable
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown
with
an
inch
thick
foamy
ecru
head
smells
of
biscuit
breads
clove
and
slight
hint
of
banana
tastes
similarly
with
a
weary
sweet
clove
the
banana
isnt
noticeable
in
the
taste
as
it
was
in
the
nose
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
not
quite
what
i
would
call
thick
the
unfiltered
proteins
make
for
that
recognizable
and
enjoyable
texture
a
very
drinkable
and
versatile
beer
for
food
pairing
always
enjoyable
having
this
familiars
beer
in
front
of
me
absolutely
awesome
loving
dunkels
nice
beer
here
boy
what
a
nice
drinker
those
germans
they
sure
know
how
to
make
a
nice
wheat
ale
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
weizen
glass
this
beer
is
just
about
as
enjoyable
as
the
regular
franziskaner
hefe
this
one
poured
out
as
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
light
tan
colored
head
on
top
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
little
spicier
than
the
regular
version
and
still
holds
onto
the
banana
aromas
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
earthy
and
a
little
spicy
the
clove
and
banana
still
shine
through
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
is
on
the
thicker
side
as
well
overall
this
beer
is
really
pretty
good
and
totally
worth
trying
o
a
fantastic
dunkelweizen
this
is
a
beer
id
definitely
drink
again
o
a
surprisingly
tasty
treat
improves
as
it
warms
and
gets
a
bit
spicier
as
a
hefeweizen
fanatic
i
prefer
this
dunkel
to
their
straight
light
hefe
which
is
itself
a
beauty
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
am
glad
to
know
its
well
stocked
here
in
chicago
overall
couldnt
ask
for
a
better
dunkel
o
average
maybe
it
isnt
my
style
of
beer
however
the
rotted
banana
flavor
probably
isnt
going
to
make
anyone
happy
overallif
you
like
dunkels
i
would
buy
this
if
you
dont
then
i
wouldnt
plain
jane
o
straightforward
but
really
good
tasting
its
sweet
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
taste
d
outstanding
delicious
and
quaffable
this
is
a
dunkelweizen
done
right
definite
reco
here
a
very
malty
and
dry
in
the
palate
the
nose
is
quite
fruity
weissbier
could
be
mistaken
for
a
light
bodied
stout
in
a
blind
tasting
lacks
a
bit
of
freshness
and
fruityness
in
the
palate
of
a
typical
weizen
pours
a
dark
ruby
brown
with
about
1cm
of
lumpy
and
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
forever
smells
spicy
yeasty
and
of
noble
hops
the
taste
is
of
caramel
yeast
and
and
very
sweet
just
enough
bitterness
to
offset
the
sweetness
not
much
in
the
way
of
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
heavy
slightly
fizzy
overall
its
very
drinkable
especially
if
you
like
hefes
and
i
do
overall
the
smell
was
the
best
part
a
good
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
the
flavor
to
pop
a
little
bit
more
o
d
this
is
pretty
good
not
spectacular
solid
tasty
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
smooth
and
pretty
drinkable
a
really
great
beer
for
a
low
price
dvery
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
would
love
to
have
this
with
food
i
will
drink
this
again
even
though
the
franz
brand
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
macro
giants
this
brew
along
with
its
varieties
still
maintain
their
resounding
reliability
ill
continue
to
buy
them
as
long
as
it
stays
that
way
cheers
o
a
good
dunkel
smooth
and
tasty
but
could
use
some
more
depth
in
the
taste
to
make
it
top
tier
oit
seemed
to
get
more
watery
as
i
drank
it
i
didnt
appreciate
that
i
had
500ml
of
this
the
first
200
were
great
the
last
300
had
lost
a
lot
of
quality
it
just
doesnt
have
a
lot
of
robustness
to
be
considered
a
great
dunkel
enjoyable
and
drinkable
not
the
best
dunkel
out
there
but
very
accessible
available
and
affordable
poured
a
cloudy
deep
mahogany
brown
into
a
weiss
glass
with
a
small
tan
head
the
smell
was
of
sweet
malts
bubble
gum
and
clove
the
taste
was
excellent
on
this
one
banana
bread
clove
bubblegum
dried
orange
peel
and
some
floral
hops
this
is
a
very
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anyone
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
would
not
offend
immature
palates
bro
francis
came
roaring
out
of
his
home
resulting
in
a
big
foamy
finger
of
tan
head
with
moderate
retention
color
was
a
very
cloudy
dark
reddishbrown
nose
was
big
with
a
pleasant
admixture
of
banana
and
clove
with
the
former
leading
the
way
and
the
latter
directly
underneath
mouthfeel
was
big
and
full
with
banana
the
main
attraction
followed
by
pink
bubble
gum
and
then

it
is
a
good
thing
that
i
have
been
exposed
to
a
number
of
hefeweizens
recently
or
i
would
have
hated
this
i
am
more
mature
in
terms
of
my
palate
so
it
is
palatable
but
i
am
still
not
a
big
fan
of
the
banana
esters
being
so
prevalent
finish
reminded
me
of
banana
bread
simply
in
liquid
form
which
is
appropriate
since
it
was
the
monks
who
first
referred
to
beer
as
liquid
bread
i
just
wish
that
the
clovespiciness
had
been
more
forward
o
a
refreshing
beer
went
down
quite
easy
nice
change
of
pace
from
all
the
hops

usually
consume

smells
of

malt

much
less
banana
aroma
than
i
remember
the
hefeweizen
being
pretty
appetizing
looking
and
smelling
full
and
amazingly
smooth
mouthfeel
acidity
is
just
right
bananas
come
across
in
the
flavor
much
more
than
the
smell
nicely
balanced
caramelized
sweetness
the
darker
malts
are
just
delicious
great
beer
an
easy
drinker
i
could
have
zipped
through
a
few
more
of
these
overall
drinkability
a
solid
good
beer
but
one
that
needs
to
warm
up
to
65f
or
more
to
really
be
good
good
with
a
meal
salmon
cakes
new
potatoes
and
by
itself
after
the
meal
d
i
generally
like
dunkelweizens
more
than
the
lighter
versions
this
one
is
not
an
exception
and
a
really
fine
drinker
only
the
best
traits
from
dunkels
and
weizens
and
then
some
all
rolled
into
one
not
so
loud
in
aroma
the
proper
scents
are
there
yet
weak
glassware
surprised
the
head
poofed
out
as
quickly
as
it
did
giving
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
here
though
its
a
solid
beer
extremely
drinkable
like
its
companion
lighter
version
ill
skip
this
one
in
the
future
to
many
outstanding
ones
from
others
oa
fantastic
summer
beer
i
like
keeping
a
few
around
and
hitting
them
up
every
once
in
while
its
not
something
i
would
want
to
drink
every
day
but
a
great
once
a
week
summer
beer
i
suppose
i
like
dark
colors
more
than
light
colors
but
between
that
and
a
few
light
darker
malt
notes
this
beer
comes
off
as
bit
better
than
their
other

still
ive
had

quite
a

a
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
overall
a
good
session
brew
for
a
warmer
spring
day
first
had
this
on
tap
in
a
22
oz
glass
it
was
kind
of
disappointing
im
a
big
fan
of
dunkels
and
in
my
early
drinking
days
i
saw
dunkel
on
this
tap
handle
so
i
ordered
it
up
without
a
second
thought
when
i
saw
the
light
golden

come
out
of
the

the

so
i
was
excited
to
learn
that
they
also
had
a
dunkel
unfortunately
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
it
was
a

stopped
into

and
mentioned
that
this
beer
has
been
long
discontinued
yet
i
just
bought
one
here
was
told
that
the
distributor
is
selling
them
and
had
a

picked
up
a

and
its
clearly
stamped

no
real
concern
from
the
lbs
about
it
rather
an
attitude
of
we
stock
whatever
the
distributor
gives
us
and
we
dont
pay
that
much
attention
more
dunkel
in
the
straight
lager
sense
than
a
weizen
i
feel
good
and
pretty
drinkable
but
eh
d
about
what
i
expect
from
shiner
except
for
their
anniversary
beers
its
nothing
special
and
id
turn
to
something
else
instead
eric

decent

pretty

d
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkel
and
one
of
the
better
brews
from
spoetzl
brewery
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
could
enjoy
anytime
d
a
misleading
dunkelweizen
tastes
very
similar
to
the
style
yet
doesnt
look
and
feel
like
one
easy
to
have
more
then
a
few
of
these
o
the
drinkability
is
pretty
high
i
would
say
based
on
its
overall
lightnessthinness
not
overall
an
excellent
beer
but
not
bad
its
not
like
previous
dunkels
ive
had
before
seems
like
a
good
intro
into
quality
beer
though
maybe
not
the
best
example
of
a
dunkel
out
there
d
a
drinkable
beer
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not

kick
decent
representation

this
isnt

one
that

mightily
impressed

the
beer
its
not
quite
a

but
would
make
a

solid

backbone
with
mild
graininess
hints
of

at

clean

taste

really

to

head
subsided
into
a
thin
skim
of

almost
immediately
and
then
nothing
nose
is
hard
to
place
malt
i
guess
flavors
are
predominantly
malt
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
detect
other
flavors
due
to
the
slightly
metallic
taste
at
finish
kind
of
like
pennies
pleasantly
effervescect
mouthfeel
but
drinkability
is
seriously
compromised
by
the
aftertaste
nice
dark
color
but
not
very
much
head
the
smell
was
nice
had
a
little
roasted
aroma
to
it
taste
was
decent
but
fairly
bland
with
some
more
roastyness
mouthfeel
was
ok
also
a
little
bitter
cant
taste
the
alcohol
fairly
drinkable
but
not
much
to
write
home
about
amber
to
crimson
shades
in
a
weizen
glass
with
a
tall
beige
head
actually
a
nice
looking
beer
smell
is
a
touch
metal
very
light
roast
malt
taste
is
a
bit
watery
yet
somewhat
creamy
very
mildly
flavored
with
a
lightly
bitter
and
tart
malt
flavor
not
really
getting
a
lot
of
wheat
really
not
too
familiar
with
the
style
but
this
probably
isnt
the
best
example
drinkable
but
unremarkable
my
favorite
part
of
this
beer
was
the
aftertaste
which
used
to
be
very
sweet
on
your
lips
this
years
batch
tastes
very
skunky
i
was
very
dissappointed
a
decent
brew
it
reminds
me
some
of
a
dopplebock
than
it
does
a
wheat
beer
a
solid
brew
thats
worth
the
try
even
if
it
is
a
little
scattershot
on
the
style
chart
because
shiner
hefeweizen
along
with
98
bavarian
style
amber
is
my
favorite
spoetzl
brew
i
thought
theyd
do
a
pretty
job
with
their
dunkelweizen
uh
no
id
recommend
going
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
rethinking
this
whole
thing
poured
into
a
mug
this
is
somewhat
light
in
body
for
a
winter
brew
chocolate
in
the
nose
the
palate
is
doughy
but
not
very
complex
well
assembled
this
may
not
be
on
the
level
of
say
aventinus
or
erdinger
but
from
a
dignified
brewery
in
texas
this
is
very
impressive
indeed
in
fact
i
really
have
no
beef
with
spoetzl
brewerys
products
they
are
a
real
brewery
with
a
real
personality
this
dunkel
is
good
their
bohemian
black
lager
is
an
american
schwartz
beer
classic
d
would
benefit
from
more
complex
flavors
but
overall
its
not
too
bad
simple
and
easy
drinking
it
wasnt
bad
but
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
poured

dark

beer
with

nice
fluffy

head
smell
of

malt
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
a

creamy
drinkability
is
ok
seems
to
be
a
weak
version
of
the
stylenot
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
versions
of
the
style
appearance
is
dark
amber
garnet
with
very
little
head
aroma
is
pleasant
somewhat
sweet
and
toasty
taste
is
taosty
oaty
malty
with
a
little
bitterness
the
sweetness
and
maltiness
dominates
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
bitter
and
leaves
a
bit
of
smokiness
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
smooth
the
beer
feels
a
bit
overcarbonated
to
me
it
is
tasty
and
quite
drinkable
but
not
exceptional
if
you
are
a
shiner
devotee
this
might
be
a
nice
way
to
vary
your
consumption
a
bit
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
seeking
it
out
i
will
probably
buy
it
again
but
it
is
not
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
was
a
nice
find
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
pour
so
darkly
between
the
color
of
a
bock
and
a
nut
brown
ale
the
beer
poured
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipated
quickly
into
lacing
the
smell
was
good
of
wheat
yeast
and
sweetness
the
taste
was
pretty
darn
good
almost
tasted
like
a
brown
ale
mixed
with
a
wheat
i
was
very
surpised
at
how
refreshing
this
beer
was
i
will
definitely
purchase
this
beer
again
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pub
glass
poured
a
dark
cola
color
with
a
tan
1finger
head
this
beer
has
a
slight
wheat
smell
to
it
and
has
the
flavor
of
a
pale
hefewiezen
with
a
little
carbonation
there
is
a
slight
wheat
and
malt
smell
to
it
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
overall
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
not
the
best
beer
or
dunkelweizen
but
a
good
version
by
an
american
brewery
pick
this
up
instead
of
shiner
bock
when
it
is
in
season
being
from
texas
i
always
enjoy
a
good
shiner
wasnt
able
to
taste
it
at
the
brewery
but
picked
up
a
6
pack
it
pours
a
nice
reddish
amber
color
and
doesnt
have
much
head
the
taste
and
smell
are
kinda
fruity
and
nutty
the
mouth
feel
is
ok
and
it
can
easily
been
drank
this
isnt
bad
its
highly
sessionable
but
it
just
doesnt
have
any
flavor
or
smell
its
weird
it
pours
so
nice
its
as
if
someone
stole
the
flavor
from
the
bottle
drinkability
great
beer
to
drink
not
too
filling
but
just
right
you
wont
confuse
this
bier
with
a
good
german
dunkel
wiezen
like
weihenstephaner
or
franzisckaner
sp
having
always
been
able
to
either
tolerate
or
enjoy
all
of
the
beers
from
the
shiner
line
i
picked
up
this
dunkelweizen
along
with
their
schwarzbier
awhile
back
pours
a
ruby
brown
cranberry
hue
with
a
thin
off
white
beige
head
leaves
thin
trickled
lacing
all
around
my
wheat
beer
glass
aroma
contains
mild
metallic
notes
with
a
muted
chocolate
and
toasted
nut
with
caramel
drizzled
on
the
load
of
fermentable
sugars
provided
from
the
roasted
malts
balanced
with
mild
herbal
hops
almost
minty
again
this
is
tame
with
not
much
yeast
fruitiness
going
on
here
flavor
my
beloved
clove
and
banana
yeast
traits
are
absent
it
tastes
more
like
a
dunkel
lager
clean
roasty
mild
chocolate
with
caramel
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
toasted
nut
quality
with
a
light
dose
of
herbal
finishing
hops
mouthfeel
is
very
thin
bodied
for
a
dunkelweizen
light
to
medium
bodied
range
with
no
effervescence
typical
of
the
style
standard
moderate
carbonation
here
drinkability
poor
lacks
the
standard
challenging
and
refreshing
characteristics
typically
found
in
a
dunkelweizen
this
was
ok
but
maybe
a
little
boring
nothing
really
stood
out
not
bad
but
if
you
want
a
really
good
shiner
beer
try
the
shiner
97
bohemian
black
lager
schwarzbier
that
stuff
is
fine
not
much
head
and
it
left
quickly
lacing
was
minimal
decent
dunkelweizen
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
what
this
beer
lacks
in
overall
talent
it
makes
up
for
in
gumption
this
is
by
far
spoetzls
most
ambitious
and
possibly
most
talented
brew
and
many
could
do
well
to
follow
its
example
drinkability
not
off
by
any
means
just
way
off
the
mark
for
a
dunkelweizen
i
wonder
what
kind
of
yeast
they
use
for
this
drinkability
this
is
an
ok
beer
not
a
dunkelweizen
in
the
traditional
sense
or
in
the
sense
that
i
recognize
a
dunkelweizen
i
kept
waiting
for
this
beer
to
open
up
and
it
never
did
unfortunately
not
much
for
me
to
come
back
for
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
brew
light
body
not
enough
carbonation
still
this
was
tasty
if
not
seeming
to
be
in
the
style
certainly
worth
trying
and
one
of
the
better
shiner
beers
for
me
d
light
taste
and
body
make
it
drinkable
the
flavor
is
not
as
rich
or
malty
as
the
nose
suggests
but
there
is
a
clearly
wheatlike
character
to
it
and
the
traditional
bavarian
wheatyeast
characteristics
are
missing
bananaclove
but
theyre
generally
restrained
within
the
dunkle
style
anyway
its
nicely
balanced
with
a
sturdy
bitterness
beneath
and
some
spicy
and
grassyfloral
hop
character
gives
it
some
depth
and
offsets
the
dark
cocoa
component
it
finishes
dry
with
a
dusting
of
cocoa
and
a
smattering
of
grassy
hop
flavors
drank
really
easy
probably
not
yeasty
enough
for
most
purists
but
not
a
bad
beer
to
knock
with
some
brisket
or
pizza
or
to
enjoy
watching
a
sunset
or
football
game
ill
take
ths
over
their
so
called
bock
any
day
this
is
a
really
nice
looking
beer
that
has
a
nice
dark
amber
color
to
it
it
poured
out
with
little
head
and
has
no
lace
i
could
smell
a
hint
of
alcohol
in
it
and
there
is
a
faint
smell
of
wheat
mixed
in
the
aroma
it
has
a
smooth
feel
to
it
not
crisp
but
not
dull
either
it
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
mild
alcohol
after
taste
drinkability
is
good
its
missing
some
of
the
characteristic
weizen
character
but
has
a
great
solid
malt
body
enjoyable
a
highly
drinkable
german
style
brew
brewed
right
here
in
central
texas
not
the
best
but
a
very
good
interpretation
of
the
style
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
deep
amber
forming
a
thick
2
inch
head
leaving
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
slight
fruit
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
average
for
the
style
the
taste
is
like
shiner
bock
but
with
the
addition
of
a
light
fruity
backdrop
not
a
bad
brew
but
not
exactly
something
that
i
could
drink
a
sixer
of
in
one
setting
an
okay
offering
from
shiner
apple
phenol
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
a
good
dunkel
that
could
be
world
class
with
some
tweaking
recommended
average
dunkel
weizen
not
as
bad
as
the
hefe
weizen
or
renamed
american
wheat
beer
highlights
of
this
beer
is
the
sweeter
malt
component
not
much
hoppiness
to
balance
it
which
is
a
good
thing
for
those
who
like
that
style
consider
it
an
american
dark
wheat
ale
d
eh
could
do
or
could
not
do
12
oz
with
no
freshness
date
and
a
blurb
about
the
beer
being
krausened
it
pours
a
crystalclear
radiant
amber
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
a
finger
of
tan
head
with
an
aroma
of
overripe
fruit
and
molasses
on
the
palate
it
has
light
carbonation
on
top
of
a
medium
body
and
tastes
of
molasses
ripe
banana
mild
wheat
and
apple
and
spicy
hops
that
leave
a
mild
bitterness
and
finish
first
off
this
should
be
unfiltered
and
second
it
doesnt
taste
enough
like
a
wheat
beer
they
make
a
pretty
decent
hefe
so
i
figured
this
one
would
be
on
the
same
level
but
it
falls
short
overall
its
not
great
for
its
style
but
for
the
price
id
say
its
quite
good
if
it
was
available
around
here
i
could
see
buying
this
in
a
pinch
more
often
than
not
opinion
this
is
pretty
typical
of
spoetzl
brewing
it
is
pretty
thin
and
uneventful
with
some
flavors
that
are
out
of
balance
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
i
have
drank
numerous
dunkelweiss
beers
in
bavaria
and
this
beer
comes
as
close
to
a
dunkelweizen
as
their
bock
is
to
a
true
german
bock
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
would
prefer
something
with
a
bit
of
depth
and
some
real
flavor
i
wont
be
drinking
this
often
i
tell
you
a
nice
american
adaptation
of
a
dunkelweizen
not
nearly
as
much
character
as
some
ive
tried
but
german
wheat
beers
arent
my
favorite
style
so
that
doesnt
particularly
bother
me
quite
tasty
there
were
several
places
where
this
faltered
1
hardly
any
wheat
characteristics
2
filtered
and
it
doesnt
help
that
shiners
yeast
strain
is
boring
to
begin
with
3
hop
bitterness
had
too
much
presence
really
this
just
reminded
me
of
a
subpar
munich
dunkel
lager
actually
one
more
thing
worth
noting
is
that
i
tasted
it
when
it
first
was
sold
in
oklahoma
and
wasnt
impressed
with
it
but
now
it
seems
much
better
even
past
the
expiration
date
either
this
beer
improves
with
age
or
i
got
a
bad
sixpack
before
the
beer
after
its
extraction
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
sets
in
the
glass
a
deep
clear
brown
with
a
portly
semicreamy
light
tan
head
that
after
its
dissipation
leaves
an
obfuscating
sheet
of
lace
upon
the
glass
nose
is
sweet
with
malt
and
a
hint
of
toasted
wheat
also
seems
like
a
little
caramel
fresh
an
pleasing
to
the
senses
at
any
rate
start
is
somewhat
sweet
with
a
fair
to
middling
grain
presence
and
the
top
middling
in
feel
finish
is
benignly
acidic
the
hops
subdued
as
one
would
expect
very
dry
and
clinging
aftertaste
a
drinkable
beer
good
spring
beer
if
its
still
a
bit
chilly
outside
but
warm
enough
for
wheat
beer
i
am
not
entirely
impressed
with
any
shiner
beer
i
have
had
this
one
also
falls
into
that
not
memorable
character
as
much
of
the
other
spoetzl
beers
do
the
best
shiner
ive
had
so
far
nice
head
pretty
dark
and
reasonably
carbonated
has
the
typical
shiner
taste
but
is
not
as
prevalent
as
the
original
bock
live
other
shiners
the
alchohol
is
not
to
strong
it
is
worth
a
try
sometime
you
could
do
far
worse
than
this
beer
the
taste
carries
that
toasted
wheat
with
a
sweet
side
hints
of
toffee
caramel
honey
and
spice
the
mouth
is
left
with
a
cream
like
feel
with
hints
of
malts
left
behind
overall
drinkable
as
well
body
is
medium
creamy
texture
with
big
bubbles
lending
an
expansive
mouthfeel
that
ends
up
flat
looks
like
coke
and
bourbon
with
a
nice
white
head
smells
of
wheat
and
light
fruit
citrus
touch
the
flavor
is
pretty
forgettable
some
sweet
wheat
malt
and
a
slight
undercurrent
of
dark
malt
flavor
but
nothing
really
screaming
out
good
but
nothing
bad
either
thin
in
the
mouth
makes
for
a
bad
impression
but
good
for
drinkability
it
is
what
it
is
and
that
aint
much
this
plenty
drinkable
but
not
crazy
good
either
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
works
well
on
cooler
evenings
in
late
fall
very
nice
deep
chestnut
brown
color
with
a
great
head
that
lasted
a
while
good
aromasomewhat
sweet
and
malty
very
slight
yeast
and
phenolic
notes
good
malty
flavor
none
of
the
usual
characteristics
you
would
find
in
a
german
dunkelweizen
finishes
slightly
dry
good
mouthfeel
overall
a
decent
dunkelweizen
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
weisse
beers
period
though
i
find
us
versions
palatable
i
wasnt
impresed
with
this
at
first
but
its
actually
quite
a
good
beer
d
overall
it
was
ok
nothing
too
fancy
but
an
ok
beer
to
have
every
now
and
then
ofcourse
it
was
a
little
better
than
what
i
thought
it
would
be
received
this
beer
when
i
ordered
the
pot
luck
special
at
mitchs
tavern
nothing
special
somewhat
deviant
from
the
style
but
not
bad
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
12
ounce
brown
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
rich
dark
reddish
brown
with
a
thin
head
that
quickly
dissipates
nice
sweet
toasty
malt
aroma
with
a
little
caramel
and
toffe
in
the
background
taste
very
much
like
it
smells
rich
and
malty
with
just
a
little
hop
bitterness
very
clean
finish
a
good
solid
offering
from
the
folks
at
shiner
overall
impression
i
actually
drank
most
of
this
six
pack
straight
from
the
bottle
and
after
taking
the
time
to
review
this
one
i
think
that
is
the
best
way
to
drink
this
beer
it
is
highly
drinkable
but
no
outstanding
qualities
nice
session
beer
but
nothing
to
specifically
seek
out
formerly
the
shiner
winter
ale
renamed
and
repackaged
with
a
recent
label
facelift
why
the
label
has
austins
congress
street
bats
on
it
i
cant
figure
as
the
town
of
shiner
is
80
or
so
miles
southeast
rather
mundane
beer
from
a
rather
mundane
brewery
really
tastes
more
like
a
warmer
than
a
dunkleweizen
this
is
shiners
winter
ale
rebranded
which
i
never
tried
a
very
disappointing
beer
from
shiner
which
has
generally
improved
their
line
in
recent
years
the
worst
beer
ever
taste
like
parmesan
cheese
awful
12
oz
can
part
of
a
six
pack
from
winco
mega
grocer
in
salem
7
29
i
have
no
idea
how
this
got
here
but
lets
try
it
out
pours
a
very
attractive
darker
amber
with
garnet
hints
and
a
lovely
smooth
creamy
tan
head
can
get
peaches
right
enough
in
the
aroma
they
tend
to
dominate
only
later
do
the
nuts
and
caramel
arrive
taste
is
rather
thinner
than
expected
but
its
nice
enough
again
getting
lot
of
peach
some
spicy
peppery
stuff
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
fine
kinda
thin
mouth
feel
but
its
got
nice
tight
carbonation
that
helps
nice
fruity
beer
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
in
2010
it
was
amazing
when
it
is
bottled
or
canned
it
just
doesnt
taste
anything
like
the
draft
version
if
you
can
get
in
tap
go
for
it
if
not
just
skip
it
seasonal
brew
that
you
better
get
early
san
antonio
favorite
crisp
taste
and
very
refreshing
many
whine
lovers
enjoy
this
beer
not
a
good
combo
one
and
done
can
murky
brown
amber
with
off
white
head
smell
is
sweet
and
on
thick
side
taste
follows
dont
really
get
peaches
or
pecans
just
sweet
bordering
syrupy
have
tried
this
twice
and
couldnt
finish
either
got
the
beer
because
it
was
on
sale
at
my
local
store
not
bad
but
id
never
buy
it
for
its
original
price
really
not
worth
it
a
friend
from
work
gave
me
a
couple
of
these
beers
i
like
several
spoetzl
products
but
was
skeptical
of
this
one
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
smooth
and
tasty
this
beer
was
this
would
be
great
anytime
not
just
the
holidays
strong
malty
aroma
has
a
firm
overtone
of
peach
sweet
and
tempting
but
not
too
sweet
got
a
nutty
hint
no
doubt
from
the
pecans
pours
a
clear
sienna
with
a
fairly
thick
buff
head
peach
dominates
the
flavor
but
does
not
overwhelm
the
malty
nutty
earthy
and
hoppy
notes
hop
bitterness
nicely
balances
the
sweetness
from
the
peaches
texture
has
average
body
and
plenty
of
lively
fizz
anytime
is
the
season
for
good
beer
theres
just
something
about
it
if
youre
a
fan
of
peach
and
pecan
youll
be
very
happy
im
not
so
i
didnt
care
for
this
great
light
peach
flavor
with
mild
pale
ale
bit
it
smells
and
tastes
like
peaches
way
too
sweet
and
syrupy
for
my
tastes
sweet
to
taste
not
bad
as
seen
before
you
dont
want
to
drink
too
many
too
much
peach
way
to
sweet
tasting
very
sugary
o
good
holiday
brew
very
cheery
and
flavorful
great
peach
taste
but
you
cant
drink
too
many
getting
rid
if
the
holiday
brew
not
bad
interesting
peach
taste
o
definitely
interesting
and
different
for
a
winter
brew
and
dunkelweizen
but
a
good
iteration
if
you
want
just
that
the
peach
and
pecan
certainly
mark
the
brew
which
is
a
good
thing
for
the
sake
of
being
different
worth
seeking
out
which
isnt
easily
said
for
any
other
shiner
beer
was
very
sweet
even
for
a
dunkel
first
beer
in
months
ive
had
to
give
away
perfect
color
great
taste
really
enjoyed
it
should
be
rated
higher
nice
winter
option
good
alternative
to
the
typical
dark
winter
warmers
had
this
on
draft
fruity
aroma
smooth
and
very
drinkable
with
a
hint
of
peach
although
this
is
a
seasonal
i
could
drink
it
in
the
summer
beer
advocate
made
me
do
this
i
dont
like
fruity
beer
but
this
stuff
is
different
i
like
this
a
cheerful
beer
at
the
end
of
the
year
medium
amber
fragrant
head
fades
quickly
to
a
small
swirl
smell
of
peach
and
primary
taste
of
pecan
over
a
medium
sweet
malt
base
a
nice
holiday
beer
brownishcopper
with
golden
edges
the
peaches
come
through
in
the
nose
and
flavor
profile
too
the
finish
was
tart
and
dry
and
was
accompanied
by
an
odd
aftertaste
o
different
and
not
bad
but
i
doubt
i
would
buy
a
sixer
or
a
pint
cheers
perfect
after
a
long
day
of
work
or
holiday
prep
o
flavorful
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
if
youre
into
the
peach
flavor
its
a
decent
beer
otherwise
its
just
mediocre
at
best
pours
with
a
mediumsized
white
head
had
a
very
dark
amber
color
has
an
aroma
of
wheat
and
peaches
the
taste
is
a
mixture
of
flavors
initial
one
is
peach
and
wheat
after
taste
is
of
malts
and
roasted
pecans
with
a
slight
bitterness
caused
from
the
malted
barley
a
great
balance
is
created
between
all
the
flavors
although
its
meant
as
a
holiday
drink
i
can
imagine
drinking
it
in
the
summer
also
the
fruitiness
is
not
too
sweet
i
can
discern
the
caramel
or
dark
wheat
but
not
so
much
the
nutty
flavors
in
the
description
strong
aftertaste
on
the
tongue
the
texture
is
like
a
light
beer
with
a
hint
of
bubbles
easy
to
enjoy
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
good
peach
flavor
that
seems
to
be
missing
in
most
peach
beers
the
brownish
color
caught
me
by
surprise
head
did
not
last
and
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smell
is
pure
peach
the
taste
is
peach
on
the
front
and
a
sweet
nutty
taste
on
the
back
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
offering
from
shiner
my
favorite
from
this
brewery
to
date
outlier
detected
please
enter
a
review
canned
peaches
hint
of
pecans
hint
of
malt
very
slight
hop
bite
on
the
back
end
just
to
much
peach
for
me
with
a
deep
crystal
clear
garnet
hue
supporting
a
beige
creamy
head
this
beer
has
a
strong
perfumy
peach
aroma
that
comes
though
more
on
the
exhale
the
flavor
has
a
crisp
light
roasted
bitter
note
and
some
soft
nutty
notes
to
follow
the
dry
peach
note
in
the
finish
is
a
bit
artificial
this
is
a
mellow
soft
flavored
beer
but
the
peach
flavor
is
a
bit
odd
and
dominates
the
flavor
this
oldworld
style
brew
actually
pained
me
physically
to
drink
one
of
the
few
beers
ive
ever
had
to
pour
out
overall
a
pretty
solid
twist
on
a
dunkel
really
nice
peach
flavor
that
is
sweet
but
far
from
cloying
i
dont
taste
much
difference
between
this
and
their
regular
flagship
brew
and
thats
pretty
okay
with
me
theyre
both
solid
beers
and
this
one
fits
in
line
with
many
holiday
beers
in
that
its
safe
its
not
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
its
not
bad
at
all
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
and
full
of
peaches
taste
is
peaches
sweet
a
bit
of
grains
not
what
i
expected
from
this
style
but
not
bad
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
overall
extremely
good
as
far
as
flavoredfruit
beers
go
the
first
pecan
beer
i
can
recall
having
where
i
can
actually
taste
the
pecan
flavor
well
done
shiner
i
had
this
poured
into
a
pint
glass
my
first
review
of
a
shiner
offering
the
color
is
nice
and
inviting
a
warm
copper
brown
the
taste
well
its
super
fruity
like
very
fruity
i
like
dunkelweizens
in
general
but
this
might
have
been
a
bit
too
much
peach
i
could
have
one
of
these
around
the
holidays
each
year
but
probably
not
more
than
that
i
love
it
in
a
black
tan
interesting
taste
with
a
fruity
zing
had
to
read
about
it
here
to
figure
out
the
fruit
was
peach
underlaid
with
pecans
the
comparison
to
fruitcake
is
apt
but
in
a
good
way
doesnt
taste
stale
or
dull
by
any
means
enjoyed
it
very
much
last
night
as
a
complement
to
texas
barbq
at
the
county
line
on
the
lake
in
austin
o
4
id
been
wanting
to
try
this
one
but
didnt
want
to
commit
myself
to
an
entire
6
pack
i
was
actually
much
more
pleased
than
i
thought
id
be
im
not
going
to
run
out
and
by
the
six
pack
but
im
not
mad
that
i
bought
this
at
the
restaurant
i
would
consider
drinking
it
again
flavors
are
toasted
malt
dark
chocolate
and
light
cherrypeaches
come
out
as
it
warms
this
one
is
a
nice
malty
holiday
treat
not
traditional
for
the
style
but
a
good
beer
overall
a
weird
beer
that
i
wouldnt
want
a
six
pack
of
sweet
with
the
perfect
amount
of
dry
bitterness
i
love
you
can
taste
the
pecans
not
so
much
the
peaches
i
love
almost
all
of
the
shiner
offerings
but
yet
will
tell
hold
nothing
back
just
cause
im
from
texas
i
feel
like
it
could
use
just
a
little
move
uph
but
thats
just
me
but
over
all
a
decent
beer
for
10
a
sixxer
perfect
beer
for
a
holiday
meal
though
the
peaches
and
pecans
cone
through
they
are
subtle
and
well
balanced
anyway
get
this
in
cans
if
available
and
enjoy
happy
thanksgiving
nice
and
fruity
without
being
overly
fruity
and
cloying
a
little
thin
throughout
but
i
was
actually
pleased
dont
think
of
spruce
and
cinnamon
this
beer
brings
out
the
holiday
spirit
with
peaches
and
pecans
a
real
nice
combo
its
not
too
heavy
so
you
will
enjoy
a
few
clean
aftertaste
happy
holidays
to
you
a
shiner
beer
i
really
like
the
pour
was
a
straw
yellow
with
a
good
head
the
smell
had
peach
and
pecan
but
also
what
smelled
like
belgian
wheat
which
gives
off
a
banana
scent
the
taste
was
nice
with
heavy
notes
such
as
bread
and
pecans
in
the
beginning
and
mellowing
out
with
the
semisweet
peach
coming
through
on
the
finish
very
enjoyable
interesting
beer
brewed
with
pecans
peaches
natural
flavor
and
caramel
color
aroma
is
of
faint
peach
and
malty
sweetness
flavor
has
the
malty
taste
and
a
hint
of
fresh
peaches
decent
mouthfeel
goes
down
well
and
leaves
a
little
pecan
flavor
at
the
end
getting
a
little
of
that
weird
dry
feeling
that
you
sometimes
get
when
eating
fresh
pecans
maybe
its
just
me
overall
pretty
well
balanced
and
a
nice
change
from
the
overly
dry
spiced
beers
that
are
abundant
around
the
holidays
overall
i
was
slightly
hesitant
to
try
a
cheer
beer
but
after
tasting
it
it
opened
up
a
whole
new
range
of
possibilities
in
the
future
in
other
words
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
i
would
recommend
i
drank
this
beer
after
a
cold
night
run
while
i
was
taking
a
hot
shower
theres
not
many
better
feelings
than
that
give
it
a
shot
o
the
descriptions
of
this
beer
sounded
very
intriguing
but
the
peach
flavor
is
a
bit
cloying
and
very
artificial
tasting
the
pecan
flavor
was
very
subtle
and
pleasant
it
is
certainly
a
oneofakind
beer
for
the
season
that
lacks
the
usual
holiday
spices
but
still
manages
to
evoke
the
season
its
unique
and
youve
got
to
give
them
credit
for
originality
additionally
i
feel
all
of
the
components
work
together
and
stand
out
at
least
a
little
bit
on
their
own
its
balanced
by
a
firm
bitterness
and
its
pretty
nicely
polished
its
certainly
worth
trying
o
id
have
it
again
but
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
nice
change
of
pace
3
415
i
was
prepared
to
be
disappointed
since
their
bock
the
only
other
shiner
beer
ive
had
is
a
poor
example
of
that
style
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
one
and
for
the
price
a
little
more
than
2
dollars
for
a
24
oz
bottle
it
is
one
of
the
tastiest
beers
ive
had
after
guzzling
this
one
im
going
back
for
more
love
the
fruity
notes
of
this
beer
always
look
forward
to
this
coming
out
first
time
i
tried
it
i
was
kind
of
like
no
not
really
but
once
i
got
it
on
tap
it
changed
my
mind
if
you
get
it
in
a
bottle
find
something
to
pour
it
in
as
it
improves
as
it
breaths
the
peach
and
pecan
are
right
there
in
your
face
best
experience
with
this
beer
was
on
a
rooftop
bar
when
it
was
snowing
tastes
like
captain
crunch
so
theres
that
going
for
it
drinkable
and
a
little
sweet
with
fruity
notes
throughout
nice
and
fruity
like
the
label
says
full
of
holiday
cheer
the
shiner
holiday
cheer
was
a
good
seasonal
beer
i
do
not
remember
everything
about
this
beer
it
has
been
so
long
since
i
have
had
it
but
from
what
i
do
remember
it
was
that
too
strong
or
too
light
for
a
seasonal
beer
it
was
actually
really
good
also
the
taste
of
this
beer
was
not
really
all
that
bad
actually
notes
this
is
an
amazingly
complex
and
wellbalanced
beer
from
the
spoetzl
brewery
a
weird
and
sweet
beer
this
is
more
like
a
dessert
drink
after
a
big
holiday
meal
this
beer
should
just
about
seal
the
deal
sotospeak
on
your
slumber
take
a
big
swig
of
this
whilst
downing
copious
amounts
of
aunt
bessies
triple
decker
cinnamon
plum
pudding
it
will
be
a
great
compliment
pours
a
dark
reddishamber
in
color
with
a
1finger
offwhite
foamy
head
that
settles
down
quickly
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
this
is
brewed
with
peaches
and
pecans
and
with
natural
flavor
and
caramel
color
love
the
aroma
when
first
opened
and
poured
as
the
peaches
and
caramel
hits
the
nose
nice
taste
of
peaches
with
wheat
flavor
with
spices
that
goes
down
easy
slight
sweet
aftertaste
that
isnt
bitter
one
of
the
better
shiners
in
my
opinion
pours
a
clear
dark
ruby
amber
with
a
well
formed
head
that
laces
well
said
lacing
lasts
only
a
few
minutes
however
nose
is
of
peach
over
a
slight
caramel
light
bodied
with
a
thin
mouthfeel
slightly
above
normal
carbonation
level
the
flavor
profile
is
not
complex
like
the
nose
it
is
peach
predominating
over
a
light
caramel
the
beginning
is
a
nice
peach
which
effervesces
into
an
ending
that
has
pecan
but
you
have
to
really
search
for
it
the
finish
is
a
lingering
taste
of
peach
that
is
ok
at
best
o
eh
its
ok
neat
idea
poorly
executed
overall
i
gave
it
a
2
75
on
this
as
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
fruit
flavored
beer
not
because
it
is
a
bad
brew
i
am
sure
that
the
brewer
achieved
what
he
was
going
after
overall
i
think
it
fits
into
its
style
but
i
would
rather
have
a
beer
that
has
more
beer
flavors
than
fruits
that
is
just
my
preference
overall
a
tasty
and
very
quaffable
beer
o
this
is
a
peach
soda
beer
its
onenote
but
the
flavor
is
not
artificial
and
its
easydrinking
12
ounce

almost
crystal

fairly
dense
light
khaki
head

to
a

that
lingers
slight
spotty

on

retaining
the
head
aromas
of

floral

and
herbal

nice
and
pleasant
aromas
with

on

a

flavors
with
zero
cloying

after
the
finish
medium
carbonation

a
fairly
creamy
smooth
and
slightly
syrupy
mouthfeel
that
is
good
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
minimal
warming
present
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
nice
fruited
dunkelweizen
good
balance
and
robustness
of
fruit
malt
and
yeast
flavors
and
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
not
what
i
was
expecting
but
i
enjoyed
this
beer
i
may
have
overrated
it
a
bit
but
i
would
have
it
again
for
sure
not
horrible
but
we
wouldnt
order
it
again
the
flavor
is
unique
and
delicious
peaches
big
peach
taste
you
can
some
what
taste
the
pecans
in
it
and
a
little
spice
of
some
sort
it
definitely
screams
christmas
unfortunately
is
is
a
seasonal
but
if
you
see
a
6
pack
in
the
store
during
the
holidays
it
is
a
must
to
try
with
friends
of
family
shiner
created
a
nice
easy
drinking
holiday
ale
the
peach
and
pecan
nuttiness
are
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
good
complexity
and
balance
with
a
unique
and
enjoyable
flavor
oh
well
a
good
enough
ale
with
a
soft
and
smooth
feel
o
not
enough
spice
for
a
holiday
brew
but
not
bad
at
all
o
definitely
enjoyable
delicious
without
being
over
the
top
pours
to
a
nice
buff
head
and
clear
brown
color
aroma
is
peachy
nutty
malty
and
grainy
no
hops
detected
flavor
is
bold
and
complex
with
bitter
pecan
peach
and
sweet
grain
notes
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
pleasingly
sticky
a
good
hearty
winter
brew
that
is
askew
but
tasty
one
of
those
beers
i
have
passed
over
about
a
million
times
without
realizing
what
i
was
missing
this
is
a
particularly
unique
brew
a
wheat
beer
that
features
both
pecans
and
peaches
a
refreshing
and
tasty
rewrite
of
holiday
beer
huge
peach
nose
is
very
authentic
not
real
nutty
but
fresh
and
juicy
in
front
of
medium
toasted
wheat
malt
i
really
like
the
subtle
spice
flavor
with
the
sweet
peach
its
like
real
good
iced
tea
from
the
south
could
maybe
use
a
little
more
hops
to
soften
the
sugar
but
i
like
how
different
this
is
the
pecans
add
an
earthy
richness
which
is
nice
with
the
grain
and
the
beer
is
robustly
carbonated
and
lively
on
the
palate
this
beer
deserves
more
credit
its
one
of
a
kind
and
among
the
very
best
ive
had
from
shiner
worthy
of
any
holiday
feast
i
may
make
this
a
tradition
this
is
lightmedium
bodied
it
starts
going
down
rather
quickly
but
the
carbonation
seems
to
create
some
drag
when
it
hits
the
back
of
the
tongue
overall
its
a
pleasant
effect
as
it
helps
keep
it
around
longer
for
the
flavor
o
its
a
shame
about
its
lack
of
balance
because
i
enjoy
the
fruity
flavors
of
this
wasnt
a
fan
of
this
one
frankly
on
the
plus
side
i
can
see
this
appealing
to
other
drinkers
overall
a
nice
light
peach
dunkel
that
might
be
better
during
the
warmer
months
but
surely
enjoyed
more
than
expected
would
have
been
nice
to
get
more
pecans
though
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
its
aroma
this
as
with
the
mouthfeel
enhanced
with
each
further
degree
that
the
liquid
warmed
we
were
then
better
able
to
appreciate
the
nuances
of
the
fruity
inclusions
and
the
inherent
spiciness
of
the
grain
bill
these
lent
to
each
other
well
for
a
balanced
blended
experience
we
felt
much
the
same
way
about
the
flavoring
with
fair
representation
from
each
corner
this
is
really
what
being
a
christmas
beer
should
be
all
about
with
richness
depth
warmth
and
a
touch
of
fun
all
of
this
actually
might
make
it
harder
for
one
to
indulge
all
by
themselves
as
at
points
we
wished
we
had
smaller
pours
but
that
just
lends
itself
to
the
spirit
of
the
holiday
so
go
find
someone
to
share
this
tasty
beer
with
overall
not
bad
i
would
drink
this
again
i
appreciate
that
this
beer
had
such
wonderful
patience
in
waiting
for
me
to
get
around
to
drinking
it
the
pour
began
to
foam
up
pretty
quickly
so
i
backed
off
and
let
the
pseudocascade
do
its
thing
before
settling
into
two
fingers
of
dense
lighttan
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
darkbrown
with

but
the
nose
was
just
redolent
with
peaches
peachy
keen
i
say
i
may
run
out
and
get
a
tastykake
peach
pie
after
this
mouthfeel
was
soft
kind
of
full
and
creamy
and
the
taste
was
heavy
on
the
peaches
but
with
a
nuttiness
also
finish
was
fruity
nutty
semisweet
but
not
over
the
top
man
i
could
drink
this
yearround
thankfully
the
alcohol
was
low
and
hardly
detectable
and
i
could
have
had
a
few
more
in
a
sitting
had
i
bought
more
than
one
bottle
the
roasted
nuttiness
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
would
have
liked
but
had
it
been
this
would
have
felt
like
a
brown
ale
as
it
was
this
was
enjoyable
on
its
own
even
though
it
paled
in
comparison
to
its
more
highlyrated
european
counterparts
some
may
feel
like
this
is
a
lighter
version
of
the
shiner
bock
but
for
the
holidays
this
would
be
a
good
choice
as
a
lighter
alternative
to

a
dunkelweizen
i
get
no
wheat
notes
and
only
a
very
mild
yeastiness
that
might
be
german
nope
call
it
a
fruit
beer
and
well
talk
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
just
ok
and
i
didnt
think
it
was
a
good
example
of
a
dunkelweizen
since
none
of
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
the
style
came
through
if
they
were
there
they
were
pretty
much
covered
up
by
the
creamy
peach
flavors
and
with
how
much
the
peach
flavors
stick
out
i
think
this
would
be
better
classified
as
a
fruit
beer
this
beer
didnt
have
the
best
drinkability
it
was
smooth
and
not
filling
but
the
taste
didnt
do
a
good
job
at
holding
my
attention
and
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
i
dont
really
have
the
urge
to
drink
another
one
in
a
row
what
i
liked
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
i
thought
they
were
both
nice
and
worked
well
with
this
beer
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
the
how
dominating
the
creamy
peach
flavors
were
they
werent
bad
but
i
thought
they
were
too
overpowering
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
again
im
glad
i
tried
it
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
and
i
dont
think
i
would
really
recommend
it
unless
you
really
like
peach
flavored
beers
all
in
all
i
was
a
little
let
down
with
this
beer
shiner
is
usually
pretty
solid
but
this
beer
seemed
a
little
too
unbalanced
and
artificial
for
my
taste
better
luck
next
time
guys
this
one
could
use
a
little
bit
of
work
o
this
seems
to
taste
more
like
a
fruitvegetable
beer
than
a
dunkelweizen
its
an
interesting
texan
take
on
a
holiday
beer
and
is
a
lot
easier
to
drink
than
some
of
the
other
holiday
beers
in
the
heavier
styles
such
as
winter
warmers
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
balance
between
the
peaches
and
pecansspices
because
the
beer
wasnt
overly
sweet
o
on
paper
the
peach
pecan
combo
should
work
quite
well
but
in
practice
it
tastes
candied
and
the
sweetness
is
out
of
balance
pours
a
dark
reddish
amber
with
a
thin
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
with
a
decent
amount
of
lacing
gives
off
the
aroma
of
beets
or
grapes
its
very
sweet
to
the
tongue
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
grapy
with
a
hint
of
beets
and
citrus
the
flavor
doesnt
last
long
however
and
youre
not
left
with
much
of
an
aftertaste
but
its
worth
a
try
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
to
a
friend
i
enjoyed
it
and
could
detect
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
never
did
taste
any
wheat
presence
either
bought
a
six
pack
and
poured
into
a
glass
not
much
head
pours
a
nice
reddish
orange
and
the
smell
is
fantastic
great
natural
flavored
peach
smell
but
when
it
comes
to
the
taste
there
is
not
much
peach
or
pecan
taste
at
all
tastes
like
a
regular
semi
dark
beer
im
very
disappointed
in
the
taste
not
sure
how
a
peachpecan
inspired
beer
has
anything
to
do
with
christmas
i
think
this
would
better
be
marketed
as
a
summer
type
beer
with
the
peach
thing
anyways
if
you
like
the
smell
of
peaches
this
thing
delivers
if
you
are
looking
for
a
peach
and
pecan
tasting
beer
forget
this
one
im
a
big
fan
of
shiner
beer
but
this
is
disappointing
the
perfect
christmas
beer
the
flavors
of
pecans
and
peaches
are
subtle
and
not
over
powering
like
that
crap
made
with
water
from
lake
michigan
this
is
a
truly
sessionable
christmas
beer
there
is
no
need
to
put
anything
girly
around
the
rim
of
the
glass
to
kill
the
taste
it
is
great
on
its
own
i
am
drinking
it
right
now
this
would
be
much
better
with
the
more
of
the
banana
taste
of
a
decent
dunkel
weizen
to
go
along
with
the
peach
sweetness
o
3
75
good
beer
unique
in
its
own
way
actually
works
out
better
than
i
thought
it
would
almost
like
a
dunkel
meets
a
roasty
toasty
english
brown
meets
a
fruit
beer
sweet
peach
juice
up
front
rolls
into
other
dark
fruits
along
the
midpalate
and
some
weizen
flare
creamy
body
but
not
too
heavy
prickly
carbonation
just
enough
bitterness
on
the
back
end
with
a
big
roasted
malt
and
toasted
bread
flavor
to
balance
the
sweetness
toasty
flavors
linger
on
the
palate
it
does
finish
a
little
soapy
however
with
what
feels
like
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
which
is
strange
for
such
a
flavorful
beer
at
a
low
abv
but
overall
it
is
definitely
something
different
for
the
holidays
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
dunkelweizen
however
it
is
a
very
unique
take
on
a
fruit
beer
that
combines
some
other
interesting
traits
from
other
styles
something
you
can
have
a
few
of
with
a
unique
flavor
a
simply
unique
seasonal
christmas
beer
living
in
ne
ohio
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
enjoy
great

ale
and

of

however
shiner
cheer
from
texas
has
become
our
favorite
holiday
beer
surpassing
all
the
fantastic
beers
we
are
able
to
enjoy
in
ohio
additionally
the
branding
and
color
permutation
of
the
label
may
be
the
best
out
there
so
cool
and
so
glad
this
beer
has

is

with
plenty
of
fruit
light
bready

accentuated
with

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff

by

taste
at
the
end
sweet
peachy
aftertaste
wish
there
was
just
a
little
more

to
this
for
a

it

and
would
go
well
with

pours
a
clear

with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
partial

on

of
the
beer
foamy
streaks
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
toasted
malt
peaches
and
a
slight
nutty
aroma
taste
is
much
the
same
with
peach
and
apricot
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
fairly
interesting
with
the
peach
and
pecan
combo
going
on
o
this
is
an
incredibly
unique
and
funky
take
on
a
christmas
beer
or
even
a
dunklewizen
in
general
indeed
this
is
the
most
unique
dunkleweizen
i
have
ever
had
maybe
its
a
texas
thing
but
nothing
about
this
beer
really
says
christmas
to
me
for
this
reason
i
find
it
funny
when
people
tell
me
that
this
beer
is
a
bad
winter
warmer
of
course
its
a
bad
winter
warmer
because
its
not
one
the
disappointing
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
really
not
sessionalbe
at
least
for
me
this
is
more
of
a
1
and
done
kind
of
beer
which
is
really
unfitting
considering
how
low
of
an
abv
it
has
still
kudos
on
your
creativity
shiner
and
making
a
beer
that
slightly
stands
out
from
the
rest
during
the
holiday
season
overall
this
is
the
second
beer
ive
had
that
has
been
brewed
with
pecans
personally
it
doesnt
seem
to
me
to
have
a
strong
enough
flavor
to
come
through
in
the
beer
i
got
this
brew
in
a
gift
basket
so
i
was
happy
to
try
it
however
i
wont
be
buying
this
in
a
6pack
at
the
very
least
this
one
sounds
interesting
shiner
cheer
pours
out
a
red
color
with
a
decent
head
the
aroma
comes
strong
with
the
peaches
the
taste
comes
really
hard
with
the
peaches
too
theres
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
just
a
tiny
amount
of
spices
on
the
finish
but
otherwise
this
is
a
onenote
peach
fest
unique
enough
and
pretty
tasty
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
lightly
carbonated
overall
shiner
cheer
is
a
solid
and
unique
winter
beer
however
stay
far
far
away
if
the
idea
of
a
primarily
peach
flavored
beer
doesnt
tickle
your
fancy
o
what
a
let
down
the
nose
was
good
but
lacked
in
taste
completely
all
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
cheap
replica
of
a
great
beer
style
i
wont
be
cheering
next
year
overall
a
decent
holiday
beer
with
a
major
peach
influence
the
flavor
is
genuine
and
everything
more
or
less
works
a
bit
light
and
confused
but
still
quite
drinkable
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
reddish
brown
color
with
an
off
white
head
on
top
the
retention
is
thin
and
there
isnt
any
lacing
the
smell
of
the
beer
to
me
was
really
impressive
i
poured
out
and
was
overwhelmed
by
the
peach
in
it
the
smell
is
sweet
like
candy
and
wont
appeal
to
most
beer
lovers
out
there
the
taste
is
also
sweet
again
with
peaches
i
wish
the
nuts
came
out
a
little
more
the
mouthfeel
is
very
drinkable
and
easy
going
not
bitter
at
all
or
cloying
overall
despite
its
artificial
aromas
and
flavors
that
it
more
than
likely
has
its
still
a
really
good
tasting
beer
in
my
opinion
i
would
prefer
it
if
it
wasnt
artificial
at
all
and
all
natural
but
either
way
i
enjoy
this
beer
i
feel
its
a
bit
too
clear
to
be
a
traditional
dunkelweizen
as
well
all
in
all
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
though
sidenote
the
beer
definitely
improves
as
it
warms
the
flavor
profile
gains
in
nuts
and
maltiness
which
does
a
better
job
of
balancing
the
peach
tartness
clear
mahogany
pour
with
one
finger
head
that
fades
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
nutty
fruity
nose
with
subtle
hints
of
peaches
along
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
taste
is
dominated
by
the
sweet
malt
with
hints
of
peaches
toffee
and
maple
syrup
the
mouthfeel
is
syrupy
and
sickly
sweet
the
description
of
this
beer
sounded
interesting
but
shiner
definitely
didnt
pull
it
off
way
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
mouthfeel
is
probably
about
right
but
overall
i
feel
like
shiner
is
just
doing
a
bit
with
this
and
i
cant
take
it
seriously
this
beer
tastes
10x
better
on
tap
than
bottle
the
bottle
taste
reminds
me
of
sour
milk
on
the
after
taste
have
you
ever
tasted
your
own
ear
wax
well
after
drinking
this
you
might
be
able
to
recall
that
now
why
i
say
ear
wax
well
i
tasted
my
ear
wax
numerous
times
out
of
curiosity
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
id
rather
bum
off
someone
else
o
not
my
cup
of
tea
too
much
like
drinking
a
candy
overall
a
bit
below
average
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
one
again
this
seems
to
be
more
of
a
fruit
beer
the
peaches
are
nice
though
the
wheat
shows
on
the
fell
more
than
the
flavor
this
could
be
a
great
summertime
beer
as
well
an
interesting
holiday
beer
it
was
worth
trying
but
probably
not
one
i
will
revisit
a
must
try
if
you
like
peach
flavored
beers
an
interesting
diversion
and
one
of
the
better
shiner
beers
that
ive
had
o
malt
forward
xmas
beer
fruity
and
somewhat
respectable
without
being
overbearing
spice
wise
oim
kind
of
glad
i
bought
this
something
a
little
different
and
while
not
an
alltime
great
its
interesting
enough
o
disappointing
is
the
name
of
this
beer
if
youre
really
into
peachy
flavors
and
thin
beer
go
for
it
but
if
youre
looking
for
an
actual
dunkel
steer
clear
of
this
one
overall
while
a
little
too
fruity
and
sweet
for
the
style
it
was
actually
a
very
tasty
brew
easy
to
drink
and
one
to
go
to
from
time
to
time
o
the
addition
of
peaches
to
a
holiday
beer
is
an
interesting
but
completely
successful
it
leaves
the
beer
a
little
too
sweet
especially
in
the
smell
it
goes
down
pretty
easily
but
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
im
having
a
difficult
time
describing
the
very
distinctive
nonbeer
flavor
maybe
its
just
the
holiday
in
the
title
but
it
does
have
a
yuletide
feel
i
think
this
one
should
be
in
the
fruitvegetable
category
if
this
is
a
dunkelweizen
its
well
disguised
from
the
12
oz
bottle
bought
at
pinkies
in
san
angelo
serving
type
bottle
overall
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
i
look
forward
to
it
every
year
i
might
love
it
less
if
it
was
available
year
round
but
drinking
a
few
sixpacks
in
the
winter
months
is
a
blast
perfect
for
christmas
parties
for
bas
and
beernormies
alike
overall
a
nice
tasty
change
of
pace
holiday
beer
my
biggest
gripe
is
that
ive
had
it
3
years
in
a
row
and
the
taste
changes
every
single
time
i
would
prefer
more
consistency
taste
is
toasted
bread
faintly
caramelized
plus
light
woodypeppery
bitterness
hint
of
nuttiness
peach
is
noticeable
but
barely
so
being
very
faint
unlike
in
the
aroma
finish
has
light
nutty
caramelised
toasted
bread
overall
it
is
fairly
dry
balanced
it
is
good
enjoyable
and
solid
its
a
little
different
too
and
in
a
way
that
works
well
feel
is
light
but
not
watery
o
not
a
bad
beer
on
a
cold
winter
night
with
some
dessert
it
would
be
more
appealing
overall
a
good
value
with
decent
flavor
for
an
inexpensive
fruit
beer
from
shiner
ov
great
winter
warmer
with
a
very
fun
profile
full
bodied
and
very
warm
i
have
a
texas
license
but
im
not
a
texan
maybe
that
explains
why
i
dont
love
shiner
its
better
than
the
standard
aal
and
this
is
completely
unique
and
better
than
the
bock
but
shiner
still
isnt
great
in
my
book
o
i
was
monumentally
surprised
at
the
changes
in
shc
for
11
it
was
a
delight
it
was
impressive
and
will
replace
all
other
cozy
holiday
beverages
in
my
household
overall
this
is
my
first
time
trying
this
style
of
beer
i
like
it
its
a
lot
different
from
other
styles
i
wouldnt
be
able
to
drink
a
lot
of
this
though
because
its
so
sweet
o
not
what
i
enjoy
in
a
holiday
beer
but
a
good
novelty
beer
for
noncraft
beer
drinkers
oi
was
throughly
impressed
by
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
the
peach
flavor
along
w
the
other
flavor
combinations
when
i
had
this
on
tap
they
rimmed
the
glass
w
brown
sugar
and
cinnamon
fantastic
i
copied
this
at
home
as
well
on
a
couple
bottles
one
of
my
favorite
shockingly
holiday
releases
this
is
a
unique
brew
i
would
not
have
expected
it
for
a
holiday
brew
maybe
its
southernstyle
though
and
its
certainly
not
typical
for
a
dunkelweizen
anyway
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
brew
with
a
refreshing
peach
and
pecan
character
12
oz
bottle
into
a
9
oz
glass
pours
a
dark
red
with
a
small
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
lacing
remains
smell
of
peaches
is
dominant
but
is
very
appealing
peaches
also
dominate
the
taste
but
not
overly
powerful
that
it
will
offend
goes
down
really
smooth
and
leaves
no
real
bad
aftertaste
overall
a
good
holiday
beer
that
can
be
a
session
beer
overall
although
this
beer
is
light
and
drinkable
the
gimmicky
candysweet
fruitiness
is
not
something
to
come
back
to
d
this
had
an
unusual
scent
and
taste
for
a
holiday
beer
but
it
was
clean
and
enjoyable
the
peach
character
didnt
mix
with
the
copper
taste
too
well
and
the
pecan
wasnt
very
noticeable
but
it
was
still
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
great
o
overall
its
not
that
bad
but
i
would
basically
buy
it
for
a
holiday
party
where
not
a
lot
of
people
are
craft
beer
drinkers
because
this
beer
isnt
that
intense
i
would
rather
have
a
sierra
nevadas
celebration
in
the
fridge
for
a
holiday
type
beer
this
is
a
nice
twist
on
a
the
winter
beer
rather
than
some
heavy
rich
spiced
beer
shiner
made
a
delicious
sweet
almost
dessertlike
beer
this
is
a
welcomed
change
of
pace
rjt
o
though
i
dont
care
for
spoetzls
beers
i
ususally
tend
to
enjoy
their
seasonal
beers
but
this
one
really
let
me
down
i
dont
get
the
whole
peach
in
winter
thing
just
doesnt
make
sense
to
me
o
really
nice
aroma
not
sure
how
they
pulled
off
the
peach
but
im
impressed
not
really
getting
the
dunkelweizen
character
but
for
what
it
is
its
tasty
o
this
is
one
of
the
better
holiday
beers
ive
had
good
flavors
and
aromas
blend
well
together
overall
i
thought
this
was
great
holiday
beer
o
overall
a
sad
letdown
as
to
what
i
hoped
it
would
be
the
name
sounded
festive
and
like
haveing
a
good
time
but
sadly
that
was
not
the
case
here
o
at
first
i
absolutely
hated
it
the
aftertaste
is
definitely
peaches
and
that
isnt
a
terrible
thing
as
a
recommendation
id
say
you
have
to
have
it
once
if
find
the
aroma
of
this
beer
the
best
part
and
better
than
the
flavor
but
i
like
it
overall
its
a
refreshing
break
from
the
more
heavy
and
spiced
winter
ales
o
eh
smells
way
to
sweet
and
tastes
almost
as
sweet
i
guess
this
is
good
for
holiday
parties
or
something
i
wont
compare
to
the
scuttlebutt
since
they
were
less
similar
than
i
had
hoped
they
would
be
overall
a
great
specialty
beer
i
wouldnt
have
this
every
night
but
definately
in
the
winter
overall
its
not
something
i
would
drink
all
the
time
but
one
season
out
of
the
year
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
also
it
has
all
the
qualities
that
it
professes
on
the
label
you
get
exactly
what
youre
promised
and
its
worth
including
in
your
winter
beer
lineup
is
this
a
gateway
beer
for
macrolager
drinkers
as
some
have
suggested
only
if
they
really
want
to
drink
artificially
sweet
candy
flavored
beer
that
mocks
its
supposed
progenitor
i
dont
need
a
beer
with
natural
flavors
added
or
caramel
color
added
and
this
one
has
both
essentially
cloying

an

on
a

im

at
some
of

gets
in

i

innovation
is

appreciated
in
the
trendy

sure
theres
better
dunkelweizens
out
there
but
all
the

make
it

the

is
definitely
a

pretty

i

the

i

the

im

its

a

would

this
is
too

of
a
peach
wallop
the
nuttiness
and
alcohol
try
to
reign
in

but
they
fail
its
an
interesting
beer
but
not
one
ill
naturally
turn
to
at
christmas
time
d
more
impressive
than
i
had
thought
for
some
reason
shiner
is
everywhere
in
california
and
for
cheap
me
likey
sad
thing
is
that
i
am
not
so
much
a
fan
of
this
beer
to
be
true
to
the
ba
code
i
am
supposed
to
compare
this
to
a
dunkelweiss
but
i
cant
because
this
is
a
stretch
comparing
this
to
the
other
winter
beers
this
one
was
a
bit
much
on
the
drinking
a
cake
thing
yes
you
get
a
pecan
flavor
and
peaches
but
really
not
the
best
in
a
beer
poured
dark
little
head
sweet
candy
taste
overall
this
was
ok
not
bad
they
did
explain
the
beer
on
the
bottle
and
it
tasted
like
it
said
not
a
bad
drinker
but
really
one
is
enough
a
little
two
sweet
and
filling
to
drink
more
than
one
d
flavorful
and
drinkable
the
dominant
light
fruit
sweetness
hinder
sessionablity
if
you
like
peaches
and
pecans
i
cant
imagine
you
not
enjoying
this
beer
and
heres
the
kicker
i
dont
even
like
peaches
its
drinkable
provided
you
like
the
taste
of
peaches
notes
this
is
certainly
a
unique
brew
i
like
peaches
so
i
enjoyed
it
but
if
you
dont
care
for
canned
peaches
then
watch
out
ill
at
least
have
a
few
bottles
next
holiday
season
drinkability
easy
to
drink
though
not
something
i
would
want
to
have
again
overall
i
am
glad
to
get
my
hands
on
this
beer
for
the
abv
its
both
smooth
and
delicious
bottle
poured
out
a
dark
amber
color
not
very
big
head
it
smells
slightly
fruity
you
can
pick
up
the
hint
of
peach
the
taste
is
less
peach
and
more
pecan
but
it
finishes
slightly
fruity
and
a
little
bitter
i
didnt
hate
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
there
are
definitely
better
seasonal
options
out
there
pours
dark
red
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
is
strong
peaches
and
maybe
some
pecans
flavor
is
pecan
caramel
malt
and
peaches
quite
a
bit
of
nuttyness
in
the
flavor
and
it
finishes
slightly
bitter
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
i
think
this
is
targeted
towards
macro
drinkers
but
it
is
an
interesting
beer
anyway
not
bad
overall
d
easily
sessionable
if
you
dig
the
flavor
combo
dont
think
i
could
do
2
myself
interesting
take
on
a
holiday
beer
i
took
my
first
smell
and
sip
expecting
the
holiday
spice
cabinet
as
i
had
not
yet
read
the
label
and
found
the
peach
flavor
to
be
a
nice
change
from
the
usual
holiday
beers
dribnkability
decent
beer
overall
quite
drinkable
and
a
light
refreshing
beer
for
the
holiday
season
would
go
well
with
pecan
pie
or
a
christmas
dinner
sweet
peach
molasses
honey
and
spice
in
the
aroma
this
holiday
brew
really
has
a
nice
nose
to
it
body
is
a
bit
thin
but
the
peaches
and
roasted
nuts
come
into
play
with
the
quaff
on
the
sweet
side
esp
for
a
winter
holiday
brew
this
could
use
more
spice
and
hops
but
all
in
all
not
too
bad
of
a
drinking
brew
might
be
tough
to
work
through
a
sixer
in
a
sitting
though
cola
peaches
strawberries
caramel
and
pecans
are
dominant
on
the
tongue
along
with
a
touch
of
nutmeg
and
chocolate
its
very
sweet
and
syrupy
though
the
body
is
thin
and
carbonation
high
it
finishes
on
a
dry
note
with
some
lingering
bitterness
cherry
coke
and
peach
this
is
strange
unsettling
stuff
its
like
a
sodabeer
hybrid
if
youre
the
type
of
person
that
adds
shots
of
vodka
to
their
rc
cola
you
may
enjoy
this
but
otherwise
its
best
avoided
overall
no
where
near
what
i
was
expecting
i
didnt
read
the
label
when
i
grabed
this
beer
lesson
learned
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
just
not
a
typical
holiday
beer
unique
for
sure
d
if
it
were
me
i
would
have
filed
this
beer
under
winter
warmer
as
the
peach
and
nut
character
are
the
true
centerpiece
not
the
very
faint
weizen
flavors
overall
quite
drinkable
im
glad
i
picked
it
up
quite
an
odd
beer
probably
worth
trying
for
the
experience
if
you
can
split
a
single
bottle
with
someone
else
a
full
12oz
bottle
was
a
bit
much
of
this
for
me
and
i
have
no
desire
to
get
more
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
sticky
rich
and
creamy
finish
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
i
really
like
this
beer
it
has
a
roundness
to
the
flavor
and
a
nice
supple
finish
this
is
a
wonderful
easy
drinking
beer
very
interesting
and
rather
drinkable
though
the
finish
is
perhaps
a
bit
too
astringent
peaches
are
not
the
sort
of
fruit
i
generally
think
of
when
it
comes
to
winter
though
having
been
born
and
raised
in
the
peach
state
on
the
site
of
an
old
pecan
plantation
i
do
very
much
enjoy
both
peaches
and
pecans
and
the
combination
in
a
beer
is
pleasant
unexpected
and
uncommon
certainly
recommended
overall
id
suggest
this
beer
to
any
of
my
friends
cheers
overall
impression
a
very
artifical
confusing
ale
not
sure
what
to
think
of
it
but
it
just
tasted
industrial
and
artificial
avoid
probably
too
harsh
on
this
its
a
good
value
for
the
price
but
i
guess
ive
been
spoiled
by
shiners
other
recent
offerings
like
commemorator
pours
is
copper
lager
clear
with
as
small
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
nose
is
that
initial
cereal
ive
found
in
other
shiners
after
it
sits
a
very
prominent
strawberry
palate
is
sweet
not
much
wheat
character
not
much
of
anything
besides
the
fruit
citrus
of
a
strawberry
then
a
overly
hoppy
and
im
not
saying
its
actually
a
hoppy
beer
but
no
balance
at
all
as
for
malt
character
interaction
quite
plain
might
have
been
decent
if
it
wasnt
clear
crisp
not
bready
dense
not
as
misplaced
yeast
as
some
of
the
other
shiners
definitely
not
a
dukelweizen
so
dont
try
if
thats
what
youre
hoping
for
this
beer
is
not
sweet
like
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
which
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
would
probably
spend
6
bucks
on
a
22oz
rogue
style
bottle
but
luckily
it
is
that
price
for
a
6
pack
very
good
deal
and
very
good
beer
the
flavor
is
very
complex
and
the
peachcreamcaramel
comes
first
with
the
hop
bitterness
next
both
flavors
then
lighten
up
also
the
beer
is
very
carbonated
best
beer
that
i
have
had
from
shiner
they
did
a
great
job
brewing
this
beer
drinkability
interesting
stuff
going
on
but
1
bottle
was
all
that
i
could
handle
worth
a
shot
but
nothing
really
sessionable
about
this
brew
and
really
not
much
of
a
dunkelweizen
sweetness
and
the
extent
of
the
peach
is
a
bit
too
much
for
this
beer
enthusiast
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
thin
with
a
light
to
moderate
carbonation
giving
it
a
crisp
bite
holiday
cheer
indeed
tastefresh
peaches
dark
malts
and
wheat
subtle
roasted
pecans
that
just
balance
out
the
sweetness
of
the
peaches
nicely
balanced
as
a
little
peach
essence
goes
a
long
way
but
this
brew
seems
to
get
it
right
flavor
is
not
cloying
but
rather
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
offeringcertainly
worth
a
try
oh
god
the
peaches
its
not
so
much
that
the
peach
flavor
is
all
that
bad
in
fact
its
one
of
the
more
naturaltasting
fruit
flavors
in
a
fruit
beer
that
ive
tried
but
its
just
extremely
peachy
like
someone
mixed
peach
preserves
and
beer
the
smell
is
particularly
peachy
literally
rather
than
figuratively
the
flavor
is
like
a
cross
between
a
strawberry
soda
a
light
possibly
decent
dunkelweizen
and
a
giant
bowl
of
peaches
and
a
trace
of
bile
but
i
hate
a
lot
of
sweet
fruit
beers
ive
never
really
associated
peaches
with
the
holiday
season
so
it
leaves
me
a
bit
confused
maybe
its
a
texas
thing
also
if
anyone
can
taste
pecan
in
this
beer
my
hat
is
off
to
you
its
really
not
a
horrible
beer
i
guess
but
its
not
my
thing
alright
so
this
is
my
first
review
and
i
am
partial
to
dunkelweizen
but
this
beer
was
very
interesting
the
peach
notes
are
obvious
from
the
moment
you
open
the
bottle
and
the
pecan
is
tasted
from
the
first
sip
while
this
isnt
my
first
rodeo
i
did
appreciate
the
subtleness
from
the
first
note
onward
while
this
isnt
the
best
dunkel
ive
had
i
have
been
enjoying
it
thoroughly
all
i
can
say
is
the
description
on
the
bottle
has
been
accurate
and
isnt
going
to
disappoint
after
reading
about
this
a
christmas
or
two
ago
this
is
my
first
sampling
and
i
must
admit
this
is
like
finding
a
surprise
package
under
the
tree
i
have
never
tasted
an
ale
like
this
one
before
the
use
of
peaches
and
pecans
gives
this
a
unique
flavor
profile
which
is
neither
dry
nor
sweet
but
has
bit
of
tartness
in
the
finish
getting
over
the
initial
flavor
shock
this
becomes
a
very
tasty
drinkable
beer
a
krausend
5
4
delight
if
you
see
it
grab
at
least
one
bottle
to
try
the
interesting
peach
component
makes
this
pretty
unique
at
least
from
a
tx
brewer
a
good
christmas
beer
although
im
not
sure
its
a
dunkel
not
a
very
desirable
beer
by
any
means
and
definately
a
stretch
calling
this
a
dunkelweiss
i
must
admit
peach
isnt
a
flavor
im
fond
of
in
beer
im
glad
i
only
bought
a
single
bottle
of
this
i
applaud
the
creative
spin
on
a
holiday
beer
but
its
just
not
my
bag
not
sure
if
i
would
buy
it
again
or
not
d
this
is
a
nice
beer
the
fruity
peach
flavors
remind
me
of
a
summer
beer
while
the
full
body
and
toasted
malts
are
more
of
a
fall
feel
overall
the
beer
works
but
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
to
someone
who
doesnt
like
sweet
fruity
beers
i
drank
all
right
away
cause
that
was
about
the
only
enjoyment
i
got
from
them
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
holiday
spiced
ales
they
are
mostly
over
the
top
with
artificial
flavors
however
this
one
dispite
its
weird
smell
is
quite
nice
i
could
do
a
couple
of
these
during
the
holidays
or
any
other
days
it
would
be
nice
with
a
slice
of
pecan
pie
which
reminds
me
i
didt
even
notice
the
pecans
poured
a
clear
fizzy
amber
color
with
a
creamy
off
white
head
and
good
lacing
smells
of
artificial
peaches
nutty
bready
taste
is
about
as
it
smells
huge
peach
flavor
but
not
in
a
good
way
it
taste
way
too
artificial
and
sweet
light
to
medium
oily
body
one
is
definably
enough
to
drink
in
one
sitting
i
dont
believe
i
will
drink
this
again
to
tell
you
the
truth
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelveounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
twistoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
an
interesting
beer
and
not
bad
im
glad
to
have
shiner
trying
offerings
like
this
and
i
think
id
drink
a
few
again
next
winter
drinkability
i
dont
get
it
the
union
of
peaches
and
pecans
alongside
a
dunkelweizen
which
is
as
much
a
proper
dunkelweizen
as
shiner
bock
is
a
bock
is
totally
lost
on
me
this
just
isnt
what
im
looking
for
in
a
fruit
beer
winter
beer
or
dunkelweizen
shiner
holiday
cheer
is
a
unique
beer
that
gets
points
for
originality
on
the
other
hand
only
peachophiles
will
love
it
since
im
not
one
i
dont
heres
hoping
the
boys
at
spoetzl
come
up
with
something
completely
different
this
coming
holiday
season
overall
i
loved
the
smell
of
this
beer
but
the
taste
did
not
match
it
for
me
that
killed
the
experience
a
little
bit
if
they
added
some
sugar
to
increase
sweetness
and
found
a
way
to
make
that
nutty
pecan
smell
come
through
in
the
taste
this
beer
would
be
downright
awesome
pours
a
clear
dark
amber
color
34
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
great
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
fruit
peaches
tart
malt
some
caramel
a
hint
of
all
spice
and
slight
alcohol
fits
the
style
of
a
dunkelweizen
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
peaches
and
earthy
malt
up
front
a
strong
dryness
is
present
after
the
initial
sip
a
slight
hop
background
is
barely
noticeable
and
a
strong
peachbiscuit
flavor
dominates
the
finish
overall
not
a
very
good
dunkelweizen
i
would
not
recommend
this
brew
unless
youre
trying
to
find
a
decent
peach
flavored
beer
medium
mouthfeel
and
smooth
with
a
malty
sweetness
in
the
front
and
some
balancing
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
there
is
some
bite
from
the
carbonation
and
a
little
punch
from
the
alcohol
i
cant
really
decide
if
the
flavor
is
to
style
or
not
but
it
is
pleasing
good
beer
unlike
anything
that
ive
had
a
little
sweet
overall
but
definitely
a
flavorful
and
interesting
beer
the
odd
combination
of
pecans
and
peaches
in
a
beer
really
works
here
while
it
seems
to
be
just
what
spoetzl
was
going
for
its
not
a
beer
for
me
i
guess
im
not
a
big
fan
of
peaches
in
beer
this
is
a
love
it
or
hate
it
kind
of
beer
i
am
not
a
huge
shiner
fan
but
i
really
dig
this
beer
they
really
stepped
out
of
their
comfort
zone
with
this
one
and
i
could
not
be
happier
they
did
so
an
odd
choice
for
a
holiday
beer
yes
but
is
it
delicious
hell
yea
damn
near
chuggable
i
freaking
went
through
over
a
case
of
this
and
hope
they
release
it
again
next
year
important
to
note
that
it
does
not
age
well
as
it
really
loses
the
peachy
brightness
of
the
beer
clear
red
brown
very
dense
light
tan
head
possible
tiny
reindeer
tracks
in
the
head
but
i
cant
be
sure
smell
is
very
fruity
peaches
oranges
lemons
bananas
cherries
and
peaches
im
serious
this
smells
like
a
soothie
taste
follows
suit
very
sweet
with
oranges
and
vanilla
it
tastes
like
one
of
those
orange
cream
candies
interesting
i
would
have
a
very
hard
time
classing
this
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
drinkability
is
excellent
you
could
just
suck
these
down
all
christmas
eve
until
you
went
glucose
intolerant
to
sum
it
up
i
have
little
to
no
idea
what
to
make
of
this
overall
impression
its
different
but
overall
not
all
that
interesting
that
being
said
there
is
nothing
overtly
bad
about
it
and
im
sure
ill
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
six
pack
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
ever
had
this
is
also
the
best
shiner
beer
i
have
ever
had
a
great
job
and
an
excellent
beer
thanks
to
deuane
for
picking
me
up
a
few
bottles
of
this
while
out
in
state
college
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
coolest
retro
looking
bottle
of
beer
that
ive
ever
come
across
right
down
to
the
cap
seems
like
it
jumped
out
of
a
time
machine
from
the
50s
cheers
to
the
graphic
artists
that
designed
the
artwork
for
this
beer
poured
into
my
nonic
pint
glass
a
clear
deep
brown
amber
color
reminiscent
of
cream
soda
with
barely
a
finger
of
off
white
foam
smells
of
toasted
grain
and
fresh
sweet
peaches
tastes
of
creamy
caramel
malt
fresh
peaches
and
a
pleasant
nutty
bitterness
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
very
tasty
and
different
take
on
a
holiday
beer
well
done
overall
a
drinkable
if
odd
dunkel
flavor
is
not
as
unified
as
i
would
prefer
another
boring
fruit
beer
where
is
all
the
dunkelweizen
goodness
pours
a
clear
amber
body
with
a
billowybubbly
lightly
brown
head
the
smell
is
very
interesting
its
very
berry
like
fruity
fruit
punch
with
a
hint
of
saaz
hops
i
think
graipfruit
pine
smell
taste
is
interesting
lots
of
different
fruits
going
on
peachy
for
sure
the
dominant
flavor
is
the
grapefruit
pine
hops
it
could
use
a
little
for
malt
up
front
to
match
the
hops
mouth
feel
is
light
a
carbonated
drinkability
is
average
maybe
not
a
session
beer
but
you
could
do
a
sixpack
in
one
night
this
might
be
my
favorite
xmass
beer
because
its
not
super
high
alcohol
not
super
heavy
and
not
heavily
spiced
an
orange
yellow
color
with
a
slight
white
head
the
peach
comes
right
to
the
front
with
added
smells
of
apricot
and
cherry
very
refreshing
in
taste
with
the
peach
being
a
subtle
flavor
that
blends
well
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
i
like
this
beer
simple
but
good
solid
holiday
beer
from
a
place
you
wouldnt
necessarily
expect
it
from
d
the
added
peach
flavor
really
detracts
from
drinkability
however
this
beer
has
enough
character
to
be
a
delight
all
by
itselfrather
than
paired
with
a
meal
its
a
better
than
average
beer
but
not
great
or
even
good
its
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
usual
beers
and
is
an
easy
drinker
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
i
wouldnt
drink
this
again
if
i
had
to
d
not
to
bad
not
something
id
have
all
the
time
d
i
still
cant
over
how
much
peach
flavor
was
in
this
beer
even
after
some
time
of
having
a
sip
the
flavor
still
sits
very
sweetly
in
my
mouth
i
cant
see
having
more
then
one
at
a
sitting
taste
is
somewhat
watery
tangy
dark
fruit
some
cherry
malt
and
spice
flatting
out
quite
quickly
end
is
slightly
dry
poured
a
medium
reddishbrown
color
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
peaches
and
some
roasted
nuttiness
the
nuts
were
in
the
background
at
first
but
came
out
more
as
i
drank
tastes
of
peaches
nuts
and
caramel
medium
sweet
lots
of
peaches
i
just
tried
this
new
shiner
beer
last
night
before
the
alamo
bowl
in
san
antonio
definately
has
a
holiday
taste
to
it
i
normally
dont
like
fruity
beers
but
this
one
has
a
lot
of
flavour
i
dont
find
it
nearly
as
good
as
sierra
nevadas
celebration
ale
a
bit
sweeter
but
still
you
ought
to
try
it
id
just
had
about
4
plates
of
texmex
food
mostly
marinated
chicken
to
make
some
fajitas
with
and
this
ended
the
meal
on
a
positive
note
dlow
this
beer
is
overly
fruity
making
a
beer
thats
a
bit
too
onedimensional
focusing
on
the
fruit
while
seemingly
leaving
the
rest
of
the
beer
behind
drinkability
overall
i
would
have
to
say
fairly
good
drinkability
i
like
combination
of
the
pecan
and
peach
flavor
it
is
a
sweeter
brew
but
its
a
nice
seasonal
type
variety
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
very
nice
im
going
to
hide
one
of
these
away
for
the
4th
of
july
dwow
a
different
take
on
a
holiday
brew
with
peaches
and
pecans
a
nice
southern
twist
from
shiner
this
one
is
a
winner
imho
i
really
like
the
fresh
real
peach
taste
combined
with
the
tannic
dryness
from
the
pecans
a
well
balanced
and
flavourful
brew
wish
i
had
more
of
this
one
although
they
call
this
a
dunkleweizen
i
find
no
dunkle
or
weizen
in
here
at
all
regardless
i
enjoyed
it
merry
christmas
2008happy
holidayskwanzaa
hannukah
etc
ba
and
thanks
for
the
bottle
dr
brad
wheres
the
beer
this
is
pretty
strange
very
nondunkelweizen
if
you
like
really
sweet
fruity
alcoholic
beverages
though
this
one
is
for
you
it
wasnt
bad
really
i
could
have
gone
for
multiple
in
a
session
no
problem
but
there
is
always
other
beer
to
check
out
i
hope
if
shiner
offers
a
holiday
cheer
next
year
they
experiment
in
another
direction
ill
be
sure
to
pick
it
up
if
i
see
it
normally
im
not
a
fan
of
fruit
beers
but
this
one
was
really
enjoyable
surprisingly
so
actually
when
i
first
smelled
the
beer
and
the
sweetness
to
it
i
figured
it
would
be
like
drinking
fruit
juice
mixed
with
beer
it
was
nothing
like
that
i
found
this
rather
enjoyable
to
drink
d
the
peach
flavor
is
novel
but
im
not
compelled
to
have
more
ill
add
the
bottle
to
my
christmas
collection
but
im
think
im
pretty
much
done
o
wouldnt
be
that
bad
if
the
peach
flavor
wasnt
so
freaking
overwhelming
a
one
trick
pony
drinkability
very
high
thanks
to
the
bubbles
and
they
help
remove
the
stickiness
typically
left
from
a
beer
like
this
i
really
enjoy
the
taste
despite
the
peaches
seeming
more
like
a
summer
fruit
i
think
this
is
an
excellent
accompaniment
to
holiday
celebrations
drinkability
maybe
its
just
a
fad
but
im
digging
this
beer
and
contemplating
a
few
more
sixers
to
share
around
the
family
and
hood
kudos
to
hawkinmi
for
alerting
me
to
these
babies
over
in
nky
d
very
smooth
texture
but
the
sweetness
and
peach
flavor
are
quite
out
of
balance
probably
couldnt
drink
more
than
two
at
a
time
would
go
really
well
with
desert
however
pours
a
nice
dark
brown
color
nice
carbonation
nice
onefinger
creamy
offwhite
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
peach
toffee
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
very
nice
peachy
note
with
some
toffee
thrown
in
medium
body
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
brew
quite
different
drink
ability
is
great
overall
good
seasonal
beer
another
solid
product
from
shiner
one
of
my
favorite
winter
seasonal
beers
even
though
its
not
your
typical
winter
beer
d
the
peach
is
definitely
the
focus
of
this
beer
but
it
isnt
overpowering
a
simple
beer
overall
but
certainly
tasty
one
of
shiners
better
offerings
drinkability
is
moderate
a
tasty
beer
but
the
overbearing
peach
flavor
will
definitely
limit
the
consumption
of
this
beer
drinkability
this
is
a
really
hard
one
on
drinkability
its
one
you
have
to
try
just
to
sample
those
flavors
but
it
may
not
exactly
be
your
cup
of
tea
after
drinking
the
whole
beer
im
still
not
exactly
sure
if
i
like
it
or
not
there
are
good
and
bad
aspects
to
this
beer
that
said
im
glad
i
have
a
six
pack
to
reevaluate
at
my
leisure
d
very
drinkable
more
drinkable
than
most
fruit
beers
d
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
as
long
as
its
pretty
cool
but
as
it
gets
warmer
the
peaches
come
out
all
that
much
more
until
its
almost
undrinkable
but
its
worth
trying
as
long
as
its
cool
oh
i
just
thought
i
would
add
that
i
found
out
the
abv
is
5
4
despite
that
it
isnt
awful
i
managed
to
finish
the
entire
bottle
but
im
glad
i
didnt
buy
a
sixpack
a
very
drinkable
holiday
beer
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
from
the
heavier
barleybased
beers
of
winter
i
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
a
bit
more
spice
in
the
beer
and
just
a
bit
less
carbonation
having
said
that
though
this
beer
exceeded
my
expectations
quite
a
bit

big

well
what
my
initial
sentence
stated
having
a
hard
time
wrapping
my
mind
around
peaches
and
christmas
not
working
this
however
would
be
a
great
beer
to
fall
back
on
on
a
hot
july
afternoon
something
different
than
my
normal
saisonkolschwit
habit
let
this
beer
warm
up
after
it
does
it
becomes
a
refreshingly
crisp
beer
with
a
huge
peach
flavor
and
aroma
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
very
nice
drinks
easy
this
an
americanized
dunkleweizen
i
could
drink
a
few
before
moving
on
probably
on
the
better
brews
ive
had
from
these
guys
i
found
this
to
be
a
balanced
and
interesting
brew
tweak
it
a
little
lighten
it
little
and
bingo
you
could
have
a
delightful
summer
refresher
a
tasty
treat
from
shiner
absolutely
amazing
aroma
and
great
taste
not
quite
as
good
as
shiner
black
but
this
one
is
unique
and
one
of
a
kind
nothing
like
this
one
so
check
it
out
folks
wow
i
was
very
surprised
on
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
pours
a
dark
brownruby
colour
stable
head
covers
the
top
like
a
blanket
dark
semisweet
malt
and
lots
of
peach
fresh
and
burnt
nice
very
drinkable
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
thank
god
this
beer
is
actually
really
nice
a
great
beer
for
the
weird
texas
winter
i
knocked
out
two
of
these
right
off
the
bat
very
good
beer
verdict
between
this
and
shiner
dunkelweizen
its
no
contest
holiday
cheer
just
doesnt
measure
up
but
thats
not
a
fair
way
to
rate
the
beer
viewed
objectively
this
is
a
nice
middleoftheroad
dunkelweizen
with
an
interesting
splash
of
peach
it
fits
well
into
shiners
portfolio
of
beers
stuck
in
a
bizarre
purgatory
between
macro
and
micro
im
still
not
sure
what
peach
has
to
do
with
christmas
but
im
willing
to
look
past
that
here
d
flavorful
festive
not
a
bad
beer
and
im
glad
i
got
the
6er
high
marks
for
creativity
but
i
would
like
to
see
the
peach
dialed
down
a
mark
or
three
not
shiners
best
work
but
a
very
easy
drinking
christmas
beer
overall
nasty
and
a
drain
pour
one
and
done
very
glad
i
got
a
single
instead
of
a
sixer
another
subpar
effort
from
shiner
a
faded
texas
icon
avoid
this
will
be
the
last
6er
i
buy
of
this
there
are
just
far
too
many
better
winterchristmas
beers
out
there
d
great
flavor
low
alcohol
and
smooth
drinkability
makes
this
a
very
holiday
sessionable
ale
with
that
said
its
almost
impossible
to
view
this
as
a
dunkelweizen
i
dont
see
many
traits
of
a
dunkelweizen
in
this
beer
and
imo
should
be
considered
a
fruit
beer
highly
drinkable
and
delicious
what
a
funny
thing
to
come
from
shiner
i
love
the
idea
and
the
beers
not
bad
either
its
fun
and
different
and
well
peachy
prosit
d
definitely
drinkable
good
work
spoetzl
im
always
pleased
when
the
little
brewery
in
shiner
cranks
out
a
quality
brew
great
beer
one
of
shiners
best
in
my
opinion
the
fruitiness
was
a
nice
surprise
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
d
this
is
a
great
beer
yeah
ill
be
drinking
this
all
season
long
i
appreciate
a
fruit
beer
that
isnt
cloyingly
sweet
this
isnt
a
beer
ill
seek
out
again
but
i
dont
dread
finishing
the
sixpack
in
fact
its
quite
drinkable
this
is
different
and
unique
something
i
would
recommend
definitely
one
of
spoetzls
better
offerings
overall
this
beer
suprised
me
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
although
i
could
not
drink
more
than
a
few
due
to
the
big
present
of
peaches
not
a
big
peach
fan
but
the
beer
was
tasty
what
an
odd
beer
this
holiday
cheer
not
sure
id
call
it
a
dunkelweizen
although
it
is
according
to
the
brewery
a
variation
on
their
dunkel
theme
from
a
previous
brew
still
i
cant
see
this
one
catching
on
with
the
mainstream
interesting
yes
but
probably
a
onetime
brew
glad
i
tried
it
though
if
nothing
else
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
strong
banana
aromas
and
flavors
exhibited
by
many
of
the
top
beers
in
the
style
taste
is
fine
falls
a
bit
flat
cereals
slightly
metallic
some
hops
some
citrus
kind
of
a
mishmash
o
not
a
bad
brew
the
banana
and
clove
saved
it
a
muddy
dark
brown
pour
with
a
nice
wheaty
smell
slightly
fizzy
on
the
tongue
but
with
a
very
small
head
tastes
of
wheat
banana
and
maybe
tarragon
some
kind
of
herb
at
least
leaves
a
very
mild
sweet
taste
in
your
mouth
after
swallowing
my
first
dark
wheat
would
definitely
drink
it
again
and
will
try
other
dark
wheat
beers
d
reminds
me
of
a
blend
of
brown
ale
and
hefe
a
little
bit
of
a
watery
entry
level
beer
but
i
dont
like
a
lot
of
clove
and
banana
so
i
am
fine
with
that
a
dark
iced
tea
brown
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
creamwhite
head
and
minor
traces
of
lacing
the
aroma
gives
off
sour
applelime
malt
with
an
almost
chocolaty
hint
the
flavor
is
also
tart
sourmash
with
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
herbal
hop
bitterness
its
pretty
thin
with
a
tingly
near
refreshing
feel
but
a
little
limp
for
the
style
im
not
sure
this
was
entire
on
point
even
though
it
was
supposedly
a
fresh
bottle
seemed
more
tart
than
normal
nothing
i
would
seek
out
but
it
was
okay
and
i
could
drink
a
couple
if
that
was
the
choice
as
it
is
i
didnt
finish
my
first
bottle
and
im
struggling
through
the
second
and
the
third
the
third
is
being
passed
off
on
an
unsuspecting
soul
or
poured
out
without
being
drank
shame
taste
is
pretty
well
balanced
a
bit
of
hop
a
bit
of
malt
and
yeast
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
nice
and
drinkable
i
have
already
recommended
this
to
a
few
weissdrinkers
and
would
purchase
again
if
and
when
the
mood
strikes
another
solid
effort
by
sprecher
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
to
drink
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkel
weizen
from
sprecher
it
was
quite
tasty
and
fit
the
style
nicely
d
a
good
winter
alternative
for
those
who
live
for
wheat
beer
low
abv
makes
this
a
sessionable
beer
great
to
get
a
botmc
brew
from
milwaukee
where
they
have
never
quit
making
better
or
drinking
beer
heres
to
milwaukee
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
top
yields
a
belgian
type
brew
smell
with
a
pungent
wheaty
aroma
poured
into
my
trusty
spiegelau
weizbierglas
yields
a
dark
brown
translucent
brew
with
a
creamy
microbubble
threefinger
head
head
holds
up
like
a
champ
on
first
taste
this
brew
is
very
balanced
with
a
nice
toasted
malt
sweetness
but
a
good
hoppiness
the
wheat
gives
it
incredible
body
and
mouthfeel
the
finish
of
this
brew
is
more
bitter
slightly
dry
with
a
aftertaste
that
is
actually
sweet
a
great
wheat
a
great
dunkle
and
a
very
god
brew
d
a
good
dunkelweisse
that
has
all
the
right
stuff
nothing
fancy
just
a
good
drinking
beer
solid
stuff
just
as
a
side
note
sprecher
normally
does
16oz
bottles
why
is
this
in
12oz
overall
a
less
then
stellar
beer
considering
it
comes
from
sprecher
im
not
surprised
drinkabilty
maybe
i
just
dont
prefer
this
style
of
beer
but
to
me
this
was
not
that
enjoyable
as
stated
it
had
a
very
odd
smoky
funkiness
to
it
that
i
couldnt
get
past
i
feel
like
i
will
be
sitting
on
the
other
two
of
these
that
were
sent
in
the
botm
club
oh
well
you
cant
like
everything
d
its
a
good
fall
transition
beer
when
you
cant
let
go
of
the
summer
hefes
but
want
to
start
welcoming
in
the
darker
more
substantial
beers
grab
one
of
these
dunkels
definitely
worth
picking
up
from
their
gift
store
a
nicely
done
and
easily
drinkable
beer

b
on
tap
at
rdu
dont
know
if
ive
had
this
style
before
strong
sweet
taste
some
banana
taste
body
is
a
beautiful
cloudy
amber
love
the
look
overall
not
mind
blowing
but
decent
enough
with
some
originality
as
well
had
the
dunkelweizen
at
the
g
b
in
bolingbrook
il
last
evening
the
color
was
a
nice
deep
amber
perhaps
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
laced
slightly
the
aroma
was
sweet
with
hints
of
malt
the
taste
was
a
very
good
balance
of
grain
hops
and
malt
the
was
a
slight
sweetness
that
made
the
beer
smooth
to
drink
and
the
beer
came
off
the
pallet
clean
overall
not
to
bad
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
easy
good
session
beer
poured
a
dark
copper
amber
color
with
large
foamy
beige
head
smells
of
yeast
malts
spice
and
some
kind
of
fruit
tasted
of
wheat
yeast
roasted
malts
and
a
creamy
sweetness
surprisingly
good
and
refreshing
with
a
great
aftertaste
what
a
pleasant
brew
d
this
clove
thing
is
just
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
beer
not
appealing
to
me
this
is
my
favorite
of
the
gordon
biersch
beers
it
pours
kind
of
an
ugly
muddy
brown
color
with
a
big
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
bready
and
herbal
with
spices
and
berries
the
flavor
is
strong
with
banana
clove
spice
herbal
tea
and
berries
a
bit
clunky
like
most
of
gb
beers
but
tasty
and
not
bad

drnk
was
great
very
refreshing
and
not
as
heavy
as
i
expected
very
well
crafted
brew
overall
this
is
a
great
brew
the
biggest
reason
is
that
it
doesnt
lean
toward
clove
and
banana
too
much
and
there
are
no
harsh
phenols
which
some
brewers
seem
to
not
be
able
to
tame
kudos
to
gordon
biersch
we
dig
this
beer
a
lot
d
this
one
surprised
me
i
didnt
expect
to
get
an
american
dunkelweizen
in
an
airport
that
compared
so
favorably
to
the
brews
from
munich
you
can
easily
tasted
the
malted
wheat
and
yeast
in
this
beer
the
roasted
malt
offsets
some
of
the
banana
citrus
and
clove
flavors
producing
a
sweet
rich
and
slightly
spicy
brew
that
is
both
refreshing
and
nuanced
apparently
the
beer
undergoes
five
to
six
weeks
of
aging
which
helps
strengthen
the
flavor
another
great
gb
beer
drinkability
my
first
gordon
biersch
and
a
surprisingly
pleasant
beer
first
off
good
for
them
for
taking
a
stab
at
a
style
many
dont
secondly
kudos
to
them
for
getting
it
right
this
has
all
the
characteristics
of
a
straightforward
drinkable
drunkelweiss
from
the
bananas
and
cloves
all
the
way
down
to
the
roasted
but
soft
malty
foundation
and
at
5
4
you
can
afford
to
drink
it
while
studying
for
the
virginia
bar
exam
gordon
biersch
knows
how
to
make
those
german
wheat
ales
their
hefeweizen
is
damn
good
and
their
dunkelweizen
might
even
be
better
a
hell
of
a
good
beer
did
someone
say
breakfast
in
a
bottle
this
is
one
beautiful
dunkelweizen
the
best
ive
had
outside
germany
and
a
musthave
for
any
afficiando
of
this
style
d
this
is
a
pretty
solid
dunkelweizen
that
is
definitely
worth
a
shot
oh
and
lets
go
red
wings
on
tap
at
mr
dunderbaks
in
tampa
in
a
weizen
glass
the
beer
was
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
still
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
beer
had
a
sweet
malt
aroma
with
a
little
spice
nice
sweet
malt
taste
some
citrus
and
a
little
clove
comfortable
easy
drinking
enjoyed
it
since
the
location
where
i
had
this
is
not
listed
yet
but
it
has
to
be
brewed
at
one
of
the
brewing
locations
so
ill
go
with
this
one
its
a
pretty
thick
tan
amber
with
a
modest
white
head
and
similar
lacing
the
aroma
is
clove
and
light
banana
and
some
sweet
malt
the
flavor
is
firm
clove
wheat
bread
and
subtle
citrus
its
a
well
carbonated
brew
with
a
good
feel
that
goes
down
easy
a
very
solid
refreshing
brew
drinkability
i
have
had
mixed
experiences
with
gordon
biersch
beers
but
this
one
is
a
top
notch
example
of
the
style
the
aroma
has
bananas
bubble
gum
cloves
and
wheat
the
appearance
hazy
amber
with
a
very
large
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
the
palate
is
thin
overall
a
nicely
done
dunkelweizen
i
would
gladly
drink
another
one
by
itself
or
with
food
its
worth
a
try
d
dunkelweizens
can
make
great
drinking
beers
and
this
brew
is
no
exception
perhaps
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
had
gordon
biersch
has
managed
to
retain
some
sweetness
as
well
as
highlight
the
sourness
and
phenols
present
in
hefeweizens
certainly
one
of
the
best
dunkels
out
there
for
anyone
interested
ontap
at
the
brewpub
i
wasnt
blown
away
by
the
other
gb
beers
i
tried
but
this
was
a
pretty
solid
option
it
seemed
to
take
inspiration
from
weizenbocks
with
occasional
dark
fruit
notes
otherwise
there
a
big
sweet
banana
like
when
a
banana
has
black
spots
taste
along
with
a
bit
of
cocoa
rum
and
raisins
id
order
this
again
poured
into
a
tall
pilsener
style
glass
beer
has
a
nice
3
finger
head
that
holds
pretty
weel
beer
is
dark
brownishorange
in
color
ample
carbonation
continues
to
feed
the
head
looks
delicious
strong
banana
smell
is
tempered
by
a
sweet
malty
nose
along
with
some
spices
cant
wait
to
drink
it
taste
does
not
disappoint
extremely
smooth
beer
with
hints
of
banana
clove
toffee
and
some
fruit
nothing
overpowering
in
the
taste
but
an
amazingly
well
balanced
and
complex
brew
at
the
same
time
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
and
will
continue
to
order
them
when
i
visit
the
restaurant
m
d
well
carbonated
crisp
but
with
a
little
bit
of
chewiness
at
the
same
time
this
is
my
first
gb
offering
and
it
has
made
a
very
good
first
impression
quite
a
good
beer
ive
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
gordon
biesch
brews
but
here
is
one
notable
exception
lovely
deep
tan
colored
brew
with
plenty
of
light
tan
foam
clove
and
slightly
fruity
notes
greeted
my
nose
as
i
opened
the
bottle
the
taste
was
a
fresh
mix
of
a
slightly
roasted
bready
malt
like
a
light
pumpernickle
bread
a
yeasty
clove
zip
and
a
little
fruity
slightly
banana
note
mouthfeel
a
little
tingly
but
otherwise
good
and
a
nice
smooth
enjoyable
brew
this
is
a
toasty
grain
session
beer
brewed
in
craft
form
excellent
enjoyed
ontap
at
the
miami
brewpub
a
hefeweizen
with
lots
more
chocolate
malt
nothing
wrong
with
that
an
above
average
mouthfeel
with
bananna
consistency
and
taste
a
good
dunkel
good
looking
with
lots
of
lace
milkshake
though
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
and
no
complexity
this
is
a
perfect
hot
afternoon
beer
or
as
a
warmup
for
a
drinking
session
dont
think
i
could
do
more
than
one
of
these
though
drinkability
wish
there
were
some
more
of
these
in
the
fridge
gotta
get
back
to
the
fresno
staterutgers
game
go
dogs
serving
type
bottle
drinkability
this
is
a
really
good
effort
great
traditional
approach
to
the
style
when
taking
the
1st
drink
i
knew
that
this
was
now
my
favorite
beer
i
was
eating
mexican
food
and
the
taste
combined
with
the
enchiladas
was
magnificent
the
beer
was
a
perfect
match
for
the
spicy
taste
i
finished
the
beer
in
about
4
gulps
and
wanted
another
1
right
away
all
i
can
say
is
this
a
must
beer
for
anyone
the
smoothness
that
gordon
biersch
has
perfected
will
be
a
delight
for
any
beer
drinker
go
ahead
and
give
it
a
try
poured
a
deep
brown
with
a
fair
amount
of
foam
and
loads
of
lace
the
smell
of
wheat
roasted
malts
and
yeast
filled
the
nose
the
taste
was
of
a
thick
sweetness
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
to
balance
this
smooth
tasting
dunkelweizen
one
of
the
best
u
s
dunkelweizen
that
ive
tasted
in
a
long
time
get
this
beer
if
you
can
and
you
like
the
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
especially
considering
it
cost
less
than
a
dollar
a
bottle
as
part
of
a
costco
mixed
24
pack
12oz
bottle
bottled
37
days
ago
according
to
the
date
on
the
bottle
perfect
banana
and
clove
flavors
intense
without
seeming
fake
or
overpowering
appealing
coffee
color
lots

much

that

exceptionally
good
get
it
while
it
is
fresh
maybe
the
best
beer
gb
makes
an
extremely
easy
drinker
no
real
faults
the
lack
of
smell
is
a
minimal
issue
in
my
book
the
style
hasnt
always
been
high
on
my
list
of
must
haves
but
this
beer
may
enter
my
normal
rotation
of
drinks
the
proprietary
yeast
is
not
close
to
being
what
a
weiss
should
represent
would
not
purchase
again
a
decent
take
on
the
style
perhaps
a
touch
heavy
on
the
malt
but
certainly
worth
a
try
pours
a
warm
and
inviting
clear
brown
tinged
with
golden
red
almost
mahogany
with
a
fairly
decent
light
tan
head
aroma
is
strong
yeasty
and
wheaty
with
a
hint
of
citrus
pleasing
flavor
is
mainly
wheaty
with
hints
of
fruit
mainly
pear
and
apple
plus
a
subtle
note
of
orange
and
wood
there
is
also
just
a
whisper
of
cloves
texture
has
average
body
but
plenty
of
fizz
leaving
a
persistent
tingle
and
a
fruity
wheaty
finish
ontap
at
the
brick
store
pub
pours
a
slightly
hazy
chestnut
with
a
mediocre
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
cap
in
the
nose
you
get
some
notes
of
banana
some
lemony
citrus
and
the
barest
hint
of
clove
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
the
taste
is
also
a
bit
light
but
there
are
nice
notes
of
banana
and
clove
that
grow
as
the
beer
warms
smooth
and
spicy
in
the
mouth
definitely
on
the
lighter
side
for
a
dunkelweizen
but
smooth
and
pretty
tasty
especially
ontap
overall
id
say
this
is
a
ok
brew
i
got
it
discounted
at
the
store
and
im
a
fan
of
great
divide
but
ill
stick
to
their
ipas
and
stouts
pours

muddy
brown
color

the
bottle
describes
it
visible
carbonation
the
head
disappointed
me
a
bit
most
wheat
beers
present
much
better
head
with
good
retention
this
one
had
a
decent
head
but
retention
was
poor
smell
was
of
clove
wheat
brown
sugar
and
a
little
bit
of
raisin
taste
is
great
as
far
as
american
made
dunkels
go
this
is
pretty
good
in
the
taste
department
sweet
wheat
taste
with
just
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
present
in
my
nose
as
i
sip
since
the
head
has
now
fully
receded
the
taste
is
good
but
would
not
stack
up
to
something
like
weihenstephaner
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
for
an
american
brewer
but
there
are
better
offerings
in
the
same
genre
available
to
me
that
i
would
rather
buy
d
pretty
decent
dunkel
weiss
beer
i
picked
it
up
for
1
79
which
was
a
steal
i
would
stick
to
brewers
across
the
pond
next
time
i
go
back
to
this
style
pretty
good
though
overall
flavors
seem
a
bit
watered
down
and
muted
would
not
get
this
again
at
722
oz
drinkability
great
divide
isnt
the
first
brewery
i
would
think
of
when
it
comes
to
german
style
beers
so
i
guess
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
that
this
one
is
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
the
malt
bill
lacks
the
banana
clove
and
cocoa
prominence
i
seek
in
the
style
the
beer
is
pleasant
enough
but
not
a
contender
when
compared
to
the
best
of
the
style
o
pretty
drinkable
but
is
somewhat
sour
and
dries
the
palate
as
you
get
further
along
pretty
unique
somewhere
between
a
sour
and
a
lager
i
would
say
this
is
exactly
what
gd
was
going
for
i
dont
think
id
want
this
often
but
its
definitely
worth
trying
overall
impression
doesnt
look
like
much
but
a
tasty
dunkel
for
sure
fairly
drinkable
especially
for
a
wheat
beer
id
much
rather
have
this
than
any
of
the
other
wheat
beers
sold
out
there
quite
drinkable
though
not
quite
as
strong
flavored
as
i
was
expecting
d
i
am
very
disappointed
as
i
am
a
big
fan
of
great
divide
and
dunkleweizen
i
will
try
it
again
sometime
and
update
this
post
if
necessary
as
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
they
would
actually
sell
something
this
bad
it
might
just
have
been
mistakenly
overcarbonated
tastes
tempered
malt
that
is
wet
but
counterbalanced
by
yeasty
clove
nutmeg
some
peppery
zip
from
hops
or
carbonation
and
a
mild
astringency
that
helps
dry
out
the
finish
nice
munichtype
malt
flavor
late
and
lingering
into
the
aftertaste
there
is
also
phenolic
cardboardy
character
that
i
find
rather
offputting
md
body
and
moderate
carbonation
fair
drinkability
would
be
moreso
if
i
enjoyed
the
style
this
bottle
was
a
gift
that
i
enjoyed
trying
but
wont
revisit
judged
to
style
not
my
preferences
could
use
a
light
chocolate
character
a
good
stab
at
this
style
although
ive
always
thought
great
divide
was
one
of
those
breweries
like
avery
southern
tier
or
flying
dog
that
excels
with
the
bigger
8plus
type
of
brews
overall
this
is
a
winner
thats
not
hoppy
from
a
brewery
known
for
hoppy
brews
dunkel
weiss
is
a
very
good
german
style
wheat
beer
tasty
and
very
satisfying
i
would
expect
nothing
less
from
great
divide
however
i
like
it
i
can
see
drinking
more
of
this
try
again
d
while
this
one
does
have
its
negatives
its
still
pretty
drinkable
poured
into
my
brooklynschneider
hopfenweisse
glass
a
murky
russett
color
with
a
great
fluffy
two
finger
white
head
that
settled
slowly
into
a
frothy
mass
leaving
broken
chunks
of
lace
behind
in
its
wake
aromas
of
chocolate
malt
and
clove
mainlymuch
more
chocolate
than
any
other
of
the
style
i
have
had
i
hate
to
say
it
but
the
flavors
for
me
are
average
to
below
average
for
the
style
for
memainly
chocolate
weheat
malt
flavors
with
light
cloveno
complexity
or
nuances
i
love
gdone
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
this
really
doesnt
hit
home
for
me
d
well
i
could
have
had
another
one
at
the
pub
but
i
needed
my
hop
fix
and
switched
to
a
smuttynose
ipa
so
one
was
enough
ive
found
great
divide
almost
always
does
a
style
justice
but
this
is
one
that
didnt
do
it
for
me
not
that
its
a
bad
beer
but
its
a
style
i
typically
enjoy
and
i
found
this
one
to
be
a
bit
muddled
and
well
overpriced
pours
a
light
brown
with
a
twofinger
head
that
takes
forever
to
die
and
leaves
minor
lace
around
the
glass
a
funky
roasted
malt
aroma
and
hints
of
bready
yeast
but
not
much
sweetness
nor
is
there
very
much
in
way
of
lemoncitric
zest
or
spices
lighttomedium
bodied
that
for
some
reason
has
a
smokey
edge
and
while
trying
to
combine
with
the
spices
and
citric
hops
it
doesnt
mesh
well
so
basically
a
rather
dry
malted
hefe
with
very
little
in
the
citricspice
taste
category
that
is
wellcarbd
so
it
finishes
crisp
dry
but
bland
minimal
sweet
malts
like
caramel
and
very
hard
to
notice
pepper
and
clove
in
there
as
well
a
nice
attempt
at
this
style
but
not
very
good
and
the
price
isnt
exactly
inviting
me
to
buy
another
looks
good
but
smells
a
little
weird
and
tastes
a
little
weirder
there
is
this
dominant
smelltaste
that
is
just
pungentborderline
awful
to
me
i
tried
to
be
nice
because
i
think
its
on
purpose
but
i
can
barely
get
this
down
sorry
very
sweet
has
characteristics
of
a
heffebelgian
again
there
is
something
pungent
dominating
this
beer
dphenolic
and
thin
in
the
back
lingering
and
bothering
me
not
a
solid
beer
unlike
a
true
classic
dunkel
weiss
but
not
unpleasant
as
the
rich
sweet
malt
was
quite
good
perhaps
this
should
have
been
more
accurately
labeled
as
a
hazelnut
brown
ale
good
yeast
flavors
mix
pretty
good
with
the
malt
and
wheat
bill
the
palate
brings
the
overal
quality
of
this
beer
down
a
bit
in
my
opinion
dont
let
this
beer
warm
up
too
much
this
wasnt
horrible
or
anything
but
some
more
depth
of
fruit
character
definitely
would
have
been
welcome
here
in
the
profile
as
this
mostly
came
off
as
a
bit
2note
this
was
just
ok
though
and
is
ultimately
not
one
of
great
divides
better
offerings
gd
dunkel
weiss
pours
a
pretty
standard
brown
with
some
redness
in
it
when
towards
light
a
nice
whitish
head
that
died
quickly
sparse
lace
on
this
smells
of
nuts
malt
slight
peat
chocolate
and
small
roast
taste
is
roasted
malt
up
top
blending
into
a
nutty
assortment
going
into
chocolate
a
small
earthy
hop
kick
somewhere
towards
the
beginning
nothing
to
big
feel
is
medium
and
lightly
carbed
it
goes
down
like
a
dunkel
should
so
theres
that
the
drinkability
on
this
is
not
to
much
because
it
does
nothing
for
me
maybe
im
spoiled
and
would
like
it
better
if
i
wasnt
drinking
aventinus
on
the
same
night
but
i
must
say
that
7
a
bomber
on
sale
seems
high
for
this
beer
i
expect
a
lot
more
of
a
flavor
punch
from
a
dunkel
heffeweizen
d
nicely
drinkable
despite
the
offputting
cooked
lentil
aroma
not
the
most
wellcrafted
dunkelweisse
that
ive
had
but
i
certainly
wouldnt
turndown
another
glass
pours
a
nice
reddishbrown
color
with
a
negligible
amount
of
light
brown
foam
nice
malty
aroma
along
with
bananas
cloves
and
roasted
nuts
on
the
palate
i
get
a
nice
light
brown
sugar
sweetness
along
with
wheat
clove
and
molasses
a
nice
effort
pretty
good
on
draught
but
i
have
no
intention
of
dropping
6bomber
on
this
one
at
first
taste
and
look
i
agreed
with
what
most
everyone
said
about
this
beer
pours
dark
amber
head
didnt
last
but
about
10
seconds
if
that
made
the
beer
look
like
dirty
water
fountain
water
taste
was
ok
not
too
bad
not
too
good
average
at
best
then
i
sat
down
and
ate
dinner
i
had
the
beer
with
nearly
what
they
recommended
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
had
fish
potatoes
veggies
and
wow
did
the
flavors
really
come
out
of
this
beer
i
really
enjoyed
it
while
paired
with
my
food
try
this
beer
again
with
something
close
to
what
they
recommend
on
the
bottle
you
might
be
pleasantly
surprised
i
did
not
like
this
beer
i
think
i
would
be
able
to
drink
it
easier
if
it
werent
side
by
side
with
the
quintessential
dunkel
but
still
i
dont
think
i
would
like
it
very
much
more
chocolate
cloves
and
a
bit
of
banana
come
through
in
the
taste
with
a
bit
more
rounded
feel
as
some
other
light
fruits
come
into
play
pears
and
apples
perhaps
this
one
has
some
characteristics
more
akin
to
a
dunkel
lager
than
a
dunkelweiss
strong
nutty
presence
honey
malt
sweetness
and
some
grassy
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
as
it
has
a
nice
creaminess
to
it
but
seems
to
fall
a
bit
short
of
some
of
the
best
german
dweiss
still
a
good
american
rendition
of
the
style
and
i
would
surely
buy
a
sixer
of
this
if
it
was
available
around
here
drinkability
as
i
said
its
a
bit
sweet
for
my
taste
plus
im
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkelweizen
and
this
beer
simply
cannot
satiate
that
jones
im
disappointed
that
its
not
really
what
i
expected
but
its
not
a
bad
beverage
by
any
means
the
body
is
a
bit
dry
for
style
could
use
a
bit
more
complexity
overall
carbonation
is
light
as
well
overall
some
minor
off
notes
but
could
use
some
more
depth
and
wheat
easy
drinking
though
this
is
good
and
easily
drinkable
but
not
really
all
that
memorable
sadly
this
is
my
lowest
rated
from
great
divide
other
than
hades
drinkability
is
solid
a
beer
that
they
need
to
brew
in
six
pack
form
so
i
can
grab
a
couple
more
of
these
this
coming
spring
good
stuff
overall
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
but
a
good
and
tasty
beer
and
an
admirable
attempt
at
the
style
a
bit
rich
too
be
pounding
d
still
drinkable
but
this
was
probably
much
better
fresh

will
rereview

i

on
the

no

wheat
comes
through
no
bitterness
drinkability
high
overall
a
decent
beer
the
brew
is
mediumbodied
but
seems
to
drink
a
little
heavier
and
slicker
than
that
because
of
its
copious
sweetness
and
extremely
finegrained
carbonation
great
divide
is
pretty
much
a
permanent
member
of
my
top
10
american
breweries
of
alltime
dunkel
weiss
although
a
wellcrafted
beer
in
a
general
sense
doesnt
put
a
serious
scare
into
the
greats
of
the

thanks
chuck
drinkability
well
it
certainly
isnt
everyday
that
you
run
into
a
dunkelweizen
though
im
glad
i
did
makes
for
sweet
easy
lightly
wheaty
drinking
on
this
wednesday
evening
its
nice
to
see
great
divide
churning
out
so
many
new
beers
this
year
drinkability
the
6
4
abv
is
well
masked
the
banana
and
cloves
are
well
done
i
have
officially
come
over
to
the
dunkel
side
overall
a
nice
dukel
overall
a
solid
dunkelweizen
and
another
solid
beer
from
great
divide
ive
had
better
representations
of
the
style
but
on
the
whole
a
very
good
american
interpretation
drinks
a
bit
slow
the
dryness
green
bananas
slow
me
down
not
a
bad
dunkel
but
there
many
better
d
an
enjoyable
beer
this
could
definitely
stand
up
with
some
german
competitors
overall
a
good
beer
but
nothing
special
pours
a
bloodred
deep
fluffy
head
but
not
quite
as
aggressive
as
some
of
the
german
dunkels
smell
is
a
bit
muted
but
still
fresh
vibrant
malt
doesnt
smell
hoppy
taste
is
muted
but
still
bright
sweet
dark
malt
pretty
lively
with
some
nice
carbonation
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouth
not
a
huge
depth
of
flavor
nor
as
coating
as
a
lot
of
the
germans
but
still
tasty
and
quite
refreshing
drinkability
is
low
this
is
not
a
very
good
beer
at
all
maybe
its
better
fresh
or
maybe
its
just
a
bad
beer
period
at
least
this
bottle
certainly
was
not
quite
sure
what
to
think
of
this
one
as
it
hit
me
as
a
lot
wheatier
and
breadier
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
im
enjoying
it
but
only
partially
and
probably
couldnt
stomach
the
whole
bomber
d
a
pretty
average
dunkel
weiss
decent
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
many
of
its
german
counterparts
this
is
a
lighter
beer
then
i
expected
a
little
more
body
and
flavor
would
do
this
beer
good
although
a
good
beer
it
didnt
seem
to
be
very
traditional
and
was
more
on
of
an
american
rendition
even
after
swirling
the
yeast
from
the
bottom
is
still
seemed
to
lack
some
of
the
good
traditionalness
overall
good
drinkability
pretty
basic
but
less
fruit
than
some
the
smell
was
more
complex
and
better
than
the
taste
the
flavor
starts
spicy
then
fades
to
a
roasted
maltnutty
flavor
the
flavor
was
a
little
watery
and
to
fresh
maybe
too
much
hop
presence
for
me
decent
dunkel
considering
it
is
us
made
d
well
it
is
light
in
the
feel
but
that
does
make
this
pretty
drinkable
this
becomes
an
easy
drinker
and
nice
darker
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
hotter
temperatures
it
is
solid
all
around
and
great
divide
did
a
good
job
of
representing
the
style
with
that
said
i
still
feel
the
same
way
about
this
one
as
i
do
the
rest
of
the
newer
styles
they
are
bringing
out
they
seem
to
do
just
enough
but
i
feel
like
they
could
do
a
bit
more
and
these
beers
could
be
damned
good
i
still
imagine
tweaking
will
be
done
and
this
beer
will
get
better
as
newer
batches
are
released
and
hopefully
they
will
be
thanks
again
great
divide
you
rarely
let
a
brotha
down
poured
into
a

pint
formed
a

tan
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
orangey
copper
brew
head
falls
slowly
to
halfheight
with
tons
of
sticky

is
slightly
smoky
cloves
and
wheat
sweetness
taste
is
also
wheat
sweet
upfront
moderate
clove
character
in
the
middle
through

mouthfeel
is
wow
smooth
and
drinkability
is
amazingly
good
this
one
will
get
me
back
for
more
wow
nobody
else
has
reviewed
this
one
since
i
reviewed
from
the
bottle
a
few
days
ago
well
10oz
serving
ontap
at
the
pit
served
a
crisp
dark
orange
with
a
thin
barelythere
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
no
lacing
aroma
is
a
decent
amount
of
toasted
malts
the
taste
is
a
wonderful
blend
of
toasted
malts
and
cocoa
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
and
refreshing
even
for
summer
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
but
i
must
say
i
prefer
it
bottled
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
beer
and
i
tip
my
hat
for
the
usa
as
this
is
an
excellent
interpretation
that
boldly
goes
to
a
style
of
beer
that
is
firmly
entrenched
as
a
german
specialty
and
i
feel
it
does
quite
well
nicely
done
an
enjoyable
sipper
that
improves
as
it
warms
to
near
room
temperature
md
nice
medium
to
light
body
carbonation
is
slightly
prickly
drinkability
is
fine
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
style
and
this
one
is
too
far
on
the
sweet
side
for
me
i
paid
6
for
a
22oz
bomber
which
is
awfully
expensive
for
a
dunkel
weizen
i
generally
respect
great
divide
so
i
went
ahead
and
bought
a
bottle
anyway
my
bottle
had
a
recent
bottling
date
of
april
17
2009
when
poured
it
looked
okay
the
head
was
a
bit
small
for
a
wheat
beer
but
it
wasnt
a
big
deal
the
label
claimed
a
german
yeast
was
used
and
the
aroma
seemed
to
back
that
up
i
could
smell
a
bit
of
bananaclove
character
which
i
like
unfortunately
the
taste
was
a
bit
disappointing
it
has
some
of
that
bananaclove
character
but
the
phenols
seem
to
be
slightly
out
of
whack
either
that
or
they
just
dont
mix
well
with
the
slightly
offputting
grainydark
flavor
i
like
some
quality
german
dunkel
weizen
beers
but
this
beer
has
something
in
it
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
its
almost
some
sort
of
unpleasant
dirtydirtish
flavor
whatever
it
is
it
gets
worse
as
the
beer
warms
i
was
only
able
to
get
through
half
the
bomber
before
i
had
to
dump
what
was
left
i
like
that
gd
is
doing
some
newseasonal
beers
but
ill
look
elsewhere
when
it
comes
to
dark
wheat
beers
great
tasting
if
you
like
strong
wheats
a
good
one
for
you
tastes
stronger
than
the
6
4
it
states
though
but
rich
complex
balanced
and
a
great
american
interpretation
of
the
style
pours
a
murky
mahognay
with
a
thin
tan
head
nose
is
very
fruity
with
some
wheat
malts
peppery
yeast
and
spices
taste
is
also
on
the
fruity
side
but
well
balanced
nice
citrus
and
tropical
presence
along
with
the
herbal
yeast
crisp
body
is
well
carbonated
nice
effort
from
gd
the
head
is
a
coppery
brown
color
tops
off
at
a
finger
plus
but
made
of
large
enough
bubbles
that
they
pop
off
into
a
thin
coating
across
the
surface
lacing
doesnt
stick
around
very
long
either
reddish
brown
liquid
with
a
slight
orange
lightening
at
the
rims
solid
haze
gives
it
as
much
translucency
as
you
can
get
without
opacity
very
sweet
and
thick
nose
of
clove
molasses
honey
and
caramel
with
no
lack
of
pralines
milk
chocolate
powder
apricot
cherry
fruit
with
a
touch
of
banana
and
perhaps
tangerine
fullbodied
finds
more
balance
here
with
a
hoppy
floral
mist
and
little
grassy
nip
before
the
clove
nutmeg
spice
and
molasses
butterscotch
and
caramel
take
over
the
carbonation
puts
up
a
good
struggle
against
the
density
but
eventually
falters
and
gets
squeezed
out
through
the
midpalate
smooth
enough
mouth
feel
allows
the
apricot
peach
pear
and
mango
fruit
to
slowly
spread
wide
minor
pie
crust
or
fruit
bread
notes
could
probably
have
been
made
denser
a
good
thing
it
was
not
dunkel
weiss
is
a
good
dunkelweizen
that
isnt
quite
good
enough
to
compete
with
the
worlds
finest
nonetheless
its
a
little
better
than
you
might
expect
from
a
dunkelweizen
hailing
from
colorado
having
said
that
it
could
be
better
it
would
benefit
from
more
strength
on
the
nose
and
a
stronger
banana
presence
in
smell
and
in
flavor
nonetheless
i
like
it
its
grown
on
me
more
with
each
passing
sip
a
little
warming
helps
a
lot
the
nose
and
the
flavor
seem
to
open
up
and
its
body
feels
more
substantial
i
kind
of
liked
the
first
half
of
the
bottle
and
i
really
liked
the
second
half
overall
its
good
and
i
have
no
hesitation
recommending
it
once
again
im
pleased
with
the
direction
great
divide
is
taking
keep
rolling
out
good
new
beer
guys
pours
a
murky
brown
color
with
a
solid
head
smell
is
wheaty
with
slight
bananas
in
the
nose
taste
is
cloves
banana
and
wheat
unfortunately
the
taste
was
a
little
bit
more
subdued
than
i
was
hoping
for
decent
amount
of
carbonation
overall
a
decent
brew
not
my
favorite
dunkelweizen
though
overall
a
bit
sweet
but
still
good
flavors
and
drinkable
drinkability
i
greatly
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
buy
another
very
soon
d
overall
this
is
another
fantastic
brew
from
great
divide
that
is
recommended
d
this
is
a
nice
effort
by
great
divide
i
was
quite
pleased
the
beer
went
down
easy
and
made
me
what
another
d
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
good
body
and
flavor
if
youre
not
quite
up
to
a
bock
not
as
malty
in
the
taste
as
i
thought
it
would
be
spice
clove
banana
some
bready
yeast
and
malt
maybe
its
be
but
i
think
this
style
should
be
a
slight
bit
sweeter
or
maltier
than
a
saison
not
that
this
is
a
saison
but
it
more
closely
resembles
one
to
me
its
good
thats
true
very
drinkable
although
i
dont
have
much
experience
with
the
style
i
picked
up
an
authentic
german
example
from
the
ba
top
10
and
had
it
earlier
today
i
dont
know
how
true
this
is
to
the
originals
but
its
a
tasty
beer
in
its
own
right
m
medium
bodied
mildlow
carbonation
a
little
sticky
edit
the
2010
version
of
this
beer
i
find
myself
absolutely
loving
its
still
expensive
and
only
in
bombers
but
its
more
affordable
at
the
tap
room
theres
a
distinct
flavor
that
can
almost
be
described
as
like
peanut
butter
that
i
love
d
pretty
drinkable
until
you
get
to
the
finish
where
it
almost
seemed
like
things
fell
apart
not
too
memorable
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
mildly
tart
from
the
wheat
with
higher
carbonation
d
easy
drinking
an
almost
refreshing
quality
to
it
could
use
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
flavor
22oz

dark
chestnut
not
brown
smells
quite
wheaty
and
tastes
like
cloves
wheat
yeasty
not
bad
for
a
dunkelweizen
at
all
too
bad
there
are
plenty
of
german
examples
which
are
cheaper
and
are
obviously
a
tad
bit
more
authentic
still
this
was
interesting
and
i
am
glad
to
see
great
divide
releasing
new
beers
in
bombers
poured
a
deerper
amber
color
almost
brown
with
a
smaller
sized
off
white
head
aromas
of
breadiness
wheat
toast
and
some
fruitiness
tastes
of
bananas
wheatiness
some
spices
and
lighter
roastiness
lacing
left
on
the
glass
this
is
one
of
three
new
beers
that
i
know
of
from
these
guys
the
other
two
being
saison
and
belgica
i
like
the
blurb
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
telling
the
drinker
not
to
add
any
lemon
to
this
decadent
pour
reveals
a
cloudy
dark
red
with
a
large
white
head
musty
smells
of
banana
brown
bread
and
bubblegum
come
through
in
the
aroma
overall
the
smell
is
juicy
taste
is
still
incredibly
juicy
but
with
a
beautiful
wheat
backbone
mouthfeel
is
incredibly
smooth
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
and
flavor
to
make
it
complex
yet
approachable
this
is
an
easy
drinker
but
it
deserves
to
be
sipped
a
great
beer
here
from
great
divide
that
is
as
good
if
not
better
than
many
of
the
great
german
examples
hopefully
this
is
a
year
round
offering
not
to
be
missed
for
wheat
beer
lovers
dark

in
color
and
a
bit

hues

foam
that
quickly
dissipated
sweet
dark

with
hints
of
overripe
almost
sour
dark

medium

with
lazy
carbonation
flavors
are
similar
to
aromas
roasted
and
toasted
malt
flavors
along
with
over
ripe
fruit
finished
cleanly
very
east
to
drink
but
very
forgettable
aromas
and
flavors
o
this
was
an
okay
dunkelweizen
needs
some
work
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
very
quickly
for
a
weizen
the
head
retention
is
very
disappointing
this
is
an
extremely
weak
looking
dunkelweizen
the
aroma
is
of
cloves
banana
bread
and
eraser
it
has
all
the
classic
qualities
of
a
dunkelweizen
but
they
just
dont
blend
well
together
this
is
a
very
awkward
smelling
beer
the
good
news
is
the
it
doesnt
taste
as
awkward
as
it
smells
the
bad
news
is
that
it
doesnt
taste
of
much
at
all
there
is
some
faint
toffee
and
banana
qualities
b
have
to
concentrate
hard
to
find
them
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
very
low
carbonation
which
isnt
desirable
in
a
dunkelweizen
overall
this
is
a
bad
beer
dunkelweizen
is
my
favorite
beer
style
and
the
brewer
has
to
work
hard
to
mess
one
up
enough
for
me
not
to
like
it
this
was
brewed
by
a
hard
working
brewer
drinkability
is
good
nothing
too
detracting
in
any
of
the
aspects
of
this
beer
decent
for
a
cool
spring
night
d
good
session
beer
taste
was
cider
some
citrus
and
fruit
kind
of
a
strange
one
d
im
torn
over
this
one
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
were
way
off
but
the
aroma
and
flavor
were
great
crank
up
the
fizz
and
get
in
some
head
retention
and
youd
have
a
nice
beer
unfortunately
this
beer
is
only
half
right
in
summary
this
was
a
boring
beer
to
me
seems
like
the
brewer
just
phoned
this
one
in
not
something
i
can
really
recommend
44444
d
pretty
good
there
are
much
better
dark
wheat
beers
out
there
though
ive
never
really
been
impressed
with
aktienbraurei
the
oktoberfest
sucks
and
thats
a
hard
one
to
screw
up
this
is
just
mediocre
i
like
the
vanilla
wafer
and
banana
pudding
notes
so
im
having
a
hard
time
hating
this
beer
the
aroma
is
heavy
with
brown
sugar
and
caramel
there
is
also
some
dark
fruit
raisins
yeast
and
bread
the
appearance
is
amber
brown
with
yeast
chunks
and
a
small
head
the
flavor
is
like
the
aroma
and
somewhat
bitter
and
acidic
the
palate
is
thin
and
poorly
carbonated
i
like
the
beer
but
it
just
seems
subpar
in
to
many
areas
to
be
a
great

still

i

this

very

tasty
if
you
give
it
a
chance
d
fairly
good
likely
to
due
the
carbonation
its
different
dability
not
an
unpleasant
drinking
beer
but
i
could
probably
name
a
dozen
german
wheat
beers
that
are
better
without
much
effort
poured
from
a
1pt
0
9oz
bottle
this
beer
was
lighter
in
color
than
expected
this
was
too
light
to
be
considered
a
dunkelweizen
and
in
fact
resembled
its
brother
st
blasius
weizenbock
apparently
helles
version
the
aroma
is
a
little
buttery
maybe
a
hint
of
lactose
sourness
not
too
much
of
the
clovebanana
i
expected
and
wanted
same
with
the
taste
this
leaves
an
impression
of
slightly
sour
milk
maybe
the
bottle
is
aged
improperly
in
which
case
this
review
is
unfair
but
really
it
shouldnt
be
sold
to
the
public
me
if
this
is
not
the
intended

i
drank
it

in
this
reviewers

definitely
drinkable
but
you
have
to
like
sour
bacteria
flavored
beers
in
sum
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
but
one
im
hard
pressed
to
characterize
as
a
dunkelweizen
and
one
that
would
seem
to
be
terrific
had
it
more
hops
and
more
prominent
taste
for
future
samplers
dont
expect
a
familiar
weizen
this
one
is
on
the
whole
decent
but
strange
when
the
beer
was
poured
from
the
pint
bottle
to
my
pint
glass
it
had
a
dark
goldamber
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
was
very
complex
i
picked
up
an
apple
aroma
with
a
spicy
undertone
there
was
a
sweet
malt
presence
as
well
and
an
alcohol
lace
the
flavor
was
a
tad
sour
probably
a
product
of
the
yeast
the
beer
finished
well
it
initially
is
dry
but
the
hops
peek
through
and
the
darker
gains
linger
for
a
toffee
flavor
to
boot
the
mouthfeel
was
a
medium
body
wellcarbonated
effect
all
together
the
beer
was
a
good
experience
aroma
is
fruity
sweet
with
lots
of
malt
and
some
mild
bannna
and
nut
notes
copper
orange
in
color
with
an
amazingly
fast
receding
head
starts
with
two
fingers
of
tan
head
and
goes
to
none
in
seconds
nutty
roasted
notes
in
the
fore
with
a
bit
of
sweet
fruitcake
and
smooth
sweet
malt
low
carbonation
levels
and
virtually
no
hop
bitterness
drinkability
is
decent
but
2

is
just
too
much
to
pay
for
a
beer
of
this
rather
modest
quality
certainly
doesnt
measure
up
to
this
brewerys
fin
doppelbock
weizens
arent
usually
my
thing
but
i
be
this
pretty
good
over
in

weak
for
a
dunkel
weizen
aktien
brauerei
is
usually
far
better
than
this
but
ive
been
dissapointed
with
their
brews
lately
definitely
not
what
i
expected
although
by
the
label
its
hard
to
tell
if
this
one
is
past
its
prime
or
not
i
would
hazard
to
guess
its
infected
if
its
indeed
supposed
to
be
a
dunkelweizen
chalk
this
one
up
as
an
interesting
experiment
i
wont
rate
this
one
to
style
which
gives
it
much
higher
marks
that
it
deserves
as
its
an
absolutely
horrible
dunkel
saw
this
today
in
a
local
health
food
store
after
beginning
my
night
with
a
schneiderweisse
i
unfortnunately
followed
with
this
head
immediately
disappated
not
a
good
sign
for
a
wheat
beer
taste
was
initially
quite
thin
as
was
the
mouthfeel
very
carbonated
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
is
also
not
good
i
agree
with
another
reviewer
who
classified
this
one
as
a
soda
beer
no
reason
to
try
it
boys
im
so
glad
i
have
an
aventinus
to
bring
me
back
to
my
standards
man
after
admiring
this
dunkelweizens
appearance
i
had
high
hopes
for
this
brew
alas
like
so
many
things
looks
can
be
deceiving
it
had
all
the
characteristics
of
a
flat
cocacola
on
ice
if
you
want
a
fairly
pretty
beer
with
little
else
going
for
it
pick
up
a
steingadener
dunkelweisse
if
youre
looking
for
a
flavorful
dunkelweizen
look
past
it
i
suppose
this
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
theres
really
nothing
here
that
would
make
me
want
to
have
another
this
is
a
delicious
beer
that
is
pretty
drinkable
and
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
more
overall
the
closest
think
i
have
ever
drunk
to
a
beer
soda
which
in
england
we
would
call
a
shandy
it
is
not
on
my
restocking
list
nice
though
probably
my
favorite
beer
exceptionally
good
for
a
beer
with
10
alcohol
deceptive
but
tasty
doesnt
have
a
tripel
profile
that
im
used
to
dark
and
chocolate
notes
alcohol
content
is
well
hidden
surprised
this
is
a
mckinney
local
would
drink
again
a
very
tasty
very
strong
lager
black
in
color
and
about
10
alcohol
dangerous
very
drinkable
with
medium
mouth
feel
alcohol
is
well
hidden
dark
and
smooth
very
nice
franconia
not
complex
and
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
as
it
all
but
vanishes
by
the
time
im
23rds
of
the
way
through
my
pint
the
alcohol
is
more
hidden
than
i
expected
the
beer
screams
dark
and
german
and
its
balanced
in
flavor
i
like
what
i
like
about
it
this
is
a
favorite
of
mine
while
not
inexpensive
i
think
its
a
great
value
and
a
bit
meatier
more
interesting
than
a
straightup
hefeweisse
its
dunkel
for
a
wheat
but
a
beautiful
amber
in
the
glass
i
recommend
it
regularly

nice
and
creamy
ill
be
back
for
this
summer
in
glass
great
dunkel
for
a
great
price
perfect
for
a
warm
afternoon
pours
a
cloudy
murky
reddish
brown
with
a
tightly
bubbled
off
white
head
that
shows
moderate
retention
aromas
of
banana
and
clove
with
hints
of
spice
light
fruit
and
earth
the
flavor
is
fruity
and
spicy
with
clove
and
banana
dominating
light
yeasty
earthy
flavors
come
in
as
well
medium
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
a
bubbly
sweet
mouthfeel
nice
dark
hefe
a
bit
bubbly
for
my
tastes
but
they
usually
are
atmosphere
is
pretty
good
really
nice
head
no
real
lacing
nose
is
sweet
and
bitter
bready
with
a
bitter
and
sweet
component
overall
this
is
a
good
quaff
o
my
first
julius
echter
beer
and
definitely
not
my
last
this
far
exceeded
my
expectations
it
was
sweet
creamy
balanced
and
refreshing
tons
of
banana
flavors
present
in
the
caramel
colored
liquid
a
velvety
mouthfeel
helps
this
beer
go
down
smooth
and
often
a
great
grilling
companion
on
a
perfect
summer
night
a
topnotch
dunkelweizen
no
doubt
highly
recommended
now
to
continue
enjoying
this
alongside
my
fig
and
prosciutto
flatbread
o
pretty
decent
as
far
as
the
style
goes
but
it
didnt
wow
me
it
felt
a
little
flat
but
it
in
all
fairness
it
did
have
a
pretty
rough
journey
in
the
trunk
of
my
car
for
a
couple
of
days
o
i
wish
i
had
drank
this
when
it
was
fresh
but
im
not
complaining
still
a
nice

oz

not

in
any

area
but
a
characterful
brew
thats
worth
a
try
apple
becomes
overwhelming
as
it
warms
overall
a
good
dunkelweizen
ive
had
a
lot
of
dunkels
that
are
overdone
with
toohigh
alcohol
and
too
much
phenolic
messiness
in
contrast
this
is
a
clean
quaffable
brew
id
definitely
have
this
again
poured
from
a
bottle
and
served
in
a
weisse
vase
the
beer
is
a
bright

with
a
thin
filmy
white
surface
coating
of
head
aromas
of
banana
bread
biscuit
and
tangy
fruit
sweetness
flavors
are
rich
and
round
initially
with
a
banana
and
clove
forward
flavor
that
ends
up
sharp
and
frothy
due
to
a
light
body
and
increased
carbonation
the
aftertaste
is
fruity
as
well
with
some
subtle
citrus
highlights
and
a
grainy
undertone
sharp
effervescent
finish
that
cleans
the
palate
but
is
a
tad
bit
rough
overall
o
not
perfect
but
pretty
darn
good
everything
a
dunkelweizen
should
be
seriously
drinkable
alone
or
with
a
lightlyspiced
meal
ill
not
hesitate
to
get
another
at
the
next

this

has
a
good

with
a
crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
still
tasty
a
good
6
months
after

nothing
earthshattering
this
beer
does
what
it
should
poured
from

hefe
glass
looks
amazing
light
brown
colored
body
with
a
huge
creamy
head
that
looked
like
creme
brulee
smell
was
disappointing
no
real
hefe
aromas
present
as
with
other
german
brands
taste
was
good
nice
balance
of
dark
malt
with
the
wheat
mouthfeel
was
thin
so
i
would
have
liked
it
to
be
a
bit
thicker
its
a
fine
beer
to
look
at
but
the
taste
overall
was
just
decent
but
nothing
special
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
malt
body
but
its
still
a
good
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
the
carbonation
is
almost
on
par
with
most
popular
soft
drinks
but
even
with
that
in
mind
its
a
pleasant
easilyquaffed
brew
overall
a
nice
crisp
and
clean
brew
very
easy
to
drink
maybe
just
a
little
too
mellow
cheers
odfor
2
75
for
a
500
ml
this
is
a
decent
deal
i
dont
love
this
beer
but
i
appreciate
the
value
it
isnt
bad
at
all
but
its
no
more
than
a
mellow
brew
its
pretty
good
just
muted
all
over
again
yeast
primarily
tart
and
yeasty
cant
avoid
it
overall
its
a
decent
session
beer
because
its
drinkable
it
looks
and
smells
great
but
i
wont
bother
putting
it
in
my
fridge
again
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
best
before
201202
this
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
massive
white
head
the
smells
are
of
sweet
yeast
esters
banana
and
spices
feel
is
medium
to
light
with
high
carbonation
taste
is
a
little
lighter
than
expected
wheat
banana
spices
not
bad
though
pours
a
caramel
brown
color
aromas
of
bavarian
yeast
noble
flowery
hop
and
straw
in
the
taste
smooth
clove
and
muted
fruit
notes
caramel
sugar
and
faint
banana
bread
there
is
little
bitterness
crisp
somewhat
smooth
finish
overall
a
nice
dark
wheat
beer
and
goes
down
easy
overall
i
enjoyed
this
dunkelweiss
and
look
forward
to
trying
many
others
this
upcoming
winter
overall
excellent
smooth
beer
my
personal
feeling
is
that
this
is
a
professional
and
classic
beer
only
if
i
could
find
this
in
a
six
pack
for
a
friday
night
o
not
bad
a
2
99
a
pint
bottle
i
remember
this
being
4
99
at
this
price
you
cant
beat
it
a
good
wheat
beer
for
sure
drinkability
good
stuff
but
i
think
it
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
overall
nice
but
probably
not
a
repeat
buy
o
not
very
impressed
with
this
one
and
probably
wont
be
going
back
unfortunately
the
smell
and
taste
were
a
bit
boring
and
didnt
make
for
an
enjoyable
experience
o
this
beer
is
a
real
soft
easydrinker
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
to
make
this
amazing
but
the
dunkel
aspect
makes
this
more
interesting
than
a
standard
hefe
this
was
priced
very
well
at
3
for
the
500ml
so
im
glad
i
picked
this
up
nice
value
for
the
taste
i
can
only
say
one
thing
flat
all
the
way
no
beer
to
drink
a
second
time
this
beer
poured
out
as
a
hazy
dark
brown
color
what
had
some
orange
highlights
around
the
egdes
the
head
was
fluffy
and
tan
typical
of
the
style
the
aromas
were
of
banana
some
clove
some
raisin
and
a
hint
of
yeasty
wheat
the
taste
was
decent
there
was
the
typical
wheat
beer
flavors
along
with
some
toasted
flavors
as
well
there
may
be
some
fruits
in
there
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
much
like
other
beers
like
this
overall
it
wasnt
too
bad
but
i
think
there
are
better
ones
out
there
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
for
a
sessionable
4
9
weight
im
impressed
theres
a
big
cinnamon
raisin
aroma
with
light
candied
bread
behind
it
the
body
and
flavor
are
a
touch
on
the
thin
side
understandable
for
the
lighter
alcohol
the
flavor
has
more
a
of
date
and
plum
taste
similar
to
a
dark
belgian
ale
with
hints
of
the
wheat
malt
and
a
slight
spicy
rye
bread
taste
though
im
sure
no
rye
was
used
im
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
im
digging
this
beer
sure
it
drinks
more
like
a
dark
belgian
ale
but
its
damned
tasty
ill
take
another
notes
overall
its
a
good
solid
dunkelweizen
with
all
the
good
classic
german
flavors
overall
not
impressed
dont
hate
it
but
wont
spend
another
penny
on
another
bottle
would
drink
for
free
3
59
at
total
wine
500ml
bottle
o
an
outstanding
drinker
i
prefer
this
to
the
julius
echter
hefe
a
solid
example
of
a
good
dunkelweizen
after
other
dunkels
i
think
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
in
the
smell
and
taste
i
am
not
disappointed
but
this
is
just
more
like
a
wheat
beer
than
i
expected
i
marked
down
on
smell
because
it
seemed
rather
lacking
again
not
a
bad
thing
500ml
into
a
snifter
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
black
in
incandescent
lights
with
a
massive
head
that
doesnt
want
to
go
anywhere
just
sit
there
on
top
of
the
brew
like
a
fat
top
of
goodness
nice
and
cloudy
too
gorgeous
man
the
germans
brew
great
beer
i
realize
this
isnt
a
favorite
style
of
many
people
but
i
love
it
in
the
spring
and
its
delicious
the
nose
is
big
and
reeks
of
excellent
lager
funk
that
gives
it
kind
of
a
banana
like
nose
with
the
alcohol
the
taste
doesnt
disappoint
either
its
got
a
great
sharpness
from
the
wheat
with
a
substantial
and
complex
malt
profile
hops
balance
it
just
right
but
dont
get
in
your
face
perfect
after
the
big
ipa
i
just
drank
great
contrast
mouthfeel
is
like
a
semisweet
loaf
of
rich
bread
tons
of
texture
leaves
lace
all
the
way
on
the
glass
as
the
head
subsides
a
little
and
i
drink
some
more
very
drinkable
at
this
abv
wonderful
beer
a
classic
of
the
style
highly
recommended
very
dry
off
putting
and
dull
certainly
a
beer
you
could
have
a
few
of
but
at
3
bucks
a
bottle
why
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
not
the
best
but
a
good
solid
pick
for
a
dunkel
heffe
i
will
definitely
pick
this
up
if
i
see
it
again
drinks
well
but
one
was
fine
with
me
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
nothing
extraordinary
very
drinkable
i
could
happily
swill
pitchers
of
this
in
the
summertime
easy
to
drink
once
you
fight
thru
the
head
solid
drinkability
right
to
the
last
drop
d
different
than
how
i
remember
this
beer
had
a
nut
brown
before
tasting
this
but
a
favorite
of
mine
when
going
out
for
german
d
high
but
not
what
i
wanted
from
this
beer
a
solid
dunkelweizen
that
doesnt
do
anything
wrong
but
doesnt
have
that
any
one
distinctive
flair
that
sets
it
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
dunkelweizens
a
brown
thats
more
murky
than
just
regular
weizen
cloudiness
with
a
fine
creamcolored
head
the
aroma
is
notable
for
the
baked
bread
aroma
and
more
clove
than
fruit
flavor
faithfully
follows
the
aroma
with
hops
finally
putting
in
an
appearance
to
keep
it
balanced
a
little
less
carbonated
than
id
expect
for
a
weizen
but
the
hops
still
keep
it
balanced
overall
a
nice
beer
that
reminds
me
of
south
german
bierkellers
drinkability
is
good
goes
down
smoothly
pretty
refreshing
d
eh
i
picked
up
a
few
imports
today
on
the
recommendation
from
a
friend
who
lived
in
germany
and
grew
to
love
german
beers
i
was
much
more
impressed
with
the
kolsch
than
this
drinkability
not
in
the
top
echelon
of
the
style
but
a
decent
beer
would
like
to
see
more
banana
and
less
clove
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
rather
thirst
quenching
a
enjoyably
savor
dunkelweizen
that
has
a
dry
qualities
to
it
but
quite
a
mild
palate
nose
is
floral
wheat
and
apple
pie
a
touch
of
buckwheat
palate
is
subtle
and
wheat
malt
predominant
not
sweet
at
all
for
a
dunkelhef
taste
of
cameralized
apple
with
dry
and
mineral
earth
with
sugar
extracted
when
its
too
old
this
seems
to
drain
out
all
the
other
favors
with
a
predominant
sour
finish
when
fresh
there
is
sufficient
hopping
to
clear
the
palate
and
provide
for
the
delicate
roasted
flavor
apple
clove
and
very
mild
grassy
lemon
bitter
mind
you
quite
subdued
citrus
great
beer
on
the
delicate
side
i
could
see
myself
drinking
this
outside
in
the
early
evening
on
a
lazy
summer
day
while
i
wouldnt
mind
having
it
again
i
dont
think
ill
be
revisiting
it
anytime
soon
it
was
good
but
didnt
make
me
want
to
keep
going
back
i
was
expecting
something
more
mild
clove
and
wheat
aromas
greet
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
brown
sugar
and
baking
bread
just
a
hint
of
banana
which
becomes
much
more
apparent
in
the
taste
the
wheat
is
much
more
assertive
as
well
a
nice
lemony
bite
fresh
bread
and
toasted
malts
are
on
display
from
midswallow
on
nice
hearty
mouthfeel
it
seems
to
fluff
up
throughout
the
sip
a
pretty
tasty
dunkel
thats
worth
a
try
drinkability
is
very
good
very
tasty
beer
moutheel
is
spritzy
medium
bodied
caramel
laden
toffee
heath
bar
flavors
lingering
d
very
refreshing
a
bit
more
flavor
profile
than
the
je
hefeweissbier
stands
up
on
its
own
or
would
go
well
with
a
cheeseburger
on
the
grill
from
the
500
ml
bottle
with
a
date
of
2010060824
sampled
on
march
27
2010
the
pour
is
a
dark
amber
color
but
slightly
cloudy
the
head
is
thick
and
puffy
the
aroma
tends
to
be
malted
but
there
us
also
an
aroma
of
charcoal
toast
and
perhaps
molasses
it
is
not
unappealing
the
mouthfeel
comes
in
at
about
mediumto
heavy
the
taste
has
toasted
bread
or
biscuit
notes
grains
and
a
stale
sort
of
maltiness
even
though
use
the
word
stale
that
does
not
describe
it
it
is
better
than
that
i
just
wouldnt
put
it
up
high
on
my
list
of
go
to
beers
from
a
500ml
bottle
this
beer
pours
to
a
nice
dark
amber
color
with
a
little
head
the
aroma
is
very
light
almost
not
there
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
medium
thickness
there
is
only
a
light
wheat
flavor
which
i
was
expecting
it
to
be
a
bit
more
robust
not
very
exciting
more
impressive
on
the
tongue
than
in
the
nose
with
a
light
grassy
bitterness
that
balances
well
with
toasted
caramel
and
wheat
malts
yeasty
esters
add
spice
and
a
hint
of
tropical
fruit
mouthfeel
is
full
and
creamy
with
a
big
weizeny
carbonation
level
smooth
with
a
tinge
of
bitterness
on
the
finish
i
wish
this
beer
was
as
impressive
as
its
appearance
but
its
still
quite
the
tasty
dunkelweizen
give
it
a
try
carbonation
is
gentle
and
this
is
lighter
and
cleaner
on
the
finish
than
i
was
hoping
for
quite
quaffable
though
which
i
suppose
is
the
purpose
maybe
a
better
summer
beer
as
is
the
cliche
with
hefs
pretty
good
overall
not
supermemorable
but
they
cant
all
be
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
deals
on
this
one
and
give
her
another
run
when
the
sun
comes
out
give
it
a
try
very
nice
for
the
money
drinkability
if
youre
into
these
kinds
of
beers
youll
like
this
one
it
is
not
my
style
but
i
acknowledge
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
style
md
one
of
the
best
dunkelweizens
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
perfect
carbonation
stays
prickly
on
the
tongue
all
the
way
to
the
end
the
sweetness
might
be
a
bit
too
cloying
still
a
great
beer
for
a
low
price

kind

medium

grainy

its
certainly
not
bad
but
the
flavour
really
didnt
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
aroma
and
didnt
quite
hit
what
i
expect
in
a
dunkelweizen
pours
a
orangish

with
a
thin

has
fruity
malts
wheat
and
herbs
taste
also
quite
sweet
with
crisp
fruits
and
herbs
light
to
medium
body
is
well
carbonated
not
the
most
complex
dunkelwiezen
around
but
a
nice
refreshing
session
beer
all
night
all
day
drinkable
with
a
clean
neutral
finish
a
solid
dunkel
and
drinkable
all
the
same
that
would
go
great
with
any
food
and
sessioning
of
other
beery
sorts
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
tasty
as
well
d
this
a
decent
dunkel
just
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
come
back
for
more
drinkability
is
good
this
style
isnt
my
favorite
but
id
drink
it
again
smells
of
banana
clove
and
some
wheat
sweet
taste
refreshing
and
light
additional
hints
of
caramel
and
possibly
bubble
gum
in
the
flavor
medium
body
lighter
then
i
expected
though
smooth
creamy
feel
decent
brew
but
i
dont
want
it
again
the
taste
is
very
nice
it
is
a
tad
on
the
sweeter
side
but
it
is
a
very
characteristic
dark
wheat
ale
the
green
apples
some
clove
some
caramel
some
brown
sugar
the
prickly
mouthfeel
the
slight
tartness
and
the
wheaty
smooth
feel
define
the
beer
the
beer
is
a
bit
watery
as
is
characteristic
of
the
style
but
it
has
more
body
and
mid
section
than
most
wheat
beers
the
taste
is
refreshing
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
with
no
real
aftertaste
or
off
mouthfeel
this
is
a
really
good
representation
of
the
style
and
one
worth
going
back
to
as
a
standard
bearer
lchaim
d
this
is
a
great
goto
brew
sessionable
with
a
lot
of
flavor
this
medium
body
wheaty
tasting
beer
is
solid
even
if
it
didnt
have
quite
the
spice
that
maybe
i
was
expecting
i
will
definitely
give
it
another
try
at
another
point
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
on
this
medium
bodied
brew
still
smooth
enough
to
easily
drink
with
a
nice
moderate
carbonation
not
a
bad
beer
and
one
i
would
try
again
an
explosively
carbonated
pour
results
in
a
huge
tan
head
retention
is
excellent
and
a
splotchy
chunky
lacing
is
left
behind
color
is
light
brown
like
a
glass
of
tea
some
spice
faint
light
fruits
and
some
metallic
notes
rise
to
the
nose
tastes
of
wheat
malts
and
more
light
fruits
really
not
much
going
on
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
expected
creaminess
is
not
present
in
fact
it
borders
on
dry
going
down
theres
too
many
exceptional
dark
hefes
out
there
to
spend
too
much
time
on
this
one
d
i
have
tried
over
10
dunkelweizens
and
this
one
reigns
supreme
it
is
exactly
what
i
look
for
in
a
dunkel
and
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
long
live
the
je
dunkel
d
very
very
good
easy
drinking
and
low
in
alcohol
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
wet
but
firm
overall
flavor
was
a
little
weaker
than
i
was
expecting
but
good
nonetheless
some
warm
bready
flavor
with
hints
of
brown
sugar
slight
fruitiness
and
finishes
sweet
drinkability
is
high
on
this
beer
there
is
nothing
harsh
here
at
all
just
a
welldone
dunkel
that
is
mild
and
tame
recommend
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
but
im
not
sure
its
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
ever
had
pleasant
sipping
and
high
drinkability
but
not
something
i
plan
to
return
to
much
in
the
future
still
at
below
5
abv
its
a
totally
sessionable
beer
if
you
want
it
to
be
slight
bitter
and
a
hint
of
metallic
with
a
fantastically
clean
finish
like
a
lager
carbonation
is
just
right
and
it
is
not
overly
sweet
a
great
beer
for
any
day
and
would
be
great
with
smoked
food
or
bbq
d
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
have
had
better
but
it
would
do
nicely
worth
trying
sometime
very
nice
looking
brew
here
with
a
cloudy
brown
color
and
a
thick
light
tan
head
which
has
pretty
good
retention
no
real
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
inviting
with
wheat
banana
clove
coming
through
the
flavors
are
real
good
here
malts
give
a
nice
roasty
flavor
that
seems
to
give
it
a
slight
caramel
and
nut
like
flavor
also
a
nice
banana
flavor
here
reminds
me
a
bit
of
bread
seems
to
be
a
little
spicy
on
the
tongue
which
is
nice
overall
this
is
a
solid
brew
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
here
but
well
done
and
very
drinkable

oktoberfest
celebrations
were
happening
up
in
lincoln
nh
during
columbus
day
weekend
i
had
this
from
its
bottle
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
had
a
typical
dunkelweizen
look
dark
brownblack
look
with
a
medium
frothy
head
malty
roasted
flavors
permeated
from
the
drink
really
potent
of
almost
dried
fruits
and
slight
coffee
hint
taste
was
wonderfully
sweet
and
milky
not
too
heavy
though
the
drink
had
a
good
light
cream
aspect
to
it
overall
a
great
dunkel
good
first
timer
but
weaker
than
others
i
have
tried
d
very
smooth
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
i
dont
drink
many
german
beers
and
this
one
has
me
wondering
why
not
d
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
the
relative
dryness
actually
helps
this
brew
approach
session
status
with
the
love
abv
something
id
love
to
have
again
it
has
a
lot
of
great
characteristics
the
smell
brings
me
in
the
taste
brings
me
back
but
after
a
few
mouthfuls
i
find
myself
filling
up
on
it
i
definately
find
it
drinkable
but
it
is
too
filling
to
be
a
session
beer
the
beer
poured
a
murkey
brownish
red
color
with
a
slightly
offwhite
but
huge
head
that
was
well
retained
the
aroma
was
light
and
a
little
malty
the
taste
was
good
followed
the
aroma
malty
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
the
beer
had
the
right
carbonation
for
a
dunkel
and
it
was
a
medium
body
that
was
very
smooth
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
good
session
beer
a
cloudy
looking
beer
that
pours
a
huge
head
only
head
ive
seen
bigger
is
that
of
a
boddingtons
this
has
a
strong
citrus
almost
melon
taste
to
it
definitely
something
different
from
what
im
used
to
they
served
it
with
a
lemon
but
theres
no
need
for
that
i
discarded
that
quickly
it
was
very
expensive
so
i
might
not
get
it
again
but
overall
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
and
definitely
refreshing
good
brew
all
around
i
could
drink
these
no
problem
would
i
buy
these
again
yes
subpar
in
my
opinion
the
burnt
wood
character
detracts
something
i
will
pass
by
next
time
i
see
it
i
had
this
gem
at
h
j
heleys
in
st
augustine
i
love
a
good
dunkel
and
i
couldnt
pass
it
up
on
tap
served
chilled
the
official
pilsner
style
julius
echter
glassware
had
a
wonderful
rich
rust
color
with
a
decent
white
head
smell
was
of
bready
yeasty
sweet
chocolate
goodness
first
sip
yeilded
a
wheat
burst
with
a
velvety
smoothness
then
the
banana
esters
kicked
in
with
some
candied
sugar
and
a
touch
of
chocolate
on
a
crisp
finish
good
to
the
last
drop
and
a
real
treat
cloudy
orange
in
color
with
a
full
dense
foam
that
morphs
into
plateaus
very
nice
aromatics
with
clove
banana
and
spice
notes
flavor
doesnt
have
the
fullness
of
flavor
that
would
make
it
outstanding
but
it
has
nice
flavors
of
vanilla
and
ripe
fruit
could
have
more
depth
and
more
weizen
characteristics
its
just
okay
dability
hefe
yeast
character
quite
subdued
dark
malt
balances
perfectly
maybe
the
perfect
wheat
beer
for
wheat
beer
haters
drinkability
is
good
its
non
offensive
just
not
very
exciting
at
all
might
buy
again
but
only
after
trying
some
other
dunkelweiss
first
drinkability
good
easy
drinking
dunkel
cloudy
orangered
with
a
frothy
white

that

great
wheat
aroma
with
a
little
malt
taste
is
a
clean
light
drinking
blend
of
wheat
banana
and
subtle
malt
mouthfeel
is
again
clean
and
crisp
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
with
no
strong
alcohol
aftertaste
not
surprising
at
4
9
a
great
choice
for
a
summer
lunch
or
an
evening
barbeque
good
drinkability
aside
from
a
little
something
off
in
the
aroma
its
quenching
as
these
german
wheat
beer
tend
to
be
overall
another
echter
beer
with
subdued
flavors
but
another
echter
beer
that
still
has
a
pleasent
flavor
easy
to
drink
and
is
refreshing
definitely
worth
the
2
i
paid
overall
a
pretty
tasty
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
id
buy
it
again
in
a
heartbeat
if
its
on
sale
this
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
only
some
head
it
had
that
typical
wheat
beer
scent
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
wheat
with
tones
of
malt
it
tasted
like
caramelized
malt
and
a
bit
of
hops
bitterness
it
had
the
typical
wheat
beer
aftertaste
along
with
the
scent
the
texture
was
pretty
thick
with
a
little
bit
of
carbonation
but
generally
fairly
smooth
still
not
my
style
but
overall
it
was
better
than
most
wheat
beers
ive
had
worth
a
shot
but
certainly
not
the
best
representation
of
the
style
a
very
solid
dunkelweiss
i
would
have
preferred
a
little
more
dark
roasted
malt
character
as
well
as
more
banana
and
clove
flavors
but
then
this
would
not
have
been
such
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
in
session
d
quite
nice
drinks
could
be
another
potential
session
drink
it
seems
like
it
might
be
a
little
burpy
but
its
a
nice
and
light
well
flavoured
brew
i
might
personally
prefer
their
other
hefe
but
i
am
growing
fond
of
this
brewery
d
a
little
low
abv
wise
for
a
dunkel
4
9
but
overall
drinks
very
nicely
and
is
well
crafted
and
clean
nice
in
the
mouth
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
bit
of
pepperyness
to
go
with
that
dunkelweizen
oilyness
not
bad
a
drinkable
ale
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
its
decently
drinkable
but
i
can
think
of
others
id
head
for
first
i
still
think
this
bier
is
way
overpriced
at
1014
bucks
a
16
9
oz
four
pack
but
when
im
in
the
mood
i
want
it
md
light
to
medium
bodied
carbonation
is
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
and
drinkability
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
if
its
any
help
my
cousin
in

prefers

a
hazed
amber

with

with

is
meaty
almost
like
biting
into
the
flank
of
something
a

thats
it
its
like
biting
into
an
old
aged
hearty
tree
there
is
a
strong
earthen
tone
to
the
flavor
profile
feel
is
decent
though
it
seems
to
me
almost
a
bit
watery
carbonation
is
nice
but
like
i
said
a
bit
thin
drinkable
yes
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
the
style
quite
yet
but
this
is
a
pretty
interesting
brew
might
take
someone
with
a
bit
of
a
developed
palate
to
appreciate
it
though
poured
from
its
pint
bottle
into
my
glass
it
has
a
earthybrown
color
with
typical
wheat
cloudiness
the
head
is
comprised
of
white
little
bubbles
which
dissapated
quickly
leaving
moderate
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
made
up
of
carmelized
barley
and
fruit
esters
with
little
or
no
hop
presence
the
flavor
is
initally
sour
but
quickly
blends
for
a
balanced
medium
bodied
finish
there
are
traces
of
clover
and
toasted
barley
in
the
flavor
but
not
the
yeast
ester
i
typically
look
for
in
bavarian
dunkels
that
being
said
i
thought
it
was
an
all
around
decent
wheat
but
not
a
standout
for
its
style

pretty
good

could
go
for
this

malts
along
with
the
german
hefe
yeast
but
there
is
a
sweet
crystal
malt
element
as
well
its
not
overly
sweet
but
just
enough
to
let
you
know
its
there
the
taste
is
average
it
tastes
like
muddy
water
there
is
a
weak
crystal
malt
flavor
laid
over
a
pale
weiss
taste
its
got
a
light
sweetness
and
a
fruity
yeast
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
dunkel
im
not
impressed
with
the
taste
at
all
im
not
even
sure
this
is
a
good
weiss
minus
the
crystal
malts
these
guys
should
add
some
more
crystal
malt
and
call
it
a
day
the
mouthfeel
is
way
too
light
and
the
co2
is
way
too
intense
drinkability
it
was
another
decent
affordable
german
beer
but
i
dont
think
i
would
ever
go
for
this
one
again
the
appearance
and
smell
was
there
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
was
just
off
if
im
ever
looking
for
a
dunkel
weizen
and
its
the
only
one
i
can
find
i
will
continue
to
look
around
pours
a
pretty
rubyrusset
color
with
an
offwhite
head
that
is
fine
bubbled
and
fluffy
sweet
darkfruit
smells
mingle
with
a
faint
banana
note
but
the
aroma
lacks
complexity
on
the
palate
big
carbonation
first
off
then
some
nice
acidity
and
lightly
fruity
malts
just
a
touch
of
spice
in
the
background
this
is
smoother
and
more
rounded
in
the
mouthfeel
than
its
hefeweizen
cousin
overall
this
is
a
solid
but
uninspiring
dunkelweizen
its
got
a
nicely
rounded
mouthfeel
and
some
easy
drinkability
but
not
the
depth
of
flavor
i
expect
from
the
style
drinks
easy
a
nice
example
of
dunkel
from
a
brewery
in
of
the
prettier
german
cities
i
visited
those
looking
for
a
huge
yeast
signature
may
find
this
lacking
overall
an
easy
drinker
good
looking
but
not
a
lot
of
pizzazz
good
refreshing
thirst
quencher
unassuming
but
not
much
to
bring
me
back
worth
a
try
the
flavor
is
a
big
array
of
banana
flavors
with
some
other
mild
fruit
flavors
oak
spices
cloves
coriander
sweet
syrup
and
just
a
slight
bite
of
alcohol
as
the
beer
warmed
these
flavors
formed
a
beautiful
cohesion
mouthfeel
was
medium
slightly
chewy
but
clean
this
beer
is
a
bit
filling
but
overall
a
great
dark
hefeweiss
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
would
buy
again
d
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
could
be
more
smooth
overall
but
it
is
a
german
afterall
pretty
solidly
to
type
d
a
little
bit
filling
it
actually
reminds
me
of
a
roggenbier
i
brewed
something
happened
where
there
wasnt
much
fermentable
sugar
so
the
hefe
yeast
didnt
impart
any
flavor
and
i
was
stuck
with
a
very
malty
very
full
bodied
beer
this
dunkel
is
not
what
id
expect
from
a
bavarian
hefe
d
drinkable
yet
not
as
much
as
other
ive
had
i
probably
wouldnt
get
again
and
would
stick
with
another
this
one
was
only
a
notch
or
so
above
average
all
the
way
around
except
for
appearance
this
thing
had
huge
bits
of
sediment
in
it
and
sedimentdebris
holds
alot
of
weight
with
me
with
certain
styles
the
dissolving
chunks
of
yeast
make
for
a
particularly
cloudy
brew
which
also
means
alot
to
me
in
certain
styles
this
may
be
the
nicest
looking
dunkelweiss
i
have
seen
in
a
long
time
perhaps
ever
medium
copper
brown
with
some
sediment
and
a
huge
rocky
offwhite
head
that
lasted
forever
smell
was
fairly
parforthecourse
for
the
style
although
i
got
exclusively
spicecloves
and
no
banana
on
this
one
taste
was
yeast
dark
cereal
and
spice
i
liked
it
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
but
so
is
the
mouthfeel
for
nearly
every
other
dunkelweiss
a
good
beer
and
a
great
style
pours
transparent
golden
brown
with
a
quicktoreceed
creamy
head
that
settles
to
a
thick
foam
and
lace
the
nose
features
toasted
caramel
malts
with
touches
of
banana
and
nuts
some
herbal
hop
notes
are
also
in
play
the
flavor
is
less
pleasing
somewhat
defective
sugary
carmel
is
strong
at
first
but
this
is
overshadowed
by
a
sour
diacetyl
and
phenollaced
finish
the
medium
thick
creamy
body
is
stingy
with
carbonation
not
especially
noteworthy
pours
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
decent
offwhite
head
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
light
clove
metallic
the
taste
is
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
spice
and
clove
this
brew
tends
to
be
more
on
the
malty
side
i
can
hardly
detect
any
of
the
hefe
qualities
the
feel
is
light
and
fizzy
maybe
a
bit
over
carbonated
finishes
quite
dry
a
decent
sample
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
a
bit
too
dry
a
nice
easytodrink
tasty
classic
dunkel
man
it
has
been
a
long
ass
time
since
i
have
had
a
dunkel
weizen
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
german
beer
it
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
from
magic
hat
a
murky
caramel
color
with
shades
of
light
and
dark
all
around
head
was
huge
at
first
then
faded
into
a
lacing
that
remained
right
up
until
the
end
of
the
glass
in
the
smell
was
the
distinct
aroma
of
warm
baked
banana
bread
with
blueberries
there
was
also
a
light
clove
presence
my
god
the
smell
was
lovely
taste
was
spicy
in
the
beginning
and
then
sort
of
doughy
in
the
end
not
what
i
would
call
extremely
balanced
but
that
is
what
made
it
all
the
better
taste
wise
body
of
this
beer
was
light
to
medium
and
ever
so
drinkable
the
low
alcohol
and
sheer
delectable
nature
of
this
beer
make
it
a
great
session
brew
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
three
bombers
of
this
and
still
wanting
more
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
right
up
there
with
the
weihenstephaner
dunkel
weizen
for
me
it
would
pair
well
with
lots
of
cooked
meats
i
bet
overall
a
delicious
refreshing
brew
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
its
like
im
back
in
munich
and
i
love
it
i
will
almost
certainly
be
buying
this
one
again
its
really
good
big
halfliter
german
bottle
brewed
with
wheat
and
barley
malt
hops
and
hop
extract
it
pours
into
the
weizen
glass
a
dark
ruddy
brown
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
two
finger
light
beige
head
that
leaves
mild
lacing
there
is
a
big
banana
and
bubblegum
aroma
with
tangy
wheat
clove
chocolate
and
maybe
even
some
smoke
very
nice
the
flavor
adds
to
this
greengrassy
and
freshcuthay
hops
and
unfortunately
a
touch
of
papercardboard
oxidation
it
has
a
highlycarbonated
light
body
that
evens
out
quickly
and
leaves
a
short
finish
not
too
bad
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
the
bottle
is
a
bit
fresher
mouthfeel
was
smooth
until
the
swallow
then
some
interesting
zestiness
this
was
my
first
dunkel
weizen
and
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
mouthfeel
an
earthy
hop
bitterness
is
tasted
but
it
immediately
gives
way
to
the
sweet
bready
malt
and
yeast
flavors
some
cloveish
notes
are
detected
a
good
froth
on
the
palate
and
it
stays
the
same
with
a
little
bitterness
surfacing
on
the
finish
excellent
tasting
brew
and
if
not
for
the
color
i
would
think
it
was
a
regular
hefeweizen
j
e
s
regular
hefeweizen
is
excellent
and
this
style
is
an
equally
good
offering
as
it
warmed
up
the
banana
and
yeast
flavors
bloomed
and
i
almost
felt
like
i
was
sipping
it
fresh
in
a
beer
garden
in
germany
very
tasty
and
sessionable
im
not
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
style
as
ive
had
limited
experience
but
here
goes
the
color
is
a
dark
brownorange
with
golden
highlight
a
very
thick
head
formed
as
i
poured
the
beer
into
my
duvel
tulip
glass
and
the
offwhite
bubbles
remained
until
the
beer
was
gone
i
noticed
an
immense
amount
of
sweetbread
in
the
aroma
along
with
a
mild
fruitiness
and
hay
the
flavor
is
quite
fruity
upfront
with
a
bit
of
cherry
followed
by
essence
of
banana
freshly
baked
bread
dominated
the
aftertaste
which
lingered
for
about
a
minute
after
swallowing
its
not
a
fullbodied
beer
the
texture
is
lean
but
thats
what
ive
been
told
to
expect
from
this
style
i
should
try
more
of
these
to
further
expand
my
palate
i
am
by
nature
not
a
fan
of
weissbiers
but
i
must
admit
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
the
yeast
strains
offered
a
nice
flavor
and
aroma
compliment
to
the
roasted
wheats
used
in
this
beer
normally
i
just
dont
care
for
the
aftertaste
and
spiced
character
of
hefeweizens
but
this
was
indeed
an
exception
the
brewers
create
a
best
of
both
worlds
feeling
with
enough
mouthfeel
and
rounded
flavors
without
the
imbalances
i
tend
to
find
in
weizens
drinkability
was
good
and
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
occasions
that
call
for
a
flavorful
but
lighter
bodied
beer
prost
d
very
crisp
and
clean
more
of
a
warm
weather
beer
i
could
see
myself
throwing
down
many
of
these
at
oktoberfest
please
refrain
from
throwing
in
a
slice
of
lemon
julius
echter
hefeweiss
dunkel
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
huge
off
white
head
from
a
brown
50
cl
bottle
some
banana
and
some
clove
in
the
aroma
but
also
some
bubblegum
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
little
thin
but
the
taste
is
pretty
good
not
much
of
the
banana
and
clove
thing
there
is
some
but
tropical
fruit
and
bubblegum
flavors
are
present
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
definitely
within
style
but
not
necessarily
what
im
looking
for
in
a
dunkel
weiss
a
bit
tart
and
pretty
drinkable
this
is
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
style
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
though
je
like
the
franz
has
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
very
full
and
coating
which
really
helps
to
push
aside
the
carbonation
i
think
that
the
fraz
is
better
in
this
regard
but
the
je
was
very
nice
as
well
drinkability
is
just
fine
i
could
down
this
in
big
gulps
while
i
do
think
that
the
franz
was
the
more
outstanding
beer
this
one
is
no
slouch
either
in
fact
this
will
score
a
bit
higher
based
on
the
weight
of
taste
another
awesome
beer
from
mr
echter
i
love
the
way
this
beer
looks
light
caramel
brown
color
cloudy
good
carbonation
does
resemble
banana
bread
in
taste
but
i
seem
to
taste
more
of
a
clove
mixed
with
lemon
kind
of
flavor
in
the
finish
all
together
great
although
i
dont
have
a
ton
to
compare
it
to
as
im
a
realitive
newcomer
to
the
style
i
really
dig
wheat
beers
and
im
a
huge
fan
of
dark
beers
too
this
seems
like
a
nice
middle
ground
and
a
great
beer
to
pair
with
anything
poured
from
the
bottle
to
a
brownishred
with
good
carbonation
and
a
thick
offwhite
head
that
stayed
atop
the
beer
throughout
the
entire
drink
and
reduced
to
excellent
lacing
up
and
down
the
glass
a
mild
aroma
of
wheat
bread
and
at
first
some
clove
spice
which
faded
by
midglass
flavor
was
more
of
the
tasty
bready
wheat
my
only
complaint
with
this
beer
was
the
very
thin
body
which
led
to
a
watery
palte
beside
thatr
this
was
a
darn
good
beer
ive
had
better
dunkels
but
im
at
a
loss
to
find
serious
fault
with
this
one
satisfying
and
a
true
example
of
the
style
i
can
imagine
that
bavarians
are
rightly
pround
of
mr
echter
drinkability
could
knock
a
few
back
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
goes
very
will
with
the
waning
fall
temperatures
in
texas
i
would
revisit
this
one
on
any
given
occasion
a
solid
brew
to
say
the
least
drinkability
refreshing
great
summer
thirst
quencher
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
is
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
the
beer
is
easily
sessionable
this
is
a
very
good
beer
drink
and
i
will
drink
more
at
a
later
date
drinkability
is
good
but
i
might
want
to
grab
something
else

strong

the

the
banana

dont
get

overwhelmed
theres
a
bit
of
a
minty

the

a
notable

malty

flavor
is
predominately
of
the
dark

chewy
and
nutty
the
phenols
are
not
very
intrusive
but
they
could
have
had
more
of
a

kind
of
tart
and
wheaty
in
the
finish
pleasantly
carbonated
with
a
decent
body
but
it
leaves
my
mouth
kind
of
sticky
this
is
a
pretty
nice
dunkelweizen
but
not
the
best
ive
had
certainly
this
is
a
better
offering
from
julius
echter
than
their
weisse
hell
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkel
weizen
it
pours
an
attractive
hazy
reddish
brown
with
liitle
light
making
it
all
the
way
through
there
is
a
nice
head
that
recedes
to
minimal
lace
the
smell
is
pretty
sweet
and
is
smells
like
suprise
fermented
wheat
it
tastes
bready
with
strong
bananas
and
a
little
cloves
there
is
also
a
touch
of
cherry
sweetness
although
it
is
not
as
sweet
as
the
smell
led
me
to
believe
it
is
pretty
refreshing
but
the
sweetness
tempers
the
drinkability
on
the
whole
it
is
very
clean
murky
brownish
color
hazy
and
definitely
not
clear
some
off
white
head
some

so
murky
smells
lemony
and
wheaty
as
it
should
not
too
much
else
tastes
wheaty

some
vanilla

a
bit
tart

spicy
and
some
tart
apple
in
there
mouthfeel
is
full
and
sudsy
slightly
slick
pretty
drinkable
very
refreshing
quite
nice
opinion
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
clean
and
has
a
nicely
reserved
ester
profile
for
the
style
the
wheat
edge
is
definitely
there
and
makes
it
more
refreshing
i
personally
think
that
it
was
ok
but
there
wasnt
really
much
to
set
it
apart
i
like
the
fact
that
it
is
so
clean
but
this
could
be
considered
a
flaw

fairly

mouthfeel
its

im
a

but
this
one
is
just
lacking

am

more
and

and
this
one
is
helping
me
convert
more
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
mug
from
a
bottle
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
1
inch
head
it
has
the
aroma
of
malt
bread
and
spices
it
has
a
nice
yeasty
flavor
with
hints
of
winter
spices
possibly
cloves
it
taste
is
very
rich
and
creamy
nice
i
do
love
a
good
dunkle
weizen
this
is
still
better
off
tap
which
is
what
led
me
to
buy
some
bottles
and
even
better
on
a
hot
day
bottle
poured
a
dark
cloudy
brown
color
dunkel
with
a
huge
foamy
dirty
brown
head
with
pretty
good
retention
aroma
of
banana
with
hints
of
cinnamon
with
sweet
strong
malt
taste
has
notes
of
banana
with
some
sweet
malt
but
not
much
bitterness
is
discernable
creamy
texture
is
really
enjoyable
and
body
is
fuller
then
average
the
flavor
was
rich
and
caramely
with
overtones
of
sourdough
bread
almost
like
a
spiced
carmel
coffee
with
no
coffee
flavor
if
that
makes
any
sense
it
had
a
quick
aftertaste
of
bitter
apples
this
was
my
first
dunkel
so
i
didnt
know
what
to
expect
i
was
a
little
taken
aback
as
it
was
not
what
i
thought
it
would
be
but
it
started
to
grow
on
me
and
by
the
end
i
was
interested
enough
to
want
to
try
more
of
the
style
i
will
definatly
be
on
the
lookout
for
my
next
dunkel
poured
a
mediumbrown
cloudy
color
with
absolutely
monstrous
tannish
head
that
refused
to
depart
smell
is
tremendous
with
strong
notes
of
spices
cloves
bananas
and
other
summer
fruitiness
taste
is
initially
a
strong
assault
of
breadlike
maltiness
with
enough
sweetness
caramel
to
make
it
interesting
very
smooth
and
creamy
finish
is
toasty
toffeelike
a
truly
excellent
beer
one
of
my
favorites
medium
body
and
easy
to
drink
not
as
good
at
the
hefeweizen
imo
but
a
decent
offering
d
not
all
that
remarkable
nice
aromas
good
flavors
yet
nothing
remarkable
good
enough
to
try
again
if
it
presents
itself
the
color
is
a
hazy
dark
brown
head
is
large
creamy
and
light
brown
carbonation
is
moderate
the
aroma
is
a
very
inviting
combination
of
dark
bread
malts
with
a
spicy
clove
aroma
mixed
in
throughout
taste
is
sweet
more
cookie
malts
than
bready
with
a
nice
yeasty
flavor
throughout
clove
flavor
adds
to
the
complexity
of
the
beer
with
a
welcomed
spiciness
mouthfeel
is
pretty
creamy
which
aids
the
overall
experience
drinkability
is
excellent
give
me
one
or
more
of
these
anytime
in
my
humble
opinion
this
the
standard
bavarian
dunkel
hefe
weisse
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
bananas
cloves
and
sweet
malty
wheat
tastes
like
more
of
the
same
with
a
slight
astringency
in
the
middle
and
a
clean
sweet
crisp
finish
highly
effervescent
of
course
and
medium
bodied
a
great
dunkel
i
think
the
hefe
is
a
little
better
but
this
is
still
a
winner
in
my
book
last
swigs
this
is
the
dunkel
model
banana
custard
prosit
this
one
pours
a
very
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
tall
head
that
falls
fast
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
spicy
but
has
hints
of
clove
and
maybe
some
apple
the
flavor
has
a
bread
feel
to
it
some
banana
flavors
as
well
as
some
spice
from
the
yeast
it
has
a
medium
body
and
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
little
odd
for
the
style
decent
dark
weizen
though
i
prefer
the
more
phenolic
end
of
the
spectrum
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
on
top
of
that
it
was
pretty
cheap
too
i
think
it
was
like
1
25
the
taste
was
a
good
wheat
taste
to
it
mixed
with
a
spritz
of
a
citrus
taste
it
was
cloudy
and
dark
with
an
off
white
head
that
was
pretty
thick
kind
of
a
chewy
thick
body
to
it
which
is
a
good
thing
more
on
the
malt
side
of
things
with
little
in
the
area
of
hops
if
your
looking
for
a
strong
conversion
beer
this
would
be
my
pick
this
poured
a
cloudy
tan
with
rich
foamy
head
that
retained
nicely
smell
was
banana
and
clove
spices
the
taste
was
nice
and
banana
like
but
not
as
rich
as
other
dunkels
ive
had
cloves
and
spices
also
mouthfeel
was
perhaps
a
bit
light
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
i
would
buy
these
again
but
there
are
definitely
a
couple
others
in
this
genre
that
are
superior
still
a
nice
dunkel
better
than
most
this
beer
is
okay
but
nothing
really
special
for
the
style
16
ounce
bottle
no
freshness

poured
a
dull
cloudy
brown
light
tan
head
initially
large
and
puffy
it

down
to
a
long

film
and
left
some

is
a

update
i
hadnt
even
seen
this
beer
in
about
six
years
then
caught
one
at
me
local
beer
store
and
decided
to
take
a
second
look
the
mouthfeel
was
much
better
which
led
me
to
believe
i
just
may
have
gotten
a
bad
bottle
before
the
head
again
was
a
beautiful
sight
even
for
a
weizen
the
yeast
continued
to
dominate
throughout
and
with
the
better
carbonation
and
lighter
feel
i
took
my
rating
up
a
few
notches
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
before
adding
the
yeast
from
the
bottle
the
head
is
nice
and
big
about
3
5
fingers
high
i
have
to
wait
for
it
to
fall
a
bit
before
i
finish
my
pour
the
yeast
darkens
the
beer
a
little
bit
and
the
head
falls
to
about
2
fingers
the
nose
is
dominated
by
the
sweetness
of
the
wheat
with
the
estery
banana
hiding
behind
it
as
the
beer
warms
the
banana
comes
through
more
i
like
how
this
beer
tastes
there
is
a
nice
balance
between
the
wheat
and
the
banana
neither
one
taking
the
lead
but
both
of
them
coming
in
first
i
like
it
the
beer
is
thick
and
creamy
from
the
yeast
just
what
i
expected
drinkability
is
high
for
this
one
better
than
i
had
expected
it
is
not
sitting
heavy
as
i
would
expect
from
the
thickness
each
drink
makes
me
want
another
that
is
good
in
my
book
murky
brown
like
unfiltered
apple
cider
heavy
yeasty
smell
thick
dense
creamy
offwhite
head
that
looks
as
luscious
as
icecream
and
puts
up
a
stubborn
bitter
barrier
to
the
beer
the
beer
is
mellow
and
malty
with
undertones
of
banana
and
spice
clove
cinnamon
and
vanilla
creamy
mouthfeel
tangy
finish
as
it
warms
i
also
warm
to
it
and
somehow
it
tastes
great
with
this
roast
beef
im
eating
i
could
have
another
one
of
the
best
dunkelweizens
ive
had
the
malty
finish
is
what
i
look
for
in
dunkels
assuming
the
requisite
bananaclove
thing
cleanly
fermented
easy
to
drink
with
a
nice
body
and
great
taste
i
would
seek
this
one
out
again
this
is
a
good
drink
i
would
order
again
muddy
orange
color
with
a
thick
head
that
looks
like
the
puffy
head
of
a
root
beer
float
that
eventually
settles
but
takes
its
time
a
nice
yeasty
fruit
flavor
bananacloveeven
a
bit
lemony
but
not
strong
goes
down
very
smooth
not
as
powerfully
sweet
or
carbonated
as
other
hefeweisses
there
was
a
ton
of
yeast
in
this
bottle
it
settled
for
a
week
at
my
house
and
i
still
found
yeast
in
the
bottle
neck
accounting
for
the
cloudydirty
color
if
you
like
the
added
yeasty
flavor
not
much
of
a
smell
from
this
one
but
very
drinkable
id
grab
another
one
of
these
in
the
future
this
is
like
writing
two
different
reviews
one
about
the
first
pour
and
the
second
with
the
yeast
swirled
in
initial
pour
reveals
a
clear
mahoganyorange
when
held
to
the
light
and
an
enormous
rocky
ivory
colored
head
huge
sheets
of
lace
are
left
behind
second
pour
is
decidedly
hazy
tantilizing
aroma
of
banana
and
clove
backed
by
grapefruit
and
some
more
spices
the
second
pour
obviously
adds
some
yeasty
bread
aromas
mouthfeel
reveals
a
smooth
medium
body
with
active
carbonation
taste
is
plenty
malty
for
me
with
some
hints
of
chocolate
and
wheat
bread
the
spiciness
noted
in
the
nose
is
also
prominent
in
the
flavor
profile
unripe
banana
lends
a
citrus
note
as
well
yeastiness
takes
over
the
finish
with
fresh
baked
bread
being
overpowered
by
an
earthy
mushroomy
finish
aftertaste
still
retains
plenty
of
sweetness
this
was
surprisingly
complex
and
difficult
to
review
if
youre
opening
a
bottle
that
has
been
sitting
for
a
few
weeks
you
will
get
two
different
expereinces
if
you
pour
the
top
half
first
swirling
the
settled
yeast
for
the
second
half
is
going
to
change
things
considerably
in
appearance
taste
and
aroma
personally
i
preferred
the
first
half
for
its
clear
appearance
with
mostly
sweet
taste
the
addition
of
the
settled
yeast
during
the
second
pour
will
tame
down
the
sweetness
and
add
an
earthiness
that
many
may
prefer
a
very
fine
dunkel
weiss
here
with
some
notable
characteristics
drinkabilitynotes
a
surprisingly
excellent
example
of
the
style
very

and
sure
to
please
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
orangetinted
brown
with
a
massive
rocky
head
take
care
in
pouring
this
one
folks
the
aroma
is
of
overripe
bananas
and
with
a
little
bit
of
clove
but
the
smell
takes
some
effort
to
pick
up
banana
flavor
shows
up
dominantly
in
the
flavor
backed
by
a
fair
degree
of
sweet
breadiness
which
stops
short
of
cloying
a
tealike
twang
from
the
yeast
breaks
up
the
sweetness
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
i
expected
a
little
more
maltiness
perhaps
its
my
own
faulty
perception
but
i
expect
the
dunkel
hefes
to
have
a
more
developed
maltiness
than
their
lighter
brethren
and
this
one
is
a
little
on
the
light
side
not
as
good
as
the
regular
echter
hefeweiss
too
sweet
this
is
a
murky
brown
beer
with
excellent
offwhite
head
and
good
retention
the
aroma
is
of
mild
yeast
and
fruitiness
but
not
particularly
strong
in
this
segment
i
would
prefer
a
bit
more
strength
of
smell
taste
is
quite
good
but
somewhat
watery
compared
to
other
beers
within
the
style
mouthfeel
is
also
slightly
thin
compared
to
expectation
not
bad
but
not
strong
because
it
is
slightly
thin
it
maintains
better
than
average
drinkability
i
like
this
offering
but
i
feel
there
are
better
dark
hefes
to
be
had
the
nose
is
yeasty
and
speaks
also
of
a
nice
malt
base
plenty
of
chocolate
notes
mixed
in
here
as
well
along
with

of

flavor
is
of

bits
of
chocolate

in
the
feel
is
smooth
but
thin
and
a
bit

my
taste
good
drinkability
on
this
easy

beer
this
is
a
real
good
dunkel
and
fits
right
in
with
the
best
of
the
style
nice
chocolate
undertones
with
the
typical
large
foamy
head
and
clove
and
banana
notes
nothing
to
stand
out
over
the
other
top
examples
but
as
good
as
any
other
than

if
you
like
the
style
definitely
try
this

tasty
a
must

didnt
see
that
coming
this
is
a
great
representation
of
a
dark
wheat
beer
it
is
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
big
thick
ivory
head

dissolved
quickly
to
a
ring
around

aroma
of
clove

over
the
beer

sip

bodied
brew

with
a
mild

is

followed
by

this
may
keep
me
coming
back
for
more

good
not
so
dark
nor

on

these

are
the

wheat
beer
and
of
the
dark
kind
too
boot
bordering
on
a
weizenbock
imo
well
rounded
balanced
and
pretty
drinkable
worth
a
go
o
im
not
sure
how
old
this
beer
was
but
i
only
drank
half
a
glass
and
then
introduced
it
to
my
kitchen
sink
overall
its
a
solid
beer
tasty
and
enjoyable
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
by
any
means
but
id
say
its
a
keeper
this
is
a
respectable
dunkelweizen
not
brilliant
but
respectable
it
pours
a
slightly
bright
amber
color
which
isnt
characteristic
for
the
style
as
this
should
be
a
touch
more
dirty
water
cloudy
brown
the
beer
is
plenty
carbonated
with
not
much
head
or
retention
no
lace
at
all
the
beer
is
a
bit
more
full
bodied
than
you
typically
find
in
the
style
with
just
enough
of
a
coarse
mouthfeel
to
let
you
know
that
this
is
a
wheat
beer
there
is
a
bit
more
caramel
in
the
taste
than
i
expected
more
sweet
malts
too
some
cloying
malty
notes
definitely
crystal
malts
at
play
here
the
is
a
touch
of
floral
texture
to
the
beer
with
a
slightly
syrupy
consistency
a
slightly
musty
finish
but
still
relatively
sweet
throughout
this
is
a
decent
not
brilliant
dvery
drinkable
has
a
nice
bready
taste
to
it
that
makes
it
easy
to
drink
drinkability
my
new
favorite
from
the
brewery
this
is
a
nice
bready
brew
that
hides
the
alcohol
well
i
could
see
myself
spending
a
night
with
a
couple
of
these
light
body
with
an
smooth
feel
from
start
to
finish
only
a
minimal
amount
of
lingering
bitterness
very
drinkable
a
growler
went
down
in
a
night
first
sip
reveals
an
average
to
light
body
with
mild
carbonation
that
gently
rolls
across
my
palate
flavor
is
as
the
nose
advertises
with
sweet
malt
dominating
the
beer
i
get
some
caramel
and
then
a
bit
of
fruit
and
some
wheat
twangyness
mixed
together
no
hops
and
no
booze
to
be
detected
the
beer
is
a
nice
easy
drinker
and
is
pretty
sweet
while
not
the
most
outstanding
dunkel
ive
had
it
is
a
solid
representative
and
is
worth
the
4
i
paid
for
a
bomber
nice
slow
beer
but
can
see
the
taste
becoming
blah
after
a
22oz
bottle
would
definitely
get
again
as
a
treat
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
has
characteristics
of
a
hefeweizen
but
at
a
more
mellow
level
its
more
bready
with
a
nice
balance
of
spice
and
sweet
malt
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
there
seems
to
be
a
big
more
then
there
ends
up
being
in
the
end
this
goes
down
well
and
leaves
that
fudge
like
flavor
of
an
aftertaste
that
is
welcoming
picked
up
a
growler
to
try
the
new
seasonal
release
from
bhb
poured
into
stemmed
beer
glasses
dark
caramel
color
to
the
body
with
a
nice
white
head
smell
had
a
burnt
sugar
and
spice
smell
to
it
lots
of
malt
in
the
flavor
just
a
hint
also
of
chocolate
and
ripe
fruit
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
as
it
had
a
proper
body
to
it
and
at
the
same
time
was
smooth
to
drink
drinkability
was
high
as
the
abv
was
very
well
hidden
and
the
overall
taste
was
appealing
a
great
new
addition
to
the
blue
hills
portfolio
that
i
will
definitely
be
having
again
great
dark
copper
color
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
head
bunches
of
roasted
malt
and
chestnut
in
the
nose
and
flavor
but
very
thin
in
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
liked
it
a
bunch
amber
in
color
with
a
moderate
haze
and
a
thin
head
the
smell
is
classic
dunked
yeast
and
wheat
clean
i
didnt
get
much
chestnut
at
first
but
it
comes
forth
as
you
enjoy
the
beer
dryish
nice
wheat
and
hop
character
enjoyable
got
this
as
an
extra
in
a
trade
the
size
is
perfect
poured
into
a
pint
good
clarity
dark
amber
color
i
got
the
slightest
hazelnut
in
the
nose
very
faint
hazelnut
in
the
taste
but
it
was
there
a
very
refreshing
dunkel
that
offered
a
great
break
from
all
the
big
beers
ive
been
drinking
lately
an
overall
good
beer
and
im
glad
i
tried
it
finishing
with
a
slight
colalike
tack
the
beers
semidry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
is
just
shy
of
the
maltydry
finish
of
authentic
german
dark
wheat
ale
and
with
the
bitter
hop
presence
to
compromise
yet
theres
the
soothing
taste
of
chestnut
to
give
a
buttery
and
toasty
elegance
thats
not
often
reconciled
in
even
craft
beer
aroma
is
somewhat
sulfur
toasted
malt
and
wheat
flavor
reveals
burnt
malt
and
wheat
theres
a
citrus
note
underneath
not
pleasant
the
body
was
medium
with
adequate
carbonation
bottle
from
trade
amber
pour
with
thick
white
head
smell
is
sweet
nutty
taste
is
unique
that
earthiness
from
the
chestnuts
some
roasted
malt
flavor
cotton
candy
sweetness
banana
probably
wouldnt
do
this
one
again
chestnuts
beer
not
my
thing
but
can
see
how
others
might
like
it
o
my
first
from
this
brewery
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
impressed
not
normally
a
style
that
i
seek
out
but
most
definitely
enjoyed
and
would
have
again
probably
the
strongest
nut
character
i
have
had
but
they
found
a
way
to
really
make
it
work
like
an
amber
ale
with
nuts
and
i
mean
a
lot
of
nuts
tasty
and
rather
unique
i
mean
ive
had
some
beers
with
nut
in
the
name
but
none
of
them
compare
to
this
nutty
one
feels
slightly
light
in
color
and
body
for
this
kind
of
beer
but
not
in
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
a
black
ipa
in
that
way
heavily
nutty
in
a
really
nice
way
overall
not
a
pleasant
beer
after
a
few
sips
copper
penny
color
just
a
thin
wisp
of
carbonation
covers
half
of
the
top
of
this
brew
pretty
good
clarity
aroma
is
definitely
nutty
and
malty
with
a
hint
of
banana
esters
the
front
of
the
palate
is
very
nutty
and
on
the
back
end
i
get
the
banana
flavor
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
and
refreshing
but
maybe
a
bit
too
thin
drinks
okay
kind
of
middling
as
brown
ales
go
you
can
taste
the
chestnuts
to
be
sure
was
hoping
for
better
on
this
one
o
enjoyable
beer
without
being
in
your
face
medium
texture
in
the
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
solid
brew
glad
its
available
in
bottles
now
by
the
way
another
plus
for
this
brew
is
that
it
comes
in
a
euro
bottle
which
is
a
pint
and
7
oz
more
bang
for
the
buck
o
i
have
been
really
looking
forward
to
having
this
one
ever
since
i
picked
it
up
at
whole
foods
in
st
louis
mo
still
fresh
tasting
over
a
month
later
here
in
china
has
some
great
weizen
bock
qualities
which
happens
to
be
one
of
my
favourite
styles
very
flavourful
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
hold
of
it
great
by
itself
it
would
go
well
with
medium
aged
cheeses
overall
this
would
be
a
good
everyday
beer
if
you
were
looking
for
one
with
an
emphasis
on
spices
a
little
lighter
and
spicier
in
flavor
than
i
prefer
but
reminiscent
of
traditional
belgian
beers
that
are
similarly
spiced
5

single
finger
head
with
little
retention
but
nice
lacing
on
a
hazy
orange
with
golden
hue
body
aroma
of
citrus
mostly
orange
peel
and
pineapple
with
candy
sugar
as
well
flavor
is
much
more
dynamic
with
citrus
up
front
but
an
almost
nutty
and
woody
oak
presence
in
the
background
hint
of
toasted
malts
as
well
medium
body
an
moderate
carbonation
drinkable
and
different
but
bit
amazing
a
beer
that
would
pear
well
with
many
foods
though
flavor
profile
is
pleasing
to
the
palate
and
wellnuanced
i
get
a
hint
of
malty
and
lightly
toasty
nuts
chestnut
and
a
wisp
of
light
citrus
hops
at
the
finish
i
drank
this
one
almost
room
temperature
and
it
was
a
delicious
and
worthwhile
experience
very
good
pours
a
hazed
slighty
orange
tinted
hazlenut
brown
little
to
no
head
only
some
offwhite
rings
on
the
outer
edges
mild
nose
with
faint
roasted
nuts
light
caramel
and
a
somewhat
baked
dessert
profile
brown
sugar
cinnamon
nutmeg
taste
adds
a
splash
of
floral
and
herbal
qualities
but
the
main
notes
are
still
the
lightly
toasted
nuts
light
caramel
and
nougat
like
sweetness
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
lightly
watery
and
undercarbonated
some
positive
notes
but
washed
out
by
the
thin
body
and
weak
scent
and
flavor
profile
overall
ok
but
not
great
very
interesting
and
unique
but
not
a
beer
i
could
drink
much
of
as
it
has
a
lot
of
weird
flavors
for
a
beer
o
malty
nut
focused
session
beer
feels
medium
in
body
a
little
carbonated
but
not
too
much
and
wetting
to
the
palate
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
ucbc
brews
very
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
nice
hop
notes
mixed
with
great
malt
notes
and
an
interesting
infusion
of
chestnuts
served
this
beer
on
tap
at
the
brewery
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
amber
orange
color
produced
an
average
white
head
excellent
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
of
this
spiced
beer
consisted
of
sweet
malted
grain
and
some
spice
nutmeg
perhaps
medium
in
body
this
ale
had
a
backbone
of
sweet
malted
grain
and
some
spicy
nutmeg
brewed
with
chestnuts
however
i
cant
really
detect
much
of
a
nutty
flavor
finishes
with
a
citric
hop
flair
overall
great
session

unique
something
i
would
order

30
seconds

i
can
taste
some
sort
of

is
sweet

strawberries
along

a
good

i
definitely
like

could

matter

i

it
would
be
better
on

light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
fluid
feel
overall
a
damn
tasty
dunkelweizen
well
worthy
of
its
lofty
reputation
overall
another
great
example
of
the
traditional
german
wheat
beer
from
weihenstephan
a
classic
good
value
too
for
an
equivalent
of
au70
a
case
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
i
have
had
well
worth
it
i
had
this
side
by
side
with
ayinger
urweiss
and
preferred
the
ayinger
comparably
they
were
very
similar
in
flavor
but
the
ayinger
had
it
beat
in
aroma
and
had
a
little
more
body
to
it
i
will
come
back
to
this
beer
again
as
i
am
a
huge
fan
ofweihenstephanersoriginal
hefeweissbier
and
they
are
great
values
at
note
to
self
buy
more
overall
quite
nice
again
weihenstephaner
delivers
the
standard
for
a
great
german
beer
i
like
this
a
bit
better
than
the
hefeweisen
from
the
same
brewer
its
more
subdued
in
its
flavoring
but
not
at
all
boring
just
tasty
as
heck
pours
a
dark
browncopper
color
with
a
good
4finger
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
down
to
a
good
12
finger
a
good
amount
of
lacing
is
seen
that
sticks
to
the
glass
great
aroma
of
german
malts
and
hops
with
a
dark
bread
aroma
as
well
even
more
going
on
with
the
taste
as
this
is
very
flavorful
more
with
every
sip
mediumfull
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
but
not
a
heavy
beer
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
this
is
a
fantastic
brew
like
their
others
since
this
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
from
1040
prost
this
is
a
very
delicious
hearty
and
satisfying
beer
with
an
alluring
appearance
delightful
aroma
and
invigorating
taste
ahhhh
an
incredible
drinker
pours
dark
amber
with
fairly
heavy
carbonation
smell
is
bananaclove
with
a
hint
of
yeast
taste
picks
up
the
banana
and
clove
right
away
but
the
maltiness
and
tinge
of
the
roasted
malts
comes
through
the
flavor
explodes
in
your
mouth
is
there
a
better
summertime
beer
than
this
german
purity
and
craftsmanship
at
play
here
very
solid
beer
unsurprisingly
nice
balance
enjoyable
flavors
great
feel
and
appearance
o
a
fantastic
example
of
the
style
from
a
world
class
brewery
definitely
hits
all
the
right
notes
with
no
apparent
faults
o
clean
and
easy
drinking
a
superb
dark
hefe
o
no
ones
seems
to
do
weizen
styles
better
than
the
germans
while
the
usas
best
offering
are
often
hop
forward
weihenstephaner
always
seems
to
brew
beer
that
is
complex
and
interesting
without
going
to
extremes
this
one
is
a
definite
yes
as
daniel
bryan
would
say
o
fantastic
best
example
of
the
style
i
have
had
and
a
definitely
rebuy
well
crafted
overall
one
of
the
best
dunkels
out
there
and
is
always
good
to
have
some
on
hand
o
4
this
beer
is
very
nice
however
it
is
not
particularly
interesting
as
mentioned
above
its
very
similar
to
the
original
version
but
theres
a
little
less
going
on
i
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
roasted
malt
to
come
through
on
the
nose
and
palate
but
its
still
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
overall
just
a
fantastic
beer
weihenstephaner
makes
the
best
hefeweizen
in
the
world
and
they
certainly
can
throw
their
hat
into
the
ring
on
dunkelweizen
as
wellif
you
like
clove
and
spice
and
everything
nice
i
also
must
say
that
the
flavor
profiles
come
through
a
lot
more
aggressively
on
tap
than
when
ive
had
this
out
of
the
bottle
not
sure
if
thats
due
to
a
freshness
issue
and
the
likelihood
that
a
keg
will
be
fresher
than
a
bottle
but
this
is
by
far
the
most
ive
ever
enjoyed
this
beer
overall
a
delicious
dunkel
a
dunkel
that
cannot
disappoint
o
great
dunkel
would
definitely
buy
again
taste
is
super
malty
the
wheat
is
everywhere
buttery
and
slightly
sweet
but
not
overly
so
crisp
and
zesty
almost
blueberry
flavor
malt
all
the
way
through
to
the
end
nothing
harsh
very
mild
in
all
respects
very
smooth
feel
nice
carbonation
goes
down
easy
very
drinkable
o
this
is
a
mellow
beer
with
a
nice
malty
wheat
taste
almost
no
bitterness
and
very
enjoyable
this
pintplus
bottle
was
purchased
for
3
49
at
hennessey
grocery
in
butte
montana
this
strikes
me
as
quite
an
excellent
deal
considering
the
obvious
excellence
of
this
beer
and
the
distance
traveled
kudos
to
the
hennessey
for
making
this
exotic
foreign
beer
available
in
my
little
corner
of
the
mountains
good
representation
of
the
style
although
ive
enjoyed
others
from
the
style
more
refreshing
complex
and
positively
an
ideal
hefeweizen
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
german
style
dunkel
weiss
o
not
only
an
excellent
example
of
this
classic
style
easily
found
here
in
chicago
and
reasonably
priced
overall
not
that
different
from
the
classical
hefeweissbier
superb
yet
relatively
simple
play
of
the
classical
banana
clove
formation
that
looks
and
feel
good
expected
a
bit
more
contribution
from
the
darker
malts
tho
othis
is
yet
another
good
wheat
beer
from
weihenstephan
i
dont
know
that
this
brew
provides
the
malt
flavors
i
would
expect
from
the
style
which
hurts
the
score
but
the
wheat
beer
aspect
of
this
thing
is
nailed
good
looks
nice
feel
inviting
aroma
but
a
bit
mild
on
the
palate

ive
never

which
sucks
having
lived
in
germany
so
long
but
ive
recently
had
some
great
experiences
with
them
and
have
decided
to
reexplore
the
style
this
is
an
amazingly
flavorful
beer
thats
hugely
drinkable
extremely
well
balanced
it
will
definitely
be
restocked

lots

i
dont

that
was

great
for
a
starter
at
a
beer
tasting
party
im
not
a

but
this
is
pretty
good
the
beer
poured
a
hazy
brown
with
12

thick

that
is
leaving
a
spotty

the
scent
and
taste
carries
hints
of

along
with
a
touch
of
roast
and
earth
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
and
worth
a

one

is

another
solid

from

poured
from
a

rather

smooth
as

as
is

there
are
a

trumping

there
is
ample

as
well
along
with
what
registers
as
vanilla
to
my
palate
nice
banana
bread
effect
with
clove
and
allspice
accents
some
sultana
raisin
and
cooked
pears
a
tinge
of
berry
great
stuff
the
malt
flavors
are
distinguished
and
classy
not
aggressive
leaving
plenty
of
room
for
the
spice
and
fruit
to
shine
through
the

is
amazing
an
essential
and
iconic
example
of
the

another
incredible

these
guys
cant

fairly

with

forever
aromas
of

with

with
a
solid
shot
of
caramelized
brown
sugary
malt
the
flavor
is

medium

a

dangerously
drinkable
not
horribly
complex
but
definitely
a
solid
quaffer
o
its
been
so
long
since
ive
had
this
gem
too
long
this
is
on
equal
terms
with
all
the
other
favorites
from
weihenstephan
the
stick
to
traditional
german
styles
and
rightfully
so
its
delicious
and
they
do
it
as
good
as
anyone
ill
buy
this
again
and
again
its
just
another
solid
and
truly
great
wheat
beer
from
this
german
genius
of
a
brewery
this
wins
the
look
is
great
ive
never
seen
another
beer
look
like
this
with
its
murky
brown
and
perfect
head
banana
is
the
main
flavor
i
find
in
both
smell
and
taste
it
really
is
excellent
all
around
this
is
an
outstanding
brew
absolutely
i
would
get
this
again
o
great
beer
i
wish
i
could
find
it
more
often
would
like
to
have
a
few
of
these
on
hand
at
all
times
got
the
weihenstaphan
variety
pack
as
an
early
christmas
present
from
my
mother
in
law
and
did
not
disappoint
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
dunkels
and
this
may
be
on
the
lighter
side
but
still
has
its
own
distinct
flavor
to
it
the
german
hops
take
precedent
in
this
beer
early
and
stay
through
all
the
way
to
the
last
sip
poured
a
great
dark
amber
color
with
a
cloudiness
to
it
as
well
a
small
finger
width
head
with
an
easy
not
overwhelming
aroma
sweet
malty
flavor
followed
by
a
fruitiness
however
not
overpowering
at
all
this
is
a
great
beer
from
a
great
brewery
and
i
will
always
hold
a
spot
in
my
heart
for
the
weihenstaphan
brewery
o
a
fine
example
of
a
dark
wheat
would
prefer
a
bit
more
depth
in
the
body
with
some
nuttiness
or
added
complexity
but
very
delicious
still
maybe
my
favorite
dunkelweizen
in
the
world
this
is
a
true
classic
a
delight
on
tap
if
you
can
get
it
o
wish
i
had
bought
more
than
one
this
thing
is
amazing
highly
recommended
one
of
my
favorite
beers
that
i
had
ticked
as
a
5
0
wanted
to
do
a
full
review
to
see
how
it
would
stand
up
to
the
individual
scrutiny
while
it
does
not
hold
up
the
5
0
in
each
category
this
is
one
of
the
best
tasting
beers
in
the
world
in
my
opinion
simply
outstanding
overall
top
quality
again
from
this
brewery
nice
light
smooth
easy
to
drink
flavors
nice
balance
nice
flavor
i
wouldnt
take
this
over
the
original
hefe
but
its
still
quality
and
worth
a
drink
o
a
very
enjoyable
and
tasty
easy
drinker
with
lots
of
style
and
craft
an
excellent
dunkel
overall
i
thoughtfully
enjoyed
every
last
sip
this
is
a
mighty
fine
brew
and
it
is
great
that
our
german
brothers
and
sisters
want
to
share
it
with
us
cheers
overall
beautiful
beer
and
should
be
as
well
respected
as
it
is
not
my
favorite
from
weihenstephaner
but
still
remains
the
best
of
its
style
the
more
apparent
spices
and
toasted
malt
set
this
beer
apart
from
regular
weissbiers
and
for
that
reason
its
good
props
to
beer
love
pow
o
very
solid
brew
a
perfect
alternative
to
american
seasonal
fall
beers
weihenstephaner
seems
to
master
the
balance
between
drinkability
flavor
and
price

pours
a

with
a
nice
frothy
large

there
is
a
sweet
grilled

aroma
the
taste
is
complex
lots
of
crisp
wheat
and

undertones
with
a
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
candy
like
flavor
flavors
come
together
so
well
and
nice
crisp

not
overpowering
overall
wow
taste
is
wonderful
it
follows
the
aroma
very
closely
the
roasted
notes
are
a
bit
bigger
in
the
taste
than
the
are
in
the
aroma
banana
and
bubblegum
are
here
again
along
with
the
clove
but
it
seems
to
blend
better
in
this
one
compared
to
the
regular
hefe
the
feel
is
very
good
as
well
light
bodied
nicely
carbonated
and
coats
the
palate
perfectly
i
think
this
loses
nothing
from
their
other
hefe
quality
german
dink
for
a
quality
german
night
o
i
just
cant
think
of
a
scenario
where
id
rather
have
a
dunkel
over
a
weizenbock
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
big

that
is
slow
to
fade
away
smell
is
banana

banana
flavor
stands
out
the
most
with
some
of
the
spice
and
malt
flavor
in
there
as
well
medium

with
lower
amount
of

overall
a
great
beer
nice
and
smooth
without
the
weird
aftertaste
you
get
with
a
beer
this
style
o
a
very
tasty
and
refreshing
brew
just
seems
to
blur
any
lines
between
belgian
and
bavarian
more

i
expected
a

to
be

very

quite

an

beer
that
is
full
of
flavour
vibrant
is
my
favorite
word
to
describe
the
malt
character
of
a
good
hefe
its
a
beer
that
lets
its
malt
shine
this
one
flowed
like
silk
and
had
plenty
of
bread
to
offer
but
nothing
heavy
sweet
round
and
creamy
the
mouthfeel
is
supple
and
sensational
the
sweetness
lies
delicately
and
just
underneath
every
flavor
quality
giving
it
its
dark
character
with
the
nuts
and
grain
spirited
civilized
sensational
theres
a
good
reason
that
this
is
one
of
the
oldest
brewers
in
the
world
and
that
they
do
hefewiezens
so
well
o
i
love
their
hefeweizen
and
i
actually
like
this
one
more
the
dark
malt
bill
adds
a
ton
of
complexity
to
the
usual
hefeweizen
flavor
profile
it
goes
down
so
smooth
too
i
cant
believe
i
have
not
had
more
dunkelweizens
in
my
life
but
this
is
incredible
o
a
new
favorite
a
very
excellent
beer
that
will
go
with
about
anything
overallnot
surprisingly
it
is
great
beer
from
what
is
probably
my
favorite
brewery
it
should
please
any
beer
drinker
overall
now
this
is
a
dunkel
odthis
brought
a
lot
to
the
table
its
cheap
its
complex
its
easy
drinking
and
its
mysterious
i
can
see
why
anything
with
the
weihenstephaner
label
is
regarded
as
beer
royalty
o
again
wheat
beers
really
arent
my
style
this
is
one
of
if
not
the
best
wheat
beer
ive
ever
had
its
nothing
that
ill
sprint
to
the
store
to
buy
more
of
but
id
highly
recommend
it
to
any
wheat
beer
or
strong
flavored
beer
in
general
fans
bit
disappointing
but
only
in
comparison
with
hefeweissbier
by
the
same
brewery
this
is
still
outstanding
beer
not
great
fan
of
dunkelweizen
but
this
was
worth
trying
overall
really
nice
spectacular
really
and
can
almost
live
up
to
the
comparisons
to
its
lighter
brother
probably
something
that
would
be
enjoyed
most
in
spring
and
fall
given
the
overall
crispness
of
the
beer
but
retention
of
its
full
taste
although
could
certainly
be
enjoyed
any
time
serve
at
45f
to
bring
out
the
tastearoma
profile
o
still
prefer
the
standard
hefeweizen
but
this
is
certainly
up
there
among
the
best
beers
that
ive
had
recently
the
mouthfeel
in
particular
makes
it
a
joy
to
swish
around
and
explore
the
different
flavors
that
permeate
that
beautiful
beer
price

oz
bottle
o
this
is
a
great
example
of
this
style
from
a
brewery
who
excels
at
it
i
preferred
the
lighter
version
but
this
was
still
enjoyable
if
you
enjoy
the
german
style
i
would
definitely
look
this
beer
up
along
with
the
other
beers
from
weihenstephaner
if
youre
not
this
probably
wont
be
your
speed
overall
i
could
drink
this
all
day
especially
on
hot
summer
days
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
is
perfect
as
a
session
ale
overall
one
of
the
best
dunkels
out
there
and
while
weihenstephaner
may
have
the
best
hefe
i
think
i
prefer
franziskaners
dunkel
to
this
this
is
a
great
beer
and
a
fantastic
introduction
in
to
the
dunkel
style
im
loving
it
for
the
change
it
brings
but
if
i
had
a
choice
between
this
and
their
original
hefeweizen
id
have
to
pick
the
original
both
are
worth
a
definitely
shot
and
amazing
try
them
and
find
your
favorite
slightly
warming
very
light
effervescence
medium
bodied
slightly
watery
at
the
start
but
filling
in
nicely
midway
through
the
finish
good
stuff
maynard
overall
i
have
to
say
this
is
the
weakest
weihenstephaner
offering
i
have
had
i
have
no
issue
with
how
it
was
brewed
per
se
but
the
combination
of
flavors
or
lack
thereof
make
it
tough
to
say
i
would
want
to
have
this
again
o
its
definitely
a
nice
highly
drinkable
refreshing
beer
but
i
consider
this
more
of
a
hefeweissen
than
a
dunkle
i
think
its
good
but
for
me
it
didnt
quite
live
up
to
the
hype
85
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
although
relatively
simple
great
pricepoint
and
product
as
usual
for
weihenstephaner
prost
lampertland
m
sweet
with
mediumfull
body
and
a
nice
sharp
wheat
finish
overall
while
i
prefer
weihenstephaners
regular
hefe
better
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
dunkle
version
a
truly
delicious
wheat
beer
and
another
solid
offering
from
weihenstephaner
this
would
be
enjoyable
on
a
bright
day
at
a
beer
garden
overall
i
was
surprised
by
how
much
i
like
this
one
atmosphere
is
pretty
great
nice
head
and
lacing
nose
is
full
and
flavorful
flavor
is
nutty
and
malty
with
some
hints
of
caramel
very
well
balanced
overall
this
is
a
great
quaff
overall
this
is
a
great
dunkel
my
only
gripe
is
not
much
dark
fruit
or
dark
color
but
i
can
let
that
slide
since
this
beer
is
pure
delicious
pours
a
murky
burnt
honey
color
with
a
cap
of
thick
craggy
beige
foam
aroma
is
fairly
mild
smelling
of
caramel
banana
cloves
and
yeast
the
flavor
perfectly
matches
the
aroma
so
i
wont
reiterate
it
here
i
will
say
that
the
mouthfeel
is
divine
as
the
effervescent
carbonation
complements
the
flavor
and
body
perfectly
this
is
very
similar
to
their
hefeweizen
just
with
more
of
a
caramel
flavor
which
i
actually
find
to
be
a
little
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
with
that
said
its
right
for
the
style
and
theres
no
denying
the
execution
this
is
one
flavorful
and
refreshing
beer
a
wonderful
version
of
the
hefeweizen
that
weihenstephaner
makes
extremely
drinkable
and
smooth
great
flavors
i
prefer
bigger
malts
like
the
weizenbock
quite
good
however
o
its
a
worldclass
beer
regardless
of
personal
preferences
all
bas
should
find
their
way
here
at
some
point
it
is
an
exemplary
beer
definitely
more
malt
character
than
the
hefe
which
suits
my
palate
well
excellent
yeast
esters
drink
its
in
the
top
250
for
a
reason
i
like
the
hefe
better
though
if
you
love
malty
beers
youll
love
this
in
my
top
5
for
the
style
almost
opaque
brown
this
rich
malty
brew
has
a
nice
hop
spice
to
it
that
sets
it
apart
from
the
bland
counterparts
of
which
there
are
many
there
is
a
creamy
goodness
to
this
dunkel
that
eludes
the
price
and
is
well
worth
a
try
overall
impression
great
example
of
a
traditional
german
dunkelweizen
balancing
fruit
esters
with
some
dark
toasty
flavors
easily
quaffable
and
refreshingly
different
character
from
most
hefeweizens
o
really
a
solid
beer
great
flavors
complex
enjoyable
o
an
excellent
dunkelweizen
with
all
of
the
right
qualities
for
the
style
o
honestly
so
good
beeri
could
drink
it
instead
of
breakfast
o
a
fantastic
beer
and
a
great
darker
alternative
to
a
normal
hefeweizen
im
no
expert
but
probably
one
of
the
best
in
the
style
o
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
wheat
beer
and
its
the
first
time
ive
had
it
ill
be
seeking
out
more
dunkelweizens
in
the
near
future
o
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
overall
i
just
dont
think
this
bottle
was
very
fresh
still
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
overall
i
was
happily
surprised
by
this
beer
some
of
these
old
european
breweries
have
beer
that
tastes
remarkably
similar
mostly
due
to
the
purity
laws
but
this
beer
and
this
style
incredible
delightful
the
cost
on
this
beer
is
extremely
low
compared
to
the
quality
i
believe
it
was
around
3
dollars
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
o
very
good
dunkel
huge
sweet
malts
with
some
light
toast
notes
epic
value
at
under
4
bucks
per
bottle
the
pour
is
really
cloudy
brownish
pinkish
color
kind
of
odd
really
with
a
really
robust
pure
white
head
of
thick
foam
long
lasting
and
leaves
good
lace
the
color
is
funky
and
i
think
this
is
far
superior
on
tap
but
the
beer
itself
is
amazing
it
smells
like
good
german
hefe
yeast
and
dark
wheat
malt
some
solid
toast
on
the
grains
and
a
refreshing
citrus
element
the
flavor
is
identical
to
the
nose
rich
and
complex
quite
fruity
but
a
little
more
roast
than
the
weizenbock
or
the
regular
hef
i
like
the
additional
body
it
provides
there
is
a
nice
soft
feel
too
although
the
carbonation
is
still
quite
lively
its
traditional
its
cheap
and
its
damn
good
how
can
you
beat
that
i
think
of
the
four
ive
had
from
this
brewery
i
like
the
regular
hefe
the
best
but
all
have
been
extraordinary
again
the
value
cannot
be
beat
o
i
had
this
on
tap
and
absolutely
loved
it
i
am
not
as
impressed
with
the
bottled
version
it
might
be
an
old
bottle
that
being
said
i
would
not
hesitate
to
have
this
beer
on
tap
again
poured
into
a
weiss
beer
glass
which
developed
a
tan
frothy
head
head
was
full
and
lasting
with
little
lacing
aroma
was
hoppy
almost
grainy
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
malt
appearance
was
a
light
brown
straw
color
with
a
cloudy
hue
taste
was
clean
and
hoppy
with
hints
of
citrus
and
grain
and
slight
caramel
tasted
more
like
a
weiss
than
a
dark
weiss
aftertaste
was
clean
and
dry
with
a
light
dry
mouthfeel
o
a
delight
in
drinking
a
marvelous
hybrid
of
light
and
dark
recommended
overall
i
rate
this
right
up
there
with
the
hofbrau
dunkel
weisse
as
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
overall
this
is
an
exceptional
weissbier
however
i
made
a
cardinal
error
of
keeping
the
bottle
in
the
refrigerator
too
long
this
stopped
me
from
experiencing
the
full
flavors
of
the
beer
needless
to
say
this
is
an
amazing
beer
im
glad
i
got
around
to
reviewing
it
final
grade
4
33
a
solid
a
grade
although
i
have
always
been
a
pretty
big
hefeweizen
fan
dunkelweizen
acceptance
has
eluded
me
probably
because
there
have
never
been
any
particularly
good
ones
available
locally
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
changes
all
that
for
me
as
it
shows
the
same
level
of
quality
and
craftsmanship
as
their
flagship
hefe
even
though
i
probably
like
the
hefe
a
bit
more
this
stuff
is
still
a
strong
contender
in
the
wheat
beer
category
and
undoubtedly
the
best
dunkel
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
delicious
brew
and
no
fan
of
german
wheat
beer
should
hesitate
to
try
it
a
magnificent
selection
for
my
400th
review
on
ba
one
that
i
will
assuredly
pick
up
again
soon
the
beer
tastes
of
subdued
banana
spicy
clove
and
sweet
wheat
grain
it
begins
surprisingly
light
with
hints
of
plantains
before
opening
into
unripe
banana
flavors
with
spicy
clove
notes
and
then
folding
into
a
thick
wheat
grain
and
spice
flavoring
that
lasts
in
the
mouth
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
there
is
also
an
almostpear
flavor
alongside
the
banana
esters
of
the
yeast
and
there
also
rich
caramel
notes
alongside
the
wheat
grain
in
the
aftertaste
on
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
creamy
and
smooth
with
a
medium
body
carbonation
is
velvety
and
the
tongue
is
left
sticky
in
the
back
with
malty
saliva
while
the
rest
of
the
mouth
feels
quite
dry
overall
this
is
a
lovely
dunkelweizen
i
feel
that
some
of
the
rich
banana
esters
from
weihenstephans
hefeweizen
are
lost
here
in
the
darker
malts
which
is
too
bad
but
the
addition
of
heavy
wheat
grain
flavors
is
nice
the
smell
is
definitely
more
complex
than
the
taste
though
this
beer
is
a
classic
and
definitely
worthy
of
a
taste
though
i
hold
their
hefeweizen
up
as
a
better
beer
than
this
mouthfeel
is
thick
but
super
sessionable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
my
favorite

this
is
just
a

tasting

not
long
after
having
it
on
tap
they
had
some
bottles
at
the
lcbo
and
i
picked
up
a
bunch
of
them
overall
a
delicious
fulfilling
brew
like
their
hereweissbeir
but
more
flavorful
o
im
no
expert
on
the
style
but
id
say
this
does
the
style
justice
easy
to
drink
but
id
still
take
their
regular
hefeweizen
over
their
dark
c
overall
i
do
like
this
dunkel
but
was
not
wowed
by
it
maybe
my
palette
is
off
tonight
i
ought
to
give
it
another
go
not
as
good
as
the
classic
weihen
hefe
but
still
a
very
good
beer
more
yeast
and
malt
flavor
but
doesnt
seem
to
pull
together
as
well
as
the
classic
another
amazing
brew
by
weihenstephaner
hits
all
the
marks
and
traits
youd
expect
from
a
hefeweissbier
bananas
cloves
breads
yeast
toasty
malts
etc
remains
simple
while
exceeding
at
everything
it
does
this
is
a

the
best
part
is
that
its
readily

weihenstephaner
was
the
first
good
beer
that
i
had
many
years
ago
so
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
giving
their
other
offerings
a
try
for
quite
some
time
all
i
have
to
say
is
wowweeweewah
i
just
want
more
and
more
of
this
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
blew
me
away
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
wants
try
try
a
great
dunkel
weizen
or
any
type
of
very
good
beer
overall
this
is
my
standard
for
dunkelweiss
styles
its
the
first
one
i
ever
tried
ive
had
many
since
and
nothing
tops
the
weihenstephaner
version
i
guess
it
shouldnt
be
a
surprise
that
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
still
makes
some
of
the
best
beer
in
the
world
pours
an
amber
brown
colour
with
a
big
billowy
white
head
with
plenty
of
retention
lace
sticks
to
the
glass
a
little
bit
of
yeast
floats
in
the
glass
aroma
of
cloves
bananas
sweet
bready
malts
tastes
just
like
it
smells
reminds
me
of
spiced
banana
bread
mouthfeel
is
light
smooth
and
creamy
an
excellent
beer
an
ideal
dunkel
pours
a
hazy
brownish
orange
colour
two
fingers
of
white
head
quite
a
bit
of
lace
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
with
some
banana
and
bubblegum
lots
of
yeasty
qualities
clove
and
other
spice
there
as
well
almost
a
little
christmas
like
at
times
also
light
cocoachocolate
points
taste
is
of
darker
sweet
malts
dark
bread
like
bits
of
banana
and
slightly
yeasty
a
cocoa
like
sweetness
quite
spicy
clove
and
pepper
as
well
the
finish
had
a
bit
of
warm
spice
thats
kind
of
cinnamon
like
spicy
aftertaste
medium
and
fairly
active
carbonation
medium
body
and
a
touch
creamy
very
nice
stuff
here
very
drinkable
and
something
i
will
pick
up
as
frequent
as
possible
spectacular
on
a
nice
warm
day
4
7
46
overall
near
perfect
balance
hard
to
ark
for
any
improvement
here
maybe
slightly
more
malt
character
to
make
this
a
perfect
5
overall
i
really
love
the
kristalwiezen
better
but
this
beer
is
no
slouch
either
over
400
reviews
and
i
havent
drank
very
many
german
beers
yet
what
was
my
problem
really
liking
the
beers
that
this
brewery
makes
it
was
a
bit
of
an
eye
opener
for
me
will
be
trying
alot
more
of
beers
from
this
brewery
affordable
at
5
price
point
for
500ml
and
its
an
easy
beer
to
find
overall
i
didnt
really
like
it
at
first
but
i
drank
a
regular
hefeweis
followed
by
this
one
and
then
it
really
is
kind
of
weird
later
i
tried
it
just
as
a
starter
and
the
more
i
drink
it
the
better
it
seems
to
get
its
got
more
depth
to
it
than
i
thought
at
the
beginning
very
nice
refreshing
beer
with
different
flavors
each
time
you
drink
it
i
bought
the
big
bottle
of
this
and
could
have
easily
had
another
since
the
alcohol
was
nearly
undetectable
this
was
nicely
balanced
because
of
the
dark
malt
and
readily
enjoyable
anyone
looking
for
a
textbook
example
of
this
style
need
not
look
any
further
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
d
a
true
benchmark
for
the
style
much
like
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
is
to
the
traditional
hefeweizen
a
damn
tasty
beer
that
goes
down
so
smooth
every
beer
in
the
style
should
be
compared
to
this
overall
weihenstephaner
might
not
make
the
strongest
beer
but
drinking
quite
a
few
of
their
brews
you
dont
need
to
be
strong
to
be
the
best
this
dunkel
is
almost
borderline
perfect
just
by
the
first
taste
you
will
know
one
glass
isnt
enough
salud
it
is
a
little
humbling
to
critique
a
beer
produced
by
a
brewery
that
has
been
around
longer
than
my
entire
family
line
weihenstephan
has
once
again
gone
for
balance
over
potency
restraining
the
bananabubblegumclove
notes
you
might
expect
to
find
in
abundance
not
to
say
this
lacks
flavor
o
another
easy
drinker
from
weihenstephaner
the
more
i
try
from
this
brewery
the
more
i
appreciate
german
beer
smooth
and
kinda
light
medium
bodied
with
enough
carbonation
to
keep
it
interesting
as
you
drink
slightly
drying
overall
another
referencequality
beer
from
weihenstephaner
doa
overall
a
im
going
to
have
to
taste
this
sidebyside
with
the
regular
hefe
overall
nearly
as
impressive
as
their
hefe
if
not
its
equal
one
ill
definitely
buy
over
and
over
again
best
dunkelweizen
in
the
world
its
debatable
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
of
this
style
especially
when
tasted
fresh
at
the
brewery
o
an
outstanding
beer
best
of
the
style
ive
had
500
ml
bottle
into
signature
weizen
glass
bottled
222011
pours
super
hazy
red
orange
color
with
a
beautiful
3
finger
fairly
dense
off
white
head
with
incredible
retention
that
reduces
to
a
thick
cap
that
lasts
some
nice
thick
lacing
clings
to
the
glass
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
streaming
up
as
expected
took
me
a
while
to
pour
this
as
i
anticipated
aromas
of
huge
banana
clove
bubblegum
orange
wheat
bread
and
yeast
spices
huge
on
the
bubblegum
here
amazing
taste
of
orange
clove
bubblegum
bread
caramel
light
banana
pepper
and
yeast
spices
fairly
dry
on
the
finish
with
some
light
lingering
notes
of
citrus
clove
caramel
and
biscuit
on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
great
overall
balance
of
flavors
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
very
creamy
and
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
alcohol
is
pretty
much
invisible
and
this
drinks
incredible
smoothly
overall
this
is
a
fantastic
dunkelweizen
and
my
first
one
in
the
style
nice
amount
of
complexity
with
very
smooth
drinking
and
a
great
mouthfeel
i
will
definitely
have
it
again
o
super
simple
but
tasty
and
drinkability
is
off
the
scale
o
drinkable
but
with
accompanying
flavor
and
complexity
world
class
overall
this
is
my
second
rereview
i
didnt
get
it
the
first
time
not
sure
why
but
now
i
prefer
this
to
the
original
hefeweissbier
a
nice
beer
another
german
style
i
enjoy
definitely

wise
in

some

slightly

holds
together
really
well
but
is
a

watery
up

good
and
drinkable
but
nothing
really
wows
me
overall
the
beer
was
just
excellent
the

are
very

and
seem
to
complement

you
like

dark

or
both
this
beer
is
for
you
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
beer
my
one
complaint
would
be
that
it
is
a
tad
bit
sweet
but
it
is
just
a
minor

o
for
some
reason
i
just
feel
like
this
is
a
lesser
version
of
the
schneider
aventinus
although
it
has
great
qualities
the
taste
is
lacking
it
is
however
a
good
beer
o
i
love
this
beer
one
of
the
few
that
i
cannot
say
enough
good
things
about
i
really
enjoyed
the
hefeweissen
but
the
addition
of
dark
malts
in
this
edition
make
it
something
to
be
sought
after
given
the
fair
price
and
year
round
circulation
this
brew
will
be
in
my
fridge
on
a
regular
basis
overall
there
isnt
really
anything
bad
about
this
beer
and
most
everything
is
good
immensely
flavorful
yet
very
easy
to
drink
for
sure
my
favorite
beer
to
date
brings
something
to
the
table
that
other
beers
dont
this
is
the
very
definition
of
a
perfectly
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
cheers
o
very
very
good
beer
from
a
great
brewery
love
it
single
finger
head
with
nice
lacing
on
a
murky
brown
with
golden
hues
body
rich
dark
fruit
and
molasses
aroma
with
honey
notes
flavor
is
more
dark
fruit
with
a
caramel
malt
backbone
and
nice
banana
notes
medium
body
and
moderate
to
high
carbonation
i
really
likete
banana
notes
in
this
one
which
actually
are
orecelabt
for
the
degree
of
dark
fruit
taste
certainly
a
winner
might
have
to
try
one
from
a
different
store
to
compare
batches
definitely
one
of
the
best
dunkel
ever
existed
very
easy
drinkable
yet
another
great
brew
from
the
great
weihenstephaner
overall
its
alright
but
i
wasnt
totally
impressed
too
bad
because
i
like
the
kristalweizen
rjt
o
first
offering
from
this
place
and
i
can
see
why
they
have
been
around
so
long
overall
a
true
classic
poured
a
murky
milk
chocolate
brown
maybe
drawn
from
the
bottom
of
the
keg
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
leaving
some
sticky
lace
even
on
the
plastic
glass
with
some
moderate
retention
nose
has
banana
and
light
bubble
gum
as
per
the
regular
weissbier
a
bit
of
cocoa
and
caramel
as
well
adding
a
touch
of
dunkel
character
taste
has
caramel
banana
bubble
gum
light
cocoa
and
some
darker
malt
and
bread
notes
albeit
subtle
light
chalkiness
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
heavy
just
as
the
original
weiss
is
with
some
nice
texture
on
the
palate
moderate
to
high
carbonation
certainly
not
my
favourite
style
but
this
is
certainly
a
beer
i
could
entertain
more
often
if
it
was
more
available
overall
a
great
dunkel
that
is
the
standard
of
what
the
style
should
be
overall
this
was
a
terrific
beer
its
just
like
the
regular
hefeweiss
which
is
a
classic
brew
but
with
a
toffeelike
hint
to
the
flavor
overall
one
of
the
better
dunkelweizens
ive
had
may
prefer
the
hefeweizen
over
this
but
still
quite
good
kept
a
good
finger
of
head
throught
drinking
and
lots
of
lacing
present
at
the
finish
pours
out
a
cloudy
nutty
brown
with
a
creamy
tanned
head
smells
like
banana
nut
bread
with
cloves
little
toastiness
too
tastes
like
banana
nut
bread
too
little
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
creamy
fluffy
mouthfeel
as
always
weihenstephaner
puts
out
another
stellar
beer
overall
very
good
brew
that
fits
exactly
with
the
style
o
just
a
very
solid
beer
that
should
please
all
beer
lovers
and
even
none
beer
lovers
great
beer
for
any
time
of
year
and
any
occasion
notes
such
a
great
beer
top
to
bottom
cheers
overall
this
is
a
great
dunkelweizen
very
tasty
with
lots
of
good
features
cant
say
anything
bad
about
it
definitely
worth
a
try
should
be
a
staple
of
its
style
o
not
bad
hefe
oits
just
good
i
think
i
am
underwhelmed
slightly
just
because
i
expect
alot
better
from
them
pours
a
muddy
semitransparent
brown
big
frothy
white
head
sampled
directly
after
the
hefeweissbier
both
have
big
clove
banana
and
bubble
gum
aromas
though
this
one
is
a
little
more
subdued
light
on
carbonation
making
subsequent
sips
oh
so
easy
i
generally
dont
care
for
wheat
beers
but
i
may
have
to
revisit
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
very
elegant
flavors
and
seems
to
have
great
balance
with
the
flavors
the
wheat
still
shines
and
the
esters
seem
perfectly
placed
this
beer
will
leave
you
wanting
more
o
this
was
a
really
great
beer
weihenstephaner
brews
probably
my
favorite
classic
german
beers
will
probably
buy
again
soon
o
a
very
enjoyable
drinking
beer
that
can
be
consumed
at
any
time
of
the
day
highly
recommended
medium
mouthfeel
and
high
carbonation
o
rather
surprised
by
this
beer
and
the
lovely
qualities
as
it
warms
it
becomes
a
bit
too
cloy
though
the
banana
and
clove
becoming
too
much
cooler
though
closer
to
4045
its
incredibly
enjoyable
definately
would
buy
again
o
one
tasty
treat
weihenstepan
makes
world
class
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
worth
drinking
all
the
time
if
you
can
find
it
i
wish
these
guys
would
make
sixers
or
even
twelve
packs
for
me
to
always
have
on
hand
overall
this
is
delicious
one
of
the
best
german
beers
i
have
ever
had
o
i
love
this
beer
and
this
brewery
at
its
freshest
this
stuff
along
with
its
incredible
hefe
brother
is
just
german
beer
at
its
best
simple
full
flavoured
unpretentious
magnificant
session
beer
mf
very
light
in
the
mouth
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
beer
m
excellent
balance
between
bitterness
and
sweetness
starts
easy
and
little
sweet
turns
slowly
to
little
bitter
for
a
long
ending
full
of
flavor
a
straight
4
if
i
ever
saw
one
nothing
too
special
overall
a
excellent
world
class
beer
and
highly
recommended
i
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
deep
caramel
pour
big
foamy
head
no
lacing
big
notes
of
bubblegum
cloves
and
bannana
it
taste
like
it
smells
lingering
bubble
gum
finish
the
beer
is
light
in
body
high
carbonation
very
easy
drinking
this
one
is
a
classic
great
example
of
the
style
so
fresh
off
of
a
regular
weihenstephaner
this
one
pours
a
darker
brownish
opaque
more
lacing
on
this
one
very
clovey
and
banana
bread
smells
taste
is
good
very
fresh
but
more
toasty
than
the
regular
hefeweisse
unreal
banana
bread
flavors
coming
through
mouthfeel
is
medium
great
beer
id
be
pushed
to
say
amazing
drink
outstanding
and
sessionworthy
the
lightness
of
the
body
makes
this
an
easy
drinker
while
the
different
spices
invite
you
to
take
sip
after
sip
theres
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
so
it
may
not
appeal
to
everyone
but
its
a
good
representation
of
the
type
theyve
been
making
beer
for
a
billion
years
so
its
not
surprising
its
good
poured
a
murky
brownishamber
with
a
fluffy
eggshell
head
that
receded
quite
a
bit
but
rejuvenated
every
time
i
poured
more
from
the
bottle
aroma
of
sweet
malts
banana
esters
clove
and
yeast
taste
of
caramel
toasted
pumpernickel
banana
and
cloves
spicy
yeast
and
a
hint
of
honeydew
mediumbodied
generously
carbonated
and
quite
drinkable
pairing
cabbage
based
hearty
meals
cream
cheese
my
overall
feeling
is
that
its
good
but
lean
and
watery
just
a
tad
though
i
like
the
candied
malt
it
was
dandy
mo
smooth
and
creamy
every
wheat
beer
from
these
guys
are
very
good
maybe
even
standard
setting
pours
a
dark
copper
to
amber
with
lots
of
wheat
haze
and
great
lacing
has
a
small
ring
of
head
that
sticks
around
the
smell
has
a
very
nice
clove
and
banana
like
the
regular
hefe
with
other
more
belgian
spicy
malt
and
yeast
notes
bready
and
darker
ripe
fruit
all
of
which
translates
to
the
taste
the
taste
has
the
elements
of
the
smell
but
it
seems
muted
in
a
way
its
great
banana
ripe
dark
fruits
clove
but
it
seems
more
watery
to
me
nice
carbonation
accents
the
spice
overall
its
quite
nice
but
the
regular
hefe
is
just
so
divine
it
might
almost
be
effecting
my
review
definitely
worth
a
try
o
a
very
good
beer
very
representative
of
its
style
highly
recommended
o
very
good
beer
all
the
way
around
n
o
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
i
purchased
it
thinking
it
would
be
a
good
summertime
selection
i
could
drink
this
beer
anytime
i
wish
i
bought
more
than
just
the
one
bottle
ill
be
back
for
more
pours
a
dark
rubybrownish
hue
with
a
tall
1
off
white
head
smells
bright
of
typical
banana
and
clove
esters
taste
is
spot
on
dunkelweizen
and
the
best
version
i
have
ever
had
crisp
and
clean
without
a
strong
aftertaste
and
easy
drink
ability
of
this
beer
makes
it
an
excellent
summertime
treat
soft
and
sweet
it
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
their
standard
hefeweizen
this
dunkel
is
still
an
outstanding
beer
it
would
be
phenomenal
to
be
in
munich
having
a
glass
or
two
of
this
beer
if
you
see
this
brewery
in
your
store
grab
it
the
beer
poured
with
a
twofinger
head
and
a
cloudy
honeybrown
complexion
the
head
retention
was
good
seeing
as
the
head
lasted
throughout
the
aroma
was
pleasing
presenting
with
a
light
spiciness
fruity
esters
a
breadlike
heartiness
and
no
noticeable
hop
presence
the
taste
bore
a
strong
malt
sweetness
light
spiciness
on
the
tongue
and
cloves
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasing
with
a
light
coating
left
on
the
tongue
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
hearty
and
satisfying
o
an
interesting
meld
of
two
german
styles
results
if
a
very
drinkable
tasty
brew
id
like
to
see
this
style
more
often
overall
i
expected
to
enjoy
this
one
more
than
i
did
im
going
to
have
another
to
make
sure
i
got
an
alright
bottle
not
bad
just
not
amazing
either
o
overall
this
cant
be
missed
i
like
it
just
as
much
as
its
brother
which
is
one
of
my
favorites
this
beer
is
essential
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
or
cold
day
as
the
robustness
it
brings
makes
it
a
nice
winter
beer
while
the
refreshing
crispness
invites
summer
connections
a
perfect
yearround
beer
and
ideal
for
any
occasion
o
a
perfect
representation
of
this
type
of
beer
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
o
my
first
dunkelweizen
im
a
big
fan
of
the
popular
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
this
variation
is
quite
good
and
i
would
have
it
again
a
nice
complex
wheat
beer
excellent
beer
start
to
finish
this
was
one
of
my
first
overpours
in
a
long
time
just
broaching
the
lip
of
the
glass
once
it
finished
playing
around
it
settled
into
a
finger
of
lighttan
head
with
mild
retention
color
was
a
very
cloudy
orangishbrown
or
was
it
a
brownishorange
nose
was
very
clovespiceforward
underlain
by
banana
esters
i
am
finding
that
the
bubble
gum
scent
fades
when
overpowered
by
clove
yay
mouthfeel
was
full
approaching
creamy
with
lots
of
spicy
clove
flavors
up
front
with
the
banana
taking
a
backseat
now
here
is
another
beer
that
i
can
solidly
endorse
finish
continued
to
be
extremely
spicy
and
i
could
hardly
get
enough
i
must
mark
this
one
down
for
future
reference
d
ive
had
little
experience
with
dunkelweizen
but
would
still
venture
to
say
this
ranks
amongst
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
dont
find
it
sessionable
but
its
a
rich
delicious
beer
all
the
same
with
a
spicy
banana
bread
character
a
real
standout
the
taste
just
isnt
there
relative
to
what
i
want
it
to
be
the
initial
bursts
of
flavor
similar
to
the
nose
arent
there
and
it
comes
across
as
watery
the
finish
has
a
decent
caramelly
lingering
ring
and
its
really
quaffable
but
the
taste
i
wanted
just
isnt
there
kind
of
a
disappointment
o
pretty
cool
that
this
is
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
dating
back
to
1040
the
quality
is
definitely
there
not
too
heavy
wouldnt
turn
it
down
overall
it
was
a
tasty
beer
nice
and
refreshing
but
a
little
too
carbonated
for
me
would
definitely
drink
again
though
o
a
superb
wheat
beer
not
terribly
dark
but
a
nice
bundle
of
flavor
on
the
palate
try
this
if
you
love
wheat
beer
pours
a
murky
light
copper
hue
with
beautiful
carbonation
that
leaves
behind
a
creamy
two
finger
head
and
heaps
of
lacingthe
smell
is
banannadark
fruits
and
caramel
maltsthe
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
feels
velevty
smooth
and
the
taste
is
basically
the
same
as
on
the
nose
with
hints
of
banannacarameldark
plumschocolate
wheat
and
the
finish
is
dry
and
very
moreish
and
overall
a
very
tasty
drop
and
how
could
you
can
you
complain
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
cheers
o
pretty
tasty
like
how
the
dark
malt
bill
adds
some
complexity
the
combination
of
banana
bread
and
dark
fruit
was
really
good
despite
the
age
of
this
beer
i
cant
help
but
be
amazed
that
its
still
so
good
i
cant
wait
to
see
how
a
fresher
bottle
tastes
this
is
a
really
nice
beer
good
farm
both
warm
and
cold
weather
and
large
glasses
to
be
quaffed
heavily
some
smoked
salmon
on
rye
would
be
a
pretty
tasty
lunch
with
this
one
pumpkin
pie
oddly
enough
comes
to
mind
i
think
it
is
the
spices
and
other
fall
flavors
that
will
harmonize
well
of
course
this
is
a
german
beer
so
dont
forget
the
sausages
o
being
my
first
dunkel
i
dont
have
a
base
to
go
on
except
that
weihenstephaners
hefe
is
exceptional
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
caramel
malts
are
a
nice
deviation
from
a
typical
hefe
overall
the
best
of
the
3
weihenstephaners
ive
had
o
delicious
as
expected
from
a
weihenstephaner
refreshing
and
delicious
overall
really
nice
and
quite
a
surprise
a
nice
switchup
from
the
hefeweizen
which
i
find
makes
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
overall
a
shining
example
of
the
style
well
worth
trying
o
super
nice
dunkel
4
5
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
despite
my
traditional
dislike
of
hefes
o
great
beer
bravo
very
enjoyable
o
a
very
good
beer
especially
given
the
pricetoquality
ratio
definitely
something
id
like
to
have
in
reserve
to
share
with
friends
a
very
good
brew
overall
one
which
i
would
definitely
buy
again
my
favourite
weihenstephaner
o
a
great
beer
i
love
the
amount
you
receive
for
the
price
this
is
really
how
beer
should
be
made
o
this
is
my
second
german
dark
wheat
in
a
week
and
neither
has
disappointed
this
beer
is
very
sessionable
and
i
will
be
going
back
for
more
when
i
pass
by
the
preston
lcbo
again
i
could
enjoy
a
few
on
a
hot
afternoon
at
the
trailer
this
summer
now
that
i
have
access
to
these
beers
im
going
to
have
strike
a
deal
to
stock
up
for
summer
fantastic
stuff
cloudy
murky
mud
water
brown
with
an
off
white
thick
fluffy
head
that
leaves
beautiful
lace
the
smell
is
wonderful
but
subdued
bananas
faint
clove
sweet
caramel
the
front
of
the
taste
is
caramel
and
toffee
with
banana
following
the
banana
and
clove
are
subtle
its
nice
and
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
sweet
edge
o
a
very
solid
brew
that
i
can
see
myself
purchasing
regularly
o
d
i
dont
particularly
like
or
know
this
style
but
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
seek
it
out
in
germany
but
not
in
the
states
o
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
its
not
particularly
complex
but
its
still
quite
satisfying
to
drink
i
want
another
overall
dominant
this
is
a
classic
beer
that
has
so
much
to
offer
one
i
will
stock
forever
i
give
two
schlitz
for
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkeldark
prosit
overall
alright
i
could
have
this
beer
in
a
pinch
its
probably
not
a
fav
style
of
mine
but
if
there
was
nothing
else
left
id
take
it
overall
this
is
an
outstanding
beer
i
would
consider
a
as
great
example
of
its
style
overall
its
a
good
example
of
a
dunkel
weissen
smooth
flavors
nothing
too
odd
o
i
see
this
brew
sitting
in
the
holster
of
a
pool
float
with
me
on
it
in
my
future
o
very
sessionable
beer
with
heaps
on
offer
d
such
a
refreshing
beer
i
could
drink
this
all
dayespecially
on
a
hot
summers
day
another
stellar
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
o
a
classic
rendition
of
the
style
with
all
of
the
nutty
banana
bread
notes
and
smooth
easytodrink
feel
man
weihenstephaner
nails
wheats
flavorful
without
being
too
strong
well
balanced
very
drinkable
id
go
for
it
again
without
question
d
4
5
given
the
right
time
and
place
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
it
has
a
great
balance
of
tasty
flavors
and
goes
down
easily
it
really
isnt
heavy
either
granted
i
wasnt
as
blown
away
by
this
as
i
was
by
the
brewerys
regular
hefeweizen
but
thats
probably
because
the
bar
had
been
set
so
high
ill
definitely
buy
again
and
recommend
overall
first
dunkelweizen
ive
had
and
i
must
say
i
like
it
go
find
it
if
you
can
and
give
it
a
go
with
the
hot
weather
coming
notes
very
good
beer
if
you
can
get
it
then
please
dont
hesitate
highly
drinkable
and
plenty
refreshing
overall
one
of
the
best
dunkleweizens
available
d
good
beer
good
dunkel
weiss
worthy
of
another
round
bier
this
is
my
favorite
so
far
from
weihenstephaner
and
in
my
top
3
beers
overall
i
have
only
tried
3
of
theyre
beers
so
far
hefeweizen
hefeweizen
dunkel
and
theyre
original
premium
this
beer
is
simply
amazing
it
renders
me
speechless
if
you
are
a
true
hefeweizen
fan
you
cannot
go
through
life
without
trying
this
awesome
beer
as
the
other
weihenstephaner
styles
are
also
exceptionally
tasty
kristal
and
wheat
i
recommend
having
one
of
each
if
youre
having
this
for
the
1st
time
having
more
than
3
of
the
dunkels
starts
to
put
you
into
that
morphinelike
stupor
though
so
i
would
recommend
switching
to
another
style
at
that
point
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
a
nicely
balanced
dark
wheat
beer
in
the
end
theres
something
to
be
said
for
old
world
subtlety
when
it
deems
to
come
along
however
that
bananayeast
thing
does
grow
a
bit
stale
sooner
rather
than
later
so
i
cant
really
imagine
having
more
than
one
serving
of
this
at
a
time
o
overall
a
very
tasty
dunkelweizen
and
a
top
notch
sample
of
the
style
the
flavours
are
complex
but
not
overwhelming
making
it
easily
sessionable
would
be
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
will
certainly
be
picking
this
one
up
again
o
an
easy
drinker
to
be
sure
even
if
im
not
enjoying
this
one
quite
as
much
as
i
thought
i
would
after
the
hefeweizen
still
a
good
beer
and
worth
a
try
maybe
it
will
be
even
more
to
your
taste
than
the
ordinary
one
a
slight
bit
heavy
on
the
carbonation
but
a
nice
wheat
beer
and
drinkable
if
a
bit
heavy
d
i
wish
i
could
try
everything
these
guys
had
to
offer
just
a
fantastic
dunkelweizen
food
match
same
as
the
hefeweissbier
nuff
said
the
complex
flavors
make
this
an
excellent
dinner
beer
and
paired
with
the
perfect
course
id
say
this
is
a
good
beer
i
wouldnt
stick
with
it
all
night
a
pleasure
to
drink
d
the
bready
bitterness
and
clove
spice
hold
this
back
a
little
but
it
is
still
terrific
comes
across
a
bit
mild
and
watery
to
me
perhaps
its
bolder
on
its
local
turf
but
this
imported
bottle
version
leaves
me
wanting
very
drinkable
recommended
notes
outstanding
this
beer
is
a
work
of
wheat
beer
art
drinkability
would
rather
have
the
regular
hefeweissbier
as
it
doesnt
offer
as
much
complexity
overall
it
is
clear
why
this
is
a
top
german
beer
good
contrast
to
the
hefeweizen
im
going
to
be
looking
for
more
dunkelweizens
as
i
find
the
style
very
interesting
16
9oz
brown
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
salem
pours
a
murky
brownred
body
with
over
an
inch
of
khakicolored
head
smells
fruity
with
ripe
banana
date
and
nut
tastes
like
banana
nut
spice
caramel
toffee
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
in
the
background
ample
carbonation
compliments
a
medium
to
full
body
to
make
this
a
superdrinkable
supercomplex
beer
im
beyond
impressed
very
smooth
and
balanced
very
drinkable
top
quality
refreshing
very
enjoyable
beer
allaround
db
certainly
a
version
of
their
classic
beer
with
just
a
bit
of
darkness
in
the
way
of
malt
and
fruit
i
just
love
the
weihenstephaner
yeast
profile
this
beer
could
use
a
bit
more
body
and
maybe
a
bit
less
sweetness
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
a
threefinger
off
white
head
great
lacing
and
retention
throughout
aroma
of
belgian
yeast
bread
and
sweet
malt
big
yeasty
and
bready
flavor
up
front
nice
belgian
yeast
flavor
a
bit
of
banana
clove
and
spice
before
a
bready
sweet
malt
some
dark
fruits
as
well
nice
sweetness
throughout
drinkability
it
was
hard
to
say
no
to
a
second
one
definitely
will
have
the
scond
one
next
time
superb
glass
of
beer
drinkability
not
as
nice
as
the
hefeweizen
by
this
brewer
but
a
great
beer
nonetheless
a
great
style
representative
i
guess
i
just
prefer
the
hefe
d
i
picked
the
right
dunkelweizen
for
my
first
this
beer
is
very
good
and
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
really
just
nitpicking
here
bias
derived
from
my
taste
for
fullerbodied
amer
ales
yeah
take
only
a
small
fraction
of
a
volume
off
the
carbonation
and
id
dub
this
perfect
i
think
ill
achieve
nirvana
with
this
from
draft
well
see
d
yes
more
d
very
drinkable
could
drink
a
couple
bottles
d
i
could
have
this
anytime
of
year
though
i
prefer
it
during
the
colder
months
easily
my
favorite
dunkel
which
should
be
no
surprise
considering
its
ranks
among
the
style
drinkability
very
good
really
cant
go
wrong
with
this
company
d
easier
to
down
than
your
normal
dunkelweiss
quite
refreshing
wish
i
had
another
a
profoundly
enjoyable
brew
very
good
drink
for
a
hefewish
she
came
in
6ers
carbonation
is
intense
at
first
but
softens
quickly
creaminess
again
is
awesome
reminds
me
of
a
milkshake
somehow
fantastic
beer
arguably
better
than
the
regular
hefeweissbier
they
make
traded
some
esters
for
some
warmer
flavors
dweihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
the
dunkel
is
expceptional
everytime
i
make
a
trip
to
the
distributor
i
always
pick
up
atleast
45
bottles
of
the
dunkel
and
korbinian
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
wellbalanced
flavours
with
a
wellmeasured
mildness
that
gives
you
no
choice
but
to
drink
more
is
there
nothing
that
weihenstephaner
can
do
wrong
well
constructed
and
a
reasonable
gravity
to
accompany
a
rich
meat
and
potatoes
dinner
drinkabilitywow
awesome
a
good
dark
hefe
nicely
flavored
nothing
overdone
generous
carbonation
and
flavors
make
this
a
solid
brew
drinkability
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
that
makes
you
want
more
never
have
had
this
dunkel
so
i
scooped
it
up
for
the
pleasure
pours
dark
amberlight
brown
very
cloudy
with
a
huge
airy
white
head
not
quite
as
dark
as
i
was
hoping
for
big
banana
esters
slight
clove
a
toastiness
of
malt
and
some
wheat
the
taste
is
very
pleasant
a
bit
much
on
the
banana
but
the
feel
is
light
and
fun
with
a
bunch
of
stuff
going
on
from
the
yeast
and
grains
tastes
like
a
decoction
with
either
or
munich
malt
in
addition
to
the
wheat
i
cant
point
it
exactly
finishes
easy
an
excellent
drink
one
i
will
certainly
go
back
to
in
the
future
d
this
beer
is
highly
drinkable
a
nice
flavor
the
only
fault
i
can
find
with
this
beer
is
the
dryness
that
it
leaves
in
the
mouth
otherwise
it
is
an
excellent
beer
another
superb
offering
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
they
obviously
know
what
theyre
doing
d
very
nice
a
beer
that
tastes
effortless
but
i
am
sure
it
is
anything
but
a
great
beer
to
spend
a
day
drinking
d
when
i
get
the
chance
im
buying
a
months
worth
of
this
stuff
merry
christmas
to
me
i
know
it
is
a
dunkelweizen
but
i
really
struggle
to
separate
the
flavor
profile
of
this
from
the
regular
version
maybe
its
just
me
however
it
is
one
dang
tasty
beer
there
are
few
beers
that
are
going
to
go
down
easier
than
this
its
great
just
holding
it
in
the
mouth
and
savoring
it
i
tried
this
out
of
curiosity
but
would
never
buy
it
again
d
a
very
good
beer
hurt
by
its
high
carbonation
this
was
probably
the
best
tasting
dunkelweizen
ive
had
and
it
looked
great
as
well
would
certainly
have
again
but
i
think
if
it
was
less
carbonated
it
could
be
even
better
d
this
is
one
very
delicious
dunkel
id
love
to
find
this
on
tap
someday
or
pair
it
with
some
grilled
brats
and
sauerkraut
has
all
the
exceptional
quality
of
its
regular
brother
with
a
bit
more
character
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
and
still
wish
for
just
one
more
simply
outstanding
overall
solid
beer
but
had
this
back
to
back
with
ayingers
dunkeweizen
and
i
thought
that
one
was
slightly
better
d
the
glass
begs
to
be
picked
back
up
constantly
d
if
i
had
an
endless
supply
of
this
i
wouldnt
have
a
job
because
i
would
be
too
drunk
due
to
constantly
drinking
this
i
dont
know
if
i
could
drink
this
on
a
100
degree
day
but
any
other
time
i
would
whenever
i
see
this
on
a
shelf
at
a
store
ill
be
picking
it
up
and
i
suggest
you
do
the
same
outstanding
a
little
over
a
pint
bottle
was
gone
before
i
even
had
time
to
finish
all
of
my
notes
for
this
review
drinkability
this
beer
was
half
gone
before
i
even
knew
it
goes
down
so
easy
and
is
such
a
delight
to
drink
i
wont
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
i
like
it
better
than
the
hefeweissbier
but
i
would
not
be
disappointed
if
this
was
all
i
had
on
me
conclusion
a
triumph
there
is
little
doubt
that
weihenstephaner
has
mastered
the
art
of
the
classic
styles
of
german
wheat
beers
i
love
this
style
of
beer
and
i
can
find
no
major
faults
with
this
example
of
the
style
drink
it
d
easy
drinking
very
clean
good
beer
and
well
put
together
this
brewery
has
to
be
the
finest
in
the
world
i
know
its
the
oldest
since
1050
drinkability
highly
drinkable
nice
depth
of
flavor
helps
make
this
a
great
session
beer
after
i
had
tried
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
figured
i
had
to
try
this
i
was
in
germany
a
few
years
ago
and
it
was
then
that
i
decided
this
was
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
beer
pours
a
little
lighter
than
i
expected
it
was
a
cloudy
auburn
color
with
a
wonderfully
tall
offwhite
head
the
smell
was
of
clove
and
wheat
when
i
went
for
my
first
taste
i
initially
got
a
little
bit
of
foam
on
my
nose
definitely
a
good
sign
great
head
retention
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
but
also
brought
out
a
nuttiness
or
a
dark
fruitiness
of
some
sort
there
is
also
just
a
slight
bit
of
a
roasted
flavor
to
this
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
perfect
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
the
perfect
embodiment
of
the
style
although
this
was
an
old
bottle
it
really
held
up
great
this
is
easily
my
favorite
wheat
beer
i
cant
wait
to
find
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
stuff
the
2
40
i
paid
for
this
1
pt
bottle
is
money
well
spent
next
time
im
buying
all
of
them
from
the
shelf
d
very
high
low
abv
and
wonderful
taste
make
me
wish
i
had
more
than
one
md
thinner
body
than
i
was
expecting
but
great
carbonation
for
the
style
nice
flavor
profile
and
yeast
flavors
makes
it
real
easy
to
drink
and
searching
for
other
flavors
finishes
with
a
nice
malty
sugar
sweetness
overall
excellent
beer
overall
and
a
nearperfect
example
of
a
dunkelweizen
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
d
a
good
dunkel
not
quite
up
to
par
with
their
superb
hefe
but
its
a
good
one
when
looking
for
something
in
the
style
d
one
is
enough
after
reading
reviews
i
wonder
how
fresh
my
sample
is
because
it
sounds
far
better
by
other
palates
i
picked
this
up
in
a
500ml
bottle
and
poured
it
into
a
wheat
glass
it
poured
out
with
a
deep
woody
mahogany
color
with
plenty
of
excited
bubble
racing
to
the
top
forming
a
dull
brownwhite
head
that
lingers
throughout
i
smell
fruity
esters
that
i
cant
put
a
finger
on
and
banana
later
in
the
sniff
i
pick
up
bread
yeast
and
grain
a
fine
bouquet
very
bready
banana
apricot
and
a
hint
of
cherry
nice
mild
hop
drying
effect
that
balances
off
the
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
wet
up
front
drying
in
the
back
and
medium
overall
carbonation
is
prickly
and
burpy
this
beer
goes
down
like
nectar
with
a
wanting
for
more
i
can
see
myself
in
a
bar
in
germany
drinking
the
day
away
with
this
beer
outstanding
beer
one
of
the
best
in
its
style
hands
down
age
has
not
affected
this
beer
it
is
the
king
of
beers
for
this
style
and
i
will
revisit
it
soon
the
most
flavorful
beer
ive
ever
had
under
6
and
not
a
sour
but
maybe
only
one
ive
had
this
beer
in
the
past
and
remember
liking
it
now
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
review
it
the
appearance
is
of
a
cloudy
dirty
brown
color
that
is
to
be
associated
with
the
dunkelweizen
this
was
also
given
to
me
with
two
fingers
of
very
pillowy
head
the
smell
is
of
the
traditional
belgian
yeasts
which
include
the
heavy
smells
of
banana
and
clove
in
addition
there
were
aromas
of
orange
zest
and
the
overall
bready
malt
aroma
the
taste
was
strongly
of
the
banana
clove
and
citrus
most
closely
associated
with
orange
there
were
also
hints
of
rock
candy
and
brown
sugar
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
delicious
as
only
a
good
weiss
bier
should
be
this
was
quite
drinkable
and
very
pleasant
i
recommend
having
this
if
given
the
opportunity
d
this
is
a
very
nice
dunkel
the
complexity
of
flavor
and
low
abv
make
it
an
easy
drinker
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
was
not
a
big
fan
of
their
lighter
hefe
but
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
delicious
supremely
drinkable
dunkelweizen
highly
recommended
especially
for
the
low
low
price
tag
i
have
been
on
a
us
beer
kick
for
the
last
few
years
but
this
may
have
launched
me
back
over
the
pond
and
away
from
ipas
i
will
def
be
picking
more
of
this
up
d
very
drinkable
very
very
drinkable
id
buy
a
6
pack
in
a
heartbeat
notes
i
am
on
a
dunkelweizen
push
right
now
aventinus
on
tap
was
probably
my
favorite
because
of
its
darker
fruit
tones
the
moosbacker
was
also
a
favorite
because
it
shared
the
dark
fruit
character
as
far
as
hitting
the
mark
for
a
catagory
this
beer
and
brewery
does
it
very
well
this
disappeared
before
i
knew
what
happened
to
it
so
drinkable
a
wonderful
beer
pours
a
burnt
orange
with
a
head
that
looks
like
a
dollup
of
vanilla
ice
cream
just
looks
fantastic
zesty
banana
bread
on
the
smell
citrus
spices
banana
yeast
and
wheat
bread
with
a
hint
of
roastiness
towards
the
end
creamy
mouthfeel
mmm
this
is
a
good
beer
a
great
dunkelweizen
from
an
exceptional
german
brewery
one
of
the
best
mouthfeeldrinkability
this
beer
has
an
awesome
soft
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
very
fine
and
makes
the
beer
refreshing
its
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
that
i
am
very
impressed
with
very
enjoyable
dunkle
with
some
aspects
i
dont
really
love
like
the
root
beer
flavor
and
slight
metallic
edge
otherwise
a
really
good
brew
d
u
can
session
plenty
of
this
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
this
beer
has
plenty
of
conventional
flavor
and
aroma
character
although
the
beer
is
on
the
lighter
side
the
flavors
are
not
as
one
would
say
dont
judge
a
book
buy
its
cover
served
september
4
2010
this
reminds
me
of
that
movie
beerfest
when
the
guys
brew
the
secret
recipe
and
take
one
sip
and
start
crying
the
discussion
of
wanting
to
put
ones
dick
in
it
and
vice
versa
is
fully
realized
after
the
first
sip
clean
flavorful
malty
with
traces
of
banana
and
vanilla
this
beer
has
it
all
the
first
time
i
tried
this
was
at
schnitzleplatz
in
addison
il
i
drank
a
2
litre
das
boot
of
it
and
every
drop
went
down
smooth
those
bavarians
know
their
beer
but
what
else
can
be
expected
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
drink
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
is
the
best
one
that
i
have
had
so
far
this
is
one
of
my
new
alltime
favorites
drink
up
mouthfeeldrinkability
typical
wheat
beer
easy
going
down
be
careful
however
they
almost
go
down
too
easily
nice
body
refreshing
d
for
me
its
probably
limited
to
12
22ounce
bottles
nice
somewhat
muddy
and
less
defined
than
i
would
prefer
though
the
excitement
wears
off
after
a
few
might
go
nicely
with
a
grilled
steak
or
with
a
pasta
dish
or
a
pork
with
gravy
dish
fabulously
drinkable
im
ashamed
that
i
only
picked
up
one
as
i
forgot
how
good
these
are
a
very
tasty
beer
one
that
i
could
drink
all
night
this
is
a
style
that
is
underrepresented
at
my
local
beer
buying
venues
so
i
think
ill
be
buying
this
again
this
beer
was
okay
but
not
outstanding
i
would
not
mind
drinking
this
again
as
it
is
worth
revisiting
i
thought
it
was
a
step
up
from
julius
echter
hefeweissbier
dunkel
a
light
brown
colored
brew
with
a
good
frothy
head
and
nice
carbonation
mild
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
sweet
roasty
malts
not
as
spiced
or
banana
as
other
german
dunkelweizens
a
good
drinking
brew
but
perhaps
a
bit
overrated
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
very
light
and
nuanced
different
from
what
i
expect
from
the
style
interesting
take
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
a
very
delicate
ordeal
this
is
a
excellent
be
with
a
lot
of
subtleties
the
pour
is
a
murky
thin
brownish
color
with
a
nose
that
has
the
quality
so
several
dukelweizen
at
once
this
is
sour
apple
floral
smoke
and
wheat
the
palate
expands
to
something
mildly
sweet
in
the
face
of
other
dunkel
hefs
with
a
very
mild
molasses
sweet
and
a
wheat
grit
dry
feeling
of
clove
lots
of
apple
and
a
volume
that
doesnt
hang
around
on
the
tongue
for
long
because
of
the
crispness
and
mild
floral
soapiness
great
mix
of
flavors
and
qualities
a
must
for
fans
i
am
open
to
suggestions
on
this
drinkablility
im
sure
the
what
lovers
find
it
great
but
i
just
cant
go
over
3
5
and
for
me
that
is
generous
d
i
can
drink
this
any
time
any
place
and
it
brings
me
right
back
to
the
place
that
i
first
had
it
in
a
pizza
house
in
germany
excellent
drinkability
d
weihenstephaner
is
another
brewery
that
doesnt
seem
to
make
a
bad
beer
a
solid
dunkel
that
i
would
pick
up
again
gorgeous
color
and
a
whipped
cream
cap
really
pleasing
aroma
low
on
banana
and
high
on
a
sharp
sour
fruit
flavor
flavor
is
awesome
this
is
my
kind
of
dunkel
good
soft
wheat
and
a
sharp
cut
of
sour
fruit
high
level
of
carbonation
feels
nice
and
the
body
feels
light
and
airy
this
is
really
good
beer
hint
of
berry
and
slight
mineral
love
it
i
overlooked
this
beer
for
my
whole
drinking
career
and
by
doing
so
have
neglected
a
truly
exceptional
beer
out
of
a
bomber
this
beer
was
a
cloudy
copper
color
with
lots
of
rising
carbonation
the
one
finger
of
light
khaki
colored
head
displayed
very
good
retention
and
left
lacing
in
bands
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
butterscotch
candi
sugar
and
some
hints
of
dark
fruits
the
flavors
were
just
like
the
aroma
with
a
pleasant
sweetness
from
the
malts
balanced
by
a
good
note
of
spicy
hoppy
bitterness
that
seemed
to
blossom
as
the
beer
warmed
up
i
also
tasted
cloves
lots
of
wheat
and
some
banana
notes
from
the
yeast
complex
and
enjoyable
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
the
body
medium
but
the
carbonation
just
a
touch
too
high
for
my
liking
drinkability
very
flavorful
palatable
easy
drinking
draft
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
turbid
brownishamber
with
a
huge
frothy
cap
cocoa
caramelized
banana
and
clove
aroma
a
bit
like
fried
and
spiced
bananas
light
on
the
tongue
but
very
flavorful
reminiscent
of
chocolate
covered
bananas
and
grandmas
spice
rack
this
is
on
the
dry
side
though
the
flavors
suggest
dessert
ultimately
this
is
to
the
beers
benefit
it
never
becomes
cloying
spicy
peppery
finish
with
lingering
clove
a
stellar
example
of
the
style
one
of
the
best
dunkel
weizen
i
ever
had
reviewed
from
my
notes
the
beer
is
a
muddy
brown
liquid
it
has
a
thin
offwhite
foam
head
the
beer
is
opaque
but
i
can
still
see
some
carbonation
bubbles
clinging
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
and
rising
within
there
are
a
number
of
aromas
coming
from
this
beer
i
can
smell
clove
banana
and
a
slight
sweetness
reminiscent
of
brown
sugar
it
tastes
of
musty
yeast
like
a
weissebier
should
there
is
lots
of
banana
and
some
clove
in
the
flavor
the
finish
has
a
bit
of
peppery
spice
to
it
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
the
coating
is
very
good
and
it
contains
some
sweetness
the
pepper
in
the
finish
provides
a
bit
of
a
bite
but
otherwise
it
finishes
cleanly
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
have
a
few
of
these
it
is
a
perfect
beverage
for
the
outdoor
deck
here
at
my
favorite
bier
garden
i
tried
this
beer
on
november
5
2009
at
smokeless
joes
in
toronto
ontario
canada
the
beer
poured
a
dark
brown
colour
with
golden
highlights
and
1
head
that
lasted
the
aroma
was
wheat
malt
cloves
and
some
yeast
the
mouthfeel
was
mediumbodied
and
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
wheat
malt
cloves
some
gingerlike
flavours
and
a
bitter
finish
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
and
everything
a
good
dunkelweizen
should
be
this
will
definately
find
its
way
into
my
normal
rotation
nice
little
hefeweizen
with
added
roast
and
dark
toffee
tones
i
think
i
like
this
better
than
their
helles
hefe
d
another
great
beer
from
weihenstephanen
low
abv
and
very
drinkable
i
could
do
another
one
of
these
with
no
problem
md
average
body
great
drinkability
i
could
easily
drink
a
couple
of
these
on
a
cool
summer
evening
and
it
wouldnt
kill
the
wallet
decent
price
near
me
for
the
quality
d
im
very
impressed
with
this
beer
a
delicious
supremely
drinkable
dunkelweizen
that
should
have
nearuniversal
appeal
in
many
ways
this
drinks
like
a
cross
between
a
dubbel
and
a
hefeweizen
and
in
this
case
the
result
is
excellent
highly
recommended
d
so
good
and
refreshing
this
is
light
but
with
a
rich
taste
i
could
drink
many
of
these
at
any
time
of
year
overall
a
great
beer
d
filling
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
would
easily
be
able
to
sit
down
with
some
friends
in
a
gasthaus
and
order
a
few
with
some
good
sausages
or
schnitzel
nice
beer
and
im
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
wheats
at
all
will
need
to
revisit
this
one
pours
a
threefinger
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
leaving
no
lace
good
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
hazy
light
amber
color
no
yeast
settling
out
nose
is
mostly
yeast
and
some
malt
flavor
is
dominated
by
the
yeast
some
wheat
sweet
yeasty
finish
not
nearly
as
good
as
when
i
had
it
7
years
ago
3
25
for
a
500ml
bottle
from
colonial
spirits
acton
ma
drinkability
could
drink
this
all
day
long
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
there
is
a
perfect
beer
this
is
it
from
first
opening
the
bottle
through
the
pour
and
right
to
the
finish
this
beer
is
superb
d
this
is
a
exelent
choise
for
a
session
beer
i
could
drink
4
of
this
one
with
no
problem
the
best
dunkel
weissen
that
i
have
tried
if
you
like
dark
hefeweissbeirs
this
is
an
excellent
choice
i
will
never
turn
one
of
these
down
a
prime
candidate
for
a
session
beer
seems
to
fit
the
style
well
and
while
its
pretty
good
it
didnt
blow
me
away
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
this
again
but
id
recommend
it
to
someone
looking
for
a
good
wheat
beer
o
just
not
as
much
flavor
as
the
blond
a
nice
beer
but
ill
stick
to
the
blond
for
hefeweiss
notes
creamy
mouthfeel
and
a
beer
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
d
just
a
great
beer
i
believe
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
more
then
the
hefe
actually
nuanced
flavor
but
better
for
it
understated
malts
so
missing
a
lot
of
the
fruit
note
signposting
of
a
weizen
bizarrely
i
keep
thinking
of
the
yeast
action
that
orval
brings
i
guess
thats
a
compliment
ah
a
good
old
german
brew
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
tp
the
smell
reminds
me
of
the
old
hungry
sailor
in
the
grove
beer
and
cloves
smell
also
has
hints
of
banana
spot
on
for
a
dunkelweizen
pouring
into
a
pils
glass
yields
a
cloudy
light
brown
with
a
big
two
finger
off
white
head
made
up
of
multi
sized
bubbles
taste
is
more
banana
almost
banana
flambe
banana
sweetness
and
alcohol
the
only
bitterness
there
is
is
right
at
the
end
of
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
good
carbonation
brings
out
the
flavor
overall
a
great
example
of
the
style
but
much
too
sweet
for
my
tastes
thus
a
lower
drinkability
rating
dthis
has
a
good
taste
but
it
is
a
little
thin
and
watered
down
good
flavors
for
the
dunkelweizen
and
very
easy
to
drink
very
easy
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
well
balanced
between
refreshing
and
dry
clean
and
complete
drinkability
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
more
roasted
and
banana
breadlike
making
this
beer
a
more
suitable
alternative
to
the
hefeweizenss
during
the
winter
time
however
this
was
not
the
case
as
the
extremely
potent
apple
flavors
made
this
beer
more
like
an
apple
juice
brew
than
anything
else
contrary
to
my
predispositions
this
would
make
a
lovely
summer
beer
especially
for
those
times
when
you
feel
like
a
kid
and
need
your
sippy
cup
of
apple
juice
the
palate
opens
light
and
airy
with
the
clovelike
spice
quite
dominant
with
some
banana
too
not
as
balanced
as
the
nose
this
still
tastes
excellent
a
definite
cocoa
presence
is
noted
and
theres
a
touch
of
caramel
and
a
moderate
toasted
whole
wheat
bread
character
medium
in
body
with
high
carbonation
this
beer
dries
on
the
finish
leaving
a
strong
clove
character
along
with
some
banana
thoroughly
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
pick
this
over
their
regular
hefeweissbier
but
thats
hardly
a
surprise
d
the
beer
goes
down
smooth
and
is
quite
thirst
quenching
its
not
as
delightfully
quaffable
as
its
traditional
wheat
siblings
but
makes
up
for
it
with
loads
more
complexity
drinkability
great
smell
and
mouthfeel
but
the
taste
doesnt
quite
match
id
be
happy
to
drink
it
again
though
d
great
drinkability
i
think
i
like
the
regular
hefeweissbier
better
but
this
is
still
a
great
brew
drinkability
excellent
beer
i
could
certainly
get
this
again
and
drink
it
many
times
it
could
be
a
very
good
session
beer
as
well
a
really
good
classic
beer
from
germany
a
really
drinkable
beer
but
it
doesnt
make
me
crave
it
as
much
as
the
normal
hefe
d
extremely
drinkable
i
could
down
3
or
more
pints
of
this
delicious
brew
you
got
to
like
the
clovespice
flavors
to
enjoy
this
beer
because
it
has
allot
of
it
but
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
and
im
excited
to
try
this
breweries
other
beers
very
refreshing
on
a
warm
day
cheers
notes
really
nice
beer
good
mix
of
classical
hefewizen
flavors
and
sweet
dark
flavors
ill
mention
it
for
one
more
time
really
reminiscent
of
a
banana
bread
french
toast
a
touch
sweet
but
a
really
enjoyable
beer
im
not
sure
if
it
is
better
than
the
original
hefewizen
rather
it
is
just
a
different
beer
that
i
would
crave
at
a
different
time
for
different
reasons
pours
a
very
cloudy
dark
brown
color
body
big
foamy
offwhite
head
somewhat
lasting
decent
lacing
very
fruity
aroma
lots
of
banana
and
fruit
like
strawberries
dry
somewhat
spicy
too
maybe
clove
not
overpowering
nice
thick
mouthfeel
almost
like
drinking
thick
syrup
very
thick
some
flavor
but
not
very
much
almost
a
chemical
taste
to
it
plastic
or
something
warming
up
a
bit
more
more
dark
fruit
like
grape
raisin
not
very
complex
a
flavor
light
better
as
it
warms
d
anyone
who
doesnt
get
their
regular
fix
of
weihenstephaner
brews
is
a
nuts
b
missing
out
on
great
beer
c
getting
sheisted
there
is
no
greater
value
than
weihenstephaner
slightly
sweet
toasty
caramel
bounces
in
and
out
of
the
flavor
into
the
finish
and
fade
soft
with
subtle
spice

to
compliment
the
malt
fantastic
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
creamy

this
might
be
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
tried
to
date
yellowbrown

a
creamy
foamy

recedes
to
1cm

powerful
cloves
and
a
hint
of

than
the

fantastic
classic
dunkelweizen
weihenstephaner
hefe
weissbier
dunkel
is
a
delicious
dunkel
weizen
this
dunkel
is
another
stellar
brew
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewer
notes
a
very
nice
dark
wheat
brew
that
is
one
of
the
best
from
the
typical
german
offerings
for
this
style
drinkability
very
good
for
the
style
love
the
mix
of
caramel
and
wheat
not
the
most
complex
beer
i
have
had
but
a
really
good
one
i
could
have
several
of
these
d
easy
to
drink
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
none
the
less
its
a
good
price
for
what
it
delivers
one
to
try
out
for
sure
great
stuff
definitely
worth
trying
drinkability
being
a
dunkelweissen
this
one
has
a
little
more
substance
than
hefeweissens
i
like
it
better
for
cold
weather
than
the
hefes
as
tasty
a
beer
as
i
have
ever
quaffed
d
a
wonderful
brew
and
definitely
something
ill
pick
up
more
often
if
i
see
it
bottle
from
lcbo
brown
pour
with
generous
white
head
roasted
wheat
and
clove
aroma
bananas
wheaty
flavor
quite
acetic
with
some
cloves
good
palate
i
had
low
expectations
for
this
beer
but
its
on
equilibrium
and
quite
enjoyable
highly
drinkable
d
its
crazy
that
a
beer
this
good
is
also
such
an
incredibly
cheap
buy
if
you
only
have
a
10
bill
in
your
wallet
pick
up
three
of
these
and
call
it
a
night
yup
another
incredible
beer
from
weihenstephan
who
make
many
of
my
favorite
beers
goes
down
easy
and
is
so
well
balanced
just
about
flawless
it
must
be
noted
i
was
given
this
as
a
gift
the
best
before
date
was
approximately
6
months
away
but
my
experience
with
the
style
is
freshest
is
best
and
seeing
as
it
was
part
of
a
gift
pack
i
wonder
if
i
would
enjoy
this
more
if
i
drank
one
closer
to
bottling
a
stellar
dunkelweizen
i
will
be
seeking
this
out
in
the
future
its
tremendously
drinkable
with
enough
layers
of
complexity
to
be
a
truly
contemplative
brew
d
a
very
enjoyable
rich
beer
that
is
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
beer
at
this
abv
still
this
is
one
of
the
best
german
beers
i
have
ever
had
if
you
have
not
tried
this
beer
before
you
really
owe
it
to
yourself
to
relax
and
enjoy
a
glass
this
is
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
recent
memory
with
little
doubt
a
big
thank
you
adil
for
this
gem
i
only
wish
this
was
available
where
i
live
it
would
be
in
my
regular
rotation
all
year
round
this
is
a
must
try
for
any
beer
lover
and
for
the
style
its
awesome
you
could
spend
a
lot
of
time
and
money
searching
for
a
better
one
and
may
not
find
it
d
as
before
very
crisp
would
definitely
have
another
perhaps
two
or
three
this
is
probably
my
least
favorite
style
of
beers
which
is
why
its
the
90th
style
ive
reviewed
so
far
i
dont
buy
these
often
because
i
just
dont
like
them
but
i
do
like
weihenstephaner
and
hope
they
dont
let
me
down
with
my
least
favorite
style
pours
a
hazy
russet
brown
color
with
a
large
white
head
and
decent
lacing
lots
of
carbonation
bubbles
aroma
of
wheat
light
banana
and
slightly
flowery
taste
is
wheaty
a
strange
minty
flavor
at
first
gives
way
to
some
sugary
sweetness
and
another
odd
anise
flavor
on
the
finish
yeasty
medium
body
carbonation
is
good
and
tingly
i
still
dont
get
this
style
i
think
this
would
be
a
top
notch
brew
if
this
your
thing
but
its
certainly
not
mine
served
in
a
weihenstephaner
weiss
glass
at
stuff
yer
face
in
new
brunswick
nj
first
i
loved
the
glass
and
need
to
track
one
down
very
cloudy
malt
brown
color
with
a
decent
head
and
nice
lacing
great
wheatbready
aroma
i
love
this
taste
malty
and
wheat
sweet
but
not
overly
so
very
refreshing
but
filling
too
this
is
what
all
other
dunkles
should
be
judged
by
this
is
a
very
nice
one
and
a
great
example
of
what
a
dunkelweizen
is
essentially
a
dark
maltier
hefe
o
a
truly
worldclass
beer
my
favorite
wheat
favorite
of
the
style
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
of
all
time
overall
an
enjoyable
quaff
generous
foamy
beige
head
poured
carefully
into
its
own
glass
this
dunkel
is
medium
brown
transluscent
with
lots
of
miniscule
bubble
streams
drifting
upwards
very
good
retention
creamy
sheets
of
lace
and
lots
of
staying
power
carbonationwise
the
aroma
of
a
wheat
beer
upfront
lightly
spiced
banana
and
vanilla
fudge
nose
taste
has
a
mild
hop
presence
a
touch
fruity
but
with
nice
balance
there
are
hints
of
allspice
clove
molasses
smooth
and
creamy
texture
in
the
mouth
nice
and
even
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
earthy
and
detracts
marginally
from
an
otherwise
exemplary
beer
experience
clearly
a
thousand
years
of
brewing
has
perfected
the
strength
flavour
and
mouthfeel
because
this
just
goes
down
in
gulps
bravo
overall
an
excellent
beer
and
one
im
more
than
glad
i
picked
up
while
the
lcbo
had
it
in
supply
this
beer
marks
the
first
a
that
ive
given
a
beer
while
on
this
site
not
that
it
means
much
but
it
says
something
to
me
the
addition
of
toasted
malt
to
the
flavours
of
an
excellent
hefe
really
made
this
beer
stand
out
this
one
leaves
me
looking
forward
to
trying
their
original
hefeweizen
fingers
crossed
that
it
will
come
around
here
soon
highly
highly
recommended
nicely
balanced
beer
that
is
drinkable
with
a
head
that
lasted
till
the
last
sip
it
went
well
with
pan
seared
yellowfin
tuna
cant
wait
to
have
another
extremely
drinkable
for
a
meal
of
a
beer
drinkability
a
very
easydrinking
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
flavor
body
and
carbonation
i
could
easily
drink
this
for
a
long
long
time
its
very
drinkable
but
not
all
that
interesting
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
but
wont
be
actively
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
i
expected
a
bit
more
of
a
complex
taste
final
thoughts
this
beer
deserves
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
dark
wheat
beer
pile
and
i
think
with
a
bit
more
roasting
of
the
malt
and
some
minor
tweaks
it
would
be
perfect
excellent
desert
beer
or
perfect
with
sweet
foods
i
cannot
recommend
it
enough
if
you
are
reading
this
go
buy
a
bottle
right
now
d
easy
drinker
again
i
could
have
more
than
one
very
well
balance
and
nothing
throws
you
off
a
nice
beer
pours
a
murky
caramel
color
with
a
voluminous
fluffy
offwhite
head
aroma
is
bread
crusts
bananas
vanilla
and
clove
flavor
is
similar
bready
with
a
strong
banana
note
and
just
enough
clove
mouthfeel
is
silky
and
smooth
another
wellcrafted
weihenstephaner
beer
d
highly
highly
drinkable
a
great
session
beer
would
love
to
have
this
fresh
from
the
brewery
excellent
example
of
style
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
caramel
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
banana
bread
with
some
spices
taste
is
also
of
banana
bread
with
some
cloves
and
spices
quite
tasty
feels
creamy
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
brew
this
beer
is
slightly
heavier
in
my
opinion
than
the
hefeweizen
still
a
stand
up
beer
more
sweetness
beer
is
still
wet
and
not
dry
at
all
finishes
nicely
not
as
high
drinkability
as
the
hefe
but
still
a
stand
up
beer
mouthfeel
is
heavier
than
i
would
like
but
thats
why
its
a
dunkel
the
pour
is
a
darker
amber
but
also
rather
cloudy
with
about
an
inch
of
puffy
beige
head
that
settles
down
after
a
few
moments
my
first
sensation
on
the
nose
is
of
cloves
coriander
and
malts
with
fresher
eurohops
pulling
up
the
rear
the
mouthfeel
is
bold
and
creamy
cloves
wheat
and
something
akin
to
allspice
mingle
together
in
the
taste
this
is
not
bitter
at
all
it
is
very
mild
and
mellow
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
likeable
generally
easy
to
handle
dark
beer
from
a
technical
perspective
this
is
a
solid
dunkelweizen
as
the
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
world
class
but
the
aromas
and
flavours
leave
much
to
be
desired
with
a
bit
more
boldness
in
those
areas
this
would
be
a
kickass
brew
cloudy
brown
with
a
huge
creamy
head
of
tan
foam
excellent
lacing
big
wheatybananaearthy
aroma
with
some
light
clove
smooth
as
silk
body
not
an
overly
dark
roasty
flavour
maybe
a
hint
but
mostly
a
bananaclove
wheatiness
with
a
hint
of
anise
light
fruitiness
and
a
mild
bitterness
round
out
the
flavours
very
nice
a
great
wheat
beer
from
wehenstephaner
shocking
i
know
dunkelweiss
is
a
style
i
havent
been
able
to
come
across
for
a
while
and
im
glad
to
find
it
again
another
great
one
from
weihenstephan
500
ml
bottle
from
the
lcbo
decants
a
murky
brown
with
orange
hues
as
it
is
held
up
to
the
light
in
the
aroma
there
is
soft
fruit
banana
some
spice
clove
some
dark
fruit
tastes
of
sweet
banana
and
clove
dark
fruit
and
a
bit
roastynutty
with
some
yeast
towards
the
end
very
creamy
and
fulfilling
finish
i
like
this
quite
a
bit
d
i
was
so
sad
when
this
beer
was
gone
heres
one
i
could
drink
all
night
and
everyday
d
i
thought
this
brew
to
be
immensely
drinkable
nice
smooth
not
too
carbonated
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
this
is
more
of
a
summer
beer
to
me
not
as
good
as
their
regular
weiss
but
still
exceptional
not
as
tasty
or
put
together
as
some
other
dunkels
ive
had
more
weiss
as
well
light
and
drinkable
though
despite
it
um
i
feel
like
i
should
have
more
to
say
about
this
beer
but
thats
all
i
got
and
yeah
its
beyond
excellent
what
more
is
there
to
say
this
beer
is
something
special
ive
had
enough
dunkelweizens
by
now
to
know
that
a
lot
of
them
overplay
their
spices
and
underplay
their
potential
for
a
textured
body
this
one
hits
them
both
just
right
it
pours
a
muddy
looking
brown
with
a
nice
head
rich
aromas
of
wheat
and
toastiness
with
cloves
and
spices
that
dont
overdo
it
the
flavors
are
rich
and
complex
with
a
very
fullfeeling
texture
that
gives
me
the
impression
of
a
muchchewed
wheat
bread
in
a
glass
absolutely
delicious
in
every
respect
overall
im
a
little
let
down
while
it
is
a
very
refreshing
wheat
beer
i
didnt
really
get
the
hit
of
toasty
darker
malts
i
was
looking
for
maybe
ill
give
it
another
shot
but
right
now
this
dark
deutschlander
will
be
on
the
backburner
as
far
as
wheat
beers
go
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nice
subtle
carbonation
its
a
very
hearty
and
refreshing
beer
nor
anything
that
makes
it
a
worthwhile
pickup
when
this
same
brewery
offers
a
worldclass
weissbier
dopplebock
and
weizenbock
its
good
but
warranting
a
repeat
purchase
is
hard
to
justify
when
the
mighty
weihenstephaner
vitus
the
flavourpacked
korbinian
and
the
endlessly
drinkable
weihenstephaner
weissbier
are
out
there
weihenstephaner
know
how
to
make
a
damn
decent
beer
and
this
dunkelweizen
is
no
exception
d
highly
drinkable
and
an
impressive
session
beer
full
flavored
but
a
little
watery
at
the
end
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
nice
tight
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
light
aromas
of
banana
and
bread
the
taste
is
fuller
and
richer
with
lots
of
banana
and
more
fresh
baked
bread
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
possibly
a
touch
of
astringent
clove
in
the
finish
really
drinkable
and
a
great
late
spring
refresher
it
has
enough
body
and
complexity
to
capture
your
interest
before
a
hefe
is
required
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
really
pleasant
t
similar
to
aroma
spices
and
dried
banana
stand
out
the
most
some
welldone
caramel
sweetness
carries
through
in
the
back
the
body
is
wonderfully
soft
and
slowly
floats
through
your
mouth
leaving
a
juicy
clean
finish
overall
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
definitely
worth
drinking
drinkability
despite
the
recommended
food
tastings
i
had
it
with
a
potatocarrotonionparsnipcream
soup
pottage
and
i
thought
it
went
really
well
with
it
quite
nice
and
a
good
beer
to
savor
over
the
course
of
a
meal
and
later
on
i
could
definitely
have
another
one
of
these
in
fact
the
next
time
i
have
one
of
these
i
think
ill
pair
it
with
a
hefeweissbier
because
i
think
they
would
complement
each
other
very
well
another
simply
amazing
brew
from
weihenstephaner
i
would
pair
this
with
its
brother
hefeweissbier
only
if
it
was
more
readily
available
to
me
at
my
local
definitely
deserves
high
honors
as
a
top
sessionable
beer
poured
a
dark
nut
brown
with
large
beige
head
with
good
retention
smells
of
banana
and
clove
typical
hefeweizen
smells
with
some
malt
as
well
when
i
took
a
sip
my
first
thoughts
were
banana
bread
tastes
of
malt
banana
some
mild
cloves
very
delicious
mouth
feel
was
medium
with
good
carbonation
smooth
and
creamy
high
drinkability
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
dunkelweizen
is
very
interesting
german
style
it
has
everything
people
look
for
in
quality
hefeweizen
with
out
all
the
orange
and
coriander
flavors
instead
they
taste
like
applesauce
tangy
acidity
nice
color
wonderful
flavors
there
is
nothing
not
to
like
about
this
beer
from
the
oldest
still
operating
brewery
in
the
world
drinkability
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
its
got
a
great
flavor
and
texture
that
make
this
eminently
quaffable
body
is
medium
or
even
lightmedium
with
a
high
carbonation
level
crisp
and
refreshing
a
supremely
easy
drinker
i
think
smooth
pretty
much
sums
up
this
beer
where
the
lighter
hefe
comes
through
bright
and
sharp
this
one
mellows
out
and
maybe
loses
a
bit
of
the
refreshing
quality
but
replaces
it
with
a
laid
back
mellower
character
nicely
done
drinkability
really
nice
beer
great
example
of
a
dark
wheat
beer
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
glad
i
picked
this
one
up
this
is
my
second
beer
from
this
brewery
and
its
got
me
wanting
to
try
more
german
beers
drinkability
definitely
worthy
of
another
purchase
a
nice
autumn
beer
with
a
nice
refreshing
quality
balanced
by
a
fuller
malt
flavor
than
a
traditional
hefe
d
im
a
big
fan
of
this
style
and
this
is
probably
my
favorite
version
its
extremely
drinkable
during
any
time
of
year
i
could
drink
these
all
day
d
despite
the
thin
moments
with
the
mouthfeel
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
at
the
price
2
99
i
would
not
hesitate
to
buy
another
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
my
bottle
is
going
somewhat
slow
but
i
will
be
able
to
finish
it
without
a
problem
this
is
another
great
weihenstephaner
beer
probably
not
as
good
as
the
standard
hefeweissebier
but
a
tasty
refreshing
beer
that
fills
hits
all
the
marks
of
a
solid
wheat
beer
frothy
creamy
offwhite
head
of
thick
foam
bubbles
just
large
enough
to
dissolve
quickly
down
from
two
fingers
any
lacing
slides
down
the
glass
sides
murky
light
brown
to
orange
in
color
fairly
muted
actually
looks
like
rusty
pipe
water
the
amount
of
banana
in
the
nose
is
shocking
outpaces
the
mineral
water
as
well
as
the
cinnamon
bun
caramel
clove
cant
shake
this
metallic
edge
gentle
apricot
to
pear
scents
slip
in
unobtrusively
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
has
a
strong
lifting
effect
to
the
point
where
it
combats
the
flavors
as
they
try
to
soak
the
palate
this
keeps
things
waxing
and
waning
from
the
chocolate
caramel
clove
spice
to
the
fig
date
peach
apricot
fruit
nothing
can
rise
above
the
rest
and
enunciate
clearly
more
dough
than
cooked
bread
retains
some
minerally
freshness
creates
a
perfumed
moistness
in
the
mouth
you
just
wish
there
was
more
depth
and
length
in
the
primary
flavors
a
very
good
beer
and
its
this
good
even
being
a
bit
out
of
date
i
really
want
to
try
this
one
fresher
as
with
many
german
beers
locally
fresh
just
doesnt
seem
possible
but
i
was
counting
on
quality
keeping
it
great
tasting
for
a
longer
period
and
i
was
not
dissapointed
cheers
i
wish
i
could
by
this
beer
by
the
gallon
i
would
have
no
trouble
finishing
any
amount
of
this
beer
an
absolutely
fantastic
beer
interestingly
complex
for
a
wheat
beer
one
you
can
savor
given
its
complexities
or
quaff
down
some
food
with
given
its
moderate
abv
preferred
slightly
over
franziskaners
offering
given
the
lighter
malt
body
and
more
evident
subtleties
subpar
for
weihenstephaner
very
drinkable
d
straight
4s
all
around
first
time
ive
ever
rated
a
beer
this
way
on
the
whole
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
like
the
regular
hefe
but
darker
and
bolder
goes
down
easy
tastes
great
and
is
very
refreshing
i
still
prefer
the
original
hefe
i
have
been
typically
steering
away
from
dark
beers
and
wheat
beers
lately
but
this
is
the
best
wheat
beer
i
have
probably
ever
had
and
its
dark
go
figure
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
sweet
malty
and
smooth
bottle
date
reads
7129
which
fyi
means
the
7th
or
17th
day
of
the
12th
week
of
2009
this
beer
looks
awesome
huge
fluffy
head
with
an
effortless
pour
that
never
quite
disappears
tons
of
lacing
unfiltered
hazy
goodness
with
a
copper
hue
that
gets
a
bit
lighter
towards
the
bottom
of
the
glass
smells
wheaty
prominent
banana
and
clove
spicy
tons
of
banana
and
cloves
in
the
flavor
as
well
peppery
some
lemony
zest
excellent
bitternesssweetness
balance
this
is
a
lot
more
similar
to
the
regular
hefe
than
i
anticipated
which
is
not
a
bad
thing
the
malt
is
just
slightly
toastier
the
high
carbonation
lowers
drinkability
but
it
tastes
so
good
that
my
glass
is
emptying
pretty
quickly
great
beer
a
very
pleasant
mouth
feel
too
the
rich
malts
and
fruit
overtones
really
compliment
the
wheat
well
making
for
a
richer
hefeweizen
this
is
a
really
pleasant
and
satisfying
beer
especially
for
the
price
finishes
soft
and
smooth
refreshing
yet
a
real
drinking
experience
cheers
overall
it
may
not
rub
right
with
others
on
here
but
i
think
i
like
this
even
better
than
the
regular
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
perfect
amount
of
flavor
and
just
the
right
amount
of
chewiness
would
have
again
without
a
doubt
d
this
is
a
very
tasty
dark
wheat
beer
its
very
flavorful
yet
light
and
refreshing
not
as
good
as
the
dunkel
or
the
hefeweissbeer
this
is
nonetheless
another
great
beer
from
weihenstephaner
shared
this
one
after
the
dunkel
had
a
good
combination
of
both
beers
with
a
refreshing
quality
that
will
knock
you
out
as
much
a
the
stonger
dunkel
would
recommend
this
if
you
can
find
it
in
the
states
and
once
again
if
in
berlin
you
should
find
this
restaurant
d
personally
i
cant
session
wheat
beers
like
this
the
bread
flavours
seem
to
fill
me
up
too
much
and
wont
leave
room
for
any
other
booze
but
still
an
awesome
beer
that
i
will
endeavour
to
drink
more
of
is
extremely
extremely
smooth
and
drinkable
one
of
my
favorite
dunkels
and
only
second
to
schneider
aventinus
notes
this
very
good
beer
is
not
as
good
as
the
standard
heffeweisbier
but
is
a
very
drinkable
and
respectable
beer
deep
copper
with
orange
tinges
big
fluffy
welcoming
head
that
laced
nicely
typical
banana
clove
and
wheaty
notes
on
the
nose
just
a
little
restrained
wouldve
liked
it
to
jump
out
of
the
glass
a
bit
more
magic
in
the
mouth
smooth
as
silk
nice
carbonation
just
right
for
a
weiss
those
expected
banana
and
clove
notes
melt
nicely
with
a
bit
of
malt
could
drink
this
everyday
without
getting
sick
of
it
yum
pours
coppery
browndarkblood
red
huge
biscuity
head
just
like
every
other
weihen
beer
ive
tried
just
awesome
looking
smells
a
lot
like
a
hefe
big
citrus
banana
some
clove
a
bit
of
cherryness
in
there
also
tastes
a
bit
lighter
than
i
was
expecting
not
a
very
dark
or
strong
dunkel
like
a
slightly
darker
version
of
a
hefe
the
banananess
is
tuned
down
a
notch
from
the
nose
and
maybe
a
bit
more
spicingclove
than
in
the
smell
overall
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
body
like
a
slightly
heavier
hefeweizen
mouthfeel
is
awesome
so
creamy
and
easygoing
a
smooth
easy
drink
not
my
favorite
weihen
brew
but
still
quality
like
all
the
rest
weihenstephaner
is
an
outstanding
brewery
try
as
many
of
their
beers
as
you
can
find
all
of
the
ones
i
have
had
so
far
have
been
great
this
is
such
a
drinkable
dunkelweizen
great
on
a
hot
day
it
reminds
me
a
lot
of
the
hefeweizen
but
the
scents
are
more
subdued
the
maltiness
stronger
in
the
taste
d
not
quite
what
i
expected
honestly
but
a
very
solid
beer
a
tasty
and
drinkable
wheat
beer
that
will
appease
any
wheat
beer
fan
weihenstaphaner
continues
to
impress
me
and
i
will
definitely
search
out
more
of
their
products
no
complaints
here
overall
impression
a
very
good
beer
good
body
not
too
light
but
not
too
heavy
wonderful
flavor
profile
that
makes
this
a
great
pairing
with
dessert
thin
to
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
but
sharp
carbonation
this
brewery
has
a
nack
for
making
perfectly
balanced
supremely
enjoyable
wellrounded
beers
ive
never
had
one
that
wasnt
great
and
this
is
no
exception
still
has
a
nice
spicy
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
is
reasonably
interesting
but
its
a
bit
too
tangy
as
a
complement
to
the
sweeter
malt
as
with
the
hefeweißbier
a
bit
too
bitey
to
be
greatly
drinkable
i
know
this
bottle
was
not
old
at
only
six
months
and
would
definitely
purchase
another
but
still
would
like
to
try
it
a
little
bit
fresher
all
in
all
solid
beer
it
was
very
good
i
will
definitely
drink
this
beer
again
brauerei
weihenstephan
knows
whats
up
another
excellent
beer
crisp
sessionable
beer
very
refreshing
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
beer
that
leaves
you
wanting
more
overall
this
is
a
tasty
dunkel
and
once
again
weihenstephaner
does
their
job
well
worth
a
shot
overall
a
great
dunkelweizen
but
id
reach
for
an
ayinger
first
d
a
bit
disappointed
i
could
not
detect
bittering
hops
and
the
roasted
almost
burnt
malts
made
this
a
tough
one
to
drink
i
really
enjoyed
franziskaners
dunkel
and
expected
similar
features
to
style
im
springing
for
the
flagship
hefe
though
this
one
is
a
great
beer
its
not
quite
as
good
drinkability
excellent
session
beer
highly
recommended
d
all
night
long
this
one
was
finished
in
record
time
ill
check
this
one
quite
often
this
summer
probably
the
best
dunkel
ive
ever
had
this
beer
pours
a
nice
hazy
amber
color
with
an
amazingly
thick
creamy
off
white
head
lots
of
co2
but
that
might
be
helping
the
aroma
the
hefe
yeast
have
done
their
thing
and
there
still
might
be
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
back
the
taste
definitely
hits
the
mark
the
banana
and
spice
is
nicely
rounded
out
by
the
roasted
malts
and
wheat
the
co2
was
a
bit
aggressive
but
a
nice
body
none
the
less
a
very
drinkable
beer
had
this
on
tap
at
the
breezy
point
inn
at
greenwood
lake
the
waitress
taught
me
the
correct
pronunciation
when
i
ordered
following
a
hofbrau
maibock
chunky
brown
with
a
1
12
finger
head
smells
sweet
and
malty
i
agree
with
the
heffedark
malt
take
on
this
beers
taste
crisp
and
malty
sweet
goes
down
easy
this
brew
is
good
but
i
dont
think
its
anything
special
it
tastes
like
a
malty
weihenstephaner
heffe
good
but
better
as
the
heffe
spritzy
carbonation
works
well
to
support
the
traditional
watery
wheat
flavourtexture
highly
drinkable
im
kind
of
embarassed
ive
not
given
this
style
a
fair
shot
before
as
im
more
into
belgian
and
english
styles
while
not
exactly
up
my
alley
this
was
very
interesting
and
enjoyable
after
this
im
going
to
take
a
second
look
to
see
which
other
styles
ive
been
missing
out
on
highly
recommended
the
weihenstephan
crew
definitely
know
how
to
do
it
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
one
of
the
best
dunkels
ive
ever
had
and
it
lived
up
to
the
expectations
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
i
was
a
huge
hefe
lover
a
few
years
back
and
its
probably
best
i
didnt
review
this
beer
then
as
it
would
have
no
doubt
been
brilliant
just
like
others
now
im
a
little
jaded
on
hefe
for
reasons
unknown
however
i
can
say
that
this
is
a
great
dunkel
drinkability
is
killer
i
had
a
stein
of
this
and
needless
to
say
this
was
beyond
magnificent
great
flavor
great
volume
and
overall
provides
a
great
buzz
definitely
grab
a
pint
or
two
of
this
as
you
will
thoroughly
enjoy
it
poured
a
dark
maple
brown
color
with
a
thick
foamy
tan
head
big
and
cloudy
too
nose
is
chocolate
brown
sugar
clove
wheat
and
banana
taste
is
smooth
tasting
beer
with
hints
of
maple
chocolate
maltiness
banana
and
a
touch
of
clove
spiciness
really
good
dunkel
overall
overall
really
awesome
dunkel
i
love
banana
bread
so
a
banana
bread
tasting
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
next
time
im
in
a
dunkel
mood
its
going
to
be
hard
to
find
a
better
candidate
at
the
store
i
strongly
recommend
this
bier
and
everyone
should
have
it
at
least
once
in
their
life
this
along
with
hackerpschorr
are
the
best
weizens
in
the
world
prosit
d
exceptional
drinkability
this
is
a
prime
example
of
a
session
beer
flavorful
refreshing
exciting
and
lower
in
alcohol
i
could
drink
this
year
round
drinkability
is
as
good
as
it
gets
youd
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
brewery
that
makes
weizens
as
good
as
weihenstephaner
drinkability
well
even
after
all
this
time
the
beer
remains
pretty
darned
tasty
sure
its
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
but
its
still
better
than
a
lot
of
fresh
hefs
glad
i
tried
this
and
ill
definitely
edit
my
review
upon
trying
this
fresher
overall
very
drinkable
delicious
flavors
but
not
overpowering
the
subtleties
are
wonderful
and
make
this
beer
very
interesting
i
could
drink
three
of
these
and
still
want
more
nice
roasted
flavor
i
didnt
expect
very
refreshing
for
how
complex
this
is
beer
poured
into
my
paulaner
weisbier
glass
brew
is
cloudy
and
brownishorange
in
color
beautiful
pillowy
3
finger
head
is
formed
easily
even
with
a
gentle
pour
rings
of
lacing
cling
to
the
glass
and
the
head
rescinds
a
bit
initially
but
then
holds
2
cm
or
so
for
most
of
the
beer
nose
is
malty
with
lemony
notes
as
well
as
what
i
can
best
describe
as
jalapeno
taste
is
sublime
beer
is
amazingly
well
balanced
caramel
is
present
and
some
malty
sweetness
beer
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
the
finish
leaves
a
light
lingering
caramel
taste
you
just
want
to
keep
drinking
this
and
quickly
and
i
polished
this
one
off
quickly
this
and
gordon
biersch
dw
are
the
best
ive
had
just
really
getting
into
the
dunkels
and
this
is
by
far
the
best
ive
had
to
me
lots
of
drinkability
but
more
of
a
night
capper
than
anything
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
despite
the
light
mouthfeel
i
still
feel
that
this
beer
has
alot
to
offer
with
its
crisp
taste
and
refreshing
finish
drinkability
is
perfect
and
most
likely
the
fresher
the
better
hefty
white
pillowy
head
with
plenty
of
stick
atop
a
murky
dark
amber
body
with
plenty
of
brown
hue
to
it
reeks
of
delicious
ripe
banana
with
subtle
malt
sweetness
complexity
of
the
taste
is
standout
a
subtle
peppery
and
very
faint
clove
spiciness
owes
it
to
the
yeasts
work
on
the
wheat
bready
malt
sweetness
covers
the
tongue
banana
settles
down
considerably
after
its
work
in
the
aroma
but
still
plays
a
solid
part
in
the
taste
slightly
drying
finish
man
words
just
dont
really
do
it
justice
chewy
mouthfeel
with
a
great
level
of
carbonation
not
exactly
viscous
but
it
just
coats
your
mouth
in
a
similar
way
a
truly
great
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
this
is
the
most
refreshing
dunkel
weizen
ive
ever
had
too
bad
this
isnt
readily
available
in
my
neck
of
the
odenwald
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
and
hazy
medium
amber
color
ale
with
a
supper
huge
offwhite
foamy
head
with
great
retention
and
good
lacing
aroma
of
banana
ester
with
some
great
wheat
malt
is
quite
excellent
taste
is
very
smooth
with
great
notes
of
banana
ester
with
some
lightly
sweet
wheat
malty
which
provide
a
great
refreshing
factor
full
creamy
body
with
great
carbonation
one
of
the
best
example
of
the
style
drinkability
a
delightful
dunkelweizen
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
go
out
and
get
some
taste
is
much
more
muted
than
i
expected
this
is
very
much
a
thirst
quencher
for
a
hot
day
clove
flavor
is
the
most
prevalent
yeasty
ester
but
there
is
some
banana
and
bubblegum
in
there
too
zippy
wheat
tang
finishes
crisp
and
smooth
can
i
have
another
please
brauerei
weihenstephan
continues
to
impress
while
i
dont
find
this
one
quite
as
special
as
vitus
or
hefeweissbier
it
is
very
tasty
this
one
just
doesnt
have
quite
the
depth
or
breadth
to
reach
that
level
nonetheless
it
is
easily
one
of
the
top
dunkelweizens
out
there
and
should
definitely
be
sought
out
d
very
good
drinkability
session
type
beer
first
of
this
style
ive
had
i
prefer
the
regular
hefe
but
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
would
love
to
drink
again
d
this
is
a
very
pleasant
drinking
beer
i
could
easily
see
having
several
of
these
at
the
biergarten
i
can
see
why
this
yeast
has
become
the
premier
dunkelweizen
yeast
excellent
flavor
profiles
this
review
comes
from
31609
which
is
close
to
three
years
since
i
last
reviewed
it
on
the
other
hand
i
have
had
it
numberous
times
since
then
pour
went
in
to
a
schneider
edel
weiss
glass
color
was
a
light
tan
brown
about
a
finger
of

smells
of
powdered
brown
bread
bananas
cloves
more
fruit
and
bread
in
the
taste
extremely
complex
drinkability
is
perfect
carbonation
in
just
the
right
place
the
best
dunkelweiss
out
there
one
of
the
best
beers
out
there
a
very
nice
dunkelweizen
you
cant
get
much
more
flavorful
than
this
and
its
so
easy
to
drink
which
adds
to
its
appeal
overall
i
would
say
this
is
another
success
by
weihenstephaner
this
is
a
great
hefe
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
caramel
brown
color
with
2cm
of
creamy
tan
head
that
shrinks
a
little
but
never
really
goes
away
it
smells
of
yeast
banana
raisins
and
some
hops
i
cant
identify
very
pleasant
the
taste
is
much
like
the
aroma
yeast
banana
raisins
just
enough
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
it
out
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
like
a
hefe
should
be
but
still
somewhat
heavy
and
not
watery
at
all
overall
its
very
drinkable
like
every
other
weihenstephaner
beer
ive
ever
had
a
tad
too
thin
at
first
but
good
carbonation
level
and
refreshing
halfliter
bottle
with
a
batchcode
on
the
back
label
it
pours
an
opaque
mahogany
with
lively
carbonation
that
builds
up
a
threefinger
head
which
reduces
to
a
quarterinch
and
leaves
little
lacing
one
the
nose
its
bananas
spicy
yeast
wheat
chocolate
some
grassiness
a
touch
of
cloves
and
perhaps
some
nuttiness
light
wheat
and
chocolate
on
the
palate
yeast
a
mild
bitterness
and
just
a
kiss
of
green
hops
on
top
of
a
medium
tingly
and
dry
yet
smooth
body
very
drinkable
and
quite
delicious
one
of
the
benchmarks
for
the
style
d
this
would
be
a
definite
session
beer
for
me
delicious
incredibly
affordable
low
abv
light
crisp
and
sweet
ill
be
buying
these
over
and
over
again
sweet
banana
and
fruity
flavours
almost
bubblegummy
has
a
crisp
mouthfeel
with
light
carbonation
very
smooth
very
nice
this
is
probably
exceptional
on
draft
i
think
i
might
like
this
better
than
their
bottled
hefe
i
could
session
this
all
night
great
malty
wheat
beer
with
a
flavor
that
is
clean
spicy
and
full
the
beer
is
a
light
brown
with
a
frothy
head
the
nose
has
a
ton
of
wonderfullyspiced
banana
there
are
wonderful
caramel
malt
flavors
lurking
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
malt
is
sweet
and
doughy
there
is
some
light
bitterness
bananas
and
cloves
come
in
from
the
wheat
its
a
maltier
version
of
the
hefeweizen
great
beer
overall
fantastic
one
of
the
best
looking
dunkels
ive
seen
and
the
rest
of
it
is
a
complete
enjoyment
the
body
needs
a
little
more
weight
which
would
probably
give
the
taste
a
bigger
presence
as
well
and
made
this
one
a
whopper
other
than
that
this
is
spot
on
very
enjoyable
and
dangerously
drinkable
this
is
one
ill
be
grabbing
again
either
at
the
shop
or
at
the
belgian
bar
in
the
city
yum
a
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
dunkelweizen
d
wow
this
one
could
be
dangerous
on
a
summer
day
make
that
any
day
when
youve
got
a
good
thirst
built
up
if
you
like
weizen
beers
this
is
a
must
try
deliciously
bitter
without
being
aggressive
so
being
a
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
experience
good
beer
to
keep
at
hand
d
a
very
clean
and
crisp
beer
thats
a
pleasure
to
drink
the
carbonation
and
light
body
remind
me
why
the
liter
beers
in
munich
went
down
so
quickly
weinhenstephaner
is
a
perfect
example
of
german
breweries
theres
a
reason
why
this
is
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
they
know
how
to
make
a
beautiful
tasty
beer
pours
a
nice
cloudy
dark

with
a

excellent

wheaty
a
faint
lemon
light
spices
has
a
nice
balance
of
spice
wheat
and
an
amazing
malt
that
comes
together
beautifully
mouthfeel
very
light
and
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
fantastic
product
as
you
would
expect
from
such
a
distinguished
brewery
mff
the
carbonation
makes
a
crisp
clear
drinking
beverage
that
is
more
than
smooth
to
drink
though
not
overwhelming
the
carbonation
is
a
prominent
effect
in
the
finish
and
tasting
process
i
find
nothing
wrong
whatsoever
with
this
beers
feel
or
drinkability
it
is
wholly
amazing
an
to
be
awed
at
admired
copied
and
respected
taste
starts
off
with
a
slight
banana
and
yeast
there
is
a
subtle
chewiness
that
finishes
with
an
ever
so
slight
carbonation
mouthfeel
smoothness
and
relatively
low
abv
make
this
one
very
drinkable
beer
due
to
the
color
i
was
expecting
this
beer
to
be
a
little
bit
thicker
and
a
little
more
chewy
very
good
beer
though
decent
carbonation
and
mediumlight
body
make
this
delicious
and
refreshing
an
absolutely
easy
one
to
knock
back
all
day
fantastic
beer
superb
german
beer
from
brewers
who
dont

weihenstephan
once

found
this
to

smooth

only

a

are

better
when
you
take

do
more

another
excellent

from
weihenstephaner
d
excellent

well

would
drink
again
but
im
not

it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
based
on
the
stellar
reviews
of

bas
the
taste
is
again
a
more
darkly
toasted
version
of
their
hefeweissebier
more
darkly
toasted
grain
hint
of
toffee
some
bubblegum
and
banana
but
less
than
the
hefeweissbier
its
light

yet
has
nice
complexity

balance
of
flavours
making
it
unusually
interesting
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
well

dunkel
with
just
enough
caramel
malts
to
satisfy
the
palate
and
enough
restraint
on
the

aroma
tastes
great
with
malt

coming
through
its
considered
world
class
by
many
and
i
must
agree
this
beer
really
hits
the
spot
when
im
looking
for
something
sweet
and
malty
a
must
try
purchased
at
chans

world
in

city

florida
drinkability
is
amazing
i
could
drink
these
all
day
every
day
at

a
bottle
makes
it
a
good
deal
as
well
if
you
like
weihenstephaner
or
wheat
beers
in
general
you
should
definately
try
to
find
this
one
pours
a
hazy
brown
orange
color
with
a
small
white
head
bananas
and
floral
yeasty
esters
toasty
sweet
caramel
malt
and
a
spicy
hop
bitterness
good
medium
body
gets
a
bit
more
chewy
as
the
beer
warms
and
nears
the
bottom
very
drinkable
d
its
light
but
it
feels
heavy
full
flavored
and
refreshing
the
top
ddub
on
my
list
hands
down
d
its
definitely
an
easy
drinker
and
a
nice
transition
from
the
warmweather
wheats
to
the
fall
seasonals
i
drank
this
on
an
unexpectedly
warm
fall
evening
id
look
for
it
again
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkelweizen
this
beer
looks
like
cider
like
bubbly
apple
cider
the
difference
here
being
the
enormous
rootbeer
floatlike
head
that
tops
this
baby
off
but
doesnt
cling
too
well
oh
yeah
it
smells
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
different
than
a
cider
as
well
banana
bread
but
that
is
a
bit
of
an
overstatement
to
be
honest
weve
got
slight
bits
of
cinnamonapple
andor
cloves
but
more
of
an
apply
kind
of
aroma
rather
than
just
plain
cloves
yeast
is
a
beast
on
this
does
some
wonderful
things
to
this
beer
first
sips
reveals
decent
amounts
of
everything
sort
of
like
picking
and
choosing
different
spices
from
your
spice
rack
sounds
lame
but
its
true
slight
standard
banana
but
with
an
added
creamier
depth
to
everything
ive
never
had
a
pumpkin
beer
but
i
feel
like
i
get
the
idea
of
one
as
i
drink
this
beer
the
creamy
and
spicy
characteristics
of
this
beer
lead
me
to
believe
this
yet
for
all
this
beer
has
to
offer
and
its
a
lot
something
about
this
beer
leaves
me
wanting
more
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
bit
lagging
and
taste
is
a
bit
one
sided
a
good
but
not
great
beer
this
is
a
beer
that
i
imagine
would
taste
quite
a
bit
better
fresh
but
then
again
what
beer
wouldnt
d
very
drinkable
and
the
flavors
mesh
really
really
well
definately
worth
a
try
overall
this
is
a
solid
drink
with
a
bit
more
character
than
the
standard
hefeweizen
of
the
same
brewery
pours
a
dark
opaque
golden
brown
with
a
thick
foamy
pale
tan
head
nice
fairly
strong
aroma
is
wheaty
malty
and
rubbery
with
hints
of
orange
and
spice
flavor
is
rich
wheaty

malty

has
a
spicy
and
orangy
undertone

smooth
and
finish
is
pleasing
and
satisfying
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
creamy
one
of
my
new
favorites
d
overall
the
appearance
gentle
aroma
summery
flavours
light
easy
mouthfeel
definately
left
me
wanting
more
this
is
one
beautiful
drop
with
flavours
leaving
me
pining
for
more
go
an
easy
6
pack
of
this
mouthfeel
is
thick
and
substantial
creamy
up
front
with
a
peppery
finish
drinkable
any
time
d
great
taste
easy
drink
definitely
a
sessionable
beer
d
personally
i
could
do
with
a
little
more
fruitiness
and
nuttiness
in
my
dunkels
but
this
is
obviously
a
top
notch
example
while
there
are
others
that
are
more
suited
to
my
palate
this
is
a
highly
balanced
example
and
as
with
most
dunkels
i
appreciate
the
relative
lack
of
phenols
if
i
had
to
pick
a
favorite
beer
this
could
easily
be
the
one
i
will
buy
this
one
again
cloudy
dark
amber
brown
color
with
a
pillowed
creamcolored
head
aromas
of
yeast
dough
bananas
and
bubblegum
bubblegum
banana
flavor
mixed
with
caramel
and
slight
clove
notes
on
a
medium
body
the
fruity
chewing
gum
follows
through
to
the
finish
on
a
slightly
tart
wheat
flavor
d
it
was
refreshing
complex
with
great
balance
and
wonderful
taste
a
bit
heavy
for
a
long
session
but
great
for
a
session
beer
if
you
are
a
fan
of
heffwieissbier
drinkability
refreshing
enough
not
as
drinkable
as
the
regular
but
still
a
good
score
in
this
department
highly
recommended
the
first
sip
was
a
challenge
getting
through
that
head
in
the
tall
weiss
glass
is
a
challenge
lets
try
again
tip
it
a
little
further
oh
what
beautiful
carbonated
tingling
to
the
taste
buds
behind
the
tingle
was
some
sweetness
and
citrus
with
hints
of
caramel
this
is
a
fine
drinkable
beer
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
better
example
of
german
wheat
beer
d
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
i
could
easily
drink
this
all
night
good
flavor
and
aroma
and
sessionable
alcohol
content
i
dont
think
this
is
better
than
franziskaner
dunkelweiss
imo
but
its
definitely
up
there
deep
mahogany
color
with
a
silky
tan
head
nose
has
citrus
fruits
candy
malts
and
spicy
yeasts
taste
was
a
little
dull
in
relation
still
a
nice
mixture
between
sweet
wheat
malts
tart
fruits
and
peppery
yeast
strains
nice
clean
crisp
body
another
great
brew
from
weihenstephan
taste
is
creamy
and
thick
cocoa
malt
touch
of
spice
some
wheat
slight
banana
and
some
yeast
d
pretty
tasty
i
had
this
with
smoked
pulled
pork
sandwiches
and
it
complemented
the
pork
and
honey
bbq
sauce
i
was
using
nicely
this
dunkel
is
very
similar
to
the
schneider
weisse
original
which
is
also
dark
for
a
hefe
very
good
flavors
with
this
weihenstephaner
and
definitely
a
beer
id
have
again
really
terrific
dunkelweizen
i
need
to
drink
some
more
but
compared
with
the
standard
hefeweizen
versus
an
aventinus
i
find
it
somewhat
lacking
in
complexity
and
heft
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
for
a
thin
tawny
brown
think
thin
syrup
with
a
soapy
threefinger
head
that
stayed
forever
because
of
constant
carbonation
left
lace
patches
a
sharper
than
expected
citric
hop
smell
with
some
pepper
clove
notes
also
picked
up
vauge
sugary
malt
smells
along
with
some
caramel
and
chocolate
a
great
citric
bite
when
it
first
hit
my
tongue
with
banana
and
orange
prominent
along
with
clove
and
some
pepper
mediumbodied
and
smooth
with
some
creaminess
also
tasted
some
chocolate
and
roasted
malts
with
a
drying
backbite
couldve
been
some
coffee
malts
also
not
an
ultra
heavy
dunkle
this
is
a
great
beer
to
sip
on
and
have
a
couple
at
any
time
d
amazingly
drinkable
here
just
a
touch
maltier
than
the
original
with
a
deep
down
notes
of
roastiness
and
chocolate
a
definite
must
have
staple
in
the
fridge
mouthfeel
drinkability
wonderfully
spicy
and
tangy
finish
d
this
beer
goes
down
very
easily
nice
balanced
flavor
combined
with
a
crisp
feel
and
medium
body
makes
for
one
hell
of
a
drinkable
beer
poured
into
a
hefeweizen
glass
showing
a
pleasant
icedtea
color
with
a
huge
dirtywhite
head
that
very
leisurely
skated
down
the
sides
riding
the
beer
to
the
bottom
this
had
an
outstanding
and
understated
aroma
of
prunes
and
cherries
in
addition
to
muted
bananas
and
nutmeg
mildly
fizzy
going
in
lots
of
malt
at
the
back
end
that
lingered
a
long
time
definitely
a
bit
denser
than
a
plain
hefeweizen
but
not
heavy
an
absolute
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
very
nice
cloudy
brown
with
some
slight
yellow
tints
and
a
lovely
foamy
white
head
pour
these
slowly
nose
is
all
banana
and
wheat
taste
follows
with
super
banana
and
cloviness
bubble
gummy
flavor
and
radical
wheat
and
yeast
flavor
a
very
light
malty
caramel
note
in
here
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
great
smooth
feel
drinkability
is
second
to
none
that
i
have
had
and
makes
me
wish
i
had
a
case
of
these
for
a
hot
summer
day
a
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
the
closest
to
perfect
i
have
found
anyway
a
goddamn
delicious
brew
really
no
other
way
to
say
it
weihenstephaner
to
me
still
is
my
benchmark
beer
for
hefeweizens
and
other
related
brews
in
its
family
an
excellent
brewery
this
is
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
although
pricey
im
definitely
going
to
get
some
more
this
is
a
medium
bodied
very
carbonated
dunkel
it
has
a
full
palate
of
nice
malty
flavors
some
apple
and
clove
notes
and
a
big
blast
of
sweetish
wheat
like
flavors
there
is
a
slight
green
apple
tartness
to
the
beer
towards
the
finish
and
a
bubble
gum
sweetness
in
the
middle
this
is
a
fairly
complex
beer
with
loads
of
flavors
drifting
in
and
out
there
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
some
a
little
toasted
some
very
wheaty
but
all
very
enjoyable
the
beer
finishes
a
bit
tart
with
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
but
very
slight
this
is
a
beer
well
worth
seeking
out
it
is
refreshing
and
eminently
drinkable
lchaim
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
it
may
sit
at
the
bottom
of
my
top
5
hefes
but
thats
still
better
than
the
vast
majority
of
the
hefes
out
there
d
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
for
sure
its
very
wellconstructed
and
goes
down
easy
drinkability
again
the
low
abv
yields
a
fantastically
drinkable
beer
its
about
a
halfstep
away
from
perfection
in
my
mind
but
its
still
in
the
running
for
the
standard
of
its
style
pours
a
copper
amber
brownish
color
somewhat
murky
with
a
big
frothy
head
that
lasts
for
days
smell
is
subtle
but
nice
and
clean
spices
mainly
clove
banana
light
doughy
scent
some
caramel
and
hints
of
brown
sugar
yeast
taste
is
great
nice
and
wellrounded
basically
same
as
the
nose
a
sweetness
but
a
nice
spice
and
light
bitterness
to
counter
it
again
very
balanced
and
tasty
apples
are
also
present
here
mouthfeel
is
perfection
crisp
but
creamy
if
thats
possible
so
soft
and
delicate
on
the
tongue
this
makes
it
go
down
all
too
soon
quite
the
drinkable
brew
and
a
classic
example
of
this
style
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
i
think
i
need
to
revisit
the
regular
hefe
ah
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
what
a
pleasant
surprise
the
pour
is
a
murky
water
brown
an
extravagent
pillowey
head
forms
and
never
leaves
the
aroma
fills
my
nose
with
some
nice
banana
and
clove
scents
the
flavor
is
good
there
is
a
nice
touch
of
sweet
maltiness
that
helps
tame
the
yeast
wheat
dominance
as
stated
before
this
beer
is
really
smooth
and
absolutely
enjoyable
this
dunkelweiss
is
much
better
than
their
original
hefeweiss
this
beer
is
a
nice
dark
amber
color
pours
slightly
clear
until
you
add
the
yeast
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
with
a
thick
dense
white
head
the
aroma
is
of
a
nice
banana
and
clove
yeast
aroma
some
soft
sweet
breadiness
as
well
the
flavor
has
a
bit
of
malt
sweetness
with
fruity
banna
flavor
the
body
is
medium
with
a
robust
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
especially
as
a
hot
summer
quencher
d
i
wish
i
had
another
and
another
this
is
my
new
dunkelweizen
standard
one
of
the
best
dunkelweizens
ive
ever
had
d
easy
to
drink
a
definite
must
if
you
want
to
live
on
the
darker
side
of
summer
dexcellent
brew
head
if
its
class
could
be
my
everyday
session
beer
mouthfeel
is
effervescent
and
lively
but
the
entire
package
is
just
a
bit
wanting
this
dunkelweizen
is
truly
one
of
the
best
as
far
as
presentation
goes
be
that
as
it
may
i
still
think
i
prefer
franziskaner
in
the
flavor
department
pours
a
nice
murky
brown
with
a
huge
rocky
head
nice
lacing
on
the
surface
the
whole
way
down
the
glass
aroma
has
cloves
bananas
a
hint
of
smoke
with
some
underlying
sweetness
taste
has
great
wheat
spicy
complexity
cloves
cinnamon
bananas
and
pears
a
bit
of
roasted
malt
flavor
some
yeasty
earthiness
medium
to
full
bodied
and
well
carbonated
pretty
drinkable
and
and
an
excellent
dunkel
slightly
toasted
banana
flavor
along
with
clove
and
coriander
spiciness
create
a
pleasant
dark
beer
summery
flavor
marshmallow
sweetness
followed
along
with
a
very
subtle
bitterness
overall
this
is
a
nice
dunkel
that
is
worth
a
try
an
enjoyable
dunkel
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
could
be
an
all
year
beer
instead
of
just
a
summer
beer
d
drinkable
in
spades
outstanding
for
the
style
and
even
better
for
summer
consumption
when
one
tends
to
veer
for
lighter
brews
yum
very
drinkable
and
at
5
3
abv
quite
sessionable
md
carbonation
not
really
that
noticeable
as
in
most
beer
of
the
style
the
beer
was
smooth
and
creamy
but
as
noted
above
slightly
watered
down
overall
still
highly
drinkable
a
good
dunkle
but
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
this
needs
a
more
bold
roasted
flavor
in
my
opinion
still
very
enjoyable
and
one
i
will
not
pass
up
very
much
when
i
see
it
had
this
at
track
84
on
draft
a
couple
weeks
ago
and
thought
it
was
excellent
but
wasnt
really
able
to
take
notes
so
here
goes
served
in
my
oberon
weizen
poured
a
translucent
brownishamber
with
gold
highlights
tight
dense
four
inch
offwhite
head
with
lots
of
sticky
lacing
present
throughout
the
tasting
scent
of
spices
hits
you
immediately
out
of
the
bottle
corriander
and
clove
followed
by
bubblegum
and
a
light
banana
essence
wheat
flavor
dominates
up
front
in
the
mouth
flavors
identified
in
the
nose
are
present
but
very
much
watered
down
and
somewhat
muted
and
bland
also
detected
a
light
yeastiness
towards
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
watery
and
light
without
very
much
effervescence
surprising
considering
the
density
of
the
head
very
good
drinkability
went
down
easy
but
the
experience
was
very
different
than
when
i
sampled
it
on
draft
d
drinkability
was
incredibly
rich
creamy
sweet
and
very
smooth
going
down
d
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
although
it
comes
across
dark
it
is
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
it
is
not
intimidating
in
flavor
and
very
well
rounded
great
beer
this
one
looked
incredible
a
deep
orangeybrown
color
with
a
huge
frothy
head
that
sat
up
there
for
forever
nose
was
a
ton
of
yeast
wheat
sweet
but
roasted
caramel
malt
taste
was
likewise
really
delicious
although
not
quite
as
overwhelmingly
flavorful
as
their
standard
hefeweizen
feel
was
nice
and
thick
good
for
the
style
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
i
would
get
again
drinkability
here
is
good
this
isnt
something
ive
tried
before
so
i
dont
know
the
style
too
well
but
it
has
amazing
character
and
ill
be
getting
a
few
more
i
wonder
how
this
is
a
bit
warmer
the
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
smooth
drinkability
is
excellent
this
is
a
beer
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
on
a
warm
summer
day
freshly
baked
wheat
bread
sits
beneath
a
perfect
blend
of
bananas
and
cloves
more
of
a
ripe
banana
bread

than
just
straight

there
as
well
whiffs

or
less

up

as
well

take
over
some
banana
bitterness
around
the
edges
and
through
the
finish
clove
and
rye
bread
spice
come
in
near
the
finish
thick
proteinrich
feel
a
bit
drier
in
the
finish
damn
good
man
these
guys
know
wheat
beers
mfd
outstanding
a
must
try
pours
a
cloudy
copper
penny
color
with
a
nice
even
white
head
nose
is
malt
and
esters
caramel
and
tart
fruit
taste
is
a
delightful
light
maltiness
with
a
healthy
serving
of
hef
fruitinesscitrus
a
deliciously
light
malty
beer
mouthfeel
is
nicely
middle
of
the
road
considerably
fuller
and
chewier
than
a
standard
hef
but
light
enough
to
still
be
an
enjoyable
warmweather
beer
at
5
30
its
still
very
sessionable
a
very
good
beer
there
was
this
month
or
two
in
my
life
midsummer
that
i
was
living
in
a
flop
spot
and
looking
for
a
job
and
i
was
eating
all
these
granola
bars
someone
threw
out
and
cans
of
peaches
in
the
oppressive
summer
heat
and
i
blew
my
grocery
budget
on
a
bottle
of
good
single
malt
scotch
that
i
would
make
a
dinner
out
of
it
was
good
but
a
case
of
this
wouldve
been
a
better
way
to
spend
that
50
bucks
crisply
carbonated
and
a
bit
spicy
d
quite
spicy
this
is
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
easily
drinkable
d
good
nice
flavors
and
easy
to
drink
perfect
carbonation
with
a
smooth
finish
and
an
intriguing
essence
of
clarified
butter
easily
quaffed
and
frankly
hard
not
to
average
body
very
light
smooth
and
refreshing
maybe
there
is
a
reason
they
have
been
brewing
for
so
long
a
very
elegant
beer
sure
to
impress
and
sure
to
satisfy
overall
an
excellent
dunkel
certainly
lives
up
to
its
ratings
recommended
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
not
too
sweet
not
too
thick
just
right
for
a
hefe
weizen
good
work
weihenstephan
the
smell
brought
scents
of
cloves
bananas
yeast
malt
and
lemon
it
was
sweet
malts
initially
finished
semi
dry
it
had
the
classic
hef
taste
but
also
some
yeastiness
which
gave
it
some
excellent
complexity
it
did
taste
close
to
banana
bread
overall
a
excellent
beer
to
drink
anytime
i
bet
it
would
be
awesome
on
sunny
day
d
my
first
dunkelweizen
in
a
while
a
tasty
beer
though
i
do
prefer
their
regular
hefe
beer
poured
from
a
bomber
into
a
weizen
glass
i
acquired
with
this
great
sampler
poured
a
hazy
iced
tea
brown
with
mysterious
cloudy
movement
very
intriguing
i
get
my
balls
broken
for
always
picking
up
banana
smells
in
my
weiss
beers
but
this
one
had
banana
all
over
it
followed
by
hints
of
fresh
bread
awesome
smell
loved
the
smell
but
was
blown
away
by
the
taste
banana
sweetness
followed
by
delicious
chewy
biscuit
breadiness
and
finishing
with
a
very
faint
malt
flavor
nice
chewy
thick
mouthfeel
each
swallow
left
behind
a
delicious
tasty
coating
a
perfectly
balanced
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
orangebrown
with
a
nice
tight
white
head
that
fades
to
a
ring
light
aromas
of
banana
and
bread
the
taste
is
fuller
and
richer
with
lots
of
banana
and
more
fresh
baked
bread
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
possibly
a
touch
of
astringent
clove
in
the
finish
really
drinkable
and
a
great
late
spring
refresher
it
has
enough
body
and
complexity
to
capture
your
interest
before
a
hefe
is
required
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
really
pleasant
drinkability
a
couple
in
a
row
would
go
down
smooth
a
warm
weather
beer
with
a
little
more
to
it
ive
yet
to
try
a
weihenstephaner
that
i
didnt
like
respectfully
extremely
drinkable
and
sessionable
drinkability
is
quite
good
its
a
tasty
well
balanced
easy
drinking
beer
and
spot
on
for
the
style
supremely
drinkable
a
standard
for
dunkleweiss
nothing
better
for
cooler
days
and
night
delicious
and
easy
to
knock
back
as
many
as
you
want
it
is
a
bit
more
filling
than
a
hefe
due
to
the
more
substantial
body
but
who
cares
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
clean
very
sessionable
im
going
to
have
to
revisit
this
one
in
the
summer
all
in
all
a
fine
beer
not
the
best
dunkell
hefeweissbier
ive
ever
had
but
well
up
there
with
the
better
ones
this
dunkleweizen
pours
out
a
darkamber

from
the

is
absolutley
refreshingly
deliciousclovescitrusbanana
on
the
finish
some
bready
yeasts
in
there
as
well
crisp
mouthfeel
makes
for
crazy
good
drinkablity
having
this
beer
oder
radlerwith
a
splash
of
lemonade
is
how
it
was
presented
to
me
in
germany
where
they
drink
this
at
10
am
read
on
the
health
benefits
of
these
brews
and
these
people
are
really
on
to
something
i
can
see
me
drinking
a
lot
of
this
in
the
summer
months
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
brewery
just
continues
to
impress
me
with
their
knack
for
keeping
beers
simple
and
making
them
very
very
well
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
d
outstanding
this
brewery
is
awesome
i
cant
wait
to
pop
the
hefeweizen
an
excellent
brew
very
highly
recommended
d
i
have
one
of
these
in
front
of
me
the
whole
night
through
the
flavor
was
nice
along
the
same
lines
was
stronger
of
the
sour
bacteria
and
the
aged
malt
no
hops
anywhere
in
this
beer
at
this
point
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
i
was
told
that
last
year
this
same
batch
was
at
its
peak
too
bad
appearance
cloudy
brown
white
head
that
left
to
quickly
but
had
decent
lacing
on
the
edge
smell
tosted
grains
and
hints
of
apple
taste
tosted
grain
caramel
and
again
apple
mouthfeel
mediam
body
and
high
carbonation
drinkability
not
bad
if
its
late
spring
or
early
fall
i
will
buy
this
one
again
overall
a
superior
dunkel
still
a
decent
beer
a
beautiful
beer
mouthfeel
holy
smooth
beer
minimal
bitterness
smooth
texture
and
perfect
carbonation
youll
never
get
tired
of
having
this
in
your
glass
i
wish
i
had
a
second
bottle
off
veetersayin
d
fantastic
drinkability
classic
weizen
flavours
with
the
nice
chocolateyness
of
the
dunkel
sprizty
and
refreshing
a
classic
from
a
world
class
breweryonly
gave
a
4
for
appearance
as
i
like
dunkels
to
be
darker
but
thats
just
me
md
light
to
medium
bodied
very
low
carbonation
on
the
tongue
excellent
drinkability
really
smooth
and
refreshing
overall
i
doubted
that
this
would
be
as
good
as
the
regular
hefe
but
i
was
certainly
wrong
well
what
can
one
say
about
this
beer
yes
it
is
a
dunkelweizen
or
dark
wheat
beer
but
really
it
is
an
absolute
fantastic
beer
i
have
read
so
much
latley
about
how
german
beers
are
one
dimensional
and
boring
but
after
drinking
a
beer
like
this
how
can
anyone
belive
that
stupid
argument
this
beer
is
great
looking
smells
better
and
tastes
better
than
that
try
one
you
will
see
throughout
this
review
you
might
have
noticed
that
i
found
this
brew
really
sweet
wait
until
i
brew
my
own
hefewiezen
and
i
bet
ill
appreciate
this
one
more
but
for
now
meh
d
again
the
carbonation
was
a
little
strong
a
touch
of
bloat
which
i
would
not
expect
following
only
2
drinks
goes
down
seemingly
light
but
bottoms
out
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
on
the
pour
the
beer
looks
just
like
fresh
apple
cider
with
a
smell
of
mault
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
nice
fluffy
head
that
stays
for
a
bit
with
a
touch
of
stickeyness
good
taste
of
mault
and
maybe
butterscotch
that
balances
out
well
almost
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
good
maybe
a
little
fuzzy
but
good
none
the
less
a
very
drinkable
brew
with
a
nice
taste
another
high
score
for
weihenstephaner
d
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
it
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
pours
a
clouded
gold
brown
with
no
head
nose
is
slightly
sweet
in
a
banana
kind
of
way
that
is
basically
the
prevalent
fragrance
that
hits
you
the
whole
time
bananas
big
fields
of
them
flavor
is
smooth
and
a
bit
mild
but
even
there
is
that
hefe
typical
character
there
with
a
strong
banana
skin
profile
to
it
just
like
the
nose
feel
is
smooth
on
the
mouth
definitely
drinkable
a
really
good
brew
that
is
worth
trying
overall
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
possibly
buying
again
but
not
one
that
i
would
actively
look
for
or
really
try
to
buy
frequently
this
style
seems
to
be
all
over
the
place
from
lots
of
ester
presence
to
lots
of
malt
presence
and
everything
in
between
if
you
like
the
malty
emphasis
then
you
will
like
this
d
was
okay
the
carbonation
bite
and
the
weight
of
the
beer
makes
this
a
little
cumbersome
very
impressive
in
my
weihenstephaner
glass
this
beer
poured
a
cloudy
murky
light
tan
color
and
formed
a
foamy
off
white
head
that
left
latticed
lace
as
it
subsided
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
is
present
an
aroma
of
cloves
spice
and
a
hint
of
malt
a
flavor
of
malt
clove
and
spices
the
body
is
medium
light
and
slightly
sweet
finish
very
much
like
a
hefe
but
with
slightly
different
charactistics
d
very
drinkable
the
cleanliness
at
the
end
keeps
the
flavors
at
bay
so
they
dont
interfere
with
a
meal
this
would
be
a
great
dinner
beer
but
it
isnt
really
my
style
for
casual
drinking
i
will
be
buying
it
again
3
on
my
list
was
this
one
pours
a
hazy
medbrown
w
a
huge
fluffy
offwhite
head
which
lasted
good
lacing
as
well
another
dunkelweizen
that
turns
tricolor
in
my
weizen
glass
this
one
went
from
straw
to
a
reddishgold
to
light
brown
in
front
of
my
bluspectrum
flourescent
desk
lamp
the
bubbles
only
visible
in
the
light
part
of
the
beer
start
to
rise
slowly
at
first
then
after
where
the
glass
narrows
they
scream
skyward
out
sorry
its
just
kinda
trippy
a
fruity
breadlike
aroma
w
a
slight
citrusy
banannaish
undertone
a
tart
fruity
taste
crisp
and
malty
w
hints
of
caramel
lemon
and
coriander
a
light
body
w
plenty
of
bubbles
sticks
on
the
tounge
just
long
enough
to
let
the
flavors
come
through
and
dry
enough
to
make
you
want
more
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
consider
this
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
tried
wheat
beer
is
glorious
and
this
one
is
even
better
as
its
a
dunkel
very
malty
and
fruity
while
not
bogging
you
down
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
if
you
like
munich
dunkels
and
hefeweizens
you
should
give
this
a
try
its
not
the
best
of
both
worlds
but
its
pretty
close
from
a
bottle
at
our
octoberfest
hadnt
had
one
since
same
time
last
year
obvious
phenolics
in
the
aroma
with
that
hint
of
caramel
and
chocolate
slight
wheat
tartness
and
then
rounded
off
with
the
coloure
malt
flavours
a
bloody
nice
change
from
the
lighter
weizenbier
was
almost
caramel
colored
with
ok
head
and
ok
lacing
smell
was
very
fruity
not
only
bananas
but
some
citrus
too
taste
matched
the
smell
bread
bananas
and
a
hint
of
citrus
mouthfeel
was
ok
a
bit
girtty
and
there
was
some
sediment
in
the
bottle
drinkability
is
above
average
goes
down
smooth
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
in
the
autumn
not
to
filling
good
with
some
grilled
foods
overall
youve
probably
heard
that
beer
is
liquid
bread
well
this
one
is
liquid
banana
bread
its
really
very
good
and
one
of
my
favorite
dunkel
hefewieizens
but
not
one
that
i
would
drink
all
the
time
only
when
i
am
in
the
banana
mood
it
might
not
be
a
beer
for
every
occasion
but
it
comes
highly
recommended
from
me
500
ml
bottle
slightly
murkybrown
beer
with
a
terrific
tan
head
tight
and
bubbly
very
wheat
filled
aroma
some
toffeeish
malts
nice
flavor
profile
semisweet
milky
almost
maltiness
then
a
good
strong
wheat
mouthful
can
barely
detect
hops
in
the
finish
overall
very
nice
and
well
balanced
very
good
palate
quite
thick
for
the
style
and
a
pleasant
after
taste
good
drinking
beer
drinkability
is
very
high
though
because
it
is
refreshing
as
hell
d
a
drinkable
not
overly
dark
roasted
beer
with
subtle
nuances
in
the
flavor
aromas
and
finish
not
the
best
but
a
a
definite
improvement
over
mass
market
commercial
grocery
store
ive
a
preference
for
stouts
but
this
is
a
nice
change
and
would
go
well
with
a
beef
or
bbq
dish
and
still
hold
its
own
not
my
first
second
or
third
choice
as
an
everyday
brew
but
one
id
grab
given
a
limited
restaurant
beerlist
buy
again
yeah
probably
as
a
change
of
pace
or
definitely
yes
if
on
sale
overall
i
do
not
know
what
else
i
can
say
i
love
all
things
german
and
this
was
no
exception
one
of
the
finest
quality
brews
i
have
had
in
a
very
long
while
i
would
be
happy
to
try
this
one
again
any
day
and
in
fact
will
be
looking
forward
to
having
some
again
very
soon
great
choice
here
and
another
very
solid
offering
pours
a
cloudy
brown
with
orange
edges
thick
off
white
head
forms
eggshell
colour
leaves
a
few
lace
spots
settles
to
a
thin
ring
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
caramel
chocolate
light
vanilla
and
banana
touch
of
yeast
and
spice
taste
is
similar
nice
caramel
and
bready
malts
banana
touch
of
citrus
spices
chocolate
yeasty
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
another
solid
beer
from
weihenstephaner
a
nice
dunkelweiss
thanks
jan
i
could
drink
this
all
night
it
is
a
shame
it
is
so
warm
in
october
this
is
a
perfect
fallwinter
beer
i
was
having
a
big
southern
style
party
with
a
blues
band
and
we
served
this
and
the
brooklyn
pils
the
chocolate
and
banana
nuances
that
came
through
so
valiantly
before
were
toned
down
in
the
taste
but
you
could
smell
them
like
flowers
that
was
odd
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
on
tap
to
see
if
it
was
just
me
500ml
bottle
purchased
from
bauer
wines
in
boston
pours
a
murky
muddy
brown
with
good
head
the
head
does
fade
and
there
is
little
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
overly
strong
but
then
again
i
dont
seem
to
be
smelling
all
that
much
these
days
the
flavour
is
sadly
weak
theres
some
ok
wheatiness
but
it
fades
quicker
than
i
would
like
and
there
isnt
much
in
the
way
of
the
banana
flavours
that
i
like
in
a
good
weizen
that
being
said
this
may
be
one
of
my
first
dunkelweizens
so
perhaps
those
are
different
dark
amber
to
brown
hazy
beer
with
a
foamy
pillowy
head
a
flavorful
banana
with
a
light
hop
smell
refreshing
light
mouthfeel
has
a
similar
taste
to
the
smell
up
front
with
a
bit
more
of
a
caramelized
aftertaste
an
excellent
beer
my
second
favorite
of
the
brewerys
offerings
drinkability
extremely
drinkable
dark
wheat
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
and
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
available
my
personal
standard
for
a
dark
hefeweissbier
just
a
great
beer
just
a
wonderful
allaround
dark
wheat
bier
more
will
find
the
way
into
my
fridge
every
beer
i
have
tried
from
this
brewery
has
been
nothing
short
of
wonderful
overall
it
was
very
smooth
and
drinkable
and
i
can
definitely
see
myself
downing
too
many
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
this
beer
started
off
at
4
25
for
me
but
now
rates
4
4
you
will
see
that
some
of
the
comments
dont
quite
match
up
to
the
score
very
malty
moderately
spicy
and
fruity
completely
delicious
the
second
best
wheat
beer
in
the
world
after
the
regular
hefe
d
this
is
good
stuff
its
refreshing
and
complex
at
the
same
time
and
that
is
the
key
to
drinkability
imo
but
the
only
reason
that
i
didnt
give
this
a
five
is
that
it
is
pretty
damn
sweet
i
think
that
without
big
hop
flavors
high
abv
or
a
little
bit
of
roastiness
beer
like
this
can
get
cloying
after
maybe
two
that
said
this
is
my
second
weihenstephaner
beer
and
my
second
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewer
to
receive
a
score
of
4
5
im
impressed
d
good
no
problems
drinking
this
one
pretty
quickly
though
it
is
nice
to
slow
down
a
little
to
enjoy
the
taste
d
this
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
pretty
drinkable
in
that
it
is
not
too
offensive
but
its
not
nearly
as
flavorful
as
i
was
expecting
none
the
less
it
seems
to
be
a
good
thirst
quencher
a
classic
dunkel
weizen
that
is
absolutely
delicious
this
clearly
outshines
so
many
others
unique
yet
well
within
the
style
another
great
brew
from
this
awesome
brewery
pours
a
murky
mud
puddle
brown
color
with
an
egg
shell
head
that
was
average
but
left
a
nice
cap
once
dissipated
the
smell
is
subdued
but
still
has
distinct
clove
and
banana
characteristics
the
taste
is
of
light
clove
and
banana
the
flavor
are
a
bit
subtle
but
good
a
slight
touch
of
metallic
malt
to
offset
the
sweet
bananaclove
the
feel
is
moderately
bodied
with
a
nice
creamy
texture
nice
and
smooth
very
balanced
finishes
quite
nice
great
dunkel
weisse
not
as
good
as
their
hefe
or
kristel
but
quite
superb
extremely
enjoyable
and
drinkable
dunkel
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
at
5
3
i
could
attempt
to
all
around
great
beer
that
will
turn
me
on
to
try
out
more
of
this
style
a
very
solid
wiezen
especially
on
this
hot
summer
evening
d
overall
a
very
delicious
dunkelweizen
but
it
doesnt
live
up
to
the
hype
i
honestly
think
that
franzikaner
is
superior
regardless
this
is
a
delicious
brew
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
murky
rustorange
color
with
a
glistening
offwhite
bubbly
head
the
smell
is
like
a
typical
hefe
cloves
yeast
slightly
sweet
and
this
one
is
a
bit
bready
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
very
clovey
and
spicy
very
similar
to
weihenstephaners
traditional
hefe
the
mouthfeel
is
full
bodied
with
a
frothy
creamy
carbonation
and
incredibly
smooth
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
another
testament
to
the
quality
of
beer
from
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
drinkability
not
too
sweet
makes
for
easy
drinking
thirst
quenching
brew
i
love
burping
up
that
fine
banana
flavor
bring
on
a
few
more
drinkability
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
wheats
especially
during
the
summer
months
this
one
is
nice
a
little
fuller
than
a
regualr
wheat
four
fantastic
beers
but
just
one
winner
what
a
shame
because
all
these
beers
deserved
a
nomination
the
wei
invite
has
been
wrapped
up
so
check
back
to
see
what
you
missed
good
night
everyone
d
a
nice
beer
but
not
all
that
different
from
their
hefeweizen
a
bit
more
malt
to
show
a
difference
would
have
been
good
still
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
though
so
the
winner
in
my
dunkle
weizen
taste
off
is
definitely
ayinger
ur
weisse
this
one
just
doesnt
have
much
character
while
ayinger
has
a
banana
bread
quality
this
is
just
a
slight
variation
on
the
hefe
weizen
boring
i
want
something
that
i
have
to
chew
not
a
thin
meek
beer
like
this
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
was
redbrown
in
color
and
hazy
the
towering
offwhite
head
had
great
retention
and
left
lots
of
lace
stuck
to
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
fruity
with
banana
dominating
the
taste
was
fantastic
with
fruity
flavors
and
some
spice
the
finish
was
dry
it
was
medium
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
drinkability
was
excellent
this
is
by
far
the
best
dunkel
weizen
i
have
tried
so
far
85
degree
day
cooling
off
as
dusk
approaches
hard
day
working
in
the
yard
perfect
beer
to
end
the
day
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
pours
a
hazy
copper
color
with
a
thick
off
white
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
leans
toward
the
clove
side
of
the
spectrum
there
is
a
nice
thickness
to
the
mouthfeel
the
flavor
also
is
on
the
clove
side
with
banana
being
noticeable
a
fine
beer

d
oh
i
like
this
one
meaty
with
a
very
nice
light
fruity
character
worth
a
try
for
sure
it
had
a
taste
of
nice
yeasty
sweetness
with
banana
flavor
very
filling
it
was
consistently
sweet
and
creamy
and
went
easily
this
dunkelweiss
has
great
flavor
and
isnt
at
all
dumbed
down
i
do
wish
that
dunkelweissbiers
were
more
readily
available
but
oh
well
no
one
makes
a
better
hefe
than
weihenstephaner
those
crazy
germans
but
this
is
my
first
dunkel
pours
a
light
milk
chocolate
with
the
typical
overflowing
yeasty
head
of
a
wheat
beer
the
thick
head
will
stay
for
the
duration
aroma
has
hints
of
banana
and
pie
crust
taste
has
a
peppery
spice
with
a
gum
like
aftertaste
but
the
lemony
hints
the
regular
hefe
has
are
not
here
a
refreshing
beer
that
goes
down
smooth
taste
is
fresh
with
less
cloves
and
bananas
than
the
smell
would
suspect
the
wheat
is
very
much
present
and
the
dark
malts
add
a
nice
biscuity
taste
aftertaste
is
dry
and
refreshing
with
a
very
low
and
almost
nonexistant
hop
presence
drinkability
is
very
good
i
could
drink
this
every
summerday
d
a
very
good
dunkel
impressive
appearance
and
a
very
good
flavor
i
love
helles
hefes
so
i
was
keen
to
hace
a
crack
at
this
poured
into
oz
schooner
glass
and
there
was
a
good
rich
head
which
i
made
overflow
bugger
anyhow
there
was
a
lovely
caramel
wheaty
aroma
which
was
even
more
present
in
the
taste
this
flavour
was
cut
by
a
nice
clovey
stewed
apple
note
which
balanced
off
the
sweeter
taste
not
much
hops
and
the
more
i
drank
the
more
interesting
things
i
tasted
roast
beef
dark
chocolate
its
all
there
but
the
banana
i
like
in
the
hefes
the
mouthfeel
was
nice
and
rich
with
a
full
body
but
rather
sticky
like
a
dessert
the
carbonation
is
perfect
with
continuous
moderate
bead
i
love
this
and
now
have
a
need
for
it
now
wonderful
beer
and
one
of
the
best
dunkel
weizens
ive
had
for
sure
id
definitely
drink
it
again
and
probably
will
soon
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
im
only
dissappointed
that
i
waited
so
long
to
try
it
recommended
pours
a
very
dark
amber
with
a
massive
head
that
takes
several
minutes
to
subside
very
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
aroma
is
sweet
bready
yeast
and
some
fruits
taste
follows
the
aroma
with
a
certain
brown
sugar
taste
to
it
nice
interplay
of
the
sweets
with
the
fruit
mouthfeel
is
very
good
and
beer
is
very
drinkable
you
could
session
this
beer
very
easily
overall
a
good
brew
thats
tastes
much
like
the
name
would
lead
you
to
believe
a
little
sweet
but
still
very
enjoyable
overall
a
good
dark
hefe
definitely
worth
a
try
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
introduce
to
your
friends
who
like
hefes
but
not
dark
beers

yet
another
step
on
the
path
to
great
beer
drinkability
was
also
above
average
perhaps
the
slight
acidity
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
less
quickly
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
cloudy
light
brown
like
fresh
cider
with
a
fluffy
white
head
aromas
of
overlyripe
bananas
walnuts
toasted
bread
cloves
tastes
exactly
how
it
smells
with
an
emphasis
on
the
ripe
bananas
and
a
bit
of
bubblegum
sweetness
toasty
malts
and
wheat
flavors
balance
perfectly
and
the
finish
is
very
dry
very
smooth
unassuming
and
natural
tasting
goes
down
fast
at
first
glance
i
didnt
think
this
beer
would
taste
anything
remotely
like
a
dark
beer
the
appearance
was
brown
at
best
but
after
smelling
it
i
knew
it
was
going
to
fit
to
the
weinstephaner
reputation
of
quality
the
slightly
smokey
smell
that
the
hefeweisen
has
was
present
and
the
dark
wheaty
smells
come
in
right
after
it
great
spicey
mouthfeel
that
i
look
forward
to
trying
again
drinkability
not
bad
d
weihenstephaner
continues
for
me
as
one
of
the
more
over
rated
breweries
out
on
the
market
this
beer
was
good
but
nothing
special
by
a
long
shot
drinkability
i
prefer
their
light
hefeweizen
in
flavor
but
this
is
very
delicious
and
went
well
with
a
reuben
sandwich
drinkability
is
pretty
good
as
well
d
highly
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
this
would
make
a
superb
session
beer
also
a
perfect
brew
for
hot
weather
this
is
the
benchmark
for
this
particular
style
in
my
opinion
bottom
line
plenty
of
flavour
in
this
dunkel
weizen
i
can
easily
recommend
it
thanks
go
out
to
wasatch
for
this
sample
overall
quite
mild
and
smooth
and
a
nice
melding
of
a
darker
beer
with
a
hefeweizen
neither
component
dominates
and
the
result
is
a
nice
highly
drinkable
beer
verdict
one
of
my
favorite
dunkels
but
not
quite
the
top
of
the
list
it
definitely
had
a
ton
of
esters
from
the
fermentation
but
not
quite
as
much
as
others
that
i
would
have
to
give
the
cake
to
but
make
no
mistake
dunkels
dont
get
much
better
this
beers
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
color
with
a
very
thick
creamy
head
has
a
very
fresh
slighty
sweet
malt
smell
tastes
like
the
smell
with
a
hint
of
banana
mouthfeel
is
light
and

was

i
like
this
beer
and
will
drink
this
one
again
notes
would
be
an
excellent
change
up
beer
for
summer
months
recommended
drinking
cloudy
toffeeish
brown
huge
offwhite
head
with
fabulous
lacing
aromas
of
sweet
fruit
not
just
banana
and
clove
soft
mouthfeel
flavors
are
not
too
sweet
yeastiness
that
appears
on
the
back
end
is
interesting
and
not
unpleasant
fine
example
of
the
genre
this
poured
lighter
than
i
expeced
for
a
dunkel
there
was
a
nice
head
which
it
retained
as
i
drank
it
down
the
smell
was
excellent
banana
cloves
with
a
bready
yeast
smell
this
is
how
you
want
a
hefe
to
smell
the
taste
was
musty
and
delicious
a
nice
fine
example
of
the
style
the
yeast
really
shone
through
with
some
nice
malt
undertones
a
very
nice
beer
perhaps
not
suited
to
the
winter
the
beer
has
the
classic
zesty
citrusy
gingery
hefeweizen
aroma
the
color
is
a
hazy
goldtinged
lighttomedium
brown
the
color
is
lighter
than
the
dark
designation
might
suggest
the
beer
pours
with
a
large
amount
of
head
as
is
typical
to
the
style
it
tastes
just
as
it
smells
which
is
a
good
thing
but
whereas
the
aroma
is
powerful
the
flavor
is
mellow
has
a
steady
stream
of
carbonation
when
poured
right
to
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
where
this
really
runs
short
thinner
than
the
frontliners
with
a
higher
carbonation
that
really
adversely
affects
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
an
average
dunkel
compared
to
the
others
nothing
wrong
with
that
just
that
there
are
better
and
worse
choices
to
be
had
very
drinkable
i
still
have
some
hefe
and
korbinian
left
gotta
consider
getting
some
more
of
this
too
all
this
made
for
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
recommended
this
is
high
quality
as
anticipated
and
worth
searching
out
for
any
afficianado
of
german
brew
tough
to
beat
among
dunkels
overall
i
have
to
agree
with
pretty
much
everyone
here
this
is
one
of
the
best
dunkel
weizens
out
there
just
like
their
hefeweissen
this
hits
the
spot
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
and
almost
undoubtably
one
of
the
best
a
great
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
drinkability
certainly
one
of
the
nicer
examples
of
the
style
and
my
favorite
d
very
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
good
not
exceptional
and
drinkability
is
very
high
for
this
style
stylistically
this
is
an
excellent
beer
one
of
the
best
germans
ive
had
and
i
would
consider
it
for
future
purchases
notes
ive
said
it
before
and
this
beer
is
exactly
what
im
talking
about
if
your
going
to
be
a
malt
based
brew
the
malts
must
have
depth
this
brew
has
tremendous
depth
while
still
being
soft
this
brewery
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
excellent
drinkability
its
definitely
worth
a
try
once
but
i
think
theres
better
in
the
style
and
i
probably
wont
try
this
again
this
beer
had
a
creamy
off
white
head
on
top
of
a
cloudy
brown
body
with
hints
of
orange
flashing
around
it
almost
looks
like
a
solid
not
a
liquid
the
nose
has
many
components
spicy
clove
nutmeg
banana
bubble
gum
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
toasted
malt
the
taste
reminds
me
of
banana
bread
there
is
spiciness
from
the
cloves
and
i
am
getting
a
citrus
flavor
in
there
too
it
has
a
light
mouthfeel
making
it
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
an
excellent
dunkel
very
smooth
and
flavorful
with
great
carbonation
also
a
beautiful
beer
its
a
pleasure
just
looking
at
your
13
drank
glass
with
all
that
huge
rocky
lace
sticking
to
the
glass
highly
recommended
in
my
opinion
erdinger
is
a
superior

a
highly
drinkable
hefe

rich
and
creamy

extremely
easy
to

at

abv
and
very
refreshing
my
first
hefe
dunkel
and
its
a
nice
contrast
to
a
hefeweissbier
doesnt
have
that
lemony
thing
going
on
that
most
hefes
seem
to
have
definitely
a
beer
and
style
that
i
will
have
again
another
quality
beer
from
the
folks
at
weihenstephaner
seek
and
enjoy
all
in
all
one
of
my
top
dunkels
a
favorite
to
drink
anytime
anywhere
a
more
assertive
nose
and
longer
finishing
taste
would
earn
it
perfect
scores
pours
with
a
nice
foamy
head
mmm
just
the
right
carbonation
with
a
fruity
nose
good
foamy
mouth
feel
with
a
hint
of
cloves
and
a
fruity
flavor
mixed
in
it
tastes
so
good
i
think
ill
have
another
one
all
i
need
to
go
with
it
is
some
bbq
where
is
the
charcoal
lighter
fluid
enjoy
head
retention
is
good
lacing
isnt
very
strong
and
the
brown
color
is
cloudy
and
a
little
golden
the
smell
is
os
deep
clove
with
a
little
banana
and
a
slight
lemon
backround
the
taste
is
a
little
sweet
metallic
very
clovey
and
a
slight
banana
backround
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
like
a
hefeweizen
should
be
crisp
and
foamy
overall
i
thought
this
beer
was
a
little
metallic
but
i
might
try
it
again
later
very
drinkable
and
flavourful
presentation
packaged
in
a
pint
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pint
tap
glass
in
order
to
conform
to
texas
alcoholic
beverage
laws
the
label
reads
malt
liquor
hazy
deep
caramel
colour
with
a
big
fluffy
beige
head
as
the
foam
subsided
fine
bubbles
clung
to
the
glass
in
clumps
head
retention
was
supported
by
ample
carbonation
all
the
aroma
notes
from
a
hefe
were
there
bready
yeast
cloves
vanilla
with
citrusy
undertones
along
with
mild
caramel
and
a
hint
of
cocoa
the
same
could
be
said
about
the
flavour
theres
a
pleasing
caramel
backbone
that
played
very
well
with
the
hefe
character
and
theres
a
bit
of
dry
cocoa
that
came
out
in
the
finish
very
nice
indeed
the
body
was
on
the
light
side
carbonation
fairly
high
crisp
and
lightly
dry
on
the
palate
i
was
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
really
enjoyed
a
lot
ill
be
picking
more
of
these
up
at
some
point
i
think
great
actually
fantastic
for
style
i
dont
like
what
i
perceive
as
bubblegum
so
much
but
i
think
for
the
style
they
are
how
you
say
spot
on
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
holds
and
laces
well
the
smell
is
very
strong
with
the
wheat
the
taste
mimicks
the
smell
i
expected
more
of
a
roasted
flavor
but
didnt
get
one
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
overall
highly
drinkable
a
great
beer
d
this
would
still
make
a
very
good
session
beer
especially
during
a
weekend
marathon
of
football
games
with
friends
d
definitely
an
excellent
beer
a
little
heavy
for
drinking
more
than
one
but
for
a
single
drink
its
definitely
delicious
light
and
refreshing
a
very
solid
german
dunkel
weizen
and
quite
enjoyable
this
beer
has
well
balanced
flavors
i
couldnt
detect
the
roasty
malts
in
here
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
ill
have
to
revisit
this
one
for
sure
drinkability
this
is
decent
not
great
id
rather
have
something
different
after
one
of
these
a
real
pleasure
a
meal
in
and
of
itself
not
because
its
so
heavy
its
not
its
extremely
drinkable
but
because
its
so
satisfying
and
the
flavors
are
earthy
and
robust
and
completely
utterly
satisfying
topnotch
d
very
mellow
relaxing
beer
so
smooth
so
tasty
and
so
freakin
easy
to
drink
i
could
seriously
dream
about
this
beer
amazing
pours
a
darker
shade
of
brown
with
a
bit
of
redness
to
it
very
large
head
especially
if
poured
with
any
slashing
had
to
wait
some
time
before
i
was
able
to
pour
the
whole
thing
in
definitely
a
matly
nose
most
likely
of
the
toasted
variety
and
also
a
hint
of
brown
sugar
or
something
equally
sweet
taste
is
great
perfect
level
of
carbonation
noticeable
but
not
overpowering
again
the
sweet
brown
sugar
taste
is
back
in
the
middle
of
the
tongue
this
time
with
nut
added
finishes
pleasantly
with
candied
fruits
and
more
clovelike
spices
this
beer
goes
down
very
easy
as
well
if
this
were
more
readily
available
i
would
drink
it
all
the
time
mouthfeel
is
fairly
still
after
the
pour
for
a
hot
day
this
does
surprisingly
well
no
roastiness
very
little
nuttiness
slightest
effervescence
prevents
this
from
being
cloying
and
stops
the
acidity
of
an
overcarbed
hefe
sweet
fruity
juicy
taste
sugary
sweetness
with
a
blend
of
grape
jelly
bananas
and
citrus
refreshing
on
the
palate
yeast
notes
permeate
throughout
easy
to
put
down
thats
for
damn
sure
d
ultimatly
refeshing
a
very
very
drinkable
beir
especially
on
a
hot
day
i
bought
a
bottle
of
this
by
mistake
thinking
i
had
grabbed
two
bottles
of
the
regular
hefe
i
certainly
wasnt
disappointed
in
my
blunder
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
hefe
glass
nice
coloring
a
dark
khaki
almost
and
of
course
hazy
smell
is
incredibly
robust
there
is
a
sweetness
in
the
aroma
that
is
very
difficult
to
describe
and
something
i
havent
really
found
in
any
other
weisse
beer
before
this
one
this
beer
tastes
phenomenal
hints
of
fruit
flavors
and
very
smooth
it
was
a
little
to
easy
to
put
down
a
16
9oz
bottle
in
no
time
if
imports
didnt
cost
as
much
as
they
do
this
would
always
be
in
my
refrigerator
this
is
like
a
light
version
of
the
regular
hefe
cause
it
taste
kinda
watery
all
in
all
get
the
regular
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
cause
it
is
10
times
better
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
burst
of
banana
split
and
yeasty
breadlike
flavors
transitions
to
a
slightly
bitter
finish
with
a
hint
of
clove
extremely
complex
for
a
weiss
this
is
both
an
excellent
value
and
an
excellent
beer
poured
to
a
hazy
milk
chocolate
brown
with
offwhite
head
that
dissipated
quickly
and
little
lacing
aroma
of
malt
nuts
and
chocolate
taste
is
malt
chocolate
and
spice
mostly
clove
could
not
detect
much
wheat
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
have
had
better
hefe
weiss
masterfully
made
by
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
drinkability
is
great
on
a
hot
day
there
is
nothing
like
a
worldclass
weizen
i
completely
recommend
this
its
on
par
with
aventinus
murky
brown
with
a
golden
hue
at
the
bottom
where
the
light
illuminates
it
a
huge
head
cascades
up
to
fill
the
top
of
the
glass
with
whiteness
which
eventually
fades
to
just
a
thin
film
it
has
a
very
yeasty
aroma
it
smells
dark
and
dank
but
a
bit
subdued
the
taste
is
full
of
yeast
imparting
some
subtle
fruity
esters
banana
is
in
the
background
there
is
also
some
brown
sugar
in
the
background
and
maybe
cinnamon
throughout
a
heavy
wheat
tang
presides
little
to
no
hop
bitterness
or
flavor
probably
just
enough
to
cut
the
wheat
and
yeast
it
is
very
soft
and
easy
not
biting
in
any
way
the
mouthfeel
is
full
a
true
german
experience
this
is
5
3
and
goes
down
easy
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
is
very
intriguing
to
me
but
i
do
prefer
the
straight
hefe
i
have
a
feeling
this
bottle
wasnt
the
freshest
specimen
around
and
imagine
that
hurt
it
unfortunately
no
easy
to
read
freshness
date
was
present
overall
a
very
solid
beer
for
summer
drinking
very
drinkable
tasty
looking
brew
pours
a
very
cloudy
copperbrown
color
very
much
looks
like
icedtea
a
huge
three
inch
thick
off
white
head
forms
with
excellent
retention
lots
of
malt
of
yeast
smells
with
hints
of
spicescloves
and
bananas
very
nice
combination
of
wheat
and
malt
flavors
a
little
sweetness
in
there
like
sweet
apple
cider
excellent
mouthfeel
very
light
and
refreshing
way
too
easy
to
drink
a
great
beer
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summers
day
a
must
try
dvery
drinkable
a
beer
to
be
enjoyed
year
round
i
mean
what
do
you
want
to
hear
its
darker
more
rich
smelling
a
bit
more
full
of
floaty
particles
but
man
this
one
sure
does
deliver
this
is
like
a
more
tan
version
of
your
significant
other
its
just
darker
and
better
its
no
less
refreshing
but
it
would
certainly
pair
a
little
better
with
stronger
food
flavors
it
is
really
malt
paradise
i
prefer
mine
chilled
up
and
consumed
in
the
following
manner
since
this
is
not
a
sipping
beer
its
best
to
take
a
giant
swig
every
minute
or
so
until
the
beer
is
gone
repeat
until
empty
or
until
you
start
to
understand
german
this
is
very
solid
dunkel
weizen
definitely
no
lemon
needed
for
this
wonderful
brew
pours
a
deep
copper
color
with
a
large
fizzy
head
the
aroma
consists
of
malt
and
yeast
and
slight
hints
of
banana
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
and
extremely
refreshing
there
is
a
nice
combination
of
yeastbananacocoa
flavors
over
a
nice
malt
backbone
this
is
simply
another
stellar
brew
from
weihenstephaner
if
i
had
to
choose
my
favorite
style
right
now
it
would
be
hefeweizen
and
this
offering
is
not
so
different
a
nice
slightly
darker
version
highly
recommended
i
will
get
this
again
and
again
hard
to
go
wrong
with
the
worlds
oldest
brewery
taste
is
a
biiit
of
a
letdown
after
the
smell
isnt
as
potent
still
good
though
more
of
the
cinnamon
pumpkin
allspice
banana
thing
going
on
just
a
bit
muted
more
subtle
mouthfeel
is
absoluvely
lovely
thick
and
creamy
smooth
really
good
quite
drinkable
perhaps
too
sweet
too
spiced
after
a
while
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
it
really
hits
the
spot
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
excellent
taste
and
malt
concentration
nice
option
pours
a
cloudy
tanbrown
looks
like
aw
cream
soda
very
carbonated
lots
of
lush
head
as
a
hefe
should
be
nose
is
very
yeasty
with
some
nice
malts
and
citrus
taste
follows
as
well
yeast
is
a
bit
overpowering
was
expecting
a
bit
of
balance
from
a
dunkel
this
one
is
very
hefe
and
not
much
else
the
malts
arent
expressed
as
much
as
i
would
like
but
still
very
enjoyable
pours
a
translucent
brown
honey
color
hazy
with
streaming
carbonation
and
a
fizzy
but
lasting
head
surprisingly
no
lace
faint
wheaty
aroma
with
a
hint
of
honey
sweetness
taste
is
quite
mild
wheaty
with
the
same
hint
at
honey
as
in
the
aroma
a
metallic
edge
and
a
late
spiciness
quite
smooth
with
mild
small
bubbled
carbonation
light
to
medium
body
all
in
all
a
small
tasty
beer
poured
a
murky
yellowbrown
color
with
a
frothy
thick
head
that
was
colored
white
huge
bubbles
seemed
trapped
in
the
head
rings
of
lacing
were
left
behind
in
my
weizen
glass
aromas
of
wheat
fresh
bread
grains
bananas
and
cloves
the
taste
was
very
much
like
that
of
a
hefe
with
the
addition
of
caramel
and
breadgrain
flavors
the
fruit
flavors
were
present
throughout
the
session
and
added
depth
in
my
opinion
not
nearly
as
sweet
as
other
beers
ive
had
within
this
style
but
still
sweeter
than
bitter
chewy
texture
with
nice
carbonation
quite
drinkable
malt
flavor
is
prevalent
with
the
slight
bitterness
of
the
hops
just
kissing
the
palate
in
the
finish
in
between
theres
a
flavor
of
doughy
biscuits
slightly
salty
yet
sweet
the
bubblegum
and
lemon
citrus
flavors
floating
on
top
of
the
wheat
malt
mouthfeel
is
undeniably
perfect
smooth
not
cloying
in
the
least
and
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
not
overdone
or
bubbly
like
many
wheat
beers
can
be
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
night
an
exceptional
brew
and
ive
noticed
this
is
becoming
one
of
my
alltime
favorite
styles
drinkability
is
high
i
got
12
a
case
left
and
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
make
it
last
through
the
week
mk
great
smooth
mouth
this
is
an
extremely
easy
drinker
hats
off
the
brewery
hats
off
to
glunz
for
taking
such
good
care
of
this
beer
overall
not
as
robust
in
flavor
as
i
expected
for
a
dunkle
tasted
more
like
a
regular
hefeweizen
still
a
tasty
beer
though
very
refreshing
not
much
to
complain
about
served
in
a
tall
weizen
glass
the
head
reaches
nearly
two
inches
in
thickness
with
amazing
retention
the
color
is
a
hazy
caramel
brown
and
the
head
is
offwhite
aroma
of
citrus
spice
banana
wheat
and
yeast
the
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
and
bready
with
a
lemony
spice
and
bit
of
clove
the
flavor
carries
through
unchanged
into
a
rather
unremarkable
finish
strong
on
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
runs
slightly
thin
alcohol
seems
low
i
found
it
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
but
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
kick
from
the
taste
to
make
it
a
top
notch
selection
id
stick
with
the
original
hefeweissbeer
overall
a
very
very
good
dark
wheat
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
complex
and
pleasing
deep
and
easy
to
drink
weihenstephaner
dunkelweizen
pulls
off
several
seeming
contradictions
to
make
for
an
excellent
drinking
experience
d
exceptional
so
much
flavour
yet
they
go
down
so
easy
draft
at
the
maple
tree
inn
blue
island
il
not
quite
up
to
what
i
hoped
to
find
still
pretty
nice
though
color
is
beerbottle
brown
under
a
fizzy
head
taste
is
sugary
and
kind
of
light
banana
flavor
builds
up
with
not
much
else
to
balance
it
d
i
think
that
i
prefer
the
original
weihenstephaner
hefe
but
this
is
definitely
a
good
beer
get
some
a
classic
offering
from
the
oldest
brewery
in
the
world
a
nice
hefe
quite
possibly
the
best
sandwitch
beer
ever
concocted
im
having
an
early
lunch
soon
on
this
lazy
day
and
i
am
aching
for
sommadis
already
light
hazy
amber
with
a
nice
thic
head
of
pure
white
foam
that
stays
around
aromas
of
clove
spice
banana
and
some
nice
malt
complexity
come
through
hardcore
and
make
this
one
smell
like
wonderful
fresh
german
bread
taste
is
awesome
as
well
very
bready
with
spice
and
fruit
notes
as
well
not
much
hops
but
the
style
calls
for
almost
none
anyways
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
drinkability
is
very
very
very
good
bring
on
the
ham
on
rye
poured
a
dark
very
hazy
brownish
dark
red
with
a
big
foamy
head
of
about
2
and
a
half
inches
smell
is
dark
fruity
malty
slight
green
apple
aroma
faint
banana
and
spicy
yeast
taste
is
a
light
bodied
and
refreshing
blend
of
wheatytart
malt
some
fruit
like
green
apple
sweetness
subtle
hops
phantom
clove
and
banana
and
a
slighty
spicy
yeast
profile
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
a
very
renewing
flavorful
and
thirst
quenching
hefeweissbier
pretty
drinakble
but
i
expected
more
from
this
this
didnt
quite
hit
al
the
notes
more
fruitiness
i
expect
from
this
style
will
try
again
this
summer
wow
this
is
an
interesting
dunkel
weizen
it
reminds
me
of
the
ayinger
urweiss
because
the
dark
munich
malts
really
make
their
presence
known
their
rich
smooth
malt
character
blends
with
the
complex
grainy
malt
character
of
the
wheat
with
spicy
clove
and
other
yeast
notes
balance
the
malts
to
produce
one
of
the
finest
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
wow
overall
this
is
a
good
hefe
i
think
i
like
the
dunkel
hefe
more
than
a
plain
hefe
this
adds
another
dimension
im
happy
that
i
can
get
some
of
these
weihenstephaner
beers
in
my
area
now
i
was
hoping
to
be
blown
away
i
wasnt
but
having
said
that
this
is
still
good
and
towards
to
top
of
the
class
for
style
weihenstephaner
has
made
a
class
beer
here
theres
a
reason
this
is
the
top
rated
dunkel
weizen
in
the
world
because
it
is
d
great
brew
for
a
hot
summers
day
a
very
smooth
drinkable
dunkel
weizen
some
malty
undertones
with
a
pumpkin
spice
flavor
billowing
head
that
lasted
like
some
chunky
clouds
giving
way
on
a
bight
summer
morning
i
would
buy
this
again
im
very
happy
with
weihenstephaners
beers
this
brauerei
is
fantastic
ive
always
had
a
hard
time
getting
hold
of
weihenstephaner
for
whatever
reason
and
thought
that
what
i
had
been
drinking
was
as
good
as
it
can
get
but
i
was
wrong
this
brewery
really
does
make
the
best
hefeweissbiers
in
the
world
not
totally
for
me
not
bad
a
little
too
fruit
sweet
like
for
my
personal
tastes
drinkability
a
very
agreeable
beer
and
a
nice
introduction
to
the
style
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
fans
of
the
weizen
style
i
look
forward
to
trying
additional
beers
of
this
style
this
beer
surprised
me
in
a
positive
way
lots
of
potential
with
food
with
an
alcohol
content
in
the
mid
5s
this
can
be
a
nice
session
beer
on
warm
nights
will
relaxing
on
the
patio
cheers
full
bodied
wheat
characters
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
drinkabilty
simply
put
fantastic
go
out
and
grab
one
of
these
to
bring
home
drinkability
i
have
not
had
a
good
weizen
in
ages
having
this
reminded
me
of
why
they
are
fantastic
light
refreshing
and
airy
and
relatively
low
in
alcohol
this
is
one
good
beer
and
style
too
i
highly
recommend
this
one
overall
a
good
hefe
and
damned
impressive
to
see
i
will
drink
this
beer
again
paired
with
eggs
over
easy
with
9grain
wheat
toast
spiced
with
salt
pepper
and
herbs
de
provence
for
brunch
sehr
gut
not
my
favourite
style
but
would
appear
to
be
a
good
example
a
solid
but
not
overpowering
taste
a
classic
dunkel
i
was
aggresive
with
my
pour
and
ended
up
with
about
7
inches
of
head
in
a
standard
pint
glass
surprisingly
doesnt
look
too
carbonated
cloudy
amber
brew
head
is
slightly
off
white
has
a
wheaty
estery
smell
taste
ofmalt
and
wheat
not
much
elselow
hopped
if
at
all
mouthfeel
isnt
too
bad
drinkability
not
too
bad
a
lot
milder
then
i
thought
it
would
be
not
a
bad
brew
ooooh
my
goodness
everything
this
brewery
makes
is
excellent
they
could
spit
in
a
bottle
cap
it
and
distribute
it
and
i
would
still
rate
it
a
4
theyve
been
at
it
long
enough
sho
they
should
have
it
down
pat
this
beer
has
all
of
the
clove
estery
fruity
bubblegum
creamy
silky
characteristic
in
flavor
and
aroma
that
youd
ever
want
in
a
wheat
beer
but
with
soft
caramel
maltiness
and
a
light
maple
syrup
character
bring
out
some
nuttiness
and
earthiness
the
addiditon
of
ingredients
that
make
this
beer
a
dunkel
never
dominate
the
wheat
character
or
the
yeast
derived
flavors
supurb
finishes
clean
crisp
with
a
mild
and
lasting
sweetness
this
brew
pours
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
abmer
hues
the
head
is
mammoth
and
white
the
aroma
screams
of
cloves
the
taste
is
of
cloves
and
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
dunkelweizen
but
i
still
prefer
franziskaner
d
it
is
missing
a
lot
of
the
depth
of
fruits
and
yeast
characters
that
i
like
in
german
wheat
beers
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
little
maltyness
and
maybe
some
other
characters
to
tone
down
or
balance
the
bubblegum
notes
taste
easy
drinking
the
wheaty
malt
can
become
a
bit
cloying
it
finished
silky
smooth
with
witbier
banana
ester
yeastiness
mixed
along
with
something
salty
to
kill
off
the
sweetness
this
beer
is
fantastic
poured
a
huge
dense
light
brown
head
that
left
puddles
of
lace
as
it
slowly
faded
to
a
film
hazy
cider
looking
beer
with
streams
of
bubbles
rising
along
the
edges
yeasty
aroma
mixed
with
doses
of
lemon
zest
and
banana
aromas
carry
over
into
the
flavor
with
a
dash
of
that
zesty
lemony
wheat
flavor
on
top
solid
yeasty
base
mixes
with
bananas
and
even
a
bit
of
cocoa
soft
light
mouthfeel
thats
almost
crisp
im
a
big
fan
of
the
refreshing
wheat
beers
german
and
belgian
the
cocoa
flavors
along
with
increased
yeasty
flavors
combine
with
traditional
weizen
flavors
to
make
this
one
of
my
favorite
beers
overall
the
fact
that
its
5
and
so
tasty
just
makes
it
all
that
more
amazing
drinkability
3
5
a
solid
brew
all
the
way
around
and
likely
the
best
dunkelweisen
youll
run
into
just
because
it
seems
like
a
style
the
us
hasnt
really
welcomed
yet
theres
nothing
like
a
good
dunkel
weizen
or
a
dunky
beer
as
it
is
usually
known
this
beer
pours
out
a
dull
brown
color
with
a
big
head
the
aroma
is
a
delicious
blend
of
banana
bread
and
chocolate
nutty
malt
flavor
with
a
wheat
tang
and
plenty
of
spice
huge
flavors
of
banana
and
chocolate
too
this
is
an
incredibly
complex
beer
thick
mouthfeel
great
drinkability
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
the
heffeweissbier
but
a
genuinelly
solid
choice
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
german
ale
this
poured
with
a
real
frothy
head
with
a
good
dark
color
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
nothing
displeasing
either
this
had
a
smooth
flavor
with
medium
body
on
the
wheat
with
a
hint
of
malt
to
round
out
the
taste
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
a
dark
hefe
at
least
in
the
case
of
this
beer
seems
to
suit
me
more
than
a
traditional
hefe
definitely
worth
getting
again
and
one
of
the
better
dark
wheat
beers
ive
had
d
it
is
good
but
it
could
be
better
i
will
have
it
some
other
time
but
with
the
elements
presented
for
this
style
i
can
dream
of
a
truly
awesome
dunkelweizen
and
weinstephaner
simply
isnt
it
drinkability
is
very
nice
and
enjoyable
one
of
the
nicest
german
brews
available
i
would
not
rate
this
as
one
of
my
favorite
dunkels
but
it
was
worth
a
drink
i
prefer
the
weihenstephan
hefeweissbier
or
ayinger
urweiss
and
franziskaner
hefeweiss
dunkel
for
other
examples
of
dunkel
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
but
it
just
wasnt
on
par
with
any
other
dunkel
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
with
such
a
positive
review
of
the
original
i
thought
this
one
would
have
something
exciting
to
write
about
nothing
did
it
for
me
it
was
above
average
for
the
style
but
no
characteristics
stood
out
other
than
the
ease
to
finish
maybe
im
not
a
dunkel
fan
but
ill
pass
on
this
one
next
time
all
the
while
this
is
a
very
bright
beer
despite
its
dark
appearance
and
nutty
character
the
generous
carbonation
lends
to
its
overall
zestiness
pours
out
a
deep
dark
burgundyorangish
with
an
almost
chocolate
tone
to
the
color
excellent
head
slightly
offwhite
with
much
better
than
average
retention
and
nice
lacing
smells
of
wheat
yeast
and
typical
citrus
notes
very
good
flavor
with
very
understated
hop
bitterness
and
aggressive
sour
wheat
hitting
the
tongue
first
notable
carbonation
but
balanced
well
finishes
strong
with
the
sour
flavor
contributing
to
the
dry
ending
mouthfeel
is
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
the
style
light
and
refreshing
with
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
extremely
enjoyable
my
only
regret
is
that
i
only
have
this
one
bottle
yeah
baby
this
is
one
of
my
all
time
favorite
styles
and
weihenstephaner
turns
out
a
very
fine
version
plummy
brown
with
a
long
lasting
light
tan
head
the
lacing
is
slippery
and
doesnt
last
long
the
nose
here
is
softly
spicy
and
i
also
get
some
ripe
fruit
notes
this
stuff
is
velvet
on
the
tongue
and
bursting
with
fruity
yeasty
clove
and
banana
goodness
finishes
with
a
drying
winey
slight
sourness
elegent
complex
and
all
around
fine
stuff
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
drinkability
was
quite
nice
i
could
have
this
i
think
i
prefer
the
lighter
hefeweisse
in
general
but
this
is
quite
a
happy
beer
drinkability
and
notes

very
drinkable
there
is
nothing
objectionable
in
the
flavor
whatsoever
this
is
probably
the
best
dark
wheat
beer
i
have
had
and
one
of
the
best
wheat
beers
out
there
period
body
is
medium
with
a
very
slick
and
juicey
mouthfeel
that
is
quite
creamy
and
soft
one
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
this
is
an
awsome
beer
the
taste
is
so
crisp
and
clean
that
i
could
drink
this
stuff
anytime
d
amazing
and
delicious
clearly
an
amazing
beer
overall
with
the
exception
of
the
mouthfeel
this
brew
matches
what
youd
expect
it
to
be
all
the
way
across
the
board
the
look
the
smell
the
taste
all
come
together
to
emphatically
say
this
is
a
dunkelweizen
mostly
bitter
though
with
some
sweet
caramel
notes
also
weighing
heavy
fresh
tartness
of
lemon
and
sweet
clove
back
it
all
up
doesnt
measure
up
to
the
regular
hefe
flavors

the
walnuts
worked
very
well
a
tasty
and
inviting
treat
easy
to

not

just
enough
to

it
out

i
hope
to
get
this
one
again
a

leads
up
to
great
expectations
but
a
rather
odd
flavor
and
rather
watery
and
rough

greatly
detract
from
the
whole
perhaps
its
the
black
walnuts
that
contribute
to
the
weird
taste
experience
and
the
rather
acidic
and
phenolic
character
a
hint
of
a
hefeweizen
styling
and
a
bit
of
a
nutty

pokes

yet
cant
pull
this
brew
together
in

end
interesting
but
not
necessarily
all
that
great
picked
this
up
because
it
was
on
clearance
at
riverside
liquors
in
frederick
i
figured
it
was
interesting
enough
to
be
worth
a
try
good
looking
beer
but
had
a
weird
fizz
when
poured
almost
like
a
soda
instead
of
a
beer
fizzy
head
also
dissipated
quickly
had
me
a
little
worried
but
the
smell
was
excellent
very
interesting
the
taste
was
also
interesting
and
very
good
but
not
awesome
but
feels
a
little
light
and
again
kinda
fizzy
overall
while
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
being
interesting
is
the
best
thing
it
has
going
for
it
while
i
enjoyed
it
i
will
not
be
swinging
back
by
to
grab
any
more
of
these
despite
the
good
price
o
rated
on
the
fact
i
think
it
hits
the
style
and
the
novelty
of
recipe
have
had
this
before
and
enjoyed
it
this
taste
confirmed
my
like
of
the
beer
and
the
rating
follows
i
have
always
wanted
nut
browns
to
be
more
nutty
to
actually
taste
like
nuts
and
a
dark
lager
is
just
a
fabulous
format
to
finally
find
a
beer
that
tastes
like
real
nuts
a
hazy
dark
brown
beer
with
a
short
inch
of
tan
head
without
a
lot
of
retention
the
beer
appears
quite
thick
for
a
lager
and
there
is
some
yeast
sediment
present
it
smells
amazing
like
fresh
roasted
walnuts
or
fresh
baked
dark
chocolate
walnut
cookies
as
it
has
a
nice
dark
german
grain
complex
in
there
too
and
a
hint
of
bakers
chocolate
from
the
roast
the
walnuts
are
by
far
the
dominant
flavor
adding
an
earthy
and
semisweet
protein
complex
that
has
notes
of
vanilla
and
tree
bark
as
well
as
a
general
sweetness
akin
to
fresh
maple
sap
before
its
boiled
down
into
syrup
its
perfect
for
spring
sturdy
enough
for
cold
weather
no
doubt
but
jovial
enough
to
remind
us
all
that
we
have
almost
made
it
through
winter
how
to
describe
the
flavor
of
a
walnut
thats
very
tough
if
youve
never
had
a
walnut
personally
but
i
think
this
beer
showcases
that
unique
flavor
brilliantly
while
still
being
a
really
cool
beer
underneath
the
lager
yeast
is
bready
and
adds
to
that
cookie
feel
while
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
for
its
vanilla
sugar
sweetness
throughout
fuller
medium
body
and
a
smooth
texture
maybe
a
little
undercarbonated
but
i
like
the
way
this
sits
in
my
mouth
and
stomach
extremely
satisfying
a
memorable
brew
perennial
is
on
a
roll
and
thats
the
beauty
in
these
classic
styles
they
carry
so
much
variety
in
taste
even
though
the
beer
may
be
lighter
in
alcohol
and
body
than
were
used
to
but
thats
its
charm
thats
its
intrigue
and
thats
its
curiosity
perennial
ales
takes
full
advantage
of
true
german
dunkel
flavor
but
with
their
own
americanized
surprise
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
wispy
offwhite
head
that
fades
quickly
and
has
some
perimeter
stickiness
the
nose
is
walnut
banana
bread
but
is
more
banana
than
walnut
the
taste
is
bready
sweetness
upfront
followed
by
a
slightly
bitter
walnut
skin
and
alcohol
the
beer
feels
medium
bodied
with
rich
nutty
malty
sweetness
and
a
lingering
bite
that
doesnt
seem
to
sit
heavy
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
has
a
distinct
and
subtle
walnut
presence
i
think
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
the
bottlegrowler
price
and
i
plan
on
getting
more
next
week
poured
from
a
bomber
into

flavors

tangy

with

cream
highlights
and
some

pretty
layered

the
palate
lighter
bodied
but
smooth
providing
a
crisp
finish
to
a
beer
that
is
almost
velvety
and
light
in
mouth
the
aftertaste
is
more
of
the
tangy
sweet
with
caramel
and
toffee
blending
together
very
flavorful
and
tasty
beer
o
an
interesting
take
on
the
style
the
walnuts
really
kind
of
take
over
the
overall
profile
of
the
beer
and
adds
that
extra
layer
to
the
dunkel
just
a
shame
that
i
would
like
to
see
the
beers
base
come
through
more
which
would
help
this
remind
me
closer
to
a
dunkel
than
it
is
more
brown
alelike
to
me
o
nice
seasonal
should
have
came
out
when
the
leaves
are
falling
on

trees
overall
bad
no
one
else
thinks
this
is
bad
but
its
bad
seems
a
bit
off
for
the
style
drinkable
enough
but
flawed
i
will
have
to
keep
an
eye
on
freshness
dates
with
this
brewery
from
here
on
this
6
month
old
beer
has
not
held
up
me
thinks
i
liked
piney
rivers
take
on
this
better
by
quite
a
bit
o
this
beer
doesnt
taste
like
your
average
dunklweizen
and
seems
a
little
reminiscent
of
a
brown
ale
with
its
flavors
of
nutty
malts
it
is
definitely
very
interesting
a
wonderful
dunkel
more
on
the
light
side
with
the
fruit
and
nuttiness
instead
of
the
deep
roast
of
the
traditional
german
ones
very
drinkable
o
overall
i
thought
this
sounded
interesting
and
thought
it
worked
really
well
as
youd
expect
there
is
a
ton
of
walnut
in
the
nose
and
taste
mixing
nicely
with
the
roasted
and
toasted
malts
worth
checking
out
would
have
it
again
good
one
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
without
a
high
abv
id
drink
this
again
but
i
feel
it
would
be
better
suited
for
that
evening
when
the
leaves
first
start
to
fall
off
the
trees
side
notes
its
better
than
the
banana
walnut
bread
i
made
this
morning
my
first
intro
to
dunkelweizen
and
it
wont
be
my
last
overall
a
very
tasty
and
inventive
take
on
the
german
dunkelweizen
certainly
not
traditional
but
plenty
good
enough
to
be
worth
a
go
even
for
german
beer
purists
id
say
perennials
first
foray
into
german
styles
is
a
pretty
good
success
o
a
very
fresh
and
flavorful
seasonal
offering
from
a
new
brewery
to
me
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
their
offerings
if
i
can
find
them
as
a
lover
of
the
dunkelweiss
style
i
routinely
keep
a
keg
of
franziskaner
dunkel
in
my
beer
cooler
and
many
bottles
of
ayinger
urweisse
in
my
fridge
this
is
the
first
american
craft
version
of
dunkelweiss
which
rivals
the
bavarian
originals
and
even
surpasses
them
in
quality
a
must
try
if
you
can
find
it
and
like
the
style
if
only
bwd
was
more
readily
available
fuller
medium
body
decent
carbonation
creamy
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
how
do
you
effectively
prevent
boring
people
with
a
traditional
style
evidently
you
walnut
the
crap
out
of
it
i
was
into
this
but
i
could
see
some
not
enjoying
it
quite
as
much
dark
almost
cola
like
brown
with
haze
moderate
tan
tinted
head
scent
brings
lots
of
caramel
with
some
notes
of
roasted
nuts

some

is
quite
bold
with

the
star
and
an
adequate
amount
of

some
earthy
and
grassy
hops
strengthens
at
the
end
of
the
sip
medium
bodied
light
in
carbonation
another
decent
beer
from
perennial
overall
a
solid
brew
in
general
it
is
a
pretty
sweet
beer
but
not
in
a
cloying
way
it
is
nicely
balanced
and
interesting
enough
for
me
to
want
to
finish
the
bottle
o
i
was
surprised
by
the
light
feel
and
flavor
i
was
expecting
something
chewey
given
appearance
and
smell
d
enjoyed
all
the
perennial
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
interesting
twist
on
the
style
overall
interesting
fairly
tasty
wish
it
had
a
bit
more
of
the
walnuts
but
otherwise
fairly
tasty
and
well
done
and
quite
unique
o
overall
this
was
a
cool
beer
glad
i
got
to
try
it
nice
nuttiness
quite
nice
and
tasty
rather
unique
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
beige
head
no
visible
lacing
a
pleasing
aroma
with
notes
of
banana
cocoa
subtle
spice
and
earthiness
opens
with
subtle
toffee
and
cocoa
joined
by
nutty
banana
bread
and
finishes
smooth
with
mild
earthiness
lighterside
of
medium
bodied
the
level
of
carbonation
is
perfect
pleasant
but
not
in
a
way
that
disrupts
the
silky
smooth
mouthfeel
the
black
walnuts
really
add
a
new
dimension
to
an
excellent
dunkelweizen
base
another
excellent
brew
from
perennial
they
have
yet
to
disappoint
o
liked
this
one
alot
one
of
the
most
flavorful
dunkels
ive
had
in
a
long
time
would
have
again
a
well
done
dunkelweizen
although
i
wish
the
flavor
were
nuttier
not
a
style
i
have
often
so
it
was
nice
for
a
change
up
even
if
it
isnt
anything
innovative
the
beer
pours
a
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
toffee
and
walnuts
two
notes
that
really
go
well
together
in
this
case
the
flavor
is
very
similar
i
get
a
lot
of
sweet
toffee
and
brown
sugar
notes
with
some
walnuts
and
chocolate
also
thrown
in
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
well
done
and
very
enjoyable
o
i
was
impressed
by
this
one
and
would
love
to
have
it
again
recommended
if
you
can
get
it
nice
to
see
another
up
and
coming
brewery
available
in
chicago
poured
into
goose
island
wine
glass
appearance
is
somewhat
murky
and
brown
minimal
head
upon
pour
with
no
retention
the
nose
features
familiar
notes
of
dunkelweizen
plenty
of
orange
and
coriander
the
walnut
comes
through
in
subtle
waves
as
it
warms
in
the
glass
hints
at
molasses
and
brown
sugar
present
as
well
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
somewhat
sweet
up
front
with
lots
of
ripe
fruits
and
some
spice
the
walnut
provides
a
delicate
nutty
finish
but
definitely
hangs
in
the
background
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
with
medium
to
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
unique
twist
on
the
style
it
seems
that
brews
that
add
nuts
are
hit
in
mis
as
far
as
the
nut
presence
is
concerned
the
walnut
is
evident
but
it
did
take
some
time
to
discover
overall
worth
a
try
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
with
a
foamy
khaki
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
drip
down
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
brown
sugar
caramel
and
toffee
taste
is
the
same
with
some
mild
nutty
flavors
and
a
slight
tartness
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
better
smell
than
taste
in
my
opinion
the
walnuts
used
in
this
one
are
pretty
subtle
too
o
this
was
surprisingly
good
i
was
apprehensive
about
black
walnuts
in
a
dunkel
but
it
was
really
good
pours
a
black
color
14
inch
head
of
an
offtan
color
good
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
hops
sweet
malt
slight
roasted
malt
hint
of
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
wheat
fits
the
style
of
a
dunkelweizen
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
hops
slight
alcohol
sweet
malt
roasted
malt
hint
of
sourness
and
a
hint
of
wheat
overall
good
appearance
body
and
blend
o
an
alright
beer
overall
with
some
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
unfortunately
they
dont
mesh
very
well
but
its
still
a
drinkable
beer
pours
deep
brown
almost
black
smells
sweet
with
some
caramel
malts
sugary
fruits
and
a
little
nutty
taste
starts
off
with
lots
of
caramel
malts
that
move
into
darker
fruits
grapes
and
plums
a
little
sweet
nuttiness
and
sweet
malt
is
on
the
finish
really
nice
rich
flavor
profile
mouth
is
full
bodies
and
smooth
pretty
solid
dunkel
the
walnut
adds
a
nice
layer
of
complexity
to
a
pretty
solid
beer
light
to
medium
mouthfeel
that
is
very
drinkable
another
great
beer
from
a
local
brewer
looking
forward
to
trying
more
from
perennial
overall
a
pretty
good
refreshing
and
delicious
dark
brew
o
a
wonderful
dunkel
that
was
probably
my
favorite
of
the
day
at
the
brewery
the
walnuts
are
at
a
perfect
level
in
this
beer
and
they
really
help
balance
the
sweetness
excellent
stuff
overall
not
egregiously
over
the
best
by
date
but
is
probably
a
lesser
beer
than
what
was
initially
brewed
having
said
that
i
didnt
find
much
to
think
this
is
a
much
better
brew
when
fresh
ive
had
dunkels
way
out
of
freshness
date
with
significantly
more
flavor
than
this
if
i
ever
get
the
chance
to
rereview
with
a
fresher
sample
though
i
find
it
my
due
diligence
to
do
so
really
great
that
tin
man
got
the
official
beer
of
star
trek
taste
is
surprisingly
toasty
and
malty
with
plenty
of
fruit
undertones
and
a
spicy
sharp
rye
malt
character
seems
to
be
pretty
faithful
to
the
style
but
i
had
a
tough
time
choking
this
one
down
with
all
the
sweetness
and
spice
overwhelming
my
palate
poured
into
a
dogfish
head
pint
glass
pours
a
medium
to
dark
bronze
amber
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
to
patchy
foam
and
a
ring
around
the
glass
nice
aroma
of
caramel
malt
rye
brown
sugar
hints
of
clove
flavor
follows
dominated
by
caramel
malt
syrup
light
rye
sourness
hints
of
clove
and
hops
starts
semisweet
and
finishes
drier
and
a
bit
starkly
with
residual
sharp
rye
and
hits
of
hop
bitterness
medium
bodied
with
a
hint
of
creaminess
i
can
actually
see
klingons
drinking
this
it
has
enough
malt
and
character
to
not
seem
like
some
weak
creatures
beer
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
rye
the
aroma
leans
towards
a
roggenbier
but
the
flavor
is
solidly
in
dunkelweizen
territory
as
either
its
ok
not
amazing
as
a
klingon
ale
a
perhaps
a
bit
thin
and
tame
but
acceptable
quite
drinkable
and
a
nice
can
and
i
dont
say
that
about
every
alien
beer
overall
this
feels
more
like
a
roggenbier
than
a
dunkelweizen
but
it
does
contain
elements
of
both
it
doesnt
have
enough
delicious
bananaandclove
to
be
a
really
great
dunkelweizen
but
there
are
rye
elements
here
that
work
well
it
is
bready
and
hearty
to
be
sure
which
im
sure
would
appeal
to
klingon
sensibilities
i
suppose
that
the
blending
of
styles
is
de
rigueur
of
late
and
german
ones
despite
their
entrenched
laws
are
fair
game
on
this
side
of
the
pond
here
we
have
a
roggenbierassaulted
dunkelweizen
one
where
the
invading
rye
more
or
less
eclipses
the
native
wheat
and
adds
insult
to
injury
by
propping
up
a
ghost
of
the
clove
and
banana
esters
yup
from
what
i
know
about
this
part
of
star
trek
lore
that
seems
about
right
taste
is
pretty
much
like
the
smell
i
would
have
never
guess
this
is
a
wheat
beer
tilts
more
towards
a
weak
brown
i
found
it
a
little
thin
on
the
mouth
a
little
more
carbonation
would
be
nice
i
probably
wouldnt
have
again
a
star
trek
collectors
item
and
thats
all
poured
into
tulip
glass
one
finger
head
medium
carbonation
smell
of
malt
and
minerally
taste
is
sweet
but
not
crazy
malty
dry
and
subtle
bitterness
it
was
ok
picked
this
up
in
a
22
because
it
is
a
style
i
like
and
was
at
a
decent
price
so
worth
a
try
excellent
appearance
and
decent
smell
but
then
the
taste
did
not
follow
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
that
i
enjoyed
drinking
but
would
not
likely
buy
again
mmmm
nice
dark
murky
creamy
bitter
brings
out
the
best
of
both
parmigiano
reggiano
and
the
dunkelweisen
characteristics
as
a
perfect
matching
set
wanted
to
try
it
with
some
dry
sharp
white
cheddar
but
there
was
none
in
the
house
tonight
yea
its
december
yea
it
snowed
most
of
today
and
yea
wheat
beer
is
fashionably
way
out
of
season
right
now
but
i
have
a
special
fetish
for
a
wheat
any
day
of
the
year
gimme
that
light
easy
drinking
dark
wheat
stuff
and
ill
drink
it
as
happily
as
any
other
beer
winter
or
summer
im
gonna
visit
this
brewery
and
get
some
more
of
neshaminy
creeks
good
stuff
in
me
on
the
fuller
end
of
medium
body
with
a
prominent
zesty
clove
presence
up
front
but
again
theres
an
artificial
chemicallike
flavor
coming
in
midpalate
that
throw
things
off
a
bit
its
not
as
offensive
as
in
the
nose
but
it
takes
away
from
the
spice
banana
bread
and
sweet
malts
the
bread
and
banana
flavors
stand
out
more
than
in
the
nose
as
do
the
sweet
chocolate
malt
notes
sweet
chocolate
with
caramel
toffee
and
biscuit
again
the
metallic
solvent
like
character
shows
up
in
the
finish
lingering
a
bit
after
the
swallow
overall
this
beer
has
some
decent
flavor
but
its
buried
underneath
a
mess
of
other
things
that
dont
work
well
for
the
style
rather
nice
on
the
lighter
side
of
being
medium
bodied
like
the
hefe
by
neshaminy
lots
of
banana
notes
through
out
really
does
taste
like
a
chocolate
dipped
banana
in
a
good
bright
effervescence
that
really
break
the
body
up
slightly
medicinal
finish
faint
sweetness
some
bready
notes
a
pretty
complex
low
abv
beer
balanced
and
clean
on
the
back
end
unlike
the
hefe
chocolate
and
caramel
notes
all
blend
together
into
one
nice
concise
and
somehow
refrshing
sip
pretty
good
a
little
bit
of
burnt
toast
comes
into
play
at
times
that
doesnt
blend
as
well
but
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
lingering
banana
and
hearty
breads
in
the
mouth
update
picked
up
growler
and
bottles
of
the
2014
release
the
mouthfeel
is
not
as
thick
and
rich
as
the
2013
the
aroma
and
taste
are
similar
but
less
sweet
and
dense
the
dark
fruits
are
missing
this
year
and
it
is
closer
to
a
bavarian
dunkelweizen
in
density
and
flavor
the
sourness
now
dominates
the
palate
and
the
malty
sweetness
takes
a
backseat
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
are
still
bold
which
should
please
the
trendy
ipa
crowd
overall
not
a
bad
dunkel
and
quite
easy
drinking
fairly
tasty
and
well
worth
a
try
muddy
brown
in
color
and
murky
with
an
orangish
hue
poured
with
a
billowy
white
foam
with
good
staying
power
that
slowly
reduced
to
a
wispy
cap
sweet
banana
aroma
is
dominant
with
hints
of
earthy
grain
and
dark
bread
in
the
background
medium
bodied
a
bit
syrupy
with
tight
tangy
carbonation
through
the
middle
sweet
banana
flavor
throughout
with
peppery
spices
in
tow
that
peak
with
a
tangy
bite
through
the
middle
a
pleasant
spicy
hop
flavor
ushers
in
the
end
as
this
finishes
with
a
sweet
slightly
yeasty
slighty
spicy
aftertaste
a
lot
of
dark
candy
syrup
flavor
seems
kind
of
artificial
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
one
purchase
with
caution
a
bottle
of
this
was
shared
this
weekend
among
friends
and
was
explosively
carbonated
this
smells
and
tastes
nothing
like
a
dunkelweizen
all
mineral
character
and
fruity
sourness
sad
to
say
that
my
only
experience
with
this
brewery
has
been
2
bottles
of
infected
mess
overall
i
would
call
this
beer
good
i
would
recommend
it
to
try
i
would
like
to
see
what
its
like
on
draught
and
warmer
but
its
a
little
flat
i
give
it
a
3
5
out
of
5
o
not
bad
there
are
better
examples
out
there
but
id
drink
this
again
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
the
abv
is
only
5
4
from
the
hints
of
alcohol
heat
i
would
have
thought
it
was
more
the
taste
is
good
with
nice
yeast
which
is
dominant
and
has
a
tropical
taste
similar
to
ripe
banana
yet
not
overly
sweet
with
subtle
grain
toastiness
and
light
spicing
the
overall
impression
is
this
is
a
pretty
decent
wheat
with
some
good
dunkle
characteristics
true
to
the
style
in
general
lightly
hazed
brown
in
color
minimal
spots
of
tan
froth
scent
brings
light
yeast
bread
heavy
clove
and
brown
sugar
taste
follows
suit
really
sweet
for
the
style
lots
of
spice
and
yeast
notes
without
much
flavor
depth
way
too
carbonated
and
prickly
not
too
into
this
one
dark
ruddy
brown
in
color
hazy
with
a
tall
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
spritzy
twangy
and
refreshing
clove
baking
bread
some
wheat
and
citrus
rind
the
beer
is
not
as
sweet
as
expected
it
has
the
refreshing
zest
that
i
expected
but
is
maybe
tilted
a
bit
too
far
toward
sour
nice
try
though
and
very
drinkable
medium
in
body
this
would
be
nice
served
cold
on
a
very
hot
day
my
initial
pour
resulted
in
just
over
a
finger
of
deeptan
head
but
it
faded
to
wisps
in
the
short
time
that
it
took
me
to
type
the
above
verbiage
wow
color
was
a
slightly
hazy
iced
teabrown
i
definitely
got
notes
of
banana
and
clove
from
the
nose
so
kudos
for
truth
in
advertising
mouthfeel
was
medium
and
it
tasted
of
banana
and
clove
with
the
wheat
adding
a
slight
tartness
to
the
mix
the
caramel
seemed
to
be
lost
on
me
however
finish
was
semidry
with
the
clove
esters
really
leading
the
pack
it
was
not
bad
nor
was
it
great
i
am
still
not
totally
sold
on
their
lineup
of
beers
but
i
am
willing
to
keep
knocking
them
back
one
by
one
overall
a
decent
dunkelweizen
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
a
bit
refreshing
good
amount
of
dark
fruit
complimented
by
a
touch
of
banana
flavor
and
a
nice
fluffy
texture
finishes
with
a
bit
spicy
clove
and
a
touch
dry
with
a
lingering
sweetness
a
bit
of
alcohol
heat
for
some
reason
long
finish
with
carbonation
that
sticks
to
the
gums
a
nice
sweet
beer
with
a
bit
of
balance
simple
flavors
that
go
really
well
together
i
like
it
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
spices
taste
is
of
wheat
spice
a
bit
f
caramel
smooth
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
refreshing
beer
probably
better
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
its
flavor
starts
out
rather
decent
but
in
the
end
with
the
fading
of
much
of
the
sweetness
it
leaves
a
little
too
dry
yeasty
and
spiced
flavor
on
the
tongue
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
flavor
but
i
feel
like
it
could
finish
a
touch
sweeter
a
nice
interpretation
of
the
style
for
now
its
ok
but
nothing
special
o
if
is
not
that
much
carbonation
in
the
tastethis
could
more
then
decent
a
very
pleasant
light
weight
dunkelweizen
refreshing
and
light
on
spices
but
still
quite
malty
a
pretty
mediocre
dunkelweizen
one
that
i
wont
be
having
again
their
hefeweizen
is
better
though
it
smell
of
nuts
and
fruits
and
great
fresh
wheat
fields
its
taste
is
just
as
wonderful
with
even
more
malt
along
with
the
wheat
and
nutty
fruits
it
goes
down
smooth
and
leaves
you
wanting
another
every
time
if
you
want
a
dark
wheat
this
is
one
of
the
best
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
not
bad
but
farm
from
the
best
a
good
allround
hefe
dr
horribly
priced
though
in
fairness
i
purchased
it
at
an
airport
but
sweet
bejaysus
lads
leave
this
one
where
it
belongs
on
the
shelf
m
thin
to
medium
body
carb
was
good
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
its
appearance
poured
with
a
huge
foamy
frothy
thick
fluffy
cream
colored
head
that
lasts
a
long
time
and
good
lace
color
at
first
is
a
copper
amber
aroma
is
very
mild
with
malt
a
bit
roasty
and
yeast
not
much
else
flavor
is
like
aroma
and
i
wonder
why
they
even
bothered
body
and
carbonatoin
are
ok
finish
is
like
flavor
and
short
forgettable
pours
a
beautiful
head
of
dough
bread
mass
cloudy
caramel
color
nose
is
floral
mild
pepper
citrus
and
burnt
coriander
palate
of
gritty
burnt
malt
and
coriander
dry
as
ever
mild
wheat
malt
sweet
bitter
green
orange
peel
finish
and
wheat
husk
sharp
not
particularly
broad
for
a
dunkelweiss
malt
properties
fall
short
yet
the
dryness
is
quite
appealing
a
palate
cleanser
if
anything
notes
fair
dark
weizen
with
a
solid
balance
overall
a
beatiful
beer
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
d
not
as
drinkable
as
their
regular
hefe
but
this
one
is
still
pretty
good
could
make
for
a
nice
session
beer
overall
a
no
frills
winner
here
very
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
and
at
5
abv
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
and
i
would
definitely
pick
it
up
again
this
is
the
second
schoefferhofer
weizen
ive
had
and
both
of
them
have
been
top
notch
drinkability
a
great
clean
session
beer
for
any
hefeweizen
lover
went
great
with
the
paprika
chips
i
bought
with
it
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
id
go
so
far
as
to
say
a
standard
for
the
style
everything
i
want
from
a
dark
hefeweizen
is
in
there
drinkability
is
not
bad
a
little
watery
and
a
bit
weak
in
character
but
still
a
drinkable
dunkel
overall
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
body
refreshing
without
the
depth
of
a
good
dunkel
weizen
drinkability
a
fantastic
beer
with
complex
flavors
that
develop
late
and
leave
you
wanting
another
glass
just
to
sample
them
all
again
a
standout
wheat
malt
and
great
hop
balance
abv
and
smoothness
of
the
brew
make
it
even
easier
to
have
another
an
exceptional
dunkel
weizen
everything
about
this
beer
was
good
as
i
will
endeavor
to
describe
the
appearance
was
rusty
brown
hazy
darker
than
other
dunkel
weizens
i
had
and
well
appreciated
by
me
the
aroma
had
the
necessary
bananascloves
but
also
included
some
other
interesting
fruits
such
as
plum
and
raisin
it
was
actually
a
little
porty
in
flavor
not
really
common
for
weizens
but
very
nice
the
taste
was
awesome
it
contained
all
the
fruits
described
in
the
aroma
just
richly
fruity
and
a
little
bready
the
mouthfeel
was
thick
and
coating
and
the
drinkability
was
high
especially
considering
how
filling
the
beer
seemed
i
highly
recommend
you
take
a
stab
at
this
if
you
see
it
it
was
mighty
nice
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
soft
carbonation
but
this
isnt
the
easiest
for
me
to
drink
with
such
an
overwhelming
presence
of
cloves
taste
is
dry
banana
bit
of
maltyness
and
a
moderate
to
low
bitterness
however
bit
yeasty
somehow
missing
the
fullness
of
a
good
darkweizen
and
having
a
watery
mouthfeel
refreshing
and
easy
drinkable
for
shure
but
bit
mainstream
and
missing
something
pours
a
cloudy
dark
copper
under
a
beige
1
5
finger
head
with
good
consistency
and
decent
retention
but
very
few
lace
spots
theres
a
nice
strong
citrus
and
spice
nose
with
just
a
hint
of
caramel
to
smooth
things
out
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
mild
perhaps
watery
taste
of
yeast
yeast
and
more
yeast
cilantro
is
also
here
the
hps
are
very
subdued
but
leave
a
slight
dryness
late
in
the
aftertaste
a
nice
solid
brew
albeit
unspectacular
this
dunkel
weizen
poured
a
cloudy
coffe
brown
color
with
creamy
tan
foam
that
persisted
the
smell
was
wheat
mild
banana
and
a
touch
of
caramel
the
taste
was
malty
with
hints
of
banana
banana
cream
pie
and
caramel
with
notes
of
yeast
and
a
tangy
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
slightly
creamy
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
nice
and
easy
to
drink
dunkel
hefeweizen
first
impressions
are
much
what
youd
expect
hefe
aroma
of
banana
a
little
hoppy
slight
sweetness
but
once
its
in
your
mouth
it
is
evident
that
the
dark
malt
has
added
a
caramel
flavour
that
has
overtaken
what
little
banana
flavour
is
there
nice
but
could
do
with
more
flavour
quite
nice
very
quaffable
sweetish
banana
and
chocolate
flavour
very
very
smooth
and
even
a
bit
light
still
theres
enough
german
wheat
character
banana
clove
and
dark
malt
character
choccaramel
to
keep
you
interested
not
the
best
dunkle
weiss
but
very
solid
by
anyones
standard
not
a
bad
drop
a
good
spritzy
dunkel
weisse
that
makes
up
in
refreshment
what
it
lacks
in
depth
murky
copperbrown
with
fluffy
head
that
doesnt
last
yeasty
aroma
with
hints
of
pear
and
candy
caramel
there
is
not
much
malt
presence
but
it
slowly
asserts
itself
as
the
beer
warms
fruity
initially
spiky
spritzy
a
very
wet
quenching
finish
smooth
easily
drinkable
with
a
slight
tint
of
metal
deep
down
the
only
off
quality
while
not
as
big
and
robust
as
some
dunkel
weisses
its
still
very
tasty
the
adventure
continues
rjt
o
has
a
pretty
good
all
around
flavor
well
balanced
and
pretty
tasty
this
was
a
little
bit
surprising
to
me
i
liked
the
fact
the
michelob
tried
appealing
to
the
craft
beer
nuts
out
there
with
their
attempts
of
putting
these
types
of
beers
out
the
dunkelweizen
is
probably
the
best
of
the
series
its
got
a
muddy
brown
color
with
a
pretty
nice
size
head
in
it
the
aromas
of
wheat
and
clove
billow
from
the
foam
the
taste
is
a
little
light
but
it
still
has
enough
to
stand
out
its
also
got
some
earth
and
dark
fruity
flavors
in
there
too
oh
the
michelob
dunkel
probably
their
best
offering
this
beer
pours
a
pretty
thick
dark
hazelnut
brown
with
a
light
cream
colored
head
which
laced
the
glass
the
aromas
are
not
too
shabby
for
the
style
its
a
ton
of
banana
bread
and
spice
the
yeast
is
out
of
this
world
the
taste
too
for
the
style
pretty
solid
its
a
lot
of
banana
bread
super
yeasty
with
good
spice
this
beer
drinks
very
very
thick
its
too
thick
after
two
of
these
i
feel
like
i
ate
two
loaves
of
banana
bread
its
a
little
over
the
top
for
the
style
though
this
isnt
too
shabby
overall
a
very
decent
offering
and
probably
the
best
of
the
night
i
really
liked
what
they
did
with
this
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
but
lacking
body
and
watered
down
as
it
got
warmer
in
the
glass
the
more
flavors
i
could
taste
the
warmer
the
dunkelweisse
the
more
the
flavors
very
good
dunelweizen
d
although
this
is
a
good
tasting
wheat
which
really
no
off
flavors
or
mouth
feel
characteristics
after
drinking
a
few
of
these
one
night
i
found
it
to
be
rather
filling
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
and
kind
of
boring
this
brew
was
touted
as
a
decent
interpretation
by
some
but
i
disagree
had
a
bottle
of
this
with
a
buddy
of
mine
last
night
great
pour
and
appearance
but
everything
else
was
terrible
this
must
have
been
a
bad
batch
because
the
yeast
was
stuck
to
the
side
in
a
big
clump
and
was
as
black
as
night
every
single
bottle
was
this
way
horrible
taste
and
smell
ill
need
to
try
another
in
the
future
that
isnt
tainted
when
pouring
this
beer
it
pours
out
a
nice
dark
color
that
has
a
decent
head
with
some
lacing
and
decent
retention
the
smell
is
of
a
banana
and
cloves
when
drinking
this
beer
i
taste
some
bananas
and
cloves
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
and
some
wheat
this
beer
has
a
nice
smooth
medium
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
i
would
highly
recommend
this
beer
for
anyone
that
loves
a
good
beer
sinkability
this
didnt
taste
anything
at
all
like
a
dw
d
a
like
the
aftertaste
quite
a
bit
but
the
initial
sweetness
is
a
little
hard
to
take
i
can
appreciate
the
effort
but
just
a
little
off
the
mark
but
all
in
all
its
a
very
quaffable
beer
it
may
not
have
all
the
character
that
the
top
craft
beers
have
but
it
has
all
the
drinkability
taste
begins
slightly
sweet
turning
quickly
to
a
rather
pleasant
smoky
flavor
combined
with
a
rather
unfortunate
hops
blend
the
flavor
then
collapses
into
what
i
can
only
describe
as
a
chemically
burnt
mess
could
easily
throw
a
few
of
these
back
if
it
werent
for
the
fact
that
something
just
seems
off
about
this
beer
overall
its
not
bad
its
just
not
well
balanced
pours
slightly
hazy
amberbrown
color
with
offwhite
head
nose
is
light
but
has
some
banana
and
brown
bread
notes
on
the
palate
it
comes
across
as
very
light
bodied
almost
watery
but
nonetheless
has
a
resemblance
of
the
traditional
dunkelweizen
flavors
also
more
wheaty
sweetness
is
noted
finishes
thin
and
a
bit
watered
down
without
a
lot
of
flavors
thanks
to
herb
for
the
bottle
d
nice
aroma
nice
taste
goes
down
smooth
not
really
a
session
beer
but
a
6pk
in
one
sitting
is
an
easily
achievable
goal
drinkability
easy
cheap
drinking
beer
only
purchased
it
because
the
place
i
went
to
was
way
over
priced
on
craft
beer
so
i
settled
for
this
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
one
of
abs
finest
offerings
d
a
touch
heavy
on
the
co2
but
good
overall
refreshing
enough
for
a
summer
day
but
also
malty
and
robust
enough
for
a
fall
evening
surprisingly
this
is
a
very
good
representation
of
the
dunkelweizen
style
from
ab
it
is
a
nice
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
good
head
and
carbonation
wonderful
light
malty
flavor
with
chocolate
and
coffee
notes
banana
and
clove
as
well
great
mouthfeel
clean
finish
its
ok
but
not
one
of
my
favorite
dunkel
weizens
sweet
caramel
taste
balanced
by
a
surprisingly
tart
finish
a
hint
of
the
hallertau
and
tettnang
hops
described
on
the
label
and
a
touch
of
clove
almost
too
sweet
but
quite
smooth
and
rather
drinkable
i
think
ill
have
another
definitely
drinkable
would
want
a
sixpack
as
it
would
be
too
sweet
but
good
for
one
or
two
bottles
md
very
smooth
not
much
carbonation
which
was
surprising
because
of
this
being
a
macrobeer
very
drinkable
and
something
i
would
enjoy
again
if
found
d
okay
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
the
first
dunkelweizen
that
ive
had
and
i
think
an
average
one
at
that
overall
a
pretty
good
shot
at
the
style
for
any
american
brewer
but
still
not
nearly
the
caliber
of
the
originals
bit
flat
overall
but
worth
a
shot
d
this
one
has
been
my
favorite
of
the
bunch
so
far
pleasantly
surprising
for
6
99
a
six
pack
this
is
something
i
would
grab
again
sometime
ill
tip
my
hat
to
a
well
brewed
beer
regardless
of
who
brewed
it
this
isnt
worldchanging
but
its
a
dang
good
session
and
were
it
not
for
political
stuff
id
probably
buy
it
ahead
of
some
other
kind
of
mediumfancy
beer
lik
say
fat
tire
i
got
this
beer
in
a
variety
pack
and
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
this
is
probably
the
most
enjoyable
beer
in
the
variety
pack
ginger
wheat
hop
hound
dukelweisse
shock
top
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
rubyamber
color
with
a
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dies
down
to
nothing
leaving
a
stagnent
looking
beer
save
the
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
not
overwhelming
but
is
a
nice
mixture
of
a
nice
malty
base
topped
with
fruity
and
spicy
phenols
i
get
more
banana
than
clove
the
taste
is
pretty
similar
with
the
malt
being
able
to
ascert
its
sweet
presence
more
than
in
the
nose
banana
is
still
present
but
the
clove
flavor
seems
to
be
more
dominant
there
also
seems
to
be
a
very
slight
astringency
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
seems
a
bit
on
the
light
side
for
a
dunkel
and
the
carbonation
could
stand
to
be
more
viscous
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
overly
good
either
this
could
be
a
good
intro
beer
into
the
craft
world
for
bmc
drinkers
quite
drinkable
nothing
bad
at
all
i
mean
this
has
a
real
flavor
kudos
to
a
conglomerate
that
achieves
that
but
i
will
stick
with
the
ole
pale
as
the
only
ab
brew
ill
touch
that
is
buy
pours
a
brown
color
nice
carbonation
small
white

with
some
sticky

is
malty
with
some

the

slightly
sweet

slight

note
slightly

medium

not

would
not
buy
again
very
enjoyable
beer
came
in
variety
12pack
of
wheat
beers
had
never
had
one
until
i
bought
that
very
tasty
and
the
smell
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
even
more
including
a
nice
hint
of
chocolate
only
thing
i
didnt
really
like
would
probably
be
the
aftertaste
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
otherwise
excellent
dark
wheat
ale
taste
is
pretty
good
as
well
a
bit
thin
and
lacking
a
bit
in
the
creaminess
department
but
this
is
a
fine
stab
at
the
dunkelweiss
style
chocolate
and
wheat
tang
are
accentuated
nicely
by
medium
amounts
of
banana
and
clove
probably
leans
a
bit
more
cloveish
most
likely
the
best
inbev
beer
made
most
certainly
worth
a
shot
for
any
wheat
beer
fan
out
there
if
it
were
not
for
the
poor
appearance
this
would
achieve
a
much
higher
score
d
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
offering
rather
tasty
went
down
very
easy
decent
representation
of
the
style
body
is
a
little
foamy
and
overcarbonated
but
still
carries
the
flavors
well
this
is
hardly
an
authentic
germanstyle
dunkel
but
its
nevertheless
a
passable
effort
by
the
american
macro
giant
overall
michelob
dunkelweisse
surprised
me
i
was
expecting
a
decent
beer
that
would
have
more
of
the
mass
produced
qualities
associated
with
the
brewer
instead
i
got
a
good
tasting
beer
that
nicely
represents
the
style
is
it
the
best
dunkelweizen
youll
try
no
but
it
is
worth
a
try
especially
for
someone
who
hasnt
had
this
style
d
i
was
impressed
that
this
was
a
beer
made
by
a
large
brewer
not
bad
at
all
easy
drinking
poured
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
glass
nice
cloudy
dark
amber
color
with
redorange
highlights
and
an
off
white
head
laced
good
and
had
a
great
aroma
i
loved
the
dark
wheat
taste
of
this
beer
nice
and
smooth
went
down
easy
was
suprised
it
worked
so
well
on
a
hot
day
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
craft
beer
from
michelob
its
not
a
bad
beer
overall
probably
one
of
abs
better
offerings
but
still
lacking
behind
what
is
available
these
days
not
a
very
good
looking
beer
grayish
brown
chocolate
milk
color
big
chunky
sediment
not
apealing
big
head
that
goes
away
quickly
yeasty
overripe
bannanas
with
some
kind
of
baking
spice
not
for
me
i
dont
know
much
about
this
kind
of
beer
but
i
think
it
might
be
a
case
of
not
liking
the
style
im
not
a
fan
of
the
heffewiezens
with
the
bannana
and
clove
this
has
that
but
with
stronger
flavor
so
it
should
stand
to
reason
that
i
dont
like
it
it
needed
some
malty
sweetness
or
hoppy
bitterness
to
balance
the
flavors
its
just
kind
of
bland
with
that
spicey
mushy
bannana
aftertaste
i
couldt
finish
the
bottle
if
you
like
dunkelweizens
this
is
probably
a
good
one
evidently
i
dont
reddish
amber
color
smells
of
banana
clove
and
bready
sweetness
along
with
dried
fruits
lots
of
banana
flavor
there
is
also
quite
a
bit
of
bready
malts
i
didnt
really
notice
any
caramel
it
is
nice
though
to
have
a
beer
from
ab
that
exhibits
different
taste
characteristics
for
different
taste
buds
this
isnt
just
a
good
beer
for
ab
its
a
plain
good
beer
regardless
of
manufacturer
carbonation
gave
a
pleasant
feel
id
not
have
a
problem
drinking
these
in
multiples
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
while
this
beer
doesnt
rank
up
there
with
the
best
in
the
style
its
not
too
bad
overall
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
small
head
smells
yummy
fruits
malts
spices
taste
is
delicious
a
great
combination
of
fruit
and
spices
this
beer
feels
great
in
the
mouth
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
high
quality
brew
drinkability
pretty
damn
good
beer
especially
by
the
standards
anheuserbusch
can
be
held
to
definitely
a
beer
thats
worth
a
try
and
definitely
something
i
would
have
no
problem
drinking
again
drinkability
an
average
dunkelweizen
better
than
i
expected
from
michelob
but
not
as
good
as
some
others
ive
had
pours
a
dark
redamber
color
with
generous
head
and
if
you
do
a
traditional
pour
cloudiness
aroma
is
banana
cream
and
caramel
malt
flavor
is
a
traditional
hefeweizen
with
a
generous
caramel
and
slight
roast
maltiness
very
nice
with
a
nice
touch
of
german
hops
finishes
fruity
and
malty
nice
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
a
very
good
beer
d
drinkability
high
overall
this
is
not
bad
at
all
cloudy
reddish
brown
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
lasts
for
a
bit
and
leaves
scraps
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
toasted
grain
with
the
requisite
bananaclove
aroma
typical
of
the
style
i
must
admit
this
is
an
above
average
example
of
the
style
toasted
pumpernickel
and
wheat
malt
with
soft
banana
and
savory
spice
notes
the
body
seems
a
little
light
with
ample
carbonation
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
hey
good
beer
is
good
beer
even
if
it
is
brewed
by
the
dark
side
pours
a
very
hazy
reddish
brown
with
a
soft
tan
head
has
all
of
the
usual
good
dunkelweizen
aromas
a
yeasty
breadiness
bananas
and
cloves
smells
are
not
as
potent
as
some
in
this
style
but
are
pleasant
taste
is
right
on
the
money
has
a
nice
toastiness
and
pleasant
sweetness
with
light
spices
its
body
could
bit
heftier
but
overall
this
a
good
beer
its
also
an
excellent
value
thanks
to
brothercannon
for
tossing
this
my
way
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
my
shaker
glass
appears
a
cloudy
dark
brown
color
with
about
a
finger
of
light
tan
head
nose
and
flavors
consist
of
toasted
wheat
caramel
yeast
a
tad
nutty
mild
chocolate
and
banana
notes
somewhat
thin
bodied
for
the
style
with
ample
carbonation
not
too
shabby
got
this
one
in
the
sampler
it
pours
medium
brown
caramel
with
little
to
no
head
or
lacing
as
far
as
smell
it
has
earthy
tones
like
patchouli
and
coffee
it
tastes
similar
to
how
it
smells
but
also
has
an
obvious
sweetness
not
picked
up
by
the
nose
its
an
all
around
average
beer
i
could
definitely
have
a
few
in
a
row
d
suprisingly
good
star
of
the
summer
sampler
pack
would
be
a
good
case
for
a
gathering
d
easy
to
drink
and
really
flavorful
describe
this
beer
the
best
this
isnt
my
absolute
favorite
style
so
i
probably
would
have
1
or
2
before
moving
on
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
and
i
like
the
fact
that
it
does
have
a
reasonably
authentic
profile
i
do
recommend
this
one
its
fine
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
again
from
bottle
into
tulip
pours
hazy
amber
with
moderate
white
head
aroma
of
caramel
malt
wheat
bread
yeast
and
slightly
hoppy
lacing
throughout
a
wellbalanced
beer
with
slightly
dry
and
bitter
finish
this
is
the
3rd
time
ive
encountered
this
brew
and
have
decided
it
is
the
best
offering
from
ab
today
a
beer
i
would
definitely
purchase
again
cheers
d
not
the
best
dunkel
that
ive
had
but
coming
from
ab
its
still
drinkable
hell
it
could
be
a
gateway
to
darker
beers
for
the
ab
crowd
finally
a
worthy
offering
from
ab
worth
another
go
around
to
rerate
if
i
can
find
another
bottle
thats
fresher
d
this
is
a
pretty
easy
drinking
dunkelweizen
not
my
favorite
but
perfectly
worth
having
more
of
d
a
pretty
solid
brew
overall
this
one
is
definitely
the
jewel
of
the
michelob
wheat
beer
sampler
i
picked
up
perhaps
a
dubious
honor
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
by
any
measurement
d
i
would
reach
for
something
else
but
i
guess
its
ok
would
be
better
with
less
metallic
character
maybe
damning
it
with
faint
praise
but
this
wasnt
a
bad
beer
certainly
the
best
of
the
wheat
sampler
i
purchased
redbrown
color
with
a
small
white
head
it
had
a
banana
and
sweet
malt
aroma
malt
banana
and
a
little
caramel
in
the
taste
medium
bodied
and
easily
drinkable
o
surprising
offering
form
ab
not
bad
at
all
overall
the
beer
is
very
agreeable
to
drink
but
if
youre
looking
for
more
wheat
in
your
wheatbeer
check
out
something
else
12
ounce
bottle
pours
dark
amber
with
a
quickly
departing
light
tan
head
no
lace
left
on
the
glass
the
nose
i
pick
up
is
some
light
cola
malt
infused
with
some
yeasty
notes
im
not
picking
up
much
of
a
wheat
character
some
more
cola
and
malt
and
thats
about
it
nothing
too
special
going
on
here
good
and
drinkable
drinkability
is
good
easy
drinking
priced
right
d
this
is
a
nice
effort
from
ab
there
are
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
but
i
did
enjoy
this
one
the
mineral
flavors
were
the
only
drawback
to
me
mouthfeel
is
high
carbonation
with
a
lingering
slight
bitterness
my
first
stab
at
this
style
with
an
ab
product
none
the
less
didnt
think
id
ever
say
that
after
reviewing
about
450
beers
i
gotta
say
its
pretty
darn
good
nice
mahogany
color
to
it
with
a
smallish
head
some
small
lacing
can
be
seen
nice
malty
taste
to
this
one
very
nutty
finish
to
it
and
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
to
all
the
hop
bombs
out
there
yeah
it
isnt
the
most
exciting
beer
but
its
a
rare
style
and
this
one
is
very
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
malty
taste
to
it
would
definitely
have
it
again
a
lot
of
other
michelob
stuff
aint
half
bad
either
beerbusiness
politics
aside
any
ba
who
wont
admit
that
this
is
a
really
good
american
take
on
this
style
of
beer
is
simply
a
poseur
anheuserbush
basher
or
a
person
whos
not
objective
enough
to
rate
within
the
style
the
aroma
is
great
i
am
surprised
very
nice
estery
banana
aroma
the
aroma
is
reminiscent
of
banana
bread
with
not
much
in
the
way
of
the
clove
phenol
that
i
personally
dont
like
about
weisse
beers
you
can
break
the
banana
bread
aroma
down
into
some
banana
vanilla
and
some
mostly
bready
and
sweet
malt
character
very
nice
job
there
for
a
macro
brewed
beer
it
pours
a
nice
brownish
red
and
had
a
decent
head
on
it
it
is
cloudy
as
a
weisse
beer
should
be
this
is
from
the
yeast
and
there
is
quite
bit
of
yeast
in
this
bottle
yet
even
though
i
swirled
it
up
mid
pour
in
the
flavor
i
do
get
some
clove
but
its
low
and
the
banana
flavor
is
also
what
i
think
of
when
i
smell
an
over
ripe
banana
sort
of
what
reminds
me
of
what
i
think
the
peel
would
taste
like
there
is
some
mild
vanilla
flavor
which
just
adds
to
the
beers
overall
appeal
the
malty
goodness
of
the
dunkel
weisse
style
is
not
lacking
here
there
is
some
crisp
chocolate
toast
and
sweet
caramel
as
well
as
that
typical
wheaty
grainy
flavor
there
are
some
flavors
from
the
yeast
that
i
like
as
well
although
the
flavors
are
very
noticeable
they
are
not
overpowering
and
the
overall
balance
between
the
malts
esters
phenols
is
done
very
well
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
chewy
and
quite
nice
for
this
style
but
maybe
just
a
bit
too
much
for
the
dunkel
weisse
style
the
mouthfeel
should
be
mediumlight
and
i
think
this
one
is
just
a
bit
over
that
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
it
showcases
the
banana
esters
and
even
the
clove
phenols
even
though
those
are
on
the
lower
side
real
nice
as
well
as
play
well
with
the
malts
used
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
much
but
that
is
minor
issue
the
fact
that
there
is
yeast
in
the
bottle
was
a
big
plus
that
i
was
not
expecting
with
michelob
the
flavors
and
aromas
were
not
only
true
to
style
but
also
done
fairly
well
i
may
be
scoring
this
a
bit
high
simply
because
i
had
much
lower
expectations
that
were
just
shattered
drinks
pretty
easy
one
of
abs
better
offering
a
good
stab
at
the
style
this
is
a
bad
beer
i
cant
believe
people
ever
drink
it
well
for
all
its
average
tastes
is
probably
somebodys
favorite
beer
just
not
mine
d
this
is
a
drinkable
brew
and
is
a
fairly
solid
example
of
the
style
d
a
admittedly
suprising
nice
dark
weiss
offering
by
michelob
this
is
a
caseworthy
beer
that
would
be
an
agreeable
crowd
pleaser
notes
pretty
good
mouthfeel
this
could
make
for
a
decent
go
to
macro
d
overall
not
too
bad
definetely
worth
drinking
a
decent
flavor
but
not
really
my
style
of
expertise
drinkability
is
pretty
good
for
this
beer
not
the
best
of
the
style
ive
tried
but
nothing
objectionable
worth
trying
d
a
pretty
decenr
beer
thatiwouldnt
mind
drinking
a
six
pack
of
nice
session
beer
12oz
bottle
obtained
as
part
of
a
sixpack
at
shaws
in
windham
nh
pours
a
murky
brown
body
with
a
half
inch
of
of
light
tan
head
toffee
and
chocolate
are
present
at
first
in
the
aroma
with
some
nut
hints
of
smoke
tastes
malty
with
some
dark
chocolate
graham
cracker
hints
of
smoke
and
nut
on
the
lighter
side
of
mediumbodied
with
ample
carbonation
fairly
easy
drinking
though
its
a
bit
more
dry
and
astringent
than
some
from
this
style
ive
had
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
definitely
not
a
dunkelweizen
on
training
wheels
for
sure
but
not
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
though
you
cannot
beat
the
price
i
got
a
sixpack
for
5
99
edit
after
having
a
few
more
of
these
and
one
right
after
another
breweries
dunkle
this
brew
does
fall
a
bit
short
in
mouthfeel
and
taste
watery
and
lacks
the
creaminess
that
is
typical
of
this
style
overall
ill
take
this
over
many
other
bmc
offerings
but
im
certainly
not
in
love
kudos
anheuserbusch
for
making
a
decent
dunkelweiss
d
probably
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
from
ab
a
solid
example
of
this
style
under
a
buck
a
bottle
is
quite
a
deal
i
vigorously
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
two
inches
of
head
mostly
from
my
carelessness
it
is
a
dark
copper
color
it
smells
like
ripe
bananas
it
has
a
nice
smooth
ripe
banana
taste
not
as
strong
as
i
remember
i
have
not
had
a
whole
lot
of
beers
in
this
style
but
i
think
it
is
quite
tasty
i
could
probably
drink
a
sixer
of
these
without
pause
all
in
all
a
nice
average
beer
id
grab
if
someone
offered
me
a
bmc
im
shocked
to
find
this
is
quite
a
popular
beer
in
the
comments
i
see
im
in
the
minority
i
purchased
this
in
a
variety
pack
with
shock
top
honey
wheat
and
hop
hound
i
found
this
beer
undrinkable
in
every
way
ive
had
two
already
served
off
two
and
the
other
two
may
rest
in
my
fridge
until
i
can
pawn
them
off
on
some
unsuspecting
guest
the
banana
aftertaste
is
awful
ive
had
sam
adams
blackberry
witbier
sam
adams
cherry
wheat
lancaster
brewing
compnay
strawberry
wheat
and
god
help
me
bud
lime
but
this
is
one
fruit
i
didnt
need
in
my
beer
to
those
that
enjoyed
it
cheers
i
have
two
waiting
for
you
4
this
one
seems
better
some
days
than
othersseems
to
benefit
from
sipping
leisurely
and
letting
the
beer
come
to
you
what
a
surprise
i
know
that
the
michelob
craft
beers
arent
bad
but
i
really
havent
been
impressed
until
now
this
cloudy
redbrown
doesnt
have
much
of
a
head
and
just
a
mild
aroma
of
yeast
and
cloves
but
its
not
really
about
that
though
i
have
had
better
dunkelweizens
this
is
near
the
top
of
the
style
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
flavors
wont
knock
you
over
but
the
bananaclovebread
is
noticeable
with
just
a
little
bit
of
spiciness
behind
it
all
definitely
a
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
again
poured
to
about
a
1
inch
head
that
didnt
hang
around
very
long
head
was
caramel
in
color
brew
was
reddish
brown
in
color
had
some
big
bubbles
floating
to
the
top
no
lacing
at
all
smelled
sweet
almost
to
sweet
smelled
a
little
like
chocolate
also
tasted
to
sweet
for
me
had
that
banana
flavor
going
on
that
i
dont
care
for
felt
over
carbonated
in
the
mouth
and
watery
wont
buy
these
again
got
a
mixed
variety
pack
kind
of
disappointed
in
this
one
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slightly
creamy
decent
carbonation
this
all
adds
up
to
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
not
a
bad
offering
at
all
and
for
the
price
very
nice
pured
a
murky
deep
copper
brown
with
less
yeast
than
the
style
has
lighter
carbonation
taste
is
bannana
and
a
touch
of
clove
not
much
else
its
not
complex
but
a
great
direction
michelob
has
gone
in
good
go
to
beers
i
was
happy
to
try
out
this
newer
offering
from
michelob
pushing
into
the
craft
beer
market
while
maybe
a
smart
marketing
approach
at
least
there
is
an
attempt
to
produce
a
decent
beer
or
two
do
their
heritage
right
the
bottle
design
label
is
a
nice
touch
that
seems
to
indicate
some
care
for
the
product
the
beer
came
in
a
mixpack
that
some
friends
had
grabbed
quickly
referred
to
the
dunkel
as
the
bacon
chips
beer
and
wondered
if
i
wanted
one
well
such
a
description
i
thought
was
not
too
savory
but
then
again
their
tastes
are
a
bit
more
restricted
shall
we
say
the
pour
was
a
decent
light
brown
with
goldenorange
edging
that
left
a
finger
plus
tannish
head
a
bit
of
lace
it
was
a
bit
of
a
pleasant
surprise
to
see
some
yeast
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
to
see
it
haze
up
the
appearance
as
well
the
aroma
was
not
as
smoky
as
it
was
made
out
to
be
rather
it
had
a
nice
roasted
cracker
malt
aroma
with
some
lemonyeast
the
flavor
was
likewise
but
with
a
nice
banana
pepper
sweet
malt
qualities
as
well
the
body
was
lighter
than
many
dunkels
but
still
had
some
creaminess
to
its
crispness
which
was
unexpected
by
no
means
a
great
dunkel
but
a
nice
worthwhile
beer
cheers
michelob
conclusion
nice
stab
at
the
style
by
ab
cheers
drinkability
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
style
which
is
superrising
of
me
to
say
out
of
a
michelob
beer
but
its
refreshing
and
enjoyable
not
a
great
beer
dont
get
me
wrong
but
solid
solid
beer
worth
a
shot
you
may
be
surprised
dont
judege
the
book
by
the
cover
slightly
hazy
mediumamber
with
a
small
offwhite
foamy
head
that
diminishes
to
a
tenacious
film
smell
is
very
wheatdominant
pineapple
caramel
a
little
clove
and
a
lot
of
banana
toasted
malt
and
a
wheat
sweetness
on
the
taste
banana
still
there
clove
more
noticeable
light
spice
on
the
crisp
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
dry
and
slightly
chalky
texture
and
moderate
carbonation
its
an
ok
beer
nothing
seems
too
out
of
place
but
its
nothing
special
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
dunkel
weizen
it
is
a
touch
tame
on
the
fermentationderived
flavors
for
my
particular
tastes
but
it
is
well
within
style
and
does
have
all
the
characteristic
notes
that
are
required
i
really
like
the
maltiness
that
is
in
this
brew
it
is
complex
and
interesting
and
i
think
that
this
is
way
underappreciated
by
the
craft
beer
world
i
would
call
the
appearance
average
for
the
style
deep
brown
body
with
about
a
half
inch
or
so
of
cream
colored
head
swirled
the
last
bit
and
poured
again
this
beer
has
more
sediment
than
i
was
expecting
which
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
about
smells
very
nice
with
banana
and
a
bit
of
clove
and
light
brown
sugar
good
flavor
to
the
beer
with
the
light
banana
and
clove
flavors
that
develop
into
a
richer
light
brown
sugar
flavor
however
overall
the
beer
gives
a
very
light
drinkable
impression
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
and
does
a
good
job
of
the
style
its
hard
to
beat
for
the
price
6
99
for
a
6
pack
in
pa
overall
it
is
an
above
average
beer
and
there
arent
many
beers
of
this
quality
i
can
pick
a
six
pack
up
for
this
price
in
pa
notes
this
is
defiantly
one
of
the
best
ab
products
very
enjoyable
beer
the
color
is
a
bit
unappetizing
but
the
light
refreshing
taste
makes
that
easy
to
ignore
d
shocking
drinkability
for
this
one
the
mixed
pack
is
definately
a
mixed
bag
but
this
one
is
a
keeper
great
unique
flavor
d
nice
job
done
by
michelob
and
this
would
be
my
favorite
beer
out
of
their
mixed
case
very
drinkable
yet
flavorful
thumbs
up
this
beer
is
part
of
the
michelob
wheat
sampler
pack
its
dark
and
has
a
fairly
large
but
quick
falling
head
it
smells
malty
like
a
dunkelweizen
should
the
flavor
is
surprisingly
good
malt
and
wheat
take
center
stage
here
i
could
drink
several
of
these
not
world
class
but
not
too
bad
either
its
actually
leaving
a
little
lacing
on
my
glass
whod
a
thunk
it
michelob
dunkel
weisse
pours
a
dark
copper
color
with
a
tan
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
a
touch
of
chocolate
definite
clove
and
some
banana
all
appear
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
has
lots
of
ripe
banana
some
clove
a
bit
of
cocoa
wow
this
is
much
better
than
i
would
have
expected
aroma
is
rich
wheaty
and
yeasty
enough
to
make
you
forget
this
is
technically
a
macrobrew
it
pours
a
dark
hazy
brown
with
a
decent
if
not
persistent
offwhite
head
flavor
is
strongly
wheaty
yeasty
and
slightly
spicy
texture
is
smooth
and
tingly
leaving
a
pleasing
finish
overall
this
is
the
best
beer
made
by
one
of
the
big
5
that
ive
had
and
by
a
long
margin
given
its
price
it
could
end
up
as
a
staple
in
my
fridge
i
see
no
reason
not
to
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
wheat
beers
and
wants
something
good
to
drink
for
an
inexpensive
price
recommended
by
me
my
score
of
a
b
seems
low
but
honestly
its
a
very
solid
dunkel
dont
expect
a
germanquality
dunkel
but
almost
there
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
you
can
get
past
the
smell
maybe
after
a
couple
you
wont
notice
but
im
not
ready
to
find
out
d
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
over
and
over
again
it
is
really
good
and
i
would
definitely
pair
this
up
with
something
sweet
like
bourbon
chicken
or
some
other
kind
of
chinese
food
with
a
sweetsour
sauce
ill
likely
pick
up
another
6
pack
of
this
style
and
quite
possibly
more
when
the
warmer
months
roll
around
hard
to
find
a
decent
dunkelweisse
around
here
without
driving
60
miles
one
direction
so
this
will
be
a
nice
addition
to
my
rotation
james

in

it
started
with
a
large
offwhite

that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
banana

the
taste
was
toasted

with
more

with
a
dry

it
was
mediumlight
in

and
with
a
fairly
high

was
good
this
is
a
decent
dunkelweizen
and
worth
a
try
i
guess
it
is
not
terrible
i
just
really
am
not
a
fan
of
the

a

from

the

i
have
a
bit
a
mixed
feelings
about
these
new
craft
ab
beers
marketing
technique
or
true
effort
due
to
being
taken
over
by
the
belgians
however
if
the
other
beers
in
this
series
follow
sit
to
this
oneand
from
reading
the
other
reviews
i
see
they
dont
i
guess
ill
stick
to
this
one
its
the
only
sixer
of
good
dunkleweisse
i
know
of
d
dark
wheat
beers
are
hard
to
perfect
and
this
one
doesnt
come
close
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
particularly
want
another
this
was
a
big
surprise
i
would
use
this
beer
to
convert
bmc
drinkers
to
craft
as
well
as
surprise
any
beer
geek
with
this
impressive
offering
from
ab
i
have
tried
a
couple
of
michelobs
craft
line
now
and
so
far
find
all
of
them
extremely
drinkable
they
are
light
not
strong
with
the
alcohol
and
all
seem
to
finish
dry
and
make
the
next
sip
inviting
i
like
this
beer
and
for
the
price
and
accesabailty
its
been
in
my
fridge
every
time
i
come
across
it
pours
a
dark
murky
brown
with
a
small
head
that
disappears
quite
fast
there
is
also
a
thin
layer
of
yeast
in
the
trub
which
adds
slightly
to
the
flavor
to
give
it
a
more
rich
taste
the
wheat
scent
is
not
at
all
subtle
and
is
about
the
only
aroma
noticed
it
tastes
like
an
average
wheat
beer
with
a
bland
taste
of
yeast
and
roasted
malts
has
a
really
thick
feel
but
ends
smooth
not
bad
for
a
michelob
beer
but
not
one
of
the
better
affordable
dark
wheats
i
really
liked
the
color
on
this
one
and
it
poured
with
a
strong
head
its
cloud
because
it
is
i
unfiltered
i
could
smell
cloves
and
malt
right
away
the
first
sip
did
not
impress
me
but
as
i
got
through
the
pint
the
more
i
was
impressed
while
it
has
a
slight
grittiness
it
is
a
crisp
beer
with
interesting
but
not
complex
taste
m
d
medium
body
rather
crisp
but
not
too
much
so
a
little
stickiness
in
the
feel
a
nice
take
on
the
style
and
a
nod
to
michelob
maybe
a
little
tart
for
the
style
and
my
taste
but
not
too
bad
it
was
drinkable
but
i
probably
will
not
be
returning
to
this
beer
any
time
soon
this
beer
has
a
lot
going
for
it
its
pretty
drinkable
maybe
a
bit
too
sweet
to
drink
the
piss
outta
but
ill
definitely
drink
another
as
it
makes
a
fantastic
afterdinnerdessert
beer
as
others
have
said
i
agree
ab
made
a
good
craft
beer
try
it
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
byt
this
offering
by
michelob
i
had
never
tried
this
style
and
certainly
enjoyed
it
this
was
infinitely
better
than
the
amber
bock
i
had
earlier
worth
the
price
for
someone
new
to
the
style
overall
solid
bargain
paid
6
50six
but
could
have
gotten
a
case
for
11
after
a
mailin
rebate
at
that
price
it
is
basically
unbeatable
michelob
did
a
fine
job
of
making
a
real
beer
here
with
great
presentation
but
needs
to
tweak
the
formula
to
bring
up
that
mouth
feel
and
flavor
to
the
kind
that
makes
you
want
that
second
glass
now
drinkability
really
excellent
work
from
michelob
here
this
is
a
winner
a
very
good
complex
and
easytodrink
beer
i
recommend
this
beer
and
i
give
it
an
a
because
when
rating
it
to
how
it
stands
up
as
a
domestic
beer
brewed
to
an
old
world
country
beer
style
it
does
very
well
i
like
experimenting
and
trying
different
kinds
of
beer
but
this
is
a
new
flavor
for
me
perhaps
i
wasnt
prepared
for
it
because
nowhere
on
the
packaging
does
it
say
warning
this
beer
tastes
like
bananas
maybe
im
still
new
to
beer
critiquing
but
i
for
one
will
not
be
purchasing
any
more
michelob
dunkelweisse
i
like
michelob
beers
but
not
this
one
notes
i
think
its
worth
noting
the
packaging
of
this
beer
just
because
i
was
so
impressed
by
it
the
sixpack
box
lists
the
types
of
malts
used
in
the
beer
the
types
of
hops
the
ibus
and
various
other
features
of
the
beer
this
is
in
my
opinion
a
great
way
to
get
your
average
beer
drinker
into
the
craft
beer
market
educating
the
public
on
what
makes
a
beer
taste
like
it
does
is
very
reminiscent
to
samuel
adams
commercials
and
also
a
great
way
to
lure
the
craft
beer
drinker
into
drinking
michelob
all
in
all
i
think
anheuserbusch
is
making
some
great
steps
forward
and
this
beer
is
no
exception
d
for
a
macro
brewery
this
is
pretty
good
beer
and
a
really
good
representation
of
the
style
it
is
a
bit
watery
but
that
helps
the
drinkability
because
it
doesnt
sit
heavy
at
all
the
flavors
are
damn
good
and
it
actually
has
a
pretty
decent
aroma
if
michelob
keeps
it
up
who
knows
whats
going
to
happen
i
wouldnt
want
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
night
and
there
is
no
reason
to
buy
this
over
the
real
thing
franziskaner
weihenstephaner
or
ayinger
dunkels
this
michelob
is
better
than
the
porter
in
my
estimation
a
good
brew
to
try
if
you
are
into
the
weizens
if
all
of
abs
craft
brews
could
hit
this
var
they
might
have
something
drinkability
overall
very
drinkable
but
i
dont
think
this
is
a
beer
i
would
buy
much
of
under
normal
circumstances
if
money
were
no
object
there
are
other
things
i
would
go
to
first
no
question
however
for
the
price
it
is
a
good
buy
if
the
michelob
line
continues
to
move
in
this
direction
i
can
see
myself
going
to
them
as
a
good
fallback
set
of
beers
for
when
my
wallet
needs
a
break
not
bad
as
far
as
what
i
expected
but
its
like
a
watereddown
sweetened
up
version
of
a
dunkle
overall
eh
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
brother
thelonious
goblet
this
beer
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
decent
2
inch
head
that
leaves
no
lacing
and
just
a
little
rim
of
head
around
the
outskirts
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
dead
on
dunkelweisse
everything
that
i
thought
should
be
there
was
banana
toasted
bread
clove
and
a
bit
of
nuttiness
to
boot
basically
banana
nut
bread
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
but
unfortunately
the
banana
comes
off
more
as
a
laffy
taffy
banana
then
a
fresh
banana
it
makes
it
just
a
tad
to
sweet
if
they
could
control
that
this
could
really
be
a
top
notch
dunkelweisse
the
mouthfeel
is
full
and
tasty
leaving
a
lingering
flavor
on
the
palate
i
really
enjoy
the
way
the
michelob
line
is
coming
around
and
i
think
this
is
the
best
beer
they
do
the
college
boy
i
saw
buying
this
wasnt
an
idiot
after
all
i
was
happy
to
find
a
nice
dunkelweisse
that
was
not
too
expensive
it
was
a
bit
of
a
surprise
that
a
beer
from
michelob
was
as
good
as
it
was
but
i
was
quite
impressed
at
less
than
7
for
a
sixpack
you
could
certainly
do
a
lot
worse
given
that
bud
is
creeping
close
to
that
price
nowadays
but
id
just
as
soon
spend
a
little
extra
to
get
a
genuine
bavarian
dunkelweizen
try
a
little
harder
next
time
michelob
pours
a
murky
orangebrown
with
fast
fading
head
smell
faint
a
bit
of
yeast
and
overripe
banana
a
touch
of
caramel
and
chocolate
cake
taste
caramel
toasted
cloves
tangy
wheat
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
active
carbonation
but
not
particularly
creamy
or
soft
this
isnt
the
best
example
of
the
style
but
it
is
tasty
and
gets
bonus
points
for
the
price
pours
a
slightly
murky
reddish
brown
with
nice
fluffy
head
and
some
lacing
malty
aroma
with
wheat
molasses
and
a
clove
notes
present
taste
is
a
nice
blend
of
malt
with
a
slight
hint
of
cloves
not
a
bad
stab
at
the
style
certainly
one
of
the
better
ab
offerings

this

texture
finishes
dry
and
astringent
the
dunkelweisse
looks
the
part
and
smells
the
part
but
falls
a
little
short
in
taste
could
use
some
bigger
clove
and
banana
flavor
still
not
bad
for
one
of
the
big
boys
this
beer
pours
a
dark

you
how

drinking
dunkel
weisse
i
was
able
to
find
it
in
pa
no
local
grocers
were
carrying
it
in
ohio
or
wv
mouthfeel
is
soft
with
spritzy
carbonation
sweet
and
dry
mixes
well
while
the
body
is
medium
overall
finishes
clean
on
the
palate
doesnt
linger
in
anyway
drinkability
is
excellent
really
a
nice
showing
of
abs
talent
at
tackling
traditional
styles
and
pulling
it
off
quite
well
mediumlight
in
body
with
zesty
carbonation
this
is
a
delicious
and
quaffable
surprise
easily
the
best
ab
product
i
ever
remember
drinking
and
a
fitting
kickoff
to
a
fond
farewell
thanks
for
the
bottle
chuck
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
this
was
the
first
michelob
product
that
i
actually
planned
on
buying
when
i
went
to
the
store
it
is
an
excellent
beer
and
i
really
think
it
is
underrated
good
flavorful
refreshing
dunkelweisse
i
was
a
little
surprised
with
the
quality
given
the
brewer
good
quaff
especially
if
you
like
this
style
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
yeasty
with
a
slightly
thinner
weight
than
traditional
of
the
style
good
carbonation
amazing
bang
for
buck
the
price
is
certainly
right
for
such
a
tasty
brew
d
could
be
better
if
it
were
put
up
directly
with
the
best
of
bavaria
but
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
the
style
i
have
come
across
allinall
a
very
satisfying
interpretation
of
the
style
drinkability
up
there
with
the
michelob
porter
as
the
best
of
what
the
brand
has
to
offer
this
ones
far
better
than
their
other
stab
at
a
german
style
the
truly
awful
amber
bock
in
my
opinion
tone
down
the
carbonation
ever
so
slightly
and
make
the
malt
profile
a
little
more
robust
and
complex
and
this
would
be
one
heck
of
a
session
beer
given
its
5
5
abv
d
very
drinkable
the
more
i
had
the
more
i
liked
it
definately
will
try
more
i
like
what
anheuserbusch
is
doing
with
the
michelob
line
michelob
porter
michelob
bavarian
style
wheat
and
now
michelob
dunkelweisse
are
beers
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
ive
given
up
hope
that
theyll
ever
release
anything
outstanding
but
credit
must
be
given
where
credit
is
due
this
would
be
a
good
import
coming
from
germany
but
instead
comes
from
an
american
macrobrewery
and
who
can
dismiss
the
price
when
people
are
complaining
about
high
beer
prices
this
is
a
good
tasting
beer
you
can
save
some
dough
on
0
79
for
a
single
12
ounce
bottle
at
total
wine
equals
a
4

sixpack
awesome
bang
for
the
buck
sampled
in
december
2008
and
poured
from
a
12
fl
oz
bottle
marked
08265vc09
the
look
is
quite
nice
with
a
cloudy
but
dark
brown
tone
and
a
small
beige
head
that
fizzes
in
short
order
the
aroma
is
mainly
of
yeast
malts
and
perhaps
bananas
it
was
not
the
greatest
aromatic
experience
i
had
ever
had
the
texture
had
a
little
body
but
it
tended
to
be
more
watered
down
the
taste
was
very
yeasty
to
me
but
the
taste
was
milder
than
the
pungent
unusual
aroma
for
a
little
over
six
bucks
i
took
a
flyer
on
this
beer
and
ill
tell
ya
what
i
really
liked
it
poured
into
my
schneiderbrooklyner
hopfen
glass
a
clear
light
to
medium
brown
with
just
a
hint
of
burnt
orangea
clingyfluffy
slight
off
white
two
finger
head
atop
aromas
are
a
little
phenolic
with
notes
of
vanilla
and
toast
as
wella
lighter
mouthfeel
but
its
not
watery
by
any
means
pleasant
on
the
palatelighter
flavors
but
well
roundedsome
vanilla
and
clove
along
with
banana
and
some
light
toasted
wheat
malt
ab
did
a
great
job
here
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
itmore
solid
offerings
like
this
to
me
will
only
help
their
cause
in
the
craft
beer
marketwell
done
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
even
with
the
slightly
off
flavors
someone
offers
you
one
dont
turn
it
down
maybe
even
grab
a
sixer
for
some
crossover
beer
drinkers
this
is
a
very
well
done
version
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
considering
the
price
point
you
get
a
lot
of
bang
for
your
buck
with
this
beer
its
right
to
style
which
is
a
bold
move
kudos
to
michelob
edit
as
this
beer
warms
it
gets
better
exponentially
very
good
example
of
a
weiss
beer
intense
sweetness
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
overall
not
a
bad
effort
d
a
decent
beer
from
the
big
boys
overall
much
closer
to
style
than
i
wouldve
guessed
for
the
price
there
are
better
things
out
there
but
i
wont
mind
drinking
the
rest
of
this
sixer
though
a
bit
more
malt
presence
would
be
welcome
and
expected
for
a
dunkelweizen
this
is
nevertheless
a
solid
weizenbier
and
a
splendid
offering
from
this
macro
brewer
rich
with
character
and
able
to
hold
its
own
in
such
a
category
and
virtually
unbeatable
in
such
a
category
for
the
price
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
tart
from
the
wheat
with
creamy
cocoa
sticking
to
the
palate
on
the
finish
overall
a
farily
average
dunkelweiss
still
probably
one
of
the
better
michelobs
i
have
had
a
surprisingly
good
beer
from
michelob
very
enjoyable
d
good
example
of
the
style
nothing
over
the
top
or
super
but
well
done
it
is
easy
to
drink
a
few
of
these
this
beer
pours
a
reddish
brown
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
billowy
and
recedes
slowly
into
nice
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
banana
bread
cloves
with
hints
of
cocoa
the
taste
has
the
same
nice
banana
bread
clove
and
cocoa
of
the
aroma
but
it
is
not
as
vibrant
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
and
too
light
for
a
dunkelweizen
for
my
liking
overall
this
is
the
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
anheuserbusch
and
i
could
easily
drink
this
again
it
is
really
nice
to
see
them
brewing
this
style
as
it
seems
to
scare
off
nearly
all
crafts
breweries
i
thought
this
beer
was
alright
but
as
i
look
at
my
notes
i
wrote
average
down
the
board
i
thought
that
the
smell
and
the
taste
were
a
little
too
candy
like
for
a
dunkel
weisse
and
there
was
barely
anything
for
the
flavors
you
usually
get
with
a
wheat
beer
it
had
a
dark
brown
body
with
moderate
head
and
lace
there
were
some
mild
clove
and
banana
tones
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
just
too
average
hey
but
average
is
drinkable
bottle
from
smiths
pours
a
brownreddish

with
a
large

the
aroma
is
pretty
strong
lots
of

and
a
light
citrus
and
banana
too
the
taste
was
quite
nice
some
spicy
flavors
cloves
mostly
some
banana
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
body
was
pretty
decent
and
fairly
full
a
surprisingly
good
beer
at
a
good
price
pours
a
dark
caramel
brown

huge
frothy
light

that
is
surprisingly
lasting

some

three
words

are

geek
but
interesting
enough
i
think
ab
has
found
a
winner
in
the
michelob
family
ill
definitely
revisit
this
offering
again
overall
impression
drinkable
beer
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
this
six
pack
will
go
fast
a
good
representation
of
the
style
but
overall
it
lacks
a
depth
that
finer
dunkels
exhibit
of
course
those
beers
are
34
more
a
six
pack
a
decent
value
this
is
another
nice
one
from
the
michelob
craft
family
ive
yet
to
see
them
release
an
a
level
beer
but
most
have
been
in
the
b
range
and
are
solid
all
around
this
one
is
no
exception
the
only
complaint
is
the
mouthfeel
perhaps
not
really
but
i
think
it
should
i
do
wish
it
was
a
little
fuller
of
a
mouthfeel

drpimentoaug

but
the
beer
still
comes
across
just
a
little
thinner
than
id
like
good
carbonation
and
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
slight
spiciness
lingering
in
the
mouth
all
in
all
i
have
to
say
it
looks
like
ab
is
actually
creating
some
solid
beers
in
their
michelob
lineup
mbrandon2w0
pours
a
really
dark
brown
with
almost
no
red
tone
to
it
and
looks
like
theres
some
cloud
to
it
due
to
this
but
held
to
the
light
its
clarified
not
much
head
to
speak
of
and
im
having
this
in
a
tallish
sort
of
goblet
that
i
like
for
lagers
saisons
and
belgian
ipas
not
the
prettiest
beer
ive
ever
beheld
but
the
aroma
is
nice
bready
and
malty
and
the
flavor
follows
suit
with
a
nice
tang
to
it
very
sweet
and
a
little
chocolaty
with
very
very
light
alcohol
super
drinkable
nice
and
clean
good
carbonation
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
but
dont
think
id
buy
another
sixer
probably
opt
for
some
leffe
brun
or
an
oktoberfest
with
a
little
more
abv
still
i
think
they
did
really
well
with
this
one
and
ill
surely
have
to
try
one
on
draught
next
time
im
at
prost
i
see
what
the
hype
is
about
now
this
prost
beer
is
good
stuff
served
at
the
bicycle
cafe
and
apparently
a
different
brew
than
the
dunkel
lager
already
on
ba
this
is
a
weiss
beer
meaning
wheat
malt
and
trust
me
when
i
say
its
malty
it
pours
a
very
thick
and
cloudy
almost
brown
red
color
with
a
very
dense
white
head
on
top
there
is
a
ton
of
suspended
sediment
just
how
i
like
there
its
got
a
hefe
nose
on
it
all
spicy
and
clovey
and
banana
smelling
from
the
yeast
only
difference
is
the
dark
wheat
base
it
has
underneath
it
is
a
bit
sweeter
than
the
lighter
version
its
got
a
gentle
sweetness
maybe
a
touch
of
molasses
or
something
going
on
here
feel
is
excellent
and
quite
unexpected
huge
body
for
the
style
and
mild
carbonation
its
incredibly
smooth
and
drinkable
especially
at
this
low
abv
this
could
be
consumed
all
day
long
pretty
easily
its
very
very
soft
in
the
mouth
and
glides
down
easy
my
first
prost
beer
has
inspired
a
brewery
visit
maybe
next
weekend
poured
from
the
bottle
into
furstenberg
glassware
that
i
got
from
the
brewery
34
years
ago
this
is
my
first
taste
of
this
beer
since
the
late
80s
as
it
has
not
been
available
in
the
us
since
then
i
got
this
beer
from
quebec
frothy
browny
head
very
thick
as
i
remember
it
being
the
body
of
the
beer
is
also
dark
but
a
bit
on
the
amber
brown
side
the
first
sip
brought
back
memories
of
my
time
in
the
black
forest
of
germany
where
the
brewery
is
located
malty
sweetness
slight
banana
flavor
wheat
bread
on
the
backside
a
deeelicious
brew
that
i
wish
i
could
get
more
ofter
one
of
my
favorite
beers
among
my
favorite
variety
fwhd
is
pretty
much
on
par
for
this
type
of
beer
its
medium
brown
in
colour
with
a
light
head
that
lasts
a
while
but
leaves
zero
lacing
rather
than
bananas
i
smell
cherry
in
this
one
in
addition
to
the
expected
wheat
aromas
its
wheat
character
is
quite
strong
in
the
taste
highlighted
by
the
fruity
tastes
a
little
sour
cherry
and
plum
its
fine
carbonation
and
dry
finish
make
it
feel
very
good
going
down
good
stuff
o
wouldnt
to
go
after
this
again
drink
i
enjoyed
my
first
few
sips
of
the
beer
but
started
to
notice
and
slightly
off
taste
as
i
progressed
through
the
glass
it
just
seems
to
be
lacking
the
balance
of
some
of
the
other
beers
in
this
category
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
looks
very
nice
and
tastes
good
but
not
something
id
want
much
more
of
cloudy
amber
brown
colour
aroma
is
weak
with
malt
spice
and
wheat
flavour
is
lots
of
malt
and
spice
with
wheat
and
hop
mouthfeel
is
very
nice
im
a
little
surprised
that
this
is
ranked
the
low
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
purchased
at
the
saq
boogy
d
perfect
drinking
refreshing
beer
appropriate
representation
of
the
style
easily
quaffable
in
large
quantities
a
true
dunkelweiss
form
a
rather
lager
brewery
in
germany
d
not
so
bad
but
a
bit
too
sour
for
drinkability
overall
insufficient
presence
to
be
interesting
not
offensive
but
not
inspirational
either
take
it
or
leave
it
available
in
the
saq
quebec
average
and
not
objectionable
beer
taste
is
spicy
again
without
the
stronger
yeast
products
of
clove
and
banana
wheat
is
apparent
and
the
caramel
adds
a
slight
astringent
taste
aftertaste

dry
and

drinkability
was
not
great
i
seem
to
miss
the
yeast
complexity
and
a
bit
bite
overall
i
am
a
big
fan
of
weizen
beers
and
this
one
is
simply
just
acceptable
it
is
not
horrible
but
it
is
far
from
great
either
thanks
all
the
same

thanks
for

thanks
a

jan
drinkability
is
not
good
this
one
was
not
very
enjoyable
and
tough
to
get
down
wont
go
looking
for
this
one
again
d
good
mealtime
beer
easy
going
but
with
enough
character
to
add
something
to
the
meal
bottle
poured
a
dark
brownish
color
dunkel
with
a
big
bubbly
head
with
better
then
average
retention
aroma
of
cloves
and
banana
is
very
weak
with
some
sweet
malt
also
noticeable
taste
of
banana
and
cloves
are
again
too
subtle
for
the
style
imo
with
a
very
light
body
i
guess
this
one
is
average
at
best
but
clearly
not
something
i
would
seek
again
i
must
admit
that
i
havent
had
many
hefe
dunkel
weizens
but
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
every
sip
makes
me
want
another
very
refreshing
cloudy
copper
hue
big
welllaced
offwhite
head
lasts
long
interesting
yeasty
nose
comes
out
peppery
bready
with
notes
of
lime
and
banana
light
taste
reminds
of
banana
muffin
andor
caramel
cookies
soft
body
with
immense
carbonation
pretty
decent
in
its
style
but
im
not
huge
on
wheat
beers
in
general
deep
amber
sporting
highlights
of
goldflecked
orange
under
a
puffy
khaki
top
clove
spice
dominates
fruity
nut
bread
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
cinnamon
back
a
bit
too
thin
and
spritzy
not
quite
as
deep
and
good
as
my
favorite
bavarian
dunkelweiss
but
tasty
in
its
own
south
german
way
try
it
with
pommes
und

while
listening
to
techno
pours
a
cloudy

color
with
a
white
head
and
some
lace
aroma
of

caramelized

and
a
hint
of

in
the
taste
a
big
dose
of
caramelized
flavor
moderate

and
hardly
any
bitterness
medium

feel
with
a
good

surely
not

delicious

abv
dunkel
with
a
firm
nutty
malty
flavor
and
a
hint
of
hop
and
clove
had
this
on
tap
at
the
brick
store
pub
awhile
ago
poured
a
dark
chestnut
with
a
head
that
faded
pretty
quickly
but
left
some
nice
lacing
there
were
lightt
smells
of
brown
bread
banana
and
a
touch
of
tin
the
taste
is
spicy
and
slightly
roasty
to
begin
followed
by
more
brown
bread
and
bananas
slightly
thin
but
very
crisp
and
even
crackery
extremely
dry
i
would
have
like
this
to
have
been
a
tad
more
luscious
it
was
good
but
it
didnt
wow
me
the
depth
of
flavor
was
a
little
light
and
it
was
a
trifle
thin
for
those
times
when
grain
is
what
you
crave
victory
brings
you
this
fine
offering
the
malt
is
sweet
the
wheat
is
crisp
and
the
result
is
a
pint
of
fetching
flavor
and
refreshing
notes
and
with
that
judicious
abv
drinking
it
is
a
fun
little
pasttime
in
fact
in
an
evening
of
more
than
a
few
new
flavors
this
one
was
1b
not
a
bad
standing
i
would
be
most
encouraged
if
this
one
made
its
way
into
bottles
because
having
the
option
of
enjoying
it
at
home
would
make
it
even
better
d
good
drink
my
wife
and
i
polished
off
the
growler
but
the
wheat
beers
are
not
imho
victorys
strongest
asset
good
but
nothing
to
get
hyped
about
a
nice
beer
but
a
bit
dissapointing
creamy
bannana
sweet
and
spicey
and
hoppy
on
tap
at
the
standard
tap
and
i
thought
this
would
be
something
available
later
in
the
summer
brown
colour
spot
of
toastiness
nuttiness
long
finish
something
different
from
victory
in
fact
i
find
their
beers
are
all
unique
prosit
draught
victory
this
beer
is
a
cloudy
coppery
color
there
was
no
head
to
it
at
all
the
aroma
has
notes
of
banana
cloves
and
some
other
fruits
the
taste
is
somewhat
malty
sweet
with
hints
of
the
banana
cloves
again
also
some
nuttiness
and
a
bit
yeasty
very
good
nice
brownish
color
with
a
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
their
weizenbock
similar
malt
base
instead
of
bananas
and
cloves
this
seemed
to
just
have
cloves
in
the
background
good
drinkability
to
go
along
with
the
taste
will
hit
the
spot
if
you
want
a
nice
malty
beer

o
im
a
big
fan
of
dunkelweiss
and
i
like
sam
adams
but
this
one
doesnt
quite
come
together
like
i
had
hope
it
would
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
one
of
sas
best
or
one
of
the
better
options
out
there
for
the
style
this
beer
pours
up
a
deep
fairly
clear
gold
with
a
big
three
finger
head
which
stays
around
for
awile
and
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
behind
the
smell
is
mainly
yeast
and
banana
the
taste
is
mainly
yeast
as
well
there
is
also
a
metallic
taste
not
much
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
nothing
special
just
average
id
say
this
beer
is
very
average
just
not
a
treat
to
drink
at
all
ill
pass
on
more
o
its
not
bad
if
you
enjoy
the
clove
and
banana
character
of
the
bavarian
yeast
not
really
my
thing
but
it
is
what
it
is
o
this
is
actually
a
really
terrific
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
if
it
had
a
little
more
haze
and
a
little
more
body
this
would
be
at
least
a
4
5
all
around
i
am
very
impressed
by
sam
adams
on
this
one
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
but
it
wasnt
memorable
o
the
yeast
is
front
and
center
dominating
everything
after
that
the
beer
turns
to
water
most
likely
from
the
wheat
dulling
any
malts
or
hops
meh
not
too
bad
of
a
dunkel
however
this
is
definatly
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
they
seemed
to
have
nailed
all
the
basics
the
wheat
really
outshines
all
the
other
elements
in
this
beer
very
mellow
and
easy
drinking
however
it
is
lacking
flavor
average
at
best
smells
like
cloves
and
apricot
and
a
couple
days
until
ripe
banana
tastes
like
cloves
with
a
sour
wheat
tang
in
back
mildly
sweet
and
nutty
bottle
claims
tropical
fruit
but
thats
a
bit
of
a
reach
mouthfeel
is
fair
but
lacks
any
standout
wheat
beer
creamy
smooth
wheat
beeryness
taste
is
eclectic
hints
of
honeyclove
fruit
cake
perhaps
not
overbearing
though
not
at
all
bitter
very
crisp
ill
have
another
overall
not
sure
how
i
feel
about
this
one
i
guess
it
isnt
bad
but
not
preference
at
all
i
will
drink
what
i
have
but
will
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
have
this
one
again
o
disappointed
i
like
dunkelweizens
but
this
one
is
just
totally
off
kilter
on
the
taste
not
horrible
but
misses
the
mark
a
bit
o
it
would
have
been
ok
if
bbc
hadnt
completely
missed
the
boat
on
taste
maybe
i
got
a
bad
bottle
but
this
is
approaching
drain
pour
territory
based
solely
on
taste
the
other
good
qualities
cannot
make
up
for
that
o
i
found
this
a
fun
beer
that
made
the
fall
sampler
pack
even
better
while
not
the
best
in
the
pack
hazel
brown
is
nice
id
be
happy
to
try
this
again
taste
is
of
wheat
a
slight
sweetness
with
nice
spiciness
roasted
malt
cherry
banana
with
other
fruits
which
i
cannot
identify
it
seems
pretty
similar
to
the
imported
varieties
to
me
drinkability
is
very
good
too
overall
this
one
is
pretty
good
and
it
is
much
better
than
i
expected
o
a
decent
brew
overall
id
drink
another
one
o
complex
and
well
blended
i
havent
had
too
many
dunkels
but
this
imo
is
pretty
tasty
i
picked
up
the
harvest
seasonal
12
pk
and
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
in
the
group
o
this
is
a
strong
beer
coming
from
americas
rather
poor
inventory
in
this
style
the
german
counterparts
are
indeed
better
but
this
is
not
a
failure
poured
from
a
bottle
into
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
clear
hazelnut
coloring
with
no
lick
of
head
whatsoever
aromas
of
clove
spicing
malty
sweetness
of
caramel
and
toffee
and
an
overall
roasting
flavors
are
sweet
with
a
toffee
and
caramel
backbone
that
is
kept
in
check
by
the
light
carbonated
body
roasty
warmly
spiced
characteristics
the
aftertaste
is
sugary
sweet
with
some
balance
from
spicing
but
the
sweetness
wins
out
sharp
effervescent
in
mouth
at
the
end
with
a
slight
sweet
linger
served
from
bottle
into
a
shaker
poured
brown
with
a
one
finger
offwhite
head
that
subsided
to
a
minimal
amount
very
quickly
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
bread
wheat
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bread
wheat
grain
and
earth
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
while
this
was
a
decent
example
of
the
style
it
really
didnt
stand
out
from
others
i
have
had
there
were
some
good
things
going
on
here
with
the
bread
and
wheat
but
also
some
things
that
it
could
have
done
without
as
in
the
earthiness
while
it
was
nice
to
have
something
different
going
on
it
can
also
hurt
a
brew
unfortunately
worth
trying
at
least
once
to
judge
for
yourself
but
i
doubt
i
will
be
having
it
again
if
i
am
completely
honest
as
there
are
better
easy
to
get
ones
out
there
overall
a
pretty
good
version
of
the
dunkelweizen
style
nice
fruity
esters
and
spicing
the
smoke
adds
a
interesting
kick
samuel
adams
dunkelweizen
pours
a
copper
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
just
what
i
feared
it
would
be
clove
and
banana
my
two
least
favorite
beer
flavors
coming
in
for
the
tag
team
the
taste
is
more
restrained
than
the
nose
with
roasted
barley
and
caramel
malts
working
with
the
banana
and
slight
clove
flavor
along
with
some
nutmeg
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
velvety
and
the
drinkability
is
decent
not
my
favorite
sam
but
its
probably
a
decent
representation
of
a
style
that
isnt
really
for
me
overall
this
beer
is
the
really
good
not
perfect
but
considering
how
easy
it
is
to
get
and
the
quality
brew
that
it
is
love
it
hope
you
enjoy
as
much
as
i
did
salud
o
i
like
to
see
breweries
take
a
shot
at
dunkels
this
one
is
merely
ok
pours
a
muddy
light
brownish
mixed
with
copper
the
half
finger
of
head
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
some
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
troublingly
reminiscent
of
burnt
hair
the
flavor
is
certainly
better
than
the
taste
as
this
offering
has
three
distinct
tastes
that
follow
one
another
first
there
is
a
dry
character
present
second
a
touch
of
sweetness
comes
on
in
the
middle
finally
this
offering
has
a
tart
finish
that
is
not
totally
pleasing
to
the
palate
the
beer
is
a
murky
copper
color
with
a
thick
eggshell
colored
foamy
head
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
clove
and
banana
with
some
pineapple
and
toffee
in
the
background
it
tastes
kind
of
metallic
other
than
that
you
get
the
fruity
banana
and
clove
spice
with
lots
of
wheat
its
medium
bodied
with
lots
of
carbonation
overall
this
beer
is
pretty
average
i
think
they
could
have
done
better
overall
a
unique
refreshing
brew
worth
a
try
o
sam
adams
is
always
my
go
to
when
i
go
to
places
with
slim
pickings
on
the
beer
menu
and
you
cannot
go
wrong
they
a
great
company
that
helped
rekindle
americas
microbrew
renaissance
try
one
on
i
am
a
dunkelweizen
fan
and
you
might
call
this
one
a
little
nontraditional
but
its
nice
well
balanced
with
interesting
taste
notes
it
has
character
a
solid
sam
offering
onot
a
bad
beer
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
but
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
overall
an
easy
drinking
tasty
brew
with
a
good
balance
between
roast
malt
and
sweet
thin
head
on
a
hazy
amber
with
slight
golden
hues
body
sweet
aroma
of
caramel
malts
spices
and
breads
flavor
is
semi
sweet
with
mostly
caramel
malts
hints
of
lemon
spices
a
little
mill
chocolate
light
to
medium
body
and
high
carbonation
the
flavor
in
the
end
is
mostly
sweet
not
very
dynamic
or
memorable
still
drinkable
usually
mouthfeel
crisp
and
slightly
dry
o
this
beer
is
up
my
alley
and
id
be
happy
to
have
another
its
my
first
of
the
style
and
i
dont
assume
its
a
perfect
representation
i
plan
on
having
more
similar
brews
rjt
an
okay
beer
not
a
good
dunkel
o
a
solid
option
in
the
2012
fall
variety
pack
i
think
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
offering
quite
good
glad
to
recommend
o
not
my
favorite
style
this
one
is
a
little
too
dark
fruity
and
sweet
for
me
not
bad
to
style
though
o
one
of
the
better
samuel
adams
ive
had
it
loses
points
on
the
smell
but
its
very
enjoyable
otherwise
o
a
solid
beer
overall
not
the
greatest
or
most
complex
but
tasty
and
drinkable
o
impressive
offering
a
lot
of
flavors
are
mingled
together
but
it
works
well
o
one
of
the
better
options
from
sam
its
nothing
mind
blowing
but
a
well
executed
malt
forward
beer
reccomended
o
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
some
weizens
because
of
my
distaste
for
cloves
however
with
this
beers
lack
of
overpowering
clove
flavor
it
makes
for
a
great
beer
to
welcome
in
the
fall
o
im
a
sucker
for
both
good
dunkels
and
wheat
beer
and
this
one
is
alright
will
drink
again
this
is
my
first
ever
dunkelweizen
and
i
have
to
say
it
tastes
super
fruity
with
all
the
banana
maybe
thats
not
what
this
styles
supposed
to
be
about
but
i
really
do
enjoy
it
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
your
girlfriend
or
wife
would
enjoy
it
really
is
that
fruity
tasting
to
me
while
it
is
a
lot
of
banana
its
not
overpowering
and
thats
why
i
like
it
as
much
as
i
do
as
usual
another
solid
beer
made
by
sam
adams
actually
one
of
my
favorites
from
them
overall
a
thin
interpretation
of
the
style
to
me
to
sweet
in
flavor
and
scent
would
like
to
see
more
yeast
flavor
presence
and
wheat
notes
12oz
bottle
pours
a
cloudy
amber
color
with
a
foamy
cream
colored
head
that
holds
good
retention
but
doesnt
leave
much
for
lacing
aromas
are
yeasty
caramely
banana
spice
clove
with
a
somewhat
odd
woody
smell
tastes
are
better
however
with
banana
yeast
clove
caramel
and
a
nice
spiciness
reminiscent
of
an
oktoberfest
style
beer
mouthfeel
is
the
star
here
creamy
and
smooth
full
bodied
overall
this
was
better
than
i
remember
and
better
than
expected
but
still
falls
short
in
comparison
to
others
of
this
style
odthis
sam
adams
variety
is
pretty
solid
another
tasty
keeper
need
to
go
out
and
try
a
few
more
dunkels
now
overall
a
betterthanaverage
mass
market
wheat
beer
im
always
impressed
that
sam
adams
makes
such
a
wide
variety
of
styles
that
are
more
or
less
faithful
interpretations
of
the
style
this
one
falls
squarely
in
that
category
and
is
definitely
something
ill
be
having
again
complex
delicious
and
very
drinkableeverything
a
good
dunkel
should
be
sam
adams
did
a
nice
job
with
this
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
not
bad
for
a
mixed
pack
but
certainly
not
one
to
seek
out
was
better
looking
and
smelling
than
tasting
o
solid
beer
could
use
some
more
heft
but
the
wateriness
could
be
by
design
this
style
has
always
been
one
i
am
interested
in
picking
up
albeit
occasionally
when
i
am
looking
for
something
different
not
as
a
fridge
foundation
piece
liked
this
beer
but
couldnt
pull
the
trigger
on
higher
ratings
id
probably
try
it
again
though
this
is
basically
just
a
plain
dunkel
that
isnt
to
fancy
but
doesnt
suck
at
the
same
time
i
guess
if
you
wanna
try
the
harvest
variety
pack
youll
do
alright
getting
two
of
these
but
i
would
suggest
if
you
want
to
drink
more
of
this
style
look
to
the
european
versions
youll
be
more
satisfied
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
a
real
outstanding
one
either
i
wish
the
flavors
were
just
a
bit
more
up
front
but
they
are
nice
and
come
forward
a
bit
more
when
warmer
a
nice
beer
for
late
summer
ok
not
must
have
goes
well
with
pauline
oliveros
electronic
drone
music
poured
into
a
samuel
adams
perfect
pint
glass
pours
hazy
light
brown
with
a
large
eggshell
colored
head
there
arent
many
visible
tiny
bubbles
in
the
beer
the
head
retreats
slowly
some
lacing
is
left
on
the
side
of
the
glass
during
consumption
the
aroma
is
prominently
of
banana
with
some
clove
i
can
detect
some
of
the
malt
i
cant
detect
the
nutmeg
that
is
mentioned
on
the
bottle
the
flavors
are
what
youd
expect
in
the
classic
dunkelweizen
there
is
banana
and
clove
from
the
yeast
and
the
wheat
and
barley
malts
provide
a
nice
bready
backbone
to
this
beer
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
low
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
the
drinkabilty
is
high
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wont
avoid
this
in
the
future
but
i
also
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
a
middleoftheroad
interpretation
of
the
style
and
a
tad
watery
for
what
i
would
like
o
definitely
drinkable
but
not
something
id
ever
seek
out
by
sa
not
really
sure
how
this
works
into
the
fall
seasonal
pack
would
like
to
see
it
removed
and
replaced
with
something
else
o
i
enjoy
this
beer
and
would
certainly
accept
some
of
it
idk
if
id
purchase
a
6er
of
it
however
overall
an
enjoyable
beer
that
is
one
of
the
best
american
representations
of
the
style
i
have
tried
only
2
or
3
to
be
fair
not
quite
as
fullbodied
or
carbonated
as
some
ive
had
in
munich
though
pours
a
cloudy
amberhoney
color
with
a
large
fluffy
white
head
which
disappears
quickly
aroma
right
off
the
bat
is
the
expected
banana
and
clove
with
mild
citrus
notes
taste
follows
suit
strong
banana
and
citrus
flavor
mild
clove
slightly
fruity
and
malty
sweet
has
medium
carbonation
not
enough
for
a
true
weizen
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
medium
light
in
body
this
beer
i
feel
is
only
called
a
dunkel
because
its
too
dark
for
a
hefe
and
there
is
no
amber
category
i
prefer
my
dunkels
to
be
more
black
and
i
was
surprised
when
i
first
poured
this
beer
at
its
amber
color
its
a
good
wheat
beer
but
not
a
great
one
bottle
poured
a
clear
amber
color
dunkel
with
a
large
foamy
had
with
good
retention
and
some
light
lacing
aroma
consists
of
banana
cake
ester
are
pretty
strong
with
light
sweet
notes
and
some
what
malt
taste
is
a
good
mix
between
banana
bread
ester
with
light
cloves
and
some
light
wheat
malt
notes
also
discernable
body
is
a
bit
light
for
the
style
with
good
carbonation
nice
work
on
the
yeast
strain
with
huge
ester
but
lacking
body
and
malt
profile
is
a
bit
weak
for
the
style
o
an
interesting
style
that
i
do
not
know
much
about
just
yet
other
than
homebrews
and
failures
to
write
down
notes
on
other
commercial
brews
ill
come
to
this
personally
to
note
changes
easy
drinking
wheaty
brew
smooth
mouth
feel
and
interesting
flavor
characteristics
its
pretty
good
not
fantastic
but
i
will
enjoy
it
and
i
would
have
it
again
this
beer
is
a
rich
amber
chestnut
color
with
an
offwhite
head
the
aroma
has
a
moderate
wheat
twang
with
a
mild
undertone
of
malt
its
not
a
usually
strong
smelling
dunkle
it
could
have
more
fruit
and
esters
the
taste
is
clean
however
and
the
beer
is
semisweet
its
smooth
and
yeasty
some
bread
and
doughy
grain
its
not
as
intense
a
sensation
as
i
expected
mediumfull
in
mouthfeel
ive
come
to
expect
more
from
sam
adams
beers
this
was
average
a
deep
amber
pour
with
a
slight
amount
of
offwhite
head
and
nice
retention
smells
of
dates
grapes
nuts
a
tart
fruitwheat
flavor
not
really
my
thing
has
a
bolognalike
aftertaste
coriander
orange
peel
all
spice
light
body
nice
carbonation
is
making
this
easier
to
gulp
down
and
get
over
with
im
sure
for
the
style
its
not
bad
but
to
me
most
dunkelweizens
are
very
heavy
on
the
weird
bologna
like
aftertaste
not
sure
what
it
is
in
there
that
makes
it
this
way
but
i
dont
like
it
final
thoughts
i
like
what
samuel
adams
is
going
for
here
ive
had
other
beers
of
this
style
that
are
just
overthetop
spicy
but
this
one
seemed
to
dial
in
that
flavor
a
bit
for
optimum
drinkability
and
enjoyment
its
also
one
of
the
more
full
bodied
beers
ive
had
from
them
i
wouldnt
seek
this
out
again
but
if
it
happened
to
be
part
of
a
mix
pack
or
shared
among
friends
i
would
enjoy
it
all
the
same
overall
if
banana
flavour
in
beer
is
your
thing
this
beer
is
for
you
unfortunately
the
banana
tastes
a
little
too
artificial
bit
its
still
an
above
average
brew
worth
a
shot
overall
its
great
on
a
hot
day
doesent
seem
like
a
fall
beer
to
me
but
no
complaints
would
definately
have
again
new
to
the
fall
mix
this
year
is
this
tastz
dark
wheat
brew
appearance
is
nice
brown
and
cloudy
with
a
lively
head
wafting
aroma
of
wheat
malt
clove
home
made
coffee
cake
and
banana
very
well
balanced
and
much
more
happening
on
the
palate
than
the
average
dunkel
the
yeast
is
unique
and
is
the
star
of
the
flavor
experience
its
got
some
vanilla
and
spice
notes
to
it
that
really
support
the
dark
wheat
malt
this
is
one
i
could
easily
drink
a
bunch
of
feel
is
good
plenty
of
body
but
not
at
all
filling
and
proper
carbonation
to
let
the
flavors
evolve
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
fall
pack
ill
be
grabbing
these
up
quick
when
the
box
is
in
the
fridge
overall
worth
trying
one
time
i
wont
buy
it
again
but
it
was
a
decent
brew
i
just
think
it
has
the
deck
stacked
against
it
with
the
quality
of
german
dunkels
that
are
on
the
market
good
effort
though
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
really
worth
seeking
out
pours
hazy
dark
brown
red
with
a
one
finger
white
head
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
wheat
in
the
nose
and
a
slight
fuityness
the
taste
is
pretty
tart
and
wheaty
there
is
a
also
a
lot
of
berry
flavors
and
some
dark
fruits
there
is
also
some
banana
and
clove
this
beer
has
a
somewhat
of
a
bread
flavor
finish
is
tart
dry
and
kind
of
funky
a
solid
beer
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
decent
wack
at
it
o
this
is
my
first
time
having
this
beer
that
i
can
remember
anyways
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
is
a
good
summer
time
beer
not
sure
about
releasing
it
for
your
fall
collection
but
not
complaining
this
is
something
i
will
be
drinking
often
this
fall
cheers
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
has
a
good
flavor
the
yeast
adds
a
nice
banana
peppery
aroma
and
flavor
there
is
also
a
nice
balanced
caramel
sweetness
throughout
not
bad
i
should
have
stopped
after
the
smell
and
i
had
such
high
hopes
for
this
instead
of
making
a
thousand
average
beers
i
wish
sam
adams
would
focus
on
ten
really
exceptional
beers
this
is
just
above
average
and
thats
only
because
i
liked
the
look
and
smell
its
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
drink
and
please
up
the
abv
o
pretty
good
was
looking
for
a
little
more
complexity
in
the
malts
but
has
a
great
creamy
mouthfeel
o
an
average
american
take
on
a
standard
bavarian
classic
its
good
out
of
the
gate
but
eventually
falls
slightly
short
of
the
mark
certainly
a
good
effort
though
and
worth
a
shot
d
12
oz
bottle
from
a
variety
pack
pours

not

a

and
a
bit
creamy
finishing
quick
and
dry
nothing
thrilling
or
complex
but
not
terrible
o
flavor
left
me
slightly
disappointed
and
the
beer
is
too
small
in
body
o
this
is
a
decent
beer
although
the
sweetness
and
medicinal
flavor
combined
to
reduce
my
enjoyment
of
it
as
i
neared
the
end
of
the
glass
still
nothing
to
hold
up
a
purchase
of
the
harvest
12pack
o
a
solid
take
on
a
german
standard
but
with
a
few
lessthanstellar
notes
that
keep
it
from
being
great
that
said
i
did
enjoy
it
and
will
gladly
drink
it
again
every
fall
when
the
craft
pack
comes
out
overall
not
a
bad
effort
from
sammy
adams
here
its
no
world
beater
but
its
certainly
drinkable
and
somewhat
enjoyable
a
little
more
depth
and
complexity
from
the
yeast
would
be
nice
but
im
not
complaining
too
much
its
the
first
dunkel
ive
had
from
an
american
brewery
and
so
by
default
the
best
ive
had
this
side
of
the
atlantic
overall
a
decent
drinking
been
perhaps
i
need
more
exposure
to
dunkelweizens
in
order
to
develop
a
better
critique
of
the
style
overall
it
was
very
nice
but
just
ok
to
be
honest
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
for
this
style
very
flavorful
o
a
pretty
nice
surprise
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
actually
worked
well
on
the
hot
day
i
consumed
it
on
originally
reviewed
09072010
the
taste
starts
with
cloves
then
transitions
to
banana
bread
and
brown
sugar
and
some
darker
brown
bread
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
a
medium
bodied
with
active
carbonation
creamy
but
not
as
full
in
the
mouthfeel
as
most
dunkelweizens
overall
not
too
bad
o
a
lot
of
the
seasonal
sam
adams
beers
arent
very
good
but
this
was
quite
the
opposite
overall
a
pleasant
dunkelweizen
and
a
good
example
of
a
style
you
dont
really
see
everyday
would
not
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
pours
a
medium
to
dark
brown
with
a
white
frothy
head
smells
like
your
typical
wheat
beers
with
a
subtle
hint
of
hops
taste
is
the
most
surprising
part
not
super
bready
but
a
healthy
balance
of
bread
roasty
qualities
with
a
refreshing
finish
overall
a
good
addition
to
the
sam
adams
seasonal
line
this
tasty
beer
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
nearly
opaque
dark
honey
brown
malty
aroma
has
firm
wheaty
and
yeasty
tones
and
a
chocolaty
hint
rich
wheaty
malty
flavor
has
yeasty
nutty
and
caramel
notes
to
round
it
out
fullbodied
texture
is
lively
and
fizzy
enjoyed
this
beer
on
tap
special
draft
release
by
samuel
adams
this
dunkelweizen
poured
a
nice
light
brown
color
it
produced
a
very
nice
thick
tan
head
excellent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
aroma
smelled
of
bananas
cloves
roasted
grain
taste
was
medium
in
body
full
of
malt
banana
and
cloves
easy
to
drink
beer
excellent
session
beer
i
was
glad
i
ordered
it
samuel
adams
never
seems
to
disappoint
for
the
most
part
this
is
enjoyable
something
i
would
not
hesitate
to
drink
again
though
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
and
better
sa
beers
again
enjoyable
and
very
much
worth
a
try
though
the
brew
pours
a
mahogany
hue
and
is
capped
by
a
soapy
tan
head
the
nose
immediately
offers
an
unexpected
roast
and
smoke
note
it
is
not
overdone
but
is
unexpected
as
i
said
the
mainstay
of
the
brews
flavor
and
aroma
is
a
strong
and
sweet
bananabubblegum
flavor
the
bubblegum
note
intensifies
upon
the
finish
the
feel
is
a
tad
lighter
than
medium
and
suits
the
brew
well
enough
i
give
it
points
for
being
complex
and
for
being
a
bananabubblegum
bomb
but
it
is
not
something
i
would
drink
much
of
o
a
solid
and
drinkable
beer
from
sam
medium
carbonation
and
overall
ok
overall
an
ok
brew
though
the
clove
spice
tended
to
stand
out
for
me
not
my
first
spice
choice
that
limits
what
id
pair
this
brew
with
this
beer
pours
out
as
a
earthy
color
of
brown
with
some
highlights
of
yellowish
orange
around
the
edges
the
aroma
has
some
nice
clove
in
there
along
with
the
rational
banana
smells
the
taste
is
mostly
full
of
grains
and
wheat
with
an
aftertaste
of
driedfruits
and
clove
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
much
like
any
other
weizen
its
a
pretty
good
beer
poured
a
medium
brown
in
color
with
a
small
head
that
diminished
rapidly
with
virtually
no
lacing
the
aroma
was
that
of
cloves
and
raisins
with
the
scent
of
grainy
malts
and
an
earthy
yeast
odor
it
tasted
a
little
acidic
and
sweet
with
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
that
only
lasted
a
little
while
mouthfeel
was
smooth
dry
and
medium
bodied
overall
a
tasty
but
average
brew
the
cpj
overall
a
really
solid
beer
and
a
good
example
of
the
style
nicely
done
somewhat
thinner
medium
body
decent
carbonation
and
fair
feel
on
the
palate
okay
drinking
but
a
little
too
sweet
especially
since
nothing
in
particular
stands
out
in
a
positive
manner
overall
no
flavors
tend
to
overpower
the
others
which
is
good
acidity
seems
high
maybe
needs
to
sit
longer
all
of
the
sam
adams
beers
ive
had
in
this
seasonal
mix
pack
have
been
good
but
a
little
lackluster
this
one
is
no
different
not
memorable
d
it
is
good
but
not
really
impressive
crispness
make
it
good
with
a
meal
or
for
any
other
time
you
want
something
quenching
at
the
same
time
it
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
bite
by
the
bottom
of
the
glass
i
would
like
it
a
little
softer
with
more
depth
and
character
this
brew
is
something
of
a
summer
version
of
the
style
with
its
interestingbutnotcomplex
profile
mild
heft
crispness
softly
tart
edge
sam
adams
dunkelweizen
is
easy
drinking
and
a
good
entry
level
dunkelweizen
falls
short
of
the
german
examples
this
beer
was
discovered
as
a
nice
surprise
in
a
mix
pack
in
the
glass
it
presented
as
a
nice
milky
unfiltered
beer
the
initial
smell
gave
great
citrus
and
malty
notes
that
complemented
each
other
rather
then
competed
over
all
a
nice
darkish
beer
with
a
great
mouth

this

there
are

better

out

it
tastes
about
right
for

the

not
my

but
this
was
tasty
and
balanced
purchased
fred
meyerballard
seattle
on
8312010
not
half
bad
the
buttery
tone
does
take
away
from
the
other
yeast
characteristics
my
taste
buds
were
waiting
for
drinkability
i
liked
it
i
really
could
drink
this
again
if
sam
adams
started
selling
this
in
6packs
i
would
buy
it
d
just
too
sweet
to
enjoy
more
than
one
not
up
to
par
with
the
great
german
representations
of
the
style
wonder
if
this
is
the
dark
wheat
recipe
they
used
to
brew
years
back
i
used
to
drink
that
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
theyre
the
same
the
flavors
of
the
malt
have
a
pleasant
toasted
quality
and
mild
earthy
element
w
subtle
weizen
spice
tinge
and
light
tang
of
tropical
fruit
the
flavors
are
married
well
with
thte
slight
caramel
in
the
malt
w
wheat
especially
notable
in
the
taste
and
mild
dark
brown
sugar
in
the
finish
which
is
semidry
a
good
dunkelweizen
i
was
not
expecting
as
much
flavor
since
samuel
adams
other
wheats
have
not
impressed
me
but
i
liked
the
flavor
and
found
it
enjoyable
throughout
the
bottle
i
would
probably
order
it
again
since
i
liked
it
better
than
the
hefe
drinkability
maybe
would
get
a
little
bored
d
nicely
palatable
but
as
far
as
drinkability
in
concerned
this
is
what
i
would
consider
to
be
exactly
average
d
i
liked
this
beer
but
it
was
average
at
best
a
nice
drinker
with
a
low
abv
making
it
easy
to
drink
a
sixer
of
it
if
given
the
chance
another
above
average
beer
from
sam
adams
wow
this
is
truly
a
unique
beer
is
it
a
dunkel
is
it
a
porter
who
knows
but
besides
the
quandary
of
categorization
this
is
a
great
dark
beer
ive
never
tried
before
for
a
dark
beer
it
has
almost
a
lager
feel
and
taste
to
it
minimal
head
beautiful
molasses
color
and
a
wonderful
taste
the
only
knock
on
this
brew
is
that
it
could
hae
a
better
aroma
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
good
poundable
beer
with
flavor
and
substance
making
it
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
pours
a
murky
brownish
amber
color
with
a
head
that
is
almost
nonexistent
no
carbonation
to
speak
of
smell
is
sort
of
sour
and
herbal
like
potpourri
taste
is
nicely
complex
crisp
and
aromatic
with
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
sour
and
bitter
finishes
crisp
and
satisfying
with
a
mildly
tart
aftertaste
lots
of
flavor
notes
in
the
profile
from
spices
to
fruits
drinkability
is
decent
d
easy
to
drink
nothing
special
just
a
decent
beer
purchased
by
my
dad
as
part
of
a
mixed
sam
adams
12
pack
containing
6
different
beers
pours
a
cloudy
copperbrown
colour
with
fairly
thick
offwhite
head
some
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
banana
clove
and
toasted
caramel
malt
taste
is
fairly
sweet
no
real
bitterness
this
paired
quite
well
with
the
ribs
we
were
eating
d
plenty
drinkable
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
this
is
an
easy
beer
to
drink
but
overall
was
not
overly
impressive
id
certainly
drink
it
again
but
would
not
seek
it
out
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
copperish
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
the
aroma
i
can
describe
as
a
german
wheat
funkiness
the
taste
is
of
a
sweet
estery
beer
tastes
funky
like
something
foreign
maybe
you
could
describe
it
as
cloves
and
bananas
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
as
for
the
drinkability
i
would
have
to
say
im
happy
with
having
to
have
tried
this
one
at
least
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
somewhat
odd
ive
had
a
few
dunkels
before
and
this
one
has
the
lowest
abv
but
the
taste
is
similar
the
problem
is
that
the
flavor
comes
on
strong
and
then
seems
to
muddle
the
different
components
together
in
a
way
that
just
confuse
my
taste
buds
the
flavors
mix
in
an
unsophisticated
way
i
probably
wont
have
this
one
too
frequently
smooth
bready
wheat
malt
up
front
toasted
edges
around
banana
tropical
fruit
and
clove
midpalate
banana
bread
richness
and
some
sweetness
near
the
finish
very
light
noble
hop
notes
with
lingering
clove
sweetbread
and
yeast
pretty
taste
all
around
medium
to
full
body
with
nice
even
carbonation
to
give
it
a
creamy
feel
better
than
i
expected
all
in
all
a
great
coolcold
weather
beer
from
the
bbc
this
would
actually
be
a
great
one
to
offer
all
throughout
the
fall
and
winter
months
beer
is
thin
and
has
a
pretty
dominant
aftertaste
of
wheat
and
wet
grains
the
midpalate
is
mildly
sweet
and
fruity
it
got
better
the
more
i
drank
and
the
further
my
standards
for
the
beer
i
had
in
hand
and
i
easily
finished
it
but
it
was
my
only
beer
last
night
and
i
was
left
pretty
disappointed
i
wont
bother
again
there
are
literally
dozens
of
better
dunkelweisses
out
there
d
refreshing
and
a
bit
enjoyable
but
missing
some
key
qualities
that
makes
the
good
ones
great
a
nice
and
different
addition
to
the
sa
samplers
which
i
will
look
forward
to
again
eh
this
could
be
a
lot
better
not
a
bad
beer
but
missing
something
the
beer
pours
a
reddishamber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
basic
dunkelweizen
with
some
caramel
toffee
banana
and
clove
notes
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
bananas
and
cloves
as
well
as
some
caramel
malt
vanilla
and
brown
sugar
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
slightly
water
medium
carbonation
d
nothing
special
here
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
but
i
dont
want
another
average
at
best
i
think
this
one
is
too
carbonated
i
know
this
style
is
highly
carbonated
but
this
one
kind
of
explodes
in
the
mouth
like
soda
and
isnt
pleasant
refreshing
or
palate
cleansing
i
didnt
really
enjoy
this
one
that
much
average
at
best
by
the
time
your
glass
is
halfempty
carbonation
has
reached
a
sweet
spot
and
youll
find
the
flavor
carnival
much
more
palatable
at
this
point
youll
nod
to
the
sam
adams
brewmaster
and
say
i
see
what
youre
trying
to
do
here
d
man
i
dont
know
what
they
created
but
it
seems
to
be
a
great
brew
filled
with
fruit
clove
and
wheat
flavorings
it
is
complex
and
original
as
mass
produced
a
very
good
brew
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
this
one
the
taste
is
one
of
the
most
unique
that
i
have
had
in
a
beer
it
is
also
one
that
i
did
not
like
i
has
a
weird
sweetness
to
it
that
i
cant
place
to
me
it
was
almost
like
cantelpope
that
was
past
ripeness
it
also
finished
with
a
really
odd
aftertaste
that
i
cant
describe
i
know
that
doesnt
help
but
i
just
cant
place
it
although
it
looks
good
in
the
glass
it
didnt
have
a
multibeer
drink
ability
that
i
like
to
be
sure
i
had
two
and
the
second
didnt
go
down
any
better
than
the
first
it
is
obvious
from
the
mostly
favorable
reviews
that
i
am
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
spectrum
on
this
one
though
a
bit
mild
for
an
american
dunkelweizen
this
beer
still
manages
to
feature
most
of
the
classic
characteristics
if
you
dont
like
bold
dry
beers
then
this
one
probably
isnt
for
you
though
i
didnt
explicitly
dislike
this
beer
i
couldnt
find
anything
about
it
that
i
really
really
liked
the
boston
beer
company
made
a
good
attempt
at
crafting
this
style
but
i
dont
think
that
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
look
for
this
particular
beer
in
the
future
overall
a
very
solid
fall
brew
from
the
bbc
d
drinks
very
nicely
complex
without
being
too
rich
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
from
the
boston
beer
co
i
am
pleasantly
surprised
to
say
the
least
pours
a
hazy
orangeish
to
copper
color
with
a
small
white
head
in
the
aroma
small
fruitiness
a
small
roast
and
wheat
notes
in
the
taste
roasty
wheat
like
hints
and
an
underlying
fruitiness
a
smooth
a
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
fruity
aftertaste
nice
representation
of
style
but
not
too
overwhelming
in
impressiveness
d
very
drinkable
but
not
impressive
overall
not
bad
for
dunkelweizen
overall
a
good
stab
at
a
style
most
americans
never
try
bbc
makes
another
attempt
at
a
style
that
keeps
most
craft
drinkers
happy
while
not
alienating
the
typical
marcro
drinker
i
just
wished
it
had
that
creamy
wheat
feel
i
get
from
most
german
made
wheat
beers
i
probably
would
not
drink
this
beer
again
unless
i
didnt
have
any
other
real
beer
options
d
this
is
pretty
nice
dunkel
weizen
however
i
prefer
a
true
german
dunkelweizen
d
its
really
solid
a
good
earlyfall
drinker
id
love
to
see
this
one
in
a
sixer
as
its
good
enough
to
session
tailgate
beer
perhaps
this
one
really
exceded
expectations
unfortunately
my
experience
with
american
weizen
beers
kind
of
fall
short
of
the
banana
and
clove
features
from
the
yeast
this
one
was
pretty
spoton
d
i
would
definitely
pick
up
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
im
already
looking
forward
to
another
one
picked
up
a
sa
harvest
twelve
pack
to
try
the
dunkel
and
the
pumpkin
poured
into
a
stemmed
glass
very
light
brown
color
with
a
moderate
sized
white
head
smell
had
a
bit
of
freshly
baked
bread
aroma
to
it
taste
was
good
as
i
enjoyed
the
banana
and
clove
flavor
and
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
malt
the
one
flaw
i
found
with
this
beer
was
the
mouthfeel
it
was
extremely
thin
borderline
watery
not
pleasing
in
the
mouth
drinkability
was
nice
as
i
found
this
beer
to
be
smooth
and
low
in
abv
a
nice
take
on
the
style
but
id
say
stick
to
the
germans
if
you
have
a
craving
for
a
great
dunkel
this
one
just
didnt
impress
me
that
much
drinkability
meh
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
really
nothing
i
would
seek
out
just
really
kind
of
watery
and
weak
in
the
end
pours
a
hazy
amber
orange
color
with
a
thick
three
finger
slightly
brown
orange
head
which
has
nice
retention
but
not
a
lot
of
lacing
the
aroma
has
a
caramel
and
bready
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
clove
and
banana
fruitiness
over
the
top
the
fruit
is
haint
but
there
taste
has
a
nice
caramel
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
toastiness
and
breadiness
there
is
a
faint
banana
and
clove
flavor
with
a
small
hop
bite
at
the
very
end
there
is
a
sweet
balance
on
the
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
carbonated
and
a
tad
dry
the
drinkability
is
good
it
is
an
easy
drink
with
a
well
rounded
flavor
with
hints
of
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
rough
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
deasy
to
drink
but
not
the
best
replica
of
a
dunkelweizen
d
ok
drinkability
this
wasnt
too
high
on
the
abv
scale
and
the
flavors
were
all
there
perhaps
if
i
let
it
mature
a
bit
it
would
be
better
drinability
is
bleh
too
some
sticky
mouth
feel
and
bad
lingering
tastes
pours
a
hazy
amber
orangish
color
light
to
dark
progression
with
a
touch
of
foam
that
settles
virtually
out
mild
banana
smell
hints
of
spice
some
malt
taste
is
like
a
rich
hefe
nicely
balanced
with
a
light
sour
close
wheaty
mouthfeel
with
decent
carbonation
pretty
good
quite
drinkable
nice
beer
d
this
is
pretty
disappointing
flavorwise
very
little
complexity
or
character
although
theres
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
it
too
light
and
basic
to
be
anything
more
than
decent
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
mild
brown
the
head
is
white
and
tall
at
first
but
settles
to
a
thin
film
of
tight
bubbles
pretty
quickly
but
leaves
a
bit
of
nice
lace
on
the
way
down
the
smell
is
a
bit
faint
but
of
clove
banana
and
yeasty
esters
the
grain
note
is
wheaty
with
wheat
bread
coming
to
mind
the
taste
is
mainly
clean
crisp
grain
with
a
touch
of
the
banana
and
clove
overall
probably
too
light
and
too
clean
the
finish
is
dry
with
a
touch
of
lingering
banana
and
apple
while
the
body
is
crisp
and
light
i
would
prefer
something
a
bit
fuller
drinkability
is
ok
this
isnt
the
best
of
the
style
or
the
best
beer
with
sam
adams
on
the
bottle
but
its
different
and
that
alone
wins
it
a
few
points
d
a
little
to
sweet
sour
finish
its
not
my
favorite
in
the
fall
beer
selection
of
brews
was
in
the
harvest
mix
pack
and
it
does
suit
the
fall
season
with
its
slightly
dark
spice
nose
mixed
in
with
bananas
and
pumpkins
add
to
it
the
low
abv
for
the
style
and
you
have
a
great
session
beer
for
autumn
evenings
not
too
sweet
and
not
overly
complex
it
scores
points
for
being
very
drinkable
drinkability
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
seems
closer
to
a
fall
seasonal
due
to
the
pumpkin
taste
but
not
bad
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
brown
color
64
inch
head
of
an
offwhite
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
slight
hop
sweet
malt
yeast
wheat
slight
alcohol
hint
of
citrus
hint
of
clove
and
a
hint
of
grain
fits
the
style
of
a
dunkelweizen
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
sweet
malt
pale
malt
yeast
clove
slight
hop
hint
of
alcohol
and
wheat
overall
good
appearance
aroma
body
and
blend
this
beer
was
poured
into
a
pint
glass
in
anticipation
of
my
oktoberfest
celebration
the
appearance
is
beautiful
pours
dark
lightens
up
and
has
a
nice
white
lace
head
the
nose
is
pure
cloves
it
nice
but
pure
cloves
the
taste
is
sweet
and
some
slight
spiciness
nothing
great
on
the
the
mouthfeel
and
in
my
opinion
the
sweetness
of
the
brew
takes
away
from
the
drinkability
this
beer
was
decent
until
the
last
couple
ounces
where
it
went
from
decent
to
undesirable
not
terrible
but
a
pretty
lifeless
very
messy
interpretation
of
the
style
drinkability
it
isnt
bad
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
too
much
emphasis
on
the
banana
and
yeast
not
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
overall
this
beer
was
a
let
down
i
love
this
style
but
sam
adams
didnt
give
it
the
justice
it
deserves
everything
about
this
beer
felt
held
back
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
drink
some
good
german
examples
for
inspiration
wont
be
getting
this
again
i
would
love
to
find
this
in
a
6
pack
but
unfortunately
it
came
in
one
of
those
sampler
packs
so
go
pick
one
of
those
up
sam
adams

bit
murky
with
some
yeast
chunks
on
the
pour
aroma
is
subtle
with
very
limited
caramel
and
yeast
influence
a
few
months
on
the
bottle
but
still
within
range
and
a
bit
of
a
let
down
no
modification
on
scores
this
is
what
i
wish
sa
would
do
more
of
try
some
more
unique
styles
a
nice
clovey
malty
aroma
the
taste
is
cloves
but
also
hops
that
ends
drier
then
i
expected
which
makes
this
a
very
easy
to
drink
brew
its
not
a
classic
example
of
the
style
buts
thats
ok
we
need
more
out
of
the
box
attempts
from
sa
this
one
has
a
nice
malty
sweetness
that
would
do
well
if
they
put
then
out
in
6packs
poured
into
a
sam
adams
perfect
pint
glass
comes
out
an
amberish
type
color
small
off
white
head
that
goes
away
very
quickly
no
lacing
to
it
more
clarity
than
i
expected
slight
haze
but
not
much
really
smell
is
the
best
part
in
my
opinion
very
herbal
with
some
touches
of
some
yeast
in
there
cloves
and
a
slight
banana
smell
to
it
wheats
and
malted
barley
give
it
a
slight
sweet
smell
to
it
taste
is
good
to
very
breadywheaty
yeast
also
very
present
the
clove
and
banana
flavors
are
there
again
there
are
certainly
some
caramelized
malts
provide
sweetness
there
isnt
a
hop
flavor
but
there
is
some
bitterness
to
it
mouthfeel
is
good
good
carbonation
level
and
a
good
balance
of
bitterness
and
sweetness
medium
bodied
drinkability
is
good
d
refreshing
but
sweet
and
tasty
a
real
treat
and
among
the
better
sa
choices
this
beer
pours
a
darker
cloudy
amber
color
with
very
little
head
the
beer
has
a
good
banna
smell
to
it
the
flavor
is
rather
complex
a
smooth
wheat
flavor
with
hints
of
banna
and
clove
nice
flavors
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
beer
with
nice
flavors
would
get
again
the
pour
is
darkish
ambercopper
with
about
an
inch
of
cream
colored
head
yes
theres
banana
and
clove
but
i
got
an
overwhelming
musty
grass
aroma
some
breadiness
in
the
taste
as
well
as
the
requisite
banana
and
clove
but
the
musty
funk
carried
over
from
the
scent
and
incorporated
itself
into
the
flavor
it
almost
presents
as
a
sour
note
theres
just
something
about
the
smell
and
taste
that
really
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
quite
a
bit
of
carbonation
but
it
had
the
feeling
of
some
thickness
after
it
went
down
which
was
a
plus
i
wont
go
looking
for
this
again
final
thoughts
two
thumbs
up
would
reccomend
and
would
by
a
6
pack
if
i
can
find
one
this
beer
was
a
part
of
the
harvest
collection
mix
pack
drinks
easy
delivers
a
lot
of
flavor
for
the
abv
not
the
best
dunkelweizen
out
there
but
respectable
enough
hmm
not
sure
where
this
one
went
but
i
wasnt
a
huge
fan
there
was
a
sour
element
to
this
that
seemed
to
throw
me
off
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
weizen
glass
pours
the
color
and
clarity
of
unpasteurized
apple
cider
with
a
dense
one
inch
creamy
offwhite
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
with
thick
swaths
of
lacing
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
expresses
dark
fruit
and
yeast
taste
follows
nose
however
flavors
are
a
bit
more
muted
and
there
is
a
suggestion
of
bubblegum
as
well
as
a
slightly
bready
quality
that
presents
towards
the
back
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
a
pleasant
even
background
carbonation
a
solid
and
easy
drinking
dunkel
would
love
to
see
this
one
added
into
the
regular
rotation
as
a
seasonal
overall
this
is
a
plain
beer
that
presents
its
style
but
doesnt
do
anything
great
pours
out
a
cloudy
light
bown
color
with
no
yeast
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
impressive
smells
like
a
fresh
wheat
beer
slightly
spicey
but
more
phenolic
with
hints
of
banana
and
vanilla
also
smells
slightly
bready
which
is
spot
on
for
a
dunkel
taste
is
more
clove
banana
and
mouthfeel
is
crisp
on
the
tonque
with
adequate
carbonation
the
notes
on
the
bottle
say
that
this
is
a
traditional
bavarian
yeast
strain
and
yet
this
beer
taste
mildly
familiar
which
makes
me
wonder
where
are
you
getting
the
yeast
jim
weih
something
d
an
average
dunkelweixen
certainly
not
the
best
but
i
would
never
turn
this
down
if
offered
moreys
bottom
line
ive
only
had
a
handful
of
beers
in
this
style
but
this
is
a
pretty
good
one
the
only
one
that
i
like
better
is
great
lakes
glockenspiel
its
obvious
that
this
beer
is
well
crafted
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
a
couple
inches
of
off
white
head
it
is
a
hazy
dark
amber
bordering
on
copper
color
the
aroma
is
bananas
and
clove
the
taste
is
bananas
and
cloves
at
first
then
i
get
a
real
carbonation
bite
i
get
some
caramel
malt
in
there
too
this
beer
seems
overcarbonated
to
me
this
is
only
my
second
dunkelweizen
but
i
prefer
my
previous
selection
a
good
brew
but
nothing
i
would
seek
out
or
buy
if
it
were
a
stand
alone
beer
not
in
a
variety
pack
d
very
high
d
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
though
i
did
enjoy
it
i
dont
think
id
have
another
soon
after
in
comparison
to
other
dunkels
especially
those
from
germany
this
one
doesnt
seem
to
match
up
it
lacks
that
balance
of
crisp
wheat
deliciousness
with
the
darker
notes
that
most
dunkelweizens
have
the
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
average
carbonation
a
slight
coat
persists
that
feels
like
a
wet
film
it
isnt
very
sticky
or
flavorful
this
individual
bottle
drinks
well
but
because
it
is
only
available
in
a
mixed
12
pack
i
have
to
limit
the
drinkability
i
wouldnt
buy
the
whole
thing
just
to
get
two
bottles
of
this
beer
id
rather
try
another
brewerys
product
if
it
because
available
on
its
own
id
be
more
likely
to
seek
this
one
out
a
second
time
pretty
thin
and
weak
for
a
dunkel
seek
others
disappointing
d
not
a
bad
dunkelweizen
features
all
of
the
flavors
i
am
familiar
with
in
a
hefe
maybe
a
little
sweeter
than
normal
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
after
the
aroma
light
with
bubbly
carbonation
the
feeling
is
way
too
thin
for
a
dunkel
though
and
drags
things
down
the
fruitiness
is
most
prevalent
in
the
taste
with
hints
of
banana
i
liked
this
beer
but
im
not
in
love
with
it
maybe
well
just
date
occasionally
d
yes
its
drinkable
and
i
could
have
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
i
wanted
but
it
remains
to
me
just
an
average
beer
at
best
theres
nothing
offensive
about
it
at
all
but
leaves
me
feeling
like
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
d
not
a
terrible
beer
but
the
flavors
just
werent
as
vivid
as
they
are
in
good
dunkelweizens
pours
a
hazy
copper
with
a
small
off
white
head
theres
some
lacing
but
not
very
much
the
smell
is
malt
and
some
breadiness
with
a
little
banana
and
cloves
the
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
then
some
wheat
and
lemon
flavor
along
with
some
spices
theres
a
little
banana
in
the
taste
but
its
fairly
faint
medium
bodied
and
smooth
in
terms
of
carbonation
very
drinkable
to
where
it
could
be
a
session
beer
if
dunkelweizens
are
your
thing
overall
this
is
an
ok
dunkelweizen
though
sa
needs
to
work
on
the
haze
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
really
nice
wheat
malt
scent
along
with
a
delicate
hefe
yeast
aroma
and
a
touch
of
caramel
sweetness
it
has
excellent
yeast
character
with
only
a
minimal
crystal
malt
contribution
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pale
wheat
and
caramel
malt
flavor
its
dry
with
a
moderate
caramel
sweetness
and
plenty
of
yeast
esters
the
bananaclove
character
is
ever
present
with
a
pretty
slick
malt
profile
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinking
dunkel
its
not
as
sweet
as
some
but
the
caramel
malt
taste
is
there
d
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
beer
not
sure
i
could
do
more
than
a
couple
due
to
the
strong
flavors
and
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a
smooth
amount
of
carbonation
d
out
of
all
the
beers
in
the
harvest
collection
12pack
i
was
probably
looking
forward
to
this
one
the
most
so
that
may
account
for
much
of
my
disappointment
unfortunately
this
is
basically
an
american
pale
wheat
ale
with
dark
malt
im
not
sure
who
boston
beer
is
trying
to
impress
with
this
one
because
its
too
dark
for
the
masses
and
too
bland
for
craft
drinkers
that
being
said
its
an
easygoing
beer
for
mindless
drinking
which
i
suppose
bumps
up
the
drinkability
score
by
a
half
point
d
this
is
like
falls
version
of
the
hefe
darkermaltier
but
still
with
that
clovey
banana
notes
overall
i
like
the
idea
but
this
version
is
alright
d
not
really
hitting
the
mark
of
a
true
german
dunkelweizen
but
its
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
like
most
sa
beers
its
tame
in
its
flavor
and
does
an
average
job
at
hitting
the
style
but
with
its
low
alcohol
makes
it
a
decent
session
beer
look
is
heavy
on
the
dunkel
everything
else
drives
home
the
weizen
a
tight
persistent
khaki
cap
sits
on
a
hazy
caramel
pour
like
an
unfiltered
yuengling
the
smell
screams
german
hefe
yeast
with
a
decent
dose
of
funk
a
word
ive
never
used
in
relation
to
a
sam
brew
and
earth
to
burn
the
first
sip
feels
surprisingly
slick
but
the
sweetish
finish
hangs
on
longer
as
the
glass
warms
the
hops
are
appropriately
restrained
to
let
a
decent
yeast
strain
shine
though
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
a
deeper
malt
platform
a
good
drinkable
american
effort
though
not
a
contender
to
the
german
big
boys
bottle
with
a
layer
of
fine
yeast
in
the
bottom
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
one
finger
of
offwhite
foam
that
lasts
about
30
seconds
aromas
are
predominately
of
toasty
wheat
and
yeast
with
a
fair
amount
of
cloves
first
thing
that
jumps
out
to
me
is
not
how
the
beer
tastes
but
how
it
feels
texturally
as
with
with
many
sam
adams
it
is
nearly
perfect
a
medium
body
is
carbonated
such
that
it
feels
electric
at
first
and
becomes
sumptuously
smooth
as
it
washes
over
the
tongue
the
flavors
are
certainly
good
and
consistent
with
the
nose
and
is
just
a
tad
less
complex
and
interesting
than
those
of
my
favorite
dunkelweizens
drinkability
just
decent
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
very
exciting
either
i
was
excited
to
try
this
but
ultimately
was
dissapointed
i
think
sa
borrowed
too
much
from
its
now
deceased
hefeweizen
to
create
this
dunkelweiss
d
i
liked
this
beer
would
go
for
it
at
a
party
or
something
but
would
not
go
apeshit
over
it
a
decent
dark
dunkle
that
needs
more
wheat
as
far
as
smell
goes
the
presence
of
tropical
fruit
and
some
clove
spice
brought
to
mind
apricots
covered
in
clove
pretty
nice
taste
was
less
satisfying
not
much
on
the
fruit
or
bready
end
of
things
but
rather
boldlycrisp
and
quite
spicy
i
could
have
wished
for
some
hints
of
banana
i
would
have
been
pleased
with
a
fuller
mouth
feel
as
well
overall
a
nice
and
easy
dark
wheat
beer
not
exceptional
but
not
bad
either
ddark
hefeweizen
or
light
dunkelweizen
this
beer
is
nice
and
drinkable
but
not
as
flavorful
as
it
could
be
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
copper
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
fruits
cloves
and
spices
taste
is
good
banana
cloves
fruits
lots
of
flavor
feels
full
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
worth
seeking
out
the
beer
pours
with
almost
no
lacing
it
starts
out
as
a
ruby
brown
at
the
top
and
gets
progressively
lighter
until
it
ends
in
a
ruby
orange
bottom
the
smell
is
citrus
and
spice
nutmeg
clove
allspice
a
hint
of
yeast
that
of
what
you
would
use
tor
rise
bread
fruit
cakeish
the
flavor
has
the
smooth
creamyness
banana
flavor
and
the
tartsweetness
of
apple
spicedbread
pumpkinbread
clove
mild
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
decent
smooth
on
the
tongue
despite
some
carbonation
bite
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
drinkability
is
passable
better
of
two
dunkelwizens
ive
had
overall
this
one
isnt
bad
for
a
lighter
beer
in
the
harest
variety
pack
it
tastes
way
too
boozey
for
me
still
better
than
cherry
wheat
or
the
horrid
cranberry
lambic
though
pours
a
light
brown
color
with
a
1
white
head
that
remained
for
a
while
and
left
a
little
bit
of
lacing
in
the
glass
smells
wheatey
with
a
little
bit
of
banana
and
clove
as
expected
i
also
think
i
detect
a
little
bit
of
spice
taste
is
good
its
an
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
its
wheatey
with
the
banana
and
cloves
with
the
spice
like
the
smell
but
the
wheaty
taste
is
a
little
toasty
and
malty
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
with
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
i
would
definitely
buy
these
if
you
could
get
them
outside
of
the
sam
adams
harvest
seasonal
pack
i
enjoy
wheat
beers
and
this
was
a
nice
variation
its
a
little
darker
and
denser
for
the
fall
or
winter
months
than
a
hefeweizen
or
wit
but
it
retains
that
refreshing
feeling
taste
once
again
its
very
close
to
its
german
counterparts
doesnt
seem
to
have
the
same
depth
of
flavor
and
complexity
of
the
best
examples
of
this
style
d
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
in
the
harvest
mix
pack
very
drinkable
this
one
really
hit
the
spot
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
fall
probably
my
vote
for
the
weakest
in
the
fall
harvest
pack
for
this
year
this
being
the
weakest
makes
it
a
pretty
good
12
pack
drinkability
another
solid
specialty
offering
from
sam
adams
this
one
is
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
but
is
good
for
the
style
if
they
released
this
in
sixes
i
would
pick
one
up
picked
up
this
years
sa
harvest
sampler
pack
which
has
a
fine
selection
of
sa
brews
you
only
get
two
of
each
beer
and
in
this
case
it
is
both
a
good
and
bad
thing
while
the
dunkelweizen
has
all
the
right
tastes
and
traits
they
are
all
muted
the
flavors
are
here
they
are
just
light
a
good
beer
to
try
on
noobs
to
german
wheat
beers
but
its
no
good
for
a
pro
d
over
all
mouth
feel
deteriorates
flavor
stays
though
the
whole
bottle
is
enjoyed
the
aroma
is
true
to
the
style
fruity
wheat
grainy
and
spicy
the
appearance
is
a
cloudy
amber
color
a
decent
size
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
the
flavor
is
spicy
grainy
wheat
dark
fruit
the
mouth
feel
is
a
little
thin
with
high
carbonation
the
finish
is
clean
with
lingering
cloves
and
mild
hops
my
first
dunkelweizen
so
i
dont
have
anything
to
compare
it
too
it
was
very
pleasant
though
it
is
one
of
the
better
offerings
that
i
have
had
from
sam
adams
light
to
medium
bodied
with
slightly
above
average
carbonation
fairly
drinkable
the
problem
is
youd
lose
interest
before
sessioning
became
a
possibility
t
a
simple
flavor
slightly
dark
but
mostly
clean
and
refreshing
absolutely
evokes
the
german
style
a
solid
if
not
spectacular
offering
d
not
impressed
better
german
beers
out
there
for
this
style
d
not
one
of
bbcs
better
efforts
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
overall
it
lacks
some
body
and
complexity
as
i
mentioned
earlier
but
that
helped
this
beer
for
me
another
fantastic
beer
from
samuel
adams
overall
a
solid
effort
fo
the
style
although
not
something
ill
necessarily
be
looking
for
in
its
own
sixers
recommended
of
sorts
d
a
slightly
above
average
version
at
least
they
used
the
traditional
yeast
which
was
not
apparent
in
their
hefeweizen
a
nice
brew
but
not
a
reason
to
buy
the
harvest
collection
d
3
54
started
off
much
more
promisingly
than
it
ended
yet
still
competent
a
pretty
good
brew
but
i
wouldve
liked
them
to
amp
up
the
roasty
bitterness
a
bit
this
tastes
practically
like
a
regular
hefeweizen
that
being
said
a
fine
brew
for
the
fall
and
a
worthy
addition
to
the
sampler
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
thanks
to
the
pleasing
taste
sam
adams
did
a
great
job
on
the
kellerweis
hefeweizen
but
i
feel
that
they
went
a
little
too
safe
on
this
one
its
too
clean
in
terms
of
looks
and
taste
to
stack
up
to
its
german
counterparts
but
is
by
no
means
a
terrible
dunkelweizen
a
good
solid
beer
thats
still
head
and
shoulders
above
90
of
the
crap
sold
out
there
pours
a
light
brown
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
nice
head
smells
of
cloves
and
wheat
yeast
which
smell
i
love
the
taste
is
light
refreshing
and
wheaty
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
about
this
basic
wheat
beer
other
than
that
its
delicious
and
very
drinkable
di
love
a
good
dunkelweizen
but
this
falls
short
in
my
book
id
like
a
bit
more
malt
richness
a
good
bit
more
actually
also
the
banana
esters
could
be
stronger
on
the
taste
too
also
missing
a
spicy
element
i
also
expect
this
could
be
improved
a
lot
dark
amberorange
in
color
topped
with
white
bubbly
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
caramel
slight
spiced
fruit
and
cloves
malt
in
the
taste
cloves
spices
carrots
bananas
ride
out
the
finish
light
in
body
and
carbonation
a
strange
sweet
drink
that
is
rather
annoying
to
finish
its
pretty
good
pour
is
a
deep
orange
color
with
a
touch
of
maroon
in
there
surprisingly
light
for
a
dunkel
head
is
solid
with
a
touch
of
lacing
nose
is
tasty
strong
somewhat
spicy
wheat
dominates
with
a
touch
of
general
fruity
malt
sweetness
flavor
is
likewise
more
of
a
straightup
wheat
beer
than
anything
unique
this
again
has
a
lightly
biting
wheat
sweetness
a
touch
of
fruitiness
and
maybe
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
back
end
nice
quite
drinkable
brew
overall
another
solid
entry
by
sam
adams
although
this
one
is
maybe
a
little
off
in
terms
of
the
true
dunkel
style
im
not
a
fan
of
this
one
weinhenstephaner
has
a
much
much
better
example
good
drinkability
but
could
be
better
with
a
tad
more
flavour
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
that
would
be
a
good
way
to
introduce
someone
to
it
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
if
there
were
other
examples
available
still
its
tasty
and
its
worth
a
try
i
recommend
it
on
these
merits
alone
poured
into
a
new
york
new
york
wheat
glass
a
hazey
brown
with
a
thick
froathy
head
the
scent
coming
off
of
it
is
banana
cloves
and
belgian
yeast
strong
on
the
belgian
yeast
and
spices
the
taste
isnt
a
strong
as
what
the
nose
would
lead
you
to
expect
everything
that
the
nose
found
can
be
found
on
the
tongue
banana
cloves
and
belgian
yeast
add
in
some
carmel
and
youve
got
a
nice
little
dunkel
here
but
the
flavors
just
dont
have
any
pop
to
them
i
would
like
to
have
some
more
sugary
flavors
in
this
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
high
in
the
carbonation
d
easy
drinking
sessionable
with
clean
flavors
ill
happily
drink
the
second
one
that
came
in
my
mix
pack
but
i
think
there
are
better
dunkelweizens
worth
picking
up
on
a
regular
basis
copper
colored
brew
pretty
hazy
medium
sized
cream
colored
head
the
main
scent
is
wheat
grains
and
darker
malts
same
for
the
taste
a
predominantly
wheat
grain
taste
with
a
darker
malt
infusion
unfortunately
the
taste
doesnt
really
evolve
much
beyond
that
not
that
its
bad
per
se
its
just
fairly
onedimensional
thinner
bodied
overall
its
certainly
not
bad
its
just
alright
dan
easy
drinker
for
sure
but
weizen
yeasts
just
arent
really
my
thing
im
just
not
a
fan
of
the
esters
that
are
characteristic
of
these
beers
pours
a
dark
semi
cloudy
brownish
red
color
with
a
very
faint
head
that
dissipates
quickly
obviously
not
bottle
conditioned
nor
was
there
any
yeast
sediment
in
the
bottle
disappointing
appearance
aroma
is
true
to
german
dunkleweizens
with
rich
toffee
banana
and
a
touch
of
croissant
breadyness
really
typical
but
nothing
jumping
out
the
taste
however
is
right
on
par
with
what
i
am
looking
for
big
bold
lemony
banana
and
toffee
flavors
with
a
bright
acidity
that
wakes
up
the
palate
fresh
flavors
of
banana
peel
orange
zest
and
maybe
some
milk
chocolate
mouthfeel
works
for
me
its
carbonated
well
just
not
like
traditional
dunkleweizens
has
a
solid
level
of
dryness
on
the
finish
but
that
typical
touch
of
sweetness
to
balance
it
out
drinkability
once
again
is
high
on
this
with
the
nice
low
abv
and
delicious
factor
worth
trying
for
sure
d
it
goes
down
like
most
sam
adams
brews
quick
easy
its
very
easy
to
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
a
highly
drinkable
dunkelweizen
here
thats
worth
a
try
for
sure
id
drink
it
again
but
probably
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
again
unless
i
was
low
on
cash
d
refreshing
solid
beer
moderately
drinkable
pours
a
dark
cloudy
amberorange
with
a
big
clumpy
offwhite
head
smells
of
cloves
and
other
mild
spices
tastes
of
caramelized
plantains
and
roasted
almonds
good
carbonation
a
mediumlight
body
and
a
dry
finish
quite
a
complex
brew
with
a
lot
going
on
for
the
palate
to
enjoy
still
a
great
drinking
beer
overall
id
have
no
problem
polishing
off
a
sixer
of
these
and
hope
sa
decides
to
sell
it
that
way
in
the
future
d
whatever
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
summer
beer
a
fall
beer
a
spring
beer
just
a
mess
in
all
honesty
im
kind
of
on
the
fence
about
recommending
this
beer
to
other
people
its
definitely
worth
trying
i
wouldnt
turn
down
one
of
these
in
the
future
but
probably
wont
go
buy
a
sixer
of
it
either
d
easy
to
drink
and
not
particularly
offensive
but
this
one
falls
far
short
of
what
i
typically
expect
of
a
good
dunkel
in
every
category
d
very
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
weisse
mood
and
especially
if
you
want
something
darker
and
more
creative
not
your
typical
dunkelweizen
with
generous
banana
and
clove
oddly
we
did
not
pick
up
on
either
of
those
traits
as
it
was
a
bit
mellower
or
restrained
though
still
flavorful
that
said
its
hard
to
pit
this
against
the
bells
and
whistles
of
your
typical
dunkelweizen
d
a
good
example
of
the
style
but
not
stellar
easily
quaffable
and
goes
down
smooth
and
easy
could
drink
a
few
in
a
sitting
d
flavorful
enough
to
not
be
boring
but
good
with
food
because
the
taste
isnt
overpowering
conclusion
really
glad
i
got
to
try
it
but
its
not
something
im
broken
up
about
not
getting
to
try
regularly
pours
an
aged
copper
penny
color
with
thin
off
white
head
but
decent
lacing
smell
and
taste
is
of
freshly
roasted
grains
with
a
touch
of
yeast
bread
dark
fruit
and
spice
medium
body
fully
carbonated
nothing
complex
but
just
a
pretty
good
beer
from
sam
adams
pretty
good
overall
it
goes
down
easy
but
its
not
really
something
i
would
want
to
drink
all
night
i
would
like
to
see
a
little
more
sweetness
in
the
way
of
fruity
flavors
and
a
little
more
carbonation
a
solid
addition
to
the
samuel
adams
line
i
poured
it
into
a
glass
it
was
a
nice
medium
brown
color
with
a
nice
head
then
floats
to
a
nice
thin
lace
have
a
nice
smell
of
malts
and
a
hint
of
fruit
has
a
nice
crisp
malty
fruity
flavor
has
a
little
of
a
heavy
mouth
feel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
i
think
it
is
very
drinkable
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
another
good
one
from
sa
a
solid
dunkelweis
from
sam
adams
not
a
german
version
at
all
but
pretty
damn
good
and
very
drinkable
just
a
solid
american
dunkelweizen
session
beer
i
was
impressed
when
it
was
like
a
german
style
since
i
had
tried
other
american
wheat
beers
pours
red
brown
in
color
with
a
decent
head
taste
is
very
yeasty
with
slight
fruit
notes
maybe
dark
fruits
it
is
very
drinkable
if
it
comes
in
6packs
i
would
buy
it
just
for
a
regular
impressive
wheat
from
sa
a
very
drinkable
beer
especially
in
the
autumn
season
i
dont
think
id
make
a
habit
of
the
style
but
it
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
tastes
very
good
but
not
quite
as
fullflavored
as
id
have
liked
given
the
promising
aromas
bready
flavors
allaround
with
flashes
of
apple
and
white
grape
mouthfeel
is
wellcarbonated
and
a
little
on
the
light
side
which
is
how
i
often
find
sa
beers
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
end
each
sip
overall
a
tasty
beer
that
id
enjoy
drinking
again
d
would
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
dunkelweisse
but
decent
enough
to
have
a
few
of
would
i
buy
more
of
it
hmm
tough
call
as
id
have
to
buy
the
entire
12pack
im
leaning
towards
no
pours
a
dark
copper
body
with
a
rocky
white
head
aromas
of
spicy
yeast
esters
and
toasted
malts
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
tingly
level
of
carbonation
flavors
of
sweet
caramel
and
dried
cherries
theres
a
very
low
bitterness
in
the
finish
pretty
good
drinkability
md
clean
smooth
some
slight
carbonation
great
feel
and
taste
throughout
the
palate
great
beer
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
good
brew
it
has
a
certain
sessionability
to
it
i
recommend
you
try
this
one
this
is
one
beer
sam
adams
ought
to
plug
in
sixpacks
one
of
their
best
new
beers
in
some
time
i
gladly
boasted
about
it
to
a
cashier
the
next
time
i
grabbed
a
12
at
the
store
very
good
and
well
worth
trying
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
could
find
it
in
a
six
pack
this
is
a
nice
stab
at
a
flavourful
style
which
i
quite
like
sam
adams
bbc
would
be
wise
to
put
this
in
six
packs
i
know
i
would
revisit
this
quite
frequently
because
of
the
value
of
sa
brews
definitely
recommended
drinkability
this
dunkel
is
quite
drinkable
in
my
book
i
got
it
in
a
harvest
beers
multipack
but
havent
seen
it
around
here
in
sixers
i
think
i
would
buy
it
every
so
often
if
it
were
so
available
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
is
somewhat
lacking
in
flavor
its
pretty
good
but
not
as
rich
and
complex
as
i
would
like
like
i
said
before
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
very
cidery
for
some
reason
samuel
adams
dunkelweizen
is
a
cloudy
tawny
beer
with
a
thin
dense
off
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
and
lacing
it
smells
spicy
and
a
little
sweet
with
notes
of
clove
pear
and
raisins
its
medium
bodied
with
a
metallic
feel
the
finish
is
quick
and
a
bit
gritty
it
has
a
mellow
flavor
of
banana
and
pear
with
a
light
grassy
bitterness
it
seems
like
it
will
get
sweet
but
it
doesnt
the
aftertaste
is
musky
its
not
bad
good
mouthfeel
a
touch
grainy
maybe
but
good
drinkability
really
smooth
medium
in
body
no
bubbles
on
the
back
of
the
throat
if
it
wasnt
for
the
taste
i
would
think
i
was
drinking
water
d
not
a
bad
dunkel
its
appearance
and
nose
dont
represent
the
rest
of
the
beer
well
though
after
that
it
tapers
off
a
bit
making
it
less
drinkable
but
i
still
wouldnt
turn
it
down
not
bad
just
a
fair
dunkelweizen
a
creamy
light
khaki
head
sits
comfortably
on
a
leathery
tan
colored
body
the
bready
malty
aroma
is
loaded
with
cloves
and
bananas
medium
in
body
a
sweet
malty
front
leads
to
an
abundance
of
spicy
yeast
banana
fruitiness
some
clove
brown
sugar
and
a
hint
of
molasses
are
there
also
in
the
flavor
the
finish
sees
a
return
to
that
dominating
banana
flavor
pretty
solid
for
a
dunkelweizen
i
enjoyed
this
in
the
sa
harvest
collection
but
i
dont
know
if
id
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
this
up
if
it
were
available
in
six
packs
pours
a
clear
medium
brownish
amber
with
a
creamy
tan
head
aroma
is
big
on
artificial
banana
with
lesser
notes
of
clove
and
vanilla
flavor
is
also
overbearing
with
the
pure
banana
oil
and
clove
with
no
room
for
bready
malt
to
even
it
out
finish
is
a
bit
weak
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
supple
similar
to
the
authentic
german
versions
some
good
qualities
some
bad
overall
a
decent
beer
at
best
dryness
on
the
palate
but
with
a
maltiness
could
be
a
little
less
attenuated
to
bring
the
beer
around
which
also
effects
drinkability
this
beer
pours
a
cloudy
amberbrown
color
the
head
is
two
inches
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
lacing
that
lasts
until
the
beer
is
gone
the
aroma
is
of
banana
toffee
malt
and
a
hint
of
chocolate
while
there
is
some
banana
present
in
the
aroma
it
isnt
as
strong
as
most
german
examples
it
is
almost
as
though
they
used
a
neutral
american
yeast
strain
instead
of
a
german
weizen
yeast
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
again
id
like
to
see
more
banana
bread
flavors
and
some
clove
too
the
malt
flavors
that
are
present
are
nice
though
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
but
lacks
the
chewy
texture
that
i
expect
in
a
weizen
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
and
not
a
dunkelweizen
i
would
pick
up
again
if
i
had
more
than
one
option
cheers
m
mediumbody
with
noticeable
texture
notes
a
nice
beer
from
sam
adams
i
think
they
would
be
smart
to
sell
this
in
six
packs
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
it
is
very
crisp
and
clean
but
the
beer
retains
some
good
weight
which
fills
you
up
it
has
a
very
light
carbonation
and
is
easy
to
enjoy
for
me
hefeweizens
are
not
a
very
drinkable
style
but
this
dunkelweizen
is
perfectly
fine
in
the
relative
drinkability
department
i
finished
mine
quite
quickly
and
would
have
another
the
taste
is
a
bit
watery
was
expecting
more
flavorful
malts
very
little
sweetness
the
yeast
does
its
thing
but
the
overall
impression
is
that
of
a
dunkelweizen
light
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
in
fact
is
one
of
the
better
sa
beers
but
it
does
not
come
close
to
the
likes
of
julius
echter
or
weihenstephaner
i
would
like
to
see
this
in
6packs
by
itself
and
would
be
worth
a
purchase
every
now
and
then
in
the
usual
sa
price
range
for
bavarian
wheat
beer
fans
such
as
myself
the
malt
and
fruitiness
of
this
beer
are
superbly
balanced
and
the
sensation
of
drinking
it
is
a
real
treat
simultaneously
it
glides
down
and
settles
gently
in
the
gut
making
it
easy
to
declare
this
an
extremely
drinkable
brew
both
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
get
me
another
the
body
is
exceptionally
crisp
not
smooth
enough
for
a
weizen
o
reminds
me
a
lot
of
german
represenatations
of
the
style
in
a
good
way
this
is
definitely
not
a
weak
representation
and
is
pretty
true
to
the
style
would
have
this
again
i
hope
they
put
this
out
in
its
own
six
pack
eventually
overall
a
nice
dunkelweizen
i
bought
the
harvest
collection
cause
this
beer
was
in
it
and
im
thinking
it
wasnt
worth
it
but
its
the
only
way
ive
seen
it
d
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
its
an
enjoyable
although
lowimpact
brew
nice
if
you
like
a
more
sour
wheat
bite
to
your
dunkel
medium
bodied
with
a
bit
of
a
syrupy
feel
not
filling
at
all
though
nothing
stellar
here
but
a
good
drinker
drinkability
is
good
this
beer
has
some
very
good
tastes
and
goes
down
very
smooth
dunkelweizens
are
a
tough
beer
to
make
great
but
sam
adams
does
a
very
good
job
with
their
offering
pours
a
murky
brown
with
a
medium
sized
head
smell
is
spicy
wheat
with
a
bit
of
caramel
also
a
white
wine
note
taste
has
a
very
mild
sweetness
a
roasted
grainy
flavor
a
bit
of
spicy
wheat
herbal
flavor
in
the
finish
maybe
a
touch
watery
overall
a
decent
dunkel
for
an
american
version
very
nice
foggy
brown
appearance
w
slight
amber
hues
burnt
toast
biscuits
and
nutmeg
on
the
nose
the
taste
is
complex
and
you
taste
the
dark
malts
up
front
caramel
and
malted
wheat
adds
a
nice
cereal
note
some
hints
of
fruits
and
banana
shows
up
in
the
middle
crisp
finish
medium
bodied
well
done
pours
a
very
nice
coppermud
color
unfiltered
with
a
tiny
bit
of
head
but
no
lacing
nice
scent
some
nice
dark
grains
with
a
nice
sweet
wheat
malt
aroma
and
a
hint
of
pepperspice
good
taste
deep
and
rich
a
nice
dark
wheat
with
a
strong
pepper
aftertaste
from
the
noble
hops
goes
down
fine
if
a
little
too
thick
medium
bodied
with
mediumfull
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
nice
and
crisp
in
flavor
which
seems
to
be
an
american
touch
but
i
think
this
style
should
comes
across
as
creamier
on
the
palate
overall
i
do
like
this
beer
and
it
is
real
easy
to
drink
this
one
down
maybe
too
easy
rb
notes
looks
good
smells
good
tastes
good
but
something
is
kind
of
missing
it
lacks
punch
or
distinction
fades
into
mediocrity
drinkability
very
drinkable
not
a
bad
beer
appears
too
clear
for
an
unfiltered
weizen
perhaps
a
draw
back
from
having
it
from
a
bottle
i
drank
the
one
beer
but
that
would
be
my
limit
on
this
one
the
clear
winner
of
the
beers
in
the
fall
sampler
i
really
enjoyed
the
dunkelweizen
tasty
blend
of
flavors
and
a
little
more
heft
than
many
hefeweizens
good
stuff
a
refreshing
drink
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
d
its
a
great
balanced
beer
and
to
be
honest
i
would
have
no
clue
it
was
american
in
a
blind
taste
test
standout
beer
by
samuel
adams
pours
very
hazy
almost
muddy
looking
amber
like
a
good
quality
unfiltered
apple
juice
little
head
and
what
there
is
fades
to
a
thin
swirl
smells
breadlike
with
some
hints
of
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
a
trifle
sweeter
with
a
good
deal
more
banana
a
bit
more
clove
and
a
touch
of
lemon
in
addition
to
the
lighter
breadiness
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
but
quite
tasty
clean
and
smooth
in
the
mouth
this
is
a
fairly
light
dunkleweiss
but
really
quite
nice
drinkability
nice
craft
beer
from
sa
worth
a
try
just
didnt
like
the
fact
i
had
to
buy
a
case
to
get
to
it
not
too
crazy
about
green
apple
touch
though
it
is
slight
quite
wheaty
drinks
well
enough
though
dont
know
that
i
would
want
to
keep
drinking
it
solid
though
would
take
a
some
classic
german
examples
of
style
over
this
one
d
pretty
decent
not
bad
but
not
great
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
sam
adams
a
very
middle
of
the
road
for
any
style
ill
drink
it
again
if
offered
in
a
heartbeat
but
i
dunno
if
i
would
buy
it
again
myself
rthe
reason
i
would
buy
it
is
to
introduce
to
someone
else
drinkability
pretty
good
i
would
drink
it
again
the
most
exciting
new
release
from
sam
adams
in
at
least
a
few
years
compared
to
their
hefeweizen
this
is
a
benchmark
accomplishment
i
squeezed
the
two
bottles
from
the
fall
harvest
sampler
pack
to
find
one
of
the
most
inviting
looking
dunkelweizens
ive
seen
in
awhile
big
amber
brown
clouded
body
with
a
billowing
cream
tarnished
head
that
rises
above
the
rim
of
my
12
liter
ayinger
weissbier
glass
lacing
is
even
and
fine
with
intricate
detail
beautiful
looking
brew
aromatics
come
with
a
touch
of
raisin
and
tart
sliced
green
apples
a
bit
of
clove
banana
and
bubblegum
as
well
even
some
mango
juicy
characteristics
arise
with
further
sniffs
a
touch
of
herbal
hops
in
the
nose
with
a
nice
roasted
malt
edge
on
the
biscuit
and
wheat
malt
profile
flavor
is
perfect
none
of
that
traditional
sam
adams
house
yeast
this
one
is
authentic
german
weissbier
yeast
brings
out
all
of
those
great
phenols
juicy
sweetness
with
roasted
malt
edge
brings
to
mind
brown
sugar
sprinkled
banana
bread
with
sliced
green
apple
tartness
and
mango
fructose
complexity
herbal
hops
for
balance
with
big
yeast
characteristics
finishing
sharply
wheaty
with
drying
yeast
components
mouthfeel
is
perfect
with
effervescence
in
the
carbonation
and
medium
to
lighter
bodied
nothing
cloying
or
heavy
on
the
palate
perfect
version
of
the
style
drinkability
is
crazy
a
beer
they
will
be
successful
with
if
released
in
six
packs
on
its
own
every
once
and
in
awhile
the
samuel
adams
brewmasters
collection
hits
a
homerun
im
glad
i
was
here
to
experience
it
m
d
not
the
smoothest
beer
in
the
world
but
still
very
drinkable
and
a
pretty
good
carbonation
level
that
adds
a
nice
kick
d
pleasantly
subdued
aroma
and
taste
very
refreshing
purchased
as
part
of
the
seasonal
12
pack
this
year
12oz
bottle
i
had
this
years
and
years
ago
probably
15
years
ago
and
remember
enjoying
it
but
never
being
able
to
find
it
the
website
has
all
the
other
brewmaster
collection
brews
but
not
this
one
hrmmm
pours
out
to
a
cloudy
dark
amber
forming
a
tall
offyellow
whipped
head
with
excellent
retention
and
awesome
lacing
carbonation
is
moderatebrisk
the
aroma
is
very
nice
lots
of
old
brown
bananas
cloves
a
nice
toasted
malt
base
phenols
some
spicy
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
tang
the
taste
is
as
a
good
dunkel
weizen
should
be
cloves
and
bananas
with
dark
malts
popping
through
but
it
doesnt
quite
get
to
the
fresh
banana
bread
ideal
in
this
case
there
is
some
burnt
rubber
in
there
as
well
something
that
either
my
taste
buds
have
gotten
more
sensitive
to
over
the
last
3
years
or
some
mutation
that
has
been
going
on
with
a
prominent
manufactured
yeast
strain
at
any
rate
its
nice
to
see
it
back
but
honestly
with
michelob
dunkel
weizen
being
available
for
6
996er
and
the
fact
that
it
is
one
of
my
very
favorite
dunkel
weizens
ever
ill
stick
with
that
when
i
need
a
dw
kick
d
overall
this
is
a
good
dunkel
it
was
actually
better
than
i
expected
flavors
and
aroma
are
a
little
subdued
but
still
a
solid
offering
md
easily
drinkable
no
drawbacks
in
mouthfeel
or
drinkability
nothing
stands
out
though
tastes
good
and
feels
smooth
and
does
not
seem
to
be
over
5
5
abv
or
so
very
easy
to
drink
id
buy
a
sixer
of
this
over
a
lot
of
sas
beers
and
its
easily
the
best
thing
in
the
harvest
pack
even
if
the
mediocre
appearance
is
going
to
knock
the
score
down
a
bit
its
hard
to
get
a
fresh
dunkel
often
this
isnt
the
truest
one
in
the
world
but
its
a
good
beer
d
i
was
really
suprised
by
this
beer
alot
of
sam
adams
are
hit
or
miss
but
this
one
is
actually
very
good
good
flavor
and
sessionable
abv
makes
for
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
having
several
of
dgood
and
enjoyable
nearly
sessionable
d
i
was
quite
impressed
with
this
dunkel
drinking
it
made
me
wish
that
it
was
available
outside
of
the
harvest
pack
not
that
the
pack
is
a
bad
deal
but
itd
be
nice
to
be
able
to
buy
this
on
its
own
in
a
sixer
id
definitely
have
it
again
d
a
nice
dunkel
overall
a
better
appearance
would
be
nice
but
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
very
nice
notched

easily
drinkable
how
sad
this
only
comes
in
a
variety
pack
they
will
do
a
six
pack
of
cherry
wheat
but
god
forbid
they
do
a
six
pack
of
this
perhaps
they
are
gauging
peoples
reactions
to
this
since
it
is
newly
released
lets
hope
so
pours

somewhat
understated

taste
mirrors
smell
with
slightly
understated
qualities
mouthfeel
is
smooth
slightly
creamy
nice
on
the
palate
this
lends
itself
to
a
very
drinkable
product
the
carbonation
was
nice
and
spicy
and
the
body
was
more
medium
to
full
with
a
hearty
character
the
drinkability
was
there
and
was
only
harmed
by
my
impression
of
the
aroma
and
flavor
i
would
buy
this
often
if
it
was
in
6ers
it
really
is
the
only
reason
i
bought
the
autumn
pack
that
said
ill
probably
buy
another
or
two
while
theyre
available
this
a
pretty
damn
good
example
on
the
style
very
drinkable
easily
drinkable
a
decent
interpretation
of
the
style
though
a
bit
lacking
in
the
richer
character
of
traditional
examples
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
character
and
perhaps
a
little
more
fermentation
character
in
the
nose
much
better
than
the
sam
adams
hefeweizen
as
this
one
can
truly
be
called
a
dunkelweizen
without
hesitation
definitely
one
that
boston
beer
should
put
into
more
regular
circulation

on
this
guy
for
sure
definitely
not
what
i
was
looking
for
this
beer
has
a
great
and
strong
weiss
beer
aroma
every
characteristic
of
a
weiss
is
in
it
there
is
a
lot
banana
and
peppery
clove
there
was
only
about
a
finger
and
a
half
of
fizzy
off
white
head
with
no
retain
ability
it
has
ruddy
brown
body
that
i
was
not
overly
fond
of
it
was
just
a
bit
odd
the
flavor
starts
off
great
and
it
has
a
fresh
flavor
but
you
cant
use
this
beer
as
a
sipper
it
gets
a
plastic
like
taste
as
it
sits
for
the
most
part
it
once
again
has
great
weiss
profile
clove
pepper
and
a
bit
of
tropical
fruit
it
was
very
fizzy
and
a
bit
thin
in
the
mouthfeel
while
i
first
sampled
this
beer
in
germany
nearly
15
years
ago
im
thrilled
that
its
recently
become
available
in
the
u
s
ive
also
noted
that
several
reviewers
have
this
beer
confused
with
unertl
muhldorf
which
is
a
completely
separate
brewery
and
product
pours
dark
brown
like
a
dunkrlweizen
had
to
recheck
bottle
label
to
be
sure
right
one
light
nose
with
banana
clove
good
amount
of
banana
on
the
palate
with
toasted
wheat
cracker
yeasty
action
in
there
too
hard
to
get
past
the
atypical
appearance
d
this
is
a
great
easy
to
drink
beer
for
any
time
of
the
year
or
day
would
be
a
great
way
to
introduce
new
drinkers
to
a
variety
drinkability
is
ok
not
that
remarkable
a
beer
d
pretty
easy
lots
of
flavor
for
the
abv
o
very
good
beer
particularly
good
fresh

d
not
my
favorite
but
never
a
bad
decision
is
this
the
best
hefe
ive
had
nope
but
its
a
damn
fine
brew
bottle
as
an
extra
pours
really
dark
much
darker
than
i
expected
for
a
hefe
plenty
of
citrus
and
wheat
in
the
nose
like
i
expect
but
the
palate
not
really
what
i
wanted
more
full
bodied
and
syrupy
its
like
a
hefe
extract
if
there
was
one
i
could
only
drink
a
sample
of
this
not
the
whole
thing
its
ok
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
overall
the
beer
did
not
seem
to
be
very
typical
hefe
the
more
i
drank
it
the
more
i
enjoyed
it
it
is
definitely
worth
trying
taste
is
nice
not
as
sweet
as
some
other
hefeweizens
but
a
little
spicier
and
more
yeasty
nice
bready
flavor
and
medium
mouthfeel
not
as
creamy
as
i
would
have
liked
though
refreshing
but
not
the
best
hefe
ive
had
to
compare
the
unertl
is
similar
to
schneiderweisse
in
terms
of
a
style
within
the
hefeweizen
family
but
not
quite
as
good
unertl
was
disappointing
all
was
well
until
the
aroma
test
its
was
hard
to
get
past
the
big
stick
of
butter
that
fell
in
my
bier
the
body
was
watery
and
the
flavor
was
empty
ill
stop
here
and
retest
another
time
taste
is
smoky
reminds
me
of
some
sausages
and
has
a
nice
husky
malt
taste
the
wheat
give
the
beer
a
nice
grainy
taste
the
obvious
ripe
banana
and
clove
are
also
present
with
the
clove
being
quite
strong
the
body
is
thin
and
make
my
mouth
dry
it
feels
adstringent
on
the
tongue
d
one
of
the
more
subdued
hefes
ive
had
despite
that
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
that
keeps
tingling
the
tongue
long
after
the
mouthfull
has

and
brown
yeast
soon
after
adding
it
gets
even
darker
remembering
more
of
a
dark
weizen
nose
shows
lots
of
bannana
esters
good
chocolate
and
carramellic
sweatnes
only
litle
off
is
the
yeasty
smell
thats
also
over
it
but
not
disturbing
that
much
taste
is
lots
of
wheatmalts
darkmalt
mostly
in
form
of
carramalts
full
taste
and
hardly
any
sourness
and
a
light
bitter
aftertaste
that
again
also
shows
litle
yeast
greatly
carbonated
and
fresh
and
tasty
overall
impression
easy
but
very
enjoyable
when
drinkable
and
imo
well
worth
a
try
quite
peculiar
highly
recommended
from
a
german
who
called
weissbiers
her
milk
pours
much
darker
then
other
weissbiers
and
very
hazy
as
well
smell
is
like
a
traditional
mixed
with
caramel
this
caramel
takes
precedent
over
most
of
the
other
flavors
in
the
taste
too
only
a
little
of
the
citrus
and
wheat
this
makes
it
very
sweet
and
allmouth
encompassing
really
pleasant
to
drink
at
first
glance
you
would
think
that
this
was
a
dunkel
dark
beer
but
the
brewer
plainly
labels
it
weissbier

its
slight
caramel
color
is
appealing
as
is
its
head
that
seems
to
last
for
days
the
initial
taste
is
of
banana
and
clove
as
expected
from
a
german
wheat
beer
the
beer
leaves
a
lasting
impression
of
juicy
apple
with
a
touch
of
toffee
overall
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
german
hefeweiss
and
a
great
thirst
quencher
plenty
of
character
here
can
easily
lead
to
excess
and
maybe
its
just
because
im
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkelweizen
at
the
moment
but
this
one
seems
quite
a
bit
underrated
feel
light
body
exceptionally
smooth
and
creamy
for
a
light
bodied
beer
on
tap
at
the
wonderful
helgas
the
best
german
food
around
poured
into
a
proper
1
liter
glass
i
could
barely
lift
this
hazy
amber
brew
with
one
hand
classic
banana
clove
yeast
complexion
on
the
nose
with
the
darker
wheat
malt
sweet
and
red
not
quite
roasty
and
dark
like
the
midnight
stuff
its
classically
german
the
taste
confirms
what
the
nose
hinted
at
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
ver
had
as
good
as
the
weihenstephaner
stuff
for
sure
and
they
have
to
be
the
standard
by
which
these
beers
are
measured
the
yeast
is
great
delicate
but
heavy
on
the
banana
and
all
the
carbonation
makes
the
darkness
of
the
wheat
almost
hard
to
pick
up
on
but
there
is
a
mellow
caramel
sweetness
running
through
it
from
the
grain
which
i
really
like
its
so
refreshing
and
i
had
no
problem
drinking
a
liter
before
it
warmed
up
much
i
wish
this
was
around
on
shelves
although
i
have
a
feeling
the
draft
drinks
a
loot
nicer
than
some
older
bottles
might
but
id
like
to
see
it
nevertheless
a
perfect
pairing
for
anything
on
the
menu
down
at
helgas
which
is
a
must
if
youve
never
been
awesome
beer
just
a
beauty
picked
this
up
at
a
great
beer

in

the

of
my
favorite
interpretations
of
the

flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
spice
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
solid
caramel
and
banana
presence
all
around
o
a
dunkelweizen
that
is
kind
of
mild
but
yet
still
quite
complex
appearance
is
a
cloudy
brown
with
more
apparent
unfiltered
yeast
than
franziskaner

the
smell
is
overwhelmingly
caramel
with
some
banana

taste
is
very
smooth
with
predominant
flavors
of

this
is
one
of

and
i
would
routinely
keep
kegs
of
this
dunkelweiss

small
amount
of
sediment
at

the
bottle
but
i
swished
it
german
style
and
poured
into
the
glass
a
good
example
of
true
bavarian
weizen
this
beer
drank
extremely
well
poured
a
great
aromatic
head
and
was
incredibly
balanced
it
has
a
very
appealing
nutty
fresh
baked
bread
nose
to
it
it
went
dont
way
too
easy
and
i
was
quickly
saddened
once
it
sank
in
that
this
was
a
onetime
beer
for
me
i
hope
that
it
eventually
either
gets
imported
or
if
that
is
already
in
place
makes
it
way
down
south
medium
bodied
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
the
beer
is
very
well
balanced
and
simply
tastes
great
i
gave
my
girlfriend
a
sip
who
normally
is
hesitant
to
try
anything
to
do
with
germany
and
she
loved
it
if
you
have
the
chance
try
this
beer
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
in
short
a
rather
bland
representative
of
the
style
although
a
selfproclaimed
king
könig
nothing
is
royal
in
this
one
d
easy
to
quaff
and
reasonable
dark
wheat
beer
i
can
drink
this
overall
looks
good
and
feels
alright
but
everything
else
was
at
least
disappointing
and
maybe
even
a
little
off
not
all
that
enjoyable
which
made
it
not
very
drinkable
either
there
are
definitely
much
better
examples
out
there
pass
having
had
this
directly
after
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
the
former
was
much
better
in
my
opinion
i
did
not
find
the
ayinger
to
have
the
balanced
dark
wheat
presence
like
the
weinhenstephaner
did

from

tough
to
find
a
better
german
beer
from
any
other
brewer
overall
pretty
good
dunkleweizen
but
not
something
im
completely
in
love
with
it
hits
on
all
the
characteristics
youd
expect
from
a
dunkleweizen
but
its
a
just
a
bit
too
sweet
for
me
to
love
it
definitely
would
try
this
again
but
having
a
better
balance
from
the
hops
to
cut
down
on
the
sweetness
would
bump
this
up
a
notch
for
me

medium

and

something
about
a
great

in
the
winter
seems
so
transgressive
and
perfect
overall
leave
it
up
to
the
germans
to
make
a
solid
dunkelweizen
they
seem
to
do
it
the
best
another
solid
brew
from
this
brewery
spicy

medhigh

i
had
this
side
by
side
with
weihenstephaner
hefeweissbier
dunkel
and
preferred
the
ayinger
which
is
saying
a
lot
a
top
representation
of
the
style
for
sure
o
supremely
drinkable
and
packed
with
flavor
one
of
my
favorite
wheat
beers
for
sure
pours
a
pretty
dark
amber
in
color
with
a
good
2finger
foamy
white
head
that
stays
around
for
a
while
before
settling
down
to
a
2mm
head
some
sediment
is
seen
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
some
spotty
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
rings
as
first
that
settle
back
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
pleasant
and
is
of
fresh
wheat
bananas
and
honey
the
taste
is
even
better
with
some
caramel
in
the
mix
as
well
very
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitterness
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
medium
bodied
and
perfect
carbonation
a
great
german
brew
absolutely
delicious
found
it
at
a
fred
meyer
in
beaverton
not
my
first
dunkelweizen
by
my
first
authentically
german
one
poured
a
deep
amberlight
brown
smelled
of
banana
and
cloves
tasted
almost
like
banana
bread
i
regret
having
only
bought
one
highly
recommended
what
a
great
beer
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
very
tasty
weizen
the
aroma
look
and
taste
are
quite
fantastic
with
the
only
thing
keeping
this
from
the
supreme
top
being
the
feel
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
you
certainly
can
count
on
to
being
rather
pleasant
overall
probably
would
get
a
perfect
score
if
i
had
this
fresh
too
many
weird
flavors
from
being
an
export
delicious
dunkel
o
a
really
good
weizen
great
for
the
weizen
style
but
i
expected
something
a
bit
darker
being
a
dunkel
not
upset
by
any
means
though
another
brilliant
brew
by
the
folks
at
ayinger
a
stellar
companion
for
a
hot
summer
day
that
is
packed
full
of
character
a
must
have
for
any
beer
fan
a
nice
hefe
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
worth
the
price
overall
im
not
sure
if
i
like
this
more
than
the
weihenstephaner
dunkel
but
its
close
id
love
to
do
a
side
by
side
and
id
enjoy
doing
it
us
americans
have
the
one
up
on
europe
so
far
as
most
ales
are
concerned
but
weve
yet
to
touch
on
the
efforts
of
our
eastern
comrades
when
it
comes
to
hefes
and
dunkels
theres
been
some
commendable
attempts
sierras
kellerwies
comes
to
mind
but
were
not
there
yet
this
dunkel
is
proof
weve
got
a
hell
of
a
way
to
go
o
not
a
lot
of
flavor
or
aroma
in
this
beer
no
grain
flavor
very
light
on
esters
and
phenols
faint
hops
its
an
imported
bottle
no
bottle
date
and
no
import
date
wont
buy
it
again
unless
i
can
try
it

so
probably
not
a

overall
im
slowly
warming

this

definitely
a
great
one
nice

taste

not

at

is

can
definitely
taste

reminds

if
champagne
almost
like
a

very
nice
refreshing
beer
we
get
used
to
paying
these
ridiculous

for

beers
heres
an
excellent
classic
for
four
bucks
for
the
500
ml
bottle
purchased
at
bine
vine
in
san
diego
overall
much
brighter
for
a
dark
weizen
then
i
expected
this
brew
was
filled
with
bubbly
fruits
and
medium
bodied
breast
malt
tones
slow
sipper
due
to
the
big
carbonation
factor
o
its
a
wellcontructed
beer
which
is
found
slightly
wanting
for
malt
wheat
and
spice
on
the
nose
and
tongue
id
be
really
interested
to
try
this
fresh
on
tap
i
suspect
it
might
be
a
whole
different
ball
game
o
yummy
stuff
love
ayinger
beers
they
never
disappoint
popped
open
a
5l
bottle
for
dessert
this
is
lighter
colored
than
a
dunkel
but
more
of
an
amber
than
your
common
hefe
off
the
bat
its
sort
of
like
schneider
weisse
for
the
darker
bread
notes
overall
it
does
follow
more
of
the
notes
of
a
hefeweizen
with
mild
clove
vanilla
and
a
hint
of
banana
its
toasty
and
bready
but
also
has
occasional
dark
crispy
wheat
notes
its
smooth
and
deep
worth
trying
with
and
without
the
yeast
dumped
inits
a
little
brighter
before
man
im
wishing
i
didnt
only
buy
one
bottle
get
yourself
some
this
brew
is
medium
bodied
and
smoooth
it
goes
down
nice
and
refreshing
with
no
residue
left
behind
i
paid
only
about
3
50
for
the
bottle
which
i
consider
a
bargain
based
on
its
overall
quality
o
very
nice
dunkelweizen
tastes
like
a
slightly
heavier
and
breadier
hefe
which
im
guessing
is
probably
exactly
what
it
is
very
easy
drinking
nice
and
smooth
goes
down
slowly
but
easily
beautiful
maybe
a
bit
farther
than
a

discoverd
this

the

of
a

i
must

the
balance
really
works

almost
prefer
this
style
to
a

color

a

are
all
about
the

this
is
probably
the
best
damn
hefeweizenbier
ive
ever
tasted
a
light
bodied
beer
with
high
carbonation
has
the
illusion
of
being
a
hearty
brew
while
retaining
an
exceptional
drinkability
the
hop
character
is
subdued
and
seems
to
be
slightly
spicy
and
floral
probably
hallertau
or
a
derivative
while
its
contribution
to
the
flavor
is
minute
the
spiciness
created
by
the
yeast
balances
the
mild
residual
sweetness
the
richness
of
the
malt
and
complex
bouquet
of
aromas
and
flavor
seems
to
contradict
the
ease
with
which
one
can
drink
this
beer
this
was
extremely

would

so
much

that

style
well
overall
this
was
still
a
quenching
quaffable
example
of
the
style
still
it
fell
into
a
class
below
my
benchmark
for
the
type
the
dunkelweizen
by

smooth
and
creamy
to
start
with
a

refreshingly
different
i
will
have
this
again
only
a
negligible
amount
too
much
in
the
way
of
carbonation
but
not
enough
to
discourage
me
other
than
the
carbonation
this
goes
down
fairly
smoothly
overall
another
great
beer
from
ayinger
when
poured
there
is
a
big
white
head
that
drops
out
fast
leaveing
a
glass
filled
with
a
cloudy
dark
amber
beer
there
is
a
light
malt
sweetness
in
with
a
great
spicey
aroma
that
is
rounded
out
with
a
hint
of
clove
the
taste
was
an
excellent
balance
of
citrusy
sweetness
along
with
the
well
pronounced
classic
banana
and
clove
notes
this
was
a
tasty
treat
for
me
which
a
savored
slowly
pleasantly
sweet
delivers
everything
promised

cloves

quite

easy
drinker
taste
is
very
similiar
to
the
smell
fruity
wheat
malt
and
banana
cloves
pepper
and
add
to
that
a
light
smokiness
also
light
caramel
mouth
is
a
bit
thin
but
has
some
sticky
maltiness
and
lingers
on
the
tongue
smooth
and
silky
really
drinkable
i
havent
had
a
dunkel
weisse
for
years
since
germany
but
this
one
would
have
to
rank
up
there
as
a
whole
this
is
a
good
beer
which
i
would
drink
again
but
was
definitely
expecting
more
in
terms
of
flavours
based
on
the
smells
in
its
defence
it
would
pair
very
well
with
a
good
brie
triple
crème
and
a
baguette
pours
a
hazy
amber
color
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
the
head
settles
and
leaves
behind
a
nice
lace
fruity
aroma
with
banana
and
citrus
upfront
scents
of
wheat
bread
and
spicy
clove
lie
in
the
backround
flavor
begins
fruity
with
banana
and
tart
apple
the
malt
then
says
its
part
with
soft
wheat
and
light
caramel
notes
spicy
cloves
balance
and
round
out
the
beer
medium
bodied
crisp
and
smooth
highly
quaffable
and
not
as
sticky
on
the
tounge
as
other
hefes
very
nice
dunkel
2
29
for
a
5l
ayinger
urweisse
was
a
gold
amber
color
with
a
big
long
lasting
head
there
were
bits
of
sediment
floating
around
amongst
the
bubbles
the
aroma
was
clovey
and
floral
the
taste
was
medicinal
with
elements
of
cloves
hay
citrus
and
caramel
it
had
good
carbonation
some
sweetness
and
was
smooth
and
fruity
overall
the
finish
was
slightly
dry
and
spicey
as
well
as
a
little
yeasty
a
pretty
good
beer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
i
se
every
time
i
go
to
the
store
and
think
next
time
glad
i
finally
picked
it
up
17
oz
bottle
pours
a
hazy
brownish
gold
with
an
enormous
ivory
head
that
eventually
relaxes
into
long
lasting
patchy
lace
no
sediment
in
the
glass
but
i
left
a
cc
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
nice
aroma
with
lemon
grapefruit
and
banana
up
front
spicy
cloves
are
also
very
noticeable
anise
is
my
first
impression
in
the
mouthfeel
but
theres
a
lot
of
fizzy
carbonation
here
taste
is
complex
with
tart
lemon
yeast
cloves
in
the
beginning
as
it
warms
toward
room
temperature
the
carbonation
softens
and
sweet
maltiness
and
mcintosh
apples
appear
out
of
nowhere
finishes
neutral
perhaps
a
bit
sweet
malt
with
no
significant
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
charming
and
tasty
brew
from
one
of
my
favorite
german
breweries
definitely
an
unusual
weissbier
that
i
highly
recommend
pours
out
hazy
golden
not
quite
what
i
would
call
dark
there
is
a
massive
offwhite
head
not
much
of
an
aroma
here
some
grainy
maltiness
detected
and
some
very
slight
fruitiness
but
thats
about
it
the
taste
is
a
different
story
a
good
hefty
dose
for
a
hefe
of
slightly
sweet
malt
starts
things
off
then
the
cloves
kick
in
big
time
lingering
on
into
the
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thick
whith
a
sort
of
fullness
and
good
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
except
for
the
fact
that
i
just
dont
enjoy
the
sticky
clove
aftertaste
of
hefes
always
detracts
from
the
drinkability
other
than
that
good
brew
sinkability

i
cant
believe
that
this
was
made
in

this
is
by

the
best
tasting
one
ive
had

seriously
the

this
one
disapears
about
as
soon
as
its
off
the
palate
leaving
hints
again
of
banana
sweetness
but
little
yeast
i
personally
wouldnt
normally
have
a
handful
of
weizens
in
a
row
but
if
i
were
forced
oh
no
this
would
probably
be
my
choice
notes
nine
thumbs
up
taste
is
soft
and
mellow
of
banana
and
frothy
malts
touch
of
lemon
and
clove
sweetness
is
light
citrus
is
flighty
with
a
light
but
favorable
carbonation
with
a
mellow
nearly
creamy
medium
body
with
a
little
touch
of
hop
and
dryness
with
clove
hints
in
the
finish
the
yeast
is
showcased
in
this
beer
quite
a
bit
especailly
in
the
smell
but
with
that
aside
its
one
fine
easy
drinkin
dunkel
overall
impression
drinkability
is
good
id
take
another
the
yeast
is
a
strong
part
of
this
beer
if
you
arent
into
the
weihenstephan
flavor
banana
like
you
probably
wont
enjoy
this
one
on
the
other
hand
if
you
do
this
is
a
fruity
lively
beer
that
should
be
experienced
this
is
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
a
dunkel
weizen
a
very
nicely
made
beer
and
one
i
would
drink
again
for
sure
this
beer
poured
a
orangelight
brown
color
with
yellow
highlights
slightly
haze
to
semi
clear
and
well
carbonated
it
produced
an
off
white
head
that
was
fairly
dense
and
creamy
some
lace
present
but
overpowering
the
aromas
that
came
from
the
glass
were
soft
subtle
and
pleasant
i
nosed
fruit
bananas
green
apples
spices
clove
light
sweet
malt
and
some
hops
again
all
aromas
were
soft
the
flavors
were
of
wheat
grains
spices
clove
fruit
banana
light
hop
some
slight
citrus
soft
bark
yeast
alcohol
and
some
sweet
malt
the
aftertaste
was
light
and
wheaty
flavors
seemed
to
be
more
pronounced
then
the
nose
as
far
as
distinction
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
beer
light
bodied
carbonation
has
some
bite
to
it
but
other
then
that
it
is
a
soft
and
well
balanced
beer
good
representative
of
its
style
and
a
good
summer
time
beer
flavor
is
spicy
and
clovey
with
tons
of
wheat
sweetness
moderate
banana
and
light
bubblegum
flavor
with
a
huge
phenolic
feel
when
you
breathe
through
your
nose
light
spiciness
and
a
semidry
finish
with
just
a
tiny
dash
of
hops
body
is
fairly
full
with
all
the
yeast
floating
around
moderate
carbonation
an
excellent
beer
i
could
probably
drink
this
for
the

of

me
slightly
more

many
others

it

on

watery
side
i
did
not
notice
any
bitterness
or
aftertaste
with
this
brew
however
i
was
disappointed
with
this
brew
as
i
expected
it
to
be
better

it
is

i
like
this
as
well
as
weihenstephaner
good
citrus
taste

is
more
malty

i
love
this
beer
one
of
the
best
weisens
you
can
get
it
poured
a
hazy
dark
golden
amber
color
not
the
dark
color
im
used
to
when
dunkel
is
mentioned
with
a
very
light
tan
head
and
not
much
lace
for
a
weisse
beer
the
aroma
of
yeast
and
spices
and
bananas
filled
the
nose
and
the
taste
was
of
tangy
flavor
of
spicies
and
yeast
with
some
wheat
flavor
and
banana
a
nice
refreshing
urweisse
this
beer
forces
you
to
slow
down
its
a
great
sipping
beer
my
notes
say
marvelous
spicy
raspy
yeasty
and
creamy
thats
not
a
bad
summary
a
good
beer
to
introduce
you
to
the
dunkel
weiss
world
its
a
world
that
i
want
to
explore
more
plus
ayinger
is
a
great
brewery
their
oktoberfest
beer
is
fabulous
and
its
nice
to
see
that
its
not
a
fluke
very
cloudy
rather
murky
light
brown
colour
like
most
weissbiers
it
pours
with
a
large
head
plenty
of
cloves
ripe
bananas
oak
and
hints
of
smoke
in
aroma
and
flavour
a
little
more
hops
for
the
aftertaste
would
have
been
good
but
this
is
none
the
less
a
first
class
hefeweizen
recommended
decent
brew
if
theyll
cut
the
price
in
half
ill
buy
it
twice
as
often
very
good
dunkel
weisse
alot
like
hacker
pschorrs
although
im
still
partial
to
that
brew
nice
dry
hoppy
feel
to
it
with
fruit
and
floral
tones
perhaps
not
quite
dark
enough
for
my
tastes
but
all
in
all
a
very
solid
weiss
offering
i
am
definately
going
to
pick
up
some
of
their
other
brews
to
sample
f
poured
a
medium

kohlgerman
potato
salad
you
get
the
idea
an
excellent
example
of
this

really
liked
the

bottle
cap
pours
a
murky
burnt
orange
color
with
lots
of
tiny
yeast
chunks
floating
about
a
medium
head
forms
and
disappointingly
leaves
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
enjoyably
fruity
what
a
refreshing
brew
i
notice
apple
flavor
among
the
fruitiness
character
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
medium
bodied
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
like
it
should
be
this
beer
will
definitely
be
in
my
hands
when
summer
rolls
around
pours
with
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
a
crown
that
is
a
thick
tan
head
this
may
not
be
the
king
of
beers
but
is
definitely
a
member
of
the
royal
family
this
has
a
very
pleasant
malty
nose
that
complements
the
fruity
taste
the
flavor
has
a
mild
hop
tone
that
finishes
dry
clean
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
cloudy
copper
with
a
thick
but
quickly
disipating
white
head
aroma
is
a
mixture
of
cloves
some
ripe
banana
and
grain
flavor
begins
sweet
and
grainy
with
notes
of
banana
and
clove
lingering
in
the
finish
has
a
medium
body
and
is
quite
smooth
finishing
very
wet
a
very
refreshing
dunkelweiss
one
that
i
could
enjoy
all
throughout
the
day
its
more
or
less
just
a
standard
dark
germanstyle
wheat
beer
the
odor
is
of
diluted
pinesol
not
necessarily
bad
at
all
its
got
some
subdued
lemon
character
to
the
taste
and
the
head
pours
big
but
fades
quickly
its
a
good
beer
by
all
means
its
certainly
not
exemplary
has
a
nice
frothy
head
and
a
apple
cider
color
that
was
very
hazy
yeasty
and
sour
fruit
nose
that
was
easy
to
sense
coming
from
the
large
head
has
a
great
champagne
mouth
feel
and
goes
down
smoth
tastes
of
sweet
nut
and
malty
ripe
banana
also
a
dry
with
a
teasty
tart
finish
very
drinkable
and
could
enjoy
in
a
long
drinking
session
another
beer
that
seems
to
remind
me
of
banana
nut
bread
it
pours
a
very
hazy
copper
color
and
the
smell
is
of
nuts
banana
and
malt
the
taste
had
fruit
and
malts
as
well
nothing
in
this
brew
was
overpowering
there
was
plenty
of
yeast
to
be
seen
in
my
sample
i
do
not
know
how
much
experience
i
have
with
this
style
of
beer
but
i
found
it
to
be
a
refreshing
type
beer
overall
its
drinkability
would
be
defined
as
easy
and
light
there
was
a
tingling
carbonation
as
you
would
expect
out
of
a
weisse
following
that
loads
of
citrus
and
yeast
hit
your
tongue
the
beer
was
very
refreshing
and
smooth
the
citrus
was
balanced
by
some
malts
that
made
it
less
bitter
than
the
initial
flavor
there
was
a
lot
of
flavor
and
the
complexity
was
very
inviting
as
it
is
a
dunkelweisse
the
subtle
roastiness
is
evident
after
paying
close
attention
to
the
flavor
you
will
pick
up
some
dark
malts
just
before
the
aftertaste
of
this
brew
it
is
not
as
roasty
and
dark
as
i
had
expected
but
it
is
still
a
wonderful
brew
by
aying
slightly
hazy
and
brown
capped
by
a
fizzy
fine
slightly
offwhite
lace
the
usual
aromas
associated
with
this
type
of
beer
apples
bananas
some
clove
but
much
milder
than
is
often
the
case
where
some
dunkels
are
assertive
and
stinky
this
one
was
more
passive
and
elegant
very
fizzy
in
the
mouth
but
not
over
carbonated
the
medium
body
goes
a
long
way
in
this
extremely
refreshing
brew
tastes
are
in
like
with
the
aroma
but
with
a
small
amount
of
toasted
malt
while
this
is
far
from
my
favorite
style
of
beer
it
is
always
a
welcome
change
from
the
thick
rich
beers
i
often
pursue
deep
copper
colored
liquid
with
a
frothy
ivory
colored
head
that
eventually
settles
to
about
12
an
inch
a
scant
amount
of
sediment
floating
around
aromas
of
yeast
wheat
malt
and
cloves
smooth
taste
nicely
malty
clove
taste
is
not
too
overpowering
as
i
look
back
at
my
reviews
i
find
myself
liking
this
brewery
more
more
always
available
at
my
local
store
good
variety
of
styles
and
the
price
is
right
recommended
the
beer
was
light
brown
in
color
with
a
moderately
thick
hear
that
lasted
a
long
time
it
had
a
very
gentle
malt
aroma
with
a
mild
clover
smell
there
was
no
hop
smell
the
malt
flavors
were
prominent
at
first
sip
but
finished
with
a
spicy
clove
flavor
there
is
no
bitterness
nor
hop
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
full
and
had
a
high
carbonation
level
which
tingled
the
tongue
dunkle
weizen
is
my
favorite
beer
so
i
am
a
little
prejudice
but
this
is
probably
the
best
of
style
and
the
best

pours
a
hazy

color
with
a

that
dissipates
into
a
nice

very

aroma
with
notes
of
ripe
banana
and
clove
sweet
malts
come
through
up
front
in
the
taste
along
with
some
fresh
banana
clove
and
nutmeg
its
quite
crisp
and
a
bit
acidic
feeling
in
the
mouth
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
a
very
enjoyable
brew
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
amber
color
with
a
massive
head
with
the
texture
frothy
and
the
color
and
off
white
the
lace
forms
a
fine

me
this
one
really
turned
me
on
to
the
style
which
is
now
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
a
nice
fruity
taste
with
a
hint
of

very
smooth
and
will
continue
to
be
a
big
player
in

i

overall
a

to
the

drinkability
however
the

in

would
better
served
by

sure
but
falls
short
of
a

great

with

apples
with
some
light
spiciness
of
cloves
but
not
too
much
the
brew
starts
off
very
fruity
with
banana
and
some
slightly
tart
possible
apple
flavors
before
going
into
the
sweeter
side
and
hitting
up
the
malt
there
are
some
lingering
chocolate
tones
towards
the
end
and
you
are
left
wanting
more
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
just
the
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
that
makes
this
brew
very
drinkable

another

certainly
suggest

this
is
another
great
one
with
an
applecidertea
color
a
choppy
head
that
dissipates
and
a
leathery
aroma
i
like
the
unusual
impenetrably
cloudy
appearance
but
it
may
put
others
off
and
the
leatherglove

is
weird
but
i
liked
it
the
taste
is
great
tangy

spicy
cloves
hints
of
vanilla
banana
apple
and
perhaps
clay
finish
is
delicious
and
makes
you
want
more
and
more
while
refreshing
your
thirst
at
the
same
time
ive
never
had
a
weisse
quite
like
this
and
i
loved
it
for
its
uniqueness
although
there
is
a
vague
plastic
quality
that
might
bother
others
but
to
me
ayinger
can
do
no
wrong
i
imagine
this
beer
could
go
with
anything
but
it
made
me
especially
crave
a
mediumwell
hamburger
a
nice
pour
with
a
good
lasting
head
and
attractive
color
smell
and
taste
are
sophisticated
yet
well
integrated
a
tad
heavy
for
a
wheat
an
excellent
pairing
with
a
meal
pours
a
cloudy
amber
brown
color
with
a
huge
creamy
offwhite
head
on
the
nose
there
is
complex
fruitiness
and
almost
gives
off
a
tiny
hint
of
smokiness
i
could
be
wrong
though
on
the
palate
there
is
traces
of
bananas
cloves
apples
and
pears
all
rolled
up
together
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
i
do
enjoy
one
during
lunch
with
a
good
meal
i
havent
had
many
dunkelweizens
but
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
better
versions
i
tasted
overall
good
brew
okay
this
beer
has
a
nice
light
amber
color
to
it
and
slight
aroma
the
head
is
a
medium
tan
but
it
didnt
hold
but
i
dont
know
how
long
it
had
been
on
the

the

has
some

a

a

brew

falls
flat
great
beer
it
was
like
a
great
schwarzbier
but
with
the
added
flavors
and
tickle
of
a
great
weizen
almost
like
monchof
schwarzbier
made
love
to
some
vitus
and
had
a
healthy
offspring
i
had
it
in
a
glass
as
always
but
it
was
funmny
to
read
the
text
on
the
back
which
read
something
to
the
tune
of
hefeweissbier
should
always
be
enjoyed
from
a
glass
never
the
bottle
looked
nice
and
dark
with
substantial
aromatic
head
carbonation
was
nice
and
the
drinking
was
refreshing
good
stuff
overall
really
easy
drinking
but
nothing
about
this
beer
really
grabs
the
drinker
overall
malt
sweetness
really
makes
itself
known
throughout
slightly
different
than
a
dunkelweizen
and
not
quite
a
full
schwarzbier
but
firmly
in
the
middle
the
bottle
was
one
of
those
cool
german
flip
tops
that
made
a
loud
pop
when
i
opened
it
it
poured
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
full
head
with
great
retention
overall
the
palate
was
light
and
thin
for
such
a
dark
beer
and
the
flavor
was
subtle
with
roasted
malt
caramel
and
a
bit
of
wheat
the
flavors
became
more
pronounced
and
complex
as
it
warmed
this
was
definitely
a
lighter
beer
than
i
was
expecting
but
a
solid
german
beer
nonetheless
and
highly
drinkable
if
i
didnt
know
better
id
swear
there
was
some
oats
in
this
brew
its
creamy
and
varied
in
flavoraroma
and
its
not
too
heavy
one
of
the
best
weizens
ive
had
in
a
long
time
o
if
i
didnt
look
at
the
label
i
would
have
guessed
this
as
a
straight
schwarzbier
not
bad
but
i
do
like
the
esters
the
come
through
with
hefe
yeasts
which
i
didnt
get
in
this
beer
a
fairly
decent
beer
tastes
authentic
but
not
really
a
favorite
style
of
mine
taste
is
balanced
zestywiny
roasty
grain
gentle
but
longlasting
not
strong
but
wellrounded
and
very
engaging

little

with
a
1
inch

of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the

down
smell
is

roasted

and
some
slight
cocoa

taste
is
of
dark
roasted

burnt
coffee
and
slight
cocoa
bean
flavors
there
is
a
very
mild
roasty
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
smell
is
somewhat
lacking
compared
to
the
taste
rjt
thinner
than
i
expected
good
carbonation
quite
drinkable
overall
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
probably
wont
get
one
again
but
would
drink
it
if
someone
offered
me
one
overall
this
is
a
great
tasty
beer
its
sweet
but
not
too
sweet
nice
blend
of
tastes
im
impressed
notes
this
is
amazing
very
drinkable
anda
very
smooth
finish
cheers
dark
rich
looking
like
a
stout
surprised
how
thin
it
tastes
almost
watery
it
certainly
looks
like
the
type
of
dark
beer
for
a
cold
winters
night
but
the
taste
is
closer
to
a
thin
pilsner
or
even
a
hefe
it
just
felt
like
it
was
missing
that
richness
a
dark
beer
usually
delivers
even
so
i
thought
it
was
pretty
enjoyable
and
is
great
if
you
want
a
dark
beer
without
that
dark
beer
weight
in
taste
but
it
can
be
deceptive
if
you
want
a
dark
beer
and
all
the
elements
a
dark
heavy
beer
delivers
poured
a
half
inch
beige
head
which
faded
fast
dark
raw
umber
brown
body
almost
coffee
smells
of
malt
and
bready
yeast
the
tast
is
an
interesting
combo
with
roasted
malt
cola
sour
rye
even
a
little
tart
fruit
theres
an
interesting
acidic
sour
zing
which
reminds
me
of
the
start
of
a
mild
sour
beer
the
body
seems
creamy
like
a
stout
yet
is
very
light
finish
is
fairly
long
i
was
really
pretty
impressed
o
a
bit
uneven
beer
but
drinkable
nonetheless
its
dark
chocolate
both
in
color
and
in
primary
aroma
one
finger
foamy
white
head
with
really
amazing
retention
time
holding
the
glass
up
close
to
a
light
source
reveals
that
there
is
actually
a
remarkable
lack
of
sediment
for
something
so
chewy
and
toothsome
in
texture
smell
mostly
like
a
turbo
charged
chocolate
malt
and
very
little
of
the
expected
banana
bread
it
may
have
been
mentioned
before
but
this
beer
really
does
smell
more
like
a
schwarz
profile
chocolate
chicory
roastiness
and
a
certain
level
of
acridness
and
taste
more
like
the
cloven
banana
bread
of
a
weizen
profile
not
that
im
saying
that
the
schwarzlike
flavors
arent
there
they
just
push
back
further
into
the
background
while
the
wheat
comes
forward
for
a
turn
its
really
odd
how
they
take
turns
on
your
tongue
like
that
body
is
well
carbonated
medium
thick
and
manages
to
remain
refreshing
for
it
despite
the
relative
boldness
of
the
flavors
contained
within
well
worth
trying
just
on
novelty
factor
alone
but
also
exhibits
some
real
care
and
craftsmanship
behind
the
scenes
straight
4s
across
the
board
blackbier
the
literal
traslation
from
german
there
is
no
mistaking
this
bier
for
anything
else
i
am
normally
a
fan
of
dark
bier
and
the
one
was
very
good
but
the
only
thing
is
it
really
is
black
as
night
and
it
a
bit
more
challenging
for
me
to
drink
because
of
that
if
you
say
the
blacker
the
better
than
buy
this
the
feel
can
use
a
bit
more
bubble
to
cleanse
the
palate
and
give
more
weizen
character
otherweiz
this
is
a
nice
beer
with
a
bit
of
a
twist
on
the
style
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
variation
on
the
weissbier
theme
the
components
were
unique
and
enjoyable
one
i
would
drink
again
d
quite
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
and
bubbly
but
finishes
nicely
overall
kapuziner
is
a
excellent
authentic
german
weizen
but
it
still
leaves
you
wanting
a
bit
more
pours
black
with
a
somewhat
slight
head
that
fades
t
a
ring
and
leaves
just
the
barest
lacing
smells
bready
with
a
slight
tang
of
the
grain
and
a
note
of
caraway
a
very
light
beer
one
of
the
lighter
dark
beers
ive
had
the
problem
here
is
that
there
is
a
slight
very
slight
roastiness
which
doesnt
add
a
lot
to
the
beer
in
itself
but
does
negate
any
yeasty
flavors
and
once
again
there
arent
a
lot
for
me
one
of
the
great
pleasures
of
a
german
wheat
beer
are
the
esters
from
the
yeast
with
its
hallmark
flavors
of
banana
and
clove
set
against
the
backdrop
of
the
soft
wheat
unfortunately
i
dont
get
that
here
at
all
and
there
is
no
great
roastiness
or
maltiness
to
compensate
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
hold
my
interest
a
good
dunkel
and
would
drink
more
no
problem
d
flavors
arent
the
usual
german
wheat
beer
taste
such
as
clove
and
banana
still
the
beer
is
enjoyable
clean
and
refreshing
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
color
with
a
large
tan
head
smells
of
roasted
malts
coffee
and
brown
sugar
the
feel
is
sort
of
light
the
taste
is
also
a
little
light
i
get
lots
of
coffee
and
a
little
roasted
malts
but
its
also
a
little
watery
overall
not
bad
but
i
expected
a
little
more
from
the
look
this
ones
is
subtle
yet
aggresive
and
packed
with
different
nuances
to
be
discovered
a
solid
beer
yet
not
great
o
not
a
good
example
of
what
beer
can
be
the
beer
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
wheat
with
some
light
chocolate
and
banana
notes
i
get
some
classic
german
yeast
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
flavor
is
full
of
chocolate
and
wheat
i
dont
get
any
banana
or
spice
notes
in
the
flavor
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
decent
dunkelweizen
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
i
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
and
prefer
it
to
kapuziner
weissbier
od
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
to
be
honest
its
pretty
run
of
the
mill
but
worth
a
shot
if
youre
into
the
heferoos
not
entirely
hateful
but
this
is
not
what
i
want
in
the
style
what
was
there
was
ok
but
missing
a
ton
this
is
much
darker
and
drier
than
most
dunkelweizen
i
can
see
where
it
gets
its
schwarz
moniker
overall
a
decent
beer
though
the
standard
kapuziner
hefeweizen
is
far
better
overall
it
looks
good
and
smells
good
but
seriously
lacks
flavour
opinion
well
this
is
my
first
beer
of
the
night
so
this
may
be
influencing
my
opinion
but
i
have
enjoyed
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
like
the
malt
balance
compared
to
the
yeast
and
the
fact
that
even
though
the
beer
is
opaque
you
dont
get
any
harshness
or
acidity
from
the
dark
malts
all
this
said
i
doubt
that
i
will
be
buying
this
beer
much
more
when
there
is
kostritzer
out
there
that
imo
is
superior
to
this
beer
though
they
are
different
technology

for

odd

augmented
by

the

a

then
you
have
where
this

is
going

a
touch
darker
than
the

as
well

is
subdued
with
some
earth
and
some
light
wheat
flavor
begins
with
a
dryish
cocoachocolate
entry
then
switches
to
a
tangy
weizen
finish
as
it
warms
the
wheat
takes
a
back
seat
and
sort
of
blends
more
giving
this
one
a
single
distinct
taste
overall
not
bad
as
its
a
unique
take
on
a
weizen
tan
head
that
receded
to
a
thin
coating

the

brings
out
the
wheat

so
i
have
to
admit
when
i
saw
this
lone
you
could
definitely
tell
it
was
a

as
the
classic
flavor
was
there
the
beer
still
holds
up
and
remains
the
easy

it
was
before
im
glad
that
i
bought

this

i

an

i
dont

i
will
ever

it

the

its
definitely
different
than
other
dunkel

ive
tried
banana
is
definitely
noticeable

so
is
roasted

high
hopes
kapuziner
schwarzweizen
isnt
the
dunkel
equivalent
of
the
outstanding
kapuziner
weissbier
it
is
however
an
original
creation
that
attempts
to
combine
two
not
dissimilar
styles
and
manages
to
pull
it
off
i
recommend
it
for
the
novelty
factor
alone
thankfully
its
also
good
beer
flavor
is
some
sweet
chocolate
and
brown
sugar
but
mild
overall
just
a
faint
hint
of
cloves
resurface
on
the
finish
no
hint
of

this
i
an

would

doughy
banana
aromas
upon
pouring
not

after
a

when
all
i
can
pick
up
is
some
zesty
floral
notes
light
flavor
refreshing
wheat
and
yeast
mainly
with
some
underlzing
chocolate
there
is
a
tinge
of
sourness
that
comes
off
as
lemony
in
most
wheat
beers
but
for
some
reason
makes
me
think
of
sour
cherries
possibly
the
mix
of
dark
malts
with
the
lemony
flavor
i
dont
think
its
bad
but
it
does
seam
out
of
place
finishes
fairly
clean
leaving
a
feeling
of
carbonic
acid
in
my
mouth
and
burps
of
yeasty
banana
mouthfeel
is
just
ok
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
abbrasive
and
not

i
was
expecting
it
tastes
like
the
diluted
a
really
good
dunkel
weizen
with
about
20
sparkling
water
mouthfeel
is
pretty
empty
and
drinkability
is
lower
because
of
the
dryness
well
im
glad
i
tried
this
an
interesting
hybrid
style
that
doesnt
quite
work
for
me
its
drinkable

one
is
plenty

i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
try
it
this
is
how
i
like
my
smoked
beers
the
smoke
is
not
overpowering
and
really
compliments
the
rest
of
the
flavors
the
smoke
stays
through
almost
the
entire
taste
including
the
ending
the
ending
also
has
a
slight
bitterness
that
makes
it
a
bit
dry
the
sweetness
chocolate
coffee
and
malt
is
mostly
in
the
beginning
much
more
complex
than
i
would
have
thought
very
easy
drinking
just
a
great
solid
beer
i
will
look
for
the
weisbeir
in
this
line
as
well
taste
nice
wheaty
bread
dough
with
dark
chocolate
malts
on
the
initial
sips
it
has
a
little
lemon
to
it
with

and
just
some
hints
of
bananas
as
it
gets
warmer
theres
a
bit
of
a

bitterness
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
very
drinkable
medium
mouth
with
lots
of
carbonation
not
too
much
tingle
but
enough
to
move
things
along
nicely
good
beer
i
like
this
almost
as
much
as
aventinus
a
great
beer
overall
a
great
beer
that
im
very
delighted
i
found
at
the
cloverleaf
in
metro
detroit
the
leathery
flavor
is
quite
unique
and
a
bit
puzzling
but
i
think
i
like
it
more
now
that
im
close

spice
banana

with
just
a

all
of
this
is
followed
by
a
mellow

lingers
very
nicely
blending
with
the
spiciness
to
form
a
smooth
mosaic
of
pleasure
throughout
the
mouth
nice
overall
distinct
and
moderately
flavorful
but
mild
o
this
at
first
was
drinking
like
a
porter
until
the
subtle
sweet
fruit
came
in
on
the
tale
end
a
decent
beer
but
not
a
huge
success
i
would
drink
this
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
o
wasnt
bad
would
get
again
i
had
this
as
a
fresh
bottle
and
later
aged
nine
months
with
no
significant
effect
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
works
well
with
sausage
or
kielbasa
this
beer
pours
with
a
muddy
nearopaque
dark
cola
brown
with
almost
no
head
at
all
the
aroma
is
dark
and
fruity
with
a
light
cherrylike
sweetness
and
a
little
brown
sugar
overlaid
on
a
bed
of
cereal
grains
the
flavor
is
likewise
fruity
and
sweet
against
a
nutty
dry
graininess
there
is
also
a
bit
of
astringency
and
some
mild
but
noticeable
alcohol
burn
that
distract
from
the
initial
flavor
profile
it
has
a
nice
lightmedium
body
but
the
texture
is
a
bit
too
drying
in
the
end
this
beer
has
an
interesting
flavor
profile
but
a
few
negative
characteristics
drag
down
the
overall
impression
smooth
kinda
coarse
and
airy
lightish
i
guess
o
not
to
overly
impressed
with
this
one
didnt
seem
to
have
alot
that
just
jumped
out
at
me
so
so
chalky
palates
and
flavor
throughout
the
whole
beer
roasty
and
toasty
malts
with
some
dry
powdered
fruit
flavors
as
well
palate
is
pretty
thin
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
not
full
on
flavor
pours
a
dark
brown
w
reddish
highlights
when
held
to
the
light
this
beer
has
a
massive
two
and
a
half
finger
chocolate
colored
head
which
lasts
for
a
while
the
nose
is
chocolate
dark
fruit
roasted
malt
and
some
phenol
smells
the
taste
is
coffee
chocolate
roasted
malt
dark
fruit
very
malty
and
chewy
brew
feel
is
medium
full
with
a
definite
chewy
vibe
to
it
big
full
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
beer
and
an
interesting
style
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
drinks
more
like
a
porter
than
a
wheat
beer
but
enjoyable
on
a
cold
night
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
i
think
as
it
warmed
up
it
got
better
and
more
swet
dark
fruits
came
out
though
the
taste
was
still
dominated
by
roasted
malts
something
id
have
again
d
not
familiar
with
this
style
of
beer
i
figured
it
would
be
close
to
a
dunkel
but
it
is
similar
to
a
porterlike
tasting
brew
it
pours
a
very
dark
and
dirty
raisin
brown
in
color
with
an
off
white
head
that
quickly
turns
into
a
light
lacing
around
my
snifter
the
nose
isnt
what
i
expected
at
all
i
expected
almost
dunkel
like
aromas
but
instead
you
get
a
lot
of
crystal
malts
which
gives
you
a
light
cocoa
aroma
very
interesting
you
dont
get
too
many
american
wheat
characteristics
but
it
is
appealing
the
flavors
too
are
heavy
on
the
crystal
malts
and
light
cocoa
you
also
get
a
slight
fruity
sweetness
and
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
again
very
interesting
it
drinks
pretty
thicker
in
body
but
finishes
light
hard
to
explain
but
it
doesnt
drink
like
youd
assume
it
to
for
its
weight
overall
its
a
solid
beer
and
reminds
me
more
of
a
darker
irish
ale
or
something
of
that
sort
and
not
a
wheat
beer

quite
satisfying
this
beer
is
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
the
bitterness
dies
down
as
you
drink
it
on
the
whole
an
average
malty
brew
more
flavor
than
most
american
pale
wheat
ales
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
sweetness
and
spice
taste
is
also
rather
mild
some
malts
spices
a
touch
of
sweetness
rather
subdued
flavor
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
special
the
cpj
pours
a
rich
dark
burnt
caramel
hue
with
a
pleasantly
foamy
buffcolored
head
of
a
solid
finger
impressive
retention
with
solid
lacing
aroma
is
subtle
and
earthy
with
hints
of
cocoa
cinnamon
dirt
and
burnt
sugar
hints
of
cherries
and
rum
taste
is
mild
wheat
with
some
bright
sour
cherry
and
caramel
highlights
cocoa
and
toffee
through
the
middle
with
a
light
molasses
and
caramel
finish
not
bad
with
there
was
a
bit
more
flavor
it
seems
a
touch
muted
and
muddled
but
certainly
aint
bad
mouth
is
bright
with
ample
carbonation
good
medium
body
for
the
style
and
it
works
nicely
with
the
hint
of
tartness
in
the
barely
slick
finish
all
in
all
not
a
bad
dark
wheat
id
drink
one
again
any
day
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
unibroue
tulip
thin
head
with
little
lacing
color
is
a
murky
mysterious
opalescent
tudor
brown
aroma
consists
of
notes
of
dark
fruits
banana
and
brown
sugar
and
maybe
a
touch
of
coffee
taste
has
some
malty
sweetness
with
some
hints
of
alcohol
some
of
the
aromas
are
echoed
in
the
taste
not
a
delicious
beer
but
quite
solid
very
drinkable
overall
an
ok
beer
but
not
even
close
to
their
best
offering
its
drinkable
but
i
probably
wont
go
back
to
it
cheers
poured
a
brown
body
with
minimal
head
and
lace
on
top
of
a
light
citric
and
clove
smell
but
mostly
im
picking
up
some
bread
and
sweet
malt
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
lighttomedium
body
a
decent
sweet
edge
of
caramel
and
some
chocolate
and
i
pick
up
a
touch
of
dough
for
light
bready
dryness
the
hefe
qualities
citric
and
spice
notes
are
very
minimal
and
come
across
as
slightly
bitter
a
dry
finish
to
a
beer
that
while
not
bad
is
not
the
most
exciting
d
this
beer
was
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
and
did
not
live
up
to
the
nose
it
didnt
taste
good
and
was
hard
to
finish
the
body
is
also
on
the
light
side
with
high
carbonationthis
isnt
a
style
im
very
fond
of
to
start
with
but
i
didnt
love
this
beer
and
dont
think
ill
be
drinking
it
again
d
all
in
all
a
decent
though
not
necessarily
standout
beer
hv
without
a
doubt
this
is
an
interesting
and
tasty
winter
seasonal
worth
a
try
poured
from
a
growler
into
an
irish
pint
glass
murky
dank
looking
concoction
very
medium
brown
of
the
opaque
variety
must
be
unfiltered
grains
seem
to
dominate
the
nose
with
some
hints
of
sourness
and
dark
fruit
nice
grainey
flavors
dominate
here
with
enough
hop
to
pick
out
but
that
is
all
with
all
of
that
said
this
beer
seems
to
really
come
through
on
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
for
me
nice
fresh
even
medium
mouthfeel
and
carbonation
make
for
a
very
sessionable
beer
buckwheat
after
dark
is
pretty
solid
for
the
most
part
it
has
more
depth
of
flavors
than
i
was
expecting
for
whatever
reason
if
nothing
else
it
has
encouraged
me
to
enjoy
it
quickly
d
it
is
a
damn
fine
brew
and
i
hope
to
see
it
in
bottles
soon
a
different
style
for
sure
i
like
it
definetely
the
best
ive
had
from
rj
overall
impression
pretty
nice
brew
here
recommended
served
from
tap
into
an
rj
rockers
shaker
poured
a
murky
deep
brown
with
a
minimal
offwhite
head
maintained
decent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
and
grains
the
flavor
was
of
malt
rye
and
bananas
it
had
a
medium
feel
on
the
palate
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
however
it
was
not
really
what
i
was
expecting
from
this
brew
this
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
by
the
way
flavors
were
very
nice
and
balanced
i
just
wish
the
aroma
would
have
been
a
little
more
pronounced
as
i
had
to
search
high
and
low
to
find
it
cant
wait
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
to
compare
d
not
interesting
not
drinkable
drinkability
its
drinkable
i
just
wish
that
the
taste
remained
longer
or
that
something
else
was
going
on
with
this
brew
the
body
was
medium
smooth
and
to
the
point
nice
body
from
the
wheat
with
a
hint
of
chocolate
very
very
drinkable
it
has
and
creates
this
amazingly
smooth
drinkablitlity
with
a
great
mouthfeel
it
leaves
a
nice
light
chocolate
taste
in
your
mouth
as
the
nice
frothy
head
stays
with
it
till
the
end
it
is
by
far
the
best
beer
on
tap
at
the
new
tap
room
in
downtown
spartanburg
the
only
complaint
i
have
aboutbuckwheat
after
dark
is
that
it
is
not
bottled
i
have
found
myself
though
getting
growlers
of
it
in
the
meantime
tried
this
one
on
draft
at
terrys
tap
room
in
spartanburg
i
havent
had
much
experience
with
the
dunkelweizens
especially
living
here
in
sc
so
i
was
anxious
to
give
this
offering
by
rockers
a
try
this
one
pours
a
hazy
deep
brown
with
inch
creamy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
thin
at
the
end
unlike
a
traditional
dunkel
the
esters
really
seem
to
be
prevalent
in
the
aroma
taste
reminds
me
of
rjrs
hefe
buckwheat
but
has
more
of
a
chocolatey
profile
i
guess
thats
why
they
call
it
buckwheat
after
dark
or
simply
bad
ale
as
the
bartender
called
it
mouthfeel
is
definitely
heavier
than
the
average
wheat
and
carbonation
levels
are
about
what
you
would
expect
i
found
myself
reordering
this
one
throughout
the
evening
overall
this
one
is
another
awesome
beer
from
rjr
i
cant
believe
im
the
first
to
review
it
its
been
out
for
months
very
crisp
and
satisfying
but
with
a
rather
straightforward
flavor
for
the
style
its
not
at
all
bad
but
it
could
benefit
from
greater
sweetness
a
more
notable
malt
presence
and
softer
carbonation
a
surprisingly
light
dunkelwiezen
much
more
gulpable
than
the
pale

spot
of
the
style
i
was
thinking
about
going
with
3
75s
for
the
taste
feel
and
overall
rating
but
this
is
an
excellent
beer
for
me
if
i
want
something
of
the
style
silky
feel
on
it
pleasant
lingering
slightly
spicy
and
tangy
banana
biscuit
aftertaste
this
is
some
good
stuff
my
first
from
hofbrau
and
it
wont
be
my
last
serving
type
bottle
which
is
not
good
because
usual
my
profile
pics
from
the
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
and
i
was
pretty
happy
to
have
this
little
memory
show
up
on
the
shelf
here
in
alberta
an
adequately
enjoyable
dunkelweizen
the
lack
of
expected
roasted
notes
while
a
concern
at
first
fades
from
worry
rather
quickly
leaving
us
with
a
nice
fruity
quaff
suitable
for
summertime
excursions
and
early
spring
snow
days
alike
the
quaffable
quality
is
so
good
worthy
dunkelweizen
o
a
really
nice
dunkelweizen
at
a
good
price
perhaps
the
taste
let
me
down
a
bit
after
such
a
great
aroma
and
there
is
a
bit
of
a
metallic
finish
o
nothing
fantastic
and
there
are
much
better
examples
of
the
style
o
very
drinkable
beer
creamy
and
pleasant
flavor
is
again
on
par
with
the
style
guidelines
but
in
terms
of
the
mouthfeel
its
a
letdown
too
thin
and
metallic
not
enough
good
bubbles
and
the
ones
present
are
a
little
abrasive
drinkable
and
decent
but
the
overall
attenuation
is
off
and
it
takes
away
from
drinking
this
style
this
beer
is
highly
enjoyable
being
a
bit
sweeter
and
more
complex
than
its
lighter
sister
hofbräu
nailed
the
style
because
they
probably
invented
it
d
it
is
certainly
an
easy
drinking
beer
interchageable
with
the
hefe
so
far
the
best
hofbrau
beer
ive
tasted
and
will
be
my
choice
when
i
visit
hb
until
its
gone

i
could

some

pleasant

i

this
beer
pours
a

color
with

thick

the
foam
is
a
light
shade

the

clearly
has
a
wheat
character
backed
by
a
little
caramel

toasted
grain
not
bad
the
taste
is
a

presents
a
nice

twang
theres
a

and
some
roastedness
in
in
the
flavor
was
well
medium
in
body
with
a
sharp
slightly
acidic
bite
in

this
is
a
very
engaging
and
drinkable
beer
enjoyable
and
worth
having
again
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
hofbrauhaus
in
munich
presented
in
a
0
5l
weisse
glass
it
was
a
dark
copper
color
very
hazy
with
a
light
tan
almost
white
foam
on
top
that
lasted
halfway
through
the
session
the
aroma
was
correct
in
my
opinion
bananas
and
cloves
all
the
way
this
translated
to
the
taste
as
well
nice
estery
flavors
from
the
yeast
and
good
solid
mouthfeel
not
thick
per
se
but
it
coated
the
mouth
very
well
solid
and
drinkable
i
liked
this
best
from
the
hofbrauhaus
but
im
partial
to
weizenbocks
and
dunkel
weisse
beers
this
is
one
of
the
finest
dark
wheat
beers
i
have
tasted
although
i
am
far
from
an
expert
on
the
style
final
notes
a
really
nice
option
to
the
style
it
has
its
own
personality
a
really
nice
beer
good
and
thirst
quenching
beer
after
all
even
if
id
like
it
a
little
less
sweet
500
ml
bottle
bought
in
norway
pours
with
the
typical
large
lingering
weissbier
head
colour
of
the
beer
is
brown
not
black
as
the
name
suggests
slightly
hazy
pleasant
aroma
of
fresh
baked
bread
and
weissbier
yeast
hints
of
dark
syrup
and
caramel
flavour
has
a
slight
roastiness
and
some
farmhouse
bread
character
smooth
and
pleasant
to
drink
but
not
very
complex
just
enough
hops
to
leave
a
pleasant
aftertaste
but
like
most
weissbiers
the
aftertaste
does
not
last
forever
this
is
a
decent
but
unpretentious
beer
a
nice
accompaniment
with
a
meal
or
as
a
refreshment
on
its
own
this
is
an
interesting
seasonal
from
hofbrauhaus
they
called
it
a
darkweiz
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
aroma
is
a
little
fruity
and
a
little
wheaty
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
dunkelweizen
style
but
the
flavor
was
a
mixture
of
malt
cider
banana
and
caramel
smooth
and
mostly
drinkable
but
lopsided
i
would
go
back
to
the
dunkel
next
time
had
this
with
some
bratwursts
and
sauerkraut
at
hofbrau
munchen
in
panama
city
fl
at
pier
park
paired
very
well
with
my
meal
and
as
far
as
i
know
you
can
only
get
this
beer
at
their
restaurantsgastropubs
not
the
best
dunkelweizen
ive
had
but
solid
nontheless
and
a
great
accompaniment
to
german
cuisine
a
touch
more
malt
body
and
lose
the
light
metallic
character
and
this
would
be
fantastic
enjoyed
12
oz
at
beer
revolution
a
reddish
murky
brown
about
as
dark
as
some
north
american
brewed
weizenbocks
with
an
unassuming
tan
head
smells
like
the
expected
banana
and
clove
yeast
flavors
with
the
banana
predominating
along
with
smooth
caramel
and
a
tinge
of
citrus
rind
this
was
just
what
the
doctor
ordered
after
recently
trying
some
fairly
sour
dunkelweizens
that
underachieved
in
the
malt
department
a
nice
rich
malt
complexity
almost
smoky
with
subtle
dried
apricot
notes
potent
yet
refined
very
bananaforward
with
clove
present
as
well
but
relatively
downplayed
i
do
not
taste
much
in
the
way
of
citrus
but
there
is
an
earthy
root
cellar
spice
in
the
finish
not
super
sticky
or
thick
but
does
have
some
chew
and
pleasingly
enough
the
spice
builds
on
the
palate
as
you
go
drying
things
out
and
providing
a
nice
contrast
to
the
rich
malty
and
fruity
beginning
and
middle
this
is
how
this
style
ought
to
be
executed
says
the
nongerman
amateur
beer
geek
if
nothing
else
i
try
to
pay
close
attention
and
this
was
well
worth
the
mental
effort
i
have
bought
many
a
dunkle
weiss
in
the
states
and
have
been
unable
to
find
anything
close
to
how
good
this
beer
is
if
you
ever
come
across
this
beer
do
yourself
a
favor
and
order
a
full
liter
a
classic
dunkelweizen
that
favors
banana
esters
and
malty
sweetness
over
hop
balance
and
acidity
a
great
variance
to
many
of
the
the
more
zesty
or
lemony
wheat
beers
out
there
overall
this
beer
is
named
after
the
foam
on
the
surf
around
the
island
it
comes
from
amber
in
colour
this
dark
white
beer
drinks
like
an
ale
i
really
liked
this
beer
and
could
drink
it
as
well
as
kilkenny
which
is
probably
my
favourite
beer
from
ireland
not
really
your
typical
hefeweizen
remember
this
to
be
even
more
sour
on
tab
the
suspended
yeast
definitely
does
it
some
good
by
adding
the
creaminess
smell
is
nice
and
taste
is
a
bit
strange
for
the
style
but
i
do
like
it
most
of
the
time
texels
skuumkoppe
is
a
very
friendly
soft
easygoing
ale
someone
craving
a
rich
dunkelweizen
might
find
it
leans
a
little
too
much
to
the
hefeweizen
side
of
wheat
beers
but
thats
really
only
a
concern
for
style
guideline
sticklers
that
cant
handle
it
when
lines
are
blurred
normal
people
should
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
single
bad
thing
to
say
about
it
it
is
not
very
strong
so
it
would
be
sessionable
and
the
tartness
gives
it
something
special
never
again
in
this
lifetime
started
off
right
from
the
fridge
couldnt
wait
got
a
lot
nicer
after
letting
it
warm
up
cheers
update
from
july
2011
i
had
this
beer
in
a
bar
in
bergan
at
sea
and
i
must
say
that
this
bottle
tasted
much
better
than
the
last
one
this
dark
whitebeer
looked
very
nice
with
its
dark
fluid
and
much
carbonation
going
on
the
glass
thats
what
i
like
drank
this
thinking
it
was
a
blonde
and
looking
back
i
still
dont
see
where
this
would
line
up
as
dunkelweizen
wheat
character
is
largely
absent
indistinct
either
way
maybe
it
does
better
in
bottles
but
as
is
its
only
good
as
a
hot
day
quencher
ok
drinkable
its
not
too
high
abv
but
the
alcohol
is
present
and
noticable
d
a
pretty
original
beer
i
really
like
this
beer
and
even
better
to
drink
it
while
being
on
texel
the
best
of
this
brewery
in
my
humble
opinion
drink
and
drink
again
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
but
has
character
it
is
a
full
flavored
beer
that
is
hard
to
describe
if
i
had
to
call
it
anything
id
say
it
is
half
german
dunkel
and
half
belgian
wit
overall
after
a
bad
first
impression
the
head
of
the
beer
is
horribly
messy
and
almost
nonexistent
this
beer
strikes
back
with
the
taste
it
was
easy
to
drink
on
this
warm
summer
day
and
is
very
well
balanced
would
like
to
have
this
one
again
md
a
naturally
mildly
spritzy
mouthfeel
of
fine
carbonation
demonstrates
the
work
of
the
yeast
sediments
in
the
bottle
although
i
find
this
beer
very
hard
to
like
i
probably
have
restricted
myself
to
the
past
experience
of
a
traditional
german
dunkel
weizen
and
this
is
a
totally
different
stuff
apart
from
this
i
really
dont
mind
trying
it
again
maybe
served
cloudy
next
time
to
see
if
theres
any
hidden
surprise
i
had
this
on
tap
at
the
café
t
arendsnest
in
amsterdam
i
didnt
know
it
was
a
dunkelweizen
when
i
ordered
it
and
it
didnt
seem
like
one
when
i
drank
it
the
beer
was
clear
amber
orange
with
thick
white
foam
and
it
almost
looked
stratified
from
orange
to
yellow
bottom
to
top
the
smell
was
hoppier
than
youd
expect
for
a
weizen
in
a
hoppy
belgian
ale
way
not
unlike
urthel
hopit
the
taste
was
also
more
like
a
hoppy
belgian
pale
ale
tasty
and
easy
to
guzzle
recommended
this
beer
does
not
have
the
dryness
and
yeast
profile
of
a
dunkel
weizen
and
is
more
a
fresh
summerbeer
rather
than
a
dark
wheat
smell
is
malty
with
roast
and
litle
yeastesters
no
off
arome
but
hardly
any
nose
for
a
6
beer
taste
is
same
story
and
feels
like
youre
drinking
a
beer
that
had
added
lots
of
extra
water
whats
there
is
some
malt
litle
wheat
carracter
and
hint
of
roast
all
in
all
a
rather
dull
beer
but
drinkable
be
aware
though
it
doesnt
taste
that
it
has
alcohol
and
it
must
have
always
pleasure
to
drink
dunkelweizen
with
a
good
balance
between
drinkability
and
flavor
complexity
mediumlight
body
high
soft
carbonation
creamy
mouthfeel
overall
a
flavorful
but
light
dunkelweizen
drinkable
and
pleasant
a
pleasant
beer
one
that
was
easy
to
enjoy
without
really
exciting
not
bad
quite
refreshing
but
the
hefeweizen
version
of
this
one
is
better
had
a
pint
on
tap
at
an
edmonton
alberta
area
pub
spruce
grove
to
be
specific
after
being
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
brewerys
weissbier
offering
see
that
review
i
had
fairly
high
expectations
for
this
one
certainly
this
was
technically
proficient
and
nothing
was
obviously
wrong
a
brownred
wood
color
with
ample
fizz
and
an
inch
or
so
of
beige
quickbreaking
head
aroma
features
the
expected
banana
and
clove
elements
along
with
some
caramel
and
faint
chocolate
body
is
much
like
that
of
a
lighter
macrobrewed
weiss
on
the
thin
side
and
featuring
an
applelike
fruity
young
beer
flavor
along
with
some
brown
sugar
raisin
and
clove
banana
is
low
level
at
least
to
my
palate
a
little
sour
and
quite
crisp
not
as
complex
as
its
lighter
stablemate
but
pleasant
enough
i
suppose
i
have
enjoyed
less
fruity
and
more
malty
examples
of
the
style
but
makes
a
decent
enough
patio
brew
when
in
the
mood
for
something
a
touch
darker
not
particularly
sweet
and
maybe
a
little
bland
was
hoping
for
something
more
robust
overall
a
solid
dark
hefeweizen
a
tasty
pairing
for
my
plate
of
jaegerschnitzel
and
spaetzle
o
delicious
love
this
dunkelweissen
not
usually
a
fan
of
these
but
i
am
of
this
one
could
see
it
going
well
with
cheesecake
a
slight
amber
hew
mostly
sweet
with
a
thick
mouth
feel
the
banana
flavors
of
the
yeast
dominate
the
palate
and
not
much
else
is
going
on
here
i
did
finish
my
growler
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
there
are
lots
of
better
weisse
beers
out
there
the
quest
continues
compared
to
the
regular
maisel
weisse
this
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
and
the
flavours
are
more
subdued
than
i
expected
not
a
bad
dunkel
but
this
brewer
is
known
to
be
top
shelf
in
wheat
beers
so
a
bit
of
a
drop
in
expectations
d
an
all
around
solid
beer
and
something
i
hope
to
have
again
definitely
a
step
behind
maisels
weisse
original
but
still
a
tasty
and
damn
drinkable
brew
overall
weak
offering
id
rather
have
their
standard
weisse
as
this
just
had
sooo
little
going
on
that
it
was
instantly
forgettable
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
dark
nearly
opaque
chocolaty
brown
with
a
finebubbled
light
tan
head
tempting
malty
aroma
has
hints
of
chocolate
and
caramel
flavor
such
flavor
malty
mainly
plus
caramel
horehound
earthy
and
yeasty
notes
texture
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
sharp
yeasty
undertone
and
hints
of
fruit
not
a
lot
of
fizz
definitely
worthy
of
at
least
a
sample
overall
a
fairly
ok
beer
my
only
real
problem
was
the
mouthfeel
which
was
very
weak
as
for
everything
else
it
was
ok
but
nothing
spectacular
it
has
whetted
my
appetite
for
more
dunkels
though
o
this
is
a
fine
beer
and
this
might
be
the
one
to
get
me
really
into
dunkels
its
definitely
easy
enough
to
drink
and
the
flavor
along
with
the
mouthfeel
gives
this
enough
character
to
make
me
want
to
have
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
beer
would
go
well
with
a
roast
beef
dinner
or
perhaps
with
a
chocolate
cake
for
dessert
thumbs
up
not
up
there
with
the
better
examples
of
the
style
but
still
nothing
too
be
ashamed
of
taste
is
soso
again
theres
potential
but
nothing
jumps
out
and
the
mineral
water
and
an
overall
watery
feel
make
this
an
average
offering
in
the
dunkel
department
a
deftly
easy
to
drink
dark
wheat
beer
enjoyably
straight
forward
but
hardly
plain
the
expected
yeast
and
spice
are
notably
understated
and
thats
ok
as
everything
else
is
quite
agreeable
i
could
very
much
see
ordering
this
a
few
times
over
in
any
rustic
germanic
pub
whose
doorway
i
might
darken
overall
very
nice
and
drinkable
dark
wheat
beer
dr
cheap
enough
in
germany
but
far
from
amazing
it
slides
down
easily
enough
and
is
of
normal
abv
flavour
is
on
the
clovey
side
with
slight
banana
noted
that
linger
light
carbonation
and
high
drinkability
make
this
a
winner
as
fair
as
im
concerned
i
like
the
balance
in
this
one
of
the
nicer
dunkelweizens
ive
tried
pours
dark
copper
with
a
small
for
a
weizen
head
nose
shows
bready
wheat
milk
chocolate
banana
and
oatmeal
very
nice
similar
flavours
minus
the
banana
but
not
as
complex
low
bitterness
but
a
lasting
toasty
finish
somewhat
watery
carbonation
is
nice
and
high
i
truly
love
this
style
possibly
more
than
the
regular
hefeweizen
a
solid
example
that
falls
short
of
the
benchmark
weihenstephan
but
is
still
a
very
good
beer
that
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
drinking
overall
very
drinkable
and
very
enjoyable
certainly
a
dunkel
i
could
drink
all
day
the
finish
was
a
little
odd
different
to
what
im
used
to
when
it
comes
to
various
sorts
of
german
weizen
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
id
go
for
seconds
and
thirds
overall
an
excellent
dunkel
definitely
recommended
md
the
fluffy
mouthfeel
upfront
leads
towards
a
mediumbodied
midtaste
although
the
finishing
touch
is
a
little
more
spritzy
than
necessary
all
in
all
this
dunkel
weizen
is
very
decent
in
quality
showing
a
balanced
profile
bw
fruitesters
and
wheatmalts
although
this
is
not
my
favourite
type
of
ale
i
wont
hesitate
tasting
it
again
but
preferably
on
draught
overall
not
very
impressive
average
wheat
beer
i
was
expecting
more
from
a
dunkel
weizen
i
prefer
the
original
maisels
weisse
body
is
medium
and
the
beer
is
slightly
sweet
aftertaste
is
dry
and
drinkability
is
ok
to
me
this
tastes
like
the
normal
weisse
but
with
the
dark
malt
pushing
away
the
fruity
notes
the
weisse
has
poured
a
tall
dense
foamy
light
brown
head
was
so
solid
it
looked
like
i
could
scoop
it
out
like
ice
cream
deep
cola
colored
beer
with
a
hazy
chestnut
hue
moderately
strong
aroma
is
dominated
by
banana
and
bubble
gum
esters
mouthfeel
is
light
a
fluffy
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
up
front
except
for
a
faint
astringency
mild
banana
yeast
flavors
and
some
cocoa
mix
towards
the
finish
the
aroma
hinted
at
some
nice
flavors
but
they
never
materialized
a
tad
watery
and
boring
nothing
wrong
per
se
but
there
are
better
dunkels
a
great
wheat
offering
from
a
brewery
which
as
i
understand
isnt
their
usual
highly
recommend
picking
it
up
o
a
delicious
beer
id
say
i
would
have
another
one
but
this
is
my
other
one
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
cloudy
goldenbrown
coloring
that
is
slightly
hazed
with
a
thin
filmy
coating
good
lacing
along
the
glass
the
nose
is
subtle
with
fruity
highlights
some
clove
spicing
as
well
as
some
coriander
flavors
are
heavily
spiced
with
coriander
nutmeg
and
allspice
on
a
tangy
caramel
backbone
the
aftertaste
is
a
spicy
blend
with
a
smooth
creamy
finish
interesting
brew
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
for
a
wheat
beer
but
it
gives
this
more
of
a
robust
quality
i
feel
is
appropriate
for
a
winter
beer
overall
a
nice
dunkelweizen
but
spice
qualities
overpower
the
malts
a
bit
too
much
overall
i
think
this
has
the
potential
to
be
a
quite
solid
dunkelweizen
it
would
have
been
vastly
better
if
the
spice
and
clove
was
cut
back
a
bit
in
order
to
let
the
banana
shine
and
if
it
were
carbonated
these
two
crucial
areas
really
hurt
its
overall
score
d
very
drinkable
the
banana
flavor
is
really
present
and
stays
perfectly
balanced
with
the
other
flavors
there
is
quite
a
bit
going
on
here
but
it
all
works
really
well
pours
a
moderate
brown
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
nose
is
caramel
as
well
as
banana
and
clove
the
taste
is
a
good
balance
between
caramel
sweetness
and
some
banana
and
clove
great
feel
with
a
really
nice
balance
between
the
yeast
and
malt
drinks
very
well
and
is
a
nice
take
on
the
style
d
this
is
a
tasty
brew
a
good
hefeweizen
but
still
lacks
some
of
the
smooth
wheat
character
of
a
traditional
example
i
consider
this
better
than
average
for
the
most
part
drinks
like
a
low
abv
beer
you
want
to
quaff
this
one
and
kick
back
but
its
so
well
made
you
have
to
sip
and
savor
at
least
for
the
first
glass
after
that
all
bets
are
off
then
you
have
to
watch
out
for
the
sneaky
abv
now
that
ive
had
it
im
going
to
have
to
contact
my
new
friends
in
the
area
to
procure
some
more
of
this
stuff
if
i
could
get
this
all
the
time
the
only
thing
that
would
stop
me
from
drinking
it
would
be
a
hefe
of
the
same
caliber
then
i
could
switch
beer
from
warm
months
to
cold
best
dunkel
ive
had
d
very
tasty
goes
down
quite
easily
not
too
filling

is
a
really
nice
beer

long
time

thanks
to

overall
this
was
a
very
tasty
beer
the
flavors
are
crisper
than
ive
come
to
except
from
this
family
of
beers
and
needless
to
say
i
was
impressed
worth
a
shot
and
thanks
again
for
norica
for
sending
this
one
along
poured
into

and

doesnt
get
any

aroma
and
finish
of
slight
cloves
faint
banana
in

but
predominantly
bubblegum
this
beer
blows
away
any

true
joy
to
drink

pay
more
attention
to

hope
there
is
more

a
summery
winter
wheat
or
a
wintry
summer
wheat
both
and
as
such
something
very
drinkable
throughout
the
year
recommended
by
staff
at
the
brewpub
itself
this
weizen
poured
out
a
bit
flat
with
no
head
yet
upon
sampling
had
hidden
carbonation
that
opened
up
a
nicely
complex
flavor
on
on
hand
there
was
a
slightly
christmas
quality
with
apple
ginger
hints
and
a
medium
body
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
lightness
that
displayed
lemoncloves
that
reminded
one
of
summer
not
too
sweet
nice
wheat
hops
and
definitely
an
easy
beer
to
enjoy
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
color
was
a
golden
amber
beer
was
very
cloudy
with
small
amounts
of
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
a
very
small
thin
foamy
head
disappeared
quickly
leaving
a
ring
around
the
top
aroma
was
strongly
banana
bread
and
was
slightly
sweet
with
a
dash
of
vanilla
taste
was
slightly
of
banana
bread
more
bread
than
banana
with
a
bit
of
sweet
cloves
also
a
bit
of
citrus
hiding
in
there
felt
good
in
the
mouth
coated
nicely
a
bit
of
carbonation
vey
easy
to
drink
worked
pretty
well
for
a
style
i
usually
associate
with
summer
not
winter
pours
a
hazed
copper
color
darker
around
the
edges
creamy
white
head
diminishes
but
stays
with
the
beer
for
the
duration
smells
like
banana
bread
and
im
loving
that
theres
clove
in
there
too
crazy
lingering
banana
flavor
spicy
too
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
this
is
just
excellent
i
say
this
brew
is
a
must
try
for
any
fans
of
the
style
taste
is
very
spicy
bit
malty
but
the
spiciness
really
controls
this
beer
strong
orange
taste
with
a
yeastiness
very
sweet
slight
lemonish
taste
good
carbonation
if
only
slightly
high
overall
tasty
but
the
alc
really
comes
through
for
a
5
5
beer
a
cloudy
orange
color
with
a
medium
head
and
nice
lacing
the
beer
had
a
sweet
malty
aroma
a
fruity
banana
taste
with
a
little
hoppiness
at
the
end
althought
the
hops
presence
died
out
as
i
drank
the
pint
decent
mouthfeel
and
very
drinkable
i
will
have
this
again
this
beer
was
still
on
tap
when
we
last
visited
the
brewpub
pour
when
served
was
the
color
of
burnished
copper
and
was
slightly
cloudy
the
12
inch
white
head
died
quickly
i
was
still
able
to
pick
up
on
the
bananaclovesyeastiness
in
the
aroma
medium
in
mouthfeel
tastewise
the
bananas
and
yeastiness
is
what
stood
out
for
me
i
was
wonderfully
surprised
to
see
this
beer
on
tap
today
when
i
drove
to
portsmouth
for
lunch
it
poured
a
hazy
dark
gold
color
with
little
head
or
lace
the
nose
has
the
clove
banana
and
vanilla
character
you
expect
from
a
hefe
weizen
but
there
is
a
little
caramel
not
from
the
malt
all
of
the
same
is
found
in
the
flavor
along
with
just
a
hint
of
orange
peel
and
a
little
roast
malt
character
nice
rich
smooth
mouth
feel
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
is
really
growing
on
me
im
not
sure
about
this
being
a
dunkel
great
beer
though
796
fluff
of
halfinch
head
that
stuck
and
laced
straight
down
very
pleasing
hazy
golden
honey
to
an
almost
amber
hue
with
little
discernible
action
going
on
kind
of
a
soapy
fining
note
on
nose
with
orange
peel
and
maybe
some
annise
on
the
whole
a
sedate
bouquet
that
is
difficult
to
pull
out
cloves
allspice
nutmeg
clover
honey
husky
wheat
throatiness
to
taste
that
dissipates
quickly
quite
busy
at
the
start
it
finishes
quickly
and
leaves
little
residue
huge
lingering
beige
head
translucent
cloudy
brownish
in
color
fine
lacing
as
head
diminishes
some
soapy
qualities
in
head
roasted
malt
and
banana
nose
tasting
cloves
coriander
as
well
as
some
banana
nut
bread
very
creamy
lightly
lingering
carbonation
and
somewhat
viscous
in
mouth
feel
leaves
some
acidity
and
drying
sensation
on
my
tongue
overall
well
balanced
and
not
overly
wheated
i
admire
many
of
bayerns
brews
and
applaud
their
adherence
to
the
german
purity
law
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
followers
of
this
style
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
my
first
visit
to
a
pub
in
dusseldorf
i
learned
later
that
the
amazing
beer
from
the
wooden
keg
was
called
altbier
dragons
breath
is
reminiscent
of
that
beer
deep
and
rich
in
colour
slightly
sweet
nose
plenty
of
toasty
malt
flavour
i
will
freely
admit
that
its
new
years
and
my
taste
buds
may
be
somewhat
dulled
so
i
will
keep
it
short
and
sweet
good
beer
im
looking
forward
to
trying
one
with
a
clean
palate
tomorrow
overall
a
pretty
nice
drinker
overall
with
a
good
blend
of
wheaty
and
darker
flavors
all
while
keeping
a
good
drinkability
its
a
big
and
tangy
brew
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
the
oxidized
taste
is
more
like
an
old
ale
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
special
brews
in
lynnwood
wash
got
this
from
a
friend
from
montana
murky
dark
brownmahogany
pour
with
a
two
finger
creamy
beige
head
with
decent
retention
and
nice
lacing
earthy
malty
nose
with
hints
of
brown
bread
subtle
dark
fruit
toffee
and
a
some
metalicmineral
notes
as
well
the
taste
follows
suit
with
lots
of
earthy
bready
malts
up
front
along
with
hints
of
molasses
brown
bread
toffee
dark
fruit
and
a
touch
of
banana
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
subtly
creamy
with
good
balance
and
drinkability
overall
while
this
is
not
the
dark
weizen
im
used
to
here
in
germany
its
still
a
solid
offering
o
a
very
nice
and
easy
drinking
dark
wheat
ale
which
is
a
style
i
enjoy
but
dont
see
too
often
this
beer
pours
out
a
nice
brown
with
a
nice
creamy
brownish
head
with
lots
of
lace
the
smell
is
of
fruits
with
a
hints
of
nuts
nice
really
malty
taste
that
is
just
a
touch
sweet
which
i
like
in
a
nice
dark
wheat
beer
has
a
really
smooth
finish
with
a
bit
heavy
mouth
for
a
dunkelweizen
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
goes
great
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
with
salsa
and
chips
o
this
is
a
very
highly
drinkable
ale
in
my
humble
opinion
i
would
have
no
problem
enjoying
this
beer
over
the
course
of
an
evening
and
appreciate
the
well
balanced
nature
of
the
brew
the
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
its
very
flavorful
and
rich
yet
its
also
a
very
smooth
and
light
on
the
palate
now
i
can
understand
how
this
was
brewed
in
bavaria
and
won
awards
so
many
awards
i
highly
recommend
this
overall
this
beer
is
very
unlike
most
wheat
beers
which
is
okay
by
me
since
the
bananas
and
cloves
can
get
to
be
tiresome
another
easydrinking
beer
from
bayern
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
pours
a
dark
red
amber
with
a
thin
offwhite
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
light
aroma
of
toasted
and
caramel
malt
dark
fruit
wheat
flavor
follows
with
toasted
and
sweet
malt
cloves
wheat
and
a
hint
of
grassy
hops
light
to
medium
bodied
subdued
but
very
pleasant
malt
and
wheat
flavors
well
integrated
as
another
reviewer
noted
a
nice
light
weizen
beer
but
the
dragons
breath
seems
to
indicate
something
a
little
more
dangerous
a
pleasant
lowkey
dunkelweizen
not
sure
why
a
german
style
dark
wheat
beer
thats
under
6
abv
is
called
dragons
breath
with
flames
all
over
the
label
kind
of
gimmicky
or
misleading
or
something
but
nevertheless
the
beer
isnt
all
that
bad
i
can
see
a
thick
layer
of
yeast
or
bottling
sugar
on
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
but
a
careful
pour
yields
a
slightly
murky
dark
brown
thin
liquid
with
a
half
inch
of
head
that
fades
instantly
the
nose
is
not
real
german
yeasty
at
all
nor
german
malty
really
more
american
medium
roast
barley
somewhere
between
a
porter
and
a
black
ale
in
that
regard
with
some
doughy
yeast
and
a
lightness
not
explained
by
the
color
the
taste
is
rather
generic
and
off
the
mark
a
bit
for
the
style
theyre
calling
it
but
its
a
drinkable
dark
brew
yeast
forward
but
nothing
too
interesting
nice
roast
on
the
malt
slight
chocolate
note
and
a
tad
sweet
at
the
end
still
clean
in
the
finish
and
easy
to
drink
a
fair
few
of
these
i
didnt
love
this
one
but
it
served
its
purpose
as
the
only
non
gold
craft
beer
i
could
find
at
a
town
pump
servo
in
colstrip
montana
wont
seek
this
out
again
but
it
didnt
offend
me
by
any
means
and
at
under
8
bucks
a
6
pack
i
cant
really
complain
looking
for
a
different
kind
of
bock
look
here
this
is
not
your
typical
cloveandbanana
german
wheat
beer
profile
its
more
of
a
rustic
altbier
yeast
with
some
depth
to
keep
things
interesting
o
tasty
but
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
get
it
subtle
and
fairly
forgettable
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
medium
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
is
slightly
disappointing
and
a
tad
watered
down
i
have
tasted
better
dunkelweizens
maybe
they
should
remove
the
heff
from
the
label
this
beer
is
truly
unique
i
have
tried
many
good
hefeweizens
in
my
day
and
this
beer
has
a
great
heff
flavor
that
hits
you
immediately
but
there
is
much
more
to
this
beer
than
this
first
flavor
lets
on
after
the
first
fairly
normal
but
good
hefeweizen
flavor
a
darker
malty
taste
starts
to
take
over
and
blend
with
the
wheatlike
heff
this
darker
tone
blends
into
the
first
flavor
in
a
very
bold
way
to
give
this
beer
a
distinct
rare
and
bold
taste
dragons
breath
is
definitely
worth
giving
a
try
i
probably
couldnt
drink
it
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
that
would
be
great
every
once
in
a
while
overall
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonationl
not
too
bad
here
overall
not
a
real
good
dark
hefeweizen
the
flavors
just
clash
rather
than
complement
o
overall
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
would
drink
again
for
sure
but
its
not
my
first
choice
taste
dark
malt
smooth
refreshing
what
but
comes
across
as
very
pedestrian
eh
its
beer
and
you
can
drink
it
i
guess
but
doesnt
do
hardly
a
thing
for
me
no
complexity
nothing
special
bland
as
can
be
sorry
all
in
all
an
interesting
take
i
feel
like
this
follows
the
typical
bayern
pattern
of
almostawesome
but
just
falling
a
bit
short
the
spice
is
a
bit
pungent
for
this
one
to
work
well
i
could
see
myself
drinking
it
again
but
not
my
favorite
dunkel
btw
its
not
really
a
dunkel
but
rather
a
dark
hefeweizen
thats
why
it
seems
a
bit
more
restrained
than
dunkels
that
really
pop
with
the
flavors
pours
a
murky
dark
brown
color
with
a
large
head
that
had
good
retention
very
little
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
the
yeast
gave
this
beer
a
spicy
note
rather
than
a
banana
bubblegum
one
a
little
bit
of
dark
wheat
bread
aroma
but
otherwise
the
smell
is
muted
the
flavor
also
is
a
bit
weak
the
yeast
does
not
add
much
to
the
flavor
almost
like
it
was
brewed
with
an
ale
yeast
some
wheaty
malt
and
a
touch
of
spice
and
that
is
about
all
that
there
is
in
the
flavor
not
bad
but
far
from
great
the
body
is
alright
but
feels
a
bit
watery
nicely
carbonated
just
a
weak
tasting
wheat
beer
in
the
end
it
drinks
alright
but
why
bother
when
there
are
far
better
ones
in
the
market
had
a
bottle
from
princetons
it
poured
a
dark
brown
with
a
short
light
tan
head
this
tasted
like
a
wheat
porter
at
first
but
then
the
malts
seemed
to
fade
away
its
not
a
bad
dunkelweizen
but
the
flavors
all
around
are
a
bit
muted
compared
to
other
examples
in
the
style
like
franziskaner
dunkel
theres
a
bit
of
dark
bread
with
spicy
phenols
its
smooth
and
drinkable
but
the
whole
character
just
isnt
there
appearance
has
a
dark
ruby
red
with
a
firm
fluffy
head
that
dissapates
slowly
leaving
nill
lace
smell
is
lightly
roasted
with
not
much
else
as
it
is
in
the
taste
as
well
also
having
grain
and
light
caramel
with
moderate
hops
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
good
carbonation
not
a
bad
dark
heff
but
could
use
a
little
more
compexity
d
easy
enough
to
drink
perhaps
not
as
stellar
as
the
german
iterations
but
no
slouch
either
dunkels
arent
all
that
common
out
west
especially
ones
that
stick
to
a
truer
lesshopped
recipe
in
that
regard
a
winner
id
enjoy
again
just
not
one
that
wins
out
over
the
germanic
originators
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
not
great
but
pretty
good
an
overall
decent
dunkel
but
a
bit
too
restrained
to
live
up
to
its
moniker
drinkability
the
flavors
are
all
present
and
accounted
for
but
overall
are
quite
muted
which
i
suppose
makes
it
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
abv
doesnt
hurt
either
compared
with
previous
dunkelweizens
i
have
enjoyed
i
thought
this
one
was
lacking
a
bit
in
terms
of
malt
and
was
overly
bitter
on
the
other
hand
i
really
enjoyed
the
smooth
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
decent
very
bland
but
not
offensive

bringing

many

my
first
review
holds
up
to
my
second
experience
with
this
brew
id
like
for
it
to
available
local
to
so
i
could
drink
it
more
regularly
perhaps
worth
a
trade
d
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
not
a
lot
going
on
so
it
makes
it
easy
going
down
and
the
low
abv
makes
it
pretty
quaffable
d
very
drinkable
good
flavor
i
definitely
want
another

best
bayern
beer
ive
had
yet
really
like
it
fairly
easy
drinking
dunkelweizen
and
not
bad
for
this
side
of
the
atlantic
i
wouldnt
mind
sessioning
this
the
smell
was
of
clove
and
the
taste
was
real
spicy
in
the
mouth
it
seemed
to
have
a
strong
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
left
the
roof
of
the
mouth
tingling
it
also
had
some
dark
fruit
in
the
finish
overall
i
am
not
well
versed
in
this
style
but
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
one
of
the
best
dunkelweizens
i
have
had
something
i
would
highly
recommend
drinkability
very
nice
job
by
bayern
i
would
buy
this
off
an
on
for
a
change
of
pace
beer
if
i
lived
back
there
huge
tan

after
the
initial
pour
that
recedes
to
a

after
a
couple
of
minutes
very
dark
brown
almost
muddy
with
a
little
cola
the
taste
has
some
nutty
roasted
malts
clove
like
yeast
and
a
pretty
dry
middle
and
fiish
none
of
these
flavors
stand
out
pretty
subtle
overall
but
still
an
ok
session
wheat
beer
the
body
is
about
the
same
as
a
hefe
with
maybe
just
a
tad
more
from
the
leftover
sweetness
the
carbonation
is
about
right
too
d
a
great
beer
but
not
according
to
bjcp
guidelines
a
bit
dark
and
overly
bready
for
the
style
a
good
beer
nonetheless
though
though
not
as
good
as
some
german
versions
of
the
style
it
is
much
more
affordable
and
tastes
pretty
decent
flavor
was
similar
to
the
aroma
nice
but
not
outstanding
fruit
malt
alcohol
tasted
a
bit
strong
for
the
abv
drinkability
ive
found
this
a
nicely
drinkable
beer
and
am
happy
to
have
a
second
each
sip
follows
the
other
naturally
and
the
flavors
are
never
so
strong
they
overwhelm
rather
subtlety
is
a
key
word
to
describe
this
beer
ill
definitely
enjoy
having
this
beer
again
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
nice
example
of
an
undervalued
style
this
beer
also
illustrates
for
me
yet
again
how
valuable
it
can
be
to
have
two
or
three
bottles
before
reviewing
this
is
definitely
a
beer
that
grows
on
one
and
i
did
not
fully
appreciate
its
subtle
complexity
until
about
the
2nd
or
3rd
bottle
drought
from
high
point
pours
deep
mahogany
with
a
medium
tanned
head
and
lovely
carbonation

aroma
of
yeast
banana
chocolate
and
cloves
medium
smooth
body
flavor
of

medium

finish
very
tasty
brew
this
beer
pours
a
very
dark
brown
to
light
black
with
a
massive
head
it
has
an
interesting
aroma
dark
roasted
grain
slightly
smokey
a
hint
of
coffee
and
a
touch
of
yeast
the
flavor
is
overwhelmingly
tangy
almost
sour
with
the
dark
roasted
flavors
left
in
the
background
to
come
through
on
the
aftertaste
after
reading
other
reviews
i
wonder
whether
i
got
an
off
bottle
no
one
else
had
the
massive
sourness
d
not
a
bad
tasting
brew
i
assume
freshness
and
carbonation
may
have
brought
my
ratings
down
have
to
try
a
new
bottle
soon
a
fairly
drinkable
dunkel
but
the
ashiness
is
a
bit
annoying
after
awhile
i
agree
that
this
is
a
very
underrated
beer
from
high
point
i
found
it
to
be
quite
delicious
and
sessionable
this
beer
was
outstanding
with
my
grilled
cheese
sandwich
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
two
at
the
liquor
store
this
brewery
does
alright
with
wheat
beers
impressive
into
a
weizen
glass
it
poured
a
chestnut
brown
with
less
than
a
finger
of
offwhite
modest
retention
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
chocolate
coffee
banana
and
clove
truly
unique
the
best
way
to
describe
the
taste
is
perfectly
balanced
between
the
aforementioned
flavors
with
a
nice
semidry
balanced
finish
and
some
malty
aftertaste
despite
the
appearance
this
is
a
thin
to
mediumbodied
beer
with
some
modest
carbonation
very
drinkable
and
quite
possibly
the
most
underrated
beer
that
this
brewery
makes
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
strong
lots
of
fruits
spices
bananas
one
of
the
better
smelling
beers
i
can
remember
taste
is
mild
compared
to
the
smell
but
good
again
banana
spices
a
bit
sweet
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fine
quality
beer
pours
a
mostly
transparent
amber
brown
color
with
a
small
screen
of
an
off
white
head
very
little
soapy
sticking
on
the
glass
roasty
wheat
some
expected
sweet
banana
and
clove
in
the
nose
a
bright
but
welcome
hop
character
hits
the
tongue
a
caramelized
sugar
like
maltwheat
sweetness
takes
over
and
rounds
out
the
sip
a
long
yeasty
aftertaste
very
easy
to
drink
and
pretty
damn
true
to
style
i
expected
a
little
more
out
of
this
one
but
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
a
a
good

of

a

seems
to

from
the
overall
experience
i
would
drink
the
beer
again

with

split
a
somewhat
dry
taste
of
dark
coffee
and
bananas
borderlining
on
that
of
a
stout
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
and
though
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
in
sessions
i
find
this
to
be
the
poor
mans
aventinus
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
flavor
makes
you
ask
why
not
exactly
bad
but
again
when
you
have
high
point
wheat
beer
co
on
the
label
my
expectations
go
up
and
once
again
i
am
disappointed
i
hope
the
highly
rated
winter
wheat
fares
better
d
so
so
this
one
stared
off
great
was
sort
of
downhill
from
there
dark
brown
beer
with
a
rapidly
fading
head
aroma
is
bananacloves
and
malts
taste
is
toasted
malts
and
cloves
overall
a
decent
beer
with
a
nice
faded
smoky
aftertaste
i
would
recommend
to
try
at
least
once
and
i
think
think
this
is
something
i
would
purchase
again
i
found
this
at
bierkraft
in
nyc
sold
as
singles
poured
into
an
andechs
weisse
glass
im
surprised
at
the
dark
color
i
thought
this
would
be
a
hefeweizen
but
ba
lists
it
as
a
dunkel
weizen
the
beer
smells
kind
of
lactosy
definitely
a
wheat
beer
but
not
as
much
phenol
as
id
prefer
same
with
the
taste
i
dont
get
much
banana
or
clove
maybe
this
is
an
old
bottle
hard
to
say
as
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
the
beer
just
not
pleasant
i
drank
the
whole
thing
but
didnt
really
enjoy
it
it
was
not
at
all
what
i
was
expecting
doesnt
taste
anything
like
a
weizen
d
drinkability
is
just
above
average
most
everything
about
this
beer
is
about
average
i
could
have
more
of
these
but
really
dont
have
a
desire
to
it
goes
down
easy
but
that
is
just
because
of
an
uneventful
smell
and
flavor
overall
not
bad
not
really
that
good
either
i
had
no
other
choice
but
to
pour
it
into
a
weizen
glass
what
came
out
of
the
bottle
was
a
mahagony
brown
colored
beer
that
had
some
black
cherry
highlights
it
had
a
beautiful
massive
beige
colored
head
of
foam
not
only
was
it
beautiful
but
it
had
excellent
retention
that
left
behind
a
small
beige
film
and
streak
after
streak
of
beige
lace
it
had
a
light
dark
aroma
of
toasted
malts
a
few
cloves
a
quick
splash
of
lemon
subtle
sweet
caramel
bread
and
then
it
ended
with
a
touch
of
ripe
banana
the
taste
started
off
mild
with
toasted
malts
and
a
hint
of
caramel
but
then
after
that
it
went
sour
and
tart
with
lemon
grapefruit
and
citrus
hops
of
course
the
mouthfeel
was
light
but
this
dunkelweizen
has
an
a
lightly
sour
aftertaste
of
grapefruit
and
lemons
in
the
end
its
clearly
not
a
great
dunkelweizen
but
it
is
a
nice
little
take
on
a
german
stlye
from
a
great
nj
brwery
dvery
interesting
beer
not
on
par
with
the
germans
but
a
very
good
shot
from
an
american
brewery
and
one
that
ends
up
being
unique
at
that
pours
a
very
dark
burgundycola
color
with
a
tan
head
nice
dunkel
wheat
very
dark
color
sweet
raisins
syrup
and
dried
fruit
on
nose
some
alcohol
on
nose
as
well
flavor
is
very
rich
and
full
of
fresh
plums
sweet
raisins
and
bread
drinks
more
like
a
strong
belgian
or
wheat
bock
starts
out
very
sweet
from
the
syrupy
sweet
raisin
and
dried
fruit
hints
and
finishes
with
some
dry
burgundy
notes
theres
a
slight
woody
character
to
the
wine
like
palate
as
well
good
drinkability
very
smooth
palate
with
some
alcohol
detection
a
solid
good
beer
this
is
a
pretty
cool
oldschool
wheat
beer
and
not
your
average
dunkel
its
very
aromatic
and
has
any
earthy
feel
that
backed
my
spiced
cocoa
and
roasted
grains
almost
like
a
brown
ale
or
porter
the
mouthfeel
is
a
nice
mellow
balance
of
sweet
malts
which
makes
for
a
very
drinkable
beer
thats
also
out
of
the
norm
the
only
similar
beer
i
can
think
of
is
the
michigan
brewing
bavarian
dark
for
the
same
dark
earthy
tone
really
wasnt
too
impressed
although
a
decent
beer
for
a
company
that
claims
to
specialize
in
wheat
beers
they
couldve
done
alot
better
with
this
one
this
tastes
looks
and
smells
more
like
a
stout
than
a
wheat
beer
and
after
spending
7
75
on
a
sixpack
i
was
kind
of
dissapointed
by
the
overall
lack
of
complexity
and
bland
flavor
that
predominated
this
brew
im
pissed
i
wasted
almost
eight
bucks
on
a
brew
that
i
basically
had
to
force
down
rather
than
enjoy
no
real
wheat
flavor
in
here
but
more
traces
of
cocoa
and
bittersweet
chocolate
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
dunkel
session
worthy
as
well
pours
a
nice

dark

a

for

cheers
overall
i
felt
this
was
pretty
average
for
the
style
certainly
a
good
drink
but
nothing
spectacular
poured
a
moderately
cloudy
dark
red
colour
with
a
12
inch
layer
of
sand
coloured
foam
that
faded
away
in
about
25
seconds
leaving
a
ring
of
frost
about
its
edges
smell
was
very
nice
consisting
of
roasted
wheat
kernels
and
chewy
caramel
candy
quite
nice
taste
was
average
having
the
proper
flavour
profiles
for
the
style
but
finishing
up
with
a
surprising
bitterness
it
wasnt
offensive
at
all
in
fact
it
was
very
mild
its
just
that
i
wasnt
expecting
any
bitterness
from
a
brew
of
this
sort
so
far
i
like
ramsteins
winter
wheat
the
best
this
is
however
decent
at
least
deep
chestnut
colour
topped
by
a
short
light
brown
head
fizzy
bubbles
that
dissipate
quickly
and
leave
a
bit
of
lace
behind
malty
aroma
composed
of
toasty
lightly
chocolate
grains
and
a
mild
yeasty
bite
sweet
malty
flavour
that
you
get
out
of
some
better
german
beers
mild
breadiness
with
a
light
fruit
character
as
well
it
finishes
with
a
dry
cocoa
flavour
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
a
little
on
the
low
side
not
bad
nothing
spectacular
though
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
didnt
make
a
huge
impression
on
me
overall
a
nice
american
rendition
of
the
dunkel
weizen
not
bad
but
could
use
more
yeast
to
give
it
more
body
it
also
could
use
more
depth
and
character
and
fit
the
style
better
worth
trying
anyway
they
should
also
write
dunkel
or
dark
on
the
label
and
almost
like
a
stout
it
has
a
slight
wheat
twang
as
i
like
to
call
it
this
is
a
great
change
for
a
summer
brew
for
those
who
want
a
bit
more
kick
and
flavor
in
their
session
beers
i
really
wish
that
high

offerings
were
more

in
my

nj
should
be
proud
had
many
samples
of
this
at
the
hight

brewery
in
butler
nj
first
thing
you
notice
about
this
beer
is
the
chocolate
aroma
and
taste
then
the
apple
clove
taste
hits
followed
by
a
nutty
yeast
flavor
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
is
that
is
like
drinking
apple
pie
that
was
covered
in
chocolate
sauce
except
that
it
is
not
as
sweet
the
best
dunkle
weizen
i
have
ever
had
a
little
bit
of
germany
in
central
jersey
roasted
malt
again
comes
to
the
forefront
on
the
palate
overly
fizzy
and
aggressive
carbonation
holds
this
back
from
being
great
otherwise
this
is
a
very
good
dunkelweizen
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
if
it
wasnt
so
bubbly
id
dare
say
its
one
of
the
best
domestic
dunkels
out
there
ive
had
the
maibock
from
ramstein
as
well
and
i
would
try
this
and
other
offerings
if
i
get
the
chance
o
overall
its
tasty
and
doesnt
have
any
distinct
flaws
yet
it
lacks
typicity
and
a
sense
of
direction
on
the
palate
i
get
more
bananas
dark
malts
some
light
smokyness
and
drying
hops
long
and
tasty
finish
flavorful
quality
creation
from
ramstein
they
put
out
high
quality
brews
and
this
one
is
no
different
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
this
is
my
third
dunkel
of
the
evening
and
it
is
the
best
i
have
had
a
good
experience
in
the
past
with
highpoint
on
tap
the
look
and
smell
is
point
on
for
the
style
and
and
it
is
comparable
to
many
of
the
best
in
class
a
good
brewer
of
germanic
styles
highpoint
is
a
respectable
entrant
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
necessarily
but
its
a
bad
dunkelweizen
label
this
a
schwartzbier
or
something
and
i
mightve
graded
this
higher
needs
less
roasted
malt
and
more
wheat
good
yeast
strain
though
that
being
said
the
alcohol
is
light
enough
that
one
could
enjoy
a
few
of
these
in
a
session
and
not
feel
overwhelmed
the
other
high
point
beers
keep
this
beers
profile
and
offer
more
but
this
isnt
a
disappointment
by
any
stretch
a
bit
more
caramel
stickness
and
dark
spice
could
have
made
this
great
but
this
stands
just
fine
as
is
interesting

definitely
have

overly

which
is
off
putting
would
not
buy
this
beer
again
not
my

but
i
would
encourage
everyone
to
try
it
o
this
beer
was
quite

yeasty
and
felt

it
could
have
had

a

i
have
had
this
beer
twice
now
and
in
both
cases
there
were
flaws
though
not
the
same
flaws
this
review
is
a
composite
of
both
tastes
but
doesnt
really
capture
either
as
the

didnt

roasted
notes
underneath
nice
spritzy
and
enjoyable
mouthfeel
an
initial
smoothness
rides
together
with
a
crisp
nip
up
front
its
pretty
thin
though
not
heinously
so
theres
enough
going
on
that
its
interesting
but
not
particularly
so
o
overall
this
was
an
alright
beer
but
not
spectacular
with
these
imports
it
can
be
hit
or
miss
and
is
never
a
really
good
judgement
of
what
the
beer
really
tastes
like
i
probably
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
again
d

not
a
bad
brew
by
any
means
but
not
all
that
exciting
either
im
a
fan
of
dark
wheats
so
i
had
my
hopes
up
for
this
one
it
has
some
good
things
going
on
but
isnt
very
complex
its
light
and
would
be
easy
enough
to
drink
a
few
though
i
dont
see
myself
wanting
more
than
the
big
single
all
in
all
a
very
drinkable
quality
experience
the
brew
is
quite
mirky
looking
and
the
lacing
peels
right
down
the
glass
does
not
stick
tasting
it
clean
and
even
malty
mouthfeel
flavors

and
nuts

scrumptious

a

in

a

a
fairly
thick
pale

that

a
strong
overtone
of

apple

a

of

flavor
is
malty
and
a
little
fruity
not
very
well
rounded
but
still
acceptable
texture
is
quite
fizzy
just
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
it
leaves
behind
a
decent

a
while

it
to
calm
down
not
a
good
sign
when
i
can
actually
now
see
the
beer
its
a
redish
amber
colur
head
is
large
and
thickly
frothy
aroma
is
actually
ok
bready
spicy
yeastssome
barnyard
and
orange
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
kinda
ends
very
abruptly
though
ok
on
the
palate
i
actually
liked
the
carbonation
very
refeshing
overall
not
great
but
certainlly
not
bad
a
touch
unique
for
the
style
and
i
really
liked
it
would
not
mind
doing
this
one
again
any
day
it
has
a
nice
vanilla
taste
to
it
im
getting
a
little
bit
of
banana
as
well
lite
toasted
malts
little
to
no
hop
taste
it
is
very
pleasant
to
drink
pours
a
shade
of
brown
with
an
offwhite
head
of
about
1that
slowly
dissipates
smells
maltywheaty
and
a
little
of
clove
taste
was
pretty
easy
going
but
likeable
a
slightly
more
potent
taste
wouldnt
be
a
terrible
thing
has
a
fairly
typical
dunkel
taste
just
a
little
light
as
others
mentioned
it
had
a
sort
of
tobacco
aftertaste
which
really
intrigued
me
it
is
certainly
different
from
other
dunkels
i
have
tasted
mouthfeel
is
light
with
light
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
intriguing
take
on
the
dunkel
style
but
it
could
use
a
little
more
in
the
flavor
department
d
very
drinkable
well
crafted
and
it
seems
effortless
in
its
delivery
not
something
that
is
a
wow
but
something
that
is
enjoyable
and
solidly
made
sinkability
i
really
enjoyed
their
helles
lager
but
this
completely
missed
the
mark
notes
the
mouthfeel
changes
noticeably
if
the
yeast
pellet
is
agitated
while
some
may
find
the
tobaccoy
after
taste
offputting
i
enjoyed
it
as
the
memory
of
a
good
cigar
and
luckily
the
flavor
doesnt
last
that
long
this
is
probably
one
of
my
favorite
beers
even
if
it
has
a
milder
body
than
the
classification
would
suggest
the
simple
complexity
is
nice
pours
a
dark
red
amber
so
much
rocky
head
its
almost
unbelievable
huge
amounts
of
lacing
and
decent
carbonation
only
faint
aromas
though
some
mint
a
hint
of
lavendar
tiny
bit
of
vanilla
not
much
else
maybe
a
tiny
bit
of
bubblegum
in
there
unique
so
far
weird
flavor
very
thin
unfortunately
theres
some
of
the
aforementioned
bubblegum
notes
in
there
very
easy
drinking
too
easydrinking
if
you
ask
me
no
big
hop
or
malt
characteristics
at
all
kind
of
like
a
lite
dark
beer
i
dont
like
this
but
you
could
probably
session
it
all
day
as
its
mostly
water
dont
bother
with
this
folks
even
though
its
relatively
cheap
you
get
what
you
pay
for
d
the
fizz
really
oppresses
the
flavors
and
there
isnt
much
depth
to
it
but
it
does
have
some
of
the
classic
hefe
characters
underneath
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
huge
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
lot
of
toffee
and
caramel
malts
with
some
wheat
orange
and
earthy
hops
characteristics
the
flavor
is
wheat
with
a
lot
of
toffee
i
also
get
some
citrus
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
sharp
effervescence
medium
heavy
body
slightly
warming
a
very
good
beer
indeed
once
the
head
drops
if
a
fresher
sample
tastes
better
than
this
one
would
be
a
nice
drinkable
beer
only
5
abv
and
no
rough
edges
to
the
flavor
profile
pouring
this
into
a
glass
i
thought
i
had
grabbed
a
coke
by
mistake
body
looks
like
a
hazy
cola
and
the
head
is
very
fizzy
definitely
get
your
standard
banana
and
clove
off
the
nose
along
with
faint
nutmeg
and
bread
undertones
lots
of
banana
and
hearty
spice
qualities
on
the
palate
with
a
faint
caramel
and
light
tartness
up
front
the
fizz
of
the
carbonation
is
pretty
overwhelming
here
and
settles
down
to
a
very
slight
body
overall
this
one
lacks
the
depth
of
flavors
that
is
somewhat
common
to
the
style
accompanied
by
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
d
very
cleanly
made
beer
with
no
flaws
but
also
very
little
flavor
yhere
just
is
not
much
going
on
the
big
flaw
is
the
fizzy
carbonation
that
gets
in
the
way
of
the
delicate
flavors
not
bad
but
certainly
uninspiring
and
ive
had
better
examples
of
the
style
i
assume
it
would
taste
better
on
tap
as
mentioned
id
had
its
sister
beer
the
weissbier
and
have
to
say
i
much
preferred
that
one
this
schwarze
weisse
just
didnt
cut
it
drinkability
even
though
i
rated
this
brew
as
average
i
dont
think
i
want
to
drink
a
second
sample
md
mouthfeel
is
on
the
thin
side
a
bit
watery
the
drinkability
is
about
average
not
the
best
but
not
at
all
hard
to
get
down
pours
a
cloudy
medium
brown
with
lots
of
haze
visible
as
i
hold
the
glass
near
a
light
very
little
head
that
dissapears
quickly
the
beer
tastes
slightly
of
wheat
malt
with
some
caramel
like
character
the
flavor
is
very
straight
forward
just
malted
wheat
with
very
little
hop
presence
or
any
other
flavors
im
also
not
sure
why
moosbacher
gets
such
low
ratings
on
this
website
both
the
offerings
ive
had
from
them
were
tasty
and
at
a
good
price
for
german
imports
flavor
is
a
little
better
after
it
sits
for
a
little
while
papery
and
oxidized
somewhat
thin
and
bland
something
vaguely
like
apple
cider
and
nutmeg
aftertaste
is
dull
and
flaccid
the
hollowness
makes
me
think
its
past
its
prime
though
the
label
says
it
has
6
months
on
it
the
body
is
ok
it
feels
like
a
weizen
just
without
any
flavor
slowly
working
on
finishing
this
but
wouldnt
drink
it
again
beer
has
a
slight
harshness
to
it
there
is
a
flavor
of
roast
there
subtle
there
isnt
much
bitterness
this
beer
is
wet
not
dry
interesting
but
not
my
favorite
dunkel
not
by
a
long
shot
drinkability
is
moderate
but
its
still
sessionable
i
dont
think
i
would
order
it
again
but
it
may
be
an
important
stop
on
the
dunkelweiss
journey
i
think
they
are
on
to
something
with
this
beer
but
it
is
the
characteristics
of
the
brewery
to
undermalt
their
beers
though
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
the
lack
of
meaningful
maltiness
leaves
the
beer
wonderless
definitely
more
so
in
the
dunkel
weisse
vein
than
a
new
style
called
a
schwarze
weisse
no
where
near
black
in
appearance
a
slightly
clouded
amber
chestnut
brown
with
a
bright
white
head
forming
thick
with
soft
carbonation
rolling
with
tightly
packed
bubbles
lacing
fares
well
and
sticks
on
the
edges
of
the
glass
in
sporadic
patterns
aroma
has
a
slight
nutty
tobacco
herbal
quality
with
fruity
banan
bread
notes
as
well
slightly
spicy
with
clove
and
some
extra
estery
goodness
follows
flavor
wise
this
one
deals
slightly
sour
tart
edge
with
the
banana
and
clove
mild
roasty
and
nutty
finish
a
pretty
nice
mix
and
definitely
easy
drinkin
version
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
especially
for
a
darker
weisse
beer
but
carbonation
is
soft
and
delicate
yet
carries
the
beer
extremely
well
drinkability
overall
is
pretty
effortless
and
carefree
the
only
thing
slowing
down
my
consumption
of
this
version
of
the
style
would
be
the
price
per
bottle
compared
to
buying
a
case
of
franzy
or
paulaner
examples
solid
and
refreshing
beer
that
im
sure
ill
try
out
again
in
the
future

the

the

simmers
quickly
and
what

by
look

to
be
a
strong
thirstquenching
palate
pleasure
turns
out
only
half
right
smooth
and
easy
drinking
yes
but
the
weight
that
would
be
the
dunkel
seems
to
have
been
misplaced
drinkability
it
is
lighter
and
easier
to
drink
this
beer
goes
down
easily
but
seems
to
stay
on
the
lighter
side

carbonation

the
beer
is

with
no

booze
presence
a
solid
beer
that
is
at

enjoyable
but
not
excellent
the
taste
is
quite
light
there
is
a
dark
sweet
lagery
wheatiness
to
the
beer
this
is
well
carbonated
with
plenty
of
yeastiness
that
keeps
this
to
more
of

of

sweet
caramels
sweet

some
slightly
off
mustiness
in
there
as
well
there
is

underneath
the

it
is
an
okay
beer
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
overall
bland
and
uninspired

very

i
would
skip
this

d
im

carefully
for

is

to

like
its

i
could
drink
this
all

as
its
light
and
flavorful
overall
not
too
impressed
but
its
drinkable
drinkable
a
bit
bitterish
for
style
which
would
be
fine
but
the
expected
malt
character
seems
restrained
for
a
dunkel
allinall
it
becomes
less
impressive
down
the
line
but
in
the
end
is
still
a
nice
dunkelweisse
dont
really
get
the
schwarze
part
they
should
call
it
dunkelweisse
as
thats
what
it
is
dark
but
not
black
anyway
certainly
worth
trying
ps
as
this
beer
warms
some
more
flavor
develops
however
you
lose
the
refreshing
aspect
that
is
its
best
feature
in
my
opinion
overall
pretty
good
very
good
expensive
but
i
am
really
glad
i

beer
this
one
had

going
for

in

beginning
poured
up
medium
to
dark
brown
and
somewhat
cloudy
resembling
some
nasty
rusty
rain
water
poured
from
an
old
pipe
precisley
what
i
look
for
in
this
style
the
smell
was
rather
spicy
and
in
a
roundabout
way
kind
of
reminded
me
of
banana
bread
dough
with
more
spice
and
less
banana
so
far
so
good
i
take
a
sip
and
everything
comes
to
a
woefully
abrupt
stop
there
is
a
very
noticeable
sourness
in
the
flavour
of
this
one
that
is
more
akin
to
a
farmhouse
spontaneously
firmented
thing
than
a
weisse
bier
i
dont
mind
sournes
in
beer
solong
as
its
supposed
to
be
there
i
have
never
encountered
this
characteristic
in
this
style
ever
and
it
was
very
offputting
for
lack
of
a
better
word
id
give
the
flavour
average
at
best
mouthfeel
was
about
what
was
to
be
expected
drinkability
would
be
great
but
that
sourness
just
really
distracts
me
i
love
this
style
but
i
cant
do
this
one
perhaps
i
got
a
bad
beer
overall
this
was
drinkable
but
im
not
really
excited
about
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
brown
color
with
a
thick
frothy
offwhite
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
fruity
banana
clove
scent
along
with
a
light
wheat
crystal
and
pale
malt
aroma
its
very
dry
with
a
slight
crystal
malt
sweetness
the
taste
is
average
it
has
an
extremely
dry
wheat
malt
flavor
with
just
a
touch
of
fruity
yeast
esters
its
quite
earthy
with
little
crystal
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
average
also
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
an
average
dunkel
its
looks
great
but
its
not
very
interesting
ive
never
had
this
one
figured
id
give
it
a
shot

says
it

i
like
this
beer
def
a

i
will
always
judge
dunkelweizens
to
the
perfect

had
in

outside

were

could
easily
drink
more
but
wont
make
a
big
effort
to
get
it
again
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
its
a
nice
cooler
weather
alternative
to
the
hefes
i
enjoy
during
the
summer
months
hrmmmm
quite
an
interesting
beer
here
its
not
amazing
but
quite
good
considering
the
cost
i
think
there
are
much
better
and
cheaper
alternatives
but
the
benchmark
for
this
category
in
my
book
is
franziskaner
d
a
little
inconsistent
fizzy
and
metallic
at
first

improving

thick
off

head
from

liter

the
aroma
strikes
me
as
being
sweet
and
yeasty
there
is
an
almost
metallic
flavor
at
first
some
nutty
flavors
banana
is
noticeable
but
clove
really
isnt
to
me
i
would
like
a
thicker
mouthfeel
worth
a
try
unpleasant
astringent
mouthfeel
leads
off
this
sickly
sweet
mess
of
a
beer
this
is
a
year
past
its
prime
and
i
hope
that
explains
the
flavors
that
require
me
to
rinse
my
mouth
after
sipping
this
atrocity
from
the
ceramiclidded
swing
top
bottle
consumed
right
after
the
weiss
this
poured
with
a
lesspronounced
head
looking
more
like
a
regular
dunkel
bier
than
dunkelweiss
the
aroma
too
is
much
more
malty
than
yeasty
with
a
big
sweet
cookieness
to
it
likewise
the
flavor
was
like
a
sweet
girl
scout
treat
very
sugary
light
and
slippery
this
was
closer
to
a
homebrewed
soda
than
a

not

id
probably
head
out

again
i
like
this
beer
because
it
captures
all
that
is
good
about

i
would

they
make

this

i
wanted
to
throw
this
in
to
contribute
to
the
rating
of
this

will

next

moosbacher

isnt

yeah
they
taste
different
due

the
different
styles
but
in
terms
of
quality
theyre
two
peas
in
a
pod
or
if
you
prefer
the

is
a

a

sitting

as
a

this
misses
by
a
mile
i
dont
think
it
even
uses
a

a

this
is
good
beer
it
has
far
too
much

seems
to
finish
thin
with
a
light
sourness
an
ok
dark
malty
beer
but
not
really
meeting
the
dunkelweizen
style
and
a
bit
odd
for
that
this
is
the
second
leavenworth
wheat
style
ale
that
seemed
to
be
more
of
a
traditionally
malted
style
than
a
weizen
odd
ok
but
better
choices
if
youre
looking
for
a
dunkelweizen
pours
an
appealing
dark
brown
to
black
with
a
quickly
dissipated
head
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
like
most
wheat
beers
flavor
is
lacking
for
a
dunkel
the
malty
taste
overpowers
the
effervescent
nature
of
a
wheat
not
bad
but
not
great
and
im
only
reviewing
this
based
on
1
beer
picked
up
at
total
wine
from
the
warm
shelf
i
did
not
finish
this
one
its
not
out
of
the
question
that
i
had
a
bad
bottle
though
you
never
know
how
long
something
is
sitting
around
there
was
no
bottling
or
bestby
date
on
the
bottle
that
i
could
find
pours
a
sexy
dark
brown
with
a
size
able
off
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
nutty
aroma
of
roasted
malt
wheat
and
hops
in
the
taste
roasted
malts
tangy
lemony
wheat
and
a
firm
bitterness
good
roast
but
odd
sourness
and
misplaced
hops
i
think
this
one
needs
some
cleaning
up
12
ounce
bottle
into
weizen

no

dating
pours
hazy
reddish
brown
color
with
a
nice

reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
nice

down

a
good

it
does
feel
a

on
the
watery
side

nice
roasted

with
decent
balance
of
fruitiness
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
enjoyed
this
overall
a
drinkable
dunkel
but
probably
not
a
great
one
overall
this
is
a
decent
dunkelweizen
but
i
think
it
could
be
improved
if
the
clove
and
banana
flavors
came
through
more
in
the
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
dark
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
a
touch
of
yeast
detected
taste
is
also
somewhat
mild
some
banana
a
bit
more
hops
than
usual
for
this
style
some
mild
spice
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
decent
but
mild
for
the
style
overall
the
beer
is
not
flawed
but
is
not
really
memorable
either
a
little
more
yeast
centric
flavors
could
make
it
more
interesting
i
could
describe
the
beer
as
a
filtered
dunkelweizen
makes
the
overall
experience
not
bad
but
dull
a
hard
sell
at
18
a
6er
here
in
alberta
i
doubt
id
try
this
one
again
with
all
the
other
options
available
too
me
bruised
banana
logo
would
have
been
more
appropriate
pours
a
hazy
brown
with
smallish
head
nose
is
a
big
fat
bruised
banana
palate
offers
a
nice
mix
of
brownbready
flavors
and
esters
from
the
nice
yeast
along
with
more
bruised
banana
mediumlight
bodied
easy
drinking
not
bad
for
an
american
attempt
at
the
style
starts
out
with
a
great
head
doesnt
retain
it
as
well
as
it
might
actually
a
little
darker
and
hazier
than
i
had
expected
from
a
dunkelweizen
i
know
it
needs
to
be
dark
and
wheat
is
gonna
mean
some
haze
but
ive
seen
beers
in
this
style
look
a
lot
more
inviting
still
something
i
can
look
at
and
think
yeah
ill
drink
that
little
bit
of
malt
and
hops
on
the
nose
no
bananas
or
cloves
or
any
fruitiness
to
speak
of
really
taste
leans
pretty
strongly
toward
sweetness
not
real
balanced
but
not
undrinkably
sweet
or
anything
slight
bit
of
roast
from
the
dark
malts
no
mistaking
the
wheat
in
the
malt
bill
but
much
like
the
aroma
nothing
really
going
on
in
the
taste
that
jumps
up
and
says
good
ol
dunkelweizen
the
mouthfeel
on
this
reminds
me
of
just
about
every
beginner
homebrew
with
wheat
extract
undercarbonated
and
thin
altogether
not
really
the
beer
for
me
ill
stick
with
the
import
classics
where
this
style
is
concerned
unless
i
get
wind
of
any
musthave
usa
iterations
that
being
said
the
beer
is
not
so
much
bad
as
it
is
not
good
remember
how
much
worse
it
could
be
below
average
yes
undrinkable
terrible
should
be
forcibly
removed
from
the
market
not
in
my
opinion
is
it
even
a
dunkelweizen
i
dunno
about
all
that
malty
aroma
has
a
subtle
fruity
underpinning
and
a
hint
of
cloves
it
pours
a
dark
rather
hazy
mahogany
with
a
decent
finebubbled
light
tan
head
that
leaves
some
good
lacing
flavor
has
a
malty
core
and
fruity
caramel
and
nutty
notes
smooth
texture
has
average
body
but
a
good
amount
of
fizz
if
you
like
session
beers
look
no
further
as
a
sixpack
of
this
could
easily
be
enjoyed
in
a
few
sittings
this
wasnt
bad
so
much
as
it
was
just
eh
no
banana
not
much
of
a
body
and
lack
of
carbonation
and
head
all
combine
to
make
this
unmemorable
but
for
anyone
who
wants
a
lowcost
version
of
this
style
thats
accessible
by
nearly
all
this
would
be
a
sufficient
choice
overall
nothing
stuck
out
at
me
with
this
beer
which
im
not
even
sure
could
be
considered
a
dunkelweizen
popured
a
light
brown
with
onefinger
head
that
sticks
around
glass
on
top
of
a
rather
mild
almost
airy
sweet
malt
aroma
although
there
are
citric
hefe
notes
as
well
light
body
the
lgiht
citrichefe
characters
are
there
although
no
spice
or
wheat
twang
is
really
prevelant
and
there
is
very
minimal
sweetness
like
touches
of
toffee
more
than
caramel
or
chocolate
nice
blend
and
balance
so
i
dont
mind
sipping
on
it
and
theres
touch
of
fruits
and
a
dry
malt
base
in
the
finish
but
overall
its
just
too
bland
to
be
anything
other
than
a
halfdecent
beer
pretty
good
beer
nothing
crazy
outrageous
something
i
could
drink
all
night
d
okay
but
not
a
good
representation
of
a
dark
wheat
easy
to
drink
though
so
it
might
be
a
good
gateway
brew
for
someone
o
this
beer
recipe
needs
to
be
reexamined
and
given
some
tlc
because
it
damages
the
rep
of
fish
brewing
and
leavenworth
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
i
havnt
had
much
of
this
style
in
a
while
and
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
back
into
them
overall
like
the
leavenworth
whistling
pig
i
tried
the
other
day
this
beer
is
kind
of
a
flop
i
fear
its
time
to
just
clear
the
word
dunkelweizen
right
off
the
label
guys
black
ipas
are
all
the
rage
so
lets
call
this
a
black
american
pale
wheat
ale
feel
free
to
shoehorn
alpinestyle
in
there
somewhere
too
o
this
beer
is
better
than
advertised
its
very
drinkable
and
has
a
nice
flow
of
flavors
as
it
is
enjoyed
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
a
deeper
chesnut
brown
with
thicker
but
quick
to
fade
off
white
head
atop
aromas
were
very
light
with
some
minimal
clove
being
the
main
componenta
passing
toasty
wheat
note
comes
thru
as
well
alot
like
the
aromas
the
flavors
are
minimallight
clove
and
again
the
toasted
wheat
very
average
beer
for
the
stylenot
horrible
but
lacking
any
real
punch
of
flavor
overall
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
but
not
terribly
complex
either
fun
for
drinking
but
not
for
thinking
an
ok
summer
drink
and
worthy
of
a
session
or
twobut
not
as
a
dunkel
overall
this
is
a
good
dunkelweizen
not
spectacular
but
it
has
pretty
good
flavor
seems
fresh
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
mo
very
crisp
and
refreshing
but
the
beer
lacks
a
lot
of
the
classic
dark
wheat
qualities
the
spiciness
is
nice
but
overall
this
beer
lacks
a
lot
of
character
i
wouldnt
call
it
a
dunkelweizen
maybe
an
american
amber
flavored
with
some
wheat
its
not
actually
bad
and
as
a
quaff
its
acceptable
all
in
all
drinkable
but
not
earthshattering
which
is
how
i
feel
most
of
leavenworths
stuff
has
turned
out
id
drink
it
again
if
it
was
on
sale
but
kind
of
unmemorable
and
there
are
a
lot
of
better
dunkelweizens
out
there
the
beeer
is
mediumbodied
and
effervescent
it
certainly
doesnt
seem
like
a
poor
effort
in
this
respect
a
decent
mouthfeel
does
not
alone
a
good
beer
make
however
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
beer
is
a
complete
waste
of
time
and
money
avoid
at
all
costs
in
this
bottle
lies
nothing
but
shame
d
very
drinkable
again
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
and
would
be
happy
to
recommend
to
others
pours
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
tan
head
of
moderate
height
head
dissipated
quickly
but
left
a
little
lacing
smell
is
of
roasted
malt
and
some
caramel
taste
is
mostly
of
roasted
malt
and
a
little
of
hops
no
wheat
taste
at
all
mouthfeelnus
a
little
watery
carbonation
is
fine
i
was
pretty
dissapointed
with
this
beer
its
not
really
a
dunkelweizen
if
there
is
no
wheat
it
would
be
ab
okay
beer
if
they
would
rename
it
not
much
to
bring
me
back
to
it
id
drink
it
again
if
offered
but
it
isnt
something
id
probably
buy
again
overall
id
say
this
is
decent
but
not
exceptional
or
outstanding
doesnt
seem
much
like
a
dunkelweizen
at
all
its
certainly
easy
to
drink
if
this
were
sold
as
a
dunkel
lager
id
give
it
better
marks
hmmm
a
mild
in
alcohol
and
flavour
both
dunkelweizen
with
the

of
a

hop

interesting
i
suppose
and
it
has
enough
basic
elements
to
not
write
off
entirely
i
wouldnt
refuse
this
if
offered
as
its
well
made
and
plainly
drinkable
d
nowhere
near
what
a
good
dunkelweisse
should
be
no
yeast
esters
and
frankly
not
a
real
good

appearance
pours
a
dark
amber
with
minimal
head
and
lace
smell
of
grainy
sweet
malty
caramel
taste
has
a
sweet
smokey
maltiness
with
light
hops
and
a
note
of
chocolate
and
coffee
mouthfeel
is
light
fair
bodied
but
almost
watered
down
with
good
carbonation
not
bad
of
a
brew
but
could
use
a
bit
more
balance
not
a
bad
beer
but
definitely
missing
some
key
elements
for
a
dunkelweizen
or
a
memorable
beer
for
that
matter
not
worth
the
hefty
import
pricetag
here
in
alberta
pours
a
murky
bog
of
brown
with
a
light
frothy
head
smells
of
malts
and
wheat
stretch
out
to
grab
the
nose
but
they
do
not
overstay
their
welcomes
those
malts
and
wheat
return
when
the
tongue
gets
involved
with
the
wheat
appropriately
making
up
the
majority
of
the
flavor
profile
not
too
much
complexity
though
a
very
faint
hint
of
smoke
signal
can
be
detected
somewhere
in
the
wheaty
static
lighter
than
most
dunkels
that
ive
had
the
taste
doesnt
hang
around
too
long
but
that
does
make
for
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
drinkability
is
high
this
is
a
tasty
nice
fall
flavor
without
being
to
sweet
and
cloying
highly
quaffable
in
the
final
reckoning
boulder
bend
dunkelweizen
alpinestyle
dark
wheat
ale
is
no
better
than
whistling
pig
alpinestyle
wheat
ale
maybe
if
fish
put
as
much
effort
into
brewing
as
they
do
into
naming
these
leavenworth
biers
would
at
least
be
decent
the
body
is
good
light
and
full
with
out
being
sticky
drinkability
is
very
good
a
great
beer
for
these
last
few
days
of
summer
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
and
perhaps
worth
some
effort
to
seek
out
taste
is
of
some
wheat
some
chocolate
in
the
back
sour
malt
and
roastiness
ends
a
little
dry
drinkability
im
glad
i
got
to
be
the
second
reviewer
of
this
beer
unfortunately
this
really
isnt
anything
to
go
crazy
about
its
a
very
average
beer
making
the
marks
of
the
style
just
barely
the
brewers
played
it
really
safe
with
this
brew
no
experimentation
just
a
basic
american
wheat
beer
with
darker
coloring
and
roasted
malt
i
really
appreciate
smaller
brewers
but
in
order
to
compete
some
of
these
guys
really
need
to
step
up
there
game
not
bad
stuff
just
not
very
good
either
what
a
find
i
have
made
bonfire
dunkle
weiss
is
ok
i
am
just
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
style
so
ratings
from
me
are
probably
skewed
this
was
a
retro
release
from
two
bros
the
beer
was
dark
almost
opaque
with
browruby
hugh
there
is
a
almost
nonexistent
head
that
is
not
lacing
there
is
a
light
wheatly
smell
and
a
sweet
mlt
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
bland
carbonation
overall
eh
do
drinkability
is
good
with
the
manageable
abv
and
the
good
tastes
overall
this
is
a
fine
dunkelweizen
4
0
overall
this
is
a
dunkelweizen
worth
your
time
it
was
perfect
on
draught
and
i
can
say
that
it
is
a
testament
to
a
great
brewery
the
feel
is
crisp
and
light
but
smooth
as
well
a
good
dunkelweizen
will
dispel
the
darker
is
heavier
notion
held
by
those
who
dont
know
better
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
creamcolored
head
smells
of
light
roasted
malt
and
a
bit
of
clove
opens
with
a
mild
chocolately
flavor
mixed
with
light
tones
of
clove
and
banana
and
a
bit
of
bread
finishes
smooth
with
light
chocolate
roasted
malt
flavors
very
light
bodied
a
decent
brew
however
the
flavors
never
really
come
through
and
were
never
as
upfront
as
i
would
have
liked
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
midlevel
carbonation
thats
enough
to
foam
this
up
slightly
on
the
palate
without
creating
any
prickly
sensation
the
resulting
mouthfeel
is
smooth
flowing
and
wellsuited
to
the
beer
it
sits
around
on
the
palate
long
enough
to
pick
up
the
flavors
as
necessary
closes
out
semidry
with
a
bit
of
stickiness
around
the
edges
of
the
mouth
overall
decent
hefeweizen
but
needs
more
yeast
to
balance
the
roast
the
malty
dunklebannanamaltsweetness
comes
through
more
in
the
smell
than
the
taste
taste
is
a
bit
drier
and
hoppier
with
a
chocolaty
finish
with
less
complexity
than
others
of
this
style
it
is
good
not
great
and
for
6bommer
it
was
solid
value
kinda
going
out
of
order
in
this
anniversary
series

but
whos
counting
this
stuff
pours
a
dark
somewhat
hazy
russetruby
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
offtan
foam
the
nose
comprises
clove
dark
wheat
light
banana
a
pinch
of
black
pepper
and
a
halfpinch
of
cinnamon
the
taste
comes
through
with
a
blast
of
spice
cinnamon
clove
brown
sugar
allspice
and
black
pepper
some
mild
dark
wheat
and
banana
notes
populate
the
background
but
theyre
clearly
relegated
to
the
supporting
cast
theyre
petitioning
for
more
than
their
couple
o
lines
apiece
but
the
director
seems
to
be
a
bit
of
an
ass
something
akin
to
mild
tea
sits
amongst
the
scenery
behind
everything
else
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
very
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
watery
feel
overall
a
muddled
weak
take
on
the
dunkelweizen
style
not
my
thing
yo
o
the
beer
seems
to
be
over
carbonated
and
takes
a
delicate
hand
to
pour
this
and
get
more
beer
than
bubbles
in
your
glass
the
beer
is
interesting
but
doesnt
seem
to
fit
the
style
o
the
bottle
describes
this
as
a
darker
more
chocolaty
version
of
their
ebels
weiss
hefeweizen
this
is
really
quite
tasty
ah
it
was
alright
pretty
drinkable
although
more
flavor
in
any
direction
whether
it
be
more
roastiness
or
more
hefeweizen
characteristics
good
price
point
but
wouldnt
seek
out
otherwise
this
one
is
pretty
drinkable
and
im
not
usually
a
dunkelweizen
fan
or
wheat
beer
in
general
for
that
matter
but
this
one
has
a
distinct
enough
profile
where
it
distracts
from
the
clove
my
worst
enemy
o
i
wish
i
would
have
looked
at
reviews
before
my
spontaneous
joyfilled
purchase
it
seems
there
had
been
issues
even
when
fresh
then
again
i
knew
what
i
was
getting
into
buying
an
old
beer
still
its
not
as
bad
as
some
reviews
have
made
it
out
to
be
even
with
its
age
i
hate
to
tank
a
rating
but
in
reality
there
is
an
infection
here
and
the
beer
didnt
have
anything
to
fight
back
with
if
you
still
have
this
beer
drink
or
destroy
holy
carbonation
batman
seriously
13
of
a
inch
of
beer
and
a
whole
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
filled
with
head
jeez
thats
a
shit
ton
of
head
serious
lacing
all
the
way
down
the
glass
bad
sign
only
time
ive
ever
seen
that
much
head
is
in
a
infected
beer
im
glad
i
put
in
the
the
kegerator
when
i
did
otherwise
my
cellar
might
have
been
a
tad
stickier
the
nose
is
interesting
muted
notes
of
caramel
and
toast
mixed
with
green
apple
skins
and
pie
cherries
the
flavor
is
much
the
same
but
the
sour
pie
cherries
and
green
apples
dominate
the
flavor
profile
pushing
the
caramel
and
toast
to
the
outskirts
of
the
flavor
profile
its
not
horrific
at
all
but
it
doesnt
seem
like
its
supposed
to
be
there
either
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
think
its
turned
into
something
that
its
not
supposed
to
be
i
once
had
a
barleywine
that
picked
up
a
slight
infection
that
just
lent
itself
to
a
mild
tartness
in
the
background
made
it
really
tasty
this
is
more
along
the
same
lines
malt
is
still
there
but
its
definitely
secondary
the
the
tartness
of
the
beer
it
kind
of
hits
you
in
the
back
of
the
jaw
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
decent
kick
good
representation
of
style
although
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
this
is
still
a
solid
beer
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
quite
drinkable
but
somewhat
sweet
clearly
cold
weather
beer
not
a
bad
offering
from
two
brothers
but
i
like
some
of
there
other
stuff
better
drinkbility
overall
an
enjoyable
fallwinter
seasonal
that
i
would
like
more
access
to
i
think
these
two
brothers
should
move
into
pittsburgh
they
are
makin
some
great
versions
of
classic
styles
and
this
one
sits
no
differently
d
i
should
have
done
my
research
and
checked
out
the
reviews
on
this
one
before
getting
it
the
drain
ended
up
getting
more
of
this
one
than
i
did
i
was
all
excited
to
try
different
dunkelweizens
but
this
one
is
a
big
disappointment
stay
away
i
wish
i
had
sampled
this
beer
at
room
temp
poured
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
dark
chestnut
hue
with
garnet
tints
and
fizzy
beige
head
of
4
cm
foaming
up
even
with
a
gentle
pour
would
have
overflowed
without
precautions
taken
aroma
is
chocolate
malt
and
roasted
notes
a
little
fruity
but
not
as
complex
as
i
had
hoped
not
too
much
twang
in
there
either
first
sip
reveals
an
average
body
and
rolling
gentle
carbonation
flavor
is
very
mild
but
similar
to
nose
with
bits
of
brown
sugar
and
chocolate
and
a
hint
of
dark
red
fruit
plums
no
hops
or
abv
show
through
but
again
not
very
complex
flavor
the
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
subtleties
and
mix
of
flavors
i
am
a
little
disappointed
my
first
time
experiencing
a
dunkle
weiss
i
was
skeptical
at
first
since
i
dont
care
for
weiss
beers
this
is
very
different
than
the
usual
weiss
when
it
is
poured
bonfire
looks
like
root
beer
with
a
very
thick
but
light
head
the
color
is
similar
to
root
beer
as
well
it
has
a
sweet
flavor
with
a
rich
coffeechocolate
aftertaste
i
learned
tonight
that
i
dont
mind
a
dunkle
weiss
but
dont
prefer
it
either
d
drinkable
and
interesting
two
brothers
is
a
pretty
solid
brewery
this
is
not
one
of
their
finer
efforts
its
okay
but
suffers
from
overcarbonation
and
a
strong
banana
deficiency
ultimately
the
flavor
never
really
materializes
into
what
id
hoped
it
would
be
those
probably
wouldnt
be
big
problems
to
correct
fix
it
and
get
this
fire
blazing
its
worth
a
try
stick
with
a
single
bomber
though
this
was
served
with
a
small
light
tan
head
and
a
little
lace
color
is
a
fairly
hazy
very
dark
mahoganey
aroma
was
roasty
dark
malt
pumpernickle
rye
a
little
dark
ripe
fruit
and
not
a
lot
of
spice
flavor
is
dominated
by
tartness
then
a
little
bittersweetness
the
above
aroma
characteristics
and
a
little
nuttiness
body
is
ok
a
bit
sharp
finish
is
mainly
dark
sour
malt
nothing
special
but
not
too
bad
d
this
one
is
enough
for
me
maybe
ill
check
back
in
on
the
next
uninfected
batch
so
after
a
delicate
twenty
minute
long
pour
the
beer
is
finally
ready
to
be
drank
how
annoying
the
beer
is
a
dark
brown
color
perhaps
the
darkest
dunkelweizen
ive
yet
seen
but
alright
the
head
is
massive
and
doesnt
recedes
the
aroma
has
the
nasty
chemically
breadiness
to
it
it
smells
nothing
like
a
dunkelweizen
unfortunately
this
translates
over
into
the
taste
there
is
some
roasted
malt
and
chocolate
with
a
hint
of
yeast
that
cover
some
of
it
up
but
it
is
still
there
it
is
also
lacking
of
the
usual
banana
bread
and
clove
that
are
expected
in
the
dunkelweizen
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
likely
carbonation
overall
this
beer
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
seems
like
two
brothers
was
trying
for
a
dunkelweizenporter
hybrid
along
the
lines
of
new
glarus
black
wheat
if
that
is
truly
what
they
were
going
for
they
were
completely
off
on
the
other
hand
if
they
were
going
for
a
traditional
dunkelweizen
they
were
way
off
too
the
aroma
makes
me
scared
with
every
sip
that
it
will
taste
like
it
smells
that
and
the
over
carbonated
pour
make
this
beer
a
something
i
would
not
recommend
overall
very
easy
drinking
beer
this
bomber
didnt
take
me
too
long
to
finish
i
really
liked
it
good
representation
of
the
style
and
i
would
buy
more
d
very
drinkable
but
not
much
to
it
overall
just
a
average
beer
if
it
wasnt
for
the
beer
notebook
i
would
have
completely
forgotten
about
this
one
drinkability
is
great
i
enjoyed
this
one
and
could
enjoy
several
more
would
love
to
see
it
on
tap
sometime
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
good
carbonation
goes
down
easy
enough
but
in
the
end
it
just
doesnt
really
strike
a
chord
with
me
bonfire
dunkel
weiss
dark
wheat
ale
is
not
one
of
two
brotherss
better
efforts
having
said
that
its
a
decent
example
of
the
style
that
would
probably
be
just
fine
after
a
few
wellchosen
tweaks
a
purchase
price
of
5
99
isnt
too
bad
for
a
bomber
but
a
second
chance
probably
isnt
in
the
cards
this
is
easy
to
kick
back
definitely
i
need
to
find
a
sixer
now
i
love
a
good
dunkel
weiss
and
this
joins
the
ranks
way
to
go
bros
drinkability
while
i
could
drink
a
few
more
bottles
i
see
no
overwhelming
reason
to
probably
the
most
disappointing
two
brothers
beer
ive
had
their
beers
are
normally
very
good
very
well
balanced
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
dark
reddish
brown
diluted
milk
chocolate
head
leaves
a
wispy
lace
light
aromas
of
caramel
and
chocolate
malts
light
toast
and
ghost
nuttiness
flavors
of
pumpernickle
and
toasted
bread
crusts
very
light
roasted
malt
flavors
again
hints
of
nut
finishes
with
faintly
sweet
caramel
mouthfeel
is
slick
and
thin
drinkability
is
effortless
a
nice
easy
drinker
i
would
have
preferred
more
maltiness
and
a
bigger
body
on
this
sausages
anyone
not
a
great
dunkel
but
a
drinkable
dark
brown
with
a
decent
white
head
and
substantial
lace
down
the
glass
boozy
spicey
chocolate
aroma
aboveaverage
carbonation
and
about
average
mouthfeel
as
a
tad
more
watery
than
i
would
expect
i
taste
a
bunch
of
cloves
first
and
foremost
and
then
chocolate
fairly
sourish
finish
could
be
much
creamier
probably
could
use
a
bit
more
carbonation
and
the
body
isnt
as
full
as
others
of
the
genre
still
a
nice
entry
from
two
bros
and
a
worthwhile
brew
to
give
a
shot
overall
this
beer
failed
my
expectations
of
a
dunkelweizen
it
is
too
bad
this
was
my
first
two
brothers
beer
as
ive
heard
nothing
but
good
things
about
them
but
this
really
did
not
impress
me
it
is
drinkable
but
not
what
i
expect
from
the
style
a
decentdrinking
beer
but
a
bit
underwhelming
for
a
dunkelweizen
wow
surprised
at
two
bros
with
this
one
usually
they
produce
tasty
brews
this
one
misses
the
mark
badly
drinkability
a
decent
brew
crafty
but
not
all
that
enticing

atmosphere
subdued
but
complex
flavor
and
nose
great
light
feel
but
taste
is
not
sacrificed
all
of
this
makes
for
great
drinkability
great
quaff
one
more
thing
the
bottle
i
purchased
claimed
6

abv
not
the

5
listed
on
this
site
was
gibt
es
d
solid
drinkable
brew
that
met
my
expectations
d
this
beer
is
a
bit
bland
with
the
flavors
coming
through
being
a
bit
off
and
one
dimensional
d
i
highly
suggest
that
all
sediment
be
swirled
around
and
poured
into
your
glass
doing
so
really
dials
in
a
toastycreamychocolatey
presence
that
i
think
is
what
the
folks
at
two
brothers
were
going
for
with
this
beer
very
enjoyable
md
medium
to
full
bodied
carbonation
a
bit
prickly
but
overall
a
mostly
silky
and
smooth
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
a
pretty
nice
example
of
the
style
drinkability
in
the
end
it
was
a
nice
light
dunkelweizen
but
it
just
didnt
anything
for
me
i
liked
almost
everything
this
beer
had
to
offer
but
it
just
didnt
anything
for
me
maybe
its
the
dunkelweizen
style
two
brothers
brews
a
few
quality
brews
and
this
is
another
one
on
that
list
it
is
worth
a
shot
not
really
unless
you
really
like
dunkelweizens
or
two
brothers
beers
if
not
then
you
can
pass
this
one
up
one
of
these
was
enough
for
me
slightly
less
complex
than
kyle
ortons
neck
beard
though
infinitely
more
drinkable
this
one
reminds
me
of
the
packers
season
full
of
hope
with
flashes
of
brillaince
but
overall
a
let
down
pours
a
good
two
finger
head
after
the
pour
that
retains
to
a
ring
of
foam
dark
cola
colored
ruby
beer
with
strong
bubbling
figgy
and
some
chocolatey
aromas
plus
some
light
roasted
malts
as
well
fruity
toasted
and
roasted
malts
give
layers
of
complexity
to
this
dunkle
weiss
plums
and
cocoa
and
figs
complex
and
tastey
dunkle
with
a
malty
fruity
palate
and
a
juicey
feel
pours
a
super
murky
brown
with
a
quick
two
finger
light
tan
head
thatdies
down
to
a
thin
layer
of
foam
some
stick
remains
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
after
swirling
but
not
much
smell
consists
of
chocolate
covered
bananas
with
some
smokey
malts
and
grains
metallic
notes
roasted
marshmallows
and
gritty
earth
in
the
nose
as
well
a
nice
aromatic
balance
between
toasty
and
sweet
taste
starts
off
with
metallic
banana
bread
and
brown
sugar
interesting
midway
dark
wheat
flavors
emerge
on
the
tongue
with
clove
nuts
and
cocoa
powder
unfortunately
this
beer
suffers
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
wet
carboard
flavor
caramel
and
ashy
bark
light
to
medium
body
with
a
somewhat
smooth
feel
but
the
strong
carbonation
sting
really
gets
in
the
way
i
must
say
though
the
7
5
is
hidden
quite
well
a
nice
winter
beer
but
a
bit
rough
around
the
edges
thanks
for
the
chance
to
give
this
bad
boy
a
try
dan
overall
ive
had
only
one
or
two
dunkleweiss
beers
before
this
one
and
im
not
sure
if
its
my
style
i
enjoy
this
particular
one
for
what
it
is
and
the
thing
i
liked
the
most
about
the
flavor
was
the
unexpected
sourness
made
it
quite
refreshing
despite
that
though
i
doubt
i
will
pick
this
up
again
but
im
sure
some
would
enjoy
it
immensely
drinkability
honestly
the
beer
isnt
bad
while
cold
but
once
it
warms
the
sweetness
really
is
a
bit
overbearing
its
fairly
cloying
and
becomes
a
bit
too
much
unfortunately
the
best
part
of
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
and
look
not
the
worst
beer
ive
ever
had
but
not
my
favorite
from
two
brothers
d
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
and
rebuy
dark
murky
mess
of
brown
liquid
bubbly
light
brown
head
barely
and
lacing
is
damn
near
absent
aroma
is
muddy
earthy
and
vegetal
a
little
clove
and
chocolate
but
the
nose
is
mostly
goth
flavor
is
phenolic
a
little
roasty
slight
anise
and
some
bread
pudding
all
in
all
pretty
agreeable
easy
to
drink
smooth
feel
to
it
close
to
medium
in
body
decent
enough
but
not
really
up
to
two
brothers
standards
not
a
well
done
dunkelweizen
the
6
2
abv
is
well
hidden
in
this
light
bodied
beer
it
was
also
a
bit
expensive
as
well
there
are
many
dunkleweizens
that
are
better
and
cheaper
on
the
market
a
nice
dunkelweizen
but
i
would
have
liked
the
banana
to
show
up
in
the
flavor
this
is
a
very
solid
and
drinkable
beer
im
a
big
fan
of
the
beer
and
the
brewery
as
i
find
with
most
two
brothers
offerings
this
was
good
not
great
its
a
fun
style
to
play
with
but
i
wouldnt
be
sad
to
let
the
rest
of
this
season
pass
without
having
another
bonfire
very
drinkable
like
this
one
a
lot
tastes
cidery
there
are
grape
and
clove
notes
with
sort
of
a
funky
yeast
presence
that
doesnt
help
things
it
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
with
a
sort
of
slick
feeling
the
body
is
thinner
than
a
dunkelweisseweizenbock
about
as
light
as
a
standard
hefeweizen
i
finished
the
pint
but
didnt
really
enjoy
it
this
is
a
brand
new
keg
as
this
was
just
released
i
dont
have
high
hopes
for
the
bottled
version
although
this
may
be
a
bad
draft
line
issue
not
likely
looking
at
other
bottle
reviews
a
lightly
hazy
dark
wheat
beer
with
a
thin
but
persistent
white
head
aromas
of
wheat
malt
chocolate
and
bananaclove
yeast
notes
leaning
more
toward
the
clove
solid
toasted
malt
flavor
with
enough
roastiness
to
balance
little
hop
presence
until
the
aftertaste
a
very
easydrinking
beer
for
one
with
as
much
flavor
as
it
has
and
a
welcome
addition
to
tbbs
lineup
since
it
uses
the
same
yeast
and
hops
as
their
yearround
ebel
weiss
brew
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
see
this
one
make
a
return
appearance
maybe
next
year
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
welcomed
addition
to
the
two
brothers
family
the
growler
went
well
when
split
between
three
people
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
that
goes
nicely
with
food
delicious
enjoyed
it
very
much
the
germans
know
their
beer
nice
beer
prior
to
beginning
drinking
microcraft
beer
i
would
have
said
this
was
great
now
with
the
abundance
of
amazing
local
ales
most
foreign
beers
have
lost
their
cachet
the
bitterness
of
this
offering
is
not
for
me
both
thin
in
mouthfeel
and
i
got
only
coffee
malty
aromas
and
taste
rather
than
fruityester
weissen
decent
beer
but
not
particularly
distinguished
or
memorable
it
has
dark
brown
and
hazy
colour
it
smells
bready
and
roasty
malt
its
taste
is
average
comparing
with
other
dunkels
at
the
end
you
can
feel
the
bitterness
however
i
tasted
erdinger
picantus
yesterday
personally
i
think
that
picantus
is
better
than
this
dunkel
if
you
have
a
chance
you
should
taste
picantus
a
huge
fluffy
light
tan
head
sits
atop
a
dark
brown
brew
smells
of
banana
citrus
coriander
and
a
bit
of
pine
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
smell
a
dull
intro
is
followed
up
by
malts
mixed
with
faint
bananas
and
a
bit
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightbodied
carbonation
is
fairly
active
crisp
smooth
and
just
enough
after
taste
i
like
this
beer
and
will
look
forward
to
my
next
drink
overall
pretty
good
above
average
even
but
it
is
not
the
best
you
will
come
across
and
not
as
balanced
in
the
flavour
as
i
would
hope
for
very
nice
dunkel
this
has
a
surprising
amount
of
carbonation
that
helps
push
out
the
toasty
malt
flavours
its
not
overly
complex
or
layered
just
tasty
once
you
get
past
the
yeastcorn
nose
and
let
this
sit
in
your
mouth
you
can
appreciate
the
overall
balance
of
the
erdinger
dunkel
it
smells
great
and
tastes
nice
average
dunkelweisen
sweet
malt
raisins
dates
no
trace
of
hops
decent
but
no
weihenstephaner
tap
one
is
better
than

o
unless
this
was
an
old
beer
this
was
a
horrible
beer
and
i
poured
half
of
it
out
lite
and
refreshing

perfect

which

its
definitely

but

aside
its
still
really

drinkable
but
nothing
special
about

the

lacklustre

light

notes
with
some

muddled
and
indistinct
soso

goes
down
without

but
a
pretty
forgettable
dunkel
no
need
to

down
overall
this
is
a
great
mild
beer
for
someone
not
looking
to
adventure
outside
the
box
this
beer
is
sweet
with
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
dont
let
its
dark
haziness
fool
you
into
thinking
this
will
be
too
rich
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
and
it
gets
extra
points
because
of
its
cheap
price
roasted
malt
and
wheat
flavors
dominate
with
a
definite
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
i
enjoyed
this
one
poured
from
bottle
aroma
of
hay
and
herbs
pours
very
dark
brown
with
big
head
very
mild
bitter
taste
full
bodied
oily
texture
with
lively
carbonation
overall
it
looks
like
a
dark
beer
but
tastes
quite
close
to
other
weizen
beers
o
who
would
have
thought
serving
temperature
affects
the
beer
at
least
i
got
another
reminder
with
this
tasting
experience
served
at
the
proper
temperature
this
was
a
nice
balanced
brew
that
focused
on
the
malt
profile
and
let
the
esters
play
second
fiddle
clean
and
well
brewed
good
drinkability
personally
i
think
id
prefer
a
dunkel
with
more
emphasis
on
the
yeast
produced
flavors
o
this
was
actually
a
great
beer
however
it
was
not
a
very
good
example
of
what
i
expect
from
a
dunkelweizen
i
wonder
if
this
beer
wasnt
fermented
at
the
low
limit
of
the
temperature
range
for
its
yeast
picked
this
up
at
oak
barrell
in
hagerstown
excellent
looking
beer
darker
than
many
which
i
liked
had
that
delicious
look
smell
was
odd
more
of
a
caramel
than
wheat
taste
was
outstanding
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
this
was
quite
the
surprise
i
liked
it
very
much
but
may
not
buy
often
as
others
i
like
more
that
cost
less
overall
ive
never
thought
that
the
wheat
and
dark
malts
have
worked
all
that
well
together
except
in
rare
circumstances
this
is
lacking
that
special
quality
but
still
tastes
pretty
good
o
my
first
dunkelweizen
ever
happens
to
be
very
flavourful
though
onesided
while
being
simultaneously
drinkable
this
beer
went
down
ridiculously
fast
definitely
wouldnt
mind
having
more
in
the
future
body
medium
watery
lively
carbonation
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
78
o
i
enjoy
this
style
so
even
though
it
is
bland
by
the
standards
of
the
style
i
like
it
i
just
with
it
had
some
spice
to
it
it
is
easy
drinking
but
ill
stick
with
my
favorites
in
this
style
overall
a
very
good
german
wheat
beer
but
not
quite
good
enough
to
advance
to
the
head
of
the
class
the
flavor
is
a
bit
mild
and
the
phenols
and
esters
dont
run
quite
deep
enough
still
one
heck
of
a
nice
beer
o
i
nice
lighter
version
of
a
dunkel
i
enjoyed
the
added
raisin
notes
and
enjoyed
this
much
more
than
erdingers
regular
hefe
a
very
affordable
beer
as
well
a
quality
pint
of
beer
for
2
bucks
is
always
welcomed
o
a
deep
inviting
beer
for
those
that
like
this
style
easy
to
drink
even
though
many
will
be
put
off
by
its
dark
appearance
although
i
prefer
other
erdinger
beers
as
this
one
feels
a
bit
too
heavy
on
the
taste
buds
overall
i
sometimes
get
caught
up
in
the
world
of
american
craft
beer
with
something
new
coming
out
every
day
and
forget
about
some
of
the
really
great
beers
that
have
been
around
forever
the
darker
fruits
in
this
beer
really
shine
through
all
the
traditional
hefe
accents
one
would
look
for
taste
starts
out
slightly
metallic
but
not
so
much
that
it
ruins
the
beer
roasted
malt
with
a
toffee
like
backing
comes
huge
carbonation
that
just
explodes
in
the
mouth
like
a
cola
its
quite
distracting
and
thins
out
the
beer
mf
mediumlight
bodies
semidry
finish
rather
thin
but
well
carbonated
and
bright
in
the
mouth

0
o
looks
great
but
slides
downhill
thereafter
i
wouldnt
bother
with
this
one
again
overall
a
nice
easy
beer
a
rather
safe
and
low
on
flavor
version
yet
its
still
a
pleasure
to
drink
not
a
world
class
or
well
done
version
of
this
style
but
its
certainly
worth
drinking
for
anyone
that
wants
a
easy
drinker
with
low
alcohol
and
still
can
cover
the
craving
of
a
good
solid
craft
beer
o
nothing
special
not
a
lot
of
flavour
nothing
bad
but
nothing
you
will
look
for
o
i
am
admittedly
in
love
with
this
beer
so
much
so
that
i
plan
to
pick
a
few
bottles
up
the
next
time
i
go
to
purchase

it

had
a
bottle
at
a
beer
parlor
in
calgarys
kensington
area
this
dark
wheat
offering
pours
a
murky
opaque
brown
almost
like
coffee
with
just
the
faintest
hint
of
cream
mixed
in
aroma
was
dark
malts
and
hefe
yeast
all
the
way
no
discernible

but
a
decent
amount
fruit
and
spice
a
bit
like
pumpkin
pie
palate

chewy
dark

and
yeast
phenols
i
get
a
lot
of
stone

cherry
plum

creme
flavors
with
a
healthy
dose
of
spicy

and
some
toasty
notes
that
are
not
out
of
place
in
the
sea
of
dark
malt
and
yeast
body
is
chewy
and
rich
albeit
thinner
than
a
huge
doppelbock
or
the
like
the
rich
malty
character
and
spicy
yeast
leads
the
way
but
there
is
a
decently
bitter
finish
that
includes
some
herbal
hops
but
you
have
to
look
for
this
and
syrupy
booze
solid
german
wheat
beer
albeit
more
coarse
and
perhaps
rough
around
the
edges
than
some
other
examples
would
have
liked
to
see
the
sweet
flavors
pop
out
a
bit
more
enjoy
overall
this
beer
isnt
much
to
look
at
also
unlike
a
good
weissbier
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
fairly
one
dimensional
sweet
malt
the
beer
looks
and
taste
like
dr
pepper
weird
httpwww
facebook
comkajiisbeerreviews
overall
an
above
average
beer
that
is
very
straightforward
feels
lacking
some
character
light
to
medium
body
leaves
a
yeast
residue
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
overall
a
fine
beer
but
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
the
style
however
always
worth
drinking
especially
if
a
certain
other
legendary
german
brewer
does
not
have
their
dunkelweizen
in
stock
o
this
is
okay
i
certainly
would
try
again
but
im
not
incredibly
impressed
overall
considering
how
much
i
normally
like
wheat
beers
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
overall
45
a
nice
flavorful
beer
although
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
would
have
guessed
but
not
overly
so
it
does
go
down
easy
and
is
worth
trying
o
its
one
the
most
wellbalanced
beers
ive
ever
tasted
makes
you
want
to
drink
one
after
another
a
light
body
dunkel
with
good
drinkability
though
i
found
the
other
erdingers
more
interesting
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
the
finish
is
easy
its
extremely
drinkable
and
really
a
treat
i
would
have
this
many
times
again
mouth
feel
is
full
bodied
good
thickness
and
well
rounded
high
carbonation
easy
to
drink
and
very
pleasant
no
astringency
odefinitely
not
how
an
authentic
german
should
be
tasting
still
though
its
an
enjoyable
beer
by
all
means
i
just
expect
a
lot
more
in
terms
of
raw
flavor
o
really
goodi
like
it
overall
an
okay
attempt
but
this
is
really
an
example
of
how
bland
some
wheat
beers
can
get
poured
a
500ml
bottle
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
fairly
shortlived
creamy
light
tan
head
probably
due
to
the
glass
used
but
it
did
linger
and
leave
some
lacing
nice
deep
brown
almost
black
and
no
light
gets
through
not
much
aroma
detected
but
had
a
nice
roasted
malt
taste
with
coffee
and
little
bitterness
on
the
finish
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
as
well
o
first
ever
dunkel
but
id
gladly
try
more
a
good
beer
that
id
drink
again
500
ml

very
hazy
dark
brown
color
with
a
nice
2
finger
dense
and
fluffy
light
khaki
head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
rocky
cap
that
lasts
spotty
foamy
lacing
clings
down
the

with
plenty
of
streaming
carbonation
retaining
the

on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
dark

with
good
robustness
of
flavor
and
zero
cloying
flavors
present
after
the
finish
as
expected
mediumhigh
carbonation
and
medium
bodied
with
a
moderately
creamy
and
very
crisp
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
at
all
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
damn
nice
dunkelweizen
very
nice
balance
and
complexity
of
malt
and
yeast
ester
flavors
and
extremely
smooth
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
well
rounded
example
of
the
style
pours
a
hazy
dark
brown
with
an
impressive
tan
head
that
has
good
staying
power
as
well
as
lacing
a
visually
impressive
pour
aroma
is
wheat
and
german
yeast
forward
although
with
some
caramelized
and
roasted
dark
malt
undertones
very
rarely
do
i
pick
up
on
toffee
that
many
others
smell
but
even
i
can
find
it
in
this
nose
the
sweet
flavour
is
rather
simple
and
uninspiring
but
true
to
form
caramel
notes
and
some
roasted
malts
but
i
find
the
wheat
and
yeast
typical
of
this
style
pretty
overwhelming
as
im
not
a
big
fan
of
either
flavour
this
is
the
first
time
ive
purchased
this
beer
outside
of
germany
o
the
tin
flavour
just
takes
it
all
away
for
me
not
all
that
great
of
a
wheat
dunkel
load
of
citrus
and
dark
fruits
contact
the
palate
sensation
bready
malt
and
hint
of
roasted
malt
participate
with
some
spiciness
the
body
is
medium
with
smooth
mouthfeel
and
dry
finish
pretty
good
overall
rjt
o
i
was
very
disappointed
by
this
beer
fortunately
i
drank
it
after
finishing
my
excellent
austrian
meal
so
it
did
not
get
in
the
way
of
that
no
spectacular
beer
o
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
does
not
have
the
same
strength
of
flavor
and
aroma
that
some
other
examples
have
in
the
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
but
not
anything
special
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
beer
was
the
depth
to
the
grain
profile
in
both
the
nose
and
taste
if
we
had
one
complaint
it
was
that
the
nose
was
a
bit
too
light
we
wish
that
it
popped
more
right
from
the
time
of
opening
the
bottle
the
flavoring
was
robust
enough
and
was
well
balanced
among
the
complexity
for
a
nice
treat
overall
this
is
definitely
a
great
brew
having
this
during
a
barbeque
priceless
drink
up
and
enjoy
salud
this
is
good
stuff
quite
nice
to
drink
wouldnt
rank
it
up
with
weihenstephaner
for
a
couple
setbacks
it
doesnt
have
the
same
depth
of
standout
flavour
and
the
mouthfeel
while
pleasant
is
far
less
full
and
has
more
of
a
thin
carbonation
aspect
still
worth
trying
and
nice
drinkable
stuff
i
liked
this
one
on
sale
at
the
duty
free
fridge
in
delhi
india
poured
a
reddish
brown
color
with
a
glorious
rising
off
white
head
smells
like
fruity
yeast
german
malts
of
many
varieties
and
a
touch
of
hops
flavor
is
nice
very
well
balanced
without
the
sweetness
that
usually
comes
with
this
style
more
of
an
amber
taste
to
me
with
the
wheat
malt
being
playing
more
of
a
supporting
role
notes
of
caramel
and
banana
also
present
themselves
in
turn
feel
is
a
little
light
i
think
but
i
liked
this
beer
a
lot
despite
that
its
got
relaxed
bubbles
and
a
long
complex
finish
i
could
have
drank
quite
a
number
of
these
if
i
had
more
rupees
good
juice
pours
an
opaque
dark
brown
with
a
2
inch
foamy
dark
khaki
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheat
caramel
and
some
yeast
aromas
taste
is
of
wheat
and
caramel
mainly
with
some
slight
yeast
flavors
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
that
is
easy
drinking
but
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
one
d
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
even
in
my
limited
exposure
to
dunkels
ive
certainly
tasted
better
just
an
average
runofthemill
german
brew
but
a
drinkable
and
solid
one
at
that
not
a
bad
offering
from
the
worlds

this
is
just
ok
but
nothing
about
this
really
comes
together
for
me
honestly
cant
picture
a
situation
where
i
would
have
this
again
this
beer
is
pretty
good
a
little
to
much
carmel
flavor
for
me
wont
turn
it
down
but
wont
rush
to
buy
it
again
after
all
i
really
like
beer
it
was
about
3
12
dollars
at
the
local
beer
store
in
calgary
i
tend
to
think
theres
probably
many
other
beers
that
are
a
better
bang
for
the
buck
o
i
was
very
surprised
with
this
one
i
have
not
been
a
strong
fan
of
their
standard
hefeweizen
and
didnt
expect
much
the
sample
at
the
brewery
definitely
would
rate
up
their
with
the
best
of
this
style
that
i
have
tasted
what
a
wonderful
beer
indeed
highly
recommended
overall
not
bad
but
not
great
reminiscent
of
something
like
negra
modelo
but
with
more
of
a
wheatlike
profile
o
a
good
dunkel
for
a
good
cheap
price
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
wine
goblet
impressive
head
am
deep
brown
ruby
brown
color
smell
is
not
aggressive
but
can
smell
malt
over
wheat
sweet
like
brown
sugar
influenced
by
the
malts
some
wheatiness
but
not
like
most
jefe
style
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
an
appreciated
carbonation
in
there
overall
a
nice
dunked
jefe
and
certainly
sessionable
poured
from
a
550
ml
bottle
into
a
snifter
best
before
032012
this
pours
a
dark
brown
almost
black
with
a
large
foamy
mocha
colored
head
the
smell
is
a
little
weaker
than
expected
a
little
wheat
roasted
malts
coco
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
with
high
carbonation
the
taste
is
okay
wheat
spices
dark
malts
o
a
nice
example
of
a
classic
german
dunkelweizen
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
i
think
this
ones
an
industry
stranded
for
a
dunkel
nothing
too
be
ashamed
of
but
nothing
worth
searching
for
o
well
rounded
dunkel
from
a
classy
brewery
o
very
different
than
other
dunkels
but
this
is
the
worlds
most
popular
weissbier
dunkel
for
a
reason
its
damn
good
not
my
bag
baby
but
not
terrible
like
warren
beatty
said
nice
drinkability
is
fair
its
a
good
occasional
choice
d
i
like
how
this
beer
feels
in
the
mouth
but
the
flavor
dissapoints
it
seems
to
be
very
one
dimensional
in
flavor
with
roasted
coffee
overwhelming
the
tastebuds
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
another
bottle
d
ridiculously
refreshing
not
a
ton
of
flavor
here
a
touch
of
roast
there
and
touch
of
fruit
here
overall
a
refreshing
highly
drinkable
brew
o
this
beer
is
wellmade
and
very
clean
tasting
but
i
find
it
too
clinical
and
bland
you
would
not
know
you
were
drinking
a
german
wheat
beer
very
uninteresting
pours
jet
black
with
a
light
tan
head
in
the
aroma
quite
roasty
with
nice
coffee
notes
in
the
taste
a
small
roast
with
notes
of
coffee
and
some
lingering
hints
of
wheat
and
lemon
citrus
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
citrus
and
coffee
like
aftertaste
nice
coffee
roast
and
a
refreshing
lemon
citrus
to
back
it
up
theres
a
date
of
32012
so
this
should
be
considered
fresh
enough
but
i
feel
like
something
has
gone
wrong
here
this
just
seems
off
especially
for
the
always
by
the
book
germans
taste
roasty
and
bready
with
soft
fruit
and
spicy
cloves
o
not
nearly
as
comples
or
flavorful
as
other
german
dunkels
but
smooth
and
very
drinkable
not
the
best
but
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
overall
just
a
good
beer
and
not
much
else
had
it
on
tap
at
the
oktoberfest
held
in
grand
rapids
and
was
much
fresher
there
and
had
a
crisper
body
there
wasnt
much
i
could
pick
up
on
this
beer
otherwise
but
it
wasnt
bad
o
this
is
a
solid
dunkel
i
would
definitely
revisit
this
again
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkelweizen
o
nothing
spectacular
here
it
is
quite
drinkable
but
i
wish
it
was
more
dense
thats
just
my
taste
solid
brew
and
worth
a
shot
if
this
sounds
good
to
you
i
wont
be
getting
this
one
again
o
not
bad
first
ive
had
of
this
type
subdued
flavors
easy
to
drink
more
exciting
than
the
very
light
wheat
beers
crossposted
on
httpbooksbitesbrews
blogspot
com
overall
it
is
just
an
ok
beer
lacks
depth
of
flavor
yet
is
smooth
and
drinkable
overall
this
was
a
good
experience
im
not
sure
exactly
when
i
would
have
this
kind
of
beer
as
it
isnt
exactly
a
summer
thirstquencher
still
its
worth
a
try
and
generally
quite
easy
to
find
overall
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
with
the
quality
of
this
brew
at
2
99
its
alright
but
in
the
town
over
for
2
49
it
is
better
final
grade

a
b
overall
very
nice
beer
o
mild
this
is
the
boringest
dunkel
ive
ever
had
nothing
stands
out
this
is
just
as
bad
as
the
hefe
scratch
that
its
definitely
worse
i
guess
i
should
of
expected
this
will
look
for
again
o
a
very
nice
wheat
beer
that
is
an
easy
drinker
any
time
of
year
i
like
the
added
malt
as
i
am
not
typically
a
wheat
beer
fan
o
overall
it
started
off
looking
and
smelling
like
a
winner
but
finished
with
a
fizzle
certainly
nothing
to
sneeze
at
but
i
had
higher
expectations
and
hopes
cheers
o
a
suberb
beer
first
time
trying
would
drink
again
overall
very
sessionable
i
have
had
mostly
hefes
lately
i
had
forgotten
just
how
much
i
enjoy
this
style
smooth
and
inviting
o
not
bad
at
all
but
lacks
that
nice
banana
bread
cloves
punch
i
like
about
the
style
nice
on
a
hot
day
though
overall
when
i
first
tried
this
one
i
loved
it
a
little
more
but
now
as
my
palate
is
growing
more
refined
it
doesnt
hit
the
same
notes
that
it
once
did
although
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
still
a
very
quality
wheat
beer
and
probably
one
of
my
favourites
it
is
still
one
of
my
go
tos
when
in
search
of
a
good
wheat
beer
but
its
just
not
in
the
same
high
regard
it
once
was
when
i
first
started
trying
new
beers
solid
dark
hefe
clean
and
refreshing
this
beer
pours
a
clear
very
dark
brown
with
2
thick
head
and
lace
lasting
to
the
finish
its
aroma
has
hints
of
banana
dark
chocolate
and
bread
the
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
between
banana
chocolate
malt
sweetness
and
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
smooth
and
has
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
erdinger
weissbier
dunkel
is
an
outstanding
beer
very
drinkable
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
highly
recommended
mouthfeel
creamy
and
buttery
the
average
of
my
two
reviews
is
a
b

very
dark

with
fizzy
mostly
white
foam
little
stickiness
very
pleasant

excellent
overall
this
was
about
as
solid
as
it
gets
a
tremendously
good
beer
that
i
would
love
to
be
able
to
try
again
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
well
worth
a
try
overall
this
dunkelweizen
was
average
at
best
the
flavor
and
aroma
seems
muted
and
were
not
as
full
as
they
should
be
the
typical
flavors
i
would
expect
from
this
style
were
there
but
they
were
muted
and
overpowered
by
dark
fruits
and
tartness
i
have
been
disappointed
with
erdinger
both
beers
i
have
had
from
them
never
meet
my
expectations
i
am
weary
about
trying
any
other
brews
from
them
i
wouldnt
buy
this
again
there
are
much
better
dunkelweizens
out
there
o
really
great
for
me
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
that
i
have
had
i
gotta
get
out
and
try
more
this
is
a
classic
dunkel
however
i
would
say
it
was
less
than
i
had
hoped
in
flavor
overall
at
first
this
tasted
a
little
bit
harsh
but
it
seemed
to
mellow
out
as
i
progressed
through
my
glass
its
a
fairly
decent
beer
but
there
are
so
many
better
options
within
this
style
category
id
rather
be
drinking
d
i
dont
have
any
other
dunkelweizen
to
compare
this
to
but
it
seems
like
a
pretty
solid
representative
of
the
style
if
not
very
complex
not
much
of
a
beer
its
inoffensive
but
thats
a
pretty
short
list
of
positive
attributes
no
need
to
try
this
again
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
has
a
dark
brown
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
of
banana
and
spices
taste
is
somewhat
mild
malts
some
banana
not
really
as
much
clove
or
spice
as
i
expected
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
pretty
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
and
creamy
with
lots
of
fine
carbonation
very
drinkable
i
coould
drink
these
all
night
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
something
i
can
imagine
buying
again
just
not
enough
character
to
the
flavor
or
the
aroma
to
make
it
worth
the
expense
pity
scented
nose
dried
fruits
of
autumn
but
no
real
coffee
beans
instead
of
wheat
but
light
enough
compared
to
other
weizenbieren
fairly
light
body
with
a
little
acidity
significantly
aftertaste
which
is
reminiscent
of
jam
both
bitter
and
slightly
sour
with
an
aftertaste
found
in
nuts
finely
a
good
model
for
the
kind
dunkeweizen
but
without
transcending
it
d
this
one
got
really
dull
after
a
while
wouldnt
buy
this
again
d
good
drinkability
the
thick
creamy
appearance
and
mouthfeel
are
this
dunkels
strong
points
its
not
so
competitively
priced
where
im
from
but
i
definitely
wouldnt
turn
down
a
free
glass
this
is
my
first
dunkel
and
i
find
it
an
extremely
interesting
take
on
wheat
beer
after
several
samples
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
what
i
like
about
it
but
i
definitely
like
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
its
an
overall
good
beer
i
might
have
to
explore
the
erdinger
library
more
this
is
the
2nd
beer
from
them
that
ive
had
that
deviated
from
the
fruity
weizen
notes
and
focused
more
on
the
body
and
spice
character
while
that
can
be
both
good
or
bad
its
a
solid
change
of
pace
unique
and
tasty
stuff
pours
a
beautiful
deep
brown
color
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
by
appearance
one
of
the
darkest
dunkels
i
have
seen
smells
of
wheat
with
dark
fruit
taste
includes
some
nuttiness
with
that
great
dark
wheat
background
mouthfeel
is
medium
drinkability
is
great
a
well
crafted
and
delicious
beer
d
ive
had
this
one
before
but
it
seemed
to
have
less
flavor
this
time
around
nothing
really
stands
out
with
this
beer
but
its
still
decent
id
recommend
to
try
it
at
least
once
i
had
this
beer
in
germany
and
at
a
german
restaurant
in
china
the
first
time
on
tap
and
the
second
time
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
it
was
almost
like
a
dessert
with
a
creamy
taste
extraordinarly
smooth
this
time
from
a
bottle
it
wasnt
as
good
as
i
remembered
but
still
a
high
quality
beer
it
still
had
the
characteristic
barley
smell
with
chocolatesweet
notes
and
went
down
smooth
definitely
good
for
a
session
d
easier
than
some
but
still
heavy
boddied
and
filling
good
though
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
had
lately
nice
dark
flavors
with
some
hefeweizen
characteristics
make
it
refreshing
and
a
tasty
alternative
erdinger
weissbier
dunkel
has
a
brown
colour
and
an
excellent
2
cm
head
that
lasts
it
smells
more
like
a
typical
wheat
beer
than
a
stout
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
first
and
malty
and
the
finish
is
quite
grainy
this
beer
is
quite
thick
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
very
tasty
and
drinkable
overall
kind
of
disappointed
even
though
i
didnt
have
huge
hopes
going
into
this
one
my
girlfriend
likes
the
erdinger
hefeweizen
and
so
she
was
drinking
that
while
i
had
this
and
honestly
hers
had
more
flavor
than
mine
whats
that
about
i
didnt
care
for
this
one
i
would
give
it
a
try
just
to
say
you
had
it
but
dont
expect
much
drinkability
it
doesnt
excite
but
it
certainly
manages
to
go
down
undetected
in
the
rather
positive
sense
of
the
word
ive
already
drunk
two
today
and
i
could
go
on
with
more
excellent
beer
reminds
slighly
czech
dark
lager
beers
and
red
stouts
very
smooth
spicy
and
aromatic
didnt
try
neither
cask
or
ontap
versions
but
the
bottle
version
is
great
the
colour
is
nice
a
little
bit
reddish
but
generally
a
very
good
appearance
d
a
very
enjoyable
dunkel
that
is
a
classic
example
of
the
style
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
if
the
mood
was
right
i
can
only
imagine
that
this
would
be
sublime
on
tap
at
the
source
d
i
found
this
one
to
be
disappointing
i
dont
know
if
the
bottle
was
old
or
what
but
the
flavor
was
really
not
very
good
this
beer
is
ok
at
best
i
would
say
the
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
hues
the
head
starts
out
huge
very
bubbly
then
quickly
disapates
leaving
little
lacing
the
smell
is
mild
with
a
light
malty
odour
the
tast
is
light
also
with
a
malty
flavour
but
to
me
tastes
more
watery
than
it
should
mouthfeel
is
this
beers
strongest
point
as
it
is
so
watery
it
doesnt
feel
harsh
or
overly
alcoholic
overall
i
wasnt
thrilled
by
this
beer
as
i
hoped
i
would
be
but
at
the
same
time
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
gave
me
one
d
very
good
drinkable
beer
easy
to
have
one
after
the
other
4
cheers
d
decent
nice
flavours
mixed
with
a
nice
abv
refreshing
in
a
different
light
pours
a
very
dark
yet
slightly
clear
fizzy
color
with
a
light
tan
head
really
nice
body
and
good
lacing
the
aroma
is
lightly
aromatic
with
some
chocolate
notes
maybe
some
banana
esters
flavor
is
light
and
a
little
bland
for
me
really
doesnt
have
the
chocolate
banana
flavor
i
look
for
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
with
some
fizzy
qualities
but
its
over
carbonated
and
tastes
too
dry
and
boozy
drinkability
isnok
not
the
best
example
i
have
tasted
pours
a
murky
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
soapy
tan
head
that
settles
into
a
light
ring
head
retention
was
fairly
short
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
a
wheat
malt
with
some
metallic
notes
as
well
a
light
banana
not
too
much
in
any
yeasty
goodness
the
taste
has
a
banana
creme
pie
thing
going
which
i
am
not
too
wild
on
with
hefes
or
dunkels
the
metallic
characteristic
can
be
found
in
the
flavor
as
well
as
some
vinous
notes
there
is
some
milk
chocolate
flavors
towards
the
end
which
smooths
out
the
profile
and
is
nice
the
feel
is
moderate
with
fizzy
carbonation
which
cuts
through
the
body
sweet
throughout
on
the
palate
i
would
like
to
see
more
yeasty
phenols
in
this
beer
but
the
flavor
is
not
bad
it
drinks
easy
and
is
refreshing

its

no

there
is
a

not

little

doesnt

have
that
almost
banana
smell
that
some
dunkelweizens
tend
to
have
the
taste
also
isnt
very
strong
either
almost
a
little
bland
a
little
sweet
and
malty
along
with
bready
and
yeasty
as
mentioned
earlier
nothing
jumps
out
at
out
at
you
but
i
will
mention
that
it
does
taste
pure
like
several
german
beers
never
really
been
a
huge
fan
of
the
mouthfeels
of
these
beers
dont
like
the
texture
that
much
so
with
that
i
think
its
pretty
average
from
any
ive
had
despite
that
its
pretty
drinkable
all
in
all
an
ok
beer
nothing
very
unique
about
it
it
is
what
it
is
not
bad
d
the
beer
is
rather
easy
to
consume
although
theres
nothing
particularly
special
that
would
definitely
make
me
want
to
have
another
one
all
in
all
a
good
beer
to
try
dits
definitely
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
a
great
example
of
the
particular
style
imo
definitely
drinkable
but
leaves
you
wanting
a
bit
more
spice
because
it
is
a
very
flat
beer
in
terms
of
overall
depth
worth
a
try
but
probably
wont
be
seeking
it
out
again
d
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
could
have
a
lot
of
good
taste
but
still
relatively
light
bodied
a
good
beer
even
on
a
hot
day
in
bulgaria
mouthfeel
is
mdium
bodied
semi
sweet
and
dry
poured
the
last
inch
to
the
drain
if
only
because
i
had
another
beer
waiting
on
deck
all
the
flavors
are
in
the
right
place
but
maybe
a
bit
thin
and
simple
could
stay
on
this
a
while
though
not
a
bad
dunkel
but
a
bit
darker
than
most
i
e
the
roasted
malts
are
more
obvious
here
preference
in
this
category
would
be
hofbrau
dunkel
but
this
is
great
to
drink
regardless
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
with
the
carbonation
being
below
average
for
the
style
but
still
crisp
a
decent
glass
of
beer
though
flawed
in
imho
the
most
important
places
higher
abv
than
i
would
have
thought
for
this
one
after
tasting
it
drinks
pretty
easy
but
there
isnt
as
much
to
taste
as
i
would
have
expected
id
like
to
try
some
other
beers
of
this
style
to
see
what
the
best
are
supposed
to
be
like
pretty
drinkable
i
dont
think
i
like
it
enough
to
be
motivated
enough
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
though
i
drank
it
didnt
dig
the
sweet
part
of
this
and
all
of
the
elements
missing
from
traditional
versions
of
the
style
with
all
of
the
other
good
complex
and
easily
available
versions
of
this
beer
out
there
there
is
no
way
in
hell
id
seek
this
out
for
another
go
again
it
was
drinkable
but
falls
far
short
of
others
it
is
a
very
easy
drinker
and
the
sweetness
only
slightly
hinders
that
taste
noble
hops
play
a
bigger
part
of
the
taste
than
i
was
expecting
dark
malts
and
a
little
banana
after
the
noble
hops
have
faded
from
my
palate
nothing
outstanding
here
just
a
solid
offering
very
plesant
brew
dark
brown
pour
heady
beige
foam
atop
spices
peat
and
roasted
malts
in
the
nose
flavours
include
sweet
candy
malts
a
subtle
spiceyness
with
mild
earthy
peaty
flavours
in
the
finish
medium
light
bodied
with
a
somewhat
watery
finish
no
trace
of
the
abv
pretty
good
dunkel
notes
nothing
remarkable
but
it
is
one
of
their
better
offerings
and
makes
for
a
fair
dunkelweizen
d
a
dunkelweizen
is
always
a
nice
experience
this
one
was
a
bit
to
light
in
taste
and
smell
to
be
a
topbeer
for
me
overall
id
go
with
the
regular
hefeweizen
anytime
but
anyway
a
good
and
well
made
beer
d
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
with
nice
yeast
character
and
a
touch
of
dark
malt
that
adds
color
and
complexity
to
the
beer
without
overwhelming
it
in
caramel
sweetness
i
particularly
like
the
way
that
the
yeasty
clove
flavor
in
the
finish
compliments
the
sweet
toast
and
toffee
flavors
of
the
malt
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
d
ive
had
better
dunkels
better
hefeweizens
and
have
even
had
better
dark
hefeweizens
this
has
almost
no
relevance
to
hefeweizens
as
far
as
my
palate
is
concerned
this
isnt
a
terrible
brew
but
its
just
lacking
in
complexity
for
those
who
like
dark
malty
brews
check
this
one
out
those
who
prefer
their
hefeweizens
taste
smell
and
feel
like
hefeweizens
this
one
is
probably
not
what
youre
looking
for
almost
void
of
flavor
aside
from
some
chocolate
malt
and
faint
hefe
yeast
the
carbonation
is
soft
the
finish
is
quick
and
clean
but
in
the
end
it
just
doesnt
deliver
overall
excellent
example
of
a
dunkelweizen
as
expected
drinkability
really
quite
drinkable
if
a
little
sweet
i
could
definitely
have
a
couple
of
these
over
fried
food
at
a
pub
had
a
pretty
damn
good
mouthfeel
decently
good
drinkability
i
would
have
consumed
another
had
i
purchased
more
than
one
very
easy
to
drink
like
it
and
will
drink
it
again
d
fairly
easy
drinking
this
dark
wheat
is
enjoyable
in
all
seasons
the
dunkel
imparts
a
more
hearty
feel
for
cold
weather
months
but
also
has
a
refreshing
quality
during
the
summer
as
well
goes
well
with
schnitzel
sausages
even
seafood
or
just
enjoy
by
itself
on
a
relaxing
weekend
afternoon
pours
dark
brown
with
a
fluffy
white
head
strong
caramel
malt
presence
in
aroma
as
well
as
the
flavor
slight
smoke
presence
in
the
flavor
as
well
lightmedium
body
and
a
very
easy
drinker
medium
carbonation
drank
this
with
some
homemade
venison
german
sausage
and
it
was
outstanding
even
though
i
suffered
through
the
overly
light
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
thick
for
that
and
felt
sedimentthick
instead
of
creamy
thick
not
a
bad
beer
necessarily
but
not
one
i
would
drink
again
lacks
any
real
substance
or
bold
flavors
quite
embarrassing
when
compared
to
other
german
dunkels
may
be
a
bit
better
when
fresh
from
the
brewer
but
having
tried
other
erdinger
brews
thats
quite
an
assumption
d
quite
an
easy
beer
to
drink
the
flavor
certainly
isnt
blowyourmind
or
anything
but
overall
its
a
good
beer
d
not
a
bad
beer
i
dont
know
how
this
comapres
to
other
dunkels
but
i
wouldnt
be
resilient
to
try
them
very
tasty
if
you
enjoy
the
taste
of
the
darker
fruits
smooth
tasty
and
very
very
drinkable
of
all
the
dark
wheat
beers
this
is
the
probably
my
favorite
everyday
beer
it
never
disappoints
on
tap
its
even
better
a
highly
drinkable
dunkel
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
worth
a
go
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
this
one
on
tap
and
will
make
sure
i
let
it
warm
a
little
next
time
d
very
tasty
the
best
erdinger
i
have
proven
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
smooth
no
aftertaste
drinkability
is
high
as
it
should
be
a
pretty
good
beer
d
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
damn
good
dunkel
easy
to
drink
with
a
good
taste
is
a
thumbs
up
in
my
book
worth
trying
sometime
final
thoughts
well
this
was
my
first
dunkelweizen
and
i
have
to
say
im
a
fan
ive
really
taken
a
liking
to
wheat
beers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
if
you
are
a
hop
head
you
will
not
enjoy
this
beer
however
i
am
a
bit
of
a
sweet
tooth
and
that
really
comes
out
with
this
one
great
dessert
beer
or
something
to
have
by
the
fireplace
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
a
slightly
watered
down
body
very
prominent
spicy
clove
flavor
with
some
roasted
malt
along
with
strong
citrus
peel
flavor
the
bready
yeast
notes
arent
as
strong
as
i
would
like
resulting
in
the
slightly
watery
feel
also
not
as
much
chocolate
malt
as
expected
to
me
it
just
seems
like
a
dark
hefe
thats
slightly
roasty
with
a
lot
of
clove
and
lemony
zest
i
had
it
cold
and
drinkability
very
good
taste
average
smell
was
almost
like
a
weaker
beer
shoud
smell
if
that
makes
sense
the
drink
was
also
satisfying
but
unmemorable
it
goes
down
fine
but
doesnt
really
leave
any
stong
lasting
impressions
and
thats
the
beer
itself
a
good
beer
with
simple
consistent
and
subtle
flavors
that
is
too
carbonated
and
at
times
perhaps
a
little
too
subtle
very
easy
to
drink
overall
looking
at
other
reviews
makes
me
question
my
particular
bottles
quality
its
drink
before
date
is
still
months
away
so
i
am
not
sure
judging
from
this
bottle
i
would
say
this
beer
isnt
worth
the
time
however
it
comes
from
a
respected
brewery
so
i
will
try
to
get
another
and
rereview
it
soon
overall
a
good
dark
hefeweizen
maybe
slightly
too
light
and
intense
than
desired

that
never

down

good
representation
of
style
this
one
is
a

ive
had
in
the
style
but
its
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
this
kind
of
beer
overall
i
like
this
beer
because
i
like
hefeweizens
and
this
is
like
two
hefeweizens
in
one
bomber
tasty
and
fun
to
drink
it
might
get
a
little
old
after
two
or
three
glasses
but
its
a
interesting
change
from
the
same
old

sunshine

with
some
spicy
cloves
and
some
caramel
tossed
in
there
for
kicks
as
well
fair
amount
of

makes
this
one
lighter
in

than
i
expected
but
strangely
smooth

well

features
a
very
low

some
bready
notes
malt
sweetness
easily
detected
with
the
yeast
ever
present
i
found
the
smell
of
this
beer
to
be
the
star
of
this
show
instead
of
the
taste
the
smell
was
slightly
more
enjoyable
than
the
taste
but
still
it
was
a
good
experience
a
good
introductiongateway
to
the
style
and
one
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
d
decent
for
the
style
but
i
dont
think
id
really
want
another
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
but
i
doubt
ill
seek
it
out
again
with
better
options
available
ayinger
and
weihenstephaner
do
the
same
style
to
a
much
much
better
degree
but
it
is
hard
to
find
many
dunkel
beers
in
the
uk
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
i
probably
wont
pick
this
one
up
again
d
to
my
humble
opinion
this
beers
seems
like
a
hybrid
between
a
weizen
and
a
guiness
i
really
like
this
one
its
my
favorite
german
beer
next
to
aventinus
and
sternweizen
hazy
dark
brown
with
a
creamy
tan
cap
that
leaves
some
fine
lace
on
the
glass
the
nose
is
really
faint
and
comprised
of
roasted
malt
and
cocoa
the
taste
is
pretty
malty
and
roasty
with
some
nutty
yeastiness
in
the
finish
not
the
most
flavorful
example
of
the
style
medium
light
bodied
with
bright
carbonation
tasty
brew
but
a
little
wimpy
for
the
style
imo
the
taste
is
no
surprise
it
is
a
bit
creamier
and
little
less
prickly
than
most
wheat
beers
it
has
the
big
malt
palate
with
molasses
caramel
and
semi
sweet
grainy
malts
present
the
consistency
is
a
little
heavier
than
most
wheat
beers
although
i
wouldnt
label
this
as
medium
bodied
either
there
are
some
sweetish
roasted
flavors
on
the
back
end
of
this
beer
too
but
the
molasses
does
take
precedence
here
a
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
not
bad
with
some
interesting
character
for
the
style
very
big
tan
head
cloudy
dark
brown
colour
the
aroma
is
very
clean
malts
and
hops
and
roasted
malts
too
flavour
is
roasted
a
bit
acidic
and
hoppier
than
most
german
weisses
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
medium
bubbles
to
me
this
was
a
very
good
weissbier
not
exceptional
like
weihenstephaner
but
still
very
good
and
the
nose
was
so
promising
darn
d
give
this
beer
to
me
any
time
and
ill
be
sure
to
enjoy
it
spicy
yet
sweet
and
a
very
smooth
bitterness
to
finish
off
very
well
rounded
beer
another
one
that
would
be
excellent
on
tap
but
that
isnt
available
in
my
area
at
least
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
come
across
i
highly
recommend
this
one
extremely
easy
to
drink
at
least
for
me
anyway
drinkability
relatively
drinkable
at
5
6
not
overly
complex
does
not
beg
for
you
to
drink
it
though
best
served
in
my
opinion
more
on
the
chilled
side
rather
than
just
cool
goes
well
in
a
hot
summer
night
on
the
patio
has
a
dark
opaque
brown
color
with
a
beige
thick
and
foamy
head
not
too
much
aroma
nothing
distinct
nor
strong
taste
was
also
pretty
weak
but
there
were
hints
of
a
roast
and
banana
flavors
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
much
the
highlight
of
the
beer
the
beer
itself
is
pretty
thick
and
mixed
with
the
lingering
foamy
head
it
feels
great
in
the
mouth
for
savoring
what
taste
there
actually
is
pretty
good
overall
decent
beer
that
can
be
drunk
at
anytime
just
needs
more
taste
d
really
good
beer
to
enjoy
during
or
after
a
meal
its
great
with
roasted
meats
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
etc
make
for
a
very
well
balanced
beer
t
a
thicker
tinge
but
overall
clean
experience
most
of
the
flavor
comes
towards
the
end
with
a
smokiness
and
tacky
molasses
whats
really
interesting
is
that
it
isnt
a
watered
down
feeling
when
you
drink
the
medium
to
full
body
of
this
beer
makes
you
expect
more
flavor
but
it
just
never
materializes
like
a
stripper
this
beer
has
a
great
body
to
look
at
and
feel
hell
even
spend
a
few
bucks
on
it
at
the
bar
but
there
is
no
substance
to
it
and
its
not
one
to
take
home
very
impressive
after
the
pour
huge
thick
head
that
i
had
to
let
settle
some
before
completing
the
pour
the
body
is
deep
dark
brown
with
red
highlights
and
a
bit
of
cloudiness
the
nose
is
a
bit
weak
i
get
some
dark
fruit
tones
and
a
bit
of
dark
malts
but
absent
are
any
clove
or
wheat
aromas
that
would
be
nice
the
taste
of
this
too
is
somewhat
lacking
im
not
really
getting
nearly
as
much
yeast
flavor
either
clove
or
banana
or
wheat
as
i
should
be
with
a
beer
of
this
style
it
tastes
like
a
solid
dark
beer
but
not
a
dunkel
weiss
mouthfeel
too
misses
the
mark
this
beer
is
just
too
light
and
doesnt
have
the
creamy
fullness
that
a
wheat
beer
should
have
drinkability
is
ok
but
there
are
much
better
options
in
this
style
available
and
the
lack
of
complexity
makes
this
a
bit
boring
d
good
not
interesting
but
would
be
terrific
with
food
in
conclusion
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
it
is
procedurally
correct
and
all
the
components
are
there
but
these
components
arent
top
quality
and
as
a
result
are
substantively
deficient
therefore
it
is
not
a
bad
beer
its
an
allright
beer
but
it
is
not
a
good
dunkelweizen
decent
and
rather
plainly
inoffensive
and
nowhere
near
the
fruityeast
bomb
that
i
was
expecting
its
more
akin
to
the
wellmade
but
boring
brown
ales
around
here
very
oldworld
i
suppose
as
i
always
seem
to
see
older
euro
gentleman
carrying
armfuls
of
this
stuff
to
the
tills
at
the
store
d
can
be
had
all
year
round
this
beer
tricked
me
at
first
it
pours
so
dark
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
like
a
stout
but
it
smelled
and
tasted
almost
the
same
as
the
hefe
if
i
closed
my
eyes
i
could
have
thought
it
was
an
pale
orange
color
it
was
a
little
lacking
of
the
strong
flavors
like
the
erdinger
hefe
but
it
was
still
good
i
enjoyed
the
beer
but
nothing
amazing
ps
after
writing
the
review
i
checked
some
others
to
see
where
mine
settled
in
i
see
my
score
is
a
bit
high
but
then
again
im
a
dunkelweisse
fan
so
i
shouldnt
be
surprised
at
that
i
suppose
kind
of
a
polarizing
style
ive
noticed
mfd
again
the
beer
like
the
regular
version
is
incredibly
carbonated
and
thin
though
it
is
hard
to
tell
between
viscosity
and
sheer
carbonation
bottle
has
a
best
before
date
of
07
2009
so
i
guess
im
getting
to
this
just
in
time
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
an
almost
opaque
brown
color
with
a
huge
browncream
head
the
smell
is
a
mixture
of
sweetly
roasted
malts
breadiness
spicy
yeast
and
just
a
hint
of
bananaclove
the
taste
is
much
the
same
no
flavor
is
overly
dominate
but
it
is
a
slightly
sweet
mixture
of
the
toasted
malt
bready
yeast
and
subdued
spice
the
mouthfeel
is
good
full
bodied
and
almost
chewy
carbonation
is
present
but
in
check
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
most
impressive
dunkelweizen
ive
had
nonoffensive
it
might
be
a
good
beer
for
a
bmc
drinker
to
try
as
a
gateway
beer
overall
i
liked
the
look
and
mouthfeel
to
it
the
most
the
taste
and
smell
was
good
but
very
subtle
although
i
must
say
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
tasty
brew
and
makes
me
look
forward
to
trying
more
in
this
style
d
average
this
beer
is
an
outlayer
from
all
the
other
dunkels
that
i
have
had
so
far
there
isnt
much
yeast
flavor
and
the
malt
is
what
dominates
erdinger
weissbier
dunkel
poured
a
dark
brown
much
darker
then
i
expected
almost
looked
like
a
stout
the
smell
was
faint
hints
of
bread
and
yeast
taste
was
very
full
hints
of
chocolate
but
lighter
mouthfeel
was
good
drinkability
was
ok
was
a
little
filling
overall
this
was
an
interesting
beer
i
liked
it
was
a
different
style
of
hefe
unexpectedly
pleasant
would
look
for
again
poured
into
a
weizen
glass
for
a
soapy
offwhite
onefinger
head
that
died
at
a
medium
pace
with
no
lace
on
a
cola
colored
body
a
balance
of
clove
and
citric
notes
along
with
caramel
malt
passes
for
the
aroma
mediumbodied
smooth
and
creamy
has
a
little
spicy
clove
taste
up
front
the
citric
notes
and
hop
bitterness
along
with
some
good
carbonation
mix
with
some
caramel
roasted
malts
for
a
slightly
sweet
and
citric
beer
that
is
a
little
sticky
and
has
a
dry
crisp
backbite
a
good
allaround
beer
but
there
is
nothing
outstanding
about
it
that
makes
it
great
overall
i
found
this
beer
hard
to
fault
and
i
would
not
hesitate
to
keep
a
few
of
these
around
the
house
however
that
is
likely
because
i
tend
to
favour
north
american
dark
lagers
over
german
dunkels
in
the
first
place
frankly
this
would
not
have
struck
me
as
a
dunkel
to
begin
with
or
at
least
not
very
representative
of
the
style
ordered
a
a
beautiful
halfliter
at
sunswick
3535
for
7
this
dark
brown
beer
with
its
light
tan
head
looked
ohso
promising
but
fell
flat
once
i
started
sipping
sure
the
carbonation
was
fine
but
it
only
tasted
like
a
creamed
wheat
or
oatmeal
cereal
with
a
hint
of
cocoa
powder
overall
a
fine
example
of
the
still
good
but
not
the
best
in
class
mouthfeel
is
smooth
creamy
and
mediumplus
bodied
overall
a
very
nice
drinkable
dark
wheat
beer
i
could
enjoy
this
on
a
regular
basis
fat
drunk
and
stupid
is
no
way
to
go
through
life
so
drink
this
beer
unless
like
fred
dorfman
your
a
closet
case
otherwise
a
pretty
good
beer
drinkability
as
with
all
german
low
abv
brews
i
could
drink
these
all
day
with
ease
german
beer
drinkability
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
overall
im
surprised
at
how
good
this
dunkel
weizen
turned
out
since
their
regular
weissbier
is
somewhat
average
to
most
people
pours
medium
to
light
brown
with
offwhite
head
nose
is
somewhat
tame
compared
to
other
hefeweizens
ive
sampled
recently
whether
dunkel
or
not
palate
offers
a
medium
malty
flavor
with
brown
bread
light
baking
spices
and
a
faint
suggestion
of
cookie
dough
finish
is
medium
short
with
more
cookie
dough
drinkability
while
not
much
more
complex
than
the
weissbier
from
erdinger
this
dunkel
is
fine
and
i
could
have
more
both
now
and
sometime
again
man
this
is
one
tasty
beer
dark
chocolate
flavors
are
in
the
forefront
with
a
bit
of
banana
esters
in
mid
palate
with
a
nice
crisp
wheat
tang
on
the
finish
it
is
a
bit
mild
mannered
compared
to
others
of
the
style
but
extreme
is
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
a
german
wheat
beer
i
like
the
lively
carbonation
it
provides
with
a
careful
pour
this
is
one
of
the
better
dunkelweizens
i
have
had
and
i
will
definitely
be
buying
more
of
it
highly
recommended
it
is
what
it
is
dark
brown
with
a
tan
rocky
head
not
as
much
on
the
nose
as
i
was
hoping
even
after
it
warmed
up
a
bit
touch
of
cocoa
coffee
with
just
a
dab
of
fruity
esters
in
the
background
drinks
super
smooth
and
a
little
creamy
even
not
bad
but
i
just
expected
a
little
more
500ml
bottle
with
a
best
by
date
of
october
2009
nice
dark
brown
color
small
head
smells
decent
and
malty
but
not
much
like
a
hefe
the
flavor
is
nice
and
malty
but
i
get
no
clove
or
bubblegum
nor
banana
that
i
usually
get
from
a
hefeweissen
i
need
to
drink
more
dunkelweizens
to
get
a
good
feel
for
the
style
drinkability
havent
had
very
many
of
this
style
quite
nice
and
enjoyable
d
not
as
drinkable
as
erdingers
other
brews
but
good
one
is
enough
id
rather
order
a
bunch
of
erdinger
kristallklar
instead
a
pretty
average
dunkel
drinks
ok
but
there
are
such
better
versions
out
there
that
this
wont
be
spending
any
time
in
my
fridge
conclusion
nice
clean
simple
tasty
smooth
full
of
dark
fruit
not
quite
what
i
was
expecting
but
super
tasty
nonetheless
500ml
bottle
pours
a
very
dark
muddy
brown
with
a
fluffy
tan
head
that
drops
quickly
smell
is
tart
wheat
and
some
very
faint
chocolate
and
a
bit
of
banana
slightly
tart
taste
with
a
roasted
character
and
very
faint
fruits
metallic
dry
finish
thin
feel
with
moderate
carbonation
pretty
mediocre
i
am
very
pleased
with
erdinger
weissbier
dunkel
as
others
have
noted
this
is
mildly
surprising
as
their
standard
hefeweizen
at
least
the
way
it
turns
out
after
being
bottled
and
imported
into
the
us
really
isnt
stellar

finest
offering
stateside
at
least
i
strongly
strongly
recommend
this
beer
to
any
fan
of
hefeweizens
doppelbocks
andor
weizenbocks
pours
a
dark
reddish
colored
body
brownish
head
creamy
lasting
and
pretty
big
malty
somewhat
banany
aroma
grapey
not
too
strong
an
aroma
somewhat
banana
dusty
taste
more
body
than
a
hefeweizen
nutty
not
bad
no
off
flavors
here
but
could
be
more
robust
this
brew
has
a
lighter
flavor
profile
than
some
hefes
but
certainly
drinkable
dnot
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
it
could
be
much
better
the
drinkability
is
rather
low
courtesy
of
the
high
carbonation
it
would
be
difficult
to
have
a
few
of
these
in
a
row
it
is
very
good
i
think
it
might
be
too
strong
to
be
a
session
beer
but
the
other
characteristics
make
it
close
part
of
an
erdinger
gift
set
served
in
a
tall
weizen
glass
chocolate
brown
color
with
a
tremendous
tan
head
minimal
aroma
mix
of
malt
and
banana
taste
is
pleasant
if
fairly
mild
a
little
banana
perhaps
a
little
less
complex
than
i
prefer
relatively
easy
drinking
brew
final
final
note
i
debated
buying
this
bottle
as
i
actually
despise
their
normal
hefeweizen
i
closed
my
eyes
and
bought
it
then
avoided
opening
it
for
about
a
month
these
two
beers
are
worlds
appart
and
i
wish
i
had
tried
this
sooner
a
complete
surprise
dnot
very
drinkable
turns
flat
after
15
to
20
mintunes
not
very
good
at
all
d
disappointing
overall
to
me
im
certainly
glad
i
was
able
to
try
it
but
theres
not
enough
going
on
here
to
make
me
want
another
there
are
much
more
complex
choices
in
this
style
out
there
overall
if
i
could
get
a
six
at
cheaper
price
than
i
pay
per
16
9
oz
bottle
id
buy
it
more
right
now
its
a
buy
when
i
dont
have
the
cash
for
a
better
dark
hefedunkel
overall
a
decent
dunkelweiss
but
its
a
little
tame
in
the
nose
and
taste
bottle
poured
a
clear
dark
dunkel
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
roasted
malt
with
light
caramel
and
light
banana
aftertaste
taste
is
mostly
dominated
by
some
roasted
malt
with
a
light
bitter
finish
and
some
light
fruity
notes
also
noticeable
average
body
with
good
carbonation
ok
but
again
a
style
that
really
doesnt
appeal
to
me
that
much
mouthfeel
is
ok
despite
the
high
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
passable
but
what
a
boring
beer
a
huge
billowing
light
tan
head
three
fingers
deep
color
is
a
dark
brown
nice
aroma
of
banana
and
some
clove
but
mostly
banana
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
smell
mouthfeel
was
weak
some
malt
and
fruitiness
in
the
flavor
somewhat
chocolatey
high
co2
overall
decent
but
simple
and
lacking
real
umph
poured
an
attractive
dark
brown
that
was
nearly
black
with
a
generous
tan
head
that
lasted
a
while
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
fruit
chocolate
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
smell
and
i
think
the
chocolate
intensified
a
bit
as
the
beer
got
warmer
the
mouthfeel
was
pleasant
this
was
a
good
beer
with
good
drinkability
d
not
bad
but
not
great
doesnt
have
much
moreishness
this
could
maybe
pass
as
an
american
dark
lager
but
not
a
true
german
dunkel
it
may
be
dark
but
it
is
far
from
spicy
fruity
malty
or
refreshing
a
real
dunkelweizen
should
posses
all
the
zesty
yeast
and
citrusy
wheat
character
of
a
hefeweizen
and
all
the
heavy
malty
caramel
richness
of
a
dunkel
hence
the
damn
name
but
this
fails
at
both
ends
of
its
title
a
nice
drinkable
dunkel
very
simple
and
straightforward
but
pleasant
and
refreshing
making
it
an
easy
drinker
its
definitely
not
exceptional
in
the
field
but
i
would
consider
it
again
a
nice
16
9oz
bottle
at
propwer
temperature
poured
out
a
rich
deep
dark
brown
with
a
mild
roasted
malt
and
citrus
aroma
the
head
was
minimal
but
had
retention
and
the
flavor
was
maltroasted
with
slight
citrus
wheat
but
not
grassy
or
hempish
there
was
a
nice
hazelnut
undertone
and
though
there
was
good
thick
body
it
still
ultimately
was
light
in
drinkability
and
delicious
more
please
easily
drinkable
beer
low
abv
good
taste
and
good
mouthfeel
make
sure
of
that
drinkability
would
be
great
but
its
just
a
little
too
sugary
for
my
taste
to
drink
too
many
this
is
a
nice
looking
dark
beer
the
coudy
hefe
body
lends
to
a
think
looking
dark
beer
the
head
is
off
white
and
one
of
the
creamest
and
lingering
heads
i
have
seen
the
lace
on
the
glass
just
doesnt
go
away
i
was
expecting
to
get
more
from
the
smell
but
all
i
get
is
a
typical
lightly
fruity
fresh
hefe
smell
the
taste
is
very
very
smoth
and
balanced
the
darker
malt
lends
to
a
great
balance
the
hefe
yeast
still
contributes
its
fruity
esters
not
as
much
banana
flavor
as
other
breweries
and
a
crisp
clean
finish
is
classic
beeing
a
hefe
the
mouthfeel
is
solid
but
erdinger
has
the
thickest
mouth
feel
i
think
some
of
it
has
to
do
with
the
release
of
the
carbonation
when
you
drink
it
so
bubbles
froth
in
your
mouth
due
to
the
balanced
flavor
and
overall
light
crisp
and
refreshing
nature
of
this
beer
and
style
this
is
for
sure
a
full
on
session
beer
this
pours
a
dark
brown
with
a
two
finger
head
which
disappears
the
nose
is
dominated
by
toasted
malts
and
dark
fruit
a
wonderful
creamy
mouthfeel
the
palate
is
bananas
and
some
light
chocolate
a
bit
of
spiciness
gives
it
a
bit
of
zing
and
provides
some
length
not
a
good
first
impression
of
this
brewery
a
nice
mouthfeel
its
certainly
an
easy
drinker
beer
a
sessionable
wheat
beer
the
kind
that
erdinger
excels
at
nice
but
look
elsewhere
for
complexity
drinkability
there
is
nothing
offensive
about
this
beer
but
i
would
definitely
prefer
a
different
wheat
beer
poured
from
500ml
bottle
a
translucent
dark
brown
with
light
tan
head
no
retention
spotty
lacing
smell
dark
fruit
prunes
maybe
fig
no
banana
wheat
and
a
touch
of
astringency
alcohol
taste
wheat
dark
fruit
caramel
chocolate
and
a
bananaesque
softness
but
without
the
banana
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
hardwater
feel
a
little
too
effervescent
for
the
style
its
there
and
gone
with
not
much
to
remember
it
by
its
immediately
recognizable
as
an
erdinger
maybe
its
their
yeast
this
was
enjoyable
but
doesnt
rate
with
the
top
german
dunkelweizens
d
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
like
most
bavarian
wheats
it
would
be
a
great
pair
with
classically
german
meal
as
soon
as
i
opened
the
bottle
i
noticed
the
bread
like
aroma
with
yeast
tones
it
was
not
as
malty
as
one
might
imagine
or
as
their
other
beers
for
that
matter
it
is
a
very
foamy
beer
with
lots
of
head
and
lace
the
body
is
dark
almost
cola
looking
with
a
very
dark
amber
hue
it
has
very
bread
like
taste
and
is
not
as
roasty
as
most
dunkels
it
is
very
balanced
though
the
malt
and
the
hops
equally
each
other
out
well
the
mouthfeel
is
egg
like
and
slick
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
goes
well
with
food
drinkability
not
too
heavy
relatively
low
abv
etc
not
that
bad
really
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
ive
had
better
dunkelweizens
though
franziskaner
comes
to
mind
or
weihenstephaner
this
ones
a
good
pick
though
id
pick
the
other
two
over
this
but
i
wont
avoid
it
either
this
beer
is
ok
but
lacks
any
wow
factor
not
bad
but
pretty
average
i
expected
more
especially
from
the
nice
look
of
the
initial
pour
of
the
brew
but
its
not
a
bad
hefeweizen
just
not
one
that
i
would
buy
too
often
or
at
all
if
there
are
other
choices
around
this
is
now
my
second
bottle
in
two
months
and
i
dont
feel
the
need
to
try
another
one
but
maybe
if
i
see
it
on
tap
pours
a
dark
brown
with
reddish
highlights
smell
is
of
wheat
and
molassas
taste
is
malty
with
hints
of
chocolate
and
a
slight
wheat
twang
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
carbonation
high
quite
drinkable
though
a
smooth
drinking
beer
i
would
drink
again
d
one
of
those
beers
that
just
disappears
from
your
glass
it
goes
down
so
easy
that
being
said
i
was
really
looking
for
a
stronger
more
complex
flavor
d
i
found
myself
disappointed
by
this
offering
i
have
had
some
delicious
beer
from
erdinger
and
this
did
not
match
my
expectations
it
was
drinkable
since
it
remained
extremely
light
throughout
the
glass
but
it
lacked
a
certain
complexity
that
i
wanted
from
this
dunkelweiss
it
is
worth
trying
especially
is
you
wanted
to
pair
it
with
a
plate
of
grilled
chicken
when
poured
into
a
erdinger
weizen
glass
this
dunkelweizen
was
an
appealing
murky
dark
chestnut
brown
with
some
caramel
coloring
mixed
in
with
it
usually
weizens
have
a
massive
head
of
foam
on
it
but
the
one
on
this
beer
was
more
controlled
it
was
about
1
12
inches
in
height
and
was
an
off
white
color
this
head
of
foam
quickly
fizzled
away
and
only
left
behind
a
handful
of
fizzy
off
white
colored
rings
i
liked
the
color
but
the
head
of
foam
needed
a
little
something
this
beer
needs
to
be
swirled
around
to
wake
up
the
aroma
when
it
was
the
aroam
was
still
very
subtle
with
dark
roasted
wheat
a
splash
of
sweet
caramel
and
a
hint
of
banana
and
cloves
to
me
the
aroma
needed
more
malted
wheat
and
banana
and
it
shouldnt
have
to
be
swirled
around
to
get
any
kind
of
smell
out
of
it
the
taste
was
very
crispy
and
carbonated
with
plenty
of
dark
roasted
wheat
a
hint
of
banana
a
pinch
of
cloves
and
then
finishes
up
with
more
malted
wheat
it
is
a
weizen
but
there
should
have
been
a
little
bit
more
flavor
in
here
wheat
can
get
a
little
boring
by
itself
this
was
a
light
bodied
beer
that
was
heavy
on
the
carbonation
and
featured
a
faint
aftertaste
of
dark
roasted
wheat
and
a
hint
of
cloves
no
banana
just
wheat
and
cloves
it
wouldnt
be
so
bad
if
they
lowerd
the
carbonation
so
i
could
get
more
of
an
aftertaste
out
of
this
beer
in
the
end
this
weizen
was
overly
carbonated
with
a
ton
of
malted
wheat
and
really
nothing
else
there
are
better
german
or
american
dunkelweizens
out
there
i
will
continue
to
use
the
glass
with
the
erdinger
name
on
it
but
i
wont
be
pouring
this
beer
into
it
any
time
soon
overall
a
nice
dunkel
dark
brew
with
large
foamy
head
that
stays
around
alcoholic
scent
coming
through
the
open
medicine
cabinet
with
some
roasted
nuts
laying
around
a
bit
malty
taste
light
carbonation
zing
with
a
touch
of
chocolate
grain
makes
for
a
beer
that
sits
well
on
the
palate
and
easy
on
the
stomach
a
great
balance
of
a
light
bodied
beer
that
has
characteristics
of
a
dark
heavy
bodied
one
in
the
mouth
it
feels
maybe
just
a
little
too
thin
for
my
full
bodied
tastes
but
just
a
tad
the
carbonation
is
mild
to
medium
allinall
this
is
a
crisp
refreshing
dunkel
about
on
par
with
franziskaner
but
not
as
good
as
weihenstephaner
d
can
be
difficult
to
drink
due
to
the
carbonation
similar
to
the
hefe
from
this
brewery
im
just
not
getting
much
compared
to
the
real
good
weisse
beers
out
there
this
one
just
screams
average
d
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
but
not
what
i
have
in
mind
for
this
style
i
didnt
detect
the
characteristic
banana
or
spiciness
this
is
light
mild
and
drinkablenonetheless
overall
a
nice
change
from
a
hefe
sort
of
on
the
way
towards
a
weizenbock
the
brew
pours
a
deep
brown
almost
rusty
color
with
lots
of
haze
and
a
huge
and
healthy
beigetan
head
that
leaves
lots
of
sticking
on
a
5l
erdinger
weiss
glass
the
nose
emits
aromas
of
toasted
wheat
apple
and
a
subtle
chocolate
malty
sweetness
its
flavor
drops
off
rather
quick
while
tasting
hints
of
spice
some
detectable
hop
twang
mid
palate
and
on
the
finish
some
metallic
funk
notes
oats
and
definite
notes
of
banana
lots
of
active
carbonation
through
out
the
bottle
light
body
and
extremely
drinkable
a
very
enjoyable
brew
drinkable
and
a
nice
changeup
from
the
standard
weissbier
d
nothing
that
makes
it
really
special
but
beer
is
drinkable
maybe
due
to
5
6
abv
newly
stocked
item
at
a
local
store
picked
up
a
single
even
with
the
glass
tilted
an
enormous
fluffy
head
sat
atop
a
dark
cola
colored
beer
after
a
few
minutes
the
head
settled
and
a
nice
looking
glass
of
beer
sat
in
front
of
me
nice
and
aromatic
sweet
yeasty
scents
are
easily
detected
this
one
is
definitely
different
from
the
other
hefe
and
dunkelweizens
where
as
it
doesnt
seem
to
contain
a
large
presence
of
banana
and
clove
esters
although
unique
it
is
still
very
appealing
mouthfeel
is
better
than
average
very
smooth
but
somewhat
dry
flavor
is
good
and
surprisingly
mellow
for
this
style
seems
balanced
and
the
sweetness
from
the
aroma
carries
through
not
the
best
ive
sampled
but
well
worth
picking
up
wheat
beers
are
good
to
drink
for
breakfast
but
if
you
want
liquid
apple
strudel
flavor
over
liquid
banana
bread
grab
this
beer
i
poured
a
16
9oz
bottle
into
my
smokestack
goblet
this
beer
pours
as
dark
brown
as
a
ale
can
get
when
held
away
from
the
light
it
looks
completely
entirely
black
it
also
pours
a
nice
2
finger
beige
head
the
aroma
of
this
beer
is
as
unoriginal
as
you
think
a
german
brewery
could
do
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
up
front
in
the
middle
and
at
the
end
the
taste
is
as
uninventive
as
the
ford
taurus
once
again
hello
sweet
malts
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
mild
carbonation
wow
i
really
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
beer
erdinger
makes
wonderful
wheat
beers
why
would
they
allow
this
beer
to
be
put
out
to
market
and
be
so
average
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
good
beer
i
must
say
that
after
the
nice
appearance
and
a
good
first
impression
it
actually
ends
in
something
of
a
disappointment
medium
bodied
crisp
clean
but
still
smooth
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
dunkleweizens
and
one
of
the
first
good
german
beers
that
i
tried
as
i
was
moving
away
from
macros
though
this
is
more
than
a
gateway
beer
something
i
still
enjoy
years
after
my
first
try
looks
like
a
good
dunkle
nice
cloudy
dark
color
with
an
off
white
rocky
head
that
fades
to
lacing
thats
pretty
much
where
the
good
dunkle
thing
ends
isnt
it
the
aroma
isnt
spectacular
by
any
means
little
bit
of
maltiness
maybe
some
fruit
esters
buy
not
much
the
taste
is
much
the
same
fruit
little
wheat
not
a
lot
else
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
decent
a
bit
of
maltiness
that
isnt
overshadowed
by
the
carbonation
drinkability
not
great
not
bad
ill
try
it
again
on
the
offchance
i
got
a
bad
bottle
erdinger
normally
puts
out
a
pretty
good
brew
all
in
all
a
pleasurable
drinking
experience
and
a
fantastic
diversion
from
the
actual
work
i
should
be
doing
metrical
analysis
of
beowulf
theres
a
reason
i
need
a
beer
break
i
have
to
say
i
liked
the
dunkel
much
better
than
the
hefewiess
in
this
case
poured
it
into
my
duvel
chalice
had
a
nice
cloudy
brownish
color
smelled
was
malty
a
little
yeast
hint
a

down

hooray
for
dunkels
a

you
can
first
taste
the
toasted

then
caramel

very

is

for
a
500ml
bottle
from
capitol
convenience
concord
nh
poured
a
half
glass
of
creamy
light
brown
colored
head
that
faded
faster
then
normal
hazy
cola
colored
beer
has
an
amber
hue
around
the
edges
smells
of
raisin
and
cocoa
with
spoon
full
of
yeast
the
flavor
is
rich
and
has
hints
of
rum
and
raisins
under
then
doughy
dark
malt
base
the
flavors
remind
me
of
something
stronger
like
a
weizenbock
which
is
nice
because
there
is
something
freaky
about
a
dark
weizen
beer
that
tastes
exactly
like
a
pale
weizen
the
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
fizzy
and
not
as
smooth
and
full
as
i
was
expecting
but
its
not
a
deal
killer
its
definitely
my
type
of
dunkelweizen
some
other
dunkels
just
a
delightful
beer
even
as
i
review
it
today
its
making
me
want
another
glass
right
now
just
delicious
stuff
maybe
im
just
not
as
big
a
fan
of
dunkelweizen
as
i
am
with
regular
pale
hefes
i
cant
drink
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
still
for
erdinger
actually
a
better
choice
than
their
regular
weiss
this
one
pours
a
dark
muddywater
brown
with
some
red
highlights
and
a
pretty
big
very
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
light
with
some
fruitiness
and
a
touch
of
spice
taste
is
light
as
well
toasted
and
wheaty
grains
mostly
with
a
bit
of
earthiness
to
it
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
but
unspectacular
feeling
in
the
mouthfeel
not
very
impressive
overall
quite
a
good
beer
which
could
become
a
truly
great
beer
with
a
bit
of
improvement
in
the
brewhouse
a
huge
fluffy
light
tan
head
sits
atop
a
dark
brown
brew
smells
of
banana
citrus
coriander
and
a
bit
of
pine
the
taste
does
not
live
up
to
the
promise
of
the
smell
a
dull
intro
is
followed
up
by
malts
mixed
with
faint
bananas
and
a
bit
of
spice
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
lightbodied
carbonation
is
fairly
active
not
my
favorite
by
any
means
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
drinkability
at
5
6
i
could
drink
this
one
now
and
then
but
the
mouthfeel
being
so
overly
carbonated
makes
lowers
the
drinkability
mfd
thin
and
watery
with
a
hint
of
alcohol
warmness
this
beer
is
drinkable
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
it
other
german
counterparts
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
there
are
much
better
examples
of
this
style
out
there
this
beer
is
very
dark
which
sets
it
apart
from
a
lot
of
other
hefeweizens
palate
is
as
expected
in
a
wheat
beer
exquisitely
smooth
and
drinkable
pours
a
cloudy
dark
brown
slightly
translucent
with
massive
offwhite
tan
head
aromas
are
really
muted
with
very
little
phenols
present
no
spice
no
citrus
what
i
get
is
mostly
caramel
and
toasted
bread
from
the
darker
malts
on
the
palate
more
of
the
same
there
are
some
banana
flavors
but
still
no
clove
just
a
fair
melanoidin
character
i
dont
know
if
my
sample
is
just
too
cold
but
not
much
of
anything
is
coming
off
this
beer
there
is
a
nice
malty
tart
finish
though
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
high
carbonation
not
quite
as
high
as
a
heffe
and
also
with
a
slight
stinging
feel
overall
this
is
a
soso
dunkel
verdict
a
drinkable
dunkelweizen
i
dont
really
notice
anything
that
sets
it
apart
but
its
smooth
it
goes
down
well
and
that
counts
for
something
d
a
good
drinker
could
have
quite
a
few
of
these
d
this
is
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
goes
down
very
smooth
it
looks
dark
but
there
is
not
mistaking
that
it
is
wheat
the
taste
is
ok
but
not
much
complexity
some
malt
a
little
dark
tasting
nice
caramel
addition
to
the
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
very
good
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
traditional
bavarian
sturzl
this
puppy
had
a
nice
big
soft
foamy
head
that
slowly
dissapated
but
did
not
dissapear
completely
they
put
a
decent
amount
of
munich
malt
into
this
one
i
really
like
munich
malt
and
that
characteristic
malty
carmel
flavor
with
almost
no
sweetness
however
i
detected
absolutely
no
hefeweizen
characteristics
no
wheaty
tang
no
clove
no
banana
oh
well
i
love
dunkels
and
i
enjoyed
this
beer
d
nice
in
all
it
is
easily
quaffable
i
could
make
a
night
of
this
brew
and
not
get
bored
once
if
you
see
one
of
these
pick
it
up
recommended
poured
into
a
wine
goblet
resulting
in
a
two
finger
head
that
settled
down
with
some
mild
lacing
color
a
medium
coffee
intensity
just
shy
of
guinness
darkness
aroma
is
of
malt
and
alcohol
esters
with
less
wheat
than
one
might
expect
especially
compared
to
its
competitor
from
spaten
malt
and
fizziness
dominate
the
taste
sensation
with
bits
of
dried
dark
fruit
and
very
little
wheat
taste
apparent
great
mouthfeel
with
notable
carbonation
the
spaten
is
eminently
drinkable
but
this
might
be
even
more
so
overall
nice
dunkel
weizen
not
top
of
the
notch
but
very
interesting
and
quite
enjoyable
appearance
is
a
dark
brown
with
a
thick
off
white
fluffy
head
smell
is
light
wheat
mostly
malt
fruity
taste
is
heavier
in
malt
with
a
hint
of
coffee
not
alot
of
charactor
mouthfeel
is
light
medium
with
good
carbonation
a
good
beer
but
not
great
i
dont
think
ill
run
out
any
time
soon
to
grab
another
mouthfeel

bodied
high
carbonation

i
downed

bottles
with
my
pork
chops
and
sauerkraut

potato
cakes
at
the
edelweiss
restaurant
in
greenwood
fuhrer
num
num
i
personally
enjoyed
this
up
to
a
point
it
become
a
bit
boring
in
the
longrun
pfft
pours
with
a
nice
finger
of
head
which
settles
to
half
that
in
about
10
seconds
pours
a
deep
rich
dark
brown
almost
black
hold
it
to
the
light
and
there
are
caramelred
highlights
a
plenty
smell
is
weak
as
expected
for
the
style
but
you
pick
up
notes
of
caramel
and
hop
taste
is
where
the
hops
come
out
of
the
woodwork
hops
are
the
first
thing
you
notice
after
the
medium
carbonation
the
hops
settle
out
with
the
bubbles
and
youre
left
with
milder
hops
and
sweet
caramel
aftertaste
carbonation
is
good
a
bit
of
a
bite
but
not
overdone
drinkability
is
good
but
there
is
a
bit
of
carbonation
to
process
not
to
overstate
the
carbonation
but
letting
it
sit
for
15
minutes
helps
poured
from
a
bottle
this
attribute
is
more
noticeable
but
i
expect
if
you
got
this
in
germany
it
would
be
in
a
bigger
glass
than
16oz
and
therefore
would
have
time
to
breathe
alcohol
content
is

5
according
to
the
label
would
have
uploaded
a

but
i
see
one
is
already
awaiting
review
not
bad
but
i
like
the
lighter
hefes
better
nice
to
try
but
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
try
again
tastes
of
sweet

dark

chocolate
spicy
hops

i
enjoy
this
dunkel

it
is
lacking
in
some
areas
dabiliy

cold

almost
lagerlike

i
will
be

the

with
an

it
smells
like
roasted
malt
wheat
and
a
little
bit
of
chocolate
taste
is
similar
to
the

theres
also
a

with

the
carbonation
hurts
the
drinkability
a
bit
but
its
not
hard
to
drink
overall
i
think
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
it
seems
like
something
is
missing
from
it
lowering
the
carbonation
would
definintely
help
malty
nose
low
hops
with
almost
no
aroma
which
is
par
for
style
smooth
beer
with
rich
mouthfeel
a
taste
of
roasted
malts
lingers
in
your
mouth
at
the
end
pours
dark
with
a
large
tan
head
that
subsides
quickly
i
usually
dont
like
hefes
but
i
would
drink
this
one
again
i
went
on
a
dark
heavy
weezin
trip
today
for
some
reason
this
one
was
1
on
deck
pours
a
dark
slightly
cloudy
ruddybrown
w
a
fluffy
tan
head
which
dissapated
rather
quickly
may
have
been
the
glass
tho
left
a
moderate
lacing
not
a
strong
aroma
at
all
a
faint
hint
of
some
wheaty
yeast
esters
a
little
fruitiness
to
it
bannana
maybe
some
hop
spiciness
metallic
aroma
too
a
thin
almost
watery
flavor
you
can
taste
some
darker
malts
and
hops
in
a
euro
macro
base
not
much
wheatiness
to
it
kinda
metallic
aftertaste
as
well
a
good
mouthfeel
true
to
style
light
w
lots
of
bubbles
sticks
to
your
tounge
just
right
this
is
a
drinkable
one
but
i
feel
its
not
really
weezy
enough
d
this
is
the
second
bottle
that
i
have
had
and
both
have
suffered
from
pretty
strong
metallic
flavors
which
made
the
beer
a
little
harder
to
enjoy
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
ok
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
it
overall
ill
probably
have
it
again
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
a
dark
hef
but
it
probably
wouldnt
be
top
on
the
list
drinkability
i
was
expecting
a
hefeand
if
you
are
dont
drink
this
beer
because
it
is
not
a
hefe
but
it
rather
enjoyable
a
nice
mild
beer
that
goes
down
easy
comment
i
enjoyed
it
but
it
did
little
to
entice
me
to
become
a
regular
drinkability
excellent
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
night
drinkability
goes
down
wonderfully
again
if
you
view
this
as
a
dark
beer
with
wheat
hints
it
is
as
original
as
it
comes
poured
into
a
wheat
glass
pours
a
dark
black
color
with
a
fluffy
3
finger
head
that
stays
around
the
entire
drink
looks
like
a
russian
imperial
stout
smell
is
a
bit
of
a
weedy
citrus
smell
with
a
roasted
malt
in
the
mix
as
well
this
beer
is
not
to
flavorful
i
can
detect
a
bit
of
citrus
and
also
a
bit
of
lemon
as
well
this
beer
did
go
down
quickly
and
pretty
smooth
good
for
a
summer
day
but
kind
of
weird
drinking
a
dark
hefe
over
all
not
to
bad
and
one
i
would
probably
have
again
malts
which
was
very
delicious
yeast
was
also
clear
in
the
taste
some
spices
are
in
the
package
too
but
the
usual
weizen
banana
taste
is
lighter
on
the
dark
version
probably
because
of
a
stronger
dark
wheat
malt
taste
a
rather
enjoyable
taste
and
also
with
some
wheat
malt
and
yeast
aromas
on
the
nose
the
finish
was
very
slightly
bitter
and
going
into
the
after
taste
it
was
malty
wheaty
as
expected
but
as
it
lingers
a
little
it
becomes
a
little
fruity
plummy
like
belgian
dark
ales
and
i
could
sense
some
breadiness
and
bananas
on
the
nose
some
spices
was
detected
in
the
after
taste
as
well
it
finally
fades
off
to
leave
a
light
grape
citrus
finale
not
too
shabby
the
mouthfeel
was
around
medium
body
with
a
intense
carbonation
which
was
at
first
pretty
stinging
the
smoothness
and
refreshing
nature
was
however
very
well
crafted
as
expected
in
weizen
beers
a
very
enjoyable
refreshing
tasty
beer
indeed
i
definitely
prefer
this
to
the
non
dark
default
version
of
the
erdinger
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
beer
is
over
carbonated
so
much
so
that
it
interferes
with
the
flavor
of
the
brew
carbonation
is
sharp
and
quickly
foams
up
in
the
mouth
however
the
bottle
couldve
been
infected
but
still
as
to
drinkability
i
will
not
be
buying
this
beer
again
it
just
plain
sucks
overall
it
has
no
redeeming
qualities
i
wont
say
avoid
it
but
i
will
caution
the
buyercaveat
emptor
this
is
a
poor
brew
not
only
stylistically
but
all
around
poor
appearance
poor
taste
poor
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
well
ill
never
buy
it
again
d
goes
down
fairly
easily
with
very
little
banana
presence
its
a
better
fit
for
me
than
most
weissbiers
taste
is
light
wheat
and
weizen
taste
bananas
and
clove
are
almost
not
present
the
chocolate
and
roastedburned
notes
are
present
and
let
the
beers
balance
lean
the
total
opposite
of
a
normal
weizen
nothing
phenolic
but
more
caramel
the
yeast
also
seems
to
differ
from
a
standard
weizen
yeast
aftertaste
is
dry
and
light
chocolate
good
beer
but
not
what
i
expected
poured
from
a
bottle
dated
12008
as
others
have
said
the
beer
poured
nice
big
thick
head
nice
dark
red
color
but
the
taste
really
was
a
downer
to
me
this
doesnt
even
taste
like
a
hefeweiss
there
are
no
pronounced
characteristics
of
the
wheat
at
all
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
not
a
good
example
of
what
it
should
be
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
but
i
wouldnt
order
it
over
other
weiss
beers
if
given
the
choice
pours
a
dark
cloudy
brown
color
with
plenty
of
creamy
tan
head
that
just
wont
go
away
smells
of
yeast
and
fruity
some
plum
and
raisin
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
also
fruity
some
plums
and
also
a
small
amount
of
chocolate
theres
also
a
yeasty
flavor
through
it
the
mouthfeel
is
very
fizzy
and
scraping
on
the
tongue
and
a
little
heavy
just
like
a
wheat
should
be
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
brew
i
just
wish
i
could
afford
to
get
it
all
the
time
a
nice
dark
reddishbrown
with
a
decent
tan
head
aroma
is
malty
but
a
touch
of
sour
too
it
is
very
smooth
going
down
but
does
leave
a
bitter
charcoal
taste
pretty
nice
not
overly
carbonated
quite
drinkable
but
not
quite
as
impressive
as
i
expected
on
tap
definitely
worth
a
try
but
not
one
i
would
hang
my
hat
on
overall
its
good
a
good
dark
wheat
flavor
which
is
one
of
my
favorite
grain
flavors
but
nothing
extraordinary
overly
carbonated
and
generally
light
flavors
make
this
a
good
session
beer
but
nothing
to
marvel
about
d
excellent
its
almost
perfectly
sessionable
the
only
thing
i
didnt
like
is
its
weak
nose
and
light
flavors
it
just
needs
kicked
up
a
notch
yet
another
decent
dunkel
in
manitobas
liqour
stores
this
is
a
very
dark
deep
take
on
the
style
with
a
lot
to
explore
when
the
beer
warms
more
caramel
than
banana
this
beer
shows
real
legs
on
the
finish
with
a
semi
sweet
exit
i
will
certainly
buy
this
again
when
i
see
it
as
it
often
difficult
to
get
a
dunkel
as
nice
as
this
d
this
is
a
very
good
dunkel
another
good
german
brew
a
decent
dunkel
weizen
though
ive
had
better
of
style
from
bavariia
its
wellwithin
freshness
date
but
slight
oxidation
and
blandness
make
me
wonder
how
well
this
one
held
up
in
transit
interesting
variation
on
wheat
beer
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
really
liked
this
one
will
certainly
be
trying
again
the
beer
pours
very
dark
brown
with
a
frothy
tan
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
it
has
a
light
smell
of
caramel
that
is

this
is

dunkels
d
yes
would
order
again
salud
the

is
ok
maybe
good
as
well
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
it
looks
awesome

slides
from
there
mk
beaut
looking
beer
with
a
big
creamy
head
deep
and
dark
colour
like
black
assam
tea
a
slight
doughy

nothing

apparent
the
flavour
is
pretty
subdued
but
wheaty
with
faint
dark
chocolate
notes
my
wife
just
says
molasses
but
she
doesnt
like
dark
beer
although
she
has
an
excellent
nose
and
palate
i
agree
with
other
reviewers
that
its
a
bit
watery
but
i
think
this
may
be
a
saving
grace
in
terms
of
drinkability
i
like
this
beer
and
if
it
werent
for
the
price
it
would
be
a
session
beer
for
me
sure
its
not
overly
complex
but
its
a
medium
body
dark
with
nice
wheaty
flavours
and
creamy
drinkability
nice
d
a
quaffable
brew
that
goes
down
easy
i
would
probably
hestitate
to
drink
more
than
one
though
since
it
is
more
carbonated
than
i
would
prefer
this
is

tried
with

by

overall
pretty
underwhelming
not
sure
if
i
got
a

definitely
warrants
a
second
try
this
is
okay
but
only
okay
largely
bland
and
unexciting
when
it
comes
to
dunkel
weizens
julius
echter
and
franziskaner
far
outclass
this
hohum
offering
a
tasty
and
refreshing
beer
very
drinkable
and
would
serve
as
a
good
intro
to
brews
using
roasted
barley
or
would
make
a
nice
refreshing
beer
in
the
dog
days
of
summer
to
give
one
their
fix
of
roasted
barley
glad
i
got
to
try
this
one
i
will
not
be
rushing
out
and
buying
a
crate
of
this
but
if
i
ever
see
it
on
tap
anywhere
i
will
give
it
another
try
mouthfeel
is
thin
carbonation
is
noticeable
does
not
lend
itself
to
big
gulps
like
the
je
and
the
franz
not
terrible
just
not
great
drinkability
would
be
fine
if
i
could
get
past
the
taste
but
i
cant
this
stood
out
significantly
on
the
downside
from
the

3
dunkels
i
will
not
buy
this
again
drinkability
is
good
alcohol
is
hidden
well
tasty
pleasant
medium

very
easy
to
drink
good
beer
but
aventinus
delivers
a
lot
more
this
beer
is
definitely
worth
a
revisit
at
some
point
d
not
bad
but
somehow
its
a
heavier
beer
with
lighter
flavour
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
dunkel
weizen
a
refreshing
tonic
of
a
dark
brew
notes
im
on
a
bit
of
a
bad
streak
sometimes
you
need
to
go
back
to
the
tried
and
true
to
get
some
perspective
this
didnt
do
it
for
me
and
for
now
im
going
back
to
proven
winners
only
for
a
while
pours
a
clear
brown
color
nice
carbonation
huge
head
lots
of
lacing
afterwards
scents
of
sweet
slightly
roasted
malts
yeast
and
banana
the
taste
is
kinda
sweet
malts
slight
tones
of
banana
medium
body
highly
carbonated
feel
in
the
tongue
drinkable
not
a
bad
brew
but
others
of
this
style
are
quite
different
and
more
refreshing
overall
this
beer
was
unimpressive
the
smell
and
taste
were
weak
and
lacked
complexity
for
the
style
worth
a
try
perhaps
slainte
had
this
on
tap
at
the
esplanade
biermarket
in
toronto
pours
an
impressive
dark
brown
with
a
bubbly
offwhite
head
that
laces
well
aroma
of
raisins
cloves
some
malt
and
a
hint
of
cranberry
i
would
have
liked
some
banana
in
there
taste
was
a
sweet
chocolately
front
with
bananas
and
chocolate
malt
pouring
in
and
a
raisiny
malt
finish
a
feeling
i
just
a
ate
a
banana
hop
character
was
low
as
the
style
would
dictate
mouthfeel
was
effervescent
yet
very
smooth
and
creamy
this
is
a
great
dunkel
weizen
this
was
my
first
dunkel
weizen
and
i
was
expecting
somethin
a
bit
different
perhaps
more
fruit
notes
the
flavours
and
smells
do
become
more
apparent
as
the
beer
warms
slightly
even
though
the
beer
was
not
excessively
chilled
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
a
nice
simple
creamy
sweet
flavour
and
texture
that
sits
comfortably
in
the
stomach
something
nice
when
you
are
not
looking
for
anything
too
complex
in
the
weissbier
category
a
good
sessioner
i
love
the
weissbier
dunkel
style
and
erdinger
is
an
excellent
example
but
i
believe
i
am
still
searching
for
the
style
defining
beer
eh
just
a
completely
average
dunkel
weizen
easy
enough
to
drink
but
not
much
else
to
make
it
interesting
d
id
say
this
is
my
favorite
hefeweizen
dunkel
so
far
nice
and
clean
flavors
in
this
are
a
little
stronger
than
a
standard
hefeweizen
lowering
the
drinkability
a
little
still
a
good
beer
its
worth
the
try
think
that
sums
it
up
i
reckon
this
would
make
a
great
breakfast
beer
if
such
things
were
allowed
in
my
house
the
taste
is
no
exception
bliss
nice
sweet
malt
flavor
up
front
along
with
some
banana
esters
fades
nicely
into
a
gently
toasted
malt
bitterness
with
a
touch
of
clove
and
lemon
a
nice
crisp
carbonation
brings
everything
together
on
the
palate
has
everything
you
could
ask
for
the
fullflavor
of
a
dark
beer
as
well
as
the
quenchability
of
a
light
beer
md
the
carbonation
is
on
the
verge
of
being
too
spritzy
not
as
soft
as
the
appearance
suggests
mediumbodied
no
sign
of
alc
easydrinking
but
the
texture
is
thinner
than
ideal
like
two
other
dunkel
weizen
ive
tasted
i
guess
this
style
is
simply
not
my
cup
of
tea
as
compared
with
hefeweizen
i
mean
still
a
solid
brew
by
all
standards
though
d
ok
this
would
probably
be
better
right
out
of
the
bottle
so
that
you
didnt
have
to
smell
it
mouthfeel
is
pleasant
effervescent
and
creamy
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
pleasant
not
too
heavy
quite
drinkable
nice
hefe
to
savor
though
not
as
wheaty
as
some
which
works
in
its
favor
and
actually
makes
it
quite
the
quaffable
brew
all
and
all
this
is
a
quite
elegant
dunkel
weizen
this
to
me
has
too
much
of
a
predominantly
flowery
and
perfumed
flavor
to
drink
too
many
but
i
am
sure
reasonable
minds
could
disagree
i
cant
recommend
this
get
weihenstephaner
instead
drinks
okay
just
not
very
memorable
try
it
decide
yourself
a
tame
malty
dunkel
not
the
best
example
of
the
style
as
it
lacks
complexity
and
just
about
any
weizen
characteristics
not
bad
as
a
beer
though
not
too
shabby
refreshing
and
good
looking
poured
dark
and
alluring
head
didnt
last
long
but
i
wasnt
paying
attention
as
i
was
captivated
by
the
deep
darkness
of
color
earthy
scents
predominated
with
some
sweetness
after
a
bit
of
persistence
the
taste
was
nice
and
mildly
sweet
with
earthy
nutty
aftertastes
in
fact
i
should
note
that
the
lingering
and
shifting
aftertaste
is
one
of
the
key
aspects
of
this
beer
the
carbonation
kicked
for
a
bit
but
it
was
really
not
a
problem
ill
keep
on
coming
back
to
this
one
ive
been
converted
to
the
ways
of
the
dunkel
on
wine
virtue
poetry
whatever
taste
mmmm
i
love
the
dark
wheat
its
almost
sweet
and
malty
but
it
has
that
wheat
sharpness
that
makes
it
almost
refreshing
this
beer
is
like
the
swissarmyknife
of
beers
i
could
drink
it
on
a
hot
day
or
on
a
winter
night
it
is
well
balanced
and
tasty

and
by

of
the
glass
a
few
floaties
had
settled
to

the

has
some
dark

to
it
like
raisins

the

into

then
into
me
good
all
around
overall
just

really

down

too
much

not

character
to
be
an

there
is

with

and
some
mild
spice
that
sits
on
the

pleasantly
there
is
a
solid
creaminess
going
on
but
even
that
falls
flat
with
a
bit
of
seltzery

in
the

with
a
touch
of

and
a

and
a

as
well
the
flavor
begins
with
a
rush
of
carbonation
tickling
the
tongue
revealing
a
dry
very
wheaty
malt
flavor
with
roasted
accents
but
no
bitterness
associated
with
roasted
malts
the
flavor
is
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
while
still
giving
the
drinker
a
complex
malt
flavor
the
carbontation
is
very
high
which
is
typical
for
the
style
though
i
find
that
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
when
the
beer
has
gotten
a
little
flatter
that
the
flavor
becomes
more
balanced
and
enjoyable
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
and
would
be
great
on
either
a
cold
night

a
hot

is

a

was

pretty

overall
this
is
a

too
bad
i
have
glanced
over
it
before
pours
a

with
a

and
tat
of

some

the

wheat
with
a
hint

the

is
about
the

with
a
good

that
goes
down
very
easy
with
a
sweet
finish
no
bitter
aftertaste
a
super
good
brew
o
to
be
honest
i
would
love
to
give
this
beer
closer
to
a
4
than
a
3
5
it
really
is
a
smooth
and
enjoyable
beer
but
it
lacks
the
intricacy
and
higher
complexity
a
4
beer
deserves
an
enjoyable
and
present
beer

by
no
means
a
powerhouse

o
this

has
some

and
is
very
easy

it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
a
decent

the
sweetness
definitely
the
star
here
as
outlined
above
good
overall
but
the
barest
of
upticks
in
abv
surely
isnt
enough
to
justify
the
hit
to
my
tastebuds
nice
but
unfortunately
readily
forgettable
prost
othis
is
the
perfect
example
of
the
style
the
germans
can
really
get
a
lot
of
mileage
out
of
only
four
ingredients
others
would
have
to
add
a
couple
of
ingredients
to
get
this
much
of
a
varied
flavor
profile
o
really
good
dunkelweizen
went
down
easy
and
smooth
o

expecting
more

the
brown
translucent
body
proves
its
a
dark
beer
the
head
forms
with
large
bubbles
and
settles
into
a
thin
layer
the
aroma
is
true
to
style
with
wheat
malts
and
citrus
notes
coming
through
i
must
have
not
been
in
the
mood
for
a
dark
wheat
as
the
malt
flavor
seemed
too
much
and
there
was
a
bit
of
metallic
ness
to
the
flavor
a
regular
hefe
would
have
been
preferred
i
have
had
dark
hefes
on
tap
in
munich
and
they
were
to
die
for
but
the
hacker
pschorr
from
the
bottle
did
not
do
the
trick
taste
shows
more
wheat
than
the
nose
and
is
crisp
and
light
despite
the
color
the
choco
notes
come
out
much
more
and
the
yeast
is
more
nutty
than
clove
and
banana
kinda
nice
for
a
switch
up
i
like
it
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
sooo
easy
to
drink
good
stuff
overall
and
excellent
german
brew
this
one
i
could
session
this
easily

all
the

dunkel
weisse

did
ok
with
this
one
overall
for
a
mass
produced
german
beer
this
one
is
pretty
close
to
style
prost
o
not
to
impressed
at
first
but
after
giving
it
a
look
over
it
really
is
delicious
and
very
drinkable
somewhat
watery
tasting
when
warm
it
tastes
much
better
cold
very
sessionable
would
not
necessarily
buy
again
unless
i
was
drinking
with
someone
who
only
likes
wheats
o
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
dunkelweizen
a
relaxing
beer
that
goes
down
way
too
easy
well
worth
a
try
pours

streaks
of

around

down
smell
is
of
wheat

some

taste
is
of

flavors
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
but
i
do
think
this
one
is
past
its
prime
at
this
point
overall
a
definite
winner
and
excellent
for
the
style
yummy
stuff
overall
a
great
example
of
a
style
that
i
really
enjoy
overall
as
with
the
other
hackerpschorr
beers
ive
had
over
the
years
its
firmly
just
ok
i
know
this
was
an
old
beer
and
im
somewhat
disappointed
that
i
bought
it
but
did
so
because
its
rarely
seen
in
these
parts
will
revisit
again
when
i
can
find
a
fresh
bottle
o
i
just
finished
a
vigorous
15mile
hike
and
sat
down
to
enjoy
this
beer
it
tasted
great
and
sure
is
a
nice
start
to
replacing
the
electrolytes
i
crave
see
the
movie
idiocracy
if
you
dont
get
this
joke
overall
an
interesting
beer
for
sure
but
really
it
is
98
hefe
and
2
dunkle
find
yourself
a
good
hefe
and
go
with
that
d
this
is
a
very
good
dunkelweizen
and
a
perfect
great
example
of
the
style
i
could
drink
these
all
night
poured
a
brilliant
orangeamber
color
with
a
smallish
beige
colored
head
a
little
spicy
on
the
nose
with
a
bit
of
caramel
some
cereal
and
rye
bread
on
the
palate
this
one
is
sweet
crisp
gingerbread
mint
and
medium
bodied
with
some
caramel
toasted
malt
and
cereal
overall
drinkability
creamy
smooth
no
off
elements
has
interesting
point
like
the
effervescent
carbonation
i
like
drinkability
yowza
this
is
an
incredible
brew
i
think
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
dunkelweizens
i
have
ever
had
o
very
drinkable
without
being
overpowering
on
any
front
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
to
someone
that
doesnt
normally
like
darker
beers
medium
bodied
decent
carbonation
fairly
smooth

easy
on

d
this
is
an
great
tasting
beer
not
quite
as
good
as
weihenstephaners
version
but
very
close
a
great
example
of
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
getting
this
at
13
bucks
a
case
was
the
deal
of
the
year
for
me
o
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
taste
was
more
yeast
and
clove
than
i
was
hoping
for
dark
caramel
tea
leaves
and
bready
a
good
deal
of
complexities
but
not
really
up
my
alley
drank
it
first
from
koppas
in
milwaukee
gave
it
another
try
just
cant
get
into
what
it
brings
to
the
table
doesnt
falter
because
of
lack
of
taste
i
just
cant
get
too
much
into
dunkels
still
the
mouthfeel
is
dissappointing
though
not
bad
its
too
thin
nearly
watery
and
it
doesnt
have
enough
carbonation
to
make
up
for
it
its
certainly
below
average
in
terms
of
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
dunkelweizen
its
not
revelatory
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
it
delivers
solid
flavors
pour
brings
a
somewhatmuddy
light
caramel
brew
that
isnt
terribly
hazy
offwhite
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
and
not
too
much
retention
the
nose
brings
some
light
dark
malts
and
even
a
hint
of
chocolate
along
with
clove
and
a
bit
of
banana
the
taste
doesnt
offer
too
much
more
and
is
a
bit
plainits
almost
as
if
the
malt
was
to
be
the
focus
in
this
beer
rather
than
the
yeast
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
a
touch
of
carbonation
drinks
decently
enough
but
there
was
nothing
really
getting
me
to
finish
the
bottle
this
isnt
a
bad
dark
wheat
beer
the
flavors
are
well
balanced
and
plentiful
without
being
watery
overall
the
appearance
and
scent
over
promise
on
the
taste
but
its
not
really
a
grave
offense
for
this
style
personally
i
prefer
weizens
overall
which
have
a
more
pronounced
fruity
flavor
but
i
think
everyone
should
try
this
at
least
once
to
see
if
it
caters
more
to
their
personal
preferences
there
is
nothing
bad
about
it
all
like
with
current
paulaners
a
6
or
12
pack
may
contain
a
sour
stinker
if
you
drink
this
and
its
sour
or
metallic
tasting
then
its
gone
over
pour
it
out
and
move

ive
also
discovered
a
produced

on

corner

tell
me
thats
a
mistake
a
subtle
dunkelweizen
of
a
lot
of
flavors
but
little
boldness
come
forthright
a

sweet
good
look
my
pour
was
like
the
pictures
nose
is
of
citrus
and
crisp

palate
is
mild
sweet

and
apple
toasty
in

somewhere
some
apple

very
discrete
coriander
finish
out
of

this
beer
was
a
rootbeerbrown
color
with
a
finger
of
khaki
head
the
retention
was
poor
and
the
lacing
was
sparse
in
scattered
broken
bands
the
aroma
was
of
caramel
malt
chocolate
malt
light
toasted
malt
nuts
and
curiously
malt
extract
the
flavors
were
of
toasted
malt
the
tang
of
wheat
caramel
malt
and
hints
of
crappy
coffee
slightly
tart
and
a
bitterness
of
citrus
peel
and
sharp
hops
came
through
on

didnt
exactly
land

dismount
the
mouthfeel
was

carbonation
good
d
this
beer
is
an
amazing
dunkel
ill
be
buying
more
of
this
for
sure
its
no
vitus
but
its
up
there
just
as
much
a
little
less
intense
than
the
vitus
but
worth
every
penny
and
its
a
little
more
avalible
to
me
pours
a
slightly
hazed
dark
amber
color
with
a
two
finger
yellowed
white
head
that
clings
to
everything
popping
the
cap
sends
sweet
wheat
malts
aromas
wafting
towards
my
being
hints
of
various
fruits
lots
of
clove
and
some
banana
round
out
the
nose
quite
well
the
taste
of
this
pulls
me
in
a
couple
of
directions
im
first
hit
with
some
caramel
burnt
sugar
and
plums
that
is
followed
up
by
and
hint
of
lemon
clove
and
banana
first
i
think
bock
then
its
clear
the
hefe
is
in
the
house
leaves
a
lingering
spicy
wheat
taste
on
the
tongue
medium
body
creamy
smooth
mouthfeel
lots
of
carbonation
not
usually
something
i
would
pick
up
but
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
i
could
see
a
few
of
these
on
a
warm
day
in
my
future
hefeweizens
are
fantastically
suited
to
hot
and
sunny
days
because
they
are
such
easy
going
refreshing
beers
dunkelweizens
sort
of
carry
that
same
affability
over
into
the
cooler
darker
evening
setting
of
those
same
kind
of
days
by
adding
that
extra
bit
of
colour
and
malty
richness
of
course
theyre
also
good
at
every
other
time
of
day
too

well
i
take
a
nice
quaff
and
its
got
good

up

quickly
turns

bready

the

good
medicinal
clove
and
banana
interplay
on
the
mild
finish
excellent
mouthfeel
very
delicate
and
balanced
well
with
the

drink
these
all

an
excellent
dukelweizen
poured
an
attractive
copper
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
lasted
for
quite
some
time
aroma
is
of
banana
clove
dark
fruit
and
bread
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
as
the
aroma
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
none
of
the
flavors
are
overdone
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
making
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
quite
high
very
thirst
quenching
this
is
my
favorite
hs
weissbier
just
loaded
with
favor
refreshing
and
sessionable
d
one
taste
and
i
wanted
to
guzzle
the
whole
glass
down
this
is
what
you
want
in
a
brew
would
be
good
any
time
of
year
maybe
not
quite
as
good
as
weihenstephaners
version
but
very
close
another
wonderful
example
of
my
favorite
style
of
beer
overall
it
is
a
pleasant
beer
would
be
a
thirst
quencher
in
the
summer
pours
a
dark
oakish
color
with
a
yellowish
hue
head
was
light
and
khaki
in
color
and
bubbly
and
foamy
in
texture
it
was
about
34
in
thick
aroma
was
a
relatively
strong
smell
of
raisin
bread
taste
was
a
mix
of
sweet
wheat
cloves
and
a
kick
of
spiciness
to
go
down
great
body
decent
thickness
and
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
not
too
heavy
and
a
great
taste
so
i
could
definitely
have
at
least
3
in
a
row
if
i
wanted
overall
quenching
and
delicious
a
very
very
good
dunkelweizen
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
noticed
production
date
of
1107
neverless
enjoyable
brew
and
look
forward
to
sampling
other
offerings
from
brewer
this
is
one
of
the
best
dark
wheat
beers
in
the
world
the
taste
is
so
smooth
for
a
wheat
beer
a
lot
of
wheat
beers
will
leave
a
funny
flavor
if
your
not
used
to
drinking
them
but
this
one
is
so
smooth
color
is
exceptional
and
you
have
to
pour
this
beer
in
a
tall
glass
and
watch
the
beautiful
bubbles
its
magical
dgood
great
body
with
pleasant
smooth
taste
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
with
flavor
and
substance
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
while
i
poured
this
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
poured
a
big
giant
head
the
smell
was
sour
and
sweet
the
beer
cloudy
the
beer
tasted
rotten
sour
if
you
like
sour
rotten
beer
the
by
all
means
drink
this
beer
should
not
be
sour
i
dont
care
which
country
likes
it
makes
it
or
loves
it
it
is
just
wrong
drinkability
extraordinary
drinkablity
i
could
drink
this
all
nite
long
very
thirst
quenching
and
well
balanced
really
nice
finish
and
flavor
very
great
example
of
the
style
smells
of
sweet
banana
and
wheat
bit
of
clove
spice
becoming
more
evident
with
warming
more
wheat
on
the
palate
somewhat
dry
and
with
a
light
toasted
grain
feel
on
the
finish
and
just
a
hint
of
fig
smooth
close
yet
a
bit
thin
at
times
not
offering
the
body
of
the
more
refined
weihenstephaner
in
my
view
even
though
it
may
be
truer
to
style
solid
nonetheless
though
not
as
complex
as
their
standard
weisse
with
regards
to
yeast
nuances
i
still
prefer
their
hefe
but
the
hacker
dunkel
is
certainly
a
first
rate
example
of
the
style
glad
i
could
try
it
on
draught
could
drink
this
all
night
one
of
the
best
dunkles
great
flavor
and
head
retention
love
the
malty
clover
tase
not
very
hoppy
true
to
style
wonderful
mouthfeel
and
smooth
malty
aftertaste
cloudy
as
a
summer
day
in
seattle
and
thats
a
good
thing
enjoy
this
one
in
the
summer
some
like
it
with
fruit
but
i
think
its
much
better
straight
up
this
beer
has
a
medium
body
and
is
pretty
carbonated
it
has
some
nice
drinkability
and
is
pretty
easy
on
the
palate
overall
this
is
a
great
dunkleweizen
pour
every
drop
of
sediment
out
of
the
bottle
to
maximize
your
dunkledrinking
pleasure
drinkability
easy
to
drink
on
the
whole
a
good
standard
for
this
beer
style
from
a
12oz
bottle
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
amber
colour
with
a
huge
frothy
off
white
head
smells
of
lighty
toasted
malts
light
fruit
and
bread
tastes
sweet
and
smooth
pretty
well
balanced
im
usually
not
a
fan
of
this
style
of
beer
but
this
one
is
quite
good
and
i
could
see
my
self
picking
it
up
again
pretty
drinkable
beer
overall
rather
good
overall
really
good
drinkability
a
little
high
on
the
carbonation
which
takes
away
from
the
taste
pretty
sweet
but
has
a
nice
roasted
character
and
tang
from
the
yeast
and
wheat
to
help
even
things
out
a
bit
d
very
flavorful
smooth
and
balanced
interesting
drink
that
easy
to
drink
this
is
one
of
the
best
dunklewizens
i
have
ever
had
great
beer
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
cloudy
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
aroma
is
mild
a
hint
of
cloves
taste
is
of
malt
and
wheat
with
some
fruitiness
very
flavorfull
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
highly
drinkable
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
pours
a
cloudy
coppermaize
color
54
inch
head
of
a
pale
tan
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
pear
coriander
yeast
sweet
malt
and
tart
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
dunkelweizen
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
acidic
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
yeast
pear
and
tart
malt
overall
a
good
aroma
good
appearance
lacking
in
complexity
and
weak
in
body
d
easy
to
drink
just
had
but
reviewing
from
memory
it
is
very
drinkable
i
wish
there
was
some
more
fruity
zest
however
it
was
very
good
nonetheless
d
drinking
this
i
could
of
swore
this
was
in
the
78
abv
range
with
all
the
malts
used
but
i
was
surprised
when
i
read
5
3
sessionable
but
my
tall
hacker
glass
was
enough
for
me
the
taste
is
just
very
onedemensional
leaving
me
not
wanting
to
order
another
this
is
pretty
drinkable
though
m
d
a
moderate
yet
assertive
carbonation
over
a
body
that
holds
its
own
with
a
little
weightiness
an
easy
going
drink
and
a
good
pairing
with
a
sauerbrauten
sandwich
nice
looking
brew
poured
to
a
cloudy
brown
color
almost
a
icedtea
color
with
a
huge
thick
fluffy
off
white
to
very
light
tan
head
that
has
good
retention
some
nice
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
though
not
as
much
as
i
had
expected
based
on
the
size
of
the
head
the
aroma
has
a
nice
wheat
smell
slightly
toasted
fruit
flavors
highlighted
by
banana
the
flavor
is
good
wheat
malt
flavors
come
to
mind
right
away
nice
roast
like
taste
the
middle
and
tail
end
see
the
flavors
changing
as
fruit
flavors
come
out
more
and
more
banana
is
the
major
fruit
flavor
but
i
feel
that
i
am
also
picking
up
some
pear
has
a
very
smooth
feel
ind
of
silky
as
it
goes
down
real
nice
brew
and
for
the
price
you
cant
beat
it
this
brew
drinks
very
easily
as
i
am
pretty
much
finished
with
it
already
could
be
a
good
session
brew
pretty
damn
good
wheat
beer
very
similar
in
character
to
boulevards
lunar
ale
which
i
tasted
recently
but
the
flavors
are
better
blended
and
the
body
is
noticeably
more
substantial
solid
all
around
and
worth
trying
for
sure
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
hackerpschorr
hefe
but
ive
found
that
with
weizens
freshness
is
key
and
bottles
sitting
on
unrefrigerated
shelves
dont
cut
it
my
feeling
is
that
for
an
kegged
import
this
is
still
in
relatively
good
shape
and
has
benefited
substantially
pours
a
dark
brown
colored
body
somewhat
cloudy
with
a
big
foamy
white
head
has
a
somewhat
flowery
aroma
lots
of
wheat
dark
roasted
aroma
enticing
smell
very
bubbly
dark
wheat
flavor
some
flowers
very
good
flavor
i
wonder
how
this
would
pair
with
an
apple
pie
or
if
you
could
cook
an
apple
pie
with
this
beer
i
think
this
beer
knocks
off
one
of
the
servings
of
fruit
i
should
eat
every
day
pours
a
hazy
kinda
muddy
looking
brown
with
a
small
tan
head
smells
of
sweet
toasted
wheat
fresh
tobacco
and
lots
of
yeast
tastes
like
liquified
wheaties
in
a
good
way
this
bottle
isnt
as
cold
as
it
should
be
and
so
ill
have
to
update
this
review
later
on
this
week
but
its
obvious
that
this
beer
is
a
solid
choice
mouthfeeldrinkability
gentle
carbonation
throughout
this
tasting
playing
off
of
the
flavors
with
a
light
to
medium
texture
a
very
enjoyable
drinkable
beer
and
right
for
the
occasion
whatever
that
may
be
tastes
sweet
like
the
black
spots
on
bananas
with
nutmeg
clove
and
a
yeasty
snap
with
swallow
spicy
on
the
tongue
albiet
a
little
thin
im
down
with
anything
that
tastes
like
bananas
drinability
fantastic
dukel
and
extra
tasty
very
enjoyable
nice
blend
of
mellow
wheat
and
caramel
malt
with
mild
banana
and
spices
rather
good
brew
nice
copperamber
pour
clouded
with
the
swirled
yeast
from
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
big
thick
head
and
moderate
lacing
mouthfeel
is
a
touch
thin
and
watery
which
sure
detracts
from
the
nice
aroma
and
very
good
flavor
d
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
the
dark
wheat
had
me
curious
i
hadnt
seen
many
around
and
i
was
looking
for
more
hacker
offerings
because
the
store
had
just
finished
off
their
hackerpschorr
marzen
octoberfest
growler
filling
keg
pours
a
clean
brown
color
with
a
decent
off
white
head
that
stay
around
a
while
smelled
of
sweet
malts
and
some
citrus
tasted
of
a
brown
ale
with
a
good
malty
caramel
flavor
but
with
citrus
flavors
coming
through
as
well
i
picked
up
some
orange
it
was
a
very
nice
blend
and
went
together
perfectly
the
best
part
was
the
nice
creamy
rich
mouthfeel
it
had
it
went
down
easy
d
oveall
a
well
rounded
dark
wheat
that
was
balanced
quite
nicely
and
drank
clean
really
nice
experience
d
very
nice
beer
that
id
love
to
visit
again
good
for
a
summer
session
d
this
is
a
great
tasting
dunkel
ive
only
seen
it
one
place
and
i
only
grabbed
one
a
decision
that
i
regret
d
a
solid
dunkelweizen
though
ive
had
many
better
no
problems
finishing
the
bottle
but
for
this
style
ill
go
elsewhere
next
time
methinks
in
summary
try
this
one
you
wont
be
disappointed
i
dont
like
weisse
beers
having
said
that
this
beer
is
extraordinary
appearance
is
cloudy
mocha
brown
wih
a
tight
beige
head
tons
of
lace
aroma
has
loads
of
banana
and
clove
esters
that
dance
ever
so
delicately
with
that
familiar
german
melanoidin
and
bready
malts
along
with
floral
noble
hops
very
complex
flavor
is
where
its
at
though
with
a
complex
palatefull
of
banana
esters
spices
like
nutmeg
and
cinnamon
bready
maltiness
and
molasses
cookies
or
maybe
ginger
snaps
flowery
noble
hops
are
moderate
here
but
bitterness
is
just
enough
to
balance
everything
together
mediumfull
mouthfeel
with
all
that
suspended
yeast
and
a
bit
sweet
in
the
finish
this
is
a
treat
to
drink
on
tap
if
you
find
it
i
like
this
beer
not
as
much
as
the
hackerpschorr
hefeweizen
though
still
its
a
totally
drinkable
session
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
dunkel
i
think
it
would
go
very
well
with
a
grilled
pork
chop
with
apple
slices
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
thick
foamy
head
on
a
light
caramel
colored
body
smelled
of
a
typical
weisse
with
a
nice
measure
of
sweetness
throw
banana
and
caramel
in
there
as
well
taste
was
along
the
same
lines
with
the
caramel
and
sweetness
a
touch
stronger
than
the
smell
led
on
interesting
that
i
detected
little
or
no
citrus
exceptionally
smooth
very
very
easy
to
drink
excellent

i
should
have
known
from
the
label
description
that
this
could
turn
out
to
be
a
bit
of
a
hot
but
not
in
that
way
mess
really
a
dunkel
from
bamberg
tutoring
no
less
welded
onto
a
traditional
english
ale
so
here
in
canada
trad
from
big
rock
then
fails
abound
no
lie
the
german
association
is
not
even
particularly
wheaty
let
alone
a
smokefilled
miasma
as
i
might
have
been
coerced
into
being
led
into
believing
not
a
bad
brew
overall
just
nothing
like
what
the
marketing
arm
sai
oh
right
pours
a
crystal
clear
dark
brown
with
ruby
at
the
edges
and
a
wispy
off
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
butter
caramel
and
toffee
dominate
the
aroma
with
traces
of
dish
soap
i
find
no
weizen
or
hops
in
the
aroma
of
this
brew
the
flavor
isnt
much
better
than
the
aroma
buttery
burnt
caramel
with
a
soapy
edge
medium
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
im
not
sure
what
they
were
shooting
for
here
but
its
safe
to
say
they
missed
i
must
admit
ive
never
had
a
dunkel
not
available
near
me
i
have
had
many
english
ales
and
brew
mostly
english
style
ales
to
me
this
is
just
too
damn
sour
contrary
to
picaroons
intentions
dark
and
stormy
night
does
not
provide
all
the
rich
flavours
of
a
stout
or
porter
with
the
easy
drinkability
of
a
wheat
beer
it
lacks
the
quantity
of
the
former
and
the
quality
of
the
latter
it
has
only
a
mild
trifling
amount
of
roast
and
nowhere
near
the
spice
fruit
or
effervescence
of
a
dunkelweizen
nice
beer
but
not
whats
advertised
the
taste
is
drier
than
the
smell
indicates
although
the
swallow
brings
out
some
of
the
sweetness
again
there
is
little
wheat
flavor
the
body
is
somewhat
chewy
but
the
carbonation
is
appropriately
high
there
is
a
good
dose
of
toasted
malt
crystal
that
provides
a
biscuity
flavor
this
is
smooth
and
easily
drinkable
but
dont
expect
a
typical
dunkelweizen
i
like
sour
ales
so
i
didnt
mind
drinking
this
but
i
really
dont
think
the
end
result
matched
either
my
expectations
or
my
desires
still
i
appreciate
picaroons
for
trying
something
new
experimentation
is
always
welcome
in
the
craft
beer
world
and
i
welcome
it
od
cool
different
nice
and
a
good
mix
of
flavours
overall
this
one
is
a
delicious
malt
bomb
and
one
of
the
better
beers
i
had
on
my
trip
to
canada
i
love
the
chocolate
and
caramel
comboyet
this
one
is
not
cloying
somehow
could
drink
this
all
night
it
falls
in
line
with
other
sweeter
beers
like
those
from
southern
tier
i
graded
this
though
to
the
style
of
dunkleweizen
though
and
this
i
believe
does
behave
like
a
dunkleweizen
at
all
there
is
no
murkiness
or
wheat
balancemaybe
this
is
just
a
strange
hybrid
brew
call
this
a
porter
and
i
give
it
4s
overall
well
you
win
some
and
lose
some
i
guess
thats
the
fun
of
trying
new
things
the
brewery
called
this
a
cross
between
dunkelweiss
and
an
engligh
brown
ale
but
its
basically
just
an
identity
crisis
in
a
bottle
its
dark
with
lots
of
wheat
a
bit
of
bitterness
from
the
hops
and
then
some
tartness
from
the
land
of
ooops
combine
that
with
an
annoyingly
noisy
head
and
an
overcarbonated
body
and
youve
got
a
recipe
that
will
make
drain
a
happy
camper
not
my
thing
thanks
again
for
the
trade
cjbmcdon
poured
a
deep
deep
goldenamber
big
egg
shell
colored
was
fluffy
but
leveled
out
rather
quickly
big
malty
nose
sweet
like
candy
is
strong
hard
for
other
scents
to
find
their
way
through
the
taste
is
a
little
funky
bland
to
start
and
then
the
roasted
malts
coffee
beans
hit
an
overload
of
carbonation
is
also
noted
other
than
excess
carb
there
is
a
creaminess
to
the
beer
somewhat
acidic
a
pretty
good
beer
here
and
the
low
alcohol
and
decent
pricing
make
a
good
buy
nice
to
mix
it
up
every
once
in
a
while
d
i
dont
think
this
beer
knows
what
it
wants
to
be
listed
here
as
a
dunkel
but
the
brewery
lists
it
as
a
hybrid
of
a
dunkel
and
english
brown
i
commend
trying
new
things
but
this
combo
doesnt
particularly
work
it
is
somewhat
drinkable
and
the
finish
is
decent
just
not
a
beer
id
make
an
effort
for
in
short
the
bottle
i
had
contained
something
out
of
style
and
with
some
problems
if
picaroons
can
figure
out
the
diacetyl
issue
this
could
get
better
right
now
however
it
is
a
mess
very
drinkable
i
thought
d
not
hard
to
drink
but
the
dark
fruits
and
hops
seem
to
be
unbalanced
also
this
is
not
a
great
representation
of
a
dunkel
in
a
word
i
would
say
avoid
bottle
poured
a
dark
black
color
beer
with
a
large
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
sweet
malt
with
great
notes
of
candi
sugar
with
some
medicinal
notes
taste
is
surprisingly
bland
with
some
very
light
sweet
notes
and
a
light
cough
syrup
finish
body
is
kind
of
thin
with
good
carbonation
this
was
a
very
weird
experience
and
doesnt
really
resemble
a
dunkleweizen
ok
brew
easy
to
drink
but
could
use
some
more
distinction
in
flavor
and
aroma
i
wouldnt
suggest
this
to
anyone
that
is
interested
german
style
brews
dunkels
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
one
misses
the
mark
by
a
mile
note
i
was
going
to
add
this
one
tonight
though
it
seems
as
though
someone
beat
me
to
the
punch
i
was
going
to
add
it
as
an
english
brown
ale
as
it
tastes
more
like
that
than
a
dunkelweizen
not
much
yeastiness
and
breadiness
present
the
label
calls
it
a
mix
between
a
german
dunkel
and
an
english
ale
brown
ale
is
the
closest
i
could
come
up
with
500
ml
bottle
deep
chestnut
brown
pour
is
topped
with
a
frothy
mocha
cap
leaving
nice
lace
the
aromas
are
grainy
and
sour
and
filled
with
diacetyl
there
is
a
dark
fruit
component
trying
to
come
through
but
it
only
makes
a
brief
appearance
as
the
off
aromas
constantly
take
over
tastes
sweet
upfront
of
figs
and
grains
some
bready
yeast
as
well
then
comes
the
unfortunate
sour
and
buttery
disaster
it
completely
takes
over
everything
else
the
finish
is
grainy
and
sour
with
a
boatload
of
buttered
popcorn
in
the
aftertaste
ive
never
had
a
butterbomb
dunkelweizen
before
i
really
wanted
to
like
this
beer
but
unfortunately
i
just
couldnt
still
a
great
beer
just
not
as
great
as
i
remember
it
that
was
10
years
ago
though
great
choice
here
and
another
very
solid
offering
you
can
smell
the
yeast
adn
there
is
not
much
mouthfeel
o
decent
dunkelweizen
but
not
strong
in
flavor
easy
going
down
while
some
weizen
connoisseurs
might
find
the
unusual
taste
and
mouthfeel
offputting
i
think
it
would
be
wellreceived
by
fans
of
rich
beers
overall
it
was
excellent
refreshing
and
very
very
tasty
i
will
surely
try
this
one
again
all
in
all
this
delicious
beer
was
a
more
than
pleasant
surprise
and
i
have
to
call
it
one
of
the
best
weissbiers
i
have
ever
had
a
nonboring
without
being
extreme
in
any
regard
offering
in
a
species
that
can
something
become
a
bit
regular
their
regular
hefe
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
so
it
is
a
nice
surprise
that
this
is
a
full
bodied
dunkel
with
a
strong
malty
finish
the
nose
is
bready
rather
than
bubblegum
or
bananas
the
beer
needs
to
warm
up
to
show
its
nuances
but
the
beer
is
quite
balanced
with
the
typical
hefe
showings
arising
late
in
the
finish
one
of
the
better
dunkels
available
the
dunkelness
of
this
beer
hit
me
in
the
finish

clean
dry
and
smooth
a
pleasurable
easydrinker
ill
definitely
revisit
taste
carries
all
the
spice
over
from
the
nose
with
lots
of
punchy
malt
flavour
low
bitterness
but
some
classic
lemony
sourness
and
a
bit
of
acidity
in
the
finish
tied
all
neatly
together
with
the
banana
apple
and
pear
flavours
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
heavy
with
a
medium
near
perfect
carbonation
a
very
tasty
summer
evening
session
brew
and
hands
down
beats
the
edelweiss
hefeweizen
this
doesnt
draw
you
in
and
urge
you
on
to
drink
more
instead
it
has
a
quiet
confidence
and
subtlety
as
if
to
say
go
ahead
take
your
time
ill
be
hear
when
youre
ready
for
another
sip
the
nice
gentle
mouthfeel
is
relaxing
and
reminiscent
of
wraping
yourself
in
a
nice
fuzzy
warm
blanket
definitely
well
worth
having
again
unfortunately
i
brought
this
one
back
from
calgary
and
neither
this
nor
any
of
its
style
are
available
in
my
neck

this

muted
edelweisss
dunkel
redcap
bottle
poured
with
typical
germanwheat
beauty
bubbling
over
the
rim
enormously
but
somehow
never
spilling
due
to
the
genius
of
the
designed
glass
the

was
mammoth

had
the
consistency
of

creamexceptional
no
glass
is
more
fitting
for
its
style
in
my
experience
than
a
german
wheat
beer
or
hefe
glass
this
dunkel
is
not
as
dark
as
say
erdingers
but
more
a
dirty
brown
darker
near
the
top
than
the
bottom
caramel
and
butterscotch
colouration
and
dense
with
yeast
hazy
a
cream
coloured
head
with
some
darker
spots
where
the
remaining
yeast
dripped
in
from
the
bottle
large
bubbles
of
lace
on
the
sides
leaving
some
web
patterns
it
smells
similar
to
many
pale
hefes
and
the
dark
malts
really
do
not
make
much
of
a
difference
instead
the
lovely
fruity
aromas
of
banana
strawberry
spices
some
lactose
and
in
the
background
some
lightly
roasted
malt
the
dunkel
has
more
spice
than
their
hefetrub
the
malt
is
a
little
more
felt
in
the
mouth
leaving
a
nice
grainy
taste
the
intensely
fruity
aroma
is
also
more
subdued
in
the
taste
indeed
the
taste
really
balances
all
the
notes
from
the
smell
estery
cloves
and
banana
can
be
tasted
at
first
in
the
middle
i
can
taste
the
hardness
of
the
water
and
the
finish
is
the
best
part
not
very
lingering
but
leaving
my
mouth
with
a
desire
for
another
sip
the
alcohol
is
detectable
in
the
middle
and
the
hops
barely
i
found
the
mouthfeel
a
little
light
even
for
a
wheat
beer
the
water
is
a
little
too
detectable
and
the
dunkel
style
had
me
expecting
some
more
body
from
the
malt
but
that
is
not
the
case
what
it
lacks
in
body
though
it
makes
up
for
in
drinkability
a
very
nice
summer
wheat
beer
from
austrias
renowned
weissbier
brewery
paired
nicely
with
jarlsberg
cheese
its
worthwhile
to
try
this
beer
out
if
you
are
a
fan
of
the
dunkel

style

cloudy
and
murky
body
on
the
pour
quite
opaque
in
the
middle
of
the
glass
varying
degrees
of
ochre
colour
massive
spongy
offwhite
head
at
first
which
takes
its
sweet
time
to
descend
and
leaves
a
fair
sized
cap
most
of
the
way
down
the
glass
there
is
a
sweetness
of
wheat
and
yeast
on
the
nose
along
with
banana
and
some
nutmeg
and
clove
the
profile
is
definitely
sweet
and
then
mildly
spicy
more
balance
in
the
flavour
with
the
sweetness
and
spice
crisp
wheat
at
first
sweetening
up
in
the
middle
with
some
banana
and
then
the
crispness
pops
up
again
on
the
finish
with
some
light
hops
to
accompany
the
nuttiness
of
the
spices
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
adds
to
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
the
aftertaste
leaves
me
with
the
impression
of
candied
bananas
yet
fortunately
the
crispness
of
texture
and
taste
helps
take
the
edge
off
of
that
a
bit
would
be
a
big
hit
for
those
with
a
sweet
tooth
very
drinkable
but
i
like
a
stronger
flavor
to
my
wheat
beers
orange
to
brown
body
not
too
hazy
under
a
frothy
head
this
was
an
older
bottle
so
some
of
the
haze
may
have
been
in
the
sedimentation
retains
a
hint
of
dark
roasted
flavor
but
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
from
the
wheat
german
hops
pretty
well
balanced
this
is
a
real
nice
beer
in
my
opinion
it
wont
make
me
a
wheat
beer
drinker
on
a
regular
basis
but
it
could
be
a
change
of
pace
beer
for
me

large
frothy
white
head

to

sized
bubbles

brown
body
it
has
a
medium
strength
malty
wheat
banana
aroma
and
a
banana
wheat
flavor
with
a
smooth
mildy
tingly
mouthfeel
an
ok
brew
at
best
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
beer
had
a
medium
tan
head
with
small
bubbles
that
fully
diminished
the
body
was
cloudy
and
was
the
hue
of
cider
the
lacing
was
fair
and
the
carbonation
was
somewhat
fizzy
there
were
numerous
aromas
such
as
banana
clove
spice
and
fruit
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
thin
and
watery
this
was
a
mild
tasting
beer
and
one
that
could
probably
get
me
in
trouble
on
any
given
night
as
it
was
very
smooth
which
is
very
much
to
my
liking
not
bad
slightly
chocolatey
and
fruity
banana
flavours
but
not
one
of
the
better
dark
wheats
youll
find
generally
easy
drinking
dark
german
wheat
smooth
and
lghtly
tart
and
refreshing
uncomplex
flavour
and
a
nice
one
for
session
drinking
look
to
andechser
paulaner
for
better
examples
of
the
style
this
isnt
bad
though
it
poured
a
nice
hazy
medium
dark
golden
brown
with
some
foam
and
not
much
lace
if
any
the
smell
was
of
cloves
with
a
hint
of
malts
and
hops
couldnt
pick
up
any
wheat
aromoa
at
all
the
taste
was
had
a
lot
of
cloves
and
a
hint
of
malts
and
hops
with
a
very
little
wheat
if
any
the
big
set
back
for
me
was
it
was
to
acidic
to
over
powering

enough
to
satisfy

truly
a

tasty
authentic
dunkel
wiessbier
from
germany
so
good
and
to
drink
it
in
the
teutonia
mannechor
pittsburghs
german
club
was
outstanding
absolutely
fantastic
not
as
lovely
as
their
helles
and
not
at
the
level
of
weihenstephaner
but
this
brew
is
plenty
enjoyable
head
is
unimpressive
darker
than
expected
even
for
a
dunkel
weisse
smells
of
roast
pencil
shavings
and
faint
notes
of
fruitiness
and

o
i
was
expecting
something
similar
to
schneider
weisse
original
and
weihenstephaner
dunkel
but
this
is
an
entirely
different
take
on
the
style
and
that
is
great
the
roasted
flavour
comes
more
into
place
here
giving
a
well
balanced
and
enjoyable
bier
fill
your
boots
o
delicious
yet
another
andechser
beer
i
feel
is
underrated
try
this
beer
if
you
like
dunkelweizens
we
need
to
import
more
of
these
bavarian
banana
bombs
over
here
this
one
has
aroma
of
fresh
baked
banana
bread
and
a
rich
ripe
fruit
and
caramel
taste
to
match
unfiltered
and
dark
with
more
ester
flavor
than
most
of
the
other
german
imports
typically
available
exceptionally
smooth
with
a
slight
tart
finish
my
first
andechs
beer
pours
into

a
large
blooming
tan

atop
roasted
bananas
in

along
with

bananas
are

on
the

with
a

of
nuttiness
and
chocolatethe
phenols
are
not
in
your
face
wow
a
great
dunkel
weiss
here
flavor
packed
but
subtle
the
taste
and
texture
are
both
outstanding
a
good
amount
of
flavor
for
a
dunkel
without
being
too
like
a
hefe
simply
with
toasted
qualities
t
plain
and
simple
like
a
slice
of
chocolate
chip
banana
bread
light
twang
of
bubblegum
toffee
brown
sugar
walnuts
cracked
wheat
and
hop
spice
this
beer
is
just
as
good
in
summer
with
its
light
body
as
it
is
in
the
winter
months
with
its
comforting
flavor
overall
so
much
flavor
for
a
5
beer
this
style
and
doppelbocks
are
becoming
a
favorite
of
mine
this
brewery
makes
both
both
if
which
are
awesome
stuff
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
overall
yes
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
simple
and
elegant
notes
first
dunkelweizen
i
ever
try
medium
body
with
soft
carbonation
and
a
strong
peppery
spice
presence
up
front
that
lingers
over
the
yeast
citrus
and
sweeter
malt
notes
into
a
spritzy
tart
finish
hints
of
black
pepper
and
clove
dominate
at
first
but
are
soon
countered
by
some
sourdough
bread
and
banana
before
some
citric
acidity
kicks
in
on
the
back
end
the
malt
presence
isnt
as
prominent
as
in
the
nose
but
its
still
evident
with
subtle
roast
and
hints
of
toasted
malt
hazelnut
caramel
and
toffee
decent
amount
of
sweetness
without
taking
away
from
the
classic
wheat
beer
flavors
slightly
tart
lemon
juicepith
flavor
toward
the
back
of
the
palate
crisp
and
refreshing
and
while
its
heavier
than
an
average
weissebier
its
still
pretty
easy
to
drink
spicy
malty
fruity
and
sweet
the
carbonation
was
just
a
bit
low
for
my
liking
but
it
didnt
detract
enough
from
the
delicate
balance
of
flavor
for
me
to
deduct
too
much
between
ayinger
weihen
and
now
andechs
it
seems
like
those
500ml
german
bottles
are
always
a
hit

along
with

o
this

a

to

echo
bar
in
downtown
munich
heavenly
beers
in

never
knew
that
andechs
was
available
in

wonderfully
delicious

refreshing
beer
even
for
a

weissbier
full
flavor
sweet
malts
ill
stock
up
if
i
can
find
more
i
recommend
you
do
the
same
pouring
a
very
dark
brown
with
reddish
brown
highlights
this
beer
is
capped
with
a
dense
light
brown
head
with
excellent
retention
and
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
all
sorts
of
dunkelweizen
delicious
ridiculousness
caramelized
bananas
spiced
with

straight
out
of
the

exceptionally
flavorful
and
balanced
minimal
roast
with
some
toffee
honey
and
toasted

the

is
like
an
alcoholic
candy
bar
and
i
mean
in
the
most
refined
and
addictive
kind
of
way
sweet
bananas
tempered
by
toasted
wheat
and
a
carbonic
acidity
a
delicate
but
fresh
and
clean
clove
phenolic
character
balanced
by
a
touch
of
chocolate
and
a
mellow
hop
character
with
earth
pairing
beautifully
with
the
spice
and
sweetness
this
beer
is
outrageously
good
medium
light
in
body
crisp
but
creamy
in
carbonation
this
beer
finishes
dry
with
a
blend
of
banana
clove
and
cocoa
the
wheat
huskiness
and
carbonic
acid
lend
a
cleansing
bite
to
the
finish
making
this
downright
quaffable
if
a
hair
watery
still
this
is
outstanding
very
highly
recommended
for
under
3
a
bottle
it
doesnt
get
better
than
this
very
nice
an
underappreciated
style
and
one
that
is
very
well
done
here
nice
complexity
and
balance
here
with
an
underlying
richness
that
you
appreciate
as
you
drink
bought
one
bottle
could
easily
drink
another
right
now
mild
darker
malt
taste
of
toast
and
raw
grains
the
swallow
has
a
hop
presence
but
the
stronger
flavor
is
of
the
wheat
brief
sour
aftertaste
thin
bodied
with
a
sizable
carbonation
level
a
classic
taste
from
an
old
brewery
top
dark
wheat
and
great
autumn
beer
o
a
very
fine
dunkel
right
up
there
with
the
best
i
finished
this
beer
in
no
time
flat
this
is
not
by
any
stretch
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
this
beer
is
probably
my
benchmark
now
for
the
style
it
is
flat
out
incredible
overall
a
tasty
weissbier
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
a
bit
uneven
nice
though
the
best
part
is
the
mix
between
barley
and
wheat
very
smooth
and
well
balanced
pleasant
dunkelweizen
however
i
lean
towards
the
brighter
weizen
of
this
brand
overall
nice
but
a
bit
thin
nice
malts
interesting
almost
steinbier
flavors
fairly
tasty
and
very
drinkable
body
is
medium
to
mediumlight
with
just
a
bit
of
wateriness
around
the
edges
carbonation
is
present
but
light
and
effervescent
allowing
the
beer
to
feel
fairly
crisp
and
yet
foam
up
a
bit
on
the
palate
as
it
travels
along
finish
is
dry
generally
very
drinkable
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
dunkel
weizen
o
well
worth
a
shot
this
is
not
a
typical
weissbier
in
a
blind
tasting
i
perhaps
would
rather
have
thought
of
a
rauchbier
although
not
as
rich
as
schlenkerla
interesting
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
buy

an
even
mahogany
translucently
opaque
with
a
solid

huge

aroma
dominates
the
smell
with
pumpernickel
bread
on
the
side
and
heaping
helpings
of
licorice
raisins
and
rum
without
the

taste
like
a
dry
drinkable
cinnamon
roll
sublimated
with
nuances
of
basil
anise
clove
root
beer
and
some
faint
banana
bread
the
carbonation
is
slightly
too
sharp
and
the
body
slightly
too
thin
to
carry
all
these
wonderful
flavors
but
nonetheless
this
is
delicious
i
wish
i
could
have
tried
all
the
andechser
beers
at
this
place
but
unfortunately
could
only
get
through
three
next
time
overall
neither
the
aroma
nor
the
flavors
blew
me
away
with
this
beer
although
both
were
very
solid
everything
else
was
solidly
above
average
making
this
beer
well
worth
a
shot
the
beer
pours
an
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
dark
fruit
yeast
and
caramel
the
flavor
is
similar
with
dark

caramel
toffee
yeast
bananas
and
cloves
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
good
dunkelweizen
from
a
very
good
brewery
notes
best
before

overall
a
nice
dunkelweizen
well
balanced
and
flavorful
all
though
it
was
a
bit
thin
it
didnt
blow
me
away
but
was
a
solid
beer
a
great
combination
of
yeast
esters
wheat
and
darker
malts
this
really
comes
across
as
a
typical
example
of
the
style
with
al
the
great
flavours
i
want
a
great
summer
quaffer
once
again
venison
with
a
port
wine
sauce
or
duck
as
the
spiciness
of
this
brew
would
clean
the
palate
nicely
with
a
rich
meat
well
done
i
think
for
a
dw
to
truly
be
great
it
should
stand
out
like
the
wiehenstephan
example
tasty
brew
quite
drinkable
overall
definitely
a
disappointment
there
was
just
nothing
much
to
this
and
what
was
there
wasnt
all
that
great
the
scent
beautiful
colour
and
the
little
bite
at
the
end
were
nice
but
this
one
just
didnt
have
the
complete
package
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
the
beer
has
a
thick
head
almost
like
guinness
from
the
tap
the
beer
is
very
dark
almost
black
i
could
smell
cloves
and
a
hint
of
malt
the
initial
taste
was
that
of
cloves
and
banana
bread
and
the
aftertaste
had
a
roasted
malt
character
to
it
as
i
drank
more
of
the
beer
i
noticed
more
of
a
chocolate
taste
a
nice
example
of
a
rather
unusual
style
a
good
wheat
beer
for
the
winter
nights
definitely
not
andechs
most
impressive
offering
but
it
confuses
me
to
see
average
ratings
for
this
brewerys
beer
as
far
as
i
can
tell
and
after
having
drunk
most
of
the
andechs
line
most
of
their
brews
are
clearly
above
average
not
what
i
was
expecting
a
big
disappointment
to
be
honest
quite
short
aftertaste
taste
was
great
without
the
vegetables
and
much
better
balanced
ripe
bananas
with
some
exotic
fruit
with
caramel
and
dark
chocolate
there
is
also
some
powdery
cocao
in
taste
and
mouthfeel
which
is
also
slightly
sweet
and
sticky
the
yeast
adds
a
nice
phenolic
taste
and
makes
the
mouthfeel
a
little
coarse
bb151106
cola
to
coffeeblack
beer
and
a
beige
head
above
nose
is
bananas
floating
around
in
a
sweet
wet
grass
field
quiet
some
maltyness
but
no
roast
detectable
and
bit
of
butter
there
not
a
bad
beer
but
the
whole
beer
is
comming
as
a
mess
to
me
quiet
unbalanced
as
is
taste
dry
and
caramellic
dont
fit
together
and
missing
a
burnt
feeling
in
a
dark
beer
as
this
is
though
having
quiet
some
bitterness
for
a
wheatbeer
as
this
is
litle
more
wheat
detectable
in
taste
as
in
nose
but
wouldnt
give
this
a
weizenbeer
when
tasted
blindly
except
maybe
for
the
mega
bananatree
thats
right
there
still
well
drinkable
and
certainly
something
else
as
the
regular
d
ist
gut
bham
uk
sampled
on
101005
at
probka
the
beer
came
out
a
cloudy
caramel
brown
under
3
5
fingers
of
thick
beige
head
that
lingered
throughout
the
session
and
left
some
very
nice
lacing
the
nose
is
marked
by
yeast
and
lemon
but
is
fairly
mild
the
mouth
is
light
and
very
prickly
the
taste
is
mild
and
characterized
by
yeast
slightly
heavier
than
a
pale
with
subtle
coriander
and
fruit
a
bit
of
caramel
emerges
as
it
warms
but
hops
are
nowhere
to
be
found
mild
smooth
and
nice
brew
i
dont
really
know
what
i
think
about
this
beer
i
guess
i
just
expected
more
from
andechs
on
this
one
a
very
dark
opaque
body
almost
black
with
a
lasting
thick
bubbly
head
on
top
not
exuberantly
foamy
though
the
smell
was
kinda
weak
showing
some
light
bready
notes
and
hints
of
the
traditional
weizen
styles
with
a
lot
more
emphasis
on
caramel
the
taste
too
was
very
caramely
for
a
dunkel
weizen
toasted
and
lamost
burnt
the
classic
bready
weizen
thing
was
almost
hidden
mouthfeel
was
round
but
the
brew
overall
lacked
of
balanced
not
fitting
right
into
its
style
not
bad
but
just
nothing
in
comparison
with
their
doppelbock
500
