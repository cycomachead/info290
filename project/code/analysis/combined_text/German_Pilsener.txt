overall
im
trying
to
think
when
i
last
had
beer
from
a
can
and
i
honestly
cant
remember
what
i
do
know
is
that
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
this
cans
seem
to
be
making
a
comeback
and
if
this
is
typical
of
a
canned
craft
beer
then
bring
it
on
calling
this
a
proper
pils
is
probably
wide
of
the
mark
but
as
an
american
interpretation
of
same
it
more
than
stands
on
its
own
merits
well
worth
tracking
down
itd
make
a
superb
summer
drink
my
beer
guru
picked
up
a
variety
pack
of
skyfox
and
this
is
one
off
the
ones
he
left
for
me
no
recommendation
one
way
or
the
other
so
not
sure
what
to
expect
decent
looking
beer
for
a
pils
surprising
taste
as
a
non
fan
of
pils
i
actually
enjoyed
this
one
i
have
a
couple
more
of
skyfox
and
i
now
have
a
little
expectations
good
beer
overall
its
a
fine
beer
not
the
best
flavor
profile
representative
of
the
style
but
is
still
a
good
summer
brew
and
enjoyable
a
hoppy
and
refreshing
pilsner
would
drink
this
again
o
a
really
fine
german
pils
with
a
nice
bready
crackery
malt
character
and
good
dose
of
bitterness
from
noble
hopping
nice
a
tasty
pilsner
with
good
depth
it
looks
superb
perhaps
enhanced
by
the
glass
while
the
aroma
and
flavour
have
subtle
hop
and
malt
notes
that
balance
perfectly
good
body
a
great
little
brew
crisp
and
refreshing
well
worth
grabbing
if
you
come
across
it
o
this
was
really
quite
tasty
im
not
sure
the
higher
hop
presence
is
appropriate
to
style
but
i
really
enjoyed
it
maybe
my
favorite
pilsner
ive
had
this
is
a
soft
mellow
take
o
the
pilsner
style
and
its
yet
another
example
of
an
american
craft
brew
that
if
it
ever
saw
mass
marketing
would
likely
be
widely
enjoyed
by
the
mass
public
philadelphia
brewings
kenziger
strikes
me
as
another
example
of
this
i
would
not
posit
this
as
my
goto
for
the
style
but
it
aint
bad
at
all
and
i
think
would
session
extremely
well
also
a
good
pick
to
introduce
a
conservative
friend
to
craft
beer
shouldnt
be
that
far
out
of
anyones
comfort
zone
mildly
recommendable
this
is
a
real
interesting
take
czech
added
hops
with
german
ingredients
to
boot
came
out
with
a
nice
contrast
and
very
enjoyable
decent
thickness
but
could
be
thicker
very
disappointing
pale
yellow
color
slightly
hazy
thin
bright
white
head
grassy
earthy
aroma
mild
flavor
slight
corngrain
taste
and
mild
earthy
hops
thin
body
medium
carbonation
easy
drinking
not
my
favorite
style
but
easy
drinking
summer
beer
not
a
bad
pilsener
at
all
it
has
a
great
light
and
refreshing
taste
that
goes
down
very
easily
and
would
make
a
great
session
beer
do
the
orange
pithy
aftertaste
would
make
me
keep
coming
back
if
this
were
available
to
me
all
the
time
highly
drinkable
as
is
it
will
stay
on
my
wants
list
in
hopes
for
another
try
in
the
future
well
received
by
this
dude
and
recommended
to
pils
fans
thanks
a
ton
to
pabeerdude
for
getting
me
a
couple
cans
of
this
long
time
want
o
i
enjoyed
this
brew
on
a
hot
almostsummer
day
and
would
be
glad
to
have
it
again
a
great
pils
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
i
normally
dont
session
pilsners
but
this
is
one
worth
sessioning
for
sure
on
draft
at
the
pony
bar
the
beer
appears
clear
and
pale
golden
with
a
thin
white
collar
the
aroma
brings
floral
hops
and
grain
the
taste
follows
suit
nicely
balanced
with
a
lovely
hop
finish
i
may
need
to
get
another
round
of
this
i
love
a
good
pilsner
a
good
pilsener
overall
it
is
light
and
crisp
refreshing
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
definite
session
beer
and
perfect
for
the
summer
i
liked
it
a
lot
and
thought
it
was
a
great
american
representation
of
this
style

little
pils

very

a
little
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
pilsner
overalll
a
very
nice
flavor
profile
that
goes
great
with
excellent
drinkability
this
is
the
first
brew
ive
tried
by
sly
fox
and
id
sure
like
to
see
what
else
they
have
o
a
great
craft
pils
one
of
my
new
favorites
glad
that
this
is
local
beer
as
ill
surely
be
having
more
o
great
drinkability
and
its
in
a
can
so
its
great
for
summer
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
and
i
could
easily
have
another
without
hesitation
as
i
have
in
the
past
ill
continue
to
include
this
beer
in
its
rotation
along
with
some
of
the
other
favorite
pils
style
beers
so
there
is
no
question
ill
be
having
this
beer
again
o
very
refrsehing
nice
flavor
this
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
someone
in
quebec
would
make
something
similar
to
this
and
others
like
prima
pils
you
got
a
heineken
loving
friend
have
him
try
this
help
him
understand
what
his
beer
drinking
life
could
be
like
o
the
beer
has
some
crisp
refreshing
properties
and
would
be
a
good
aperitif

accompaniment

with
a
crisp
carbonation
and
a
light
acidity
from
sip
to
swallow
all
and
all
a
solid
pilsener
in
my
humble
opinion
generally
not
a
go
to
style
for
me
but
i
would
drink
this
regularly
if
i
had
regular
access
a
good
entry
to
the
pilsner
category
it
doesnt
have
the
softness
that
i
associate
with
this
style
the
hop
bitterness
in
particular
is
more
harsh
than
one
would
expect
o
a
very
refreshing
offering
and
a
great
choice
for
the
summer
moreys
bottom
liine
definitely
not
a
classic
example
of
the
style
but
its
a
nice
american
twist
on
a
fairly
predictable
style
almost
taste
like
a
pale
ale
normally
i
can
tell
a
lager
from
an
ale
with
incredible
ease
but
this
ones
a
little
tough
o
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
guy
but
i
enjoyed
this
very
drinkable
and
would
go
good
with
fried
foods
also
good
for
grilling
or
a
hot
day
o
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
pilsner
and
in
a
can
i
would
certainly
pick
this
up
for
summer
parties
as
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
poured
a
light
pale
yellow
color
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
lots
of
foam
and
head
retention
great
retention
leaving
lots
of
sticky
lace
smell
was
light
but
had
nice
aroma
of
lemon
citrus
and
grass
hop
flavors
the
taste
was
just
very
good
smooth
and
refreshing
actually
had
lots
of
hop
character
slight
pine
and
grapefruit
dry
clean
finish
very
good
example
of
this
classic
german
style
to
steal
a
line
from
woodys
canquest
i
would
have
lots
of
these
in
my
virtual
cooler
for
the
summer
months
o
if
you
cant
tell
i
like
this
really
like
it
id
been
stuck
in
bmc
hell
when
it
came
to
canned
beer
now
that
i
have
choices
wow
sly
fox
is
on
my
radar
now
and
has
made
my
hit
list
with
a
traditionalstyle
german
pilsner
in
a
can
of
all
things
i
used
to
have
to
get
swill
in
the
can
but
with
the
oscar
revolution
as
i
refer
to
it
everything
is
changing
this
will
be
my
summer
crushem
and
recycleem
beer
from
here
on
out
if
i
can
keep
getting
it
drinkability
not
the
worst
beer
i
ever
had
not
really
impressive
though
the
bitter
finish
is
less
than
pleasant
and
lingers
perhaps
the
fact
that
is
came
in
a
can
has
something
to
do
with
this
the
flavor
is
that
of
a
wellbuilt
pilsner
with
dry
malt
notes
mineral
water
and
grassy
hop
bitterness
pikeland
could
stand
to
turn
down
the
ibus
just
a
touch
but
that
is
a
minor
nitpick
crisp
carbonation
level
with
big
bubbles
that
roll
across
the
palate
sharp
drying
finish
leaves
bitter
grass
notes
on
the
back
of
the
palate
overall
a
tasty
beer
from
sly
fox
and
one
i
would
gladly
reach
for
again
if
given
the
chance
ample
dry
hop
bitterness
floral
and
very
grassy
in
the
finish
dry
lingering
grass
notes
really
hang
on
noticeable
a
minute
or
two
after
taking
a
sip
some
cracker
and
white
bread
in
the
middle
balance
things
out
moderate
carbonation
low
enough
to
suggest
germaneuro
style
origins
body
is
light
and
quenching
seems
like
a
good
warm
weather
session
beer
thanks
mike
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
a
good
tasteing
beer
and
i
always
worry
when
it
comes
to
canned
beer
old
stereotypes
are
hard
to
break
d
while
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
this
is
much
better
than
some
of
the
other
versions
out
there
ive
had
definitely
better
than
a
bmc
option
in
this
one
though
the
yeast
isnt
integrated
enough
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
and
competes
and
drowns
out
what
should
be
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
i
drank
it
and
i
didnt
dislike
it
but
it
just
didnt
work
out
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
good
it
had
some
nice
balance
and
flavors
to
it
it
was
clean
and
crisp
and
a
nice
version
of
the
style
d
good
not
the
best
pils
ive
ever
had
but
this
is
very
drinkable
and
affordable
at
that
id
pick
this
up
for
any
event
i
couldnt
bring
glass
bottles
a
bit
fuller
and
hoppier
than
a
real
german
pils
second
place
behind
prima
but
ahead
of
sunshine
among
hoppedup
american
versions
of
the
style
mouthfeel
is
light
effervescent
tiny
bubbles
no
stickiness
at
all
very
easy
to
drink
far
too
quickly
have
to
remember
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
d
this
would
be
a
great
all
night
beer
when
hanging
out
and
watching
football
flavorful
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
but
not
so
much
so
that
it
becomes
overwhelming
truly
a
beautiful
simple
beer
nicely
done
good
drink
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
maybe
not
spoton
to
style
but
tasty
nonetheless
pours
goldenyellow
with
a
rocky
off
white
head
lemony
citrus
nose
with
some
grassy
undertones
palate
is
unique
and
tasty
cracker
malts
have
good
balance
from
a
strong
bitter
bite
finish
not
as
clean
and
crisp
as
it
could
be
drinkability
is
high
from
start
to
finish
traditional
or
not
this
is
a
worthy
pils
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
this
were
available
here
on
tap
this
is
one
of
the
cleanest
and
freshest
tasting
beers
i
have
had
this
one
is
a
perfect
session
ale
great
for
the
style
drinkability
is
really
where
this
beer
shines
i
think
it
goes
down
in
gulps
and
the
levels
are
such
that
i
dont
think
you
could
ever
get
sick
of
it
great
job
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
magnificent
and
quickly
proliferating
thick
white
head
that
eventually
breaks
apart
in
shifts
leaving
prolific
arcs
of
lace
behind
smells
lemony
with
a
bit
of
malty
sweetness
some
dry
hay
and
a
bit
of
spice
initial
notes
of
lemon
and
orange
float
on
the
palate
with
a
some
resinous
hops
resting
underneath
a
bit
of
graininess
exists
along
with
some
orange
peel
this
tasty
brew
is
dry
on
the
edges
and
creamy
in
the
middle
which
makes
for
some
kickass
drinking
if
i
could
find
this
beer
locally
i
would
definitely
have
found
my
new
favorite
session
brew
the
beer
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
nice
i
get
some
bready
malt
along
with
some
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
pilsener
malt
grassy
hops
and
a
medium
amount
of
bitterness
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
german
pilsener
straw
yellow
with
one
finger
of
white
head
that
had
good
retention
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
herbal
grassy
hops
dominate
the
aroma
this
seems
to
be
a
very
hoppy
pilsener
from
the
aroma
and
so
it
is
in
flavor
as
well
all
44
ibus
can
be
tasted
very
herbal
and
grassy
that
made
the
first
sip
a
bit
of
a
surprise
it
seems
to
get
tamer
the
deeper
in
the
glass
i
get
the
malt
is
dry
and
cracker
like
light
body
with
abundant
carbonation
that
stops
short
of
being
harsh
just
like
a
pilsener
should
be
a
light
dry
pilsner
that
has
more
hops
than
just
about
any
other
beer
of
this
style
i
have
encountered
d
its
a
pretty
average
german
pilsener
with
some
ups
and
downs
ill
probably
forget
all
about
tomorrow
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
maltiness
and
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
taste
a
clean
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
bavarian
hop
a
small
bite
and
a
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
bavarian
hop
aftertaste
refreshing
and
clean
somewhat
like
a
standard
pils
with
all
that
hop
jazz
going
on
youd
think
itd
drink
like
an
ipa
however
the
malt
meat
is
light
and
distinctive
pilsner
essences
are
found
underneath
the
elements
are
balanced
fairly
well
overall
as
the
beer
bursts
with
flavor
an
accessible
and
interesting
twist
on
the
style
d
here
is
where
i
think
this
shines
the
most
very
clean
dry
with
the
grains
being
the
highlight
of
the
drink
with
just
enough
hop
indication
to
be
appreciable
to
those
who
like
an
added
punch
to
their
pils
maybe
not
so
much
as
victorys
prima
but
still
a
nice
compliment
exceptionally
smooth
going
down
and
down
and
down
keg
worthy
d
seems
like
this
one
has
been
getting
some
hate
lately
but
i
really
quite
enjoyed
it
a
nice
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
pils
the
taste
really
showcases
a
punch
of
herbal
hops
right
off
the
bat
and
i
am
still
getting
this
mild
rubber
aspect
that
is
not
altogether
displeasing
but
i
am
sure
it
is
from
the
hops
malts
are
very
light
and
i
would
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
no
specialty
malts
were
used
in
this
beer
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
are
about
equal
and
the
finish
is
quite
dry
good
pilsner
pa
folks
are
lucky
to
have
so
many
poured
from
12
oz
can
into
my
pint
class
forms
a
very
high
head
that
sticks
for
a
few
minutes
and
slowly
fades
away
satisfactory
lacing
but
nothing
spectacular
the
color
is
a
clear
and
light
orange
and
only
slight
carbonation
the
smell
initially
reminded
me
of
the
bmcs
but
after
the
head
subsided
i
was
able
to
get
a
whiff
of
pleasant
malt
and
some
sweetness
slightly
bitter
i
taste
none
of
the
malt
and
sweetness
that
i
got
from
the
smell
just
the
bitterness
very
thin
on
the
palate
and
almost
no
aftertaste
this
beer
is
only
slightly
a
cut
above
a
miller
genuine
draft
ive
had
other
sly
fox
beers
and
expected
a
lot
more
from
this
one
i
could
probably
drink
a
ton
of
these
as
my
drink
of
choice
for
beer
pong
d
pretty
tasty
and
easy
to
down
but
overall
lacking
in
effort
d
drinks
very
nicely
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
pretty
pils
no
aroma
that
really
hurts
but
other
than
that
another
great
addition
to
the
american
craft
pils
scene
a
darker
blonde
pils
clear

popping
dryness
roundabout
lacing
rides
the
glass
a
touch
of
urquell
in
the
nose
and
a
simple
yet
elegant
malt
approach
i
like
it
im
glad
to
see
another
top
notch
pils
around
town
shyfox
i
salute
you
taste
is
quite
tame
as
well
its
got
some
light
sulfur
thats
refreshing
and
sweet
light
hoppiness
is
really
good
overall
its
a
great
beer
for
the
style
d
you
could
tell
the
effort
was
good
just
didnt
really
follow
through
about
one
modest
step
above
any
bmc
offering
only
went
down
somewhat
quickly
to
get
to
something
different
d
a
very
nice
session
beer
if
im
allowed
to
use
that
here
these
days
this
is
probably
my
second
favorite
american
pils
just
behind
prima
pils
this
is
well
worth
seeking
out
the
closest
thing
along
with
victory
prima
pils
to
the
real
german
pilsners
nothing
can
really
match
the
originals
or
the
freshness
when
had
on
tap
in
germany
but
the
pikeland
pils
is
really
good
pretty
darn
authentic
d
drinkability
is
high
even
for
style
easy
to
drink
extremely
sessionable
i
wouldnt
put
this
up
with
prima
pils
from
victory
but
its
a
good
stab
at
the
style
d
i
really
love
it
when
an
american
brewery
nails
this
style
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
pils
and
you
dont
have
to
pay
for
it
to
be
imported
pretty
drinkable
yet
another
solid
pils
from
pa
d
easy
drinker
and
crisp
flavors
make
it
a
sure
bet
overall
a
nice
pils
and
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
one
very
easy
drinking
goes
down
quickly
d
they
almost
dont
get
more
drinkable
than
this
but
the
noted
carbonation
is
the
only
thing
stopping
me
from
gulping
this
brew
down
very
very
nice
lives
up
to
the
pa
hype
i
usually
do
not
expect
a
whole
lot
from
pilseners
but
this
beer
really
blew
me
away
like
the
other
offerings
i
have
tried
from
sly
fox
pikeland
pils
was
amazingly
flavorful
and
remarkably
drinkable
well
done
and
just
as
i
finish
gushing
about
the
nice
warm
weather
the
heavens
open
up
and
unleash
a
couple
huge
claps
of
thunder
oh
well
pikeland
pils
goes
well
with
thunderstorms
too
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
hints
of
honey
with
a
nice
and
fluffy
pure
white
head
seems
to
be
a
shade
darker
than
most
pils
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malts
a
bit
bready
and
light
grassy
hops
a
touch
sweeter
than
expected
the
taste
seems
to
be
spot
on
for
a
german
pils
a
light
cracker
like
malt
with
some
bitter
stale
grassy
noble
hops
a
bit
metallic
and
hints
of
honey
seems
to
be
more
bitter
than
most
pils
and
dry
perhaps
this
is
a
take
on
the
northern
german
pils
like
jever
a
solid
body
holds
well
on
the
palate
very
dry
with
a
bitter
finish
typical
pils
a
nice
example
of
the
style
dryer
and
a
tad
more
bitter
than
most
gets
a
plus
for
being
in
a
can
recommended
goes
down
easy
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
even
taking
into
account
that
this
is
a
rather
basic
and
understated
beer
style
this
beer
just
didnt
do
anything
for
me
d
quite
an
enjoyable
brew
the
can
really
fits
the
image
and
makes
it
the
perfect
bbq
brew
ive
had
several
sly
fox
now
and
theyve
all
been
good
experiences
looking
forward
to
trying
a
few
other
of
their
brews
highly
recommended
for
the
summer
bbq
season
give
it
a
shot
could
definitely
knock
several
of
these
back
nice
cans
i
like
this
very
much
its
quite
hoppy
and
the
can
im
drinking
is
less
than
a
month
from
its
best
by
date
which
tells
me
that
its
probably
even
hoppier
fresh
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
come
to
this
beer
but
i
will
certainly
be
coming
back
for
more
overall
a
very
tasty
brew
that
fits
its
style
well
a
nice
light
body
with
a
mild
abv
that
give
this
brew
an
easy
drinkability
and
a
very
sessionable
one
at
that
and
it
comes
in
a
can
which
makes
it
poolside
friendly
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
bit
dry
crisply
carbonated
but
not
too
much
so
nicely
done
poured
a
super
clear
golden
yellow
color
the
frothy
white
head
was
chunky
and
uneven
smell
is
full
of
tasty
bitterings
hop
and
a
surprisingly
sweet
light
malt
aroma
refreshing
and
fairly
light
perfect
for
a
session
taste
is
biscuity
hop
flavor
is
earthy
and
peppery
this
is
an
excellently
balanced
pils
feel
is
moderate
to
light
with
a
slick
stickiness
perfect
for
a
long
can
session
now
all
i
need
is
a
6
pack
overall
a
great
pilsner
that
if
i
had
easy
access
to
it
i
would
buy
it
more
often
but
im
not
going
to
waste
a
trade
trying
to
get
it
d
this
would
be
very
serviceable
as
a
goto
beer
for
summer
sessioning
perfect
for
cooking
out
or
whatever
nice
drinkability
is
good
pretty
good
balance
though
the
bitterness
feels
a
touch
high
light
and
refreshing
this
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
d
a
german
pilsner
should
certainly
have
some
staying
power
and
this
is
a
type
of
beer
i
could
be
drinking
pint
after
pint
nice
balance
of
flavors
a
crisp
enough
bitterness
combined
with
a
pleasing
dry
finish
help
render
this
beers
fantastic
drinkability
sly
fox
pikeland
pils
is
a
very
clear
straw
colored
beer
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
pretty
rapidly
the
aroma
is
soft
fruity
and
wooden
there
may
be
a
note
of
lemon
it
is
thin
crisp
and
dry
on
the
palate
the
bitterness
is
nice
it
tastes
fresh
fruity
wooden
and
resiny
pretty
darn
good
for
a
pilsner
in
a
can
drinkability
high
pours
a
very
transparent
yellow
color
with
a
large
slightly
sticky
white
head
standard
nose
of
grassy
hop
bitterness
and
subtle
pale
malts
with
looming
aromas
of
machine
funk
the
hop
character
is
definitely
dominant
in
the
nose
but
instead
of
a
fresh
hop
blast
im
getting
more
of
a
stale
hop
dud
the
pale
malt
semi
structure
falls
a
bit
thin
and
out
of
balance
the
body
is
thin
and
the
carbonation
is
bright
the
largest
downer
to
this
beer
is
the
overly
bitter
and
plantlike
aftertaste
i
do
not
recommend
d
great
pils
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
especially
with
the
higher
ibus
and
advanced
hop
character
not
my
style
of
choice
but
this
was
really
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
german
pils
from
sly
fox
a
nice
drinker
in
a
nice
looking
can
pours
a
lightgolden
color
with
a
very
sturdy
looking
twofinger
head
fades
slowly
into
a
14
layer
of
foam
and
leaves
behind
thick
sheets
of
lacing
lots
of
pungent
hop
aroma
slightly
floralherbal
very
clean
tasting
beer
slightly
bready
tasting
through
the
middle
but
very
hopforward
beer
aspirinlike
hoppy
bitterness
crisp
as
hell
refreshing
and
with
a
ton
of
lingering
bitterness
this
is
nice
glad
i
got
the
chance
nice
overall
but
a
bit
less
hops
would
be
more
to
my
liking
wow
microbrew
in
a
can
it
pours
a
crisp
golden
cear
with
2
finger
head
that
fades
after
a
few
minutes
lots
of
citrus
hops
in
the
aroma
and
much
more
in
the
taste
very
crisp
and
very
tasty
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
creamier
than
expected
drinkability
very
high
it
travels
well
in
a
can
and
therefore
is
allowed
in
many
more
places
such
as
festivals
and
the
like
way
to
go
slyfox
havent
had
that
many
cans
of
east
coast
microbrew
this
one
is
great
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
smells
of
grainy
malts
and
some
fruit
tastes
pretty
good
just
not
my
style
but
i
guess
right
on
for
the
style
nice
bittering
hops
at
the
end
finishing
slightly
dry
a
clean
and
crisp
beer
for
the
summertime
overall
a
solid
pils
that
i
definitely
wish
i
had
more
of
do
a
great
offering
from
sly
fox
that
is
bound
to
please
craft
and
macro
drinkers
alike
a
great
summer
session
beer
and
the
cans
make
it
easy
to
take
with
you
on
the
road
yet
another
shining
example
of
a
great
german
pilsener
made
in
pa
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thicker
creme
head
nose
is
clean
and
extremely
mild
a
barely
noticed
sweetness
to
it
flavor
is
smooth
and
clean
nice
sweet
overtone
and
an
earthy
back
tone
doesnt
really
bring
much
complexity
but
its
smooth
and
east
drinking
good
for
a
hot
day
or
a
starter
d
a
very
drinkable
pils
one
of
my
favorites
from
the
style
glad
to
try
some
sly
fox
wish
i
didnt
have
to
pour
so
much
down
the
drain
when
it
foamed
out
overall
its
easy
to
put
one
of
these
down
and
reminds
me
a
lot
of
trumer
pils
an
in
your
face
pilsner
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
refreshing
cant
wait
to
crack
open
my
phoenix
pale
ale
tomorrow
night
an
excellent
summertime
pilsner
bracing
clean
pils
hop

with
nice
maltiness
the
crispness
and
bitterness
hit
full
on
start
to
finish
exceptionally
clean
and
refreashing
great
job
nailed
the
style
perfect
to
anjoy
several
of
these
on
a
warm
day
i
love
that
this
comes
in
cans
too
so
convenient
12oz

a

with
1

of

head
that
dissipates
leaving

with
a
hint
of
lager
yeastiness
taste
is
initially
sweet
with
the

coming
through
in
the

with

nice

beer
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
clear
light
straw
yellow
with
a
light
two
finger
white
head
that
quickly
descends
to
a
thin
whispy
layer
of
bubbles
not
much
webbing
to
speak
of
noble
hops
and
sweet
caramel
malt
in
the
nose
up
front
some
buttery
biscuits
lemongrass
and
a
hint
of
pepper
in
the
nose
as
well
decent
aroma
but
very
faint
taste
is
a
lemon
peel
up
front
with
a
bready
malt
as
well
very
clean
hops
that
leave
the
mouth
fairly
dry
buttery
biscuits
towards
the
end
with
an
earthlike
hop
aftertaste
light
and
refreshing

with
a
lively

great
summer
session
beer
i
really
wish
i
picked
up
a
sixpack
of
this
instead
of
a
single
if
youre
looking
for
a
hoppy
low
abv
lager
this
is
one
of
the
best
ill
defintely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
one
soon
for
my
next
golf
outing
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
ton
of
this
i
need
to
track
down
a
fresher
stash
poured
this
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
pours
a
nice
yellow
color
with
a
1
inch
tight
white
head
that
fades
and
leaves
a
layer
of
foam
on
top
of
the
brew
the
smell
is
typical
of
a
pilsner
a
little
malt
and
a
sulphury
smell
but
it
has
a
noticeable
hop
presence
that
is
very
nice
the
taste
is
just
right
you
get
a
nice
bit
of
the
traditional
sulphury
pilsner
taste
down
the
middle
of
the
palate
and
then
sweet
malt
corn
and
flavorful
hops
on
the
side
its
actually
even
got
a
nice
mouthfeel
for
a
pils
i
could
drink
this
one
all
summer
long
outside
in
the
hot
texas
sun
it
is
extremely
refreshing
this
is
most
definitely
my
favorite
pilsner
and
i
am
typically
not
a
fan
of
the
style
i
like
this
but
there
are
better
pilsners
made
in
our
great

i
really
like
the
flavor
and

combo
of
this
particular
brew
this
is
one
that
i
will
be
serving
if
i
have
a
party
of
beer
heathens
very
good
stuff
its
superb
drinkability
and
the
genuinely
good
not
superb
flavor
makes
this
a
big
winner
in
my
book
poured
a
light
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
fizzy
white
head
i
had
to
actually
wait
to
pour
the
rest
in
the
glass
cans
give
awesome
head
retention
i
must
say
the
head
had
a
nice
slow
fade
and
left
behind
lots
of
lace
this
color
was
very
very
bright
and
had
lots
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
smell
was
very
light
and
crisp
smelled
very
lively
nice
light
lemon
and
grass
flavors
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
grain
the
taste
was
just
great
smooth
big
carbonation
made
it
very
refreshing
very
very
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
with
a
nice
pine
resin
flavor
and
hints
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
and
lemon
big
dry
finish
that
was
nice
and
bitter
this
was
awesome
and
really
awoke
a
rekindling
of
the
pilsner
i
normally
find
them
a
bit
bland
but
this
has
renewed
my
intrest
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
again
in
the
warmer
months
to
come
worth
as
shot
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsner
especially
nice
to
see
another
good
crafted
beer
coming
out
of
a
can
the
beer
pours
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
good
pale
and
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
mild
german
hop
aroma
its
light
and
refreshing
but
a
little
sweeter
than
most
its
not
as
crisp
as
a
traditional
pils
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
its
got
a
wonderful
hop
bitterness
along
with
a
solid
malt
bill
my
problem
is
that
its
too
hoppy
and
malty
i
like
a
lighter
pils
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
aggressive
imo
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
drinker
but
its
just
an
above
average
pils
nothing
special
a
solid
refreshing
pilsener
overall
what
a
good
pilsener
should
be
and
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
feel
is
fizzy
but
smooth
at
the
swallow
the
feel
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
its
actually
as
it
warms
up
but
not
great
overall
its
a
rather
musty
pils
d
certainly
a
beer
that
is
suitable
for
most
any
occasion
you
can
drink
this
all
day
and
night
finish

crazy
checki
seem
to
be
right
on
or
the
low
side
compared
to
other
reviews
several
noted
the
hoppy
character
for
the
style
which
is
nice
but
the
smell
and
the
fact
that
the
taste
suffers
after
warming
even
for
a
short
time
keep
me
from
pushing
the
score
higher
my
ratings
of
sly
fox
are
always
higher
on
site
when
ive
been
there
so
might
try
this
one
there
next
trip
to
compare
on
draft
d
a
poor
match
with
my
dinner
but
a
pleasant
enough
brew
for
the
summer
d
this
is
baseball
tailgating
beer
not
too
strong
but
very
easy
to
put
down
three
or
four
or
more
before
you
go
to
the
game
the
cans
really
make
this
a
portable
beer
as
well
nothing
is
as
pronounced
in
the
taste
with
the
exception
of
the
nip
from
the
leafy
dry
hops
a
seltzery
texture
just
a
twinge
on
the
way
down
easy
as
water
just
a
good
classic
simple
pils
longing
to
be
stowed
away
on
a
long
trip
to
the
beach
with
the
recent
price
increase
i
guess
8
50
is
decent
for
a
sixer
something
like
7
49
would
be
perfect
thanks
again

want
in
a
pils
crisp

drinkable

easily
make
a
great
session

especially
during
the
summer
months
when
you
want
something
that
is
light
but
full
flavored
right
up
there
with
prima

and
sunshine

great
summer
beer
a
well
made
nicely
balanced
pils
first
time
that
i
have
seen
this
at
my
normal
beer
stop
so
decided
to
pick
up
their
pils
offering
brew
poured
from
the
can
to
a
clear
light
golden
color
maybe
more
yellow
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
had
some
retention
which
left
some
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
the
aroma
is
very
nice
has
a
snap
to
it
which
i
would
imagine
come
from
saaz
hops
while
the
hop
note
is
the
most
noticeable
i
am
also
able
to
pick
up
a
doughybiscuit
sweet
scent
the
taste
is
nice
very
fresh
feel
highlighting
grass
slightly
citrus
with
a
biscuit
malt
taste
though
that
seemed
to
be
more
evident
in
the
aroma
over
all
this
is
a
very
nice
pils
one
that
i
will
get
again
during
the
summer
months
i
think
it
is
a
bonus
that
it
is
in
a
can
since
it
is
such
a
good
drinking
beer
will
be
great
for
those
summer
excursions
pours
a
hazy
yellowy
gold
effervescent
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
and
laces
on
the
way
aroma
is
a
nice
clean
lemony
sweetness
not
a
tart
lemon
but
a
soft
sweetness
slightly
grainy
and
grassy
as
well
light
soft
lemony
sweetness
hits
up
front
in
the
taste
a
rubber
and
grassy
bitter
hoppiness
comes
in
midway
and
lingers
into
the
dry
finish
light
to
medium
in
body
not
extremely
crisp
but
a
small
amount
of
pepperiness
and
a
good
sized
dryness
in
the
finish
very
nice
clean
tasting
beer
highly
sessionable
and
being
packaged
in
a
can
could
make
this
an
ideal
summer
camping
beer
big
thanks
go
out
to
nutbrown
for
this
sample
drinkability
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
the
usual
pils
i
like
but
this
is
one
of
the
most
flavorful
ones
i
have
had
very
tasty
and
quenching
i
was
a
bit
hesitant
going
into
this
after
my
fist
beer
from
sly
fox
pale
ale
bleach
but
this
one
impressed
me
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
very
hazy
grassy
yellow
waaay
too
much
head
but
man
it
was
lovely
fades
away
after
quite
a
while
lacing
in
mounds
sheets
heaps
and
traces
all
kinds
of
stuff
going
on
aroma
is
full
of
grassy
herbal
noble
hops
a
little
bit
of
malt
pretty
decent
taste
is
better
the
noble
hops
are
done
better
balance
is
better
citrus
is
nicer
grassy
herbal
hop
tones
are
nice
but
also
a
little
metallic
twang
to
it
that
was
a
little
distracting
mouth
is
good
and
carbonation
is
high
and
overall
its
just
a
pretty
good
and
drinkable
beer
cheers
thanks
dr
jay
for
bringing
up
good
small
head
on
lighter
yellow
a
nice
bitterness
and
drinkability
at
44
ibu
clean
and
fresh
and
refreshing
unfiltered
gives
it
a
cloudiness
and
a
tad
complexity
to
the
aroma
more
than
the
flavour
carbonation
about
right
drinkability
is
affected
negatively
by
the
taste
bud
mugging
but
its
light
and
fizzy
enough
to
create
a
party
in
the
oral
cavity
not
one
of
their
worst
beers
by
any
means
but
not
something
ill
bust
my
ass
to
get
glad
i
tried
it
could
knock
back
a
few
of
these
especially
during
the
summer
months
a
very
good
pilsener
d
so
easy
to
drink
an
excellent
pilsner
8
for
a
6
pack
at
whole
foods
in
manhattan
yeah
i
went
for
it
and
id
do
it
again
pretty
solid
stuff
pretty
flavorful
and
overall
pretty
easy
to
drink
just
not
as
drinkable
as
other
examples
of
the
style
this
pils
poured
a
clear
gold
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
and
coated
the
inside
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
bready
malt
with
noble
hops
a
very
german
pils
aroma
the
taste
was
bready
malt
and
noble
floral
hops
with
mild
hop
bitterness
a
good
lager
flavor
overall
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
carbonation
the
hops
lingered
nicely
in
the
aftertaste
this
was
a
very
very
good
and
enjoyable
german
pils
ive
heard
people
recommend
this
to
beer
noobs
but
i
dont
think
id
do
the
same
the
flavor
is
really
all
in
the
bitterness
so
if
youre
not
into
that
tough
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
formed
a
1
34
eggshell
head
over
the
slightly
cloudy
light
golden
yellow
brew
head
froths
down
at
a
reasonable
rate
with
ample
delicate
lacing
aroma
is
sweet
pale
maybe
a
bit
chalky
with
a
bit
of
a
hops
tinge
flavor
is
also
sweet
to
start
but
mostly
defined
by
an
amorphous
bitterness
that
fills
the
mouth
and
closes
chalky
mouthfeel
doesnt
do
much
for
me
but
theres
not
much
debate
that
if
you
like
it
you
could
keep
on
drinking
it
still
a
better
can
option
than
swill
easily
light
wheat
color
with
a
slight
head
white
with
a
touch
of
lacing
some
spicy
malt
marzen
in
the
nose
tiny
little
bit
of
green
hops
as
well
the
taste
is
totally
hop
forward
not
ipa
huge
but
still
announcing
its
presence
with
authority
finishes
slightly
bitter
and
lingering
but
also
really
refreshing
good
session
beer
nice
blonde
color
a
little
hazy
but
not
much
head
retention
although
not
bad
for
a
pilsner
light
smell
of
clean
german
hops
nothing
outstanding
or
overpowering
but
very
nice
in
a
subdued
way
taste
is
a
mix
of
citrusy
hops
with
a
twinge
of
honey
sweetness
tart
lipsmacking
bitterness
i
could
probably
have
quite
a
few
of
these
im
not
an
expert
on
pils
but
this
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
little
beverage
overall
a
nice
quaffable

d
very

even
with
the
restrained

character
good
for
a
lazy
summer
beach
day
this
poured
with
a
huge
fluffy
offwhite
head
that
threatened
to
spill
over
the
sides
of
the
glass
before
settlling
back
down
the
color
was
a
slightly
cloudy
lemonyellow
and
the
nose
was
absolutely
fragrant
with
saaz
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
bitterness
on
the
palate
on
the
finish
i
noticed
a
brief
malt
sweetness
followed
closely
by
the
return
of
the
same
bitterness
noted
before
it
was
the
hops
that
really
lingered
the
relatively
low
abv
makes
it
a
highly
drinkable
beer
especially
as
an
alternative
to
hefeweizens
on
a
hot
day
this
one
was
on
nolangti
clearly
labeled
on
the
can
that
this
was
produced
and
canned
at
the
royersford
locale
so
here
it
goes
after
stopping
in
at
mad
mex
looking
for
some
sly
fox
draft
products
i
saw
the
beer
list
that
said
sly
fox
cans
new
and
i
was
like
i
take
one
of
each
for
eight
bucks
ouch
i
wanted
to
taste
the
can
product
before
diving
into
a
case
so
here
it
goes
appears
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
hue
forms
a
rocky
large
white
head
leaves
magnificant
fine
even
layers
of
lacing
done
my
pint
glass
aroma
is
full
of
noble
saaz
galore
very
hoppy
aromatic
herbally
goodness
with
biscuit
mineral
malt
character
very
nice
mix
of
tones
coming
to
my
senses
taste
is
slightly
grassy
with
a
mix
of
citrus
peels
in
there
as
well
mineral
water
with
all
of
the
herbal
hops
and
light
toasted
malts
bring
a
biscuit
crisp
mild
sweetness
but
overall
this
canned
product
finishes
nice
and
dry
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
by
no
means
though
is
this
one
thin
or
watery
crisp
carbonation
capable
of
tickling
the
back
of
the
throat
but
not
overly
bitey
very
smooth
on
the
palate
drinkability
what
can
be
said
some
one
has
brewed
an
incredibly
tasty
and
drinkable
pils
and
offered
in
cans
thank
the
beer
gods
for
those
guys
out
in
the
philly
suburbs
oh
yeah
and
if
your
interested
and
i
went
along
and
picked
up
a
case
for
25
bucks
great
investment
youll
love
the
packaging
little
mini
cases
each
with
12
cans
cute
this
one
was
alright
ive
enjoyed
the
sly
fox
bottled
brews
quite
a
bit
but
have
been
somewhat
underwhelmed
by
their
canned
offerings
thusfar
a
very
clean
taste
i
get
some
hops
just
enough
overall
one
of
the
best
usproduced
german
pilseners
available

youre

right
about

this

finger
of

with
yellow
body
good
carbonation
dry
bitter
smell
taste
is
hoppy
and
dry
at
first
but
it
doesnt
linger
crisp
as
advertised
very
good
beer
just
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
so
bitter
but
i
shouldve
noticed
the
44
ibu
on
the
label
which
is
fine
but
just
not
expected
more
of
an
ipa
to
me
than
a
pilsner
but
lighter
good
beer
but
i
like
other
pilsners
more
not
my
style
the
name
sounds
do
good
but
the
beer
falls
flat
got
some
hay
smell
and
nothing
else
taste
just
bland
with
a
earthly
hop
finish
o
good
beer
not
one
of
6points
better
offerings
though
definitely
prefer
sweet
action
to
it
an
excellent
pilsner
i
cant
believe
it
took
so
long
for
me
to
try
this
clean
pilz
flavor
with
a
nice
hop
presence
which
is
standard
for
sixpoint
at
this
point
will
definitely
become
a
year
round
in
my
fridge
thanks
sixpoint
for
another
amazing
beer
that
takes
up
little
fridge
space
overall
ok
brew
i
would
have
again
if
i
was
offered
best
beer
from
six
point
whether
its
the
brewery
or
the
ba
sixpoint
rocks
unlike
many
american
pilsenerstyle
beers
this
retains
the
classic
feel
and
drinkability
of
an
old
world
example
but
has
some
american
hop
character
as
well
eminently
drinkable
i
could
consume
this
all
day
when
the
summer
weather
is
here
i
know
ill
miss
having
this
on
hand
o
great
taste
for
a
pilsner
but
mouthfeel
not
what
expected
in
a
pilsner
would
be
a
4
if
it
was
a
light
ipa
but
calling
it
a
pilsner
doesnt
seem
right
still
great
smell
with
an
even
greater
taste
good
pils
nothing
special
no
bad
though
would
purchase
again
one
of
the
best
pilseners
and
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
ever
had
hands
down
these
cats
can
brew
awesome
beer
my
favorite
pilzzz
one
of
the
better
pilsners
out
there
that
you
can
buy
nationally
thin
watery
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
a
bit
of
a
bananay
taste
from
the
yeasts
also
so
hop
aftertaste
probably
wouldnt
buy
again
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
consumed
id
rather
redrink
my
own
puke
horrible
horrible
and
it
is
a
lager
not
a
pilsner
delightful
aromanose
developed
hoppy
body
finish
there
may
be
a
decent
pilsner
hiding
somewhere
beneath
the
piney
hop
haze
but
its
impossible
to
tell
any
mention
of
pilz
or
pilsner
on
this
beers
labeling
is
misleading
not
a
bad
beer
just
not
a
great
one
came
flying
out
as
soon
as
i
cracked
open
the
can
but
i
caught
it
all
in
my
goblet
of
course
this
resulted
in
a
beautiful
1
foamy
head
typical
aroma
that
you
would
expect
from
a
german
pilsener
flavor
wise
there
is
nothing
surprising
here
its
just
a
very
clean
refreshing
pilsener
very
drinkable
went
down
very
easy
looking
forward
to
my
next
beer
from
sixpoint
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
descends
to
a
scummy
coating
ok
retention
a
touch
of
lacing
the
smell
and
the
flavor
are
both
flatly
breadybitter
really
clean
fresh
aroma
with
some
herbalcitric
hop
smells
the
flavor
is
bracing
with
green
herbal
hop
characteristics
almost
like
mint
or
basil
there
is
some
definitely
clean
malt
and
yeast
character
to
it
super
drinkable
with
a
light
body
and
a
medium
finish
in
kind
of
hangs
around
but
is
pretty
clean
excellent
pilsener
stays
true
to
being
fairly
inoffensive
and
drinkable
while
still
cramming
in
some
flavor
from
the
europeantasting
hops
would
have
again
excellent
good
beer
for
pale
lager
lovers
this
beer
truly
lives
up
to
its
name
the
pour
is
a
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
that
dissipates
quickly
the
smell
is
light
but
has
distinct
floral
hop
notes
and
some
light
malt
sweetness
the
taste
was
a
quick
bite
from
the
hops
and
malt
that
mellowed
and
had
a
bright
finish
with
little
aftertaste
making
it
a
very
refreshing
beer
would
highly
recommend
bought
a
sixer
of
this
a
couple
days
ago
and
have
really
enjoyed
it
the
name
gets
it
right
it
is
very
crisp
with
a
citrusy
grapefruit
aroma
on
the
pour
the
head
is
full
but
dissipates
quickly
on
the
first
sip
the
grapefruit
taste
comes
thru
with
some
mild
bitterness
that
ends
in
a
clean
finish
all
in
all
deeelicious
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
almost
no
lacing
on
the
glass
from
the
smell
you
can
tell
this
is
a
lager
but
it
has
a
nice
amount
of
hoppiness
very
citrusy
taste
is
like
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
a
pale
ale
you
get
that
smooth
bready
malt
up
front
with
a
nice
hop
bite
in
the
finish
grapefruit
maybe
some
pine
and
fruity
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
awesome
really
light
and
not
overly
carbonated
goes
down
easy
and
really
drinkable
overall
a
very
solid
beer
sixpoint
can
do
no
wrong
in
my
eyes
these
guys
just
put
out
awesome
stuff
rather
tasty
for
such
a
light
beer
but
its
got
an
offputting
whiff
of
ammonia
that
reminds
me
of
cleaning
out
a
cats
litter
box
overall
what
a
delightful
pilsner
simply
one
of
the
best
american
pilsners
on
the
market
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
an
exceptional
german
style
pilsner
that
lives
well
up
to
its
name
this
brew
has
a
lot
of
flavor
body
but
a
misnomer
for
a
name
crisp
is
nowhere
in
sight
this
may
be
someones
cup
of
tea
but
that
someone
aint
me
overall
a
solid
pilsner
offering
great
to
see
a
nice
refreshing
well
done
lager
so
easily
found
great
for
a
barbeque
or
post
run
in
the
summer
i
guess
actual
hardest
part
for
me
to
love
this
beer
is
the
worst
i
am
still
a
can
hater
i
know
the
pros
and
cons
but
hell
i
dont
drink
any
beer
out
of
a
can
somebody
help
me
get
over
this
oexcellent
pilsener
easy
drinking
and
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
to
quench
the
thirst
a
good
hoppy
american
lager
i
dont
get
much
german
from
this
at
all
maybe
a
little
dusty
yellow
grain
base
but
this
beer
is
one
heck
of
a
hoppy
lager
more
so
than
any
from
europe
i
have
seen
nice
snow
white
head
good
clarity
and
a
powerful
hoppy
aroma
of
some
bigger
american
hops
maybe
simcoe
or
something
similar
centennial
or
the
like
i
wouldnt
quite
call
it
an
india
pale
lager
but
its
getting
there
stylistically
with
all
the
hops
for
me
at
least
it
is
big
hop
flavors
pick
up
about
mid
palate
where
the
hefty
pilsener
malt
base
leaves
off
its
never
too
biter
but
has
a
resinous
dank
hoppy
dominance
to
it
a
little
filling
fuller
bodied
for
the
style
and
i
didnt
find
it
to
be
as
crisp
per
se
as
advertised
but
i
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
an
easier
drinking
summer
hoppy
brew
than
and
ipa
but
this
will
likely
not
please
those
in
search
of
an
authentic
german
pils
pours
a
cloudy
and
light
gold
color
with
lots
of
head
that
dies
quick
with
lace
patches
around
glass
beer
is
light
smooth
the
minor
citric
hoppy
crispness
is
dominant
but
there
is
a
little
big
of
sweetness
coming
off
as
well
thanks
to
a
good
balance
finishes
dry
and
crisp
and
is
a
simple
and
enjoyable
beer
ive
never
had
anything
like
it
the
hops
are
up
front
and
familiar
for
someone
who
drinks
more
hoppy
beers
than
anything
else
but
the
combination
of
the
hops
and
super
light
lager
mouthfeel
and
appearance
make
this
one
pretty
unique
i
gave
this
to
my
dad
and
a
friend
who
drinks
more
steel
reserve
than
craft
and
they
both
really
enjoyed
it
i
think
this
is
a
great
gateway
beer
for
those
who
are
used
to
aals
and
the
like
light
while
having
no
shortage
of
flavor
im
pretty
much
blown
away
this
is
definitely
my
favorite
beer
ive
had
from
sixpoint
im
disappointed
that
it
took
me
so
long
to
try
this
awesome
stuff
highly
recommended
o
a
decent
pilsner
but
compares
poorly
to
the
snfirestone
walker
beer
camp
torpedo
pilsner
that
preceded
it
nice
enough
but
could
be
crisper
for
something
called
the
crisp
overall
absolutely
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
and
likely
to
please
the
ipa
fans
who
are
normally
wary
of
malty
lagers
or
pilsners
but
if
im
missing
the
good
bread
malt
balancing
notes
and
if
im
going
to
dock
points
for
a
lack
of
clarity
i
also
have
to
give
the
crisp
full
points
for
being
fantastic
at
what
it
wants
to
be
a
superhoppy
pilsener
with
american
hop
flavors
i
get
why
people
love
this
brew
and
its
one
ill
likely
revisit
kind
of
new
to
this
style
but
i
really
like
this
one
works
great
in
these
hot
humid
summer
days
a
lot
of
flavor
packed
in
to
this
beer
but
maintains
a
light
refreshing
body
well
done
once
again
by
the
boys
from
sixpoint
seek
this
one
out
beer
has
a
typical
pilsner
head
beer
has
a
wonderful
aroma
of
hops
strange
because
they
actually
smell
more
like
american
ipa
hops
vs
the
usual
european
noble
variety
the
taste
is
excellent
for
a
pilsner
very
hop
forward
with
maltiness
balance
a
little
over
hopped
perhaps
but
a
tad
more
balanced
than
say
prima
overall
i
thought
this
was
one
of
the
better
pilsners
out
there
and
a
high
quality
brew
from
sixpoint
nice
high
carbonation
o
a
nice
lager
that
is
more
or
less
in
the
german
style
the
body
is
a
little
too
slight
and
not
quite
dry
enough
for
me
to
fully
accept
this
beer
as
an
authentic
germanstyle
pils
yet
it
is
still
very
good
sixpoint
the
crisp
45
this
is
another
quite
delicious
beer
from
sixpoint
its
close
but
not
quite
to
a
traditional
german
pilsner
overall
the
perfect
american
pilsner
overall
a
darn
good
lager
just
very
well
done
poured
into
a
standard
pint
glass
crystal
clear
light
gold
color
with
fine
streaming
bubbles
flowing
from
the
bottom
large
initial
head
though
it
fades
somewhat
quickly
the
nose
features
plenty
of
hop
aromavery
nice
though
more
american
than
german
with
grassy
piney
notes
oh
this
is
a
fine
hoppy
pils
with
lots
of
bitterness
and
grassy
hop
flavors
malt
is
light
but
holds
up
reasonably
well
light
clean
finish
nice
spritzy
carbonation
level
one
of
the
best
pils
ive
had
in
a
while
the
taste
echoes
the
aroma
with
the
same
sweet
grainy
malty
characteristics
that
leave
a
dry
but
clean
hop
bite
at
the
end
often
i
rate
a
beer
on
whether
i
would
remember
it
a
year
from
now
if
someone
asked
me
about
it
i
think
i
could
give
a
future
customer
a
pretty
good
description
of
what
to
expect
served
in
a
tall
spiegelau
pilsnerkölsch
crystal
it
was
a
good
pilsner
and
definitely
one
of
the
better
ones
i
have
had
would
definitely
drink
this
again
make
better
versions
of
domestic
styles
i
poured
this
beer
into
a
glass
it
has
a
murkey
orange
color
body
with
a
small
fizzy
head
the
armoma
had
a
citrus
lemon
aroma
to
it
the
taste
has
a
crisp
pilsner
flavor
hop
and
citrus
malt
the
hops
also
gives
it
a
earthy
grassy
flavor
also
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
and
overall
a
good
pilsner
o
the
more
i
sample
from
sixpoint
the
more
i
start
to
get
them
maybe
its
the
way
they
hold
up
a
middle
finger
to
style
conventions
this
is
some
weird
hybrid
between
a
german
pils
a
kellerbier
and
a
good
ol
fashioned
hoppy
murican
lager
even
better
it
actually
works
i
dont
know
all
i
know
is
i
would
definitely
buy
this
again
a
decent
pilsener
not
a
bad
offering
from
sixpoint
although
it
wasnt
in
the
same
league
as
their
bengali
tiger
nice
crisp
living
up
to
the
name
at
least
but
there
are
better
pilseners
out
there
overall
this
is
seems
to
be
close
to
a
kellerbier
in
presentation
with
a
heavy
bitter
pils
take
as
it
warms
up
the
flavors
come
through
pleasantly
but
the
nose
seems
off
and
mouthfeel
a
bit
overdone
a
disappointing
beer
the
aroma
and
appearance
are
great
but
the
presence
of
acetaldehyde
in
large
quantities
seriously
lowers
the
palatability
of
this
beer
up
there
with
the
best
love
this
brewer
can
duckfat
this
one
pours
a
hazy
darker
golden
color
there
was
a
somewhat
frothy
offwhite
head
on
it
it
didnt
linger
long
or
leave
much
lacing
the
nose
is
ok
but
a
bit
bland
faint
earthy
hops
and
some
malts
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
nose
bit
of
bitterness
some
malts
very
smooth
o
this
is
excellent
happy
to
have
something
this
good
domestic
worth
seeking
out
oan
above
average
pils
good
for
a
hot
day
o
best
pilsener
ever
sixpoint
crushes
everything
they
touch
and
this
beer
is
no
different
definitely
give
it
a
shot
if
ur
skeptical
about
american
takes
on
german
pilseners
u
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
a
competent
attempt
at
a
pilsner
by
sixpoint
o
great
fuckin
pils
been
way
too
long
since
i
had
one
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
sixteen
ounce
aluminum
can
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
had
on
tap
at
five
horses
in
davis
square
humid
day
and
it
seemed
perfect
for
a
crisp
pilsner
very
clean
taste
right
away
classic
german
notes
very
surprising
very
lemongrass
and
wheat
smell
with
little
head
not
overly
carbonated
but
the
beer
kept
its
crispness
throughout
very
refreshing
beer
nice
change
from
overly
hopped
regulars
always
served
very
good
beer
notes
perhaps
the
best
german
styled
pilsner
i
have
ever
had
refreshing
tasty
delightful
ill
be
back
for
more
o
there
is
not
much
hop
flavor
in
this
beer
and
there
is
no
malt
flavor
to
be
found
at
all
it
is
very
clean
and
crisp
just
a
bit
boring
i
am
really
pleased
with
this
beer
this
is
not
really
my
goto
style
i
think
mainly
because
it
often
reminds
me
of
beers
i
drank
before
discovering
the
diverse
offerings
of
the
craft
world
sixpoint
has
taken
the
style
that
is
typically
a
staple
of
college
frat
parties
and
daydrinking
cookouts
and
turned
it
into
exactly
what
we
all
want
it
to
be
drinkable
refreshing
and
simple
but
also
flavorful
and
thoroughly
enjoyable
really
delivers
on
the
palate
in
a
big
way
for
the
style
nicely
done
light
crisp
pilsner
taste
and
feel
with
a
bend
towards
lemon
zest
or
lemongrass
malty
cereal
grains
hold
the
backbone
but
the
light
lemon
fruit
keeps
the
taste
and
feel
properly
refreshing
nice
summer
quencher
that
accompanies
smoked
pork
or
beef
very
well
overall
this
is
a
really
solid
german
pilsener
that
nails
the
style
perfectly
if
you
happen
to
be
looking
for
a
flavorful
summertime
beer
this
one
could
definitely
fit
the
bill
final
thoughts
my
first
ever
sixpoint
beer
and
definitely
lived
up
to
my
expectation
nice
and
flavorful
would
i
drink
it
again
yes
slightly
hazy
and
golden
with
a
fair
head
and
no
lace
powerful
yeasty
and
grainy
aroma
big
bodied
for
a
pilsener
slight
amount
of
spicy
hops
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
but
this
might
be
an
age
issue
beer
i
had
was
a
few
months
old
as
i
recall
more
in
previous
encounters
holds
its
ground
with
the
better
german
pilseners
nice
acidity
and
lively
carbonation
mouthfeel
another
solid
offering
from
sixpoint
not
as
superb
as
3beans
or
resin
but
a
pretty
good
pils
all
the
same
great
mouthfeel
looks
excellent
in
your
glass
could
use
maybe
just
a
tad
more
carbonation
to
give
it
more
oomph
but
refreshing
and
fine
for
these
lazy
hazy
days
of
summer
could
drink
this
often
give
it
a
try
very
good
beer
recommended
o
a
full
flavored
clean
hoppy
pilsner
that
doesnt
get
fatiguing
a
great
choice
for
a
german
pilz
in
the
us
pours
straw
gold
with
perfect
clarity
champagne
effervescence
and
exceptional
brilliance
a
creamy
two
finger
white
head
that
fell
fast
but
left
gorgeous
lace
a
ring
and
cap
nose
is
outrageous
simplicity
outstanding
malt
spicy
hops
yeast
and
a
touch
of
lemon
subtly
floral
clean
the
malt
is
deep
and
strong
but
not
sweet
bread
and
grain
taste
is
is
terrific
crisp
like
the
name
suggests
it
has
a
slight
bitterness
a
bit
of
pucker
from
the
lemon
but
no
sour
or
real
fruitiness
the
malt
is
outstanding
and
playful
it
adds
a
grainy
bite
of
its
own
to
go
alongside
the
hop
bite
and
the
carbonation
and
really
shines
deep
full
but
not
heavy
it
offers
just
a
little
honey
to
keep
it
soft
on
the
palate
and
to
keep
the
palate
interested
finishes
dry
with
some
oil
and
bitter
a
good
lingering
aftertaste
body
is
a
touch
watery
but
smooth
and
slightly
herbal
earthy
and
flavorful
easy
to
drink
uncomplicated
o
though
i
admittedly
dont
prefer
lagers
this
one
leaves
no
lasting
impression
on
me
compared
to
other
more
flavorful
pilsners
ive
had
still
its
easy
to
drink
and
theres
not
anything
necessarily
wrong
with
it
another
disappointment
from
what
i
had
expected
to
be
a
really
great
brewery
based
on
the
buzz
out
there
this
was
a
weaktasting
underpowered
beer
that
left
me
with
a
feeling
of
loss
and
unfulfilled
potential
it
didnt
taste
bad
just
muted
and
diluted
and
it
was
very
fresh
i
liked
the
larger
can
size
i
will
say
for
a
beer
that
youd
want
to
session
that
was
perfect
but
for
me
this
was
not
only
forgettable
but
somewhat
lacking
would
not
buy
again
even
for
outdoor
sunny
sessioning
which
i
had
figured
it
would
be
perfect
for
overall
crisp
as
properly
named
a
nice
canned
pilsner
that
seem
to
have
everything
a
pils
should
and
tastes
good
definitely
would
have
again
pours
a
great
golden
color
smells
like
lemon
grass
wheat
initial
taste
is
one
of
very
little
as
far
as
complex
flavors
but
i
guess
just
what
it
claims
to
be
crisp
mouthfeel
watery
smooth
and
slightly
bitter
not
one
of
my
favorites
and
likely
not
added
to
my
must
have
in
fridge
list
poured
into
a
pint
glass
cloudy
and
gold
with
a
two
inch
foamy
head
smell
is
faint
but
fresh
and
well
crisp
wow
that
is
some
classic
pilsner
hops
hops
is
big
but
not
overboard
with
a
quick
bite
that
seems
a
combination
of
the
hops
and
carbonation
this
is
a
pilsner
with
flavor
yet
without
being
a
bomb
or
seeming
to
much
like
an
ipa
the
bite
gives
it
a
clean
and
crisp
finish
yet
just
the
right
amount
of
hoppy
goodness
lingers
long
on
the
palate
sixpoint
definitely
hit
the
mark
on
this
one
did
they
kidnap
some
munchland
meisterbrauer
this
tastes
the
beers
i
had
in
munich
but
with
volume
turned
up
great
pils
one
more
good
brew
from
sixpoint
o
there
should
to
be
so
many
more
flavorful
lagers
like
this
available
in
the
market
this
beer
is
mostly
straight
forward
noble
hops
with
some
pilsner
malt
and
a
clean
lager
fermentation
overall
my
first
craft
lager
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
very
complex
for
its
type
yet
at
the
same
time
it
stays
true
to
the
formula
and
the
goal
to
quench
and
refresh
cheers
abort
its
a
pretty
good
german
pilsner
would
make
a
good
fishin
beer
i
like
that
its
in
cans
sorry
this
one
was
just
not
for
me
o
i
seldom
reach
for
a
lager
but
this
is
an
exception
the
evident
quality
of
ingredients
and
hoppy
twist
make
this
a
new
favorite
for
this
ipalover
i
will
be
going
back
to
this
again
and
again
dark
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
heavy
haze
poured
with
a
short
rich
rocky
foam
that
quickly
reduced
to
a
thin
wispy
cap
lemony
and
minty
hop
aromas
with
bready
and
biscuity
aromas
beneath
carbonation
creates
a
pleasant
slighty
grainy
medium
bodied
feel
light
lemony
and
minty
hop
flavors
with
biscuity
flavors
beneath
finishes
with
a
crisp
lingering
minty
lemony
hop
bitterness
a
very
easy
drink
and
a
nice
clean
finish
nice
version
of
the
style
cheers
oits
an
okay
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
herbedspiced
lager
than
a
pilsner
maybe
its
just
not
fresh
still
an
easy
and
fun
drinker
though
would
recommend
straight
from
the
16oz
can
so
satisfying
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
clean
bitterness
dry
finish
decent
balance
with
the
hop
and
malt
i
find
it
to
be
a
nice
change
of
pace
between
stouts
this
winter
a
well
done
pilsener
overall
i
appreciate
a
more
american
take
on
an
old
world
style
but
this
attempt
fails
in
my
opinion
the
dryhopping
sounded
like
a
good
idea
but
the
flavors
and
balance
are
all
off
if
i
am
going
for
an
americanized
pale
lager
in
16
oz
tallboy
ill
take
a
new
belgium
shift
any
day
a
different
but
welcome
take
on
the
style
excellent
drinkability
could
be
a
session
beer
or
for
a
slow
enjoyment
slightly
different
from
a
traditional
pilsner
given
the
fruity
and
citrusy
tweak
a
pilsner
with
an
american
twist
in
my
opinion
enhanced
didnt
get
any
offflavor
and
has
less
than
2
months
to
expiration
date
a
spot
on
pilsner
that
brought
me
right
back
to
my
memories
of
being
in
munich
and
prague
excellent
representation
of
the
style
and
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
sixpoint
to
date
highly
recommended
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
a
quality
american
lager
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
pours
a
orangish
straw
color
with
a
white
head
that
all
but
disappears
smells
of
slight
citrus
but
not
much
else
tastes
of
citrus
and
hops
great
taste
beer
goes
down
smooth
for
its
light
body
and
is
perfectly
carbonated
overall
a
slightly
above
average
beer
consumed
on
tap
in
a
standard
pint
glass
pours
a
rich
golden
hue
appears
clear
with
some
white
head
that
fades
some
limited
lacing
but
not
much
smell
and
taste
are
very
much
of
clean
light
malts
a
bit
more
pilsner
than
lager
on
the
taste
the
hops
balances
out
the
malts
nicely
this
one
is
very
easy
drinking
and
could
be
consumed
in
quanity
or
enjoyed
as
a
single
goldenamber
with
a
thin
creamy
head
nice
citric
noble
hop
aroma
with
notes
of
sweet
toasted
malt
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
it
starts
with
a
nice
hop
bite
and
then
becomes
refreshingly
grassy
and
herbal
with
elements
of
citrus
the
malt
is
not
very
prominent
but
does
give
a
nice
balance
to
the
package
very
smooth
and
almost
creamy
in
comparison
to
other
examples
in
the
style
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
this
is
a
lovely
pils
very
clean
and
very
drinkable
it
is
definitely
reminiscent
of
a
german
lager
but
it
has
some
serious
american
influences
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
overall
tasty
and
drinkable
what
more
do
you
need
ill
definitely
look
for
this
again
the
next
time
im
in
new
york
the
crisp
is
crisp
not
very
smooth
the
appearance
is
clear
yellow
with
thin
creamy
white
head
that
is
leaving
a
spotty
lace
the
smell
is
mostly
wet
grain
the
taste
is
sharp
with
saaz
hops
and
tinges
of
alcohol
plus
a
lingering
aftertaste
after
several
swigs
the
beer
smooths
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
in
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
ok
o
another
extremely
wellcrafted
beer
from
sixpoint
im
loving
the
cans
and
im
loving
what
this
brewery
is
doing
16
oz
can
pours
a
medium
amber
with
persistent
fluffy
white
head
truly
a
beauty
of
a
beer
aroma
is
grassy
with
lemon
and
caramel
malt
bitter
pepper
and
grassy
hops
mark
the
flavor
although
a
bit
soapy
crisp
is
a
perfect
description
for
the
mouthfeel
a
nice
hoppy
bite
sharp
to
the
tongue
mellowing
in
the
finish
german
pilseners
were
my
first
quality
beer
love
after
making
a
trip
to
deutchland
and
this
one
is
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
would
think
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
for
both
craft
and
miller
lite
drinkers
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
with
plenty
of
carbonation
this
is
a
good
go
to
pilsner
taste
is
like
the
can
says
crisp
very
very
crisp
carbonation
is
sharp
and
active
sweet
malt
presence
up
front
and
very
clean
a
bit
bready
hops
are
still
subdued
but
there
is
a
light
grassy
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
finishes
very
dry
overall
a
real
solid
lagerpils
its
more
hop
than
i
think
malt
and
i
usually
like
more
balance
and
i
want
everything
and
the
kitchen
sink
but
this
is
a
worthy
drink
o
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
much
better
examples
within
this
style
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
this
perfectly
clear
with
an
equally
flawless
coloring
two
fingers
of
firm
frothy
head
and
good
lacing
delicate
clean
aromas
show
the
art
in
this
one
light
bready
malt
underpins
a
melange
of
hop
notes
with
lemon
and
grass
giving
a
delightful
fruitiness
with
a
spicy
a
faintly
peppered
edge
taste
has
me
teetering
on
the
fence
of
perfect
balance
is
superb
with
a
light
sweet
malt
base
that
pushes
into
lemon
and
grass
firm
bitterness
is
quite
smooth
followed
by
a
gentle
buttery
biscuit
that
lingers
after
the
swallow
a
bit
of
drying
mintiness
a
herbal
hops
as
well
in
the
finish
and
swallow
feel
is
crisp
with
a
softness
on
the
tongue
from
the
mild
but
active
carbonation
deeply
thirst
quenching
and
satisfying
medium
light
weight
is
spot
on
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
as
is
the
overall
character
to
this
beer
a
darn
near
perfect
pilsner
imo
overall
45
the
crisp
might
not
move
the
needle
that
much
amongst
craft
beer
enthusiasts
but
its
a
pretty
special
respectable
beerone
that
gives
craft
lagers
a
good
name
eminently
drinkable
and
refreshing
and
conveniently
packaged
in
16
ounce
tallboy
cans
i
would
go
to
this
if
ever
i
want
a
change
of
pace
from
the
hop
monsters
and
bold
belgian
ales
i
normally
drink
poured
from
a
can
into
a
tumbler
pint
the
beer
is
a
bright
hazed
orangecopper
color
with
a
filmy
sparse
white
coating
on
the
surface
aromas
of
roasted
grains
and
buttery
sweetness
light
and
subtle
flavors
are
buttery
as
well
but
with
a
crisper
feel
at
the
end
with
some
heavy
roasted
qualities
slightly
tangy
with
some
floral
highlights
throughout
also
buttery
and
tangy
aftertaste
leading
to
a
slick
crisp
clean
finish
heavier
than
most
pils
brews
but
tasty
o
nice
summer
beer
o
i
like
how
i
notice
the
blends
of
the
german
and
the
czech
styles
of
pilseners
i
know
its
labeled
as
a
german
but
that
doesnt
bother
me
i
would
have
this
again
overall
this
just
isnt
my
style
of
beer
pilsners
just
do
not
do
it
for
me
in
any
way
shape
or
form
the
flavor
is
sapped
by
the
lager
yeast
and
it
just
tastes
like
lightly
hopped
water
water
is
cheaper
and
better
for
me
so
i
will
stick
to
that
and
look
elsewhere
to
satisfly
my
session
ale
necessities
medium
to
slightly
light
bodied
crisply
carbonated
just
a
super
refreshing
clean
drinker
very
tasty
indeed
o
the
crisp
from
sixpoint
is
a
very
clean
and
drinkable
brew
with
plenty
of
spicy
herbal
hop
characteristics
balanced
out
but
simple
malt
and
lagered
for
a
delicious
and
refreshing
outcome
its
an
exemplary
americanbrewed
german
style
pilsner
another
success
from
sixpoint
the
hops
turn
this
from
another
bland
lager
into
a
flavorful
refreshing
treat
would
get
again
o
nice
crisp
pilsener
that
is
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
pours
a
darker
yellow
with
a
small
frothy
head
that
fades
fast
smell
is
not
very
potent
bready
with
a
slight
hop
presence
as
well
as
yeast
the
taste
is
sweeter
than
expected
with
the
bready
flavor
coming
through
followed
by
a
slight
bitter
but
nice
hop
flavor
the
beer
finishes
with
a
more
classic
lager
feel
light
mouthfeel
and
the
hops
coming
on
a
bit
stronger
in
the
aftertaste
overall
a
nice
beer
the
flavors
are
great
and
not
overpower
a
nice
beer
for
the
summer
notes
dam
this
german
pilsner
is
tasty
in
other
words
its
freaking
remarkable
the
dry
finish
is
incredibly
spot
on
oh
yeah
and
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
mention
its
a
lager
oh
hell
yeah
cheers
m
light
and
refreshing
carbonation
seemed
a
little
low
to
me
the
palate
opens
with
a
moderate
bitterness
with
flavors
of
lemon
peel
really
green
grass
and
dusty
earth
very
snappy
imo
the
malt
profile
is
a
blend
of
pils
honey
and
a
little
bit
of
caramellike
malts
the
pilsner
malt
does
taste
a
little
raw
lending
a
mild
doughy
flavor
however
the
sweetness
is
a
little
bit
on
the
high
side
and
the
solution
isnt
to
amp
up
the
hops
which
are
already
a
little
too
high
for
the
style
but
still
does
work
with
flavors
of
mild
honey
and
a
lingering
bitterness
lemon
peel
earth
on
the
finish
this
light
bodied
beer
is
pretty
clean
i
cant
pick
out
any
sulfur
and
enjoyable
the
midpalate
is
faintly
watery
but
it
isnt
too
much
of
a
distraction
light
in
body
moderately
resiny
and
with
a
mediumhigh
level
of
carbonation
this
feels
good
on
the
palate
in
some
ways
it
seems
like
the
higher
hopping
level
was
chosen
to
add
a
snappy
resiny
feel
to
offset
the
relatively
soft
water
and
it
does
strike
me
as
a
bold
and
distinguishing
step
nicely
done
this
is
possibly
the
most
enjoyable
sixpoint
beer
ive
had
o
i
love
the
fact
that
the
lager
yeast
takes
a
back
seat
in
the
flavor
department
allowing
the
real
flavors
of
the
beer
to
come
through
crisp
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
o
this
is
really
an
outstanding
fresh
flavorful
refreshing
and
like
the
name
implies
a
crisp
pilsner
a
great
hot
weather
drinker
the
body
light
but
almost
medium
is
extremely
refreshing
balancing
a
constant
crispness
with
a
likewise
constant
smoothness
that
makes
for
easy
sipping
and
refreshment
while
a
very
nice
beer
all
around
the
feel
is
perhaps
its
best
aspect
16oz
can
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
holds
decent
retention
and
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
fresh
with
pilsner
malt
grass
yup
crisp
tastes
are
well
crisp
pilsner
malt
grassy
sharp
hop
bite
on
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
thintomedium
but
sharp
crisp
and
clean
on
the
slightly
drying
finish
i
had
this
one
last
week
but
didnt
give
it
a
full
review
then
picked
up
another
one
yesterday
when
i
thought
i
missed
something
when
i
saw
the
high
scores
it
has
received
i
still
think
its
good
not
great
just
a
plain
good
pilsner
with
tons
of
flavor
and
perfectly
clean
this
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
musty
pilsner
aroma
its
not
a
heavy
grassy
saaz
hop
assault
but
they
are
definitely
there
some
hoppiness
on
the
flavor
as
this
beer
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
was
it
good
yes
did
i
enjoy
it
definitely
but
i
wasnt
as
enthusiastic
about
it
as
some
other
craft
pilsners
ive
had
recently
from
the
central
texas
area
still
glad
to
see
this
and
id
definitely
drink
it
again
if
given
half
a
chance
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
color
is
crystal
clear
yellowgolden
with
great
carbonation
the
best
on
date
was
a
week
ago
but
this
was
still
a
good
experience
smells
like
cheap
beer
but
in
a
good
way
the
taste
was
sweet
like
straw
buttery
i
do
not
normally
drink
pilsners
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
ill
have
another
pretty
darn
drinkable
nice
pils
would
take
this
over
many
german
pils
i
tried
over
there
0104
lightly
toasted
malt
sweetness
upfront
then
the
lemon
and
grass
hoppiness
takes
over
bitter
and
a
little
tinny
to
the
finish
crisp
bright
metallic
palate
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
almost
energizing
a
pretty
good
pilsner
this
really
isnt
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
it
is
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
so
i
would
drink
this
again
be
that
as
it
may
i
feel
this
is
a
bit
overpriced
considering
what
it
is
id
almost
be
just
as
happy
with
a
sixpack
of
pbr
or
urquell
tastefaintly
grassy
pilsner
malt
subtle
citrus
nice
bite
from
generous
amounts
of
german
hops
indeed
leading
to
a
very
crisp
finish
tasty
and
sessionable
a
fine
match
for
a
plate
of
loaded
nachos
cheers
poured
out
a
lightly
hazed
pale
straw
color
with
a
fizzled
collar
for
a
head
and
only
minimal
lacing
aroma
is
very
florally
hopped
over
the
top
of
a
biscuity
cracker
malt
and
at
times
the
flavor
reminded
me
of
chamomile
tea
with
a
side
of
honeyed
buns
for
breakfast
yet
the
hops
retain
a
spicy
character
through
and
through
body
is
light
and
just
as
crisp
as
the
the
name
promised
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pils
in
a
can
o
this
is
a
really
enjoyable
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
beer
this
is
definitely
sessionable
and
a
very
well
balanced
beer
with
respect
to
flavor
i
have
had
this
one
many
times
and
will
likely
have
many
in
the
future
as
well
drinkability
easy
drinking
nicely
hopped
lager
its
got
enough
of
a
hop
bite
to
keep
me
interested
yet
still
remains
crisp
and
clean
i
really
enjoyed
all
4
cans
and
will
get
more
of
this
when
i
can
thanks
adam
o
this
is
an
interesting
beer
that
has
a
nice
refreshing
sweet
lemony
taste
but
its
got
an
american
craft
beer
feel
to
it
kind
of
like
a
brooklyn
bitburger
or
something
this
pilsner
is
not
for
the
purist
but
it
quite
enjoyable
and
refreshing
just
the
same
i
would
not
describe
it
as
crisp
as
there
is
a
somewhat
heavy
sweetness
present
o
this
is
the
best
pilsner
i
have
ever
had
hands
down
flavor
is
similar
with
grassy
hop
bitterness
and
light
crackery
pils
malt
and
a
bitter
crispness
that
certainly
lives
up
to
its
name
light
and
easy
drinking
with
plenty
of
hop
character
unique
and
flavorful
in
the
vein
of
prima
pils
maybe
slightly
more
balanced
and
less
bitter
definitely
traditional
though
and
plenty
drinkable
overall
drinkability
a
very
good
and
flavorful
pilsner
quite
drinkable
and
well
done
overall
things
nicely
in
balance
and
yet
forward
in
flavor
rather
than
going
too
smooth
and
mild
i
think
my
only
disappointment
is
the
aroma
which
is
quite
mild
and
only
gets
a
tad
better
as
the
beer
warms
up
otherwise
definitely
worth
the
4pack
i
purchased
so
i
enjoy
it
a
few
more
times
another
treat
from
dino
thanks
man
a
style
i
wouldnt
normally
turn
to
but
thats
ok
poured
to
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
crystal
clear
straw
with
a
nice
1
5
finger
white
head
good
retention
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
as
the
name
suggests
crisp
clean
a
hint
of
earthy
hops
accompany
the
pilsner
malts
makes
for
a
very
inviting
beer
the
flavor
is
very
much
the
same
very
approachable
lighter
bodied
and
very
refreshing
with
a
clean
sharp
flavor
not
too
much
its
really
good
overall
this
was
a
treat
not
bad
i
may
get
this
again
in
the
future
given
the
right
circumstances
o
i
really
like
this
beer
if
i
cant
get
prima
pils
in
ky
and
i
cant
then
i
will
happily
settle
for
the
crisp
this
is
going
to
be
a
summer
staple
for
the
pool
and
yard
excellent
beer
worth
seeking
out
if
you
like
a
good
pils
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grass
and
bready
pilsner
malt
as
expected
the
flavor
is
very
clean
and
crisp
i
get
a
lot
of
malt
with
some
grass
and
a
lot
amount
of
bitterness
easy
to
drink
and
quite
refreshing
thin
to
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
not
as
carbonated
as
i
feel
a
pilsener
should
be
sweet
grain
malt
bill
some
tart
flavor
herbal
and
earthy
hops
finish
some
lemon
peel
on
the
heavier
side
of
medium
body
clean
finish
some
lingering
grainy
sweetness
on
the
front
of
the
tongue
clean
sweet
and
smooth
i
really
think
something
called
the
crisp
should
be
a
lot
crisper
though
d
pretty
easy
to
drink
i
had
no
problem
finishing
the
entire
16oz
can
while
watching
a
tv
show
i
enjoyed
this
significantly
more
than
resin
but
i
prefer
metropolitan
flywheel
which
is
available
to
me
locally
the
appearance
is
approriate
for
the
style
as
it
warms
this
gets
bettetr
as
you
would
expect
for
the
style
i
have
tried
5
sixpoint
beers
and
they
all
have
been
outstanding
beers
that
i
intend
to
buy
again
overall
very
smooth
easy
to
drink
balanced
very
flavorful
about
as
good
as
you
can
get
for
the
simple
style
balance
is
what
makes
this
beer
so
great
recommended
for
sure
o
i
cant
believe
how
big
the
smell
is
and
how
small
the
taste
is
i
could
literally
drink
this
until
i
couldnt
move
any
longer
just
so
smooth
tasty
and
smells
great
absolutely
recommend
you
try
this
on
tap
pours
a
semitranslucent
dark
amber
with
an
inch
of
head
tons
of
lacing
aromas
of
citrus
grass
malts
and
a
bit
sour
taste
is
a
nice
sweet
maltiness
with
some
citrus
hops
flavors
of
grains
and
cereal
almost
a
cookie
aftertaste
creamy
mouthfeel
this
sure
does
taste
like
a
hopped
up
pils
overall
a
pilsener
worth
trying
although
the
crisp
shows
a
lot
of
finesse
many
of
the
minor
nuances
may
go
largely
unnoticed
to
novice
drinkers
of
those
of
us
who
are
not
in
analysis
mode
i
would
prefer
to
see
a
more
assertive
balance
toward
hops
while
keeping
the
stern
malt
profile
constant
perhaps
i
just
prefer
drier
and
hoppier
german
lagers
but
this
is
no
slouch
as
it
reels
closer
to
dortmunder
exports
at
least
in
malt
profile
pours
nice
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
offwhite
head
some
nice
grainy
malty
notes
and
slightly
sweet
goes
down
smooth
but
some
nice
grassy
hops
throughout
each
sip
the
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
with
the
persistent
carbonation
and
it
ends
on
a
slightly
sweet
note
i
was
surprised
that
beer
advocate
classified
this
as
a
german
pilsner
it
reminds
me
more
of
a
helles
maybe
because
of
its
soft
sweet
roundness
my
palate
loves
the
north
german
pils
prima
pils
and
jever
overall
it
is
a
good
lager
though
o
this
is
a
perfect
anytime
beer
had
it
last
summer
and
it
was
great
in
the
can
poured
this
one
in
a
glass
and
its
march
still
perfect
drinkability
and
overall
impression
i
thought
this
a
quite
drinkable
pils
and
one
ill
be
happy
to
have
again
that
said
when
given
a
choice
id
opt
for
either
prima
pils
from
victory
as
a
north
german
style
pils
or
the
stoudts
pils
as
a
more
south
german
style
both
are
a
bit
more
crisp
that
this
my
overall
impression
of
the
beer
is
that
this
is
a
good
one
and
while
not
my
favorite
sixpoint
beer
one
that
is
well
made
and
enjoyable
it
would
be
especially
nice
to
have
at
a
dinner
that
features
good
food
and
good
conversation
with
friends
overall
truth
in
advertising
this
is
a
nice
and
crisp
lager
i
could
have
several
of
these
especially
in
the
summer
nothing
mid
blowing
like
some
other
sixpoint
brews
but
solid
excellently
made
lager
fantastic
lager
o
really
nice
to
see
a
craft
lager
with
a
punch
of
hops
i
always
love
when
i
run
into
one
of
those
in
the
fast
paced
craft
beer
movement
lagers
have
been
trying
to
catch
up
crisp
is
proof
that
things
are
turning
around
and
gives
a
better
view
of
what
a
modern
lager
can
be
taking
from
old
while
brewing
from
new
minds
im
assuming
because
this
is
out
of
date
its
no
good
but
i
dont
think
fresh
my
scores
would
improve
much
this
beer
just
arrived
in
indiana
last
week
it
pours
a
light
bodied
honey
gold
in
color
with
a
one
finger
head
the
nose
is
essentially
smooth
and
mellow
pale
malts
with
a
touch
of
honey
the
flavors
are
mild
and
dry
you
get
plenty
of
pale
malts
with
a
touch
of
honey
and
it
finishes
dry
with
moderate
bitterness
the
level
of
bitterness
is
surprising
and
more
than
i
anticipated
the
more
i
sip
it
the
more
floral
components
i
get
yet
not
in
a
hoppy
manner
the
hop
presence
is
minimal
this
beer
drinks
light
in
body
with
a
dry
finish
the
dryness
and
bitterness
keep
me
from
really
endorsing
it
but
its
a
decent
pils
in
a
can
medium
body
and
carbonation
would
be
great
in
a
pale
ale
or
any
number
of
other
styles
but
not
in
a
german
pils
its
too
creamy
and
frankly
not
crisp
enough
in
fact
its
nowhere
near
its
namesake
i
was
disappointed
by
this
especially
after
hearing
many
good
things
about
sixpoint
i
will
gladly
give
them
another
shot
though
o
a
good
pilsner
i
quite
like
this
beer
and
will
be
tempted
by
it
on
tap
but
its
not
worth
the
price
for
4
pack
it
is
not
however
among
my
favorite
american
pilsners
prima
sly
fox
stoudts
holy
city
overall
a
great
pils
clean
crisp
and
full
flavored
youre
not
going
to
get
much
more
flavor
in
a
5
4
beer
delicious
d
these
are
very
very
crushable
well
balanced
flavors
make
that
possible
tasty
brew
technically
classified
as
german
pilsener
on
here
even
though
its
a
mix
i
get
more
of
the
bohemian
side
out
of
it
as
its
got
more
bready
character
is
less
clean
with
less
hops
gut
but
sehr
gut
would
lean
more
toward
the
german
pils
side
poured
out
as
a
nice
golden
color
the
head
was
creamy
and
white
in
color
the
head
settles
and
just
leaves
a
thin
retention
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
a
loaded
with
some
noble
hops
its
got
the
pilsnerlager
aromas
as
well
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
pretty
solid
good
amount
of
bitter
hops
in
there
along
with
a
malt
bill
that
leaves
your
taste
buds
tingling
the
mouthfeel
of
the
beer
was
light
and
soft
it
leaves
a
sharp
tingle
on
the
tongue
that
i
liked
a
lot
overall
its
a
pretty
damn
good
brew
honestly
i
was
impressed
medium
bodied
but
fuller
than
expected
with
a
good
balance
of
earthy
notes
pale
malts
and
crisp
earthy
hops
slight
dry
bitterness
up
front
with
a
spicy
pine
hop
presence
that
is
nicely
balanced
by
pale
biscuity
pilsner
malt
grass
straw
and
light
fruit
well
balanced
and
sessionable
but
kind
of
standard
for
the
style
i
really
wish
this
were
available
around
here
for
a
hot
summer
day
im
not
a
big
pilsner
guy
but
this
one
would
hit
the
spot
in
june
vs
this
cold
january
afternoon
a
marvelous
crisp
lager
in
a
can
i
think
ill
spring
for
a
4
pack
next
time
instead
of
singles
im
not
sure
if
i
would
consider
this
to
be
a
german
pilsner
but
its
deff
a
great
brew
unique
and
full
of
flavor
o
this
beer
really
threw
me
for
a
loop
i
have
not
idea
whether
this
beer
was
designed
to
come
out
like
this
or
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
can
ill
more
than
likely
get
another
single
of
this
just
to
make
sure
i
didnt
get
a
bad
can
if
it
turns
out
differentbetter
ill
definitely
rereview
cheers
o
pretty
good
pilsner
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
overall
this
again
is
a
sixpoint
brew
that
i
would
love
to
try
again
disappointed
after
the
amazing
experience
of
the
righteous
rye
this
is
just
lousy
enough
so
that
i
have
no
interest
in
finishing
the
last
twelves
ounces
sadness
is
a
wasted
beer
not
bad
doesnt
have
that
malt
presence
that
is
in
great
german
pils
or
even
something
like
prima
pils
o
the
most
hop
presence
i
have
ever
had
in
a
pilsner
very
drinkable
and
bitter
it
was
almost
like
a
pale
ale
i
wish
they
all
were
like
this
for
you
pilsner
fans
out
there
this
beer
is
killer
and
i
definitely
recommend
it
o
a
really
nice
pilsner
stacks
up
well
with
oskar
blues
mamas
little
yella
pils
as
one
of
my
favorite
americanmade
pilsners
glad
i
gave
this
a
second
chance
nice
job
sixpoint
the
crisp
would
make
a
sublime
urban
poolside
summer
beer
transparent
orange
in
body
with
petite
white
head
that
leaves
a
mist
on
to
the
brim
of
my
pint
glass
aroma
of
citrus
notes
light
grass
lemon
zest
and
floral
notes
flavors
of
herbal
hops
pine
light
citrus
floral
notes
booze
note
as
the
drink
warms
and
a
slight
hop
spiciness
as
well
light
in
body
with
light
carbonation
a
spicy
herbal
pilsener
that
can
be
enjoyed
straight
from
the
can
redneckstyle
for
the
reserved
craft
beer
yankee
the
crisp
is
the
poet
laureate
of
the
beer
world
it
has
a
sweet
clean
honeyed
maltiness
a
heathery
lemony
hoppiness
that
is
like
a
soft
voice
whispering
in
your
ear
and
a
gratifying
finish
that
is
not
cut
but
patiently
untied
it
pays
homage
to
the
old
world
but
still
toes
the
official
line
that
american
craft
beer
must
be
bolder
and
juicier
d
drinks
nicely
id
call
this
a
staple
along
with
joes
american
pilsner
its
one
of
the
best
ones
that
ive
had
its
just
what
dinner
called
for
this
was
an
ok
quaff
but
seemed
to
play
a
little
too
loosey
goosey
in
the
flavor
and
feel
department
for
a
pilsener
this
could
be
tightened
up
a
good
bit
in
spots
o
a
unique
americanflavored
german
pils
with
a
lot
of
maltiness
but
a
bit
too
much
sweetness
for
me
still
a
very
nice
brew
light
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
isnt
anything
special
but
i
dont
hate
it
i
could
see
myself
getting
this
again
on
the
right
occasion
its
sure
easy
to
drink
d
very
likable
beer
with
delicate
pilsner
flavors
not
too
malty
not
too
floral
no
bitter
bite
at
end
but
just
hoppy
and
tangy
enough
to
maintain
balance
similar
to
a
belgian
golden
pale
without
the
belgian
yeast
and
ripe
fruit
flavors
very
drinkable
hv
cheers
do
first
sixpoint
beer
i
thought
it
was
good
for
what
it
was
the
weird
citrus
thing
going
on
at
the
end
of
each
sip
wonder
if
it
could
be
remedied
by
a
fresher
can
i
shall
find
out
someday
if
so
id
like
to
put
down
quite
a
few
of
these
thanks
mcb4538
nice
crisp
refreshing
beer
enjoyed
it
a
lot
and
i
still
have
another
4
pack
to
drink
m
a
good
beer
sweet
malts
and
enough
hops
to
leave
a
mark
i
really
warmed
up
to
this
one
after
a
few
servings
a
nice
beer
to
bring
hiking
and
make
a
fine
treat
on
the
summit
o
didnt
care
for
this
a
shame
because
sixpoint
comes
so
highly
recommended
i
dont
drink
pilsners
that
often
and
this
isnt
helping
the
cause
would
be
a
great
beer
for
someone
just
getting
into
craft
beer
o
a
nice
pilsener
perfect
amount
of
hops
used
worth
buying
overall
it
was
good
and
enjoyable
but
ill
need
to
try
this
again
as
there
seemed
to
be
something
just
a
tad
different
dont
want
to
say
off
about
the
taste
so
i
need
to
give
it
another
chance
sixpoint
marches
to
the
beat
of
their
own
drum
and
this
offering
is
no
different
not
quite
to
style
but
a
good
beer
nonetheless
o
the
complexity
balanced
with
light
body
make
this
a
very
interesting
and
tasty
beer
the
balance
of
flavors
and
fruit
esters
arent
terribly
clean
for
a
pilsner
so
that
loses
points
but
this
is
well
worth
recommending
to
anyone
looking
for
a
lighterbodied
yet
far
from
bland
beer
o
nothing
special
for
me
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
it
but
it
didnt
do
it
for
me
sensational
must
try
o
overall
bittering
but
the
grain
base
and
hop
palate
seems
to
fall
south
of
expectations
of
german
standard
pilsners
drinks
better
as
a
pale
lager
in
my
opinion
not
ideally
what
i
envision
when
grabbing
for
a
german
style
pilsner
a
bit
outside
the
box
but
maintains
a
decent
enough
flavor
to
warrant
purchase
as
long
as
you
are
not
as
concerned
about
the
style
as
the
flavor
or
enjoyment
drinks
a
bit
big
style
not
your
typical
light
summer
time
affair
too
hopped
maybe
doesnt
much
matter
to
me
the
crisp
is
really
good
one
way
or
another
i
would
drink
it
regularly
if
i
could
hazy
blonde
with
a
thin
white
head
of
different
sized
bubbles
the
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
touch
of
lemony
citrus
untoasted
grain
and
plenty
of
funky
herbal
hops
this
beer
is
unlike
any
german
pils
ive
encountered
but
i
like
it
lightly
creamy
and
effervescent
with
a
hop
oily
finish
good
stuff
albeit
a
little
weird
tasting
in
a
good
way
recommended
o
nicely
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hop
bills
theres
some
huge
flavors
in
this
for
a
pilsner
the
dry
hopping
is
very
apparent
in
the
finish
very
light
easy
drinking
refreshing
and
sessionable
a
very
satisfying
lager
overall
overall
a
damn
good
pilsner
in
my
opinion
such
a
wonderful
change
of
pace
from
what
i
have
been
drinking
things
like
big
stouts
imperial
porters
dipas
and
stuff
like
that
would
i
session
a
number
of
these
cans
probably
not
but
this
is
a
darn
good
pils
especially
for
what
the
weather
is
here
right
now
hot
as
hell
with
some
humidity
to
boot
id
say
this
one
is
certainly
worth
a
try
thanks
trxxpaxxs
also
as
a
side
note
i
just
have
to
say
i
love
that
these
come
in
16oz
cans
thats
probably
my
favorite
container
type
out
there
currently
great
beer
best
served
outdoors
in
the
sun
pours
a
clear
yellow
and
orange
color
and
grows
a
massive
threefinger
head
that
is
pillowy
eggshell
white
and
fluffy
it
hangs
around
for
quite
some
time
and
leaves
generous
patches
of
bubbles
on
the
glass
it
smells
of
orange
lemon
watermelon
rind
some
wheat
straw
and
grasses
and
a
touch
of
yeast
some
bread
and
hop
notes
find
their
way
into
it
as
well
tastes
of
citrus
orange
and
lemon
bread
yeast
floral
hops
some
grassstraw
notes
and
finally
a
bit
of
malt
in
the
very
rear
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
on
the
tongue
smooth
going
down
and
clean
on
the
finish
very
refreshing
overall
a
very
good
pilsener
that
is
going
to
get
me
back
into
the
style
o
a
very
drinkable
delicious
beer
with
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
you
interested
mostly
though
its
all
about
the
aftertaste
o
overall
a
really
good
pilsener
from
sixpoint
very
refreshing
and
some
nice
fruit
and
hops
with
the
usual
grains
and
bread
could
definitely
have
a
few
of
these
and
would
want
to
would
have
it
again
it
does
pour
a
nice
gold
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
soapy
and
foamy
aromaa
is
clearly
the
germanczech
type
hops
and
it
is
delivered
in
the
taste
too
i
guess
its
the
drinkability
where
this
beer
suffers
as
i
just
dont
want
more
than
1
i
am
confident
that
these
will
only
get
better
as
sixpoint
is
a
brewery
i
think
quite
highly
of
it
almost
seems
that
these
are
better
than
the
same
beer
off
the
same
4pack
were
a
cpl
weeks
ago
its
still
kinda
ok
tasting
but
its
not
really
good
maybe
a
visit
to
the
brewery
would
reward
me
with
an
amazing
fresh
version
but
this
just
goes
back
and
forth
too
much
between
being
yeah
this
is
pretty
good
and
then
suddenly
going
yuck
72
d
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
out
of
a
pilsener
overallnicely
done
sixpoint
seek
this
out
i
think
beers
like
these
come
down
to
differences
in
reviewing
personally
i
rate
a
beer
very
simplistically
did
i
enjoy
the
beer
or
not
some
other
users
tend
to
rate
a
beer
by
how
truetostyle
said
beer
is
while
this
is
by
no
means
a
pilsner
by
definition
of
style
it
is
still
a
good
beer
i
dont
think
its
very
reasonable
to
slam
a
brewery
just
because
they
made
a
beer
that
wasnt
brewed
exactly
to
a
certain
style
all
that
being
said
i
like
this
stuff
either
they
just
arent
accomplished
brewers
or
were
smokin
some
serious
crack
when
making
this
recipe
o
im
not
typically
a
pils
kinda
guy
but
this
was
a
pretty
darn
good
beer
something
different
than
the
usual
spread
i
enjoy
and
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
a
really
great
pils
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
one
id
be
drinking
a
lot
more
of
this
stuff
if
it
were
around
o
excellent
beer
an
easy
drinker
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
i
ever
expected
from
a
can
of
beer
i
guess
ill
check
to
see
what
else
sixpoint
has
to
offer
mouthfeel
is
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
with
a
name
like
the
crisp
light
body
feel
that
is
a
bit
dry
but
oh
so
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
ive
been
impressed
by
each
of
the
sixpoint
beers
ive
had
so
far
and
the
crisp
is
no
different
its
amazing
a
delicious
beer
like
this
is
the
same
style
the
gave
the
world
bmc
long
live
the
traditional
lagers
o
pretty
much
defines
a
great
american
pilsener
might
be
tied
with
victory
prima
pils
for
that
title
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
spots
of
lace
dot
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
floral
and
herby
with
some
bready
malt
aromas
very
nice
taste
is
of
very
tasty
floral
and
herb
hops
up
front
with
a
malt
backbone
i
am
also
getting
some
citrus
flavors
on
the
aftertaste
like
the
name
implies
this
beer
is
very
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
an
awesome
beer
with
delicious
aromas
and
tastes
probably
the
best
beer
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
16oz
can
served
in
a
spiegelau
pilsener
pours
the
color
of
straw
with
a
semihazy
clarity
and
a
three
inch
dense
bright
white
head
head
eventually
settles
into
a
solid
quarter
inch
cap
thick
bands
of
textured
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
grassy
with
a
trace
of
citrus
zest
and
a
ripe
earthyfloral
character
most
likely
attributable
to
the
hops
taste
consistent
with
nose
however
there
is
also
a
light
bready
quality
that
comes
out
behind
the
citrus
theres
also
faint
spiciness
in
the
flavor
profile
that
adds
a
little
additional
interest
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
but
closer
to
light
with
an
even
refreshing
carbonation
i
was
actually
expecting
more
of
a
semidry
finish
to
this
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
immensely
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
feel
like
theres
a
little
more
happening
here
than
you
would
generally
find
with
the
style
but
im
okay
with
it
a
really
easy
drinking
offering
and
a
nice
bridge
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
in
my
opinion
this
is
how
a
a
german
pilsener
should
be
its
crisp
and
without
flaws
it
is
crisp
refreshing
and
very
balanced
stacks
up
with
any
of
the
great
german
pilseners
out
there
for
those
of
you
who
appreciate
pilsners
this
is
a
great
micro
option
from
a
great
brewery
in
brooklyn
it
goes
great
with
grilled
sausages
and
any
other
type
of
great
german
food
overall
this
is
2nd
best
american
pilsener
ive
had
prima
pils
has
a
much
stronger
hop
presence
and
is
bit
more
crisp
this
is
an
incredibly
solid
brew
in
a
style
i
dont
really
care
for
i
certainly
would
seek
this
out
again
for
the
summer
months
and
for
friends
who
are
used
to
macro
to
me
this
is
a
good
beer
to
others
im
sure
it
is
a
very
good
beer
i
wish
i
had
it
fresh
overall
this
is
a
quality
pilsner
that
is
welcome
in
my
fridge
anytime
definitely
lives
up
to
the
name
o
oh
ill
be
getting
it
again
very
enjoyable
just
can
be
deceiving
from
the
name
it
comes
off
as
a
light
refreshing
lager
and
its
just
not
still
no
let
down
here
from
6pt
so
far
their
stuff
is
spot
on
great
o
excellent
very
drinkable
and
maintains
interest
summer
session
that
rewards
reflection
overall
huge
disappointment
this
does
not
live
up
to
the
name
the
crisp
16
ounce
can
pours
into
a
conical
pils
style
glass
quite
nicely
a
slightly
hazed
golden
color
going
on
with
a
bright
white
head
aroma
has
a
nice
cereal
grain
complexity
lightly
toasted
malts
with
an
herbaceous
grassy
kick
to
it
nice
rounded
sweetness
mild
grassy
herbaceous
bitterness
a
rolling
malt
profile
is
like
fresh
baked
bread
lightly
toasted
with
a
nice
crisp
fruitiness
a
touch
of
sulfur
and
lingering
bittering
hops
with
herbalcitric
flavors
arising
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
a
sturdy
level
of
carbonation
going
on
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
i
could
definitely
get
comforable
sipping
on
this
on
a
warm
fall
or
hot
summer
day
refreshing
quality
makes
it
go
down
way
too
easily
the
crisp
pours
into
the
glass
a
subtle
yellow
color
with
faded
golden
highlights
a
inch
of
burnt
sugar
tinted
foam
on
top
that
vanishes
and
leaves
little
stick
scents
include
pale
malt
a
heaping
of
german
hop
variety
pilsner
malt
etc
taste
comes
on
pretty
strong
which
is
a
good
thing
although
a
bit
too
big
for
a
pils
if
i
were
mashing
styles
i
would
put
this
at
german
ipa
a
lot
of
grassy
earthy
hops
with
a
nice
bready
bite
biscuit
flavor
is
very
large
pilsner
malt
as
well
its
amazing
how
much
taste
this
has
with
such
a
low
abv
feel
is
bitter
and
in
between
light
and
medium
its
carbed
up
well
in
the
1st
12
but
the
second
flattens
it
out
i
enjoyed
the
first
half
but
struggled
through
the
2nd
its
just
too
much
of
a
good
thing
that
being
the
german
influenceingredients
this
screams
usa
interpretation
of
a
style
if
i
opened
a
second
can
right
after
this
i
would
not
be
able
to
get
through
it
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
a
very
nice
bitterness
quite
refreshing
as
the
can
said
there
isnt
much
for
this
beer
to
hide
behind
and
they
did
a
good
job
with
it
overall
id
say
it
was
a
good
solid
pilsner
i
should
point
out
that
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
i
would
have
this
beer
again
if
it
were
available
its
perfect
for
a
warm
summer
night
when
you
dont
want
to
be
assaulted
by
hops
or
drink
some
viscous
stout
o
heavier
than
the
average
pilsner
especially
on
the
first
sip
get
past
that
first
hump
and
your
diligence
will
be
rewarded
by
a
solid
drinker
not
exactly
the
light
refreshing
lawnmover
beer
you
expect
from
a
pils
but
worth
trying
o
would
be
so
much
more
disappointing
if
i
tried
this
outside
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
just
too
heavy
and
not
refreshing
or
crisp
like
a
pilsener
should
be
with
this
name
damn
this
beer
is
officially
not
crisp
overall
so
far
i
am
impressed
with
the
brewery
so
far
wasnt
the
biggest
fan
of
the
cream
but
every
other
offering
seems
to
be
very
drinkable
and
full
of
flavor
its
amazing
how
this
beer
makes
me
question
where
miller
goes
wrong
with
the
typical
pills
even
the
price
is
close
to
a
24oz
miller
lite
and
i
would
prefer
this
one
hands
down
to
anyone
recommended
i
was
a
bit
skeptical
picking
this
beer
up
boy
was
i
wrong
the
can
captures
all
the
flavors
of
the
hops
and
malt
bringing
together
a
really
well
put
together
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
fair
sized
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
will
definitely
give
it
buy
again
pours
a
bright
golden
body
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
behind
plenty
of
lacing
it
smells
very
malty
bready
it
smeels
a
little
grassy
as
well
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
well
balanced
it
has
a
malty
sweetness
at
first
followed
by
a
lingering
hop
bite
that
is
pretty
crisp
like
the
name
would
suggest
a
medium
bodied
beer
with
plenty
of
flavor
makes
this
pilsner
a
great
choice
for
a
session
beer
anytime
of
the
year
ive
had
hundreds
of
new
beers
since
my
last
review
on
this
site
but
this
one
has
inspired
me
to
come
back
and
share
my
thoughts
a
really
enjoyable
pilsner
and
brewed
locally
im
in
brooklyn
now
so
im
filled
with
pride
a
wonderful
beer
all
out
i
must
say
reminds
me
more
of
a
good
czech
then
a
german
must
be
the
bohemian
in
the
wort
looks
the
part
with
a
clear
golden
yellow
body
not
yellow
almost
green
gold
but
yellow
almost
orange
nose
is
a
bit
off
older
can
a
hint
of
banana
a
bit
too
much
for
my
liking
but
nice
nose
of
sweetness
only
a
czech
can
have
floral
pollen
and
hay
palate
is
crisp
indeed
dry
end
but
not
as
aggressive
formally
proper
hint
of
stale
banana
but
otherwise
holds
nicely
will
have
again
as
my
next
itch
for
a
pilsner
goldenrod
color
just
shy
of
completely
transparent
as
there
is
a
tiny
bit
of
haze
airy
head
leaves
a
nice
trail
down
the
side
of
the
glass
aroma
is
bready
spicy
grass
a
hint
of
fruit
taste
is
surprisingly
complex
for
a
pilsner
there
is
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
to
add
depth
to
the
malty
backbone
and
the
saaz
flavor
adds
some
yes
crispness
it
all
cleans
up
in
the
end
for
a
beer
thats
simply
a
pleasure
to
drink
pours
a
mostly
clean
golden
straw
with
decent
cap
of
white
froth
good
retention
little
lacing
scent
is
of
grassy
hops
bready
and
lightly
sweet
malts
and
a
touch
of
lemon
taste
brings
the
components
of
scent
together
nicely
mostly
clean
bready
taste
combines
with
light
grassy
hops
the
sweetness
is
quite
low
and
the
lemon
only
peeks
through
occasionally
near
the
somewhat
bitter
finish
medium
bodied
good
carbonation
but
more
hefty
than
crisp
a
decent
pilsner
quite
clean
overall
pours
a
very
clear
moderate
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
head
and
tons
of
sticky
lacing
as
it
goes
down
thin
cap
throughout
the
nose
brings
some
lightlysweet
grain
and
bread
notes
plus
some
floral
and
herbal
hops
the
flavor
is
a
bit
hoppy
with
mild
sweetness
good
balance
between
grain
and
hops
light
body
and
fairly
crisp
though
a
bit
too
sweet
in
the
finish
pretty
good
though
not
quite
as
good
as
sixpoints
other
brews
o
what
can
i
say
its
a
remarkable
beer
for
a
style
that
is
ubiquitous
and
often
poorly
done
by
the
imitators
the
crisp
really
stands
out
a
bit
sweeter
than
i
am
used
to
from
the
style
but
i
welcome
that
it
is
perfectly
balanced
and
frankly
a
pleasure
to
drink
who
said
lagers
have
to
be
boring
will
be
seeking
this
when
it
hits
dc
overall
definitely
a
great
take
on
the
style
easily
one
of
the
best
offerings
from
sixpoint
at
this
point
a
very
solid
beer
overall
and
almost
crazy
drinkable
overall
very
good
but
i
would
have
enjoyed
more
aromatics
as
it
says
on
the
can
it
was
dryhopped
but
i
know
for
a
pilsener
that
is
not
generally
a
punch
in
the
nose
very
good
taste
and
that
certainly
raises
my
opinion
of
it
i
have
bought
a
lot
of
this
over
the
summer
and
certainly
regret
none
of
it
has
a
wonderfully
malty
pilsner
smell
the
hit
of
honeylike
sweetness
upfront
in
the
taste
is
offputting
the
bitterness
eventually
balances
it
out
extremely
short
finish
cant
get
past
that
initial
sweetness
though
which
seeming
jarringly
out
of
place
in
a
pilsner
might
be
good
outside
on
a
hot
day
though
overall
4
0
this
is
good
real
nice
and
solid
this
is
a
good
pilsner
thats
exactly
what
i
want
a
pilsner
to
be
that
said
its
not
exactly
rocketing
into
my
top
10
but
if
im
looking
for
a
pilsner
you
can
bet
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
good
job
sixpoint
o
this
has
great
drinkability
i
could
put
down
a
4pack
of
this
stuff
easily
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
a
perfect
beer
to
sit
back
and
enjoy
on
a
hot
day
in
the
sun
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
craft
lager
in
a
can
love
it
poured
in
to
a
sa
perfect
pint
glass
the
color
is
hazy
gold
with
a
finger
of
white
heading
on
top
raw
grains
come
through
in
the
nose
though
it
is
very
clean
smelling
flavor
is
a
bit
metallic
with
a
sweet
back
end
mouthfeel
is
indeed
crisp
and
refreshing
as
hell
overall
i
love
this
stuff
o
really
impressed
with
my
first
sixpoint
brew
especially
since
its
a
style
that
isnt
really
up
my
alley
too
bitter
for
style
if
anything
overhopped
maybe
would
just
appreciate
being
able
to
distinguish
the
hops
in
here
d
pretty
drinkable
i
cant
see
sessioning
with
this
one
though
because
of
the
numbing
hopsage
combo
or
whatever
that
is
thats
numbing
my
tongue
so
hard
might
just
be
super
hopped
without
the
sage
solid
beer
nevertheless
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
sweet
on
the
front
sweet
on
the
back
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
overall
it
is
quite
enjoyable
as
a
pilsner
goes
very
drinkable
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
good
finish
i
like
it
id
have
more

good

very

everything
comes

nicely
mouthfeel

is
excellent
talk
about
a
thirst
quencher
overall
a
very
tasty
beer
that
would
definitely
work
very
well
as
a
summer
refresher
it
actually
kind
of
reminded
me
of
a
gingerale
soda
its
worth
seeking
out
and
im
happy
i
have
another
7
cans
in
the
fridge
looking
forward
to
trying
the
other
sixpoint
beers
i
bought
as
well
overall
an
excellent
beer
i
hope
i
can
find
these
for
sale
in
ct
it
was
delicious
overall
decent
and
slightly
tasty
for
a
pilsener
but
i
wish
that
there
was
a
bit
more
going
on
here
o
excellent
beer
very
easy
drinking
wow
overall
another
excellent
brew
by
sixpoint
the
name
is
pretty
descriptive
and
helpful
hazy
orangey
golden
color
with
some
brown
mixed
in
cream
colored
head
which
stuck
around
for
almost
the
entire
beer
some
lacing
smell
was
sweet
and
grainy
flavor
was
malty
at
first
but
finished
up
with
some
dry
hops
sticky
mouth
feel
at
times
but
smooth
overall
sweet
bitter
flavorful
and
fresh
crisp
is
a
perfect
name
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
i
plan
on
seeking
this
one
out
again
happy
to
see
sixpoint
on
the
shelves
o
a
good
pilsner
not
the
prettiest
but
its
nicely
hopped
to
make
it
both
flavorful
and
refreshing
o
a
refreshing
clean
crisp
pilsner
good
for
hot
summer
days
not
bad
but
not
great
a
decent
pils
that
doesnt
really
hit
the
high
notes
but
puts
together
a
solid
package
nonetheless
still
below
my
favourites
of
the
style
o
overall
wanted
to
try
this
but
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
this
beer
however
shone
through
as
fairly
solid
in
my
opinion
it
really
hit
the
spot
o
a
supremely
drinkable
beer
and
yet
another
solid
offering
from
the
brewery
which
is
rapidly
becoming
one
of
my
favorites
okay
this
one
is
hitting
the
spot
like
crazy
this
has
to
be
in
the
top
3
german
pilseners
ive
tried
kudos
to
sixpoint
and
kudos
to
joe
but
wheres
the
reference
to
the
sehrvery
in
german
while
sixpoint
does
many
wonderful
things
with
this
beer
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
a
few
things
out
lager
beer
is
not
traditionally
dryhopped
dry
hopping
is
traditional
in
english
ale
brewing
i
find
that
the
aroma
in
the
crisp
is
too
ale
like
while
the
mouthfeel
and
taste
are
purely
pilsener
like
the
aroma
is
misleading
also
lager
beer
should
be
drank
cold
the
16
ounce
can
gets
too
warm
before
you
get
down
to
the
end
releasing
that
dms
flavor
they
so
cleverly
tried
to
mask
by
dry
hopping
great
can
great
story
but
the
crisp
is
too
malty
sweet
the
bitterness
is
an
after
note
there
are
some
great
lager
moments
in
this
beer
though
the
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
all
malt
lager
scent
along
with
an
array
of
german
hops
its
crisp
with
actual
malt
character
the
taste
is
great
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
along
with
a
damn
fine
german
hop
bitterness
its
flavorful
with
a
solid
malt
base
easy
drinking
with
just
enough
sweetness
to
balance
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
lager
i
can
get
behind
its
crisp
with
sacrificing
the
flavor
this
is
a
highly
hopped
pils
good
starting
pale
malt
flavor
no
grain
as
in
the
smell
peppery
bitterness
that
lasts
long
after
the
swallow
very
rich
for
a
pilsner
a
very
special
beer
to
drink
if
you
prefer
your
pils
bitter
excellent
entry
for
a
novice
to
appreciate
real
beer
and
complex
enough
for
the
advanced
aficionado
thanks
sixpoint
for
creating
this
beer
nice
light
pour
golden
straw
in
color
with
a
tight
fizzy
head
of
white
foam
that
quickly
gained
ground
and
rose
up
through
the
glass
nice
an
light
aroma
clean
light
spice
and
yeast
notes
hints
of
light
citrus
wheat
light
cloves
really
well
done
as
i
take
the
first
sips
clean
crisp
flavor
tight
citrus
rich
light
grains
spakrling
carbonation
really
it
just
worked
light
bready
finish
left
a
light
touch
of
flavor
on
the
palate
but
mostly
clean
after
the
last
sip
love
pilsners
and
love
the
crisp
o
a
pretty
decent
pilsner
especially
for
an
american
made
one
pretty
refreshing
note
to
the
hard
workers
at
sixpoint
please
can
more
beers
keep
up
the
good
work
i
look
forward
to
trying
the
other
ones
d
the
crisp
is
a
great
german
pilsner
put
it
next
to
prima
as
the
ultimate
lawn
mowing
brew
i
want
more
well
balanced
with
an
initial
doughy
sweetness
followed
by
a
crisp
clean
hoppy
finish
light
and
zippy
mouthfeel
with
effervescent
carbonation
all
around
great
beer
probably
the
best
american
made
german
pils
ive
ever
had
o
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
an
incredible
surprise
from
sixpoint
one
of
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
a
definite
buy
for
me
i
was
thrilled
to
see
the
beer
in
the
can
just
as
refreshing
and
flavorful
as
the
draft
version
ill
be
buying
another
four
pack
soon
o
this
is
what
you
imagined
beer
tasting
like
when
you
were
a
young
lad
and
you
saw
the
big
imposing
american
macro
advertisement
in
your
favorite
teams
ball
park
until
the
day
you
realized
that
the
american
macro
is
for
frat
parties
and
beer
pong
and
to
be
disrespected
this
is
what
a
pilsner
should
have
been
my
first
time
around
clear
gold
with
a
soapy
cap
of
white
foam
the
frothy
head
fell
quickly
leaving
a
thin
skim
of
bubbles
on
top
of
the
beer
and
quite
a
bit
of
clumpy
lacing
on
the
glass
floral
and
grassy
hop
aroma
a
little
spicy
with
some
dry
malt
and
fruity
undertones
hoppy
and
malty
up
front
fruity
then
dry
bitterness
kicks
in
towards
the
end
more
floral
and
spicy
notes
light
citrus
medium
bodied
creamy
mouthfeel
rather
than
crisp
moderate
carbonation
overall
pretty
solid
and
a
tasty
beer
overall
quite
an
impressive
germanstyle
pilsner
worth
trying
lighter
body
nice
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
nice
amount
of
character
o
i
wouldnt
have
pegged
this
as
an
american
pilsner
it
is
extremely
balanced
in
almost
every
way
mouthful
could
be
a
little
more
round
but
the
flavors
are
so
nice
its
a
small
detail
excellent
summer
drinking
overall
its
a
decent
hoppy
lager
that
doesnt
quite
excite
me
like
noble
pils
or
a
fresh
prima
pils
but
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
or
recommending
to
a
crossover
drinker
a
delicious
highly
drinkable
beer
in
the
pilsener
style
one
of
the
few
american
pilseners
that
adds
it
own
unique
character
to
the
style
but
keeps
it
right
in
the
pocket
its
known
for
would
i
buy
more
of
it
definitely
great
beer
loved
all
16
oz
of
it
and
will
certainly
be
buying
more
cubes
many
thanks
to
woodychandler
for
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
head
smell
is
sweet
malts
and
hops
are
in
there
taste
is
a
bit
hoppy
for
this
style
some
malts
are
present
finishes
bitter
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
while
not
a
bad
beer
i
feel
it
is
a
little
bit
over
hopped
for
this
style
overall
a
great
beer
pretty
much
the
definition
of
sessionable
great
crisp
lager
flavors
a
nice
malt
flavor
and
aroma
and
just
the
right
about
of
fresh
grassy
mild
hops
of
which
get
just
a
bit
too
spicy
and
bitter
on
the
finish
but
im
just
nitpicking
at
that
point
overall
its
a
good
offering
from
sixpoint
i
should
probably
get
out
to
the
brewery
this
summer
these
boys
know
what
they
are
doing
in
the
can
the
crack
glug
netted
two
foamy
fingers
of
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
very
grassy
hops
flavor
saaz
perhaps
but
i
could
not
quite
place
it
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
soft
grassy
hops
presence
on
the
tongue
it
was
definitely
a
germanstyle
pils
as
opposed
to
a
czech
pils
given
the
muted
nature
of
the
hops
yinz
want
to
know
what
to
can
next
a
czech
pils
go
for
more
than
just
a
kiss
of
the
hops
you
buncha
schlitz
i
have
to
admit
it
was
crisp
both
in
terms
of
taste
and
finish
but
it
wasnt
crisp
enough
it
should
have
been
as
crisp
as
lettuce
or
celery
but
it
was
only
carrot
crisp
im
feeling
pretty
crisp
about
now
can
i
see
myself
putting
this
into
the
cooler
sure
im
not
that
hung
up
on
crispness
at
first
i
get
reminded
of
macros
i
have
had
but
with
a
few
sips
and
some
time
it
really
gets
better
golden
yellow
with
a
large
amount
of
fluffy
white
inch
high
head
lemon
grassy
aroma
with
a
hint
of
soured
malt
the
flavor
has
a
lemon
citrus
bite
a
sweet
and
light
malt
body
with
a
grassy
and
sour
lemon
finish
crisp
and
biting
at
the
end
but
not
dry
overall
really
an
outstanding
beer
that
is
now
a
candidate
to
be
drank
all
summer
long
between
this
and
sweet
action
sixpoint
is
really
killing
it
on
the
lower
side
of
the
abv
scale
odthird
sixpoint
i
have
tried
still
need
to
try
the
sweet
action
this
one
is
my
least
favorite
not
horrible
but
just
not
what
im
looking
for
bengali
tiger
absolutely
blows
this
one
away
and
the
righteous
ale
also
beats
this
one
out
quite
easily
give
it
a
shot
for
me
not
my
style
very
nice
refreshing
pils
with
spot
on
carbonation
crisp
indeed
tingly
palate
cleansing
carbonation
earthy
pine
riddled
hops
showing
spicy
qualities
with
some
floral
accents
on
the
finish
bready
throughout
and
really
just
a
quaff
monster
would
love
to
have
these
cans
at
my
disposal
in
the
lovely
land
of
ohio
well
maybe
not
lovely

o
im
really
liking
how
sixpoint
crafts
their
beers
to
be
quite
uniqur
and
enjoyable
loving
the
nanokeg
cans
i
enjoyed
this
by
the
pool
and
recommend
this
as
a
summer
beer
for
pilsner
lovers
overall
this
beer
tastes
very
fresh
very
crisp
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
each
ingredient
really
stands
its
own
yet
the
whole
package
just
goes
so
well
together
though
a
relatively
simple
lager
there
is
nothing
cheap
about
it
really
a
fantastic
session
beer
o
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
can
be
considered
sessionable
d
very
drinkable
nice
mix
and
balance
of
flavors
that
mix
together
well
and
avoid
from
feeling
empty
it
also
stays
super
light
and
crisp
without
feeling
empty
previously
my
favorite
lager
was
samuel
smith
but
i
now
have
a
new
favorite
and
yes
its
now
clear
to
me
that
the
best
brewery
in
brooklyn
doesnt
have
brooklyn
in
its
name
thanks
to
joe
at
black
rock
wines
and
spirits
in
fairfield
ct
for
the
sample
of
this
i
will
certainly
be
drinking
more
as
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
most
drinkable
beers
so
far
this
year
this
is
the
recently
canned
version
pours
a
standard
but
very
clean
looking
yellowy
color
thin
head
nose
is
subtle
grassy
hops
and
some
faint
apple
notes
taste
follows
suit
with
a
nice
kiss
of
hops
earthy
and
musty
and
a
faint
fruity
notes
of
grain
and
some
husk
crisp
had
to
and
prickly
on
the
palate
very
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
great
to
be
drinking
sixpoint
at
home
on
my
couch
cant
wait
to
try
their
other
canned
offerings
a
well
made
pils
great
grassy
flavors
i
wish
it
was
just
a
bit
more
carbonated
o
this
is
one
damn
tasty
brew
that
drinks
so
well
this
beer
definitely
has
it
going
on
and
would
definitely
recommend
trying
this
one
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style
on
tap
at
spritzinger
in
brooklyn
for
6pint
poured
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
short
white
head
clearly
an
american
take
on
the
style
the
hops
dominated
the
character
they
were
the
more
floral
less
spicy
type
of
nobel
hops
pretty
similar
to
sam
adams
noble
pils
id
guess
tettnanger
overall
it
was
a
tasty
hoppy
pils
but
i
wanted
a
little
more
depth
from
the
malt
of
which
there
wasnt
much
flavor
and
variation
in
the
hops
bight
golden
lively
with
a
creamy
white
foam
head
nose
is
very
delicate
with
soft
bready
malt
and
floral
hop
aromas
and
a
hint
of
hardboiled
egg
prickly
carbonation
up
front
and
like
its
name
suggests
this
is
one
crispvery
crispbeer
nice
bite
of
herbal
and
pith
with
a
quick
snap
of
dry
bitterness
and
suggestions
of
mint
and
green
wood
it
eventually
yields
to
a
smooth
but
firm
body
malt
character
is
expectedly
light
touch
of
honey
and
a
complementary
biscuity
note
that
pairs
well
with
the
beers
crispness
and
adds
more
depth
to
the
overall
dryness
of
the
beer
very
quenching
moreish
and
insanely
drinkable
one
of
our
favorite
sixpoint
offerings
to
date
tastes
like
a
fresh
import
zwei
maß
crisp
bitte
good
representation
of
the
style
and
another
fine
effort
from
sixpoint
twas
finely
poured
from
the
taps
at
the
commons
low
low
carb
barely
floating
atop
the
clear
beverage
morning
toast
some
granulation
and
grassy
earthy
hops
are
in
my
nose
the
beer
is
tasty
munichly
malty
with
some
hop
presence
fairly
low
bitterness
it
is
okay
good
for
an
american
rep
of
a
german
pils
i
was
in
no
way
offended
by
this
beverage
quite
drinkable
in
fact
drinkability
very
refreshing
with
a
clean
crisp
character
a
very
well
made
pils
six
point
has
crafted
a
relatively
modest
in
alcohol
content
session
pilsner
thats
exceptionally
quaffable
and
deserves
a
higher
ranking
among
the
big
craft
breweries
and
their
mediocre
lager
offerings
i
would
like
a
little
more
hop
bite
to
my
pilsner
but
i
dont
think
that
is
what
sixpoint
was
going
for
with
this
one
it
certainly
is
crisp
and
quaffable
which
means
it
was
a
success
d
a
really
nice
pilsner
not
quite
prima
good
but
a
nice
addition
to
the
sixpoint
crisp
lager
line
md
the
nice
amount
of
carbonation
just
add
the
drinkablility
of
this
beer
while
at
the
spinnerstown
with
a
coworker
that
doesnt
get
much
beer
variety
i
chose
this
over
a
bunch
of
dipas
and
stouts
it
was
a
good
choice
for
both
us
12
oz
bottle
from
safeway
pours
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
flavor
is
dry
grassy
hops
and
biscuit
malt
with
light
lemon
and
citrus
hops
finish
and
a
tiny
bit
of
skunk
light
bodied
with
nice
peppery
carbonation
crisp
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
light
yet
classic
german
pilsener
great
balance
really
nice
i
think
this
brewery
specializes
in
one
thing
pilsners
which
is
good
because
this
is
really
great
has
the
typical
euro
smell
but
the
taste
is
very
smooth
the
taste
is
where
this
shines
from
nose
to
mouth
to
finish
is
wonderful
as
far
as
first
impressions
do
get
that
slight
hop
smell
up
front
definitely
smell
the
saaz
nice
speckled
residue
in
the
head
lacing
looks
like
its
snowing
out
my
window
very
clear
and
light
very
good
pils
but
pricey
outlier
review
of
trumer
pils
amazingly
refreshing
pilsner
done
overall
this
is
pretty
much
just
a
lager
but
one
that
is
au72
for
a
case
of
24
completely
unacceptable
for
a
beer
that
really
isnt
all
that
good
or
exciting
the
worst
pilsner
in
the
world
p
s
im
not
sure
if
the
skunkiness
is
attributable
to
the
green
glass
bottle
or
hops
trumer
pils
45
its
crisp
and
light
plenty
refreshing
but
that
bite
does
build
its
clean
for
most
of
the
way
through
until
it
catches
up
theres
an
aroma
of
faded
hops
and
aspirations
pun
intended
the
flavor
has
a
musty
character
that
makes
me
think
of
green
apple
cider
and
grains
with
a
bit
of
wet
grass
i
cant
help
but
wonder
how
much
more
this
beer
could
be
if
it
wasnt
in
green
glass
the
taste
is
very
good
with
slight
hop
flavor
up
front
with
low
astringency
and
mild
grassy
aspect
with
gentle
herbal
noble
type
flavor
with
mild
malt
sweetness
and
gentle
yeast
in
the
taste
with
some
low
diacetyl
in
the
finish
making
it
seem
smooth
i
like
the
noble
hop
character
i
get
in
the
taste
which
makes
the
hop
seem
less
bitter
in
taste
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsner
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
value
if
you
like
german
lagers
as
i
get
further
down
the
glass
it
seems
a
bit
mild
so
i
dropped
the
rating
a
little
still
a
very
good
beer
summary
kind
of
undecided
on
this
one
trumer
pils
has
a
great
presence
minus
the
smell
but
it
kind
of
disappoints
me
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
maybe
i
expected
too
much
still
though
an
average
pilsner
trumer
pours
a
very
clear
yellow
and
is
highly
carbonated
so
a
big
fine
head
forms
without
too
much
lace
the
aroma
is
bready
and
malty
and
reminds
me
of
more
common
euro
style
pils
very
pale
malts
lead
to
a
very
bitter
flavor
that
is
nice
but
a
little
overpowering
by
the
end
of
a
bottle
or
two
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
there
isnt
anything
that
really
stands
out
or
really
draws
me
back
to
it
trumer
pils
is
a
little
too
carbonated
for
my
taste
and
the
bitter
aftertaste
comes
in
a
little
too
strong
for
the
style
of
pilsner
i
am
used
to
poured
into
a
schaumburger
pilsner
glass
pours
a
light
straw
amber
with
hints
of
gold
thin
white
head
disssipates
quickly
to
a
thin
film
and
ring
around
the
glass
with
light
lacing
aroma
of
biscuit
malt
light
lemon
and
citrus
hops
with
skunkiness
on
opening
dissipating
to
a
hint
of
skunk
in
the
open
glass
flavor
is
dry
grassy
hops
and
crackery
biscuit
malt
finishing
with
light
lemon
and
citrus
hops
and
sadly
haunted
by
a
wisp
of
skunk
light
bodied
with
nice
peppery
carbonation
a
light
pilsner
hitting
all
the
correct
german
pilsner
notes
in
malt
and
hops
a
bit
drier
and
subdued
than
normal
but
the
dryness
is
nice
for
a
change
how
sad
that
how
much
effort
was
put
into
setting
up
a
brewery
in
the
us
to
produce
fresher
pilsner
and
then
let
it
get
light
struck
in
a
green
bottle
not
bad
but
ill
be
looking
for
my
pilsner
fix
elsewhere
o
decent
drinker
that
goes
down
easy
overall
a
well
made
german
pils
all
kinds
of
aite
down
the
line
nah
id
say
better
than
aite
but
its
like
cameron
diaz
in
the
90s
if
it
was
in
front
of
me
and
ready
to
go
sure
raul
would
hop
on
it
but
he
wouldnt
exactly
seek
it
out
o
just
fine
not
something
i
would
seek
out
to
serve
to
myself
or
others
but
not
a
beer
choice
i
could
fault
someone
for
making
if
looking
for
something
that
is
light
and
refreshing
but
not
miserable
i
wont
go
out
of
my
way
to
revisit
this
beer
but
could
see
myself
picking
this
up
preferentially
out
of
common
offerings
at
social
events
o
one
of
the
best
you
can
find
in
a
six
pack
easy
to
drink
flavorful
and
clean
56
a
great
take
on
the
style
and
as
simple
and
subtle
as
this
beer
is
its
wholly
enjoyable
years
ago
i
didnt
seem
to
like
it
as
much
but
after
a
long
busy
day
i
would
happily
take
one
of
these
to
set
alongside
myself
as
a
doze
off
to
the
late
hours
of
the
evening
good
stuff
and
local
too
overall
a
tasty
and
drinkable
pilsner
not
a
showstopper
but
decent
enough
that
id
have
it
again
overall
drinkability
not
really
impressed
but
not
offended
this
is
a
nice
german
pils
kind
of
grassy
a
pretty
consistent
character
to
it
and
fairly
smooth
there
is
some
tang
to
it
and
what
seems
like
a
thicker
malty
sweetness
to
it
as
well
overall
its
a
pretty
easy
drinker
and
a
good
alternative
to
anything
yellow
and
fizzy
you
cant
really
go
wrong
with
it
pours
a
murky
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
streaks
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
grass
and
some
slight
skunk
aromas
that
start
to
go
away
after
i
pour
the
beer
into
a
glass
taste
is
of
grain
herbal
hops
and
some
alcohol
there
is
a
mild
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
skunk
aroma
blast
i
got
when
opening
the
bottle
was
not
too
pleasant
i
wanted
something
light
and
sessionable
tonight
and
i
just
met
my
new
summer
beer
trumer
pils
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
hint
of
floral
hops
zero
malt
flavor
drinkable
and
the
aroma
was
near
perfect
for
a
pilsner
one
that
has
the
markings
of
being
specialized
and
well
crafted
care
need
to
be
taken
with
how
this
one
is
served
o
this
is
from
cali
not
bad
at
all
i
could
knock
back
a
six
pack
of
this
stuff
no
problem
pours
a
light
wheat
color
with
a
soapy
white
head
white
lacing
remains
on
the
glass
as
the
beer
is
consumed
tart
hard
candy
and
perhaps
some
notes
of
banana
very
nicely
carbonated
sweet
ripe
banana
notes
balance
the
tart
fruit
very
good
pilsner
i
almost
never
like
beers
in
this
style
too
much
but
this
one
hit
the
spot
for
me
coming
off
a
big
playoff
win
in
beer
league
hockey
one
of
the
boys
broke
out
a
case
of
this
stuff
ice
cold
i
enjoyed
the
first
couple
right
from
the
bottle
great
malty
nose
that
promises
refreshment
flavor
is
balanced
but
the
german
malts
are
on
display
here
extra
crisp
finish
that
leaves
you
needing
another
the
feel
though
is
what
makes
this
beer
for
me
its
very
bubbly
and
majorly
light
in
the
body
but
without
being
watery
and
flavorless
at
all
its
a
perfect
postathletic
beer
and
you
can
drink
a
fair
few
of
them
without
much
trouble
this
is
up
there
for
me
with
the
better
american
pilseners
that
ive
had
some
of
the
micro
gurus
wont
want
to
hear
that
but
in
the
right
setting
this
is
a
very
very
solid
beer
see
for
yourself
highly
enjoyable
on
its
own
and
pairs
great
with
food
i
was
able
to
try
the
trumer
pils
on
tap
at
the
kendall
pub
in
yorkville
il
the
beer
was
served
in
a
cylindrical
5l
glass
it
poured
a
golden
clear
color
a
dense
white
head
and
plenty
lacing
occured
on
the
glass
the
scent
was
common
of
most
pils
with
saaz
hop
kickin
it
real
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
mouthfeel
was
great
with
medium
body
and
great
carbonation
overall
a
very
clean
beer
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
beer
takes
me
back
to
munich
and
helps
me
understand
why
people
like
lagers
i
can
drink
this
all
day
and
not
feel
full
no
wonder
the
germans
stick
to
this
style
without
complaint
if
only
the
big
three
could
make
something
close
to
this
instead
of
just
tasting
like
lightly
flavored
water
this
has
many
subtle
flavors
to
it
with
different
notes
being
played
a
little
louder
with
each
gulp
im
pretty
happy
this
is
brewed
an
hour
away
from
me
in
berkeley
a
trip
to
deutschland
is
only
a
six
pack
away
finally
getting
around
to
one
of
the
more
readilyavailable
pilsners
out
there
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
bright
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
light
lemon
zest
flowers
and
straight
wheat
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
grass
and
the
flowers
taking
control
providing
a
nicely
subdued
bitterness
throughout
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
crisp
finish
overall
a
great
pils
one
of
the
best
ive
found
stateside
its
almost
too
easy
to
drink
really
drink
a
solid
3
5
all
across
the
board
as
i
stated
above
its
more
than
average
but
not
quite
their
yet
to
me
it
needs
a
bit
more
balanced
and
pop
but
i
would
come
back
to
this
one
in
a
pinch
o
good
solid
easy
drinking
german
style
pils
i
had
this
beer
from
an
all
around
the
world
combo
pack
i
got
at
the
world
market
i
honestly
couldnt
taste
what
people
get
excited
about
with
this
beer
it
was
fine
but
nothing
special
its
biggest
problem
is
that
i
couldnt
taste
a
unique
timbre
i
look
for
in
every
beer
i
drink
it
just
tasted
very
standard
to
me
o
ordinary
pilsner
thats
too
watery
and
no
crispness
with
not
much
standing
out
i
would
not
recommend
it
o
not
a
bad
beer
nor
a
good
beer
i
think
this
is
an
average
beer
maybe
just
a
little
above
average
but
it
is
surely
very
drinkable
a
classic
german
pilsner
brewed
in
california
that
goes
exceptionally
well
with
food
the
taste
was
pretty
average
though
so
im
not
complaining
i
wouldnt
buy
a
six
pack
though
conclusion
before
finishing
this
beer
i
paired
it
with
some
sharp
cheddar
to
see
how
that
would
affect
the
flavor
overall
i
feel
that
this
beer
knows
what
it
is
doing
and
is
doing
it
well
this
is
a
great
pilsner
and
my
previous
hesitation
was
due
to
the
fact
that
this
beer
attacks
with
palate
without
asking
permission
which
is
a
great
thing
in
my
opinion
o
this
is
a
good
everyday
type
of
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
tastes
good
that
you
can
drink
a
number
of
because
its
light
and
refreshing
that
helps
out
on
hot
days
worth
a
try
and
im
not
a
big
pils
person
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
im
really
glad
they
started
brewing
this
one
in
berkeley
its
smooth
crisp
and
light
but
flavorful
a
goto
beer
for
me
whenever
im
in
the
bay
area
or
anywhere
this
beer
is
served
an
exemplary
german
pils
o
a
good
pilsner
for
sure
but
whats
with
the
green
bottles
youd
think
an
american
brewery
would
know
better
especially
in
this
style
light
body
smooth
ample
carbonation
that
softly
scrubs
the
tongue
clean
with
each
sip
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
o
always
a
good
choice
for
a
refreshing
beer
solid
stuff
not
bad
but
not
a
favorite
trumer
pils
affords
the
people
of
the
bay
area
a
taste
of
what
fresh
and
honest
german
or
austrian
pilsners
are
really
like
its
very
rare
to
find
such
clean
malt
and
zesty
hop
character
in
the
emasculated
and
heavily
pasteurized
bottles
and
cans
that
find
their
way
over
here
from
europe
these
guys
may
only
brew
one
beer
but
they
brew
it
exceptionally
well
overall
pretty
good
im
not
blown
away
like
the
paulaner
but
am
satisfied
as
far
as
an
americanized
german
pilsner
goes
good
hopping
done
in
this
one
overall
this
is
an
excellent
beer
i
love
pilsners
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
its
incredibly
drinkable
at
well
overall
a
very
nice
and
solid
pilsener
i
am
not
at
all
upset
that
i
have
23
more
bottles
to
drink
very
good
stuff
taste
refreshing
easy
to
drink
gets
the
lager
yeast
mouthfeel
just
right
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
into
a
light
drinkable
brew
seems
like
they
do
the
saaz
andor
glacier
hop
thing
works
well
with
this
pale
malt
this
is
a
beer
that
should
satisfy
everyone
in
a
room
no
matter
their
tastes
nor
backgrounds
hopheads
who
arent
completely
opposed
to
a
beer
that
isnt
an
ipa
chicks
faux
euro
guy
goateed
coffee
shop
types
beer
geeks
moms
dads
i
think
everyone
can
like
this
beer
overall
4
i
had
heard
very
good
things
about
this
one
and
we
dont
get
it
out
east
so
i
was
excited
to
try
it
its
definitely
a
solid
version
of
this
style
a
bit
americanized
perhaps
which
is
just
fine
with
me
but
it
doesnt
strike
me
as
a
beer
worth
raving
about
maybe
thats
just
the
boldbig
bias
o
good
enjoyable
pilsener
hard
to
spot
flaws
here
pick
it
up
if
you
get
a
chance
overall
i
love
this
pilsner
i
will
admit
im
partial
to
it
because
it
is
brewed
locally
in
berkeley
ca
but
i
think
it
is
outstanding
nonetheless
great
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
flavor
this
is
a
great
pils
great
mouthfeel
hoppy
and
incredibly
drinkable
mouthfeel
is
great
as
the
beer
is
smooth
clean
crisp
and
the
finish
is
quick
and
neutral
a
light
floral
sensation
is
left
on
the
tongue
but
aside
from
that
this
beer
sets
you
right
up
for
the
next
swig
abv
of
4
8
makes
this
incredibly
sessionable
as
well
probably
would
pick
this
over
just
about
any
other
beer
if
i
was
at
an
outdoor
sporting
event
had
a
couple
pints
on
tap
at
the
gingerman
in
austin
man
i
wish
this
were
available
out
east
id
just
had
a
live
oak
pilz
which
was
a
wonderfully
hoppy
take
on
the
style
this
by
comparison
has
a
balance
between
the
hops
and
malt
while
still
having
a
huge
flavor
impact
the
malts
are
smooth
dry
and
bready
the
hops
are
a
lemon
and
herbal
spice
blend
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
extremely
drinkable
beer
and
a
good
example
with
pilsener
is
a
great
style
a
good
german
style
exemplar
d
isnt
this
one
of
the
definitions
of
session
beer
great
example
of
the
style
very
watery
body
ontap
at
five
star
bar
here
in
chicago
maybe
i
am
not
openminded
enough
but
there
are
certain
things
i
look
for
in
a
pilsener
a
clean
energetic
funkiness
in
the
nose
that
excites
you
for
a
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
followup
funkiness
medium
abv
high
drinkability
and
refreshingness
round
out
the
goals
of
this
style
in
my
opinion
trumer
pils
delivers
on
a
very
crisp
and
smooth
mouthfeel
it
is
also
quite
refreshing
its
a
good
looking
beer
too
very
clean
where
it
fails
to
reach
the
top
is
in
the
yeast
funkiness
i
think
its
worth
trying
once
but
its
not
in
my
top
10
pilseners
d
this
is
a
leading
contender
for
the
pilsner
i
would
like
to
clone
for
my
next
brew
needless
to
say
i
like
it
a
lot
much
like
the
bottle
shows
it
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
that
has
a
lemon
scent
to
it
the
lemon
flavor
continues
into
the
taste
making
it
a
very
smooth
and
easy
drinking
beer
great
taste
and
just
the
right
volume
to
go
with
it
definetly
reccomend
as
a
summer
beer
we
have
the
right
to
edit
our
review
after
further
investigation
a
nice
quaffing
lager
smell
and
taste
wonderful
it
drinks
the
best
if
one
is
downright
panting
and
dying
for
a
quench
of
thirst
but
it
also
drinks
excellent
when
relaxing
with
an
empty
stomach
since
its
carbonation
would
make
your
stomach
expand
and
cause
you
to
burp
nonstop
fabulous
session
beer
would
glad
to
bring
home
another
sixer
soon
the
beer
is
good
german
pilsner
the
color
is
light
blonde
with
a
thin
white
head
with
good
retention
the
nose
has
hints
of
sweet
malt
and
a
very
slight
hint
of
biscuit
the
beer
has
crisp
taste
with
sweet
malt
and
saaz
hop
flavor
the
mounthfeel
is
smooth
with
light
body
and
a
bite
of
carbonation
that
lingers
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
this
beer
is
great
on
a
hot
day
or
for
any
chillin
in
front
of
the
tv
id
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
loves
a
good
pils
overallan
outstanding
pilsner
great
flavor
nice
balance
very
drinkable
a
triumph
i
found
it
very
good
most
pilsners
follow
in
line
this
does
not
d
could
drink
a
case
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
really
easy
to
drink
with
only
a
touch
of
noticeable
alcohol
good
stuff
served
in
a
cylindrical
pint
glass
at
the
flying
saucer
in
austin
strawgolden
and
crystal
clear
dense
white
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
spicy
hop
aroma
with
a
bit
of
graininess
from
the
malt
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
very
clean
with
a
nice
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
true
to
a
pilsner
my
issues
with
the
taste
are
just
that
its
so
damn
light
even
for
a
beer
that
should
be
mellow
too
subdued
on
the
taste
goes
down
very
easy
good
beer
to
chill
out
with
for
a
night
very
inoffensive
so
hard
to
get
one
of
these
thats
still
fresh
and
isnt
lightstruck
i
at
least
succeeded
in
that
bright
golden
hue
head
is
even
and
consistent
nice
lacing
aromas
are
of
subtle
floral
hops
but
theyre
a
touch
dull
flavourwise
its
not
bad
good
spiciness
with
an
assertie
malt
presence
hop
flavours
are
also
present
but
not
obtrusive
at
all
some
may
say
i
dont
appreciate
subtle
beer
flavours
but
ive
never
been
particularly
excited
by
this
beer
would
love
to
one
day
try
it
fresh
off
the
tap
im
giving
this
one
high
marks
for
the
style
not
necessarily
compared
to
all
beers
for
a
pilsner
it
definitely
goes
at
the
top
of
my
list
it
has
a
light
but
satisfying
flavor
and
most
of
all
its
about
as
refreshing
as
beer
can
get
while
still
maintaining
a
unique
character
if
you
live
on
the
west
coast
trumer
is
the
freshest
authentic
tasting
pilsner
ive
found
so
far
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
good
lacing
subtle
smell
flowery
and
clean
taste
is
also
subtle
nice
bite
refreshing
from
start
to
finish
notable
but
mellow
hops
saaz
and
virtually
no
malt
tasteable
this
is
a
very
very
good
technical
beer
slightly
too
subtle
for
my
taste
but
definitely
one
of
the
premier
american
pilsners
that
notably
tastes
more
austrian
as
fits
the
brewery
overall
it
is
decent
but
not
perfect
i
drank
this
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
gold
lots
of
carbonation
medium
clear
nice
white
head
that
stays
forever
with
really
nice
lacing
the
aroma
isnt
great
a
little
hops
but
a
weird
metallic
skunk
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
light
hops
a
bitter
metal
finish
the
feel
is
nice
pretty
easy
to
drink
very
enjoyable
at
mr
as
in
san
diego
cheers
drinkability
i
would
pass
up
this
unless
faced
with
the
alternative
of
an
adjunct
lager
or
light
beer
it
wasnt
very
impressive
not
special
the
glass
was
cool
thanks
beer
rep
d
a
wellmade
pilsener
provides
a
nice
experience
without
being
overly
complicated
i
have
passed
this
beer
over
many
times
and
finally
decided
to
give
it
a
shot
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
thats
what
i
get
for
being
snobbish
this
example
was
brewed
by
the
original
brewery
trumer
privatbrauerei
in
salzburg
austria
but
the
appearance
of
the
bottle
appears
quite
similar
to
the
provided
picture
with
the
added
einzigartig
wie
du
unique
just
like
you
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
an
easy
slide
good
for
a
lager
combined
with
the
tang
this
is
an
easydrinker
just
dont
put
it
in
the
fridge
for
more
than
15
minutes
notes
as
a
person
who
doesnt
find
himself
drinking
many
pilsners
this
was
very
nice
a
very
good
example
of
this
style
i
must
admit
im
having
flashbacks
to
my
time
in
germany
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
beer
a
very
easy
to
drink
pils
d
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
not
a
lot
to
this
beer
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
you
but
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
would
be
perfect
on
a
summer
day
thanks
to
dons
friend
for
hauling
these
from
chicago
and
don
for
sharing
this
is
an
all
day
beer
one
that
you
can
have
several
of
clean
and
crisp
taste
there
is
a
slight
aftertaste
with
this
beer
almost
a
cereal
bitter
aftertaste
its
not
hops
at
all
in
fact
there
is
no
detectable
hop
bitterness
at
all
but
thats
fine
for
this
style
i
dont
have
great
criteria
for
these
german
pilseners
but
this
is
similar
and
as
drinkable
as
the
others
mouthfeel
is
good
its
a
little
thicker
than
i
expected
but
overall
its
really
nice
drinkability
is
high
but
this
is
really
a
pretty
drinkable
style
overall
and
this
beer
doesnt
stand
out
from
other
pilsners
in
that
respect
overall
pretty
decent
pilsener
i
wasnt
wowed
but
a
nice
session
beer
nonetheless

very

and
i
thank
arbitrator
for
this
extra
exceptionally
clean
on
the
feel
light

with
delicate
carbonation
drinkability
should
be
high
but
i
rarely
have
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
for
some
reason
while
probably
not
the
best
out
there
this
is
overall
a
nice
pils
that
has
been
becoming
a
more
frequent
tenant
in
my
fridge
in
recent
years
yay
a
lager
that
i
like
12
oz
bottle
from
makeyourown
variety
6
pack
to
glass
looks
like
a
bud
on
the
pour
golden
yellow
average
head
not
a
lot
on
the
nose
a
typical
weak
lager
aroma
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
for
a
lighter
beer
style
very
drinkable
carbonation
is
there
but
not
as
aggressive
as
most
lagers
ive
had
tasting
the
justenoughsweetness
malt
and
actually
quite
a
bit
of
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
to
me
its
the
most
alelike
of
lagers
ive
had
i
e
fuller
flavor
and
less
carbonation
not
sure
about
the
calories
but
the
abv
suggests
its
not
a
bad
choice
for
session
or
light
beer
needs
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
ive
always
had
and
liked
and
so
glad
my
mate
bought
a
carton
of
it
so
i
can
review
it
as
this
is
my
favourite
styleit
pours
a
clear
as
golden
straw
colour
with
nice
sparkling
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
with
average
lacingthe
aromas
straight
up
are
fresh
noble
hops
followed
by
some
freshly
cut
grassit
has
a
nice
easy
mouthfeel
for
the
style
which
goes
down
ever
so
smooth
with
the
noble
hops
definately
coming
to
the
forefront
and
being
the
standout
charactr
of
this
beer
and
woulkd
definately
recommend
this
beer
as
a
nice
session
beer
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
smells
like
fresh
noble
hops
its
actually
pretty
impressive
how
fresh
it
smells
like
im
holding
a
fistful
of
hallertau
or
something
theres
only
a
slight
bitterness
present
despite
the
very
hopforward
aroma
mild
pale
malts
are
fitting
if
maybe
a
little
understated
drinks
very
easy
on
a
hot
day
a
pretty
good
pilsener
this
rivals
most
of
the
wellknown
imports
but
lacks
a
bit
of
personality
and
gumption
to
make
it
stand
out
on
its
own
d
pilsners
dont
get
enough
respect
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
one
and
its
worth
the
price
of
a
sixpack
if
only
theyd
stop
using
those
damn
green
bottles
i
poured
this
sidebyside
with
a
warsteinger
verum
both
from
bottles
the
warsteiner
has
a
strong
aroma
the
trumer
almost
none
very
sublte
the
taste
reflected
this
the
warsteiner
had
a
sharpness
to
it
i
liked
the
trumer
seemed
flat
and
watery
in
comparison
i
definitely
prefer
to
warsteiner
just
one
mans
opinion
clear
golden
brew
big
three
finger
rocky
head
challenged
top
of

fairly
quick
dissipation
with
decent
lacing
sweet
malts
predominate
in

and
taste

with
a
bit
of
piney
hop
presence
leading
to
a
dry
finish
happy
mouthfeel
good
carbonation
very
very
quaffable
a
nice
session
beer
in
my
mind
one
of
americas
best
interpretations
of
this
classic
style
d
very
very
easy
drinking
at
under
5
many
of
these
could
be
enjoyed
great
for
summertime
weeknights
watching
a
ballgame
o
its
a
whisper
of
a
beer
it
gives
you
just
enough
of
a
pils
taste
then
finishes
with
no
after
taste
to
speak
of
i
guess
this
could
be
called
a
session
beer
its
good
to
clear
the
mouth
when
eating
i
like
it
it
arrived
with
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
the
color
was
the
real
selling
point
a
beautiful
pale
goldenyellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
the
nose
was
phenomenal
lots
of
saaz
this
was
like
victory
prima
pils
just
dialed
back
enough
to
make
it
eminently
drinkable
i
love
lager
styles
i
love
victory
beers
but
the
prima
pils
is
too
intense
for
my
taste
this
was
kind
of
thin
on
the
tongue
but
it
had
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
tickle
my
taste
buds
it
is
like
putting
your
finger
on
the
trigger
of
a
gun
or
on
a
lovers
nipple
do
you
mean
to
lightly
brush
it
right
or
squeeze
the
crap
out
of
it
wrong
i
totally
dug
this
beer
the
finish
was
dry
lightly
hoppy
perfect
the
low
abv
makes
it
entirely
sessionable
the
body
was
pleasantly
full
for
the
style
it
was
also
very
smooth
and
balanced
the
drinkability
is
truly
great
having
several
is
an
excellent
idea
this
is
not
only
my
favorite
pilsner
it
is
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
worth
seeking
out
and
enjoying
d
could
use
a
bit
more
flavor
but
there
is
enough
to
keep
you
interested
goes
down
easy
to
make
this
a
decent
session
beer
had
this
ontap
after
a
pilsner
urquell
this
came
nowhere
close
to
the
czech
hallmark
imo
dont
get
me
wrong
its
a
great
lager
but
doesnt
stack
up
to
the
original
it
looks
good
maybe
a
bit
paler
than
id
like
it
most
likely
not
decocted
it
has
the
smell
and
taste
of
an
american
lager
instead
of
the
sharp
bite
of
a
german
pils
or
the
crispness
of
the
czech
style
has
a
very
yeasty
character
to
it
bordering
on
alelike
presence
decent
mouthfeel
and
you
could
probably
drink
alot
of
this
on
a
hot
day
but
i
dont
think
it
can
hold
up
to
the
real
european
lagers

thanks
bill
i
prefer
a
larger
hop
bite
from
my
pils
but
this
is
still
a
great
beer
when
you
want
to
have
a
few
and
not
feel
stuffed
d
much
better
than
what
i
was
anticipating
maybe
its
just
that
time
of
year
where
the
weather
is
good
drinkability
is
solid
just
as
this
is
a
solid
example
of
a
stateside
brewed
german
pils
enjoyable
refreshing
and
all
around
true
to
the
style
d
judging
the
drinkability
of
a
german
pilsener
really
requires
an
enormous
glass
of
the
beer
one
could
certainly
session
this
beer
without
trouble
but
it
doesnt
inspire
me
to
go
out
and
buy
a
full
liter
stein
and
sit
on
the
porch
all
day
the
foam
when
poured
was
white
bubbly
a
little
lacey
and
longlasting
the
color
was
golden
yellow
the
smell
was
the
first
experience
to
this
beer
when
i
opened
the
bottle
a
very
dominate
wheat
pils
flavour
taste
just
like
the
smell
it
had
a
dominate
wheat
pils
taste
smooth
and
dry
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
dry
drinkibility
was
ok
had
this
brew
on
draft
the
other
night
at
the
horse
brass
pour
resulted
in
a
head
of
about
a
finger
of
light
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
covering
topping
a
golden
hued
lager
nose
was
spot
on
lager
with
a
sweet
malt
character
taste
was
classic
pilsner
with
malts
winning
the
race
over
hops
i
personally
would
have
preferred
a
heavier
noble
hop
presence
finish
was
slightly
acidic
and
body
was
light
with
a
moderate
carb
level
all
in
all
a
gooood
pilsener
trumer
pils
poured
a
very
pale
straw
color
with
very
little
head
with
decent
lacing
th
smell
was
loaded
with
hops
the
taste
matched
the
smell
tons
and
tons
of
hops
crisp
hints
of
malt
showed
as
it
warmed
a
bit
mouthfeel
was
good
for
a
pils
drinkability
was
very
nice
crisp
refreshing
not
filling
overall
i
found
this
to
be
an
excellent
beer
great
for
the
style
i
will
buy
this
again
you
can
never
have
to
many
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
beers
in
your
stash
and
this
falls
right
in
with
that
with
spring
around
the
corner
this
will
be
a
good
bbq
beer
overall
probably
one
of
the
best
german
pilseners
in
the
world
but
i
still
dont
see
why
anyone
who
likes
hops
would
choose
this
over
a
good
czech
variety
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
in
the
states
very
fresh
drinkability
a
good
german
pilsner
with
a
few
weaknesses
could
be
i
dont
know
bolder
but
still
a
good
brew
pale
yellow
fizzy
with
constant
trails
of
bubbles
two
fingers
of
foam
in
the
gaffel
stange
glass
with
intricate
lace
around
the
edge
head
retention
isnt
the
greatest
but
the
lace
and
carbonation
make
up
for
it
after
each
tilt
of
the
glass
a
swarm
of
bubbles
push
to
the
surface
clean
malty
nose
with
a
bare
hint
of
floral
noble
hops
light
crisp
taste
mild
breadiness
with
a
light
but
firm
bitterness
in
the
end
feels
clean
crisp
and
lightly
drying
a
good
pilsner
probably
fresher
than
some
german
imports
but
not
really
my
first
choice
for
a
pils
enjoy
trumer
pils
is
quite
the
tasty
little
brew
i
have
no
doubt
that
most
fresh
german
pilseners
would
taste
at
least
this
good
if
not
better
forget
the
first
two
scores
this
is
quality
beer
and
is
an
easy
recommendation
a
very
nicely
executed
pilsener
so
this
is
what
the
macros
were
shooting
for
im
still
not
a
big
pilsener
fan
but
i
do
have
a
new
favorite
pale
straw
color
and
perfectly
clear
with
a
billowing
white
head
bready
doughy
malts
in
the
nose
along
with
some
noble
hop
aromas
underneath
taste
follows
the
aroma
wellbalanced
with
a
bit
less
hop
character
than
czech
pilseners
crisp
clean
short
finish
lightbodied
and
refreshing
very
sessionable
and
thirstquenching
a
great
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
much
better
than
average
overall
this
is
a
really
good
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
astringent
but
clean
has
a
medium
body
with
a
tainting
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
a
nicely
balanced
easydrinking
sessionable
tradtional
germanstyle
pils
d
solid
if
unspectacular
german
pilsner
with
all
the
elements
of
a
good
pils
but
without
much
to
distinguish
it
from
or
elevate
it
to
the
upper
tier
the
taste
has
a
light
but
firm
malty
grain
body
with
some
bread
carrying
a
dominant
herbalgrassy
hop
flavour
and
bitterness
the
finish
is
ling
and
zestily
herbal
with
a
light
crisp
clean
bittrness
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
lager
although
the
dry
finish
keeps
it
from
being
a
better
quaffer
drinkable
but
for
pils
fans
i
think
their
is
better
out
there
seems
one
of
the
more
feminine
pils
i
have
tasted
could
gladly
sit
on
more
very
easy
to
put
down
overall
though
there
was
nothing
about
this
one
that
is
going
to
make
me
come
back
for
it
again
anytime
soon
just
not
enough
originality
or
anything
really
separating
this
one
out
from
anything
else
not
bad
but
nothing
great
i
could
drink
this
all
day
and
if
it
were
available
here
this
would
be
a
constant
in
the
garage
fridge
some
bananaclove
at
times
in
the
aroma
typical
pilsner
not
quite
the
most
crisp
but
well
carbonated
and
active
and
smooth
flavor
profile
helps
doesnt
have
any
offending
taste
characteristics
but
more
a
winter
pilsner
than
refreshing
springsummer
pilsner
clear
golden
colored
beer
very
light
in
color
with
a
fairly
well
lasting
white

nose
doesnt

a
lot
of
character
a
little
bit
of
light

maybe
some

flavor
doesnt
have
much
character
at
all
and
is
awfully
hard
to
drink
ummm
this
is
so
far
from
being
a
decent
german
pils
not
even
close
md
found
this
to
be
pleasant
overall
but
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
just
a
bit
more
hop
presence
and
bitterness
to
give
it
some
crispness
would
have
pleased
my
palate
more
d
one
of
the
most
drinkable
pilsners
ive
tried
seek
it
out
d
very
drinkable
pils
on
a
number
of
fronts
i
could
pretty
much
drink
a
lot
of
this
and
like
it
only
appropriate
that
im
drinking
a
bottle
of
this
in
berkeley
just
a
couple
of
miles
from
the
brewery
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
pure
white
head
that
is
dense
and
thick
and
slowly
settles
to
a
cap
aromas
of
lemon
grass
and
herbs
with
some
biscuity
malt
the
taste
is
similar
with
more
hop
bitterness
than
was
detectable
in
the
nose
and
with
more
of
that
biscuity
malt
the
lemon
is
still
there
and
it
is
especially
noticeable
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
relatively
soft
for
the
style
but
gently
effervescent
and
delicious
really
a
bit
different
and
just
a
wonderful
summertime
beer
well
made
and
just
a
delight
when
fresh
overall
good
for
a
pils
a
good
american
brewed
pils
not
world
class
though
d
great
pils
ill
be
revisiting
this
one
nicely
drinkable
easily
drinkable
but
not
a
beer
that
stands
out
from
the
crowd
overall
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
it
is
a
great
beer
to
have
around
the
house
for
everyday
drinking
the
average
beer
drinker
like
myself
would
consider
this
a
beer
that
tastes
good
but
it
does
not
blow
your
mind
oh
well
i
guess
my
obsession
with
superdry
north
german
style
pilsners
wont
be
quenched
in
oklahomaunless
eric
marshall
of
marshall
brewing
gets
inspired
by
the
likes
of
troegs
sunshine
victory
prima
or
stoudts
pils
d
extremely
easy
to
drink
when
in
need
of
a
solid
and
easilyaccessible
pilsner
this
is
where
im
going
my
wife
really
enjoyed
this
beer
too
which
it
very
easy
to
say
well
both
be
having
this
again
soon
and
often
as
summer
finally
arrives
recommended
12oz
bottle
thrown
in
as
an
extra
from
largadeer
thanks
this
was
a
nice
clear
golden
yellow
which
did
not
at
all
different
than
any
other
pilsener
the
aroma
was
earthy
minerals
and
exactly
how
i
expected
it
to
smell
the
flavor
was
more
earthiness
and
corn
the
drinkability
was
damn
good
as
my
pilsener
glass
was
quickly
drained
poured
into
a
pint
glass
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
big
white
head
smells
earthy
and
grainy
hay
grass
aromas
nice
lemony
citrus
and
cereal
grain
some
grassy
hoppiness
crisp
semibitter
finish
prickly
carbonation
light
bodied
refreshing
easy
to
drink
a
great
transition
beer
and
easy
to
drink
the
sad
news
is
my
glass
is
empty
the
good
news
is
i
have
2
more
bottles
how
the
heck
did
tayner
know
that
id
flip
a
lid
over
this
one
thanks
again
dana
why
anyone
would
drink
anything
from
bmc
when
this
is
an
option
is
a
mystery
to
me
quite
nice
well
done
pilsner
beer
about
as
good
as
is
imported
and
widely
available
these
days
authentic
pils

in
berkeleypours
a

whiff
of

me
at

with

smoothwith
a
nice
medium
mouthfeel
with
just
enough
carbonation
drinkability
exceptionali
have
been
reluctant
to
get
back
on
the
pils
bandwagonbut
this
beer
forces
one
to
look
at
pils
againbring
me
another
drinkability
above
average
pils
that
i
would
buy
again
definitely
worth
a
try
it
is
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
the
malts
have
a
lot
of
brediness
to
them
which
are
nicely
balanced
by
the
spicy
hop
characters
the
spiciness
lingers
on
pleasantly
after
tasting
this
has
an
excellent
light
to
medlight
body
to
it
perfectly
in
style
it
is
an
excellent
session
beer
perfect
for
warm
weather
one
of
the
best
west
coastmade
pilsners
ive
had
if
not
the
best
we
got
a
picture
of
this
the
other
week
i
dont
think
it
was
worth
14
bucks
i
am
not
saying
it
was
bad
i
thought
it
had
an
different
after
taste
to
it
it
was
the
first
time
i
have
had
it
i
did
not
like
it
not
saying
its
a
bad
beer
is
just
not
for
me
d
better
than
the
average
americanmade
pils
still
lacks
the
amount
of
flavor
i
want
in
a
beer
its
better
than
the
macroproduced
swill
euphemistically
called
pilsner
but
how
big
a
compliment
is
that
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
beer
that
wont
exercise
your
taste
buds
but
doesnt
taste
bad
either
this
is
a
pretty
good
choice
great
nose
clean
finish
solid
session
brew
its
a
fine
easydrinking
pilsener
everything
about
it
shouts
session
time
nice
straw
color
with
a
minimal
head
nice
and
balanced
with
a
slight
more
hop
kick
than
a
german
made
beer
in
this
style
the
only
drawback
is
the
green
bottling
ive
come
across
some
sun
contaminated
ones
that
have
made
me
sad
poured
into
a
cylindrical
trumer
glass
clean
and
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
some
nice
sections
of
lacework
all
the
way
down
and
oh
boy
look
at
all
them
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
in
beaded
streams
aroma
is
a
blend
of
grains
hops
grass
citrus
flavor
is
malted
grains
up
front
spicy
hops
follow
with
a
hint
of
lemon
and
a
dry
finish
nice
balance
of
flavors
and
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
make
this
a
great
choice
overall
very
good
beer
but
drink
it
fresh
or
dont
drink
it
at
all
great
two
finger
head
that
slowly
recedes
to
a
thick
film
of
foam
and
an
even
thicker
ring
around
the
beer
very
bright
pale
straw
color
with
great
bubbling
the
aroma
is
a
sharp
grassy
malt
light
lemony
hops
the
taste
gypsm
dry
malts
along
with
a
hard
yet
subtle
hop
bill
lemony
hops
and
grassy
malts
for
a
dry
earthy
pils
one
of
the
best
tasting
pilsners
ive
ever
had
insanely
drinkable
and
tasty
d
this
is
an
excellent
pilsener
and
an
excellent
beer
try
it
and
buy
a
6
pack
for
the
summertime
by
the
grill
this
is
what
they
should
be
serving
ontap
in
pubs
and
nightclubs
instead
of
heineken
and
becks
a
simple
refreshing
pilsener
that
will
appeal
to
the
masses
while
satisfying
the
connoisseurs
not
cheap
but
worth
the
small
premium
this
is
a
stellar
pilsner
if
you
like
the
style
this
does
not
disappoint
tastes
like
your
ancestors
from
the
old
world
would
make
this
an
average
beer
i
liked
and
would
recommend
it
but
i
would
pass
it
up
for
a
different
beer
dprobably
the
most
drinkable
beer
i
have
had
to
date
i
am
hard
to
please
but
this
one
was
quite
impressive
light
yellow
but
slightly
hazy
with
a
bit
of
bright
white
head
smell
is
of
some
yeast
and
a
light
metallic
smell
probably
from
the
head
carbonation
is
right
on
and
very
crisp
taste
is
of
malt
light
yeasty
doughiness
and
a
touch
of
bitterness
to
finish
finish
is
also
a
bit
drying
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
pilsner
i
wont
be
upset
that
i
cant
get
this
in
my
state
but
could
stand
to
drink
one
again
if
i
came
across
it
this
is
very
similar
to
grolsch
good
beer
goes
down
smooth
i
read
an
article
which
stated
trumer
specifically
chose
berkeley
due
to
the
high
standards
it
sets
for
its
local
water
the
water
does
taste
very
clean
refreshing
helping
to
add
to
the
beers
character
pours
into
my
trumer
pils
glass
a
faded
golden
with
tons
of
carbonation
and
a
beautiful
head
that
rises
above
the
rim
and
stays
there
for
minutes
on
end
lots
of
herbal
and
floral
hops
come
out
at
first
and
i
get
a
lot
of
jasmine
here
with
a
backing
of
sweet
doughy
and
yeasty
malt
like
the
smell
of
a
bakery
early
in
the
morning
before
anything
has
been
baked
this
odd
oversweet
raw
bread
dough
flavor
comes
out
a
bit
much
in
the
flavor
for
my
tastes
hops
back
it
up
well
enough
though
and
add
some
substantial
bitterness
mouthfeel
could
certainly
be
more
effervescent
decent
allaround
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
but
if
i
see
it
at
a
bar
id
surely
buy
one
d
clean
simple
and
tasty
sessionable
as
well
not
a
bad
choice
when
in
a
pinch
an
ok
to
decent
pilsner
its
lacking
skunk
which
is
good
but
its
also
lacking
some
flavor
and
is
a
bit
lighter
in
body
and
taste
than
i
would
like
however
i
think
its
in
general
better
than
some
imports
like
st
pauli
girl
it
comes
off
seeming
a
lot
fresher
unfortunately
however
it
has
a
price
tag
more
like
an
import
making
it
less
attractive
drinkability
for
a
pilsener
i
found
this
brew
very
enjoyable
and
very
much
worth
finishing
the
other
five
from
the
sixpack
go
grab
some
and
give
it
a
try
im
glad
i
did
good
pilsener
a
tremendous
domestic
pilsner
on
par
with
any
ive
tasted
i
was
impressed
with
this
pilsener
i
was
at
a
restaurant
with
not
much
to
chose
from
and
instead
of
going
with
the
typical
fat
tire
or
sam
adams
i
chose
this
and
was
glad
i
did
you
could
drink
a
few
of
these
a
fine
session
beer
good
session
beer
very
light
straw
colored
with
a
thin
persistent
head
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
keeping
it
going
smells
of
hops
and
bananas
with
a
hint
of
skunk
tastes
dry
and
crisp
no
skunk
but
definite
hops
and
a
surprising
hint
of
malt
crisp
finish
if
a
bit
sour
hops
make
a
repeat
appearance
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
bubbly
and
more
substantial
than
the
style
indicates
drinkability
is
very
good
id
say
something
more
clever
but
um
i
got
nothing
to
sum
it
up
i
like
it
poured
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
very
little
head
that
dissapeared
quickly
the
first
aroma
that
hit
me
was
skunkyness
although
the
aroma
did
dissapate
there
was
only
a
little
maltiness
and
noble
hop
aroma
that
could
come
through
the
skunkyness
the
flavor
was
nice
not
the
best
pilsner
flavor
but
there
was
some
bready
maltiness
and
a
little
bit
of
hop
bitterness
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
and
smooth
fairly
light
body
very
refreshing
for
a
hot
day
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
draft
wehre
hopefully
the
skunky
aroma
would
not
be
so
overpowering
but
in
a
bottle
especially
green
bottle
not
my
favorite
pils
allinall
this
beer
was
ok
but
not
especially
commendable
d
chill
it
or
warm
it
to
the
proper
temp
and
this
thing
drinks
like
water
delicious
hop
and
grain
filled
water
smooth
with
good
flavor
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
anytime
you
feel
like
well
having
a
beer
this
has
found
a
semi
permanent
rotation
in
my
fridge
oh
my
this
is
very
drinkable
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
one
setting
i
never
expected
this
beer
to
be
so
good
what
is
up
with
the
green
bottle
lame
im
glad
i
was
able
to
try
a
fresh
nonskunked
bottle
thanks
bill
for
lugging
a
bottle
back
from
ca
i
like
many
good
pilsners
but
this
one
didnt
quite
hit
the
target
for
me
its
a
very
light
gold
brew
the
head
is
minor
but
there
is
good
lace
evidence
the
smell
is
a
musty
bread
the
taste
is
light
and
even
a
little
creamy
with
some
lemon
pepper
notes
reasonably
carbonated
but
it
seemed
to
lose
its
liveliness
quicker
than
i
would
like
pretty
drinkable
as
a
pils
should
be
worth
a
try
but
many
better
choices
for
my
taste
d
well
after
hearing
what
it
tastes
like
go
get
a
six
pack
sit
down
and
enjoy
your
front
porch
and
the
sunshine
and
breeze
you
could
drink
this
all
day
and
well
into
the
night
starting
to
love
more
and
more
pilsners
yummy
poured
this
into
my
official
trumer
pils
glass
aka
the
worlds
biggest
shot
glass
looks
great
pours
a
shiny
gold
with
a
big
creamy
head
that
stays
indefinitely
aroma
is
true
pilsner
hay
grass
and
lemon
all
mixed
together
taste
is
damn
smooth
fresh
lemons
with
a
little
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
an
understated
bite
at
the
end
a
very
tasty
pilsner
and
a
great
session
beer
there
are
others
better
out
there
but
this
beer
can
hold
its
own
a
nice
beer
to
style
now
about
that
green
glass
had
this
on
draft
at
the
grand
hyatt
in
san
francisco
so
assume
that
this
came
from
the
berkeley
ca
brewery
came
a
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
nose
of
light
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
flavors
were
of
light
malts
and
hops
this
indeed
tastes
just
like
an
average
german
pilsener
poured
into
the
cylindrical
trumer
pils
glass
this
beer
is
bright
gold
in
color
with
brilliant
clarity
and
outstanding
head
retention
exceptionally
clean
grassy
and
fresh
prominent
dry
malt
flavors
with
the
perfect
balance
of
bittering
noble
hops
to
back
it
up
very
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
mild
and
dry
finish
that
doesnt
linger
on
the
palate
allaround
very
drinkable
one
of
the
better
american
examples
of
a
pils
and
very
true
to
the
style
d
this
is
a
pretty
descent
pils
it
is
nothing
outstanding
but
certainly
drinkable
12
oz
bottle
color
of
pale
yellow
with
a
frothy
quickly
dissipating
stark
white
head
nose
of
light
hopps
hay
straw
and
crisp

taste
of
hay
hopps
bitter
very
slight
skunk
and
light
fruit
body
is
crisp
light
and
mildly
carbonated

aftertaste
of
hay
and
slight
hopps
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
golden
yellow
color
with
no
head
whatsoever
smells
of
hops
and
yeast
with
some
orangey
citrus
and
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
there
tastes
very
hoppy
and
bitter
more
or
less
balanced
out
by
light
malt
sweetness
some
coppery
flavor
on
the
back
end
the
mouthfeel
is
very
heavy
and
thick
without
much
carbonation
scraping
at
all
but
i
havent
really
noticed
much
carbonation
at
all
all
in
all
its
a
fairly
drinkable
beer
but
i
wouldnt
pay
premium
prices
for
it
glad
i
took
the
chance
this
would
be
too
easy
to
session
on
a
easy
drinking
pils
that
seems
moderate
in
the
abvrange
but
big
on
flavor
pours
a
clear
light
straw
hue
under
a
one
finger
white
head
that
dissipates
a
bit
faster
than
it
should
leaving
film
collar
and
a
few
spots
of
lace
the
nose
is
nice
with
sweet
malt
mingled
with
floral
hops
the
mouth
is
light
and
quite
prickly
good
drinking
brew
here
with
a
fine
sweet
barley
opening
chased
by
a
significant
hops
presence
both
floral
and
coffeesque
the
floral
wins
out
in
the
finish
but
the
dry
espresso
bitter
lurks
halfway
down
the
throat
long
after
the
liquid
is
gone
a
fine
example
of
a
pils
d
this
beer
is
pretty
flavorless
even
when
it
is
not
ice
cold
it
wasnt
very
interesting
with
the
only
many
flavor
being
the
light
punch
of
bitter
noble
hops
taste
nice
pale
malt
flavors
as
well
as
a
decent
hop
flavor
some
mineral
characteristic
a
moderate
bitterness
cleans
up
the
finish
average
decent
beer
but
at
close
to
8
a
six
pack
id
reach
for
something
else
instead
good
to
drink
and
good
to
smell
nice
pilsner
though
the
bitterness
may
be
a
problem
for
some
found
it
a
bit
flat
though
was
expecting
a
more
vibrant
effervescent
mouthfeel
the
bitterness
tended
to
hang
a
bit
heavy
as
a
result
very
pale
in
colour
and
pours
with
a
quickly
disappearing
almost
nonexistent
head
minimal
effervescence
smells
of
hay
and
malt
tastes
of
hay
sweet
malt
and
a
bit
of
bittering
hops
at
the
end
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
didnt
live
up
to
expectations
sheets
of
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
gorgeous
mouthfeel
is
light
but
has
a
dextrinous
character
during
the
brief
bready
sweet
middle
carbonation
is
mild
just
enough
to
help
lift
the
malt
from
the
tastebuds

the
argument
might
be
made
that
theres
nothing
much
to
get
from
this
beer
other
than
a

not
complex

theres
something
to
be
said
for
simplicity

its
done

eye

an
excellent

beer
about
the
only
german
pilsener
ive
tried
this
a
good
beer
not
a
standout
and
certainly
not
worth
the
cost
but
i
could
pound
these
in
the
summer
time
its
ok
pilsner
they
are
trying
to
do
some
things
to
make
it
more
interesting
but
they
clouden
the
picture
trying
to
do
so
the
typical
pilsner
malts
show
nicely
but
seasoned
with
citrusy
hops
that
adds
a
bold
bittering
and
grassy
quality
that
i
quite
liked
the
beer
gets
a
bit
estery
and
biteey
maybe
because
of
higher
temp
fermenting
the
beer
remains
malty
but
thins
in
the
body
throughout
a
light
alcoholic
heat
follows
up
in
the
end
with
a
light
solventlike
flavor
i
rather
enjoyed
the
beer
even
with
a
few
offflavors

a
very
nice
example
of
a
german
style
beer
brewed
here
in

states
the
mouthfeel
is
exactly
like

quite
bubbly
slightly
smooth
but
in
the
end
just
light
enough
to
be
kind
of
refreshing
in
case
there
was
any
doubt
that
an
authentic
german
pilsener
could
be
reproduced
in
the
us
the
trumer
brauerei
has
proven
it
possible
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
to
those
who
enjoy
the
style
as
well
as
to
others
who
would
appreciate
that
authentic

not

this
beer
has
a
sweet
floral
entrance
with
soft
creamy
chewy
carbonation
a
slight

flavor
thats
more
nasal
than
oral
so
does
not
carry
any
sourness
with
it
as
it
moves
back
the
carbonation
thins
out
a
bit
and
the
beer
has
a
strong
bitter
finish
after
swallowing
that
clings
to
the
tongue
and
sides
of
the
mouth
as
a
tart
character
overall
this
beer
is
very
smooth
and
well
balanced

are
enjoyable
the

i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
trumer
pils
usually
i
want
a
rich
filling
stout
or
belgian
but
for
the
times
i
dont
ill
reach
for
this
i
think
this
is
going
to
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
and
for
that
i
give
it
high
marks
overall
impression
this
is
what
a
pilsner
should
be
i
enjoyed
the
first
on
its
own
and
the
second
held
up
very
nicely
to
some
spicy
mexican
food
drinkability
really
surprisingly
nice
looks
like
any
other
pils
out
there
but
the
flavor
is
outstanding
especially
if
you
live
in
the
bay
area
a
fresh
treat
drinkability
this
was
given
to
me
as
a
sample
from
a
beer
rep
who
doesnt
distribute
it
but
thought
i
might
like
it
and
do
i
its
one
of
the
better
pilseners
ive
had
too
bad
it
isnt
readily
available
around
me
i
probably
enjoyed
this
one
even
more
than
it
deserved
nice
clean
crisp
pilsner
style
that
contained
typical
characteristics
as
a
comparsion
point
nice
citrusy
taste
and
smell
with
a
piney
finish
this
was
the
begining
of
a
great
beer
day
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
strawgold
color
with
a
pale
off
white
head
that
is
held
up
by
a
moderate
persistent
carbonation
the
aroma
is
clean
and
spicy
with
a
light
herbal
note
that
is
all
quite
appetizing
the
beer
is
smooth
and
clean
as
it
first
hits
my
mouth
it
is
fairly
dry
with
a
light
toasted
malt
note
though
the
hops
definitely
are
the
major
flavor
contributor
the
beer
is
quite
floral
and
spicy
this
is
definitely
a
nice
example
of
a
dry
german
pils
though
it
has
a
bit
more
fresh
hop
flavor
than
usual
which
is
just
fine
in
my
book
this
is
light
easy
drinking
and
full
of
bright
refreshing
hop
flavors
my
glass
is
empty
and
no
problem
as
a
session
beer
the
wet
straw
taste
is
balanced
well
with
the
pinelime
and
grapefruit
hops
and
the
slightly
metallicastringent
finish
is
balanced
with
smoothness
however
may
not
be
desirable
by
some
pours
a
vibrant
golden
hue
with
a
bright
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
great
carbonation
the
bubbles
dont
stop
aroma
of
slightly
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
dry
hops
and
a
hint
of
clean
lager
yeast
crisp
clean
taste
that
is
good
for
a
german
well
austrian
lager
clean
yeast
a
touch
of
malt
that
isnt
as
sweet
as
on
the
nose
and
a
bit
of
spicy
saaz
hops
that
give
a
touch
of
bitterness
the
tanginess
of
the
hops
provides
a
bit
of
astringency
in
the
mouth
easy
drinking
overall
pretty
nice
a
very
excellent
example
of
a
european
pilsner
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
brewed
here
in
the
usa
so
it
is
fresh
it
is
available
on
draft
and
in
bottles
i
had
the
draft
sadly
the
bottles
are
green
why
do
marketing
people
ruin
good
beer
with
green
bottles
the
draft
is
excellent
i
had
it
served
it
its
own
glass
that
added
to
the
experience
beer
was
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
thick
marangue
head
aroma
was
delicate
saaz
hops
with
a

background
that
was

i
have
ever

still
a

good

a
simply
wonderful
pilsner
that
has
more
to
offer
than
justa
generic

flavor
very
complex
and
pleasing
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
damn
day
for
a
pilsner
this
one
is
very
straight
forward
very
light
and
sweet
smell
and
a
light
and
sweet
taste
i
enjoyed
this
one
refreshing
with
a
great
feel
and
finish
as
with
a
lot
of
pilsners
it
isnt
my
favorite
but
it
is
definitely
on
the
upper
end
on
my
pilsner
list
from
the
u
s
brewery
in
berkeley
not
perfect
but
fun
to
drink
pours
to
a
very
pale
color
think
bud
or
miller
and
creamy
but
thin
head
aroma
is
skunky
ar
first
thanks
to
green
bottle
but
skunk
goes
away
and
allows
the
spicy
noble
hop
aroma
and
malty
notes
to
come
through
flavor
accentuates
the
spicy
traditional
pilsner
hops
balanced
with
sweetvery
clean
malt
dry
crisp
finish
with
lingering
spicy
hoppiness
a
fine
looking
pils
with
absolute
brilliance
nice
carbonation
and
great
head
retention
a
fine
example
of
a
european
pils
even
with
the
skunkiness
unfortunately
if
you
can
get
over
the
pronounced
skunkiness
the
beer
is
well
balanced
with
some
nice
hop
flavor
and
slight
malt
character
i
would
like
to
try
this
on
tap
as
i
think
it
would
be
a
better
sample
without
the
green
bottle
flavor
drinkability
notes
a
pretty
remarkable
german
pilsner
being
that
it
is
brewed
in
the
us
right
up
there
with
the
rest
of
my
favorites
könig
pilsener
organic
ur
pils
or
würzburger
hofbräu
premium
pilsner
get
some
i
tend
to
ignore
the
style
but
being
in
berkeley
means
i
get
this
as
fresh
as
it
comes
if
every
pilsener
tasted
like
this
i
would
drink
a
whole
lot
more
pilsener
poured
a
slightly
hazy
straw
hazy
for
whatever
reason
not
sure
maybe
just
a
chill
haze
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
i
picked
up
some
iron
on
the
nose
as
well
some
herbalgrassy
hops
very
fresh
aroma
appetizing
taste
is
lean
with
hops
dominating
i
think
a
thin
malt
backbone
doesnt
quite
stand
up
to
the
herbal
notes
of
this
beer
a
light
easy
drinker
a
nice
one
to
try
but
pretty
uninspiring
lighter
sweeter
and
less
crisp
than
many
pilsners
uncomplicated
this
beer
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
could
see
myself
drinking
more
of
this
especially
while
summer
sticks
around
as
far
as
the
feel
of
the
beer
it
was
nice
and
smooth
in
my
mouth
it
had
a
good
feel
though
i
do
find
i
like
a
bit
thicker
beer
myself
i
probably
wouldnt
choose
to
drink
this
one
again
myself
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
someone
bought
a
round
of
them
and
i
would
probably
suggest
it
to
anyone
who
does
enjoy
the
taste
of
the
pilsner
beers
all
in
all
probably
my
favorite
pilsner
so
far
even
if
thats
not
saying
a
great
deal
and
id
be
interested
to
hear
any
suggestions
on
good
pilsners
that
people
have
had
drinkability
a
very
inoffensive
and
timid
pilsener
thats
basically
a

just
slightly

not

a
fairly
typical
pils
in
the
czech
style
as
opposed
to
some
variations
that
can
be
found
i
thought
this
was
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
without
too
much
trouble
wasnt
too
impressed
tastes

the
best

a
good
beer
from

a

this
is
one
of
the
better

pilseners
made
in
the
united

i
think
its
super
refreshing
and
bright
but
its
got
a
little
body
too
it
nothing
watery
about
it
at
all
and
has
a
ton
of
flavor
nothing
adjunct
about
it
with
just
a
little
sweetness
in
the
middle
before
the
more
bready

crackery
malts
come
in
fresh
and
sturdy
for
the

hops
are
light
enough
bitter
to
balance
a
higher
sweetness
but
not
real
intense
at
all
some

really
fresh
this
is
fantastic
a
great
beer
with
greasy
food
like

more
than
just
a

cleanser
i
havent
been
the
hugest
fan
of
north

over
the
years
never
really
thought
they
stood
out
much
but
this
one
is
awesome
and
im
not
usually
too
excited
about
pilsener
delicious
different
worth
buying
for
sure
this
may
become
a

for
me

beer

its

that
dont
belong
a

sour
with
funky
vegetables
watery
unpleasant
aftertaste
and
very
reminiscent
of

beers
costing
half
the
price
there
are
so
many
better
pilsners
than
this
the
mild
hop
bitterness
and
malt
sweetness
work
well
together
though
the
latter
is
unexpectedly
prominent
the
body
isnt

light

rather
softly
fizzy
with
just
enough
bite
to
be

overall
ive
tried
four
different
american
brewed
german
pilsners
in
the
last
2
days
and
this
is
by
far
my
favorite
of
the
4
i
honestly
did
not
expect
to
be
nearly
as
amazed
with
this
beer
as
i
am
i
would
even
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
better
german
style
pils
available
even
including
german
brewers
i
am
shocked
by
the
average
review
rating
but
i
think
this
has
a
lot
to
do
with
ba
being
biased
towards
specialty
beers
and
tending
to
overlook
more
subtle
beers
or
not
appreciating
how
difficult
it
is
to
brew
a
beer
to
such
a
high
degree
of
excellence
as
this
delightful
on
a
warm
day
taste
some
barley
and
hops
a
subtle
citrus
and
orangelike
flavor
in
the
background
a
mildly
hoppy
beer
a
good
one
to
introduce
someone
to
what
pilsners
are
all
about
o
very
nice
american
brewed
german
pilsner
its
easy
to
drink
and
ended
up
being
a
crowd
pleaser
id
get
it
again
for
that
reason
im
hoping
this
was
an
old
bottle
no
date
the
flavor
was
bready
and
malty
with
very
little
of
the
crisp
hoppy
bite
i
look
for
in
a
pils
im
being
generous
with
a
3
4
just
because
i
do
think
this
bottle
was
well
past
its
prime
ill
have
this
again
when
i
see
it
on
draft
to
see
if
my
suspicion
is
correct

white
head
the
smell
is
nice
with
some
grains
and
malts
there
is
nothing
over
powering
so
far
the
taste
is
nice
with
some
malts
and
grains
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
clean
scrimshaw
pilsner
has
a
smooth
finish
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
4
out
5
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
o
good
but
not
great
i
like
others
better
in
the
german
pilsner
category
more
and
like
all
czech
pilsners
more
i
would
buy
a
six
pack
of
it
though
o
very
drinkable
pilsener
especially
at
4
4
could
be
a
session
champ
taste
clean
and
crisp
with
a
slightly
moldy
or
cheesy
finish
that
sounds
weird
but
i
dont
meant
it
to
be
offputting
it
is
quite
good
nice
mild
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
o
awesome
session
ale
tasty
and
easy
at
the
same
time
this
is
my
first
beer
from
north
coast
served
from
a
12
oz
bottle
pours
a
light
to
medium
gold
with
a
decent
head
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
hops
are
very
noticeable
in
the
aroma
but
there
is
a
lack
of
malty
or
grainy
notes
taste
is
good
with
hops
out
in
front
again
i
would
have
preferred
more
of
a
grainy
dryness
here
as
i
think
its
more
consistent
with
the
style
mouthfeel
is
decent
if
a
bit
thinner
than
i
would
have
liked
carbonation
is
significant
and
nicely
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
decent
warm
weather
beer
and
while
i
would
certainly
drink
it
again
if
offered
its
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
my
hands
on
o
proof
that
beers
dont
have
to
be
complex
to
be
very
good

poured
a
deep
very
slightly
cloudy
gold
with
a
thick
foamier
white
head
the
head
has
minor
retention
and
leaves
a
smidgen
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
good
with
notes
of
a
nice
biscuit
and
fresh
grass
nature
the
taste
has
similar
components
with
just
a
light
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
finish
there
is
a
nice
crispness
to
the
finish
and
good
thin
weight
to
the
body
very
good
certainly
wow
just
keep
coming
back
to
this
one
poured
into
a
shorty
has
a
lively
pumpkin
glow
inviting
for
sure
but
what
really
makes
it
special
is
the
citrus
aroma
its
outstanding
with
every
sip
or
gulp
non
of
the
mustyness
that
comes
with
many
pills
and
the
taste
is
exceptional
scrimshaw
takes
you
on
a
nice
bright
flavor
ride
before
pulling
back
to
a
clean
satisfying
finish
could
drink
this
one
all
the
time
wait
i
do
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
one
clean
drinking
and
tasting
pilsner
minimal
lacing
clear
golden
color
and
barley
aroma
just
like
a
pilsner
should
be
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
carbonation
was
a
little
on
the
fizzy
side
but
did
not
detract
from
the
experience
overall
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
pilsner
its
perhaps
not
as
crisp
as
id
like
but
that
is
a
bit
more
instyle
to
a
german
pils
rather
than
a
czech
one
overall
best
pilsner
ive
had
up
to
this
point
excellent
session
beer
tasty
and
refreshing
especially
in
a
warm
summer
evening
very
well
priced
as
well
overall
bordering
more
on
hellesczech
pilsner
territory
than
german
pilsner
more
bready
and
floral
than
sharp
and
earthy
listed
as

easy
drinking
and
golden
color
and
wont
leave
you
destroyed
after
a
few
has
a
nice
finish
but
it
leaves
quickly
o
perhaps
my
current
favorite
definitely
in
my
top
3
i
love
this
and
consider
it
a
great
representation
of
the
style
the
low
abv
is
also
quite
a
plus
to
me
perfect
summer
brew
i
would
drink
these
all
the
time
if
they
werent
so
damned
expensive
116
poured
from
the
12
oz
bottle
into
a
flute
this
is
a
deep
golden
yellow
beer
nearly
light
orange
with
a
creamy
white
head
resembling
whipped
cream
that
settles
down
quite
quickly
aroma
is
classic
white
breadlike
pale
malts
predominantly
with
a
subdued
stronger
cereal
note
and
noble
hops
notes
slightly
floral
and
fruity
the
cereals
are
stronger
on
the
palate
and
truth
be
told
this
is
one
of
the
best
german
pilseners
ive
had
from
a
malt
standpoint
there
is
a
rich
and
sweet
caramellike
maltiness
along
with
the
more
expected
cracker
and
sourdough
bread
notes
there
must
be
a
decent
dose
of
crystal
in
this
and
the
hop
flavors
are
really
popping
out
as
well
i
am
getting
some
tangerine
and
orange
in
here
unripe
stone
fruit
galore
faint
brown
spice
grass
and
fragrant
hay
the
citrus
is
quite
prominent
in
the
finish
body
is
thin
as
per
the
style
but
with
a
shade
more
chew
than
massproduced
adjunct
lagers
and
the
carbonation
is
pleasingly
toned
down
but
still
robust
enough
to
remind
you
that
you
are
drinking
a
pils
finishes
fruity
yet
dry
and
a
little
chalky
with
a
massive
citric
presence
that
lingers
absolutely
brilliant
stuff
the
green
malts
provide
most
of
the
heft
but
the
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
keeps
up
admirably
pours
a
hazy
gold
in
color
with
a
good
almost
2finger
head
that
settled
down
to
a
think
layer
on
top
and
sides
of
the
glass
a
great
deal
of
lacing
is
seen
like
most
german
pilsners
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
just
grass
and
fresh
bread
the
taste
is
well
fantastic
not
overly
complicated
at
all
for
the
taste
very
refreshing
and
goes
down
easy
with
no
bitter
or
harsh
aftertaste
at
all
very
surprised
as
i
wasnt
sure
of
how
this
one
would
be
overall
but
very
pleased
o
not
my
favorite
but
certainly
drinkable
a
very
good
beer
no
doubt
overall
a
beer
that
has
little
to
complain
about
if
god
himself
were
to
drink
a
beer
it
would
be
this
one
it
has
the
light
drinkable
texture
all
of
the
alcohol
content
and
no
nasty
aftertaste
i
can
drink
this
while
i
eat
dinner
or
i
can
come
in
after
mowing
my
grass
and
this
beer
is
absolutely
amazing
i
have
had
it
semi
warm
and
ice
cold
of
course
ice
cold
is
the
best
the
one
thing
that
i
truly
admire
about
this
beers
flavor
is
that
is
goes
great
with
any
food
you
make
i
truly
love
it
best
with
a
big
plate
of
fried
cod
fried
chips
and
hush
puppies
this
one
is
a
great
session
beer
that
i
will
return
to
eric
for
the
style
this
beer
is
amazing
north
coast
rules
acme
pale
and
old
ras
are
very
good
as
well
i
am
the
beer
manager
at
a
store
located
in
md
and
i
recommend
this
beer
all
the
time
for
anyone
who
drinks
any
style
of
beer
surely
a
favorite
to
many
o
nice
pilsner
o
nice
could
use
a
bit
more
character
but
overall
very
enjoyable
good
pilsner
it
just
lacked
a
bit
more
bittering
hops
overall
im
partial
to
czech
pilsners
and
this
one
is
very
much
more
german
in
style
it
is
good
but
just
very
safe
drinkable
thats
for
sure
overall
an
ok
session
beer
maybe
on
a
summer
afternoon
but
not
one
to
run
back
to
any
time
soon
this
is
a
welcoming
beer
to
my
winterweary
taste
buds
i
love
the
pilsner
style
of
beer
and
this
one
is
just
right
in
the
hops
and
malt
department
for
me
it
pours
beautifully
a
light
amber
with
a
thick
head
and
lingering
laciness
smells
of
summer
to
me
taste
is
crisp
with
just
the
right
balance
mouthfeel
is
lightmedium
and
leaves
the
palate
dry
and
refreshed
i
could
enjoy
this
one
on
the
deck
this
summer
with
a
grilled
burger
and
potato
salad
or
right
now
with
a
tasty
reuben
sandwich
and
chips
sooo
much
better
than
the
massproduced
pilsners
being
offered
in
the
u
s
these
days
ill
be
back
for
more
pouring
a
rich
112
inch

topping

color
is
bright
warm
as
yellow
innocence
mission
in
my
weizen
glass
the
lemon
note
hit
me
right
away
comfort
of
herb
telling
sugary
sweetness
to
take
a
hike
mouthfeel
didnt
notice
the
lack
of
carbonations
persistence
as
it
was
savoring
this
evocation
of
summer
in
denial
of
todays
winter
chill
i
find
myself
reaching
for
peanuts
at
the
ball
game
or
something
salty
herbal
lingering
on
the
palate
and
a
dry
finish
put
me
in
coach
im
ready
to
play

a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
i
like
this
pilsner
and
would
love
to
introduce
it
to
people
that
drink
budweiser
and
the
like
perhaps
they
could
understand
that
there
is
better
beer
out
there
to
be
had
besides
the
big
names
and
this
one
works
for
just
that
cheers
this
was
nice
a
nice
pilsener
not
100
true
to
its
style
but
its
normal
considering
its
an
american
craft
beer
a
great
adaptation
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
pairs
well
with
most
foods
i
enjoyed
it
with
some
tapas
personally
and
it
matched
well
with
many
different
flavors
in
the
dishes
the
beer
has
a
very
low
abv
and
is
quite
sessionable
flavor
mild
thicker
than
it
appears
has
a
light
beer
taste
with
average
flavors
the
feel
is
right
this
beer
is
lightbodied
without
lacking
depth
or
being
too
thin
its
got
a
steady
even
crispness
the
whole
way
through
and
a
light
creamy
smoothness
accompanying
it
well
overall
drinkability
a
great
pilsner
i
might
not
know
this
was
a
pilsner
if
i
were
blindfolded
the
mineral
character
is
slightly
offputting
overalla
fairly
refreshing
brew
that
could
benefit
from
less
bready
malt
character
and
no
diacetyl
a
decent
german
style
pilsner
nothing
unpleasant
nor
anything
memorable
the
malts
seemed
a
bit
different
than
a
typical
pilsner
the
taste
is
much
like
the
nose
with
a
slightly
sweet
and
malty
character
maybe
i
have
not
had
enough
german
pilsners
and
while
i
enjoyed
it
for
what
it
was
i
thought
it
seemed
a
bit
unusual
for
the
style
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
adding
your
own
touch
to
a
brew
there
are
more
enjoyable
craft
german
pilseners
but
scrimshaw
is
respectable
and
drinkable
a
solid
choice
for
a
summery
lager
sixpack
o
this
is
not
the
most
textbook
example
of
the
style
but
it
isnt
bad
sits
just
a
little
bit
heavier
on
the
palate
than
most
pilsners
the
pilsner
quality
is
found
in
the
taste
as
a
sweet
barley
malt
roasted
kiln
grain
and
tea
leaf
flavor
comes
out
very
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
as
advertised
nothing
complex
but
simply
a
quality
tasting
refresher
oa
refreshing
pilsener
but
it
doesnt
bring
much
to
the
tabe
the
verdict
very
good
a
complex
but
well
rounded
pils
that
goes
down
smooth
a
great
summer
time
session
beer
overall
very
happy
i
came
across
this
beer
very
nice
flavor
and
refreshing
my
new
favorite
pilsner
overall
its
an
ok
representation
of
a
style
that
i
enjoy
on
summer
days
o
solid
there
are
few
other
pilsners
id
go
for
over
this
one
but
id
pick
this
over
many
others
too
overall
excellent
pilsner
this
is
my
2nd
6
pack
and
couldnt
wait
to
pick
it
up
it
is
a
very
balanced
beer
light
and
easy
to
drink
i
was
a
bigger
fan
of
kolsch
beers
but
this
pilsner
has
made
me
reevaluate
my
own
palate
practically
a
perfect
beer
for
me
and
for
my
everyday
drinking
this
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
impressive
head
retention
theres
an
aroma
of
a
light
grassy
lemony
note
some
mild
cornflake
contrasted
with
lemon
zest
it
tastes
softly
crisp
with
a
subdued
sweetness
a
touch
of
grass
a
great
effervescence
much
better
than
the
one
i
had
on
tap
not
too
long
ago
its
light
easy
drinking
priced
right
for
repeat
visits
more
carbonation
is
needed
pretty
low
at
the
moment
overall
a
tasty
and
certainly
serviceable
pils
i
got
this
scrimshaw
in
my
beer
club
this
month
and
its
a
good
example
of
why
i
do
the
beer
club
bc
i
might
over
look
this
beer
in
the
store
its
a
good
beer
looks
clear
and
golden
nice
color
and
head
it
smells
about
like
what
you
would
expect
a
pilsner
to
smell
but
i
really
thing
it
has
a
good
balance
of
drinkability
and
flavor
its
a
really
solid
beer
you
could
drink
on
any
occasion

overall
this
is
a
nice
pilsener
definitely
not
as
dry
as
most
i
have
had
but
has
a
nice
balance
of
fairly
unique
flavors
and
is
very
smooth
to
drink
a
nicely
enjoyable
offering
my
rating
is
based
on
my
impressions
before
having
any
food
with
it
o
extremely
enjoyable
beer
great
for
your
game
day
drinking
this
is
a
good
beer
for
me
as
im
not
much
of
a
beer
watever
im
not
going
to
bore
anyone
with
details
but
other
than
i
like
it
and
one
best
beers
i
had
in
while
not
sure
ft
bragg
has
anything
to
do
with
it
but
i
am
a
vet
good
job
with
the
beer
scrimshaw
yellow
with
white
sheet
of
fine
foam
smells
of
grain
light
herbal
hops
and
some
light
white
grapes
taste
is
nice
and
inline
with
the
style
grainy
with
straw
and
noble
hop
character
light
bodied
with
low
carb
and
a
wet
finish
nice
enough
notes
top
to
bottom
this
is
a
remarkable
pilsner
a
nice
dry
finish
and
very
sessionable
cheers
solid
and
excellently
made
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
grains
are
present
taste
is
crisp
sweet
grains
and
hops
very
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
solid
beer
overall
this
is
a
very
easy
drinker
as
you
would
expect
from
the
style
i
will
probably
pick
up
more
of
this
in
the
summer
for
my
barbeques
overall
great
german
style
pilsner
flavors
are
fairly
simple
but
pronounced
and
present
a
dual
layered
experience
really
easy
to
drink
sessionable
overall
not
bad
too
weak
and
watery
for
me
very
easy
to
drink
just
a
little
too
light
on
the
hops
and
malts
i
can
see
were
alot
of
people
would
like
this
as
i
do
to
but
just
way
to
may
better
pils
out
there
its
still
worth
a
drink
overall
eh
decent
not
much
of
a
fan
of
pils
but
i
can
see
how
a
few
of
these
could
be
easily
absorbed
over
a
good
conversation
still
prefer
a
bit
more
of
an
abv
but
i
guess
this
is
typical
of
the
style
i
can
do
a
few
of
these
heck
im
a
sucker
for
anything
thats
seriously
crafted
i
gotta
give
it
a
4
5
overall
i
do
like
it
not
much
in
the
way
of
aroma
but
this
doesnt
reflect
the
taste
which
is
moderately
floral
fresh
and
slightly
salty
very
satisfying
the
mouth
feel
is
perfect
for
style
not
too
thick
or
thin
not
much
head
but
this
could
have
been
the
fault
of
the
pourer
id
drink
this
again
i
drank
this
beer
out
of
my
arrogant
bastard
pint
class
i
have
very
little
experience
with
pilsners
and
it
happened
to
be
my
last
beer
in
my
custom
made
6
pack
i
was
not
expecting
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
however
i
was
blown
away
taste
is
hard
to
explain
but
the
easiest
way
to
explain
how
this
beer
tasted
was
clean
and
to
the
point
was
brewed
like
an
authentic
german
pilsner
using
the
german
purity
law
and
it
tasted
like
it
tasted
like
it
was
brewed
with
real
spring
water
light
caramel
finish
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
the
absolutely
only
thing
that
i
would
saw
for
me
was
that
the
carbonation
was
just
a
tad
overwhelming
outstanding
beer
a
coudos
to
north
coast
brewing
company
north
coast
local
and
loyal
drinker
forever
thanks
to
fantastic
beers
like
this
one
overall
a
good
pilsner
overall
and
this
one
packs
a
good
amount
of
flavor
very
good
pilsner
complex
yet
balanced
flavorful
and
easy
to
drink
served
in
a
pint
glass
straw
colored
with
half
finger
of
head
normal
pilsener
stuff
had
a
honey
smell
to
it
and
some
dry
grain
spicy
taste
wet
bitterness
and
clean
crisp
and
light
body
with
moderate
carbonation
a
great
pils
that
had
a
bigger
body
and
flavor
than
most
other
pils
im
a
bartender
at
a
very
popular
tap
room
in
durham
nc
this
beer
is
one
of
my
ace
in
the
holes
i
often
encounter
patrons
that
are
new
to
craft
beer
and
need
guidance
we
dont
sell
anheuser
busch
products
which
alarms
some
guests
but
north
coast
scrimshaw
pilsner
allows
me
to
engage
guests
and
challenge
their
tastes
scrimshaw
pours
a
bright
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
white
head
leaving
some
nice
lacing
behind
tiny
bubbles
come
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
scent
is
malty
with
some
spicy
floral
hops
flavor
is
light
peppery
lemony
with
some
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
oily
with
medium
carbonation
a
dry
finish
and
a
slight
lemon
aftertaste
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
pilsner
very
sessionable
and
perfect
for
summertime
activites
that
require
a
low
abv
beer
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
guy
cheers
m
light
with
moderate
carbonation
a
really
nice
sessionable
brew
best
pilsner
ive
had
alongside
czechvar
overall
a
decent
lighter
lager
has
some
nice
biscuit
flavor
and
hop
spice
edit
just
reading
at
the
n
coast
web
site
that
this
beer
has
won
medals
in
the
category
american
lager
ale
while
im
not
sure
of
the
bas
definition
if
its
anything
close
to
a
kölsch
and
nc
had
labeled
this
beer
as
such
id
have
given
it
higher
marks
overall
a
strong
choice
for
a
summer
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
everything
was
done
well
with
this
beer
except
the
taste
just
wasnt
anything
to
scream
about
i
think
i
would
have
this
again
i
was
excited
to
try
this
beer
got
it
whole
foods
tonight
honestly
i
am
a
bit
disappointed
as
this
doesnt
stand
out
much
from
a
macro
pils
to
me
part
of
it
is
that
i
am
not
a
huge
pils
fan
to
begin
with
but
when
reviewing
it
objectively
i
would
not
prefer
this
much
over
a
pbr
it
has
a
bit
of
a
bitter
taste
to
it
the
smell
is
pretty
good
not
skunky
this
mouthfeel
is
generally
smooth
and
not
a
turn
off
overall
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
and
i
could
throw
a
few
back
and
enjoy
but
it
is
clearly
average
in
my
opinion
o
seems
a
bit
more
pale
lager
than
pilsener
but
none
the
less
good
drinking
went
great
with
the
sf
oysters
and
little
neck
chowder
low
b
this
is
a
good
clean
crisp
lager
it
is
simple
as
a
lager
should
be
and
it
was
decent
priced
at
8
49
bevmo
in
los
angeles
area
which
is
the
going
rate
low
end
for
a
craft
6
pack
i
find
my
self
spending
30
bucks
on
a
12pack
these
days
i
am
searching
for
the
perfect
lager
and
so
far
peroni
yes
peroni
is
the
closest
ive
gotten
oa
refreshing
pilsener
with
good
flavor
on
tap
at
la
sirena
in
south
laguna
beach
it
was
6
for
15
oz
pour
at
least
theyre
honest
about
their
pint
glasses
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
hazy
golden
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
leaving
minimal
lacing
around
the
sides
of
the
glass
aromas
of
lightly
toasted
malt
and
grassy
hops
its
the
sort
of
smell
youd
expect
from
this
style
the
flavor
is
slightly
sweet
and
bready
theres
a
mild
citrus
flavor
and
the
hops
come
in
on
the
back
end
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
yet
also
crisp
and
dry
the
carbonation
is
appropriate
and
not
overpowering
making
this
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
pils
i
would
recommend
this
one
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
medium
orange
amber
thin
white
head
dissipates
to
a
ring
no
lacing
moderate
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
bready
yeast
light
taste
of
sweet
and
caramel
malt
light
fruit
somewhat
dry
but
sweet
finish
subdued
flavors
but
well
balanced
and
what
flavor
is
there
is
pleasant
a
good
low
abv
standby
o
damnit
if
i
didnt
get
a
kick
out
of
north
coasts
scrimshaw
pilsner
this
is
easily
one
of
the
better
german
style
pilsners
being
brewed
in
america
make
that
anywhere
and
with
such
a
low
abv
its
great
to
find
such
flavor
without
having
to
wreck
myself
with
too
much
booze
a
big
thumbs
up
from
me
heartily
recommended
and
something
i
eagerly
look
forward
to
getting
into
many
times
again
taste
is
fairly
average
with
the
barley
coming
through
pretty
quickly
and
a
light
citrus
tingle
in
the
finish
its
subtle
though
not
bad
but
i
cant
say
id
return
to
this
one
anytime
soon
either
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
although
this
comes
from
a
guy
who
generally
prefers
porters
and
ipa
this
pilsner
is
fresh
clean
and
tasty
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
i
think
it
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
this
is
a
light
and
very
refreshing
beer
its
to
style
and
its
sessionable
and
for
the
style
its
full
of
flavor
i
would
have
this
again
o
good
grass
mowing
beer
but
needs
more
hops
if
i
was
really
picky
i
would
say
the
beer
could
be
a
tad
more
carbonated
other
than
that
this
is
the
best
pilsner
i
have
had
to
date
very
tasty
nice
clean
hop
taste
that
doesnt
overpower
the
malt
flavor
nice
golden
color
with
tiny
bubbles
great
taste
goes
down
incredibly
smooth
pours
out
a
sunny
straw
yellow
lightly
hazed
one
finger
of
head
no
lacing
left
behind
smells
like
a
ginseng
green
sweet
tea
for
some
reason
actually
it
is
probably
a
combination
of
herbal
hopping
with
a
saazlike
ginseng
spiciness
also
i
can
detect
the
aroma
of
a
honeyed
pale
malt
underneath
that
everything
present
in
the
nose
also
shows
up
in
the
flavor
but
there
is
also
a
lot
of
floral
and
white
bread
elements
that
i
wasnt
able
to
smell
body
is
on
the
light
side
of
medium
thick
and
sufficiently
carbonated
for
the
flavors
within
this
one
is
a
really
tasty
german
pilsner
overall
another
well
made
pilsner
that
i
really
enjoy
well
worth
looking
for
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
classic
pilsner
soft
and
subtle
in
character
yet
completely
hitting
the
mark
in
the
style
o
overall
i
like
this
beer
its
not
over
carbonated
or
sweet
and
its
very
drinkable
to
me
theres
not
really
anything
i
can
say
bad
about
it
although
i
probably
would
prefer
a
prima
pils
over
this
id
buy
this
again
though
pretty
tasty
cheers
overall
theres
a
lack
of
bittering
and
flavoring
hops
when
it
comes
to
my
ideal
pilsner
the
carbonation
could
be
toned
down
a
bit
too
an
ok
beer
at
best
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
as
usual
with
north
coast
hidden
freshness
date
this
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
smell
is
a
nice
crisp
pilsner
grass
hops
malts
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
the
taste
is
some
of
the
same
nice
and
crisp
a
fine
pilsner
overall
a
solid
pilsner
quite
nice
its
been
a
little
warm
today
so
i
am
enjoying
this
one
feels
right
this
is
a
good
clean
thirst
quenching
beer
i
would
have
liked
a
touch
more
bitterness
and
a
little
less
sweetness
but
i
would
seek
it
out
again
o
would
have
liked
a
bit
more
hop
balance
but
overall
a
very
refreshing
satisfying
beer
worth
a
try
for
pilsner
fans
o
this
is
a
beer
that
reminds
me
of
a
macro
north
coast
makes
some
great
brews
but
this
is
something
that
could
be
passed
on
the
beer
had
a
light
feel
to
it
but
the
beer
was
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
the
low
abv
was
also
a
plus
for
me
as
i
could
enjoy
a
couple
and
it
not
really
affect
me
overall
poured
nicely
with
a
large
head
with
minimal
aroma
smooth
light
taste
a
quick
finish
with
little
after
taste
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
nothing
like
a
new
bliss
tasting
to
show
you
how
many
everyday
beers
you
havent
tried
before
this
caseinpoint
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
wet
hay
grass
and
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
light
twinge
of
lemon
zest
near
the
edges
and
finish
not
bad
the
body
is
fairly
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
very
nice
pilsner
one
of
the
best
american
versions
ive
had
in
a
while
right
on
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
large
three
finger
wide
fluffy
pillowy
white
head
retention
on
the
head
is
impressive
and
there
is
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
of
delicate
hops
faint
yeast
subtle
malt
lemon
citrus
and
various
grains
faint
grasses
and
hay
also
make
their
way
through
taste
is
of
lemon
straw
hay
faint
malt
a
touch
of
hops
and
some
scattered
grain
and
floral
notes
mouthfeel
is
crisp
amply
carbonated
and
finishes
cleanly
overall
a
good
easydrinking
pilsener
that
ive
found
myself
hooked
on
lately
especially
when
i
cant
decide
on
anything
else
to
drink
overall
nice
smooth
light
malt
taste
very
easy
drinking
the
pilsner
malts
by
themselves
do
not
overpower
the
rest
of
the
flavor
nice
balance
of
corn
and
lighter
malts
super
easy
to
drink
would
make
a
great
summer
beer
quite
good
and
hoppy
used
to
drink
it
in
chapel
hill
at
university
high
carbonation
with
a
dry
after
taste
has
a
good
nostalgia
feeling
for
me
and
would
happily
drink
again
if
available
never
really
noticed
the
smell
always
drank
straight
from
the
bottle
was
well
worth
it
in
nc
as
it
did
not
have
to
travel
far
pours
a
small
hazy
orangeish
to
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
malt
and
small
hop
in
the
taste
sweet
maltiness
note
of
caramel
and
a
small
floral
hop
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
and
a
small
dry
floral
hop
in
the
aftertaste
sweeter
and
more
floral
that
expected
almost
ale
like
yeah
finding
this
slightly
deficient
mostly
in
the
pilsener
stakes
the
hop
character
is
just
not
assertive
enough
and
as
a
result
a
weird
adjuncty
grain
note
comes
through
instead
o
decent
pilsner
much
better
than
anything
from
bmc
3
5
d
this
beer
would
be
really
easy
to
pound
one
after
another
its
super
clean
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
downside
is
that
there
isnt
much
going
on
o
not
bad
kinda
boring
easy
to
drink
not
much
going
on
like
i
said
drinkable
o
this
was
a
pleasure
i
had
a
tough
time
finding
this
beer
for
some
reason
and
it
was
well
worth
the
wait
great
pils
north
coast
overall
very
good
beer
very
drinkable
it
balances
the
flavors
well
and
doesnt
leave
a
bitter
aftertaste
good
all
around
beer
o
very
refreshing
beer
rjt
overall
impression
a
very
typical
pilsner
but
with
an
awesome
aroma
very
clean
refreshing
and
finishes
crisp
ive
had
many
times
and
will
again
when
im
in
the
mood
another
good
one
from
north
coast
brewing
co
o
an
enjoyable
pilsner
whos
to
say
if
this
was
old
or
fresh
due
to
lack
of
bottling
date
still
overall
drinkability
greatness
for
the
style
best
pilsner
ive
had
that
being
said
still
refreshing
and
tasty
o
definitely
a
good
pilsner
for
what
it
is
pours
a
clear
dark
gold
color
with
a
12
inch
offwhite
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
stick
to
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
biscuitlike
malt
earthyherbal
hops
and
a
bit
of
an
off
funky
aroma
taste
is
better
with
grainybiscuitlike
malt
and
some
herbal
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
this
beer
has
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
with
a
bubbly
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
the
funky
aroma
i
picked
up
in
the
smell
knocks
the
score
down
a
bit
this
is
a
good
crisp
beer
it
pours
as
i
would
expect
straw
color
loose
head
it
smells
like
dried
fruit
and
hops
the
taste
is
all
dried
apricot
while
this
is
not
bad
it
is
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
i
am
not
sure
i
would
drink
this
one
too
much
the
mouthfeel
is
perfect
for
a
lager
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
clean
finish
overall
this
was
a
good
change
of
pace
i
dont
drink
pilseners
routinely
so
it
was
nice
to
enjoy
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
beer
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
a
lot
more
than
i
expected
i
would
north
coast
is
definitely
an
underrated
brewery
scrimshaw
pilsner
is
a
really
nice
session
lager
which
could
really
challenge
the
top
tier
with
a
little
less
residual
sweetness
great
beer
nontheless
o
its
crisp
and
drinkable
but
isnt
the
most
flavorful
pilsner
clear
light
amber
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
left
rings
of
sticky
lace
all
the
way
down
visibly
carbonated
a
blizzard
of
bubbles
rush
up
from
the
bottom
smells
like
clean
malts
and
not
much
else
taste
is
better
as
a
floral
bouquet
of
hops
start
to
come
through
buttery
diacetyl
is
quite
refreshing
a
wellmade
american
pils
its
saturday
afternoon
just
got
done
with
my
responsibilities
for
the
day
and
it
is
time
to
start
relaxing
the
first
beer
today
is
a
north
coast
scrimshaw
and
it
was
a
great
lead
off
the
appeance
is
great
for
a
pilsner
golden
clear
great
carbonation
thin
white
head
that
is
lacing
the
smell
is
typical
of
most
pilsners
but
seems
much
fresher
there
is
malt
hop
grain
the
taste
is
very
easy
for
a
pilsner
and
quite
good
probably
the
best
pils
i
have
had
in
a
while
and
possibly
ever
the
mouthfeel
is
smoot
like
butter
and
very
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
light
well
carbonated
and
easy
to
drink
overall
it
was
a
nice
pilsner
that
went
down
easy
and
id
certainly
try
it
again
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
to
it
partly
due
to
the
hops
partly
the
carbonation
this
helps
it
stand
out
above
the
pack
of
pilseners
i
love
pilseners
so
it
doesnt
necessarily
have
to
stand
out
to
please
me
that
being
said
it
doesnt
go
down
nearly
as
smooth
as
other
pilseners
part
of
the
reason
i
love
them
so
i
dont
always
go
for
this
one
but
it
is
a
good
beer
and
worth
trying
overall
its
drinkable
and
really
isnt
that
bad
in
fact
it
really
is
a
good
beer
but
doesnt
stand
up
to
the
brewery
discription
or
style
in
general
for
me
the
thin
smooth
soft
flavor
and
feel
are
the
sticking
points
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
hue
which
leaves
a
fluffy
two
finger
head
and
sporadic
clingy
lacingthe
smell
is
fresh
cut
grasslemon
zest
and
a
touch
of
caramelthe
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
silky
smooth
with
perfect
carbonation
and
has
tastes
of
floral
hopslemonlime
zestwhite
grapesa
touch
of
candy
and
finished
with
a
crisp
dry
grassy
hop
finish
and
overall
better
than
most
macroswill
but
there
is
better
versions
of
this
style
out
there
and
i
would
not
revisit
anytime
soon
cheers
d
an
easy
drinker
with
some
flavour
o
pretty
average
nothing
special
by
any
means
needs
more
noble
hop
flavor
just
an
okay
pilsner
in
my
opining
for
sure
a
big
disappointment
overall
seriously
im
yet
to
cross
a
beer
brewed
by
north
coast
that
isnt
worth
my
money
even
though
im
a
bigger
fan
of
ales
this
beer
contains
the
nice
light
funkiness
of
lagers
and
the
thick
malty
body
of
ales
as
a
session
brew
its
crowd
pleaser
for
sure
yet
a
slightly
complex
beer
that
beer
geeks
can
enjoy
as
well
an
interesting
pils
thats
for
sure
continental
influence
nocal
edge
in
the
end
the
crispness
factor
keeps
this
offering
afloat
rendering
an
enjoyable
and
flavourful
lager
a
nice
changeup
from
all
the
heady
ipas
that
i
acquired
along
with
this
on
that
trip
stateside
o
super
easy
to
drink
and
really
refreshing
and
clean
i
would
definitely
get
thing
again
overall
a
decent
malt
leaning
pilsner
it
would
be
more
enjoyable
with
a
stronger
hop
presence
but
its
not
bad
by
any
means
scrimshaw
pilsner
is
nothing
at
all
like
most
bastardized
american
examples
youll
find
in
the
corner
store
fridge
but
despite
its
clean
confident
wholesome
maltiness
its
not
quite
on
the
same
level
as
the
best
micro
and
especially
german
examples
either
still
if
youre
not
picky
and
just
looking
for
a
simple
easy
drinking
beer
this
will
do
you
no
wrong
t
bready
malts
yeast
and
a
very
slight
touch
of
hops
the
hops
were
a
little
too
faint
for
me
i
feel
like
maybe
this
wasnt
the
freshest
bottle
id
like
to
try
this
again
a
bit
more
fresh
o
really
great
pilsner
one
of
the
best
ive
had
a
nice
drinker
that
i
will
look
for
later
mouthfeel
this
one
comes
across
rich
and
almost
creamy
with
a
crisp
clean
and
light
body
that
doesnt
compromise
flavor
a
definite
recommendation
is
presented
here
m
the
best
part
of
this
beer
mouth
coating
is
nice
with
crisp
taste
not
overpowering
with
carbonation
the
finish
is
great
dry
finish
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
1
finger
clean
white
head
the
beer
settles
a
nice
transparent
and
lightly
bubbly
look
the
aroma
is
very
mild
but
crisp
there
are
some
slight
hints
of
malt
alone
with
a
bready
note
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
crisp
there
is
a
good
malt
front
with
a
very
faint
bitter
hop
finish
there
is
also
a
dryness
to
the
after
taste
but
at
the
abv
not
likely
from
alcohol
content
this
is
a
very
well
made
and
balanced
brew
nothing
over
powering
but
that
is
what
the
style
calls
for
and
this
is
a
good
example
so
easy
to
drink
settling
on
the
tongue
and
beyond
highly
sessionable
given
the
abv
o
this
beer
is
ok
it
is
by
no
means
bad
i
just
did
not
find
it
to
be
my
personal
favorite
i
thought
the
grassyness
was
too
strong
and
there
were
not
enough
complexities
to
the
beer
i
will
probably
be
sticking
to
other
pilsners
nice
light
feel
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
great
pilsner
real
good
for
summer
overall
this
delivers
a
nice
refreshing
beer
that
is
true
to
style
and
complex
as
well
one
regret
i
have
is
passing
this
up
on
tap
while
in
hawaii
a
month
or
so
ago
good
beer
o
a
decent
pils
but
not
one
i
would
choose
overall
i
am
a
person
who
prefers
malts
to
hops
and
this
is
one
of
the
maltier
pilseners
i
have
had
in
a
while
with
the
low
abv
i
could
session
this
i
am
glad
i
bought
a
six
and
will
look
for
it
again
pours
a
very
slightly
hazy
deep
gold
a
white
head
patches
to
the
glass
as
a
nicesized
ring
smell
is
nice
and
biscuity
with
light
fruit
and
strawlike
notes
taste
is
a
nice
wash
of
citrus
on
a
very
light
malt
backing
followed
by
some
decent
bitter
hops
finishes
nottoodry
and
satisfying
good
refreshing
brew
d
goes
down
easy
inoffensive
not
bad
at
all
if
you
happen
to
see
one
around
and
have
a
thirst
to
quench
go
for
it
this
beer
pours
a
semihazy
golden
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
a
small
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
grassy
hops
and
pale
malt
there
is
a
hint
of
sulfur
in
the
background
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
aroma
nothing
in
the
taste
or
aroma
really
shines
but
nothing
is
out
of
whack
either
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
carbonation
that
is
a
little
too
high
for
my
liking
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
much
better
pilsners
out
there
on
both
sides
of
the
pond
an
average
pils
it
does
very
little
to
discriminate
itself
from
other
generic
pilseners
and
while
it
does
a
reasonable
job
at
emulating
a
style
that
doesnt
necessarily
make
it
a
particularly
good
beer
overall
excellent
for
the
style
the
aroma
is
right
on
as
is
the
flavor
o
it
just
doesnt
have
much
flavor
scrimshaw
is
a
decent
and
refreshing
craft
beer
that
has
some
nice
flavors
and
would
go
well
on
a
hot
and
humid
day
like
today
unfortunately
it
does
not
measure
up
to
many
of
the
other
fine
american
craft
brewed
versions
of
the
style
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
is
one
i
will
pass
up
any
time
in
favor
of
something
like
a
prima
pils
or
noble
pils
a
decent
pilsner
but
it
lacks
a
touch
of
depth
and
bitterness
the
graininess
is
also
a
little
over
the
top
for
my
tastes
i
have
been
drinking
a
lot
of
pilsners
mostly
american
and
this
one
is
highly
accessible
but
almost
a
bit
bland
all
about
the
yeast
being
the
dominant
flavor
and
smell
good
brew
overall
a
good
american
pilsner
but
i
think
it
could
be
better
if
maybe
the
citrus
notes
were
turned
down
and
the
spicyfloral
hops
kicked
up
a
few
notches
this
is
still
a
good
easydrinking
beer
though
and
one
i
could
see
myself
drinking
frequently
in
the
summer
months
m
very
good
mouthfeel
a
little
sweet
at
the
beginning
changing
to
some
bitterness
at
the
end
with
good
not
to
dry
finish
that
last
some
good
time
moreys
bottom
line
i
could
see
myself
grabbing
a
sixer
of
this
stuff
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wish
the
alcohol
was
just
a
touch
higher
though
overall
i
am
glad
to
find
another
north
cost
beer
this
far
across
the
map
and
this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
one
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
not
a
straight
forward
pilsner
has
a
lot
of
wheat
beer
characteristics
only
with
out
the
heavy
spiciness
a
certain
refresher
for
the
hot
days
of
summer
easily
drinkable
got
a
little
too
sweet
and
sour
for
me
after
a
bit
but
it
was
still
tolerable
almost
like
i
was
sucking
on
a
lemon
drop
well
made
german
style
pilsner
simple
sessionable
very
good
golden
brew
with
about
one
finger
of
head
that
sticks
around
for
quite
some
time
smells
crisp
and
grainy
with
hints
of
spice
and
citrus
fresh
grassy
flavor
with
sweet
citrus
never
seen
this
one
before
in
this
area
but
will
definitely
drink
again
if
i
see
it
overall
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
highly
drinkable
pils
the
taste
was
very
refreshing
and
it
would
be
a
perfect
warm
weather
beer
overall
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
light
this
is
a
very
crisp
clean
easy
drinking
beer
for
a
very
hot
day
o
not
a
fan
of
this
beer
im
sorry
to
say
overly
sweet
in
an
unfermented
sort
of
way
i
prolly
wont
buy
this
again
grade
b
this
is
a
wonderful
beer
i
love
it
highly
recommended
if
you
want
to
see
what
a
real
pilsener
ought
to
taste
like
vs
millerbud
etc
pours
a
clear
light
goldfish
yellow
with
a
nice
big
white
head
that
falls
pretty
quickly
to
a
blanket
nice
lacing
smells
of
pale
malt
with
some
definate
fruitiness
im
not
getting
a
ton
of
complexity
but
as
a
pilsner
that
isnt
out
of
the
the
ordinary
the
taste
is
the
same
lightly
sweet
with
some
fruitiness
though
it
is
balanced
with
a
nice
lightly
crisp
hop
presence
finishes
a
little
sweet
then
a
dry
aftertaste
body
is
light
carbonation
is
medium
and
nicely
put
together
making
for
a
smooth
easy
drinking
brew
overall
this
is
a
tasty
refreshing
light
bodied
brew
summer
time
is
made
for
this
beer
d
a
refreshing
mellow
german
style
pils
not
my
favorite
but
definitely
worth
a
try
i
instantly
fell
in
love
with
this
blond
frothy
pilsnerstyle
beer
i
had
it
on
tap
at
a
pizzeria
chain
with
a
seriously
respectable
draught
list
brixx
in
chapel
hill
nc
scrimshaw
has
the
best
possible
hop
character
as
far
as
i
am
concernedfloral
without
being
too
aggressive
or
bitter
some
belgianstyle
lacing
on
the
glass
dangerously
drinkable
ive
had
it
from
a
bottle
since
okay
a
few
bottles
and
it
is
just
as
great
i
plan
on
making
this
the
beer
of
summer
2011
as
it
is
important
to
have
a
plan
poured
a
nice
cloudy
straw
color
not
much
head
on
it
good
tasting
beer
nice
balance
light
mouthfeel
and
very
smooth
this
beer
went
down
really
easy
cant
complain
at
all
this
was
a
good
beer
overall
i
liked
it
quite
a
bit
nice
looking
pure
gold
beer
clear
with
an
ok
looking
head
smells
very
fresh
and
has
a
nice
hoppy
twang
to
it
but
also
balanced
taste
is
very
bright
and
somewhat
floral
and
lightly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
balancing
malt
emphasis
is
on
the
hops
here
which
gives
it
a
nice
clean
fresh
taste
eminently
drinkable
pils
with
a
nice
hop
profile
here
recommended
final
notes
a
solid
allpurpose
pilsner
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
serve
at
parties
its
very
sessionable
and
would
also
make
for
great
summer
refreshment
overall
im
impressed
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
nice
example
of
the
style
i
could
definitely
see
myself
enjoying
some
light
fish
or
pizza
with
this
im
going
to
have
another
good
drinkability
would
recommend
to
a
fan
of
pilsners
drinkability
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
attempt
at
a
pilsner
i
would
call
this
a
california
pilsner
this
is
a
perfect
beach
beer
its
a
beer
to
share
with
good
company
d
i
love
a
good
pilsner
but
this
left
me
underwhelmed
just
not
enough
flavor
and
character
color
is
very
light
straw
with
a
nice
frothy
head
color
is
quite
clear
and
pretty
aroma
is
typical
of
an
german
pilsner
combining
light
hops
and
light
malt
flavor
was
good
and
refreshing
will
be
perfect
his
summer
if
i
can
still
find
it
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
can
be
enjoyed
in
large
quantities
d
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
here
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
and
i
could
easily
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
in
a
sitting
definitely
worth
giving
it
a
shot
this
is
a
very
very
smooth
pilsner
even
if
youre
not
a
fan
of
this
style
id
recommend
giving
it
a
try
like
all
the
other
north
coast
brewery
beers
ive
tried
its
just
great
the
flavor
isnt
the
best
it
is
very
flat
and
grainy
whit
a
little
bit
of
diacetyl
the
hops
are
very
nice
but
the
mundane
malts
kind
of
deter
from
them
if
it
had
a
better
malt
flar
it
woudl
have
been
at
least
a
4
for
flavor
it
all
seems
very
thin
as
well
one
of
the
lightest
mouthfeels
i
have
come
across
in
a
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
light
i
did
not
get
too
much
taste
or
smell
which
some
people
would
enjoy
but
i
like
a
more
robust
taste
i
could
drink
many
of
these
in
one
sitting
but
would
probably
choose
something
with
more
obvious
tastes
and
complexities
beer
is
rather
bland
it
is
mildly
sweet
and
has
a
decent
finish
without
grain
astringency
or
any
bad
bitterness
the
overall
feel
of
the
beer
is
nice
no
aftertaste
wet
finish
its
ok
decent
a
light
beer
very
drinkable
had
this
on
tap
at
the
north
coast
brewery
and
i
thought
it
was
terrific
very
very
refreshing
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
that
same
night
i
drank
a
bottle
of
it
and
it
was
a
completely
different
story
it
didnt
taste
nearly
as
good
from
the
tap
it
had
exceptional
drinkability
but
from
a
bottle
it
tasted
way
too
carbonated
it
was
refreshing
at
all
i
would
get
this
beer
again
if
it
was
from
a
tap
but
not
from
a
bottle
plentiful
grass
and
hay
plus
a
touch
of
citrusy
sweetness
in
the
light
malty
nose
tastes
much
the
same
at
first
but
a
rather
pungent
earthy
hop
flavor
soon
kicks
in
and
has
a
fairly
stinging
bitterness
in
tow
toasty
with
lingering
musty
hay
in
the
finish
pretty
nice
little
pilsner
here
d
hmmmm
not
something
id
intentionally
grab
again
but
very
crisp
might
be
nice
on
a
hot
beach
drinkability
im
wondering
if
this
one
is
past
its
prime
since
the
flavors
are
so
mild
its
just
okay
i
guess
i
was
expecting
something
with
more
bite
and
crispness
to
it
which
this
does
not
have
not
a
bad
pils
but
not
much
hop
character
far
more
lemon
than
i
expected
a
quality
rendition
of
classic
german
brewing
perhaps
a
little
closer
to
a
helles
than
a
pils
nothing
stunningly
out
of
the
ordinary
but
nothing
wrong
either
in
a
beer
that
leaves
the
brewer
no
place
to
hide
a
good
transition
beer
for
a
bmc
drinker
nothing
they
havent
tasted
before
just
a
bit
more
of
it
than
theyre
used
to
finding
in
a
single
glass
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
hazy
yellow
with
a
short
white
head
of
less
than
an
inch
not
sure
just
what
the
nose
is
but
it
is
sort
of
fruity
and
the
flavor
although
light
is
different
than
what
i
normally
consider
a
pilsner
would
like
to
do
a
side
by
side
with
another
well
know
pilsner
d
average
drink
for
the
style
not
bad
but
true
pilsners
are
supposed
to
have
somewhat
of
a
hoppy
snap
to
them
and
this
one
just
sort
of
fizzles
out
without
much
hop
character
at
all
overall
decent
beer
overall
there
are
far
better
pilsners
out
there
so
i
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
however
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
if
better
options
arent
available
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
mouthfeel
was
ok
but
again
the
musty
flavor
kind
of
lingers
but
very
easy
to
drink
served
from
tap
into
a
shaker
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
pure
white
head
there
was
no
apparent
lacing
evident
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
slightly
bitter
malt
wheat
and
rye
the
flavor
was
of
bitter
malt
wheat
slight
spice
and
slight
fruit
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
very
nice
and
smooth
brew
the
aroma
unfortunately
was
lacking
bigtime
as
i
had
to
almost
hyperventilate
to
find
anything
in
it
the
flavor
was
also
just
okay
as
it
was
very
light
i
would
have
liked
them
to
have
made
both
the
aroma
and
flavor
a
little
more
pronounced
in
this
one
but
hey
you
cant
win
them
all
this
might
not
be
everyones
idea
of
the
best
beer
but
to
me
this
beer
was
superb
it
has
a
strong
inviting
wheat
smell
and
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
great
head
on
it
it
has
a
medium
body
feel
thats
not
too
heavy
or
too
light
it
goes
down
well
with
a
smooth
delicious
taste
definetly
a
must
try
pours
a
bright
gold
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
tons
of
carbonation
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
a
little
minimal
hot
aroma
tastes
very
clean
and
malty
and
some
little
hop
bitterness
a
fairly
average
beer
as
far
as
taste
average
on
mouthfeel
and
body
drinkability
isnt
bad
very
clean
great
brew
fun
and
enjoyable
distinct
notes
in
the
taste
but
nothing
that
distracts
it
from
being
a
refreshing
pilsner
try
it
out
i
do
take
a
little
off
the
drinkability
however
solely
for
the
low
abv
at
4
4
not
cool
this
poured
a
yellow
straw
with
a
nice
thick
lacey
head
that
sticks
to
glass
malts
and
hops
highlighted
in
taste
sweet
grassy
goodness
is
very
well
crafted
against
a
wall
of
classic
pilsner
hops
good
feel
this
one
has
a
sweet
smoothe
finish
after
a
sticky
feel
that
has
good
carbonation
which
produces
a
smoothe
finish
this
is
a
mainstay
pilsner
at
my
house
a
must
for
anyone
who
likes
the
style
md
this
is
an
extremely
easy
drinker
very
refreshing
a
good
pilsener
is
exactly
what
this
is
nothing
extreme
or
getting
in
the
way
of
the
clear
crisp
taste
d
excellent
session
beer
as
refreshing
as
a
kölsch
with
the
complexity
of
a
dortmunder
yet
still
quintessentially
a
german
pilsener
overall
a
very
nice
example
of
a
pilsner
and
quickly
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
standards
d
subtle
tasty
nothing
harsh
at
all
this
is
a
tasty
beverage
i
believe
it
defines
drinkable
i
first
tried
scrimshaw
at
show
dogs
in
san
francisco
the
girl
working
recommended
i
get
it
to
compliment
my
pickled
hot
link
a
surprisingly
classy
variation
of
our
spicy
friend
sure
its
a
4
4
abv
little
wimp
but
even
then
the
taste
is
lacking
watery
is
an
understatement
it
feels
like
drinking
club
soda
you
can
drink
it
quick
though
d
great
drinkability
if
i
had
to
go
out
and
wanted
a
pils
this
would
be
one
of
the
first
id
get
since
its
pretty
available
thats
a
bonus
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
i
like
it
i
was
surprised
at
the
lack
of
hops
but
its
forgiveable
value
in
my
opinion
one
of
the
best
things
about
this
underrated
brewery
is
the
price
of
their
beers
under
10
bucks
a
sixer
overall
i
feel
what
this
one
might
sacrifice
in
flavor
makes
up
for
with
drinkability
it
comes
close
to
replicating
the
malt
flavor
of
classic
european
pils
such
as
golden
pheasant
and
pinkus
urpils
but
could
use
some
more
bittering
hop
character
d
easy
drinking
not
an
awardwinning
beer
imo
but
i
could
throw
back
several
of
these
on
a
hot
day
lightmoderate
in
body
feeling
a
bit
fuller
due
to
lower
than
normal
level
of
co2
a
touch
more
spritziness
and
this
would
be
a
killer
pils
its
damn
drinkable
as
it
is
ordered
this
one
in
a
taproom
and
was
vary
pleased
this
beer
is
solid
as
one
might
expect
from
north
coast
its
is
as
good
as
any
pilsner
ive
had
it
drinks
easy
has
a
hint
of
subtle
fruit
flavor
and
smells
very
good
it
also
pours
very
nicely
from
the
tap
with
a
fluffy
head
id
pick
this
one
again
on
draft
and
might
pick
it
up
as
a
favor
for
a
host
when
a
house
guest
overall
i
remember
this
beer
tasting
crisper
and
having
more
hop
influence
from
the
bottle
so
ill
have
to
give
it
another
shot
at
some
point
even
as
it
is
its
a
good
beer
and
an
easydrinking
one
for
the
summer
months
pairing
tostada
of
grouper
ceviche
pickled
nopales
and
cherry
tomatoes
overall
very
very
decent
for
the
style
not
that
the
germans
have
anything
to
worry
about
you
can
put
these
down
easily
it
misses
a
bit
in
some
areas
of
structure
but
overall
pretty
decent
drinkability
another
beer
that
is
making
my
list
of
favorites
i
would
drink
this
again
i
think
this
is
a
nice
intro
to
craft
beer
for
those
getting
off
the
bud
bus
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
retains
ok
but
leaves
nice
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
bready
and
biscuity
malt
upfront
along
with
floral
and
spicy
hops
lemon
mineral
and
a
little
alcohol
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
biscuit
and
bread
dough
upfront
a
little
graininess
some
lemon
soap
cane
sugar
and
some
hay
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
drinkability
is
excellent
overall
a
decent
and
impressively
drinkable
pilsner
but
not
particularly
tasty
or
complex
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
also
quite
sessionable
given
its
low
alcohol
content
db
good
price
and
very
smooth
flavor
i
like
the
malt
profile
and
the
fruit
aspect
of
this
beer
the
most
would
be
a
great
session
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
brilliant
carbonation
with
body
on
the
light
side
of
medium
and
one
of
the
easiest
drinkers
around
i
think
the
carbonation
of
this
beer
with
the
tiny
bright
bubbles
is
the
best
of
any
beer
i
have
ever
had
a
standby
pours
a
medium
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
malty
with
some
hop
aroma
with
a
slightly
sweet
smell
the
taste
is
crisp
very
balanced
with
nice
depth
to
the
flavor
starts
sweet
with
the
malt
and
finishes
with
a
light
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
almost
medium
nice
carbonation
this
is
an
easy
drinker
probably
what
comes
to
most
peoples
minds
when
they
think
of
beer
but
this
has
more
depth
and
flavor
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
definitely
worth
checking
out
pours
out
a
hazy
iced
tea
color
with
a
thin
head
and
a
few
bubbles
smells
mildly
sweet
and
floral
taste
is
dry
and
malty
with
a
tartness
becoming
more
evident
as
it
warms
it
feels
crisp
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
to
me
this
tastes
like
a
very
good
example
of
relatively
generic
beer
its
very
drinkable
and
reminds
me
of
time
i
spent
in
england
i
would
drink
this
again
d
very
high
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
that
would
go
well
with
an
afternoon
of
mowing
the
lawn
followed
by
an
evening
grilling
up
some
eats
d
at
4
4
this
is
a
serious
session
beer
candidate
definitely
worth
trying
d
at
4
4
its
highly
sessionable
a
good
beer
a
well
made
pilsner
on
par
or
a
step
above
sa
noble
pils
though
very
similar
i
could
buy
this
again
on
a
warm
weather
day
pilsners
are
always
a
bit
light
on
taste
for
me
but
i
do
enjoy
them
in
the
summer
definitely
recommend
giving
it
a
try
a
good
attempt
at
a
lighter
style
but
i
dont
think
i
would
put
it
in
my
top
5
pilsners
definitely
worth
a
try
though
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
not
gonna
blow
anyone
away
with
this
one
but
definitely
sessionable
and
great
for
the
hot
days
overall
a
good
to
very
good
pils
tasty
for
sure
scrimshaw
isnt
bad
by
any
means
its
pretty
solid
for
the
most
part
i
just
with
the
flavor
held
up
to
the
impressive
aroma
most
likely
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
with
the
possible
exception
of
finding
it
on
tap
most
of
north
coasts
beers
i
really
dig
this
one
is
decent
different
but
not
high
on
my
list
for
domestic
pilsners
guess
ill
have
to
sample
more
pilsners
this
summer
including
this
one
again
and
see
if
im
buggin
drinkability
sure
the
body
was
much
fuller
than
average
but
not
at
all
heavy
drinkability
was
very
good
as
well
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
while
listening
to
a
ballgame
and
watching
the
grass
grow
drinkability
very
sessionable
light
and
easy
to
drink
very
good
example
of
a
pils
and
a
highly
quaffable
one
at
that
d
very
drinkable
session
type
beer
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
but
for
its
style
its
very
smooth
and
enjoyable
d
not
too
bad
that
aroma
is
light
and
clean
but
the
flavor
is
not
quite
as
smooth
there
is
a
hint
of
fruitiness
and
some
husky
grainy
qualities
to
the
malt
character
that
i
didnt
detect
in
the
aroma
the
hop
character
is
a
bit
weak
for
my
taste
as
well
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
bitterness
and
aroma
to
balance
this
level
of
sweetness
enjoyable
but
there
are
certainly
better
pilsners
out
there
to
be
found
with
little
effort
d
when
i
shock
wheat
this
summer
i
will
bring
several
cases
of
this
and
will
drink
till
its
gone
a
lot
of
german
pilseners
have
a
lemony
taste
but
most
try
to
balance
it
with
a
malty
sweet
this
one
didnt
drinkability
decent
but
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
mellow
which
may
have
you
looking
for
a
bolder
lower
alcohol
pils
a
pils
that
i
wouldnt
turn
down
but
there
are
others
that
i
would
go
to
first
hop
bitterness
comes
through
a
bit
more
in
the
flavor
but
has
me
questioning
my
initial
guess
at
the
hallertau
varietal
still
has
a
hint
of
fruit
to
it
and
the
malts
are
too
heavy
for
a
pilsner
while
im
complaining
i
wouldnt
mind
more
flavoring
hop
additions
its
still
a
fairly
enjoyable
beer
to
drink
but
i
think
i
will
limit
my
exposure
to
this
as
a
taponly
occasional
purchase
it
is
a
damn
shame
there
are
not
more
fresh
delicious
pilsners
brewed
in
the
u
s
excluding
you
lucky
dogs
in
pa
d
easily
could
put
down
a
few
its
a
good
sessionable
pilsner
drinkability
easy
drinking
i
will
buy
again
this
poured
a
clear
gold
with
some
white
head
it
smelled
like
creamy
yeast
and
toasted
barley
and
bread
crust
with
a
bit
of
copper
and
lemon
hops
it
tasted
like
lemon
and
copper
hops
with
bready
yeast
and
some
light
barley
malt
it
was
slightly
thick
with
some
carbonation
and
had
a
mild
bitter
aftertaste
overall
this
was
a
very
simple
beer
with
a
taste
that
was
good
enough
but
could
have
been
cleaner
it
had
nice
body
and
was
very
easy
to
drink
it
was
just
hard
to
get
excited
about
this
beer
and
i
would
have
expected
something
a
bit
bigger
and
cleaner
from
north
coast
mouthfeel
diminishes
as
it
goes
on
becomes
more
typical
pilsner
drinkable
on
a
hot
summer
dsy
drinkability
a
nice
beer
i
will
have
again
mouthfeel
is
light
drinkable
beer
not
spectacular
but
i
could
go
through
a
couple
of
these
if
i
was
bumming
around
this
is
a
pilsner
with
excellent
flavor
and
it
has
an
average
drinkability
compared
to
other
pilsners
that
i
have
consumed
surprisingly
complex
malt
character
for
a
pilsner
unfortunately
the
grainy
malt
and
light
fruit
notes
seem
to
muddle
the
crispness
i
would
usually
associate
with
the
style
d
would
give
this
another
try
only
in
that
maybe
this
was
just
a
bad
bottle
but
maybe
its
just
not
my
style
very
drinkable
this
one
might
give
prima
pils
a
run
as
my
favorite
craft
pilsener
overall
i
wasnt
happy
with
the
beer
it
reminded
me
of
blue
moon
far
too
much
this
i
found
disturbing
because
i
was
under
the
impression
i
was
drinking
a
pilsner
not
a
watered
down
wheat
beer
i
tried
this
beer
at
a
wine
restaurant
called
the
vine
in
san
clemente
ca
trying
a
beer
sight
unseen
at
a
wine
place
is
not
always
the
best
idea
but
i
will
provide
the
blind
test
prior
to
my
knowledge
of
the
style
or
brewer
prior
to
my
remarks
good
pour
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
pale
golden
color
that
struck
me
right
away
as
being
the
perfect
color
of
a
german
pils
fine
white
head
and
visible
carbonation
that
still
left
some
lacing
in
the
glass
right
down
to
the
finish
good
aroma
of
slight
hop
characteristics
with
some
good
floral
background
beer
was
somewhat
sweet
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
great
finish
this
was
a
clean
well
balanced
and
flavor
beer
only
after
i
came
home
and
looked
it
up
did
i
realize
that
this
beer
was
another
product
out
of
north
coast
brewing
company
to
date
this
place
has
not
let
me
down
and
i
just
wish
more
of
their
products
were
available
in
texas
great
showing
for
the
style
and
definitely
a
beer
i
would
enjoy
again
d
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pilsener
that
i
enjoy
good
standout
beer
to
introduce
to
the
bmc
crowd
quite
surprised
this
beer
doesnt
get
more
praise
then
what
it
does
taste
could
be
a
little
more
but
then
again
this
style
doesnt
call
for
that
this
is
my
2nd
favorite
german
pilsener
behind
saint
arnold
summer
pils
fantastic
complexity
and
taste
i
highly
recommend
scrimshaw
drinkability
is
better
than
most
pils
imho
for
my
preference
nice
work
ncbc
d
this
would
be
very
sessionable
if
it
only
had
a
more
pronounced
flavor
not
a
bad
pilsner
would
not
buy
again
considering
the
superior
prim
pils
is
available
for
the
same
price
worth
trying
once
prost
has
a
nice
light
golden
yellow
body
with
a
thin
white
head
that
thins
rather
quickly
aroma
is
a
sweet
wheat
smell
with
maybe
a
hint
of
citrus
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
the
hops
are
there
but
the
citrus
gets
more
distinct
after
it
warms
nice
and
crisp
with
a
good
hop
aftertaste
taste
and
aroma
could
be
more
distinctstrong
but
overall
a
good
beer
a
grain
forward
brew
with
just
a
slight
sugary
sweetness
hops
may
be
there
a
bit
metallic
but
not
necessarily
balanced
a
good
drinkble
pils
though
clean
and
delish
scrimshaw
is
a
pleasant
summer
beer
that
doesnt
have
much
to
excite
but
is
more
than
adequate
for
a
little
refreshment
notes
north
coast
again
demonstrates
its
understanding
of
another
beer
style
in
a
very
good
pilsener
d
refreshing
easydrinking
beer
ill
be
going
back
to
this
one
when
i
want
a
great
session
beer
drinkabilitywhy
when
there
are
so
many
much
better
pilsners
out
there
especially
those
made
within
3045
minutes
from
me
this
isnt
awful
just
mostly
bland
this
is
very
drinkable
not
fullbodied
enough
for
a
cold
weather
brew
just
my
opinion
d
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
taste
combination
makes
this
beer
very
enjoyable
a
nice
cool
crisp
beer
that
made
me
ready
for
the
summer
months
very
easy
drinking
beer
d
very
drinkable
very
good
all
around
and
does
nothing
wrong
taste
is
crisp
and
tangy
some
lemon
light
grain
a
little
malt
and
subtle
hops
ends
on
the
dry
side
with
just
a
tad
bit
of
bitterness
drinkability
this
beer
has
a
nice
flavor

is
really
easy
to
drink

vt
not
your
typical
pilsner
less
tradtional
but
certainly
worth
trying
the
low
abv
is
a
nice
bonus
on
top
of
that
had
this
as
part
of
a
late
night
session
few
days
ago
poured
a
golden
straw
color
with
medium
head
that
faded
quickly
and
left
no
lacing
smelled
of
corn
earthy
hops
and
light
malts
tasted
malty
with
a
light
hop
kick
very
smooth
just
a
little
bit
dry
quite
sessionable
d
very
tasty
a
great
summer
beer
but
might
be
a
little
overpriced
here
in
vermont
a
very
mild
pilsner
with
a
small
head
unless
agitated
then
nicely
lacy
nose
fruitier
than
most
prodominently
apple
and
honey
palate
is
not
particularly
pollen
or
earthy
bitter
a
brighter
pils
with
not
much
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
tad
sweet
but
nothing
that
would
diminish
the
beer
really
not
very
clean
in
taste
or
well
i
guess
a
better
word
to
use
is
astringent
a
good
go
to
for
a
very
mild
american
pils
prickly
initially
medium
bodied
somewhat
bready
but
also
quite
crisp
a
rather
nice
certainly
drinkable
pils
with
a
nice
feel
it
leans
a
bit
more
heavily
towards
the
malt
than
id
prefer
d
solid
pils
very
drikable
and
wont
dissappoint
in
the
fall
slightly
cloudy
gold
with
active
bubbles
and
no
head
the
smell
is
lemons
slight
pepper
and
sharp
hops
the
taste
is
lemmons
farmyard
funk
and
slight
malt
its
slightly
slippery
and
a
bit
thin
this
one
makes
for
very
easy
drinking
its
very
balanced
you
could
make
an
afternoon
of
it
i
intend
to
pleasant
bread
malt
flavors
continue
on
first
sip
and
the
slightly
bitter
hops
are
more
present
than
on
the
nose
very
good
balance
mouthfeel
is
creamy
and
well
carbonated
thicker
than
most
pilsners
drinkability
as
it
should
be
in
this
style
is
amazing
had
a
second
while
typing
this
up
possibly
my
favorite
low
abv
beer
this
year
drinkablity
is
good
but
for
the
money
i
would
drink
a
honkers
instead
d
a
nononsense
brew
a
solid
pilsner
reviewed
from
notes
had
this
at
the
houston
flying
saucer
on
tap
poured
into
a
pint
glass
apears
a
nice
thick
golden
color
with
a
one
inch
head
lot
of
bready
and
biscuity
malts
and
some
hops
in
the
aroma
i
was
hoping
for
a
bigger
hop
bite
but
it
is
still
great
to
drink
lot
of
malt
presence
which
provides
a
sweet
dry
enjoyable
finish
paired
nicely
with
some
brat
will
try
again
d
a
great
session
beer
not
all
that
unique
which
may
cause
this
to
be
a
bit
forgettable
but
it
is
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
very
drinkable
i
enjoyed
it
a
lot
tap

in
mammoth
poured
clear

with
a
short
puffy
white

average

floral
sweet

with

without

clean

taste
throughout
strong

and
grassy

as
well
pleasant
cereal
grain
flavor
towards
the
finish
sweet
dry
finish
a
very
very
good
pilsner
the
drinkability
on
scrimshaw
is
high
overall
given
the
abv
and
the
easygoing
nature
of
the
brew
11
29
for
a
sixer
is
too
high
but
overall
north
coast
has
crafted
a
pretty
tasty
pilsener
have
to
say
this
and
prima
pilz
are
the
two
best
pilsners
ive
had
d
solid
easy
drinking
beer
a
fresher
sample
would
probably
be
even
more
tasty
with
just
a
touch
more
hops
to
it
d
perfectly
crisp
and
cleansing
marvelous
companion
to
a
spicy
stromboli
as
mentioned
i
have
ignored
north
coast
as
a
brewery
and
have
heard
many
good
things
i
have
a
feeling
these
claims
are
founded
well
done
pils
i
appreciate
beers
that
respect
their
style
yet
still
manage
to
stand
out
from
the
pack
scrimshaws
calling
card
for
me
was
the
sweeter
almost
fruity
malt
presence
that
stood
up
to
the
hop
flavors
i
would
definitely
try
this
as
a
stepping
stone
beer
for
a
few
of
my
friends
this
is
a
drinkable
pilsener
that
goes
great
with
spicy
food
has
a
surprising
hoppiness
to
it
aside
from
not
quite
meeting
my
hop
expectations
it
was
very
enjoyable
with
good
balance
throughout
verdict
would
definitely
buy
again
but
unlikely
to
make
it
into
heavy
rotation
this
is
a
good
interpretation
of
a
pilsner
but
hardly
the
best
available
it
is
a
delicate
beer
that
should
have
a
freshness
date
it
is
too
costly
a
six
pack
to
chance
the
freshness
a
good
pilsener
something
i
usually
have
around
nothing
extreme
but
very
enjoyable
overall
i
would
recommend
this
if
you
have
never
had
it
but
i
will
not
be
getting
it
again
m
mouthfeel
is
rich
and
enjoyable
overall
this
could
be
an
easy
session
for
when
one
isnt
inclined
to
drink
anything
too
harsh
on
the
palate
hazy
golden
color
with
one
finger
head
smells
tart
like
green
apples
taste
tart
like
green
apples
pretty
sweet
finish
and
not
as
tart
in
the
end
all
in
all
this
isnt
a
bad
pilsner
although
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
i
could
drink
this
again
good
session
starter
could
be
a
session
beer
if
one
likes
the
flat
background
ran
about
10
a
sixer
aint
cheap
though
generous
if
delicate
bone
white
head
thickness
complemented
by
sticky
lacing
light
brass
orange
color
fading
to
yellow
where
glass
tapers
off
lowkey
persistence
in
the
nose
with
sourdough
wild
yeasts
and
wet
straw
lemon
oil
and
rock
salt
becomes
more
herbaceous
as
it
warms
however
the
citrus
scents
never
get
past
a
barely
audible
mutter
lightbodied
to
watery
minimal
palate
presence
leans
heavily
on
the
bitterness
and
sour
grassiness
to
remind
you
its
there
the
carbonation
not
helping
keeps
the
flavors
from
settling
in
and
elevate
texture
of
pellegrino
thing
pretzel
dough
rye
bread
the
malts
appear
to
offer
naught
but
a
softening
effect
on
the
overall
texture
as
it
finishes
theres
a
moment
of
pink
grapefruit
and
orange
citrus
but
its
totally
dry
it
either
has
to
be
a
lot
crisper
or
offer
more
flavor
diversity
to
excel
in
its
category
appearance
is
a
light
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
looks
like
a
pilnser
to
me
the
smell
also
has
a
lightness
to
it
along
with
a
very
faint
citrus
element
upon
sipping
it
it
tastes
like
some
fresh
baked
bread
not
bad
mouthfeel
is
great
for
a
pilsner
with
more
pleasure
involved
than
most
others
in
this
style
drinkability
is
most
certainly
here
1
it
is
a
pilsner
2
it
is
a
very
good
pilsner
drinkability
lacking
a
sourness
i
was
looking
for
but
otherwise
large
in
flavor
i
could
definitely
fill
up
on
these
but
i
may
get
a
bit
bored
also
heavier
than
youd
think
for
a
pils
i
think
this
would
make
a
nice
transitional
beer
from
bmc
to
a
pale
wheat
ale
or
even
a
pale
ale
it
looks
like
bmc
but
adds
more
to
the
table
i
was
hoping
for
more
from
this
one
not
bad
and
a
fair
take
on
the
style
but
not
really
one
ill
make
a
point
of
getting
again
some
interesting
stuff
going
on
but
not
quite
the
complexity
or
crisp
bite
that
i
was
hoping
for
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
the
only
pilsner
option
and
i
was
really
craving
a
pilsner
but
the
chance
of
those
two
coinciding
is
fairly
slim
overall
impression
i
was
really
expecting
more
from
this
beer
the
beer
though
lack
is
complexity
and
truly
lacks
in
the
crisp
fresh
feeling
i
want
from
a
nice
pils
i
would
say
its
worth
a
try
if
you
can
find
a
single
bottle
however
if
you
have
to
get
a
six
pack
look
for
another
pils
out
there
the
same
brewery
that
makes
old
rasputin
makes
this
beer
as
well
oy
vey
i
have
to
say
i
didnt
like
this
at
all
i
hope
i
just
got
an
old
bottle
or
something
picked
up
a
single
of
this
because
of
the
cool
looking
label
and
i
like
pilseneres
so
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
pours
a
yellow
color
with
zero
head
and
i
mean
zero
like
i
havent
seen
anything
like
it
no
lacing
either
obviously
taste
is
kind
of
sour
and
doesnt
have
a
good
mouthfeel
at
all
had
this
following
a
prima
pils
and
the
difference
was
very
apparent
would
not
prefer
to
try
again
like
i
said
i
hope
it
was
just
a
bad
bottle
i
got
d
if
it
didnt
drink
well
this
beer
would
be
more
of
a
looker
than
a
drinker
i
have
not
been
a
big
fan
of
pilsners
as
they
most
remind
me
of
the
bmc
days
scrimshaw
has
a
lot
of
flavor
and
while
it
is
not
complex
per
se
it
has
some
things
going
on
this
is
a
damn
solid
beer
and
one
i
will
pick
up
when
the
weather
gets
warmer
great
value
as
well
the
creamy
feel
and
sweetness
of
the
beer
kills
any
more
refined
pils
malt
flavor
involved
however
its
present
but
subdued
to
say
the
least
in
the
end
an
orangey
sweetness
overtakes
and
limits
drinkability
a
bit
drying
and
harsh
in
a
raw
grain
sense
i
picked
this
up
because
the
weather
was
unseasonably
warm
and
a
pilsner
sounded
just
right
i
cant
say
i
was
disappointed
with
this
one
however
it
doesnt
quite
stack
up
to
victory
prima
pils
d
great
beer
for
activities
and
hot
weather
quenching
yet
flavorful
for
the
style
aftertaste
is
clean
and
not
too
long
lasting
so
you
can
keep
reaching
for
another
drinkability
most
everything
about
this
beer
was
exceptional
with
the
exception
of
the
oh
so
important
taste
not
sure
exactly
what
the
off
flavor
was
but
it
was
enough
to
ruin
this
beer
for
me
poured
from
a
fat
squat
north
coast
12oz
bottle
the
beer
is
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
color
3
finger
foam
the
smell
is
toasted
malt
grainy
malt
all
malt
the
taste
is
likewise
strong
with
bisuit
and
toasted
malt
a
little
bitterness
but
not
much
very
tasty
but
id
like
a
little
more
hops
in
it
this
is
a
solid
brew
one
i
would
recommend
to
my
friends
it
has
a
character
and
pizazz
that
most
pilsners
struggle
to
find
this
is
a
superior
pilsener
worth
seeking
out
notes
this
is
not
a
beer
to
sit
and
ponder
over
exploring
different
flavors
and
feelings
this
is
a
beer
to
enjoy
while
eating
cooking
or
hanging
out
definitely
a
good
choice
when
youre
looking
for
a
flavorful
beer
without
the
heaviness
of
something
better
better
being
opinion
only
obviously
shimmering
golden
with
stead
carbonation
and
a
decent
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
quickly
smell
is
solid
with
a
good
earthy
hop
character
and
lightly
sweet
scent
of
bready
malt
great
taste
that
is
well
balanced
and
has
pretty
big
flavor
for
such
a
small
beer
light
grain
and
light
sweetness
again
earthy
hop
presence
and
biscuity
bread
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
very
refreshing
i
could
session
this
one
with
ease
just
an
overall
great
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
savoring
again
maybe
a
little
closer
to
the
summer
d
decent
drinkable
pilsner
with
some
hoppiness
keeps
things
interesting
throughout
the
course
of
the
drink
two
fingers
of
head
atop
a
golden
sunshine
pilsner
yellow
good
center
column
of
bubbling
beneath
a
solid
film
o
foam
the
aroma
is
a
soft
herbal
grass
and
mint
note
in
the
aroma
along
with
the
dry
malt
aromas
as
well
clear
palate
helps
creat
definition
between
the
super
dry
toasted
sweet
malts
with
the
herbalgrassy
hops
the
palae
is
dry
and
hoppy
for
this
german
pilsner
very
rich
malty
finish
for
this
pils
ok
drinkability
maybe
a
little
bit
better
if
it
wasnt
for
the
dry
sweetness
out
of
a
bottle
this
german
style
pilsener
was
a
perfectly
clear
bright
gold
color
with
a
pure
white
head
poor
retention
and
weak
lacing
the
aroma
was
mostly
clean
pale
malt
and
some
hints
of
sweetness
in
floral
hops
the
flavors
were
at
first
very
malty
with
some
dry
grain
notes
hiding
in
the
beginning
as
well
it
then
got
more
hoppy
as
it
went
on
leading
to
a
crisp
finish
nothing
too
deep
about
it
but
pleasant
enough
the
body
was
mediumlight
the
carbonation
lively
on
the
tongue
and
the
mouthfeel
a
little
prickly
as
a
result
an
ok
beer
but
one
of
the
weaker
offering
from
this
world
class
brewery
d
something
i
will
seek
out
this
summer
its
absolutely
refreshing
even
on
a
cold
winters
night
an
exceptionally
drinkable
brew
and
overall
a
nice
pilsener
but
nothing
mindblowing
or
extraordinary
a
superb
session
beer
though
a
little
more
dry
bitterness
would
be
welcome
a
goto
beer
for
many
cuisines
and
many
occasions
fantastic
d
a
good
beer
from
north
coast
i
liked
it
nice
drinkable
pilsner
beer
i
couldve
had
quite
a
few
of
these
tonight
tastes
like
pale
malts
then
moves
into
a
spicier
profile
with
a
hint
of
citrus
grapefruit
before
finishing
with
hops
carbonation
is
just
right
with
a
nice
creamy
mouthfeel
for
this
type
of
pilsner
id
rather
have
a
brooklyn
and
this
doesnt
compare
to
a
victory
prima
pils
d
imminently
drinkable
this
beer
was
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
if
it
were
cheap
i
would
but
it
constantly
as
it
is
though
i
would
not
pay
the
price
it
sells
light
straw
color
with
a
medium
white
head
aroma
is
grassy
lightly
floral
a
touch
spicy
the
flavor
is
light
mild
and
wellbalanced
creamy
mouthfeel
lightly
fruity
almost
apricots
with
a
dry
but
not
crisp
finish
for
the
most
part
it
is
enjoyable
but
certainly
not
a
favorite
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
offwhite
head
smell
is
yeasty
with
a
hint
of
hay
and
an
ever
so
slight
whiff
of
sulfur
taste
is
wonderful
light
bready
malt
with
a
taste
of
fresh
cut
grass
in
the
finish
fantastic
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
smooth
carbonation
levels
slightly
high
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
relatively
low
abv
and
light
flavor
make
this
a
great
beer
to
have
when
drinking
more
than
one
at
a
time
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
for
sure
very
light
gold
in
color
on
the
pour
a
little
froth
but
its
quickly
gone
before
a
second
sip
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
but
pretty
floral
and
somewhat
spicy
taste
is
more
of
the
spice
some
lemon
and
some
slight
hops
this
is
absolutely
wonderful
on
draft
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
very
good
pilsener
maybe
one
of
the
better
that
ive
had
really
nice
beer
to
drink
well
done
not
much
to
talk
about
on
the
appearance
nor
the
smell
however
i
would
say
that
the
taste
is
simple
balanced
and
well
done
a
very
solid
pilsener
certainly
worth
the
buy
north
coast
brewing
ompany
scores
well
here
delicious
on
the
palate
and
leaves
you
much
inclined
towards
another
bottle
poured
a
dark
golden
color
pils
with
a
huge
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
minimal
lacing
aroma
of
noble
hops
is
more
dominant
then
expected
with
a
clean
malt
profile
taste
is
also
a
mix
between
clean
and
lightly
sweet
malt
profile
with
some
distinctive
dry
noble
hops
full
body
with
some
good
carbonation
a
bit
hoppier
then
i
was
expected
but
still
very
enjoyable
prost
pours
a
hazy
and
somewhat
dull
gold
with
some
large
chunks
of
yeast
that
settles
quickly
a
soft
white
head
is
medium
in
size
and
leaves
some
lacing
as
it
dropsno
bonus
points
for
hang
time
here
the
nose
is
subtly
sweet
and
smells
of
fresh
grains
and
some
nice
earthy
aromas
this
has
good
flavor
for
a
pilsgrainy
pale
malts
and
some
fresh
dry
hop
flavors
compliment
each
other
nicely
slight
metallic
flavors
kept
me
from
giving
it
a
better
grade
the
body
is
light
to
medium
with
good
carbonation
and
nice
clean
slightly
drying
finish
a
good
old
easy
drinkin
pilsill
have
another
the
taste
is
as
above
with
bread
toasted
crackers
lemon
a
hint
of
grapefruit
honey
and
a
little
vanilla
esp
in
the
finish
its
very
clean
and
easy
to
drink
zesty
and
fairly
lively
with
strong
persistent
character
that
stays
interesting
d
this
is
what
macros
should
strive
for
you
can
have
this
anywhere
with
anything
drinkability
is
perhaps
the
highest
ive
ever
drank
tastes
great
goes
down
smooth
just
a
touch
of
hop
on
the
clean
finish
just
asks
for
another
taste
north
cost
presents
an
excellent
example
of
what
a
pilsner
can
be
this
one
is
very
refreshing
and
worthy
of
sharing
with
the
buddies
scrimshaw
certainly
is
a
candidate
for
enticing
the
more
timid
over
to
the
craft
movement
bring
enough
to
accompany
any
activity
during
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
a
really
good
beer
to
say
im
pleasantly
surprised
would
be
an
understatement
the
color
is
a
brightish
golden
topped
with
a
very
nice
frothy
white
head
there
ends
up
being
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
malty
with
grassy
and
grainy
notes
with
some
fruitiness
to
it
this
might
be
one
of
the
best
tasting
pilsners
ive
ever
had
it
is
crisp
a
little
sweet
with
a
great
blend
of
malts
and
hops
a
hint
of
a
lemon
zing
is
mixed
in
nothing
seems
out
of
place
clean
smooth
and
very
refreshing
this
would
be
a
great
choice
for
an
everyday
beer
you
dont
get
sick
of
a
true
winner
edit
i
had
this
beer
on
tap
at
north
coasts
own
taproom
and
the
flavor
came
through
a
bit
better
this
time
for
me
drinkability
easy
drinking
great
beer
for
anytime
all
day
long
a
pleasant
pilsener
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
i
can
see
how
on
a
very
hot
day
its
a
welcome
change
of
pace
drinkability
is
moderate
definitely
sessionalbe
and
decent
flavor
but
just
boring
this
was
on
tap
at
the
desmond
hotel
where
my
fiancee
heretofore
known
as
the
wife
and
i
will
be
having
our
reception
in
october
i
decided
i
must
try
it
after
wedding
person
at
the
hotel
mentioned
it
in
the
list
of
beer
available
im
looking
forward
to
having
this
along
with
the
yuengling
and
sam
adams
that
will
be
available
at
our
open
bar
recommended
drinkability
is
somewhat
ok
ive
had
better
pilseners
though
lots
of
flavor
here
with
a
pale
malt
base
and
herbal
spicy
hop
accompaniment
the
texture
is
also
smooth
and
surprisingly
creamy
for
the
style
there
is
a
good
deal
to
like
here
definitely
worth
trying
pours
a
somewhat
cloudy
orangeish
hue
similar
to
alot
of
hefes
out
there
has
a
nice
sized
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
the
beer
still
has
healthy
carbonation
smell
is
surprising
with
it
being
a
pilsner
one
would
think
that
it
would
be
more
hoppy
but
there
is
alot
of
malty
sweetness
that
comes
through
almost
dominates
taste
is
smooth
has
a
slight
tanginess
to
it
on
the
tounge
but
then
becomes
smooth
pretty
good
beer
all
around
d
its
a
soso
german
pils
d
unfortunately
the
buttery
presence
detracts
from
my
overall
enjoyment
of
this
pils
it
really
hinders
the
crispness
of
this
brew
in
my
opinion
its
not
bad
but
i
dont
think
ill
go
out
of
my
way
for
another
notes
a
perfectly
drinkable
but
fairly
average
american
pils
mid
gold
with
a
frothy
head
and
a
great
brewery
smell
that
makes
this
beer
unique
this
is
well
made
pils
with
a
crispness
combined
with
a
certain
breadiness
in
the
mid
body
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
the
summer
time
this
does
not
taste
like
every
other
pilsner
which
is
a
selling
point
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thin
with
less
carbonation
bite
that
i
would
have
expected
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
light
mouthfeel
easily
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
had
to
date
this
is
my
new
go
to
summer
beer
d
definitely
drinkable
could
have
a
few
of
these
north
coast
continues
to
impress
scrimshaw
pours
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
a
bit
of
an
amber
tint
to
it
and
a
cap
of
fine
white
bubbles
lightly
grainy
and
toasted
with
some
herbal
floral
and
spicy
hops
same
in
the
taste
pleasantly
bready
lightly
toasted
bit
of
spicy
bitterness
mellow
and
lightly
crisp
medium
with
a
solid
amount
of
lightly
sharp
fresh
carbonation
pretty
good
for
the
style
served
a
crisp
yellow
with
a
thin
diminishing
head
aroma
was
some
earthy
hops
slightly
overpowering
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
malts
and
crisp
hops
the
beer
is
light
crisp
and
very
summery
this
is
a
very
decent
pilsner
one
i
would
have
again
if
the
mood
hit
d
the
taste
more
than
makes
up
for
this
beers
unattractive
appearance
north
coast
did
a
very
nice
job
with
the
style
low
abv
makes
it
super
drinkable
i
would
happily
revisit
this
one
enjoyed
on
tap
at
mahaffeys
in
baltimore
hallertauer
and
tettnang
hops
that
impart
a
light
bitterness
that
feels
higher
creamy
easy
drinking
aboveaverage
for
the
style
nothing
to
look
at
neutral
aroma
fresh
crisp
but
a
bit
drying
abou
right
carbonation
this
started
out
well
a
very
goodlooking
beer
gold
thick
white
head
good
lacing
nice
floral
outdoorsy
aroma
the
taste
was
pretty
much
all
piney
hops
way
too
much
so
not
very
crisp
or
refreshing
ive
enjoyed
other
pilseners
more
my
wife
however
liked
this
beer
a
lot
pours
transparent
honeygold
with
an
inch
or
so
of
rapidly
dissolving
head
leaves
a
good
layer
of
foam
and
lacing
smells
grassy
and
a
bit
minty
with
an
unpleasant
metallic
coppery
edge
the
light
grainy
flavor
develops
into
honey
notes
in
the
center
finishes
with
restrained
hop
dryness
mint
and
copper
overtones

a
golden

really
nice
two

sticks
around
forever
the
aroma
is
slightly
floral

the
taste
is
a
touch
of
malt
with
some
faint

in
the
finish
overall
scrimshaw
pilsner
is
a
pretty
nice
thirst
quencher
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
worth
a
shot
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
with
a
somewhat
drying
finishbut
only
drying
to
the
bitter
receptors
of
the
palate
the
rest
of
the
mouth
is
left
quite
refreshed
and
quenched
the
beer
is
light
on
the
palate
with
spritzy
carbonation
this
is
one
ill
be
glad
to
buy
again
though
i
think
ill
try
to
get
my
hands
on
some
more
before
coming
back
to
this
one
overall
a
great
brew
one
you
should
not
pass
up
definitely
worth
a
try
however
it
is
not
going
to
be
my
house
pils
still
searching
for
that
perhaps
ill
give
prima
pils
a
second
try
a
very
smooth
drink
with
a
substantial
body
for
the
style
the
beer
has
nice
carbonation
and
superb
drinkability
what
can
be
said
very
drinkable
with
a
lower
abv
anytime
good
job
with
this
beer
top
shelf
quality
the
pour
is
clean
the
smell
is
clean
and
the
taste
follows
suit
accordingly
its
slightly
dry
in
the
finish
and
the
taste
itself
is
slightly
citrusy
and
that
of
very
light
malt
nothing
over
the
top
just
a
refreshing
beer
with
that
nice
carbonation
that
dances
a
bit
on
your
tongue
drinkable
but
seems
somewhat
off
cant
quite
place
it
i
felt
this
was
a
very
drinkable
beer
just
what
i
was
looking
for
on
this
warm
day
in
vegas
ill
enjoy
this
one
again
for
sure
md
almost
chewy
feel
in
the
mouth
medium
bodied
and
well
carbonated
one
of
the
better
pilseners
i
have
had
a
nice
beer
from
north
coast
this
is
a
very
nice
pilsner
beer
and
quite
a
bit
sweeter
and
more
medium
bodied
than
is
characteristic
for
the
style
the
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
slightly
frothy
head
that
does
retain
the
smell
is
a
very
typical
musty
lager
aroma
with
a
faint
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
quite
sweet
for
a
pilsner
there
is
a
lemony
citrus
flavor
to
this
beer
and
nice
biscuity
malt
base
some
slight
hop
tastes
in
the
finish
where
things
dry
out
a
bit
more
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
thin
and
insubstantial
and
i
knocked
the
beer
down
a
point
for
that
but
there
is
a
slight
creamy
mouthfeel
that
more
than
compensates
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
worth
seeking
out
lchaim
i
was
disappointed
by
this
one
overall
north
coast
generally
puts
out
some
good
to
very
good
stuff
and
the
scrimshaw
just
wasnt
up
to
par
with
that
or
with
the
best
from
within
the
style
it
just
blends
in
as
average
amongst
a
sea
of
pilsners
pours
a
bit
darker
than
any
average
pils
smells
of
red
apples
and
yeasty
background
with
malts
hops
actually
dominate
the
palate
with
a
grassy
style
but
not
completely
overwhelming
the
palate
the
malts
play
a
fairly
good
role
on
the
background
which
balances
the
beer
a
good
pils
the
taste
is
malty
through
the
drink
with
a
crisp
clean
finish
of
bitterness
of
the
hops
in
the
mouth
you
are
left
with
some
malt
on
the
tongue
one
of
the
better
american
pilsners
i
have
had
another
solid
effort
from
north
coast
scrimshaw
pilsner
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
with
a
nice
head
the
aroma
is
sweet
light
malt
and
some
graininess
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
smooth
with
a
nice
light
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
this
is
definitely
a
nice
session
beer
and
could
easily
be
a
training
wheels
beer
for
a
bmc
drinker
md
easy
drinking
lower
abv
makes
this
a
beer
that
i
can
make
a
session
does
not
have
the
typical
sharp
pils
feel
but
its
nice
none
the
less
mouthfeel
is
pretty
average
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
semicrisp
finish
see
this
all
the
time
at
the
store
and
have
never
tried
it
decided
to
finally
give
it
a
go
not
my
favorite
beer
from
north
coast
but
not
bad
for
its
style
might
drink
again
drinkability
an
nice
light
easy
drinking
beer
would
be
good
in
the
summer
or
a
warm
spring
day
low
abv
and
very
sessionable
i
got
two
bottles
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
pack
i
would
buy
this
again
the
scrimshaw
didnt
blow
me
away
as
i
said
it
was
simply
too
thin
in
the
taste
department
not
a
terrible
beer
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
poured
a
light
goldyellow
color
with
a
very
slight
haze
to
it
had
nice
white
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
aroma
is
of
grain
and
noble
hops
this
beer
is
malty
with
a
subtle
hop
flavor
and
delivers
a
crisp
clean
finish
lacing
on
glass
was
minimal
drinkability
was
quite
high
d
butter
these
are
too
easy
to
drink
quite
disappointed
by
this
north
coast
offering
in
short
it
poured
smelled
tasted
and
lingered
like
a
highlyadvertised
poorly
brewed
bmc
lager
grainy
nose
and
taste
with
few
redeeming
points
might
make
an
okay
thirst
quencher
if
served
very
cold
on
a
very
hot
day
but
i
doubt
that
ill
try
to
find
out
this
wasnt
bad
but
expect
a
smoother
less
hops
type
pilsner
drinkability
is
good
not
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
but
this
is
still
a
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
beer
will
have
to
revisit
this
one
when
the
heat
of
redding
returns
had
this
tonight
at
mellow
mushroom
good
pils
appearance
light
golden
moderate
head
retention
smells
a
little
hoppy
for
a
german
pils
flavors
are
good
light
creamy
but
as
mentioned
a
little
on
the
hoppy
side
for
me
i
like
this
beer
drank
well
for
a
german
pils
though
a
little
too
sticky
and
hoppy
and
not
creamy
and
malty
enough
side
by
side
with
a
paulaner
pils
for
example
will
explain
what
im
saying
notheless
a
highly
drinkable
session
beer
bottom
line
this
is
a
session
beer
very
drinkable
and
crisp
in
fact
i
drank
it
while
the
giants
beat
the
patriots
in
super
bowl
xlii
anyway
it
pours
a
clear
golden
color
smallmedium
head
with
a
small
amount
of
lace
good
carbonation
throughout
the
drink
which
made
it
very
drinkable
and
great
with
food
typical
pilsner
taste
perhaps
a
little
milder
but
definitely
worth
stocking
your
fridge
with
although
its
january
in
chicago
i
can
imagine
drinking
this
beer
in
junejuly
while
flipping
burgers
on
the
grill
definitely
buy
this
one
light
gold
pour
with
a
nice
thick
bright
white
head
and
significant
lacing
as
i
drink
smell
is
fresh
clean
slightly
malty
and
a
bit
more
hoppy
taste
is
smooth
clean
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
there
isnt
a
big
bitter
bite
like
in
a
lot
of
pilsners
but
it
is
simple
and
refreshing
a
touch
of
hops
and
sweetness
in
the
finish
a
great
easy
drinking
session
beer
i
really
like
this
one
even
though
its
not
exactly
what
id
expect
in
a
pilsner
little
to
no
malt
flavor
with
some
citrus
notes
that
quickly
fade
the
carbonic
bite
overpoweres
anything
else
that
might
be
here
almost
an
alkaseltzer
taste
on
the
finish
but
still
drinkable
very
high
dollar
for
the
beer
in
my
opinion
im
not
a
pils
guy
and
this
has
convinced
me
to
stay
of
that
persuassion
if
youre
thinking
of
this
one
you
can
get
a
miller
lite
for
25
of
the
money
a
decent
beer
that
would
be
alright
for
session
drinking
but
otherwise
unmemorable
if
this
was
ontap
id
view
it
as
a
safe
session
pitcher
to
share
with
less
adventurous
friends
edit
wow
this
really
is
pretty
good
reminds
me
a
lot
of
paulaner
pils
i
normally
dont
prefer
too
much
of
the
lighter
stuff
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
actually
its
smooth
and
even
and
extremely
drinkable
bottom
line
id
say
this
beer
is
more
of
the
kind
that
you
would
get
a
case
of
for
a
party
or
the
weekend
and
just
relax
and
drink
it
doesnt
have
the
type
of
characteristics
or
personality
that
would
make
it
a
unique
or
interesting
brew
to
check
out
d
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
very
filling
not
much
of
a
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
if
you
want
something
mild
however
i
normally
look
for
something
stronger
and
when
i
do
want
something
mild
i
typically
wont
for
a
beer
thats
as
pricy
as
this
one
tends
to
be
on
the
drinkability
scale
this
pilsner
scores
very
high
with
me
i
could
easily
settle
on
this
pint
after
pint
ive
already
recommended
it
to
my
friends
its
an
easy
drinking
pils
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
touch
more
hop
presence
but
not
bad
as
it
is
it
does
have
a
nice
refreshing
quality
to
it
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
with
small
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
for
the
most
part
but
leaves
a
small
amount
present
on
top
for
a
while
aroma
is
of
bready
malt
fruit
and
hops
which
are
citrusy
and
slightly
fruity
taste
is
slightly
sweet
at
the
front
quickly
giving
way
to
hops
the
hops
are
slightly
spicy
and
are
fairly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
it
is
an
easy
drinker
decent
pilsner
that
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
in
the
summer
feels
bubbly
and
fizzy
like
champagne
its
a
sipper
once
the
bubbles
go
away
it
feels
dry
not
an
amazing
beer
a
bit
simple
has
a
decent
flavor
with
some
frut
but
too
spiky
for
this
advocate
to
love
there
are
a
lot
of
great
beers
out
there
but
i
wouldnt
include
this
one
among
them
based
on
this
experience
not
recommended
quite
drinkable
good
beer
slightly
off
for
the
style
not
bitter
at
all
sweet
and
with
some
tealike
hop
flavor
the
hops
take
on
a
spicy
character
as
well
a
tasty
german
pils
i
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
at
one
of
the
local
beerporiums
and
i
definitely
dont
regret
it
it
poured
with
little
to
no
head
and
a
nice
dark
straw
color
and
smells
a
little
bready
with
a
hint
of
malts
the
flavor
is
very
smooth
with
a
little
malt
bite
but
very
little
bitterness
and
a
pleasantly
unobtrusive
aftertaste
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
with
a
very
pleasant
carbonation
and
if
it
fit
the
budget
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
one
all
night
not
exactly
fullbodied
and
flavorful
but
excels
in
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
a
nice
light
beer
perfect
for
a
relaxing
summer
day
pours
a
hazy
golden
sunshine
this
beer
smells
like
a
beer
its
a
beery
beer
smell
a
cross
between
miller
high
life
and
st
pauli
girl
tastes
a
little
creamier
and
fuller
than
a
european
pilsner
i
like
it
it
has
a
wide
mouthfeel
a
shot
of
hops
and
well
carbonated
if
you
like
the
north
coast
offerings
you
wont
be
dissapointed
with
this
one
quite
dry
with
a
crisp
carbonation
has
a
clean
finish
with
very
little
aftertaste
pretty
good
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
kind
of
a
departure
from
the
pils
im
used
to
but
its
not
bad
i
would
drink
it
again
but
probably
wont
buy
a
whole
sixer
drinkable
sure
not
enjoyable
but
drinkable
for
sure
a
servicable
german
style
pils
which
tastes
a
bit
like
an
ale
and
it
decent
but
there
are
better
examples
out
there
d
very
high
color
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
rather
like
a
typical
american
lager
not
impressive
aroma
is
remarkably
strong
overwhelmingly
malty
with
a
whisper
of
citrus
flavor
is
rich
malty
a
touch
of
lemon
or
lime
not
complex
but
very
nice
smooth
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
bite
it
is
a
refreshing
pilsener
to
be
balanced
just
perfectly
an
awesome
pilsner
ive
come
to
shy
away
from
pilsners
and
the
like
lately
but
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
cloudy
yelloworange
golden
color
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
that
has
lots
of
carbonation
rising
from
the
depths
of
the
glass
smell
is
primarily
malt
a
slight
sweetness
of
lighter
grains
and
subtle
hints
of
honey
and
a
slight
skunkiness
the
hopping
is
pretty
nondistinct
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
nose
with
the
difference
being
that
the
skunkiness
of
the
beer
is
much
more
pronounced
and
there
is
a
slight
hop
presence
in
the
form
of
a
finishing
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
dry
finish
and
slightly
mouth
burning
carbonation
drinkability
of
this
beer
is
hurt
by
the
skunkiness
i
suspect
that
the
single
beer
i
have
is
probably
far
past
the
best
by
date
although
since
there
isnt
a
date
on
the
bottle
its
hard
to
determine
overall
another
disappointing
pils
i
thought
something
was
missing
in
the
taste
though
i
know
pilsners
are
relatively
mild
as
they
are
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
beers
but
at
least
most
pilsners
have
more
hops
or
at
least
notes
of
something
else
that
separates
them
from
others
notes
of
citrus
and
grass
for
example
at
least
those
are
the
types
of
pilsners
im
drawn
to
drink
this
one
seemed
too
bland
for
my
tastes
perhaps
ive
been
spoiled
by
the
eagle
pride
pilsner
of
my
local
brewpub
and
other
solid
examples
i
must
be
more
of
a
traditional
pils
kind
of
guy
this
poured
up
a
golden
straw
colour
but
had
a
bit
of
chill
haze
to
it
and
actually
appeared
to
be
a
bit
cloudy
perhaps
it
was
just
the
chill
haze
smell
was
slightly
bready
with
some
very
mild
spicy
hop
aromas
everything
in
the
smell
was
very
gentle
and
mild
pleasant
taste
to
was
quite
mild
and
soft
and
the
nose
is

final
thoughts
a

beer

still
an
above

for
the
style
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
overall
drinkability
excellent
balance
for
a
pilsener
hits
all
the
right
notes
this
is
a
medium
to
lighter
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
balanced
crisp
and
refreshing
to
say
the
least
this
is
not
my
favorite
in
the
style
but
not
bad
by
any
stretch
i
would
drink
this
again
not
a
bad
beer
pours
smooth
and
golden
with
lots
of
bubbles
and
a
nice
head
that
dissipates
a
bit
too
quickly
i
liked
the
strong
carbonation
nice
and
dry
hops
are
noticeable
fore
sure
but
not
overpowering
a
bit
thinner
then
i
like
the
aroma
i
found
a
bit
looking
if
you
want
a
break
from
pretty
much
all
types
of
ales
and
are
looking
for
a
basic
crisp
lager
this
is
a
good
choice
for
some
reason
it
makes
me
think
of
a
beer
i
would
order
at
a
restaurant
would
probably
buy
again
othis
brew
is
a
decent
example
of
a
german
pils
as
noted
above
it
packs
a
bit
too
much
dry
malt
flavor
that
mostly
overwhelms
any
suggestion
of
hops
the
taste
is
so
dry
that
it
verges
on
metallic
and
grainy
and
while
that
is
sortof
what
i
expect
from
a
german
pils
a
little
more
hop
balance
or
sweetness
would
go
a
long
way
here
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
i
have
had
it
in
bottles
and
it
doesnt
compare
to
the
draft
version
definitly
a
much
better
on
tap
beer
the
flavor
starts
somewhat
on
the
light
side
but
builds
with
mild
malt
toastiness
and
subtle
spice
in
the
hop
flavor
as
it
increases
in
temperature
with
some
mild
yeast
flavor
and
herbal
hop
accents
which
have
a
slight
floral
edge
the
freshness
is
there
and
malt
is
not
too
mellow
and
the
hops
contribute
with
a
nice
balance
of
bitter
and
sweet
overall
i
was
not
sure
what
to
expect
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
with
the
flavor
and
drinkability
of
this
pils
refreshing
but
malt
is
more
substantial
and
hop
bitterness
less
present
than
in
a
pilsner
more
of
a
helles
really
theres
a
bit
of
diacetyl
that
surfaces
late
the
tang
was
a
bit
offputting
nice
lil
german
pils
thats
easy
to
get
on
this
side
of
the
pond
would
drink
again
wish
i
could
get
a
maß
of
this
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
the
drinkability
it
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
very
refreshing
after
you
have
a
sip
it
makes
you
want
more
overall
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
was
expecting
flavor
profile
is
unique
to
what
im
used
to
drinking
and
was
easily

i
will
be
buying
more
of
this

it

of

around

down
smell
is
of
grain
malt
and
some
cracker
and
bread
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
playdoh
aroma
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
with
some
herbal
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
but
nothing
too
great
in
my
opinion
taste
is
clean
and
smooth
malty
but
wellbalanced
with
a
light
kiss
of
hops
at
the
finish
a
delectable
and
enjoyable
pilsner
light
body
and
medium
carbonation
make
for
a
super
refreshing
drink
the
beer
is
very
clean
and
straightforward
i
have
never
seen
this
before
but
if
i
do
this
summer
i
will
be
grabbing
a
few
sixers
for
those
90
degree
saturdays
a
good
pilsner
crisp
tasty
and
refreshing
poured
into
a
glass
mug
pours
golden
with
a
dissipating
fluffy
white
head
plenty
of
bubbles
stream
to
the
top
indicating
plenty
of
carbonation
lacing
is
left
on
the
glass
as
you
drink
this
and
a
little
lacing
is
retained
at
the
top
well
into
the
consumption
of
this
beer
the
aroma
is
of
lightly
toasted
barley
malt
and
it
is
also
grassy
and
a
little
sweet
the
taste
is
bready
and
slightly
sweet
with
some
hop
bite
obviously
some
of
the
hop
character
and
other
flavors
have
likely
diminished
due
to
the
age
of
this
beer
but
i
can
still
taste
the
distinctive
characteristics
i
would
expect
from
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
this
is
well
carbonated
its
crisp
and
very
drinkable
this
is
very
easy
to
gulp
down
this
is
a
pleasing
pilsner
that
i
could
enjoy
on
a
summer
day
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
o
drinks
more
like
a
helles
than
a
pils
the
hop
bite
is
lacking
but
its
a
solid
beer
overall
i
have
to
lower
the
score
a
bit
though
due
to
the
fact
that
this
is
labeled
as
a
pilsner
and
not
helles
o
i
rarely
have
this
beer
im
beginning
to
question
why
this
one
is
above
average
very
good
next
time
i
go
finishing
im
taking
a
sixer
of
this
loved
the
appearancenice
clean
blonde
colorbut
rich
like
honey
even
the
smell
was
cleanno
skunk
just
breadhoney
and
a
little
crisp
hop
the
taste
was
the
samei
could
enjoy
this
beer
with
several
occassions
no
bitter
aftertastejust
wanting
to
repeat
the
sensation
loved
this
beer
o
i
like
the
sweetness
of
malts
however
i
do
like
them
more
bitter
all
in
all
not
bad
d
a
delicious
and
extremely
drinkable
german
pils
and
a
nice
change
after
stuffing
myself
with
oktoberfests
for
the
past
2
months
overall
paulaner
has
surprised
me
with
their
craftmanship
on
their
brews
this
beer
aint
the
exception
there
may
be
better
pilsners
out
there
but
paulaners
premium
pils
is
among
the
best
in
my
humble
opinion
and
it
is
also
by
the
book
on
how
the
style
should
be
pours
beautiful
golden
with
creamy
white
up
top
for
the
head
nose
has
some
herbal
notes
clean
and
a
trace
of
the
mischaracterized
skunk
oilyness
palate
offers
a
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
and
herbal
hop
quality
very
refreshing
easy
drinking
but
yet
also
sufficiently
flavorful
to
satisfy
notes
very
drinkable
at
4
9
abv
this
is
a
real
sessioner
and
a
beer
even
macro
drinkers
would
drink
this
is
another
quality
beer
from
munich
these
breweries
seem
very
confident
in
their
abilities
and
dont
seem
pushed
to
try
and
be
the
next
thing
in
beer
nice
overall
fine
and
refreshing
subtle
though
satisfying
this
was
a
very
nice
pilsener
very
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
overall
a
refreshing
pils
but
i
still
would
rather
buy
a
couple
other
6packs
of
pils
available
to
me
o
easy
drinking
refreshing
straight
forward
pilsner
great
on
a
hot
day
a
rather
sweet
pils
with
a
proper
clear
look
and
smaller
head
an
older
bottle
nose
of
straw
mild
apple
pie
yeast
and
pilsner
hopping
palate
is
sweet
and
the
dry
cut
is
not
as
brisk
as
would
be
expected
light
body
either
way
but
not
as
dry
as
the
bottle
would
have
one
thinking
with
the
extra
dry
comment
still
quite
drinkable
and
simple
palate
is
more
of
the
nose
but
with
an
unexpected
linger
of
malts
wont
deny
this
at
its
prime
probably
much
better
overall
an
outstanding
german
pilsner
i
am
blown
away
by
the
quality
here
an
absolute
favorite
pilsner
for
me
and
one
of
the
best
beers
from
germany
that
ive
yet
tried
prost
indeed
o
there
is
absolutely
nothing
exciting
about
this
beer
its
very
mediocre
big
malt
presence
doesnt
finish
as
dry
as
expected
but
still
good
nothing
outstanding
a
good
but
average
pils
bit
of
a
disappointment
here
was
expecting
a
less
malty
beverage
rjt
higher
carbonation
would
be
good
drinkability
another
great
session
beer
easy
to
drink
light
in
the
stomach
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
low
alcohol
content
makes
it
sessionable
like
the
review
says
a
good
pils
d
a
damn
good
pils
and
really
just
the
thing
to
drink
after
a
day
of
heavier
beers
and
rich
food
a
refreshing
and
light
pils
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
like
and
i
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
flavor
d
very
sessionable
flavors
are
balanced
and
price
is
fair
for
an
import
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
straw
color
with
little
head
the
smell
while
weak
does
smell
a
bit
offensive
there
was
initally
no
taste
but
finishs
dry
and
a
bit
like
ginger
ale
slightly
malty
taste
very
light
easy
to
drink
taste
overall
not
bad
light
but
has
a
very
dry
aftertaste
that
saves
it
i
generally
prefer
a
little
more
hop
bitterness
with
my
pilsner
but
this
south
german
interpretation
is
excellent
for
subtle
bitterness
while
their
are
many
domestic
pilsners
i
would
prefer
this
one
is
worth
seeking
out
atmosphere
is
pretty
decent
really
nice
appearance
with
a
giant
full
head
nose
is
nothing
special
but
typical
of
the
style
flavor
the
same
nothing
special
but
true
to
the
style
and
nice
clean
and
pure
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
quaff
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
basic
pilsener
with
a
lot
of
pilsener
malt
the
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
some
malt
and
grain
notes
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
very
basic
pours
a
straw
yellow
colour
with
nice
white
head
some
lacing
down
the
glass
very
light
smelling
some
grassy
hops
and
grains
this
is
very
balanced
and
pleasant
but
the
flavours
arent
exactly
exciting
me
either
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
from
the
malt
to
go
with
the
mild
bitterness
very
clean
flavour
carbonation
level
is
good
ddrinkability
is
stellar
of
course
as
most
pilsners
are
all
the
aspects
of
this
beer
come
together
well
enough
for
it
to
be
sessioned
for
as
long
as
ones
alcohol
tolerance
can
stand
nothing
at
all
wrong
with
this
beer
but
nothing
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
crowd
either
definitely
a
refreshing
beer
not
overly
complex
but
then
beers
of
this
style
typically
arent
mind
blowers
this
is
just
a
solid
beer
to
kick
back
with
incredibly
refreshing
and
a
good
taste
not
too
much
simple
and
satisfying
when
it
comes
to
clean
refreshing
lagers
the
germans
wrote
and
still
own
the
handbook
what
defines
their
brewing
scene
is
not
the
scorning
of
convention
but
the
perfection
of
it
while
many
north
american
drinkers
approach
a
beer
like
this
with
a
type
of
stoic
resignation
i
can
assure
you
that
to
have
it
in
its
native
land
is
something
memorable
d
goes
down
very
easy
nicely
blended
this
was
the
perfect
beer
on
a
warm
day
hanging
on
catalina
island
overall
its
good
but
nothing
here
really
impressed
me
i
think
ill
pass
on
this
one
in
the
future
d
i
could
do
away
with
der
wasser
serving
type
bottle
d
easy
enough
to
drink
would
have
posted
higher
if
not
so
bitter
drinkability
overall
this
is
good
if
a
bit
basic
its
quite
drinkable
and
has
an
authentic
flavor
i
thought
this
one
drank
very
easy
a
good
alternative
for
your
bmc
crowd
a
bit
mild
but
that
is
ok
still
very
decent
and
worthy
of
trying
medium
to
light
body
fair
carbonation
and
a
slick
mouthfeel
drinkability
is
high
md
this
has
a
pretty
standard
characteristic
mouthfeel
not
overly
carbonated
or
underso
nor
is
it
too
thick
or
thin
paulaner
has
this
balanced
nicely
the
finish
is
somewhat
drying
not
a
big
surprise
that
it
would
be
dry
to
at
least
some
extent
since
it
does
read
extra
dry
on
the
label
if
this
was
a
bit
hoppier
i
imagine
this
would
be
more
drinkable
but
without
a
definitive
grassy
character
i
am
having
a
little
trouble
at
getting
excited
about
this
one
a
good
very
dry
pilsner
as
advertised
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
smells
very
slightly
of
sulfur
and
malt
taste
is
a
dry
cracker
like
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
by
a
yeasty
middle
and
a
nice
earthy
bitterness
in
the
finish
very
nice
bitterness
levels
that
balance
out
with
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
carbonation
super
drinkable
this
is
a
great
german
pilsner
the
sample
i
had
was
very
fresh
and
that
no
doubt
makes
a
difference
i
would
buy
it
again
body
is
good
medium
with
nice
carbonation
tastes
a
little
more
than
it
smells
has
some
subdued
malts
and
sour
hops
doesnt
taste
fresh
it
has
kind
of
that
stale
feeling
the
flavor
just
kinda
rolls
off
your
tongue
and
into
your
throat
with
a
sort
of
nothingness
it
actually
has
a
nice
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
with
nice
burp
taste
but
on
the
tongue
its
pretty
unappealing
but
overall
this
is
about
as
unrobust
as
a
pils
gets
could
be
the
age
i
will
try
to
rereview
when
i
get
a
fresher
bottle
easily
drinkable
with
a
great
mix
of
hoppy
bitterness
and
sizzle
from
carbonation
it
seems
that
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
because
of
its
satisfying
nature
then
again
i
did
just
mow
the
lawn
in
100
heat
and
maybe
i
was
looking
for
a
cool
refreshing
drink
either
way
im
going
to
have
some
more
and
go
to
bed
early
this
is
a
good
brew
and
certainly
a
step
up
from
the
macro
attempt
at
real
pilsener
taste
perhaps
this
would
be
a
good
gateway
beer
before
introducing
a
newbie
to
say
prima
overall
a
very
decent
pilsener
i
am
partial
a
bit
to
some
of
the
american
versions
with
a
little
extra
hoppiness
but
this
is
only
just
a
notch
below
some
of
my
favorites
i
sadly
overlooked
this
beer
for
quite
some
time
drinkability
is
better
than
just
ok
this
beer
isnt
bad
nor
really
good
it
middles
itself
throughout
the
glass
its
another
one
of
those
much
better
than
a
bmc
especially
on
a
hot
day
d
i
can
slam
these
not
filling
some
other
pilsners
you
will
find
tastes
very
well
balanced
yet
the
flavors
are
all
pretty
light
biscuit
malt
with
a
dash
of
black
pepper
and
herbal
notes
a
slight
zing
to
it
from
the
hops
gives
it
a
refreshing
finish
overall
this
beer
is
great
to
drink
would
like
to
see
it
a
smidge
more
dry
in
the
end
but
thats
just
me
a
beer
that
is
1
year
4
months
old
shouldnt
be
that
bad
but
im
guessing
its
age
is
a
contributing
factor
o
paragon
of
the
style
and
an
awesome
outdoor
beer
gonna
see
this
one
again
with
the
summer
months
coming
up
d
i
had
this
back
to
back
with
paulaner
original
muncher
and
found
this
to
be
the
more
interesting
of
the
two
the
low
abv
and
light
flavor
make
this
an
extremely
easy
to
consume
beer
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
concise
its
a
very
focused
beer
you
can
drink
this
without
being
distracted
by
ubercomplexity
but
this
still
remains
a
work
of
art
it
feels
very
light
on
the
tongue
and
goes
down
very
nice
high
drinkability
due
to
a
low
abv
and
such
clarity
in
regards
to
flavor
and
scent
throughout
the
beer
i
really
love
this
pils
this
is
a
decent
pale
lager
and
it
definitely
beats
bmc
macro
lagers
if
i
could
put
them
against
each
other
in
general
beers
of
this
style
i
find
to
be
a
little
uninspiring
for
the
style
this
is
pretty
good
mouthfeel
is
more
rounded
than
the
other
german
pilsners
i
tried
along
side
this
one
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
an
equal
amount
of
sharp
floral
hop
character
taste
is
again
grainy
malt
with
hop
bitterness
but
it
seems
slightly
faint
and
watery
clean
dry
finish
medium
palate
with
good
carbonation
this
was
pretty
good
but
there
are
definitely
better
german
pils
out
there
good
session
beer
d
this
is
a
real
pilsener
very
crisp
clean
and
offers
true
drinkablility
great
to
go
with
a
hot
louisiana
summer
and
spring
and
fall
for
that
matter
after
running
or
mowing
the
lawn
overall
impression
if
you
are
looking
for
an
extremely
light
pils
pick
up
a
six
pack
it
would
be
the
perfect
beer
for
playing
a
round
of
golf
or
to
pair
with
light
salads
pretzels
or
or
other
salty
bar
snacks
its
extremely
thirst
quenching
and
a
definite
quaffer
in
my
book
definitely
a
quaffer
a
minor
sticking
point
is
that
the
carbonation
dies
towards
the
end
of
the
glass
i
could
drink
a
six
pack
and
not
even
blink
picked
up
a
6er
at
cellars
in
woodbury
poured
a
straw
yellow
with
a
tall
white
head
the
aroma
and
flavor
have
a
great
mix
of
spicy
fruity
hops
with
dry
bready
malts
and
hard
water
this
is
a
classic
pilsner
through
and
through
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
a
must
try
poured
a
slightly
cloudy
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
dropped
quickly
very
faint
aroma
of
mown
grass
competing
with
co2
nose
buzz
taste
is
smooth
and
underwhelming
with
a
slight
bitter
bite
at
the
end
a
good
cold
and
refreshing
beer
a
euro
macro
essentialy
solid
but
unremarkable
no
skunk
whatsoever
been
on
a
bit
of
a
pils
kick
lately
a
quick
burst
of
carbonation
upon
the
pour
leads
to
a
twofinger
airy
white
head
retention
is
good
and
a
sinewy
lacing
is
left
behind
color
is
a
clear
golden
straw
smells
a
bit
vegetal
and
floral
with
some
grain
and
sweets
in
the
back
tastes
grassy
and
hoppy
with
that
good
pils
crispness
that
we
all
love
this
beer
has
true
and
exceptional
drinkability
and
not
the
kind
that
confuses
drinkability
will
lack
of
taste
golden
straw
colored
the
head
is
thick
frothy
and
leaves
tons
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
clean
with
grass
and
hay
lovely
mix
of
flavors
in
the
taste
floral
hops
upfront
this
gives
way
to
the
dominant
pale
malt
sweetness
and
honey
notes
bits
of
butter
the
hops
pick
up
where
they
left
off
in
the
finish
with
a
mild
finish
good
and
refreshing
d
a
solid
pils
for
me
theres
prima
pils
and
then
everything
else
so
perhaps
i
am
being
a
tab
biased
this
is
a
good
one
i
just
prefer
a
bit
more
flavor
great
beer
for
those
transitioning
from
bmc
dvery
good
i
sampled
this
wtwo
other
pils
and
this
was
by
far
the
best
of
the
3
bottle
golden
colored
and
poured
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
slowly
tapers

mostly
grassy
with
a
touch
of
fruity
hops
it
starts
with
a
hint
of
bready
malts
then
onto
a
suprisingly
nice
gradual
bitter
dry
hoppiness
very
clean
and
refreshing
simple
but
good
apples
are
all
over
this
beer
lots
of
apples
in
the
aroma
mixed
with
some
orangeyhoney
tinges
all
of
which
are
very
present
in
the
taste
quite
attractive
in
the
glass
nice
and
bright
strawyellow
tones
topped
by
a
very
white
light
head
that
bubbles
happily
some
malt
but
hops
are
up
front
and
center
light
body
and
decent
bite
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
tried
and
quite
reasonable
in
price
would
go
quite
well
with
spicy
food
mouthfeel
drinkability
average
mouthfeel
with
good
drinkability
very
good
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
possesses
some
pretty
good
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
grainy
malt
with
a
good
dose
of
spicy
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
malt
with
a
nice
snappy
bite
from
the
spicy
saaz
hops
in
the
finish
the
taste
is
crisp
and
refreshing
everything
you
expect
in
a
good
german
pils
this
beer
is
nothing
that
is
going
to
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
is
definitely
a
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
pilsner
that
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
in
the
summer
recommended
standard
mouthfeel
semidry
finish
really
drinkable
an
absolute
standard
of
what
an
old
school
german
pils
is
pours
out
a
nice
pale
golden
staw
color
clear
light
bubbles
this
pils
has
produces
and
holds
a
nice
two
finger
head
aromas
of
hallertau
pale
straw
grassy
and
if
youve
ever
been
therepure
bavarian
water
its
hard
to
describe
but
if
youve
ever
experienced
that
smell
here
it
is
flavors
are
light
and
crisp
pilsner
yeast
hops
bready
mouthfeel
is
light
abv
is
low
this
is
a
truely
drinkable
beer
absolute
pilsner
standard
a
very
solid
pilsner
with
no
obvious
sign
of
flaws
opens
with
a
bright
straw
color
fair
head
formation
and
retention
could
be
bolder
aromas
of
wellattenuated
malts
and
a
profound
grassy
herbal
hop
scent
the
malt
flavor
is
very
bold
and
rich
for
a
pils
but
low
on
sweetness
makes
it
very
drinkable
some
hop
flavor
grassy
comes
through
at
midpalate
and
rides
into
the
finish
light
apples
come
from
the
grains
and
spices
from
the
yeast
give
enough
roundness
and
variety
to
keep
the
beer
from
becomming
dull
medium
round
texture
with
a
creaminess
upfront
but
thinning
late
hop
dryness
and
bitterness
linger
in
the
throat
and
proves
palate
cleansing
certainly
one
of
the
better
pilsners
out
there
d
this
has
pretty
middle
of
the
road
drinkability
it
is
refreshing
and
tastes
okay
but
as
a
package
there
are
too
many
other
beers
that
i
would
rather
have
to
rank
this
any
better
than
average
one
of
my
absolute
favorite
beers
id
love
to
find
this
ontap
somewhere
close
excellent
drinkability
always
a
good
choice
when
i
want
a
pilsner
strong
but
creamy
impression
from
the
carbonation
moderate
body
for
style
excellent
standby
on
the
quest
for
the
perfect
pils
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
is
certainly
drinkable
but
doesnt
knock
your
socks
off
not
bad
not
great
d
reasonable
drinkability
overall
it
is
a
well
balanced
and
stylistically
accurate
pils
but
the
hop
and
malt
character
are
both
a
bit
subdued
d
very
nothing
to
put
you
off
here
i
would
like
to
try
one
that
is
fresher
as
this
bottle
was
made
about
9
months
ago
d
great
example
of
pilsener
not
my
style
but
still
an
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
medium
golden
straw
color
with
a
less
intense
head
than
expected
just
a
covering
of
big
bubbles
and
good
lace
on
the
side
a
very
clean
aroma
overall
some
light
graham
like
aromas
sweet
biscuity
malts
just
a
touch
of
hops
but
i
imagine
age
has
hurt
this
department
it
starts
sweet
on
the
palate
with
the
light
malts
coating
the
mouth
incredibly
clean
with
a
very
crisp
finish
i
also
taste
some
faint
spicy
hops
towards
the
end
probably
hallertaus
an
enjoyable
pils
but
one
i
would
like
to
try
fresher
fluffy
white
head
with
nice
retention
and
lacing
on
top
of
a
golden
straw
body
aromas
of
spicy
hops
and
gently
malts
along
with
a
hint
of
apples
flavor
is
quite
mild
spicy
hops
are
enjoyable
as
is
the
bitterness
malts
provide
enough
to
hold
the
beer
together
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
light
overall
quite
enjoyable
but
just
not
enough
flavor
to
keep
drinking
nothing
offensive
about
this
one
though
all
in
all
a
great
beer
that
you
can
enjoy
any
day
i
absolutely
loved
it
needs
more
carbonation
though
this
stlye
of
beer
fits
well
into
my
lifestyle
with
its
character
and
ability
to
go
with
dinner
or
as
a
simple
refreshing
easy
drinking
lawnmower
beer
i
will
recommend
this
to
a
few
of
my
buddies
who
enjoy
this
style
i
ended
up
staggering
around
a
bit
i
am
glad
i
didnt
have
yet
another
they
are
so
drinkable
you
forget
that
it
will
do
you
in
then
again
i
did
get
a
free
shot
of
patron
from
the
barkeep
it
pays
to
tip
nicely
maybe
it
was
the
patron
or
maybe
not
but
the
paulaner
smelled
very
good
and
went
down
easy
this
has
a
little
bit
of
pepper
in
the
taste
otherwise
it
is
straight
up
pils
very
light
heavy
carbonation
and
crisp
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
and
with
the
low
abv
very
sessionable
overall
a
very
tasty
and
easy
drinking
pils
drinkability
a
nice
refreshing
pilsner
that
would
be
great
on
a
warm
day
low
abv
good
taste
light
bodied
all
make
this
a
definite
session
beer
i
wish
i
could
get
a
true
pilsner
like
this
from
the
big
3
fresh
inexpensive
good
lager
thierry

wow
paulaner
has
long
been
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
but
id
never
tried
their
pils
before
my
loss
its
very
good
comment
i
will
stay
away
from
this
pilsener
in
the
future
d
exceptional
drinkability
this
was
just
what
i
needed
on
a
hot
summer
night
it
would
be
a
great
choice
for
all
occasions
in
which
you
need
an
easydrinking
tasty
beer
paulaner
premium
pils
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
are
some
grassy
smells
in
the
aroma
but
primarily
it
smells
like
malt
malt
is
pretty
strong
in
this
one
the
hops
come
in
toward
the
end
the
taste
is
pretty
much
dead
on
for
the
style
maybe
not
my
favorite
german
pils
but
definitely
pretty
good
and
definitely
worth
a
try
poured
a
light
yellow
color
with
decent
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
but
left
decent
lacing
on
my
glass
aroma
was
lightly
floral
without
any
trace
of
skunk
the
body
being
very
light
makes
it
a
nice
session
beer
or
a
nice
choice
on
a
hot
day
flavor
is
a
little
grassy
with
a
very
slight
citrus
taste
a
good
refresher
pilsners
are
generally
not
rated
very
highly
because
they
are
not
terribly
complex
but
for
easy
drinking
they
are
hard
to
beat
this
is
a
good
easy
drinking
traditional
german
pils
the
brewers
at
paulaner
seem
to
click
with
each
lager
style
they
churn
out
this
was
my
first
premium
pils
paulaner
that
ive
tried
ive
been
a
fan
of
this
brewer
for
many
years
especially
of
salvator
and
the
hefeweiss
but
whereas
salvator
is
a
great
beefy
wintery
beer
the
pils
is
the
perfect
compliment
to
a
warm
summer
day
if
you
like
the
hefe
id
definitely
say
youd
wanna
give
the
pils
a
fair
shake
id
like
to
try
a
tap
version
of
this
sometime
notes
this
was
an
incredibly
fresh
six
pack
and
tasted
just
as
i
remember
having
at
my
favorite
pub
in
bitburg
germany
good
distribution
is
something
to
applaud
not
a
bad
pils
with
nice
flavors
of
fresh
hay
herbal
hops
and
characteristic
german
yeast
recommended
for
the
style
which
while
not
my
favorite
is
extremely
refreshing
at
the
right
time
zum
wohl
drinkability
is
exceptional
it
couldnt
be
better
refreshing
and
uncomplicated
but
still
a
quality
beer
damn
near
perfect
as
session
material
not
my
cup
of
tea
for
a
pilsner
it
has
too
many
of
the
bland
flavors
i
associate
with
the
american
macros
this
is
one
of
the
better
of
the
pilsners
anywhere
appearance
might
not
be
the
best
but
the
aroma
and
especially
flavor
and
mouthfeel
are
superb
this
one
poured
witih
a
slight
head
and
no
lace
a
slightly
hazy
light
amber
color
aroma
is
a
very
fragrant
hop
with
light
malts
flavors
the
same
a
crisp
beer
excellent
body
just
want
to
drink
more
very
balanced
a
premier
session
beer
bitter
sweet
finish
methinks
the
warnings
should
be
replaced
with
a
more
positive
pitch
and
the
average
aussie
bloke
given
the
chance
to
experience
what
pilseners
lagers
should
really
taste
like
12
oz
bottle
color
of
golden
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
nose
of
hay
grass
mild
hopps
melons
and
grains

taste
of
grain
hay
grassy
malt
and
slight
bitter
hops
body
light
crisp
and
mildly
carbonated

aftertaste
of
slight
sweetness
and
low
acidity
overall
a
highly
enjoyeable
go
to
pils
with
very
few
flaws
brilliant
golden
color
with
champagne
bubbles
but
a
notsofrothy
head
the
nose
is
grassy
and
quite
fragrant
with
noticable
hops
the
taste
is
hugely
refreshing
and
pleasantly
buttery
with
a
slightly
metallic
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
can
be
characterized
in
the
same
way
really
smooth
until
the
very
end
the
finish
however
metallic
is
very
dry
and
crisp
drinkable
as
hell
d
terrible
this
is
overly
salty
and
metallic
i
can
barely
finish
this
one
i
will
though
i
dont
believe
in
wasting
beer
there
are
thirsty
kids
in
china
and
my
mom
taught
me
to
always
clean
my
plate
overall
i
think
this
is
an
ok
german
pilsner
its
generally
quite
average
but
its
really
quite
drinkable
and
theres
no
major
complaints
about
it
nothing
skunky
here
either
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
but
if
i
didnt
have
better
choices
available
id
probably
get
this
somewhat
often
mouthfeel
was
smooth
yet
somewhat
zesty
body
was
thin
to
medium
i
enjoyed
this
one
more
than
i
anticipated
pours
out
a
pale
golden
color
with
tons
of
dancing
bubbles
in
the
body
thick
frothy
head
and
rings
of
sheet
lacing
aroma
is
a
mix
of
clean
pale
malts
grassy
and
haylike
hops
and
a
slight
sulfur
hit
flavor
is
malty
and
bready
with
some
of
those
earthy
hops
thrown
in
the
mix
finishes
extremely
dry
the
hop
bitterness
seems
to
fall
flat
in
the
end
and
doesnt
contribute
a
bright
punch
like
id
hoped
mouthfeel
is
light
however
there
needs
to
be
more
carbonation
in
this
one
although
this
isnt
jawdropping
its
incredibly
drinkable
like
most
halfdecent
lagers
this
beer
had
a
nice
thick
head
the
smell
was
a
little
citrusy
the
taste
was
not
very
hoppy
but
smooth
and
balanced
it
was
easy
to
drink
and
highly
sessionable
it
had
a
nice
crispness
if
i
wanted
to
just
chill
with
my
friends
and
have
a
great
beer
that
i
didnt
have
to
think
about
too
much
i
would
consider
this
beer
poured
this
into
a
pilsner
glass
small
head
though
nice
carbonation
pale
yellow
color
head
has
a
pleasant
aroma
to
it
tastes
pretty
ordinary
to
me
nothing
stands
out
in
any
way
pretty
standard
though
not
bad
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
for
me
very
boring
and
overpriced
drinkabilitythis
is
a
good
pilsneri
could
easily
have
a
quite
a
few
of
these
bottle
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
nice
large
longlasting
head
has
a
malty
grassy
slightly
grainy
aroma
the
flavor
is
sweet
malty
with
grassy
hints
also
some
grainy
hints
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
long
bitter
aftertaste
an
okay
german
pilsener
overall
run
of
the
mill
stuff
but
pretty
good
nonetheless
d
all
pilsners
are
very
drinkable
and
this
is
one
is
no
exception
a
nice
beer
that
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pils
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
i
havent
had
this
good
of
a
pils
since
i
was
in
austria
early
this
year
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
frothy
white
head
aroma
of
floral
hops
and
malt
thin
soft
mouthfeel
this
pils
is
crips
and
fulfilling
bready
sweet
malt
flavor
with
a
nice
assertive
bitterness
compliments
of
the
hallertauer
hops
the
finish
is
dry
classic
german
pils
if
youre
going
to
stock
your
fridge
with
a
pilsner
beer
this
might
as
well
be
the
one
paulaner
premium
pils
although
it
isnt
what
id
call
a
lackluster
version
isnt
up
to
snuff
compared
to
some
of
the
other
classic
german
pilseners
its
still
drinkable
though
and
is
crisp
and
refreshing
enough
to
warrant
a
purchase
for
those
with
an
affinity
for
the
style
d
it
is
a
pretty
good
german
pilsner
although
i
like
some
other
paulaner
products
much
better
cavat
i
have
discribed
this
beer
as
missing
something
yet
still
have
it
rated
well
how
does
this
work
german
pilser
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
so
while
i
may
find
it
lacking
compared
to
the
spaten
it
was
still
one
of
the
better
offerings
out
there
a
good
german
pils
with
obvious
flaws
a
great
session
beer
even
if
its
not
all
that
exciting
overall
really
wish
the
taste
lived
up
to
the
smell
love
the
aroma
but
not
too
enamored
by
the
flavor
traditional
paulaner
aroma
with
a
hint
of
toasted
malts
comes
from
a
thin
straw
brew
it
isnt
tasteless
but
doesnt
really
have
a
distinct
flavor
other
than
a
sharp
tinge
when
you
first
swallow
this
is
a
crisp
light
lager
that
is
what
budweiser
tries
to
mimic
that
being
said
it
makes
me
think
of
cheap
tasteless
brew
that
leaves
one
wanting
ok
beer
not
worth
the
import
price
overall
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
pils
ive
had
its
less
rich
than
spaten
konig
or
pils
urquell
i
find
it
very
clean
and
dry
on
the
finish
good
brew
this
a
pale
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
bright
white
head
the
aroma
is
beautiful
a
soft
cloud
of
muted
hop
and
sweet
grain
unadulterated
by
any
sulfer
notes
the
main
word
to
describe
this
beer
is
soft
everything
is
so
subtle
and
balanced
the
flavor
is
light
sweet
a
little
bready
with
touches
of
alcohol
metal
and
sulfer
which
all
have
their
place
and
are
balanced
in
their
own
way
totally
clean
aftertaste
though
the
finish
is
unabrupt
not
perfect
but
a
pretty
dreamy
pilsner
crisp
clear
and
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
about
3
fingers
that
disappeared
fast
strong
grain
breadlike
aroma
lost
of
malt
flavors
but
not
sweet
or
syrupy
defiantly
enough
hop
to
balance
things
out
but
that
is
about
all
the
hops
do
as
they
do
not
stand
out
tremendously
aside
from
providing
a
dry
ending
very
palatable
but
not
at
all
challenging
a
good
example
of
a
pills
but
not
the
plutonic
form
overall
i
really
liked
this
this
fine
german
pilsner
all
thats
missing
is
a
little
more
saaz
aroma
final
thought
pils
is
my
prefered
style
but
this
one
falls
short
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
decent
brew
but
aside
from
its
appearance
it
is
marginally
better
than
average
paulaner
did
bad
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
clean
but
sweet
with
little
hops
it
has
a
very
refreshing
flavor
a
decent
malty
backbone
with
a
sweet
grassy
finish
and
a
little
bitterness
from
the
hops
i
wish
american
pilseners
were
this
good
drinkability
as
has
been
mentioned
by
other
reviewers
this
would
make
a
good
intro
into
foreign
pils
varieties
as
opposed
to
the
american
macro
pils
light
brassy

clean

one
of
the
better
german
pilseners
ive
had
so
far
recommended
poured
a

with
a
pillowy

with

into
a
traditional

bready
pilsener

slight

too
clean
tasting
with
some

husky
sweetness
at
the
beginning
and
an
even
transition
to
the
light
hoppy
dry
finish
nothing
thats
reinventing
the
wheel
just
a
good
pilsener
very
drinkable
due
to
its
dry
finish
this
is
another
good
european
pilsener
to
check
out
comments
it
puts
heine
to
shame
thats
for
sure
good
stuff
some
domestically
united
states
produced
beers
might
top
it
due
to
being
fresher
i
definitely
recommend
this
one
taste
is
very
crisp
and
clean
with
a
slight
hop
bite
light
and
airy
the
label
reads
that
this
beer
is
extra
dry
and
its
true
dry
finish
very
drinkable
and
a
perfect
transition
beer
for
individuals
that
are
faithful
to
the
macro
beer
scene
very
smooth
on
the
tongue
and
down
the
throat
starts
dry
gives
a
sweet
tingle
at
the
back
extraordinarily
lightbodied
without
being
simple
or
lacking
in
flavor
just
enough
taste
on
the
palate
to
make
each
sip
beckon
the
next
very
nice
lager
indeed
im
not
the
biggest
fan
of
this
style
but
its
an
excellent
example
and
i
can
see
it
come
in
especially
handy
when
thirstquenchin
is
the
order
of
the
day
light
and
crisp
not
the
most
exciting
or
memorable
pils
but
its
a
good
session
beer
on
a
hot
day
subtle
but
not
subdued
the
bight
of
carbonation
ushers
in
the
hops
to
the
forefront
combining
to
a
crescendo
of
dry
toasted
malt
with
a
pinch
of
hops
for
a
most
pleasant
and
refreshing
brew
joey
while
the
munich
lager
was
malty
and
had
a
decent
hop
presence
this
beer
seems
a
bit
superior
in
both
departments
this
could
be
considered
the
premium
of
the
two
i
know
they
are
technically
different
styles
this
one
a
german
pils
and
the
other
a
münchner
helles
the
similarities
are
there
this
a
nicely
balanced
pils
that
is
high
in
drinkability
the
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
smells
of
pale
and
wheat
malts
its
light
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
smooth
with
a
wheat
zing
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
it
drinks
very
well
this
is
one
of
the
better
pils
ive
had

i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
pilsner
which
is
not
a
style
that
i
usually
enjoy
the
bottle
says
extra
dry
which
i
will
agree
with
to
a
point
the
finish
definitely
has
a
dry

it

than

an
enjoyable
german
pilsner
its
a
bit
grainy
but
other
than
that
hits
all
of
the
style
notes
a
good
clean
pilsner
just
not
my
favorite
style
meh
just
tastes
like
a
more
full
bodied
version
of
the
stuff
i
drank
in
college
presentation
packaged
in
a
stubby
twelveounce
brown
glass
bottle
with
a
pryoff
crown
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
clear
pale
yellow
with
white
head
not
much
in
the
aroma
nothing
that
stands
out
tastes
like
what
one
would
expect
from
a
pilsner
goes
down
easy
overall
this
beer
is
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
especially
on
a
hot
day
but
would
not
necessarily
seek
it
out
overall
a
stellar
pilsener
with
nice
flavor
easy
drinking
for
sure
nice
malt
to
hop
blending
great
pils
a
clear
light
gold
with
a
dense
eggshell
white
head
choppy
and
with
plenty
of
lace
this
looks
great
the
nose
is
solid
bright
snappy
doughy
lemonya
touch
dusty
and
with
an
intense
hop
oil
and
a
ltitle
bit
of
soap
the
palate
opens
rather
intensely
bitter
with
a
blend
of
mint
lemon
peel
fresh
herbs
and
some
soap
dough
honey
a
little
bread
appear
on
the
mid
palate
before
a
long
bitter
and
lemony
finish
take
over
soapy
again
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
pleasant
on
the
palate
crisp
carbonation
keeps
this
snappy
and
the
combination
of
hop
oils
and
bitterness
is
enjoyable
though
not
in
the
sense
that
the
classics
are
final
thoughts
this
is
my
first
sierra
nevada
beer
and
to
be
honest
im
shocked
at
how
well
this
brewery
is
regarded
because
this
was
a
big
disappointment
i
guess
you
cant
judge
a
beer
by
one
offering
but
this
was
not
one
that
i
can
recomend
im
a
huge
from
the
12
oz
bottle
into
a
proper
pilsner
glass
its
an
attractive
golden
clear
color
with
a
thick
white
head
of
tight
bubbles
that
fades
at
a
moderate
pace
leaving
a
small
amount
of
sticky
lacing
and
a
thin
capcollar
decent
precipitating
carbonation
nose
is
bready
and
a
bit
sweet
in
the
mouth
not
too
bubbly
but
certainly
crisp
smooth
and
quenching
taste
is
bready
malted
barley
nicely
balanced
against
hops
clean
finish
overall
a
pretty
solid
pilsner
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
decent
would
try
again
so
good
grassy
grainy
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
end
that
dissipates
quickly
id
definitely
get
this
again
i
hope
to
try
it
on
tap
some
day
overall
i
think
sn
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
with
this
one
its
pretty
much
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
pilsner
a
full
range
of
flavors
from
the
light
but
important
malt
base
to
the
classic
pilsner
hops
finish
and
an
overall
lightness
that
goes
down

great

a
gem
when
judged
as
a
flavorful
somewhat
light
lager
this
is
the
real
deal
and
delivers
a
classic
beer
drinking
experience
i
had
this
the
same
day
with
two
other
pilsners
i
really
like
and
respect
and
nooner
beat
them
both
im
not
being
too
picky
about
german
pilsner
being
the
benchmark
for
this
since
it
is
better
than
any
german
pilsner
i
have
had
its
just
a
damn
good
lager
beer
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
just
a
tiny
bit
off
on
color
and
clarity
a
bit
more
citrusy
than
id
expect
for
a
pils
as
well
but
a
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
lager
that
i
expect
to
revisit
often
once
summer
arrives
reminds
me
of
budweiser
or
miller
light
it
is
a
german
style
pilsner
though
as
advertised
just
didnt
think
id
hate
it
as
much
as
i
do
overall
very
tasty
beer
great
presentation
of
the
style
overall
a
truly
classic
highly
drinkable
pilsener
great
job
as
usual
sn
labeled
as

it
tastes

this
is
a
flavorful
pilsner
i
would
have
no
trouble
with
starting
to
drink
this
at
noon
and
going
all
day
this
could
probably
be
considered
a
good
west
coast
version
of
a
pilsener
it
is
perhaps
a
little
more
citrusypiney
than
the
average
pilsener
out
there
but
well
within
the
range
of
the
style
i
find
most
if
not
all
of
this
brewerys
beers
to
be
good
values

think
i
paid

hoppy

for

as
if

lingers
somethin
fierce
not
a
bad
thing
just
seems
a
bit
confused
stuck
between
two
worlds
like
a
tranny
of
beers
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
would
score
a
20
in
a
competition
because
of
what
its
being
called
german
lagers
arent
made
with
loads
of
piney
citrusy
cascade
i
really
like
the
beer

it

im
not
a
big
fan
of

in
general
but
i
must
admit
that
this
is
one
tasty
brew
o
nice
interpretation
of
a
german
pilsner
a
style
ive
grown
to
love
over
the
years
this
doesnt
quite
measure
up
to
some
of
the
authentic

ones

is

its

would

overall
a

the
flavor
is
very
biting
with
lots
of
bittering
hop
long
lasting
aftertaste
this
seems
to
be
off
style
for
me
its
missing
the
pilsner
malt
flavor
up
front
and
the
hop
is
too
dominating
the
body
and
carbonation
though
are
spot
on
its
a
nice
looking

with
a
big
foamy
white
head
atop

liquid
that
was
the
peak
of
the

the

was

had

it

this
one
i
would
buy
this
brew
again
overall
im
giving
nooner
pilsner
a
4
5
out
of
5
worth
seeking
out
great
crisp
easy
drinkin
pils
trying
it
in
feb
is
a
little
weird
to
say
it
is
a
perfect
poolbeach
beer
bottle
of
nooner
pils
drank
o
the
taste
really
makes
up
for
some
of
the
other
shortcomings
this
is
a
great
beer
for
a
party
or
summer
activity
or
watching
tv
brew
pours
a
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
for
the
most
part
lacing
is
seen
when
sipped
at
the
line
atthe
top
of
the
brew
was
for
the
most
part
the
aroma
is
mostly
of
grains
and
hops
pretty
much
is
said
for
the
finish
also
with
some
floral
hops
that
is
slightly
bitter
for
the
finish
also
the
finish
is
on
the
dry
side
mediumbodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
was
ok
but
nothing
really
special
o
a
lovely
beer
i
would
like
to
see
a
touch
more
hop
flavor
and
the
bitterness
evened
out
a
little
bit
but
overall
a
very
enjoyable
beer
overall
this
was
a
great
beer
i
have
no
complaints
serving
type
bottle
pilsners
are
never
rated
highly
rating
by
style
im
rating
it
high
so
crisp
and
clean
with
that
nice
spicy
hoppiness
must
be
some
saaz
hops
perfect
clarity
this
beer
is
a
winner
its
crisp
in
its
light
body
but
firm
and
the
carbonation
is
at
an
even
level
that
stays
strong
it
is
smooth
and
the
spiciness
translates
to
the
feel
without
doing
so
too
harshly
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
overall
certainly
tasty
especially
on
a
hot
afternoon
odd
release
date
for
this
style
of
beer
i
wouldnt
classify
it
solely
as
a
german
piilsner
with
some
characteristics
being
more
czechlike
worth
picking
up
if
youre
into
pilsners
3
75
paws
ive
been
making
a
conscious
effort
lately
to
try
more
pilsners
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
very
refreshing
clean
beer
i
could
have
easily
had
another
one
of
these
since
i
didnt
feel
the
booze
at
all
but
some
water
would
be
needed
as
a
chaser
in
between
sips
of
this
while
not
too
bready
or
full
of
yeast
there
was
just
enough
here
to
take
this
up
a
notch
while
keeping
this
relatively
light
if
it
was
warmer
out
id
grab
this
instead
of
an
american
macro
lager
on
a
hot
day
really
nice
addition
to
sierra
nevadas
lineup
and
a
great
choice
for
someone
whos
never
had
a
true
pilsener
before
hopped
up
american
style
pilsner
great
goto
pilsner
overall
a
very
good
pilsner
and
a
nice
addition
to
the
sierra
nevada
portfolio
could
be
a
nice
go
to
summer
brew
right
now
it
is
making
me
wish
it
was
summer
typical
german
pilsner
four
five
the
taste
has
a
nice
hop
flavor
with
subtlle
spice
and
herbal
quality
with
a
pilsner
flavor
maltwise
supporting
with
light
sweetness
and
gentle
mineral
yeast
in
the
flavor
with
mostly
dry
finish
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
pilsner
with
nice
amount
of
hop
flavor
and
decent
maltyeast
balance
very
drinkable
i
would
say
this
represents
the
style
well

o
quite
a
nice
take

the
style

a

hoppier

an
authentic
german
pilsner
ala

pils
not
as
sharp
as
the

with
the
grain
flexing
a
bit
more
strikes
a
nice
balance
its
not
bad
but
it
doesnt
nail
what
its
trying
to
be
which
i
assume
is
a
refreshingly
bitter
easydrinking
northern
germanstyle
pilsener
the
hops
are
too
floral
the
mouthfeel
is
too
sticky
and
the
beer
never
comes
together
as
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
just
goes
to
show
you
how
hard
it
is
to
get
this
style
right
despite
the
best
examples
of
it
being
so
criminally
underrated

i
enjoyed
sierra
nevadas
hoppy
lager
much
more
its
unapologetically
over
the
top
and
actually
better
balanced
than
this
one
true
to
the
description
here
this
beer
really
does
have
some
spice
from
the
hops
its
awesome
and
i
think
under
utilized
in
this
style
thats
the
beers
best
feature
by
far
but
its
not
all
that
different
to
me
than
foam
another
straightforward
pils
these
guys
did
last
year
maybe
a
little
more
flavor
and
a
little
less
body
in
this
one
but
i
preferred
nooner
as
a
session
ipa
from
the
four
way
ipa
box
there
are
enough
good
pilseners
out
there
without
this
one
although
it
is
quite
refreshing
even
though
the
cereal
grains
linger
a
bit
in
the
finish
not
as
crispy
as
i
often
like
my
lagers
to
be
but
i
absolutely
respect
the
beer
and
think
it
should
do
really
well
for
them
with
warmer
weather
around
the
corner
and
twelve
packs
of
cans
already
on
the
shelves
i
just
know
sierra
nevada
to
be
capable
of
greatness
so
every
time
they
put
out
a
b
level
beer
even
when
its
a
high
b
i
feel
a
little
let
down
thats
what
this
one
is
and
i
would
have
liked
to
see
nooner
the
session
ipa
stick
around
instead
but
thats
just
me
overall
hoppier
than
summerfest
but
not
as
hoppy
as
victory
prima
pils
nooner
is
an
excellent
take
on
a
german
pilsner

a
fairly

a

my
favorites

enjoyable
nonetheless
great
looking
pilsner
bright

golden
excellent

sweet

spicy

frothy
and

wow
i
bought
this
thinking
it
would
be
decent
but
it
really
is
a
pretty
outstanding
effort
by
sn
nice
easy
drinking
pilsner
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
definitely
getting
more
real
solid

this
one
could
be
a
great

beer
it
poured

with

with
a

well
you
know
what
i

i
dont
want
to
steal
anyone
elses
slogan
nice
job
sn
i
miss
a
good
pilsner
in
a
world
full
of
ipas
i
love
ipas
though
but
you
know
sometimes
i
need
a
good
pilsner
o
im
not
much
of
a
pilsener
guy
but
this
one
is
well
done
will
probably
taste
even
better
when
the
weather
warms
up
nice
light
golden
clear
with
a
steady
stream
of
carbonated
bubbles
flying
to
the
top
head
is
average
along
with
the
lacing
aroma
is
very
light
and
malty
taste
is
refreshing
with
elements
of
of
floral
hops
lemon
and
sweet
malt
coming
through
carbonation
is
ample
and
this
beer
is
balanced
extremely
well
with
a
very
crisp
clean
finish
cheers
yellow
color
decent
head
looks
typical
nose
is
slight
mineral
flavor
is
a
boring
pilsner
probably
easy
enough
to
session
but
not
interesting
enough
for
me
to
care
to
whooowee
this
is
one
beautiful
pilsner
delicate
yet
robust
with
enough
malt
for
a
great
mouthfeel
yet
very
quaffable
this
is
what
sierra
nevada
needed
to
round
out
a
superior
portfolio
sorry
sn
im
sure
this
is
a
good
pilsner
but
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
more
flavorful
and
just
as
refreshing
as
sierra
nevadas
longtime
summerfest
well
done
tasted
great
really
liked
will
buy
again
good
all
around
pilsner
nice
biting

crisp

with
a
semidry
finish
a
little
bitter
at
the
end
with
some
lingering
hops
but
still
leaves
a
light
footprint
notes
are
all
expected
for
the
style
with
some
bready
malt
dry
fruit
but
it
is
well
balanced
and
easy
my
overall
impression
is
that
this
is
a
very
well
balanced
example
of
the
style
very
easy
to
drink
with
a
pleasantly
light
after
taste
sierra
nevada
wins
again
with
flavorful
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
had
this
poured
out
of
the
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
enjoyed
during
the
super
bowl
pregame
nooner
line
is
of
course
great
for
marathon
drinking
but
will
likely
try
it
again
in
the
summer
pilsners
in
general
dont
have
a
ton
of
flavor
to
me
and
this
one
had
less
than
most
had
some
slight
spice
and
pine
flavor
but
not
much
little
scent
to
speak
of
color
was
a
clear
pale

so
slightly

o
a
nice
pilsner
that
is
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
picking
up

never
disappoints
too

for
a
pilsner
in
my
opinion
great

not
a

highly
drinkable
mouthfeel

well
carbonated
crisp
and
refreshing

very
dry
with
lingering
hop
bitterness
well
done
sierra
nevada
overall
an
excellent
shot
at
a
german
pils
by
a
us
brewer
and
one
that
will
doubtlessly
be
in
my
regular
rotation
throughout
the
year
one
of
the
best
domestic
german
pilseners
that
is
tostyle
and
doesnt
rely
on
gimmicky
hopping
to
get
drinks
overall
frankly
i
opted
to
try
a
sixpack
of
this
over
the
lagunitas
pils
sierra
nevadas
nooner
is
a
pleasing
pils
with
an
ease
of
drinkability
o
judging
this
within
its
category
nooner
is
at
the
top
of
its
class
this
wipes
out
scrimshaw
the
crisp
and
most
every
other
americanmade
pils
that
isnt
going
for
hoppy
pils
this
is
a
deadon
impression
of
a
germanstyle
pils
available
in
a
cheap
6
and
not
pasteurized
for
the
trip
over
the
ocean
thrilled
this
exists
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
i
thought
it
was
a
solid
example
of
the
style
it
had
pretty
much
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
a
nice
pilsener
but
i
still
think
theres
some
room
for
improvement
especially
in
the
mouthfeel
this
beer
had
ok
drinkability
it
was
smooth
a
little
crisp
fairly
creamy
slightly
filling
and
the
taste
did
an
ok
job
at
holding
my
attention
but
i
think
one
is
enough
for
me
the
flavor
doesnt
really
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
and
the
mouthfeel
holds
back
the
drinkability
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
the
appearance
it
was
one
damn
good
looking
pilsener
what
i
like
the
least
about
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
it
could
use
some
work
i
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
but
i
for
sure
wouldnt
turn
it
down
i
cant
say
i
would
recommend
it
as
a
great
pilsener
but
its
worth
a
try
if
you
like
the
german
pilseners
all
in
all
i
liked
this
beer
but
i
didnt
love
it
it
had
just
a
couple
aspects
that
held
it
back
from
being
as
good
as
it
could
be
but
in
the
end
it
was
still
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
i
didnt
mind
it
keep
up
the
solid
works
guys
i
think
a
little
bit
of
work
could
make
this
a
really
nice
beer
lots
of
spicy
herbal
hop
character
in
the
nose
and
on
the
tongue
there
is
a
little
something
sticky
lingering
long
after
the
swallow
dry
biscuity
malts
compliment
the
hops
nicely
hoppier
than
a
traditional
pils
i
guess
but
this
is
a
damn
satisfying
drink
too
many
local
options
as
good
or
a
bit
better
in
pa
so
this
wont
crack
my
regular
pils
rotation
pours
a
sparkling
pales
straw
color
with
a
one
and
one
half
finger
white
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
quickly
smell
is
grassy
and
bready
flavors
are
bready
grassy
earthy
biscuit
like
with
a
snap
of
hoppy
balance
mouthfeel
feel
is
light
and
effervescent
overall
a
good
pilsner
one
of
the
better
ive
had
while
it
definitely
has
a
german
pilsner
pulse
there
are
hints
of
czech
pilsner
in
its
makeup
poured
into
a
tulip
golden
yellow
color
dense
white
head
2
finger
faded
quickly
to
a
thin
cap
but
good
lacing
smells
of
grassy
hops
taste
was
sweet
and
bready
with
a
bitter
hoppy
finish
one
of
my
first
pilsners
id
buy
again
o
very
interesting
mix
of
the
german
and
american
pilsners
it
has
more
bread
malt
and
grassyhop
flavor
than
most
american
pilsners
which
tend
to
overemphasize
the
american
floral
hop
bitterness
e
g
prima
pils
the
crisp
its
a
great
brew
and
one
ill
revisit
from
time
to
time
a
definite
amount
of
restraint
on
making
this
too
american
or
too
bitter
which
is
a
huge
plus
crystal
clear
dry
crisp
and
refreshing
sierra
nevada
does
it
again
rjt
overall
it
started
out
quite
nicely
and
had
a
great
malt
and
lagering
crispness
nice
pilsner
overall
but
the
hops
just
get
way
too
bitter
and
spicy
on
the
back
end
and
especially
the
finish
unfortunately
they
drown
out
the
awesomeness
that
is
teh
great
pilsner
underneath
i
really
liked
this
one
and
i
hope
they
do
it
again
but
dial
back
a
bit
on
the
american
spicy
hops
and
keep
with
the
noble
ones
and
this
will
be
a
great
summer
beer
to
drink
at
noon
mediumlight
throughout
its
dry
absolute
finish
highlights
the
pilsner
grain
in
all
its
rustic
glory
lingering
hop
bite
hangs
in
the
gullet
and
seems
snappy
with
poppy
seed
and
lemongrass
even
with
the
afterglow
of
floral
and
perfume
pulsing
onward
this
is
a
nice
pils
good
example
of
a
german
style
one
kind
of
grassy
and
more
earthy
on
the
profile
easy
to
drink
and
consistent
with
a
nice
body
well
done
pretty
basic
pilsner
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
your
typical
light
beers
a
little
bit
of
a
strange
aftertaste
though
may
give
it
another
chance
one
day
but
it
was
nothing
to
boast
about
i
thought
this
was
awful
taste
like
natural
light
which
i
would
of
rather
of
had
overall
a
very
good
pilsner
not
too
hoppy
but
definitely
strong
enough
id
definitely
recommend
putting
this
beer
in
the
rotation
for
warmer
weather
o
i
bought
a
single
of
nooner
and
the
hoppy
lager
much
preferred
nooner
and
may
have
to
grab
a
six
pack
its
quite
good
i
love
it
it
almost
tastes
like
an
imperial
pilsner
without
the
sharp
bitterness
on
the
end
not
as
crisp
and
biting
as
a
lot
pilsners
which
is
nice
actually
a
roundedness
to
the
mouthfeel
foreseeable
easy
drinker
for
hot
summer
camping
sessions
overall
this
is
an
excellent
brew
fitting
of
a
sierra
nevada
product
absolutely
condor
recommended
and
approved
a
great
product
from
a
great
brewery
you
gotta
check
this
one
out
very
impressed
drinks
very
easy
i
could
see
picking
this
up
again
pours
a
nice
clear
gold
with
a
solid
carbonation
stream
and
a
light
creamy
white
head
the
head
hangs
on
a
little
and
leaves
some
nice
small
soapysticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
mild
with
light
biscuit
and
noble
hops
the
taste
though
is
much
more
robust
with
big
noble
bittering
hops
up
front
and
a
little
lighter
bready
and
light
fruit
flavors
backing
it
up
there
is
a
nice
fullness
to
the
body
with
just
a
little
carbonation
and
hops
bite
on
the
finish
they
can
this
too
so
this
seems
a
perfect
summer
or
camping
trip
beer
just
ok
by
me
typical
mass
produced
pilsner
flavor
was
expecting
much
more
overall
i
feel
they
tried
to
hop
up
or
spice
up
the
beer
more
than
a
traditional
pils
and
it
didnt
quite
work
for
me
sierra
nevada
rep
served
this
up
thank
you
at
tap
takeover
at
city
taphouse
in
philly
he
said
it
was
similar
recipe
to
foam
which
id
had
years
ago
at
bonnaroo
certainly
very
easy
drinking
thanks
so
much
tasty
but
basic
but
not
a
big
fan
of
this
one
serving
type
bottle
great
pilsner
tops
summerfest
summerfest
is
great
but
this
has
the
better
malt
balance
will
be
buying
by
the
case
cheers
to
a
superbly
balanced
lager
overall
to
me
this
is
right
up
there
with
sunshine
pils
extremely
drinkable
sessionable
great
flavor
and
body
has
all
the
signature
sierra
nevada
traits
which
i
enjoy
bottle
into
pint
glass
the
nooner
pours
a
clear
medium
straw
to
light
golden
in
color
and
sports
a
white
cap
of
foam
aroma
of
classic
pils
malt
and
a
faint
hop
character
and
not
as
robust
as
i
might
have
guessed
standard
taste
as
well
and
with
a
light
bready
finish
with
a
touch
of
spice
bit
more
of
a
creamy
carbonation
that
your
typical
pils
that
carbonation
gives
it
a
fuller
feel
though
perhaps
at
the
expense
of
more
nuanced
malt
flavors
that
may
or
may
not
be
lurking
beneath
very
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
just
a
nice
semihoppy
lager
clear
gold
color
with
a
pillowy
white
head
smells
a
bit
spicy
and
a
little
bready
tastes
breadybiscuity
light
floral
and
spiced
hops
in
there
very
crisp
and
light
carbonation
complements
the
flavor
in
this
beer
nicely
not
a
bad
pilsner
aftertaste
was
harsher
than
expected
theres
definitely
a
pils
flavor
to
it
but
the
signature
sierra
nevada
hops
just
mess
the
beer
up
not
a
bad
beer
but
a
weird
mix
to
my
mouth
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
excellent
taste
nice
golden
color
on
the
pour
good
aroma
wheat
based
feel
was
smooth
with
a
bitter
bite
at
the
end
very
good
beer
an
instant
favorite
for
me
and
just
beautifully
simple
up
there
with
pivo
pils
and
live
oak
pils
as
one
of
my
favorite
us
made
lagers
i
will
be
interested
to
try
this
next
to
summerfest
but
from
memory
this
is
far
superior
so
happy
this
is
year
round
i
see
many
more
cases
in
my
future
a
very
easy
drinkable
beer
its
like
a
pbr
but
with
much
more
flavor
seriously
when
will
pilsners
come
back
in
style
for
craft
beers
i
love
a
good
ipa
and
all
but
a
well
done
pilsner
is
just
something
wonderful
overall
just
a
real
nice
solid
bready
pilsner
but
not
mindblowing
o
more
malt
and
a
slightly
higher
abv
than
one
might
expect
for
a
nooner
session
beer
still
very
drinkable
and
no
bothersome
flaws
of
all
the
american
breweries
that
i
have
tried
this
comes
the
closest
to
what
a
true
german
pilsener
tastes
like
wrote
a
review
because
it
was
required
o
can
be
considered
amongst
the
greats
of
the
style
for
my
money
thank
you
sierra
nevada
for
making
a
year
round
pils
that
is
this
good
will
be
a
goto
spring
and
summer
beer
for
me
nice
dry
slightly
hoppy
clean
taste
very
easy
drinking
very
nice
pilsner
bought
this
as
a
single
but
i
believe
a
6er
of
nooner
is
in
my
future
overall
the
longawaited
year
round
sierra
nevada
pilsner
i
like
it
and
will
certainly
make
it
a
mainstay
in
my
refrigerator
tastes
like
it
was
brewed
with
an
adjunct
cutting
the
malt
does
not
taste
at
all
like
any
german
pilsener
ive
had
a
bit
corny
without
much
malt
or
hop
flavor
i
love
pilsners
but
this
tastes
more
like
a
light
american
lageraal

this

is
better
than
miller

of
course
but
it
doesnt
offer
much
more
than
a
cleaner
and
crisper
version
of
that
classic
american
pilsner
i
bet
it
will
make
them
some
money
though

in

of

aftertaste
i
cant
lie
the
name
made
me
expect
a
light
crisp
beer
with
some
hops
because
of
the
brand
the
honest
to
goodness
result
is
a
beer
that
isnt
great
and
the
abv
and
title
dont
make
any
sense
if
you
see
this
on
draft
by
all
means
give
it
a
go
but
id
pass
on
another
6er
overall
well
what
else
can
i
say
sn
does
it
again
this
is
a
damn
good
pilsner
full
flavored
very
good
hop
presence
yet
feels
nice
and
refreshingly
light
im
definitely
a
fan
of
this
beer
the
only
question
is
which
i
like
better
summerfest
or
nooner
sadly
i
wont
be
able
to
do
a
sidebyside
comparison
for
a
few
months
yet
this
is
a
solid
pilsener
its
not
one
of
my
favorites
but
its
definitely
a
respectable
example
of
the
style
overall
i
cut
my
teeth
on
good
german
pilsners
this
one
ranks
pretty
close
its
fullflavored
with
a
nice
hop
bitterness
just
right

offering
o
i
so
wanted
to
like
this
beer
to
have
available
for
a
common
goto
but
the
hop
character
is
just
not
traditional
pils
all
of
the
hops
used
are
traditional
except
for
the
saphir
theres
something
about
this
hop
when
used
as
a
replacement
for
traditional
noble
hops
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
my
palate
or
my
expectation
of
traditional
lager
styles
personally
ill
stick
with
trumer
as
a
goto
pils
and
enjoy
sns
summerfest
for
a
seasonal
the
flavor
is
a
great
example
of
the
pilsner
style
lots
of
crackery
malts
light
bitterness
grain
and
an
almost
wheat
like
taste
super
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
floral
l
lemony

tastefully
jammed

crushable
a
nice

pilsner
from
the
venerable
sierra

grains
full
of
cracker

flavors
fill
the
palate
punctuated
on
both
ends
by
a
nice
snap

nice
and
dry
goes
down
very

definitely
a

will

a
good
every
day
beer
as
in
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
long
o
very
good
hits
all
the
marks
for
the
style
its
always
nice
to
have
a
quality
pilsner
around
o
probably
my
new
go
to
yr
round
very
balanced
true
to
style
and
not
too
hoppy
like
some
of
the
other
brewers
it
does
get
your
attention
so
it
reminds
you
it
is
sn
overall
a
very
solid
take
on
a
classic
style
euro
pilsner
good
crisp
bready
malt
notes
with
some
nice
floral
hop
and
fruit
notes
classic
pils
taste
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
example
of
a
classic
german
style
from
an
american
brewer
the
original
session
beer
indeed
i
wish
more
people
in
the
states
could
build
an
appreciation
for
it
this
beer
is
very
dry
but
the
aftertaste
is
very
bready
and
grainy
a
lot
of
pilsners
are
like
this
i
just
prefer
the
ones
that
arent
i
would
rather
have
lingering
hop
flavor
than
malt
flavor
nevertheless
this
is
a
very
good
americanbrewed
german
pilsner
far
better
than
the
summerfest
offering
3

overalla
very
nice
take
on
the
style
very
refreshing
would
definitely
buy
more
when
it
gets
a
bit
warmer
outside
good
example
of
a
german
style
pilsner
lemony
and
spicy
hops
light
maltiness
and
crisp
clean
finish
typical
pilsner
pour
with
pale
golden
body
small
head
and
lively
carbonation
the
smell
was
more
hoppy
than
the
typical
pilsner
as
there
was
a
more
floral
quality
to
this
than
the
typical
restrained
grassy
smell
from
saaz
hops
the
taste
was
a
mix
of
grainy
sweetness
and
hops
with
some
cooked
corn
in
the
taste
but
no
more
than
typical
for
the
style
the
hops
were
spicy
and
also
added
a
hint
of
lemon
peel
the
body
was
light
and
quenching
but
did
not
feel
watery
this
was
a
well
crafted
pilsner
as
can
be
expected
from
this
tp
notch
brewery
overall
very
well
done
to
the
style
a
well
crafted
beer
a
well
done
german
pilsner
tasty
and
easy
drinking
overall
i
might
prefer
a
couple
less
ibus
and
a
touch
less
carbonation
in
short
i
prefer
summerfest
but
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
nonetheless
o
a
welcome
addition
to
their
yearly
offerings
could
become
a
regular
in
my
beer
fridge

really
good
pils
an
unermade
style
by
todays
micros
in
recent
months
hans
pils
from
real
ale
has
been
my
goto
session
beer
i
think
this
might
well
displace
it
really
good
deadon
style
nice
and
flavorful
expecting
that
summerfest
flavor
but
this
is
all
together
different
definitely
more
complex
than
summerfest
has
a
nice
thick
hop
scent
up
front
head
discolors
after
the
first
pour
and
lacing
is
minimal
the
flavor
makes
up
for
the
inadequacy
of
the
latter
nice
and
smooth
with
a
ever
so
slight
bitterness
that
is
enjoyable
through
sequence
going
down
fast
aftertaste
is
wonderful
smell
translates
to
the
flavor
and
doesnt
have
that
overly
sweet
taste
i
think
i
will
enjoy
a
least
three
more
of
these
before
im
through
before
you
know
it
your
on
your
second
pick
the
traditional
pilsner
glass
to
get
the
full
experience
of
this
beer
hats
off
to
sierra
nevada
again
nice
beer
excellent
pilsner
that
beats
all
others
ive
tried
amazing
flavor
that
has
lightness
and
drinkability
skin
to
the
summerfest
pilsner
but
with
a
deeper
more
complex
flavor
with
the
hops
character
one
would
expect
from
sierra
nevada
very
very
very
very
light
bottle
clear
as
day
bright
golden
color
big
frothy
dense
head
lots
of
individual
scars
of
laces
that
mark
my
progress
down
the
glass
looks
exactly
how
it
should
smells
of
lager
yeast
pils
malt
spicy
and
sudsy
hops
some
slightly
sweet
cereal
grains
the
flavor
has
some
pop
a
pilsner
through
and
through
hops
arent
overly
intense
yet
the
lend
flavors
of
grass
soap
spice
and
flower
dry
lager
yeast
and
pils
malt
finishes
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
pale
grainy
flavor
sierra
nevada
is
really
stressing
this
beer
being
a
session
beer
i
agree
that
it
is
but
also
boasts
a
surprisingly
full
body
perfect
carbonation
a
very
well
done
pilsner
this
sixer
will
be
recycled
quite
quickly
taste
clean
and
malty
with
a
tinge
of
hoppiness
coming
in
at
the
finish
a
very
pleasant
easydrinking
and
welldone
pilsner
and
a
perfectly
refreshing
beer
for
a
warm
day
will
drink
more
of
these
yes
refreshing
crisp
citrusy
and
quite
tasty
great
pilsner
easy
to
drink
but
unique
enough
to
force
you
to
take
it
slow
looks
great
in
the
glass
smells
sweet
and
not
quite
picking
up
the
fresh
noble
variety
of
hops
like
i
do
in
some
well
made
pilsners
taste
is
pleasant
and
enjoyable
although
like
the
nose
the
euro
hop
flavors
seems
to
be
missing
has
a
heavy
grain
taste
good
and
has
an
overly
dry
finish
not
so
go
overall
i
enjoyed
this
pilsner
would
definitely
drink
again
but
there
are
several
others
that
i
would
go
to
take
over
this
one
if
options
are
available
o
ive
tasted
a
number
of
germanstyle
pilsners
over
the
years
and
this
one
is
spoton
nice
effort
by
sierra
nevada
overall
incredibly
refreshing
this
a
great
representation
of
a
pilsner
without
having
too
much
hop
bitterness
wellbalanced
and
well
done
im
looking
forward
to
finding
cans
fantastic
pilsner
fantastic
brewery
very
hop
forward
o
very
enjoyable
and
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
example
of
the
style
and
im
digging
the
can
packaging
since
it
will
make
this
a
good
choice
for
outdoor
activities
tailgating
refreshing
hits
all
the
right
notes
of
the
style
to
me
o
a
very
nice
american
version
of
a
german
pilsner
with
great
drinkability
and
simplicity
thats
a
good
thing
highly
recommended
but
thats
almost
expected
coming
from
sn
i
wouldnt
call
this
the
most
authentic
german
pilsner
but
it
stands
by
itself
and
isnt
afraid
to
cross
the
boundaries
to
create
a
marvelous
tasting
yet
refreshing
beer
i
will
be
buying
again

taste
is

that
soft

graceful
malt
rolls
over
the

light
touch
of
fine

sweetness
the

leafy
and
herbal
peppery

lean
onto

whimsically
with
a
very
slight

take
you

pils
malt
is
a

this

was
vunderbar
some
people
love

but
i
have
yet
to
drink
a
quality
beer
from
them
this
toasts
like
a
water

with
a
bit
of
a
halloween
type

nothing

but
will
say
this
can
stand
on
its
own
light
crisp
refreshing
and
very
tasty
this
is
a
must
try
pilsener
this
beer
was
pretty
good
the
palate
opens
crisp
and
clean
with
a
blend
of
pleasant
lemony
saaz
bitterness
earthy
hops
and
a
mild
doughy
sweetness
despite
the
pronounced
hop
character
it
is
lacking
in
that
snap
that
the
best
german
pilsners
have
a
very
faint
butterscotch
character
is
present
on
the
mid
palate
drying
on
the
finish
with
a
blend
of
lemony
bitterness
earthy
woodsy
hop
flavor
and
a
sweet
dough
flavor
this
beer
is
crisply
carbonated
and
quite
excellent
on
the
palate
excellent
stuff
was
looking
for
a
refreshing
beer
this
did
it
without
losing
flavor
too
the
light
citrus
flavor
compounded
with
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
are
overall
reminiscent
of
grapefruit
very
simple
very
refreshing
overall
a
nice
pilsner
from
a
great
brewery
this
would
make
for
a
nice
summer
beer
good
pils
good
pilsner
o
3
75
good
beer
though
the
noble
hop
taste
is
what
i
look
for
most
in
german
pils
this
is
good
but
its
not
going
to
become
one
of
my
goto
pilses
pretty
solid
pilsner
could
be
a
tad
hoppier
for
my
liking
but
its
certainly
within
style
definitely
got
some
real
malt
flavor
vs
the
cheap
macro
lagers
its
nothing
mind
blowing
but
its
what
youd
expect
from
smutty
o
nice
easy
drinking
american
brewed
german
pilsener
o
this
pilsner
was
promising
to
start
but
went
completely
downhill
really
fast
as
far
as
german
pilsners
go
this
one
is
seriously
lacking
in
depth
and
complexity
smuttynose
can
do
far
better
and
so
can
fans
of
this
style
overall
maybe
a
bad
bottle
or
maybe
just
bad
beer
its
taken
me
long
enough
but
ive
finally
gotten
around
to
trying
out
this
semiheralded
pils
it
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
strong
grass
greens
mild
biscuit
and
a
touch
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
wintergreen
way
in
the
distance
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
noblestyle
hops
really
taking
the
fore
without
overdoing
things
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
straightforwardly
crisp
finish
overall
a
nice
pils
nothing
special
but
something
i
could
easily
drink
again
ill
revisit
this
one
again
if
i
can
find
a
fresh
one
nice
pilsner
none
the
less
this
is
a
delightfully
flavorful
representation
of
a
pilsner
that
pours
slightly
cloudy
the
nose
permeates
the
senses
with
noble
hops
and
a
slight
bit
of
maltiness
the
herbaceous
minty
hops
sweep
though
the
palate
coating
the
inside
of
my
mouth
while
an
almost
unlikely
sweetness
subdues
the
initial
impact
of
the
hops
this
sweetness
dissipates
and
gives
way
to
a
pleasantly
dry
finish
pale
straw
clear
with
visible
rising
carbonation
bubbles
head
large
at
first
fades
rather
quickly
aroma
is
zesty
bright
and
crisp
clean
cracker
malt
with
lemon
taste
matches
with
lemon
pepper
and
fresh
grainy
malt
a
well
done
pils
that
im
sure
ill
return
to
again
and
again
12oz
bottle
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
may
not
be
made
with
bohemian
water
but
this
is
a
darn
good
pilsner
this
pours
a
nice
straw
golden
with
appropriate
carbonation
smell
is
slightly
breadlike
taste
is
crisp
clean
appropriately
bitter
and
with
just
the
appropriate
hint
of
earthy
flavor
i
really
like
this
hopefully
to
the
approval
of
my
many
german
and
germanamerican
ancestors
a
good
pils
overall
if
somewhat
plainjane
i
had
my
first
glass
at
the
same
brewpub
several
days
earlier
and
if
i
recall
i
was
more
overly
impressed
with
the
flavor
than
this
glassful
but
this
is
the
sample
i
took
notes
on
its
still
an
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
lager
o
easy
to
drink
light
and
refreshing
a
good
pilsner
worthy
of
a
try

to
taste
off
full
sail
other
pilsners
and
it
won
in
my
book

this
is
a
great

refresher

not
much
to

nice

bready
yeasty
and
somewhat
sweet

full
and

german
in
execution
its
going
quite
nicely
with
my
sausages
that
im
having
for
lunch
another
good
one
from
smuttynose
prost
the
taste
and
feel
are
deeply
intertwined
as
a
crisp
clean
refreshing
taste
ends
in
a
similar
feel
cereal
maltiness
compliment
a
bready
grain
and
end
in
more
hops
than
in
typical
pilsners
very
easy
on
the
throat
the
carbonation
is
easily
visible
but
barely
noticeable
this
is
a
light
airy
version
of
a
pilsner
and
a
very
good
one

its

find
boring

with
i
personally
love
a
good
pilsener
and
i
can
appreciate
this
one
but
it
didnt
truly
grab
my
attention
its
just
okay
o
excellent
pilsener
just
right
for
what
will
probably
be
the
hottest
day
of
the

is
quite
refreshing
but
all
in
all
is
quite
boring
o
a
solid
pilsner
hops
could
be
more
pronounced
but
otherwise
theres
little
to
complain
about
other
than
the
lack
of
uniqueness
which
isnt
a
big
deal
either
full
disclosure
the
best
buy
date
on
the
bottle
i
had
was
about
6
weeks
past
so
given
the
general
fragility
of
pilsners
i
suppose
that
could
be
the
problem
still
a
well
made
pilsener
produced
right
here
in
new
england
balanced
refreshing
and
contains
all
of
the
elements
you
would
expect
in
this
style
i
remember
liking
it
at
the
brewery
well
done
yellow
in
color
but
fairly
hazy
for
a
pilsner
small
head
that
clings
to
the
edges
of
the
glass
but
leaves
no
lacing
behind
floral
hop
aroma
with
strong
biscuit
malt
overtones
good
carbonation
but
still
a
little
soft
for
the
style
and
a
very
dry
finish
i
am
a
pilsner
fan
but
something
about
this
one
just
misses
the
mark
perhaps
its
not
as
crisp
as
i
like
them
to
be
its
a
quite
addictive
beer
the
dry
finish
and
good
hops
makes
this
a
really
good
beer
unfortunately
i
had
a
bottle
that
was
too
old
however
it
still
stood
out
as
one
of
the
best
america
made
pilsners
i
have
had
i
would
love
to
get
this
fresh
with
more
hops
o
a
crisp
hop
focused
bitter
beer
that
is
slightly
unbalanced
but
to
be
fair
the
brew
suggested
an
enjoy
by
date
about
six
weeks
back
its
still
a
pretty
decent
beer
but
i
can
imagine
this
is
a
very
good
beer
when
its
fresh
and
ill
keep
an
eye
out
for
next
years
release
i
greatly
appreciate
a
brewer
that
will
put
an
bottle
on
or
enjoy
by
date
when
youre
getting
a
hoppy
beer
you
want
to
know
that
sort
of
thing
overall
i
am
not
sure
how
old
this
is
but
it
tastes
great
nice
short
batch
series
i
wish
i
could
find
more
oa
decent
pilsner
still
not
a
style
i
enjoy
but
this
is
a
better
one
im
not
a
pilsner
guy
putting
it
mildly
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
has
a
somewhat
unique
flavor
that
finishes
with
and
bear
with
me
a
walnutlike
taste
smell
and
mouthfeel
pretty
uninspiring
but
other
than
that
i
dig
it
probably
be
a
good
session
beer
oa
decent
pilsener
but
not
outstanding
i
only
bought
one
of
these
but
i
could
have
easily
downed
all
of
a
4pack
in
a
session
had
i
bought
them
its
not
often
that
a
beer
catches
me
by
surprise
or
that
something
this
light
in
hue
and
taste
can
match
up
with
darker
beers
that
are
higherrated
on
here
but
this
could
certainly
fit
that
bill
no
doubt
that
this
is
a
winner
from
smuttynose
and
about
a
good
a
session
beer
thats
on
the
shelf
right
now
to
the
point
that
i
wish
i
had
another

citrus
is
a

theres
a

of

with

a
nice
representation

the
style
and
definitely
a
beer
that
i
would
purchase
on
a
regular
basis
if
it
was
added
as
a
summer
seasonal
that
said
if
the
flavor
was
a
little
cleaner
and
crisper
this
beer
would
really
excel
for
the
style
another
great
beer
from
smutty
o
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
lighter
beer
to
session
with
for
a
long
time
overall
a
quite
refreshing
and
quaffable
pilsner
maybe
not
100
stylistically
accurate
but
quite
tasty
nonetheless
o
overall
a
bit
dry
lacks
that
distinct
grainy
and
czech
hop
character
some
bitterness
but
the
proof
is
in
the
malting
and
this
misses
out
per
style
a
bitter
and
zesty
lemon
punch
up
front
backed
by
a
smooth
biscuity
middle
ends
on
a
bitter
herb
note
with
a
clean
dry
finish
this
is
an
excellent
pilsner
more
sweet
than
crisp
but
still
a
nice
mouthfeel
i
would
drink
more
of
these
d
very
drinkable
and
wonderfully
crafted

glen
nh
odpretty
good
but
i
am
struggling
to
see
why
this
is
in
a
four
pack
its
a
pretty
standard
pils
just
pack
it
up
like
a
normal
sixer
anyway
its
pretty
enjoyable
but
i
struggle
to
find
anything
truly
memorable
about
this
beer
its
very
solid
but
also
unspectacular
taste
starts
out
with
a
grainy
front
with
a
grassy
bitter
finish
carbonation
is
very
sharp
and
refreshing
almost
thirst
quenching
and
a
clean
finish
o
good
stuff
an
easy
drinking
yet
flavorful
pilsner
i
could
quaff
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
and
be
happy
o
a
nice
pils
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
as
well
as
being
flavorful
it
would
be
very
easy
to
drink
the
4pack
in
a
sitting
if
youre
not
so
into
lagers
and
are
questioning
whether
or
not
this
is
worth
picking
up
i
say
give
it
a
shot
there
arent
too
many
lager
characteristics
that
really
make
themselves
known
including
the
yeast
which
is
nice
overall
a
tasty
and
quaffable
pils
overall
a
real
great
mix
of
lingering
bitterness
and
sweetness
on
the
swallow
too
with
a
sweet
bread
finish
great
tasting
beer
o
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
easily
sessionable
and
quite
enjoyable
overall
it
started
nice
but
went
down
hill
quickly
too
watery
lacking
carbonation
and
more
of
the
toasty
pilsner
malts
and
hops
dont
suit
it
well
the
bottle
is
a
far
cry
from
the
draft
version
i
had
a
couple
years
ago
either
the
bottling
didnt
help
the
beer
at
all
or
the
recipe
changed
or
possibly
they
got
too
big
too
fast
and
couldnt
handle
the
more
subtle
beers
ill
have
to
try
a
few
more
from
them
to
see
how
their
other
beers
are
doing
o
this
beer
makes
for
a
good
aperitif
or
a
drink
to
pair
with
a
meal
its
rather
drinkable
o
tasty
and
an
easy
quaff
cant
ask
for
much
more
on
a
hot
summer
day
the
sharp
hop
bitterness
adds
some
acidity
that
when
taken
in
tandem
with
the
crisp
carbonation
make
this
beer
even
more
thirstquenching
and
drinkable
o
a
fine
example
of
the
style

and
easy

lemon
biscuit
and
grains
of
paradise
taste
is
very
much
that
balanced
wonderfully
nothing
really
dominant
body
is
medium
thin
great
amount
of
life
not
too
dry
and
easy
drinking
this
is
a
excellent
pilsner
could
hammer
the
4
pack
really
fast
on
a
hot
day
great
looking
beer
when
poured
light
straw
color
with
just
a
touch
of
haze
good
head
thats
in
it
for
the
long
haul
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
mix
of
light
malt
spicy
hops
and
that
lager
yeast
that
is
so
refreshing
in
the
heat
the
hops
are
up
front
in
flavor
but
not
strong
just
present
this
fades
into
the
light
malt
and
lager
yeast
notes
crisp
and
refreshing
overall
not
a
replacement
for
the
german
imports
but
a
decent
enough
beer
from
the
bottle
stamped
with
an
expiration
date
of
111412
sampled
on
june
14
2012
the
pour
is
pale
yellow
and
slightly
murky
with
an
excitable
carbonation
that
turns
to
a
ring
and
sticks
around
when
i
check
out
the
aroma
i
really
get
that
traditional
german
bready
malt
characteristic
with
a
vague
hop
note
on
the
backside
the
body
is
mostly
light
with
a
keen
creamy
sensation
the
taste
is
also
rather
malty
but
with
a
vague
citrus
twist
and
a
soft
but
bitter
hop
finale
it
works
well
on
a
hot
day
mildly
fruity
particularly
in
the
swallow
light
hop
throughout
decent
body
and
carbonation
good
example
of
a
german
pils
nice
light
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
one
is
real
good
ill
be
sure
to
grab
some
four
packs
of
this
often
pours
a
light
and
slightly
cloudy
straw
color
with
a
smallish
bone
white
head
that
shows
some
great
determination
smells
of
sweet
malts
and
lots
of
spicy
earthy
hops
hints
of
honey
and
sweet
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
lemony
tartness
taste
follows
the
smell
fairly
well
lots
of
earthy
floral
hops
piled
on
top
of
a
mild
sweet
malty
base
medium
body
and
level
of
carbonation
with
a
sweet
almost
tart
mouthfeel
nice
pilsener
i
really
enjoyed
this
light
refreshing
and
a
bit
hoppy
poured
as
part
of
a
barrel
tasting
event
the
beer
is
in
a
tulip
bright
hazy
honey
gold
color
with
a
tall
frothy
light
white
head
clean
aromas
with
hints
of
butter
and
biscuit
and
a
light
floral
essence
also
flavors
are
bold
on
an
extremely
light
almost
sharp
body
toasted
grains
butter
rich
and
a
kiss
of
orange
zest
very
tasty
and
bold
the
aftertaste
showcases
the
subtle
dry
and
tangy
hops
quick
and
amazingly
clean
finish
very
good
color
is
deeply
golden
the
head
was
about
one
finger
but
stayed
longer
than
expected
crisp
refreshing
nose
with
a
bit
of
floral
hop
aroma
and
some
warmth
from
hoppy
spice
notes
very
refreshing
taste
on
this
one
cool
and
not
very
aggressive
it
is
definitely
sessionable
rather
thin
feel
needs
more
carbonation
but
could
be
from
the
growler
being
a
day
old
good
beer
for
lounging
out
in
the
sun
i
doubt
ill
give
up
on
german
or
local
pils
for
this
beer
any
time
soon
but
this
is
a
decent
easy
to
appreciate
beer
from
smuttynose
the
highlight
of
this
beer
is
the
mouthfeel
its
plush
silky
and
luxurious
im
guessing
this
was
decocted
with
love
sampled
ontap
at
the
cloverleaf
tavern
i
wasnt
too
impressed
with
this
german
depiction
spritzy
light
with
a
dash
of
lemon
and
honey
zest
but
overall
nothing
to
brag
about
a
good
warmweather
summertime
beer
to
say
the
least
otherwise
not
one
of
smuttyoses
best
depictions
pours
a
light
golden
yellow
almost
see
through
bright
white
onefinger
head
aroma
of
grass
light
toasted
grain
very
light
crisp
compact
flavor
light
sweet
grass
flavor
toasty
grains
yeast
and
sweet
pale
malt
hint
of
spice
but
like
the
general
flavor
nothing
overpowering
or
dominating
very
cohesive
drinkable
crisp
and
dry
its
lightbodied
and
eminently
drinkable
lager
as
for
drinkability
its
amazing
smooth
crisp
easy
to
drink
i
wish
smutty
would
release
vunderbahr
as
a
regular
release
as
this
it
would
be
a
great
gateway
craft
beer
for
nonbeer
geeks
i
love
lagers
i
wish
my
local
breweries
did
more
the
subtle
sweet
bready
malts
along
with
the
delicate
grassy
hops
are
delightful
i
think
the
clean
and
crisp
aspect
of
the
brew
make
this
an
awesome
drinking
brew
the
slightly
drying
hop
finish
completes
it
this
brew
would
be
way
to
easy
to
drink
mass
quantities
of
i
hope
to
see
more
of
this
next
year

poured
a
light
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
fluffy
pure
white
head
maintained
phenomanol
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
fruit
bananas
mostly
and
grain
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
bananas
and
spices
it
had
a
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
lowmid
carbonation
overall
this
one
wasnt
that
bad
nor
was
it
that
great
this
one
did
have
some
nice
flavors
going
on
but
they
were
just
too
bundled
together
and
didnt
stand
out
on
their
own
this
one
is
worth
trying
at
least
once
but
that
would
be
about
it
for
me
at
least
overall
an
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
really
is
perfect
for
a
warm
summner
day
easily
accessible
yet
complex
definitely
worth
seeking
out

a
grassy

bitter
undertone
maybe
nothing
special
but
definitely
enjoyable
smooth
texture
lacks
firmness
and
fizz
leaves
something
to
be
desired
still
a
decent
pilsner
o
keller
pils
is
a
pleasant
surprise
especially
since
unless
i
misread
the
stamp
this
beer
appears
to
be
pretty
damned
old
but
my
fault
for
not
seeing
that
in
store
this
is
good
enough
imo
to
buy
regularly
but
at
106
i
likely
will
only
revist
it
if
on
special
it
is
very
good
though
crushable
this
sixer
doesnt
stand
a
chance

o
i
could
genuinely
session
this
this
has
enough
flavor
to
make
me
want
to
take
my
time
with
it
but
is
still
immensely
drinkable
would
be
great
in
the
summertime
natch
overall
this
is
a
very
drinkable
but
rather
intensely
flavored
light
beer
the
small
bottle
makes
a
great
taster
i
think
a
big
quaff
would
wear
out
its
welcome
from
the
12
oz

purchased
at
bottleworks
in

probably
pretty

theres
a

to
the

that
only
kellerbiers
have
with
the

this
beer
has
a

with

excellent
o
not
a
lot
to
say
other
than
i
like
it
and
would
welcome
several
more
into
my

though
that
would
probably
be
a
few
too
many
i
think
they
did
a

throws
off
the

a

only

happy
seeing

pack
in

good
stuff
a

made

a
pleasant
surprise
overall
nothing
incredibly
impressive
but
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
that
is
highly
drinkable
to
call
it
a
keller
implies
its
both
unfiltered
and
maybe
still
contains
live
yeast
unfortunately
there
was
no
evidence
of
cloudiness
or
live
yeast
wither
in
aromaflavor
or
in
the
pint
glass
nonetheless
i
really
shouldnt
hold
them
up
to
german
standards
when
it
comes
to
nomenclature
should
i
still
wow
o
a
really
nice
fresh
tasting
pilsner
with
lots
of
character
lacking
a
little
in
the
mouthfeel
and
not
as
refreshing
as
it
should
be
keller
pils
this
thing
looks
pretty
damn
filtered
to
me
regardless
my
complaining
stops
there
clear
deep

a

that
sticks
here
and
there

a
really
nice
pils
here
definitely
worth
a
buy
but
for
a
better
price
i
think
ill
go
for
sierra
nevada
summerfest
more
often
i
do
love
the
idea
of
doing
a
single
hop
variety
and
rotating
it
each
year
i
just
wish
they
would
let
us
know
what
that
variety
is
for
palate
education
purposes
mouthfeel
is
very
good
i
like
a
bitter
pils
and
this
ones
pretty
bitter
with
a
light
body
but
full
enough
to
stand
up
to
the
hops
and
clean
refreshing
feel
i
would
recommend
it
highly
for
those
looking
for
a
good
bitter
pilsner
overall
a
really
good
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
and
refreshing

it
does
have

clear
bright
yellow
with
a
thin
head
and
minimal
lacing
its
aroma
is
mainly
lemons
with
cake
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
flabor
leads
off
with
lemons
followed
on
the
palate
by
birthday
cake
and
a
bubbly
champagnelike
snap
the
finish
reveals
a
note
of
hop
bitterness
but
is
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
refreshing
southhampton
keller
pils
is
a
good
brew
recommended
very
good
would
i
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
this
probably
not
but
in
a
pinch
you
would
not
go
wrong
bringing
this
to
a
q
o
a
very
nice
american
take
on
a
classic
pils
style
plenty
of
flavor
and
lingering
bitterness
i
dig
it
o
i
look
forward
to
having
a
couple
of
these
every
year
this
is
just
an
excellent
pils
the
hop
varieties
change
every
year
but
it
seems
very
subtle
flavor
follows
the
nose
although
the
bready
malt
is
the
dominant
taste
grassy
hops
are
next
in
line
and
theres
just
a
trace
of
lemony
citrus
in
the
finish
lightly
grainy
and
bitter
at
the
same
time
body
is
mediumlight
with
crisp
carbonation
clean
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
unremarkable
good
flavor
and
very
drinkable
but
not
much
of
a
crisp
or
clean
finish
i
like
in
a
pilsner
i
can
appreciate
the
craft
that
has
gone
into
producing
this
beer
but
overall
it
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
southampton
never
fails
to
hit
the
mark
and
their
keller
pils
is
no
exception
the
malt
is
grainy
and
sweet
and
the
hops
are
floral
and
spicy
both
in
the
aroma
and
the
flavor
the
small
amount
of
yeast
adds
a
subtle
touch
of
character
as
well
its
solidly
bitter
but
not
overdone
leaving
it
perfectly
balanced
the
malt
appears
up
front
followed
immediately
by
the
hop
flavors
and
then
a
rising
bitterness
as
you
enter
the
long
dry
finish
its
not
a
complex
beer
nor
is
it
intended
to
be
but
it
is
full
of
flavor
if
theres
any
flaw
here
its
that
the
head
retention
could
be
better
quite
nice
well
worth
trying
golden
hay
color
with
loads
of
carbonation
and
a
fizzy
white
head
that
capped
out
at
three
inches
and
then
settled
down
to
nothing
not
thrilled
with
that
aroma
is
very
light
and
clean
bready
and
cereal
grains
light
touches
of
grassy
and
floral
notes
and
a
touch
of
light
hay
very
light
and
clean
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
mild
some
grains
taste
is
crisp
slightly
sweet
a
bit
of
malts
and
grains
just
a
touch
of
hops
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
a
nicely
done
keller
pils
maybe
a
touch
heavy
on
the
wheatbiscuit
type
malts
but
still
very
tasty
from
a
bottle
pours
a
light
mostly
clear
gold
with
a
small
fluffy
white
head
nose
is
fresh
cracked
grain
pilsner
hops
some
grass
mouth
is
a
vibrant
expression
of
fresh
grain
a
pleasant
hop
quality
that
kind
of
swells
in
the
mid
palate
a
touch
of
grass
and
maybe
some
light
citrus
rind
a
little
bit
of
an
eggy
quality
that
creeps
in
as
with
some
of
the
hoppier
german
pilsners
not
super
snappy
but
pretty
nice
definitely
more
in
the
german
style
than
in
the
czech
style
hats
of
to
these
guys
for
producing
a
quality
lager
unlike
a
majority
of
craft
brewers
o
first
beer
from
them
overall
it
should
be
very
enjoyable
to
lovers
of
pilsner
i
found
it
had
a
nice
citrus
edge
that
paired
nicely
with
some
grilled
scallops
and
shrimp
pours
a
hazed
yellow
gold
color
with
average
cap
of
white
froth
decent
retention
scent
is
quite
pleasant
pilsner
malt
forward
with
equal
parts
doughy
bread
cut
grass
lemongrass
and
a
faint
splash
of
earthy
spice
taste
follows
scent
good
lightly
sweet
pilsner
malt
with
some
graininess
to
it
doughy
bread
and
the
hops
bring
cut
grass
lemon
zest
and
herbal
spice
medium
bodied
dry
finish
overall
a
pleasant
surprise
good
flavor
all
around
with
some
grainy
heft
to
it
overall
not
the
hoppiest
pillsnot
that
they
are
supposed
to
be
but
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
i
have
had
the
chance
to
drink
it
is
perfect
for
drinking
in
hot
and
humid
weather
tough
to
score
this
one
to
style
for
appearance
as
its
listed
as
a
german
pils
for
what
it
is
the
cloudiness
and
color
would
be
expected
realy
smooth
and
easy
drinking
hoppy
pils
for
the
summer
o
a
refreshing
and
very
flavorful
lager
perfect
for
a
hot
evening
d
goes
down
easy
as
youd
expect
for
a
beer
often
served
in
1l
steins
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
pilsner
nothing
unique
to
it
except
for
a
slightly
higher
than
average
bitterness
its
a
summer
drinking
pils
that
you
can
drink
a
few
of
with
some
burgers
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
foodery
bottle
shop
in
philadelphia
pa
drank
this
a
few
hours
ago
so
i
dont
remember
much
what
i
do
remember
clearly
is
that
the
sweetness
of
the
german
malts
really
balance
out
the
bitterness
of
those
noble
hops
an
unfiltered
offering
from
a
fine
brew
house
a
very
nice
beer
overall
slightly
above
average
pilsner
this
is
meant
for
the
summer
for
sure
because
it
goes
down
like
water
the
taste
is
decent
but
ive
had
better
pilsners
out
of
the
bottle
on
23
nov
not
too
much
aroma
very
nice
balance
throughout
still
the
sbc
stubbie
i
believe
overall
a
pretty
good
pils
which
admittedly
isnt
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
certainly
worth
a
try
if
youre
looking
for
something
thirst
quenching
on
a
hot
day
cheers
crisp
and
clean
with
no
aftertaste
a
flavorful
brew
thats
not
over
aggressive
pours
a
hazy
light
gold
decent
head
a
bit
of
lacing
smells
of
wheat
and
white
bread
crusts
some
floral
notes
not
much
hops
taste
is
yeasty
lemony
and
refreshing
very
little
hops
carbonation
is
perfect
this
is
an
easy
drinker
and
a
solid
pilsner
chalk
one
up
to
the
latrobe
brew
dudes
good
work
on
the
contract
brew
fellas
drinkability
nicely
quaffable
beer
somewhat
refreshing
and
nicely
hopped
pilsner
this
beer
goes
down
quickly
and
has
a
nice
flavor
profile
golden
with
a
small
froth
of
white
head
that
retains
as
a
ring
through
the
session
aroma
is
faint
but
i
get
fresh
hay
flavors
are
undeniably
german
pils
clean
and
crisp
dry
grassiness
a
little
sweetness
kicks
in
from
the
malt
almost
honey
like
easy
drinking
and
quite
enjoyable
d
this
is
an
exceptionally
drinkable
beer
discovered
through
my
search
for
a
kellerzwickel
extremely
drinkable
and
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
in
quite
a
while
much
more
characterful
than
many
examples
out
there
and
most
definitely
sessionable
by
american
standards
i
could
drink
this
all
night
long
dry
bananas
that
get
popped
in
the
middle
by
a
dry
fist
of
pilsner
malts
and
german
earthy
grassy
hops
the
finish
is
a
bit
bitter
not
good
hoppy
bitter
but
still
leaves
you
thirsty
for
more
the
dry
palate
with
a
little
sweetness
helps
too
session
beer
this
one
fits
the
bill
pretty
well
and
i
could
easily
have
had
more
than
one
in
a
sitting
its
too
bad
this
style
isnt
more
popular
since
it
combines
the
drinkability
of
a
pils
with
the
body
and
hue
of
a
wheat
beer
i
know
its
fall
but
its
seasonals
like
this
that
make
me
wish
that
summer
was
still
here
although
upon
having
it
again
it
was
rather
heavy
handed
and
banana
lager
tang
i
hope
you
get
a
good
one
but
i
think
this
may
be
a
one
time
brewing
making
it
great
or
not
so
great
in
a
given
year
so
far
2010
great
2011
a
bit
above
average
and
ferment
funky
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
decent
beer
overall
but
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
the
beer
has
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
to
it
with
a
1
head
that
dissaptes
quickly
with
just
a
little
lace
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
nice
and
hoppy
this
pils
has
a
nice
hop
taste
to
it
and
i
smooth
not
very
carbonated
great
mouth
feel
and
is
very
drinkable
pours
cloudy
yellow
with
a
mushroom
cloud
of
white
foam
that
quickly
dissipitated
a
biere
de
garde
keller
element
with
the
pils
nice
is
you
appreciate
the
keller
above
average
mouthfeel
good
drinkability
a
little
lemon
a
little
pils
malt
good
fall
refreshment
i
hate
to
say
it
but
this
would
be
a
great
cross
over
beer
i
just
dont
like
that
term
but
it
would
work
well
for
that
purpose
its
really
well
done
and
i
will
be
buying
more
of
this
poured
ontap
a
hazed
dirty
blonde
colored
beer
head
is
small
and
leaves
little
lace
smell
is
hoppy
with
some
german
pilsner
malt
backing
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
sour
euro
hops
and
pilsner2row
barley
malt
a
bit
of
tobacco
leafyness
but
otherwise
a
well
balanced
beer
light
bodied
and
easy
drinking
despite
the
decidedly
filtered
look
here
this
had
everything
that
you
would
want
in
a
keller
bier
refreshing
citrus
flavor
well
balanced
bitterness
and
i
liked
the
crisp
snap
that
the
pils
malts
brought
to
this
tasty
and
refreshing
im
glad
to
see
that
they
now
have
this
one
out
in
bottles
definitely
unfiltered
and
with
a
completely
different
profile
than
a
normal
pilsner
id
say
this
nicely
fits
the
bill
for
a
keller
beer
pours
a
cloudy
light
yellow
with
a
relatively
thin
head
somewhat
light
in
the
nose
but
it
is
yeasty
lightly
hoppy
and
with
some
light
citrus
as
well
the
taste
is
much
more
robust
nice
yeasty
flavors
with
a
touch
of
citrus
and
nicely
herbal
hops
somewhere
between
a
pilsner
and
a
with
in
flavor
without
the
orange
and
coriander
very
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
slightly
prickly
in
the
mouth
but
a
wonderful
quencher
d
jam
this
beer
rocks
it
could
be
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
great
drinkability
and
flavor
with
a
near
perfect
mouthfeel
keller
pils
is
a
terrific
start
to
my
brew
day
nice
and
refreshing
psi
had
an
older
bottle
of
this
2
months
and
it
wasnt
as
goodskunky
definitely
a
seasonal
to
be
consumed
afap
d
i
like
the
way
the
keller
pils
gives
you
what
you
are
craving
it
has
yeast
so
it
is
a
true
unfiltered
lager
and
the
resins
soften
the
carbonation
that
is
there
for
a
light
refreshing
beer
great
for
a
late
august
day
i
am
really
a
fan
of
this
probably
more
than
my
rating
implies
very
easy
drinking
crisp
and
refreshing
particularly
considering
it
is
1
day
from
the
best
by
date
will
definitely
nab
a
fresh
sixer
next
spring
m
strong
carbonation
and
very
good
mouthfeel
for
the
style
perhaps
a
little
thicker
than
i
expected
but
enjoyable
and
very
drinkable
on
tap
at
the
biltmore
in
newton
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
pale
yellow
color
nice
contrasting
white
head
good
amount
of
carbonation
smell
had
a
bit
of
hay
and
fresh
cut
grass
taste
was
great
for
a
pilsener
snappy
bite
of
malt
with
just
enough
hops
to
coat
the
palate
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
refreshing
it
was
also
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
alcohol
abv
was
low
enough
to
make
this
a
great
afternoon
beer
or
a
good
session
beer
later
in
the
day
a
nice
accompaniment
to
lunch
this
is
a
quality
pils
that
i
could
have
easy
drank
from
a
much
larger
stein
in
much
bigger
quantities
very
true
to
its
german
heritage
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
terrific
it
has
a
crisp
clean
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
wonderful
bitter
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
good
as
well
it
has
a
damn
fine
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
smooth
and
easy
drinking
the
hops
offer
a
great
bitter
flavor
a
really
well
balanced
taste
it
goes
down
quick
with
a
clean
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
its
bold
in
taste
and
aroma
a
good
drinker
overall
the
malt
flavors
werent
quite
crisp
enough
to
knock
the
flavor
profile
into
the
next
level
but
even
as
it
is
i
found
this
to
be
a
refreshing
beer
worth
a
shot
drinkability
one
operative
word
for
this
beer
is
balanced
the
malt
and
hop
character
complement
each
other
and
balance
each
other
very
nicely
in
addition
they
blend
smoothly
into
each
other
each
sip
followed
the
last
quite
naturally
and
i
enjoyed
this
one
enough
that
it
was
also
my
choice
for
a
second
glass
very
drinkable
this
is
pretty
darn
drinkable
refreshing
and
crisp
well
worth
a
shot
a
solid
unfiltered
pils
different
than
filtered
pils
has
a
rawness
to
it
that
i
found
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
this
is
a
solid
pilsener
but
nothing
super
exciting
it
is
a
beer
that
is
well
made
to
style
with
a
nice
pale
color
good
noble
hop
aroma
and
flavor
and
a
solid
biscuity
malt
background
this
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
and
one
that
i
would
order
again
if
i
were
at
the
bar
watching
a
baseball
or
football
game
and
didnt
want
anything
too
challenging
thirstquenching
and
wellrounded
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
saaz
hops
and
small
sweet
fruitiness
in
the
taste
just
like
the
aroma
a
nice
hop
bite
and
a
small
fruitiness
a
small
bite
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
maltiness
in
the
aftertaste
a
clean
pils
nice
small
fruit
hint
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
and
light
bodied
with
a
smooth
feeling
all
the
way
through
easily
drinkable
while
still
being
interesting
great
seasonal
d
quite
refreshing
and
a
nearly
perfect
complement
for
the
dinner
it
was
united
with
good
flavors
and
aromas
an
allaround
solid
pilsner
absolutely
would
have
this
again
another
good
job
by
southampton
highly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
it
is
very
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
just
doesnt
have
the
punch
of
some
other
complex
beer
styles
but
big
but
this
is
a
good
representation
of
a
pilsner
and
well
above
average
overall
di
am
a
sucker
for
kellerbiers
and
this
one
is
no
exception
a
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
brew
that
is
perfect
for
summertime
drinking
hazy
lemon
yellow
with
a
snow
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
looking
lace
on
the
glass
untoasted
grain
and
pungent
noble
hops
with
a
touch
of
lemon
sugar
cookie
in
the
aroma
this
is
an
excellent
pils
that
really
tastes
like
what
i
would
imagine
a
really
fresh
example
of
a
german
or
czech
pils
might
taste
like
soft
lemon
and
fresh
bread
dough
with
a
nice
snap
of
noble
hop
bitterness
finishes
dry
and
clean
medium
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
a
great
lawnmowersession
beer
snappy
and
crisp
some
dry
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
suggest
hops
but
not
in
an
overt
way
mild
pilsner
malt
sweetness
not
overpowering
it
blends
5050
with
the
noble
hop
bitterness
let
it
warm
up
a
bit
and
it
has
a
little
more
depth
to
it
solidly
crafted
a
pils
for
hot
weather
in
whatever
quantity
you
choose
my
only
complaint
is
that
its
apparently
a
seasonal
and
will
probably
soon
be
disappearing
from
the
shelves
ive
been
back
to
julios
and
purchased
several
additional
6packs
but
would
love
to
be
able
to
do
so
throughout
the
year
d
very
drinkable
it
has
a
reasonable
abv
it
has
a
good
feel
to
it
and
nice
flavors
that
are
not
overwhelming
making
it
a
great
summer
beer
to
drink
d
this
is
very
drinkable
pilsner
and
another
solid
offering
from
southampton
this
is
good
interpretation
of
the
style
but
there
are
some
different
flavors
working
here
that
make
this
one
stand
out
i
picked
this
one
up
as
a
single
and
wish
i
bought
a
6pk
i
found
this
beer
in
moon
at
the
beer
store
and
i
snagged
the
last
remaining
sixer
just
based
off
of
the
buzz
ive
heard
great
looking
pils
really
rushes
the
palate
and
senses
with
fresh
hops
this
is
a
varietal

heard

years
was

brilliant

even
lacing
down
the

the

has
a

over
it
like

floating
in
the
delicious

comes
and
climbs

beneath

flavor
is
aggressive
with
a
biting
hop
edge
of
citrus
fruit
amongst
a
great
bready
light
biscuit
pale

additions
smooth
lagering
shows
off
what
most

attempt
to
do

te

a
german
pils
is
supposed
to
check
in
with
overall
this
is
excellent
stuff
its
something
else
to
see
heads
and
shoulders
above
the
other
12
ounce
offerings
in
bottle
a
go
to
summer
offering
that
may
have
to
track
down
a
whole
case
of
i
only
grabbed
six
at
my
local
because
thats
all
that
was
left
in
the
cooler
d
wow
this
is
a
super
drinkable
refreshing
summer
beer
this
is
a
refreshing
literally
departure
from
the
high
abv
nonsessionable
beers
out
there
highly
recommended
d
solid
allaround
great
example
of
a
great
and
under
appreciated
style
could
drink
this
all
night
nicely
done
another
good
offerinng
from
southampton
incredibly
drinkable
nice
going

d
a
well
made
drinkable
pilsner

easy

interesting
twist
on
the
style
great
eveningontheporch
beer
d
easy
drinking
pilsner
with
a
nice
crisp
flavor
thats
pretty
solid
all
around
although
i
could
have
done
without
the
hint
of
butter
and
average
appearance
d
solid
this
would
go
down
in
about
5
minutes
on
a
hot
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
this
one
hit
the
spot
nicely
when
it
comes
to
pils
however
my
usually
goes
to
victory
prima
glad
i
grabbed
this
one
and
ill
probably
go
back
to
it
a
few
more
times
this
summer
season
now
that
noble
pils
is
gone
overall
a
superior
example
of
the
style
fresh
fresh
fresh
d
very
drinkable
and
only
5
i
was
fooled
by
that
although
in
retrospect
it
did
go
down
very
easily
more
grassy
notes
cinnamon
like
spice
noble
hops
drying
things
out
worthy
sessioner
decent
with
a
lot
if
different
types
of
food
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
is
worth
a
try
at
least
too
similar
to
the
macros
for
me
although
to
their
credit
there
is
a
good
hop
finish
to
this
beer
thin
body
with
a
high
level
of
carbonation
even
for
the
style
goes
down
pretty
well
a
bit
more
bitter
and
spicy
than
some
other
american
pilsners
i
have
had
which
kinda
works
in
this
instance
not
bad
the
taste
is
quite
tart
through
and
through
a
number
of
reviewers
pegged
this
with
hallertau
hops
and
that
could
very
well
be
there
is
nothing
estery
or
fruity
about
the
hops
just
the
dryish
leafy
bittering
quality
that
you
find
in
this
type
there
is
a
lemony
acidic
quality
to
the
beer
that
complements
the
dry
hop
quite
well
there
is
some
grainy
and
grassy
qualities
a
noticeable
lagery
mouthfeel
and
pricklishness
a
slight
carbonation
a
touch
of
soury
herbalness
and
you
have
this
beer
in
a
nutshell
it
is
refreshing
light
bodied
a
good
summer
lager
all
the
way
around
drinkability
a
good
quality
pils
and
a
refreshing
way
to
beat
the
heat
here
in
miserable
muggy
ole
georgia
d
goes
down
very
easy
not
filling
not
much
of
a
kick
but
a
fantastic
beer
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
f
long
bitterness
some
astringent
hops
as
well
grassy
and
spicy
hops
with
quite
a
bit
of
bitterness
a
little
light
malty
flavors
and
sweetness
linger
but
mostly
just
hops
this
is
more
like
an
american
pale
wheat
lager
or
something
rather
than
german
pils
kinda
tasty
but
heavier
and
much
less
drinkable
than
i
would
have
liked
i
have
tried
to
be
fair
to
this
beer
and
i
admit
that
i
do
not
have
a
lot
of
experience
with
this
style
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
southampton
double
white
o
if
this
was
available
locally
and
inexpensive
it
would
be
a
great
summer
beer
had
a
bottle
at
liberty
st
tavern
im
always
happy
to
see
an
unfiltered
keller
pils
though
i
would
have
liked
a
little
more
of
the
earthy
character
that
sets
these
apart
from
a
regular
german
pilsner
the
hallertauer
tradition
hops
dominate
with
a
herbal
mix
of
citrus
spice
and
floral
notes
the
malts
are
pretty
mellow
but
marked
by
fresh
bread
notes
no
matter
how
you
look
at
it
this
is
a
very
tasty
pils
d
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
the
summer
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
drinkability
i
would
have
this
again
on
a
warm
summer
day
i
recommend
this
to
those
seeking
a
mildly
hoppy
and
distinct
open
with
a
classic
pilsner
finish
id
be
happy
to
have
cases
of
this
lying
around
for
the
summer
months
for
some
occasions
i
might
recommend
drinking
this
from
the
bottle
as
opposed
to
pouring
it
into
a
glass
depending
on
your
mood
from
the
bottle
the
flavors
are
a
bit
more
focused
or
concentrated
the
bitterness
enhanced
into
the
glass
everything
is
lightened
and
perhaps
a
bit
smoother
either
way
its
good
drinkin
the
southampton
keller
pils
had
a
light
body
in
terms
of
its
supporting
malts
but
each
taste
seemed
enhanced
and
a
step
forward
for
the
ale
note
there
is
a
sh
preprohibition
pils
listed
on
the
site
that
is
labeled
as
a
keller
bier
however
i
do
not
feel
that
this
is
the
same
beer
as
this
beer
does
even
come
close
to
having
the
body
of
a
keller
bier
and
this
is
a
new
bottled
seasonal
which
clearly
identifies
this
beer
as
a
pils
very
plane
and
simple
but
slaughered
by
the
reast
of
the
german
field
just
a
ordinary
pale
lager
nothing
special
keg
of
veltins
pilsner
drank
buy
unfortunately
the
taste
is
kind
of
foul
a
textbook
pilsner
with
average
noble
hop
taste
significant
carbonation
crisp
drinkable
and
refreshing
not
going
to
blow
you
away
by
any
means
but
sticks
true
to
its
style
o
very
easy
to
drink
ill
be
synthetic
this
is
like
drinking
a
daisy
i
really
this
a
solid
affordable
german
import
a
thinnerbodied
urquell
almost
this
makes
me
want
to
go
out
and
find
a
jever
to
compare
it
with
i
think
this
has
a
slightly
more
mineralish
flavor
than
that
brand
my
favorite
authentic
pils
but
is
fairly
similar
for
1
29
a
bottle
id
definitely
have
this
again
o
real
german
pure
beer
a
delicious
pilsner
with
a
classic
balance
between
hops
malt
and
yeast
if
you
are
a
fan
of
exceptionally
hoppy
beer
then
this
may
seem
to
fall
short
but
i
think
this
is
a
perfect
example
of
why
german
beers
in
many
ways
still
set
the
standard
the
hops
are
bitter
but
not
overthetop
aromatic
and
provide
a
fine
counterbalance
to
its
essentially
malty
character
an
excellent
value

at
binnys
in
chicago
another
fine
german
pilsener
that
is
this
is
on
par
for
the
style
o
i
cant
think
of
a
lager
beer
that
tops
this
one
it
goes
great
with
fries
and
schnitzel
or
pizza
and
even
spaghettis
with
red
sauce
plus
it
leaves
no
hangover
when
you
drink
a
few
more
of
this
beer
which
is
brewed
according
to
the
strict
german
purity
laws
if
you
like
lagers
veltins
is
a
must
try
o
a
decent
pils
overall
something
to
quaff
without
thinking
but
still
wont
take
the
place
of
a
trumer
or
eku
pils
o
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
but
nothing
really
stands
out
in
the
taste
when
it
is
compared
to
the
top
beers
in
the
style
above
average
german
pilsner
a
bit
more
malty
and
flavorful
won
best
pilsner
at
the
2007
world
beer
awards
i
love
the
dortmunder
style
german
beers
my
family
home
town
of
hagen
is
in
that
region
i
have
noticed
that
there
is
a
consistent
lack
of
appreciation
for
german
lagers
these
styles
of
beer
are
among
the
worlds
favorites
the
balance
achieved
is
nearly
perfect
for
my
tastes
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
87
also
this
is
probably
the
cheapest
beer
i
have
drank
in
2013as
only
0
69
euros
for
0
5litres
from
aldi
overall
it
would
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
was
any
better
than
the
other
industrial
euro
lagers
it
doesnt
speak
much
for
the
german
brewing
tradition
except
for
being
clean
and
inoffensive
on
tap
at
the
kaiserhof
in
san
diego
overall
a
decent
every
day
german
pilsner
c
o
goes
down
easy
somewhat
tasty
not
filling
mild
kick
this
was
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
night
not
sure
i
would
enjoy
this
as
much
any
other
time
of
year
but
it
is
definitely
a
great
for
a
summer
night

soso
above
average
for
most
lagers
but
only
middling
when
compared
to
other
german
pilseners
a
hint
of
noble
hops
and
a
more
obvious
bitterness
but
otherwise
this
doesnt
stray
far
from
the
standard
lager
template
no
need
to
seek
it
out
bit
of
a
skunky
smelll
to
start
which
quickly
blows
off
this
looked
reasonably
pleasant
typically
medium
yellow
for
the
style
this
kept
some
wispy
head
throughout
but
showed
minimal
beading
and
lacing
a
bit
hollowy
thin
all
and
all
and
just
overly
dominated
by
a
carbonic
edge
which
creates
an
atypically
unpleseant
bitter
edge
a
bit
too
malty
for
my
taste
and
there
isnt
much
harmony
in
the
integreation
of
these
two
elements
pours
a
nice
clear
amber
with
a
decent
white
head
typical
but
still
appealing
well
it
is
a
pilsner
strong
aroma
has
a
malty
core
and
a
robust
fruity
overtone
pear
and
apple
with
a
touch
of
banana
flavor
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
bitter
hoppy
undertone
and
a
bit
of
fruity
sweetness
body
is
a
bit
thicker
than
i
expect
with
this
sort
of
beer
and
is
quite
fizzy
im
not
a
pilsner
fan
preferring
dark
beers
such
as
stouts
but
i
will
give
any
good
beer
a
try
regardless
of
variety
o
although
very
bitter
and
unlike
any
pilsener
ive
personally
tried
its
enjoyable
and
very
classically
german
overall
quite
average
yes
pilsner
but
could
be
better
to
add
more
carbonation
to
bring
more
refreshing
touch
to
palate
drinkable
as
industrial

because
it
is
nostalgic
love
drinking
this
out
on
the
wandernweg
in
sauerland
the
appearance
is
light
and
clean
taste
is
not
overpowering
and
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
watery
but
is
very
refreshing
in
summer
great
water
source
that
makes
this
pilsner
taste
so
fresh
what
i
like
about
this
beer
is
that
it
is
always
reliable
and
i
know
i
can
go
back
to
it
when
i
just
want
a
fresh
cold
beer
and
not
worry
about
taking
tasting
notes
it
doesnt
produce
the
excitement
of
craft
beer
and
its
not
innovative
in
any
way
its
just
a
fine
and
mature
product
for
what
its
worth
it
does
the
job
perfectly
for
me
overall
not
too
sweet
not
full
bodied
but
easy
to
drink
a
very
standard
pilsener
imho
o
very
easy
to
drink
very
tasty
this
is
how
i
like
my
pils
herbal
earthy
and
grassy
noble
hop
flavors
hit
the
tongue
first
followed
by
a
touch
of
sweet
bready
pils
malt
it
dries
up
quickly
in
the
finish
ending
with
a
bitter
herbal
and
mineral
bite
very
light
and
dry
punchy
but
refreshing
pours
a
pale
yellor
with
light
head
aroma
is
sweet
malts
and
a
little
floral
scent
taste
is
sweet
with
herbal
flavors
and
a
light
hop
bitterness
in
the
finishing
aftertaste
is
typical
german
pilsner
with
a
heavy
sweetness
and
light
herbal
hops
pretty
much
your
average
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
note
a
second
tasting
of
this
a
couple
weeks
later
and
there
were
metallic
notes
in
the
aroma
and
taste
interfering
with
positive
qualities
the
body
was
good
a
bit
fuller
than
is
typical
for
the
style
which
i
enjoyed
drinkability
was
good
i
could
have
a
couple
of
these
overall
a
decent
version
of
the
style
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
for
a
cheaper
pilsener
veltins
is
good
i
respect
that
they
do
not
use
hop
extract
the
use
of
real
hops
adds
a
lot
to
this
beer
which
exceeded

one
of
my
favorite
pilsner
beers
for
sure
highly
recommend
d
nice
german
pilsener
i
was
in
paderborn
germany
for
a
few
days
and
of
course
was
very
excited
about
trying
as
many
new
pilsners
as
i
could
my
hotel
had
veltins
which
were
available
in
many
sizes
including
a
full
liter
the
beer
was
kinda
light
on
flavor
and
color
aroma
was
pretty
good
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
outstanding
the
is
some
bitterness
and
dryness
in
this
beer
which
makes
it
an
average
german
beer
siply
not
spectacular
overall
maybe
intended
for
a
light
beer
drinking
market
such
as
greece
an
average
pils
with
nothing
too
special
but
also
nothing
really
bad
about
it
either
its
not
as
bitter
as
i
expected
from
the
nose
there
are
some
toasty
malts
and
it
finishes
dry
its
not
memorable
though
just
sort
of
passes
through
as
a
thirstquencher
but
not
much
else
it
felt
like
it
got
metallic
as
i
went
through
the
glass
too
not
bad
but
probably
not
something
id
buy
again
it
brought
back
happy
times
and
the
days
of
my
courting
while
in
germany
back
in
the
70s
glad
i
stumbled
across
it
again
i
have
two
old
veltins
glasses
that
i
use
to
review
lagers
and
pilsners
in
d
a
nice
pilsener
wil
surely
drink
this
again
my
favorite
of
this
years
holiday
after
the
mythos
red
sharp
hop
on
the
tongue
upfront
combined
with
a
bit
of
carbonation
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
hoppy
not
complex
yet
nicely
balanced
and
dry
finishes
tart
and
slightly
bitter
making
this
pretty
good
for
the
type
a
good
and
fairly
common
pilsner
that
is
worth
trying
drinkability
not
much
goin
here
just
a
pretty
simple
slightly
skunkedoff
pilsner
not
unenjoyable
but
not
one
to
have
again
give
me
a
prima
pils
any
day
not
a
lot
to
it
but
reccomended
d
about
as
drinkable
as
cold
water
and
about
as
flavourful
it
was
kind
of
noisy
and
dim
when
i
tried
this
beer
so
i
was
a
little
distracted
its
an
easy
drinking
pils
pours
a
pale
yellow
huge
long
lasting
head
and
lots
of
lacing
aroma
of
continental
malt
and
a
small
faint
hint
of
charred
wood
flavor
of
german
pils
and
a
firm
hop
presence
as
much
flavor
as
blunt
bitterness
quite
a
well
crafted
and
refreshing
pils
dont
let
the
boring
looking
can
turn
you
off
this
lager
d
very
drinkable
wellbalanced
malts
and
hops
can
drink
more
than
a
couple
and
did
light
yellow
in
color
head
disappears
quickly
but
leaves
nice
lace
smells
light
and
grainy
slightly
sweet
lots
of
hops
a
little
too
much
carbonation
its
thin
and
light
but
not
watery
theres
a
definite
note
of
maltsweet
dextrins
that
become
more
apparent
if
you
let
it
warm
up
a
little
it
finishes
with
a
slight
peppery
tingle
in
the
throat
not
a
particularly
complex
brew
but
i
suppose
thats
expected
for
a
lager
d
a
really
enjoyable
german
pilsner
which
went
well
with
my
cheese
pizza
easy
to
drink
with
a
distinctive
dextrin
sweetness
playing
off
of
a
woody
hops
gives
it
a
unique
slot
in
the
german
pilsner
style
md
semiclean
moderate
in
carbonation
mediumbodied
for
the
mild
flavour
profile
all
in
all
not
a
bad
pilsener
but
not
something
id
go
for
a
second
pint
i
have
tried
it
on
tap
as
well
the
rake
nr
the
borough
market
london
which
was
superior
to
this
bottled
version
having
this
beer
in
sibiu
romania
its
interesting
given
that
i
just
read
my
last
review
which
is
just
before
this
one
the
body
is
good
but
sweeter
than
a
good
pils
ditto
the
flavor
body
and
finish
so
the
bottom
line
is
slightly
different
but
neither
better
nor
worse
just
slightly
different
very
nice
if
these
where
on
tap
locally
i
could
pound
them
all
day
on
a
nice
sunny
patio
notes
i
suspect
this
is
better
on
tap
than
the
greenbottled
version
we
get
in
the
us
but
if
i
could
get
it
to
taste
like
this
in
the
bottles
this
would
make
a
decent
summer
pilsner
a
good
start
to
the
evening
on
a
hot
summer
day
id
still
take
a
victory
prima
pils
over
this
and
other
pilsners
d
i
was
incredibly
impressed
with
this
pilsener
it
is
still
entirely
pilsener
flavors
just
more
complex
and
more
of
them
not
to
mention
4
8
abv
aint
bad
definitely
worth
a
try
and
maybe
a
good
way
to
convert
your
dingus
friend
who
only
drinks
macro
lagers
slight
citrus
tones
in
the
hops
and
a
good
sweet
baked
bread
malt
crisp
hop
profile
in
the
flavour
good
malts
to
balance
it
out
nice
and
clean
carbonation
a
good
summer
beer
had
this
with
dinner
as
a
pretasting
session
with
the
one
and
only
ba
blackhaddock
poured
your
typical
golden
lager
color
into
his
2l
veltins
glass
lovely
frothy
white
head
which
is
to
be
expected
of
a
german
lager
the
taste
perfectly
mirrors
the
smell
malts
plain
and
simple
taste
is
malty
with
subtle
floral
hints
bottom
line
is
that
this
is
a
better
than
average
german
lager
and
one
of
the
best
ones
ive
had
out
of
a
bottle
well
worth
a
try
if
you
fancy
yourself
a
lager
lover
d
i
quite
like
this
pilsener
itss
increadibly
easy
to
drink
and
is
very
refreshing
nice
flavour
and
nice
presentation
as
well
i
will
certainly
be
buying
this
beer
again
an
okay
pilsener
which
would
probably
have
far
more
justice
done
to
it
if
it
were
more
fresh
and
not
so
close
to
the
best
before
date
this
was
a
pretty
drinkable
brew
nothing
to
put
in
the
beer
hall
of
fame
but
enjoyable
and
pretty
typical
in
style
for
a
pils
worth
checking
out
if
you
come
across
it
d
very
enjoyable
d
almost
got
a
5
up
in
this
piece
but
pilseners
arent
my
forte
and
i
think
i
need
some
more
experience
before
i

this
beer
is
an
easy
drinking
one
with
a
fresh
crisp
feel
taste
that
could
be
drunk
anytime
and
easily
consumable
for
quite
a
few
on
a
hot
summer
day
worth
a
tryi
enjoyed
this
one
overall
a
good
middle
of
the
pack
pils
d
this
is
much
more
drinkable
than
others
of
its
ilk
due
to
the
more
balanced
and
maltysweet
flavors
that
dont
have
the
aggressive
peppery
notes
of
some
czech
and
german
pils
a
refreshing
and
pleasant
pilsner
worth
trying
if
you
like
the
style
d
veltins
is
actually
a
very
drinkable
pilsener
perhaps
not
the
best
in
each
category
id
say
but
certainly
nothing
to
shake
a
stick
at
an
above
average
offering
that
would
suit
fans
of
this
style
or
lagers
in
general
overall
an
ok
pils
a
few
too
many
macro
hints
to
be
better
than
average
worth
a
try
maybe
once
picked
up
a
bottle
at
finger
lakes
beverage
center
in
ithaca
i
was
ecited
to
try
a
new
pilsner
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
little
more
of
a
euro
pale
lager
than
anything
else
it
was
pretty
bland
with
a
bready
flavor
and
aroma
and
a
touch
not
enough
of
grassy
hops
it
could
be
worse
but
its
not
really
worth
trying
overall
veltins
is
an
elegant
round
beer
i
would
recommend
it
for
anyone
who
would
like
to
taste
a
nice
example
of
a
german
pilsner
overall
dull
but
oh
so
drinkable
very
nice
but
can
you
believe
that
opus
charged
me
5
50
for
a
10
oz
poor
of
this
drinkability
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
pilsner
that
is
good
on
a
warm
day
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
golden
color
with
a
slight
orange
tinge
and
a
pillowy
offwhite
head
smell
is
primarily
sweet
with
malt
slightly
spiced
taste
is
similar
to
the
nose
although
the
hops
are
well
balanced
with
the
malt
there
could
be
more
there
is
also
a
slight
metallic
taste
that
ruins
the
experience
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
has
a
velvety
consistency
this
beer
is
pretty
decent
even
with
the
nasty
metallic
taste
i
would
be
interested
to
try
a
fresher
bottle
pretty
drinkable
given
the
good
balance
of
hops
and
malt
as
well
as
the
light
body
poured
out
a
golden
yellow
color
thin
filmy
white
head
nose
had
a
strong
pilsner
malty
note
with
some
spicy
hops
backing
it
up
the
taste
was
a
bit
heavy
but
pleanest
bready
tiny
bit
of
hops
very
full
flavored
and
refreshing
has
a
medium
carbonaiton
mouthfeel
appropriate
for
the
style
finishes
smooth
and
refreshing
with
a
slightly
bitter
bite
at
the
end
quite
nice
theres
just
enough
here
to
keep
it
on
the
dinner
table
yet
it
would
also
serve
extremely
well
at
a
sporting
event
during
the
summer
flavorful
and
refreshing
taste
was
bitter
with
malty
backbone
with
the
prickly
sensation
of
the
carbonation
also
some
breadiness
and
a
dry
finish
to
me
a
very
good
pilsener
too
bad
for
the
smell
but
taste
was
as
good
as
it
gets
it
could
be
a
little
more
hoppy
but
thats
it
mouthfeel
drinkability
the
beer
has
a
very
slick
light
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
well
carbonated
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
the
beer
goes
well
with
food
i
had
this
with
burritos
on
tap
at
the
cock
bull
in
covington
ky
appropriate
medium
straw
color
not
quite
crisp
but
still
pleasantly
sharp
malt
profile
hopping
was
nondescript
but
adequate
some
hardwater
mineral
notes
finish
was
clean
with
a
lingering
slightly
acidic
hop
bite
smooth
and
creamy
in
the
mouth
but
light
in
body
an
easy
drinker
and
a
good
solid
pils
cheers
nothing
too
special
here
just
a
solid
pilsner
with
no
real
weaknesses
and
no
special
strengths
pours
a
fizzy
golden
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
yet
it
does
leave
nice
lacings
the
smell
is
crisp
and
hoppy
it
tastes
wellhopped
one
of
the
better
tasting
german
pilseners
ive
had
im
really
surprised
this
beer
is
rated
so
low
im
actually
quiet
impressed
the
mouthfeel
is
adequate
for
the
style
and
the
drinkability
has
got
to
be
great
because
im
sucking
these
ones
down
in
a
hurry
cheers
nice
light
beer
even
though
its
not
a
light
beer
all
in
all
a
very
serviceable
german
pils
that
id
enjoy
on
those
hot
summer
days

you
would
expect
from

lots
and
lots

the

is
focused
squarely
on
the
herbal
hops
with
a
dry
finish
thankfully
none
of
the
skunkiness
i
have
experienced
from
other
popular
pilsners
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
hearty
food
but
not
necessarily
something
i
would
want
to
drink
a
bunch
of
still
a
perfectly
good
pilsner
yet
another
euro
pils
in
da
can
this
is
ok
but
really
a
shadow
of
konig
or
topvar
not
enough
body
and
hops
and
not
much
of
a
finish
drinkable
yes
in
the
way
that
becks
is
better
than
canadian
seems
there
is
too
many
german
lagers
in
a
can
available
and
not
enough
duppelbocks
and
vienna
lagers
the
beer
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
composed
of
rather
large
bubbles
that
fell
to
slightly
ring
the
top
ofthe
glass
the
nose
was
slightly
grainey
and
touched
with
a
hint
of
noble
hop
i
would
like
a
little
more
gusto
flavorwise
the
flavor
was
much
the
same
a
big
dose
of
graineyness
hovering
over
a
very
light
bed
of
spicey
noble
hop
the
feel
was
light
and
bubbly
very
refreshing
on
a
summer
night
on
the
patio
of
our
local
watering
hole
drinkability
was
not
all
that
bad
it
was
easily
consumed
and
quenced
my
thirst
after
not
having
beer
for
a
few
days
of
being
sick
overall
average
but
refreshing
a
decent
german
pilsner
poured
out
to
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
good
head
typical
of
a
well
crafted
german
brew
odors
of
rice
and
bread
were
noted
taste
was
a
bit
one
sided
reminding
me
of
a
light
lager
flavors
of
hops
and
grain
were
most
present
as
was
a
touch
of
a
lemon
like
quality
on
the
finish
overall
quite
refreshing
and
crisp
worth
a
try
impression
glad
it
was
served
in
a
nice
glass
a
good
transition
for
your
yellowbeerdrinkingbuddies
the
case
of
the
six
pack
i
bought
says
the
best
german
pilsner
i
figured
it
probably
wasnt
true
but
it
still
might
be
good
so
i
bought
it
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
creamy
white
head
it
is
more
pale
than
other
pilsners
ive
had
sweet
smell
with
underlying
bitter
hop
aromas
the
sip
tastes
sweet
with
a
nice
bitterness
at
the
end
the
aftertaste
is
sweet
and
sicky
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
like
a
pilsner
to
be
but
well
balanced
for
what
it
is
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
nice
carbonation
overall
it
is
not
the
best
german
pilsner
ive
had
but
it
isnt
bad
either
it
is
good
enough
that
i
want
to
drink
the
other
five
bottles
instead
of
pawning
them
off
on
less
beer
educated
friends
who
would
just
get
drunk
with
it
on
the
other
hand
i
will
not
buy
it
again
this
is
okay
beer
i
guess
it
doesnt
change
my
mind
about
the
5
rule
which
i
just
made
up
that
says
that
5
of
european
lagers
are
actually
good
veltins
is
in
the
other
95
but
it
really
isnt
too
bad
in
the
final
reckoning
it
is
ultimately
forgettable
though
pours
a
hazy
goldenstraw
color
with
a
good
creamy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
very
long
with
some
lacing
grassy
and
flowery
aromas
bready
cracker
like
flavors
with
a
mild
sweetness
that
turns
hoppy
and
bitter
with
some
dryness
in
the
finish
medium
bodied
with
a
soft
but
kind
of
watery
mouthfeel
a
decent
pils
im
not
usually
pulled
in
by
fancy
bottles
but
this
one
was
sharp
dressed
thick
dense
pale
cream
colored

fades
slowly
leaving
a
few
random
strings
of
lace
pale
malt
crisp

in
the
aroma

brilliant
golden

with
a
few
medium
sized
bubbles
rising
briskly
from
the
bottom
of
the
tall
slender
pilsner
glass
lightly
sweet
pale
malt
mixed
with
a
solid
dose
of
spicy
and
floral
hop
flavors
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
theres
just
a
slight
grainy
flavor
thats
barely
noticeable
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
but
thicker
then
expected
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
the
flavor
is
light
but
theres
enough
hops
in
their
to
keep
it
enjoyable
at
12
a
12pack
it
would
make
a
good
gateway
beer
overall
a
strange
pilsener
light
character
light
bodied
rather
lite
overall
but
not
that
bad
the
funky
nose
is
something
else
though
a
nice
golden
pilsener
with
a
very
nice
white
head
that
leaves
a
ton
of
lace
around
my
glass
it
has
a
nice
grassy
sweet
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
hops
pretty
much
a
standard
german
pils
aroma
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
has
a
malty
sweetness
that
is
pretty
well
hidden
behind
a
generous
hopping
the
nice
hoppy
finish
of
this
beer
makes
it
stand
out
when
compared
to
other
macro
german
pilseners
i
definitely
will
be
revisiting
this
beer
in
the
future

it

bitterness
is
on
the
low
side
for
the
style
finishes
dry
grainy
and
spicy
not
too
bad
it
reminds
me
of
the
czech
style
of
pils
than
german
this
one
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
dies
off
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
a
little
grainy
but
theres
nothing
much
there
a
slight
skunkiness
it
has
a
metallic
taste
slightly
bitter
and
a
small
bit
of
malt
is
found
but
theres
not
much
to
this
beer
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
as
it
came
across
to
me
as
the
typical
euro
lager
drinkability

this
isnt
a
classic
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
but
is
rather
inexpensive
and
worth
a
look
a
light
sweetness
appears
at
around
the
halfway
point
but
i
feel
the
brew
lacks
the
mildly
sweet
malty
and
herbal
character
one
normally
expects
from
the
style
nice
should
try
beer
classic
bavarian
styling
from
start
to
finish
i
ordered
this
one
online
cuz
i
had
never
seen
it
in
a
store
it
reminds
me
of
radeburger
a
simple
straight
forward
german
pilsener
fairly
poor
head
retention
standard
german
nose
ie
spaten
warsteiner
mild
with
a
hint
of
malty
bitterness
taste
is
also
fairly
straightforward
with
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
finish
like
pilsner
urquel
it
is
safe
to
say
i
dont
think
too
highly
of
these
other
beers
i
have
compared
to
the
veltins
these
are
the
bud
millers
coors
of
germany
czech
rep
mostly
3
5s
here
though
cuz
it
is
better
than
average
but
nothing
exceptional
i
wish
usas
macros
were
this
decent
pours
a
yellowish
gold
color
with
one
finger
of
head
not
much
lacing
the
smell
is
classic
pilsener
with
a
malty
background
and
some
grassy
aromas
the
taste
is
light
a
little
sweet
balanced
malt
and
hops
the
body
is
very
light
but
the
drinkability
is
pretty
good
not
too
shabby
appearance
yellow
golden

with
a
nice
sized
frothy
white
head
leaves
nice
lacing
down
my

aroma
mild
sweetness
clean
grassy

profile
not
bad
at
all
clean
with
some
hops
taste
upfront
hop
bitterness
crisp
german
pils
a
bit
one
dimensional
and
boring
at
times
but
i
like
the
hop
bitterness
that
comes
through
the
flavors
are
of
grassy
herbal
hops
the
sweetness
is
balancing
but
very
nice
slightly
bready
mouthfeel
lighter
bodied
meant
for
the
summer
season
carbonation
was
a
bit
much
other
than
that
nothing
special
drinkability
a
nice
german
pils
that
is
decently
flavorful
and
refreshing
front
flavor
is
bright
and
crisp
with
hops
and
spicy
flavor
that
leads
a
honey
malt
into
the
wayward
valley
of
finish
served
on
tap
at
eli
cannons
arrived
in
my
pint
glass
a
pale
and
just
slightly
hazy
maize
yellow
with
a
moderate
layer
of
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
surprisingly
floral
hoppy
just
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
flavor
is
refreshing
and
crisp
theres
more
to
this
pilsener
than
i
expected
and
none
of
the
skunkiness
that
others
have
noted
taste
is
bitter
and
hoppy
at
first
hint
of
lemon
in
there
then
easing
into
a
nice
simple
sweet
malt
flavor
hops
come
back
for
a
clean
fresh
finish
body
is
light
and
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
i
could
drink
this
all
day
its
so
drinkable
not
sure
how
the
bottled
version
would
be
but
damn
tasty
on
tap
seems
like
a
perfect
summer
beer
plenty
of
flavor
not
too
heavy
or
alcoholic
goes
down
easy
pours
a
standard
clear
gold
under
a
two
finger
white
head
with
good
body
decent
staying
power
and
some
lacing
the
nose
is
slightly
skunked
at
initial
pour
then
morphing
into
pine
and
barley
notes
the
mouth
is
light
and
prickly
the
taste
is
classic
german
pils
lots
of
crisp
bordering
on
harsh
hoppy
bitterness
above
a
mild
malty
backbone
the
aftertaste
is
strongly
bitter
inviting
the
next
taste
its
much
better
on
tap
in
germany
but
still
a
very
drinkable
beer
zum
wohl
this
fine
pilsner
is
crystal
clear
with
a
flowery
aroma
it
is
not
as
hoppy
as
some
other
beers
in
the
style
this
beer
starts
with
a
slight
sweetness
reminiscent
of
honeysuckles
and
ends
with
a
dry
balanced
finish
that
seems
to
last
for
some
time
it
is
above
average
but
is
not
something
that
i
would
give
a
second
thought
about
what
youdid
expect
from
a
german
pilsner
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
that
typical
pale
malt
and
yeast
smell
that
so
many
of
these
type
beers
have
it
is
not
as
skunky
as
some
ive
tried
the
taste
is
awful
it
is
grainy
and
bitter
it
doesnt
smell
skunky
but
it
sure
as
hell
tastes
skunky
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
this
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
over
all
this
is
a
terrible
beer
it
looks
good
smells
good
and
has
good
mouthfeel
but
it
tastes
awful
its
one
and
done
for
me
at
first
impression
the
beer
looks
very
thin
and
watery
but
after
one
notes
its
massive
head
retention
and
lace
the
contrary
becomes
apparent
taste
is
mild
with
a
mildly
sharp
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
well
after
the
beer
is
gone
fairly
drinkable
but
somewhat
boring
a
rep
broght
me
a
sample
of
this
the
other
day
claiming
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
about
this
beer
and
how
it
was
huge
in
germany
etc
etc
i
wonder
if
he
had
ever
tasted
this
beer
it
poured
a
medium
yellow
straw
colour
with
a
decent
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
the
smell
was
crisp
and
a
bit
hoppy
with
a
weird
sort
of
metallic
tone
and
a
touch
of
le
skunk
the
taste
was
underwhelming
hoppy
in
that
german
pilsner
way
yet
it
left
a
long
odd
aftertaste
it
reminded
me
way
too
much
of
st
paulis
girl
and
becks
not
the
worst
beer
i
had
ever
had
but
not
at
all
worth
the
hype
and
definately
not
one
i
would
shell
out
7
50
a
six
pack
for
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
finishes
short
which
is
its
downfall
the
smell
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
nice
hops
presence
the
taste
is
nothing
fancy
very
simple
and
light
on
the
palate
lagers
typically
arent
my
style
of
choice
but
this
is
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
that
i
picked
up
on
a
whim
im
happy
with
it
label
proclaims
this
as
a
german
pilsner
beer
nothing
straying
toward
papery
but
not
too
offputting
hops
are
acidic
in
quality
and
have
a
slight
tobacco
sense
and
not
big
on
complexity
taste
like
a
kenzinger
a
nice
drinkable
german
style
beer
awesome
just
a
touch
of
haze
in
a
deep
straw
colored
liquid
topped
with
a
creamy
bubbly
bone
white
head
that
persists
forever
leaving
lots
of
stickies
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
crackery
bready
malt
aromas
are
nicely
balanced
with
a
bit
of
spicy
floral
hop
light
sulfur
rounds
out
the
nose
the
flavor
is
rich
bready
crackery
pilsner
malt
with
spicy
hop
to
counter
slight
metallic
flavor
towards
the
end
is
a
bit
off
putting
i
can
imagine
that
this
was
a
better
beer
when
fresher
but
i
just
noticed
that
this
can
is
best
by
july
2014
still
no
excuse
for
the
metallic
flavor
i
will
rate
as
is
and
hopefully
get
a
chance
to
sample
again
o
very
tasty
and
crisp
well
done
pils
especially
by
an
american
brewer
well
deserved
to
be
an
award
winner
have
only
had
this
on
tap
clean
and
crisp
always
refreshing
overall
a
very
solid
pils
i
still
think
troegs
sunshine
takes
the
prize
for
authenticity
while
victory
prima
takes
the
prize
for
flavor
in
the
sepa
german
pilsner
competition

a

this

for

overall
worth
getting
again
a
good
german
style
pilsner
isnt
alwayseasy
to
come
by
but
sly
fox
has
produced
a
very
good
example
with
this
beer
i
like
its
snappy
crisp
flavor
profile
and
the
herbs
and
grasses
are
nicely
placed
and
balanced
its
certainly
a
pilsner
worth
trying
and
one
that
most
everyone
will
like
o
i
really
like
this
pilsner
some
traditional
german
examples
are
pointlessly
bitter
and
dry
and
lack
the
flavor
to
back
it
up
this
is
a
really
nicely
balanced
example
with
a
good
complex

overall
a

but
not
super
awesome
it
is
a
very
nice
summer
beer
though
and
i
would
pick
it
up
again
perfectly
executed
pilsner
and
faithful
to
the
style
o
a
nicely
structured
pils
with
a
nice
fresh
hop
profile
and
easy
drinkability
this
is
a
fantastic
easy
drinking
pilsner
a
good
amount
of
flavor
on
this
and
stands
as
one
of
the
better
american
pilsners
this
is
a
kind
and
gentle
pils
it
drinks
so
easily
that
the
foam
doesnt
even
have
a
chance
to
fall
before
you
have
drained
the
glass
the
citrus
stays
sweet
and
the
small
tart
aspect
of
the
lemon
blends
with
the
yeasty
sour
this
beer
has
no
rough
edges
or
seams
its
mineral
quality
makes
it
especially
clean
and
refreshing
the
delicate
touch
of
spice
made
it
cheerful
you
can
picture
it
on
the
table
in
a
pitcher
easily
forthcoming
overall
i
dont
really
like
the
style
but
this
beer
is
quaff
able
o
an
excellent
beer
and
a
good
example
of
a
german
pils
i
could
drink
this
all
summer
along
with
prima
pils
and
stoudts
pils
big
fan
would
love
to
see
this
in
ky
highly
recommended
pale
straw
yellow
in
color
with
brilliant
clarity
poured
with
a

that

bready
and
biscuity
malt
and
herbal

flavors
hop
flavors
turn
a
bit
spicy
through
the
middle
along
with
a
lightly
citrus
tang
finishes
dryly
and
crisply
with
a
lingering
herbal
hop
bitterness
an
exceptionally
complex
crisp
refreshing
german
pilsner
this
beer
is
an
okay
pils
prima
pils
is
still
ruling
the
roost
on
this
one
and
stoudts
pils
is
much
better
as
well
this
isnt
a
bad
session
beer
the
can
is
a
definite
plus
in
this
regard
the
flavor
isnt
as
forward
as
i
would
like
i
did
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
wish
the
malt
was
good
as
the
intensely
bitter
hop
character
i
wouldnt
mind
a
some
of
these
at
the
tailgate
o
this
beer
seems
a
little
hoppier
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
style
almost
like
a
west
coast
take
on
a
classic
german
style
but
is
still
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
pils
great
summer
beer
and
another
reason
why
pa
brewers
make
the
best
craft
pils
an
excellent
summer
brew
i
could
easily
see
throwing
a
sixer
of
this
in
a
cooler
and
hitting
the
beach
for
the
afternoon
light
refreshing
tasty
and
clean
this
is
a
well
balanced
pils
im
quite
bummed
that
this
is
not
available
in
cleveland
it
would
be
an
easy
goto
beer
for
a
group
of
friends
no
matter
if
they
are
craft
beer
enthusiasts
or
simply
casual
beer
drinkers
strongly
bitter
and
crisp
taste
again
lots
of
aggressive
noble
hops
packing
grass
and
floral
earthy
flavors
nice
pils
malt
underneath
but
its
the
bitter
hops
that
dominate
this
beer
light
body
lively
carbonation
and
dry
finish
make
this
a
refreshing
pils
for
sure
overall
its
quite
good
o
very
good
taste
with
some
more
carbonation
the
mouthfeel
and
aroma
would
be
a
bit
better
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
clean
but
slightly
cloying
finish
with
bitter
aftertaste
overall
enjoyable
but
nothing
too
special
and
some
oddly
placed
flavors
would
drink
again
but
wont
pursue
o
not
a
mindblowing
experience
but
a
very
good
beer
its
nice
to
have
something
predictable
and
satisfying
it
should
be
a
staple
in
every
refrigerator
in
the
delaware
valley
straw
colored
in
appearance
with
little
head
and
no
retention
or
lacing
the
taste
is
mildly
hoppy
with
a
clean
finish
this
offering
was
overall
clean
and
crisp
but
a
little
thin
id
give
it
a
thumbs
up
nonetheless
but
certainly
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
crowd
pleaser
looking
forward
to
superbowl
xlvi
and
pikeland
pils
o
this
is
a
good
beer
for
those
spring
and
summer
days
when
mowing
the
lawn
and
such
really
well
priced
at
7
99
for
a
6
pack
a
well
made
beer
and
quite
enjoyable
at
that
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
i
wish
ergot
this
here
in
idaho
pours
a
transparent
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
the
nose
is
great
light
vienna
malts
hints
of
bread
and
dough
with
a
floral
perfumy
hop
and
light
note
of
grass
the
taste
has
vienna
and
pale
malts
lightly
toasted
bread
with
hints
of
dough
the
hop
balance
adds
perfumy
hops
and
some
light
grassy
notes
with
a
touch
of
resigny
hop
in
the
back
the
body
is
thicker
and
a
touch
viscous
with
a
nice
carbonation
very
tasty
but
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
for
a
pilsner
overall
its
not
quite
but
prima
pils
but
its
up
there
its
well
balanced
and
has
a
great
easy
drinking
taste
ill
be
sure
to
look
for
this
one
during
the
warmer
weather
especially
overall
not
my
favorite
style
but
an
easy
drinking
summer
beer
mixed
sixer
from
the
wegmans
shelf
i
like
113
ipa
and
was
happy
to
find
a
single
to
try
this
poured
from
the
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
tall
skinny
nice
bright
color
w
tight
head
crisp
hoppy
aroma
nice
crisp
hop
flavor
with
a
light
malt
accent
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
this
is
like
85
prima
pils
to
me
the
can
makes
it
a
great
choice
for
fishing
picnics
etc
will
pick
up
a
case
next
summer
for
sure
o
this
is
a
wellcrafted
american
pilsner
american
in
the
good
way
not
the
other
way
a
hard
one
to
do
but
a
would
say
quite
a
success
looks
a
lot
of
like
prima
outside
of
a
difference
in
carbonation
some
steady
bubbles
but
nothing
too
lively
golden
clear
with
a
smaller
white
head
palate
is
very
consistent
and
dry
doesnt
fall
off
completely
clean
like
a
the
prima
and
im
saying
that
because
i
had
them
along
side
each
other
but
still
clean
brisk
end
sufficient
hop
americans
are
getting
good
at
this
and
im
pretty
psyched
about
exceptional
product
a
hidden
gem
if
we
will
not
many
know
of
it
but
if
you
see
it
and
you
like
hoppy
pilsners
you
will
be
pleasantly
surprised
o
goes
down
easily
tasty
not
filling
low
kick
nice
representation
of
style
this
is
a
perfect
beer
for
a
hot
and
humid
nj
night
if
this
were
distributed
to
ma
it
quite
possibly
could
be
my
summer
go
to
beer
just
an
exceptionally
well
made
local
pils
o
the
crisp
fresh
malt
has
a
good
balance
with
the
hops
and
it
is
very
drinkable
there
is
no
sulfur
notes
or
corn
notes
it
is
all
fresh
malt
and
hops
easy
to
drink
as
it
is
extremely
light
and
refreshing
a
perfect
summer
beer
the
balance
of
this
beer
really
increases
its
appeal
lucky
for
me
topnotch
german
pilsners
are
prevalent
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
this
is
one
that
i
will
be
returning
to
because
it
is
definitely
a
solid
offering

oh
yea

a

pale
and
clear
very
typical
and
pleasing
to
me
smells
of
grainy
sweet
malts
some
lager
yeast
smells
that
i
still
cant
describe
very
well
earthy
hops
come
through
in
the
finish
for
a
nice
balance
to
the
malts
thin
bodied
medium
high

im
going
to
enjoy
this
one
and
may
more
if
and
when
i
go
back
to
ny
to
pick
some
up
overall
a
good
beer
and
very
portable
2
15
a
single
i
like
it
but
pikeland
pils
is
fairly
onedimensional
relying
almost
exclusively
on
grassy
hop
flavors
i
dont
necessarily
think
that
it
is
categorically
a
bad
thing
but
i
would
like
a
little
bit
more
this
beer
is
much
like
all
the
other
pilsners
out
there
its
got
the
tradional
grassy
flavor
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
could
totally
use
mmore
hops
no
doubt
about
that
this
beer
has
a
fizzy
white
head
and
a
golden
yellow
color
the
aroma
is
the
best
part
of
the
beer
i
feel
that
this
beer
is
much
too
watered
down
d
great
drinkability
look
this
is
not
prima
pils
but
this
is
an
awesome
pilsner
to
enjoy
when
you
dont
want
to
mangle
your
palate
great
flavor
that
can
be
gulped
mouthfeel
was
light
bodied
and
amply
carbonated
drinkability
is
quite
high
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
sold
pils
with
a
low
abv
you
could
definitely
pack
a
few
of
these
away
on
a
warm
day
a
great
alternative
to
the
more
established
light
beers
in
this
country
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
has
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
hops
taste
is
big
on
hops
not
much
else
definatly
lacking
malts
and
the
refreshing
nature
of
most
pilseners
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
below
average
drinkability
overall
i
found
this
to
be
a
mediocre
effort
a
nice
german
pilsner
poured
with
a
yellow
body
with
a
creamy
soft
looking
head
of
a
fingers
breadth
smelt
nice
and
bready
with
sweet
grain
flavors
layered
well
behind
a
nice
dry
hop
character
very
easy
drinking
this
is
nice
to
settle
on
just
under
5
alcohol
golden
yellow
big
fat
carbonation
bubbles
white
head
did
not
retain
for
long
probably
not
the
best
glassware
spicy
floral
hop
aroma
saaz
tastes
great
more
of
a
herbal
hop
chalky
bitter
finish
however
starts
with
a
bready
malt
backbone
doesnt
linger
too
long
and
is
very
refreshing
yum
d
does
not
get
more
drinkable
than
this
nice
and
refreshing
could
probably
knock
6
back
this
beer
pours
crystal
clear
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aromas
that
come
off
of
this
beer
are
clean
and
crisp
with
lemon
and
subtle
earthy
hops
the
flavor
continues
the
lemon
aroma
and
follows
with
a
clean
smooth
noble
hop
bitterness
in
the
back
i
can
taste
a
bit
of
honey
and
bread
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
while
remaining
light
and
refreshing
this
beer
is
not
a
summer
seasonal
but
available
year
round
i
can
drink
this
one
on
the
hottest
day
of
the
summer
and
the
snowiest
winter
night
appearance
is
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
sits
atop
for
a
little
while
its
smell
contains
bread
malt
sugar
a
basic
pils
profile
taking
a
sip
i
taste
more
malt
some
hops
some
sweetness
with
a
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
the
pilsener
style
with
just
the
right
carbonation
level
the
drinkability
is
also
good
this
is
a
great
beer
to
session
i
have
seen
pikeland
pils
on
the
shelf
for
a
while
and
am
glad
that
i
finally
got
around
to
trying
it
recommended
smells
pretty
good
fairly
crisp
and
lightly
sweet
the
floral
and
noble
hops
arentt
overpowering
but
arent
shy
either
nice
punch
of
bitterness
with
leafy
and
tangy
hop
flavors
that
linger
a
surprisingly
thickish
feel
is
enhanced
by
moderate
carbonation
light
grainy
and
grassy
notes
could
be
a
touch
crisper
and
spicier
but
a
very
tasty
pils
that
gets
an
easy
recommendation
from
me
the
flavor
has
a
wondefully
spicy
and
lots
of
fresh
hop
alongside
a
slight
dry
mineral
yeast
element
the
flavor
is
good
and
zesty
w
spice
and
mild
tinge
of
crackerlike
pilsner
malt
w
slight
tinge
of
grassiness
as
it
finishes
this
is
a
quality
pilsner
i
could
see
having
this
with
a
plain
cheese
pizza
or
a
nice
meat
pie
i
enjoyed
this
a
lot
and
respect
the
brewers
of
slyfox
for
making
such
a
quality
lager
a
little
more
bitter
than
it
needs
to
be
but
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
i
like
the
dry
refreshing
flavor
profile
it
provides
d
highly
drinkable
beer
nothing
outrageous
or
distracting
and
very
satisfying
pours
a
very
attractive
bright
yellow
sunflower
color
with
a
very
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
head
retention
is
great
and
when
you
take
a
sip
it
leaves
phenomenal
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
acidic
almost
like
lemons
and
tangerines
and
their
rinds
the
flavor
has
a
distinct
acidic
bitter
citrus
rind
component
that
makes
it
a
little
over
the
top
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
clean
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
also
very
nice
easy
to
drink
and
has
a
very
nice
and
low
abv
to
make
this
sessionable
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
sweet
maltiness
and
a
small
hop
presence
in
the
taste
a
clean
sweet
malt
and
a
nice
bavarian
hop
a
small
bite
and
a
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
bavarian
hop
aftertaste
refreshing
and
clean
somewhat
like
a
standard
pils
d
i
really
want
to
like
pilseners
i
like
what
they
represent
the
og
of
beers
light
crisp
refreshing
easy
to
drink
with
delicate
flavor
profiles
that
seem
to
be
really
appreciated
by
the
refined
beer
palate
i
guess
i
am
just
not
there
yet
pilseners
always
seem
a
little
tinnymetallic
to
me
guess
i
will
have
to
keep
at
it
not
a
bad
beer
great
for
the
hot
weather
and
love
the
can
man
translucent
golden
with
white
bubbly
head
aroma
of
hops
citrus
notes
yeast
flavors
of
light
hops
buttery
bitter
finish
and
grassy
dryness
light
carbonation
goes
well
with
the
light
hop
flavors
and
allows
the
dryness
to
really
set
in
on
the
palate
a
sly
move
putting
this
pilsener
in
a
can
tricky
tricky
d
not
a
bad
pils
had
no
problems
putting
down
two
pints
of
this
refreshing
and
a
good
start
to
the
night
would
consider
this
as
a
summer
session
beer
good
stuff
light
refreshing
but
pretty
flavorful
for
its
size
great
outdoor
warm
weather
beer
another
great
pa
pils
this
is
a
great
easygoing
beer
full
of
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
another
excellent
beer
from
the
beautiful
state
of
pennsylvania
this
is
certainly
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
like
it
a
lot
were
this
local
to
me
it
would
sate
my
periodic
craving
for
pilsner
with
ease
im
glad
i
picked
up
a
six
pack
instead
of
a
single
definitely
worth
a
shot
d
this
is
really
an
enjoyable
pilsener
i
like
the
nice
dose
of
hops
they
give
it
do
what
can
i
say
im
a
sucker
for
a
good
pils
its
not
my
favorite
pa
pilsstoudts
but
its
up
there
its
well
worth
a
taste
if
youre
a
fan
of
american
made
pilseners
as
the
days
get
longer
and
the
temperature
rises
i
see
many
more
sixers
of
this
disappearing
from
my
fridge
prost
i
cant
find
really
anything
wrong
with
this
pils
amazing
how
this
beer
is
only
rated
a
b
on
here
another
score
from
the
pa
breweries
for
making
anohther
great
german
pils
d
very
drinkable
not
overpowering
and
very
light
would
probably
be
a
good
gateway
beer
for
a
craft

thats
for
sure
a
nice
mineral
water
and
biscuit

sweetness
balancing
out
the
hops
flavor
is
a
bitter
semi
sweet
mix
of

is
pretty
poundable
one
of
the
great
summer
brews
in
cans
that
i
will
be
bringing
with
me
to
the
games
easily
one
of
the
better
brews
in
cans
overall
and
it
has
medals
to
proves
its
viability
as
a
pils
poured
from
a
can
with
a
best
buy
51610

poured
into

imperial
pint
glass
with
about
2
inches
of

of
carbonation
bright
yellow
color
scents
of
grass
and
sweet

very
flavor
forward
crisp
almost
lemon
like
flavors
lots
of
hops
but
not
overwhelming
very
balanced
flavor
and
easy
to
drink
not
watery
not
boozy
a
great
spring
and
summer
beer
paired
nicely
with
some
hot
wings
and
nachos
i
poured
from
a
12
ounce
can
into
my
sa
perfect
pint
glass
it
is
pale
clear
and
straw
in
color
the
2
finger
head
recedes
as
fast
as
it
forms
the
aroma
is
grassy
spicy
the
flavor
follows
the
nose
the
finish
is
dry
and
leaves
a
spicylemony
bitterness
it
is
light
in
body
and
well
carbonated
a
good
pilsner
crisp
and
clean
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
and
i
could
easily
have
another
without
hesitation
as
i
have
in
the
past
ill
continue
to
include
this
beer
in
its
rotation
along
with
some
of
the
other
favorite
pils
style
beers
so
there
is
no
question
ill
be
having
this
beer
again
got
a
can
from
a
buddy
up
north
poured
it
into
a
pint
glass
got
a
nice
little
foam
that
turned
into
thin
fingers
in
a
minute
over
a
straw
colored
body
smells
a
little
malty
a
little
hoppy
and
like
it
has
a
complex
sweetness
behind
it
i
really
like
the
smell
tastes
less
sweet
than
it
smells
with
a
reasonable
but
changing
hoppiness
and
a
crisp
finish
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
having
a
few
more
md
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
about
perfect
for
style
if
people
could
buy
a
case
of
a
beer
like
this
for
1720
i
think
that
the
bmcs
would
see
a
major
sales
hit
d
great
its
clean
without
any
off
flavors
sessionable
and
dry
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
another
sip
perfectly
enjoyable
in
the
dead
of
winter
my
first
beer
from
sly
fox
cant
wait
to
try
more
this
is
not
what
i
really
consider
a
pilsner
but
its
good
it
was
poured
at
around
4648
degrees
it
may
need
to
be
chilled
a
bit
more
lots
of
character
dvery
good
representation
of
the
style
very
drinkable
i
would
drink
this
beer
again
drinkability
an
absolute
perfect
session
beer
the
taste
is
spot
on
for
a
pils
and
offers
a
nice
mix
of
simple
flavors
that
are
absolutely
perfect
when
relaxing
on
a
cold
winters
night
simply
put
a
quality
beer
that
i
would
recommend
to
anybody
pours
a
nice
light
and
bright
golden
yellow
color
with
full
merangue
like
head
and
great
retention
and
lacing
smell
is
of
grass
freshly
dried
grains
and
light
note
of
lemon
taste
follows
scent
with
the
grassy
and
freshly
dried
grains
complimented
well
by
a
lemony
note
which
at
times
seems
to
get
in
the
way
fully
carbonated
light
body
refreshing
would
love
to
revisit
this
beer
and
have
this
replace
the
bmc
light
products
at
future
nonbeer
head
gatherings
it
was
volital
to
pour
getting
a
hugh
head
which
part
of
it
never
disappeared
and
was
stiff
it
laced
really
well
and
had
the
great
german
pilsner
aroma
it
also
had
a
great
old
world
taste
to
it
i
really
enjoyed
this
brew
and
regret
taking
2
years
to
open
it
very
easy
drinking
goes
down
quickly
would
i
buy
more
of
it
its
a
tough
call
i
might
try
a
pint
on
draft
at
the
brewery
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
more
cans
its
not
that
isnt
a
good
beer
its
just
the
style
that
i
dont
go
crazy
over
this
is
the
most
authentic
tasting
north
german
pilsner
brewed
in
america
that
ive
had
quite
nice
goes
down
easy
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
and
flavorful
without
being
too
much
easily
and
highly
sessionable
for
the
summer
months
ill
be
returning
to
this
i
imagine
flavor
is
very
similar
to
aroma
with
a
silky
creamy
pilsner
malt
body
with
hints
of
grass
and
straw
and
a
crisp
earthy
subtle
hop
presence
that
provides
an
excellent
balance
slightly
dry
finish
a
very
nice
session
beer
that
is
perfect
for
drinking
outside
in
the
warmer
months
appearance
and
smell
were
nothing
too
fancy
this
is
a
pilsner
the
taste
for
a
pilsner
was
very
full
and
robust
you
tasted
the
hop
sharpness
but
also
the
pilsner
malt
was
nice
and
light
to
the
taste
the
carbonation
was
nice
and
high
not
too
high
for
this
light
beverage
i
really
which
i
had
a
case
of
this
stuff
dr
very
much
so
easy
crisp
and
light
but
full
of
flavor
d
one
of
the
top
for
sure
the
cans
are
a
nice
touch
as
well
goes
down
like
water
which
is
a
bit
dangerous
when
youre
nursing
3
days
sobriety
and
have
suffered
through
a
whole
bunch
of
hot
bike
rides
as
i
have
this
was
gone
almost
as
soon
as
i
opened
it
poured
into
an
american
pint
glass
from
the
can
looks
great
in
the
glass
light
wispy
head
that
quickly
dies
light
golden
in
color
light
carbonation
the
nose
reveals
german
hops
light
and
grassy
slightly
bready
and
co2
the
taste
is
decent
but
a
little
heavy
in
the
metallic
hops
and
a
little
light
in
the
malt
dept
after
a
few
sips
the
hops
prevail
as
the
dominating
taste
leaving
little
room
for
much
of
anything
else
mouthfeel
is
very
dry
a
little
too
dry
for
my
taste
drinkability
is
decent
sessionable
abv
helps
this
score
a
bit
taste
is
fairly
bitter
and
some
light
lemon
very
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
this
humid
mid
80
degrees
day
out
on
the
patio
not
overly
complex
but
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
just
what
i
was
looking
for
this
evening
good
beer
highly
drinkable
pils
this
is
a
fabulous
beer
out
of
a
can
perfect
for
a
hot
summer
day
at
the
beach
on
the
river
or
by
the
pool
a
definite
drinker
where
glass
may
not
be
allowed
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
a
supremely
easy
drinker
a
pilsener
with
some
character
hard
to
beat
that
i
smell
laundry
detergent
like
fabric
softener
an
average
brew
would
work
with
a
kielbasa
on
a
roll
nothing
to
go
try
and
find
to
much
distraction
from
few
good
qualities
makes
this
one
nothing
special
a
solid
brew
from
sly
fox
worth
checking
out
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
easy
drinking
beer
being
from
a
can
took
nothing
away
from
it
definitely
a
brew
that
you
can
have
more
than
one
the
nose
has
a
stink
to
it
i
find
delicious
along
with
sweet
corn
pils
malt
lemon
grass
and
earthy
grain
the
flavor
is
pretty
much
spot
on
the
same
with
a
grassy
finish
and
pils
dryness
one
exception
is
how
surprisingly
sweet
it
is
this
is
not
an
issue
however
as
the
prickly
carbonation
and
light
to
medium
body
keep
it
very
refreshing

d
i
have
found
my
new
favorite
session
beerand
its
in
a
can
too
bad
i
cannot
get
it
here
in
ga
a
very
nice
example
of
the
style
and
another
fine
canned
beer
from
sly
fox
this
pilsener
goes
down
quite
easy
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
cheapest
crafts
i
can
get
and
it
is
amazing
d
a
true
session
beer
clocking
in
at
just
under
5
i
would
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
while
i
drink
this
in
the
dead
of
winter
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
at
some
point
a
great
session
brew
by
sly
fox
nothing
more
nothing
less
overall
a
very
tasty
pils
good
american
adaptation
not
bad
not
real
good
strictly
average
thats
all
i
have
when
i
gave
on
of
these
to
a
friend
he
said
its
a
better
version
of
budweiser
i
can
agree
that
its
better
than
bud
it
has
a
great
drinkability
but
does
so
while
having
actual
flavor
although
a
subtle
one
but
when
you
are
looking
for
a
brew
to
kick
back
with
and
consume
a
few
at
a
time
you
dont
want
something
with
an
overwhelming
flavor
overall
a
big
thanks
to
drjay
for
this
beer
i
liked
it
for
what
it
was
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
the
beer
was
pretty
good
the
closest
thing
along
with
victory
prima
pils
to
the
real
german
pilsners
nothing
can
really
match
the
originals
or
the
freshness
when
had
on
tap
in
germany
but
the
pikeland
pils
is
really
good

d
i
really
dont
like
pilsners
they
just
dont
do
it
for
me
other
than
two
other
exceptions
this
can
is
almost
six
months
past
its
best
by
date
so
i
can
only
imagine
what
this
is
like
fresh
with
that
being
said
do
cans
help
keep
beer
fresher
longer
i
already
pimp
cans
so
im
a
little
biased
but
i
think
so
this
is
an
excellent
beer
that
i
wish
was
sold
in
texas
if
it
was
maybe
i
would
be
able
to
say
i
like
pilsners
either
way
this
is
a
must
try
beer
from
a
can
not
because
of
the
novelty
of
the
can
but
because
its
a
very
good
beer
this
guy
goes
down
way
too
easy
i
have
neglected
this
beer
for
way
too
long
my
new
go
to
pilsner
md
medium
bodied
and
very
carbonated
which
is
what
i
expect
out
of
a
good
pils
incredibly
easy
drinking
dvery
high
it
just
goes
down
so
smooth
and
with
the
low
abv
you
can
drink
it
all
night
it
also
gets
points
for
being
in
a
can
i
fist
picked
this
up
to
take
to
a
concert
and
i
was
not
disappointed
taste
is
very
nice
compared
to
the
smell
a
nice
spicy
hop
note
with
a
typical
pilsner
malt
profile
crisp
and
quenching
and
a
great
session
beer
for
someone
who
isnt
huge
on
the
style
i
would
drink
this
beer
it
wouldnt
be
on
my
top
ten
but
if
it
was
this
or
some
domestic
swill
i
would
take
this
in
a
heartbeat
d
a
bit
off
from
metallic
notes
but
refreshing
and
pleasant
otherwise
d
awesome
pilsner
lots
of
flavor
great
moutfeel
looks
fantastic
many
thanks
scott
this
is
something
id
have
all
the

your
tastebuds

on
you

places

clean

fresh
drinkability

just
fine

warms
a

i
nice
session
beer
very
appropriate
for
the
summer
overall
an
excellent
pils
that
is
only
beaten
out
by
the
prima
this
is
my
second
favorite
pils
and
i
would
gladly
drink
it
anytime
great
work
sly
fox
this
pours
out
a
delicious
looking
transparent
straw
yellow
color
with
plenty
of
head
and
lacing
theres
a
slight
bit
of
haze
in
the
glass
and
its
slowly
cycloneing
downward
to
the
bottom
very
pretty
this
has
a
very
clean
and
crisp
smell
to
it
a
medium
amount
of
citrus
hops
shine
through
taste
is
very
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
a
much
more
skunky
bitter
taste
to
it
great
attack
this
pilsner
is
very
light
on
the
tongue
if
i
can
get
sly
fox
up
here
i
would
definitely
drink
more
of
it
a
solid
pils
for
sure
this
packs
a
good
taste
and
excellent
drinkibility
into
one
fresh
tasting
can
of
beer
great
for
summer
drinking
folks
dcertianly
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
phoenix
pale
ale
much
more
but
this
brew
is
well
done
and
true
to
style
it
didnt
win
a
gabf
gold
medal
for
nothing
it
is
infinitely
drinkable
and
would
be
easy
to
throw
back
can
after
can
a
great
beer
to
take
a
sixer
along
to
a
summer
gathering
when
you
dont
want
to
lower
your
standards
to
the
guest
bmc
offerings
when
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
this
sly
fox
brew
is
a
clear
bright
and
shiny
lemon
yellow
color
with
a
decent
12
inch
creamy
head
of
white
foam
it
had
great
retention
that
left
behind
a
small
white
film
and
loads
of
white
streaks
of
lace
around
the
glass
the
aroma
was
very
dry
and
spicy
with
some
spicy
german
hops
and
a
splash
of
malts
there
was
nothing
more
in
the
aroma
than
just
the
malts
and
hops
it
was
just
your
basic
pilsner
aroma
this
pilsner
is
dry
with
dried
floral
hops
and
just
a
touch
of
malt
it
was
like
the
aroma
but
what
it
lacked
in
flavors
the
spicy
bitter
hops
taste
made
up
the
difference
the
mouthfeel
was
light
with
a
refreshing
bitter
aftertaste
of
dried
floral
hops
in
the
end
a
nice
refreshing
bitter
canned
beer
that
would
make
a
great
choice
for
a
summer
session
beer
pikeland
pils
is
a
boldly
bitter
beer
at
first
i
thought
it
might
be
better
with
a
little
less
bite
but
as
a
finished
the
glass
i
craved
another
a
very
good
session
beer
great
to
drink
cheers
overalllacking
that
punch
or
extra
characters
that
makes
it
measure
up
in
this
land
of
prima
sunshine
and
peregrine
pils
still
an
ok
version
of
the
style
but
i
was
hoping
for
more
also
a
pilsner
glass
would
be
good
next
time
drinkability
excellent
a
great
take
on
this
style
if
you
like
this
style
then
try
this
one
it
has
a
good
deal
of
flavor
and
is
a
well
craftedpilsner
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
d
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
good
for
the
style
worth
trying
one
of
the
best
beers
ive
had
out
of
a
can
pours
a
clear
straw
yellow
color
with
at
least
1
inch
of
foamy
white
head
which
has
great
retention
and
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
especially
at
the
top
smells
are
plentiful
and
strong
with
lemon
spicy
and
citrus
hops
and
light
malt
and
bread
taste
is
very
biscuity
up
front
with
some
honey
and
lemon
butter
with
a
dried
grass
hop
finish
mediumlight
in
body
with
good
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
a
fairly
good
pils
that
would
go
great
while
out
fishing
or
doing
some
other
activity
where
cans
would
be
more
convenient
than
bottles
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
the
taste
description
above
may
seem
spartan
but
the
flavor
subtleties
are
innumerable
and
difficult
to
describe
definitely
recommended
pours
out
a
straw
yellow
under
a
light
but
thick
and
frothy
white
head
decent
head
retention
and
spotty

clean
and
pleasant

hefty

full

presence
followed
by
a
crisp

somewhat
dry
herbal

hoppy

finish
is
long
refreshing
and
dry
shows
off
a
very
nice
balance
between
the
sweet
malts
and
herballike
hops
quite
easy
goin
down
and
enjoying
a
few
of
these
would
be
no
problem
overall
a
pretty
good
pilsener
certainly
drinkable
and
pleasant
smellingtasting
but
nothing
made
me
say
wow
that
was
good
d
not
much
here
if
you
like
this
then
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
but
i
personally
wont
be
having
another
d
could
spend
the
better
part
of
an
afternoon
or
evening
with
a
few
rounds
of
this
brew
i
am
really
starting
to
like
the
designs
on
the
sly
fox
cans
this
one
has
a
large
hop
cone
on
the
front
enough
talk
about
the
container
on
to
the
beer
this
one
was
bright
yellow
and
transparent
the
head
was
stark
white
rocky
and
huge
the
smell
was
earthy
and
slightly
like
baked
bread
yeast
anyone
the
flavor
is
subtle
and
crisp
the
only
flavor
i
can
pick
out
is
yeast
the
aftertaste
lingers
but
is
actually
not
bad
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
hot
days
it
makes
me
think
of
baseball
games
notes
in
my
notes
i
wrote
the
word
bite
three
times
the
combination
from
the
spicey
and
bitter
hops
along
with
the
spritzy
feel
made
it
feel
like
it
was
biting
a
bit
if
you
know
what
i
mean
thats
not
intended
to
be
a
negative
comment
just
a
descriptive
one
my
first
experience
with
pikeland
pils
was
on
a
canoe
trip
down
the
delaware
river
this
past
weekend
and
i
was
real
glad
to
have
it
instead
of
the
usual
canned
schwag
youre
stuck
with
in
such
circumstances
thanks
to
sly
fox
and
the
other
craft
brewers
whove
begun
putting
good
beers
in
cans
giving
us
more
beer

options

of
hogtownharry
poured
a
hazy
deep
yellow
color
pils
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
dry
malt
with
some
crisp
german
hops
taste
is
also
dominated
by
some
dry
malt
and
a
dry
crisp
hoppy
finish
body
is
above
average
with
some
low
filtration
and
lees
at
the
bottom
while
this
is
a
good
pils
i
thought
it
miss
some
of
the
floral
aspect
that
i
usually
like
in
the
style
poured
a
light
pale
yellow
with
a
huge
fizzy
white
head
i
had
to
actually
wait
to
pour
the
rest
in
the
glass
cans
give
awesome
head
retention
i
must
say
the
head
had
a
nice
slow
fade
and
left
behind
lots
of
lace
this
color
was
very
very
bright
and
had
lots
of
sediment
in
the
bottom
smell
was
very
light
and
crisp
smelled
very
lively
nice
light
lemon
and
grass
flavors
with
a
hint
of
yeast
and
grain
the
taste
was
just
great
smooth
big
carbonation
made
it
very
refreshing
very
very
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
with
a
nice
pine
resin
flavor
and
hints
of
grapefruit
and
pineapple
and
lemon
big
dry
finish
that
was
nice
and
bitter
this
was
awesome
and
really
awoke
a
rekindling
of
the
pilsner
i
normally
find
them
a
bit
bland
but
this
has
renewed
my
intrest
and
i
look
forward
to
trying
some
again
in
the
warmer
months
to
come
clean
and
refreshing
and
perfect
to
set
in
the
bottom
of
a
boat
to
keep
cool
while
fishing
on
a
warm
lazy
summer
afternoon
while
there
are
better
pils
to
be
had
from
pa
breweries
namely
sunshine
and
prima
this
is
still
a
very
solid
choice
its
very
drinkable
right
from
the
can
which
is
quite
a
nice
change
of
pace
i
have
had
no
problems
drinking
a
few
cans
with
a
meal
pizza
wings
or
while
just
hanging
out
drinkability
a
decent
american
pils
that
is
right
up
there
with
victorys
truly
its
beers
like
this
that
justify
my
condemnation
of
the
big
boys
what
they
turn
out
is
consistent
perhaps
but
its
also
crap
now
this
is
an
american
pilsner
that
tastes
good
doesnt
turn
my
stomach
i
could
drink
several
of
and
its
craftbrewed
and
comes
in
a
can
cant
say
that
about
mgd
or
its
ilk
i
havent
had
too
many
pilseners
quite
like
this
one
its
alot
more
flavorful
than
most
with
a
great
deal
more
hoppiness
than
aniticipated
the
drinkablility
is
amazing
its
truly
one
of
only
a
few
beers
i
could
see
myself
getting
an
entire
case
of

wish
i
had
more
hard
to
find
a
six
pack
this
far
west
very
flavorful
beer
you
could
cut
it
5050
with
water
and
it
would
still
have
more
taste
than
most
pilsners
beyond
the
taste
this
may
be
one
of
the
best
looking
beers
ive
ever
seen
even
though
it
comes
in
a
can
and
lots
of
american
pils
drinkers
will
glug
it
straight
from
the
aluminum
this
beer
just
begs
to
be
poured
into
a
long
tall
pilsner
glass
straw
colored
body
with
a
slight
haze
poured
out
of
the
can
topped
off
by
a
huge
foamy
head
a
grassy
aroma
with
a
bit
of
floral
smell
and
some
lemon
so
far
this
appears
to
be
a
hefeweizen
a
dry
finish
with
a
light
hop
presence
light
and
crisp
and
very
drinkable
i
am
impressed
that
it
is
from
a
can
i
am
usually
against
beverages
in
a
can
due
to
the
taste
this
is
an
exception
a
fine
offering
d
bitterness
wasnt
overpowering
this
led
to
a
very
drinkable
selection
from
sly
fox
i
had
this
10
times
out
of
the
can
before
pouring
it
into
a
glass
to
review
it
it
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
fast
dissolving
fluffy
white
head
the
smell
was
dominated
by
woody
earthy
hops
and
there
wasnt
much
else
the
taste
was
nicely
bitter
and
woody
the
beer
started
and
ended
bitter
not
much
malt
getting
through
it
has
a
thin
body
with
nice
carbonation
it
is
not
as
refreshing
as
other
pils
but
it
was
a
great
vacation
beer
for
drinking
on
the
beach
or
by
the
pool
cheers
notes
not
my
favorite
style
nor
do
i
have
the
most
experience
with
it
but
this
is
spot
on
as
far
as
what
a
pils
should
be
in
my
opinion
hats
off
again
to
sly
fox
for
these
craft
beer
in
cans
creations
i
dont
know
what
this
beer
looks
like
i
simply
drank
it
straight
from
the
can
it
has
a
very
big
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
to
it
im
surprised
this
isnt
an
ipa
with
the
amount
of
bitterness
in
it
definitely
could
taste
the
citrusy
and
pinelike
flavors
in
the
beer
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
upfront
flavor
which
is
nice
adds
to
the
complexity
but
finishes
really
dry
drinking
it
from
the
can
it
actually
left
a
metalic
flavor
in
my
mouth
weird
but
this
is
a
good
beer
i
cant
wait
to
try
the
rest
of
their
beers
this
is
my
2006
summer
session
beer
and
im
thrilled
that
it
isnt
a
seasonal
offering
my
only
concern
is
the
cost
since
i
dont
understand
the
nuances
of
pilsner
the
price
seemed
high
for
a
lighetr
style
of
beer
12
ounce
can
thanks
beerbeing
note
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
me
craft
beer
in
a
can
this
is
a
pilsner
from
a
can
that
will
not
jerk
you
around
whod
have
thought
that
great
beer
can
come
out
of
a
can
well
it
certainly
does
now
btw
that
swig
i
got
from
the
can
was
delicious
quality
pa
pils
in
a
can
can
you
say
beach
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
massive
white
puffy
head
smell
is
hoppy
flowery
and
quite
enjoyable
taste
is
strong
and
malty
with
a
nice
crispness
nice
hop
bitterness
to
balance
the
maltiness
finish
is
nicely
bitter
with
a
good
dry
ending
a
very
nice
easy
drinking
flavorful
beer
taste
is
floral
and
citrusy
there
is
some
malt
presence
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
also
in
the
can
i
have
been
getting
and
odd
aftertaste
i
mean
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
and
it
could
stand
for
a
good
gateway
beer
for
the
budmiller
crowd
it
definately
has
something
lacking
good
but
nowhere
near
some
of
their
other
stuff
craft
beer
in
a
can
yes
it
works
and
well
the
crisp
refreshing
nature
brings
thirst
to
a
screeching
halt
but
the
experience
demands
more
and
more
no
matter
how
slaked
that
thirst
may
be
its
about
as
stridently
crisp
and
clean
as
i
can
remember
having
almost
a
hoppy
knifes
edge
delivering
satisfaction
but
leaving
a
desire
for
more
the
sole
misstep
in
the
aroma
wasnt
ignorable
but
i
can
easily
look
past
it
in
saying
that
this
beer
is
about
as
drinkable
as
id
want
one
to
be
maybe
its
not
for
everyone
as
pugnacious
as
it
is
but
thats
okay
because
it
just
means
more
for
me
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
full
coat
of
head
over
top
that
is
maintained
by
a
big
cascade
of
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
clarity
is
fantastic
on
this
one
solid
looking
brew
nose
is
dominated
by
a
very
nice
herbal
and
floral
halertau
hop
with
a
lighter
crisp
and
lightly
sweet
pilsner
malt
behind
it
it
seems
a
touch
light
and
id
like
a
bit
more
of
what
is
already
there
the
flavor
is
really
working
for
me
initially
it
delivers
a
very
solid
floral
hop
with
just
a
hint
of
very
lightly
grainy
pilsner
malt
sweetness
behind
it
moving
to
a
more
herbal
blast
from
the
hop
intertwined
with
a
very
clean
and
enticing
bitterness
it
is
slightly
skewed
towards
the
hop
but
i
really
enjoy
the
hop
character
that
this
one
presents
it
makes
me
want
to
brew
a
nice
old
world
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
light
to
moderate
with
a
solid
moderate
carbonation
i
would
definately
keep
this
one
around
if
it
were
available
around
here
this
one
would
be
awesome
to
break
out
at
the
campfire
in
the
summer
or
carry
in
my
backpack
when
out
chasing
insects
in
the
field
this
one
is
a
true
winner
light
gold
color
with
a
white
head
smell
of
grassy
hops
with
the
slightest
citrus
taste
is
smooth
and
malty
with
a
grassy
slightly
spicey
hops
note
i
believe
its
mostly
saaz
hops
coming
through
very
dry
i
would
have
put
this
more
in
a
czech
pilsener
style
light
body
and
very
drinkable
i
had
one
of
these
last
night
and
it
struck
me
as
a
little
bit
harsh
tonight
it
is
tasting
very
good
this
would
be
a
great
pool
party
or
boating
on
the
river
kind
of
beer
a
second
fine
canned
offering
from
sly
fox
this
is
a
really
solid
pils
a
style
i
am
starting
to
warm
up
to
the
pour
on
this
was
a
slightly
clouded
golden
yellow
with
a
one
fingered
head
that
only
stuck
around
for
a
sip
or
two
the
smell
showed
a
nice
hop
backbone
with
citrus
and
herbalgrassy
scents
lingering
the
taste
was
clean
and
crisp
with
a
nice
balanced
flavor
that
made
you
realize
that
not
all
pils
are
created
equal
this
one
clearly
is
a
cut
above
with
a
slightly
hoppy
profile
that
doesnt
overwhelm
nicely
complimenting
the
crisp
body
of
this
beer
crystal
clear
yellowgold
with
a
rocky
white
head
decent
retention
and
spotty
lacing
clean
grain
aroma
with
plenty
of
floral
hops
and
light
citrus
character
these
qualities
carry
into
the
flavour
but
are
balanced
by
a
solid
bitterness
and
hint
of
earthiness
in
the
hops
light
body
with
generous
crisp
carbonation
well
attenuated
this
is
a
really
good
lager
with
plenty
of
hop
character
nicely
done
all
the
flavors
are
subtlesweet
biscuits
bread
hops
with
a
tinge
of
citrus
this
is
a
very
traditional
interpretation
of
a
pilsner
executed
with
skill
and
precision
a
minor
nitpick
is
that
the
taste
as
foreshadowed
by
the
smell
has
a
dry
grassy
overtone
that
takes
the
beer
down
a
notch
a
small
notch
im
not
crazy
about
pilsner
urquell
at
least
the
version
available
in
the
states
but
people
say
its
much
better
in
europe
where
its
fresh
sly
fox
pikeland
pils
tastes
the
way
i
imagine
that
a
fresh
pils
urquell
tastes
good
beer
in
a
can
what
will
they
think
of
next
the
pikeland
pils
poured
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
stayed
around
while
i
drank
it
the
aroma
was
nice
and
citrusy
with
a
bit
of
malt
the
taste
is
lemony
maybe
some
grapefruit
refreshing
this
is
a
smooth
and
drinkable
pils
and
another
good
selection
from
sly
fox
dont
skip
out
on
this
one
just
because
its
a
pilsner
its
a
winner
and
it
wont
disappoint
the
mouth
feel
was
light
and
slightly
sticky
with
a
small
tingly
carbonation
clear
bright
golden
hue
is
quickly
the
foundation
to
a
siperb
foamy
white
head
that
lasts
forever
fair
toasted
and
bready
malts
serve
as
a
base
to
the
wondrous
floral
hops
that
characterize
this
beer
leafy
lemony
herbal
vibrant
hoppiness
that
emerge
from
the
glass
and
brings
you
straight
to
germany
through
a
very
dry
portal
citric
in
mouth
but
in
the
course
of
a
mineral
and
very
crisp
interplay
which
makes
it
all
work
nicely
ahhh
those
flowery
saaz
lightmedium
bodied
extremely
engaging
carbonation
remarkable
pilsner
drinkable
very
much
so
this
is
a
beer
you
want
more
and
more
of
an
incredible
pilsener
to
say
the
least
this
fine
fine
example
of
this
style
presented
itself
before
my
eyes
with
a
light
whiteassnow
bubbly
head
which
quickly
faded
to
a
light
lace
along
the
side
of
the
glass
one
smell
of
this
gem
of
a
pilsener
filled
my
mind
with
thought
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
herbal
maltiness
an
incredible
tasting
brew
the
crispness
on
the
palate
was
just
one
of
this
brews
redeeming
factors
i
almost
felt
as
if
i
could
taste
and
or
experience
each
and
every
ingredient
put
into
this
work
of
art
while
somewhat
dry
on
its
finish
with
a
hint
of
bitter
bite
this
is
still
the
classic
germanstyle
pils
i
always
love
to
try
again
and
again
bright
somewhat
cloudy
golden
witha
nice
cap
of
the
white
stuff
the
aroma
is
very
fruity
and
filled
with
boatloads
of
hops
saaz
and
a
blend
of
a
few
others
there
is
also
a
nice
lemon
tang
in
the
aroma
as
well
the
tastre
is
all
saaz
and
lemon
up
front
slightly
fruity
and
biscuitlike
in
the
middle
and
hoppy
and
slightly
dry
and
spritzy
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
spritzy
refreshing
and
alive
and
the
drinkability
is
very
very
very
good
a
killer
keller
taste
was
light
and
slightly
bitter
towards
then
end
i
definitely
got
the
sensation
of
grapefruit
juice
and
other
citrus
when
i
was
tasting
this
beer
this
pils
had
a
nice
mouthfeel
but
i
thought
it
had
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
in
the
end
i
felt
a
little
disappointed
with
this
beer
because
i
was
expecting
something
tasting
more
like
pilsner
urquell
but
despite
this
i
finished
off
the
growler
anyway
on
tap
at
the
drafting
room
poured
out
clear
and
light
golden
with
white
head
of
tiny
bubbles
that
left
a
thin
covering
and
light
ring
the
scent
was
mainly
vineous
tastes
very
dry
making
it
very
drinkable
bitter
and
yummy
piney
leaves
taste
of
hops
on
your
tongue
good
brew
beer
is
good
happy
beering
the
color
is
more
bronze
in
nature
to
me
carbonation
is
wonderful
very
small
bubbles
whic
support
a
nice
white
head
nice
lace
as
one
drinks
it
down
the
nose
to
me
is
somewhere
between
being
spice
and
fruit
it
is
very
subtle
and
the
hop
character
is
detected
in
the
nose
very
crisp
clean
finish
i
could
drink
it
all
day
i
picked
up
a
sixtel
of
this
and
the
cascade
ipa
because
ive
been
so
impressed
by
sly
fox
brews
thus
far
im
even
more
so
now
this
pours
a
cloudy
light
blonde
color
which
is
very
hazy
and
has
a
sticky
cloudwhite
head
with
nice
lacing
all
down
the
glass
the
smell
is
lemons
lime
grass
straw
flowery
hops
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
was
surprisingly
raw
to
me
this
is
only
my
second
keller
pils
you
can
taste
a
lemony
tartness
which
really
gives
this
pils
a
nice
kick
the
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
dry
with
a
hard
bite
that
is
really
really
bitter
in
a
good
way
something
completely
different
from
you
standard
pils
but
i
could
imagine
a
filtered
version
of
this
as
well
im
not
sure
what
the
abv
is
on
this
one
5
or
so
but
the
drinkability
level
is
very
high
think
lemonade
on
a
hot
summer
day
wheat
beer
like
refreshing
quality
and
all
natural
ingredients
and
style
cloudy
hazy
light
peach
color
in
the
glass
some
small
bubbles
of
carbonation
and
a
slight
white
head
not
much
nose
just
a
slight
malt
sweetness
in
the
nose
sweet
malt
taste
with
an
astringent
hop
finish
quite
clean
tasting
lively
carbonation
swirls
around
the
tongue
creates
a
lively
mouth
sweet
malt
coating
finish
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
have
had
to
date
the
balance
of
flavors
is
impeccable
has
a
spicierthanmostpilsners
hop
character
which
hits
you
right
at
the
start
leading
to
a
delicious
piney
malty
middle
finishes
dry
and
rather
bitter
with
the
hops
still
making
themselves
known
a
great
pils
i
had
tried
the
keller
style
once
before
and
enjoyed
it
so
i
figured
i
would
give
it
a
trypoured
a
nice
unfiltered
deep
golden
color
with
nice
big
rocky
head
very
buttery
taste
with
a
good
malt
backgroundnot
a
wimpy
beer
by
any
meansvery
easy
to
drink
a
nice
hand
crafted
brew
you
dont
see
very
oftenwell
done
this
beer
was
part
of
a
sampler
at
the
brewery
poured
a
clear
golden
pale
yellow
color
very
crisp
and
as
for
a
pilsner
the
taste
is
dead
on
everything
that
i
enjoy
in
a
pils
is
here

nice
hop
bite
clear
bright
golden
and
effervescent
very
dry
with
a
nice
clean
aftertaste
a
very
drinkable
and
high
quality
pilsner
beer
i
believe
that
the
pikeland
pils
is
also
served
unfiltered
as
the
keller
pils
and
it
took
a
gold
medal
at
the
gabf
in
2000
its
brewed
in
the
north
german
style
and
utilizes
100
german
pilsener
malt
alongside
a
combination
of
german
and
czech
hops
to
44
ibus
its
clear
golden
body
is
topped
by
a
foamy
brightwhite
head
that
holds
quite
well
and
leaves
some
very
nice
lace
before
settling
to
a
creamy
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
the
nose
displays
a
bouquet
of
boldly
floral
and
spicy
hops
that
are
alive
like
the
aromas
of
a
late
spring
morning
following
a
soft
rain
very
vivid
and
lush
the
body
is
light
and
combines
with
a
finemedian
carbonation
to
give
a
crisp
mouthfeel
the
flavor
displays
an
aggressive
combination
of
solid
maltiness
and
bold
hoppiness
the
bitterness
hits
swift
and
hard
upfront
and
acts
as
a
rock
solid
foundation
for
the
firm
malt
and
richly
floral
spicy
and
mildly
grassy
hops
that
follow
it
finishes
dry
with
a
mild
residual
bitterness
clearly
a
fullthrottle
pils
that
pulls
no
punches
and
satisfies
from
start
to
finish
although
hopheads
will
assuredly
be
impressed
with
this
beer
its
got
enough
balance
finesse
and
floral
hop
character
to
attract
a
variety
of
drinkers
exceptionally
welldone
and
quite
enjoyable
not
a
traditional
pils
by
any
measure
pours
a
quite
cloudy
yellow
with
a
pretty
substantial
white
head
quite
sweet
with
a
nice
dry
crisp
finish
mouthfeel
was
quite
good
with
a
big
body
for
the
style
i
had
a
tough
time
rating
this
one
as
they
clearly
think
that
it
should
be
a
pils
but
there
are
so
many
things
here
that
do
not
fit
the
style
instead
of
penalizing
i
rated
the
beer
based
on
my
enjoyment
of
it
truly
an
interesting
beer
that
should
be
the
first
one
ordered
when
you
visit
while
hoppier
than
the
average
german
pilsner
this
actually
sticks
quite
close
to
the
style
and
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
while
pivo
pils
may
not
be
the
most
exciting
beer
its
not
supposed
to
be
its
just
an
easy
to
drink
beer
that
would
pair
quite
well
with
a
cookout
or
snow
shoveling
its
a
drinkin
beer
o
a
very
nice
pilsner
worth
picking
up
it
you
enjoy
a
good
pils
love
this
one
great
pils
tasty
and
hoppy
but
not
overpowering
nice

taste

its
like
matt
brynildson
picked
my
brain
for
everything
i
like
in
a
good
pilsner
and
amplified
those
qualities
200
the
first
thing
that
hit
me
and
made
me
smile
was
the
color
stout
is
my
preferred
style
of
beer
so
i
naturally
drink
a
lot
of
dark
heavy
fullbodied
ales
this
one
poured
out
a
solid
3
srm
which
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
well
done
guys
firestone
walker
recommends
drinking
this
no
more
than
120
days
from
their
bottled
on
date
and
i
cracked
this
bottle
open
on
day
144
an
oversight
to
be
sure
so
there
wasnt
as
much
carbonation
as
would
be
expected
but
it
still
put
any
of
the
big
3
adjunct
lagers
to
shame
the
nose
was
pleasant
and
subtle
the
hops
were
there
but
not
in
an
in
your
face
simcoe
kind
of
way
my
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
balanced
you
can
taste
the
hops
and
the
malt
but
neither
one
is
over
powering
or
competing
with
the
other
very
light
mouth
feel
as
a
stout
drinker
im
tempted
to
say
it
was
watery
but
i
dont
think
thats
accurate
in
fact
when
i
decided
to
write
this
review
i
had
to
really
focus
on
the
style
of
beer
i
was
drinking
and
make
sure
im
not
judging
it
by
another
styles
standards
for
what
this
beer
was
crafted
to
be
it
delivers
in
my
humble
opinion
it
hits
all
the
benchmarks
of
a
german
pilsner
with
a
twist
the
marketing
seems
to
be
that
this
is
a
hoppy
pilsner
and
while
that
is
accurate
it
is
also
misleading
the
bitterness
is
well
balanced
in
this
beer
the
hops
are
there
but
im
not
sure
i
would
define
this
as
a
hop
forward
or
even
hoppy
beer
its
a
well
balanced
german
pilsner
with
some
interesting
layers
a
very
enjoyable
beer
very
pale
golden
body
with
crystal
clear

foamy

white

sits

brings
the
noble
hops
to
the
forefront
with
lots
of
grassy
and
herbal
flavors
a
dash
of
lemony
citrus
and
some
sweet
toasted
malt
come
through
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
some
creaminess
overall
a
very
nice
hoppy
pilsner
has
that
floralsoapy
hop
thing
i
dont
really
dig
that
dominates
but
still
allows
for
some
pilsner
malt
flavor
to
come
in
good
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
o
while
slightly
hoppier
than
sierra
nevada
nooner
but
not
as
lupulinintense
as
victory
prima
pivo
hits
the
sweet
spot
as
far
as
hopforward
u
s
made
pilsners
go
the
can
format
is
a
plus
in
my
book
as
well
well
done
as
usual
firestone
walker
great
interpretation
of
a
pils
i
would
say
more
bohemian
than
german
a
bastardized
version
of
the
classic
style
for
sure
but
nonetheless
a
personal
favorite
of
my
favorite
style
bottle
of
pivo
pils
drank
othis
beer
is
obviously
not
traditional
or
true
to
a
pils
style
but
it
is
not
a
hopbomb
india
pale
lager
disguised
as
a
pilsner
either
rather
it
is
a
hoppy
pilsner
just
like
the
label
says
im
normally
not
one
to
endorse
style
bending
but
this
beer
is
just
so
damn
good
and
easy
to
drink
i
like
ipas
but
i
would
drink
this
all
day
from
the
can
instead
of
many
of
the
ipas
out
there
as
good
as
any
pilsner
and
better
than
most
the
hop
profile
makes
this
a
fantastic
year
round
beer
that
pairs
well
fish
tacos
pasta
pizza
etc
looks
very
pale
yellow
good
carbonation
has
a
good
bready
nose
some
hop
spice
smooth
clean
malt
flavor
with
a
touch
of
those
hops
feels
light
and
easy
drankin
overall
a
decent
pilsner
phew
this
is
good
pilsy
feel
floral
flavor
am
i
tasting
opiumpoppy
flowers
and
i
can
note
some
honey
in
the
background

pils
right
here
so
great
a
favorite
of
mine
in
the
summer
this
may
be
my
favorite
pilsner
rich
straw
color
with
light
white
foam
some
lacing
smell
is
straw
and
grassy
with
the
slightest
hint
of
banana
taste
is
round
and
slightly
fruity
so
the
clean
crisp
finish
is
a
nice
ending
love
the
hops
throughout
an
especially
nice
pilsner
for
the
winter
months
a
bit
boring
but
tasty
one
of
the
best
pils
i
ever
had
fantastic
beer
great
nose
smooth
and
hoppy
mouth
very
refreshing
with
a
hint
of
grapefruit
overall
nice
balanced
beer
like
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
hard
to
get
super
excited
about
it
but
easy
to
enjoy
the
subtle
complexities
super
easy
drinking
five
words
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
at
half
the
price
of
my
duvel
this
is
a
great
alternative
it
has
an
extremely
clean
hoppy
taste
and
is
very
refreshing
at
only
168
calories
this
beer
is
delicious
and
light
while
still
hoppy
one
of
the
best
pilseners
i
have
had
o
a
lot
to
like
here
and
its
a
pilsner
made
using
obviously
high
quality
ingredients
would
be
very
enjoyable
on
a
late
spring
day
in
the
beer
garden
a
bit
overbalanced
toward
the
bitter
hops
but
still
well
made
i
would
have
it
again
16

az

date
drank
over
30
minutes
pils
yeasts
taste
too
much
and
im
searching
the
hoppy
looks
like
a
poor
european
pils
maybe
a
lack
of
freshness
for
fans
of
czech
pilsner
this
is
a
must
try
the
combination
of
malt
and
hop
without
being
overthetop
is
unbeatable
for
both
satisfaction
and
drinkability
the
delicate
crackerlike
and
slightly
grassy
malt
may
not
seem
that
inspiring
but
when
you
slather
it
in
floral
spicypeppery
and
grassy
hops
and
you
get
that
wethay
and
lemon
characteristic
going
on
as
well
its
actually
fairly
complex
at
the
very
least
its
not
quite
the
same
beer
from
sip
to
sip
and
its
almost
compellingly
drinkable
well
worth
seeking
out
o
yet
another
superb
offering
from
fw
very
much
on
point

the
style
i
could
six
this

and
slightly
crisp
piney
herbal
hops
and
biscuit

fill
the
mouth
finish
is
long
and
bitter
very
nice
pilsener
o
great
pilsener
though
i
would
have
prefer
more
citrus
notes
overall
a
beer
that
is
closer
to
some
of
the
great
south
german
pilsners
i
had
when
studying
abroad
but
still
with
just
a
pinch
too
many
hops
this
one
is
definitely
closer
in
style
to
the
traditional
examples
than
prima
pils
as
this
one
preserves
are
more
assertive
bready
malt
and
slightly
sharper
lager
edge
really
a
fine
beer
and
one
that
perfectly
fit
on
this
indian
summer
day
here
in
eastern
ma
would
buy
again
and
would
highly
recommend
for
craft
lager
lovers
a
nice
well
made
pils
thats
worth
having
again
and
one
that
would
make
a
nice
addition
to
the
rotation
of
pils
beers
in
the
fridge
this
is
the
closest
in
every
way
to
tipo
pils
which
i
consider
to
be
the
seminal
hoppy
pils
no
not
that
seminal
firestone
has
hit
a
hone
run
imo
as
an
aside
i
wonder
if
biracifico
italiano
will
ever
have
distribution
in
the
usa
refreshing
pils
with
a
smooth
hoppy
finish
this
pilsner
is
way
up
there
in
taste
sophistication
complexity
and
just
reeks
quality
if
i
didnt
live
in
downingtown
pa
home
of
victory
brewing
company
i
might
have
rated
this
my
favorite
pilsner
i
was
anxious
to
get
started
one
the
cap
was
popped
so
i
nearly
inverted
the
bottle
until
i
had
to
back
off
a
brief
pseudocascade
created
three
fingers
of
dense
puffy
bonewhite
head
with
great
retention
it
later
created
some
great
lacing
as
it
finally
fell
color
was
paleyellow
srm
1

with
neplus
quality
clarity
and
i
thought
about
my
last
stream
which
was
darker
than
this
nose
was
intensely
grassy
with
just
a
hint
of
biscuit
malt
this
had
better
be
identified
as
a
czech
pilsner
nope
i
was
offline
at
the
time
but
i
now
see
that
it
is
a
ger
pils
mouthfeel
was
medium
but
soft
as
though
they
had
tried
to
rein
it
in
a
little
so
as
not
to
overpower
the
casual
drinker
the
taste
was
definitely
saaz
hops
very
grassy
with
just
enough
malt
to
keep
the
dastardly
lion
and
his
hops
in
czech
i
mean
check
finish
was
semidry
perfectly
balanced
and
quite
refreshing
i
can
assure
you
that
if
they
were
to
begin
canning
this
beer
i
would
happily
fill
a
summer
cooler
with
it
lacks
the
fruitypineyness
of
victory
prima
think
more
of
a
slight
peppery
herbal
hop
accent
but
not
a
bad
lager
by
any
stretch
overall
this
just
might
be
the
perfect
example
of
what
a
pilsner
should
be
it
is
the
best
pils
i
have
had
to
date
awesome
my
favorite
pils
for
the
past
year
although
it
is
not
traditional
finally
starting
to
see
it
on
tap
here
in
l
a
3

o
overall
a
very
hoppy
pilsner
good
drinking
with
near
paleipa
hop
levels
sharp
palate
and
carbonation
great
flavor
overall
i
really
enjoy
pilsners
and
i
like
mine
more
on
the
bitter
side
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
this
isnt
hoppy
like
i
might
of
expected
from
the
name
i
can
see
where
they
were
going
by
focusing
on
a
cleaner
more
floral
hop
character
but
that
might
get
lost
in
other
peoples
minds
with
how
common
dryhopped
is
being
thrown
around
these
days
a
very
solid
pilsner
nonetheless
o
3

this
is
billed
as
a
hoppy
pils
but
i
dont
find
it
overly
hoppy
for
the
style
i
do
find
the
wet
vegetal
flavor
and
aromas
distracting
i
am
a
big
fan
of
firestone
walker
but
i
think
they
missed
the
mark
with
this
one
personally
id
rather
have
a
traditional
czech
pilsner
the
rest
except
for
a
somewhat
weak
aroma
this
is
a
real
solid
tasty
pilsner
much
enjoyed
march
2014
from
bottle
at
home
reminds
me
of
a
czechspatan
type
beer
slightly
lighter
in
texture
but
just
as
robust
in
flavor
aroma
is
more
insistent
than
the
actual
flavor
leaves
one
with
a
pleasant
dryness
vague
aftertaste
that
begs
for
more
refreshing
to
say
the
least
firestone
walker
never
ceases
to
impress
me
overall
firestone
walker
has
crafted
the
perfect
pilsner
it

does
not
get
any
better
than
this
poured
from

into

this
is
a
beautiful
clear

with
a
tight
pure

the
aroma
is
of
bread
and
light
malt
very
little
hop
aroma
at
all
taste
follows
with
a
clean
light
bready
flavor
and
no
hops
or
bitterness
to
speak
of
mouthfeel
is
great
a
perfectly
refreshing
beer
for
a
hot

this
is

why
arent
you
drinking
it

really
dry
a
great
example
of
the
style
overall
a
pretty
decent
pils
seemed
to
lack
on
flavor
a
little
bit
i
did
enjoy
it
however
pours
golden
color
with
very
small
head
and
mild
lacing
strong
tropical
fruit
aroma
malty
tropical
fruit
taste
especially
at
the
end
mild
hops
but
cannot
discern
any
bitterness
aftertaste
is
fruity
now
this
rating
is
based
on
a
small
sample
taste
at
a
bar
i
would
be
willing
to
try
a
full
glass
to
see
if
my
rating
changes
as
of
now
it
is
not
really
what
i
look
for
in
a
beer
i
can
see
the
potential
for
high
ratings
though
o
very
nice
beer
nearly
flawless
would
have
preferred
even
a
bit
more
hops
but
really
no
complaints
here
mouthfeel
is
very
light
crisp
and
thin
with
a
medium
body
average
carbonation
and
a
slightly
bitter
finish
that
that
trails
off
with
some
bready
or
grainy
notes
i
drank
4
of
these
tonight
so
its
a
definite
session
beer
to
me
as
i
found
it
very
easy
to
drink
id
visit
this
anytime
and
will
look
for
it
this
summer
as
i
could
easily
see
a
session
with
this
for
the
camping
weekends
drinkability
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
solid
recommendation
order
me
another
highly
recommend
taste
has
that
barley
haylike
nutty
grain
profile
so
prevalent
in
many
beers
of
this
style
pretty
strong
finishes
hoppy
for
style
as
the
name
indicated
it
would
the
noble
hops
provide
a
pretty
clean
finish
that
lasts
a
little
into
the
finish
actually
this
beer
is
just
flavorful
all
around
for
the
style
both
from
the
initial
grainy
barley
malt
bill
to
the
hops
at
the
end
very
solid
pils
here
i
was
worried
it
would
be
over
the
top
hoppy
for
style
but
that
was
luckily
not
the
case
ive
wanted
to
pick
this
up
for
a
while
now
but
never
pulled
the
trigger
today
that
has
changed
it
pours
a
clear
brass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
dirty
foam
the
nose
comprises
light
biscuit
strong
flowers
grass
and
a
touch
of
minerals
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
those
flowers
and
grasses
really
rocking
things
though
without
singing
the
tongue
nice
the
body
is
a
light
medium
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
crisp
finish
overall
a
solid
pils
one
i
could
easily
see
having
more
of
in
the
future
d
i
havent
sampled
too
many
american
pilsners
i
must
admit
but
this
is
just
delicious
really
puts
pilsners
back
on
my
radar
and
is
starting
to
grow
on
me
as
a
fw
favorite
the
body
is
light
and
crisp
and
it
has
a
great
hop
forward
flavor
profile
while
keeping
good
balance
tasting
very
fresh
and
green
while
satisfying
on
many
levels
i
will
enjoy
having
this
delicious
and
easily
accessible
hoppy
pils
here
in
california
pours
a
clear
straw
color
34
inch
head
of
a
white
color
great
retention
and
great
lacing
smells
of
citrus
hops
slight
sweet
malt
pale
malt
hint
of
yeast
and
a
hint
of
pine
fits
the
style
of
a
czech
pilsner
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
pale
malt
hint
of
sweet
malt
slight
hops
and
slight
yeast
overall
good
appearance
with
a
decent
body
and
aroma
for
a
czech
pilsener
overall
not
bad
really
however
theres
not
enough
pilsner
in
this
beer
really
it
probably
has
pils
malt
in
it
but
its
really
not
easy
to
taste
any
its
got
lots
of
citrus
flavors
which
as
you
read
above
predominate
some
bitterness
which
are
quite
reminiscent
of
noble
hops
it
feels
like
a
saphir
hop
beer
with
a
touch
of
pils
flavor
if
you
want
to
make
a
hoppy
pilsner
the
problem
is
you
need
to
start
with
a
good
pils
it
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
thats
all
hops
and
not
much
else
its
basically
not
very
balanced
and
for
me
i
like
strong
flavors
even
extreme
flavors
but
balanced
means
theres
more
than
one
note
being
played
ive
used
saphir
a
relatively
newly
developed
german
hop
that
has
some
and
its
got
some
citrus
flavor
to
it
but
not
this
much
basically
youve
got
a
semibitter
citrus
infused
beer
with
only
enough
pils
malt
sweetness
to
nominally
call
this
a
good
pils
i
love
that
they
used
saphir
and
tried
some
new
hops
but
id
rather
a
schönramer
mahrs
faust
or
kneitinger
try
it
with
their
normal
pils
now
that
would
be
a
wow
beer
i
get
the
feeling
fw
should
try
making
an
outstanding
pils
first
then
make
it
hoppy
its
hard
to
score
this
maybe
a
3
7
of
5
disappointing
beer
from
firestone
walker
overall
a
really
unique
pilsner
that
hints
at
american
engineered
and
classic
style
in
the
czech
realm
excellent
beer
and
the
adjective
bright
just
keeps
jumping
out
at
me
a
very
wonderful
and
unique
hybrid
lovely
o
i
hope
i
run
into
this
again
overall
this
is
a
killer
pilsener
great
complexities
in
the
hops
it
may
be
hopheavy
but
it
should
not
scare
away
those
antihop
beerlovers
12oz

virtually
no

the

the

insanely
drinkable

this

overall
this
is
a
hoppy
pilsner
worth
seeking
out
overall
like
victorys
prima
pils
and
six
points
the
crisp
this
beer
elevates
the
classic
pilsner
to
new
heights
by
balancing
classic
pilsner
flavors
with
appropriate
hop
notes
o
i
really
enjoyed
the
hop
aromas
and
flavors
of
this
beer
it
wasnt
overly
bitter
so
you
could
still
taste
the
underlying
bready
malts
a
knockout
hoppy
pilsner
this
really
hit
the
fuckin
spot
o
another
great
pilsener
a
beer
so
good
i
continue
to
be
shocked
more
people
dont
rate
these
higher
it
has
all
you
could
want
a
great
hop
bite
some
good
bread
malt
sweetness
a
smell
that
makes
me
keep
shoving
my
nose
in
it
and
a
feel
that
makes
me
reach
and
reach
and
reach
for
it
over
and
over
the
skunk
smell
will
put
some
people
off
but
it
shouldnt
this
is
a
damn
good
pilsener
this
is
a
very
good
pilsener
overall
this
didnt
last
long
in
my
glass
very
tasty
and
the
flavors
werent
drowned
out
by
my
spicy
dinner
this
is
light
bodied
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
super
crisp
and
enjoyable
it
starts
off
solid
and
gets
sulfuric
as
it
warms
and
loses
that
clean
edge
overall
its
still
very
enjoyable
thank
you
heath
overall
honestly
i
was
expecting
a
bit
more
perhaps
something
on
the
lines
of
prima
pils
and
i
found
this
to
be
closer
to
a
euro
lager
than
i
was
expecting
refreshing
with
a
great
mouthfeel
but
not
exceptional
the
taste
says
welcome
to
germany
or
the
czech
republic
because
the
grainy
sweet
malty
characters
of
those
traditional
pilseners
come
on
strong
with
a
modest
and
clean
hop
bite
that
is
not
floral
or
earthy
but
just
there
to
balance
it
out
yet
it
does
not
take
away
from
the
traditional
german
purity
recipes
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
pound
down
for
a
long
time
pours
beautifully
clear
straw
with
a
white
head
flavor
has
an
accent
of
hops
not
the
burst
i
was
expecting
with
the
label
hoppy
pilsner
on
it
but
it
does
have
a
nice
slightly
spicy
edge
to
it
also
a
bit
of
an
earthy
tone
as
well
i
like
it
this
is
the
best
damned
pilsner
i
have
had
that
was
made
in
the
u
s
i
can
see
why
todd
is
obsessed
with
this
one
o
this
is
about
as
good
as
it
gets
in
the
world
of
pilsners
hop
bitterness
pushes
the
envelope
but
stays
within
the
style
id
love
to
explore
some
cheese
pairing
options
as
this
should
be
able
to
tackle
bolder
cheeses
than
the
average
pils
maybe
an
aged
provolone
oi
enjoyed
this
i
would
offer
this
beer
to
friends
who
arent
super
entrenched
in
the
beer
world
and
i
bet
theyd
like
it
i
could
see
this
in
my
fridge
again
at
some
point
12oz
bottle
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
bottled
on
040314
indicated
on
the
label
pours
a
translucent
goldenyellow
with
a
fluffy
threefingered
bright
white
head
copious
tiny
bubbles
are
present
effervescing
insolution
and
adhering
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
some
residual
textured
spots
of
lacing
are
revealed
during
the
tasting
nose
is
grassy
and
expresses
light
pale
biscuity
malts
and
a
hint
if
lemon
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
consistent
with
nose
with
a
kiss
of
fruity
esters
and
a
light
residual
noble
hops
earthy
bitterness
at
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
crisp
nearly
clean
finish
just
an
all
around
excellent
czech
pilsner
so
glad
to
have
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
fresh
o
not
what
i
was
expecting
wanted
a
more
of
a
ipa
hop
taste
mixed
with
a
pilsner
feel
instead
got
mostly
a
pilsner
a
very
pale
yellow
color
in
the
glass
aroma
is
citrusy
mixed
with
minerals
a
nice
hoppy
edge
to
a
pils
as
the
flavor
really
stands
out
with
the
traditional
graininess
but
with
loads
of
hops
very
easy
to
drink
perfect
summer
ale
lacking
in
floral
or
spicy
hop
notes
this
beer
did
not
satisfy
have
had
from
a
bottle
as
well
and
did
not
enjoy
then
either
will
not
have
this
one
again
o
a
very
fine
brew
subtle
and
balanced
very
refreshing
clean
taste
with
a
slightly
elevated
hop
level
theres
a
good
round
pale
malt
base
with
just
a
touch
of
grain
the
swallow
is
lightly
peppery
but
gives
a
moderate
aftertaste
appropriate
body
with
an
above
average
carbonation
overall
this
is
the
best
creative
pilsner
interpretation
i
have
ever
tasted
maybe
this
isnt
loyal
to
the
purity
of
the
original
pilsner
recipes
but
this
might
be
my
favorite
pilsner
thus
far
a
delightful
pils
is
there
anything
firestone
doesnt
do
perfectly
o
solid
a
nice
clean
pilsner
with
some
slightly
different
flavor
profiles
i
really
like
this
beer
forget
session
ipas
this
will
do
the
trick
if
you
want
an
easysipping
yet
fullflavored
beer
o
im
usually
not
a
big
pils
fan
but
this
was
so
clean
and
drinkable
with
the
perfect
amount
of
hops
i
wish
this
was
available
in
my
area
as
this
would
quickly
become
my
goto
warm
weather
beer
this
bottle
went
down
way
too
fast
i
only
got
a
single
of
this
in
a
mixed
six
but
i
might
have
to
go
back
to
get
a
six
pack
when
i
see
it
again
the
date
is
121713
but
it
still
drinks
very
nicely
and
the
hops
still
seem
fresh
subtle
complexities
between
the
malts
and
hops
create
a
well
crafted
brew
overall
firestone
hit
it
out
of
the
park
again
with
this
perfect
crisp
summer
beer
it
has
hop
profile
for
some
ipa
and
pale
lovers
like
but
approachable
to
new
beer
drinkers
definitely
recommend
getting
a
6pack
of
this
deliciousness
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
very
easy
to
drink
and
nicely
balanced
i
took
home
a
growlette
not
knowing
if
this
was
commercially
available
glad
to
see
it
is
because
it
will
become
a
staple
in
my
fridge
i
fully
concur
with
the
bros
rating
of
100
this
beer
is
solid
and
i
encourage
everyone
to
try
it
o
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
not
a
huge
pilsener
fan
but
firestone
created
a
good
one
and
added
those
nice
and
plentiful
hops
overall
yum
simple
straightforward
crisp
and
refreshing
delicious
this
is
a
go
to
for
this
style
and
one
i
will
pursue
anytime
definitely
one
of
the
best
true
pilsner
i
tasted
if
not
the
best
balanced
with
a
bold
not
stupid
amount
of
hops
and
an
elegant
complexity
huge
drinkability
and
utterly
crisp
and
clean
taste
pours
out
a
pale
straw
with
lots
of
bubbles
raising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nose
is
clean
yeast
light
cracker
malts
and
heaps
of
floral
and
citrus
noble
hops
tastes
of
bready
malts
honey
and
again
loads
of
hops
earthy
herbal
floral
citrus
finishes
dry
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
light
a
perfect
example
of
a
balanced
albeit
on
the
hoppy
side
delicious
pilsner
overall
a
great
pilsner
somewhat
americanized
but
also
a
little
noble
pilsner
like
just
all
around
well
done
more
exciting
than
most
pilsners
the
beer
pours
a
beautiful
pale
yellowgold
with
a
nice
head
of
perfectly
sized
eggshell
white
bubbles
that
settle
to
a
quarters
fingerwidth
above
the
glass
and
demonstrate
a
nice
retention
in
body
the
beer
is
nearly
as
clear
as
water
with
no
particles
and
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
dancing
through
it
on
the
nose
the
beer
smells
of
buttery
cracker
malt
with
a
solid
bitter
herbal
scent
with
a
touch
of
mint
and
fresh
grass
on
the
very
edges
of
the
nose
stone
fruit
can
be
sensed
alongside
fresh
pine
needles
on
the
tongue
the
beer
tastes
superbly
bitter
upfront
with
wonderful
balancing
bready
sweetness
soft
acidity
from
the
hops
wets
the
sides
of
the
mouth
and
provides
a
very
very
light
pucker
there
is
even
a
soft
touch
of
earthy
salinity
in
the
beer
in
flavor
the
beer
tastes
of
bitter
grass
and
herbal
hops
mellowing
into
a
smooth
butter
cracker
malt
the
finish
is
blend
of
smooth
white
bread
and
grassy
bitters
with
just
a
touch
of
gooseberry
salt
and
a
mineralearthy
flavor
this
is
a
grassy
bitter
beer
at
heart
but
it
has
a
wonderful
balance
of
sweet
malt
and
minerallike
flavor
in
the
mouth
the
beer
feels
on
the
heavy
side
of
light
in
body
with
a
creamy
carbonation
and
a
definite
pricklycrisp
mouthfeel
that
leaves
the
mouth
refreshed
and
tingling
with
saliva
in
the
cheek
pouches
and
a
slight
neutrality
throughout
the
rest
of
the
beer
overall
this
is
a
superbly
hoppy
pilsner
with
awesome
subtle
complexity
the
beer
is
refreshing
and
perfect
to
nearly
session
overall
pretty
solid
pilsner
i
dig
it
classic
and
nice
hop
characteristics
overall
nice
and
juicy
pils
really
well
crafted
and
a
pleasant
surprise
had
a
pint
and
would
definitely
go
back
for
more
overall
seems
like
a
pretty
bang
on
representation
of
the
style
quite
drinkable
and
very
refreshing
this
beer
is
fantastic
and
if
your
craving
a
solid
stateside
pilsner
this
is
it
so
glad
it
has
made
its
way
to
the
east
coast
i
hope
it
stays
fresh
a
solid
choice
this
will
be
a
killer
summer
beer
assertively
hoppy
which
is
a
good
and
bad
thing
loses
a
little
bit
at
the
end
but
its
wellcrafted
and
delicious
this
remains
one
of
my
top
pilsners
awesome
beer
overall
a
decent
pilsner
with
a
very
slight
bit
of
noticeable
hops
for
being
named
a
hoppy
pilsner
i
would
expect
to
smell
and
taste
a
little
more
hops
very
much
like
stella
artois
but
honestly
not
made
as
well
with
the
noticeable
diacetyl
8
49
for
6
pack
the
flavor
is
great
bitter
yet
not
harsh
hops
with
a
slight
herbal
and
peppery
flavor
with
light
malt
edge
and
mineral
yeast
with
some
floral
hops
and
dry
pilsner
malt
qualities
with
a
light
grassiness
in
the
background
the
overall
pleasure
received
from
this
pilsner
is
high
very
fresh
hop
flavor
with
enough
bitterness
to
be
a
hoppy
pilsner
and
still
have
great
drinkability
at
the
same
time
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
im
definitely
more
of
a
fruity
ipa
kinda
guy
but
i
could
see
drinking
a
few
more
of
these
overall
a
beautifully
crafted
delicate
pilsner
o
overall
a
decent
pilsner
but
a
bit
disappointed
after
hearing
it
was
great
also
was
expecitng
it
to
be
hoppier
based
on
the
name
but
oh
well
a
good
pilsner
none
the
less
easy
to
drink
for
sure
this
stood
up
against
pilsner
urquell
and
actually
won
out
this
beer
stacks
up
very
well
with
its
american
attempt
at
a
traditional
czech
pilsner
wonderful
hoppy
notes
while
still
holding
true
to
pilsner
notes
i
was
expecting
something
along
the
lines
of
a
prima
pils
but
its
not
it
hits
the
mark
perfectly
in
all
catagories
to
me
this
is
very
much
world
class
very
clean
another
home
run
for
firestone
they
now
how
to
brew
true
to
style
and
i
would
gladly
drink
this
over
many
imports
mouthfeel
is
rich
not
as
crisp
as
i
was
expecting
but
pleasant
overall
this
is
good
i
like
it
the
aroma
gives
way
to
the
palate
pretty
straightforwardly
malts
yeast
a
bit
of
bitter
on
the
back
end
as
mentioned
above
im
no
expert
on
pilsners
this
seems
like
a
talented
presentation
of
the
style
generally
crisp
and
clean
my
main
complaint
is
that
there
is
a
weird
afterfeeltastething
reminscent
of
baking
sodaalum
on
the
tongue
a
texture
that
is
difficult
to
put
into
words
this
is
an
ok
average
beer
when
compared
to
other
types
of
beers
such
as
ipas
but
in
the
pilsner
category
this
is
probably
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
but
i
dont
like
pilsners
take
that
into
account
when
reading
this
no
mistaking
it
this
is
a
pilsner
it
tastes
like
a
pilsner
and
looks
like
a
pilsner
but
the
taste
has
something
most
pilsners
miss
and
thats
some
flavor
set
this
beer
down
next
to
a
budweiser
and
just
by
looking
at
it
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
but
after
tasting
it
there
would
be
no
doubt
i
would
say
people
who
prefer
ipas
over
pilsners
and
lagers
will
still
not
really
like
this
beer
or
find
it
average
at
best
however
pilsner
drinkers
czech
and
german
beer
drinkers
will
find
it
refreshingly
better
than
most
pilsners
that
come
out
of
the
us
6
mos
out
from
the
bottled
on
date
but
its
been
refigerated
so
should
still
be
in
good
shape
hazed
straw
gold
big
hoppiness
and
bitterness
for
a
pils
even
this
far
out
from
bottling
the
dryhopping
stands
out
with
an
oily
grassy
flavor
complex
herbal
notes
are
nice
malt
is
minimal
simple
cereal
notes
dryness
is
spot
on
for
the
style
a
solid
pils
that
stands
up
well
to
all
but
the
best
german
examples
but
with
the
west
coast
dryhop
twist
that
sets
it
apart
the
beer
pours
a
very
white
and
clean
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
beer
itself
is
a
very
clear
and
yellow
gold
the
has
a
strong
hoppy
smell
that
is
balanced
out
by
the
sweet
pale
malt
smell
that
balances
the
beer
very
well
the
hop
smell
is
earthy
and
certainly
dryhopped
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
but
with
a
stronger
hop
taste
than
malt
taste
the
hop
is
as
bitter
as
the
smell
the
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
with
biting
carbonation
the
feel
is
very
crisp
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
overall
a
very
good
pilsner
and
better
than
some
of
the
others
that
are
available
o
its
cool
to
see
a
hybrid
style
displaying
some
of
the
best
qualities
of
each
good
in
its
flavor
and
extremely
good
in
its
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
solid
choice
no
matter
warm
or
cold
weather
o
while
drinkable
enough
clearly
not
what
id
call
a
pilsner
of
either
german
or
bohemain
variety
the
lack
of
any
real
malt
character
and
the
resiny
hop
bitterness
make
this
beer
more
akin
to
an
ipa
big
draw
there
no
than
a
pilsner
im
sure
this
is
firestones
answer
to
the
ipl
and
thus
the
excitement
from
ba
members
but
id
sooner
know
that
pilsner
on
the
label
is
giving
me
that
style
overall
a
rather
pleasant
and
easy
drinking
pils
with
a
slightly
higher
hop
profile
then
the
typical
pilsner
this
is
a
nice
switch
up
from
the
standard
pale
yellow
color
crystal
clear
thin
white
head
good
carbonation
light
lacing
this
beer
has
a
sweet
malty
aroma
with
a
lot
of
hop
presence
taste
is
malty
but
the
saphir
hops
really
come
through
nicely
in
the
taste
as
well
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
and
quite
refreshing
overall
a
damn
tasty

up

moves
into

flavor
surprising
for
a
pilsner
light
bready
and
candy
malt
flavors
move
in
as
well
slight
acidity
to
the
finish
gives
the
malt
a
nice
twang
mouthfeel
is
light
beer
is
well
carbonated
gives
it
a
nice
bite
overall
this
is
a
spectacular
beer
i
am
not
to
sure
about
this
being
a
very
authentic
german
pilsner
but
it
is
certainly
delicious
an
unparalleled
home
run
from
the
folks
at
paso
robles
this
is
a
beer
that
crosses
off
all
the
boxes
for
me
pretty
much
a
flawless
beverage
in
my
opinion
the
hop
profile
may
chase
some
folks
away
but
that
just
means
theres
more
for
me
awesome
pours
light
yellow
lots
of
bubbles
small

sudsy

with
all
the
interesting
competition
from
crazy
new
breweries
in
southern
california
im
glad
to
see
these
guys
continuing
to
set
standards
for
quality
from
the
12
oz
bottle
purchased
at
bottlecraft
in
san
diego
o
a
nice
american
take
on
a
german
pils
dry
finish
but
not
very
clean
there
is
a
big
toasted
biscuit
aftertaste
that
is
a
bit
distracting
hats
off
to
firestonewalker
again
this
might
have
dethroned
victory
prima
pils
as
my
favorite
us
made
pilsner
glad
to
see
a
good
lager
come
from
the
west
well
done
very
good
if
slightly
bland
german
pils
here
could
use
a
bit
more
malt
character
or
tweaking
of
the
water
to
bring
forward
qualities
other
than
a
perception
of
cleanliness
maybe
but
im
nitpicking
now
overall
a
solid
hoppy
pils
this
goes
beyond
being
a
solid
pilsner
i
grabbed
a
single
12oz
and
wish
i
had
picked
up
the
full
sixer
im
pretty
sure
this
will
be
my
hardly
strictly
bluegrass
brew
this
year
one
of
the
better
americanmade
pilsners
to
come
across
my
palate
at
three
months
old
theres
still
a
lot
of
life
in
this
beer
not
only
a
quality
beer
but
one
of
the
biggest
surprises
of
2013
o
a
nicely
brewed
pils
and
very
enjoyable
ov
a
bit
underwhelming
tbh
a
decent
pilsner
but
not
as
hoppy
as
advertised
imo
i
just
didnt
get
enough
of
the
saphir
hop
flavour
nor
much
spiciness

this
beer
is
worth
a
try
and
worthy
of
purchasing
over
and
again
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
sam
adams
perfect
pint
appearance
is
extremely
light
with
a
yellow
tint
white
head
forms
and
leaves
considerable
amount
of
lacing
the
smell
presents
a
heavy
presence
of
bready
grain
paired
with
earthy
and
piney
hops
the
hops
provide
a
significant
pine
and
lemon
quality
towards
the
end
the
taste
starts
with
a
smooth
light
malt
profile
and
then
followed
by
a
heavy
wave
of
citrusy
hops
which
present
lemon
zest
grass
and
toast
mouthfeel
is
light
and
well
carbonated
overall
this
is
exactly
as
advertised
a
hoppy
pils
the
bite
at
the
end
is
strong
which
detracts
from
the
refreshing
qualities
of
this
brew
but
a
nice
pilsner
nonetheless
a
smooth
tasting
clean
and
refreshing
classic
pilsner
this
one
will
definitely
have
a
spot
in
my
goto
lagerpilsner
purchases
excellent
all
around
pils
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
medium
intensity
which
results
in
this
foaming
up
modestly
on
the
palate
quite
quickly
yielding
a
soft
smooth
mouthfeel
that
fits
the
beer
and
style
well
closes
quite
dry
with
little
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
or
lips
overall
i
think
firestone
will
get
its
loyal
fans
hooked
on
the
design
and
the
hoppiness
but
not
me
sadly
and
im
not
a
firestone
hater
by
any
means
i
just
bought
two
bottles
of
their
new
double
dba
release
and
loved
it
the
first
bottle
i
mean
the
second
is
for
aging
i
just
dont
feel
the
need
to
buy
this
one
again
o
while
better
then
your
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
it
still
leave
a
good
amount
to
be
desired
in
my
opinion
then
again
i
am
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
i
was
hoping
that
this
would
be
the
pilsner
to
change
my
mind
about
the
style
maybe
ill
try
the
victory
prima
pils
really
an
interesting
approach
to
the
style
not
sure
that
the
classic
pilsner
drinker
would
appreciate
this
beer
but
a
great
twist
if
you
are
a
hop
head
and
are
looking
for
a
great
summer
alternative
that
is
at
the
upper
end
of
sessionable
you
should
give
this
beer
a
try
overall
a
very
smackable
beer
light
and
refreshing
perfect
for
summer
glad
fw
came
out
with
a
lager
that
is
world
class
o
probably
my
next
summertime
keg
well
done
o
a
really
great
hopped
up
pilsner
that
is
refreshing
and
flavorful
definitely
a
beer
i
would
get
again
on
hot
summer
day
like
today
right
out
there
with
prima
pils
for
hoppy
pilsners
a
good
tasting
beer
a
bit
too
much
hops
for
a
pivo
pils
still
it
isnt
overpowering
spice
and
grassiness
are
at
low
levels
malt
is
very
thin
nothing
bad
with
this
beer
and
would
rate
it
higher
if
hops
were
tamer
pours
a
yellowish
sandy
golden
with
a
white
head
aroma
is
cereal
graininess
lemongrass
and
actual
grass
flavor
pretty
much
followed
suit
a
thinner
active
mouthfeel
overall
a
solid
beer
not
really
a
style
i
am
usually
into
but
did
enjoy
this
one
all
things
considered
overall
solid
beer
that
definitely
mocks
the
postprohibition
american
pilsner
definitely
worth
at
try
or
just
grab
a
six
pack
12oz
bottle
bottled
on
61013
pale
golden
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
foam
atop
the
lager
beer
aromas
are
pilsener
malt
grassy
noble
hop
spicy
slight
fruitiness
faint
chardonnay
tastes
are
bold
with
a
nice
toasty
grain
flavor
initially
along
with
biscuit
grassy
hop
pilsener
malt
finishing
pungentlysemibitter
if
that
makes
sense
it
lingers
lighttomedium
body
abundant
carbonation
hoppier
than
the
usual
german
pilsener
but
it
is
acceptable
since
they
do
announce
it
on
the
label
i
like
it
o
thumbs
up
ale
drinkers
should
not
fear
when
drinking
this
beer
nice
session
beer
this
beer
combines
nice
flavors
with
a
good
drinkability
the
sweet
flavor
is
balanced
bit
a
slight
tang
and
mild
bitterness
nothing
over
the
top
yet
flavorful
o
polished
off
a
6
pack
off
this
right
damn
quick
there
are
some
tremendous
pilsners
being
brewed
in
the
usa
at
this
point
and
this
is
another
of
them
drink
fresh
and
soon
overall
this
is
pretty
good
but
i
would
like
more
hops
the
verdict
good
beer
not
your
average
pilsner
this
hoppy
brew
almost
ventures
into
ipa
territory
pils
purists
may
not
be
happy
but
hopheads
may
find
a
new
favorite
o
overall
this
is
a
huge
surprise
for
me
from
an
excellent
brewery
who
is
known
for
bold
and
heavy
flavors
the
fact
that
they
took
a
beer
that
is
so
tough
to
brew
and
made
an
excellent
example
of
this
only
speaks
to
how
good
a
brewery
fw
really
is
this
is
now
officially
replacing
prima
as
my
go
to
pils
i
plan
on
keeping
an
ongoing
rotation
of
this
in
my
fridge
all
year
round
this
is
great
stuff
and
absolutely
perfect
for
the
warmer
weather
pilsners
are
hard
to
make
especially
in
this
caliber
and
its
remarkable
that
a
brewery
like
fw
churned
one
out
of
all
breweries
could
be
my
new
favorite
american
made
offering
in
the
style
i
will
be
buying
more
six
packs
of
these
for
sure
the
body
was
crisp
clean
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
was
excellent
several
would
go
down
easily
overall
an
excellent
brew
this
could
be
the
craft
beer
with
the
reach
to
truly
start
getting
mainstream
aal
drinkers
into
better
beer
a
very
good
pilsner
crisp
and
refreshing
but
it
also
has
some
heft
to
it
tasty
and
easy
to
put
down
nice
to
see
firestone
add
a
lager
to
the
lineup
they
did
their
quality
and
brand
justice
here
o
a
pretty
good
hoppy
pilsner
ive
wanted
to
try
this
one
for
a
little
while
and
finally
got
around
to
picking
it
up
today
im
a
little
disappointed
but
mostly
on
the
back
of
very
high
expectations
for
fw
brews
this
is
another
good
one
from
them
though
if
i
do
my
best
to
decouple
my
expectations
and
my
actual
experience
o
cold
this
is
a
light
refreshing
highly
drinkable
brew
warmed
it
had
even
greater
character
either
way
a
real
class
beer
from
a
real
class
brewer
fans
of
german
pilseners
will
probably
enjoy
this
tremendously
bottle
picked
up
locally
the
other
day
enjoyed
from
a
firestone
walker
snifter
brew
pours
a
transparent
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
fizzy
head
that
fizzled
away
kind
of
quickly
leaving
some
fizzy
patches
on
the
surface
smells
of
crisp
hop
taste
is
classic
pilsner
with
some
subtle
bitterness
on
the
finish
and
soft
fruit
notes
on
the
top
toasted
german
malts
easy
drinker
and
nice
pilsner
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
great
representation
if
the
style
hopforward
but
still
balanced
this
is
a
nice
take
on
a
german
pilsner
without
straying
too
far
from
the
classic
style
very
easy
drinking
but
with
a
complex
flavor
profile
the
palate
opes
quite
crisp
with
a
pleasant
modest
hoppy
bitterness
thats
a
blend
of
earth
and
lemon
mineral
character
is
low
accentuating
the
soft
malt
character
the
mild
dms
and
unfortunately
the
soap
mediumlight
in
body
moderately
slick
on
the
palate
this
beer
lacks
the
bitterness
it
needs
to
fully
tie
it
together
carbonation
is
high
but
quite
creamy
and
pleasant
a
touch
watery
on
the
finish
along
with
a
little
citrus
this
beer
is
quite
decent
this
poured
with
an
amazing
clarity
as
true
to
form
golden
straw
in
color
it
has
a
light
grassy
hop
aroma
which
i
love
in
a
fresh
pils
and
flavor
just
about
everywhere
crisp
clear
and
with
a
bright
clean
finish
its
everything
i
want
in
a
pils
until
i
get
back
to
texas

high
c
overall
a
good
domestic
pils
mild
with
a
nice
hop
zing
that
lets
you
know
this
is
from
firestone
and
not
anheuser
busch
the
much
hyped
new
beer
drinkers
pilsener
from
firestone
it
didnt
blow
me
away
ill
say
that
on
tap
at
the
new
renegade
publik
house
it
pours
a
perfectly
clear
watery
golden
color
with
an
inch
of
white
head
that
slowly
dies
the
nose
is
not
nearly
as
hoppy
as
the
press
release
declared
but
i
do
get
a
bit
more
than
the
standard
american
barley
malt
on
the
light
side
balanced
it
is
refreshing
but
the
hops
dont
quite
take
away
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
very
little
bitterness
to
this
only
a
mild
hop
flavor
maybe
leaning
on
the
floral
side
but
this
certainly
does
not
redefine
the
genre
as
it
was
supposed
to
do
its
plenty
drinkable
through
these
go
back
like
water
after
a
jog
the
body
is
ultra
light
and
the
carbonation
is
robust
it
just
tastes
like
very
other
craft
pilsener
there
is
nothing
new
or
special
about
this
one
too
simple
for
me
to
get
off
on
but
its
well
made
like
all
firestone
beers
but
ill
stick
to
their
solace
for
summer
time
assuming
that
one
comes
back
around
sign
raul
up
yep
light
yellow
golden
body
with
a
oneinch
foamy
white
head
that
faded
into
a
faint
collar
complex
spotty
lace
was
left
down
the
glass
the
nose
is
light
with
hints
of
cracked
grains
and
earthy
hops
clean
overall
the
taste
follows
the
nose
with
earth
hops
a
touch
of
sweet
fruit
citrus
faint
bubblegum
yeast
and
crisp
minerals
crispy
clean
medium
body
with
even
carbonation
a
solid
pilsner
could
be
dryer
but
its
got
a
great
flavor
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
amazing
in
its
simplicity
and
incredibly
enjoyable
one
of
the
best
lagers
made
in
the
us
and
i
am
glad
i
can
now
get
a
six
pack
pretty
much
whenever
i
want
overall
really
good
pilsner
maybe
not
as
hoppy
as
advertized
still
clean
and
flavorful
id
definitely
drink
it
again
and
again
and
again
edit
tried
from
the
bottle
and
enjoyed
it
more
thin
prickly
body
that
wasnt
satisfying
to
drink
simple
pils
flavor
but
lacks
the
drinkability
of
a
classic
example
also
lacks
the
complexity
and
full
body
of
a
prima
overall
forgettable
like
a
generic
brewpub
blonde
it
isnt
badly
made
but
there
are
a
number
of
other
pale
lagers
id
go
with
first
overall
my
favorite
american
pilsner
and
one
of
firestone
walkers
best
beers
this
one
sets
the
bar
great
pairing
with
so
many
foods
great
for
a
hot
day
and
the
perfect
beer
for
floating
around
a
pool
drink
this
was
good
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
hopefully
the
bottle
version
will
be
as
good
next
year
very
good
for
a
pilsner
and
a
great
start
for
my
first
firestone
experience
in
paso
robles
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
swaths
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
grass
and
hay
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
herbal
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
refreshing
and
very
easy
to
drink
picked
up
because
i
love
the
style
and
knew
it
came
from
an
area
that
i
know
i
like
the
beer
a
finger
head
and
golden
color
smell
is
a
bit
skunky
the
taste
is
clean
crisp
refreshing
maybe
a
very
tiny
bit
skunky
but
in
a
good
way
on
the
same
level
as
becks
for
me
if
i
wanted
this
style
id
go
to
this
or
becks
good
beer
great
bitter
beer
with
a
smooth

great
outside
summer
beer
ive
been
drinking
this
brew
for
along
time
its
my
go
to
outside
work
beer
if
you
like
skunky
german
lagers
youll
enjoy
this
not
interested
in
this
style
a
light
lager
easy
drinking
not
much
complexity
but
that
is
the
point
not
a
really
bad
beer
just
a
little
light
for
me
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
the
color
reminded
me
much
of
that
of
miller
lite
golden
in
color
with
a
head
that
does
not
last
more
than
a
few
seconds
i
personally
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
as
it
goes
down
smooth
and
very
drinkable
taste
was
good
not
great
but
good
i
bought
a
12
pack
and
shared
them
with
the
guys
and
they
thought
it
was
quite
good
as
well
feel
smooth
overall
i
was
happy
with
the
beer
and
enjoy
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
it
had
a
way
better
taste
than
its
smell
very
smooth
drinking
beer
with
a
good
taste
i
think
it
fills
that
niche
well
id
recommend
it
think
stella
artois
or
pilsner
urquell
bad

i

instead

that
in

this

it

better

with

many

taste
reminds
me
of
my
days
in
germany
while
in
the
army
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
not
a
lot
of

the
smell
was
a
bit
skunky
the
taste
turned
out
to
be
very
mild
in
the
beginning
leading
to
a
skunky
aftertaste
checked
the
dates
just
to
be
sure
but
it
must
be
either
the
green
bottle
or
just
the
beer
that
is
not
very
appetizing
to
me
relatively
malty
aroma
is
a
little
more
appealing
than
the
more
hoppy
flavor
grassy
hops
linger
on
and
on
in
the
mildly
bitter
aftertaste
overall
just
another
bad
example
of
how
to
package
beer
uninspired
pilsner
more
of
a
macrotype
lager
than
a
real
pils
some
people
may
not
even
be
familiar
with
the
differences
but
these
import
lagers
ive
tried
in
both
green
and
brown
bottles
they
always
taste
better
in
the
brown
bottle
and
its
easily
noticeable
the
green
bottle
gives
the
beer
an
almost
sour
sweetness
and
the
brown
bottle
has
a
more
natural
grainy
tasting
sweetness
without
the
sour
flavor
which
is
also
referred
to
as
a
skunky
flavor
the
thing
ive
noticed
is
that
when
i
purchase
a
12
pack
package
of
this
st
pauli
girl
beer
since
the
beer
is
not
exposed
to
light
the
beer
taste
more
like
it
should
taste
without
that
certain
skunky
sweetness
i
pour
it
into
a
glass
from
a
distance
to
get
rid
of
the
extra
carbonation
put
in
it
and
it
taste
absolutely
awesome
over
a
6
beer
drinking
session
i
just
suggest
to
get
it
in
the
12
pack
package
so
that
the
beer
has
not
been
effected
by
light
there
are
hundreds
of
much
better
beers
out
there
dont
waste
money
on
this
crap
this
beer
is
just
ok
for
me
i
consider
this
a
ladys
beer
because
my
wife
really
likes
it
and
so
do
most
of
the
women
who
drink
beer
i
cant
imagine
going
to
the
corner
bar
and
ordering
one
of
these
it
taste
best
on
a
hot
summer
day
for
a
4
6
abv
it
has
great
flavor
for
those
who
like
hoppy
and
an
abv
of
7
or
more
this
is
not
to
your
liking
the
flavor
also
has
those
pale
toasted
malts
but
there
is
also
a
delicate
sweetness
that
introduces
itself
to
the
mix
and
a
clean
dryish
finish
everyone
remembers
their
first
girl
right
well
its
not
my
first
so
i
remember
my
last
overall
nothing
really
special
here
a
dry
lager
that
unfortunately
due
to
the
desire
to
put
in
a
green
bottle
has
a
slightly
skunky
flavor
with
a
big
skunk
aroma
nothing
too
special
but
not
insanely
offensive
either
overall
for
an
imported
german
brew
i
was
not
disappointed
however
it
is
better
in
a
12
pack
the
green
bottles
let
in
light
6
packs
let
in
lots
of
light
12
packs
dont
f
y
i
overall
this
beer
is
ok
but
just
lacks
the
refinement
of
some
other
german
pilsners
while
the
price
is
good
i
would
take
a
bitburger
over
this
any
day
o
2
50
its
just
not
that
great
its
not
horrible
like
budweiser
or
miller
lite
but
it
is
a
subpar
beer
with
heineken
somehow
being
better
than
this
comon
local
party
store
stock
some
quality
authentic
german
lager
not
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
very
thin
white
head
some
lacing
was
seen
which
each
sip
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
rise
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
but
good
carbonation
the
aroma
is
on
the
strong
side
and
just
of
grains
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
and
is
of
grain
goes
down
pretty
easy
overall
its
not
too
bad
i
really
like
this
beer
traveled
europe
canada
and
sa
for
work
and
have
had
several
hundred
types
yes
it
is
like
heineken
but
more
everything
listen
people
rated
mirror
pond
and
sierra
nevada
for
its
high
alcohol
content
people
tend
to
like
to
get
a
kick
especially
when
you
drink
lots
im
a
phd
and
know
that
from
all
the
alcoholics
i
see
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
cheers
o
nothing
special
here
and
since
they
use
green
glass
bottles
it
suffers
the
fate
of
the
skunk
not
a
lot
of
flavor
in
this
beer
so
i
will
not
likely
be
picking
it
up
again
overall
this
is
a
subtle
but
well
crafted
beer
true
to
style
but
with
quality
easy
to
underestimate
this
one
people
who
compare
this
to
bud
or
american
macros
are
way
off
only
water
malted
barley
hops
and
yeast
drink
a
few
and
actually
taste
it
i
was
glad
to
see
it
has
the
german
purity
decree
stated
on
the
bottle
i
am
looking
for
a
beer
with
no
sugar
not
topfermenting
that
is
the
straight
3
ingredients
however
i
am
also
looking
for
organic
st
pauli
girl
has
too
much
carbonation
and
could
not
get
the
taste
of
metal
from
the
bottle
cap
out
of
my
mouth
what
happened
to
the
old
swingtop
bottles
i
was
in
need
of
a
roach
clip
o
just
okay
nothing
more
i
will
drink
if
offered
to
me
but
i
probably
wont
be
buying
again
rather
enjoyed
this
beer
would
have
it
again
the
taste
and
feel
are
light
crisp
and
refreshing
with
tons
of
grain
and
cereal
malt
very
easy
on
the
palate
and
stomach
its
an
easy
drinking
brew
with
a
lot
of
flavor
even
if
that
flavor
is
rather
one
dimensional
this
beer
is
seriously
mediocre
i
bought
it
cause
i
was
like
oh
german
beers
abide
by
the
bavarian
purity
law
so
this
probably
has
less
weird
chemicals
in
it
than
american
beers
but
yeah
it
tastes
just
like
bud
or
natty
not
worth
the
money
for
such
a
low
alcohol
contentthough
it
did
start
to
taste
better
after
id
had
a
few
o
overall
it
was
a
decent
pils
and
a
great
palate
washer
this
is
a
truly
wonderful
beer
i
believe
it
is
a
wheat
beer
style
which
is
comparable
to
heinekin
in
taste
it
pours
a
clear
seethrough
golden
yellow
with
little
acrid
aroma
and
no
head
although
i
did
pour
it
at
an
angle
so
that
it
wouldnt
lose
too
much
carbonation
into
a
regular
glass
as
i
have
yet
to
get
some
good
beer
glasses
it
has
a
wonderful
taste
and
when
you
inhale
upon
drinking
an
aroma
to
match
it
is
a
very
good
cheap
beer
i
believe
i
paid
3
with
tax
for
a
pint
i
also
believe
this
has
a
faint
aftertaste
of
red
apple
although
it
is
barely
noticeable
as
far
as
lighter
beers
go
this
is
one
if
the
better
ones
ive
had
in
recent
memory
granted
those
have
mostly
american
lights
really
hard
to
tell
the
difference
between
this
and
any
american
macro
avoid
at
all
costs
o
a
solid
macro
pilsner
nothing
to
really
hate
of
love
about
this
beer
its
in
the
middle
pours
a
clear
straw
color
54
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
slight
lacing
smells
of
strong
pale
malt
slight
sweet
malt
slight
hops
hint
of
caramel
malt
and
a
hint
of
sulfur
fits
the
style
of
a
german
pilsner
mouth
feel
is
sharp
and
crisp
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
strong
pale
malt
hint
of
metallic
slight
hops
hint
of
sweet
malt
hint
of
sulfur
and
a
hint
of
caramel
malt
overall
good
appearance
but
aroma
and
body
are
hurt
by
hint
of
sulfur
and
metallic
notes
i
try
as
many
different
beers
as
anybody
and
this
is
one
i
keep
comming
back
to
i
agree
with
the
reviewer
about
freshness
it
really
does
make
a
difference
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
and
one
of
my
all
time
favorites
german
lagers
must
be
my
taste
preference
enjoy
i
have
a
12
pack
chillin
in
the
fridge
right
now
waiting
for
saturday
afternoon
i
cant
wait
this
is
a
pretty
typical
euro
lager
its
musty
skunky
comes
in
a
green
bottle
and
has
a
rather
simplistic
flavor
nothing
special
to
report
here
ill
avoid
in
the
future
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
foamy
12
inch
beige
head
that
fades
to
nothing
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
down
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
very
skunky
up
front
but
this
gives
way
to
some
grain
and
slightly
vegetal
aromas
taste
is
mainly
of
grain
with
some
vegetal
and
slightly
skunky
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
but
the
smell
is
quite
skunky
pretty
much
what
i
expected
drinks
better
than
most
american
light
beers
but
still
not
very
flavorful
or
satisfying
this
is
my
first
trying
of
this
beer
and
i
was
completely
underwhelmed
i
expected
more
from
a
german
import
i
do
not
recommend
this
beer
i
really
do
not
like
this
one
from
the
standard
green
bottle
poured
into
clear
dixie
cup
golden
pour
with
decent
fluffy
white
head
aroma
is
skunk
and
light
hay
no
sweetness
a
bit
of
dryness
taste
is
like
sucking
on
a
skunks
ass
why
do
breweries
continue
to
use
the
green
bottles
i
have
had
this
multiple
times
and
no
improvement
i
tend
to
prefer
the
standard
macros
like
bud
light
to
this
one
light
to
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
is
light
on
the
tongue
and
easily
swallowed
the
body
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
not
overly
noticeable
and
really
assists
in
the
finish
overall
this
just
doesnt
have
enough
flavor
or
presence
to
keep
my
interest
i
couldnt
even
buy
it
to
get
sloshed
because
its
another
ridiculously
priced
import
i
picked
this
beer
up
at
a
super
market
one
night
just
sampling
and
it
had
an
attractive
bottle
it
kind
of
has
a
cheaper
german
pilsner
taste
with
thin
head
i
wouldnt
want
to
drink
this
beer
in
public
it
looks
kind
of
girly
im
not
saying
this
is
a
terrible
beer
its
just
not
for
me
overall
not
as
bad
as
i
thought
the
metallic
flavor
on
the
finish
is
the
real
downfall
but
not
really
skunked
and
not
a
huge
mess
either
im
glad
i
tried
this
again
and
did
a
full
review
perhaps
i
should
give
other
piss
beers
a
try
again
this
i
would
say
is
worlds
better
than
the
macro
swill
of
u
s
and
to
tell
the
truth
im
a
little
glad
it
surprised
me
in
a
good
way
and
hell
at
least
i
got
some
entertainment
out
of
writing
this
overall
i
would
risk
the
purchase
due
to
the
green
bottle
again
this
is
a
winner

o
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
could
definately
be
better
i
heard
bad
things
about
it
but
i
wouldnt
say
its
horrible
o
not
so
much
of
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
like
a
german
pilsner
should
be
the
skunkiness
aroma
is
just
so
overwhelming
that
it
dominates
the
beer
would
recommend
ditching
the
green
glass
to
avoid
the
skunkiness
o
its
a
german
pilsener
brewed
in
accordance
to
the
purity
laws
so
this
is
one
thats
not
for
all
as
for
me
im
actually
unsure
if
id
have
this
again
probably
preferably
with
food
overall
the
smell
threw
me
it
smelled
like
it
had
gone
bad
but
other
than
the
smell
its
a
decent
beer
by
no
means
one
to
race
out
and
buy
but
good
enough
o
kind
of
a
bland
generic
beer
not
one
of
the
better
euro
lagers
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
nice
and
refreshing
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
that
i
would
purchase
again
i
would
drink
it
again
overall
not
something
i
would
ever
seek
out
again
it
might
work
well
as
a
camping
beer
but
even
then
there
are
bettercheaper
options
this
brew
poured
out
as
a
nice
looking
golden
yellow
color
the
head
was
white
and
fluffy
the
smell
of
the
beer
had
the
typical
german
lager
aroma
of
some
fresh
grass
and
some
aging
in
there
too
the
taste
of
the
beer
is
a
little
grassy
also
and
finished
with
a
crisp
clean
flavor
though
the
mouthfeel
of
this
one
is
light
crisp
and
clean
also
overall
this
brew
isnt
bad
but
i
prefer
the
dark
lager
over
this
one
personally
o
perhaps
this
is
the
curse
of
the
green
bottle
i
cant
recall
a
time
ive
had
a
pauli
girl
that
wasnt
a
bit
skunky
this
beer
isnt
terrible
ice
cold
out
of
the
cooler
you
could
do
worse
pours
a
clear
gold
color
with
nice
carbonation
and
good
white
head
smells
a
little
almondlike
maybe
a
little
grainy
with
some
definite
bready
characteristics
tastes
mostly
clean
with
a
sweet
tasting
finish
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
no
real
hop
character
to
speak
of
overall
a
decent
beer
a
good
german
brew
at
an
affordable
price
and
you
cant
beat
the
iconic
label
art
overall
this
a
very
decent
german
pilsner
in
my
book
not
sure
why
this
one
isnt
more
highly
rated
by
others
as
its
got
many
good
german
pilsner
characteristics
and
also
has
some
flavor
punch
to
it
not
bland
by
anymeans
however
it
does
get
me
hammered
quite
efficiently
though
i
regret
the
decision
to
buy
it
at
the
halfway
mark
it
is
at
that
point
that
i
stop
caring
the
beer
pours
a
light
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
exactly
what
i
expected
from
an
imported
beer
in
a
green
bottle
skunked
grain
and
nothing
else
i
am
holding
it
against
the
brewer
in
my
rating
since
it
was
their
choice
to
use
a
green
bottle
the
flavor
has
a
little
bit
of
skunk
but
not
as
much
as
in
the
aroma
i
also
get
some
grain
and
grass
notes
from
the
hops
thin
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
o
theres
nothing
interesting
about
this
beer
that
would
want
me
want
to
try
it
again
the
taste
is
very
bland
for
the
style
overall
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
had
great
smell
and
appearance
along
with
a
surprisingly
good
taste
the
dry
finish
is
the
only
downside
to
this
import
prosit
overall
an
ok
pils
would
rather
have
many
others
of
the
style
not
bad
but
probably
wont
buy
again
you
can
pass
on
this
one
and
not
regret
it
poured
a
1
5
white
soap
suds
head
clear
and
quite
light
straw
yellow
in
color
smell
from
the
moment
opened
and
from
arms
length
was
substantially
skunked
taste
was
a
pretty
standard
bmc
style
rather
watery
and
had
a
mild
but
bitter
finish
really
the
only
redeeming
quality
of
this
sample
was
the
buxom
blond
st
pauli
girl
on
the
label
overall
not
a
beer
to
savor
but
just
a
thirst
quencher
with
a
bite
wont
be
back
for
another
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
people
going
wooo
pours
nicely
into
a
red
solo
cup
a
clear
watery
strawyellow
with
fizzy
bubbles
and
a
small
head
that
recedes
to
practically
nothing
weak
scents
of
light
grains
and
greenbottle
skunk
pretty
much
the
same
in
the
taste
grains
rotten
hay
skunk
with
faint
hints
of
something
that
could
be
hops
light
mouthfeel
and
not
very
drinkable
at
all
unless
youre
drunk
already
oi
will
probably
not
drink
this
again
it
was
not
anything
special
very
dissappointing
i
have
heard
good
and
bad
things
about
this
one
and
really
just
wanted
to
see
for
myself
definitly
not
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
tried
but
something
i
will
do
my
best
to
avoid
in
the
future
overall
a
simple
beer
that
can
be
drank
easily
for
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
on
a
hot
day
i
can
pound
these
back
though
i
can
think
of
a
few
other
session
brews
that
i
dig
a
lot
more
not
bad
not
great
simple
taste
with
this
beer
no
overpowering
aftertaste
either
which
is
always
a
plus
not
too
filling
which
is
great
for
those
nights
you
just
want
to
enjoy
a
beer
also
a
decent
starting
lager
if
you
havent
tried
one
before
i
have
but
i
still
enjoy
it
overall
a
good
choice
if
you
are
indecisive
about
what
you
would
like
to
drink
overall
its
worth
a
try
if
youre
just
getting
into
european
beers
but
dont
expect
anything
great
this
is
just
a
typical
euro
lager
although
its
light
body
and
crisp
flavors
lend
itself
to
refreshment
also
beware
of
the
high
possibility
of
getting
a
slightly
skunked
bottle
ive
never
bothered
pouring
it
out
of
a
bottle
but
i
recall
seeing
someone
do
it
not
surprisingly
the
beer
is
a
translucent
golden
color
smell
is
rather
bland
consisting
of
mostly
grapefruit
and
skunk
the
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
and
tastes
like
watereddown
skunky
grapefruit
with
some
hay
or
grass
or
something
but
its
actually
pretty
drinkable
its
better
than
a
runofthemill
bud
light
or
keystone
but
not
much
it
is
not
a
filling
and
does
not
leave
a
bad
after
taste
im
not
impressed
but
its
still
drinkable
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2002
pours
pale
yellow
with
a
nice
white
fluffy
head
few
lacings
fruity
floral
aroma
taste
is
delicate
floral
some
bitter
hops
in
finish
one
of
the
better
light
beers
in
the
world
very
nice
if
stored
properly
a
nice
transition
beer
probably
too
bitter
for
the
macro
crowd
in
summary
perhaps
the
big
german
exports
here
are
no
longer
skunky
and
uncared
for
if
so
ill
be
a
customer
again
this
was
a
good
start
nothing
really
special
just
your
typical
euro
lager
not
a
bad
goto
if
your
choices
are
limited
lets
not
forget
you
review
the
beer
for
the
style
and
this
is
a
good
example
solid
and
representative
of
the
typical
german
lager
actually
tasty
and
drinkable
though
not
all
that
distinctive
notes
its
an
acquired
taste
as
is
all
beers
but
this
is
not
one
that
one
can
drink
on
his
or
her
first
beer
lets
set
the
standards
on
beer
with
something
a
little
more
worth
while
clear
and
golden
with
a
nice
head
present
that
recedes
to
a
thin
layering
with
some
decent
lacing
in
my
pint
glass
smells
pretty
sweet
with
a
definite
hop
aroma
noticeable
some
slight
citrus
and
grassy
notes
come
through
but
are
very
faint
taste
is
mild
and
smooth
starts
out
fairly
sweet
and
malty
but
not
overwhelming
with
some
light
grainy
characteristics
and
leads
into
a
nice
bittering
hop
presence
that
mingles
nicely
on
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
fairly
light
with
some
pretty
intense
carbonation
this
beer
finishes
a
bit
dry
but
overall
is
a
decent
and
easy
drinking
pils
d
i
poured
it
out
it
was
so
skunky
pours
a
pale
straw
quick
rush
of
white
head
diminishing
into
nothing
quickly
very
pale
scent
with
hints
of
fresh
grain
and
earthy
hops
very
pale
taste
sollows
scent
with
light
fresh
dried
grains
and
earthy
hops
no
off
charachteristics
just
light
weak
and
watery
with
highly
active
carbonation
very
forgettable
beer
do
not
like
that
skunky
aftertaste
and
dry
finish
i
used
to
think
that
i
just
dont
like
pilseners
but
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
prima
pils
oh
well
wont
be
going
back
to
the
girl
anytime
soon
notes
i
remember
when
st
pauli
girl
used
to
be
a
fairly
respectable
beer
either
my
tastes
have
changed
or
this
beer
is
now
trying
to
compete
with
american
adjunct
beers
this
is
the
second
time
ive
tried
this
beer
but
the
first
time
reviewing
it
for
ba
i
didnt
care
for
it
the
first
time
i
tried
it
but
this
time
and
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
a
fresher
bottle
because
it
is
fairly
decent
for
a
pilsener
i
wouldnt
particularly
recommend
it
but
it
isnt
bad
may
be
worth
a
try
rjt
oh
st
pauli
girl
had
a
friend
come
back
to
the
states
from
germany
swearing
by
this
as
his
party
beeras
it
is
a
pilsner
i
figured
u
could
knock
back
enough
to
get
cheerful
so
i
crack
the
bottle
and
and
st
pauli
girl
mustve
opened
her
legs
lol
pretty
skunkysulfury
but
wasnt
a
bad
brew
i
could
drink
it
had
a
decent
taste
not
what
i
expected
from
such
a
strong
smelling
beer
it
was
decently
crisp
and
left
ur
mouth
dry
so
a
decent
not
great
beer
id
drink
it
again
american
lagers
and
pilsners
but
with
more
of
a
grainy
nose
and
taste
would
pair
well
with
a
real
hot
day
could
be
rather
thirst
quenching
probably
wouldnt
seek
this
out
but
i
could
see
how
this
beer
could
be
good
for
someone
making
the
jump
to
craftbeer
d
all
in
all
average
to
below
better
than
some
things
out
there
but
there
is
an
awfully
lot
of
better
beers
than
this
and
the
dark
version
of
st
pauli
is
much
better
than
this
taste
is
of
not
as
much
as
i
hoped
a
bit
of
hops
and
otherwise
follows
the
nose
but
less
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
slightly
chewy
overall
definitely
comes
off
as
a
cheaper
german
import
strongermore
unbalancedharsher
than
becks
d
too
weak
for
my
taste
not
worth
it
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
white
head
that
has
some
decent
retention
though
not
much
lacing
the
nose
brings
some
light
grain
and
corn
the
taste
is
corn
straw
grain
and
some
very
faint
hops
light
feel
with
pretty
strong
carbonation
not
really
tasty
and
really
nothing
going
for
it
poured
this
fine
brew
into
my
pub
glass
and
it
gave
me
a
one
finger
head
of
thick
white
foam
the
color
is
medium
yellow
rating
a
5
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
i
like
the
smell
blending
of
orange
and
other
citrus
smells
with
malt
the
flavor
is
a
medium
well
blended
taste
of
baked
wheat
rye
barley
corn
and
a
hint
of
hops
full
bodied
feeling
in
my
mouth
good
amount
of
carbonation
with
a
feeling
of
pudding
i
like
this
beer
even
though
it
is
a
little
pricey
d
named
in
honor
of
a
hooker
or
hookers
for
export
to
the
us
way
to
go
shows
what
they
think
of
us
in
america
an
ok
brew
with
very
few
differences
within
the
style
to
make
it
noteworthy
but
if
you
like
beers
that
taste
like
slighty
gamey
boiled
eggs
i
would
say
try
it
but
if
not
with
all
do
respect
run
for
the
hills
drinkability
poor
it
looks
and
smells
ok
but
the
flavor
is
simply
bad
beer
is
grainy
and
oddly
bitter
with
a
sulfurish
aftertaste
its
mildly
sweet
up
front
but
carbonation
in
the
mouth
is
minimal
this
is
a
train
wreck
of
a
beer
if
possible
the
na
version
of
this
beer
is
actually
better
d
very
nice
4
9
good
malt
hop
balance
without
being
macro
bland
very
nice
considering
the
rep
its
garnered
overall
not
the
best
never
will
be
but
for
what
it
is
it
works
word
order
it
in
a
pinch
over
95
percent
of
this
list
lets
be
honest
this
isnt
the
best
germany
has
to
offer
its
highly
drinkable
though
for
a
person
who
just
wants
to
mindlessly
put
a
few
back
despite
its
lack
of
outstanding
characteristics
this
beer
has
always
been
highly
drinkable
and
still
is
poured
a
transparent
golden
color
with
about
a
12
head
that
quickly
dissipated
not
a
ton
of
smell
but
it
was
a
faint
hoppy
lager
smell
taste
was
malty
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
it
was
nicely
carbonated
and
was
thinlight
overall
it
would
be
okay
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
the
taste
isnt
really
hitting
the
spot
for
me
it
would
be
sessionable
and
maybe
a
good
way
to
ween
your
friends
off
budwiser
and
millercoors
although
it
is
still
owned
by
ab
and
get
them
onto
the
path
of
righteous
craft
brews
drinkability
is
good
not
an
impressive
beer
by
any
means
but
easy
enough
to
drink
crystal
clear
bright
gold
with
a
collar
of
fine
white
foam
and
a
smattering
of
soapy
bubbles
coating
the
surface
of
the
beer
sticky
lace
clung
to
the
glass
as
the
initial
head
fell
after
the
pour
there
was
a
sharp
sulfury
hop
aroma
immediately
after
popping
the
cap
but
this
dissipated
quickly
and
left
a
faint
maltiness
and
floralspicy
hoppiness
behind
didnt
like
the
flavour
so
much
it
started
with
a
dirty
malt
character
musty
with
acrid
spicy
hops
midpalate
the
finish
felt
watery
and
all
that
was
left
was
a
sulfury
mess
dry
and
light
bodied
average
carbonation
for
the
style
i
thought
this
had
promise
at
first
but
as
i
had
more
of
it
i
liked
it
less
overall
bland
goes
down
easy
and
not
bad
for
the
reasonable
price
at
the
outset
another
skunky
eurolager
but
that
particular
beasts
usual
aspects
are
suppressed
in
the
middle
long
enough
to
make
this
drinkable
when
there
is
distracting
sun
or
television
or
soccer
or
well
you
get
the
idea
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
a
very
clear
beer
dark
yellow
to
slightly
orange
head
poured
a
little
thin
and
lacy
but
not
bad
very
easy
drinking
beer
could
easily
see
it
being
a
session
beer
neither
very
hoppy
nor
very
malty
but
with
a
slightly
thin
mouthfeel
d
this
isnt
a
terrible
beer
in
fact
held
up
to
becks
heinikin
etc
its
solid
the
nature
of
shipping
and
skunking
just
leaves
this
beer
a
little
off
though
the
body
was
typical
for
the
style
and
drinkability
would
have
been
excellent
except
for
the
skunk
id
like
to
try
this
closer
to
the
source
sometime
it
is
worth
spending
the
few
extra
dollars
to
drink
this
instead
of
the
typical
american
corn
and
rice
garbage
tastes
skunked
nice
pils
bitter
character
to
the
finish
more
of
a
czech
pils
than
a
german
pils
but
there
is
some
supporting
malt
hop
flavor
aside
from
the
skunky
is
metalic
and
oranges
quite
dry
and
really
spicy
hop
zip
in
the
end
aftertaste
is
lingering
metalic
with
skunk
as
the
predominant
i
drank
this
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
mug
light
clear
gold
decent
head
lots
of
carbonation
super
clear
the
aroma
and
taste
are
both
light
hops
at
least
there
is
no
skunk
typical
macro
pilsner
smell
there
too
it
tastes
ok
nothing
special
but
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
id
drink
this
over
any
american
macro
but
a
lot
better
choices
out
there
the
skunkiness
does
get
old
fast
but
it
actually
isnt
bad
per
se
note
that
by
above
average
i
mean
its
good
but
not
what
i
would
consider
a
great
beer
it
surpassed
my
expectations
but
only
because
they
were
low
from
the
start
a
good
beer
in
its
class
and
something
i
would
drink
again
but
nothing
spectacular
here
this
beer
really
lacks
the
crisp
freshness
that
one
expects
in
a
german
pils
donce
again
decent
its
not
a
terrible
beer
but
its
also
not
that
good
glad
i
only
bought
one
bottle
now
i
can
move
on
to
something
better
reminds
me
more
of
a
pilsner
but
still
nicely
drinkable
nice
body
and
decently
flavored
which
would
make
this
a
fair
session
beer
notes
very
skunky
beer
not
one
i
suggest
getting
but
i
know
a
person
or
two
that
like
it
a
bit
more
grain
and
malt
than
some
lagerspilseners
but
not
a
great
beer
d
very
drinkable
not
to
heavy
and
not
to
light
basic
middle
of
the
road
pours
a
thin
pale
yellow
with
minimal
head
smell
of
alcohol
and
bacteria
taste
is
horrible
just
dont
bother
skunky
notes
overshadow
a
wimpy
malt
that
tries
to
make
your
tongue
die
too
carbonated
and
yukyuk
yuk
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
the
head
is
half
an
inch
in
height
and
recedes
within
thirty
seconds
into
almost
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
um
well
nothing
i
guess
its
not
the
worst
aroma
ive
come
across
in
a
beer
but
that
is
only
because
it
isnt
an
aroma
the
taste
has
some
faint
bready
malt
that
is
actually
quite
pleasant
no
hops
are
detected
the
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
but
not
too
high
overall
it
has
been
six
or
seven
years
since
i
last
had
this
beer
and
honestly
it
is
better
than
i
remember
it
that
is
not
saying
much
though
it
is
palatable
but
nothing
special
do
this
calls
for
a
6
pack
night
as
an
alternative
to
any
major
corporate
beer
notes
if
you
are
a
fan
of
that
green
bottle
import
beer
which
i
am
not
you
may
like
this
beer
however
even
i
like
other
green
bottle
imports
better
definitely
a
below
average
beer
d
pretty
drinkable
due
to
the
blandness
drinkability
its
one
of
those
beers
thats
instantly
forgettable
if
nothing
else
at
least
this
bottle
wasnt
riddled
with
skunk
drinkability
i
always
find
myself
grabbing
for
this
beer
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
nice
german
pilsner
even
though
they
dont
sell
this
in
germany
d
very
drinkable
since
there
isnt
much
taste
to
it
so
long
as
its
not
skunked
its
a
decently
drinkable
beer
a
just
descent
passable
beer
not
terrible
but
certainly
not
good
body
was
thin
and
wet
flavors
of
buttered
bread
and
corn
this
is
what
i
expected
it
to
be
refreshing
and
slick
this
is
an
easy
drinker
theres
better
lagers
out
there
no
doubt
but
this
would
be
alright
to
drink
with
some
grilled
fare
it
could
be
worse
that
being
said
it
doesnt
have
alot
going
for
it
taste
is
grainy
with
a
hint
of
molasses
at
the
finish
color
is
yellowish
with
a
white
head
smell
is
almost
not
noticeable
i
would
not
drink
this
ever
really
if
it
wasnt
one
of
my
dads
beers
drinkability
a
nice
little
pilsner
st
pauli
girl
has
earned
a
place
as
one
of
my
bands
regular
session
beers
pretty
average
beer
certainly
not
bad
and
considering
this
is
what
my
dad
has
stocked
for
the
christmas
party
when
i
got
back
from
college
ill
be
drinking
some
more
of
these
i
certainly
wont
complain
its
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
extremely
noteworthy
either
another
beer
that
i
had
not
touched
in
almost
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
marketing
slogan
used
to
be
you
never
forget
your
first
girl
to
be
honest
im
a
little
disappointed
well
at
least
im
nice
and
hydrated
for
my
next
review
st
pauli
another
euro
lager
possibly
the
most
famous
german
import
who
knows
where
this
is
brewed
today
appears
pale
fizzy
yellow
golden
with
a
bright
white
head
that
fades
quickly
with
minimal
lacing
aroma
has
cooked
veggies
with
rough
slightly
skunked
herbal
hops
this
green
bottled
lager
was
straight
from
a
12
pack
so
no
light
exposure
yet
flavor
is
really
minimal
slight
sweetness
mineral
water
tone
with
harsh
herbal
hop
bitterness
and
a
tad
of
that
skunk
note
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
much
like
carbonated
water
bad
finish
with
those
harsh
hop
oils
drinkability
is
what
it
is
a
beer
that
will
continue
to
be
solid
in
every
grocery
store
across
the
country
when
so
much
better
options
are
available
a
very
grainy
corny
taste
to
this
one
with
a
foul
twinge
on
the
backend
i
presume
those
were
hops
skunky
smell
and
very
fizzy
yellow
although
a
bit
of
head
forms
some
german
pilsner
qualities
pretty
easy
to
drink
believe
it
or
not
cheaply
priced
as
compared
to
say
20
years
ago
i
think
if
this
were
in
a
brown
bottle
it
may
not
be
as
skunked
and
may
be
a
decent
brew
d
actually
a
pretty
easy
to
drink
beer
but
not
incredibly
flavorful
decent
and
definitely
something
i
would
drink
if
put
in
the
situation
where
there
was
nothing
else
that
sounded
appealing
get
rid
of
the
damn
green
bottles
i
had
two
of
these
both
of
which
were
skunked
quite
a
disgusting
beer
a
friend
had
to
finish
both
for
me
the
mouthfeel
actually
has
a
decent
body
to
it
very
clean
and
the
drinkability
is
good
really
good
im
talking
mini
keg
to
your
self
good
d
not
very
tasty
goes
down
easily
since
its
pretty
light
not
too
filling
mild
kick
not
the
best
representation
of
style
there
are
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
di
like
this
lager
if
it
was
priced
right
i
would
buy
it
again
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
go
with
lamb
or
rabbit
the
crispness
and
bubbly
feeling
on
the
tongue
reminds
me
of
drinking
a
soda
so
it
could
also
be
a
nice
refreshing
beer
on
a
hot
day
d
dont
like
the
way
it
goes
down
it
is
a
little
rough

fairly

even
bad
german
lagers
arent
that
bad
good
drinkability
definitely
a
session
beer
low
abv
with
decent
flavor
not
the
tastiest
lager
around
but
not
bad
either
from
a
green
24
oz
bottle
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
quite
skunky
and
a
bit
offensive
taste
is
crisp
and
finishes
bitter
not
a
whole
lot
of
flavor
feels
a
bit
bitter
in
the
mouth
this
beer
does
go
down
pretty
smooth
overall
an
average
beer
appearance
is
light
golden
in
color
with
a
thin
crisp
head
smell
has
a
light
clean
aroma
of
grain
and
hops
taste
is
malty
with
light
hop
bite
mouthfeel
has
good
carbonation
and
light
body
overall
a
good
brew
a
bit
bitter
as
a
session
for
me
but
not
bad
drinkability
i
think
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
not
the
best
thing
ive
ever
had
but
i
could
drink
it
again
d
skunky
but
not
offensive
its
a
drinkable
import
enjoyable
in
quantity
and
ice
cold
but
not
quality
the
hops
arent
quite
as
forward
in
the
taste
although
theyre
still
there
a
little
bit
of
sweetness
and
a
littler
bit
of
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
no
heavy
malt
i
can
taste
a
lot
more
carbonation
than
i
can
see
all
in
all
very
comparable
to
becks
a
favorite
of
mine
its
not
a
work
of
art
but
quite
good
all
around
just
dont
let
pilsener
fool
you
into
thinking
youre
getting
milleresque
blandness
if
thats
what
you
want
look
elsewhere
pours
bright
yellow
with
a
half
inch
white
head
leaves
a
thin
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
husky
grains
slightly
of
pale
malt
and
a
good
amount
of
floral
hops
tastes
of
mildly
spicy
noble
hops
particularly
in
the
finish
some
sweetness
from
the
pale
malt
and
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
its
highly
carbonated
d
very
refreshing
beer
i
just
wish
it
was
handled
a
bit
better
to
avoid
that
skunkiness
id
gladly
drink
this
over
a
macro
anyday
however
compared
to
other
german
lagers
ive
had
this
lacks
a
bit
of
flavor
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
but
not
by
its
complexity
obviously
fresh
extremely
mild
hops
less
skunk
than
expected
scent
in
the
nose
when
poured
but
the
similarity
with
its
sister
pilsner
the
green
bottle
becks
brewed
in
the
same
bremen
brewery
ends
there
very
drinkable
smooth
beer
with
a
fresh
malt
flavor
and
a
delicate
hops
bitterness
emphasis
on
delicate
i
didnt
find
it
too
sweet
but
its
definitely
a
touch
sweet
perfect
carbonation
and
absolutely
good
drinkability
decent
stuff
i
dont
have
evidence
of
this
but
as
st
pauli
is
brewed
in
the
becks
brewery
in
bremen
and
sold
only
in
the
us
i
am
convinced
after
sidebyside
taste
tests
that
st
pauli
is
the
closest
thing
youll
get
in
the
us
to
becks
gold
if
it
isnt
the
same
exact
product
the
beer
pours
a
lighter
golden
color
with
a
huge
head
very
huge
head
and
i
pour
beer
correctly
also
it
is
by
far
not
the
first
time
i
have
poured
it
so
i
knew
what
to
expect
the
smell
is
the
benchmark
i
hold
for
german
beers
a
bias
high
marks
for
it
the
taste
is
a
little
on
the
weak
side
compared
to
other
german
beers
what
it
lacks
in
taste
for
german
beers
it
make
up
in
drinkability
i
would
guess
that
it
is
a
popular
hard
drinking
beer
in
germany
but
i
can
not
confirm
that
atmosphere
might
be
the
best
part
of
this
one
has
a
really
solid
look
at
least
nose
flavor
and
feel
are
all
okay
decent
quaff
d
this
is
built
for
session
drinking
on
the
cheap
i
found
a
12
pack
at
meijer
for
10
99
thats
less
that
eleven
dollars
so
i
broke
down
and
bought
this
stuff
i
would
pick
it
up
again
for
the
same
reason
i
did
this
memorial
day
weekend
to
wash
down
a
few
dogs
and
serve
to
friends
that
forgot
to
bring
their
own
beer
drinkability
a
bit
bitter
but
definitely
a
good
beer
no
problem
finishing
this
six
pack
when
pouring
from
this
oversized
1
pint
bottle
the
foam
was
very
light
wheat
in
color
bubbly
and
dissapated
somewhat
quickly
which
produced
a
small
ring
of
foam
till
the
end
the
color
was
golden
yellow
the
smell
had
a
nice
hops
and
wheat
ballance
with
a
flowery
hint
the
taste
was
smooth
had
a
light
wheat
tone
some
fruitiness
and
somewhat
dry
mouthfeel
crisp
and
lightbodied
drinkability
clean
crisp
and
dry
nothing
spectacular
just
a
nice
kickback
of
a
pilsner
the
green
bottle
made
ma
a
bit
apprehensive
at
first
but
the
flavor
was
not
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
very
much
an
average
beer
but
its
not
too
bad
but
there
is
a
total
babe
on
the
label
serving
two
foamy
mugs
of
lager
surely
that
is
noteworthy
sometimes
if
ive
been
drinking
entirely
too
much
st
pauli
girl
i
will
start
to
hit
on
the
girl
on
the
label
but
she
wont
talk
to
me
i
think
that
maybe
i
creep
her
out
but
if
i
creep
her
out
why
is
she
smiling
oh
the
things
i
would
do
to
you
a
very
average
beer
that
i
wouldnt
pick
if
given
a
choice
but
certainly
wouldnt
turn
it
away
either
if
youre
sometimes
forced
to
hang
out
with
people
who
drink
corona
bud
or
miller
youll
be
glad
is
some
of
these
are
around
if
you
hang
out
with
hopheads
though
you
wont
really
want
this
one
around
pretty
middle
of
the
road
d
overall
a
beer
that
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
isnt
the
best
thing
out
there
overall
drink
it
overall
run
of
the
mill
the
taste
is
slightly
drying
towards
the
finish
almost
salty
there
is
a
definite
a
metallic
or
sulfery
taste
to
the
beer
and
there
is
an
ever
so
slight
lemony
quality
to
this
lager
there
is
a
slight
corn
cooked
grain
quality
to
the
beer
and
a
tinge
of
sweetness
once
things
warm
when
the
beer
is
cold
there
is
more
dryness
and
saltiness
in
the
finish
as
it
settles
more
sweeter
malts
emerge
this
is
an
okay
beer
bland
drinkable
nothing
special
this
beer
is
sweeter
and
less
hoppy
than
i
recall
back
in
the
days
of
yore
surely
another
victim
of
mass
marketing
similar
to
yet
not
as
robust
as
becks
drinkability
is
very
good
on
this
would
be
a
great
session
brew
for
the
warmer
weatherrefreshing
and
thirst
quenching
ive
had
this
many
times
over
the
years
and
am
surprised
ive
never
reviewed
it
till
now
huh
anyway
this
is
nothing
spectacular
just
a
good
ol
german
pilsener
done
in
the
classic
style
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
crisp
about
on
par
with
most
lagers
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
but
it
isnt
a
good
one
either
at
least
a
skunky
flavour
when
i
first
opened
the
bottle
disappeared
after
a
few
minutes
the
best
thing
it
has
going
for
it
is
its
drinkability
i
wont
be
seeking
this
one
out
again
not
that
it
is
that
hard
to
find
d
ok
to
drink
but
for
the
freshest
pilsners
i
go
local
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
many
but
when
nothing
fresher
is
around
this
is
a
good
pils
drinking
this
old
school
straight
outta
the
bottle
piss
yellow
in
color
no
head
no
lacing
no
retention
some
crisp
hops
on
the
nose
with
no
real
malt
aroma
apart
from
some
sort
of
toasted
biscuit
not
appealing
but
not
repulsive
either
on
the
palate
theres
some
spicy
hops
up
front
with
a
strange
offflavor
with
some
cooked
vegies
and
corn
dry
hoppy
finish
great
carbonation
and
solid
finish
light
and
very
drinkable
overall
a
descent
beer
that
is
refreshing
and
simple
to
drink
uninteresting
and
nothing
special
about
this
german
lager
not
far
off
from
water
except
for
the
unpleasant
taste
yellow
pour
with
a
while
bubbly
head
typical
lager
aroma
lots
of
metal
and
rice
this
is
augmented
with
a
saaz
sweetness
more
bitterness
in
the
taste
with
a
grainy
tang
that
actually
goes
well
with
the
hops
like
a
heineken
with
more
flavor
and
without
the
skunky
aroma
the
taste
is
similar
with
the
stress
clearly
on
the
light
grassyherbal
hops
with
a
light
but
dominant
bitterness
its
a
bit
thin
and
minerally
with
a
mineralwater
quality
and
little
malt
characteristic
its
a
bit
weak
with
food
d
the
budweiser
of
german
beer
thought
i
read
this
is
brewed
with
a
lager
yeast
which
is
why
i
thought
it
drank
more
like
a
macrolager
then
a
typical
pilsner
which
it
is
described
as
horrible
off
flavors
and
packaged
in
a
green
bottle
to
add
insult
to
injury
needless
to
say
this
is
a
big
pass
an
disappointment
not
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
i
probably
wont
buy
it
again
just
because
there
are
beers
out
there
that
i
like
better
for
this
kind
of
price
however
its
not
bad
i
have
to
admit
i
hated
the
first
couple
sips
but
once
i
got
through
about
half
of
one
it
kinda
grew
on
me
and
i
drank
the
rest
no
problem
pours
a
light
yellowclear
colored
body
and
has
almost
no
head
has
a
strong
malty
and
alcoholy
aroma
a
finely
carbonated
palate
has
a
slightly
bitter
taste
clean
finish
and
a
light
palate
d
an
overpriced
import
lager
that
has
a
good
feel
but
not
a
lot
else
on
the
ball
its
interesting
to
revisit
some
of
the
imports
that
i
used
to
drink
this
being
one
of
them
rather
simple
pilsner
although
i
find
it
more
comparable
to
the
typical
euro
lager
nice
biting
aroma
slightly
hopped
good
initial
pour
head
soon
settles
and
there
is
decent
lacing
stuck
to
the
glass
mouthfeel
is
sharp
but
finishes
awkwardly
flavor
is
solid
crisp
light
malts
with
a
medium
bitterness
from
the
hops
this
one
isnt
bad
d
boring
but
good
a
decent
session
beer
that
goes
well
with
food
suckered
in
by
the
cleavage
i
bought
a
sixer
of
this
beer
out
of
the
bottle
this
brew
was
a
bleached
near
transparent
gold
color
with
a
white
had
that
was
short
lived
moderate
lacing
but
not
much
to
speak
of
the
aroma
was
at
first
rather
brash
macro
lager
horsesaddle
malt
and
wet
grain
individually
none
of
these
elements
is
inherently
bad
but
as
a
collection
i
was
turned
off
the
flavors
were
also
a
bad
mix
sweet
processed
malt
at
first
followed
quickly
by
a
bitter
hops
that
did
not
balance
properly
the
middle
was
vapid
weakly
thoughtout
and
unassertive
the
body
was
light
and
the
carbonation
too
much
for
the
price
one
can
do
better
and
when
you
really
get
down
to
it
the
cleavage
on
the
toothy
bottlegirl
was
the
best
part
ouch
you
could
do
worse
finally
a
nonskunked
bottle
certainly
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
but
it
gets
the
job
done
went
nicely
with
spaghetti
overall
another
mass
produced
pilsener
that
leaves
me
wanting
something
more
from
the
beer
i
found
myself
saying
is
that
it
d
average
again
if
someone
offered
me
one
i
wouldnt
turn
them
down
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
unless
theres
a
great
sale
on
it
drinkability
is
moderate
easily
sessionable
but
flavor
is
sub
par
not
the
greatest
lager
ive
had
but
it
definitely
isnt
the
worst
either
poured
a
golden
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
with
a
little
bit
of
lacing
the
head
tapers
off
quite
quickly
a
clean
mild
malt
aroma
slightly
floral
the
flavor
is
a
little
sweet
with
malts
and
a
mild
hop
bite
in
the
finish
a
touch
of
skunk
doesnt
help
but
overall
somewhat
drinkable
and
light
drinkability
wouldnt
pass
it
up
if
it
were
offered
again
but
why
pick
it
up
when
there
are
others
available
that
are
so
much
better
i
though
once
the
lightstruck
skunky
flavor
thanks
to
the
green
bottle
cleared
out
of
the
aroma
and
taste
there
might
be
something
worth
writing
about
but
i
was
mistaken
what
was
left
after
the
most
offensive
yet
richest
flavor
vacated
was
a
nasty
sour
fruit
tang
and
only
a
hint
of
actual
german
lager
flavor
yes
it
was
there
hiding
in
the
back
light
bready
malts
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
but
for
the
most
part
i
just
tasted
the
big
offflavor
that
i
assume
st
pauli
girl
considers
their
trademark
taste
move
along
nothing
to
drink
here
pass
poured
from
a
green
bottlelite
straw
color
with
bubbles
and
a
white
head
that
lingers
just
enough
for
appearance
and
mild
lacing
lite
skunk
hit
the
nose
but
not
much
considering
the
green
bottlea
little
cornwet
grass
and
grainsall
faintly
coming
at
younot
really
much
there
tasted
kinda
watery
with
the
grains
hitting
in
the
corn
too
with
a
kinda
mouth
puckering
tastenot
much
too
itvery
litei
guess
on
a
very
hot
day
and
this
brew
being
very
cold
it
would
go
down
good
but
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
itjust
not
much
for
flavor
not
a
bad
beer
but
just
rather
basic
pours
from
the
24oz
bottle
a
halfshade
darker
than
your
typical
macro
lager
a
2
finger
head
forms
settling
into
a
thick
collar
its
very
fizzy
countless
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
aroma
is
pleasantly
malty
with
a
slight
hint
of
corn
a
pinch
of
hops
the
1st
sip
brings
a
nice
crisp
hit
of
hops
saaz
bitterness
some
dry
grassiness
and
a
slight
lemon
citrus
bite
with
some
maltiness
in
the
background
for
balance
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
heavy
or
watery
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
macro
pilsner
not
quite
micro
quality
but
id
definetly
pick
this
over
95
of
all
the
other
massproduced
macro
beer
out
there
recommended
for
an
occasional
beer
probably
more
enjoyable
with
food
d
maybe
i
got
an
old
bottle
of
the
girl
but
on
initial
tasting
i
would
never
pick
this
up
again
maybe
ill
throw
one
into
the
6pack
on
my
next
trip
to
the
store
just
to
make
a
fair
assessment
this
is
just
an
awful
awful
beer
let
it
be
known
i
am
a
big
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
is
just
god
awful
poured
a
very
light
yellow
like
color
with
not
much
of
a
head
heavy
carbination
with
this
one
as
well
smelled
very
skunky
and
remained
that
way
through
out
got
a
bitter
taste
with
it
that
was
just
totally
off
this
was
my
first
drain
pour
i
just
couldnt
drink
it
good
thing
i
got
it
in
a
mixed
six
pack
this
is
a
favorite
of
a
friend
of
mine
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
like
most
imported
light
beers
it
was
a
little
pricey
for
what
you
get
a
clear
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
weak
tan
head
skunky
smell
of
stale
hops
and
light
grainy
malts
not
much
in
the
flavor
area
a
little
bitter
hoppiness
with
some
grains
a
light
body
with
too
much
carbonation
not
the
most
drinkabel
with
the
off
flavors
d
this
is
pretty
descent
it
works
in
a
pinch
at
a
family
gathering
where
people
think
importsgreat
beer
poured
to
a
light
yellow
and
nice
head
had
a
little
lacing
but
not
a
lot
there
was
some
head
at
the
end
of
the
glass
head
was
slightly
off
white
in
color
smelled
a
little
bit
of
skunk
similar
to
heineken
but
not
as
strong
im
not
saying
thats
a
bad
thing
taste
reminded
me
of
a
watered
down
version
of
heineken
i
liked
it
the
more
i
drank
the
more
i
liked
the
taste
felt
ok
in
the
mouth
carbonation
was
about
right
i
could
drink
these
but
i
dont
think
i
could
make
it
a
session
beer
color
is
rather
typical
of
a
lager
a
clear
strawyellow
aroma
is
malty
and
full
with
more
malt
scent
than
alcohol
bite
flavor
is
ok
but
a
bit
thin
malty
with
a
touch
of
metallic
taste
and
some
bitterness
not
bad
but
a
bit
of
a
disappointment
for
a
german
beer
aftertaste
is
a
little
bitter
and
metallic
wouldnt
recommend
this
one
poured
into
an
oversized
wine
glass
yielding
a
good
fingers
worth
of
white
head
that
fades
quickly
and
leaves
no
lacing
light
golden
color
that
is
crystal
clear
got
scents
of
straw
and
grasses
first
sip
i
tasted
mildly
sweet
honey
and
some
grains
and
ended
with
very
small
amount
of
hop
bitterness
extremely
drinkable
beer
as
i
could
probably
finish
off
three
or
more
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
i
really
cant
taste
anything
except
for
sourness
very
light
hops
very
little
malt
stale
bread
almost
tastes
like
onions
i
really
hated
this
beer
not
much
else
to
say
maybe
i
got
a
bad
batch
i
recommend
this
beer
when
looking
for
something
to
get
sauced
off
thats
a
little
different
but
its
definately
no
treat
or
anything
for
a
special
occasion
nothing
special
here
but
not
offensive
overall
i
found
a
bottle
of
this
hard
to
finish
i
wont
be
back
d
not
too
drinkable
beer
not
too
good
of
a
taste
at
all
for
me
and
the
mouthfeel
was
nonexistent
i
would
recommend
that
you
pass
this
beer
over
when
you
see
it
in
the
store
unless
you
want
something
thats
cheap
to
try
thick
white
foam
on
a
medium
golden
body
st
pauli
girl
starts
and
ends
in
fairly
basic
fashion
the
nose
is
somewhat
pungent
and
mildy
offensive
with
its
greenbottle
skunkiness
damping
down
the
decent
allotment
grassy
hops
having
written
a
few
brief
diatribes
on
this
and
uttered
more
toward
such
beers
i
cant
say
im
surprised
the
taste
makes
a
fairly
decent
recovery
with
the
hops
carrying
the
day
but
the
lack
of
complexity
results
in
a
rather
bitter
imbalanced
beer
moderately
carbonated
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
decent
beer
when
all
is
said
and
done
not
the
worst
not
the
best
but
a
fairly
decent
pilsner
from
germany
this
is
not
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
but
its
not
completely
bad
golden
in
color
with
a
modest
white
head
its
nose
has
a
distinct
yeast
smell
grainy
too
a
drinkable
beer
like
others
have
said
it
has
that
skunky
flavor
but
not
as
strong
as
others
typical
pilsener
taste
which
i
like
bread
and
grain
notes
fair
amount
of
carbonation
good
mouthfeel
a
session
beer
for
some
bottom
line
its
not
a
horrible
beer
but
there
are
better
pilseners
out
there
why
do
any
brewers
still
use
clear
or
green
bottles
it
makes
no
sense
pours
a
generic
lager
gold
color
with
a
pure
white
head
and
tons
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
average
basically
again
generic
lager
aroma
with
slight
corn
hints
as
well
taste
is
pretty
decent
has
a
good
mild
skunkiness
to
it
its
refreshing
and
light
like
a
lager
should
be
its
a
good
lager
and
a
good
go
to
beer
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
light
golden
yellow
color
with
very
short
lasting
white
head
smell
is
yeasty
very
slight
skunkiness
bready
and
light
metallic
which
dissipated
as
it
warmed
and
gave
way
to
a
light
maltiness
taste
is
a
doughy
bready
yeastiness
with
a
good
bit
of
carbonation
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
carlsberg
very
light
and
watery
even
for
the
style
id
think
with
a
very
slight
bitterness
nothing
special
at
all
really
and
i
probably
wouldnt
want
more
than
1
of
these
ever
poured
pale
yellow
in
color
not
much
of
a
head
smell
a
little
hops
not
much
else
taste
a
little
sweetness
up
front
hops
in
the
finish
which
disapeared
quickly
mouthfell
was
light
in
body
mediem
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
ill
take
another
good
german
beer
with
a
great
label
d
nondescript
beer
could
do
worse
could
do
a
whole
lot
better
i
poured
this
and
it
came
out
a
light
gold
with
little
carbonation
and
no
head
it
smelled
like
sweet
corn
and
tastes
sweeter
than
expected
theres
a
little
bit
of
a
hoppy
grassiness
but
not
enough
to
really
stand
out
it
seems
that
st
pauli
is
just
another
run
of
the
mill
european
lager
id
pass
next
time
d
definitely
a
better
choice
than
most
widely
available
pale
lagers
this
in
all
around
good
pils
you
can
find
it
at
any
gas
station
convenience
store
and
thats
a
good
thing
d
decent
i
could
do
1
or
2
without
getting
bored
fairly
forgettable
but
certainly
not
bad
worth
trying
drinkability
a
very
consumable
classic
european
brew
seems
to
have
lost
something
over
the
years
though
pale
clear
yellow
with
a
better
than
expected
head
that
stayed
for
a
while
it
smelled
pretty
skunky
it
wasnt
pleasant
it
had
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
wasnt
really
the
good
kind
of
flavor
left
my
mouth
dry
i
wont
buy
this
again
soon
but
i
wouldnt
turn
a
free
one
down
a
pretty
decent
brew
here
when
considering
the
style
green
bottle
and
import
status
from
my
experience
this
is
less
likely
to
be
skunked
than
many
of
its
european
counterparts
a
decent
beer
with
good
flavor
light
bodied
fizzy
and
generally
tastes
better
than
most
american
macros
very
drinkable
for
a
pilsner
however
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
buy
often
because
of
how
easy
it
is
to
drink
with
certain
beer
snobs
as
well
as
those
who
dont
usually
drink
anything
though
it
might
not
be
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
i
am
quite
fond
of
this
one
because
its
just
nice
to
drink
poured
from
the
green
bottle
a
good
almost
2
finger
head
but
the
head
was
loose
and
weak
not
thick
and
tight
head
was
gone
by
the
time
i
put
the
bottle
away
and
came
back
no
lacing
pale
yellow
in
color
smell
was
faint
grain
and
malt
surprisingly
no
skunky
the
green
bottles
were
boxed
which
would
keep
the
sunlight
out
that
must
have
helped
taste
had
a
hint
of
mild
malt
and
was
somewhat
floral
faint
grains
detected
as
well
leaves
the
mouth
dry
but
not
cotton
mouth
average
to
above
average
carbonation
in
this
batch
went
down
rather
easily
and
i
was
surprized
it
wasnt
skunky
keeping
sunlight
off
the
bottles
changed
the
way
this
one
smelled
and
tasted
i
was
pleasantly
surprized
that
i
actually
enjoyed
it
this
time
and
i
based
my
review
on
that
not
how
it
normally
is
hey
the
girl
on
the
front
had
long
blonde
hair
that
went
to
where
her
breasts
about
start
i
always
thought
she
had
it
pulled
up
and
she
looks
younger
kinda
nice
why
session
this
when
you
could
session
pbr
pours
a
pale
blond
color
with
a
head
that
doesnt
last
smells
somewhat
skunky
at
first
but
i
can
smell
the
malt
as
well
taste
is
very
bready
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
and
not
much
of
a
flavor
inbetween
average
at
best
but
nothing
special
and
nothing
id
buy
again
since
this
is
often
the
best
choice
on
lame
beer
menus
or
lame
grocery
store
selections
its
not
entirely
without
its
place
in
beerworld
but
its
nothing
id
ever
seek
out
and
depending
on
mood
i
can
see
passing
this
up
in
favor
of
no
beer
at
all
in
a
pinch
it
can
be
enjoyed
otherwise
nah
i
used
to
drink
this
when
i
was
young
and
along
with
dab
warsteiner
paulaner
the
girl
had
a
special
place
going
on
memory
except
for
a
recent
6
of
warsteiner
the
girl
is
the
cheapest
closest
thing
to
a
munchen
beerhall
lager
readily
available
if
there
were
12er
cans
it
would
be
my
goto
macro
along
with
pilsner
urquell
missing
the
foil
over
the
cap
that
i
always
grew
to
appreciate
however
the
top
label
is
still
foil
smell
is
characteristic
for
a
pilsner
sweet
but
reserved
the
taste
is
also
sweet
and
dry
with
a
very
slight
semibitter
hopping
classic
of
a
german
brew
of
this
style
carbonation
is
good
not
too
much
not
too
little
this
beer
has
a
good
yet
not
overwhelming
flavor
and
be
dranken
with
just
about
any
food
anytime
the
ac
is
good
for
flavor
but
not
too
high
allowing
this
beer
to
continue
to
refresh
average
again
not
my
preferred
style
of
beer
as
im
more
of
an
ale
man
no
distinctive
flavor
better
than
american
macrobrews
skunky
aroma
why
the
green
bottles
poured
golden
with
head
that
dissipated
pretty
quickly
mouthfeel
was
thin
would
have
again
if
free
d
this
beer
while
not
amazingly
complex
is
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
its
very
light
and
easy
to
drink
while
having
an
excellent
taste
that
keeps
me
from
being
bored
after
drinking
a
few
since
i
like
this
beer
i
can
drink
it
like
water
my
go
to
cheap
hot
drink
a
lot
brew
it
never
lets
me
down
while
i
recognize
that
i
drank
their
koolaide
its
pretty
good
indeed
some
girls
are
unforgettable
the
color
was
not
bad
pouring
a
hazy
light
gold
with
a
quickly
dissolving
head
their
is
a
hint
of
skunky
smell
mixed
with
maltiness
the
malty
taste
is
predominant
in
this
brew
it
is
a
bit
dry
and
bitter
going
down
this
is
not
something
i
will
probably
ever
drink
again
overlying
skunkiness
and
not
a
lot
of
flavor
excepting
some
bitterness
at
the
very
back
of
the
tongue
looks
like
apple
juice
tastes
like
a
bolder
heineken
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
one
again
really
never
had
a
great
beer
out
of
green
glass
yet
this
beer
holds
a
special
place
in
my
heart
it
was
the
first
beer
i
ever
had
when
i
was
15
years
old
nothing
much
to
reccomend
this
beer
overall
it
is
just
another
below
average
euro
lager
pass
on
this
one
thoughts
if
i
take
everything
into
consideration
price
rarity
type
of
beer
etc
i
think
this
is
pretty
decent
especially
if
you
are
looking
for
a
summer
beer
and
dont
want
to
follow
the
crowd
and
start
stuffing
citrus
fruit
into
clear
bottled
skunk
ass
beer
give
this
one
a
shot
while
on
the
boat
or
the
beach
just
goes
to
show
reinheitsgebot
is
no
guarantee
of
flavor
or
drinkability

a
beer

with
lowenbrau
one
of
germanys
blandest
beers
st
pauli

lager
was
light
golden
in
color
with
good
clarity
it
had
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipated
to
a
thin
ring
before
long
the
aroma
was
light
grain
malt
and
hops
with
a
touch
of
skunk
the
taste
was
light
malt
and
little
grainy
with
some
hops
and
a
dry
finish
it
was
mediumlight
in
body
with
good
carbonantion
overall
it
was
a
decent
beer
that
was
crisp
and
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
and
probably
decently
sessionable
im
just
not
inspired
enough
to
want
more
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
a
pleasant
uncomplicated
beer
an
averageish

not
much
of

like
a
bud
light
or
something
with
that
superpale
watery
yellow
and
a
fizzy
head
that
started
to
fade
before
the
beer
was
even
all
the
way
in
the
glass
beer
was
skunked
but
after
that
wafted
off
there
wasnt
a
whole
lot
left
it
tasted
kind
of
like
corn
flakes
oddly
enough
this
was
a
really
lousy
beer
edging
on
a
drain
pour
but
i
managed
to
finish
it
off
this
is
pretty
much
as
average
a
brew
as
you
can
get
no
real
faults
nor
are
there
any
real
redeeming
qualities
either
it
pours
what
youd
expect
a
mild
golden
colour
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
a
moderate
though
pretty
much
nonsticky
head
theres
a
bit
of
sweetness
to
the
smell
but
overall
its
a
bland
mixture
of
malt
and
hop
nothing
else
really
stuck
out
to
me
the
flavour
is
more
of
the
same
its
crisp
and
bubbly
and
easy
drinking
but
thats
about
it
strangely
i
often
find
myself
ordering
this
one
when
i
see
it
on
the
menu
most
often
this
is
because
its
a
slight
saviour
from
the
macro
garbage
that
takes
up
the
rest
of
the
beer
menu
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
at
whatever
establishment
i
happen
to
be
at
as
this
one
isnt
as
common
as
i
remember
it
being
in
the
past
but
it
is
still
found
amongst
as
i
guess
it
should
be
all
the
macro
stuff
and
heineken
becks
bass
etc
when
it
is
on
the
menu
overall
a
terrible
beer
i
tried
this
just
because
i
needed
to
understand
the
antithesis
of
craft
beer
this
is
it
look
no
further
and
avoid
if
all
possible
this
definitely
provides
perspective
and
a
contrast
to
the
usual
fare
of
fine
brews
i
have
grown
accustom
to
light
taste
i
had
to
check
to
make
sure
this
wasnt
a
light
beer
nope
thin
as
water
it
doesnt
offend
but
sure
as
hell
doesnt
impress
vanishes
instantly
on
the
swallow
not
bad
if
all
you
need
is
a
something
to
mindless
quaff
by
the
grill
chalk
this
one
under
the
kissing
your
sister
category
this
is
a
decent
macro
import
that
is
always
on
sale
here
and
is
great
for
warm
weather
drinking
it
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
that
stays
for
awhile
and
leaves
a
thin
sheat
of
lace
down
my
glass
the
smell
is
a
littly
funky
but
not
bad
and
has
a
decent
ammount
of
malt
in
the
nose
as
well
the
taste
is
refreshing
with
its
crisp
bite
good
malt
flavors
and
a
slight
hop
flavor
as
well
this
is
my
macro
import
of
choice
the
beers
as
it
disembarks
the
12ounce
green
bottle
pours
a
transparent
gold
with
a
medium
sized
white
head
that
is
spumous
in
texture
and
the
residual
lace
a
thin
sheet
nose
is
all
malt
sweet
crisp
and
fresh
start
is
quite
sweet
fair
to
middling
malt
presence
the
top
thin
finish
is
moderate
in
acidity
the
hops
meek
and
mild
dry
aftertaste
a
drinkable
if
light
beer
for
this
old
beer
swiller
will
probably
wait
til
they
put
a
new
model
on
the
label
before
i
trouble
myself
with
this
beer
again
overall
st
pauli
does
an
nice
job
with
this
beer
but
it
isnt
anything
spectacular
solid
unoffensive
and
easytodrink
overall
i
like
this
beer
fairly
smooth
good
taste
doesnt
go
down
as
easy
as
some
but
not
bad
overall
good
to
try
something
different
if
your
in
the
mood
for
something
new
overall
not
a
bad
beer
now
and
again
but
wouldnt
drink
it
regularly
maybe
its
great
on
tap
never
had
a
chance
to
try
it
pours
a
very
light
straw
yellow
with
an
inch
head
that
quickly
fades
away
to
the
depths
of
the
glass
lacing
is
pathetic
not
much
to
speak
of
at
all
the
smell
is
of
grain
and
metal
the
taste
is
very
light
and
crisp
with
floral
notes
with
tad
bit
of
herbs
malt
tone
brings
sweetness
to
the
grainy
aftertaste
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
on
those
nice
days
in
the
sun
but
better
pilseners
out
there
still
not
bad
for
1
59
for
a
24oz
this
is
the
best
warm
weather
beer
ive
had
in
a
long
time
so
why
am
i
drinking
it
now
its
rainy
and
nasty
in
spokane
right
now
yesterday
a
tornado
touched
down
2
miles
from
where
i
was
working
and
there
was
so
much
hail
it
looked
like
it
had
snowed
an
inch
if
you
think
a
tornado
is
freakishly
rare
for
spokane
you
are
100
right
ill
have
to
remember
this
when
the
weather
is
warm
and
predictable
enough
to
safely
do
some
outdoor
grilling
this
beer
was
a
nice
surprise
as
id
always
assumed
it
was
just
a
german
heineken
in
that
it
was
made
for
people
who
equated
imported
with
good
and
had
no
actual
taste
in
beer
joey
pours
about
the
palest
yellow
ive
ever
seen
in
a
beer
crystal
clear
carbonation
was
readily
apparent
head
was
large
coarsely
bubbled
and
did
not
last
long
at
all
smell
was
skunky
with
maybe
a
little
grain
peeking
through
thin
watery
fizzy
mouthfeel
little
bit
of
sweet
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
by
slightly
grassy
hop
flavor
the
taste
was
better
than
youd
expect
it
to
be
judging
from
the
smell
however
that
skunky
smell
keeps
this
from
being
very
drinkable
sinkability

this
one
is
heading
for

skunk
hits
the
nose

seems
to
dissipate
when
exposed

a

after

a

thats
about
it
hard
to
believe
back
in
the
late
70s
this
was
what
i
considered
kickass
imported
beer
how
times
have
changed
thank
god
drinkability
is
really
great
even
from
a
slightly
skunked
bottle
this
is
delicious
as
far
as
macroimports
go
this
is
pretty
average
it
poured
a
light
straw
yellow
with
little
head
and
no
lace
the
was
skunky
yet
there
was
a
faint
scent
of
hops
i
tasted
a
slight
hop
taste
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
it
was
kind
of
watered
down
for
me
but
it
was
a
little
better
than
becks
or
heineken
it
went
down
pretty
smooth
i
think
the
pin
up
girl
ws
the
best
part
of
the
whole
experience
pale
fizzy
yellow
colors
tight
bubbly
white

faded
fast
it
looks
like
what
most
pilseners
i
have
had
looks
like
moderatly
refreshing
smell
some
fresh
saaz
hop
presence
grainy
fresh
cut
grass
and
buttered
corn
on
the
taste
grain
tastes
were
more
mushy
toward
the
finish
not
alot
of
crispness
to
the
flavors
is
what
i
am
trying
to
describe
tight
carbonation
grainyness
is
not
overwhelming
no
skunked
qualities
that
are
associated
with
green
bottled
beers
certainly
more
tasty
and
refreshing
than
other
european
green
bottled
lagers
might
be
worth
a
look
under
desparate
circumstances
pretty

id
choose
over
the
girl
but
she
is
a
solid
brew
that
id
buy
again
goes
well
with
the
sexy
posters
i
was
anything
but
impressed
with
anything
regarding
this
beer
the
head
was
medium
sized
frothy
and
white
and
contained
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
was
clear
lightly
carbonated
with
a
pale
yellow
hue
the
nose
was
slightly
hoppy
and
skunky
with
a
slightly
bitter
and
acidic
flavor
that
left
a
lingering
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
a
little
tingly
and
medium
bodied
there
was
virtually
no
lacing
with
this
beer
a
reasonable
example
of
macrobrewed
german
pilsner
for
the
masses
as
opposed
to
smaller
regional
brews
of
the
fine
crafty
northern
german
pilsners
light
gold
color
small
white

12
oz
bottle
poured
a
typical
pale
yellow
with
not
much
head
and
no
visible
lacing
aroma
was
slightly
skunky
and
that
is
about
all
taste
is
slightly
sweet
and
hoppy
but
watery
thin
much
like
any
typical
macro
you
could
drink
alot
of
these
not
to
bad
but
not
what
i
really
like
nice
head
and
lace
rich
golden
color
aroma
of
hops
permeates
the
immediate
area
quickly
after
pour
hop
presence
in
taste
dominates
but
is
not
overpowering
hop
flavor
bites
on
the
tip
of
the
tongue
and
lingers
there
as
an
aftertaste
not
a
session
beer
for
me
but
definitely
a
beer
i
would
return
to
occasionally
as
i
have
said
this
is
less
offensive
than
becks
and
is
quite
thirst
quenching
not
great
by
any
means
but
for
a
macroimport
this
is
a
reasonable
thirstquencher
john
not
a
standout
by
any
means
and
im
sure
all
that
needs
to
be
said
has
been
said
by
others
crisp
golden
color
with
a
head
that
seems
to
disintegrate
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
weak
aromas
wet
grass
clippings
and
grain
maybe
starts
a
little
maltysweet
with
a
very
thin
grain
taste
and
finishes
with
hops
that
are
more
like
that
taste
you
get
when
you
roll
around
in
the
hay
or
grass
for
a
while
than
truly
bitter
or
balancing
since
its
a
little
weak
upfront
i
guess
that
its
ok
that
its
a
little
weak
in
the
finish
as
well
pretty
thin
but
hey
it
works
right
this
beer
pours
a
bright
yellow
color
with
very
little
head
the
aroma
was
very
skunky
to
me
this
is
how
most
german
pils
smell
to
me
very
similar
to
heineken
maybe
i
just
got
a
skunky
one
who
knows
the
taste
was
a
little
sweet
and
pretty
hoppy
the
taste
isnt
as
skunky
as
the
aroma
leads
you
to
think
surprisingly
unskunky
taste
this
is
a
fairly
smooth
drink
but
not
too
much
to
my
liking
much
like
the
heineken
im
not
too
fond
of
it
just
because
i
dont
like
the
taste
but
i
cant
find
anything
more
specific
than
that
to
describe
it
with
i
would
easily
drink
this
if
i
had
few
options
but
i
prefer
others
sampled
from
a
fresh
24
oz
bottle
directly
out
of
a
sealed
case
not
skunked
an
absolutely
crystal
clear
strawgold
body
is
capped
by
a
creamy
brightwhite
head
of
foam
the
head
retention
is
fairly
good
but
it
eventually
drops
to
just
a
creamy
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
thin
lacing
however
is
left
throughout
most
of
the
glass
the
nose
is
limited
but
displays
a
light
touch
of
herbalspicy
hops
amidst
sweet
malt
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
its
mildly
crisp
and
then
lightly
creamy
and
smooth
across
the
palate
the
flavor
displays
a
low
level
hop
flavor
and
underlying
bitterness
thats
tightly
woven
within
a
softly
sweet
malt
its
so
well
intertwined
in
fact
that
the
beer
seems
almost
onesided
of
course
that
does
lend
somewhat
to
a
give
me
more
drinkability
it
appears
to
include
andjunct
but
the
bottle
label
clearly
states
that
its
brewed
in
strict
accordance
with
the
german
purity
law
of
1516
if
thats
actually
true
im
sure
they
must
be
using
a
good
deal
of
highly
undermodified
chit
malt
as
the
flavor
seems
lacking
in
any
real
grainy
character
it
finishes
dry
with
a
subtle
lingering
note
of
sweet
malt
thats
eventually
backed
up
by
a
low
bitterness
as
much
as
its
not
a
great
beer
from
germany
its
still
a
pretty
decent
europeanstyle
lager
its
clean
and
exceptionally
well
balanced
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
slightly
thin
drinkability
is
ok
as
long
as
i
have
no
other
options
how
did
i
drink
so
much
of
this
in
high
school
pale
yellowstraw
colored
with
a
white
head
of
highly
carbonated
bubbles
the
head
runs
away
quicly
but
leaves
a
bit
of
thin
lace
smell
is
pronounced
and
is
full
of
sulfur
and
a
metallic
undertone
i
detect
some
malt
and
some
of
the
bitter
smell
might
be
hops
there
is
malt
in
the
flavor
but
the
sulfur
comes
through
strongly
and
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
tongue
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
there
is
a
distinct
metallic
aftertaste
borderline
ok
not
much
of
a
smell
and
rather
an
average
coloured
beer
with
a
thin
and
unexciting
foam
head
not
much
of
a
taste
rather
than
how
should
it
put
it
average
lager
style
bitterness
and
lackey
presence
of
any
other
again
an
average
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
wont
try
it
again
crystal
clear
yellow
with
an
average
white
head
that
did
not
last
no
lacing
slight
skunk
smell
from
the
light
green
bottle
upon
the
open
the
taste
is
really
very
average
but
has
a
bit
of
breadiness
at
first
that
is
somewhat
intriguing
the
flavor
is
bittered
by
some
fair
hopping
but
this
really
not
an
impressive
beer
the
aftertaste
is
stronger
than
the
thin
watery
body
not
a
good
representative
of
german
lagers
at
least
the
girl
on
the
bottle
was
happy
pours
a
light
almost
clear
golden
color
with
a
large
but
vaporating
head
adjuncts
noted
on
the
nose
some
grassy
hints
lingering
maybe
skunky
the
taste
on
mouthfeel
are
both
quite
thin
a
grassy
and
grainy
combined
taste
and
feel
just
a
light
wheat
aftertaste
smooth
yet
watery
not
the
worst
these
are
drinkable
they
just
thrash
the
palate
quite
a
drinkable
beer
if
you
are
thirsty
pours
out
a
dark
yellow
colour
thin
and
short
lived
head
no
lace
doesnt
even
look
that
good
strange
metallic
nose
flavors
of
strained
grain
and
a
bitter
metallic
aftertaste
dirty
earthy
hops
float
around
and
contrast
with
the
weak
maltiness
rough
mouthfeel
this
isnt
that
good
of
a
beer
imho
although
i
picked
up
absolutely
no
skunkiness
it
would
be
almost
welcome
to
cover
up
some
other
off
flavors
one
of
the
worst
euro
beers
ive
sampled
the
blonde
on
the
label
with
the
big
um
beer
mugs
kind
of
catches
my
eye
though
good
label
bad
beer
rather
pale
straw
color
with
a
small
white
head
and
effervescent
carbonation
minor
lace
poor
head
retention
quite
a
bit
of
skunk
in
the
nose
as
well
as
cracker
malt
and
mild
hops
taste
begins
with
a
sting
of
carbonation
at
the
tip
of
the
tongue
cracker
malt
flavor
is
prominent
followed
by
slightly
bitter
and
lingering
botanical
hops
finish
is
dry
and
clean
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
better
than
expected
a
slightly
better
than
average
example
of
the
style
st
pauli
girl
truly
awful
in
the
traditional
12
ounce
green
bottle
with
a
date
of
1103
marked
somewhere
on
the
back
very
pale
yellow
with
a
big
white
frothy
head
could
not
hide
the
incredible
skunked
aroma
the
aroma
was
also
dominant
in
the
taste
as
well
this
was
a
substantially
below
average
beer
until
about
four
hours
later
when
the
skunk
taste
was
still
there
bad
pours
an
amber
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
with
decent
lacing
this
is
a
german
macro
that
kicks
ass
on
american
macros
taste
is
malty
with
very
modest
hoppiness
you
do
get
the
feeling
that
the
ingredients
have
been
played
out
however
still
a
decent
beer
nice
light
golden
colour
with
extremly
limited
head
slight
skunky
aroma
which
is
most
prominent
on
introduction
to
this
product
the
taste
is
of
the
hops
and
lingering
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
it
has
limited
appeal
but
glad
i
met
it
pours
a
clear
and
pale
straw
color
with
a
thin
and
bubbly
white
head
nose
is
fresh
malts
and
grains
and
is
also
a
bit
bitter
taste
is
a
bit
bland
with
some
malt
sweetness
very
crisp
and
refreshing
just
like
heineken
and
becks
this
is
a
very
average
brew
that
is
nice
on
a
hot
day
not
much
complexity
but
this
is
a
nice
malty
german
lager
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
a
slight
bubbly
carbonation
i
would
only
drink
this
stuff
more
frequently
if
a
beautiful
woman
dressed
as
the
st
pauli
girl
was
serving
it
to
me
pours
a
clear
golden
hue
with
a
medium
head
that
disappears
rapidly
smells
slightly
skunky
with
light
earthy
grains
in
the
background
the
taste
consists
of
semi
sweet
grains
with
a
twang
throughout
and
finishes
with
carb
bite
and
a
light
hoppy
bitter
this
light
bodied
brew
is
drinkable
enough
but
lacks
alot
to
be
desired
in
the
character
department
prosit
conclusion
this
is
a
marketing
phenomenon
not
a
real
beer
if
you
want
to
spend
your
money
wisely
though
simply
look
at
the
magazine
ads
and
then
put
your
dollars
toward
jever
or
better
yet
bitburger
which
is
a
truly
awesome
german
pilsner
in
high
school
i
thought
i
was
upscale
if
i
drank
this
slightly
better
than
heinikan
with
the
same
yellowish
hue
you
can
barely
taste
the
hops
but
there
is
no
bad
aftertaste
this
beer
is
definetly
brewed
with
mass
marketing
in
america
in
mind
good
bier
it
is
similar
to
heineken
but
better
it
has
a
golden
straw
color
to
it
and
a
clear
but
slightly
funky
skunk
smell
to
it
the
taste
is
just
a
step
above
heineken
the
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
is
very
smooth
and
easy
i
really
enjoy
this
beer
a
boobiemans
beer
saint
pauli
girl
is
a
fairly
good
green
bottle
german
beer
that
goes
well
with
food
and
friends
or
all
by
its
self
initial
aroma
of
graininess
but
turns
to
a
fresh
hops
smell
pale
yellow
and
crystal
clear
head
is
fizzy
and
thins
fairly
quickly
taste
is
a
little
grainy
and
a
little
sweet
at
the
start
has
appropriate
dryness
and
crispness
for
style
mildly
lingering
dryness
thinner
feel
but
plenty
of
carbonation
there
are
better
beers
for
style
but
this
is
drinkable
and
i
doubt
ill
turn
it
down
it
offered
a
very
mediocre
beer
as
others
have
mentioned
the
st
pauli
girl
on
the
label
is
nice
but
that
is
about
the
extent
of
this
beers
redeeming
qualities
pours
out
to
a
slightly
darker
golden
color
with
a
bizarre
smell
taste
is
that
of
light
struck
hops
if
fresh
this
can
be
decent
but
with
so
many
other
good
choices
out
there
this
one
isnt
high
on
my
list
it
beats
a
heine
or
a
becks
any
day
it
has
very
drinkable
characteristics
being
light
and
crisp
the
flavor
is
a
bit
bitter
which
may
turn
many
people
away
but
it
is
still
a
decent
brew
allaround
average
beer
there
are
much
better
pilsners
out
there
that
are
less
skunky
i
dont
know
if
they
will
ever
learn
to
do
away
with
the
green
bottles
its
usually
russian
roulette
with
these
pale
yellow
color
with
almost
no
head
toasted
grain
with
a
slight
touch
of
skunk
crisp
sweet
floral
herbal
spicy
flavor
that
is
decently
balanced
between
the
malt
and
hops
with
a
touch
of
skunk
must
be
the
green
bottle
if
it
werent
for
the
skunkiness
this
could
be
a
good
lager
nevertheless
imho
st
pauli
girl
is
better
than
a
heineken
and
a
becks
spicey
and
herbal
hop
character
light
body
finishes
dry
very
pale
straw
color
not
quite
as
good
as
grolsch
but
a
decent
pilsner
nonetheless
clean
and
crisp
appearance
with
moderate
head
light
amberyellow
in
color
fresh
tasting
with
abundance
of
hops
but
nicely
balanced
by
malt
finishes
a
little
weak
not
the
best
of
german
beers
i
dont
drink
this
one
very
much
any
more
actually
new
a
girl
in
college
that
was
a
st
pauli
girl
really
wish
they
would
get
away
from
that
light
straw
hue
w
a
moderate
head
and
typical
pils
clarity
the
grassy
mildly
spicy
saaz
hop
nose
hits
my
nose
at
first
but
the
mild
skunky
mercaptans
detract
from
my
enjoyment
hop
bitterness
is
quite
firm
and
adds
to
the
crispness
of
this
beer
fuller
in
body
than
other
german
pilsners
the
slight
skunked
flavors
compromise
what
would
be
a
pretty
good
pilsner
st
pauli
girl
finishes
soft
clean
a
touch
grainy
and
a
bit
sweet
although
not
a
particularly
great
pilsner
ill
take
this
over
a
heineken
any
day
angela
little
is
still
the
best
st
pauli
girl
in
history
the
color
is
gold
yellow
starts
sweet
on
the
palate
with
some
hop
spiciness
zesty
towards
the
finish
nice
and
light
feel
to
the
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
very
easily
overall
all
i
think
this
is
an
enjoyable
lager
went
well
with
my
cheese
steak
clean
and
crisp
if
in
shape
which
is
not
often
by
my
experience
drank
em
in
the
80s
until
sam
adams
showed
that
cold
fermenters
had
more
flavor
potential
honestly
ive
had
very
few
st
paulis
that
werent
skunked
sometimes
severely
more
or
less
skunked
depending
on
how
old
it
is
and
where
it
has
been
stored
either
way
there
is
that
underlying
overcooked
hop
aroma
and
flavour
not
as
bad
as
some
other
known
skunk
laden
imports
though
in
the
old
days
it
used
to
be
pizza
and
st
pauli
girl
on
fridays
for
lunch
knocked
back
plenty
of
these
still
its
a
respectable
clean
when
its
not
skunky
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
lightly
hopped
with
a
mild
fruitycandy
sweetness
mouthfeel
on
the
thin
side
if
only
the
beer
was
as
attractive
as
the
beergarden
maiden
on
the
bottle
notes
an
okay
brew
even
despite
those
awesomely
cheesy
adverts
and
stigma
on
imported
lager
in
comparison
to
others
of
the
same
style
again
just
beautifully
simple
i
love
this
and
it
is
a
wonder
that
i
dont
drink
it
by
the
case
sometimes
you
lose
sight
and
have
to
go
back
to
some
of
the
best
simple
beers
available
which
are
often
the
best
anywhere
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
appearance
pours
pale
clear
with
large
head
i
dont
normally
drink
pilsner
so
this
may
be
standard
doesnt
appear
to
be
much
carbonation
head
is
frothy
and
white
aroma
smells
of
wheat
taste
not
sure
if
i
havent
had
a
beer
for
a
along
time
but
initial
thoughts
are
that
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
very
mild
tasting
refreshing
easy
beer
to
drink
wheaty
taste
mouthfeel
some
carbonation
not
overwhelming
it
complements
the
beer
if
anything
overall
really
liked
this
beer
one
of
the
better
cool
fermented
beers
i
have
had
i
was
psyched
to
find
a
bottle
of
this
in
my
area
but
will
be
looking
to
try
this
again
if
i
can
find
a
fresher
bottle
feel
semisweet
and
clear

mild

7
i
had
this
beer
in
germany
and
just
loved
it
grassy
snappy
light
to
medium
body
very
very
good
german
pilsner
looks
good
cant
smell
feels
good
typical
looking
bubbling
pilsner
thin
head
white
lacing
tastes
like
barley
like
eating
barley
tastes
like
a
michelob
lager
for
some
reason
or
an
amstel
heavy
this
is
sooo
delicious
probably
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
ever
had
texcellent
taste
of
noble
hop
and
grass
following
nose
gets
better
the
warmer
it
gets
and
half
way
thru
no
euro
skunk
at
all
fresher
bottle
would
have
been
optimal
but
this
is
hard
to
find
color
is
straw
golden
and
perfectly
clear
pours
one
finger
worth
of
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
subtle
but
consists
of
a
little
floral
hop
spiciness
and
a
sweet
dry
malt
taste
is
along
the
same
lines
with
mildly
nutty
pilsner
malts
upfront
followed
by
a
crisp
spicyherbal
hop
bite
that
follows
to
the
finish
neither
the
hop
or
malt
really
overtake
each
other
yet
both
are
showcased
very
well
and
are
very
complimentary
of
each
other
the
feel
is
pretty
dry
but
theres
enough
malt
to
add
some
smoothness
to
the
finish
light
to
medium
bodied
medium
to
high
carbonation
and
perfectly
clean
in
the
finish
just
a
great
beer
all
round
with
great
flavor
and
balance
and
the
perfectly
crispclean
feel
that
you
want
from
a
pilsner
possibly
the
best
pilsner
ever
o
when
i
tasted
the
first
bottle
of
this
pils
it
really
reminded
me
of
sns
summerfest
pilsner
points
to
sn
the
more
you
drink
of
the
weihen
the
more
you
can
taste
the
malt
hop
and
yeast
character
differences
between
it
and
the
sn
pils
this
makes
me
wonder
again
about
pasteurization
and
also
the
use
of
u
s
2
row
overall
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
pilsner
if
you
want
to
taste
a
good
example
overall
a
typically
goodquality
traditional
beer
from
weihenstephan
brewery
while
pilsner
isnt
one
of
my
favourite
styles
this
is
a
good
example
decent
for
au70
a
case
too
this
has
to
be
one
of
my
favourites
all
around
and
in
my
opinion
almost
on
par
with
the
hefe
from
this
brewery
and
the
best
pilsner
i
ever
tasted
with
konig
a
not
so
far
second
i
really
love
it
taste
is
nice
juicy
herb
grain
lemonapple
with
lean
bread
and
firm
zesty
bitterness
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
beers
in
the
style
medium
light
body
and
medium
high
carbonation
overall
so
this
is
what
a
pilsner
is
supposed
to
taste
like
this
lager
is
the
yardstick
which
other
pilsners
should
be
compared
to
its
a
shame
the
megaamerican
breweries
choose
not
to
make
beers
that
taste
like
this
great
example
of
how
german
and
czech
style
lagers
at
their
best
can
compete
with
nearly
any
ale
crisp
and
refreshing
yet
complex
in
its
malthop
balance
this
is
a
true
classic
very
good
german
pilsner
pours
a
slightly
cloudy
dark
straw
color
with
a
foamy
inch
head
that
remains
for
a
little
bit
before
dissipating
to
just
a
bubbly
layer
some
lacing
left
along
the
glass
as
you
finish
smell
is
malty
with
some
direct
yeastbread
notes
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
german
pils
hard
to
go
wrong
with
this
one
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
nice
dry
finish
overall
really
fine
german
pils
these
guys
cant
do
anything
wrong
overall
drinkability
a
full
flavor
pilsener
but
perhaps
just
above
average
although
high
marks
for
appearance
however
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
like
many
german
pilseners
ive
had
i
feel
this
one
is
engineered
to
be
drank
in
high
quantities
and
go
with
a
wide
range
of
food
which
in
this
case
was
pizza
i
could
easily
have
another
one
as
everything
together
works
well
and
it
complimentsaccents
food
but
doesnt
get
in
the
way
o
yawn
this
is
ones
a
classic
always
nice
to
step
back
from
the
crazy
brews
once
in
a
while
and
respect
something
more
subtle
but
not
any
less
complex
a
very
well
done
pilsner
though
i
would
love
a
chance
to
try
a
more
fresh
version
of
this
overall
such
a
refreshing
beer
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
here
in
boston
more
please
hard
pressed
to
find
a
more
authentic
and
more
satisfying
lager
weihenstephaner
seems
unable
to
make
anything
short
of
stellar
overall
a
tasty
classic
pils
what
really
makes
this
beer
world
class
is
the
almost
unbelievable
creamy
mouthfeel
that
it
manages
to
produce
with
this
style
of
beer
a
good
almost
great
southern
german
pilsner
with
interesting
hops
carbonation
is
a
bit
too
sharp
for
my
taste
mouthfeel
is
light
effervescent

i
like

a
i
have
had

nothing

with
a

once
in

overall
this
is
a
shithot
beer
so
well
crafted
plenty
of
character
but
drinkable
and
refreshing
as
hell
if
i
ever
feel
myself
doubting
the
greatness
that
can
be
exhibited
by
a
pale
lager
ill
revisit
this
one
right
here
superb
stuff
o
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
another
winner
from
weihenstephaner
other
this
pils
is
different
from
ones
from
other
german
regions
north
german
pilsners
taste
a
bit
earthy
i
find
southwest
german
pilsners
use
much
more
assertive
flavoring
hops
this
one
a
bavarian
pils
tastes
a
bit
more
like
a
czech
one
too
me
probably
due
to
its
proximity
and
overall
historic
influence
in
the
previously
germanspeaking
areas
of
the
czech
republic
where
the
pilsner
style
was
invented
t
very
balanced
indeed
crisper
and
cleaner
than
the
nose
let
on
with
the
sugar
scent
the
malt
is
very
well
done
a
perfect
example
of
the
style
just
a
hint
of
pine
its
obvious
noble
hops
were
used
in
this
baby
and
the
light
earthy
pine
is
very
nicely
blended
in
this
brew
brilliant
straw
yellow
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
a
short
bright
white
foam
that
was
constantly
reinforced
by
a
stream
of
carbonation
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
white
foam
barely
faltered
as
it
left
sheets
of
sticky
lacing
on
the
glass
lemon
and
earthy
grass
aromas
up
front
with
biscuit
malt
deep
beneath
medium
bodied
with
rich
aggressive
carbonation
and
a
lightly
crisp
finish
biscuit
malt
and
herbal
hop
flavors
from
beginning
to
end
light
peppery
flavor
ramps
up
through
the
middle
to
the
end
finishes
crisply
with
biscuit
malt
and
hop
bitter
aftertaste
aroma
feel
and
flavors
are
all
very
delicate
a
pleasant
refreshing
easy
drinking
lager
o
my
second
beer
from
weihenstephaner
and
i
cant
wait
for
the
third
this
beer
is
significantly
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
and
i
think
reviewing
each
alone
does
this
beer
a
disservice
enjoy
on
a
warm
summer
day
as
i
did
remarks
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
still
a
style
i
struggle
with
sometimes
but
this
was
pretty
darn
good
the
sulfurous
aromas
and
flavors
that
accompany
so
many
pilseners
and
acceptable
for
style
i
find
somewhat
offputting
but
its
fairly
mild
here
and
seems
more
integrated
into
the
other
aspects
certainly
recommended
for
someone
looking
for
a
good
pilsener
o
a
solid
german
pils
with
some
nice
noble
hop
character
that
provides
a
light
bitterness
easy
to
drink
and
flavorful
enough
to
be
quaffable
a
little
simple
but
thats
nothing
too
serious
o
a
bit
disappointing
for
me
it
fits
the
style
fine
but
almost
too
bitter
and
yeast
driven
even
for
me
lightbodied
with

it
remains
lively
and
is
pretty

overall
as
well
it
goes
into
a
dry

thats
still
smooth
this
is
the
first
time
ive
seen
this
beer
sold
in
northern
virginia
and
im
very
glad
i
found
it
as
it
is
on
of
the
very
best
pilsners
ive
ever
had
i
put
this
in
the
same
class
as
stoudts
pilsner
and
victory
prima

pours
a
clear

very

here
nothing
icky
to
speak
of
even
after
it
warms
i
get
a
lot
of
grassiness
and
sweeter
notes
of
honey
and
cereal
grains
on
the
palate
this
beer
is
very
lively
and
electric
the
aromas
carry
over
perfectly
to
the
front
and
midpalate
where
they
are
in
perfect
balance
before
finishing
on
a
refreshingly
dry
and
almost
tart
i
enjoyed
having
it
with
an
assortment
of
cheeses
and
berries
an
excellent
choice
as
the
weather
warms

i
am
a
great
fan
of
weihenstephaner
hefe
weissbier
so
i
decided
to
get
a
single
of
their
pils
the
taste
is
sort
of
reminiscent
of
that
beer
at
first
sample
it
is
a
solid
beer
in
my
mind
not
the
definitive
pilsner
but
solid
beer
none
the
less
i
am
glad
i
only
got
a
single
as
it
was
not
that
interesting
to
keep
my
interest
i
was
pretty
excited
to
find
a
bottle
from
weihenstephaner
thats
new
to
me
and
its
even
better
that
this
is
quite
a
nice
pilsner
it
pours
pale
yellow
a
bright
hay
color
quite
clear
a
big
white
head
puffed
up
immediately
and
held
its
shape
a
good
few
inches
over
the
top
of
the
glass
lots
of
bubbles
sticking
to
the
walls
of
the
glass
and
such
aroma
is
a
mix
of
very
fresh
grain
with
some
bright
spicy
hops
the
hops
are
a
bit
milder
than
id
like
but
their
aroma
is
nice
pleasant
lightly
tart
flavor
from
the
lager
yeast
malt
is
light
and
sweet
taste
has
more
of
that
light
yeasty
tartness
pretty
crisp
theres
some
more
of
that
quality
pilsner
malt
sweetness
but
the
beer
is
fairly
dry
particularly
in
the
finish
hops
are
spicy
grassy
and
floral
mouthfeel
is
mildly
tart
and
very
clean
weihenstephaner
definitely
shows
off
their
technical
skill
with
this
beer
it
just
nails
the
classic
pilsner
flavors
its
tasty
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
theres
no
off
flavors
to
be
found
this
beer
is
pretty
much
what
i
wish
macro
lagers
tasted
like
so
this
is
how
a
pilsner
is
supposed
to
taste
huh
this
beer
was
pretty
damn
good
but
thats
typically
to
be
expected
from
weihenstephan
so
clean
raw
pure
and
nearly
perfect
within
its
element
this
would
be
great
to
pound
while
outside
on
a
hot
summer
day
easy
to
drink
and
easy
to
come
around
to
a
benchmark
for
the
style
this
reminded
me
of
drinking
beers
at
the
hoffbrau
house
its
ok
not
like
omfg
what
a
great
beer
if
you
had
a
giant
pretzel
and
had
some
hot
big
racked
frau
serving
you
a
2l
stien
you
would
be
damnnn
i
like
this
not
bad
not
great
satisfying
ok
ehhh
ill
have
anutha
thats
2for2
for
me
on
weihenstephaners
just
a
good
pilsner
o
i
feel
that
pilsners
when
theyre
done
well
provide
a
great
example
of
simple
refreshment
in
lieu
of
water
this
is
one
i
feel
that
stacks
up
nicely
it
strikes
a
middle
ground
between
the
intensity
of
prima
pils
and
the
delicacy
of
pilsner
urquell
pleasing
clean
and
refreshing
weihenstephaner
pilsner
is
simple
yet
is
tasty
putting
out
pleasant
grassy
notes
and
pleasnt
hop
bitterness
backed
by
a
honeysuckle
and
biscuit
base
the
beer
is
light
bodied
with
modest
crispness
and
is
a
simple
pleasure
to
drink
another
one
among
many
excellent
choices
from
weihenstephaner
o
a
solid
pilsner
but
nothing
outstanding
o
a
solid
pils
and
what
i
can
find
from
the
internets
its
fairly
fresh
first
time
ive
seen
it
in
the
southland
worth
a
pickup
but
the
regular
helles
lager
from
these
guys
is
the
superior
brew
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
on
top
of
the
beer
a
foamy
latticework
of
lace
coats
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
some
herbal
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
tasty
and
very
easy
to
drink
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
enjoyable
because
of
the
moderate
bitterness
combined
with
the
lighter
body
and
bready
malts
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
solid
pilsener
beer
that
delivers
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
it
really
stands
out
given
the
lightbodied
nature
of
this
beer
and
is
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
perfect
choice
to
open
up
your
palate
with
before
a
meal
having
been
shut
out
of
this
beer
due
to
the
awesome
distribution
network
outside
of
cook
county
i
was
glad
to
see
it
on
tap
it
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
light
biscuit
light
wheat
sweet
flowers
and
a
kiss
of
coriander
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
sort
of
streamwater
character
that
goes
very
nicely
with
everything
else
this
is
what
a
pilsner
tastes
like
son
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
damn
solid
pils
no
surprise
considering
the
source
great
german
pils
malt
and
bitterness
balance
wonderfully
more
than
solid
and
very
worthy
othis
isnt
terrible
but
besides
the
bitterness
it
has
an
adjunct
quality
to
it
definitely
one
of
the
hoppiest
planets
ive
ever
had
i
recommend
others
to
at
least
give
this
a
try
body
is
mediumlight
to
light
in
weight
with
lively
yet
not
prickly
carbonation
the
resultant
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and

finish
is
dry
drinkability
is
pretty
high
this
is
a
text

pils
a
bit
more
bittering
than
usual
gives
it
a
nice
earthy
backbone

its

the

and
worth
a
pick
up
perhaps
expected
a

out
of
it
due
to
it
being
a
weihenstephaner
product
but
it
will
stand
up
to
most
pilsners
out
there
overall
perhaps
not
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
o
not
the
best
in
the
weihenstaphan
lineup
but
not
bad
feels
a
little
undercarbonated
overall
fairly
good
starts
off
really
well
but
gets
a
little
too
much
overall
on
the
flavor
a
little
too
bitter
but
full
of
flavor
and
drinkable
a
little
more
crisp
and
clean
on
the
finish
would
have
made
it
a
bit
better
but
otherwise
a
pretty
good

and
i
wouldnt
expect
less
from
weihenstephaner
o
overall
another
good
beer
from
weihenstephaner
not
my
favorite
style
but
a
good
example
of
it
and
a
very

that
holds

and
above
all
is
highly
drinkable
now
if
the
only
the
german
bars
in
town
would
put
this
on
draft
o
pretty
plain
but
its
drinkable
at
least
has
an
odd
sort
of

that
i
cant
quite
place
my

weihenstephaner
just
knows
how
to
nail
a

style
overall
this
was
a
good
beer
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
a
wonderful
dense
pilsner
and
i
like
its
balance
of
sweetness
hop
and
dense
malt
i
rarely
ever
see
this
beer
here
and
i
wish
it
would
show
up
more
often
its
fantastic
it
might
even
be
my
favorite
from
the
brewery
o
love
the
hefeweisen
from
these
guys
and
this
is
another
good
example
of
a
traditional
style
there
have
been
quite
a
few
fantastic
beers
bearing
the
name
weihenstephaner
over
the
years
pilsner
isnt
quite
fantastic
but
it
is
pretty
darn
good
its
a
classic
german
pilsner
that
features
all
the
hallmarks
of
the
style
if
youre
in
the
market
for
a
good
german
pilsner
dont
overlook
this
one
a
really
nice
pils
dry
and
grassy
some
light
grain
and
sulfur
notes
but
other
than
that
really
spot
on
no
off
flavors
and
super
clean
tasting
great
pilsner
beer
o
avery
fine
pilsner
in
every
regard
highly
recommend
for
lager
and
pilsner
lovers
notes
solid
top
to
bottom
very
tasty
cheers
a
nice
balanced
pilsner
flavor
with
good
fruit
and
hop
notes
weihenstephaner
seems
like
the
sierra

of
germany
hazy
golden
color
that
clears
up
as
the
head
settles
white
foam
good
size
and
stick
nose
is
grassy
with
a
good
dose
of
lemongrass
hopping
munich
malt
mingles
with
the
pale
flavor
is
fairly
assertive
for
style
and
there
is
a
decent
finish
of
malt
and
hops
that
is
actual
beer
ingredients
other
pilsners
take
note
this
is
a
german
pils
with
some
attitude
nice
citric
note
in
the
middle
for
complexity
raises
my
score
a
hair
food
match
would
go
well
with
seafood
calamari
crayfish
atlantic
trout
or
salmon
or
grilled
beef
cuts
rump
tbone
or
eye
fillets
are
good
or
if
you
cant
decide
surf
and
turf
it
vegetarian
option
would
be
panfried
portobello
mushrooms
with
a
mesclun
vinaigrette
salad
o
pleasant
and
drinkable
nothing
wrong
with
this
lager
wellcrafted
as
youd
expect
from
the
weihenstaphan
brewery
o
its
a
good
beer
there
is
nothing
exceptional
about
it
but
its
worth
a
try
m
it
is
a
refreshing
tasting
but
in
general
a
little
too
bitter
at
some
point
it
is
balanced
with
some
bittersweetness
the
ending
is
good
a
little
dry
on
the
back
o
very
honest
german
pilsener
weihenstephaner
quality
recommended
not
my
favorite
from
them
by
a
long
shot
but
still
pretty
tasty
overall
this
is
fantastic
if
you
love
your
pilsners
you
will
love
this
beer
i
could
easily
see
this
as
a
session
beer
the
pilsner
could
be
called
something
like
the
invisible
brew
or
the
like
you
may
sell
almost
no
color
no
smell
and
no
taste
but
surprisingly
the
lack
of
attributes
actually
works
very
well
and
defines
a
classy
pils
of
potent
pureness
brilliant
old
school
pils
these
days
ive
been
drinking
more
along
the
new
world
pils
lines
but
this
is
a
good
reminder
of
how
its
done
laced
very
nicely
nose
is
soft
subtle
and
floral
really
pleasant
brilliantly
flavourful
without
being
overpowering
or
in
your
face
like
a
hot
chick
walking
down
the
street
who
knows
shes
hot
but
she
doesnt
acknowledge
all
the
dudes
staring
at
her
a
really
creamy
mouthfeel
with
moderate
bitterness
a
long
finish
and
the
feeling
that
youve
drunk
a
beer
worth
remembering
overall
my
write
up
is
probably
a
little
harsh
after
being
impressed
by
other
weihenstephan
brews
this
isnt
a
bad
german
pilsner
but
their
are
others
which
have
impressed
me
far
more
i
might
have
enjoyed
this
more
paired
with
a
good
steak
or
maybe
my
palate
just
wasnt
in
the
mood
today
im
willing
to
give
it
another
go
but
im
not
in
any
rush
to
do
so
clean
and
refreshing
this
beer
has
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
classic
pils
in
terms
of
flavour
and
aroma
unfortunately
it
lacks
the
crisp
dryness
that
makes
a
pils
great
not
enjoyable
but
at
least
it
wasnt
the
usual
euro
skunky
lager
this
beer
pours
a
pale
see
thru
honeyish
colour
that
has
decent
carbonation
that
leaves
a
fast
vanishing
one
finger
head
with
average
lacing
it
has
nice
aromas
of
hubba
bubba
grape
bubblegum
filled
noblegrassy
hops
a
very
pleasant
aroma
and
the
taste
is
as
beautiful
as
the
aroma
it
has
a
thin
mouthfeel
to
be
expected
for
the
style
that
is
perfectly
balanced
out
with
the
crisp
fresh
tastes
of
noble
hops
with
a
soft
bubblegum
finishi
really
like
this
beer
and
plan
on
making
it
a
known
face
in
my
collectionin
my
eyes
a
well
known
breweries
hidden
jewel
d
drinkable
as
hell
i
could
drink
this
endlessly
without
even
realizing
i
was
drinking
to
be
honest
its
too
drinkable
for
my
tastes
but
that
is
the
styles
hallmark
most
foods
would
probably
overpower
this
beer
but
it
would
be
interesting
to
try
with
some
milder
flavored
things
such
as
a
spinach
salad
or
a
mild
fish
with
a
fresh
lemon
squeezed
on
it
a
spicy
food
might
also
go
well
with
it
this
brew
is
very
clean
and
a
beautiful
example
of
the
style
there
is
even
a
slight
warming
finish
which
is
odd
with
only
a
moderate
abv
this
pils
deserves
your
serious
attention
taste
is
a
bit
weak
and
watery
again
with
a
bit
of
an
unwelcome
sticky
yeast
a
few
hops
on
the
front
palate
the
finish
is
a
bit
dry
and
bitter
which
is
good
but
the
main
palate
is
not
tasty
enough
to
impress
its
decent
drinking
but
id
expect
more
from
weihenstephaner
could
use
more
bittering
hops
and
aroma
hops
really
just
a
bit
flavourless
and
the
yeast
seeps
through
too
much
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
and
overcarbonated
an
ok
pils
but
not
as
good
as
i
would
expect
from
this
lot
tasted
nice
a
balance
of
lightness
bitterness
and
hops
and
breadiness
slightly
more
distinctive
hop
flavor
than
the
average
pils
solid
overall
not
as
smooth
in
terms
of
carbonation
as
i
expected
but
whatever
good
drinkability
a
good
beer
in
the
style
german
pilsener
not
an
overly
complex
beer
by
any
stretch
but
this
is
a
top
session
beer
at
the
price
and
size
and
availability
in
aus
at
least
it
is
well
worth
a
look
at
had
this
at
a
biergarten
in
lichtefelde
west
in
berlin
i
think
this
is
by
far
one
of
the
best
and
most
unique
german
pils
ive
had
its
not
as
skunky
and
boring
as
a
lot
of
the
german
pils
nothing
like
victory
prima
pils
etc
so
its
a
little
unorthodox
significantly
sweeter
candylike
but
still
with
a
clean
pilsner
taste
that
makes
you
keep
wanting
to
drink
it
pours
a
rather
light
golden
colour
very
clear
has
a
very
thick
creamy
head
that
lasts
quite
a
while
and
laces
the
glass
all
the
way
down
smells
very
citrusy
sweet
and
malty
has
a
very
crisp
taste
with
light
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
nice
bite
to
it
before
it
smooths
out
quite
enjoyable
the
peculiar
characteristic
of
this
beer
is
the
balance
and
cleaning
pleasant
elegant
and
drinkable
remarkable
way
the
votes
have
been
revised
accordingly
2009
edit
okay
many
reviews
i
did
in
0708
were
inaccurate
and
contained
idiotic
statements
due
to
my
lack
of
beer
experience
at
the
time
but
this
is
possibly
the
most
inaccurate
of
them
all
i
have
now
decided
this
is
the
best
german
pilsener
i
have
tried
thanks
to
its
fantastic
balance
and
lack
of
flaws
the
score
has
been
bumped
up
from
3
45
to
4
d
a
pretty
decent
pilsener
tasty
sessionable
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
foamy
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
but
eventually
fades
to
a
thin
layer
smells
slightly
of
noble
hops
with
some
floral
aroma
there
as
well
the
taste
is
clean
with
some
slightly
malty
sweetness
there
but
theres
a
lot
of
noble
hop
flavor
and
enough
bitterness
to
finish
a
little
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
and
creamy
very
nice
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
pilsener
wouldnt
hesitate
to
get
it
again
interesting
that
i
tried
this
one
day
after
pilsner
urquell
pu
is
definitely
the
more
interesting
tastier
pils
but
i
feel
that
this
is
better
quality
and
fresher
price
is
on
the
high
side
but
so
is
the
quality
so
value
is
average
that
said
ive
heard
that
many
weihenstephaner
beers
are
cheaper
than
soft
drink
in
germany
all
i
can
say
is
lucky
bloody
germans
thanks
to
finite
for
sending
this
out
excellent
stuff
excellent
brewery
the
only
drawback
is
that
its
rather
boring
to
look
at
no
head
no
lacing
and
a
rather
common
color
certainly
a
summer
beer
to
drink
to
slake
the
first
but
has
enoughquality
to
savour
d
this
brewery
makes
brilliant
hefeweizen
but
this
beer
is
out
of
that
league
of
brilliance
despite
its
decent
quality
its
just
a
standard
german
lager
in
need
drier
characters
to
mimick
northern
german
lagers
or
more
aromatic
and
hoppier
presence
to
compete
with
its
bohemian
counterpart
or
a
maltier
body
to
immitate
the
bavarian
helles
as
in
itself
nothing
much
stands
out
or
maybe
its
just
my
bias
in
favour
of
czech
pilsner
that
makes
me
think
so
bottle
sparkling
clear
pale
gold
not
much
head
and
what
there
was
didnt
stick
around
although
i
am
suspicious
of
my
glass
sweet
malty
cookie
dough
aroma
with
very
subtle
flowers
from
the
hops
taste
starts
with
the
sweet
malt
then
finishes
lightly
dry
and
bitter
not
being
a
big
hop
head
i
find
it
much
better
balanced
in
this
respect
than
the
few
other
pilsner
styles
tried
so
far
light
slightly
watery
mouthfeel
very
crisp
and
refreshing
like
all
weihenstephaners
it
was
lightly
carbonated
so
you
could
fully
appreciate
the
beer
definitely
a
beer
im
going
to
look
out

this
is
one
of
those
beers
made
in
austin
that
just
fits
with
the
local
climate
and
tastes
kudos
to
abw
o
only
had
the
one
pint
so
all
of
this
is
a
firstblush
look
at
the
brew
but
its
very
very
good
looking
forward
to
trying
many
more
m
you
can
definitely
taste
the
carbonation
which
is
a
little
disappointing
but
definitely
not
something
to
push
you
away
o
overall
another
great
gateway
beer
when
trying
to
convert
a
macro
drinker
i
just
had
the
kelso
pils
a
bit
earlier
tonight
and
that
one
had
a
great
sweetness
that
this
one
is
missing
although
true
to
style
and
leans
towards
the
classic
german
pils
i
find
the
german
pils
to
be
imperfect
for
my
tastes
solid
pils
but
not
something
ill
be
hunting
or
stocking
three
is
how
many
pearl
snap
pils
the
brewery
says
i
can
drink
before
i
start
trying
that
annoying
accent
one
is
how
many
it
took
to
make
me
a
huge
fan
of
theirs
not
only
can
these
guys
evidently
brew
but
theyre
also
extremely
cool
and
clever
marketers
od
a
nice
easy
drinker
on
a
cool
day
not
much
about
it
that
distinguishes
it
from
the
rest
is
well
done
for
the
style
of
course
a
bit
filling
at
times
abv
is
right
in
line
o
very
easy
to
drink
this
works
really
well
as
both
a
warm
weather
lawnmower
beer
and
for
spicy
foods
like
indian
or
mexican
due
to
the
slight
sweetness
and
crispness
slightly
hazy
pale
golden
color
body
very
clean
nose
saaz
is
apparent
i
enjoy
the
bready
flavors
and
the
overall
hoppiness
but
theres
a
toastiness
that
im
just
not
feeling
almost
like
this
was
brewed
by
new
belgium
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
full
solid
this
would
be
a
pretty
solid
goto
beer
if
not
for
the
toastiness
kinda
kills
it
for
me
solid
otherwise
as
a
local
austinite
my
review
seems
relevant
i
have
savored
a
lot
of
local
beers
and
austin
pearl
snap
is
one
of
my
favorites
normally
i
am
a
fan
of
ipas
the
austing
pearl
snap
is
a
great
pils
but
actually
tastes
very
similar
to
an
ipa
please
note
that
i
am
not
a
beer
expert
just
a
regular
beer
customer
poured
on
tap
this
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
smells
are
of
grass
hops
crisp
earthy
tones
some
malts
the
feel
is
medium
to
light
the
taste
is
good
a
nice
bitter
amount
of
noble
hops
along
with
some
clean
earthy
flavors
o
overall
this
isnt
a
bad
german
pilsner
on
the
nose
and
mouth
the
hops
are
a
bit
too
prominent
the
taste
though
the
hops
are
a
bit
faded
wonderful
take
on
a
classic
pilsner
style
lager
best
ive
had
from
texas
saaz
hoppiness
rings
true
and
clear
clean
finish
good
astringency
here
nice
off
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
light
straw
color
and
light
lace
down
the
glass
yum
will
buy
again
is
not
quite
true
to
style
but
excellent
nonetheless
o
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
but
its
not
spectacular
its
a
bit
too
bitter
in
the
finish
for
my
liking
im
pleased
to
have
tried
it
but
i
dont
think
id
seek
this
beer
out
if
it
were
available
in
my
area
this
is
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
light
on
the
stomach
amd
the
mouthfeel
definitely
something
i
could
drink
3
or
4
glasses
of
without
realizing
it
well
balanced
easy
to
drink
d
would
certainly
buy
this
again
not
a
session
pils
as
i
enjoyed
sipping
this
one
one
to
enjoy
thanks

this
in
a
trade
with
a
friend
12
ounce
can
into

glass
no
canning
date
but
i
got
it
recently
pours
almost
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
fairly
dense
white
head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
decent
lacing
clinging
the
glass
and
plenty
of
carbonation
streaming
up
aromas
of
lemon
grass
floral
hops
pepper
herbs
and
a
bit
of
biscuit
nice
aromas
with
good
balance
and
decent
strength
taste
of
big
lemon
biscuit
floral
pepper
herb
grass
and
spiciness
light
floral
bitterness
on
the
finish
with
lingering
notes
of
lemon
biscuit
herb
pepper
and
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
bit
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
crisp
and
very
nice
mouthfeel
that
is
not
thin
at
all
no
alcohol
noticed
at
all
in
the
taste
or
finish
as
expected
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
highly
excellent
pilsener
with
a
ton
of
nice
well
balanced
flavor
one
of
the
best
ones
i
have
had
for
sure
o
all
in
all
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
it
would
go
wonderful
with
a
nice
beach
or
pool
very
good
blend
from
sweet
to
skunk
a
nice
job
and
good
impression
by
austin
beerworks
with
this
one
o
this
one
is
a
winner
its
bang
on
for
the
style
imho
flavorful
and
refreshing
i
wish
the
nose
were
a
bit
more
distinctive
but
its
a
small
complaint
mouthfeel
is
another
feather
in
austin
beerworks
cap
it
is
crisp
and
dry
with
a
light
carbonated
bite
i
am
a
big
fan
of
this
beer
to
me
there
is
nothing
better
then
a
simple
yet
flavorful
beer
combine
the
fact
that
its
canned
and
easy
to
take
with
you
to
the
beach
or
lake
and
you
have
my
new
favorite
summer
beer
overall
a
pretty
good
example
for
the
style
very
happy
to
a
local
austin
brewery
produce
a
quality
craft
brew
lookin
forward
to
trying
the
other
styles
as
well
pours
a
clear
sunny
orange
color
with
a
nice
white
head
lightly
sweet
aroma
of
crackers
and
bread
crust
with
slight
notes
of
citrus
and
floral
hop
notes
slightly
sweeter
bread
notes
on
the
taste
with
a
clean
crisp
light
hop
bite
on
the
finish
floral
and
citrusy
body
is
light
with
a
slight
creamy
texture
smooth
balance
and
excellent
drinkability
definitely
a
refreshing
and
tasty
pils
bread
crust
and
saltine
crackers
shout
the
malt
pine
sap
and
minty
earth
scream
the
hops
eventually
the
louder
of
the
two
parties
mineral
water
and
sulfury
yeastiness
lingers
in
the
finish
this
pilsener
could
hang
with
the
best
of
german
offerings
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
bubbly
lightbodied
dry
on
the
back
end
and
ultimately
drinkable
a
fantastic
pils
to
make
you
fall
in
love
with
the
style
all
over
again
im
quite
happy
that
the
taste
departed
from
the
smell
significantly
this
isnt
a
style
i
often
spring
for
and
i
havent
found
many
american
versions
that
i
enjoy
but
this
is
solid
oh
yea
it
is
about
damn
time
a
texas
brewery
nailed
a
good
pilsner
especially
considering
all
the
german
immigrant
heritage
near
the
hill
country
this
one
can
hang
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
the
pennsylvania
pilsners
snappy
sharp
and
crisp
with
lots
of
hop
flavor
and
character
goes
down
smooth
and
fast
i
am
very
impressed
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
nicesized
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
mix
of
grain
and
grass
with
a
little
bit
of
citrus
mixed
in
a
very
nice
smelling
beer
the
flavor
is
a
mix
of
grain
and
bready
malt
with
some
grassy
and
citrus
hops
mixed
in
i
also
get
a
little
bit
of
toffee
in
the
flavor
the
bitterness
is
pretty
high
for
a
pilsner
but
goes
with
the
flavors
very
well
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
much
like
some
of
the
better
pilsners
up
here
in
lake
country
if
i
lived
in
the
austin
area
i
might
buy
this
regularly
so
if
you
do
live
in
the
austin
area
i
would
advise
giving
this
a
try
cheers
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
this
one
completely
won
me
over
really
digging
abw
offerings
this
is
really
a
good
choice
to
pick
up
hopefully
ill
be
seeing
it
more
of
it
and
other
abw
beers
more
widely
available
in
the
upcoming
weeks
mouthfeel
light
and
snappy
with
a
good
crisp
feeling
o
a
pretty
nice
easy
to
drink
pils
good
flavor
and
aroma
o
definitely
not
what
i
was
expecting
from
a
german
pilsner
or
if
there
was
more
noticeable
malt
flavor
it
feels
good
to
drink
and
is
certainly
refreshing

this
is
easy
drinking
so
if
youre
into
pils
this
is
a
decent
option
nothing
id
leave
the
house
to
acquire
but
totally
preferable
to
the
budweisers
of
the
world
overall
i
did
rather
enjoy
this
pils
its
not
a
brew
id
actively
seek
out
nor
one
that
is
worthy
of
a
world
class
rating
but
decent
and
worth
a
shot
id
take
this
over
a
budweiser
anytime
o
really
good
pilsener

these
pils
arent
doing
a
whole
lot
hoppy
like
a
czechstyle
pils
nothing
spectacular
here
but
drinkable
take
two
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
fizzy
head
it
smells
very
citrusy
and
floral
with
a
slight
undertone
of
grains
the
grains
are
more
pronounced
in
the
flavor
but
are
balanced
nicely
by
the
citrus
and
floral
hops
still
cant
find
a
sweetwater
beer
that
doesnt
taste
like
lake
water
o
ok
for
the
style
but
not
incredible
i
could
not
drink
this
beer
really
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
i
actually
poured
it
out
i
never
pour
a
beer
out
i
just
could
not
drink
it
gross
lol
the
body
is
light
but
almost
fuller
than
expected
with
a
firm
crispness
and
a
smoothness
that
keeps
up
almost
to
the
end
graininess
takes
away
from
the
cleaner
aspects
but
not
exceedingly
mold
of
prima
pils
has
a
strange
flavor
to
it
not
on
board
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
of
grains
and
malts
taste
is
grassy
malts
hops
are
present
bitter
at
the
finish
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
is
a
decent
beer
overall
pretty
easy
drinking
if
you
like
the
type
of
hop
used
i
prefer
a
bit
of
a
heavier
body
more
of
a
malt
focus
this
is
pretty
distinctive
for
a
pils
a
bit
malt
light
though
on
tap
at
sweetwater
taphouse
in
the
atlanta
airport
pours
golden
yellow
as
expected
a
bit
of
haze
and
darker
than
other
in
the
style
with
a
super
creamy
half
finger
head
on
top
aroma
of
plastic
and
dusty
dry
hops
not
much
pils
malt
influence
on
the
aroma
meh
flavor
is
dirty
malts
unpleasant
adjunct
lager
flavors
light
generic
hop
bite
some
hay
light
bodied
with
high
carbonation
yeah
this
isnt
very
good
even
for
the
style
i
dont
get
very
excited
about
in
the
first
place
appears

but
is
balanced
by
the
delicate
two

malts
punch
of

grassy
hops
really
does
well
in
this
beer
mouthfeel

what
more
can
one
ask
for
in
an
accessible
craft
beer
pils
overall
not
bad
but
i
would
rate
this
pretty
average
slightly
hazy
straw
colored
body
with
a
small
quickly
disappearing
head
aroma
is
a
nice
fresh
blend
of
spicy

sweet
bready

and
lager
cleanliness
flavor
is
more
rough
and
raw
grassy

spicy

which
is

bad
pretty
crisp
light
enough
body
too
rustic
and
bitter
for
my
pilsener
tastes
but
drinkable
a
liitle
too
metallic
for
my
tastes
but
im
going
to
give
this
another
shot
sometime
based
purely
on
reputation
o
sweetwater
has
a
good
pils
here
not
the
best
but
better
than
most
new
ones
ive
tried
lately
i
would
buy
this
again
o
the
pilsner
style
isnt
the
most
complex
one
but
sweetwater
makes
the
most
of
it
with
this
beer
light
and
refreshing
i
dont
know
if
it
was
a
production
error
or
what
i
tried
one
bottle
poured
into
a
glass
it
was
very
rusty
and
metallic
in
flavor
soft
floral
hops
and
malt
come
through
on
the
nose
easy
drinker
ok
alcohol
taste
this
is
a
pretty
good
take
on
a
german
pilsner
the
noble
hops
are
spicy
and
prevalent
this
is
an
easy
drinker
for
sure
the
pilsner
malt
used
is
crisp
and
refreshing
sweet
and
smooth
the
hops
are
biting
and
sharp
but
dont
overtake
what
the
beer
is
trying
to
be
a
good
pilsner
that
i
wish
i
had
found
earlier
in
the
summer
i
hope
they
dont
take
3
because
this
is
a
borderline
drain
pour
an
above
average
pils
o
one
of
my
favorite
offerings
from
sweetwater
and
a
nice
pils
for
the
summer
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
very
enjoyable
and
one
i
would
get
again
o
well
sweetwater
is
trying
to
nail
a
lager
and
they
do
much
better
than
any
macro
lager
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
overall
i
think
its
great
drinking
an
american
pilsner
and
not
having
to
wallow
in
corn
rice
and
mediocrity
im
glad
sweetwater
included
this
in
their
summer
variety

with
lots
of
gentle

the
smell
was
grainy
grassy
and
clean
with
just
a
touch
of
canned
corn
the
hops
were
definitely
abundant
here
and
were
the
first
thing
i
noticed
they
provided
a
spicy
start
and
then
they
turned
floral

herbal
there
was
a
creamy
finish
with
still
lingering
hops
and
a
hint
of
caramel
the
body
was
soft

silky

the
beer
was
easy
to

nicely
done
o
its

and
a
much
better
rendition
than
road

imo
well
done
sweetwater
decent
beer
more
like
a

but
you
can
feel
the
pilsner
in

it
is

get
a

try
in
my
pils
rotation
light

poured
from

the

a

of
slow

in
the
body
and
a
fluffy

with
a

backbone
and
lemongrass

highlights
with

the

overpower
a
bit
and
there
is
subtle

bitterness
that
enhances
that
imbalance
light
effervesced
body
that
moves
close
to
astringent

the

the

still
dry

almost
astringent
finish
oeverything
was
there
for
me
but
the
taste
didnt
seem
to
correlate
with
the
other
features
i
like
it
and
with
that
full
golden
haze
one
things
for
sure
sweetwater
isnt
about
to
over
filter
the
beer
for
eye
appeal
when
the
removal
of
its
cloudiness
would
also
remove
flavor
after
all
taste
appeal
wins
in
the
end
this
beer
is
a
good
beer
it
has
a
sweetness
taste
to
it
you
can
tell
it
is
a
pilsner
the
golden
color
it
has
is
a
great
look
i
like
the
sweetness
to
this
beer
it
does
not
have
an
after

like
some
beers
have
it

down

nothing
i

o

this

is

an

pilsner
glad
i

it
was

would
be

brew
an
interesting
twist
on
a
pilsner
from
the
brew
wizards
at
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
road
trip
is
a
bright
tasty
beer
bright
citrus
and
spicy
hops
are
the
rulers
of
the
roost
on
both
smell
and
taste
here
theres
some
pilsner
malt
that
isnt
quite
as
sharp
as
is
typical
but
the
spicy
hops
make
up
for
that
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
moderately
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
solid
but
probably
not
sessionable
overall
road
trip
is
a
solid
pilsnerstyle
beer
overall
was
hoping
for
something
crisp
refreshingly
and
hoppy
enough
to
make
it
interesting
this
wasnt
that
road

is
a
nice

most

it

that

it

ill
take

not
the
most
refreshing
pilsener
and
not
one
i
would
buy
again
glad
i
got
a
single
this
is
a
really
nice
and
unique
take
on
a
pilsener
it
isnt
as
clean
as
a
lager
might
be
but
the
ale
yeast
adds
a
little
extra
character
a
perfect
summer
beer
o
sadly
sweetwater
has
yet
to
truly
impress
me
with
any
of
their
brews
and
this
is
no
different
an
average
pilsener
with
some
fair
balance
is
all
to
be
had
here
this
is
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
springtime
beer
great
for
warm
day
o
very
drinkable
decent
beer
while
doing
some
yard
work
o
very
drinkable
in
large
amounts
a
nice
refreshing
brewbut
not
to
extravagent
this
is
a
nice
easy
drinking
pilsner
perfect
for
the
southern
spring
weather
its
flavorful
enough
to
keep
you
interested
but
also
light
enough
to
be
sessionable
drink
well
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
i
do
think
i
have
found
my
favorite
pils
o
a
solid
takon
the
style
and
an
enjoyable
brew
tap
this
comes
closer
to
true
pilsner
territory
crisp
and
grainy
with
a
stronger
noble
hop
character
more
bitterness
more
herbal
and
spicy
bite
kept
somewhat
in
check
by
a
smoothish
lightly
sweet
body
not
an
actual
pilsner
but
certainly
a
step
above
your
typical
goldenblonde
ale
good
stuff
t
nice
o
a
refreshing
pilsner
well
balanced
and
some
nice
citrus
notes
nothing
really
stands
out
but
a
decent
brew
its
light
and
refreshing
and
altogether
unorthodox
its
an
innovative
brew
that
just
tastes
good
a
tasty
hybrid
brew
of
sorts
good
substitute
of
there
are
no
authentic
pilsners
available
overall
this
beer
blurs
the
outer
boundaries
of
what
i
am
familiar
with
for
a
pilsner
i
like
that
it
is
different
especially
since
i
am
not
as
much
of
a
pilsner
fan
it
mixes
things
up
o
an
interesting
beer
i
think
the
ale
years
gives
it
a
unique
twang
but
the
taste
was
not
something
that
would
make
me
seek
it
out
again
o
easily
a
session
beer
which
holds
its
own
in
the
pils
category
this
beer
doesnt
take
you
to
any
extreme
as
it
is
a
simple
version
which
delivers
a
great
balance
of
hops
and
malt
with
whatever
chemistry
they
used
to
hold
the
edge
imho
this
is
a
very
medium
to
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
which
wont
let
the
buyer
down
o
this
beer
was
a
very
nice
simple
pilsner
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
they
didnt
overdo
the
hopping
this
which
lead
it
to
be
a
very
clean
and
easy
drinking
beer
sweetwater
i
think
has
a
balance
on
making
both
easy
drinking
beers
along
with
huge
over
the
top
beers
average
a
little
spicy
but
otherwise
nothing
that
strays
too
far
from
your
typical
pils
drinkable
a
slight
notch
above
your
everyday
pilsner
no
adjunct
corn
sweetness
and
a
light
floral
hoppiness
that
differentiates
it
its
a
pale
hazy
yellow
with
thin
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
minimal
spotty
sea
foam
lace
the
smell
is
crisp
dry
biscuit
malts
with
faint
floral
and
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
dry
biscuits
and
floral
notes
crisp
dry
and
refreshing
nicely
done
pilsner
but
nothing
that
stands
out
o
great
session
beer
nice
clean
and
crisp
great
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
overall
a
good
representation
of
a
classic
german
pils
very
nicely
done
o
meh
i
think
its
pretty
average
and
no
real
notes
on
taste
or
smell
really
jump
out
road
trip
feels
fine
enough
on
the
tongue
though
it
does
nothing
to
distinguish
itself
overall
this
is
a
below
average
pilsner
primarily
because
of
the
spurious
decision
to
ferment
the
beer
with
ale
yeast
of
some
kind
this
is
a
fine
enough
summer
drink
when
it
comes
in
the
sweetwater
variety
pack
but
this
is
certainly
nothing
to
seek
out
on
its
own
it
has
a
slightly
slick
mouth
i
thought
it
was
an
easy
drinking
representation
of
the
style
o
good
solid
brew
here
this
one
is
going
to
be
a
summer
staple
o
a
pretty
good
pilsner
by
sweetwater
i
could
drink
multiple
of
these
in
the
spring
and
summer
mfo
prickly
carbonation
light
in
body
with
a
fruity
and
wheaty
finish
o
uhg
not
much
here
pretty
bland
overall
i
really
enjoyed
this
not
hugely
aromatic
but
extremely
tasty
and
yummy
a
nice
and
unique
german
pils
m
thin
body
dry
carbonation
seems
a
little
higher
than
a
typical
pils
but
good
4
great
brew
not
as
bitter
as
i
expected
clean
finish
easily
could
finish
a
6pack
on
any
given
day
this
brew
has
just
enough
bite
to
keep
you
on
your
toes
sweetwater
has
yet
to
come
out
with
a
brew
imo
where
you
say
well
it
is
sorta
like
they
are
all
different
from
each
other
another
great
brew
from
the
best
brewery
in
the
south
keep
them
coming
guys
this
is
refreshing
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
these
in
a
session
d
it
seems
low
abv
and
it
is
a
fairly
smooth
beer
a
decent
6
pack
for
a
day
on
the
lake
but
nothing
here
is
all
that
special
o
very
drinkable
good
malt
character
not
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
many
of
the
style
bet
this
would
be
good
with
dish
if
wanted
a
relatively
light
beer
but
still
wanted
to
cut
some
spice
or
fatoil
it
started
out
as
a
pilsner
reads
the
label
that
may
be
but
the
end
product
is
a
decent
lightly
hopped
pale
with
a
slight
bitterness
against
a
light
malt
backbone
sadly
there
wasnt
much
that
stood
out
about
this
beer
while
not
bad
i
dont
know
that
theres
anything
here
that
makes
this
beer
memorable
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
light

road

12oz

like
a
bit
of
real
beer
into
a
glass
of
water
has
a
small
14
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
smells
of
steamed
veggies
and
other
adjuncts
in
the
corn
department
tastes
like
a
adjunct
lager
honestly
one
of
the
lower
grade
ones
a
touch
of
pale
and
crystal
malts
and
a
bit
of
noble
presence
this
is
another
that
i
wont
be
getting
again
from
sw
these
summer
creations
just
arent
up
to
par
with
the
rest
of
the
others
overall
if
you
get
it
from
a
pal
or
an
extra
in
a
trade
its
worth
a
shot
but
if
you
see
it
in
the
store
and
are
pondering
on
purchasing
your
best
bet
is
to
grab
whatever
is
sitting
beside
it
even
if
its
a
pack
of
swill
in
my
opinion
cheers
o
this
is
a
solid
summer
beer
all
around
got
a
decent
head
however
is
was
pretty
weak
and
died
quickly
coloring
is
light
yellow
that
i
didnt
expect
at
first
but
now
i
see
this
is
a
pilsner
thinking
it
was
a
pale
ale
smell
is
sweet
and
slightly
citrusy
i
always
have
trouble
picking
up
what
to
describe
the
sweentess
as
in
lagers
and
pilsners
i
guess
corn
anyways
has
quite
a
nice
pilsner
smell
taste
is
sharp
and
pleasantly
bitter
has
a
nice
underlined
sweetness
in
the
aftertaste
is
this
beer
a
hybrid
the
label
kind
of
suggested
it
was
but
it
really
does
have
a
pale
ale
quality
to
it
one
of
the
more
flavorful
pilsners
i
have
encountered
carbonation
is
cranked
up
pretty
high
but
i
actually
like
it
in
this
style
this
beer
is
solid
hats
off
to
sweetwater
for
making
such
a
tasty
pilsner
for
the
summer
well
done
pretty
good
hot
weather
drinker
o
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
represenation
for
the
style
if
someone
asks
me
to
recommend
an
american
made
pilsner
this
will
be
one
that
i
mention
this
is
flavorful
and
a
bit
off
kilter
for
the
style
and
i
like
it
a
lot
i
could
see
banging
these
back
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
o
just
bad
beer
i
dont
know
what
else
to
say
about
it
this
beer
has
diminished
my
view
of
sweetwaters
standing
as
a
brewery
overall
i
think
this
is
a
different
beer
from
one
year
to
the
next
o
definitely
not
a
keeper
from
sweetwater
although
it
matched
pretty
well
with
our
freshlycaught
trout
for
dinner
overall
its
sort
of
the
pilsner
youd
expect
from
a
popular
american
microbrewery
but
definitely
refreshing
this
will
be
a
common
purchase
for
me
during
these
upcoming
summer
months
o
a
nice
beer
especially
for
the
summer
months
this
pilsner
is
definitely
geared
more
toward
hop
heads
d
id
drink
again
bring
it
to
the
beach
and
enjoy
it
in
the
summer
time
for
sure
d
this
would
be
easy
to
toss
back
several
of
these
especially
with
the
hot
weather
this
is
a
good
summer
offering
in
my
opinion
i
will
surely
keep
this
in
mind
for
a
day
on
the
lake
or
some
such
d
this
was
a
pretty
enjoyable
beer
it
hit
the
spot
in
the
georgia
summer
heat
has
a
good
refreshing
flavor
worth
trying
sometime
served
from
bottle
into
an
ommegang
flute
poured
a
hazy
golden
yelloworange
with
a
two
finger
purewhite
head
that
subsided
to
one
finger
slowly
maintained
excellent
lacing
throughout
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
malt
wheat
and
citrus
the
flavor
pretty
much
followed
the
nose
with
wheat
citrus
and
subtle
malt
it
was
light
on
the
palate
with
low
carbonation
overall
this
was
not
really
that
great
but
not
horrible
either
i
think
it
could
have
used
a
little
more
malt
character
to
coverup
some
of
the
citrus
it
was
quite
refreshing
if
that
counts
for
anything
drinkability
flavorful
yet
easy
drinking
a
good
example
of
what
this
beer
could
beer
instead
of
what
you
often
see
it
becoming
in
the
world
of
macros
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
thick
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
crisp
malty
and
just
a
little
bit
fruity
mainly
apple
and
banana
flavor
is
mainly
malty
with
an
undertone
of
fruit
and
a
bit
of
hop
bitterness
strongly
fizzy
texture
leaves
behind
a
nice
tingle
on
the
lips
and
tongue
d
as
far
as
standard
pilsners
go
this
one
is
definitely
drinkable
a
pilsner
style
beer
with
an
ale
yeasthmm
now
thats
different
poured
lighter
lemony
yellow
with
a
fluffy
egg
shell
colored
one
finger
white
head
that
left
broken
lace
as
it
settled
into
a
creamy
mass
a
mix
of
toasted
bread
dough
with
a
bit
of
sweetness
and
ironmineralvery
pilsnerlike
flavors
are
crisp
with
that
doughy
charactera
nice
shot
of
herbal
hop
gives
a
nice
spicy
smack
in
the
finish
a
different
kind
of
hybrid
thats
pretty
goodi
would
buy
again
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
nice
eggshell
head
the
leaves
pretty
lacing
the
aroma
has
some
citrusy
and
floral
hops
upfront
along
with
biscuity
malt
lemon
zest
bread
dough
and
a
little
metallic
note
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
aroma
with
citrusy
floral
and
minty
hops
initially
along
with
some
metallic
notes
biscuit
and
hay
a
corn
syrup
sweetness
and
some
alcohol
the
mouthfeel
is
appropriately
light
and
drinkability
is
pretty
good
a
tasty
but
strange
beer
almost
seems
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
than
a
pilsner
but
it
doesnt
have
the
esters
or
caramel
malt
character
of
that
style
worth
trying
but
probably
my
least
favorite
of
sweetwaters
seasonals
not
impressed
sweetwater
continues
to
disappoint
notes
at
first
i
didnt
even
know
this
beer
was
a
pilsner
it
doesnt
hop
quite
the
hops
or
body
of
a
pale
ale
or
other
hoppy
ale
but
it
isnt
a
subdued
pilsner
i
like
it
though
the
flavor
could
be
a
little
better
but
this
is
a
good
beer
its
a
little
different
but
still
has
that
pilsner
character
d
this
beer
has
some
nice
lager
qualities
that
keep
this
beer
mellow
and
smooth
with
some
nice
fruity
ale
hints
as
well
there
is
a
nice
flavor
as
the
beer
is
cool
but
when
it
warms
there
is
a
bit
of
the
bitey
sulfur
and
field
corn
that
comes
through
all
around
solid
little
offering
here
from
sweetwater
with
a
surprising
bit
of
depth
in
the
taste
for
a
pilsner
anyway
tasty
and
quaffable
perfect
for
summer
imbibing
the
taste
is
relatively
sweet
with
a
grainy
malt
bill
there
is
a
nice
smoothness
to
this
beer
which
adds
an
interesting
element
theres
a
nice
sharp
hop
flavor
as
well
as
a
slight
skunk
taste
its
a
little
bit
drying
on
the
palate
all
in
all
not
a
bad
beer
this
may
be
the
first
middle
of
the
road
german
beer
ive
had
but
im
not
sure
if
id
be
interested
in
trying
this
style
again
d
very
drinkable
perfect
summer
beer
for
anyone
who
does
not
particularly
like
wheat
beers
overall
this
would
be
a
fine
aperitif
or
to
go
with
a
minimallyprepared
light
fish
dish
or
perhaps
a
summer
salad
a
fine
summery
brew
no
complaints
on
this
one
overall
nothing
too
special
but
a
bit
refreshing
inoffensive
and
tasty
this
didnt
really
seem
all
that
imperial
in
my
book
a
decent
brew
but
not
exactly
one
that
seems
to
fit
the
bill
for
this
style
kind
of
a
one
and
done
for
me
but
if
someone
offered
it
i
would
most
certainly
not
turn
it
down
overall
not
bad
and
again
for
a
double
it
went
down
like
candy
but
i
am
not
sure
i
would
pick
one
up
again
not
really
intresting
enough
overall
a
nice
beer
not
too
exciting
but
definitely
could
drink
a
few
at
at
timeperhaps
the
first
imperial
pilsner
type
that
i
have
had
i
have
a
few
more
from
sweetwater
that
ill
tryhopefully
they
are
a
bit
more
memorable
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
its
a
grassy
beer
a
bit
floral
and
quite
tasty
it
has
a
hoppy
bite
with
nearly
no
fruity
tones
its
almost
got
a
brown
ale
sort
of
taste
nice
good
but
not
great
beer
finally
got
around
to
this
last
bottle
from
my
sixer
i
purchased
about
6
months
ago
age
has
not
hurt
this
beer
at
all
while
ive
not
tried
cellaring
any
beer
i
find
this
bottle
to
have
benefited
from
some
time
in
my
bedroom
this
beer
has
the
typical
straw
yellow
color
associated
with
the
pilsner
style
the
taste
is
very
nice
with
that
unique
grassy
flavor
in
my
opinion
this
beer
is
as
good
as
victory
prima
pilsner
try
it
definitely
a
beer
for
out
back
by
the
grill
in
the
summer
i
could
also
see
sneaking
this
to
my
noncraft
friends
them
enjoying
it
a
great
deal
wellmade
brew
i
was
really
impressed
and
i
liked
the
story
on
how
it
was
made
on
the
bottle
clever
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
gold
with
a
frothy
bone
white
head
that
leaves
a
nice
film
and
a
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
is
full
of
bready
malts
along
with
spicy
and
floral
hops
the
flavor
has
a
subtle
malty
sweetness
but
is
dominated
by
spicy
and
floral
hops
normally
found
in
a
german
pils
the
mouthfeel
sports
a
lightmedium
body
with
effervescent
carbonation
overall
its
kind
of
an
american
pale
aleblonde
ale
with
german
hops
i
find
it
to
be
an
enjoyable
and
refreshing
summer
seasonal
with
enough
hop
bitterness
to
please
drinkability
refreshing
but
lacks
the
noble
hop
intensity
of
a
true
pilsener
mouthfeelmedium
hop
bitterness
hits
the
tongue
and
finishes
clean
the
label
says
it
started
as
a
pilsner
and
by
golly
it
sure
retains
almost
all
of
the
charcteristics
crisp
hoppiness
clean
finish
a
froth
on
the
plate
releases
some
sweet
malt
flavors
the
ale
yeast
maybe
took
some
of
the
bite
off
this
one
very
tasty
thirstquenching
a
lawnmower
beer
for
sure
sessionable
too
road
trip
is
a
pretty
well
made
brew
but
it
seems
to
fall
short
in
a
few
ways
not
really
sure
what
they
were
going
for
exactly
but
its
interesting
however
this
is
kind
of
boring
for
a
seasonal
release
usually
i
like
seasonals
to
be
a
bit
more
special
and
eyebrow
raising
that
being
said
i
could
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
on
those
hot
georgia
summer
days
like
we
are
having
now
but
i
wont
be
seeking
it
out
d
moderate
with
the
unknown
abv
average
head
dissipates
down
quickly
but
the
last
bit
sticks
around
to
the
end
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
little
bit
of
haziness
fairly
strong
sweet
and
grainy
aroma
initial
flavor
is
a
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
a
much
hoppier
finish
good
flavor
overall
mouthfeel
is
alright
with
average
carbonation
and
leaves
a
smooth
mouthcoating
overall
this
isnt
that
good
of
a
beer
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
and
i
cant
really
discern
the
purported
ale
portion
of
the
beer
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
an
entire
6
pack
as
i
said
this
isnt
representative
of
anyones
experiences
and
i
believe
the
sweetwater
dudes
thought
it
shouldve
laid
down
for
a
bit
longer
before
serving
it
but
whatever
i
totally
liked
it
after
sampling
this
brew
a
few
times
im
downgrading
taste
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
not
too
impressed
cant
get
over
the
weird
grassy
flavor
pours
a
clear
bubbly
gold
with
a
decent
puffy
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
very
grainy
with
some
faint
hop
aromas
in
there
smells
like
a
fairly
generic
pilsner
to
me
the
taste
was
more
of
the
same
with
grains
and
bit
of
light
biscuity
malts
before
a
slightly
bitter
and
very
crisp
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
with
a
bunch
of
carbonation
this
is
a
fairly
drinkable
brew
though
its
a
little
tough
to
discern
what
they
were
trying
to
do
with
this
one
as
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
double
pilsner
to
me
very
nice
md
very
easy
to
drink
and
a
very
clean
beer
i
think
the
word
clean
can
be
used
negatively
not
in
this
case
its
very
good
drinkability
is
fairly
high
decent
flavor
and
undetectable
alcohol
make
for
easy
consumption
d
the
drinkability
is
very
high
for
the
hot
summer
months
and
if
anything
this
beer
seems
like
a
good
representation
of
what
beer
may
have
tasted
like
before
prohibition
and
before
the
big
boys
took
over
with
their
mass
produced
rice
beers
d
best
aspect
of
beer
it
is
highly
drinkable
on
these
hot
ass
ga
days
d
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
as
drinkable
as
it
would
seem
the
finish
is
a
bit
too
dryingsour
for
me
and
the
body
isnt
quite
as
light
as
i
would
prefer
in
a
beer
of
this
style
d
pretty
drinkable
expecting
an
ale
but
got
more
of
a
pale
ale
just
a
bit
more
hoppy
if
that
is
your
bag
like
it
is
mine
this
a
beer
for
you
ok
nothing
special
decent
hopping
but
not
a
lot
else
going
on
medicinalsoap
tinge
not
a
plus
for
me
this
one
is
a
cloudy
yellow
with
some
white
foam
that
didnt
leave
much
lacing
at
all
on
the
glass
smelled
mildly
of
yeast
tasted
of
yeast
and
bitterness
and
a
slight
touch
of
citrus
my
palette
was
somewhat
fried
from
eating
jalapenos
not
long
before
drinking
this
though
so
there
might
have
been
more
to
it
at
any
rate
this
is
a
solid
and
very
drinkable
beer
a
blonde
with
saaz
hops
starts
neutral
creamy
bitterness
is
understated
grassy
and
theres
a
little
cutrus
mouthfeel
is
above
average
and
creamy
its
sessionable
its
smooth
drinking
beverage
and
it
should
appeal
to
lots
of
people
creamy
cloudy
yellow
overall
an
imperial
pils
huh
not
like
any
double
pils
ive
ever
had
but
good
nonetheless
a
good
hoppy
drinkable
brew
suitable
for
sessions
and
worth
a
try
sweet
blast
of
perfume
malt
moves
over
into
the
quaff
along
with
a
kick
of
hops

more
are
actually
needed
to
balance
out
the
overly
inyourface
perfume
malt
does
settle
down
by
midbottle
and
becomes
much
more
drinkable
quite
surprising
brew
covering
the
spectrum
of
taste
not
bad
and
a
rather
interesting
concoction
this
beer
cant
be
classified
as
anything
really
id
say
if
i
were
making
a
pilsener
at
home
and
something
happened
to
it
leading
me
to
add
an
ale
yeast
and
it
turned
out
like
this
id
be
pretty
thrilled
its
pretty
interesting
but
a
little
tweaking
needs
to
happen
to
the
recipe
next
time
poured
into
a
mug
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
white
head
that
slowly
faded
a
thin
lacy
was
visible
throughout
the
entire
beer
smell
was
of
citrus
hops
i
really
enjoyed
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
started
off
smooth
with
a
nice
bite
at
the
end
i
could
drink
these
all
day
not
as
good
as
the
420
but
still
a
solid
brew
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
clean
abv
is
not
listed
but
im
guessing
about
a
67
very
good
this
beer
doesnt
just
use
any
old
ale
yeast
i
am
convinced
it
is
a
belgian
yeast
it
has
that
belgian
spicy
twang
to
it
imo
its
brilliant
take
a
pilsner
grain
and
hop
bill
and
throw
in
a
belgian
pale
ale
yeast
excellent
twist
and
thank
god
for
something
different
available
in
alabama
right
now
if
it
werent
for
the
occasional
interesting
beer
coming
out
of
sweetwater
or
terrapin
id
be
in
the
funny
farm
drinkable
yes
drink
cold
when
your
hot
does
the
job
atlanta
road
trip
pours
crystal
clear
with
a
bright
golden
hue
the
head
is
snowwhite
and
dense
and
the
aroma
is
dominated
by
noble
hops
the
hops
saaz
dominate
the
tongue
as
you
sip
this
beer
but
do
not
completely
overwhelm
the
malt
the
mouth
is
not
crisp
like
a
pilsner
but
softer
and
creamier
im
guessing
from
the
ale
yeast
to
call
this
a
double
pilsner
is
incorrect
its
what
may
be
the
worlds
first
imperial
cream
ale
the
extreme
beer
movements
next
logical
step
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
a
good
cream
ale
so
this
beer
is
right
up
my
alley
easy
to
drink
but
the
whole
thing
is
a
little
out
of
balance
dmeh
i
am
having
this
after
a
90
minute
so
im
not
too
thrilled
not
bad
but
seems
a
bit
out
of
wack
d
this
would
be
easy
to
toss
back
several
of
these
especially
with
the
hot
weather
this
is
a
good
summer
offering
in
my
opinion
i
will
surely
keep
this
in
mind
for
a
day
on
the
lake
or
some
such
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
one
finger
head
very
mild
aroma
is
primarily
biscuits
grains
and
earthy
florals
taste
is
very
malty
with
grass
and
some
hop
bite
astringency
ruins
the
beer
a
little
too
heavy
for
a
summer
seasonal
for
my
taste
i
didnt
finish
the
bottle
too
much
astringency
here
it
is
mouth
puckering
and
not
very
pleasant
i
feel
like
i
have
been
sucking
on
aspirin
or
goodys
headache
powder
blech
i
suppose
its
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
have
more
than
about
two
or
three
in
one
sitting
nice
carbonation
but
that
doesnt
save
this
one
i
once
had
a
discussion
with
michael
jackson
the
bearded
one
not
the
gloved
one
about
tasting
beers
stylistically
vs
hedonistically
basically
the
conclusion
that
we
came
to
is
who
cares
about
the
style
what
really
matters
is
simply
how
the
beer
tastes
well
i
looked
at
the
label
for
road
trip
and
didnt
see
anything
about
style
i
didnt
bother
to
actually
read
the
writing
to
the
side
that
explained
it
i
just
poured
it
and
figured
id
figure
it
out
it
was
golden
ok
slightly
hazy
ok
smelled
a
touch
spicy
ok
i
figured
it
was
a
witbier
but
it
wasnt
it
was
very
dry
not
brashly
bitter
but
assertive
for
sure
there
was
a
bit
of
fruitiness
to
it
kind
of
like
grapefruit
and
a
subtle
tartness
in
the
background
i
teetered
i
kind
of
liked
it
kind
of
didnt
i
supposed
i
could
take
it
or
leave
it
which
basically
means
id
leave
it
then
i
read
the
label
noting
that
it
was
intended
as
a
pilsner
and
changed
my
opinion
of
the
beer
completely
i
just
didnt
see
it
as
a
pilsner
with
an
ale
yeast
it
seemed
like
american
hops
were
used
or
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
or
off
batch
it
was
within
code
hmmmm
how
easily
were
influenced
so
taking
a
step
back
i
can
say
that
hedonistically
i
didnt
really
dig
it
it
was
ok
i
think
it
would
go
great
at
a
backyard
barbeque
i
might
have
one
at
a
bar
but
otherwise
i
wouldnt
go
for
it
just
my
opinion
d
easily
quaffed
and
overall
enjoyable
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
and
ive
never
had
a
double
pilsner
before
but
this
was
a
solid
sipper
and
one
ill
go
back
to
if
this
truly
a
double
pilsner
it
misses
the
mark
but
frankly
i
think
it
is
very
flavorful
and
quite
enjoyable
flavor
is
just
wierd
ale
body
and
texture
but
a
pilsner
flavor
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
bipolar
schizophrenic
beer
malts
and
biscuits
and
something
akin
to
wet
paper
i
would
almost
say
this
beer
is
passed
its
prime
but
the
bottle
says
best
before
91707
plus
it
is
summer
and
this
is
the
summer
seasonal
hops
give
off
a
wierd
sourness
that
is
like
sucking
on
cardboard
alelike
body
is
a
bit
heavy
for
the
style
not
something
i
would
grab
on
a
hot
summer
day
flavor
was
a
mild
spicy
hop
though
no
spice
in
particular
jumped
out
finish
was
thirst
quenching
and
of
medium
duration
overall
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
with
a
low
enough
abv
5
3
that
it
would
be
a
good
session
beer
i
find
myself
buying
it
repeatedly
because
its
unique
and
really
works
with
this
typical
georgia
summer
drinkability
this
beer
didnt
come
together
for
me
at
all
so
far
these
sweetwater
catch
release
beers
are
0
for
2
with
me
release
release
by
the
time
i
finished
the
beer
i
had
forgotten
about
my
hand
road
trip
is
an
interesting
tasting
beer
but
it
although
it
taste
is
unique
it
is
easy
to
drink
pours
a
fairly
typical
pilsner
dark
gold
with
a
nice
initial
head
that
fades
quickly
no
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
have
some
of
that
lager
tanginess
but
the
finish
on
both
goes
in
a
different
direction
an
smells
more
like
a
pale
ale
a
double
pilsner
this
is
not
but
a
pilsner
with
added
ale
yeast
i
could
see
it
as
nice
heft
and
crispness
but
a
disappointing
lack
of
hops
on
the
finish
refreshing
even
fairly
tasty
but
this
could
have
been
more
at
first
i
liked
this
as
it
was
different
when
i
purchased
a
six
pack
it
did
not
seem
as
good
the
pils
malt
was
overpowered
by
the
saaz
haops
which
to
me
gave
it
a
skunky
flavor
i
may
buy
more
in
the
future
as
i
may
have
purchased
from
a
bad
batch
but
if
it
is
the
same
this
beer
is
not
to
my
personal
likings
its
not
a
horrible
beer
in
fact
this
could
be
a
decent
gateway
beer
for
bud
drinkers
it
is
just
does
not

me

and
woody
with
a
note
of

this
was
a
smooth
crisp
clean
tasting
beer
with
a
mild
hop
presence
but
a
good
bitter
sensation
would
make
for
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
ok
going
down
but
the
bitterness
may
hinder
some
people
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
this
beer
is
a
nice
clear
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
there
is
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
in
the
beer
the
smell
is
somewhat
like
a
wheat
the
taste
is
light
and
the
yeast
used
gives
the
beer
a
strange
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fairly
smooth
with
the
flavor
lsating
a
while
the
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
but
different
im
having
a
hard
time
finishing
this
beer
but
my
daddy
didnt
raise
a
quitter
poured
out
mostly
like
a
pilsner
for
sure
with
a
pale
clear
body
and
lots
of
carbonation
however
unlike
the
lagers
from
bohemia
this
one
seemed
to
have
no
trouble
forming
and
holding
a
pillowy
and
foamy
head
the
aroma
was
spicy
which
i
presume
was
due
to
use
of
saaz
hops
there
was
very
slight
hint
of
dms
in
the
form
of
cooked
corn
but
it
did
not
smell
out
of
place
for
a
fresh
pilsner
the
taste
was
softer
than
a
pilsner
with
lingering
sweetness
that
was
very
pleasing
the
hops
were
present
the
form
of
a
mineralized
backbone
the
mouthfeel
was
creamy
and
soft
it
was
hard
to
shoehorn
this
into
a
style
but
id
put
it
somewhere
between
a
strong
ale
cream
ale
and
pilsner
no
abv
listed
on
the
label
but
the
alcohol
was
not
a
big
factor
so
i
would
venture
a
guess
at
this
being
in
the
neighborhood
of
56
very
easy
to
drink
with
no
flaws
found
in
any
department
which
id
say
is
a
pretty
damn
good
piece
of
work
considering
the
major
departure
from
the
original
recipe
enjoyed
this
one
on
my
back
porch
beer
pours
a
golden
straw
color
thats
somewhat
hazy
at
the
top
of
the
glass
i
soon
discover
this
has
more
to
due
with
the
80
degree
heat
than
the
characteristics
of
the
beer
lots
of
carbonations
bubbles
float
to
the
top
where
sits
a
very
loose
oneinch
head
of
very
large
bubbles
looks
like
a
runofthemill
pilsner
the
nose
however
is
something
different
all
together
had
i
not
read
the
label
to
discover
this
a
pilsner
hybrid
brewed
with
ale
yeast
i
still
wouldve
known
something
was
up
from
the
nose
it
smells
like
a
pilsner
but
there
is
something
unique
about
the
aroma
that
i
cant
quite
put
my
finer
on
there
is
a
big
biscuity
malt
smell
present
whatever
it
is
its
appetizing
to
say
the
least
the
taste
is
a
quick
snap
of
hop
bitterness
not
overwhelming
but
perhaps
a
bit
more
than
say
a
pilsner
urquell
this
gives
way
to
a
long
biscuity
middle
before
fading
into
a
dry
crisp
clean
finish
the
aftertaste
is
pretty
long
and
dominated
by
a
citrus
note
pretty
tasty
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
that
seems
to
be
the
aim
all
things
considered
this
is
a
pretty
exceptional
summertime
beer
great
for
a
ball
game
or
hanging
out
by
the
pool
its
clean
extremely
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
im
sure
some
hopheads
might
find
it
to
weak
or
dull
but
this
is
indeed
a
session
beer
and
a
refreshing
one
at
that
i
will
be
hitting
this
one
up
again
very
soon
the
beer
looks
like
budweiser
or
any
other
pale
gold
beer
out
there
not
much
for
a
head
i
couldnt
really
pick
up
much
of
a
nose
on
it
drank
great
though
nice
session
beer
decent
pilsner
could
do
worse
snow
globe
type
carbonation
has
that
typical
german
hop
pale
malt
scent
not
too
much
variations
in
these
german
pilsners
but
they
are
consistent
with
taste
and
feel
which
is
good
nice
head
that
holds
up
well
nothing
to
brag
about
here
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
not
much
to
knock
except
how
forgettable
it
is
not
something
i
would
pursue
again
11
2
oz
is
lame
and
hurts
sales
here
in
my
opinion
would
drink
again
knowing
its
better
than
those
american
macro
lagers
the
price
point
on
the
beer
is
too
high
also
considering
the
alternatives
overall
good
cheers
an
excellent
pilsner
one
of
the
best
not
to
be
underestimated
smooth
clean
flavor
with
a
nice
rich
malt
backbone
and
bright
finish
it
is
really
good
beer
never
disappoints
overall
a
mildly
hoppy
beer
good
introduction
to
pilsners
with
its
history
i
conclude
that
this
is
how
pilsners
mustve
tasted
mouthfeel
is
solid
im
usually
very
critical
with
my
reviews
but
this
one
was
a
pleasant
surprise
i
purchased
a
can
from
the
lcbo
pours
a
beautiful
amber
with
very
little
head
that
doesnt
stay
long
smells
slightly
musky
and
spicy
with
a
grassy
overtone
initial
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
beautiful
carbonation
taste
that
is
expansive
but
stops
just
short
of
full
bodied
the
hops
character
is
well
balanced
a
very
nice
lingering
aftertaste
and
refreshing
and
satisfying
overall
for
2
45
cad
a
can
this
is
a
very
light
and
refreshing
brew
definitely
not
the
best
german
style
pilsner
around
but
it
is
authentic
enough
and
quite
good
the
irony
is
that
i
lived
in
germany
for
many
years
and
never
had
a
chance
to
taste
this
particular
beer
i
am
no
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
was
just
aweful
overall
this
certainly
aint
a
good
pilsener
awkward
aroma
and
flavour
with
a
bittering
aftertaste
that
is
vinegary
instead
of
hopdriven
ill
leave
this
one
alone
even
for
au43
a
case
relatively
cheap
for
canadian
prices
as
an
added
bonus
this
is
good
valued
german
pils
its
readily
available
at
my
favorite
liquor
store
always
fresh
a
good
seller
obviouslyand
priced
handsomely
in
12
pack
containers
the
lower
price
may
fool
you
into
thinking
its
a
cheap
beer
but
its
not
quality
exudes
with
its
pure
golden
color
thick
white
head
and
generous
lacing
glass
side
its
flavor
is
a
wonderful
balance
of
drybitter
hops
yet
with
a
very
faint
hint
of
sweetness
it
retains
its
carbonation
all
the
way
to
the
end
of
your
glass
keeping
things
interesting
this
is
an
excellent
session
beer
4
or
5
go

and
the

a

i
have
been
buying
this
one
for
a
while
and
it
is
usually
found
in
my
fridge
however
this
beer
is
a
screaming
deal
at

if
you
can
find
them

again
for
sure
this
is
plenty
drinkable
if
youre
looking
for
a
light
lager
with
a

overall
i
thought
this
was
a
nice
beer
and
a
above
average
example
of
a
pilsner
it
had
all
the
aspects
that
i
look
for
in
a
german
made
pilsner
and
it
seemed
to
be
just
a
nice
and
easy
drinking
straight
forward
example
of
the
style
this
beer
had
nice
drinkability
it
was
smooth
fairly
clean
fairly
crisp
dry
on
the
finish
not
filling
at
all
and
the
taste
did
a
decent
job
of
holding
my
attention
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
especially
when
its
hot
outside
what
i
like
the
most
about
this
beer
was
how
true
to
style
it
was
its
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
german
made
pilsner
what
i
liked
the
least
about
this
beer
was
nothing
theres
nothing
that
i
disliked
or
would
change
about
this
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
when
in
the
mood
for
the
style
and
i
recommend
it
to
anybody
that
loves
a
good
easy
drinking
and
traditional
example
of
a
pilsner
all
in
all
i
was
happy
with
this
beer
it
delivered
just
what
i
wanted
it
to
and
im
glad
i
took
a
chance
on
it
this
made
for
a
nice
first
impression
for
this
brewery
and
i
would
be
interested
in
trying
more
of
their
beer
and
i
think
its
up
there
as
one
of
the
better
german
pilsners
ive
had
good
job
guys
this
was
an
enjoyable
pilsner
keep
up
the
hard
work
overall
this
is
a
well
done
pils
i
have
had
better
but
this
is
a
good
representation
of
the
style
i
dig
this
beer
it
is
an
easy
drinker
that
pairs
well
with
grilled
pork
chops
burgers
and
of
course
sausages
near
medium
body
with
medium
carbonation
clean
and
crisp
but
with
more
body
than
many
pilsners
o
overall
a
nice
crisp
easy
drinking
pilsner
nothing
mind
blowing
but
solid
and
what
i
was
looking
for
i
like
the
beer
as
i
do
many
others
the
point
being
there
are
a
lot
of
beers
in
this
world
to
chose
from
and
now
radeberger
has
decided
to
cut
their
bottle
size
from
12
oz
to
11
2
oz
in
the
name
of
profits
so
its
time
to
move
on
to
one
of
the
many
others
available
that
are
every
bit
as
good
if
not
better
and
still
use
12
oz
bottles
grains
clean
hops
mild
sweetness
are
the
terms
i
would
use
to
describe
this
pilsener
and
it
is
a
pilsener
nothing
more
nothing
less

nevetheless
full
of
flavor
and
body
fantastic
overall
a
very
tasty
and
well
made
pilsner
that
is
comfortble
in
its
skin
a
keeper
overall
good
german
brew
got
a
mug
to
take
home
with
it
too
i
am
generally
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
and
this
one
is
no
exception
this
beer
is
very
thin
and
brightish
yellow
with
no
head
to
speak
of
and
it
tastes
thin
and
very
flat
and
bland
the
lack
of
flavor
only
accentuates
the
flatness
and
vice
versa
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
disliked
it
then
too
will
definitely
avoid
in
the
future
a
bit
thin
on
the
mouthfeel
but
still
very
crisp
the
flavors
arent
very
exciting
but
its
still
clean
drinking
and
good
for
the
style
found
this
one
at
a
local
beer
pusher
for
6
99
a
sixer
and
figured
it
was
worth
a
try
generic
lookcolor
average
foam
good
carbonationmouthfeel
crisp
clean
flavor
yeah
i
could
pound
back
a
boatload
of
these
while
nothing
spectacular
theres
also
nothing
offensive
or
heavya
good
drinking
beer
with
friends
worth
a
try
cheers
o
overall
at
0
75
per
bottle
this
was
an
excellent
deal
a
refreshing
pilsner
with
an
excellent
flavor
palate
and
great
mouth
feel
id
recommend
this
though
it
is
not
ground
shaking
its
still
good
oextremely
drinkable
pilsener
i
could
drink
this
like
water
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
i
plan
to
for
a
widely
available
pilsener
this
is
very
good
overall
good
beer
choice
for
a
party
especially
if
you
plan
to
drink
much
the
brewery
dates
to
the
previous
century
in
radeberg
near
dresden
the
communists
took
over
e
germany
but
kept
the
brewery
open
in
fact
it
was
the
favorite
of
the
dresden
kgb
chief
vladimir
putin
interesting
story
thank
goodness
this
brewery
survived
long
enough
to
see
the
fall
of
the
iron
curtain
it
is
thriving
now
that
it
is
free
excellent
beer
crisp
sharp
excellent
taste
excellent
aftertaste
well
balanced
bitterness
fresh
nicely
colored
and
transparent
with
beerish
hue
one
of
the
best
beers
was
served
in
bottle
properly
cooled
and
consumed
late
night
among
several
others
o
plenty
of
better
domestic
pils
to
choose
from
i
need
to
try
a
fresh
german
pils
someday
the
creator
of
the
canquest
woodychandler
comes
through
with
yet
another
canned
beer
poured
from
a
16
9
oz
can
has
a
light
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
lots
of
carbonation
smell
is
a
bit
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
light
and
mild
some
malts
thirst
quenching
but
not
overly
flavorful
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
would
make
a
good
hot
weather
beer
but
lacking
a
bit
of
punch
o
a
really
good
pilsner
tasty
on
a
hot
day
poured
from
a
355
ml
bottle
pours
a
pale
lemon
yellow
which
belies
its
bold
flavour
nose
is
classic
pilsner
crackerygrainy
malt
with
with
crisp
grassy
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
also
wellbalanced
a
little
sweetness
up
front
with
nuttycrackery
malt
notes
and
a
decent
dry
bitter
finish
ample
carbonation
offers
a
refreshing
mouthfeel
very
solid
i
got
a
good
crack
followed
by
an
inverted
glug
resulting
in
twoplus
fingers
of
dense
rocky
bonewhite
head
that
resembled
the
top
of
a
softserve
ice
cream
cone
before
it
began
to
settle
color
was
a
bright
sunshineyellow
with
nequality
clarity
nose
had
a
smell
like
field
grain
light
for
a
german
pils
and
kind
of
cereallike
with
no
discernible
hop
presence
mouthfeel
was
soft
light
very
smooth
the
taste
had
that
same
cereallike
quality
that
i
noted
on
the
nose
and
maybe
a
light
grassiness
of
hops
finish
was
still
cereallike
prevalently
and
the
grassiness
lingered
lightly
in
the
background
after
the
finish
i
feel
like
the
style
should
be
slightly
sweeter
and
exhibit
more
noble
hops
character
but
ymmv
good
and
easy
to
drink
but
with
a
funky
offness
at
the
finish
overall
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
i
like
most
of
them
but
this
one
always
seemed
just
a
bit
better
than
many
of
the
others
in
the
style
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
head
with
low
retention
traditional
aroma
of
pale
malt
and
a
touch
of
grassy
hops
again
balanced
flavor
of
sweet
malt
and
grassy
hops
notes
of
pepper
and
lemon
dry
and
bitter
aftertaste
light
body
with
good
carbonation
i
was
positively
surprised
with
this
beer
good
drinkability
flavorful
plain
though
assertive
great
german
pilsner
option
from
a
macro
brewery
o
i
can
see
how
people
could
sit
around
and
drink
a
beer
like
this
all
day
i
would
be
very
comfortable
plopping
a
barrel
of
this
on
a
table
for
a
summer
bbq
or
pool
party
or
any
event
where
people
should
be
drinking
for
a
considerable
amount
of
time
what
a
surprisingly
good
macro
pilsner
option
out
of
germany
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
this
very
simple
but
gets
to
the
point
of
what
its
trying
to
be
gently
flavored
well
seasoned
refreshing
and
super
quaffable
i
paired
this
with
fish
and
chips
and
it
worked
well
with
me
far
more
interesting
than
warsteiner
paulaner
and
spaten
in
the
realm
of
macro
pilsners
why
are
people
buying
stuff
like
becks
this
is
super
affordable
crowd
pleasing
and
easy
to
drink
and
a
far
better
example
of
this
style
great
stuff
to
the
point
just
lacks
character
as
far
as
pilsners
go
its
only
decent
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
a
german
pilsner
there
are
better
ones
sure
but
this
one
is
inexpensive
and
made
very
well
looks
better
than
it
tasted
i
expected
more
from
a
german
pilsner
prost
lampertland
i
was
at
the
brewery
on
a
tour
from
the
dresden
dampflok
treffen
and
after
the
brewery
tour
was
given
a
tase
it
is
a
very
old
beer
brewery
and
produces
a
quality
pilsner
i
feel
it
too
like
most
really
good
beers
in
germany
they
have
suffered
from
success
and
if
they
are
producing
enough
beer
to
keep
60000
bottles
an
hour
bottling
machines
busy
the
beer
is
being
mass
produced
and
is
suffering
from
its
success
i
have
tasted
the
bottled
beer
and
it
is
not
as
tasty
as
that
at
the
brewery
also
very
nice
no
astringency
or
off
putting
skunk
flavors
i
normally
find
in
the
style
on
the
heavier
side
of
being
light
bodied
creamy
carbonation
initial
bready
sweetness
sweetness
through
off
by
nice
brisk
carbonated
bite
and
a
spicy
and
earthy
hop
character
bitterness
is
moderate
and
the
beer
is
more
balanced
then
anything
flavorful
and
very
drinkable
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
can
drink
it
everytime
seems
to
be
the
beer
of
choice
for
two
and
a
half
men
meaningless
fact
upon
tasting
i
am
also
picking
up
apple
and
a
very
slight
herbal
hint
perhaps
rosemary
bready
is
a
very
apt
descriptor
here
and
the
hopds
are
almost
lemony
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
very
refreshing
and
refined
appealing
brown
bottle
with
white
and
gold
labels
with
a
freshness
date
that
is
most
welcome
it
has
that
perfect
herbal
hop
aroma
smell
that
projects
a
fresh
crispness
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
clean
with
some
pleasant
spicy
bitterness
and
fair
amount
of
carbonation
yet
another
example
of
a
quality
german
pilsner
so
what
are
you
reading
this
for
go
get
some
a
very
tasty
german
pilsner
one
that
ill
be
adding
to
my
favorites
of
the
style
i
would
very
much
like
to
return
to
this
in
the
spring
or
summer
as
it
would
be
an
outstanding
backyard
beer
poured
a
golden
colour
large
foamy
head
moderate
retention
had
some
lacing
clear
aroma
was
nutty
mushroomy
and
hoppy
i
also
picked
up
some
booze
which
was
surprising
given
the
moderate
abv
tasted
a
malty
rather
than
hoppy
bitterness
notes
of
grain
and
grass
a
bit
bready
finish
was
sour
dough
like
medium
body
well
carbonated
fairly
coarse
edge
i
remember
liking
this
beer
better
in
the
past
fairly
average
feel
is
also
nice
the
carbonation
is
frothy
and
despite
its
look
at
style
theres
actually
a
rich
creamy
feel
to
this
overall
i
cannot
say
many
things
bad
about
this
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
pilsner
beers
and
this
brew
is
definitely
a
more
appealing
brand
than
others
a
case
was
available
for
a
very
reasonable
price
at
a
wholesale
store
considering
this
was
my
first
time
drinking
this
brand
it
was
a
bit
of
a
gamble
to
commit
to
such
a
large
quantity
of
beer
it
proved
to
be
worthwhile
and
i
would
definitely
drink
this
again
i
bought
a
6
pack
at
whole
fools
on
sale
and
would
buy
it
again
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
refreshing
and
it
pairs
nicely
with
just
about
any
food
as
it
feels
like
it
cleanses
the
palate
also
the
beer
is
well
balanced
between
the
flavors
of
the
malts
and
the
hops
not
overly
bitter
or
sweet
brown
long
neck
halflitre
bottle
six
months
before
the
sellby
date
its
a
good
german
pils
but
the
bitterness
is
too
much
on
my
scale
overall
well
executed
german
pilsner
more
malty
but
theres
enough
hop
to
bring
solid
balance
especially
in
the
finish
got
it
on
sale
for
a
buckfifty
at
bevmo
and
it
was
well
worth
the
price
i
might
have
to
buy
a
bottle
or
two
more
before
the
price
goes
back
up
o
better
than
some
pilsners
worse
than
others
pretty
good
for
the
style
but
nothing
really
jumps
out
would
have
scored
higher
but
the
un
ripe
apple
aspect
threw
me
off
this
yellow
somewhat
sweet
pils
is
a
little
light
on
hops
both
in
the
taste
and
in
the
smell
some
of
this
style
have
considerably
more
going
on
that
said
it
is
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
although
i
will
not
seek
it
out
again
it
is
not
something
to
be
avoided
or
anything
its
worth
trying
o
solid
german
pils
goes
good
with
food
or
by
itself
if
you
want
to
throw
back
a
few
rjt
popping
the
top
this
brew
has
a
classic
grassy
pilsner
smell
with
a
nice
pungent
hop
odor
pours
to
a
straw
color
with
a
light
foamy
head
that
dissipates
fast
taste
is
consistent
more
bitter
than
sweet
with
a
strong
bitter
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
light
on
target
for
the
style
a
good
beer
very
in
line
with
the
style
nothing
spectacular
but
solid
nevertheless
great
to
wash
down
a
bratwurst
with
sauerkraut
tastepilsner
malt
faintly
floral
a
soft
herbal
hop
note
comes
in
at
the
finish
and
quitly
hangs
around
very
refreshing
and
sessionable
500
ml
bottle
clear
yellow
color
slightly
flowery
smell
but
overall
not
very
aromatic
taste
is
light
floral
and
watery
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
thats
hangs
around
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
smooth
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
slightly
above
average
refreshing
very
easy
to
drink
and
no
off
tastes
good
for
a
hot
day
staw
with
a
finger
of
fine
whites
brilliant
clarity
sweet
pilsner
malts
with
a
nice
woody
and
piny
nose
interesting
take
on
the
style
for
the
geography
takes
on
a
almost
peppery
nose
flavor
is
grain
with
a
hint
of
corn
and
some
dry
earthy
hops
flavor
not
as
interesting
as
the
nose
thin
with
moderate
carb
and
an
offdry
finish
decent
but
nothing
to
call
for
seconds
on
overall
a
middle
of
the
road
pilsner
which
is
highly
quaffable
it
comes
together
well
on
this
sunny
spring
day
ov
it
doesnt
blow
you
away
but
it
isnt
supposed
to
you
drink
one
it
becomes
two
then
three
its
engaging
and
invites
you
to
keep
drinking
im
glad
this
bar
has
it
half
off
i
hope
the
keg
doesnt
blow
cheers
o
i
like
it
its
not
my
first
choice
but
not
my
last
either
theres
nothing
standout
about
it
in
any
regards
overall

very
good
beer
this
would
be
amazing
with
rich
food
as
i
could
see
its
dryness
cutting
through
the
rich
food
like
a
razor
as
a
session
beer
it
is
excellent
light
and
satisfying
highly
recommended
on
the
nose
the
beer
is
floral
mainly
floral
but
light
refreshing
in
the
aroma
taste
is
thin
and
light
malty
with
somewhat
of
a
bitterness
but
nothing
to
call
your
mom
similar
as
bitburger
nice
summer
beer
nice
pilsner
but
not
aggressive
at
all
thin
bodied
refreshing
overall
a
good
pilsner
but
it
is
missing
some
punch
to
be
great
i
like
it
for
thirsty
and
hot
summer
days
i
found
it
quite
average
although
it
comes
in
a
bottle
with
lots
of
golden
colours
on
the
label
and
a
golden
foil
on
the
neck
so
i
expected
it
to
be
one
bit
more
premium
tastes
very
malty
much
more
is
present
than
hides
behind
the
faint
smell
strong
carbonation
the
whole
way
through
but
strangely
little
head
remains
on
top
overall
this
beer
makes
itself
known
in
your
mouth
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
id
definitely
drink
this
again
though
im
not
sure
id
seek
it
out
especially
drink
again
not
a
style
i
would
normally
seek
out
but
didnt
want
to
waste
10
beers
so
what
the
hell
the
next
few
beers
should
prove
enlightening
d
quaffable
but
not
all
that
interesting
o
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
vibrant
pilsner
out
of
germany
i
had
alot
of
fun
swishing
this
beer
around
and
getting
the
full
extent
of
it
i
would
not
chug
this
beer
it
does
great
taking
medium
mouthfulls
and
taking
in
the
character
of
the
beer
as
a
fan
of
pilsner
beers
i
will
chaulk
this
up
as
a
buy
again
brand
flavors
are
nondistinct
nothing
jumps
out
at
you
the
overall
experience
is
what
i
love
about
this
beer
mildly
bitter
with
the
taste
of
fermented
barley
it
doesnt
get
any
simpler
or
cleaner
than
this
lightly
baked
pilsner
malt
some
water
cracker
malt
combined
grassy
hops
this
is
a
classic
clan
mineraly
pilsner
that
can
be
drank
and
drunk
and
so
on
till
the
cows
come
home
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
crisp
but
smooth
and
goes
down
easy
as
it
has
a
medium
sized
body
there
is
a
nice
drinkable
feel
and
is
easy
going
down
i
brought
a
can
of
radeberger
home
from
europe
i
forgot
i
had
tried
this
beer
while
at
the
german
village
in
epcot
disney
amusement
park
anyway
i
will
review
the
can
since
it
traveled
so
far
the
beer
from
the
can
was
a
clear
golden
beer
with
decent
carbonation
that
provided
a
decent
head
the
smell
was
mostly
of
grain
standard
for
pilsners
the
taste
was
nicely
balanced
that
the
grain
came
off
the
pallete
clean
very
easy
drinking
and
highly
recommended
much
like
its
draft
sibling
the
can
is
not
too
shabby
poured
this
german
pilsner
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
straw
color
produced
a
nice
thick
head
that
had
excellent
retention
lacing
was
average
the
aroma
was
grain
and
smelled
much
like
white
wine
grapes
the
body
of
this
brew
is
light
has
a
malted
grain
base
bitter
earthy
herbal
hops
that
gives
way
to
the
taste
and
finish
of
cauliflower
nice
example
of
a
traditional
german
pilsner
easy
to
drink
good
session
beer
and
great
buy
at
1
99
for
a
22
oz
bottle
prefer
this
to
many
mass
produced
german
pilsners
i
really
like
this
beer
it
goes
great
with
mexican
food
and
i
crave
it
every
now
and
then
even
though
im
a
registered
hophead
simple
solid
what
do
you
really
expect
from
a
german
pils
gotta
differ
with
the
alstroms
on
this
oneyeah
you
could
session
this
but
there
are
so
many
better
more
interesting
sessionable
beers
on
the
market
id
have
to
wonder
why
anyone
with
interesting
in
flavorful
craft
beer
would
choose
to
do
so
notes

relatively

lots

some

a

malty

a
zingy

firm

dry

with

light
crisp
feel
is
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
a
good
representative
of
the
style
that
you
can
session
with
ease
this
beer
pours
with
less
head
than
id
expect
from
a
german
pils
but
its
fairly
normallooking
otherwise
earthy
hops
and
mineral
notes
comprise
the
mainstay
of
the
nose
with
breadydoughy
notes
underlying
the
flavor
is
along
the
same
lines
with
clean
finish
as
the
brew
airs
out
a
bit
it
gains
a
modicum
of
floral
honey
sweetness
the
various
elements
at
play
make
for
less
crispness
than
the
style
calls
for
as
it
has
a
bit
of
a
soft
sweetness
that
is
more
befitting
say
a
dortmunder
allaround
the
beer
is
pretty
good
but
id
reach
for
a
jever
or
flensburger
over
this
one

at

possible

and
clean

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
german
pilsener
i
am
glad
i
got
to
try
this
beer
as
i
have
never
seen
it
anywhere
else
for
sale
crystal
clear
and
bright
yellow
with
a
white
foamy

looks
nice
a

a
hint
of

spiciness
malt
and

moderate
bitterness
that
was
never
aggressive
but
ever
present
it
also
lingered
in
the
finish
along
with
some
herbal
and
spicy
hop
flavour
and
a
faint
mineral
character
mild
malty
sweetness
up
front
followed
by
lemony
and
grassy
hop
notes
a
little
more
than
light
bodied
with
crisp
carbonation
offdry
nice
texture
overall
this
was
really
easy
drinking
its
no
hopbomb
but
there
is
plenty
of
hop
character
and
its
well
balanced
i
enjoyed
it
and
would
happily
purchase
it
again
d
the
smells
and
flavors
of
this
beer
are
mostly
on
the
mark
but
they
really
dont
come
through
very
strongly
the
metallic
taste
brings
this
one
down
a
few
notches
in
my
book
the
beer
pours
out
a
very
light
yellow
in
color
with
a
very
small
pure
white
head
and
light
lacing
the
smell
on
our
pour
was
really
light
but
its
slightly
hopped
and
somewhat
grassy
the
beer
is
crisp
smooth
and
on
the
lighter
side
for
mouthfeel
the
taste
is
slightly
hoppy
somewhat
herbally
and
finishes
dry
overall
its
an
unimposing
beer
on
the
palate
and
drinks
extremely
easily
overall
i
like
this
pilsener
very
much
nice
levels
of
malt
and
hops
but
not
a
complex
beer
good
on
a
hot
day
id
have
another
overall
a
solid
choice
to
go
with
a
meal
but
nothing
so
special
that
i
would
particularly
choose
it
on
any
other
occasion
this
is
good
german
brew
i
really
enjoyed
it
solid
pils
to
come
out
of
eastern
germany
an
adequate
pick
to
wash
down
lunch
poured
a
2
white
head
as
i
drank
the
glass
gradually
successive
rings
of
foam
stayed
stuck
to
the
glass
in
a
pretty
cool
effect
clear
straw
yellow
body
smell
and
taste
are
both
pretty
much
bmc
style
with
a
little
extra
edge
minimal
finish
certainly
a
nice
pilsner
but
not
sure
if
its
among
the
elite
my
second
brew
during
my
first
visit
to
the
brauhaus
it
pours
a
clear
sallow
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
microfoam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
flowers
and
rice
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
along
with
a
strong
undercurrent
of
mineralrich
water
which
somehow
helps
things
a
bit
here
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
rather
crisp
finish
overall
despite
the
great
pilsner
feel
this
thing
just
was
too
meek
and
sappy
to
be
taken
seriously
as
a
pils
shame
really
good
crisp
warm
weather
beer
ive
had
way
too
many
better
pilsners
to
grab
this
often
glad
i
got
a
sixer
though
the
carbonation
is
not
as
sharp
as
it
is
on
most
good
pilsners
i
dont
find
it
to
be
a
detriment
here
because
the
softer
mouthfeel
in
addition
to
the
flavor
profile
makes
this
beer
very
food
friendly
overall
that
food
friendliness
and
vibrant
fruit
character
makes
this
a
good
change
of
pace
from
other
pilsners
id
happily
drink
this
again
beer
is
awesome
overall
it
is
quite
good
very
drinkable
wet
up
front
with
a
mild
malt
sweetness
mild
yeastiness
in
the
midpalate
clean
finish
awesome
beer
truly
great
one
of
the
greats
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
crisp
served
cold
and
finishes
clean
well
constructed
yet
the
corn
notes
are
a
bit
too
prevalent
give
it
a
try
golden
yellow
quite
clear
big
ole
fluffy
head
some
toasted
malt
earthy
grassy
and
citrus
hops
pretty
solid
bitterness
wellbalanced
with
the
maltiness
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
too
good
flavor
the
grassy
hops
start
becoming
really
evident
halfway
through
the
beer
with
the
toasty
malt
quality
330ml

2
oz
into
a
snifter
large
head
with
ok
retention
and
lacing
on
top
of
a
pale
pils
body
appropriate
for
the
style
good
funk
in
the
nose
not
the
whiffiest
pils
ive
ever
had
but
nothing
objectionable
and
a
respectable
hop
and
malt
profile
for
the
style
clean
refreshing
taste
with
yeast
characteristics
coming
through
well
its
not
mind
blowing
or
anything
but
it
is
a
good
session
pilsener
that
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
drinking
anytime
nice
easy
drinking
pils
dry
clean
finish
not
a
lot
of
head
retention
compared
to
other
german
pilsners
very
refreshing
with
just
enough
bitterness
i
do
agree
with
others
reviewers
who
say
it
could
have
a
little
more
oomph
but
nonetheless
a
good
beer
d
solid
german
pils
like
most
you
can
put
back
a
bunch
could
use
a
little
more
umph
to
set
itself
apart
dvery
drinkable
and
a
tasty
pils
low
abv
is
a
plus
seems
like
something
that
would
be
much
better
in
germany
rather
than
canned
pasteurized
and
flown
here
for
it
to
sit
on
the
shelf
god
knows
how
long
before
someone
purchases
it
not
bad
though
for
2
a
pint
dr
highly
priced
by
berlin
standards
and
not
particularly
good
stick
to
the
czechs
for
your
pilseners
lads
and
leave
this
tap
untouched
mmmm
i
could
go
for
some
german
sausages
now
this
is
an
awesome
beer
i
think
we
have
a
high
quality
brewing
process
coupled
with
great
ingredients
here
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
fine
pils
up
there
with
starkenberger
pils
or
schweiger
pils
and
in
the
highest
german
tradition
of
a
pilsener
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
nice
bright
yellow
with
a
small
head
aroma
of
grass
and
hay
fields
with
a
touch
of
dry
biscuits
flavor
is
again
dry
and
grassy
with
a
great
bitterness
this
is
a
great
clean
drinking
pilsner
a
good
pilsner
needs
to
clean
your
palate
everytime
and
make
you
crave
that
bittnerness
this
one
does
just
that
this
is
a
beer
that
needs
to
be
in
your
fridge
yearround
md
medium
body
does
not
leave
the
mouth
feeling
overly
dry
seltzerlike
prickle
of
carbonation
in
the
back
of
the
mouth
very
easy
drinking
beer
highly
sessionable
pairs
well
with
many
food
varieties
light
body
and
carbonation
very
drinkable
an
excellent
go
to
pilsner
overall
it
was
alright
above
average
barely
and
not
really
worth
a
revisit
clean
quality
budget
brew
needs
a
touch
more
flavor
but
i
can
easily
swallow
a
gallon
of
this
t
very
light
body
bitter
taste
sort
of
metalic
not
sweet
notes
not
a
very
clean
beer
another
easy
drinking
pils
a
good
example
of
this
style
wellmade
incredibly
easy
to
drink
cheap
as
all
get
out
at
the
lcbo
making
this
along
with
urquell
my
standard
pilsner
pickups
at
maybe
20
cents
a
can
more
than
canadian
and
budweiser
this
one
is
one
wellworth
stocking
up
for
the
summer
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
quite
refreshing
and
goes
down
very
quickly
it
really
opens
up
your
palate
so
it
is
a
good
choice
to
start
out
with
watch
out
this
is
a
werewolf
in
sheeps
clothing
kind
of
reminds
me
of
kölsch
which
is
not
good
for
a
german
pils
though
its
definitely
not
the
best
out
there
its
also
not
the
worst
drinkability
this
is
a
topclass
pils
this
is
an
easydrinking
refresher
that
doesnt
compromise
on
flavor
d
its
an
average
tasting
beer
but
when
you
combine
that
with
it
being
light
bodied
and
a
5
abv
it
leaves
it
pretty
drinkable
id
find
it
more
desirable
if
it
didnt
have
a
grainy
finishaftertaste
d
an
alright
pilsener
not
a
standout
d
very
good
pilsener
that
is
easy
going
would
definitely
recommend
it

nothing

it

quaff
i
am
happy
i
tried
this
but
it
didnt
really
impress
me
maybe
a
good
session
beer
after
a
long
bike
ride
that
is
when
it
tastes
best
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
it
down
a
notch
as
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
weak
in
flavor
overall
i
agree
with
the
reviewer
who
said
that
this
would
be
good
with
spicy
food
i
drank
it
alone
and
found
it
to
be
pretty
pleasing
not
overwhelmingly
good
but
a
pretty
solid
pilsner
nonetheless
i
would
recommend
it
and
would
be
curious
to
try
it
on
tap
d
drinkability
slightly
hurt
by
the
finish
but
a
decent
beer
seems
like
it
could
cut
spicy
foods
well
d
a
pretty
nice
german
pilsener
looking
for
a
straight
up
everyday
pils
here
it
is
quite
sweet
on
the
nose
one
feels
a
little
alcohol
and
sweet
fruity
white
wine
with
a
fairly
dry
on
the
palate
it
is
little
appreciated
there
is
also
a
bitter
and
unsavory
side
where
the
resin
represented
by
white
grapes
or
even
hides
them
displace
a
hop
unappetizing
not
really
good
in
the
mouth
this
beer
is
even
still
in
the
niche
for
pure
thirst
one
of
umpteen
beers
that
are
drinkable
but
offers
nothing
to
seperate
itself
from
the
pack
drinkability
the
ontap
version
of
this
beer
i
remember
being
so
much
better
than
the
bottled
version
id
love
to
have
this
fresh
overall
an
easy
drinking
beverage
that
i
wouldnt
mind
keeping
in
my
fridge
this
is
one
of
the
local
beers
and
i
am
probably
a
little
biased
but
really
the
best
pilsner
ever
one
can
drink
all
night
and
wake
up
early
for
work
so
pure
and
delicious
like
bread
on
the
tongue
and
a
great
slight
barley
malt
aftertaste
that
demands
futher
drinking
when
poured
properly
in
the
proper
glass
this
beer
forms
an
amazing
rocky
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leaves
beautiful
lacing
its
rare
to
find
a
pils
with
such
a
great
head
the
smell
is
a
very
mild
yet
spicy
hops
and
bread
dough
tickle
the
nose
hairs
carbonation
is
perfect
delicate
bitterness
that
again
demans
further
drinking
as
it
teases
the
senses
and
one
must
have
more
this
beer
is
a
must
for
all
pilsner
fans
i
suggest
anyone
who
visits
dresden
or
radeberg
try
the
zwickelbier
on
tap
as
well
its
more
bitter
with
an
unfiltered
thickness
that
remains
me
of
franziskaner
like
a
pilsnerweissbier
mix
draft
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
a
dull
golden
color
clarity
isnt
great
and
the
head
drops
off
fairly
fast
the
aroma
is
grassy
herbal
mildly
sweet
with
floral
and
honey
undertones
initially
malty
and
bready
on
the
palate
this
is
a
bit
sweet
for
a
pils
and
the
hop
flavors
are
delicate
floral
lightly
grassy
in
the
finish
theres
very
little
bitterness
or
bite
and
it
doesnt
dry
up
as
much
as
id
like
decent
overall
but
i
prefer
the
more
crisp
and
hoppy
pilsners
d
very
easy
to
drink
could
drink
a
few
in
no
time
drinkability
inexpensive
and
not
bad
would
buy
again
d
a
german
pilsener
for
the
ages
at
just
under
5
abv
this
pils
has
the
integrity
of
a
classic
example
of
this
style
and
is
perfectly
boring
its
not
bad
and
if
you
love
a
good
pils
this
is
as
good
as
youll
get
great
balance
light
body
and
ample
flavor
drink
i
think
this
is
a
fantastic
pilsner
definitely
sessionable
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
another
good
example
of
a
pilsner
dcould
drink
this
all
day
on
a
hot
summer
day
very
drinkable
and
can
hold
its
own
against
any
beer
in
this
category
so
if
you
are
looking
for
a
true
german
pilz
here
ya
go
prost
d
yes
i
will
grab
another
this
is
highly
drinkable
and
pleasant
i
would
gladly
give
it
to
friends
that
are
used
to
pilsners
and
to
my
dad
and
uncle
who
love
them
too
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
hop
presence
that
offsets
the
sweetness
resulting
in
a
wonderfully
balanced
pilsner
finishes
clean
with
a
lingering
light
hoppiness
i
really
liked
this
pilsner
a
lot
one
of
the
best
ive
had
ill
definitely
buy
more
of
this
one
mouthfeel
is
light
with
a
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
d
very
easy
to
drink
indeed
looks
really
good
clear
golden
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
sticks
all
the
way
down
the
glass
smell
is
aromatic
herbs
and
bitters
a
decent
wallop
of
dryness
for
the
taste
it
stays
upper
palette
and
lasts
for
quite
a
while
turning
even
more
bitter
at
the
end
but
a
hint
of
base
sweetness
adds
some
needed
balance
but
it
needs
more
carbonated
well
glad
i
tried
it
but
id
rather
select
another
brand
of
german
pils
note
had
this
on
tap
a
month
ago
and
remembered
it
having
more
hop
character
still
not
a
bad
session
pilsner
d
a
classic
example
of
a
northgerman
pils
drinkability
probably
a
decent
german
pils
but
im
just
not
used
to
the
better
ones
maybe
a
little
too
prevalent
of
an
aftertaste
for
repeated
trips
to
the
fridge
but
a
decent
german
pils
d
super
easy
to
drink
this
would
be
a
pretty
sessionable
beer
if
not
for
the
price
definitely
not
the
best
pilsener
out
there
but
it
is
more
than
decent
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
beer
again
but
i
wouldnt
avoid
it
either
there
must
have
been
a
miscommunication
between
the
brewery
and
its
brewer
they
asked
him
to
brew
an
authentic
german
pilsner
and
he
brewed
a
plainold
euro
lager
although
it
was
a
confident
very
drinkable
effort
a
beer
this
bland
and
toneless
frankly
does
not
speak
to
the
distinguished
and
esteemed
tradition
of
german
pilsners
d
easy
drinking
and
tasty
ive
enjoyed
some
pilsners
more
disappointing
clearly
an
unfresh
or
somewhat
skunked
bottle
but
also
seems
to
lack
the
right
floral
notes
and
balance
would
like
to
taste
a
good
fresh
one
to
see
if
the
shipping
is
to
blame
but
this
bottled
sample
was
a
bummer
a
little
too
hearty
to
drown
yourself
in
still
its
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
lightened
the
body
enough
to
support
its
uniquely
bold
flavor
it
has
a
crisp
lightbody
its
a
refreshingly
dry
classic
northern
german
pilsner
overall
its
a
drinkable
beer
though
i
didnt
realize
it
was
going
to
be
this
hoppy
before
purchasing
it
just
saw
it
on
the
shelf
and
noticed
that
i
havent
had
that
one
yet
dont
think
i
would
drink
more
than
one
at
one
sitting
though
prost
drinkability
is
pretty
decent
my
only
complaint
is
that
is
gets
more
muddled
as
it
warms
which
causes
it
to
seem
a
little
bland
other
than
that
its
around
average
overall
a
good
clean
german
pilsner
i
think
its
one
that
i
needed
to
sit
down
and
review
to
appreciate
its
qualities
because
i
could
see
myself
thinking
this
is
just
another
beer
if
i
was
drinking
from
a
can
with
friends
of
the
three
pilseners
ive
had
tonight
this
one
looks
the
best
with
the
fairest
golden
color
the
tallest
and
most
structured
white
head
and
the
best
head
retention
nice
aroma
as
well
with
some
really
pleasant
almost
ryelike
whole
grain
notes
graham
crackery
sweetness
and
subtle
cressish
hops
nicely
fresh
and
grainy
flavour
as
well
kinda
like
chewing
on
a
kernel
of
barley
malt
and
all
the
sweetness
and
tang
that
ensues
sharp
but
not
too
sharp
hops
with
a
flavor
of
hay
and
lemon
rind
balance
things
out
and
contribute
to
an
overall
refreshing
character
emphasised
by
a
dry
finish
and
full
carbonation
a
very
nice
robust
german
pilsener
that
could
just
about
be
called
exemplary
d
very
drinkable
nothing
really
stands
out
but
this
is
a
really
high
quality
beer
that
relies
on
the
ingredients
and
brewing
art
just
as
it
should
be
im
not
sure
what
caused
me
to
pick
up
radeberger
pilsner
for
the
first
time
but
im
glad
i
did
very
refreshing
this
is
a
good
pils
and
definitely
can
be
a
good
session
beer
ive
got
a
cold
so
rating
the
smell
is
a
bit
tough
but
the
flavor
is
there
sharp
and
crisp
with
a
very
good
golden
color
pours
a
good
thick
head
and
the
lacing
is
pretty
good
definitely
would
buy
again
as
many
pils
ive
had
lately
miss
the
mark
pours
very
pale
gold
no
haze
and
a
large
white
creamy
head
that
retains
nicely
at
first
but
recedes
to
a
thin
layer
laces
well
too
nose
has
some
light
skunk
faint
herbal
hops
and
a
cerealmalty
component
the
clean
malty
component
comes
through
on
the
palate
with
lightly
herbal
hops
near
the
end
and
onto
the
finish
all
in
all
a
beer
you
can
sit
down
and
enjoy
a
few
for
sure
give
it
a
try
if
you
want
something
that
is
smooth
and
tasty
overall
an
ok
german
pils
this
just
goes
to
show
you
or
me
just
how
different
a
beer
can
taste
and
feel
depending
on
what
youve
had
beforehand
d
very
drinkable
i
could
toss
more
than
a
few
of
these
back
great
with
some
beer
battered
chicken
mmmm
this
is
a
good
german
pilsner
beer
it
is
light
in
color
and
in
light
in
body
but
is
very
refreshing
and
tasty
excellent
served
chilled
this
beer
is
a
good
companion
to
german
foods
and
i
have
found
it
to
be
very
well
paired
with
japanese
sushi
i
enjoyed
this
beer
very
much
it
is
hard
to
find
a
good
pilsner
sinkability
ive
got
much
better
things
to
do
in
my
life
than
finish
this
dud
the
taste
is
of
distinctly
bitter
and
earthly
hops
and
a
grain
flavor
the
whole
way
through
with
a
bit
of
citrus
mouthfeel
is
light
and
wellcarbonated
adds
up
to
a
decent
session
beer
especially
65
cents
plus
pfand
for
half
a
liter
but
nothing
too
memorable
mouthfeeldrink
light
to
medium
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
nice
pilsner
could
drink
barrels
of
this
stuff
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
just
an
extremely
well
made
german
pils
served
from
a
500ml
bottle
pours
a
pale
medium
gold
with
a
moderate
head
it
quickly
dissipates
but
it
leaves
impressive
lacing
on
glass
smell
is
very
faint
malty
character
and
while
inoffensive
its
definitely
underwhelming
taste
is
slightly
offputting
with
not
much
character
but
also
an
odd
dryness
or
bitterness
that
lingers
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
among
my
favorites
of
the
style
d
pretty
easy
drinking
but
the
taste
detracts
from
this
for
me
not
one
i
would
i
go
back
to
d
high
keep
em
coming
i
can
drink
these
all
day
long
light
enough
to
session
with
just
enough
flavor
to
cut
through
many
a
food
pairing
i
really
like
this
beer
not
as
hopforward
as
some
of
the
us
pilsners
but
it
is
great
in
its
own
right
poured
from
a
500ml
tall
can
into
a
pint
glass
clear
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
grainy
hoppy
aroma
bitter
taste
with
some
spicy
hops
decent
mouthfeel
and
well
carbonated
dry
finish
not
a
bad
pilsner
id
enjoy
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
growler
pour
from
deciccios
in
ardsley
ny
this
one
flows
out
quite
clear
light
near
straw
capped
by
a
near
white
puffed
up
head
tiny
bubble
film
sheeting
ring
and
slippery
fine
lace
unexciting
nose
just
a
hint
of
grass
and
lime
clean
tasting
pils
german
hops
crisp
and
dry
some
more
light
lime
and
an
unremarkable
finish
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
d
i
bought
a
case
of
these
at
costco
i
had
a
few
and
didnt
touch
the
rest
of
them
until
i
had
company
coming
over
and
i
put
them
out
my
guests
seemed
ok
with
it
but
i
honestly
dont
think
i
would
buy
this
again
nicely
drinkable
i
would
dub
this
the
second
most
drinkable
pilsner
at
work
sure
its
not
saying
much
but
its
good
doverall
i
would
say
this
is
by
far
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
with
dinner
it
seems
to
compliment
almost
any
style
of
food
and
quenches
your
thirst
while
inspiring
your
ba
side
excellent
pils
was
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
a
fresh
case
at
costco
as
part
of
their
autumnal
offerings
this
is
a
very
good
nononsense
german
pilsner
i
poured
this
into
a
nonstem
pils
glass
but
with
foil
wrapper
below
the
cap
this
beer
is
perfect
to
drink
from
the
13
liter
brown
bottle
although
the
golden
bubbles
are
fun
to
look
at
this
beer
is
unpretentiously
designed
to
be
consumed
happily
you
know
sometimes
a
good
beer
is
simply
that
flavor
is
slightly
bready
initially
clearing
out
quickly
as
the
sweet
malts
sweep
the
tongue
clean
and
finishing
with
viscous
citrus
notes
warming
allows
for
more
complexity
on
the
palate
and
a
softer
finish
carbonation
is
good
and
holds
steady
after
an
initial
release
of
gas
and
gives
a
good
feel
drink
is
good
but
kept
in
check
by
the
rich
body
of
the
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
as
it
should
be
the
texture
is
active
enough
to
cut
through
the
fat
of
the
bratwurst
on
its
own
it
seems
that
the
enormous
head
might
have
taken
some
wind
out
from
its
sails
definitely
a
great
food
pils
for
any
season
emphasizing
the
simple
and
real
ingredients
that
germany
has
to
offer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
several
other
beers
of
this
kind
that
i
would
pick
first
overall
i
found
this
beer
to
be
just
mediocre
the
aroma
was
typical
pils
grainyness
with
a
slight
skunk
scent
the
flavor
was
also
typical
for
the
style
guess
what
the
body
was
as
expected
for
the
style
as
well
the
drinkability
suffered
due
to
the
skunkieness
but
i
bet
having
this
close
to
the
source
would
be
a
treat
worth
trying
if
you
see
it
but
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
drinkability
excellent
a
wonderful
session
beer
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
and
one
that
i
enjoyed
consuming
but
it
cant
touch
my
bitburger
with
a
10
foot
pole
i
might
buy
it
again
but
probably
not
regularly
a
good
pilsner
d
pretty
drinkable
havent
had
it
on
tap
in
a
while
but
should
be
pretty
tasty
d
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
have
tasted
if
not
the
best
really
a
great
beer
i
would
like
to
find
radeberger
on
tap
somewhere
and
taste
it
at
it
freshest
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
i
have
come
across
and
with
a
relatively
low
abv
it
can
be
happily
enjoyed
as
a
session
beer
i
urge
people
to
try
this
as
i
think
it
is
easily
one
of
the
best
pilsners
in
the
world
md
sharp
crisp
and
very
nice
drinking
how
a
pilsner
should
be
d
alright
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
carbonated
on
the
higher
side
spiced
with
hops
on
tap
at
bukowskis
back
bay
served
in
a
tall
pilsener
glass
bright
yellow
color
with
a
very
clear
and
clean
body
tons
of
carbonation
smell
was
a
bit
musty
taste
was
a
very
crisp
barley
flavor
slight
vegetablelike
aftertaste
very
thin
beer
but
not
watery
i
would
say
that
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
quickly
not
overly
flavorful
but
a
nice
straight
forward
pils
that
you
can
pair
with
a
nice
sandwich
or
sit
and
drink
a
few
in
one
siting
a
fine
example
of
a
quality
german
lager
d
if
you
like
pils
you
owe
yourself
one
or
several
not
really
my
thing
but
i
have
to
respect
the
execution
and
would
have
no
problem
drinking
them
as
long
as
someone
felt
like
serving
it
to
me
pretty
good
for
a
beer
with
a
lot
of
words
on
the
bottle
i
cant
read
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
in
the
world
this
was
better
on
tap
in
berlin
germany
than
in
the
bottle
in
the
united
states
where
i
usually
have
it
had
a
halfliter
and
it
was
bright
clear
perfectly
carbonated
and
perfectly
bitter
i
could
drink
100
of
these
drinkability
average
abv
and
pleasant
taste
makes
this
highly
drinkable
for
me
cheers
do
an
easytodrink
german
pilsener
thats
much
better
than
most
of
the
popular
imports
but
not
quite
as
good
as
the
best
german
and
american
interpretations
of
the
style
regardless
this
is
still
a
fine
alternative
to
heineken
becks
amstel
etc
and
has
more
complexity
than
a
domestic
macro
its
light
refreshing
crisp
clean
and
quite
sessionable
it
also
should
appeal
to
most
domestic
and
mainstream
import
drinkers
review
from
notes
highly
recommended
a
pretty
rock
solid
german
pilsner
unless
you
completely
dispise
the
style
id
suggest
giving
it
a
try
md
mouthfeel
is
easy
and
has
a
mild
astringent
feel
from
the
hops
yeasty
on
the
end
with
nothing
foul
very
drinkable
but
not
for
the
price

this
is
a
really
good
session
beer
you
could
easily
drink
several
of
them
if
you
wanted
to
you
dont
feel
the
alcohol
a
fairly
drinkable
well
balanced
german
pils
like
its
brethren
there
is
only
so
much
you
can
say
about
these
offerings
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
more
than
a
few
of
these
in
a
tied
house
oktoberfestrelated
or
not

mild
everything
comes
through
light

a
moment

the
carbonation

a
bit
much
the
beer
seems
to
be
a
bit
better
as
it
get
warmer
though
could
definitely
see
myself
throwing
back
a
couple
of
these
and
i
did
on
a
regular
basis
when
im
not
trying
to
get
a
strong
buzz
looking
for
an
excellent
german
pils
try
this
one
drank
this
one
on
draft
in
nyc
at
lederhosen
very
tasty
light
brew
with
a
nice
aroma
decent
head
that
lasts
left
minor

very
drinkable
i
wish
we
could
get
this
one
in
upstate
new
york
in
draft
id
have
it
on
in
my
house
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
soapy
pure
white
head
that
slowly
settled
the
aroma
is
a
bit
grainy
and
grassy
a
dry
cracker
like
malt
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
of
a
grassy
stale
hop
very
light
lemon
a
metallic
twang
and
a
barely
there
malt
presence
the
feel
is
light
with
prickly
carbonation
has
a
bitter
presence
and
finish
could
be
a
little
crisper
drinks
very
easy
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
nice
spring
day
could
use
more
of
a
grassy
flavor
and
malt
presence
but
still
is
good
nice
clean
flavors
i
enjoyed
this
pils
very
much
could
easily
be
an
all
night
session
beer
the
taste
is
nice
malty
grain
yeasty
dough
with
strong
malty
sweetness
balanced
by
nice
pineherblemon
bitterness
its
smooth
and
rather
fullbodied
yet
lively
and
zesty
with
the
feel
and
taste
leaving
a
crisp
lightly
bitter
herbal
finish
great
german
pils
this
one
is
a
clear
golden
color
that
pours
a
pillowy
pure
white
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
though
it
doesnt
leave
a
lot
of
lacing
the
smell
is
more
than
i
expected
some
light
fruit
notes
with
a
mix
of
grains
and
hops
and
a
light
spicy
herbal
aroma
as
well
the
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
lightly
spicy
herbal
and
earthy
hops
with
light
malt
and
a
balanced
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
typical
pilsner
light
to
medium
body
crisp
and
clean
this
one
is
pleasantly
more
balanced
and
complex
than
i
expected
going
in
and
generally
quite
drinkable
kind
of
interesting
got
this
bottle
at
the
nearby
supermercado
disco
here
in
recoleta
buenos
aires
2nd
bottle
in
on
the
shelf
served
it
chilled
but
not
cold
poured
with
a
nice
white
head
that
went
down
to
a
light
partial
cover
and
some
lace
clear
gold
color
aroma
is
beery
a
faint
whiff
of
skunk
when
first
poured
some
malt
grass
grain
hop
and
light
fresh
sawdust
flavor
had
the
barest
hint
of
skunk
that
disappeared
right
away
not
too
bad
bitter
sweet
thing
but
the
sweetness
is
without
character
good
body
and
carbonation
drinkable
better
nearer
to
the
brewery
and
fresher
no
doubt
id
have
another
d
nice
german
pils
low
abv
is
a
bonus
i
normally
would
not
buy
a
bottle
so
far
out
of
date
was
0708
it
is
now
0309
but
for
2
bucks
what
the
heck
the
beer
didnt
seem
tired
at
all
but
maybe
a
bit
light
struck
a
very
pale
yellow
gold
color
with
a
modest
white
fizz
of
cover
and
similar
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
fairly
typical
clean
wheat
with
just
a
kiss
of
citrus
and
plenty
of
pumpernickel
bread
goodness
the
flavor
kicks
in
as
solid
pilsner
deep
bready
goodness
delicately
carbonated
a
chewy
body
feel
for
the
style
but
still
maintains
the
crisp
refreshing
drinkability
this
is
a
simple
tastey
treat
another
excellent
german
pilsner
definitely
worth
a
try
when
seeking
out
exports
i
look
for
the
good
before
dates
this
batch
i
tried
was
about
7
months
out
from
that
date
etched
on
the
bottles
wrapper
this
is
the
best
german
pilsner
i
think
ive
ever
had
the
appearance
and
smell
are
very
nice
and
the
taste
did
not
let
me
down
overall
a
very
fresh
hopsy
taste
not
too
bitter
or
sweet
a
fine
body
i
cant
wait
to
try
this
excellent
german
pilsner
again
nice
looking
better
than
average
pilsner
its
a
light
golden
beer
with
a
big
creamy
white
head
it
smells
and
tastes
fairly
fresh
and
clean
the
malt
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
the
bitter
finish
is
spicy
and
crisp
my
only
real
criticism
is
that
it
doesnt
quite
stand
out
but
then
im
not
the
most
refined
connoisseur
of
european
lagers
there
are
some
floral
and
citric
hops
with
some
light
vegetable
tone
its
a
very
solid
beer
but
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
at
any
rate
its
a
good
beer
golden
yellow
with
a
big
fat
sudsy
head
that
leaves
globs
of
lace
on
the
glass
grassy
noble
hops
dominate
the
nose
with
some
bread
dough
and
lemon
tastes
much
like
the
nose
would
indicate
grassy
hop
bitterness
balanced
nicely
with
a
light
citrusy
graininess
light
on
the
palate
and
easy
drinking
finishes
dry
refreshing
not
my
taste
very
hard
to
be
fair
i
was
told
that
this
is
typical
of
german
pilsners
almost
tasted
stale
and
skunky
to
me
might
me
my
noobish
taste
buds
please
go
to
other
reviews
for
the
time
being
overall
this
was
a
great
starter
beer
before
a
meal
wont
overshadow
food
and
could
be
a
great
session
beer
anytime
or
terrific
for
hot
summer
days
drinkability
very
drinkable
i
would
definitely
pour
another
of
these
drinkability
a
good
sessionable
pils
that
will
pair
well
with
food
andor
hotter
weather
said
on
the
eve
of
the
seasons
biggest
winter
storm
due
tomorrow
night
yikes
notes
i
would
pick
this
up
way
more
often
if
i
could
find
it
easier
here
in
bg
as
it
is
i
had
to
go
to
the
big
city
30
mins
away
from
me
to
get
a
single
bottle
that
might
have
been
overpriced
but
ill
pick
it
up
again
every
once
and
a
while
when
i
pass
through
the
big
city
d
very
drinkable
very
easy
going
down
i
liked
this
as
it
wasnt
too
strong
in
any
area
and
was
very
drinkable
and
a
lower
amount
of
alcohol
d
an
authentic
german
pils
with
exceptional
drinkability
sunshine
and
a
fresh
six
pack
of
this
would
guarantee
a
pleasant
afternoon
my
thanks
go
out
for
the
fresh
beer
delivery
drinkability
i
enjoyed
this
particulary
because
its
got
more
character
then
alot
of
the
borings
pils
on
the
market
im
glad
i
tried
this
from
tap
d
while
its
not
as
good
as
a
pils
poured
in
germany
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
crisp
clean
and
malty
at
3
29
per
bottle
this
is
highly
recommended
this
is
a
typical
german
pils
clean
and
refreshing
and
a
great
compliment
to
the
darker
heavier
sauces
of
german
food
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
one
of
the
best
in
my
opinion
i
poured
this
one
out
of
the
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
nice
head
after
a
medium
pour
you
can
really
smell
the
hops
in
this
one
nice
and
inviting
this
is
truly
a
delicious
beer
goes
down
with
good
hop
bitterness
up
front
and
finishes
hoppy
and
crisp
delicious
drinkability
on
this
one
is
perfect
i
can
knock
these
back
all
night
truly
a
nice
beer
highly
recommended
md
good
amount
of
carbonation
and
not
too
fizzy
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
what
american
light
beers
should
be
definitely
a
step
above
your
average
german
pils
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
pils
it
brings
a
nice
hop
bite
for
the
style
first
thought
after
first
sip
oh
geez
now
thats
a
good
pilsner
loved
it
classic
german
pils
drink
it
cold
this
beer
does
fine
on
its
own
but
would
really
make
a
great
accompaniment
to
any
good
meal
its
like
water
but
better
not
that
they
really
compare
and
just
in
case
youre
not
a
ba
person
and
dont
know
what
a
pilsner
is
a
very
classic
american
pilsner
is
budweiser
which
i
happen
to
enjoy
but
would
take
the
radeberger
in
a
heart
beat
so
where
you
may
happen
to
enjoy
a
good
bud
consider
switching
to
a
radeberger
if
you
can
find
it
you
wont
regret
it
drinkability
is
good
for
a
warm
day
it
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
but
there
is
not
a
ton
of
crazy
flavor
or
taste
to
this
beer
fairly
average
had
on
tap
at
atwoods
the
drink
had
a
darkened
gold
look
with
some
great
lacing
on
the
side
awesome
aromas
with
some
good
yeasty
tones
and
a
herby
sweet
aroma
very
tasty
with
a
light
yeasty
and
bready
balance
the
mouthfeel
i
must
say
was
excellent
and
perfect
wickedly
crisp
and
refreshing
was
really
a
treat
drinking
overall
a
really
really
good
pilsener
next
summer
prima
pils
will
have
to
share
some
space
with
this
one
i
am
not
saying
the
two
are
on
the
same
leveljust
that
this
was
good
enough
to
get
a
shot
in
the
rotation
pretty
much
has
good
quality
macro
lager
written
all
over
it
not
all
that
unlike
a
cross
between
bud
and
canned
heineken
and
perhaps
slightly
better
overall
i
was
impressed
by
this
beer
the
thickness
is
the
biggest
thing
very
solid
for
a
pilsener
definitely
worth
a
shot
overallvery
well
made
german
pilsner
a
highlight
of
the
style
nice
flavor
nice
balance
and
nice
drinkability
a
great
job
american
brewers
should
take
notice
wtf
is
earth
shattering
this
is
a
lovely
beer
regardless
of
its
lack
of
earth
shattering
potential
its
highly
drinkable
with
a
wonderful
german
maltiness
covered
up
nicely
by
firm
bitterness
bitterness
is
definitely
in
the
mouth
feel
as
well
a
masterpiece
in
the
brewing
arts
d
good
drinkability
good
to
style
and
very
nice
to
consume
goes
down
nicely
and
one
that
is
enjoyable
d
this
is
probably
my
favorite
pilsner
i
have
tried
thus
far
the
taste
is
quite
crisp
a
bit
grassy
there
is
some
spiciness
to
the
beer
in
the
finish
and
a
bit
of
a
floral
taste
almost
perfumey
in
the
mid
section
the
spicey
florals
hang
on
into
the
finish
and
beyond
the
beer
is
quite
carbonated
light
bodied
refreshing
but
im
knocking
the
mouthfeel
down
a
few
notches
because
of
the
florals
that
linger
way
too
long
d
a
pretty
drinkable
beer
fairly
good
example
of
a
pilsner
a
nice
summer
beer
as
well
as
a
decent
session
beer
d
this
is
a
killer
pils
it
does
everything
right
for
the
style
and
nothing
wrong
in
any
department
this
well
rounded
pils
is
one
of
the
best
out
there
honestly
it
may
not
stun
anyone
with
outlandish
hops
or
spice
but
its
just
a
damn
good
beer
this
is
a
good
if
not
world
shattering
german
pilsner
pours
a
beautiful
yellow
with
a
large
fluffy
head
the
aroma
is
sprightly
and
lemony
with
a
little
sweetness
the
flavor
is
smooth
and
surprisingly
complex
though
distinctively
pilsner
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
lemony
character
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
has
a
nice
carbonation
bite
delicious
and
refreshing
pours
a
clear
light
straw
yellow
with
a
huge
fluffy
white
head
that
holds
very
well
with
lots
of
lace
smells
of
corn
and
husk
and
earth
taste
is
clean
and
fresh
with
a
good
hop
balance
and
a
dry
finish
light
and
refreshing
keeps
you
wanting
the
next
one
will
be
looking
for
it
again
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
retention
the
aroma
is
grainy
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
extremely
crisp
and
refreshing
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
malt
and
finishes
with
a
quick
spicy
hop
finish
leaving
you
craving
the
next
sip
this
beer
accomplished
everything
i
was
looking
for
it
is
highly
drinkable
and
packs
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
from
getting
bored
very
sessionable
in
the
warmer
summer
months
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
german
pilsner
that
is
recommended
recommended
bright
clear
yellow
with
a
huge
sticky
pure
white
head
the
smell
is
faint
light
grain
and
soft
floral
hops
very
nice
the
taste
is
again
light
grain
bittered
with
floral
hoppiness
light
and
pretty
clean
finish
is
pretty
dry
with
just
a
hint
of
lingering
grain
and
spicy
hop
bite
maybe
a
bit
too
sticky
in
the
finish
just
not
clean
enough
for
my
taste
overall
quite
good
hard
to
beat
on
a
bright
sunny
day
after
long
day
at
work
id
have
it
again
if
this
is
the
only
choice
for
pilsner
its
still
a
good
one
pours
a
brilliant
pale
yellow
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
a
little
lacing
in
my
pilsn
glass
not
a
strong
smell
cereal
grains
and
some
herbal
hop
a
crisp
taste
bready
malts
well
balanced
w
spicy
noble
hop
bitterness
nice
clean
finish
a
fairly
dry
lightbodied
brew
w
a
decent
level
of
co2
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
an
excellent
pilsner
ill
be
sure
to
pick
up
more
of
this
one
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
booooring
very
easy
drinking
and
great
tasting
this
beer
lends
itself
to
drinking
with
a
low
abv
and
a
light
body
if
you
can
get
this
fresh
definately
try
one
the
beer
has
a
best
before
date
on
the
back
label
pours
straw
yellow
and
very
clear
with
a
nice
light
bright
white
head
carbonation
is
assertive
but
on
point
for
style
smells
of
husky
grains
and
noble
hops
this
is
a
well
above
average
german
pils
that
is
clean
and
crisp
with
just
the
right
bitterness
to
grain
sweetness
balance
dry
and
drinkable
as
it
should
be
a
bit
heavy
handed
on
the
carbonation
and
combined
with
the
hops
this
numbs
the
tongue
a
bit
not
bad
but
i
can
find
better
examples
of
a
german
pils
truly
an
above
averge
beer
with
great
drinkability
drinkability
is
very
solid
i
could
see
myself
at
a
summer
bbq
having
a
few
of
these
over
the
course
of
the
day
while
eating
some
good
eats
d
easy
drinker
but
there
are
a
lot
of
local
pilsners
that
are
fresher
and
i
would
even
prefer
a
warsteiner
you
can
drink
it
though
thats
not
a
problem
a
very
pretty
clear
golden
amber
rather
appealing
aroma
is
typical
of
this
kind
of
beer
but
strong
flavor
is
full
malty
crisp
average
for
a
pilsner
except
richer
than
most
and
not
watery
texture
is
smooth
and
lively
and
the
aftertaste
has
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
great
drinkability
this
is
a
very
easydrinking
german
pilsener
most
of
these
lighter
lagers
are
very
underrated
on
ba
and
certainly
arent
as
good
as
some
beers
with
more
flavour
and
edginess
but
as
representatives
of
their
styles
they
are
very
tasty
d
very
nice
quaffer
and
quite
sessionable
at
4
8
drinkability
crisp
and
refreshing
very
sessionable

you

a

the
professor
and
i
went
to
a
local
restaurant
and
enjoyed
sandwiches
and
a

pitchers
of

not

it
pours
a
clumpy
thick
white
head
a
couple
fingers
thick
atop
a
light
golden
body
with
the
head
modestly
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
tall
mug
the
nose
is
quiet
with
a
good
whiff
of
hops
same
with
the
taste
for
certain
with
a
nice
bitterness
coating
the
tongue
were
it
not
for
driving
in
some
snow
i
would
have
had
more
than
one
in

not
spectacular

a
pretty
decent

there

nothing
to

better
than

swill

crisp
and
refreshing
with

tastes
i
will
definitely
revisit
this
beer
again
a
passable
lager
but
not
really
a
pilsner
to
my
taste
buds
i
had
been
expecting
at
least
a
pilsner
urquell
but
this
doesnt
get
there
dont
buy
in
quantity
drinkability
a
pilsner
with
little
to
offer
and
lacking
much
of
an
identity
of
its
own
it
was
hard
to
get
too
excited
about
it
when
victory
prima
was
also
readily
available
served
out
of
a
radeberger
pilsner
mug
with
a
nice
head
of
foam
on
the
top
it
went
down
with
a
decent
aftertaste
nice
golden
color
and
body
a
beer
that
would
be
good
if
you
are
not
in
the
mood
for
something
heavy
but
dont
want
to
drink
a
macro
overall
a
decent
beer
as
far
as
pilsners
go
this
one
is
fine
high
quality
good
substance
to
it
d
a
nice
german
pilsener
that
goes
down
easy
and
would
please
anyone
looking
for
that
authentic
pilsener
flavour
because
of
its
light
body
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
but
i
quite
enjoyed
sipping
it
trying
to
figure
out
its
flavours
nothing
outstanding
but
an
enjoyable
taste
experience
i
would
definitely
buy
this
one
again
light
spice
and
mild
herbs
and
pine
come
at
you
thru
the
nose
on
this
one
all
going
down
refreshinly
crispwith
some
bitterness
hitting
your
tongue
quite
wella
hint
of
fermentation
as
it
goes
down
your
throatquite
easily
consumednot
a
bad
beer
at
all
easy
to
drink
and
would
be
quite
enjoyable
on
hot
summer
days
well
worth
a
try
radeberger
pilsner
saw
it
on
sale
for
6
99
a
six
pack
and
thought
what
could
i
lose
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
soapy
head
lots
of
carbonation
smells
pretty
clean
like
a
good
german
pilsner
just
a
hint
of
skunk
crackery
malt
with
a
gentle
hoppy
bite
no
skunkiness
detected
on
the
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
smooth
clean
and
simple
overall
im
impressed
with
the
lasting
head
and
lacing
as
i
work
my
way
down
a
good
imported
pilsner
and
at
6
99
a
six
pack
its
deffinately
worth
a
try
but
whats
up
with
the
11
2
ounce
bottles
overall
a
pretty
nice
pils
it
is
good
tasting
light
and
refreshing
light
and
body
and
crisp
too
not
bad
for
a
more
mainstream
pilsner
overall
not
my
favorite
pilsner
not
nearly
as
flavorfull
as
pilsner
urquell
but
a
decent
german
style
pilsner
that
will
easily
find
its
way
to
porches
and
patios
over
the
days
of
summer
and
fall
taste
is
pretty
bitter
hoppy
and
has
no
real
yeast
taste
like
sulfur
or
anything
the
malt
is
fresh
and
pilsnerlike
not
the
most
exciting
beer
ever
but
decent
overall
a
boring
pilsener
no
news
no
special
characteristic
dont
deserve
a
higher
grade
d
another
drinkable
german
pils
nothing
to
blow
you
away
just
a
good
drinkable
refreshing
lager
beer
as
for
drinkability
this
was
a
smooth
flavorful
and
easydrinking
pilsener
though
it
may
lack
the
hop
bitterness
and
lively
carbonation
that
some
of
its
counterparts
possess
it
is
nevertheless
a
refreshing
beer
perfect
for
summer
barbecues
well
its
got
the
bitterness
down
but
the
malt
profile
and
hops
flavor
leave
something
to
be
desired
it
did
have
a
little
nice
lacing
and
it
was
a
proper
light
gold
still
the
aroma
was
too
faint
as
were
the
grains
and
spicy
flavors
of
the
hops
still
not
a
bad
beer
i
enjoyed
it
on
a
hot
day
will
certainly
take
the
time
to
search
this
one
out
again
poured
a
clear
gold
color
very
heavy
carbonation
nose
was
clear
and
slightly
malty
something
was
of
with
the
flavor
like
wet
paper
tasted
like
i
was
licking
a
stamp
light
mouthfeel
just
a
tad
sourish
for
wahtever
reason
i
could
just
not
wrap
myself
around
this
beer
thebartender
told
me
it
was
a
fresh
keg
but
i
was
unable
to
ignore
the
paper
flavor
drinkability
one
of
my
two
go
to
pils
this
and
warsteiner
cant
beat
the

deal
at
the

served
in
a
pint
glass
flimsy
white
head
sits
on

of
a
nice
clear
golden
straw
pils
no
head

whatsoever
smells
of
spicy
hops
and
somewhat
fresh
grains
medium
body
with
a
crisp
hop
flavor
at
first
hop
flavor
rolls
into
a
nice
bitter
stage
and
then
finishes
off
with
a
bit
of
sweet
malty
gain
flavor
almost
biscuity
not
quite
as
herbal
or
fresh
tasting
as
i
would
like
but
certainly
not
bad
by
any
means
very
drinkable
as
well
a
few
of
these
soothed
my
stomach
just
fine
after
a
very
large
meal
very
carbonated
with
decent
head
head
retention
slightly
stronger
yellow
than
most
pilsners
ive
seen
nothing
remarkable
about
the
aroma
taste
or
mouthfeel
just
better
than
most
american
pilsners
ive
tried
i
didnt
have
any
problem
getting
it
down
but
then
again
pilsner
is
not
my
favorite

mouthfeel
and
drinkability
better
than
recollection
upon
recent
tasting
sickly
yellow
i
was
actually
amazed
at
how
clear
light
this
beer
was
the
head
was
nice
and
long
lasting
it
had
good
carbonation
very
balanced
the
taste
was
another
story
though
amazingly
bitter
for
pilsner
yet
didnt
have
any
outstanding
flavor
profiles
to
speak
of
that
could
make
up
for
it
there
are
hundreds
of
german
pilsners
no
reason
to
settle
for
this
one
d
drinkable
i
just
dont
like
pilsners
an
easy
to
drink
good
german
pils
but
nothing
good
enough
to
really
seperate
itself
from
an
already
crowded
pack
not
bad
nice
bit
of
bitterness
for
a
pilsner
worth
a
try
in
general
not
a
good
german
pils
poor
king
frederick
august
iii
of
saxony
i
hope
he
had
better
drinks
than
this
to
console
his
abdicating
soul
why
scored
so
high
my
radegerger
was
delivered
to
me
by
my
roomates
houseguest
who
just
flew
in
from
berlin
two
days
ago
eight
hours
on
a
plane
sure
beats
2
weeks
on
a
boat
followed
by
uncounted
weeks
on
various
loading
docks
warehouses
and
a
retail
shelf
this
the
classic
taste
of
german
pilsner
that
i
remember
from
my
first
trip
there
14
years
ago
it
is
crisp
dry
a
little
soft
and
has
a
firm
light
malt
character
that
whispers
toast
or
crackers
beneath
a
delicate
minty
hop
flavor
and
aroma
balance
and
finesse
are
the
watchwords
of
the
style
as
these
beers
go
down
way
too
easily
and
recall
fond
memories
of
my
excursions
in
germany
where
i
intentionally
allowed
the
beers
to
follow
one
after
the
other
in
rapid
succession
the
golden
color
and
malty
aroma
beg
to
remind
me
of
the
long
walks
i
took
through
vast
wheat
fields
in
love
with
the
beer
that
soothed
the
hurt
for
the
german
girl
i
was
in
love
with
after
all
those
years
it
was
the
beer
that
stayed
true
in
the
nose
grassy
herbal
floral
and
mildly
spicy
hops
sway
atop
a
delicate
subtly
sweet
and
grainy
maltiness
its
medium
bodied
and
gently
crisp
in
the
mouth
leaving
it
to
lightly
tingle
the
tastebuds
before
it
warms
to
become
almost
creamy
smooth
the
flavor
is
fuller
than
the
nose
suggests
but
remains
the
same
with
the
addition
of
a
light
touch
of
lemon
amidst
the
grassy
gently
herbal
and
floral
hops
again
its
remarkably
wellbalanced
polished
even
an
excellent
gently
crisp
and
refreshing
pilsner
of
the
highest
caliber
the
taste
started
bitter
and
hoppy
before
yielding
to
a
malty
middle
it
ended
with
a
distinct
spiciness
and
i
was
impressed
with
how
harmoniously
the
different
flavours
worked
together
the
carbonation
was
high
in
keeping
with
the
style
but
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
sticky
for
my
liking
i
would
gladly
orderbuy
this
pilsner
again
subtle
and
fine
the
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
touch
of
butteryness
at
the
end
not
a
whole
lot
of
complexity
happening
here
the
drinkablity
is
high
but
the
flavor
is
somewhat
lacking
i
truly
like
a
good
pils
but
this
one
is
average
at
best
gold
color
clear

minimal
white
head
nose
is
sour
grassy
cereal
melon
hopps
and
detergent
taste
of
sour
bitter
grassy
hops
and
wet
hay

dry
harsh
mouth
feel
for
a
light
beer

sour
cereal
and
grass
aftertaste
nothing
special
for
a
pilsner
everything
about
this
pilsner
was
sort
of
average
the
color
was
an
average
yellow
and
with
some
foam
and
very
little
lace
of
the
glass
the
smell
was
pleasant
and
not
over
powering
the
taste
was
pleasant
with
just
enough
of
bitterness
as
to
not
overpower
the
average
hop
taste
great
quincher
on
a
hot
day
and
cold
day
too
little
better
than
average
taste
than
other
pilsners
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
towering
and
firm
white
head
its
an
attractive
and
impressive
pilsner
appearance
the
aroma
is
a
little
weak
but
presents
an
initial
shot
of
floral
and
slightly
herbal
hops
backed
with
a
hint
of
grain
the
beer
could
have
used
a
dose
of
malt
aroma
and
certainly
more
intensity
in
the
hops
the
flavor
is
pretty
tasty
with
a
little
sweetness
up
front
the
centerpiece
of
the
beer
is
certainly
the
hops
which
are
a
little
more
pronounced
in
the
taste
the
finish
is
a
little
bitter
and
pretty
clean
fairly
high
carbonation
and
lighttomedium
body
all
in
all
this
is
a
drinkable
and
respectable
german
beer
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
appealing
to
look
at
like
most
german
pils
rather
good
head
retention
i
felt
as
i
find
some
pils
to
retain
no
head
at
all
from
the
bottle
hoppy
taste
does
not
linger
too
long
in
the
mouth
which
may
make
if
forgetable
however
the
medium
level
of
carbonation
is
easy
on
the
stomach
making
this
pils
a
nice
example
of
the
german
style
and
easy
enough
to
have
a
few
standard
and
typical
of
german
pilsners
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
standout
is
a
heaping
helping
of
saaz
earthy
hops
though
the
malt
profile
is
moderate
more
grain
flavors
than
malt
sweetness
persists
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
the
look
is
a
very
clear
moderately
carbonated
and
retented
foamstand
feels
fairly
smooth
but
not
with
the
pilsner
creamy
texture
that
i
wanted
leaving
the
grain
profile
to
come
across
a
bit
astringent
grain
hulls
finishes
pretty
clean
overall
with
a
light
grain
and
hop
lingering
undoubtedly
a
good
beer
to
pair
with
a
weinerschnitzel
dinner
first
taste
is
a
bit
muddled
a
slight
metallic
twang
presides
which
is
a
bit
offputting
a
nutty
maltiness
and
a
lot
of
alcohol
for
a
4
8
beer
strong
hop
presence
that
becomes
very
prevalent
as
the
beer
warms
slight
sourness
that
is
very
refreshing
this
is
a
good
refresher
beer
sticky
in
the
mouth
good
bite
on
the
tongue
drinkable
and
better
if
it
isnt
icecold
a
good
summer
pilsener
pale
straw
color
with
a
bright
white
dense
head
leaving
lots
of
clingy
foam
the
nose
is
bright
and
fresh
with
only
a
hint
of
sulfur
and
something
vegetal
cabbagey
the
taste
starts
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
plenty
of
carbonation
decent
malt
and
an
interesting
aftertaste
apples
and
earl
grey
very
refreshing
ultra
drinkable
the
flavors
are
quick
but
true
it
doesnt
get
sickly
sweet
as
it
warms
remains
quaffable
all
the
way
classic
pilsner
from
saxony
lighter
than
most
its
german
counterparts
but
tastier
malty
sweetness
gives
way
to
hoppy
bitterness
in
the
finish
nice
complex
aroma
too
pleasant
aftertaste
impeccable
appearance
good
honest
beer
much
loved
in
germany
notes
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
example
of
a
german
pilsner
and
one
ill
go
back
to
when
i
see
it
fresh
a
very
pale
yellow
with
nice
head
retention
not
overly
carbonated
unfortunately
it
has
a
detergent
smell
to
it
and
is
far
too
sweet
in
the
aftertast
it
says
its
just
water
malt
hops
and
yeast
but
it
actually
tastes
corn
syrup
to
me
not
the
worst
beer
ever
but
i
will
pass
it
by
the
next
time
overall
drinkable
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
that
makes
you
want
to
drink
it
mouth
nicely
balanced
flavor
touching
all
parts
of
the
tongue
it
enters
with
a
sweetish
flavor
of
grainsbread
as
it
moves
back
there
are
notes
of
kitchen
spices
predominantly
of
coriander
all
the
way
in
the
back
the
bitter
metallic
hop
flavors
dominate
the
mouth
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
but
the
overcarbonation
piques
the
nerves
a
bit
too
much
i
recommend
a
violent
pour
to
loosen
the
beer
up
a
bit
had
a
slightly
cloudy
golden
appearance
with
a
little
white
head
nothing
stood
out
in
the
smell
department
had
a
slightly
sweet
wheaty
taste
little
bubbly
but
generally
a
smooth
pour
down
the
back
of
the
throat
great
beer
to
drink
on
a
sunny
afternoon
or
a
hot
afternoon
or
a
cold
night
or
a
windy
day
or
a
you

the

with
a
large

foam
very
good
retention
with
thick
chunky
lacing
the
smell
is
quite
light
with
light
floral
hops
and
some
graininess
the
flavor
is
a
nice
balance
of
sweet
bready
malt
which
blends
into
a
lightly
floral
hop
finish
there
was
a
bit
of
a
metallic
twinge
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
across
the
palate
that
leaves
a
dry
crisp
finish
a
good
pilsner
its
not
really
unique
or
overly
flavorful
but
fits
the
style
well
a
decent
german
pilsner
that
id
be
interested
in
trying
in
a
bottle
to
see
if
that
metallic
quality
is
still
present
im
not
a
big
fan
of
floral
hops
either
and
that
combined
with
the
metallic
twang
lowers
the
taste
quite
a
bit
looks
fantastic
could
be
a
bit
more
golden
but
the
mouthfeel
drinkability
and
weak
aroma
dont
stand
out
in
any
way
worth
a
try
pours
a
very
light
yellow
with
a
large
billowing
white
head
that
is
slow
to
dissipate
and
leaves
some
lacing
as
it
recedes
a
floral
hoppiness
overlays
the
nose
with
spices
yeast
and
some
malts
as
well
taste
is
sweet
with
some
fruits
and
malts
in
the
mix
and
a
hoppy
tone
throughout
which
becomes
more
noticable
in
the
finish
mouthfeel
is
crisp
light
and
well
carbonated
drinkability
is
solid
a
very
acceptable
example
of
the
style
better
than
average
id
say
its
a
milder
pilsner
thats
easy
to
take
excellent
session
beer
good
beer
to
keep
in
the
cooler
at
a
barbecue
comments
very
disappointing
a
pilsner
can
be
so
much
more
than
this
i
would
recommend
this
not
to
light
and
not
to
strong
a
good
example
for
a
german
pilsner
ive
also
had
it
in
a
bottle
with
the
same
experience
except
that
one
had
a
slight
bottleiron
taste
well
kind
of
disappointing
where
are
the
hops
these
guys
should
know
better
shouldnt
they
this
is
a
beer
that
deserves
way
more
credit
and
as
a
whole
pilsners
seem
to
be
overlooked
but
they
are
really
becoming
one
of
my
favorite
styles
more
and
more
these
days
but
back
to
this
particular
pils
its
very
well
made
and
true
to
style
with
out
being
too
textbook
appears
a
perfect
pale
color
straw
like
with
excellent
clarity
a
decent
dense
head
lasts
for
a
while
once
again
this
style
seems
to
be
overlooked
and
if
youre
looking
for
a
beer
thats
going
to
smack
you
in
the
face
with
flavor
go
to
the
west
coast
and
drink
some
ipas
this
beer
has
a
lot
of
subtleties
to
it
that
all
seem
to
work
together
a
sturdy
base
of
pale
malts
and
light
honey
tastes
combine
with
a
really
spicy
and
herbal
hop
profile
nice
black
pepper
hints
and
general
zestyness
a
bit
of
lemony
zang
in
there
as
well
one
of
the
smoothest
beers
ive
ever
drank
and
perfect
for
when
you
want
to
drink
more
than
a
few
in
an
evening
definately
do
yourself
a
favor
and
check
out
some
pilsners
itll
make
you
rethink
a
few
things
about
beer
in
general
well
i
guess
im
just
speaking
for
myself
when
i
say
that
but
regardless
this
beer
is
great
a
solid
german
pilsner
poured
out
to
a
clear
mellowed
blonde
color
with
a
respectable
12
inch
head
some
minor
lacing
around
the
glass
odors
of
grass
grain
and
dough
are
prominent
taste
is
mild
and
enjoyable
flavors
of
hops
malt
and
grain
all
the
while
remaining
light
and
fresh
lighter
mouthfeel
leads
me
to
believe
that
this
could
be
a
good
session
beer
probably
even
better
on
tap
worth
a
try
radeberger
pilsner
is
a
generic
pilsener
to
be
fair
though
its
a
decent
drinkable
generic
pilsener
having
said
that
i
doubt
that
ill
remember
it
past
the
point
when
i
click
the
review
button
id
drink
it
again
and
again
slight
spicy
peppery
hop
bite
followed
by
a
smooth
malty
finish
very
smooth
mouthfeel
the
carbonation
is
tickly
and
pleasant
it
does
have
some
stickiness
but
it
is
in
a
velvety
way
extremely
quaffable
golden
pilsener
wont
blow
you
away
but
allinall
pleasant
and
easy
to
drink
canned
poured
out
a
clear
pale
straw
pilsner
with
an
impressive
fluffy
white
cap
that
laces
the
glass
well
very
light
nose
gentle
grassy
aromas
with
diminutive
wisps
of
sweet
grains
starts
malty
and
citrusy
then
the
hop
bittering
takes
over
the
malt
spine
which
is
too
thin
imho
and
it
ends
in
a
dry
bitter
finish
i
can
take
or
leave
this
one
with
more
substantially
malted
distinctive
german
beers
like
konig
wernesgruner
and
gosser
on
the
lcbo
shleves
for
the
same
coin
why
would
they
offer
this
marginally
premiun
beer
a
very
decent
german
pilsner
quite
the
pleasant
change
of
pace
after
sampling
some
high
quality
stouts
belgians
and
old
ales
this
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow

that
is
clear
as
a
pristine
mountain
stream
fluffy
white

quickly
diminishes
into

spicy
german
hops
with
a
grassy

component
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and

taste
is
just
right
for
a
well
constructed
german
pilsener
grainy
and
bready
malt
is
happily
married
to
the
grassy
and
herbal
hops
aftertaste
is
dry
and
mildly
bitter
and
astringent
very
clean
and
crisp
i
would
love
to
have
a
case
of
this
one
in
the
fridge
ideal
lawnmower
beer
with
elegant
german
class
i
try
and
stay
away
from
cans
but
there
are
certain
exceptions
most
of
them
germans
a
classy
black
and
gold
can
definitely
not
your
run
of
the
mill
type
this
lager
is
a
very
pale

the

gives
it

but
it
simply
did
not
seem
to
move
bright
white
ice
cream
velvety
look
to
it
it
actually
looks
much
like
milk
from
the
top
that
is
how
tight
and
creamy
it
is
some
large
bubble
lacing
better
than
many
bottled
lagers
the
aroma
is
typical
of
a
german
pilsener
but
it
is
appetising
and
has
all
the
smells
i
was
expecting
subdued
fruitiness
pale
malt
hop
grassiness
the
aroma
is
well
balanced
between
the
three
fresh
adjunct
free
aroma
typical
taste
too
but
well
brewed
all
the
regular
suspects
here
grainy
malt
in
the
front
and
middle
and
a
very
respectable
dryness
grassy
and
even
oily
i
taste
some
good
caramel
wheat
cereal
and
hard
water
the
hops
leave
some
earthy
notes
and
metallic
ironlike
ones
a
balanced
taste
with
the
hops
slightly
more
dominant
in
the
finish
toned
down
carbonation
compared
to
many
canned
pilseners
which
is
a
nice
change
mouthfeel
is
dry
but
not
overly
and
medium
bodied
just
full
and
just
watery
enough
to
make
it
highly
drinkable
radeberger
is
a
typical
unexciting
but
well
done
lager
in
the
german
tradition
this
is
worth
a
try
on
a
summer
day
what
a
remarkable
pils
nothing
tastes
better
than
a
hard
day
a
work
and
coming
home
to
a
golden
crisp
taste
of
radeberger
i
believe
it
comes
from
this
region
of
germany
where
the
pils
taste
like
heaven
the
best
beer
from
saxony
and
the
best
german
pils
hands
down
not
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
but
not
bad
i
wouldnt
kick
it
out
of
the
fridge
for
eating
crackers
ok
pils
with
tons
of
creamy
foam
can
metallic
influence
but
the
only
choice
at
lcbo
light
mouthfeel
points
as
not
sticky
dry
finish
rather
nice
bit
of
clean
and
somewhat
sweet
aftertaste
herbal
character
and
would
go
with
smoked
foods
in
meal
a
beer
to
be
had
on
the
colder
side
pours
a
light
gold
color
the
head
is
frothy
and
big
with
average
retention
and
a
patchwork
of
lace
left
behind
the
aroma
is
of
barley
some
grassy
saaz
hops
and
a
sulfury
note
the
taste
is
a
great
mix
of
robust
bready
malts
and
sea
air
saaz
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
but
very
smooth
and
pleasant
an
above
average
pilsner
very
tasty
and
full
drinkability
is
not
bad
a
fairly
good
pilsener
that
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
again
but
nothing
to
get
excited
about
came
in
a
black
500
ml
can
pours
out
a
clear
crisp
straw
colour
capped
by
a
large
billowy
head
of
white
foam
excellent
retention
with
thick
chunky
lacing
the
nose
is
faint
with
metallic
grains
and
light
floral
hops
the
flavour
is
a
decent
balance
of
sweet
bready
malt
moving
towards
metallic
grains
in
the
middle
which
blends
seemlessly
into
the
floral
slightly
herbal
hop
finish
and
carries
through
the
aftertaste
excellent
quenching
mouthfeel
across
the
palate
that
turns
on
a
dime
into
a
dry
crisp
finish
the
hops
are
contained
and
do
not
turn
astringent
a
very
impressive
pilsener
its
not
overwhelmingly
unique
or
flavourful
but
has
everything
in
the
right
place
and
stands
on
its
own
as
a
good
standard
for
the
style
recommended
crisp
autumn
leaf
colour
that
reminds
me
of
fishing
at
sunset
big
fluffy
head
pours
straight
outta
the
can
but
slowly
subsides
to
about
one
lasting
finger
lace
sticks
to
the
glass
at
random
intervals
hard
to
describe
but
basically
a
chaotic
pattern
of
lacy
foam
bakery
bread
smell
with
not
much
hops
the
nose
is
almost
fooled
into
thinking
this
is
a
solid
food
not
a
liquid
the
bread
smell
is
so
convincing
taste
is
more
balanced
than
the
scent
their
is
that
malty
flavour
upfront
its
like
drinking
fresh
white
bread
tasty
and
settles
great
in
the
stomach
yet
the
aftertaste
has
a
bittering
dryness
a
quick
slap
letting
you
know
hops
are
used
in
this
pilzner
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thick
pretty
drinkable
as
a
session
beer
and
something
most
people
would
at
least
like
this
beer
pours
a
standard
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
fades
away
skunky
aroma
not
even
slightly
interesting
maybe
it
was
a
bad
bottle
maybe
it
was
a
standard
pilsner
from
that
area
the
taste
was
not
interesting
to
me
crisp
and
slightly
clean
but
still
skunky
in
the
taste
didnt
care
for
this
one
pours
a
pale
straw
colour
and
has
a
nice
floral
smell
the
taste
is
decent
but
it
does
not
have
as
crisp
a
finish
as
i
like
in
my
pils
the
finish
fades
away
but
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
great
for
sessions
but
a
little
pricey
compared
with
other
pilseners
that
i
prefer
bc
has
a
lot
of
euro
lagers
in
500ml
cans
which
is
good
because
they
can
be
purchased
individually
and
are
never
light
struck
radeberger
is
the
newest
available
german
lager
and
it
is
pretty
decent
all
round
the
colour
is
pale
gold
with
a
hoppy
nose
the
profile
is
fresh
and
full
bodied
with
a
hoppy
finish
this
is
much
better
than
any
bc
lager
due
its
balance
and
big
flavour
at
2
10
a
can
this
is
a
great
deal
and
well
worth
buying
this
is
just
another
run
of
the
mill
german
lager
boring
boring
boring
the
beer
pours
typical
lager
except
it
has
quite
a
large
dense
head
smells
faintly
of
earthy
hops
flavour
comes
through
the
same
crisp
clean
with
a
strong
earthy
hop
character
not
bad
but
not
something
i
will
return
to
this
is
a
disappointing
beer
i
was
expecting
something
similar
to
a
czech
pilsner
german
style
this
was
a
very
distant
inbred
cousin
thumbs
down
pours
a
clear
greenish
gold
under
a
one
finger
white
head
that
fades
quickly
but
musters
a
few
spots
of
lace
the
nose
is
sweet
malt
the
mouth
is
light
and
prickly
there
is
a
decent
malt
base
taste
overlayed
with
a
light
hoppy
bite
the
hops
are
neither
flowery
nor
metallic
just
crisp
and
clean
this
bite
lingers
a
bit
into
the
aftertaste
but
is
mild
and
shortlived
radeberger
is
better
now
than
when
it
was
the
flagship
brew
of
the
gdr
but
it
still
aint
no
great
shakes
this
pours
with
a
clean
yellow
body
there
is
a
nice
foamy
head
that
leaves
a
little
lace
there
is
a
distinct
fruity
aroma
grapes
a
wine
like
aroma
the
flavor
starts
out
with
a
light
sweet
graininess
and
finishes
with
a
smooth
bitterness
at
the
back
off
your
tongue
a
mildly
refreshing
easy
drinking
pilsner
a
very
drinkable
beer
pretty
much
sums
up
all
the
things
that
are
good
about
a
pilsner
overall
a
great
drink
i
am
not
a
pilsner
fan
but
i
did
like
this
one
radeberger
pils
is
firmbodied
and
flowery
a
nice
crisp
clean
beer
with
no
hint
of
diacetyl
as
a
proper
german
pils
should
be
it
has
a
nice
balancing
bitterness
to
it
which
leaves
a
lingering
tingle
on
my
tongue
requiring
another
imbibation
if
my
taste
buds
were
not
so
adulterated
by
homebrewing
with
excessive
hop
levels
i
might
even
say
it
was
bit
bitter
radeberger
is
a
fairly
dry
beer
which
helps
to
accentuate
the
hop
bitterness
ng
the
beer
pours
with
a
very
clear
straw
color
and
a
frothy
white
head
like
you
expect
from
a
pilsener
the
beer
itself
has
a
nice
earthy
and
grassy
smell
with
some
nice
malt
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
light
but
not
watery
tastewise
this
is
a
very
good
pilsener
with
nice
malt
flavors
and
a
bit
of
hops
for
kick
enjoyable
and
drinkable
a
nice
break
away
from
the
other
light
colored
beers
since
not
a
lot
of
people
know
about
here
at
the
local
beverage
store
the
price
is
a
measly
4
bucks
an
even
better
deal
for
a
great
pils
cheers
i
still
prefer
the
czech
versions
better
czechvar
and
rebel
especially
but
i
might
revisit
this
one
again
this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
strawlike
yellow
color
with
a
very
large
white
rocky
head
the
smell
is
breadlike
malt
spicey
and
earthy
the
taste
is
mild
pleasant
breadlike
malt
with
ascending
spicey
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
moderate
with
a
rounded
quality
to
it
overall
a
very
pleasing
smooth
bodied
beer
with
a
nice
bitterness
bright
light
golden
color
with
a
nice
pillowy
head
nose
is
somewhat
malty
with
light
grassy
hops
fresh
hoppy
aroma
body
is
spritzy
with
crispy
leafy
hops
and
a
touch
of
malt
not
a
bad
pils
although
it
could
stand
for
a
little
more
malt
flavor
good
clean
and
crisp
flavors
with
a
nice
hoppy
bite
in
the
finish
better
than
i
expected
544
pat
this
crisp
pilsner
is
shiny
straw
in
color
though
light
in
malt
body
it
maintains
a
refreshing
herbal
malt
flavor
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
sweet
with
hops
being
the
dominant
smell
the
sharp
metallic
and
citrus
hops
blend
in
nicely
with
the
malt
which
reveals
itself
further
throughout
the
glass
a
hint
of
herbs
and
lemon
can
be
detected
nice
white
head
lasts
awhile
and
leaves
behind
a
nice
lace
bright
and
clean
finish
good
beer
worthy
of
atleast
2
a
night
a
very
impressive
brew
colour
is
a
very
light
golden
hue
almost
clear
this
pilsner
starts
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
then
switches
to
a
minor
malty
sweetness
that
sticks
around
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
crown
after
taste
is
very
pleasant
a
little
to
sweet
but
not
by
much
this
3
pack
came
with
a
mini
mug
bonus
radeberger
a
pilsner
from
germany
a
yellow
beer
with
a
pure
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
little
unusual
for
the
style
as
it
seems
to
have
a
prominent
aroma
of
caramel
malts
with
a
hint
of
skunk
it
seems
as
if
the
hops
are
initially
present
and
then
the
beer
rounds
out
with
very
nice
and
favorable
malts
very
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
with
a
clean
aftertaste
that
leaves
a
hint
of
the
malts
to
top
it
off
it
was
on
sale
and
the
nice
sample
lady
gave
me
a
free
pilsner
glass
to
enjoy
it
with
notes
an
easy
to
drink
traditional
german
pils
clean
and
quick
a
very
refreshing
light
session
beer
surely
a
step
or
two
above
st
pauli
girl
and
becks
could
make
for
a
most
excellent
fall
back
beer
to
have
in
the
fridge
year
round
easy
drinking
with
some
character
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
is
bold
and
a
nice
very
american
take
on
the
traditional
old
world
style
overall
not
a
bad
pilsner
taste
lovely
smoothness
fluffy
moderate
body
fresh
maltiness
bread
grassy
nutty
spicy
herbal
hop
balanced
bitterness
oily
resin
clean
palate
peppery
long
dry
hoppy
finish
a
good
basic
pils
i
think
it
would
work
great
in
a
can
on
a
hot
day
very
cloudy
kind
of
tart
smells
funky
almost
saisonlike
its
highly
carbed
bitter
with
a
twang
honestly
this
seems
infected
i
have
another
so
ill
see
how
that
one
tastes
but
its
likely
from
the
same
batch
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
has
a
decent
drinkable
feel
there
is
done
nice
crispness
here
that
still
adds
to
the
overall
experience
of
this
beer
this
beer
ended
up
being
older
than
i
realized
but
there
still
is
something
here
to
enjoy
great
pilsner
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
head
the
smell
was
mild
yet
had
a
couple
layers
from
the
hops
and
the
malt
the
flavor
was
full
of
grains
and
then
citrus
and
earthy
notes
from
the
hops
i
found
this
beer
very
refreshing
and
not
too
heavy
a
wonderful
beer
you
can
enjoy
a
couple
without
becoming
overwhelmed
or
bored
o
this
is
a
nice
beer
a
little
less
hoppy
then
a
sam
adams
noble
pils
its
not
overdone
at
all
just
a
lager
with
some
bite
i
think
it
was
put
together
well
i
would
drink
another
overall
quite
nice
a
really
well
done
lager
with
a
nice
grassy
hop
noble
hop
character
that
turns
almost
american
like
on
the
finish
spicy
too
with
nice
pilsner
malts
and
lagering
qualities
quite
nice
and
happy
with
this
brewery
now
cant
wait
to
try
the
others
cheers
perfectly
acceptable
on
a
hot
day
like
today
that
said
ol
factory
doesnt
stand
out
that
much
to
me
against
what
else
is
out
there
for
local
pilsners
a
bit
above
average
a
light
pilsner
clean
crisp
and
more
flavorful
than
lite
good
beer
but
i
prefer
something
were
more
heft
overall
a
nice
twist
on
the
style
all
traditional
characteristics
are
there
and
enjoyable
light
yellow
slight
haze
bright
white
collar
with
some
stickage
fruity
citrusy
nose
mild
malt
character
moderate
bitterness
stronger
in
the
finish
a
bit
citrusy
and
herbal
solid
malt
base
mediumlight
bodied
moderate
carbonation
decent
texture
pretty
good
mix
of
characters
dry
hopping
was
a
good
call
overall
a
very
good
refreshing
pilsner
that
would
make
for
an
excellent
session
beer
more
hops
in
the
nose
and
flavor
than
most
other
pilsner
beers
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
overall
superb
pilsener
not
a
big
beer
not
a
wacky
beer
but
a
great
beer
those
dudes
down
by
the
sikorksy
plant
are
on
to
something
i
need
to
seek
out
more
of
their
product
tmo
taste
is
classic
pils
with
a
nice
medium
bodied
feel
easy
drinker
and
a
great
one
for
the
warmer
weather
pils
is
not
my
fav
style
but
i
enjoyed
this
one
crrisp
as
well
as
refreshing
everything
youd
want
from
your
pilsner
a
little
more
overall
a
tasty
subtle
pilsner
o
i
found
this
to
be
an
enjoyable
american
version
of
a
germanstyled
beer
it
tasted
a
little
hoppier
compared
to
other
beers
in
the
german
pilsener
style
and
the
hop
aromas
and
flavors
seemed
more
resembling
that
of
a
munich
helles
lager
overall
stands
out
as
a
very
good
beer
in
a
category
in
which
very
good
is
uncommon
if
you
are
a
picky
beer
drinker
but
you
need
a
break
from
ipas
and
stouts
and
its
warm
outside
buy
this
beer
overall
this
a
solid
pilsner
nothing
else
to
say
overall
a
pretty
interesting
take
on
the
style
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
a
totally
different
hop
profile
from
what
was
expected
cheers
o
nicely
surprised
with
this
new
one
out
of
ct
great
depth
of
hop
aroma
pours
very
clear
bright
gold
thick
half
inch
of
white
foam
nose
is
light
pilsy
bitter
german
style
clean
open
firm
hop
that
balances
out
nice
blend
with
a
notch
higher
bitter
than
a
typical
pils
crisp
finish
some
citrus
very
good
absolutely
one
of
the
best
pils
ive
had
clear
pale
gold
in
the
glass
with
a
big
frothy
white
head
that
is
lacing
a
lot
the
smell
is
a
bit
faint
but
of
pale
malts
and
spicy
hops
this
beer
is
described
as
a
dry
hopped
pilsner
and
that
seems
evident
by
the
fresh
hop
bite
in
the
taste
which
is
actually
much
more
noticeable
than
i
was
expecting
noble
hops
provide
much
of
the
base
which
is
appropriate
for
the
style
bitterness
and
hop
flavor
is
a
bit
higher
than
normal
but
in
a
good
way
the
base
of
this
beer
is
a
pale
malt
providing
a
fresh
bread
taste
and
mouthfeel
the
yeasts
provide
a
typical
lager
profile
mostly
clean
but
with
a
touch
of
spice
this
beer
is
quite
lively
as
the
result
of
a
good
dose
of
carbonation
and
the
tingly
hop
bitterness
the
finish
is
pretty
clean
with
just
a
hint
of
the
pale
malt
and
slightly
bigger
hit
of
hoppy
spice
and
bitterness
hanging
around
overall
im
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
a
good
example
of
an
often
overlooked
style
perhaps
updated
a
bit
with
the
extra
dose
of
hops
this
brewery
happens
to
just
a
short
drive
from
where
i
live
so
im
excited
that
it
looks
like
ill
have
a
good
local
brewer
to
support
something
that
there
are
too
few
of
in
ct
odtasty
but
could
have
been
better
not
my
favorite
from
this
new
brewery
but
its
actually
a
pretty
legit
us
pils
probably
wont
get
a
six
pack
for
myself
again
however
i
would
buy
this
for
a
friend
or
take
it
to
a
gathering
as
it
is
very
agreeable
yet
still
has
enough
zing
12oz
bottle
pours
a
translucent
light
straw
color
with
a
half
inch
of
head
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
spicy
hops
grass
and
sweet
bread
the
taste
is
more
of
the
same
bready
at
first
followed
by
some
spicy
hops
some
floral
notes
along
with
some
sourdough
bread
slightly
bitter
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
flavor
to
it
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
a
little
hoppier
than
most
beers
of
this
style
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
to
grab
once
in
awhile
peppery
resinous
hop
bitterness
up
front
spicy
noble
hop
flavors
preside
over
soft
bready
cookieish
malt
light
sweetness
but
the
dry
spicy
hop
bitterness
dominates
thankfully
moderate
body
with
a
lively
refreshing
feel
a
very
nice
addition
to
the
ct
beer
scene
will
be
buying
more
of
this
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
cheers
taste
this
beer
really
opens
up
and
changes
throughout
the
course
of
a
sitting
it
is
very
precise
flavors
quiet
dry
some
serious
mineral
and
salty
qualities
about
it
good
balanced
malt
but
not
heavy
by
any
means
a
wonderful
stank
to
it
as
i
mentioned
upon
first
appearance
this
beer
seemed
to
be
a
hopped
up
american
lager
im
glad
i
bought
a
sixer
though
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
after
tasting
the
beer
and
would
say
its
one
of
the
better
american
pilsners
out
there
ive
only
seen
this
brewerys
beers
in
one
place
but
will
definitely
be
on
the
lookout
for
any
other
offerings
and
this
one
again
this
was
very
euro
in
approach
but
very
american
style
in
taste
i
think
more
people
should
not
be
afraid
to
gravitate
to
the
pils
great
offering
from
two
roads
o
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
solid
beer
to
session
with
for
a
long
time
overall
an
above
average
hoppy
but
not
overly
hoppy
german
pils
if
i
am
in
the
mood
for
the
style
i
would
certainly
get
this
the
dry
hopping
adds
a
refreshing
element
that
said
there
are
others
in
the
style
i
would
get
first
entry
is
full
yet
somewhat
crisp
on
the
palate
lots
of
grain
flavors
followed
by
a
mild
hop
kick
tastes
a
little
heavy
for
a
pils
but
still
very
enjoyable
my
wife
enjoyed
a
full
pint
and
she
is
averse
to
micros
so
that
is
saying
something
i
would
definitely
have
another
pint
next
time
i
see
it
on
tap
poured
from
a
500ml
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
bright
golden
color
and
dense
long
lasting
white
head
great
floral
aromas
taste
is
delicate
and
refreshing
with
the
same
floral
notes
and
just
enough
tangy
hops
good
carbonation
medium
mouthfeel
this
is
everything
a
great
german
pilsner
should
be

i
liked
this
pils
a
lot
a
good
brewery
that
i
havent
had
nearly
enough
beers
from
frothy
in
the
glass
i
mean
a
big
tall
white
head
with
great
retention
and
a
lot
of
bubbles
but
its
not
all
that
lighter
a
darker
shade
of
golden
goldenrod
more
less
yellow
more
dense
richer
the
nose
and
taste
both
produce
fresh
cereals
grassy
hops
very
german
all
the
way
but
less
dusty
on
the
grain
a
touch
more
weighted
crystal
malt
and
a
yeast
strain
thats
both
clean
and
extremely
flavorful
which
is
uncommon
in
the
style
to
say
the
least
about
it
its
bready
and
sturdy
and
unlike
most
others
which
i
think
makes
this
beer
special
a
little
filling
for
a
pils
with
all
the
body
and
maybe
dominant
for
more
delicate
foods
but
its
a
darn
good
beer
interesting
its
organic
and
i
think
something
a
little
more
robust
on
the
pils
spectrum
nice

to

slight

nice

flavor
overall
perhaps
i
bought
an
old
bottle
but
this
just
tasted

papery

the

offsets
the

slightly

did

this

is
refreshing
and
a
good
drinking
beer
a
simple
german
pilsner
that
is
brewed
to
style
i
enjoy
the
sharp
bite
at
the
end
and
the
dry
finish
it
is
also
an
overall
good
looking
beer
would
buy
again
o
a
pretty
lackluster
pilsner
another
rather
disappointing
example
from
a
brewery
that
was
once
a
soughtafter
import
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
but
i
would
say
to
try
this
one
anyway
its
organic
and
it
could
simply
be
that
this
bottle
was
not
fresh
overall
a
solid
but
unremarkable
pils
well
crafted
but
just
too
tame
to
the
point
a
very
tasty
german
pilsener
enjoyable
o
easy
to
drink
and
enjoyable
but
not
as
clean
as
a
lot
of
other
beers
in
this
style
german
pilsener
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
be
unfiltered
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
german
pilsner
its
not
as
hoppy
and
doesnt
have
as
much
bite
as
other
versions
of
the
style
but
its
still
worth
a
try
it
is
a
steal
for
the
price
1
49
for
about
a
pint
size
bottle
o
i
know
im
young
to
german
pilsners
but
this
one
might
take
the
cake
great
layers
of
malt
and
hops
make
this
borish
looking
beer
extremely
complex
carbonation
is
spot
on
also
making
this
beer
perfect
for
summertime
evening
and
late

o
an
insatiably
drinkable
pilsner
that
has
the
classic
hallmarks
with
some
added
yeasty
and
fruity
flavours
to
make
it
truly
complex
full
bodied
for
the
style
with
a
crisp
earthy
hop
bite
that
lingers
over
the
pale
malt
bready

and
light
fruit
notes
into

malts
slightly
metallic
in
the
finish
but
this
beer
us
refreshing
decently
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
excellent
pilsner
o
this
beer
tastes
a
little
more
rugged
and
less
clean
compared
to
other
pilsnerspossibly
due
to
its
organic
naturebut
it
is
still
relatively
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
to
the
point
where
im
not
sure
what
else
i
could
really
ask
for
from
a
tastemouthfeel
standpoint
wish
it
came
in
a
little
more
of
a
convenient
form
but
i
will
take
what
i
can
get
a
great
example
of
a
relatively
small
beer
packing
in
a
great
flavor
profile
without
being
overwhelming
this
is
truly
what
a
pilsener
should
be
the
color
was
a
beautiful
deep
yellow
with
a
snow
white
head
of
small
bubbles
the
aroma
was
full
of
light
malt
and
a
subtle
noble
hop
nose
the
head
did
fade
as
it
was
drunk
the
taste
was
spot
on
with
a
malt
front
and
a
smooth
hop
finish
an
excellent
offering
exactly
what
this
should
be
o
absolutely
great
a
must
try
and
something
i
will
look
for
again
o
i
like
a
good
pilsener
every
now
and
then
and
this
is
easily
a
good
pilsener
therefore
this
is
pretty
damn
enjoyable
only
thing
is
i
like
my
pilseners
to
be
more
well
hopped
but
now
im
just
nitpicking
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
exactly
what
i
would
want
from
the
style
full
flavor
which
consisted
of
a
nice
complex
grain
taste
but
is
very
well
balanced
with
only
a
very
slight
hop
presence
the
beer
is
light
clean
crisp
and
leaves
a
slightly
dry
aftertaste
frankly
after
i
was
done
with
that
bottle
i
was
wishing
that
i
had
another
the
abv
was
not
noticeable
at
all
and
this
is
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
day
i
will
be
heading
back
to
the
store
for
this
one
overall
an
outstanding
brew
that
is
indeed
world
class
pours
a
slightly
hazy
gold
with
a
2
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
patterns
of
lace
form
around
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
grass
hay
and
some
slight
lemon
zest
taste
is
of
grain
grass
and
citrus
zest
there
is
a
slight
bitterness
and
lemon
sourness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
low
level
of
carbonation
with
a
somewhat
flat
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsener
but
the
mouthfeel
is
very
lacking
in
my
opinion
o
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
i
am
not
a
super
big
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
one
i
would
have
no
problem
in
ordering
again
even
if
it
wasnt
organic
pours
a
deep
straw
color
with
a
huge
white
head
that
surprisingly
dissipates
almost
instantly

of
bready
malt
with
lots
of
melanoids
slightly
earthy
spicy
hop
bite
taste
is
bready
burnt
malt
with
a
hint
of
earthy
spicy
hops
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
crisp
level
of
carbonation
and
a
sweet
slick
mouthfeel
decent
brew
but
a
little
boring
even
for
the
style
light
and
refreshing
i
could
see
drinking
some
on
a
hot
summer
day
overall
not
a
bad
brew
and
it
does
have
a
nice
nostalgic
quality
for
me
but
in
general
not
terribly
intriguing
o
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
its
the
first
organic
beer
ive
had
and
am
definitely
not
disappointed
ive
got
a
huge
soft
spot
for
german
beers
and
where
as
pilsners
arent
exactly
my
favorite
style
i
feel
that
this
one
shines
above
and
beyond
most
beer
is
a
slightly
hazy
pale
kentucky
straw
color
with
very
active
bubbles
nice
foamy
white
head
and
traces
of
lacing
down
the
little
glass
aroma
is
really
great
light
notes
of
baked
bread
and
yeast
flavor
is
light
with
notes
of
green
apple
and
grape
very
slight
tartsour
finish
is
really
pleasant
good
effervescence
keeps
the
finish
nice
and
short
overall
a
nice
example
of
the
style
with
its
own
unique
twists
poured
a
2
white
head
which
quickly
dissipated
hazy
light
straw
yellow
color
smells
grassy
but
not
much
else
taste
is
pretty
much
straight
bmc
pils
with
only
a
very
brief
finish
and
not
much
of
hops
other
than
being
organic
i
just
dont
find
much
remarkable
about
this
sample
maybe
mine
was
older
than
its
prime
i
dont
know
because
most
reviewers
seem
to
have
a
better
impression
of
this
beer
o
pilsners
arent
my
very
favorite
admittedly
but
ur
pils
by
pinkus
organic
is
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
had
super
refreshing
highly
drinkable
great
session
beer
could
easily
put
down
4
of
these
in
a
night
and
not
get
tired
of
it
very
tasty
but
in
a
brilliantly
subtle
way
recommended
beer
is
medium
to
light
in
body
and
i
love
this
brewery
the
finish
is
wet
and
it
is
quenching
throughout
it
is
a
good
beer
but
there
is
an
odd
flavor
on
the
finish
that
i
dont
think
is
suppose
to
be
there
there
is
an
almost
cidery
finish
with
a
mild
fruitiness
that
i
would
expect
perhaps
in
the
midpalate
other
than
this
it
is
a
perfectly
fine
beer
and
id
have
it
again
ive
had
it
dozens
of
times
and
finally
bothered
to
review
it
overall
this
is
definitely
a
very
highly
drinkable
and
tasty
beer
it
is
perfectly
suited
to
go
with
the
warm
summer
weather
my
only
complaint
is
the
fact
that
it
is
a
little
pricey
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
deal
but
at
around
6
for
500ml
i
can
think
of
many
other
thirst
quenching
pils
that
i
would
rather
be
drinking
instead
taste
is
crisp
like
youd
expect
from
a
pilsner
with
some
sweet
lemon
going
on
fine
bubbles
on
tongue
like
sparkling
wine
delicious
and
clean
overall
a
great
helles
id
love
to
put
a
few
away
in
a
beergarden
very
drinkable
a
good
beer
a
touch
more
tartness
that
usual
for
the
style
possibly
from
being
unfiltered
making
it
that
much
more
refreshing
though
not
more
flavorful
im
just
going
to
assume
that
i
need
to
try
a
fresh
one
i
was
unimpressed
and
of
the
belief
that
i
got
a
bad
beer
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
appears
much
like
a
hefeweizen
deep
orang
golden
hue
with
some
yeast
sediment
settling
to
the
bottom
of
my
glass
aroma
has
a
biscuit
malt
sweetness
with
herbalgrassy
hops
weighing
in
a
really
nice
noble
hop
nose
flavor
again
nice
malt
presencesturdy
hop
backing
with
herbalgrassiness
that
just
works

a

drinkability
overall
is
a
nice
sessionable
organic
pils
the
best
version
of
any
organic
beer
ive
had
thus
far
d
this
beer
has
a
clean
and
smooth
flavor
without
a
big
sulfury
quality
and
some
nice
subtle
hints
to
it
it
still
has
some
pils
character
but
the
unfiltered
beer
adds
some
nice
depth
notes
it
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
for
this
style
it
is
really
well
done
my
wife
really
likes
this
style
and
particularly
this
particular
brew
shes
tasting
it
with
me
now
and
would
give
it
an
a
if
it
were
her
review
as
robust
a
pilsner
as
i
have
sampled
and
equal
to
the
task
of
washing
down
a
shwarma
with
onions
olives
pickled
turnips
and
pepperoncini
drinkability
very
easy
to
drink
but
this
is
a
pilsner
to
be
respected
more
to
it
than
some
of
the
macrobrews
enjoy
at
home
not
the
type
to
buy
at
a
gas
station
to
quench
your
thirst
d

otherwise

lasts
for

but
never

completely
nose
is
light
and
clean
with
a
hint
of
herbal
notes
on
the
palate
the
malt
sweetness
is
appreciated
right
off
the
bat
with
a
nice
herbalgrassy
flavor
that
comes
through
to
the
finish
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
another
certified
organic
beer
the
pour
resulted
in
a
finger
of
bonewhite
head
with
low
retention
color
was
a
slightly
cloudy
goldenyellow
due
to
its
being
unfiltered
as
noted
on
the
label
nose
was
tending
more
to
malty
with
a
light
hops
presence
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
light
dry
taste
on
the
tongue
as
well
as
a
light
graininess
perhaps
due
to
being
unflitered
there
were
hops
present
but
not
in
the
inyourface
way
that
the
czechstyle
pilsners
can
be
with
their
saaz
hops
i
am
really
coming
to
enjoy
lagers
more
and
more
and
i
now
recognize
that
german
pilsners
are
equally
worthy
of
my
attention
the
finish
even
evidenced
the
characteristic
lagerlike
honey
sweetness
more
amazing
drinkibility
incredible
beer
new
favorite
german
pilsner
d
im
pretty
sure
this
is
my
first
organic
pils
and
my
first
unfiltered
pils
so
ill
raise
a
bratwurst
to
that
this
is
just
another
log
on
the
fire
of
my
recent
burning
affinity
toward
german
beers
of
both
high
and
low
quality
pinkus
is
at
the
ultra
violet
end
of
that
spectrum
taste
bitter
which
comes
as
a
shock
after
the
smell
the
taste
of
the
beer
killed
it
for
me
the
beer
pours
a
light
slightly
hazy
gold
color
with
good
head
retention
and
lacing
the
nose
is
just
great
in
this
pilsener
showing
honey
bread
dough
black
pepper
light
tangerine
and
light
brown
sugar
flavors
replicate
the
nose
pretty
closely
but
i
was
struck
by
the
amount
of
flavor
this
5
2
beer
delivers
on
the
other
hand
theres
nothing
heavy
about
this
beer
and
i
love
the
crisp
bitter
finish
the
hoppy
bitterness
while
not
the
least
bit
over
powering
balances
the
modest
honey
bread
dough
sweetness
pretty
much
perfectly
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
fairly
long
finish
carbonation
is
pretty
good
and
seems
perfect
for
the
style
this
beer
is
not
the
least
bit
gassy
drinkability
is
pretty
much
perfect
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
gulping
this
beer
down
it
was
that
delicious
and
easy
drinking
just
a
loverly
beer
d
classic
country
pilsner
how
it
was
done
in
the
1800s
id
love
to
try
this
out
of
a
wooden
keg
this
is
olde
time
pils
i
guess
the
coming
summation
is
trite
by
now
but
not
really
into
pilsners
this
one
was
okay
i
probably
wouldnt
buy
it
again
drinkability
flavorful
and
simple
crisp
refreshing
great
session
beer
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
sitting
around
on
the
deck
with
friends
on
a
hot
summer
night
its
clear
crisp
and
refreshing
but
its
got
plenty
of
flavor
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
ill
add
to
my
list
of
beers
to
have
again
slainte
and
gesundheit
d
very
drinkable
nice
like
flavor
and
very
refreshing
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
an
organic
pilsner
overall
i
liked
this
beer
the
major
downside
was
the
smell
as
soon
as
i
popped
the
cap
there
was
a
skunky
smell
coming
from
the
bottle
the
smell
doesnt
really
translate
to
the
taste
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
bitter
but
its
a
decent
beer
a
pilsner
might
not
be
my
first
choice
for
a
beer
but
this
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
beer
drinkability
for
around
4
this
was
a
very
solid
purchase
tasty
balanced
and
quality
stuff
id
definitely
pick
up
another
one
in
the
future
d
very
drinkable
a
bit
pricey
at
2
99
for
a
21ounce
bottle
though
poured
from
a
500
ml
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
no
freshness
date
on
the
bottle
yellow
gold
color
with
about
2
inches
of
thick
foamy
head
strong
scents
of
lemonlike
citrus
i
can
taste
the
naturalness
of
the
brew
the
unfiltered
grain
flavor
strong
biscuit
like
whole
grains
pretty
mild
hops
great
pilsner
taste
and
easy
to
drink
a
pleasantly
drinkable
pilsener
made
true
to
spec
and
well
rounded
between
the
malt
and
hop
components
sturdy
like
german
ox
buffalo
yak
or
whatever
theyve
got
over
there
first
sip
smooth
lightly
hopped
not
much
bitterness
either
quite
drinkable
a
mellow
yeasty
character
to
the
flavor
while
this
isnt
the
best
pils
out
there
it
was
certainly
enjoyable
and
a
bit
of
a
twist
from
the
usual
pils
id
have
liked
a
little
more
bite
in
the
taste
and
aroma
but
this
is
still
a
beer
worth
trying
this
was
my
first
organic
beer
and
a
very
pleasant
surprise
a
refreshing
beer
and
definitely
worth
a
shot
pours
a
pretty
nice
hazy
golden
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
nice
little
fizzy
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose

some

this
brew
surprised
me
d
i
expected
a
little
more
flavor
but
an
overall
okay
beer
nice
easy
drinking
beer
enjoyed
it
d
pinkus
urpils
delivers
a
quality
example
of
the
pils
style
though
it
makes
a
few
deviations
from
the
norm
it
is
a
great
brew
and
worth
giving
a
try
if
it
is
available
overall
an
ok
beer
but
i
wont
be
revisiting
it
with
so
many
other
good
pilsner
options
on
shelves
these
days
d
very
drinkable
i
could
easily
drink
too
many
of
these
certified
organic
thats
good
i
guess
but
i
bought
this
500
ml
bottle
mostly
because
it
was
2
99
at
meijer
and
i
had
never
seen
it
before
its
got
a
nice
strawyellow
hazy
color
and
contains
a
fair
amount
of
unfiltered
floaties
moderate
finebubbled
white
head
all
kinds
of
wonderful
smells
come
from
this
glass
clove
spice
banana
sugar
wheat
grain
bubble
gum
malt
these
same
flavors
are
in
the
taste
also
tastes
just
as
it
smells
and
the
texture
reminds
me
of
how
the
inside
of
a
whopper
malt
ball
dissolves
on
your
tounge
if
that
makes
sense
slightly
heavy
but
easy
drinking
good
stuff
unlike
any
pilsener
ive
ever
had
smell
is
very
nice
lemon
bananas
vanilla
apple
yeast
and
a
little
spice
taste
was
not
quite
as
complex
but
still
very
good
getting
a
lot
of
bananas
in
the
flavor
as
well
some
wheat
a
noticeable
hint
of
lemon
even
a
little
vanilla
that
i
got
in
the
aroma
really
great
stuff
pretty
drinkable
beer
just
not
my
favorite
due
to
the
lack
of
filtration
i
get
a
lot
of
wheat
beer
qualities
from
this
i
e
mild
yeasty
umph
with
swallow
banana
pudding
esthers
and
spice
granted
noble
hop
spice
not
chamomille
gingerale
aftertaste
this
is
a
very
very
superb
more
robust
pils
similar
in
style
to
a
gouden
haven
but
much
better
d
unimpressive
barely
finishable
and
rather
unejoyable
would
never
buy
again
or
recommend
d
i
found
this
to
be
a
pretty
decent
but
not
great
pils
it
seemed
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
to
me
more
like
a
munich
helles
than
a
true
pils
the
low
abv
makes
for
a
nice
session
beer
overall
i
am
finding
out
i
enjoy
german
pils
the
most
because
of
the
lemoncitrus
zest
drinkability
very
easily
drinkable
would
get
a
few
huge
billowing
head
of
highly
agitated
foam
pops
and
slides
from
three
fingers
down
to
a
solid
covering
leaves
a
good
deal
of
sticky
lacing
behind
sourdough
pretzel
and
semibitter
hops
pave
the
road
through
the
nose
lemon
peel
tobacco
and
earthy
with
a
little
bit
of
apple
apricot
fruit
in
there
yeastiness
lasts
longer
than
any
floral
qualities
mediumbodied
the
carbonation
is
heavy
like
its
just
a
bunch
of
water
balloons
in
the
mouth
no
real
lift
or
energy
from
it
spicier
hops
here
but
still
devolves
into
bready
notes
of
rye
sourdough
and
at
times
pumpernickel
has
a
familiar
organic
beer
wateriness
to
it
openly
knit
and
not
gathering
the
parts
into
a
whole
over
simple
fluid
movement
forward
ends
somewhat
prematurely
a
clean
traditional
and
inoffensive
representation
notes
this
beer
had
an
ok
mouthfeel
but
nothing
special
im
surprised
that
this
beer
is
this
off
pinkus
ur
pils
is
lightmedium
in
body
with
fine
subdued
carbonation
and
is
quite
an
easy
drinker
still
isnt
bad
notes
i
might
not
have
gotten
the
most
authentic
taste
of
this
brew
as
i
remembered
to
disrupt
the
yeast
only
after
i
had
poured
nearly
the
whole
glass
id
like
to
rereview
this
beer
at
a
later
date
and
pour
the
whole
thing
after
setting
the
yeast
in
motion
the
biggest
shame
though
is
that
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
very
low
almost
unnoticeable
alcohol
with
powerdy
florals
its
a
good
drinker
for
sure
because
its
not
filtered
its
not
as
crisp
as
i
want
for
a
pilsener
but
as
an
unfiltered
pils
its
to
style
and
very
good
this
beer
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
sparse
lacing
the
aroma
is
bready
with
caramel
and
mild
spicy
noble
hops
the
taste
is
spicier
than
the
aroma
with
a
more
subtle
malt
bill
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
lively
carbonation
overall
i
really
love
a
good
pilsener
but
this
just
doesnt
fit
the
bill
it
is
drinkable
but
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
this
beer
poured
a
hazy
straw
yellow
with
thick
white
head
the
head
retention
was
impressive
and
lasted
until
the
last
sip
the
aroma
was
mild
some
spicy
noble
hop
aroma
but
not
as
much
as
i
expected
the
taste
was
perfect
to
style
some
sweet
malt
up
front
followed
by
some
spicy
saaz
bitterness
overall
it
was
crisp
and
slightly
lemony
and
incredibly
drinkable
one
of
the
best
imported
german
pilseners
ive
had
in
the
us
halfliter
german
bottle
with
some
code
on
the
label
it
is
a
beautiful
golden
color
but
chockfull
of
sediment
and
is
capped
with
an
inch
of
semidense
white
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
spicy
and
earthy
hops
in
the
nose
make
way
for
some
sweetness
later
on
lightly
malty
on
the
palate
with
some
sweet
tones
that
strike
a
wonderful
balance
with
the
floral
grassy
spicy
perfumy
almost
citric
hops
that
impart
a
medium
bitterness
the
beer
is
tingly
and
dry
fairly
light
but
moving
into
a
nice
creaminess
and
imparting
a
lightly
hoppy
and
malty
sweet
finish
very
flavorful
and
incredibly
drinkable
relatively
inexpensive
to
boot
certainly
one
of
the
better
organic
beers
i
have
sampled
d
tasty
goes
down
easy
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
not
a
bad
beer
but
there
are
definitely
several
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
d
id
say
this
is
moderately
drinkable
interesting
flavor
but
its
not
really
what
i
want
from
a
pilsener
like
many
others
i
wonder
if
my
bottle
was
a
bit
old
pours
a
nice
sparkling
golden
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
cap
smells
somewhat
grainy
and
slightly
sour
from
the
grain
as
well
there
are
also
some
floral
hop
aromas
there
is
even
more
of
that
sour
graininess
in
the
mouth
and
it
overwhelms
the
hop
crispness
a
good
bit
the
sour
dies
off
a
bit
on
the
finish
and
there
is
a
bit
of
breadiness
that
appears
not
great
but
drinkable
the
sour
graininess
cuts
into
the
real
pleasures
of
a
nice
german
pilsner
this
is
missing
the
nice
earthyherbal
bitter
hop
bite
and
the
nice
crispness
that
usually
sets
the
beer
apart
a
bit
of
a
dissappointment
d
highly
drinkable
this
isnt
a
complex
beer
but
its
tasty
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
thought
i
would
although
my
bottle
looks
pretty
new
i
think
i
may
have
gotten
an
old
one
i
will
rereview
this
beer
later
as
this
one
did
not
impress
me
much
easy
drinking
purchased
20oz
bottle
from
whole
foods
downtown
was
looking
for
pinkus
munster
alt
which
is
excellent
by
the
way
but
didnt
find
it
so
i
thought
i
try
this
pours
a
murky
hefeweizenlike
gold
in
fact
the
only
thing
that
visually
distinguishes
this
from
a
hefeweizen
is
the
lack
of
any
head
or
lacing
whatsoever
smell
is
unmistakably
pilsener
clean
with
some
citrus
and
floral
tones
from
the
noble
hops
complemented
malt
graininess
nothing
too
exciting
but
pleasant
nonetheless
taste
is
obviously
similar
although
this
is
a
rather
raw
example
of
the
style
there
is
some
roughness
in
the
finish
that
makes
this
beer
less
quaffable
then
it
should
be
mouthfeel
is
fine
with
the
correct
amount
of
carbonation
contributing
to
an
appropriate
crispness
however
the
unpolished
finish
deters
overall
drinkability
i
would
not
choose
this
over
other
accomplished
examples
of
the
style
such
as
trumer
spaten
or
paulaner
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
longlasting
white
head
slightly
hazy
as
an
unfiltered
beer
malt
dominantgrainy
aroma
with
subtle
floral
noble
hop
aroma
strong
pilsner
malt
flavor
up
front
with
a
nice
crisp
dry
finish
very
noticable
bitterness
that
nicely
balances
the
malt
and
lingers
into
the
finish
light
bodied
with
a
moderately
high
carbonation
level
i
am
not
usually
a
big
fan
of
pilsner
but
this
is
a
very
good
example
of
the
style
bottle
from
the
utah
state
store
pours
a
golden
hue
with
a
medium
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
malts
some
floral
hops
and
grass
too
the
flavor
is
pretty
good
smooth
and
rich
malts
mostly
also
some
dry
yeast
ciderlike
flavors
a
touch
of
hops
and
a
generally
smooth
and
watery
body
very
nice
and
quaffable
conclusion
i
was
expecting
great
things
from
this
merchant
du
vinimported
beer
in
the
end
it
was
just
ok
from
other
reviews
im
wondering
if
i
got
a
somewhat
outdated
sample
it
seemed
like
there
were
great
things
lurking
underneath
quite
rich
in
heftflavor
but
everything
was
just
a
bit
muted
plenty
enjoyable
couple
this
beer
with
whatever
meal
you
care
to
or
have
it
alone
hell
have
two
i
am
afraid
that
i
left
this
beer
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
too
long
it
just
isnt
as
crispy
as
i
would
have
expected
this
just
means
ill
have
to
try
it
again
prost
d
one
of
the
most
easily
drinkable
beers
ive
had
in
a
while
i
could
really
quaff
this
stuff
for
a
good
long
while
american
macros
eat
your
heart
out
the
taste
is
at
first
fruity
with
apples
hints
of
pear
and
dry
tart
peach

the

blend
after
the

the

light
bitterness
just
dominates
the
finish
over
faintly
sweet

it
has
a
light
lively
zesty
quality
and
stays
interesting
it
is
a
bit
on
the
dryish
side
aspecially
after
the
first
taste
however
flavours
become
a
little
muted
and
its
slightly
on
the
muted
watery
side
after
the
first
few
sips
easily
sessional
enjoyed
with
corn
tamales
overall
not
bad
but
more
then
average
would
be
an
accurate
way
to
describe
it
i
have
had
more
then
better
in
the
style
but
still
nothing
to
really
knock
on
it
as
it
was
definitely
very
solid
d
not
my
first
choice
for
an
organic
pilsener

a
good

from
a
brown
bottle
at

temperature
mid
40s
f
appeared
yellow
hazy
with
about
1
inch
of
tight
foam
the
beer
initially
presented
a
malty
grainy
aroma
and
sweet
taste
with
just
enough
hops
to
balance
as
the
beer
warmed
it
seemed
slightly
drier
maybe
a
bit
astringent
maybe
the
hops
coming
through

poured
a

pils
with
a
good

foamy

with
good
retention
and
minimal

aroma
of

with
a
light

and
some
crisp

also
noticeable
taste
is
a
mix
between
some
floral
malt
with
some
distinctive
hops
from
plzen
full

with
some
great
carbonation
i
thought
it
may
have
been
a

it
was

its

it
was
a
little

at
4
16
oz
bottle
but
i
can
see
this
in
my
fridge
in
the
future
one
of
the
beers
my
wife
and
i
tried
at
the
dundee
dell
in
omaha
ne
and
one
of
the
most
memorable
i
liked
this
more
than
i
expected
the
color
was
a
hazycloudy
straw
poured
into
a
tall
glass
it
had
a
puffy
head
that
vanished
rather
quickly
but
left
behind
a
nice
aroma
of
lemon
and
hops
initially
it
was
rather
cold
and
the
carbonation
had
a
lot
of
bite
to
it
as
did
the
hops
but
as
it
warmed
up
the
bite
mellowed
the
body
smoothed
out
and
a
lovely
honey
flavor
emerged
a
good
find
as
were
two
other
pinkus
beers
we
tried
nice
label
too
very
drinkable
an
awesome
german
pils
purchased
plaza
liquors
tucson
az
i
am
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
or
lagers
but
this
offering
is
completely
different
than
any
pils
ive
had
much
more
bready
and
toasty
like
champagne
yet
with
a
sublime
finish
that
pursues
way
longer
than
it
should
this
is
the
first
pils
ever
to
last
as
long
as
this
one
well
worth
the
money
and
usda
certification
pours
a
cloudy
golden
color
with
orange
hues
and
a
1
finger
white
head
with
lots
of
little
bubbles
and
dark
colored
sediment
rising
up
the
glass
aromas
are
packed
with
yeast
banana
cloves
and
fruity
esters
up
front
flavors
of
lemony
hops
and
malt
are
very
well
balanced
yielding
to
the
banana
flavor
which
finishes
dry
and
sweet
well
carbonated
light
bodied
this
is
a
clean
very
easy
drinking
pilsener
total
2850
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
of
the
style
nothing
too
extraordinary
but
nothing
to
critique
either
the
fact
it
is
brewed
organically
is
a
plus
smells
of
lemon
malt
and
hopps
were
sweet
and
strong
had
a
better
aroma
than
taste
and
i
was
kind
of
disappointed
with
that
taste
is
strong
of
hopps
and
sweet
malt
might
be
a
bit
of
honey
too
i
think
the
after
taste
was
stronger
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
good
overall
but
this
beer
kind
of
fell
flat
in
the
end
notes
was
surprised
with
this
one
its
richer
and
more
complex
than
most
pils
but
without
compromising
drinkability
drinkability
is
average
not
my
favorite
pils
i
like
the
fuller
flavor
but
would
prefer
less
fermentation
byproducts
it
really
reminds
me
of
another
beer
that
i
havent
had
in
while
and
cant
place
maybe
urquell
a
decent
bottle
of
pilsner
glad
i
purchased
this
on
a
whim
overall
an
extremely
enjoyable
organic
pilsner
mmmm
certainly
smells
like
a
pils
grassy
herbal
hops
with
lightly
baked
biscuits
the
flavor
matches
with
a
crisp
dry
bitterness
citrus
rind
a
slight
malt
sweetness
and
mineral
note
the
appearance
is
a
clear
brilliant
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
this
is
very
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
yet
full
flavored
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
german
pils
yum
this
pils
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
thick
but
not
persistent
head
aroma
is
richly
malty
with
a
fruity
hint
flavor
is
fully
malty
with
a
whisper
of
sweetness
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
as
a
nice
counterpoint
as
well
as
some
hints
of
apple
texture
is
very
smooth
more
like
a
cider
than
a
pilsner
and
there
is
a
little
hop
flavor
in
the
aftertaste
not
stunningly
great
or
anything
but
nice
on
a
warm
march
afternoon
not
exactly
what
youd
expect
in
a
pilsner
but
tasty
nonetheless
pours
a
lightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
head
of
large
white
bubbles
sweet
grainy
aroma
comes
through
in
the
flavor
as
well
a
general
perfume
quality
light
body
but
the
perfume
quality
gets
old
towards
the
end
not
as
refreshing
as
i
would
like
in
a
pilsner
drinkability
not
very
representative
of
the
style
but
quite
tasty
cloudy
yellow
similar
to
a
hefeweizen
little
bit
of
white
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
smell
is
mostly
of
the
yeast
which
is
much
like
a
mild
hefeweizen
light
spiced
smelling
yeast
taste
is
some
spiced
yeast
a
touch
of
malt
and
almost
no
bitterness
i
guess
i
prefer
my
beer
nonorganic
because
this
isnt
doing
much
for
me
this
does
not
taste
like
a
pilsner
to
me
tastes
more
like
an
american
wheat
not
what
i
was
expecting
and
not
something
i
care
for
although
it
is
drinkable
i
cant
see
ever
having
the
opportunity
to
drink
this
for
free
anywhere
so
i
probably
wont
be
having
this
beer
again
nothing
special
this
pours
a
nice
kinda
cloudy
yellow
with
a
beautiful
head
nice
blend
of
hops
and
malt
and
citrus
more
like
a
hefe
than
i
have
noticed
in
many
pilsners
the
finish
is
very
hoppy
at
first
and
then
sweet
the
carbonation
and
bite
is
also
very
strong
this
is
a
very
good
beer
drinkability
high
definitely
a
good
session
beer
all
around
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
from
pinkus
i
dont
know
if
i
would
spend
3
50
on
another
pint
at
home
but
i
sure
wouldnt
pass
one
up
if
offered
pours
a
cloudy
straw
with
a
white
head
nose
is
a
hint
towards
lemongrass
white
grapes
flavor
is
light
and
refreshing
with
a
sweet
and
soft
tang
that
stays
fairly
constant
while
delivering
a
lot
of
citrus
tones
feel
is
pretty
decent
nice
bubble
on
it
very
drinkable
smooth
and
even
just
probably
not
my
style
or
something
i
would
prefer
to
go
for
again
for
me
the
lemon
flavors
come
out
way
too
much
for
it
to
be
a
repeat
performance
standard
pilsner
crispy
fruity
with
a
dry
finish
good
mouthfeel
with
just
the
right
amount
of
carbonation
found
the
flavors
to
be
very
mild
and
it
took
a
lot
of
sips
to
really
get
the
full
feel
of
this
brew
i
dont
think
the
orgainic
status
made
this
beer
any
better
or
any
worse
i
just
think
the
beer
on
the
whole
is
average
and
a
good
clean
representation
of
this
style
worth
a
try
d
a
unique
pils
the

flavors
are
unusual
but
good

pours
a
very
pale

with
a
small

aroma
is
somewhat
skunky
but
not
too
much
i
can
smell
a
nice
combination
of
malt
and
sweetness
still
taste
is
very
much
of
the
same
a
nice
smooth
malt
sweetness
that
leaves
a
sweet
aftertaste
in
the
back
of
the
throat
its
quite
drinkable
and
goes
down
well
light
and
refreshing
and
organic
as
well
not
too
bad
drinkability
this
was
a
nice
beer
easy
to
drink
and
nice
taste
if
you
like
the
style
you
wont
be
overjoyed
but
you
wont
be
disapponted
either
remeber
its
the
weight
of
my
heart
not
the
size
prosit
the
taste
is
pretty
good
but
has
minimal
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
dry
light
and
refreshing
i
think
this
is
a
good
pilsner
and
would
drink
again
toasted
grain
flavors
give
a
crispness
to
the
body
thats
quickly
washed
away
by
a
heavier
biscuit
malt
and
slight
caramel
notes
crispness
of
the
body
which
was
present
at
first
returns
and
sits
well
into
the
finish
dry
in
the
finish
with
a
biting
mouthfeel
that
prickles
the
roof
of
the
mouth
theres
a
touch
of
butter
in
the
mouth
but
it
evaporated
quit
quickly
a
nice
pils
that
id
have
again
if
given
the
chance
nothing
that
blew
me
away
however
very
drinkable
session
brew
interesting
flavour
and
look
to
it
but
not
sure
ill
run
out
and
buy
another
certainly
prefer
their
hefe
to
this
overall
not
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
but
a
good
one
nevertheless
this
example
has
probably
suffered
due
to
age
worth
a
try
dthis
is
a
good
beer
the
unfiltered
aspect
of
the
brewing
makes
this
a
sort
of
hefepilsener
the
appearence
and
smell
would
probably
be
better
were
it
not
for
the
long
transatlantic
voyage
i
will
seek
this
one
out
in
germany
when
i
am
there
overall
a
nice
and
hearty
unfiltered
pils
very
drinkable
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
very
nice
balance
of
malt
sweetness
tempered
by
the
dryness
of
the
hops
actually
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
hard
to
compare
to
a
typical
german
pils
there
is
very
little
of
that
light
refreshing
malt
and
saaz
hop
bite
that
i
would
expect
this
is
one
is
higher
on
malt
to
the
point
were
it
almost
taste
like
a
bock
i
imagine
this
is
what
differentiates
a
pils
from
an
urpils
i
really
dig
it
but
not
in
the
way
i
expected
very
light
but
hazy
yellow
thin
white
head
and
lots
of
bubbles
nose
is
grain
and
old
moldy
corn
musty
like
a
barn
taste
is
mild
and
pleasant
grains
and
a
funky
hoppy
ending
maybe
with
some
anise
mouthfeel

very
thin
drinkability
is
average

backed
with

i

the

it

the

i

i
dont

this

very

and
worthy

it
is
quite
easy
on
the
palate
and
enjoyable
i
look
forward
to
trying
more
pilseners
this
was
my
first
organic
beer
and
i
really
enoyed
it
there
wasnt
smell
there
wasnt
much
head
and
there
wasnt
much
lace
all
that
said
and
done
it
tasted
good
i
got
a
couple
pinkus
from
a
deli
and
im
pretty
stoked
for
the
next
one

review
organic
ur
pils
pours
a
hazy
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
just
a
bit
of
malt
the
flavor
is
similar
grassy
hops
matched
nicely
against
some
malt
not
a
bad
choice
certainly
worth
a
try
beaten
gold
body
and
very
bright
white
head
that
dissipates
a
touch
too
quickly
aromas
are
of
pears
on
the
fruit
side
along
with
some
earthiness
and
a
bit
of
saltiness
that
came
out
at
higher
temperatures
on
the
tongue
bready
malts
first
assert
themselves
then
give
way
to

fruit
and
zesty
hops
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
finish
zesty
very
carbonated
mouthfeel
with
a
touch
of
acidity
overall
a
very
smooth
easy
liked
beer
that
was
very
nice
in
the
elements
it
presented
but
lacking
a
bit
in
the
variety
of
elements
it
puts
forward
despite
complexities
and
richness
it
had
a
light
feel
to
it
that
made
it
feel
refreshing
very
smooth
the
unfiltered
quality
gave
it
more
of
a
body
than
most
pilseners
fresh
clean
complex
and
unique
its
about
as
good
as
a
german
pilsner
gets
rich
firm
pilsner
malts
with
light
grainy
flavors
a
light
citrus
apple
character
evident
in
the
aroma
and
flavor
and

crispness
in
the
finish
hopped
for
a
mild

without
pushing
the
gravity
too
high
remains
light
and
fresh
throughout
nice
beer
drinks
pretty
easy
but
just
a
slightly
above
average
german
pils
imo
i
can
think
of
a
dozen
others
id
rather
have
i
had
the
organic
urpils
which
is
apparently
a
different
name
for
this
same
beer
pours
to
a
hazy
yellow
with
suspended
particles
and
a
creamy
offwhite
head
flavor
is
mostly
hoppy
with
a
hint
of
malt
caramel
fairly
dry
especially
midway
thru
the
glass
but
overall
a
good
tasting
beer
with
a
decent
finish
easy
enough
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
evening
although
not
much
more
than
a
thirst
quencher
i
found
pinkus
to
be
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
another
german
newbie
to
alberta
this
pinkus
pils
comes
in
the
500ml
bluelabelled
bottle
organic
sticker
on
the
neck
i
do
believe
this
is
my
first
time
ever
trying
an
unfiltered
pilsner
i
have
never
seen
that
before
pinkus
urpils
pours
out
a
slightly
cloudy
lighthoney
colour
with
hints
of
lemonadeyellow
the
head
is
initially
very
large
and
healthy
styrofoamwhite
and
billowy
with
an
icecream
consistency
good
lace
as
attractive
as
a
pils
can
be
by
the
end
is
looks
like
a
hefe
in
the
glass
nice
very
light
fruitiness
smelling
above
the
glass
almost
limelike
in
closer
is
some
excellent
creamysweet
malting
adding
some
faint
vanilla
and
grains
grassy
continental
hops
are
here
in
good
quanity
but
the
beer
smells
very
sweet
almost
sugary
at
times
with
plenty
of
orangepeel
and
lemon
notes
after
pouring
again
for
some
more
head
the
aroma
is
vaguely
spicy
and
full
of
sourish
malting
not
overwhelming
in
complexity
just
very
appetising
the
taste
is
very
light
with
some
citrus
salinity
and
bready
malting
with
only
a
little
finishing
dryness
and
balanced
grassy
hops
on
the
follow
through
lots
of
lemon
in
the
taste
and
fairly
watery
malting
altogether
the
taste
is
far
too
sweet
and
unhopped
for
a
good
pilsner
definitely
uncomplex
really
nothing
more
to
describe
very
smooth
mouthfeel
and
very
low
in
carbonation
light
bodied
extremely
drinkable
too
just
not
interesting
enough
to
register
more
than
a
blip
on
my
pilsnerscale
i
found
this
a
good

it

10
minutes

earthy
the
taste
is
smooth
but
it
lacks
any
kick
as
it
heats
up
the
sweet
smooth
malt
becomes
even
sweeter
not
for
the
better
because
it
leaves
a
film
the
smooth
texture
make
this
one
go
down
easy
it
is
enjoyable
and
it
has
some
bright
points
overall
a
pretty
nice
beer
id
be
happy
to
have
in
any
biergarten
on
a
warm
day
i
would
recommend
trying
this
beer
at
your
next
opportunity
organic
and
unfiltered
pinkus
urpils
is
a
prime
example
of
a
german
biobier
whereas
you
may
not
buy
into
the
organic
aspect
the
unfiltered
aspect
of
this
beer
means
none
of
the
flavor
has
been
stripped
away
the
resulting
sensory
experience
is
definitely
rewarding
not
a
bad
beer
not
a
great
one
i
had
higher
expectations
here
very
drinkable
and
mighty
thirst
quenching
one
of
the
better
german
pilsners
ive
had
to
date
pours
a
hazy
light
apricot
hue
lazy
carbonation
with
a
lot
of
suspended
particles
hence
the
unfiltered
statement
right
on
the
label
a
quick
shock
of
pure
white
head
tops
it
off
and
falls
to
a
fairly
thick
creamy
cap
mild
grainy
malts
on
the
nose
bready
with
light
grassy
hops
the
flavour
is
hit
and
miss
in
my
books
light
watery
flavour
up
front
the
flavour
really
never
does
pick
up
you
get
traces
of
bready
malt
some
spice
and
some
very
faint
floral
hops
but
not
really
in
one
cohesive
package
it
truly
does
taste
like
its
been
watered
down
in
general
the
mouthfeel
as
well
no
surprise
is
very
light
bodied
and
watery
with
only
a
quick
rip
of
carbonation
across
the
tongue
on
the
finish
which
does
not
positively
contribute
to
the
overall
experience
very
waifish
for
a
pilsner
even
an
organic
one
this
is
a
total
wallflower
very
easy
to
overlook
and
with
good
reason
a
pass
on
this
one
next
time
a
pleasant
surprise
as
my
first
experiance
with
pinkus
wasnt
so
pleasant
this
would
make
a
fine
fair
weather
beer
very
quaffable
overall
a
very
pleasant
and
highly
drinkable
german
pils
beers
of
this
style
pilsners
in
general
tend
to
be
undervalued
when
it
comes
down
to
this
rating
stuff
but
theres
something
to
be
said
for
wellmade
cleanly
drinkable
beers
like
this
one
would
make
a
terriffic
session
beer
overall
not
my
favorite
of
the
style
but
is
good
i
really
do
think
this
beer
would
be
paired
very
well
with
many
types
of
food
i
keep
thinking
of
a
steak
while
drinking
this
md
overall
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
soft
throughout
and
carbonation
feels
quite
balanced
on
the
palate
this
mediumbodied
german
pils
is
distinctive
from
most
other
samples
of
this
style
ive
tasted
it
has
more
delicate
elements
in
it
and
is
not
just
superficially
glossed
over
with
a
dash
of
hopsmaybe
also
due
to
the
fact
that
its
unfiltered
i
truly
like
this
beer
drinkability
sure
its
drinkable
but
not
really
memorable
kinda
neat
in
that
it
is
an
unfiltered
pilsner
and
organic
i
can
at
least
say
i
have
had
something
good
for
me
today
this
pils
poured
into
my
glass
mug
a
slightly
cloudy
yellow
decent
head
and
carbonation
whoa
this
smells
different
from
your
average
pils
crisp
and
dry
taste
more
flavorful
than
your
average
bulk
pils
thats
for
sure
the
hops
are
not
overwhelming
and
i
like
that
this
is
a
really
drinkable
pilsner
interesting
mellow
citrus
notes
in
the
taste
with
a
faint
hop
bitterness
to
finsh
out
the
clean
crisp
presence
on
my
pallette
no
aftertaste
to
speak
of
but
the
carbonation
leaves
me
with
just
a
slight
tingle
on
my
tongue
overall
a
well
done
beer
perfect
for
the
warmer
summer
months
an
enjoyable
yet
overly
simple
and
onedimensional
beer
i
dont
really
see
a
reason
to
drink
this
if
i
want
a
pils
ill
get
one
this
tastes
more
like
a
sophomoric
american
pale
ale
yeastybreadcitrus
aroma
up
front
almost
heffe
like
in
some
ways
as
its
an
unfiltered
pils
except
i
dont
smell
or
taste
any
sweet
fruits
just
citrus
and
yeastbready
fairly
solid
body
with
a
crisp
dry
finish
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
very
refreshing
and
cleansing
its
possibly
a
nice
transition
beer
for
your
fellow
bmc
friends
this
is
what
an
organic
beer
should
be
like
while
many
beers
have
grassy
qualities
to
them
this
is
like
some
wellcultivated
and
carefully
maintained
greenery
in
a
glass
nice
mellow
hoppiness
and
crispness
make
this
a
pils
that
is
definitely
worth
checking
out
even
if
you
generally
find
the
style
unexciting
an
odd
pilsner
as
some
others
pointed
out
tastes
more
like
a
lager
it
tastes
like
something
ive
had
before
but
i
cant
remember
what
maybe
a
baltic
lager
not
the
usual
hop
bite
of
a
pils
kind
of
bready
and
dry
appearance
typical
and
certainly
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
if
youre
looking
for
a
more
standard
pils
skip
this
nice
for
something
different
one
of
the
better
organic
brews
ive
had
this
is
an
amazing
interpretation
of
the
style
found
it
much
different
than
the
other
pilsners
that
ive
tried
ill
definitely
be
having
more
this
is
one
hell
of
a
pilsner
is
all
i
can
say
if
you
see
a
bottle
pick
it
up
and
buy
it
drinkability
while
not
a
great
pils
the
monster
nose
makes
it
interesting
enough
to
recommend
not
superb
but
novel
and
solid
a
crisp
middle
of
the
road
german
pils
nothing
unpleasant
besides
the
semibleach
flavored
aftertaste
not
my
favorite
style
so
i
probably
wont
be
returning
to
this
one
but
a
decent
pils
with
most
of
the
styles
traditional
character
this
is
a
great
beer
for
this
current
sweltering
weather
it
would
be
a
little
too
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
both
fortunately
and
unfortunately
i
have
only
the
one
bottle
nice
hazy
appearance
fits
in
with
the
earthy
organic
theme
i
was
kind
of
surprised
it
was
so
hazy
maybe
a
bit
malted
wheat
in
the
background
smell
has
a
hint
of
noble
hop
and
spicy
phenol
sniff
tastes
like
a
german
pils
very
clean
with
a
stiff
noble
hop
flavor
the
carbonation
is
perfect
at
medium
medium
high
this
is

one
of
the
better

pilseners
ive
had
i
should
note
that
i
am
not
in
a
huge
hurry
to
seek
this
one
out
again
but
it
is
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
see
it
drinkability
i
cant
believe
it
two
pils
in
a
row
that
i
actually
like
and
would
consider
having
again
this
beer
has
tons
of
different
flavors
and
stuff
going
on
try
it
and
see
what
you
think
i
guess
organic
is
a
good
thing
in
beer
too
ok
oddly
enough
this
beer
tastes
better
close
to
55
deg
f
not
expected
for
a
pils
the
lemon
zest
in
the
bitterness
comes
out
more
then
overall
not
bad
but
rather
boring
hey
at
least
it
is
organic
that
means
something
right
drinkability

much
better
than
their
effort
at
an
organic
hefe
weizen
ur
pils
is
a
unique
take
on
the
style
the
progression
from
a
modestly
sweet
beginning
to
a
parchingly
dry
bitter
finish
is
interesting
but
is
a
phrase
that
i
hope
doesnt
end
up
on
my
headstone
although
pilseners
cant
be
counted
among
my
favorite
styles
this
one
is
a
keeper
body
is
very
hazy
most
likely
from
the
lack
of
filtering
dark
gold
slightly
orange
color
with
a
big
white
head
that
quickly
fades
into
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
on
the
surface
has
a
very
pungent
malt
smell
slightly
grassy
but
is
obviously
no
slouch
like
many
of
its
euro
lager
counterparts
yeastiness
in
the
nose
taste
is
sharp
grassy
malt
that
fades
to
a
satisfying
hop
finish
carbonation
accentuates
this
beer
perfectly
slight
metallic
twang
in
the
aftertaste
which
doesnt
hurt
the
flavor
that
much
good
beer
tonight
turned
out
to
be
german
pils
night
as
ive
just
finished
a
allgäuer
büble
bier
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
i
had
not
yet
reviewed
the
pinkus
ur
pils
since
ive
had
it
so
many
times
before
i
pick
this
up
regularly
grocery
shopping
at
wegmans
the
unfiltered
pils
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
gold
head
is
substantial
upon
initial
pour
an
enduring
layer
of
foam
is
left
behind
faint
fruit
aromas
are
detected
some
pear
and
green
apple
flavor
is
rather
subtle
light
grain
imparting
a
sourdough
bread
essence
hops
are
leafy
grassy
and
biting
leaving
a
welcome
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
light
and
with
crisp
carbonation
good
drinkability
and
a
solid
brew
yellow
classic
german
pilsner
aroma
with
pils
malt
light
fruits
clove
honey
herbal
spicy
and
grassy
hops
a
very
pleasant
tasting
pils
especially
up
front
and
on
the
midpalate
grainy
fruity
malty
texture
notes
of
clove
light
fruits
bananas
pears
and
honey
the
hops
are
subtle
which
is
why
i
liked
it
grassy
and
herbal
the
onlu
complaint
is
the
poor
finish
nontheless
this
is
an
impressive
pilsner
this
is
easily
consumable
beer
it
is
also
interesting
enough
to
warrant
more
tastings
i
like
this
am
wondering
if
its
more
along
the
lines
of
a
kellerbier
as
it
is
unfiltered
lovely
light
tangerine
in
my
pilsner
glass
i
received
a
lovely
two
inch
snow
white
head
after
pouring
its
gone
now
with
just
a
thin
layer
on
top
of
the
brew
i
really
like
the
aroma
on
this
one
its
decidedly
spicey
and
perfumey
and
a
bit
bready
as
well
mouthfeel
wise
is
medium
good
carbonation
spot
on
enough
but
not
too
much
tastewise
you
get
your
moneys
worth
the
malt
is
a
hanging
in
the
back
so
you
experience
an
initial
perfumey
note
again
with
some
citrusy
notes
in
the
finish
unique
and
tasty
would
love
to
get
on
draft
if
possible
an
odd
mustyness
throws
it
off
style
kind
of
a
weird
beer
more
of
a
kellerbier
maybe
the
beer
is
cloudy
gold
in
color
topped
by
a
respectable
creamy
white
head
smells
very
grainy
with
perhaps
some
mild
fruity
aromas
a
sweet
malt
flavor
to
start
masterfully
balanced
by
bitter
but
not
too
bitter
hops
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
overall
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
pilsner
that
really
stands
out
from
the
rest
the
taste
is
perfectly
sweet
and
musty
an
excellent
sharp
bitterness
melds
into
a
sweet
but
dry
graininess
theres
a
solid
body
of
pungent
and
grainy
malt
this
is
very
close
to
my
perfect
pilsner
sharp
with
the
fresh
grains
accented
which
all
pilsners
really
should
have
a
benchmark
beer
excellent
the
beer
pours
a
cloudy
pale
gold
color
with
a
lot
of
floaties
and
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
light
yet
malty
scent
with
a
musty
dry
aroma
it
has
a
bit
of
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
smooth
bitter
flavor
with
a
malty
hop
aftertaste
it
is
a
dry
musty
brew
with
good
mouthfeel
it
is
medium
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
german
pilsner
it
has
excellent
flavor
and
mouthfeel
a
good
drinker
ng
the
taste
is
excellent
for
a
pilsner
but
this
isnt
your
ordinary
pils
tart
citrusy
lemon
is
smooth
on
the
palate
and
matches
very
well
with
the
sweet
pilsner
malt
backbone
apple
and
pear
notes
appear
early
on
and
lend
an
amazing
complexity
to
this
organic
pils
finish
is
crisp
and
very
clean
i
love
this
offering
and
plan
to
stock
up
several
of
these
at
my
next
opportunity
i
saw
this
interesting
beer
and
had
to
try
it
an
organic
unfiltered
pilsner
pours
a
hazy
gold
which
is
exactly
what
i
expected
has
the
same
plisner
flavor
but
the
bitterness
is
slighty
muted
nice
flavor
and
comes
in
a
brown
bottle
which
is
nice
considering
the
high
skunk
factor
in
green
bottle
imported
pilsners
overall
a
nice
beer
highly
drinkable
i
reccomend
this
trying
to
remember
if
ive
ever
had
an
unfiltered
pilsener
before
poured
a
hazy
gold
a
bit
brighter
and
less
hazy
than
a
hefeweizen
but
not
far
off
the
beer
was
a
bit
on
the
acidic
side
but
this
did
not
translate
into
any
particular
tartness
yeasty
flavors
clove
in
particular
much
like
those
found
in
a
hefeweizen
unusual
and
interesting
for
some
reason
the
beer
did
not
totally
engage
me
but
it
was
certainly
worth
the
try
pours
a
hazy
yellow
gold
with
a
moderate
pure
white
head
that
settles
quickly
leaving
a
thin
lace
smells
are
grainy
light
malt
with
a
descernable
bready
yeast
and
acidic
hops
taste
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
low
level
acidic
flavors
over
an
unfiltered
grainy
malt
which
quickly
gives
way
to
pure
acidic
hop
not
a
very
complex
taster
but
a
very
nice
session
brew
if
you
atre
in
the
mood
for
an
acidic
pils
canbonation
is
quite
perfect
not
overbearing
but
bubbly
refreshing
and
complementary
to
the
general
feel
of
the
beer
real
drinkable
brew
practically
a
meal
in
a
bottle
tastepretty
good
and
pretty
complex
salty
and
slightly
metalic
notes
give
way
to
sweet
munich
malts
which
are
quickly
overcome
by
a
fine
selection
of
hops
in
the
finish
interesting
yeast
notes
fruity
mushroomy
provide
counterpoint
taste
is
ok
not
as
crisp
as
i
would
expect
a
pilsener
a
bit
more
creamy
and
rounded
not
very
crisp
and
not
much
hop
profile
here
a
fruity
sourness
with
some
very
light
hops
in
the
finish
not
bad
but
nothing
that
stands
out
to
my
taste
decent
drinker
but
not
one
ill
seek
out
again
my
sample
had
lots
of
yeast
sediment
rarely
do
i
leave
beer
in
the
bottle
i
did
on
this
occasion
and
i
left
beer
in
the
glass
there
was
a
lot
of
yeast
image
a
chronic
case
of
dandruff
this
organic
pils
marches
to
a
beat
of
a
different
brewer
it
pours
a
dull
gold
color
with
a
nice
sturdy
white
head
and
plenty
of
lace
an
aroma
of
fresh
bread
malt
hops
and
citrus
lasts
theres
more
body
than
one
normally
associates
with
the
pils
style
the
hops
are
a
bit
spicier
and
less
metallic
than
most
pils
a
light
herbal
flavor
mingles
with
a
hint
of
lime
and
a
bit
of
alcohol
if
i
were
blindfolded
i
would
have
guessed
someone
had
tried
to
blend
a
hefeweizen
with
an
alt
hmmm
very
different
i
just
finished
a
scrimshaw
pilsener
and
then
sampled
this
offering
it
seemed
much
more
like
a
wheat
offering
than
a
pilsener
head
was
nice
and
wellformed
clinged
to
the
side
of
glass
a
bit
smell
was
slightly
hoppy
and
fruity
taste
was
light
but
full
bodied
leaving
a
pleasant
slight
tart
aftertaste
drinkability
was
very
good
going
down
smooth
with
a
nice
aftertaste
i
wasnt
expecting
the
results
i
found
it
wasnt
as
pilsener
tasting
as
i
expected
it
was
much
more
rounded
like
some
of
the
ales
i
have
sampled
this
brew
poured
a
medium
white
head
of
finely
sized
bubbles
that
left
very
little
lacing
as
it
receded
it
had
a
mild
aroma
of
hops
and
malt
and
a
wheat
yellow
cloudy
body
with
yeast
floating
in
it
it
has
a
mild
initial
bite
that
smoothens
in
the
finish
its
flavor
was
a
bit
fizzy
and
hoppy
500
ml
bottle
poured
a
cloudy
straw
yellow
with
a
fairly
decent
head
that
quickly
faded
aroma
is
slightly
malty
and
of
fresh
cut
hay
taste
is
very
mellow
low
carbonation
and
just
plain
mild
i
kept
waiting
for
more
that
just
isnt
there
not
a
bad
beer
i
could
drink
this
as
a
session
beer
but
i
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
body
to
it
first
of
all
i
was
not
too
impressed
with
this
pilsener
i
just
could
not
quite
acquire
a
taste
for
this
one
it
poured
a
white
creamy
head
there
was
no
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
beer
the
body
was
cloudy
and
the
hue
was
yellow
the
yeast
was
visible
in
my
glass
it
had
a
sweet
aroma
to
it
i
totally
expected
this
to
be
a
dudall
dusty
as
it
was
sitting
sideways
on
the
proprietors
shelf
next
to
the
hot
fridge
exhaust
but
ill
be
darned
this
is
one
of
the
best
damn
pilseners
ive
ever
eaten
poured
huge
and
foamy
with
a
monstersofrock
head
that
sat
up
like
stiff
egg
whites
the
aroma
was
so
lubricious
and
slippery
with
protien
that
i
almost
suspected
the
suspect
isinglass
fish
guts
to
be
in
there
but
the
body
reveals
otherwise
nice
hoppy
punch
in
the
nose
with
that
dark
musty
bottomofthebarrel
englishipa
sort
of
vibe
but
more
in
line
with
the
spirit
of
the
truly
heavenly
malt
body
that
this
beer
posesses
scrumptious
as
all
getout
opaque
dark
gold
with
a
nice
and
bright
head
of
14
inch
of
consistantsized
small
bubbles
laces
in
sheets
in
a
pilsner
glass
slightly
dusty
and
nutty
aromas
sense
of
late
summer
harvests
grassy
and
toasty
malts
very
flavorful
in
combination
and
yet
restrained
overall
light
body
is
well
matched
by
a
lack
of
overcarbonation
finishes
crisply
but
without
a
notable
hop
assertion
minimal
to
no
aftertaste
this
is
the
last
of
the
pinkus
selection
at
my
store
i
must
say
that
im
impressed
by
each
as
unique
in
their
style
while
still
conforming
to
overall
style
characteristics
another
great
product
from
pinkus
my
first
actual
unfiltered
pils
and
looks
similar
to
their
weizen
but
a
little
less
cloudy
nice
big
white
foamy
head
though
like
the
weizen
has
im
not
that
big
on
pils
but
i
must
say
this
is
a
good
one
great
clean
crisp
flavorful
beer
classic
pils
malts
and
only
slight
bitterness
im
surprised
this
isnt
rated
higher
its
a
quality
brew
poured
nicely
with
orangeyellow
huewith
pretty
good
rocky
head
nice
balanced
smell
with
a
nice
crisp
hop
tonealso
a
little
breadlike
i
like
the
maltiness
of
this
pilsner
some
overhop
for
the
style
but
not
this
one
the
hop
came
through
but
it
was
not
to
promident
was
pretty
drinkablei
have
had
better
but
this
wasnt
bad
at
all
cloudy
golden
color
with
a
pure
white
head
that
retained
decently
lacing
was
spotty
at
best
grainy
bready
malty
taste
that
was
nice
and
smooth
easy
to
have
a
few
of
these
very
refreshing
as
a
this
genre
should
be
one
of
the
better
beers
of
this
style
that
i
have
had
the
malts
are
arranged
beautifully
with
a
hop
balance
that
just
makes
this
beer
a
great
brew
it
has
light
carbonation
enough
to
make
it
crisp
it
is
very
smooth
with
a
medium
to
light
body
the
drinkability
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
of
em
this
is
a
fine
pils
that
is
a
must
try
for
any
beer
drinker
the
pour
is
a
somewhat
obscure
golden
yellow
to
amber
color
the
head
is
portly
in
size
frothy
in
its
texture
with
the
lace
quite
thick
and
sticky
sheets
to
cling
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
the
light
musk
or
musty
tone
noticed
in
this
beer
as
with
most
organic
beers
not
unpleasant
and
sometimes
just
barely
discernable
you
really
need
to
hunt
them
down
malt
and
crisp
fresh
and
clean
to
the
palate
start
malt
and
sweet
the
top
middling
in
feel
the
finish
crisply
acidic
passably
hopped
with
a
very
dry
lingering
aftertaste
and
a
pleasant
enough
beer
worth
the
sample
in
my
humble
opinion
different
appearance
for
a
pilsner
hazy
yellow
relatively
light
bodied
and
medium
head
with
good
carbonation
not
as
hoppy
as
i
expected
but
malts
to
start
with
a
slightly
hoppy
finish
better
as
a
summer
beer
hazy
yellow
with
a
fine
frosty
head
that
crawls
up
the
glass
with
authority
the
nose
is
quite
ripe
with
sugary
candied
dried
fruit
gum
drops
and
haribo
candy
there
is
a
faint
whiff
of
alfalfa
sprouts
too
rich
full
texture
is
hewn
into
shape
by
bitter
hops
big
chewy
rustic
flavor
featuring
notes
of
lemon
watercress
and
chervil
seriously
unique
pils
quite
hazy
bottle
conditioned
golden
with
a
creamy
14
head
that
holds
excellently
and
leaves
some
good
lace
the
aroma
is
of
a
sweetly
floral
and
grassy
hop
thats
lightly
backed
by
malt
excellent
the
body
is
medium
with
a
very
fine
and
lightly
effervescent
carbonation
that
gently
caresses
the
tongue
and
becomes
quite
creamy
as
it
warms
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
starts
with
a
great
blend
of
rich
sweet
malt
and
a
unique
floral
hop
flavor
thats
at
least
partially
from
hallertauer
the
sweet
malt
decreases
as
it
crosses
the
palate
revealing
some
more
grassy
hop
flavors
and
some
bitterness
it
finishes
dry
and
fairly
short
with
some
lingering
hop
flavor
and
light
bitterness
as
would
be
expected
of
a
good
pilsener
very
well
balanced
allowing
the
malt
and
hop
flavors
to
remain
clear
throughout
while
also
giving
an
enjoyable
bitter
bite
at
the
start
and
maintaining
enough
bitterness
to
keep
it
dry
and
refreshing
extremely
well
done
however
i
must
note
that
its
important
to
obtain
a
fresh
sample
this
is
not
a
huge
seller
in
the
u
s
and
ive
had
many
old
damaged
bottles
before
i
came
across
this
fresh
one
i
should
also
note
that
all
merchant
du
vin
products
are
conspicuosly
absent
of
any
dating
sorry
charlie
but
you
know
its
true
hazy
yellow
in
hue
even
before
the
yeast
sediment
is
poured
the
billowy
white
attractive
persistent
head
leaves
a
good
lace
sweet
honey
and
cracker
notes
in
aroma
followed
by
a
pleasantly
herbal
noble
hop
nose
sharp
prickly
carbonation
and
hop
bitterness
hits
the
palette
at
first
but
fades
quickly
leaving
bready
notes
and
fairly
high
malt
sweetness
for
style
slightly
musty
hay
like
flavors
are
perceptible
as
well
hop
flavor
is
green
and
herbal
the
finish
is
just
a
touch
bitter
but
honey
like
sweetness
lingers
long
after
the
sip
this
is
an
odd
pilsner
but
an
interesting
beer
malt
sweetness
is
too
dominant
its
definitely
a
beer
worth
trying
however
notes
very
interesting
with
raw
complexities
packed
with
flavour
and
could
be
paired
with
numerous
types
of
foods
panasian
worked
best
poured
into
pint
glass
from
bottle
aggressive
pour
shows
two
fingers
eggshell
froth
with
fair
retention
and
some
spotty
lacing
clear
and
light
straw
in
color
light
yet
very
metallic
aromas
very
little
complexity
tastes
somewhat
skunky
not
really
picking
up
much
in
terms
of
noble
hops
quite
base
mouthfeel
is
watery
with
light
carbonation
and
a
metallic
finish
much
like
sucking
on
a
penny
i
was
quite
disappointed
with
this
beer
i
thought
it
was
from
germanynope
st
louis
this
does
not
taste
much
at
all
like
a
standard
pilsner
im
willing
to
bet
the
version
made
in
germany
tastes
quite
different
and
i
wish
i
could
differentiate
it
on
ba
from
the
american
brewery
the
only
one
listed
that
i
can
find
is
german
and
this
is
definitely
not
so
are
reviewers
in
germany
rating
a
completely
different
beer
if
anyone
knows
please
message
meim
confused
bought
on
sale
for
less
than
1bottle
even
for
same
price
will
not
buy
again
i
used
stay
in
los
angeles
sometime
back
my
staple
used
to
be
gordon
biersch
blonde
bock
used
be
a
very
nice
beer
with
excellent
body
color
and
taste
slightly
stronger
but
then
bock
are
meant
to
be
that
way
becks
was
my
other
favorite
different
beer
styles
but
fantastic
in
its
own
right
i
havent
tasted
a
better
lager
than
becks
but
then
i
havent
been
to
germany
the
beer
has
a
bit
of
a
sulfur
smell
and
is
bitter
but
i
like
it
and
its
distinct
flavor
again
i
think
in
a
blind
taste
test
it
would
do
better
product
of
usa
a
german
style
lager
quite
weak
in
taste
and
very
cheap
however
it
still
beats
most
local
beers
here
in
finland
by
its
competetive
price
and
taste
an
allaround
drinking
beer
very
inoffensive
nearly
tasteless
not
too
carbonated
beer
its
a
decent
cheap
option
if
on
sale
and
in
my
opinion
better
than
a
bud
light
or
miller
but
not
good
enough
to
justify
buying
it
if
its
significantly
more
than
those
options
this
is
a
real
drinking
beer
for
me
it
is
one
step
up
from
fosters
heiniken
miller
and
bud
nothing
special
but
better
than
some
of
the
other
global
brands
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
becks
again
but
in
a
tight
spot
or
given
to
me
i
would
happily
drink
and
enjoy
it
its
just
an
ok
decent
pilsner
i
guess
kinda
tastes
like
pee
pee
sláinte
watery
with
no
real
flavor
very
refreshing
and
one
of
my
favorite
german
pilsner
great
clear
color
and
best
if
its
ice
cold
smooth
and
clean
ingredients
wont
give
you
any
headaches
even
after
you
finish
6
bottles
by
yourself
overall
too
bland
almost
no
flavors
a
little
stale
missing
some
freshness
no
flavor
personally
i
dont
want
to
have
this
beer
again
way
too
carbonated
with
very
little
flavor
not
hoppy
at
all
it
feels
like
drinking
sparkling
water
struggled
to
finish
a
bottle
green
the
color
of
sickness
the
color
of
sallow
malevolence
this
beer
almost
always
comes
in
green
bottles
which
usually
is
indicative
of
skunky
goodness
my
best
intentions
led
me
to
purchase
this
brew
in
cans
which
led
me
down
a
path
of
darkness
and
pain
this
is
my
own
fault
and
i
abhor
creation
and
the
almighty
himself
for
the
suffering
invoked
after
a
night
of
consuming
this
blasphemous
nectar
i
awoke
with
a
head
pierced
by
a
dagger
of
molten
ore
and
pounding
fury
my
mouth
was
an
arid
dessicated
abyss
where
only
demons
and
harlots
dare
tread
all
of
this
in
the
name
of
teutonic
superiority
would
i
recommend
this
beer
if
you
wish
to
gaze
into
the
the
eyes
of
satan
then
wholeheartedly
not
a
completely
terrible
beer
i
just
prefer
more
flavor
in
my
beer
its
not
bad
id
only
buy
a
twelve
pack
of
it
if
its
on
sale
though
not
a
bad
beer
when
i
started
to
enjoy
more
flavor
to
my
beer
thats
when
i
left
stuff
like
this
alone
it
was
late
at
night
and
it
we
were
outside
looking
for
the
full
moon
found
the
bag
of
canned
becks
and
we
were
thirsty
from
running
the
last
2
miles
of
trail
the
air
was
cold
the
beer
was
cold
and
we
were
thirsty
aww
becks
the
right
beer
at
the
right
time
dont
drink
it
much
anymore
but
before
the
craft
beers
took
off
this
was
one
of
my
goto
beers
it
can
be
too
fizzy
granted
that
this
isnt
craft
beer
its
not
swill
either
i
remember
me
and
a
friend
getting
this
or
st
pauli
on
payday
back
in
the
stone
age
1980s
we
thought
we
were
pretty
darn
worldly
and
sophisticated
i
sometimes
still
like
beers
such
as
becks
or
heinies
for
the
lawnmowing
or
fence
painting
i
had
not
tried
a
becks
in
awhile
i
might
have
to
go
for
a
st
pauli
next
i
used
to
love
this
stuff
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
this
beer
is
pretty
good
overall
not
the
best
pilsener
i
have
had
by
a
pretty
large
margin
it
is
cheap
at
au39
a
case
so
take
your
pick
i
guess
ok
drinkable
only
buy
on
special
not
a
bad
beer
but
neither
what
i
expected
when
i
bought
it
as
an
imported
craft
beer
its
still
fresh
and
funny
to
drink
would
not
buy
an
importation
again
but
with
a
discount
or
in
germany
as
well
i
think
it
would
work
perfectly
at
a
party
for
me
as
you
can
tell
from
my
profile
picture
i
love
becks
it
so
simple
that
its
brilliant
i
first
had
a
becks
when
i
was
seventeen
and
i
have
loved
them
since
i
highly
recommend
these
and
all
of
their
other
flavours
the
flavor
has
a
crackery
pilsner
malt
taste
with
a
tad
of
bitterness
and
a
clean
feel
this
is
super
easy
to
drink
is
very
light
and
not
nearly
as
poor
as
one
would
believe
i
wished
they
had
other
german
beer
here
in
l
a
one
of
my
favorite
beers
light
but
almost
medium
mouthfeel
skunks
smell
but
in
a
good
way
good
carbonation
maybe
a
bit
much
bitter
but
smooth
very
good
beer
i
bought
it
walmart
in
a
12
pack
was
wanting
something
i
hadnt
had
before
first
i
have
to
admit
i
am
a
fan
of
ipa
and
strong
flavors
this
does
not
have
a
strong
flavor
it
had
good
carbonation
and
mouthfeel
almost
like
a
sprite
the
flavor
wasnt
there
none
zilch
if
someone
gave
it
to
me
i
would
drink
it
but
i
wont
buy
it
again
plain
old
budweiser
or
miller
has
beer
taste
than
this
i
expected
more
from
a
german
beer
and
now
i
feel
betrayed
let
down
and
disappointed
o
nothing
great
and
nothing
awful
overall
2
58
its
not
a
bad
beer
and
its
not
something
id
avoid
like
the
plague
i
just
would
probably
never
drink
it
again
unless
it
was
offered
to
me
for
free
its
just
got
this
linear
cornfest
thing
going
on
with
diaper
and
musty
barley
cant
shake
it
over
all
i
will
go
on
record
now
and
say
i
actually
do
like
becks
it
is
not
great
and
i
appreciate
that
but
it
is
a
pilsener
and
as
such
is
a
simple
brew
and
it
does
that
very
well
perfect
chilled
to
near
freezing
on
a
scorching
summers
day
a
highly
drinkable
number
and
i
find
it
to
be
very
refreshing
not
too
strong
which
also
makes
it
a
good
drink
for
a
night
on
the
tiles
if
you
know
everyone
else
is
going
to
get
messy
on
a
night
out
then
this
one
will
keep
you
in
the
game
till
only
you
are
left
standing
mind
the
hangover
though
cant
really
go
wrong
with
a
german
pilsener
not
great
but
in
a
place
with
shitty
beer
selection
this
stuff
isnt
too
bad
also
not
bad
at
german
restaurants
because
it
is
light
and
good
with
food
overall
just
a
complete
skunk
bomb
i
cant
believe
people
prefer
to
drink
this
party
beer
and
i
would
walk
past
it
if
it
wasnt
on
sale
pretty
standard
watery
beer
with
extra
skunk
added
my
review
is
short
because
there
is
simply
not
much
to
describe
pours
a
strawyellow
in
color
with
a
thin
white
head
that
settles
down
to
just
along
the
sides
of
the
glass
no
lacing
is
really
seen
just
a
bit
when
sipped
the
aroma
is
not
much
of
really
just
some
grains
not
skunky
though
like
so
many
that
come
in
a
green
bottle
for
some
reason
the
taste
is
pretty
much
the
same
just
of
some
grain
and
hops
not
bitter
but
just
plain
for
the
most
part
overall
it
is
ok
but
nothing
special
but
is
smooth
and
refreshing
bit
watereddown
though
o
this
beer
isnt
as
bad
as
many
make
it
out
to
be
but
not
as
good
as
i
remember
overall
not
a
great
beer
and
one
that
i
would
only
drink
if
it
was
free
at
a
party
appeareance
is
a
darkish
straw
color
not
much
to
speak
of
1
finger
head
fairly
persistent
slight
lacing
smell
used
to
smell
great
and
skunky
like
some
good
dank
marijuana
now
it
smells
like
bud
light
nonsense
same
witrh
the
taste
like
pisswater
now
i
am
reviewing
what
i
used
to
like
with
those
numbers
not
the
case
i
recently
drank
yes
congrats
inbev
youve
ruined
another
brand
next
im
craving
a
good
euro
lager
ill
make
a
better
choice
even
many
american
euro
style
lagers
are
insanely
better
prima
pils
from
victory
comes
to
mind
becks
25
tldr
ab
inbev
sucks
and
im
an
idiot
for
buying
this
flavor
toasted
white
bread
malt
sweetness
a
lingering
hop
bitterness
ill
never
forget
when
i
went
camping
we
had
crates
of
bud
and
becks
id
alternate
between
the
two
and
becks
blew
bud
away
every
time
be
warned
stay
away
from
this
stuff
as
well
as
the
becks
dark
i
see
that
many
of
the
chain
stores
have
it
on
sale
for
a
while
now
and
its
not
moving
well
i
have
to
agree
with
the
majority
this
beer
really
lost
something
in
the
transfer
from
germany
to
stl
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
in
the
late
80s
the
beer
was
robust
and
well
worth
the
price
at
that
time
the
flavor
just
was
outstanding
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
germany
just
by
drinking
it
im
trying
to
be
nice
here
the
color
is
great
it
pours
okay
but
then
i
have
to
drink
it
and
i
say
to
myself
what
happened
i
hope
inbev
will
address
this
situation
but
i
understand
its
all
about
money
to
some
people
overalldrinkability
like
many
german
lagers
engineered
to
be
drank
in
large
quantities
and
this
fits
that
quality
i
could
drink
more
but
i
know
there
are
more
flavorful
german
lagers
out
there
therefore
this
beer
is
at
best
average
pours
from
the
bottle
like
any
common
lager
with
a
sunny
yellow
color
with
maybe
a
hint
of
green
and
a
white
fizzy
head
the
aroma
is
a
combination
of
musty
hops
a
little
bit
of
lemon
and
some
light
crackerlike
breadiness
the
flavor
features
sweet
cereal
grains
a
bit
of
corn
and
only
a
faint
earthy
hop
character
there
is
also
a
little
bit
of
a
metallic
flavor
in
the
finish
which
always
tends
to
turn
me
off
there
is
some
body
but
the
light
fizzy
carbonation
cuts
right
through
it
overall
this
beer
is
fine
and
drinkable
but
not
appreciably
different
than
most
other
common
massproduced
lagers
o
well
it
lived
up
to
my
expectations
no
more
no
less
next
smells
skunky
but
isnt
overwhelming
theres
no
noticeable
hop
aroma
or
flavor
either
this
is
all
malt
not
even
good
malt
there
is
no
way
that
this
qualifies
as
a
pilsener
its
kind
of
pricy
cor
what
you
get
it
tastes
like
a
generic
cheap
euro
lager
sure
enoughon
the
front
label
instead
of
brewed
in
bremen
brewed
in
st
louis
fuck
another
of
lifes
simple
pleasures
killed
by
the
bean
counters
as
lagers
go
this
is
a
very
good
choice
pours
with
a
clear
golden
color
and
is
topped
with
a
medium
foamy
head
aroma
is
malty
where
grains
are
dominant
the
taste
is
therefore
initially
slightly
sweet
followed
by
a
pleasant
bitterwsweet
body
finishing
with
a
slight
bitterness
similar
to
other
lagers
but
there
is
more
taste
present
here
refreshing
and
tasty
its
becks
o
straight
forward
pale
lager
that
i
wouldnt
pay
more
than
20
for
a
case
inbev
really
messed
up
the
greatest
beer
on
my
planet
german
purity
law
scrapped
now
tastes
like
a
shot
of
water
has
been
added
to
every
bottle
yuck
trying
to
locate
the
oktoberfest
version
missing
in
action
wth
are
they
thinking
gosh
sakes
add
a
dollar
to
the
price
of
a
12
pack
and
go
back
to
the
great
brew
it
once
was
i
had
that
sick
feeling
inside
when
informed
of
inbev
desires
to
brew
it
in
a
bud
plant
gave
it
my
best
try
and
couldnt
believe
they
would
alter
it
very
foolish
move
as
for
now
my
only
redemption
is
saranac
oktoberfest
and
the
hunt
for
a
new
regular
beer
can
you
say
spaten
i
can
by
the
way
i
and
my
friends
think
the
art
work
on
the
bottles
is
idiotic
really
bad
cant
make
up
for
the
watering
down
nope
becks
is
on
of
thoses
beers
you
have
to
appreciate
the
second
time
around
when
i
first
had
it
i
didnt
like
it
at
all
second
time
around
i
tasted
the
stoutlike
finish
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
it
was
somehow
more
smooth
im
not
saying
to
anyone
who
reads
this
to
go
out
and
buy
becks
but
im
saying
that
i
like
it
it
has
character
if
its
your
style
then
good
but
i
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
and
it
actually
cause
my
stomach
to
get
upset
i
got
a
free
carton
of
becks
from
one
of
my
sales
reps
at
work
as
he
reps
for
a
german
company
i
so
wish
he
knew
of
my
penchant
from
weihenstephaner
aaaanywayslong
story
short
i
purchased
and
consumed
many
other
beers
before
i
finally
finished
this
case
in
a
fit
of
desperation
this
is
by
all
accounts
a
macro
beer
it
is
lacking
in
taste
and
hardly
drinkable
smells
orrible
looks
clear
lightyellow
and
feels
underwhelming
i
avoid
this
beer
as
its
very
hard
to
drink
i
respect
this
beer
for
its
worldwide
appeal
its
high
international
sales
and
its
country
of
origin
thats
about
it
overall
a
good
refreshing
beer
but
fails
to
stand
out
bas
wont
be
impressed
but
its
not
bad
and
highly
accessible
quaffable
but
so
many
better
if
slightly
harder
to
find
options
chilled
and
poured
out
of
the
bottle
into
a
nice
clean
glass
where
is
the
hop
aroma
and
bite
really
weak
and
watered
down
i
know
the
becks
of
old
had
it
plenty
of
times
shame
they
did
this
to
a
beer
with
the
reputation
that
becks
had
to
the
point
just
another
tasteless
pilsner
right
in
there
with
corona
land
shark
and
the
like
i
dont
remember
the
last
time
i
had
a
becks
but
it
did
not
taste
like
this
could
actually
use
a
bit
stronger
pilsner
taste
i
would
recommend
having
this
on
tap
or
something
instead
of
a
possibly
skunked
green
bottle
not
a
bad
beer
until
it
was
produced
domestically
save
yourself
some
money
and
order
a
bud
same
stuff
anyway
the
becks
black
is
even
more
disappointing
they
added
more
alcohol
but
its
the
same
crummy
fake
import
for
a
few
dollars
more
go
for
a
heineken
thanks
i
drank
this
beer
last
night
at
the
uc
in
chicago
out
of
a
16
oz
can
when
i
saw
the
label
brewed
in
the
usa
i
knew
i
had
the
imposter
in
hand
everyone
i
implore
you
do
not
buy
inbev
products
if
you
can
help
it
certainly
dont
buy
becks
usa
do
not
support
their
program
to
buy
breweries
cheapen
recipes
and
ruin
what
was
otherwise
good
beer
inbev
are
a
plague
on
this
earth
becks
is
their
latest
outrage
to
the
beer
drinker
boycott
this
beer
unfortunately
domestic
american
beers
are
a
joke
i
completely
gave
up
on
them
of
the
foreign
beers
becks
has
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
it
has
a
very
classic
skunky
european
smell
to
it
its
nod
bad
just
a
very
distinctive
odor
it
goes
well
with
food
or
by
itself
after
a
long
day
it
can
be
found
in
most
stores
in
my
area
and
has
a
very
affordable
price
at
3
49
for
a
24
oz
bottle
i
am
surprised
to
see
other
comments
bashing
this
beer
i
suppose
its
a
case
of
love
it
or
hate
it
overall
4
25
certainly
an
easy
drinking
pils
i
think
the
us
version
is
brewed
in
st
louis
go
figure
but
not
bad
this
is
a
generic
german
pilsener
if
you
do
not
like
pilsener
you
will
hate
becks
very
strong
flavor
quite
bitter
actually
tastes
best
a
little
warmer
than
most
beer
5060
degrees
which
allows
the
true
bitterness
to
be
revealed
refreshing
taste
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
better
than
others
ive
had
in
the
style
but
not
by
much
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
good
for
such
a
light
beer
a
good
change
of
pace
in
a
lighter
drinking
beer
the
appearance
was
a
beautiful
shade
of
gold
but
it
poured
a
thin
head
and
had
little
to
know
lacing
the
smell
was
a
good
strong
odor
of
malt
and
barley
appealing
but
not
over
powering
mouthfeel
had
strong
carbonation
with
good
velvety
and
smooth
roll
on
the
tongue
i
liked
the
taste
it
was
bold
crisp
and
better
than
what
i
had
expected
not
the
best
beer
ive
had
but
good
enough
always
a
hint
of
skunkiness
to
this
beer
and
just
a
little
too
rough
if
you
can
get
past
a
couple
of
these
its
not
a
problem
otherwise
a
nice
color
kind
of
crisp
effervescent
kevin
bacon
drank
one
in
shes
having
a
baby
and
the
beer
still
retains
a
1980s

in

third
best
beer
in
germany
riiight
becks
is
probably
german
for
run
of
the
mill
not
terrible
for
a
macro
it
produced
a
nice
white
head
with
average
head
retention
average
lacing
the
aroma
consisted
of
light
grain
you
can
get
much
better
beers
and
good
lord
odto
summarize
i
would
probably
pick
this
before
a
bunch
of
other
macro
brews
that
is
all
overall
what
we
enjoyed
most
about
this
brew
was
how
mild
the
flavoring
was
had
they
attempted
to
amp
up
any
aspects
of
this
beers
flavor
profile
it
could
have
resulted
in
a
much
more
offensive
and
bitter
beer
while
it
falls
generally
within
the
parameters
for
the
style
everything
is
muted
and
the
beer
is
not
really
the
most
exciting
thing
to
drink
o
i
had
this
a
few
months
ago
out
of
the
can
and
was
disappointed
maybe
cuz
i
was
already
intoxicated
this
beer
actually
surprised

a
16oz
can
its
somewhat
of
a
bargain
overall
a
step
up
from
the
countless
other
eurobeers
that
are
on
the
market
but
its
still
nothing
to
write
home
about
there
are
some
other
beers
in
this
stylecategory
that
id
drink
before
this
one
its
extremely
basic
but
in
all
fairness
becks
subscribes
to
the
reinheitsgebot
or
the
german
beer
purity
law
a
now
defunct
regulation
originating
in
15th
century
germany
that
prohibited
beer
from
being
made
with
anything
other
than
water
barley
and
hops
its
more
or
less
just
a
marketing
ploy
now
but
if
thats
how
you
earned
your
success
why
change
it
its
hard
to
find
a
lot
of
complexity
in
beer
that
is
literally
water
malt
and
hops
but
it
makes
for
a
good
baseline
to
compare
other
beers
to
its
good
if
thats
what
youre
in
the
mood
for
but
relatively
basic
otherwise
this
was
a
very
pleasant
surprise
i
was
expecting
to
be
handing
a
d
on
this
review
and
im
pleased
to
say
it
was
better
than
i
had
remembered
drinkable
but
not
a
brilliant
lager
compared
to
some
flavour
too
light
and
bland
with
insufficient
hop
presence
to
add
character
this
is
cheaply
available
and
ok
on
a
hot
day
but
nothing
special
i
actually
found
this
beer
to
be
more
enjoyable
than
i
though
i
would
not
as
good
as
bitburger
but
thats
fine
since
we
dont
have
that
in
socorro
anyway
wouldnt
buy
a
sixer
of
this
but
another
24oz
bottle
for
2
60
if
the
german
pils
craving
hits
may
not
be
out
of
the
question
mo
a
light
watery
sticky
beer
that
is
rather
forgetful
awhile
back
a
friend
of
mine
who
told
me
about
beer
advocate
told
me
becks
was
pretty
much
another
budweiser
but
even
though
budweiser
is
nothing
great
ill
take
that
or
rolling
rock
over
becks
any
day
this
is
a
german
pilsener
brewed
in
germany
these
guys
really
need
to
step
up
their
game
taste
profile
is
perfect
for
those
who
dont
really
like
beer
upfront
sweetness
very
little
malt
or
hopsthen
no
aftertaste
a
sodapop
beer
thats
forgettable
as
soon
as
its
done
overall
eh
no
thanks
drinkability
overall
this
beer
is
highy
drinkable
to
me
as
they
come
its
got
such
a
nice
hop
finish
and
for
such
and
affordable
beer
and
easily
available
this
is
way
towards
the
top
for
me
its
above
both
stella
and
above
heineken
overall
for
me
in
the
european
easy
to
find
everywhere
lager
style
its
got
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
interesting
and
still
has
those
perfect
characteristics
your
looking
for
on
a
hot
summer
day
to
me
and
underrated
beer
especially
when
compared
to
its
peers
o
theres
nothing
special
with
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
say
no
if
i
was
offered
this
beer
its
an
easy
drinking
session
beer
overall
i
dont
hate
it
if
this
was
all
i
could
get
my
hands
as
well
as
the
usual
bmc
id
happily
take
it
but
there
are
better
options
usually
available
to
me
that
said
its
not
bad
and
right
now
my
favorite
of
the
bland
lagers
in
terms
of
philippine
beers
its
much
closer
to
and
is
even
slightly
better
than
san
miguel
super
dry
the
regular
san
miguel
pale
pilsen
doesnt
compare
i
enjoyed
this
brew
eh
not
fairly
impressed
o
overall
a
crisp
and
refreshing
pilsener
that
is
easily
drinkable
and
boasts
decent
flavours
for
a
mass
produced
ale
one
of
the
better
macro
pils
imo
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
pours
a
palegolden
body
with
a
small
1
finger
head
and
minimal
retention
smells
pretty
much
like
a
german
pilsener
not
too
much
distinctive
here
tastes
slightly
biscuity
with
a
pleasant
fruity
finish
which
leaves
a
slightly
dry
feel
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
not
the
best
but
not
the
worst
german
pilsener
if
given
the
choice
go
with
spaten
becks
was
probably
one
of
the
first
german
beers
i
had
ever
tried
and
it
really
didnt
raise
the
bar
too
high
i
couldnt
get
over
how
skunky
this
beer
smelled
the
taste
kind
of
reflects
that
too
grassy
funky
flavors
on
the
tongue
which
didnt
really
make
me
enjoy
this
beer
at
all
c
d
it
is
surprisingly
drinkable
and
enjoyable
to
a
certain
degree
a
high
selling
beer
in
europe
and
possibly
one
of
the
best
among
that
category
still
not
good
im
glad
i
didnt
pay
for
this
one
poured
a
3
white
head
which
dissipated
to
nothing
clear
straw
yellow
color
smells
of
a
basic
lager
with
the
slightest
hint
of
start
of
skunking
taste
is
corn
and
a
mild
sweetness
theres
a
slight
zing
all
in
all
pretty
boring
and
in
a
blind
taste
testing
id
have
guessed
it
was
some
adjunct
american
lager
pours
an
odd
off
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
that
goes
away
quickly
and
has
no
lacing
smells
well
skunked
just
terrible
like
a
rotting
corpse
or
something
dead
tastes
better
like
corn
adjuncts
some
sweet
malts
and
a
faint
inkling
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
with
a
thick
carbonation
drinkability
is
not
very
good
this
is
not
a
real
lager
d
if
people
want
to
supply
their
parties
with
it
ill
drink
it
as
far
as
buying
it
im
just
not
that
into
pilsner
that
i
would
want
to
get
such
a
run
of
the
mill
basic
one
not
my
fave
but
makes
me
appreciate
a
great
craft
beer
even
more
very
standard
stuff
here
id
be
lying
if
i
said
it
wasnt
intensely
drinkable
maybe
i
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
it
since
it
was
one
of
my
very
first
nonusa
macros
but
i
do
enjoy
it
this
beer
is
much
better
in
a
can
than
it
is
bottled
i
once
had
a
german
friend
who
offered
this
beer
to
me
and
i
wasnt
impressed
granted
it
does
taste
better
to
the
good
ol
american
bud
light
becks
has
an
awful
smell
to
it
but
if
you
can
get
beyond
the
smell
it
does
taste
ok
had
this
on
tap
at
a
bar
without
any
good
choices
pours
a
pale
yellow
colour
with
very
thin
white
head
almost
no
lacing
and
head
dissipates
to
nothing
pretty
quickly
smells
of
some
grains
i
dont
detect
even
a
hint
of
hops
small
bitterness
in
the
flavour
fairly
sweet
mouthfeel
actually
is
nice
for
the
style
which
seems
to
be
about
the
only
thing
i
liked
with
this
beer
btw
theyve
updated
the
label
from
the
photo
here
its
basically
a
large
becks
logo
across
the
middle
more
pronounced
for
the
better
probably
im
sure
people
are
donating
the
bottles
in
the
photo
to
their
local
thrift
stores
or
will
someday
and
theyll
mark
them
as
collectable
like
my
local
hazel
dell
salvation
army
would
and
then
sell
them
for
12
d
well
after
the
skunk
fades
this
is
certainly
drinkable
is
it
a
german
pils
to
style
i
think
id
pick
it
over
eku
pils
in
a
blind
test
pretty
quickly
the
citrus
character
and
grainy
flavor
seem
to
put
this
beer
in
its
own
category
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
id
choose
it
over
bmc
any
day
but
definitely
not
over
a
good
munich
helles
sure
wish
id
found
one
of
those
d
blah
bitter
and
skunky
nasty
as
others
say
before
me
d
i
will
never
purchase
this
beer
again
it
is
your
typical
watery
mass
produced
pilsner
while
tasting
a
little
better
than
most
it
is
still
isnt
very
good
the
only
plus
side
is
its
easy
to
drink
that
is
if
you
can
ignore
the
lack
of
taste
serving
type
tap
d
a
fairly
pricey
option
for
a
thin
uninteresting
brew
drinkable
but
so
is
tea
d
blah
bitter
and
skunky
nasty
pale
fizzy
watery
yellow
first
thing
i
smell
two
feet
off
is
an
oniony
skunk
dont
you
love
sub
tropical
island
that
could
care
less
if
your
beer
has
sat
out
in
the
sun
for
years
anyhow
it
turns
out
its
not
so
skunky
sharp
pils
bite
that
quickly
subsides
into
wonderful
malt
then
after
its
gone
down
the
sticky
residue
brind
back
on
more
hops
and
says
hay
lets
have
another
drink
shall
we
mouthfeel
lets
be
honest
its
just
good
to
have
a
brew
in
my
mouth
its
cold
and
almost
harsh
bite
to
it
the
carbonation
is
that
of
warm
soda
but
quickly
smooths
out
notes
my
workhorse
pilsner
gonna
price
out
a
12
keg
this
week
started
drinking
this
one
out
of
the
bottle
but
decided
to
put
the
majority
of
it
into
a
glass
it
had
the
typical
fast
dissolving
head
with
the
typical
gold
color
it
smelled
of
skunk
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
behind
it
the
taste
thankfully
only
has
a
slight
tinge
of
that
skunk
with
that
german
european
beer
taste
in
the
background
besides
the
skunk
it
had
a
grainy
malt
taste
but
with
a
pretty
nice
hop
character
that
reminds
of
me
of
a
subtle
version
of
victorys
prima
pils
its
a
very
floral
bitter
hop
note
that
reminds
me
of
the
hops
in
a
boston
lager
it
has
some
creamy
mouthfeel
which
is
definitely
a
plus
seriously
if
they
just
put
this
in
brown
bottles
itd
be
quite
enjoyable
other
than
that
theres
other
german
beers
you
can
get
for
almost
the
same
price
that
are
better
in
my
opinion
d
euro
lager
pretty
plain
and
not
that
enjoyable
sorry
germany
this
is
not
a
good
pilsner
its
more
like
a
typical
eurolager
think
heineken
but
with
more
steel
and
aluminum
it
is
brewed
by
the
german
purity
law
says
so
on
the
bottle
and
websight
its
a
decent
tasting
beer
for
a
macro
and
i
dont
understand
why
it
gets
a
bashing
its
a
great
pounder
in
the
summer
over
the
bmc
junk
becks
really
reminded
me
of
a
slightly
watereddown
heineken
actually
its
more
focused
on
hops
than
malts
but
its
not
overpowering
i
liked
it
way
more
than
i
thought
i
would
overall
it
was
similar
to
heineken
but
smoother
and
less
skunky
im
sure
ill
be
drinking
it
again
for
a
german
macro
i
was
surprised
at
how
decent
it
was
i
thought
it
would
be
lacking
in
flavor
but
use
the
german
name
as
a
crutch
for
sales
but
i
wouldnt
hesitate
to
order
one
again
if
you
like
smoother
crisp
hoppier
beers
this
is
one
to
try
for
sure
pours

with
a
small
short

bready

balanced

light
crisp

average
earthy
finish
its
been
a
long

since
i
drank
this
beer
and
i
didnt
expect
much
however
this
helles
is
better
than
most
i
tried
clean
pleasant
after
taste
buy
it
from
a
can
then
decide
if
you
like
it
of
not
this
pale
pilsner
produced
a
weak
one
finger
head
of
light
white
foam
it
quickly
vanished
leaving
nothing
but
a
ring
of
wisp
around
the
edge
of
the
glass
pale
yellow
color
matches
a
4
on
the
srm
beer
color
chart
this
beer
has
the
aroma
of
caramelized
wheat
barley
malt
and
green
hops
tastes
are
wisps
of
lime
golden
wheat
and
heavy
hops
sort
of
watery
across
my
tongue
and
against
my
upper
palate
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
better
flavor
but
i
dont
think
i
will
have
another
unless
it
is
offered
d
overcarbonated
and
underflavored
next
please
d
if
heineken
is
your
beer
then
this
would
be
perfect
for
you
otherwise
a
very
simple
pilsener
with
nothing
complex
going
on
pours
a
somewhatdeep
straw
color
with
a
multifinger
white
head
that
leaves
behind
the
tiniest
bit
of
lacing
smell
brings
some
very
light
herbal
floral
hops
and
some
grain
taste
is
slightly
bitter
and
mostly
consists
of
a
plain
grain
and
husk
flavor
large
amounts
of

drinks
okay
and
better
than

bad
either
the
flavor
and

arent
offensive
as
you
find
with
most
american
macro
lagers
the
flavor
is
farily
crisp
and
not
dominated
by
adjunct
which
is
sad
that
not
dominated
by
corn
is
a
plus

it
was
something
that
i
had
not
tried
before
i
figure
i
would
try
it
since
it
was
german
beer
i
was
not

crazy
about
it
the

it

skunked

i
had
it
in

golden

i
didnt
like
it
that
much
and
wouldnt
plan
on
buying
it
again
for
a
german
beer
i
would
think
it
would
better
the
taste
is
quite
similar
to
the
smell
big
grains
corn
and
other
flavors
lightly
sweetened
and
somewhat
skunky
the
finish
is
smooth
though
making
it
palatable
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
flat
and
thin
but
this
beer
is
certainly
drinkable
i
usually
try
and
drink
it
still
in
the
bottle
at
a
crowded
bar
where
im
not
as
concerned
about
flavor
putting
it
into
a
mug
and
enjoying
it
at
home
as
i
did
the
other
night
isnt
really
recommended
ive
sampled
becks
many
times
both
from
can
and
bottle
and
have
never
really
been
impressed
while
i
dont
consider
it
the
worst
offender
in
terms
of
massproduced
beers
i
can
still
find
no
way
of
understanding
how
this
has
become
germanys
number
one
selling
beer
it
certainly
wouldnt
be
my
first
choice
if
i
were
living
over
there
pours
out
to
a
decent
yellow
with
a
twofinger
head
that
subsides
gradually
the
smell
is
quite
thin
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
alright
but
nothing
special
you
can
taste
a
bit
of
the
hops
though
its
rather
faint
the
mouthfeel
is
rather
thin
but
the
head
makes
it
more
interesting
than
the
average
macro
in
all
a
decently
drinkable
beer
quite
nice
when
its
cold
d
highly
drinkable
the
smell
wasnt
too
great
but
the
taste
was
fine
although
nothing
to
write
home
about
dry
aftertaste
not
overpowering
overall
a
fine
beer
drinkability
is
good
d
pretty
good
but
the
dryness
and
lack
of
visual
flare
are
strikes
against
it
overall
not
the
most
remarkable
pils
out
there
but
a
solid
example
of
the
style
and
mild
enough
to
act
as
a
crossover
beer
i
can
easily
see
myself
drinking
a
lot
of
these
if
nothing
better
were
available
worth
a
try
prost
in
my
opinion
becks
is
one
of
the
best
and
most
reasonably
priced
macrolagers
available
extremely
drinkable
and
tasty
my
friends
and
i
will
drink
this
anytime
over
the
heinekens
amstels
and
buds
of
the
world
when
quantity
is
valued
over
quality
i
dont
believe
youre
sacrificing
too
much
with
becks
it
pours
a
pale
honey
light
coloration
with
a
light
crisp
head
a
bit
skunky
but
better
than
many
lagers
it
starts
with
a
light
sweetness
but
finishes
with
a
strong
dry
hoppy
taste
excellent
balanced
and
smooth
mouthfeel
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
in
quantity
as
well
as
one
with
a
nice
meal
d
poured
into
the
glass
its
a
much
better
beer
against
the
other
macros
i
would
definitely
choose
this
but
the
grainy
dry
hoppy
sicklyness
in
the
taste
would
not
turn
this
into
a
session
beer
for
me
not
bad
drinkability
yep
its
good
a
pale
yellow
pour
with
not
much
head
not
much
retention
and
not
much
worth
commenting
on
smells
of
grassy
grains
but
not
well
done
like
others
in
its
genre
the
taste
begins
as
sweet
and
tapers
into
a
mild
waterbased
flavor
mouthfeel
follows
suit
with
mediocrity
you
can
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
if
you
want
but
it
depends
on
if
you
want
to
drink
beer
as
opposed
to
enjoy
it
out
of
a
nitro
tap
this
beer
is
a
whole
different
animal
opposed
to
the
bitter
taste
out
fo
a
can
from
the
tap
it
has
more
fo
a
honey
wheat
taste
to
it
almost
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
decent
head
doesnt
smell
like
much
of
anything
and
tastes
a
little
watered
down
but
still
pretty
good
not
too
bad
compared
to
other
german
imports
party
beer
with
class
it
says
im
too
cool
for
heineken
but
not
above
having
a
terrible
hangover
tomorrow
becks
was
light
golden
in
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
was
medium
in
size
but
was
soon
reduced
to
a
very
thin
spotty
layer
with
very
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
light
malt
and
some
floral
hops
the
taste
was
crisp
with
a
little
sweet
malt
and
a
funky
hop
flavor
the
finish
was
dry
with
a
slight
metallic
twang
the
body
was
mediumlight
with
plenty
of
carbonation
its
drinkable
but
not
the
best
pilsner
out
there
by
a
longshot
poured
from
its
16oz
can
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
color
with
a
small
fizzy
head
that
quickly
dissapears
into
a
sporadic
lacing
aroma
is
clean
with
a
lot
of
sweet
grain
taste
is
more
grain
with
a
slightly
spicey
hop
finish
overall
this
is
a
decent
german
pils
that
is
pretty
drinkable

pours
a
golden
color
very
clear
perhaps
just
a
shade
darker
than
the
usual
macros
lots
of
streaming
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
nice
fluffy
white
head
holds
together
better
than
most
macros
slightly
skunky
floral
and
earthy
aromas
pale
malt
flavor
combines
with
adjunct
sweetness
earthy
and
musty
flavors
follow
as
well
there
is
enough
bitterness
not
crisp
and
clean
and
snappy
like
a
good
pilsner
light
body
but
no
too
terribly
fizzy
there
is
more
flavor
here
so
maybve
a
small
step
above
most
macros
get
my
buzz
on
n
salud
taste
is
thin
and
watery
pretty
sweet
a
bit
of
nuttiness
and
a
soapy
metallic
acidity
thats
probably
hops
really
really
thin
and
boring
body
is
weak
and
lifeless
with
a
dry
finish
this
ones
tough
to
have
more
than
one
at
a
time
not
recommended
if
you
like
flavour
in
your
beer
my
first
and
thus
a
favorite
of
sorts
but
as
much
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
it
just
isnt
the
best
far
from
it
becks
has
an
odd
yellow
sometimes
green
tinted
color
in
the
glass
and
a
minimal
head
nose
is
all
hops
almost
to
skunk
in
the
bottle
taste
is
also
very
spicy
hops
but
with
a
fruity
flavor
that
mellows
slightly
over
time
malt
is
present
in
taste
especially
as
beer
bubbles
in
glass
for
awhile
but
never
overpowers
the
hops
flavor
apparently
the
beer
was
highly
hopped
so
it
could
be
imported
to
the
us
way
back
when
thats
a
distinctive
taste
the
bottle
is
attractive
the
photo
above
does
not
reflect
the
current
labeling
and
the
name
is
synonymous
with
german
purity
law
brewing
its
a
classic
a
macro
import
and
deserves
is
popularity
but
there
are
better
germans
out
there
even
better
becks
see
gold
and
oktoberfest
if
you
can
get
it
on
tap
its
much
better
less
skunk
this
is
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
a
nice
white
foamy
head
the
color
is
light
straw
with
good
carbonation
the
smell
is
faint
pale
malt
and
spicy
hop
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
but
very
thin
body
the
nice
bitterness
in
the
brew
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
this
macro
a
decent
choice
is
a
big
club
in
australia
becks
is
brewed
locally
under
license
and
is
generally
quite
approachable
this
bottle
originated
in
bremen
and
had
lost
a
lot
in
transit
in
the
mouth
it
is
ligt
on
the
palate
and
is
highly
carbonated
a
little
too
much
in
my
opinion
carbonation
takes
away
from
the
flavor
of
the
beer
feels
like
sprite
or
tonic
water
on
the
palate
but
easy
to
drink
and
kinda
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
day
after
work
prolly
wont
buy
it
again
because
i
know
that
there
are
much
better
german
pils
on
the
market
however
i
think
it
can
and
is
a
good
crossover
beer
smell
is
a
bit
dodgy
but
the
taste
i
would
describe
as
a
rising
bitterness
not
sure
how
to
translate
that
into
brewspeak
compared
to
other
eurolagers
such
as
grolsch
or
carlsberg
it
definitely
has
more
flavour
is
quite
a
harsh
one
however
i
can
see
where
other
reviewers
get
metallic
from
in
my
view
this
counts
as
a
postive
plus
for
uniqueness
as
the
mean
taste
of
becks
does
stand
it
slightly
apart
drinkability
is
where
it
gets
its
shoes
knocked
off
after
about
two
youre
just
sick
of
the
immediate
aftertaste
almost
to
the
point
of
yacking
sometimes
still
an
interesting
product
nonetheless
im
generally
not
impressed
by
this
beer
i
would
expect
a
german
pilsener
to
have
atleast
some
malt
aspects
instead
of
just
hops
below
average
at
best
after
several
tastes
i
can
see
why
becks
can
be
a
bit
disappointing
other
german
macros
have
produced
better
renditions
of
this
mass
produced
style

this

its

of
the
beers
that
first
got

beer

digging

have

beer

times

add

point
becks
really
is

appealing
in

dripping

the
flavor
is
also
rather
tame
it
has
a
drinkable
quality
although
it
is
heavier
than
the
mainstream
american
lagers
it
has
a
malt
emphasis
although
there
is
little
distinctiveness
in
the
brew
this
beer
has
very
minimal
hop
presence
my
limit
is
two
overall
this
beer
has
almost
no
taste
to
it
the
malty
taste
is
ok
though
so
i
could
see
many
people
sucking
these
down
cuz
i
could
finish
this
in
5
minutes

as
a

very

mildly
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
very
light
bodied
with
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
slightly
rough
as
it

drinkability
is
a
stronger
point
of
this
beer
as
i
find
it
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
with
an
occasionally
appreciable
light
quality
about
it
without
the
typical
taste
of
a
light
macro
beer
would
probably
purchase
again
nice
for

day
in
the
yard
taste
was
malty
sweet
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
mostly
watery
and
boring
i
could
taste
a
very
slight
skunkiness
but
it
wasnt
too
bad
this
beer
was
very
light
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
thus
pretty
easy
to
guzzle
for
this
reason
im
giving
it
an
average
drinkability
in
my
opinion
this
beer
has
a
little
more
character
than
us
macros
but
its
not
as
tasty
as
heineken
this
is
a
drinkable
beer
its
not
real
robust
in
terms
of
flavor
but
i
think
its
a
fair
representation
of
the
pilsner
style
i
would
probably
have
becks
pilsner
again
especially
since
there
are
not
a
lot
of
pilsners
to
choose
from
in
my
local
market
pretty
good
beer
at
least
by
us
macro
standards
there
are
far
better
german
beers
but
this
is
worth
a
try
at
least
once
its
best
quality
is
its
drinkability
its
a
highly
quaffable
brew
overall
i
must
admit
that
given
the
high
level
of
advertisement
for
this
beer
i
was
prepared
to
not
like
it
however
i
find
that
it
appeals
to
me
in
summary
it
is
quite
clean
with
a
nice
overall
crispness
drinkability
i
imagine
that
fans
of
the
pilsner
would
enjoy
a
beer
like
this
but
it
would
certainly
wear
on
me
because
of
the
unfamiliar
taste
and
the
lingering
bitterness
at
the
end
not
worth
the
price
of
the
import
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
descent
white
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
long
the
aroma
is
mostly
biscuity
malt
and
grain
husks
with
some
slight
herbal
and
spicy
bitterness
the
flavor
is
again
mostly
malty
with
notes
of
biscuit
and
grain
husk
as
well
as
some
mild
spicy
and
herbal
hops
simple
and
basic
but
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
sprightly
with
high
carbonation
and
drinkability
is
excellent
a
descent
lawn
mower
beer
very
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
this
can
produced
very
near
draft
taste
it
was
fresh
bright
with
nobel
hops
and
the
beck
special
pale
malt
decoction
was
detectable
in
the
falvor
profile
a
light
hoppy
dry
german
pils
that
has
stood
the
test
of
time
drinkability
this
goes
down
easy
and
can
put
down
several
in
a
session
this
is
not
great
beer
by
any
means
but
its
not
bad
either
and
will
do
when
its
all
that
can
found
when
far
from
sources
of
great
craft
brews
and
certainly
ill
take
it
over
the
vast
majority
of
am
macro
brews
eurogreen
bottle
with
silver
foil
over
neck
and
cap
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
good
sized
white
head
smells
a
bit
hoppy
and
a
bit
skunky
maybe
some
malt
in
the
aroma
as
well
taste
has
some
hops
to
it
tastes
plain
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
nothing
unusual
just
straight
up
clean
taste
this
has
an
ok
mouthfeel
and
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
good
too
bad
it
is
priced
as
a
premium
import
mouthfeel
somewhat
creamy
which
was
unexpected
flavor
was
typical
of
this
henikenesque
variety
and
i
dont
hate
heiniken
not
something
id
session
but
i
could
drink
a
couple
with
a
steak
dinner
this
poured
from
the
can
to
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
weak
head
smell
is
clean
with
that
typical
german
lager
barley
malt
smell
which
is
really
not
bad
taste
is
rather
watery
very
little
body
not
really
bad
but
not
really
good
either
it
however
bears
that
virtue
of
being
easy
to
drink
a
good
choice
if
youre
given
a
choice
between
this
and
the
king
of
beers
but
with
so
many
better
offerings
out
there
i
wouldnt
strongly
recommend
this
one
i
dont
know
if
im
not
only
one
who
notices
it
or
if
theres
something
wrong
with
me
but
every
time
i
have
a
becks
all
i
can
taste
and
smell
is
honey
i
initially
thought
i
had
a
weird
batch
but
it
happens
every
time
its
not
totally
gross
but
its
strange
aside
from
that
becks
tastes
like
any
other
macro
lager
certainly
not
too
bad
and
even
kind
of
interesting
and
different
but
not
at
all
worth
the
price
poor
flavor
most
of
the
flavor
was
the
skunk
as
i
think
there
is
no
real
malt
or
hops
flavor
in
this
beer
i
plan
to
forget
this
beer
and
never
look
back
unsalted
saltine
crackers
soaked
in
hopflavored
seltzer
that
pretty
much
sums
up
this
brew
for
me
seltzer
crackers
some
hops
bitterness
guzzleable
nothing
to
really
sing
about
not
offensive
but
this
just
barely
qualifies
as
beer
no
wonder
its
probably
the
best
selling
german
beer
in
the
us
i
wonder
how
many
germans
actually
drink
this
stuff
light
pale
yellow
with
a
big
white
head
that
diminishes
quickly
to
almost
nothing
mild
malt
smell
crackers
white
bread
with
a
hint
of
hops
and
that
cheap
pilsener
skunkiness
pretty
bland
taste
is
lightly
malty
light
hops
bitterness
mostly
just
fizzy
fizziness
with
a
note
of
skunk
mouthfeel
is
fizzy
skunk
very
drinkable
but
then
who
would
want
to
a
huge
step
down
from
the
big
american
non
light
macros
and
that
is
pretty
sad
becuase
of
course
those
suck
for
the
most
part
not
a
beer
i
would
pick
up
for
sole
consumption
perhaps
with
a
salty
and
greasy
meal
this
beer
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
decent
sized
head
from
a
one
pint
can
that
dissipated
quickly
smell
is
kind
of
grainy
the
taste
manages
to
retain
its
skunkiness
even
though
i
purchased
a
can
to
avoid
it
being
light
struck
from
those
green
bottles
becks
favor
there
is
a
metallic
taste
that
seems
to
go
away
after
the
first
couple
of
sips
fairly
drinkable
euro
lager
perhaps
a
step
up
from
american
macros
but
not
much
taste
starts
off
smooth
on
the
tongue
but
at
the
end
nice
bitterness
on
the
back
of
the
throat
very
little
carbonation
nice
head
a
great
beer
i
think
this
would
taste
even
more
refreshing
with
a
slice
of
lime
on
a
hot
summers
night
taste
goodcarbonated
very
drinkable
but
nothing
special
clear
just
a
few
hop
feeels
in
it
but
in
the
aftertaste
theres
more
which
makes
it
bitter
d
sure
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
it
wouldnt
want
to
really
this
is
perhaps
the
least
reaction
ive
had
to
any
beer
in
a
long
time
im
not
really
offended
or
anything
just
so
blah
about
it
salud
taste
is
the
slightest
bit
intriguing
have
never
been
a
huge
fan
of
becks
but
this
drop
is
okay
its
slightly
european
in
that
there
is
a
fruity
hint
on
the
front
palatte
but
subtly
so
in
this
case
it
may
be
too
subtle
as
the
palatte
quickly
descends
into
a
standard
lagery
flavour
its
quite
good
however
nothing
to
write
your
mother
about
but
very
drinkable
like
its
a
nicely
even
blend
of
bitter
and
sweet
flavours
nothing
overwhelming
which
is
really
a
bad
thing
since
theres
nothing
distinctive
about
it
but
certainly
drinkable
id
recommend
this
for
a
hardearned
thirst
long
before
id
recommend
victoria
bitter
for
example
but
then
i
wouldnt
feed
vb
to
my
worst
dog
who
was
already
dead
and
rotting
and
crawling
with
maggots
drinkability
can
and
have
drank
lots
of
these
never
my
first
or
second
choice
this
is
actually
decently
drinkable
yet
its
boring
and
would
really
only
do
the
job
if
you
were
really
thirsty
there
are
much
better
offerings
out
there
d
drinkable
last
year
i
really
liked
this
brew
but
now
its
hard
for
me
to
drink
as
well
as
alot
of
others
this
beer
was
part
of
a
german
beer
hall
tour
mixed
pack
i
received
for
christmas
a
best
before
date
of
08
2006
is
printed
on
the
reverse
label
followed
by
the
code
l
23559
b
conclusion
it
wasnt
very
interesting
but
it
wasnt
bad
at
all
certainly
a
good
lawnmower
type
beer
better
than
any
american
attempt
a
pilsner
that
ive
tried
yet
and
a
much
better
idea
than
heineken
if
you
want
to
look
sophisticated
by
drinking
an
import
but
only
know
one
or
two
names
all
the
same
for
the
price
id
say
czechvar
is
the
pils
to
buy
or
urquell
if
you
like
uneccessary
harshness
and
prefer
heineken
to
becks
i
think
stella
is
slightly
better
as
well
but
this
does
beat
every
american
pils
read
macro
lager
ive
had
if
served
this
for
free
id
be
very
happy
but
there
are
tons
of
better
and
often
cheaper
brews
you
can
usually
find
czechvar
was
is
the
superlative
beer
americas
budweiser
is
the
mutant
bastard
version
of
becks
about
splits
the
difference
what
budweiser
should
realistically
taste
like
considering
its
so
cheaply
made
and
made
for
such
a
wide
demographic
drinkability
could
drink
a
bunch
but
would
pick
a
diff
brew
when
at
the
store
overall
becks
is
an
ok
german
pilsner
becks
dark
is
much
better
becks
rocks
how
could
this
come
out
so
badly
on
the
reviews
it
is
what
it
is
a
german
pils
that
has
a
great
finish
the
head
on
it
is
poor
but
it
is
overall
a
great
classic
beer
a
good
beer
that
can
be
purchased
at
the
supermarket
anywhere
by
the
way
it
is
in
the
same
catagory
as
far
as
taste
goes
as
a
heineken
very
good
smooth
finish
no
subtle
tastes
though
if
you
havent
tried
it
it
is
a
great
example
of
a
classic
german
pils
a
major
dowfall
with
this
beer
is
cost
in
which
case
if
you
like
stronger
dark
beers
like
me
there
are
better
german
beers
out
there
for
the
same
price
yeah
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
but
in
racing
parlance
prefer
others
opinion
well
sadly
my
previous
opinion
of
this
beer
holds
true
it
really
isnt
that
great
of
a
beer
i
lived
in
germany
for
a
while
and
i
dont
remember
this
beer
being
that
popular
over
there
either
i
would
take
it
over
budmilloors
but
if
this
beer
was
skunked
too
i
would
probably
opt
for
the
water
instead
damn
im
such
a
snob
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
creamy
with
ample
carbonation
theres
actually
a
nice
body
to
this
compared
to
most
euro
lagers
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
really
doesnt
grab
my
attention
at
the
same
time
just
puts
me
through
the
motions
of
drinking
it
worth
it
if
theres
nothing
else
better
around
yeah
allinall
an
enjoyable
brew
a
solid
beer
but
nothing
magical
yeah
this
one
is
now
an
euro
macro
but
it
wasnt
some
hideous
monster
plain
lite
straw
colored
white
head
etc
etc
at
least
it
had
some
taste
lite
malt
lite
hop
and
the
euro
skunk
i
could
go
a
session
with
these
6
pack
at
a
picnic
except
id
rather
get
something
better
can
obtained
from
the
discount
bin
of
liquor
mart
boulder
pours
a
two
finger
rising
white
head
over
a
light
straw
colored
liquid
clear
but
not
crystal
clear
the
head
settles
to
a
sticky
film
that
hangs
over
the
beer
smells
light
and
fresh
malty
thats
helped
by
a
fresh
flroal
hop
smell
somewhat
piney
like
a
sand
dune
covered
with
evergreens
maybe
a
little
bit
of
dried
wood
in
there
too
okay
now
i
got
it
its
got
a
light
hint
of
mango
in
the
smell
tastes
red
fruity
sweet
with
mild
hop
floral
and
a
gentle
hop
bitter
rising
late
the
carbonation
is
too
strong
and
my
tongue
is
left
with
a
rising
sting
from
tiny
co2
bubbles
forming
on
my
tastebuds
swirl
to
release
some
carbonation
a
large
head
reforms
and
settles
to
a
sticky
mat
a
darker
hop
aroma
can
now
be
found
the
flavor
is
watery
now
with
a
dark
hop
ending
thats
not
so
pleasant
oh
well
often
releasing
carbonation
can
allow
intruiging
qualities
in
a
beer
to
come
out
not
this
time
note
to
self
dont
drink
flat
becks
body
is
actually
md
light
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
but
the
now
tinlike
hop
flavor
is
beginning
to
get
to
me
sorry
guys
this
one
just
cant
be
helped
stamp
on
the
bottom
of
the
can
is
05
2005
a
l1474
13
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
fluffy
white
head
little
bit
of
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
honeylike
some
hops
and
definite
skunk
taste
is
sweet
slight
hops
in
the
finish
some
skunk
once
again
mouthfeel
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
refreshing
but
watery
shitty
mass
produced
euro
lager
although
not
as
bad
as
some
this
isnt
great
but
its
often
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
at
local
bars
and
restaurants
ill
give
it
a
tentative
thumbs
up
at
least
among
macros
becks
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
it
tastes
a
little
bit
skunky
but
once
you
get
past
that
its
really
good
i
love
sipping
and
enjoying
this
beer
i
buy
this
every
once
in
a
while
sometimes
you
have
to
be
in
the
right
mood
for
becks
it
never
fails
to
satisfy
me
becks
pours
a
light
straw
colour
with
an
industrial
white
foam
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
in
a
minute
or
two
as
unimpressive
as
the
head
itself
is
becks
does
leave
a
nice
if
not
suprising
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
what
you
would
expect
from
any
macrolager
subtle
hints
of
malty
sweetness
and
virtually
no
hops
and
you
have
to
put
all
your
smelling
capacity
into
smelling
what
is
there
that
is
you
have
to
smell
really
really
hard
to
figure
out
whats
there
granted
im
doing
this
review
after
tasting
a
bottle
of
coopers
extra
strong
ale
but
even
if
i
last
tasted
iced
tea
i
think
that
i
would
review
becks
the
same
its
a
beer
for
the
masses
however
the
masses
that
drink
this
might
in
fact
be
the
more
demanding
members
of
the
masses
than
those
who
drink
carlton
in
australia
or
bud
in
the
us
becks
while
it
does
lack
some
elements
of
flavour
and
mouthfeel
does
provide
a
nice
refreshing
taste
is
this
due
in
part
to
the
german
purity
laws
i
dont
know
what
i
do
know
is
that
for
an
international
macrobrew
i
am
not
at
all
offended
by
becks
im
not
that
impressed
but
im
certainly
not
offended
and
that
adds
to
the
drinkability
which
is
topnotch
i
would
be
happy
if
i
found
a
keg
of
becks
at
a
summertime
outdoor
bbq
pours
with
a
nice
creamy
white
head
settling
over
clear
pale
yellow
liquid
nose
is
of
lightly
sweet
maltiness
with
a
grassy
note
light
hops
taste
is
light
bodied
flavors
of
malt
hay
and
restrained
but
noticable
hops
due
to
the
relatively
light
body
finishes
bitter
and
clean
with
the
gentle
alcohol
level
making
it
a
good
summer
quencher
easy
to
drink
lots
of
a
decent
but
not
impressive
pilsner
type
beer
looks
like
a
pils
but
tastes
like
a
bad
version
of
heineken
as
if
heineken
is
good
to
begin
with
weak
all
the
way
through
not
enough
malt
or
hops
to
give
it
anything
to
speak
of
there
are
11
bottles
sitting
on
my
front
porch
which
will
probably
hit
the
trash
can
soon
i
hate
to
waste
beer
and
it
amazes
me
that
a
brewer
that
follows
the
bavarian
purity
law
can
come
up
with
such
an
awful
beer
dont
waste
your
time
this
is
whats
wrong
with
beer
back
when
i
started
drinking
beer
1978
becks
was
one
of
the
few
standard
great
beers
despite
the
postings
i
dont
think
its
changed
much
i
believe
the
old
better
not
bitter
ad
campaign
was
aimed
at
becks
remember
that
pours
as
light
as
any
bad
beer
heavy
hops
up
front
which
taste
almost
stale
very
slightly
above
average
mouth
feel
which
disappears
faster
than
a
scalded
dog
no
after
taste
and
whole
thing
goes
nowhere
never
again
appearance
is
a
straw
color
with
not
much
foam
or
lace
aroma
is
that
of
almost
invisible
hops
sulfur
and
dank
initial
taste
contains
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
hop
taste
with
some
bitterness
malt
also
present
in
minimal
amounts
followed
by
a
nice
dry
finish
pass
purchased
at
the
lcbo
in
sarnia
ontario
tasted
fresh
from
the
get
go
poured
a
medium
straw
color
with
a
full

level
is
full
and
appropriate
for
style
slight
malt
aroma
shines
through
the

neutral
yeasty

flavor
is
slightly
sweet
from
the

and
the
sweetness
carries
on
through

good
stuff
when
it
is
fresh
pours
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
tight
thin
head
that
sticks
around
a
while
and
laces
the
glass
smells
damn
skunky
the
skunk
overpowers
any
other
aroma
that
might
be
there
id
say
its
the
green
bottle
but
i
bought
the
green
bottle
right
next
to
it
and
that
one
wasnt
near
this
bad
taste
is
almost
nonexistent
til
the
backend
bitterness
hits
which
is
considerable
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
almost
like
drinking
foam
very
pleasant
all
in
all
not
bad
if
you
like
a
lot
of
bitterness
without
any
other
real
flavors
taste
is
empty
litle
malts
unfresh
and
hardly
any
bitterness
this
used
to
be
a
decent
brew
but
in
recent
years
went
from
bad
to
worse
imbev
didnt
do
good
for
them
mouthfeel
is
also
missing
some
caracter
no
dont
want
more
of
these
bottle
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
lager
with
no
head
and
very
limited
carbonation
light
floral
malt
aroma
is
detectable
taste
is
extremely
light
and
boring
aftertaste
is
nonexistent
overall
this
beer
totally
lacks
any
inspiration
and
taste
like
some
many
other
macros
out
there
pale
yellow
with
a
head
that
is
big
at
first
but
then
settle
into
a
this
fizzy
lace
smells
slightly
skunk
with
grains
and
faint
hops
taste
fairly
clean
with
a
grassy
grain
and
hop
bitterness
light
bodied
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
not
a
lot
going
on
with
this
beer
just
your
average
euro
lager
that
you
will
pay
too
much
for
next
if
it
wasnt
for
the
smell
at
the
start
i
would
consider
this
to
be
a
good
session
beer
in
fact
it
used
to
be
one
of
my
choices
still
not
a
bad
beer
but
certainly
not
one
of
the
greats
for
nostalgic
reasons
i
cant
completely
slam
becks
if
im
watching
a
soccer
game
in
the
middle
of
summer
one
or
two
of
these
might
go
down
my
throat
pours
a
golden
pilsener
color
very
much
like
the
other
beers
of
this
type
there
is
a
nice
tall
white
layer
of
foam
as
well
the
beer
smells
a
bit
of
skunk
but
i
sense
some
sort
of
sugary
citrus
accents
as
well
not
unlike
the
appearance
the
taste
is
very
similar
to
other
beers
of
its
class
heineken
dab
grolsch
i
think
becks
might
be
a
touch
more
bitter
but
other
than
that
i
would
almost
have
a
rough
time
with
them
in
a
taste
test
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
means
but
i
think
these
european
pilseners
are
a
little
overrated
not
bad
at
all
but
for
the
price
there
are
far
better
beers
to
drink
drinkability
hey
i
love
a
good
hoppy
beer
but
this
is
just
wrong
its
hard
to
concentrate
on
anything
else
but
the
foul
hops
and
the
skunk
nastiness
this
is
a
very
lowrate
euromacro
germanys
1
imported
beer
well
they
sell
a
lot
of
bud
too
doesnt
mean
its
good
beer
i
was
happy
to
find
out
from
an
exgirlfriend
that
was
over
in
germany
for
the
summer
that
becks
is
a
cheapass
beer
to
them
too
as
she
described
it
becks
to
them
is
like
natural
light
to
us
just
avoid
it
mouthfeel
is
ok
better
than
expected
drinkability
is
ok
as
in
australia
becks
often
go
on
sale
so
therefore
it
is
affordable
if
you
had
to
choose
between
a
lower
brand
beer
and
becks
for
the
same
price
its
a
no
brainer
becks
is
definitely
a
very
good
tasting
german
pilsner
although
it
did
have
a
very
skunky
smell
at
first
i
seemed
to
get
used
to
it
after
a
while
although
i
have
never
had
it
on
draft
i
heard
it
is
very
good
that
wasy
as
well
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
anybody
the
smell
is
mostly
of
cheap
grains
and
is
not
very
pleasing
the
taste
isnt
very
good
either
the
finish
brings
a
balance
of
hops
that
just
isnt
very
good
the
drinkability
is
acceptable
but
thats
the
high
point
before
i
was
of
legal
drinking
age
a
friends
older
brother
told
me
you
would
not
get
hangovers
if
you
drink
becks
i
have
proven
him
wrong
time
and
time
again
by
overindulging
in
this
german
delight
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
light
golden
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
the
smell
is
somewhat
skunky
it
has
a
nice
light
refreshing
taste
with
a
slight
malty
notes
this
isnt
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
when
its
around
i
drink
many
of
them
unfortunately
becks
is
a
member
of
the
gblb
green
bottled
lager
brigade
european
division
i
drank
a
fair
amount
of
thismore
becks
dark
actuallyback
in
my
younger
days
im
not
sure
that
i
ever
felt
it
was
good
beer
and
i
most
certainly
dont
feel
that
way
now
while
not
abysmal
it
does
give
german
beer
a
bad
name
this
is
summer
day
at
the
beach
beer
when
good
beer
in
cans
is
hard
to
come
by
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
i
found
this
beer
alongside
budweiser
in
almost
all
of
the
london
tourist
traps
i
visited
last
summer
all
in
all
i
like
it
more
than
others
ive
tried
of
the
same
style
yet
not
having
a
wide
range
of
knowledge
or
sampling
on
this
style
i
can
not
say
how
it
might
fare
against
other
lesser
known
imported
pilsners
for
me
though
one
i
will
be
apt
to
have
again
though
certainly
not
on
any
regular
basis
drinkability
a
guess
it
would
be
an
ok
beer
for
a
hot
day
kinda
like
a
corona
would
be
on
the
beach
in
cancun
when
its
all
you
have
to
choose
from
its
acceptable
at
best
were
sitting
down
with
the
inlaws
to
thanksgiving
dinner
the
game
is
on
and
i
am
on
beeradvocate
com
a
case
of
becks
is
in
the
fridge
so
i
think
its
time
for
a
review
pretty
fizzy
and
yellow
nice
white
head
though
smells
like
not
much
but
it
tickles
my
nose
taste
is
clean
and
a
little
hoppy
nicely
drinkable
alright
not
a
kickass
beer
but
good
in
a
pinch
this
beer
presents
very
differently
ontap
in
bottle
and
in
can
in
my
opinion
very
noticeable
next
to
ontap
favour
the
24ounce
bottles
over
the
12ounce
bottles
and
over
the
12
and
16ounce
cans
on
all
counts
be
warned
the
pricing
for
the
24ounce
bottle
is
usually
a
disincentive
when
compared
to
the
other
forms
sadly
a
marketing
flaw
or
a
price
you
have
to
pay
to
get
a
better
beer
shipped
across
the
pond
m
f
drinkability
good
and
crisp
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
to
find
of
course
this
is
below
average
by
german
standards
but
this
is
one
of
the
better
supermacro
euro
beers
around
overallan
adequate
beer
for
the
style
that
gets
the
job
done
i
would
drink
this
if
offered
but
i
dont
think
it
is
worth
the
extra
money
as
an
import
when
compared
to
beers
that
are
just
as
good
for
less
this
beer
gets
a
lot
for
its
upscale
image
that
is
a
result
of
marketing
instead
of
the
beer
for
what
it
is
though
it
is
a
solid
euro
lager
nothing
more
and
nothing
less

surprise

taste
is

malt
best
before
0505
seems
like
a
long
shelf
life
for
a
lager
yuck
not
a
good
beer
even
as
euro
lagers
go
get
something
else
there
are
tons
of
better
german
beers
becks
is
a
dry
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
and
is
somewhat
bitter
in
the
mouth
w
a
gentle
effervescence
on
the
tongue
exhibiting
latent
pilsner
qualities
the
taste
is
lean
and
dry
and
generally
inviting
i
have
probably
had
this
beer
1k
times
but
never
really
evaluated
or
broke
it
down
into
its
vital
components
before
freshness
is
critical
in
this
mainstream
class
of
product
as
is
drinking
it
young
with
some
hop
notes
taste
is
boring
a
bit
of
malt
up
front
and
then
noble
hops
come
in
and
dry
it
out
becks
has
always
had
a
weird
finish
to
me
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
biting
smooth
but
not
that
smooth
drinkability
is

either

nothing
terrible
about
it

mild
and
its

drink
this
stuff
at
any
bar
in

and
youre
sure
to
get
laid
in
no
time
we
all
know
how
much
the
ladies
love
a
man
who
knows
his
imported
beer
oh
due
to
the
hopping
which
is
often
described
as
skunky
some
find
this
appealing
its
drinkable
but
lacks
in
every
department
boring
as
batshit
but
i
suppose
you
could
drink
a

in

look
elsewhere
though
deep

with

no

hard

i
love
this
beer
smooth
just
the
way
i
like
it
like
the
man
said
while
looking
at
the
nude
picture
i
may
not
know
art
but
i
know
what
i
like
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
very
fizzy
head
that
trails
the
glass
the
smell
was
mostly
alcohol
with
a
bit
of
rice
on
the
back
end
the
taste
wasnt
as
strong
as
i
was
expecting
with
some
rice
up
front
and
then
a
bit
of
hops
on
the
end
but
nothing
too
overwhelming
the
feel
of
it
was
very
thin
for
the
alcohol
content
wasnt
very
impressed
this
beer
do
goo
inside
and
outside
outlier
go
fuck
a
goat
overall
another
poor
offering
from
a
poor
brewer
i
had
this
one
to
get
the
tick
and
the
bottle
cap
but
moved
quickly
to
spotted
cow
at
my
familys
thanksgiving
party
dont
waste
your
time
with
this
beer
had
a
few
of
these
over
the
past
few
days
some
ice
cold
then
one
at
45
and
the
taste
was
much
more
satisfying
a
fine
beer
with
food
better
than
standard
american
becks
pretty
enjoyable
bland
flavor
minimal
malt
hint
of
apple
sweetness
pours
a
golden
crystal
clear
color
head
is
fast
and
leaves
very
quickly
with
no
visible
lacing
to
speak
of
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
continue
their
trek
to
the
top
throughout
the
drinking
process
aroma
is
bready
with
just
a
touch
of
background
skunk
taste
is
ok
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
but
not
sure
if
that
is
the
hops
or
just
a
mediocre

i

it

a

no

not

going
on
the
german
answer
to
bud
light
platinum
or
miller
fortune
why
bother
one
problem
with
this
beer
is
that
it
isnt
a
dark
beer
but
it
nevertheless
comes
in
a
black
bottle
and
advertises
the
name
sapphire
which
gives
you
certain
expectations
that
it

12oz
bottle
brewed
in
st
louis
mo
golden
with
excellent
clarity
frothy
white
head
holds
good
retention
aromas
are
lager
yeast
grassy
hop
very
faint
pilsener
malt
tastes
are
oddly
floral
fruity
earthy
grassy
sweet
no
sharp
finish
as
expected
with
a
pilsener
body
seems
like
its
actually
fuller
than
it
should
be
its
medium
creamy
overall
i
had
a
hard
time
with
this
one
doesnt
have
much
for
pilsener
qualities
odd
flavors
not
good
at
all
corn
and
cereal
taste
orange
flavoring
winey
dirty
and
a
hint
of
cynar
the
artichoke
aperitif
not
trace
of
hop
flavor
after
i
wrote
this
i
see
that
sapphire
refers
to
a
variety
of
hop
overall
there
is
some
beeriness
but
it
is
exactly
what
i
hoped
never
to
taste
in
a
whoops
i
almost
said
german
beer
but
it
is
now
an
inbev
product
made
by
the
former
ab
in
the
st
louis
factory
all
the
discussions
on
if
you
were
ceo
of
a
giant
brewer
are
interesting
when
you
taste
what
they
do
produce
in
contrast
with
what
good
brews
they
could
produce
totally
boring
cant
define
these
sapphire
hops
from
this
beer
warning
not
to
allow
to
warm
drink
ice
cold
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
that
would
make
me
want
to
open
another
one
of
these
kind
of
glad
i
got
this
one
in
a
mixed
6
pack
my
pour
initially
left
me
with
a
finger
of
fizzy
bonewhite
head
that
quickly
reduced
to
wisps
color
was
a
deepgolden
yellow
with
neplus
quality
clarity
enabling
me
to
peer
through
walls
nose
had
an
upfront
sweetish
malty
quality
underlain
by
a
grassy
hoppiness
mouthfeel
was
slightly
thin
and
the
taste
was
much
sweeter
than
what
i
had
expected
what
happened
towith
the
hops
finish
was
likewise
sweet
and
not
really
my
cup
of
tea
it
was
not
a
bad
beer
per
se
just
kind
of
uninspired
not
really
recommended
i
poured
this
disappointing
beer
into
my
tumbler
at
45
degrees
the
beer
was
straw
colored
and
poured
a
nice
head
at
first
however
it
did
not
last
long
the
beer
had
a
srange
taste
like
apple
cider
and
was
just
flat
tasting
i
dont
think
much
effort
went
into
this
new
beer
and
you
could
tell
i
will
not
buy
again
this
beer
is
a
borderline
scam
brewed
on
madison
avenue
more
so
than
bremen
bitter
laugh
or
even
st
louis
ten
years
ago
they
just
called
this
busch
beer
its
a
high
alcohol
content
budweiser
rebranded
as
becks
in
a
distinctive
black
bottle
german
sapphir
hops
aside
this
beer
is
no
german
pilsner
in
any
way
smell
taste
or
form
im
looking
into
my
empty
glass
glumly
trying
to
discern
evidence
of
any
beerrelated
sensory
stimulus
whatsoever
oi
will
not
buy
this
product
again
its
apparently
created
for
an
audience
that
wants
the
big
kick
of
alcohol
without
having
to
develop
a
taste
for
a
fine
brew
its
disguised
as
a
flavorful
hoppy
bohemian
style
pilsener
but
its
all
smoke
and
mirrors
much
better
choices
are
available
for
the
price
product
of
saint
louis
usa
really
and
it
shows
pours
to
a
pale
gold
color
and
34
inch
head
that
falls
to
a
18
inch
layer
of
foam
lacing
is
low
to
none
aroma
is
faint
and
grainy
with
a
hint
of
played
out
noble
hops
flavor
is
bland
and
boozy
with
a
cheap
beer
taste
you
wouldnt
even
expect
from
becks
grainy
slightly
bready
and
sweet
with
a
dry
slick
finish
mouthfeel
is
ok
overall
a
disappointing
beer
that
goes
along
with
the
bud
platinum
trend
never
again
this
poured
out
as
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
on
top
the
retention
was
thin
and
lasted
for
a
little
while
the
lacing
was
basically
nowhere
in
sight
the
smell
of
the
ever
is
slightly
floral
there
is
some
grainy
notes
and
a
tough
of
creaminess
as
well
the
beer
smell
way
better
than
any
other
becks
ive
had
in
the
past
the
taste
is
sweet
there
is
a
dominant
malt
flavor
with
some
cornlike
flavors
as
well
as
this
hops
shining
through
again
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
its
thin
and
carbonated
overall
its
the
best
thing
ive
tried
from
becks
im
glad
it
wasnt
terrible
if
i
had
to
be
a
cheap
date
and
this
was
available
i
would
order
it
the
mouthfeel
isnt
particularly
clean
its
got
a
bit
of
slickness
to
it
right
off
the
bat
though
there
is
a
crispness
as
well
smoothness
comes
out
just
at
the
beginning
and
fades
off
the
longer
the
sip
the
more
a
somewhat
numbing
tingly
alcoholic
touch
hits
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
the
back
of
the
throat
and
tongue
this
is
my
least
favorite
becks
product
that
i
have
tried
to
date
o
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
higher
end
beer
and
a
10
for
a
6
pack
i
expected
something
better
from
becks
to
me
this
brings
nothing
new
to
the
plate
and
if
anything
is
a
step
backwards
the
added
6
of
alcohol
took
away
from
the
taste
of
the
beer
rather
than
adding
to
it
not
worth
the
money
poured
from
a
16
oz
can
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
mild
some
grains
not
much
going
on
taste
is
crisp
light
some
grains
slightly
sweet
a
bit
on
the
mild
side
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
i
liked
it
much
more
than
regular
becks
overall
an
ok
brew
to
sample
they
could
of
done
better
cool
black
bottle
and
label
white
head
with
yellow
golden
color
very
faint
floral
hops
perhaps
a
hint
of
sugary
sweet
and
clean
citrus
aroma
with
a
light
bodied
feel
overall
straight
up
this
does
not
taste
like
any
sapphire
german
beer
ive
had
before
needs
more
hops
not
what
i
was
expecting
id
pass
if
you
are
going
to
boast
about
a
certain
type
of
hop
and
even
make
it
a
part
of
the
beers
name
then
you
need
to
make
sure
it
is
actually
in
the
beer
a
vague
character
of
the
hop
does
not
work
pass
on
this
one
now
i
dont
claim
to
have
as
sophisticated
a
palate
as
a
lot
of
people
on
ba
but
i
kinda
like
this
stuff
granted
there
are
much
better
tasting
beers
but
for
what
it
isa
lighter
tasting
higher
abv
beerits
not
as
bad
as
some
make
it
out
to
be
i
keep
some
around
for
those
times
when
i
want
something
with
a
higher
alcohol
content
that
is
easily
drinkablethis
does
the
job
o
this
is
okay
dont
quite
understand
the
d
score
its
just
average
this
is
a
pale
yellow
beer
with
a
thin
head
and
lower
than
expected
carbonation
the
beer
has
a
cereal
aroma
and
very
faint
spicy
hops
mediocre
smell
and
uninspiring
appearance
the
taste
is
more
appealing
sharper
spicy
a
little
sweetness
faint
malt
clean
and
crisp
thin
mouthfeel
macro
lager
average
at
best
constructive
criticism
thicken
the
head
darken
the
color
pleasurize
the
aftertaste
make
a
more
honest
label
keep
the
abv
this
was
a
disappointment
after
all
the
advertising
i
was
hoping
for
something
special
but
this
is
a
bland
beer
with
nothing
special
i
think
ab
is
trying
to
compete
with
craft
beers
but
all
they
did
was
raise
the
alcohol
level
without
adding
any
taste
also
the
brewery
is
listed
above
as
being
in
germany
thats
not
correct
the
bottle
says
st
louis
mo
the
home
of
ab
but
i
suspect
the
beer
is
brewed
somewhere
else
also
misleading
is
all
the
references
to
germany
and
german
hops
on
the
bottle
carton
its
not
a
german
beer
and
its
not
better
than
the
original
becks
overall
it
seems
like
becks
amped
up
the
alcohol
on
an
already
bland
base
and
possibly
froze
the
result
the
new
sapphire
hop
if
those
were
the
grass
leaf
clipping
taste
lets
hope
they
lose
the
seed
stock
o
far
from
being
a
great
pilsner
but
the
reviews
do
seem
a
bit
biased
against
becks
i
actually
wound
up
enjoying
this
beer
and
would
not
mind
downing
a
sixer
of
these
on
a
summer
day
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
i
didnt
see
a
bottled
date
for
some
reason
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
dark
instead
its
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
long
lasting
white
head
the
smells
are
of
light
crisp
grass
smells
the
feel
is
medium
light
the
taste
isnt
what
i
like
a
light
crisp
hops
mild
malts
not
every
appealing
overall
pretty
average
beer
reminds
me
more
of
an
adjunct
lager
than
a
german
pilsener
flavors
a
re
bland
and
the
smell
is
almost
nonexistent
o
ive
never
had
becks
before
but
was
told
it
was
a
decent
german
macro
not
bad
tastes
like
beer
would
definitely
drink
it
again
if
i
needed
a
stronger
session
beer
but
thats
about
it
overall
im
not
too
impressed
but
really
wasnt
expecting
much
better
to
drink
it
cold
take
a
pass
o
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
normal
becks
and
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
either
the
nose
is
bland
thought
not
offensive
but
i
didnt
really
like
the
sweetness
in
the
taste
and
the
body
is
a
bit
thin
wouldnt
have
it
again
and
wouldnt
reccomend
it
taste
is
decent
with
floral
hop
and
light
pilsner
sweetness
with
low
alcohol
and
hop
bitterness
adding
to
the
smooth
malt
taste
overall
a
decent
lager
but
it
didnt
stand
out
among
the
style
and
pretty
tame
it
could
provide
more
of
a
hop
taste
considering
it
has
the
variety
listed
on
the
label
o
no
real
flavor
or
kick
tastes
like
a
smoothed
out
becks
nothing
special
here
better
off
sticking
with
regular
becks
not
impressed
overalli
dont
think
i
will
be
buying
this
again
feels
and
tastes
like
an
american
beer
not
german
which
isnt
a
bad
thing
i
just
dont
understand
this
release
other
than
to
make
more
money
out
of
an
inferior
product
i
like
becks
but
this
tastes
like
becks
and
budweiser
had
a
baby
and
that
baby
was
left
out
in
the
sun
to
long
then
stumbled
into
a
frat
house
to
become
a
college
beer
2
25
there
is
some
lingering
dryness
on
the
finish
body
is
medium
nothing
bad
about
this
but
nothing
to
recommend
either
except
its
exceptional
clarity
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
below
average
pilsener
seems
like
the
goal
was
to
make
a
cheap
lager
with
higher
than
normal
alcohol
pours
a
clear
honey
orange
with
a
foamy
tan
head
that
settles
to
a
small
amount
of
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
slowly
drip
into
the
remaining
beer
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
and
some
grass
and
hay
aromas
there
is
also
a
slight
vegetal
aroma
that
comes
out
as
the
beer
warms
up
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
grainy
bread
flavor
on
the
finish
there
is
an
extremely
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
with
very
mild
hop
aromas
and
flavors
poured
it
into
the
12
oz
sam
adams
glass
clear
and
gold
with
a
very
shortlived
head
no
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
almost
absent
as
all
i
got
was
a
faint
whiff
of
any
malt
taste
isnt
too
bad
but
there
is
very
little
distinctive
about
it
it
just
has
a
little
sweetness
but
nothing
i
can
put
my
finger
on
and
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
moderate
carbonation
a
little
heavy
on
the
finish
thinner
in
texture
it
might
be
the
one
id
choose
out
of
a
selection
of
mediocre
beers
but
not
one
ill
ever
seek
out
again
of
note
the
beer
color
on
the
packaging
is
decidedly
not
the
color
of
the
beer
when
poured
from
the
bottle
also
interesting
brewed
in
st
louis
by
the
ab
part
of
inbevab
so
its
not
even
a
german
import
anymore
but
clearly
trying
to
appeal
to
that
market
overall
i
never
really
liked
becks
but
this
one
is
as
advertised
smooth
and
somewhat
hoppy
i
guess
a
big
ole
adjunct
bomb
yeah
they
smoothed
out
the
beer
but
it
sacrificed
whatever
flavor
the
traditional
becks
had
i
would
much
prefer
the
traditional
becks
as
it
has
some
resemblance
of
a
german
pilsner
overall
drinkability
about
what
i
expected
should
be
sapphire
but
really
fools
gold
this
is
one
of
the
smoothest
lagers
on
the
market
no
extremely
flavors
or
alcohol
content
so
many
will
under
score
this
brew
its
not
imported
thats
good
news
for
us
beers
because
this
brew
is
equal
to
or
better
than
stella
if
your
looking
for
an
extremely
smooth
lager
this
is
a
fine
choice
overall
a
poor
euro
lager
stripped
of
any
character
in
an
attempt
at
smoothness
o
becks
sapphire
manages
to
bring
fourth
some
hop
flavor
and
presence
in
an
otherwise
ordinary
import
lager
but
it
doesnt
save
it
from
being
mundane
like
its
awful
commercial
this
german
adjunct
lager
isnt
worth
any
elevated
cost
above
the
american
swill
weve
already
got
here
probably
because
its
also
not
made
in
germany
its
made
in
st
louis
overall
first
sip
hints
at
something
like
a
muted
pilsner
but
then
the
sweetness
corn
like
taste
just
starts
dominating
the
emphasis
on
making
this
a
hop
specialty
beer
who
could
tell
just
another
pale
euro
macro
lager
for
the
masses
overall
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
doesnt
hit
you
hard
in
the
pockets
either
it
feels
and
tastes
more
like
a
bolder
becks
for
the
same
price
why
not
salud
i
thought
this
would
atleast
have
some
sort
of
hopiness
seeing
as
its
brewed
exclusively
with
sapphire
hops
but
unfortunately
it
smells
and
tastes
like
most
cheap
adjunct
lagers
ill
stick
to
prima
and
urqell
when
im
caring
a
pilsner
which
isnt
too
often
overall
tastes
very
much
malt
liquor
like
but
without
the
kick
and
at
much
the
higher
price
and
not
available
in
a
40
or
tallboy
size
as
any
appropriate
malt
should
be
stick
with
the
classic
malts
if
you
are
considering
this
this
is
not
really
a
winner
for
the
price
o
i
was
glad
when
i
found
this
as
a
16oz
single
was
interested
in
giving
it
a
shot
but
not
wanting
to
invest
in
the
committment
that
is
a
sixpack
there
was
not
indication
on
the
can
as
to
what
style
they
were
going
for
and
sapphire
sounded
like
a
zima
reboot
or
something
ba
listed
it
as
a
pilsner
which
sounds
right
and
its
not
a
bad
effort
considering
the
source
not
exciting
but
ive
had
worse
examples
from
much
fancier
outfits
picked
up
a
12oz
single
for
reviewing
purposes
only
a
steady
pour
raises
a
nice
fluffy
white
collar
fades
slowly
a
nice
clear
light
gold
underneath
finely
carbonated
nose
unimpressive
domestic
lager
aromas
sweet
malt
and
a
little
sourdough
thrown
in
average
mouthfeel
for
a
light
lager
the
taste
parallels
the
nose
mainly
sweetness
with
scant
hop
bitterness
one
dimensional
lightly
fruity
yet
ersatz
finish
glad
i
didnt
put
out
for
a
sixer
noticed
it
says
product
of
usa
nuff
said
pass
i
dont
enjoy
german
pilseners
with
the
skunky
flavor
profile
like
regular
becks
but
this
is
worse
just
not
a
good
beer
especially
when
it
touts
hops
on
the
label
and
none
are
to
be
tasted
the
black
carp
swimming
around
the
bottle
in
their
super
bowl
ad
ids
the
source
its
from
a
fish
tank
o
i
have
to
say
it
isnt
completely
terrible
very
much
in
the
pilsner
vein
of
things
just
a
little
too
safe
and
restrained
if
youre
going
to
feature
the
sapphire
hop
as
the
main
marketing
point
of
the
beer
i
would
think
youd
want
to
go
a
little
bigger
and
bolder
with
the
hop
profile
getting
away
from
the
green
bottle
has
done
wonders
for
this
beer
too
im
sure
no
skunk
taste
here
o
dont
bother
if
you
like
becks
stick
with
becks
id
call
this
becks
ice
and
price
it
down
about
20
usually
id
approve
of
making
a
stronger
version
of
the
original
if
this
wasnt
so
stupidly
sweet
it
would
be
good
the
sapphire
from
becks
is
a
smoother
version
of
becks
regular
the
beer
pors
a
golden
clear
with
fuzzy
white
head
that
settles
quick
and
does
not
leave
a
lace
the
smell
is
very
tame
basically
nondescript
the
taste
was
a
smooth
well
balanced
pilsner
the
sapphire
hops
do
not
have
the
same
grassy
boldness
of
saaz
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
nice
smooth
pilsner
overall
bland
unremarkable
underwhelming
this
beer
isnt
even
trying
12oz
bottle
copper
with
a
rich
white
head
loads
of
thick
sticky
lacing
smells
floral
and
earthy
wtih
some
citris
notes
lemon
sticks
out
touch
of
lager
must
as
well
its
got
flavor
but
doesnt
remain
in
the
nose
for
long
the
taste
has
a
leafy
and
citric
bite
with
a
bit
more
sweetness
to
it
than
i
was
expecting
which
is
maybe
brought
out
even
more
by
the
fruitiness
of
the
hops
feel
is
medium
with
a
firm
snap
to
it
its
certainly
easy
drinking
for
the
most
part
but
it
plays
too
fast
and
loose
with
the
sweetness
for
a
german
pils
the
saphir
hops
at
least
add
a
little
something
different
to
what
would
normally
be
a
pretty
boring
lager
o
a
barely
decent
german
pilsener
theres
loads
of
better
ones
out
there
i
would
definitely
try
again
and
will
be
more
observant
for
the
next
round
overall
it
is
just
an
average
beer
kind
of
reminds
of
pbr
but
with
more
of
a
jolt
in
some
respects
i
would
liken
this
to
a
slightly
bolder
bud
light
platinum
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
market
basket
pours
a
light
yellow
body
with
little
to
no
head
to
speak
of
bready
malt
shares
the
aroma
with
a
note
of
spicy
continental
hops
spicy
herbal
hops
share
the
flavor
with
bready
malt
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
not
bad
the
hop
flavor
while
far
from
robust
gives
you
a
good
sense
of
what
sapphire
hops
can
bring
to
the
table
not
much
to
add
here
i
havent
had
a
becks
beer
since
the
early
80s
and
i
remember
it
was
decent
this
rendition
however
tastes
like
cheap
malt
liquor
what
happened
it
has
no
resemblance
of
the
german
style
beer
i
remember
its
sweet
tastes
of
corn
and
is
certainly
not
worth
what
i
paid
if
i
get
the
squirts
then
ill
know
its
just
repackaged
beechwood
aged
spew
o
this
is
not
going
to
blow
anyones
socks
off
but
for
a
solid
german
lager
at
bmc
prices
it
certainly
works
crisp
mellow
and
a
better
defined
toasty
malt
flavor
than
i
expected
typical
grassy
hop
flavors
a
little
earthy
overall
pretty
simple
and
easy
to
drink
worth
a
try
if
you
like
pilsners
i
wouldnt
mind
trying
a
side
by
side
taste
test
of
becks
and
sapphire
this
is
barely
better
than
an
american
macro
beer
actually
it
may
not
be
any
better
this
was
a
free
sample
given
to
me
when
i
bought
a
case
of
nugget
nectar
and
for
the
price
that
im
guessing
this
costs
i
would
much
rather
buy
pbr
or
lions
head
or
something
or
genesee
overall
regular
becks
is
much
better
than
this
because
it
actually
has
flavor
this
beer
is
seriously
lacking
the
flavor
department
which
is
very
disappointing
im
glad
i
only
purchased
a
single
o
it
is
what
it
is
onot
very
flavorful
but
highly
drinkable
better
than
your
average
macro
brew
but
still
not
something
i
would
want
every
day
o
flaws
of
omission
in
this
fairly
wellcrafted
lager
create
a
smooth
easy
drinking
beer
thats
lacking
in
both
flavor
and
aromatics
this
hardly
resembles
a
traditional
pilsner
more
towards
a
malt
liquor
without
the
adjuncts
catchy
name
though
by
the
way
this
was
brewed
in
st
louis
mo
becks
has
some
decent
brews
for
a
big
brewery
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
not
good
not
sure
why
were
still
aggregating
becks
under
the
made
in
germany
banner
because
im
one
of
those
who
isnt
really
happy
with
the
move
to
the
usa
but
i
must
admit
i
was
intrigued
by
an
attempt
by
ab
to
provide
a
becks
beverage
that
was
a
bit
differentif
not
much
differentthan
the
green
bottled
pilsner
i
liked
the
opaque
black
bottle
no
green
bottle
skunk
though
i
was
surprised
at
how
light
roughly
gold
in
color
the
beer
was
once
it
hit
the
glass
i
got
a
decent
head
of
white
foam
that
dissipated
quickly
and
left
only
a
hint
on
top
i
agree
with
many
of
the
descriptions
of
the
flavor
here
initial
biscuity
malt
and
a
hint
of
citruslike
hops
in
the
nose
the
carbonation
was
surprisingly
light
and
spritzy
while
the
beer
itself
was
light
to
moderate
in
density
this
made
for
a
strangely
mixed
yet
somewhat
refreshing
mouthfeel
a
tad
sweet
on
the
tongue
with
a
mild
malty
flavor
and
a
hint
of
that
citrusy
hops
flavor
profile
is
onedimensional
and
mild
little
bitterness
at
the
end
and
then
nothing
and
i
mean
that
in
a
good
way
no
off
flavors
no
skunknothing
clean
finish
that
makes
you
smack
your
lips
and
say
gee
i
could
put
a
few
of
these
down
and
i
did
bottom
line
unique
packaging
and
very
drinkable
definitely
something
id
keep
in
my
fridge
from
timetotime
sapphire
isnt
quite
as
devoid
of
flavor
as
some
beers
from
mainstream
producers
but
its
still
pretty
flat
for
an
obvious
attempt
to
siphon
from
the
craft
market
i
wasnt
expecting
much
but
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
what
turned
out
to
be
a
decent
brew
i
dont
think
that
this
beer
will
be
a
regular
addition
to
my
fridge
but
it
may
find
its
way
there
occasionally
overall
i
would
rate
this
beer
as
average
it
wasnt
as
bad
as
i
thought
but
it
was
nothing
memorable
a
good
beer
to
have
when
nothing
else
is
available
already
most
bars
selection
of
beers
only
include
the
above
list
for
european
beers
thankfully
i
only
bought
one
bottle
of
this
stuff
eh
i
wasnt
expecting
much
and
i
wasnt
let
down
maybe
if
i
thought
about
this
as
something
other
than
a
german
pils
i
would
be
a
bit
more
forgiving
but
as
it
stands
this
is
anot
a
good
example
of
that
style
if
this
was
a
malt
liquor
or
american
lager
i
would
say
that
the
score
would
have
improved
much
more
it
doesnt
taste
bad
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
any
german
pilsners
that
i
have
had
thanks
to
some
bossness
at
my
local
the
grandiose
ticker
in
me
was
graced
with
a
single
bottle
o
this
always
best
to
assuage
that
ticking
fool
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
goldenbrass
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
partiallyartificialseeming
banana
soft
wheat
very
light
sweet
flowers
and
a
hint
of
biscuit
the
taste
focuses
on
the
wheat
and
flowers
but
waters
them
down
to
keep
their
edges
from
showing
and
adds
a
heavy
splash
of
sweetness
that
helps
to
drown
them
out
regardless
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slick
feel
overall
if
there
actually
are
any
hops
here
theyre
completely
oerwhelmed
regardless
this
stuff
is
meek
as
all
hell
for
a
pils
or
any
other
kind
of
german
lager
its
far
too
sweet
for
its
own
good
and
any
character
beyond
that
is
ridiculed
into
obscurity
picked
this
up
at
a
grocery
store
for
a
dollar
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
and
yielded
about
two
fingers
of
white
head
the
color
was
very
light
and
clear
tasted
like
a
very
sweet
lager
with
no
aftertaste
i
would
drink
this
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
mowing
the
lawn
overall
it
was
a
nice
light
change
from
stouts

i
had
to
try
this
one
when
it
came
out
it
pours
a
light
amber
golden
with
a
white
head
that
dissapears
as
fast
as
you
can
pour
what
little
foam
remains
leaves
some
slight

it
smells
like
watered
down
beer
if
slightly
underwhelming
unfortunately
pleasant
soon
turns
to
monotonous
you
can
barely
see
through
it
im
short

so
ill
have
to
stick
to
that

is

not
fantastic
but
it
is
a
well
done
pilsner
bolder
aroma
and
increased
hop
bite
would
take
this
to
another
level
overall
a
great
americanmade
pilsner
that
is
perfect
for
the
summer
time
for
those
outside
of
texas
if
youre
a
fan
of
sierra
nevada
summerfest
then
you
will
love
this
i
personally
like
my
pilsners
with
more
of
a
hop
bite
but
im
sure
many
appreciate
the
slightly
sweet
finish
refreshing
light
pilsner
malty
with
a
nice
hop
balance
one
of
my
favorites
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
and
was
well
impressed
just
tried
a
bottled
version
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
am
only
sorry
this
is
a
seasonal
brew
excellent
accompaniment
with
summer
cookouts
flavor
wise
it
goes
even
further
downhill
its
got
a
really
funky
earthy
flavor
almost
musty
and
skunky
its
overcarbonated
and
almost
abrasive
going
down
i
had
to
slow
sip
this
and
im
used
to
nursing
imperial
stouts
it
just
tasted
funky
reminded
me
of
a
wad
of
grass
clippings
it
wasnt
crisp
or
refreshing
reminds
me
of
nasty
macro
aal
beer
no
hop
character
not
smooth
not
enjoyable
at
all
despite
its
early
impressions
summer
pils
turned
out
to
be
a
satisfactory
brew
in
the
end
at
first
take
the
appearance
and
smell
combine
to
form
a
beer
that
seems
to
be
not
much
better
than
pbr
much
of
this
is
forgiven
once
you
take
a
sip
and
are
greeted
by
pleasant
citrus
hop
notes
and
a
decent
mouthfeel
not
my
first
choice
in
pilsners
but
one
could
surely
do
much
worse
while
living
in
houston
for
the
summer
overall
maybe
its
me
but
i
really
like
to
taste
pils
malt
in
my
pils
its
got
some
sweetness
kicking
around
in
the
back
and
some
sides
to
the
front
but
its
only
when
you
swig
it
all
around
the
mouth
do
you
get
some
as
it
hits
all
parts
of
the
tongue
at
the
same
time
and
then
after
awhile
i
taste
lots
of
sweet
pils
malt
but
still
its
hard
to
find
it
from
mouthfeel
its
a
typical
german
yet
the
aroma
is
poor
and
reminds
me
of
a
fernsehbier
im
torn
whether
i
like
this
beer
for
the
american
market
maybe
a
very
bitter
beer
with
little
pils
malt
flavor
is
a
winner
but
not
for
me
again
i
want
pils
in
my
pils
and
a
pils
without
a
decent
amount
of
the
pils
malts
showing
up
is
a
weak
beer
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
im
not
saying
id
drink
this
as
a
summer
beer
a
3
4
of
5
high
c
overall
this
was
an
ok
brew
the
summer
pils
poured
a
light
straw
color
with
a
substantial
head
it
had
a
bright
light
taste
and
body
that
helped
beat
the
hot
afternoon
there
was
enough
flavor
to
keep
things
interesting
and
bold
but
without
weighing
itself
down
while
not
being
on
the
level
of
some
of
the
top
pilsners
in
the
world
it
is
a
solid
texas
pilsner
overall
its
refreshing
and
summery
a
fine
summer
beer
d
dms
has
kind
of
stamped
its
way
onto
this
brew
and
is
not
letting
go
from
the
nose
to
the
palate
it
is
a
bit
distracting
without
much
hop
presence
this
is
a
big
pass
from
me
its
a
very
good
beer
pours
golden
yellow
with
2
finger
width
foamy
head
with
some
carbonated
bubbles
head
quickly
dissipates
leaving
very
little
lacing
on
glass
aroma
of
stale
fruits
that
is
typical
of
lagers
taste
of
pilsner
malts
up
front
followed
by
mild
hop
bitterness
and
stale
fruit
possibly
banana
not
really
a
fan
of
lagers
but
this
one
is
refreshing
and
decent
to
drink
in
the
summer
around
the
pool
overall
after
the
first
i
enjoyed
this
with
homemade
guacamole
and
it
was
a
perfect
match
for
fresh
jalapeno
and
cilantro
i
plan
on
buying
several
6
packs
of
this
for
entertaining
people
who
drink
light
beer
alongside
mexican
meals
a
superior
pilsner
to
most
market
bulk
buys
but
its
not
spectacular
id
love
to
say
it
is
but
its
overall
character
is
just
a
tick
above
average
nothing
more
so
its
april
in
houston
and
that
means
its
summer
time
again
i
saw
saint
arnolds
seasonal
change
once
again
so
i
grab
a
six
as
i
always
do
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
although
sometimes
i
drink
this
one
straight
from
the
bottle
aggressive
pour
right
down
the
center
makes
a
huge
white
foamy
head
that
i
know
wont
stick
around
golden
yellow
with
little
lacing
as
the
glass
goes
down
little
nose
on
it
just
a
wheaty
scent
just
an
average
pils
for
me
i
use
to
drink
this
more
but
it
seems
my
tastes
have
changed
over
the
years
its
a
good
sessionable
beer
but
thats
about
all
just
average
in
my
opinion
o
an
awesome
summer
beer
definitely
sessionable
and
would
be
great
to
drink
on
a
riding
lawnmower
on
a
hot
summers
day
good
stuff
a
good
pils
that
i
could
drink
more
of
on
a
hot
summer
day
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
pale
golden
with
a
white
head
there
are
plenty
of
streaming
tiny
bubbles
visible
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
there
is
some
lacing
left
behind
as
the
head
dissipates
the
beer
smells
of
biscuit
and
cracker
with
some
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
there
is
the
grainy
character
from
the
pale
malts
that
lends
the
biscuit
character
the

lend
some
subtle
background
citrus
and
bitter
flavors
the
body
is
light
with
plentiful
carbonation
the
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
the

is
very
high
this
is
an
excellent
beer

slight
retention
and
slight

smells
of
pale
malt
wheat
hint
of
sweet
malt
and
hint
of

fits
the
style
of
a
german
pilsner
mouth
feel
is
smooth

clean
with
an
average
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
slight
sweet

hint
of
hops
and
a
hint
of
wheat
overall
good
feel
decent
appearance
and
good
blend
lacking
in
body
and
aroma
though
overall
great
summer
beer
especially
when
extremely
cold
i
have
also
drunk
this
from
a
bottle
and
my
opinion
of
it
did
not
change
good
texas
beer
and
that
is
not
just
because
i
am
from
houston
this
is
what
i
would
call
an
american
pils
its
a
standard
golden
color
pour
it
vertically
if
you
want
any
amount
of
head
on
it
because
itll
be
gone
in
a
couple
minutes
it
otherwise
maintains
its
carbonation
throughout
theres
very
little
scent
from
this
the
taste
is
light
and
crisp
similar
to
an
american
lager
its
just
bitter
enough
to
leave
a
small
bit
of
aftertaste
my
personal
preference
is
a
pils
with
big
hops
this
is
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
and
youll
want
to
hammer
it
down
lest
it
get
warm
its
probably
worth
a
putting
a
six
pack
on
the
fridge
this
summer
to
see
if
you
like
it
ill
be
moving
on
to
a
good
kolsch
or
a
hoppier
pils
tho
i
might
just
pick
up
another
six
of
sa
summer
pils
o
good
summertime
beer
goes
best
with
the
hot
texas
weather
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
in
this
brew
are
going
to
seem
a
bit
weak
to
hopheads
and
craft
beer
enthusiasts
but
theyre
cleanly
done
and
come
through
exactly
as
intended
with
no
offflavors
or
skunkiness
pleasant
to
knock
back
a
couple
of
these
after
working
in
the
yard
on
a
summer
day
overall
i
love
this
beer
i
wish
it
was
available
in
more
stores
in
baton
rouge
the
aroma
was
loaded
down
with
cereal
grains
and
a
touch
of
light
fruity
yeast
the
aroma
of
banana
clearly
evident
as
was
a
nice
fresh
grass
like
hoppy
nose
the
flavor
followed
right
along
with
it
being
very
light
in
profile
and
feel
and
very
highly
carbonated
list
grain
flavors
dominated
with
a
nice
earthy
feel
hints
of
banana
and
fresh
grass
running
through
it
as
well
with
a
very
nice
light
refreshing
taste
awesome
beer
one
of
my
favorite
examples
of
a
pilsner
and
lagers
in
general
d
very
drinkable
and
smooth
o
i
am
biased
toward
liking
st
arnold
however
i
like
other
s
a
styles
better
average
o
decent
pilsner
heavier
than
most
oi
actually
like
this
pils
although
i
am
not
a
fan
of
the
style
if
im
ever
in
texas
on
a
budget
ina
hot
summers
day
ill
grab
a
few
why
not
o
overall
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
from
saint
arnolds
i
could
see
myself
buying
a
six
pack
of
this
to
help
combat
the
scorching
oklahoma
heat
right
now
definently
a
lawn
mower
beer
i
would
have
it
again
rjt
while
this
isnt
as
hoppy
as
id
like
it
to
be
for
a
pilsner
this
is
still
a
good
beer
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
to
choose
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
texas
day
o
a
good
pilsener
and
a
great
summer
session
beer
overall
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
white
onefinger
head
that
dissipated
fairly
quickly
very
little
grassy
aroma
taste
is
a
bit
bready
nutty
and
grassy
mouth
feel
is
good
and
this
has
proper
carbonation
had
this
after
stoudt
pils
which
is
a
superior
beer
and
might
have
influenced
my
rating
still
this
is
a
decent
pils
that
is
refreshing
actually
liked
this
better
than
the
first
bottle
i
tried
somewhat
of
a
disappointment
as
every
other
st
arnold
beer
i
have
had
fancy
lawnmower
winter
stout
spring
bock
and
divine
reserve
have
been
way
above
average
o
not
the
best
pils
in
the
world
but
i
really
like
this
beer
on
a
hot
day
could
easily
down
a
sixer
of
these
refreshing
with
enough
taste
to
keep
it
interesting
at
the
price
point
i
will
probably
make
this
a
regular
in
my
fridge
during
the
texas
summer
clear
gold
body
medium
carbonation
under
gleaming
bright
white

slow

with
good

a

nose
is

dry
bready
malts
floral
hops
taste
mirrors
nose
mouthfeel
is
medium
crisp
and
dry
finish
the
best
texas
pilsener
ive
had
so
far
o
a
bit
better
than
bmc
bc
of
hop
bitterness
the
smell
and
body
are
underwhelming
at
best
probably
a
good
summer
beer
as
the
title
suggests
id
chug
one
after
mowing
the
lawn
but
thats
about
it
im
fairly
sure
ive
over
rated
this
beer
not
bad
at
all
very
refreshing
great
time
of
year
for
this
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
with
some
bready
malt
the
flavor
is
hoppy
but
the
breadtoffee
malt
make
the
beer
very
well
balanced
there
is
some
grassyness
in
the
flavor
from
the
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
nice
easy
drinking
balanced
pilsner
nothing
too
exciting
but
a
good
beer
to
drink
the
hot
months
o
a
very
good
beer
that
i
could
drink
alot
of
if
not
for
this
esteracetaldehyde
issue
it
interferes
with
each
sniff
taste
o
hope
that
it
lagers
out
and
is
not
an
issue
from
a
too
warmtoo
quick
fermenation
maybe
nitpicking
but
for
a
beer
that
should
be
drunk
young
and
fresh
i
wouldnt
mind
a
little
less
filtrationa
little
haze
for
authenticity
o
could
have
had
more
of
the
spicy
hop
bite
i
like
in
germanczech
pilseners
a
definite
step
up
from
the
macros
nothing
memorable
here
but
still
worthy
of
a
purchase
in
the
upcoming
months
this
was
7
99
at
heb
to
me
a
nice
value
and
i
will
buy
again
when
i
am
in
the
area
i
am
tired
of
8
99
or
9
99
6
packs
compared
to
its
texas
cousin
shiner
101
czech
pilsner
which
was
a
bit
more
aggressive
this
one
was
much
more
laid
back
between
the
german
pils
of
st
arnold
and
czech
pils
of
shiner
i
am
leaning
more
towards
shiner
i
guess
i
just
prefer
czech
pilsners
provided
shiner
and
st
arnolds
made
a
brew
true
to
its
style
disclaimer
i
just
started
taste
testing
pilsners
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
serious
lack
of
bubbles
light
corn
in
the
aroma
with
a
pleasing
grassy
hop
note
the
soft
mouthfeel
could
be
crispened
up
for
refreshment
purposes
a
little
corny
in
the
taste
with
a
mild
bitterness
im
not
crazy
about
the
aftertaste
all
that
in
mind
its
not
horrible
and
i
would
drink
several
of
these
outside
on
a
hot
day
poured
into
a
pilsner
flute
glass
looks
great
pours
with
a
two
inch
head
that
leaves
behind
a
good
layer
of
foam
after
it
settles
the
body
is
very
light
and
not
hazy
at
all
smells
very
malty
and
slightly
sweet
not
much
hop
detection
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
immediately
sweet
and
finishes
with
a
crisp
bitterness
this
is
a
nicely
flavored
and
light
beer
but
its
a
touch
to
sweet
for
my
liking
within
the
style
ideally
speaking
of
course
i
would
have
it
again
though
edit
checked
the
website
s
a
calls
it
a
boheiman
pils
score
just
jumped
this
beer
nails
the
style
drinkability
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
saint
arnold
makes
some
of
the
most
refreshing
beers
ive
had
not
surprising
given
that
theyre
based
in
houston
this
isnt
the
best
beer
out
there
but
good
for
a
summer
bbq
d
not
nearly
as
bad
as
the
fancy
lawnmower
but
not
all
that
good
either
i
suppose
if
it
was
ice
cold
you
might
be
able
to
put
a
few
of
these
away
this
is
a
fine
refreshing
pilsener
that
would
make
a
great
session
beer
for
the
summer
overall
this
is
pretty
okay
hops
though
need
more
other
than
that

dont

used

a
tryhardtargetmay
11
i
think
this
is
probably
saint
arnolds
best
offering
and
one
i
eagerly
await
each
year
its
not
as
elegant
or
complex
as
its
european
stylistic
predecessors
a
pilsner
with
nearly
the
body
of
a
pale
ale
and
a
good
taste
and
equally
solid
finish
to
boot
this
the
beer
i
drink
my
regular
in
the
keg
late
spring
and
summer
simple
and
refreshing
great
to
come
home
to
after
fishing
better
than
lemonade
like
if
miller
lite
was
any
good
great
beer
just
a
touch
fruity
pils
taste
overall
pretty
much
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
for
the
hoppy
pilsner
style
crisp
hoppy
and
very
drinkable
it
might
go
juuust
slightly
overboard
on
the
hops
for
my
taste
but
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
any
old
time
an
excellent
beer
i
dont
really
get
the
relative
hype
on
this
beer
if
you
want
a
pilsner
with
no
flavor
i
guess
its
a
good
choice
but
theres
much
better
craft
pilsners
out
there
pours
a
light
gold
smells
like
wheat
and
bananas
tastes
very
refreshing
a
really
enjoyable
beer
prosit
it
looked
good
but
tasted
putrid
they
all
taste
nearly
identical
but
i
could
drink
these
all
night
if
there
was
nothing
more
interesting
just
sweet
and
hoppy
enough
would
like
just
a
bit
more
dry
and
crisp
but
im
splitting
hairs
a
great
pilsner
just
not
that
good
bitter
ever
since
i
lived
in
prague
for
six
months
ive
been
chasing
the
dragon
for
a
solid
domestic
pilsner
this
beer
is
the
closest
ive
come
to
satisfying
that
craving
my
hope
is
that
my
purchasing
large
quantities
of
this
beer
will
help
the
microbrew
movement
move
away
from
constant
ipas
and
branch
out
into
more
europeanstyle
pilsners
decent
pilsner
had
it
draft
a
little
skunky
that
threw
me
off
other
than
the
skunkiness
i
though
it
was
a
good
representation
of
a
german
pilsner
overall
just
a
really
tasty
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
prima
is
a
worldclass
pilsner
one
of
the
first
american
beers
i
tried
years
back
that
stood
up
to
the
classics
of
that
style
it
remains
at
the
top
of
the
class
in
what
now
may
be
an
underappreciated
category
here
in
the
states

o

go

great
for

less
filling

with

and
moderate

pours
a

color
no

smells
bready
slightly
sweet
and
has
a
noticeable

in
there
tastes
fuckin
great

a
very
subtle
hop

comes
through
towards
the
end
of
my

light

easy
to
drink
awesome
pils
i
dont
think
american
pilsner
gets
better
than
this
sometimes
over
carbonated
refreshing
pilsner
great
taste
with
a
little
bite
good
choice
when
you
need
a
cold
one
overall
im
not
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
but
i
do
really
enjoy
this
brew
if
im
looking
for
something
on
the
lighter
side
to
drink
that
wont
screw
me
out
of
flavor
i
had
this
on
draft
at
the
houlihans
in
parsippany
i
read
the
other
reviews
before
ordering
and
thought
i
was
getting
more
of
a
fruity
beer
its
just
a
regular
old
pilsner
certainly
not
bad
but
not
anything
to
get
excited
about
served
on
tap
almost
no
head
nice
bitter
finish
and
good
feel
ill
need
to
try
this
from
the
bottle
outstanding
session
beer
truly
one
of
my
favorite
german
pilsners
ive
had
it
before
and
enjoyed
it
each
time
this
will
continue
to
be
a
go
to
beer
for
me
average
better
than
your
super
mass
produced
but
not
as
good
as
others
smells
sweet
and
floral
taste
is
initial
sweetness
quickly
chased
by
bitterness
floral
spicy
hops
slightly
overshadow
the
biscuity
malt
but
not
by
much
good
carbonation
pleasantly
prickly
bubbles
finishes
very
clean
great
for
crushing
in
the
summer
or
as
a
breather
among
the
heavy
stouts
in
winter
love
this
one
no
matter
what
the
season
the
hop
taste
is
straight
at
ya
almost
daring
you
to
let
it
linger
when
you
do
let
it
linger
the
hops
taste
fades
slowly
and
as
the
intensity
dies
down
ready
for
another
swig
sorry
but
all
metallic
in
flavour
and
somewhat
sulphurous
not
sure
if
a
bad
bottle
or
batch
but
wont
revisit
overall
nice
refreshing
beer
will
definitely
drink
agaiin
light
golden
perfection
enjoyed
from
a
12
oz
bottle
in
a
pint
glass
this
pils
pours
a
lightly
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
decent
white
head
and
light
lacing
nose
of
lightly
sweet
malt
spicy
and
bittering
hops
and
some
yeast
notes
with
a
light
grain
background
flavors
are
sweet
malt
backbone
to
the
fore
and
back
with
spicy
hops
and
bittering
hops
rounding
it
all
together
very
nice
carbonation
keeps
it
lively
and
high
on
the
session
scale
of
drinkability
lightly
bitter
aftertaste
with
some
grain
background
good
if
you
like
your
pils
with
a
bittering
hop
background
tried
this
again
and
was
very
impressed
cracker
malts
in
harmony
with
the
spicy
hops
finishes
dry
and
the
hops
linger
in
the
mouth
in
a
good
way
im
not
much
of
a
pilsner
fan
but
have
to
say
this
one
has
so
much
flavor
its
fantastic
ogreat
beer
but
not
my
cup
of
tea
overall
great
beer
especially
if
you
like
hops
my
ideal
german
pils
is
a
bit
more
bready
and
grassy
but
i
never
say
no
to
this
beer
outstanding
continental
pils
malt
foundation
with
the
crisp
hop
profile
found
across
the
pond
awesome
example
of
the
style
pours
a
pale
almost
clear
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
the
head
settles
down
taking
on
a
nice
creamy
quality
and
adding
a
little
sticky
lacing
the
aroma
is
distinct
with
light
bread
notes
earthy
and
citrus
hops
the
taste
is
actually
a
little
hop
forward
dialing
back
the
malt
in
favor
of
the
two
competing
hops
notes
the
malt
is
more
of
a
background
note
it
has
a
sharp
crispness
to
it
and
some
carbonation
on
the
finish
overall
this
one
is
well
executed
and
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
hop
character
before
a
bready
and
malty
finish
super
drinkable
nice
citrus
and
tangy
profile
in
the
nose
o
the
definitive
american
pilsner
that
will
have
good
competitors
but
none
cant
beat
rating
is
based
on
american
pilsner
and
not
necessarily
the
foreign
style
excellent
a
tangy
clean
and
crisp
pils
taste
starts
out
with
the
malt
sweetness
with
a
decent
hop
presence
hops
are
slightly
more
citrusy
than
the
nose
indicated
yet
still
retain
their
grassiness
well
balanced
without
any
element
being
overly
strong
very
easy
to
drink
carbonation
is
medium
with
a
body
that
is
light
yet
not
thin
which
is
quite
difficult
to
pull
off
o
awesome
pilsner
crisp
and
bright
flavors
are
strong
well
carbonated
medium
light
body
refreshing
well
made
taste
unlike
pilsner
urquell
it
is
a
lot
hoppier
malt
is
about
the
same
as
pu
but
the
hops
linger
and
eventually
overpower
the
other
flavors
above
average
carbonation
about
as
light
as
you
would
expect
from
a
pislner
but
it
seems
quirky
because
this
level
of
hops
is
usually
prominent
in
heavier
beers
o
was
quite
happy
to
stumble
into
this
one
normally
not
carried
anywhere
near
my
area
pretty
refreshing
and
drinkable
brew
to
help
beat
the
heat
there
is
no
hint
of
malt
after
the
nose
and
there
is
no
lasting
dense
head
or
lacing
the
bitterness
is
more
than
expected
or
wanted
probably
too
much
for
the
style
overall
this
is
lightyears
better
than
the
last
bottle
of
this
i
had
that
one
was
clearly
off
always
check
bottle
dates
and
thank
you
victory
for
having
them
still
if
the
goal
is
a
clear
crisp
easydrinker
this
is
off
the
mark
the
hops
on
the
finish
are
just
too
strong
in
terms
of
enjoyment
id
put
mamas
lil
yella
and
summerfest
both
czech
ahead
of
this
this
is
one
of
my
goto
beers
hoppy
but
not
an
ipa
mellow
but
not
a
budweiser
you
can
take
it
tailgating
or
to
an
oyster
roast
just
an
excellent
allaround
beer
o
very
good
pilsner
shouldve
had
it
colder
though
everyone
has
different
flavor
filters
mine
says
this
its
good
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
pills
for
my
liking
pleasent
earthy
flavor
i
liked
it
will
drink
again
i
prefer
skrimshaw
for
an
american
pills
but
this
one
shows
up
quite
well
with
a
meal
refreshing
and
crisp
the
best
pilsner
that
i
have
ever
had
the
hops
are
perfect
and
finished
very
dry
too
hoppy
for
my
taste
but
if
you
are
looking
for
a
hoppy
pilsner
this
is
your
beer
if
you
like
pilsner
style
beers
this
one
is
certainly
worth
a
try
o
3
5
points
docked
for
tasting
far
more
an
ipa
than
a
pilsner
overall
one
of
the
best
lagers
that
ive
had
this
is
what
green
bottled
euro
beers
should
probably
taste
like
if
they
werent
always
skunked
id
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
with
this
one
o
ill
admit
that
im
a
few
steps
away
from
a
pilsner
hater
theyre
just
not
my
thing
and
ive
accepted
that
im
not
going
to
like
every
beer
style
i
picked
up
prima
pils
for
two
reasons
honestly
first
off
my
pop
is
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
and
lagers
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
praised
american
german
pils
around
and
secondly
victory
is
a
local
brewery
that
offers
several
beers
that
i
adore
so
i
felt
obligated
to
at
least
entertain
their
pilsner
offering
im
almost
reluctant
to
admit
that
i
love
this
beer
its
not
one
of
my
dearly
beloved
ipas
or
stouts
but
this
beer
quite
frankly
is
effin
delicious
its
light
yet
flavorful
its
toptier
yet
available
and
given
that
summer
is
only
midway
through
you
can
bet
this
will
be
the
beer
of
choice
in
my
family
bbq
coolers
o
overall
i
am
very
pleased
with
this
beer
i
dont
tend
to
like
pilsner
as
much
as
other
styles
but
this
one
got
my
attention
i
wouldnt
turn
one
down
thankfully
they
are
offered
year
round
and
victory
is
located
in
the
state
i
live
in
definitely
bringing
more
of
this
home
and
it
might
make
an
appearance
at
my
wedding
in
september
a
good
overall
pilsener
smooth
taste
and
easy
drinking
crisp
taste
with
an
overall
light
feeling
to
it
ideal
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
to
nitpick
but
the
price
is
a
bit
high
compared
to
many
other
beers
still
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
turn
on
down
o
have
to
say
im
a
bit
disappointed
with
prima
especially
after
reading
that
it
is
among
the
absolute
best
in
the
style
same
as
with
sierra
nevada
summerfest
which
is
nice
of
course
but
also
fails
to
impress
me
in
any
way
certainly
nothing
bad
to
report
but
while
interesting
also
a
little
underwhelming
at
its
price
o
picked
this
up
on
a
whim
and
was
not
disappointed
what
i
found
here
was
a
classic
european
pilsner
done
american
style
with
a
slightly
amplified
hop
profile
though
if
i
were
to
complain
id
say
the
malt
profile
was
a
bit
lackluster
still
you
could
do
far
worse
if
youre
looking
for
a
good
american
pilsner
this
is
the
first
brew
ive
reviewed
from
this
brewery
and
im
pretty
impressed
thus
far
cheers
perfect
summer
after
noon
beer
definitely
hits
the
beer
spot
a
victory
for
victory
very
light
yellow
clear
see
thru
the
nose
is
a
sweet
cracker
light
skunk
hop
the
taste
follows
with
less
sweetness
and
more
of
the
skunk
spice
hop
simple
malt
profile
and
balance
of
hops
thin
and
prickly
good
pils
though
i
have
some
slightly
better
i
randomly
grabbed
this
one
at
the
end
of
work
a
week
ago
and
i
have
to
say
i
fell
in
love
with
it
totally
not
at
all
what
i
expected
in
the
best
way
possible
it
pours
thin
and
clear
with
a
light
golden
tone
and
a
tall
foamy
head
smells
very
nice
with
a
smooth
citrus
kick
and
a
light
piney
undertone
i
was
completely
surprised
when
i
first
tasted
it
its
crisp
and
vibrant
with
a
smooth
tone
of
malts
i
definitely
tasted
notes
of
pine
and
citrus
from
those
hops
altogether
its
an
amazing
beer
like
hop
devil
but
a
little
less
pine
and
bitterness
a
pilsner
by
name
but
this
isnt
fooling
anyone
its
an
ipa
meh
another
highly
rated
beer
completed
wont
be
drinking
many
more
of
these
bitter
and
piney
beers
they
just
dont
do
it
for
me
maybe
the
solution
is
to
make
a
new
beer
style
the
märican
pils
defined
as
being
super
noble
hoppy
and
virtually
no
pils
malt
sweetness
o
victorys
prima
pils
arrests
nearly
all
malt
interaction
focusing
heavily
on
the
german
noble
hops
and
their
delicate
floral
and
herbal
characteristics
dry
and
balanced
towards
bitterness
prima
pils
is
a
crisp
refreshing
beer
thats
hard
not
to
gulp
down
and
a
standout
among
americanbrewed
pilsners
o
great
pilsner
great
balance
with
a
great
hop
presence
wish
there
was
more
aroma
overall
is
this
a
good
represetation
of
the
style
it
has
more
body
and
flavor
than
any
other
pilsner
ive
had
which
is
a
good
thing
drinks
more
like
a
pale
ale
in
my
opinion
a
solid
choice
for
a
summer
beer
my
favorite
pils
to
date
would
definitely
suggest
checking
the
born
on
date
with
this
style
of
victory
beer
as
it
does
tend
to
flatten
out
as
it
ages
with
my
expirences
and
is
just
not
great
when
it
looses
that
crispness
33cl
bottle
ours
clear
pale
golden
with
small
white
airy
head
pure
malt
aroma
and
taste
hops
kick
in
at
the
finish
providing
nice
bite
pure
and
simple
pilsner
lots
of
bread
and
biscuit
malt
presence
simple
clean
hops
on
the
tail
end
nice
clean
finish
overall
an
awesome
meeting
of
lager
and
ipa
done
well
hoppy
pilsner
like
an
ipa
mated
with
a
lager
what
else
can
you
say
very
hoppy
somewhat
creamy
in
the
mouth
hoppy
smelling
leaves
a
hop
taste
in
your
mouth
a
bit
of
a
palette
wrecker
but
you
can
probably
drink
past
it
drink
this
after
youre
done
with
the
serious
drinking
for
the
evening
o
maybe
the
six
pack
i
bought
was
old
but
if
the
beer
actually
left
some
lacing
and
actually
had
a
head
this
would
be
an
a
beer
for
me
overall
i
think
its
a
fantastic
beer
great
for
the
summer
and
cant
wait
to
buy
more
a
great
pilsner
definitely
up
there
with
some
of
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
tried
in
fact
it
could
very
possible
be
the
best
of
the
style
i
have
tried
dont
pass
up
trying
this
one
if
you
get
the
chance
o
one
of
the
best
pilseners
ive
ever
had
period
this
has
all
the
tell
tale
signs
of
a
well
crafted
pilsner
whether
its
the
bright
clean
golden
body
or
the
heavy
froth
for
a
top
this
pilsner
sets
up
well
the
nose
is
bready
with
cracker
and
pilsner
malts
the
flavor
is
strong
yet
light
to
feel
as
a
cracker
bread
toast
cereal
malt
and
a
dash
of
hops
glide
across
the
tongue
this
is
what
pilsners
all
should
be
o
a
solid
offering
and
one
ill
hit
from
time
to
time
but
the
extrabitter
bite
is
too
floral
for
my
pilsenertaste
buds
still
the
fact
that
its
a
bit
different
from
most
good
german
pilseners
is
a
good
thing
offering
a
bit
of
a
changeup
from
the
more
classic
noblehop
profile
found
in
most
of
my
favorite
pilseners
ill
have
to
echo
many
of
the
other
reviewers
that
this
is
certainly
not
a
german
pils
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
it
is
however
a
solid
offering
from
the
always
consistent
victory
stable
i
liken
this
to
a
consistancy
of
a
zwickel
actually
although
it
is
not
unfiltered
is
has
a
much
more
syrupy
and
hop
forward
flavor
then
a
crisp
and
clear
german
pils
lager
would
it
is
however
highly
sessionable
and
incredibly
flavorful
for
a
lager
of
its
kind
and
i
could
put
down
a
few
of
these
easily
on
a
warm
day
overall
this
brew
rocks
i
enjoy
the
gordon
biersch
czech
pils
before
attending
coyote
hockey
games
and
it
has
been
a
favorite
until
now
seek
this
beer
out
if
you
are
looking
for
a
flavorful
session
brew
a
solid
sessionable
hop
forward
pilsener
prima
pils
is
rather
dark
for
the
style
yet
has
a
nice
fluffy
head
when
poured
into
a
glass
what
hits
you
first
is
the
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
also
hopaccented
to
the
point
that
i
cannot
appreciate
the
malt
body
i
am
not
sure
why
dry
hopping
has
invaded
every
beer
style
on
the
planet
since
it
was
never
intended
for
most
of
them
prima
pils
is
a
solid
american
micro
pilsener
but
certainly
not
a
german
pilsner
as
they
say
on
their
website
it
is
way
too
far
out
of
balance
i
taste
great
potential
in
this
beer
but
it
lets
me
down
in
being
just
another
blast
of
hops
like
a
run
of
the
mill
west
coast
ipa
overall
a
very
good
german
pilsner
and
a
great
session
beer
will
certainly
become
a
regular
in
the
warmer
weather
the
fact
that
this
beer
was
a
pils
after
i
tasted
it
was
mind
blowing
it
definitely
caught
me
off
guard
but
in
a
good
delicious
i
cant
get
enough
of
this
beer
type
of
way
normal
pils
dont
taste
as
if
theyll
surprise
you
and
that
they
all
taste
the
same
not
this
one
id
buy
this
again
for
sure
o
this
is
not
an
ordinary
run
of
the
mill
pils
it
presents
some
robust
flavors
with
an
aggressive
hop
profile
for
a
pils
and
really
stands
out
victory
pumps
out
some
good
brews
prima
pils
is
really
easy
to
drink
yet
there
are
subtleties
to
the
beer
that
suggest
this
isnt
a
beer
to
be
pounded
despite
how
easy
one
could
do
just
that
theres
a
nice
medley
of
sweet
bitter
and
yeasty
all
at
play
here
and
i
enjoy
it
pours
light
golden
color
with
thick
foamy
head
very
strong
pleasing
citrus
aroma
fruit
filled
taste
with
citrus
apples
and
pineapples
mild
hoppy
bitterness
i
prefer
ipa
type
hoppiness
and
am
not
really
a
lager
drinker
but
this
one
doesnt
disappoint
probably
the
best
lagerpilsner
that
i
have
tasted
would
definitely
use
as
a
session
beer
this
takes
me
back
to
the
glory
days
of
what
stella
artois
was
great
traditional
pilsner
that
takes
you
back
thanks
for
breweries
like
victory
and
the
craft
industry
to
bring
back
quality
and
great
taste
awesome
beer
o
simply
the
best
pilsner
i
have
ever
tasted
its
not
only
about
whats
there
but
also
about
whats
not
there
no
stale
skunky
or
off
flavors
just
clean
pilsner
taste
in
a
richer
package
than
expected
i
honestly
cant
imagine
how
it
can
be
improved
when
i
want
a
pilsner
this
is
the
beer
i
will
be
drinking
overall
i
was
impressed
this
was
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
the
reason
i
was
impressed
was
because
the
appearance
had
that
of
a
lager
but
did
not
taste
like
one
had
a
nice
amount
of
complexity
as
well
true
to
the
fact
that
victory
is
a
maker
of
great
beers
prima
pils
has
a
lot
of
flavor
give
it
a
try
beautiful
pour
with
light
honeyed
color
thick
creamy
head
and
just
a
suggestion
of
haze
nose
is
very
appetizing
with
some
herbal
leafy
hop
qualities
and
a
hint
of
breadygrainy
aromas
palate
offers
a
whollop
of
flavors
with
ample
hoppiness
coming
through
herbal
and
pleasantly
sharp
with
some
nice
malt
in
the
background
to
tame
things
just
a
little
incredibly
flavorful
yet
drinkable
at
the
same
time
a
masterpiece
of
a
pils
when
judged
against
the
american
competition
bravo
o
one
of
the
top
pilsners
on
the
market
and
an
essential
reference
point
to
the
style
in
america
best
on
tap
but
it
doesnt
lose
enough
in
bottle
to
knock
it
down
at
all
worth
a
drink
whenever
you
see
it
around
serving
vessel
stein
with
wurst
kraut
and
mustard
o
good
pils
for
sure
not
super
hopped
but
good
kick
o
very
flavorful
for
a
pilsner
truly
a
great
pilsner
if
youre
into
hoppy
beers
personally
i
found
the
intensity
of
the
hops
and
floral
notes
offputting
and
not
really
justified
by
the
style
so
its
not
my
favorite
beer
but
if
thats
what
youre
into
by
all
means
have
a
few
prost
victory
prima
pils
45
id
say
it
should
be
considered
a
best
of
the
best
in
this
style
the
taste
begins
with
a
notable
grainy
malt
character
with
a
dry
yet
citruslike
bitterness
hanging
on
at
the
finish
really
clean
finish
too
overall
an
outstanding
german
pils
although
i
must
admit
to
a
sweet
spot
in
my
heart
for
this
style
this
one
is
an
exceptional
example
that
hits
all
the
notes
one
would
expect
from
a
worldclass
lager
i
wish
there
were
a
local
option
in
this
style
as
good
as
this
one
for
me
to
support
this
is
my
favorite
offering
from
the
short
list
of
victory
brews
ive
had
to
date
o
great
great
pilsener
definitely
world
class
overhopped
and
fantastic
the
aroma
is
definitely
more
interesting
bringing
some
toasty
tones
as
well
as
the
taste
the
hop
presence
is
relatively
to
the
style
shy
in
the
beginning
but
at
the
end
they
show
up
with
vigor
this
is
a
good
german
pilsener
pretty
perfect
for
new
england
summers
but
light
and
i
could
enjoy
it
everytime
i
drink
beer
reviewed
again
march
2015
fresher
crisper
aroma
and
flavor
while
still
maintaining
the
strong
hope
flavor
reminiscent
of
german
pilsners
but
with
an
american
twist
better
than
i
recall
remember
perhaps
the
best
germanstyle
pilsner
in
america
this
is
one
of
the
most
highly
regarded
american
made
pilsners
out
there
im
doing
a
rereview
of
this
one
ive
revisited
this
beer
23
times
over
the
last
year
and
although
my
pallet
is
more
tolerable
of
hop
bombed
double
ipas
and
such
it
has
lost
its
tolerance
for
this
overhopped
and
bitter
pilsner
i
just
dont
find
this
beer
refreshing
nor
easy
to
drink
both
of
which
is
a
mandatory
requirement
imo
for
this
style
of
beer
i
still
respect
it
to
some
regards
but
there
are
several
other
pilsners
now
that
i
would
prefer
over
this
hop
bombed
pils
o
not
bad
but
im
not
crazy
about
it
really
not
a
beer
i
would
go
for
again
unless
im
stuck
between
this
and
a
bunch
of
pas
and
ipas
i
have
recommended
this
to
a
few
die
hard
pale
ale
friends
because
it
is
a
little
more
refreshing
and
they
all
keep
it
in
the
fridge
now
d
drinkable
and
not
too
filling
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
it
looks
like
the
internet
suggests
that
this
gem
has
an
ibu
in
the
lowtomid
forties
this
is
not
unlike
hoppier
german
pilseners
from
germany
such
as
jever
waldhaus
alpirsbacher
or
rothaus
rothaus
pils
tannenzäpfle
is
one
of
my
favorite
alltime
beers
so
that
this
beer
comes
close
is
extremely
exciting
a
fantastic
brew
and
one
i
am
planning
on
buying
in
greater
quantities
highly
recommended
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
it
is
crisp
snappy
and
refreshing
worth
checking
out
but
there
are
other
examples
in
the
style
i
would
choose
over
this
one
if
given
the
opportunity
prime
example
being
any
of
victorys
braumeister
pils
offerings
o
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
and
something
i
love
to
have
with
food
it
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
not
too
heavy
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
european
pilsners
but
without
the
skunkiness
and
corn
flavors
that
you
usually
find
in
those
i
bet
much
of
that
has
to
do
with
it
being
an
american
brew
and
can
find
it
very
fresh
i
wish
more
places
had
this
on
tap
so
maybe
bud
drinkers
would
give
it
a
shot
the
victory
prima
pils
is
the
perfect
pilsner
it
has
a
great
full
bodied
pilsner
taste
with
a
load
of
hops
to
make
this
a
dynamic
taste
experience
it
poured
a
light
golden
color
with
a
full
creamy
head
the
first
taste
was
reminiscent
of
many
of
the
hoppy
ipas
i
have
been
having
lately
but
there
is
enough
of
the
signature
german
pilsner
flavor
to
keep
it
well
within
the
style
i
had
this
on
a
hot
afternoon
and
it
was
light
enough
to
tame
the
heat
and
the
dynamic
hoppy
bitterness
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
overall
a
great
pilsner
with
tremendous
flavor
without
any
odd
aftertaste
like
some
skunky
beers
have
great
beer
not
overpowering
golden
appearance
with
a
clean
finish
and
very
refreshing
definitely
not
too
sweetnot
too
much
alcohol
content
the
hops
are
just
right
present
but
not
overpowering
the
mouthfeel
is
extraordinary
big
clear
crisp
carbonation
that
isnt
fizzy
and
feels
just
right
i
could
see
this
being
one
of
my
standards
especially
in
the
summer
one
of
my
favorite
beers
paired
this
with
camembert
fontina
and
gouda
really
nice
for
end
of
summer
absolutely
refreshing
straightforward
with
an
edge
of
orange
really
outstanding
with
the
creamy
camembert
would
recommend
as
a
standalone
or
accompaniment
to
a
sophisticated
dinner
first
course
o
a
refreshing
beer
that
is
extremely
drinkable
and
does
what
it
sets
out
to
do
quite
well
o
my
review
may
not
seem
to
show
how
much
i
enjoy
this
pilsener
it
is
a
very
nice
take
on
the
style
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
when
the
temps
soared
into
the
90s
and
i
was
happy
to
have
it
to
drink
o
extremely
drinkable
beer
yet
there
is
nothing
that
blows
me
away
ill
admit
however
that
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
lighter
lagers
like
this
but
it
does
what
its
supposed
to
do
very
well
o
im
an
ipa
guy
but
i
used
to
be
a
pilsner
guy
who
thought
amstel
was
good
that
being
said
this
is
possibly
the
best
pilsner
out
there
really
well
done
drinkability
so
far
my
favorite
of
the
style
oanother
win
for
victory
this
stuff
is
1
excellent
for
its
style
and
2
just
freaking
excellent
regardless
of
style
overall
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
have
tried
that
being
said
i
havent
had
a
lot
im
fairly
new
to
the
lager
scene
in
general
that
being
said
this
will
easily
always
have
a
spot
in
my
fridge
finally
got
around
to
trying
this
wellrenowned
brew
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
aroma
is
very
fresh
spicy
and
hoppy
the
taste
of
noble
hops
is
really
the
first
thing
that
hits
you
upon
first
sip
slightly
spicypiney
a
little
bit
of
malt
just
really
wellbalanced
and
solid
very
easy
to
drink
a
nice
crisp
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
or
an
early
fall
night
this
beer
was
not
undrinkable
but
very
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
i
didnt
hate
it
but
i
would
not
but
it
again
if
you
like
ipas
this
might
be
up
your
alley
this
beer
is
to
pilsner
what
ipa
is
to
pale
ale
i
didnt
get
enough
balance
of
malt
in
fact
the
hops
kind
of
drowned
out
the
flavors
of
the
pilsner
malts
in
this
one
the
final
reason
i
didnt
rate
this
beer
higher
was
the
abv
pilsner
is
a
summer
beer
and
i
prefer
a
lower
alcohol
pilsner
overall
admittedly
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
pilsner
style
but
if
i
could
get
more
that
tasted
like
this
my
opinion
could
change
in
a
hurry
i
could
drink
this
all
day
o
one
of
the
best
american
brewed
german
pilseners
out
there
and
a
favorite
of
mine
a
very
nice
example
of
an
american
take
on
the
german
pilsner
style
delicious
refreshing
and
not
expensive
would
recommend
to
anyone
who
wants
a
good
easy
to
find
lager
o
the
pilsner
style
can
be
known
for
its
sharp
herbal
hop
bitterness
but
this
one
pushes
the
envelope
further
than
most
not
sure
what
were
looking
at
for
ibus
but
the
perceived
bitterness
is
very
high
this
is
easily
the
biggest
boldest
pilsner
ive
come
across
discounting
some
ridiculous
imperial
pilsners
its
damn
tasty
and
the
bite
really
wakes
up
the
drinker
like
in
old
movies
when
someone
smacks
a
hysterical
person
in
the
face
and
yells
snap
out
of
it
thanks
overall
this
one
is
up
there
on
my
list
and
im
not
a
pils
drinker
this
will
be
my
go
to
for
grilling
from
now
on
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
but
with
lots
of
character
i
thought
sam
adams
noble
pils
was
as
good
as
it
got
it
was
wrong
by
miles
and
miles
my
alltime
favorite
pils
an
admittedly
short
list
but
this
is
my
american
champ
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
look
and
aroma
are
classic
pilsner
golden
straw
color
with
bright
fresh
smell
taste
is
classic
pils
as
well
very
balanced
not
too
dry
not
too
crisp
not
too
hoppy
etc
doesnt
break
the
mold
but
rather
perfectly
recreates
a
classic
pilsner
experience
o
this
compares
favorably
against
the
best
pilseners
ive
ever
tasted
granted
my
experience
is
limited
at
this
point
but
i
see
this
being
among
my
favorites
for
a
long
time
to
come
beer
is
of
medium
weight
with
low
to
mediumlow
levels
of
carbonation
leading
to
a
beer
that
softly
gradually
foams
up
on
the
palate
then
quickly
settles
to
a
smooth
and
slightly
placid
existence
as
it
moves
across
the
tongue
never
watery
but
a
bit
more
carbonation
would
suit
this
beer
nicely
closes
very
dry
with
light
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
taste
similar
to
a
porter
with
159
calories
per
bottle
at
5
3
abv
not
a
fan
of
this
similar
porter
style
taste
the
aftertaste
is
strongbold
a
bit
better
than
the
average
you
can
taste
the
hops
and
malt
strong
and
it
has
the
heavy
feel
of
a
guinness
with
less
calories
this
pilsner
is
good
but
not
for
me
o
im
a
huge
pilsener
and
lager
fan
and
this
is
up
there
with
the
best
ive
sampled
so
much
flavor
going
on
for
a
pilsener
yet
still
sessionable
and
easy
on
the
throat
and
stomach
highly
recommend
this
brew
to
any
pilsenerlager
fans
or
anyone
that
is
looking
for
an
easy
drinking
beer
with
lots
of
great
flavor
a
hoppy
pilsner
with
character
and
superb
flavor
in
my
opinion
superior
to
most
german
and
czech
pilsners
far
from
boring
which
is
generally
a
challenge
for
pilsners
actually
i
dont
remember
having
a
better
pilsner
highly
recommendable
not
sure
maybe
a
bad
or
old
bottle
perhaps
worth
another
try
one
of
victorys
best
a
great
hoppy
lager
cheers
not
a
super
interesting
beer
but
its
above
average
for
a
pilsener
im
not
nearly
as
high
on
this
beer
as
the
majority
of
reviewers
but
its
still
well
worth
trying
out
o
for
a
pilsner
for
which
i
rarely
drink
i
enjoyed
this
beer
immensely
another
great
job
by
victory
a
well
made
pils
with
a
lot
of
balance
between
all
elements
with
hoppiness
matching
of
exceeding
the
classic
fresh
style
a
very
positive
experienceone
of
the
better
pilsners
in
my
memory
o
what
an
amazing
pilsner
and
this
is
coming
from
a
guy
whos
iffy
on
the
style
pours
straw
gold
with
an
orange
undertone
slight
citrus
nose
little
yeast
with
a
respectable
bit
of
malt
behind
it
some
haze
looks
and
smells
delightful
i
did
not
pour
a
head
but
the
lacing
shows
good
retention
hugs
the
glass
like
its
in
love
the
taste
is
grassy
hops
with
a
distinct
oily
bitterness
good
malt
spine
medium
body
medium
carbonation
a
little
lemon
and
a
dry
finish
good
example
of
a
classic
pils
substantial
hops
engaging
aftertaste
overall
between
this
and
staropramen
from
prague
these
are
my
two
favorite
pilsners
they
do
the
style
right
and
have
the
flavor
and
fullness
that
the
american
macros
pretend
to
have
this
is
a
quality
session
beer
that
i
could
never
get
sick
of
also
enough
hops
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
a
hophead
like
myself
who
normally
doesnt
buy
pilsners
good
job
victory
o
this
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
a
little
hoppier
than
more
traditional
examples
which
is
what
makes
it
so
tasty
this
is
a
staple
in
my
fridge
during
the
summer
months
and
a
go
to
anytime
im
craving
a
nice
solid
pils
rjt
aroma
taste
had
a
nice
hoppy
nose
to
it
lots
of
herbs
hop
notes
had
a
bitter
dry
hoppy
finish
finished
quick
but
had
a
lingering
bitterness
to
it
slight
note
of
honey
that
i
really
enjoyed
the
prima
pils
from
victory
brewing
company
was
a
pleasant
surprise
the
beer
had
a
light
yellow
appearance
it
had
a
smell
full
of
hops
and
floral
notes
the
beer
had
a
lighter
body
mouth
feel
the
taste
was
light
and
earthy
with
hints
of
hops
this
was
a
very
nice
pilsner
the
victory
prima
had
an
appearance
of
yellow
coloring
and
smelled
of
citrus
and
freshness
which
i
liked
in
a
beer
however
when
i
tried
it
i
thought
it
tasted
very
bitter
and
hoppy
although
i
did
like
the
freshness
and
after
taste
once
you
tasted
the
beer
m
perfect
for
style
not
too
thick
but
still
foodlike
leaving
a
lingering
taste
this
is
just
too
grassy
and
bitter
chlorophyll
comes
to
mind
great
beer
and
reasonably
affordable
too
o
pretty
much
flawless
for
the
style
as
far
as
im
concerned
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
14
oz
pint
glass
pours
a
straw
yellow
that
is
semitranslucent
and
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
sweet
barley
and
slight
floral
aroma
tastes
of
light
grain
body
with
slight
floral
hop
bite
this
beer
is
carbonated
heavily
but
not
overly
so
and
goes
down
very
smoothly
with
its
light
body
overall
a
superb
beer
a
wonderful
anytime
beer
and
a
more
heavily
hopped
pilsner
good
drinkin
o
i
cant
be
too
stylespecific
here
outside
of
my
own
expectations
for
the
style
as
this
is
the
only
german
pilsener
ive
ever
had
as
a
beer
in
general
i
found
it
to
be
quite
refreshing
crisp
and
drinkable
o
im
an
ipa
lover
but
i
could
learn
to
love
this
pils
isnt
too
far
from
an
ipa
no
more
bad
beer
victory
for
all
victory
victory
o
very
flavorful
and
clean
will
be
great
in
the
summer
this
beer
makes
me
really
excited
for
the
craft
pils
scene
which
i
havent
really
explored
a
lot
victory
is
doing
some
good
things
and
im
glad
i
live
nearby
to
experience
it
o
a
definite
musttry
for
anyone
cant
wait
to
have
it
again
i
remember
first
getting
into
craft
beer
the
hop
shiv
that
you
get
thrust
into
your
mouth
right
away
on
this
one
was
offputting
almost
like
a
lighter
ipa
on
the
palate
not
a
whole
lot
of
malt
going
on
here
but
its
crisp
dry
and
all
about
the
bitter
citrus
bite
love
it
love
this
beer
probably
my
favorite
pilsner
deep
flavor
with
a
great
finish
my
only
down
is
its
smell
is
not
real
strong
then
again
im
really
an
ipa
guy
so
i
like
the
strong
bite
of
good
hops
but
this
beer
is
really
good
on
a
fresh
pour
co2
rolls
like
a
new
england
snowstorm
and
holds
a
nice
firm
foam
head
it
pours
a
darker
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
head
retention
is
good
and
the
lacing
is
nice
to
look
at
it
smells
very
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
which
is
no
problem
for
me
some
citrus
and
floral
notes
are
detectable
the
taste
shows
some
light
malt
up
front
with
lemon
peel
but
then
a
sharp
hoppy
bitterness
takes
over
it
has
a
light
crisp
mouthfeel
with
aggressive
carbonation
its
light
and
refreshing
feel
crisp
medium
body
with
light
carbonation
finish
is
very
long
and
dry
12
ounce
bottle
into

pours
fairly
crystal
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
dense
white
head
with
fantastic
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lasts
nice
soapy
lacing
clings
down
the
glass
with
some
light
streaming
carbonation
aromas
of
lemon
pear
apple
floral
grass
cracker
pepper
light
pine
and
herbal
earthiness
very
nice

with
a
good

taste
of
big
lemon
orange

lingering
notes
of

light
fruits
floral
pepper
grass
cracker
bread
hop
earthiness
and
floral
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a
good
bit
damn
nice
flavor
balance
with
good
complexity
with
a
very
hoppy
flavor
profile
and
nearly
zero
cloying
flavors
present
after
the
finish
medium
carbonation
and
body
with
a
very
smooth
crisp
and
sticky
mouthfeel
that
is
nice
alcohol
is
very
well
hidden
with
hardly
any
warming
noticed
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pilsner
style
great
hoppy
flavor
balance
with
good
complexity
and
extremely
smooth
and
crisp
to
drink
a
very
enjoyable
offering
as
expected
as
good
as
it
is
it
still
doesnt
blow
my
mind
i
dont
really
have
it
miles
ahead
of
other
pilsners
like
other
reviewers
have
still
highly
recommended
though
ontap
its
quite
delicious
just
as
it
was
in
the
bottles
overall
i
maybe
shouldnt
have
tasted
this
before
work
the
hops
really
stick
around
its
tasty
but
i
think
that
lagunitas
does
a
better
hoppy
pils
with
more
booze
and
over
all
i
really
like
the
oskar
blues
little
yellow
pils
but
this
one
sure
seems
authentic
and
is
a
definite
contender
notes
this
beer
follows
the
style
guide
very
well
and
so
i
score
it
high
accordingly
but
i
guess
pils
just
isnt
my
thing
the
bitterness
makes
it
difficult
to
enjoy
the
other
flavors
high
b
thin
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
sticky
hop
texture
very
active
carbonation
and
a
strong
hoppy
finish
strong
hop
presence
in
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
citrus
and
pine
character
throughout
the
wellbalanced
malt
component
provides
a
nice
sweet
counterpoint
to
the
hop
bitterness
plus
adds
some
smoothness
to
the
overall
feel
fresh
and
alluring
from
the
get
go
oits
january
but
the
sun
is
out
so
i
figured
i
would
break
up
the
stoutstrong
ale
parade
with
a
pils
and
this
was
a
good
choice
it
wasnt
the
best
beer
i
have
tasted
probably
not
even
close
to
the
best
pils
i
have
tasted
but
the
little
hoppy
kick
keeps
this
from
feeling
like
just
another
light
fizzy
beer
i
would
reach
for
this
again
as
the
weather
warms
or
anytime
i
need
a
break
from
the
stronger
brews
that
i
tend
to
gravitate
towards
overall
easy
drinking
but
flavourful
i
am
not
a
pilsner
fan
and
my
score
probably
reflects
that
but
this
strikes
me
as
quite
a
good
presentation
of
the
style
best
example
of
a
pilsner
ive
had
in
a
while
though
the
hops
are
over
the
top
but
thats
good
for
my
personal
preference
burst
of
spicyherbal
hops
up
front
but
its
not
overwhelming
sweet
pale
malts
bready
biscuity
a
little
grassy
finish
is
peppery
crisp
semidry
body
is
light
very
refreshing
lively
carbonated
highly
drinkable
pours
light
gold
color
with
a
very
slight
haze
and
a
head
with
rather
large
bubbles
strong
earthy
spicy
hops
and
distinct
bread
crust
in
the
aroma
the
hops
dominate
the
flavor
profile
with
a
very
light
honey
sweetness
and
bread
flavor
from
the
malt
finishes
dry
and
bitter
with
plenty
of
earthy
spicy
hops
light
bodied
with
carbonation
on
the
loose
side
o
a
good
pils
very
good
example
of
the
style
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
option
fantastic
german
pilsner
thats
flavorful
while
being
well
balanced
and
soooo
drinkable
it
was
a
nice
surprise
great
beer
by
victory
i
love
the
nose
and
love
the
hoopiness
of
this
beer
o
damn
what
a
pils
definitely
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
brewed
in
the
states
very
easy
to
drink
and
put
down
a
sixer
of
great
price
point
as
well
highly
recommended
this
one
surprised
me
i
didnt
expect
this
one
to
be
as
good
as
it
was
poured
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pilsner
flute
it
appears
a
pale
and
hazy
straw
with
a
nice
head
excellent
retention
and
elaborate
lacing
the
nose
is
very
subtle
but
it
is
very
floral
and
nice
taste
is
nice
with
an
initial
neutral
taste
not
too
sweet
not
to
bitter
but
finishes
with
an
assertive
bitterness
leaving
a
fairly
nice
aftertaste
recommended
o
a
great
wellrounded
pilsener
with
some
big
hop
presence
while
also
retaining
the
crisp
refreshing
feel
of
a
pils
lager
overall
a
truly
epic
lager
an
absolutely
huge
noble
hop
character
that
has
gone
unrivaled
by
anything
past
my
taste
buds
the
balance
is
way
off
and
many
will
find
it
offputting
but
if
hops
and
sessionability
are
what
you
want
then
this
will
do
the
trick
it
makes
an
excellent
change
of
flavor
for
any
of
you
who
want
an
overly
hopped
beer
that
has
a
totally
unique
character
overall
wasnt
sure
what
to
think
of
it
the
first
few
sips
but
as
it
warmed
it
really
grew
on
me
great
representation
of
the
style
reminiscent
of
the
rogue
uber
pils
that
seems
to
have
gone
the
way
of
the
dodo
im
obviously
not
a
pils
guy
but
this
ones
not
too
bad
and
its
seen
quite
often
in
bottles
and
on
tap
clear
goldenyellow
pour
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
recedes
to
a
thin
layer
leaving
a
bit
of
lacing
behind
floral
hops
on
the
nose
grainy
no
surprises
here
taste
of
pils
malts
grains
biscuity
light
and
crisp
floral
hops
with
a
touch
of
citrus
zest
fairly
bitter
and
drying
light
body
pretty
easily
drinkable
for
the
style
but
overall
just
not
my
thing
a
great
year
round
beer
and
an
excellent
pilsner
overall
a
nicely
balanced
refreshing
brew
on
the
hoppy
side
for
a
pilsner
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
comparable
to
a
malty
american
pale
ale
an
asset
to
the
style
final
thoughts
the
overall
smoothness
of
this
beer
caught
me
by
surprise
bmc
beers
tend
to
give
pilseners
a
bad
name
but
prima
pils
definitely
restores
that
style
to
how
it
aught
to
be
considered
would
i
drink
it
again
its
likely
at
5
3
abv
its
even
sessionable
a
light
copper
colored
and
well
carbonated
brew
prima
pils
has
a
wonderful
hop
aroma
very
enticing
the
hops
flavors
are
very
noticeable
and
at
the
forefront
of
this
beer
i
think
that
this
beer
is
almost
too
carbonated
which
detracts
from
the
mouth
feel
in
my
opinion
for
this
style
i
would
appreciate
a
little
less
carbonation
in
order
for
the
beer
to
flow
more
smoothly
a
crisp
dry
finish
makes
the
perfect
end
for
this
brew
overall
a
nice
refreshing
bitter
beer
due
to
the
hops
usage
here
i
suspect
if
i
try
every
other
example
of
this
style
id
still
come
back
to
this
one
as
my
tops
rich
for
what
it
is
and
excellent
great
beer
for
the
style
nice
crisp
and
bitter
perfect
for
watching
some
college
football
after
mowing
the
grass
overall
an
enjoyable
pilsner
prima
pils
is
a
very
tasty
thin
bodied
beer
this
could
be
drank
all
day
long
and
would
go
great
with
some
spicy
buffalo
wings
ill
drink
more
of
this
pours
a
mostly
clear
goldenrod
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
scent
is
mild
with
hops
wheat
yeast
and
hints
of
citrus
the
taste
is
initially
a
sweet
wheat
tone
that
turns
wet
and
slightly
dry
on
the
palette
texture
is
smooth
and
refreshing
as
the
beer
is
fairly
complex
for
a
pilsner
leaves
a
slight
chalky
after
taste
not
bad
at
all
victory
brewing
makes
many
fine
products
and
prima
pils
is
one
of
the
finest
i
find
myself
sipping
evaluating
and
continuing
to
find
more
and
more
complex
flavors
everything
from
the
initial
sip
through
the
aftertaste
is
memorable
and
quite
remarkable
try
a
prima
pils
for
yourself
and
see
what
you
think
this
is
hands
down
the
best
german
pilsner
in
the
business
a
wonderful
clean
and
refreshing
brew
that
can
be
drunk
all
day
and
a
great
pairing
for
many
types
of
food
the
hotter
it
gets
outside
the
better
the
beer
tastes
gong
down
although
victory
makes
many
great
brews
this
is
their
flagship
brew
in
my
opinion
in
my
opinion
the
best
session
beer
out
there
mouthfeel
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
pours
a
slightly
clouded
straw
gold
with
minimal
head
that
falls
to
nothing
nose
is
a
matured
and
subdued
lemon
flavor
is
slightly
citrus
like
with
a
smooth
and
slightly
heavily
bodied
character
that
comes
off
as
earthy
and
leaves
a
high
amount
of
ink
in
the
mouth
consistent
flavor
delivery
never
drops
off
just
fades
away
over
time
very
drinkable
though
might
be
a
bit
too
hearty
for
some
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
medium
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
scent
is
grassy
with
a
hint
of
lemon
at
first
a
good
amount
of
hops
for
a
pilsner
slight
german
malt
aroma
a
bit
of
grain
as
well
nice
smell
for
a
pilsner
taste
is
very
lemony
at
first
with
some
subtle
hoppiness
which
immediately
turns
to
a
good
amount
of
hoppiness
grassy
hops
with
some
nice
german
malt
flavor
with
crisp
earthy
flavors
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
very
high
overall
this
is
very
tasty
for
this
style
not
my
particularly
favorite
style
but
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
when
it
comes
to
this
genre
overall
a
really
really
enjoyable
pilsner
will
get
this
again
o
just
about
the
finest
domestic
example
of
an
german
pilsner
ive
come
across
its
got
the
assertive
hoppiness
i
enjoy
and
its
light
enough
to
drink
in
quantity
well
done
victory
a
nice
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
pilsner
from
victory
they
have
done
a
good
job
staying
true
to
the
traditional
pilsner
style
while
putting
their
own
tweak
on
it
giving
it
a
little
bit
more
of
a
kick
the
beer
seeming
a
bit
more
robust
than
a
traditional
germanstyle
pilsner
which
is
what
they
seem
to
be
trying
to
emulate
well
done
final
words
try
this
beer
if
you
like
ipas
you
may
just
find
the
lager
youve
been
looking
for
you
get
the
hoppiness
of
a
good
ipa
with
the
great
head
of
a
true
pils
taken
in
this
regard
youll
find
much
to
enjoy
just
dont
judge
it
as
a
pils
overall
for
its
style
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
victory
really
can
hang
with
any
german
brewery
on
this
one
i
will
buy
it
again
this
is
a
really
nice
pilsener
i
would
buy
again
when
i
wanted
a
fuller
than
normal
experience
overall
a
refreshing
and
delicious
if
over
hopped
pilsner

o
excellent
american
take
on
a
pilsner
this
is
one
of
my
summer
go
too
beers
it
is
just
flavorful
and
refreshing
a
good
times
kind
of
lager
really
very
good
i
went
into
the
liquor
store
yesterday
choice
mart
on
mass
ave
and
spent
some
time
perusing
their
selection
dece
for
a
liquor
store
in
the
end
i
came
away
with
a
sixer
of
prima
nothing
exotic
just
hits
the
spot
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
was
an
ok
beer
nothing
special
i
dont
think
ill
buy
this
beer
again
its
a
little
too
bitter
and
not
refreshing
enough
for
me
to
warrant
keeping
this
around
taste
similar
to
smell
with
lots
of
grapefruit
tastes
like
an
ipa
lager
wonderful
does
it
get
any
better
than
this
this
is
a
classic
its
grassy
and
yet
i
like
it
it
works
well
with
the
grainy
malt
profile
and
the
slightly
spicy
lager
yeast
ive
had
this
a
lot
and
i
plan
to
continue
drinking
it
in
the
future
originally
reviewed

thank
god
d
c
is
close
enough
to
dutch
country
all
hail
the
greatest
beer
in
america
overall
a
very
refreshing
and
flavorful
pilsner
light
and
refreshing
yet
flavorful
my
new
go
to
pilsner
pairs
well
with
some
food
or
on
its
own
on
a
hot
summer
day
we
have
plenty
of
those
here
in
miami
o
one
of
the
most
masterful
pilsners
i
have
tried
so
far
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
o
this
is
a
pilsner
that
makes
you
stop
to
think
about
what
youre
drinking
its
not
as
chuggable
as
others
but
its
much
bigger
than
the
average
pils
oh
yeah
i
like
this
one
a
lot
so
much
so
that
i
bought
a
case
of
the
stuff
overall
i
could
drink
this
day
in
and
day
out
if
i
had
a
hankering
for
a
lager
it
hits
the
spot
and
thats
all
i
can
ask
for
damn
fine
take
ov
tasty
and
hoppy
the
alcohol
doesnt
over
power
and
the
bitterness
isnt
as
potent
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
if
you
are
not
a
true
hop
head
good
transition
beer
overall
a
very
good
pilsener
i
enjoy
the
hops
it
brings
to
the
table
can
see
how
its
not
for
everyone
but
a
refreshing
hop
dose
without
diving
into
an
ipa
overall
i
want
to
have
this
again
but
on
draught
very
clean
and
smooth
tasting
with
the
typical
true
pilsner
aftertaste
starts
sweet
and
bready
finishes
dry
and
bitter
this
beer
did
not
really
stick
out
for
me
but
looking
at
the
reviews
a
lot
of
people
really
enjoyed
it
floral
bready
aroma
similar
in
the
flavor
refreshing
and
crisp
but
not
thin
or
overcarbed
unexpectedly
high
bitterness
is
delicious
and
smooth
and
lingers
pleasantly
only
criticism
might
be
that
the
level
of
hop
flavor
verges
on
soapiness
but
it
is
still
better
than
the
typical
lack
of
flavor
you
expect
in
a
pils
nice
drink
prima
pils
lives
up
to
the
hype
stock
up
and
enjoy
it
often
a
tap
selection
at
the
linkery
in
san
diego
a
thoroughly
drinkable
hoppy
beer
but
quite
focused
and
even
intense
the
dissenter
in
our
group
thought
it
taste
of
comet
cleanser
o
great
beer
awesome
flavor
needs
a
touch
more
carbonation
and
it
would
be
my
favorite
pils
but
for
now
the
noble
pils
wins
possibly
my
favorite
domestic
pilsner
and
one
of
my
favorite
domestic
lagers
one
of
the
best
finishing
beers
ive
ever
had
great
stuff

wow
this
really
is
an
amazing
beer
it
is
extremely
refreshing
and
an
awesome
thirst
quencher
the
bitterness
might
be
a
little
high
for
a
pilsener
but
it
works
very
well
in
this
beer
this
will
become
a
regular
in
my
fridge
o
pleasant
maybe
a
go
to
beer
in
the
summer
but
i
cant
see
myself
searching
it
out
again
as
far
as
the
style
goes
its
easily
the
best
ive
had
o
this
is
not
a
style
i
traditionally
enjoy
but
this
is
the
best
i
have
ha
in
the
class
i
can
easily
see
what
the
hype
is
about
and
certainly
would
not
turn
one
down
o
i
like
enough
to
make
it
part
of
my
beer
rotation
its
refreshing
has
a
lowish
abv
but
also
has
a
lot
of
flavor
especially
the
bright
lemon
citrus
and
dry
spicy
finish
bolder
than
a
sierra
nevada
pale
ale
another
one
in
my
regular
rotation
but
not
quite
as
well
balanced
i
like
this
better
than
the
sierra
nevada
summerfest
or
the
stoudts
pils
after
tasting
them
sidebyside
also
while
this
has
a
1
higher
abv
than
my
1
session
beer
21st
amendments
bitter
american
as
of
late
this
is
capturing
a
bigger
portion
of
my
beer
budget
than
in
previous
years
really
good
stuff
o
goes
down
easy
with
plenty
of
flavor
but
id
like
a
little
more
malt
balance
a
good
fit
for
a
hot
springsummer
afternoon
though
probably
not
a
beer
id
buy
often
a
nice
distinct
pilsner
i
have
had
a
few
in
recent
days
and
this
one
definitely
tastes
different
i
can
see
why
its
rated
so
highly
in
its
category
i
wish
i
could
taste
just
a
bit
more
of
the
malt
and
was
just
a
bit
more
carbonated
but
that
is
my
only
gripe
here
it
is
obvious
this
isnt
going
to
be
a
true
to
form
pilsner
the
packaging
shows
you
this
o
awesome
pilsner
brew
from
victory
the
beer
is
very
refreshing
drinkable
and
flavorful
without
any
hints
of
skunk
highly
recommended
overall
very
refreshing
with
flavor
more
robust
than
many
others
in
the
genre
this
german
pilsner
pours
a
brilliant
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
provides
plenty
of
lacing
grainy
pils
malt
lemon
and
some
floral
and
spicy
hop
character
forms
a
very
appealing
bouquet
of
aromas
bready
malt
and
some
sweetness
blends
beautifully
into
crisp
hop
bitterness
with
some
lemon
and
honey
detected
as
well
crisp
and
clean
this
amazing
pils
is
lighter
in
body
and
features
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
o
a
great
pilsner
that
is
highly
drinkable
sometimes
this
is
not
the
most
interesting
style
but
this
is
just
a
great
everyday
beer
i
wonder
how
id
feel
if
this
beer
went
by
a
different
name
maybe
just
victory
prima
perhaps
id
be
more
open
to
liking
it
but
as
its
currently
named
and
marketed
its
a
bastardization
of
the
style
d
goes
down
better
than
most
beer
isnt
overly
rich
at
all
and
would
make
a
great
temporary
friend
on
a
hot
day
oone
of
the
best
pilseners
ive
had
it
has
a
nice
touch
of
bitterness
that
most
seem
to
be
lacking
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
in
a
style
where
the
brews
can
tend
to
run
together
the
slight
extra
hop
character
really
makes
this
stand
out
and
the
drinkability
would
keep
me
coming
back
if
i
had
regular
access
overall
a
fine
example
of
a
pilsener
if
only
budweiser
drinkers
knew
what
they
were
missing
o
drinkability
is
very
good
overall
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
great
example
of
the
style
floral
hops
dominate
with
grainy
malt
undertones
crisp
and
refreshing
were
very
fortunate
to
have
such
a
high
quality
german
pilsner
available
fresh
on
the
east
coast
o
this
is
a
great
beer
for
the
style
and
nice
because
a
little
bit
more
of
the
hoppiness
comes
through
than
some
others
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
and
will
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
im
going
to
have
to
go
pick
me
up
some
more
of
this
at
some
point
soon
poured
into
a
13
oz
tulip
glass
best

2012
pours
a
straw
yellow
with
a
two
inch
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
lace
everywhere
smell
is
grass
biscuit
pepper
and
citrus
taste
is
all
those
things
with
a
peppery
grass
beginning
and
actually
a
hit
of
lemon
in
the
finish
taste
is
way
more
aggressive
than
the
smell
body
is
medium
for
the
style
plenty
of
life
a
little
dry
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
but
didnt
live
up
to
my
very
high
expectations
a
good
bottle
to
crack
open
if
someone
wanted
something
a
bit
hoppy
but
also
on
the
lighter
side
lightbodied
fizzy
and
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
crisp
just
a
little
creamy
this
is
pretty
much
as
good
as
people
will
generally
tell
you
it
is
the
embodiment
of
summer
you
shuck
some
oysters
ill
go
buy
some
more
o
this
is
a
very
well
made
pilsner
targeted
at
people
who
appreciate
hop
bitterness
the
other
elements
of
the
beer
are
lovely
i
think
this
beer
would
be
fantastic
without
so
much
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
swallow
just
a
bit
more
balance
the
bitterness
does
give
it
some
identity
but
i
dont
think
it
would
blend
in
with
every
other
pilsner
if
it
lacked
it
its
floral
nature
and
accompanying
sweetness
are
bewitching
all
by
themselves
id
give
it
a
4
5
on
taste
if
it
werent
for
the
overbitterness
so
instead
its
a
4
id
give
it
a
4
5
overall
if
not
for
the
bitterness
so
instead
its
a
4
clearly
this
is
subjective
to
a
nonhopper
overall
this
is
a
really
nice
pils
light
and
easy
to
drink
im
a
big
fan
o
mmm
ive
missed
you
old
friend
this
used
to
be
a
staple
of
mine
so
crisp
and
refreshing
just
make
sure
you
get
a
fresh
bottle
prima
pils
pours
perfect
golden
light
yellow
with
a
great
offwhite
head
plenty
of
hops
thoughout
the
nose
and
with
each
sip
super
dry
and
crisp
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
hop
zip
it
is
such
a
great
thirst
quencher
a
great
apertif
a
great
beer
period
jever
was
the
inspriation
for
this
beer
and
it
shows
jever
would
be
proud
smooth
fullbodied
for
the
style
with
a
gentle
flowing
effervescence
that
doesnt
take
away
from
the
flavor
it
enhances
it
if
millbudcoors
could
make
a
beer
taste
this
good
instead
of
the
bitter
dreck
they
currently
make
id
drink
it
great
pilsner
even
being
past
the
best
by
date
its
some
good
swill
this
is
a
very
bold
and
flavorful
german
style
pils
lots
of
hops
throughout
the
flavor
and
aroma
and
quite
bitter
decadent
for
the
style
even
but
very
good
probably
more
of
a
hopheads
pils
rather
than
an
every
mans
pils
very
well
crafted
and
tasty
poured
into
a
gulden
draak
tulip
pours
a
hazy
light
orangeyellow
amber
half
finger
fine
white
head
with
moderate
retention
and
lacing
light
aroma
of
sweet
malt
hay
faint
hops
taste
is
sweet
malt
a
hint
of
citrus
dry
grassy
flavor
blends
nicely
into
a
hoppy
finish
leaving
a
pleasant
hoppy
malt
aftertaste
medium
bodied
not
very
complex
but
nice
flavor
progression
and
integration
a
very
nicely
done
pilsner
o
if
youve
read
this
far
you
wont
be
surprised
to
find
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
good
color
the
aromas
were
enticing
and
the
taste
was
quite
good
with
wellbalanced
flavors
mouthfeel
was
on
point
and
this
is
one
that
you
can
enjoy
with
a
multitude
of
activities
its
really
good
with
fried
chicken
by
the
way
cheers
unfortunately
though
the
beer
just
kind
of
drinks
like
a
hopped
up
light
beer
light
and
fizzy
with
a
big
bitter
finish
the
lack
of
any
sort
of
balance
ruins
the
drinkability
that
a
pilsner
should
have
good
if
your
hop
lover
but
not
as
good
as
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
interesting
not
as
quaffable
as
other
pilseners
but
certainly
lively
light
body
moderately
carbonated
the
finish
is
pretty
pretty
dry
this
is
not
a
slave
to
its
style
and
definitely
shows
some
american
tendencies
perhaps
this
is
more
of
an
imperial
pilsner
an
awesome
beer
that
is
highly
drinkable
and
flavorful
overall
a
great
take
on
the
pilsner
style
probably
the
best
american
version
yet
full
malt
flavor
with
a
very
nice
backing
of
hops
first
of
all
this
is
not
a
german
pilsner
its
more
comparable
to
really
awful
american
ipa
really
damn
carbonated
and
looks
like
dehydrated
piss
with
seltzer
water
taste
was
a
watery
carbonated
bud
light
with
hops
and
the
combination
is
the
least
satisfying
definitely
letting
all
the
pros
that
rated
this
beer
so
highly
share
this
hillbilly
beer
to
their
families
because
i
will
definitely
not
be
o
really
good
refreshing
pilsner
cant
wait
to
drink
this
during
the
summertime
on
the
beach
a
session
beer
for
sure
reccommended
o
refreshing
and
crisp
easy
drinking
for
sure
a
great
pilsner
no
doubt
oan
excellent
brew
it
looks
and
tastes
great
very
easy
drinking
pils
overall
the
perfect
american
pils
if
not
pretty
damn
close
i
could
drink
this
any
time
any
occasion
this
is
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
in
a
long
time
unfortunately
im
not
a
big
fan
of
pilsners
in
general
still
very
nice
drinkability
refreshing
flavorful
session
brew
o
pretty
much
the
best
light
lager
i
have
ever
had
a
bit
hoppier
than
many
examples
of
the
style
but
incredibly
flavorful
and
amazingly
drinkable
o
this
beer
comes
together
nicely
the
individual
parts
however
are
not
so
great
apart
one
of
the
best
pilsners
there
is
if
only
all
beers
marketed
at
pilsner
tasted
like
this
this
is
an
excellent
take
on
the
style
i
would
have
expected
nothing
less
from
victory
this
one
would
convert
any
bmc
drinker
for
sure
i
like
it
because
once
youve
swallowed
it
has
created
a
wonderful
after
taste
yet
it
doesnt
have
a
heavy
mouthfeel
it
has
a
nice
clean
finish

very
solid
german
pils
but
not
my
favorite
o
a
very
tasty
and
well
balanced
beer
this
would
be
a
great
beer
to
quaff
on
a
summer
afternoon
more
hop
flavor
than
most
pilsners
something
i
enjoy
great
pils
one
of
the
best
craft
versions
on
the
market
very
nice
bready
aroma
and
flavor
and
wellbalanced
hops
create
an
almost
perfect
pilsner
good
head
and
lacing
with
great
overall
flavor
body
is
just
right
not
too
heavy
this
is
a
definite
go
too
beer
cheers
d
again
the
bitterness
is
really
heavy
but
overall
this
seems
to
be
a
pretty
crisp
clean
and
easy
drinking
pils
brilliant
straw
yellow
nice
tight
head
great
lacing
nose
is
an
awesome
mix
of
spiciness
on
the
hops
not
so
much
as
a
hint
of
diacetyl
taste
light
snappy
with
an
impossible
drinkability
a
relatively
small
beer
so
theres
nowhere
for
flaws
to
hide
fortunately
there
arent
any
o
beer
is
highly
to
style
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
that
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
overall
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
pilsner
style
as
it
seems
a
bit
boring
to
me
but
the
extra
hops
give
this
brew
more
character
and
enjoyment
very
well
done
o
4
o
man
is
this
a
good
one
great
representation
of
the
style
could
keep
on
drinking
this
one
all
night
notes
moderate
in
body
with
a
ton
of
flavor
balanced
and
extremely
clean
drinkability
is
superb
move
aside
germany
this
is
hands
down
one
of
the
finest
pilseners
on
the
planet
on
of
the
better
pilsners
that
i
have
ever
had
though
admittedly
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
taste
and
feels
amazing
i
think
they
should
have
an
american
pilsener
style
created
based
off
of
this
wonderful
take
on
the
central
european
classic
its
much
more
hopforward
with
a
crisp
bitterness
that
almost
steals
the
show
as
compared
to
german
or
czech
styles
so
fresh
feeling
lemonlike
acidity
and
citrus
combines
terrifically
with
the
crackerygrainbread
malt
malt
is
very
delicate
as
compared
to
bready
backbones
in
other
styles
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
this
is

it

and
a

5poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
wonderful
little
beer
with
a
nice
fluffy
head
and
light
yellow
appearance
aroma
of
the
hops
is
the
main
presents
taste
is
wonder
but
a
tad
bitter
for
me
this
is
another
top
notch
beer
from
the
people
at
victory
dodtsep

but
its
definitely
a
decent
beer
i
need
to
try
this
one
again
a
little
fresher
and
see
if
the
results
are
the
same

while
also
giving
a
clinic
on
noble
hop
flavors
and
aromas
while
authentic
its
still
one
of
the
best
german
style
pilsners
around

o
if
you
have
ever
been
scared
away
from
german
pilseners
or
pils
in
general
seek
this
one
out
you
will
be
quite
fond
as
i
was
great
beer
easily
the
best
ive
had
from
victory
at
my
stage
in
the
craft
beer
game
i
shouldve
tried
this
beer
a
long
time
ago
shame
on
me
for
taking
this
long
to
try
this
beer
this
is
definitely
in
my
top
two
favorite
pilseners
ive
had
to
date
maybe
the
best
it
doesnt
really
get
much
better
for
the
style
this
beer
is
an
eye
opener
recommended
to
anyone
light
to
medium
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
the
body
is
easydrinking
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
not
overly
apparent
but
just
enough
to
help
this
beers
drinkability
the
dryness
at
the
end
of
the
taste
beckons
another
sip
o
heres
the
deal
this
is
a
good
to
great
beer
for
the
style
i
would
come
back
to
this
day
in
and
day
out
for
a
drinkable
summer
beer
its
very
refreshing
however
in
the
grand
scheme
of
beers
this
is
more
on
the
good
level
absolutely
worth
a
try
though
still
its
a
nice
light
to
medium
bodied
beer
thats
one
of
the
tops
of
its
style
its
got
great
carbonation
and
it
came
from
my
mom
how
could
it
not
be
good
overall
only
picked
up
two
of
these
but
i
could
definitely
see
this
being
a
session
beer
only
other
pils
ive
ever
enjoyed
this
much
is
pilsner
urquell
miller
lite
should
be
banned
from
calling
their
beer
pilsner
another
solid
offering
from
victory
this
is
a
lighter
summerstyle
brew
that
doesnt
disappoint
superior
crisp
and
flavorful
the
beer
equivalent
of
biting
into
a
cold
apple
this
pilsner
boasts
lovely
light
grape
nuts
cereal
flavors
in
the
malt
and
a
neat
layer
of
light
grapefruit
hops
that
lingers
on
the
tongue
in
a
dry
finish
sugars
are
wellbalanced
and
emphasize
the
grain
flavors
rather
than
mask
them
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
pilsners
having
been
permanently
scarred
by
the
usual
american
watery
fare
but
i
find
this
one
wonderful
on
a
hot
august
afternoon
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
icecold
beer
i
would
want
o
its
average
to
below
hated
this
beer
wow
o
pretty
good
beer
i
ordered
this
at
a
bar
that
had
it
sitting
on
the
top
shelf
of
a
glass
cooler
next
to
the
light
im
guessing
that
explains
the
slight
offness
in
the
nose
also
forgot
to
check
the
date
on
bottle
still
an
awesome
pils
and
will
try
again
when
i
find
a
fresh
batch
at
store
pours
a
medium
strawgold
translucent
and
is
capped
with
a
decent
white
head
it
looks
the
part
of
a
pils
the
nose
is
nice
revealing
dry
grainy
notes
some
herbalgrassy
hop
and
a
tinge
of
mineral
the
flavor
is
much
hoppier
than
the
nose
suggests
while
still
retaining
the
same
basic
characteristics
and
has
a
pleasantly
bitterastringent
finish
easy
drinking
with
a
nice
feel
quite
a
good
take
on
the
style
o
i
love
this
beer
and
drink
it
often
i
think
it
is
one
of
victorys
best
beers
and
a
great
summer
beer
the
flavor
is
so
tasty
and
the
color
so
appetizing
i
just
love
it
o
great
pilsener
i
am
very
glad
that
this
is
now
being
distributed
to
my
area
will
pick
up
again
in
a
heartbeat
d
extremely
refreshing
beer
resulting
in
high
drinkability
while
not
overly
complex
in
taste
its
a
very
balanced
beer
with
big
hops
and
sweet
malts
would
make
a
great
session
beer
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
to
try
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
hazy
golden
with
a
substantial
long
lived
head
and
good
amount
of
lace
malt
aroma
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
earthyspicy
hops
medium
carbonation
and
medium
body
great
balance
between
grainy
malt
and
earthy
hops
lots
of
bitterness
for
a
pilsner
in
the
finish
this
beer
was
amazing
when
i
had
it
out
of
a
bottle
but
on
tap
it
is
just
out
of
this
world
may
covert
me
to
a
pilsner
lover
but
ive
said
that
before
i
just
saw
the
enjoy
by
date
of
1
20
2011
sob
this
ticks
me
off
i
will
rereview
once
i
find
a
fresh
bottle
o
just
a
great
american
take
on
the
pilsener
high
marks
across
the
board
the
folks
at
victory
seem
to
know
that
more
is
not
always
better
and
this
shows
that
a
straightforward
take
on
the
style
that
has
everything
it
needs
and
absolutely
nothing
that
it
doesnt
m
light
to
medium
body
with
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
tasted
like
a
classic
pilsner
should
the
hop
flavor
was
dominating
very
zesty
herbal
and
posessed
a
fine
bitter
tinge
the
bitterness
lingers
on
your
tongue
for
around
30
seconds
after
each
drink
just
like
in
the
aroma
there
is
a
smooth
malt
taste
that
hides
behind
the
powerful
hops
adding
to
the
drinkability
this
beer
was
crisp
and
refreshing
exactly
what
i
expect
from
a
pilsner
exactly
what
i
want
to
drink
in
the
summertime
o
i
loved
this
pilsener
so
much
taste
and
so
refreshing
i
want
more
final
thoughts
simple
yet
great
german
style
done
right
great
mouthfeel
nice
and
creamy
crisp
earthy
finish
od
highly
satisfied
with
this
brew
really
hits
the
spot
with
the
thermometer
pushing
90
no
problem
having
a
few
these
in
a
row
d
very
good
probably
the
best
you
will
get
this
side
of
the
atlantic
o
a
nice
refreshing
beer
will
have
to
give
some
others
a
shot
to
have
something
to
compare
to
great
for
summer
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
a
film
on
the
top
of
the
beer
thin
foamy
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grains
and
zesty
herbal
hops
taste
is
of
sweet
grains
and
a
astringent
bitter
herbal
and
citrus
zest
hop
kick
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pilsner
with
a
very
fresh
taste
that
is
very
refreshing
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
from
a
22
oz
bomber
into
a
pint
glass
little
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
thin
lace
drink
by
date
of
may
21st
oops
guess
i
should
have
checked
before
i
bought
it
but
i
was
in
san
diego
and
just
excited
to
see
some
stuff
i
cant
get
back
home
very
floral
hop
aroma
with
just
a
touch
of
citrus
and
i
am
picking
up
just
a
touch
a
sulfurous
aroma
as
well
although
not
enough
to
be
off
putting
this
is
like
a
classic
german
pilsner
aroma
but
beefed
up
a
bit
clean
floral
hoppiness
on
the
palate
with
a
decent
malt
backbone
again
i
get
just
a
touch
of
sulphur
on
the
palate
maybe
it
wouldnt
be
there
if
the
beer
were
fresher
not
sure
anyway
i
do
like
this
beer
quite
a
bit
not
exactly
true
to
style
as
others
have
said
but
definitely
a
hop
lovers
pilsner
o
a
hopheavy
pilsner
that
is
as
refreshing
as
it
is
dry
unreal
o
great
take
on
the
german
style
pilsner
great
for
summer
outings
if
you
want
a
beer
with
a
decently
balanced
body
and
great
refreshing
taste
the
noble
hop
flavor
sold
me
right
on
the
spot
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pilsener
it
is
light
and
refreshing
with
complexity
of
flavor
and
perfect
hop
presence
d
more
like
a
bold
pilsener
beer
very
firmly
bitter
hoppy
almost
unbalanced
more
of
a
challenge
to
the
palate
than
i
usually
think
of
for
a
pilsner
may
be
pushing
boundries
a
bit
but
at
least
in
aint
no
macro
swill
the
tast
is
light
toasted
pils
malt
with
a
mild
floral
hop
flavor
and
some
spicy
grassy
tastes
that
arent
harsh
yet
still
gives
the
impression
that
this
pils
is
highly
hop
flavored
with
a
very
mild
yeast
mineral
quality
and
light
pilsner
malt
sweetness
the
finish
is
dry
and
spicy
with
a
nice
yeasty
tinge
i
think
this
is
a
great
american
take
on
the
german
pils
style
with
a
pretty
hop
forward
taste
yet
it
is
still
within
range
to
be
considered
traditional
influenced
with
nice
noble
hop
character
and
high
drinkability
do
a
refreshing
pilsner
but
with
much
more
hops
than
normal
was
saving
this
for
an
outdoor
romp
this
summer
but
now
its
too
damn
hot
for
that
a
real
winner
from
victory
give
this
to
your
neighbor
who
likes
the
bmc
stuff
draft
redcoat
tavern
pours
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
scummy
white
head
with
surprising
lacing
aroma
is
grassy
with
light
citrus
and
flowery
hops
initial
sweetness
yields
to
significant
bitterness
and
a
long
grain
finish
getting
along
extraordinarily
well
with
my
burger
lovely
leaves
an
oily
mouthfeel
while
the
aftertaste
consists
oddly
of
that
smokey
flavor
i
seem
to
taste
overall
im
admittedly
not
a
diehard
pilsner
buff
but
this
is
a
very
good
rendition
flavorful
and
refreshing
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
or
straw
color
white
foamy
head
decent
retention
good
lacing
smells
of
hops
lemon
grass
yeast
esters
the
taste
wow
im
used
to
pilsners
being
real
light
almost
water
like
with
some
hop
bite
but
this
is
a
full
on
hoppy
pils
sort
of
like
i
remember
sa
noble
pils
being
fresh
this
is
very
good
stuff
i
get
a
tone
of
noble
hops
up
front
a
lemony
citrus
taste
then
on
the
way
down
some
grassy
biscuity
sweet
malts
quickly
followed
by
a
load
of
bitter
hops
the
feel
is
medium
light
with
good
carb
overall
this
is
a
fine
beer
probably
the
best
pilsner
ive
tasted
ill
be
sure
to
get
again
excellent
the
best
pilsner
ive
tried
the
hoppy
citrus
flavour
is
great
distinctive
but
light
if
only
i
could
drink
this
every
day
too
bad
its
a
bit
pricy
over
here
for
regular
consumption
highly
drinkable
and
highly
recommended
o
nice
beer
for
the
style
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
beer
is
a
totally
solid
pick
up
for
those
who
havent
tried
it
lots
of
flavour
light
citrus
hops
begs
to
be
drank
in
multiples
happiness
in
a
bottle
od
an
excellent
pilsner
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
as
all
get
out
gotta
be
one
of
the
best
of
the
style
appearance
is
a
light
gold
with
a
modest
white
head
that
fades
fairly
quickly
into
a
few
islands
of
white
bubbles
and
leaves
almost
no
lacing
lemon
and
grassyhay
scents
are
pleasant
on
the
nose
citrus
and
grassy
flavors
continue
on
the
tongue
with
a
slight
biscuitycracker
taste
in
the
background
this
has
some
big
hop
character
more
than
most
other
pilsners
some
prickliness
and
surprising
creaminess
make
for
excellent
mouthfeel
im
not
much
of
a
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
was
a
very
good
and
refreshing
overall
i
didnt
hate
or
love
this
one
i
know
that
pilsner
is
not
my
first
choice
of
style
but
i
also
know
that
i
have
had
a
few
that
i
really
liked
with
that
being
saidthis
was
refreshing
and
something
i
might
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
thanks
to
mcnuts
for
this
bottle
notes
ive
had
5
bottles
of
this
and
has
not
grown
on
me
stoudts
pils
seems
immediately
more
enjoyable
prima
pils
is
almost
a
drainpour
for
me
o
great
beer
that
is
extremely
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
worth
picking
up
a
6pack
anytime
you
have
some
summer
relaxing
to
do
i
recognize
that
this
is
a
well
made
beer
and
perhaps
i
will
return
to
it
at
a
later
date
but
this
isnt
up
my
alley
at
the
moment
overall
very
drinkable
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
pils
malts
nice
noble
and
bit
of
american
hops
great
pils
cant
like
pils
and
not
try
this
beer
o
a
refreshing
pils
prefect
for
a
warm
summer
day
clean
and
smooth
leaving
you
wanting
more
the
beer
doesnt
have
a
very
big
abv
but
thats
okay
it
doesnt
need
one
the
beer
is
just
so
good
plus
the
aftertaste
sticks
around
forever
i
just
love
this
beer
i
might
call
this
a
summer
beer
based
on
the
taste
of
all
the
summers
i
am
having
this
season
regardless
i
love
this
beer
o
not
too
shabby
good
session
beer
prima
pils
is
good
overall
but
i
find
i
actually
enjoy
sam
adams
noble
pils
much
more
overall
a
decent
enough
beer
but
i
was
led
to
expect
better
good
as
a
beer
but
i
dont
think
it
represents
the
style
this
beer
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
wig
a
thin
white
head
the
dissipates
rather
quickly
the
smell
is
earthy
hops
and
a
slight
malt
presence
the
flavor
is
dry
and
slighkty
bitter
from
the
hops
with
some
malt
and
earth
qualities
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
well
carbed
and
dry
overall
the
most
enjoyable
pilsner
i
have
had
a
nice
pilsner
but
a
bit
too
much
lemon
and
bitterness
nevertheless
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
thats
been
brewed
in
the
us
not
sure
what
to
make
of
this
as
it
really
doesnt
remind
me
of
a
german
pilsner
but
it
is
interesting
a
good
beer
for
a
hop
head
but
if
youre
a
pilsner
fan
this
may
not
be
up
your
alley
lots
of
hops
for
a
pilsner
which
is
why
its
so
unique
bright
beer
perfect
finish
crisp
and
slightly
soapy
flavor
brings
more
to
the
table
than
most
other
lagers
in
its
class
not
gonna
dock
it
for
carbonation
though
another
solid
beer
from
victory
overall
a
very
enjoyable
refreshing
beer
for
a
summer
day
d
a
lovely
flavour
profile
doesnt
look
the
part
for
me
but
certainly
stands
up
in
the
nose
and
taste
easy
drinking
excellent
clean
pils
o
probably
the
best
pilsner
i
have
had
i
loved
how
refreshingly
smooth
it
was
yet
provided
an
unexpected
dry
and
bitter
finish
from
the
hops
attractive
looking
smelling
and
tasting
i
would
say
this
is
a
must
try
summer
beer
you
wont
be
unsatisfied
another
masterpiece
from
victory
overall
a
crisp
hoppy
and
refreshing
pilsner
poured
ontap
and
served
in
a
pint
glass
the
beer
is
a
bright
flourescent
yellow
coloring
with
a
huge
amount
of
carbonation
there
was
a
light
foamy
white
head
across
the
top
there
were
light
aromas
of
toast
and
lemon
the
flavors
were
effervescent
and
sharp
keeping
the
beer
very
light
lemon
essence
and
toasted
malt
with
slight
sour
and
hoppy
green
undertones
the
finish
is
a
bit
musty
and
lingering
with
astringent
drying
puckering
and
any
other
adjective
that
is
slightly
uncomfortable
but
appropriate
for
the
style
overall
this
one
will
probably
come
out
to
about
a
3
2
and
im
actually
being
quite
generous
here
im
sure
by
now
you
know
what
i
thought
of
the
beer
overall
so
i
need
not
say
more
pity
because
i
actually
enjoy
this
style
quite
well
however
i
am
going
to
give
this
beer
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
will
promise
to
revisit
it
just
as
soon
as
i
finish
off
my
mouthwash
and
give
the
scars
left
behind
some
time
to
heal
overall
hoppiest
pils
ive
ever
had
doesnt
deviate
from
the
pils
profile
just
a
boatload
of
hops
i
was
very
surprised
at
the
quality
of
this
beer
it
has
a
hint
of
dark
burnt
chocolate
flavor
and
a
overall
wonderful
taste
the
after
taste
runs
away
too
quickly
making
you
crave
for
another
sip
carbonation
is
perfect
appearance
and
smell
perfect
again
i
believe
the
high
quality
hopps
and
pilsner
quality
brewing
technique
makes
this
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
ever
had
role
over
my
tongue
victory
makes
some
other
very
good
beers
but
this
one
is
their
best
overall
its
a
beer
that
i
can
enjoy
drinking
if
it
happens
to
be
around
the
house
but
i
would
not
seek
it
out
if
you
really
like
lighter
beers
with
an
undeniable
hop
profile
you
might
like
it
but
its
just
not
my
cup
of
tea
or
beer
as
it
were
dont
shy
away
from
it
but
not
something
you
necessarily
need
to
go
on
a
mission
for
overall
i
really
dont
enjoy
pilsners
and
i
really
didnt
enjoy
this
one
to
be
completely
honest
but
i
can
appreciate
how
this
is
a
stellar
example
of
an
americanized
pilsner
a
staple
or
should
be
for
any
light
german
beer
fan
who
wants
a
nice
american
hop
twist
overall
great
pilsner
wish
i
could
get
this
locally
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
this
is
a
decent
light
beer
for
the
hot
summer
days
and
a
good
interpretation
of
the
style
overall
i
will
not
buy
this
again
i
have
had
much
sweeter
pilsners
and
bought
this
on
the
off
chance
that
freshness
would
make
it
better
grassy
and
bitter
with
harsh
grains
this
beer
is
not
for
me
feels
crisp
and
clean
wetting
and
inviting
to
the
palate
overall
a
complex
pilsner
well
executed
drinkable
as
well
wouldnt
mind
this
as
a
goto
lager
thanks
knapp85
tastes
are
huge
finishing
hops
bitter
or
otherwise
more
hops
sweat
a
little
honey
shoots
wheat
malt
clean
yeast
saliva
olives
and
wood
smells
the
same
no
detection
here
i
do
so
love
victory
brewing
company
and
victory
malts
o
above
average
but
the
mouthfeel
and
tastes
dont
up
to
the
level
of
greatness
i
expect
in
a
pils
the
pils
pours
out
as
a
golden
color
with
a
white
fizzy
head
on
top
the
head
leaves
a
pretty
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
grassy
but
also
had
a
pretty
strong
hop
aroma
too
the
taste
was
malty
grassy
and
had
a
decent
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
overall
its
not
a
bad
pils
its
just
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
o
this
how
a
pilsner
should
taste
a
nice
balanced
beer
with
a
decent
amount
of
alcohol
i
could
drink
this
all
day
pours
a
fizzy
yellow
color
with
a
good
amount
of
head
not
to
be
mistaken
with
the
likes
of
a
bmc
lager
as
this
has
a
much
cloudier
and
thicker
appearance
despite
being
such
a
light
beer
smell
is
of
faint
grassy
hops
pretty
muted
for
the
most
part
however
after
checking
the
date
on
the
bottle
this
is
a
good
bit
past
its
prime
my
fault
for
not
checking
the
bottle
oops
it
holds
up
surprisingly
well
the
pleasant
grassy
hops
are
still
there
just
much
more
muted
ive
had
this
fresh
and
it
is
a
delight
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
very
refreshing
just
wish
it
was
easier
to
find
fresh
around
here
victory
bottles
always
seem
to
be
a
good
bit
past
their
prime
however
its
still
very
drinkable
and
im
enjoying
it
definitely
recommend
this
for
the
summer
just
dont
be
like
me
check
the
date
before
buying
a
hop
heads
summer
delight
overall
many
attributes
of
a
typical
pilsener
but
moreso
hop
heavy
then
many
ive
tried
being
that
im
a
hophead
this
beer
sits
well
with
me
a
great
addition
to
the
style
prosit
this
beer
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
nice
large
head
that
did
go
away
rather
quickly
the
smell
was
oddly
rater
hoppy
the
taste
was
complex
it
initaly
had
that
bit
of
a
typical
spice
note
that
is
common
with
pilsners
but
then
finished
a
bit
hoppy
the
taste
stayed
on
the
pallete
for
a
while
and
was
strong
very
strong
for
a
pilsner
overall
a
great
beer
and
a
top
pilsner
you
want
this
beer
good
and
cold
more
of
a
seasonal
choice
perhaps
but
when
you
are
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsner
and
would
like
a
little
extra
hop
bite
this
victory
prima
pils
is
great
aggressive
hop
profile
very
clean
flavors
an
excellent
pilsener
overall
one
of
the
best
german
pilsners
you
can
find
bottled
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thinner
side
of
medium
it
is
a
nice
crisp
beer
and
it
is
easily
sessionable
but
for
pilseners
i
dont
think
it
has
the
flavors
that
other
breweries
are
able
to
produce
to
make
it
something
id
drink
more
often
this
is
a
nice
brew
the
bitter
dry
finish
is
nice
it
has
a
tad
bit
of
watery
texture
but
the
flavor
is
good
taste
crisp
and
refreshing
sweet
with
a
strong
and
refreshing
bitterness
this
one
manages
to
be
complex
and
interesting
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
a
great
summer
refresher
o
such
a
fantastic
hop
forward
pilsner
so
refreshing
and
delicious
pilsners
can
be
interesting
and
awesome
overall
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
good
example
of
not
sticking
exactly
to
the
style
but
improving
on
it
by
adding
some
extra
character
to
it
o
i
chose
this
beer
for
my
first
review
bc
it
is
my
everyday
beer
one
of
the
perks
of
living
so
close
to
victory
this
beer
could
match
up
with
any
pils
from
germany
or
prague
but
it
brings
its
own
flavor
to
the
table
which
you
really
gotta
give
a
high
five
to
victory
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
great
tasting
beer
but
in
general
it
is
more
of
an
american
foral
hops
style
pils
and
should
maybe
be
in
a
different
category
than
that
of
a
czech
or
german
style
pils
which
would
have
more
of
a
crisp
grassy
and
spicy
hop
body
overall
this
comes
close
to
greatness
clear
light
straw
color
in
body
with
white
bubbly
head
that
fades
but
leaves
lacing
refreshing
aroma
of
clean
hops
pine
mint
light
grain
light
fruit
hop
forward
in
flavor
pine
wet
grass
mint
hop
leaves
light
grain
and
subtle
notes
of
floralhoney
in
the
background
finishes
elegant
and
clean
bitter
light
with
active
carbonation
refreshing
clean
a
beautiful
pilsner
my
favorite
pilsener
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
medium
bodied
with
nice
stings
from
the
carbonation
the
spiciness
also
adds
a
good
tingle
to
the
tongue
with
each
sip
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
something
im
glad
that
i
can
find
fairly
easily
goes
down
easily
and
offers
a
decent
amount
of
complex
flavors
definitely
a
great
pilsner
here
o
thought
this
was
a
great
representative
of
its
style
not
my
favorite
type
of
pilsner
so
i
dont
see
myself
gunning
to
get
it
again
it
was
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
however
really
good
beer
and
perhaps
ill
give
it
another
go
around
in
the
future
t
theres
a
nice
snap
of
grassy
hops
upfront
and
then
some
lightly
bready
malts
the
finish
is
a
lighter
return
of
grassy
hops
a
bit
of
white
pepper
and
some
lemon
very
clean
and
drinkable
and
the
mouthfeel
is
dead
on
for
the
style
the
appearance
and
smell
matches
the
bottled
version
but
the
taste
isnt
as
sweet
hops
are
more
pronounced
nice
floral
bite
with
big
dose
of
pilsener
malt
for
balance
this
is
really
good
extremely
drinkable
on
tap
one
of
americas
best
pilseners
highly
recommended
easy
to
drink
a
bold
flavor
distinctive
this
is
in
the
upper
echelon
of
the
style
without
question
o
an
excellent
pilsener
and
overall
an
excellent
beer
one
that
i
would
enjoy
having
in
my
kegerator
at
home
you
know
if
i
had
a
kegerator
hazy
straw
yellow
pour
white
bubbly
head
aroma
of
crisp
grassy
hops
faint
bit
of
must
in
the
malt

fruit
flavors
of
dry
malt
with
a
decent
bit
of

into
play
a
slight
earthinessmust
is
apparent
as
well
light
bubbly
body
crispbittermalty
throughout
with
a
dry
lingering
bitter
finish
easily
one
of
my
top
three
session
beers
its
bright
and
crisp
overall
just
a
very
satisfying
brew
that
i
drink
regularly
all
year
round
this
coupled
with
a
very
fair
price
point
makes
it
a
hard
beer
to
beat
most
definitely
my
favorite
summer
brew
as
well
as
my
favorite
pilsener
i
dont
see
what
there
is
to
not
love
about
this
beer
overall
quite
good
overall
and
the
flavor
is
well
balanced
ive
heard
that
this
one
is
head
and
shoulders
above
typical
pilsners
and
i
can
see
why
im
not
typically
a
fan
of
pilsners
but
i
can
definitely
recommend
this
one
ah
this
is
a
classic
from
victory
and
i
never
turn
down
a
pint
or
bottle
if
it
comes
my
way
that
mix
of
german
and
czech
hops
lends
this
a
distinct
kind
of
herbal
or
earthy
spiciness
that
i
really
dig
and
that
close
to
5
abv
keeps
this
right
there
at
that
approachable
level
where
you
can
have
a
couple
of
these
without
taxing
the
palate
a
whole
lot
i
love
that
im
able
to
get
this
beer
fresh
at
the
brewery
with
relative
ease
o
you
cant
go
wrong
with
this
one
a
throwback
beer
to
the
true
pilsner
enthusiasts
nice
clean
clear
pale
yellow
appearance
white
frothy
head
that
dies
off
rather
quickly
malty
and
flavorful
without
being
heavy
more
refreshing
than
my
normal
favorite
an
ipa
good
sour
hoppy
aftertaste
has
a
bit
of
flintiness
in
it
some
citrusy
notes
some
sweetness
good
balance
good
complexity
overall
complex
enough
to
be
interesting
but
remains
light
and
refreshing
pale
as
can
be
a
regal
light
gold
translucent
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
sticky
lacing
highcarbonation
crisp
very
bitter
lemony
grassy
herbal
pilsener
malts
bready
yeast
noble
hops
and
hard
minerally
water
a
highly
drinkable
summer
beer
its
not
complex
and
its
not
wowing
but
definitely
a
must
try
and
quite
the
quality
pilsener
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilseners
but
this
beer
is
a
good
introduction
to
hops
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
onefinger
bright
white
head
subpar
lacing
and
head
retention
grass
and
citrus
aroma
nothing
much
there
well
hoped
pilsener
pretty
big
floral
and
herbal
hops
to
start
solid
bitterness
nice
grassy
and
hay
flavor
adds
some
balance
before
a
bit
of
sweet
citrus
flavor
closes
the
show
finishes
dry
and
crisp
big
tasting
pills
overall
so
sessionable
poured
a
dirty
yellow
small
head
left
a
layer
of
yeast
particles
floating
on
the
top
good
lacing
marks
i
have
a
hard
time
getting
much
nose
but
i
pick
up
carbonation
if
that
has
a
smell
banana
and
some
spice
i
think
the
hop
devil
has
the
same
spicy
note
hops
come
through
the
taste
with
a
bitterness
that
lingers
banana
notes
as
well
this
is
a
light
body
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
after
my
last
couple
pilseners
i
have
realized
they
are
not
my
favorite
but
still
enjoyable
its
fresh
thirst
quenching
lively
subtly
complex
and
by
far
the
best
ive
had
in
a
category
that
i
usually
avoid
i
would
buy
again
and
drink
it
again
and
then
buy
it
again
and
then
yeah
o
awesome
pilsner
def
the
flagship
pilsner
for
me
so
far
o
this
is
one
amazing
beer
had
heard
quite
a
lot
of
good
things
about
this
one
but
was
still
blown
away
overall
this
is
a
cornerstone
of
the
american
craft
brewing
movements
history
a
beer
of
legend
that
delivers
step
away
from
the
stout
and
enjoy
what
got
us
here
in
the
first
place
medium
to
light
mouthfeel
with
a
crisp
finish
probably
the
best
pilsener
ive
ever
had
will
enjoy
this
regularly
excellent
pilsner
recently
picked
up
a
fresh
six
pack
with
late
june
consume
by
date
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
nice
foamy
head
and
good
carbonation
smells
of
nice
floral
hops
taste
is
great
crisp
bitterness
and
some
floral
hops
very
drinkable
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
pair
with
food
highly
recommended
o
i
can
definitely
see
why
theres
so
many
people
that
like
this
brew
and
its
sparked
my
interest
for
the
pilsner
style
to
me
this
beer
is
easy
enough
to
toss
back
a
few
or
more
over
some
bbq
or
anything
really
very
drinkable
the
floral
and
dryness
of
the
beer
would
be
the
only
thing
i
might
have
a
problem
with
after
a
couple
but
with
some
grub
probably
not
definitely
worth
picking
up
again
and
again
cheers
knockout
pilsner
the
only
downside
is
it
might
get
a
little
too
floralcitricbitter
after
a
few
of
these
imho
other
than
that
this
lager
has
everything
in
its
place
and
the
result
is
a
refreshing
greattasting
brew
with
a
body
and
mouthfeel
that
wont
wash
your
pallete
away
in
a
sea
of
malt
hops
and
yeast
outstanding
crisp
mouthfeel
light
body
very
drinkable
though
i
still
dont
get
the
hype
around
this
every
year
o
refreshing
overall
especially
on
a
nice
day
a
nice
pilsner
pours
out
a
straw
gold
good
bubbles
some
whispy
lacing
the
beer
smells
slightly
spicey
and
rather
grassy
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
dry
and
slightly
sweet
big
grassy
earthy
hops
greet
the
palate
and
come
off
cleanly
dry
and
bitter
wow
has
a
nice
big
green
apple
snap
to
it
something
you
only
get
from
a
fresh
hoppy
pilsner
jeez
you
know
i
wonder
how
different
the
world
would
be
if
people
learned
how
to
appreciate
what
a
real
pilsner
style
beer
tastes
like
peace
in
the
mideast
maybe
racial
harmony
possibly
anyway
not
quite
as
hard
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
as
a
true
czech
pilsner
but
slightly
smoother
overall
this
is
a
wonderful
brew
that
could
go
well
with
just
about
anything
bowling
bbq
burgers
bungeejumping
the
sky
is
the
limit
o
nice
balanced
drinkable
brew
lots
of
flavor
o
overall
this
has
opened
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
a
bright
yellow
beer
can
be
full
of
flavor
i
know
this
beer
has
a
high
overall
score
but
i
assumed
the
hop
head
in
me
would
be
sorely
disappointed
great
crisp
refreshing
summer
beer
will
seek
out
this
brew
often
o
this
is
a
fairly
good
pilsner
the
bitter
aftertaste
causes
it
to
lose
some
drinkability
but
it
is
still
a
crisp
and
enjoyable
beer
as
far
as
value
its
a
little
light
for
example
this
runs
me
8
99
a
6er
vs
radeberger
at
5
99
a
6er
and
noble
pils
or
urquell
comes
in
at
12
49
a
6er
which
are
all
also
excellent
examples
of
the
style
and
corn
free
definitely
try
it
sometime
though
its
worth
checking
out
overall
im
not
fan
of
hopped
up
beers
heresy
but
this
is
definitely
an
exception
i
can
see
myself
picking
up
another
sixpack
in
the
summer
when
it
gets
hotter
and
drinking
this
on
the
front
porch
poured
with
minimal
head
thats
not
what
i
came
to
the
beer
for
smells
outright
hoppy
as
it
warms
up
your
classic
pilsen
malt
honeygrainy
smell
comes
through
this
is
a
hop
bomb
of
a
pilsener
if
you
want
to
taste
nothing
but
saaz
for
a
while
drink
one
of
these
this
beer
will
scrape
off
your
taste
receptors
and
replace
them
with
hop
resin
i
find
that
a
good
thing
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
but
just
now
got
around
to
reviewing
it
the
beer
pours
a
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
heavy
on
the
pilsner
malt
with
some
grassy
hops
and
bready
malt
mixed
in
overall
it
smells
like
a
classic
pilsner
the
flavor
is
heavy
on
the
pilsner
malt
with
some
saaz
hops
mixed
in
tastes
like
exactly
what
you
expect
a
pilsner
to
taste
like
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
bitter
bite
feels
good
and
the
beer
is
an
easy
drinker
a
good
beer
to
be
sure
but
probably
not
my
favorite
bright
and
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
lot
bubbles
rising
from
the
body
of
my
three
stooges
pilsener
glass
a
fat
two
finger
head
that
clings
in
large
globs
around
the
sides
a
grassystraw
sweetness
with
a
zesty
hint
of
some
dried
mango
and
lemon
peel
crisp
and
bubbly
with
the
first
sip
a
lot
of
lemony
sweet
light
malt
right
after
that
tingle
but
then
it
breaks
away
into
the
hop
flavors
a
floral
blast
first
that
has
a
mild
tropical
fruitiness
that
switches
quickly
to
a
lemon
dry
bitterness
a
grassy
lemon
dry
bitterness
o
ive
found
myself
very
drawn
to
prima
pils
as
of
late
as
my
go
to
beer
of
choice
and
i
also
find
it
to
be
a
very
nice
example
of
the
pilsner
style
othis
is
a
very
good
pilsner
actually
probably
the
best
one
i
have
ever
had
it
is
perfect
for
this
time
of
year
in
miami
its
a
nice
light
beer
that
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
out
by
the
pool
or
beach
mouthfeel
is
crisp
on
the
front
and
a
little
creamy
in
the
finish
creating
a
nice
balance
of
both
overall
a
good
beer
freshness
date
on
this
bottle
is
almost
a
month
ago
however
and
i
wonder
how
that
affects
the
overall
taste
i
understand
that
good
pilsners
are
complicated
beers
that
have
a
limited
time
to
be
enjoyed
at
their
full
potential
so
i
wonder
how
much
this
one
is
affected
either
way
i
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
look
forward
to
trying
a
fresher
selection
mouthfeel
drinkability
refreshing
dry
finish
o
this
is
easily
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
ever
had
just
a
great
complex
taste
clean
and
crisp
i
think
this
is
a
great
spring
and
summer
beer
o
overall
its
not
bad
but
its
not
for
me
the
ingredients
tend
to
be
overpowering
on
almost
every
aspect
of
this
beer
mouthfeel
drinkability
extremely
light
bodied
and
refreshing
quite
a
crisp
and
dry
finish
well
balanced
between
malt
grains
barley
and
hoppy
sweetness
overall
a
decent
pilsner
but
not
outstanding
to
me
all
in
all
im
upset
i
didnt
grab
a
sixer
with
a
later
freshness
date
to
boot
as
id
like
to
see
how
sessionable
this
brew
is
either
way
great
pilsener
probably
the
best
and
most
unique
ive
had
lived
up
to
the
hype
what
a
great
pilsner
this
beer
will
be
accompanying
me
into
those
hot
summer
afternoons
taking
naps
on
the
deck
prost
d
excellent
with
only
5
abv
and
a
light
crisp
taste
this
is
an
enjoyable
beer
o
this
has
been
and
will
most
likely
remain
my
favorite
lager
victory
is
a
true
master
of
lagering
and
i
normally
hate
most
lagers
drinkability
this
is
the
best
interpretation
of
a
german
pils
ive
ever
had
the
sweetness
the
appropriate
bitterness
the
floral
hop
aroma
flavor
and
the
color
are
exceptional
very
refreshing
and
highly
recommended
moreys
bottom
line
the
flavor
from
the
hops
separates
this
pilsner
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
your
triple
hops
brewed
miller
light
drinkin
friends
might
not
even
be
able
to
handle
prima
pils
d
a
good
pilsner
i
wonder
if
the
bottle
being
a
little
past
its
fresh
date
was
maybe
why
it
wasnt
a
bit
better
ill
be
more
careful
to
check
the
date
next
time
but
i
will
give
a
try
again
soon
d
highly
drinkable
and
although
the
hop
bitterness
overpowers
the
malt
its
not
too
much
would
definitely
have
again
especially
as
a
complement
to
a
meal
poured
into
pint
glass
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
perfect
white
head
and
nice
lacing
aroma
is
crisp
with
a
good
balance
of
spicy
doughy
yeast
and
saaz
hops
flavor
matches
quite
well
with
a
pretty
strong
hop
resin
bite
for
a
pils
a
little
strong
on
the
carbonation
but
this
is
a
great
lively
summer
brew
just
hearty
enough
to
not
be
classified
as
watery
but
light
enough
to
session
wow
what
a
pilsener
awesome
hops
clean
malt
characteristics
a
perfect
summersession
brew
not
a
style
i
drink
a
lot
of
but
this
one
is
by
far
the
best
ive
had
overall
probably
my
favorite
pilsener
ive
had
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
i
dont
like
victory
and
only
like
one
other
beer
they
make
old
horizontal
but
this
may
be
their
best
beer
i
am
not
a
big
hoppy
beer
drinker
but
this
was
a
clean
crisp
refeshing
beer
has
a
nice
clean
finish
and
will
lead
you
to
drinking
more
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
this
is
quite
good
i
have
been
wanting
to
try
this
for
awhile
and
i
am
not
bummed
to
have
5
more
left
in
the
6er
d
despite
the
rather
odd
mouthfeel
and
the
almost
bland
smell
this
is
a
very
good
beer
the
crisp
spicy
hops
and
the
undercurrent
of
subtle
maltiness
make
for
two
complimentary
flavors
that
make
for
one
interesting
beer
12oz
bottle
drank
from
my
rodenbach
grand
cru
glass
a
medium
clear
dark
gold
a
nice
bright
finger
cap
great
sticky
lacing
could
be
a
touch
clearer
but
looks
fine
the
aroma
is
quite
pleasant
tons
of
sweet
grain
floral
spice
lemon
bitter
finish
very
solid
the
taste
is
zesty
lemons
grain
and
floral
notes
the
finish
is
very
bitter
and
biting
so
much
flavor
not
a
style
i
enjoy
but
this
hits
home
closest
to
the
major
euro
versions
md
mouthfeel
is
good
medium
bodied
just
creamy
enough
drinkability
is
high
because
of
the
good
crisp
finish
taste
fresh
melon
up
front
honeydew
but
the
sweetness
is
barely
noticeable
as
it
immediately
retreats
into
bitter
citrus
then
finishes
dry
with
a
tingling
spice
sensation
bergamot
has
a
real
nice
mouthfeel
and
is
very
drinkable
overall
im
thoroughly
enjoying
this
refreshing
brew
next
time
ill
try
for
some
fresher
bottles
but
this
is
still
good
enough
i
dont
go
for
pilseners
all
that
muchi
like
the
maltier
lagers
but
this
is
one
ill
certainly
buy
when
im
in
the
mood
the
cpj
d
not
high
but
a
good
beer
non
the
less
victory
never
disappoints
craft
brew
heads
always
fresh
hops
and
some
citrus
i
enjoyed
but
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
moderate
body
and
enjoyable
all
around
will
probally
only
buy
this
in
the
summer
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
refreshing
as
it
should
be
for
the
style
but
the
citrus
in
particular
aids
the
mouthfeel
quite
a
bit
drinkability
is
fantastic
although
the
malt
gets
a
bit
strong
near
the
end
it
is
really
well
balanced
for
the
most
part
md
mediumlight
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
that
can
be
felt
on
the
palate
finishes
with
a
neutral
amount
of
dryness
not
too
dry
not
too
sweet
not
the
most
complex
style
on
the
planet
but
this
one
is
easy
to
drink
especially
now
that
the
weather
is
starting
to
warm
up
great
session
beer
a
pils
with
a
good
strong
taste
and
a
kick
crisp
and
refreshing
a
light
wheat
like
grain
base
was
cut
by
a
nice
orange
rind
like
hop
flavor
that
was
quick
to
turn
nice
and
bitter
on
you
hints
of
banana
flavored
yeast
and
a
nice
finish
that
was
full
of
fresh
cut
grass
and
a
wet
hay
flavor
this
was
a
nice
medium
bodied
pilsner
much
thicker
then
you
would
normally
see
from
the
style
but
it
worked
very
well
an
outstanding
session
ale
this
was
one
i
would
have
no
issues
in
repeating
any
day
it
was
light
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
profile
and
low
abv
all
things
making
this
lean
hard
towards
being
very
seasonable
nice
light
crisp
and
refreshing
easy
to
drink
pours
a
light
golden
color
very
little
head
this
is
the
type
of
beer
i
would
use
to
trick
a
budweiser
drinker
i
love
to
see
the
expression
on
their
faces
when
they
drink
something
with
flavor
smells
of
bitter
hops
and
light
citrus
maybe
freshcut
hay
the
beer
has
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
that
pairs
well
with
a
good
cheddar
excellent
tasting
beer
crisp
and
dry
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
im
typically
a
onebeer
guy
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
overall
a
very
solid
pils
wish
noble
pils
was
as
available
as
this
is
though
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
refreshing
without
being
watery
a
great
session
beer
that
you
sit
and
drink
all
night
long
probably
my
favorite
of
the
style
d
the
quantity
of
hops
in
this
are
unlike
any
other
pilsner
ive
had
this
is
a
great
drinking
beer
and
something
i
think
anyone
from
novice
to
beer
geek
can
enjoy
2
10
a
single
pours
a
decent
looking
clear
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
a
little
lacing
smells
of
grain
and
citrus
hops
and
tastes
much
the
same
with
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
and
a
little
biscuit
or
grain
in
there
medium
mouthfeel
with
a
thick
carbonation
drinkability
is
alright
d
if
the
uber
pils
from
hs
wasnt
available
this
would
be
my
next
pick
and
yes
i
know
im
in
the
miority
on
this
one
pours
a
clear
gold
the
smell
of
noble
hops
is
very
strong
the
flavor
has
a
minerally
quality
but
primarily
theres
pilsner
malt
noble
hops
and
bitterness
lots
of
good
stuff
to
taste
here
but
in
my
mind
its
too
bitter
if
theyd
ease
back
on
the
bittering
hop
additions
this
would
be
one
for
the
ages
still
the
most
flavorful
american
lager
in
recent
memory
overall
this
is
one
of
the
best
examples
of
the
style
i
have
ever
had
its
was
super
refreshing
with
a
great
flavor
i
could
surely
sit
and
enough
a
sixer
of
this
without
a
problem
this
could
be
a
great
session
brew
for
myself
i
would
have
to
say
the
heavy
handed
hops
in
this
brew
some
people
might
say
its
to
much
another
great
brew
by
victory
brewing
company
it
pours
with
a
2
12
inch
white
head
that
has
pretty
good
retension
the
color
is
a
very
clear
pale
golden
smell
was
a
bit
skunky
with
a
light
hoppy
background
the
flavor
was
far
better
than
the
smell
slight
german
malt
flavor
with
a
pretty
hoppy
finish
mouthfeel
light
and
refreshing
this
beer
would
be
a
great
lawn
mowing
beer
overall
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
victory
but
this
one
fell
a
bit
short
the
hops
and
color
are
good
but
everything
else
is
lacking
mouthfeel
is
too
watery
like
a
crossover
brew
im
not
impressed
by
this
one
excellent
drinkability
crisp
and
clean
light
and
flavorful
very
enjoyable
definitely
a
beer
that
could
and
probably
should
be
had
throughout
a
hot
summer
day
d
this
beer
is
definitely
drinkable
pretty
refreshing
come
to
think
of
it
the
bitterness
might
get
a
bit
much
though
drinkability
is
real
solid
and
easy
and
unique
this
is
a
great
beer
for
summer
prima
is
an
excellent
pilsner
i
drank
it
on
a
buss
trip
to
the
victory
brewing
co
which
was
three
hours
from
my
hometown
the
mouthfeel
was
easy
and
smooth
and
no
harshness
in
the
after
taste
im
thinking
that
it
is
the
little
twist
that
victory
puts
in
to
make
it
their
own
cheers
d
very
quaffable
and
extremely
delicious
this
is
a
great
session
lager
im
still
not
much
of
a
pilsner
fan
but
this
is
one
of
the
best
ive
had
overall
i
though
that
this
was
one
good
plilsener
i
enjoyed
the
fact
that
this
one
had
a
little
more
hops
then
your
normal
pilsener
which
helped
make
this
beer
pretty
unique
for
its
style
i
am
glad
i
tried
this
beer
and
it
gave
me
a
good
first
impression
of
victory
i
would
buy
this
again
hopefully
i
will
find
it
fresh
d
it
takes
a
lot
of
getting
used
to
for
me
i
enjoyed
it
half
the
time
and
half
the
time
i
felt
like
i
had
to
force
it
down
some
may
suggest
this
is
a
pilsner
for
ipa
fans
since
it
accentuates
the
hops
but
i
just
cant
really
enjoy
it
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
pilsners
but
thought
this
would
convert
me
it
didnt
drinkability
its
good
but
i
would
need
to
pair
another
one
of
these
with
the
right
meal
to
enjoy
another
i
suspect
this
beer
would
be
better
and
perhaps
not
as
bitter
if
i
had
gotten
it
before
its
best
by
date
a
good
experience
certainly
better
suited
to
warmer
weather
than
february
in
beantown
its
not
bad
and
i
could
probably
drink
another
but
im
surprised
that
it
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
for
this
style
oh
crapi
think
the
camera
man
just
got
eaten
by
a
demon
d
i
had
pretty
high
hopes
for
this
one
and
it
just
didnt
live
up
to
it
the
acidicmetallic
flavor
was
just
too
strong
and
up
front
and
i
found
the
hopmalt
flavors
to
be
a
bit
one
dimensional
this
still
drinks
fairly
easily
though
cheers
matt
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
easy
as
well
as
being
a
drinkable
beer
this
is
a
very
refreshing
brew
and
due
to
the
perfect
balance
it
is
one
beer
that
i
could
have
any
time
any
place
drinkability
is
indeed
very
high
certainly
worth
a
try
if
you
havent
had
the
chance
to
try
it
so
far
highly
recommended
overall
this
is
a
surprising
pilsner
by
european
standards
this
has
been
way
overhopped
bear
that
in
mind
before
diving
in
exceptionally
drinkable
could
have
this
one
all
day
long
d
really
tasty
brew
easily
could
down
a
six
of
this
while
keeping
my
shit
together
not
my
favorite
from
victory
but
a
really
really
drinkable
brew
overall
not
as
good
as
hopdevil
not
even
close
d
the
strong
floral
flavors
in
this
are
interesting
and
unique
yet
overpowering
and
slightly
overbearing
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
drink
more
than
1
of
these
however
this
is
a
nice
onceinawhile
beer
for
me
to
mix
it
up
with
a
lighter
meal
etc
d
excellent
drinkable
beer
would
work
well
on
its
own
or
a
session
d
overall
love
the
beer
great
sessionable
beer
with
the
abv
and
body
while
its
complex
it
isnt
complex
enough
to
keep
me
coming
back
for
another
drinkability
probably
my
go
to
pilsner
victory
nailed
the
style
with
this
one
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
not
very
filling
could
easily
drink
a
lot
in
one
sitting
would
be
great
as
a
cold
beer
on
a
hot
day
and
something
refreshing
after
work
drinkability
light
malt
and
plenty
of
hops
crisp
and
clean
a
great
session
beer
that
is
very
drinkable
i
look
forward
to
this
one
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
transparent
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
hops
and
light
malt
very
crisp
scent
the
taste
echoes
the
scent
good
hoppy
and
light
malt
flavors
very
refreshing
the
mouthfeelnus
medium
with
strong
carbonation
this
is
a
drinkable
and
enjoyable
beer
but
i
dont
ubderstand
why
it
scores
as
highly
as
it
does
its
a
great
german
pilsner
but
there
are
great
german
breweries
that
are
doing
this
style
much
better
and
have
for
many
years
this
is
a
good
american
version
that
i
quite
enjoyed
but
there
are
people
out
there
who
can
do
it
better
mouthfeel
like
the
taste
is
just
above
average
in
my
book
the
powdery
taste
also
translates
into
a
dryness
that
i
just
dont
dig
the
carbonation
is
spot
on
and
light
body
really
makes
this
one
an
easy
drinker
all
in
all
no
real
badness
here
its
a
satisfying
brew
and
one
that
you
can
drink
again
and
again
in
the
mouth
prima
pils
is
light
bodied
and
crisp
carbonation
is
moderate
and
appropriate
to
style
i
could
wish
that
it
finished
a
little
cleaner
but
that
is
a
mild
complaint
5

abv
goes
undetected
drinkability
will
depend
on
your
taste
for
hops
and
europeanstyle
lagers
personally
im
not
a
hophead
but
despite
the
strong
hoppy
bitterness
i
still
found
this
beer
to
be
incredibly
drinkable
its
a
very
cool
twist
on
an
ageold
style
that
i
would
recommend
to
fans
of
pale
ale
and
traditional
lager
styles
alike
prima
pils
is
very
well
done
this
was
the
best
of
the
night
for
me
pours
a
pale
hazy
unfiltered
yellow
nice
stick
smelled
of
hops
and
lemons
and
flowers
tasted
lemons
right
away
balanced
hops
this
is
a
crisp
and
inviting
pilsener
with
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
and
is
highly
drinkable
overall
this
is
not
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
pilsner
i
want
crisp
hoppy
refreshingly
drinkable
not
muddled
citrusy
randomness
with
an
wheatlike
dense
mouthfeel
a
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
pure
white
head
nice
bits
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
bed
of
pale
malt
and
crisp
spicy
hops
pepper
and
grassy
with
lemongrass
notes
some
citrus
as
well
taste
is
not
you
average
pilsner
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
dough
some
yeast
based
breadiness
firm
and
spicy
hop
finish
with
a
bit
of
grapefruit
and
a
lightly
sour
dryness
crisp
light
feel
is
softly
carbonated
super
quenching
and
drinkinable
an
excellent
session
beer
and
anything
else
you
may
have
in
mind
very
bready
in
the
flavor
biscuit
present
definitely
yeasty
with
a
bit
of
astringency
the
light
citrus
in
the
nose
doesnt
show
up
in
the
taste
at
all
but
instead
this
brew
is
more
and
more
malt
forward
as
it
approaches
room
temperature
overly
light
carbonation
gets
marks
down
on
this
dry
finishing
pils
to
me
this
is
going
to
serve
as
the
benchmark
for
all
pilseners
out
there
just
that
good
overall
my
humble
opinion
here
but
taste
and
mouthfeelwise
prima
is
an
extremely
fair
representation
of
a
beer
style
that
is
popular
nationwide
in
germany
but
has
few
accurate
imitators
here
in
the
states
i
could
and
have
drank
copious
amounts
of
prima
pils
id
love
to
drink
a
better
pilsner
than
prima
pils
but
until
i
make
a
pilgrimage
to
europe
i
doubt
thatll
happen
and
even
then
well
see
a
nice
session
beer
will
have
to
try
again
in
the
heat
of
summer
i
would
say
that
being
one
who
tends
to
lean
towards
the
darker
and
more
bitter
i
was
pleasantly
suprised
and
do
intend
on
purchasing
prima
in
the
futer
d
ill
just
say
im
glad
i
didnt
get
a
six
pack
d
meh
overall
seems
like
it
is
a
miss
on
the
noble
hops
the
bitterness
is
too
much
and
it
lacks
the
clean
crisp
flavor
i
expect
for
this
style
it
seems
like
everyone
goes
gaga
for
this
beer
but
for
me
it
is
a
pretty
big
miss
thought
i
would
give
it
a
second
try
and
i
am
still
not
impressed
this
was
poured
from
a
cold
22
oz
bomber
into
a
chilled
fluted
schlitz
glass
i
admit
this
to
a
group
who
largely
shun
a
chilled
glass
as
do
i
but
this
was
perfect
tonite
man
i
feel
like
a
rugged
workin
american
man
with
my
chilled
glass
golden
and
slightly
cloudyhazy
with
a
good
looking
pure
white
head
smells
of
spicey
hops
malts
and
it
has
a
grainy
aroma
to
it
this
brew
has
a
distinctly
bready
feel
to
it
at
first
sip
which
leads
into
an
abundance
of
spicy
hop
flavor
a
freshearthy
and
grainy
taste
a
biscuity
malt
profile
and
a
slight
sweetness
this
beer
tastes
fresh
has
a
nice
refreshing
feel
to
it
and
follows
up
with
a
crisp
and
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
its
a
masterpiece
overall
best
by
date
well
past
and
probably
contributed
to
a
lower
quality
i
expect
more
from
victory
brewing
ive
always
enjoyed
their
beers
and
needless
to
say
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
that
i
had
picked
up
a
beer
with
an
enjoy
by
date
from
a
little
over
a
month
ago
will
definitely
have
to
try
this
again
notes
not
bad
for
pennsyltucky
d
very
drinkable
strong
in
flavor
but
refreshing
in
its
character
recommend
above
storm
king
any
day
md
light
body
ends
dry
super
drinkable
maybe
a
touch
bitter
for
some
but
great
to
me
at
the
top
of
my
list
for
american
interpretations
of
the
style
quite
good
my
first
victory
brewing
beer
and
i
am
impressed
all
around
an
excellent
beer
despite
being
in
a
style
thats
less
popular
than
stouts
or
ipas
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
regularly
mouthfeel
is
fairly
thick
for
a
pils
due
to
the
resinous
hops
but
i
am
a
fan
which
is
why
i
grabbed
the
case
probbly
wouldnt
drink
more
than
4
maybe
5
in
one
sitting
but
as
far
as
drinkability
goes
it
certainly
has
plenty
of
it
a
good
unique
pils
to
try
but
im
sure
there
are
better
and
i
will
find
them
definitely
the
best
pils
on
the
planet
just
an
outstanding
crisp
pils
with
an
advanced
pedigree
of
flavor
buy
this
one
in
a
case
with
confidence
great
in
a
bottle
and
the
ultimate
is
to
enjoy
one
on
tap
at
the
brewery
restaurant
geat
job
victory
d
pretty
drinkable
session
beer
a
good
one
to
have
at
a
wedding
and
other
occassions
where
the
macro
and
craft
guys
mix
dvery
good
session
beer
and
excellent
gateway
brew
for
your
stubborn
american
macro
friends
md
smooth
like
bodied
perfect
carbonation
i
could
drink
this
stuff
all
night
very
well
balanced
and
extremely
refreshing
also
very
attractive
looking
when
poured
correctly
has
a
nice
glow
about
it
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
victory
and
sure
to
be
a
pleaser
if
i
were
to
buy
a
whole
case
since
i
live
in
pa
and
all
on
tap
at
the
office
pours
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
long
lasting
white
head
aroma
is
light
of
grassy
hops
very
dry
earthy
hops
dominate
the
flavor
from
the
beginning
with
some
maltiness
in
the
background
long
dry
finish
well
im
just
not
a
pilsner
lover
try
this
beer
on
a
warm
summer
day
or
night
as
a
chaser
for
hard
alcohol
or
any
time
really
dvery
high
it
would
be
easy
to
have
many
of
these
d
being
a
hophead
this
is
the
pilsner
for
me
overall
an
awesome
beer
and
an
overall
excellent
example
of
the
style
it
could
be
a
little
lighter
and
a
little
more
effervescent
but
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
this
d
not
quite
a
session
beer
but
close
finished
off
the
bottle
with
some
ordinary
medium
cheddar
and
it
was
great
if
not
better
prost
overall
a
good
take
on
the
pilsener
style
theres
not
a
whole
lot
to
say
about
it
since
its
quite
simple
but
its
still
well
done
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
so
i
just
tried
to
review
against
the
style
it
wasnt
as
hoppy
on
tap
as
i
remember
it
being
in
a
bottle
given
the
beers
hoppiness
i
cant
help
but
think
of
the
miller
commercials
claiming
it
is
triple
hopped
brewed
for
that
great
pilsener
taste
well
if
you
want
an
actually
decent
example
of
that
kind
of
thing
go
with
prima
pils
cheers
without
a
doubt
the
hoppiest
pilsener
that
ive
ever
had
and
perhaps
the
best
d
perhaps
too
hoppy
for
a
traditional
pils
i
still
very
much
enjoy
this
one
one
of
the
better
domestic
lagers
in
the
country
drinkability
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
highly
enjoyable
pilsener
this
may
be
the
best
pils
ive
had
outside
of
europe
it
definitely
has
all
the
qualities
that
one
looks
for
in
a
germanstyle
pilsener
definitely
worth
a
shot
and
definitely
something
ill
pick
up
again
d
highly
drinkable
as
expected
from
a
while
the
hops
flavors
allow
you
to
enjoy
every
sip
a
fantastic
interpretation
of
a
german
pilsner
with
an
assload
of
hops
you
could
drink
this
all
day
pours
a
just
slightly
translucent
gold
with
a
frothy
head
and
some
lacing
smell
very
prominent
floral
hops
with
slight
maltiness
the
smell
is
quite
appetizing
drinks
very
smooth
feel
the
pinch
of
hops
on
the
tongue
with
a
lingering
grapefruitlike
bitterness
with
a
not
too
wet
or
dry
finish
overall
a
spectacular
pilsner
with
a
surprisingly
high
dosage
of
hops
and
honestly
in
this
category
i
think
holds
its
own
or
surpasses
the
german
counterparts
prost
this
is
a
rather
good
german
beer
that
i
would
rather
have
than
a
budweiser
its
sessionable
its
a
strong
tasting
beer
that
ill
recommend
but
probably
not
encounter
again
for
quite
a
while
this
is
the
first
review
of
my
thanksgiving
beers
poured
into
pint
glass
one
finger
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
cloudy
pale
yellow
color
the
aroma
has
hints
of
flowers
cirus
and
hops
nice
hop
flavor
for
a
pilsner
hints
of
lemon
and
citrus
finishes
nice
and
dry
i
am
impressed
very
robust
crisp
refreshing
and
flavorful
if
you
are
looking
to
change
miller
lite
drinkers
this
is
the
beer
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
white
head
aroma
of
citrusy
piney
hops
some
light
malt
and
yeast
taste
is
similar
to
aroma
palate
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
crisp
mouthfeel
finish
has
strong
piney
hops
presence
with
some
light

light
bready
notes
and
some
malt
overall
a
descent
brew
when
i
first
poured
this
i
was
skeptical
but
prima
pils
turned
out
to
be
well
awesome
thanks
to
ba
for
steering
me
in
the
direction
of
this
outstanding
pilsner
semiopaque
golden
straw
colored
pour
frothy
off
white
sticky
head
with
awesome
lacy
retention
smell
of
grass
and
biscuity
malts
some
spicy
notes
in
smell
too
biting
herbal
hops
are
beautifully
meshed
with
semisweet
malt
dry
finish
brings
back
the
hops
again
tantalizing
carbonation
and
somewhat
oily
mouthfeel
is
very
pleasant
this
is
a
fine
pilsner
probably
the
best
i
have
had
an
uncommon
hops
signature
with
a
traditional
biscuit
malt
character
i
cant
believe
how
good
this
goes
down
another
victory
for
me
if
you
like
the
type
this
may
be
a
good
beer
for
you
but
i
dont
care
for
the
bitter
aftertaste
that
hangs
on
the
tongue
i
wont
be
going
back
to
this
one
again
but
thats
just
my
taste
i
wouldnt
stop
anyone
else
from
drinking
it
d
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
pilsner
more
hop
character
in
this
beer
than
expected
but
a
decent
malt
back
bone
balances
it
out
some
great
eminently
drinakable
beer
with
a
big
flavor
this
is
a
pils
im
not
so
sure
regardless
ill
be
coming
back
to
this
one
again
bottle
pours
a
fairly
clear
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
fizzy
head
nose
is
fresh
wheat
gentle
grassy
hops
and
a
bit
of
lemony
crisp
highly
refined
flavor
the
hops
are
gentle
and
meld
perfectly
with
the
bright
citric
qualities
has
only
a
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
not
quite
as
good
as
the
cbc
pilseners
from
victory
but
a
pleasure
to
drink
nonetheless
drinkability
this
is
a
beer
you
could
really
spend
some
time
with
in
an
evening
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
and
light
enough
to
be
very
sessionable
overall
a
nice
overly
hopped
pilsner
definatly
worth
a
try
a
good
beer
but
not
great
imo
admittedly
not
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
and
the
taste
is
pretty
nice
just
doesnt
bring
it
all
together
to
take
it
to
that
next
level
solid
brew
though
moderate
body
and
a
vey
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
d
drinkability
is
moderate
a
bit
unbalanced
for
my
liking
and
caught
somewhere
between
a
pilsener
and
ipa
without
getting
the
finer
features
of
either
an
interesting
beer
but
i
dont
think
ill
seek
it
out
again
still
quite
pleased
with
this
beer
but
would
not
buy
it
to
satisfy
a
craving
for
a
german
pils
i
would
rate
this
very
highly
as
an
ipa
but
if
you
would
excuse
me
im
going
to
go
get
a
radeberger
d
d
if
youre
looking
for
a
pilsener
this
beer
is
a
wellbuilt
one
with
pilsener
hops
packed
in
every
sip
you
wont
be
let
down
brewers
did
a
great
job
making
this
beer
emphasizing
on
quality
if
i
was
a
big
fan
of
pilseners
this
would
probably
be
one
of
my
top
choices
im
reviewing
this
beer
again
since
i
just
bought
their
mix
12
pack
and
this
was
in
there
you
get
that
pilsner
malt
grain
smell
but
it
smells
sweet
and
delicious
the
hops
come
through
the
most
in
the
smell
though
with
a
pretty
pungent
sharp
fruity
herbal
note
the
taste
is
fantastic
with
the
pilsner
cake
malt
taste
in
the
beginning
then
the
hops
come
in
pretty
sharp
and
adding
some
fruity
overtones
and
then
the
malt
comes
in
again
to
balance
out
some
of
the
bitterness
the
hops
prevail
though
and
leave
you
with
a
sharp
dry
bitterness
this
is
seriously
hoppier
then
some
ipas
ive
had
this
could
almost
pass
for
an
ipa
because
of
the
dryness
bitterness
and
the
fact
that
they
use
a
light
malt
to
showcase
the
hops
more
you
can
tell
they
use
german
hops
instead
of
american
this
and
my
antonia
from
dogfish
head
are
very
similar
but
both
are
my
favorite
pilsner
beers
to
date
d
if
i
didnt
know
any
better
id
think
this
was
from
a
top
german
brewery
it
is
a
terrific
beer
despite
being
a
somewhat
unpopular
style
d
easily
sessionable
with
a
surprisingly
hoppy
taste
this
beer
pours
the
distinct
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
dense
half
finger
of
foam
head
that
is
expected
with
a
pilsener
the
aroma
is
mild
in
nature
but
hints
at
being
a
spicy
lemon
pepper
flavor
the
smell
has
a
biscuit
like
smell
almost
combining
into
an
aroma
that
is
akin
to
lemon
curd
the
taste
however
is
decidedly
less
exciting
its
a
solid
pilsener
but
lack
any
depth
whatsoever
its
still
above
average
flavor
but
not
by
much
there
is
a
dry
crisp
lemon
and
grass
flavor
spiced
with
coriander
the
saving
grace
of
this
beer
is
that
while
there
is
some
bitterness
to
it
it
drinks
really
very
smoothly
and
goes
down
nice
and
easy
i
could
see
this
being
used
to
pull
people
away
from
bmc
products
overall
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
a
fine
representation
of
the
style
drink
i
could
see
at
the
beach
or
river
downing
a
6
pack
that
would
be
quite
nice
heres
to
summer
coming
back
extremely
drinkable
its
the
kinda
beer
that
makes
me
wish
my
glass
was
bottomless
excellent
for
a
session
beer
drinkability
i
would
without
a
doubt
find
this
beer
again
it
offers
a
well
balanced
taste
while
making
you
want
more
the
freshness
is
amazing
and
taste
draws
you
in
for
more
i
tried
this
beer
on
a
whim
at
a
beer
festival
not
expecting
more
than
a
good
beer
turns
out
it
was
a
great
beer
the
most
unique
aspect
of
this
beer
was
the
flavor
which
i
would
describe
as
distinctly
fresh
and
herbal
its
reminded
me
of
basil
i
am
definitely
planning
on
seeking
out
this
beer
from
a
retailer
and
bringing
it
home
d
prima
pils
is
an
unbelievable
brew
victory
created
a
brew
that
exhibits
high
point
in
all
aspects
this
is
an
excellent
brew
for
warm
weather
very
drinkable
and
delicious
in
my
opinion
this
is
the
best
pilsner
in
the
universe
d
an
excellent
and
enjoyable
pilsner
brilliant
execution
i
will
buy
this
again
d
not
bad
really
the
hops
will
slow
you
down
but
the
malt
keeps
it
mellow
smooth
in
any
case
i
found
the
flavor
interesting
enough
to
keep
me
sipping
sipping
pours
a
niceclear
golden
straw
color
with
plenty
of
visible
carbonaion
bubbles
nice
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
nose
is
grain
and
fresh
noble
hops
herbal
floral
and
a
tad
earthy
taste
balances
the
grain
and
bitterness
quite
well
great
crisp
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
levels
drinks
really
well
and
is
a
spring
and
summer
staple
for
me
d
overall
prima
pils
is
an
excellent
pilsner
that
is
one
of
the
best
beers
within
the
style
highly
recommended
this
is
by
far
the
best
pilsener
style
beer
that
ive
had
and
probably
will
remain
that
way
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
style
but
im
a
huge
fan
of
this
beer
if
you
havent
tried
it
do
so
overall
lots
of
good
impressions
on
this
beer
this
german
pils
style
is
a
bit
hoppier
than
most
bohemianczech
styles
that
i
also
really
enjoy
but
it
is
still
very
balanced
very
drinkable
with
great
hop
and
malt
profiles
overall
very
good
beer
overall
i
would
definitely
recommend
checking
this
one
out
overall
great
beer
this
is
a
great
pils
one
of
the
best
out
there
im
usually
an
apa
fan
but
this
would
do
any
night
of
the
week
the
bitterness
is
a
bit
much
for
me
for
this
style
although
i
like
the
flavor
on
the
body
quite
a
bit
im
not
sure
if
id
reach
for
this
one
when
im
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
but
its
certainly
decent
dthis
is
one
of
the
better
hoppy
pilsners
on
the
market
and
one
of
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
on
a
hot
day
dthis
is
crisp
enjoyful
beer
all
the
way
through
the
taste
stays
this
was
over
hopped
to
my
palate
and
had
a
strange
aftertaste
of
bitterness
that
was
not
enjoyable
the
normal
bitter
refreshing
characteristics
are
gone
and
the
overly
bitter
exotic
tastes
come
through
in
a
way
you
do
not
want
to
drink
them
this
made
urquells
taste
seem
amazingly
more
refreshing
and
enjoyable
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
would
make
an
awesome
session
beer
and
is
even
a
great
beer
to
introduce
others
to
great
beer
without
throwing
them
out
of
their
comfort
zone
too
much
its
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
its
loaded
with
flavor
not
filling
and
refreshing
all
the
makings
of
a
great
beer

finally
finally
finally
found
a
fresh
bottle
of
this
this
has
me
enjoying
by
may
3rd
2011
much
better
the
hops
are
more
pungent
that
i
remember
and
the
taste
is
super
crisp
and
refreshing

this
is
really
a
terrific
pilsner
at
over
5
abv
and
loaded
with
hop
flavor
it
feels
like
a
big
beer
but
hits
the
spot
on
a
sunny
september
day
its
dry
and
full
of
saaz
bite
this
is
one
of
the
most
robust
pilsners
that
i
have
ever
tasted
and
i
believe
is
a
shining
example
of
the
style
a
quality
german
pilsner
that
can
stand
toetotoe
with
ipas
drink
well
my
friends
im
thinking
this
would
go
great
with
some
wurst
and
red
cabbage
though
only
5
3
abv
it
packs
a
wallop
savor
dont
pound
tastes
just
fine
as
it
warms
to
room
temperature
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
once
it
is
colder
out
not
so
much
but
in
tx
when
does
it
get
cold
i
would
definitely
recommend
this
beer
it
is
a
great
value
it
would
be
a
good
beer
to
keep
on
hand
overall
i
absolutely
love
lagers
im
a
contrarian
when
it
comes
to
most
people
on
this
sight
in
that
regard
ive
just
been
constantly
disappointed
by
this
beer
the
gaffel
kolsch
an
ale
i
know
and
the
radeberger
i
had
prior
just
showed
so
much
more
craftsmanship
and
subtlety
that
this
beer
ultimately
just
fell
short
a
nearly
perfect
example
of
the
style
a
bit
under
carbonated
for
my
taste
smell
and
taste
are
dead
on
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
completely
leaves
you
dry
wanting
more
and
the
abv
makes
it
ideal
to
toss
these
back
all
day
love
this
beer
drinkability
its
not
filling
and
low
abv
so
its
very
drinkable
definitely
a
great
substitute
for
some
bmc
crap
if
youre
looking
to
put
down
quite
a
few
brews
if
i
had
drank
this
straight
from
the
bottle
i
would
have
thought
it
was
unbelievable
for
a
lighter
beer
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slightly
thin
as
it
should
be
very
well
carbed
which
fills
it
up
a
bit
very
solid
beer
this
is
an
intensely
good
pilsner
nice
beer
d
very
high
the
definition
of
a
light
beer
for
any
time
of
year
and
with
almost
any
food
the
beer
has
a
higher
carbonation
lighter
body
refreshing
easy
drinkin
good
for
a
hot
summer
day
d
i
bought
this
because
ive
only
heard
good
things
about
it
i
gave
it
a
pretty
good
review
but
i
also
dont
really
see
what
all
the
hubbub
was
about
it
was
just
another
good
variation
of
a
pilsner
in
my
eyes
could
get
something
similar
for
a
smaller
price
in
the
store
and
still
be
more
than
happy
relatively
clear
color
some
cloudiness
beautiful
light
straw
color
white
foam
disappears
quickly
thin
lace
remains
around
edge
of
glass
expected
longer
lasting
foam
for
this
style
faint
hop
aroma
mild
malt
aroma
with
spicy
notes
slightly
bitter
with
medium
dry
finish
malty
presence
in
beginning
dont
find
hops
to
be
overbearing
but
definitely
remains
at
end
high
carbonation
beer
remains
light
and
refreshing
very
drinkable
and
well
balanced
notes
this
will
probly
be
the
highest
i
rate
a
pilsner
pilsners
are
my
least
favorite
type
of
beer
dont
know
why
just
think
theyre
very
bland
i
have
to
hand
it
to
victory
though
as
this
is
the
best
one
ive
had
i
will
agree
with
the
hype
around
this
and
the
accolades
this
gets
but
still
just
not
for
me
drink
a
world
class
beer
that
i
will
be
happy
to
purchase
and
drink
again
and
again
overall
this
pilsner
is
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
with
plenty
of
flavor
i
usually
find
pilsners
a
bit
underwhelming
but
this
one
has
much
more
hop
bitterness
than
usual
and
a
very
nice
balance
quite
simply
the
best
pilsener
on
the
market
drinkability
is
average
with
how
bitter
and
bracing
it
is
i
dont
know
if
i
could
have
had
another
one
im
really
hoping
that
the
bottle
i
had
was
just
a
bad
one
will
have
to
see
if
i
can
find
one
thats
within
the
freshness
date
as
it
stands
a
decent
pilsner
with
an
interesting
floral
taste
but
a
very
bitter
character
overall
balanced
a
little
bit
too
much
to
the
bitterness
for
this
style
would
have
liked
to
see
more
hop
flavor
in
finish
overall
a
good
beer
would
drink
again
its
a
solid
pilsner
nice
flavor
very
drinkable
and
refreshing
i
like
it
dhave
come
to
love
this
beer
over
time
i
love
the
hop
profile
of
this
beer
and
its
ridiculous
drinkability
this
one
is
usually
loved
by
any
who
i
have
had
try
it
perhpas
my
favorite
pilsener
because
of
the
american
hoppiness
i
find
to
be
noticeable
in
this
beers
great
flavor
d
i
usually
stay
away
from
pils
but
this
one
had
such
high
praise
i
had
to
try
it
i
was
not
disappointed
if
more
pils
tasted
like
this
i
would
buy
them
way
more
often
d
damn
its
a
good
beer
ill
drink
it
anytime
its
one
of
my
gotos
for
a
bomber
its
only
3
29
great
beer
great
price
great
beer
d
as
any
pils
should
be
is
drinkable
and
so
far
havent
found
any
that
arent
is
could
be
given
to
be
blind
and
id
swear
it
was
from
germany
d
refreshing
and
very
delicious
with
a
great
abv
and
overall
taste
i
still
think
noble
pils
is
more
tasty
but
this
is
a
close
second
in
my
opinion
pours
a
yellowgolden
color
scents
of
cut
grass
hay
are
upfront
with
scents
of
hops
this
beers
flavor
is
slighty
dry
and
bread
like
some
herbal
flavors
but
overly
hoppy
this
is
one
beer
to
reach
for
in
the
summer
it
certainly
pairs
well
with
bbq
and
backyard
cookouts
as
high
as
it
gets
reviewed
from
my
notes
the
beer
has
a
good
sized
white
foamy
head
large
bubbles
can
be
seen
rising
the
liquid
is
clear
and
straw
colored
there
are
a
lot
of
grassy
hops
in
the
nose
it
also
is
a
tad
sweet
the
flavor
has
a
good
pale
malt
base
with
whole
grain
hops
that
are
present
throughout
each
sip
and
linger
on
after
each
swallow
it
has
a
light
body
and
a
lot
of
carbonation
there
isnt
much
coat
just
a
little
bit
is
left
behind
the
beer
is
quite
drinkable
and
satisfying
i
believe
any
craft
beer
fan
could
easily
enjoy
a
few
rounds
of
this
beer
db
a
hoppy
pils
especially
in
the
floral
department
starts
and
finishes
hoppy
definitely
a
refreshing
smooth
beer
to
kick
back
with
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
session
at
night
if
i
were
a
betting
man
and
i
am
i
would
wager
that
victory
has
switched
hop
type
here
i
hope
its
just
temporary
bc
its
really
done
the
beer
a
disservice
and
im
rating
this
current
batch
accordingly
this
is
my
last
in
the
six
pack
which
i
have
drunk
slowly
over
the
course
of
the
last
week
or
so
this
beer
has
grown
on
me
a
bit
the
more
i
sat
and
lingered
with
it
this
is
a
memorable
american
hopsoriented
pilsner
theres
no
secret
to
this
beer
theres
a
huge
picture
of
a
hop
on
the
front
smells
like
hops
tastes
like
hops
but
it
really
isnt
to
bitter
and
goes
down
nice
m
feels
smooth
in
the
mouth
a
bit
like
water
perhaps
that
is
a
poor
descriptor
but
most
beers
do
not
fell
like
water
to
me
not
exactly
the
same
as
the
versions
i
tried
in
germany
but
excellent
in
its
own
right
and
covers
enough
of
what
i
look
for
in
the
style
to
make
it
a
likely
goto
if
it
were
locally
available
highly
recommended
probably
top
five
domestic
versions
of
the
style
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
day
everyday
and
never
get
sick
of
it
prima
pils
does
every
single
thing
right
that
all
bmc
pilsners
do
wrong
and
it
shows
this
beer
is
beautiful
really
wellbalanced
and
so
easydrinking
i
didnt
care
for
this
beer
the
first
couple
times
but
im
fairly
sure
the
first
one
was
oldflat
and
the
second
time
around
i
was
just
plain
wrong
really
enjoyable
brew
d
i
could
drink
this
all
day
its
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
ive
ever
had
its
balanced
without
being
overly
bitter
and
can
accompany
many
different
foods
d
nice
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
clean
pilsener
that
is
quite
refresh
d
very
good
but
suffers
from
the
cloyingness
i
often
get
with
highly
hopped
noble
hop
beers
i
could
drink
a
couple
but
theyd
get
heavy
on
the
palate
after
that
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
light
haze
nice
white
head
that
leaves
behind
wet
lacings
light
floral
aroma
with
hints
of
grain
and
grass
refreshing
carbonation
and
buttery
smooth
feel
to
the
body
light
maltybiscuity
flavor
with
hints
of
spice
and
butter
and
a
nice
bitter
hoppy
dry
finish
a
great
pilsner
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
very
refreshing
and
extremely
drinkable
the
22oz
bottle
did
not
last
long
that
sort
of
knocks
down
the
final
3
grades
d
if
i
was
stranded
on
a
desert
island
and
i
could
only
have
three
things
completely
refreshing
with
a
dry
finish
bravo
an
excellent
delicate
tasting
and
smelling
beer
the
noble
hops
reign
supreme
clearly
a
great
tasting
summer
beer
but
just
as
much
yearround
really
appreciate
the
cleanness
of
the
malt
character
nice
crisp
really
refreshing
if
this
beer
had
the
right
chance
it
could
turn
the
tide
of
all
those
bmc
drinkers
the
beer
is
distinctly
a
pilsner
but
exudes
a
majestic
and
sophisticated
construct
that
sets
it
in
a
class
of
its
own
brilliant
work
phenomenal
beer
to
pair
with
a
wide
variety
of
light
fare
wow
how
has
it
taken
me
so
long
to
drink
and
review
this
beer
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
is
faint
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
these
pilsners
comprising
only
some
wheat
and
light
florals
the
taste
follows
a
bit
stronger
with
notes
of
floral
and
citrus
peel
bitters
and
a
very
light
background
bit
o
biscuits
the
body
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
solid
pils
but
nothing
to
get
all
that
uppity
about
drinkability
a
faithful
interpretation
of
a
german
style
wellbalanced
and
enjoyable
definitely
a
beer
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
again
highly
sessionable
perfectly
clear
pale
straw
color
appearance
with
a
nice
white
1
5
finger
head
minimal
dot
sized
lacing
smells
mostly
of
grains
and
a
hint
of
alcohol
i
love
the
taste
of
this
beer
the
grains
from
the
nose
carry
over
nicely
to
the
palate
very
smooth
and
clean
going
down
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bite
on
the
backend
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
this
is
infinitely
drinkable
and
one
of
the
best
pilseners
i
have
ever
tasted
this
lives
up
to
the
hype
great
warm
weather
quaffer
you
just
cant
deny
how
easy
this
is
to
drink
it
might
be
one
of
the
most
drinkable
beers
on
the
planet
and
it
has
definitely
provoked
an
interest
in
the
style
pours
a
clear
golden
pear
with
a
frothy
white
head
a
subtly
hoppy
aroma
with
a
little
hint
of
fresh
citrus
flavor
is
at
first
distinctly
hoppy
albeit
light
hops
and
fresh
later
notes
of
slight
malt
and
some
very
light
citrus
flower
develop
very
clean
very
light
a
refined
palate
champaignesque
in
some
ways
this
is
the
best
pilsener
ive
had
so
far
has
a
crisp
lighter
mouthfeel
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
a
very
tasty
summer
beer
a
wonderful
session
beer
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
multiples
of
this
that
being
said
this
is
delicious
prima
pils
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
an
average
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
bit
and
laces
nicely
on
the
pilsner
glass
the
flavors
are
crisp
and
consist
of
citrus
and
pine
the
hops
are
obviously
dominant
in
the
flavors
although
a
bit
of
light
malt
comes
through
definitely
a
great
pilsner
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
this
is
up
there
with
voodoos
pilzilla
and
oskar
blues
little
yella
pils
the
2
other
pilsners
that
i
can
actually
drink
and
enjoy
sorry
for
the
lame
review
as
i
have
the
hardest
time
reviewing
pilseners
due
to
there
subtle
but
great
flavors
very
well
put
together
pilsner
with
an
added
dimension
from
the
amount
of
hops
really
enjoyed
this
beer
and
will
be
seeking
it
out
in
the
future
overall
this
is
a
style
of
beer
that
i
can
get
down
with
a
wellfocused
and
roided
up
pilsner
definitely
something
i
would
take
home
again
and
again
12
oz
bottle

the
first

worried
me
i
thought
it
was
a
little
lite
like
a
typical

i
have
a
lot
to
say
about
this
beer
first
of
all
it
has
all
the
flavor
that
a
wellbuilt
pils
should
exhibit
just
a
hint
of
malt
and
hops
its
the
crispness
that
stands
out
its
a

a
reasonable

of

to

keep
exploring

honestly
you
get
hints
of

the
taste
is

be
completely
thoughtless
yet
packed
with
indescribable
nuances
this
stuff
cleans
itself
up
color
to
style
with
a
nice
nose
but
not
overwhelming
then
the
taste
clean
and
crisp
with
the
nicest
little
hop
punch
to
it
one
of
my
alltime
favorites
over
all
the
finish
was
a
bit
dry
and
the
carbonation
was
prohibitive
presentation
packaged
in
a
twelve
ounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
pilsener
glass
aroma
is
slightly
sulpher
tinged
and
sharp
with
hops
lemonade
yellow
with
a
huge
three
finger
thick
head
that
is
frothy
and
bubbly
fore
is
grainymalty
with
a
lot
of
sweetness
from
that
malt
hop
profile
is
lower
than
i
thought
it
would
be
definitely
a
great
warm
weather
beer
here
as
it
is
quite
quenching
overall
a
nice
strong
presence
of
hops
in
a
beer
thats
lighter
crisper
and
more
approachable
than
a
big
ipa
for
a
maltlover
like
myself
these
arent
the
citrusgrapefruit
hop
flavors
so
loved
by
many
american
brewers
these
are
the
hops
of
a
classic
european
pilsner
punched
up
a
few
notches
though
not
exactly
smooth
in
my
book
its
relatively
drinkable
overall
this
is
a
great
beer
for
almost
any
occasion
one
of
the
most
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
beers
ive
come
across
all
in
all
this
is
better
than
most
every
other
american
pilsner
youll
find
on
the
market
there
are
better
from
overseas
but
this
one
is
quite
nice
imo
another
great
beer
from
victory
go
pick
this
one
up
clear
pale
golden
straw
with
a
shortlived
pristine
white
head
pungent
noble
hop
aromas
grassy
and
sulfuric
spot
on
for
the
style
grassy
hop
flavor
thats
definitely
a
cut
above
most
pilsners
smooth
malt
presence
but
this
one
is
all
about
european
lupulin
crisp
clean
mouthfeel
quenching
and
quite
drinkable
not
my
favorite
style
but
when
the
mood
strikes
this
is
the
one
to
seek
out
12
oz
brown
bottle
poured
into
a
mug
this
beer
poured
an
almost
highlighterstyle
clear
yellow
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
no
lace
the
smell
was
really
bad
a
very
bad
skunky
grassy
smell
with
just
an
over
powering
of
skunkiness
the
taste
was
very
disspleasing
i
dont
know
to
how
to
describe
the
taste
except
as
a
more
hoppier
version
of
heineken
i
had
a
high
expectation
to
try
this
brew
but
was
very
dissapointed
maybe
i
just
had
a
bad
batchhopefully
come
on
victory
i
wont
buy
this
again
though
drinkability
is
great
this
stuff
goes
down
like
magic
will
probably
be
a
summer
favorite
for
me
this
year
well
done
victory
heavy
carbonation
with
a
light
mouthfeel
crisply
bitter
taste
with
an
overall
refreshing
taste
simple
straightforward
pilsner
somewhat
boring
not
even
close
to
as
good
as
victorys
others
clear
pale
yellow
in
color
bright
white
half
inch
head
lots
of
carbonation
with
some
quick
fading
lacing
smells
of
malts
and
hops
also
a
strong
aroma
of
yeast
and
bread
there
is
a
slight
hint
of
fruit
maybe
banana
great
well
balanced
taste
lots
of
malts
up
front
finishes
dry
with
some
hoppy
bitterness
full
bodied
mouthfeel
but
not
fizzy
easy
drinking
pilsner
with
a
low
abv
to
make
for
a
good
session
beer
i
would
enjoy
this
more
during
the
summer
months
verdict
a
very
tasty
wellhopped
pilsner
close
to
perfect
poured
a
clear
pale
gold
duh
it
is
a
pilsener
with
nice
carbonation
and
head
hops
really
shine
in
this
one
nice
floral
earthy
aroma
very
pleasing
bitterness
of
the
hops
shines
but
there
is
a
mild
faint
sweetness
that
comes
through
which
is
hard
to
place
very
clean
and
fresh
on
the
palate
with
a
slightly
dry
feel
very
drinkable
but
most
of
all
really
enjoyable
cheers
this
and
im
relatively
new
to
the
category
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
and
was
overall
a
disappointment
not
nearly
victorys
greatest
drinkability
a
great
if
somewhat
overhopped
pils
for
a
cold
summer
drink
i
cant
think
of
anything
else
id
rather
have
in
my
hand
mouthfeel
is
nice
for
the
style
but
may
be
a
tad
thin
also
the
carbonation
fizzled
a
bit
quicker
than
id
prefer
overall
incredibly
drinkable
this
is
the
beer
that
could
convert
bud
and
coors
drinkers
to
craft
beer
finally
my
local
grocery
store
carries
this
probably
for
a
limited
time
12
oz
bottle
awesome
hoppygreen
labellove
their
design
first
of
all
99
of
the
pilseners
i
have
had
i
have
hated
so
lets
see
what
happens
with
this
much
loved
brew
this
poured
a
light
yellow
gold
color
with
a
nice
but
small
white
head
mediocre
lacing
awesome
stringing
of
tiny
bubbles
the
smell
is
not
the
most
impressive
to
me
sweet
yet
simple
hops
clean
this
has
some
nice
yet
very
light
and
sharp
hop
flavor
tastier
than
most
pilsners
i
have
had
by
far
but
it
certainly
tastes
very
euro
this
is
drinkable
but
i
would
take
brooklyns
pilsener
over
this
any
day
it
tastes
similar
to
ass
macro
pilseners
its
just
that
you
can
tell
more
time
and
better
ingredients
into
it
because
there
are
no
disgusting
chemical
aftertastes
but
still
as
as
smf
said
below
this
is
a
functional
beer
at
this
price
i
am
looking
for
more
than
functional
average
to
me
not
quite
as
good
as
i
had
hoped
but
i
had
built
this
up
in
my
own
mind
a
lot
being
two
months
past
its
enjoy
by
date
may
have
affected
the
aroma
slightly
but
i
doubt
too
much
one
of
only
a
few
lagers
i
have
had
the
last
couple
of
weeks
but
a
good
one
excellent
made
me
like
pilsners
again
recommended
again
specially
after
warming
familiar
german
malt
smell
that
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
otherwise
clean
easy
drinking
showcase
for
the
spicing
hops
detectable
quality
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
but
i
dont
understand
why
it
is
rated
as
high
as
it
is
by
others
hops
are
too
strong
way
overblown
and
out
of
balance
prima
pils
is
golden
with
good
carbonation
head
is
mediumsized
and
fluffy
the
aroma
is
of
grain
and
herbal
hop
wow
the
taste
is
hoppier
than
expected
very
herbal
and
bitter
grainy
malt
is
there
but
hops
are
the
focus
my
overall
impression
of
this
is
similar
to
victorys
hopdevil
the
hop
bitterness
takes
a
bit
much
from
the
flavor
for
my
tastes
ill
probably
try
this
again
to
see
if
i
can
figure
out
what
the
fuss
is
about
cheers
drinkability
very
drinkable
this
is
a
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
beer
probably
the
most
drinkable
ive
ever
had
i
had
four
of
these
right
in
a
row
of
each
other
last
night
and
thats
something
that
i
rarely
care
to
do
i
look
forward
to
drinking
this
on
a
hot
summer
night
after
riding
around
town
on
my
bike
taste
slightly
biscuity
malts
with
some
piney
hops
with
a
bit
of
spiciness
in
the
finish
and
just
a
little
bit
bitter
mouthfeel
is
light
and
just
slightly
oily
prima
pils
went
down
very
easy
my
glass
was
empty
before
i
knew
it
this
is
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
still
found
this
to
be
rather
enjoyable
flavor
is
a
perfect
balance
of
sweet
smoothness
and
spicy
bitterness
a
very
substantial
herbal
spicy
hop
flavor
is
contrasted
by
a
smooth
malty
sweetness
this
is
the
first
victory
brew
ive
tried
and
i
am
very
impressed
i
poured
this
beer
from
a
12
ounce
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
it
is
one
of
the
few
pilsners
that
i
have
had
appearance
is
faint
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
that
disappears
rapidly
there
is
little
to
no
lacing
the
smell
is
flowery
hops
the
hops
are
the
first
thing
that
hit
you
when
you
taste
it
but
quickly
fade
to
reveal
biscuity
malts
as
it
warms
the
hop
flavor
becomes
dominated
by
the
bready
malts
this
beer
feels
a
little
dry
in
the
mouth
but
it
is
still
somewhat
smooth
its
drinkability
is
great
i
could
kill
a
bunch
of
this
in
one
night
but
i
wouldnt
necessarily
always
have
this
on
hand
drinkability
exceedingly
drinkable
this
beers
smoothness
and
moderate
alcohol
content
make
it
an
excellent
candidate
for
session
beer
status
pours
a
clear
macrolooking
yellow
with
a
nice
lasting
fluffy
head
i
got
biscuts
fruitscitrus
and
floral
aromas
in
the
nose
very
pleasent
the
taste
kind
of
suprised
me
it
was
much
more
hoppy
than
i
was
expecting
kind
of
a
fruity
and
grassy
taste
with
some
very
well
defined
hop
character
feels
kind
of
thin
and
overly
carbonated
in
the
mouth
you
could
easily
throw
a
few
of
these
down
while
watching
a
football
game
im
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
i
will
continue
to
drink
victorys
prima
pils
i
think
as
a
pilsener
this
ones
definately
stands
its
ground
and
pilsener
fans
would
delite
drinkability
is
good
nice
light
but
lots
of
flavor
make
a
great
lawn
mower
beer
i
can
drink
this
everyday
and
twice
on
sunday
such
a
delicious
beer
with
an
abv
that
allows
you
to
consume
several
without
a
worry
pilsner
lovers
need
to
try
this
beer
drinkability
pilsners
are
not
my
normal
brew
of
choice
i
dam
bmc
and
the
like
for
my
pilsner
distaste
i
am
looking
forward
to
this
pilsner
and
a
few
others
when
summer
comes
this
is
a
very
thin
light
bodied
beer
it
poured
out
with
a
decent
head
the
color
is
a
cloudy
light
straw
shade
the
smell
is
not
much
different
than
a
macro
the
taste
is
extremely
watered
down
you
can
detect
a
very
slight
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
edge
of
revolting
the
drinkability
could
not
be
very
high
a
brewer
such
as
victory
just
plain
out
missed
the
mark
with
this
beer
prima
pils
has
now
become
my
favorite
pilsner
for
sure
poured
out
crisp
clear
gold
with
a
big
head
the
smell
of
floral
hops
and
maybe
some
grapefruit
had
just
the
right
carbonation
and
didnt
go
flat
right
away
the
taste
was
bitter
sweet
some
honey
and
citrice
very
good
served
very
cold
mouthfeel
was
nice
sharp
and
crisp
a
great
refreshing
drink
pours
a
golden
yellow
head
disappears
quickly
lots
of
carbination
not
much
lacing
smell
was
very
hoppyand
floral
mouthfeel
is
light
for
me
this
taste
was
way
too
hoppy
bitter
from
start
to
finish
if
you
like
a
lightbitter
beer
try
it
if
not
dont
bother
a
good
pilsner
although
i
find
it
a
little
bland
a
little
more
showing
from
the
hops
would
have
convinced
me
more
a
good
selection
to
pair
with
lighter
dishes
seafood
or
pasta
for
a
domestic
example
i
prefer
brooklyn
pils
over
this
a
wellbuilt
pilsner
the
amped
up
hops
is
a
nice
addition
and
isnt
so
overwhelming
as
to
throw
it
off
kilter
or
too
far
out
of
style
refreshing
and
drinkable
pours
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
substantial
white
fluffy
head
it
sticks
well
and
leaves
lacing
all
over
the
place
the
smell
is
slightly
bready
with
substantial
spice
and
lemon
notes
upfront
the
taste
is
full
and
bready
then
gives
way
to
an
unbelievable
crispness
of
spicy
hops
less
lemon
and
a
substantial
herbal
tealike
quality
it
dries
out
terrifically
through
the
finish
with
only
a
slight
lingering
bitterness
and
the
enormous
urge
to
sip
again
mouthfeel
is
quite
full
for
a
pils
and
carbonated
perfectly
in
my
mind
that
meaning
a
bit
less
than
some
other
examples
of
the
style
session
beer
number
1
notes
crisp
refreshing
smooth
balanced
this
pils
is
stronger
on
the
hops
that
other
pils
ive
had
and
it
is
great
it
has
a
nice
balance
with
good
hop
flavor
and
moderately
strong
bitterness
whoa
this
beer
is
going
to
be
hard
to
keep
in
the
fridge
because
it
is
just
so
tasty
i
had
to
try
this
beer
again
to
make
sure
i
was
reading
it
right
plus
it
is
very
drinkable
and
really
makes
me
respect
pilsners
again
thank
you
victory
for
changing
my
mind
on
the
way
americans
do
pilsners
the
taste
was
a
thorough
cleansing
of
the
postturkey
palate
that
was
both
enjoyable
and
easy
going
down

would

another
very

job
by
victory
would
definitely
recommend
overall
a
very
good
beer
for
what
victory
was
apparently
shooting
for
a
hoppy
pilsner
not
bad
at
all
poured

white
frothy

finish
light
and
refreshing
good
to
have
with
food
as
there
are
no
overpowering
flavours
certainly
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
i
prefer
the
czech
pilsners
much
more
my
first
victory
beer
and
i
found
it
very
enjoyable
look
forward
to
trying
their
other
beers
d
definitley
a
session
beer
for
anytime
of
the
year
a
golden
beauty
with
very
minimal
head
that
remains
for
just
a
few
seconds
excellent
carbonation
that
gives
the
impression
of
champagne
aromas
of
yeast
malt
grains
and
hops
the
taste
is
an
excellent
example
of
this
style
with
its
crisp
bitter
taste
upfront
followed
by
a
dry
finish
hop
bitterness
dominates
the
malt
but
both
flavors
are
detectable
the
carbonation
simply
addes
to
the
dry
hop
profile
the
aftertaste
is
quite
bitter
but
not
unpleasant
or
overly
dominant
a
refreshing
beer
with
good
taste
i
can
easily
have
a
few
of
these
bright
goldenyellow
beer
perfectly
transparent
with
lots
of
carbonation
smells
sweet
malty
with
some
piney
hops
it
is
a
little
sour
smelling
it
really
smells
like
a
pilsner
not
much
more
to
it
the
hops
hit
you
first
quite
piney
the
sweet
malts
take
over
at
the
end
it
is
a
straightforward
beer
and
well
balanced
a
little
astringent
but
not
in
anyway
that
takes
away
from
the
beer
light
to
medium
body
very
drinkable
everything
about
the
beer
makes
me
want
to
take
another
drink
drinkability
indeed
very
drinkable
im
surprised
by
how
much
i
like
this
beer
i
pretty
much
wroteoff
the
pilsner
style
as
being
boring
boy
was
i
wrong
i
can
see
myself
drinking
a
few
of
these
every
so
often
i
will
be
coming
back
to
this
beer
very
soon
prima
pils
is
always
in
my
fridge
after
seeing
this
beer
on
several
top
pilsner
lists
i
finally
found
it
at
my
local
market
after
taking
my
first
sip
i
realized
why
pours
a
hazy
but
bright
straw
yellow
this
tells
me
this
beer
has
not
been
refined
over
and
over
just
to
make
it
clear
like
budwieser
or
miller
lite
nice
white
head
that
fades
quickly
but
leaves
traces
of
its
self
all
down
the
glass
crisp
and
clean
this
beer
bites
your
tongue
with
a
nice
hoppy
edge
but
not
overdone
so
refreshing
and
drinkable
floral
hops
blend
well
with
malt
character
i
wont
often
say
this
but
this
is
better
than
almost
every
pilsner
i
ever
drank
in
germany
and
eastern
europe
you
have
to
praise
the
guys
at
victory
and
all
great
freethinking
american
brewers
who
never
limit
themselves
prost
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
drinkable
a
good
attempt
at
an
aggressive
pilsner
for
a
us
brewer
but
id
still
prefer
the
czech
versions
from
the
bottle
was
sitting
at
the
bar
at
kuhnhenns
when
brett
brought
this
over
to
me
poured
a
yellow
with
white

aroma
wheat

asome
sourness
hop
and
some
malt
flavor
hops
malts
grainy
as
it
warmed
got
honey
and

mouthfeel
was
dry
would
be
a
good

mouth
feel

and
highly
carbonated
opinion
now
this
is
an
anomaly
of
beer
in
my
opinion
it
definitely
has
the
malt
presence
of
a
true
pilsner
beer
while
the
hops
is
probably
more
assertive
than
the
most
hoppy
northern
german
pilsner
that
i
have
tried
if
i
were
to
guess
this
is
pretty
close
to
a
hopped
up
version
of
jever
pils
yet
jever
has
a
bit
more
sweet
balance
in
the
finish
this
is
still
a
mighty
fine
beer
overall
impression
a
quality
pilsner
in
the
style
of
urquell
but
with
a
bit
more
assertive
hop
presence
for
all
the
bitter
it
doesnt
pucker
i
think
the
carbonation
is
a
touch
high
and
the
transparent
appearance
kind
of
throws
me
a
bit
but
a
quality
beer
none
the
less
i
cant
see
this
being
a
session
beer
its
scratching
my
beer
itch
pretty
quickly
youll
know
if
youll
like
it
before
you
taste
it
the
smell
is
that
strong
and
distinct
grainy
flavors
a
hops
smack
stonger
and
sharper
than
just
about
any
pils
youve
tried
some
subtle
hints
of
sweet
and
tart
fruit
this
is
highly
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
youll
want
to
have
more
not
in
the
bogus
sense
that
its
so
ahem
bland
that
it
doesnt
put
up
any
fight
going
down
this
beer
is
soft
and
light
on
the
palate
but
its
also
interesting
and
for
real
for
real
probably
my
favorite
pils
if
you
have
macroswilling
friends
this
might
be
a
good
crossover
beer
to
shove
down
their
naive
palates
or
it
might
just
be
more
than
they
can
handle
pours
a
clear
light
straw
with
a
big
thick
white
head
and
excellent
lacing
smell
is
herbal
hops
and
grassy
with
some
lemon
notes
tastes
very
hoppy
mostly
herbal
but
with
some
spiciness
however
there
is
also
enough
bready
malt
to
provide
some
balance
this
beer
has
a
very
nice
clean
but
substantial
mouthfeel
very
nicely
carbonated
with
a
dry
finish
very
drinkable
overall
awesome
pils
easily
the
best
ive
had
of
the
style
d
outstanding
i
will
definitely
come
back
to
this
easily
my
favorite
in
the
pilsner
category
straw
yellow
and
brilliantly
clear
with
a
fluffy
white
head
great
lacing
and
excellent
head
retention
crisp
aroma
with
spicy
saaz
fresh
floral
hops
and
a
bit
of
lemon
sitting
on
top
of
light
pils
malt
sweetness
malty
sweetness
just
balances
out
contributions
from
the
hops
theres
an
oily
hop
bitterness
thats
quite
forward
and
carries
through
the
finish
hop
flavour
is
citric
and
floral
with
just
a
hint
of
spiciness
that
kicks
in
towards
the
end
light
body
with
moderately
high
carbonation
but
this
beer
doesnt
come
close
to
feeling
watery
the
texture
is
a
bit
slick
and
theres
just
a
little
residual
sweetness
that
keeps
the
finish
from
drying
out
too
much
this
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
packed
with
hops
definitely
my
kind
of
pilsner
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
ever
had
this
is
almost
a
perfect
session
beer
this
is
a
very
fine
beer
for
enjoying
with
food
because
of
its
dryness
i
havent
had
this
one
repeatedly
but
it
seems
to
be
an
ideal
session
beer
the
best
pilsener
ive
tried
yet
cant
wait
to
try
it
on
tap
straw
colored
with
a
fine
white
head
classic
pils
aroma
with
hints
of
hay
and
pale
biscuity
malts
soft
grassy
saaz
nose
becomes
slightly
doughy
with
hints
of
flowery
honey
and
white
toast
staying
perfectly
crisp
throughout
maybe
a
tad
fizzy
when
cold
clean
finish
really
refreshing
a
nice
american
alternative
to
bitburger
pils
but
a
little
more
robust
and
flavorful
in
a
good
way
outstanding
drinkability
i
could
drink
this
all
the
time
except
there
was
only
one
case
of
this
at
the
pasadena
bevmo
smooth
bubbly
and
delicious
this
is
an
awesome
pils
and
is
extraordinarily
drinkable
a
great
beer
from
victory
now
i
know
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
poured
out
to
a
light
gold
color
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
nice
white
foamy
head
looks
like
the
proverbial
beer
you
see
in
cartoons
and
on
tv
aromas
of
hops
malt
and
sweet
earthiness
fills
the
nose
very
nice
taste
is
delectible
hops
malt
sweet
spices
citrus
and
floral
notes
fill
the
palate
all
the
while
remaining
smooth
and
crips
light
mouthfeel
is
refreshing
and
smooth
a
high
level
of
drinkability
is
found
here
as
this
brew
could
easily
be
a
session
beer
or
a
cross
over
point
for
many
macro
drinkers
to
see
the
light
of
day
in
a
craft
brew
world
highly
recommended
drinkability
this
is
a
good
pils
but
i
had
heard
so
much
about
this
beer
i
am
kind
of
disappointed
the
maltiness
is
full
and
crisp
as
expected
from
a
pils
with
a
nice
hop
flavor
certainly
nothing
to
complain
about
but
i
expected
more
from
the
number
one
rated
beer
for
the
style
as
of
today
highly
reccomended
pils
and
at
a
fair
price
for
this
much
quality
pours
out
to
a
sparkling
clear
pale
straw
golden
forming
a
soft
white
head
with
good
retention
and
lacing
carbonation
is
moderatestrong
mouthfeel
is
zippy
yet
smooth
and
finished
with
a
slight
astringency
making
this
one
very
easy
to
drink
the
aroma
is
very
soft
with
a
traditional
saaz
nose
freshly
mown
hay
and
delicate
pale
malts
the
taste
is
initially
floral
and
spicy
with
saaz
followed
by
a
subtle
grainy
pale
malt
body
nicely
balanced
with
a
moderate
bitterness
the
aftertaste
is
bittersweet
and
haunted
by
spicy
hop
overtones
very
flavorful
and
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
delicious
drinkability
one
fantastic
pilsener
my
favorite
example
of
the
style
a
great
golden
colora
full
three
finger
head
best
looking
pilsner
ive
seen
a
great
dry
hoppy
tastevery
dryvery
clear
with
lots
of
bubbles
if
distribution
was
larger
it
would
mean
the
end
of
the
large
macro
beers
a
great
pilsner
from
one
of
my
favorite
brewers
rucksicht
bier
slàinte
retried
on
tap
at
the
gingerman
nyc
and
i
was
very
impressed
once
again
by
the
fragrant
hoppiness
of
that
one
bottles
dont
keep
their
freshness
very
long
but
this
particular
pint
was
vibrant
with
floral
herbal
spicy
hops
that
overcame
the
soft
biscuity
malts
immensely
dry
and
satisfying
to
me
hence
the
score
bumping
up
pours
almost
clear
very
pale
gold
out
of
bottle
not
much
head
it
goes
away
very
quickly
nice
aroma
that
reminds
of
pilsner
urqel
sorry
for
the
spelling
first
sip
reveals
a
nice
smooth
lager
with
some
hops
bitterness
detectable
a
bit
of
meat
on
this
pilsner
not
like
a
watery
lager
it
could
use
a
little
more
malt
taste
a
fine
alternative
to
czech
pilsners
that
dont
survive
the
trip
over
the
seas
not
only
did
i
sample
this
as
soon
as
i
could
per
nc
oh
and
pop
the
cap
was
still
in
effect
i
picked
some
up
for
later
a
great
example
of
a
pilsner
or
at
least
a
pilsner
on
vacation
in
america
overall
what
a
great
beer
this
one
of
my
overall
faves
the
1st
time
i
had
a
prima
i
didnt
really
care
for
it
however
its
now
one
that
i
enjoy
year
round
very
crisp
and
clean
extremly
sessionable
dont
limit
yourself
to
drinking
this
fine
pils
only
when
its
hot
its
a
damn
good
beer
anytime
of
the
year
another
staple
of
my
beer
fridge
one
of
the
few
micro
pilsners
that
i
found
most
enjoyable
pours
light
and
golden
with
a
bright
white
two
finger
head
that
lingers
around
for
quite
a
while
i
did
not
notice
much
of
a
nose
with
the
exception
of
a
light
hop
aroma
taste
is
bright
crisp
and
clean
with
a
great
hop
backbone
and
hints
of
malt
body
is
light
with
a
long
hoppy
finish
a
great
brew
from
victory
and
a
great
session
beer
a
favorite
of
mine
for
a
hot
summer
day
prima
pils
produces
a
nice
finger
and
a
half
head
of
eggshell
foam
pristine
and
golden
the
head
fades
leaving
a
ring
and
lace
that
clings
sporadically
along
the
glass
smell
is
faint
with
hints
of
hay
and
apple
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
carbonation
and
dry
taste
is
light
toast
and
biscuit
malts
a
tiny
bit
nutty
with
a
light
but
lasting
hop
finish
drinkability
is
amazing
the
most
refreshing
beer
ive
ever
had
i
could
see
myself
sucking
down
a
case
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
night
its
the
perfect
summer
beer
and
what
any
pilsner
should
aspire
to
be
overall
the
hops
and
the
malt
are
in
great
balance
and
in
large
quantity
again
this
is
the
pilsner
that
all
other
should
be
judged
by
taste
is
that
of
a
real
solid
gold
colored
beer
nothing
fancy
here
just
clean
malt
with
some
more
pilsener
hops
there
is
a
slightly
skunky
character
but
it
is
very
subdued
it
does
have
a
lemony
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
tingly
a
little
on
the
sour
side
but
pleasant
extremely
drinkable
beer
seems
like
it
would
be
very
versatile
for
pairing
with
food
i
think
i
may
actually
prefer
the
bottled
version
on
this
one
but
this
draught
is
quite
good
too
i
would
love
to
have
better
access
to
this
beer
i
would
always
have
some
handy
for
a
hot
summer
sunday
body
and
drinkability
great
on
both
counts
the
body
is
light
without
being
thin
and
really
there
is
nothing
about
this
beer
to
get
tired
of
overall
an
outstanding
beer
and
by
far
my
favorite
pilsner
would
fit
very
well
on
a
hot
summer
bbq
or
any
warm
day
when
youre
quite
thirsty
id
never
turn
on
down
and
highly
recommend
you
try
it
overall
a
splendid
rendition
of
a
very
difficult
style
to
nail
i
adore
the
hoppedup
approach
this
beer
is
noted
for
the
awesome
balance
of
the
drynesstosweetness
is
unmatched
the
only
thing
im
not
happy
with
is
that
its
taken
me
so
long
to
get
my
hands
on
some
move
over
sierra
summerfest
and
dortmunder
gold
prima
is
taking
the
top
bunk
i
have
yet
to
have
anything
else
like
it
no
aftertaste
at
all
clean
pronounced
hop
flavor
and
superb
drinkability
a
very
good
sixer
why
arent
all
pilsners
this
good
i
havent
had
any
truly
german
pilsners
other
than
old
german
which
this
it
is
not
bitter
just
a
bit
with
rounded
grainy
flavors
and
made
this
better
than
anything
you
buy
from
bmc
or
even
some
micros
again
this
is
not
my
preference
in
beer
types
but
if
i
want
something
light
with
a
lot
of
flavor
ill
look
for
this
gorgeous
golden
colorpositvely
flawless
in
appearance
low
carbonation
level
low
aroma
some
sweet
malt
almost
a
trace
of
citrus
good
malty
flavorvery
clean
tasting
slight
hop
bitterness
to
round
out
the
whole
thing
smooth
bodyhas
that
soft
creaminess
you
find
in
a
great
pils
very
drinkable
dont
know
why
i
hadnt
tried
this
one
from
victory
yet
damn
good
beer
pours
a
medium
light
gold
with
a
huge
head
great
longevity
and
great
lace
smells
of
a
sweet
malt
with
a
spicy
hop
presence
exactly
how
a
pilsner
should
smell
a
sweet
malt
first
hits
fllowed
by
a
spicy
earthy
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
a
bit
to
hoppy
i
think
a
bit
out
of
balance
i
realize
that
they
are
supposed
to
be
a
bit
hoppy
but
its
just
a
too
much
for
me
upon
a
second
sip
i
detect
some
citrus
and
grassy
flavors
a
excellent
example
of
the
pilsner
style
but
just
a
bit
too
hoppy
in
my
opinion
still
a
quality
and
tasty
beer
though
light
golden
yellow
color
with
a
big
foamy
head
great
looking
lacing
and
head
retention
smells
nice
and
hoppy
a
banquet
of
spicy
of
floral
hops
hit
the
nose
with
a
bready
malt
in
the
background
the
taste
is
absolutly
delicious
spiced
with
hops
to
perfection
pine
like
bitterness
hits
the
tounge
first
and
then
evens
out
to
a
softer
floral
flavor
its
like
the
hops
are
in
a
tugawar
with
the
malts
because
the
malts
are
trying
to
keep
the
hops
in
check
dry
hoppy
finish
smooth
medium
body
and
perfect
drinkabilty
damn
this
is
good
drinking
i
love
a
great
pilsner
during
the
summer
time
but
this
one
threw
me
off
guard
true
to
the
style
but
a
lot
hoppier
this
could
be
one
of
the
most
delicious
pilsners
i
have
had
awesome
pilsner
has
no
equal
on
this
side
of
the
pond
a
nice
change
of
pace
and
a
perfect
summertime
brew
the
smell
is
somewhat
floral
with
light
malts
underneath
the
taste
is
quite
good
being
light
yet
full
of
flavor
hops
come
through
in
a
solid
fashion
but
do
not
disrupt
the
rest
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
pleasing
while
the
drinkability
is
very
high
my
bottles
says
enjoy
by
4205
but
ive
been
drinking
them
and
they
taste
fine
to
me
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quickly
to
a
ring
nose
is
pretty
hoppyboth
floral
and
citrus
coming
through
over
a
sweet
malt
taste
is
a
refreshing
light
malt
with
an
aggressive
grassy
hop
finish
with
some
caramel
and
lemon
notes
coming
through
here
and
there
bitterness
lingers
for
a
while
after
each
sip
medium
bodied
this
beer
has
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
this
is
definitely
one
of
the
better
tasting
pilsners
ive
had
especially
for
hopheads
victory
prima
pils
12
oz
bottle
opened
with
a
smooth
hiss
and
not
too
much
carbonation
the
poor
was
even
and
left
a
good
head
the
head
fell
quickly
but
settled
leaving
about
a
38
cap
that
lasted
through
the
whole
glass
the
brew
had
a
light
straw
color
and
a
clarity
that
could
only
be
attained
through
filtration
a
hefty
amount
of
saaz
was
detected
in
the
nose
likely
from
dry
hopping
and
this
german
pilsner
also
had
a
liberal
amount
of
hops
in
the
taste
i
am
happy
over
all
with
this
brew
it
pours
clean
has
enough
head
to
keep
its
carbonation
and
has
a
good
serving
of
saaz
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
truth
be
told
i
usually
dont
like
pilsners
very
much
but
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
excellent
example
of
the
style
victory
prima
pils
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
in
my
pilsener
glass
small
bubbles
continue
to
rise
through
the
beer
as
i
drink
aroma
is
hoppy

spicy

very
crisp

is
light

with
an
amazingly
refreshing
crisp
dry
hoppy
finish
perfectly
balanced
light
mouthfeel
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
in
my
opinion
prima
pils
could
define
the
style
this
pils
pours
a
fairly
small
head
maybe
about
5
to
1
finger
the
head
does
leave
traces
throughout
the
whole
drinking
experience
the
color
is
pale
and
golden
quite
clear
the
smell
is
defintely
floral
hops
with
a
hint
of
malt
the
taste
is
similar
semi
sweet
malt
with
a
good
amount
of
floral
hops
there
is
also
a
very
slight
citrus
taste
the
hops
are
strong
and
the
flavor
is
somewhat
bitter
the
mouthfeel

drinkable
are
strong
and
enjoyable
pours
very
pale
gold
in
color
with
a
nice
foamy

a
very
pleasant
floral
aroma
taste
is
nice
and
hoppystrange
for
a
pilsener
the
malts
come
through
as
sweet
but
then
the
tongue
is
quickly
surrounded
by
hops
slight
metallic
tinge
too
but
not
bad
at
all
it
is
just
present
the
hops
kind
of
surround
the
taste
buds
after
a
while
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp

full
of

very
drinkable
and
hard
to
put
down

an
extremely
clear
pale

a
bit
of

that
disappears
rather
quickly
smells

mostly
herbaly

a
crisp
dry
hoppy

slightly
bitter

mostly
hops

and
i
kind
of
like
it
that
way
mouthfeel
is
good
and
bubbly
a
very
full
taste
and
feel
all
in
all
quite
refreshing
and
light
andy
the
pils
for
the
beer
snob
having
a
pool
party
very
good
on
a
hot
sunny
day
being
lazy
by
the
pool
ill
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
this
during
these
summer
months
the
mouthfeel
is
once
again
quite
crisp
the
hops
have
quite
the
spicy
bite
and
dry
bitterness
very
well
done
and
very
highly
drinkable
its
a
shame
i
cant
get
more
of
this
to
share
with
some
of
my
schwagbeer
drinking
friends
thanks
to
gcbrewingco
for
this
as
well
as
several
other
assorted
goodies
from
victory
and
other
brewers
d
downright
poundable
up
to
4
5
drinkability
just
enough
character
to
keep
you
interested
without
making
it
to
loud
it
wont
burn
out
your
tastebuds
and
the
clean
dry
finish
makes
each
sip
call
for
a
another
a
very
good
solid
pilsner
definitely
worth
a
try
12
oz
bottle
provided
by
foolcircle
as
part
of
bif20
pours
a
two
finger
fluffy
nearly
white
head
over
a
crystalclear
light
straw
colored
liquid
smells
of
grassy
and
zinging
hops
saaz
probably
a
gentle
malt
is
also
present
but
way
below
the
floral
of
the
hops
tastes
bitter
hoppy
with
some
zing
to
start
sharp
and
a
bit
of
metallic
the
middle
is
predominently
malt
sweet
with
honey
qualities
perhaps
a
hint
of
caramel
the
ending
is
another
hoppy
burst
a
bit
more
floral
but
still
with
the
metallic
quality
there
may
also
be
some
hallertauer
flatness
in
the
aftertaste
medium
body
mildly
carbonated
and
great
lacing
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
really
nice
beer
and
quite
drinkable
this
poured
with
a
light
head
white
in
tone
which
quickly
dissipated
it
had
a
very
floral
nose
with
a
rather
light
mouthfeel
there
was
a
great
nonoverpowering
hoppiness
in
the
mouth
the
finish
was
very
clean
very
dry
all
in
all
a
very
beautiful
beer
someone
needs
to
remind
me
why
i
used
to
poohpooh
this
beer
i
feel
as
though
i
am
bornagain
it
is
certainly
a
beer
that
could
be
a
session
beer
and
especially
during
the
summertime
take
a
sip
and
you
get
an
immediate
attack
of
herbal
and
citrusy
hops
this
is
a
lot
more
intense
than
any
other
pilsner
ive
had
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
keeps
it
from
becoming
overwhelming
although
i
wouldnt
call
it
balanced
still
remarkably
smooth
and
drinkable
even
though
i
tend
to
be
a
bit
of
a
wuss
when
it
comes
to
the
hops
i
found
this
to
be
a
delicious
beer
that
would
be
suitable
for
damn
near
any
purpose
this
pils
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
persisted
and
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
in
clumps
the
smell
was
dominated
by
hops
with
both
bitter
hops
and
light
floral
hops
together
with
some
malt
the
taste
was
malty
and
hoppy
with
some
floral
hops
and
some
biscuity
maltiness
very
nice
flavor
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
almost
creamy
with
medium
body
and
good
strong
carbonation
especially
upfront
the
aftertaste
was
lightly
hoppy
this
is
a
delicious
session
beer
and
is
perfect
for
the
summer
months
the
hops
are
really
ratcheted
up
on
the
palate
a
very
clean
yet
substantial
bitterness
dominates
there
is
just
enough
malt
to
keep
things
from
getting
coarse
but
that
is
all
the
finish
is
dry
and
crisp
and
the
lemon
peel
hop
elements
linger
for
quite
a
while
as
with
the
nose
a
touch
of
alcohol
finishes
things
off
not
exactly
my
cup
of
tea
but
quality
stuff
nonetheless
a
very
drinkable
beer
that
i
bought
as
a
hot
weather
thirst
quencher
but
i
would
drink
all
year
round
the
only
problem
i
see
with
this
is
my
inability
to
stop
drinking
it
overall
so
easily
drinkable
so
superbly
hopped
easily
my
favorite
beer
by
victory
hope
that
victory
can
get
some
fresh
prima
pils
sent
out
to
the
west
coast
soon
itll
be
a
dbf
staple
if
i
didnt
like
ipas
so
much
this
would
be
my
everyday
beer
not
too
strong
not
too
weak
just
right
a
session
beer
looking
for
a
session
im
hoping
the
lack
of
carbonation
is
a
fluke
this
sample
was
hand
carried
from
the
east
coast
thanks
rapopoda
but
i
doubt
that
could
have
caused
any
problems
im
looking
forward
to
sampling
some
more
prima
pils
in
the
hopes
that
the
next
one
is
more
typically
carbonated
if
so
ill
rerate
to
be
fair
its
a
shame
because
the
taste
was
so
incredible
perhaps
the
hoppiest
pilsner
ive
ever
had
i
swear
that
this
beer
had
slight
green
tinge
to
its
golden
hue
the
aroma
is
wonderfully
spicy
hops
show
themselves
quite
a
bit
in
this
pilsner
but
mostly
in
the
middle
and
in
the
nose
the
bitterness
is
apparent
but
not
as
striking
as
one
might
expect
the
malt
flavor
is
crisp
and
clean
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
body
firm
perhaps
a
bit
fuller
bodied
than
most
german
pilsners
that
this
beer
seems
to
imitate
but
what
more
can
you
ask
for
in
a
microbrewed
pilsner
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
straw
hue
with
a
halfinch
stark
white
head
nice
carbonation
great
nose
of
sharp
floral
grassy
hops
and
crisp
clean
lager
yeast
palate
begins
with
more
of
the
same
then
develops
a
sharper
hoppiness
finish
is
lightly
bitter
with
light
notes
of
citrus
and
black
pepper
medium
body
is
standard
for
a
pilsner
an
excellent
thirstquenching
beer
perfect
fora
warm
june
evening
nice
light
golden
color
and
tons
of
carbonation
bubbles
12
white
foamy
head
that
disipated
a
little
too
quickly
nice
malty
smell
with
a
light
floral
aroma
and
a
grassy
overtone
taste
starts
out
with
a
grassy
and
slight
citrus
note
that
is
followed
by
a
nice
bitterness
for
the
aftertaste
well
balanced
beer
the
bitterness
dosnt
overpower
and
actually
becomes
less
noticable
as
you
finish
the
beer
very
drinkable
beer
especially
25case
will
be
on
my
regular
summer
rotation
very
enjoyable
this
is
an
excellent
choice
for
a
session
brew
or
something
to
have
with
dinner
im
impressed
overall
a
great
pils
which
is
very
easy
drinking
drinkability
is
very
high
abolsutely
thirst
quenching
and
refreshing
definitely
a
bit
of
an
american
twist
on
a
great
style
but
well
worth
seeking
out
however
when
the
sun
is
shining
and
friends
are
in
abundance
as
is
almost
always
the
case
in
the
summer
months
i
make
it
my
business
to
have
a
case
on
hand
fortunately
this
is
readily
available
in
the
area
and
it
cant
be
beat
for
a
truly
rewarding
hot
weather
brew
great
german
pilsner
that
was
only
2
50
a
pnt
last
night
at
the
flying
saucer
in
charlotte
enough
head
and
lacing
and
tons
of
carbonation
that
tickled
the
tongue
smooth
tasting
with
hints
of
honey
and
clove
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
tasting
pilsners
i
can
recall
though
it
could
be
a
session
beer
i
had
this
last
after
a
long
evening
of
tasting
and
took
a
bit
longer
to
finish
keep
cooler
than
room
temperature
all
in
all
im
very
very
happy
that
brixx
added
this
beer
to
their
lineup
d
this
is
a
supremely
drinkable
summertime
pilsener
even
if
the
carbonation
isnt
the
smoothest
i
cant
find
any
reason
not
to
reach
for
another
bottle
even
after
already
having
a
few
nice
job
victory
this
beer
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
large
foamy
egg
white
head
head
recedes
to
a
small
layer
above
the
liquid
not
really
any
lacing
only
a
few
bubbles
rise
to
the
top
smell
is
slightly
hoppy
but
more
grassy
but
in
a
good
way
taste
has
much
more
of
a
hop
precense
than
the
aroma
i
guess
i
might
be
used
to
the
whole
dry
hopping
thing
but
this
doesnt
really
seem
dry
hopped
quite
a
full
body
which
takes
the
main
stage
with
a
nice
herbal
element
hops
are
nicely
noticeable
but
not
stinging
in
any
way
the
spicyness
of
the
hops
work
with
the
rest
of
the
flavors
in
near
perfect
harmony
they
just
work
with
the
rest
of
the
beer
beautifully
finish
has
little
acidity
and
lingers
with
a
hop
bite
great
beer
here
probably
the
best
pils
i
have
ever
had
i
need
to
get
me
some
pilsners
from
germany
and
compare
but
this
is
damn
excellent
pours
a
nice
light
golden
colour
sparkly
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
dissipates
smells
like
sweet
malt
with
a
little
bit
of
up
front
hop
bitterness
its
tasty
sweet
at
the
front
pretty
full
and
malty
and
a
pleasant
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
pretty
full
for
a
pilsner
lots
of
flavour
and
very
enjoyable
probably
one
of
the
best
pilsners
out
there
definately
a
fine
session
beer
another
solid
brew
from
victory
these
guys
continually
impress
me
mouthfeel
is
light
and
airey
yet
maintains
a
full
and
rich
mouthfeel
this
is
a
good
beer
for
any
time
any
place
or
any
occasion
are
all
microbrewed
pilsners
this
good
the
taste
is
great
not
overpowered
by
saaz
like
the
last
time
the
pils
malt
is
complimented
by
some
specialty
the
hop
profile
is
a
mix
of
something
noble
and
something
domestic
tasting
slightly
bitter
but
with
a
perfectly
crisp
compliment
also
very
drinkable
and
excellent
for
beer
light
gold
in
color
with
a
medium
amount
of
carbonation
the
smell
is
fairly
malty
with
a
good
dose
of
floral
hops
the
malt
flavor
in
this
one
is
quite
unique
taking
on
some
wildflower
honey
type
qualities
the
hop
flavors
are
both
grassy
and
floral
and
contribute
a
bracing
bitterness
to
the
mix
id
drink
this
regularly
if
it
were
available
locally
and
its
inspired
me
to
homebrew
a
clone
of
it
sometime
in
the
near
future
light
gold
color
almost
clear
with
a
small
frothy
head
and
good
retention
spicy
hop
aroma
that
gave
it
a
unique
taste
very
light
bodied
and
carbonated
slightly
dry
mouthfeel
and
very
crisp
and
clean
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
but
i
dont
think
this
would
be
my
choice
to
drink
all
night
long
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
and
it
went
very
well
with
the
chili
i
made
for
dinner
but
its
something
i
would
only
want
to
drink
once
in
a
while
not
keep
my
fridge
stocked
with
an
excellent
warm
weather
beer
i
could
drink
these
all
night
and
still
want
more
pours
a
pale
yellow
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
and
it
is
quite
clear
the
smell
is
big
juicy
hops
with
a
spicy
background
seems
like
saaz
hops
and
there
is
a
light
malt
scent
in
the
background
the
taste
is
also
dominated
by
hops
you
get
a
resiny
hop
oil
flavor
as
well
as
a
citrusy
tartness
to
it
the
saaz
hops
really
make
themselves
felt
with
a
spicy
middle
followed
by
a
biscuity
malt
flavor
to
balance
the
finish
the
finish
is
dry
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
like
a
pilsner
should
be
this
is
a
great
summertime
brew
and
im
glad
its
available
in
nc
now
an
absolutely
outstanding
pilsner
poured
a
beautiful
near
clear
color
with
hints
of
gold
an
amazing
site
to
behold
the
smell
was
faintly
sweet
being
enjoyable
the
taste
is
just
short
of
exceptionalnicely
balanced
the
mouthfeel
is
wonderfully
crisp
and
refereshing
definitely
a
beer
to
purchase
in
abundance
and
enjoy
drinkability
great
a
great
beer
for
a
bbq
out
in
the
backyard
i
will
be
sure
to
keep
extra
of
this
on
hand
now
if
it
came
in
cans
for
the
beach
that
would
be
grand
mouthfeel
nice
not
heavy
but
some
depth
to
it
drinkability
also
good
i
would
go
back
for
this
one
again
when
the
mood
for
this
style
comes
about
this
beer
poured
a
bright
pale
gold
to
yellow
very
clear
with
a
thick
white
head
composed
of
large
bubbles
the
head
receded
quickly
and
left
a
dapple
of
lace
on
the
side
of
the
glass
i
could
smell
the
hops
saaz
from
3
ft
away
they
really
dominate
the
aroma
with
a
crisp
citrus
character
no
malt
really
comes
through
in
the
nose
the
taste
is
a
light
crisp
hopforward
flavor
that
again
has
the
citrus
a
subtle
grapefruit
character
that
has
an
almost
earthy
tone
this
delivers
an
assertive
bitterness
to
the
beer
the
malt
is
completely
overcome
by
the
hops
this
is
not
a
bad
character
very
crisp
and
refreshing
mouth
feel
highly
drinkable
what
a
great
summertime
beer
pilsners
have
not
been
my
favorite
beer
for
several
years
but
this
could
change
my
mind
pours
a
very
light
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
slight
chill
haze
is
present
crisp
lemony
nose
also
includes
a
lot
of
maltiness
some
grass
is
noted
as
well
as
citrous
hops
hops
immediately
bite
your
tongue
and
dont
let
go
bitter
lemon
transitions
into
some
interesting
spiciness
bready
malt
attempts
to
balance
the
bold
hops
finish
is
spicy
with
some
herbal
qualities
backed
by
malty
smoothness
with
some
grassiness
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
clean
and
finishes
quite
dryly
light
and
refreshing
drinkability
is
quite
high
for
this
one
especially
with
the
approaching
warm
weather
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
hoppy
but
it
exceeded
my
expectations
ive
never
had
a
beer
this
light
that
was
as
aggressively
hopped
quite
interesting
and
very
tasty
maybe
this
is
what
pilsner
urquell
used
to
taste
like
pours
a
clear
straw
color
big
head
that
dies
down
good
lacing
aroma
is
similar
to
fresh
cut
grass
but
not
as
strong
taste
is
huge
hops
are
there
but
very
well
balanced
by
the
malt
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thick
for
the
style
but
i
like
em
thick
this
is
great
stuff
about
time
they
distributed
into
michigan
editted
because
i
ddi
ont
sepll
cehkc
the
taste
is
very
hoppy
but
not
powerfully
bitter
or
oily
these
are
the
noble
hops
that
are
advertised
on
the
box
they
are
very
earthy
grassy
herbal
and
chewy
but
not
bitter
and
not
palateshredding
there
is
some
balancing
sweetness
but
i
cant
say
it
balances
it
out
completely
this
is
supposed
to
be
hoppy
and
it
pulls
it
off
spectacularly
good
mouthfeel
nice
carbonation
and
a
smooth
finish
something
i
could
drink
over
and
over
drinkability
cannot
be
improved
upon
a
great
session
beer
with
exceptional
flavor
that
will
keep
me
coming
back
for
more
the
taste
was
surprisingly
bitter
the
first
couple
of
sips
acclimated
my
taste
buds
to
this
new
and
exciting
beer
i
had
especially
for
their
delight
faint
lemony
flavours
showed
up
in
the
finish
the
hops
seemed
to
outweigh
the
pilsner
malts
in
the
taste
which
was
absolutely
fine
with
me
good
bold
flavour
and
a
refreshingly
crisp
and
dry
ending
i
could
surely
sit
around
in
the
summer
time
and
pound
these
suckers
like
so
many
railroad
spikes
nice
drinkability
probably
would
be
one
of
my
got
to
pils
if
i
had
easy
access
to
it
nice
change
of
pace
with
the
heavier
hop
profile
nice
session
brew
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
best
pils
ive
had
top
notch
bright
yellow
with
slight
oh
so
slight
particles
in
the
swirl
foamy
1
inch
head
with
some

and
zest
and
it
flows
right
into
the
taste
crispy
bready
hoppy
quenching
fluid
bathes
the
mouth
wonderful
not
overly
dry
finish
this
is
a
fine
beer
that
drinks
easy
and
has
a
lot
of
character

this
would
be
great
on
a
summer
day
sitting
on
the
deck
while
chillin
and
grillin
i
had
not
had
this
in

was

impressed
with

itself
is
grainy
and
toasty
with
a
nice
dry
complexity
in
there
more
hops
than
a
typically
expect
from
the
style
but
the
bready
malt
flavors
are
very
much
to
the
forefront
as
well
as
drinkable
a
session
pils
as
youre
likely
to
find
this
one
is
a
high
point
even
for
victory
medium

with
a
smooth
carbonation
that
floats
over
the
palate
incredibly
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
damn
tasty
refreshing
brew
i
think
this
could
easily
convert
some
folks
to
better
beer
i
will
be
looking
for
a
sixer
soon
this
may
be
the
best
pils
in
existance
pours
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
the
aroma
is
lightly
malty
with
a
floral
spiciness
and
earthy

aroma
the
flavor
starts
off
clean
with
a
spicy
and
fruity
hop
flavor
followed
by
the
appropriate
bitterness
the
malt
flavor
is
light
and
clean
and
the
mouthfeel
is
medium

this

absolutely
delicious

that
i
will
be
enjoying
after
a
day
of

this

ive
been
wanting
to
try
this
beer
for
a
while
i
finally
split
a
6er
with

this
one
pours
a
nice
straw
color
with
a
small
head
over
top
of
the
beer
the
nose
is
divine
there
is
just
a
hint
of
lager
scent
in
there
but
there
is
also
a
really
big
noble
hop
presence
along
with
a
somewhat
grassey
malt
i
like
it
the
flavor
is
also
very
nice
with
a
very
crisp
and
clean
spicey
noble
hop
that
hits
first
and
fades
to
a
really
refreshing
hop
flavor
not
bitterness
the
malts
provide
just
a
slightly
sweet
background
wow
so
good
the
feel
is
thin
to
moderate
with
a
lively
carbonation

to
it
what

can
i

i
remember
liking
this
beer
more
when
i
had
it
about
a
year
ago
sadly
thats
been
the
case
with
several
victory
beers
that
ive
had
recently
taste
crazily
smooth
and
drinkable
has
a
strong
hop
profile
that
is
held
somewhat
in
check
by
chewy
malt
hops
kept
it
slightly
bitter
but
they
were
very
floral
in
nature
not
as
hoppy
as
i
remember
with
the

version
but
still
pretty

tasty

the

but
the

is
what
seperates
it
from
the
pack
they
hopped
it
up
victory
is
the
king
of
hopback
but
not
just
for
ipas
it
works
for
pils
too
i
love
the

and
this
is
a
little
over
the
top
for
the
average
joe
six
pack

but
just
right
for
me
as
i
love
hops
this
is
a
good
combination

bittering
and
finishing
aroma
hops
very
drinkable
easy
to
just
reach
for
another
ok
dont
mind
if
i
do
this
differs
from
the
bottled
version
in
that
it
is
less
brash

grassy
and
more
of
the
complete
package
as
they
say
its
hard

say

nicely
with

of

less
stregnth
than
the

the

the
carbonation
is

and
the
lack

weight
of
a

leaves
a
good

only
detraction
from

that

sweet
finish
on
any
level
true
medium
body
to
this
brew
with
a
nice
malt
backbone
that
shows
itself
in
the
end
of
the
taste
crisp
and
dry
and
very
drinkable
wow
this
is
admittedly
one
of
my
least
favorite
styles
that
being
said
smooth
as
silk
brew
is
among
the
best
highly
hopped
when
victory
brews
another
pilsner
it
is
automatically
going
to
be
judged
against
the
excellent
prima
pils
i
think
it
may
be
even
better
than
prima
lighter
on
the
hops
and
a
little
more
body
highly
enjoyable
if
victory
bottled
this
i
would
buy
it
in
a
heartbeat
the
nose
is
very
clean
simple
lots
of
dry
earthy
hops
a
little
grass
cracker
with
good
herbal

i
dont
get
any

on

a
touch
bitter
for
my
unhoppy
tastes
not
too
much
so
but
doesnt
encourage
long
term
session
enjoyed
at
pub
as
well
as
growler
right
now
very
beautiful
golden
color
virtually
no
haze
with
medium
to
full
head
that
is
white
in
color
at
least
some
residual
head
remains
over
time
aromas
of
bread
grain
and
light
grass
are
noted
on
the
palate
this
one
comes
across
somewhat
dry
with
a
mineral
component
that
reminds
me
a
little
of
dortmunder
beers
nice
dry
bready
flavors
are
noted
as
well
good
body
to
enjoy
as
a
filling
beer
on
its
own
but
yet
light
enough
for
exceptional
drinkability
and
pairing
with
foods
wish
this
one
was
bottled
o
victory
really
has
this
style
down
between
this
brew
and
prima
pils
they
dominate
the
category
especially
with
the
poor
shape
most
imports
are
in
pours
a
hazy
yellow
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
grain
floral
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grassy
and
floral
hop
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
with
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
all
around
standard
lightstraw
gold
body
with
lace
and
a
bready
pils
aroma
and
the
hops
come
out
to
play
which
i
have
noticed
alot
of
these
new
victory
brews
are
getting
hopped
up
crisp
light
bodied
easy
to
drink
there
was
just
a
sweetness
that
is
particularly
noticeable
and
slightly
askew
from
other
pilsners
not
a
complaint
just
stating
my
opinion
on
the
matter
enjoyable
sessionable
and
i
would
recommend
this
beer
to
any
pils
fan
or
simply
a
fan
of
a
good
lager
overall
very
nice
subtle
pils
straight
from
the
source
not
overly
hoppy
nor
too
sweet
this
beer
strikes
a
near
perfect
balance
more
spice
and
noble
character
throughout
and
generally
a
tasty
pils
dry
with
a
good
presence
of
grassy
noble
hop
character
lightly
bready
with
some
crackery
malt
depth
as
well
light
feel
with
crisp
carbonation
this
is
a
nice
sessionable
pilsner
maybe
not
in
my
personal
top
three
but
its
very
well
made
and
would
be
a
great
beer
to
have
around
on
tap
all
year
round
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
solid
head
that
lingers
well
lots
of
lacing
on
the
glass
smells
of
pilsner
hops
this
version
more
floral
taste
is
consistent
with
the
smell
floral
but
with
a
bit
of
piney
background
compared
to
the
prima
option
at
victory
this
has
a
little
less
pop
but
still
good
bright
slightly
hazed
yellow
under
a
thick
purewhite
head
that
settles
to
a
permanent
cap
and
leaves
some
attractive
chunks
of
foam
behind
on
the
glass
aromas
of
fresh
flowers
peppery
hops
dough
and
fresh
cracker
malt
flowery
fresh
leafy
hop
flavor
biscuity
pils
malt
finish
a
bit
of
honey
and
a
lingering
bitterness
snappy
and
super
refreshing
i
had
to
try
pretty
hard
to
slow
down
and
not
just
chug
the
whole
thing
down
at
once
excellent
a
true
winner
for
victory
here
maybe
one
of
the
best
pils
ive
had
it
tastes
like
a
very
authentic
pilsner
the
hallertau
present
more
in
bitterness
than
taste
to
my
chagrin
still
very
flavorful
for
the
style
and
easily
crushed
light
bodied
and
so
forth
this
is
an
easy
choice
if
you
see
it
on
tap
this
is
a
pretty
hoppy
pilsner
i
was
quite
impressed
it
has
balance
and
drinkability
as
well
as
a
complexity
that
i
find
lacking
in
many
pilsners
overall
this
was
a
deliciously
hoppy
smooth
easy
to
drink
pilsner
that
i
will
definitely
have
again
the
next
time
i
find
it
o
i
personally
thought
this
was
excellent
victory
really
rises
to
the
occasion
sometimes
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
crisp
and
smooth
on
the
tongue
victory
does
some
really
solid
lagers
this
is
another
memorable
example
id
revisit
d
not
bad
but
i
think
i
still
prefer
prima
pils
to
this
one
overall
a
very
hoppy
pilsner
for
sure
this
one
is
certainly
different
and
stands
out
from
others
this
one
definitely
grows
on
you
as
you
drink
it
overly
hoppy
which
in
my
opinion
takes
it
out
of
the
pils
category
but
since
im
a
hop
head
i
really
like
this
beer
the
body
is
appropriate
for
the
style
low
malt
flavor
the
aftertaste
dies
out
fairly
quickly
considering
the
punch
of
the
bitterness
in
the
mouth
medium
light
body
medium
carbonation
crisp
refreshing
and
delicious
an
truly
outstanding
pils
o
very
enjoyable
quite
easy
to
drink
and
sessionable
this
is
a
great
flavored
pils
that
i
could
drink
all
day
long
goes
well
with
lots
of
different
food
styles
and
is
quite
enjoyable
as
a
summer

well

pils
found
in
a
pub
in
the
burgh
thank
god
for
pa
breweries
who
know
how
to
brew
pils
like
troegs
stoudts
and
victory
this
is
an
exceptionally
crisp
offering
that
is
light
and
very
enjoyable
i
could
drink
a
bunch
of
this
all
day
long
very
solid
grain
to
hop
contrast
this
brew
time
and
time
again
proves
to
be
my
favorite
offering
from
victory
the
fact
that
they
switch
it
up
with
different
hops
from
time
to
time
is
an
added
bonus
braumeister

there
is

the
style

perfect
of
the

a
lightly
sweet

the

accompany
the
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
light

with
a
playful
feel
of

and
a

very
good
stuff
this
beer
pours
with
a
nice
white
head
which
dissipates
to
a
film
of
foam
fairly
quickly
it
is
just
a
bit
darker
than
yellow
and
a
bit
hazy
as
well
aroma
is
a
bit
fruity
almost
citrus
and
grapefruit
flavor
is
similar
with
a
nice
clean
bitterness
and
a
mild
yeastiness
not
much
of
a
malt
profile
at
all
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
level

carbonation
very
nice

another
great
lager
from

tasty
and
crazy
drinkable
dry

wouldnt
get
it
again

im
glad
i
tried
it
once

o
great
pilsner
victory
does
not
miss
clean
and
smooth
great
american
style
german
pils
light
and
well
carbonated
and
maybe
just
a
touch
too
much
so
braumeister
pils
is
another
standout
pilsner
from
victory
brewing
company
this
just
further
solidifies
them
as
the
best
pils
brewer
in
the
country
and
ranks
them
high
worldwide
i
would
say
overall
another
knockout
by
victory
i
wish
they
would
bottle
this
now
damned
good
and
i
mean
damned
good
pilsner
absolutely
loaded
with
flavor
great
aroma
too
really
stoked
to
get
a
chance
to
try
this
overall
different
distinct
if
a
little
odd
but
i
do
very
much
enjoy
it
had
at
tasting
last
night
so
this
will
be
from
my
notes
i
did
on
paper
that
had
someones
number
on
it
tastes
are
lemony
hops
some
grass
chives
german
hops
clean
and
crisp
maltiness
lager
yeast
age
linen
smells
like
a
typical
american
pilsner
with
some
age
to
it
and
some
biscuitiness
here
and
there
overall
a
great
pilsner
i
think
id
usually
prefer
this
to
prima
pils
because
there
is
more
balance
between
the
malt
and
the
hops
unless
i
was
in
the
mood
for
something
hoppy
basicsimpleand
solid
had
it
again
about
two
months
later
and
it
seems
to
have
more
of
a
balance
the
hops
were
backed
with
a
delicate
meatiness
the
grain
hint
of
toasty
vienna
malt
but
with
no
sweet
overtaste
dry
as
a
whistle
i
would
really
love
to
have
this
one
in
a
bottle
so
the
flavors
integrate
a
bit
in
storage
not
long
storage
because
i
cant
distinguish
if
this
is
the
same
batch
or
a
new
one
overall
pretty
good
decent
hops
and
not
too
bitter
nice
malts
toasty
nice
lager
flavors
dry
clean
and
crisp
finish
nice
summer
drink
o
another
great
pils
made
by
victory
these
braumeister
pils
are
just
awesome
just
such
a
drinkable
beer
that
wont
kick
your
ass
alcohol
wise
as
i
said
this
one
is
much
sweeter
and
more
balanced
than
the
prima
and
much
softer
still
a
fantastic
beer
that
i
am
lucky
enough
to
have
a
keg
of
to
enjoy
through
this
spring
o
it
is
fantasticly
flavorful
light
and
quaffable
d
i
enjoy
prima
pils
this
is
another
great
offering
i
am
loving
this
one
great
beer
i
could
drink
it
all
day
ontap
at
flying
saucer
served
in
a
standard
pint
glass
a
slightly
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
nice
off
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
ring
and
leaves
just
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
mild
pale
malts
alongside
crisp
earthy
hops
the
taste
is
a
smooth
balance
of
sweet
biscuity
malts
and
smooth
earthy
hops
the
beer
is
quite
light
smooth
and
very
crisp
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
one
i
would
certainly
have
again
braumeister
pils
is
a
really
great
germanstyle
pilsener
from
victory
it
has
the
perfect
woody
and
spicy
noble
hop
aroma
and
flavor
that
evokes
in
me
the
sensory
memory
of
walking
in
a
beech
forest
in
late
fall
after
an
early
morning
shower
it
has
a
very
green
grounded
hop
character
that
is
invigorating
i
would
love
to
try
this
and
prima
pils
backtoback
to
compare
i
havent
had
that
beer
in
months
braumeister
is
very
clean
dry
and
has
a
nice
malty
taste
pours
straw
yellow
with
a
slight
haze
a
twofinger
white
head
that
dissipates
quickly
but
leaves
lots
of
lacing
the
smell
is
cut
grass
and
clover
maybe
some
bitter
marigold
crisp
well
water
sourdough
bread
the
taste
is
sourdough
starter
wood
sorrel
bright
minerals
from
what
has
to
be
a
great
water
source
and
an
earthy
bitter
finish
its
a
little
more
viscous
than
youd
expect
but
the
high
carbonation
balances
that
out
pretty
well
its
great
hotweather
beer
but
would
also
go
well
on
a
brisk
fall
day
i
shouldve
gotten
64
oz
rather
than
32
one
of
my
favorite
american
pilsners

a
very
enjoyable
sessionable
beer
at

wish
i
got
a
growler
of
this
to
go
d
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
may
be
even
better
than
prima
hops
are
well
at
the
forefront
which
i
like
d
like
prima
pils
this
beer
is
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
but
the
use
of
a
single
variety
of
hops
makes
it
taste
a
bit
different
dr
okay
not
wonderful
a
whole
growler
to
go
so
i
cant
complain
too
much
d
tasty
plenty
easy
to
drink
seems
very
wellproportioned
ontap
at
liberty
st
tavern
appeared
a
hazy
gold
with
with
a
couple
fingers
of
white
head
basically
this
is
a
very
american
pilsner
its
big
on
hops
but
there
isnt
much
subtle
malt
or
yeast
character
still
the
grassy
herbal
hops
are
delicious
plus
the
bitterness
isnt
too
harsh
id
be
happy
to
drink
several
had
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
the
drink
had
a
gold
slightamber
color
that
was
generally
murky
grassy
hops
help
make
a
full
aroma
sense
the
flavors
were
generally
bittersweet
with
that
grassy
bready
tones
pretty
light
with
little
carbonation
but
not
too
watery
overall
not
too
bad
this
pilsner
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
centimeter
or
so
or
nice
white
foam
the
smell
was
a
beautiful
aromatic
hop
aroma
similar
to
prima
pils
the
taste
was
a
a
crisp
hoppy
pilsner
not
so
bready
with
malt
but
a
great
flavor
nonetheless
again
very
similar
to
prima
pils
the
mouthfeel
was
dry
and
crisp
with
medium
body
and
good
sturdy
carbonation
the
malt
and
aromatic
hops
lingered
in
the
mouthfeel
this
was
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
enjoyed
more
than
one
d
a
great
pils
in
every
way
very
fresh
like
few
i
have
tasted
top
notch
german
style
lager
from
victory
does
not
fail
to
deliver
at
all
the
lasting
hop
in
the
finish
is
great
pretty
drinkable
i
suppose
but
not
something
i
would
have
again
a
solid
beer
but
not
as
good
as
i
was
expecting
have
to
say
the
i
prefer
the
harvest
version
of
this
beer
which
hopefully
ill
get
to
try
again
this
fall
note
it
seems
like
victory
put
out
several
versions
of
beer
referred
to
as
braumeister
pils
and
i
am
making
my
best
assumption
as
to
which
i
just

54kudos
to
the
folks
at
victory
for
this
singlehop
series
this
particular
version
seemed
true
to
the
pilsner
style
german
raised
and
this
was
the
best
discontinued
their
replacement
pilsner
is
very
good
o
this
is
a
nice
easy
pilsner
and
a
great
everyday
beer
a
good
beer
to
convert
a
macrobrew
drinker
o
a
better
than
average
pilsner
definitely
get
a
sense
of
quality
all
the
way
a
refreshing
warm
weather
andor
thirstquenching
brew
not
much
more
you
could
ask
for
in
a
pilsner
appearance
is
the
typical
clear
straw
golden
and
highly
carbonated
smell
mainly
consists
of
pilsner
malt
with
some
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
very
clean
consisting
of
a
sweet
nutty
malt
followed
by
light
citrus
hop
that
blends
together
for
a
nice
finish
a
thanks
to
the
legendary
woodychandler
for
this
beer
poured
from
a
12
oz
can
beer
came
gushing
out
of
this
can
upon
the
crack
resulting
in
a
yellowwhiteish
color
with
several
inches
of
head
smell
is
of
grains
lemons
taste
is
malts
grains
lemony
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
overall
makes
for
a
good
session
beer
overall
aggressively
hopped
for
the
style
which
i
dont
mind
still
quite
drinkable
i
can
see
how
the
bitter
back
end
could
turn
off
some
people
though
definitely
worked
as
tonights
cooking
beer
a
decent
take
on
the
style
but
still
not
one
id
revisit
drinkable
overall
and
crisp
and
refreshing
but
i
just
cant
get
over
the
type
of
hop
profile
here
dirty
bitter
and
unflavorful
its
still
a
solid
representation
of
the
style
but
maybe
this
one
just
has
a
bit
too
much
flavor
for
me
not
bad
for
the
style
o
this
is
a
great
pilsner
fantastic
hop
presence
and
great
flavor
poured
from
tap
a
coalhouse
in
stamford
ct
pours
a
golden
straw
with
a
bit
of
white
lacing
nice
crisp
bready
malt
and
some
nice

aromas
not
typical
lager
skunk
great
flavors
of
bready
malt
with
a
nice
dose
of
fruityness
and
a
great

this
isnt
your

when

a

and
always
fresh
germanstyled
pils
cheers
my
first
beer
from
nebco
it
wont
be
my
last
i
noticed
floral
aromas
and
smells
quite
a
bit
nice
hoppiness
with
a
dry
finish
all
in
all
a
nice
pilsner
that
would
be
a
good
session
beer
had
this
a
ton
of
times
and
finally
now
decided
to
review
it
12oz
can
in
the
new
yellow
and
green
cans
so
its
safe
to
assume
it
is
pretty
fresh
pours
a
translucent
light
golden
yellow
color
with
an
inch
of
frothy
white
head
some
lacing
aromas
of
cut
grass
floral
hops
some
grains
and
sourdough
bread
taste
is
grassy
with
some
floral
hops
upfront
followed
by
a
slightly
sour
finish
a
bit
bready
crisp
and
really
drinkable
bit
of
a
floral
bitter
aftertaste
this
is
my
goto
beach
beer
overall
solid
offering
for
a
style
that
can
be
somewhat
boring
if
that
seems
too
abstract
or
selfindulgent
ill
just
say
that
the
flavor
is
muddled
but
good
it
delivers
the
german
hops
and
prettywelldone
malt
but
i
can
think
of
other
beers
that
do
both
better
o
pretty
decent
pilsner
with
a
low
hop
profile
but
a
lot
of
lasting
bitterness
was
hoping
for
a
bit
more
grain
and
toast
but
oh
well
a
decent
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
overalla
great
quality
pilsener
glad
to
see
more
good
lager
styles
cropping
up
in
the
us
good
version
of
the
brew
but
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
bold
flavors
very
enjoyable
sweetish
doughy
malt
up
front
a
little
toasted
grain
perhaps
spicy
peppery
hop
bitterness
comes
on
soon
enough
and
makes
for
a
snappy
refreshing
beer
a
little
honey
midpalate
dry
finish
with
lingering
peppery
hop
bitterness
moderate
body
with
a
nice
lively
feel
very
quaffable
especially
on
a
hot
humid
summer
day
o
a
solid
pilsner
overall
not
much
complexity
to
it
but
its
enjoyable
and
drinkable
notes
very
solid
very
drinkable
cheers
o
i
would
take
prima
pils
ahead
of
this
but
still
a
nice
pilsener
with
a
good
flavor
profile
and
the
cans
just
scream
take
me
camping
i
would
get
this
again
overall
impression
im
not
sure
if
i
just
havent
had
a
pilsner
in
a
while
or
what
but
this
one
was
beyond
refreshing
good
amount
of
noble
hop
character
and
went
down
better
than
most
brews
of
this
style
would
recommend
trying
if
you
can
get
brews
from
new
england
but
not
a
must
if
i
could
i
would
keep
12
of
these
in
my
fridge
at
all
times
for
after
a
tennis
match
or
workout
great

o

has
a
nice
clean

not

overall
but
seems
to
lack
a

i
would
drink
one
again
as
it
is

nothing
great
about
this

but
its
simplicity
and
ability
to
stay
true

should
be
commended
light

a
touch

my
first

brewing
offering
leaves
me
excited
to
the
try
the
other
i
picked
up
on
a
recent
trip
through
the
area
a
top
notch
lager
overall
nothing
stood
out
as
superb
about
this
beer
but
its
certainly
easy
to
drink
and
is
worth
a
shot
d
its
not
a
bad
beer
just
in
the
middle
of
the
pack
elm
city
lager
could
use
more
bready
maltiness
with
a
sharper
hoppiness
that
leaves
the
soap
at
home
and
ramps
up
the
carbonation
for
much
more
crispness
aroma
of
grain
with
a
slight
noble
hop
character
crisp
and
clean
with
great
carbonation
and
a
light
body
drinkability
is
fantastic
given
the
low
alcohol
and
high
flavor
perfect
for
those
hot
summer
days
a
wonderful
american
version
of
a
traditional
german
lager
o
been
loving
this
beer
recently
as
i
have
been
on
a
pilsner
kick
odthis
style
is
far
from
my
favorite
but
this
specific
beer
is
pretty
damn
tasty
the
malt
is
the
key
here
it
balances
out
those
spinachtasting
hops
quite
well
a
bit
sweet
bready
hoppy
and
even
once
again
nebco
delivers
mildly
shocked
to
realize
that
sea
hag
ipa
perhaps
my
favorite
style
of
beer
is
so
far
my
least
favorite
branch
from
the
nebco
tree
got
a
six
pack
of
elm
city
for
nine
dollars
and
some
change
regretted
the
purchase
after
i
walked
out
of
the
store
not
regretting
during
the
session
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
and
i
have
to
say
that
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
an
american
brewed
german
lager
i
have
had
this
beer
many
times
over
the
yearsi
recently
bought
a
sixtel
for

a
bright
yellow
beer
with
a
very
nice
white

and
quite
a
bit
of
lacing
on
the
way
down
the
nose
brings
forward
mild
grain
plus
a
touch
of
light
noble

the
flavor
is
slightly
bready
with
some
grain
and
hay
not
too
much
spicy
hop
flavor
but
there
is
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
feel
is
light
and
only
moderately
crisp
though
not
as
much
as
id
like
for
the
style
fairly
drinkable
and
a
nice
brew
on
a
rather
warm
spring
evening
taste
was
pretty
creamy
and
smooth
a
decent
amount
of
noble
hops
in
there
a
bit
pronounced
upfront
and
a
bit
more
fruity
than
some
other
pilsners
but
it
became
really
light
when
paired
with
some
food
d
very
drinkable
clean
and
crisp
from
start
to
end
but
still
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
enjoyable
the

is
really
nice

brew
great
on

drinkable
enough
a
good
not
a
great
pils
but
easily
the
equal
of
many
ive
had
in
germany
1
70
for
the
single
this
is
a
really
nice
pils
and
one
of
the
best
domestics
not
made
in
pa
i
would
say
i
need
to
get
a
growler
of
this
at
the
brewery
next
time
im
there
because
i
bet
the
carbonation
is
better
and
the
beer
is
therefore
even
better
as
well
quite
enjoyable
on
the
high
side
of
light
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
i
like
the
mouth
feel
and
i
reckon
the
drinkability
is
great
a
very
nice
treat
for
myself
d
its
easy
to
drink
for
sure
not
sure
how
often
id
go
after
this
one
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
sweet
standard
lager
smell
in
the
taste
a
small
sweet
lager
standardness
and
a
bit
perfume
like
a
smooth
and
light
to
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
perfume
like
aftertaste
an
ok
lager
but
quite
perfume
like
di
am
liking
this
the
more
i
drink
a
quality
solid
and
refreshing
brew
that
is
the
go
to
local
alternative
to
any
bmc
mass
produced
swill
offering
support
your
local
and
drink
well
nice
job
nebc
this
isnt
a
style
of
beer
that
i
frequent
but
i
actually
really
enjoyed
the
taste
there
was
a
prominent
biscuity
malt
and
distinct
yeast
the
highlight
of
the
taste
in
my
opinion
was
there
was
a
very
nice
kind
of
nuttiness
to
it
i
am
not
sure
what
kind
but
it
was
there
and
very
tasty
the
hops
were
faded
in
the
back
but
that
didnt
take
away
from
the
beer
at
all
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
to
light
and
a
bit
sticky
i
could
definitely
drink
more
than
a
few
of
these
a
very
good
beer
across
the
board
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
beer
its
got
a
nice
hoppiness
to
it
that
again
is
true
to
style
which
makes
it
both
crisp
and
refreshing
its
hardly
bitter
but
the
hop
bite
is
nice
there
is
a
malt
presence
here
but
it
kind
of
takes
a
backseat
to
the
hops
the
yeast
comes
through
a
bit
too
strong
for
me
thats
my
main
criticism
of
this
it
almost
has
a
bit
a
a
belgian
taste
from
the
yeast
some
fruity
esters
still
a
nice
refreshing
lager
poured
from
a
can
a
crisp
and
perfectly
carbonated
yellow
color
aromas
were
muted
but
pleasant
wet
grains
and
a
touch
of
alcohol
this
is
a
really
great
german
style
pilsener
with
decent
hop
showing
and
that
crisp
malt
bite
highly
recommend
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
something
refreshing
or
looking
for
a
session
beer
too
bad
its
not
an
option
on
long
island
drinkability
is
just
like
sn
summerfest
drink
it
cold
on
a
hot
day
and
you
wont
regret
it
tends
to
get
a
little
boring
if
these
two
factors
arent
together
though
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
the
pours
is
light
see
through
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
cloudy
body
about
two
fingers
of
a
creamy
fluffy
white
head
sit
atop
and
retain
nicely
this
looks
amazing
the
smell
is
of
grain
wheat
oats
and
other
earthy
aromas
subtle
spiciness
and
lemon
zest
finish
this
strong
the
flavor
is
grainy
and
full
of
pilsner
malts
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
at
the
finish
this
one
is
really
rocking
my
socks
nice
and
light
with
great
flavors
give
this
a
nice
mouthfeel
and
outstanding
drinkability
this
is
just
what
i
wanted
tonight
bravo
a
very
solid
session
beer
especially
in
the
summer
months
a
pretty
decent
summer
time
beer
easy
to
drink
light
toasty
taste
with
some
noble
hop
flavor
in
the
back
honestly
i
wish
the
macrobrews
would
make
their
beers
taste
more
like
this
and
less
like
corn
and
rice
adjuncts
after
i
finished
the
brew
i
did
get
a
weird
metallic
taste
but
overall
i
was
satisfied
tasted
from
12oz
can
pours
golden
with
a
onefinger
white
head
that
has
some
staying
power
nose
is
somewhat
skunky
with
some
sweet
malts
and
anise
flavors
are
light
with
some
malts
and
a
very
light
hoppiness
the
body
is
light
with
average
carbonation
and
a
pretty
short
finish
despite
the
lack
of
any
complexity
this
beer
is
actually
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
great
go
to
beer
for
the
summer
season
yet
still
serviceable
all
year
long
fairly
light
and
very
refreshing
but
flavorful
theres
a
nice
grainy
undercurrent
to
the
moderately
hoppy
flavor
this
would
be
better
poured
into
a
glass
of
course
but
is
still
quite
good
out
of
the
can
at
a
summer
picnic
solid
german
pils
the
brewer
compares
it
to
radeberger
which
is
very
apt
d
pretty
good
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
great
outdoorsy
beer
for
the
summer
i
have
quite
a
few
german
pils
i
enjoy
more
though
this
is
not
bad
by
any
means
d
i
would
drink
this
stuff
in
mass
quantities
particularly
in
the
summer
after
mowing
the
lawn
pilsner
lovers
would
like
this
a
lot
all
in
all
this
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
every
day
light
beer
might
be
an
easy
crossover
brew
from
mainstream
to
craft
not
worth
hunting
but
decent
to
drink
if
you
have
access
taste
is
grainy
with
subtle
bitterness
and
some
floral
notes
definitely
crisp
and
a
very
clean
taste
it
really
reminds
me
of
a
standard
adjunct
lager
nothing
exciting
but
not
bad
light
body
a
little
refreshing
slight
carbonation
d
very
drinkable
low
in
abv
and
good
flavor
make
this
a
great
summer
time
beer
from
a
can
another
example
of
a
tasty
beer
in
a
can
more
like
this
will
help
erase
the
idea
that
only
macro
swill
comes
in
cans
another
solid
product
from
nebc
very
drinkable
could
have
several
of
these
hoping
to
pick
up
a
growler
some
day
and
taste
the
brewery
fresh
version
drinkability
really
isnt
too
bad
while
not
particularly
spectacular
i
enjoyed
the
beer
enough
if
i
had
regular
access
to
it
i
wouldnt
put
it
in
regular
rotation
but
wouldnt
mind
sipping
a
few
here
there
f
finishes
with
some
dryness
and
a
little
bitter
spicy
hop
character
a
slight
grassy
hop
also
comes
out
on
the
finish
some
slight
wheat
and
banana
flavors
also
linger
a
bit
a
slight
lip
smacking
stickiness
too
combined
with
the
dry
finish
to
create
a
strange
mouth
feel
overall
a
nice
lager
i
would
almost
even
be
compelled
to
drink
from
the
can
on
a
hot
summers
day
this
is
a
solid
german
pilsner
that
well
pleases
i
could
drink
plenty
of
these
in
one
sitting
mouthfeel
is
light
with
above
average
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
i
could
easily
have
several
of
these
this
isnt
my

style
but
its
a
very
good
beer

its

at

went
down

too
quick
for

a

would
work
well
with
a

alternative
for
a

is

what

is
with

good
job
putting
this
one
in

as
it
really
comes
off
as
a
good
choice
for
a
summertime
guzzle
pretty
drinkable
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
overall
really
good
drinkability
very
nice
interesting
flavors
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
but
still
pretty
refreshing
no
hits
no
runs
but
most
importantly
no
errors
theres
a
good
beer
struggling
to
get
through
here
i
dont
know
whats
up
with
the
butter
smell
but
it
really
took
a
chunk
out
of
the
quality
of
this
brew
but
its
still
pretty
refreshing
despite
that
d
overall
elm
city
lager
is
a
great
pils
that
i
will
definitely
be
picking
up
more
of
when
the
temperature
starts
to
rise
this
is
a
great
outdoors
beachfishing
beer
because
it
is
light
bodied
tasty
and
convenient
in
a
can
recommended
d
a
good
german
inspired
pilsner
in
a
can
no
less
light
on
the
alcohol
and
a
sharp
flavor
profile
makes
this
a
go
to
this
does
not
look
like
much
coming
from
the
can
watery
but
holds
up
in
taste
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
bright
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
smells
a
bit
of
baking
products
not
much
else
it
tastes
like
some
freshly
baked
white
bread
just
a
tad
sweet
the
mouthfeel
is
cool
and
crisp
the
drinkability
is
solid
it
is
one
that
would
go
well
throughout
a
night
of
playing
some
poker
i
could
drink
this
all
day
5
light
crisp
flavors
and
finish
just
my
kind
of
summer
beer
very
drinkable
and
a
nice
session
brew
for
what
it
is
its
nice
but
its
not
a
classic
thats
for
sure
new
england
brewing
has
pretty
decent
german
pilsener
here
its
a
little
low
on
flavor
and
character
but
its
far
from
bad
its
a
little
to
earthy
and
grassy
some
of
the
other
flavors
could
stand
a
little
more
of
the
spotlight
theres
far
superior
german
pilseners
out
there
but
this
isnt
a
bad
option
by
any
means
thanks

d
very
drinkable

it
this
time
around
alot
more
than
i
remembered

this
is
quite
sessionable

to
serve
extra

in

the
taste
was
a
bit
more
complex
and
enjoyable
than
the
smell
would
indicate
with
some
nice
spiciness

in
with
floral

the

extremely
high
on

and
i
could
see
myself
polishing
off
a
six

of
these
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
a
pretty
good
beer

very
well

its

unspectacular
unfortunately
im

a

bubbly
around

of

aroma
is
both
malty
and
hoppy
with
the
malt
winning
the
battle
moderate
carbonation
taste
is
more
malt
sweetness
than
hops
but
they
are
both
there
and
living
in
harmony
ever
so
slight
alcohol
burn
beer
seems
to
have
lost
a
little
of
its
boldness
though
i
am
drinking
it
just
8
days
before
the
best
by
date
overall
decent
pilsener
nothing
incredible
not
sure
about
the
pilsner
designation
has
an
odd
flavor
to
it

didnt
do
anything
to
grab
me
overall
i
think
abitas
ales
are
better
than
their
lagers
but
thats
just
my
opinion
od
this
was
a
good
pils
it
was
clear
that
they
used
wheat
in
it
and
it
did
well
with
the
hop
flavour
good
balance
and
drinkable
beer
is
mediumbodied
with
carbonation
of
medium
resulting
in
a
foamy
910
and
slightly
smooth
110
mouthfeel
that
comes
across
as
rather
soft
and
pillowy
this
is
appropriate
for
the
beer
making
it
pleasurable
and
easy
to
drink
and
within
boundaries
for
the
helles
bock
style
in
general
overall
this
is
very
good
tasting
beer
its
clean
taste
is
a
testament
to
the
local

to
brew

it
was
like

but
with
lemon
instead
of

it
was
served
with

beer
id
have
it
again
particularly
since
75c
goes
to
sos
overall
good
brew
for
a
good
cause
i
would
have
this
one
again
brewed
in
louisiana
bottle
from
bevmo
for
3
49
and
75
cents
goes
to
charity
to
save
our
shore
first
time
trying
it
nice
big
white
head
looking
hazy
n
pale
yellow
flowery
very
hoppy
for
a
pilzner
crisp
clean
n
refreshing
im
impressed
id
buy
it
again
o
a
nice
beer
to
sit
back
and
relax
with
drink
it
cold
or
dont
even
bother
the
difference
is
startling
o
good
brew
worth
trying
would
buy
again
drinkability
a
great
session
beer
reminds
me
of
a
blue
moonheineken
hybrid
overall
for
an
imperial
pilsner
its
not
bad
granted
its
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
was
worth
the
3
dollar
price
tag
plus
75
cents
goes
to
help
nature
and
shit
hells
yeah
oa
solid
easy
drinking
big
sassy
pils
plenty
of
malt
a
bit
lingering
havy
in
the
finish
but
definitely
a
solid
brew
nice
golden
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
near
pure
white
head
that
retreats
to
a
layer
of
small
bubbles
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
bread
with
a
bit
of
spicy
hop
character
in
the
background
a
touch
of
fruity
ester
comes
through
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
smell
with
a
base
of
clean
and
slightly
sweet
pale
malt
the
hops
are
restrained
but
definitely
present
with
great
noble
hop
spice
and
grassy
flavors
the
carbonation
is
somewhat
low
to
moderate
and
the
finish
of
this
beer
is
almost
very
clean
leaving
just
a
bit
of
sticky
hop
flavor
and
malt
overall
this
isnt
a
world
class
german
pilsner
but
it
is
a
pretty
good
american
made
example
of
the
style
and
the
cause
benefited
by
sales
of
this
beer
make
it
well
worth
it
o
i
dont
plan
to
buy
this
one
again
im
glad
that

made
it
to
a
good
cause
but
unless
a
sourvanilla
pilsner
sounds
right
up
your
alley
or
youre
a
big
fan
of
abita
already
id
say
skip
this
for
purple
haze
or
their
standard
amber
o
i
wouldnt
classify
this
beer
as
a
true
pilsenerit
is
more
like
a
hefeweizen
but
either
way
it
hides
its
alcohol
very
well
pours
hazy
golden
with
an
abundant
white
head
the
head
dissipates
leaving
lacing
on
the
side
of
the
glass
there
are
a
lot
of
tiny
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
hops
its
such
a
bright
earthy
smell
the
taste
is
sweet
from
the
malts
and
is
balanced
by
the
hop
bitterness
theres
some
citrus
flavor
from
the
hops
which
helps
cut
with
the
bitterness
and
sweetness
to
produce
an
excellently
balanced
beer
the
alcohol
does
not
come
through
in
the
taste
but
you
will
notice
the
effect
as
you
continue
to
drink
the
beer
the
flavors
only
get
better
as
the
beer
warms
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
creamy
yet
crisp
mouthfeel
the
crispness
comes
from
the
abundant
carbonation
this
is
very
easy
to
gulp
overall
this
is
an
excellent
and
interesting
beer
although
not
remarkable
sos
is
a
fairly
smooth
and
drinkable
pils
refreshing
too
this
is
a
nice
companion
to
my
soup
and
salad
lunch
o
a
good
but
average
pilsner
ive
had
some
that
i
greatly
prefer
but
i
wouldnt
turn
this
down
if
offered
it
again
overall
there
is
some
noticeable
alcohol
heat
but
nothing
that
warrants
a
gag
or
disappointing
drinking
experience
this
feels
very
easy
drinking
and
offers
a
good
pilsner
enjoyment
i
am
usually
not
that
impressed
by
this
brewery
but
i
could
easily
have
this
again
and
probably
will
smell
reminds
me
of
fresh
sliced
apples
a
nice
crisp
tasting
beer
makes
me
wish
i
would
of
picked
up
a
second
bottle
o
average
beer
but
that
doesnt
make
it
hard
to
drink
or
unenjoyable
nothing
id
buy
but
you
could
do
worse
pours
a
one

cheers
o
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
one
but
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
that
tastes
good
worth
getting
sometime
if
you
see
it
around
food
pairing
fish
or
shrimp
maybe
a
shrimp
poboy
to
be
more
exact
looks
similar
in
color
to
andygator
golden
honey
but
this
one
has
a
two
finger
fluffy
foamy
head
that
stuck
around
for
more
than
a
minute
and
left
behind
some
pretty
nice
lacing
body
is
light
and
carbonation
is
at
exactly
the
right
sort
of
effervescent
level
for
a
pilsener
smells
mostly
lemony
but
also
medium
pale
malt
scent
is
there
flavor
is
not
nearly
as
heavy
on
the
hop
spicing
as
i
had
anticipated
i
originally
thought
it
would
be
a
czechstyle
until
i
did
my
homework
but
it
works
as
a
german
pilsener
that
depends
almost
entirely
on
floral
and
earth
toned
hopping
im
not
picking
up
on
any
of
the
subtle
fruit
tones
mentioned
by
other
bas
however
so
im
left
with
a
really
pretty
beer
that
has
a
really
great
mouthfeel
and
very
simplistic
and
clean
flavors
and
aromas
decent
for
a
charity
beer
served
from
bottle
into
a
spaten
optimator
dimpled
mug
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
two
finger
pure
white
head
that
subsided
to
half
a
finger
slowly
maintained
phenomenal
lacing
throughout
the
glass
the
aroma
was
comprised
of
sweet
malt
wheat
spices
and
a
subtle
floral
note
the
flavor
was
of
sweet
malt
floral
wheat
subtle
spices
and
subtle
fruit
it
had
a
very
light
feel
on
the
palate
with
medium
carbonation
overall
this
was
a
decent
brew
nothing
really
stood
out
on
this
brew
with
the
exception
of
the
floral
note
i
picked
up
on
the
rest
of
the
brew
was
kind
of
weak
in
flavor
in
my
opinion
as
nothing
really
jumped
out
at
me
not
bad
for
the
style
but
not
great
either
worth
trying
though
even
if
it
is
for
the
good
cause
they
are
brewing
it
for
found
at
cardinal
liqs
niles
il
im
not
a
huge
pilsener
guy
but
this
was
crisp
balanced
and
highly
drinkable
more
than
happy
to
contribute
to
those
poor
people
and
wildlife
screwed
by
big
oil
good
job
abita
o
enjoyable
for
the
style
im
still
not
a
huge
pilsener
fan
but
this
is
one
i
could
drink
again
well
done
pretty
refreshing
overall
and
the
wheat
makes
for
a
varied
interesting
approach
to
the
style
drinking
this
calls
up
images
of
the
beach
and
ocean
waves
or
maybe
im
just
influenced
by
the
verycool
artwork
on
this
label
pours
a
slightly
hazy
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
foamy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
cap
nice
foamy
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
wheatgrains
grassy
notes
and
some
citrus
aromas
taste
is
of
bread
grains
and
some
herbalcitrus
zest
hops
mild
hop
bitterness
sticks
to
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsener
that
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
its
nice
to
see
a
brewery
involved
in
the
community
with
this
type
of
cause
a
nice
beer
overall
overall
drinkability
this
is
not
a
pilsner
to
my
taste
buds
it
is
an
esb
andor
american
wheat
at
heart
o
exceptional
and
not
just
because
its
charitable
very
good
brew
by
abita
pours
a
hazy
yellow
in
an
oversized
pilsner
glass
produces
a
medium
sticky
head
smells
of
yeast
lemon
and
a
bit
of
hop
taste
is
dry
grain
lemongrass
yeast
bright
and
refreshing
great
balance
of
yeasty
grainy
malt
and
a
little
hop
on
the
rear
of
the
tongue
aftertaste
leaves
you
wanting
more
high
medium
carbonation
goes
down
smooth
and
very
quenching
spot
on
for
the
style
this
is
perfect
hot
weather
beer
a
good
stepping
off
point
for
beginners
i
would
venture
a
fine
example
of
a
style
i
love
this
time
of
year
overall
a
delicious
introduction
to
abita
plus
there
cant
be
a
better
reason
to
buy
beer
than
to
donate
to
a
cause
cheers
an
excellent
american
twist
on
a
summer
helles
this
has
hints
of
sweetness
and
brisk
as
hell
hopping
the
abv
isnt
noticeable
at
all
and
the
grain
isnt
heavy
handed
as
in
mineral

2
fingers

unfermentable
sugars
blended

zesty
but
doesnt
drop
off
as
fast
as
a
pilsner
would
mild
sweetness
very
mild
earthiness
lemon
pulp
hints
but
still
has
a
significant
mineral
character
that
makes
it
very
dry
but
more
so
tannin
sticky
this
doesnt
have
a
husky
lingering
quality
either
great
feel
a
good
beer
for
a
good
cause
o
solid
effort
but
an
overall
forgettable
beer
still
its
for
a
good
cause
so
ill
happily
enjoy
this
one
overall
an
ok
pilsner
but
nothing
i
would
reach
for
again
i
would
sooner
get
their
golden
ale
a
little
less
alcohol
heat
would
make
me
want
this
more
though
pours
a
very
clear
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
not
much
retention
but
some
good
spotty
lacing
and
a
nice
collar
on
the
way
down
the
nose
carries
quite
a
bit
of
bready
malt
with
an
eversoslight
presence
of
floral
hops
the
flavor
is
mostly
bread
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
grain
nothing
too
complex
and
no
real
hops
the
body
is
not
terribly
impressive
fairly
thick
and
chewy
with
lower
levels
of
carbonation
some
alcohol
and
no
real
hop
presence
not
a
big
fan
of
this
also
75cents
of
every
bottle
sold
goes
to
helping
clean
up
the
gulf
coast
so
come
on
people
buy
one
and
enjoy
it
by
drinking
beer
you
are
helping
the
planet
i
dont
need
a
better
reason
to
drink
then
that
o
this
has
decent
drinkability
it
goes
down
fairly
easy
and
it
refreshing
overall
i
thought
it
was
a
decent
pilsner
it
was
a
little
bit
underwhelming
and
i
didnt
like
the
bitter
finish
it
was
worth
a
try
though
i
really
like
this
one
from
abita
their
brand
had
fallen
out
of
style
for
me
but
this
one
might
bring
me
back
in
hides
the
abv
shockingly
well
overall
decent
pilsner
and
very
drinkable
if
you
are
a
fan
of
pilsners
which
im
not
i
would
give
it
a
try
o
a
very
pleasing
easy
drinker
im
not
overly
partial
towards
pilseners
but
i
would
certainly
buy
this
again
pours
a
straw
colored
yellow
into
a
pilsner
glass
abitas
sos
shows
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
head
that
just
wont
quit
the
smell
is
mild
hops
and
even
milder
citrus
sos
taste
is
bready
and
only
very
mildly
hoppy
its
a
mellow
pilsner
thats
incredibly
easy
to
drink
maybe
its
because
im
on
vacation
as
i
write
this
review
but
if
this
beer
is
sending
out
a
message
on
conservation
im
all
in
except
as
it
relates
to
sos
i
want
more
i
thought
this
was
great
it
definitely
put
pilseners
back
on
my
beer
radar
the
balance
was
superb
and
it
remained
easygoing
yet
flavorful
o
not
bad
for
a
pilsner
and
for
5
for
a
22oz
its
a
good
one
to
get
someone
else
into
craft
brews
overall
very
good
beer
and
for
a
good
cause
to
boot
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
faint
saaz
hop
in
the
taste
a
sweet
malt
and
a
small
saaz
hop
very
clean
though
a
small
hop
bite
and
a
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
semi
dry
saaz
pilsner
hop
in
the
aftertaste
a
standard
pils
yet
a
bit
sweeter
pale
lager
yes
imperial
pilsner
no

a
little
funky
and
malty
aroma
yellowish
body
rather
a
story
of
sugary
malt
predominates
with
drying
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
a
drop
of
lemon
above
average
carbonation
passable
beer
o
it
was
fine
on
the
boring
and
forgettable
side
the
bottle
artwork
is
pretty
cool
though
but
that
doesnt
get
this
beer
any
bonus
points
i
like
that
this
bottle
calls
it
a
charitable
pilsner
i
decided
to
pick
this
one
up
in
florida
because
the
bottles
are
much
fresher
than
in
indiana
it
poured
a
not
quite
transparent
gold
with
a
half
finger
white
head
it
smelled
of
light
hops
with
pale
honey
like
malts
with
a
dash
of
lemon
zest
it
tastes
pretty
bitter
for
a
pilsner
it
tastes
of
the
pale
malt
honey
and
lemon
grass
the
honey
kind
of
fades
into
the
background
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
most
and
was
pretty
good
overall
a
great
drink
the
alcohol
is
not
evident
on
the
tongue
or
throat
but
has
crept
up
as
i
finished
the
bottle
a
beer
that
donates
proceeds
is
another
plus
in
my
book
even
though
i
split
this
with
a
friend
i
could
have
finished
this
myself
since
the
alcohol
couldnt
be
felt
at
all
this
isnt
as
crisp
as
a
textbook
pils
but
its
still
easygoing
with
just
a
bit
more
body
to
it
than
i
anticipated
its
good
to
see
that
this
was
brewed
with
a
cause
in
mind
and
thankfully
the
beer
measures
up
to
that
aspiration
drinkability
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
sip
im
sure
it
would
be
very
nice
as
the
weather
gets
warmer
d
good
drinkability
but
the
high
abv
definitely
knocks
it
down
a
peg
or
two
as
it
is
felt
and
tasted
i
do
like
this
although
im
not
sure
the
circumstances
to
buy
it
easily
drinkable
although
relatively
lower
end
of
flavor
spectrum
not
really
much
of
a
wheat
beer
taste
with
that
said
it
does
go
down
easy
and
is
a
good
flavor
more
of
a
pilsner
taste
to
me
75
of
your
dough
will
benefit
the
gulf
coast
relief
efforts
according
to
abitas
pretty
cool
label
work
that
may
be
enough
reason
to
pick
one
up
for
what
it
is
its
drinkable
being
7
the
alcohol
could
sneak
up
on
you
real
easy
def
a
good
alternative
to
a
true
pils
or
wheat
beer
save
our
shores
pilsner
is
clean
refreshing
very
drinkable
tasty
and
a
quality
brew
the
more
wheat
beer
flavor
it
has
adds
complexity
and
makes
it
more
enjoyable
i
definitely
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
wants
a
reasonably
priced
and
great
quality
pilsner
especially
in
this
hot
summer
it
was
106
f
in
denton
last
week
and
youre
helping
the
gulf
with
the
oil
spill
when
you
buy
it
its
a
winwin
scenario
d
gotta
love
a
beer
with
a
cause
especially
a
good
one
quite
good
grew
on
me
as
the
glass
emptied
d
heavier
than
i
was
expecting
im
not
a
big
fan
of
wheat
beers
but
this
one
was
a
good
balance
with
the
lighter
pilsener
profile
the
abv
strength
was
very
deceptive
verdict
actually
halfway
decent
which
in
this
case
doesnt
mean
it
sucks
rather
its
something
to
try
when
you
need
to
quickly
run
to
the
store
and
grab
something
off
the
rack
dcrazy
good
pilsners
tend
to
be
one
of
my
least
favorite
but
this
one
makes
me
want
to
head
back
to
the
store
to
but
out
the
lot
especially
at
2
99
bomber
i
upped
the
drink
as
3
50
for
a
bomber
of
this
is
great
d
a
pretty
nice
pilsener
from
abita
the
wheat
adds
a
little
malt
subtlety
to
a
style
thats
normally
pretty
conventional
but
its
not
a
showstopper
still
this
drinks
pretty
smoothly
and
most
importantly
avoids
becoming
too
ciderysweet
for
such
a
relatively
alcoholic
lager
a
worthwhile
beer
that
supports
a
worthwhile
cause
nothing
wrong
with
that
overall
a
very
nice
pilsner
by
far
the
best
beer
i
have
had
from
abita
decent
pilsner
nothing
special
but
one
of
the
better
quality
abita
beers
ive
ever
tasted
d
very
standard
for
the
style
but
nothing
amazing
really
easy
to
drink
but
simple
flavor
pours
beautifully
with
dense
carbonation
and
a
generous
foamy
head
the
color
is
pale
gold
fresh
clean
smells
of
lemon
light
grain
and
malt
the
taste
is
great
in
fact
superior
to
any
abita
ive
had
and
i
tend
to
really
like
all
their
beers
rich
and
subtle
flavors
of
malt
slight
lemon
caramel
licorice
mint
and
floral
undertones
a
very
sturdy
yet
refreshing
beer
as
near
to
delicious
as
any
pilsner
or
lager
ive
ever
had
excellent
beer
and
highly
recommended
it
seems
like
maybe
a
limited
release
or
something
only
available
in
22oz
bottles
for
about
67
00
side
note
ive
been
to
nola
a
handful
of
times
and
it
is
an
amazing
city
not
the
biggest
fan
of
other
abita
offerings
but
this
is
pretty
good
and
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
to
visit
do
it
d
a
very
drinkable
beer
also
a
very
cool
idea
props
to
abita
on
that
pours
a
proteinhazed
straw
color
a
thin
white
head
rings
around
the
glass
a
bit
smells
fresh
and
sharp
like
a
cool
gulf
breeze
also
biscuity
and
spicy
really
get
some
nice
esters
on
the
top
of
the
taste
as
well
as
some
spicier
grape
notes
there
is
lemony
zest
too
and
the
malts
are
smooth
and
full
diggin
the
wheat
in
this
one
a
pleasant
mildly
sharp
bitterness
finishes
it
off
carbonated
nicely
great
body
drinkability
good
a
fine
beer
for
a
good
cause
pours
a
deep
straw
with
a
decent
finger
and
a
half
of
head
very
nice
lacing
good
amount
of
wheat
malt
in
the
nose
along
with
some
fresh
cut
grass
the
taste
is
a
very
wheat
heavy
german
pilsner
the
hops
dont
quite
balance
it
out
not
a
bad
pils
and
im
happy
to
say
i
tried
it
this
is
a
well
brewed
pilsener
clearly
worth
the
effort
my
pour
resulted
in
just
over
a
finger
of
thick
foamy
bonewhite
head
with
good
retention
the
sun
is
up
and
out
after
yesterdays
snow
storm
and
it
looked
like
liquid
sunshine
in
the
glass
deep
golden
in
color
with
a
light
haze
and
some
floaties
evident
in
keeping
with
the
unfiltered
part
of
the
description
nose
was
really
spicy
and
i
suddenly
realized
that
they
did
not
mention
anything
about
yeast
it
was
slightly
sweet
but
with
a
spiciness
that
could
only
be
yeastdriven
i
was
not
sneezing
so
it
was
agreeable
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
riot
of
tastes
on
the
tongue
initially
i
caught
a
peppery
spiciness
then
some
grassy
notes
followed
by
a
biscuit
flavor
the
finish
was
very
dry
very
peppery
very
refreshing
strike
two
for
the
woodman
on
this
day
opening
beers
much
better
suited
for
warmer
read
hot
weather
i
am
an
idiot
at
times
but
at
least
i
know
to
look
for
this
in
the
summer
if
it
is
still
available
dm
smooth
drinking
nice
bright
taste
light
airy
medium
carbonation
tingle
goes
down
nice
and
easy
good
money
gone
to
a
good
cause
while
im
not
big
on
abita
beers
i
was
surprised
with
this
one
hopefully
a
fair
amount
of
money
went
to
the
cause
at
822
oz
d
average
really
the
cause
this
brew
goes
toward
increases
its
drinkability
tm
crisp
and
a
little
dry
slightly
grainy
and
spicy
at
first
followed
by
a
nice
earthy
hop
flavor
a
great
dry
finish
and
overall
a
very
drinkable
beer
the
palate
is
dry
but
refreshing
i
know
the
abv
is
7
making
this
beer
by
most
peoples
standards
unsessionable
i
would
agree
with
their
logic
but
this
beer
tastes
very
sessionable
to
me
d
pretty
good
a
good
beer
overall
for
a
good
cause
i
like
my
pilz
to
be
a
lot
cleaner
and
crisper
but
i
still
enjoyed
this
one
quite
a
bit
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
of
2
fingers
clean
and
crisp
aroma
of
light
cereal
sweet
start
that
gives
way
to
a
slightly
sweet
bitter
ending
easy
drinking
and
very
light
its
a
little
sweet
though
the
drinkability
is
fine
but
for
the
abv
i
would
rather
up
the
style
and
profile
than
stick
to
a
pilsner
this
one
just
worked
for
me
the
citric
flavors
of
the
hops
and
the
bready
twang
of
the
wheat
and
pils
malts
combined
with
that
crisp
body
to
make
this
a
flavorful
and
easy
drinking
affair
i
think
that
the
lemon
and
wheat
in
particular
gave
this
a
breezy
summer
feel
that
i
enjoyed
i
could
see
myself
sipping
on
one
of
these
on
the
beach
this
is
a
worthy
beer
for
a
good
cause
pick
one
up
if
you
see
it
drinkability
is
ok
not
really
a
session
beer
and
its
not
pilsy
enough
for
me
im
glad
i
tried
it
i
appreciate
what
abita
is
doing
here
both
with
the
cause
and
the
beer
i
was
born
in
la
so
the
combination
of
the
brand
and
message
really
stikes
a
chord
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
too
filling
good
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
strong
than
average
pilsener
that
is
worth
drinking
for
a
long
time
poured
into
a
blue
moon
glass
there
was
nothing
atypical
looking
about
this
pilsner
bready
nose
smooth
mouthfeel
but
pretty
light
body
nothing
jumped
out
at
me
about
this
beer
but
then
again
it
was
a
bit
old
i
drank
this
for
new
years
and
when
i
purchased
it
it
was
a
dusty
bottle
i
dont
regret
it
though
worth
the
charity
grab
it
while
its
around
overall
a
worthy
beer
for
a
worthy
cause
d
a
decent
brew
not
my
preferred
style
but
good
nonetheless
d
good
beer
and
definitely
a
great
cause
not
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
though
the
pour
results
in
a
fluffy
offwhite
head
the
ale
is
a
nice
golden
hue
patchy
head
retention
and
good
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
are
sweet
malts
and
hop
spiciness
that
tickles
the
nose
dry
straw
i
pull
berries
from
the
aroma
and
they
seem
a
tad
out
of
place
but
theyre
not
unpleasant
by
any
means
the
carbonation
on
this
beer
is
pretty
low
at
least
lower
than
id
want
in
a
pils
the
flavors
are
sweet
corn
and
bitter
spicy
hops
not
much
complexity
in
the
flavor
the
beer
was
ok
but
i
saved
the
bottle
for
a
while
very
nice
art
this
looked
and
smelled
promising
but
wound
up
as
good
overall
not
worth
selling
your
first
edition
new
mutants
comic
for
bought
a
bomber
of
this
at
the
liquor
store
because
of
the
backstory
donation
to
help
clean
up
the
gulf
oil
spill
and
because
it
seemed
like
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
that
night
i
feel
that
i
made
the
right
decision
on
both
counts
poured
clear
straw
golden
with
a
short
cap
of
white
head
aromas
of
lemon
pale
malts
and
a
light
hoppiness
on
the
palate
crisp
and
drinkable
light
bodied
like
a
pumped
up
pils
with
more
bready
malt
a
little
honey
and
a
hint
of
lemon
d
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
the
relatively
high
especially
with
a
7
abvthat
fails
to
show
itsel
its
always
good
when
the
brewer
masks
the
alcohol
as
excellent
as
abita
has
done
with
this
one
not
my
style
but
certainly
something
i
would
recommend
to
a
macro
drinker
and
maybe
even
buy
for
myself
during
the
summer
slightly
hazed
golden
hue
with
a
fully
formed
thick
billowing
white
head
fine
speckled
lacing
left
behind
as
the
head
dwindles
down
lemongrass
herbal

very
nice
light

solid
pils
from
louisiana
upfront
citric
grassy
biscuit
malts
and
a
dry
yeast
finish
mouthfeel
is
light

even
carbonation
going
on
drinkability
all
day
effortless
beer
drinking
experience
d
this
is
lightertasting
than
the
7
abv
indicates
and
is
definitely
the
best
offering
ive
experienced
from
abita
its
light
on
the
tongue
with
nice
citrus
notes
and
not
syrupy
before
the
spike
of
the
sizzling
drier
hop
finish
its
very
drinkable
its
not
revelatory
but
a
well
above
average
pilsener
i
would
say
this
beer
is
yellow
in
color
but
i
guess
strawgold
sounds
better
with
solid
white
head
smell
is
subdued
and
quite
pleasant
full
of
flowery
hop
notes
there
is
a
definite
sweet
hoppy
bite
at
first
sip
but
overall
the
beer
is
light
and
refreshing
considering
its
alcohol
content
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
drinkability
nice
refreshing
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
giving
this
one
a
try
i
really
enjoyed
the
sos
pilsner
both
for
its
overall
drinkability
and
the
warming
sensation
i
started
to
feel
after
half
the
bottle
anything
with
7
and
higher
abv
is
perfect
for
getting
those
blood
vessels
closer
to
the
surface
of
my
skin
but
i
was
especially
happy
to
be
able
to
support
the
gulf
restoration
with
this
little
act
of
drinking
drinks
easy
the
abv
is
well
hidden
a
bit
more
complexity
wouldve
helped
the
cause
very
good
overall
but
i
have
to
ding
it
a
few
points
for
unnecessary
sweetness
neutral
flavors
work
well
for
a
pilsner
beer
but
keep
it
far
removed
from
greatness
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
the
relatively
high
7
abv
fails
to
show
itself
until
late
in
the
game
wherein
it
only
appears
after
an
entire
22ounce
bottle
as
a
bit
of
airiness
in
the
head
never
showing
itself
on
the
palate
id
swear
this
was
nothing
but
a
standard
americancraftmade
pils
but
a
bit
imperial
it
is
wonderfully
executed
and
quite
possibly
one
of
the
best
offerings
abita
has
put
into
bottle
subtle
complexity
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
a
good
pilsner
and
abita
can
certainly
check
that
one
off
its
list
and
in
an
imperial
variant
at
that
donly
reason
i
would
buy
again
is
because
of
the
money
they
are
giving
to
charity
i
love
a
well
made
pilsner
but
i
feel
the
wheat
gives
it
too
soft
of
a
flavor
way
too
nuetral
tasting
for
me
radiant

a
wisp
of

a

on

doughy

lighter
than
it
is
in
fact
its
surprisingly
light
overall
clean
fairly
smooth
mediumlight
bodied
not
bad
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
their
20th
anniversary
i
would
call
this
an
extremely
near
miss
but
a
miss
nonetheless
d
it
goes
down
ok
s
o
s
is
much
better
beer
than
abitas
other
highabv
offerings
andygator
and
abbey
ale
in
fact
its
right
up
there
with
their
best
even
though
the
shoreline
will
eventually
be
returned
to
normal

hoping
abc
has
the
good
sense
to
continue
to
brew

refreshing

nice

with
heavy

drinkability
is
very
nice
a
very
nice
german
pilsner
from
the
folks
at
abita
bottled
for
a
great
cause
go
out
and
get
one
not
for
me
although
they
nailed

i
bought
this
because
i
like
to
support
a
good
cause
nice
gold
color
big
head
this
is
my
first
abita
beer
smells
like
a
lager
for
sure
but
the
taste
is
thick
and
malty
easy
to
drink
but
a
little
strong
to
be
drinking
more
than
one
at
time
interesting
and
now
id
like
to
try
andygator
this
isnt
too
far
from
bmc
stuff
it
has
a
bit
more
flavor
and
some
nice
spiciness
in
the
nose
and
taste
but
it
still
has
that
musky
stale
malt
aftertaste
for
me
its
a
huge
hit
on
drinkability
others
may
like
it
d
fairly
easy
to
consume
though
you
wont
necessarily
be
wowed
over
in
the
process
worth
a
purchase
if
not
just
for
the
cause
75
donated
to
clean
up
in
the
gulf
this
beer
advertises
on
the
label
that
75
of
the
purchase
price
for
each
bottle
goes
toward
the
rescue
and
restoration
of
our
shores
that
alone
should
be
enough
for
you
to
purchase
a
bottle
or
two
of
this
brew
however
this
beer
offers
more
than
a
good
conscience
it
has
great
characteristic
and
is
a
fine
beer
seek
this
beer
out
and
drink
it
it
is
a
very
good
beer
read
the
bottle
postreview
apparently
this
is
a
weizen
pils
with
no
saaz
hops
explains
a
lot
this
is
not
a
pilsner
maybe
it
was
made
according
to
a
pilsner
formula
or
something
but
upon
tasting
the
finished
product
they
shouldve
realized
the
truth
and
called
it
something
else
overall
this
beer
should
help
abita
to
raise
plenty
of
donations
for
the
gulf
it
has
everything
i
love
about
german
pils
clean
malt
character
tasty
saaz
hops
crisp
mouthfeel
and
great
drinkability
cant
beat
the
price
either4
90
and
bomber
i
was
surprised
to
find
this
beer
for
sale
here
in
boise
idaho
i
bought
it
about
3
weeks
ago
and
i
saw
it
on
the
shelf
still
last
week
by
the
way
any
pilsner
weighing
in
at
7
or
more
is
a
double
in
my
book
overall
a
well
made
beer
and
worth
trying
with
that
in
mind
i
have
to
say
it
is
a
pretty
good
beer
for
a
good
cause
d
very
high
im
not
a
huge
consumer
of
pilsner
beers
but
this
one
goes
down
exceptionally
well
and
above
all
the
proceeds
go
to
a
worthwhile
cause
which
doesnt
make
the
beer
taste
better
but
definitely
makes
me
feel
better
along
with
its
7
abv
well
brewed
in
my
opinion
and
definitely
seek
it
out
while
my
impresson
of
this
beer
may
be
skewed
to
the
favorable
as
the
selection
of
beers
available
in
the
bourbon
street
area
is
a
bit
monotonous
i
have
to
think
that
the
low
reviews
of
the
beer
must
be
bad
bottles
because
of
the
three
i
had
during
my
visit
all
were
consistently
notbad
a
welcome
dose
of
hops
with
a
distinct
wheat
background
character
lively
and
reasonably
smooth
it
was
the
highlight
of
my
nola
beerdrinking
experience
d
great
gimmick
for
abita
i
feel
like
ive
really
given
back
to
the
gulf
community
by
buying
this
blasphemy
of
a
beer
maybe
if
louisiana
can
suffer
more
calamity
abita
could
find
impetus
for
more
special
releases
i
dont
know
that
ive
had
a
pilsner
made
with
wheat
or
if
i
have
never
this
pronounced
traditionalist
may
balk
but
it
does
work
out
and
the
best
part
about
this
beer
is
the
charitable
aspect
i
thorougly
respect
their
initiative
to
help
restore
the
coast
from
damage
from
the
bp
oil
spill
frankly
they
could
have
brewed
a
cheaper
product
and
people
still
would
have
bought
it
for
the
causes
but
instead
they
really
made
a
decent
quality
pilsner
which
i
would
be
happy
to
drink
most
anytime
and
plan
to
again
not
bad
at
all
i
dont
think
that
the
wheat
malt
and
pils
malt
seem
to
agree
with
each
other
here
a
mixed
bag
of
flavor
slainte
label
notes
say
this
is
a
weizen
pilsner
dont
think
ive
heard
of
the
term
anyway
this
one
is
for
a
good
cause
and
its
pretty
well
done
and
certainly
very
drinkable
actually
it
compares
rather
favorably
to
the
excellent
lammsbrau
organic
pilsner
that
finished
the
session
sos
is
a
decent
beer
especially
if
you
like
big
malty
lagers
its
a
shame
this
is
only
a
special
release
and
doesnt
come
in
12
oz
bottles
i
could
see
this
being
a
good
anytime
beer
drinkability
is
good
this
is
an
interesting
beer
rich
tasting
and
creamy
with
a
nice
dollop
of
hops
at
the
end
poured
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
was
a
golden
amber
with
a
slightly
off
white
head
head
was
1
finger
didnt
last
long
but
left
amounts
of
lacing
on
the
top
and
a
bit
of
clinging
to
the
sides
aroma
was
slightly
hoppy
and
citrusy
a
touch
of
both
lemon
and
orange
citrus
taste
was
prominently
hops
slightly
piney
towards
the
end
as
it
warmed
up
citrus
could
also
be
tasted
felt
thin
and
watery
in
the
mouth
not
at
all
carbonated
fairly
easy
to
drink
could
go
down
well
during
the
warm
months
dbecomes
less
complex
but
stays
very
refreshing
overall
this
is
very
well
balanced
but
not
full
of
too
many
robust
flavors
it
is
rather
light
and
masks
its
strength
very
well
certainly
one
to
drink
again
and
i
bet
is
nice
on
tap
nice
that
75c
of
each
bottle
goes
towards
the
environmental
effort
of
the
spill
in
the
gulf
verdict
at
the
end
of
the
day
s
o
s
is
a
simple
but
enjoyable
brew
that
should
be
palatable
for
craft
newbies
and
veterans
alike
perfect
given
its
role
at
first
i
wasnt
quite
convinced
but
by
the
end
of
the
bottle
i
was
ready
for
another
d
this
is
a
very
good
pils
and
it
doesnt
hurt
that
it
goes
to
a
good
cause
this
is
not
nearly
as
aggressively
hoppy
as
it
could
be
with
the
pilsner
moniker
on
the
label
i
expected
a
more
hop
leaning
beer
this
beer
has
an
ample
malt
backbone
and
the
subtler
hop
character
makes
this
more
of
a
hoppy
hellerbock
to
me
it
is
actually
a
bit
simplistic
in
both
the
hop
and
grain
department
in
the
end
though
still
this
is
not
bad
and
worth
a
try
and
the
cause
is
certainly
a
good
thing
happy
to
help
send
a
few
pennies
las
way
via
a
tasty
beer
well
done
abita
mouthfeel
is
medium
with
a0
crisp
amount
of
carbonation
if
abita
cranked
out
something
like
this
regularly
in
six
pack
availability
id
be
happy
to
have
it
around
regularly
a
good
pilsner
is
always
welcome
in
my
fridge
and
this
is
a
good
pilsner
poured
a
22oz
bottle
into
my
tripel
karmeliet
tulip
this
is
a
pretty
pilsner
nice
golden
wheat
color
with
a
ample
frothy
white
head
that
leaves
soapy
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
honestly
this
is
a
top
notch
pilsner
in
terms
of
appearance
quite
a
looker
taking
a
big
whiff
right
after
pouring
it
gives
a
impression
of
sweet
fruits
ripe
pears
and
sweet
fuji
apples
just
a
bit
of
sweet
caramel
and
yeasty
bread
just
a
hint
of
spicegrass
from
the
hops
but
nothing
over
powering
the
flavor
is
just
a
little
off
there
is
a
generic
sweetness
that
just
a
bit
off
putting
almost
a
cream
corn
minus
the
corn
still
get
over
ripe
pears
with
just
a
little
bit
of
bread
slight
grassy
hops
come
through
at
the
very
tail
honestly
with
most
pilsners
i
just
really
want
them
to
be
clean
and
crisp
and
this
throwing
a
18
instead
of
a
bullseye
still
a
good
score
but
not
quite
what
you
needed
the
mouthfeel
is
honestly
the
one
thing
that
really
irks
me
it
just
finished
to
sweet
and
full
i
want
lighter
styles
to
finished
dry
like
sandpaper
this
just
misses
the
dart
board
i
see
what
they
did
here
and
really
commend
abita
for
it
really
they
made
a
beer
that
a
lot
of
people
will
like
and
buy
and
for
that
ill
buy
more
not
mindblowing
but
definitely
pleasing
and
would
make
for
an
excellent
session
finished
the
bottle
easily
quite
satisfied
the
palate
is
surprisingly
muted
i
think
the
florida
heat
wasnt
particularly
kind
to
this
beer
theres
a
mild
hop
character
up
front
with
a
blend
of
orange
lemon
peel
and
earth
this
is
actually
pretty
delicate
im
reminded
of
the
complexity
of
orange
blossom
honey
minus
the
sweetness
obviously
the
grain
character
is
rather
rustic
here
theres
a
blend
of
wheat
and
raw
pilsnerlike
character
here
a
little
sweetness
is
present
in
the
midpalate
but
the
finish
does
dry
up
leaving
a
rather
excellent
and
delicate
hop
character
a
little
earth
a
little
orange
peel
curacao
and
a
little
sweetness
are
all
rather
expertly
in
balance
here
the
use
of
the
wheat
malt
has
lent
a
little
heft
to
the
palate
carbonation
is
light
enhancing
the
softness
that
the
dextrinous
wheat
character
thats
present
a
wisp
of
alcohol
appears
on
occasion
but
all
told
this
is
a
pretty
solid
beer
id
drink
this
again
d
gets
better
with
each
sip
but
nothing
really
unique
still
a
step
above
a
standard
pilsener
especially
at
its
7
00
abv
drinkability
relatively
so
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
one
was
quite
enjoyable
and
the
fact
it
is
for
a
good
cause
makes
it
taste
that
much
better
thanks
again
to
optimator13
for
this
beer
very
nicely
done
beer
found
this
at
brix
in
omaha
great
looking
painted
bomber
pilsners
arent
usually
my
thing
but
i
figured
that
considering
the
cause
i
could
give
this
one
a
go
hats
off
to
abita
who
came
up
with
this
idea
this
is
a
22
ounce
bomber
im
pouring
it
into
a
big
ass
pilsner
glass
pours
with
a
two
inch
huge
billowing
frothy
head
the
head
leaves
behind
some
serious
lacing
gigantic
bubbles
and
foam
from
this
one
likewise
carbonation
is
huge
with
fizz
seemingly
going
on
for
days
pours
cloudy
which
isnt
surprising
considering
this
is
an
unfiltered
beer
color
is
a
bright
gold
brilliant
like
the
sun
aroma
is
pretty
hefty
especially
for
a
pilsner
with
cereal
notes
and
lemongrass
in
the
nose
pretty
solid
amount
of
bitterness
in
this
one
its
pleasant
though
lively
mouthfeel
with
a
high
amount
of
pleasant
carbonation
and
a
pretty
slick
mouthfeel
taste
is
spot
on
light
malt
starts
before
giving
way
to
grassy
and
fruity
hop
character
bitterness
teases
the
palate
before
giving
way
to
a
sweet
honey
finish
the
biscuity
malt
sweetness
really
helps
to
hide
the
7
abv
which
i
cant
seem
to
really
find
really
crisp
and
refreshing
take
on
the
pilsner
style
kudos
to
abita
for
supporting
a
good
cause
by
putting
together
a
great
beer
this
is
a
decent
brew
for
a
great
cause
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
that
also
has
plenty
of
flavor
i
would
rate
it
5
stars
but
that
would
only
be
for
its
cause
pours
a
slightly
hazy
straw
color
with
a
pillowy
pure
white
head
that
dissipated
into
a
solid
cap
the
head
left
a
sheet
of
webby
lacing
all
around
the
glass
the
aroma
is
of
grassyspicy
hops
perhaps
some
citrus
nice
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
is
of
a
light
malt
slightly
fruity
with
a
grassy
and
limey
hop
flavor
not
dry
like
most
pils
its
different
but
does
take
on
a
pilsner
character
the
feel
is
light
with
tingly
carbonation
not
very
crisp
but
easily
drinkable
and
refreshing
this
is
a
very
solid
beer
nice
hop
flavor
i
would
drink
it
again
the
body
was
light
but
wellrounded
and
smooth
drinkability
was
pretty
good
i
could
see
having
a
couple
of
these
at
a
sitting
overall
a
nice
little
brew
that
abita
should
perhaps
consider
producing
on
a
yearly
if
not
even
yearround
basis
when
i
saw
this
one
come
into
the
store
i
was
happy
to
pick
one
up
since
some
proceeds
were
going
to
a
good
cause
pours
a
somewhat
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
that
fell
slowly
leaving
behind
a
patchwork
of
lace
aroma
is
very
simple
and
straightforward
mostly
pale
grains
in
the
nose
a
touch
of
wheat
in
there
which
gives
it
a
slight
twang
and
herbal
grassy
hops
taste
is
very
similar
im
picking
up
on
lot
of
citrusy
hop
notes
but
its
not
bitter
in
anyway
theres
some
orange
lemon
and
a
touch
of
grass
but
overall
the
hops
are
very
well
balanced
with
the
pale
malts
that
make
this
beer
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
for
such
a
high
abv
body
is
medium
but
could
use
a
touch
more
carbonation
to
add
soome
crispness
overall
a
good
beer
for
a
very
worthy
cause
drinkability
this
is
hands
down
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
abita
and
one
of
the
best
americanmade
german
pils
right
behind
prima
and
kaiser
and
that
amazing
example
i
had
from
the
obscure
baron
brewing
i
am
forever
down
on
supposed
big
or
imperial
pils
because
the
pils
is
meant
to
be
light
and
show
an
ease
of
drinking
but
this
one
is
both
big
yet
true
to
the
spirit
of
the
style
im
not
often
blown
away
by
a
beer
these
days
closing
in
on
2000
reviews
in
the
last
7
years
but
this
one
knocked
my
socks
off
well
done
abita
d
a
simple
but
good
beer
that
opens
up
quite
a
bit
as
it
warms
the
alcohol
is
well
hidden
nice
d
if
i
wasnt
distracted
by
the
meal
it
would
be
gone
faster
also
it
goes
to
a
good
cause
abita
is
usually
miss
for
me
but
this
is
surprisingly
good
worth
a
buy
especially
since
this
beer
is
for
a
good
cause
overall
a
very
solid
beer
not
the
biggest
fan
of
big
pilsners
but
the
hops
help
this
one
to
work
would
not
mind
having
this
one
again
at
all
taste
is
very
mellow
well
balanced
malty
and
hoppy
with
a
slight
alcohol
bite
thats
cool
since
its
imperial
very
creamy
and
rich
lots
caramel
and
sweet
flavors
very
good
beer
wasnt
sure
what
to
expect
from
this
one
i
havent
had
a
lot
of
pilsners
that
really
lifted
my
luggage
but
im
impressed
well
done
without
being
overdone
i
think
ill
finish
the
bomber
drinkability
for
charitys
sake
im
going
to
give
this
a
charitable
bump
in
the
drinkability
section
not
bad
by
any
stretch
but
i
wasnt
thrilled
either
a
pretty
darn
solid
pilsner
all
around
that
i
could
down
at
least
a
couple
of
bottles
of
if
i
were
in
the
mood
also
a
big
nod
to
the
charitable
aspect
of
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
moderate
drinkability
is
decent
it
was
a
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
it
had
some
decent
grainmalt
flavors
to
it
but
wasnt
anything
special
overall
an
easy
drinker
on
a
hot
day
though
the
hops
are
nice
and
refreshing
a
little
pineapple
juice
and
grassy
aroma
and
flavor
but
theyre
not
enough
to
save
this
beer
from
being
average
m
slick
finish
to
it
kind
of
syrupy
in
the
finish
a
bit
odd
in
this
regard
a
very
nice
pils
and
the
highest
abv
pils
ive
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
up
to
this
point
d
topnotch
for
the
style
great
flavor
going
on
but
hard
to
describe
the
taste
try
it
if
you
can
find
it
this
is
a
nice
flavorful
pilsner
drinks
easy
and
never
gets
dull
nor
does
it
ever
become
overpowering
a
bit
high
of
an
abv
or
i
would
be
chugging
this
d
this
seemed
like
a
nice
idea
that
just
didnt
quite
pan
out
for
me
not
so
bad
i
wanted
to
dump
it
but
at
the
same
time
i
wont
go
for
it
again
anyways
i
hope
my
75
cents
can
do
some
good
d
a
very
easy
to
drink
decent
pilsener
some
nice
wheat
and
citrus
would
try
again
pours
a
golden
body
with
great
carbonation
that
leads
to
a
small
head
with
lace
patches
along
w
minor
pils
malt
smell
with
an
edge
of
sweet
malt
and
some
fruitlike
hops
an
easy
to
drink
pils
w
pils
malt
giving
off
some
slight
fruit
flavors
and
there
is
a
touch
of
wheat
twang
that
gives
off
a
spicy
and
citric
backbite
balances
w
other
fruit
flavors
and
there
is
some
minor
sweetness
a
beer
that
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
but
just
doesnt
completely
click
interesting
beer
and
a
charity
beer
for
the
louisiana
oil
spill
no
need
to
stock
up
on
this
one
d
this
was
a
pretty
good
pilsner
that
was
bigger
in
hops
and
body
than
most
other
beers
in
its
class
it
hid
the
alcohol
well
also
so
it
was
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
delicious
but
definitely
enjoyable
d
overall
a
pretty
decent
beer
for
an
excellent
cause
worth
a
shot
support
this
cause
as
with
restoration
ale
kudos
are
due
to
abita
for
again
brewing
something
meaningful
first
an
ale
to
help
nola
recover
from
the
negligence
of
the
army
corps
of
engineers
and
now
a
lager
to
save
the
region
from
the
greed
of
bp
this
bottle
caught
my
eye
in
the
store
with
its
nice
design
1
pint
6fl
oz
beer
beer
pours
with
a
nice
1
finger
head
appearance
is
a
cloudy
version
of
your
standard
macro
lager
color
although
it
looks
like
your
typical
lager
the
smell
was
a
nice
surprise
definitely
some
hops
present
the
taste
was
really
crisp
and
flavorful
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
easy
to
drink
and
supporting
a
good
cause
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
notes
the
cause
alone
might
be
worth
promoting
the
brew
but
the
beer
is
pretty
decent
maybe
to
reach
a
broader
public
doing
a
quality
and
selfcontained
pilsner
is
a
good
move
and
while
not
memorable
it
is
pleasing
and
nice
to
push
around
opinion
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
that
i
wouldnt
mind
at
all
picking
up
again
to
help
the
cause
even
though
the
water
seems
to
a
bit
mineralladen
in
the
nose
it
is
only
moderately
noticeable
in
the
flavor
the
malt
and
hop
profiles
are
appropriate
for
the
style
it
is
a
bit
big
and
meaty
for
the
style
but
this
isnt
a
problem
it
is
still
a
well
presented
beer
all
in
all
this
is
an
ok
brew
nothing
special
try
it
to
support
the
gulf
clean
up
but
otherwise
not
worth
your
taste
buds
not
as
soft
as
most
pilsnersthe
hop
is
harsher
and
more
bitter
with
strong
grapefruit
notes
round
mouthfeel
as
if
this
were
an
ale
the
carbonation
is
lighter
the
malt
flavors
are
secondary
the
aftertaste
has
a
mild
sourness
but
its
predominately
bitter
if
theres
one
new
style
of
beer
i
think
is
either
a
mistake
or
must
be
very
tough
to
pull
off
its
imperial
pilsners
interesting
winelike
smell
to
this
one
which
is
promising
the
pilsner
and
wheat
malts
work
pretty
well
together
here
lingering
hop
bitterness
doesnt
seem
like
7
overall
not
bad
and
makes
me
rethink
this
style
a
bit
cheers
to
abita
for
doing
this
charitable
beer
poured
into
a
12
liter
stein
a
clear
light
to
medium
golden
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
that
settled
very
very
slowly
leaving
globs
of
broken
lace
behind
a
great
mix
of
yeasty
fruitinessand
spicy
hop
in
the
nosea
tinge
of
iron
from
the
malt
comes
in
to
play
as
welljust
a
great
mix
lightly
toasted
wheat
malt
flavors
along
with
some
sharpness
from
the
healthy
dose
of
hopslight
caramel
sweetness
as
well
airy
mouthfeel
makes
it
glide
down
easywow
this
is
a
great
breweasily
the
best
thing
i
have
had
from
abitaa
brewery
i
dont
go
to
often
a
great
cause
and
a
great
beer
in
my
opinion
overall
s
o
s
is
a
real
surprise
from
abita
a
quite
solid
boozywheaty
pils
that
drinks
well
and
donates
75
cents
to
the
gulf
restoration
for
each
bottle
sold
i
can
dig
it
d
an
excellent
pils
dont
notice
the
7
abv
at
all
overall
eh
i
think
ive
said
enough
on
this
one
if
you
like
pilsners
why
not
sure
give
it
a
try
amazing
designsartwork
on
the
bottle
and
it
was
for
a
good
cause
so
im
still
glad
i
bought
this
dynamic
this
is
not
but
its
agreeable
generally
tasty
if
plain
and
charitable
cant
root
against
it
the
feel
of
this
beer
has
a
nice
light
body
and
really
has
a
well
managed
feel
that
goes
down
well
bur
does
not
have
too
much
or
a
disagreeable
feel
had
this
from
a
22oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
carbonation
is
high
tight
white
head
with
a
pale
straw
color
slightly
hazy
the
aroma
is
grassy
with
crisp
notes
of
saaz
hops
the
taste
i
had
this
with
a
true
southern
pulled
pork
meal
of
collards
and
black
beans
is
big
for
a
pilsner
the
taste
holds
up
against
big
fatty
foods
it
would
probably
do
well
with
some
cheeses
or
really
spicy
fish
dishes
the
body
is
medium
and
the
hops
do
coat
the
tongue
in
the
after
taste
i
highly
recommend
this
as
a
beer
and
to
help
the
locals
anyway
possible
gotta
love
a
bomber
of
tasty
quality
beer

some

then
a
nice

bite
that
lingers
to
the
finish
an
interesting
medley
of
flavors
that
keep
you
wanting
anothother
sip
seemingly
lightbodied
for
the
abv
and
pretty
refreshing
as
well
an
interesting
brew
and
hey
its
for
a
good
cause
m
d
medium
bodied
with
a
crisp
and
snappy
carbonation
that
complements
both
the
aroma
and
the
flavour
nicely
some
of
the
soft
peppery
notes
of
the
alcohol
work
nicely
with
the
spiciness
in
the
hops
and
a
modest
warming
follows
it
all
down
id
put
it
down
as
a
refreshing
sipper
and
its
certainly
a
beer
i
think
i
will
be
revisiting
a
few
more
times
while
it
is
available
actually
a
really
nice
drink
that
would
go
well
with
lots
of
food
profiles
a
bit
of
a
refined
and
reserved
saison
character
for
lack
of
a
better
description
very
drinkable
overall
a
good
beer
for
the
price
i
wouldnt
go
running
back
to
it
time
and
again
but
if
i
were
going
to
the
beach
i
would
take
this
one
along
it
was
drinkable
because
the
flavors
were
very
mellow
worth
a
try
beer
is
medium
bodied
and
light
in
character
bright
in
the
mouth
and
slightly
bitter
at
the
end
it
was
a
good
lager
overall
and
i
would
have
it
again
im
not
sure
ive
had
a
semicharitable
beer
before
so
im
not
sure
what
to
expect
here
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
thick
wad
of
white
froth
which
almost
etches
the
glass
as
it
dies
away
the
nose
comprises
clean
florals
very
light
citrus
a
hint
of
coriander
and
a
soft
grainy
quality
the
taste
is
just
as
clean
and
simple
though
a
bit
more
wheat
finds
its
way
on
the
buds
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
a
very
nice
if
somewhat
ordinary
pils
but
very
easygoing
and
extremely
drinkable
i
hope
it
sells
enough
to
do
some
good
for
the
gulf
very
drinkable
beer
with
more
flavor
than
many
pilseners
could
really
get
in
trouble
with
23
pints
of
this
because
the
7
abv
hides
so
well
pretty
cool
that
i
could
enjoy
the
beer
and
donate
75
cents
towards
the
gulf
relief
effort
at
the
same
time
22oz
bomber
into
a
hopus
glass
pours
a
crisp
straw
yellow
with
a
decent
frothy
off
white
head
that
diminishes
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
slight
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
slight
sweet
pale
malts
the
taste
is
a
nice
amount
of
sweet
malts
against
a
sturdy
citrus
hop
backbone
that
leaves
a
nice
subtly
bitter
citrus
finish
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
decent
smoothing
carbonation
this
is
certainly
a
beer
worth
trying
especially
a
percentage
of
the
proceeds
going
to
such
a
good
cause
drinkability
sure
its
a
little
high
on
the
alcohol
but
thankfully
it
doesnt
stray
too
terribly
far
towards
unrefreshing
cloying
territories
overall
a
good
beer
for
a
good
cause
you
know
its
nice
to
occasionally
use
my
evident
alcoholism
for
the
forces
of
good
md
full
body
and
ends
a
bit
more
sticky
than
most
in
the
style
not
really
sweet
but
there
is
obviously
a
little
more
residual
sugar
in
there
the
only
thing
i
can
fault
them
for
is
that
its
out
of
the
style
guidelines
but
it
doesnt
bother
me
besides
the
lack
of
drinkability

the
taste
is
just
not

im
not

it

skunkyness
of
this
beer
overrides
and
good
qualities
everything
was
fine
with
this
beer
until
i
took
a
drink
the
malty
taste
just
didnt
work
with
the
underlying

i
enjoyed
this

it
is
light

normal

there
isnt
nothing
special
i
had
his
on
draught
not
out
of
a

and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
not
quite
sure
why
this
has
such
a
low
rating
probably
my
favorite
pilsner
easy
drinking
clean
so
agreeable
with
me
a
very
happy
beer
overall
refreshing
and
very
smooth
slightly
watered
down
tasting
but
hey
still
one
id
pick
up
to
try
again
months
from
now
average
it
was
nice
knowing
you
warsteiner
ill
meet
up
with
you
again
if
i
ever
get
the
deutchland
ive
had
this
several
times
and
like
it
each
time
its
a
mild
malt
and
undertone
of
hops
fused
well
with
light
roast
flavor
theres
many
up
and
down
opinions
of
this
brew
my
advice
is
to
get
a
6
pack
and
try
it
also
try
it
with
some
good
pretzels
or
my
favorite
pairing
for

this
is
a
solid

offering
from

crisp

light
with
a
slightly
off
skunk
aroma
the
taste
is
very
pleasing
if
you
like
american
domestics
would
highly
recommend
you
try
this
beer
if
you
enjoy
slightly
sweet
less
hoppy
yet
still
malty
tastes
echoing
todd
who
said
its
a
no
frills
beer
but
something
nice
and
clean
to
switch
to
now
and
then
a
great
nonwheat
summer
beer
overall
crisp
slightly

would
buy
this
a

over

clean
beer
no

almost
like
an
american
domestic
but
still
very
good
clean
crisp
perfectly
balanced
german
pils
the
taste
lingers
on
despite
the
rather
light
body
the
color
is
a
gorgeous
golden
hue
with
perfect
carbonation
levels
although
the
head
retention
was
just
about
non
existent
there
is
very
little
aroma
i
certainly
sensed
that
i
was
indulging
in
a
mix
of
pilsner
and
munich
malts
balanced
with
noble
hops
a
very
difficult
style
to
nail
but
this
beer
is
more
than
solid
hop
heads
need
not
apply
i
had
this
with
a
spicy
cajun
shrimp
dish
and
it
was
perfect
o
very
drinkable
but
fairly
uncomplicated
final
thoughts
everyones
had
at
least
one
socalled
pilsener
in
their
life
most
of
the
mass
produced
beer
on
the
market
calls
itself
a
pilsener
but
is
in
fact
made
with
adjuncts
hats
off
to
warsteiner
for
keeping
things
authentic
with
premium
verum
would
i
drink
it
again
sure
there
is
a
time
and
a
place
for
this
particular
brew
and
it
just
so
happens
to
be
summertime
now
at
4
8
it
is
a
smooth
light
lager
a
great
german
summer
beer
overall
not
super
flavorful
but
a
smooth

this
brew
looks
like
most
brews
on
the
market
the
smell
is
rich
with
grains
also
some
sweetness
in
the
smell
the
taste
to
this
brew
is
rich
and
bold
but
also
smooth
im
picking
up
some
sweetness
like
camel
or

warsteiner
premium

goes
down
real

im
really
liking
this
brew
this
is
a
well
balance
brew
nothing
over
powering
in
this
brew
overall
im
giving
this
brew
a
solid
4
out
of
5
this
is
better
than
what
i
expected
i
will
by
this
brew
again
overall
a
3

for
warsteiner
premium

from
warsteiner
brauerei
i
was
glad
to
pick
a
lighter
true
german
brew
for
these
nearswampy
days
i
will
surely
buy
this
brew
again
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
87
clear
light
golden
pour
with
an
immense
head
good
lacing
and
retention
for
a
pilsner
the
nose
is
a
light
biscuit
sweetness
over
just
a
touch
of
hops
light
medium
body
with
normal
carbonation
which
effervesces
a
bit
on
the
finish
the
flavor
profile
is
low
key
yet
nicely
balanced
it
begins
with
a
slight
biscuit
that
flows
into
a
slight
bitterness
against
a
slightly
sweet
background
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
pleasant
light
bitterness
that
lingers
a
bit
i
would
definitely
have
again
and
recommend
a
very
drinkable
and
tasty
pilsener
i
also
love
to
have
one
of
these
whenever
i
can
o
enjoyable
and
worth
having

and
repeat

aftertaste
overall
a
pleasant
beer
nothing
overwhelming
but
also
nothing
memorable
i
love
the
taste
not
too
sweet
or
bitter
and
its
an
overall
stronger
flavor
of
course
than
american
style
lagers
i
usually
drink
it
straight
from
the
bottle
a
little
cooler
than
room
temp
my
only
gripe
is
that
under
those
conditions
it
nearly
always
overflows
out
of
the
top
upon
being
opened
foam
may
look
good
in
the
tv
spots
but
when
theres
enough
to
shave

too
much
others
may
disagree
i
prefer
bitburger
but
thats
not

nothing

my

very
plain

flat

clean

beer
ookay
pilsner
but
nothing
special
states
that
its
made
with

not

and
it
tastes
like
it
somewhat
flat
and
rounded
enjoy
warsteiner
pils
in
my
opinion
is
an
overly
mild
beer
it
is
a
good
pilsner
in
the
sense
that
it
is
worth
the
money
you
pay
for
it
and
it
is
enjoyable
however
i
prefer
the
competition
namely
bitburger
the
hops
are
just
not
aggressive
enough
for
my
taste
the
malt
flavor
is
similarly
soft
dont
get
me
wrong
i
dont
think
warsteiner
is
bad
its
brewed
for
those
who
enjoy
a
softer
pils
i
however
do
not
belong
to
that
group
all
that
said
i
do
like
this
beer
brilliant
straw
with
a
prominent
white
head
that
slips
down
to
a
lasting
sheet
smells
lightly
fruity
and
dusty
with
a
doughy
sweetness
and
some
floral
hops
taste
is
mostly
all
pale
malt
sweetness
but
some
vague
grassy
husky
hops
show
up
towards
the
end
clean
light
and
pretty
crisp
which
helps
with
the
drinkability
not
too
bad
as
a
refreshing
beverage
but
bland
and
uninteresting
certainty
there
are
much
better
options
out
there
to
get
your
german
pils
fix
overall
its
clean
like
lindsay
lohan
after
a
shot
of
weak
grass
but
still
not
exactly
clean

pint
glass
hops
come
out
most
int
he
nose
with
lots
of
jasmine
and
tea
malt
smells
crisp
but
has
a
bit
of
graininess
to
it
has
a
bit
of
a
brothiness
in
the
nose
which
is
odd
the
flavor
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
as
the
hops
come
up
flat
and
poorly
mix
with
the
overall
sweet
malty
body
carbonation
needs
to
be
more
lively
in
the
mouthfeel
im
sure
this
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
brewed
with
barley
malt
and
hop
extract
best
before

it
pours
very
pale
gold
with
light
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
white
head
that
leaves
moderate
lacing
mild
grassy
and
spicyskunky
hops
in
the
nose
but
a
straight
up
pilsner
style
that
is
easy
to
enjoy
nothing
fancy
it
pours
a
pale
light
straw
color
with
a
good
head
its
a
little
flowery
and
grassy
in
the
smell
this
isnt
in
a
green
body
but
after
i
tasted
the
first
beer
i
sure
didnt
mind
going
for
more
it
has
a
thick
head
with
good
taste
and
good
finish
probally
not
going
to
be
one
of
my
standbys
but
sure
wouldnt
mind
drinking
one
again

is

though
it

just

soft
tasting
though
thankfully
grassyearthiness
warsteiner
is
an
old
favourite
it
pours
a
wonderful
pale
gold
with
a
foamy
white
head
into
my
mug
smell
well
it
smells
faintly
of
hops
and
a
little
apple

smell
is
certainly
not
its
strong
point
taste
though
is
really
good
and
very
smooth
with
a
crisp
hoppynutty
finish
this
is
a
session
beer
great
for
sitting
out
on
the
balcony
on
a
summers
day
i
could
definitely
drink
this
all
night
i
should
have
bought
more
predominantly
it
has
the
sour
and
metallic
smell
i
equate
with
beers
i
cant
stomach
it
has
a
very
light
malt
odor
with
faint
sweetness
the
moderate
body
comes
with
a
crispy
carbonation
and
mouth
feel
a
grainy
cut
hay
or
grassy
flavor
first
hits
your
tongue
this
is
the
flavor
ive
had
lately
most
notably
with
dfh
lawnmower
which
i
dont
like
in
beers
however
it
is
muted
here
and
finishes
clean
and
dry
although
definitely
filtered
the
more
complex
flavor
is
enough
to
keep
it
above
most
run
of
the
mill
macro
pilsners
out
there
it
went
well
with
a
seafood
appetizer
but
didnt
hold
up
to
a
filet
with
creamy
artichoke
sauce
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
above
average
either
i
was
a
bit
dissapointed
with
it
because
of
that
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
but
you
could
say
that
about
pbr
the
tagline
of
their
advertising
is
lifes
too
short
to
drink
cheap
beer
well
i
got
news
for
you
lifes
too
short
to
pay
a
premium
for
average
beer
the
finish
was
nice
with
an
eveness
through
the
aftertaste
the
body
was
medium
light
i
remember
buying
a
minikeg
of
this
stuff
years
ago
and
it
wasnt
bad
but
this
bottle
was
not
good
57
fizzy
light
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
on
a
hot
september
day
but
hardly
lives
up
to
its
slogan
because
life
is
too
short
to
drink
cheap
beer
not
a
bad
beer
in
any
way
it
has
the
germal
feel
and
taste
a
casual
or
uneducayed
beer
drinker
minght
not
fully
apreciate
a
beer
like
this
but
i
find
it
to
be
enjoyable
dark
flavorful
hoppy
with
some
biterness
not
skunky
but
quite
refreshing
for
a
darker
brand
of
beer
pours
a
plae
golden
pilsener
color

large

head
when
poured

with
a
fair
dosage
of

present
as
well
good

and
a
slightly
hoppy
and
astringent
dry
finish
very
drinkable
and
wellcarbonated
a
good
session
pils
oelergud
final
thought
cincinnati
imports
warsteiner
and
granted
its
a
little
overrated
as
to
the
liking
of
other
german
greats
like
weihenstephaner
spaten
and
franizkaner
this
stuff
is
a
little
mellower
and
still
pretty
damn
good
im
not
in
the
mood
for
another
but
i
will
be
again
an
ordinary
nothing
special
german
beer
the
back
of
the
label
says
because
life
is
too
short
to
drink
cheap
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
minimal
thin
white
head
there
is
ample
carbonation
the
aroma
is
faintly
banana
like
the
taste
is
somewhat
bland
at
first
but
follows
up
with
a
grassy
aftertaste
i
have
noticed
that
this
beer
has
gained
some
popularity
in
the
major
grocery
stores
but
i
think
its
only
because
its
made
in
germany
so
so
drinkability

this
palatecleansing
pils
went
down
just
fine
i
would
definitely
buy
again
i
used
to
like
this
beer
a
lot
before
i
knew
anything
about
beer
i
made
the
mistake
of
pouring
it
into
a
glass
one
day
this
beer
is
one
shade
darker
than
water
i
remember
being
so
shocked
at
the
color
i
expected
a
much
darker
beer
no
lasting
head
to
speak
of
i
have
to
say
it
is
smooth
pretty
drinkable
medium
carbonation
smell
is
fairly
nondescript
grain
malt
hops
taste
is
the
same
way
the
word
basic
comes
to
mind
even
slightly
watery
not
a
bad
beer
though
overall
it
is
a
nice
crisp
german
pilsner
that
is
a
good
alternative
to
the
typical
american
lager
its
easy
to
find
and
not
all
that
pricey
a
good
german
pils
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
one
poured
a
medium
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
did
not
stick
around
for
long
and
did
note
leave
much
in
the
way
of
lace
the
dominant
smell
was
malt
but
just
enough
hop
in
there
for
you
to
notice
the
taste
was
similar
with
a
good
malt
flavor
but
the
hops
kicked
in
at
the
finnish
to
balance
everything
out
mix
that
with
a
good
mouthfeel
and
this
is
a
great
beer
to
drink
with
some
brats
off
the
bbq
in
these
warm
summer
months
bottle
poured
a
golden
beer
with
a
small
head
with
almost
no
retention
aroma
is
very
weak
with
small
touch
of
malt
and
sweet
coming
out
of
my
glass
taste
is
also
very
weak
almost
watery
with
no
hops
detectable
very
bland
and
boring
pilsner
i
guess
this
could
be
an
ok
session
beer
on
a
beach
down
south
still
all
and
all
a
clean
smooth
drinking
beer
in
my
opinion
a
great
beer
with
german
style
food
this
is
a
pilsner
done
right
pours
the
typical
pale
straw
yellow
but
the
frothy
head
is
what
stands
out
from
the
get
go
lacing
is
minimal
but
still
decent
a
very
sweet
smell
from
the
malt
and
you
can
barely
tell
of
hops
involved
the
taste
is
smooth
creamy
and
very
refreshing
grainy
and
earthy
yet
very
crisp
and
the
hop
bitterness
leaves
that
nice
puckering
with
every
sip
this
is
a
great
pilsner
very
cheap
as
well
you
can
get
a
16oz
plus
9
for
1
59
great
deal
for
a
great
beer
perfect
for
a
meal
and
on
those
hot
bbq
days
even
without
the
extra
bite
this
goes
down
well
and
for
the
0
97
that
i
paid
for
it
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
a
very
cear
and
clean
light
yellow
color
with
a
big
white
foamy
head
about
half
the
way
through
the
bottle
i
could
detect
a
light
sweet
biscuit
aroma
but
not
much
else
there
was
a
grassygrainy
flavor
with
a
smooth
bitterness
in
the
finish
i
could
definitely
recomend
this
to
any
of
my
lagerhead
friends
pale
clear
straw
color
with
a
modest
head
nicely
malty
aroma
with
a
bit
of
hops
initial
taste
is
slightly
sweet
followed
by
malt
and
some
grassy
hop
spiciness
thin
fizzy
mouthfeel
clean
smooth
finish
a
pleasant
easy
to
drink
beer
but
there
are
other
pilseners
that
i
like
better
warsteiner
premium
verum
is
decent
beer
but
is
only
a
fraction
better
than
average
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
even
though
it
doesnt
overly
appeal
to
me
i
do
appreciate
its
adding
to
my
growing
but
still
limited
knowledge
of
the
pilsener
style
a
pretty
standard
pils
very
dull
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
foamy
head
the
head
disappeared
quickly
with
no
lace
left
the
smell
was
sweet
and
slightly
skunky
the
taste
was
unnaturally
sweet
up
front
like
rice
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
at
the
end
with
a
good
amount
of
skunkyness
very
thin
body
and
highly
carbonated
not
very
drinkable
to
me
i
will
pass
on
another
one
this
beer
really
does
claim
to
be
the
queen
on
beers
seriously
im
not
kidding
its
printed
right
there
in
german
and
gold
on
the
label
a
somewhat
accurate
billing
i
think
anyway
it
pours
creamy
amber
and
tumbles
heavily
into
a
bold
offwhite
head
and
a
golden
body
smells
sweet
nutty
and
a
little
like
citrus
head
fades
to
whisps
of
lace
after
only
a
minute
or
two
starts
clean
noticably
bitter
and
sporting
a
minute
citrus
taste
this
brew
is
medium
bodied
and
offers
a
very
even
bitter
and
practically
undefinable
taste
as
it
sits
on
the
tongue
once
the
brew
washes
away
its
finish
drags
a
smooth
malty
taste
over
top
of
the
pervasive
hop
bitterness
unfortunately
the
bitter
note
remains
in
teh
aftertaste
after
the
malts
fade
away
the
result
is
a
metallic
aftertaste
that
not
only
lasts
but
is
also
unpleasant
overall
though
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
was
actually
the
first
beer
i
purchased
after
turning
21
so
it
is
a
sentimental
favorite
for
me
it
is
actually
a
decent
session
session
beer
and
i
love
the
minikegs
for
cookouts
with
my
buddies
as
they
can
actually
drink
this
beer
appearance
is
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
foam
head
that
lingers
for
awhile
smell
has
a
faint
note
of
some
hops
but
is
mainly
malt
as
far
as
im
concerned
taste
is
more
of
the
same
this
beer
is
extremely
balanced
and
nothing
really
jumps
out
at
me
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
nothing
special
drinkabilty
is
good
i
can
drink
this
all
night
i
usually
prefer
american
and
british
beers
but
this
one
is
a
bit
better
than
some
of
the
other
germans
ive
tried
although
admittedly
the
germans
ive
had
are
of
the
larger
brewer
variety
so
i
havent
even
come
close
to
exploring
them
i
could
find
this
a
dependable
beer
i
could
get
a
6er
of
from
time
to
time

note
i
gotta
admit
that
their
old
elitist
ad
pitch
about
life
is
too
short
to
drink
cheap
beer
still
sticks
with
me
i
find
it
too
short
to
drink
blah
beer
wont
go
out
of
my
way
for
this
one
of
the
better
european
pilseners
in
my
humble
opinion
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
eventually
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
is
a
light
beer
with
pale
malt
and
skunky
yeast
scent
the
taste
is
above
average
it
has
a
nice
refeshing
taste
but
is
limited
to
basic
pale
malt
flavor
and
a
bitter
dry
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
german
pilsner
but
not
a
favorite
of
this
american
drinker
pale
straw
in
colour
slight
head
with
some
lacing
metallic
grain
aroma
not
much
else
to
it
light
grainy
flavour
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
could
not
discern
any
hops
to
speak
of
watery
mouthfeel
not
much
body
to
it
not
very
pleasant
at
all
to
be
honest
this
was
far
better
from
a
can
which
utterly
boggles
my
mind
perhaps
it
may
be
a
freshness
issue
wow
i
would
have
sworn
this
was
better
but
the
bottle
i
had
while
in
germany
just
wasnt
as
good
as
the
other
beers
i
had
been
enjoying
pour
wasnt
bad
looking
pale
golden
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
unfortunately
the
aroma
was
reminiscent
of
cooked
vegetables
i
found
the
taste
grainy
and
the
finish
was
sweeter
that
i
am
normally
used
to
i
will
try
this
again
if
the
opportunity
arises
but
next
time
i
will
stick
to
smaller
breweries
its
a
shame
as
this
is
considered
a
permium
beer
in
germany
brewed
with
hop
extracts
this
german
lager
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
with
a
large
white
crown
of
foam
that
leaves
occosional
lacing
the
smell
is
slight
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
flavor
is
pleasantly
malty
but
not
chewy
the
hops
dont
jump
out
at
you
but
are
present
enough
to
provide
a
crisp
flavor
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
refreshing
slightly
dry
drinkabiltiy
factor
is
high
i
could
see
polishing
off
several
of
these
drinkable
but
bitburger
is
better
great
carbonation
and
smooth
mouthfeel
makes
this
an
easy
drinking
beer
my
my
just
a
very
crisp
clean
pilsener
from
the
land
of
chocolate
credit
homer
simpson
it
doesnt
want
to
make
me
pack
up
my
bags
and
head
to
germany
to
try
it
on
tap
but
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
around
the
house
as
an
everyday
beer
a
good
beer
to
sit
in
front
of
the
tv
with
and
watch
football
clear
bright
golden
hue
a
decent
clear
white
foamy

that
will
maintain
its

throughout

some

does
not

in

a

final
thoughts
imo
an
excellent
lager
would
like
to
have
on
tap
the
top
selling
german
beer
at
the
liquor
store
i
work
at
easily
better
than
expected
and
i
like
the
packaging
going
to
have
to
get
one
of
our
minikegs
pours
clear
enough
to
take
an
eye
exam
through
there
was
a
nice
wheaty
smell
the
taste
is
really
smooth
but
nothing
fantastic
this
beer
is
easiest
described
as
a
crowd
pleaser
i
cannot
imagine
anyone
that
cant
say
it
isnt
a
decent
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
i
wouldnt
mind
a
cooler
of
this
at
the
beach
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
favor
as
my
regular
this
beer
was
a
nice
crisp
clear
golden
color
it
also
had
a
nice
large
white
fluffy
head
the
smell
was
really
light
with
some
sweetness
to
the
nose
taste
was
also
light
with
made
it
really
easy
to
drink
the
aftertaste
seemed
to
have
a
sweet
almost
honey
taste
to
it
again
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
but
nothing
special
ive
enjoyed
this
brew
many
times
without
being
rocked
by
it
all
up
tho
still
one
of
the
more
tasty
lagers
going
around
in
the
already
flooded
market
of
the
style
highly
drinkable
nothing
that
will
rock
your
beer
drinking
world
but
a
good
next
step
for
those
who
drink
primarily
mass
produced
rice
and
corn
syrup
american
beers
the
thing
saving
this
beer
is
its
amazing
creaminess
very
smooth
and
drinkable
i
must
admit
though
i
dont
remember
the
bottle
version
being
as
smooth
must
be
the
mini
keg
overall
highly
underrated
beer
if
you
are
a
pilsner
drinker
and
crave
some
extra
malt
character
this
is
it
a
great
beer
to
convert
a
misguided
light
beer
drinking
friend
a
dead
clear
incredibly
pale
goldcolored
beer
my
bottle
started
with
a
messy
clump
head
disappearing
to
nothing
fast
it
also
had
big
bubbled
carbonation
sticking
to
the
side
of
the
pint
glass
smelled
of
florals
and
grainy
malt
tasted
of
thin
pale
malt
and
a
sticky
dry
bitter
from
the
clean
florals
of
german
hops
pretty
good
session
pilsener
with
a
bit
more
character
than
an
american
pilsener
smooth
moderate
mouthfeel
and
not
too
filling
not
a
bad
beer
too
i
found
warsteiner
much
more
enjoyable
than
bitburger
but
not
really
a
gem
in
itself
color
is
a
fairly
vivrant
gold
with
a
thick
white
glob
of
a
head
aromas
are
slightly
more
pungent
and
fill
the
nose
with
slightly
herby
and
tangy
aromas
flavor
is
much
milder
but
offers
light
hoppy
notes
and
clean
finish
flavors
are
extremely
non
offensive
and
help
to
achieve
a
slightly
higher
than
average
drinkability
pours
to
a
sudsy
white
head
and
pale
yellow
color
with
ample
carbonation
aroma
is
rather
much
like
heineken
with
out
the
skunkinesssort
of
spicy
as
you
would
expect
from
saaz
hops
it
also
smells
of
cheap
malt
and
corn
adjunct
the
corniness
must
be
just
the
sweetness
developed
from
german
mashing
methods
it
tastes
decently
good
enough
it
has
a
cheap
malt
and
grass
with
a
nice
refreshing
lingering
drynessbitternessspiciness
in
the
finish
it
can
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
nothing
outstanding
i
may
very
well
be
overrating
this
pilsener
but
i
thought
it
was
wellbalanced
and
despite
the
level
of
carbonation
i
would
chose
this
over
a
budcoorsmillerfosterscanadian
any
day
pity
about
the
lacing
and
the
head
though
this
beer
pours
a
clear

color
with
a
large
bubbly
white
head
the
smell
is
a
mild
but
rich
maltiness
with
a
very
very
slight
spicy
underlying
hoppiness
the
mouthfeel
had
a
rather
suprising
roundness
the
flavor
opens
with
a
mild
slight
sweet
malt
with
a
slightly
astringent
hoppiness

beer

not

i
noticed
in
the
beer
i
had
last
night
but
didnt
review
mouthfeel
is
very
thin

just
plain
boring
certainly
a
drinkable
beer
but
if

it

reminds

dont
have

non

just
not
something
i
normally
drink
or
buy
a
decent
pilsener
all
of
the
sudden
i
could
go
for
a
coney
dog
with
a
brown
spicy
mustard
in
particular
a
hoffmann
coney
from
central
ny
area
and
some

gee
i
wonder
why
when
poured
into
my
glass
this
pilsner
poured
with
a
medium
head
that
dissolved
quickly
the
carbonation
could
be
seen
rising
to
the
top
it
had
a
fruity
aroma
to
it
in
my
opinion
the
body
was
yellow
in
hue
it
had
a
bitter
taste
and
an
aftertaste
that
lingered
the
appearance
of
this
fairly
mediocre
pilsner
consisted
of
an
attractive
clear
golden
color
it
had
a
nice
frothy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
the
smell
was
of
weak
malt
with
a
decent
hop
presence
a
crisp
yet
smooth
taste
was
defined
by
the
solid
malt
foundation
and
the
hops
make
a
lightly
bitter
complement
the
mouthfeel
was
a
bit
too
bland
bordering
on
rough
the
smoothness
in
the
taste
was
pretty
much
absent
in
the
feel
and
the
aftertaste
a
decent
beer
all
around
id
choose
warsteiner
over
the
american
macros
in
a
second
still
ive
had
much
better
pilsners
this
pale
yellow
pilsener
tops
a
mild
white
slightly
hopped
head
and
nose
the
aroma
is
of
minor
malty
flavors
struggling
to
please
the
palate
although
and
enjoyable
average
pilsener
and
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
it
finishes
dry
i
like
it
and
echo
others
in
wanting
to
try
it
on
tap
every
time
i
drink
this
i
think
it
must
be
dumbed
down
for
the
american
market
the
appearance
is
decent
with
a
golden
color
topped
by
a
nice
white
head
the
head
recedes
quickly
and
the
aroma
is
just
a
faint
note
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
little
bitter
with
a
slight
edginess
to
it
minimal
malt
tastes
and
no
real
flavors
to
speak
of
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
harsh
but
somewhat
typical
for
an
average
pils
a
slight
lingering
aftertaste
is
distracting
and
tough
to
identify
almost
like
cardboard
drinkability
ok
its
better
than
most
us
macro
lagers
but
there
a
plenty
of
better
beers
out
there
in
this
price
range
it
may
suffer
a
bit
due
to
transportation
seems
to
have
potential
but
never
delivers
the
goods
vey
palelight
yellow
pour
with
a
think
head
mild
nose
a
little
hoppiness
to
it
but
nothing
really
stands
out
smooth
texture
lighty
hopped
crisp
towards
the
end
and
a
dry
bitter
finish
not
something
i
would
make
a
point
of
drinking
again
a
half
decent
beer
but
not
a
classic
a
nice
golden
tone
with
a
thick
but
disappearing
white
head
pours
with
a
rhythmical
and
consistent
carbonation
present
within
and
much
lacing
left
gradually
the
smell
slightly
malty
and
with
a
small
amount
of
hops
and
yeast
is
very
faint
but
does
not
actually
underestimate
its
taste
somewhat
sweet
malty
and
bitter
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
complimented
with
an
omnipresent
metallic
underfeeling
that
gives
it
a
characteristical
pilsen
style
full
bodied
a
fine
thirst
quencher
and
terrific
pilsener
this
sample
was
a
500
ml
bottle
that
poured
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
minimal
white
head
though
when
i
did
try
to
coax
it
along
it
came
up
much
fuller
the
head
was
very
sudsy
and
evaporated
somewhat
quickly
but
did
leave
some
slippery
lacing
the
smell
was
much
like
any
pale
lager
perhaps
a
bit
hoppier
this
does
not
seem
classic
pilsener
style
as
the
hops
do
not
seem
like
saaz
as
would
be
found
in
say
a
pilsner
urquell
the
flavor
is
good
not
great
and
this
is
very
drinkable
fairly
high
carbonation
leaves
a
crisp
feel
in
the
finish
better
than
many
domestics
if
nothing
better
is
around
id
like
to
try
the
tap
version
to
compare
to
this
bottle
i
could
have
easily
written
an
extremely
negative
review
of
this
beer
based
on
some

had

from
the
front
of
the
palate
all
the
way
to
the
back
mostly
corn
perhaps
a
hint
of
citrus
and
grass
but
too
faint
to
be
sure
no
hop
flavor
to
speak
of
not
impressed
with
this
selection
i
was
disappointed
to
say
the
least
after
having
a
strong
recommendation
from
a
friend
i
picked
some
up
color
is
yellow
haylike
with
a
strong
white
head
about
a
finger
high
and
stuck
around
leaving
patchy
lace
smell
is
faint
malt
and
hop
some
what
skunky
but
didnt
seem
to
echo
in
the
taste
at
least
not
all
together
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
much
like
a
light
pilsner
although
it
didnt
have
much
malty
sweetness
there
is
a
hint
of
herblike
hop
dry
bitterness
has
a
medium
light
body
feel
with
a
faint
malt
and
drying
hop
finish
left
a
little
empty
and
had
a
small
metallic
tone
an
ok
beer
but
easily
overlooked
for
a
reason
poured
from
a
brown
16
9
oz
bottle
its
quite
light
in
color
a
pale
yellow
with
a
decent
sized
white
head
that
leaves
traces
around
the
glass
to
the
end
the
smell
is
just
detectable
with
notes
of
grain
and
just
a
bit
of
hoppiness
the
taste
is
not
bad
and
though
its
quite
dry
its
also
slightly
sweet
the
hops
are
just
enough
to
give
it
a
kick
it
has
a
surprisingly
creamy
mouthfeel
and
goes
down
like
water
this
is
a
very
drinkable
session
type
beer
not
any
overwhelming
flavor
but
its
inexpensive
versatile
and
can
be
enjoyed
by
just
about
anyone
all
around
a
decent
lager
beer
this
one
goes
on
sale
often
around
here
a
good
beer
at
a
reasonable
price
is
a
winning
combination
nice
bready
smell
clear
golden
colour
a
good
tasting
pilsner
doesnt
exactly
knock
your
socks
off
but
decent
a
bit
of
a
tart
aftertaste
but
really
a
very
clean
beer
not
super
crisp
but
an
awesome
session
beer
filling
the
cooler
with
these
is
a
pretty
sensible
idea
so
this
beer
poured
into
the
glass
a
light
yellowgold
color
decent
carbonation
was
visible
there
was
little
to
no
head
present
except
for
the
23
seconds
after
pouring
and
what
was
left
was
a
rim
around
the
surface
the
color
of
the
slight
head
and
rim
were
white
and
there
was
no
lace
present
the
aroma
was
crisp
and
had
hints
of
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
also
crisp
slight
malt
and
hops
were
on
the
tongue
but
i
did
notice
a
hint
of
sour
fruit
present
to
be
honest
it
reminded
me
of
bud
but
not
that
bad
it
was
an
experience
but
not
one
i
would
get
again
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
decent
foamy
head
clean
malty
nose
but
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
taste
was
malty
very
clean
and
crisp
medium
bodied
this
is
definitely
a
beer
you
can
drink
a
good
amount
of
id
say
its
a
good
alternative
to
something
like
heineken
a
good
beer
to
have
around
just
to
refresh
oneself
an
excellent
beer
pours
a
pale
blonde
colour
with
a
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
half
nice
aroma
of
hops
tasted
sweet
at
first
with
a
bitter
bite
afterwards
at
first
this
could
be
confused
for
a
cerveza
one
could
down
quite
a
few
of
these
and
be
satisfied
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
produces
a
respectable
lace
warsteiner
verum
has
a
faint
malty
scent
the
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
with
a
bit
of
a
hoppy
finish
im
not
much
of
a
lager
fan
and
this
beer
will
not
change
me
however
if
i
had
to
choose
a
lager
most
likely
warsteiner
would
be
the
choice
taste
is
not
at
all
complex
this
is
a
german
lager
to
have
a
few
of
malty
flavor
and
not
much
else
typical
german
lagers
should
be
clean
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
and
this
one
does
its
job
palest
pale
yellow
color
fine
white
head
aromatic
head
i
e
giving
off
the
typical
lagertype
whiff
fresh
citrusy
lemon
clean
simple
blah
blah
blah
im
sorry
no
matter
how
many
times
i
try
to
come
up
with
something
new
fresh
original
unique
etc
theres
nothing
i
can
do
its
a
boring
beer
pours
medium
straw
decent
white
head
which
leaves
quickly
almost
no
smell
very
smooth
taste
a
little
fruity
tasting
somewhat
grainy
finish
no
distinct
flavor
lacking
in
both
the
malt
and
hop
dept
basically
this
is
a
pretty
boring
brew
nothing
bad
here
but
nothing
special
or
memorable
either
worth
a
try
though
i
like
this
beer
much
better
than
the
dunkel
version
your
basic
german
pilsner
which
pours
a
golden
hue
and
the
white
head
that
dissipates
pretty
quick
i
have
bought
a
five
liter
mini
keg
of
this
before
and
found
it
to
be
a
really
drinkable
beer
superior
to
all
macros
it
is
just
a
nice
beer
with
no
off
flavors
a
nice
sweet
finish
that
is
also
apparent
in
the
aroma
if
i
was
in
germany
wouldnt
touch
this
one
but
hey
in
my
hometown
in
wv
there
isnt
many
options
this
is
a
nice
beer
good
for
football
games
and
any
time
you
plan
on
drinking
a
few
nothing
i
have
to
think
too
hard
about
and
that
is
what
makes
it
enjoyable
to
me
straw
colored
gold
with
a
thick
white
head
that
fades
a
hop
smell
hits
you
kinda
fruitsweet
smell
a
slight
hop
tase
from
start
to
finish
very
easy
to
drink
a
light
tase
more
of
a
beer
for
food
a
good
german
pils
there
are
much
better
out
there
pours
a
clear
and
pale
light
straw
color
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
dissipates
into
a
nice
lace
spotted
with
tiny
bubbles
nose
is
clean
and
fresh
with
notes
of
sweet
malts
the
carbonation
comes
alive
in
the
mouth
with
flavors
of
sweet
grains
and
a
nice
amount
of
bitter
hops
finish
is
crisp
and
dry
this
beer
goes
great
with
some
grilled
bratwurst
quite
good
pils
by
brauerei
warsteiner
warsteiner
premium
is
one
of
them
even
though
appearance
may
not
be
the
best
it
could
be
its
mouthfeel
and
taste
must
be
rewarded
also
the
fact
that
it
is
not
very
strong
makes
it
easier
to
drink
at
any
time
of
the
day
last
word
average
german
beer
appearance
is
very
disappointing
but
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
rewarding
there
is
no
after
taste
with
this
product
poured
to
a
light
yellow
with
a
medium
head
aroma
was
a
crisp
clean
while
the
taste
was
not
very
impressive
an
easy
beer
to
drink
that
has
a
nice
hoppy
finish
certainly
worth
a
try
once
but
not
again
next
to
weihenstephaner
this
is
my
favorite
german
brewery
to
pronounce
ignoring
a
moderately
prickly
backofthethroat
tickle
this
beer
glides
effortlessly
through
the
pipes
a
gluey
lace
a
nose
of
sod
and
powdered
sugar
a
brilliant
blond
clarity
and
most
importantly
a
wellbalanced
flavor
that
survives
on
your
buds
until
the
next
tip
of
the
glass
a
clear
light
gold
color
on
the
pour
the
head
is
mountainous
frothy
long
lasting
and
the
lace
gauzy
nose
is
malt
clean
and
crisp
front
is
malt
the
top
reedy
the
finish
is
amazingly
hopped
for
a
pilsener
modest
carbonation
and
a
very
dry
long
lasting
aftertaste
lagerspils
will
never
be
my
beers
of
choice
but
this
one
is
drinkable
and
a
nice
session
beer
ranks
914
on
my
current
1000
beer
master
list
had
this
on
tap
in
belgium
as
a
quick
nightcap
near
the
hotel
i
was
staying
at
and
i
must
say
it
had
that
sweet
malty
flavor
that
i
enjoy
in
a
lager
and
served
in
the
appropriate
glass
just
made
it
that
much
better
i
gave
it
another
full
point
in
the
taste
catagory
nice
thick
white
foam
on
the
initial
pour
slowly
dissipates
over
time
but
thick
enough
to
leave
residue
on
the
glass
just
a
half
a
shade
darker
than
most
domestic
pilsners
a
very
bright
carbonation
followed
by
a
dry
burnt
hop
flavor
this
gives
way
to
a
bitter
hop
after
taste
the
texture
is
quite
thin
but
in
a
way
makes
the
beer
that
much
smoother
to
drink
not
to
shabby
who
knows
it
might
be
better
warm
medium
gold
color
and
vigorous
fine
streaming
bubbles
upward
to
a
dusting
of
whiteness
smell
of
alcohol
and
overripe
meyer
lemons
somehow
strikes
a
positive
impression
on
me
very
dry
on
the
attack
even
grain
flavors
throughout
and
bitter
hops
arriving
in
the
middle
the
aftertaste
features
a
nice
echo
of
burnt
sugar
bitterness
a
simple
beer
that
is
nevertheless
poised
and
easy
to
like
warsteiner
premium
verum
really
awful
euro
lager
bad
skunked
aroma
bad
skunked
taste
nice
clear
color
though
not
worth
the
money
or
the
time
and
i
find
the
line
on
the
back
that
life
is
too
short
to
drink
bad
beer
to
be
the
height
of
irony
1
pint
can
16
oz
with
a
freshness
date
on
the
bottom
bright
pale
gold
with
a
firm
bright
white
head
good
retention
very
nice
noble
and
somewhat
spicy
hop
aroma
backed
by
malt
and
a
hint
of
crisp
apple
rich
malt
hop
flavor
along
with
a
good
mouthfeel
not
creamy
but
full
it
clearly
displays
pilsner
malt
and
grassy
and
herbal
hops
backed
by
a
solid
bitterness
very
well
balanced
big
hop
finish
with
a
long
lasting
dry
aftertaste
an
excellent
crisp
and
refreshing
north
german
pilsner
of
the
highest
quality
a
prime
candidate
for
getting
macroswillers
out
of
adjunct
land
an
average
pilsner
pretty
drinkable
but
no
real
distinguishing
characteritics
mine
was
slightly
off
in
taste
a
little
skunked
i
would
guess
quite
a
bit
better
than
us
macro
but
look
for
a
micro
to
get
a
better
pils
continental
hop
aroma
is
present
but
the
bottles
i
had
seemed
a
little
light
struck
nice
stable
white
head
subtle
maltiness
is
balanced
finishes
with
a
crisp
bitterness
i
thought
that
the
beer
was
refreshing
but
sort
of
ordinary
light
body
and
somewhat
dry
with
traces
of
malt
in
background
hop
bitterness
also
mild
a
refreshing
and
satisfying
warmweather
german
pils
really
pale
color
and
by
the
time
the
beer
got
to
me
there
wasnt
much
in
the
way
of
a
head
not
sure
if
the
beer
is
naturally
small
headed
quick
dissipating
or
if
they
just
took
too
long
getting
it
to
me
very
pale
and
thin
color
flavor
isnt
so
pale
or
thin
strong
peppery
hops
dominate
the
flavor
with
a
bitter
finish
something
about
it
reminded
me
of
body
odor
or
a
kid
i
knew
in
middle
school
who
had
funky
breath
didnt
really
taste
too
skunky
though
golden
crisp
clean
and
delicious
i
was
surprised
to
find
a
quality
german
lager
priced
evenly
with
mediocre
heineken
it
is
smooth
and
lacks
that
overpowering
carbonation
of
heine
fantastic
right
out
of
the
bottle
and
even
better
refreshingly
smooth
out
of
a
mini
keg
fantastic
this
one
is
right
up
there
with
weihenstephaner
the
color
is
light
and
looks
crisp
with
a
moderate
head
the
aroma
is
consistent
of
a
real
good
german
brew
hints
of
wheat
and
hops
this
is
one
great
german
bier
prost
clear
golden
in
color
with
nice
thick
head
moderate
lace
aroma
is
light
with
slight
grasslike
bouquet
very
crisp
and
clean
semi
sweet
with
crisp
mouthfeel
and
high
level
of
carbonation
somewhat
dry
finishes
with
a
slight
hop
bitterness
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
touch
of
cloudiness
very
nice
off
white
head
good
lace
toasty
biscuit
malt
aromas
along
with
modest
hops
flavor
begins
with
a
light
stinging
carbonation
then
toasty
malts
and
a
slight
sweetness
rises
towards
a
crisp
slightly
dry
hop
finish
with
herbal
and
medicinal
flavors
this
beers
pale
color
is
deceptive
it
looks
rather
watery
but
is
in
fact
quite
substantial
distictive
among
pilsnerstyle
brews
and
very
good
warsteiner
premium
verum
is
truly
a
great
beer
for
the
masses
i
find
myself
coming
back
to
warsteiner
time
after
time
and
enjoying
it
each
and
every
time
pours
with
an
outstanding
beautiful
fluffy
long
lasting
head
super
pale
colored
liquid
i
mean
ive
had
some
light
looking
beers
before
but
this
is
light
nose
is
of
very
light
malt
with
delicate
hops
in
there
too
taste
has
got
the
goods
though
a
clean
malt
mouthfeel
with
medium
bitter
hops
followed
by
again
a
clean
finish
on
the
hoppy
side
like
the
dark
version
this
beer
is
a
pleasure
to
drink
on
a
hot
hot
hot
summer
day
such
as
the
4th
of
july
like
im
doing
please
no
comments
about
drinking
a
european
beer
on
independence
day
o
we
had
this
today
while
playing
golf
it
was
hot
and
the
warsteiner
was
wet
and
cold
very
light
flavor
little
aroma
and
we
played
a
little
better
after
having
one
wouldnt
go
out
of
our
way
to
buy
it
but
if
its
there
a
no
frills
beer
but
something
nice
and
clean
to
switch
to
now
and
then
when
all
you
want
to
do
is
quench
a
monster
beer
thirst
i
have
to
say
i
was
a
little
let
down
the
2
times
i
tried
this
beer
after
hearing
so
many
good
things
about
it
it
tastes
a
lot
like
the
standard
fare
that
is
clean
but
not
really
that
flavorful
straw
colored
w
a
decent
head
its
crystal
clear
like
a
good
pils
should
be
very
grainy
in
aroma
and
a
touch
of
lightly
skunked
hops
is
there
as
well
typical
import
pilsner
nose
despite
the
brown
bottle
its
very
dry
and
highly
carbonated
and
the
mouthfeel
is
thus
quite
prickly
but
is
okay
for
a
pils
this
brew
is
very
dry
all
around
malt
sweetness
is
minimal
and
hop
bitterness
dominates
although
its
lacking
in
flavor
this
would
make
a
great
lawnmower
brew
if
it
werent
over
priced
theres
nothing
memorable
about
this
pilsner
however
decently
drinkable
german
lager
fresh
clean
but
quite
bland
in
its
flavour
good
for
a
hot
day
when
its
too
hot
to
drink
beer
with
flavour
this
would
make
a
great
summer
time
beer
complex
and
hoppy
upfront
taste
very
smooth
middle
and
finish
lightly
medium
bodied
clean
finish
no
skunk
not
my
gig
but
i
think
its
what
it
needs
to
be
smooth
slightly
sweet
clean
and
crisp
with
a
good
hop
character
a
good
choice
on
those
hot
summer
days
better
than
the
american
standards
which
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
but
at
twice
the
price
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
when
served
ice
cold
nothing
too
special
here
otherwise
a
decent
inexpensive
beer
average
sums
this
beer
up
pretty
well
i
agree
with
jason
very
average
beer
nothing
offensive
at
all
about
it
and
they
go
down
nicely
but
still
average
i
think
becks
and
st
pauli
girl
have
more
character
though
there
is
really
not
much
to
write
about
here
it
is
brightly
coloured
and
has
a
finger
of
fizzy
head
that
does
not
hang
around
for
long
there
is
a
bit
of
a
floral
aroma
and
some
sweet
bread
in
the
flavour
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
tell
this
apart
from
most
macro
lagers
if
its
better
for
our
world
because
it
is
organic
groovy
as
a
beer
its
really
not
my
thing
nice
touch
with
the
organic
lager
marketing
but
that
in
itself
will
not
turn
an
average
beer
into
a
good
one
this
beer
tasted
so
close
to
a
a
traditional
belgian
beer
i
couldnt
tell
the
difference
the
beer
looks
ok
and
smells
light
but
the
flavor
is
top
notch
i
just
wish
they
would
remove
the
word
organic
from
the
label
adds
nothing
to
the
desire
to
drink
it
overall
easy
drinking
beer
a
bit
too
sweet
and
light
for
my
taste
but
a
decent
choice
to
introduce
a
commercial
beer
drinker
to
craft
beer
pours
a
fairly
clear
straw
color
with
a
huge
frothy
bubbly
white
head
that
persists
bready
earthy
light
fruity
aroma
with
a
hint
of
floral
hop
bready
sweet
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
fruit
and
spice
medium
to
light
body
with
a
moderate
level
of
carbonation
decent
lager
with
a
nice
breadiness
overall
and
ok
pils
but
most
organic
brews
for
me
really
seem
to
be
missing
something
to
complete
a
full
enjoyable
beer
experience
good
but
nothing
extraordinary
extremely
crisp
clean
and
clear
high
carbonation
wispy
yet
creamy
head
medium
sweetness
mildly
hoppy
had
on
tap
at
a
small
pubeatery
in
calgary
blind
monk
beer
arrived
in
a
pint
glass
a
pale
lemon
drop
yellow
with
one
finger
or
so
of
white
head
aroma
very
subdued
but
maybe
my
sense
of
smell
isnt
so
great
i
do
get
a
little
sweet
bread
pilsner
malt
and
a
few
floral
noble
hop
notes
not
much
of
an
odor
however
fortunately
the
taste
is
more
interesting
oddly
enough
i
get
some
fruit
notes
banana
pineapple
a
bit
of
vanilla
creme
perfume
and
a
green
malt
juiciness
the
whole
package
is
quite
sweet
but
wellcarbonated
hops
could
be
more
pronounced
but
i
do
get
the
sweet
hay
flavor
and
watermelon
rindlike
green
bitterness
that
i
also
taste
in
sam
adams
boston
lager
and
other
lagers
that
feature
hallertau
hops
apparently
grown
in
new
zealand
rather
than
germany
where
organic
versions
are
currently
unavailable
could
this
account
for
the
different
fruit
notes
described
earlier
finish
pretty
clean
and
crisp
although
there
are
clearly
some
residual
sugars
its
not
an
earthshatteringly
great
pilsner
but
i
will
say
that
this
brew
is
better
on
tap
bottles
i
have
had
were
more
flat
bland
and
devoid
of
the
interesting
flavors
i
could
detect
here
edit
had
this
again
august
1
2014
and
noticed
that
it
did
match
up
with
the
previous
ratings
and
flavours
with
one
exception
the
beer
i
enjoyed
had
a
much
stronger
cracker
and
biscuit
like
flavor
to
it
than
i
recall
not
sure
why
the
discrepancy
but
it
was
enough
to
be
noticed
still
a
decent
ontario
pilsner
tastes
as
light
as
it
is
at
4
2
tastes
allmalt
what
little
malt
is
there
and
with
very
little
hops
overall
the
small
amount
of
hops
dominates
the
small
amount
of
malt
one
of
the
few
beers
i
drink
cold
overall
not
a
very
impressive
beer
id
rather
have
mill
streets
stock
ale
over
this
any
day
of
the
week
overall
25
side
note
a
pils
plain
enough
to
be
mistaken
for
an
american
adjunct
not
that
its
necessarily
bad
its
just
that
it
isnt
really
anything
beer
flavoured
beer
the
fact
that
its
organic
doesnt
matter
to
me
what
i
do
like
is
its
a
fairly
widely
available
beer
that
most
people
who
arent
craft
beer
drinkers
can
still
agree
on
great
for
sharing
a
pitcher
with
friends
far
from
amazing
a
halfdecent
lager
that
i
would
reach
for
before
others
at
a
party
or
the
dock
simply
because
it
doesnt
taste
like
water
still
a
lot
to
wish
for
tho
middle
of
the
road
but
nice
for
summer
session
beer
final
thoughts
this
beer
is
as
advertised
a
microbrewed
lager
they
seem
to
have
followed
common
sense
and
left
out
any
adjuncts
there
are
some
real
nice
flavors
in
this
one
that
stay
true
to
the
style
while
it
isnt
more
that
just
a
slightly
above
average
beer
its
still
a
far
cry
from
the
macrolagers
that
elude
all
conventional
wisdom
and
fly
off
the
shelves
overall
a
simple
euro
pale
lager
by
mill
street
the
flavours
are
not
complex
nor
should
they
be
this
brew
is
kept
clean
and
simple
making
it
a
refreshing
summer
session
brew
o
refreshing
and
satisfying
everything
you
need
in
a
light
lager
o
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
and
a
a
decent
tasting
beer
at
4
2
mouthfeel
is
medium
light
and
smooth
not
bad
at
all
clean
taste
and
well
balanced
too
bad
about
the
clear
bottle
i
enjoy
other
mill
st
beers
but
this
one
is
sub
par
it
could
be
a
great
beer
but
needs
more
attention
in
the
brewhaus
o
another
brew
from
mill
street
that
is
below
par
of
what
they
should
be
selling
wouldnt
have
it
again
this
beer
is
fine
overall
nothing
i
find
particularly
interesting
or
flavourful
throw
it
in
the
good
craft
alternative
at
crappy
aalhappy
bars
an
okay
but
ultimately
dull
lager
the
flavours
arent
crisp
enough
and
the
slightly
sweet
malt
kills
everything
overall
it
was
better
than
i
was
expecting
not
spectacular
but
certainly
enjoyable
overall
definitely
better
than
the
countless
macro
lagers
on
the
market
i
could
easily
drink
a
lot
of
this
stuff
on
a
camping
trip
or
any
activity
outdoors
this
beer
is
pretty
much
a
standard
yellow
lager
there
is
very
little
aroma
and
what
there
is
is
vaguely
bready
and
sweet
with
zero
hops
presence
the
taste
is
sweet
and
bready
with
very
little
bitterness
and
thats
about
all
it
may
be
microbrewed
and
organic
but
flavourwise
it
tastes
like
a
massproduced
factory
beer
there
is
nothing
bad
about
it
its
just
not
that
good
and
it
certainly
isnt
worth
paying
any
extra
money
for
o
this
sat
in
my
fridge
for
a
few
weeks
after
i
received
it
from
my
wife
in
a
mixer
pack
it
is
not
my
style
and
i
had
no
real
interest
in
trying
it
so
i
was
surpised
when
i
found
it
drinkable
although
i
would
never
pass
up
an
average
ale
instead
of
it
drinkability
its
a
very
smooth
drinkable
beer
accompanied
with
good
flavours
and
aromas
its
great
for
a
warm
summer
day
this
is
either
a
different
recipe
or
benefits
from
not
being
packaged
in
clear
bottles
but
in
my
opinion
this
is
a
much
more
drinkable
aromatic
flavourful
smooth
experience
with
the
can
good
thing
a
12
cost
me
31
d
although
i
didnt
expect
to
enjoy
this
all
that
much
and
didnt
i
must
say
kudos
to
mill
street
for
brewing
this
beer
organically
just
not
really
my
thing
overall
not
bad
but
nothing
particularly
appealing
here
except
for
the
fact
that
its
organic
final
grade
3
16
a
c
this
beer
is
nothing
special
overall
except
the
gimmick
of
being
organic
it
is
refreshing
though
only
try
if
your
into
light
beers
definately
the
least
interesting
of
the
mill
street
lineup
but
not
terrible
for
the
style
this
was
my
first
mill
street
brew
back
when
i
would
scam
these
baby
bottle
beers
off
my
pops
d
very
one
dimensional
easy
drinking
but
only
because
its
thin
and
generic
one
of
their
poorer
offerings
i
suspect
they
are
simply
capitalizing
on
the
whole
organic
buzz
which
people
dont
even
understand
the
drinkability
is
good
a
bit
more
refreshing
than
most
average
lagers
pilseners
im
not
sure
that
thirst
quenching
should
be
a
priority
in
a
beer
i
prefer
to
savour
fine
flavors
and
aromas
but
this
beer
does
hit
the
spot
d
good
drinkable
d
it
is
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
i
have
had
if
you
rate
this
beer
to
style
it
has
to
get
a
decent
review
not
something
i
would
seek
out
but
this
would
be
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
pours
a
clear
strawyellow
colour
that
started
with
big
white
head
after
a
vigorous
pour
head
dissipates
after
a
minute
or
so
leaving
a
hint
of
spotty
lacing
smells
very
clean
of
grain
and
faint
grassy
hops
flavour
has
a
hint
of
bitterness
but
very
clean
carbonation
level
is
pretty
nice
for
the
style
i
only
buy
this
beer
at
bars
without
better
selection
though
typically
pubs
in
toronto
that
have
this
also
have
tankhouse
as
well
or
as
part
of
the
mill
street
seasonal
packs
when
i
want
the
other
beers
i
usually
just
leave
this
and
the
stock
for
guests
that
come
over
though
quite
clearly
made
for
organic
people
that
are
bmc
lovers
not
craft
drinkers
looking
for
craft
organic
drink
a
beaus
341ml
bottle
from
the
seasonal
sampler
mix
pack
pours
a
bright
golden
yellow
with
one
finger
of
foamy
white
head
and
drapes
of
lacing
on
the
lager
glass
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
body
smell
and
taste
are
creamed
corn
cooked
veggies
metal
light
floral
grains
of
some
sort
water
flavourless
malts
empty
hop
spiciness
a
bit
salty
mouthfeel
is
creamy
medium
almost
slick
crisp
bite
midpalate
fleeting
dryness
no
aftertaste
inoffensive
but
characterless
and
sadly
i
think
thats
what
the
brewer
was
aiming
for
an
accessible
beer
for
the
masses
this
lacks
soul
flavour
and
good
traits
in
general
not
a
terrible
lager
just
way
too
uninteresting
i
wont
purchase
again
has
a
thin
body
is
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
d
nothing
mind
blowing
but
still
quite
delicious
very
tasty
and
would
be
very
tasty
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
d
drinks
quite
easily
mill
street
organic
lager
pours
a
clear
light
gold
with
not
much
of
a
head
the
aroma
is
slightly
sweet
and
grainy
with
maybe
just
a
touch
of
sulfur
it
was
purchased
in
an
enclosed
six
pack
and
transferred
straight
to
the
fridge
but
still
just
a
hint
of
skunk
not
much
going
on
in
the
flavor
some
graininess
and
just
a
touch
of
light
malty
sweetness
no
hop
flavor
is
noticeable
but
there
is
a
twang
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
the
beer
is
fairly
full
bodied
considering
the
flavor
organic
beers
dont
have
to
be
bland
and
boring
but
this
one
certainly
is
d
easy
enough
to
drink
but
it
is
not
a
beer
that
i
would
buy
again
great
beer
drinkability
is
actually
pretty
good
this
is
the
first
time
ive
tried
this
one
and
ill
admit
to
not
being
a
lagerhead
or
having
high
expectations
of
it
but
ive
been
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
while
i
dont
know
that
id
go
looking
for
it
since
its
not
one
of
my
favourite
styles
its
a
pretty
good
example
of
that
style
and
one
i
wouldnt
turn
my
nose
up
at
served
cold
on
a
warm
day
itd
be
pretty
nice
overall
bland
and
uninteresting
it
only
really
has
one
note
and
absolotely
no
hops
not
bad
as
an
alternative
to
american
lagers
but
nothing
i
would
actively
seek
out
not
bad
this
is
quite
drinkable
i
actually
bought
a
six
of
this
to
use
in
making
pizza
dough
but
would
potentially
buy
it
in
the
summer
to
drink
icecold
on
a
scorching
day
its
that
kind
of
beer
for
sure
mouthfeel
is
fine
and
although
i
dont
love
it
it
would
still
be
easy
to
drink
a
few
if
i
was
thirsty
drinkability
this
is
fairly
expensive
but
this
is
also
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
i
could
easily
pack
away
quite
a
few
of
these
the
clear
bottle
gives
it
a
corona
look
but
this
beer
has
a
much
fuller
mouthfeel
and
great
hop
profile
very
pale
in
colour
this
is
decent
clean
lager
that
has
the
all
malt
taste
and
not
over
sweetness
that
i
look
for
in
a
craft
lager
not
a
pils
but
more
modeled
on
a
north
american
lager
came
as
part
of
mixed
six
pack
but
i
would
consider
buying
this
again
next
summer
hippies
will
feel
good
about
themselves
drinking
this
organic
lager
you
however
may
regret
spending
the
extra
money
too
drink
average
beer
a
fairly
refreshing
quaff
but
not
really
anything
remotely
near
a
german
pils
that
bit
of
pedantry
aside
it
went
well
enough
with
some
decent
chain
restaurant
pulled
pork
also
no
booze
essence
swirling
about
me
when
i
head
back
to
the
clients
offices
light
bodied
and
gassy
its
a
thirst
quencher
on
a
hot
day
but
that
carbonation
is
a
bit
much
this
was
actually
a
surprisingly
decent
beer
came
in
a
clear
bottle
which
had
me
worried
poured
pale
yellow
with
a
thin
foam
the
foam
stayed
however
bit
of
a
light
caramel
and
malt
smell
with
some
light
honey
and
i
think
apricot
scent
some
sort
of
fruit
that
i
could
not
quite
figure
out
tasted
good
nice
blend
of
honey
caramel
various
fruits
both
sweet
and
sour
and
finished
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
a
tad
thin
overall
a
good
session
or
lawn
mower
beer
really
clean
taste
and
honestly
not
bad
for
a
lager
it
has
to
be
up
there
with
creemores
for
one
of
the
better
ontario
lagers
grains
a
bigger
grain
profile
than
the
average
again
that
slightly
off
fruit
note
that
lager
aftertaste
slightly
too
much
carbonation
for
my
liking
belching
like
a
sailor
pretty
standard
craft
pale
lager
not
much
to
really
like
but
drinkable
in
a
pinch
on
a
warm
summer
day
especially
if
faced
with
this
or
a
macro
ive
long
held
the
theory
that
organic
beers
are
brewed
more
to
cash
in
on
the
organic
trend
by
brewing
a
middleoftheroad
watered
down
macroesque
beer
that
wont
put
people
who
arent
used
to
good
beer
off
than
they
are
about
brewing
a
world
class
beer
using
organic
ingredients
and
i
think
this
is
a
textbook
example
of
this
other
than
this
being
a
style
i
dont
usually
drink
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
this
beer
it
isnt
particularly
exciting
but
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
any
flaws
pale
yellow
pour
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
quickly
dssipates
to
a
film
clean
grain
sweet
malt
and
mineral
aroma
flavour
is
pure
pale
malts
with
a
touch
of
lemon
and
mineral
not
exciting
but
very
clean
and
wellexecuted
body
is
refreshing
and
light
and
thankfully
not
as
aggressively
carbonated
as
the
style
can
be
like
i
said
its
not
a
world
beater
but
it
is
more
flawless
than
most
american
pale
lagers
final
thoughts
all
in
all
this
is
a
pretty
solid
lager
but
really
this
is
a
patio
or
hot
day
of
work
beer
the
fact
this
beer
is
organic
is
also
a
slight
bonus
and
it
probably
what
gives
this
beer
its
mild
characteristics
a
pleasant
experience
and
a
beer
that
you
should
try
instead
of
picking
up
your
favorite
macro
lager
pouring
into
a
glass
resulted
in
clear
yellow
ale
with
a
very
fizzy
head
that
quickly
evaporated
smell
was
kinda
sour
not
particularly
in
a
good
way
the
taste
is
fairly
average
some
sweetness
that
quickly
disappears
and
some
slight
bitter
sourness
as
the
end
that
also
quickly
disappears
overall
it
is
a
fairly
smooth
and
light
though
mostly
unremarkable
ale
smooth
mouthfeel
a
good
drinking
beer
to
get
drunk
with
and
you
can
be
healthy
at
the
same
time
if
really
committed
the
next
step
for
mill
street
would
be
to
invest
in
a
local
farm
and
have
them
dedicate
part
of
the
land
to
hop
production
offer
special
local
releases
made
from
and
made
for
the
community
alas
until
then
as
someone
who
tries
to
be
conscientious
about
what
i
put
in
my
body
and
who
also
values
the
importance
of
supporting
local
industry
and
artisans
ill
be
happy
to
have
their
organic
lager
brewed
just
down
the
road
its
not
bad
but
i
found
it
quite
expensive
just
based
on
that
alone
i
wouldnt
really
go
out
of
my
way
for
it
but
it
is
worth
a
try
at
least
once
a
shoottheshit
beer
for
sure
i
tried
this
beer
on
april
30
2008
after
purchasing
an
assorted
6
pack
of
ontario
craft
brews
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
gold
colour
with
a
generous
white
head
which
settled
down
immediately
tons
of
effervescence
the
smell
was
very
very
sour
almost
a
turn
off
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
bodied
lots
of
carbonation
the
flavour
was
a
ton
of
grain
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
not
a
beer
i
would
try
again
overall
mill
st
has
some
awsome
brews
but
sadly
this
is
not
one
of
them
its
hard
to
believe
that
the
brewery
survived
considering
this
was
their
first
offering
i
wish
i
could
say
that
this
is
a
step
up
from
your
typical
macro
but
thats
not
the
case
i
will
try
the
tap
version
to
make
a
final
review
of
the
beer
and
why
the
mini
bottles
why
do
brewers
do
this
d
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
lager
that
i
could
easily
have
many
of
in
a
sitting
and
the
4
2
is
a
nice
change
too
from
the
standard
5
very
drinkable
and
thirstquenching
time
and
a
place
for
everything
it
wont
knock
your
socks
off
but
it
isnt
terrible
taste
is
pretty
awful
sweet
a
little
too
much
in
my
opinion
but
it
does
at
least
lend
flavour
to
a
pretty
weak
beer
a
little
bit
of
grass
and
graininess
unfortunately
the
skunkiness
transmits
to
the
beer
as
well
this
is
way
past
its
prime
its
too
bad
thin
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
about
right
mediumdry
finish
if
this
was
fresh
it
might
not
be
brutal
but
as
it
is
its
nearly
a
drain
pour
too
bad
mill
street
very
pale
yellow
see
through
one
finger
white
head
with
steady
carbonation
smells
of
wet
grass
an
aired
out
spring
basement
taste
is
light
grain
wheat
pomegranite
i
find
not
a
lot
of
hops
a
very
light
thin
mouthfeel
but
a
smooth
texture
just
the
same
the
finish
is
semibitter
dry
crisp
clean
the
overlysmall
222
ml
bottle
is
very
annoying
well
worth
a
try
straightforward
and
easy
drinking
lager
final
statement
an
organic
slightly
crafted
version
of
corona
i
suppose
suitable
for
hot
days
such
as
it
was
today
nothing
to
seek
out
but
probably
better
on
tap
what
can
i
say
this
would
make
a
decent
high
end
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
or
something
light
to
throw
back
on
a
deck
or
patio
on
a
hot
day
even
to
quench
while
barbecuing
if
you
dont
want
to
spoil
your
palate
and
appetite
filling
up
on
beer
before
dinner
probably
one
of
the
smoothest
organic
lagers
ive
ever
sampled
thats
for
sure
definitely
a
great
stepping
stone
lager
to
ween
people
off
of
macros
especially
the
lite
beer
crowd
d
highly
drinkable
another
drinkable
beer
for
the
summer
i
will
settle
for
their
coffee
porter
instead
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
filling
at
all
not
much
of
a
kick
its
a
pretty
straightforward
lighter
beer
and
isnt
too
bad
for
an
organic
allmalt
lager
but
if
im
going
to
go
with
something
lighter
there
are
several
other
beers
that
i
would
choose
first
poured
from
a
clear
222
ml
bottle
a
pale
straw
colour
with
a
onefinger
white
head
sitting
on
top
of
an
effervescent
body
the
head
had
good
staying
power
and
left
sticky
lace
on
my
glass
the
smell
was
bready
malt
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
grass
and
grain
husks
overall
the
taste
was
unremarkable

malty
up
front
with
a
only
a
faint
bitter
bite
from
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
rough
grainy
finish
that
gave
it
some
character
the
small
bottles
and
low
abv
make
it
a
nice
alternative
to
a
gawdawful
light
macro
but
there
are
so
many
other
beers
id
rather
have
was
given
a
bottle
of
this
my
a
friend
who
im
sure
has
a
ba
account
but
i
dont
know
her
screenname
she
is
my
mill
st
supplier
and
this
one
was
new
to
me
tiny
little
bottle
made
me
feel
like
a
giant
poured
like
watery
straw
juice
smelled
like
corn
drippings
and
old
beer
tastes
like
the
high
life
canada
style
thin
corny
vaguely
sour
thin
and
watery
not
a
winner
mill
st
maybe
thats
why
its
in
such
a
small
bottle
no
one
wants
to
drink
a
full
12oz
good
karma
for
being
organic
i
suppose
but
who
knows
what
that
even
means
anymore
stick
with
the
coffee
porter
i
just
had
another
and
its
quite
a
delicious
treat
light
gold
in
colour
with
strong
carbonation
aromas
are
of
light
bread
and
some
surprisingly
sweet
honey
and
nuts
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
spicy
hop
note
hiding
in
there
too
malt
forward
flavor
with
more
of
the
sweetish
malt
character
thankfully
it
dries
out
fairly
quickly
with
some
nice
prickly
bitterness
and
a
bit
more
of
those
spicy
hops
if
they
could
thin
out
the
malt
character
a
bit
this
would
be
much
better
as
it
stands
its
average
at
best
a
fair
offering
but
i
prefered
the
organic
pils
pours
out
to
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
smaller
head
of
white
foam
medium
carbonation
aromas
of
malt
and
grass
mix
with
soured
hops
taste
is
medium
light
bodied
and
a
dry
malt
flavor
dominates
with
hints
of
grassy
hay
and
grain
not
bad
but
nothing
special
mouthfeel
was
nominal
and
on
par
for
the
style
drinkability
borders
on
average
a
fairly
unmemorable
brew
ive
had
better
from
mill
st
pours
a
clear
golden
small
off
white
head
that
goes
really
fast
no
lacing
smell
is
sweet
some
honey
grains
citrus
skunk
taste
is
sweet
and
honeyish
up
front
citrus
in
middle
but
almost
no
flavour
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
medium
carbonation
good
thing
this
comes
in
a
small
bottle
because
i
would
not
want
to
drink
a
full
12
oz
bottle
courtesy
of
lubière
215ml
bottle
poured
a
golden
color
lager
with
a
medium
bubbly
head
with
average
retention
aroma
of
semisweet
malt
with
very
subtle
hops
taste
is
refreshing
with
some
hops
presence
and
a
good
malt
presence
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
clear
bottle
but
not
a
trace
of
skunkyness
in
this
bottle
im
must
say
that
this
is
not
something
that
i
would
be
particularly
interested
in
trying
again
but
i
had
much
worse
beer
in
my
life
the
beer
is
almost
spritzy
with
pretty
lively
carbonation
though
you
wouldnt
know
to
look
at
it
pleasantly
crisp
with
good
hops
and
a
noticeable
graininess
fairly
light
in
body
but
still
suibstantial
enough
to
come
across
as
a
decent
beer
good
for
cleansing
the
palate
oh
and
the
guy
working
at
the
brewery
bar
told
me
that
the
original
organic
lager
is
actually
their
pilsner
with
a
different
label
on
it
dont
know
if
this
is
true
or
not
but
kinda
weird
if
so
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
and
surprisingly
flavorful
light
beer
its
more
like
creemore
springs
than
blue
light
decent
the
200
ml
bottles
are
cute
bit
a
bit
too
small
for
a
4
percent
beer
good
attack
to
announce
its
presence
grain
in
finish
mouthfeel
good
due
to
lasting
nonwatery
finish
of
grain
malt
and
touch
of
hop
mouthfeel
also
a
touch
rounder
than
average
light
colored
lager
reaches
right
into
the
sinuses
for
a
fullhead
experience
just
doesnt
have
a
whole
lot
of
character
i
guess
maybe
thats
due
to
the
style
but
the
malt
is
just
so
one
note
that
its
not
enough
to
recommend
it
for
anyone
looking
for
a
sensory
experiece
instead
of
a
beer
drinking
experience
this
beer
is
designed
for
day
hikes
a
modest
container
an
ability
to
maintain
good
flavorimprove
evenas
it
warms
refreshing
and
intricate
pack
a
dozen
in
the
rucksack
and
crack
em
for
contemplation
at
the
top
of
sugarloaf
an
ok
beer
pale
with
aboveaverage
carbonation
more
promotion
of
organic
term
and
the
195

quality
beer
hint
of
honey
and
lemon
midsip
but
like
a
light
taste
beer
low
carb
too
aroma
is
a
negative
could
be
apple
cider
thin
mouthfeel
could
get
a
lady
to
try
a
beer
as
pale
as
yellow
can
be
without

or
some

hops
dried

perhaps
sort
of
a

mix
very
crisp
very
balanced
very
easy
refreshing
really
the
single
best
beer
in
this
style
to
act
as
a
postlawnmowing
beer
the
retroleaning
logo
sleek
bottle
and
massappeal
of
this
beer
suggest
that
it
is
everything
that
steam
whistle
tries
to
be
except
for
organic
i
guess
only
downside
is
the
small
bottle
which
requires
you
to
plow
through
two
bottles
to
get
your
usual
one
in
the
mouth
its
steely
and
dry
with
shy
fizzics
it
doesnt
need
a
lot
of
gas
to
structure
the
malt
though
as
this
beer
is
almost
completely
attenuated
breezy
curls
of
hay
lemon
peel
and
bitter
rocks
twist
on
the
lengthy
finish
this
is
an
impeccably
balanced
light
beer
outrageously
refreshing
drinkablilty
i
would
probably
buy
this
beer
again
while
i
didnt
fall
in
love
with
it
it
was
different
enough
to
make
me
crave
another
sample
damn
balanced
and
easy
drinking
pilsner
nice
surprise
started
out
as
yet
another
pilsener
but
a
hint
of
spiciness
showed
up
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hops
for
clean
refreshing
finish
this
could
easily
be
a
good
back
yard
beer
this
summer
this
is
a
great
pilsener
its
not
flashy
but
its
well
executed
well
done
recommended
o
very
impressed
i
like
to
buy
from
micros
for
quality
so
went
back
to
store
and
bought
another
12
pak
if
you
are
into
german
pilsners
you
will
likey
050714
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
pretty
dry
good
body
a
friendly
abv
makes
this
a
bona
fide
candidate
for
a
session
or
two
keep
it
cold
o
impressive
this
is
what
ive
been
enjoying
finding
in
the
pilsner
style
straight
simple
and
refreshing
quite
distinctive
beer
but
not
much
to
overcomplicate
or
muck
up
the
taste
refreshing
as
hell
but
way
too
good
for
the
lawnmower
btw
i
like
this
much
more
than
victory
prima
which
i
had
high
hopes
for
but
was
a
bit
disappointed
in
too
bad
i
love
this
so
much
cause
its
damned
expensive
at
126
o
the
finesse
of
this
beer
surprised
me
blindfold
me
and
id
swear
it
came
from
germany
they
even
spelled
pilsner
ze
german
way
on
the
bottle
i
dont
even
remotely
care
that
it
doesnt
bring
the
hop
assault
something
like
prima
pils
does
either
ill
have
to
return
to
this
one
asap
its
that
good
to
grains
biscuits
wellattenuated
maltiness
but
high
bitterness
good
hop
flavor
that
can
be
a
little
harsh
with
its
straightforwardnessarrowroot
herbal
character
one
of
the
more
accurate
american
recreations
of
the
style
good
lingering
bitterness
tart
lemon
aftertaste
no
doubt
a
pils
for
those
who
appreciate
noble
hops
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
but
the
sour
character
is
out
of
place
bitterness
is
certainly
dominant
golden
yellow
in
color
with
perfect
clarity
poured
with
billowy
bright
froth
that
maintained
throughout
as
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
continuously
migrated
upward
fresh
biscuity
malt
and
earthy
floral
hop
aromas
incredibly
soft
delicate
feel
throughout
with
a
light
tanginess
through
the
middle
biscuity
malt
flavor
up
front
followed
by
tangy
but
gentle
spicy
hops
spicy
flavors
transition
to
herbal
hop
flavors
toward
the
end
finished
clean
and
crisp
with
a
light
biscuit
malt
aftertaste
and
herbal
bitterness
on
the
edges
super
easy
drinking
if
not
the
best
one
of
the
best
pilseners
ive
ever
had
oif
you
want
a
pilsner
that
has
a
decent
flavor
i
would
highly
suggest
this
one
o
great
representation
of
the
style
can
imagine
my
grandfather
drinking
beer
like
this
back
in
his
homeland
germany
goes
down
easy
it
is
not
a
bad
drink
but
it
is
not
what
it
claims
to
be
it
tastes
more
like
a
pale
ale
than
a
pilsener
it
is
not
a
german
pilsener
but
more
like
a
sierra
nevada
pale
i
like
stoudts
products
but
i
do
not
like
it
when
companies
get
so
creative
that
they
lose
the
intrinsic
flavour
of
the
type
of
beer
they
are
wanting
to
produce
remarks
well
balanced
and
smooth
pils
isnt
my
favorite
style
but
this
was
pretty
tasty
hops
were
kept
in
check
to
my
tastes
pretty
well
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
an
effervescent
level
of
carbonation
that
is
lively
quite
crisp
snappy
clean
and
refreshing
this
is
balanced
quite
well
and
a
pils
i
could
throw
back
repeatedly
with
no
issue
again
if
the
sulfur
was
not
such
a
leading
role
in
this
i
would
score
it
much
higher
but
im
leaving
it
as
is
a
certainly
different
pilsner
from
victory
and
worth
sitting
down
for
at
least
once
overall
beer
looks
nicer
than
it
tastes
too
little
of
hops
no
complex
aromas
or
flavors
here
a
very
well
made
beer
thats
true
to
style
i
was
disappointed
i
thought
it
was
hoppy
enough
with
noble
hops
but
the
mouthfeel
was
not
nearly
up
to
par
with
even
an
oettinger
it
was
weak
and
thin
the
pils
malts
also
lacked
something
i
didnt
take
notes
so
this
is
the
morning
after
basically
a
weak
imitation
of
a
german
pils
very
original
flavor
amplified
a
mineral
herbal
sensation
you
usually
get
from
czech
pils
plus
adding
some
sweet
oranges
citrusy
props
to
stoudts
for
producing
a
pilsner
that
is
spot
on
it
does
not
do
anything
spectacular
is
just
does
everything
spot
on
props
atmosphere
is
great
great
body
and
head
a
lot
of
lacing
nose
is
really
strong
bread
and
savory
spice
and
a
little
floral
buttery
sweet
sourdough
bread
overall
this
is
a
really
good
quaff
overall
i
am
going
to
say
that
this
is
my
new
favorite
pilsner
its
really
good
and
i
highly
recommend
it
to
anyone
5
out
of
5
world
class
other
notable
pilsners
from
pa
victory
prima
pils
slyfox
pikeland
pils
and
troegs
sunshine
pils
all
of
which
are
in
the
top
50
pilsners
on
ba
a
difficult
style
to
get
right
and
one
that
people
often
overlook
or
think
about
as
generic
probably
has
something
to
do
with
all
the
macro
garbage
out
there
trying
to
pass
themselves
as
german
style
pilsnerslagers
when
you
need
a
crisp
and
refreshing
brew
this
summer
reach
for
a
pennsylvaniamade
pilsner
o
i
enjoy
that
this
pils
doesnt
have
an
overwhelming
amount
of
the
generic
dull
and
very
bitter
hop
character
that
most
do
this
will
be
refreshing
in
the
summer
not
much
of
an
aroma
but
its
refreshing
though
hoppy
and
comes
with
an
initial
rush
of
bitterness
it
is
less
watery
and
more
packed
in
flavor
compared
to
the
czech
pilsners
im
used
to
quite
drinkable
and
you
just
keep
wanting
another
sip
great
stuff
d
a
true
session
beer
clocking
in
at
just
under
5
i
would
gladly
drink
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
but
it
leaves
something
to
be
desired
while
i
drink
this
in
the
dead
of
winter
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
at
some
point
a
great
session
brew
by
stoudts
nothing
more
nothing
less
overall
i
personally
love
the
dynamic
qualities
of
the
flavor
and
the
creamy
satisfying
aroma
for
me
this
is
a
topnotch
pils
with
great
drinkability
i
will
definitely
have
this
again
mediumlight
bodied
crisp
and
lively
carbonation
a
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
beer
great
for
putting
away
by
the
pint
the
taste
is
just
perfectly
balanced
and
understated
right
now
i
feel
like
i
could
polish
off
at
least
four
of
these
without
batting
an
eye
before
i
would
need
to
make
special
travel
arrangements
home
if
i
were
to
continue
after
that
has
a
noticeably
fruity
flavor
that
is
otherwise
well
balanced
aside
from
that
stoudts
pils
has
an
immensely
drinkable
effervescent
mouthfeel
that
may
help
this
beer
supplant
victory
prima
pils
as
my
favorite
pilsner
available
in
my
general
area
o
compares
favorably
with
a
victory
prima
pils
and
a
troegs
sunshine
pils
but
i
dont
like
this
as
much
its
not
quite
as
smooth
as
the
other
two
good
though
and
worth
having
again
odone
of
the
better
pilseners
i
have
come
across
that
i
can
remember
hoppy
enough
but
has
proper
balance
plenty
to
like
about
this
brew
overall
i
would
recommend
this
brew
it
is
a
well
balanced
pilsner
a
great
beer
for
welcoming
the
summer
color
is
absolutely
pristine
pale
and
clear
shade
of
gold
big
white
head
that
sticks
around
and
leaves
a
generous
amount
of
lace
i
wouldnt
change
a
thing
about
how
this
beer
looks
the
smell
is
mostly
spicy
teutonic
hops
with
a
little
bit
of
graininess
as
well
tastes
great
really
comes
out
and
bites
with
the
hops
and
snaps
closed
with
a
dry
finish
the
hops
are
a
little
much
dont
get
me
wrong
im
loving
it
but
i
expected
a
little
more
balance
and
the
scales
are
tilted
in
favor
of
the
hops
here
good
easy
drinking
mouthfeel
on
this
one
clean
as
a
whistle
but
it
could
be
a
little
livelier
overall
an
absolutely
brilliant
refresher
just
about
everything
i
want
out
of
a
german
pils
however
if
the
hops
are
going
to
be
so
strong
for
the
style
i
could
do
with
a
little
more
depth
to
their
character
theyre
a
lot
more
spicy
than
floral
a
little
more
maltiness
for
balance
would
have
been
welcome
really
though
the
complaints
pale
in
comparison
to
the
achievements
of
this
astonishingly
well
crafted
and
authentic
beer
this
pilsner
was
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
making
come
across
unbalanced
it
was
however
drinkable
and
ultimately
enjoyable
its
worth
checking
out

that
reduces
to
a

that
lasts
nice

on

with
plenty
of

streaming
up

and
herbal
spiciness
on
the
finish
for
a

medium
carbonation
and

with
a
slightly
sticky

crisp
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
and
smooth
with
no
alcohol
in
the
taste
or
finish
as
expected
at

overall
this
is
a
fantastic
pilsner
and
definitely
one
of
the
best
i
have
had
very
drinkable
and
full
of
nice
hoppy
flavors
with
good
balance
this
held
up
surprisingly
well
considering
the
bottle
dating
o
a
very
nice
pilsner
very
drinkable
and
has
a
deeper
hop
character
than
most
ive
had
overall
pretty
solid
but
i
am
just
not
gravitating
towards
this
or
going
crazy
for
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
good
two
finger
bone
white
head
that
slowly
recedes
but
leaves
much
lace
as
she
fades
smells
of
sweet
bready
husky
pilsner
malt
with
just
enough
spicy
grassy
hops
to
keep
this
from
cloying
sweet
bready
pilsner
malt
flavor
balanced
with
spicy
grassy
hops
very
dry
finish
with
sharp
spicy
bite
medium
to
thin
body
with
a
spirited
level
of
carbonation
and
sweet
honey
like
mouthfeel
the
greatness
here
is
in
the
subtlety
of
the
flavors
and
how
well
the
hops
and
malts
contrast
each
other
nice
nice
drinker
here
when
i
poured
this
beer
into
the
glass
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
body
with
a
nice
white
fizzy
head
the
smell
is
sweetgrape
smell
and
some
earthy
hopsgrains
the
taste
is
crisp
the
nice
bitter
earthy
hops
on
the
tongue
the
mouth
feel
is
great
good
and
carbonated
and
overall
is
a
really
good
pilsner
finishes
slightly
sweet
tart
and
clean
i
wish
i
could
see
this
ontap
or
at
the
very
least
in
bottles
at
bars
around
my
area
great
beer
o
very
enjoyable
pils
as
expected
from
stoudts
rjt
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
tried
i
may
seek
this
out
again
next
summer
overall
thought
this
one
would
have
more
of
a
kick
but
it
just
never
got
off
the
ground
a
bit
better
as
it
warmed
just
not
impressed
o
crisp
drinkable
beer
pilseners
arent
my
favorite
style
but
i
think
this
one
is
done
quite
well
overall
its
ok
but
i
would
take
the
golden
lager
or
pale
ale
over
this
any
day
still
a
pretty
good
beer
if
your
a
fan
of
the
style
i
wish
the
aroma
were
more
pronounced
it
might
interfere
with
the
taste
then
but
i
still
would
prefer
more
finishing
hops
overall
this
is
a
petty
good
pils
and
if
i
were
in
the
mood
i
might
buy
it
again
o
its
a
pretty
drinkable
pilsener
and
the
taste
isnt
bad
could
drink
quite
a
bit
of
it
but
id
rather
drink
prima
pils
o
an
excellent
example
of
a
pilsener
and
one
of
the
better
i
have
had
this
year
picked
this
up
in
a
mixed
six
but
will
pick
it
up
as
long
as
the
weather
is
appropriate
this
brew
does
taste
a
lot
better
than
it
smells
after
a
second
and
third
sip
the
dryness
that
you
experience
toward
the
end
of
your
experience
starts
to
creep
to
the
middle
of
the
palate
thats
a
good
thing
and
the
bigger
gulps
you
take
the
more
your
tongue
is
just
overwhelmed
with
the
hops
its
a
good
beer
and
id
totally
drink
this
again
bottoms
up
people
overall
a
solid
pils
no
doubt
overall
i
am
impressed
by
stoudts
overall
there
is
nothing
german
about
this
pilsener
more

sweetness

off

by

then
a

the

sharply
bitter
way
too
much
for

should

soft

drinkable
overall
this
was
a
disappointment
for
me
the
nose
hinted
at
great
things
to
come

the
palate
seemed
disjointed

not
soft
enough
for
the

drinkability
a

quite

i
poured
this
into

glass
i
got
from
a
cafe
in
bonn
germany
i
let
it
go
in
a
bit
too
hard
and
got
a
whole
hands
worth
of
white
head
the
liquid
was
translucent
with
a
straw
yellow
color
all
the
head
laced
nicely
it
had
a
dry
lemony
aroma
the
taste
was
considerably
sour
and
bitter
too
much
so
i
know
i
opened
this
before
the
date
on
the
bottle
so
im
assuming
that
its
not
gone
bad
but
this
is
weird
the
bitterness
lingers
considerably
i
cant
find
any
sweetness
to
offset
the
bitter
after
some
time
passes
it
begins
to
improve
some
its
it
feels
ok
in
the
mouth
except
for
the
aftertaste
ive
enjoyed
all
of
stoudts
other
products
and
unless
im
just
missing
something
on
the
pilsener
style
this
isnt
much
fun
maybe
all
that
head
was
a
sign
of
a
problem
darn
drinkability
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
for
those
days
by
the
pool
d
the
pils
is
very
drinkable
an
excellent
representative
of
the
style
d
i
wouldnt
put
it
on
the
same
shelf
as
victory
prima
pils
this
is
a
good
starter
pilsener
refreshing
nonetheless
and
id
pick
up
another
one
if
in
the
adamstown
area
12oz
bottle
this
one
pours
a

color
with
a
bit
of
a

it
it

off
rather
quickly
to
leave

aroma
is
nice
with
notes
of

floral
notes
definitely
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
the
taste

body
backing
ot
up
a
somewhat
dry
finish
not
a
bad
pils
at
all
hell
yes
this
is
one
wonderful
pils
the
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
body
that
has
ever
present
carbonation
with
a
white
head
that
crowns
it
leaving
nice
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
where
at
first
very
floral
hoppy
but
it
also
had
a
very
nice
malt
backbone
its
as
complex
as
a
lager
can
be
the
beer
was
a
very
refreshing
drink
that
finished
extremely
dry
one
of
my
new
lawn
mowing
beers
this
pils
had
multilevel
bitterness
just
as
it
started
to
fade
it
pushed
forward
again
it
nearly
overpowered
all
the
other
flavors
at
times
i
think
ill
have
to
revisit
this

clear
and
strawcolored

huge
foamy
head
that
dissipates
to
a
thin

big

nose
also
a
bit
of
corn
and
spice
hops
jump
out
at
you
on

with
a
bit
of
spice
and
a
lot
of
hoppy
bitterness
with
a
lingering
bitterness
that
stays
long
on
the
palate
this
is
an
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
pils
drinkability

this
is
one
of
the
few
truly
drinkable
examples
of
a
german
pilsner
ive
had
made
here
in
the
us
well
done
stoudts
d
for
the
style
it
is
on
target
but
just
a
little
off
of
course
this
is
my
opinion
as
for
drinkability
this
beer
is
great
i
tasted
it
after
one
of
the
hottest
days
of
the
year
and
it
was
perfect
refreshing
may
be
too
hoppy
for
some
but
could
easily
be
a
saturday
afternoon
drinking
beer
pours
a
greenish
yellow
hue
not
ultra
pale
or
clear
around
the
edges
though
holds
a
thick
head
that
i
have
to
let
settle
due
to
intense
carbonation
smells
resinous
and
spicy
mostly
of
hops
but
not
intimidatingly
so
taste
is
again
ultra
hoppy
fairly
good
hop
profile
tastes
salty
the
malt
being
overshadowed
all
around
resinous
and
this
is
what
lasts
on
the
tongue
in
the
same
flavor
profile
as
prima
pils
mouthfeel
is
light
in
a
pils
waynot
waterso
good
in
this
regard
but
its
so
carbonated
its
just
overkill
drinkability
wise
its
too
hoppy
to
apreciate
the
other
things
going
on
here
im
saddened
by
the
reoccuring
need
for
beers
to
be
extreme
or
take
a
mellow
but
flavorful
style
like
a
pilsner
and
try
and
make
it
what
its
not
the
name
of
the
good
brewing
game
is
balance
and
this
does
not
achieve
it
but
if
your
a
hopehead
this
or
prima
pils
are
the
kind
of
pils
you
may
shoot
for
as
they
will
blast
you
with
a
different
style
of
nottoomalty
hop
water
for
your
apreciation
of
all
the
varieties
of
hops
for
me
no
thanks
12
oz
bottle
perfectly
clear
straw
yellow
in
color
with
a
great
big
head
the
smell
was
of
malt
and
flowery
hops
light
dms
the
taste
was
primarily
driven
by
the
hops
which
provided
good
bittering
malt
was
definately
taking
a
back
seat
body
was
light
carbonation
was
moderate
and
it
was
fairly
drying
a
very
drinkable
beer
crisp
and
refreshing
this
was
an
enjoyable
pils
a
style
which
ive
never
really
gotten
all
too
crazed
about
its
simple
to
the
point
and
well
crafted
and
tasty
try
it
very
hoppy
aroma
and
taste
excellent
appearance
on
the
pour
almost
clear
yellow
with
a
frothy
whire
head
and
good
lacing
i
could
not
detect
much
flavor
outside
the
heavy
hops
this
actually
grew
on
me
after
a
couple
but
my
beer
is
how
i
rated
it
an
okaygood
middle
of
the
road
pilsner
d
too
bitter
for
my
tastes
but
does
goes
down
easy
assertive
but
herbal
hop
aroma
with
some
hay
and
very
mild
orange
peel
notes
color
is
light
yellow
and
the
body
holds
a
fluffy
white
two
finger
thick
head
that
diminishes
slowly
fore
is
grainy
tasting
and
has
grapefruit
accented
hop
notes
very
clean
middle
and
finish
leaves
grapefruit
and
floral
hop
flavors
lingering
on
the
tongue
the
malt
base
is
noticeable
but
the
hops
are
running
the
show
flavor
wise
i
have
passed
this
one
up
many
times
for
no
good
reason
the
summer
solstice
has
visited
upon
us
again
and
pilsners
sound
so
delightful
this
one
displays
a
nice
golden
hue
a
head
as
white
as
the
driven
snow
frothed
up
off
the
pour
and
fell
into
nothingness
with
only
a
ring
left
in
its
memory
lacing
is
minimal
the
beer
is
nicely
carbonated
with
bubbles
of
different
sizes
that
go
bludgeoning
upward
the
smell
is
sharp
with
nobility
a
bit
of
corn
impression
and
peppery
spiciness
comes
to
mind
herbal
and
dry
grass
tones
spring
forth
as
well
the
flavour
is
very
tasteful
it
is
utterly
pleasant
and
appealing
without
so
much
as
a
challenge
to
the
palate
it
has
great
hop
bite
it
tends
to
be
dry
but
wet
enough
to
be
greatly
refreshing
which
was
exactly
what
i
was
looking
for
in
this
beer
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
tingly
it
is
superb
from
a
drinkability
standpoint
i
am
compelled
to
go
to
the
fridge
repeatedly
and
grasp
yet
another
bottle
but
alas
my
stash
is
nearly
depleted
now
this
is
an
easy
recommendation
i
only
wish
i
had
delved
into
this
beers
splendor
in
a
more
timely
fashion
nice
work
this
one
has
won
numerous
awards
well
deserved
wish
i
didnt
know
that
when
i
tasted
it
my
czech
friend
concurs
though
its
very
good
for
an
american
brewed
pils
tastes
grassy
with
a
strong
presence
if
noble
hops
herbal
and
strong
tasty
crisp
mouth
some
light
aftertaste
of
sour
malt
and
noble
hops
good
drinker
nice
summer
beer
a
new
fave
cheers
drinkability
this
one
is
highly
drinkable
especially
for
the
summer
or
with
bbq
you
wont
get
bored
with
the
flavors
but
it
wont
bog
you
down
very
sessionable
not
totally
blown
away
by
this
beer
but
its
a
solid
brew
it
could
easily
be
my
budwiser
just
a
solid
pilsner
that
is
easy
to
drink
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
light
straw
color
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
that
stuck
like
glue
as
it
settledvery
german
in
the
nose
toasted
grain
and
mineral
qualities
with
a
touch
herbalness
saaz
maybevery
dry
pils
here
dry
toasted
malt
underneath
a
drysomewhat
herbal
hop
profile
i
do
notice
a
s
i
drink
more
a
freshly
baked
bread
elemeant
to
it
that
adds
to
its
subtle
complexities
of
malt
vs
hop
a
damn
fine
pilsner
one
of
the
better
to
come
my
way
in
a
while
for
sure
drinkability
eminently
drinkable
especially
wellflavored
light
and
welcoming
great
sessioner
excellent
depth
in
flavor
profile
a
fine
job
very
drinkable
very
enjoyable
and
you
better
believe
from
now
on
ill
be
watching
stoudts
more
closely
to
see
what
other
suprises
they
have
waiting
in
the
wings
this
is
an
extremely
clean
and
refeshing
beer
while
isnt
anything
in
the
way
of
off
flavors
the
flavor
is
pretty
mellow
there
is
a
little
bit
of
lemon
citrus
and
grassiness
that
combines
with
a
mild
malt
sweetness
the
hop
bite
comes
through
at
the
end
the
body
is
on
the
full
side
for
a
pilsner
but
it
is
extremely
drinkable
due
to
how
clean
it
is
going
down
drinkability
refreshing
more
of
an
american
take
on
a
pilsner
using
noble
aroma
hops
but
untraditional
bittering
hops
drinkability
wow
i
dont
know
if
i
got
a
good
bottle
or
what
im
so
impressed
with
this
one
ive
never
seen
a
pilsner
like
this
drinkability
yes
i
enjoyed
it
at
work
even
a
tasty
pilsner
from
stoudts
a
solid
pils
although
the
bitterness
is
a
touch
too
much
for
me
and
i
would
like
to
have
more
aroma
hops
a
competitor
to
victory
prima
pils
for
authenticity
but
not
as
drinkable
i
like
the
slightly
sweeter
pils
akin
to
steinlager
i
very
much
like
german
pils
and
am
glad
to
see
more
and
more
craft
adaptations
very
enjoyable
much
like
samuel
adams
and
saranacs
golden
pils
up
there
with
sunshine
and
prima
for
great
hoppy
style
pilsners
strong
yet
refreshing
it
poured
into
the
glass
with
a
strong
yellow
color
and
a
decent
sized
fizzy
head
hoppy
in
all
the
right
places
not
overbearing
and
perhaps
lacking
the
sheer
power
of
prima
but
still
perfectly
balanced
and
refreshing
and
a
great
choice
for
any
pils
fan
in
any
weather
undated

poured
into
a

pale
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
thin
white
cap
of
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
while
and
leave
some
scattered

nice
and
malty
overlaid
with
fairly
spicey

taste
is
a
nice
slightly
sweet
malt
a
bit
of
fruitiness
with
a
nice
dry
finish
with
some
spicey

bitterness
this
is
a
really
good
pilsner
right
up
there
with
the
other
great
examples
from
pathe
prima
and
the
sunshine
be
underwhelmed
if
you
must
i
like
the
stuff
new
arrival
at
my
local
package
store
in
a
six
pack
of
12
oz
brown
bottles
featuring
hops
on
the
label
to
see
the
flowers
of
the
humulus
lupulus
vine
always
a
good
sign
to
me
the
beer
looked
appropriately
pale
and
very
clear
the
clarity
proved
a
showcase
of
the
highly
bubbly
nature
of
the
beer
which
produced
a
foamy
white
head
that
was
bigger
than
typical
for
a
pils
at
nearly
two
fingers
thick
the
aroma
was
that
of
restrained
spicy
noble
hops
and
the
sweet
honey
like
pilsner
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
vegetal
dms
the
taste
was
clean
and
balanced
with
sweet
malt
with
a
hint
of
corn
just
edging
out
the
hops
due
to
the
lack
of
bitterness
this
one
wasnt
quite
flawlessly
crisp
but
was
flavorful
enough
to
overlook
the
bit
of
muddiness
the
beer
felt
quite
full
in
the
mouth
considering
the
style
and
a
spicy
aftertaste
i
would
pick
this
any
day
of
the
week
over
the
swill
being
foisted
on
the
uneducated
public
but
there
are
other
better
microbrewed
pilsners
out
there
overall
an
easily
drinkable
pilsner
with
a
light
enjoyable
flavor
just
a
little
too
weak
watery
for
me
i
dont
drink
pilsners
but
this
is
a
good
1
for
those
of
you
who
do
being
wet
and
no
trouble
down
the
throat
is
the
order
of
the
day
and
stoudts
pils
fills
the
bill
this
is
one
of
the
palest
colored
beers
i
ever
have
seen
i
think
friggin
bud
light
has
more
color
however
the
lacing
raised
the
appearance
up
a
bit
as
it
was
quite
plentiful
from
the
well
reataining
head
nice
malty
aroma
inviting
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
made
this
one
enjoyable
beer
if
it
was
available
in
this
area
mighjt
be
the
pilslager
of
choice
for
the
dog
days
of
summer
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
thanks
to
rkhaze
for
the
sample
goes
down
quite
smooth
lots
of
rechargeability
so
theres
nothing
to
get
sick
of
and
theres
always
some
taste
left
in
it
crisp
refreshing
and
lots
of
hop
taste
a
delightful
and
drinkable
pils
thank
you
kevin
for
sharing
this
one
with
me

is
spicy
hops
scant
pale

and
a
ong
sharp
dry

just
enough
bitternes
sto
make
it
ever
so
interesting
a
nice
counterpoint
to
randy
newmans
baltimore
with
the
eagles
on
background
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
pils
and
makes
for
a
great
session
beer
the
grape
taste
sets
it
apart
and
makes
it
a
unique
offering
in
this
style
im
not
a
pilsner
fan
but
this
is
a
quality
brew
drunk
with
good
conversation
at
graces
tavern
in
philly
overall
a
very
nice
pils
and
one
that
ill
be
drinking
again
not
quite
on
par
with
victory

a
good
representation
nonetheless

good
with
fish
bold
medium
mouthfeel
i
would
recommend
getting
a
sixer
of
this
brew
it
grew
on
me
over
time
my
first
reaction
was
this
is
gobble
material
for
a
party
after
completing
my
last
sample
on
tap
at
najas
in
redondo
beach
this
has
moved
up
to
possibly
in
the
esteemed
sunday
football
status
drinkability
and
overall
this
is
a
highly
underrated
pilsener
that
really
should
be
recognized
more
one
of
the
best
american
examples
of
the
style
clean
and
pure
i
think
ill
have
another
overall
not
bad
cost
1
69
for
the
pleasure
of
the
single
not
sure
i
would
pick
up
a
6pack
of
these
but
i
wouldnt
pass
one
up
if
it
was
passing
by
overall
not
a
bad
beer
i
havent
reviewed
too
many
german
pilsners
so
i
dont
have
that
much
to
go
by
but
damn
this
is
tasty
you
could
drink
this
an
entire
sunday
watching
football
and
still
go
back
for
another
highly
recommended
drinkability
strong
bitterness
that
doesnt
linger
leads
for
great
food
pairing
i
had
this
with
garlic
pepper
pork
very
good
the
refreshing
nature
makes
it
go
down
easy
overall
a
light
refreshing
pilsner
that
reminded
me
more
of
an
adjunct
rather
than
a
craft
brew
mouthfeel
is
bubbley
and
a
bit
chewy
and
overall
very
drinkable
extremely
refreshing
and
tasty
goes
down
easy
and
terribly
tempting
to
grab
another
bought
a
bottle
of
this
last
week
looks
to
have
a
best
buy
date
of
82205
very
nice
pour
is
a
light
golden
the
head
was
of
the
beaten
egg
white
quality
and
did
a
good
job
of
sticking
around
this
beer
was
kind
of
a
mixed
bag
for
me
i
popped
it
open
while
i
started
cooking
so
i
took
sips
every
five
minutes
or
so
while
i
had
a
moment
each
sip
was
different
the
first
actually
had
a
bit
of
a
sour
quality
and
i
thought
please
get
better
soon
actually
its
still
evident
30
minutes
later
there
are
some
more
pleasant
things
going
on
it
is
pretty
citrusy
in
the
finish
i
actually
find
it
bit
sweet
too
sitting
here
drinking
this
one
in
front
of
the
computer
i
have
to
say
its
a
bit
of
a
mishmash
i
guess
i
need
to
get
another
bottle
and
see
if
there
is
a
change
for
a
better
drinking
experience
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
nice
1
inch
white
head
left
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
nice
steady
flow
of
bubbles
gives
it
a
nice
lively
appearance
smell
is
mostly
of
malt
with
a
very
mild
hops
smell
taste
the
same
with
the
hops
bitterness
showing
up
at
the
finish
even
though
it
appeared
to
have
strong
carbonation
there
was
little
of
the
carbonation
feal
on
the
tongue
very
smooth
and
clean
finish
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
would
be
a
good
one
to
try
on
your
macro
loving
friends
this
pils
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
about
an
inch
of
snowy
head
it
has
evident
hoppiness
in
the
nose
which
sets
it
up
well
i
drank
one
while
hot
and
thirsty
and
it
went
down
easily
with
a
slight
bite
though
mostly
clean
easy
to
have
another
the
malt
was
just
bit
thin
to
me
although
the
mouthfeel
was
crisp
nice
summer
beer
for
sure
although
this
is
lighter
than
the
usual
microbrew
fare
this
is
an
excellent
flavorful
beer
too
good
to
be
called
a
lawn
mower
beer
yet
it
would
be
an
awesome
choice
after
the
chores
are
complete
lots
of
carbonation
activity
going
on
but
not
apparent
in
the
mouthfeel
the
smell
and
taste
both
have
a
little
more
hops
than
i
was
expecting
the
hops
are
more
of
the
grapefruit
variety
than
the
pine
variety
aftertaste
is
all
grapefruit
bitterness
i
am
drinking
this
beer
at
a
warmer
than
normal
temp
which
i
suspect
accounts
fof
the
stronger
than
average
hop
factor
enjoyable
brew
pours
a
clear
golden
color
lots
of
tiny
bubbles
coming
from
the
bottom
of
the

it
is
very

a
very

u

version
of
a
europils
fundamental
and
drinkable
i
had
written
stoudts
off
but
their
new
line
up
and
tweaking
has
produced
two
great
beers
this
one
and
the
sublime

ipa

under
a
drift
of
fatbubbled

aromas
of

drizzled

so
easy
and
soft
this
beer
a
gorgeous
mingling
of
toast
lightly
lathered
with
apricot
jam
and
river
stones
i
could
drink
this
all
day
then
crack
one
at
sundown
to
celebrate
my
day
of
drinking
a
fine
american
pils
that
should
be
available
everywhere
like
iron
filings
to
my
electromagnetic
lips
flavor
is
balanced
and
assertiveslighty
sweet
malty
notes
work
in
harmony
with
a
tangy
citrus
hop
flavor
and
a
hop
finish
thats
sharp
but
not
big
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
refreshing
the
hopping
is
more
likely
to
make
you
think
of
california
beers
than
the
budweis
but
its
enjoyable
nonetheless
a
nice
summer
refresher
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
refreshing
at
the
start
the
finish
was
clean
and
crisp
this
is
extremely
drinkable
as
the
flavor
and
refreshing
crisp
quality
makes
your
tastebuds
very
happy

a

liked

in

a

the

very
good
german

there

refreshing
pils
very
crisp
and
refreshing
offering
by
stoudts
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
clean
pale
malt
and
czech
hop
scent
it
is
a
bit
grainy
but
good
the
taste
is
good
it
has
a
grainy
pale
malt
flavor
with
excellent
hop
notes
in
the
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
good
as
well
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
fine
pilsner
its
simple
in
its
approach
but
it
has
all
the
elements
of
a
quality
brew
the
aroma
was
surprisingly
hoppy
fresh
cut
alfalfa
a
surprising
hop
characteristic
from
a
pils
but
definitely
welcome
the
taste
followed
with
the
same
dominant
green
hop
flavor
but
didnt
prevent
the
clean
and
crisp
pils
malt
flavor
from
reaching
the
palate
it
had
a
great
taste
but
the
accumulation
of
bitterness
was
somewhat
significant
maybe
a
bit
too
much
hop
final
thought
these
beers
still
taste
much
better
on
tap
but
the
bottled
beer
still
tastes
great
complements
to
ed
stoudt
appearance
pale

glad
to
see
stoudts
finally
deliver
this
offering
in
bottles
poured
from
the
pint
bottle
a
clear
golden
with
light
white
head
that
settled
down
to
a
nice
little
ring
bought
from
stoudts
scents
of
champagne
white
grapes
maybe
a

honey
very

little
bit
of

chardonnay
decent
beer
little
light
for
me
though
very
drinkable
i
really
wanted
to
love
this
beer
great
pilsners
are
tough
to
make
and
therefore
quite
rare
on
the
micro
scene
imho
this
one
started
off
good
but
quickly
showed
its
flaws
this
pils
poured
a
clear
goldenyellow
color
with
white
foam
that
settled
but
clung
to
the
glass
a
little
the
smell
was
modest
but
clean
with
a
faint
aroma
of
malt
the
taste
was
malty
and
floral
with
some
grain
flavors
the
hop
bitterness
was
low
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
mediumlight
body
and
low
carbonation
feel
the
flavor
both
malt
and
floral
hops
lingered
nicely
this
was
a
nice
lighter
bodied
pils
straw
yellow
colored
with
a
slight
protein
haze
in
the
pint
glass
frothy
white
thick
lasting
head
not
much
nose
just
a
little
clean
malt
in
the
sinus
crisp
tangy
flavor
dominates
the
mouth
crisp
solid
hop
presence
there
is
also
some
lingering
sweetness
to
the
finish
quite
lite
and
drinkable
a
beer
you
could
easily
have
a
few
of
gret
with
food
the
flavor
is
wellbalanced
between
a
semirich
maltiness
and
lush
hop
flavors
and
its
distinctly
bitter
but
not
overwhelming
it
finishes
dry
and
refreshing
with
some
shortlingering
malt
and
gently
bitter
hops
crisp
cleanand
full
of
flavor
this
is
one
wellbrewed
and
highly
drinkable
germanstyle
pils
this
beer
poured
crystal
clear
and
well
carbonated
it
was
the
color
of
hay
that
glistened
in
the
sun
it
produced
a
fluffy
cloud
like
head
that
was
pure
white
in
color
and
thick
full
and
sticky
the
lace
that
was
produced
was
the
same
color
and
very
plentiful
sticky
and
lasted
to
glass
the
aromas
were
mostly
of
2
kinds
of
hops
czechoslovakian
and
saaz
these
hops
produced
a
light
fruit
and
flowery
aroma
all
through
out
the
bottle
and
glass
but
as
it
warmed
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
did
rise
and
become
noticeable
the
tastes
were
very
much
like
the
aroma
czechoslovakian
and
saaz
hops
ruled
but
other
flavors
did
arise
light
tastes
of
grass
malt
grains
and
spice
also
were
noticeable
it
finished
with
a
dry
hop
flower
taste
on
the
tongue
that
was
noticeable
even
when
i
exhaled
it
was
light
bodied
a
fairly
dry
beer
that
was
crisp
and
clean
not
overly
hoped
but
enough
to
satisfy
good
balance
of
flavors
to
represent
the
style
quenched
my
thirst
and
satisfied
me
the
pils
pours
a
brassy
gold
with
a
fine
white
head
choice
saaz
hop
aroma
blowing
off
it
like
clouds
on
a
mountian
brisk
almost
fruity
softly
malty
evenly
hoppy
but
at
no
place
overwhelming
this
is
allday
beer
the
only
place
the
hops
show
their
edge
is
in
the
long
relentless
finish
that
is
a
moderate
pleasant
bitterness
quite
soft
and
unassuming
up
front
it
gains
interest
as
it
goes
in
classic
bohemian
pils
style
like
a
stream
down
a
mountain
classic
yellow
gold
fluffy
twofinger
head
excellent

lots
of

taste

a
sturdy
malt
backbone
behind
a
wall
of
hops
with
a
slight
lemon
twang
mouthfeel
is
pleasantly
full
nice
mild
hoppy
aftertaste
a
solid
pils
refreshing
not
only
in
summer
but
anytime
light
straw
in
color
lazy
floating
bubbles
with

some
trases
of

evening
awesome
german
pilsner
try
one
o
this
blew
my
mind
for
a
beer
my
wife
found
at
aldis
aldi
is
a
german
company
and
they
had
other
beer
pretty
cheap
that
im
going
to
have
to
try
that
is
insane
i
believe
this
beer
gets
underrated
granted
it
is
not
the
best
example
of
a
german
pils
but
because
it
is
easy
to
find
at
my
local
aldi
only
6
00
a
six
pack
it
makes
it
a
go
to
beer
for
me
pours
clear
golden
color
with
a
slight
head
some
lacing
it
has
an
initial
bite
and
slight
bitterness
on
the
back
of
tongue
but
it
gets
smoother
the
more
you
drink
dont
they
all
also
because
it
is
not
a
high
alcohol
content
makes
a
decent
session
beer
paired
with
a
grilled
smithfield
pork
sirloin
some
spaetlze
or
some
potato
gnocchi
and
a
spinach
and
tomato
salad
very
nice
good
served
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
i
know
some
people
say
germans
drink
beer
warm
this
is
absolutely
false
they
just
dont
chill
beer
as
cold
as
americans
brits
drink
beer
a
bit
warmer
wernesgruner
is
nice
beer
for
the
price
surprisingly
smooth
and
not
bitter
for
6
o
easy
to
drink
and
fairly
enjoyable
though
not
outstanding
pairs
well
with
just
about
any
food
not
too
shabby
overall
an
okay
pils
but
gets
borderline
adjunct
flavors
got
this
really
cheap
at
aldi
so
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
would
make
better
mower
beer
drinks
easy
and
quenches
your
thirst
it
is
by
no
means
anything
special
pretty
or
delicious
but
it
is
good
after
working
in
the
sun
not
the
best
mot
the
worst
your
best
option
is
probably
getting
it
real
cold
and
drinking
it
from
the
can
with
a
coozy
if
youve
got
one
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
clear
dull
light
to
medium
golden
with
a
pretty
well
defined
white
head
that
left
a
few
broken
chunks
of
lace
as
it
settled
pretty
quickly
sweeter
aromas
with
a
mild
crispnessmore
like
a
sweet
cereal
aroma
more
than
anything
the
sweet
cereal
grain
notes
are
what
you
get
mainly
on
the
palate
with
just
a
light
drying
leafy
hop
note
in
the
finish
eh
pretty
average
but
it
goes
well
with
food
and
is
pretty
drinkable
in
an
average
kind
of
way
o
a
runofthemill
pils
this
beer
is
amazing
in
its
ability
to
be
neither
great
nor
bad
its
middle
of
the
road
to
the
extreme
imagine
german
bud
light
except
with
more
mildbitter
hops
maybe
saaz
better
dollar
for
dollar
than
bmc
apparently
abv
is
4
9
but
seems
lower
as
i
just
finished
a
sixxer
and
am
not
too
buzzed
just
tried
this
because
it
was
available
at
aldis
on
my
grocery
run
and
i
had
never
tried
it
initially
refreshing
nice
and
light
the
aftertaste
is
a
bit
strange
almost
soapy
i
think
the
appearance
was
perfectly
fine
poured
into
a
glass
the
head
was
light
and
foamy
not
dense
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
perfectly
acceptable
for
the
price
much
better
brews
can
be
bought
from
any
grocery
store
overall
a
good
pils
but
wish
it
was
a
little
heavier
bodied
still
one
of
the
better
ones
out
there
od
not
a
bad
version
of
the
style
herbal
hop
note
was
pleasant
easy
drinking
a
subtle
but
enjoyable
pils
with
typical
flavours
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
picked
up
this
brew
at
aldis
a
great
new
neighborhood
food
store
that
has
prices
that
blow
the
other
supermarkets
into
the
weeds
lets
give
it
a
whirl
poppingthe
top
i
get
a
nice
full
bottle
with
a
malty
and
barley
malt
smell
no
adjuncts
here
on
the
pour
into
my
sapp
i
get
a
clear
lightly
golden
color
with
a
thick
foamy
two
finger
head
on
the
taste
this
brew
is
delightfully
crisp
and
clean
with
a
nice
sharp
hoppiness
that
is
semi
bitter
right
along
side
a
sweet
maltiness
mouthfeel
is
thin
but
that
is
the
norm
for
this
style
so
no
downgrade
very
refreshing
and
a
great
brew
for
a
hot
summer
day
i
would
buy
again
prost
lampertland
this
is
a
really
great
german
pils
especially
for
the
price
8
99
canadian
for
a
4
can
pack
it
is
pretty
similar
to
bitburger
but
i
would
say
the
difference
being
that
wernesgruner
is
more
hops
oriented
and
bitburger
is
more
malt
oriented
i
think
the
thing
that
impresses
me
most
with
this
beer
is
how
well
balanced
it
is
definitely
a
great
session
brew
especially
in
the
summer
time
as
its
very
refreshing
but
also
full
of
flavour
overal
35
sidenote
yes
its
far
from
the
best
pilsner
but
at
least
where
im
from
ontario
its
one
of
the
best
for
the
price
currently
2
05
for
a
500ml
can
not
shabby
at
all
o
it
was
slightly
above
average
for
me
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
but
it
was
okay
nothing
stunning
or
me
fairly
dull
in
my
opinion
overall
not
bad
but
it
reminds
me
of
a
typical
beer
from
the
big
brewers
its
decent
on
the
low
end
of
pilsner
nothing
id
really
look
for
but
ive
had
alot
worse
beer
this
is
a
pretty
basic
beer
but
its
slightly
similar
to
some
better
quality
imports
which
makes
it
slightly
endearing
and
its
not
costy
at
all
a
good
solution
for
a
few
cheap
ass
tallcans
if
you
dont
mind
a
few
odd
off
hints
this
beer
might
be
for
you
as
for
me
not
exactly
my
fave
but
its
better
than
some
although
it
had
over
7
months
to
expiration
date
there
was
some
metallic
hint
present
a
little
oxidized
off
flavor
overall
some
nice
flavors
nothing
complicated
though
body
holds
its
own
can
pours
a
light
straw
colour
with
lots
of
fine
carbonation
and
a
reasonable
but
light
foamy
white
head
a
green
aroma
of
grass
and
hops
the
taste
starts
with
a
bready
sweetness
before
rapidly
transitioning
into
a
surprising
hop
bitterness
this
dryness
is
a
very
pleasant
surprise
more
like
a
czechstyle
pilsner
without
the
saaz
than
a
typical
mild
sweet
germanic
style
would
definitely
recommend
not
a
bad
beer
but
find
it
pretty
onedimensional
and
the
bitterness
as
the
overwhelming
character
i
find
make
it
less
than
easily
drinkable
and
a
touch
annoying
3

i
had
this
beer
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
pale
straw
colour
with
a
thin
film
of
head
smells
primarily
of
grass
and
barley
with
a
bit
of
sour
notes
as
well
tastes
sweet
at
first
with
the
malts
and
finishes
with
some
grassy
bitterness
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
dry
its
drinkable
after
a
hot
day
of
mowing
the
lawn
but
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
o
decent
how
to
say
this
nicely
beats
the
heck
out
of
us
big
name
pilsners
but
that
is
a
pretty
low
bar
so
if
that
were
my
choice
id
drink
this
again
i
poured
the
beer
from
a
bottle
into
a
glass
the
head
started
off
thick
but
faded
with
some
lacing
the
color
was
golden
and
very
clear
the
nose
is
mainly
malt
with
hints
of
grass
and
a
metallic
note
the
taste
is
bready
from
the
malts
and
fades
to
a
slight
metallic
bite
mouthfeel
is
light
but
with
good
carbonation
i
like
this
better
than
the
holland
1839
lager
that
aldi
sells
it
does
make
an
interesting
comparison
to
american
pilsners
ild
like
to
try
some
in
making
beer
rolls
o
decent
but
not
great
even
at
6
dollars
a
six
pack
i
wont
be
rushing
back
to
buy
more
the
wernesgruner
is
a
bit
sharp
as
compared
to
other
germen
pils
what
i
mean
by
sharp
it
has
a
rougher
grainy
edge
this
beer
pours
a
crystal
clear
pale
straw
colour
with
two
fingers
of
thin
puffy
foamy
white
head
which
yields
a
nice
lace
it
smells
of
grain
and
muted
floral
hops
the
taste
is
sharp
burst
of
grain
with
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
in
body
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
was
a
tough
pils
o
an
ok
pilsner
lacking
in
fruity
bitterness
and
earthy
robustness
its
unique
however
something
about
it
tastes
contrived
and
mass
produced
i
will
say
that
it
is
better
than
most
sixers
at
the
5
99
price
point
this
beer
is
ok
i
dont
feel
like
ill
be
making
any
special
trips
to
aldi
to
pick
up
a
six
of
it
however
poured
into
a
pint
glass
straw
colored
with
a
decent
finger
white
head
that
dissipated
a
bit
but
retained
well
the
scent
was
light
grassy
with
some
citrus
i
detected
a
taste
of
hoppiness
with
lemon
that
match
well
with
the
smell
maybe
even
a
little
pepperiness
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
no
surprises
or
disappointments
overall
a
slightly
above
average
pilsner
not
bad
for
the
buy
o
a
tasty
pils
and
certainly
a
lot
better
than
i
was
anticipating
from
what
appears
to
be
a
mass
produced
tall
can
still
it
reminds
you
of
what
lures
you
to
the
style
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
just
not
a
worldclass
beer
final
grade
3
62
an
acceptable
b
grade
o
this
was
surprisingly
good
a
6
for
a
six
pack
worked
great
on
a
warm
day
while
grilling
dr
why
did
i
buy
this
the
abv
isnt
high
enough
for
the
beer
to
even
be
considered
a
crap
beer
its
just
downright
not
worth
it
the
price
is
especially
low
but
still
doesnt
justify
the
poor
quality
this
is
one
for
ye
lads
to
avoid
like
the
fecking
hiv
too
far
overall
see
drinkability
golden
crystal
clear
minimal
clumped
and
frothy
head
that
settles
into
a
wispy
layering
bit
of
spice
in
the
nose
with
some
faint
grain
husk
and
honeylike
aroma
unique
spicy
hop
presence
is
fairly
strong
up
front
very
dry
and
biscuity
little
to
no
residual
sweetness
from
the
malt
grain
and
hay
seem
to
go
side
by
side
with
the
spicy
hop
flavor
very
bitter
hoppy
finish
mouth
is
left
with
a
case
of
cottonmouth
after
each
sip
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
seems
a
tad
over
carbed
dry
and
light
bodied
overall
its
an
enjoyable
pils
for
sure
o
avoid
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
but
pilsner
lovers
would
probably
judge
this
higher
and
i
would
recommend
it
for
them
dpretty
drinkable
as
all
macros
are
overall
if
you
want
a
generic
crap
watered
down
pilsner
like
a
bud
but
slightly
different
this
is
your
brew
i
cant
get
over
how
clear
this
brew
is
without
the
slightest
hint
of
yellow
it
would
look
like
water
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
low
abv
d
very
nice
id
have
another
d
eh
wouldnt
buy
again
due
to
that
strange
aftertaste
good
beer
that
will
go
on
my
wont
let
you
down
list
d
somewhat
drinkable
used
to
love
this
taste
along
with
becks
and
hienie
but
tastes
have
changed
not
bad
though
just
not
me
for
fans
of
german
pilsners
this
should
not
be
missed
it
has
a
unique
character
thats
charming
and
interesting
it
could
be
more
rounded
and
balanced
yes
but
that
would
be
to
take
away
some
of
its
uniqueness
worth
seeking
out
d
average
pilsener
this
is
a
step
above
most
pils
in
a
can
as
it
actually
finishes
fresh
and
crisp
with
a
real
bitterness
to
the
beer
pale
yellow
colour
with
a
very
white
head
the
nose
is
noble
hops
and
the
taste
is
very
dry
for
the
style
i
need
to
have
a
bunch
of
these
in
the
fridge
this
winter
to
counterpoint
the
heavy
sweetish
winter
beers
that
i
usually
drink
probably
one
of
the
best
euro
pilsners
for
your
buck
at
least
in
ontario
where
cans
of
this
run
you
around
2
bucks
a
pop
a
solid
brew
easy
to
drink
crisp
refreshing
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
drink
one
of
the
better
euro
beers
out
there
it
is
very
refreshing
and
highly
sessionable
especially
during
the
summer
months
thin
body
crisp
and
clean
with
a
palatecleansing
bitterness
a
good
germanstyle
dry
pils
do
well
if
youre
a
fan
of
it
id
suppose
these
would
go
down
pretty
easily
overall
not
a
bad
germanstyle
pils
thanks
again
jerdmier
poured
to
a
very
white
two
fingered
head
brew
itself
was
a
very
light
yellow
in
color
head
hung
around
a
long
time
had
some
decent
lacing
smelled
very
light
almost
no
smell
going
on
just
a
straw
smell
and
very
light
sweetness
had
a
light
sweetness
taste
to
it
almost
like
apples
again
very
light
taste
had
a
slight
bitter
aftertaste
felt
good
in
the
mouth
i
thought
the
carbonation
was
about
right
not
a
lot
of
alcohol
you
could
make
this
a
session
beer
with
no
problem
ill
buy
again
pours
a
pale
strawyellow
colour
with
very
a
finger
of
white
head
that
takes
a
long
time
to
dissipate
small
lacing
around
the
glass
hops
come
through
in
the
smell
with
some
bready
malts
very
clean
flavour
some
small
bitterness
nice
carbonation
level
quite
a
refreshing
beer
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
back
sorry
for
taking
a
shot
at
american
microbrews
and
im
sure
many
hopheads
will
disagree
but
this
beer
is
at
a
level
of
hop
usage
they
simply
cannot
comprehend
without
a
doubt
my
all
time
favorite
beer
in
the
world
and
only
1
euro
light
bodied
crisp
refreshing
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
nicely
carbonated
a
nice
example
of
a
german
pilsener
really
entertaining
to
see
a
constant
stream
of
bubbles
go
from
the
top
to
bottom
of
my
glass
cant
beat
the
price
or
convenience
aldis
are
all
over
il
but
this
is
spectacularly
average
i
like
noble
pils
better
sometimes
it
is
cheaper
too
the
aldi
grocery
store
chain
carries
this
beer
along
with
heineken
and
corona
lookalikes
this
was
a
quite
pleasant
german
pils
bittburger
immediately
came
to
mind
clean
crisp
malt
flavors
with
a
touch
of
sweet
grain
balanced
by
some
astringency
finish
was
firm
with
the
barest
lingering
hops
bitterness
d
no
complaints
with
the
exception
of
wishing
the
taste
lasted
longer
there
are
much
worse
flaws
i
would
pick
it
up
again
d
nice
balanced
german
pilsener
drinkability
i
would
like
it
a
bit
more
bitter
and
carbonated
to
call
it
a
pils
but
it
somehow
redeemed
itself
at
the
end
d
a
passable
drinker
not
the
best
pilsner
but
it
possesses
nearly
all
of
the
traits
that
i
expect
from
the
style
this
warrants
a
sample
the
flavour
is
mediocre
a
bit
of
spicy
bitterness
which
is
battling
a
vegetal
flavour
the
body
is
a
little
thin
and
too
watery
a
light
unpleasant
aftertaste
lingers
carbonation
is
lower
than
expected
especially
for
such
a
thick
head
drinkable
though
not
fantastic
i
suppose
i
might
drink
it
again
but
probably
not
by
choice
d
i
dont
know
what
it
is
but
try
as
i
might
to
put
this
beer
down
i
just
cant
stop
drinking
it
i
would
later
learn
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
love
of
pure
german
pils
just
as
i
keep
thinking
the
aftertaste
is
awful
and
ill
never
have
another
drink
im
washing
it
away
with
another
swig
if
you
have
an
aldis
in
your
area
you
should
give
this
one
a
try
drinkability
good
price
good
flavor
easy
drinking
an
ok
one
finger
head
that
recedes
to
a
half
island
like
film
of
foam
the
color
is
a
clear
and
briwght
golden
hay
with
some
light
copper
hues
the
aroma
is
strong
with
wet
cut
grassy
hops
the
malts
give
just
a
little
milled
grain
nuance
to
the
aroma
the
taste
is
full
of
those
grassy
german
hops
but
the
water
gives
a
little
gypsum
like
mineral
quality
to
the
kilned
barley
the
gypsm
also
gives
a
crisp
and
dry
feel
to
the
palate
your
standard
german
pilsner
that
easy
to
drink
and
enjoy
en
masse
or
while
working
around
the
house
taste
it
begins
with
a
little
bit
of
a
corn
sweetness
that
finishes
slightly
bitter
but
that
leaves
quickly
the
aftertaste
is
somewhat
of
that
ricepopcorn
taste
a
little
odd
not
bad
but
because
of
the
aftertaste
not
great
ok
so
i
do
not
understand
why
a
beer
like
this
could
have
a
worthy
i
would
drink
any
major
marketing
beer
over
something
like
this
when
i
bought
it
i
was
not
expecting
it
to
be
good
but
this
is
the
beer
that
people
who
drink
coors
would
turn
away
from
just
because
it
is
german
and
has
a
hard
to
pronounce
name
does
not
deem
this
beer
worthy
arguably
the
worst
beer
i
have
ever
had
great
beer
for
the
price
figured
id
try
a
6pack
from
the
local
aldi
not
a
bad
beer
but
since
i
am
not
a
huge
fan
of
hoppy
beers
subtracted
a
little
for
that
still
as
far
as
a
high
hops
beer
goes
i
liked
this
one
and
would
rate
it
among
the
better
high
hops
beers
ive
had
great
beer
and
one
of
the
cheapest
ones
on
sale
here
a
fair
version
of
pilsener
but
try
something
else
first
mhighly
carbonated
overall
a
decent
representation
of
a
german
pilsener
veritable
if
only
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
if
anything
this
one
is
crisp
and
has
a
very
clean
feel
to
it
the
body
is
light
to
medium
and
a
moderate
carbonation
works
well
in
this
one
a
decent
german
pilsener
for
what
it
is
quenching
and
definitely
in
the
running
for
a
session
beer
perhaps
the
most
noticable
flaw
is
how
grainy
it
gets
in
the
aftertaste
as
it
warms
but
its
nothing
major
d
quite
drinkable
no
complaints
low
price
is
a
bonus
besides
its
appearance
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
beer
everything
borders
average
thats
alright
though
for
some
reason
i
wasnt
really
expecting
much
from
this
beer
maybe
from
the
size
it
came
in
or
from
the
cheap
price
either
way
this
bad
boy
will
be
finished
in
no
time
the
mouthfeel
is
actually
pretty
good
and
it
is
very
drinkable
i
bought
this
beer
at
aldi
and
it
was
definitely
worth
the
6
99
for
the
six
pack
i
will
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
six
pack
and
i
might
go
back
to
this
one
from
time
to
time
just
because
of
the
value
congrats
aldi
if
you
can
get
some
of
your
other
german
brands
here
ill
be
visiting
more
often
for
now
youll
get
me
once
a
month
to
pick
up
my
case
or
two
of
wernesgruner
this
is
one
refreshing
beer
the
ultimate
lawn
mower
pilsener
by
that
i
mean
the
costdrinkabiliytaste
ratio
if
you
want
to
invite
some
nonbas
over
for
a
party
but
want
a
solid
german
pils
go
for
this
one
at
5
99
for
a
6
pack
the
numbers
dont
lie
this
is
a
good
deal
wernesgrüner
or
wernesgruener
the
correct
way
to
spell
it
if
you
arent
using
the
ü
was
a
surprisingly
refreshing
treat
on
this
sunny
summer
afternoon
i
was
expecting
this
to
be
yet
another
bastardized
macrolager
fortunately
that
wasnt
the
case
the
fact
that
wernesgrüner
brauerei
has
been
around
for
over
560
years
has
to
tell
you
something
the
fact
that
they
still
make
a
good
quality
product
tells
you
something
even
more
important
drinkability
very
high
although
there
are
better
pilseners
out
there
youd
be
hardpressed
to
find
as
thorough
a
beer
at
its
price
which
is
a
consistent
pleasing
drink
especially
in
warm
summer
months
nice
coup
for
aldi
at
scoring
this
beer
to
stock
this
is
most
definitely
my
favorite
goto
cheap
import
conclusion
i
drank
most
of
this
six
pack
while
cooking
out
on
the
first
hot
day
of
spring
pairing
it
with
freshly
made
german
sausages
and
other
german
fare
and
it
was
great
by
itself
its
a
little
onedimensional
and
the
bitterness
seems
to
overpower
the
mild
flavors
while
this
is
definitely
a
cut
above
the
american
macros
and
many
of
the
larger
imported
lagers
for
the
price
especially
i
picked
this
up
at
aldis
this
is
still
a
swig
it
with
cookout
food
beer
rather
than
a
sipandenjoy
kind
of
brew
overall
unimpressive
for
a
pils
of
any
origin
almost
no
hops
taste
and
with
a
mouthfeel
thats
too
light
ill
pass
on
this
watery
pils
in
the
future
this
is
an
example
of
a
german
classic
german
pilsner
it
is
not
as
bitter
and
malty
as
others
but
has
a
nice
balanced
taste
to
it
very
smooth
with
only
little
hop
aroma
great
lawnmower
beer
crisp
with
decent
head
gold
in
color
interestingly
enough
the
only
places
that
sells
this
beer
around
here
is
aldi
good
for
a
barbque
when
loads
of
halffriends
are
coming
you
know
the
wifes
relatives
and
that
sort
overall
a
good
beer
but
too
typical
to
be
remembered
drinkability
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
really
that
great
either
there
are
definitely
better
pilsners
out
there
d
good
again
low
abv
taste
is
good
and
not
too
weak
feels
good
the
only
thing
slowing
it
down
is
the
damn
metallic
aftertaste
drinkability
lots
of
better
options
im
not
put
off
by
this
but
wont
seek
it
out
like
others
i
picked
this
up
for
5
99
at
aldis
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
beer
is
a
perfecly
clear
strawgolden
color
with
a
thick
lusterous
white
head
that
leaves
nice
trakcs
of
lacing
about
the
glass
the
smell
is
a
combo
of
a
neutral
grain
malt
and
slightly
grassy
spicy
hops
the
flavor
has
a
slight
sweet
fruity
flavor
with
a
mildly
skunked
taste
that
ive
come
to
expect
from
most
euro
lagers
a
decently
balanced
beer
that
finishes
slightly
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
light
to
watery
and
the
carbonation
is
on
the
thin
side
overall
a
drinkable
beer
since
it
is
economical
it
is
probably
worth
the
price
and
just
as
good
or
better
than
bmc
stuff
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
next
to
bitberger
about
my
favorite
normal
german
pils
lammsbrau
organic
german
pilsner
is
the
best
ive
hadbut
this
is
a
close
3rd
and
at
a
dollar
a
bottle
you
cant
beat
it
this
beer
is
a
better
pils
than
many
of
the
american
microbrewed
versions
of
german
pilseners
i
have
tried
very
drinkable
especially
for
the
price
the
mouthfeels
is
excellent
and
drinkability
is
tremendous
if
i
preferred
the
pils
style
this
would
definitely
be
one
of
my
regulars
when
you
are
broke
like
i
was
last
month
give
this
one
a
try
it
isnt
westmalle
by
any
stretch
but
it
sure
as
hell
isnt
heineken
either
drinkability
is
probably
the
highlight
of
this
fine
deutsch
brau
3
to
4
from
a
sixer
is
effortless
and
youll
probably
fight
to
finish
a
sixer
if
you
bring
this
to
a
party
solid
session
lager
in
all
its
glory
for
an
affordable
price
dont
get
me
wrong
i
love
local
micros
those
are
my
passion
but
if
i
can
get
a
well
put
together
import
for
under
a
8
bucks
a
six
than
im
pretty
much
sold
especially
when
standard
sam
adams
are
going
for
9
a
sixer
right
now
and
sam
smiths
are
9
95
a
4
pack
in
my
area
overall
it
is
certainly
drinkable
and
even
sessionable
but
not
a
beer
i
will
seek
out
again
this
is
a
light
bodied
beer
with
a
mild
carbonation
to
it
its
very
easy
to
drink
this
is
a
good
anytime
beer
or
something
that
you
could
eat
with
a
meal
the
flavor
would
enhance
the
flavors
of
the
food
without
being
completely
overpowered
by
the
flavor
of
the
meal
while
its
not
legendary
as
the
label
leads
you
to
believe
its
not
bad
either
and
something
id
have
no
problems
drinking
again
taste
is
light
and
malty
again
with
lagermalt
character
the
yeast
is
clean
and
adds
only
a
taste
which
i
would
call
bottom
fermented
taste
the
typical
sulfur
is
not
in
here
the
hops
whiffs
that
i
picked
up
in
the
smell
are
translated
poorly
into
the
taste
the
beer
has
hoppy
taste
but
is
somewhat
overruled
by
the
light
biscuity
taste
of
the
malt
drinkability
is
good
i
like
this
beer
i
tried
this
beer
on
february
11
2008
after
purchasing
from
the
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
very
grainy
and
not
appealing
at
all
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
the
flavour
is
a
combination
of
malt
and
grain
overall
actually
not
too
bad
deasy
to
drinka
good
session
beer
for
the
money
there
are
better
examples
of
the
style
out
there
but
this
stuff
is
hard
to
beat
at
five
bucks
a
sixpack
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
wonderful
example
of
the
style
overall
impression
considering
the
price
this
is
a
serious
buy
theres
better
german
beer
out
there
but
if
youre
on
a
budget
hit
this
stuff
at
45
a
six
rather
than
the
cheaper
american
pilsner
attempts
d
definitely
better
pils
out
there
not
a
fan
of
the
cabbage
but
still
a
nice
hoppy
crispness
gimme
some
rothaus
pils
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
thinwalled
tall
mug
bright
and
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
full
fizzy
finger
of
foam
that
slowly
fell
to
lighter
lace
aroma
is
skunky
hops
and
light
sweet
grainy
malt
just
like
a
german
pils
should
taste
is
well
balanced
between
grassy
hops
and
earthen
maltiness
finishes
with
a
light
and
clean
aftertaste
mouthfeel
is
smooth
light
to
medium
bodied
with
low
to
medium
levels
of
carbonation
drinkability
is
great
nicely
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
tasty
and
refreshing
example
of
the
style
clear
liquid
clarity
similar
to
apple
juice
but
with
a
distinct
lime
green
hue
seriously
one
finger
offwhite
head
some
retention
and
lacing
low
lazy
carbonation
surpizingly
lasted
throughout
tasting
has
a
bready
smell
yeast
dampness
feintly
floral
dry
and
bitter
pilsener
tastefinishes
quickly
and
a
bit
abrupt
medium
body
with
some
hops
and
a
balance
finishing
more
with
malt
in
the
aftertaste
overall
not
a
bad
tasting
pilsener
but
with
a
bit
too
snappy
a
finish
i
cant
say
i
didnt
enjoy
this
beer
but
i
doubt
ill
run
off
and
bring
some
more
home
nothing
about
it
makes
me
want
to
have
another
right
now
overall
this
one
was
purchased
by
one
of
my
family
members
for
me
to
try
while
on
vacation
it
is
a
nice
refreshing
brew
that
goes
down
nice
and
tastes
pretty
good
i
would
drink
again
d
its
a
pretty
decent
beer
it
tasted
best
at
its
coldest
on
a
hot
day
at
the
price
i
can
see
buying
it
again
when
the
beer
budget
is
being
streched
or
feel
like
something
lighter
one
of
4
beers
i
was
shocked
to
find
at
aldis
of
all
places
this
one
is
certainly
the
best
of
the
bunch
a
fine
lager
in
my
opinion
d
easy
drinking
summer
beer
too
bland
but
still
pleasant
drinkability
diminished
by
blah
mouthfeel
d
easy
drinking
nothing
i
can
spot
as
being
wrong
about
this
but
not
exciting
either
wernesgruner
was
a
light
golden
color
with
good
clarity
the
large
white
head
was
a
little
rocky
and
had
good
retention
leaving
some
thick
lace
on
the
side
of
my
glass
it
smelled
of
noble
hops
and
was
fairly
malty
with
some
earthy
aromas
the
taste
was
noble
hops
over
a
malt
base
with
a
dry
bitter
finish
it
was
medium
bodied
with
good
carbonation
drinkability
was
above
average
its
a
decent
pilsener
and
worth
a
try
d
drinkable
the
subtle
flavours
it
has
are
not
offensive
and
the
lightness
and
lack
of
aftertaste
make
it
easy
to
go
through
a
few
very
refreshing
when
cold
becomes
more
tinny
as
it
warms
picked
this
up
because
it
was
cheap
and
looked
interesting
pours
an
extremely
light
clear
yellow
fair
amount
of
carbonation
comparable
to
a
sprite
or
7up
thick
bright
white
head
which
dissipated
over
a
few
minutes
smell
is
astringent
very
hoppy
with
a
little
sweetness
and
alcohol
taste
is
very
bitter
with
a
hint
of
sweetness
overall
a
strong
astringent
flavor
with
some
hops
as
well
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
with
some
carbonation
drinkability
i
suspect
will
vary
wildly
from
person
to
person
i
could
certainly
see
this
being
an
easy
beer
to
pound
back
for
some
but
not
for
me
overall
its
not
an
offensive
beer
but
its
not
something
i
plan
to
seek
out
in
the
future
as
mentioned
before
in
this
post
75
cents
a
bottle
aint
bad
for
this
its
not
a
classic
its
not
an
astounding
fringe
nutcase
but
it
would
be
an
excellent
fridge
filler
when
you
have
the
macro
drinkers
over
and
dont
want
to
see
them
dump
out
the
great
ones
and
you
dont
want
to
have
to
exorcize
your
fridge
from
the
macrobeer
demons
so
overall
a
very
good
cheap
summer
pils
but
it
does
not
rate
up
there
with
the
classics
very
much
a
lame
duck
when
it
comes
to
german
pilseners
its
cheap
yes
but
so
are
better
beers
thin
beer
thats
easy
enough
to
pound
but
not
one
ill
find
again
classic
beer
from
saxony
rather
hoppy
with
pleasant
bitterness
and
a
bit
tart
aftertaste
wellpronounced
malts
a
small
yeasty
note
pale
sometimes
greenish
color
very
appetizing
aroma
excellent
aperitif
but
not
a
thirstquencher
after
a
second
pint
your
tongue
feels
too
bitter
recommended
i
am
completely
impressed
by
this
beer
an
astonishing
value
with
a
ton
of
character
for
the
price
can
poured
a
light
golden
color
pils
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
with
minimal
retention
aroma
of
faint
grassy
malt
is
a
bit
deceiving
taste
is
weaker
then
expected
with
some
grassyfloral
malt
which
were
enjoyable
but
totally
lack
crispy
hops
which
could
have
made
this
beer
interesting
a
bit
deceiving
since
i
made
sure
to
pick
up
a
can
in
order
to
ensure
freshness
which
totally
seem
to
be
lacking
here
bottle
has
no
date
on
it
poured
into
a
pils
glass
a
very
good
egg
shell
white
head
sits
on
top
of
a
pale
straw
yellow
body
the
head
has
good
staying
power
leaving
lace
down
the
sides
of
the
glass
a
vast
stream
of
bubbles
race
up
to
the
top
sweet
malt
with
just
a
hint
of
floral
hops
in
the
nose
sweet
grainy
malt
predominately
with
barely
a
noticible
hop
bitterness
a
very
thin
body
that
is
rather
bland
almost
no
aftertaste
and
finishes
very
dry
if
you
are
looking
for
a
cheap
beer
this
sure
beats
bmc
and
would
be
a
good
start
for
someone
wanting
to
explore
something
different
wo
going
outside
the
lines
of
the
big
three
slightly
slick
mouthfeel
reinforces
the
sweetness
which
teeters
on
the
edge
of
cloying
drying
hops
make
it
work
and
give
great
burps
hella
better
than
bmc
and
will
continue
to
get
my
4
49
when
i
need
a
cheap
relatively
satisfying
beer
frothy
head
thats
pretty
much
the
highlight
of
this
one
the
smell
was
semiskunk
mixed
with
malt
and
hops
just
like
any
euro
lager
ive
had
better
pilsners
though
the
taste
was
similar
to
the
smell
but
not
so
much
on
the
skunk
it
was
mostly
a
very
malty
taste
with
a
hop
finish
as
well
as
some
very
faint
citrus
fruits
overall
a
disappointment
just
chalk
it
up
as
another
beer
review
i
bought
this
more
out
of
curiousity
than
anything
else
figured
i
would
give
yet
another
german
pils
a
try
overall
i
would
say
that
i
was
mildly
impressed
most
german
beers
are
impressive
this
way
for
the
simple
fact
that
they
are
simple
clean
and
get
right
to
the
point
this
is
no
exception
put
simply
it
looks
smells
and
tastes
good
like
most
pilseners
mouthfeel
is
typical
and
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
nice
refreshing
beer
to
be
enjoyed
pretty
well
any
time
date
code
l236
seems
to
tell
me
it
was
bottled
in
sep05
and
i
got
it
midnovember
not
bad
this
is
an
unexpectedly
taster
pilsner
ill
try
it
again
for
sure
good
stuff
12
ounce
bottle
4
49
a
six
at
aldi
freshness
dating
was
in
code
l1855
drinkability
usually
pils
is
not
really
my
favorite
style
but
this
one
is
not
that
bad
especially
for
its
price
cheaper
than
domestic
beers
for
someone
on
a
budget
it
worths
a
try
i
gotta
admit
when
i
saw
this
on
sale
for
3
49
a
sixer
at
aldis
i
only
bought
it
for
novelty
i
am
surprised
that
its
decent
let
alone
good
canned
sample
light
gold
in
colour
with
lots
of
carbonation
fairly
rich
malty
aroma
from
this
one
with
some
milder
grassy
hop
notes
very
crisp
mouthfeel
with
flavor
notes
of
light
malt
clean
grassy
hops
and
a
very
slight
touch
of
citrus
very
satisfying
indeed
a
good
example
of
the
classic
german
pilsner
style
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
big
fluffy
white
head
decent
lacing
smell
is
sweet
kind
of
a
grainy
malt
smell
honey
little
bit
of
discernible
hops
taste
is
very
sweet
not
very
pleasant
it
tastes
almost
skunked
except
its
in
a
can
honey
sweetness
almost
cloying
no
hops
to
be
found
smooth
carbonation
light
mouthfeel
and
not
pleasant
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
sized
white
head
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
much
carbonation
little
to
no
fizziness
the
smell
is
of
nice
sweet
hops
it
really
doesnt
have
that
skunky
bitter
smell
that
i
notice
in
a
lot
of
german
pilsners
the
taste
is
very
subtle
at
first
almost
like
a
light
beer
there
is
a
hop
bitterness
midway
through
and
the
beer
finishes
with
bready
tastes
the
mouthfeel
is
not
bad
for
the
style
of
beer
and
it
goes
down
pretty
well
overall
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
it
seems
to
lack
any
outstanding
or
unique
qualities
as
a
pils
hound
my
palate
is
over
worked
with
the
expected
bohemianczech
profile
pils
im
beginning
to
be
more
partial
to
the
northern
german
pilsners
this
one
did
not
disappoint
good
biscuity
malt
spine
balanced
with
the
marvelous
blend
of
herbal
german
hop
varieties
one
would
expect
in
a
rich
marzen
i
like
the
mix
this
is
a
very
good
and
well
made
pilsner
fresh
refreshing
slightly
dry
but
with
enormous
taste
pours
a
classic
clear
gold
under
a
two
finger
white
head
with
lovely
contour
great
retention
and
a
nice
network
of
lace
down
the
glass
yup
this
is
what
a
pils
should
look
like
the
nose
is
very
malty
smooth
but
lacking
any
hop
spice
to
balance
the
mouth
is
medium
carbonated
and
slightly
sticky
although
light
in
body
good
smooth
bready
malt
taste
with
a
decent
hop
bitterness
in
the
background
the
hops
are
floral
in
nature
not
at
all
skunky
the
finish
is
more
malt
sweet
than
hops
bitter
while
the
aftertaste
maintains
a
bit
of
both
nice
solid
if
unspectacular
product
its
not
going
to
be
a
problem
splitting
this
six
pack
a
good
german
pils
this
wernesgrüner
die
pils
legende
and
at
aldi
check
it
out
the
beer
is
easy
to
match
with
food
except
something
really
spicy
this
is
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
i
will
consider
keeping
a
six
pack
on
hand
an
enjoyable
nobrainer
never
had
it
and
it
was
3
99
a
6er
why
not
pours
out
a
light
golden
vibrant
carbonation
and
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
smells
of
lightly
sweet
malt
and
grains
with
some
nice
hops
maybe
a
little
straw
flavorwise
alot
like
the
nose
lightly
sweet
raw
tasting
nice
spicy
hops
tingly
bubbles
in
the
mouth
crisp
maybe
a
touch
thin
but
still
very
refreshing
i
like
this
stuff
damn
refreshing
and
at
that
price
one
hell
of
a
bargain
im
hyped
wernesgruner
doesnt
make
me
feel
like
shouting
the
chorus
from
deutschland
uber
alles
from
the
rooftops
but
it
is
a
drinkable
pilsener
that
was
enjoyable
while
it
lasted
i
doubt
that
ill
seek
it
out
again
but
then
very
few
beers
of
this
style
are
accorded
that
honor
comes
out
a
nice
straw
gold
color
with
great
clarity
and
a
small
fluffy
head
that
retains
pretty
well
smells
of
musty
saaz
or
hallertau
hops
very
very
earthy
aroma
taste
is
very
light
with
good
hoppiness
very
similar
to
czech
pilsners
like
urquell
very
little
body
but
the
hops
make
this
beer
extremely
drinkable
this
is
a
very
nice
pils
imho
i
could
drink
gallons
of
the
stuff
overall
i
would
like
to
try
it
on
tap
to
see
if
it
gets
any
better
but
im
not
going
to
spend
my
hard
earned
money
on
any
more
bottles
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
generous
white
head
that
laces
quit
well
especially
for
a
pilsener
aroma
is
primarily
hops
and
a
bit
of
a
sour
yeast
smell
taste
was
hops
and
was
pleasantly
crisp
on
the
finish
but
was
bit
too
carbonated
for
me
it
is
drinkable
but
as
far
as
pilseners
go
there
are
many
other
things
that
i
would
prefer
note
now
in
a
12
oz
brown
bottle
price
at
aldi
just
lowered
to
4
49six
a
good
beer
at
a
great
price
doesnt
taste
as
big
as
it
smells
mild
hops
mildly
bitter
finish
that
lingered
for
a
bit
quite
light
actually
fine
as
a
light
summertime
quaff
i
would
say
easy
but
not
especially
memorable
this
brew
pours
a
light
golden
colour
but
is
murky
the
crown
is
short
but
the
lace
does
stick
around
for
awhile
the
body
is
mediumfull
and
the
taste
is
from
mild
hops
to
which
seem
to
linger
a
short
while
slight
aroma
of
yeast
nothing
exceptional
but
passable
really
they
should
use
the
colour
as
some
marketing
trick
because
beer
pilsner
anyway
should
not
look
like
this
o
this
is
one
of
the
best
perhaps
best
pils
ive
ever
had
it
will
certainly
become
a
benchmark
for
future
reference
a
beautiful
pilsener
seemingly
unable
to
err
wonderful
clean
refreshing
pilsner
havent
found
a
better
pils
to
date
and
each
one
seems
better
than
the
last
pours
a
bright
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
head
of
two
fingers
smell
is
not
strong
but
well
balanced
on
style
with
a
hint
of
lemon
tastes
of
malts
and
noble
hops
which
balance
the
sweetness
it
is
just
delicious
and
goes
down
smoothly
light
to
medium
body
and
light
carbonation
which
makes
for
an
exceptional
drinkability
you
could
down
a
liter
in
less
than
you
say
good
morning
what
a
simple
deliciousness
yet
world
class
beer
up
there
with
weihenstephaner
as
the
best
pilsner
i
have
had
great
pils
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
a
500
ml
can
into
a
pilsner
glass
poured
a
nice
fluffy
and
white
bubbly
head
yellowgold
color
typical
for
this
style
sticky
lace
on
the
glass
a
nice
cream
ring
around
the
edges
smelled
like
citrus
light
spice
peppery
and
some
malted
barley
grains
at
first
it
is
a
bit
sweet
on
my
palate
but
it
finishes
dry
slightly
bitter
and
peppery
there
is
a
little
lemon
zest
in
there
as
well
it
finishes
smooth
and
crisp
balanced
and
light
yet
fulfilling
overall
this
is
a
great
german
pils
it
is
especially
great
for
an
endofsummer
brew
sad
to
see
the
transition
into
fall
081612
on
tap
at
rattle
n
hum
nyc
a
tad
bitter
but
not
a
distraction
full
bodied
bready
on
the
tongue
wsome
herbspice
in
the
aroma
solid
character
but
a
bit
weighty
for
a
session
definitely
worth
a
place
at
the
table
a
light
but
hop
forward
german
pils
for
a
pilsner
you
cant
get
much
better
than
this
full
bodied
mouth
feel
touch
of
cream
but
crisp
clean
finish
dont
have
to
wait
for
a
hot
day
to
drink
solid
on
its
own
but
great
with
food
very
good
pils
theres
been
a
new
push
towards
session
beers
but
pils
has
always
been
the
original
great
hoppy
session
beer
87100
sam
its
usually
priced
well
too
for
the
budget
conscious
consumer
enjoy
o
a
good
example
of
the
style
the
best
widely
available
german
pilsner
the
real
deal
great
with
some
burgers
off
the
grill
or
some
charcuterie
and
fromage
i
wish
they
would
bring
in
kegs
so
we
could
drink
it
on
tap
unfortunately
for
the
most
part
us
craft
brewers
feel
the
need
for
too
many
hops
or
too
much
malt
to
make
a
classic
session
style
german
pilsner
i
consider
an
excellent
pils
like
this
a
highly
underated
beer
in
a
land
flowing
with
mediocre
to
horrible
lagers
and
overpriced
over
abvd
microbrews
this
is
the
beer
you
need
when
you
want
a
beer
that
goes
right
down
the
middle
in
excellent
form
overall
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
will
keep
a
six
pack
of
this
on
hand
for
guests
or
on
hot
days
for
myself
i
would
assume
that
as
far
as
pilsners
available
in
the
us
this
would
be
a
top
one
o
the
best
example
of
an
available
imported
german
pilsner
anywhere
in
north
america
the
only
german
pilsners
that
would
be
as
good
imho
are
from
sw
germany
and
generally
cannot
be
found
here
so
prost
kamerad
o
i
love
pilseners
and
i
love
konig
there
isnt
a
thing
wrong
with
this
brew
and
its
one
ill
be
going
back
to

id
like
it
a
lot
more
if
it
werent
quite
so
skunky
and
simplistic
even
by
pils
standards
still
a
worthy
offering
awesome
beer
o
my
german
friends
will
call
this
a
macro
to
them
but
its
hardly
fair
to
stand
this
up
against
any
u
s
macro
this
is
a
terrific

that
doesnt
disappoint
a
fine

beneath
a

of
straightforward
pilsner
malt
and
soft
smooth
noble

its
subtly
floral
with
a
hint
of
lemongrass
in
its
mainly
grassy
character
although
the
bitterness
is
there
from
the
beginning
it
doesnt
really
make
itself
known
until
midway
and
then
it
bows
out
simply
stepping
aside
to
make
up
the
background
of
the
finish
its
quite
nicely
rounded
and
polished
to
the
point
of
being
remarkably
drinkable
absolutely
worth
trying
particularly
if
you
can
find
it
on

konig
pilsener
was
my
introduction
to
the
world
of
real
pilsner
beers
i
gathered
with
friends
and
enjoyed
many
wonderful
nights
at
5050s
in
erlangen
germany
where
it
always
had
konig
pilsener
on
tap
it
has
a
strong
pilsener
smell
and
bitter
taste
there
is
a
very
nice
head
coming
off
the
tap
very
easy
to
drink
good
color
ive
tried
bottles
a
couple
times
and
it
is
still
good
but
not
the
same
enjoy
half
litre
brown
long
neck
bottle
stange
glass
i
liked
it
really
enjoyable
and
a
classic
sample
pours
a
brilliantly
clear
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
very
high
apparent
carbonation
aroma
is
very
clean
with
mild
noble
hop
aroma
and
slight
sulfur
taste
is
very
clean
hop
bitterness
right
up
front
that
lingers
nicely
fading
to
a
crisp
dry
finish
high
carbonation
very
smooth
overall
this
is
a
classic
example
of
a
german
pilsner
hoppy
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
summer
beer
will
definitely
have
again

overall
this
beer
is
pretty
much
what
i
expect
from
a
pilsner
though
i
would
prefer
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
its
worth
a
try
but
there
are
other
pilsners
out
there
that
i
would
drink
first
prost
lampertland
overall
this
is
a
great
german
pilsener
one
that
takes
malts
and
hops
and
balances
them
nicely
much
better
than
other
pilsener
style
beers
out
there
and
certainly
a
nice
beer
when
one
is
searching
for
something
a
little
less
insane
in
the
malthop
department
this
can
is
fresh
enough
b
b
d

so
either
my
memory
of
this
beers
excellent
hopforward
quality
is
off
and
i
had
mistakenlyremember
krombacher
for
this
or
the
recipe
or
hop
regimen
used
has
been
mellowed
or
maybe
the
hops
were
just
flacidinthealphaacids
in
this
batch
who
really
knows
jever
this
is
not
at
any
rate
and
its
still
a
slightly
better
than
average
beer
for
its
style
now
go
getcha
some
a
refreshing
german
beer
poured
to
a
classic
golden
straw
hue
with
perfect
clarity
head
developed
to
a
frothy
white
which
laced
and
lasted
aroma
was
of
hop
malt
and
grass
taste
was
of
malt
with
hints
of
hop
and
grain
nice
full
mouthfeel
with
a
clean
aftertaste
overall
the
rock
of
gibraltar
of
pilsener
beers
smooth
tasty
classic
pilsener
taste
beautiful
light
gold
color
refreshing
just
drink
it
quickly
dont
linger
over
it
o
this
was
a
great
beer
and
very
nice
for
the
style
perfect
for
the
patio
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
had
all
of
the
qualities
i
enjoy
in
a
good
pils
and
it
made
for
an
enjoyable
experience
i
wish
this
beer
was
more
easily
obtainable
one
of
the
best
german
pils
brought
into
the
u
s
both
on
draft
and
when
fresh
in
bottles
pours
strawgolden
with
virtually
no
haze
into
my
0
5l
mug
glorious
carbonation
and
good
size
and
retention
of
contrasting
white
head
nose
is
clean
light
lemony
with
a
whiff
of
herbal
elements
palate
has
a
great
combination
of
rather
clean
malty
flavors
and
delightful
herbal
hoppy
flavors
to
balance
things
nicely
no
skunk
zero
finish
is
more
of
the
herbal
hops
incredibly
easy
drinking
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
as
far
as
what
we
have
for
options
here
in
the
u
s
its
a
very
fine
german
pilsner
o
a
solid
pilsner
that
certainly
has
its
sweet
spot
in
the
finish
the
price
is
right
there
with
most
other
german
imports
worth
a
pick
up
for
fans
of
the
style
this
beer
stands
out
in
that
it
does
not
have
the
sticky
sweet
or
metallic
taste
that
accompanies
too
many
pileners
pours
a
transparent
straw
color
with
perfect
clarity
topped
by
only
the
faintest
whisp
of
a
white
head
aroma
is
mild
and
primarily
skunky
with
a
very
vague
sweetness
and
hop
essence
the
flavor
is
similar
to
the
nosefaint
and
unappealing
this
tastes
like
beer
in
the
most
generic
sense
of
the
term
theres
a
mild
honeyed
malt
flavor
on
the
front
end
and
some
hop
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
those
are
the
closest
things
to
defined
flavors
i
can
discern
the
rest
is
just
a
wash
of
what
i
would
normally
associate
with
a
light
beer
yet
another
pilsner
that
leaves
me
scratching
my
head
as
to
the
merits
of
the
style
food
match
for
some
reason
perhaps
the
lemon
taste
in
this
brew
seafood
really
feels
the
best
option
o
ive
had
better
imported
pilseners
but
this
is
worthy
to
try
again
in
the
warmer
weather
this
could
really
hit
the
spot
rjt
overall
a
really
nice
pilsener
it
pours
a
clear
yellowish
amber
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
aroma
has
that
classic
pilsner
scent
the
texture
is
decent
with
an
ok
flavor
this
is
a
fairly
weaker
in
taste
than
most
german
pilsners
the
use
of
malts
and
hops
are
very
difficult
to
find
in
the
flavor
as
there
seems
to
be
more
of
a
raw
grainy
taste
drinks
smooth
and
easy
however
there
are
better
german
made
pilsners
on
the
market
spicy
noble
hops
up
front
along
with
sweet
pale
malts
grassy
wheaty
slight
caramel
lemony
touch
of
black
pepper
crisp
refreshing
and
dry
finish
o
this
is
better
than
the
last
one
i
reviewed
which
was
in
a
bottle
i
think
the
other
one
i
had
5
years
ago
might
have
been
a
little
out
of
whack
this
time
its
more
like
a
german
pilsener
should
be
price
point

9
oz

a
decent
slightly

but
nothing
extraordinary
o
disappointed
in
this
brew
definitely
not
a
bad
pilsner
just
runs
on
the
light
side
of
what
i
enjoy
overall
i
think
i
would
only
have
this
at
a
party
where
pilsners
were
served
a
classic
golden
pilsner
with
about
1
finger
of
head
that
settles
quickly
with
a
nice
lacing
a
distinct
aroma
of
grains
with
a
slight
hint
of
citrus
this
is
a
very
good
tasting
beer
for
the
style
i
taste
perfectly
malted
grains
none
of
the
skunk
that
i
normally
get
with
the
mass
market
german
or
dutch
lagers
probably
the
best
of
the
german
pilsners
ive
tried
i
really
appreciate
the
creamy
texture
which
is
rare
for
a
pilsner
style
this
is
my
new
go
to
pilsner
i
wish
that
id
found
it
sooner
outside
of
the
smell
this
is
a
world
class
pils
very
authentic
not
the
greatest
but
certainly
up
there
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
12
inch
fizzy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
an
oily
film
on
top
of
the
beer
small
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
grass
and
some
grapelike
fruity
aromas
taste
is
of
grain
grape
juice
grape
jelly
and
a
grassy
and
herbal
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
bitterness
that
sits
right
on
top
of
the
tongue
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pilsener
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
overall
tasty
and
very
refreshing
a
real
authentic
pilsner
extremely
quaffable
id
be
glad
to
have
this
again
pours
a
toasted
straw
with
loose
white
foam
and
lots
of
bubbles
in
the
glass
dirty
glass
anywho
the
effect
is
pretty
smells
of
sweet
grain
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
classic
and
pleasant
lovely
pils
with
good
grain
and
sweet
corn
hints
followed
with
a
bit
of
bitter
subtlety
thin
with
moderate
carb
and
a
semi
dry
finish
good
beer
o
although
not
a
huge
fan
of
german
lagers
this
is
really
nice
and
well
put
together
really
looking
forward
to
working
out
in
the
yard
this
spring
with
a
few
dozen
of
these
o
a
beer
made
to
be
drinkable
quite
light
body
with
a
nice
mild
bitterness
germans
do
simple
beer
very
well
this
beer
is
in
a
word
clear
while
all
the
flavors
were
mild
they
were
very
distinct
i
wish
i
had
more
descriptors
to
use
but
i
couldnt
really
pin
anything
down
with
a
good
comparison
there
was
nothing
clouding
these
distinct
flavors
they
came
through
clear
as
a
bell
while
i
like
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
still
think
there
is
a
little
something
lacking
perhaps
i
had
it
too
cold
i
dont
know
a
great
pilsener
none
the
less
o
overall
decently
flavourful
with
some
subtle
notes
showing
up
and
a
bit
of
complexity
not
that
refreshing
or
very
well
balanced
though
and
im
again
blaming
that
metallic
bitterness
for
this
i
love
this
beer
and
im
not
just
saying
that
because
it
was
being
sold
at
my
local
grocer
in
500ml
can
fourpacks
thats
two
liters
of
actual
european
pilsner
beer
people
for
the
princely
sum
of
4
57
let
me
try
to
explain
why
this
beer
rocks
it
rocks
because
it
has
something
other
lesser
beers
typically
lack
it
has
staying
power
by
that
i
mean
it
goes
down
extremely
well
on
the
first
luscious
gulp
but
continues
to
go
down
just
like
that
throughout
the
whole
halfliter
can
very
few
beers
manage
to
achieve
that
and
for
me
it
has
one
of
the
best
combinations
of
taste
and
refrenshingness
if
i
can
coin
a
term
that
i
have
ever
experienced
in
a
pilsner
so
to
summarize
go
out
and
get
this
beer
and
see
for
yourself
if
it
isnt
really
pleasing
im
pretty
confident
youll
agree
this
is
a
classic
the
flavors
are
everything
i
look
for
in
german
pils
and
the
drinkability
if
very
nice
price
is
excellent
for
an
import
really
just
hard
to
beat
the
value
of
this
beer
i
recommend
buying
the
cans
though
or
on
draft
as
bottles
are
usually
skunked
even
with
the
brown
glass
pours
pale
straw
yellow
with
a
finger
and
a
half
thick
white
cloud
of
a
head
which
dissipates
to
a
foam
ring
with
fine
layered
lacing
few
carbonation
bubbles
can
be
seen
flowing
up
the
whole
time
youre
drinking
this
one
smell
is
to
the
herbalcitrusy
end
on
the
hops
with
biscuitycorny
malts
bitter
lemon
and
maybe
a
little

along

you

em
one
of
these
and
wait
for
them
to

where
they
can

of

and
a

this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a

of

foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
grass
and
light
flowers
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
though
the
wheat
is
definitely
the
star
here
the
flowers
relegated
to
the
background

the
body
is
fairly
light
with

overall
a
good
solid
pils
nuff
said
o
decent
pils
and
i
am
glad
i
tried
it
i
do
not
need
to
have
another
though
i
brought
a
500ml
can
of
konig
pilsner
home
from
a
recent
trip
to
europe
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
dissapates
quickly
in
the
aroma
is
typical
of
most
pilsners
saaz

a
small
dry
to
clean
aftertaste
and
decent
carbonation
overall
its
typical
but
drinkable
i
thought
it
was
a
good
representation
of
this
classic
beer
style
overall
drinkability
possibly
the
worst
german
pilsner
ive
had
maybe
its
just
a
bad
bottle
but
without
a
date
theres
no
way
i
can
tell
o
easily
the
best
green
bottle
pilsner
ive
had
yet
lovely
presenting
beer
perfect
pale
gold
creamy
head
noble
hoppy
nose
with
hints
of
bitterness
yes
on
the
nose
and
mild
grassiness
assertive
bitterness
on
the
palate
but
herbal
spicy
hopiness
and
clean
background
pilsner
malt
the
beer
was
somewhat
softer
on
tap
whereas
the
bottled
version
seems
more
robust
maybe
just
not
as
fresh
either
way
supremely
drinkable
while
a
few
steps
off
the
best
pilsners
out
there
it
really
is
a
great
beer
overall
i
really
like
this
beer
im
keeping
the
can
o
overall
i
enjoyed
this
one
subtle
and
simple
but
flavorful
and
refreshing
at
the
same
time
just
a
hair
sweeter
than
i
like
in
the
flavor
but
great
on
the
whole
with
very
nice
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
in
the
finish
overall
spot
on
classic
pilsner
in
my
book
the
earthy
hops
arent
to
my
tastes
but
work
well
here
and
are
true
to
style
would
work
better
with
a
meal
than
on
its
own
overall
good
mix
of
dry
crispness
maltbaked
white
bread
and
hop
bitter
very
solid
flavor
is
similar
good
blend
of
sweet
malt
while
hop
bitterness
hits
the
sides
of
the
tongue
finish
is
super
clean
grain
lingers
for
a
nice
time
really
nice
pilsener
pale
gold
and
crystal
clear
modest
white
head
about
one
finger
that
becomes
a
thin
film
and
then
a
ring
lacing
is
minor
perhaps
due
to
glass
washed
in
the
dishwasher
aroma
is
grainy
with
a
spot
of
flowery
hops
taste
is
very
clean
malts
with
some
moderately
bitter
euro
hops
mouthfeel
is
good
with
medium
carbonation
it
has
a
mildly
dry
bitter
finish
a
perfect
easy
drinking
summer
pils
o
i
like
a
good
german
pilsener
and
this
certainly
is
one
all
i
can
really
say
in
criticism
is
that
the
mouthfeel
detracts
from
this
otherwise
fantasic
beer
i
would
definitely
down
a
few
of
these
in
the
hot
australian
summer
and
not
feel
guilty
about
it
one
bit
notes
light
in
body
yet
very
balanced
this
pils
is
one
of
the
cleanest
beers
i
have
ever
tasted
at
the
price
its
one
of
the
best
pilseners
for
the
money
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
may
be
a
new
summer
standard
overall
a
solid
pils
i
have
been
really
into
german
lagers
lately
so
far
i
think
my
fav
is
spaten
optimator
an
overall
delicious
europeangerman
pilsener
that
is
great
to
find
a
regular
go
to
beer
that
wont
set
you
back
on
price
either
and
totally
enjoyable
all
the
way
through
o
this
is
a
pretty
average
lager
it
reminds
me
of
wernesgruner
pils
i
would
place
the
more
common
becks
as
better
than
this
beer
quite
good
worth
trying
overal
a
solid
pils
one
of
the
better
that
i
have
had
but
still
a
pils
spot
on
as
far
as
texture
and
consistency
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pilsener
that
i
would
return
to
with
pleasure
a
great
example
and
representation
of
this
style
also
a
good
case
study
in
keeping
a
german
pils
fresh
from
brewery
to
consumer
after
enduring
a
slow
start
this
pils
turns
out
to
be
an
adequately
quaffable
example
of
the
style
if
a
bit
staid
and
underwhelming
in
the
effort
tastes
like
a
pilsener
should
clean
easy
drinking
and
fresh
perfect
on
a
warm
day
with
some
barbeque
and
friends
simple
and
smooth
delicate
with
soft
grainy
pils
malt
and
grassy
bitterness
perhaps
as
lightly
colored
as
nonadjunct
beer
can
get
pale
straw
and
clear
filtered
with
a
white
head
that
hits
the
mark
more
grass
lemon
black
pepper
from
the
hops
super
dry
and
refreshing
a
fantastically
subtle
beer
i
can
only
imagine
what
a
treat
this
would
be
close
to
the
source
notes
lots
of
flavor
but
the
flavors
are
out
of
balance
good
on
them
for
trying
though
its
not
a
weak
beer
by
any
means
cheers
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
color
with
a
white

the
aroma
or
lack
there
of
a
faint
sweet

the

nothing
exciting
pretty
good
eurogerman
pilsner
good
beer
for
everyday
drinking
during
summertime
while
not
superexciting
im
hard
pressed
to
find
fault
with
this
beer
either
a
clean
supremely
easydrinking
example
of
the
style
great
on
a
warm
evening
clear
bubbly
straw
colored

white

no

is
kinda
malty
and
crisp

not

pronounced

a
bit
of
hops
and
some
biscuity
breads
light
crisp
carbonated
feel
drinkability
is
good
its
refreshing
and
not
a
bad
german
pils
in
the
end
well
balanced
although
the
hops
come
in
a
touch
late
the
malt
profile
is
sweet
but
pleasantly
unrefined
with
a
coarse
dough
and
bread
note
hops
are
tinged
with
citrus
and
spice
and
represent
the
style
well
mouthfeel
is
thin
at
times
but
not
too
detrimental
this
is
extremely
drinkable
overall
and
is
worth
picking
up
if
you
enjoy
the
style
in
the
slightest
drinkability
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
but
not
the
best
example
of
its
style
i
would
drink
this
again
but
would
not
be
my
first
choice
d
considering
the
prize
this
is
a
nice
german
pilsener
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
blue
green
highlights
likely
from
the
glass
smell
is
of
light
sulfur
and
fresh

dough
taste
is
light
crackery
malts
up

with
a
hint
of

followed
by
a

middle
and

spicy
floral
hop
finish
good
bitterness
levels
mouthfeel
is
average
slightly
high
carbonation
very
good
drinkability
light
and
refreshing
but
still
packed
with
some
flavor
light
and
refreshing
eminently
drinkable
this
is
extraordinary
swill
beer
happiness
if
i
was
a
benevolent
socialist
dictator
i
would
heavily
subsidize
this
style
of
beer
so
that
my
common
masses
would
not
have
to
succumb
to
the
usual
american
macro
suspects
i
like
this
brew
i
like
the
style
as
well

one
you

could
go

with
its
just
so
balanced
and
so
beautiful
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
have
ever
had
the
privilege
to
try
i
use
to
be
someone
who
didnt
understand
that
lagers
could
too
be
so
supreme
as
a
good
ale
but
as
i
learned
more
of
beer
and
found
beers
like
this
i
learned
just
what
a
great
pilsner
could
be
world
class
beer
and
one
that
is
perfection
in
its
style
d
very
drinkable
good
representation
of
the
style
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
a
very
drinkable
pils
i
could
see
myself
having
several
of
these
in
a
sitting
d
the
beer
is
very
light
and
refreshing
i
could
easily
drink
several
of
these
in
a
single
sitting
a
prototypical
german
pilsner
nothing
too
outstanding
on
any
level
but
the
metallic
finish
is
a
bit
of
a
turnoff
i
realize
i
may
be
drinking
this
past
its
prime
but
am
doubtful
it
has
much
more
to
offer
when
fresh
i
mean
woody
allen
gave
it
an
a
just
read
below
i
think
he
was
in
the
orgasmatron
at
the
time
my
glugging
pour
following
a
loud
crack
produced
a
finger
of
fluffy
bonewhite
head
floating
atop
the
beer
like
clouds
drifting
overhead
color
was
a
pale
lemonyellow
color
with
neplus
clarity
that
would
make
any
bmc
drinker
weep
for
this
level
of
clarity
no
boostin
nose
was
saaz
hops
to
the
max
ger
pilsener
not
by
my
reckoning
bohemianczech
pils
more
like
i
could
weep
for
what
prohibition
resulted
in
for
us
aals
are
the
worst
mouthfeel
was
silky
with
a
big
soft
hops
flavor
like
spearmint
on
the
tongue
shazam
but
this
was
fantastic
i
got
some
maltiness
but
hops
were
king
here
finish
was
literally
breathtaking
if
you
have
ever
smoked
a
menthol
cigarette
you
will
understand
this
was
clean
minty
slightly
malty
but
very
dry
wow
finish
lingered
with
a
minty
hoppiness
there
was
no
question
that
this
was
hopdriven
but
i
wonder
how
well
they
would
have
held
up
in
a
bottle
this
is
one
instance
where
i
can
encourage
canphobic
drinkers
to
give
a
king
a
chance
i
am
pushing
things
around
in
my
cooler
to
make
room
even
as
we
speak
see
you
on
the
beach
poured
into
my
zatec
fluted
glass
straw
colored
with
a
rapidly
fading
2
fingers
of
white
head
a
note
of
spiciness
on
the
nose
but
only
just
a
harbinger
of
doom
very
very
watery
oh
wait
the
head
is
now
completely
gone
after
one
minute
a
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
for
maybe
15
seconds
not
much
going
on
at
all
very
light
for
style
maybe
my
least
favorite
german
pils
ive
had
perhaps
the
beer
the
american
adjuncts
were
modeled
after
drink
a
decent
pilsner
for
sure
but
there
better
options
in
the
category
drinkability
oh
yes
the
330ml
bottle
was
just
too
little
for
me
felt
more
like
a
sampler
i
would
definitely
drink
it
again
d
its
good
but
not
a
stand
out
pilsner
for
me
draft
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
served
in
a
0
5
liter
pilsner
glass
golden
and
perfectly
clear
topped
by
two
inches
of
sudsy
white
foam
that
recedes
to
a
collar
in
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
clean
and
bright
pilsner
malt
dominant
over
the
subtle
noble
hop
aroma
its
simple
but
clean
crisp
and
crackery
on
the
tongue
with
a
firm
bitterness
this
is
faintly
mineral
and
faintly
hoppy
clean
and
perfectly
enjoyable
but
it
doesnt
particularly
stand
out
amongst
german
pilsners
it
finishes
with
a
firm
bitterness
thats
herbal
in
character
i
enjoyed
my
glass
but
ive
had
a
few
better
pilsners
recently
all
around
a
top
example
of
the
style
as
its
made
könig
one
of
my
standard
german
pilsners
the
color
of
urine
with
a
nice
gentle
fizz
and
a
nice
head
nose
if
of
straw
like
hops
and
apples
bitterness
blends
to
be
a
nice
floral
pollen
that
is
very
subdued
this
is
a
sharper
pilsner
but
not
heavy
at
all
very
nice
malt
and
with
the
style
if
you
maintain
a
brisk
quality
its
pretty
consistent
still
had
better
but
a
nice
surprise
humdrum
doesnt
imply
bad
it
implies
boring
and
forgettable
german
brewing
culture
says
theres
nothing
wrong
with
being
ordinary
and
conventional
if
anything
it
encourages
it
but
it
does
insists
you
do
it
well
königs
made
the
first
right
move
by
sticking
to
the
reinheitsgebot
but
now
theyve
got
to
up
the
gerstenmalz
and
hopfen
a
little
mild
flavor
a
little
bitter
at
the
back
pilsner
malt
in
the
front
its
easy
drinking
and
mild
not
much
to
say
its
worth
a
dollar
not
much
else
drinkability
tastes
too
much
like
euro
lager
for
my
palate
to
get
much
enjoyment
out
of
this
pours
a
nice
golden
color
that
is
clear
and
crisp
with
a
one
and
a
half
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
skim
with
some
decent
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
some
citrus
notes
with
a
grass
like
backbone
the
taste
is
crisp
of
a
pilsner
malt
backbone
with
a
grassy
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
low
to
moderate
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
with
a
nice
crisp
taste
and
finish
this
beer
is
a
little
too
light
for
my
taste
it
was
very
refreshing
after
a
hot
afternoon
of
honeydo
yard
work
i
do
not
drink
a
lot
of
pilsners
but
this
is
the
best
pilsner
that
i
have
had
to
date
the
bottled
version
is
a
bit
drier
than
i
seem
to
think
the
can
and
tap
versions
are
but
that
might
be
my
memory
going
funny
again
they
are
all
4
9
abv
so
most
likely
are
the
one
and
the
same
before
being
put
into
the
container
overall
this
is
one
of
the
cleanest
lagers
ive
had
to
date
and
one
of
the
better
german
pilsners
ive
had
as
well
i
think
without
this
last
pilsner
run
ive
been
doing
the
past
few
weeks
i
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
appreciate
this
beer
as
much
as
i
did
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
youre
into
pilsners
d
this
would
make
a
good
lawn
mowing
beer
very
light
crisp
and
refreshing
but
id
likely
want
to
move
on
to
something
with
a
bit
more
substance
very
light
golden
our
with
a
rich
white
head
floral
grassy
aroma
with
a
citrusy
backdrop
taste
is
light
with
an
earthy
grainy
start
and
an
eventual
lemony
kick
before
some
nice
bitter
hops
take
over
remarkably
wellrounded
brew
definitely
one
of
the
better
pils
that
i
have
had
and
easily
the
best
i
have
had
in
a
can
but
still
behind
my
favorite
prima
pils
if
you
see
it
on
tap
go
for
it
a
very
very
good
pilsner
in
my
book
d
i
found
this
beer
to
be
very
drinkable
and
quite
refreshing
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
tried
while
not
the
best
it
is
definitely
a
great
example
of
what
a
pilsner
should
be
obviously
underrated
as
ive
never
even
heard
of
this
one
i
would
buy
it
again
i
had
this
on
tap
at
kendalls
brassiere
in
downtown
los
angeles
california
the
i
spy
beer
does
not
allow
for
restaurants
all
around
a
solid
pilsener
and
german
beer
in
general
might
not
be
the
best
but
runs
close
far
better
than
the
average
massproduced
swill
the
mouthfeel
is
excellent
crisp
and
bubbly
carbonation
mixes
with
a
nice
soft
and
smooth
body
very
pleasing
and
quite
easily
drinkable
yes
ive
had
better
pilsners
but
this
one
is
solid
and
underrated
if
you
ask
me
i
saw
it
at
a
bar
for
2
a
can
because
they
couldnt
sell
any
good
luck
for
me
because
this
is
a
solid
brew
taste
is
lots
of
grainy
malts
with
a
bit
of
a
husky
flavor
hopping
is
pretty
mild
with
most
of
the
contributions
coming
in
the
form
of
a
light
bittering
finish
not
the
cleanest
pilsener
out
there
but
packs
quite
a
bit
of
flavor
compared
to
many
german
pilseners
good
beer
that
can
disappear
fast
from
the
fridge
if
not
careful
its
a
great
pilsener
maybe
better
out
of
the
can
too
which
is
rare
d
this
beer
pretty
much
packs
everything
i
look
for
in
this
style
its
light
balanced
and
easy
drinking
it
has
just
enough
complexity
to
keep
me
going
back
to
my
glass
and
the
low
abv
makes
me
wish
i
had
more
on
hand
this
has
to
be
one
of
the
most
potently
flavored
pilsners
around
overall
this
isnt
that
bad
of
a
pilsner
is
very
drinkable
and
id
drink
again
if
given
the
chance
it
truly
tastes
like
i
thought
it
would
no
surprise
and
no
great
find
an
enjoyable
pilsener
and
i
would
probably
get
it
again
if
there
was
no
other
choices
worth
trying
not
that
great
of
a
beer
carbonation
is
there
but
its
a
bit
flat
either
on
tap
at
huettenbar
in
chicago
or
from
a
can
off
color
metallic
flavors
are
up
front
in
this
beer
you
really
have
to
keep
chugging
it
to
avoid
the
emergence
of
a
straw
flavored
skunky
aftertaste
i
cant
see
how
anyone
would
rave
about
this
or
give
it
more
than
a
c
its
german
but
it
has
that
crappy
stale
dutch
beer
flavor
of
heineken
or
amstel
many
better
german
beers
are
available

poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
it
produces
a
1
inch
head
that
leaves
slight
lacing
the
appearance
is
golden
and
clear
the
aroma
is
of

and
slight
malt
the
taste
is
dry
and
slightly
bitter
with
some
maltiness
the
feel
is
smooth
and
the
finish
clean
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
pilsner
d
too
salty
to
drink
several
but
i
liked
the
cask
of
this
beer
i
bought
mouthfeel
is
snappy
with
the
hops
softening
with
some
fizz
decent
drinker
the
dryness
actually
takes
a
bit
out
is
a
little
challenging
on
the
tongue
for
such
a
tight
little
beer
not
bad
d
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
light
and
refreshing
with
a
good
taste
thats
worth
a
try
sometime
drinkability
more
than
solid
example
of
a
light
dry
german
pils
while
not
as
bitter
as
some
although
still
quite
dry
it
is
very
well
balanced
and
i
could
see
drinking
a
decent
amount
of
this
if
available
dan
excellent
german
pilsner
could
pair
nicely
with
a
turkey
dinner
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
leaves
some
lacing
aroma
of
grassy
hops
with
some
malt
taste
is
again
grassy
hops
with
a
bready
flavor
and
a
bit
of
honey
thin
body
with
a
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
pretty
solid
german
pilsner
that
is
very
drinkable
ill
definitely
try
this
again
next
summer
body
is
slightly
watery
but
at
least
the
carbonation
is
not
extreme
if
you
like
a
good
lager
this
one
is
pretty
good
would
be
perfect
on
a
hot
day
overall
there
was
nothing
here
that
really
blew
me
away
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
really
no
weaknesses
here
worth
a
shot
a
budget
beer
definitely
above
the
average
some
odd
flavours
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
mouthfeeldrinkability
slick
and
easy
with
a
rolling
effervescence
that
remains
just
inside
the
radar
this
is
a
very
basic
yet
solid
german
pilsener
just
not
as
complex
or
interesting
as
other
big
names
out
there
pours
a
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
nice
fluffy
white
head
very
active
beer
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
glass
a
crisp
clean
malt
and
noble
hop
aroma
is
coming
off
this
beer
a
very
nice
pilsner
aroma
there
is
an
excellent
hop
flavor
that
is
balanced
very
well
with
the
malts
its
a
simple
beer
but
very
flavorful
with
a
nice
floral
quality
from
the
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
just
about
right
nice
and
light
and
the
carbonation
helps
fill
it
out
a
clean
dry
finish
that
really
makes
you
go
back
for
more
this
is
as
drinkable
as
it
gets
a
nice
aroma
clean
crisp
flavor
and
a
finish
that
makes
you
want
to
take
another
sip
a
brilliiantly
clear
light
straw
colored
beer
with
minimal
head
aroma
is
a
husky
grainy
citrusy
and
toasty
this
pils
tastes
clean
and
perfect
nothing
extreme
but
superbly
balanced
with
the
decoctionmalty
backbone
against
a
slightly
skunky
hop
backround
a
touch
of
malt
sweetness
lingers
and
then
is
cut
off
by
a
hop
bite
to
finish
nice
and
dry
the
medium
body
and
strong
carbonation
join
together
to
make
this
beer
supremely
drinkable
this
beer
is
darn
tasty
and
quite
a
value
for
me
at
about
21
bucks
a
case
any
pilsner
fan
should
pick
this
one
up
d
an
excellent
pils
one
i
will
revisit
often
recommended
one
of
the
better
german
pils
and
better
than
the
well
advertised
competition
i
measure
pils
by
prima
and
this
one
isnt
that
good
but
its
still
a
nice
light
tasty
pils
priced
right
nice
for
the
pool
or
beach
given
you
can
get
in
in
the
can
i
just
hate
a
brew
that
cant
maintain
its
head
and
this
one
does
that
too
tastes
pretty
good
lame
head
but
worth
a
try
d
all
day
long
i
really
enjoyed
this
beer
d
i
have
had
better
pilsners
this
seems
relatively
weak
in
taste
and
body
also
the
overly
perfumy
aftertaste
is
a
bit
of
a
put
off
light
bodied
with
low
carbonation
goes
down
pretty
easy
though
i
think
i
would
have
liked
a
little
bit
more
fizz
it
was
the
only
beer
available
at
a
wine
bar
we
visited
in
berlin
good
color
and
good
clean
flavor
overall
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
certainly
better
than
becks
and
not
too
disappointing
when
its
the
only
choice
i
would
recommend
this
in
general
pretty
decent
appearance
of
course
pilsners
dont
really
produce
anything
all
too
interesting
nose
is
pretty
simple
but
not
empty
really
distinctive
flavor
the
floral
tone
really
adds
some
uniqueness
nice
balance
with
the
malt
and
yeast
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
quaff
12oz
bottle
pours
clear
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
cap
that
lasts
pleasant
bouquet
of
grainy
malt
and
soft
grassy
hops
the
taste
is
a
bit
fainter
with
the
malt
character
much
weaker
though
the
grassiness
is
all
but
lost
the
hop
bitterness
comes
through
and
makes
it
quite
dry
lightmedium
body
with
medium
carbonation
a
decent
pils
konig
pilsner
poured
a
very
pale
gold
with
a
nice
white
head
and
very
good
lacing
the
smell
was
faint
with
hints
of
hops
the
taste
was
a
nice
sweet
malt
with
a
good
hop
back
mouthfeel
was
good
and
this
beer
show
very
good
drinkability
over
all
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
nice
pilsner
good
summer
beer
easy
drink
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
this
beer
to
be
so
good
for
so
little
ill
have
to
have
some
people
over
to
finish
it
off
before
it
goes
flatstale
in
the
fridge
this
is
a
beer
i
could
go
for
any
day
its
not
too
complex
but
not
boring
either
highly
drinkable
well
this
seems
like
it
would
be
a
very
easy
beer
to
pound
id
give
it
a
5
but
theres
two
sides
to
drinkability
it
gets
a
1
on
the
enjoyment
scale
its
a
pretty
boring
beer
and
doesnt
hold
my
interest
long
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
bottle
that
averages
out
to
a
3
lowkey
finish
and
carbonation
that
doesnt
hold
insincerely
malty
aftertaste
that
makes
you
really
not
want
another
sip
drinkability
is
good
an
amazing
pilsner
price
is
good
and
this
can
be
paired
with
a
large
variety
of
food
overall
this
tastes
okay
but
i
dont
see
myself
buying
it
again
so
is
this
pilsener
triplehops
brewed
too
because
its
actually
a
pilsener
and
not
miller
lite
very
dry
taste
with
a
smooth
drinkable
body
solid
drinkability
i
wish
this
was
the
bud
light
people
love
this
should
be
the
rock
bottom
standard
for
beer
this
pilsener
kicks
ass
and
hopefully
with
america
slowly
turning
to
craft
beer
the
giants
may
someday
make
better
beer
too
drink
this
beer
when
beer
needs
to
be
drank
great
beer
even
with
the
weird
flaky
floaty
things
that
arent
supposed
to
be
there
this
beer
poured
a
strawcolor
with
a
singlefinger
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
floral
hops
with
a
tiny
bit
of
citrus
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
malt
that
gives
way
to
some
understated
citrusy
hops
that
last
until
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
slightly
watery
but
the
carbonation
makes
for
a
crisp
beer
a
tasty
beer
that
goes
down
real
easy
this
is
great
beer
for
any
occasion
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
great
head
and
nicely
active
carbonation
lots
of
nice
pilsener
aromas
that
feel
very
natural
a
raw
honey
sweetness
with
grassy
and
lemony
hops
this
beer
is
packed
with
all
the
tastes
that
its
aromas
promised
and
has
a
good
crispness
i
love
it
when
it
when
a
pilsener
refuses
to
play
it
bland
and
instead
is
infused
with
character
this
is
a
terrific
beer
the
whole
of
which
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
head
that
very
quickly
dissapates
into
nothing
not
much
lacing
to
speak
of
either
a
floral
hoppy
lift
on
the
nose
that
suggest
a
pretty
good
pils
and
a
good
upfront
palate
unfortunately
falls
away
a
little
at
the
back
with
not
much
finish
to
speak
of
subtle
bitterness
not
the
best
pils
going
round
by
any
means
but
not
the
worst
either
d
an
ok
brew
that
was
just
a
little
spicier
than
i
was
expecting
mediocre
overall
pours
out
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
nice
bright
white
head
with
nice
lacing
smells
of
spices
malt
and
a
floral
tone
taste
is
kind
of
spciy
for
a
german
pils
but
very
nice
nice
light
malt
background
with
a
crisp
light
citrus
hops
kind
of
an
off
taste
to
it
but
its
a
nice
clean
beer
very
mild
easy
to
drink
plenty
carbonation
for
a
pils
ok
but
theres
better
mouthfeel
was
medium
in
body
with
some
prickly
carbonation
solid
allaround
pours
a
pissy
macroish
yellow
head
dissipates
quickly
smells
very
crisp
malty
floral
some
hints
of
pear
taste
is
similar
but
much
stronger
its
bready
and
floral
and
like
i
said
earlier
crisp
slightly
bitter
finish
the
fruitiness
is
more
obvious
on
the
aftertaste
this
one
strikes
a
balance
between
the
relatively
flat
but
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
and
a
more
advanced
ale
or
lager
very
good
pours
a
very
clear
light
pale
with
an
average
white
head
and
light
lacing
smells
of
adjuncts
and
just
a
whiff
of
saaz
first
sip
is
extremely
light
with
the
malt
dominating
the
light
hops
not
much
hop
presence
but
then
again
there
is
not
much
malt
presence
either
spot
on
in
style
in
every
respect
grab
your
lawnmower
this
is
in
all
ways
a
solid
pils
nearly
great
even
there
is
enough
delicate
balance
to
make
this
almost
endlessly
drinkable
the
price
point
1212pack
doesnt
hurt
either
drinkability
i
could
down
a
couple
of
these
but
id
rather
look
at
and
smell
em
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
thin
white
head
nose
is
a
lot
of
cereal
sweetness
flavor
is
a
mix
of
sweet
tones
and
grain
character
smooth
but
no
vast
complexities
its
straightforward
and
thats
it
feel
has
a
bit
of
a
bite
on
the
carbonation
and
the
liquid
is
thinner
as
youd
expect
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pilsner
like
i
said
its
straightforward
and
thats
that
nicely
balanced
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
perfect
session
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
dry
sharp
german
pilsener
style
a
nice
enough
classsic
pils
the
slight
metallic
sharpness
was
a
detractor
for
me
though
still
a
solid
pils
perhaps
i
got
a
less
than
ideal
bottle
so
maybe
ill
come
back
to
this
and
experience
what
this
beer
really
wanted
to
do
to
my
tastebuds
d
like
any
good
pilsener
a
good
session
a
reasonable
choice
to
quench
a
thirst
far
more
body
than
it
looks
id
say
its
a
shade
above
light
bodied
nice
soft
mouthfeel
no
conflict
on
the
way
in
or
down
i
could
make
a
nice
session
out
of
these
bet
it
would
be
great
with
some
light
fish
like
tilapia
and
with
about
any
mettbrat
with
kraut
out
there
very
nice
surprise
here
i
had
a
crack
or
two
lined
up
in
my
head
but
got
a
humbling
reminder
of
the
book
and
its
cover
lesson
d
this
is
a
nice
one
overall
not
terribly
complex
but
nicely
executed
and
well
balanced
i
will
sample
again
in
a
few
weeks
this
was
a
great
surprise
found
at
a
german
bar
that
my
girfriend
and
i
went
for
lunch
last
week
no
specific
notes
as
i
went
in
expecting
to
just
be
drinking
paulaners
but
when
one
of
the
regulars
recomended
the
konig
pils
to
her
i
ended
up
tasting
and
then
enjoying
one
myself
mushc
more
malt
character
than
most
pils
perfect
to
wash
down
the
curried
bratwrust
and
spatzle
pretty
good
beer
has
a
very
bitter
beery
hoppy
nose
pale
gold
color
nice
white
head
with
some
lace
good
carbonation
quite
bitter
flavor
too
a
bit
thin
though
in
the
finish
it
seems
watery
still
its
refreshing
and
nice
that
its
not
sweet
session
beer
i
must
admit
after
seeing
its
overall
score
i
did
expect
more
than
this
delivered
drinkability
ok
at
best
but
lets
face
it
there
are
better
pilseners
to
be
had
d
easy
to
drink
abv
and
taste
wise
very
nice
light
beer
i
poured
mine
up
in
a
standard
tall
pilsener
glass
and
was
treated
to
a
light
golden
transparent
brew
that
built
little
head
and
left
almost
no
lacing
it
looks
like
a
pilsener
but
drinks
more
like
a
helles
lacking
a
real
hop
presence
even
on
the
finish
the
nose
is
mostly
understated
malt
and
the
flavor
is
rather
noncomplex
basically
matching
the
aroma
the
overall
mouthfeel
if
fresh
and
crisp
with
a
nearly
perfect
level
of
carbonation
i
could
drink
several
of
these
over
a
long
late
afternoon
with
friends
in
the
waning
sunshine
id
say
its
an
excellent
example
of
the
style
jane
would
say
who
doesnt
like
beer
sitting
in
a
beer
garden
by
the
spree
on
a
sunny
day
in
berlin
anything
is
going
to
taste
nice
but
i
stand
by
this
review
a
great
pilsner
crisp
refreshing
and
plenty
drinkable
light
yellow
macro
like
color
with
a
quickly
fading
head
aroma
is
skunk
that
most
german
pilseners
seem
to
have
taste
is
a
mix
of
skunk
and
grape
in
my
opinion
not
impressive
but
somebody
who
likes
this
style
probably
would
disagree
this
is
not
something
i
would
get
again
in
the
future
d
overall
a
very
good
clean
malt
bill
highlighting
a
true
to
style
german
pilsner
with
a
very
good
drinkability
factor
overall
not
a
bad
pilsner
just
a
little
average
and
bland
for
me
not
terrible
though
by
any
means
and
a
good
representation
of
the
style
just
needs
a
little
bit
more
life
to
it
not
too
bad
overall
the
lack
of
fruity
hops
is
disappointing
this
tastes
more
like
a
premium
lager
than
a
pilsener
to
me
d
a
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
but
i
am
not
a
huge
pilsner
fan
personally
this
is
by
far
on
the
best
cheap
beers
ive
had
at
at
only
2
19
for
a
tall
can
this
is
a
great
value
very
tasty
and
drinkable
beer
here
a
very
balanced
and
flavorful
german
pilsener
a
beer
i
can
recommend
the
taste
is
fruity
grain
apple
and
honey
giving
a
light
fruityhoney
sweetness
that
is
just
dominated
by
the
bitter
herbalpine
hops
rereview
either
i
massively
overrated
this
beer
to
begin
with
or
its
just
not
the
beer
it
used
to
be
a
decent
pilsener
but
nothing
too
special
i
tried
this
beer
on
october
18
2007
after
purchasing
from
my
local
lcbo
outlet
the
beer
poured
a
very
pale
gold
colour
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
which
quickly
disappeared
the
aroma
was
a
combination
of
citrusy
hops
with
some
grainy
backup
the
mouthfeel
was
this
slightly
watery
with
ample
carbonation
the
flavour
was
slighty
hoppy
and
a
little
bitter
not
too
bad
its
light
and
refreshing
yet
still
has
some
flavor
and
character
i
had
this
really
cold
and
its
already
hot
here
in
texas
so
it
went
down
in
less
than
five
minutes
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
and
im
getting
a
case
tomorrow
a
great
everyday
drinking
beer
d
this
is
a
great
german
pils
nothing
fancy
just
solid
well
broughtout
flavours
and
a
clean
crisp
taste
making
this
beer
very
refreshing
very
very
easy
to
drink
i
wish
i
had
a
few
more
right
now
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
nice
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
some
light
breadlike
notes
its
dry
with
some
german
hop
character
the
taste
is
decent
it
has
a
very
dry
pilsner
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
quick
and
easy
and
finishes
clean
with
some
light
hop
bitterness
its
a
basic
recipe
with
little
malt
complexity
but
it
works
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
lowmedium
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
german
pils
its
nothing
fancy
yet
well
brewed

medium

in

is
dry
bitter
a
bit
of
lemon
too
refreshing
though
im
not
fond
of
cans
this
is
a
very
good
pilsener
maybe
it
lacks
of
some
more
aroma
or
maybe
is
just
the
can
thing
but
its
a
very
enjoyable
beer
first
beer
i
have
tried
from
this
brewer
also
had
never
heard
of
this
one
before
either
probably
would
not
drink
again
but
not
bad
for
a
european
pilsener
d
serviceable
but
not
substantially
different
than
one
of
the
usual
euro
pilsners
taste
is
medium
bitter
and
hoppy
with
a
raw
hop
extract
edge
the
malt
is
still
a
bit
green
but
when
i
drank
my
way
through
it
started
to
disappear
body
was
ok
and
drinkability
was
good
quite
a
refreshing
beer
but
not
a
high
flyer
an
average
german
pilsner

on
the

it
pours
a
lightlypale
gold
with
medium
carbonation
and
an
inch
of
white
head
smells
biscuity
a
bit
buttery
with
skunky
and
spicy
hops
in
the
background
toasted
and
buttery
malts
form
the
base
of
the
flavor
and
on
top
of
this
are
grassy
spicy
almost
piney
hops
that
impart
a
medium
but
almost
distracting
bitterness
the
body
is
medium
with
equal
carbonation
and
finish
and
is
quite
dry
on
the
palate
overall
a
wellcrafted
quite
refreshing
easilysessionable
brew
but
the
bitterness
is
a
tad
higher
than
im
used
to
for
they
style
that
aside
i
really
love
these
european
pilsners
its
what
plainold
beer
should
taste
like
d
very
easy
drinking
and
well
made

the

and
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
on
a
hot
summer
daythis
would
go
over
quite
wellhighly
enjoyed
this
one
d
this
is
a
fine
example
of
a
german
pilsner
its
crisp
clean
with
an
appropriate
level
of
hops
and
the
malt
to
support
pours
out
a
lightly
faded
gold
with
abundant
champagnelike
carbonation
and
a
sturdy
head
that
leaves
rings
of
lace
after
each
sip
great
floral
and
earthy
hop
presence
in
the
nose
with
a
solid
sweetish
malt
backbone
with
just
a
touch
of
graininess
flavor
is
bright
and
with
a
light
maltiness
there
is
some
crackery
flavor
from
the
malt
with
just
a
kiss
of
sweetness
hops
come
very
floral
and
almost
grapey
and
leave
a
nice
lingering
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
lightbodied
and
spritzy
but
a
lingering
residual
sweetness
makes
this
just
the
slightest
bit
sticky
some
peculiarities
with
the
mouthfeel
affect
the
drinkability
slightly
but
this
is
still
a
good
session
its
like
your
typical
german
pilsener
but
watered
down
if
you
ask
me
a
decent
pilsner
for
sure
pours
a
pale
golden
straw
color
with
a
decent
amount
of
chunky
white
head
that
fades
quickly
but
laces
the
glass
smells
slightly
of
yeast
and
noble
hops
smells
like
it
might
be
bitter
tastes
like
not
much
sweetness
or
malt
flavor
but
a
good
amount
of
hop
bitterness
finishes
clean
mouthfeel
is
very
creamy
at
first
turning
into
tingly
near
the
end
not
bad
at
all
overall
its
very
drinkable
not
too
unbalanced
finishes
well
gold
yellow
clear
bubbly
with
foamy
head
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
carbonated
mostly
a
mild
skunk
hops
in
the
nose
but
little
of
that
a
bit
of
bready
malt
at
first
taste
with
a
very
mild
hops
bite
unfortunately
like
so
many
german
imports
of
this
lightcolored
lower
hopped
lager
variety
there
was
a
strange
underlying
cardboard
metallic
taste
that
for
me
at
least
undermined
the
sheer
drinkability
of
the
beer
otherwise
this
would
be
a
very
tasty
one
indeed
it
wasnt
bad
and
with
german
celebrities
like
til
schweiger
driven
king
arthur
overall
pleasant
and
refreshing
nothing
spectacular
but
a
fine
german
pilsener
drinkability
i
wouldnt
say
no
to
one
i
guess
but
its
not
a
standout
pilsner
very
much
a
run
of
the
mill
mass
produced
offering
still
prefer
it
to
carling
though
light
mouthfeel
and
very
easy
to
drink
i
will
be
back
for
more
of
this
one
for
sure
prosit
und
zum
wohl
mk
not
artisanal
for
sure
but
well
made
d
i
could
easily
spend
a
session
with
this
beer
its
very
tasty
a
great
example
of
a
german
pilsner
light
and
smooth
yeah
its
a
good
one
overall
slack
at
times
clean
but
stunningly
average
and
attractive
with
its
simplistic
poise
average
though
okönig
so
to
speak
this
poured
from
the
can
to
a
typical
pilsener
yellow
with
a
head
that
reduced
to
a
bit
of
chunk
on
the
top
smell
is
clean
with
lots
of
barley
taste
is
quite
hoppy
not
excessive
just
right
for
the
hop
content
this
brew
is
quite
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
a
little
bitter
which
gives
it
an
edge
but
overall
not
bad
at
all
d
good
though
it
is
fairly
hoppy
and
i
wasnt
overly
fond
of
these
hop
flavours
no
green
bottle
here
color
is
a
sparkling
golden
with
plenty
of
carbonation
the
foamy
head
is
tall
and
thick
retention
is
above
average
aroma
is
sweet
and
grainy
with
a
mild
herbal
hop
smell
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
sweet
and
grainy
taste
is
less
dry
than
most
pils
with
a
bit
more
of
a
sweet
malt
flavor
herbal
hop
is
there
but
not
as
strong
as
expected
anyway
this
pils
had
some
helleslike
qualities
that
i
really
enjoyed
this
is
definently
better
that
most
of
the
german
pilseners
that
make
it
to
the
states
this
follows
the
textbook
style
of
german
brewing
the
heavy
milk
like
lace
and
sun
tainted
skunk
smell
is
the
first
thing
you
get
from
it
it
has
somewhat
of
a
cleaner
taste
then
some
of
the
other
pilsners
ive
had
the
beer
follows
the
footsteps
of
all
the
others
from
the
region
but
i
get
a
little
more
yeast
taste
from
it
the
price
is
cheaper
that
the
others
as
well
if
i
was
looking
for
this
style
i
would
probably
pick
this
one
up
again
but
the
truly
worthy
trait
was
the
taste
this
lager
rather
surprised
me
to
the
point
of
giving
it
a
high
rating
because
i
found
it
exceptionally
refreshing
with
a
strong
hoppy
finish
not
overwhelming
however
considerably
strong
felt
i
was
fascinated
well
however
much
a
pilsener
can
do
that
to
me
but
still
this
is
a
fairly
good
beer
if
i
ever
spot
it
as
one
of
my
choices
erm
if
ever
in
germany
soon
overall
i
can
say
my
expectations
were
exceeded
with
this
pils
maybe
even
better
than
bitburger
my
german
pils
benchmark
canned
sample
medium
gold
in
colour
with
high
carbonation
grainy
malt
aroma
is
dominant
with
some
very
mild
soapy
notes
on
the
back
end
malt
dominated
flavors
as
well
with
some
grassy
noble
hop
contributions
and
some
mineral
notes
solid
bitterness
with
a
slightly
drying
white
flour
quality
on
the
finish
nothing
special
but
fairly
satisfying
especially
on
a
warm
day
you
could
do
much
worse
pours
a
clear
golden
big
frothy
white
head
forms
that
refuses
to
go
little
bit
of
lace
light
sweet
malt
some
citrusy
hops
are
present
honey
taste
is
sweet
and
honeylike
little
bit
of
citrus
near
the
end
nice
dry
finish
little
bitter
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
very
smooth
pretty
tasty
for
a
generic
german
pilsener
a
yellowgold
colored
german
pils
with
a
nice
retentive
white
frothy
cap
laces
well
aroma
is
malt
pronouced
and
sweetish
with
light
pine
like
aromas
great
malt
delivery
to
the
palate
bready
but
light
sweetness
is
balanced
well
with
pinecitrus
hops
but
it
is
a
mellow
hop
presense
not
sharp
like
the
czech
pils
finish
is
mild
and
bisquity
with
a
light
citrus
twang
i
like
this
smooth
tastey
pils
and
at
this
price
leave
the
domestic
crap
and
cheaper
commie
pilsners
on
the
shelf
this
one
delivers
a
great
german
malty
taste
in
mellow
balence
with
pinecitrus
hopping
for
a
pleasant
fresh
taste
pours
a
slightly
darker
than
standard
clear
gold
under
a
very
disappointing
12
finger
fizzy
white
head
that
faded
way
to
fast
for
a
pilsener
and
left
no
lace
the
nose
of
mild
sweet
malt
is
ok
but
could
use
a
bit
more
hoppy
spice
the
mouth
is
solid
very
prickly
and
slightly
sticky
taste
has
the
requisite
sweet
barley
opening
but
the
hoppy
bitter
followup
is
too
subdued
even
hard
to
find
theres
some
dryness
in
the
finish
but
malt
is
the
predominant
component
its
ok
but
by
no
means
great
go
to
the
lower
rhine
and
have
one
on
tap
not
quite
as
crisp
as
some
but
overall
a
good
example
of
the
style
clean
light
malt
flavors
with
some
grapesodalike
notes
in
the
background
overall
the
beers
character
is
bright
with
light
hopping
slapping
a
dash
of
bitterness
at
the
end
quite
smooth
and
classy
a
very
solid
northern
style
german
pilsner
pours
a
nice
fluffy
head
lacing
to
midway
through
the
glass
light
golden
colour
with
mild
carbonation
both
malt
and
hops
are
present
in
this
brew
finishes
off
with
a
quick
bitterness
defines
a
german
pilener
very
well
my
favourite
pilsener
can
always
be
found
in
the
fridge
or
on
the
dinner
table
this
konig
brauerei
pilsener
was
packaged
in
an
american
style
brown
longneck
bottle
the
pour
showed
a
golden
body
that
was
mostly
clear
or
pehaps
just
a
bit
hazy
the
head
what
there
was
of
it
was
white
and
it
settled
into
a
thin
layer
that
left
some
pretty
nice
sticky
lace
lots
of
malt
nose
with
a
hint
of
fruity
hops
constant
flows
of
carbonation
bubbles
help
give
this
beer
a
crisp
mouthfeel
though
the
feel
is
also
a
bit
thin
plenty
of
hop
bitterness
makes
the
malt
seem
less
sweet
than
it
probably
is
a
good
strong
pilsener
beer
that
is
fairly
true
to
the
style
pours
a
hazy
golden
yellow
color
with
a
modest
sized
white
head
that
fades
into
a
thin
and
sticky
lace
nose
is
sweet

and

with
a
bit
of
citrusy

light
in

and
very
crisp
and
refreshing
taste

grains
with
some
bready
biscuity
notes
followed
by
some
bitter
hops
and
a
bit
of
lemon
leaving
a
dry
finish
a
very
nice
pilsner
that
i
will
always
gladly
make
room
for
in

beer
a
nice
solid
pilsner
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
this
is
def
one
of
my
gotos
this
is
my
favorite
pilsner
has
a
distinctive
refreshing
taste
very
fresh
and
extremely
easy
to
drink
avoid
the
brown
bottle
version
with
the
twistoff
cap
however
it
was
stale
and
skunky
stick
with
the
original
green
bottles
in
a
style
filled
with
so
many
tastealike
beers
this
one
stands
out

clean
and

with
a

i
might

take

mine

it
could

the
combination
of

best
pilsners

better
on

the
similar
a
fine
pils
to
be
had
any
time
of
the
year
a
treat
for
either
the
veteran
micro
drinker
or
a
macro
drinker
goes
down
well
yet
very
tasty
at
the
same
time
its
decent
and
very
easy
drinking
but
also
feels
very
dumbed
down
while
good
and
pleasurable
id
probably
prefer
a
different
brand
or
maker
but
she
will
work
fine
overall
a
very
well
executed
german
pils
great
easy
drinker
that
you
can
easily
obtain
at
a
reasonable
value
give
it
a
try
o
that
fruity
start
is
kind
of
wild
for
the
style
its
so
sweet
it
truly
comes
off
like
an
english
pale
ale
at
first
that
sweet
fruity
twist
is
cool
and
overall
its
a
tasty
drinkable
brew
but
its
just
a
hair
above
average
id
use
this
beer
for
gateway
purposes
because
its
so
sweet
to
start
off
with
that
even
nonbeer
drinkers
might
enjoy
it
o
this
is
a
really
good
pilsener
highly
recommended
yes
it
is
a
can
as
it
is
not
pressurized
and
pours
via
gravity

and

suddenly
crashed
our
party
desirous
of
a
sip
it
smelled
great
like
strong
honey
underlain
by
a
pleasant
grassiness
it
was
most
definitely
a
german
pilsner
czech
pilsners
would
be
the
opposite
grassy
underlain
by
honey
my
mouth
was
watering
in
anticipation
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
light
and
thin
but
that
is
to
be
expected
in
the
style
the
taste
was
very
honeylike
and
i
was
reminded
of
the
air
freshener
in
my
exold
ladys
car
she
is
an
apiarist
and
keeps
honeycombs
in
the

it
was
on
the
finish
that
i
again
tasted
noble
grassy
hops
giving
the
beer
as
semisweetness
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
plus
i
got
to
turn
some
other
people
on
to
it
as
a
result
of
its
medium
you
can
believe
that
i
am
going
to
be
looking
into
procuring
more
minikegs
in
the
future
the
flavor
comes
together
just
as
my
head
was
casting
doubt
based
on
the
aroma
tastes
a
little
clean
with
grassy
woody
and
raw
grain
flavors
it
has
a
soft
body
with
gentle
crispness
and
even
a
touch
of
creaminess
true
another
german
pilsner
but
its
certainly
better
than
the
warsteiners
of
the
world
i
had
greatly
anticipated
the
opening
of
this
bottle
had
heard
some
nice
comments
about
it
but
as
soon
as
i
opened
it
i
smelled
skunk
same
as
heineken
guess
i
am
not
a
german
pilsner
kind
of
guy
maybe
it
was
not
fair
since
i
had
just
finished
a
bottle
of
pranqster
belgian
style
golden
ale
that
was
excellent
at
92
points
i
just
dont
like
the
skunky
in
a
beer
i
will
not
buy
again
rjt
recommended
music
pairing
uncle
tupelo
still
feel
gone
glad
i
tried
this
it
came
with
my
beer
of
the
month
club
but
i
wont
be
looking
for
it
again
on
tap
at
kickbacks
in
jax
poured
into
a
snifter
white
head
moderate
retention
on
a
clear
light
yellow
body
suddsy
lacing
sticks
to
the
glass
aroma
includes
a
light
hoppy
note
some
pilsner
malt
maybe
some
lemon
peel
taste
is
light
refreshing
mild
bitterness
slight
sweetness
on
the
back
end
the
taste
can
only
be
described
as
a
light
pilsner
taste
and
clearly
authentic
tasty
if
this
eku
pils
is
the
c
lassic
german
pilsner
then
whats
the
deal
with
kulmbachers
edelherb
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
lightly
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
honeydripped
biscuit
light
grass
and
a
kiss
of
flower
petal
the
taste
holds
notes
of
old
biscuit
dank
greens
iceberg
lettuce
and
a
general
sense
that
the
world
just
isnt
quite
right
that
the
matrix
may
in
fact
be
real
and
its
having
a
hard
time
coding
the
flavor
of
beer
man
this
stuff
just
jumped
off
a
cliff
and
destroyed
itself
upon
the
rocks
at
the
base
but
the
eyes
are
still
open
and
trying
to
process
the
horror
it
just
experienced
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
slightly
oily
feel
overall
this
is
the
second
time
ive
had
this
beer
and
both
times
have
been
incredibly
disappointing
and
i
made
sure
this
stuff
was
pretty
fresh
too
so
its
not
like
ive
been
sitting
on
a
bottle
for
years
or
anything
ive
just
gotta
say
it
this
is
a
fairly
crappy
pils
sigh
drinkability
is
good
a
fine
pils
clean
nice
flavor
but
balanced
and
restrained
overall
with
all
the
great
pilsners
available
in
the
us
i
wouldnt
go
to
this
one
again
doesnt
measure
up
to
prima
pils
and
others
o
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
it
would
seem
to
make
a
good
pairing
with
food
because
the
taste
isnt
that
strong
while
drinking
this
and
writing
the
review
i
didnt
even
notice
how
quickly
i
had
finished
the
beer
this
is
just
a
very
crisp
clear
german
pilsener
that
showcases
everything
enjoyable
about
the
style
o
an
excellent
pils
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
drink
it
more
often
overall
nice
a
bit
lighter
than
expected
nice
malts
crisp
and
clean
finishes
a
bit
too
quick
as
well
overall
this
is
a
showcase
pilsner
and
a
great
example
of
its
style
i
put
it
right
up
there
with
victory
prima
pils
overall
very
light
clean
and
bland
with
a
faint
bitterness
that
fades
quickly
im
not
a
fan
of
light
beer
in
general
but
this
was
more
subtle
than
any
other
light
beer
ive
tried
overall
not
a
bad
representation
of
the
breed
but
nowhere
near
best
in
class
this
pils
would
be
good
for
a
few
bottles
but
gets
boring
after
while
overall
on
the
lighter
side
and
i
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
it
out
but
am
a
little
intrigued
with
the
subtle
sweet
surprise
interesting
to
have
a
fruit
different
than
a
wit
orange
of
hw
banana
clove
overall
a
very
sessionable
beer
but
theres
many
better
fish
in
the
sea
a
decent
easy
to
enjoy
pilsner
for
those
who
are
fans
of
the
style
worth
a
try
i
really
want
to
find
a
german
pils
that
i
like
i
feel
bad
that
they
all
taste
the
same
to
me
and
its
rather
disappointing
this
beer
is
clear
yellow
its
earthy
and
mild
flavored
fresh
cut
grass
on
the
taste
too
not
much
hops
on
the
nose
not
my
favorite
style
d
light
refreshing
clean
crisp
easy
to
drink
although
maybe
a
little
bit
boring
would
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
perhaps
paired
with
any
hot
spicy
dish
d
great
palatability
excellent
drinkability
my
overall
impression
us
that
this
is
the
best
beer
of
the
month
club
beer
ive
been
sent
it
is
tasty
it
is
good
enough
that
i
will
actually
drink
the
rest
of
them
rather
than
give
them
away
d
again
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
so
i
generally
dont
want
another
that
said
this
is
one
that
i
could
have
a
few
of
if
nothing
of
another
style
or
only
bmc
were
available
11
2
oz
single
very
pale
gold
lager
tight
white
head
good
lace
actually
nice
hoppy
aroma
saaz
hops
but
really
bright
and
clear
taste
is
more
balanced
than
i
imagined
but
the
hops
shine
through
at
the
end
though
rather
balanced
for
a
german
pils
it
pulls
it
off
actually
a
nice
silky
smooth
palate
if
thats
possible
for
the
style
overall
i
liked
this
one
and
found
it
drinkable
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
watery
body
was
light
and
crisp
with
light
carbonation
and
a
slight
bitter
finish
high
drinkability
it
goes
down
easy
but
is
just
a
little
reserved
to
be
exciting
good
session
beer
that
could
flow
all
night
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
even
if
its
not
very
impressive
easy
to
drink
i
bought
a
larger
fridge
keg
of
this
at
my
local
bevmo
it
was
on
sale
and
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
it
is
a
straightforward
german
pilsner
with
a
hint
of
lager
taste
the
beer
is
a
beautiful
golden
color
has
a
strong
aroma
which
is
sweet
leaves
a
slight
aftertaste
and
is
easy
to
drink
definitely
worth
a
try
especially
if
you
like
st
pauli
or
steinlager
bleh
im
not
impressed
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
drinkability
this
was
good
enough
to
finish
but
i
wouldnt
buy
again
opinion
this
is
a
really
good
beer
in
my
opinion
and
this
is
the
second
sixpack
that
i
have
drank
in
the
week
that
i
have
been
traveling
so
it
definitely
goes
down
easily
i
am
anxious
to
try
it
again
is
a
more
proper
setting
but
this
beer
is
good
enough
that
it
isnt
suffering
even
from
this
inferior
presentation
i
am
looking
forward
to
drinking
this
beer
again
d
this
was
really
pretty
good
i
feared
it
might
be
old
because
of
the
high
price
point
quite
a
tasty
german
pils
pours
a
pale
gold
color
aroma
is
of
floral
hops
and
grassy
grain
it
is
a
totally
straightforward
pilsner
with
the
taste
of
grain
and
peppery
hops
with
a
malty
backbone
and
a
very
dry
finish
might
not
be
the
most
intricate
beer
but
on
a
hot
summer
day
it
sure
beats
water
pours
an
ultra
clear
golden
yellow
with
slow
bubble
trailers
a
thin
head
sticks
to
the
sides
of
the
glass
nicely
smell
is
beerlike
aka
malty
and
a
tad
sweet
and
grassy
taste
is
smooth
at
first
twisting
into
a
hoppy
high
and
malty
backbone
nothing
bad
just
a
good
pilsner
taste
with
a
solid
bitter
and
a
bit
of
tankard
finish
drinkability
is
expectedly
high
on
tap
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
bright
and
clear
in
the
glass
goldenhued
with
a
thick
frothy
head
nice
spicy
hop
aroma
quite
fragrant
and
fresh
a
bit
grassy
crackery
pale
malt
resides
right
beside
the
hops
and
the
yeast
profile
is
clean
showing
only
a
hint
of
sulfur
its
crisp
and
dry
on
the
tongue
more
hoppy
than
malty
with
a
robust
spicyherbalgreengrassy
hop
character
theres
a
touch
of
dry
maltiness
around
the
midpalate
reminiscent
of
a
sweet
baguette
finishing
with
a
firm
punchy
and
lingering
bitterness
this
is
especially
dry
and
bitter
for
a
german
pils
43
5444
drinkability
its
another
hot
muggy
stinky
in
all
the
wrong
places
kind
of
day
in
georgia
and
its
not
even
summertime
yet
and
as
much
i
enjoy
a
fullbodied
hearty
stout
i
was
definitely
looking
for
something
lighter
and
more
refreshing
to
satisfy
while
its
not
the
punchiest
pils
on
the
block
this
could
be
an
issue
of
freshness
sadly
there
a
no
apparent
dating
codes
on
the
bottle
it
did
fare
well
with
me
when
it
came
to
being
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
eku
pils
pours
a
nice
golden
color
with
little
head
that
doesnt
stick
around
for
too
long
the
beer
looks
very
average
the
taste
is
stronger
than
i
was
expecting
a
little
bitter
even
aftertaste
lingers
a
little
overall
this
is
a
good
pilsener
but
probably
not
the
best
beer
ive
ever
had
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
its
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
but
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
that
i
would
choose
first
d
a
nice
easy
drinking
smooth
welllagered
and
slightly
bitter
german
pilsner
an
ok
beer
but
not
one
i
will
likely
buy
again
because
i
like
more
hop
bite
in
my
pilsners
drinkability
very
easy
drinking
if
you
want
session
beer
you
want
pils
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
crisp
edgy
and
zippy
the
body
of
the
beer
is
carbonated
and
the
finish
is
medium
this
beer
has
a
nice
pilsner
flavor
with
a
zesty
body
i
like
it
very
much
overall
a
decent
representation
of
the
style
but
im
pretty
sure
this
bottle
has
some
unwarranted
age
on
it
that
has
caused
it
to
become
something
slightly
less
desireable
still
a
good
session
beer
and
one
i
could
drink
a
couple
of
with
ease
a
nice
pils
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
german
pilsner
that
really
fits
the
bill
drinkability
was
a
4
5
this
was
an
awesome
surprise
i
bought
it
as
a
german
pils
mini
keg
for
our
2009
ofest
party
world
mkt
had
them
on
sale
for
14
99
it
was
a
a
great
comparison
for
homebrew
tasting
light
and
well
carbonated
this
was
an
easy
drinker
i
could
hit
this
all
day
in
the
summer
just
knock
em
back
in
front
of
the
grill
not
super
complex
but
it
is
what
it
is
supposed
to
be
i
dug
this
one
d
refreshing
and
light
very
drinkable
d
could
certainly
drink
a
lot
due
to
the
light
quality
but
nothing
noteworthy
clear
yellow
body
is
topped
by
a
sizeable
white
head
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
lighter
side
decent
flowery
hop
taste
and
a
nice
amount
of
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
a
little
thin
and
watery
edit
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
it
and
was
very
disappointed
was
quite
plain
in
bottle
form
no
skunky
taste
at
all
which
was
ironic
d
good
to
average
pilsner
d
would
love
to
have
with
a
multitude
of
bbq
food
and
on
a
warm
day
not
horrible
but
there
are
many
better
d
easily
drinkable
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
the
hop
aroma
could
be
a
bit
stronger
and
i
have
had
other
pilsners
with
a
richer
malt
complexity
one
of
the
best
german
pilsners
i
have
come
across
in
the
us
god
i
love
pils
drinkability
so
refreshing
great
beer
on
a
hot
day
gone
quickly
and
another
would
be
welcome
id
love
to
taste
this
recipe
as
an
imperial
pilsner
that
would
be
amazing
pours
a
perfectly
clear
gold
with
a
billowing
white
head
the
foam
reduces
to
a
small
solid
cap
with
great
lacing
strong
aromas
of
grassy
grainy
pilsener
malts
hit
the
nose
nice
light
sweetness
without
much
hop
presence
this
grainy
malt
character
is
dominant
in
the
taste
as
well
though
slightly
floral
hops
come
forward
nice
peppery
dry
finish
lightmedium
body
overall
a
very
refreshing
wellcrafted
lager
drinkability
a
little
out
of
place
for
me
in
the
dead
of
winter
but
this
would
stand
up
well
to
some
ribs
pulled
pork
or
chili
there
wasnt
that
much
flavor
to
it
except
a
bitter
taste
but
not
pilsner
bittermore
like
skunk
bitter
it
also
left
a
horrible
taste
in
the
back
of
my
throat
i
was
also
disappointed
because
i
hold
the
germans
to
a
higher
standard
when
it
comes
to
beers
drinkability
it
was
light
so
definitely
drinkable
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
drink
again
the
body
is
like
seltzer
which
is
also
what
the
flavor
reminds
me
of
simply
said
this
is
a
waste
of
a
bottle
interestingly
this
beer
is
not
skunky
this
is
a
really
good
pilsner
light
palette
but
a
nice
flavor
great
tasting
and
refreshing
drinkability
see
my
taste
notes
above
decidedly
average
it
hits
some
of
the
right
notes
and
misses
others
and
though
its
fairly
drinkable
due
to
its
crispness
and
low
abv
i
dont
see
myself
reaching
for
it
again
pours
pale
gold
with
a
large
white
head
and
good
lacings
aroma
is
lightly
skunked
taste
is
bitter
hops
with
good
support
from
the
slightly
sweet
malts
nice
clean
pils
with
a
bitter
dry
finish
mouthfeel
is
good
and
drinkability
is
good
considering
it
has
an
abv

a
decent
journeyman
pils
d
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
it
has
great
balance
some
nice
complexity
and
is
easily
sessionable
cheers
d
overall
a
nice
session
beer
not
my
favorite
take
on
the
style
but
definitely
worth
a
revisit
pours
a
light
gold
with
massive
head
thanks
to
great
carbonation
when
it
does
die
it
leaves
some
lacing
a
wet
grass
aroma
of
faint
hops
and
very
few
malts
surprisingly
i
found
that
the
beers
taste
had
a
good
malt
presence
better
than
the
smell
hops
are
subdued
and
this
isnt
a
dry
pils
more
like
a
soft
one
finishes
smooth
and
almost
slick
while
retaining
some
crispness
not
bad
at
all
a
decent
pils
and
very
refreshing
great
for
a
summer
day
or
a
warm
fall
day
drinkability
a
few
of
my
friends
showed
up
on
my
doorstep
with
a
5
liter
mini
keg
of
this
the
other
night
really
a
pleasant
beer
for
sitting
on
the
porch
and
enjoying
the
cooling
weather
d
very
easy
drinking
clean
with
some
decent
balance
this
brew
poured
into
a
tall
pilsner
glass
on
tap
was
a
clear
bright
gold
color
with
a
big
fluffy
white
head
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
was
a
pretty
flowery
wheat
bready
like
many
decent
pilsners
the
feel
is
midland
for
this
style
fair
quality
with
mild
carbonation
i
pick
up
light
oak
and
sweet
wheat
its
clean
and
crisp
very
drinkable
if
you
want
something
light
and
refreshing
but
it
isnt
anything
special
no
complexity
and
it
doesnt
quite
grab
your
tastebuds
like
the
best
pils
can
do
but
im
happy
to
drink
it
and
would
do
so
again
depending
upon
the
choices
on
a
warm
summer
night
d
a
modest
drinking
pilsner
but
a
tad
sweet
per
style
wouldnt
drink
this
on
a
regular
basis
or
hold
my
attention
as
a
session
d
drinks
pretty
well
i
will
be
having
this
with
dinner
now
it
would
go
well
with
food
appearance
has
a
light
straw
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
smell
of
sweet
light
malt
and
hop
maybe
even
a
bit
biscuity
taste
is
lightly
sweet
grainy
with
some
breadiness
and
lightly
hopped
mouthfeel
is
light
crisp
and
finishes
clean
an
excellent
drinker
one
id
love
to
try
on
tap
in
germany
the
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
gferman
pilsner
but
still
has
a
light
persistent
bitterness
and
long
gentle
finish
of
grain
and
herbs
it
has
pretty
good
malty
body
with
giving
a
lightly
oily
texture
and
good
grain
flavour
but
it
needs
a
little
more
hops
to
rank
with
other
german
pilsners
salud
d
highly
drinkable
despite
a
somewhat
average
flavor
i
like
how
the
peppery
saaz
notes
fade
away
after
swallowing
only
to
reemerge
in
a
burp
and
remind
you
of
how
spicy
this
one
is
pours
a
brilliant
light
yellowgold
w
a
creamy
white
head
which
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
decent
lacing
down
my
pilsn
glass
a
strong
smell
mostly
floralherbal
hop
and
steely
grain
not
much
else
a
crisp
flavor
w
a
decent
hop
bite
blends
well
with
cereal
grains
for
that
cured
concrete
pils
flavor
an
excellent
balance
a
fairly
dry
light
bodied
brew
w
loads
of
carbonation
an
excellent
pilsner
very
drinkable
a
shame
i
have
only
one
ill
have
to
remedy
that
by
this
summer
d
this
is
a
lot
better
than
i
expected
this
has
great
flavor
its
fairly
simple
yet
well
balanced
and
has
a
couple
surprises
hidden
in
the
taste
this
would
be
something
i
would
get
more
of
but
its
hard
to
find
a
6
pack
of
this
decent
drinking
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
had
on
tap
at
the
moan
and
dove
settled
with
a
watery
gold
amber
beverage
very
clear
the
drink
had
a
well
sized
medium
to
eventual
thin
head
grassy
hops
were
well
established
in
its
aroma
along
with
a
woody
texture
great
earthy
flavors
in
the
taste
as
well
wrapped
in
the
bittersweet
hops
of
the
beverage
excellent
carbonation
this
was
an
extremely
refreshing
and
enjoyable
beverage
overall
if
you
like
earthy
goodness
this
is
your
drink
the
taste
was
not
clean
and
spread
out
it
left
some
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
but
was
not
overly
noticeable
this
would
be
a
good
brew
in
the
summer
for
sure
overall
i
thought
it
was
okay
mouthfeeldrinkability
its
light
bodied
has
a
nice
crisp
bite
and
is
well
carbonated
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
is
drinkable
that
being
said
the
flavor
is
nothing
special
which
somewhat
limits
its
drinkability
overall
its
an
alright
beer
i
wouldnt
characterize
it
as
special
in
any
respect
a
refreshing
quenchthirster
despite
touch
of
bitterness
not
something
i
normally
complain
about
but
a
bit
off
here
smooth
disappears
quickly
d
this
one
is
super
drinkable
even
for
a
pils
and
one
of
the
few
examples
of
the
style
that
i
can
say
i
have
actually
enjoyed
when
i
drank
it
d
pretty
nice
pils
well
balanced
and
sexy
mouthfeel
the
only
knock
here
is
the
rather
bland
appearance
mild
grainy
slightly
hoppy
aroma
clear
yellowgold
with
frothy
white
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
bitter
and
dry
but
fairly
well
balanced
overall
some
maltiness
became
more
apprarent
as
beer
warmed
up
slight
alcohol
detectable
in
flavor
medium
carbonation
light
body
dry
finish
somewhat
drying
mouthfeel
right
on
for
carbonation
all
in
all
a
very
good
beer
5l
keg
at
our
septoberfest
party
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
thick
and
frothy
bone
white
head
that
dissipates
slowly
spotty
lacing
light
hops
and
malt
aroma
lightbodied
and
crisp
with
mild
citrusy
hops
and
sweet
malt
flavors
the
finish
is
clean
and
zesty
with
a
lightly
bitter
hops
aftertaste
just
ok
overall
overall
a
decent
pils
however
there
are
much
better
and
more
complex
examples
available
overall
one
of
the
bettertasting
pilseners
ive
had
this
beer
has
a
very
smooth
creamy
feel
to
it
accompanied
by
a
taste
that
combines
hops
and
malts
without
letting
one
or
the
other
get
too
out
of
hand
highly
recommended
if
youre
looking
for
a
pilsener
this
is
a
very
average
beer
it
is
a
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
there
is
some
lacing
but
not
a
lot
the
smell
is
funny
because
straight
out
of
the
bottle
this
had
quite
a
whiff
of
skunk
but
it
dissapeared
pretty
quickly
after
the
skunk
came
your
wet
straw
some
citrus
and
then
a
bit
of
sunflower
as
the
beer
settled
the
taste
underwent
some
changes
too
at
first
the
hoppiness
came
through
more
so
than
when
the
beer
finally
settled
this
is
a
slightly
watery
light
bodied
medium
carbonation
beer
with
not
much
going
on
one
way
or
the
other
what
do
i
get
are
hints
of
the
following
in
the
taste
dryness
straw
some
bits
of
citrus
bite
a
peppery
bitterness
at
the
end
some
maltiness
in
the
mid
section
eh
this
is
just
average
drinkabilitynotes
a
poor
example
of
the
style
not
recommended
the
mouthfeel
good
but
the
aftertaste
is
slightly
astringent
that
fades
somewhat
over
time
not
a
bad
pils
good
for
a
warm
day

2oz
bottle
pours
a
golden
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
malted
grain
with
some
spicy
german
hops
the
taste
is
smooth
with
some
malt
up
front
with
a
nice
little
bite
from
the
spicy
hops
in
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
pils
that
is
highly
drinkable
when
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
i
will
definately
pick
up
again
recommended
if
you
want
to
go
to
town
d
of
course
you
could
drink
50
of
these
in
a
row
soft
yellow
color
maybe
a
shade
darker
than
i
expected
this
is
actually
a
very
mellow
pilsener
but
it
somehow
works
substantial
cherrylike
fruit
flavor
sort
of
rich
and
buttery
with
just
enough
bitterness
to
give
it
an
edge
roundish
mouthfeel
nothing
watery
here
maybe
a
little
sticky
on
the
aftertaste
but
a
very
nice
beer
overall
it
is
a
very
straightforward
beer
not
too
much
to
say
really
a
well
designed
pilsner
but
nothing
too
special
there
are
much
better
pilsners
out
there
in
the
same
price
class
pored
from
bottle
to
tumbler
at
45
degrees
pale
is
certainly
what
this
beer
looked
like
but
pretty
with
its
big
fluffy
white
head
that
lasted
a
right
long
time
good
lacing
beer
smelled
like
dough
and
had
a
slighly
sweet
taste
it
was
a
good
beer
and
i
think
i
would
buy
again
i
drank
this
out
of
one
of
those
5liter
minikegs
when
it
was
poured
it
piled
up
a
big
fluffy
head
that
stuck
around
a
good
while
the
aroma
had
just
a
hint
of
spicy
hoppiness
but
was
dominated
by
the
malts
especially
munich
malt
which
always
reminds
me
of
matzo
or
saltine
crackersjust
a
wee
bit
toasty
flavor
was
also
more
maltysweet
and
bready
than
hoppy
the
hops
shone
through
at
the
finish
leaving
a
brisk
dryness
to
offset
the
full
malty
body
as
they
should
this
is
a
good
solid
centralgerman
lager
not
as
overtly
hoppy
as
a
brash
bohemian
pilsener
but
very
easy
to
drink
i
find
that
i
do
not
mind
that
there
is
more
left
in
my
minikeg
mouthfeel
was
somewhat
tingley
due
to
the
alcohol
and
moderate
carbonation
light
to
medium
bodied
im
glad
i
tried
this
one
but
i
will
not
return
pours
a
clear
goldenyellow
with
a
giant
white
foamy
head
the
smell
is
alittle
weak
with
only
hints
of
floral
and
sweet
malt
present
the
taste
is
very
crisp
with
an
intial
hop
bite
that
fades
to
a
malt
sweetness
with
floral
earthy
flavors
the
mf
is
light
with
all
the
flavors
mixing
well
a
very
good
pils
that
could
make
this
a
summer
everyday
beer
taste
is
much
the
same
lightly
sour
pale
malt
but
a
more
strident
presence
of
noble
hops
actually
nicely
balanced
tilting
more
toward
the
hops
more
so
as
it
warms
if
you
like
noble
hops
this
beers
for
you
hops
give
a
cleaness
to
the
beer
light
a
crisp
hop
dominant
in
finish
and
aftertaste
nice
pils
here
lovely
for
the
georgia
heat
the
beer
is
quite
cold
which
is
just
what
i
was
looking
for
on
this
muggy
hot
summer
afternoon
a
nice
sharp
lightly
herbal
hop
note
is
evident
from
the
get
go
the
crisp
hoppy
bitterness
carries
through
to
a
lightly
lingering
finish
grassy
grain
notes
linger
with
a
touch
of
toasted
grain
and
just
a
hint
of
malt
sweetness
all
of
these
really
just
add
a
subtle
counterpoint
to
the
crisp
herbal
with
even
a
touch
of
lemon
zest
hop
character
though
this
is
certainly
not
the
best
pilsner
out
there
but
it
certainly
hits
the
spot
today
and
is
in
fact
a
tasty
example
of
the
style
drinkability
is
very
high
a
very
nice
and
refreshing
beer
its
whole
is
better
then
the
sum
of
its
parts
drinkability
looks
really
do
deceive
this
one
of
those
beers
that
looks
a
lot
better
than
it
tastes
more
like
your
typical
euro
lager
than
a
german
pils
missing
that
tell
tale
saaz
hop
bitterness
and
crispness
way
to
sweet
for
me
i
guess
it
could
be
an
easy
drinker
if
you
like
euro
lagers
but
ill
pass
on
eku
pils
there
are
better
german
pils
out
there
see
prima
pils
tuppers
hop
pocket
pils
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
bit
tart
after
the
swallow
but
generally
clean
and
refreshing
a
well
constructed
pils
that
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
drinkability
while
the
flavor
profile
is
a
bit
lacking
this
is
a
clean
and
refreshing
beer
mouthfeel
key
for
any
pils
is
the
refreshing
and
crisp
flavor
in
the
beer
there
was
plenty
of
gthat
in
this
beer
along
with
a
little
uncharacteristic
sweetness
definitely
drinkable
in
the
sense
that
its
not
very
heavy
and
wont
weigh
you
down
on
the
other
hand
i
thought
it
lacked
in
flavor
and
was
blander
than
other
versions
of
this
style
and
so
if
i
wanted
a
session
pilsner
id
go
with
one
of
those
instead
d
not
my
favorite
european
pils
very
sugary
sweet
with
little
hop
character
or
presence
will
not
be
having
this
one
again
the
body
is
light
and
sharply
carbonated
fairly
dry
with
only
touch
of
sweet
up
front
pretty
easy
to
put
down
one
very
nice
pils
im
actually
quite
taken
with
it
and
will
venture
the
opportunity
to
grab
this
from
the
shelf
more
often
when
in
the
mood
for
a
good
pilsner
last
swigs
i
am
spoiled
living
so
close
to
vicry
and
getting
their
prima
overall
a
well
done
easy
pils
pretty
much
a
middle
of
the
road
beer
that
walks
a
fine
line
between
being
ok
and
being
too
sweet
this
bottle
was
part
of
a
german
beer
hall
tour
sampler
pack
i
received
for
christmas
from
my
dad
eku
pils
is
a
traditional
tasting
german
pilsner
well
balanced
and
close
to
exceptional
in
taste
enjoyed
at
my
favoite
local
german
bar
after
passing
up
on
this
one
for
quite
a
while
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
when
finally
trying
it
very
refreshing
and
clean
though
normal
in
flavor
profile
noble
hop
aromas
were
fresh
and
bold
for
a
pilsner
earthy
and
lightly
malty
also
flavors
are
moderately
sweet
bready
and
slightly
grainy
hops
provide
more
than
just
bitteringa
good
hop
flavor
with
no
lightstriken
qualities
qute
bohemian
in
quality
body
is
smooth
and
creamy
finishes
lightly
bitter
grainy
yet
clean
great
for
washing
down
the
brats
and
sauerkraut
overall
impression
trying
not
to
slam
this
beer
as
im
afraid
its
a
bit
old
but
no
date
on
the
bottle
so
fair
game
ill
have
to
try
another
later
and
confirm
or
correct
these
low
numbers
poured
from
a
12

bottle
into
a

clear

with
a
thick

though
it
disabated
rapidly
pretty
faint
bouquet
slightly
floral
crisp
taste
grany
but
decently
balanced
not
exactly
aw
inspiring
but
a
good
example
of
a
pilsner
i
suppose
that
is
one
way
of
saying
good
but
standard
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
soft
but
slighly
metalic
drinkability
like
stated
above
this
would
be
a
good
beer
on
summer
afternoon
it
is
like
an
american
macro
beer
with
a
backbone
although
frankly
if
that
backbone
werent
there
id
have
been
disappointed
with
this

thanks
to
mtanji
for
the
sample
i
thought
i
would
like
this
beer
more
when
i
saw
its
nice
rich
yellow
color
and
the
thick
head
it
produced
while
the
hoppy
aftertaste
is
unmistakably
potent
i
found
it
that
after
a
few
the
aftertaste
became
metallic
like
this
beer
was
pretty
grainy
too
making
its
drinkability

almost
buttery
a
slight
hops
bitterness
comes
through
but
was
not
overpowering
finish
is
somewhat
thin
smooth
as
opposed
to
crisp
like
other
pilsners
ive
had
but
this
was
enjoyable
nevertheless
very
refreshing
nice
for
the
tucson
summer
no
offflavors
or
anything
disagreeable
but
not
enough
to
make
me
want
another
this
beer
promised
a
lot
but
didnt
deliver
very
clear
golden
yellow
when
served
it
had
a
slight
perfumey
aroma
which
intrigued
but
when
i
tried
to
follow
it
up
when
drinking
well
it
was
missing
my
notes
say
not
much
taste
the
mouthfeel
was
good
lowmedium
with
a
nice
soft
crispness
it
was
just
not
a
lot
of
taste
at
all
would
try
to
have
again
see
if
i
get
a
serving
with
some
taste
next
time
i
felt
this
was
one
of
the
more
highly
hopped
pilsners
ive
had
in
the
past
still
the
grassy
malt
seemed
to
be
the
prevalent
flavor
here
ive
been
drinking
this
for
a
day
or
so
now
and
its
proving
to
be
a
worthy
session
beer
an
average
pilsner
from
the
eku
people
on
the
hoppy
side
of
pilsners
and
hopefully
the
keg
cans
a
bit
old
so
that
this
one
will
be
even
better
next
time
though
it
doesnt
stand
up
with
its
big
brother
eisbocks
id
probably
have
another
one
in
the
hot
summertime
i
could
quaff
this
gem
all
night
long
a
session
beer
for
sure
dn
refreshing
easy
to
drink
because
it
doesnt
demand
anything
at
all
to
grab
your
attention
this
beer
would
be
perfect
picnic
fodder
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
nice
slightly
malty
scent
with
a
bit
of
dry
skunky
aroma
the
taste
is
average
it
has
a
crisp
bitter
flavor
with
a
dry
yet
weak
finish
it
has
no
malt
character
but
does
reveal
some
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
a
boat
load
of
carbonation
this
is
a
hard
drinker
i
dont
care
for
the
taste
at
all
it
has
a
nasty
stale
aftertaste
its
one
and
done
for
me
the
first
bottle
i
had
wont
be
the
last
a
nice
smooth
refrshing
beer
flavor
is
good
and
beer
feels
crisp
in
the
mouth
very
clear
and
pale
yellow
in
color
decent
carbonation
with
a
very
lively
head
of
white
foam
the
aroma
gives
off
some
pungently
sweet
graininess
and
a
hoppy
citrus
sweet
and
light
in
flavor
with
a
soft
hop
bite
this
is
a
very
clean
pilsner
with
a
lemony
crisp
character
and
a
nice
smoothness
a
first
rate
pilsner
nice
straw
pilsener
colored
with
a
fluffy
white
head
bready
and
malty
aromas
with
a
good
amount
of
hops
present
beautifully
crisp
and
flavorful
one
of
the
better
pilseners
ive
tasted
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
on
this
one
i
think
ive
found
a
staple
for
myself
and
i
thought
victorys
prima
pils
was
good
this
beer
had
a
body
with
some
depth
for
a
pils
not
weak
at
all
very
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
several
of
these
can
be
easily
consumed
without
getting
bored
pours
with
a
clean
white
head
settling
over
clear
light
goldenyellowish
liquid
the
nose
is
soft
and
light
maltiness
with
a
pinch
of
delicate
flowery
hoppiness
the
taste
is
a
tad
salty
at
first
then
a
clean
sparse
malt
flavor
shows
up
followed
by
quite
adequate
read
nice
and
bitter
hoppiness
nicely
balanced
finishes
light
dry
and
extremely
drinkable
makes
for
one
great
hot
weather
session
lager
absolutely
transparent
bright
gold
color
white
marginal
head
with
some
sticky
large
bubbles
downward
falling

good
aroma
grape
skins
hop
some
honey
laden
with

malt
is
straightforward
but
ample
lightly
sweet
and
maple
in
impression
nice
carbonation
sprightly
but
not
overdone
the
hops
shine
peppery
and
crisp
and
excellent
in
the
attenuation
department
nutty
bittering
in
the
aftertaste
as
well
good
finish
this
is
one
of
the
hoppier
pilsners
ive
had
if
it
would
keep
id
stock
it
for
those
occasions
when
you
want
a
crisply
bitter
drinkable
beer
without
the
giant
north
american
hop
characteristics
bright
white
head
held
out
for
a
minute
and
then
faded
to
a
film
leaving
a
ring
of
lace
as
it
went
clear
light
gold
colored
beer
smells
like
a
crisp
and
fresh
beer
almost
no
flavor
like
a
light
macro
i
cant
pick
out
a
damn
thing
in
the
taste
although
it
is
pleasant
not
much
in
the
taste
department
but
atleast
its
clean
light
body
but
not
watery
appearance
crystal
clear
straw
tinted
golden
witha
nice
bubbly
white
head
leaves
very
nice
webbed
lacing
in
full
patches
aroma
some
lemongrass
sweetness
grainy
with
hallertau
hops
present
to
balance
the
sweetness
a
very
nice
crisply
balanced
brew
so
far
taste
pleasantly
hoppy
distinct
european
hops
with
a
biscuit
malt
character
much
more
flavor
than
i
was
expecting
simple
but
very
tasty
mouthfeel
light
to
medium
in
body
with
a
very
smooth
natural
carbonation
everything
an
american
light
lager
will
never
accomplish
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
consume
definitely
a
session
brew
meant
to
be
drank
a
few
at
a
sitting
pours
a
translucent
golden
hue
with
a
large
foamy
head
that
quickly
dissipates
an
astringent
aroma
with
a
hint
of
citrus
and
hop
essence
tastes
like
a
standard
pilsner
at
first
but
the
aftertaste
is
really
something
dry
lightly
tart
lemony
faintly
hoppy
just
overall
very
busy
i
liked
this
from
the
first
sip
and
its
growing
on
me
even
more
damn
i
wish
id
bought
more
than
one
fascinating
finish
leaves
a
very
noticeable
immediate
hop
bitterness
but
you
can
suck
the
aftertaste
out
of
the
crevaces
in
your
mouth
for
minutes
and
minutes
after
youre
done
with
this
beer
to
a
puckering
bitter
end
or
is
it
the
end
tasted
blind
again

with
czechvar
and
urquell
stylistically
eku
is
identical
to
czechvar
only
more
lively
urquell
continues
to
demonstrate
its
bohemian
typicity
at
the
very
highest
level
of
quality
something
i
have
to
prove
again
and
again
to
my
skepticself
i
had
this
on
tap
at
a
german
bierstube
in
moscow
it
came
out
in
a
helles
glass
clear
gold
with
a
2
5
finger
contoured
head
that
stuck
around
a
while
and
left
very
nice
lace
most
of
the
way
down
the
glass
the
nose
was
very
mild
almost
imperceptible
the
mouth
was
prickly
and
light
my
tastebuds
were
pleased
by
the
nice
balance
between
the
malty
start
and
the
hoppy
finish
the
aftertaste
is
crisp
bitter
with
an
amazing
extra
hoppy
kick
in
the
car
15
minutes
after
i
finished
the
glass
this
is
a
good
session
beer
and
a
fine
example
of
the
style
albeit
on
the
mild
side
very
light
and
pale
golden
looks
more
like
grape
juice
than
a
pilsner
clarity
is
fine
small
bubbly
white
head
leaves
sparse
lace
nice
pils
maltiness
on
the
nose
spattered
with
floral
and
spicy
hop
notes
soft
malt
tones
mix
with
some
bitter
hoppiness
and
peppery
spice
notes
all
in
all
this
combo
of
flavors
strikes
me
as
pretty
average
the
mouthfeel
is
nicely
carbonated
body
about
medium
not
too
bad
not
too
good
this
beer
is
fairly
crappy
and
generic
it
pours
a
boring
yellow
color
with
little
head
and
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
skunky
with
possibly
a
hint
of
malts
the
flavor
is
much
like
the
aroma
being
a
skunky
bland
pilsner
i
really
didnt
care
much
for
it
but
luckily
it
was
pretty
cheap
this
pils
poured
a
clear
golden
color
with
white
foam
that
left
lace
the
carbonation
action
was
good
the
smell
was
malt
and
biscuit
a
nice
persistent
aroma
the
taste
was
malty
and
biscuity
with
some
floral
hops
and
mild
bitter
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
and
crisp
and
relatively
clean
the
body
and
carbonation
feel
were
medium
this
was
a
good
german
pils
pours
a
big
crisp
white
head
on
a
crystal
yellow
base
aroma
is
immediately
of
spicy
hoppiness
initial
flavor
is
milder
than
expected
from
the
spicy
aroma
is
pretty
light
in
body
with
some
decent
malt
body
a
generous
for
the
style
hop
bitterness
is
clearly
evident
unlike
in
its
descendant
american
pilsners
finishing
with
just
a
touch
of
spicy
flavor
extremely
refreshing
and
light
and
easy
to
gulp
while
still
holding
a
lot
of
interesting
flavor
revisited
this
beer
and
while
a
great
pilsner
not
quite
what
i
had
rated
it
the
first
time
122203
crystal
clear
light
gold
body
topped
by
a
white
head
the
head
was
moderate
and
shortlived
leaving
a
thin
layer
of
white
that
left
small
deposits
of
lace
this
beer
has
a
definite
oily
look
to
it
like
a
heaviness
the
longneck
brown
bottle
used
for
this
beer
could
not
be
responsible
for
the
light
skunkiness
of
the
smell
when
the
bottle
was
opened
so
it
must
be
that
the
hopping
is
what
is
sensed
here
the
nose
is
mostly
of
grassy
notes
and
hay
the
flavor
pattern
is
mostly
from
the
hops
fairly
bitter
and
somewhat
floral
an
interesting
pils
flavor
to
be
sure
the
feel
is
moderate
with
strong
crispness
in
the
finish
long
biting
aftertaste
eku
pils
i
was
thinking
that
this
was
the
big
time
octane
eku
but
thankfully
it
was
not
as
i
had
to
drive
golden
color
that
is
typical
of
the
style
with
a
nice
white
head
that
was
extremely
long
lasting
with
terrific
lacing
clean
light
aroma
but
with
a
little
skunk
the
skunk
in
the
nose
also
shows
up
in
the
taste
but
it
is
not
overwhelming
light
malting
and
a
decent
kick
of
hops
lingers
toward
the
end
nice
light
bodied
and
flavorful
poured
a
straw
color
with
a
nice
blooming
head
in
my
pilsner
glassmelled
of
bread
mostly
nice
balanced
taste
to
this
beer
breadlike
at
the
start
but
a
good
dryhoppy
ending
really
good
pilsner
i
would
recommend
people
to
try
this
oneeally
if
they
like
tis
style
of
beer
a
good
pils
but
not
an
outstanding
one
pours
out
to
the
usual
golden
color
of
the
style
but
slightly
darker
than
the
norm
puffy
white
head
that
settles
quickly
aroma
is
that
of
bread
dough
and
light
hops
taste
is
refreshing
with
a
nice
bit
of
hops
on
the
finish
but
nothing
overwhelming
or
exciting
a
pristine
pils
the
archetypal
lagerpils
color
on
the
pour
a
lucent
gold
the
head
brilliant
white
frothy
and
mountainous
in
size
after
dissipating
it
leaves
a
fine
covering
sheet
of
lace
typical
all
malt
nose
that
is
also
fresh
and
clean
the
start
sweetly
malt
the
top
skinny
the
finish
masterfully
hopped
minimally
acidic
quite
dry
and
an
average
beer
at
best
distinct
aroma
of
mall
pretzels
and
lemonade
from
a
tin
sturdy
malt
backs
a
nice
and
long
steely
hop
finish
and
makes
for
a
quality
even
brew
excellent
german
pils
well
carbonated
yet
smooth
and
refreshing
and
drainable
the
definition
of
a
session
beer
youll
be
tasting
hops
for
hours
this
is
very
hoppy
pils
not
bad
not
what
i
like
but
not
bad
light
beer
but
not
watery
very
good
very
drinkable
not
too
big
on
pilsners
but
this
one
is
delish
i
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
smooth
crisp
and
delightful
wasnt
immediately
impressed
with
the
look
and
smell
of
this
pilsner
but
once
i
started
drinking
it
improved
greatly
lots
of
taste
for
a
beer
that
on
the
surface
doesnt
appear
much
better
than
a
bud
light
will
definitely
drink
again
if
i
see
it
on
the
menu
very
impressive
true
pilsner
from
left
hand
tasty
and
easy
to
drink
what
more
to
you
want
from
the
styletwo
thumbs
way
up
prost
ive
had
this
from
tap
several
times
it
tastes
somewhere
between
a
pa
and
a
pils
and
it
works
really
well
its
refreshing
and
full
flavored
try
it
rather
unique
for
an
american
pilsner
being
that
it
is
not
pasteurized
it
does
give
it
a
fresh
flavor
but
its
relatively
iffy
because
its
not
that
full
flavored
of
a
beer
i
had
this
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
color
was
a
strawgold
transparent
just
the
look
you
want
from
a
pilsner
i
didnt
get
the
fruit
flavors
that
others
have
spoken
of
in
here
found
it
a
bit
watery
nose
is
nothing
of
note
mouthfeel
wasnt
too
heavy
not
a
ton
of

5
im
still
sure
this
is
a
no

very
refreshing
for
a
pilsner
goes
down
faster
than
water
pilsners
tend
to
bore
a
lot
of
people
but
this
one
is
perfect
to
have
on
a
hot
summer
day
light
and
easy
to
drink
plenty
of
flavor
despite
a
lowish
alcohol

and

i
was
not

that
this
was
an
excellent
beer

stronger
than
the

direction
they
have
taken
their
beers

etc
i
hope
they
move
back
to
the
solid
beers
with
better
flavor
melding
than
their
current
lineup
of
beers
with
sharpedged
and
not
that
enjoyable
flavors
polestar
pilsner
is
one
of
left
hands
best
brews
for
sure
overall
one
of
the
few
us
brewed
pilsners
to
taste
like
a
pilsner
and
not
a
skewed
ale
the
disparity
of
reviews
was
surprising
i
get
to
drink
a
fare
amount
of
beer
around
the
world
and
this
one
led
me
to
register
the
brewers
deserve
a
pat
on
the
back
for
crafting
something
very
worthy
of
drinking
this
one
will
go
on
my
list
o
a
stellar
pilsner
to
rival
the
great
czech
offerings
brilliant
amber
gold
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
good
head
retention
crisp
slightly
bitter
bread
malt
and
subtle
herby
hop
flavours
dry
and
slightly
bitter
finish
a
very
good
pilsner
overall
a
nice
pils
the
styles
just
not
for
me
o
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
offering
o
would
try
again
after
reading
reviews
possibly
a
bit
of
an
older
bottle
that
wasnt
treated
too
well
before
i
purchased
it
as
good
a
pilsner
gets
prominent
saaz
on
the
palate
dry
drinkable
nice
balancing
malt
in
there
too
great
balance
of
flavorful
yet
drinkable
one
of
the
better
european
style
pilsners
on
the
market
from
american
brewers
very
light
in
color
with
a
white
head
about
a
finger
in
size
a
almost
sweet
start
with
a
strong
yeasty
finish
leaves
the
tongue
nice
and
clean
and
wanting
more
im
not
usually
much
of
a
pilsner
fan
but
i
really
enjoy
this
one
by
left
hand
i
will
definitely
get
it
again
i
think
this
would
be
a
great
bridge
beer
to
get
a
budweiser
or
miller
fan
into
craft
brewing
i
plan
on
introducing
my
dad
to
it
the
next
time
we
cook
out
together
pilsners
will
never
win
the
ba
top
250
but
if
i
had
to
pick
a
good
one
this
is
certainly
a
favorite
overall
doesnt
live
up
to
the
higher
reviews
in
my
opinion
its
a
little
too
grassyadjunct
tasting
to
be
a
world
class
pils
i
found
myself
enjoying
this
one
considerably
its
light
enough
to
enjoy
multiple
in
one
sitting
yet
packs
enough
flavor
to
keep
you
interested
only
if
just
definitely
worth
consideration
overall
this
is
a
good
drinker
made
very
well
and
worth
picking
over
some
of
the
german
imports
if
you
can
get
it
at
a
good
price
otherwise
i
miss
the
good
melanoidin
malts
that
the
better
german
labels
will
have
i
found
this
for
1
29
at
belmont
party
supply
for
that
price
i
frankly
wasnt
expecting
much
it
pours
an
attractive
golden
color
with
fine
bubbles
swimming
frantically
to
the
top
the
medium
head
shows
very
good
retention
smell
is
somewhat
fruity
with
biscuit
and
mild
hop
aromas
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
for
a
pilsner
but
still
offers
a
nice
biscuit
flavor
mouthfeel
is
somewhat
thin
with
carbonation
on
the
lower
end
of
the
spectrum
overall
this
beer
tastes
fresh
complex
for
a
pilsner
and
remarkably
balanced
it
would
make
a
great
session
beer
im
revisiting
this
after
trying
it
once
before
and
being
blown
away
unfortunately
doesnt
live
up
to
my
memory
of
it
nevertheless
a
solid
gooddrinking
quaffer
that
deserves
a
better
rating
than
it
gets
here
when
i
drank
it
before
i
remember
a
rather
distinct
almost
sweet
creamy
taste
and
feel
especially
for
a
pilsner
but
i
dont
detect
that
now
i
wonder
if
this
is
a
bit
past
prime
scent
is
floral
and
the
taste
is
pretty
middle
of
the
road
slightly
bitter
pilsner
style
i
drank
it
first
in
90
degree
weather
and
it
was
perfect
then
im
gonna
try
this
again
in
july
and
see
what
i
think
not
the
biggest
fan
of
pulsners
but
this
is
one
to
have
o
i
had
this
beer
years
ago
and
wrote
it
off
completely
i
ordered
a
bottle
of
it
at
a
bar
and
it
tasted
skunky
and
stale
since
then
ive
passed
it
over
on
store
shelves
countless
times
holy
christ
what
a
mistake
i
never
realized
polestar
had
this
type
of
game
this
is
right
up
there
with
the
best
americanmade
pilsners
and
it
could
challenge
the
best
imports
too
goes
to
show
you
how
much
of
a
difference
beer
freshness
can
make
dont
know
how
old
this
bottle
is
though
o
wish
i
could
find
this
in
6ers
or
12ers
as
this
is
an
excellent
pilsener
lots
of
flavor
yet
stil
refreshing
highly
recommend
this
beer
the
taste
is
a
bit
bolder
in
hops
which
creep
up
after
the
grainy
and
sweetness
tickle
the
tongue
dry
at
the
finish
this
is
an
ideal
pilsener
for
a
hot
humid
day
like
today
i
could
drink
several
of
them
fairly
bitter
and
dry
but
theres
enough
malt
sweetness
early
to
keep
my
interest
carbonation
is
off
wonder
about
the
age
on
this
one
pours
faded
yellow
with
a
finger
of
white
foam
that
fell
pretty
fast
but
left
a
thin
skin
on
top
and
some
good
lace
perfect
clarity
nose
is
pilsner
all
the
way
yeasty
and
dank
a
touch
of
lemon
and
some
fresh
cut
grass
some
spice
on
a
good
light
malt
a
little
bit
of
a
mineral
quality
too
taste
is
light
biscuit
and
floral
hops
grassy
with
a
touch
of
bitter
body
is
soft
and
smooth
the
malt
is
airy
and
light
really
an
outstanding
pils
that
isnt
too
bitter
and
offers
a
graceful
malt
through
out
the
drink
finished
dry
with
a
delicate
texture
a
touch
bitter
and
a
kiss
of
honey
sweetness
well
done
you
could
happily
drink
this
beer
all
day
overall
left
hand
does
no
wrong
in
my
opinion
and
polestar
certainly
didnt
try
to
convince
me
otherwise
not
my
favorite
of
their
brews
but
i
would
happily
drink
it
at
a
cookout
very
refreshing
and
has
a
nice
complexity
to
tease
your
palate
overall
an
enjoyable
german
pilsner
styled
beer
easy
drinking
and
very
enjoyable
with
a
little
hops
to
it
too
oi
like
my
pilseners
to
be
chalkdry
and
sharp
with
lots
of
cracker
and
biscuit
but
this
pils
did
not
fit
that
bill
it
has
too
much
sweetness
and
fruit
flavor
nevertheless
it
is
a
goodlooking
brew
and
the
mouthfeel
is
spoton
for
the
style
i
have
tried
it
twice
now
with
a
gap
of
eight
months
in
between
tastings
with
consistent
tasting
notes
flavors
of
light
grains
minerals
straw
grassy
hops
all
in
all
a
light
body
with
some
crisp
penetrating
hops
and
a
dry
finish
better
than
a
typical
pilsner
pour
with
a
page
golden
body
lively
carbonation
streamers
full
of
tiny
bubbles
and
a
two
finger
thick
craggy
head
the
smell
was
flowery
grassy
and
had
a
hint
of
cooked
corn
in
it
the
taste
was
a
mixture
of
simple
sweetness
with
a
lemony
and
spicy
hop
presence
easy
to
drink
due
to
a
light
aired
out
body
and
clean
lemon
drop
like
finish
i
just
wanted
a
lighter
diversion
this
week
from
the
usual
ales
i
drink
and
this
was
just
what
i
expected
nothing
spectacular
but
who
buys
a
pils
expecting
that
i
dunno
this
is
really
only
a
left
hand
offering
that
i
think
would
be
a
repeat
drink
in
the
summer
months
at
best
try
this
one
folks
o
for
a
beer
that
says
its
a
malt
liquor
it
sure
has
some
flavor
to
it
very
good
beer
more
like
a
summer
time
session
never
have
been
disappointed
by
a
brew
from
left
hand
never
seen
a
color
so
pale
before
but
its
unique
and
doesnt
indicate
a
lack
of
flavor
at
all
o
a
very
good
pilsner
well
done
from
a
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
smell
is
non
existent
very
clean
after
poor
head
builds
into
around
two
fingers
white
head
taste
is
crisp
but
good
this
would
be
a
good
summer
beer
its
a
good
beer
that
i
would
recommend
for
a
newbie
drinker

o
an
above
average
pilsner
i
wouldnt
recommend
anyone
to
go
search
this
beer
out
but
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
good
pils
this
is
the
place
to
grab
it
i
really
do
like
left
hand
brewery
and
i
do
plan
to
search
out
more
of
their
brews
in
the
near
future
pilsners
are
a
popular
beer
style
the
world
over
and
left
hand
brewing
polestar
pilsner
is
one
of
the
better
i
have
sampled
there
is
a
certain
sulfur
like
quality
in
the
nose
that
some
may
not
like
but
i
found
it
more
than
tolerable
and
the
overall
taste
is
generally
smooth
and
very
drinkable
it
is
a
fine
pilsner
beer
that
most
fans
of
the
style
will
find
to
their
liking

after
the

overall
this
is
a
very
good
pilsner
not
quite
as
bold
as
some
others
i
have
had
however
it
is
nicely
balanced
with
a
good
amount
of
flavor
and
very
smooth
to
drink
as
expected
nicely
enjoyable
offering
this
is
a
nice

sessionable

the
flavor
is

and
the

is

ill
definitely
have
this
again
poured
a
bright
gold
with
an
appealing
white
head
leaving
plenty
of
lacing
and
bubbles
dancing
for
the

overall
earthy
taste
expands
with

mouthfeel
is
a

dry

extremely
refreshing
overall
a
great
lager
pours
a
clear

has
that
great
grainy
pilsner
smell
taste
is
light
grainy
and
slightly
dry
as
to
be
expected
after
taste
is
slightly
chalky
and
dry
light
and
easy
drinking
beer
but
could
be
better
personally
i
was
expecting
something
a
little
better
from
left
hand
overall
refreshing
but
forgettable
o
one
of
the
best
american
pilsners
ive
ever
had
it
wont
win
any
awards
for
complexity
but
every
little
thing
about
it
is
enjoyable
sessionable
and
then
some
poured
into
a
mug
and
i
got
a
very
nice
crystal
clear
beer
with
medium
carbonation
and
a
thick
white
head
that
slowly
dissipates
into
a
thin
layer
of
bubbles
mild
lacing
dresses
the
mug
as
the
beer
moves
around
inside
its
got
the
distinct
german
pilsner
aroma
to
it
very
fresh
and
crisp
lemon
zest
wheat
smells
come
through
its
light
on
the
tongue
some
lemon
flavors
are
present
along
with
some
other
mild
citrus
fruits
like
orange
apple
and
wheat
flavors
are
present
but
i
didnt
pick
up
any
hops
its
goes
down
really
smooth
and
leaves
a
slight
tangy
aftertaste
with
just
a
hint
of
alcohol
o
im
generally
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
but
this
beer
is
very
clean
and
refreshing
the
best
pilsner
ive
had
to
date
id
be
happy
to
have
another
one
of
these
especially
on
a
hot
day
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
solid
creamy
white
head
nice
spicy
hop
presence
in
the
aroma
pale
malty
sweetness
grass
and
mild
lemon
sweet
malt
flavor
and
further
hop
spiciness
herbs
grass
and
grain
add
an
earthy
element
to
compliment
the
spice
not
bad
all
around
a
decent
stab
at
the
style
actually
crisp
and
refreshing
theres
just
something
keeping
it
from
being
really
good
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
with
ease
though
o
enjoyable
beer
that
goes
down
very
easy
good
beer
that
goes
well
with
summer
activities
overall
this
isnt
too
bad
of
a
beer
at
all
i
generally
dont
drink
pilsners
but
this
was
an
exception
i
enjoyed
it
its
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
recommend
it
probably
buy
it
again
but
i
would
absolutely
drink
it
again
ill
still
take
it
over
a
bud
though
the
appearance
is
very
niceclearblondelots
of
tiny
bubblesand
frothy
head
the
smell
is
disappointing
green
bottle
alertalthough
this
ones
coming
out
of
a
brown
the
taste
is
much
betterbut
i
found
it
to
be
a
little
blandnot
enough
breadmalty
taste
and
really
not
much
hopexcept
in
the
smell
im
not
one
who
likes
much
hop
i
would
drink
this
againhoweverim
sure
its
better
with
some
complimentary
foods
on
tap
at
hops
and
pie
and
served
in
a
polestar
pilsner
glass
bright
yellow
appearance
fits
the
bill
smells
like
a
pils
hint
of
earth
minerals
very
subtle
taste
is
refreshing
nice
hint
of
mineral
why
do
i
always
taste
this
in
pils
and
kolsch
crisp
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
no
complaints
on
this
one
with
a
totally
nonexistent
haze
this
beer
makes
a
good
impression
and
the
carbonation
is
crisp
and
cleansing
the
taste
has
that
really
dry
biscuity
flavor
typical
of
pilsners
overall
its
not
bad
its
very
refreshing
but
its
biggest
flaw
is
that
it
just
doesnt
really
stand
out
overall
this
is
a
pretty
typical
pils
there
is
no
depth
but
the
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
and
it
would
be
easy
to
put
a
couple
of
these
away
in
a
night
o
very
good
pilsner
reminds
me
that
summer
is
just
around
the
corner
ill
def
be
picking
up
a
case
of
this
to
have
for
family
gatherings
though
not
one
of
my
preferred
styles
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
one
id
definitely
recommend
for
anyone
who
is
going
to
spend
a
day
out
in
the
sun
a
nice
crisp
pils
pours
that
classic
pale
yellow
clear
with
a
happy
2
inch
white
head
smells
like
german
malts
and
grassy
hops
in
equal
proportion
flavor
is
well
balanced
too
with
the
malt
in
the
front
and
the
hops
in
the
back
i
would
compare
this
to
victorys
prima
pils
in
flavor
and
in
mouthfeel
very
very
refreshing
especially
when
its
ice
cold
quick
mildly
hoppy
light
finish
high
drinkability
not
the
most
exciting
lefthand
brew
but
a
very
quaffable
article
this
will
be
good
on
the
golfcourse
this
summer
overall
a
tasty
session
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
unless
it
was
a
few
dollars
cheaper
a
great
pilsner
beautiful
golden
color
thick
head
and
even
heavy
lacing
smells
mild
as
a
pilsner
should
fresh
grass
slight
mint
some
citrus
tastes
very
good
clean
crisp
the
slight
citrus
is
there
and
crisp
dryish
hops
a
malty
grainy
richness
is
in
the
background
holding
it
all
together
mouthfeel
is
sublime
and
superb
everything
a
great
pilsner
should
be
excellent
work
by
left
hand
highly
recommended
to
fans
of
the
style
of
which
i
am
definitely
one
all
hail
the
mighty
pilsner
o
provided
you
can
get
past
the
smell
or
just
hold
your
nostrils
this
beer
isnt
that
bad
and
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
it
doesnt
have
any
overpowering
flavors
so
it
would
probably
make
a
good
accompaniment
to
food
o
the
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
has
nice
balance
of
between
the
fizz
texture
and
the
full
crisp
hops
with
some
nice
malt
support
o
the
bitterness
works
well
to
balance
out
the
flavours
and
although
it
does
subside
somewhat
in
the
end
its
probably
slightly
too
strong
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
bottled
on
81711
this
pours
a
straw
color
with
a
nice
white
head
which
leaves
a
lacing
the
smell
is
nice
and
crisp
some
grass
a
little
hop
smells
some
bread
malts
the
feel
is
media
to
light
the
taste
is
similar
to
the
smell
crisp
a
little
hop
bite
some
bread
malts
but
there
is
also
a
weird
metallic
taste
overall
id
say
its
a
pretty
average
beer
certainly
not
bad
but
nothing
really
stands
out
except
maybe
the
bottle
heh
o
this
is
a
fantastic
pilsner
right
here
certainly
very
drinkable
and
certainly
something
id
gladly
drink
again
i
wish
there
was
a
little
more
on
the
nose
but
overall
i
feel
like
this
beer
makes
for
a
pretty
solid
experience
this
would
make
a
really
good
session
beer
overall
i
like
this
brewery
for
other
beers
and
this
one
is
kind
of
a
one
trick
horse
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
crisp
white
1
finger
head
that
quickly
settled
to
a
14
finger
cap
there
was
little
to
the
aroma
but
nice
bready
and
slightly
yeasty
notes
with
maybe
some
light
grassy
hops
the
taste
was
crisp
and
clean
nice
malty
balance
over
some
very
earthy
hops
very
clean
and
refreshing
as
a
pilsener
should
be
the
carbonation
was
medium
with
a
lighter
body
this
is
a
good
example
of
what
a
german
pils
should
be
odits
gotta
be
pretty
hard
to
make
a
really
memorable
pilsener
this
one
just
sits
in
the
mediocre
range
not
bad
and
i
bet
lovers
of
the
style
would
enjoy
it
but
for
me
the
single
i
bought
is
more
than
enough
a
modest
beer
easy
to
drink
and
quite
tasty
and
refreshing
the
polestar
pilsner
from
left
hand
my
second
on
xmas
day
is
common
to
most
german
pilsners
out
there
the
beer
pours
a
golden
clear
with
razon
thin
white
head
that
is
leaving
some
lacing
the
smell
and
taste
are
brought
to
you
by
saaz
hops
crisp
with
grain
hints
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
to
light
body
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
american
version
of
a
german
classic
i
drank
2
of
these
in
a
row
and
the
hop
flavor
is
pretty
bitter
with
a
strong
lemon
floral
type
taste
some
very
mild
malt
flavors
in
the
back
ground
the
after
taste
lasts
longer
than
i
would
like
it
to
overall
not
bad
not
great
but
at
almost
10
bucks
for
a
six
pack
i
will
not
be
getting
this
beer
again
this
is
some
tasty
stuff
they
broke
the
mold
when
they
made
this
pilsner
but
it
works
very
well
complex
flavor
yet
crisp
and
clean
brilliant

d
solid
all

a
well
made
pilsner
very
good
worth
getting
my
favorite
pilsner
perfect
for
a
nice
summer
day
crisp
and
dry
just
how
i
like
it
taste
is
very
malt
forward
dry
and
crisp
carbonation
and
hops
come
through
on
the
back
end
the
beer
finishes
more
aggressively
then
it
begins
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
a
clear
golden
color
the
perfect
color
that
a
pilsner
should
be
not
too
light
a
creamy
white
head
sits
on
top
and
dissipates
a
little
what
is
left
is
a
medium
thin
layer
of
bubbles
i
appreciate
this
very
much
as
the
head
never
goes
away
completely
good
sticky
lacing
down
the
glass
smells
of
citrus
lemongrass
and
faded
hops
are
present
the
taste
is
interesting
a
bit
too
lemony
and
herbal
for
me
it
has
a
light
grassy
taste
if
that
makes
sense
a
great
summer
beer
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
very
lageresque
overall
i
think
my
rating
will
be
higher
than
what
i
would
actually
prefer
its
a
complex
beer
but
therein
lies
the
brilliance
of
it
i
wouldnt
want
to
session
this
at
all
but
it
would
make
an
awesome
beer
for
lunch
on
a
spring
or
summer
day
again
i
keep
trying
to
find
faults
with
this
but
when
i
break
down
each
individual
area
its
pretty
good
yet
unique
in
all
of
them
i
probably
wont
try
it
again
though
how
weird
o
this
is
not
a
bad
pilsner
but
it
is
a
tad
watery
i
would
have
also
liked
a
more
assertive
flavor
profile
i
guess
i
expected
a
bit
too
much
overall
for
the
most
part
not
a
very
pilsnertasting
pilsner
at
least
not
so
in
my
opinion
its
not
bad
though
and
somewhat
thoughtprovoking
pours
a
light
golden
color
like
clear
straw
with
thin
lacing
around
the
top
a
light
hoppy
aroma
and
a
delicate
sweetness
to
the
palate
almost
honeylike
this
is
a
light
crisp
refreshing
pilsner
that
doesnt
overwhelm
or
disappoint
big
guys
take
note
pilsners
dont
have
to
be
fizzy
and
flavorless
overall
i
enjoyed
this
beer
its
different
from
the
other
pilsners
ive
tried
due
in
part
to
the
slight
cider
taste
but
even
if
that
werent
present
this
would
still
be
a
very
solid
pilsner
pours

clean
golden

with
thin
cap
of
white
froth

pure
pilsener
with
lightly
twangy
malt
and
some
lemony
and
faintly
grassy

simple
clean
pilsen
malt
taste
leads
with
solid
lemmony
and
lightly
grassy
but
not
over
the
top
hopping
found
in
many
american
pilsener
versions
these
days
lighter
side
of
medium
bodied
crisp
a
good
all
around
refreshing
pils
overall
one
of
the
better
american
interpretations
of
a
german
pilsner
o
this
is
a
soso
pilsener
thats
just
short
a
bit
on
the
hops
add
some
spicy
hops
or
more
of
the
light
grassiness
thats
there
and
youve
got
a
top
notch
beer
conclusion
this
is
another
thoughtful
and
well
crafted
beer
from
left
hand
which
is
earning
my
respect
with
each
new
beer
i
try
i
enjoy
the
laid
back
character
of
this
beer
and
the
soft
but
clean
flavors
it
provides
picked
up
a

of
this

a

the

sour

some
earthy

flavors
a

near

light
easy
drinking
beer
pretty
decent
for
warm
days
but
the
sourness
and
orange
peel
are
a
bit
off
putting
to
me
for
some
reason
mouthfeel
is
actually
a
bit
creamy
which
i
did
not
expect
overall
its
an
alright
beer
but
nothing
special
pours
a
very
hazy

almost
no

minimal

is
light
yeasty
slightly
grassy
lemony

mouthfeel

slightly
carbonated
taste
is
actually
a
bit
bland
some
hops
fairly
yeasty
some
spices
and
a
hint
of
grass
is
noticed
before
finishing
with
a
metallic
touch
if
cold
this
is
a
pretty
refreshing
beer
but
nothing
extremely
exciting
its
not
often
a
pilsner
really
grabs
my
attention
im
glad
i
finally
gave
this
a
shot
ill
be
working
it
into
my
regular
rotation
from
now
on
nice
work
left
hand
this
one
has
some
unique
aspects
that
make
it
a
little
different
from
the
typical
fairly
narrow
style
confines
of
a
pilsner
the
malts
are
super
clean
with
a
biscuit
dough
creaminess
and
i
dont
find
them
to
be
grainy
or
husky
at
all
the
hops
also
lend
a
somewhat
uncommon
biting
bitterness
that
is
somewhere
between
grassy
floral
and
even
piney
in
its
lingering
aspect
i
wouldnt
mind
seeing
more
hop
flavor
and
less
bitterness
it
works
ok
in
the
end
but
i
prefer
my
pilsners
with
more
grainyhusky
malt
flavor
and
a
distinctive
saazy
hop
flavor
with
just
enough
bitterness
for
balance
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
beer
is
as
drinkable
as
any
pilsener
should
be
the
body
is
light
and
refreshing
the
carbonation
is
a
little
fizzy
but
not
overpowering
or
overly
noticeable
nice
effort
though
if
they
tweaked
it
a
bit
more
they
could
reach
the
next
level
overall
impression
ill
give
this
another
shot
in
a
bottle
but
this
growler
provided
a
subpar
pils

will
be
having
many

it
is

a

this

dissipates
quickly
and
leaves
no

the

overall
a

overall
good
o
living
near
eastern
pa
home
of
some
of
the
best
americanbrewed
pilseners
i
was
surprised
and
very
pleased
at
this
entry
from
colorado
siriusly
good
o
a
decent
pils
and
blows
away
macro
stuff
but
a
little
tame
for
me
compared
to
a
prima
drinkable
but
at
the
same
pricepoint
would
take
a
victory
pp
instead
on
most
occasions
the
beer
is
well
crafted
and
has
not
problems
but
i
will
avoid
it
in
the
future
really
easydrinking
pilsner
with
some
nice
hop
character
and
a
little
extra
touch
of
malt
sweetness
for
fullness
and
balance
d
very
drinkable
the
flavors
are
all
smooth
and
well
balanced
while
on
the
lighter
side
it
does
not
feel
empty
or
bland
which
is
great
nice
pilsner
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
had
smell
was
a
bit
dank
but
unique
spiciness
that
makes
this
one
uplifting
and
refreshing
o
seems
like
a
great
pilsener
to
me
though
im
no
expert
on
the
style
a
great
hops
selection
balanced
with
a
nice
malt
profile
and
some
interesting
citrus
flavors
going
on
reviewed
from
one
bottle
out
of
a
mix
and
match
pack
id
go
back
and
grab
a
sixer
of
this
especially
in
the
summer
d
easily
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
a
pilsner
out
there
drinkable
bender
factor
this
pilsner
is
six
pack
worthy
hit
the
spot
refreshing
after
a
day
in
the
blazing
albuquerque
sun
could
see
plenty
of
these
going
down
in
no
time
at
all
and
waking
up
snuggling
a
cactus
beer
is
nothing
super
special
but
it
is
a
pils
and
as
that
it
is
a
good
one
highly
drinkable
and
will
get
it
again
overall
a
delicious
and
refreshing
beer
easy
to
session
and
one
ill
return
to
gladly
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
bit
too
thick
but
perfectly
carbonated
and
the
drinkability
is
rather
good
overall
this
is
just
a
solid
pilsner
out
of
the
united
states
recommended
but
not
anything
worth
chasing
down
i
like
it
i
like
this
beer
but
on
the
take
home
scale
i
would
have
trouble
justifying
the
extra
cost
for
this
pilsner
i
would
pass
it
up
on
the
shelf
pours
clear
pale
golden
in
color
with
a
consistent
white
cap
retention
is
great
on
this
one
though
it
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
the
nose
is
very
grainy
and
grassy
with
lots
of
hop
spiciness
in
the
finish
very
clean
smelling
taste
is
grainy
as
well
lots
of
wheat
and
a
bit
of
a
pepper
spice
after
taste
is
a
little
bitter
and
astringent
in
a
good
way
mouthfeel
is
bubbly
and
crisp
with
a
good
cleansing
feeling
to
it
this
beer
is
just
plain
good
nothing
to
complex
and
mind
blowing
but
well
above
average
it
looks
delicious
and
has
very
good
color
it
smells
delicious
earthy
and
natural
it
taste
like
it
smells
it
feels
clean
good
stuff
the
appearance
is
deep
gold
with
not
much
head
the
the
aroma
is
grassy
hops
and
corn
like
malt
the
taste
is
like
a
pilsner
should
be
with
a
good
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
the
malt
being
almost
bread
like
in
taste
the
palate
is
smooth
this
one
just
gets
you
with
taste
because
you
are
not
expecting
much
by
smelling
it
with
this
typo
i
coin
a
new
term
lragera
portmanteau
of
lager
and
rager
and
a
corruption
of
larger
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
a
cloudy
light
yellow
color
with
just
a
little
bit
of
head
low
carbonation
but
fine
for
the
style
this
beer
has
a
bit
of
the
straw
aftertaste
that
is
similar
to
the
euro
style
with
its
smooth
consistency
and
relatively
low
alcohol
percentage
this
is
a
good
session
lager
a
great
beer
for
the
warm
weather
this
is
a
easy
drinking
great
session
beer
that
i
will
be
sure
to
pick
up
the
next
time
i
host
poker
night
much
better
than
the
massproduced
corn
pilsners
out
there
this
beer
pours
a
semi
hazy
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
a
half
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
a
balance
of
spicy
hops
and
bready
malt
the
taste
is
a
bit
maltier
than
the
aroma
but
i
think
that
is
a
good
thing
there
is
a
nice
bitterness
that
comes
through
in
the
finish
there
is
nothing
on
the
back
end
of
the
taste
though
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
but
there
are
much
better
pilsners
out
there
d
this
was
an
ok
beer
overall
not
one
id
turn
away
but
not
one
i
would
seek
out
it
really
didnt
look
too
pretty
this
paired
with
a
lackluster
aromatic
profile
and
boring
flavors
made
it
just
slightly
above
average
d
decent
brew
good
to
drink
nothing
spectcular
though
the
beer
pours
a
very
clear
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
classic
pilsner
i
get
a
lot
of
lighter
pilsner
malts
as
well
as
some
honey
and
grass
about
what
i
expected
the
flavor
is
pilsner
malt
and
a
lot
of
grassy
hops
fairly
hoppy
for
a
pilsner
medium
bitterness
medium
carbonation
and
medium
mouthfeel
a
nice
easy
drinking
pilsner
md
a
good
pilsner
crisp
and
refreshing
i
wish
there
was
a
bit
more
sweetness
and
hops
though
not
as
good
as
some
of
the
german
imports
i
usually
buy
though
another
shoutout
to
my
brothers
increasingly
improving
beer
selections
this
one
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
halffinger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
light
corn
and
what
seems
like
powdered
sugar
though
admittedly
this
may
be
my
glass
i
just
dont
think
so
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
wheat
flowers
light
greens
and
a
strong
undercurrent
of
vinyl
yowza
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
a
watery
feel
and
a
crisp
finish
overall
were
it
not
for
the
rubbery
bitterness
pervading
this
thing
it
would
be
a
pretty
nice
pils
alas
all
and
all
a
pretty
good
beer
but
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
the
metalic
taste

a
two

light

clean
and
even
another
solid
american
made
pilsener
that
is
tasty
and
highly
drinkable
while
definitely
good
i
could
use
a
bigger
aroma
on
this
beer
that
was
my
main
gripe
also
while
i
didnt
mind
the
bit
of
sweetness
in
the
finish
the
beer
was
not
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
it
could
be
db
balanced
and
enjoyable
it
has
a
nice
hop
profile
that
works
well
with
the
light

and
smooth

definitely
a
beer
worthy
of
sessioning
as
well
the
taste
is
very
crisp
clean
and
bitter
it
is
pretty
straightforeward
but
that
is
what
you
are
looking
for
in
this
style
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
dries
out
your

excellent
beer
to
drink
with
dinner
because
the
hops
contrast
with
the
flavours
of
the
food
pretty
decent
job
left
hand
pours
a
really
nice
and
light
yellow
color
with
some
visible
carbonation
bubbles
nice
fluffy
white
head
the
nose
brings
some
light
floral
and
noble
hops
along
with
a
bit
of
grain
the
taste
is
grainy
with
a
nice
bitterness
level
which
carries
over
and
really
creates
a
nice
mouthfeel
drinks
quite
well
overall
im
a
big
fan
cheers
left
hand
by
far
one
of
the
best
and
most
drinkable
lagers
brewed
in
the
us
today
one
that
gives
the
german
pilsners
a
real
run
for
their
moneyand
not
on
freshness
alone
a
heaping
bowl
of
pipinghot
chili
verde
will
do
the
trick
for
a
pairing
overall
interesting
beer
after
detecting
some
unfamiliar
flavors
in
the
taste
maybe
i
should
sit
down
with
a
full
sixpack
of
this
sometime
and
give
it
another
try
maybe
ill
be
able
to
focus
more
on
how
i
feel
about
it
rather
than
what
it
is
of
course
it
is
a
pilsner
and
has
many
of
the
characteristics
but
it
almost
seems
as
though
it
was
a
wildsour
pils
a
pretty
well
place
pilsner
on
the
side
of
midd
but
with
a0ext
cool
quality
to
it
bright
golden
yellow
with
a
finger
and
a
half
of
head
but
a
sufficient
carbonation
and
steady
bubbles
coming
up
to
the
surface
nose
of
hops
and
bitter
munich
malt
on
the
side
of
a
decent
straw
but
somewhat
one
dimensional
palate
is
that
exactly
bitter
crisp
and
screams
for
a
fatty
salted
meat
quite
german
by
popular
standard
but
would
drink
more
than
one
verdict
polestar
is
a
solid
though
generally
unexciting
german
pilsener
its
not
going
to
set
the
world
on
fire
but
pilsener
fans
looking
for
something
new
shouldnt
be
disappointed
pours
a
very
light
golden
straw
yellow
a
thin
but
sticky
white
head
hangs
around
smell
is
biscuity
goodness
and
a
little
sweet
taste
is
clean
fresh
bready
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
and
a
nice
mildly
hoppy
and
bitter
finish
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
just
right
for
the
style
ridiculously
easy
to
drink
a
very
good
pilsener
opinion
well
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
it
is
a
bit
like
an
ipa
with
pilsner
ingredients
in
the
way
it
comes
across
the
palate
and
maybe
this
can
be
solved
by
simply
having
a
little
more
carbonation
i
expect
a
pilsner
german
style
to
be
a
little
drier
in
the
finish
and
this
one
has
some
sweetness
and
hops
that
never
stop
regardless
i
will
gladly
drink
all
of
the
sixpack
that
i
got
but
i
am
not
sure
how
much
i
will
be
buying
it
going
forward
d
high
the
german
pilsner
is
alive
and
well
lawnmower
session
for
sure
surprisingly
drinkable
the
citrus
really
saves
this
beer
serving
type
bottle
d
could
suck
these
down
one
after
another
overall
a
decent
pilsner
would
be
nice
with
fatty
or
oily
food
so
its
a
good
bar
food
beer
but
not
something
id
reach
for
that
often
drinkability
i
was
so
surprised
by
this
one
as
i
usually
dont
go
for
pilseners
this
one
has
totally
changed
my
outlook
on
this
style
another
worthy
one
from
left
hand
d
overall
left
hand
did
a
pretty
solid
job
with
this
beer
although
its
light
and
mild
in
flavor
its
quite
refreshing
and
very
drinkable
a
little
drier
than
most
too
not
much
sweetness
present
at
any
point
light
in
body
with
a
creamy
feel
from
the
abundant
carbonation
easy
drinking
and
very

the

the

this

has

light

and
is
just
a
pleasure
to
drink
i
enjoyed
this
pilsner
quite
a
bit
d
overall
i
didnt
really
care
for
this
one
and
probably
wouldnt
purchase
again
very
drinkable
sitting
on
the
porch
drinkability
not
a
bad
beer
but
i
have
had
better
pils
living
in
czech
maybe
its
the
spaghetti
i
ate
for
dinner
but
theres
something
starchy
about
this
beer
that
just
doesnt
sit
right
with
me
i
wouldnt
dissuade
someone
from
trying
this
beer
but
i
would
urge
them
to
partake
with
caution
not
impressed
f
finishes
still
partially
sweet
but
mostly
dry
with
that
lingering
bitter
taste
that
doesnt
play
too
well
it
hurts
the
drinkability
of
what
should
be
very
crisp
and
refreshing
although
it
does
have
its
crisp
and

cool
labelgreat
beer
try
it
out
i
am
absolutely
amazed
how
authentic
german
this
americanmade
pilsner
is
d
this
is
a
nicely
made
dry
german
style
pilsner
with
an
emphasis
on
the
hop
character
an
excellent
hop
presence
in
both
aroma
and
flavor
with
a
dry
but
rich
malt
profile
to
back
it
up
this
is
one
to
add
to
the
short
list
of
authentic
and
enjoyable
american
made
pilsners
golden
appearance
with
a
very
white
2
finger
head
good
lacing
and
retention
throughout
slight
grassy
and
lemon
aroma
not
very
strong
flavor
follows
semisweet
up
front
with
some
lemon
flavor
grassy
hops
and
bready
malt
notes
malt
overpowers
the
hops
here
especially
as
you
get
into
the
beer
good
crisp
mouthfeel
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
dry
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
slightly
grainy
bitter
aroma
its
lightly
hopped
and
basic
in
malt
composition
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
flavor
with
just
a
hint
of
munich
malt
sweetness
the
german
hops
provide
adequate
bitterness
its
easy
drinking
with
little
offflavors
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
german
pilsner
style
its
a
bit
less
complex
than
some
authentic
version
but
its
easy
drinking
and
enjoyable
d
so
i
think
this
one
is
pretty
weak
for
left
hand
brewery
not
much
going
on
with
flavor
however
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
could
be
drank
on
a
hot
day
of
fishing
cause
its
kind
of
like
water
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
notes
easy
to
drink
i
just
dont
like
it
poured
a
light
clear
gold
with
decent
head
and
some
lace
patches
on
the
glass
has
an
earthy
breezy
hop
smell
that
is
light
and
non
distinct
taste
is
alright
w
a
decent
pils
malt
taste
along
with
minor
citric
flavor
and
a
little
bit
of
chewiness
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
nice
and
crisp
a
good
summer
beer
to
relax
with
this
is
what
all
of
the
big
macros
need
to
be
no
corn
overtones
here
just
the
nice
bitter
finish
from
the
style
light
body
cleaner
finish
easy
drinking
but
a
couple
and
id
be
looking
for
more
depth
worth
trying
notes
this
is
a
tasty
and
very
drinkable
german
pilsner
cheers
tasteeasy
on
the
palate
and
all
the
way
down
nice
little
display
of
hops
up
front
then
it
fades
back
and
the
mellow
malt
takes
over
slight
lemoncitrus
flavor
hangs
in
the
back
of
the
throat
quite
a
quencher
this
goes
down
so
easy
just
enough
flavor
to
make
it
worth
drinking
i
dont
often
reach
for
pilsners
but
if
youre
looking
for
one
id
recommend
the
polestar
eh
drinks
ok
id
rather
not
however
its
not
a
terribly
crafted
beer
but
im
glad
i
bought
only
one
of
these
mouthfeel
is
mediumlight
with
an
airy
amount
of
carbonation
dvery
easy
to
drink
but
the
phenol
taste
detracts
from
the
beer
itself
and
makes
it
less
enjoyable
with
all
the
better
examples
out
there
i
dont
think
ill
see
this
one
in
my
glass
again
any
time
soon
d
highly
drinkable
im
not
sure
there
is
reason
to
come
back
for
more
of
this
but
its
good
good
beer
and
i
will
be
sure
to
try
it
again
d
very
good
overall
everything
is
in
balance
not
unlike
a
macro
lager
but
without
any
minor
offensive
flavors
d
overall
this
is
a
fairly
average
pilsener
nothing
really
bad
about
it
i
just
wouldnt
pick
this
one
up
as
my
first
choice
a
very
solid
american
brewed
german
pils
beer
when
poured
into
a
glass
it
has
a
very
nice
head
nearly
2
fingers
and
leaves
nice
lacing
as
it
subsides
crystal
clarity
straw
color
aroma
not
much
beyond
some
cereal
flavor
also
bland
and
cereal
finish
leaves
a
hint
of
creaminess
but
nothing
that
lingers
this
is
not
a
beer
made
to
impress
i
guess
it
was
made
as
a
session
beer
or
just
something
you
can
pound
without
the
nuisance
of
tasting
anything
pilsners
can
be
great
but
this
one
seems
happy
with
just
not
being
offensive
given
budmillercoors
or
this
id
drink
it
again
otherwise
itll
be
a
long
time
before
i
bother
with
this
one
again
polestar
is
a
perfect
session
beer
drinkability
is
good
reasonably
priced
and
solid
flavors
but
overall
nothing
to
put
it
up
there
witht
the
best
d
thats
a
tough
question
this
wouldnt
be
the
first
beer
i
reach
for
nor
one
that
i
select
just
when
i
want
to
have
one
beer
to
enjoy
the
taste
but
if
it
was
a
beer
for
later
on
or
all
i
had
sure
so
thats
hard
to
say
really
good
with
conditions
good
color
and
carbonation
forgetable
aroma
mouthfeel
and
drinkablity
overall
light
sweet
and
crisp
a
good
warm
weather
beer
i
have
been
drinking
a
fair
amount
of
this
lately
and
find
it
just
is
perfect
for
the
hot
summer
a
very
refreshing
and
full
flavored
brew
to
sit
and
relax
with
at
the
end
of
course
i
did
the
same
thing
at
times
during
the
winter
also
overall
a
pretty
good
pils
a
weak
flavor
and
just
the
slightest
hint
of
a
metallicmacro
brew
taste
bring
the
score
down
a
little
bleached
white
creamy
looking
microfoam
pours
big
and
then
holds
on
very
well
at
about
half
finger
level
even
the
sticky
lacing
looks
foamy
quite
clear
and
transparent
yelloworange
color
no
visual
match
for
the
head
very
bready
nose
neither
uncooked
nor
too
sour
in
nature
like
a
big
loaf
of
white
bread
the
lemon
peel
about
as
bitter
as
anything
gets
this
said
the
malts
seem
muted
and
submerged
in
general
grassiness
no
real
fruit
scents
to
speak
about
mediumbodied
not
as
lightweight
as
youd
think
while
still
keeping
a
steady
pace
moving
forward
the
fizz
is
pretty
damn
active
and
does
contribute
to
the
overall
weight
bready
and
crusty
pretzellike
with
more
of
a
sourness
here
duh
sourness
is
related
to
taste
not
the
olfactory
sense
but
hey
it
all
makes
sense
in
the
end
grassiness
not
as
biting
though
and
the
lemon
citrus
toned
down
too
touch
of
peach
to
apricot
pit
skin
for
fruit
stays
square
shouldered
through
the
finish
no
wimping
out
at
the
end
not
complex
by
any
measure
but
one
might
guess
that
it
was
made
more
for
hot
weather
chugging
than
contemplation
very
nice
big
2
finger
head
light
golden
color
smells
like
corona
tastes
better
though
good
mouthfeel
just
the
right
amount
of
body
for
a
light
beer
overall
id
say
its
a
decent
summer
beer
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
often
nice
crisp
and
dry
wonderful
light
body
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
but
when
paired
with
food
it
tastes
like
soapy
chemicals
drinkability
a
highly
sessionable
pils
that
i
could
have
in
any
season
this
is
a
little
on
the
sweet
side
another
winner
from
one
of
my
favorite
breweries
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thinner
side
moderate
carbonation
this
beer
pours
a
perfect
look
just
the
right
shade
of
golden
with
a
nice
thick
head
could
not
help
but
notice
the
born
on
date
smudged
it
showed
a
little
over
a
month
ago
then
the
smell
i
smelled
that
smell
before
and
i
cursed
the
day
when
i
first
smelt
it
the
smell
is
a
dead
ringer
for
milwaukees
best
the
beast
the
salty
smell
was
overwhelming
being
hopeful
with
the
looks
i
took
a
drink
the
salty
beast
was
all
over
it
though
i
remember
the
beast
been
over
10
years
to
be
worse
not
smooth
in
the
mouth
or
going
down
after
drinking
the
beer
which
was
good
enough
to
finish
but
it
is
rare
that
i
would
ever
not
finish
a
beer
i
needed
a
drink
of
water
to
kill
the
taste
out
of
my
mouth
assessment
if
you
are
dirt
poor
and
want
to
get
drunk
to
drown
your
worries
drink
something
cheaper
md
damn
good
high
carbonation
and
a
light
body
make
a
drinkable
lager
body
is
light
without
being
airy
12
ounce
bottle
with
bottled
on
dating
printed
on
the
front
label
pours
light
and
clear
golden
uner
a
nice
looking
fine
white
leaving
plenty
of
fine
lace
grassy
is
how
i
would
describe
the
moderatly
pungent
nose
pleasant
easy
drinking
lager
with
wiffs
of
lime
more
grass
with
some
snappy
and
quite
dry
hops
sealing
the
deal
thirst
quenching
crisp
and
dry
respectable
sessioner
nice
for
a
summer
lunch
this
is
about
what
i
expected
although
i
really
didnt
know
for
sure
poured
up
a
nice
pale
straw
colour
with
a
very
large
snow
white
head
that
stayed
in
place
for
about
90
seconds
it
then
subsided
to
about
a
halfinch
blanket
throughout
the
remainder
of
the
drink
it
laced
the
sides
of
the
glass
nicely
smell
was
much
lighter
than
i
though
it
would
be
consisting
mostly
of
a
grassy
smell
with
maybe
a
hint
of
freshly
sliced
apple
hiding
deep
down
taste
is
not
bmc
but
it
is
very
light
and
i
am
unsure
how
best
to
describe
it
there
are
hops
present
but
theyre
very
modest
everything
about
this
beer
is
very
mild
its
quite
refreshing
really
highly
drinkable
imo
and
probably
my
favourite
craft
pilsner
to
date
i
like
victory
prima
but
it
almost
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
this
is
much
more
subtle
and
what
i
think
of
when
i
think
of
pilsner
this
is
probably
the
best
left
hand
beer
that
i
have
tried
so
far
something
i
could
drink
all
day
recommended
for
a
summer
day
bbq
or
just
to
quaff
a
few
at
the
bar
very
clear
golden
color
zero
haze
large
four
finger
head
that
went
quick
kind
of
lemony
smell
with
some
strong
alcoholic
undertones
nice
bitter
taste
thats
very
refreshing
i
think
this
is
pretty
average
compared
to
other
pilsners
ive
had
sort
of
hoppiness
that
leaves
the
mouth
feeling
dry
overall
a
clean
refreshing
pilsner
that
is
good
but
not
great
the
taste
is
on
the
sweet
side
for
a
lager
the
beer
is
quite
smooth
there
isnt
the
prickly
mouthfeel
of
say
a
czech
lager
there
is
some
sweet
malts
throughout
and
lots
of
lemony
citrus
flavors
things
dry
out
a
bit
in
the
finish
and
there
is
some
slightly
drying
hop
bitterness
there
this
is
a
very
light
beer
that
doesnt
distinguish
itself
in
anyway
it
has
a
slight
perfumey
character
not
creamy
at
all
not
mouth
puckering
nor
prickly
overall
sweet
light
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
it
isnt
an
overly
carbonated
pilsner
either
overall
a
good
crisp
and
dry
pils
the
flavor
is
basic
the
texture
is
soft
airy
the
crisp
and
dryness
of
this
beer
is
great
a
good
rendition
of
a
bitburger
if
i
do
say
so
good
job
left
hand
overall
meh
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
while
mowing
the
lawn
or
tailgating
something
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
this
style
so
it
would
take
a
lot
to
make
me
change
that
the
drinkability
here
is
just
ok
a
decent
beer
overall
drinkability
i
enjoy
a
pilsner
just
like
the
next
guy
but
i
must
say
this
one
isnt
doing
anything
spectacular
for
me
not
saying
i
wont
drink
them
but
just
nothing
spectacular
poured
cloudy
with
a
light
yellow
appearance
with
a
good
head
that
went
away
quick
and
slight
lace
almost
no
scent
a
little
of
the
malt
used
not
much
else
slightly
bitter
wash
a
little
thicker
and
a
bit
fruity
in
the
end
well
this
was
about
as
pils
standard
as
it
gets
clean
a
little
bitter
from
the
hops
great
big
malt
taste
with
alcohol
in
the
background
overall
another
wonderful
bottled
pilsner
d
very
drinkable
beer
in
a
drinkable
style
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
if
there
was
it
would
stick
out
overall
not
a
good
beer
for
me
as
i
said
above
its
more
the
style
than
the
beer
if
you
like
this
style
then
this
is
probably
a
good
one
to
try
for
me
one
and
done
only
had
this
one
since
it
was
part
of
a
mix
pack
id
honestly
rather
have
a
bmc
than
a
german
pilsener
overall
nothing
special
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
d
an
enjoyable
beer
but
not
memorable
in
the
slightest
drinkability
decent
beer
in
a
pinch
but
not
something
i
would
venture
to
drink
again
or
a
lot
of
drinkablity
is
this
beers
main
feature
especially
when
combined
with
hearty
and
heavy
food
similar
to
how
certain
wines
blossom
when
paired
with
a
meal
i
feel
that
if
i
had
gotten
a
fresher
bottle
my
experience
with
polestar
would
have
been
better
overall
drink
ability
of
beer
is
above
average
would
be
a
good
substitute
for
a
light
lager
on
a
hot
day
nothing
too
impressive
but
would
drink
again

mouthfeel

light
and
the
carbonation
is
scrubbing
this
would
be
a
good
aperitif
beer
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
touch
of
cloudiness
on
top
sits
a
three
finger
cap
of
white
fluff
that
resembles
melting
styrofoama
nice
amount
of
chunky
lace
is
left
behind
as
it
ever
so
slowly
recedes
the
nose
is
a
bit
understatedmostly
floral
and
subtle
grainy
notes
this
is
pretty
dead
on
the
styleas
far
as
the
pallet
goes
this
is
slightly
sweet
with
just
the
right
touch
of
graininess
and
hop
bitterness
this
has
a
slightly
skunked
finish
that
gives
it
that
traveled
beer
feeling
the
mouthfeel
is
light
with
carbonation
that
is
semi
creamyand
a
drying
finish
a
nice
german
pils
and
i
think
this
could
stand
up
with
the
best
of
them
very
pale
look
for
a
pilsner
more
like
a
wit
than
a
pilsner
cloudy

yellow

pure

on

theres
a
nice
blend
of
floral

and
bready

brings
more
of
the
same
the
bready
and
biscuity
malt
notes
with
a
little
sweet
graininess
as
well
hops
add
some
floral
notes
and
grassiness
im
guessing
saaz
was
at
least
part
of
the
hopping
schedule
good
thirst
quencher
active
carbonation
level
and
medium
stature
to
this
beer
quite
agreeable
overall
a
fairly
nice
cut
at
a
pilsner
but
i
wouldnt
seek
it
out
in
the
summer
heat
blah
what
a
boring
pilsener
pour
was
a
light
gold
with
no
head
and
no
bubbles
aroma
was
almost
nothing
i
blew
my
nose
and
tried
again
nothing
so
its
not
my
allergies
taste
was
a
semi
carbonated
mix
of
corn
grain
and
grass
a
little
biscuit
in
the
aftertaste
very
watery
and
thin
nothing
to
remember
d
the
lightness
and
crispness
would
make
it
a
decent
session
brew
however
for
my
taste
and
money
there
are
better
ones
out
there
drinkability
pilsners
are
not
really
my
thing
and
they
have
to
be
rather
special
to
bowl
me
over
and
this
one
is
about
average
nothing
great
nothing
terrible
a
decent
beer
for
those
who
dont
enjoy
a
more
robust
brew
very
very
drinkable
a
nice
session
beer
d
good
all
around
anytime
drink
the
aroma
reminds
me
of
a
belgian
pale
ale
for
some
odd
reason
with
grassy
hops
the
flavor
lacks
the
dry
biscuit
character
of
most
great
pilsners
and
the
mouthfeel
isnt
as
dry
the
hops
are
also
more
american
with
grapefruit
and
citrus
rind
so
its
a
lot
more
like
an
american
pale
ale
not
a
pils
which
isnt
necessarily
bad
just
different
for
the
style
id
rather
be
tasting
hops
that
nothing
worth
a
try
d
pretty
much
what
i
expected
a
good
pilsner
great
for
mindless
consumption
but
nothing
to
sit
down
and
contemplate
a
sip
reveals
plenty
of
flavor
from
crystal
malts
and
noble
hops
the
aftertaste
is
full
of
satisfying
bitterness
and
the
texture
is
smooth
and
carries
the
taste
well
this
is
a
quality
german
style
pilsner
and
a
good
last
gasp
for
summer
beers
as
we
head
into
the
fall
i
would
say
that
while
it
isnt
fantasticly
complex
it
is
a
good
session
or
crossover
beer
drinkability
is
nice
and
easy
sort
of
like
water
not
the
classic
flavor
or
smell
this
is
still
a
very
good
beer
that
will
refresh
you
better
than
any
macro
after
a
long
day
of
mowing
the
lawn
mouthfeel
is
light
as
it
should
be
with
some
carbonation
this
beer
is
amazingly
drinkable
it
all
goes
down
super
smooth
and
still
maintains
a
great
amount
of
flavor
throughout
drinkability
not
my
favorite
style
but
left
hand
does
it
well
another
solid
offering
this
is
one
of
the
better
pilsners
that
ive
had
the
chance
to
taste
i
typically
find
pilsners
to
be
a
little
bare
in
terms
of
flavor
and
sometimes
a
bit
on
the
watery
side
but
this
one
seems
to
tell
convention
to
shove
it
the
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
but
i
was
quite
happy
that
the
citrus
character
was
accentuated
a
bit
more
than
the
hops
this
easily
makes
the
brew
something
that
i
would
love
to
consume
when
it
gets
too
hot
its
pretty
light
but
the
folks
at
the
left
hand
brewing
co
dont
skimp
out
on
the
flavor
to
make
the
brew
more
drinkable
im
a
big
fan
of
the
pilsner
type
style
and
this
is
quite
a
dissapointment
i
would
probably
buy
this
one
again
if
i
really
needed
a
refreshing
beer
maybe
its
me
but
left
hand
brews
always
leave
me
wanting
a
bit
more
flavor
this
one
is
unoffensive
and
pleasant
enough
and
i
wouldnt
have
a
problem
recommending
it
to
those
who
arent
quite
ready
for
fullfigured
beers
a
friend
of
mine
put
together
a
sampler
and
this
is
the
second
to
last
of
the
batch
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
with
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
rings
of
lacing
behind
in
my
pilsner
glass
its
a
bold
pilsner
malt
flavor
with
a
mild
hop
bite
a
bit
of
hops
present
midway
as
well
a
bit
chalky
and
metallic
in
the
finish
its
a
dry
light
body
that
is
made
a
bit
creamier
with
the
carbonation
its
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
is
pretty
drinkable
it
has
a
classic
style
and
can
be
enjoyed
for
a
bit
dfirst
real
disappointment
with
left
hand
but
on
the
other
hand
this
is
just
not
my
style
of
beer
tried
to
be
objective
nonetheless
picked
this
up
as
part
of
a
boxed
set
of
different
microbrews
poured
a
clean
golden
yellow
with
abundant
head
that
soon
diminished
to
pencil
thin
the
lacing
around
the
glass
stuck
for
the
duration
of
the
beer
real
good
hoppy
aroma
the
flavor
captures
the
typical
pilsner
essence
hoppy
with
a
slight
bite
at
the
end
very
crisp
and
clean
easily
drinkable
this
is
a
relatively
basic
pilsner
not
bad
at
all
one
of
the
better
offerings
of
the
style
nice
light
and
tasty
sessionable
pils
pours
a
very
pale
light
lager
color
looks
about
as
clear
as
bud
light
but
has
a
pure
white
head
that
stays
around
for
almost
the
entire
beer
smell
is
kinda
skunky
with
a
very
light
maltiness
tate
is
average
pretty
standard
lager
overall
its
an
average
beer
i
suppose
d
interesting
take
on
a
pils
i
could
see
myself
having
several
of
these
polestar
pilsner
pours
a
yellow
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
there
is
a
nice
hoppy
aroma
there
is
a
nice
spicy
hop
flavor
with
the
malt
in
the
background
i
wouldnt
call
this
a
traditional
german
pils
but
its
very
nice
overall
i
have
a
feeling
this
can
be
a
great
beer
but
that
tin
taste
just
ruined
it
id
like
to
try
it
on
draught
lively
carbonation
great
mouthfeel
highly
drinkable
on
a
hot
day
as
most
pilsners
are
certainly
one
ill
reach
for
during
the
summer
months
but
there
are
better
pilsners
out
there
light
easy
to
drink
clean
flavors
a
touch
of
grain
there
are
other
pilsners
i
would
choose
before
this
one
but
i
wouldnt
kick
this
one
out
of
bed
surprisingly
a
mouthful
big
biscuity
malt
character
with
the
slightest
essence
of
caramel
is
neatly
finished
by
a
nice
dry
bitterness
crisp
and
clean
with
fantastic
drinkability
d
absolutely
does
what
it
sets
out
to
do
and
tastes
pretty
good
in
the
process
will
pick
up
again
nathaniel
presented
this
to
me
with
a
big
fluffy
bonewhite
head
with
decent
retention
the
color
was
a
pale
yellow
with
nequality
clarity
the
nose
had
a
really
pleasant
saaz
hops
snap
the
mouthfeel
was
thintomedium
with
a
great
saaz
hops
presence
on
the
tongue
the
finish
was
not
as
strong
as
it
had
been
in
the
mouth
but
it
still
evidenced
as
much
hops
as
i
had
experienced
over
the
course
of
a
long
blazingly
hot
day
it
was
a
welcome
experience
this
one
pours
very
clear
dark
straw
color
with
a
moderate
white
head
the
aroma
is
moderately
malty
with
noticeable
spicy
hoppyness
the
flavor
is
a
bit
sweet
and
malty
upfront
with
moderate
bitterness
and
spicy
hop
flavor
emerging
at
the
swallow
the
finish
is
crisp
with
a
bit
of
lingering
hop
body
is
medium
and
moderate
carbonation
overall
a
good
looking
very
tasty
pilsner
picked
up
a
sixer
from
central
market
poured
the
beer
into
a
pint
glass
it
had
a
nice
golden
clear
color
but
the
head
had
no
retention
grainy
malt
aroma
at
first
the
beer
tasted
syrupy
but
finished
dry
not
bad
not
great
the
mouthfeel
was
the
best
thing
in
this
pilsner
it
had
a
nice
fizz
yet
overall
was
pretty
smooth
although
this
is
not
exactly
the
pilsner
i
was
hoping
for
it
was
fairly
drinkable
easy
to
knock
back
mostly
due
to
the
mouthfeel
appears
a
brilliant
light
pale
golden
hue
with
a
large
foamy
white
head
with
each
sip
streaks
of
scattered
lacing
are
left
behind
the
smell
is
nice
spicy
herbal
hops
flowing
with
grassy
and
citrus
notes
galore
lightly
toasted
biscuit
with
honey
malt
sweetness
with
a
touch
of
mineral
water
notes
going
on
as
well
flavor
is
balanced
yet
has
an
assertive
hoppiness
to
it
more
herbal
grass
with
citrus
peels
on
the
palate
with
a
semi
sweet
lightly
toasted
two
row
cereal
malt
flavor
with
hints
of
crackers
with
honey
drizzled
on
it
mouthfeel
has
sturdy
carbonation
with
a
dry
finish
from
the
hop
bitterness
perfect
german
style
pils
drinkability
is
all
day
a
nice
summer
offering
that
i
hope
to
catch
more
of
i
realized
that
the
folks
at
left
hand
know
how
to
brew
lagers
after
trying
their
ofest
this
past
season
it
was
definitely
one
of
my
favorites
i
got
to
try
pours
a
clear
straw
colored
yellow
very
few
bubbles
and
just
an
asymetrical
film
of
foam
on
the
top
of
the
beer
hardly
any
lacing
light
crisp
and
dry
pilsner
malt
wth
a
littl
herbal
hop
aroma
well
blended
the
taste
is
a
simple
medium
malt
with
notes
of
dried
fruit
upfront
but
the
hops
give
just
a
toch
of
grass
and
lemon
very
well
balanced
tasting
pilsner
very
refreshing
and
crisp
palate
hits
the
spot
while
you
wait
for
your
dinner
to
cook
after
a
hard
summer
days
work
pours
a
regular
transparent
straw
color
but
a
decent
white
head
lacing
falls
quick
aroma
is
slight
crisp
hops
taste
is
light
malt
backbone
moreso
than
the
light
hop
crispness
most
importantly
its
not
a
skunky
pils
this
is
a
summer
beer
or
rather
this
is
one
you
reach
for
when
you
are
thirsty
this
beer
makes
you
want
to
wash
the
car
in
shorts
and
flipflops
or
better
yet
get
out
the
chips
and
shuffle
the
cards
i
like
to
think
this
is
what
the
orginal
american
beer
used
to
taste
like
maybe
a
time
machine
this
beer
i
prefer
a
stronger
beer
but
this
one
did
surprise
me
a
solid
beer
and
i
cant
complain
about
that
impressive
body
its
thick
and
smooth
while
maintaining
good
carbonation
soft
malt
is
toasty
with
biscuit
tones
and
a
touch
of
honeycrisp
sweetness
hops
balance
the
malt
with
prominent
bitterness
and
modest
flavor
tart
and
floral
mostly
not
unlike
a
bright
white
wine
touch
of
alcohol
more
sweetness
aroma
is
fairly
strong
malty
with
a
whisper
of
citrus
my
nose
was
a
little
stopped
up
by
hay
fever
but
i
still
got
a
good
whiff
it
pours
a
typical
clear
strawyellow
with
a
thick
white
head
that
dissipates
fairly
quickly
about
average
for
a
pils
flavor
is
a
little
fuller
than
most
pilsners
i
have
tried
with
a
firm
hop
component
and
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
i
prefer
darker
and
more
flavorful
beers
but
this
one
is
fine
by
me
d
a
very
average
and
forgettable
pils
not
bad
but
definitely
not
very
good
the
last
of
my
lh
sampler
pours
a
clear
yellowgold
w
a
thin
white
head
which
dissipates
quickly
leaving
little
rings
of
lacing
behind
in
my
pils
glass
a
sweet
cereal

some
floral
noble
hops
and
a
touch
of
adjunct
twang

w
a

a
bit
of

present
midway
as

and

in
the
finish
a
dry
light
body
made
a
bit
creamier
by
the
ample
level
of
co2
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
quite
drinkable
and
a
decent
rep
of
a
classic
style
on
par
w
any
euromacro
for
sure
dvery
drinkable
american
pilsener
i
would
have
a
few
more
if
possible
thanks
to
pimpp
for
the
sample
what
a
great
beer
i
will
most
assuredly
buy
it
again
good
carbonation
medium
body
leaves
nice
lace
good
drinking
beer
has
a
smoothness
to
it
i
could
do
a
session
i
may
buy
again
follows
style
d
a
good
warm
weather
beer
but
not
my
favorite
style
i
prefer
a
more
pronounced
malt
background
and
pacific
nw
hops
d
a
nice
drinking
beer
good
taste
crisp
light
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
and
nice
slightly
malty
taste
made
it
a
nice
beer
overall
and
very
enjoyable
it
reminded
me
of
pilsner
urquell
a
little
bit
light
to
medium
gold
colored
with
a
lasting
white
head
very
active
carbonation
smell
is
sweet
grainy
malt
simple
but
nice
taste
is
sweet
and
malty
with
very
little
yeasty
flavor
and
a
balancing
bitter
zing
to
it
ends
somewhat
sweet
nice
body
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
simple
and
refreshing
nice
pilsner
and
great
for
a
warm
day
like
today
overall
not
a
bad
pilsner
at
all
nothing
really
earth
shattering
here
but
still
a
very
solid
effort
i
would
most
certainly
not
turn
this
one
down
if
offered
it
again
especially
with
the
warm
weather
approaching
the
taste
is
grassygrainy
a
bit
chalky
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
sweet
with
a
touch
of
bitter
crisp
though
not
a
big
fan
of
the
flatish
metallic
aftertaste
d
good
clean
taste
maybe
a
little
too
much
hops
but
overall
a
decent
beer
d
a
great
session
beer
i
could
have
several
of
these
it
doesnt
wow
me
though
so
its
not
perfect
probably
a
step
down
from
the
prima
pils
class
but
still
a
very
good
americanstyle
german
pilsner
d
good
brew
definately
will
join
my
session
beer
line
up
into
a
pilnser
glass
this
is
a
pale
bright
gold
color
with
a
moderate
but
lasting
head
of
foam
nose
is
sweet
malt
a
little
grassy
hops
and
very
oddly
for
a
pilsner
a
light
fruitiness
nice
flavor
the
fruitiness
i
kept
detecting
in
the
nose
is
not
present
with
lightly
sweet
malt
and
a
moderately
high
bitterness
lots
of
hop
flavor
tending
floral
clean
finish
good
stuff
worth
a
shot
but
not
the
best
depiction
of
the
style
or
sample
from
left
hand
a
clean
very
pale
yellow
beer
has
a
nice
thick
white
head
and
a
nice
bit
of
lace
the
aroma
has
a
light
biscuit
malt
character
with
grassy
and
lemon
notes
the
taste
starts
with
a
light
floral
hop
bite
on
the
tip
of
your
tongue
the
middle
has
plenty
of
easygoing
grassy
and
lemony
notes
flowing
around
and
the
finish
goes
back
to
that
nice
floral
hop
note
quite
refreshing
overall
an
excellent
pilsner
thats
light
and
refreshing
without
being
dull
overall
not
a
fan
of
pilsners
so
i
dont
like
it
too
much
it
is
true
to
style
not
straying
at
all
but
not
my
favorite
of
styles
i
would
rather
have
a
miller
lite
if
i
wanted
a
pilsner
and
i
dont
like
that
either
some
stingy
carbonation
but
not
completely
out
of
line
for
the
style
great
american
pilsener
in
a
more
traditional
style
that
say
prima
pils
drinkability
fairly
accurate
to
style
and
reasonably
refreshing
pretty
good
for
a
pilsner
d
drinkability
was
good
a
touch
dry
and
increased
hopping
adds
some
depth
d
tasty
goes
down
very
easily
not
filing
at
all
mild
kick
very
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
pound
away
several
of
over
the
course
of
an
evening
drinkability
a
decent
domestic
pils
quite
germanic
dont
drink
and
review
even
on
a
subfreezing
day
coming
home
a
bit
hot
and
tired
this
went
down
very
easy
and
i
promptly
went
looking
for
something
similar
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
and
carbonation
appropriate
nothing
spectacular
nothing
to
detract
either
just
right
where
it
should
be
overall
just
a
great
beer
pours
into
a
pilsner
glass
slightly
cloudy
and
golden
starting
with
a
big
fluffy
head
which
dissipates
but
leaves
good
lacing
the
sent
is
slightly
floral
with
a
light
hint
of
lemon
and
some
bready
grains
taste
starts
off
bitter
with
some
light
malts
and
finish
with
a
bit
of
a
hop
bite
the
mouthfeel
is
just
right
for
a
sesionable
beer
and
the
drinkability
is
their
although
the
flavor
is
less
intriguing
then
the
smell
i
got
this
case
from
rick
in
alexandria
after
seeing
it
highly
rated
in
a
nytimes
review
it
pours
slightly
cloudy
pale
gold
lots
of
bubbles
coming
up
the
soft
fluffy
head
dissapates
after
a
bit
but
leaves
a
ring
theres
a
slight
flowery
aroma
with
a
bit
of
malt
but
its
not
a
great
nose
it
tastes
very
flavorful
nice
malthops
balance
its
soft
in
the
mouth
and
goes
down
wonderfully
i
think
this
is
a
somewhat
better
beer
than
the
average
rating
indicates
pretty
spot
on
for
the
style
this
is
a
lot
like
a
drier
version
of
bitburger
i
could
see
buying
this
a
lot
it
was
distributed
here
in
california
overall
i
would
have
liked
a
couple
more
of
these
would
definitely
try
again
d
good
example
of
the
style
and
plenty
drinkable
but
there
are
many
others
that
are
better
and
two
are
with
15
miles
of
my
house
d
very
easy
to
drink
and
tastier
than
an
everyday
macro
could
make
a
great
session
brew
and
highly
recommended
for
a
gateway
beer
taste
mimics
the
aroma
light
and
crisp
and
refreshing
hop
bitterness
is
nice
great
balance
although
the
mouthfeel
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
kind
of
thin
dry
in
the
finish
drinkability
is
up
there
this
is
a
nice
light
beer
that
can
go
well
with
just
about
any
occasion
i
will
definitely
get
more
next
summer
i
am
really
surprised
at
how
much
i
enjoyed
this
one
i
am
normally
not
big
into
pilsners
but
cant
deny
this
one
a
nice
one
from
left
hand
indeed
extremely
drinkable
more
than
a
lawnmower
beer
still
this
beer
is
the
kind
that
could
convert
your
bubba
friends
to
throw
away
the
massproduced
yellow
fizzy
water
this
just
doesnt
do
it
for
me
it
needs
a
little
more
malt
balance
and
the
grassy
hop
bite
by
itsellf
just
isnt
enough
drinkability
a
very
easy
to
drink
german
pilsner
probably
not
a
benchmark
for
the
style
but
who
cares
this
is
just
a
good
beer
i
would
gladly
purchase
a
6
pack
a
classic
pilsner
taste
with
a
slightly
bitter
taste
with
a
little
malt
in
the
aftertaste
with
all
the
emphasis
on
hoppy
ales
i
e
ipas
by
american
brewers
it
is
nice
to
see
a
traditional
well
made
lager
especially
a
pilsner
i
would
choose
this
over
most
of
the
imported
pilsners
it
is
doubtful
one
could
buy
an
import
that
was
bottled
less
than
a
month
before
this
beer
poured
a
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
thick
head
the
aroma
is
initially
of
hops
followed
by
slightly
floral
or
citrus
notes
the
taste
is
hoppy
and
bitter
with
a
dry
semisweet
aftertaste
the
bitterness
is
noticed
throughout
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
lighter
side
overall
this
is
an
easy
drinking
pilsner
this
might
make
a
good
introductory
beer
to
someone
wishing
to
learn
more
about
tasting
imo
hopping
is
a
bit
too
aggressive
as
a
bavarian
pils
this
is
more
in
line
with
a
bohemian
pils
i
scored
this
as
a
bohemian
not
a
bad
beer
in
spite
of
slightly
lower
than
average
rating
dont
ask
me
to
explain
nice
light
gold
color
slight
head
smidgen
of
lace
well
maybe
over
carbonated
good
body
and
some
sweetness
to
compensate
the
bitterness
but
the
bitterness
does
contribute
for
a
very
long
finish
found
a
very
slight
hint
of
elemental
sulfur
in
the
nose
fleeting
but
there
nevertheless
drinkable
not
remarkable
but
worthwhile
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
nice
soapy
white
head
the
aroma
is
pretty
nonexistant
some
grassy
hop
and
grain
the
taste
has
a
dry
hoppiness
to
it
grainy
a
slight
cooked
veggie
taste
the
feel
is
light
and
watery
a
bit
astringent
an
average
pils
it
has
the
base
pilsner
taste
but
doesnt
go
the
distance
worth
a
try
and
a
good
summer
brew
watery
pils
flavor
quite
sweet
with
a
little
lemon
zest
earthy
hopping
mouthfeel
is
about
right
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
not
a
bad
pilsener
relatively
true
to
style
and
tasty
recommended
its
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
seems
a
bit
unbalanced
kind
of
chalky
and
acidic
not
that
drinkable
just
do
the
misaligned
flavor
profile
not
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
lh
after
finishing
the
glass
i
might
have
had
another
but
i
mixed
my
own
six
pack
and
i
only
got
one
of
these
very
crisp
with
a
fairly
strong
bitterness
not
so
clean
however
could
stand
to
be
a
little
bit
drier
with
a
tad
less
of
a
doughy
biscuity
malt
flavor
oh
and
the
dms
of
course
get
that
boil
rolling
guys
other
than
that
its
a
decent
lager
but
nothing
i
would
rush
out
to
buy
again
a
good
pils
is
hard
to
come
by
but
when
a
good
one
does
come
along
rest
assured
ill
snatch
it
up
as
for
this
one
its
more
of
a
try
it
once
and
pass
beer
d
pretty
good
beer
but
not
fabulous
it
is
nice
to
fine
a
pils
with
a
little
bit
of
hops
in
it
got
this
brew
in
a
mixed
12
pack
the
brew
poured
to
a
golden
color
with
a
nice
sized
white
head
which
left
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
at
the
top
of
the
glass
and
had
retention
through
out
over
all
a
nice
looking
brew
the
aromas
while
not
overly
exciting
where
inviting
had
a
clean
crisp
scent
of
light
sweat
pilsner
type
malt
with
a
spice
from
the
hops
saaz
as
i
said
it
is
an
inviting
brew
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
pretty
solid
the
taste
seems
to
be
on
par
with
the
aroma
nothing
extraordinary
about
it
but
an
easy
drinking
brew
one
that
i
could
spend
an
afternoon
or
evening
drinking
taste
seems
to
be
similar
to
the
aroma
which
a
sweet
feel
up
front
which
quickly
breaks
away
to
a
spicy
and
grassy
hop
taste
that
lingers
while
on
the
back
of
the
mouth
the
taste
seems
to
slightly
bring
more
to
the
game
that
the
aroma
over
all
i
think
that
this
is
a
solid
brew
very
enjoyable
easy
drinking
pils
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
almost
no
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
just
a
ring
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malt
with
very
mild
floral
hops
the
taste
was
of
very
pale
malt
balanced
by
a
light
hop
bitterness
a
little
on
the
bland
side
the
beer
is
very
light
on
the
palate
and
the
carbonation
is
a
little
on
the
heavy
side
i
must
say
i
really
did
not
enjoy
this
beer
im
not
that
big
a
fan
of
pilsners
and
this
reminds
me
why
cheers
pale

flavors
a

hop
flavor

a

sufficiently
balanced
but
a
little
blah
clean
and
well
made
but
nothing
to
shout
about
light
bodied
and
quaffable
nothing
special
probably
pretty
tasty
on
a
hot
summer
day
if
really
cold
only
caveat
is
that
it
may
be
a
bit
old
based
on
the
bottling
date
very
drinkable
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
drinkability
soso
in
my
book
this
is
a
bit
weak
overall
and
there
are
many
better
german
style
pils
beers
on
the
market
i
really
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
from
this
beer
left
hand
can
be
all
over
the
map
in
terms
of
quality
and
german
pilseners
can
be
hard
to
get
exactly
right
im
impressed
though
while
it
doesnt
put
a
scare
into
the
best
of
this
style
polestar
pilsner
is
a
quality
beer
that
knows
where
its
headed
and
how
to
get
there
all
told
it
presents
as
a
decently
built
pils
but
the
body
is
hollow
and
frail
with
added
structure
and
support
this
could
be
standoutish
presently
it
sits
at
respectable
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
exciting
many
other
pils
to
be
had
instead
polestar
is
a
hazy
pale
golden
with
lots
of
carbonation
the
tall
head
is
slick
yet
foamy
aroma
features
plenty
of
saaz
hop
with
an
nice
underlying
sweetness
flavor
is
more
of
the
same
with
hop
being
supported
by
a
sweet
malt
as
this
warms
up
the
malt
flavors
become
more
pronounced
drinkability
is
high
overall
polestar
equals
a
good
pilsner
it
seems
to
me
that
the
american
microbreweries
are
getting
better
at
this
style
i
am
often
trying
more
of
these
that
i
like
this
beer
is
one
of
them
its
more
malty
in
aroma
flavor
and
texture
than
grainy
the
hops
add
a
spice
herbal
and
earthy
character
without
the
bitey
astringency
the
beer
is
creamy
and
hold
a
good
head
retention
until
the
end
finsihes
quite
clean
and
crisp
with
a
mild
minty
green
apple
snap
good
summertime
beer
d
not
my
cup
of
tea
there
are
much
better
pilseners
out
there
although
this
one
is
a
fairly
inoffensive
example
of
the
style
glad
i
just
bought
the
single
the
beer
is
of
course
initially
quite
cold
it
adds
to
the
refreshing
character
which
is
welcome
on
this
100
day
but
it
drowns
out
the
flavor
a
bit
a
touch
of
toasted
malt
character
and
a
hint
of
grain
sweetness
round
out
what
is
otherwise
a
nice
hoppy
pilsner
lightly
spicy
with
a
smooth
herbal
hop
character
and
a
nice
sharp
bitterness
in
the
finish
as
the
beer
warms
up
a
bit
the
malt
character
becomes
a
bit
rounder
it
adds
a
bit
to
the
body
of
the
brew
and
helps
to
mix
with
and
balance
the
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
in
fact
it
is
perfect
for
a
hot
day
as
it
is
fairly
light
on
the
palate
it
could
perhaps
use
a
bit
more
malt
and
hop
character
but
like
i
said
it
is
nice
and
refreshing
as
is
overall
i
wouldnt
recommend
it
it
is
a
clean
refreshing
beer
but
there
is
not
much
redeeming
about
it
uf
12
oz
bottled
on
32206
it
pours
into
the
pilsner
glass
a
thin
pale
yellow
with
a
half
inch
white
head
that
leaves
some
lace
it
has
an
aroma
of
grains
hop
spice
and
light
skunk
with
a
taste
that
is
rather
clean
and
flavorless
there
are
notes
of
musty
hops
paletoasted
malts
and
a
mild
bitterness
that
hides
in
the
back
of
the
throat
leaving
a
short
finish
it
has
a
medium
body
and
feels
good
enough
but
overall
its
not
that
great
of
an
example
and
i
got
bored
of
it
rather
quickly
overall
impression
nice
solid
pilsener
drinkable
and
thirstquenching
great
for
the
summer
months
to
come
the
beer
as
it
sets
in
its
pilsner
glass
after
pouring
from
the
12ounce
brown
bottle
is
a
luminous
gold
with
a
modest
bright
white
head
which
is
creamy
in
texture
after
its
erosion
the
lace
forms
a
velum
like
curtain
upon
the
glass
nose
is
the
prototypical
pilsner
malt
sweet
and
clean
start
is
lightly
sweet
with
a
nice
grain
presence
the
top
light
in
its
feel
to
the
palate
finish
is
light
to
moderate
in
acidity
the
hops
pleasingly
mild
and
the
aftertaste
dry
and
long
lasting
personally
lagerspilsners
are
not
my
favorite
style
but
i
must
say
that
i
dont
think
theres
a
prettier
sight
than
a
pilsner
in
its
own
glass
covered
with
condensation
and
the
drops
running
down
the
glass
clearing
a
path
so
you
can
see
that
perfect
gold
body
with
its
bright
white
head
to
me
this
says
beer
this
will
make
a
great
beer
or
hot
summer
days
quality
lawnmower
kinda
beer
for
those
hot
summer
days
i
suspect
ill
revisit
it
then
couldnt
read
the
bottled
on
date
on
any
of
the
bottles
space
is
just
whited
out
weird
overall
i
felt
this
beer
has
quite
a
bit
of
similarity
to
the
corn
syrup
flavor
of
the
macro
beers
that
said
the
hoppines
does
help
to
make
this
beer
better
than
the
average
macro
drinkability
is
fine
exactly
what
you
would
expect
for
a
decent
pilsner
this
certainly
hasnt
won
me
over
not
recommended
this
is
a
pretty
simple
albeit
good
beer
the
cereal
grains
and
husk
dont
quite
mix
with
the
floral
hops
and
degree
of
bitterness
hampering
the
drinkability
and
not
quite
akin
to
a
quality
pils
checking
their
website
i
find
that
only
the
tabernash
pils
is
listed
somewhat
odd
from
its
list
of
ingredients

light

with

something
just
not
right
about
this
pils
this
is
a
fresh
sample
brewed
on
061505
wonderful
color
for
a
pilsner
a
much
more
full
taste
than
what
were
used
to
seeing
at
the
gas
station
o
there
is
a
harshness
to
the
alcohol
of
this
beer
which
is
surprising
since
it
clocks
in
at
only
5
5
but
i
guess
i
cannot
be
too
surprised
considering
the
price
67
for
a
single
can
not
offensive
but
not
a
beer
that
i
would
seek
out
again
i
could
see
serving
this
at
a
tailgate
where
the
majority
of
folks
were
not
into
craft
beers
as
something
different
but
still
enjoyable
maybe
a
slight
gateway
beer
to
trying
something
different
overall
there
is
taste
there
doesnt
feel
watered
down
and
is
of
extremely
good
value
great
budget
buy
o
i
cant
hate
on
it
for
4
a
six
pack
just
like
its
identical
cousin
its
a
great
choice
for
cheap
drunkery
its
just
a
bit
crisperdrier
than
its
aforementioned
cousin
and
would
make
a
decent
hot
weather
beer
personally
though
id
rather
drink
something
else
this
would
make
an
awesome
lawnmower
beer
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
the
price
is
attractive
it
gives
me
hope
for
the
other
varieties
that
are
available
i
tried
this
out
because
i
like
trader
joes
other
products
and
i
think
they
only
carry
quality
stuff
but
their
beer
only
can
be
described
as
passable
it
has
an
average
taste
but
nothing
distinctive
about
it
its
also
not
as
clean
and
crisp
as
a
pilsner
should
be
oi
was
surprised
that
in
the
end
this
beer
was
too
weak
for
my
blood
mixed
six
from
trader
joes
in
tally
drank
in
the
hotel
room
while
up
there
visiting
fsu
for
hadley

times

a
brand
sold
at
trader
joes
for
3
49
a
6pack
an
ale
a
lager
and
a
pilsner
are
all
offered
reviewed
here
is
the
pilsner
the
pilsner
pours
a
pale
golden
color
darker
than
straw
about
the
same
as
a
budweiser
with
a
nice
soapy
head
and
some
satisfying
lacing
on
the
glass
a
very
pleasing
aroma
sweet
malts
grassiness
and
a
slightly
metallic
scent
the
taste
is
very
appealing
a
soft
graininess
cereal
sweet
grass
some
herbal
and
mineral
tastes
show
up
in
the
finish
i
feel
like
this
may
come
from
the
varieties
of
hops
used
and
they
fit
nicely
in
the
profile
a
sip
sits
nicely
in
the
mouth
with
a
mediumthin
body
and
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
that
doesnt
overdo
it
this
is
not
a
complex
brew
by
any
means
but
its
more
pleasant
and
drinkable
than
you
would
expect
a
drawback
is
the
sweetness
that
become
somewhat
cloying
after
several
beers
but
its
become
my
everyday
session
beer
based
on
its
price
availability
and
drinkability
the
verdict
not
bad
another
of
the
trader
joes
bargain
brands
its
much
better
than
their
name
tag
but
i
prefer
the
tasty
simpler
times
lager
if
youre
looking
for
a
cheap
six
pack
of
beer
its
hard
to
beat
much
better
than
any
of
the
macro
brews
on
the
market
o
better
than
most
macrobrews
for
literally
half
the
price
ill
take
it
rjt
overall
i
would
recommend
this
brew
to
anyone
who
appreciates
a
flavorful
nonmacro
beer
that
isnt
too
full
of
itself
also
its
vegan
which
is
interesting
overall
however
this
beer
is
just
dull
and
earthy
in
an
unsatisfying
way
it
is
not
as
offensive
as
the
descriptors
i
used
above
would
indicate
but
id
never
call
this
a
good
beer
i
wish
the
big
breweries
tasted
like
this
one
great
beer
thank
you
trader
joe
the
two
buck
chuck
of
beer
poured
this
german
pilsener
from
a
12
oz
can
into
a
pint
glass
this
pils
poured
a
clear
golden
color
the
aroma
consisted
of
husked
malt
and
lemongrass
light
in
body
this
pilsner
had
a
foundation
of
malted
grain
a
husky
bite
that
brings
a
nice
level
of
complexity
to
a
traditional
style
here
is
just
a
touch
of
citric
bittering
hops
that
round
out
the
swallow
finish
is
dry
overall
a
nice
brew
and
an
excellent
buy
at

a
can
at
trader
joes
if
your
going
to
serve
a
pilsner
on
a
hot
summer
day
check
this
one
out
your
pallet
and
your
wallet
will
be
glad
you
did
nothing
too
special
about
this
pilsner
besides
the
price
3
49
for
a
6pack
i
can
see
this
beer
being
consumed
in
about
any
whore

you
pretentious
jerks
need
to
get
past
the
price
of
this
beer
and
realize
that
just
because
you
not
getting
ripped
off
doesnt
mean
it
cant
be
good
id
bet
the
farm
that
if
i
put
this
beer
in
front
of
you
in
some
foolish
glass
and
told
you
it
was
from
a
brewery
in
germany
and
cost
4
a
bottle
you
simple
minded
fool
would
be
creaming
all
over
it
this
is
a
solid
brew
for
an
unbelievable
price
o
not
a
bad
pilsner
just
nothing
special
not
a
bad
go
to
beer
for
about
4
bucks
a
6
pack
throw
it
in
the
cooler
for
a
hot
summer
fishing
trip
day
or
mowing
the
lawn
further
proof
that
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
buy
a
big
macro
beer
this
is
a
simple
decent
quality
american
lager
nothing
special
but
nothing
offensive
light

with
a
tinge
of
bitterness

i
dont
understand
all
the
snob
reviews
for
this
beer
yes
it
is
cheap
yes
it
comes
in
a
can
and
yes
it
is
brewed
with
adjuncts
but
so
what
this
is
a
very
good
beer
and
does
not
do
all
the
nasty
things
to
your
system
that
many
more
expensive
us
macros
are
wont
to
do
one
of
my
favorite
go
to
session
beers
and
it
will
not
leave
you
with
a
bad
hangover
heartily
recommended
this
poured
a
clear
golden
straw
with
light
foam
that
rapidly
dissipates
theres
an
aroma
of
cereal
malts
corn
followed
by
no
hops
to
speak
of
the
flavor
is
musty
on
the
sweet
side
with
some
light
bittering
but
not
much
other
than
carbonation
to
speak
of
it
has
all
that
musty
corn
adjunct
lager
flavor
with
not
as
much
of
the
nasty
aftertaste
as
a
bud
as
well
as
and
a
little
more
malt
body
still
pass
at
least
its
cheap
overall
very
hard
to
finish
pretty
poor
id
take
a
coors
light
over
it
therere
just
too
many
off
flavors
to
even
remotely
enjoy
it
it
tastes
very
corn
forward
but
theres
no
crackery
backend
to
provide
back
to
the
sweetness
d
tastes
rich
and
maltygrainy
with
a
buttery
toast
character
and
only
a
slight
hops
presence
nice
body
and
quite
drinkable
though
not
one
id
pursue
again
even
at
the
trader
joes
budget
3

price
thank
you
trader
joe
2nd
time
trying
tjs
simpler
times
first
time
i
thought
i
was
crazy
simpler
times
indeed
this
beer
tastes
like
what
i
thought
beer
would
taste
like
when
my
dad
and
friends
were
knocking
them
back
way
back
when
this
is
what
budweisenheimer
etc
should
taste
like
its
so
fresh
and
so
clean
but
with
a
malty
little
snap
and
the
hops
are
there
just
popping
up
a
bit
to
tell
you
hi
its
more
complex
than
the
label
lets
on
each
little
sip
hits
a
little
different
and
your
taste
buds
dont
get
worn
out
like
with
a
raging
ipa
or
some
such
stuff
which
is
good
but
cmon
it
is
summer
in
tx
at
the
moment
its
just
good
easy
drinkin
beer
but
inneresting
enuff
to
keep
you
looking
forward
to
the
next
sip
and
the
price
is
crazy
really
this
is
better
than
many
other
beers
for
its
style
and
ive
had
similar
in
the
upper
price
rangers
and
i
wish
the
big
macros
tasted
like
this
this
stuff
is
good
beer
thank
you
trader
joe
ill
drive
to
ft
worth
to
stock
up
no
problem
good
stuff
overall
this
american
take
on
a
german
pilsener
matches
every
characteristic
of
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
only
67
a
can
or
3
99
a
six
pack
this
is
a
bang
for
you
buck
kind
of
beer
surprisingly
good
for
3
a
6pack
overall
not
sure
that
id
call
this
a
pilsener
would
compare
favorably
to
many
macrobrews
but
lacks
any
real
interesting
characteristics
if
youre
considering
buying
it
then
stop
considering
just
do
it
4
for
a
6pack
is
a
much
better
price
than
youll
find
on
pretty
much
anything
else
and
its
actually
fairly
good
feels
medium
to
light
in
body
dry
to
the
palate
and
yet
thirst
quenching
id
say
this
is
not
of
the
german
style
too
maybe
a
strong
czech
i
dont
know
what
the
preprohibition
pils
tastes
like
so
i
cannot
say
this
is
what
it
is
for
3
99
im
not
sure
as
why
some
people
are
bashing
it
what
did
you
really
expect
for
3
99
i
mean
really
its
3
99
for
6
beers
find
that
in
any
bar
or
pub
anyway
its
an
easy
drinker
that
actually
has
some
flavor
compared
to
most
cheapsters
in
a
can
im
not
goanna
fluff
up
the
review
with
a
bunch
of
adjectives
either
find
a
trader
joes
and
pick
up
a
6er
if
you
dont
like
it
hand
it
out
as
a
courtesy
beer
for
those
that
show
up
and
never
bring
anything
overall
pretty
bad
but
not
horrible
not
coors
light
or
bud
level
of
terribleness
its
more
of
a
macro
extract
like
beer
but
a
bit
higher
level
than
the
crappy
crap
thats
usually
out
there
overall
as
i
said
its
not
a
great
beer
but
it
is
palatable
and
moderately
drinkable
for
a
beer
in
this
price
range
like
2
50
for
a
sixpack
its
pretty
damn
good
actually
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
that
tends
to
vanish
quickly
leaves
some
lacing
as
the
head
disappears
light
malty
and
mild
belgian
yeast
aromas
decent
mouthfeel
and
good
carbonation
a
pilsner
that
behaves
like
a
lager
but
well
worth
the
few
bucks
i
paid
for
a
sixer
of
cans
not
a
bad
cheap
pils
at
all
yeah
a
bit
adjuncty
but
surprising
hop
balance
helps
a
lot
crazy
drinkable
im
thirsty
and
this
is
hitting
the
spot
considering
the
price
this
is
pretty
good
and
my
score
reflects
its
price
to
performance
ratio
noticeably
better
than
other
beers
in
its
price
range
but
certainly
doesnt
stack
up
to
better
and
more
expensive
pilsners
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
1
inch
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
random
dots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
grain
light
fruits
and
alcohol
there
is
an
almost
artificial
margarita
smell
to
this
one
taste
is
of
grains
corn
flakes
alcohol
and
some
light
fruity
flavors
there
is
a
mild
bitterness
in
the
back
of
the
throat
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
higher
level
of
carbonation
with
a
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
average
beer
but
decent
for
the
price
0
50
a
can
i
could
see
myself
stocking
these
for
a
party
with
noncraft
beer
drinkers
o
an
average
beer
overall
meh
this
is
better
than
the
regular
lager
but
it
is
another
beer
i
dont
care
to
drink
again
drinkability
i
would
drink
it
again
very
drinkable
and
easy
to
drink
not
spectacular
but
still
pretty
good
not
bad
either
it
is
also
cheaper
than
bud
and
tastes
better
unremarkable
but
not
bad
by
any
means
o
i
paid
2
49
for
a
6
pack
and
i
can
say
i
got
what
i
expected
this
stuff
is
incredibly
cheap
tasting
but
for
the
price
its
a
solid
option
id
rather
drink
this
than
majority
of
the
big
beer
swill
you
see
everywhere
else
glad
to
try
it
not
sure
i
could
drink
more
than
3
or
4
of
these
at
a
time
so
i
cant
see
it
being
a
lawnmower
beer
but
for
one
or
two
after
work
this
is
a
great
beer
probably
will
make
a
few
more
trips
to
trader
joes
to
pick
this
one
up
again
this
is
a
very
unpleasant
beer
to
drink
never
again
i
dont
know
is
it
supposed
to
have
this
extreme
sweetness
all
in
all
not
bad
but
not
great
by
any
stretch
for
the
price
though
wow
cant
really
complain
that
much
it
doesnt
seem
like
a
true
german
pilsner
but
a
six
pack
is
cheaper
than
most
singles
so
im
decently
happy
and
will
drink
again
average
beer
not
really
a
pilsner
but
ok
overall
not
a
bad
little
beer
and
this
price
is
right
this
might
be
a
cheap
summer
sixer
that
i
take
hiking
and
camping
o
there
are
a
lot
of
pictures
of
the
band
during
the
big
pink
era
sitting
back
laughing
playing
creating
while
drinking
piels
real
draft
simpler
times
reminds
me
of
what
i
think
that
beer
would
have
been
maybe
it
just
has
to
do
with
the
name
and
how
i
want
to
associate
this
beer
with
those
pictures
a
simpler
time
of
just
being
at
the
top
of
your
game
and
creating
something
timeless
is
this
beer
timeless
no
but
its
the
times
you
have
and
the
people
youre
with
while
drinking
this
that
matter
back
yard
bbqs
acoustic
guitar
songs
the
sun
setting
a
baseball
game
on
somewhere
in
the
background
at
least
id
like
to
think
so
o
pretty
good
for
the
price
nice
relaxing
beer
ive
probably
have
bought
it
4
or
5
times
now
so
i
enjoy
it
and
would
recommend
it
all
in
all
not
bad
and
a
great
deal
for
the
price
point
at
50
cents
a
can
surely
ive
drank
far
worse
in
some
perverse
way
its
so
jarring
to
have
actual
hop
bitterness
in
a
cheap
beer
and
it
may
have
hurt
my
review
rather
than
comparing
this
to
its
true
pricepoint
competition
natural
ice
icehouse
high
life
i
find
myself
yearning
for
a
prima
pils
and
perhaps
thats
not
fair
ill
put
it
this
way
the
beer
was
worth
the
2
99
that
i
spent
on
the
six
pack
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
from
there
overall
this
is
a
decent
brew
which
is
somewhat
appealing
at
the
price
point
and
the
fact
that
its
canned
not
necessarily
a
standalone
brew
id
drink
but
definitely
would
be
appealing
for
a
summer
bbq
available
in
cans
at
trader
joes
o
simpler
times
pils
was
an
unexpected
and
enjoyable
surprise
is
it
a
classical
german
pils
nope
though
it
certainly
is
an
easy
drinking
summertime
lawnmower
beer
all
things
considered
this
a
budget
friendly
session
lager
you
dont
have
to
feel
ashamed
to
keep
in
the
fridge
thumbs
up
minhas
brewery
simpler
times
pilsner
is
cheap
read
inexpensive
beer
that
tastes
cheap
read
not
good
its
a
sad
and
pathetic
state
of
affairs
that
i
would
still
prefer
this
stuff
to
the
most
popular
lagers
in
america
circa
2011
simply
put
this
is
a
cheap
american
pilsener
made
primarily
for
ease
in
drinking
on
a
warm
summer
day
flavor
wise
it
has
no
extraordinary
qualities
but
no
real
flaws
either
mild
soft
malt
flavors
with
a
simple
and
somewhat
thin
body
refreshing
in
that
it
lacks
the
metallic
flavors
a
lot
of
other
heavily
adjuncted
beers
have
im
convinced
this
is
the
same
beer
as
their
lager
only
lacking
in
said
adjuncts
this
beer
might
be
one
of
the
best
values
on
the
market
i
cant
believe
i
waited
so
long
to
finally
try
this
its
a
solid
pils
at
an
unbeatable
price
from
a
12
oz
can
pours
a
lightlyhazed
solid
gold
with
low
carbonation
and
two
fingers
of
frothy
head
that
retains
well
and
tries
to
lace
the
glass
floral
and
spicy
hops
in
the
nose
with
corn
and
light
malt
tastes
almost
metallic
grainy
with
sweet
corn
pineycitric
hops
that
contribute
a
moderate
bitterness
and
a
distinct
nearly
overbearing
apple
ester
from
the
yeast
the
body
is
crisp
dry
and
light
not
as
sweet
and
a
bit
more
hoppy
than
the
other
minhas
lagers
ive
had
which
is
nice
if
you
are
at
trader
joes
and
trying
to
choose
between
simpler
times
lager
and
pilsner
go
for
this
one
pretty
much
my
goto
cheap
beer
if
im
too
brokecheap
to
afford
gansett
or
pbr
which
isnt
too
often
the
tatse
is
not
complex
but
it
is
tasty
there
is
a
nice
breadyness
to
it
and
the
alcohol
hits
nicely
on
the
tounge
of
course
the
name
does
it
justice
simpler
times
and
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
a
great
simple
beer
one
that
i
could
easily
make
a
night
out
of
d
overall
good
beer
with
a
really
cheap
price
tag
got
mine
at
a
trader
joes
for
3
99
kinda
hard
to
argue
with
that
when
macrocanned
piss
is
more
expensive
d
this
is
a
damn
good
beer
that
happens
to
sell
for
under
1
a
can
oh
for
simpler
times
im
drinking
my
first
can
but
i
can
see
this
becoming
a
good
standby
beer
when
my
own
ale
keg
runs
dry
drinkability
is
ok
i
like
it
better
than
most
budget
type
beers
in
its
category
overall
you
get
what
you
pay
for
sometimes
no
more
on
this
one
50
cents
cant
go
too
wrong
there
even
if
in
a
creepy
can
it
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
short
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
wheat
grass
flowers
greens
and
a
hint
of
pepper
the
taste
is
very
similar
with
the
addition
of
light
orange
peel
and
even
lighter
banana
the
body
is
rather
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
feel
overall
a
kinda
surprisingly
nice
pils
not
the
best
out
there
but
plenty
of
enjoyment
for
the
price
d
this
beer
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
and
by
too
much
i
mean
off
putting
bitterness
to
this
beer
i
didnt
really
like
the
taste
or
the
aftertaste
dont
really
like
this
one
too
much
but
it
does
taste
about
average
and
on
par
with
more
adjunct
lagers
d
not
bad
ryan
gave
me
this
as
a
joke
beer
but
its
not
that
funny
while
this
beer
may
not
be
for
every
ba
type
it
does
have
a
strong
point
its
cheap
at
2
99
a
sixpack
given
that
and
the
fact
it
doesnt
taste
bad
youd
think
beer
pongers
and
broke
college
kids
would
be
filling
their
refrigerators
with
this
stuff
pretty
good
beer
great
price
and
a
bit
less
harsh
and
a
little
lower
abv
than
its
lager
sister
beer
i
drink
it
castle
temperature
stored
in
my
nonheated
cementslab
garage
and
find
it
preferable
that
way
to
refrigerated
the
famed
trader
joes
detectives
must
have
made
some
kind
of
offer
to
this
brewer
to
exchange
volume
they
could
never
have
dreamed
of
for
a
bargain
price
but
ill
raise
a
can
to
capitalism
since
its
to
the
beer
aficinados
benefit
spend
what
you
save
on
the
beer
on
some
of
tjs
awesome
nuts
solid
all
around
everything
you
want
in
a
retro
lagerdrinkability
clean
palate
and
just
enough
flavor
to
be
different
from
the
mainstream
a
fun
nobrainer
beer
that
is
perfect
for
a
few
rounds
of
slop
cricket
overall
a
beer
to
drink
when
it
is
hot
and
with
friends
no
frills
and
for
3
99
a
six
pack
at
trader
joes
did
i
mention
its
inexpensive
2
99
for
a
six
pack
of
cans
at
trader
joes
in
california
if
you
have
to
have
this
kind
of
beer
and
it
has
to
be
in
a
can
you
can
pay
more
and
get
worse
with
little
effort
i
cant
say
a
lot
for
this
beer
because
it
really
isnt
very
complex
just
disappointing
hard
to
call
it
a
german
pilsner
more
like
an
american
adjunct
gone
bad
or
poorly
brewed
d
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
should
be
consumed
as
cold
and
as
quickly
as
possible
i
honestly
cannot
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
taste
is
gently
sweet
with
some
malty
grain
carried
by
the
somewhat
creamy
mouthfeel
an
ok
pils
even
better
price
drinkability
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
extremely
refreshing
its
far
from
the
best
beer
out
there
even
of
its
style
but
its
low
price
tag
cost
me
4
64
for
a
canned
six
pack
after
tax
in
nyc
makes
this
one
a
huge
bargain
it
isnt
complex
but
has
enough
flavor
to
be
decent
a
good
session
beer
or
good
to
have
around
as
just
a
refresher
if
the
price
were
higher
this
would
be
so
much
less
worthy
d
above
d
on
a
hot
day
i
can
imagine
going
through
these
quickly
d
for
ultracheap
beer
this
is
pretty
dang
good
it
doesnt
taste
like
a
pilsener
and
there
is
a
maltliquor
roughness
to
it
but
hey
what
do
ya
expect
for
a
coupla
bucks
thanks
for
mnwags
for
this
one
light
bodied
fizzy
its
a
typical
adjuct
lager
build
and
features
similar
drinkability
to
other
lowrung
examples
of
the
style
if
considered
a
true
pils
the
scores
would
drop
substancially
heavier
in
body
than
macros
and
tastier
too
it
retains
the
fizz
and
refreshing
bits
and
turns
its
back
on
the
bud
light
version
of
drinkability
a
cheap
pilsner
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
alright
too
nothing
spectacular
and
has
a
bit
of
corn
taste
it
seems
but
quite
decent
for
what
it
is
very
clear
clean
golden
straw
body
foamy
finger
of
cottony
white
head
does
not
stick
around
that
long
nose
of
honeyish
malts
a
little
corn
or
rice
and
some
spicy
slightly
herbal
hops
soft
slightly
sweet
toasted
malt
up
front
a
little
honey
and
a
little
cerealy
graininess
mild
hop
flavor
and
bitterness
a
little
peppery
with
an
herbal
twang
clean
finish
with
lingering
honey
cereal
moderate
body
with
not
overly
fizzy
feel
crisp
and
refreshing
for
a
hot
summer
day
not
bad
especially
for
the
price
pours
a
straw
yellow
color
with
a
huge
foamy
white
head
smells
grainy
sweet
and
a
little
like
corn
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
in
the
taste
department
either
just
carbonation
and
adjuncts
thought
for
the
price
2
99
at
trader
joes
and
considering
the
lager
was
pretty
decent
that
this
might
be
a
good
buy
i
was
wrong
hey
what
the
heck
is
going
on
my
trader
joes
is
3
99
a
6er
d
not
fabulous
but
not
bad
certainly
would
buy
it
throughout
the
summer
when
ill
have
no
income
this
beer
is
what
is
says
simpler
times
i
will
actually
keep
some
on
hand
for
myself
for
evenings
on
the
patio
with
a
fire
going
in
the
pit
is
it
a
bells
or
a
great
lakes
no
but
it
has
its
place
this
is
a
drinkableenough
beer
i
had
some
while
grilling
and
also
used
it
in
onionring
batter
which
was
acceptable
d
probably
the
best
thing
about
this
beer
is
how
sessionable
it
is
though
i
would
definitely
grab
something
else
if
given
the
choice
but
hey
at
around
50c
per
can
i
cant
really
complain
pilsners
are
supposed
to
have
a
hop
presence
and
this
one
does
but
its
still
too
sweet
to
allow
me
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
still
at
67
a
can
i
cant
complain
drinkability
id
rather
have
one
over
a
bmc
but
not
by
a
wide
margin
overall
a
tough
one
to
drink
oh
and
not
a
pils
it
is
not
bad
looking
it
has
a
very
clear
finish
to
its
yellow
body
it
has
an
average
head
with
loose
lace
this
beer
is
sort
of
cheap
tasting
it
reminds
me
of
malt
liquor
it
has
a
fruity
adjunct
after
taste
it
has
a
some
what
fruity
and
bitter
flavor
it
is
very
thin
with
some
bite
nothing
mind
blowing
here
but
this
beer
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
there
is
a
decent
crispness
hops
are
present
just
not
as
present
as
i
would
like
the
fact
is
that
at
3
996
pack
its
hard
to
find
beer
this
drinkable
theres
nothing
offensive
here
just
a
totally
decent
pilsner
recommended
drinkability
i
wouldnt
necessarily
go
for
this
but
in
a
brandy
glass
it
tasted
much
better
than
i
thought
i
would
drink
this
if
nothing
else
was
available
my
pour
created
a
foamy
soapy
bonewhite
head
that
was
bursting
with
co2
bubbles
trying
to
settle
down
like
a
group
of
rowdy
freshmen
when
the
principal
enters
the
room
unannounced
it
had
about
the
same
success
finally
becoming
a
thick
twofingered
cap
the
color
was
a
deep
goldenyellow
with
only
the
slightest
haze
but
still
very
clear
enabling
me
to
read
signage
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
nose
was
slightly
sweet
definitely
a
germanstyle
pilsner
and
certainly
a
lager
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
pleasant
honeylager
taste
on
the
tongue
not
bad
but
more
lagerlike
than
pilsnerlike
finish
was
again
on
the
sweet
side
not
to
my
taste
oh
well
ill
keep
trying
tastes
like
something
ab
would
come
up
with
to
compete
with
good
beer
d
this
would
actually
probably
be
pretty
good
ice
cold
on
a
hot
day
even
in
the
winter
time
i
dont
think
i
would
have
a
problem
knocking
back
a
few
of
these
if
i
didnt
have
anything
else
in
the
fridge
md
this
is
a
pretty
average
pilsner
it
goes
down
very
easy
and
even
could
be
called
refreshing
quite
different
than
the
lager
this
beer
is
best
poured
quite
slowly
to
minimize
the
resilient
foam
and
let
the
hops
participate
this
may
only
be
2
99
but
it
is
not
worth
drinking
i
had
to
try
it
out
of
curiousity
but
i
am
surprised
trader
joe
stocks
such
a
lame
beverage
terrible
beer
drinkability
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
the
quality
seems
way
too
long
for
even
an
attempt
at
a
pils
most
of
the
beers
at
tjs
i
can
do
but
this
ones
something
that
i
wouldnt
try
again
unless
it
was
hot
out
the
beer
was
ice
cold
and
there
was
nothing
else
but
i
may
opt
to
snag
another
6pack
of
something
else
at
a
local
minimart
especially
if
there
was
one
nearby
taste
less
taste
then
smell
it
starts
out
with
a
sweet
taste
leading
into
a
very
tiny
hop
flavor
at
the
end
this
taste
is
not
at
all
what
i
would
expect
with
a
pilsner
considering
there
is
very
little
hop
flavor
at
all
tmdexpected
more
based
on
the
smell
semisweet
and
a
little
bitterness
on
the
back
end
a
crisp
fizzy
mouthfeel
and
an
easy
drink
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
did
my
best
to
rate
it
for
what
it
is
drinkability
not
recommended
again
ill
say
its
suspiciously
similar
to
the
simpler
times
lager
even
for
a
simple
pilsner
its
a
below
average
underperfomer
will
buy
again
probably
a
case
for
the
next
time
i
bbq
not
sure
why
everyones
beefing
on
this
beermaybe
its
that
its
miscast
as
a
macro
lager
id
put
it
more
in
the
range
of
a
czech
pilsnertasted
like
pilsner
urquell
to
me
except
fresher
and
thus
better
kind
of
a
hobos
duvel
without
any
of
the
manic
yeast
or
deceptive
bulk
on
its
grain
anyway
at
4
or
5
bucks
a
sixer
im
not
complaining
went
great
with
buffalo
wings
and
hockey
on
the
tube
overall
a
good
lager
with
nice
phenols
which
was
suprising
crisp
and
clean
flavor
good
for
a
hot
spring
or
summer
day
underrated
on
ba
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
almost
no
head
whatsoever
smells
only
of
sweet
adjuncts
mostly
corn
not
much
malt
presence
in
the
nose
first
sip
is
bland
cereal
and
just
a
tad
of
hop
bitterness
not
much
positive
aspects
in
this
one
simpler
times
needs
more
complexity
pours
clear
yellow
with
a
solid
white
head
soft
sweet
aroma
lightly
floral
and
bready
tastes
like
a
fairly
average
american
lager
grainy
and
sweet
light
and
crisp
obviously
not
very
inspiring
stuff
sort
of
reminds
me
of
the
simpler
times
though
and
how
i
dont
drink
beer
like
this
anymore
d
pretty
high
drinkability
i
dont
really
like
the
metallic
taste
from
what
i
remember
i
actually
prefer
the
simpler
times
lager
note
42011
review
submitted
when
still
classified
as
an
adjunct
lager
as
a
german
pils
the
score
should
be
lower
for
now
the
overall
score
is
being
changed
from
4
0
to
3
0
d
not
terrible
and
certainly
better
than
the
simpler
times
lager
but
even
at
trader
joes
there
are
better
choices
i
gues
for
4
99
i
shouldnt
expect
any
better
i
was
just
hoping
that
tjs
quality
standards
might
help
to
no
avail
i
will
try
to
pawn
the
rest
off
on
the
neighbors
quite
dissapointing
decent
head
with
little
or
no
lacing
appeasing
clean
golden
color
smells
of
bread
and
some
other
unusual
corn
the
smell
should
warn
you
of
the
taste
semisweet
initial
flavor
that
leaves
a
bitter
aftertaste
light
mouthfeel
and
a
generally
flat
under
carbonated
feel
would
not
recommend
based
on
that
unusual
smell
and
bitter
aftertaste
hard
to
drink
more
than
one
cheap
and
better
of
the
two
simpler
times
pours
a
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
soon
fades
to
a
fine
film
and
holds
the
aroma
is
unremarkablesome
faint
corn
and
breads
the
taste
is
much
better
than
the
aroma
would
suggest
with
a
bit
of
fruit
and
some
good
yeasty
biscuit
emerging
and
lingering
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
and
the
finish
is
short
and
clean
in
conclusion
not
a
bad
little
pils
at
all
pleasant
muted
malty
flavor
rather
thin
body
but
equally
low
carbonation
light
hopnot
really
present
in
the
shortlived
aftertaste
the
taste
is
similar
mostly
a
decent
pale
lager
with
fruity
grain
plus
noticeable
hops
mostly
grassy
it
starts
somewhat
sweet
before
a
more
bitter
finish
but
its
all
a
little
off
it
has
an
odd
light
faintly
acrid
cooked
vegetableoldgrassburnt
butter
quality
that
i
have
encountered
in
subpar
lagers
sometimes
and
this
taste
and
the
bitterness
are
a
bit
rough
and
faintly
unpleasant
however
these
qualities
do
not
detract
too
much
and
overall
its
still
basically
drinkable
its
not
terrible
but
it
almost
is
not
completely
sure
this
is
superior
to
the
bmc
style
beers
or
not
tastes
like
it
was
fermented
hot
or
with
sugar
to
boost
alcohol
levels
pretty
sure
i
wont
be
buying
this
again
this
is
barely
average
but
you
could
do
much
worse
especially
for
the
price
nice
in
a
pinch
like
the
week
before
payday
dability
flavor
a
bit
disappointing
the
simpler
times
lager
was
cheaper
and
a
bit
better
in
my
view
not
a
clean
refreshing
lager
single
from
trader
joes
reston
the
flavor
almost
comes
across
as
syrupy
in
its
grainy
and
grassy
character
maybe
that
was
the
texture
but
i
just
seemed
juicy
id
drink
it
again
on
a
hot
day
easy
to
drink
has
that
hoppy
taste
but
not
overwhelming
must
try
hard
to
find
but
this
is
an
amazing
excellent
beer
i
got
it
in
a
restaurant
havent
tried
it
in
a
bottle
yet
i
like
crystal
clear
pilsners
this
one
was
oddly
cloudy
taste
fairly
generic
not
bad
a
nice
clear
no
haze
straw
color
clean
crisp
taste
with
hints
of
sweetness
good
dry
finish
that
rolls
off
the
palate
head
is
a
bright
white
and
the
aroma
has
notes
of
noble
hops
like
a
good
pilsener
should
fantastic
carbonation
presentation
packaged
in
a
standard
twelveounce
brown
glass
longneck
bottle
served
in
a
new
belgium
brewing
chalice
overall
not
the
most
flavorful
pilsner
but
balanced
crisp
and
satisfying
especially
after
a
5k
run
when
consumed
was
not
overly
impressed
with
this
pilsner
as
compared
to
its
german
and
czech
counterparts
it
lacks
the
kick
and
complexity
of
the
european
pilsners
however
midway
through
drinking
the
addition
of
guacamole
and
chips
improved
the
taste
significantly
by
itself
this
is
not
an
exceptional
beer
but
under
the
right
circumstances
ie
with
a
spicy
meal
or
on
a
hot
summer
day
can
be
refreshing
an
allstar
example
bravo
brooklyn
3
months
past
bb
date
the
slight
skunk
of
pilsner
malt
is
accompanied
by
light
sweetness
and
floral
hops
malt
dominates
flavor
reveals
crackery
malt
at
the
base
with
sweetness
lingering
in
the
aftertaste
the
finish
ends
up
being
fairly
crisp
and
lightly
bitter
theres
an
underlying
tang
that
is
offputting
one
of
the
best
pilsner
beers
ive
had
unique
in
flavor
and
supreme
drinkability
i
havent
seen
a
six
pack
of
this
yet
but
when
i
do
i
will
definitely
get
it
nice
golden
pils
appearance
with
good
lacing
but
not
perfectly
clear
neutral
in
the
nose
no
marked
malt
or
hop
coming
through
seemed
a
bit
light
for
the
style
and
i
was
really
looking
for
the
perfect
balanced
crispness
you
get
with
a
world
class
pils
but
it
was
not
there
excellent
german
pilsner
with
hoppiness
not
often
enjoyed
in
this
style
overall
highly
quaffable
pilsner
its
not
crisp
and
bitter
like
a
czech
but
is
appropriately
rounded
like
a
german
version
of
the
style
i
think
it
is
a
success
overall
solid
german
pils
cant
go
wrong
with
brooklyn
only
scored
it
somewhat
low
because
im
biased
towards
czech
pils
which
showcases
the
hops
much
better
imho
o
really
good
for
a
style
thats
not
my
normal
go
to
pure
golden
blonde
very
clear
with
ample
bubbles
rising
from
the
bottom
of

poured
from
the

into
a

an

with

i
think
brooklyn
did
indeed
capture
some
preprohibition
flavor
here
not
overly
green
but
does
feature
a
more
rounded
floral
citrus
hop
note
almost
like
perfumed

with
a
sweeter
than
usual

backbone
moderately
carbonated
with

great
pils
in
my
book
i
dig
the
sweeter
malts
and
noticeable
fruity
hop
flavors
although
things
dont
stray
too
far
from
style
guidelines
top
notch
patio
beer
drinkable
in
quantity
o
pretty
much
what
i
expect
from
a
pilsner
very
refreshing
and
clean
definitely
worth
trying
oa
pretty
good
pilsener
not
my
favorite
i
prefer
the
dryer
more
grainy
pilseners
but
this
has
its
time
and
place
as
well
glad
i
tried
it
o
great
example
of
a
german
pilsner
with
an
american
hoppy
twist
pours
a
pale
golden
color
clear
and
with
a
fat
head
of
white
foam
the
appearance
is
perfection
some
bubbles
race
to
the
top
and
the
head
falls
slowly
leaving
lots
of
lacing
the
nose
is
sweet
grain
and
herbal
its
got
a
bit
of
hop
perfume
on
it
and
and
is
lightly
lemony
the
taste
is
clean
crisp
and
terrific
the
mouthfeel
is
creamy
but
the
carbonation
is
crisp
so
its
a
nice
tease
to
the
palate
the
grain
is
just
sweet
and
the
herbal
is
a
touch
spicy
the
lemony
hops
take
the
back
end
and
bring
this
to
a
medium
dry
finish
with
a
small
little
hint
of
bitter
lively
and
malty
this
has
plenty
of
flavor
to
keep
you
satisfied
as
you
drink
three
or
four
of
these
pours
a
nice
golden
sun
yellow
one
and
a
half
finger
head
that
falls
kinda
fast
decent
carbonation
smells
like
light
malts
hay
and
a
slight
hoppy
background
taste
follows
suit
nice
sweetness
from
the
malt
fruity
hop
notes
a
fresh
light
note
of
that
typical
pilsner
flavor
very
nicely
balanced
mouthfeel
is
slightly
thin
feels
like
you
can
drink
a
lot
without
feeling
full
overall
a
really
great
pils
very
happy
with
it
mouthfeel
light
bubbles
that
are

this

good
beer
in
the
end
still
a
decent
beer
it
does

the

a

overallt
he
brew
is
yummy
and
i
keep
ordering
this
they
are
able
to
price
it
so
high
because
brooklyn
uses
quality
ingredients
and
it
is
just
yummy
d
decent
but
i
would
stay
a
step
below
good
a
serious
lack

aromaflavorpresence
mostly
ruined
it
for
me
that
and
the
lack

not
really
much
of
a
fan
of
either
of
brooklyns
main
lager
beers
stick
to
your
ales
boys
overall
not
much
to
say
about
this
except
that
it
is
an
excellent
representation
of
a
german
pils
right
up
there
with
troegs
sunshine
pils
and
maybe
victory
prima
pils
for
domestic
craft
examples
of
german
pilsners
this
is
a
decent
beer
probably
its
biggest
issue
is
the
ridiculous
carbonation
level
probably
my
least
favorite
brooklyn
but
that
isnt
so
bad
i
was
really
surprised
by
this
beer
and
is
definitely
better
than
i
had

i
pretty

like
em

this
one
came
off

skunked

hops

from

that
stays
for

not
forever
smells
of
lightly
roasted

with
the
barley
standing
out
tastes
of
plain

much
stronger
and
with

beer
is
light
bodied
and
very
drinkable
as
is
expected
for
a
pilsner
and
carbonation
is
right
overall
a
very
good
beer
overall
not
a
bad
brew
it
was
rather
lacking
in
some
of
its

it
is
quite
refreshing

not

i
would
have
enjoyed
a

an

end
o
a

this
is
a
really
good
german
pilsener
i
live
in
hong
kong
and
we
have
quite
a
few
pilseners
from
germany
and
czechoslovakia
to
choose
from
but
very
few
beers
from
the
us
i
love
the
style
and
have
to
say
that
this
beer
is
very
true
to
it
it
has
a
lot
of
that
clean
pilsener
hop
flavor
that
i
love
a
bit
more
than
say
a
konig
krombacher
bitburger
or
even
a
rothaus
which
is
my
favorite
the
malts
and
hops
are
very
well
balanced
and
i
highly
recommend
this
beer
even
to
a
european
or
authentic
pilsener
fan
such
as
myself
i
was
shocked
by
how
good
this
beer
is
highly
recommended
overall
eh
not
really
what
i
expected
for
a
german
pilsner
too
much
sweetness
not
enough
of
the
lighter
toasty
straw
malts
hops
have
some
good
qualities
but
not
so
great
ones
as
well
the
taste
was
very
distracting
its
hop
finish
which
is
typical
of
this
style
contained
the
presence
of
floral
and
perfumy
tones
which
persisted
from
the
front
of
the
tongue
through
its
finish
although
this
dissipated
somewhat
its
prescense
never
left
the
bear
which
was
like
a
dark
cloud
on
a
beufiful
day
reminicent
of
a
skunky
heinekin
it
pours
golden
with
a
white
head
head
retention
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
the
body
is
hazy
smell
is
malty
and
a
little
fruity
it
tastes
pretty
good
balanced
and
relaxing
mouthfeel
is
on
point
too
overall
a
good
beer
that
i
want
to
have
on
draft
at
a
baseball
game
on
a
warm
summer
day
mouthfeeldrinkability
extremely
wallbalanced
and
sessionable
went
down
smooth
and
fast
avoided
the
skunky
hop
taste
that
ive
experienced
in
the
last
few
pilsners
i
have
tried
lightbodied
crisp
and
perfect
for
summer
interesting
that
brooklyn
proclaims
this
as
the
kind
of
pilsner
preferred
by
germanamerican
brewers
from
a
century
ago
and
not
like
the
traditional
homeland
german
pilsners
it
shows
in
that
it
isnt
a
good
example
of
the
current
deutsch
style
but
i
wouldnt
know
what
preprohibition
new
york
pils
tasted
like
anyways
no
matter
how
much
boardwalk
empire
i
watch
anyways
an
amenable
quaff
in
its
own
right
nice
to
see
it
amongst
its
siblings
on
alberta
store
shelves
this
is
a
beer
brewed
nicely
to
style
there
isnt
anything
of
import
really
to
note
its
crisp
clean
refreshing
flavorful
if
this
came
in
cans
it
would
make
a
perfect
poolside
beer
overall
drinkability
very
drinkable
probably
will
have
another
later
i
could
see
this
going
very
well
with
a
wide
range
of
food
and
went
pretty
well
with
oven
toasted
gruyere
and
caramelized
onion
open
faced
sandwiches
cleaned
the
strong
tastes
right
away
off
the
palate
and
complimented
the
flavors
well
also
a
very
good
pilsner
and
glad
i
bought
the
six
pack
o
i
guess
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
to
scream
about
from
what
ive
read
of
other
reviews
i
was
hoping
for
a
better
appearance
but
was
let
down
a
bit
id
probably
only
seek
this
out
again
if
i
found
it
on
tap
this
is
extremely
drinkable
and
pretty
tasty
its
not
exactly
what
i
was
expecting
however
as
it
seems
to
be
very
low
in
hoppiness
compared
to
other
pilseners
i
enjoyed
this
one
but
i
think
it
tastes
more
like
a
helles
than
a
pilsner
still
worth
trying
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
gold
with
no
heaad
or
lace
its
aroma
is
of
lemons
bread
and
a
hint
of
vanilla
the
flavor
is
lemony
with
grass
and
well
balanced
malt
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
smooth
just
right
for
the
style
brooklyn
pilsner
is
a
good
brew
and
a
great
match
for
sourdough
pretzels
recommended
o
an
easy
drinker
that
easy
crisp
and
tasty
i
like
so
many
of
brooklyns
beers
this
trends
towards
the
bottle
of
the
list
overall
a
very
nice
take
on
a

one

the
better

versions

good
perhaps
not
in
my
top
5
us
pilsners
but
very
well
done
if
you
are
a
pilsner
fan
very
well
balanced
and
refreshing
beer
i
could
easily
finish
the
whole
6pack
i
think
i
like
this
even
better
than
their
lager
d
not
bad
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
again
a
bit
heavier
maltwise
for
the
style
o
decent
pilsner
not
my
favorite
style
but
this
went
down
easy
overall
an
excellent
session
beer
that
many
people
could
enjoy
o
delicious
refreshing
i
highly
recommend
it
very
good
american
made
german
style
pilsner
o
solid
pils
b
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
best
by
date
of
july
2012
this
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
smells
are
a
little
of
grassy
hops
crisp
clean
and
malts
not
bad
the
feel
is
light
and
crisp
the
taste
is
some
of
the
same
light
and
crisp
some
light
hop
bite
and
very
clean
malts
o
nothing
particularly
groundbreaking
here
but
still
a
drinkable
beer
o
overall
an
above
average
pilsner
though
the
nose
is
a
bit
bland
easy
to
drink
and
some
nice
fruit
and
floral
notes
in
the
taste
would
drink
it
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
light
pilsner
overall
pretty
solid
no
complaints
o
an
average
german
pilsner
id
like
to
have
tasted
more
spice
profile
and
hop
profile
to
really
fit
in
with
the
style
this
tastes
more
like
an
american
pilsner
than
a
german
got
better
and
more
complex
as
it
warmed
up
o
a
good
beer
recommendable
a
really
great
american
pilsner
as
pilsners
go
pours
a
conventional
light
yellow
color
but
has
a
large
cloudlike
head
smells
like
more
than
the
traditional
pilsners
do
notes
of
vanilla
and
pitted
fruit
taste
is
on
the
sweeter
side
not
dry
at
all
really
nice
hop
additions
as
well
great
mediumlight
body
makes
this
a
notboring
pilser
to
session
definitely
one
of
the
more
inspired
versions
i
have
had
d
this
beer
is
simple
and
refreshing
for
the
style
i
think
the
flavor
is
overly
dominated
by
hops
but
its
tasty
no
less
a
real
good
quaff
right
to
style
and
easily
rivaling
the
more
mainstream
german
pilsners
the
hoppiness
here
has
won
me
over
purchased
at
wegmans
as
part
of
a
mixed
six
best
by
date
this
month
so
had
to
try
it
quick
poured
from
the
bottle
into
a
tall
pilsner
bright
shiny
color
moderate
carbonation
and
nice
clarity
foam
cap
lasted
a
minute
or
two
clean
aroma
with
some
malt
and
just
a
tiny
hop
presence
may
be
lighter
than
intended
due
to
the
freshness
good
basic
pilsner
flavor
easy
drinking
would
like
to
try
ontap
oh
and
bottle
said
brewed
in
utica
the
flavor
is
alright
not
traditional
but
not
bad
it
has
a
nice
balance
and
a
crisp
bitterness
in
the
finish
poured
this
german
pilsener
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
this
pilsener
poured
a
slightly
hazy
golden
color
it
produced
a
nice
white
head
retention
is
below
average
lacing
is
minimal
the
aroma
is
comprised
of
sweet
grain
and
a
touch
of
hops
the
beer
is
very
crisp
a
very
nice
bite
there
is
some
citrusy
lemony
hops
in
the
forefront
followed
by
bitter
malt
and
a
slightly
dry
finish
that
leaves
you
wanting
to
take
another
sip
very
nice
example
of
a
pilsner
according
to
the
label
an
attempt
at
a
preprohibition
german
lager
great
craft
brewed
pilsner
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
that
if
you
drink
enough
it
would
make
me
inclined
to
pick
up
a
hitchhiker
bob
evans
anyone
i
wondered
today
while
drinking
this
beer
if
pilsners
were
generally
disliked
amongst
the
otherwise
beerloving
public
i
wondered
this
question
because
i
cant
say
many
nice
things
about
it
myself
and
yet
it
persists
as
an
omnipresent
choice
amongst
fastmoving
shelves
at
a
highquality
price
judging
from
these
reviews
it
seems
pilsner
has
many
detractors
still
i
would
love
to
try
a
quality
version
of
this
style
i
poured
this
into
a
pilsner
glass
and
it
poured
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
the
beer
was
very
dry
and
moderately
hoppy
probably
a
decent
pislner
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
just
not
something
ive
crazy
about
bready
with
clean
pilsner
malt
almost
saltine
crackerlike
due
to
the
dryness
lemony
hops
with
a
mild
bitterness
that
tends
to
linger
flavor
is
good
though
slightly
bland
and
papery
outside
of
the
hop
character
light
bodied
crisp
and
dry
good
summer
session
beer
far
better
than
brooklyn
lager
this
one
has
a
stronger
malt
presence
than
any
of
the
other
pils
ive
had
and
i
enjoyed
it
definitely
sessionable
and
something
that
ill
probably
pick
up
in
the
future
on
a
hot
day
i
am
perturbed
by
beer
advocate
boys
review
am
i
wrong
i
look
forward
to
trying
other
brooklyn
styles
and
plan
to
make
room
in
the
fridge
for
brooklyn
lager
and
pilsener
the
remainder
of
the
summer
o
sweet
caramel
malts
and
bitter
floral
hops
combine
for
a
nicley
balanced
and
easy
drinking
pilsner
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
barely
a
14
inch
head
smell
is
straw
citrus
grass
light
body
nice
mouthfeel
with
good
carbonation
taste
is
clean
refreshing
a
little
cidery
in
a
good
way
some
malty
sweetness
a
little
grassy
hops
and
some
citrus
hop
flavor
but
not
assertive
finish
is
extremely
clean
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
i
like
it
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
this
i
will
buy
again
very
enjoyable
pilsners
are
great
and
this
is
good
d
very
good
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
from
an
american
brewery
impressive
most
impressive
overallim
the
first
one
to
admit
i
pass
by
pilseners
because
of
their
lack
of
flavor
however
this
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
the
style
impressed
overall
looks
great
as
the
lace
continues
throughout
more
flavor
that
i
expected
nice
contrast
between
the
grainy
malt
nose
and
grassy
flavors
poured
into
a
pint
glass
got
some
dark
golden
brew
with
a
small
white
head
as
a
cap
the
german
hops
give
this
a
straw
profile
which
i
both
expect
and
love
in
my
pilsners
straightforward
nothing
that
really
blows
me
away
but
sometimes
just
nice
is
a
beer
i
want
to
have
in
my
fridge
often
pair
it
with
some
bbq
and
theres
nothing
wrong
in
life
nice
light
body
here
with
lively
carbonation
overall
this
is
enjoyable
enough
but
there
are
a
gazillion
better
pilsners
on
the
market
transparent
golden
corn
color
with
white
frothy
head
that
stays
aroma
of
european
hops
grains
and
a
touch
of
honey
refreshing
flavors
of
hops
cereal
light
floral
slight
citrus
with
bitterness
and
dryness
towards
the
finish
light
in
body
with
light
carbonation
crisp
thirst
quenching
and
sessionable
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
an
offwhite
head
aroma
of
grassy
citrusy
hops
light
fruity
notes
with
some
malt
and
cereal
grains
make
a
presence
in
the
taste
palate
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
and
crisp
mouthfeel
finish
is
maltyeasty
grass
some
light
citrus
hops
and
a
bit
of
skunkyness
overall
an
ok
brew
pours
to
a
frothy
lacy
white
head
and
pale
gold
color
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
noble
hops
flavor
is
mild
with
a
balance
of
sweet
pale
malt
and
noble
hops
theres
a
slight
butteriness
and
fullness
of
flavor
akin
to
a
czech
pils
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
right
very
tasty
but
not
quite
as
sharp
as
most
german
pils
i
like
it
anyway
a
little
light
for
my
taste
but
overall
is
pretty
good
o
ive
been
trying
a
lot
of
americanmade
pilsners
as
of
late
to
compare
to
my
own
homebrew
pils
sadly
this
doesnt
seem
to
stack
up
to
others
ive
had
recently
dont
get
me
wrong
its
not
a
bad
beer
but
its
not
a
good
one
drinkable
and
refreshing
though
not
a
brew
id
go
back
to
a
clear
yellow
with
a
dense
white
head
with
excellent
retention
and
lacing
this
is
a
gorgeous
beer
the
nose
is
chockfull
of
doughy
and
crackerlike
malt
theres
some
honey
as
well
and
the
hop
character
is
surprisingly
restrained
with
a
blend
of
floral
and
earthy
with
a
little
lemon
the
hops
are
much
more
assertive
on
the
palate
opening
with
a
blend
of
spicy
hop
flavor
and
doughy
bready
malt
this
beer
has
a
very
rustic
malt
character
particularly
bitter
on
the
finish
with
some
lemon
peel
this
beer
is
light
in
body
and
is
amply
carbonated
the
bitterness
is
too
high
for
the
style
imo
but
apart
from
that
this
is
a
solid
pils
a
very
solid
pilsner
glad
i
got
to
try
this
maybe
it
doesnt
stack
up
against
others
ive
had
but
when
paired
with
the
right
food
its
really
quite
good
its
rare
that
i
buy
a
pilsner
from
outside
of
my
home
state
so
i
picked
up
one
of
these
to
broaden
my
horizons
very
nice
looking
pils
crystal
clear
and
golden
with
a
decent
foamy
head
smell
is
grainy
grassy
and
floral
palate
is
crisp
and
bitter
with
a
balanced
hop
to
malt
flavor
ratio
earthy
and
grainy
with
just
a
hint
of
sweetness
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
mildly
dry
and
very
lively
in
the
end
this
was
much
better
than
i
expected
but
wont
be
a
regular
in
my
fridge
theres
just
too
many
great
local
pilsners
that
are
a
notch
or
two
better
solid
flavor
too
with
more
cracker
maltiness
and
a
bit
of
toasted
bread
crust
hops
taste
grassy
and
bitter
while
the
finish
is
all
mineral
water
mouthfeel
is
appropriate
for
the
style
thin
body
bubbly
carbonation
juicycrisp
finish
just
a
superbly
made
pilsner
nothing
to
see
here
overall
this
is
very
easy
to
drink
gone
before
i
knew
it
i
can
see
this
being
a
great
beer
for
any
occasion
quite
sessionable
taste
has
a
nice
balance
of
light
grainy
malt
and
grassy
hop
flavor
decent
bitterness
throws
a
bite
on
the
finish
freshness
is
key
here
and
is
quite
the
thirst
quencher
i
like
it
glad
brooklyn
brought
this
one
into
tx
recently
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
sessionable
this
is
a
pretty
solid
and
easy
drinking
pils
and
theres
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
that
for
me
however
there
are
a
number
of
better
ones
that
are
just
as
if
not
more
accessible
here
in
eastern
pa
so
i
dont
think
ill
find
myself
reaching
for
this
with
any
regularity
a
solid
brew
however
that
id
be
happy
to
knock
back
on
draft
if
i
saw
it
on
the
menu
pale
golden
colour
tight
one
finger
of
sticky
head
some
lace
on
the
glass
smells
slightly
hoppy
grassy
some
malt
light
lemony
citrus
nice
light
fresh
nose
taste
is
of
crisp
hop
grassy
notes
come
back
solid
malt
finish
pretty
clean
brew
thin
mouthfeel
slightly
watery
very
crisp
carbonation
drinks
very
nicely
i
probably
wouldnt
orderbuy
this
all
the
time
but
it
would
be
a
good
beer
from
time
to
time
in
the
warm
weather
moreys
bottom
line
a
pretty
good
representation
of
the
style
nothing
groundbreaking
but
its
good
it
only
runs
8
99
a
sixer
here
in
erie
which
is
pretty
good
poured
a
nice
golden
amber
a
bit
darker
then
i
would
have
thought
and
that
is
good
a
nice
fluffy
pillow
like
white
head
graced
the
top
to
a
height
of
about
two
inches
before
settling
back
down
to
just
some
lace
ringing
the
glass
a
touch
of
which
stuck
around
for
a
while
great
visible
carbonation
evident
in
streams
of
bubbles
filtering
up
from
the
bottom
smell
was
light
lots
of
grain
with
some
hints
of
maybe
corn
or
an
earthy
cereal
but
nothing
spectacular
taste
was
good
you
typical
pilsner
light
on
the
flavor
big
on
carbonation
smooth
crisp
mouthfeel
not
a
real
lingering
flavor
but
what
was
there
was
lots
of
grain
and
corn
maybe
something
else
but
it
was
hard
to
place
very
sessionable
as
it
was
very
light
all
together
a
good
summer
drinker
i
have
had
better
but
it
is
definatly
not
bad
looking
forward
to
hitting
up
some
more
drinkability
seems
to
go
a
long
way
with
this
one
i
could
drink
this
all
day
if
i
needed
to
or
wanted
to
basically
its
a
great
beer
to
keep
in
the
fridge
or
best
to
get
on
tap
at
the
brewery
d
very
drinkable
great
summersession
beer
d
thats
this
beers
strong
point
would
pair
wonderfully
with
many
foods
and
is
tasty
enough
to
drink
a
few
on
its
own
d
good
drinkability
here
it
is
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
i
think
it
would
be
great
to
enjoy
on
a
hot
summer
day
im
going
to
have
to
get
some
more
of
these
when
summer
rolls
around
i
recommend
giving
it
a
shot
refreshing
mouthfeel
with
a
nice
hop
bite
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
tingle
dreally
drinkable
would
be
even
better
in
the
summer
but
i
am
not
going
to
turn
down
a
beer
at
a
friends
house
normally
i
dont
drink
pilsner
but
i
decided
to
try
one
from
brooklyn
the
brewery
i
like
12
ounce
bottle
pours
a
hazy
goldenamber
color
with
a
nice
lacy
head
aroma
of
floral
hops
with
hints
of
citrus
and
malts
flavor
is
mild
for
pilsner
hops
upfront
balanced
by
some
maltiness
finish
is
short
dry
with
grapefruit
notes
ok
beer
but
expected
more
from
brooklyn
d
i
could
drink
these
all
night
one
of
the
few
beers
id
ever
have
the
urge
or
ability
to
drink
more
than
six
of
i
really
like
this
beer
as
a
session
beer
theres
nothing
spectacular
about
it
but
being
the
first
time
ive
tried
it
i
know
ill
be
coming
back
to
it
real
real
solid
beer
here
simple
reliable
drink
a
very
enjoyable
beer
that
reminded
me
a
little
of
victorys
primia
pils
although
not
as
good
its
an
above
average
brew
that
im
happy
i
tried
id
really
like
to
try
this
one
on
tap
overall
fairly
disappointed
on
this
one
i
dont
know
what
i
expected
exactly
but
i
didnt
get
anything
i
would
want
to
try
again
brooklyn
can
be
a
little
hit
or
miss
sometimes
and
this
one
was
a
miss
id
go
elsewhere
if
pilseners
are
your
thing
across
the
board
good
beer
very
drinkable
and
of
course
a
darling
for
food
pairing
green
and
light
pasta
salads
nonwhite
fish
and
grilled
pork
or
chicken
d
a
solid
beer
that
is
subtle
but
not
boring
i
continually
appreciate
what
brooklyn
brewery
brings
to
the
table
a
consistent
golden
yelle
pilz
with
a
new
big
white
head
and
some
lace
but
nothing
amazing
well
done
and
end
of
story
nose
more
of
lemon
west
than
some
has
the
bitter
finish
of
that
munich
malt
with
the
mild
woodiness
otherwise
hoppier
crisp
not
floral
but
lemon
dry
pine
clears
the
palate
and
induces
an
appetite
so
i
cant
complain
but
i
you
like
a
tad
more
latitude
not
gravity
feel
is
great
but
a
broader
finish
good
york
though
a
hard
style
to
get
right
good
beer
could
drink
a
bunch
i
had
this
following
the
bitburger
and
thought
this
was
a
notch
below
but
solid
these
would
be
a
great
choice
for
a
summer
session
ive
always
been
impressed
by
brooklyn
beers
d
an
easy
drinking
refreshing
pilsner
d
goes
down
easily
not
filling
well
balanced
certainly
a
nice
beer
to
sit
with
for
a
while
especially
on
a
warm
evening
notesi
enjoyed
this
beer
on
one
of
the
hottest
nights
new
york
has
seen
i
went
for
a
swim
and
enjoyed
a
few
of
these
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
day
of
the
year
to
be
enjoying
this
great
beer
poured
a
translucent
golden
hue
into
pilsener
glass
with
heavy
carbonation
one
finger
of
white
and
decent
head
retention
and
lacing
the
smell
wasnt
as
herbalbitter
noble
hoppy
as
i
had
expected
a
little
more
malty
and
maybe
sweetish
the
taste
confirmed
that
something
was
missing
either
in
the
form
of
a
less
pronounced
grain
bill
or
a
more
pronounced
noble
hops
bill
that
being
said
it
did
finish
on
a
crisp
dry
note
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
thin
side
and
highly
carbonated
definitely
a
decent
session
pilsener
but
i
would
suggest
working
on
the
hopmalt
balance
d
very
refreshing
pils
i
dont
have
much
to
say
other
than
this
is
a
great
beer
in
a
category
im
not
otherwise
familiar
with
now
im
interested
in
the
great
german
pilsener
once
again
pure
clean
simple
good
tastebiscuit
with
a
spicy
hop
bite
up
front
that
lingers
to
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshing
a
worthy
session
beer
would
make
a
nice
entrylevel
brew
into
the
craft
world
d
over
the
past
few
months
ive
been
more
and
more
attracted
to
lighter
bodied
german
style
beers
and
this
one
definitely
feeds
my
hunger
summer
practically
here
i
will
be
keeping
this
one
around
thanks
to
dave
from
heidelberg
for
the
samples
d
another
great
offering
from
brooklyn
i
would
even
venture
to
say
that
this
is
a
better
brew
than
their
flagship
lager
if
only
americans
appreciated
a
well
made
pils
d
most
excellent
drinkability
was
very
impressed
that
it
was
in
fact
a
pilsner
it
is
in
a
class
all
its
own
a
deserves
all
the
great
recognition
this
beer
will
receive
if
it
hasnt
already
so
grab
your
favorite
beer
mug
crack
open
a
brooklyn
pilsner
and
get
ready
to
be
impressed
maybe
i
just
had
a
more
summery
lager
in
mind
cause
its
not
a
bad
beer
by
any
standard
maybe
more
of
a
winter
time
pils
d
light
refreshing
and
smooth
not
a
lot
of
flavor
going
on
but
i
could
easily
drink
a
few
of
these
and
finished
the
beer
before
i
finished
my
2
slices
beer
went
well
with
the
pizza
btw
very
easy
to
drink
kind
of
a
mindless
beer
when
you
wanna
throw
a
couple
back
pours
a
very
light
transparent
amber
color
with
a
one
finger
head
that
leaves
a
lot
of
lacing
the
nose
is
heavy
on
malt
and
grain
and
a
slight
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
very
grainy
with
a
slight
bit
of
malt
sweetness
and
a
touch
of
hops
very
watery
and
lacking
in
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
but
its
not
a
very
drinkable
brew
and
one
of
my
least
favorite
from
brooklyn
which
is
a
brewery
i
like
a
lot
d
pretty
decent
pilsner
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
just
easy
drinking
this
is
one
of
the
better
craft
pilsners
on
the
market
it
leans
towards
the
bready
and
malty
end
of
the
spectrum
while
remaining
crisp
and
bitter
d
good
pilsner
great
for
a
warm
day
not
quite
as
good
as
victorys
prima
pils
or
sam
adams
noble
pils
but
close
enough
to
be
included
in
the
discussion
these
american
pilsners
are
making
me
want
to
try
the
authentic
german
versions
fresh
some
day
dsolid
lager
with
pretty
good
flavors
and
a
nice
balance
clean
and
crisp
drinking
very
sessionalbe
buy
again
no
taste
is
rather
unique
for
an
american
pils
the
hops
are
very
background
but
the
maltiness
comes
out
florally
but
not
overly
sweet
the
slight
bitterness
of
the
hops
come
in
as
a
nice
after
thought
mouthfeel
shows
off
a
nice
balance
of
smoothness
and
carbonation
rendering
this
quite
drinkable
not
one
of
my
favorite
types
of
brew
but
definitely
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
ever
had
overall
a
pretty
sessionable
beer
that
brings
lots
of
flavor
to
the
table
without
sacrificing
some
of
the
backbone
of
the
pilsner
style
a
solid
beer
all
around
drinkability
a
nice
and
hoppy
pils
not
the
best
i
have
had
but
certainly
good
i
could
have
three
or
so
especially
on
a
hot
day
drinkability
the
carbonation
and
not
clean
finish
turn
into
a
beer
that
is
close
to
but
not
exactly
what
i
am
looking
for
in
a
german
pilsner
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
rather
refreshing
a
gold
color
with
just
a
hint
of
haziness
medium
sized
white
head
little
bit
of
lacing
it
had
a
sweet
outdoorsy
aroma
grass
and
flowers
malt
taste
up
front
with
some
late
sharp
hops
crisp
beer
easy
drinking
had
three
of
these
in
short
order
such
a
great
quaffer
right
behind
a
hefe
for
sessioning
its
not
a
bad
drop
and
its
very
clean
and
crisp
but
it
lacks
a
lot
of
the
true
pilsener
characters
that
would
make
it
really
good
as
it
stands
i
think
its
the
lesser
of
it
and
the
brooklyn
lager
which
i
find
a
little
confusing
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
this
isnt
the
first
pilsener
that
i
would
choose
but
its
still
a
solid
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
drinkability
great
session
beer
and
a
very
good
representation
of
its
style
hoppy
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
therefore
it
may
not
satisfy
hopheads
fully
but
still
provides
a
decent
hop
fix
drinkability
a
highly
drinkable
pilsner
worth
a
try
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
perhaps
a
little
darker
than
the
classics
of
the
style
a
nice
foamy
head
recedes
into
thin
lace
a
nice
hop
aroma
with
some
cut
grass
a
little
spicy
but
definitely
a
bready
malt
backbone
fresh
and
clean
on
the
palate
a
refreshing
bitterness
is
balanced
by
a
slight
maltiness
the
beer
exits
fast
and
again
bitter
leaving
a
lasting
dryness
across
the
palate
not
a
bad
pilsner
kind
of
lacking
in
taste
especially
compared
to
prima
pils
and
troegs
not
a
bad
effort
though
notes
i
confess
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
but
this
is
a
good
brew
very
pleasing
to
be
had
and
clearly
shines
above
the
average
macro
offering
and
quite
a
few
largers
and
pilsners
around
great
beer
to
offer
to
guests
used
to
macros
to
get
them
gently
into
a
different
range
of
beers
it
has
worked
like
a
charm
in
that
regard
everytime
so
far
a
regular
in
my
fridge
during
a
good
part
of
the
year
drinkability
is
average
this
is
really
just
an
average
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
its
slightly
higher
quality
than
your
generic
but
its
cheap
and
it
pairs
well
with
all
sorts
of
summer
food
and
events
fairly
lively
carbonation
lacking
something
in
the
body
needs
to
be
a
bit
cleaner
not
the
best
craft
pilsner
out
there
but
still
a
good
pick
for
summer
grilling
etc
not
my
favorite
style
actually
probably
my
least
liked
but
a
good
example
of
the
style
with
a
bit
more
flavor
this
beer
is
a
clean
clear
gold
color
with
a
nice
bright
white
head
that
appears
to
be
lingering
nicely
the
nose
is
a
bit
restrained
but
i
do
get
a
bit
of
floral
hop
with
a
touch
of
grainy
malt
the
taste
is
a
good
blend
of
light
sweet
grain
and
the
floral
grassy
hop
bitterness
is
never
overpowering
but
is
enough
to
balance
the
malt
everything
is
carried
along
with
a
fine
and
fairly
lively
carbonation
that
keeps
things
pretty
smooth
in
general
the
taste
while
good
may
be
missing
a
bit
of
assertiveness
id
also
like
it
if
the
beer
was
a
bit
cleaner
there
is
a
little
more
residual
flavor
than
i
would
like
for
a
beer
of
this
style
drinkability
is
good
but
the
beer
is
not
a
premier
example
of
the
style
dvery
good
ill
ave
to
have
a
couple
more
d
i
must
admit
i
was
moderately
disappointed
when
my
sister
purchased
this
but
its
delicious
and
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
get
some
when
youre
in
new
york
in
the
summer
notes
this
is
a
very
clean
and
highly
drinkable
pilsner
and
it
is
great
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
notgreat
runofthemill
offering
soft
amber
color
and
an
offwhite
head
that
stayed
around
for
a
while
leaving
behind
a
nice
amount
of
lacing
pleasant
and
malty
in
the
nose
with
some
citrusy
hops
and
a
bit
of
sugar
rather
flat
body
and
an
overlyhopped
taste
that
managed
to
have
a
pleasant
dryness
but
not
enough
to
overcome
the
bland
taste
drinkable
and
enjoyable
under
the
right
circumstances
but
on
the
whole
blah
taste
is
a
medium
bodied
pilsner
with
the
barley
there
again
some
sugar
a
smooth
taste
all
around
mouthfeel
is
faintly
sweet
with
that
corn
field
swishing
about
your
palate
this
pilsner
from
brooklyn
is
better
than
the
macro
pilsners
but
i
wish
the
quality
was
little
higher
considering
how
good
some
of
their
other
beer
is
this
is
a
good
brew
the
characters
are
fresh
and
clean
i
dont
understand
why
i
got
such
a
good
pour
when
the
consensus
is
that
my
experience
is
not
at
all
typical
drinkability
this
is
a
nicely
drinkable
pilsner
i
could
easily
have
several
and
i
like
this
well
enough
ill
be
buying
more
in
the
future
this
is
a
good
versatile
beer
that
i
can
drink
no
matter
what
season
good
inside
on
a
cold
winter
evening
good
outside
in
june
at
a
bbq
overall
crisp
and
delicious
this
would
be
a
great
baseball
tailgating
beer
d
a
nice
little
pilsner
from
brooklyn
these
guys
remind
me
a
lot
of
samuel
adams
a
big
massproduced
line
of
interesting
styles
some
of
which
are
well
done
and
others
of
which
leave
something
to
be
desired
this
has
to
rank
near
the
top
of
their
regular
line
however
fairly
refreshing
on
a
muggy
night
like
tonight
dr
a
good
tasting
beer
but
not
remarkable
a
few
would
go
down
pretty
easily
pours
a
pale
yellow
very
fizzy
big
foamy
white
head
that
slowly
leaves
still
it
leaves
good
lacing
smells
of
grass
and
malt
nothing
overpowering
aroma
of
a
typical
pilsner
taste
is
very
smooth
flavors
of
maltwith
a
maltymetalic
taste
its
very
drinkible
but
doesnt
have
anything
really
exciting
going
for
it
its
a
good
summer
beer
but
not
anything
i
would
seek
out
its
also
not
overhopped
in
the
end
and
to
the
most
part
medium
bodied
making
it
a
harmonious
pilsener
if
there
ever
was
one
probably
one
of
my
highest
ranked
lagers
picked
up
a
single
of
this
at
total
wine
by
perimeter
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
minimal
head
or
lacing
smell
is
earthy
and
grassy
tastes
slightly
hoppy
metallic
and
grassy
moderate
carbonation
in
the
mouth
slightly
watery
but
its
a
pilsner
so
whos
complaining
overall
an
average
pilsner
at
first
look
it
was
a
nice
deep
gold
with
a
thick
head
the
head
left
good
lacing
while
drinking
it
had
a
nice
light
hint
of
hops
and
malts
scent
nothing
to
overpowering
tasted
good
again
nothing
to
overpowering
i
did
get
a
taste
of
a
slight
roast
of
malts
maybe
i
am
wrong
drinkalbity
is
great
and
easy
to
throw
them
back
on
a
warm
day
cheers
a
great
pilsener
smooth
slightly
more
of
a
medium
body
with
a
bitter
dry
aftertaste
although
i
expected
the
beer
to
have
a
lighter
body
than
it
did
clean
and
crisp
with
really
good
drinkability
and
refreshing
brooklyn
again
produced
another
quality
beer
that
i
will
be
enjoying
more
of
during
the
summer
months
this
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
color
perhaps
a
little
darker
than
the
classics
of
the
style
a
nice
foamy
head
recedes
into
thin
lace
a
nice
hop
aroma
with
some
cut
grass
a
little
spicy
but
definitely
a
bready

balanced
by
a
slight
maltiness
the
beer
exits
fast

again
bitter
leaving
a
lasting
dryness
across
the

refreshing
and
great
as
an
aperitif
or
just
to
have
in
fridge
this
is
a
very
good
drinking
beer
easy
all
the
way
around
d
highly
drinkable
pretty
good
example
of
the
style
the
fiancee
likes
it
overall
i
should
try
to
get
my
light
beer
drinking
father
to
try
this
one
its
not
very
complex
but
it
tastes
enjoyable
enough
and
is
not
heavy
at
all
a
good
gateway
to
craft
beer
easydrinking
but
lacking
in
the
nose
the
diacetyl
character
is
certainly
undesireable
in
such
a
brew
perhaps
this
is
isolated
and
can
be
attributed
to
other
factors
in
the
age
of
the
keg
or
the
tap
lines
but
either
way
aside
from
that
it
is
a
fairly
nicely
crafted
pilsner
d
high
drinkability
as
with
most
pils
but
this
one
has
some
solid
flavor
and
character
to
it
while
still
retaining
the
cleanness
expected
from
the
style
drinkability
possibly
my
favorite
pilsner
so
far
which
might
not
be
saying
much
as
theyre
far
from
my
favorite
style
definitely
a
beer
i
feel
might
be
good
to
introduce
to
someone
trying
to
gradually
bridge
the
gap
from
macro
lagers
to
craft
beer
d
easily
drinkable
and
could
be
a
new
goto
beer
for
the
spring
and
summer
drinkability
excellent
this
is
easy
drinking
simple
and
enjoyable
i
will
definitely
buy
more
md
light
to
medium
bodied
plenty
of
carbonation
makes
this
very
drinkable
and
with
the
5
abv
deffinatly
a
session
beer
i
would
like
to
try
this
again
in
the
summer
the
taste
was
of
good
mix
of
hops
and
spice
slightly
bitter
very
smooth
almost
like
an
oktoberfest
would
taste
like
good
balance
but
could
use
a
little
more
bitterness
to
it
d
theres
no
questions
that
its
easy
to
drink
i
find
pilsners
to
be
quite
sessionable
and
this
is
no
exception
nothing
outstanding
just
a
solid
pilsner
very
pale
yellow
color
with
an
orange
tint
to
it
clear
enough
to
see
the
diffuse
bubbles
on
their
way
to
making
a
thin
white
foam
across
the
surface
crisp
and
invigorating
nose
of
hops
grapefruit
pith
cigar
ash
dried
corn
oats
not
truly
complex
but
its
freshness
keeps
you
pleased
lightbodied
with
an
enduring
bitterness
which
dries
out
your
throat
in
such
a
way
that
you
take
another
sip
to
try
and
wet
it
down
some
orange
and
grapefruit
citrus
present
little
malt
or
any
sort
of
sweetness
grains
and
straw
cant
lose
that
suggestion
of
ash
the
carbonation
level
is
moderately
high
and
adds
to
the
overall
high
tone
stylistically
correct
requires
both
high
summer
temperatures
and
the
outdoors
to
show
best
still
not
sure
you
could
put
down
more
than
three
bottles
before
needing
to
drink
a
gallon
of
water
bright
golden
pilsner
with
a
big
sudsy
pillow
top
with
staying
power
smells
sweet
tastes
sweet
and
feels
crisp
and
turns
a
quick
biting
bitter
the
bitter
doesnt
last
long
as
the
dry
finish
just
makes
me
take
another
sip
a
solid
american
offering
of
the
german
pilsner
style

my
favorite
from
the
brooklyn
line
malty
aroma
golden
colored
carbonated
flavor
malty
some
citrus
well
rounded
for
a
pilsner
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
this
style
for
pretty
obvious
reasons
the
weak
watery
pilsner
is
dominant
in
america
in
the
form
of
budweisercoors
lightmiller
lite
however
this
is
a
very
good
effort
and
easily
the
best
pilsner
ive
ever
had
the
tatse
is
light
crisply
malty
and
hoppy
with
bread
herbs
and
a
hint
of
lemon
its
lightly
sweet
with
a
light
bitterness
dominating
the
finish
and
lingering
slightly
a
previous
delivery
of
the
botmc
that
brings
beer
to
my
doorstep
without
lifting
a
finger
smell
is
very
malty
with
a
hallertaulike
subdued
hoppiness
pours
to
a
yellow
golden
colour
with
a
shaving
cream
head
that
leaves
lacing
taste
is
very
sweet
as
anticipated
from
the
smell
start
is
sweet
but
quickly
gets
into
some
bitterness
that
doesnt
linger
at
full
strength
but
stays
a
little
longer
than
expected
for
a
pilsener
the
finish
is
a
nice
gradual
dryness
not
abrupt
like
macro
pilseners
good
range
of
flavors
for
a
pilsener
a
usually
simple
brew
style
hats
off
to
brooklyn
this
one
that
has
fresh
and
more
complex
flavor
id
pair
this
one
with
a
real
cheesy
mushroom
quiche
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
about
a
finger
or
so
of
white
head
that
lingers
briefly
pleasant
aroma
a
light
grainy
pils
malt
character
nearly
like
a
graham
cracker
with
a
bit
of
subtle
spicy
hoppiness
taste
is
quite
good
solidly
bitter
throughout
with
some
nice
pils
malt
undertones
with
only
hints
of
spicy
hop
flavor
finishes
relatively
dry
with
a
lingering
bitterness
mediumlight
to
light
body
with
mediumhigh
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
very
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
characterized
by
a
solid
lingering
bitterness
and
a
good
balance
between
pils
malt
and
noble
hop
character
very
enjoyable
something
ill
try
to
keep
in
my
fridge
d
a
nice
well
hopped
interpreation
of
style
not
one
i
would
consider
a
classic
by
style
but
worthy
of
checking
out
i
enjoy
this
the
aromas
are
light
malt
backbone
with
a
grassy
hop
aroma
the
taste
is
crisp
up
front
followed
by
a
creamy
sweet
malt
character
that
then
goes
to
a
lemon
bitterness
that
rides
out
for
a
bit
leaving
plenty
of
flavor
on
the
tongue
i
would
rank
the
drinkability
high
but
that
is
what
a
pilsner
should
be
this
is
not
the
greatest
pilsner
ive
ever
had
but
it
also
doesnt
appear
to
have
any
flawsat
least
from
my
palate
the
flavor
is
a
perfect
balance
of
sweet
and
bitter
for
all
its
luxuriousness
its
a
little
bit
dull
maybe
an
ultrafresh
bottle
but
then
ive
notice
the
same
sort
of
quality
in
brooklyns
octoberfest
a
certain
muted
aspect
still
a
very
solid
brew
and
quite
drinkable
kinda
reminds
me
of
boston
ale
yeah
this
drinks
a
bit
more
like
an
ale
than
a
lager
not
unlike
brooklyn
lager
note
right
after
having
this
i
had
a
boston
ale
there
are
similarities
to
be
sure
but
the
ale
is
over
the
top
with
softness
and
dull
sourness
the
brooklyn
would
be
my
choice
between
the
two
brooklyn
hardly
ever
gets
it
wrong
i
like
this
beer
but
it
is
not
very
pilsnery
its
got
more
in
common
with
a
marzenoktoberfest
or
vienna
lager
this
fits
right
into
my
pilsener
love
affair
will
be
grabbing
more
this
gets
lower
ratings
apparently
but
this
doesnt
fall
short
of
many
others
that
top
the
style
perhaps
pikeland
and
prima
deserves
respect
the
more
you
drink
the
better
it
tastes
an
easydrinking
brew

lately
ive
been
looking
for
beers
that
would
be
great
for
the
summer
and
something
to
store
in
my
golf
bag
this
fits
the
bill
golden
colored
pours
some
head
and
lace
but
not
a
lot
sweet
lemon
malt
aroma
not
overpowering
but
theres
enough
there
very
well
balanced
and
smooth
crisp
mild
hop
bite
with
a
floral
flavor
and
even
some
hints
on
honey
lately
my
success
rate
hasnt
been
all
that
great
with
new
beers
so
it
was
very
nice
to
get
something
i
really
did
enjoy
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
touch
of
nutty
caramel
color
to
it
great
bone
white
two
finger
head
the
pour
that
slyly
recedes
to
a
ring
o
foam
around
the
top
of
the
beer
the
aroma
is
a
nice
clean
hop
lime
and
some
brisk
dry
malts
the
taste
has
a
soft
touch
of
dry
toasted
bread
the
hops
impart
some
floral
notes
and
some
gentle
earthy
grassy
that
blends
goes
well
with
the
malts
and
boost
up
the
palate
and
drinkability
and
sessionablilty
of
this
beer
i
would
love
if
this
beer
was
available
at
lunar
all
year
round
very
good
americangerman
pilsner
d
good
drinker
a
nice
summer
postlawnmowing
beer
or
as
i
had
it
sitting
on
the
porch
after
a
day
at
the
beach
bottle
came
in
one
of
those
beer
of
the
month
club
mixed
12
packs
i
always
am
suspect
of
the
conditions
in
the
shipping
and
warehouse
facilities
i
am
drinking
it
on
august
first
and
it
has
a
best
by
date
of
november
from
a
bottle
it
pours
a
nice
copper
color
now
im
looking
at
the
category
and
the
german
pilsner
is
supposed
by
be
much
lighter
light
straw
or
golden
a
respectable
head
but
not
particularly
dense
the
smell
is
pleasant
but
cant
make
out
the
hops
first
swig
really
gives
off
an
unpleasant
metalic
taste
wonder
if
this
may
have
suffered
from
mishandling
during
shipping
as
i
drink
the
beer
what
i
first
considered
metalic
seems
to
mellow
and
gets
less
objectionable
but
still
not
on
style
the
hops
are
in
the
background
can
tell
the
balance
is
close
but
not
quite
there
got
better
the
more
of
it
i
drank
the
citrus
notes
of
the
hops
began
to
come
out
left
a
very
dry
crisp
mouthfeel
it
is
okay
but
i
dont
really
think
its
to
style
which
explains
my
lower
score
a
fine
beer
perfect
for
the
summer
time
easy
to
drink
like
i
say
if
you
dont
mind
alittle
flavor
in
your
pils
very
tasty
certainly
one
of
the
best
american
versions
of
the
style
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
balanced
level
of
uniform
brilliance
as
victorys
prima
pils
but
its
damn
close
tastes
crisp
citrus
hops
goes
down
really
well
one
of
the
best
pilsners
i
have
had
to
date
i
could
drink
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
in
front
of
my
grill
clear
dull
gold
in
color
with
a
cap
of
fine
white
fuzz
sweetly
floral
nose
lightly
fruity
grain
and
some
spicy
hops
flavors
are
lightly
sweet
and
floral
with
nice
saltine
cracker
malt
base
and
bunches
of
spicy
nobles
lightmedium
body
good
buzz
to
fresh
carbonation
crispy
one
of
the
better
germanstyle
pilsners
ive
had
big
spicy
kick
to
it
like
it
md
light
bodied
and
very
crisp
a
drinkable
pilsner
but
the
aftertaste
is
a
little
too
much
d
easy
to
drink
definitely
works
for
these
hot
summer
days
d
a
very
good
choice
for
hot
summer
days
low
abv
a
great
session
beer
recommended
tasted
on
62508
d
a
nice
pilsner
i
like
small
craft
warning
from
clipper
city
brewing
better
but
this
is
the
next
best
in
the
americanmade
pilsner
bunch
a
wellexecuted
beer
d
not
my
favorite
from
brooklyn
and
definitely
not
my
favorite
pilsner
i
would
not
repeat
again
i
usually
like
brooklyns
beers
but
this
one
is
an
exception
maybe
it
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
nobody
in
my
hometown
drinks
anything
but
american
swill
but
i
suspect
that
this
one
had
been
in
the
case
for
a
while
the
lager
i
bought
with
it
has
a
best
before
date
of
march
07
so
this
one
is
probably
about
the
same
will
need
to
revisit
this
beer
with
a
fresh
bottle
d
flavorful
and
refreshing
this
is
one
of
the
first
true
pilsners
ive
enjoyed
drinking
very
well
done
excellent
beer
for
a
hot
summer
day
nothing
extraordinary
in
this
beer
not
a
bad
pilsner
a
bit
more
tart
than
i
would
have
liked
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
some
initial
white
frothy
head
that
dissipates
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
hardly
any
retention
at
first
the
aroma
was
quite
hoppy
im
thinking
saaz
hops
but
as
the
beer
settled
the
more
floral
honeyed
notes
came
out
there
is
a
bit
of
grainy
husk
in
the
nose
quite
characteristic
of
a
pilsner
the
taste
is
sweetish
in
the
mid
section
a
bit
honey
and
floral
but
not
all
that
lemony
the
peppery
tartness
really
raises
itself
towards
the
finish
and
it
lingers
into
the
aftertaste
the
beer
is
reasonably
crisp
there
is
a
touch
of
butteryness
in
the
middle
as
well
the
beer
is
fairly
light
not
much
creaminess
at
all
and
it
lacks
biscuity
malts
there
is
a
dryishness
as
the
beer
segues
into
the
finish
and
the
initial
sweetness
departs
mouthfeel
is
a
product
of
the
lingering
peppery
tartness
fairly
watery
this
is
an
okay
beer
nothing
spectacular
notes
got
this
one
from
dyan
thanks
this
is
a
great
domestic
pils
that
id
gladly
drink
again
even
though
the
carbonation
is
only
moderate
this
pilsner
is
sharp
and
straight
beyond
that
the
beer
is
very
thin
and
honestly
not
that
interesting
not
the
best
brooklyn
nor
the
best
american
pils
although
vaguely
pilsnerish
in
its
bitterness
as
opposed
to
tasting
like
a
typical
cascadeloaded
american
ale
d
an
excellent
summer
time
beer
very
flavorful
and
refreshing
would
be
good
for
sessions
too
a
good
but
not
great
pils
i
would
pick
prima
pils
over
this
but
wouldnt
avoid
it
in
the
stores
or
turn
it
down
if
offered
dry
mouthfeel
this
is
certainly
a
very
refreshing
beer
great
to
have
in
the
summer
the
low
abv
makes
it
very
sessionable
as
well
clear
golden
nice
ring
with
thin
lace
lively
carbonation
bready
malts
with
some
grassy
hop
aromas
also
detecting
some
butterscotch
aroma
bready
malt
hints
of
honey
again
some
buttery
flavor
slight
grassy
hops
on
the
finish
gotta
beleve
diacetyl
is
involved
here
too
bad
as
i
was
enjoying
the
malt
and
hop
profile
and
this
seemed
to
be
a
nicely
hopped
pils
note
this
is
the
third
sample
of
this
over
the
last
two
nites
i
was
hoping
the
first
two
might
have
been
the
exception
the
rest
of
this
six
pack
will
be
returning
to
the
store
ill
revisit
this
one
later
in
the
summer
d
quite
drinkablethe
flavors
meld
well
together
and
its
fairly
crisp
and
refreshing
a
drinkable
beer
good
for
a
hot
day
that
dryness
would
really
be
helpful
with
some
spicy
food
and
the
hint
of
sweetness
kept
me
coming
back
for
more
a
good
solid
pilsner
smooth
and
creamy
with
a
nice
buzz
of
carbonation
clean
crisp
and
satisfying
beer

with
a
decent
half

started
with
a
beery
home
brew
quality
but
then
turned
into
a
solidly
balanced
malthop
flavor
pleasantly
bitter
aftertaste
appropriate
to
the
style
once
a
got
used
to
the
flavor
profile
three
of
these
went
down
exceptionally
well
overall
a
great
try
on
a
difficult
style
to
master
md
a
bit
more
robust
in
the
mouth
than
i
would
have
expected
but
not
really
heavy
by
any
means
the
carbonation
is
perfect
lending
itself
to
a
smooth
creaminess
that
makes
this
brew
so
easy
to
drink
this
is
incredibly
satisfying
and
tasty
and
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
looking
for
a
good
pilsner
this
will
be
a
new
regular
in
my
rounds
overall
this
is
a
great
summer
brew

this
is
among
one
of
the
best
pilseners
i
have
had
to

id
like
to
do
a

comparing
the

which
i
feel
is
another
great

i
wished
i
lived
closer
so
i
could
drink
these
guys
stuff
every
night
so
amazing
this
is
one
of
my
lesser
enjoyed
brooklyns
but
i
still
like
it
the
aroma
is
sorta
grainy
and
fruity
nice
fluffy
head
this
is
a
really
solid
pilsner
its
not
very
often
that
floral
hops
hit
in
you
in
the
face
so
enjoyably
with
a
pilsner
its
usually
that
gross

though
it
fades
quickly
when
i
first
took
a
sip
of
this
beer
i
thought
it
lacked
flavor
but
as
i
got
accustomed
to
it
i
kept
noticing
little
subtleties
with
each
taste
plenty
of
mellow
matly
scents
and
tastes
but
comes
nowhere
near
the
memory
of
that
one

probably
one
of
the
best

had

the
taste
is

the

is

good
pilsner
here
but
never
are
the
malts
pushed
the
background
we
got
two
of
these
in
cans
and
a
cuban
cigar
for
three
bucks
just
off
the
boardwalk
on
the
dutch
side
on
the
french
side
they
were
more
like
4
each
in
a
fancy
restaurant
on
orient
beach
good
value
in
the
can
and
i
think
it
was
tastier
and
the
cigar
wasnt
at
all
bad
either
a

a

lemonmineral
water
taste
nicely
rounded
with

hops
and
an
apparently
endless
amount
of

bubbles
make
for
an
enjoyable
pilsener
got
this
pint
can
for
1

very
refreshing
and
sessionable
nice
maltier
pils
good
full
flavor
must
be
the
mineral
water
its
surprisingly
pleasant
for
a
pilsener
enjoy
this
was
a
crisp
beer
with
a
subtle
hard
to
identify
aftertaste
it
wasnt
anything
special
but
i
enjoyed
it
i
am
neutral
on
this
beer
the
beer
pours
pale
golden
with
a
cottonlike
cap
of
foam
the
liquid
is
pale
golden
with
air
of
breadiness
very
light
on
the
palatedefinitely
has
a
macro
sense
about
it
with
some
cooked
veggies
through
the
center
and
could
use
a
little
more
bitterness
at
the
finish
all
in
all
though
its
drinkable
nice
refreshing
brew
not
too
claggy
on
the
pallet
taste
doesnt
linger
at
the
back
of
my
throat
after
two
500ml
bottles
whereas
other
beers
do
forcing
me
to
reach
for
a
cider
onto
my
third
still
finding
it
refreshing
good
price
95p
per
bottle
might
be
on
these
for
a
while
till
i
get
bored
overall
a
good
if
not
unusual
beer
there
is
not
a
single
dutch
lager
that
comes
even
close
to
this
golden
simplicity
if
you
can
find
it
i
recommend
it
it
looks
fancy
and
isnt
too
expensive
and
its
5
so
its
no
lite
beer
picked
up
a
case
of
these
in
8
oz
cans
not
having
tried
hope
not
to
be
disappointed
lets
give
it
a
whirl
popping
the
can
top
i
dont
get
much
of
a
smell
reading
the
label
it
is
made
with
barely
malt
and
wheat
so
doesnt
look
adjunct
pouring
into
my
handy
sapp
i
get
a
bright
yellow
brew
with
a
big
bright
white
foamy
head
that
tops
out
the
remaining
space
in
the
sapp
on
the
taste
this
brew
is
bitter
sweet
hopping
with
a
nice
maltiness
in
the
background
well
in
line
with
what
is
expected
from
a
typical
dutch
brew
very
thirst
quenching
and
tasty
and
will
serve
its
purpose
well
for
what
it
is
intended
a
lawn
mower
brew
actually
a
quite
good
lawn
mower
brew
a
fair
pilsner
thats
a
tad
unbalanced
with
the
flavors
the
hop
bitterness
doesnt
quite
mesh
well
with
the
malts
coming
across
a
bit
too
strong
and
leaving
a
faint
metallic
aftertaste
the
high
point
is
the
appearance
with
excellent
head
retention
and
plenty
of
foam
rings
down
the
glass
certainly
drinkable
yet
just
as
easily
forgettable
a
decent
and
refreshing
pilsener
better
than
most
of
its
european
mass
produced
counterparts
o
this
isnt
a
bad
german
pilsener
from
a
dutch
macro
brewery
especially
since
there
are
no
aromas
or
favors
of
adjunct
malts
the
body
is
light
and
it
has
a
very
watery
and
thin
feeling
i
couldve
sworn
bavaria
was
in
germany
anyway
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
fingerandahalf
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
grass
flowers
light
wild
rice
and
a
touch
of
wheat
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
grass
in
control
but
not
in
an
unpleasant
way
the
body
is
a
hefty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
nice
little
pils
nothing
incredible
a
fairly
tasty
choice
especially
for
the
price
flavor
of
light
lemony
hops
and
neutral
graininess
smooth
and
drinkable
with
a
creamy
feel
given
the
carbonation
level
and
light
sweetness
combination
does
finish
a
bit
dry
and
chalky
in
contrast
easy
yet
unexciting
o
this
isnt
a
special
beer
in
any
way
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
one
of
the
better
europilsners
around
and
at
least
its
not
brewed
under
licence
in
the
uk
i
never
buy
anything
brewed
under
licence
not
too
sweet
nor
too
bitter
value
at
1
50
for
a
660ml
bottle
99p
if
you
shop
about
a
good
session
beer
and
great
with
bbq
overall
a
refreshing
enough
german
pilsner
a
bit
on
the
sweet
side
to
drink
a
lot
of
though
overall
impression
an
easy
going
brew
that
ive
always
seen
but
never
orderedbought
a
store
easy
going
and
good
overall
for
a
german
pilsner
this
brew
gets
all
kinds
of
promotion
in
bosnia
especially
during
the
film
festival
it
pours
a
budlight
looking
watered
down
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
doesnt
last
it
smells
like
german
malts
crystal
mostly
no
hops
to
speak
of
flavor
is
the
standard
german
pils
cheaply
made
it
doesnt
have
much
of
that
dusty
grainy
character
and
is
more
in
line
with
the
adjunct
lagers
in
my
opinion
still
with
decent
carbonation
and
a
very
light
body
its
an
easy
drinking
beer
a
lot
of
the
beers
here
are
starting
to
taste
the
same
to
me
watery
malt
half
liters
without
much
sex
appeal
this
is
another
one
of
those
the
beer
is
pale
yellow
in
color
just
like
straw
nice
white
head
that
however
disappear
quite
fast
the
aroma
is
very
faint
some
cereal
grain
some
wheat
nothing
extraordinary
the
taste
is
quite
ordinary
malty
low
intensity
in
the
taste
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
to
drink
very
cold
like
heineken
not
bad
but
not
great
too
average
beer
overall
a
pretty
basic
tasting
lager
with
a
good
drinkability
great
lawn
mowing
beer
just
another
average
pilsener
good
thing
that
is
so
cheap
you
can
buy
36
bottles
for
999
overall
the
strongest
component
of
this
brew
was
the
taste
judging
by
the
nose
we
were
expecting
something
much
more
bittering
but
we
got
something
crisp
and
relatively
well
balanced
the
flavoring
was
within
the
style
but
the
nose
took
us
for
a
loop
with
a
hazy
floury
bomb
it
just
didnt
smell
fresh
despite
the
dating
and
proper
storage
in
the
end
all
of
the
components
could
have
been
better
integrated
amongst
each
other
which
would
have
made
for
a
more
enjoyable
brew
this
is
a
decent
easy
drinking
pilsner
its
not
offensive
but
its
not
overly
flavorful
theres
just
enough
flavor
to
keep
me
interested
ill
probably
have
this
again
another
average
lager
go
down
easy
not
too
bad
bah
a
fairly
typical
massproduced
lager
dull
and
characterless
weak
aroma
and
flavour
with
some
offnotes
not
particularly
good
the
low
price
is
the
only
thing
going
for
it
give
it
a
miss
insubstantial
watery
mouthfeel
overly
slick
for
some
strange
reason
overall
this
is
quite
a
bad
pilsner
i
wouldnt
recommend
this
beer
to
anyone
skunk
or
no
skunk
isnt
a
bad
beer
at
all
but
it
isnt
phenomenal
overall
this
is
actually
pretty
good
value
in
my
opinion
i
might
get
it
again
if
im
looking
for
a
wellpriced
beer
that
isnt
too
bad
either
drinkable
is
the
best
praise
i
can
muster
and
this
is
definitely
a
poor
representative
of
the
style
it
has
been
placed
in
consider
this
a
c
if
taken
for
what
it
actually
is
an
epl
comparable
to
becks
or
heiny
but
much
cheaper
and
really
the
price
is
basically
all
this
beer
has
going
for
it
so
if
you
drink
epls
regularly
you
could
probably
switch
over
to
this
and
save
money
without
noticing
much
of
a
difference
drink
with
something
salty
to
munch
on
hand
overall
this
has
some
features
of
a
generic
pilsner
but
it
seems
to
work
and
not
bad
if
youre
looking
for
cheap
beer
worth
a
try
and
in
my
opinion
better
then
heineken
the
flavor
is
alot
liek
say
a
moosehead
better
than
an
aal
but
still
shit
german
pilsener
my
ass
i
cant

the
score
the
bros
gave

overall
pass
it
up
couldnt
even
down
half
of
this
one
oi
expected
some
better
tasteit
has
some
unusual
aromawhich
i
didnt
like
o
a
decent
pilsener
flavour
and
budget
price
combine
for
good
drinkability
a
much
loved
beer
in
my
student
days
not
bad
refreshing
and
dry
abv
5
poured
this
pilsner
from
a
12
oz
bottle
the
pilsener
poured
a
straw
color
and
it
had
very
nice
clarity
there
was
a
nice
fluffy
head
with
above
average
retention
and
it
produced
nice
lacing
the
aroma
of
the
beer
is
comprised
of
sweet
honey
and
lemon
the
taste
of
the
german
pilsner
was
sweet
it
had
medium
body
overall
the
beer
was
very
grassy
herbal
there
was
very
little
if
any
malt
flavor
the
beer
is
nice
and
smooth
easy
to
drink
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
but
fastly
disappearing
head
scent
is
rather
mild
with
wheat
and
bitter
malts
the
taste
is
rather
weak
for
a
german
pilsner
slightly
grainy
with
hints
of
citrus
rather
thin
texture
that
feels
about
the
same
as
water
its
the
kind
of
taste
you
expect
when
they
bottle
it
in
a
green
bottle
but
i
will
say
this
is
better
than
heineken
as
it
warmed
it
eventually
opened
up
into
a
slightly
watery
version
of
heineken
with
the
same
light
and
sweet
bready
malt
with
a
crisp
edge
to
it
not
bad
but
not
much
of
a
pilsner
either
consider
this
a
pale
lager
with
a
little
more
hops
and
some
better
malts
this
could
be
an
ok
pilsner
not
bad
at
all
bavaria
is
trying
to
be
a
poor
mans
heineken
imo
its
from
holland
comes
in
a
green
bottle
and
has
similar
label
graphics
but
its
priced
quite
a
bit
below
heineken
and
comes
in
those
pesky
european
11
2
oz330
ml
bottles
which
works
out
to
about
1
12
12oz
bottles
fewer
per
case
anyway
onto
the
beer
itself
im
not
a
heineken
fan
the
taste
is
somewhat
similar
but
the
mouthfeel
is
much
thinner
a
lot
less
body
than
heineken
and
relatedly
much
fizzier
and
with
a
shorterlasting
flavor
overall
not
terrible
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
o
a
beer
that
quenches
the
thirst
but
besides
that
not
very
interesting
yup
this
is
actually
not
bad
its
very
crisp
and
refreshing
its
almost
as
if
i
put
a
slice
of
lemon
in
this
thing
it
has
a
great
aftertaste
lots
of
hops
there
overall
its
a
wellrounded
beer
that
is
probably
overlooked
more
than
it
should
be
not
too
shabby
overall
i
was
on
the
fence
with
this
one
it
had
a
taste
that
seemed
a
little
off
to
me
maybe
even
a
little
harsh
anyways
it
was
still
worth
a
try
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
good
thing
i
have
some
belgians
ive
never
seen
before
on
deck
d
completely
refreshing
this
is
a
beer
that
imo
should
only
be
quaffed
for
quaff
sake
get
your
lawnchair
out
and
put
on
the
oranje
game
cause
your
gonna
get
drunk
and
go
back
for
more
with
this
one
german
pilsener
fans
would
do
well
to
outright
ignore
this
beers
existence
and
move
right
along
usc
fratboys
rejoice
this
isnt
as
much

it
might
seem

attend

food
match

hot
dogs

other

if
youre
buying
a

this
i
wouldnt

on
a

drinkability
very
drinkable
in
single
or
doubles
on
a
really
hot
day
they
are
too
rich
to
quaff
in
quantity
d
i
think
this
beer
is
meant
to
be
a
ripoff
of
heineken
if
so
it
fails
somewhat
in
terms
of
the
bottled
stuff
only
it
actually
tastes
fairly
similar
to
heineken
from
the
minikegs
overall
its
cheap
and
ok
to
drink
but
hardly
exciting

for

that
was

upon
popping

carried
through

so
not

it
seems
to
lag

in

crisp

quite
refreshing
and
well
made
although
nothing
stood
out
as
exceptional
it
was
solid
all
around
i
digress
bottom
line
was
that
this
had
a
good
nose
for
the
style
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
an
initial
sweetness
followed
by
a
hop
snap
on
the
tongue
finish
had
the
same
initial
sweetness
followed
by
a
hoppy
bitterness
on
the
extreme
finish
it
is
something
like
this
that
makes
the
madness
worthwhile
i
would
bet
that
the
hops
may
not
hold
up
as
well
in
a
bottle
although
i
do
not
speak
from
experience
i
do
know
that
some
of
the
most
worthwhile
imports
that
i
have
drunk
in
the
last
few
years
have
been
lager
beers
in
a
can
definitely
coolerworthy
t
little
bitter
in
taste
with
a
final
very
thin
slightly
bitter
body
very
light
refreshing
quenching
in
times
of
heat
not
a
great
beer
but
certainly
drinkable
d
as
said
above
while
heavily
carbonated
and
it
does
not
taste
of
any
adjuncts
nor
is
there
much
skunkiness
a
good
dependable
stock
beer
that
can
be
drunk
at
almost
any
time
of
the
day
agreeable
but
uninspiring
i
can
see
why
theyve
resorted
to
media
stunts
involving
hot
blonds
because
the
beer
just
isnt
very
exciting
i
might
drink
this
again
the
price
is
right
perhaps
on
a
hot
day
when
i
feel
like
downing
a
6
pack
of
tall
boys
i
tried
this
beer
on
june
29
2009
after
purchasing
fropm
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
pale
gold
colour
with
a
foamy
bubbly
white
head
and
a
ton
of
effervescent
the
aroma
was
grassy
malt
some
off
aromas
and
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
highly
carbonated
and
lightbodied
the
flavour
was
grainy
malt
with
a
bitter
finish
and
some
peppery
notes
good
smooth
beer
with
no
off
flavors
its
not
the
best
beer
in
the
world
but
ok
for
4
a
sixpack
what
can
i
say
for
the
rest
it
is
a
very
smooth
beer
with
no
negative
things
to
say
about
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
drinkability
this
beer
was
actually
better
than
i
expected
though
not
great
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
this
but
if
i
could
find
it
again
for
the
price
i
bought
it
for
only
1can
at
my
local
kroger
id
buy
it
without
question
worth
a
shot
appears
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
falls
to
a
tiny
ring
almost
instantly
smells
malty
with
slightly
bitter
hops
some
caramel
the
taste
is
a
lot
of
rich
malt
some
dry
bitterness
a
bit
of
marzipan
body
is
lightmedium
small
bubbles
light
to
medium
carbonation
level
fairly
smooth
overall
easy
enough
to
drink
but
would
likely
not
go
out
of
my
way
to
purchase
again
hmmmm
i
see
that
other
reviewers
have
mentioned
adjunct
this
version
of
bavaria
i
tasted
is
brewed
in
south
africa
using
only
malted
barley
hops
and
water
taste
is
pretty
crisp
with
the
grainy
malts
dominating
the
flavor
profile
there
is
some
hop
balancing
in
there
but
mostly
on
the
finish
a
bit
of
a
musty
flavor
comes
through
and
a
slight
metallic
bite
it
is
a
step
up
from
heineken
as
far
as
holland
beers
are
concerned
but
not
as
good
as
most
german
pilsners
from
deutschland
mouthfeel
is
a
little
on
the
thin
side
not
too
bad
but
pretty
forgettable
beer
there
are
many
better
options
from
germany
i
would
look
to
before
this
one
decent
pils
not
world
class
but
certainly
affordaable
here
14
for
6
500ml
cans
d
this
is
probably
one
of
the
best
lagers
ive
had
mainly
because
of
its
unique
aroma
and
flavor
profile
its
a
beer
that
i
could
drink
all
night
alcohol
is
well
hidden
as
well
it
must
be
the
pure
mineral
water
that
is
used
in
the
brewing
process
that
makes
this
different
i
highly
recommend
d
this
is
a
pleasant
brew
but
certainly
nothing
ground
breaking
here
i
certainly
would
not
be
opposed
to
drinking
one
and
i
would
probably
purchase
it
again
if
i
saw
it
on
sale
and
was
in
the
mood
for
a
pilsener
obviously
the
germans
do
it
best
but
i
found
it
quite
refreshing
d
goes
down
easy
but
overall
this
is
a
pretty
bland
yet
inoffensive
beer
well
a
bit
of
an
improvement
from
the
bottled
version
skunkorama
but
this
is
still
a
bit
rough
for
what
i
expect
from
an
euro
pils
itll
do
in
a
pinch
and
its
more
crisp
than
commercial
domestics
but
i
dont
have
a
hankering
to
consume
this
on
a
regular
basis
drinkability
a
little
less
than
pleasant
unfortunately
while
it
may
be
better
on
draught
away
from
these
ghastly
green
bottles
as
it
stands
i
think
you
could
find
far
better
pilsners
out
there
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
like
so
many
other
people
served
in
a
glass
almost
no
head
color
is
goldlike
i
smell
malt
and
it
also
tastes
like
it
and
a
bit
of
hops
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
it
goes
down
well
really
light
perfect
for
this
hot
weather
id
try
it
again
good
mouthfeel
very
drinkable
obviously
this
isnt
something
id
rush
out
to
get
again
but
im
not
going
to
turn
my
nose
up
at
the
overall
product
d
taste
like
heineken
and
grolsch
but
much
better
very
good
pilsener
i
liked
a
lot
with
fish
overall
a
good
beer
to
buy
if
knocking
back
a
few
at
a
party
overall
in
the
same
league
as
grolsch
and
hertog
jan
pilsners
for
me
great
for
the
style
i
like
this
one
especially
the
qualityprize
ratio
is
excellent
20
cheaper
compared
to
other
pilsners
nice
football
beer
d
a
good
pilsener
that
ill
never
turn
down
allthough
there
are
better
ones
around
md
the
carbonation
is
impressive
and
the
body
is
light
high
quality
drinking
here
dthis
stuff
really
hit
the
spot
while
doing
some
installation
work
at
home
the
other
day
it
was
quenching
sessionable
light
on
the
palate
and
low
enough
in
alcohol
where
i
didnt
need
to
worry
about
using
power
tools
after
one
its
slightly
better
than
your
average
macro
and
is
not
bad
it
its
cold
and
fresh
although
i
think
the
bestby
date
is
pushing
the
envelope
a
little
122010
this
is
decent
but
nothing
that
id
seek
out
again
someone
gave
me
a
few
bottles
and
if
i
found
a
few
in
my
fridge
again
id
certainly
toss
them
back
i
bought
because
it
was
on
huge
discount
and
remembered
seeing
some
advertisements
but
i
doubt
i
would
ever
buy
it
again
pours
clear
golden
with
white
head
smell
is
slightly
skunky
and
a
bit
sweet
taste
is
a
bit
cereal
like
in
its
sweetness
with
a
funky
bitterness
to
follow
crisp
and
bubbly
watery
mouthfeel
but
the
malt
flavor
of
this
tastes
a
bit
cheap
not
my
favorite
of
pale
lagers
but
drinkable
wouldnt
seek
this
one
out
again
drinkability
a
great
choice
with
limited
selection
not
the
best
pilsner
but
definitly
solid
d
i
llove
these
i
can
drink
alot
of
them
d
ok
but
nothing
special
lightness
makes
it
go
down
easy
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
if
it
were
offered
to
me
but
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
wouldnt
necessarily
seek
this
out
but
as
a
cheap
alternative
would
drink
as
a
midpriced
german
pilsner
failed
again
in
my
quest
for
a
supermarket
label
that
id
actually
want
to
drink
pale
yellow
urine
like
colour
with
a
head
that
subsides
quickly
leaving
a
film
that
looks
like
someone
spat
into
the
glass
i
couldnt
find
a
nose
inspite
of
my
best
efforts
taste
was
not
vile
like
that
of
many
of
its
adjunct
cousins
and
that
is
about
the
only
saving
grace
the
color
was
light
golden
yellow
smell
light
hoppy
and
pilsey
taste
was
of
a
light
wheat
and
hoppy
10
times
better
than
the
average
american
pils
and
lagers
its
mouthfeel
was
very
smooth
and
lightbodied
taste
i
think
this
needs
a
bigger
bitter
finish
if
it
had
more
hop
bitterness
than
the
drinkability
would
have
scored
a
little
higher
from
me
its
ok
but
it
failed
to
wow
bavaria
beer
comes
in
an
eight
ounce
green
bottle
and
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
thin
white
head
there
is
a
mildly
skunky
aroma
in
the
heineken
vein
the
flavor
however
is
more
assertively
skunky
and
there
is
a
bit
adjunct
noticeable
not
much
to
recommend
this
one
id
pass
drinkability
is
easy
but
really
why
would
you
want
to
theres
nothing
to
see
here
folks
move
along
got
this
in
a
beer
variety
pack
from
world
market
there
was
nothing
at
all
special
about
this
beer
no
different
than
any
of
the
american
macro
lagers
in
my
opinion
not
bad
not
good
not
one
that
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
again
to
get
but
would
drink
it
if
it
was
the
only
available
pours
a
light
golden
color
body
with
a
medium
sized
head
big
bubbles
but
fairly
quickly
diminishing
has
an
aroma
of
malts
taste
of
malts
and
is
acidic
slightly
bitter
light
tasting
not
much
flavor
blah
weak
lager
lacking
adequate
malt
content
grassy
aroma
slightly
appealing
average
pale
gold
pour
medium
white
head
moderate
lacing
light
shallow
mouthfeel
finishes
with
a
weird
emptiness
flavor
is
virtually
nonexistent
really
lacking
in
the
malt
department
i
could
however
detect
some
mild
hop
bitterness
overall
a
guzzler
perhaps
may
be
refreshing
after
a
long
hot
day
but
rather
weak
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
pale
lager
d
yet
another
boring
massproduced
greenbottled
beer
not
offensively
bad
but
simply
undistinguished
a
decent
if
not
insipid
dutch
lager
light
in
appearance
color
head
aroma
and
taste
this
makes
it
crisp
and
refreshing
in
a
nobrainer
type
of
beer
way
light
like
some
american
lagers
without
the
off
corn
or
rice
flavors
of
beers
made
with
adjuncts
bought
a
12
pack
on

at
bevmo
for

99
good
for
the
price
if
nothing
else
wouldnt
pay

a
twelver
bavaria
holland
doesnt
offer
much
even
as
far
as
euro
pale
lagers
go
fans
of
the
style
might
find
it
tolerable
but
i
just
cant
see
anyone
making
a
convincing
case
for
this
beer
its
not
something
i
personally
would
ever
care
to
go
back
to
anyhow
especially
if
i
felt
like
having
a
refreshing
beer
all
in
all
the
mouthfeel
was
light
to
medium
a
little
creamy
taste
was
not
too
sweet
or
bittery
straight
down
the
middle
but
expect
some
doughy
grainy
yeasty
flavours
i
could
see
me
grabbing
these
when
on
special
for
a
hot
aussie
day
with
the
fellas
enjoy
a
session
not
bad
it
reminds
me
of
a
watered
down
heineken
probably
wont
buy
again
mouthfeel
is
very
light
and
crisp
fairly
refreshing
though
not
the
most
interesting
d
drinkable
but
just
not
special
enough
to
bring
me
back
d
this
is
an
okay
pilsener
at
2
for
22oz
it
was
a
good
value
beer
serving
type
bottle
md
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
excellent
carbonation
easytodrink
could
be
confused
with
a
standard
epl
but
not
a
bad
one
at
that
d
a
subpar
pilsener
in
my
opinion
easy
to
drink
but
doesnt
deliver
the
flavours
like
a
good
pils
should
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
definitely
wont
be
rushing
back
to
it
this
was
just
one
of
those
beers
at
total
wine
that
fell
in
the
miscellaneous
group
had
this
one
chilled
in
a
pub
glass
poured
a
rich
bright
golden
with
a
good
white
head
smelled
of
musty
skunkiness
very
unique
actually
tasted
crisp
with
hop
bitterness
and
some
cooked
corn
light
and
bubbley
on
the
palate
drinkability
refreshing
but
i
could
use
cheaper
beer
for
that
purchased
as
part
of
buildyourownsixpack
at
local
grocer
poured
a
basic
lager
yellow
with
a
small
head
a
distinct
skunkiness
to
the
nose
and
following
the
initial
mild
bitterness
that
skunkiness
popped
back
up
in
the
taste
failry
smooth
with
medium
carbonation
nothing
special
that
skunkiness
is
irritating
though
d
i
believe
a
keg
of
this
might
be
enough
not
a
terrible
brew
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
again
perhaps
a
notch
above
other
american
macros
mediocre
d
not
a
bad
pils
a
nice
hop
bite
balanced
by
a
slight
malt
sweetness
but
a
bit
watery
making
it
a
bit
thin
and
weak
average
this
is
a
good
beer
way
better
than
i
was
expecting
aftertaste
is
short
light
bitter
and
dry
pours
a
clear
gold
with
fluffy
white
head
which
fades
quickly
clinging
lacing
however
smell
sweet

floral

mouthfeel
light
to
medium

its
a

even
for
a
pils
but
a
decent
easy

beer
good
beer
woukld
be
nice
to
session
12oz
green
bottle
with
no
freshness
date
pours
a
medium
gold
with
a
pur
white
2
finger
head
good
longevity
and
good
lace
nice
sweet
honey
malt
smells
with
slight
citrus
decent
malt
flavors
mixed
with
honey
and
lemon
not
a
huge
typical
pilsner
hop
flavor
or
bitterness
which
make
it
different
enough
and
in
this
case
different
is
a
good
thing
a
bit
heavy
to
be
super
refreshing
but
good
in
the
winter
when
tired
of
the
heavier
beers
a
nice
beer
summary
for
the
price
i
believe
that
this
is
a
better
beer
for
the
buck
than
most
others
of
the
same
style
could
have
done
without
the
green
bottle
though
watery
and
bubbly
crisp
texture
if
you
like
heinekin
youll
like
this
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
a
little
on
the
thin
side
a
pretty
average
euro
lager
will
avoid
d
easy
to
drink
you
can
drink
a
bottle
in
notime
overall
this
was
a
pretty
affordable
beer
and
not
bad
for
the
price
that
i
paid
little
over
6
bucks
a
six
pack
this
beer
felt
like
a
pretty
watered
down
version
of
peroni
or
even
stella
artois
besides
that
it
was
a
beer
i
could
see
myself
buying
down
the
road
for
the
price
this
is
a
decent
beer
picked
up
a
12
at
a
latin
grocery
store
in
miami
out
of
pure
curiosity
pours
pale
gold
with
a
small
head
with
no
lace
smells
bitter
and
hopy
just
as
it
tastes
decent
carbonation
and
the
mouthfeel
is
very
light
bitter
and
clean
the
only
reason
someone
should
drink
more
than
3
of
these
if
for
the
price
not
really
the
taste
but
worth
a
try
its
a
fine
thirst
quencher
and
likely
works
well
with
mild
tilapia
or
simple
pasta
but
as
a
stand
alone
beer
its
largely
forgettable
a
light
goldenbrown
brew
with
a
big
head
at
first
but
little
left
after
a
few
minutes
solid
lacing
however
smell
is
very
weak
a
slight
hoppywheat
thing
not
bad
but
not
very
discernable
a
hint
of
metal
no
doubt
associated
with
its
cute
little
250ml
can
that
a
friend
brought
back
from
aruba
for
me
the
flavor
is
mild
cereal
stuff
but
not
too
bad
i
note
some
alcohol
although
this
is
just
5
abv
fair
carbonation
for
a
refreshing
drink
a
pepperytangy
touch
on
the
tongue
sort
of
grows
on
you
but
with
only
250ml
to
work
with
i
will
just
say
this
is
ok
enough
wouldnt
turn
it
down
worth
a
try
on
a
hot
day
but
not
to
write
home
about
from
a
can
this
yellow
brew
is
unimpressive
at
best
it
has
a
small
head
and
a
very
light
clear
appearance
the
aroma
is
grassy
with
a
very
slight
herbal
hop
smell
not
much
in
the
way
of
malt
or
grain
in
the
smell
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
with
a
serious
metallic
quality
no
real
flavor
and
nearly
no
bitterness
its
quite
carbonated
and
with
the
thinness
it
gives
a
bit
of
a
sodawater
impression
the
finish
is
pretty
empty
i
really
didnt
get
anything
out
of
this
brew
not
really
satisfying
even
as
a
lawnmower
beer
nice
nonaggressive
mouthfeel
but
overall
this
is
a
very
skunkfocused
beer
d
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
a
notch
better
than
your
typical
eurolager
lots
of
the
ol
euro
skunk
yeast
on
first
sniff
it
subsides
after
a
few
minutes
hey
the
taste
is
not
bad
at
all
malty
and
mellow
but
with
a
sharp
hop
bite
to
finish
i
only
had
one
for
a
sample
but
ive
seen
these
around
in
12
packs
for
under
9

not
a
bad
deal
for
a
lawnmover
or
session
sucking
beer
better
tasting
and
cheaper
than
heinecrap
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
a
lot
of
chunky
white
head
that
laces
the
glass
not
bad
i
could
smell
the
skunk
when
i
opened
the
bottle
at
waist
height
theres
also
some
malty
and
yeasty
smells
there
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
but
damn
the
skunk
the
taste
is
very
smooth
and
clean
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hop
flavorbitterness
on
the
back
end
mouthfeel
is
a
fairly
creamy
overall
its
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
just
wish
they
hadnt
put
it
in
a
green
bottle
not
overall
inpressed
with
this
one
would
be
a
good
sesion
beer
for
the
price
you
probably
could
do
better
poured
a
light
pale
golden
color
with
a
big
white
head
and
a
nice
streaming
carbonation
from
the
bottom
smell
was
very
yeasty
with
the
classic
lager
smell
hints
of
a
slight
hoppiness
could
be
detected
first
impression
of
the
taste
was
light
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
flavors
are
atypical
of
the
style
and
nothing
exceptional
overall
though
it
is
a
fantastic
little
sessionable
lager
i
actually
prefer
to
heineken
try
this
one
you
wont
be
pissed
at
me
overall
i
would
say
that
bavaria
is
about
your
average
euro
pale
lager
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
but
the
aftertaste
will
make
you
pretty
thirsty
i
would
suggest
it
to
anyone
who
is
looking
for
an
alternative
from
the
more
trendy
green
bottle
beers
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
medium
bone
white
head
without
much
retention
thin
rings
of
lacing
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
grainy
malt
with
a
bit
of
hops
lightbodied
and
clean
mouthfeel
with
mild
malt
and
hops
flavors
the
finish
is
sweet
malt
and
fruit
with
a
touch
of
hops
on
the
back
end
overall
this
beer
is
a
straightforward
pilslager
that
is
instantly
forgotten
this
is
a
good
everyday
beer
with
its
value
poured
with
a
huge
frothy
foamy
textured
offwhite
head
and
plenty
of
lace
head
mostly
dissipated
shortly
yellow
gold
color
fresh
beery
lightly
hoppy
and
malty
nose
flavors
about
the
same
but
more
emphasis
on
the
hops
bodys
a
bit
thin
at
first
when
its
colder
easy
drinking
a
session
beer
could
easily
have
scored
this
a
lot
lower
not
a
beer
i
would
choose
again
d
overall
inoffensive
not
terribly
exciting
though
md
the
texture
is
alright
not
too
fizzy
and
not
too
thin
almost
clean
if
not
for
the
finishing
sugary
touch
nevertheless
the
overall
flavour
fails
to
make
an
impression
of
a
quality
pilsnerstyle
lager
if
that
is
the
style
this
beer
purports
to
be
overall
good
drinkability
but
nothing
to
get
too
excited
over
clear
golden
straw
in
color
with
active
carbonation
and
a
small
bit
of
sediment
topped
off
with
a
fingers
worth
of
tight
white
bubbles
the
head
falls
away
quickly
to
an
inconsequential
ring
besides
the
lagery
grain
base
that
one
expects
there
was
an
appetizing
hint
of
honey
in
the
nose
unfortunately
this
was
offset
by
a
bit
of
dusty
skunkiness
the
taste
was
better
than
i
expected
though
unremarkable
grainy
and
somewhat
sweet
with
the
bubbles
adding
some
crispness
its
all
fleeting
though
as
nothing
about
this
beer
sticks
around
as
pilseners
go
this
one
is
drinkable
but
uninspiring
i
really
hate
wasting
beer
with
so
many
uneducated
beer
drinkers
out
there
but
this
isnt
beer
its
fizzy
skunk
juice
watery
mouthfeel
but
good
drinkability
quite
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
or
as
a
session
beer
but
nothing
earthshattering
compares
well
to
other
european
lagers
at
a
better
price
point
very
true
to
style
it
poured
a
handsome
golden
color
with
decent
head
formation
which
left
no
lacing
it
smelled
good
not
in
a
big
beer
sense
but
it
was
light
and
refreshing
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
not
all
that
great
though
it
was
thicker
than
i
felt
it
should
be
and
not
really
refreshing
at
all
taste
was
not
offputting
but
seemed
syrupy
almost
which
was
not
was
i
expecting
a
light
and
refreshing
lager
drinkability
is
bad
i
would
go
after
a
bud
light
over
this
any
day
if
you
see
this
beer
run
dont
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
nearest
ipa
and
forget
you
ever
saw
it
i
drank
this
pilsner
stright
out
of
the
bottle
it
has
a
little
heineken
tyoe
smell
but
not
much
it
tastes
good
for
the
price
i
paid
8
99
for
twelve
bottles
it
is
smooth
tastes
like
a
macro
but
with
more
flavor
and
the
flavor
is
good
definitely
high
drinkability
i
recommend
this
beer
as
a
break
from
the
heavier
beers
okay
lets
talk
about
the
beer
bavaria
is
brewed
in
lieshout
holland
by
the
bavaria
brewery
note
they
also
produce
hollandia
which
is
very
similar
to
bavaria
if
not
identical
bavaria
is
a
typical
dutch
lager
being
both
medium
gold
and
moderately
hopped
it
pours
brilliantly
clear
and
foamy
with
a
somewhat
shortlived
head
the
aroma
is
clean
malt
with
very
subtle
noble
hop
and
yeast
notes
the
body
is
on
the
light
side
but
appropriate
for
the
style
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
clean
with
moderate
malt
flavor
and
a
short
mellow
hop
bite
i
also
detected
some
oxidation
in
the
finish
despite
the
fact
that
this
beer
is
only
34
months
old
this
is
not
surprising
since
light
lagers
dont
tent
to
travel
well
and
this
beer
probably
spent
most
of
that
time
in
a
hot
warehouse
in
the
middle
of
the
texas
summer
overall
i
think
this
beer
compares
very
favorably
to
other
dutch
lagers
while
it
is
not
as
assertive
as
alfa
edelpils
or
dommelsch
it
is
at
least
as
tasty
as
grolsch
or
the
bigh
ill
give
this
one
a
4
based
on
being
true
to
style
very
drinkable
and
an
outstanding
value
bavaria
is
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
throwdown
beers
available
i
was
expecting
a
heinekentype
of
dutch
import
but
it
was
actually
somewhat
better
than
that
poured
the
expected
light
golden
color
with
white
head
but
unlike
others
of
its
type
the
head
lingered
for
the
entire
glass
and
left
very
good
lacing
has
the
typical
grainy
lager
aroma
but
the
taste
is
flavorful
and
the
finish
is
smooth
this
actually
was
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
bavaria
was
golden
in
color
with
a
thick
white
head
the
head
had
good
retention
and
left
some
lacing
behind
the
aroma
was
light
malt
with
a
little
hops
in
the
background
the
taste
was
fairly
light
and
about
the
same
as
the
aroma
with
a
dry
finish
the
body
was
fairly
light
with
plenty
of
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
its
not
as
hoppy
as
i
like
but
is
still
a
decent
pilsener
not
much
to
smell
or
look
at
this
beer
had
a
pronounced
bitterness
with
little
redeeming
malt
i
was
ok
with
it
bit
could
not
finish
a
500
ml
can
and
it
was
not
popular
with
my
dinner
mates
while
not
metallic
the
taste
was
a
bit
harsh
and
thin
theres
been
better
honestly
it
might
be
a
little
skunked
beware
the
green
bottle
a
deep
golden
color
with
visible
signs
of
carbonation
a
small
head
forms
but
dissolves
away
quickly
leaving
a
visible
film
on
top
the
scent
of
malt
is
very
evident
with
some
fruity
aromas
at
the
end
the
taste
is
very
malty
but
surprisingly
there
is
no
bitterness
there
at
all
maybe
a
slight
twang
of
hops
at
the
end
but
is
not
very
consistant
in
the
flavor
it
is
light
in
the
mouth
not
much
of
a
feel
of
the
carbonation
very
surprising
flavor
for
a
lager
i
was
expecting
a
little
more
in
hops
from
this
beer
still
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
a
decent
euro
all
malt
golden
lager
clean
malty
tastem
subdued
lemmony
hopping
soft
mouth
feel
no
surprizes
or
over
complexity
very
drinkable
ill
buy
more
if
there
is
no
jr
brickman
around
strong
honeyish
malt
flavour
a
bit
cloying
in
texture
i
feel
thirsty
after
swallowing
some
bland
seedy
back
palate
without
any
notable
hop
flavour
to
balance
the
malt
touch
of
bitterness
lacks
balance
low
body
and
refreshing
not
a
great
beer
but
for
the
price
and
thirstquenchiness
in
the
summer
a
nice
one
to
have
around
poured
an
average
light
staw
color
with
minimal
lacing
and
head
smell
was
typical
lager
smell
taste
was
also
typical
but
a
bit
crisper
and
a
bit
more
flavor
than
most
american
macros
mouthfeel
was
light
and
crisp
drinkability
was
good
as
with
most
lagers
reminded
me
a
bit
of
heineken
slight
offsmell
a
good
mix
of
malt
and
hops
flavor
a
fairly
crisp
finish
nothing
outstanding
but
a
solid
brew
if
you
enjoy
heineken
i
highly
recommend
that
you
try
some
bavaria
opinion
well
this
is
a
pretty
decent
beer
and
one
that
i
would
put
up
there
with
heineken
it
sucks
that
it
comes
in
a
green
bottle
because
it
suffered
as
a
result
of
it
it
seems
a
bit
light
in
the
loafers
when
compared
to
other
german
pilsners
but
still
the
malt
complexity
and
balance
is
nice
this
is
not
my
absolute
favorite
beer
but
for
the
price
i
would
take
it
over
quite
a
few
others
could
deffenitly
drink
a
12
pack
if
that
is
what
i
chose
for
the
night
for
that
excallent
praice
who
can
complain
d
barely
ok
not
much
going
on
here
whats
next
very
easy
to
drink
and
very
refreshing
i
liked
it
for
what
it
was
so
it
aint
no
prima
pils
but
its
still
a
decent
pils
had
a
metallic
smell
to
it
low
head
great
lacing
however
it
lasted
quite
some
time
deep
golden
color
with
high
carbonation
i
thought
mouthfeel
was
mediumwatery
for
a
light
beer
an
import
version
of
a
lawnmower
beer
i
could
still
drink
a
few
after
getting
over
the
initial
aroma
d
not
bad
tasting
and
pretty
easy
to
put
down
a
few
finish
is
crisp
and
not
too
sweet
id
say
that
value
for
money
this
is
ranks
highly
in
the
eurolager
heap
heck
it
is
only
ten
cents
more
than
holsten
and
lasko
club
which
frankly
suck
overall
this
beer
seemed
to
be
a
toneddown
heineken
as
if
heineken
needed
toning
down
i
wouldnt
especially
recommend
it
unless
you
are
just
looking
for
a
different
take
on
the
euro
lager
dutch
beer
sold
in
my
country
3
years
ago
since
my
first
bottle
its
flavor
was
robust
with
body
but
im
not
impressed
because
is
a
dutch
beer
in
a
german
style
however
this
beer
is
good
for
a
european
cuisine
not
for
mexican
food
try
serve
this
beer
in
a
tall
mug
for
its
foam
and
appreciate
its
rich
blond
color
65
recommended
this
was
in
a
jumbo
16
9oz
bottle
since
i
was
outside
washing
the
motorcycle
i
just
drank
this
right
from
the
bottle
popped
the
cap
and
it
held
a
slight
white
head
for
quite
a
while
had
a
typical
pilsner
crispness
light
bodied
and
well
carbonated
decent
hoppy
finish
without
being
overpowering
since
it
was
such
a
big
bottle
it
started
warming
as
i
drank
it
but
taste
didnt
suffer
in
the
least
because
of
it
which
was
a
big
surprise
good
summer
brew
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
this
is
a
readily
available
in
supermarkets
for
not
a
lot
of
cash
i
thinkit
represents
reasonable
value
for
money
for
a
euro
macro
lager
that
you
dont
have
to
travel
to
find
yes
in
summertime
ill
buy
this
one
again
and
again
and
again
crisp
refreshing
drinkable
this
is
my
favorite
pilsener
they
used
to
sell
this
at
dominicks
for
10
99
a
twelver
and
i
would
buy
it
frequently
oh
well
is
this
a
pilsener
or
is
it
a
poor
amercian
adjunct
it
would
rate
slightly
higher
if
it
wasnt
classified
as
a
pilsener
it
barely
had
any
color
it
was
a
very
clear
light
yellow
it
had
some
head
that
hung
around
for
a
bit
taste
was
unimpressive
hops
barely
detectable
mouthfeel
was
like
drinking
a
poorly
carbonated
light
beer
i
imagined
what
coors
light
tasted
like
without
the
fizz
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
nonoffencive
you
could
give
this
to
a
budmiller
drinker
and
they
might
think
it
a
little
to
bitter
but
on
a
hot
day
this
would
go
down
easy
i
love
cheap
liquor
store
pickups
for
curiositys
sake
i
have
this
sitting
in
a
pint
glass
in
front
of
me
pours
just
a
tinge
darker
than
straw
yellow
virtually
no
head
but
very
slight
lacing
smell
has
a
touch
of
sweet
malt
with
just
a
bit
of
grassypeppery
hop
aroma
taste
is
well
taste
is
very
clean
and
mildy
sweet
before
a
very
gentle
hoppiness
rolls
over
the
tongue
hop
taste
has
a
decent
pepper
subtleness
typical
pale
lager
i
assume
unoffending
in
everyway
but
not
worth
repeated
drinking
in
my
opinion
overall
quite
refreshing
and
clean
a
very
drinkable
brew
if
a
little
forgettable
not
a
bad
lager
not
skunked
which
is
always
a
great
sign
pale
gold
with
a
bit
more
life
in
the
color
than
the
tuborg
i
had
just
prior
the
head
is
fuzzy
and
dry
looking
and
lasts
for
a
bit
the
flavor
is
definitely
on
the
adjuncty
side
but
not
offensive
the
flavor
is
soft
a
good
bit
of
rice
but
not
in
a
foul
way
very
low
bitterness
and
very
low
hop
aroma
very
soft
on
the
palate
this
beer
was
on
special
for
1
50
where
i
watched
lions
game
yesterday
so
decided
to
have
one
and
thats
all
i
could
really
handle
pours
a
deeper
yellow
than
most
adjunct
lagers
with
a
thin
white
head
that
was
gone
in
a
blink
of
an
eyearoma
was
a
little
skunky
with
big
doses
of
corn
husk
pretty
much
what
i
figured
taste
was
watery
and
very
bland
with
a
little
corn
flavor
this
brew
is
pretty
bad
it
didnt
even
measure
up
to
the
icehouse
the
other
beer
specialso
u
know
it
has
to
be
badi
would
take
aheineken
over
this
next
time
i
wont
care
about
the
specials
it
will
be
carolina
blond
all
day
pours
to
a
thin
white
head
that
dies
out
color
is
somewhat
darker
than
heineken
aroma
starts
skunky
and
once
the
skunk
goes
away
resolves
to
a
sweet
malt
and
noble
hops
aroma
that
is
typical
of
the
style
plus
an
added
aroma
of
fermented
corn
and
alcohol
flavor
is
very
unremarkable
for
the
stylenot
too
exciting
has
a
noticable
alcohol
kick
that
i
like
finishes
dry
my
wife
bought
this
for
me
this
evening
and
im
very
proud
of
her
at
4
50
for
the
six
pack
id
have
to
say
this
was
the
find
of
the
year
i
might
have
her
pick
up
a
few
more
for
my
non
ba
buddies
i
doubt
that
anyone
is
tripping
over
bavaria
holland
since
there
arent
that
many
reviews
if
you
happen
to
see
it
on
the
shelves
just
nod
and
walk
on
by
it
isnt
worth
your
time
or
your
money
this
might
be
the
most
heavily
carbonated
beer
that
i
have
ever
drank
its
so
fizzy
that
its
hard
to
swallow
right
out
of
the
bottle
which
is
a
shame
because
the
bottles
are
pretty
once
its
been
poured
into
a
glass
and
allowed
to
set
a
while
it
goes
down
alright
i
had
a
bottle
of
this
on
a
hot
day
in
texas
it
was
refreshing
but
not
very
satisfying
similar
to
heineken
in
its
malt
profile
being
grassy
rather
than
grainy
the
head
was
there
for
the
pour
but
disappeared
quickly
after
about
half
the
glass
i
was
thinking
about
something
better
for
my
next
beer
knowing
there
were
about
6
better
beers
in
the
fridge
it
had
a
slight
bitterness
which
lasted
just
a
bit
longer
than
the
swallow
if
you
dont
want
to
pay
more
than
3
for
a
6pack
this
is
the
beer
for
you
personally
id
prefer
something
more
substantial
i
paid
6
99
for
a
12
pack
of
bottles
of
bavaria
beer
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
cheapest
imports
ive
had
overall
bavaria
is
a
pretty
average
pilsener
in
appearance
smell
and
taste
nothing
unexpected
or
great
came
out
of
this
beer
but
overall
its
solid
enough
to
enjoy
at
a
good
price
i
would
choose
it
as
a
session
beer
over
much
of
the
similiarly
priced
macros
on
the
market
and
recommend
it
to
beer
fans
who
dont
always
feel
like
shelling
out
a
lot
of
cash
for
other
micros
and
exports
while
i
could
drink
some
of
these
i
probably
wouldnt
if
i
have
a
better
choice
strawcolored
in
appearance
with
a
thin
layer
of
offwhite
head
that
makes
a
decent
attempt
to
lace
the
glass
aromas
are
sweet
malty
with
a
hint
of
bitterness
and
an
overshadowing
skunked
facet
flavor
is
also
on
the
sweet
side
very
clean
crisp
and
shortlived
nothing
too
hefty
or
thoughtprovoking
finishes
again
with
the
sweetness
thin
and
lowbodied
not
drinkable
this
pours
like
the
perfect
lager
looks
great
clear
and
bright
golden
yellow
color
a
large
frothy
pure
white
head
of
foam
nice
lace
on
the
glass
pleasant
graininess
in
the
nose
gives
off
some
lemony
notes
and
some
sourness
the
taste
is
full
of
sweet
graininess
theres
a
soft
citus
hop
bite
in
there
too
but
its
hidden
well
and
has
no
harshness
light
malt
body
and
leaves
a
sticky
sweetness
in
the
throat
this
is
a
light
and
enjoyable
macroeuro
lager
comparable
to
say
a
stella
or
orangeboom
i
could
drink
more
of
this
too
bitter
to
have
more
than
one
overall
not
a
great
beer
cheaper
than
heineken
but
it
seems
to
smell
and
taste
that
way
as
well
it
poured
to
a
decent
pilsener
gold
but
thats
where
my
kind
words
end
is
that
rice
in
the
taste
the
colder
it
is
the
better
which
doesnt
speak
well
for
this
beers
quality
pours
a
clear
pale
yellowishorange
color
with
a
modest
offwhite
head
the
smell
consists
of
a
skunky
lemon
twang
hops
and
freshcut
grass
the
taste
is
very
comparable
to
heineken
with
the
common
lemony
hop
twang
again
and
an
earthy
grain
this
beer
is
very
light
bodied
and
finishes
with
a
hint
of
corn
sweetness
not
great
but
this
one
will
do
in
a
pinch
cheers
visually
this
beer
is
excellent
with
a
relatively
longlasting
head
and
a
glorious
golden
lager
colouration
looks
however
are
not
everything
it
has
a
clean
sweetish
taste
followed
by
a
crisp
faintly
bitter
finish
i
would
describe
this
beer
as
modest
but
likeable
it
doesnt
exactly
scream
out
with
flavour
but
what
is
there
is
sufficent
and
certainly
drinkable
as
other
reviewers
have
said
the
price
certainly
aids
in
appreciating
it
this
golden
pilsner
poured
a
nice
head
which
went
away
pretty
quickly
this
brew
had
a
sweet
smell
to
it
with
a
taste
to
match
with
not
much
of
a
hop
followthru
it
has
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
to
and
is
a
beer
i
would
drink
again
if
offered
to
me
but
one
i
would
not
seek
to
buy
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
thin
white
head
the
aroma
is
average
there
is
the
presence
of
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
is
a
bit
less
skunky
than
most
of
this
style
it
has
a
bit
of
green
glass
aroma
but
not
too
overpowering
the
taste
is
decent
it
is
light
and
actually
tasteful
it
has
a
bit
of
a
malty
aftertaste
which
pushes
it
ahead
of
most
purely
because
it
has
some
distinguishing
characteristic
it
is
quite
mellow
but
has
a
slight
metallic
flavor
to
it
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
well
for
a
pilsner
i
enjoyed
it
green
bottle
no
fresh
date
well
this
was
the
most
popular
imported
beer
in
kazakhstan
in
the
midnineties
thats
about
the
most
i
can
say
for
it
it
pours
a
perfectly
acceptable
utterly
unremarkable
clear
gold
with
a
small
white
head
that
sticks
around
a
bit
and
leaves
a
bit
of
lace
the
nose
is
powerful
actually
pungent
with
rice
or
grain
or
something
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
and
full
of
sourish
grain
the
taste
is
stale
malt
and
bad
bread
with
a
weak
hops
chaser
that
cant
break
through
the
mold
the
aftertaste
is
heavy
and
stale
not
a
good
product
not
something
i
drink
much
i
only
get
it
if
im
in
a
hurry
and
theres
nothing
better
it
does
go
down
the
trap
ok
overall
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
the
dutch
should
just
go
all
out
and
brew
a
mull
beer
that
would
at
least
make
their
beers
more
interesting
than
this
type
of
thing
12
oz
bottle
poured
a
typical
straw
yellow
color
with
a
good
head
that
lasted
and
some
good
lacing
on
the
glass
aroma
is
floral
and
sweet
that
is
all
i
can
say
good
about
this
taste
is
just
awful
watery
and
thin
with
some
bitterness
in
the
finish
this
is
one
beer
i
wont
bother
with
again
found
this
beer
for
5
99
a
12
pack
and
as
i
was
having
people
over
for
a
bbq
i
figured
id
get
this
as
a
back
up
i
was
pleasently
surprised
it
pours
a
nice
light
straw
colour
the
smell
is
what
i
expected
from
a
green
bottle
lager
but
it
was
lacking
the
typical
skunkiness
that
i
have
found
so
often
the
taste
was
similar
to
a
deskunked
fresh
heineken
it
was
nice
and
crisp
and
clean
with
the
hops
giving
it
a
nice
slight
bitterness
in
the
finish
while
i
cant
drink
more
than
on
heineken
cant
stand
it
i
found
my
self
thinking
that
this
was
not
too
bad
a
beer
and
much
more
drinkable
than
heineken
becks
or
other
green
bottle
euro
lagers
overall
a
suprisingly
average
beer
but
that
was
not
neccessarily
a
bad
thing
light
gold
color
medium
white
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
sweet
light
tasting
slightly
hoppy
fairly
standard
pilsner
style
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
and
round
nice
balance
nice
but
nothing
special
finish
is
clean
aftertaste
is
hoppy
slightly
bitter
flavor
is
clean
and
crisp
with
that
distinct
dutch
flavor
i
dont
know
what
it
is
maybe
the
yeast
but
it
has
a
specific
flavor
maybe
the
hopping
anyways
light
and
mildly
sweet
a
touch
of
cornlike
sweetness
with
lively
carbonation
and
a
sparkling
clean
mouthfeel
hops
are
well
done
and
adequately
provide
a
crisp
tangy
finish
aftertaste
is
negligible
disappearing
from
your
mouth
almost
as
soon
as
its
swallowed
i
was
happy
with
this
pilsner
and
i
walked
into
the
beer
without
any
preconceived
idea
of
what
it
would
be
like
i
honestly
had
no
idea
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
beer
pours
a
clear
medium
light
yellowish
golden
color
with
a
moderate
clingy
white
head
that
has
large
bubbles
the
smell
is
malty
with
fading
skunky
hoppiness
the
taste
is
cookielikesyruppy
sweetness
with
a
balancing
sharp
hoppiness
and
a
thin
to
moderate
mouthfeel
this
is
a
suprisingly
tasty
beer
that
i
think
would
be
extremely
nice
if
it
were
available
fresher
beer
pours
a
typical
pale
yellow
for
a
pils
style
head
dissipates
quickly
there
is
an
arome
but
i
cant
describe
it
well
somewhat
floral
im
getting
a
somewhat
bitter
aftertaste
which
is
surprising
given
the
thin
mouthfeel
and
watery
finish
ok
so
they
used
some
hops
really
not
much
to
get
excited
about
here
if
you
love
heineken
get
this
instead
and
save
two
bucks
on
the
sixer
if
you
love
good
beer
get
something
else
this
is
average
beer
all
the
way
not
much
different
than
our
domestic
macros
a
bad
beer
not
worth
having
twice
this
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
minimal
white
head
and
no
lace
a
delicate
nose
is
actually
very
nice
and
leaves
a
pleasant
bouquet
that
is
quite
clean
and
bright
the
flavor
is
sweet
with
very
little
hop
bitterness
if
any
clean
crisp
taste
with
no
lingering
aftertaste
the
body
is
very
light
but
not
watery
and
the
overall
sense
is
of
a
nice
sweet
light
beer
that
finishes
with
great
dryness
not
at
all
hateful
this
brew
poured
a
white
head
that
dissolved
fast
and
it
had
finesmall
bubbles
there
was
very
little
lacing
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
with
this
brew
there
was
carbonation
observed
with
this
brew
rising
to
the
top
in
my
opinion
the
aroma
was
fruity
and
citrusy
there
was
a
bitter
taste
to
this
brew
as
well
as
an
aftertaste
this
brew
poured
a
small
head
of
fine
to
large
sized
white
bubbles
that
soon
disappeared
it
had
a
straw
yellow
body
with
carbonation
continuously
rising
from
the
bottom
of
my
mug
it
has
a
strong
hop
aroma
and
a
fizzy
somewhat
bitter
start
that
lingers
well
into
its
bitter
finish
there
is
actually
some
hidden
flavors
other
than
those
from
the
hops
that
hides
itself
well
in
the
finish
they
were
somewhat
floral
in
flavor
not
that
bad
actually
just
not
very
good
and
lucky
me
i
chose
a
pint
can
to
sample
wee

pale
gold
with
loads
of
carbonation
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
where
they
meet
up
with
a
fluffy
white
head
theres
nothing
much
to
this
beer
seems
to
be
a
standard
lagar
from
holland
quite
similar
to
a
few
other
green
bottle
beers
ive
had
from
the
area

a
golden
color
little
head
which
leaves
quickly

is
floral
taste
is
full
bodoed
for
green
bottles
lightly
malty
with
nice
carbonation
very
refreshing
as
a
pilsner
should
be
floral
accents
in
the
taste
hops
present
but
the
malt
is
where
the
action
is
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
pours
a
clear
light
to
medium
golden
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
into
a
thin
and
patchy
lace
nose
is
sweet
malts
and
stale
grains
with
a
bit
of
skunkiness
very
light
and
crisp
mouthfeel
taste
is
sweet
grains
blended
with
some
notes
of
dried
grass
and
hay
and
is
somewhat
astringent
some
faint
notes
of
citrus
give
a
bit
of
a
tart
flavor
to
the
finish
this
is
not
a
beer
i
would
drink
often
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
persistent
white
head
that
leaves
quite
a
bit
of
lace
on
the
glass
aroma
of
honey
cooked
veggies
and
hay
also
a
very
slight
skunkyness
flavor
is
overly
sweet
with
a
herbalvegetal
finish
that
is
slightly
bitter
mouthfeel
is
smooth
but
watery
not
terrible
but
not
a
beer
that
im
likely
to
buy
again
poured
a
very
light
golden
color
with
a
white
frothy
head
that
faded
into
a
light
glaze
over
the
top
of
the
glass
that
left
a
good
lace
all
the
way
down
the
taste
was
not
at
all
what
i
expected
it
had
no
hint
of
skunk
like
its
other
more
famous
holland
brew
and
was
very
fresh
and
drinkable
i
would
seek
it
out
again
but
i
have
not
seen
it
anywhere
in
my
town
outside
of
the
beers
of
the
season
box
that
i
got
for
my
birthday
very
good
the
beer
pours
a
translucent
gold
or
straw
color
if
you
like
the
head
average
and
white
lace
covers
the
glass
malt
is
dominate
in
the
nose
lemon
like
crispness
somewhat
sweet
and
so
is
the
start
top
cadaverous
finish
astringent
minimally
hopped
droughty
aftertaste
and
not
a
beer
that
trips
my
trigger
if
i
were
a
fan
of
heineken
i
probably
would
have
liked
this
more
but
it
wasnt
bad
nonetheless
barest
touch
of
skunk
slunk
behind
a
grassyherbal
soft
aroma
sweet
grain
hinting
at
sweetfeed
with
a
sourish
finish
just
enough
hops
to
be
noticed
finish
was
very
clean
and
crisp
this
is
easily
my
favorite
hollish
beer
that
i
have
tried
it
easily
beats
heineken
and
is
even
a
step
or
two
above
st
pauli
girl
it
pours
a
golden
straw
color
with
decent
head
that
thins
out
to
a
layer
that
stays
on
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
the
smell
good
without
a
skunky
aroma
commonly
found
with
other
hollish
beers
the
taste
was
very
good
with
nice
maltiness
paired
with
the
hops
it
is
very
smooth
and
very
drinkable
this
is
a
great
brew
that
i
will
definitely
get
again
probably
many
times
the
best
part
is
that
it
is
imported
by
a
company
here
in
my
home
city
of
dallas
and
is
frequently
on
sale
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
on
those
hot
florida
summer
days
pours
an
absolutely
crystal
clear
deep
golden
body
topped
by
a
frothy
but
etheral
head
which
drops
to
a
minor
collar
and
whispy
surface
covering
within
seconds
the
aroma
offers
a
soft
grainy
maltiness
and
a
mildly
skunked
herbal
hoppiness
the
body
is
medium
with
a
finebubbled
carbonation
thats
just
below
standard
levels
2
4
volumes
co2
and
gives
a
light
tingle
on
the
tongue
before
becoming
fairly
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
melds
a
semirich
and
lightly
sweet
maltiness
with
a
lightly
earthy
and
herbal
hoppiness
so
well
that
they
appear
almost
as
one
id
imagine
that
this
might
be
a
factor
of
freshness
except
that
the
skunkiness
is
so
limited
and
the
bottle
appears
quite
new
if
its
possible
i
might
suggest
that
this
beer
is
too
well
balanced
it
seems
to
lose
character
as
its
become
quite
onesided
bitterness
is
clearly
present
as
is
hop
flavor
but
its
restrained
and
the
limited
level
of
carbonation
doesnt
help
to
bring
out
what
is
there
still
there
are
some
nice
malt
and
hop
flavors
in
this
easy
to
drink
beer
giving
it
a
fairly
good
drinkability
nice
but
overshadowed
by
many
other
european
pilseners
typical
european
lager
aroma
fairly
mild
skunkiness
and
once
that
fades
a
fairly
decent
creamygrassyhay
citrus
and
hops
bouquet
is
noticeable
the
palate
is
similar
to
the
nose
just
add
in
some
mouthwatering
literally
sourness
the
body
is
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
of
a
12inch
good
retention
and
decent
lace
all
aspects
of
this
beer
are
typical
for
the
style
if
you
like
the
style
try
it
i
feel
it
is
less
flavorful
that
grolsch
but
better
than
heineken
pleasant
medium
gold
in
color
with
a
thick
and
creamy
offwhite
head
with
good

lots
of
carbonation
sticky

the
glass
wall
pleasing
aroma
consists
of
grassy
notes
sweet
malt
lemon
and
slight
hops
flavor
begins
with
slightly
sweet
malts
and
a
surge
of
carbonation
mild
hops
rise
in
the
middle
of
the
taste
finish
is
dry
and
mildly
bitter
as
other
reviewers
have
noted
this
beer
is
a
good
value
i
paid
3
49
for
a
sixpack
of
12
oz
bottles
leaving
little
to
complain
about
clear
as
a
bell
just
on
the
gold
side
of
straw
in
color
head
is
very
white
and
a
pretty
dead
affair
after
40
seconds
a
little
clove
to
the
aroma
not
much
detectable
skunk
sweet
and
malty
upfront
a
little
sense
of
karo
syrup
and
an
unfortunate
walk
toward
elements
of
that
glue
on
the
back
of
brown
mailing
tape
finishes
quickly
thereafter
but
the
hops
are
mediocre
very
macrolike
forgetable
beer
in
practically
all
aspects
crystal
clear
golden
hue
efferevescent
topped
by
a
thick
fluffy
head
that
settles
into
a
moderate
lace
leaving
layer
cooked
veggies
grassy
hop
pungent
sulfur
and
grain
husk
in
aroma
the
off
putting
sweetness
and
astringent
grain
flavors
coupled
w
the
meager
hop
bitterness
and
lack
of
any
noteable
hop
flavor
render
this
brew
most
unenjoyable
and
rough
finishes
w
a
lingering
cabbage
soup
flavor
dextrin

a
drop
or
two
of
isomerized

acid
would
make
bavaria
more
palettable
barely
craptastic
sort
of
the
poormans
heineken
i
can
get
a
sixer
of
it
in
the
16
oz
cans
for
5
by
me
its
good
on
a
hot
summers
day
but
thats
about
it
whoa
its
drinkable
but
that
doesnt
make
it
good
or
interesting
cheap
though
so
its
not
a
total
waste
bavaria
ive
only
had
it
in
16

nice

a

notes
a

lager
better
than
the
usual
massmarketed
import
and
at
less
than

a
six
pack
it
is
a
steal
this
beer
reminds
me
of
tastier
version
of
a
budweiser
or
pbr
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
do
enjoy
the
light
mouthfeel
the
balance
of
hops
and
malt
is
appreciated
this
is
how
a
pilsner
should
taste
smooth
and
clean
reminds

of

really

be

german
brewers
are
not
immune
to
concerns
of
cost
efficiency
and
consistency
its
not
uncommon
for
bigger
commercial
ones
to
do
things
their
grandfathers
would
never
be
caught
dead
doing
by
and
large
however
theyve
maintained
higher
standards
krombacher
isnt
a
whole
lot
different
from
other
massproduced
lagers
in
its
price
range
but
it
is
a
bit
better
overall
an
average
pils
not
bad
tried
on
tap
at
beer
revolution
in
calgary
a
classic
lager
start
to
the
evening
i
have
also
tried
this
in
bottles
classic
german
pilsener
in
the
glass
a
gold
straw
color
with
a
smattering
of
white
foam
on
top
aroma
was
quite
subdued
i
do
not
possess
the
worlds
greatest
olfactory
sense
but
i
can
usually
get
more
than
this
especially
from
something
on
tap
faint
cracker
malts
and
musty
haylike
noble
hops
on
the
nose
and
more
of
the
same
on
the
palate
fortunately
i
could
taste
more
than
i
could
smell
the
aforementioned
noble
hops
were
prominent
and
fairly
enjoyable
fresh
grass
and
hay
playing
off
some
herbal
notes
like
mild
licorice
and
bitter
watermelon
rind
there
is
a
grainy
crackerlike
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
green
grape
fruitiness

a

husk

aggressive
carbonation
along
with
a
little
metallic
copper
afterburn

and
dry
with
less
residual

doughy
character
than
most
commercial
euro
lagers
a
decent
noble
hops
showcase
on
tap
less
fresh
in
the
bottles
ive
sampled
and
a
pretty
standard
german
pilsener
for
the
purists
albeit
one
with
a
macrobrewed
feel
fizzy
harsh
and
rather
vapid
a
brownishamber
beer
with
a
very
good
head
and
good
lacing
after
drinking
this
was
the
first
pilsner
that
i
managed
to
get
a
decent
amount
of
foam
with
the
smell
was
good
with
a
sweet
overtone
and
a
little
bread
the
taste
was
a
bit
of
a
letdown
as
there
wasnt
much
there
you
could
feel
the
beer
down
the
middle
of
the
palate
and
it
hit
all
the
sensors
but
it
just
did
not
thrill
me
overall
an
okay
beer
overall
drinkability
pretty
middle
of
the
road
pilsner
especially
for
a
european
one
overall
a
good
pilsener
that
is
better
than
many
but
wish
there
was
a
little
more
in
the
aroma
department
up
front
certainly
a
thirst
quencher
but
would
prefer
other
pilseners
in
comparison
to
this
one
overalleasy
drinking
german
pils
nothing
that
will
blow
your
socks
off
but
something
that
you
can
drink
multiple
times
without
thinking
or
worrying
about
much
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
foamy
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
film
on
top
of
the
beer
thin
rings
of
lace
line
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
intensely
skunky
after
the
pour
but
it
dissipates
over
time
and
gives
way
to
some
malt
grain
and
grassy
aromas
taste
is
much
the
same
with
grain
and
grassy
flavors
on
the
finish
there
is
a
very
mild
amount
of
hop
bitterness
on
the
palate
with
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
lower
level
of
carbonation
with
a
slightly
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
an
above
average
beer
that
is
drinkable
but
the
initial
blast
of
skunk
is
quite
unpleasant
overall

nothing
particularly
stand
outish
about
this
pils
not
bad
by
any
means
but
it
doesnt
stand
out
either
as
compared
to
other
german
pils
it
may
be
on
the
lighter
side
overall
a
decent
pils
but
by
no
means
the
best
from
germany
or
the
most
representative
of
the
style
very
easy
drinking
very
cheap
and
widely
available
in
germany
which
gives
it
a
poor
reputation
in
germany
as
a
fernsehbier
televisionbeer
i
would
not
seek
this
one
out
bought
in
sarajevo
at
a
neighborhood
grocery
store
pours
clear
golden
color
with
a
creamy
head
that
leaves
decent
lacing
smells
slightly
grassy
with
a
touch
of
sour
aroma
moderate
carbonation
some
hop
bitterness
and
decent
presence
of
malty
sweetness
smooth
and
drinkable
but
not
outstanding
nothing
to
distinguish
this
beer
from
other
similar
ones
just
an
average
german
pilsner
o
nothing
special
easy
drinking
enough
and
better
than
bmc
but
not
a
remarkable
in
anyway
overall
a
wellmade
german
pils
but
it
doesnt
necessarily
stick
out
among
the
many
others
out
there
worth
picking
up
for
something
different
not
a
bad
beer
depends
to
what
you
compared
it
still
lacks
personality
maybe
a
general
flaw
of
most
pilsners
offcourse
partially
you
have
to
attain
to
the
proposed
style
the
carbonation
is
quite
lively
and
lends
a
mouthfeel
that
compliments
the
flavor
nicely
and
really
holds
the
whole
thing
together
im
a
devout
detractor
of
pilsners
but
i
must
give
this
one
credit
for
bringing
something
different
to
the
table
and
keeping
me
interested
krombacher
has
fuller
flavor
and
substance
than
im
used
to
experiencing
in
this
style
so
i
will
certainly
credit
them
for
that
this
hardly
has
made
me
a
pilsner
man
but
if
obligated
to
have
one
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
500ml
bottle

o
this
is
a
very
easy
to
drink
beer
quite
sessionable

enjoyable
nothing
special
about
this
beer
but
definitely
a
beer
that
would
be
easy
to
have
a
couple
in
a
sitting
would
pair
well
with
a
meatheavy
german
meal
as
a
german
pilsner
its
right
on
quite
nice
o
like
taking
a
yeasty
roll
in
the
hay
this
pils
embodies
that
simmering
hot
summer
day
when
you
were
too
stupid
too
poor
and
too
sweaty
to
linger
in
the
beer
isle
the
problem
with
his
beer
boys
and
girls
is
that
as
soon
as
the
chill
haze
wears
off
so
does
the
delightful
bitter
carbonated
refreshment
that
first
excites
you
not
unlike
young
love
this
beer
is
good
for
a
quick
july
night

an
ok
drink
but
that
being
said
it
is
most
likely
one
and
done
for
me
final
grade
3
56
a
manageable
b
grade
unremarkable
yet
still
highly
drinkable
krombacher
pils
is
one
addition
to
the
lcbos
staggeringly
huge
lineup
of
pale
lagers
that
i
can
appreciate
now
if
only
theyd
get
rid
of
all
those
lame
ones
and
use
that
space
for
something
more
interesting
but
i
digress
this
is
a
respectable
affordable
pilsener
that
is
at
least
worth
a
try
for
any
fan
of
german
pale
lagers
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
light
golden
with
a
decent
sized
rocky
white
head
that
was
gone
pretty
quickly
the
nose
is
very
clean
too
cleana
bit
of
toasted
grain
and
faint
hint
of
iron
and
thats
about
it
mild
flavors
of
toasted
bread
and
that
iron
notelight
sweetness
in
the
finish
eh
i
wanted
something
i
could
drink
while
grillin
in
the
heati
could
have
done
better
o
its
on
the
mark
in
terms
of
ease
of
drinking
and
feel
but
it
is
just
a
little
lacing
in
the
flavour
department
i
get
the
feeling
this
is
a
get
it
down
your
gullet
type
of
mass
consumed
brew
in
germany
not
bad
but
an
average
pils
overall
while
it
is
very
drinkable
i
was
hoping
for
a
little
more
of
a
refreshing
tasteflavour
it
had
a
grainyherbal
bitterness
to
it
that
seemed
to
take
away
from
the
crispness
still
a
decent
beer
just
not
something
id
buy
again
overall
a
perfect
summer
beer
ill
be
picking
up
a
lot
more
of
this
stuff
this
german
pilsnener
can
be
compared
to
many
premium
lagers
out
of
germany
to
me
it
was
nothing
new
but
what
keeps
this
lager
legitimate
is
the
authenticity
of
the
style
very
refreshing
for
the
summer
months
o
this
is
a
welldone
clean
and
crisp
german
pils
with
nothing
outstanding
yet
absolutely
refreshing
and
satisfying
and
highly
sessionable
at
4
8
i
may
have
to
get
more
for
the
coming
summer
weekends
at
13
a
12
pack
o
theres
nothing
overly
special
about
this
pilsener
but
its
quite
easy
to
drink
and
would
pair
well
with
some
german
food
rjt
overall
not
the
best
pils
but
decent
flavor
was
perfectly
fine
just
not
out
of
this
world
tasted
like
a
pilsner
but
not
as
much
bite
on
the
tongue
that
i
usually
like
from
a
german
pilsner
can
half
a
litre
at
home
poured
a
golden
yellow
colour
with
a
two
finger
head
that
soon
went
away
but
stayed
enough
to
protect
the
surface
average
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
aroma
is
of
malts
and
something
i
cant
put
my
finger
on
but
quite
pleasant
taste
is
bitter
and
metallic
medium
bodied
leaves
a
dryness
on
your
tongue
average
carbonation
overall
one
step
ahead
of
your
average
german
pilseners
picked
up
a
single
at
euro
market
tastes
like
your
standard
german
pils
theres
clean
bready
malts
and
as
the
lager
warms
a
pleasant
herbal
lemon
hops
edge
emerges
its
not
the
most
complex
pils
but
the
right
flavors
are
there
its
satisfying
and
very
drinkable
by
memory
its
fairly
similar
to
bitburger
which
is
not
a
bad
place
to
be
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
pick
this
up
but
its
not
a
bad
option
i
picked
this
one
up
as
a
mixedsixer
to
sample
a
brew
that
i
first
had
on
a
trip
germany
it
was
a
pleasant
trip
down
memory
lane
and
a
decent
brew
but
nothing
outstanding
very
light
taste
more
of
the
lemony
character
mouthfeel
extremely
faint
almost
no
malt
character
the
yeast
was
nice
and
neutral
a
pretty
neutral
beer
overall
the
price
is
a
little
much
from
when
i
first
got
turned
on
to
these
back
in
milwaukee
at
koppas
and
the
annex
i
think
the
draft
version
had
less
bitterness
to
it
halfway
down
it
would
recede
into
a
smoother
creamier
experience
this
is
a
good
looking
beer
with
light
pale
yellow
in
color
and
thick
foamy
head
that
well
retain
itself
also
left
some
decent
laces
visible
carbonation
is
high
smell
is
like
typical
germans
pils
with
bready
malt
and
spicy
floral
hop
in
nose
yet
a
bit
herbal
breadgrain
malt
also
dwells
in
its
taste
with
moderate
bitterness
from
hop
to
balance
overall
it
is
decent
and
goes
down
well
easy
a
decent
pilsner
crisp
and
refreshing
with
a
hoppy
bite
slides
down
nicely
i
could
imagine
sinking
a
few
steins
of
this
opinion
well
i
must
say
that
i
am
enjoying
this
beer
quite
a
bit
i
personally
like
a
pilsner
that
is
more
like
a
helles
so
this
one
fits
the
bill
nicely
that
said
it
is
a
bit
light
in
the
hop
department
for
this
style
but
you
expect
that
a
bit
since
it
is
brewed
more
in
the
middle
of
the
country
than
in
the
north
where
the
beers
are
notably
more
hoppy
either
way
if
you
like
pilsners
or
helles
i
would
give
this
one
a
shot
on
a
clean
palate
and
i
dont
think
that
you
will
be
disappointed
decent
but
not
great
not
the
most
solid
pils
ive
had
unfortunately
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
overall
i
received
this
as
a
regift
my
aunt
received
it
from
a
german
exchange
student
the
bottle
had
a
bestbefore
date
of
midaugust
so
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
how
good
it
tasted
despite
being
out
of
date
brown
bottle
and
constant
refrigeration
probably
helped
anyway
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
with
a
little
more
corn
flavor
than
it
probably
should
have
but
thats
ok
with
me
12
oz

born

nice

finger
tightly
bubbled
head
pours
light
straw
colored
with
good
lacing
aroma
is
bready
malt
taste
some
subtle
spicy
hops
but
overall
a
bit
underwhelming
a
little
metallic
and
sour
nice
crisp
mouthfeel
but
smooth
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
always
been
a
big
fan
of
german
pilseners
and
this
ones
a
decent
selection
but
nothing
that
really
stands
out
overall
a
very
basic
simple
standard
pils
it
gets
the
job
done
but
doesnt
have
that
lil
extra
something
magical
to
keep
me
coming
krombach
for
more
my
cuz
married
a
german
bird
and
he
and
his
hottie
are
krombacher
fans
so
i
bought
some
for
them
on
their
recent
visit
this
is
a
typical
german
style
pils
the
color
is
golden
clear
with
good
carbonation
that
provides
a
thin
white
head
that
appears
to
be
lacing
grain
and
barley
power
the
aroma
on
this
beer
not
much
else
the
taste
is
a
standard
german
pils
with
a
kick
of
wheatbarleygrain
mouthfeel
is
good
on
the
lighter
side
which
makes
for
a
good
session
overall
its
a
good
german
pils
o
this
a
good
representative
of
a
german
pilsner
not
bad
tastes
a
little
swilly
and
metallic
wet
and
bready
with
some
pilsner
malt
and
vague
residual
bitterness
in
the
back
after
a
bigger
swig
clean
enough
somewhat
crisp
and
quenching
in
hot
weather
pretty
utilitarian
though
you
could
do
plenty
worse
nice
pour
good
golden
clarity
plenty
of
white
head
and
head
retains
fairly
well
nose
is
very
light
with
a
whiff
of
herbal
hops
some
skunk
and
grain
palate
is
cereal
grain
sweet
light
and
almost
adjuncty
with
a
semibrisk
balance
from
the
hops
some
hops
linger
on
the
finish
too
but
then
the
cereal
grain
just
wont
go
away
even
on
the
aftertaste
a
good
pilsner
for
some
reason
its
hard
to
find
good
ones
anywhere
poured
a
nice
light
straw
color
with
a
good
head
on
it
very
fragrant
nose
with
lots
of
grains
malty
tones
and
some
straw
tones
as
well
medium
bodied
that
is
more
grainy
on
the
palate
than
on
the
nose
very
good
feel
that
is
very
smooth
as
well
this
is
an
excellent
session
pilsner
that
scratches
the
itch
perfectly
11
2
oz
bottle
in
the
us
not
as
good
but
it
is
freshly
imported
and
isnt
too
bad
o
its
very
easy
drinking
a
good
german
pils
this
is
a
simple
and
clean
pilsner
overall
which
makes
very
refreshing
no
outstanding
features
but
sometimes
simpleness
is
good
worth
a
try
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
at
gathaus
gutenberger
with
a
giant
plate
of
great
german
food
it
wasnt
anything
special
but
it
did
the
job
i
would
gladly
have
another
glass
of
this
there
its
drinkable
enough
drinkability
decent
for
the
style
nothing
to
write
home
about
light
body
and
good
carbonation
very
drinkable
although
abit
tin
in
the
flavour
department
it
is
a
worthy
pils
with
no
major
flaws
drinkability
unfortunately
i
poured
this
before
it
had
enough
time
to
chill
properly
so
this
might
have
affected
my
experience
im
a
mere
acolyte
and
this
is
my
first
pilsner
review
and
i
have
to
say
i
think
this
isnt
the
beer
style
for
me
the
bite
of
the
bitterness
really
isnt
to
my
liking
but
that
said
you
live
and
learn
d
when
your
appearance
is
the
best
thing
by
far
and
you
are
a
product
to
be
consumed
that
is
not
a
good
sign
d
a
bit
light
in
flavour
even
for
a
pilsner
but
still
a
decent
one
to
drink
d
good
beer
better
cold
than
warm
and
one
of
the
better
german
pilsners
ive
had
in
germany
there
is
either
a
lack
of
good
pilsners
or
i
had
a
particularly
difficult
time
finding
them
having
tried
several
nasty
examples
i
was
quite
happy
to
find
the
krombaacher
3
5
pours
a
nice
straw
yellow
color
with
a
tiny
hint
of
cloudiness
the
head
does
disappear
kinda
quick
but
it
does
stick
around
for
little
bit
like
a
minute
or
so
smells
like
a
typical
german
pilsener
tastes
like
a
typical
german
pilsener
but
overall
it
does
go
down
fairly
easily
not
too
over
carbonated
and
has
an
o
k
lingering
aftertaste
which
is
not
too
bad
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
the
greatest
hint
of
spicy
hops
not
sure
on
that
one
everyone
i
know
says
this
beer
is
super
its
just
not
doin
it
for
me
its
good
not
super
but
i
think
its
clean
light
crisp
taste
would
go
very
well
on
a
hot
day
after
revisiting
krombacher
ive
come
to
realize
that
it
competes
nicely
with
my
beloved
könig
with
a
more
satisfying
maltiness
to
boot
something
weird
going
on
here
this
is
the
3rd
bottlecan
in
a
row
from
the
same
store
all
different
brewers
that
have
been
somewhat
flat
this
one
poured
with
a
large
fluffy
foamy
thick
white
head
that
lasts
a
while
and
some
lace
color
is
a
clear
yellow
aroma
is
malt
hop
grain
flavor
is
like
nose
and
has
a
good
bittersweet
balance
but
again
the
tang
of
carbonic
acid
is
missing
body
itself
is
quite
good
but
is
hampered
by
the
lame
carbonation
finish
is
like
flavor
and
slowly
tapers
off
in
medium
length
really
could
have
given
this
beer
a
much
higher
score
were
it
not
for
the
bubbles
which
are
crucial
to
a
pilsner
of
any
type
including
the
germans
for
some
examples
appearance
the
image
of
the
clear
yellow
liquid
with
a
couple
little
trails
of
bubbles
rising
to
the
top
is
a
key
part
of
its
beauty
in
aroma
its
that
gas
coming
out
of
solution
that
carries
some
of
those
components
to
the
nose
need
that
gas
man
d
overall
a
nice
german
pilsener
if
the
taste
had
been
a
little
stronger
and
the
aftertaste
a
little
longer
and
more
bitter
this
would
have
been
worldclass
d
easy
to
drink
which
is
about
all
that
it
has
going
for
it
looks
like
a
sexy
blonde
as
w3ell
when
poured
that
gives
big
head
o
just
kidding
but
the
drinkability
of
this
served
cold
in
a
pils
glass
on
a
warm
summer
night
was
immense
id
drink
this
again
its
a
decent
beer
i
wish
our
macros
had
some
flavor
like
the
germans
very
pleasant
full
flavoured
approachable
pilsner
one
of
the
better
export
german
pils
a
refreshing
easydrinker
i
wish
all
mass
produced
domestic
lagers
were
at
least
at
this
calibre
not
bad
very
knockbackable
nothing
special
however
and
not
one
ill
actively
seek
out
again
a
very
enjoyable
and
drinkable
beer
which
can
be
drank
all
over
germany
it
is
a
well
known
and
commercial
beer
a
pleasant
enough
pilsener
nothing
revelatory
yet
it
works
well
with
the
usual
culinary
suspects
better
beer
plus
better
pizza
what
a
concept
i
could
drink
maybe
one
more
the
beer
looks
just
fine
though
with
a
shortlived
head
and
decent
lacing
the
taste
is
hoppier
than
the
nose
led
me
to
believe
but
its
still
very
grainy
and
yeasty
for
the
style
the
mouthfeel
is
light
almost
watery
and
although
its
drinkable
its
definitely
not
a
mustdrink
it
was
much
better
for
washing
down
my
curry
tonight
than
it
was
on
its
own
overall
nice
crisp
and
refreshing
pilsen
well
balanced
i
could
happily
have
another
one
a
good
solid
pils
although
not
the
best
this
country
has
to
offer
and
yet
another
europils
that
easily
eclipses
the
crappy
and
stupidly
popular
u
s
corporate
versions
this
might
work
better
for
me
washing
down
some
curry
but
by
itself
it
is
a
bit
bland
drinkability
ill
bet
this
beer
is
pretty
damn
good
vom
fass
in
deutschland
but
this
bottled
version
may
have
arrived
a
tad
late
to
our
shores
for
a
real
good
judgement
on
it
still
if
i
were
a
peasant
farmer
in
rural
germany
this
beer
is
the
one
id
ask
for
on
a
hot
summer
day
after
working
in
the
fields
it
does
go
down
rather
easy
light
pale
gold
color
with
a
big
creamy
head
on
top
this
beer
has
a
sweet
pale
malt
aroma
and
the
taste
takes
the
same
route
as
the
aroma
its
very
sweet
with
the
usual
grassy
and
floral
notes
trailing
behind
some
might
find
this
to
be
a
little
sweet
but
i
can
dig
it
it
worked
well
washing
down
my
grilled
chicken
entree
d
extremely
quaffable
and
easy
drinking
lacks
the
complexity
of
some
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
but
its
still
a
pleasing
beer
to
slake
a
thirst
after
a
workout
as
im
doing
just
now
not
bad
but
slightly
forgettable
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
ill
probably
pick
up
again
without
realizing
that
ive
already
tried
it
then
ill
get
home
and
check
ba
and
be
slightly
aggravated
that
i
didnt
recall
ever
having
it
that
happens
a
lot
with
german
beers
since
all
of
the
bottles
have
the
same
shape
and
many
of
the
labels
lack
the
cartoony
or
artistic
imagination
of
belgian
or
american
breweries
d
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
german
pilsener
there
is
nothing
specatacular
about
this
beer
but
it
is
done
well
and
is
definitely
sessionable
i
will
happily
drink
this
again
real
pilsner
feel
to
this
beer
a
good
example
of
the
style
i
know
this
beer
from
old
and
it
has
stood
the
test
of
time
better
than
some
ive
revisited
lately
this
is
about
as
refreshing
as
one
can
get
in
the
lager
family
definitely
totally
balanced
and
is
a
swell
session
cervesa
not
bad
not
good
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
more
than
acceptable
this
brew
was
a
decent
surprise
a
perfect
beer
to
have
with
some
german
fare
such
as
some
jaegerschnitzel
or
some
wursts
this
was
a
a
nice
solid
brew
a
good
representation
of
a
pils
are
there
better
sure
but
you
can
do
a
lot
worse
than
this
very
enjoyable
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
again
and
1
89
for
a
17
oz
single
wasnt
that
pricey
its
on
the
sweeter
side
vs
sharp
hops
if
that
bothers
you
then
find
another
pils
this
runs
under
premium
in
the
shop
where
i
bought
it
but
my
best
guess
is
this
being
the
same
brew
quite
surprising
quality
for
a
canned
lager
to
start
with
there
is
everything
you
would
expect
from
this
type
of
beer
a
nice
foam
a
hoppy
smell
a
balanced
taste
between
hops
and
malt
and
unfortunately
also
a
sour
aftertaste
from
a
liter
can
this
brew
is
light
and
golden
the
head
is
puffy
white
and
nicely
soapy
theres
a
respectable
lace
the
beer
presents
a
perfumy
hoppy
smell
thats
backed
with
a
little
pale
malt
not
bad
actually
theres
a
bit
of
a
bread
and
dough
flavor
that
comes
out
in
the
taste
unfortunately
theres
a
bit
of
a
metallic
quality
that
shows
up
in
the
midtaste
the
finish
is
subtle
and
soft
medium
to
light
in
mouthfeel
with
a
smooth
quality
this
is
a
respectable
and
nicely
drinkable
brew
overall
an
average
pils
nothing
too
exciting
here
easy
enough
to
drink
however
golden
orange
in
color
and
a
nice
airy
white
head
dissipating
to
a
thin
patchy
cap
the
nose
was
fair
by
standard
with
a
floral
hop
aroma
taste
is
bitter
and
dry
off
the
bat
and
an
earthy
woodsy
background
carbonated
well
and
crisp
the
finish
is
dry
and
a
little
metallic
like
but
further
turns
sweeter
and
crackerish
it
coats
well
for
an
enjoyable
mouth
nice
balance
overall
with
just
enough
malt
character
to
match
the
hops
krombacher
pils
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
fluffy
white
head
from
a
brown
500
ml
bottle
the
aroma
is
very
mild
a
hint
of
hops
maybe
malt
dominates
the
flavor
at
first
followed
by
a
metallic
hop
taste
more
malty
than
hoppy
id
pass
and
try
something
else
this
beer
is
not
very
tastey
not
enough
hops
even
for
an
international
pilsner
also
some
funky
off
flavors
just
a
notch
or
two
above
undrinkable
a
fair
pils
from
germany
pours
out
to
a
medium
golden
color
with
a
big
head
of
fluffy
white
foam
lots
of
lace
medium
level
of
carbonation
aromas
of
sour
maltiness
and
some
floral
hops
taste
is
suprisingly
fresh
and
light
flavors
of
medium
bodied
malts
cross
over
to
a
white
bread
note
with
hints
of
floral
hops
lingering
in
the
background
not
bad
mouthfeel
was
crisp
and
enjoyable
drinkability
is
north
of
average
this
would
make
for
a
good
light
evening
beer
worth
a
try
smell
is
very
bready
and
malty
nice
hint
of
aroma
hops
hidden
in
there
nothing
much
complex
slight
veggie
smell
but
not
skunky
or
unpleasant
very
much
just
a
refreshing
pilsner
aroma
taste
is
very
pleasant
very
malty
and
a
slight
nuttiness
in
the
back
low
bitterness
but
enough
to
keep
it
interesting
mouthfeel
isnt
as
bitey
as
id
like
but
its
a
mild
complaint
this
is
a
slightly
above
average
pils
thirstquenching
and
highly
drinkable
not
the
best
ever
but
good
medium
gold
in
colour
with
lots
of
carbonation
aromas
begin
with
sulfur
then
eventually
reveal
some
honey
malt
and
grassy
hop
notes
some
grassy
and
spicy
hop
flavor
notes
are
there
along
with
some
more
light
malt
notes
on
the
back
end
its
got
a
bitter
soapy
finish
too
which
isnt
as
clean
as
id
like
slightly
below
average
for
the
style
taste
is
also
fresh
and
has
good
but
not
that
high
dosed
bitterness
that
keeps
hanging
in
my
mouth
further
again
good
maltpalate
but
imo
litle
too
much
for
a
pils
and
the
whole
beer
reminds
me
more
of
a
helles
then
a
pilsner
easy
drinkable
and
a
good
sesionbeer
for
a
heavy
night
of
drinking
but
there
are
lots
of
more
enjoyable
pilseners
that
i
would
prefer
to
drink
not
an
exquisite
beer
but
tasty
and
goes
down
the
hatch
quite
easily
this
is
workmanlike
blue
collar
beer
typical
of
the
style
sharp
grainy
nose
on
a
malt
background
fizzy
bite
bitter
hops
some
malt
no
really
well
pronounced
flavours
or
aromas
dry
and
hoppy
your
average
euro
pils
good
with
a
sandwich
or
sausage
this
is
a
much
better
beer
on
tap
a
good
session
lager
i
picked
up
a
6
pack
of
this
stuff
for
the
first
time
because
my
wife
likes
pilsners
and
isnt
crazy
about
hefe
weisse
which
i
have
been
drinking
almost
exclusively
latley
yellow
gold
with
a
frothy
but
small
head
mild
hop
aroma
and
the
taste
is
a
little
too
sweet
like
beer
mixed
with
a
sweet
white
wine
this
stuff
is
smooth
and
drinkable
though
i
prefer
a
little
drier
crisper
pilsner
but
this
is
ok
in
a
pinch
perhaps
this
better
in
some
other
format
or
undoubtedly
when
fresher
as
any
beer
is
but
this
sample
was
unsatisfactory
most
popular
beer
in
germany
they
told
us
i
really
liked
the
initial
flavour
but
ultimately
the
bitterness
to
the
exclusion
of
malt
didnt
allow
enough
balance
to
make
it
pleasing
throughout
when
i
opened
the
bottle
i
immediately
thought
damn
my
first
skunked
beer
in
germany
luckily
that
was
not
the
case
nevertheless
it
made
me
very
reluctant
to
take
that
first
sip
when
i
did
i
was
relieved
that
it
was
still
good
color
is
pale
and
has
the
color
of
urine
the
morning
after
a
hard
nights
drinking
not
something
that
makes
you
go
yum
taste
is
drinkable
its
nothing
great
nothing
bada
perfect
3
herby
flavors
are
there
along
with
a
dominate
but
lightly
bitter
hop
profile
mouthfeel
is
comparable
to
memories
of
american
macrolagers
and
not
of
any
german
pils
ive
had
before
drinkability
i
would
drink
krombacher
pils
again
beer
drinkers
in
south
korea
cant
afford
to
be
too
particular
and
i
am
thinking
about
picking
up
a
5
litre
keg
because
this
pilsener
certainly
beats
most
of
the
other
available
options
pours
out
a
white
head
with
a
beautiful
golden
colour
not
much
nose
but
that
seems
alright
to
me
in
the
mouth
there
is
a
taste
of
malt
and
an
aftertaste
of
hops
that
lasts
after
it
goes
down
i
like
that
its
nice
to
be
reminded
you
just
had
a
swallow
of
a
decent
beer
i
love
that
aftertaste
krombacher
pils
is
one
of
those
beers
that
one
needs
to
come
back
to
after
trying
different
brews
it
brings
you
back
to
basics
the
is
a
light
beer
where
the
hops
grab
you
tongue
and
does
the
hula
this
is
a
bright
and
nice
beer
light
gold
color
large
foamy
head
aroma
is
grainy
and
slightly
sweet
a
medium
bodied
pilsner
crisp
and
refreshing
light
malt
and
hops
nice
balance
smooth
taste
mouthfeel
is
full
round
and
smooth
finish
is
clean
and
smooth
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
nice
pilsner
this
is
a
top
german
pilsner
clear
gold
lies
under
a
beautifully
contoured
white
head
that
lingers
all
the
way
to
the
bottom
leaving
a
veritable
blanket
of
lace
all
along
the
side
the
smell
is
a
wellbalanced
mix
of
malt
and
flowery
hops
the
mouthfeel
is
just
a
tad
tingly
and
dominated
by
malt
the
taste
starts
as
sweet
barley
with
a
lovely
flowery
hop
bitterness
giving
chase
the
aftertaste
is
all
hops
a
fine
product
indeed
this
brew
has
a
light
and
grainy
aroma
that
hints
at
caramel
pours
a
light
sparkling
golden
the
huge
fluffy
white
head
has
excellent
lacing
and
is
everlasting
with
a
full
2
inches
remaining
at
the
bottom
of
my
pilsener
flute
the
sweet
flavor
has
no
acidity
and
finishes
mildly
bitter
the
light
watery
palate
is
lively
and
finishes
clean
probably
better
on
tap
since
i
did
detect
the
typical
aluminum
flash
of
stagnicity
in
the
aftertaste
average
german
beer
with
nothing
special
to
make
you
want
to
drink
this
beer
in
the
pubs
or
with
food
its
one
of
those
notbadnotgood
beers
which
you
would
go
for
an
alternative
if
there
was
one
but
wouldnt
refuse
to
drink
it
if
there
wasnt
any
other
beer
yeah
i
liked
it
ok
sweetsih
palate
with
mild
maltiness
and
hoppiness
quite
light
in
body
thinish
palate
but
highly
drinkable
and
inoffensive
maybe
a
bit
fizzy
aswell
taken
from
a
5
liter
minikeg
classic
german
pils
taste
wellbalanced
sweet
pale
malts
and
noble
hops
i
have
to
believe
the
minikeg
served
this
beer
well
as
it
was
smoother
than
most
germanstyle
pilsners
ive
had
and
had
no
hint
of
sulfur
or
skunk
would
be
interesting
to
compare
to
the
bottled
version
fairly
average
pilsener
bottle
is
a
lighter
shade
of
brown
needs
to
be
a
little
darker
as
mine
had
a
slighty
lightstruck
skunky
aroma
ok
but
nothing
special
not
a
bad
drop
from
a
country
not
usually
associated
with
beer
try
it
light
sweet
very
carbonated
and
broke
the
style
mold
i
would
buy
again
refreshing
enjoy
can
poured
a
light
yellow
color
pils
with
a
medium
white
foamy
head
with
light
retention
and
light
lacing
aroma
of
light
sweet
adjunct
notes
is
pretty
bland
taste
is
also
dominated
by
sweet
adjunct
notes
with
limited
character
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
just
another
bland
adjunct
based
pils
i
dont
know
if
this
beer
being
a
little
over
2
years
past
the
best
by
date
has
had
any
affect
on
the
beer
itself
but
i
wouldnt
buy
this
beer
ever
again
i
think
carlsberg
and
heinkein
have
this
beer
beat
hands
down
in
flavor
and
drinkability
if
for
some
crazy
reason
i
decide
to
buy
efes
pilsner
again
it
would
be
to
see
how
a
fresher
bottle
tastes
but
this
stuff
is
on
the
verge
of
being
gross
very
average
beer
drinkable
not
bad
but
nothing
special
golden
malt
round
flavor
weak
head
pleasant
effervescence
with
the
dozens
of
supposedly
european
beers
around
efes
stays
one
of
the
best
imported
beers
with
a
soft
feel
on
an
amazing
taste
and
alcohol
content
endured
across
my
honeymoon
in
turkey
did
not
like
was
not
impressed
tried
repeatedly
and
found
myself
questioning
my
order
each
timeoftentimes
the
only
beer
on
the
menu
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
better
than
raki
but
thats
saying
very
little
too
sweet
too
yeasty
no
body
no
smell
the
best
thing
i
can
say
is
that
it
poured
a
nice
light
golden
color
and
had
a
foamy
head
in
bottle
have
nothing
against
beers
that
has
a
rich
taste
of
yeast
unless
there
are
other
flavors
in
the
beer
which
this
turk
is
obviously
lacking
smells
nice
but
the
taste
is
not
as
good
as
the
aroma
pours
a
clear
gold
color
and
shows
very
little
head
the
aroma
is
very
light
and
maybe
getting
a
touch
of
hops
the
flavor
is
malty
and
there
is
a
carbonated
fizziness
that
shines
through
overall
a
decent
beer
but
lacks
a
little
more
boldness
in
the
flavor
not
bad
for
a
turkish
beer
mundane
pilsners
except
its
10
00
a
six
pack
price
tag
overall
i
think
a
wonderful
example
of
the
style
of
beer
top
class
and
glad
i
have
another
bottle
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
be
75
o
sweet
pils
lager
its
really
nice
overall
a
very
pleasant
surprise
and
one
i
certainly
wouldnt
say
no
to
if
it
popped
up
somewhere
here
in
pa
overall
definitely
still
a
quality
pilsner
and
one
of
the
better
examples
of
the
style
if
this
style
were
held
in
higher
esteem
this
brew
would
get
a
lot
more
press
its
not
quite
the
same
drinking
this
at
age
34
on
a
cold
rainy
afternoon
as
it
was
ten
years
ago
in
the
turkish
sun
but
quality
is
quality
and
its
just
as
good
as
i
remember
it
give
it
a
try
with
an
open
mind
the
taste
is
initially
slightly
on
the
sweet
side
followed
by
a
nice
and
refreshing
bitterness
the
finish
is
hoppy
and
bittery
the
taste
is
light
but
not
watery
very
drinkable
and
extremelly
refreshing
great
lager
beer
found
in
turkey
and
you
can
taste
over
80
countries
o
this
was
actually
pretty
decent
and
better
than
i
thought
it
was
going
to
be
i
would
be
content
drinking
this
although
i
didnt
really
get
much
hop
character
and
i
felt
it
was
a
bit
odd
as
a
german
pilsener
this
would
be
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
day
it
would
also
be
good
for
when
you
did
not
want
something
complex
to
drink
about
given
the
colour
and
taste
this
would
serve
as
a
good
beer
to
transition
friends
away
from
regular
beers
it
went
nicely
with
food
as
well
efes
brings
back
fond
memories
of
being
young
being
somewhere
exoctic
and
having
a
really
good
go
to
beer
to
wash
down
lamb
kebobs
or
sea
food
on
the
med
coast
ive
never
seen
it
since
but
would
buy
it
if
i
did
it
was
efes
that
started
a
lifelong
love
of
pilsner
for
me
i
sure
hope
its
the
same
now
as
it
was
back
in
1978
o
turks
drink
the
hell
out
of
this
beer
and
relative
to
the
light
lager
a
stereotypical
american
consumes
this
brew
is
a
win
by
no
means
memorable
this
dominates
the
norm
back
in
the
states
overall
not
bad
truth
be
told
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
about
this
brew
but
i
would
definitely
take
one
if
offered
all
in
all
and
taking
into
account
that
its
just
a
massproduced
pils
i
dont
think
its
too
bad
at
all
but
please
remember
to
read
this
review
in
the
context
of
the
beer
desert
that
is
north
cyprus
overallcomments
this
was
and
average
beer
overall
that
really
didnt
stand
out
in
any
way
at
all
very
light
not
overly
filling
glad
i
tried
this
turkish
beer
to
broaden
my
horizons
classified
as
a
german
pilsner
5
abv
consumed
4242013
a
highly
drinkable
euro
lager
good
flavor
easy
going
and
refreshing
definitely
a
good
brew
to
throw
back
with
some
spicy
eastern
turkish
food
o
this
beer
has
a
nice
pilsner
smell
but
that
doesnt
translate
at
all
in
the
flavor
it
is
very
clean
and
washed
out
above
average
adjunct
lager
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
if
you
like
the
style
it
is
definitely
worth
a
try
give
it
a
pass
a
better
than
average
euro
beer
i
think
my
first
from
turkey
the
pour
is
clear
golden
pee
colored
with
a
lively
white
head
that
actually
has
pretty
good
retention
the
nose
is
extract
and
adjunct
like
a
crappy
lager
but
the
yeast
is
different
and
richer
some
potential
here
the
flavor
is
very
clean
and
crisp
neat
and
tidy
lacking
the
malt
profile
of
a
traditional
pilsener
this
is
more
of
an
adjunct
sort
of
malt
beer
but
there
is
some
decent
hopping
towards
the
finish
a
light
semisweet
fruitiness
and
an
easy
drinking
character
thats
enhanced
by
great
carbonation
and
quite
a
bit
more
body
than
most
of
these
have
i
would
have
preferred
a
beer
that
speaks
to
the
dynamic
turkish
culture
one
with
a
touch
of
east
and
west
flare
but
i
will
settle
for
a
better
than
average
euro
brew
not
bad
especially
when
ice
cold
as
far
as
the
taste
is
concerned
this
hits
the
style
pretty
well
not
overly
flavorful
but
it
is
crisp
and
quenching
maybe
a
touch
overcarbonated
which
affects
the
finish
somewhat
high
drinkability
here
much
higher
than
the
origin
or
packaging
would
have
you
believe
competitive
with
most
of
the
better
german
and
czech
examples
of
the
style
highlights
in
addition
to
the
musty
aroma
and
the
corn
and
cereal
malt
notes
include
the
sweetish
flavor
off
finish
and
just
allaround
moral
of
the
story
is
drink
something
else
of
this
beer
o
not
a
great
example
of
a
german
pils
but
passes
as
an
easy
drinking
euro
pale
lager
o
overall
i
did
not
think
this
was
a
great
beer
though
not
the
worst
smells
and
taste
slike
sweet
plum
wine
with
a
hint
of
skunkiness
in
the
taste
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
a
pretty
average
beer
overall
pretty
average
overall
rjt
poured
into
a
celebrator
pokal
not
absolutely
sure
this
is
the
efes
pilsner
it
came
in
a
squat
500
ml
bottle
that
only
says
efes
beer
the
abv
is
correct
and
it
appears
to
be
a
light
pilsner
type
adjunct
beer
pours
a
light
golden
amber
with
a
thin
white
head
that
dissipaters
quickly
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
light
aroma
of
biscuit
and
grassy
malt
hint
of
hops
and
corn
sweetness
taste
is
very
light
biscuit
malt
slightly
sweet
with
a
faint
wisp
of
hops
in
the
finish
no
off
flavors
but
very
attenuated
flavor
light
bodied
with
nice
carbonation
this
would
be
adequate
if
nothing
else
was
available
but
otherwise
a
typical
mass
produced
bland
commercial
beer
i
hope
i
can
try
something
a
little
more
exciting
from
turkey
next
time
an
unexciting
but
drinkable
beer
raw
grain
start
but
the
hop
bitterness
comes
quickly
and
strongly
surprisingly
flavorful
raw
grain
finish
with
a
good
peppery
bite
full
body
and
a
high
level
of
carbonation
o
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
this
beer
since
its
a
relatively
good
german
pilsener
from
turkey
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
this
beer
again
sometime
pours
a
pale
straw
colour
with
a
rather
generic
sweet
inoffensive
nose
the
beer
itself
is
surprisingly
flavourful
and
tangy
slightly
bubblegummy
with
enough
hop
strength
to
feel
like
a
proper
beer
not
outstanding
but
much
better
than
i
had
anticipated
overall
quite
a
good
standard
pilsener
doesnt
try
to
blow
its
trumpet
too
hard
just
a
good
quality
refreshing
beer
for
a
good
price
au43
a
case
in
2012
translucent
golden
yellow
with
good
carbonation
smell
is
musty
and
not
very
appealing
taste
starts
good
but
progresses
to
an
unpleasant
finish
has
insightful
corn
and
floral
hop
tastes
feels
average
in
the
mouth
but
the
taste
does
not
make
me
want
to
come
back
for
more
i
tried
this
beer
on
september
14
2010
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
beer
poured
a
translucent
pale
gold
colour
with
topns
of
effervescence
and
a
thin
white
head
which
quickly
dissipated
to
a
ring
the
aroma
was
corn
grain
and
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
weak
to
medium
bodied
with
a
medium
carbonation
the
flavour
was
acid
metal
grain
with
an
offputting
bitter
finish
i
tried
it
from
a
can
it
will
most
likely
taste
different
from
a
stubby
o
not
a
terrible
beer
but
not
particularly
memorable
either
o
just
a
run
of
the
mill
euro
lager
people
drink
it
like
crazy
here
in
istanbul
and
ill
probably
drink
a
few
more
while
im
here
as
its
really
hard
to
find
anything
else
this
is
a
decent
beer
lightly
malty
smooth
drinkable
but
ultimately
forgettable
taste
isnt
too
surprising
upfront
cereal
grains
are
certainly
present
its
somewhat
sweet
i
also
detect
a
bit
of
nuttiness
there
as
well
what
does
surprise
me
is
that
i
basically
get
no
hops
which
i
would
expect
to
taste
in
a
pils
thats
pretty
disappointing
just
another
average
euro
lager
as
it
is
i
suppose
worth
the
novelty
to
buy
because
its
turkish
and
you
dont
see
a
lot
of
beers
from
turkey
first
beer
i
loved
so
much
named
my
dog
after
it
poured
into
pilsner
glass
good
head
that
dissipated
quickly
skunkier
than
i
remember
it
being
when
i
first
had
it
years
ago
little
lacing
but
bubbly
effervescent
on
the
tongue
like
an
alka
seltzer
clean
finish
not
a
bad
beer
but
overall
average
a
pretty
good
job
by
a
country
not
known
for
beer
making
i
would
consider
getting
it
again
a
fairly
standard
lager
bland
and
uninteresting
rather
stale
perhaps
this
bottle
is
a
bit
old
probably
goes
down
well
in
hot
weather
but
i
cant
think
of
any
reason
to
chose
this
unless
there
is
no
alternative
o
a
pretty
poor
pilsener
in
my
view
so
drink
cold
the
aroma
was
weak
but
had
the
right
parts
to
it
with
a
clean
lager
yeast
and
honey
dipped
malt
aroma
that
also
translates
in
to
the
taste
but
the
taste
has
much
more
body
and
the
flavors
are
bright
and
quite
easy
to
place
i
really
enjoyed
the
sweeter
notes
not
as
dry
as
most
pilsners
and
not
overly
bubbly
either
it
was
overall
solid
and
very
drinkable
and
paired
well
with
the
lamb
and
rice
dish
i
had
a
nice
beer
overall
this
is
a
slightly
better
than
average
lager
id
get
it
again
orefreshingnice
lager
o
overall
would
drink
this
again
had
this
when
i
was
working
in
turkey
about
34
years
ago
and
like
it
very
much
great
to
see
it
in
the
us
very
refreshing
not
the
typical
pilsner
nothing
great
or
bad
just
average
overall
final
grade
3
16
a
c
overall
try
it
its
good
but
its
got
an
obvious
amount
of
adjunct
rice
in
it
as
it
says
right
on
the
label
its
reflected
in
the
taste
giving
it
something
the
others
perhaps
dont
have
in
the
overall
flavor
that
said
its
worth
trying
and
if
you
like
the
sweet
corn
taste
youll
like
it
and
go
back
for
another
im
sure
for
me
ill
try
another
but
never
make
a
night
out
of
this
beer
bottle
courtesy
of
my
friend
hammer
new
country
sampled
to
boot
pours
a
straw
yellow
fizzy
white
head
that
disappears
quickly
nose
is
neutral
taste
is
crackery
sweet
corn
balanced
by
grass
the
local
skunk
stops
to
say
hello
mouth
is
light
and
crisp
an
interesting
take
but
none
the
less
yellow
fizzy
crap
its
very
rare
i
meet
a
beer
i
wont
finish
although
i
still
hope
to
try
this
again
one
day
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
anadolu
efes
brewery
produce
this
beer
in
for
3
regions
turkish
local
market
russia
and
europe
main
problem
is
they
use
glucose
syrup
made
from
corn
and
rice
on
the
turkish
version
this
makes
efes
pilsener
is
not
an
officially
a
beer
its
just
something
else
but
they
cannot
use
that
formula
for
their
russian
nor
european
products
overall
this
is
actually
a
really
nice
beer
i
was
blinded
by
the
stereotype
of
the
classic
national
mass
produced
lager
but
i
was
extremely
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
not
the
greatest
beer
ever
but
its
very
nice
to
drink
high
marks
for
the
style
o
a
standard
german
pilsener
nothing
more
nothing
less
im
pleased
to
say
how
surprised
i
am
by
this
beer
who
would
have
known
turkey
could
produce
such
a
solid
pilsener
overall
not
bad
one
of
the
better
pilseners
ive
had
in
this
country
o
a
decent
choice
on
a
thirsty
day
in
the
sun
and
i
can
imagine
having
efes
with
salads
pasta
dishes
grilled
pork
or
dare
i
say
turkey
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
1
inch
puffy
white
head
that
settles
to
a
thin
film
nice
distinct
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
breadbiscuit
honey
tea
and
some
prune
aromas
taste
is
very
breadybiscuitlike
with
a
distinct
tea
and
tannin
flavor
mild
bitterness
on
the
palate
after
each
sip
a
pretty
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
medium
bodied
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
pilsener
from
turkey
until
i
joined
ba
i
didnt
even
know
they
had
beer
from
turkey
good
stuff
trying
a
beer
from
turkey
that
i
have
heard
was
decent
and
its
not
bad
the
labeled
is
a
pilsner
but
it
can
be
thought
of
as
an
american
adjuct
ale
as
well
sort
of
along
the
same
family
i
suppose
pours
a
nice
head
that
doesnt
last
too
long
color
was
clear
and
golden
smell
some
malt
and
hops
not
too
complex
the
taste
is
light
with
spice
and
malt
flavors
and
a
bit
of
hops
after
taste
the
mouth
feel
is
fuller
then
you
might
expect
i
cant
call
this
an
outstanding
beer
but
it
is
good
enough
to
have
again
overal
this
is
a
good
lager
for
the
summer
i
would
drink
this
again
and
i
will
try
to
find
this
when
i
go
to
italy
this
summer
medium
light
body
d
decently
drinkable
but
this
really
isnt
much
of
a
pilsner
it
was
good
for
the
experience
but
certainly
not
a
go
to
beer
overall
i
really
wasnt
expecting
much
here
but
i
ended
up
being
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
surely
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
had
from
the
lcbo
im
going
to
pick
up
a
few
more
of
these
to
keep
for
the
summer
incase
it
disappears
from
the
lcbo
shelves
it
will
be
perfect
for
the
warmer
summer
months
d
surprised
me
nice
german
pilsenser
this
is
good
but
not
exceptional
if
you
get
a
chance
to
try
a
beer
from
turkey
this
is
a
fine
one
to
sample
great
summerimport
brew
to
sip
on
turkey
is
where
so
many
of
the
worlds
cultures
both
past
and
present
collide
into
one
another
somehow
however
they
missed
hitting
the
beer
it
is
ironic
that
a
place
so
rich
in
cultural
heritage
one
that
stretches
across
two
continents
and
is
bordered
by
eight
distinct
countries
should
have
such
a
characterless
uninteresting
national
brand
but
its
really
not
all
that
surprising
efes
is
a
reflection
not
of
its
country
but
of
its
market
i
had
this
beer
with
a
iskander
doener
kebab
and
this
was
a
great
match
dvery
drinkable
something
you
could
offer
guests
and
they
wouldnt
mind
it
at
all
pretty
good
pilsener
nothing
more
but
nothing
less
not
impressive
but
drinkable
given
the
options
in
turkey
this
will
have
to
do
pilsners
are
a
tricky
brew
for
me
to
review
especially
massmarket
ones
because
they
really
seem
to
taste
identical
to
one
another
hard
to
praise
oh
so
easy
to
slam
in
this
case
however
i
found
efes
pilsner
to
be
a
very
drinkable
little
brew
something
i
would
gladly
have
several
of
in
a
single
session
while
it
may
be
a
bit
sweet
and
lacking
in
a
bold
hop
presence
there
still
isnt
much
wrong
with
it
which
for
a
cheaper
import
brew
i
have
to
give
credit
if
you
just
want
a
goodtasting
brew
from
country
you
wouldnt
normally
associate
with
beer
and
to
knock
another
country
off
your
list
turkeys
efes
is
certainly
a
fine
way
to
go
taste
is
all
carbon
dioxide
and
no
hop
or
any
beer
like
characteristics
at
all
weak
extremely
watery
and
wet
like
a
typical
macro
chemicaly
laced
to
death
finish
disapates
and
disappears
instantly
leaving
you
gaseous
after
having
one
that
was
all
i
ever
wanted
really
not
that
great
but
i
know
ive
had
worse
pretty
good
for
a
turkish
pilsener
drinkability
if
drunk
cold
on
a
hot
day
an
efes
pilsner
would
go
down
pretty
well
certainly
a
lot
better
than
most
macrolagers
available
in
south
africa
also
reviewed
on
my
blog
httpabarwithnoname
wordpress
com
nothing
interesting
but
certainly
not
a
terrible
offering
and
hey
its
from
turkey
how
often
do
you
see
that
here
d
standard
fare
nothing
to
write
home
about
and
drinkable
brew
drinkability
i
could
down
another
at
this
price
but
would
i
really
want
to
i
will
say
that
this
beer
tries
to
do
some
interesting
things
and
id
have
no
hesitation
to
reach
for
efes
other
offerings
on
that
basis
but
this
beer
isnt
built
like
a
pilsener
needs
to
be
drinkability
is
decent
with
crisp
lager
and
dry
with
no
sticky
finish
pretty
sessionable
pours
a
clear
yellow
colour
that
starts
with
thick
white
head
but
it
dissipates
fairly
quickly
without
any
lacing
smells
of
sweet
grainy
malt
and
faint
grassy
hops
flavour
is
pretty
small
but
pleasant
enough
nice
carbonation
level
and
easy
to
drink
drinkability
is
low
hard
to
find
better
things
are
cheaper
and
easier
to
find
but
it
was
kinda
boring
and
even
with
the
good
setup
it
did
not
shine
not
a
beer
i
would
pursue
but
not
one
that
id
send
back
either
the
crack
n
glug
only
resulted
in
a
foamy
bonewhite
head
that
hung
around
as
long
as
my
last
girlfriend
who
bolted
as
soon
as
i
suggested
something
not
on
the
menu
hey
baby
its
only
kinky
the
first
time
where
ya
goin
awww
color
was
one
yellow
step
above
water
or
a
near
cousin
to
urine
pale
like
casper
the
ghost
nose
was
about
right
for
the
style
with
an
initial
malty
sweetness
underlain
by
the
noble
hops
hmmm
mouthfeel
was
thin
and
watery
but
the
taste
was
not
unpleasant
which
was
what
i
was
girding
myself
against
instead
it
was
an
oddly
light
malty
flavor
semisweet
but
very
light
in
its
execution
finish
was
likewise
light
unobtrusive
even
ethereal
how
can
i
hate
on
something
that
was
barely
there
this
was
like
maj
majors
description
of
chocolatecovered
cotton
balls
light
fluffy
etheral
you
would
hardly
know
that
you
were
drinking
it
hoo
pale
yellow
no
cap
to
speak
of
aroma
of
wet
cardboard
tastes
sweet
uneventful
flat
with
all
the
insipid
dextrin
sub
compounds
total
extract
beer
brought
up
to
gravity
with
dextrin
syrups
complete
shite
quite
possibly
the
worst
pilsner
i
ever
tasted
certainly
one
of
the
worst
beers
i
ever
tasted
drinkability
although
i
dont
have
anything
against
the
taste
of
this
beer
it
just
tastes
like
a
nasty
hangover
waiting
to
happen
drinkability
is
just
soso
its
not
awful
but
its
not
very
good
forget
this
beer
if
you
want
to
drink
something
special
overall
while
it
was
fun
to
try
a
turkish
beer
this
didnt
really
do
much
for
me
good
only
in
the
heat
d
great
crisp
and
sweet
lager
to
relax
to
didnt
know
what
to
expect
from
a
turkish
beer
but
this
ones
not
bad
at
all
no
alcohol
taste
and
it
goes
down
easy
i
would
have
had
another
had
they
not
been
charging
7
a
bottle
for
it
d
it
could
work
on
a
summer
day
but
if
you
can
find
a
good
urquell
or
czech
budweiser
budvar
this
could
be
a
good
reason
to
not
buying
this
one
you
could
drink
this
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it
but
even
for
a
cheap
eurolager
this
is
not
the
beer
that
made
novi
sad
famous
label
doesnt
actually
say
it
is
made
at
the
serbian
brewery
and
lists
anadolu
efes
brewery
istanbul
turska
as
well
the
taliban
strikes
again
lackluster
beer
overall
with
a
taste
that
is
mildly
unpleasant
not
very
drinkable
cheers
d
well
i
have
to
admit
i
bought
this
just
out
of
joking
curiosity
from
a
wonderful
kebab
stand
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
is
surprisingly
drinkable
i
enjoy
this
more
than
i
imagined
i
would
mostly
because
the
pilzner
hops
are
cut
back
and
other
flavors
of
the
corn
barley
and
local
water
come
out
i
doubt
ill
drink
this
one
again
its
nothing
special
dont
go
looking
for
it
d
this
goes
down
very
quickly
and
with
little
fuss
because
there
is
so
little
to
savor
however
ive
had
this
on
tap
and
in
bottles
before
and
it
was
quite
a
bit
better
perhaps
this
particular
bottle
was
just
a
bit
too
close
to
its
sellby
date
i
was
really
pleased
with
this
and
im
sure
ill
get
it
again
a
bit
of
on
the
sweet
side
but
it
is
great
just
having
a
pilsner
without
any
skunk
a
decent
beer
for
a
warm
day
could
go
with
a
standard
hamburger
but
isnt
this
really
an
adjunct
lager
im
not
reaching
for
this
one
over
a
prima
but
im
not
downright
rejecting
it
either
id
have
no
problem
trying
this
one
again
or
having
a
few
in
a
session
this
might
be
a
turkish
made
beer
found
at
the
lcbo
bit
efes
in
another
language
means
nothing
and
that
is
the
extent
of
it
pale
yellow
lager
with
some
white
foam
cheesy
aroma
light
almost
astringent
mouthfeel
not
very
drinkable
but
not
the
most
horrible
beer
i
have
ever
tried
d
pretty
easy
drinking
manageable
abv
flavors
are
are
just
a
bit
in
your
face
to
consider
this
a
long
session
beer
this
is
a
decent
beer
with
a
mediocre
head
that
is
quickly
reduced
to
the
top
of
the
beer
very
drinkable
and
light
this
beer
is
a
good
start
for
turkish
beer
nothing
fantastic
but
a
decent
beer
to
serve
for
something
different
i
suggest
to
serve
this
chilled
and
paired
with
spicy
food
this
is
a
good
beer
to
have
around
when
you
want
to
impress
your
cobeer
lovers
of
something
new
is
a
must
have
and
must
try
pilsener
nope
is
it
a
bad
pilsener
nope
its
one
of
those
beers
in
case
you
ever
want
to
try
a
beer
from
a
country
that
you
dont
usually
see
a
lot
beers
come
from
if
you
want
to
do
that
then
yeah
pop
open
an
efes
its
not
going
to
cost
you
much
poured
a
clear
yellow
with
a
modest
head
that
rapidly
reduced
to
a
collar
the
aroma
was
free
of
the
skunky
smell
i
associate
with
a
lot
of
lagerpilseners
but
had
little
else
going
for
it
the
taste
was
malty
sweet
with
a
light
lemony
taste
at
the
back
of
the
throat
the
feel
was
light
bodied
with
adequate
carbonation
drinkability
was
good
the
light
lemon
flavor
i
perceive
sets
efes
a
little
apart
from
its
counterparts
in
style
overall
there
is
worse
beers
out
there
there
most
definitely
is
but
its
got
nothing
that
makes
me
believe
id
buy
it
again
a
drinkable
brew
this
beer
is
thirstquenching
and
decently
tasty
had
this
at
pasha
in
arlington
ma
marvelous
food
on
a
menu
that
featured
bud
miller
coors
etc
this
was
about
the
best
beer
i
could
find
but
thats
speaking
relatively
thin
watery
aromaless
and
one
step
sideways
from
the
average
indian
lager
feh
better
than
water
but
not
by
much
stick
with
pashas
excellent
turkish
coffee
a
less
than
adequate
older
world
pilsener
the
lack
of
clean
crispiness
here
being
the
utmost
dead
giveaway
add
in
some
pithy
cheap
graininess
and
the
deal
is
undone
maybe
somewhat
agreeable
if
it
was
icecold
and
you
are
sweating
under
the
mediterranean
sun
but
otherwise
not
worth
any
serious
pilsener
fans
time
drinkability
as
a
tasty
pilsner
i
could
drink
this
stuff
like
water
not
something
that
would
stand
on
its
own
in
the
eyes
of
a
discerning
beer
drinker
but
something
that
would
go
well
with
meat
on
the
go
taste
maltier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
definitely
a
good
and
enjoyable
pils
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
fairly
decent
sized
white
head
that
is
a
couple
inches
to
start
and
sticks
around
a
bit
before
fading
to
a
thick
ring
smells
light
somewhat
grainy
quite
soft
the
taste
is
also
soft
somewhat
grainy
a
little
nutty
not
bad
but
on
the
very
soft
side
for
a
german
pilsner
and
without
the
flavor
profile
of
a
softer
czech
pilsner
still
noticeable
pilsner
taste
unlike
a
vapid
eurolager
the
mouthfeel
is
also
soft
rather
than
crisp
but
with
a
light
bitterness
in
the
finish
nott
terrible
d
cant
deny
that
this
pilsner
has
a
thirst
quenching
quality
that
i
find
is
common
to
german
pilsner
however
i
dont
think
the
turkish
have
quite
nailed
the
taste
and
feel
that
you
get
from
the
german
brewed
pilsners
poured
from
a
brown
bottle
into
a
weizen
glass
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
has
a
mild
grainy
smell
taste
is
crisp
somewhat
hoppy
slight
bitter
finish
decent
in
the
mouth
and
very
drinkable
overall
this
makes
for
a
pretty
good
brew
d
well
since
there
is
nothing
else
i
keep
drinking
them
it
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
though
but
the
mouthfeel
is
full
but
light
which
is
refreshing
and
it
washes
down
turkish
food
nicely
i
cant
complain
too
much
d
not
sorry
i
tried
it
but
wont
be
picking
it
up
again
pretty
easy
to
drink
though
honey
hued
apperance
and
cloudy
no
lace
or
head
and
an
abesence
of
bubbles
the
smell
is
yeasty
and
pungent
alchol
aroma
the
taste
is
delicious
very
mellow
taste
of
vanilla
and
syrupy
nectars
suprisingly
tingly
even
though
there
was
the
absence
of
carbonation
in
the
apperance
tingled
the
entire
mouth
especialy
the
tip
of
the
tounge
mouth
feel
was
a
strongpoint
upon
the
first
sip
my
mouth
was
so
overjoyed
that
i
wanted
more
and
more
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
are
both
average
not
a
bad
beer
considering
its
a
germanstyle
pilsner
from
turkey
its
not
tremendous
but
it
is
decent
crystal
clear
honey
yellow
with
a
fluffy
finger
of
foam
that
leaves
fine
lace
behind
smells
of
noble
hops
toasted
grain
and
a
whiff
of
lemon
tastes
mildly
hop
forward
and
grainy
finishes
squeaky
clean
this
beer
is
crisp
and
light
bodied
nothing
special
here
a
good
lawnmower
beer
pours
light
golden
with
a
one
finger
white
head
decent
retention
and
laceing
aroma
is
sweet
and
grassy
body
is
light
and
carbonated
taste
is
of
bread
and
butter
up
front
sweetbut
with
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
in
the
finish
the
turks
can
brew
some
beer
d
pretty
good
overall
a
fairly
solid
euro
light
lager
this
is
quite
smooth
but
maybe
a
touch
too
sweet
for
me
d
meh
its
a
pretty
average
german
pilsener
i
dont
see
myself
looking
for
this
one
again
d
not
great
not
great
at
all
i
was
worried
what
a
beer
from
turkey
would
taste
like
and
it
looks
like
my
fears
were
justified
it
is
very
drinkable
and
smooth
but
not
tasty
d
sessionable
in
the
same
way
bud
light
is
had
at
cafe
istanbul
at
shops
at
legacy
in
plano
served
in
a
glass
from
a
bottle
so
missed
the
initial
head
and
aroma
it
was
a
clear
light
yellow
in
color
with
some
carbonation
and
light
lacing
it
had
the
typical
pilsener
aroma
but
not
quite
as
strong
which
was
good
for
me
as
i
tend
to
not
like
the
overly
skunked
ones
the
taste
was
good
not
as
bitter
as
most
overall
a
good
middle
of
the
road
beer
wouldnt
ever
buy
a
sixer
of
it
but
would
have
again
at
the
restaurant
the
taste
is
like
the
taste
from
the
bottle
or
can
but
cleaner
freshr
more
aromatic
with
clean
strong
grain
taste
throughout
hints
of
apple
and
herbs
a
light
herbal
hop
bitterness
to
balance
out
the
light
sweetness
and
give
a
crisp
clean
finish
easily
drinkable
pours
a
yellow
clear
colored
body
with
a
huge
brightwhite
head
with
big
bubbles
effervescent
malty
aroma
watery
taste
with
a
malt
taste
acidic
aftertaste
very
watery
witn
little
flavor
tastes
like
flavored
fizzy
malt
water
not
good
this
actually
tasted
close
to
a
euro
pilsner
crisp
and
carbonated
with
a
nice
bitterness
to
it
i
wasnt
in
love
with
the
aftertaste
not
a
great
pilsner
but
better
than
you
might
expect
d
very
refreshing
would
be
a
great
summer
day
beer
low
abv
very
drinkable
however
i
didnt
hate
it
and
can
imagine
drinking
it
in
the
summer
but
given
my
other
choices
i
doubt
i
would
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
filling
at
all
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
not
one
of
the
better
that
ive
had
in
the
style
but
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
viable
option
if
i
didnt
have
much
to
choose
from
d
not
a
bed
effort
i
feared
it
would
not
be
so
good
but
it
actually
had
a
good
flavor
and
no
skunkiness
i
had
this
in
a
snifter
while
at
a
club
in
istanbul
the
color
is
amber
with
a
very
thin
head
which
is
not
at
all
how
a
german
pilsener
should
appear
this
beer
doesnt
have
much
of
a
smell
and
it
goes
down
very
smooth
without
leaving
any
negative
aftertastes
in
your
mouth
i
actually
thought
it
was
closer
to
a
lager
than
a
pilsener
in
taste
for
a
country
and
region
that
is
not
known
for
producing
much
beer
efes
stands
out
drinkability
you
could
make
a
night
of
this
sessionable
both
in
abv
and
taste
light
enough
to
consume
in
large
amounts
but
tasty
enough
to
make
you
want
to
this
is
a
beer
i
would
see
a
lot
while
i
was
in
germany
and
it
is
well
suited
to
turkish
food
it
honestly
is
not
a
bad
beer
taste
is
a
little
bit
different
but
not
bad
it
has
a
transparent
yellow
body
with
tiny
bubbles
in
it
the
head
and
lace
are
both
very
nice
the
head
is
just
right
and
lace
is
not
frothy
it
is
thin
and
stays
on
the
side
of
the
glass
the
whole
way
down
it
smells
of
sour
fruit
and
grass
the
taste
is
straw
like
and
earthy
with
the
same
little
bit
of
sour
fruit
there
is
a
gentle
sweet
and
bitter
blend
as
you
start
to
drink
more
it
has
a
light
body
that
goes
so
well
with
a
donner
kebab
bottle
thanks
to
mmmbeer
pours
a
crystal
clear
golden
color
with
a
medium
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grasses
some
sweet
malts
honey
and
some
floral
hops
a
very
clean
flavor
oddly
though
i
can
detect
a
good
bit
of
alcohol
crisp
malts
some
apples
and
floral
hops
a
fairly
dry
finish
somewhat
fruity
and
a
decent
flavor
not
bad
it
was
an
early
evening
and
looking
over
my
choices
i
remembered
the
beer
guy
saying
that
this
efes
pils
would
be
the
best
beer
i
ever
tried
he
was
ultimately
wrong
on
that
suggestion
but
did
get
it
right
that
i
would
enjoy
this
pils
and
be
able
to
fully
appreciate
its
pure
golden
color
with
a
very
thin
but
active
head
lots
of
carbonation
were
dancing
in
the
golden
liquid
to
fuel
this
head
i
bet
each
little
bubble
has
a
great
story
to
tell
about
its
short
existence
the
smell
is
a
little
boring
in
that
its
a
floral
scent
is
plain
the
taste
is
not
all
that
hoppy
but
does
support
the
scent
in
bringing
to
life
a
small
piney
taste
the
lack
of
bitterness
really
makes
this
pils
an
enjoyable
beer
well
that
and
the
light
body
that
the
liquid
presents
enjoy
this
one
because
it
will
be
gone

a
good
but
not
great
beer
would
go
well
with
most
foods
especially
spicy
ones
pretty
solid
pilsner
from
a
country
that
isnt
well
known
for
beer
about
as
i
remember
it
sweet
and
grassy
nope
not
as
good
as
the
german
beers
we
got
there
but
better
than
budweiser
thanks
to
thirstybird
for
bringing
this
back
from
turkey
appearance
was
bright
translucent
yellow
head
with
white
and
fleeting
nose
was
light
grain
and
corn
taste
was
basically
the
same
as
a
nondescript
macrolager
also
picked
up
wet
cardboard
and
wheat
mouthfeel
was
light
and
lively
easy
drinking
with
a
clean
finish
overall
it
is
easily
drinkable
i
drank
a
bunch
of
it
when
i
was
recently
in
istanbul
but
not
a
great
beer
by
any
means
d
overall
decent
drinkability
for
this
style
considering
its
from
turkey
as
well
overall
this
was
pretty
average
but
certainly
not
the
worst
attempt
at
the
style
reminded
me
more
of
a
euro
lager
than
a
pilsner
i
would
have
it
again
if
i
were
visiting
turkey
and
there
were
few
other
options
well
to
give
this
beer
some
credit
i
drank
at
a
much
warmer
temperature
than
i
should
have
pale
golden
color
with
an
unusual
smell
i
couldnt
put
my
finger
on
exactly
what
i
was
smelling
but
i
didnt
really
like
it
taste
was
blah
watered
down
and
unexceptional
very
drinkable
but
why
bother
cant
say
that
i
would
give
this
beer
another
try
maybe
if
i
was
burning
up
at
a
disco
and
it
was
ice
cold
i
could
handle
it
definitely
not
something
i
would
keep
around
the
house
prost
drinkability
mediumhigh
especially
on
a
hot
humid
afternoon
drinkability
eh
not
quite
a
turkey
from
turkey
its
just
a
basic
simple
lager
a
refreshing
pilsner
that
goes
down
easy
and
would
be
a
good
session
beer
also
a
good
beer
for
coming
in
after
a
hard
days
work
given
the
macrolager
appearance
the
beer
boasts
a
surprisingly
substantial
presence
in
the
mouth
loaded
with
light
malts
and
grassy
earthy
hops
somewhat
sweet
with
a
solid
bitter
finish
very
drinkable
d
a
worse
pilsener
than
some
american
macros
in
my
humble
opinion
bottle
at
turkish
cuisine
nyc
i
didnt
feel
like
this
was
a
pale
lager
had
more
of
a
pilsener
taste
to
it
in
my
opinion
reminiscent
of
urquell
in
that
it
was
a
bit
buttery
but
less
bitter
also
kind
of
fruity
with
something
i
couldnt
quite
grasp
quite
good
in
my
opinion
this
one
was
fairly
nuts
not
what
i
expected
at
all
appearance
is
standard
but
nose
right
off
the
bat
is
all
over
the
place
huge
fruit
flavor
a
candylike
sweetness
that
wouldnt
have
been
out
of
place
in
a
bock
taste
is
likewise
cotton
candy
grapes
oranges
honey
no
real
hop
character
to
this
one
which
was
unfortunate
because
there
wasnt
really
much
else
going
on
besides
the
sweet
feel
was
mediocre
no
complaints
about
the
carbonation
overall
a
better
beer
than
expected
although
nothing
too
exciting
d
please
pace
a
small
cooler
on
the
bar
full
of
ice
and
a
twelve
pack
of
these
also
place
friends
at
bar
with
there
own
12
pack
equipped
coolers
and
then
add
belly
dancers
and
bbq
lamb
kebabs
yes
drinkability
is
good
dthis
is
drinkable
and
is
not
too
offensive
so
in
that
i
suppose
it
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
to
me
this
tasted
like
a
typical
run
of
the
mill
american
macro
lager
and
tastes
like
it
has
fillers
in
itnot
positive
either
way
the
sample
could
have
been
old
from
the
long
voyage
from
istanbul
so
i
might
give
it
another
shot
if
i
were
in
turkey
dif
you
enjoy
other
euros
pilswhich
i
dogive
this
one
a
shotits
nothing
to
get
excited
aboutbut
its
a
whole
lot
tastier
than
your
average
macro
brews
drinkability
an
average
beer
in
the
style
german
pilsener
on
the
palate
crisp
carbonated
dry
and
refreshing
the
flavor
was
quite
a
surprisewhere
i
expected
a
typical
euromacrolager
there
was
a
real
foral
and
citrus
hoppy
aroma
and
flavor
married
to
the
refreshing
dry
malt
it
actually
is
a
pilsener
and
a
pretty
good
one
nice
warning
2
i
like
darker
beers
that
often
taste
different
or
even
better
warmed
up
a
bit
dont
drink
this
one
warm
the
skunk
really
comes
up
the
mouthfeel
goes
flat
the
taste
becomes
asprin
bitter
and
the
finish
is
rank
duh
well
im
used
to
being
able
to
drink
a
beer
throughout
the
temperature
ranges
not
this
one
ice
cold
it
is
at
least
refreshing
keep
it
that
way
beer
from
turkey
i
was
some
what
skepticle
at
first
i
mean
they
are
a
majority
islamic
country
and
alcohol
is
a
no
no
right
however
after
seeing
all
the
turkish
bars
in
munich
i
thought
i
would
try
this
out
crystal
clear
ultra
pale
yellow
beer
with
a
small
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
very
grainy
too
much
so
for
my
taste
and
a
little
off
putting
taste
is
ok
a
little
watery
and
not
much
hop
flavor
but
easy
drinking
and
an
average
beer
much
better
than
a
bud
or
miller
lite
overall
the
beer
is
pretty
mediocre
worth
a
try
if
you
are
curious
but
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
it
again
if
you
are
in
istanbul
drinkability
you
can
drink
this
like
water
drinking
this
on
a
beach
sounds
like
heaven
pours
a
very
light
golden
color
without
alot
of
carbonation
smell
is
incredibly
skunky
almost
overpowering
taste
is
sub
par
very
skunky
taste
to
it
my
own
mother

overall
very

i
wanted
to
like
this
beer

it
is

a

certainly
worth

not
your

europils
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
had
this
beer
so
my
memory
is
going
to
have
to
do
i
first
had
it
in
marmaris
turkey
it
was
a
great
beer
the
color
was
a
rich
gold
the
head
formed
nicely
and
dissipated
slowly
very
very
drinkable
as
it
warms
up
the
flavor
is
very
full
its
a
beer
that
you
can
drink
in
a
large
quantity
and
still
want
more
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
drinkability
pretty
darn
good
for
a
beer
made
in
a
muslim
country
overall
this
is
an
excellent
pilsner
its
light
and
refreshing
and
great
with
just
about
any
food
it
reminds
me
of
a
cross
between
a
czech
and
german
pils
because
it
seems
a
bit
malty
for
a
german
pils
but
a
bit
hoppy
for
a
czech
the
beer
pours
a
straw
yellow
body
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
present
atop
the
beer
sits
a
nice
looking
white
head
that
left
little
lacing
the
aroma
was
slightly
of
floral
hops
with
a
sweet
juicy
fruit
malt
aroma
the
taste
follows
suit
closely
however
there
was
an
off
taste
in
it
that
made
it
close
to
un
palatable
i
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
it
was
like
something
i
have
never
encountered
before
the
body
was
light
with
a
semidry
finish
this
beer
left
me
not
wanting
another
one
at
all
an
average
beer
at
best
familiar
look
and
flavor
if
youve
had
one
of
the
many
similar
styles
from
the
baltic
or
eastern
europe
looks
and
smells
in
the
glass
like
a
sparkling
cider
bright
yellow
thin
bubbly
taste
is
very
subtle
malt
and
hops
with
a
spritzy
carbonation
slightly
watereddown
taste
and
a
bit
of
metallic
aftertaste
that
would
probably
be
less
pronounced
if
fresh
from
the
keg
a
eurasian
macro
but
much
cleaner
taste
than
american
macro
pilsners
definitely
a
drinkable
beer
and
one
that
would
go
great
with
local
fare
in
istanbul
or
constantinople
or
is
it
istanbul
pours
a
very
clear
golden
straw
color
with
a
flimsy
white
head
smells
faintly
of
hops
and
pilsener
malt
not
a
whole
lot
of
aroma
here
flavor
is
similar
watery
at
first
then
a
brief
appearance
of
hops
and
then
a
blast
of
sweet
malt
smooth
mouthfeel
with
super
tiny
bubbles
scrubs
the
palate
clean
not
much
going
on
here
definitely
drinkable

with

even
pouring
into
the
middle
of

smells
mostly
of
citrusy
and
a
tiny
bit
of
floral

tastes
very

hardly
any
sweetness
of
any
kind
not
really
very
bitter
either
not
really
much
in
the
way
of
taste
at
all
but
very
clean
mouthfeel
is
very
watery
but
otherwise
not
too
bad
overall
its
fairly
drinkable
because
theres
no
real
flavor
to
disagree
with
wouldnt
be
too
bad
on
a
hot
day
i
guess
overall
impression
a
fair
pils
not
my
favorite
style
in
the
world
but
this
is
well
brewed
and
id
drink
a
number
of
them
on
a
hot
day
a
very
low
pedestal
as
a
solid
example
of
the
pilsener
style
especially
given
its
point
of
origin
body
is
light
and
alcohol
is
lowtoaverage
so
once
the
sweetness
has
mellowed
on
the
palate
the
hop
bitterness
remains
with
you
and
in
a
semidry
pleasant
manner
i
first
really
enjoyed
this
with
a
turkish
friend
in
a
small
kitchen
during
a
crowded
party
in
an
apartment
with
no
air
conditioning
all
during
a
scorching
summer
in
minnesota
that
means
100f
degrees
hes
an
mgd
drinker
but
really
appreciated
being
able
to
drink
hometown
brew
hes
from
istanbul
and
in
the
abovementioned
conditions
he
said
the
beer
felt
right
at
home
a
good
beer
that
i
will
pay
good
money
for
but
there
are
plenty
of
german
and
bohemian
pils
e
g
bitburger
that
i
prefer
a
pretty
dull
and
lifeless
lager
a
tad
light
in
the
hop
department
for
a
true
pilsner
but
overall
a
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
brew
perhaps
this
would
be
better
freshno
way
of
telling
how
old
this
bottle
is
pilsners
from
the
med
dont
have
great
flavours
or
strong
aftertastes
this
one
almost
does
have
those
qualities
but
not
quiet
d
worth
the
try
but
mainly
for
the
novelty
i
probably
would
not
buy
one
ever
again
unless
perhaps
if
i
was
in
turkey
just
too
bland
and
brings
so
little
to
the
table
especially
when
there
are
so
many
other
flavorful
beers
out
there
carbonation
is
okay
but
the
flavour
of
this
is
so
watery
and
harsh
that
its
hard
to
drink
mouthfeel
was
thin
to
moderate
somewaht
watery
ill
drink
this
one
if
i
get
to
turkey
but
probably
not
before
then
very
clear
yellow
and
highly
corbonated
thick
head
apon
the
pour
and
some
lace
was
present
on
the
beer
glass
after
the
tasting
sweet
and
slighty
malty
in
flavor
very
lighty
hopped
the
body
was
thin
i
woulnt
order
this
beer
at
a
bar
but
would
drink
it
if
it
were
the
only
one
offered
i
had
forgotten
that
id
reviewed
this
beer
some
time
ago
only
realizing
after
id
nearly
finished
this
review
i
suppose
i
can
look
at
it
as
an
evolution
in
my
tastes
and
palate
this
pilsener
poured
clear
gold
with
a
soapy
white
head
of
half
an
inch
the
pilsner
glass
was
coated
with
fat
bubbles
that
rose
quickly
the
aroma
is
of
bready
and
honeyish
malt
some
green
and
grassyhay
and
herbal
like
hop
and
fresh
grains
the
taste
is
pleasantly
malty
nice
focus
on
fresh
grains
slight
straw
grassy
hop
and
slightest
bit
of
pepper
in
the
dryer
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
fairly
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
a
very
pleasant
and
drinkable
pilsener
brewed
in
the
german
style
nice
grain
flavors
a
middleoftheroad
german
pilsner
i
hate
to
greet
a
new
beer
with
preconceived
notions
but
i
didnt
really
expect
a
turkish
brewer
to
nail
the
german
pilsener
style
efes
pilsener
is
a
barely
respectable
effort
that
might
suffice
if
drunk
fresh
in
an
ankara
beer
bar
but
it
leaves
a
lot
to
be
desired
at
this
particular
time
and
in
this
particular
place
give
this
one
a
pass
d
this
doesnt
taste
like
budweiser
so
leave
that
bias
behind
when
you
try
it
for
the
first
time
its
not
a
pilsner
urquell
either
but
thats
not
a
bad
thing
its
better
with
food
as
the
clean
finish
doesnt
overwrite
whatever
you
just
took
a
bite
of
but
the
sweetness
of
the
beer
complements
the
bite
pretty
well
goes
great
with
light
spicy
food
like
potato
and
chick
pea
kofte
or
a
turkish
pilaf
with
dried
fruit
in
it
do
i
ever
crave
efes
no
but
if
im
in
a
turkish
restaurant
im
glad
its
on
the
menu
its
solid
not
spectacular
but
solid
this
is
what
it
is
a
turkish
macro
that
phrase
sums
up
all
of
the
problems
with
this
beer
and
should
keep
expectations
low
it
basicall
looked
like
budweiser
and
tasted
like
a
watered
down
heineken
except
with
a
metallic
aftertaste
not
really
worth
drinking
for
any
reason
other
than
to
say
that
youve
had
a
beer
from
turkey
pours
a
golden
hay
with
some
par
bubbling
crisp
aroma
of
carbonation
and
pale
malts
but
still
adjuncty
in
both
aroma
and
taste
lots
of
grassy
malts
in
the
mouth
mixed
well
with
lots
of
carbonation
in
the
palate
a
little
dry
at
times
but
pretty
easy
to
drink
perfect
for
a
baseball
game
overall
nothing
especially
good
nothing
especially
bad
a
mediocre
brew
boredom
efes
pisener

with

from

no
off
smells
fairly
light
but
a
nice
kiss
of
hops
near
the
finish
im
not
offended
which
is
better
than
i
expected
easy
to
drink
this
would
probably
be
a
decent
session
beer
worth
a
try
definite
improvement
on
bmc
for
sure
especailly
refreshing
while
trying
to
beat
the
heat
with
no
ac
the
good
thing
about
this
beer
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
critisize
whats
wrong
with
the
beer
is
that
there
is
nothing
really
outstanding
about
the
brew
its
a
simple
pilsner
malt
brew
with
eurohops
which
contribute
an
earthy
dirty
flavor
and
character
the
malt
profile
yet
simple
is
solid
and
firm
yeilding
a
creamy
bready
yeasty
character
that
is
uninhibited
by
much
offflavoring
yea
it
has
a
grain
flavor
but
it
is
mild
subdued
and
masked
by
a
pleasant
creaminess
finishes
mildly
crisp
and
lightjust
slight

a
good

mouthfeel

the
beer

the
beer

who
would
have
thought
a
beer
from
turkey
would
be
so
nice
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
and
with
some
additional
improvement
it
can
become
a
really
good
one

medium

aromas

sour

light

taste
was
rather
bland
and
unexciting
light
hops
and
grass
mix
with
sweet
grain
and
a
slightly
dry
malt
mouthfeel
was
kind
of
watery
and
a
touch
flat
drinkability
borders
on
average
better
examples
of
the
style
are
readily
available
this
is
not
horrible
but
its
not
good
either
its
better
than
bud
but
not
by
much
the
nose
is
boring
but
not
offensive
taste
is
decidedly
bready
and
toasty
grainy
and
cheeriolike
weird
mouthfeel
is
odd
and
a
bit
watery
but
enough
bubbles
to
not
drain
the
score
too
much
meh
good
but
not
great
bad
but
not
horrible
okay
more
carbonation
would
make
this
more
refreshing
this
wasnt
what
i
was
hoping
for
but
its
pretty
interesting
plenty
drinkable
i
could
happily
drink
this
with
fish
or
a
burger
or
after
a
round
of
golf
all
in
all
this
is
a
nice
beer
and
it
is
growing
on
me
the
more
i
drink
it
i
still
find
it
messy
but
even
in
its
disorganized
fashion
i
dont
mind
it
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
council
bluffs
ia
try
one
disappointing
at
best
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
that
falls
quickly
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
on
the
glass
theres
almost
no
malt
aroma
there
possibly
a
hint
of
saaz
hops
but
very
faint
most
of
the
aroma
is
skunked
very
skunked
the
flavor
is
crisp
and
clean
with
some
slight
spice
and
hint
of
caramel
but
the
skunking
is
there
as
well
the
body
is
very
light
and
the
drinkability
would
probably
be
better
if
not
for
the
skunked
character
a
clean
light
yellowpale
straw
colored
beer
has
a
big
foamy
white
head
and
some
good
lace
the
aroma
starts
with
a
light
sour
grassy
character
with
a
hint
of
lemon
in
the
background
there
is
a
soft
biscuity
grain
flavor
with
a
hint
of
lemon
again
on
the
finish
d
it
didnt
strike
me
as
outstanding
but
it
was
refreshing
and
clean
well
balanced
and
i
would
look
forward
to
drinking
it
again
opinion
this
is
not
my
favorite
pilsner
it
is
very
oddly
adjusted
so
the
flavors
dont
really
meld
it
tastes
like
there
is
an
adjunct
addition
that
is
very
out
of
place
and
has
no
business
here
overall
it
is
drinkable
but
not
great
a
disppointing
beer
given
that
a
cold
crisp
ale
would
go
magnificently
with
the
standard
sydney
road
fare
of
bread
dips
lamb
and
salad
this
was
ordinary
drinkability
through
the
roof
especially
with
slightly
spicy
food
well
balanced
the
beer
is
decent
and
better
than
i
anticipated
upon
pouring
i
could
drink
several
of
these
and
not
get
tired
of
them
probably
very
nice
on
a
hot
day
the
beer
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
towering
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
good
it
has
a
dry
pale
malt
scent
with
german
hops
and
a
bit
of
the
green
bottle
aroma
the
taste
is
good
it
has
an
extremely
smooth
and
creamy
pale
malt
flavor
that
goes
down
easy
and
finishes
dry
and
bitter
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
damn
fine
german
style
pilsner
its
smooth
and
flavorful
with
a
decent
aroma
a
good
drinker
the
beer
comes
in
a
pale
yellow
colour
and
pours

with

good
pilsner
i
mean
its
pretty
light
and
all
pretty
rish
but
not
exciting
the
overall
drinkability
seems
good
a
decent
beer
very
refreshing
and
cleansing

the
palatewilliamphilapajun

a
little
bit
of
cocoa
in
the
flavor
otherwise
a
straightforward
lager
overall
its
pretty
good
solid
pils
nothing
outstanding
but
very
solid
and
much
better
than
plenty
of
other
choices
out
there
would
get
again
good
shit
bro
awesome
beer
this
is
a
proper
representation
of
the
style
a
truely
great
drinking
experience
another
good
beer
from
this
brewery
makes
them
in
my
opinion
the
best
brewery
in
mexico
grupo
modelocorona
is
a
distant
second
with
their
meager
offerings
compared
to
a
brewery
that
produces
noche
buena
and
the
bohemia
series
overall
a
pretty
enjoyable
brew
great
with
food
the
best
beer
our
great
neighbors
from
the
south
have
provided
i
once
went
to
a
mexican
restaurant
and
the
stuck
a
lime
on
the
top
of
the
bottle
i
flicked
that
stupid
lime
in
a
second
and
informed
the
waiter
this
is
bohemia
a
real
beer
nolimerequired
this
is
the
best
beer
you
can
get
at
a
mexican
mini
super
its
very
good
in
comparison
with
all
other
beers
in
the
local
fridge
i
like
how
this
beer
quenches
my
thirst
but
makes
me
want
another
drink
too
goes
great
with
food
i
like
mexican
beers
alright
this
one
is
one
of
my
favorites
nice
and
crisp
this
is
a
very
good
beer
one
of
my
favorite
mexican
beers
pretty
decent
as
far
as
mexican
beer
this
price
goes
strong
malty
backbone
almost
no
sign
of
alcohol
in
this
one
drinkable
good
mexican
beer
pours
golden
with
good
clarity
and
lots
of
shine
fat
head
of
off
white
foam
that
lasts
well
but
does
not
leave
lace
nose
is
a
perfect
clean
grain
scent
with
a
shy
bit
of
sweetness
no
esters
from
yeast
and
no
hop
scents
on
the
nose
smells
like
bread
from
the
bakery
admirable
taste
is
good
creamy
body
with
a
slight
carbonation
deep
but
not
rich
grain
and
some
a
faint
sweetness
the
beer
finishes
clean
crisp
and
with
a
bit
of
lemon
very
very
good
drinks
so
easily

drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
always
finish
the
bottle
too
quickly
this
has
become
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
definitely
the
best
beer
ive
had
from
mexico
its
crisp
lightbodied
but
not
watery
and
fairly
smooth
all
said
pretty
refreshing
the
grains
do
keep
it
from
being
completely
clean

just
a
super
refreshing
subtle
clean

nothing
fancy
but
no
off
notes
here
to
speak
of
highly
drinkable
o
a
drinkable
beer
would
go
good
with
a
spicy
dish
that
requires
a
lot
of
drinking
the
beer
is
flavorful
this
is
a
good
beer
i
drank
three
of
these
watching
mexican
league
soccer
and
eating
at
my
local
mexican
restaurant
el
toro
in
springfield
oh
fajitas
are
fantastic
and
the
beer
is
cold
the
football
high
level
lot
of
emotion
this
is
a
good
european
lager
made
in
mexico
thank
emporer
maximillian
for
this
he
brought
the
austrian
and
german
brewers
with
him
long
ago
in
the
bottle
there
is
gold
top
and
silver
top
the
silver
is
a
dark
and
tasty
brew
if
you
can
find
it
good
beer
the
best
mexican
cheap
lager
out
there
for
sure
would
pair
incredibly
well
with
mexican
food
o
my
goto
mexican
lager
drinks
easily
with
enough
hoppiness
to
pair
with
the
spicier
dishes
if
youre
looking
for
a
north
american
pilsener
as
an
alternative
to
the
monster
brews
flooding
the
market
under
the
guise
of
ipas
or
double
triple
ipas
look
no
further
bohemia
is
hoppy
and
crisp
but
really
blossoms
when
the
cold
edge
softens
i
wouldnt
start
it
at
room
temp
but
it
rounds
out
as
it
warms
up
for
sure
the
mouthfeel
is
on
the
light
side
but
the
taste
packs
a
nice
hoppy
punch
its
well
balanced
too
but
definitely
hopforward
highlight
here
is
mouthfeel
very
crisp
aboveaverage
carbonation
while
retaining
flavor
throughout
very
pleasant
and
almost
nothing
id
rather
drink
on
a
beach
hulk
i
am
by
no
means
and
expert
but
i
have
been
telling
and
serving
people
this
beer
for
years
i
first
came
across
it
in
mc
allen
tx
and
then
in
juarez
mx
and
i
was
hooked
when
the
served
it
the
2nd
time
i
could
not
believe
that
a
border
beer
could
be
this
good
so
forget
all
the
floral
and
spicy
stuff
just
sit
back
sip
and
enjoy
overall
got
this
on
a
markdown
and
its
a
bit
better
than
i
was
expecting
wouldnt
actively
seek
it
out
but
it
wasnt
bad

really
a
drinkable
beer
and
im
glad
to
have
had
it
but
its
nothing
to
seek
out
a
foundation
of
sweet
malted
grain
makes
for
a
nice
balance
with
the
spicy
hops
well
balanced
and
has
some
flavor
not
a
bad
choice
if
your
looking
for
a
mexican
beer
to
pair
with
some
spicy
food
o
by
far
the
best
mexican
option
imo
a
really
nice
effort
on
a
german
pils
will
be
my
go
to
beer
when
i
am
eating
spicy
mexican
food
the
sweetness
of
this
beer
really
suits
well
with
the
spice
has
recently
2015
become
my
goto
cheap
beer
when
i
dont
want
to
spend
more
than
25case
hits
all
the
right
notes
in
my
mouth
and
wont
crunkify
you
too
much
even
if
you
have
a
couple
too
many
can
you
say
session
beer
somewhere
above
the
median
on
the
mexican
beer
spectrum
the
one
pours
a
real
light
clear
watery
wheat
color
with
a
short
lived
white
head
the
nose
is
very
generic
and
light
crystal
and
pale
malts
not
as
pilsener
as
indicated
but
not
offensively
cornmeal
adjuncty
like
a
sol
or
a
corona
although
the
flavor
of
this
is
only
mildly
better
than
either
of
those
it
honestly
doesnt
really
taste
like
much
which
is
actually
an
improvement
over
the
metallic
and
rancid
flavors
of
some
of
its
competition
very
crisp
finish
too
without
the
sweet
weirdness
also
improved
with
a
lime
wedge
as
infrequently
as
i
say
that
it
applies
here
ultra
light
mouthfeel
and
pretty
good
carbonation
i
would
take
this
over
most
other
mexican
beers
ive
had
save
pacifico
this
does
not
approach
a
good
quality
brew
but
in
a
hot
summer
setting
when
the
alternatives
are
mich
ultra
and
coronoa
light
this
is
my
horse
o
this
isnt
just
good
for
a
mexican
lager
its
a
legitimately
good
beer
period
merely
drinking
this
makes
me
think
about
78f
sunny
days
laying
on
the
patio
without
a
care
in
the
world
this
beer
has
just
given
me
a
a
goto
in
mexican
restaurants
b
something
to
buy
for
nonbeerdrinking
guests
when
hosting
a
party
and
c
something
to
actually
enjoy
besides
margaritas
should
i
ever
end
up
vacationing
in
cabo
san
lucas
overall
a
solid
beer
especially
when
compared
to
other
mexican
beers
the
taste
begins
with
moderate
malts
and
a
low
to
moderate
hop
bitterness
that
lingers
briefly
at
the
end
i
found
it
to
be
pretty
decent
for
the
style
overall
i
didnt
know
i
would
be
drinking
a
pils
but
if
i
had
to
reach
for
one
at
a
mexican
restaurant
i
would
choose
this
one
overall
about
what
you
would
expect
from
a
mexican
beer
its
better
than
corona
but
thats
not
saying
much
o
a
solid
mexican
beer
i
gotta
say
they
could
have
used
a
little
more
bitterness
and
a
little
bit
more
hops
and
a
lot
more
grains
but
overall
it
a
pretty
good
beer
gotta
say
this
is
hands
down
the
best
mexican
beer
ive
ever
had
pours
out
crystal
clear
with
a
nice
white
head
that
thins
out
into
a
layer
of
bubbles
corralled
by
very
little
lacing
the
body
is
a
light
golden
color
and
is
filled
with
some
mild
carbonation
mild
wheat
and
some
malts
come
through
very
mild
citrus
zest
as
well
but
not
much
elsevery
light
floral
notes
its
light
to
medium
bodied
and
you
can
feel
the
carbonationmalts
and
hops
are
present
along
with
some
spices
semisweet
overall
and
dry
there
is
a
hint
of
floral
flavors
in
this
one
overall
not
a
bad
beer
overall
a
nice
beer
a
bit
light
for
my
taste
and
maybe
a
bit
on
the
simple
side
this
would
be
a
beer
with
a
good
spicy
meal
though
overall
a
decent
example
of
a
german
pils
but
not
on
the
top
of
my
list
something
i
could
easily
have
a
6
pack
though
on
a
night
of
beer
drinking
something
to
check
out
if
you
have
a
chance
it
wont
dissapoint
but
it
wont
be
something
youll
write
home
about
either
odbetter
than
expected
blows
other
mexibrews
away
still
far
from
anything
i
would
by
again
as
i
only
purchased
a
single
but
hey
turns
out
it
was
worth
trying
perhaps
its
all
the
crap
ive
been
drinking
in
mexico
but
this
one
was
almost
good
oan
okay
beer
not
a
great
compliment
to
mexican
food
probably
will
not
buy
this
again
notes
if
i
had
one
suggestion
to
offer
it
would
be
to
add
some
additional
hops
flavor
to
more
closely
match
the
aroma
also
it
could
be
more
prickly
hops
that
being
said
bohemia
is
one
of
the
best
beers
out
of
mexico
and
among
my
top
3
choices
when
eating
at
a
mexican
restaurant
in
many
ways
its
much
like
a
munich
helles
lager
o
this
beer
is
a
cut
above
most
other
standard
mexican
lagers
and
is
relatively
easy
to
drink
your
betterthanaverage
mexican
lager
theres
a
light
crisp
flavor
to
this
sans
any
expected
hopefully
anticipated
hoppiness
not
much
aftertaste
either
it
finishes
clean
and
clear
unlike
my
experience
with
other
adjunct
lagers
this
is
what
it
is
and
it
does
what
it
does
i
didnt
expect
much
and
it
didnt
disappoint
my
expectations
you
could
do
a
lot
worse
in
a
massproduced
import
if
in
mexico
look
only
for
this
one
o
i
dont
know
if
this
was
the
result
of
a
dulled
palette
from
drinking
flavourless
beers
on
the
resort
but
this
mexican
brew
actually
boasts
some
flavourful
hop
characteristics
easy
drinking
and
mild
enough
on
the
palette
to
enjoy
in
the
intense
mexican
heat
the
best
option
in
mexico
imo
good
beer
overall
i
tried
one
in
a
mexican
restaurant
it
goes
well
with
those
dishes
and
has
a
pretty
good
taste
im
more
into
heavy
or
darker
beer
soo
this
one
was
just
ok
i
would
try
it
again
if
i
had
the
chance
depending
on
the
atmosphere
im
in
o
for
a
mexican
beer
bohemia
is
a
very
flavorful
choice
though
it
does
not
equal
other
beers
of
the
pilsner
style
it
does
shine
in
its
environment
i
travel
to
mexico
frequently
and
in
the
unrelenting
heat
of
merida
bohemia
is
blessed
not
so
bad
sanctuary
my
favorite
mexican
beer
pleasantly
surprised
and
i
recommend
for
a
hot
day
or
with
a
nice
spicy
meal
lovely
beer
certainly
not
your
typical
insepid
skunky
flavorless
mexican
brew
bohemia
is
a
crisp
fresh
tasting
pilsner
yes
pilsner
nice
malt
and
bitter
hop
balance
a
touch
of
sweetness
and
a
terrific
citrusy
aftertaste
this
has
become
one
of
my
go
to
beers
excellent
with
food
or
to
quench
that
desire
for
a
cold
brew
if
you
can
find
it
locally
try
it
and
please
no
lime
this
is
like
a
muted
pilsner
it
has
all
the
right
elements
but
with
the
volume
turned
down
those
elements
set
it
apart
from
a
lot
of
other
mexican
beers
but
it
doesnt
measure
up
so
well
against
other
versions
conclusion
i
like
this
beer
but
i
wouldnt
try
to
compare
it
to
the
classic
german
pilseners
as
it
would
fall
far
short
as
a
all
malt
lager
however
it
does
well
and
beats
out
almost
every
adjunct
lager
around
i
donknow
if
its
because
ive
been
in
mexico
for
two
weeks
and
limited
to
a
choice
between
corona
dos
equis
or
modelo
but
this
bohemia
was
like
flamenco
dancers
prancing
about
on
my
tongue
castanets
nipping
at
my
palate
in
comparison
to
beer
from
plzen
the
czech
republic
it
is
more
than
a
respectable
effort
solid
in
all
its
attributes
a
fine
pilsner
my
favorite
latino
brew
to
date
nothing
special
this
does
not
stand
out
from
a
crowded
pack
pass
my
new
favorite
mexican
beer
aside
from
negra
modelo
pours
a
cloudy
straw
gold
color
hops
are
abundant
in
the
nose
taste
is
like
that
of
a
german
pilsener
hop
bitterness
shows
its
head
towards
the
back
of
the
throat
the
beer
leaves
excellent
lacing
on
the
sides
of
the
glass
this
beer
is
also
fairly
carbonated
and
there
is
a
steady
stream
of
bubbles
issuing
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
this
and
negra
modelo
are
my
two
favorite
mexican
beers
overall
this
is
the
best
viennastylepilsner
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
mexico
offers
clean
refreshing
sessionable
versatile
enough
to
match
most
every
flavor
profile
on
our
menu
and
one
that
actually
has
some
complexity
to
it
overall
its
a
decent
highly
drinkable
but
not
really
exceptional
beer
this
is
a
pretty
tasty
lager
with
some
malt
sweetness
and
a
hint
of
fruitines
with
tinges
of
floral
notes
from
the
hops
which
are
pleasant
this
has
the
kind
of
sweetness
that
reminds
you
of
adjuncts
but
doesnt
go
too
far
and
is
nice
in
relation
to
the
highly
carbonated
almost
spicy
profile
i
enjoyed
this
thoroughly
and
will
probably
get
some
for
times
when
i
want
a
refreshing
beer
or
something
to
scrub
the
palate
when
i
am
enjoying
ribs
or
refried
beans
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
happens
upon
it
at
their
local
mexican
restaurant
like
i
did
this
is
surprisingly
smooth
and
well
blended
this
is
more
than
i
was
expecting
thus
far
my
favorite
mexican
lager
well
see
if
i
can
find
a
better
one
very
good
for
a
mexican
made
pilsner
german
pils
yeah
right
bohemias
probably
a
mexican
adjunct
lager
but
a
damn
good
one
at
that
will
accompany
many
a
carnitas
in
my
future
i
had
this
for
the
first
time
at
a
holeinthewall
mexican
restaurant
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
and
will
drink
this
each
time
i
enjoy
mexican
cousine
this
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
which
quickly
goes
away
the
smell
is
of
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
the
mouth
feel
is
light
and
crisp
the
taste
is
good
there
is
a
slight
sweet
taste
up
front
with
some
hoppy
tastes
on
the
way
down
very
crisp
the
bottle
i
had
also
has
a
weird
metallic
after
taste
almost
like
a
heineken
overall
this
beer
isnt
bad
theres
just
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
its
not
one
id
ever
keep
at
my
house
when
theres
nothing
else
i
love
on
the
menu
though
ill
order
it
pours
a
clear
yelllow
with
a
1
inch
white
head
that
fades
to
nothing
little
spots
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
sweet
grain
some
grass
and
citrus
zest
taste
is
the
same
as
the
smell
with
the
grains
and
citrus
zest
being
most
apparent
this
beer
has
good
carbonation
and
is
crisp
and
clean
in
the
mouth
overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
and
one
of
the
better
offerings
from
mexico
in
my
opinion
nice
bright
yellow
color
with
good
carbonation
smells
malty
with
mildly
floral
hops
the
taste
is
among
the
best
of
mexican
beers
ive
had
a
gentle
integration
of
hops
and
malt
but
far
more
interesting
than
a
modelo
or
corona
as
a
german
pilsener
it
does
well
for
the
style
with
a
thin
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
beer
that
complements
food
very
nicely
recommended
by
far
my
favorite
mexican
beer
a
good
hop
bitterness
smell
and
taste
that
you
enjoy
through
the
entire
drink
it
has
nice
malt
character
and
is
very
easy
to
drink
not
much
head
on
this
beer
and
what
is
there
disappears
very
quickly
if
you
want
to
barbeque
or
hang
out
by
the
pool
this
is
a
great
choice
do
not
put
fruit
on
this
beer
i
have
to
be
very
adamant
about
it
everytime
i
order
it
at
a
mexican
restaurant
servers
think
if
its
made
in
mexico
it
gets
a
lime
if
we
rated
by
the
price
this
beer
would
deserve
an
a
not
very
expensive
slainte
and
bueno
o
one
of
my
favorite
mexican
beers
most
of
my
favorites
are
from
the
bohemia
line
in
fact
this
one
is
easy
drinking
with
a
slight
hop
presence
and
a
nice
malt
backbone
the
smell
is
good
the
taste
is
unique
a
hint
of
potency
and
a
hint
of
sweet
similar
to
negra
modelo
but
has
its
own
style
for
sure
i
always
look
twice
in
the
stores
just
to
make
sure
i
didnt
pass
it
up
i
really
enjoy
bohemia
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
a
decent
pils
not
as
robust
as
many
but
good
stuff
from
south
of
the
border
overall
not
a
bad
brew
although
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilseners
little
over
a
finger
of
pure
blinding
white
foam
lacks
density
and
with
a
good
portion
of
larger
bubbles
resolves
down
to
the
surface
rapidly
you
get
a
little
residual
concentration
along
the
glass
sides
the
lacing
is
minimal
but
not
nonexistent
golden
colored
liquid
of
credible
depth
and
solid
throughout
even
darker
when
peering
down
into
the
glass
the
small
bubbles
well
dispersed
straw
sweet
grains
and
corn
make
up
a
good
portion
of
the
nose
however
its
not
simple
nor
obvious
has
a
fine
quality
which
slowly
draws
out
pepper
orange
peel
as
well
as
peach
apple
pear
scents
not
that
sweet
while
also
avoiding
any
bitter
greenness
lightbodied
with
a
steady
refreshing
carbonation
which
scrubs
the
palate
the
orange
lemon
citrus
plays
to
this
nicely
as
does
the
pepper
to
light
clove
spice
and
pressed
flowers
shade
of
natural
country
bread
but
not
yeasty
more
crunchy
in
feel
the
apricot
peach
apple
fruit
close
to
evanescent
maybe
just
maybe
a
dollop
of
honey
again
more
humbly
constructed
than
simple
just
a
beer
trying
to
be
a
beer
o
its
been
a
long
time
since
ive
had
this
beer
and
i
was
very
pleasantly
surprised
by
it
quite
an
enjoyable
beverage
pours
a
straw
yellow
hue
with
ample
carbonation
and
a
pencil
thin
soft
white
head
the
smell
is
crisp
and
grassy
with
mild
hop
presence
and
a
moderate
malt
backbone
the
taste
is
ver
refreshing
and
quite
crisp
with
a
slight
pleasent
grassyness
and
faint
hop
bitterness
overall
im
loving
this
beer
i
guess
after
a
day
mowing
the
lawn
in
90
degree
heat
it
might
suffice
but
ill
pass
not
offensive
but
little
there
overall
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
easy
to
drink
and
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
session
beer
for
a
german
pilsner
i
felt
that
this
wasnt
too
bad
with
not
being
a
huge
fan
of
pilsners
i
wasnt
expecting
to
enjoy
this
at
all
the
beer
is
a
moderately
good
with
some
good
hop
and
malts
on
the
nose
the
color
is
a
typical
yellow
with
a
white
white
that
fades
off
within
a
few
sips
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
some
good
carbonation
keeping
it
real
and
lighter
bodied
to
keep
is
refreshing
not
too
bad
of
a
beer
there
seems
to
be
a
noticeable
effort
put
into
this
beer
that
isnt
present
in
most
bland
mexican
lagers
but
its
not
enough
for
me
not
to
lump
this
in
with
all
the
others
as
uninspiring
insipid
swill
translucent
gold
with
a
thin
layer
of
foam
on
the
top
of
your
glass
in
the
same
fashion
some
of
the
european
lagers
this
beer
can
be
associated
with
the
smell
and
taste
are
gentle
and
perhaps
faint
for
some
tastes
yet
the
the
sensation
is
what
stads
out
it
is
quite
soft
as
it
goes
down
and
it
is
quite
refreshing
served
cold
on
an
iced
pint
on
a
very
hot
day
and
it
pretty
much
goes
with
any
spicy
food
or
meat
dish
clear
bubbly
yellow
with
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
fast
and
leaves
descent
lace
it
smells
of
floral
and
fruity
hops
hints
of
citrus
and
mild
biscuit
malts
very
mild
with
nice
touch
of
floral
hops
very
mild
and
medium
bodied
very
easy
to
drink
but
just
above
average
thin
white
head
sickly
pale
straw
body
corn
and
nut
smell
tastes
in
order
of
intensity
like
crayon
tobacco
and
wet
paper
not
refreshing
in
any
way
the
flavors
are
not
pleasant
perhaps
i
just
got
a
bad
bottle
ill
give
it
another
shot
some
day
because
i
really
feel
this
is
very
unenjoyable
the
first
thing
that
came
to
my
mind
was
is
this
just
supposed
to
be
the
style
regular
company
for
my
normal
day
food
from
notes
at
old
chicago
2001
poured
from
bottle
into
pint
glass
pours
medium
yellow
with
small
bubbly
white
head
nicely
chasing
bubbles
nose
is
sharp
clean
hops
and
slightly
acrid
malt
the
flavor
begins
with
a
mild
vegetal
hops
bite
that
segues
into
a
slightly
acrid
bitterness
rather
thin
mouthfeel
not
a
bad
beer
at
all
this
is
a
nice
pilsenerstyle
beer
from
mexico
which
pours
a
nice
golden
straw
color
that
you
can
easily
see
through
the
head
vanished
pretty
quickly
very
slight
fruity
aroma
with
a
very
clean
taste
i
enjoyed
it
and
will
even
buy
it
again
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
rjt
d
very
tasty
and
much
better
than
a
corona
or
dos
equis
definitely
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
would
buy
this
again
most
likely
to
pair
with
mexican
food
d
avg
beer
taste
nothing
special
tasted
much
better
ice
cold
but
again
nothing
special
d
taste
didnt
improve
with
warmth
would
probably
go
great
with
mexican
food
drinkability
this
is
a
good
beer
i
would
love
this
for
barbecues
holds
up
nice
and
easy
to
drink
a
great
all
around
social
beer
drinkability
this
is
an
incredibly
drinkable
beer
it
goes
down
easy
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
and
i
really
appreciate
it
doing
a
good
job
in
the
czech
style
i
will
buy
it
for
hanging
out
or
for
washing
down
dinner
this
beer
is
probally
one
of
the
most
fine
beers
of
all
of
mexico
when
you
go
to
mexico
locals
dont
drink
corona
etc
they
drink
bohemia
and
indio
these
are
from
the
finest
brewery
in
mexico
ive
had
the
opportunity
to
tour
the
facility
and
it
is
exceptional
and
i
urge
you
to
try
this
beer
drinkability
it
could
definitely
be
a
session
beer
though
i
wouldnt
want
it
to
be
my
session
beer
as
usual
im
glad
i
tried
it
though
it
wouldnt
end
up
in
my
crate
pours
with
a
clear
golden
straw
color
and
a
thin
white
head
that
vanishes
quickly
after
the
pour
there
is
no
lacing
happening
at
all
smell
is
good
lots
of
earth
tones
picking
up
floral
hops
and
grainy
malts
smells
a
little
bit
bitter
reminds
me
up
apple
juice
maybe
semi
sweet
white
wine
and
club
soda
considering
the
high
carbonation
although
in
between
these
flavors
theres
floral
earthy
notes
it
goes
from
sweet
to
earthy
and
then
finishes
a
bitter
clean
and
dry
this
is
quite
drinkable
the
flavors
are
balanced
well
no
flavor
is
too
overpowering
abv
is
low
this
is
a
good
session
for
me
this
is
one
of
my
go
to
beers
when
there
isnt
anything
better
every
now
and
then
ill
pick
up
a
six
pack
if
i
dont
feel
like
going
out
of
my
way
to
my
local
beer
store
drinkability
i
was
happily
surprised
by
this
beer
not
bad
at
all
this
beer
would
be
perfect
for
summer
in
my
opiniion
a
thirst
quencher
it
left
the
glass
very
quickly
and
i
found
myself
wanting
another
the
apppearance
was
the
only
thing
that
hurt
the
score
because
of
the
lack
of
head
and
head
retention
cool
little
bottle
too
this
beer
has
a
champagne
clean
look
with
a
nice
bubbly
carbonation
medium
head
wmed
retention
a
citrus
smell
orange
lemon
or
both
taste
is
good
kind
of
a
fuzzy
orange
feels
good
while
drinking
and
nice
and
lively
slight
aftertaste
i
prefer
this
beer
cold
and
would
drink
it
in
hot
or
cold
weather
pleasantly
surprised
with
this
up
until
tonight
i
thought
negra
modelo
was
the
best
mexican
macro
beer
i
found
a
better
one
wasnt
expecting
this
beer
to
be
especially
good
but
its
a
step
above
the
standard
mexican
lagers
quite
tasty
pairs
well
with
food
but
you
could
enjoy
it
alone
too
clear
golden
with
a
dense
white
head
that
leaves
some
decent
looking
lace
on
the
glass
slightly
above
average
aroma
with
untoasted
grain
mild
noble
hops
and
a
faint
soapiness
pretty
damn
good
for
a
mexican
pils
creamy
and
mildly
bready
with
brash
hop
flavor
that
sets
this
apart
from
standard
mexican
fare
must
be
the
dark
brown
bottle
smooth
and
medium
bodied
with
soft
carbonation
a
nice
beer
to
wash
down
some
enchiladas
for
sure
not
a
bad
drinkable
beer
but
not
something
id
stick
with
for
an
evening
golden
color
nice
head
after
the
pour
with
thin
retention
the
smell
is
fresh
clean
fruit
vanilla
the
flavor
is
good
solid
and
refreshing
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
the
carbonation
is
thin
but
has
the
right
amount
of
sharpness
i
get
vanilla
and
clean
light
fruit
flavors
and
it
is
true
its
german
heritage
but
for
all
its
strengths
it
lacks
something
vital
in
the
aftertaste
department
yup
thats
it
the
problem
is
a
bit
of
papery
flavor
and
a
slightly
chalky
dry
aftertaste
its
like
they
added
some
stale
hops
to
an
otherwise
great
beer
it
tastes
good
but
then
lets
you
down
a
bit
in
the
end
good
beer
not
great
beer
this
is
a
good
session
lager
that
also
contains
some
good
flavor
it
is
very
easy
to
drink
there
is
not
a
lingering
aftertaste
or
real
bitterness
it
is
neutral
in
that
respect
id
think
of
it
as
a
weak
ipa
md
average
mouthfeel
a
bit
lighter
body
than
i
wanted
the
drinkability
is
good
but
ill
only
have
one
of
these
with
some
mexican
food
or
perhaps
a
day
at
the
beach
i
would
drink
it
again
for
sure
cool
bottle
forgettable
contents
this
is
a
good
mexican
beer
and
a
nice
example
of
a
german
pilsener
i
will
have
no
trouble
finishing
the
other
5
bottles
as
far
as
beer
i
can
find
at
mexican
restaurants
i
would
definitely
order
this
again
it
went
great
with
my
meal
and
was
very
refreshing
drinkability
a
crisp
highly
drinkable
lager
with
just
enough
class
to
be
interesting
d
good
drinkability
but
heavy
enough
that
you
arent
going
to
down
4
of
these
in
a
row
and
that
isnt
the
point
for
a
beer
you
would
pair
with
a
meal
this
is
as
good
as
it
needs
to
be
d
a
pretty
drinkable
pilsner
near
the
upper
end
of
mexican
beers
drinkability
4
out
of
5
better
than
most
mexican
beers
out
there
i
definitely
recommend
it
if
youre
at
a
local
mexican
joint
and
want
a
cerveza
to
accompany
your
meal
its
full
enough
to
have
with
a
meal
yet
light
enough
to
drink
quite
a
few
of
skip
the
sols
and
tecates
and
coronas
and
have
a
bohemia
instead
overall
this
is
one
excellent
mexican
beer
my
favorite
out
of
the
country
by
far
for
the
style
which
im
not
a
big
fan
of
i
must
say
this
is
not
terribly
bad
drinkability
i
like
it
it
has
a
good
flavor
for
the
type
of
beer
it
is
overall
it
washed
down
the
spicy
mexican
cuisine
fairly
good
and
it
was
hot
and
humid
so
it
was
a
nice
thirst
quencher
so
technically
it
did
its
job
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
light
foamy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
bready
light
malty
aroma
nothing
noteworthy
smooth
malty
feel
and
flavor
maybe
some
breaady
flavors
with
a
very
faint
citrusy
finish
easy
to
drink
but
certainly
nothing
spectacular
if
youre
looking
for
mexican
brew
its
a
nice
change
from
corona
okay
representation
of
the
style
goes
well
with
mexican
food
d
went
well
with
mexican
food
and
i
prefer
it
to
something
like
corona
but
not
something
i
would
go
for
at
the
store
you
dont
usually
taste
any
hops
in
these
beers
but
they
are
present
in
bohemia
d
quite
a
good
refreshing
brew
which
was
very
surprising
since
im
not
usually
a
fan
of
mexican
beers
it
was
definitely
the
best
part
of
an
otherwise
lackluster
dinner
some
type
of
combination
pork
dish
if
i
remember
correctly
that
i
had
at
matador
mexican
restaurant
in
downtown
phoenix
az
pours
a
clear
golden
color
one
finger
foamy
white
head
that
disappeared
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
poured
with
no
lace
clean
smell
of
fruit
and
grain
corn
and
malt
taste
slight
hop
note
dry
light
mouth
feel
carbonation
was
ok
claims
of
roasted
barley
cocoa
like
bitterness
and
hints
of
vanilla
were
not
there
as
claimed
on
the
cardboard
carrier
not
something
i
would
buy
again
poured
into
a
shaker
pint
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
a
short
white
big
bubbled
head
that
quickly
goes
into
a
thin
ring
with
no
lacing
very
grainy
aroma
with
a
bit
of
hops
too
tangy
flavor
up
front
and
a
sweetish
finish
this
so
far
is
my
favorite
mexican
beer
in
this
style
very
drinkable
and
a
good
session
beer
day
12
this
one
is
a
treat
like
its
darker
brother
obscura
it
has
a
good
deal
of
flavor
and
that
nice
thick
foamy
goodnessmmm
you
dont
see
much
of
a
head
on
to
many
beers
down
here
this
one
is
nice
tastes
of
light
hops
corn
and
should
be
drank
ice
cold
they
tell
me
i
had
2
with
my
pascada
fish
and
they
went
very
well
together
best
mexican
beer
ive
had
even
though
its
a
distinctly
germanstyle
brew
or
vienna
or
whatever
it
is
d
easy
to
drink
great
for
quick
consumption
very
safe
for
any
food
situation
cheers
12oz
bottle
purchased
at
mckinnons
in
salem
pours
a
crystalclear
strawyellow
body
with
a
quarter
inch
of
shortlived
head
biscuit
and
caramel
malts
and
a
touch
of
hops
comprise
the
very
hardtodetect
aroma
biscuit
with
a
touch
of
caramel
a
slight
cooked
corn
flavor
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
hits
the
palate
initially
but
goes
away
rather
suddenly
aqueous
with
moderate
carbonation
very
drinkable
inoffensive
and
quaffable
definitely
good
for
a
hot
day
as
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
thirstquenching
not
sure
id
classify
it
as
a
german
pils
since
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
hop
presence
for
it
but
as
a
bohemian
pils
or
even
and
american
one
this
one
passes
with
flying
colors
a
great
german
style
beer
that
goes
amazingly
well
with
mexican
food
especially
with
a
bit
of
spice
in
it
it
is
not
too
strong
nor
too
light
just
perfect
and
has
a
nice
smooth
hoppy
flavour
and
satifies
well
i
also
love
the
appereance
with
its
dark
brown
bottle
and
golden
wrapper
a
favourite
of
mine
drinkability
very
light
easy
drinking
pilsner
not
very
exciting
but
it
does
what
it
does
quite
well
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
overall
ehh
it
was
not
terrible
but
was
really
rather
lackluster
i
did
not
have
a
huge
issue
with
it
per
se
but
i
needed
more
for
a
macro
like
lager
though
it
came
off
fairly
well
drink
this
beer
staight
from
the
bottle
it
was
not
intended
to
be
poured
into
a
glass
also
do
not
add
lime
or
salt
to
it
that
will
ruin
it
drink
it
right
from
the
bottle
and
you
will
get
the
viennastyle
goodness
that
these
guys
intended
you
to
get
a
very
worthy
brew
pours
a
light
yellow
color
nice
carbonation
small
white
head
with
some
sticky
lacing
left
behind
the
nose
is
malty
with
some
hops
slight
caramel
the
taste
is
slightly
sweet
malty
slight
hop
note
light
body
not
drinkable
would
not
buy
again
this
beer
pours
a
mildly
hazy
pale
golden
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
quickly
into
a
thin
cap
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
pale
malt
caramel
and
a
hint
of
noble
hops
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
but
a
bit
milder
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
decent
beer
that
i
could
drink
in
a
pinch
but
would
otherwise
bohemia
clasica
was
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
tiny
white
head
that
disappear
as
soon
a
possible
the
aroma
was
a
sweet
grainy
smell
the
taste
was
a
light
lemony
grassy
flavor
a
pretty
good
balance
between
malt
and
hops
the
mouth
feel
was
medium
bodied
with
little
carbonation
the
drinkability
was
good
abv
taste
and
price
all
reasonable
this
was
the
best
beer
that
ive
ever
had
out
of
mexico
which
is
not
saying
much
unfortunately
a
clear
pale
yellow
color
with
a
one
finger
short
lasting
fizzy
white
head
no
lacing
medium
carbonation
aroma
is
light
toasted
grain
and
a
bit
of
floral
hops
with
a
hint
of
lemon
zest
flavor
is
lightly
sweet
a
faint
bitterness
and
some
light
floral
hop
notes
short
hoppy
finish
much
like
a
euro
lager
quite
sessionable
i
would
guess
i
am
only
trying
one
nothing
wrong
with
this
beer
just
very
average
in
all
aspects
meah
very
quaffable
beverage
nice
initial
crisp
flavor
with
an
a
nice
subtle
bite
hint
of
honey
and
the
toasted
grains
are
present
with
an
almost
invisible
floral
aftertaste
lightly
carbonated
and
when
poured
doesnt
get
too
much
head
the
smell
is
grainy
and
malty
but
after
letting
the
beer
breathe
more
scents
come
through
slightly
citrusy
one
of
the
better
beers
mexico
has
to
offer
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
give
off
a
bad
first
impression
but
then
the
magic
shines
smell
is
a
balanced
hoppiness
with
some
bready
malts
we
can
also
add
some
vanilla
and
fruitiness
when
it
comes
to
taste
mouthfeel
is
very
crisp
and
it
is
a
very
sessionable
beer
one
of
my
favourite
mexican
beers
d
the
highlight
of
the
night
a
clean
pils
that
doesnt
shy
away
from
the
hops
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
out
there
and
one
that
i
will
purchase
in
the
future
drinkability
its
ok
when
drinking
it
while
eating
mexican
food
but
its
not
really
my
type
of
beer
the
mouthfeel
seems
right
for
a
lager
not
too
heavy
or
thin
i
can
drink
this
all
night
long
my
favorite
mexican
beer
it
could
be
cleaner
but
i
have
to
say
this
one
caught
me
off
guard
well
done
whatever
the
complexities
they
play
nice
throughout
the
bottle
amounts
to
good
drinkability
this
is
a
favorite
with
mexican
food
along
with
negra
modelo
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
golden
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
somewhat
sweet
taste
is
also
sweet
malts
with
some
hops
rather
refreshing
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
good
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
fairly
decent
brew
the
palest
of
gold
colors
did
this
beer
emit
the
head
was
was
white
and
pillowy
the
aroma
was
very
light
exuding
mostly
malty
notes
with
some
off
signals
on
the
palate
this
particular
icecold
specimen
had
little
to
offer
a
bland
malty
profile
finished
off
by
an
even
blander
hop
offering
i
didnt
not
find
any
of
the
flavors
to
be
offputting
but
i
felt
that
it
was
watereddown
d
the
best
mexican
pilsener
and
accompanies
very
well
every
meal
nicely
drinkable
a
well
made
mass
produced
beer
id
never
have
this
to
have
it
in
us
but
i
would
recommend
searching
this
out
in
mexico
deven
with
the
fuller
flavor
the
beer
still
seems
refreshing
and
highly
drinkable
even
compared
to
its
lighter
mexican
bretheren
it
is
crisp
on
the
pallet
and
the
head
is
thin
like
most
lagers
bought
a
single
of
this
one
pour
a
golden
brown
color
with
a
thin
head
a
little
lacing
i
smell
malt
and
grass
and
some
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
and
malty
a
little
hops
some
spices
i
dont
know
overall
its
a
thin
mouth
feel
not
real
robust
but
ok
and
easy
to
drink
ill
try
this
one
again
when
at
a
mexican
restaurant
instead
of
a
modelo
or
dos
equis
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
lager
outclassing
corona
by
leaps
and
bounds
drinking
several
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
or
with
some
spicy
south
of
the
border
fare
would
be
easy
and
very
enjoyable
bottle
poured
into
pint
glass
a
rather
drinkable
beer
a
little
more
body
than
the
old
standby
corona
color
was
amber
to
golden
but
the
taste
was
a
tad
watered
down
from
what
i
was
expecting
given
the
color
a
suitable
choice
great
compliment
to
my
spicy
dinner
not
sure
why
some
servers
think
there
is
a
need
to
add
lime
to
all
mexican
beers
though
this
was
a
very
very
nice
surprise
i
was
expecting
a
typical
macro
brew
but
this
was
really
quite
surprising
and
is
probably
my
new
favorite
mexican
brew
pretty
good
but
not
one
that
you
would
have
a
craving
for
id
definitely
drink
it
again
has
a
pale
gold
appearance
pours
with
a
moderate
head
that
quickly
dissipates
has
a
faint
but
agreeable
hops
aroma
taste
is
actually
very
good
with
malt
character
and
a
restrained
hops
presence
good
mouthfeel
with
nice
carbonation
i
think
this
is
a
surprisingly
good
beer
and
very
drinkable
also
some
extra
credit
for
a
really
attractive
bottle
distinctive
squat
brown
with
gold
foil
and
a
warrior
in
full
headress
one
of
my
favorites
overall
the
mouth
feel
of
the
beer
is
crisp
the
body
of
the
beer
is
light
and
the
finish
is
light
everything
about
this
beer
is
right
on
the
mark
for
a
german
pils
d
a
decent
beer
for
what
it
is
smooth
light
and
drinkable
certainly
better
than
a
lot
of
the
macros
out
there
not
my
first
choice
but
far
from
the
worst
d
it
would
probably
be
pretty
easy
to
throw
back
a
few
of
these
after
a
long
day
but
i
dont
know
id
want
to
im
just
not
very
impressed
with
this
brew
ill
take
this
brew
over
a
corona
on
cinco
de
mayo
everytime
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
medium
white
head
smells
slightly
of
grain
taste
is
malty
with
a
hint
of
fresh
corn
a
hint
of
saltyness
as
well
finish
is
sweet
with
a
nice
floral
hop
bitterness
mouthfeel
is
average
high
carbonation
drinkability
is
good
refreshing
but
good
flavor
one
of
the
best
mexican
lagers
ive
had
d
this
is
a
beer
that
i
will
return
too
often
my
wife
cooks
a
lot
of
el
salvadorian
food
and
this
will
pair
perfectly
it
doesnt
get
disgusting
at
warmer
temps
like
most
of
its
mexican
peers
which
is
nice
its
a
sold
mexican
brew
great
for
summer
or
paired
with
hispanic
cuisine
not
quite
as
full
flavored
as
i
hoped
but
goes
down
effortlessly
d
a
decent
brew
that
makes
for
an
ok
session
beer
d
very
nice
lighter
beer
could
drink
this
for
days
mild
texture
with
a
light
feel
just
like
a
good
pils
flavor
has
good
substance
and
the
beer
is
incredibly
refreshing
if
you
cant
drink
the
water
this
is
the
best
option
overall
an
excellent
beer
for
nice
days
outdoors
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
typical
pale
straw
gold
color
with
a
fizzy
white
head
aroma
is
faint
grains
and
corn
flavor
is
actually
not
too
bad
grainy
low
on
the
awful
corn
syrup
flavor
that
most
pale
lagers
have
might
even
be
a
touch
of
hops
with
a
light
fruity
note
thin
and
refreshing
definitely
the
best
choice
if
youre
at
a
taqueria
overall
it
was
ok
i
would
drink
it
again
but
i
dont
think
i
would
recommend
since
there
a
better
pilsners
out
there
d
a
good
beer
with
spicy
foods
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
out
there
so
many
beers
in
the
macro
market
make
puny
attempts
to
brew
pilsners
and
end
up
with
cheap
imitations
bohemia
nailed
it
just
right
it
is
a
very
nice
beer
and
i
highly
recommend
it
whether
youre
pairing
with
some
food
or
just
cooling
yourself
in
a
hot
day
d
very
drinkable
this
could
be
a
great
session
beer
drinkability
is
extremely
high
this
is
a
quality
pils
and
it
beats
the
shit
out
of
most
other
mexican
beers
i
could
definitely
see
myself
buying
a
sixer
only
7
99
which
is
damn
good
to
consume
on
a
hotass
summer
day
pour
is
golden
yellow
almost
a
mild
green
with
a
smell
white
head
nose
is
a
neutral
bitter
hops
and
apple
honey
pretty
much
the
taste
too
i
didnt
know
i
the
quality
are
that
much
different
but
the
mexican
pilz
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
malt
oriented
that
the
german
but
not
malt
forward
the
same
time
i
did
get
a
solid
lilac
floral
quality
though
deceiving
in
its
name
which
suggests
pilsner
status
and
mislabeled
as
a
german
pils
this
bright
rich
malty
brew
sits
firmly
in
amongst
some
of
the
better
helles
lagers
out
there
along
with
the
vienna
and
dunkel
lagers
brewed
by
dos
equis
and
modelo
this
addition
to
mexican
brewing
fits
in
well
with
those
brews
of
germanic
origins
and
is
a
nice
throwback
to
the
brews
of
the
austrian
immigrants
who
once
took
their
places
in
mexico
as
well
as
a
great
refreshing
and
flavorful
quaff
for
cinco
de
mayo
overall
i
think
this
will
might
be
my
go
to
beer
at
mexican
restaurants
but
i
need
to
try
more
all
in
all
this
one
is
pleasantly
drinkable
and
surprisingly
enjoyable
i
didnt
have
high
hopes
but
this
one
far
surpasses
flavors
and
aroma
are
beautiful
if
only
there
was
a
bit
more
character
to
the
hue
and
any
hint
of
lacing
but
all
in
all
not
a
bad
brew
at
all
in
a
pinch
this
could
be
my
pils
fix
drinkable
only
in
the
sense
that
it
really
doesnt
taste
like
much
this
beer
almost
has
to
be
drank
with
something
else
as
there
is
little
flavor
only
a
dedicated
bud
drinker
would
consider
this
a
clasica
import
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
lots
of
flavor
for
a
macro
and
pairs
well
with
spicy
food
good
beer
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
conclusion
very
nice
beer
for
a
macro
beats
the
piss
outta
corona
or
tecate
thats
for
sure
i
will
order
this
at
any
mexican
restaurant
or
the
next
time
im
on
vacation
in
the
beautiful
county
of
mexico
ole
its
not
a
bad
example
of
the
style
and
i
will
probably
try
it
again
i
just
cant
see
keeping
it
on
hand
d
a
very
enjoyable
cerveza
certainly
nothing
to
get
excited
about
but
its
handsdown
the
best
of
the
mexican
beers
this
is
always
my
first
pick
when
i
go
out
to
a
mexican
restaurant
with
a
mediocre
beer
selection
would
go
excellent
with
spicy
food
an
excellent
beer
could
pound
it
all
day
good
balance
and
the
fact
this
beer
isnt
heavy
make
this
a
good
choice
this
is
and
negra
modelo
are
my
favorite
mexican
beers
unless
i
go
to
guadalajara
where
everybody
drinks
estrella
then
i
gotta
say
what
everybody
says
aqui
estrella
es
la
cerveza
que
rifa
this
is
a
good
beer
worth
trying
and
drinking
on
hot
days
or
pairing
with
the
above
mentioned
food
i
forgot
how
much
i
paid
for
this
but
if
its
cheap
i
could
see
myself
drinking
some
of
these
on
a
hot
summer
day
my
favorite
mexican
beer
by
far
if
you
have
this
and
negra
modelo
available
you
can
pretty
much
skip
the
other
common
mexican
beers
this
beer
poured
yellow
with
a
thin
head
and
a
decent
amount
of
visible
carbonation
the
smell
is
sweet
malt
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
sweet
malt
with
a
bit
of
graininess
and
that
gives
way
to
a
pretty
small
amount
of
hops
and
clean
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
a
pretty
watery
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
where
this
beer
excels
is
in
drinkability
and
it
is
a
particularly
good
companion
to
spicy
food
this
is
a
real
treat
from
mexico
i
do
believe
this
is
the
best
export
our
neighbors
to
the
south
have
to
offer
atmosphere
is
okay
not
a
bad
flavor
feel
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
pretty
good
drinkability
though
serviceable
quaff
drinkability
is
quite
good
drinkability
great
with
mexican
food
although
i
prefer
dos
equis
amber
medium
mouthfeel
and
moderate
carbonation
make
this
extremely
drinkable
no
bitter
bites
or
off
flavors
terrific
rep
of
the
style
ill
be
getting
this
again
probably
more
for
the
summer
pours
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
bubbly
white
head
that
left
little
lacing
aroma
of
husky
grains
a
nice
floral
hoppiness
flavor
has
a
nice
hop
bite
at
the
beginning
grassy
lightly
sweet
pale
malts
in
the
middle
and
finishes
bone
dry
i
was
quite
impressed
with
the
hop
flavor
coming
from
a
mexican
beer
light
to
medium
bodied
crisp
clean
finish
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
and
quite
drinkable
probably
the
best
beer
youll
find
from
south
of
the
border
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
no
head
no
retention
and
no
lacing
smells
of
a
clean
lager
without
the
strong
adjunct
aroma
at
this
point
i
became
intrigued
doesnt
really
seem
to
fit
the
style
with
the
lack
of
hops
or
head
but
it
does
have
the
slightly
fruity
aroma
its
crisp
and
smooth
with
low
carbonation
tastes
of
a
clean
lager
without
the
strong
adjunct
association
some
of
the
flavor
is
masked
by
the
fruitiness
overall
very
drinkable
despite
the
initial
appearance
worth
a
try
taste
taste
is
similarly
hoppy
with
the
taste
of
oranges
notes
from
113004
very
unimpressive
beer
no
real
body
to
it
pours
clear
brown
with
a
shortlived
offwhite
head
moderate
lacing
grainy
straw
aroma
with
a
handful
of
corn
watery
bubbly
mouthfeel
more
hay
and
grain
in
the
taste
and
a
metallic
aftertaste
bland
notesfor
a
beer
so
mass
produced
it
was
pretty
good
d
very
high
d
this
has
just
enough
citrus
spice
to
cut
through
mexican
food
definitely
a
top
choice
at
local
mexican
joints
d
this
is
a
pretty
good
vienna
lager
really
one
of
the
best
commonly
available
mexican
beers
you
must
seek
this
beer
out
you
cannot
go
wrong
with
this
beer
of
the
readily
available
german
style
pilseners
in
my
neck
of
the
woods
this
one
is
certainly
right
up
there
as
a
first
choice
a
pretty
good
beer
from
mexico
definitely
better
than
most
beers
widely
available
here
in
the
states
you
can
trace
its
european
ancestry
with
its
use
of
hops
and
malted
barley
however
neither
is
very
prominent
as
the
beer
is
mediumlight
in
taste
and
profile
it
fits
very
well
with
mexican
food
another
thing
of
note
is
that
if
the
beer
is
made
with
the
use
of
adjuncts
corn
or
rice
it
is
done
with
a
rather
deft
hand
as
it
does
not
taste
like
it
again
the
taste
is
of
a
pleasant
light
maltiness
with
subdued
influences
from
the
hops
on
the
finish
good
food
beer
i
could
put
quite
a
few
of
these
away
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
and
im
glad
i
always
saw
these
mexican
beers
at
the
store
and
figured
they
were
all
coronatype
ones
but
this
is
a
solid
beer
for
sure
nice
attractive
look
to
it
with
some
good
ascending
bubbles
taste
is
mild
but
crisp
and
refreshing
theres
a
lot
more
taste
than
you
would
expect
from
the
appearance
which
is
good
a
nice
solid
beer
would
have
it
again
in
a
pinch
d
im
still
searching
for
a
good
beer
from
a
latin
american
country
this
isnt
one
of
them
its
a
pretty
ordinary
brew
all
around
i
dont
generally
drink
mexican
beers
and
this
was
the
first
time
i
tried
this
brand
and
beer
i
was
quite
surprised
at
how
pleasant
it
was
this
seemed
like
a
light
lager
by
appearance
and
taste
though
the
head
was
a
little
lacking
consequently
the
body
was
found
to
be
light
yet
the
beer
was
flavorful
with
a
nice
almost
malty
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
similar
to
what
one
would
find
in
most
of
the
american
large
brew
beers
very
drinkable
and
enjoyable
this
is
a
very
good
mexican
lager
blows
almost
everything
else
i
have
had
from
that
country
away
as
far
as
beer
goes
drinkablity
very
tasty
interesting
balance
between
hops
and
malt
results
in
a
very
refreshing
beer
d
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
its
drinkable
yet
complex
enough
to
make
you
pay
attention
as
you
drink
it
the
faint
sweetness
tempts
you
to
figure
out
what
you
are
tasting
you
can
also
just
relax
and
put
a
few
away
because
its
light
and
smooth
another
example
of
not
judging
a
book
by
its
cover
a
solid
mexican
beer
wrapped
in
foil
like
champagne
in
a
short
stocky
bottle
pours
a
clear
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
not
much
to
the
appearance
or
the
aroma
a
little
grainy
i
guess
the
rest
is
better
though
very
smooth
refreshing
and
lightbodied
semisweet
notes
with
a
little
more
flavor
than
others
of
the
same
category
i
must
say
this
goes
quite
well
with
mexican
food
and
they
are
very
easy
to
drink
my
absolute
favorite
mexican
beer
the
pour
is
a
nice
medium
gold
color
that
leaves
great
lace
on
the
glass
the
smell
has
slight
citrus
notes
with
a
crisp
malt
scent
that
is
very
inviting
flavor
is
out
of
the
park
with
a
nice
mild
hop
bite
in
the
front
followed
by
a
excelent
subtle
malt
sweetness
mixed
with
perfect
carbonation
levels
in
the
finish
perfect
pairing
with
any
spicy
food
or
if
you
need
a
refreshing
beverage
on
a
warm
day
look
no
further
d
very
high
this
is
a
session
beer
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
great
carbonation
and
a
sweet
hoppy
bitterness
i
will
drink
this
one
again
brewed
by
the
same
brewer
as
tecate
my
favorite
beer
so
i
had
to
try
it
similar
to
negra
modelo
which
i
feel
is
better
but
thats
just
me
this
is
also
a
great
beer
if
the
didnt
have
negra
modelo
i
would
probably
pick
this
up
i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
likes
to
explore
new
beers
this
is
quite
a
good
mexican
beer
i
dont
know
if
id
call
it
my
favorite
but
its
definately
in
my
upper
echelon
with
respect
to
whats
available
there
isnt
really
any
type
of
flavor
that
sticks
out
too
much
but
it
goes
down
very
easily
and
would
make
a
great
companion
on
a
hot
day
try
it
if
you
havent
already
theres
something
about
this
beer
maybe
it
reminds
of
the
days
of
seeing
who
could
pound
the
most
beers
but
this
is
a
lot
better
than
the
beers
we
used
to
pound
shudder
if
i
were
to
go
to
a
mexican
restaurant
this
would
be
my
first
choice
at
this
time
this
beer
is
unlike
any
other
for
one
it
has
a
vanillapilsner
feel
to
it
i
think
i
could
actually
sip
on
this
beer
all
day
and
not
get
sick
of
it
slightly
pale
and
a
very
pleasing
aroma
maintains
flavor
throughout
the
bottle
definetley
one
to
remember
pretty
nice
little
vienna
bonus
points
for
being
probably
the
best
brew
from
mexico
that
i
have
tried
great
summerbeachanytime
sessioner
had
this
at
a
mexican
restaurant
in
kittery
pale
yellow
color
with
a
very
small
head
poured
the
second
bottle
more
aggressively
still
a
small
head
little
aroma
some
sweet
corn
the
taste
was
faint
malt
with
a
tiny
hops
presence
thin
mouthfeel
it
did
however
pair
well
with
my
enchiladas
verde
overall
a
refreshing
pilsner
due
to
the
cornyness
id
call
the
beer
a
classic
american
pilsner
rather
than
a
vienna
lager
more
hop
aroma
and
flavor
would
help
adjust
the
balance
and
increase
this
beers
drinkability
id
finish
my
first
pint
but
probably
move
on
to
a
different
beer
for
number
2
d
goes
fine
with
most
mex
food
but
not
my
first
choice
thers
nothing
speichal
about
this
one
its
golden
and
smels
of
corn
with
verry
little
hops
this
one
is
comparable
to
budwiser
this
is
middle
of
the
road
for
taste
and
watery
its
not
the
worst
thing
ive
had
and
its
no
ware
close
to
the
top
of
my
list
its
just
average
not
bad
d
quite
a
good
mexican
beer
at
a
mexican
restaurant
would
defintely
have
again
if
i
was
in
that
situation
dthis
is
a
winner
an
enjoyable
lighter
colored
beer
from
mexico
would
seem
to
pair
nicely
with
spicy
foods
not
the
worlds
greatest
bohemian
pilsner
but
this
is
good
one
mexican
i
hadnt
tried
so
i
ordered
one
with
my
combo
plate
at
the
new
plazuelas
restaurant
in
eburg
what
a
pleasant
surprise
nice
pale
color
in
the
glass
with
quite
a
bit
of
white
foam
that
lasted
for
the
first
few
sips
icould
tell
from
the
pour
that
the
mouthfeel
body
carbonation
would
be
better
than
i
expected
not
much
smell
to
speak
of
though
perhaps
that
is
a
good
thing
sometimes
taste
was
up
front
malt
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
no
offtastes
no
metallic
or
adjunct
flavors
to
speak
of
just
a
very
nice
refreshing
beer
with
a
tiny
bit
of
hops
bitterness
at
the
end
of
the
swallor
to
keep
you
wanting
to
raise
the
glass
great
change
of
pace
from
the
usual
mexican
beersand
the
food
was
good
too
nice
all
the
way
around
taste
is
lightly
maltysweet
and
a
little
spicy
with
herbal
grassy
hops
and
a
nice
bitter
finish
tiny
lingering
syrupy
sweetness
otherwise
nice
and
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
with
drinkability
unequaled
by
anything
else
ive
enjoyed
from
south
of
the
border
poured
an
insanely
clear
straw
golden
color
with
a
foamy
light
head
that
hung
around
for
a
minute
or
2
the
aroma
is
clean
and
malty
lightly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
hops
the
taste
is
so
much
cleaner
than
i
would
have
expected
from
a
shitty
mexican
brewery
the
hops
dont
play
a
big
part
here
but
from
what
you
can
taste
its
nice
the
graininess
and
malty
sweetness
dominates
there
is
a
corny
hint
to
it
which
bothers
me
a
tad
decent
bitterness
light
in
the
feel
but
not
too
bad
if
i
were
eating
mexican
food
and
had
to
have
a
mexican
beer
it
would
certainly
be
this
i
would
do
a
few
of
this
but
the
grain
and
corny
sweetness
might
get
obnoxious
conclusion
while
i
was
at
dinner
in
old
town
i
wanted
to
taste
something
new
i
had
never
heard
of
this
brew
when
i
saw
it
on
the
menu
i
had
to
see
if
it
was
any
good
most
major
mexican
brewers
have
disappointed
but
this
one
blew
my
socks
off
it
was
actually
good
and
worth
the
price
of
admission
it
was
so
good
that
even
the
wife
like
it
and
recommended
i
pick
up
some
at
a
later
date
nice
brew
definitely
recommended
md
light
bodied
and
very
crisp
a
very
refreshing
beer
and
very
drinkable
dthis
was
a
nice
suprisei
will
be
having
this
again
soonpaired
with
fajitas
these
would
go
down
easier
than
a
ten
dollar
we
drinkability
an
easy
drinking
beer
i
could
session
with
this
had
one
previous
to
review
with
with
some
lightly
spicy
mexican
food
it
paired
nicely
with
it
if
i
have
to
have
a
mexican
beer
this
one
while
not
my
first
or
second
choice
would
do
in
a
pinch
seems
macro
lagerish
but
is
just
a
step
above
yet
its
not
quite
a
full
on
vienna
lager
imo
not
sure
where
to
go
with
this
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
diappointing
head
also
there
are
some
unidentifiable
objects
floating
around
the
aroma
is
faint
but
does
have
some
slight
notes
of
maltiness
the
taste
is
of
bready
malt
and
not
much
else
its
not
grainy
or
adjuncty
just
bland
the
feel
is
light
and
nicely
carbonated
finishes
neutral
drinkability
is
good
no
offputting
flavors
bland
for
the
most
part
just
a
hint
of
malt
i
believe
this
brew
has
its
place
it
good
for
when
you
want
something
light
and
you
dont
need
to
serve
it
ice
cold
to
drink
it
d
perfect
with
spicy
food
i
will
order
this
one
again
hopefully
ill
be
able
to
track
it
down
on
tap
drinkability
when
surrounded
by
mexican
lagers
it
would
be
certainly
be
more
desirable
than
say
a
corona
light
surely
it
would
go
great
with
combo
14
8
and
12
at
your
local
mexican
eatery
oelergud
this
is
a
nice
beer
to
have
with
any
mexican
dish
like
my
sante
fe
burrito
or
just
for
drinks
with
some
of
your
amigos
negra
modelo
is
still
superior
in
my
mind
but
bohemia
is
a
good
call
too
crystal
clear
bright
yellow
with
small
white
head
that
dissipated
quickly
not
much
noticeable
carbonation
bubbling
really
no
detectable
aroma

little
sweet

taste
initially
with
a
little
hop
finish
very
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
summer
brew
after
mowing
the
lawn
on
a
hot
day
lightmedium
carbonation
and
body
very
drinkable
ive
had
only
three
mexican
beers
in
my
life
the
first
two
were
corona
and
dos
equis
bohemia
is
by
far
the
best
of
the
three
it
does
have
the
overly
carbonated
mouthfeel
endemic
to
south
of
the
border
breweries
however
overall
ok
i
was
out
to
eat
with
my
gf
and
i
asked
for
a
sweetwater
and
they
brought
me
a
dasini
so
i
was
forced
to
stray
from
the
corona
corona
light
and
xx
it
wasnt
too
bad
though
this
is
one
of
the
better
mexican
lagers
out
there
it
poured
lighter
than
one
would
expect
from
the
style
but
it
was
a
slightly
darker
shade
of
straw
than
most
macro
lagers
it
had
a
pretty
typical
beer
smell
that
is
to
say
some
malt
adjunct
and
a
touch
of
skunk
but
it
was
pleasing
the
taste
was
surprising
while
there
were
corn
adjuncts
floating
around
in
the
background
it
had
a
pleasing
light
malt
taste
with
a
very
mild
but
actually
present
hop
profile
it
went
down
easy
and
i
was
ready
for
another
this
might
now
be
my
go
to
mexican
beer
d
this
would
make
for
a
great
beach
type
beer
and
was
moderately
good
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
foamy
head
little
retention
and
spotty
lacing

spicy
hopping
with

great

pours
out
a

good
retention
smells
of
bready
crackery
malts
with
a

sweetish
honey
aroma
lots
of
floral
hops
in
the

malt
is
rather
light
and
unobtrusive
in
the
flavor
but
makes
way
for
a
bright
fruitiness
and
loads
of
jasmine
tastes
almost
like
a
mix
of
a
helles
lager
and
some
iced
jasmine
tea
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
in
the
finish
slightly
more
than
say
a
coors
banquet
mouthfeel
is
light
and
effervescent
excellent
drinkability
refreshing
and
full
of
my
favorite
kind
of
hop
presence
a
floral
one
best
mexican
beer
ive
ever
had
for
sure
does
not
need
a
lime
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
from
mexico
sure
beats
the
other
mexican
beers
of
the
samesimilar
style
that
ive
had
by
far
a
good
example
of
a
vienna
lager
i
would
say
i
liked
it
a
bit
more
than
the
score
reflects
a
good
brew
to
pair
with
mexican
or
any
spicy
food
or
as
a
session
brew
on
its
own
overall
this
one
and
negra
modelo
are
my
favorite
beers
to
drink
they
are
very
good
beers
tried
this
one
for
the
first
time
in
quero
terro
mexico
in
2002
i
was
at
a
little
pub
enjoying
some
acoustic
music
this
was
the
most
expensive
beer
they
had
at
a
dollar
fifty
i
had
this
beer
at
a
mexican
restaurant
it
really
went
well
with
my
spicy
beef
burrito
it
poured
out
with
very
little
head
but
plenty
of
carbonation
it
wasnt
overly
hoppy
but
there
was
something
about
it
that
worked
perfectly
with
spicy
food
it
also
wasnt
too
heavy
which
made
it
good
for
a
dinner
beer
not
a
bad
session
beer
but
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
the
way
for
either
drinkability
was
pretty
high
cause
its
like
sugar
water
with
a
touch
of
booze
very
neutral
washed
down
a
big
ol
burrito
like
nobodys
business
uno
cervesa
es
muy
bueno
my
personal
favorite
bottles
brew
from
mexico
nice
12
head
when
poured
setttles
into
an
attractive
lacing
smooth
over
the
palate
nice
pale
amber
hue
hints
of
vanilla
and
honey
no
bs
no
lime
wedge
needed
here
dont
fruit
the
beer
d
nice
and
smooth
with
a
slight
hop
bite
wonderful
for
a
mexican
macro
certainly
the
only
beer
i
actually
look
for
when
in
the
country
one
has
to
put
what
you
are
drinking
into
perspective
drinkability
different
but
not
a
good
different
i
would
turn
down
another
of
these
im
pretty
sure
also
that
this
is
not
a
vienna
lager
probably
a
pilsner
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
if
scarfing
down
some
rice
and
beans
along
with
it
i
had
this
before
i
became
a
beer
connisseur
and
thought
this
wasnt
bad
had
it
again
recently
and
i
cant
say
that
i
was
impressed
better
than
most
mexicanbrewed
beer
which
is
usually
similar
to
a
usmacro
more
hops
evident
than
in
the
usual
standard
mexican
fare
pretty
smooth
and
drinkable
but
no
real
distinguishable
characteristic
not
offensive
i
recently
vacationed
in
mexico
and
while
id
had
this
beer
before
in
the
us
i
dont
recall
it
being
as
tasty
as
i
found
it
in
mexico
the
beer
poured
a
pleasant
amber
color
with
a
lot
of
carbonation
in
the
mouthfeel
there
was
a
rather
mild
but
nonetheless
pleasing
sweet
maltiness
in
the
beer
but
not
a
discernible
hop
presence
this
and
modelo
especial
were
the
two
beers
i
consumed
most
during
my
mexican
vacation
overall
bohemia
was
a
surprise
for
me
i
ordered
it
randomly
at
a
mexican
restaurant
thinking
it
would
be
the
usual
mexican
beer
but
for
me
it
is
probably
the
best
beer
i
have
had
coming
from
south
of
the
border
paired
two
of
these
with
a
puerco
en
mole
dish
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
ok
not
too
filling
decent
representation
of
style
i
could
drink
a
few
of
these
but
i
think
it
would
be
better
with
food
and
there
are
better
beers
in
the
style
slight
hop
aroma
but
nice
hop
flavor
didnt
quite
expect
it
but
id
say
it
is
like
a
sam
adams
of
mexico
i
didnt
think
they
used
hops
for
flavor
in
mexico
but
apparently
they
do
nice
citrusy
flavor
that
would
go
great
with
any
mexican
meal
it
is
very
clear
with
a
small
head
but
some
lacing
overall
a
great
beer
for
a
warm
day
d
good
with
mexican
cuisine
or
when
baking
yourself
out
by
the
pool
not
very
interesting
but
worlds
better
than
any
other
mexican
lager
ive
had
bought
this
one
in
cozumel
mexico
at
a
street
vendor
i
wasnt
expecting
much
out
of
any
mexican
beer
but
this
one
ended
up
being
rather
decent
the
smell
and
flavor
was
what
made
it
good
for
me
although
it
was
thin
and
fizzy
like
all
hot
weather
beers
seem
to
be
it
had
an
allmalt
taste
it
almost
had
a
hint
of
caramel
in
it
as
it
went
down
it
was
shortlived
after
the
watery
taste
bled
through
but
it
was
better
than
drinking
more
corona
or
a
sugarfilled
daquari
oh
and
if
youre
ever
in
a
mexican
bordertown
stay
away
from
the
nachos
eeesh
i
added
a
lime
to
give
it
a
little
extra
zing
and
this
really
worked
the
best
beer
ive
found
in
cancun
it
even
has
bitterness
i
dont
know
about
the
vienna
lager
label
on
ba
this
looks
and
tastes
like
a
pilsner
say
one
from
bohemia
it
also
reminded
me
of
a
less
bold
version
of
the
sly
fox
pils
it
has
a
slightly
bready
flavor
with
grassy
and
floral
hops
drinks
very
crisp
and
it
great
for
washing
down
food
or
just
relaxing
two
bottles
of
this
helped
me
put
down
27
jumbo
shrimp
any
beer
that
can
do
that
and
taste
good
is
alright
in
my
eyes
not
the
best
pils
but
its
in
a
brown
bottle
and
a
good
choice
is
vacationing
in
mexico
one
of
the
better
mexican
beers
but
still
nothing
to
rave
about
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
poured
a
clear
yellow
forming
a
thin
1
inch
head
with
lots
of
carbonation
thin
rings
of
lace
on
the
glass
the
aroma
is
slightly
skunky
along
with
a
little
corn
smell
the
taste
isnt
bad
but
its
not
really
good
either
very
little
flavor
mostly
a
slight
grain
flavor
but
mostly
just
like
water
light
mouthfeel
overall
not
bad
but
this
isnt
a
beer
i
would
drink
more
than
one
of
tastes
alright
fairly
simple
and
light
best
as
food
accompaniment
i
used
chips
and
salsa
this
brew
goes
well
with
spicy
food
becomes
hard
to
drink
when
it
starts
warming
though
this
was
the
first
beer
from
a
12beer
sampler
pack
assembled
by
my
awesome
father
in
law
as
a
birthday
gift
from
the
blue
max
httpbeeradvocate
combeerprofile1287viewbeerfly
many
obscure
enticing
porters
and
pub
ales
to
explore
im
glad
this
one
is
out
of
the
way
an
average
mexican
lager
average
all
around
could
be
a
bit
tastier
but
for
this
type
of
beer
its
perfectly
acceptable
not
something
id
seek
out
but
not
something
id
reject
its
a
pale
straw
color
that
pours
a
nice
head
but
shrinks
considerably
after
a
minute
it
has
a
a
nice
hop
aroma
that
doesnt
leave
you
gasping
for
air
with
caramel
notes
in
the
back
the
beers
slightly
sweet
with
a
hoppy
profile
but
not
bitter
its
very
refreshing
and
easy
to
drink
making
it
a
good
choice
when
one
is
thirsty
and
doesnt
want
to
drink
water
remember
this
is
a
mexican
beer
thats
built
for
easy
comsumption
but
more
importantly
it
tastes
pretty
darn
good
and
that
characteristic
puts
it
above
other
mexilagers
drinkability
theres
not
much
going
on
in
this
one
but
what
is
present
is
a
flavor
that
ill
be
happy
to
pass
on
next
time
i
see
it
a
cleanlight
mouthfeelpleasing
and
refreshingvery
drinkable
a
good
mexican
session
beer
very
enjoyable
citrus
bite
really
adds
to
drinkability
a
forum
post
said
this
was
the
best
mexician
beer
made
me
give
it
a
try
id
have
to
agree
with
this
d
not
my
favorite
mexican
lager
but
not
bad
the
lime
helped
with
my
only
other
mexican
beer
expierence
being
corona
and
dos
equis
i
found
this
beer
to
be
nicely
suprising
pours
a
very
lear
light
gold
tons
of
bubbles
looks
refreshing
the
smell
is
a
cross
between
grainyness
with
slight
hops
and
spicy
grass
overall
pleasnt
very
nice
taste
touch
of
hop
flavor
no
offensive
tones
goes
down
real
smooth
for
little
aftertaste
could
definitly
see
drinking
a
few
of
these
definitly
my
favorite
mexican
beer
actually
a
nicely
quaffable
little
brew
really
surprisingly
good
this
beer
pours
a
golden
color
that
is
akin
to
urine
with
no
darkness
or
haze
to
it
the
smell
is
unfortunately
the
same
with
just
a
hint
of
wheat
behind
it
the
taste
is
very
light
much
like
an
american
macrolager
a
bit
of
carbonation
as
well
keeps
this
beer
from
lingering
on
the
tongue
too
long
but
still
is
not
able
to
get
the
taste
down
in
enough
time
i
imagine
the
only
reason
youd
drink
this
beer
is
if
you
were
in
mexico
and
you
wanted
some
local
flavor
but
its
definitely
not
something
youd
seek
out
otherwise
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
very
little
head
and
it
vanishes
quickly
smells
like
a
beer
tastes
like
a
beer
not
really
bad
and
better
than
a
lot
of
brews
ive
had
of
late
wellbalanced
and
easy
drinking
i
could
easily
put
a
few
of
these
away
all
and
all
not
a
bad
brew
could
whack
quite
a
few
back
would
make
a
decent
session
brew
this
is
a
good
beer
for
the
masses
while
not
what
i
would
expect
in
a
vienna
lager
this
is
a
decent
beer
overall
one
of
only
a
small
handful
of
mexican
beers
i
like
to
drink
no
big
frills
here
but
is
good
enough
to
enjoy
with
mexican
or
even
a
six
pack
at
home
this
brew
pours
to
a
light
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
that
breaks
down
quickly
leaving
a
slight
film
on
the
top
the
aroma
is
sweet
with
some
actual
hops
that
is
noticeable
also
a
slight
skunky
aroma
but
not
over
whelming
and
in
truth
does
not
impact
the
brew
too
much
noticeable
grain
like
flavors
with
a
fair
amount
of
malt
which
finishes
with
a
slight
but
nice
and
noticeable
hop
taste
this
brew
is
not
bad
it
was
the
first
one
that
i
came
across
where
i
could
actually
pick
up
a
noticeable
hop
flavor
for
the
brews
that
i
have
had
while
in
mexico
i
would
say
that
this
was
middle
of
the
pack
possible
something
that
i
would
get
while
at
a
mexican
restaurant
but
have
some
others
that
i
like
a
bit
better
im
not
a
fan
of
putting
lemons
or
limes
in
a
beer
and
i
dont
think
any
kind
of
citrus
fruit
could
have
rescued
it
i
think
the
taste
was
very
clean
and
crisp
the
mouthfeel
was
very
nice
it
was
a
little
softer
than
a
lot
of
lagers
but
very
nice
i
rate
this
pretty
high
on
drinkability
my
standard
of
drinkability
is
rating
it
by
how
well
i
think
i
could
drink
a
brew
all
night
i
could
drink
this
one
all
night
an
awesome
mexican
beer
and
a
wonderful
exmple
of
the
vienna
lager
style
as
well
this
was
tasty
and
i
recommended
it
update
mexico
is
now
getting
more
serious
about
craft
beers
so
i
may
have
to
retract
my
best
mexican
beer
period
statement
but
it
is
still
the
best
mass
produced
mexican
beer
the
taste
here
is
a
bit
tangy
no
i
didnt
put
the
lime
in
something
i
look
for
more
in
a
mexican
lager
than
vienna
but
im
not
splitting
hairs
the
brew
is
light
and
sweet
slick
and
springy
on
the
tounge
and
goes
down
smooth
overall
one
of
the
better
mexican
lagers
i
have
had
d
goes
down
smooth
due
to
wateriness
but
i
wont
be
grabbing
another
even
if
its
free
overall
bohemia
is
a
very
nicely
done
wellrefined
europeanstyle
lager
that
easily
stands
up
to
its
predecessors
and
deserves
more
attention
than
it
gets
bohemia
pours
a
light
yellow
with
a
white
head
from
a
brown
twelve
ounce
bottle
grainy
and
banana
like
aromas
are
present
i
dont
think
theres
supposed
to
be
banana
like
aromas
banana
like
flavors
are
also
present
in
the
taste
after
the
beer
aired
out
briefly
i
can
no
longer
taste
banana
or
smell
it
grainy
flavors
dominate
a
little
bit
of
a
citrus
twang
too
actually
not
too
bad
for
a
mexican
offering
worth
a
try
drinkability
this
is
an
easy
drinker
its
a
little
complex
but
not
much
its
a
good
bad
porch
drinkin
beer
it
vaguely
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
but
still
doesnt
come
close
still
it
serves
a
different
purspose
i
suppose
d
this
is
not
something
i
would
drink
regularly
but
definatly
what
ill
be
ordering
the
next
time
i
go
out
for
mexican
food
i
recommend
drinking
it
with
out
adding
lime
many
mexican
restaurants
in
texas
will
carry
this
beer
one
warning
since
this
beer
is
not
as
well
known
as
other
mexican
brews
it
may
have
been
sitting
in
the
storage
room
for
a
while
like
all
beers
if
its
old
it
may
start
to
get
a
bit
skunky
if
you
get
a
bottle
from
a
fresh
batch
you
will
not
regret
trying
it
light
body
with
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
this
beer
can
be
heavily
consumed
in
hot
weather
and
accompanies
a
good
mexican
dish
like
no
other
this
is
still
my
allaround
favorite
mexican
beer
to
date
cheers
bottom
line
a
good
vienna
lager
thats
worth
trying
and
even
buying
from
time
to
time
good
beer
and
rivals
negra
modelo
as
my
favorite
from
southoftheborder
between
this
and
a
diet
pepsi
id
take
the
pepsi
between
this
and
a
bud
light
its
be
a
real
tought
call
and
id
hem
and
haw
a
little
but
i
guess
id
settle
for
this
overall
a
very
tasty
and
hoppy
lager
likely
the
best
offering
from
south
of
the
border
delicate
but
tasty
this
might
just
edge
out
negra
modelo
next
time
i
go
for
mexican
food
this
beer
is
pretty
light
for
a
darfker
tasting
beer
i
loved
the
smell
the
taste
everrything
about
this
beer
except
for
the
colr
the
color
isnt
as
full
as
it
could
be
however
i
still
think
this
is
a
great
tasting
beer
that
is
pleasing
to
the
nose
after
a
sip
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
if
youre
ever
at
a
mexican
restaurant
ask
your
waiter
to
get
you
one
of
these
note
i
didnt
detect
any
sourness
or
skunkiness
in
the
aroma
or
flavor
as
some
other
reviewers
have
noted
what
a
great
beer
to
have
with
a
mexican
dinner
rather
than
grabbing
a
domestic
american
beer
this
beer
is
a
wise
choice
not
a
strong
brew
it
has
light
malty
taste
that
tickles
the
senses
try
it
with
a
chicken
burrito
makes
for
a
great
dinner
heres
a
crisp
clean
mexican
lager
that
might
actually
have
something
to
offer
while
the
nose
is
quite
faint
bordering
on
nonexistent
there
is
a
crisp
bitterness
that
establishes
itself
early
on
in
the
palate
and
lingers
on
well
into
the
finish
along
the
way
an
easy
malty
sweetness
is
noticeable
but
it
is
this
wellplaced
albeit
mild
bitterness
that
causes
bohemia
to
stand
out
from
most
of
the
other
mainstream
mexican
lagers
drinkability
this
would
make
a
fine
summer
brew
something
to
quench
your
thirst
with
and
little
else
not
terribly
complex
but
then
thats
not
always
a
bad
thing
a
good
tasty
vienna
lager
treat
opinion
i
was
surprised
by
this
beer
it
is
really
light
but
manages
to
retain
a
significant
maltiness
it
has
enough
presence
from
the
vienna
malt
that
i
truly
believe
that
this
is
a
representation
of
the
vienna
style
i
thought
that
it
was
a
bit
lacking
in
dextrines
and
just
allaround
chewyness
but
still
an
approachable
beer
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
from
mexico
i
invite
people
to
try
bohemia
pours
a
pale
transparent
corn
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
nose
is
a
little
astringent
with
some
skunked
malt
tastes
like
a
sweet
malt
liquor
skunky
sugary
corn
favorably
less
skunked
than
corona
better
than
i
remembered
it
last
spring
break
in
lake
havasu
city
az
before
i
became
enlightened
and
was
on
a
mexican
beer
binge
but
certainly
doesnt
compare
well
to
the
sam
adams
boston
lager
i
had
earlier
in
the
night
thin
and
bubbly
mouthfeel
the
best
of
mexican
macro
lagers
ive
had
thus
far
though
if
thats
any
consolation
beer
mexican
that
widely
remembers
the
birthplace
of
the
brewmaster
who
create
it
very
czechoslovakian
in
its
flavor
a
pleasing
aroma
and
flavor
to
czech
lupulos
with
ambar
dark
a
bottle
in
presentation
of
12
ounces
with
its
pico
de
oro
gold
tip
done
by
cerveceria
cuauhtemoc
of
mexico
excellent
in
its
presentation
is
one
of
the
most
expensive
by
bottle
domestic
beers
in
my
country
i
do
not
know
why
this
beer
is
cataloged
as
not
reccomended
but
i
do
reccomend
it
perhaps
one
of
the
best
mexican
beers
or
one
of
the
less
awfull
it
has
a
bitter
tatse
but
a
sense
of
it
is
dark
remains
until
you
see
it
it
is
clear
the
problme
is
that
is
considered
a
craft
beer
and
it
is
not
nothing
special
but
a
decent
refreshing
beer
for
hot
weather
pours
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
bubbly
white
head
two
fingers
slowly
become
a
ring
of
foam
that
doesnt
leave
much
lacing
you
can
smell
the
sweet
malt
and
noble
hop
after
the
pour
but
aroma
becomes
bland
once
the
beer
has
settled
the
pale
toasted
malt
flavor
seems
more
influenced
by
pilsner
and
munich
malts
than
vienna
the
hops
are
unbalanced
enough
to
leave
traces
of
skunk
in
the
aftertaste
its
surprising
that
a
mexican
style
vienna
would
appear
more
like
the
original
german
light
in
body
and
carbonation
it
is
fairly
drinkable
but
lacks
the
residual
sweetness
and
roasted
flavor
key
to
the
vienna
style

oz

a

rather

good
drinkability
with
a
slightly
metallic
finish
that
detracts
a
typical
mexican
beer
you
cant
judge
a
beer
by
its
color
i
guess
one
of
the
tastiest
brews
ive
had
in
a
while
i
liked
this
beer
much
better
than
other
common
mexican
lagers
im
rating
this
as
a
pale
lager
straw
yellow
in
color
with
a
good
white
head
i
left
the
lime
the
waitress
brought
out
mild
malt
aromas
of
light
bread
and
lighter
biscuit
the
faintest
of
hop
aromas
flavor
is
clean
and
balanced
yet
leanng
toward
the
bitter
side
the
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
but
could
do
with
a
little
more
body
a
good
beer
overall
especially
on
a
hot
summer
day
drinkable
drinkable
in
the
way
water
is
drinkable
hey
if
you
are
the
type
of
ba
who
thinks
this
kind
of
beer
has
its
place
after
mowing
the
lawnthis
is
for
you
i
would
recommend
water
in
its
stead
my
favorite
brew
outo
f
mexico
for
sure
knocked
back
a
few
of
these
at
on
the
border
in
charleston
sc
while
visiting
friends
i
cant
believe
i
have
not
reviewed
this
beer
yet
since
it
is
my
go
to
beer
when
traveling
in
mexico
pours
a
nice
golden
yellow
color
with
a
thin
white
head
and
some
lacing
good
earthy
hop
aroma
with
faint
grainy
malts
in
the
background
very
clean
and
flavorful
perfect
accompliment
to
go
with
my
burritos
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
slight
white
head
that
fell
to

wish
to
apologize

the
bohemianbohemia
rhapsody
play
on
words
was
just
too
good
to
pass
up
truth
is
bohemia
is
one
fine
vienna
lager
and
is
a
damn
sight
better
than
either
dos

or
carta

looks
like
i
have
a
new
favorite
mexican
beer
salud
taste
is
light
malty
sweet
and
having

quiet

makes
this
brew
a
dinkable
beer
but
no
highflyer
much
better
than
you
standard
mexican
lager
not
quite
as
bland
as
corona
but
still
not
much
too
it
i
wouldnt

having
this

the

the

this
is
a
very
easy
drinking
beer
i
would
have
no
problem
ordering
this
one
again
consumed
in
october
2004
in
cancun
mexico
from
a
bottle
the
first
of
about
10
mexican
beers
i
am
going
to
review
from
notes
just
back
from
a
week
trip
to
cancun
plus
i
have
another
5
to
rate
that
i
brought
back
ok
smelled
decent
had
a
few
hops
lingering
around
maybe
a
sweet
flowery
fruity
flavor
hiding
in
the
background
poured
with
a
small
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
light
yellow
coloring
tasted
pretty
good
for
a
beer
from
mexico
maybe
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
a
lager
good
carbonation
a
few
light
hops
in
there
too
maybe
the
third
best
beer
i
had
back
there
refreshing
but
would
take
another
beer
i
like
over
it
anytime
worth
a
try
the
overall
feel
of
this
one
was
very
american
macro
crap
to
me
i
just
didnt
care
for
it
at
all
even
though
it
was
refreshing
if
i
wanted
refreshing
id
buy
aquafina
not
beer
the
water
is
cheaper
sinkability

this
one
lacks
substance
and
winded

in
the
pipes

with

that
leaves
a
some

clear
pale

color
light
bodied
and
light
carbonation
slightly

for
a
12oz
bottle
from
liquor
barn
lexington
ky
just
about
the
only
drinkable
beer
on
the
strip
in
acapulco
last
year
man
that
place
is
owned
by
corona
picked
up
a
bottle
when
i
got
home
to
confirm
my
impressions
the
head
is
big
white
fizzy
and
the
beer
is
a
clear
clear
pale
gold
spoonky
nose
crackers
a
little
fruit
the
front
is
a
little
spicy
interesting
with
a
touch
of
corn
syrup
fruity
sweetish
middle
and
lightly
nutty
finish
with
some
nice
hops
its
a
nice
light
fresh
lager
medium
gold
small
head
raises
and
falls
very
fast
skunks
grassy
malt
smell
flavor
has
a
lot
of
skunky
malt
but
also
hides
a
hefelike
banana
and
clove
flavor
also
a
little
metallic
body
is
very
thin
i
could
see
this
crap
getting
annoying
very
quickly
bohemia
is
one
of
the
better
southoftheborder
brews
availiable
almost
anywhere
around
in
houston
and
probably
the
u
s
appearance
is
a
decent
golden
head
is
fairly
small
smell
is
rather
weak
but
clean
mild
sweetness
is
noticible
taste
is
pretty
good
maybe
a
little
too
light
but
the
balance
is
just
about
right
complemented
my
enchiladas
nicely
this
is
easily
better
than
the
tecates
and
coronas
of
mexico
and
is
something
i
could
drink
quite
a
lot
of
in
the
future
probably
the
only
mexican
beer
that
id
rather
have
is
negra
modelo
interesting
beer
from
mexico
mildly
bitter
after
taste
with
overtones
of
roasted
hops
and
barley
and
just
a
touch
of
oats
flavor
medium
to
high
carbonation
with
a
medium
white
head
i
would
choose
this
over
many
other
mexican
brews
for
which
i
think
this
is
probably
the
best
beer
mexico
has
sent
across
the
boarder
beer
poured
a
pale
golden
color
the
head
was
present
during
the
pour
but
ceased
to
be
after
the
beer
was
in
the
glass
nose
was
grainy
with
a
wee
bit
of
a
sweet
smell
taste
was
rather
grassy
tastes
like
corn
and
biscuits
much
like
other
mexican
brews
had
a
hoppy
taste
to
it
towards
the
end
of
the
beer
mouthfeel
was
thin
thinner
than
i
like
but
it
was
good
for
this
beer
left
my
mouth
feeling
a
bit
oily
just
a
bit
not
a
bad
brew
nothing
to
get
excited
about
in
my
opinion
but
a
good
brew
nonetheless
surely
one
of
the
better
brews
from
mexico
looks
like
vernors
ginger
ale
darker
gold
to
copper
filled
with
carbonation
and
no
head
to
speak
of
sweet
malty
aroma
that
does
not
smell
like
corn
surprisingly
wow
i
think
there
may
be
some
hops
in
this
well
maybe
seems
to
finish
with
somewhat
of
a
hop
bite
maybe
hop
bitterness
and
maybe
even
some
even
indescernable
flavoring
hops
starts
crisp
and
light
little
bif
of
aftertaste
when
i
first
tried
this
i
though
it
was
great
im
glad
i
waited
until
my
second
try
to
rate
it
now
its
just
ok
modelo
especial
beats
this
overall
a
good
massproduced
mexican
lager
im
impressed
with
its
solid
yet
gentle
qualities
which
usually
fall
prey
to
money
hungry
beer
giants
nice
job
keeping
it
real
impressive
but
thin
i
had
this
while
eating
at
don
pablos
its
a
little
odd
that
this
is
a
mexican
beer
given
its
name
but
it
didnt
taste
like
most
mexican
beers
either
meaning
it
was
actually
good
the
pour
left
a
pale
bronze
color
with
a
small
to
medium
head
moderate
lacing
the
smell
was
a
combination
of
sweet
and
spicy
with
the
malts
hops
and
yeast
all
working
together
the
taste
began
with
a
grainy
flavor
but
i
didnt
get
much
of
the
huskiness
i
get
in
other
mexican
beers
the
hops
are
definitely
a
spicier
flavor
and
balance
out
the
grain
malts
really
well
the
body
on
this
beer
is
thicker
than
most
lagers
and
the
finish
is
very
thirst
quenching
it
matched
my
fajitas
really
well
drinkability
all
around
a
fine
pilsner
actually
very
close
to
greatness
had
it
tasted
like
it
smelled
there
is
definitely
some
of
the
corn
grain
taste
in
there
but
its
not
too
bad
it
finishes
like
a
relatively
classy
lager
it
feels
nice
in
the
mouth
and
is
really
drinkable
especially
in
warm
and
hot
weather
the
beer
poured
a
nice
clear
golden
pale
with
a
white
head
that
faded
quickly
and
leaves
no
lace
the
carbonation
was
up
that
provides
a
fiz
to
it
the
aroma
wasnt
strong
but
a
sweetcorn
grain
could
be
noticed
the
taste
starts
out
sweet
grain
grass
with
a
touch
of
corn
malt
and
hop
are
mild
very
drinkable
leaveing
the
mouth
a
slight
dry
feel
the
taste
was
very
enjoyable
very
sweet
with
lime
and
ginger
a
very
light
hint
of
caramel
too
maybe
the
maltiness
is
pretty
much
hidden
but
still
noticeable
which
i
found
interesting
for
a
mexican
beer
the
hops
leave
a
very
clean
mouthfeel
with
no
bitterness
this
beer
is
so
drinkable
it
was
perfect
with
mexican
food
its
a
good
session
beer
refreshing
clean
enjoyable
i
got
more
than
i
expected
this
is
a
staple
for
me
whenever
i
go
to
any
mexican
restaurant
it
is
actually
one
of
my
favorite
session
beers
it
pours
a
nice
clean
pale
golden
color
white
a
white
foam
head
smell
is
very
clean
as
is
the
taste
the
taste
is
complex
by
any
means
but
i
love
the
sweetish
clean
flavor
of
this
beer
very
inoffensive
mouthfeel
is
decent
as
is
drinkability
this
is
certainly
not
a
top
50
brew
but
id
never
turn
this
down
one
my
of
guilty
pleasures
super
drinkable
brew
sad
that
i
avoided
tasting
this
for
a
long
time
just
because
it
is
a
mexican
beer
poured
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
fizzy
white
head
composed
of
very
large
bubbles
smell
was
off
it
seemed
sour
staleand
like
something
unpleasant
had
been
burning
not
sure
what
it
was
the
taste
was
harsh
and
very
bitter
i
cant
tell
exactly
what
was
in
the
taste
but
it
clashed
no
real
things
i
could
identify
as
hops
or
malt
or
such
is
it
this
bad
or
is
this
one
skunked
pours
a
respectable
gold
with
a
fizzy
white
head
that
diminishes
almost
immediatly
smells
grainy
a
bit
of
citrus
a
little
skunky
taste
pretty
simple
clean
touch
of
corn
light
bitterness
matched
with
a
light
sweetness
pretty
bland
but
not
bad
decent
mouthfeel
a
bit
thin
but
when
matched
with
the
simple
flavor
it
is
refreshing
i
imagine
it
would
be
good
with
spicey
food
or
as
a
football
beer
its
alright
in
my
book
i
dont
know
what
it
is
about
mexico
that
they
think
they
make
a
descent
beer
this
beer
poured
out
very
light
in
color
it
didnt
produce
much
of
a
head
which
is
not
what
i
would
expect
from
a
lager
unfortunatly
the
flavor
of
this
beer
was
as
unimpressive
as
its
coloring
ive
read
that
when
eating
spicy
foods
you
should
drink
beer
that
has
a
high
abv
because
the
alcohol
is
what
cuts
the
heat
the
article
also
said
that
water
wont
rescue
you
from
the
fire
ive
never
been
to
mexico
but
you
know
what
they
say
dont
drink
the
bohemia
i
mean
water
had
this
last
night
at
el
nortes
a
very
good
mexican
eatery
in
middletown
ny
this
was
a
good
brew
better
than
corona
and
xx
pours
out
yellow
almost
amber
but
not
quite
with
a
thick
white
head
that
thins
out
and
leaves
a
very
fine
layer
on
the
top
smell
was
straight
up
hops
and
corn
taste
was
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
smell
except
for
a
bit
of
a
sweet
taste
thrown
in
very
drinkable
as
i
had
4
while
eating
my
chicken
enchilladas
of
all
the
beers
from
mexico
ive
tried
this
imo
is
one
of
the
better
ones
had
this
right
after
a
dos
equis
special
amber
and
a
modelo
dark
ale
and
this
beer
blew
the
xx
away
and
was
definitely
better
than
the
modelo
try
this
beer
out
youll
be
very
impressed
perhaps
the
finest
mexican
pilsnertype
beer
straw
color
pours
with
a
white
head
that
quickly
dissipates
to
a
thin
collar
of
foam
starts
just
a
bit
sweet
but
ends
with
a
nice
dash
of
spicy
hops
and
a
respectable
amount
of
bitterness
low
marks
for
appearance
at
least
if
this
supposed
to
be
a
viennastyle
lager
which
it
clearly
is
not
perhaps
im
reviewing
the
wrong
beer
a
very
nice
and
drinkable
lager
from
mexico
i
would
have
this
again
a
small
white
head
with
finelarge
bubbles
that
quickly
dissipated
the
body
was
clear
with
carbonation
observed
this
beers
hue
was
yellowgold
and
the
nose
was
malty
the
flavor
was
somewhat
bitter
and
lightly
hoppy
its
mouthfeel
was
tingly
thin
and
light
bodied
there
was
very
little
lacing
with
this
beer
in
my
opinion
there
is
nothing
that
really
stood
out
with
this
beer
and
it
was
rather
a
boring
beer
to
drink
and
rate
ng
anything
is
better
than
corona
this
is
maltier
than
typical
lagers
tastes
like
it
could
be
a
vienna
style
but
isnt
quite
as
sweet
dark
or
malted
as
many
of
those
brews
fast
fading
head
faintly
sweet
nose
and
flavor
a
bit
grainy
a
bit
more
beerlike
taste
than
the
other
15
or
so
that
i
sampled
in
mexico
overall
a
decent
brew
to
have
on
hand
when
eating
some
spicy
mexican
food
but
im
not
going
to
have
it
taking
up
space
in
my
fridge
otherwise
it
has
a
nice
strong
body
for
how
weak
this
beer
looks
a
nice
powerful
feel
in
the
mouth
i
recommend
this
beer
when
having
food
and
when
your
favorite
is
just
not
what
a
person
is
looking
for
at
the
time
very
enjoyable
lt
gold
color
with
a
foamy
medium
head
aroma
is
sweet
a
light
taste
lager
its
slightly
hoppy
crisp
taste
full
and
smooth
mouthfeel
finish
is
crisp
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
a
typical
mexicansouth
american
lager
lighter
tasting
beer
not
a
lot
of
flavor
but
it
is
light
and
refreshing
a
solid
beer
to
turn
to
with
mexican
food
in
fact
pretty
darn
good
all
on
its
own
this
blows
away
all
that
popular
mexican
swill
out
there
this
one
has
some
personality
and
doesnt
need
a
lemon
to
kick
it
up
a
notch
pleasant
malt
flavors
with
a
little
sweet
bread
dough
and
just
enough
bitterness
too
keep
it
interesting
a
safe
bet
for
your
fiesta
color
and
style
expectations
aside
this
beer
was
much
better
flavorwise
than
i
expected
i
found
no
offflavors
from
corn
rice
grain
husks
etc
in
here
easy
to
drink
altogether
probably
one
of
the
best
nondark
beers
from
mexico
mouthfeel
and
taste
average
pretty
average
beer
just
once
id
like
a
mexican
beer
to
blow
me
away
i
went
to
a
local
mexican
restaurant
and
decided
to
try
this
beer
with
my
meal
it
poured
a
very
light
straw
with
a
minimal
head
the
head
evaporated
almost
instantly
and
the
beer
looked
flat
about
halfway
through
the
glass
the
beer
had
just
enough
maltiness
in
the
aroma
and
the
taste
to
let
me
know
i
was
drinking
a
beer
and
not
a
glass
of
water
the
mouthfeel
was
very
light
and
low
carbonation
this
made
an
okay
beer
for
a
mexican
food
place
or
maybe
watching
a
ballgame
it
could
make
a
good
session

thin

with

i
dont
know
if
my
taste
buds
were
off
or
what
but
the
flavor
exhibited
an
unexpected
fruitiness
to
it
light
malt
and
grain
flavors
lead
into
a
somewhat
dry
finish
overall
pretty
bland
i
expected
a
little
more
here
pales
in
comparison
to
dos
equis
amber
cheers
the
brewer
should
shout
the
origin
on
the
label
this
is
a
decently
put
together
brew
worthy
of
its
name
a
good
food
beer
it
would
range
through
the
spice
spectrum
quite
well
color
is
golden
yellow
and
a
bit
pale
with
a
white
head
that
went
out
fast
leaving
some
patchy
lace
smells
of
lightly
done
malt
with
faint
hop
taste
is
mostly
sweet
malt
very
clean
with
barely
a
hop
noticed
feel
is
medium
bodied
and
easy
smooth
and
refreshing
this
is
a
better
mexican
lager
then
most
medium
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
which
disappears
in
seconds
good
lace
and
lots
of
fizzy
carbonation
aroma
has
just
a
hint
of
skunk
slight
malt
and
mild
floral
hops
taste
begins
with
slightly
sweet
bread
malts
which
are
quickly
subsumed
by
earthymedicinal
hop
flavors
that
linger
past
the
end
of
the
taste
finish
is
crisp
nd
dry
mouthfeel
is
quite
good
for
the
style
this
beer
pairs
very
well
with
spicy
foods
and
is
quite
refreshing
in
and
of
itself
among
the
better
of
classical
mexican
beers
i
dont
particularly
like
this
style
of
beer
so
i
probably
wont
be
buying
it
again
but
i
would
definitely
not
have
a
problem
drinking
another
one
if
it
was
available
overall
this
would
be
an
easy
to
drink
beer
for
even
the
pickiest
of
beer
advocates
this
is
your
average
mexican
beer
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
if
that
makes
any
sense
i
have
had
this
on
numerous
occasions
and
i
still
enjoy
it
as
much
as
the
first
time
i
had
it
it
has
a
light
initial
taste
but
finishes
off
with
a
semistouty
taste
its
darker
than
most
mexican
beers
so
it
has
some
body
to
it
and
doesnt
need
a
fruit
to
make
it
good
my
good
friends
from
college
the
coastas
named
so
because
they
were
from
coasta
rica
brought
me
to
it
they
also
gave
me
a
cool
little
recipe
that
they
use
in
costa
rica
w
bohemia
take
one
bottle
of
it
mix
it
with
a
couple
dashes
of
hot
sauce
and
a
couple
dashes
of
lime
juice
you
have
to
trust
me
on
this
one
itll
make
you
sweat
but
you
just
want
even
more
the
tastes
mix
together
wonderfully
give
it
a
shot
and
you
wont
be
disappointed
by
far
this
is
the
best
beer
from
mexico
that
i
have
ever
had
it
actually
tastes
like
beer
shame
on
you
corona
et
al
this
beer
is
not
going
to
tax
your
tastebuds
but
it
is
a
decent
drink
i
bet
is
would
go
good
with
spicy
foods
bright
gold
color
sudsy
falling
head
aromas
of
clear
grain
and
welljudged
hops
and
husk
the
palate
features
a
nice
balance
of
creamy
fine
fizzy
texture
malty
medium
body
and
again
welljudged
bitterness
bright
lemon
battles
with
wet
earth
finishes
clean
and
dry
certainly
the
best
mexican
light
lager
i
can
easily
get
my
hands
on
and
in
the
more
general
austalasianhelleslager
category
one
of
the
best
as
well
not
nearly
as
bad
as
i
was
expecting
as
far
as
the
mexican
beers
i
have
tried
so
far
it
is
not
quite
as
good
as
negro
modelo
but
is
mucho
better
than
corona
tecate
etc
light
malt
flavor
aroma
is
hard
to
comment
on
because
all
i
could
smell
was
the
lime
all
in
all
i
would
probably
try
this
again
as
it
went
with
my
enchiladas
fairly
well
pours
a
clear
gold
the
head
white
minimal
the
lace
is
adequate
nose
is
malt
clean
and
crisp
front
is
malt
lightly
sweet
top
is
light
the
finish
is
quite
acidic
dry
and
nicely
hopped
the
second
beer
i
had
in
warez
mexico
on
my
first
weekend
at
my
new
posting
to
fort
bliss
ranks
937
on
my
current
1000
beer
master
list
this
is
my
top
pale
mexican
beer
without
a
doubt
pours
an
extremely
clear
pale
yellow
so
pale
it
resembles
white
wine
the
1
12
finger
head
dissipates
very
quickly
the
smell
as
well
as
the
taste
is
that
of
a
very
faint
sweetness
it
finishes
almost
in
a
disappointing
way
leaves
you
high
and
dry
so
to
speak
the
mouthfeel
is
barely
more
refined
than
water
i
feel
like
i
could
drink
alot
of
these
but
could
a
stand
repeated
high
and
dry
episodes
is
the
big
question
it
went
okay
with
the
food
but
the
food
outdid
the
beer
think
ill
try
the
dos
xx
next
salud
notes
before
anyone
says
anything
yes
this
is
a
viennastyle
lager
there
are
quite
a
few
mexican
lagers
that
are
but
thats
a
history
lesson
within
itself
back
to
the
beer
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
massproduced
mexican
lagers
available
just
had
one
of
these
with
a
rice
bean
and
cheese
burrito
covered
in
peppermash
salsa
it
quenched
quelled
and
complemented
quite
nicely
typical
pilsner
appearance
straw
hue
and
perfectly
clear
lemony
and
floral
hop
nose
perhaps
from
tettanger
malt
notes
are
surpsingly
absent
in
the
aroma
light
in
carbonation
for
a
pilsner
hop
bitterness
is
mild
and
malt
sweetness
thus
dominates
lemon
zest
hop
flavor
followed
by
a
hint
of
graininess
nothing
outstanding
in
flavor
but
the
lack
of
flaws
and
clean
finish
to
this
beer
make
it
innocuous
and
drinkable
its
not
a
beer
to
savor
by
itself
it
needs
greasy
food
lighter
malt
aroma
that
adds
nicely
to
the
drink
nice
full
head
clear
light
gold
color
taste
is
a
little
drier
than
many
in
style
but
not
sharp
or
bitter
which
i
think
is
why
it
goes
so
well
with
many
foods
good
mouth
feel
without
excessive
carbonation
a
satisfying
lager
slightly
hazy
golden
hue
with
a
thin
head
foam
dies
quickly
and
doesnt
leave
any
lace
earthy
hops
in
the
nose
and
a
medium
body
and
fairly
full
mouthfeel
tastes
great
with
some
actual
hop
assertiveness
solid
and
unspectacular
too
bad
american
mass
producers
cant
come
up
with
something
similar
to
this
pilsener
it
would
kick
the
crap
out
of
our
current
options
for
quality
lager
my
favorite
mexican
beer
although
i
only
had
a
few
better
then
dos
equis
and
it
smashes
corona
i
thought
it
was
very
crisp
it
had
clean
finish
it
went
very
well
w
my
prime
rib
steak
chili
this
is
my
favorite
mexican
beer
when
we
first
started
roadtripping
to
mexico
as
youngsters
we
drank
corona
because
it
was
everywhere
once
i
discovered
bohemia
i
never
went
back
it
tastes
great
icy
cold
on
the
beach
or
with
carne
asada
for
dinner
you
can
actually
tase
hops
in
this
beer
my
second
favorite
mexican
behind
negro
madelo
pretty
good
south
of
the
border
beer
nothing
special
but
decent
body
and
sufficient
hops
to
do
the
job
its
an
old
bottle
and
my
palate
is
on
the
mend
but
it
has
nice
character
that
shines
through
an
outstanding
american
pils
a
start
your
night
kinda
beer
high
b
exceptionally
flavorful
and
well
balanced
with
a
medium
hop
bitterness
and
pils
malt
softness
dominating
the
finish
is
off
dry
an
overall
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
and
a
great
example
of
the
style
pours
a
clear
straw
color
with
a
small
white
foam
head
that
dissipates
quickly
leaves
a
little
bit
of
lacing
not
too
much
going
on
the
aroma
wheat
with
faint
spices
and
orange
and
lemon
zest
the
taste
is
so
incredibly
wonderfully
balanced
something
ng
has
mastered
some
of
their
beers
may
be
a
little
more
subtle
but
man
do
they
do
it
well
some
really
pleasant
wheat
a
little
bit
of
grassiness
and
some
nice
orange
and
lemon
notes
a
small
amount
of
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste
really
easy
to
drink
crisp
and
refreshing
perfect
drink
for
the
end
of
the
summer
well
carbonated
overall
another
excellent
entry
by
new
glarus
may
need
to
update
this
later
but
so
far
this
beer
is
living
up
to
expectations
with
lots
of
clean
grassy
hop
aroma
a
buttload
of
crispness
and
the
right
amount
of
grassycitrusyherbal
flavor
and
bitterness
on
the
back
end
the
extremely
pale
yellow
color
might
put
some
off
but
that
would
be
a
shame
too
bad
they
did
not
release
this
earlier
in
the
summer
at
least
i
didnt
notice
until
september
for
it
would
make
an
ideal
warm
afternoon
quencher
not
a
fan
of
the
style
but
surprisingly
enjoyable
love
the
hop
character
a
very
welldone
truetostyle
germanstyle
pils
very
enjoyable
and
easytodrink
overall
it
is
incredible
to
me
how
new
glarus
can
make
some
many
lagers
that
carry
a
familiar
yeast
profile
yet
the
surrounding
characters
are
so
different
and
complex
and
create
completely
different
beers
certainly
the
king
of
lagering
in
the
midwest
and
in
my
opinion
in
the
running
against
anyone
anywhere
they
execute
their
styles
so
masterfully
well
done
dan
wow
i
love
this
beer
i
have
always
looked
forward
to
the
release
of
this
this
is
the
2nd
or
3rd
release
i
have
had
and
man
this
always
lets
me
know
what
a
american
brewery
can
do
with
a
pilsner
mouthfeel
is
crisp
refreshing
and
light
a
fair
amount
of
hop
oils
and
resin
balance
the
body
o
this
is
well
done
and
im
happy
to
be
a
wisconsin
resident
for
easy
access
to
beers
like
this
reviewed
6407
o
pretty
typical
german
style
lager
the
hops
are
the
star
which
is
standard
for
the
style
nothing
mind
blowing
o
im
not
really
big
on
pilsners
but
i
could
drink
this
all
day
really
well
balanced
and
just
plain
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
damn
fine
beer
and
mad
drinkable
to
boot
o
i
am
not
much
of
a
pilsner
connoisseur
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
this
take
is
the
most
balanced
and
delicious
take
on
the
style
i
have
had
to
date
extremely
well
balanced
a
delicious
bready
pilsner
featuring
sweet
malt
flavors
and
an
excellent
hop
backbone
overall
a
pretty
nicely
done
take
on
a
pilsner
nice
bready
pils
taste
with
a
solid
hop
backing
o
excellent
well
bittered
pilsner
but
still
with
a
backbone
of
malt
as
the
bottle
says
a
great
relaxed
drinker
from
new
glarus
pours
a
golden
yellow
stalk
like
color
nose
is
sweet
cereal
malts
with
a
nice
caramel
malts
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
taste
starts
off
with
citrus
lemon
these
move
on
to
a
grainy
malt
flavor
and
are
finished
off
by
some
spicy
grassy
hops
like
most
of
their
beers
really
soft
mouthfeel
smooth
and
full
taboot
overall
this
is
a
nice
lightly
hopped
pilsner
props
to
ng
for
brewing
a
really
nice
pilsner
pours
gold
fizzy
bubbles
thick
white
head
active
translucent
retention
and
lacing
big
pilsy
smell
quite
german
and
minerals
too
crisp
taste
light
lemon
balanced
hop
refreshing
great
pils
nails
the
style
bursts
with
flavor
but
simple
and
drinkable
spot
on
picked
up
a
single
at
casanova
in
hudson
wi
its
dry
crisp
and
hoppy
what
a
nice
example
of
a
german
pilsner
the
aroma
is
a
little
hoppier
than
a
beer
straight
from
the
motherland
but
thats
by
no
means
a
bad
thing
the
hops
are
herbal
and
grassy
upfront
with
mild
kicks
of
lemon
and
grapefruit
the
malt
jumps
out
from
behind
the
hops
with
mix
of
doughy
and
toasty
bread
notes
a
delicious
beer
it
reminds
me
of
a
more
traditional
and
more
drinkable
version
of
victorys
prima
pils
the
finish
is
biting
and
a
little
rough
like
youd
expect
from
a
healthy
helping
of
euro
hops

prima

my
new
favorite
in
this
style
class
i
love
this
i
buy
this
on
purpose
i
pass
up
buying
hop
bombs
ipas
pale
ales
and
all
sorts
of
elaborate
brews
to
take
this
home
and
it
still
never
disappoints
this
beer
is
truly
impressive
im
not
thrilled
with
the
taste
but
everything
else
about
it
is
darn
good
and
the
mouthfeel
is
about
the
best
ive
encountered
in
any
beer
any
style
just
like
that
its
gone
i
plan
to
drink
a
whole
lot
of
this
come
next
summer
this
is
a
great
fall
beer
for
me
and
a
reminder
of
how
much
the
style
has
to
offer
when
its
done
right
o
overall
its
always
great
to
be
able
to
depend
on
a
brewery
like
new
glarus
to
deliver
a
solid
to
great
beer
highly
drinkable
and
sessionable
while
still
providing
good
flavors
and
smoothness
o
overall
a
slightly
above
average
pilsner
not
bad
at
all
but
not
a
ton
going
on
to
be
honest
kind
of
surprised
by
the
high
score
easy
drinking
and
better
than
most
light
beers
but
otherwise
nothing
special
probably
my
least
favorite
ng
beer
to
date
overall
i
like
this
beer
it
is
a
very
solid
example
of
american
micro
pilsener
the
bottle
says
germanstyle
brew
i
would
not
expect
anything
less
from
new
glarus
though
even
with
that
said
they
really
nailed
it
here
close
to
perfection
for
the
style
puts
many
of
the
imported
counterparts
to
shame

not
what
i
expected
from
a
pilsner
style
beer
o
allaround
just
an
excellent
lager
somewhat
reminiscent
of
the
amber
landbiers
that
one
can
find
in
remote

in

exceptional

exceptional
lager
a

well
balanced

i
had
this
on
tap
and
in
the
bottle
the
tap
seems
to
give
this
one
more
life
if
that
makes
sense
i
am
not
very
good
at
writing
reviews
but
i
have
sampled
enough
beers
to
know
a
great
one
when
i
taste
it
and
as
far
as
lagers
go
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
o
great
offering
from
new
glarus
must
try
little
heavier
than
other
german
pilsners
i
would
say
ill
skip
the
real
review
but
need
to
mention
theres
an
amazingly
striking
lemon
juice
element
that
fronts
this
flavor
profile
be
the
instant
hit
of
backyard
bbqs
by
bringing
a
case
of
this
lager
it
was
a
little
bit
above
average
the
lager
i
have
the
most
in
my
fridge
so
solid
for
summer
months
when
its
hot
good
beer
excellent
smell
color
great
body
awesome
taste
overall
drinkability
a
very
tasty
lager
and
one
that
i
could
easily
drink
another
of
i
wish
i
had
a
six
pack
of
this
as
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
but
i
got
this
one
bottle
as
a
gift
so
it
will
be
awhile
before
i
can
locate
another
overall
a
well
crafted
pilsnerlager
but
not
as
hoppy
as
i
would
have
expected
for
a
german
pilsner
the
malt
is
the
theme
for
this
beer
and
it
shows
nicely
this
beer
went
very
well
with
food
chicken
schnitzel
green
beans
and
i
think
it
would
go
very
well
with
a
wider
range
of
food
as
well
a
great
overall
lager
slightly
hazy
medium
golden
color
with
a
decent
head
aromas
of
rich
sweet
bready
pilsner
malt
with
hints
of
light
fruit
and
extremely
faint
floral
hops
sweet
bready
maltiness
without
much
to
provide
balance
fruity
flavor
seems
out
of
place
in
a
clean
lager
easy
enough
to
drink
but
needs
some
tweaking
solid
lager
no
technical
flaws
it
would
be
nice
if
the
beer
had
some
more
hops
the
malt
profile
is
enjoyable
and
the
yeast
created
a
nice
mellow
smooth
beer
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
mamas
little
yellow
pils
medium
body
and
carbonation
its
probably
a
terrific
lager
but
im
not
a
fan
of
the
style
and
this
one
is
very
maltforward
bad
news
for
a
hoplover
like
me
it
certainly
has
much
more
flavor
than
your
runofthe
mill
massproduced
lager
it
has
a
fairly
deep
golden
coloring
with
lots
of
lacing
on
the
pour
poured
from
a
12
oz
bottle
into
a
pint
glass

with
a
fluffy

barely
slight

of
fruit
especially
berries
nice
grain
and
fruit
balance
beer
is
light
bodied
with
good
carbonation
overall
a
very
good
beer
this
one
goes
down
pretty
easy
and
it
is
nice
to
see
a
lager
that
stays
true
to
its
roots
on
our
way
through
rt
90
across
the
great
midwest
wisconsin
was
a
gem
of
a
state
after
countless
hours
of
sd
tourist
trap
desperation
our
very
first
wi
gas
stop
produced
a
store
with
a
full
aisle
of
new
glarus
cheese
and
meat
sticks
after
days
of
wyoming
evil
eyes
and
south
dakota
biker
madness
wisconsin
was
amazing
my
first
purchase
was
a
mixed
12er
of
new
glarus
that
included
two
women
lager
i
have
to
be
honest
i
wasnt
expecting
a
lot
after
a
couple
bottles
of
spotted
cow
but
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
this
one
pours
a
little
darker
than
your
average
pils
and
has
a
very
pleasant
soft
malt
flavor
the
hops
are
understated
but
i
dont
feel
like
this
is
a
nouveauamerican
pils
with
a
blast
of
spicy
european
hops
i
like
that
but
im
enjoying
the
mellowed
feel
of
this
beer
it
may
not
be
flashy
but
this
is
a
rock
solid
beer
worthy
of
attention
id
happily
host
a
bbq
with
a
few
of
these
classic
german
pilsner
not
at
all
what
i
expected
from
reading
the
label
and
description
overall
nice
aroma
and
mouth
feel
not
much
staying
power
of
the
hops
at
the
finish
did
take
me
back
to
my
travels
in
germany
will
try
again

great

either

o

glarus
two
women
has
a
great
story
behind
it
representing
two
craft
beer
companies
run
by
women
in
a
maledominated
industry
but
i
think
with
all
his
talent
dan
could
do
a
little
better
with
this
beer
balanced
hopping
brings
the
tasty
malts
to
a
very
clean
and
drinkable
level
but
i
find
the
lack
of
carbonation
to
give
the
beer
a
somewhat
slick
and
flat
feel
its
not
quite
lively
enough
which
would
coincidentally
reflect
debs
personality
well

fantastic
lager
the
best
that
i
have
ever
had
it
has
a
beautiful
crystal
clear
coppery
color
smells
and
tastes
very
smooth
it
has
a
rich
dark
color
but
a
light
body
great
for
summer
there
is
a
very
low
bitterness
just
enough
to
complement
the
malts
cant
say
enough
good
about
this
lagered
sweetheart
of
a
beer
overall
a
marvelous
craft
lager
from
new
glarus
a
brewing
company
well
known
for
their
traditional
styles
this
is
a
good
us
produced
german
pilsner
but
i
would
have
liked
to
see
a
more
significantly
bitter
brew
to
make
it
truly
oldworld
in
style
nonetheless
for
lager
lovers
this
is
a
must
try
two
women
is
a
really
well
crafted
beer
its
straightforward
satisfying
and
off
the
charts
drinkable
clean
and
crisp
this
is
a
beer
i
find
myself
buying
each
and
every
time
i
head
up
north
taste
is
delicious
and
wellbalanced
malts
dominate
naturally
but
there
is
a
nice
and
fruity
citrus
hops
edge
in
here
near
the
finish
exemplary
for
the
style
and
a
superior
lager
o
absolutely
delicious
lagerpils
such
low
community
ratings
for
this
beer
confirms
ba
rube
bias
against
lagers
as
a
genre
overall
very
nice
yearround
lager
nothing
i
didnt
expect
from
new
glarus
its
a
nice
mix
of
märzen
and
czech
pilsner
o
an
excellent
lager
with
distinctive
aroma
and
flavor
cant
wait
to
have
this
again
would
love
to
pair
it
with
a
snitzel
omuch
better
than
it
smelled
nothing
special
but
for
a
style
im
not
usually
fond
of
this
was
decent
for
me
this
would
be
a
better
summer
sessionable
brew
very
easy
drinking
as
i
believe
pilsners
should
be
great
example
of
a
pilsner
there
is
a
sweetness
there
though
that
may
prevent
me
from
drinking
too
much
ill
have
to
get
more
to
really
put
my
finger
er
tongue
on
it
this
is
a
light
bodied
brew
with
a
modest
amount
of
carbonation
this
seems
like
a
brew
caught
between
a
marzen
and
a
czech
pils
but
leaning
more
towards
marzen
not
bad
but
not
great
either
overall
im
not
a
german
pilsener
fan
at
all
but
this
beer
i
am
a
big
fan
of
thats
all
there
is
to
it
overall
pretty
solid
german
style
pilsner
from
wi
wish
i
had
more
a
nicely
balanced
easydrinking
sessionable
lager
a
very
enjoyable
pilsner
but
a
bit
too
nut
brown
ale
leaning
i
say
this
without
hesitation
this
is
the
best
lager
ive
ever
had
easy
to
drink
and
doesnt
fill
you
up
a
perfect
session
beer
o
this
beer
is
very
clean
with
hints
of
malt
and
hops
but
not
much
else
this
pours
a
rich
caramel
color
with
generous
foam
it
has
a
light
maltysweet
caramel
aroma
that
gives
way
to
a
delicately
bodied
slightly
sweet
ale
with
a
hint
of
caramel
two
women
is
a
pleasing
session
ale
i
did
not
think
of
this
as
a
pilsner
while
sipping
however
overall
a
superb
pils
one
of
the
best
ive
ever
had
o
a
crisp
clean
hoppy
german
lager
ng
does
the
style
well
but
personally
i
like
the
sweetness
to
be
a
little
more
subdued
its
not
over
powering
by
any
means
just
a
personal
preference
on
the
style
being
more
balanced
o
this
is
a
solid
lager
no
characteristics
make
it
stick
out
as
amazing
but
it
was
a
good
drink
o
while
it
goes
down
pretty
easy
when
cold
this
brew
still
reminds
me
of
something
that
belongs
in
a
green
twistoff
bottle
its
something
in
between
bmc
and
boster
lager
which
i
realize
is
a
large
spectrum
but
for
me
everything
on
this
side
of
the
lager
scale
just
showcases
why
this
isnt
my
favorite
style
still
a
fine
offering
and
a
good
brew
for
what
it
is
amber
in
color
with
great
clarity
minimal
foam
on
the
top
lively
carbonation
simple
aroma
of
pale
malt
and
lager
yeast
dominate
the
aroma
the
mouthfeel
is

the
flavor
showcases
the
malt
and
is
meant
to
be
pretty
laid

o
this
would
make
a
good

beer
or
lawnmower
beer
it
is
easy
drinking
but
not
a
lot
of
flavor
i
could
have
this
as
an
everyday
beer
this
is
the
fourth
of
6
new
glarus
beers
not
dissapointed
in
any
overall
probably
my
favorite
pilsner
i
remember
having
this
brew
early
in
my
craft
beer
career
and
having
it
stand
out
a
truly
wonderful
beer
one
to
search
out
and
find
o
all
around
very
drinkable
beer
that
is
good
any
time
of
the
year
o
a
great
beer
i
can
drink
a

of
these
awesome

that
has

will
drink

thanks
to
my
friend
from
rockford
il
for
the
2
women
sample
this
beer
is
everything
that
a
solid
lager
can
be
to
me
it
represents
the
simple
yet
fresh
and
enjoyable
taste
that
can
be
created
with
water
malt
hops
and
yeast
it
has
a
full
rich
taste
profile
and
goes
well
with
just
about
any
food
from
nachos
to
burgers
so
easy
to
drink
i
will
gladly
have
this
brew
again
low
c
toasty

forward
toasty

mix
up
with

on
the
finish
pretty
good
carbonation
bubbling
on
the
tongue
too
crisp
malty
but
well
balanced
and
very
easy
to
drink
would
be
a
regular
go
to
beer
if
i
could
get
my
hands
on
it
in
il
pours
tan
with
a
high
fluffy
white
head
way
darker
than
any
pilsner
ive
seen
the
smell
is
bread
dough
and
green
grass
with
something
sharp
and
almost
spicy
in
it
the
taste
is
rich
and
doughy
with
some
savory
notes
going
into
a
bitter
twinge
at
the
end
its
a
little
thick
highly
carbonated
all
in
all
this
is
a
very
good
lager
but
i
dont
buy
it
as
a
pilsner
more
like
a
dortmunder
or
even
a
bock
id
drink
it
if
i
saw
it
again
and
gladly
but
its
not
at
all
to
style
overall
ok
beer
straightforward
but
enjoyable
for
what
it
is
dont
get
me
wrong
this
is
a
very
good
brew
but
its
not
new
glaruss
typical
level
of
stellar
o
a
very
nice
beer
i
have
never
had
a
german
pilsner
or
not
that
i
know
of
so
comparing
styles
is
a
hard
one
for
me
this
is
a
very
clean
crisp
and
refreshing
beer
not
a
very
light
beer
but
something
that
would
be
nice
on
a
warm
spring
day
overall
a
nice
lager
beer
and
a
good
choice
for
sessioning
not
your
typical
pilsner
fairly
light
in
mouthfeel
but
the
darker
malts
and
unclean
fruity
character
add
more
complexity
than
anticipated
well
done
this
beer
is
crisp
and
clean
much
closer
to
a
vienna
lager
it
very
creamy
and
rich
on
the
mouthfeel
the
hops
give
it
nice
bitterness
that
i
didnt
think
i
would
like
but
it
fits
the
beer
very
well
i
can
crush
this
beer
all
day
long
while
watching
a
football
game
had
this
back
to
back
with
home
town
blonde
and
this
is
smoother
while
also
far
less
hoppy
and
crisp
this
tastes
closer
to
a
vienna
lager
by
my
palate
the
barley
is
almost
creamy
with
subtle
caramel
and
toffee
you
might
even
mistake
it
for
an
irish
red
the
hops
just
provide
balancing
bitterness
to
this
amber
lager
maybe
i
taste
a
touch
of
citrus
in
the
finish
i
cant
say
for
certain
as
it
warms
i
get
a
touch
of
grass
in
the
aroma
theres
a
little
fruit
but
i
think
its
coming
from
the
malt
this
is
an
easydrinking
crowdpleaser
but
also
a
finelycrafted
lager
its
closer
to
spotted
cow
than
home
town
i
really
like
this
beer
startlingly
refreshing
crisp
clean
spiciness
is
delicate
pleasant
but
could
be
a
bit
higher
just
an
allaround
good
pilsener
o
definitely
one
of
the
stronger
entries
in
this
style
class
that
ive
tried
new
glarus
does
it
again
overall
a
very
good
all
around
take
on
a
germain
style
pilsener
good
bready
malts
with
a
nice
soft

kick
and

the

another
good
beer
from
them
o
pilseners
arent
my
favorite
beer
in
the
world
but
this
one
was
very
well
done
for
the
style
for
the
style
there
was
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
and
aroma
and
is
much
better
then
most
of
the
massproduced
pilseners
that
tend
to
dominate
the
style
if
you
like
lagers
i
definitely
recommend
trying
this
out
but
not
going
out
of
your
way
to
seek
it
pours
golden
with
a
solid
sheet
of
fine
white
foam
a
little
dark
for
the
style
smells
of
apple
grain
crsytal
malt
some
sweet
corn
and
some
bits
of
bitter
noble
hops
taste
is
smooth
with
some
apple
juice
some
metal
some
grain
and
bits
of
white
grape
juice
over
hay
and
standard
lager
flavors
thin
with
low
carb
and
a
semi
dry
yet
wet
finish
an
okay
beer
very
drinkable
but
lacks
the
assertiveness
and
lightness
a
fine
pilsner
should
have
this
is
a
lager
but
not
a
pilsner
o
this
is
a
really
tasty
pilsner
but
im
not
sure
how
well
it
fits
the
german
pilsner
mold
good
german
pilsners
are
very
pale
and
have
a
touch
of
grainy
malts
but
most
of
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
is
dominated
by
bitter
hops
this
particular
beer
as
evidenced
by
the
color
has
a
much
stronger
malt
presence
than
is
indicated
dont
get
me
wrong
its
still
a
really
good
and
drinkable
beer
however
i
think
it
would
fit
better
in
the
bohemian
pilsner
category
after
checking
new
glarus
website
i
cant
fault
them
on
trueness
to
style
even
on
the
appearance
since
they
list
the
beer
as
a
classic
country
lager
the
german
pilsner
is
probably
just
the
ba
category
that
it
happened
to
be
boxed
into
regardless
of
any
of
that
nonsense
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
nice
job
new
glarus
everything
i
look
for
in
a
great
pils
notes
really
enjoyable
albeit
different
pilsener
darker
and
slightly
different
flavors
than
what
i
expected
hop
profile
is
dead
on
and
very
tasty
also
the
hops
have
a
significant
presencebite
here
really
enjoyable
and
easy
to
drink
beer
recommended
i
wasnt
sure
what
to
make
of
this
lager
at
first
but
the
label
and
description
get
the
taste
buds
going
thanks
to
dave
for
bringing
this
down
in
the
sampler
pack
new
glarus
made
another
stellar
beer
crazy
good
malts
and
a
deft
use
of
noble
hopping
drinks
like
a
champ
do
they
have
enough
summer
in
wisconsin
to
drink
this
many
delicious
summerlawnmower
beers
who
cares
drink
it
overall
a
nice
malty
and
light
treat
i
like
the
caramel
and
the
complexity
of
this
one
i
would
certainly
have
this
stocked
in
my
fridge
if
i
could
get
it
easily
o
the
munich
malts
in
this
beer
reminded
me
much
more
of
a
german
oktoberfest
the
color
through
me
off
a
bit
also
the
cinnamon
i
perceive
gives
the
beer
complexity
yet
nowhere
near
stole
the
show
the
beer
tasted
fantastic
but
i
find
it
difficult
categorizing
the
creative
twists
this
offers
i
scored
the
beer
well
because
i
recognize
this
beer
is
intentionally
brewed
out
of
style
and
i
appreciate
the
craft
exemplified
d
very
easy
drink
pleasant
roasted
malt
taste
a
fantastic
lager
experience
overall
a
great
german
lager
not
boring
at
all
wonderful
option
here
from
new
glarus
for
a
hot
summer
day
that
you
are
out
being
active
you
can
tell
that
dan
carey
learned
how
to
brew
in
germany
this
is
solid
and
enjoyable
drinks
well
cheers
medium
mouthfeel
kinda
grassy
tasting
with
emphasis
on
malt
also
finishes
a
tad
on
the
sour
side
smells
plain
slight
grassy
earthy
notes
on
the
nose
and
palate
typical
sulfur
notes
like
most
lagers
really
refreshing
better
than
most
lagers
not
very
remarkable
otherwise
not
bad
by
any
means
great
summer
beer
overall
i
find
this
to
be
an
exceptional
lager
one
of
the
better
ive
had
its
not
a
pilsner
but
its
not
an
amber
either
this
is
what
a
good
lager
should
be
drinkable
but
with
a
few
layers
of
flavor
many
lagers
are
very
onedimensional
but
not
two
women
im
not
a
huge
pilsner
or
even
amber
lager
fan
but
this
one
kinda
changes
that
i
would
definitely
drink
this
one
again
would
love
to
try
it
on
tap
recommended
to
any
who
can
get
it
cheers
o
this
is
really
tasty
and
very
well
made
definitely
enjoyed
it
a
lot
overall
a
classic
lager
beer
pretty
well
done
i
wont
be
returning
to
it
though
not
for
me
i
wont
turn
down
a
good
classic
lager

gave

its

no

no

i
love

im
giving
this
a
5
overall
because
its
such
a
fresh
this
beer
pours
a
dark
bronze
color
the
head
is
one
inch
in
height
and
recedes
slowly
into
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
toast
hints
of
light
toffee
and
a
splash
of
spicy
noble
hops
the
taste
is
very
well
balanced
with
a
bunch
of
toasty
malt
and
ample
hops
there
is
also
a
very
faint
metallic
note
in
the
background
that
adds
to
the
flavor
the
mouthfeel
is
medium
bodied
with
a
smooth
texture
and
fairly
high
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
really
good
pilsener
that
i
will
surely
drink
again
when
the
opportunity
presents
itself
palate
mirrors
the
aroma
though
its
a
bit
less
sweet
than
the
nose
implies
though
still
plenty
malty
crusty
bread
and
caramel
dark
fruit
faint
sulfur
from
the
yeast
medium
bodied
fairly
hefty
for
a
5
abv
lager
clean
malty
finish
not
much
bitterness
or
bite
enjoyable
stuff
but
not
my
favorite
new
glarus
lager
i
recall
liking
it
more
from
the
large
format
bottle
though
it
seems
like
a
different
beer
now
o
a
really
clean
and
delicious
lager
great
stuff
overall
another
exceptional
lager
from
new
glarus
the
titans
of
easydrinking
beer
while
im
not
usually
a
lager
person
i
really
enjoyed
this
o
a
fantastic
all
around
session
beer
when
you
dont
want
to
sacrifice
substance
for
drinkabliity
o
nice
session
lager
and
one
i
hope
to
try
again
to
my
mind
this
yearround
bottled
version
of
the
r
d
beer
is
a
little
bit
different
than
the
original
a
little
bit
darker
in
color
and
a
just
little
bit
sweeter
and
overall
its
slightly
better
than
average
for
the
style
of
course
there
are
some
very
impressive
and
authentic
renditions
of
the
pilsener
style
out
there
from
the
craft
brewers
these
days
so
this
is
by
no
means
an
average
american
beer
in
this
respect
rather
better
than
average
for
a
germanstyle
pilsener
is
a
very
good
thing
to
my
mind
o
i
didnt
have
very
high
expectations
for
this
beer
but
it
easily
exceeded
them
i
dont
mind
a
lager
every
so
often
say
once
a
month
but
two
women
is
something
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
all
the
time
especially
during
the
summer
ng
has
crafted
a
great
beer
here
kudos
drinkable
by
the
gallons
and
a
near
masterpiece
for
some
summer
pilsener
drinkin
new
glarus
has
a
big
time
keeper
with
this
stuff
d
highly
drinkable
though
maybe
the
tostyle
carbonation
is
too
much
for
me
to
have
to
many
overall
it
is
a
very
good
easy
drinking
beer
for
this
summer
its
well
balanced
and
put
together
very
well
a
german
pils
it
is
not
but
as
a
dark
american
lager
this
thing
is
outstanding
i
rather
like
the
malt
profile
while
i
personally
would
like
a
touch
more
bitterness
to
finish
this
beer
out
the
hops
does
its
job
i
like
it
flavor
speaks
to
the
pilsener
style
with
an
easydrinking
body
and
flavorful
malt
bill
that
suggests
nutty
toffee
toasted
pilsner
malt
and
bread
crust
hops
are
floral
and
spicy
with
a
nice
balance
of
bitterness
mouthfeel
pops
with
carbonation
while
the
mediumlight
body
finishes
clean
and
dry
with
a
crisp
bite
overall
two
women
is
a
solid
example
of
a
pilsner
and
yet
another
case
of
new
glarus
dominating
the
less
popular
beer
styles
looking
forward
to
my
other
bottle
o
i
just
honestly
couldnt
get
into
this
beer
i
dont
doubt
it
is
decent
but
maybe
i
just
got
a
bad
batch
or
something
also
i
hold
new
glarus
to
a
very
high
standard
and
they
usually
deliver
so
it
may
just
be
a
tough
grading
i
can
see
how
some
would
love
this
beer
and
i
did
appreciate
some
of
the
flavor
complexity
but
im
personally
not
a
fan
of
the
grassy
herbal
tea
notes
i
will
be
spending
most
of
my
free
time
searching
out
some
more
of
their
exquisite
iipa
thanks
to
frankenbrew
for
sending
this
one
my
way
although
i
wouldnt
pursue
it
due
to
the
number
of
great
colorado
beers
available
to
me
i
really
enjoyed
it
poured
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
good
white
head
aromas
of
sweet
malt
honey
and
biscuit
on
the
palate
this
one
is
light
bodied
crisp
and
refreshing
with
flavors
of
sweet
malt
and
honey
poured
into
the
trusty
ol
shaker
glass
poured
a
clear
ambergold
color
with
a
creamy
white
head
that
quickly
disapated
all
i
got
on
the
nose
was
sweet
malt
taste
was
sweet
malt
a
touch
of
honey
and
a
touch
of
lemon
with
no
bitterness
whatsoever
mouthfeel
was
pretty
thin
unless
it
was
a
hot
day
back
in
the
midwest
i
doubt
id
pursue
this
one
again
othe
best
lager
that
ive
had
in
a
long
time
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
new
glarus
beers
but
this
is
enjoyable
especially
between
spring
and
autumn
o
this
is
an
excellent
offering
from
new
glarus
i
have
scooped
up
several
six
packs
and
have
savored
each
bottle
two
women
finds
a
way
to
be
both
full
flavored
and
refreshing
over
all
i
think
this
is
one
of
those
beers
that
get
better
after
you
have
2
or
more
of
them
very
good
anytime
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
to
deep
gold
a
solid
pour
forms
a
dense
rocky
head
that
leaves
a
significant
amount
of
lace
behind
with
each
gulp
i
say
gulp
because
this
is
a
very
quaffable
beer
the
aroma
is
quite
simple
fresh
malt
and
maybe
some
grass
hops
the
taste
reminds
me
quite
a
bit
of
bohemian
lager
more
than
a
german
pilsener
something
perhaps
like
a
czechvar
but
upon
further
reflection
it
is
also
reminds
me
of
a
wurzburger
pils
which
i
suppose
is
what
the
brewer
is
really
trying
to
emulate
a
touch
of
caramel
malt
some
toasted
malt
some
very
fresh
almost
worty
malt
flavor
is
present
here
with
a
touch
of
bubblegum
and
mild
graininess
maybe
i
just
worked
extra
hard
today
this
is
very
quaffable
with
the
right
amount
of
hops
to
make
me
wish
i
picked
up
a
case
of
this
stuff
ive
had
this
a
couple
times
now
and
the
first
time
i
thought
this
was
incredible
this
time
id
say
just
good
ive
been
critical
of
ng
dumbing
down
their
beers
in
some
cases
but
beers
like
this
that
are
well
made
and
sessionable
will
always
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
watered
down
crap
like
back
40
and
the
honey
bock
will
not
d
could
go
back
to
back
with
this
in
a
comfortable
setting
contemplating
the
beauty
power
and
wonder
of
women
medium
bodied
with
a
carbonation
that
fades
fairly
quickly
its
by
no
means
heavy
or
cloying
but
it
lacks
a
bit
of
crispness
and
drinkability
for
the
style
its
a
bit
like
staghorns
skinnier
little
brother
and
thats
not
a
bad
thing
of
course
now
thats
not
an
rd
beer
with
the
attendant
exclusivity
and
whatnot
and
given
that
its
an
untrendy
sort
of
lager
it
will
probably
take
a
dip
toward
3
7
land
despite
the
base
of
ng
hype
it
deserves
more
ittheydeserve
to
be
appreciated
held
cared
for
loved
suddenly
i
have
the
urge
to
befriend
two
solid
german
women
who
know
whats
up
poured
into
a
pint
glass
this
brew
has
a
light
orange
color
very
clear
and
transparent
with
active
carbonation
present
however
not
too
big
of
a
clean
white
head
the
aroma
is
soft
and
subtle
of
quality
malt
slightly
roasted
there
is
not
much
more
than
a
mild
hint
of
citrus
from
hops
the
taste
is
crisp
and
clean
with
a
good
malt
body
and
a
nice
nutty
after
taste
no
real
hop
presence
to
speak
of
the
carbonation
is
mild
and
the
body
is
light
to
medium
this
is
a
good
sipping
brew
i
prefer
the
czech
pilsner
myself
but
this
is
a
solid
brew
o
i
swear
the
previous
recipe
was
slightly
different
but
i
have
no
notes
and
no
proof
either
way
this
is
fantastic
as
dan
careys
german
styles
always
seem
to
be
im
fairly
certain
my
review
up
to
this
point
has
been
pretty
selfexplainatory
this
is
a
very
well
crafted
german
pilsner
for
that
matter
its
just
a
great
beer
overall
this
is

some

no

nose
expresses
noble

and
a

taste
consistent
with
nose
however
its
a
bit
more
watery
than
i
anticipated
theres
also
a
trace
of
citric
acid
in
the
mix
mouthfeel
is
light
and
lively
with
a
slight
acidity
and
a
fairly
clean
finish
all
and
all
a
very
drinkable
style
consistent
german
pils
definitely
one
of
the
better
domestic
tributes
to
the
style
ive
tried
to
date
overall
a
very
nice
german
pils
however
starts
to
fall
apart
toward
the
middle
to
end
of
the
glass
as
it
warms
up
get
this
lager
good
times
soft
light
body
with
medium
carbonation
very
refreshing
d
i
should
have
saved
this
guy
for
a
hot
day
but
i
thought
it
would
go
well
with
my
salmon
which
it
did
new
glarus
does
another
fine
take
on
a
lager
with
this
one
i
wish
i
could
get
their
lighter
beers
down
here
for
when
the
summer
rolls
around
overall
a
nice
pleasant
easy
drinking
pils
the
grain
and
bready
yeast
character
comes
through
strong
in
the
taste
very
smooth
and
a
little
sweet
just
excellent
some
bitterness
in
the
aftertaste

it
feels
proper
to
me

i
dont
usually
drink
lagers
but
this
one
is
pretty
good
if
this
were
on
shelves
here
i
would
be
buying
this
before
the
other
lagers
available
here
o
a
classic
easy
drinking
german
lager
only
comment
i
would
like
a
little
more
noble
hop
taste
to
this
one
but
still
quite
tasty
reminds
me
of
a
less
skunky
heineken
malt
forward
and
very
easy
to
drink
got
the
6
pack
on
my
way
back
home
from

i
would
recommend
this
to
anyone
that
appreciates
true

there

i
could
definitely
put
down
at

a
12
pack
of
these

very
good
beer
overall
another
quality
product
from
new
glarus
wasnt
what
i
was
expecting
a
crisp
slightly
hoppy
lager
but
good
regardless
approve
of
their
experimentation
well
rounded
and
easy
drinking
not
sure
how
to
rate
a
country
lager
but
ba
certainly
has
it
categorized
wrongly
as
a
german
pils
clean
aftertaste
with
a
mildly
bitter
peak
ends
the
taste
on
a
positive
note
very
drinkable
this
one
is
very

its
pretty
true

like
i

in

of

its

it
leaves
a

with
minor

it
does
however
taste
clean
the
sharpness
of
the

shines
through
as
well
as
a
little
maltyness
for
a
pilsner
it
is
very
good
not
sure
if
an
exceptional
batch
but
i
found
this
beer
delightful
for
the
style
without
the
skunking
that
others
have
noted
o
flavor
was
disappointing
my
how
my
taste
buds
have
changed
its
a
good
beer
maybe
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
it
smells
dull
but
has
a
lot
of
flavour
its
also
very
cheap
here
in
mexico
a
pretty
mediocre
beer
for
germany
a
fine
fresh
example
of
a
german
pilsner
a
beer
i
would
down
a
sixer
of
on
a

day
a
very

german

not

at

brew
when

are

goes

u

just

could
market
it
at

to
properly

from

it

detect

not
a
fav
i
found
a
bit
of
a
piney
aftertaste
i
prefer
a
cleaner
mouthfeel
beyond
o
this
did
have
balance
but
it
was
too
skunky
drain
pour
for
a
guy
who
thinks
all
pilseners
taste
the
same
i
actually
kinda
enjoyed
this
one
the
skunkiness
was
just
enough
to
make
it
interesting
if
youre
into
pilseners
youll
like
this
one
well
enough
ill
be
going
back
to
my

porters

keeps

very
smooth

light

bitterness
slight
skunkiness
overall
it
is
an
alright
beer
that
i
would
drink
again
and
have
had
before
but
not
seek
out
to
buy
a
3
5
for
a
little
better
than
okay
overall
enjoyable
beer
i
first
had
this
during
a
trip
to
germany
many
moons
ago
the
germans
dont
serve
it
quite
as
cold
as
i
like
my
beer
but
it
still
holds
up
even
at
42
degrees
without
tasting
skunky
after
reading
all
the
bragging
on
the
can
about
the
beer
i
had
to
try
i
was
happy
with
the
beer
but
not
elated
a
decent
pilsener
small
head
that
went
away
very
fast
good
carbonation
and
a
bitterness
that
was
alright
but
lingered
a
little
too
long
a
nice
effort
wouldnt
turn
away
another
one
this
is
an
enjoyable
brew
but
not
quite
among
the
best
of
this
style
my
mark
out
of
one
hundred
would
87
served
in
a
pilsner
glass
but
when
you
do
drink
it
youll
be
left
wondering
whether
they
were
drunk
or
just
in
bad
wicked
faith
when
they
called
it
a
good
beer
not
to
mention
the
best
beer
in
germany
i
like
it
a
lot
but
the
price
point
is
a
little
high
for
what
it
is
that
said
if
youre
in
the
habit
of
paying
for
stella
and
the
like
this
would
be
a
pleasant
alternative
a
good
beer
my
local
store
had
a
15
off
sale
on
individual
bottles
and
i
like
to
try
new
beers
when
possible
this
one
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
small
head
that
quickly
fades
as
for
the
taste
it
wasnt
nearly
as
good
as
id
hoped
it
would
be
the
beer
was
rather
bland
its
not
the
worst
ive
had
but
i
dont
think
id
buy
it
again
at
least
i
didnt
pay
full
price
i
live
on
the
east
coast
in
the
u
s
and
i
found
a
4
can
pack
of
this
beer
for
5
bucks
and
thought
the
price
was
wrong
as
its
imported
beer
which
is
usually
way
more
expensive
in
my
area
for
some
reason
i
can
only
keep
down
imported
beer
i
thought
it
was
going
to
taste
bad
since
it
was
so
cheap
but
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
quite
pleasant
tasting
my
favorite
beer
is
stella
and
sapporo
japanese
beer
this
one
rates
somewhere
in
the
middle
being
very
refreshing
and
has
a
kick
to
it
that
says
you
are
drinking
beer
not
flavored
water
i
recommend
drinking
it
very
cold
its
great
with
comfort
and
fast
foods
and
i
will
be
looking
for
it
again
i
hope
the
price
remains
this
low
as
it
will
be
my
regular
basic
go
to
beer
way
way
better
than
any
u
s
beer
i
have
tasted
cheers
overall
a
delicious
and
highly
enjoyable
pilsner
overall
its
drinkable
probably
better
very
cold
if
you
like
pilsner
go
ahead
thin
yellow
no
head
to
speak
of
but
this
beer
has
a
little
more
hoppiness
and
flavor
than
your
average
pilsner
i
like
the
dry
finish
and
the
hop
element
also
like
that
this
is
more
fullbodied
than
other
pilsners
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
its
still
a
pilsner
but
you
could
do
worse
or
betterlike
imho
coney
island
mermaid
pilsner
i
found
this
beer
drinkable
but
not
particularly
enjoyablei
prefer
something
with
more
flavor
andor
complexity
found
these
cheap
4
99
for
four
pints
if
i
can
keep
getting
it
at
this
price
this
will
be
my
go
to
beer
i
drank
this
through
a
keg
and
didnt
enjoy
it
as
much
as
i
do
now
i
would
compare
this
to
konig
pilsner
although
konig
is
much
better
this
is
trying
to
keep
pace
nice
cool
refreshing
beer
smell
some
vanilla
grass
almost
candy
like
beer
changes
in
smell
as
it
warms
for
the
better
more
of
a

odor
to
it
very
nice
carbonation
and
straw
like
color
lacing
in
the
glass
is
prevalent
and
stays
head
created
was
thick
and
soapy
great
beer
great
price
go
for
it
overall
solid
german
pilsner
top
to
bottom
the
taste
is
a
bit
of
a
different
animal
then
i
expected
from
the
aroma
but
doesnt
subtract
from
the
overall
enjoyability
of
this
brew
certainly
something
that
any
ba
should
try
out
especially
for
10
a
sixer
o
if
this
is
the
german
equivalent
of
budweiser
i
now
know
why
ze
germans
denigrate
our
macro
lagers
this
shits
all
over
most
of
the
bmc
crew
from
a
great
height
no
its
not
interesting
or
great
but
it
will
get
you
by
in
a
pinch
good
for
parties
fishing
or
any
other
activity
that
benefits
from
shutting
your
brain
off
o
ok
mass
produced
pilsner
not
stellar
but
quite
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
serve
cold
i
love
this
stuff
i
cant
add
anything
to
the
reviews
that
hasnt
been
said
and
said
better
than
i
ever
will
so
i
will
just
say
that
i
whole
heartedly
recommend
it
to
anybody
looking
for
a
great
sessionable
beer
that
you
wont
get
tired
of
fantastic
with
all
types
of
food
especially
stuff
like
pizza
or
wings
i
am

although
i
enjoy
this

either

its
best
served
at

temperature
it
isnt
as
smooth
as
some
other
pilsners
ive
tried
but
it
does
have
a
good
quality
to
it
i
fell
in
love
with
this
one
while
stationed
in
baumholder
germany
i
was
still
a
wannabe
beer
connoisseur
and
bitburger
was
the
first
one
to
intrigue
me
clear
pale
straw
color
excellent
though
subdued
nose
taste
is
a
great
balance
of
pale
malt
and
noble
hops
with
a
fine
dry
finish
the
right
carbonation
gives
this
a
nice
bite
but
the
malt
and
hops
shine
through
and
again
that
dry
finish
at
the
end
is
perfect
overall
not
bad
compared
to
other
similar
beers
bitburger
pours
a
straw
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
and
a
small
head
there
is
a
an
aroma
like
dirty
dishwater
the
taste
is
watery
soapish
and
also
tastes
like
dirty
dish
water
very
light
which
helps
it
but
just
undrinkable
overall
looks
good
but
tastes
bad
incredibly
refreshing
beer
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
now
and
then
or
at
least
the
sort
of
thing
that
i
want
now
and
then
recommended
especially
if
you
can
get
it
in
cans
those
who
like
pilsener
urquell
are
particularly
directed
to
this
overall
drinkability
is
astronomically
high
meaning
very
session
able
beer
i
would
buy
this
beer
again
one
of
the
good
find
for
the
year
overall
an
easy
drinking
but
much
lighter
yet
still
flavorful
german
pils
refreshing
and
a
lovely
contrast
to
all
the
international
style
lagers
at
a
bolivian
beer
festival
biggest
noticeable
difference
was
the
dryness
delivered
by
more
present
hops
and
a
grainy
aftertaste
no
fruitiness
whatsoever
second
time
trying
this
and
while
i
might
have
preferred
it
out
of
the
bottle
versus
in
a
can
it
was
still
a
welcome
contrast
to
the
barely
pilsners
available
here
hops
are
spicy
and
flavorful
not
just
generically
bitter
theyre
well
balanced
against
the
body
of
the
beer
its
flavor
profile
which
is
delicious
the
weight
of
the
beer
is
ideal
not
ludicrously
heavy
not
too
light
everything
is
so
well
balanced
so
tasty
so
delicious
that
you
feel
that
its
all
just
ideally
right
just
right
and
nothing
else
and
the
pleasure
doesnt
fade
as
you
drink
this
is
a
superb
beer

o
id
have
this
again
if
i
were
out
of
other
decent
options
but
wouldnt
seek
it
out
prost
very
bright
noble
hops
up
front
smells
like
malty
goodness
oh
wow
is
this
a
delicious
beer
previously
i
wasnt
so
impressed
but
i
was
wrong
this
pils
has
a
ton
of
flavor
and
goes
down
easy
so
nourishing
and
refreshing
head
retention
isnt
so
good
but
whatever
youre
supposed
to
drink
to
this
fast
anyway
this
is
an
all
around
great
pils
crystal
golden
colored
beer
white
foam
that
vanishes
fairly
quickly
poor
aromanothing
at
all
it
is
very
light
flavored
a
bit
sweet
if
it
is
not
very
cold
bitterness
too
mild
well
carbonatedbig
bubbles
that
shows
a
light
bodied
beer
good
for
a
hot
summer
drink
it
extra
cold
back
in
the
days
of
usafe
i
drank
this
beer
like
water
overall
one
of
my
favorite
german
pilseners
an
especially
nice
treat
on
a
hot
summers
day
notes
a
well
crafted
example
of
a
very
familiar
style
great
price
clear
taste
of
hops
refreshing
no
adjuncts
refreshing
lower
abv
so
its
sessionable
slightly
lower
carbs
available
in

nothing
beats
this
beer
on
a
long
day
prost

to
good
health
and
good
beer
downtown
sd
at
the
neighborhood
on
a
warm
evening
thought
this
sounded
refreshing
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
beer
reveals
an
pale
strawyellow
and
forms
a
unusually
frothy
head
that
leaves
sticky
lacing
all
over
subtle
grassy
scents
and
citrus

the

and
crackery
quickly
dried
by
hop
essence
there
are
few
nuanced
flavors
and
the
light
and

mouthfeel
doesnt
help
matters
short

this
brew
highlights
the
boring
side
of
reinheitsgebot
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
outstanding
beer
what
i
got
smelled
of
corn
and
cereal
although
it
had
no
reason
to
do
so
with
a
rounded
flavor
and
sweetness
emphasizing
more
of
the
same
i
wasnt
expecting
greatness
but
i
had
been
hoping
for
a
little
more
spark
and
life
from
this
one
wondering
if
the
hops
have
faded
or
its
normally
this
way
meh
overall
a
fantastic
beer
easily
at
the
top
of
my
list
when
it
comes
to
pils
i
may
have
to
try
some
out
of
a
canbottle
to
see
if
that
makes
a
big
difference
sludge
is
the
first
word
that
comes
to
mind
swill
is
a
close
second
almost
no
head
no
lacing
a
horrible
stale
taste
that
lingered
in
my
mouth
followed
my
trauma
of
drinking
this
stuff
hard
to
believe
this
is
made
in
germany
i
will
note
born
on
date
on
bottle
says
it
was
made
7
months
ago
not
sure
if
this
made
it
worse
but
it
sure
didnt
get
better
with
age
overall
great
session
beer
clean
and
refreshing
overall
it
has
flavor
which
is
good
and
it
is
better
than
many
mainstream
pilsners
i
would
choose
it
over
any
bmc
a
stand
out
pilsner
when
a
beer
is
crisp
and
refreshing
up
front
followed
by
a
bitter
after
taste
they
always
make
me
think
they
were
designed
that
way
to
make
you
take
another
drink
to
get
some
relief
from
the
bitter
decent
not
great
standard
pilsner
not
all
that
remarkable
poured
from
a
500ml
can
into
an
imperial
pint
glass
color
is
an
almostmedium
gold
and
it
had
a
big
creamy
white
head
that
doesnt
last
long
but
leaves
some
nice
lacing
aroma
is
nice
with
floral
and
bread
it
has
a
pleasant
sweetness
mimicking
the
aroma
but
balanced
against
a
nice
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
it
has
a
thicker
mouthfeel
and
a
little
carbonation
which
make
it
quite
pleasant
all
in
all
a
nice
german
pilsner
before
the
age
of
8
i
thought
this
was
as
far
as
beer
went
it
was
all
my
family
and
their
friends
drank
in
germany
crates
and
cases
i
hated
this
beer
it
was
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
never
drank
i
found
it
fitting
to
put
this
at
500
i
can
firmly
say
that
its
not
terrible
hell
its
even
good
i
can
see
why
they
were
drinking
these
like
water
it
is
but
its
tasty
water
thank
you
nostalgia
ma
bit
thicker
than
you
would
expect
fills
me
up
cheers
i
cannot
say
that
this
was
good
but
good
enough
this
fits
through
the
realm
of
anything
in
the
grocery
better
than
a
lager
this
beer
has
a
good
mouthfeel
otherwise
you
are
able
to
taste
a
mix
of
hoppy
malty
tricks
the
smell
is
a
tad
sour
but
it
still
lasts
me
beyond
the
hour
this
has
a
nice
color
a
color
that
tells
me
that
everything
is
ok
and
that
it
is
time
to
grow
a
little
garden
and
spend
my
time
studying
the
terms
of
an
examined
life
o
as
underrated
a
brew
as
any
you
can
name
its
full
of
good
barley
taste
and
stings
your
tongue
with
those
wonderfuly
spicy
noble
hops
and
this
one
doesnt
dry
me
out
like
other
pilseners
making
virtually
a
perfect
german
version
love
it
overall
if
pils
is
what
you
are
after
this
is
a
good
choice
i
personally
love
this
beer
and
could
talk
about
it
for
as
long
as
requiredpairs
up
amazingly
with
just
about
anything
spicey
cooked
meats
whatever
its
a
great
beer
and
i
find
it
cuts
that
hankering
for
a
crispy
pilsner
like
no
other
slightly
better
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
i
would
like
to
taste
a
freshly
packaged
version
especially
on
tap
nice
balancing
act
between
the
malt
and
hop
components
o
overall
not
bad
the
style
in
general
is
rather
blah
in
my
opinion
and
this
is
no
different
minimal
aroma
and
flavors
but
what
is
there
is
pretty
good
certainly
better
than
the
bmc
options
that
are
out
there
but
not
something
i
would
choose
to
drink
again
pretty
good
for
the
style
though
the
beer
appeared
a
nice
light
golden
color
with
visible
carbonation
rising
to
the
top
of
the
glass
that
had
a
nice
2
finger
white
foamy
head
that
was
retained
nicely
the
nose
was
a
light
malty
sweetness
as
expected
from
a
good
pils
the
taste
of
the
beer
was
good
and
it
followed
the
nose
but
with
a
hint
of
spice
which
was
probably
attributed
to
the
hops
the
beer
had
a
good
feel
to
it
nicely
carbonated
and
light
the
beer
was
extremely
easy
to
drink
the
beer
was
clean
crisp
and
one
that
i
will
definitely
be
drinking
again
final
thoughts
germanys
no
1
draft
beer
is
pretty
much
what
i
expected
an
average
adjunct
lager
would
i
drink
it
again
probably
not
but
it
is
cheap
and
would
go
nicely
with
pizza
and
a
football
game
o
overall
not
one
of
my
favorite
pilseners
because
of
the
bitterness
and
astringency
not
sure
what
all
the
hype
is
about
its
definitely
drinkable
and
would
pair
nicely
with
anything
off
the
grill
especially
white
meats
but
id
pass
for
something
a
bit
more
balanced
o
one
of
the
better
pils
ive
had
insanely
sharp
o
overall
i
didnt
have
high
expectations
but
this
is
a
pretty
nice
sessionable
beer
although
i
believe
the
true
definition
of
sessionable
is
less
abv
definitely
a
step
up
from
many
of
the
macros
out
there
i
could
easily
throw
several
of
these
back
in
an
evening
but
in
the
world
of
crazy
crafted
brews
this
is
not
a
standout
but
solid
german
pils
foam
dosnt
last
much
o
not
really
flawed
but
too
weak
and
unengaging
o
i
might
recommend
it
to
a
horse
or
another
animal
that
likes
the
taste
of
grass
but
just
ok
for
the
human
palate
i
was
thirsty
enough
to
finish
it
but
i
wouldnt
buy
another
overall
what
we
like
best
about
this
one
was
the
drinkability
the
flavoring
never
became
overwhelmingly
bitter
and
actually
loosens
up
quite
a
bit
by
the
end
of
the
sip
allowing
for
a
cleaner
fresher
finish
the
nose
seemed
overly
adjuncty
and
was
not
entirely
inviting
but
we
were
happily
surprised
once
we
dug
into
the
flavoring
comes
out
of
the
tap
a
pretty
clear
golden
yellow
darker
than
most
pilses
i
have
been
served
with
a
thick
finebubbled
ivory
head
strong
malty
aroma
has
an
overtone
of
sweetish
pear
almost
like
a
cider
crisp
malty
flavor
has
a
firm
fruity
note
mainly
pear
and
just
a
hint
of
hops
smooth
texture
has
good
body
and
good
fizz
overall
a
very
good
pilsner
slight
corn
taste
but
no
one
taste
is
overwhelming
pairs
with
whatever
you
throw
on
a
grill
i
am
going
to
have
to
visit
there
someday
i
like
most
german
beer
but
this
was
8
99
for
a
box
of
six
which
to
me
is
on
the
spendy
side
8
99
for
six
and
these
are
11
2
oz
bottles
to
me
means
it
better
be
very
good
beer
and
i
think
this
beer
is
good
but
not
amazing
so
what
i
mean
is
its
a
little
overpriced
in
my
book
for
how
good
it
is
the
price
is
comparable
to
leffe
and
hofbräuhaus
but
i
think
those
beers
are
slightly
better
than
this
overall
damn
fine
cheap
german
beer
thats
easy
to
chug
much
better
than
typical
american
swill
o
this
is
the
beer
i
wish
we
had
in
the
good
ol
usa
whenever
we
went
to
a
sporting
event
a
dive
bar
or
even
just
your
standard
family
cookout
maybe
then
i
wouldnt
hear
so
many
people
say
i
dont
like
beer
because
the
majority
of
what
the
country
drinks
is
swill
bitburger
premium
pils
while
nowhere
near
a
perfect
pilsner
has
a
pleasant
hop
character
and
a
general
palate
thats
not
a
challenge
to
put
down
unfortunately
thats
more
than
you
can
say
about
anything
bud
miller
or
coors
puts
out
poured
this
into
a
stella
artois
stemmed
glass
pure
withe
head
sitting
over
clear
pale
yellow
liquid
nose
is
grassyhayish
slight
floral
hoppiness
there
too
not
too
shabby
flavor
is
light
bodied
crisp
bitter
clean
very
quenching
the
finish
is
a
nice
bitter
note
left
on
the
palate
after
the
swallow
great
session
beer
great
on
a
hot
day
like
today
one
of
my
top
german
pils
very
refreshing
served
on
the
chilly
side
mouthfeel
and
overall
medium
bodied
powerful
without
being
overlyaggressive
natural
tasting
and
refreshing
for
a
summer
night
a
very
nice
consistency
that
does
not
taste
watered
down
at
all
hot
damn
so
happy
to
score
this
16
9oz
can
fourpack
for
5
99
a
ridiculous
value
beer
with
summertime
written
all
over
it
o
man
i
used
to
hate
this
stuff
thought
it
was
way
too
bitter
now
ive
learned
to
love
it
my
favorite
german
pilsner
that
i
can
easily
find
thanks
tjs
decent
for
the
price
maybe
i
need
to
try
a
fresher
can
overall
i
am
having
this
beer
again
on
tap
it
was
a
fine
example
of
the
style
this
is
a
good
one
for
beginners
as
well
a
good
pilsener
if
not
a
great
one
pretty
fun
drinking
this
out
of
das
boot
glass
good
amount
of
hops
against
clean
pilsner
malts
and
plenty
of
yeast
characters
very
good
all
around
o
the
germans
sure
know
how
to
make
a
german
pilsner
another
authentic
example
i
still
like
this
a
bit
more
than
the
other
conclusion
hmm
well
this
is
an
alright
beer
is
it
a
great
german
pilsener
no
not
really
there
are
many
much
finer
examples
is
it
better
than
anything
that
huge
american
breweries
churn
out
in
mass
production
yes
a
fine
beer
but
not
up
to
the
level
of
almost
all
the
other
excellent
german
beer
i
have
consumed
it
was
a
very
pretty
beer
poured
into
the
nonic
a
pale
straw
with
an
inch
head
fairly
picturesque
the
smell
wasnt
anythin
to
write
home
about
it
smelled
like
a
pilsner
some
light
hops
a
little
metallic
and
some
citrus
the
taste
was
similar
though
better
the
metallic
taste
wasnt
as
present
as
i
wouldve
thought
though
the
citrus
smells
werent
as
present
in
the
taste
it
starts
off
fairly
bitter
and
ends
with
a
nice
dry
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
was
perfect
moderate
carbonation
and
very
very
refreshing
not
a
complex
beer
but
good
enough
to
sip
and
enjoy
on
a
regular
day
catch
a
game
with
or
to
drink
far
too
many
of
o
very
flavorful
famous
german
pilsner
just
a

they
say

500
ml
pale
golden
yellow
colour
against
the
light
one
finger
head
some
bubbles
on
the
side
the
strong
malts
aroma
hit
me
even
as
i
opened
the
can
a
bit
grassy
smell
now
that
its
on
the
glass
too
great
taste
perfect
amount
of
bitterness
would
have
gotten
a
higher
point
if
it
wasnt
that
metallic
maybe
it
tastes
even
better
from
a
bottle
mouthfeel
is
medium
thick
average
carbonation
to
be
honest
the
beer
is
basically
slightly
aboveaverage
the
taste
is
not
going
to
wow
you
as
its
very
light
and
with
very
modest
carbonation
however
it
does
make
up
for
the
blandness
with
its
drinkability
factor
not
a
bad
beer
very
refreshing
and
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
it
again
if
im
just
hanging
out
in
the
backyard
not
a
beer
i
would
actively
suggesting
though
tall
can
into
tall
mug
lovely
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
straw
topped
by
a
healthy
bit
of
white
froth
the
nose
comprises
light
grass
sweet
flowers
mild
wheat
and
a
touch
of
cornmeal
way
in
the
background
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
a
bit
more
corn
tossed
in
for
good
measure
the
body
is
a
heftyleaning
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
wet
feel
overall
a
very
solid
pils
easygoing
all
the
way
overall
a
nicely
refreshing
pilsner
usually
i
dont
love
really
grainy
lagers
but
this
one
seems
to
work
for
me
things
here
are
above
average
except
its
appearance
anyway
still
pretty
good
and
highly
yet
easy
drinkable
a
fan
of
germans
pils
should
never
miss
overall
easy
drinking
decent
pils
o
really
enjoyed
this
beer
i
really
like
the
honey
graham
cracker
aroma
and
flavor
the
hoppiness
is
pleasant
and
lingers
in
the
mouth
after
the
finish
this
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
with
no
head
or
lace
its
aroma
is
of
lemons
and
dough
the
flavor
is
lemony
with
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
balanced
by
a
hop
bitterness
that
increases
as
it
warms
the
mouthfeel
is
thin
bitburger
premium
pils
is
only
an
ok
beer
but
a
good
match
for
wiener
schnitzel
sauerkraut
and
mashed
potatoes
recommended
out
of
a
bottle
this
pils
was
a
clear
golden
color
with
an
eggshell
white
head
the
finger
of
foam
left
scattered
lacing
the
aroma
was
faint
but
what
i
did
smell
was
a
blend
of
dry
grains
noble
hops
and
crystal
malt
the
flavors
were
well
boring
to
my
palate
there
wasnt
much
going
on
here
which
surprised
me
given
that
this
beer
was
a
good
reputation
amongst
beer
drinkers
i
mostly
tasted
wet
malts
some
floral
hops
and
a
hint
of
skunkiness
is
this
normal
i
wondered
the
body
was
light
the
mouthfeel
a
bit
watery
and
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
sub
par
in
my
opinion
i
dont
really
know
what
the
fuss
is
about
looks
like
a
standard
yellow
pilsener
good
clarity
with
decent
frothy
head
smells
very
faintly
of
a
pale
malt
cant
find
any
hops
in
the
nose
at
all
tastes
of
a
strong
hard
water
aspect
with
its
mineral
overtones
laid
on
top
of
a
standard
pilsner
malt
and
whisper
thin
saaz
in
the
very
background
that
could
have
stood
magnification
imho
body
is
light
crisp
and
refreshingly
carbonated
this
is
an
ok
sturdy
workhorse
of
a
german
pilsener
best
used
in
sessions
or
as
a
palate
recovery
tool
between
other
more
complex
offerings
bought
this
because
i
wanted
to
try
something
german
not
a
bad
choice
pretty
decent
beer
could
be
described
as
a
good
european
budweiser
this
pours
a
darker
golden
color
with
a
nice
head
it
smells
of
malted
barley
and
has
a
nice
hint
of
hop
in
the
taste
smooth
beer
good
ill
buy
it
again
maybe
not
the
bitburger
beer
is
a
good
euro
style
pilsner
the
beer
poured
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
thick
fluffy
white
head
good
retention
with
plenty
of
lacing
the
smell
is
grainy
with
saaz
and
grassy
hops
the
taste
follows
the
nose
a
well
balanced
pilsener
with
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
on
the
back
end
this
brew
is
light
bodied
with
decent
carbonation
this
was
better
than
i
expected
and
was
refreshing
the
flavor
has
a
distinct
biscuit
taste
along
with
grassyness
that
i
attribute
to
the
hops
the
finish
is
very
crisp
and
clean
with
moderate
bitterness
nice
prickly
carbonation
this
has
always
been
a
favorite
of
mine
it
is
awesome
on
a
hot
day
and
tends
to
be
priced
pretty
well
this
is
an
awesome
german
pils
i
will
say
that
it
seems
much
fresher
in
other
parts
of
the
world
i
drank
a
lot
of
this
in
hong
kong
an
it
had
more
of
a
fresh
hop
character
and
was
certainly
better
than
the
bottles
that
ive
had
in
the
us
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
think
that
bitburger
is
one
of
the
best
even
though
it
is
kinda
runofthemill
i
really
like
that
the
hops
come
through
so
much
in
such
a
light
beer
overall
a
3
5
for
nostalgia
but
does
not
travel
well
to
the
states
having
had
it
in
a
bottle
back
home
have
it
on
tap
in
germany
and
its
good
as
gold
enjoy
o
okay
this
is
actually
a
pretty
good
rendition
of
the
style
not
a
bad
drinker
for
the
price
nice
and
clean
flavors
more
character
than
your
average
macro
lager
and
very
nice

overall
this

not
as
good
as
i
remember
but
i
didnt

anything
about
beer
back
then
i
could
see
some
college
kids
getting
a
hold
of
it
and
thinking
they
found
the
best
beer
in

i
may
not

it
again
for
the
taste
but
i
will
for
the

t

d
very

this
is
a
beer
that
would
be
a
goto
beer
in
a
party
situation
for
me
o
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
low
abv
ensures
a
good
time
to
tip
back
a
few
without
getting
sideways
t
a
slight
hop
sourness
upfront
with
some
crackerlike
malt
lemon
and
some
floral
hop
resin
on
the
finish
there
wasnt
enough
of
a
hit
from
the
hops
for
me
it
kind
of
just
tasted
like
a
slightly
better
bud
light
o
slightly
above
average
ill
keep
buy
this
at
3
99
for
4
pints
a
good
starter
beer
to
get
you
ready
for
a
night
of
amazing
beer
would
drink
again
to
be
honest
i
really
like
this
beer
i
have
it
pretty
often
and
its
my
goto
beer
for
when
i
cant
be
bothered
dealing
with
hops
for
15
per
mini
keg
you
cant
go
wrong
id
definitely
buy
a
six
pack
for
myself
i
probably
wouldnt
use
it
as
a
party
beer
o
im
not
much
a
fan
of
pilseners
but
this
is
ok
for
the
style
a
decent
session
beer
maybe
a
gateway
beer
o
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
and
it
went
down
easy
if
your
looking
to
pound
down
some
cold
ones
while
cleaning

your

this
ones
hard
to
beat
o
easy
to
drink
but
not
too
much
too
it
forgettable
beer
nose
classic
lager
taste
is
also
very
traditional
quite
watery
with
a
touch
of
sour
beers
specific
to
that
class
and
spreads
the
flavors
slightly
unpleasant
that
prevents
the
beer
to
go
further
in
the
flavors
offered
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
to
raise
a
bit
of
malt
but
its
finally
all
the
taste
is
surprisingly
more
of
the
same
which
is
surprising
since
i
wasnt
expecting
the
taste
to
in
any
way
resemble
apples
but
it
kind
of
does
its
got
some
simple
spicy
hops
in
there
but
not
too
much
its
got
a
very
clean
grain
flavour
nothing
like
an
american
lager
im
thinking
this
is
totally
free
of
adjuncts
this
is
a
good
beer
i
wasnt
expecting
it
to
be
but
it
definitely
was
delicious
refreshing
and
easy
and
fun
to
drink
for
a
lager
that
looks
so
overly
clean
it
really
surprised
me
poured

with

as
well
a
pretty
good
level

crisp

overall
this
is
a
pretty
good
pilsener
that
i
got
on
the
cheap
at
trader
joes
glad
i
picked
one
up
i
find
that
bitburger
is
much
better
out
of
a
glass
for
some
reason
out
of
the
bottle
it
can
be
ordinary
o
this
is
a
pretty
good
beer
its
not
blowing
me
away
or
anything
like
that
but
i
would
certainly
have
this
over
any
of
australias
mass
produced
bullshit
any
old
day
of
the
week
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
is
one
of
the
more
common
beers
over
in
germany
hell
if
thats
the
case
then
im
moving
at
least
i
wouldnt
be
offered
carlton
cold
anytime
im
at
a
mates
place
o
not
the
greatest
pilsner
but
still
available
affordable
and
underrated
bought
a
six
pack
the
other
night
to
try
out
pours
like
a
light
lager
not
much
of
an
aroma
on
this
beer
pretty
light
on
the
hop
flavor
i
would
classify
this
more
as
a
lager
than
a
pilsner
pilsners
should
have
more
of
an
upfront
hop
flavor
in
my
opinion
can
taste
some
maltiness
my
guess
is
that
it
is
brewed
with
a
double
or
triple
decoction
no
complaints
on
the
mouthfeel
was
on
the
higher
side
of
carbonation
overall
tastes
like
a
german
pilsner
but
lacking
in
good
flavors
ok
to
drink
overall

into

mug
clear

small

that
melted
quickly
not
much
in
the
way
of

some
pilsnerish

in
you
lean

the
taste
has
that
familiar
pilsner
sting
with
crisp

and
decent

not
all
that
spectacularstandout
for
the
style
but
very
solid
for
an
everyday
kind
of
go
to
beer
especially
during
hot
summer
days
this
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
white
head
youd
expect
to
find
with
the
style
nothing
more
than
that
the
smell
is
a
mix
between
pilsener
and
adjunct
lager
one
i
like
and
one
i
dont
this
leans
towards
the
unfavorable
side
everything
thing
else
meets
expectation
but
does
not
exceed
it
this
is
a
simple
easy
drinking
pilsener
but
its
incredibly
underwhelming
in
regards
to
setting
itself
apart
from
any
macro
on
the
market
i
can
drink
it
but
it
really
wouldnt
be
a
top
choice
o
grape
drank
legit
im
digging
this
beer
theres
a
solid
german
pils
on
the
base
but
right
up
top
is
a
serious
taste
of
grape
drank
grape
drank
500
ml

into
a
snifter
appearance
is
super
golden
and
clear
with
a
decent
white
head
that
subsides
quickly
body
still
has
carbonation
though
nose
is
pilsener
but
lacking
in
that
lovely
yeast
funk
that
the
best
have
its
a
bit
sweet
on
the
tongue
but
still
very
clean
and
an
easy
drinker
as
far
as
mainstream
brews
this
is
a
good
one
id
drink
this
over
budweiser
or
miller
anyday
and
its
not
that
much
more
expensive
goes
well
with
standard
bbq
fare
sausages
and
burgers
this
beer
pours
an
ultimately
clear
and
bright
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
one
finger
bright
white
head
it
smells
of
only
slightly
sweet
malts
with
light
honey
its
sufficient
but
not
as
potent
as
it
probably
should
be
the
flavors
are
clean
and
refreshing
it
tastes
of
soft
sweet
and
slightly
bitter
pale
malts
with
a
soft
sweet
finish
its
ok
but
pretty
standard
it
drinks
fine
crisp
and
clean
it
drinks
very
well
for
nonswill
out
of
a
can
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
especially
on
hot
days
this
is
a
lawnmower
drinker
hands
down
id
recommend
it
if
youre
looking
for
something
thats
too
easy
to
drink
for
random
occasions
o
standard
pilsner
not
a
bad
beer
here
just
not
alot
going
on

a

and
very
sessionable
i
never
even
noticed
this
on
the
irish
lions
menu
before
so
i
thought
i
would
try
it
this
is
a
better
than

pilsner
it
has

and
that
traditional

the
taste
is

the
head
subsides
slowly
leaving
mild
lacing
the
nose
is
very
subdued
sweet
malt
and
a
faint
skunky
aroma
its
flavor
is
smooth
and
sweet
with
a
faint
hop
finish
mouthfeel
is
surprisingly
creamy
and
pleasantly
light
bodied
this
is
an
above
average
export
pils
for
certain
not
a
great
deal
of
flavor
but
very
pleasant
and
does
its
job
nicely
very
versatile
would
be
splendid
in
hot
weather
bitburger
german
pilsner
starts
with
a
golden
yellow
pour
that
has
a
very
white
head
on
it
the
head
faded
and
you
left
with
some
lacing
but
hardly
any
the
smell
is
of
fresh
grains
and
cut
grass
not
my
favorite
smells
when
it
comes
to
beer
the
flavor
is
nearly
the
same
as
the
aroma
but
with
a
little
spark
of
bitterness
in
the
end
its
a
lighter
brew
so
you
can
drink
it
easily
not
really
what
i
want
in
a
beer
but
i
guess
its
ok
for
whoever
likes
it
overall
nice
stuff
would
be
great
at
the
beach
overall
id
say
this
is
an
above
average
eurobeer
its
decent
for
the
style
and
would
be
good
for
the
warmer
weather
id
still
be
radeberger
before
this
though
high
marks
for
bitburger
d
very
drinkable
complex
enough
to
get
you
come
back
for
more
and
the
sessionable
abv
is
nice
rjt
pretty
unimpressive
color
light
honey
yellow
no
head
and
very
little
lacing
but
great
clarity
smells
malty
spicy
theres
a
good
dose
of
noble
hops
very
german
not
much
complexity
but
surprisingly
freshsmelling
the
taste
leads
off
with
a
pretty
good
mix
of
spicy
hop
and
sweet
malt
character
the
body
manages
to
be
light
but
not
thin
hops
take
over
on
the
swallow
but
never
really
become
that
assertive
the
beer
doesnt
taste
very
strong
or
complex
or
interesting
its
real
strength
is
the
balance
its
very
refreshing
and
while
you
wont
find
anything
new
or
exciting
here
it
is
without
a
doubt
a
pleasant
drinking
experience
highly
quaffable
a
superb
session
beer
if
youre
in
a
german
kind
of
mood
dr
3
50
pound
are
you
fecking
kidding
me
like
look
elsewhere
for
great
beer
lads
but
give
this
a
go
if
you
come
across
it
just
dont
pay
more
than
2
50
quid
fucks
sake
with
one
sip
the
beer
becomes
spicysweet
and
floral
with
the
next
bitter
biting
and
minerally
all
the
while
the
beer
keeps
giving
waves
after
wave
of
flavor
for
such
a
simple
beer
its
actually
quite
nice
and
welcomed
notes
its
a
solid
clean
and
very
drinkable
lager
d
very
good
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
have
ice
cold
on
a
hot
summer
day
a
rather
simple
german
pilsner
pours
a
pale
golden
color
that
is
slighty
cloudy
with
a
fast
diminishing
head
there
is
the
scent
of
cheap
grains
and
wheats
has
a
very
grainy
taste
to
it
a
slight
lemon
hint
to
it
but
overal
rather
weak
and
simple
if
you
like
a
simple
imported
beer
give
it
a
try
otherwise
this
one
is
pretty
forgetable
better
than
runofthe
mill
pilsner
quite
bitter
quite
tasty
decent
stuff
would
drink
again
pours
straw
yellow
color
thin
white
head
less
carbonation
than
i
expected
nice
smell
plenty
of
hops
and
an
earthy
yeasty
scent
good
taste
smooth
a
good
pilsner
the
mouthfeel
is
a
little
lacking
though
its
a
smooth
beer
and
theres
not
quite
enough
bitterness
for
a
pilsner
nothing
unique
to
offer
ive
had
this
beer
from
tap
bottle
and
can
and
i
would
recommend
avoiding
the
bottle
experience
stick
to
a
draft
or
find
a
can
4pk
and
a
pint
glass
to
go
with
it
nothing
really
unique
here
but
it
is
a
solid
beer
and
a
easy
drinker
very
drinkable
beer
i
could
easily
drink
4
or
5
pints
of
this
no
problem
a
lager
with
an
above
average
flavour
very
refreshing
goes
down
nicely
and
i
would
have
this
again
if
i
came
across
it
in
a
pub
i
find
this
a
fairly
pedestrian
beer
it
certainly
isnt
gross
nor
does
it
have
anything
particularly
wrong
with
it
it
just
doesnt
do
anything
to
set
it
apart
from
other
german
pilsners
a
missed
opportunity
i
now
understand
where
my
cousin
was
coming
from
d
absolutely
its
my
go
to
beer
to
bring
to
friends
and
not
drink
bud
miller
etc
have
a
few
and
relax
i
can
drink
bitburger
anytime
anyplace
at
the
going
rate
it
is
by
far
my
go
to
beer
to
have
around
and
goes
exceptional
with
my
homemade
pizzas
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sessionable
particularly
on
a
hot
summer
day
slainte
and
prost
i
love
this
beer
simple
honest
and
good
certainly
an
easy
drinking
pils
a
good
example
of
this
style
d
not
impressed
a
little
too
yeast
dominant
overall
the
appearance
and
smell
of
this
beer
is
misleading
it
tastes
really
good
and
is
easy
to
drink
i
recommend
this
if
you
are
looking
for
something
easy
to
drink
yet
delicious
nothing
special
but
exactly
what
a
low
to
middle
grade
version
of
the
style
should
be
a
good
beer
for
gemütlichkeit
this
style
doesnt
excite
most
people
i
know
but
this
is
an
example
of
a
very
solid
pils
the
body
is
delicious
and
the
bitterness
level
is
right
on
i
approve
this
beer
is
a
light
golden
clear
well
carbonated
with
a
nice
head
med
lace
the
smell
is
slightly
skunky
crisp
taste
but
a
little
on
the
bitter
side
i
think
room
temp
is
better
for
this
beer
as
the
chill
tends
to
retain
the
bitterness
i
was
stationed
in
bitburg
germany
and
tasted
quite
a
few
of
these
i
can
get
a
few
of
these
down
wno
problem
d
easy
going
down
i
would
compare
it
to
an
american
budweiser
for
drinking
easy
to
drink
a
lot
but
tastes
way
better
in
summer
or
a
hot
day
would
take
2
or
3
without
thinking
500
ml

hops
light

and

there
is
nothing
special
in
this
brew
i
expected
much
more
d
easy
to
drink
but
not
necessarily
a
good
thing
perfectly
fine
to
wash
down
a
burger
or
two
prösterchen
edit
found
one
in
the
back
of
the
fridge
revisiting
it
now
upped
my
previous
rating
of
mouthfeel
from
3
to
3
5
it
really
aint
that
bad
of
a
beer
i
certainly
would
far
rather
have
one
of
these
than
the
cheep
american
swill
we
all
refer
to
as
bmc
overall
this
beer
seems
watered
down
with
little
distinguishing
features
it
is
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
though
drink
it
when
its
hot
outside
picked
up
a
single
bottle
at
trader
joes
a
while
back
for
1
and
its
been
sitting
in
my
fridge
till
i
cracked
it
open
last
night
poured
it
into
a
bitburger
04l
stemmed
glass
sunshine
yellow
color
clear
body
with
lots
of
carbonation
and
a
decent
looking
fluffy
white
head
smell
was
somewhat
musty
and
skunky
taste
was
nothing
spectacular
tasted
a
lot
of
corn
flavor
and
heavy
on
the
malt
though
the
malt
did
not
weigh
this
beer
down
i
found
it
halfway
smooth
and
easy
to
drink
my
overall
impression
is
that
one
bitburger
is
palatable
but
i
could
not
drink
a
few
of
these
in
one
night
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweet
euro
lager
kind
of
smell
with
small
hints
of
earth
and
skunk
in
the
taste
small
dry
to
a
clean
standard
euro
lager
taste
with
hints
of
earth
and
a
small
hop
a
small
bite
and
light
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
to
clean
aftertaste
just
another
kind
of
standard
euro
lager
drinkability
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
for
anytime
you
feel
like
having
something
nice
and
clean
d
fairly
easy
to
drink
because
of
the
low
abv
but
i
dont
think
id
really
look
to
order
it
again
nothing
really
stood
out
in
the
smell
or
taste
just
a
lot
of
grain
and
bready
malts
wouldnt
order
again
overall
its
a
good
beer
to
sit
and
have
a
few
of
wheres
the
noble
really
nothing
special
here
pours
with
foamy
soap
head
aroma
is
of
grain
very
light
not
to
bold
head
does
not
last
long
as
it
dissipates
leaving
small
trace
grain
some
bread
and
hay
upfront
in
the
taste
good
bitterness
in
the
drink
itself
okay
beer
very
good
for
the
style
just
not
my
preference
pours
very
clear
very
yellow
a
tall
airy
white
head
appears
smell
is
light
and
very
grainy
like
a
silo
pilsener
all
the
way
tastes
good
a
mineral
top
exists
with
the
sheer
biscuitness
bitter
finish
and
maybe
a
little
canny
but
thats
not
enough
to
draw
the
drinkability
down
because
i
could
drink
these
all
day
a
solid
imported
german
beer
for
a
good
price
overall
a
pleasant
beer
w
some
standout
attributes
at
the
same
time
there
are
a
couple
turnoffs
it
all
seems
to
come
together
nicely
in
the
end
but
there
are
a
few
pointers
that
this
beer
is
a
macro
better
than
when
ive
had
it
in
the
past
but
all
in
all
still
the
same
bitburger
not
nearly
as
quality
as
the
ads
during
soccer
games
on
zdf
would
have
you
believe
a
great

beer
medium
dry

got
to
enjoy
and
love
this
beer
in
mainz
germany
on
vacation
this
was
the
beer
of
choice
on
tap
at
my
hotel
bar
and
after
getting
used
to
the
first
which
was
a
hoppier
and
slightly
more
bitterbut
in
a
wonderful
way
beer
then
i
was
used
to
fell
in
love
with
it
and
drank
it
almost
exclusively
two
weeks
on
a
bitburger
beer
diet
and
i
had
a
hard
time
adjusting
to
anything
else
poured
from
a
16
9
ounce
can
into
my
oversized
snifter
pale
yellow
color
with
about
an
inch
of
head
that
soon
disappeared
into
a
whispy
film
on
the
beer
no
real
scents
other
than
some
cut
grass
or
hay
nothing
outstanding
in
the
flavor
some
straw
or
hay
flavor
i
think
this
beer
is
over
hyped
as
germany
no
1
beer
i
guess
i
am
not
impressed
one
can
is
enough
for
me
i
tried
bitburger
for
the
first
time
in
germany
it
was
a
touch
better
there
as
i
recall
but
then
again
overseas
shipping
has
to
mess
with
your
flavor
just
a
tad
still
this
one
is
way
better
than
some
other
imports
ive
had
lately
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
am
glad
i
picked
up
a
bit
this
week
poured
into
a
pint
glass
a
clear
light
yellow
gold
not
much
of
a
head
to
speak
of
even
with
a
vigorous
pour
though
it
is
well
carbonated
smells
bready
with
strong
floral
notes
tastes
of
sweet
malts
slightly
overpowered
by
bitter
hops
and
preripened
grapes
definitely
a
medium
bodied
pils
not
too
light
crisp
mouthfeel
with
a
dry
finish
an
extremely
popular
macrobrewed
beer
in
germany
but
a
bit
overpriced
here
in
the
states
for
what
it
is
i
do
like
it
though
and
recommend
everyone
try
it
at
least
once
beautiful
in
glass
very
light
color
but
a
very
consistent
light
caramel
color
first
taste
is
very
light
a
little
too
cold
to
get
full
flavor
a
little
time
to
warm
and
the
flavor
starts
to
expose
pear
and
apricot
with
a
light
lemon
aftertaste
very
easy
to
drink
it
was
very
good
with
the
heavy
german
food
that
i
was
eating
i
was
a
little
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
flavor
when
colder
and
the
lack
of
real
luster
it
is
just
a
good
beer
not
really
something
i
will
seek
out
worth
a
try
a
good
drinkable
beer
on
a
hot
summer
day
one
of
the
better
canned
beers
of
this
style
and
worth
1
49
for
a
tallboy
taste
well
the
champagne
of
beers
strictly
carbonation
based
would
have
fit
this
beer
aptly
tons
little
bubbles
even
the
color
looks
the
part
taste
well
this
is
better
it
does
taste
like
beer
kind
of
but
with
some
seltzer
water
in
it
budweiser
with
a
euroish
hop
and
yeast
strain
but
more
expensive
d
will
defs
buy
again
inexpensive
and
good
d
this
one
goes
down
easy
its
a
tasty
pilsner
lots
of
folks
on
ba
give
pilsenerslagers
weak
reviews
i
love
ales
as
much
as
the
next
beer
snob
but
with
the
heat
of
summer
ive
been
diving
hard
into
the
pilseners
to
try
and
find
my
favorites
bitburger
is
one
of
those
favorites
to
me
its
a
good
mix
between
a
pils
and
a
lager
not
as
dry
and
white
peppery
as
some
czech
pilseners
and
the
malt
is
more
noticeable
like
a
lager
its
fatty
like
a
lager
but
buttery
like
a
pils
right
amount
of
skunk
crisp
finish
that
doesnt
dry
out
your
mouth
i
found
that
if
i
take
the
time
to
notice
the
smaller
things
in
lagers
they
are
just
as
complex
as
ales
this
is
a
new
discovery
for
me
and
has
opened
up
wonderful
doors
d
light
bodied
crisp
pretty
refreshing
a
little
bitter
for
a
hot
day
but
sitting
outside
on
an
april
aachen
afternoon
it
was
pretty
nice
d
i
find
this
beer
highly
drinkable
and
very
clean
and
wellmade
it
is
nice
but
i
find
it
unexciting
and
bland
d
medium
personally
wouldnt
drink
more
than
one
in
an
evening
mouthfeel
is
medium
not
watery
like
many
lagers
out
there
yet
it
remains
light
and
crisp
on
your
palate
adds
to
light
and
pleasurable
drinking
definitely
very
drinkable
but
may
get
boring
during
extended
sessions
drinkability
as
far
as
german
pils
go
this
one
for
me
is
pretty
tolerable
for
its
high
output
this
isnt
too
shabby
of
a
beer
i
could
possibly
see
myself
coming
back
for
another
this
is
a
pretty
average
and
drinkable
german
lager
looks
very
clear
with
a
light
head
it
has
a
little
hoppy
aftertaste
but
not
much
this
is
the
kinda
beer
you
can
drink
one
after
the
other
its
very
smooth
and
good
for
people
without
hoppy
tastes
very
drinkable
d
a
solid
nofrills
german
pilsener
pleasant
but
the
mouthfeel
holds
it
back
a
bit
i
picked
up
four
500
ml
cans
for
about
6
so
its
pretty
reasonably
priced
worthwhile
if
youre
a
fan
of
german
brews
i
tried
this
beer
on
august
18
2008
after
purchasing
from
one
of
my
local
lcbo
outlets
the
bveer
poured
a
translucent
pale
gold
with
a
generous
white
rocky
head
that
quickly
dissipated
the
aroma
was
grainy
malts
with
some
hops
the
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
mildly
carbonated
the
flavour
was
more
grainy
malt
with
a
bitter
hop
finish
easy
to
drink
but
not
memorable
d
very
easy
to
drink
the
typical
massproduced
german
pilsners
we
get
over

this
is
a
beer
which
gives
you
a
lot
of
pleasure
when
you
drink
a
few
of
them
one
of
germanys
finest
the
taste
keeps
you
going
this
is
very

it
is
good

most

pilseners
and

lagers
summary
the
hoppy
bitterness
make
this
unique
pils
enjoyable
for
huge
gatherings
such
as
germanfest
i
had
this
beer
several
times
during
the
festival
week
bitte
ein
bit
you
could
toss
a
whole
lot
of
these
back
and
theyll
still
be
a
lot
more
satisfying
than
an
american
nascar
beer
but
there
are
better
ones
out
there
from
the
czech
republic
germany
and
the
american
craft
brewers
drinkability
goes
down
easy
i
would
buy
this
again
the
first
time
i
discovered
this
beer
was
in
hamburg
and
i
was
very
skeptical
at
first
as
i
was
only
18
and
i
had
never
had
a
beer
with
the
now
familiar
pilsner
taste
i
drank
this
beer
every
day
the
three
weeks
i
was
there
and
after
the
first
week
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
its
golden
color
and
i
could
drink
it
for
nights
on
end
drinking
this
beer
in
america
is
much
different
because
coming
from
the
midwest
it
is
usually
very
old
and
kind
of
has
a
stale
taste
even
with
this
though
this
beer
is
still
amazing
and
i
would
drink
this
beer
every
single
day
if
given
the
chance
it
is
hard
to
find
in
the
liquor
stores
but
when
i
can
get
ahold
of
it
it
always
makes
things
that
much
better
especially
during
finals
weeks
this
beer
is
by
far
my
favorite
beer
and
the
best
beer
i
have
ever
tasted
thus
far
2

for
a
large
can
in
new
york
sure
why
not
i
thought
while
i
wasnt
disappointed
with
this
whereas
most
of
those
microbrews
are
going
to
be
more
obscure
think
guinness
in
ireland
nice
to
get
a
understanding
of
what
a
pilsner
should
be
theres
some

is

nothing
too
impressive
very
drinkable
as
most
lagers
are
cant
say
ive
overly
impressed
but
this
is
definitely
a
nice
substitute
for
your
typical
american
macro
drinkability
is
pretty
high
as
with
most
pilsners
for
the
style
its
average
a
very
simple
beer
there
are
better
of
its
style
but
its
much
better
than
the
majority
of
pale
lagers
being
consumed
in
australia
lemon

is
the
only
beer
i
know
of
that
tastes
way
better
from
the
can
vs
bottle
i
havent
had
draft
a
refreshing
lawnmower
beer
d
average
brew
with
an
average
taste
ok
so
it
loses
points
on
that
but
overall
i
would
call
this
a
good
beer
clean
smooth
refreshing
what
else
do
you
want
in
the
summer
ok
its
not
summer
yet
but
im
pretending
this
beer
was
a
tad
watery
but
that
could
be
the
style
average
drinkability
id
not
say
no
to
it
in
the
future
but
id
look
to
see
what
my
alternatives
were
before
settling
on
this
bottle
drinkability
only
slightly
above
average
the
maltiness
in
the
finish
makes
it
stand
above
american
lagers
but
it
could
be
much
better
another
wonderful
german
pilsner
pours
a
golden
yellow
slightly
hazy
with
a
small
head
no
real
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smells
slightly
of
hops
and
grain
not
overpowering
taste
is
just
what
you
expect
from
a
german
pilsner
slightly
hoppy
with
a
dry
flavor
excellent
taste
and
very
very
drinkable
beer
is
as
light
as
a
macro
american
lager
and
that
makes
it
go
down
smooth
and
easy
very
refreshing
if
not
for
the
sediment
i
could
put
back
quite
a
few
of
these
i
would
like
to
try
again
when
i
can
be
a
little
more
sure
of
freshness
d
probably
a
sessionbeer
if
youre
not
in
beerranatic
mode
fine
with
most
meals
or
for
parties
just
a
very
standard
typical
nonus
pilsener
with
more
character
than
heinekin
and
stella
artois
drinkability
this
stuff
would
go
down
in
quantity
ill
seek
it
again
its
not
an
incredible
beer
but
its
quite
drinkable
no
off
flavors
to
speak
of
and
the
price
at
9
50
for
8
half
liter
cans
roughly
a
12
pack
of
12
oz
bottles
means
that
this
is
my
goto
beer
when
i
dont
have
much
to
spend
overall
an
average
drink
that
i
would
not
buy
again
drinkability
alcohol
barely
noticeable
its
enjoyable
as
a
session
beer
but
the
body
seems
to
light
and
the
oiliness
hurts
its
drinkability
this
was
worth
the
money
and
im
sure
i
will
be
buying
this
again
in
the
future
it
had
a
semisweet
taste
with
a
classic
pilsner
bitterness
to
it
this
beer
is
quite
carbonated
and
very
refreshing
to
be
honest
the
mix
of
bitter
and
sweet
makes
this
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
excellent
beer
drinkability
very
easy
and
smooth
went
well
with
my
seafood
paella
taste
is
same
as
smell
cologne
and
floral
hops
i
love
a
good
kolsch
as
it
is
my
favorite
style
of
beer
i
would
consider
this
a
cross
between
kolsch
and
a
pilsner
very
drinkable
and
you
will
find
yourself
ordering
another
and
another
d
prettd
rinkable
beer
expected
from
a
pilsner
was
really
expecting
a
german
bud
light
but
was
presently
surprised
by
a
bit
of
complexity
not
overwhelmed
here
but
not
too
bad
this
is
an
easy
drinker
nice
to
session
with
would
make
a
great
light
aperitif
beer
drink
with
seafood
i
wouldnt
have
this
again
drinkability
a
light
and
refreshing
beer
that
is
easy
to
drink
and
yet
still
fairly
flavorful
d
much
more
complex
in
the
bottle
than
in
the
can
although
more
expensive
my
grandparents
bought
this
half
litre
for
me
for
2
19
which
is
a
little
pricy
but
worth
it
for
a
damn
good
german
pilsner
bitburger
is
a
textbook
pilsner
and
is
a
benchmark
for
the
style
i
am
reviewing
from
the
mini
keg
pours
light
golden
in
color
with
a
nice
frothy
white
head
that
quickly
disappears
smells
hoppy
citrusy
and
sweet
with
honey
the
taste
is
malty
with
a
floral
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
smooth
enough
and
the
beer
is
easy
to
drink
nothing
spectacular
but
an
easy
drinker
that
is
a
much
better
choice
than
american
macros
not
a
whole
lot
in
the
way
of
atmosphere
here
as
with
many
pilsners
decent
flavor
and
feel
overall
pretty
solid
for
this
style
overall
this
is
slightly
above
average
for
a
pislner
here
in
germany
notes
from
21405
i
would
buy
this
again
if
i
drank
at
the
proper
temerature
i
drank
mine
warmer
than
ususal
and
it
wasnt
too
bad
kind
of
got
to
like
it
this
one
pours
a
pale
gold
color
with
a
hint
of
malt
in
the
smell
the
taste
doesnt
have
much
to
it
but
its
clean
no
hop
character
to
be
found
really
i
would
rather
have
this
than
any
domestic
pilsner
but
there
are
better
german
pilsners
out
there
a
well
balanced
pale
malt
intro
short
lasting
to
a
bitter
hop
finish
crisp
and
clean
nothing
really
fancy
here
but
quite
refreshing
low
alcohol
isnt
noticable
the
body
is
light
to
medium
no
challenge
just
easy
drinking
straight
forward
pils
simple
pours
a
fizzy
pale
yellow
colored
body
has
a
malty
aroma
a
dry
dusty
taste
with
a
bitter
aftertaste
watery
and
grainy
similar
to
the
domestic
fizzy
yellow
in
appearance
aroma
taste
not
good
theres
nothing
fancy
about
bitburger
but
compared
to
the
other
pilseners
in
germany
its
quite
good
and
very
accessible
it
has
a
golden
body
and
a
soft
white
head
the
smell
is
somewhat
bitter
but
not
at
all
herbal
like
many
other
traditional
german
pils
this
beer
goes
down
smooth
with
a
little
bitterness
but
that
should
be
expected
when
drinking
a
pils
the
trick
with
this
beer
is
to
not
drink
it
immediately
after
pouring
the
germans
whom
i
encountered
recommended
that
it
is
proper
to
let
the
beer
sit
for
7
minutes
before
drinking
the
appropriate
glassware
also
helps
to
amplify
the
taste
bitburger
should
not
be
consumed
in
anything
other
than
a
tulip
glass
or
a
pokal
anything
else
would
be
a
sin
like
most
german
pils
this
beer
is
light
and
easy
to
drink
with
light
foods
fairly
straightforward
german
pils
thats
quite
drinkable
without
causing
offense
pale
amber
with
a
thin
head
very
faint
malt
aroma
flavour
is
a
pleasant
malt
with
a
fine
hop
balance
mostly
bread
flavoured
true
to
style
without
showing
anything
extraordinary
very
drinkable
though
and
a
pleasant
enough
barbecue
beer
a
good
beer
to
start
the
conversion
process
for
macro
swillers
id
buy
it
again
if
there
was
nothing
more
interesting
about
this
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
with
a
big
fluffy
two
finger
head
that
didnt
last
too
long
the
smell
has
some
malts
but
also
an
aroma
the
reminds
me
of
citrus
peels
and
lemon
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
floral
hops
that
give
way
to
some
of
the
citrus
with
some
lemon
and
grapefruit
flavors
that
end
with
a
little
sweet
malt
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
standard
a
little
thicker
than
water
with
some
very
light
carbonation
this
is
pretty
drinkable
beer
although
the
hops
and
citrus
might
be
a
bit
much
for
having
more
than
one
at
a
time
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
straw
yellow
very
thin
looking
colour
and
a
thin
white
head
forms
quickly
settles
to
a
ring
around
the
glass
and
then
disappears
entirely
smell
is
very
toasty
biscuits

nice
malty
pilsener
had
this
on
tap
in
frankfurt
once
and
its
far
from
the
hoppiest
pilsener
but
still
damn
enjoyable
for
being
cheap
and
easy
to
find
stinging
biting
aroma
and
taste
this
one
isnt
terrible
but
its
a
little
rough
around
the
edges
aroma
is
sharp
and
noticeable
decent
pour
real
light
yellow
with
nice
fluffy
white
top
and
good
lacing
thin
and
oh
so
watery
the
flavor
is
weak
a
biting
hoppiness
overpowers
a
lacking
malt
content
its
drinkable
but
the
finish
is
rough
as
well
for
the
buck
its
a
solid
bargain
but
if
you
want
a
good
pils
keep
looking
d
perhaps
this
would
be
better
midsummer
but
aside
from
the
decent
aroma
right
now
it
seems
like
a
pale
eurolager
lacking
the
character
of
a
good
german
pils
drinks
okay
the
hop
profile
i
remember
is
gone
if
we
have
an
old
can
or
the
beer
is
the
same
i
have
changed
worth
a
try
but
not
a
solid
as
i
remember
it
being
would
i
go
back
maybe
not
in
a
hurry
though
would
like
to
try
this
in
one
of
those
5lt
kegs
it
maybe
an
improvement
the
taste
has
a
lot
of
grain
fresh
apple
and
herbal
hops
that
have
a
flowerylemony
character
as
well
it
has
light
sweetness
and
a
balancing
bitterness
that
just
dominates
the
finish
its
crisp
and
light
very
clean
yet
tasty
and
livelytingly
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
small
white
head
smells
of
freshly
baked
bread
and
yeast
quite
a
sweet
taste
with
a
german
yeast
strain
providing
a
nice
flavor
nice
bitterness
to
round
things
out
mouthfeel
is
medium
high
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
it
would
be
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
this
is
an
easy
drinking
inoffensive
yet
flavorful
beer
this
is
also
a
good
beer
to
drink
when
you
are
drinking
several
recommended
enjoyed
this
brew
at
teskes
german
restaurant
in
san
jose
where
it
poured
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
goodly
white
froth
of
head
that
dies
down
within
a
couple
of
minutes
and
lots
of
lacing
the
aroma
is
light
flowery
cherry
mild
and
clean
the
flavor
is
a
clean
grassy
hops
and
wheat
a
very
pleasant
blend
and
certainly
easy
drinking
perhaps
a
little
thin
but
not
so
unusual
for
the
style
a
solid
pilsner
on
tap
nice
anywho
for
being
cheaper
than
almost
any
other
beer
in
the
store
its
pretty
good
its
got
a
lot
more
taste
than
any
american
macros
which
are
higher
in
price
and
its
very
drinkable
the
next
time
im
hanging
out
with
my
friends
and
wanna
have
some
cheap
beer
im
gonna
go
for
a
bitburger
taste
tastes
like
an
american
macrolager
d
the
can
states
germanys
1
beer
and
im
sure
thats
totally
unbiased
i
can
name
several
german
beers
that
are
better
this
one
may
be
better
on

and
in
an
icecold
thick
frosty
glass
its
not
bad
but
probably
tastes
better
after
2
or
3
d
this
is
really
just
an
average
beer
in
most
every
way
not
much
flavor
or
personality
to
speak
of
pass
a
decent
enough
german
pils
appearance
is
rather
lack
luster
no
real

pale
straw
yellow
in

smell
is
pretty
faint
but
some
notable
hops
and
sweet

smell
come
through
taste
is
a
bit
more
pronounced

the
hops

is

is

d
not

not
good

this
beer
pours
a
clear
light
golden
color
with
a
fluffy
sticky
head
a
light
husky
grain
aroma
light
and
husky
on
the
the
palate
with
some
grainy
biscuitness
there
is
a
unpleasant
character
toward
the
finish
i
am
not
sure
what
it
is
corn
maybe
skunkiness
i
am
not
sure
the
point
is
i
really
didnt
like
it
that
much
my
next
step
is
to
try
it
in
the
5l
minikeg
d
this
beer
has
some
good
flavors
with
some
good
depth
to
it
even
though
the
beer
is
pretty
dry
it
has
some
nice
sweetness
to
it
to
give
it
more
character
nothing
wrong
here
of
course
just
nothing
to
keep
me
coming
back
d
a
wonderful
beer
probably
the
pilsner
most
suited
to
my
tastes
i
wouldnt
mind
making
a
night
of
these
especially
with
the
low
abv
d
this
beer
will
leave
you
wanting
more
highly
drinkable
without
filling
you
up
i
was
really
disappointed
with
how
skunky
this
was
it
may
have
been
one
of
the
worst
ones
i
have
tried
d
i
think
this
would
be
an
excellent
session
beer
at
the
pub
this
would
be
a
natural
to
go
with
salted
nuts
as
it
will
cleanse
the
palate
nicely
a
good
patio
beer
and
very
enjoyable
much
closer
to
the
intended
style
in
my
opinion
d
nice
session

light
and
clean

is
superbly
refreshing

overall
impression
this
was
one
of
the
beers
i
cut
my
teeth
on
about
20
years
ago
when
i
lived
in
germany
i
really
never
had
one
once
i
got
back
to
the
states
and
since
ive
been
getting
into
better
beers
ive
avoided
this
one
because
i
considered
it
sort
of
the
coors
of
germany
i
only
picked
this
one
up
to
review
for
another
beer
karma
point
and
didnt
expect
much
from
it
im
cheerfully
surprised
this
is
a
light
beer
but
it
has
enough
malt
to
give
a
rich
taste
and
enough
hops
to
keep
it
lively
and
balanced
cant
call
it
complex
and
given
all
the
extreme
beers
ive
been
drinking
of
late
this
is
a
little
brother
by
comparison
but
this
brother
held
his
own
im
going
to
pick
up
a
sixpack
of
this
when
it
starts
warming
up
it
should
make
a
great
summer
cold
one
recommended
especially
for
meeting
your
coors
drinking
friends
halfway
usaf
europe
supporting
the
german
beer
industry
for
more
than
50
years
this
beer
might
be
considered
bland
by
some
but
for
me
it
is
a
well
made
german
pils
that
adequately
serves
its
purpose
as
a
thirst
quenching
beverage
a
very
quaffable
beverage
indeed
and
i
wouldnt
mind
having
this
with
some
beef
rouladen
or
some
other
german
food
without
sounding
too
cliched

on

at

its

produces

is

and
a
faint
hoppy
spiciness
a
mellow
grain
sweetness
is
in
the
taste
as
well
as
a
sharp
bitterness
in
the
finish
it
has
a
very
light
body
and
is
well
carbonated
a
very
clean
beer
that
is
straight
forward
and
to
the
point
not
a
bad
pils
perhaps
missing
that
special
something
but
it
is
quite
serviceable
the
beer
pours
a
light
gold
color
with
a
spotty
lace
head
the
aroma
is
weak
it
has
a
weak
hop
and
malt
aroma
it
also
has
a
grainy
scent
to
it
that
compliments
the
usual
lager
smell
the
taste
is
dry
and
a
bit
skunky
it
has
pale
malt
flavor
that
finishes
a
bit
grainy
the
mouthfeel
is
good
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
not
that
good
its
one
and
done
for
me
im
not
a
fan
of
the
pilsner
which
is
probably
why
i
didnt
think
to
highly
of
this
beer
it
pour
like
a
fresh
beer
that
generated
some
descent
foam
but
that
didnt
last
the
color
of
the
beer
was
fizzy
yellow
and
didnt
seem
that
appealing
the
tast
was
very
suble
and
finished
with
a
bitter
after
taste
as
the
beer
warmed
the
bitter
after
taste
grew
more
and
more
bitter
i
think
one
was
enough

vacant
on
the
front
12
very
light
and
watery
then
bitter
acrid
taste
on
the
finish
just
not
pulled
off
very
well
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
pretty
big
foamy
head
not
much
on
the
nose
at
all
maybe
just
a
hint
of
astringency
floral
slightly
bitter
hoppiness
hallertau
on
the
tongue
at
first
developing
into
a
more
pronounced
lingering
bitterness
finishes
crisp
and
dry
ok
but
i
guess
i
may
have
a
categorical
dislike
for
german
pilsners
i
prefer
it
to
jever
but
i
think
pilsner
urquell
has
this
one
beat
hands
down
drinkability
you
can
pound
this
beer
due
too
its
light
body
but
theres
better
pils
out
there
a
top
beer
to
drink
with
food
or
if
youre
in
for
a
long
night
of
watching
sport
or
partying
bitburger
will
satisfy
any
thirst
there
are
more
complex
tasting
lagers
around
but
few
refresh
like
this
one
a
rung
or
two
below
the
very
best
but
still
holds
its
own
closest
thing
ive
had
to
an
american
macro
offering
since
ive
been
here
thx
pours
a
lighter
golden
color
witha
pretty
nice
blooming
head
that
stays
pretty
wella
light
grainy
aroma
with
a
light
ironlike
tinge
to
it
this
beer
has
a
sharp
hop
edge
to
it
ecspecially
in
the
finish
there
is
a
malt
bready
backbone
with
a
iron
flavor
in
there
as
well
but
the
bitter
finish
is
the
main
thing
i
get
from
this
beer
a
quaffer
for
sure
something
to
drink
when
u
want
flavor
and
quanity
this
beer
is
crisp
and
light
very
airy
an
easy
drinker
it
could
be
consumed
in
mass
quantities
nothing
special
comes
to
the
forefront
this
beer
is
so
mild
and
plain
there
is
not
much
else
to
write
about
i
got
this
on
tap
at
a
jamaicanthemed
bar
in
central
moscow
it
came
out
in
a
carlsberg
glass
clear
gold
under
a
marvelous
threefingered
contoured
ivory
head
that
settles
very
slowly
into
cliffs
of
foam
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
glass
now
thats
what
a
german
pils
should
look
like
the
nose
was
very
mild
mainly
of
malt
but
with
a
touch
of
hoppy
flowers
in
the
background
the
mouth
was
light
but
not
as
carbonated
as
i
would
have
expected
the
opening
is
pleasant
featuring
mainly
light
malt
the
finish
brings
out
the
distinctive
german
hoppy
bitterness
that
leaves
a
nice
crisp
aftertaste
definitely
a
session
beer
ill
have
another
and
another
and
another
and
notes
not
too
much
going
on
here
a
decent
hoppy
pilsner
paired
well
with
a
smoked
meat
and
saurkraut
sandwhich
light
golden
yellow
with
a
fluttered
for
about
30
seconds
then
champagne
like
bubbles
crept
up
to
form
a
few
patches
of
lace
smells
of
husky
grain
earthiness
and
slight
almost
transparent
sweetness
taste
almost
is
of
slight
sweet
malt
twinge
then
completely
balances
out
with
slight
hop
burp
mouthful
is
thin
but
overall
this
beer
is
rather
drinkable
good
for
session
over
a
year
later
i
have
grown
to
like
this
beer
alot
it
is
a
great
beer
for
the
money
im
not
really
going
to
get
into
tastes
and
smells
and
all
that
weve
all
had
a
german
lager
or
knockoffs
of
the
style
i
like
this
one
overall
not
a
bad
beer
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
i
can
see
how
this
beer
could
be
a
allday
beer
a
decent
example
of
the
style
notes
im
not
a
big
fan
of
german
pilseners
all
things
considered
however
still
found
this
to
be
surprisingly
enjoyable
not
my
style
of
choice
but
if
im
lookin
for
something
to
drink
after
spending
a
whole
day
out
on
the
lake
or
working
in
the
yard
i
could
easily
drink
this
not
bad
had
this
on
tap
at
the
local
pub
and
it
was
poured
in
some
really
cool
wheatbeer
glasses
extra
tall
and
vase
shaped
poured
a
yellow
color
with
a
medium
head
that
died
off
slowly
the
aroma
was
a
little
grainy
and
wheaty
with
some
malts
present
the
flavor
was
very
pilsnerlike
with
some
wheats
apparent
as
well
drinkability
is
much
better
off
the
tap
than
from
the
bottle
and
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
smooth
overall
a
good
pilsener
i
look
forward
to
having
again
when
i
think
german
pilsener
this
will
now
be
the
beer
that
comes
to
mind
drinkability
lesson
learned
ill
avoid
bottles
the
canned
bitburger
is
more
immune
to
the
effects
of
shipping
storage
etc
the
bottles
have
some
of
the
same
quality
of
the
cans
but
skunk
is
something
i
really
dislike
pours
out
a
lemon
yellow
sunny
colour
with
wheat
straw
tones
very
small
and
limited
white
head
leaving
the
slightest
rings
of
lace
clean
and
pilsy
aroma
a
floral
hoppiness
aroma
rises
from
the
glass
quite
inviting
light
pils
maltiness
in
the
taste
quite
hopped
up
and
tasty
crisp
and
clean
refreshing
with
a
somewhat
dryish
finsh
the
mouthfeel
comes
off
as
slightly
watery
but
appropriate
for
the
style
i
could
see
europeans
slamming
pitchers
of
these
as
we
americans
slam
pitchers
of
budweiser
after
work
its
just
bitburger
is
a
hell
of
a
lot
tastier
this
german
pils
is
highly
drinkable
and
extremely
rewarding
a
nice
pilsener
no
big
issues
a
little
too
unpleasantly
bitter
for
my
taste
but
good
basic
pils
and
drinkable
for
style
this
beer
poured
a
very
pale
golden
yellow
color
with
a
large
foamy
head
and
plenty
of
carbonation
a
definite
beer
of
quality
here
pleasing
grassy
aroma
along
with
some
graininess
this
beer
has
just
about
everything
i
need
in
a
pils
very
drinkable
with
a
clean
finish
excellent
i
can
and
have
drink
a
bunch
of
these
in
one
sitting
in
fact
the
one
i
just
reviewed
was
left
over
from
my
day
of
racing
at
bristol
motor
speedway
i
brought
2
eight
packs
of
500ml
cans
one
for
each
race
and
came
home
with
one
can
hell
yeah
its
drinkable
light
gold
color
small
head
aroma
is
malty
a
light
bodied
pilsner
malty
and
hoppy
there
are
some
herbal
tones
going
on
here
as
well
light
tasting
smooth
and
refreshing
hey
it
is
a
lager
after
all
nice
drinking
beer
mouthfeel
is
full
finish
is
smooth
and
dry
aftertaste
is
slightly
bitter
and
somewhat
herbal
a
fantastic
beer
and
one
of
the
best
pilsners
in
the
world
if
not
the
best
clear
pale
gold
with
large
poufy
head
that
leaves
lace
delicate
aroma
of
spicy
hops
a
supremely
appetizing
beer
it
is
delicate
but
not
weak
light
but
not
insipid
the
epitome
of
balance
if
you
dont
like
this
beer
then
you
dont
like
beer
im
actually
surprised
that
this
beer
isnt
better
reviewed
i
guess
most
users
on
this
site
prefer
bigger
beers
well
this
beer
may
be
light
but
it
is
not
bland
if
youre
still
in
doubt
pick
up
a
fresh
six
of
this
and
discover
why
pilsner
is
the
most
popular
style
of
beer
in
the
world
this
pilsener
poured
a
small
white
head
and
there
was
some
lacing
observed
on
the
sides
of
my
glass
the
hue
of
this
beer
was
pale
yellow
and
there
was
carbonation
observed
it
had
a
hoppy
nose
to
it
and
it
was
very
bitter
tasting
and
it
had
a
lingering
aftertaste
to
it
as
well
this
was
a
nice
inoffensive
pilsener
gold
colored
with
a
nice
white
head
smelled
of
sweet
malt
and
floral
hops
tasted
pretty
much
as
it
smelled
with
just
enough
hops
to
give
it
a
nice
crisp
citrusy
finish
without
creating
any
bitterness
all
in
all
a
nice
pilsener
not
a
terribly
complex
beer
but
perfect
for
a
hot
day
i
found
this
beer
on
the
menu
at
a
typical
chain
restaraunt
and
certainly
was
an
interesting
find
although
certainly
not
a
classic
it
stood
out
as
unique
amongst
all
the
other
typical
selections
and
certainly
something
id
have
again
if
i
went
there
another
time
midweight
in
the
mouth
with
a
good
round
maltiness
the
hops
kick
in
on
the
midpalate
and
dont
let
go
until
the
very
end
of
a
long
long
finish
great
bitterness
and
spicy
hop
flavor
while
still
maintaining
its
balance
a
refreshing
level
of
carbonation
keeps
it
all
in
check
drinkablility
a
little
light
for
my
liking
but
still
a
decent
pils

extraordinarily
balanced
a
bit
of

up

a
hint
of
hops
at
the

could
have
used
a
little
more
hop

extremely
clean
a
notch
above
both
bud
and
becks
found
in
a
500ml
white
can
with
about
10
different

on
the
can
this
stuff
gets
around
and
it
should
too
its
pretty
good
although
nothing
overtly
remarkable
good
head
that
fades
fast
clear
straw
colour
a
touch
of

on

another

me
over
to
the
pils

from
the
germanfest
in
fort
wayne
in
poured
a
thin
straw
yellow
carbonated
body
and
a
very
small
head
once
again
it
was
served
to
us
and
may
have
bee
poured
off
it
had
a
very
mild
malt
aroma
and
hoppy
flavor
it
had
an
initially
small
hop
bite
to
it
that
smoothed
in
its
finish
along
with
leaving
an
excellent
lacing
this
delightful
pils
pours
a
bright
golden
color
with
a
sturdy
white
head
and
nice
trails
of
webbed
lace
a
very
nice
floral
hop
aroma
with
a
fading

fragrance
the
full
lightly
roasted
malt
is
rounded
and
lightly
sweet
a
bright
and
edgy
citrusy

spicy

flavor
rules
the
glass
hoppy

not
overly
bitter

becoming
very
balanced

the

is
emptied

having
another
pleasant

its

the

a

is
all
i

draft
beer
unfortunately
i
am
drinking
it
from
a
bottle
this
is
not
offensive
but
it
is
also
not
highly
recomended
either
rather
it
is
a
decent
example
of
the
style
but
not
an
exceptional
one
i
could
buy
this
agian
and
would
not
mind
drinking
it
at
all
but
alas
i
probably
wont
i
had
this
on
tap
and
i
was
very
impressed
by
the
huge
creamy
head
especially
since
the
place
i
got
it
from
tends
to
pour
carefully
or
something
since
you
rarely
get
much
head
on
the
beer
nice
mouthfeel
that
matched
the
creaminess
of
the
head
very
reserved
on
the
hops
but
well
balanced
and
refreshing
had
a
slight
bubblegumminess
that
gave
it
a
little
complexity

i
cant
say
i
will
bother
with
this
one
again
there
are
much
better
pilseners
bitburger
is
right
around
average
draft
i
had
the
chance
to
try
this
one
again
but
on
draft
at
the
flying
saucer
and
of
course
it
seemed
a
bit
better
smoother
texture
and
feel
the
taste
is
a
bit
more
balanced
for
lack
of
a
better
term
and
i
sucked
it
down
so
damn
fast
man
i
really
like
this
beer
the
beer
is
a
light
golden
color
which
would
be
fine
if
not
for
comparison
of
domestic
pilsner
hues
it
has
a
stronger
bitterness
than
american
pilsners
but
its
still
subdued
compared
to
many
german
and
czech
pilsners
the
body
of
the
beer
is
very
light
and
its
not
a
filling
beer
however
once
the
food
arived
the
beer
played
well
as
sausage
washerdowner
though
i
really
like
pilsners
this
is
not
one
id
make
a
habit
out
of
buying
very
light
clear
straw
color
a
large
white
head
quickly
dissipates
to
a
lace
the
aroma
is
simply
hoppy
the
taste
is
simply
refreshing
with
a
zingy
carbonation
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
and
hoppy
and
doesnt
last
very
long
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
i
think
i
might
have
found
a
great
beer
for
all
day
nascar
purposes
im
freezing
right
now
but
i
know
this
beer
will
come
in
handy
when
its
90
degrees
this
is
an
excellent
pilsner
number
three
on
my
list
only
behind
konig
and
pilsner
urquell
just
as
crisp
and
refreshing
as
both
of
those
but
a
little
lighter
in
taste
and
body
pours
a
beautiful
golden
sparkling
glass
of
beer
nice
head
decent
retention
hoppy
grassy
taste
and
smell
very
clean
top
quality
this
is
what
the
big
three
should
be
making
drinkability
i
gave
it
a
five
i
can
drink
this
all
day
if
i
see
it
on
tap
i
will
pours
a
very
clear
bright
yellow
sunshine
tone
with
a
thick
frothy
head
no
collar
forms
on
this
and
the
lacing
is
minimal
but
thats
to
be
expected
with
this
style
certainly
an
enjoyable
brew
and
i
can
sense
this
one
being
popular
sitting
on
the
sundeck
come
spring
and
summer
bought
this
beer
because
i
was
going
to
be
hanging
with
macro
drinkers
and
wanted
to
keep
the
pace
it
is
the
typical
yellow
color
which
is
neither
a
plus
or
minus
there
was
little
head
and
average
carbonation
the
smell
was
more
malty
than
anything
with
few
distinctive
tones
the
taste
was
lager
just
average
slighly
watered
down
with
some
malt
little
hoppiness
i
am
not
a
great
fan
of
lagers
but
this
is
better
than
most
clear
straw
color
with
a
big
fluffy
head
that
spirals
down
to
delicate
lace
but
keeps
a
18
inch
layer
in
a
pilsner
glass
as
well
very
faint
hoppy
and
peppery
aroma
plenty
of
carbonation
is
noticeable
early
works
with
the
subtle
malt
to
give
a
dry
impression
some
sense
of
toasted
biscuit
mid

finishes
softly
less
carbonated
thankfully
not
fizzy
the
bane
of
drinkability
little
aftertaste
a
million
miles
from
a
big
beer
but
theres
a
quaffability
here
pours
a
bright
clear
goldenstraw
colored
body
with
a
big
white
head
that
quickly
diminishes
to
a
nice
sheet
of
lace
on
the
nose
you
get
a
good
whiff
of
german
hops
in
the
aroma
on
the
palate
the
flavor
has
a
nice
bittersweetness
slight
citrus
notes
in
there
light
biscuity
notes
and
perfect
bitterness
and
tingling
feeling
on
the
tongue
from
the
hop
zest
body
is
medium
and
well
carbonated
this
is
a
very
good
pilsener
i
approached
this
beer
with
something
of
a
negative
bias
based
on
a
german
friend
who
calls
bitburger
a
lowestcommondenominator
beer
the
budweiser
of
germany
that
being
said
while
not
great
this
is
better
than
the
bulk
of
mainstream
us
beers
pours
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
fingers
worth
of
dense
nearly
white
foamy
head
hops
are
an
evident
element
of
the
smell
accentuated
by
the
neutral
grain
aromas
i
associate
with
pilseners
hops
are
evident
throughout
running
dryer
as
the
taste
proceeds
while
the
texture
is
somewhat
watery
the
taste
remains
more
substantial
than
i
expected
mouthfeel
is
quite
clean
and
the
drinkability
is
as
good
as
one
normally
finds
in
a
pilsener
i
would
rather
have
a
german
wheat
beer
any
day
but
this
isnt
too
darned
bad
this
is
a
nice
german
beer
i
like
it
better
than
warstiener
which
is
germanys
bud
its
a
typical
pils
light
in
color
with
little
to
no
head
it
has
a
nice
refreshing
taste
thats
not
too
harsh
on
the
buds
but
at
the
same
time
its
not
too
light
that
you
think
its
water
goes
down
smooth
and
finishes
nice
and
easy
im
not
a
huge
fan
of
pils
but
this
one
is
a
goodie
this
beer
is
better
from
the
can
it
pours
dark
straw
with
a
good
head
carbonation
abounds
taste
is
smooth
with
a
strong
sweet
maltiness
that
pervades
hops
are
present
and
perfectly
accent
the
finish
this
is
an
excellent
example
of
a
premium
german
pilsnerlager
i
found
a
local
store
that
sells
this
in
tall
cans
and
it
is
excellent
in
bottles
i
found
it
to
be
less
enjoyable
but
still
quite
good
in
cans
it
is
awsome
ill
leave
it
at
that
the
archetypal
golden
amber
to
straw
color
as
it
sets
in
the
glass
crowned
by
a
modest
white
head
and
the
lace
formed
by
its
demise
a
fine
covering
sheet
the
crisp
and
clean
nose
is
heavy
with
malt
pleasant
enough
to
the
senses
front
is
mildly
acidic
the
hop
pleasing
in
their
spicy
bite
and
the
aftertaste
malt
dry
and
long
lasting
a
good
drinking
beer
and
one
of
the
few
lagerspils
i
find
worthy
of
being
in
my
stable
ill
drink
it
again
the
best
german
pils
ive
had
poured
a
clear
pale
golden
color
with
lots
of
carbonation
thin
white

disappeared
after
about
1
minute
aroma
consisted
of
hops
and

bready
flavor

the
midtones
as
the
beer
warms

finish
is

and

an
enjoyable
pilsner
with
a
decent

balance
in
flavor
pours
a
clear
gold
with
a
thin
and
quickly
dissipating
head
aroma
and
flavor
are
grainy
and
spicy
the
hops
shine
through
quite
well
without
adding
much
bitterness
begins
with
some
bread
and
grain
flavors
and
finishes
spicy
and
dry
with
a
thin
to
medium
body
and
medium
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
smooth
crisp
and
refreshing
a
great
pilsener
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
thick
white
head
that
sticks
to
your
nose
nice
color
and
a
taste
that
is
crisp
and
smooth
goes
great
with
any
type
of
food
i
had
this
beer
fresh
at
the
brewery
life
cant
get
any
better
can
it
pours
a
light
pale
golden
color
with
a
thin
white
head
it
is
quite
aromatic
with
notes
of
spicy
hops
and
grains
it
has
a
sweet
malt
flavor
at
first
with
a
hop
bitterness
to
follow
its
crisp
smooth
and
dry
very
refreshing
this
would
go
great
with
some
grilled
bratwurst
and
german
potato
salad
drinkability
approaches
infinity
we
are
talking
liters
here
one
of
the
best
lagers
in
the
world
with
no
doubt
in
my
opinion
the
other
one
is
leffe
blonde
it
has
a
beautiful
gold
appearance
and
it
is
served
in
a
beautiful
bitburger
glass
refreshing
taste
and
perfect
smell
this
german
lager
is
simply
real
beer
keep
up
the
good
work
at
bitburger
the
tang
of
a
sprout
sandwich
on
sourdough
a
meager
head
over
a
sunny
complexion

toasty
malt
cut
with
a
precise
amount
of
bittering

ends
mostly
clean
except
for
a
few
noble

flavor
whispers
an
eruptive
force
of
flavor
on
the
buds
not
quite
an
easy
drinker
definitely
nice
golden
colour
and
bitter
after
taste
lingers
limited
head
that
quickly
disapates
and
is
to
lightly
carbonated
not
an
impressive
brew
from
germany
the
international
container
was
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
product
crystal

with
a

carbonated

finish

dry
with
a
little
lingering
bitterness
at
the
back
of
the
tongue
a
good
pilsener
though
there
are
better
my
fiancee
really
likes
this
beer
but
then
she
is
german
this
was
a
decent
german
beer
lightly
hopped
aroma
golden
color
with
a
medium
thick
lively
head
light
almost
wheaty
flavor
made
this
a
nice
summer
beer
but
it
wouldnt
really
float
my
boat
as
a
beer
to
keep
stocked
in
the
fridge
good
introduction
to
import
beers
pours
a
very
clear
pale
yellow
with
a
small
thin
white
head
that
fades
quickly
the
smell
is
a
mix
of
a
lemon
twang
and
oak
mixed
with
slightly
grassy
notes
surprisingly
refreshing
even
from
a
style
that
is
probably
my
least
favorite
the
taste
includes
the
same
as
mentioned
int
he
smell
and
has
some
crispy
hops
that
are
balanced
quite
well
like
i
said
im
not
a
big
fan
of
this
style
but
this
is
a
good
one
for
the
style
it
has
a
light
to
medium
body
and
finishes
crisp
very
drinkable
prosit
tan
gold
color
with
a
mixture
of
tiny
and
large
bubbles
cant
keep
its
head
sweet
nose
of
mango
caramel
and
some
sour
yeastiness
a
sweet
malty
attack
with
decent
balance
of
pretty
toast
flavors
the
texture
is
smooth
and
buttery
slight
hop
bitterness
combines
with
roasted
grain
notes
to
keep
it
focused
and
balanced
through
the
mediumlong
finish
another
surprise
based
on
the
commercial
sweetness
and
large
bead
i
guessed
this
was
heineken
a
decent
german
pils
now
i
can
taste
what
some
brewers
are
trying
to
emulate
dry
bright
bitter
and
easy
to
drink
generous
carbonation
smells
good

light
feel
but
not

slightly
buttery
taste
lingers
but
sweet
very
evenly
carbonated
and
definetly
an
easy
drinking
light
lager
i
could
see
this
as
a
crisp
refreshing
summer
pils
a
pleasant
surprise
the
germans
are
masterful
at
packing
flavor
into
light
colored
beers
this
is
a
another
prime
example
light
doughy
grainy
clean
aroma
with
a
hint
of
the
spicey
hops
to
come
flavors
deliver
on
the
aromas
promise
with
the
malt
turning
slightly
sweet
but
is
then
countered
by
a
peppery
hop
finish
perfect
match
for
my
weisswurst
and
spicey
coarse
ground
mustard
prosit
sigh
my
first
reactionbitter
beer
face
to
quote
the
keystone
light
nastiest
of
all
beers
commercial
but
as
i
drank
more
and
the
beer
warmed
i
enjoyed
it
alot
the
aroma
was
quite
hoppy
as
was
the
flavor
but
as
it
warmed
the
maltiness
of
the
beer
increased
and
balanced
well
with
the
hops
the
second
went
down
even
better
i
will
definitely
be
revisiting
this
beer
and
enjoying
it
even
more
important
facts
despite
what
other
reviews
say
i
am
looking
directly
at
three
dead
brown
bottles
right
now
no
green
glass
for
me
dudes
also
considering
these
bottles
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
fridge
and
dusty
there
is
a
chance
that
the
bit
in
the
bitburger
disappeared
over
several
months
storage
this
is
a
great
german
lager
but
if
compared
to
a
czech
pilsner
it
would
be
lacking
some
flavor
nice
golden
color
somewhat
flavorful
well
balanced
and
has
a
crisp
finish
with
touch
of
hop
bite
i
have
a
hard
time
limiting
myself
to
just
couple
of
these
i
have
had
this
in
a
minikeg
also
with
good
results
try
a
bit
of
the
bit
and
you
will
not
be
let
down
lacking
an
eye
pleasing
quality
and
a
potent
nose
although
it
smells
nice
its
far
too
faint
to
be
appreciated
light
bodied
low
profile
saltymalt
character
starts
then
it
finishes
with
a
strange
dryhop
unripened
grapeskin
bitterness
crisp
clean
light
refreshing
but
there
would
be
a
number
of
other
brews
i
would
prefer
that
can
cool
me
down
very
pale
extremely
light
and
dry
it
has
a
soft
maltiness
a
pronounced
hop
flavor
and
a
very
subtle
elegant
bitterness
the
beer
has
an
emphatic
sweet
malt
note
as
well
as
hops
in
the
nose
a
soft
malty
middle
then
a
rousingly
hoppy
finish
the
effervescent
bubbly
crystal
clear
light
yellow
hue
brew
is
topped
by
an
attractive
and
fairly
thick
head
perfect
lace
is
left
down
the
glass
its
quite
enticing
soft
grainy
and
sweet
malt
notes
in
aroma
with
a
pleasant
green
and
mildly
grassy
noble
hop
nose
despite
the
bubbly
appearance
the
carbonation
is
not
overly
high
and
helps
lend
a
very
smooth
and
agreeable
mouthfeel
its
got
a
bit
more
body
than
other
commonly
available
german
pils
and
isnt
as
dry
the
mild
clean
hop
bitterness
hits
upfront
but
a
mellow
sweetness
ensues
it
finishes
crisp
with
light
malt
sweetness
lingering
then
slowly
fading
this
is
a
clean
drinkable
and
relatively
flavorful
pils
i
havent
had
this
for
a
while
and
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
its
quality
bitburger
is
much
better
than
its
counterpart
warsteiner
a
nice
pilsener
pours
out
to
a
bright
yellow
in
the
glass
with
a
decent
head
and
average
aroma
for
the
style
there
is
some
caramel
malt
taste
present
and
some
actual
hops
they
are
not
strong
but
they
are
there
somewhat
heinekenesque
in
flavor
without
the
skunky
aftertaste
u
s
macros
could
learn
something
from
this
one
bitter
bitter
and
just
plain
bitter
clean
aswell
good
session
beer
and
doesnt
give
you
a
hangover
very
pleasant
pretty
average
in
the
german
pilsener
category
crisp
and
clean
but
alcohol
seemed
too
prominent
in
the
flavor
not
bad
crisp
and
clean
some
malt
arrives
toward
the
end
overall
a
real
good
pils
i
would
drink
this
again
very
nice
hopped
pils
with
a
good
malt
back
smooth
not
fizzy
poured
a
golden
yellow
with
a
nice
1
inch
head
that
stays
creamy

and
look
very
nice
no

the

and
i
am
a

ok
at

razor
clean
p
pairs
best
with
a
bleak
violent
desaturated
atmosphere
like

miikes
oldboy
contrasts
daesuhs
hopelessness
nicely
this
is
one
of
my
favorites
neck
and
neck
with
many
czech
pils
this
is
a
nice
pilsener
its
extremely
easy
to
drink
and
is
something
you
can
toss
back
all
day
in
the
summer
its
refreshing
and
thirst
quenching
its
pretty
standard
for
the
style
but
its
well
crafted
ive
been
drinking
loads
of
crap
like
leinenkugel
summer
shandy
labatt
blue
and
even
gulp
bud
light
recently
so
this
hit
the
proverbial
spot
and
im
probably
overrating
this
a
bit
because
of
that
fact
overall
nicely
structured
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
this
all
day
though
i
wish
it
was
a
tad
dryer
i
have
to
give
props
to
sly
fox
pikeland
pils
victory
prima
pils
silver
as
well
as
stoudts
pils
but
if
you
like
pils
troegs
aint
no
slouch
baby
overall
i
probably
wont
drink
this
again
i
cant
say
this
beer
is
bad
but
its
not
something
id
really
like
to
drink
given
to
me
ill
drink
it
but
ill
likely
never
pay
for
it
again
troegs
beers
with
me
are
hit
or
miss
some
i
love
some
i
really
dislike
overall
on
the
refreshing
side
and
goes
down
easy
the
flavor
was
not
really
too
bold
not
too
far
off
from
a
coors
in
my
opinion
still
not
bad
and
appropriate
for
a
hot
day
as
the
name
suggests
pours
to
a
one
finger
head
that
falls
to
an
eighth
inch
layer
with
erratic
lacing
pale
gold
color
aroma
is
pilsner
malt
and
grassyspicy
german
hops
flavor
is
subtle
yet
spot
on
with
perfect
balance
of
the
malt
and
the
noble
hops
mouthfeel
is
true
to
style
damn
good
pils
o
ive
had
this
in
years
past
but
i
must
say
this
is
the
best
it
has
ever
tasted
i
think
they
upped
the
hopbitterness
level
a
bit
at
4
5
with
a
flavor
i
really
enjoy
this
will
be
a
summer
staple
well
done
total
3750
all
in
all
this
is
a
good
beer
to
try
i
feel
that
many
of
the
other
troegs
beers
are
much
better
however
pours
clear
yellow
see
through
and
sunny

bit

more
prominent

the
sun
on
the
label
must
be
mad
at
me
this
is
right
on
for
an
american
pils
its
got
everything
it
should
have
and
nothing
it
shouldnt
while
remaining
interesting
enough
to
keep
my
attention
though
several
it
has
a
barely
cloudy
bright
yet
pale
yellow
color
with
an
inch
of
white
foam
that
recedes
back
into
the
glass
slowly
i
smell
classic
german
pils
malts
light
and
clean
refreshing
for
sure
with
all
kinds
of
citrus
in
both
lemon
and
hops
a
uniquely
refreshing
taste
hopped
better
than
most
but
still
malt
forward
and
nicely
balanced
i
have
always
admired
the
bigger
beers
from
troegs
but
this
one
proves
they
can
cover
the
spectrum
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
a
good
potential
segue
into
craft
for
those
who
dont
already
drink
it
fizzy
carbonation
and
a
clean
finish
i
could
session
this
stuff
all
summer
fantastic
when
ice
cold
not
as
much
when
it
warms
up
so
slug
it
down
slightly
dry
not
digging
that
yet
very
good
flavor
close
to
a
jever
but
lacking
the
aroma
that
should
correspond
with
the
taste
overallcrisp
refreshing
light
and
very
easy
drinking
this
is
a
great
summer
day
brew
overall
the
sunshine
pils
is
a
nice
take
on
the
pilsner
style
it
is
inthebox
but
well
done
not
a
show
stopper
but
if
you
want
to
try
a
domestic
version
of
this
classic
light
bodied
beer
this
will
be
a
nice
pick
for
a
hot
day
beer
is
medium
to
mediumlight
in
body
with
carbonation
of
moderate
intensity
leading
to
a
crisp
slightly
fizzy
but
pleasant
and
appropriate
mouthfeel
closes
dry
with
light
stickiness
remaining
on
the
palate
this
is
a
great
pilsner
i
really
wish
we
got
it
out
west
as
id
buy
a
six
pack
right
away
with
the
warming
weather
even
two
months
old
the
hops
are
super
lively
and
the
barley
is
quite
tasty
and
sticky
i
hope
to
continue
to
see
a
rise
in
more
beers
like
this
across
the
country
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
what
really
does
the
trick
so
immediately
than
a
flavorful
zesty
refreshing
pilsner
maybe
others
indeed
but
this
ones
doing
it
for
me
now
good
stuff
troegs
never
fails
to
delight
this
is
a
substantial
summer
beer
that
made
the
most
of
the
minimal
and
simple
aspects
of
a
pils
and
came
up
with
a
beer
that
was
feather
light
on
palate
it
had
plenty
of
character
and
was
delicate
yet
firm
simple
and
easy
to
drink
before
you
know
it
you
will
have
had
2
or
3
of
these
im
surprised
by
this
despite
how
old
it
was
fantastic
beer
one
of
my
favorite
american
pilsners
o
a
good
example
of
an
american
brewed
german
pils
with
a
decent
amount
of
hoppiness
easy
to
drink
at
4
5
and
good
for
those
who
enjoy
lagers
overall
this
is
an
excellent
summer
beer
it
is
much
less
hoppy
than
the
neshaminy
creek
pils
that
i
had
last
night
and
i
would
have
to
say
mild
for
its
style
as
well
as
a
bit
thin
making
this
an
awesome
beer
for
a
camping
trip
if
it
were
in
a
can
im
sure
its
equally
as
nice
on
tap
i
recommend
this
beer
and
think
pretty
highly
of
it
im
going
to
score
it
in
the
very
high
3s
or
better
o
a
solid
lager
good
taste
none
of
the
cheap
taste
of
an
aal
and
was
quite
refreshing
would
certainly
buy
a
6er
or
12er
if
i
ever
find
them
o
not
bad
but
not
a
very
impressive
pilsener
either
clear
bright
yellow
pour
with
an
aggressive
pour
into
a
red
solo
cup
yielding
a
huge
fluff
of
white
head
that
retained
well
light
grainy
aroma
sweet
pils
malts
similar
taste
pils
malts
fairly
sweet
mild
hops
for
a
bit
of
balanced
corny
grains
just
really
not
my
thing
but
still
pretty
typical
for
the
style
all
around
light
body
not
very
drinkable
to
me
but
if
you
like
the
style
then
sure
go
for
it
d
overall
i
am
a
little
disappointed
with
this
brew
i
know
this
has
won
a
gold
medal
at
gabf
which
typically
equates
to
cream
of
the
crop
brews
however
this
is
just
not
doing
it
for
me
not
only
as
a
german
pils
but
even
as
a
wellmade
beer
yeast
component
too
strong
hop
character
not
enough
maybe
last
years
was
better
overall
this
is
a
great
pilsner
one
that
i
feel
keeps
up
and
surpasses
many
of
the
top
german
pils
o
i
love
german
pilsners
so
its
no
surprise
that
i
liked
this
the
particular
spicy
herbal
hints
in
this
beer
was
nice
brief
writeup
regarding
a
fresh
batch
ontap
this
was
everything
i
had
hoped
for
a
refreshing
easy
drinking
pilsner
with
a
pleasant
earthylemony
hop
profile
no
it
wont
win
awards
for
complexity
or
depth
but
when
youre
washing
down
some
delicious
steamed
crab
chicken
wings
i
cant
think
of
a
better
beer
for
the
task
i
also
think
it
does
an
okay
job
of
coming
across
bigger
than
it
really
is
both
in
mouthfeel
and
flavor
without
ruining
its
drinkability
o
i
am
not
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
but
this
one
is
fantastic
really
hits
the
spot
when
looking
for
a
lighter
refreshing
beer
with
a
different
hop
profile
pours
a
pale
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
and
some
lacing
aroma
and
taste
of
citrus
grains
some
biscuit
malt
yeast
and
a
bit
of
peppery
spicy
hops
palate
is
a
crisp
medium
body
with
good
carbonation
finish
is
biscuit
malt
yeast
citrus
notes
with
a
good
amount
of
peppery
spicy
hops
bitterness
seems
a
bit
on
the
bitter
side
overall
not
the
best
but
an
ok
summertime
pils
o
very
refreshing
and
a
very
solid
example
of
the
style
a
joy
to
drink
on
a
warm
summer
day
another
reviewer
mentioned
that
the
taste
reminded
him
of
when
he
was
a
kid
and
his
father
would
give
him
a
sip
of
beer
and
i
get
also
get
that
a
goto
summer
beer
for
me
crisp
tasty
flavor
profile
surprising
amounts
of
lemon
citrus
add
a
nice
touch
good
balance
on
the
carbonation
medium
body
adds
creaminess
i
enjoyed
this
more
than
expected
would
be
happy
to
session
this
brew
o
another
solid
pils
from
pa
wish
i
had
gotten
it
in
the
summer
o
overall
a
good
pilsner
i
could
see
a
lot
of
noncraft
beer
drinkers
enjoying
this
one
the
nose
doesnt
have
a
ton
going
on
but
the
taste
is
much
better
and
it
is
super
easy
to
drink
could
definitely
see
myself
having
it
again
if
i
was
looking
for
a
pislner
oa
nice
solid
pilsener
with
good
flavor
but
a
little
light
on
the
body
o
its
a
good
beer
refreshing
and
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
oa
refreshing
beer
that
grew
on
me
as
i
drank
it
but
still
it
didnt
seem
to
bring
much
to
the
table
o
good
pilsner
with
some
sweet
light
malts
and
a
crisp
hop
bite
o
a
solid
beer
overall
though
id
like
a
bit
more
depth
o
a
very
good
german
pils
i
would
like
a
little
more
hop
flavor
but
this
is
very
true
to
style
an
excellent
summer
beer
i
would
be
very
happy
to
see
this
in
ky
especially
because
the
alcohol
level
makes
it
easy
to
have
another
one
overall
this
is
a
highly
refreshing
and
quenching
pilsner
i
would
love
to
try
this
on
tap
on
a
hot
day
overall
im
a
big
fan
troegs
fan
so
that
i
enjoyed
sunshine
pils
is
of
no
surprise
to
me
its
not
the
best
pils
brewed
in
pennsylvania
but
is
still
quite
good
o
okay
example
of
the
style
but
id
tale
many
of
the
others
from
troegs
first
overal
this
is
a
solid
summer
pilsner
great
for
a
hot
day
i
normally
dont
like
pilsners
but
this
brew
has
me
changing
my
mind
o
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
sessionable
the
lighter
flavors
and
the
low
abv
combine
to
make
this
one
a
very
nice
summer
beer
12
ounce
bottle
into
pilsener
glass
bottled

pours
slightly
hazy
golden
straw
color
with
a
nice
12
finger
fairly
dense
white
head
with
good
retention
that
reduces
to
a
nice
cap
that
lingers
some
light
spotty
lacing
on
the
glass
aromas
of
big
lemon
grass
pepper
bread
apricot
herbal
floral
and

on
the
finish
for
a
short
bit
fairly
dry
on
the
finish
as
expected
with
some
lingering
hop
flavors
very
pleasantly
balanced
with
a
nice
amount
of
hop
flavor
medium
carbonation
and
lightmedium
bodied
with
a
very
smooth
and
crisp
mouthfeel
no
alcohol
presence
at
all
other
than
a
light
warming
after
the
finish
overall
this
is
a
very
nice
and
well
made
pilsener
nicely
hopped
with
good
flavor
balance
and
very
easy
to
drink
well
done
the
beer
seems
pretty
flat
but
this
does
not
detract
fromit
much
it
is
very
clear
yellow
this
is
a
nice
inclusion
in
their
summer
sampler
and
should
not
be
avoided
this
is
what
a
pils
can
be
o
simple
light
definately
wont
try
it
again
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
from
a
local
brewery
i
probably
wouldnt
get
it
again
but
mostly
because
pilseners
are
not
my
style
awesome
balance
between
malt
and
hop
sweet
pale
malt
and
buttered
potato
roll
balanced
by
a
spicy
hop
presence
and
overall
earthiness
long
finish
for
such
a
clean
pilsner
slightly
tannic
with
lingering
richness
and
butteryness
pretty
good
and
pretty
complex
for
a
pilsner
poured
a
2
white
head
with
slightly
above
average
life
the
body
is
a
clear
straw
yellow
but
from
the
name
id
been
expecting
a
bright
glow
and
really
it
looks
like
any
bmc
pilsner
it
smells
of
grass
and
malt
the
taste
mirrors
the
smell
and
is
fairly
standard
pilsner
with
the
exception
theres
a
stronger
bitter
hops
finish
marginally
above
the
bmcs
mouthfeel
is
great
light
body
well
carbonated
i
like
this
one
a
lot
maybe
my
favorite
of
the
style
so
far
give
it
a
try
o
very
nice
pilsener
great
flavor
and
drinkability
while
i
do
think
victorys
prima
pils
takes
the
style
to
the
next
level
this
is
still
a
good
beer
worthy
of
repeated
purchase
mouthfeeltaste
big
burst
of
hops
in
the
front
that
finishes
crisp
and
clean
with
a
creamy
smooth
finish
to
my
palate
a
nice
pils
that
would
be
a
solid
offering
for
the
summer
months
overall
a
nice
clean
hoppy
pilsner
simply
a
good
summer
beer
overall
a
this
is
just
a
solid
easydrinking
wellbalanced
pils
that
i
think
would
appeal
to
a
broad
set
of
palettes
tough
to
find
anything
wrong
with
it
what
a
fantastic
pilsener
recommended
4
5
o
perfect
for
warm
weather
with
the
warmer
months
ahead
this
would
make
for
a
perfect
summer
sessioner
an
easy
choice
in
a
pilsner
glass
for
a
hot
day
an
excellent
choice
perhaps
best
in
a
lidded
stein
when
outside
this
is
a
refreshing
beer
after
yard
work
or
for
a
summer
gathering
o
pretty
refreshing
on
a
hot
summer
day
nice
flavors
and
overall
a
pretty
good
beer
o
at
4
a
sixer
i
should
have
bought
the
rest
of
their
stock
while
this
beer
might
not
be
mindnumbing
cmon
its
a
pilsner
it
is
just
what
it
needs
to
be
buy
this
beer
mouthfeel
was
medium
bodied
and
crisp
nice
and
dry
in
the
end
allowing
you
to
take
more
and
more
sips
i
could
drink
this
all
day
on
a
hot
day
im
going
to
have
to
trade
me
for
a
case
of
this
fresh
next
summer
overall
i
thought
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
it
was
on
sale
for
3
996
pack
and
i
think
its
a
steal
at
that
price
glad
i
picked
some
up
one
of
my
favorites
of
the
style
another
very
good
example
of
an
underrated
style
by
troegs
if
this
is
a
sunshine
brew
glad
im
in
buffalo
where
the
sun
dont
shine
a
lot
i
wont
be
tempt
to
drink
this
swill
nice
looking
bottle
other
than
that
not
a
lot
nice
to
say
skunky
feel
in
mouth
lacks
body
fair
finger
of
head
i
think
some
workers
from
the
blatz
brewery
are
brew
masters
at
troegs
overall
what
i
would
expect
from
a
decent
pilsner
flavorful
to
the
last
drop
overall
4
0
thank
god
not
all
pilsners
taste
the
same
this
is
a
highdrinkability
hopforward
pilsner
with
a
hop
profile
that
feels
very
american
website
says
they
used
saaz
and
hallertau
but
it
doesnt
taste
very
old
world
like
prima
pils
does
for
example
i
got
less
spicy
herbal
and
more
citrus
floral
from
the
hops
personally
whatever
the
case
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
pours
hazy
straw
yellow
with
a
2
finger
head
that
rings
around
the
top
in
a
thin
lace
smells
of
pale
buttery
malts
with
lemony
citrus
zest
hops
the
taste
of
biscuity
malts
ripe
lemons
sour
grapes
and
lemon
pledge
light
on
the
feel
smooth
crisp
overall
this
tastes
as
its
style
suggests
didnt
really
do
too
much
for
me
o
very
solid
pils
all
around
not
my
favorite
style
but
it
was
very
drinkable
and
very
tasty
o
i
could
definitely
enjoy
this
beer
on
a
summerspring
day
another
great
beer
coming
out
of
troegs
it
is
okay
overall
impression
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
was
a
sample
at
the
troegs
brewery
it
was
great
then
and
i
still
like
this
beer
not
my
normal
style
but
a
great
pilsner
and
a
nice
change
of
pace
something
i
would
not
turn
down
in
the
future
overall
an
outstanding
representation
of
the
style
in
fact
id
argue
a
better
representation
than
the
overlyhopped
and
infinitely
popular
prima
pils
too
bad
this
is
just
a
summer
seasonal
thin
bodied
with
a
crisp
hop
bite
up
front
that
provides
a
decent
amount
of
bitterness
without
overpowering
the
other
flavors
earthy
with
hints
of
grass
straw
and
pine
this
is
countered
by
subtle
citrus
notes
from
the
hops
as
well
as
sme
light
fruit
especially
apple
and
pear
a
bit
watered
down
but
still
well
balanced
and
easy
to
drink
especially
during
these
warmer
months
d
sort
of
a
lightened
version
of
the
prima
less
complex
and
way
cleaner
lighter
malts
hops
are
dialed
back
but
still
firmly
bitter
with
lots
of
character
far
mare
approachable
than
the
prima
a
tad
more
balanced
a
less
harsh
mouthfeel
and
way
more
drinkable
for
that
overall
a
solid
easydrinking
refreshing
pilsner
nothing
pretentious
about
it
a
good
summer
beer
d
quite
enjoyable
nicely
priced
and
very
refreshing
good
take
on
the
german
style
if
you
see
it
give
it
a
shot
lighter
medium
body
higher
carbonation
dry
and
lingering
on
the
tongue
a
bit
prickly
a
nice
summery
pils
which
i
continue
to
enjoy
every
summer
pours
an
orangey
yellow
with
a
nice
cap
of
white
head
on
top
into
my
lost
abbey
stem
looks
fantastic
with
its
clarity
and
in
general
looks
very
inviting
the
nose
is
just
a
touch
of
hops
a
touch
of
grain
and
a
touch
of
sweetness
more
out
of
the
nose
for
the
style
than
what
i
have
had
nice
the
taste
is
really
great
its
like
growing
up
having
crappy
food
bmc
brews
of
a
certain
style
then
trying
some
chefs
reinvention
of
it
this
lightly
sweet
in
the
finish
super
clean
and
balanced
this
beer
goes
down
crazy
easy
this
was
more
balanced
less
sweet
than
mamas
little
yella
pils
i
could
have
a
6er
at
the
beach
no
problem
yum
nice
medium
light
carbonation
and
a
light
but
not
extremely
light
body
give
this
one
a
whirl
overall
i
liked
this
way
more
than
prima
pils
so
i
guess
when
it
comes
to
the
style
i
always
like
them
more
when
on
the
sweeter
side
a
pretty
good
brew
overall
this
and
victory
prima
pils
are
probably
two
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
had
i
really
like
them
both
i
think
both
are
fantastic
session
beers
and
i
certainly
wouldnt
mind
having
easier
access
to
both
like
i
said
about
prima
pils
this
one
is
a
must
try
in
my
book
cheers
and
thanks
yet
again
trxxpaxxs
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
high
carbonation
a
light
body
and
refreshing
overall
feel
a
great
session
beer
that
went
down
fast
and
easy
o
drinks
very
easy
a
good
example
of
the
style
would
be
a
nice
beer
to
bring
to
introduce
bmc
drinkers
to
what
else
is
out
there
there
are
much
better
pilsners
out
there
a
really
nice
summer
seasonal
from
troegs
there
are
alot
of
great
pilsners
that
come
out
of
pa
this
is
certainly
among
them
o
wasnt
impressed
havent
tasted
many
pils
but
this
seemed
a
little
light
for
me

bitterness
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
if
only
all
pilseners
were
this
good
notes
this
pilsener
gets
it
right
strongly
hopped
but
not
over
the
top
and
unpleasant
like
prima
pils
this
has
more
character
than
stoudts
pils
and
is
different
enough
than
brooklyn
pilsener
to
make
it
another
fine
pilsener
to
keep
around
the
bottle
says
a
crisp
hoppy
pilsener
and
i
would
say
it
is
hoppier
than
it
is
crisp
but
the
hops
taste
of
the
noble
variety
and
dont
wallop
you
with
nastiness
this
is
a
joyful
fun
quaffable
summertime
beer
pretty
solid
pilsner
not
much
of
a
smell
to
it
pours
a
light
yellowstraw
color
slight
foamy
head
that
lasts
throughout
leaving
a
faint
lacing
along
the
glass
taste
is
very
good
dry
and
malty
nothing
spectacular
but
went
very
well
with
the
kilbesa
on
pretzel
bread
sandwich
i
was
having
overall
a
great
beer
for
the
summer
it
reminded
me
a
little
bit
of
a
toned
down
prima
pils
almost
like
a
prima
pils
light
its
very
easy
to
drink
and
it
has
a
very
refreshing
tasting
its
definitely
worth
a
try
if
you
happen
to
see
it
on
the
shelves
o
meh
not
one
of
troegs
best
imho
with
prima
pils
sitting
right
next
to
it
on
the
shelf
i
dont
see
myself
buying
this
again
anytime
soon
nicely
done
very
good
beer
crisp
bitter
that
becomes
a
bit
coarse
midpalate
lasting
until
a
hint
of
sweet
malt
fades
in
at
the
end
leaving
a
lingering
sense
of
purpose
and
pleasure
or
maybe
ive
been
in
the
sunshine
a
bit
too
long
o
i
really
enjoyed
this
one
i
would
put
prima
pils
a
little
higher
but
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
o
a
great
summertime
brew
hence
the
name
i
dont
drink
many
lagers
but
i
enjoy
this
one
it
is
very
refreshing
and
light
but
with
plenty
of
flavor
very
flavorful
pils
here
heavy
on
the
grains
and
malts
but
also
perhaps
hoppier
than
most
i
definitely
enjoyed
it
maybe
not
the
best
ive
had
but
its
solid
o
a
nice
beer
i
would
like
it
better
if
it
was
a
little
more
hop
flavor
and
a
little
less
sweet
malts
overall
this
is
a
very
enjoyable
beer
the
flavors
are
complex
and
well
balanced
this
is
a
very
refreshing
warm
weather
beer
overall
a
great
summerbeer
nothing
too
fancy
nice
light
refreshing
wellbalanced
and
easydrinking
this
beer
is
one
that
even
my
miller
lite
drinking
buddies
enjoy
its
got
good
flavor
while
not
being
offensive
or
overpowering
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
warm
weather
beers
with
character
if
not
my
favorite
the
hop
character
of
this
beer
is
excellent
it
is
highly
drinkable
victory
prima
pils
definitely
has
more
hop
character
but
can
be
over
powering
after
a
few
sunshine
pils
is
a
lighter
version
of
prima
pils
perfect
for
late
spring
or
summer
night
i
remember
having
this
for
the
first
time
at
a
local
beach
themed
bar
on
a
hot
summer
of
night
i
fell
in
love
instantly
after
the
first
sip
wow
this
is
a
really
good
beer
i
started
out
drinking
it
too
cold
so
the
bitterness
was
a
bit
harsh
but
as
it
warmed
the
flavors
really
started
to
mesh
d
nice
american
grain
pils
and
easy
to
palate
refreshing
on
a
summer
afternoon
sessionable
refreshing
wasnt
expecting
to
like
it
but
i
might
want
some
more
now
this
beer
is
off
the
charts
when
it
comes
to
drinkability
it
just
hits
the
spot
i
would
say
that
this
beer
is
a
great
starting
point
for
someone
who
is
learning
about
craft
beer
or
if
you
are
trying
to
ween
a
friend
off
budweiser
or
miller
lite
it
is
light
in
body
full
of
flavor
and
pairs
with
just
about
every
kind
of
food
out
there
making
this
a
great
beer
for
anyone
on
a
hot
day
like
today
this
is
just
what
i
needed
to
quench
my
thirst
if
you
come
across
this
beer
id
say
you
better
not
pass
it
by
especially
since
its
just
starting
to
heat
up
outside
overall
a
pretty
good
pilsner
interesting
enough
to
keep
a
hophead
engaged
and
true
enough
to
the
pilsner
to
engage
those
folks
d
quite
high
though
i
dont
care
for
this
much
this
is
what
a
lagerpilsner
beer
should
taste
like
very
clean
crisp
taste
the
hops
are
pleasantly
sharp
compared
to
prima
pils
it
is
cleaner
and
more
direct
to
the
point
of
a
good
lager
where
prima
wanders
in
its
flavor
towards
maltiness
sunshine
pils
stays
with
the
crisp
hoppiness
and
its
perfect
for
summer
pours
a
pale
golden
yellow
with
a
one
finger
white
head
solid
lacing
throughout
aroma
of
grass
a
bit
of
wheat
and
lemon
and
pine
very
light
crisp
flavor
profile
grassy
taste
a
bit
of
wheat
hint
of
lemon
zest
followed
by
a
bit
of
cracked
pepper
and
pine
again
very
light
but
works
well
together
an
excellent
example
of
a
german
pils
do
woo
woo
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
for
sure
its
pretty
hot
and
muggy
today
in
northern
illinois
so
this
hit
the
spot
a
sixer
of
this
and
id
be
happy
well
done
troegs
overall
fantastic
summer
beer
hunt
it
down
and
if
you
dont
like
pilsners
now
this
is
one
that
will
probably
change
your
mind
a
great
thirst
quencher
and
just
an
all
around
good
brew
better
than
some
of
the
american
pilsners
ive
tried
overall
its
good
not
the
biggest
fan
of
the
style
but
a
great
one
to
try
on
my
obscure
beer
quest
overall
another
winner
from
troegs
this
was
the
last
of
the
seasonals
i
have
tried
from
them
and
now
i
can
say
that
they
officially
have
my
favorite
seasonal
lineup
from
any
brewery
the
numbers
may
seem
a
little
high
but
reviewing
to
style
and
comparing
to
other
pilseners
this
is
far
and
away
my
current
favorite
o
to
be
honest
i
was
a
bit
disappointed
considering
the
quality
of
most
of
troegs
other
beers
however
a
second
rate
beer
from
this
fine
brewery
is
still
better
than
many
other
agame
attempts
o
i
love
this
seasonal
pilsner
its
full
of
flavor
and
has
a
good
body
cheers
overall
a
great
pils
nice
malts
light
and
nice
hop
addition
crisp
and
clean
great
summer
beer
a
hard
style
that
is
troublesome
for
americans
with
there
is
no
distinction
of
this
being
a
pilsner
and
a
well
filtered
ale
nose
is
a
tad
more
lime
than
most
a
grain
earth
palate
a
plateau
grain
and
some
hop
its
doesnt
fall
off
dry
it
doesnt
have
any
malt
complexity
the
base
notes
are
there
but
little
interaction
mo
very
clean
light
body
lots
of
carbonation
the
motto
on
the
side
of
the
bottle
says
it
best
crisp
hoppy
pilsner
pilsners
arent
my
favorite
beers
but
this
one
is
definitely
better
than
most
i
need
to
pick
up
some
prima
pils
soon
and
compare
the
two
certainly
above
average
for
the
style
but
not
one
id
probably
go
out
of
my
way
to
find
unless
i
was
really
into
pilsners
o
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
would
be
refreshing
after
working
on
a
hot
day
good
summer
brew
d
very
drinkable
beer
for
the
summer
time
low
alcohol
and
not
filling
at
all
definitely
a
great
choice
for
the
warmer
months
this
is
pretty
good
for
style
but
i
think
id
go
for
prima
pils
over
this
for
its
pennsylvania
brother
connection
however
if
melon
is
your
bag
this
is
your
summer
melon
beer
right
here
thanks
to
the
dr
for
sending
this
my
way
d
quite
a
delicious
and
drinkable
pilsner
i
could
easily
kill
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
hot
day
a
good
pilsener
from
troegs
and
has
all
the
makings
of
a
good
sessions
beer
perfect
for
a
nice
hot
sunny
day
do
crisp
and
drinkable
with
some
interesting
spice
and
great
beer
to
have
for
summer
o
average
beer
got
3
this
in
a
mixed
12
and
that
will
be
a
good
amount
for
me
overall
a
very
good
clean
german
style
pilsener
i
was
wary
of
this
one
in
the
mixed
12
but
its
troegs
i
should
have
known
it
would
be
good
this
could
be
snuck
in
with
some
of
the
better
american
macros
without
much
differences
noticed
surprised
how
unhoppy
this
was
coming
from
troegs
it
would
make
a
good
session
beer
but
id
probably
pick
prima
pils
over
this
notes
one
of
the
best
americanbrewed
pilsners
very
tasty
and
refreshing
damn
near
perfect
great
drinking
in
the
warmer
weather
overall
a
very
well
done
german
pilsner
from
troegs
overall
very
well
done
great
balance
of
malt
sweetness
hop
aroma
and
flavor
and
crisp
mouthfeel
the
feel
of
this
beer
is
light
but
has
a
good
feel
like
it
might
be
bigger
then
you
think
but
drinks
like
a
lawn
mower
beer
something
you
would
have
during
the
summer
it
goes
down
easy
and
is
really
drinkable
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
solid
white
head
head
quickly
disappears
leaving
a
film
on
top
the
smell
is
clean
pale
malt
taste
is
very
clean
refreshing
very
similar
to
an
american
wheat
but
cleaner
and
with
a
hint
of
lemon
mouthfeel
is
light
im
not
a
big
pilsner
fan
but
this
beer
is
just
damn
good
and
overcomes
any
ill
feelings
i
have
toward
the
style
nice
warm
weather
brew
moreys
bottom
line
ive
always
liked
this
beer
but
i
ever
only
buy
a
couple
of
singles
each
springsummer
its
just
not
as
good
as
prima
stoudts
or
even
noble
pils
that
being
said
i
enjoy
drinking
it
when
i
do
the
bold
hoppy
esthers
are
what
must
intimidate
some
people
if
you
like
nugget
nectar
or
any
of
the
powerful
hoppy
california
beersyoull
definitely
like
this
one
i
love
german
and
czech
pilsners
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
this
one
is
way
too
bitter
minimal
notice
of
flavoring
in
the
noble
hops
and
has
a
long
lasting
aftertaste
of
negative
flavors
also
has
some
hints
of
barley
and
wheat
flavorings
similar
to
adjuncts
in
fact
there
are
probably
10
macro
pilsnerlagers
that
i
would
rather
drink
than
this
offbalanced
mess
of
a
beer
sorry
to
be
so
harsh
to
troegs
which
i
really
like
some
of
their
other
options
but
i
need
shoot
straight
from
the
hip
and
think
they
need
to
go
back
and
rework
there
attempt
at
a
pilsner
if
you
look
over
any
other
reviews
ive
done
youll
see
i
really
dont
like
pilsners
this
brew
falls
into
that
same
category
i
really
found
this
beer
to
be
incredibly
light
on
flavor
and
mouthfeel
the
only
flavor
i
got
was
the
gross
fresh
cut
grass
flavor
that
i
really
cant
stand
for
me
this
beer
is
not
good
if
youre
into
these
styles
youd
more
than
likely
enjoy
this
one
as
well
mouthfeel
drinkability
very
refreshing
and
easily
drinkable
sort
of
a
plain
pilsner
good
hop
quality
but
just
slightly
bland
for
my
tastes
it
was
a
good
beer
but
there
many
other
better
pilsners
in
my
opinion
d
not
bad
i
do
enjoy
this
time
of
year
when
the
sunshine
comes
out
the
only
drawback
to
this
beer
is
the
over
the
top
chewy
feel
it
really
prevents
me
from
having
more
than
one
or
two
of
these
at
a
time
still
solid
tho
overall
a
solid
dry
hoppy
beer
that
leans
toward
the
bitter
end
of
the
pilsner
spectrum
definitely
refreshing
but
three
would
be
too
many
the
beer
pours
a
pale
straw
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
light
pilsner
malt
scent
along
with
a
dry
german
hop
aroma
its
crisp
and
clean
with
touch
of
graininess
the
taste
is
decent
as
well
it
has
a
smooth
pilsner
malt
flavor
its
goes
down
easy
with
a
mild
hop
flavor
in
the
finish
its
a
simple
easy
drinking
beer
with
little
to
no
imperfections
the
mouthfeel
is
fine
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
good
carbonation
this
is
a
solid
pilsner
its
true
to
style
and
well
brewed
d
good
but
far
from
amazing
drinkability
i
would
choose
this
one
if
i
could
but
it
is
not
distributed
in
utah
a
very
approachable
beer
could
use
this
one
as
a
gateway
beer
for
bmc
drinkers
poured
from
the
bottle
into
my
troegs
pint
light
orange
gold
straw
color
and
one
finger
head
smell
and
taste
was
slightly
sweet
and
spritzy
with
a
nice
hoppy
hit
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
were
both
nice
and
easily
sessionable
a
solid
choice
for
me
d
very
easy
to
drink
slight
citrus
tones
very
good
pilsner
style
d
very
easy
to
drink
this
beer
if
anybody
asks
for
something
similar
to
bmc
but
with
more
flavor
this
is
it
suggest
it
high
drinkability
this
is
a
very
nice
refreshing
and
tasty
pils
d
pretty
easy
drinking
warmweather
brew
clean
crisp
no
off
flavours
and
decently
tasty
while
not
my
favorite
pils
this
is
another
very
nice
example
of
a
fine
americans
brewed
pilsener
the
taste
brings
a
nice
amount
of
bitterness
as
well
as
some
herbal
and
floral
notes
light
grain
fills
out
the
light
body
which
has
some
nice
carbonation
a
really
nice
drinkable
summer
brew
transparent
golden
in
body
with
white
head
on
top
aroma
of
grains
hops
dew
and
some
floral
notes
flavors
of
hops
slight
wet
leaves
floral
notes
some
flittering
honey
notes
and
some
nice
dryness
towards
the
finish
crisp
and
refreshingly
light
in
body
and
carbonation
served
in
a
frosted
glass
at
the
nantucket
lobster
trap
restaurant
this
summery
specialty
shows
a
very
clear
pale
straw
gold
color
with
a
healthy
white
crop
of
head
and
plenty
of
lacing
foretelling
a
good
quality
brew
the
aroma
is
skunky
cereal
wheat
and
rice
much
to
my
liking
for
pilsners
deep
in
doughy
bread
sourness
the
flavor
speaks
of
fairly
creamy
citrus
rice
and
light
rye
wheat
this
pleasant
taste
suits
me
its
got
the
kind
of
crisp
refreshment
you
look
forward
to
but
it
feels
pretty
chewy
for
a
pilsner
creamy
with
relatively
subtle
tiny
carbonation
unusually
smooth
without
sacrificing
too
much
of
the
refreshing
quality
you
expect
from
a
pilsner
very
edible
and
equally
drinkable
great
with
food
and
flavorful
on
its
own
merits
a
highly
satisfying
pilsner
i
had
a
sixteen
ounce
glass
of
this
because
one
of
my
favorite
bartenders
at
one
of
my
favorite
bars
said
this
was
a
good
beer
and
she
really
seemed
to
mean
it
i
also
liked
this
beer
but
would
not
put
it
in
my
list
of
great
german
pilsners
a
little
on
the
smooth
side
to
be
considered
a
german
pilsner
and
not
quite
bright
enough
but
a
very
good
summer
drinker
which
if
it
gets
hot
again
ill
have
a
few
pints
of
drinkabilty
this
is
the
kind
of
beer
people
should
be
drinking
at
bbqs
and
at
ball
parks
not
budweiser
or
miller
easy
to
drink
would
go
great
with
burger
hot
dog
etc
packs
a
lot
of
flavor
for
being
a
messily
4
5
good
stuff
here
drinkable
and
enjoyable
but
nothing
special
atrociously
light
bodied
and
a
forced
smooth
drinking
leaves
me
wanting
to
take
no
more
sips
a
pilsner
even
weaker
by
trying
to
pretend
to
have
some
honey
sweetness
at
5
3
abv
this
is
not
worth
it
avoid
part
of
the
sampler
pack
i
picked
up
and
the
brews
are
about
5
months
old
i
know
i
will
get
killed
for
this
but
this
beer
is
not
as
good
as
sa
noble
pils
not
even
close
a
beauty
in
the
making
perfect
for
a
crisp
autumn
day
or
a
hot
summer
day
right
now
the
current
weather
is
toward
the
latter
i
enjoyed
this
and
when
this
style
is
done
right
it
is
hard
to
beat
dthe
grain
really
drives
the
flavors
here
and
the
hop
presence
is
mild
at
best
and
the
finish
is
a
little
watery
in
terms
of
flavor
it
is
still
tasty
just
has
some
issues
cheers
the
beer
poured
a
very
nice
light
crystal
lemon
color
with
a
12
head
then
it
lay
down
to
a
nice
lace
around
the
glass
the
smell
is
very
crisp
with
a
hint
lemon
and
crisp
hops
the
taste
is
light
lemon
flavor
with
a
hint
of
light
hop
on
the
back
of
the
tongue
very
refreshing
and
has
great
mouth
feel
and
very
drinkable
very
easy
on
the
drinkability
scale
a
definite
summer
thirst
quencher
not
prima
pils
but
a
better
than
average
offering
bought
on
sale
at
4
99
a
six
thats
a
real
deal
this
very
light
neon
yellow
brew
gives
about
12
of
white
head
that
settles
quickly
to
a
thin
layer
and
leaves
small
traces
of
lace
on
the
glass
smell
is
faint
skunk
and
malt
pleasant
but
pretty
thin
taste
is
a
nice
mix
of
faint
skunk
a
moderate
amount
of
light
malts
some
nice
florals
and
a
light
mixed
hop
finishes
with
a
bit
of
resiny
hop
that
lingers
for
longer
than
expected
mouthfeel
is
fresh
crisp
and
smooth
very
tasty
and
goes
down
easily
for
a
light
summer
beer
this
one
was
o
k
light
drinkable
a
good
session
beer
bottle
poured
a
golden
yellow
color
pils
with
a
nice
pure
white
foamy
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
floral
hops
with
crisp
hops
is
pleasant
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
floral
malt
with
balanced
sweetness
and
crisp
dry
hops
no
adjunct
could
be
detected
which
is
nice
but
additional
presence
of
noble
hops
would
have
been
even
better
well
brewed
and
very
refreshing
i
liked
it
well
done
poured
into
a
hefe
glass
color
was
a
very
light
straw
color
with
a
brilliant
white
froathy
head
that
lasted
for
several
minutes
copious
amounts
of
bubbles
rose
from
the
bottom
aroma
was
very
hoppy
with
hints
of
vanilla
and
pepper
taste
was
a
bit
hoppy
at
first
but
mellowed
out
nicely
to
what
was
almost
sweet
very
thin
in
the
mouth
coated
ok
at
first
but
didnt
follow
through
so
by
the
end
your
mouth
was
almost
dry
very
strange
feeling
despite
that
i
kept
wanting
to
drink
more
a
drinkable
pilsner
has
a
pleant
taste
going
down
though
quickly
gets
bitter
very
fast
this
pilsner
alot
of
carbanation
smell
is
also
bitter
the
bitterness
kind
of
hurts
the
drinkabilty
after
awhile
though
so
you
probably
wouldnt
want
to
drink
too
many
of
them
its
crisp
and
refreshing
the
abv
is
appropriately
low
the
hops
just
seem
to
be
slightly
outofbalance
to
me
just
a
touch
too
much
bitter
bite
d
i
could
drink
this
one
all
day
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
and
another
reason
to
look
forward
to
the
summer
the
body
had
a
nice
scrubbing
carbonation
medium
in
density
and
very
drinkable
i
wish
i
had
access
to
this
one
regularly
d
this
is
the
perfect
light
summer
brew
that
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
heat
the
balance
of
the
brew
makes
it
so
tasteful
troegs
is
fantastic
with
making
seasonal
brews
drinkability
german
pilsner
is
one
of
my
favorite
styles
of
beer
this
one
has
a
beautiful
look
to
it
but
pretty
much
the
other
aspect
of
it
left
me
wanting
not
a
bad
beer
and
certainly
drinkable
but
not
earthmoving
for
me
served
to
me
with
a
small
bone
white
head
pale
gold
in
color
with
good
clarity
smells
fresh
with
just
a
kiss
of
grassy
hops
and
a
little
grainy
husk
smell
taste
is
clean
and
mild
more
balanced
than
than
most
but
still
has
some
good
hop
flavor
mouthfeel
is
fluid
and
lively
and
is
only
slightly
dry
on
the
finish
very
drinkable
especially
on
a
hot
summer
afternoon
overall
a
decent
pils
that
is
an
easy
drinker
this
is
a
solid
interpretation
of
the
style
very
european
grainy
with
strong
herbal
and
citrusy
hops
all
the
way
down
just
so
you
know
theres
an
american
behind
it
floral
nose
and
almost
hits
on
the
taste
nicely
carbonated
but
its
two
dimensional
and
doesnt
really
do
anything
to
keep
my
palate
interested
rather
go
for
victory
this
was
a
pretty
decent
beer
very
easy
to
drink
a
few
pretty
good
flavor
also
quite
refreshing
d
it
does
everything
well
without
really
breaking
away
from
the
style
at
all
it
doesnt
have
the
depth
of
complexity
of
prima
pils
but
its
fresh
and
locally
available
drinks
like
precedent
sunshine
pils
hits
all
the
marks
a
standard
pilsner
should
nice
golden
color
light
and
palatable
flavors
great
for
a
hot
summer
day
but
troegs
definitely
isnt
pushing
any
boundaries
with
this
one
its
typical
and
therefore
forgettable
d
overall
fairly
drinkable
after
the
initial
few
gulps
it
could
be
smoother
but
i
guess
it
should
have
that
initial
coarseness
i
got
this
one
as
an
extra
in
a
recent
trade
from
a
very
generous
ba
poured
this
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
good
clean
clear
yellow
with
about
an
inch
of
big
fluffy
white
head
lots
of
visible
carbonation
and
great
head
retention
interesting
nose
on
this
one
typical
pilsner
smell
with
hints
of
lemon
grass
and
floral
notes
slight
scent
of
grassy
hops
right
away
i
get
a
bit
of
lemon
flavor
this
is
really
crisp
pilsner
malts
follow
shortly
after
with
a
good
hop
finish
this
actually
kind
of
has
a
bit
of
a
sour
forefront
to
me
im
absolutely
loving
the
lemon
flavor
this
has
really
nice
carbonation
and
the
body
is
really
light
and
refreshing
i
could
really
kick
the
crap
out
of
summer
heat
with
this
highly
drinkable
beer
d
drinkability
is
just
a
nod
above
average
for
me
i
can
appreciate
a
good
pilsner
no
doubt
but
id
rather
be
enamored
with
a
great
one
d
very
crisp
and
refreshing
nice
hop
presence
without
overdoing
it
excellent
not
just
for
summer
but
year
round
if
it
were
made
year
round
with
a
very
reasonable
abv
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
the
mild
bitterness
opens
up
your
taste
buds
and
palate
so
this
is
an
excellent
beer
to
start
with
brew
is
very
drinkable
very
sessionable
a
crisp
nice
summer
brew
this
is
a
highly
sessionable
brew
goes
down
very
easy
and
would
be
welcome
on
a
nice
hot
summer
day
by
the
pool
sort
of
like
today
d
given
how
light
this
beer
is
in
both
body
and
flavor
this
one
is
easy
drinking
not
sure
it
measures
up
with
the
best
pils
out
there
but
its
not
a
bad
beer
goes
down
well
nothing
hinders
the
drinkability
but
i
will
probably
forget
that
i
had
this
beer
as
soon
as
i
finish
it
my
least
favorite
troegs
beer
so
far
but
to
be
fair
its
a
style
i
dont
particularly
enjoy
overall
this
beer
just
wasnt
for
me
i
can
appreciate
a
fine
pils
but
this
one
just
didnt
do
it
for
me
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
finish
my
bottle
another
reviewer
hailed
this
as
a
great
lawnmower
beer
and
i
couldnt
agree
more
ergo
id
drink
this
like
the
dickens
during
the
summer
but
probably
wouldnt
make
for
a
good
coldweather
komfortbrau
from
a
troegs
mixed
case
and
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
harpoon
pint
glass
bright
golden
color
with
a
very
understated
aroma
nice
balance
between
malts
and
pilsner
hops
very
crisp
pleasant
taste
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
extremely
drinkable
as
i
could
drink
this
beer
all
night
d
drinkability
is
through
the
roof
a
real
lawnmower
beer
you
can
actually
hydrate
from
it
and
it
shines
when
chugged
a
very
easy
drinker
quite
tasty
poured
from
bottle
hopefully
i
didnt
get
a
bad
batch
because
this
beer
was
underwhelming
i
suppose
it
matches
the
style
and
its
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
but
the
crispness
of
the
hops
was
a
bit
too
much
for
me
and
i
barely
got
the
other
taste
hints
what
i
did
get
was
a
little
bit
of
citrus
but
it
wasnt
very
helpful
to
the
taste
so
basically
a
sharp
bitter
beer
but
not
in
a
good
way
and
i
found
it
too
tasteless
i
could
certainly
find
better
in
this
style
for
the
price
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
lager
that
ive
had
man
the
bottle
i
picked
up
looks
so
much
better
than
the
one
listed
above
sucks
to
be
you
obviously
this
guy
pours
a
sallow
color
so
clear
windex
probably
wants
to
contact
troegs
for
pointers
seriously
this
is
capped
by
a
tall
thick
forest
of
white
froth
which
leaves
some
decent
lacing
behind
as
a
death
rattle
the
smell
is
characteristically
light
with
notes
of
light
lemon
wheat
and
some
hoppy
citrusflorals
the
taste
is
mostly
a
watery
mixture
of
floral
hoppy
bitters
though
some
wheaty
citrus
lies
buried
in
the
brewers
sands
of
time
industry
secret
yo
the
body
is
quite
light
with
a
light
carbonation
and
a
refreshing
finish
i
could
see
drinking
this
after
laboring
beneath
a
ravaging
sun
though
i
wouldnt
know
my
domain
is
currently
chilled
by
a
perpetuallyrunning
airconditioner
and
being
rather
refreshed
i
think
its
time
we
ditched
that
worthless
bland
water
shit
whats
it
good
fer
anyway
notes
again
this
does
not
do
much
to
me
these
lagers
are
certainly
not
my
thing
it
feels
like
a
fair
brew
probably
better
under
scorching
weather
which
is
where
it
looks
like
it
is
in
part
marketed
to
sometimes
i
like
to
have
a
good
pilsner
around
in
addition
to
some
pale
ales
to
offer
them
as
entry
points
to
craft
beers
and
this
is
a
good
addition
to
that
line
up
super
refreshing
considerably
more
lemony
then
recent
pilsners
ive
had
another
big
hitter
in
the
land
of
pilsners
this
goes
down
easy
even
though
there
are
other
pilsners
id
reach
for
b
hoppy
but
not
enough
to
push
it
past
other
good
german
pils
into
being
uniquely
american
in
other
words
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
prima
i
can
see
where
the
crystal
malt
comes
in
as
it
does
have
a
sweet
side
to
it
hops
contribute
a
zesty
and
grassy
flavor
but
lean
more
towards
a
bittering
finish
i
get
some
minerality
at
the
end
too
not
too
much
to
complain
about
but
i
could
use
a
bit
of
a
bump
in
body
and
more
hop
flavor
a
more
than
solid
pilsner
and
pa
residents
are
lucky
to
have
so
many
good
ones
readily
at
hand
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
the
aroma
is
earthy
hops
with
pilsner
malt
the
flavor
is
pilsner
malt
as
well
as
earthy
and
spicy
hops
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
beer
is
very
drinkable
thanks
adam
mouthfeel
is
light
and
carbonation
is
above
average
which
fits
the
style
pretty
well
drinkability
is
good
its
a
very
well
made
pilsner
style
beer
the
noble
hops
gave
it
some
nice
earthy
hop
spiciness
to
it
that
i
liked
great
summer
lighter
style
beer
in
relation
to
others
in
the
style
i
think
this
one
does
pretty
well
d
a
decent
german
pils
made
drinkable
by
being
on
the
lighter
side
in
both
flavor
and
body
not
my
favorite
but
gets
the
job
done
good
hot
weather
beer
d
easily
drinkable
but
not
that
much
complexity
going
on
in
this
beer
which
would
make
me
second
guess
on
whether
or
not
to
have
another
acuired
as
a
trade
extra
liked
it
for
the
style
just
finnished
the
lawn
and
couldnt
think
of
a
better
beer
for
90
degree
weather
i
hate
to
say
this
but
there
are
many
other
beers
out
there
which
could
perform
the
same
or
better
this
i
would
keep
on
hand
for
lake
or
river
days
cheers
pours
a
transparent
golden
yellow
with
a
bit
of
a
sparkle
to
it
and
soft
carbonation

to
no

the
same
all
but
non

o

probably
wouldnt
drink
again
first
troegs
beer
ive
had
that
i
didnt
love
i
could
definitely
polish
off
a
few
of
these
however
on
a
hot
day
i
was
looking
for
a
little
more
if
anything
i
would
enjoy
this
beer
more
late
winter
early
spring
that
being
said
it
is
certainly
not
a
bad
offering
but
my
least
favorite
from
troegs
so
far
d
the
lack
of
hops
makes
this
quite
drinkable
this
is
a
fantastic
beer
to
have
at
a
ballgame
beer
is
thin
and
has
a
slight
aftertaste
of
grains
its
a
little
bitter
in
the
back
and
i
wasnt
expecting
it
overall
its
light
and
simple
not
all
that
bad
but
not
on
par
with
the
plis
elite
no
need
to
return
drinkablility
nice
summer
sipper
great
lawnmower
beer
but
it
has
the
umph
to
stand
up
to
most
white
meat
dishes
overall
impression
this
is
a
great
version
of
a
style
that
i
dont
really
care
for
as
such
it
deserves
a
ba
but
this
will
remain
a
beer
that
i
dont
want
to
really
have
again
drinks
like
a
light
beer
packed
with
flavor
could
drink
this
like
miller
lite
but
actually
enjoy
it
great
summer
brew
on
tap
in
the
troegs
sample
room
it
pours
a
crystal
clear
light
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
that
displays
minimal
retension
and
a
little
bit
of
lace
clings
upon
the
glass
nose
is
slight
piney
hops
with
a
note
of
sulfur
twang
taste
is
bitter
upfront
from
the
pinelike
hops
with
some
notes
of
sulfur
clashing
with
the
slight
malty
character
finishes
relatively
clean
and
crisp
slightly
bitter
light
feel
with
minor
carbonation
i
like
i
will
be
seeking
a
full
case
of
this
for
summer
season
sipping
very
nice
beer
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
smell
is
of
malts
some
sweetness
taste
is
crisp
some
hops
a
bit
sour
not
a
whole
lot
going
on
here
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
decent
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
very
mediocre
offering
d
refreshing
drinker
that
i
would
love
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
pleasant
surprise
from
the
boys
at
troegs
poured
a
fairly
transparent
gold
into
a
pilsner
glass
with
obvious
quantities
of
carbonation
two
fingers
of
bright
white
head
and
great
lacing
the
smell
was
certainly
noble
hopsish
with
floral
notes
grass
hay
and
dry
bitterness
the
flavor
certainly
echoed
the
nose
with
herbal
hints
throughout
and
a
nice
crisp
dry
finish
nicely
carbonated
light
mouthfeel
a
great
session
pilsner
well
done
overall
impression
goes
down
nice
and
easy
an
enjoyable
brew
commenting
ive
not
had
too
many
pilsners
but
i
tend
to
think
of
them
being
light
in
every
aspect
flavor
feel
aroma
that
being
said
this
beer
was
quite
enjoyable
light
crisp
refreshing
yet
full
and
hoppy
definitely
a
summer
beer
and
ill
certainly
remember
it
come
june
pours
a
clear
golden
with
a
silky
white
head
nice
lacing
and
retention
nose
has
grassy
malts
light
hops
and
some
citrus
taste
has
pale
malts
followed
by
crisp
herbal
hops
light
body
is
well
carbonated
nice
pilsner
from
troegs
great
beer
drink
outside
on
a
hot
summer
say
this
was
a
great
surprise
coming
from
a
mixed
six
pack
if
i
were
able
to
get
troegs
in
ct
i
would
pick
up
more
this
is
on
the
same
level
of
greatness
as
prima
pils
which
ive
decided
is
the
american
pils
to
judge
all
others
against
i
wonder
how
much
better
this
bottle
would
be
if
it
was
fresh
this
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
and
goes
down
very
quickly
i
could
drink
2
or
3
of
these
while
playing
a
game
of
horse
shoes
while
enjoying
a
cookout
very
drinkable
especially
in
warm
weather
d
quite
a
good
beer
there
are
a
few
i
like
more
in
the
style
for
their
crisper
sharper
flavors
but
this
is
a
solid
offering
d
very
high
great
beer
for
the
summer
wish
i
still
lived
in
harrisburg
this
makes
me
a
little
nostalgic
although
not
as
much
so
as
troegenator
one
of
my
childhood
beers
of
choice
does
this
is
a
very
refreshing
pils
thats
good
on
a
hot
day
overall
a
good
representation
of
the
style
dgood
beer
would
be
a
nice
beer
with
food
like
shellfish
i
might
have
liked
a
little
more
of
an
assertive
malt
profile
for
this
not
as
bready
as
the
style
should
be
d
this
is
another
great
pa
pilsener
great
summer
beer
refreshing
and
tasty
overall
an
excellent
and
very
to
style
pilsner
this
is
up
there
with
the
better
german
exports
and
certainly
one
of
the
best
american
examples
ive
had
a
fine
beer
highly
recommended
for
those
pilsner
requiring
times
d
easy
drinking
summer
pilsner
slight
hops
crisp
finish
enjoy
several
on
a
hot
summer
day
and
admire
the
lacing
on
your
glass
this
beer
poured
a
clear
golden
color
a
one
finger
of
solid
white
head
retains
alright
leaving
some
wispy
lacing
on
the
glass
nose
is
quite
bready
with
some
spicy
pepperish
hops
and
a
touch
of
citrus
hops
nice
malt
presence
taste
starts
with
citrusy
hops
in
the
forfront
grapefruit
and
lemon
is
most
detectable
lending
in
to
a
bready
taste
and
a
slight
bite
in
the
finish
spice
comes
through
here
lighter
side
of
medium
body
low
carbonation
clean
dry
finish
to
it
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
that
one
can
sit
with
for
a
while
notes
this
is
a
great
refreshing
beer
with
excellent
pilsner
flavor
very
flavorful
and
perfect
for
the
hot
summer
months
there
is
nothing
distinct
about
this
pilsner
interpretation
but
it
is
faithful
to
the
style
pours
a
hazy
pale
yellow
color
with
a
small
head
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
hops
with
barely
not
overall
complex
but
more
than
you
usually
get
for
a
pilsner
taste
is
again
like
the
smell
there
is
some
citrus
hops
and
some
barely
present
again
it
is
more
complex
than
most
pilsners
the
mouthfeel
is
of
moderate
carbonation
the
drinkability
is
abover
average
on
this
for
the
style
it
is
solid
and
it
does
have
some
complexity
you
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
it
is
very
smooth
and
flavorful
d
high
as
is
the
intention
i
believe
overall
mission
accomplished
herea
summer
deck
companion
for
lighter
cigars
party
food
more
beer
and
friendstonight
ive
got
all
but
the
friends
and
it
still
works
d
a
great
summer
quencher
but
not
a
lot
of
character
beyond
thirst
quenching
a
nice
pairing
for
fish
and
lighter
summer
fare
so
in
that
regard
its
a
good
enough
brew
tastes
great
one
for
a
hot
summer
day
single
from
westover
market
arlington
va
bottled
060109
d
not
the
best
german
pils
but
its
right
there
as
the
most
refreshing
pils
vegetal
and
fruity
the
malts
and
decent
hop
character
balance
well
together
to
provide
a
crisp
easydrinking
pilsner
which
is
a
step
above
the
rest
tröegs
sunshine
pils
is
a
clear
pale
golden
beer
with
a
nice
elastic
white
head
that
has
great
retention
and
lacing
it
has
a
fruity
grassy
aroma
with
perhaps
a
note
of
pine
it
has
a
smooth
medium
body
with
a
gritty
caustic
finish
it
tastes
nice
and
bitter
with
fruit
and
wood
flavors
it
demands
attention
it
leaves
you
thirsty
but
it
tastes
nice
d
a
topnotch
pils
that
puts
a
nice
body
and
strong
but
not
overdone
hopping
to
offer
up
one
of
the
finest
ontap
pilsner
in
the
bottle
its
victory
prima
pils
for
me
but
ontap
troegs
sunshine
outshines
pp
but
maintaining
firm
but
even
hopping
to
give
a
more
balanced
fulfilling
flavor
very
crisp
and
refreshing
dry
but
not
bone
dry
finish
the
body
seems
to
have
slightly
more
heft
than
im
used
to
in
a
pilsener
which
again
is
more
to
my
liking
very
very
easy
drinker
very
tasty
pils
what
another
great
looking
beer
from
the
troegs
brothers
i
am
impartial
to
german
pilsners
but
this
one
is
another
outstanding
crafted
brew
by
troegs
it
pours
a
rich
cream
head
and
your
glass
may
need
to
be
cleaned
after
drinking
this
brew
nice
scents
of
a
bit
of
pine
and
toasty
german
malts
easy
to
drink
and
quite
hoppy
for
a
pils
i
will
be
getting
this
one
again
real
soon
as
stated
before
i
think
this
is
a
very
solid
pils
an
easy
drinker
that
i
gladly
keep
around
during
the
summer
drinkability
is
good
i
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
these
over
the
summer
and
its
one
of
the
best
summer
brews
ive
tried
yet
this
tasted
more
like
a
slightly
better
version
of
macro
brewery
pilsner
im
suprised
a
beer
like
this
came
from
this
troegs
i
could
throw
this
down
all
day
really
very
well
done
and
a
fantastic
version
of
the
style
another
winner
here
needs
more
malt
less
of
that
sulfurous
character
drinkability
very
sessionable
this
is
a
great
beer
for
relaxing
outside
with
during
the
summer
d
pa
is
supposed
to
be
a
great
state
for
pilsners
im
just
now
begininning
to
appreciate
that
fact
good
stuff
from
troegs
this
is
one
easy
drinking
pilsner
not
too
much
of
anything
a
perfect
blend
overall
light
and
simple
so
this
is
beyond
sessionable
a
perfect
summer
beer
grab
a
case
of
these
with
one
case
each
of
victorys
prima
pils
sly
foxs
pikeland
pils
and
stoudts
pils
and
your
german
summer
of
drinking
is
set
a
great
pilsner
right
behind
prima
malt
flavor
lacks
a
little
i
feel
but
the
hops
are
very
powerful
spicy
and
work
great
here
a
fantastic
pils
great
german
pils
great
beer
d
a
refreshing
lagerexcellent
pils
which
was
complimentary
to
the
battered
jalapeno
and
shrimp
scampi
appetizer
the
spiciness
was
tasty
with
nice
drinkability
cutting
the
grease
and
refreshing
the
palate
light
body
with
a
good
amount
of
carbonation
very
little
trace
of
alcohol
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshing
in
the
heat
like
i
said
a
real
nice
summer
beer
in
all
honesty
i
dont
think
that
pilseners
get
the
respect
that
they
deserve
nowadays
since
i
also
drink
alot
of
wine
as
well
as
beer
i
feel
pretty
confident
that
i
can
compare
pilseners
to
rieslings
because
they
are
so
simple
and
basic
they
are
often
looked
over
and
i
am
as
guilty
as
anyone
sometimes
its
nice
to
have
a
beer
that
isnt
so
complex
that
you
need
two
pieces
of
paper
to
write
down
all
the
different
tasting
notes
that
it
contains
in
a
world
of
imperial
this
and
double
that
its
nice
to
know
that
i
can
always
crack
open
a
pilsener
to
remind
of
how
simple
life
can
really
be
not
having
had
too
many
craft
pilsner
beers
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
at
how
complex
this
beer
was
especially
the
smell
that
said
i
dont
think
it
is
completely
my
cup
of
tea
though
im
looking
forward
to
trying
other
good
examples
of
the
style
d
really
good
mildnonintense
flavor
and
easy
to
take
down
d
very
drinkable
perfect
for
a
nice
hot
day
easy
to
session
impressively
tasty
d
a
nice
light
and
refreshing
beer
for
warm
weather
days
but
not
a
standout
in
terms
of
flavor
and
taste
calling
this
a
fine
session
beer
would
be
a
bit
of
an
understatement
i
dont
know
if
id
rank
this
as
high
as
victorys
prima
pils
but
its
certainly
up
there
with
brooklyns
pils
and
better
than
the
mainstream
imports
d
a
terrific
german
pilsner
in
all
categories
except
mouthfeel
the
complete
absence
of
carbonation
seriously
degrades
an
other
wise
excellent
brew
great
appearance
along
with
a
good
nose
and
taste
are
unjustly
lost
as
a
result
d
very
very
drinkable
this
may
be
my
go
to
beer
this
summer
well
at
least
the
next
cupple
of
weeks
drinkability
an
excellent
summertime
beer
perfect
for
relaxing
on
a
warm
night
or
quenching
your
thirst
after
doing
some
yard
work
very
drinkable
sunshine
pilsner
from
troegs
is
my
top
rated
pilsner
i
only
drink
pilsners
in
the
summer
and
this
is
my
go
to
followed
a
close
second
by
prima
d
very
enjoyable
beer
i
was
craving
a
pilsner
last
week
so
i
grabbed
a
six
pack
very
nice
warm
weather
beer
bottle
pours
a
clear
light
yellow
with
a
small
white
head
aroma
of
wheat
pale
lager
malts
and
sweet
light
fruits
flavor
is
quite
similar
sweet
and
fruity
upfront
with
a
maltybready
finish
a
little
boring
just
a
basic
pilsener
lacking
in
originality
on
the
other
hand
for
a
pils
it
gets
the
job
done
d
delicious
light
and
easydrinking
great
summer
seasonal
fairly
thirstquenching
abv
is
probably
borderline
high
for
a
session
beer
but
i
could
definitely
see
having
more
than
one
of
these
in
a
session
picked
up
a
six
pack
of
this
figuring
it
its
from
troegs
it
should
be
quite
good
now
this
style
is
not
a
favorite
of
mine
but
i
feel
what
troegs
has
done
here
is
very
good
poured
to
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
goodsized
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
a
good
while
leaving
some
lacing
down
the
side
of
the
glass
the
aroma
at
least
to
me
seems
to
be
a
little
more
in
the
face
than
other
pils
that
i
have
tried
lemony
hops
are
there
and
i
notice
that
first
but
then
the
saaz
hop
spice
aroma
slight
grain
aroma
there
seems
sweet
but
it
goes
well
with
the
hops
i
am
picking
up
the
flavors
are
also
quite
refreshing
with
a
sweet
malty
flavor
taking
my
first
notice
hops
break
in
and
seem
to
add
more
of
a
lemon
zest
that
sticks
around
in
your
mouth
nice
brew
not
a
favorite
style
but
based
on
what
i
have
had
in
the
past
this
is
very
good
very
easy
drinking
brew
would
be
a
great
brew
to
enjoy
on
the
deck
during
the
summer
light
body
smooth
good
carbonation
finishes
dry
and
has
good
drinkability
this
would
be
a
very
good
summer
beer
there
beer
is
moderately
carbonated
light
bodied
refreshing
quite
dry
a
touch
lemon
tartness
but
then
we
get
to
that
spicy
hop
bite
this
is
made
from
saaz
hops
for
sure
and
there
is
that
graininess
you
would
come
to
expect
the
spicy
bite
is
just
too
much
for
this
beer
and
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
the
beer
is
not
bad
but
not
my
favorite
pils
sunshine
pilsner
along
with
victory
prima
pils
and
sly
fox
pikeland
pils
are
3
staples
in
my
fridge
over
the
summer
months
gotta
love
living
so
close
to
some
great
pa
breweries
drinkability
this
is
perfectly
refreshing
summer
beer
between
this
and
oskar
blues
i
am
becoming
more
of
a
fan
of
this
style
a
little
bitter
as
a
pils
but
it
also
does
not
taste
like
a
run
of
the
mill
pilsner
i
could
easily
session
this
d
this
beer
was
made
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
hot
summer
sun
by
the
gallon
a
refreshing
beer
easy
to
drink
and
a
lite
mouthfeel
compared
to
other
pils
there
is
a
bitterness
from
hops
that
is
very
present
but
not
very
appealing
or
tasty
a
fair
representative
of
its
style
but
not
the
best
prima
pils
gets
the
nod
here
lots
of
carbonation
prickly
light
to
medium
body
a
nice
pils
served
in
a
pint
glass
poured
a
bright
golden
yellow
crystal
clear
veeeery
little
head
if
any
at
all
smells
pilseneresque
but
no
distinct
fruit
or
hop
aroma
light
mouthfeel
super
light
mouthfeel
actually
watery
reeeally
watery
a
little
bitterness
in
the
finish
but
no
real
flavor
maybe
some
barely
there
hops
refreshing
but
doesnt
taste
like
anything
bummer
drinkability
really
high
this
is
a
great
summer
beer
thats
tasty
without
being
heavy
for
such
a
light
bodied
and
light
colored
beer
this
one
sure
delivers
the
goods
great
flavor
nice
and
crisp
and
highly
drinkable
i
would
say
this
and
victory
prima
pils
are
the
two
best
pils
i
have
had
highly
recommended
great
mouth
and
drinkability
like
any
pils
is
d
at
5
3
it
is
very
drinkable
ive
been
on
a
pilsner
binge
recently
so
i
thought
id
give
this
one
a
try
cheap
for
a
six
pack
but
they
are
local
very
clear
light
gold
almost
no
head
or
lacing
sweet
almost
fruity
aroma
definite
citrus
or
lemony
taste
very
light
and
summery
now
if
only
the
weather
would
improve
i
could
definitely
enjoy
this
one
out
on
the
porch
3
5
d
good
stuff
except
for
the
appearance
overall
a
very
good
pilsner
10
for
a
sixpack
is
a
little
on
the
steep
side
though
hv
drinkability
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
drinkable
beer
each
sip
followed
easily
from
the
last
and
i
could
drink
them
all
night
or
for
several
nights
in
a
row
i
poured
the
beer
into
a
pilsener
glass
with
a
very
small
head
small
enough
it
need
not
mention
the
body
is
golden
and
clear
the
aroma
smells
of
light
hops
i
took
a
swig
of
the
beer
and
it
tasted
just
as
a
pilsener
should
however
it
didnt
overly
impress
me
with
its
hoppy
complexion
the
beer
was
enjoyable
to
drink
however
i
found
myself
not
really
wanting
more
maybe
it
was
my
mood
not
sure
but
i
am
more
of
a
fan
of
troegs
nugget
nectar
and
double
bock
a
12
ounce
bottle
purchased
at
the
beer
stop
in
west
hazleton
for
1
75
poured
into
my
tröegs
shaker
pint
glass
and
appears
a
crystal
clear
bright
yellow
color
with
two
fingers
of
pure
white
foam
the
head
leaves
no
lacing
to
speak
of
smells
and
tastes
of
grassy
hops
a
generous
dose
of
lemon
earthy
bready
yeast
ultra
crisp
and
quaff
able
a
notch
above
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
a
great
warm
weather
pilsner
i
love
pilsners
and
found
another
to
add
to
my
list
of
possibilities
now
i
have
to
decide
between
prima
slyfox
and
sunshine
every
time
im
thirsty
for
a
pils
overall
im
not
impressed
i
noted
that
based
on
some
other
reviews
ive
read
i
may
have
had
a
bad
bottle
but
the
beer
appeared
to
be
fine
and
didnt
taste
skunked
pilseners
are
supposed
to
be
richly
hopped
and
flavorful
i
dont
think
troegs
is
doing
the
style
justice
if
my
sample
was
an
accurate
one
d
easy
drinker
but
the
aftertaste
isnt
exactly
pleasant
does
however
make
you
go
back
for
more
d
pretty
high
this
would
be
on
regular
rotation
for
me
if
it
was
a
yearround
beer
generally
american
pils
are
not
especially
impressive
and
with
a
case
of
stoudts
in
the
fridge
this
had
a
hard
task
in
front
of
it
but
it
is
a
very
good
beer
one
of
the
best
ive
had
from
troegs
a
definite
must
have
in
the
fridge
now
i
guess
there
is
something
i
am
missing
from
this
style
maybe
i
needto
go
to
germany
or
the
czech
republic
another
great
sepa
pilsner
up
there
with
prima
and
sly
fox
less
hoppy
than
i
expected
but
a
great
brew
excellent
for
warm
weather
d
easy
to
drink
but
a
mediocre
flavor
good
drinkable
beer
d
the
drinkability
is
here
on
this
one
this
was
great
to
have
on
a
sunny
85
day
and
besides
you
cant
go
wrong
with
troegs
good
hop
presence
in
the
taste
some
raw
grain
not
as

this
is

theres
other

out

that
i
like
better

i
would
drink
this

probably

d
i
would
prefer
this
a
touch
colder
than
i
have
it
served
right
now
but
out
side
of
that
its
very
clean
and
refreshing
i
think
the
only
beer
in
this
style
that
i
like
better
so
far
is
prima
pils
this
is
very
refreshing
and
as
a

its

i
am
revising
this
post
because
i
have
had
this
more
recently
and
have
not
been
nearly
as
impressed
it
was
better
last
year
this
year
it
has
a
metallic
taste
its
not
bad
but
not
nearly
as
good
as
it
resides
in
my
memories
of
years
past
tastes
lemon
zesty
smooth
surprisingly
full
bodied
carbonation
at
a
nice
level
get
some
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
but
overall
this
remains
a
pleasant
easy
drinker
and
likely
going
to
become
a
go
to
for
when
i
have
people
over
might
be
nice
to
get
a
case
of
this
to
divert
people
from
my
cellar
basically
when
a
beer
is
called
sunshine
pils
this
is
exactly
what
ought
to
be
expected
zesty
citrus
and
earthy
floral
flavors
with
a
strong
hops
back
lets
not
forget
that
the
label
touts
this
beer
as
being
hoppy
it
is
everything
it
claims
just
barely
a

well
with
many
foods
o
a
typical
czech
pils
but
from
belgium
overall
this
is
you
average
premium
euro
lager
easy
to
drink
and
quenches
your
thirst
but
at
8
99
for
six
pack
of
11
2
oz
of
beer
is
very
disappointing
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
lager
it
is
just
there
are
better
or
equal
lagers
on
the
market
it
is
crisp
and
clean
but
too
thin
to
be
interesting
i
really
hope
i
only
bought
one
of
these
because
i
dont
ever
really
want
another
i
would
just
as
soon
drink
a
pabst
and
i
would
rather
have
a
rolling
rock
as
with
other
styles
even
with
a
bad
style
i
prefer
american
versions
o
not
exactly
a
groundbreaking
beer
but
pretty
well
done
nonetheless
this
was
a
pretty
good
beer
relatively
light
and
very
easy
to
drink
overall
this
is
a
pretty
average
pilsner
nothing
special
but
a
great
thirst
quencher
overall
this
is
a
decent
little
run
found
on
an
around
the
world
challenge
and
given
a
good
once
over
by
yours
truly
overall
45
as
i
said
not
a
huge
fan
of
pilsener
but
this
one
would
serve
as
a
good
session
beer
that
i
wouldnt
mind
drinking
a
few
of
makes
me
think
there
is
hope
for
pilseners
after
all
t
the
malt
elegance
of
german
lagers
here
is
met
with
the
dryfruity
spicy
bite
of
belgian
pale
ales
for
a
truely
unique
and
thirst
quenching
session
a
job
well
done
by
bavik
if
you
love
the
style
its
a
must
try
prosit
presentation
packaged
in
an
11
2
ounce
brown
glass
long
neck
bottle
with
a
popoff
crown
served
in
a
standard
pilsener
glass
pretty
crisp
up
front
with
plenty
of
bubbles
and
mild
hop
flavors
middle
is
grainy
and
a
little
sweet
with
the
bready
yeast
kicking
in
finishes
dryish
with
a
decent
bitterness
this
is
not
totally
unlike
stella
shares
some
of
the
same
hop
characteristics
and
the
yeast
is
more
notable
in
both
than
the
czechgerman
pilseners
it
is
pretty
tasty
and
pretty
affordable
for
a
12pack
id
be
just
as
happy
with
a
bavik
as
a
warsteiner
or
bitburger
o
started
off
well
with
a
nice
appearance
and
nose
but
the
flavor
fell
short
overall
i
found
this
in
my
mixed
sixer
place
and
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
wouldnt
be
my
go
to
beer
since
it
was
kind
of
old
and
carbonation
was
low
but
it
was
a
decent
beer
drinkable
o
for
belgian
pilsner
this
is
as
good
as
it
gets
one
to
seek
out
if
youre
a
fan
of
the
style
while
i
have
to
consider
that
this
styleor
any
lighter
lagerwill
take
a
beating
as
an
import
this
is
a
good
effort
albeit
nothing
more
than
what
was
to
be
expected
pours
a
light
straw
color
with
very
slight
haze
large
white
foamy
head
and
a
light
wispy
sticky
lace
smell
from
the
bottle
was
not
bad
but
in

smelt
like

some

drink
wasnt
all
bad
still
a
bit
different
to
have
a
belgian
beer
in
the
shape
of
a
german
pilsner
some
hints
of
fruit
and
minerals
in
the
aroma
the
flavor
references
dayold
french
bread
with
a
touch
of
bitter
orange
wedded
to
a
pleasant
hop
profile
overall
a
welcome
greeting
to
the
mouth
and
a
suitable
partner
for
some
empanadas
or
pot
stickers
not
something
to
impress
the
guests
with
though
drinkability
a
pretty
standard
lager
i
was
honestly
hoping
for
more
from
a
pilsener
from
belgium
but
honestly
there
is
nothing
to
set
this
beer
apart
from
stella
and
its
ilk
you
can
find
much
better
for
much
cheaper
d
slightly
disappointing
pours
a
hazy
light
yellow
color
with
a
frothy
one
to
one
and
a
half
finger
head
which
gives
way
to
some
lacing
the
aroma
is
of
citrus
and
sweet
malts
the
taste
has
a
nice
sweet
malt
backbone
with
hints
of
breadiness
and
a
slight
hop
bite
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
overall
it
is
a
very
solid
beer
it
is
an
easy
drink
with
a
nice
flavor
to
keep
you
wanting
more
drinkability
a
nice
smooth
nonchallenging
but
still
a
bit
flavorful
bavik
pils
hits
the
spot
for
me
d
this
is
an
okay
german
pils
but
ive
had
better
d
this
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
refreshing
and
rather
sessionable
its
a
perfect
beer
to
begin
the
night
with
because
it
opens
up
your
palate
from
the
11

fl
oz
bottle
no

sampled
on
june

2010
it
pours
a
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
with
a
short
burst
of
fizzy
offwhite
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
grains
with
thin
hops
and
a
slight
skunkiness
the
mouthfeel
is
about
medium
the
taste
is
also
more
grainy
than
anything
else
with
a
bit
of
creaminess
and
a
faint
hint
of
hops
at
the
end
it
leaves
an
aftertaste
this
beer
is
hard
to
compare
to
anything
else
id
say
the
closest
i
could
compare
it
to
is
carlsberg
maybe
but
it
has
a
very
different
feel
i
like
drinking
this
beer
but
i
am
probably
not
going
to
get
it
in
the
future
because
its
hard
to
find
and
its
not
cheap
there
are
better
german
lagers
out
there
for
less
money
also
id
be
more
inclined
to
buy
it
if
it
came
in
a
12
oz
bottle
instead
of
these
stupid
11
2
0z
ones
overall
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
something
to
call

about
it

to
rate
this
one
do
i
give
it
a
good
grade
for
its
unique
take
on

do
i
knock
it
for
being
untrue
to
the
pils
style
all
i
know
is
i
enjoyed
it
hefes
arent
my
favorite
thing
and
pilsner
can
sometimes
be
boring
or
have
an
unpleasant
aftertaste
in
my
eyes
this
is
a
nice
marriage
of
the
two
styles
taking
the
best
of
both
worlds
but
beware
this
is
not
your
classic
pils
and
some
people
wont
like
that
d
the
low
abv
and
general
lightness
make
this
an
easy
drinker
not
the
most
complex
pils
out
there
but
pretty
decent
mouthfeel
was
multitextured
there
was
a
light
burn
and
it
was
thinner
than
expected
however
it
finished

was

he
told
me
that
stella

is
what
they
drink
in
america
and
bavik
is
what
they
drink
in
belgium
be
that
as
it
may
theres
a

still
a

than

some
peppery

bite
towards

maybe
a
touch

dry
florals
in

of

there
is
definitely
a
snappy
pepperishness
towards

the
aftertaste

pretty
non

the
beer
is
very
light
on

good

a

goes

not

filling
mild

decent
representation
of
style
its
not
one
of
the
better
beers
that
ive
had
in
the

ive
certainly
had
a
lot
worse
md
mouthfeel
is
nice

easy
nothing
offensive
very
wet
on

finishes
smoothly

drinkable

not
crisp

enough
ontap
in

the
aroma
was
a
bit
funky
like
farmhouse
character
at
first
but
that
gave
way
to
very
clean
malts
too
clean
i
could
hardly
taste
them
followed
by
very
very
earthy
hops
with
orange
rind
carraway
seed
and
a
musty
earthiness
worth
a
try
when
better
options
arent
available
d
easily
drinkable
and
not
unpleasant
but
there
are
some
significant
flaws
that
hurt
my
overall
impression
of
the
beer
the
apple
aroma
is
hard
to
ignore
and
obscures
an
otherwise
nice
pilsner
character
this
is
hardly
the
worst
pils
out
there
but
it
shouldnt
be
hard
to
find
a
better
one
first
aroma
has
fruity
esters
very
orange
along
with
a
good
malt
backbone
quaff
is
getting
back
to
pilsner
malt
and
taste
but
still
a
long
way
off
but
i
guess
this
is
just
the
belgium
interpretation
of
pilsner
unfortunately
it
doesnt
work
well
with
me
glad
this
was
a
one
11
2oz
bottle
for
sample
wouldnt
want
a
sixer
of
these
pours
a
clear
golden
color
good
23
inch
head
with
decent
retention
and
good
lacing
smells
of
mostly
lager
and
some
malt
fits
the
style
smooth
with
low
carbonation
slightly
thick
mouth
feel
good
malt
taste
upfront
with
a
good
lager
background
also
a
very
slight
hop
taste
in
there
as
well
slightly
watery
for
my
taste
could
have
been
stronger
overall
not
a
bad
example
of
a
german
pilsner
im
glad
i
tried
it
drinkability
if
i
had
to
choose
a
pilsner
and
i
could
choose
anything
i
would
probably
pick
this
one
been
on
a
pilsner
kick
lately
something
about
that
crisp
taste
that
fills
a
void
after
youve
been
hitting
the
big
beers
for
a
while
picked
these
up
in
a
six
pack
of
cans
which
i
can
see
coming
in
very
handy
at
the
lake
next
summer
kudos
to
craft
breweries
who
are
busting
out
the
cans
a
hazy
golden
pour
finishes
with
a
twofinger
quickly
fading
offwhite
head
theres
a
streaky
lacing
left
behind
you
get
a
little
skunk
on
the
nose
at
first
but
no
the
offputting
kind
which
you
get
with
some
brews
smells
a
little
sweet
malty
and
medicinal
as
well
tastes
sweet
and
malty
and
not
as
crisp
as
expected
it
could
have
been
a
bit
bigger
on
the
hops
at
the
end
which
usually
balances
things
off
really
good
pilsners
have
to
pull
that
off
well
in
my
book
its
highly
carbonated
according
to
the
style
and
pretty
drinkable
overall
although
a
bit
lacking
in
the
taste
and
mouthfeel
departments
and
a
bit
softer
around
the
edges
than
i
like
in
a
pilsner
this
is
about
average
in
drinkability
i
wish
it
were
a
bit
stronger
in
the
taste
area
i
had
one
bottle
and
while
there
was
nothing
offensive
about
it
one
bottle
is
really
all
id
care
to
have
there
simply
are
many
beers
of
this
type
out
there
which
are
far
more
enjoyable
golden
brew
with
thin
white
head
head
dies
down
too
quickly
a
bit
too
still
as
well
the
scent
of
sweat
pale
malt
and
noble
musty
hops
the
taste
follows
similar
lines
the
flavors
are
crisp
clean
and
overall
subtle
only
knock
is
that
it
is
not
quite
rich
or
big
enough
to
make
me
do
back
flips
however
this
is
the
type
of
flavor
smoothness
the
american
macros
could
only
hop
for
poured
a
pale
hazy
yellow
color
with
a
thin
head
smelled
of
spices
and
some
citrus
hops
tasted
the
same
a
nice
conservative
blend
of
citrus
wheat
with
some
spiced
hops
a
slight
zing
to
the
tongue
on
some
drinks
went
down
decently
just
didnt
desire
another
mainly
inoffensive
outside
of
slight
metallic
touch
soft
and
easy
enough
for
a
throw
it
back
thirstquencher
but
thats
about
all
it
is
but
not
bad
for
that
drinkability
is
ok
here
im
not
too
impressed
but
its
inoffensive
and
goes
down
well
i
can
say
that
ive
had
better
examples
though
i
got
this
brew
from
by
the
bottle
in
vancouver
wa
in
standard
12
oz
bottle
im
a
pilsener
and
a
belgian
fan
so
this
was
a
must
try
poored
like
a
standard
pils
and
about
right
for
the
style
but
the
individual
bubbles
were
bigger
and
dissipated
quicker
nose
was
almost
a
bit
earthy
and
reminded
me
of
tomatoes
for
some
reason
saaz
hops
or
something
similar
were
faintly
apparent
taste
is
good
and
within
the
style
but
a
bit
more
saaz
hopiness
would
add
to
the
brew
mouthfeel
is
medium
but
the
carbonation
is
a
bit
light
overall
this
is
decent
brew
and
should
be
tried
by
my
fellow
pils
and
belgian
fans
d
not
sure
if
i
would
purchase
again
but
interesting
none
the
less
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
light
in
body
with
a
dry
finish
carbonation
is
about
where
it
should
be
this
is
an
easy
drinking
beer
but
i
dont
see
anything
that
would
really
draw
me
back
to
it
nothing
outstanding
nothing
damning
it
is
a
good
beer
quite
unique
with
that
little
belgian
twinge
coming
from
the
yeast
give
it
a
try
really
good
stuff
12
ounce
can
pale
golden
color
thin
white
foam
that
lasts
well
nose
shows
some
light
malts
a
touch
of
vinous
character
and
some
grassy
hops
really
clean
nose
flavor
has
some
bready
malty
character
and
some
tangy
slightly
citrus
hops
well
balanced
clean
lager
note
hard
to
find
anything
positive
to
say
about
this
one
dsimple
but
very
enjoyablei
could
enjoy
this
easy
drinker
again
and
again
not
one
to
seek
out
but
never
the
less
a
good
pils
certainly
a
step
or
two
above
the
macro
euro
lagers
easy
to
drink
due
to
its
abv
and
very
smooth
and
light
body
the
ease
with
which
you
can
throw
this
brew
down
might
be
the
best
part
about
it
very
average
beer
average
in
appearance
smell
taste
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
nothing
special
to
report
just
that
it
went
down
easy
and
i
would
recommend
having
it
served
extra
cold
the
only
interesting
thing
that
i
could
say
about
it
was
that
it
tasted
very
honeylike
im
not
sure
why
but
the
beer
had
a
definite
honey
flavor
to
it
nice
euro
lager
its
not
bad
and
im
okay
with
paying
around
6
for
a
6
pack
i
will
finish
this
six
pack
of
course
but
i
probably
wont
get
this
again
especially
at
9
a
sixer
11
2oz
brown
bottle
from
rons
in
farmington
pours
a
translucent
light
straw
color
with
a
good
inch
of
white
head
that
dissipates
leaving
a
fair
bit
of
lacing
smells
fruity
with
caramel
malt
yeast
and
hints
of
dms
tastes
malty
sweet
with
almost
a
citric
or
grapelike
component
just
the
slightest
hint
of
cooked
vegetable
with
a
fairly
clean
finish
light
mouthfeel
with
effervescent
carbonation
not
as
hoppy
as
ive
come
to
expect
from
the
style
but
otherwise
a
decent
easydrinking
pils
that
beats
the
heck
out
of
most
eurolagers
imo
bavik
pours
piss
yellow
with
some
carbonation
the
nose
is
very
grainy
and
smells
of
wheat
and
some
malt
the
taste
is
simple
and
grainy
wheatfunk
and
some
weak
spice
mouthfeel
is
thin
and
watery
as
expected
and
the
drinkability
would
be
that
of
water
but
is
too
funky
not
a
terrible
beer
but
nothing
i
would
drink
again
when
i
can
just
grab
an
urquell
ick
bordering
on
drain
pour
drinkability
drinkable
but
dont
buy
a
sixer
drinkability
great
session
brew
the
flavor
in
this
beer
is
superior
to
stella
artois
too
bad
it
is
not
as
widely
available
overall
i
have
had
this
beer
on
tap
once
before
and
kind
of
liked
the
on
tap
version
a
little
better
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
this
happens
to
be
my
favorite
tapwerks
local
pub
beer
on
tap
overall
the
bottle
seemed
to
be
good
to
the
taste
also
had
the
white
beer
as
well
note
i
had
a
beer
on
a
royal
carribean
cruise
called
royale
that
is
suspected
to
be
a
renamed
version
of
palm
from
belgium
and
this
brew
is
very
similar
to
that
bavik
pils
pours
a
golden
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
that
laces
nicely
from
an
11
2
ounce
can
the
aroma
isnt
great
there
isnt
anything
too
off
putting
but
it
almost
smells
like
a
macro
it
clearly
isnt
though
but
there
is
a
very
sweet
malt
presence
and
a
not
very
appealing
mild
hop
smell
the
more
i
smell
it
the
more
i
just
pick
up
the
sweet
malt
i
like
the
malt
in
the
flavor
its
strong
enough
to
give
this
beer
a
good
flavor
in
the
pils
style
but
the
hops
are
all
wrong
for
a
pils
they
are
kind
of
weak
and
not
especially
flavorful
kind
of
leaving
an
odd
bitterness
toward
the
finish
that
being
said
it
is
very
light
doesnt
actually
taste
bad
and
actually
im
coming
to
kind
of
like
it
i
think
the
cans
may
be
a
blessing
for
this
beer
it
could
probably
skunk
easily
which
would
really
hurt
it
this
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
better
than
i
expected
this
beer
pours
a
healthy
white
head
that
slowly
fades
to
an
island
of
foam
a
respectable
lace
clings
and
stays
macro
yellow
in
color
with
a
greenish
haze
the
smell
is
pretty
clean
except
for
a
faint
belgian
mustiness
which
i
really
liked
taste
is
more
of
the
same
fairly
clean
crisp
and
really
easy
to
quaff
all
in
all
bavik
is
a
great
beer
even
if
it
isnt
quite
true
to
style
poured
into
a
pilsner
a
light
spritzy
yellow
with
a
large
blooming
white
head
that
settled
very
very
slowly
leaving
globs
of
lace
behind
light
residual
sweetness
a
bit
of
metallic
and
firm
toasted
malt
in
the
nose
nothing
earth
shattering
or
out
of
the
ordinary
but
it
could
be
worse
thin
near
watery
mouthfeel
the
beer
glides
down
almost
like
water
wich
isnt
the
worse
thing
in
the
world
but
obviously
i
think
most
would
want
more
bodyslightly
sweet
and
toasty
with
a
bit
of
a
herb
smack
in
the
finisheh
its
not
horrible
its
better
than
some
other
european
giants
but
still
it
lacks
alot
i
wasnt
expecting
much
from
this
beer
but
to
be
honest
its
not
a
bad
euro
lager
the
goldenyellow
appearance
and
grainy
malt
smell
wont
change
your
mind
too
much
and
while
the
flavor
is
generic
enough
not
to
really
stand
out
it
is
completely
inoffensive
to
the
point
where
its
enjoyable
a
slightly
sweet
malty
taste
emerges
with
just
the
slightest
sense
of
bitterness
personally
i
like
this
better
than
stella
and
it
is
decent
for
a
euro
lager
overall
this
is
a
nice
pilsner
it
doesnt
really
stand
out
too
much
but
it
is
well
done
poured
strait
into
the
glass
a
very
water
fizzy
looking
golden
color
the
upside
is
that
the
head
retains
fairly
well
and
leaves
some
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
of
wheat
fairly
bland
smells
similar
to
typical
mass
proudced
american
beers
the
taste
is
not
objectionable
but
doesnt
seem
to
be
distinct
at
all
not
what
i
was
expecting
very
fizzy
and
thin
the
mouthfeel
is
highly
carbonated
and
thin
overall
this
beer
is
very
drinkable
which
is
its
upside
i
wouldnt
recommend
trying
it
unless
you
get
it
for
free
i
certainly
wont
be
purchasing
it
again
overall
nothing
too
special
here
decent
for
a
backyard
cookout
on
a
hot
day
but
i
know
i
can
come
up
with
better
examples
of
the
style
to
whet
my
whistle
pours
a
light
gold
a
bit
yellow
with
constant
upward
bubbles
and
a
light
dusting
of
head
doughy
and
a
tad
minty
on
the
nose
with
a
little
bit
of
urine
on
the
palate
a
bit
tight
and
minty
first
off
with
some
rough
papery
notes
in
the
middle
that
maintain
a
saaz
tang
until
the
end
mouthfeel
is
good
for
the
style
smoothness
overlaid
with
some
jagged
hop
oils
overall
this
is
alright
and
theres
nothing
really
out
of
whack
here
but
things
dont
quite
gel
either
grabbed
a
single
bottle
martys
in
newton
ma
poured
a
pale
yellow
hue
with
a
minimal
white
head
not
much
in
the
aroma
department
even
though
its
supposed
to
be
a
lager
i
still
got
a
slight
spice
and
fruit
smell
if
you
really
stick
your
nose
in
it
i
paired
this
beer
with
a
pastrami
on
rye
sandwich
that
really
hit
the
spot
this
beer
is
not
really
one
of
my
favorites
but
it
is
definetley
above
average
for
the
style
good
session
beer
this
belgian
pilsner
is
a
better
one
than
others
it
does
not
have
the
fame
of
others
but
it
is
always
looked
over
a
great
color
a
decent
nose
and
standard
pilsner
tastes
a
bit
sweeter
even
not
one
of
my
favorite
styles
but
it
is
still
better
than
some
drinkability
its
far
from
an
amazing
pilsner
but
its
more
than
serviceable
at
its
trader
joes
price
there
are
some
beers
in
my
fridge
that
im
only
going
to
drink
when
i
absolutely
have
to
this
was
kind
of
one
of
them
but
i
think
i
chose
well
it
turned
out
ok
d
alright
it
is
a
pilsener
i
am
not
really
a
pilsener
fan
but
it
is
better
than
most
of
them
for
sure
a
creamy
drinkable
and
tasty
lager
with
some
yeast
in
it
a
find
at
eagle
provisions
in
nyc
yellow
with
some
cloudiness
in
it
some
white
head
and
drops
of
lace
smooth
drinking
offset
some
spicey
food
smartly
malted
a
versatile
beer
i
think
this
beer
is
underated
easy
to
drink
has
a
smooth
clean
taste
and
little
residual
aftertaste
bavik
pils
is
firmly
in
line
with
the
older
more
traditional
often
but
not
always
unfiltered
lagers
and
pilseners
of
central
and
eastern
europe
many
of
which
have
recently
been
imported
in
some
numbers
for
the
first
time
in
years
so
if
youve
got
a
sense
of
adventure
and
dont
mind
spending
two
bits
more
than
your
average
sixer
of
becks
or
saint
pauli
girl
this
is
wellworth
checking
out
the
mouth
is
light
and
clean
and
after
a
burst
of
bitter
hops
actually
gets
creamy
on
the
end
this
is
a
very
drinkable
brew
even
if
it
doesnt
really
posess
a
wealth
of
personality
not
a
great
pilsner
but
a
good
one
and
a
variation
on
the
style
that
is
unique
a
light
golden
color
with
a
quater
inch
head
that
forms
with
visible
carbonation
the
surprising
scent
of
floral
hops
hits
my
nose
folowed
by
some
roasted
barley
but
a
pleasant
aroma
the
taste
what
happened
to
the
hops
a
very
malty
mild
flavor
there
was
no
sign
of
the
hops
in
the
taste
watery
a
very
thin
mouthfeel
with
a
slight
tingle
from
the
carbonation
overall
the
smell
was
nice
but
it
seemed
to
slack
off
after
that
surprise
great
pilsner
mellow
refreshing
taste
with
nice
mouthfeel
but
slightly
watery
body
finish
is
decently
dry
pretty
decent
attempt
at
the
style
the
history
of
brouwerij
bavik
and
of
this
particular
beer
is
fascinating
too
bad
bavik
pils
is
anything
but
its
an
decent
little
lager
but
there
are
scores
of
german
czech
and
belgian
pilseners
that
have
it
beat
any
day
of
the
week
it
isnt
really
worth
your
time
unless
youre
a
pils
popper
probably
not
even
then
im
afraid
i
couldnt
see
the
beer
through
the
can
and
didnt
have
any
opportunity
for
pouring
it
into
a
glass
as
i
was
drinking
it
in
an
alley
adjecent
to
an
auto
repair
shop
i
had
a
notably
crisp
clean
and
lightly
grassy
flavor
rare
for
most
belgian
pils
ive
had
i
was
having
me
a
good
old
time
with
a
friend
and
this
beer
was
the
perfect
accompaniment
for
the
first
warm
spring
day
we
spent
drinking
outdoors
it
actually
had
some
body
to
it
as
well
it
has
since
gone
up
in
price
by
two
dollars
per
six
pack
cans
at
my
local
shop
i
think
ill
switch
to
dales
pale
ale
in
the
can
for
a
dollar
less
drinkability
certainly
a
nice
summer
quaffer
but
at
7
for
a
sixer
of
cans
theres
better
value
out
there
fairly
drinkable
worth
a
try
if
you
like
pils
i
could
also
see
this
beer
working
well
on
a
hot
day
it
is
more
flavorful
than
bmc
and
its
ilk
plus
i
can
buy
it
in
cans
fairly
cheap
i
have
no
qualms
drinking
this
i
purchased
my
bottle
in
council
bluffs
ia
i
think
ill
have
to
get
more
a
well
made
german
pils
poured
out
to
a
hazed
light
yellow
color
with
a
medium
head
of
foam
that
dissipated
rather
fast
a
good
amount
of
lace
was
present
and
streams
of
champagnelike
bubbles
surge
toward
the
surface
well
after
the
initial
pour
aromas
of
light
malt
and
hops
with
some
grain
and
sweet
corn
notes
very
fresh
taste
is
light
bodied
and
very
quaffable
malt
corn
dry
hops
subtle
notes
of
hay
and
sweetness
mouthfeel
was
slightly
bubbly
but
otherwise
forgetable
good
drinkability
very
refreshing
worth
trying
poured
a
blondish
bright
yellow
with
a
medium
to
thick
white
head
good
lacing
throughout
smells
strong
of
hops
but
i
detected
an
olivelike
scent
taste
was
surprising
as
it
was
very
fruity
and
for
a
light
beer
definately
worth
a
try
the
mouthfeel
was
subpar
but
overall
a
beer
one
could
enjoy
on
a
night
of
heavy
drinking
for
its
lightness
and
flavor
hey
this
isnt
bad
very
pale
and
light
bodied
nice
grassy
hop
aroma
very
consistent
with
euro
pils
mediumlow
bitterness
mediumhigh
carbonation
with
big
white
head
and
great
lacing
probably
one
of
the
best
beers
i
have
had
in
a
can
better
than
heineken
cans
and
obviuosly
better
than
bud
miller
etc
belch
non
existent
it
seems
11
2
oz
all
in
all
not
bad
however
there
are
a
host
of
solid
pilsners
that
i
would
reach
for
before
i
came
to
this
one
selection
of
the
beerofthemonth
club
poured
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
nice
white
puffy
head
that
lasted
throughout
the
glass
smell
is
slightly
sweet
with
some
piney
hops
detected
taste
is
nice
and
crisp
but
nothing
outstanding
high
carbonation
gives
a
mouth
fullness
that
leads
helps
to
make
it
refreshing
an
easy
drinker
best
used
as
an
expensive
spacer
aroma
has
a
nice
spicywoody
aspect
to
it
along
with
a
slightly
grainy
note
not
very
strongsmelling
but
probably
appropriate
for
style
the
flavor
is
clean
nicely
bitter
at
the
end
and
dry
with
a
mild
hop
and
malt
flavor
that
is
pleasant
although
a
little
underwhelming
the
balance
is
good
in
this
beer
its
refreshing
but
beefy
not
my
first
choice
but
for
the
style
id
say
its
pretty
good
overall
im
very
dissatisfied
with
this
beer
very
soft
and
clean
on
the
palate
grainy
sweet
mouthfeel
with
a
chalky
quality
sweetness
slight
hop
profile
and
grains
provide
for
a
clean
drinking
pilsner
draught
this
beer
poured
a
very
light
golden
color
it
was
crystal
clear
there
was
a
large
white
head
with
a
bit
of
lacing
the
aroma
wasnt
too
bad
it
was
mainly
floral
with
a
light
maltiness
to
it
the
taste
was
a
bit
light
but
fairly
good
there
was
almost
no
hop
bite
to
it
at
all
easy
drinking
but
fairly
nondescript
notes
traditionally
friends
and
i
start
most
evenings
out
sucking
down
a
couple
baviks
a
great
warm
up
beer
that
has
character
and
doesnt
get
boring
taste
is
slightly
sweeter
and
slightly
maltier
than
an
american
lager
cleaner
yet
more
interesting
too
and
a
nice
smooth
finish
that
requires
further
investigation
very
drinkable
with
all
that
said
i
dont
mind
this
beer
at
all
sure
its
not
a
trademark
pilsner
but
it
is
tasty
and
i
like
a
sweeter
flavor
to
a
pilsner
anyhow
plus
it
tastes
good
out
of
a
can
easy
drinking
decent
flavor
forget
the
fact
its
from
belgium
there
are
many
better
from
that
country
but
for
what
this
is
it
isnt
bad
at
all
solid
offering
id
buy
some
of
these
for
the
golf
course
lets
call
it
a
belgium
lager
though
hazy
sun
yellow
chunks
of
yeast
in
suspension
thin
ivory
white
head
nice
aroma
of
soft
bready
malts
and
flowery
hops
mediumfull
body
a
little
light
on
the
carbonation
for
a
pilsner
bready
malts
form
the
base
of
the
flavor
with
nice
saazlike
hop
tones
flowery
hops
add
a
nice
touch
pretty
decent
pilsner
especially
coming
from
a
can
drinkability
ok
for
a
quaffer
purchased
by
mistake
and
it
met
my
low
expectations
overall
i
have
had
this
before
many
many
times
in
belgium
and
i
honestly
think
its
one
of
the
better
for
the
masses
pils
out
there
its
clean
crisp
and
actually
has
some
pilslike
flavor
unlike
the
alkenmaes
and
jupiler
homegrown
contenders
if
only
bavik
to
get
this
more
widely
distributed
nothing
outstanding
but
certainly
not
one
of
the
worst
belgium
pils
on
the
market
i
think
i
will
try
the
cans
when
i
see
them
back
in
the
usa
picked
up
at
kahns
in
indy
on
a
whim
the
can
actually
reminded
me
a
little
of
brahma
especially
once
i
saw
cerveja
on
it
anyways
an
agressive
pour
leads
to
a
2
finger
white
head
with
large
soapy
bubbles
atop
a
straw
yellow
body
with
some
particles
in
suspension
nose
is
sweet
and
malty
much
like
a
typical
euro
lager
taste
finishes
a
tad
metallic
not
generally
pleasant
ill
probably
pass
on
this
one
next
time
not
bad
overall
but
nothing
special
its
probably
considerably
better
becaus
eof
its
brown
bottle
packaging
i
just
hope
there
isnt
anyone
out
there
who
thinks
this
is
representative
of
belgian
beer
this
beer
represents
the
notion
to
not
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
nothing
impressed
me
at
first
the
label
looked
cheap
appearance
was
nothing
impressive
very
pale
with
little
carbonation
no
aroma
to
speak
of
all
this
changed
from
the
first
sip
to
the
last
fantastic
light
taste
that
was
above
and
beyond
any
domestic
light
beers
or
even
pilsner
urquell
went
down
great
bought
this
in
a
mix
and
match
single
and
will
definitely
try
it
again
paid

for
the
bottle
pours
a
slightly
hazy
golden
pilsener
color
with
a
fluffy
white
head
yeasty
grassy
husky
and
bready
nose
rather
clean
smelling
tastes
rather
fruity
in
the
malt
and
the
bouquet
of
the
hops
ties
together
pretty
nicely
starts
rather
malty
sweet
then
theres
a
watery
portion
midpalate
and
a
faint
tartness
and
dryness
in
the
finish
very
atypical
for
a
euro
pils
but
it
seems
right
for
a
belgian
pils
possesses
unique
characteristics
the
the
interbrew
adulterated
version
is
missing
a
belgian
lager
i
havent
seen
many
of
these
before
so
i
decided
to
give
it
a
try
the
beer
appeared
very
lagerish
in
color
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
stayed
the
whole
time
i
drank
it
lots
of
bubbles
racing
to
the
top
but
not
much
lacing
this
beer
was
really
sweet
for
a
lagergerman
pils
the
upfront
sweetness
was
almost
too
much
for
me
but
it
had
a
really
smooth
mouthfeel
to
it
the
base
of
this
beer
was
grainy
and
sweet
as
well
the
hops
came
in
a
provided
a
profound
spicy
flavor
to
this
beer
it
seems
like
there
were
more
spices
clove
coriander
added
to
this
beer
at
the
end
of
the
fermentation
bc
it
was
almost
overly
spicy
in
the
finish
this
was
a
decent
beer
that
complemented
my
cherry
bbq
chicken
well
but
i
couldnt
drink
this
one
as
a
session
low
drinkability

i
refrained
from
dumping
this
with
a
shaking
hand
its
right
on
the
edge
slightly
hazy
pale
yellow
strange
for
a
lager
or
more
specifically
a
pilsner
head
is
very
light
and
rises
to
over
12
an
inch
very
fluffy
in
texture
decent
overall
lacing
on
the
glass
weird
yeasty
aroma
musty
with
some
nutmeg
and
grass
components
starts
light
and
perfumey
on
the
tongue
sweet
and
even
a
little
estery
no
real
hop
sense
body
thins
markedly
later
as
does
the
taste
but
strangely
theres
little
carbonation
and
a
weird
slick
sensation
thats
almost
like
flat
ginger
ale
a
very
odd
beer
for
style
almost
resembles
wittekerke
in
some
aspects
drinkability
not
too
complex
very
easy
to
drink
one
of
the
more
enjoyable
beers
ive
had
from
a
can
the
beer
pours
a
gold
color
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
average
it
boasts
of
mostly
pale
malts
and
lager
yeast
it
is
dry
and
hopped
sparingly
the
taste
is
average
as
well
it
is
basically
just
a
pale
brew
with
no
malt
character
that
is
slighty
bitter
and
dry
on
the
finish
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
above
average
carbonation
this
beer
drinks
about
average
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
its
one
and
done
for
me
drinkable
a
solid
brew
but
not
outstanding
pours
with
a
twofingered
white
head
that
fades
slowly
and
leaves
a
good
lace
medium
carbonation
light
golden
amber
color
light
bodied
not
your
usual
belgian
nose
is
malty
start
sweet
and
crisp
finishes
on
the
sweet
side
but
there
are
some
soapy
overtones
anecdote
the
other
night
i
invited
some
folks
over
and
treated
them
to
a
750ml
bottle
of
kasteel
and
they
were
duly
blown
away
later
one
of
them
saw
a
can
of
this
in
my
fridge
and
asked
to
try
it
this
is
way
better
than
that
other
one
he
practically
screamed
this
is
for
him
and
his
kind
all
the
world
over
lord
bless
em
very
average
nothing
distinctive
and
too
close
to
water
not
a
beer
that
will
knock
your
socks
off
but
a
bit
better
than
some
of
the
other
reviews
would
indicate
maybe
its
better
out
of
the
bottle
a
solid
european
light
lager
had
this
at
a
good
beer
that
comes
in
a
can
tasting
after
work
pale
pilsner
color
white
head
faint
hops
and
citrus
aroma
tasted
very
clean
with
an
oily
hop
flavor
no
skunk
or
funk
as
compared
to
heineken
and
pilsner
urquell
drinkable
middleoftheroad
beer
pretty
good
id
say
maybe
some
others
had
a
bad
batch
i
think
this
beer
may
get
slammed
a
bit
for
being
in
a
can
and
thats
what
i
find
especially
appealing
a
decent
not
great
beer
in
a
can
a
beer
i
can
take
on
our
local
beach
or
condo
pool
no
glass
allowed
it
pours
a
strawgold
color
and
holds
a
substantial
frothy
white
head
and
lots
of
clingy
lace
the
aroma
leaves
a
little
to
be
desired
with
a
raw
malty
hop
and
odd
damp
basement
smell
a
modest
sweetish
malt
almost
oily
body
blends
well
with
the
spicy
and
slightly
metallic
hops
a
faint
citrus
taste
comes
and
goes
a
light
alcohol
fuminess
is
noticeable
throughout
better
than
heineken
thanks
to
nerofiddled
for
the
sample
i
found
this
to
be
a
rather
odd
beer
in
some
ways
a
sterotypical
eurolager
very
sweet
and
bready
with
a
hint
of
grassy
flavors
mouthfeel
was
extremely
soft
as
though
they
had
been
overtinkering
with
the
water
ph
sweetness
and
bread
flavors
went
beyond
the
eurolager
norm
however
and
clear
belgian
influences
were
present
it
bordered
on
a
belgian
white
ale
without
the
spices
slightly
hazy
yellowish
gold
with
a
firm
brightwhite
head
that
holds
very
well
and
leaves
excellent
lace
the
aroma
offers
a
full
grainy
maltiness
and
an
herbal
hoppiness
the
body
is
lightmedium
and
it
has
a
very
fine
restrained
carbonation
very
smooth
creamy
in
the
mouth
the
flavor
has
surprisingly
a
light
touch
of
belgian
mustiness
which
is
not
normally
found
in
their
pilseners
the
malt
is
well
balanced
with
bitterness
theres
some
lightly
woody
herbal
hop
flavor
the
hops
are
confusing
or
is
that
interesting
to
me
i
cant
identify
any
variety
or
even
a
general
characteristic
other
than
the
dried
leaves
note
it
has
and
maybe
a
little
bit
of
light
dried
pine
i
wonder
if
theyre
using
aged
hops
and
yet
that
doesnt
seem
the
case
either
odd
the
finish
is
semisweet
semidry
with
some
nice
bitterness
but
also
a
sticky
maltiness
although
theres
also
a
gently
lingering
earthy
mineral
quality
that
helps
to
dry
it
out
this
one
is
a
quagmire
its
not
a
very
good
example
of
a
pilsener
at
all
and
it
doesnt
have
any
stand
out
qualities
but
it
is
interesting
memorable
if
it
was
a
touch
drier
it
might
be
better
but
then
it
would
be
like
every
other
mediocre
belgian
pilsener
i
have
to
give
it
some
credit
for
its
uniqueness
although
thats
not
reflected
in
the
score
i
certainly
wouldnt
buy
a
case
of
this
but
i
found
it
interesting
enough
to
suggest
trying
one
to
see
what
its
like
notes
a
decent
euro
lager
at
best
stella
artois
is
a
half
notch
better
but
id
rather
have
a
bavik
for
the
sake
of
smaller
breweries
though
at
5
99
a
six
pack
of
11
2
oz
cans
it
is
a
bit
pricey
for
what
you
get
solid
beer
one
of
the
better
commercial
lagers
slightly
sweet
with
a
big
herbal
hop
presence
and
a
moderately
bitter
finish
its
a
tad
malty
sweet
but
fairly
clean
and
refreshing
the
taste
of
this
beer
reminds
me
of
the
smell
of
weed
ive
had
this
beer
before
and
will
buy
it
again
easy
drinking
packs
a
nice
buzz
sports
suds
pours
a
clear
golden
colour
with
a
thin
bubbly
head
the
nose
has
some
sweet
malt
breadiness
with
only
a
hint
of
hoppiness
the
taste
brings
much
of
the
same
with
a
bit
of
yeast
and
grass
it
almost
finishes
as
soon
as
it
hit
your
tongue
with
a
crisp
dryness
honestly
doesnt
taste
like
much
an
okay
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
so
overall
would
i
recommend
it
sure
if
you
find
it
on
special
this
is
a
nice
beer
i
did
more
enjoy
that
beer
than
the
heineken
overall
unassumingly
complex
for
a
lager
great
balance
easy
drinking
beer
goes
down
smooth
a
classic
european
beer
not
as
bitter
as
belgian
and
dutch
beers
nice
taste
i
like
it
one
of
the
worse
beers
i
have
tried
slightly
minty
not
a
typical
pilsner
translucent
pale
yellow
nice
foamy
head
smell
reminds
me
of
empty
beer
bottles
in
need
of
recycling
taste
is
light
with
a
nice
amount
of
carbonation
has
a
bitter
finish
that
lingers
a
bit
too
long
while
i
like
this
style
of
beer
this
one
seems
a
bit
lacking
compared
to
others
not
horrible
but
just
ok
i
love
carlsberg
biases
stated
green
bottle
euro
roots
not
much
else
to
say
its
a
decent
beer
but
it
doesnt
do
much
to
set
itself
apart
from
other
beers
in
this
style
overall
an
ok
beer
i
am
sure
this
beer
has
suffered
in
the
us
market
when
craft
beer
took
off
carlsberg
looks
like
a
relatively
decent
lager
and
if
you
temporarily
disable
your
taste
buds
it
might
even
fool
you
that
it
is
a
good
lager
as
it
is
incredibly
smooth
however
as
i
was
unable
to
do
so
i
was
overcome
by
the
incredibly
metallic
aftertaste
which
completely
ruined
any
sense
of
flavor
for
me
smooth
easy
drinking
clean
lager
a
nice
smooth
beer
can
be
drunk
everywhere
everytime
its
good
to
drink
during
a
football
game
just
a
standard
german
pilsner
smoother
going
down
than
a
heineken
and
thats
all
you
need
to
know
about
this
one
this
may
be
the
least
favorite
beer
ive
ever
had
the
only
thing
i
get
out
of
this
one
is
skunk
not
bad
had
a
lot
better
good
danish
beer
best
german
pilsner
i
have
tasted
yet
a
mass
produced
beer
that
meets
low
expectations
not
great
but
not
horrendous
an
average
pils
alcoholy
taste
best
in
summer
to
drink
ice
cold
i
may
be
biased
here
but
i
absolutely
love
carlsberg
my
sample
is
a
bit
skunked
but
its
not
creating
a
unenjoyable
drinking
experience
if
anything
its
making
the
beer
finish
on
the
sour
side
i
personally
find
that
interesting
out
of
all
the
pale
type
lagers
ive
ever
had
this
one
is
my
absolute
favorite
id
buy
this
over
bud
miller
coors
pbr
corona
or
even
heineken
i
dont
know
if
we
in
american
can
get
the
cans
but
id
say
buy
cans
for
a
more
pure
taste
i
love
this
stuff
well
balanced
and
easy
beer
thats
goes
down
smoothly
a
bit
boring
perhaps
refreshing
with
a
bitter
hops
flavor
and
slight
malty
aftertaste
while
not
very
memorable
makes
for
a
nice
casual
session
beer
super
strong
pilsner
reminds
me
of
heineken
on
steroids
i
actually
kinda
like
it
it
does
have
a
bit
of
a
bitter
taste
it
stays
dank
and
drinkable
enough
to
be
enjoyable
with
so
many
good
beers
out
there
not
likely
i
would
seek
it
out
again
in
fact
it
was
a
gift
still
pretty
good
for
as
much
heat
it
gets
for
me
a
little
better
than
heineken
pilsners
are
one
of
my
favorite
styles
and
i
enjoyed
this
lightish
yellow
little
head
good
lacing
smell
is
hops
yeast
medium
carbonation
a
little
bitterness
clean
very
good
beer
overall
this
beer
is
very
popular
in
the
uk
and
it
is
easy
to
see
why
it
is
straight
forward
and
does
not
do
anything
particularly
wrong
it
may
not
be
very
interesting
but
it
is
a
damned
sight
better
than
most
of
the
pilsners
ive
had
from
outside
germany
euro
beers
mundane
struggle
pretty
average
here
in
ireland
many
of
the
euros
are
far
less
than
that
flavor
mild
combination
of
sweet
malt
and
those
grassy
earthy
hops
taste
a
bit
like
a
groslch
that
has
been
slightly
watered
down
overall
good
brew
i
would
have
this
one
again
got
a
pint
glass
to
take
home
with
it
too
overall
this
is
what
it
is
a
widespread
cheap
yet
fairly
delicious
pilsener
style
beer
o
overall
this
beer
has
a
good
amount
of
bitterness
with
some
malt
taste
it
would
of
tasted
better
if
there
was
a
little
more
sweetness
to
it
its
an
ok
beer
this
beer
is
easy
drinking
and
lacks
any
strong
adjuncty
flavors
and
is
a
pretty
good
session
brew
but
nothing
very
distinguished
i
think
i
paid
around
8
bucks
for
a
four
pack
of
pintplus
cans
which
isnt
too
bad
of
a
deal
this
beer
is
only
available
in
one
store
in
my
town
that
i
know
of
hennesey
grocery
had
a
bottle
at
a
calgary
pub
in
the
kensington
area
with
dinner
poured
into
a
pub
glass
looks
darker
than
many
other
euro
lagers
a
yellow
to
just
shy
of
amber
hue
with
a
smattering
of
white
bubbles
smells
like
grainy
pale
malt
grassy
and
slightly
spicy
hops
skunk
and
a
decent
whiff
of
sulphur
palate
features
a
light
cracker
malt
backbone
some
dms
green
grassy
hops
subdued
lemon
and
lime
rind
white
grape
notes
and
a
noticeable
but
reduced
residual
sweetness
compared
to
many
of
its
euro
pale
lager
cousins
perhaps
this
is
what
earns
it
a
bonafide
pils
designation
very
fizzy
and
lightbodied
as
one
would
expect
yet
reasonably
creamy
and
smooth
not
too
bad
all
things
considered
the
usual
flaws
found
in
greenbottled
mass
market
imports
are
reduced
or
absent
considerably
better
than
heineken
to
name
but
one
example
even
if
it
remains
pretty
mainstream
in
overall
feel
light
drinkable
refreshing
this
is
the
definition
of
an
okay
beer
with
little
real
complexity
but
an
easiness
that
allows
you
to
drink
a
lot
of
them
o
as
with
many
beers
of
the
style
and
similar
styles
there
isnt
a
ton
going
on
still
though
a
very
tasty
and
crisp
lager
no
cheap
filler
taste
or
piss
smelltaste
tasty
and
extremely
drinkable
pilsener
will
drink
again
o
decent
beer
i
had
it
many
times
in
england
but
it
actually
holds
up
pretty
well
in
comparison
over
here
overall
i
prefer
the
more
sweeter
balanced
tasting
euro
lagers
if
this
is
the
traditional
way
to
have
one
i
may
skip
mass
produced
pilsners
all
together
going
through
some
international
breweries
that
are
readily
available
so
here
i
come
easy
denmark
this
stuff
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
relatively
shortlived
offwhite
foam
the
nose
comprises
mild
funky
wheat
light
skunk
dry
wheat
and
vague
grasses
the
taste
brings
in
more
of
the
same
with
the
skunk
thankfully
replaced
by
hard
water
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
light
moderate
carbonation
and
a
watery
feel
overall
this
doesnt
taste
too
far
off
from
every
other
massproduced
euro
lager
out
there
though
the
grassiness
does
help
it
a
bit
in
my
eyes
that
said
im
not
likely
to
have
too
many
more
of
these
in
the
future
overall
a
cheap
euro
beer
and
not
a
very
good
one
too
much
apple
and
just
a
bit
lifeless
better
options
out
there
in
this
style
o
it
has
more
character
than
your
average
european
macro
lager
but
it
still
doesnt
do
much
to
stay
memorable
i
still
prefer
this
to
certain
other
green
bottle
imports
mouthfeel
light
body
high
carbonation
makes
for
a
very
dry
crispy
finish
overall
not
a
flavor
powerhouse
by
any
means
but
it
is
rather
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
brew
o
i
prefer
carlsberg
over
both
heineken
and
budweiser
it
has
a
little
more
flavour
going
for
it
and
i
used
to
drink
this
quite
a
bit
before
getting
into
more
exotic
beers
best
choice
for
me
between
the
common
tap
beers
over
here
overall
definitely
a
little
better
than
the
other
euro
pale
lagers
pretty
good
readily
accessible
and
easily
accessible
the
smell
of
the
beer
is
extremely
malty
and
theres
only
a
hint
of
bitterness
in
the
aroma
overall
it
is
a
very
straightforward
smell
the
head
of
the
beer
tastes
very
metallic
the
taste
is
more
metallic
than
most
canned
beers
but
it
also
offers
a
really
nice
hoppy
taste
its
very
standard
for
a
pilsner
but
there
arent
too
many
flaws
either
honestly
the
bottled
version
is
far
superior
to
the
canned
one
since
it
doesnt
have
the
metallic
taste
ill
say
this
is
the
first
time
a
canned
beer
for
me
has
had
this
noticeable
of
a
metallic
taste
to
it
perhaps
ill
review
the
bottled
version
another
day
or
even
better
on
tap
but
its
just
average
oh
well
im
totally
drinking
it
again
for
nostalgias
sake
this
beer
is
probably
suffering
from
over
production
it
is
a
nice
pilsner
with
a
long
history
of
production
it
is
a
quality
european
pilsner
that
is
very
drinkable
and
quite
nice
after
a
long
hot
day
be
careful
as
you
can
drink
too
many
and
the
after
effects
are
quite
nasty
it
seems
this
beer
will
give
you
a
nasty
hangover
o
an
easy
drinking
beer
nothing
special
but
still
decent
i
had
this
on
tap
at
whiskey
priest
theres
nothing
intriguing
about
a
supermass
produced
german
pilsner
named
carlsberg

resulting
in
a
massive
amount
of
dense
but
without
the
kind
of
forced
carbonation
that
seems
to
want

scrub

the
taste
was
mild

5ive
been
studying
in
london
and
have
been
encountering
lots
of
beer
i
wouldnt
normally
find
in
the
states
this
beer
is
an
average
pale
lager
and
is
my
go
to
when
i
cant
get
stella
or
becks
this
is
still
easier
to
drink
than
the
big
three
light
beers
at
home
in
my
opinion
but
again
is
nothing
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
for
easy
to
start
of
a
night
with
a
few
of
these

so
i

it
just
smells

beer

this

this
beer
while
visiting
norway
this
beer
was
a
nice
example
of
a
pilsner
light
in
color
and
very
clear
considerable
lacing
on
the
glass
that
persisted
to
the
end
i
was
impressed
with
the
clean
taste
and
nonexistent
aftertaste
very
nice

but
it
isnt
one
that
ill
purchase
again
i
cant
help
but
think
that
with
a
tweak
or
three
but
just
a
really
old
cardboardy
hops
lightly
bitter
in
the
finish
with
a
light
fruity
sweetness
not
terrible
deep
bready
malt
underneath
sweet
grains
to
catch
you
off
guard
and
pounce
on
you
once
again
and
it
lingers
i
had
this
rated
a
bit
higher
for
taste
until
the
aftertaste
hit
me
and
yet
through
all
of
that
torment
with
the
flavour
as
carlsberg
makes
more
than
enough
other
beers
alone
not
much

little
about
this
beer
distinguishes
iteither
for
better
or
worsefrom
many
other
european
lagers
the
taste
is
slightly
grainy
but
not
offensively
so
hops
are
just
detectable
with
the
light
flavor
and
crispness
and
it
is
very
smooth
it
has
a
strange
buttery
kind
of
flavor
to
it
lots
of
sweet
malts
and
bready
grains
make
up
the
flavor
it
is
really
nothing
special
soapy
in
texture
with
finesmall
bubbles
the
body
was
carbonated
and
clear
the
hue
was
gold
and
the
nose
was
fruity
the
lacing
was
only
fair
with
this
beer
the
flavor
was
bitter
with
an
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
some
sense
of
cream
corn
smells
as
well
a
pretty
dry
lager

tried
this

before
and
wasnt

they
would
take
extra
measures
to
produce
a
beer
of
equal
merit
and
there
was
a
certain
peppery
spiciness
in
there
that
surprised
me
other
than
that
very
clean
and
has
some
malt
and
sweet
spice
but
is
all
very

is
more
of
the

with
a

i
never
knew
how
good
this
one
was

tried
it
at

of

haunts
citrus
hops
come
into

these
then
fade
and
the

return
this
version
of

is
not

as
the
local
version
that
i
enjoyed
in

ive

spactacular
overall
meh
pilsners
arent
really
my
style
and
by
the
standards
of
other
german
beers
this
one
really
doesnt
have
much
going
for
it
still
a
cut
above
the
usual
macro
suspects
but
still
nothing
special
a
mediocre
pilsener
i
tried
in
germany
enjoy
easy
drinking
nothing
interesting
about
this
beer
inoffensive
i
found
this
one
to
be
quite
a
poor
beer
when
i
tried
it
again
here
it
was
actually
terrible
in
places
with
far
too
much
bitterness
coming
through
and
a
really
dry
feel
that
didnt
help
matters
at
all
the
body
was
a
thin
one
but
this
wasnt
anything
too
serious
it
was
the
taste
that
was
the
real
problem
here
with
very
little
to
it
at
all
i
dont
think
this
one
will
be
a
beer
i
go
for
again
the
quintessential
refreshing
hoppy
northern
german
pilsener
one
of
the
best
beers
in
the
world
can
poured
a
bright
yellow
color
lager
with
a
large
pure
white
color
head
with
good
retention
and
some
lacing
aroma
of
light
cereal
notes
is
not
really
noteworthy
taste
is
also
dominated
by
light
cereal
notes
with
some
residual
sugar
notes
with
light
dry
hoppy
notes
body
is
light
with
good
carbonation
ok
pilsner
bit
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
a
good
solid
dry
pilsner
thats
tasty
thirst
quenching
and
just
damn
good
recommended
i
was
at
hopleaf
in
chicago
and
asked
for
a
good
pilsner
this
was
what
i
got
and
couldnt
have
been
happier
solid
and
not
overdone
for
the
sake
of
just
overdoing
it
like

o
a

pilsener
i
dont
usually

but
i
enjoyed
this
final
grade

57
a
b
grade
jever
pilsener
is
refreshing
inoffensive
and
highly
sessionable
in
essence
a
prototypical
german
pils
an
otherwise
unremarkable
beer
but
like
most
german
pilseners
imported
into
this
province
its
still
pretty
good
value
for
the
price
point
that
reason
alone
means
i
will
probably
return
to
it
in
the
future
a
middleoftheroad
lager
that
shouldnt
ruffle
too
many
feathers
this
was
one
was
just
ok
had
some
good
elements
up

the
hop
flavors
but
finished
weak
with
clearly
old

flavors
and
some

of

easy

a

still
and

all

unfortunately
the
conclusion
is
to
go
ahead
with
it
even
despite
the
wellknown
fact
that
green
glass
can
have
awful
consequences
for
delicate
lightbodied
lagers
sadly
enough
theres
a
good
percentage
of
the
population
who
having
only
tried
industrial
import
actually
perceive
this
skunkiness
as
a
sign
of
quality
its
not
and
jever
should
know
better
always
been
a
better
pilsner
than
most
especially
if
you
prefer
a
dry
taste
compared
to
some
of
the
slightly
sweeter
ones
mouthfeel
is
crisp
and
dry
overall
i
like
it
im
going
to
have
to
follow
through
on
this
halfassed
plan
to
try
more
pilsners
and
see
what
theyre
all
about
taste
is
great
i
love
ti
its
coarse
its
established
its
bot
some
herbal
and
some
grass
and
only
a
light
touch
of
grain
sweetness
on
a
truly
light
and
crisp
body
this
is
clean
flows
like
water
and
it
should
its
a
pils
it
goes
in
a
big
pitcher
on
the
table
to
fill
you
glass
again
and
again
its
not
heavy
its
a
bit
leafy
a
bit
coarse
a
bit
earthy
and
it
is
semi
astringent
in
the
dry
finish
i
love
this
beer
because
it
drinks
like
it
should
easily
with
plenty
to
engage
the
palate
and
no
thing
heavy
or
out
of
place
leafy
crisp
prost
jever
is
not
and
if
you
like
prima
pils
from
victory
you
will
like
jevers
pils
beacause
it
has
a
similar
taste
straw

slight
lacing
on
the

mild

with

crisp

mediumdry

and
light

did
not
pack
the
bitterness
or
flavor
that
i
crave
from
a
good
pilsner
nothing
wrong
with
the
beer
there
are
just
way
better
versions
of
the
style
out
there
edit
had
this
on
tap
recently
and
i
recommend
to
try
it
too
if
you
find
it
very
sessionable
and
refreshing
beer
a
bit
too
light
but
with
clear
hops
notes
that
gives
a
nice
dryness
and
bitterness
o
bad
the
malt
tastes
stale
the
finish
of
this
beer
is
not
pleasant
and
it
only
makes
me
want
to
chug
this
down
in
a
flash
to
never
deal
with
the
bitterness
maybe
thats
why
they
chug
it
down
in
the
nightclubs
all
over
germany
i
couldnt
finish
this
beer
im
guessing
this
is
actually
a
pretty
decent
german
pils
on
tap
or
closer
to
the
source
the
bb
date
is
early
next
year
so
well
im
not
one
to
point
fingers
hah
but
this
record
is
getting
pretty
old
and
dated
this
is
just
all
right
in
its
present
incarnation
something
to
drink
when
the
lawnmowins
all
done
and
the
thinkins
not
yet
begun
pour
is
pale
straw
yellow
with
white
head
nose
has
strong
malt
aroma
doughy
and
some
light
bread
crust
caramel
and
grassy
hop
behind
taste
is
more
doughy
caramel
maybe
diacetyl
faint
grassy
hop
light
body
and
soft
carbonation
very
creamy
on
the
palate
golden
yellow
body
with
a
thin
lace
on
the
glass
that
lingers
but
no
head
to
speak
of
smells
like
a
german
pilsner
grassy
and
clean
lots
of
hops
and
spices
theres
a
bitter
smell
that
almost
leaves
a
sense
of
coffee
smells
pretty
good
taste
is
that
of
a
normal
pilsner
which
i
like
but
theres
not
much
to
write
home
about
heavy
on
the
hops
bitterness
that
sits
on
your
tongue
for
a
good
while
a
very
fresh
and
clean
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
clean
and
crisp
but
overly
carbonated
in
my
opinion
none
the
less
it
goes
down
nicely
and
would
make
a
fine
session
pilsner
worth
a
go
did
not
score
a
t
s
m
at
that
time
disregard
those
scores
o
hmm
in
some
ways
this
is
a
typical
lager
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
dry
and
bitter
flavors
that
give
it
some
character
worthy
of
try
but
nothing
i
would
grab
again
o
would
drink
again
prefer
this
to
the
pilseners
ive
tried
at
my
local
pub
so
far
medium
body
well
carbonated
dry
and
crisp
on
the
tongue
this
drinks
fine
but
theres
definitely
more
expressive
interesting
pilseners
readily
available
bitterness
that
is
this
beers
reputation
is
certainly
there
straight
ibus
over
any
noble
spice
hallertau
and
tettnang
here
which
is
unusual
in
germany
surprised
by
how
soft
it
is
though
and
with
some
residual
sweetness
its
just
missing
a
certain
snap
a
top
pils
but
not
the
original
version
of
prima
pils
which
is
what
i
was
hoping
for
o
easy
drinking
beer
good
session
german
lager
beer
recommended
revised
following
bottle
sampled
in
august
2013
o
overall
an
average
pilsener
not
much
going
on
in
the
nose
or
taste
though
neither
are
bad
probably
wouldnt
seek
it
out
again
o
was
hoping
for
more
but
for
me
this
is
just
and
average
pilsener
odbetter
than
most
pils
its
like
a
poor
mans
prima
pils
i
enjoyed
it
but
i
dont
love
it
worth
a
try
however
o
overall
this
is
a
good
pils
not
a
great
one
eku
has
a
great
one
and
trumers
us
brewed
rendition
is
great
to
style
the
trumer
may
prove
a
divide
between
imported
and
domesticbrewed
beers
showing
that
a
pasteurized
import
may
just
lose
some
of
the
smoother
characters
youd
get
at
the
source
nonetheless
the
jever
also
proves
that
light
lagers
dont
have
to
be
bland
and
characterless
o
a
good
pilsner
easy
drinking
and
flavorful
perfect
summer
pilsner
i
wonder
what
it
taste
like
straight
from
the
brewery
hmm
oa
decent
refreshing
pils
refreshing
and
drinkable
pils
probably
wont
get
it
again
but
it
was
certainly
worth
trying
d
had
a
few
complaints
as
i
stated
above
but
overall
a
highly
refreshing
pils
overall
was
crisp
and
clean
and
went
well
with
lemon
custard
jever
is
a
serious
pilsner
for
those
who
enjoy
crisp
and
well
hopped
pilsners
this
is
super
dry
and
very
hoppy
its
just
awesome
a
great
session
beer
with
plenty
of
carbonation
and
hoppy
zip
i
think
this
was
prima
pils
inspiration
a
must
try
da
very
enjoyable
beer
easy
to
drink
sessionable
brew
overall
a
quite
nice
beer
oi
like
a
pilsner
with
some
hop
bite
and
jever
delivers
very
drinkable
at
4
9
abv
overall
a
nicely
done
pils
very
clean
and
a
joy
to
knock
down
after
work
jever
pilsener
is
a
crystal
clear
pale
golden
lager
with
a
soft
fluffy
white
head
that
has
outstanding
retention
it
has
a
pilsner
malt
aroma
it
smells
light
fruity
and
grainy
in
the
mouth
its
light
bodied
and
smooth
the
finish
is
clean
and
dry
it
has
a
light
clean
pilsner
malt
flavor
it
has
a
decent
bitterness
at
the
finish
to
zip
up
the
taste
and
keep
me
thirsty
for
more
it
tastes
a
little
doughy
and
a
little
fruity
the
bitterness
is
a
little
wooden
and
peppery
with
maybe
a
hint
of
juniper
im
not
much
of
a
pilsner
guy
but
i
found
this
to
be
quite
pleasing
and
very
refreshing
its
also
nice
to
drink
something
from
a
green
bottle
thats
not
skunky
i
would
drink
this
on
purpose
in
the
summer
would
recommend
jever
if
a
pilsner
fan
overall
not
a
real
good
pils
imo
too
much
skunk
covering
up
and
real
aromas
and
flavors
considering
this
was
on
draft
im
surprised
at
said
skunkiness
finalfairly
easy
drinking
though
much
sweeter
than
i
expected
though
very
good
the
sweetness
makes
it
not
quite
as
crisp
as
im
used
to
for
the
style
and
a
little
bit
heavy
the
alcohol
is
actually
slightly
noticeable
but
it
is
good
overall
its
just
a
little
bit
unbalanced
imo
though
not
too
distracting
o
reasonably
satisfying
pilsener
nothing
exceptional
here
though

for

and
more
d
i
dont
think
this
is
anything

special
but
at

the
flavors
are
very
clean
green
bottle
medium
to
lighter
yellow
has
a
nice
noble
hop
aroma
grassy
and
slightly

taste
is
the

starting

and
finishing
a

heavier
with
the
pronounced

a

ok
not

more
bitter
than
many
german
pils
but
as
skunky
as
heineken
go
with
the
draft
or
minikeg
version
jever
is
not
a
beginners
pilsner
if
bitterness
is
your
quest
then
jever
should
fullfill
that
while
sometimes
a
little
too
much
i
did
enjoy
the
bitterness
in
general
o
a
classic
pilsener
i
expected
something
crisp
and
delicious
but
the
dryness
and
all
the
grainy
flavours
made
it
a
bit
harsh
the
price
is
good
though
its
still
a
pretty
tasty
lager
and
i
think
it
would
do
well
with
tasty
home
cooking
o
very
nice
pils
they
seem
to
use
very
good
ingredients
and
water
along
with
a
quality
brewing

o
this
is
an

to
a
thin

with

kick
on
the
finish
there
is
an
astringent
bitterness
on
the
palate
that
lingers
after
each
sip
this
beer
has
a
good
level
of
carbonation
with
a
very
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
overall
this
is
a
good
pilsner
with
a
very
refreshing
and
authentic
taste
the
taste
is
crisp
subtle
malt
character
with
a
heavy
hand
of
hops
quite
tasty
thoughout
and
finishes
dry
there
is
a
nice
amount
of
spice
but
something
just
seems
a
bit
muddied
or
rough
there
really
isnt
anything
wrong
that
i
can
point
out
as
much
as
this
isnt
a
great
german
pils
still
a
nice
pilsener
overall
a
good
hot
summer
beer
thanks
to
the
dry
finish
not
something
id
particularly
crave
or
seek
out
again
perhaps
this
tastes
better
closer
to
the
source
poured
into
a
pilsner

a

foamy
white
2
and
half
head
lots
of
carbonation
smells
that
kinda
skunklike
smell
found
a
lot
in
import
pilsners
at
first
that
goes
away
my
wife
smelled
it
across
the
room
and
said
that
taste
reminded
me
of
stella
dry
weak
bitter
taste
and
mouthfeel
i
like
this
german
pilsner
great
for
hot
summer
months
overall
very
dry
and
hoppy
for
the
style
different
but
nice
o
i
would
really
like
to
try
this
beer
again
on
tap
or
from
a
can
to
experience
it
flaw
free
regardless
its
still
pretty
easy
drinking
and
worth
trying
if
you
like
pilsners
pours
a
very
light
clear
yellow
color
fizzy
white
head
that
dissipates
after
a
minute
or
two
herbal
grassy
very
assertive
saaz
hop
aroma
as
others
have
said
it
has
a
very
typical
generic
pilsner
aroma
nice
and
clean
with
a
very
hop
forward
flavor
but
a
bit
one
note
not
the
best
german
pils
out
there
but
a
nice
reminder
to
branch
out
and
try
some
other
ones
overall
its
an
ok
lager
not
like
the
other
german
ones
around
but
more
like
heinekin
or
something
d
very
nice
pilsener
fits
the
style
to
a
tee
pils
from
the
homeland
good
pilsner
but
certainly
not
one
id
choose
over
others
like
herren
augustiner
or
the
rathaus
beers
overall
a
very
boring
pils
it
lacks
flavor
and
body
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
nice
fluffy
white
foamy
head
with
a
clear
light
strawgold
color
the
carbonation
is
high
as
is
expected
the
aroma
of
spicy
grassy
hops
is
all
over
this
one
there
is
bit
of
cereal
grains
that
give
off
some
good
notes
as
well
the
taste
follows
the
nose
nice
spicy
bitterness
throughout
the
entire
brew
and
the
grains
show
through
as
well
the
brew
is
mild
and
is
ideal
for
a
hot
summerspring
day
a
great
german
pilsner
overall
though
no
one
area
was
exceptional
and
most
were
merely
average
i
really
enjoyed
drinking
the
jever
it
is
plenty
tasty
and
quite
satisfying
i
would
certainly
buy
this
one
again
4
of
5
just
cant
get
into
these
pilsners
the
look
of
the
beer
isnt
too
bad
it
looks
like
a
a
yellow
bodied
beer
with
a
foamy
white
head
that
has
light
carbonation
bubbles
rising
from
the
glass
the
smell
to
me
is
not
pleasent
makes
me
feel
like
its
gone
bad
or
something
the
taste
is
grassy
very
much
like
fresh
cut
grass
some
earth
and
leafs
may
be
in
there
too
the
mouthfeel
was
light
and
easy
to
drink
thankfully
i
dont
ever
need
to
have
this
one
again
this
one
pours
into
the
glass
a
nice
golden
hay
color
with
a
huge
head
of
nearly
three
inches
that
never
seems
to
let
itself
go
down
coating
the
sides
with
some
nice
lacing
and
tons
of
carbonation
aroma
is
light
grains
bready
notes
hints
of
light
clove
maybe
and
a
touch
of
some
earthy
grass
notes
nothing
crazy
but
it
does
the
job
very
light
and
clean
flavor
crisp
refreshing
nothing
out
the
ordinary
in
any
way
was
easy
to
throw
down
with
a
clean
and
refreshing
aftertaste
overall
not
bad
at
all
could
easily
but
down
two
or
three
everything
else
about
this
brew
is
well
balanced
it
might
be
a
little
weak
on
bubbles
flattening
out
easily
a
very
mild
taste
light
easy
drinking
but
aromatic
out
the
wazoo
its
a
good
buy
for
that
i
want
to
buy
it
to
drink
one
warm
overall
a
great
pils
get
it
and
if
you
dont
enjoy
it
consider
that
your
palate
might
need
some
training
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
its
not
as
heavily
carbonated
or
as
drying
as
the
style
can
sometimes
be
and
the
drinkability
is
quite
good
a
solid
pilsner
that
doesnt
stand
out
as
anything
special
but
still
an
enjoyable
beer
o
not
a
bad
beer
but
not
as
substantial
as
konig
d
this
is
the
type
beer
they
all
want
to
be
who
bmc
thats
who
but
theyll
never
come
close
to
this
overall
excellent
example
of
the
style
and
a
great
beer
overall
very
refreshing
i
see
myself
drinking
lots
more
of
this
in
the
future
dr
a
bit
shite
for
berlin
prices
overall
im
a
big
fan
of
pilseners
and
although
ive
been
somewhat
critical
in
my
review
its
still
a
good
beer
and
worthy
of
a
sampling
or
revisit
of
the
premium
pilseners
ive
sampled
its
probably
in
my
top
10
somewhere
but
not
top
2
or
3
drinkability
this
isnt
traditional
but
was
very
tasty
more
like
a
czech
pils
than
a
german
one
poured
it
high
into
a
pint
glass
finding
a
good
sturdy
head
that
dissipated
quickly
leaving
a
thin
ring
of
foam
at
top
beautiful
straw
blond
color
delicious
yeasty
hoppy
malty
aroma
the
hallertau
hops
in
there
sing
a
gorgeous
bitter
floral
chorus
again
i
usually
prefer
a
bouquet
of
different
hops
but
this
one
variety
can
stand
up
for
a
gorgeous
solo
so
rich
youd
think
it
was
a
chorus
taste
is
crisp
transparent
the
malt
and
yeast
so
perfectly
balanced
with
the
hops
that
you
have
to
imagine
theres
something
really
special
about
even
just
the
water
in
this
beverage
mouthfeel
is
bracing
a
bite
just
sharp
enough
makes
you
want
a
liverwurst
onion
sandwich
on
pumpernickel
with
hot
mustard
and
horseradish
do
both
if
you
can
the
aftertaste
lets
the
hops
hang
on
so
delicately
and
yet
with
bitter
authority
that
you
have
to
wish
these
little
bottles
were
twice
as
big
such
a
good
beer
this
i
found
it
disappeared
faster
than
the
usual
brew
leaving
no
lacing
on
glass
a
lack
id
usually
deplore
if
it
hadnt
tasted
so
good
so
easy
to
swallow
i
find
local
beers
much
more
politically
correct
but
again
i
have
to
make
an
exception
for
this
stupid
little
glass
container
hauled
all
the
way
here
to
upstate
ny
from
germany
its
worth
it
well
its
worth
getting
your
friend
to
give
it
to
you
anyway
my
drinkability
index
usually
depends
on
whether
i
can
afford
to
drink
it
after
all
if
im
not
able
to
purchase
the
stuff
im
not
able
to
drink
much
either
as
i
dont
know
what
a
6pack
costs
id
say
id
gladly
pay
up
to
9
for
6
tiny
bottles
of
a
beer
this
good
wouldnt
buy
it
in
a
bottle
again
though
its
pedestrian
at
best
there
might
as
well
get
a
bitburg
d
the
beer
is
quite
easy
to
drink
and
really
opens
up
your
palate
the
palate
opens
quite
significantly
hoppy
lemony
zesty
resiny
and
coating
my
palate
with
its
wondrousness
sharp
herbal
and
intense
its
almost
minerallike
in
some
ways
all
of
this
nearly
whelms
the
malt
backbone
which
is
pretty
light
but
still
complex
and
different
enough
to
appear
behind
the
hops
crackerlike
and
mildly
biscuity
the
intensity
and
character
of
the
hops
make
me
think
of
a
dry
sharp
cheddar
in
some
ways
drying
and
crisp
on
the
finish
with
a
resiny
hops
theres
lemon
zest
and
herbal
character
present
highly
carbonated
this
is
an
effortless
drinker
i
will
have
to
seek
this
out
on
tap
had
this
on
tap
last
night
at
the
best
german
bar
in
philly
brauhaus
schmitz
had
a
liter
served
in
a
giant
sized
glass
mug
a
very
nice
clean
drinking
german
pils
so
good
that
my
wife
made
me
switch
beers
and
she
finished
the
liter
for
me
i
was
left
drinking
hofbrau
dunkel
would
consider
having
this
again
d
im
surprised
to
see
the
ratings
for
this
beer
easily
one
of
the
best
pilsners
ive
ever
had
this
is
a
typical
german
pilsener
complete
with
the
typical
look
smell
taste
this
is
not
the
best
beer
of
this
type
i
have
had
but
it
does
well
all
5

this
is
beer
that

overall
a

this

be
my
new
favorite
german
pilsner
how
did
i
ever
forget
about
jever
dry
nononsense
beer
here
rather
drinkable
with
a
little
more
hop
presence
than
a
lot
of
less
characterfull
pilseners
if
it
was
a
little
cheaper
id
drink
a
lot
of
this
as
it
is
im
happy
to
find
that
my
memories
of
this
beer
were
not
too
terribly
diminished
by
the
taste
of
reality
well
done
but
boring
like
a
burger
with
no
fixins
pours
a
clean
yellow
color
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
small
dryness
to
nothing
at
all
in
the
taste
small
dry
light
malt
and
really
nothing
at
all
a
smooth
light
and
water
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dry
malt
in
the
aftertaste
watery
lack
of
taste
and
smell
notes
of
fresh
grass
hay
lemon
zest
and
green
pepper
there
is
nothing
malty
about
it
its
all
about
freshness
green
grass
and
dry
finish
overall
the
glass
is
empty
before
i
realized
it
really
good
light
and
refreshing
an
excellent
german
pilsner
weve
got
a
customer
who
has
bought
nearly
10
cases
of
this
this
year
and
i
can
see
why
high
drinkability
for
those
who
like
pilsners
not
my
style
so
i
wasnt
impressed
enough
to
really
enjoy
this
beer
as
it
didnt
separate
itself
from
any
other
german
pilsner
it
went
down
very
easy
but
was
just
very
basic
to
me
d
this
is
a
really
nice
german
pilsener
rich
bitterness
balanced
with
malt
really
really
nice
a
staple
at
gourmet
haus
staudt
bright
and
clear
gold
with
a
dense
white
cap
this
is
a
great
looking
beer
it
smells
great
too
spicy
and
grassy
noble
hops
at
the
forefront
with
a
clean
lager
yeast
character
beneath
the
hops
smell
bold
and
fresh
nearly
overwhelming
the
light
pilsner
malt
backbone
dry
and
sharp
on
the
palate
zesty
and
spicy
hop
flavors
are
prominent
theres
a
sturdy
but
extremely
dry
and
clean
malt
profile
in
fact
this
is
a
remarkably
clean
beer
in
general
the
finish
is
long
and
very
bitter
and
sharp
showing
just
enough
restrain
to
make
it
quaffable
and
refreshing
wow
this
beer
really
impressed
me
excellent
for
the
style
supremely
drinkable
d
see
above
even
better
that
its
under
5
abv
pours
a
pretty
clear
golden
yellow
with
a
decent
white
head
malty
aroma
has
firm
fruity
tone
that
is
mainly
apple
and
banana
and
just
a
bit
sweet
malty
slightly
fruitysweet
flavor
is
rather
pleasing
smooth
somewhat
tingly
texture
leaves
a
fruity
subtly
sweet
finish
i
find
the
drinkability
to
be
good
all
in
all
it
may
not
exhibit
astounding
qualities
but
there
is
enough
complexity
interesting
things
going
on
to
make
this
quite
an
enjoyable
beer
i
would
not
at
all
mind
having
it
again
o
easy
nothing
special
but
nice
to
drink
the
beer
pours
a
very
light
yellow
color
with
a
large
white
head
the
aroma
is
corn
wheat
skunk
and
grassy
hops
the
flavor
is
wheat
pilsener
malt
and
grass
medium
mouthfeel
and
medium
carbonation
the
beer
smelled
a
lot
more
skunked
than
it
tastes
but
it
was
still
very
disappointing
overall
drinkability
is
really
good
ive
been
drinking
a
lot
more
lagers
than
im
used
to
recently
but
i
have
to
say
that
this
beer
adds
rather
than
detracts
from
the
experience
i
would
definitely
get
this
again
notes
this
isnt
the
most
impressive
german
pilsener
ive
ever
had
however
it
is
one
of
the
purest
and
maybe
most
authentic
to
history
it
was
supposed
to
showcase
a
very
pale
light
clean
beer
well
this
is
it
nbthis
review
was
written
with
the
beer
served
very
cold
the
body
was
typical
and
drinkability
would
have
been
decent
if
not
skunked
in
all
honesty
i
would
need
to
try
this
fresh
to
be
fair
to
it
as
it
is
if
you
see
it
avoid
it
as
with
most
of
the
european
imports
id
like
to
try
one
fresh
from
the
brewery
i
feel
that
the
transport
has
probably
affected
this
brew
in
some
ways
drinkability
pretty
good
i
thought
it
was
good
for
a
lighter
beer
despite
the
cons
its
actually
quite
drinkable
and
im
hoping
that
the
pastdueitude
and
maybe
light
infiltration
has
to
do
with
the
funk
ill
gladly
try
it
again
d
very
nice
pilsener
that
would
be
welcome
at
any
backyard
barbecue
a
tad
shy
on
character
but
thats
what
adds
to
the
drinkability
easily
the
least
offensive
green
glass
german
pilsener
i
have
had
in
a
long
time
perhaps
ever
jever
seems
to
be
a
typical
northen
german
beer
primarily
a
localregional
pub
beer
d
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
pilsner
and
i
am
shocked
that
it
has
such
a
low
score
it
is
flavorful
and
well
balanced
and
worthy
of
more
attention
if
someone
doesnt
like
pilsners
as
a
whole
then
they
shouldnt
be

the
beer
at
all

nice
stealthily
shifts
to
a
dry
aftertaste
interesting
not
complex
but
not
simple
either
at
first
i
thought
the
sweetness
would
stick
around
cloyingly
but
not
at
all
loving
the
bitter
afterburn
a
nice
change
from
the
american
pils
from
victory
and
sam
adams
simply
different
breeds
of
course
crisp
yet
smooth
without
a
sense
of
thinness
despite
the
light
color
and
general
unheaviness
it
sugests
a
very
nice
pils
very
quaffable
in
quantites
but
best
with
food
i
bet
definitely
a
sessionable
brew
not
recommended
even
as
change
of
pace
beer
poured
from
a
green
11
2
oz
bottle
has
a
pale
yellow
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
a
combination
of
sweetness
and
skunky
taste
is
crisp
slightly
sweet
finishing
a
tad
bitter
feels
light
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
is
a
mediocre
beer
d
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
there
are
others
in
the
style
that
i
would
pick
first
but
this
is
still
a
decent
beer
to
drink
for
a
while
i
had
this
at
a
bar
before
attending
a
wine
event
i
felt
i
needed
a
beer
before
a
night
of
wine
i
was
not
familiar
with
this
beer
and
overall
not
impressed
however
one
thing
that
was
interesting
was
the
uniquely
fruity
aroma
and
flavor
that
was
more
reminiscent
of
a
kolsch
than
a
pilsner
i
would
try
it
again
but
not
sure
how
many
times
after
that
a
basic
pilsner
the
crispness
refreshment
factors
are
there
but
flavor
a
bit
basic
and
in
the
end
no
different
than
the
hundreds
of
other
german
czech
pilsners
on
the
market
poured
into
a
sam
adams
glass
very
clear
pale
yellow
in
color
with
a
decent
head
and
laced
ok
the
aroma
says
german
pilsner
but
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
dry
and
bland
tasting
beer
i
had
picked
it
up
from
seeing
it
in
the
300
beers
to
drink
book
but
i
really
think
there
are
a
lot
better
brews
out
there
than
this
one
it
was
drinkable
great
pairing
to
a
delicious
beef
carpaccio
with
spargel
and
swiss
cheese
one
of
the
spargel
specials
and
pilsener
is
great
with
spargel
very
solidly
drinkablei
would
love
to
try
it
fresh
on
tap
but
the
bottle
is
for
sure
my
standby
on
late
nights
in
berlin
overall
very
easy
to
drink
alone
or
pair
with
food
a
good
pilsener
but
not
a
great
one
worth
a
try
for
the
dry
twist
in
the
style
d
overall
fair
i
was
hoping
for
amazing
greatness
but
such
things
are
elusive
here
still
a
nice
pilsener
that
is
something
beyond
the
everyday
i
see
this
great
with
roasted
peanuts
light
summer
fare
or
cheese
pizza
im
not
going
to
run
out
and
get
more
of
this
right
now
but
if
i
were
looking
for
an
easy
pilsener
id
have
it
again
without
thinking
twice
the
feel
is
quite
crisp
and
the
body
is
light
pale
straw
color
with
an
offwhite
bubbly
head
that
hangs
around
in
a
small
layer
for
a
long
time
the
aroma
is
musty
but
pleasant
a
hint
of
malt
but
mostly
a
faint
hoppy
aroma
tastes
surprisingly
nice
given
its
soso
aroma
the
hops
are
great
and
are
blended
nicely
with
the
malty
flavor
crisp
dry
and
very
refreshing
with
a
respectable
bready
body
to
it
all
i
could
think
about
was
how
great
this
would
be
with
a
salmon
steak
perfect
for
seafood
overall
a
classic
german
pils
which
must
be
the
benchmark
for
the
dry
example
hops
are
masterfully
used
not
only
in
the
scent
flavor
but
the
texture
as
well
possibly
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
subtle
hop
utilization
ive
ever
tried
world
classic
d
this
beer
is
fantastic
glad
i
finally
saw
it
show
up
in
ca
i
should
have
bought
more
than
the
one
single
it
could
give
the
legendary
reality
czeck
a
run
for
its
money
and
thats
saying
something
a
great
surprise
the
preeminent
example
of
the
german
style
drank
from
the
bottle
on
the
porch
on
a
warm
afternoon
crisp
and
clean
traditional
pils
style
pours
golden
and
light
minimal
head
was
told
by
a
few
german
friends
that
this
beer
is
big
in
germany
right
up
there
with
warsteiner
for
the
locals
easy
drinkable
and
classic
not
much
complexity
but
its
a
german
pilsnser
and
will
be
continued
to
be
consumed
by
this
advocate
the
taste
is
light
and
clean
with
a
nice
bitterness
from
the
hops
seems
very
balanced
a
great
lighter
beer
i
could
see
myself
drinking
these
in
multiples
i
wish
i
had
picked
up
more
than
just
one
good
pils
friesland
is
special
to
me
my
uncles
name
beings
with
fries
he
was
also
born
in
deutschland
us
army
parents
d
overall
a
very
solid
german
pils
a
solid
refreshing
beer
for
a
nice
warm
day
not
as
complex
as
what
the
american
craft
brewers
have
been
pulling
off
with
this
style
but
a
good
find
nonetheless
pours
a
light
golden
with
a
thin
pure
white
head
that
leaves
some
scant
lacing
smells
fresh
slightly
grainy
and
with
a
nice
bitter
snap
the
taste
is
also
crisp
and
bitter
with
a
nice
snap
if
anything
the
tight
bitterness
grows
on
the
finish
extremely
refreshing
and
less
soft
than
i
remember
this
being
on
tap
really
a
lovely
porch
beer
on
a
hot
day
excellent
use
of
hops
married
to
a
crisp
pilsner
with
none
of
the
softness
of
the
czech
style
excellent
d
not
terrible
but
i
had
to
force
myself
to
finish
my
pint
worth
trying
but
i
wont
have
it
again
i
had
this
beer
a
long
time
ago
and
didnt
enjoy
it
so
much
now
with
a
more
mature
palate
i
can
say
this
is
a
good
example
of
the
german
pils
variety
d
if
those
shamwow
commercials
taught
me
anything
its
that
the
germans
always
make
good
stuff
this
isnt
the
best
pils
ive
ever
had
but
its
a
fine
example
regardless
d
very
easy
to
drink
several
of
these
would
make
for
a
good
lawn
mowing
beer
a
very
decent
pilsener
much
better
than
any
of
the
american
macros
golden
pour
with
a
nice
tight
head
that
eventually
dissipates
mild
pilsner
grass
straw
quite
musky
that
is
the
headline
of
the
beer
a
nice
straw
musk
that
seems
to
make
the
beer
give
it
an
earthy
quality
a
nice
bitter
finish
well
balanced
mild
apple
malt
honey
peppery
pilsner
with
an
earthy
quality
to
it
dry
good
carbonation
would
like
to
see
a
bit
more
minty
quality
a
worthwhile
beer
but
one
that
needs
a
lot
more
malt
for
balance
and
drinkability
had
this
on
tap
at
the
capital
ale
house
in
richmond
downtown
pours
a
nice
golden
color
in
a
pilsner
glass
it
had
a
soft
hoppy
floral
smell
quite
soft
in
the
taste
and
ends
with
a
nice
crispiness
got
the
same
floral
tase
in
the
finish
with
a
good
amount
of
dryness
quite
easy
to
drink
a
pretty
good
example
of
the
german
pilsner
style
will
try
again
drinkability
it
could
be
a
bit
fresher
and
would
probably
be
much
better
on
tap
though
this
still
was
fairly
solid
tastes
is
full
of
those
hops
in
the
german
use
of
the
plant
not
the
american
overwhelming
destroyer
hops
an
easy
drinker
and
fizzy
light
mouthfeel
some
interesting
soft
floral
tones
add
complexity
slightly
musty
likely
better
fresh
from
the
tap
but
not
too
bad
from
the
bottle
the
taste
is
soft
light
flavour
with
a
faint
breadyhoney
malt
base
under
very
dominant
hops
withherbalfloral
hop
flavour
being
light
and
airy
again
but
without
much
competition
from
the
malt
the
hop
bitterness
is
not
truly
strong
but
again
has
little
competition
and
the
herbalgrassy
almost
medicinal
bitterness
with
faint
hint
of
lemon
rind
sticks
all
around
the
mouth
dominating
from
start
to
finish
and
lingering
stuck
to
the
sides
of
the
toungue
and
cheek
in
the
right
circumstances
it
could
be
very
satisfying
but
overall
is
too
light
in
character
and
the
bitterness
though
not
strong
is
too
insistent
pours
a
clear
pale
yellow
one
inch
head
of
a
white
color
good
retention
and
decent
lacing
smells
of
yeast
cleanliness
very
slight
hops
and
some
pale
malt
fits
the
style
of
a
german
pilsener
mouth
feel
is
smooth
and
crisp
with
a
high
carbonation
level
tastes
of
pale
malt
yeast
cleanliness
and
a
slight
metallic
flavor
overall
nothing
i
would
try
again
and
not
a
good
example
of
a
german
pilsener
drinkability
a
nice
refreshing
drinkable
pils
with
no
discernable
faults
and
some
pleasant
virtues
i
could
easily
have
several
servings
of
this
one
a
nice
clean
well
made
pilsner
style
beer
i
first
became
aware
of
jever
through
michael
jacksons
book
and
i
have
sought
this
beer
for
years
the
beer
poured
a
light
yellow
with
a
twofinger
head
and
lots
of
visible
carbonation
the
nose
is
kind
of
similar
to
a
macro
with
a
bit
of
hops
the
taste
is
a
tiny
bit
of
malt
followed
by
a
surprising
amount
of
fairly
bitter
hops
with
some
floral
and
citrus
notes
the
mouthfeel
is
a
a
little
thin
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
this
is
a
pretty
average
beer
worth
a
try
if
you
can
get
it
for
cheap
thus
the
score
above
after
purchasing
a
12
sixpack
of
this
beer
to
compare
to
other
pilseners
in
a
tasting
this
was
rated
the
worst
beer
out
of
14
all
because
it
was
horribly
skunked
poured
from
the
bottle
a
reddish
golden
with
thin
white
head
that
lasted
for
much
of
the
glass
and
left
good
lacing
nose
is
grainy
similar
to
a
macro
and
the
mouthfeel
of
this
medium
bodied
beer
is
somewhat
tingly
flavor
is
an
odd
mix
of
grain
chocolate
and
tobacco
all
of
which
led
to
a
short
dry
finish
this
beer
is
can
be
identified
by
its
extremely
herbal
smell
and
taste
it
has
a
nice
golden
color
with
a
white
head
the
extremely
herbal
taste
causes
for
a
very
bitter
reaction
in
order
to
maximize
the
taste
from
this
beer
it
is
strongly
recommended
that
it
be
poured
into
a
tulip
or
pilsener
style
glass
notes
a
decent
brew
i
could
have
a
few
on
a
really
hot
daybut
nothing
special
going
on
here
recent
discovery
as
i
move
thru
the
thousands
of
world
beers
found
it
at
our
local
consumer
beverages
beer
store
in
wny
this
is
a
local
establishment
that
has
lots
of
international
and
microbrew
beers
available
for
retail
sale
pleasant
taste
little
hoppy
short
head
foam
maybe
ill
find
it
at
ocktoberfest
in
munich
next
year
as
usual
if
it
tastes
good
i
drink
it
d
the
finish
just
seems
a
little
off
not
that
the
bitterness
is
wrong
necessarily
but
just
not
quite
balanced
in
my
opinion
its
crisp
and
refreshing
but
not
all
that
delicious
honestly
taste
wise
one
of
the
best
german
pils
i
have
had
it
is
very
unique
which
is
hard
to
achieve
in
pils
very
clean
easy
drinking
with
great
lingering
flavours
not
a
bad
german
pilsner
i
would
like
to
see
the
beer
get
shipped
in
a
brown
bottle
so
when
it
sits
on
the
shelf
its
a
little
more
protected
from
the
light
a
very
drinkable
german
pils
i
am
not
sure
how
many
ibus
jever
has
but
it
is
substancial
for
a
pilsner
i
would
imagine
the
mouthfeel
leaves
something
to
be
desired
but
in
summation
this
beer
is
light
refreshing
and
goes
great
with
seafood
i
would
recommend
this
one
in
the
spring
or
summer
if
you
wanted
to
cool
down
bright
golden
in
appearance
more
lively
caronation
from
german
pilseners
tonigth
oh
yeah
jever
is
one
of
those
brews
ive
been
meaning
to
try
for
a
long
time
since
early
on
in
my
beer
drinking
however
i
now
see
green
bottled
industrial
euro
pils
versus
handcrafted
small
brewery
that
i
have
dreamt
of
head
forms
thick
after
a
vigorous
pour
fine
even
lacing
just
completely
sticks
to
the
sides
of
pint
aroma
is
full
of
moderate
sweet
cereal
grains
pale
biscuit
and
slight
honey
tones
come
through
with
a
dry
heaping
load
of
hop
bitterness
in
their
as
well
much
more
saaz
in
this
situatino
flavor
is
full
of
bitter
skunked
hop
flavor
damn
green
bottles
i
wouldnt
fear
this
bottle
as
much
if
it
werent
for
the
damn
green
bottle
i
see
on
the
website
they
make
this
in
cans
that
would
be
ideal
for
a
round
of
golf
or
summer
concert
mouthfeel
is
full
of
more
dryness
and
spicy
hop
character
with
clean
crisp
carbonation
providing
burps
in
my
direction
drinkability
is
solid
all
around
not
the
best
version
of
a
german
pils
but
i
can
see
why
its
looked
up
to
in
many
folks
journey
to
find
fantastic
beer
on
tap
good
lacing
neutral
aroma
and
appearance
a
little
yellowdrying
below
average
mouthfeel
nothing
to
write
home
about
tad
of
hops
lawnmower
wasnt
horrible
but
flavour
is
minimal
and
not
too
drinkable
i
wasnt
getting
much
here
maybe
on
a
different
night
recommended
d
wouldnt
be
bad
to
put
down
with
some
food
the
carbonation
is
a
little
insane
but
its
drinkable
drinkability
pretty
drinkable
though
perhaps
not
more
so
than
average
for
the
style
ive
had
better
pilseners
and
considering
this
is
a
style
that
has
a
very
definite
place
and
time
its
probably
not
one
id
seek
out
again
but
i
dont
regret
buying
it
once
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
beers
when
you
get
tired
of
ipas
dipas
is
trappist
and
all
that
you
can
always
go
to
jever
ive
had
better
pils
and
doubt
i
would
pick
up
jever
again
given
there
are
other
offerings
readily
available
in
my
area
dany
number
of
these
would
be
wonderful
at
any
given
time
or
placesolid

a
very

perhaps
a

not
nearly
as
good
as
some
domestic
examples
prima
pils
and
brooklyn
d
its
odd
that
while
i
dont
find
this
beer
to
be
exceptional
in
any
way
i
can
easily
see
myself
drinking
this
beer
any
time
i
wanted
a
pils
it
was
very
easy
to
drink
and
i
liked
it
enough
that
i
would
return
for
another
drinkability
is
good
there
is
decent
flavor
here
with
mildly
impressive
compexity
despite
a
very
simple
palate
a
crisp
but
certainly
not
clean
feel
along
with
a
starchy
character
that
leans
toward
dry
i
suppose
more
husky
than
normal
dry
but
you
get
the
picture
maybe
an
odd
buttery
texture
kind
of
lingers
the
drinkability
is
decent
i
guess
with
an
abv
just
under
5
but
trust
me
i
doubt
ill
be
drinking
another
one
any
time
soon
jever
poured
straight
from
a
tap
comes
out
an
almost
transparent
gold
with
a
one
finger
white
head
straight
into
a
jever
glass
the
hops
and
wheat
aromas
were
present
lemon
lime
and
other
citrus
flavors
pulled
through
with
a
hoppy
after
note
it
was
a
refreshing
beer
and
very
easy
to
drink
great
for
a
session
beer
a
very
nice
pilsener
probably
one
of
the
more
bitter
pilseners
ive
had
but
nothing
short
of
delicious
hmmmm
this
wasnt
a
terrible
pils
but
everything
just
seemed
kind
of
subdued
at
times
id
definitely
like
to
revisit
this
in
a
keg
sometimes
as
i
dont
think
the
green
bottle
did
it
any
favors
the
green
bottle
of
jever
original
friesland
pilsner
dons
a
simple
yet
attractive
green
and
gold
label
the
beer
pours
a
clear
pale
golden
color
the
aroma
is
a
balanced
mixture
of
grassy
hops
and
pale
malt
with
a
slight
twist
of
lemon
the
beer
is
light
and
highlights
a
bitter
dryness
throughout
a
slight
hint
of
breadiness
provides
some
balance
as
the
beer
finishes
quick
and
dry
overall
i
think
it
would
be
refreshing
on
hot
summer
day
d
disappointing
and
not
very
drinkable
bland
flavor
overall
less
then
average
in
every
category
d
would
definitely
like
to
try
this
again
i
think
this
one
was
tapped
at
the
end
of
the
keg
however
i
didnt
get
charged
for
the
beer
which
was
nice
ive
been
looking
to
try
this
ontap
no
green
bottles
allowed
and
was
quite
pleased
it
looked
a
clear
gold
with
a
little
white
lacing
and
had
a
mild
sweet
grainy
aroma
that
reminded
more
of
a
czech
pils
like
budvar
but
then
in
the
taste
there
was
a
relative
hops
explosion
or
at
least
a
bitterness
on
par
with
snpa
it
was
big
grassy
herbal
hops
malted
with
a
balancing
light
caramel
malt
very
tasty
there
was
a
very
pleasant
lingering
bitterness
you
cant
usually
find
in
massproduced
pilsners
but
damn
there
it
was
al
in
all
a
winner
one
of
the
better
pilsners
ive
tried
m
d
moderate
carbonation
a
bit
of
zing
ive
had
this
before
and
recall
it
being
a
bit
sweeter
smoother
this
particular
bottle
seemed
like
it
may
have
been
rather
skunked
i
look
forward
to
rereviewing
it
in
the
near
future
but
this
one
ended
up
being
the
first
beer
other
than
notable
poor
quality
macros
that
i
have
poured
halfthrough
unfortunate
an
excellent
example
of
a
german
pilsner
unfortunately
i
dont
think
this
beer
travels
well
in
a
green
bottle
it
would
have
been
better
to
taste
this
one
from
a
brown
bottle
bright
gold
with
a
fluffy
white
head
that
held
fairly
well
and
left
some
nice
lace
nose
was
hoppy
kind
of
funky
and
stinky
and
musty
with
a
mildly
sweet
malt
backbone
taste
was
the
same
hops
played
the
main
role
with
a
mild
malty
thing
happening
nice
dry
bitter
finish
on
the
heavy
side
of
light
bodied
very
food
friendly
and
a
great
refresher
d
not
my
first
choice
of
pilsener
but
for
my
first
taste
this
wasnt
too
bad
i
would
like
less
acidity
in
the
hop
flavor
i
could
drink
several
of
these
in
a
session
since
they
are
not
overly
malty
the
hop
flavor
gives
a
certain
dryness
that
makes
it
better
than
average
drinkability
wise
review
translated
from
french
5272008
a
nice
easy
to
drink
beer
that
went
well
with
our
meal
selsection
a
decent
beer
for
a
pilsner
it
has
the
light
vegetable
light
malt
light
straw
color
that
youd
expect
mainly
a
clean
brew
with
slight
noble
hop
character
not
skunked
perhapse
a
bit
of
graininess
acidity
and
sulferlike
aromas
flavors
are
pretty
mellow
and
viscous
for
a
pils
a
good
beer
to
enjoy
with
a
pizza
or
a
hot
dog
d
easy
to
drink
as
it
has
not
real
character
but
it
would
only
really
be
good
as
a
bar
or
party
drink
not
a
beer
for
enjoying
by
itself
overall
a
pretty
good
pils
worth
a
try
lay
this
one
on
your
boring
lager
drinking
buddies
and
they
wont
know
what
hit
them
jever
pilsener
is
to
my
mind
one
of
the
classic
interpretations
of
the
german
style
a
good
solid
pils
that
im
likely
to
return
to
again
overall
a
very
good
pils
very
spicy
and
easy
to
drink
d
unbalanced
and
clumsy
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
with
a
fluffy
frothy
white
head
aromas
of
zesty
grassy
noble
hops
graham
cracker
malts
and
subtle
honey
crisp
and
clean
light
bodied
and
refreshing
dry
bitter
hoppiness
supported
by
a
nice
solid
grainy
sweetness
good
pils
the
body
is
fairly
light
a
small
bit
sweet
up
front
but
finishes
quite
dry
crisp
carbonation
lends
a
hand
to
the
bitter
hops
flavor
good
balance
between
hops
and
malts
if
not
a
bit
skewed
towards
the
hops
very
easy
to
drink
i
could
easily
drink
a
six
pack
of
this
on
a
hot
summers
day
and
tomorrow
is
officially
the
first
day
of
summer
here
so
i
might
have
to
pick
up
a
whole
sixer
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
fantastic
pillowy
white
head
that
left
plenty
of
lacing
on
the
glass
i
could
smell
the
cracker
like
malt
and
grassyhaylike
hops
from
the
pour
i
could
almost
smell
how
dry
this
brew
will
be
the
taste
is
of
dry
malt
and
grassy
hops
has
an
almost
skunky
taste
to
it
the
feel
is
dry
and
crisp
while
its
dry
it
isnt
astringent
leaves
a
little
bitter
taste
on
the
tongue
a
fine
example
of
a
dry
and
grassy
pilsner
and
one
worth
trying
though
not
sure
i
could
drink
too
many
of
these
in
a
sitting
this
is
one
kick
ass
pilsner
probably
the
best
one
ive
come
across
yet
a
hopheads
pils
the
beer
begins
with
the
fear
that
the
green
bottle
has
given
way
to
the
power
of
the
sun
and
wants
to
serve
up
skunk
ass
statt
hops
fortunately
my
fears
were
quickly
calmed
by
a
beautiful
straw
colored
pils
topped
by
soft
fine
bubbled
head
the
head
was
my
partner
through
the
beer
test
as
it
stayed
until
the
last
drop
to
make
sure
i
had
smile
on
face
and
i
did
the
aroma
and
flavor
are
unmistakably
friesischherb
the
hops
are
very
herbal
part
spearmint
and
part
floral
this
pairs
nicely
to
a
brisk
malt
aroma
the
flavor
profile
follows
the
aroma
like
its
twin
upfront
is
a
burst
of
hop
bitterness
and
flavor
that
is
neither
mild
nor
overwhelming
i
guess
that
means
nicely
down
the
middle
this
beer
is
northern
german
and
this
means
two
things
in
comparison
to
the
pils
in
the
pretty
part
of
germany
the
south

ein
witz
much
drier
and
more
bitter
general
guidelines
of
course
the
malt
plays
a
background
role
but
plays
its
part
nicely
and
adds
support
to
a
beer
that
would
be
one
dimensional
without
the
support
this
beer
is
all
about
hops
even
the
aftertaste
is
a
dry
hop
flavor
that
urges
you
to
drink
more
to
quench
your
thirst
unfortunately
this
becomes
a
vicious
cycle
and
before
you
know
it
the
kister
is
empty
not
the
best
pils
in
the
country
not
even
close
actually
but
lives
up
to
its
reputation
i
hope
this
beer
in
the
green
bottle
is
able
to
find
you
in
good
shape
i
mean
both
you
and
the
bottle
zum
wohl
pours
a
clear
pale
straw
color
with
a
medium
thick
and
fizzy
white
head
that
burns
away
rapidly
patchy
lacing
aroma
of
mild
hops
and
hay
lightbodied
and
effervescent
with
a
dry
mouthfeel
lightly
bitter
hops
and
sour
fruit
flavors
are
pretty
much
the
only
flavors
the
finish
is
dry
and
hoppy
with
some
sweetness
coming
through
not
as
easy
to
drink
as
most
pilseners
fairly
average
all
around
drinkability
was
moderate
this
beer
was
light
refreshing
and
could
pair
perfectly
with
a
variety
of
dishes
yet
the
intensely
dry
and
bitter
finish
was
a
bit
overwhelming
served
in
a
snifter
the
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
yellow
color
with
a
small
white
head
which
goes
away
very
quickly
the
aroma
is
very
grainy
with
some
skunkiness
it
tastes
sour
and
like
grain
metal
skunk
and
a
bit
of
grassy
hops
not
very
impressive
at
all
mouthfeel
is
light
with
medium
carbonation
drinkability
isnt
good
at
all
too
much
skunkiness
ill
have
to
revisit
this
in
the
future
but
this
bottle
wasnt
good
at
all
and
this
was
even
after
having
drank
a
few
other
beers
tonight
not
recommended
this
is
an
unusual
pilsner
one
worth
trying
crisp
that
one
word
sums
up
the
best
qualities
of
jever
ive
rarely
had
a
beer
as
crisp
and
satisfying
as
this
the
beer
pours
a
clear
yellow
gold
with
a
snow
white
head
the
aroma
is
typical
pilsener
theres
a
noticable
hop
bite
at
first
pleasant
but
not
overpowering
after
the
initial
hop
sensation
theres
a
pleasant
maltiness
thats
enough
to
give
flavor
but
not
enough
to
cloy
the
taste
ends
with
a
crisp
dryness
setting
you
up
for
the
next
pleasing
sip
the
drinkability
is
off
the
charts
with
this
one
i
sat
down
with
one
jever
to
drink
as
i
wrote
my
review
i
had
finished
4
before
i
finsihed
the
review
if
youre
looking
for
a
pilsener
look
no
further
drinkability
very
good
beer
to
have
on
a
cold
andor
damp
day
not
a
quenching
beer
youd
want
after
say
jogging
but
more
of
a
beer
to
reflect
on
and
take
away
the
chill
in
the
air
this
beer
is
one
of
the
more
expensive
german
sixers
youll
buy
and
consequently
the
turnover
rate
may
not
be
too
high
therefore
the
freshness
may
be
questionable
mine
tasted
a
bit
past
its
peak
but
still
very
good
that
said
this
is
an
excellent
beer
and
even
better
on
draught
at
a
good
german
bierstube
worth
seeking
out
rerated
from
green
bottle
poured
golden
and
pure
with
a
solid
white
foam
head
verrry
pilsnerhoppy
aroma
with
a
big
starch
undertow
smooth
with
that
uniquely
german
yellowbeer
starchiness
its
not
offputting
necessarily
but
its
clearly
something
that
for
some
reason
surfaces
only
in
massproduced
beers
ive
downgraded
this
over
my
original
rating
but
this
still
stands
as
a
good
example
of
a
northern
german
pils
nicely
bittered
with
a
solid
sweet
starchy
current
beneath
it
my
original
rating
i
was
much
less
verbose
whenever
this
was
import
on
draft
golden
and
still
with
a
solid
head
solid
consistency
and
vaguely
bittered
smooth
and
nice
finish
pours
a
nice
clear
golden
color
with
a
1

fluffy

some
sticky
lacing
and
decent
retention
smell
is
hoppy
and
bitter
taste
is
bitter
noble
hops
up
front
finishing
smooth
with
nicely
balanced
malt
backbone
grainy
taste
as
well
with
a
bit
of
a
burnt
taste
which
gives
it
a
bit
of
a
skunky
quality
although
i
think
that
is
intentional
so
im
not
going
to
detract
for
it
leaves
a
bit
of
a
bitter
aftertaste
but
is
smooth
and
crisp
on
the
palate
not
a
bad
german
pilsener
but
not
my
favorite
overall
this
is
a
phenomenal
beer
its
not
terribly
observant
of
style
it
leaves
other
german
pilsners
in
the
dust
in
terms
of
bitterness
and
power
but
it
is
to
mangle
a
phrase
its
own
beer
unique
confident
and
daring
you
to
like
it
wonderful
mouthfeeldrinkability
extremely
light
in
body
the
effervescence
gives
just
enough
tingle
to
keep
this
from
being
just
average
its
a
damn
easy
beer
to
session
with
enough
of
a
bite
to
warrant
the
next
sip
this
is
a
beer
that
calls
for
less
geekin
and
more
dreenkin
a
nice
hoppy
lager
overall
hard
to
say
how
much
the
potential
oxidation
was
hurting
or
if
it
was
just
exceptionally
bitter
in
any
case
a
bit
harsh
for
a
session
beer
not
impressed
with
this
one
i
should
know
never
drink
anything
in
a
green
bottle
it
lets
light
through
and
ruins
the
beer
making
it
skunky
this
one
was
skunky
very
light
and
left
a
heinekenesk
aftertaste
probably
had
good
ingredients
but
couldnt
taste
them
straw
color
but
poured
not
a
head
like
a
becks
or
heineken
tasted
of
some
malts
few
hops
but
very
skunky
bitter
not
recommended
im
very
disappointed
that
this
wonderful
pilsener
is
not
available
here
in
ontario
this
is
one
of
those
brews
that
i
would
say
to
get
if
it
is
available
to
you
as
it
is
quite
good

and
undoubtedly
the
most
dry

pilsener
ive
tried
as
a
convert
to
much
hoppier
and
aromatic
czech
pils
myself
surprisingly
i
find
this
beer
very
enjoyable
and
im
sure
the
draught
version
could
well
become
one
of
my
favourites
for
this
style
jever
pilsener
isnt
worldclass
but
neither
does
it
deserve
to
be
overlooked
its
solid
across
the
board
and
is
a
worthy
purchase
for
those
looking
for
a
clean
crisp
noble
hoppy
pils
from
a
venerable
german
brewery
if
you
like
hoppy
pilsner
this
beer
is
for
you
i
liked
it
and
if
it
were
more
widely
available
here
i
would
gladly
take
it
over
some
of
the
more
common
german
lagers
like
becks
krombacher
warsteiner
bitburger
this
is
a
good
example
of
a
pilsner
though
nothing
extraordinary
it
poured
a
strawyellow
with
a
decent
head
it
had
a
moderate
to
heavy
carbonation
it
tasted
very
grainy
grassy
and
somewhat
hoppy
overall
it
had
a
refreshing
taste
one
of
the
better
pilsners
from
germany
imo
i
have
no
problems
drinking
this
but
just
an
average
pils
overall
green
12
oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
an
incredibly
clear
light
straw
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
that
falls
to
a
full
coat
over
top
a
very
active
carbonation
boils
from
the
bottom
of
the
glass
helping
maintain
the
head
as
the

after
letting
it
sit
i
find
solid
grainy
character
from
the
pilsner
malt
with
just
a
touch
of
honey
sweetness
there
is
a
touch
of
herbal
noble
hop
in
there
but
the
pilsner
malt
is
dominant
flavor
is
definately
dominated
with
grainyness
this
is
followed
by
a
light
herbal
hop
and
a
mild
biterness
and
a
light
metallic
flavor
on
the
finish
id
like
the
hop
flavor
to
be
more
prevalent
in
this
the
feel
is
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
this
one
is
an
okay
pilsner
i
dont
think
i
would
go
out
of
m
way
for
it
again
but
i
wouldnt
turn
it
down
this
to
me
is
one
of
the
better
german
pilsners
ive
had
in
a
while
id
do
a
case
of
this
anytime
mouthfeel
is
light
and
a
bit
dry
with
plentiful
bubbles
throughout
goes
down
smooth
and
has
a
nice
body
for
a
pilsener
the
metallic
twang
leaves
me
not
wanting
another
i
was
happy
to
try
it
but
its
not
something
id
personally
seek
out
again
thanks
to

for
a
330ml
bottle
from
julios
liquors
westborough
ma
a
long
while
back
this
brew
used
to
be
sold
in
33cl
bottles
at
the
discount
shop
on
the
corner
it
used
to
be
my
favorite
back
then
light
straw
colour
great
taste
and
especially
the
long
lasting
rough
tingling
dryness
on
the
tongue
meanwhile
i
only
get
it
in
the
specialised
shop
drinks
of
the
world
which
is
also
described
on
this
site
and
where
i
have
to
get
special
brews
at
a
less
moderate
price
these
days
the
taste
is
very
crisp
hop
accented
malt
at
first
just
a
shadow
but
eventually
a
bready
grainy
malt
emerges
the
herbal
bitter
hops
remains
the
feature
of
this
pils
light
bodied
sharp
and
tangy
it
finshes
dry
a
fine
thirst
quencher
a
good
pils
but
not
a
great
one
jever
would
be
a
reasonable
summer
beer
if
the
skunk
didnt
ruin
the
picnic
i
had
mixed
expectations
about
this
brew
but
found
it
to
be
solidly
refreshing
and
enjoyable
it
pours
a
deep
gold
color
exceedingly
clear
with
a
brilliant
white
head
the
aroma
is
full
of
bready
malts
mixed
with
floral
herbal
hops
slightly
grassy
and
just
a
hint
of
earthy
sulfury
mustiness
the
taste
is
malty
and
full
of
breadlike
character
this
quickly
subsides
into
a
brisk
abrupt
hop
kick
finishes
with
a
decidedly
bitter
snap
refreshing
and
solid
i
enjoy
a
good
german
pilsner
and
this
one
is
worth
trying
again
poured
out
a
light
golden
color
with
a
huge
white
foamy
head
smell
consisted
of
hops
grass
some
light
oranges
and
a
very
very
faint
skunky
smell
but
didnt
affect
anything
taste
was
alright
started
out
quite
bitter
good
for
a
pils
grassy
hops
in
the
beginning
with
some
grains
and
malts
mixing
in
the
middle
and
ends
with
some
spicy
hops
quite
good
mouthfeel
was
lightmedium
and
slighty
overcarbonated
not
bad
this
beer
has
to
be
fresh
though
this
is
a
very
drinkable
pilsner
one
of
my
favorites
and
i
love
the
signature
glass
in
the
aftertaste
the
hop
again
strong
and
persistent
mouthfeel
prickley
carbonation
is
great
makes
the
beer
very
drinkable
and
smooth
with
food
drinkability
is
good
i
would
not
drink
this
all
night
well
maybe
the
hops
in
this
are
very
distinct
and
spicy
floral
good
stuff
all
around
blinding
sunyellow
grainy
and
biscuit
nose
tiny
and
stringy
carbonation
an
initial
blast
of
hallertau
german
hops
that
become
a
bit
bitter
very
dry
and
thirstquenching
some
oats
and
biscuitlike
offerings
marry
well
with
the
hops
finish
is
dry
slightly
metallic
creamy
and
lipsmacking
good
an
outstanding
pilsner
highly
drinkable
it
is
what
it
is
now
for
the
taste
the
mild
sweet
flavor
is
helped
greatly
by
a
spicey
hop
finish
much
more
crisp
and
flavorful
than
most
pilsners
and
maybe
even
a
little
too
bitter
for
me
for
this
style
but
id
take
overly
bitter
with
flavor
over
lack
of
flavor
any
day
the
carbonation
is
just
right
and
the
beer
pairs
nicely
with
burgers
sausages
of
course
im
reviewing
this
in
the
middle
of
winter
id
might
just
rate
it
higher
if
i
was
enjoying
this
brew
at
a
midsummer
bbq
this
one
seems
to
be
unique
for
its
color
and
the
readily
apparent
hops
light
gold
in
color
with
a
snowwhite
fairly
long
lasting
head
and
some
sticky
lace
the
aroma
of
fresh
cut
hay
with
a
herb
garden
smells
fresh
hop
a
faint
sulfuric
smell
and
a
faint
maltiness
the
malt
body
is
somewhat
light
and
has
a
clean
herbal
and
slightly
grainy
character
the
abundantly
applied
hallertau
hops
are
spicy
lightly
citrusy
and
a
bit
metallic
creating
a
bit
of
a
back
of
the
throat
edginess
and
bite
the
taste
of
hard
water
adds
to
the
intense
bitterness
this
is
the
other
hipsterdujour
beer
in
brooklyn
along
with
pbr
everybody
drinks
it
thinking
they
are
drinking
something
exotic
but
they
are
really
just
drinking

cool
sounding

and
matching
glassware
clean

classic

nose
slightly
skunky
catpee
herbal
and
floral
taste
differs
very
little
from
the
aroma
heavy
on
the
skunkiness
like
a
heineken
but
with
a
bit
more
character
clean
crisp
lively
finish
pretty
decent
german
hops
profile
mouthfeel
is
quite
carbonated
with
a
bit
more
body
than
one
might
expect
could
be
a
good
session
brew
if
youre
into
this
sort
of
thing
but
its
best
paired
with
some
spicy
food
or
sausages
average
in
every
way
the
beer
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
color
with
a
1
white
head
that
quickly
fades
to
lacing
the
aroma
is
decent
it
has
a
slightly
grainy
pale
malt
scent
with
a
dry
yeast
finish
and
a
bit
of
skunkiness
the
taste
is
awful
it
has
a
watery
pale
malt
flavor
with
a
little
bitterness
and
a
dry
finish
it
goes
down
cleanly
but
has
a
horrible
aftertaste
the
mouthfeel
is
average
it
is
a
low
bodied
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
this
is
an
average
pilsner
it
lacks
flavor
and
mouthfeel
its
one
and
done
for
me
pours
a
light
gold
with
with
a
pretty
large
head
that
settled
pretty
quickly
into
a
soapy
like
topa
nice
fresh
aroma
of
grass
and
green
herbs
along
with
a
slight
iron
note
but
its
very
slight
taste
is
quite
bitter
and
herbal
a
big
dose
of
hops
in
this
pilsner
just
lightly
sweet
after
awhile
but
the
hops
are
most
prevalent
in
this
brew
thats
for
sure
a
interesting
pilsner
quite
bitter
but
a
real
quaffer
would
go
down
real
easy
on
summer
day
the
bitterness
is
quite
refreshinga
nice

the

vein

that
extends
half
an
hour
beyond
the
last
sip
a
quality
pils
along
the
lines
of
veltins
and
eku
this
is
one
id
been
looking
forward
to
giving
a
try
mostly
since
everyone
said
this
was
the
hop
pils
to
give
a
try
well
now
that
ive
had
it
its
certainly
good
with
a
betterthanaverage
hop
bite
to
it
though
it
doesnt
quite
reach
the
level
of
the
great
american
pilsners
this
is
still
a
damn
enjoyable
beer
one
that
id
have
again
and
proof
that
something
good
can
come
in
a
green
bottle
had
this
in
the
bottle
while
in
germany
and
gave
it
a
3
5
this
rating
is
for
the
ontap
version
which
i
recently
enjoyed
at
redbones
hmm
i
do
like
beers
ontap
anyway
no
surprise
at
the
color
clear
golden
yellow
when
served
i
was
able
to
enjoy
watching
the
slowly
rising
carbonation
i
also
liked
the
perfumey
hop
aroma
it
came
with
medium
bodied
i
found
slight
crispness
and
some
sweetness
from
the
malt
i
also
have
written
in
my
notes
a
bit
of
a
woody
note
overall
more
enjoyable

enjoyable
with
some
spicy

crisp
goes
down
easy
with
mild
malt
presence
at
the
end
but
overall
bland
and
unflavorful
not
worth
the
effort
of
a
return
visit
not
something
i
would
go
out
of
my
way
to
get
but
decent
pours

average

what

is
to
the
hallertau
wish
it
was
available
in
my
area
beer
is
good
happy
pilsener
beering
nice
soft
mouthfeel
lets
the

do
its
best
to
balance
the

quite
drinkable

refreshingly
bitter
poured
an
ultra
clear
and
light
yellowstraw
color
bright
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
creamy
head
of

foam
topped
this
beer
off
yes
the
aroma
is
pure
and
good
bitter
graininess
and
super
sharp
hints
of
breadiness
and
citrus
fruit
the
taste
is
very
clean
and
sharp
with
a
very
crisp
finish
i
love
the
simple
pilsner
and
this
is
a
near
perfect
example
of
the
style
somewhat
buttery
on
the
tongue
with
a
sharp
but
pleasant
hop
bite
this
is
liquid
bread
an
excellent
pilsner
that
i
need
to
buy
more
often
i
can
only
hope
my
homebrew
comes
out
nearly
as
good
as
this
as
previously
mentioned
this
is
a
very
interesting
pilsener
unlike
most
pilseners
i
dont
think
i
could
partake
in
a
session
with
this
brew
even
though
the
abv
is
average
for
the
style
this
one
deserves
a
bit
of
contemplation
it
affects
the
drinkabilty
somewhat
but
this
is
a
brew
that
should
be
sampled
by
all
at
least
once
even
if
lagers
are
not
your
thing
serving
this
from
a
brown
bottle
or
evenbetter
on
tap
would
improve
this
tenfold
a
good
brew
that
has
the
potential
to
be
even
better
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
was
the
bitterness
both
at
the
front
and
the
back
of
the
mouth
and
it
remained
all
the
way
through
this
is
too
bitter
to
be
a
session
beer
and
struck
me
as
heineiken
on
steroids
the
hop
taste
is
extreme
and
very
germanchech
although
i
cannot
quite
place
it
by
name
a
good
beer
but
not
for
everybody
the
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
very
crisp
and
had
a
super
clean
finish
no
aftertaste
at
all
this
beer
is
extremely
drinkable
and
was
paired
perfectly
with
the
potato
pancakes
i
was
eating
one
of
my
favorite
pilsners
this
beer
is
a
revelation
to
the
drinker
whos
grown
accustomed
to
bland
anonymous
lagers
highly
recommended
in
reading
the
other
reviews
of
this
beer
im
hoping
that
the
jever
i
was
in
some
way
a
bad
bottle
it
poured
with
a
nice
foamy
head
that
slowly
faded
away
the
color
was
a
dark
yellow
and
it
smelled
very
dry
i
dont
know
what
to
say
about
the
flavor
other
than
i
thought
it
was
awful
it
was
the
only
beer
in
my
sample
case
that
i
had
to
pour
our
i
know
others
have
said
that
they
liked
this
beer
in
reviews
but
all
of
the
memers
in
my
beer
club
agreed
that
we
disagree
with
the
reviews
on
beer
advocate
the
most
interesting
and
satisfying
german
pilsner
i
have
had
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
really
fluffy
white
head
smells
like
a
little
bit
of
grain
and
a
hint
of
skunk
the
taste
is
nice
biscuity
maltiness
and
a
little
hopiness
with
a
tiny
hint
of
skunkiness
a
free
beer
given
tome
by
a
coworker
who
received
it
from
her
sister
who
received
it
from
a
german
client
clear
gold
with
just
the
slightist
green
tint
under
a
white
one
fingered
head
that
lacks
real
pils
body
but
lingers
well
down
the
glass
and
leaves
some
excellent
lacing
the
nose
is
strong
but
seems
skunky
to
me
definitely
a
sour
cabbage
tone
to
it
the
mouth
is
very
prickly
but
carries
a
decent
amount
of
body
the
taste
yup
there
are
hops
here
good
strong
floral
hops
with
some
breadiness
for
balance
but
the
bread
fades
long
before
the
bitter
leaving
a
wonderful
hoppy
bite
at
the
back
of
the
jaw
the
aftertaste
is
pure
bitter
which
definitely
appeals
to
me
yes
my
tastes
have
changed
and
jever
will
no
longer
get
the
snub
from
me
this
pils
poured
a
clear
yellow
color
with
creamy
white
foam
that
persisted
but
eventually
settled
and
clung
to
the
glass
a
bit
the
smell
was
modest
bready
malt
with
a
touch
of
grain
the
taste
was
sweetish
malt
with
floral
and
bitter
hops
and
a
light
touch
of
bread
and
grain
the
mouthfeel
was
smooth
with
medium
body
and
moderate
carbonation
this
was
a
decent
pils
though
a
tad
too
sweet
a
friend
brought
me
back
a
nonwidget
pint
can
of
this
upon
his
return
from
his
homeland
of
germany
it
pours
a
yellowlight
golf
color
with
a
nice
large
white
head
and
it
leaves
a
little
lacing
on
the
glass
very
clear
body
on
this
one
the
aroma
is
of
haycorn
husks
light
malts
and
pleasing
hops
great
smelling
for
a
german
pils
no
skunkiness
here
the
flavor
is
very
clean
and
smooth
it
has
a
nice
strong
taste
upfront
that
leaves
the
palate
completely
bare
after
a
second
very
interesting
makes
it
sooo
easy
to
drink
the
upfront
taste
is
filled
with
soft
malts
and
some
slightly
spicy
hops
as
well
i
detected
a
nutty
taste
as
well
possibly
almonds
great
beer
one
of
the
few
choices
widely
available
in
köln
for
someone
who
does
not
want
a
kölsch

flavor
light

with

finishes

a
very
good
pilsner
to
me
this
is
a
good
beer
to
drink
on
a
hot
summer
day
when
you
do
not
want
anything
too
heavy
it
has
that
nice
german
crispness
upfront
that
leads
to
a
nice
dry
taste
and
texture
not
much
in
the
way
of
color
or
smell
i
found
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
on
the
thin
side
but
with
enough
character
to
warrent
a
decent
rating
it
has
sort
of
a
tangy
and
slighty
bitter
appeal
and
certainly
goes
with
all
kinds
of
food
a
good
session
beer
but
not
great
in
my
opinion
poured
a
bright
yellow
pils
color
very
little
film
of
a
head
and
a
little
film
for
lace
not
much
of
a
nose
just
a
trace
of
hallertauer
scents
and
some
toned
down
florals
taste
was
definite
hallertauer
and
other
hops
and
a
little
drop
of
sugar
had
a
very
thinned
out
malt
and
fairly
long
dry
finish
slid
down
easy
like
water
a
plain
old
pilsener
but
luckily
not
as
bad
as
an
american
one
but
no
czechvar
either
taste
and
finish
werent
that
appealing
to
me
straw
gold
good
fluffy
white
head
and
plenty
of
condition
good
level
of
hop
aroma
with
a
faint
hint
of
celery
nicely
malt
sweet
with
balancing
hop
flavour
and
an
intensly
hop
bitter
finish
that
is
slightly
chalky
in
a
world
of
pilseners
that
all
taste
the
same
this
beer
is
one
of
the
best
of
its
style
its
a
drinkable
pilsner
but
the
dryness
is
a
little
rough
in
most
aspects
throughout
the
taste
and
feel
and
some
may
be
put
off
by
it
a
very
hoppy
beer
but
a
beer
with
balance
nonetheless
and
an
unusually
deep
solid
mouthfeel
for
a
pilsener
the
brewing
here
is
a
real
lesson
in
how
to
incorporate
a
highhopbitter
element
into
a
brew
without
that
element
sort
of
floating
free
from
the
rest
of
the
beer
in
an
untamed
way
and
coming
off
as
astringent
really
an
exceptional
beer
that
you
dont
see
too
often
in
america
at
least
not
often
enough
and
one
that
sets
a
standard
for
pilseners
the
world
over
a
pale
yellow
in
color
that
is
crystal
clear
big
chunky
head
that
leaves
a
nice
lace
to
the
bottom
of
the
glass
not
much
for
aroma
though
nice
taste
that
was
crisp
and
clean
with
a
dry
hoppy
aftertaste
certainly
not
the
best
pilsner
but
definitely
not
the
worst
i
prefer
this
to
most
others
pilseners
when
i
can
find
it
fresh
and
not
lightstruck
its
a
real
treat
used
this
beer
to
wash
down
my
plate
königsberger

my
friend
brought
me
two
bottles
from

this
was
one
of
my
favorite
beers

printed
on
the
front
label
easy
to
read
upon
breaking
the
seal
the
room
fills
with
an
intense
smell
of
sticky
hops
there
is
a
beautiful
honey
burned
suger
and
nougat
maltiness
coursing
underneath
but
from
nose
to
tail
this
beer
is
all
about
the
noble
bud
thats
dry
bitter
dry
but
not
out
of
balance
on
the
back
are
the
words
zutaten
wasser
gerstenmalz
hopfenextrakt
hopfen
im
struggling
with
my
own
dogma
is
it
ok
to
add
hop
extract
it
seems
like
a
manipulation
and
in
fact
the
hoppiness
while
very
entertaining
seems
a
bit
exaggerated
almost
cartoonish
i
would
complain
more
if
i
thought
they
were
hiding
something
but
it
seems
clear
that
the
other
components
are
very
well
done
my
conclusion
is
that
they
are
shooting
for
an
extremely
hoppy
style
which
if
they
used
fresh
or
at
least
whole
hops
would
be
prohibitively
expensive
i
give
this
beer
high
marks
for
uniqueness
and
personal
sentiment
although
this
review
is
for
draft
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
word
herb
on
the
bottled
product
means
dry
or
bitter
and
is
indicative
of
this
north
german
pilsners
very
dry
style
crystal
clear
and
bright
golden
in
color
with
a
bright
white
head
that
holds
fairly
well
very
nice
appearance
the
aroma
is
quite
hoppy
as
pilsners
go
very
noble
lightly
grassy
and
highly
floral
some
light
grainy
malt
aroma
is
present
as
well
the
body
is
lightmedium
with
a
crisp
carbonation
the
flavor
starts
dry
with
a
burst
of
hop
bitterness
warming
as
it
crosses
the
palate
to
reveal
a
firm
grainy
maltiness
and
finishes
long
and
bitter
the
emphasis
is
definitely
on
hop
bitterness
with
around
45
ibus
very
one
sided
in
many
ways
but
also
with
quite
alot
of
finesse
a
somewhat
unique
refreshing
and
enjoyable
pils
very
drinkable
this
is
a
very
good
german
bier
a
very
light
and
crisp
looking
brew
out
of
the
bottle
nice
and
effervescent
the
smell
is
not
as
wheaty
as
say
some
but
still
very
good
aroma
the
first
sip
is
indicative
of
things
to
come
this
is
what
a
german
pilsener
should
be
it
brings
plenty
of
flavor
and
aromatics
to
the
party
one
of
my
favorites
prost
a
mainstay
on
tap
at
macgregors
my
local
for
some
time
i
thought
since
i
recently
visited
germany
and
had
a
sort
of
personal
renaissance
of
german
pilslagers
that
i
would
give
it
a
try
as
it
turned
out
it
was
a
perfect
way
to
start
out
the
night
before
moving
on
to
something
a
bit
more
substantial
theres
too
many
choices
here
to
lock
into
one
beer
light
biscuity
grain
beneath
a
lively
but
reserved
hop
well
done
and
a
prime
example
of
the
style
notes
definitely
a
thirst
quencher
pils
light
enough
to
suck
down
on
a
very
hot
day
while
sweating
at
the
bbq
grilling
some
turkey
sausages
to
pair
with
the
next
jever
very
good
german
pils
its
bitterness
makes
up
for
anything
it
lacks
in
its
taste
an
underated
german
pils
overall
average
pilsener
that
is
slightly
too
watery
and
lacking
in
flavors
it
is
refreshing
and
almost
feels
hydrating

also
rather
bready
nice

and
flavor
throughout
quite
a
lot
is
going
on
here
and
this
is
one
of
my
favorite
continental
pilseners
relatively
easy
to
track
down
and
with
an
almost
alelike
fruitiness
that
makes
it
stand
out
from
the
pack
its
crisp
and
creamy
with
a
high
carbonation
and
interestingly
a
bit
too
much
to
the
medium
body
its
clean
up

something
building
lightly
but
just
stiegls
pilsner
is
a
classic
in
my
opinion
one
thats
easy
to
find
and
when
fresh
amazingly
satisfying
its
all
things
a
good
pils
should
be
precise
clean
refreshing
dry
hoppy
and
immensely
drinkable
its
a
shame
this
beer
doesnt
get
the
love
it
deserves
either
way
i
recommend
buying
some
great
crackery
pilsner
malt
character
nice
bittering
hops
slightly
earthy
but
theres
a
touch
of
citrus
that
is
very
welcome
crisp
and
refreshing
this
is
a
great
example
of
the
style
floral
hops
are
subtle
but
noted
very
well
constructed
and
clean
poured
a
gorgeous
golden
color
with
a
two
finger
white
head
that
stuck
around
for
almost
the
entire
glass
and
a
wonderful
amount
of
bubbles
an
excellent
looking
pilsner
scents
of
crisp
lager
yeast
grainy
malt
and
flowery
hops
a
very
crisp
and
clean
aroma
a
nice
classic
pilsner
scent
flavor
begins
with
a
crisp
combination
of
herbal
and
floral
noble
hops
and
some
nice
grainy
malt
moves
into
more
herbal
and
floral
flavors
some
more
dry
grainy
flavors
and
a
slight
hint
of
sweet
pilsner
malt
finishes
dry
with
a
nice
hit
of
floral
and
herbal
noble
hop
flavors
aftertaste
is
floral
and
herbal
noble
hops
a
very
nice
simple
onenote
clean
flavor
profile
just
like
a
pilsner
should
be
it
is
refreshing
and
pleasant
mouthfeel
is
light
bodied
with
moderate
carbonation
and
a
semidrying
feel
a
good
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
mouthfeel
very
true
to
style
overall
this
is
an
excellent
german
pilsner
it
is
crisp
and
clean
in
aroma
flavor
and
mouthfeel
as
the
style
should
be
it
isnt
complex
at
all
but
for
this
style
that
is
a
good
thing
and
for
a
nice
refreshing
lager
it
is
amazingly
well
done
rjt
overall
note
a
bad
pilsner
but
i
dont
see
how
this
is
vastly
better
or
worse
than
most
although
in
retrospect
this
was
better
than
i
had
remembered
it
o
all
about
the
bottle
label
i
dont
know
why
youd
want
to
drink
this
otherwise
tastes
like
heineken
or
any
other
similar
pale
euro
lager
mr
average
in
all
aspects
overall
basic
beer
accessible
clean
and
wellmade
but
unexciting
admittedly
im
not
the
biggest
pils
fan
but
this
was
a
solid
beer
that
is
an
above
average
representation
of
the
style
i
did
drink
it
straight
out
of
the
bottle
but
it
was
a
very
cool
commemorative
2013
holiday
bottle
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
a
half
inch
of
large
bubbled
foam
appeared
on
top
of
the
beer
the
smell
was
actually
quite
pleasant
strong
pineyhop
smell
the
taste
of
this
beer
is
pretty
standard
for
a
pils
if
anything
it
is
a
bit
on
the
weak
side
but
i
do
appreciate
that
it
is
less
harsh
in
the
mouth
than
many
other
brews
in
the
style
overall
i
would
say
that
as
far
as
pils
go
this
is
a
solid
choice
and
very
drinkable
but
there
are
many
superior
austrian
brews
to
choose
from
o
for
me
this
pils
isnt
something
that
stands
out
from
the
pack
but
it
is
a
fine
example
of
the
style
that
deserves
a
solid
recommendation
i
would
definitely
like
to
give
stiegl
another
taste
in
the
future
o
not
too
flavorful
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
decent
representation
of
style
its
definitely
not
one
of
the
better
beers
ive
had
in
the
style
i
always
look
forward
to
good
quality
pilsners
on
tap
and
this
one
definitely
did
the
trick
for
me
recently
it
provides
everything
i
expect
a
germanstyle
pilsner
to
carry
without
taking
too
many
risks
id
imagine
this
is
dramatically
inferior
in
the
bottle
but
at
least
this
is
easy
to
find
on
tap
if
im
looking
for
a
good
session
beer
that
is
tasty
as
well
as
taking
a
break
from
offerings
that
usually
plummet
my
ass
to
the
ground
overall
drinkability
one
of
the
better
commercial
european
pilseners
o
the
nice
clean
character
has
just
a
touch
of
sweetness
which
compliments
the
pils
malt
and
a
hint
of
hops
there
are
no
off
flavors
and
everything
is
balance
making
this
very
easy
to
drink
light
yellow
and
crystal
clear
with
a
small
head
it
looks
like
theres
a
lot
of
carbonation
being
released
no
lacing
at
all
and
only
a
very
slight
retention
of
the
head
the
aroma
is
of
crackery
malt
and
a
little
orange
peel
light
crisp
and
refreshing
as
i
drink
very
slight
bitterness
and
slight
pungent
hop
characteristic
to
it
as
well
the
mouthfeel
is
pretty
decent
with
good
carbonation
overall
this
is
an
enjoyable
pilsner
but
nothing
about
it
stands
out
i
never
considered
a
beer
of
this
style
to
be
one
for
a
long
session
but
this
would
have
fit
that
bill
perfectly
the
carbonation
was
just
right
and
there
was
just
enough
of
a
floral
and
earthy
feel
to
this
to
keep
it
light
while
never
feeling
watereddown
this
was
a
great
example
of
the
style
and
maybe
the
best
beer
that
ive
had
out
of
a
green
bottle
in
quite
a
long
time
overally
this
is
a
solid
german
pilsener
that
i
would
recommend
others
trying
grassy
and
sort
of
a
clingy
mouthfeel
i
thought
the
nose
was
a
little
catty
but
nothing
that
would
put
me
off
it
so
much
better
than
the
grolschheineken
business
that
too
often
overshadows
this
stuff
overall
this
is
a
pilsner
worth
seeking
out
and
having
in
your
fridge
buy
some
today
o
its
a
nice
representation
of
the
style
pours
a
slightly
hazy
strawyellow
with
a
white
foamy
head
and
lots
of
sticky
lacing
smells
of
cereal
grain
spicy
hops
and
freshcut
wild
flowers
tastes
of
clean
and
sweet
malty
flavors
followed
by
a
subtle
but
unmistakable
dose
of
saaz
hop
bittering
mouthfeel
was
surprisingly
fullbodied
and
low
carbonation
with
a
nice
buttery
feel
after
swallowing
long
bittersweet
aftertaste
sweet
malty
flavours
are
even
more
pronounced
after
it
warms
up
a
little
overall
one
of
the
best
germanstyle
pilsners
ive
ever
had
all
good
overall
it
is
alright
the
initial
smell
and
taste
were
bitter
but
after
one
drink
it
got
better
the
appearance
smell
and
taste
were
all
ultimately
average
with
nothing
really
special
to
note
really
it
was
not
bad
and
not
really
great
just
beer
i
couldnt
help
think
of
hugo
stiglitz
every
time
i
saw
the
name
of
the
beer
which
made
for
a
fun
time
overall
this
beer
is
not
outstanding
in
any
way
but
it
isnt
bad
either
overall
you
cant
do
much
better
for
a
european
pils
dont
overlook
this
one
right
up
there
with
budvar
and
pilsner
urquell
the
taste
is
evergreenish
minty
with
notes
of
honey
sickle
and
the
ubiqutuous
cooked
vegetables
denouncing
the
probability
of
corn
or
just
slack
brewing
procedures
nonetheless
regardless
of
what
central
european
lager
category
it
belongs
to
its
still
a
pretty
unremarkable
beer
drinkability
is
pretty
good
classic
and
well
executed
not
much
here
its
good
but
simple
leaning
on
the
sweet
side
but
not
cloying
now
i
need
to
go
to
austria
and
drink
a
real
fresh
one
much
more
smooth
and
palatable
than
some
in
this
style
all
of
the
typical
pilsner
character
without
too
much
to
distinguish
it
good
crisp
and
dry
with
a
nice
initial
fruit
character
sessionable
and
quite
refreshing
o
beer
looks
great
and
it
has
some
complexity
it
just
falls
short
of
pilsner
greatness
miss
that
zingy
hop
edge
that
pilsners
bring
i
guess
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
though
its
heavy
on
the
malts
which
gives
a
sweeter
tone
to
it
fairly
one
dimensional
but
its
consistent
a
nice
enough
beer
that
goes
beyond
the
typical
yellow
fizzy
stage
kind
of
a
small
bottle
though
which
doesnt
make
too
much
sense
for
such
a
low
abv
beer
imo
m
light
body
moderate
carbonation
overall
would
definitely
go
back
to
this
one
d
unspectacular
but
also
unoffensive
for
the
most
part
im
not
overly
familiar
with
german
pilseners
but
to
me
this
seems
like
a
decent
drinkable
representation
of
the
style
it
may
be
a
patio
beer
at
best
but
theres
certainly
worse
ones
out
there
than
this
o
another
highly
drinkable
enjoyable
beer
from
stiegl
the
brewery
is
making
some
great
light
lagers
that
prove
the
style
isnt
inherently
bland
overall
this
is
a
meh
beer
the
maltyapplejuicey
taste
is
strange
in
a
lager
and
the
mouth
feel
while
extremely
drinkable
isnt
very
compatible
with
the
heavier
feeling
that
the
lager
leaves
in
the
stomach
this
brand
is
not
very
common
in
the
u
s
but
a
clear
example
of
a
good
pils
overall
nothing
too
complex
but
a
nice
and
light
pilsner
that
i
could
have
several
glasses
of
an
excellent
summer
beer
happy
to
have
found
this
on
draft
this
beer
tastes
very
much
like
the
other
pilsners
ive
had
from
central
european
countries
its
light
yet
refreshing
and
still
has
that
ever
so
mild
skunkiness
that
i
come
to
expect
with
these
particular
beers
not
a
favourite
but
still
definitely
drinkable
i
must
have
enjoyed
it
enough
since
i
had
3
the
finish
ends
up
dry
enough
however
with
just
a
little
bit
of
lingering
bitterness
body
is
medium
light
carbonation
is
moderate
enough
but
still
crisp
draft
gives
this
an
appealing
mouthfeel
thats
both
smooth
and
clean
a
highly
drinkable
pils
but
for
me
not
a
standout
o
this
was
a
decent
pilsner
a
little
skunky
but
interesting
flavors
and
aromas
not
a
bad
pils
when
it
comes
down
to
it
i
would
drink
this
over
many
bmcs
and
other
lighter
imports
overall
not
bad
i
had
low
expectations
with
a
screw
top
and
green
bottle
which
seemed
to
affect
it
a
bit
with
a
slight
oxidation
and
hint
of
skunk
but
not
completely
sure
on
that
as
it
warms
and
the
more
i
drink
it
the
more
a
slight
bitter
skunky
flavor
comes
through
that
gives
it
a
bit
more
of
a
macro
lager
flavor
but
still
worlds
better
than
most
macro
lagers
the
malts
and
decoctionlike
layers
were
pretty
nice
hops
could
have
been
a
bit
more
pronounced
overall
too
drinkable
crisp
and
fairly
tasty
i
could
pound
quite
a
few
of
these
back
to
back
no
problem
o
too
carbonated
to
my
palate
but
a
good
beer
got
a
fresh
bottle
so
none
of
the
skunky
notes
that
others
seem
to
get
a
little
metallic
in
places
but
nothing
too
bad
a
well
done
mass
produced
beer
austrian
pilsner
i
think
i
like
it
oddidnt
like
this
beer
much
glad
i
bought
a
single
this
beer
runs
about
10
00
a
sixpack
which
i
find
to
be
a
ripoff
just
doesnt
cut
it
in
my
opinion
that
is
all
d
i
hope
this
brew
is
better
out
of
the
bottle
cause
i
really
cant
move
past
the
metallic
flavor
here
everything
else
seems
solid
appearance
smell
mouth
palate
is
my
only
real
complaint
otherwise
crushable
i
found
a
500ml
can
of
stiegl
during
a
trip
to
canada
the
beer
pours
a
clear
palegolden
yellow
copper
with
a
fair
size
foamy
white
head
the
smell
had
malt
hops
slight
citrus
the
taste
starts
somewhat
dry
and
then
finishes
with
a
slight
bitter
hop
taste
the
mouthfeel
is
lighter
in
body
with
decent
carbonation
overall
it
is
a
decent
beer
that
is
definitely
sessionable
drinking
this
brings
back
great
memories
from
traveling
to
and
through
salzburg
and
austria
great
looking
and
smelling
the
taste
was
less
than
i
remember
at
the
source
overall
this
is
a
decent
pilsner
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
as
well
as
cheap
and
commonly
available
worth
a
try
if
your
picking
out
random
tall
cans
overall
better
than
average
for
sure
with
so
many
run
of
the
mill
euro
beers
available
in
my
area
this
one
at
least
has
a
taste
different
enough
to
set
it
apart
from
the
rest
while
not
my
favorite
style
this
one
goes
down
easy
and
is
a
nice
pleasant
one
this
would
be
a
great
beer
for
a
hot
day
its
light
but
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
it
from
being
boring
not
hard
to
see
why
this
is
a
popular
style
me
like
o
this
is
a
nice
pilsener
a
nice
value
too
worth
a
try

and
some

on
the

a
mild

on

quickly

after

this
beer
has
a
high
level
of
carbonation
with
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
a
bit
too
much
carbonation
in
my
opinion
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
that
is
very
easy
to
drink
o
a
decent
easy
drinking
beer
there
are
some
better
pilsners
out
there
but
this
is
a
decent
option
overall
a
solid
presentation
for
the
style
easy
to
drink
and
worthy
the
purchase
if
youre
looking
for
something
crisp
clean
and
easy
to
drink
not
sure
if
i
would
distinguish
it
from
other
beers
in
the
style
pours
a
clean
pale
yellow
with
a
white
head
in
the
aroma
a
sweeter
malt
small
pils
hops
and
quite
a
basic
lager
in
the
taste
sweet
malt
in
a
quite
standard
european
lager
a
smooth
and
lighter
bodied
mouthfeel
with
a
small
dryness
in
the
aftertaste
for
a
standard
lager
a
step
above
a
macro
but
eh
nonetheless
o
wasnt
pleased
with
the
beer
at
all
pours
a
golden
color
very
clear
with
a
rocky
white
head
minimal
lacing
head
dissipates
in
a
few
minutes
the
nose
is
very
bready
toast
and
grain
flavor
has
a
fesh
grain
character
slight
bitterness
from
hops
but
not
much
quaffable
summer
brew
not
my
favorit
style
but
a
good
representation
here
thats
a
unique
pilsner
but
not
necessarily
one
worth
having
again
overly
sweet
not
enough
else
going
on
d
this
is
probable
is
just
what
a
pils
should
be
but
not
quite
like
the
other
pils
ive
had
abv
is
good
and
over
all
not
a
bad
beer
worth
looking
for
because
it
is
from
the
mother
land
o
not
my
style
but
i
found
it
very
drinkable
this
one
looked
decent
after
the
pour
clear
yellowgold
colour
with
a
thin
layer
of
fine
bright
white
bubbles
on
top
good
head
retention
lasting
most
of
the
way
through
the
glass
with
some
sticky
and
spotty
lacing
to
start
floral
aroma
with
some
sulfury
hops
sweetish
dry
malt
notes
bitterness
was
medium
to
low
with
more
cereal
and
dry
malt
flavour
floral
hops
and
a
quick
finish
that
had
a
hint
of
fruit
the
body
had
some
heft
supported
by
moderate
carbonation
and
an
offdry
finish
making
for
an
enjoyable
drinkable
texture
not
bad
overall
unfortunately
im
not
a
big
fan
of
the
sulfury
character
i
got
from
the
aroma
so
its
not
a
beer
id
go
back
to
again
from
the
pint
can
stamped
06721
sampled
on
july
29
2011
the
aroma
is
totally
european
with
a
fine
balance
of
vibrant
german
malts
and
baked
bread
but
also
something
off
kilter
like
glue
still
it
was
not
terrible
just
different
the
body
is
creamy
and
smooth
the
taste
is
also
smooth
and
malty
sweet
i
thought
this
was
a
fairly
average
to
good
pilsener
overall
a
really
great
unique
pilsener
excellent
summertime
brew
and
something
i
will
seek
out
again
a
good
smooth
pils
nice
start
and
finish
medium
mouthfeel
a
very
drinkable
beer
would
definitely
order
another
apparently
i
had
some
of
this
during
my
german
trip
back
in
2000
so
i
figured
id
give
it
another
go
to
get
some
idea
of
what
i
had
way
back
when
it
pours
a
clear
lemony
straw
topped
by
a
finger
of
white
foam
the
nose
comprises
musty
wheat
flowers
light
honey
and
a
touch
of
green
apple
skin
the
taste
holds
notes
of
light
grass
flowers
wheat
light
banana
and
green
apple
flesh
im
actually
a
little
surprised
at
the
fruitiness
here
its
not
a
negative
but
im
not
entirely
convinced
its
a
positive
either
the
body
is
pretty
light
with
a
moderate
carbonation
and
a
crisp
dry
finish
overall
a
nice
pils
worthy
of
a
trip
down
a
decadelong
memory
lane
o
its
an
alright
beer
im
sure
i
can
down
a
few
of
these
on
a
hot
day
with
no
problem
not
bad
but
not
great
overall
maybe
my
favorite
pils
im
gunna
need
to
out
it
up
against
spaten
but
they
are
close
for
my
favorite
o
not
bad
very
german
i
typically
prefer
the
more
floral
and
soft
pils
i
can
find
stateside
but
this
is
a
nice
change
of
pace
worth
experiencing
but
nothing
thats
going
to
send
you
running
for
more
o
a
nice
example
of
the
style
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
500ml
bottles
are
a
good
format
ookay
a
solid
pilsner
with
great
balance
and
terrific
freshness
and
cleanliness
very
refreshing
and
enjoyable
o
ok
fresh
smell
of
citrus
good
beer
for
a
warm
day
and
when
you
are
thirsty
o
miles
below
the
goldbrau
shouldve
been
better
than
this
but
severely
lacking
in
character
for
a
pilsner
i
could
drink
this
over
and
over
even
over
a
few
of
the
czech
classics
but
this
is
still
not
quite
up
to
snuff
when
compared
to
the
masterful
brews
from
the
neighbors
to
the
north
taste
clean
crisp
malt
with
noticeable
noble
hops
presence
and
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
on
the
end

behind
the

malt
is
faintly
noticeable
noble
hops
are
strong
on
the
palate
lending
a
big
kick

and

flavors
the

light
and
dry
while
the

is

bitter

lingering

is
in

nice
golden

with
a
big
fluffy
head
body
carbonation
is
a
little
light
but
thats
really
my
only
complaint
appearance
is
closer
to
a
vienna
style
lager
in
many
ways
than
a
pilsener
good
funkiness
in
the
aroma
and
the
aroma
is
overall
very
clean
nothing
objectionable
at
all
drinks
very
easy
too
its
clean
on
the
tongue
and
very
refreshing
mouthfeel
is
also
good
its
quite
crisp
overall
i
recommend
this
beerit
proves
once
again
that
many
of
the
basic
brews
of
europe
are
made
with
more
care
than
the
american
adjuncts
mostnote
that
there
is
still
a
lot
of
crap
from
the
continent
too
a
drinkable
yet
very
average
german
pilsner
thishad
a
little
hint
of
lemon
in
it
which
made
this
surprisingly
better
to
me
other
than
that
not
much
is
special
with
it
its
yellow
and
crisp
grassy
to
an
extent
but
not
100
could
be
much
worse
i
would
pick
this
up
over
most
pilsners
out
there
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
quite
sesionable

perhaps
could
have
been
a
bit
crispermore

overall
a
great
drinkable
pilsener
if
you
are
looking
for
a
decent
simple
pils
with
no
fruity
tones
and
just
simplicity
linked
to
style
this
is
your
beer
of
choice
a
summer
beer
at
its
simplest
very
easy
drinking
and
satisfying
in
a
no
nonsense
light
beer
kind
of
way
d
decent
pilsner
could
have
a
6
pack
with
ease
fine
gateway
beer
for
timid
newbies
there
are
better
pilsners
from
czech
rep
and
many
in
the
usa
not
a
must
try
maybe
its
because
its
been
a
while
but
i
forgot
how
good
and
drinkable
germanstyle
pilseners
are
because
its
so
ubiquitous
i
feel
like
pilsener
is
often
overlooked
even
frowned
upon
by
serious
beer
drinkers
i
believe
theres
a
reason
this
style
became
so
popular
and
this
is
a
great
example
of
a
top
notch
pils
a
good
pils
with
no
flaws
for
style
d
very
good
i
havent
had
too
many
pilseners
but
am
enjoying
the
various
aspects
of
this
it
is
a
full
and
flavorful
beer
without
being
very
heavy
could
enjoy
quite
a
few
over
the
course
of
a
warm
afternoon
or
just
as
a
starter
to
an
evening
like
i
am
doing
right
now
pretty
easy
to
drink
not
super
complex
but
is
what
a
german
pils
should
be
the
skunk
is
a
bit
of
a
turn
off
but
not
overdone
worth
trying
had
this
on

at
twisted

in
toronto

and

mild

but
pleasant
mild

in

a
very
decent

with
a
pretty
good
white
head
with
plenty
of
staying
power
nose
is
fairly
aromatic
with

as
well
as
some

slightly
bitter
earthy
and
spicy
with
some
raw
grain
underneath
good
brisk
carbonation
on
a
light
body
drinks
fairly
well
overall
with
nothing
more
useful
to
say
if
you
need
the
perfect
summer
afternoon
beer
this
is
it
fairly
drinkable
as
long
as
it
stays
cold
warmth
is
not
doing
this
beer
any
favors
not
your
typical
pils
easydrinking
and
hoppydry
with
a
good
body
aided
by
the
malt
and
corn
one
of
my
favored
goto
pilsners
i
thought
that
this
was
a
pretty
tasty
pils
glad
to
have
tried
it
its
a
nice
beer
but
pretty
average
taste
is
really
malty
creamy
and
smooth
it
reminds
me
of
budvar
its
got
a
mellow
full
mouthfeel
overall
a
super
tasty
beer
worth
trying
pale
lagers
pilsners
or
otherwise
will
not
reinvent
you
the
wheel
if
youre
expecting
the
moon
for
your
nose
and
the
stars
for
your
mouth
youre
drinking
the
wrong
kind
of
beer
to
me
these
lagers
come
down
to
one
question
is
it
clean
unadulterated
palatable
and
pleasurable
if
yes
then
im
happy
with
it
which
means
im
sure
as
hell
happy
with
this
drinkability
is
excellent
i
could
drink
this
all
day
this
was
a
surprisingly
tasty
beer
nose
is
full
of
hay
and
light
grain
along
with
some
lemony
hops
flavor
follows
and
has
a
decent
body
as
predicted
by
the
nose
full
and
a
bit
grainy
with
a
touch
of
musk
yet
not
overly
coarse
or
bready
clean
and
smooth
on
the
feel
yet
without
offering
too
much
character
either
yet
well
balanced
for
what
is
there
this
alllows
for
an
easy
drink
as
the
feel
is
fuller
than
the
pour
might
suggest
and
it
never
becomes
sweet
in
nature
an
easy
drinking
pils
with
a
good
balance
of
flavor
and
texture
o
great
different
and
refershing
clean
lager
note
nothing
exceptional
but
not
really
bad
either
just
an
ok
beer
would
probably
be
a
good
beer
if
you
were
looking
for
something
cold
and
refreshing
is
summer
kind
of
skunky
sulfury
smell
and
taste
that
dominates
somewhat
like
a
grolsch
other
than
that
not
too
exciting
you
have
your
typical
grainy
taste
here
and
a
good
hoppy
taste
in
the
end
pretty
good
beer
this
is
a
balanced
beer
a
little
sweet
here
a
little
off
there
but
overall
not
bad
d
im
almost
done
drinking
this
pint
of
stiegl
already
so
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
id
probably
find
myself
getting
happy
with
this
brew
rather
quickly
the
malty
sweetness
hides
the
alcohol
really
well
and
the
flavor
is
rich
i
think
anyone
getting
into
pilsners
would
like
this
as
an
entry
into
the
style
not
the
most
accurate
version
but
its
good
d
easy
drinking
bier
a
mild
crispness
as
it
finishes
fairly
refreshing
a
tasty
little
pilsner
quite
enjoyable
to
drink
could
have
been
a
bit
more
robust
but
still
a
very
drinkable
brew
d
my
favorite
offering
from
stiegl
a
really
drinkable
beer
that
goes
down
easy
and
with
no
hassle
pours
a
nice
pale
gold
colour
with
a
frothy
head
as
expected
for
the
style
can
smell
the
hops
a
little
bit
but
not
getting
much
else
from
this
one
really
straightforward
refreshing
taste
true
to
the
style
nice
amount
of
hops
pretty
crisp
and
refreshing
and
overall
good
but
nothing
outstanding
overall
a
solid
pilsner
but
one
that
seems
a
bit
scared
to
stray
away
from
convention
a
good
intro
into
the
style
and
is
definitely
worthy
of
a
try
i
get
an
eh
from
this
pilsner
i
would
probably
prefer
the
less
grainy
american
versions

this
beer

for
those
patio
days
with
a
meal
or
an
extended
drinking
session
d
very
refreshing
yet
full
of
flavor
a
perfect
complement
to
almost
any
meal
but
can
hold
its
own
in
the
solo
realm
as
well
a
great
example
of
the
pilsner
style
and
worth
seeking
out
for
any
fans
of
them
pours
a
nice
golden
clear
straw
yellow
with
1
5
fingers
of
white
head
a
lot
of
nice
citrus
notes
some
crackers
and
grains
as
well
some
honey
in
there
as
well
a
lot
of
crackers
and
grain
in
the
taste
some
notes
of
citrus
a
slight
vinousy
character
as
well
sharp
and
crisp
mouthfeel
overall
quite
drinkable
but
not
my
favorite
the
mouthfeel
appearance
and
drinkability
seem
to
be
what
hinder
this
pilsener
nothing
grand
but
it
is
solid
the
best
one
i
have
had
from
a
minikeg
i
bought
a
single
11
2
ounce
green
bottle
of
this
beer
i
havent
had
a
beer
in
four
days
so
the
palate
is
clean
and
ready
for
beer
its
clear
straw
golden
yellow
in
color
with
a
decent
little
white
head
smells
typical
a
german
purity
law
of
1516
beers
sweet
and
malty
just
as
this
style
of
beer
is
intended
to
be
no
other
outstanding
or
unusual
aromas
just
beer
the
taste
reflects
the
smell
perfectly
but
now
a
slight
hint
of
hops
can
be
detected
as
well
nice
texture
with
a
sweet
glaze
that
sticks
to
your
teeth
right
amount
of
carbonation
very
easy
to
drink
for
the
price
this
one
is
worth
a
try
it
should
sink
like
a
ship
on
a
hot
day
poured
from
a
very
cool
looking
propaganda
artlooking
can
this
beer
is
bright
goldorange
in
colour
and
displays
a
fine
bubbly
white
head
which
leaves
dissipates
after
a
short
while
but
leaves
a
good
amount
of
lacing
behind
some
very
nice
grassy
hops
arise
from
the
head
accompanied
by
fresh
bread
like
malts
and
some
apple
and
ripe
tomato
notes
as
well
taste
is
grassy
and
bready
up
front
with
some
very
nice
buttery
notes
giving
way
to
a
dry
slightly
bitter
hop
finish
with
some
subtle
caramel
on
the
linger
i
actually
taste
some
belgianesque
yeast
notes
in
the
midsip
as
well
as
the
beer
rolls
around
in
my
mouth
mouthfeel
is
typical
of
the
style
light
to
medium
bodied
and
very
crisp
with
quite
a
tingly
spicy
carbonation
hit
midsip
and
a
very
clean
finish
as
for
drinkability
this
beer
rates
high
a
few
cans
of
this
pils
would
be
no
problem
to
throw
back
i
have
had
this
beer
before
and
it
will
certainly
have
a
place
in
my
fridge
again
quite
an
enjoyable
refreshing
pils
from
austria
into
an
imperial
pint
pours
a
light
yellow
a
decent
white
head
to
begin
with
no
head
after
a
while
not
much
lacing
either
aroma
smells
of
lemon
grass
slightly
metallic
and
mineral
not
much
pale
malt
taste
is
decent
mostly
hops
in
grassy
mineral
tones
the
mouth
is
nicely
carbonated
light
airy
easy
to
drink
i
sum
its
a
stock
pils
this
beer
pours
a
golden
pale
straw
like
colour
which
is
very
well
carbonated
and
has
a
nice
three
finger
creamy
head
which
hangs
around
for
a
whileit
has
fresh
aromas
of
grassy
hops
and
some
sweet
malton
taste
it
is
exactly
how
it
smells
freshly
cut
hops
with
a
nice
sweet
barley
maltish
finish
quite
a
nice
beer
that
would
be
better
suited
as
a
session
beer
in
the
summer
but
just
wouldnt
crawl
over
broken
glass
for
it
500ml
bottle
pours
clear
gold
with
a
substantial
fluffy
white
head
that
leaves
nice
lacing
smells
very
sweet
and
grassylots
of
noble
hop
character
strong
honey
notes
as
well
sweet
graininess
in
the
taste
with
just
the
right
amount
of
hop
bitterness
to
balance
it
grassy
with
some
earthiness
medium
body
really
pleasant
drinker
this
beer
is
expensive
its
around
13
for
a
6
pack
i
wont
buy
this
beer
for
home
use
even
though
it
is
good
because
the
price
is
just
not
waranted
luckily
there
is
a
small
austrian
cafe
down
the
road
that
serves
it
on
tap
im
not
one
for
pilsners
but
this
was
a
good
one
in
my
opinion
while
i
dont
drink
pilsners
on
a
regular
basis
this
would
probably
be
the
first
one
id
choose
which
as
far
as
im
concerned
is
saying
a
lot
pours
a
very
pale
yellow
with
a
large
white
head
that
leaves
heavy
lacing
on
the
glass
i
was
going
to
lower
the
score
because
the
lack
of
color
but
then
thought
better
of
it
because
it
is
a
pilsner
and
it
did
have
an
impressive
head
and
nice
lacing
the
smell
is
intense
hop
aroma
the
noble
hops
are
on
full
display
earth
herbal
pepper
and
floral
elements
from
the
hops
no
malt
comes
through
in
the
aroma
the
hops
dominate
the
flavor
as
well
nice
herbal
and
pepper
hop
flavor
the
malt
does
lend
a
dry
cracker
quality
in
the
finish
light
body
with
a
very
active
carbonation
nothing
really
special
here
a
very
refreshing
beer
i
like
pilsners
on
the
dry
side
so
this
one
really
appealed
to
me
the
taste
on
the
other
hand
has
only
light
grain
taste
and
is
thoroughly
dominated
by
herbal
piney
grassy
hop
flavour
giving
a
tingly
zesty
feel
and
a
crisp
persistent
bitterness
from
start
to
finish
despite
the
clear
dominance
of
the
hops
and
lack
of
malty
sweetness
it
is
not
actually
too
bitter
though
and
its
very
nice
the
palate
is
terribly
dry
which
is
a
plus
on
my
list
it
tastes
of
earth
mildly
bittered
pale
malt
floral
and
grassy
hops
and
cooked
lemon
with
a
straw
flavored
dry
slightly
bitter
finish
which
lingers
its
very
crisp
with
an
incredibly
satisfying
feel
i
guess
im
a
saaz
whore
since
i
had
three
7373143
4
yeah
that
unfortunate
honey
continues
on
the
front
palate
and
throughout
to
the
finish
a
little
bit
of
bittering
hop
on
the
back
but
very
smothered
by
the
syrupy
character
cant
really
recommend
this
standard
lagery
characters
with
an
unpleasant
cloying
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
quite
smooth
but
thats
about
all
thats
good
about
it
otherwise
very
average
i
would
rate
this
one
lower
but
it
complimented
my
wurst
nicely
literally
16
9
oz
bottle
poured
into
my
pils
glass
producing
a
medium
straw
color
with
a
thick
white
head
and
sticky
sticky
lacing
lively
carbonation
this
ones
good
to
look
at
light
malty
aroma
slightly
sharp
some
bittering
hops
thrown
in
crisp
and
refreshing
this
bites
the
palate
ever
so
slightly
flavor
is
very
well
balanced
theres
a
light
peppery
taste
to
round
out
the
crisp
malt
nicely
hopped
nice
pilsener
highly
drinkable
and
thirst
quenching
while
stiegle
in
not
my
favorite
german
pilsner
it
is
drinkable
and
is
average
or
slightly
above
average
a
pale
looking
golden
color
that
pours
a
thickish
head
that
evaporates
to
a
thin
film
quickly
a
little
bit
of
lacing
that
is
more
spotty
than
anything
else
aroma
is
quite
grassy
or
haylike
with
a
maltiness
to
it
its
not
at
all
subtle
but
i
cant
really
say
i
liked
it
either
there
is
somewhat
of
a
sharp
malt
flavor
grassy
notes
with
a
touch
of
spicy
hops
which
is
nice
finishes
crisp
with
a
fuller
mouthfeel
than
expected
anytime
i
see
the
words
malt
liquor
on
a
bottle
i
get
flashbacks
but
overall
this
beer
is
decent
albeit
a
bit
middle
of
the
road
i
probably
wont
get
it
again
as
i
can
think
of
three
pilseners
ive
had
in
the
past
month
that
are
far
superior
north
coast
scrimshaw
stoudts
and
lagunitas
appears
a
very
pale
straw
golden
hue
basically
like
watered
down
apple
juice
golden
carbonation
has
fine
bubbles
streaming
upward
from
the
bottom
of
my
16
oz
gordon
biersch
glass
head
forms
thick
and
dwindles
down
leaving
behind
even
thin
lacing
with
each
sip
labeled
a
pils
but
definitely
hits
more
along
the
lines
of
a
euro
lager
or
pils
than
a
german
or
czech
style
aromatic
starts
off
with
a
snappy
skunky
hop
flow
with
grapefruit
peel
saaz
and
herbal
tones
galore
light
pale
malt
doesnt
offer
much
sweetness
here
only
clean
mineral
water
notes
with
a
touch
of
metallic
character
coming
across
my
senses
flavor
wise
this
beer
is
clean
with
a
crisp
bitterness
and
dry
finish
definitely
a
mass
produced
austrian
beer
herbal
skunk
weed
hop
notes
run
rampant
i
cant
even
say
pure
saaz
here
more
cluster
hops
than
crisp
classic
noble
hop
flavors
bone
dry
on
the
mouthfeel
carbonation
is
crisp
carries
this
light
bodied
pils
well
but
this
just
cant
compete
with
the
likes
of
penn
kaiser
pils
troegs
sunshine
pils
or
stoudts
pils
drinkabiltiy
overall
i
could
enjoy
this
occasionally
but
with
prima
or
pikeland
in
pa
i
dont
have
to
consider
not
so
fresh
imports
from
germany
or
in
this
case
austria
for
a
beer
which
looks
a
lot
like
a
generic
euro
pale
lager
this
actually
delivers
this
is
a
very
decent
germanstyle
pils
almost
verging
into
the
sharpness
of
the
czech
style
while
theres
only
so
much
you
can
do
with
the
style
this
is
pretty
much
a
spoton
example
d
i
hate
to
beat
the
dead
horse
but
why
oh
why
can
american
macros
or
for
that
matter
american
micros
not
generate
such
a
delicate
and
sophisticated
pils
this
is
the
type
of
quality
session
beer
the
masses
should
be
imbibing
at
taverns
across
america
ive
had
this
beer
several
times
and
its
always
good
it
pours
a
light
golden
color
with
a
small
white
head
about
1
finger
thick
maybe
i
poured
wrong
to
me
the
beer
is
smooth
going
down
a
tad
bit
dry
no
overpowering
smells
either
this
is
probably
my
favorite
pilsner
ive
had
so
far
i
wish
i
could
of
given
a
more
detailed
review
but
im
still
training
my
beer
palette
cheers
had
this
in
a
bottle
i
really
liked
the
lager
was
smooth
easy
drinking
and
wish
it
was
a
hot
summer
day
pours
clear
light
amber
color
with
very
little
head
that
dissipates
quickly
no
lacing
a
somewhat
bitter
nutty
flavor
o
this
drinks
more
like
an
adduct
lager
than
anything
not
one
of
their
best
3
25
pours
a
dark
amber
color
with
a
one
inch
foamy
slightly
off
white
head
that
dissipates
very
quickly
no
real
lacing
is
left
along
the
glass
so
visually
there
is
nothing
at
all
noteworthy
about
this
beer
the
smell
and
taste
is
grainy
and
sweet
i
think
its
actually
a
very
wellbalanced
beer
perfect
amount
of
carbonation
and
just
the
right
amount
of
a
slight
sugary
sweet
caramel
overtone
to
it
a
little
sour
finish
however
this
was
better
than
what
i
was
expecting
matt
brewing
company
did
a
nice
job
with
this
one
overall
a
3
25
is
given
to
saranac
adirondack
lager
from
matt
brewing
company
this
was
pretty
damn
refreshing
after
a
five
mile
hike
on
a
humid
day
in
july
ill
probably
pick
this
up
again
part
of
an
assorted
trail
mix
popping
the
top
yields
a
bready
waft
of
sweet
malt
pours
to
a
orange
yellow
sparkling
colour
with
an
off
white
head
on
the
taste
the
brew
is
a
consistent
balanced
combination
of
the
ready
malts
and
a
noble
like
hoppiness
taste
stays
the
same
throughout
then
the
finish
stays
bitter
and
fades
a
great
brew
for
the
style
spot
on
very
drinkable
and
flavorful
with
a
disguised
5
5
ac
overall
nothing
extraordinary
but
very
solid
i
would
never
turn
down
this
beer
and
would
pick
it
up
again
in
an
instant
very
drinkable
i
like
to
think
of
craft
beer
as
a
caste
system
but
one
that
doesnt
degrade
the
lower
end
of
the
scale
i
put
this
beer
towards
the
bottom
certainly
not
an
untouchable
thatd
be
bmc
but
also
not
royalty
however
i
am
proud
to
drink
this
and
any
saranac
brew
on
the
principle
that
a
i
spent
five
months
doing
trail
work
and
climbing
peaks
in
the
mighty
dacks
and
2
that
matt
brewing
is
100
amerikuhn
from
yootika
new
yawk
o
good
solid
beer
from
saranac
what
you
would
expecteasy
drinking
but
nothing
to
knock
your
socks
off
loses
carbonation
quickly
good
for
the
price
i
would
buy
again
good
staple
to
have
in
the
fridge
overall
not
sure
why
folks
are
hatin
on
it
bc
it
was
a
pretty
good
beer
i
would
definitely
have
it
again
o
this
beer
is
pretty
well
balanced
with
pleasant
amounts
of
sweetness
from
the
malts
and
bitterness
from
the
hops
relatively
easy
to
drink
and
probably
a
good
gateway
beer
for
people
just
starting
out
with
craft
beers
refreshing
and
enjoyable
my
craftexperience
in
college
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
this
was
one
usually
around
for
the
night
an
ok
amber
pours
a
light
amber
golden
color
with
small
head
aroma
of
sweet
malt
and
very
little
hop
presence
flavor
follows
with
a
strong
malt
bill
but
relative
light
on
the
palate
easy
drinking
beer
with
adequate
carbonation
not
a
great
one
but
certainly
drinkable
and
perhaps
a
nice
craft
intro
certainly
not
a
great
beer
but
enough
flavor
to
enjoy
theres
a
sturdy
crispness
to
this
brews
light
to
medium
body
and
its
pretty
clean
though
it
dries
up
a
little
too
fast
into
a
huskier
finish
o
as
i
said
im
suprised
this
beer
isnt
rated
higher
has
an
excellent
crisp
flavor
and
is
extremely
refreshing
could
be
one
of
new
goto
session
beers
recommended
for
people
who
appreciate
a
lighter
yes
still
flavorful
session
beer
or
any
lagerpilsener
fan
overall
it
remains
true
to
the
basics
of
the
style
but
doesnt
provide
any
specific
flavors
that
make
it
stand
out
saranac
adirondack
lager
2013
the
first
beer
i
ever
drank
was
this
brew
it
was
my
introduction
to
the
brewing
world
ive
come
a
long
way
but
i
remember
just
how
great
i
thought
this
was
especially
when
i
tried
coors
or
bud
or
millers
etc
in
subsequent
sessions
good
fluffy
head
reduces
to
strong
lacing
reddish
amber
body
good
carbonation
very
active
hoppy
bitter
smell
sour
apples
and
grapes
smooth
mouth
feel
lemon
grass
nose
wheat
grass
and
mild
hops
middle
palate
skunks
a
bit
in
the
end
to
let
you
know
its
a
lager
but
finishes
clean
a
little
sour
a
little
bitter
then
grass
and
lemons
on
the
back
palate
the
taste
of
a
warm
summers
day
very
refreshing
crisp
after
taste
is
crisp
but
good
generic
lager
taste
bitter
hops
and
light
malt
lemon
bread
if
you
will
a
great
hot
day
brew
good
with
bbq
or
heavy
meals
that
need
a
light
side
great
alternative
to
a
mainstream
lager
like
bud
or
miller
far
smoother
more
refined
third
shift
though
changes
and
game
putting
this
brew
down
a
notch
some
13
years
from
our
first
meeting
my
tastes
have
matured
so
what
was
once
the
standard
and
a
4
in
1999
has
become
a
3
25
in
2013
this
is
a
good
brew
but
average
that
isnt
a
put
down
it
still
holds
the
standard
and
i
would
go
back
to
it
any
time
a
solid
meal
beer
or
a
great
end
of
the
day
kick
back
watching
a
ball
game
beer
good
o
this
is
decent
nothing
stands
out
too
much
which
is
how
the
style
should
be
its
an
easy
drinker
but
there
are
more
appealing
lagers
in
my
area
taste
is
dominated
by
malts
nutty
caramel
toasted
yeast
and
bread
are
present
throughout
with
a
bit
of
orange
peel
in
the
finish
also
has
a
metallic
note
to
it
not
pleasant
but
not
a
dealbreaker
either
has
a
creamy
mediumheavy
body
with
average
carbonation
a
beer
that
is
too
malt
dominant
to
be
a
favorite
of
mine
also
nothing
really
stands
out
here
besides
the
slight
metallic
taste
the
appearance
is
ok
with
a
clear
amber
and
white
neck
that
should
retain
more
since
it
is
a
german
lager
the
aroma
reminisces
graham
crackers
with
a
controlled
diacetyl
taste
the
malt
profile
is
strong
and
the
hop
profile
has
both
the
hallertauer
nobleness
and
the
cascade
exuberance
in
the
taste
the
cascade
becomes
even
more
discrete
i
dont
think
there
is
an
harmony
between
malt
and
hops
but
it
does
not
compromise
the
quality
of
this
beer
the
mineral
taste
in
the
water
is
welcome
and
the
finish
leaves
us
with
a
very
pleasant
hoppy
taste
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
a
pilsener
glass
crystal
clear
gold
with
a
fizzy
head
that
dissipated
relatively
quickly
but
with
some
nice
lacing
smell
was
a
lot
of
malt
a
bit
more
yeasty
than
i
expected
hops
not
really
present
in
smell
tasted
followed
the
nose
malty
as
expected
surprisingly
yeasty
although
only
in
flavor
the
body
was
not
affected
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
despite
the
yeast
with
hops
sneaking
in
at
the
end
to
pinch
off
the
taste
in
my
opinion
there
are
much
better
pilsener
styles
but
this
lager
is
many
steps
above
its
massproduced
contemporaries
poured
a
half
inch
offwhite
head
of
average
lifespan
the
body
is
a
clear
slightly
burnt
orange
and
exhausts
all
effervescence
into
the
small
head
it
smells
mildly
of
malt
the
taste
is
mainstream
lager
with
the
slightest
hint
of
bitter
hops
its
ok
but
just
an
average
mainstream
lager
i
guess
most
people
on
this
site
dont
like
giving
this
inexpensive
and
unflashy
beer
enough
credit
no
it
is
not
in
some
fancy
bottle
no
the
smell
will
not
knock
you
over
and
no
it
doesnt
look
like
its
the
nectar
of
the
gods
but
the
taste
aftertaste
cost
and
chugability
of
this
beer
is
world
class
saranac
attributes
much
of
the
wonderful
taste
of
this
beer
to
the
water
its
uses
from
the
adirondacks
if
thats
true
and
i
believe
it
is
we
should
be
buying
bottled
water
of
that
stuff
the
taste
is
super
smooth
balanced
mild
and
has
a
great
aftertaste
this
is
the
michael
jordan
of
lagers
in
the
class
of
acuras
and
audis
this
beer
is
easy
to
drink
and
tastes
great
on
tap
or
in
a
bottle
i
highly
recommend
this
to
anyone
who
is
looking
to
have
more
than
3
beers
tonight
i
found
the
appearance
of
this
beer
to
be
a
bit
better
than
the
actual
taste
but
the
taste
is
a
significant
upgrade
to
other
beers
priced
about
the
same
o
for
never
trying
this
beer
before
i
am
very
surprised
not
even
8
dollars
for
a
six
pack
and
i
got
more
than
i
bargained
for
saranac
makes
a
very
interesting
yet
refreshing
beer
would
definitely
buy
again
there
is
no
real
wow
factor
here
its
a
run
of
the
mill
beer
only
slightly
above
average
for
me
meh
not
a
bad
lager
smells
rather
pedestrian
with
some
more
toasty
malts
than
usual
as
the
only
real
remarkable
note
the
flavor
is
quite
good
nutty
malt
profile
almost
more
of
a
vienna
lager
with
the
smooth
sweeter
malt
very
sturdy
with
lots
of
body
for
a
lager
a
longtime
staple
of
the
trail
mix
variety
pack
these
always
go
fast
at
my
house
if
you
like
your
light
beer
with
some
girth
still
give
this
one
a
shot
a
true
upstate
ny
classic
o
this
was
an
average
german
pilsener
id
have
probably
have
it
again
depending
upon
what
else
was
served
o
overall
im
not
really
impressed
seems
like
the
tartness
is
a
little
out
of
whack
in
this
beer
doesnt
meld
o
this
beer
is
pretty
refreshing
and
one
id
consider
to
be
above
average
for
the
style
im
not
one
to
drink
too
many
lagers
but
with
the
nice
presence
of
caramel
and
leafy
hops
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
this
one
again
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
oddly
crisp
at
the
same
time
with
averagemedium
carbonation
a
medium
body
and
an
overall
grainy
flavor
that
has
just
enough
herbal
notes
and
hops
to
make
it
decent
while
easy
to
drink
its
just
very
average
and
one
of
the
more
boring
beers
from
the
saranac
lineup
overall
a
good
consistent
lager
thats
light
and
drinkable
but
has
enough
flavor
to
keep
fans
of
more
flavorful
styles
happy
i
like
to
keep
it
around
for
its
versatility
first
off
i
think
this
more
a
vienna
lager
than
a
german
pilsener
it
actually
reminds
me
somewhat
of
sa
boston
lager
but
not
as
good
this
is
a
solid
but
unspectacular
brew
o
a
good
beer
that
has
no
tricks
up
its
sleeves
but
it
doesnt
lead
you
on
that
it
does
poured
a
clear
coppery
shade
with
full
frothy
white
head
head
unfortunately
falls
flat
within
fifteen
seconds
leaving
a
thin
film
that
spots
but
does
not
lace
the
glass
aroma
was
of
moist
hay
and
sweet
taste
is
a
bit
muddled
starting
slightly
sweet
and
of
grain
then
changing
to
a
mildly
bitey
hop
mouthfeel
i
can
only
say
is
stale
that
is
not
the
crispness
i
expect
from
a
pils
certainly
buy
it
again
this
is
a
good
lager
otherwise
it
goes
down
smooth
it
is
easy
to
drink
many
of
these
o
its
a
low
to
mid
level
lager
not
really
craft
in
my
opinion
saranac
has
much
better
options
out
there
its
not
nearly
as
well
put
together
as
say
a
sam
adams
lager
or
brooklyn
lager
i
dont
know
how
it
won
anything
in
the
great
american
beer
fest
but
it
did
considering
how
much
saranac
beers
cost
i
very
seldom
have
too
much
of
a
problem
with
them
and
this
one
is
no
exception
adirondack
lager
is
a
little
too
sweet
and
skewed
toward
the
malty
side
a
little
more
than
i
would
like
but
its
an
easy
drinker
that
i
would
probably
pick
up
again
when
i
see
pints
for
13
overall
definitely
a
beer
i
would
like
to
session
with
often
very
drinkable
but
not
very
memorable
o
definitely
not
a
bad
way
to
spend
a
drinking
session
since
i
have
another
in
the
fridge
ill
probably
tackle
that
at
some
other
point
this
week
notes
not
too
bad
of
a
german
pilsner
and
definatley
drinkable
cheers
overall
considering
i
loved
the
lake
effect
lager
this
variation
from
saranca
was
good
but
not
great
a
pretty
good
beer
overall
this
wasnt
good
as
i
remember
it
which
means
i
should
probably
stop
tasting
for
the
night
my
fifth
so
far
of
a
10pack
variety
pack
grabbed
a
mix
pack
of
six
different
types
of
saranac
i
drank
saranac
regularly
when
going
to
school
in
southern
new
hampshire
about
three
years
ago
but
havent
had
it
since
took
the
top
off
with
lighter
and
it
shot
across
the
room
golden
color
with
a
lot
of
bubbles
running
up
the
side
of
the
grass
and
almost
no
head
nose
is
grainy
sweetness
and
buttery
bread
flavor
is
subdued
compared
to
the
nose
biscuity
but
extremely
light
the
end
has
a
subtle
fruity
hit
but
it
disappears
quickly
that
little
fruity
kick
intrigued
me
to
drink
faster
to
try
and
find
it
more
defined
again
however
it
never
really
stuck
out
finishes
crisp
and
tingly
without
a
lot
of
dryness
a
typical
lager
that
was
on
the
verge
of
making
itself
distinct
my
aggressive
pour
resulted
in
a
foamy
finger
of
dense
eggnogcolored
head
with
good
retention
color
was
a
deep
orangishamber
with
nequality
clarity
bupgoo
nose
had
a
biscuit
malt
sweetness
along
with
a
wheaty
cereal
quality
mouthfeel
was
medium
with
a
slightly
bitter
grassy
tang
to
offset
the
wheatish
sweetness
nice
lacing
began
to
form
throughout
finish
was
semisweet
with
the
grassy
wheaty
taste
lingering
well
after
the
swallow
a
very
pleasant
beer
an
average
pilsner
but
a
very
drinkable
sessionable
beer
pours
a
semiclear
light
amber
color
with
a
1
inch
offwhite
head
that
settles
to
a
small
cap
thin
rings
of
lace
form
on
the
glass
on
the
drink
down
smell
is
of
malt
and
caramel
notes
taste
is
of
toasted
malt
biscuit
and
slight
citrus
zest
very
little
bitterness
quickly
leaves
the
tongue
after
each
sip
there
is
a
crisp
and
clean
mouthfeel
with
a
good
level
of
carbonation
overall
this
is
a
good
lager
and
a
good
choice
to
include
in
the
summer
pack
o
sooo
incredibly
average
not
good
not
bad
i
dont
think
i
have
ever
had
a
beer
this
adequate
in
my
entire
life
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pilsner
glass
the
beer
pours
a
nutorange
color
vibrant
with
a
ton
of
carbonation
bubbles
and
a
chunky
dense
offwhite
head
that
starts
around
three
inches
on
the
pour
and
settles
into
a
thin
disc
layer
of
film
aromas
are
roasty
toasty
with
a
slight
dark
fruit
sweetness
in
there
that
seems
a
bit
out
of
place
the
beer
has
flavors
that
also
have
a
tangy
soursweet
fruit
overtone
maybe
plum
or
grape
that
almost
cover
the
toasted
characteristics
the
toasty
turns
to
burnt
in
the
aftertaste
like
grilling
a
piece
of
fruit
until
it
is
charred
the
finish
is
a
little
dry
with
a
cloying
sweetness
also
unique
for
the
style
with
a
lot
more
flavors
and
characters
than
a
usual
pilsner
not
bad
for
a
little
change
of
pace
d
honestly
im
usually
a
sucker
for
anything
saranac
pumps
out
but
this
one
doesnt
really
wow
me
nice
texture
and
a
generally
pleasant
flavor
but
nothing
especially
impressive
o
not
crazy
about
this
one
probably
wouldnt
drink
again
although
ive
been
lurking
and
reading
ba
for
awhile
this
is
my
first
official
review
i
guess
ive
been
a
bit
gun
shy
probably
shouldve
picked
something
better
out
of
my
cellar
for
my
first
review
notes
not
bad
definitely
inferior
to
sa
boston
lager
brooklyn
lager
or
eliot
ness
with
the
three
excellent
examples
of
vienna
lager
just
mentioned
i
dont
see
a
lot
of
good
reasons
to
buy
this
one
the
beer
is
clear
and
light
copper
in
color
with
a
tiny
head
that
recedes
hastily
leaving
minimal
lacing
the
aroma
is
pretty
weak
emitting
faint
scents
of
sweet
malt
fruit
and
a
general
lager
presence
the
beer
is
sweet
perhaps
a
bit
much
grainy
malty
sweet
with
a
subtle
fruitiness
the
feel
is
thin
to
medium
in
body
with
carbonation
level
lower
than
is
customary
overall
this
is
drinkable
but
i
wouldnt
buy
it
again
d
hmm
the
color
and
smells
make
this
stand
out
from
other
german
pilsners
but
it
is
nice
enough
looks
great
smells
great
tastes
fine
beer
is
medium
in
body
and
a
little
harsh
on
the
finish
the
whole
beer
is
interesting
but
not
driving
there
is
a
little
malt
up
front
but
the
beer
generally
fails
in
my
opinion
to
come
together
as
a
beer
there
is
an
aftertaste
that
really
takes
me
out
of
it
in
the
end
oh
well
try
try
again
12
oz
bottle
from
a
mixed
pack
color
is
a
light
amber
which
is
darker
than
typical
for
this
style
head
is
a
little
fluffy
and
a
little
remains
with
no
lacing
smell
is
subtle
taste
is
very
light
in
a
good
way
and
pleasant
a
lot
smoother
than
many
pilseners
but
not
exactly
an
amber
lager
either
little
bit
of
hops
there
but
mostly
malty
sweetness
if
in
the
mood
for
a
lager
that
is
neither
heavy
nor
light
but
simply
refreshing
this
would
probably
be
a
good
choice
clean
and
unassuming
beer
that
manages
to
strike
a
balance
among
all
the
elements
cheerrrs
o
decent
pilsener
here
but
nothing
exceptional
drinkability
purchased
in
a
mixed
six
pack
in
iowa
while
on
a
trip
not
available
locally
not
something
i
will
actively
seek
out
when
out
travelling
again
even
if
this
were
available
i
dont
think
that
this
would
be
a
regular
purchase
not
a
bad
beer
whatsoever
sweet
easy
to
quaff
but
not
that
crisp
lager
taste
i
was
expecting
and
indeed
would
demand
in
the
summer
months
a
bit
misplaced
but
the
result
is
still
quite
drinkable
taste
is
light
but
clean
slight
bittering
hops
give
way
to
nutty
roasted
malt
taste
with
slight
bread
chewiness
a
good
easy
drinking
beer
but
nothing
to
write
home
about
overall
an
excellent
beer
that
i
would
definetly
buy
in
a
6
for
a
summer
barbecue
overall
nothing
overly
special
about
this
brew
as
microbrews
go
this
is
more
like
a
domestic
beer
a
honeyed
gold
with
amber
hues
light
white
head
and
decent
lacing
smell
is
light
sweet
malt
with
honey
and
mild
peppery
hops
taste
is
much
the
same
with
a
gently
sweet
dough
like
center
a
faint
pear
fruitiness
follows
hops
are
clean
and
spicy
giving
an
excellent
finish
a
whole
grain
cracker
lingers
with
bits
of
biscuit
dough
and
faint
hop
oil
feel
is
effervescent
with
both
quenching
and
refreshing
components
and
a
dry
graininess
weight
is
on
the
lighter
side
of
medium
drinkability
is
quite
good
and
is
a
strong
suit
of
this
one
taste
is
light
creamy
and
a
bit
bitter
with
a
big
iron
taste
i
keep
finding
this
off
flavor
in
their
beers
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
dry
finish
its
an
average
example
of
this
style
at
best
real
good
beer
to
have
with
dinner
and
the
holidays
turkey
dinner
and
a
cold
saranac
for
the
price
this
is
a
decent
lager
drink
ability
is
good
i
could
have
another
one
since
its
light
and
tastes
good
it
a
good
drinker
easy
to
go
down
overall
not
so
good
i
am
not
necessarily
the
biggest
pilsner
fan
but
this
doesnt
taste
like
a
pilsner
it
tastes
like
a
watered
down
boston
lager
its
just
not
that
enjoyable
to
drink
so
i
would
advise
against
it
cheers
d
if
someone
likes
pilseners
and
isnt
too
much
of
a
hophead
then
this
would
be
a
nice
session
beer
id
be
happy
to
drink
this
again
drinks
pretty
good
and
for
the
price
not
too
bad
of
a
choice
but
there
are
so
many
better
pilsners
out
there
i
wont
be
seeking
this
out
again
d
try
it
but
one
was
enough
for
me
tastes
like
a
lager
but
a
better
than
average
one
easy
enough
to
drink
and
refreshing
d
easy
to
quaff
and
an
appealing
finish
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
a
white
head
and
a
bit
of
lacing
the
nose
brings
forward
a
tiny
bit
of
noble
hops
along
with
a
little
bit
of
grain
and
bread
mouthfeel
is
light
with
some
prickly
carbonation
this
isnt
the
best
attempt
at
an
american
version
of
the
style
but
all
around
its
a
fairly
decent
brew
served
with
brat
w
sauerkraut
spicy
brown
on
rye
matched
very
well
and
would
definitely
recommend
to
friends
as
a
good
matching
drinkability
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
the
best
for
its
style
this
beer
isnt
bad
but
is
far
from
special
d
lacks
complexity
boldness
or
distinctiveness
certainly
not
bad
but
disappointing
tastes
like
it
is
about
15
abv
at
times
that
was
the
first
negative
a
little
wood
varnish
at
times
no
hops
some
lemon
and
sugar
just
not
the
makings
or
mouthfeel
of
a
good
beer
and
this
stuff
is
like
7
a
6pack
are
you
kidding
me
drink
a
decent
beer
nothing
spectacular
probably
would
be
good
for
a
session
but
there
are
better
brews
to
seek
out
feels
very
good
and
is
very
drinkable
its
not
the
most
complex
beer
but
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
german
pilsener
its
an
interesting
pilsner
for
sure
with
the
tartness
and
the
comparitively
small
hop
profile
id
rate
it
in
the
average
category
at
best
d
this
strikes
me
as
something
of
a
cross
between
a
pilsner
and
an
american
pale
ale
im
a
fan
of
both
styles
so
it
works
for
me
saranac
adirondack
lagar
pours
with
a
amber
colour
and
a
head
that
pours
nicely
and
never
quite
goes
away
due
to
the
good
carbonation
the
smell
is
hoppy
and
sweet
the
taste
is
warm
and
malty
with
a
smooth
fruity
aftertaste
this
beer
has
presence
in
the
mouth
due
to
the
carbonation
this
beer
was
much
better
than
i
expected
it
was
my
favourite
beer
in
the
mix
pack
final
thoughts
not
much
to
say
but
not
much
to
complain
about
either
would
definitely
recommend
and
would
probably
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
if
i
was
able
to
find
it
this
beer
came
from
a
sampler
6
pack
d
nothing
fancy
just
a
nice
middle
of
the
road
beer
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
sessionable
beer
just
wish
the
taste
was
above
average
mouthfeel
is
rather
dry
in
the
finish
but
this
is
light
and
fairly
drinkable
drinkability
not
overly
impressive
but
a
its
good
enough
to
drink
more
than
one
part
of
the
sampler
twelve
pack
served
in
a
pils
glass
light
yellow
colored

lots
of
carbonation
noticed
at

of
the
glass

a
musty

to
it
taste
was
run
of
the
mill
lager
had
a
bit
of
malt
flavor
with
some
notes
of
leather
and
orange
peel
mouthfeel
was
nothing
special
mostly
just
thin
and
watery
and
bubbly
drinkability
was
decent
as
there
were
no
real
offending
flavors
and
the
body
was
fairly
light
an
average
beer
which
would
make
a
decent
session
beer
but
not
a
great
beer
to
search
for
poured
into
a
pint
glass
an
attractive
cloudy
orange
with
a
one
finger
head
and
little
retention
sweet
malty
smell
of
citrus
fruits
along
with
spicy
clove
aromas
bitter
hoppy
taste
with
hints
of
lemonlime
medium
body
big
carbonation
dry
finish
decent
aftertaste
overall
an
acceptable
beer
to
try
in
a
saranac
trail
mix
sampler
but
by
no
means
worthy
of
purchasing
a
whole
sixer
d
i
will
gladly
have
another
during
any
season
it
has
a
good
balance
and
is
appropriate
year
round
drink
with
a
good
heavy
meat
and
potatoes
meal
or
with
a
hearty
soup
d
this
is
a
full
flavored
beer
that
has
great
drinkability
this
is
a
sessionable
beer
t
quite
well
balanced
but
hops
and
bitterness
lose
out
in
the
end
there
is
lots
of
bready
malts
going
on
with
just
a
slight
bite
from
flowery
hops
d
the
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
refreshingtheres
nothing
particularly
special
about
the
flavors
but
its
a
great
way
to
open
up
your
palate
nothing
bad
here
and
to
some
extent
it
has
some
distinctive
pieces
im
just
not
comftorable
with
them
t
drinkable
yes
forgettable
yep
a
middle
of

overall
impression
could
stand
a
fair
amount
of
tweaking

recommended
nice
carbonation

a
moderately
viscous
feel
go
down
somewhat

by

with

a
very
nicely

though
more

deceptive

a
better
beer
than
you
might
expect
though
not
in
a
class
with
the
top
lagers
still
a
perfectly
acceptable
bottle
of
beer
d
i
think
that
for
a
cheap
pilsener
this
is
pretty
good
not
worth
going
out
of
your
way
for
but
definitely
get
it
if
you
need
something
cheap
and
there
aint
much
else
out
there
d
this
is
pretty
sweet
pilsener
and
goes
down
pretty
smooth
but
i
could
see
the
sweetness
and
tanginess
getting
tiresome
after
a
few
of
these
beers
id
probably
have
one
more
but
not
much
more
after
that
pours
a
very
clear
golden
orangelight
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
white
head
decent
retension
and
a
little

of
lacing
is
noted
on
the
glass
nose
of
this
beer
is
a
little
grainy
malty
sweet
slight
note
of
hops
and
a
bit
of
butter
taste
is
malty
sweet
upfront
with
some
buttery
notes
and
a
slight
touch
of
hops
towards
the
end
mostly
a
grainy
taste
throughout
the
medium
body
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
it
has
quite
a
crisp
finish
but
with
a
bit
of
a
grainy
sweetness
left
lingering
in
the
mouth
that
clashes
with
the
hop
bitterness
overall
not
bad
notbad
lager
fuller
in
body
than
your
typical
pilsner
a
bit
unbalanced
toward
the
malt
side
but
while
average
still
good
for
saranac
overall
this
is
a
nice
beer
even
tho
it
is
not
100
representative
of
its
classification
almost
too
sweet
for
this
style
d
refreshing
and
drinkable
would
like
to
try
on
tap
honeyed
amber
with
a
creamy
eggshell
colored
head
that
leaves
fine
patchy
lace
on
the
glass
sweet
malt
and
a
good
whiff
of
floral
hops
nice
sweet
maltiness
with
plenty
of
oily
hop
flavors
and
faint
notes
of
tobacco
medium
full
bodied
with
good
carbonation
a
little
bit
strange
but
good
a
pleasant
surprise
from
mbc
a
medium
bodied
lager
heavier
than
most
pale
lagers
went
down
smooth
enough
d
the
malt
body
of
this
beer
is
its
most
distinguishing
feature
despite
the
dryness
of
the
finish
there
is
a
toasted
malt
note
that
lingers
in
the
aftertaste
with
a
thick
grainy
quality
unfortunately
the
dryness
brings
out
some
burnt
character
in
the
toast
and
the
base
malt
does
not
impart
the
refined
honey
notes
that
you
get
from
good
quality
pilsner
the
hops
have
a
musty
somewhat
british
quality
that
some
might
enjoy
but
it
does
not
appeal
to
me
overall
this
is
a
decent
lager
but
not
one
i
would
drink
again
d
a
decent
pils
but
theres
something
just
not
quite
right
with
it
a
little
bit
off
got
this
in
an
adirondack
trail
mix
sixer
the
good
things
about
this
beer
is
that
the
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
crisp
and
the
taste
and
nose
are
balanced
but
with
a
little
more
hoppiness
however
the
beer
looks
like
an
adjunct
lager
and
overall
its
ok
but
it
just
does
not
impress
me
that
much
would
drink
again
im
not
huge
into
lagers
although
there
are
quite
a
few
i
definitely
love
i
get
more
excited
about
ales
but
the
floral
presence
in
this
one
makes
it
a
keeper
smell
reminds
me
of
a
nice
scotch
ale
not
in
taste
though
minus
the
alcohol
very
nice
drinkability
a
great
pilsner
and
a
great
lager
crisp
clean
and
refreshing
i
could
drink
these
all
day
give
it
a
shot
pours
copper
with
about
an
inch
of
head
that
retains
pretty
well
floral
hops
are
present
in
the
smell
like
chrysanthemum
and
a
bit
of
honey
and
some
earthy
aromas
too
taste
seems
a
little
more
bitter
than
the
average
pils
though
it
is
nice
and
has
a
good
mouthfeel
a
bit
on
the
heavy
side
but
also
pretty
crisp
from
the
carbonation
definitely
drinkable
though
not
transcendent
floral
hops
fill
the
aroma
along
with
a
little
bit
of
malt
flavor
is
light
and
well
balanced
a
little
bit
of
sulphur
but
its
crisp
and
refreshing
carbonation
is
high
and
its
certainly
drinkable
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
a
pils
not
bad
somewhere
inbetween
dos
equis
and
sam
adams
maybe
leaning
closer
to
dos
equis
the
taste
is
weird
very
harsh
and
bitter
at
first
taste
then
finishes
sweet
with
slight
mangolemon
flavor
but
also
a
bitter
flavor
like
eating
the
orange
peel
not
a
great
tasting
beer
at
all
i
will
not
be
buying
this
particular
saranac
beer
again
i
usually
agree
with
the
overall
consensus
here
on
ba
but
with
this
one
i
think
the
ratings
are
a
bit
harsh
i
live
quite
close
to
the
brewery
and
this
is
a
great
reasonably
priced
lager
poured
from
a
brown
12
oz
bottle
has
a
brown
color
with
a
12
inch
head
smell
is
slightly
sweet
malts
with
some
hops
taste
is
primarily
of
hops
some
malts
feels
medium
bodied
in
the
mouth
and
has
average
drinkability
overall
this
makes
for
a
decent
beer
d
excellent
i
cant
wait
to
get
my
hands
on
more
of
this
stuff
i
must
say
this
was
totally
unexpected
to
get
a
perfect
5
out
of
a
mixed
six
pack
of
saranac
wow
an
awesome
overall
beer
d
a
wonderfully
drinkable
lager
from
saranac
a
relaxing
stressfree
beer
pours
with
a
bright
clear
bronze
color
and
a
thick
off
white
cap
of
foam
the
head
dissapears
pretty
quickly
and
does
not
leave
much
lacing
the
smell
is
mild
with
some
malt
and
a
faint
whif
of
hops
the
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
a
nice
level
of
carbonation
the
initial
taste
is
the
mild
sweetness
of
lightly
toasted
malt
followed
by
some
strange
metallic
flavor
i
detected
some
whiskey
like
notes
as
well
the
finish
is
all
spicy
hops
and
even
a
little
alchohol
flavor
this
beer
strikes
me
as
a
poor
mans
sa
boston
lager
my
impression
is
that
they
were
striving
to
create
a
clone
but
ended
up
with
something
not
quite
as
smooth
refined
and
tasty
as
the
sabl
overall
a
drinkable
beer
but
something
that
i
would
order
only
if
budmillercoors
was
the
only
other
option
at
the
time
d
goes
down
smooth
no
bad
aftertastes
or
anything
either
in
conclusion
this
was
a
very
enjoyable
beer
makes
me
wish
i
could
find
more
of
there
beer
in
my
area
i
poured
into
a
pint
glass
to
an
inch
of
fluffy
head
it
is
a
golden
amber
color
it
smells
fresh
sweet
malts
it
has
a
bit
of
the
miller
lite
skunky
taste
but
it
is
better
than
that
crap
im
not
really
diggin
this
beer
maybe
it
would
taste
better
after
noon

its
not

for

the

way
over

a

american
lager
taste
actually
liked
its
thin
drinkability
and
think
it
has
the
makings
for
a
new
stellar
session
beer
additionally
for
those
who
havent
been
if
youre
in
the
upstate
ny
region
the

one
i
tried
out
of

three
this
one
comes
in
second
a
drinkable

yet
nothing
special
at
all

that
looks
very
appealing
smells
of
sweet
carmelly
malts
floral
hops
medium
bodied
beer
that
tastes
pretty
simple
and
straightforward
of
honeyish
and
lightly
toasty
malts
with
an
almost
oily
hoppiness
in
my
opinion
this
is
one
of
saranacs
better
beers
this
isnt
my
favorite
beer
but
on
terms
of
style
this
beer
is
excellent
probably
one
of
the
best
you
can
get
for
this
price
a
great
beer
great
mouthfeel
on
this
one
very
creamy
and
smooth
not
watery
like
some
brews
of
this
style
are
some
slight
hop
bite
to
this
its
faint
but
its
there
malt
is
the
main
player
but
not
overly
so
this
is
a
really
welldone
beer
in
my
mind
this
would
be
my
new
session
lager
if
i
could
find
it
in
a
6pack
here
recommend
out
of
a
bottle
this
beer
was
an
orangeamber
color
with
a
short
lived
head
the
lacing
was
pretty
good
however
given
the
poor
retention
the
aroma
was
slightly
sour
and
a
mix
of
classic
lager
malt
some
hop
bitterness
and
a
bit
of
dry
yeast
the
flavors
were
balanced
opening
with
a
hoppy
bitterness
a
doughy
malt
middle
that
then
proceeds
to
a
floral
hop
finish
the
body
was
medium
the
mouthfeel
smooth
and
the
carbonation
mediumhigh
a
pretty
good
lager
and
one
of
the
better
saranac
offering
the
adirondack
lager
is
definitely
best
great
pour
and
color
with
a
powerful
flavorful
taste
a
must
try
m
crisp
and
biting
but
enjoyable
poured
to
a
half
finger
head
and
quickly
dissolved
to
a
small
ring
around
the
grace
little
to
no
lacing
the
color
was
more
of
an
orangishred
than
the
yellow
straw
of
a
pilsner
very
little
aroma
from
the
glass
a
very
plain
flavor
maybe
because
a
pilsner
is
what
most
of
the
big
companies
sell
bud
miller
that
i
found
this
to
be
a
rather
ordinary
flavor
something
you
could
give
a
bud
drinker
and
they
would
take
to
it
not
much
in
terms
of
hops
or
malt
flavor
it
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
this
is
one
of
the
saranac
beers
that
may
be
too
balanced
nothing
distinctive
about
it
copper
colored
with
a
big
foamy
head
that
is
gone
in
seconds
some
lacing
around
on
the
glass
but
no
retention
smell
is
corn
and
malty
maybe
a
touch
of
hops
in
there
somewhere
too
taste
is
sweet
up
front
and
then
dries
in
the
finish
little
hops
present

drinkability
is
fine
this
is
a
pretty
good
lager
when
i
saw
it
listed
as
a
pilsner
i
got
confused
good
beer
from
saranac
one
of
my
favorites
pretty
refreshing
and
easy
drinking
not
something
id
seek
out
very
often
but
a
light
easy
drinking
brew
mouth
feel
is
fairly
light
drinkability
is
fine
and
driven
by
its
lightness
not
its
creativeness

d
beats
the
pants
off
a
shit
macro
but
thats
about
all
i
can
say
d
overall
a
dry
and
spicy
lager
pretty
big
on
flavor
with
a
nice
toasted
malting
wouldnt
consider
this
a
session
lager
but
big
on
flavor
and
one
of
their
better
beers
by
far
worth
a
try
d
sure
its
easy
to
drink
but
there
are
macro
lagers
out
there
that
and
more
delicious
than
this
and
thats
saying
something
average
at
best
drinkability
fantastic
another
fine
session
beer
from
saranac
the
first
time
i
had
this
beer
i
thought
it
tasted
no
different
than
an
exaggerated
budweiser
the
second
time
i
bought
a
mixed
12
pack
and
i
had
it
again
i
had
a
much
better
feeling
about
it
this
is
one
thirst
quencher
having
a
great
drinkability
and
mouthfeel
due
to
it
being
a
pilsener
the
appearance
and
aroma
may
not
be
the
best
but
if
im
thirsty
on
a
hot
day
id
reach
for
this
the
feel
is
not
watery
at
all
in
fact
it
gives
the
consistency
of
a
slightly
creamy
ale
its
a
very
good
lager
perfect
combo
of
thirstquenching
but
not
thin
or
watery
d
very
drinkable
easy
to
sip
on
no
overpowering
flavors
but
not
tasteless
if
i
had
more
than
one
id
keep
drinking
them
golden
amber
color
that
pours
a
decent
white
head
just
some
light
lacing
a
sweet
malty
taste
to
it
not
the
greatest
taste
or
smell
to
it
though
it
seemed
a
bit
caramel
scotchy
and
overall
a
bit
weird
i
like
saranacs
pale
ale
more
than
this
one
drinkability
not
wretched
not
great
donce
again
there
is
a
certain
underlying
theme
in
the
saranac
brews
a
taste
i
cant
quite
put
my
finger
on
this
is
quite
an
average
lager
one
that
to
me
does
not
really
shout
german
pils
still
it
is
drinkable
and
i
could
see
myself
having
a
couple
of
these
as
a
side
note
this
is
much
more
of
a
lightbodied
amber
than
a
classic
german
pilsener
light
and
refreshing
but
nothing
that
grabs
my
attention
still
a
good
beer
on
a
hot
summer
night
drinkability
here
is
average
id
get
this
in
a
6
pack
or
something
but
theres
better
out
there
this
is
a
decent
average
beer
golden
color
with
nice
hoppy
aroma
it
has
a
decently
malty
taste
with
a
strong
hop
bitter
i
am
a
hop
head
but
a
nice
malty
lager
is
appreciated
the
mouthfeel
is
ok
a
little
on
the
light
side
it
is
a
good
beer
for
a
hot
day
this
is
a
good
run
of
the
mill
beer
pours
a
very
light
amberdark
gold
with
very
little
head
and
leaves
no
lacing
around
the
glass
aroma
is
weak
found
it
hard
to
pick
up
any
flavors
at
all
thin
mouthfeel
that
finishes
awkwardly
the
flavor
is
the
only
quality
of
this
beer
that
i
found
to
be
worthwhile
sweet
malts
are
tucked
away
and
lead
into
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
overall
the
flavor
is
just
above
average
in
my
opinion
but
is
weak
compared
to
other
viennaamber
style
lagers
this
beer
needs
more
body
and
a
richer
flavor
all
in
all
i
was
not
impressed
12oz
bottle
poured
into
a
pint
glass
pours
a
really
nice
looking
copper
color
with
a
creamy
offwhite
head
that
does
a
pretty
good
job
with
lacing
and
retention
the
aroma
is
sweet
malt
and
caramel
with
some
hops
the
taste
begins
with
a
smooth
malty
flavor
with
the
hops
providing
for
a
mildly
bitter
finish
the
mouthfeel
has
a
nice
smooth
and
creamy
body
that
i
enjoyed
overall
saranac
adirondack
lager
is
not
a
bad
lager
but
nothing
that
i
would
purchase
again
clear
light
copperamber
colored
with
pretty
good
fluffy
whit
head
smell
is
of
slightly
taostedgrainy
malts
and
a
little
grassyprickly
hop
as
well
taste
is
of
some
sweet
malt
and
a
little
hop
bitterness
on
the
finish
mouth
feel
is
average
however
drinkability
is
very
good
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
white
rocky
head
that
fades
to
lacing
rather
quickly
has
a
nice
malty
aroma
with
some
lager
esters
not
as
much
malt
on
the
flavor
and
a
bit
of
citrus
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
a
load
of
carbonation
nice
drinkable
lager
good
for
the
warm
weather
d
this
has
pretty
good
drinkability
it
does
not
taste
great
but
is
easy
drinking
and
refreshing
would
make
a
god
choice
on
a
hot
afternoon
when
you
want
something
with
a
mild
flavor
profile
drinkability
pretty
straightforward
and
forgettable
but
an
easy
drinker
id
pick
up
another
variety
if
i
had
no
idea
what
i
wanted
pours
a
deep
yellow
amber
color
with
a
nice
off
white
head
the
aroma
is
a
bit
like
biscuit
and
malt
the
flavor
isnt
impressiveslight
german
lager
yeast
taste
but
other
than
that
close
to
nothing
not
as
dry
as
i
would
expectresidual
sweetness
is
left
in
the
mouth
after
tasting
not
too
hard
to
drink
a
few
of
these
but
not
pleaseant
enough
to
have
a
lot
not
a
bad
beer
has
a
good
drinkability
but
id
stick
to
saranacs
ales
my
first
sip
is
disappointing
after
a
review
of
this
sites
description
of
a
german
pilsener
i
cant
seem
to
get
a
lot
of
hopiness
out
of
it
but
after
trying
about
13
of
the
glass
some
of
the
hops
do
now
come
to
my
taste
buds
but
they
dont
seem
to
really
do
much
the
beer
now
tastes
pretty
good
and
is
refreshing
after
a
hot
day
some
of
the
citruslike
flavors
are
coming
though
i
find
myself
warming
up
to
this
beer
the
more
i
have
it
not
much
of
an
aftertaste
i
could
have
more
then
one
on
the
patio
and
with
friends
not
bad
decent
enough
but
im
an
ale
man
this
has
a
decent
flavor
but
it
just
doesnt
compare
to
what
else
is
out
there
its
like
it
wasnt
balanced
properly
and
i
guess
itll
take
some
getting
used
to
ill
skip
it
next
time
d
notes
ok
drinkability
needed
better

12
oz
part

pours
a
great
light
amber
color
with
excellent
head
and
nice
lacing
it
has
a
very
nice
clean
crisp
scent
very
sweet
and
sugary
with
hints
of
maltiness
great
taste
a
very
sweet
beer
going
down
with
a
nice
spicy
hop
taste
after
goes
down
well
if
a
bit
overcarbonated
excellent
stuff
drinkability
basic
but
drinkable
at
best
lackluster
and
a
waste
of
time
at
worst
pass
me
an
eliot
ness
this
beer
had
a
solid
showing
in
all
of
the
categories
lovely
ambergolden
color
excellent
head
carbonated
just
right
smell
is
a
blend
of
hops
and
malt
tastes
nice
with
just
the
right
amount
of
kick
from
the
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
and
clear
with
a
bit
of
fizziness
drinkability
obviously
is
excellent
id
go
and
buy
a
sixer
of
this
when
i
wanted
to
drink
some
more
smooth
and
light
bodied
with
fine
carbonation
excellent
drinkability
basically
this
is
the
beer
that
american
macro
lagers
want
to
be
it
is
nice
inoffensive
and
easy
to
drink
chug
even
but
there
is
nothing
special
about
it
where
is
the
magic
it
simply
isnt
there
d
everything
about
this
brew
screams
drink
me
but
theres
something
about
it
that
i
dont
enjoy
maybe
its
the
high
carbonation
or
the
two
dimensional
flavor
its
light
but
not
its
clean
but
somehow
not
somethings
out
of
balance
with
this
beer
giving
it
mediocre
drinkability
at
best
adirondack
lager
pours
a
clean
and
clear

a
big
foamy
head
the

patters
on
the

white
bread
and
lightly
toasted
malts
mix
with

in

sweet

and
toasty
malts

buy
some
hop
bitterness
that
leads
into
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
the
carbonation
is
mellow
with
a
medium
body
and
a
smooth
mouth
feel
this
is
a
very
good
vienna
style
lager
and
a
must
have
when
i
go
camping
in
the
adirondacks
is
it
worth
7
49
a
sixpack
some
saranac
beers
are
but
im
not
sure
this
one
is
over
all
pretty
much
an
avarage
beer
poured
a
copper
bronze
color
with
amber
hues
nice
thick
head
held
up
with
good
lacing
aroma
was
a
bit
weaker
but
very
clean
and
a
little
spicy
taste
begins
with
a
sweet
caramel
maltiness
but
is
soon
evened
out
by
the
yeasty
precense
in
the
body
hops
come
out
towards
the
end
and
provide
a
slightly
spicy
and
dry
finish
average
across
the
board
poured
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
chimay
chalice
pours
a
golden
straw
with
a
big
white
head
that
disappeared
into
nothingness
and
left
no
lacing
the
aroma
is
slightly
musty
with
hints
of
hops
and
just
a
slight
buttery
aroma
the
taste
is
pretty
average
there
are
slight
notes
of
green
apples
and
just
a
bit
of
bitterness
at
the
end
the
mouthfeel
is
light
and
highly
carbonated
this
is
a
good
lawnmower
beer
not
much
to
say
about
this
beer
other
than
kind
of
ordinary
amber
color
thick
white
sticky
head
very
little
aroma
just
a
little
bit
of
malt
same
with
the
taste
just
a
little
bit
of
malt
with
the
tiniest
bit
of
hops
an
inoffensive
beer
nothing
to
write
home
about
d
this
is
a
mixed
bag
of
a
beer
it
has
its
good
points
but
ultimately
its
not
complex
enough
in
the
taste
department
d
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
but
a
very
drinkable
brew
good
sessionable
beer
without
any
overwhelming
aspects
that
would
leave
your
tongue
fatigued
drinkability
goes
down
smooth
seems
wellcrafted
almost
average
though
nothing
to
really
make
it
stand
out
great
lawn
mower
beer
though
a
semicreamy
pinky
finger
head
that
died
almost
as
it
was
born
some
good
carbonation
though
on
top
of
a
mixed
dark
goldreddish
body
and
a
little
bit
of
lacings
a
slightly
citric
hoppy
smell
dominates
with
faint
malts
in
the
background
of
the
beers
aroma
a
matly
presence
is
noticeable
something
like
coffee
or
toasted
mixed
in
with
the
earthy
hops
this
creates
a
medium
body
that
has
a
semisweet
there
is
a
tad
bit
of
citrus
to
taste
taste
but
a
finish
that
is
a
little
too
dry
for
my
liking
no
big
payoff
in
the
dry
backbite
an
alright
beer
and
id
recommend
trying
it
but
not
my
first
choice
at
all
notes
i
find
this
beer
easily
and
very
well
pricedbut
this
beer
is
not
true
to
its
style
yet
despite
this
i
find
it
a
good
beer
to
have
before
i
get
serious
and
sip
on
some
world
class
brew
very
light
on
hops
but
well
balanced
and
a
beautiful
color
d
enjoyable
for
its
uniqueness
if
nothing
else
not
a
bad
brew
and
one
i
wouldnt
mind
revisiting
worth
trying
this
is
a
good
beer
with
some
body
but
definitely
drinkable
love
most
of
the
beers
in
this
sample
pack
any
time
of
year
very
pale
transluscent
amber
with
a
small
white
head
smell
is
a
touch
metallic
and
lager
yeast
mostly
with
a
bit
of
malt
taste
is
fairly
standard
light
malt
with
a
pleasant
slight
touch
of
tartness
and
a
hint
of
yeast
mild
to
medium
bitterness
in
the
finish
somewhat
thin
flavored
but
medium
body
that
is
crisp
and
clean
not
bad
at
all
but
doesnt
stand
out
too
much
still
an
enjoyable
unoffensive
easy
drinking
beer
thanks
dave
d
refreshing
but
a
little
more
more
hoppy
and
bitter
than
i
expect
from
a
lager
this
beer
strikes
me
more
as
a
vienna
lager
than
a
pilsner
but
whatever
this
beer
seems
to
be
just
about
the
perfect
craft
beer
gateway
brew
it
reminds
me
of
dos
equis
with
a
dash
more
character
it
features
some
wonderful
noble
hop
character
with
a
very
clean
finish
that
makes
you
want
more
and
more
d
id
select
this
at
a
bar
on
tap
against
any
macro
anyday
i
often
rotate
back
and
forth
between
this
and
sam
adams
at
bars
with
moderate
selection
they
complement
eachother
well
and
are
highly
drinkable
d
a
decent
effort
but
a
little
unusual
tasting
if
i
were
going
for
an
easytofind
midpriced
pack
in
the
grocery
store
i
would
likely
lean
more
towards
sam
adams
or
magic
hat
it
would
be
a
maybe
on
getting
another
one
of
these
i
think
very
nice
looking
amber
in
color
formed
a
decent
white
head
smell
very
malty
not
much
hops
taste
not
bad
a
little
bitterness
up
front
lots
of
malt
a
little
nutty
mouthfeel
mediem
in
body
and
carbonation
drinkability
was
ok
its
not
the
greatest
beer
in
the
world
but
i
could
have
a
few
mouthfeel
and
drinkability
this
one
is
medium
in
the
mouth
actually
i
find
it
heavier
than
most
other
pils
this
is
an
extremely
drinkable
beer
just
about
appeals
to
everyone
i
should
say
not
necessarily
one
id
pick
up
again
but
still
if
im
in
the
mood
for
a
german
pils
this
might
be
the
one
i
pick
up
if
i
cant
get
my
hands
on
victorys
prima
pils
overall
there
really
wasnt
much
i
liked
about
this
one
pours
a
clear
amber
very
small
head
that
quickly
leaves
nose
is
like
a
mix
of
leaves
and
sugar
in
a
baked
sense
i
would
say
overall
not
much
to
it
flavor
is
almost
acidic
with
its
bitter
tone
at
first
then
it
calms
and
gets
into
more
of
a
earthy
and
slightly
dirty
lager
profile
i
mean
to
me
there
just
isnt
anything
that
distinctive
about
it
feel
is
decent
drinkability
is
on
the
same
level
it
is
just
a
standard
old
lager
really
it
has
a
nice
body
to
it
sure
but
there
just
isnt
anything
exciting
about
it
at
all
lingering
bitterness
might
cut
down
on
drinkability
but
otherwise
a
somewhat
more
interesting
lager
than
the
big
boys
produce
this
beer
poured
an
amber
color
with
a
big
fluffy
fourfinger
head
the
smell
is
a
pleasant
bready
maltiness
with
a
hint
of
floral
hops
the
taste
starts
off
with
some
sweet
maltiness
that
is
quickly
cut
by
a
couple
different
kinds
of
hop
bitterness
the
mouthfeel
is
average
with
a
middling
amount
of
carbonation
id
consider
this
to
be
a
very
drinkable
lager
that
i
could
see
myself
knocking
back
a
couple
of
another
sample
from
the
sample
pack
the
appearance
was
great
murky
and
golden
with
a
foamy
head
that
thins
out
slowly
the
smell
was
thin
was
satisfying
to
the
senses
hops
with
balanced
malts
give
it
a
bitterish
aroma
the
taste
is
surprisingly
sweet
that
is
wonderfully
thin
from
the
mouthfeel
it
is
definitely
a
refreshing
smooth
taste
with
great
lager
balances
over
all
its
flavors
this
is
another
great
one
from
saranac
d
i
really
dont
like
this
ive
also
got
a
bone
to
pick
with
the
style
that
this
is
listed
under
german
pils
no
way
i
think
that
this
is
more
of
a
vienna
lager
than
anything
i
can
see
myself
picking
this
one
up
if
i
were
in
the
mood
its
a
little
too
malty
but
a
tasty
and
cheap
craft
brew
i
enjoyed
this
beer
better
than
that
other
macro
lager
yuengling
the
beer
is
the
perfect
complement
to
a
summer
bbq
despite
its
light
mouthfeel
the
beer
is
surprisingly
heavy
one
or
two
compliments
a
meal
nicely
this
was
2
from
their
sampler
pack
pours
a
clear
light
orange
color
w
a
light
offwhite
head
which
dissapates
quickly
little
lacing
a
strong
hop
aroma
w
slight
less
malt
than
boasted
the
hop
flavor
hits
you
right
away
really
overpowers
the
malts
nice
med
body
though
with
a
dextinous
finish
not
what
youd
expect
considering
the
lack
of
malt
flavor
actually
needs
to
be
a
bit
drier
for
a
pils
not
an
undrinkable
though
id
drink
a
few
of
these
during
a
hockey
game
or
something
tastes
rather
simple
like
the
nose
has
a
bready
malt
taste
and
light
citric
hop
taste
i
could
enjoy
this
one
after
a
hike
or
at
camp
this
poured
a
beautiful
amber
color
with
abundant
lacing
smell
is
a
nice
malt
and
hop
aroma
hops
are
subtle
in
the
flavor
mostly
dominated
by
malty
goodness
this
beer
is
incredibly
refreshing
and
drinkable
this
is
my
second
from
this
brewer
and
so
far
im
rather
impressed
my
next
trip
down
will
definitely
consist
of
some
of
this
again
the
taste
mostly
consists
of
a
light
caramel
flavor
with
only
a
touch
of
hop
presence
its
pretty
much
just
a
dark
allmalt
lager
thin
bodied
with
good
carbonation
the
finish
has
a
candylike
feel
mostly
clear
slight
chill
haze
light
coppery
amber
body
topped
by
a
thin
cap
of
light
beige
foam
that
fell
quickly
to
a
thick
ring
fine
lacing
showed
a
little
stickage
fruity
aroma
seems
to
be
from
the
yeast
a
little
malt
sweetness
with
pleasantly
floral
hop
nose
low
bitterness
fairly
fruity
with
a
hint
of
hop
spice
in
the
finish
light
bodied
moderate
carbonation
just
short
of
crisp
with
a
consistent
texture
throughout
pretty
tasty
overall
the
flavour
in
the
finish
is
just
a
little
off
though
sort
of
reminds
me
of
the
bitterness
you
get
from
a
very
weak
spice
tea
thats
intended
for
a
different
beer
pours
a
nice
golden
amber
with
a
thick
frothy
white
head
the
head
dissipates
after
the
first
sip
the
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
faint
hop
aroma
this
is
a
very
inviting
beer
the
taste
starts
sweet
with
the
malty
tones
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
but
leaves
the
sweetness
lingering
on
your
tongue
the
taste
is
somewhat
subtle
built
for
the
summer
and
it
is
very
refreshing
this
one
is
in
between
a
medium
and
light
mouthfeel
leaning
more
towards
light
the
carbonation
is
good
and
is
a
very
easy
drinker
would
match
up
with
just
about
any
food
a
great
summer
lager
but
it
could
be
enjoyed
any
time
this
one
is
worth
checking
out
for
the
lager
fans
out
there
no
surprises
here
just
a
quality
lager
d
a
fine
session
ale
but
not
something
id
jump
at
there
is
a
nice
malt
flavor
on
first
taste
with
a
bit
of
caramellike
sweetness
to
it
but
not
overly
so
there
were
hints
of
fruit
here
as
well
although
they
didnt
really
dominate
in
any
way
but
had
to
be
looked
for
somewhat
this
is
balanced
nicely
with
the
hop
flavor
which
comes
out
especially
on
the
finish
carbonation
level
is
good
not
so
high
that
its
fizzy
and
a
nice
accent
to
the
hopinduced
bitterness
especially
in
the
finish
its
definitely
a
mediumbodied
beer
a
bit
richer
in
flavor
than
many
of
the
lighter
summer
brews
d
this
beer
is
refreshing
and
it
has
some
character
i
would
definitely
drink
a
few
if
thats
what
i
have
available
but
im
not
sure
that
id
buy
this
by
the
6
pack
or
more
either
so
this
is
the
second
bottle
from
my
mixed
saranac
pack
well
actually
the
third
but
i
have
had
the
ipa
before
so
i
will
not
be
reviewing
it
again
i
have
been
having
a
thing
for
lagers
lately
so
i
am
hoping
this
one
does
not
let
me
down
poured
a
very
nice
crystal
clear
amber
nice
orange
hugh
for
a
lager
two
inch
white
head
faded
quickly
to
just
that
quarter
inch
layer
of
film
on
the
top
very
decent
lacing
for
a
lager
as
well
was
dripping
down
the
sides
i
could
see
some
nice
visible
carbonation
streaming
up
off
the
bottom
of
the
glass
clarity
excellent
overall
look
a
ok
smell
was
lots
of
bready
yeast
smells
lots
of
grain
kind
of
a
moldy
or
off
earthy
aroma
like
grass
stuck
in
mud
or
bread
batter
a
slight
hint
of
hoppiness
in
the
back
as
well
the
taste
was
pretty
standard
at
first
however
as
it
warmed
i
detected
a
nice
earthy
grain
mixed
with
almost
a
banana
tone
a
decent
dry
hoppy
finish
as
wellthe
feel
was
great
light
and
remarkable
smooth
great
carbonation
not
slick
oily
or
otherwise
detrimental
at
all
superb
drinkabilty
this
is
an
easy
session
beer
has
such
as
nice
light
profile
yet
great
taste
not
watered
down
like
some
other
lagers
easily
a
hot
weather
drinker
overall
i
really
liked
this
and
thought
it
was
much
better
then
the
pale
ale
and
would
actually
order
or
buy
this
one
again
looking
forward
to
the
next
one
in
the
box
the
blak
and
tan
this
beer
sports
a
nice
amber
color
while
the
aroma
is
malty
a
little
earthy
but
mostly
sweet
the
taste
is
all
over
the
place
theres
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
but
it
just
sort
of
alternates
with
the
sweet
malty
character
which
reminds
me
of
a
peach
jelly
or
marmalade
smooth
and
refreshing
but
a
bit
unbalanced
though
that
does
nothing
to
hinder
the
drinkability
of
this
beer
its
a
solid
brew
but
i
have
had
better
d
pretty
tasty
with
a
classic
noble
hop
aroma
and
flavor
that
complements
a
nice
bready
maltiness
a
really
good
example
of
the
bohemian
pilsner
style
4
0
overall
this
is
a
very
interesting
beer
and
somewhat
confusing
while
i
can
appreciate
that
its
hard
to
define
stylistically
i
dont
think
its
very
strong
in
any
particular
direction
that
said
i
find
it
interesting
and
refreshing
but
not
very
special
the
saranac
brand
has
so
many
other
offerings
that
are
much
more
interesting
drinkability
a
not
so
filling
somewhat
tasteful
beer
i
would
have
no
problem
putting
a
couple
of
these
down
though
they
would
not
be
my
first
choice
overall
not
a
bad
beer
just
something
is
a
little
off
that
prevents
it
from
being
a
good
beer
d
not
something
i
would
relish
sessioning
as
the
taste
just
wasnt
on
drinkability
well
when
it
comes
down
to
it
it
does
matter
how
good
a
beer
looks
or
smells
if
it
tastes
bad
this
one
is
average
in
all
categories
but
taste
and
tatse
kills
it
not
for
me
the
rest
follows
the
former
its
not
bad
but
not
great
12
oz
bottle
on
a
lager
friday
tawny
to
a
transparence
pasty
headed
slightly
metallic
odor
side
tongue
and
back
of
mouth
experience
is
souring
and
leaves
me
feeling
simple
the
beer
was
here
and
gone
leaving
little
to
report
bring
on
the
barbeques
it
pours
a
clear
light
brown
with
yellowish
tones
the
thin
head
dissipates
fairly
quickly
and
barely
laces
it
smells
like
a
rich
lager
caramel
malts
slight
hops
and
that
weird
yeast
that
i
cant
get
used
to
i
like
lagers
that
dont
have
that
scent
to
them
but
i
know
that
a
lot
of
the
better
german
lagers
smell
like
that
kind
of
bitter
for
the
style
balances
out
the
sweet
malt
as
i
said
not
my
thing
but
a
decent
example
of
the
style
creamy
mouthfeel
medium
body
and
if
this
beer
appealed
to
you
i
imagine
youd
like
to
drink
it
all
night
im
glad
i
had
someone
to
split
it
with
and
i
moved
onto
their
pale
ale
what
do
you
think
d
this
is
one
damn
drinkable
brew
not
as
complex
as
many
others
but
a
first
rate
representation
of
what
the
style
should
be
poured
pale
amber
with
a
nice
white
head
aroma
is
very
faint
mostly
malt
taste
is
mild
and
light
malts
and
then
a
little
hops
on
the
finish
this
stuff
reminds
me
of
yuengling
only
better
a
little
fuller
easygoing
nothing
earthshaking
but
much
better
than
macro
and
reasonablypriced
at
least
in
upstateny
it
is
poured
nicely
with
good
color
and
head
retention
good
lacing
and
a
very
nice
hop
aroma
clean
crispness
which
unfortunately
doesnt
translate
to
the
taste
very
dry
on
the
tongue
almost
grainy
with
a
watery
essence
of
cardboard
flavor
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
is
its
only
saving
grace
as
the
malts
are
too
faint
and
watered
down
to
compete
with
the
other
odd
flavors
light
bodied
the
usual
pleasing
malts
in
amber
lagers
are
missing
and
replaced
with
some
strange
tongue
twisting
flavors
poured
from
a
12oz
bottle
into
my
shaker
pint
glass
appears
a
clear
golden
amber
color
with
a
finger
of
off
white
head
minimal
lacing
left
on
the
glass
smells
of
sweet
malt
apples
grapes
and
a
touch
of
citrus
tastes
of
bittersweet
grassy
hops
with
a
great
malt
presence
to
match
finish
is
dry
and
slightly
sour
medium
in
both
body
and
carbonation
this
is
a
wonderful
session
beer
and
a
great
deal
for
a
good
honest
beer
i
like
saranacs
entire
catalogue
even
their
root
beer
i
just
couldnt
rave
about
this
beer
as
much
as
i
wanted
to
it
poured
well
into
a
pint
glass
with
a
full
head
nice
and
thick
it
reduced
down
to
pretty
poor
lacing
after
a
few
sips
the
color
reminds
me
of
pasturized
apple
cider
but
the
taste
was
anthing
but
sweet
or
fruity
the
taste
was
kind
of
dull
although
a
little
bitter
it
had
plenty
of
carbonation
and
floated
over
my
tongue
this
beer
might
have
turned
or
be
on
the
verge
of
turning
ill
have
to
give
this
one
another
chance
d
it
was
a
little
tastier
that
i
thought
it
would
be
goes
down
easy
not
very
filling
my
expectations
of
matt
brewing
have
been
lowered
after
trying
their
pale
ale
and
ipa
so
i
thought
this
beer
was
going
to
be
terrible
it
wasnt
anything
special
by
any
means
however
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
fact
that
i
found
the
beer
to
be
pretty
decent
md
too
sour
and
ricey
for
my
palate
i
dont
care
for
this
very
much
i
may
try
this
again
in
the
future
just
to
see
if
this
one
didnt
turn
drinkability
i
wasnt
too
fond
of
the
beer
bitterness
and
malted
taste
turned
me
off
the
drinkability
is
ok
nothing
bad
just
nothing
above
norm
either
i
would
not
buy
this
beer
out
of
a
mixed
sampler
mk
goes
down
easy
and
is
equally
easy
to
enjoy
not
as
complex
or
sublime
as
some
other
lagers
of
this
style
but
an
excellent
session
brew
that
doesnt
give
the
palate
a
workout
but
doesnt
leave
it
bored
either
not
bad
but
a
bit
underwhelming
for
a
craft
beer
dont
have
much
else
to
say
about
it
d
not
a
bad
beer
sessionable
easy
drinking
a
good
choice
to
break
in
a
macrodrinker
maybe
overall
an
average
beer
a
good
choice
to
go
with
a
plate
of
wings
another
slightly
above
average
from
a
saranac
mixed
twelve
pack
nice
to
try
the
style
from
a
different
brewer
but
nothing
to
run
out
to
find
over
this
beer
is
a
very
drinkable
beer
i
like
it
is
better
than
the
yeungling
special
lager
and
have
no
problem
drnking
this
in
a
bmc
bar
drinkabilityi
could
have
a
few
of
these
with
no
complaints
the
whole
thing
while
very
drinkable
is
rather
lowkey
and
nothing
sensational
theres
just
not
much
to
say
about
this
one
ive
only
had
three
different
saranac
beers
so
far
this
the
pale
ale
and
the
india
pale
ale
all
decent
but
none
outstanding
im
hoping
one
of
those
more
interesting
beers
in
the
winter
sampler
12pack
makes
me
sit
up
and
take
serious
notice
the
taste
was
wellbalanced
between
the
malt
backbone
and
floral
hops
it
wasnt
overpowering
or
interesting
but
it
wasnt
bad
either
average
mouthfeel
was
clean
and
crisp
and
the
beer
is
fairly
drinkable
i
was
expecting
the
worst
with
this
one
and
its
not
really
that
bad
nothing
stands
out
about
it
either
though
got
this
one
in
the
12
beers
of
winter
sampler
overall
ive
been
really
impressed
with
saranacs
offerings
but
not
this
one
i
expected
this
to
be
their
benchmark
beer
and
found
it
to
be
the
worst
of
their
line
the
adirodack
lager
smelled
coppery
and
tasted
the
same
too
bitter
and
too
much
hops
for
a
lager
in
my
opinion
poured
a
pale
amber
color
with
a
2
finger
head
that
dissipates
quickly
doesnt
have
a
pronounced
smell
typical
saranac
trait
but
has
a
light
malt
hoppy
smell
to
it
the
hop
taste
hits
right
away
followed
by
the
caramel
malt
no
noticable
lingering
bitterness
easy
to
drink
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
but
would
choose
not
to
there
are
better
offerings
for
this
style
saranacs
offerings
seem
to
be
real
middle
of
the
road
nothing
really
stands
out
looks
fine
but
then
it
really
goes
down
from
there
with
a
rough
aroma
and
a
rougher
taste
mouthfeel
is
ok
save
for
the
lingering
taste
in
all
not
a
very
drinkable
beer
when
you
add
it
all
up
i
suppose
it
gets
the
job
done
but
not
happily
very
likely
not
my
favorite
style
of
beer
poured
12
oz
bottle
into
a
glass
mug
nice
light
golden
color
with
a
thick
white
head
a
subtle
malty
smell
well
balanced
by
some
hops
same
with
the
taste
malty
with
a
subtle
hoppy
after
taste
that
balances
off
the
malt
very
well
decent
mouthfeel
typical
of
most
american
amber
lagers
very
drinkable
beer
halfway
through
it
i
was
looking
forward
to
another
one
just
based
on
the
ease
of
drinking
good
beer
and
well
worth
a
look
another
winter
pack
beer
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
moderate
head
and
some
retention
and
lacing
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
pint
glass
has
a
malty
smell
to
it
with
a
bit
of
citrus
at
the
end
mostly
malty
with
more
than
just
a
hint
of
hops
unusually
bitter
has
a
slight
citrus
taste
to
it
as
well
as
a
hint
of
caramel
feels
fairly
light
in
the
mouth
with
a
decent
amount
of
carbonation
easy
to
drink
overall
a
decent
beer
but
nothing
too
special
after
suffering
through
the
11
other
beers
in
the
saranac
12
pack
this
was
a
great
way
to
finish
i
am
usually
not
a
lager
fan
and
find
them
quite
boring
this
one
is
nicely
flavored
full
bodied
and
fairly
interesting
there
is
a
touch
of
diacetyl
but
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
mixed
12
this
is
a
vast
improvement
this
one
from
saranac
is
one
of
their
finest
for
the
price
you
can
beat
this
company
the
adirondack
lager
is
far
and
away
much
superior
to
their
plain
lager
definitely
worth
the
price
of
admission
all
in
all
pretty
good
saranac
is
kind
of
a
weird
brewery
for
me
very
middle
of
the
road
all
their
beers
are
excellent
crossovers
for
a
macro
drinker
looking
for
micros
pours
amber
red
with
little
head
the
nose
is
nothing
to
write
home
about
straight
forward
hops
and
malt
taste
is
smooth
and
highly
drinkable
i
think
my
favorite
out
of
the
sampler
containing
the
pale
ale
and
ipa
as
the
other
selections
d
yep
like
yuengling
i
could
have
this
a
good
bit
jcdiflorio
did
you
get
the
12
beers
of
winter
too
the
beer
was
decent
but
not
awsome
it
poured
a
nice
light
amber
color
with
very
little
head
there
was
no
retention
an
no
lace
there
wasnt
much
aftertaste
and
the
lager
taste
was
decent
but
not
very
great
dont
drink
and
review
a
couple
of
steps
above
a
macro
not
quite
a

inbetween
an
excellent

a
beer
for
the

just
a
bit
more
a
good
slightly
dark

a
good
change
of

pours
a

with
a

to

mild

light

inoffensive
but
on
the
boring
side
not
sure
why
this
is
in
a
winter
seasonal
pack
pours
a
nice
copper
with
a
sizable
head
bright
in
color
and
leaves
a
fair
amount
of
lacing
smells
of
caramel
and
malts
a
smooth
taste
that
is
smoky
and
has
some
character
but
nothing
that
wows
me
the
mouthfeel
is
balanced
and
crisp
would
make
a
nice
session
lager
dnot
bad
for
the
pricebut
ive
had
way
better
for
this
style
i
dont
think
ill
be
having
this
lager
again
very
drinkable
with
meals
without
meals
i
could
have
a
few
of
these
easily
its
a
bit
hoppy
to
do
too
many
insession
i
think
handcarried
from
new
york
to
moscow
thanks
mark
the
beer
pours
a
clear
amber
orange
under
a
very
shortlived
offwhite
one
finger
head
that
leaves
no
lace
there
is
a
nice
sweet
malt
nose
with
hints
of
caramel
the
mouth
is
light
and
fairly
prickly
nice
taste
here
sweet
malt
floral
hops
the
full
package
blended
smoothly
the
aftertaste
has
a
mild
spicey
bite
with
the
sweetness
accompanying
for
a
long
time
very
pleasant
drinkability
you
could
through
these
back
if
wanted
too
im
glad
there
were
only
a
couple
in
this
mix
pack
i
wont
revisit
this
one
odd
that
this
is
an
american
amber
red
lager
as
its
more
golden
than
amber
by
all
means
it
pours
a
distinctly
golden
color
with
a
fair
amount
of
head
its
got
a
fair
bit
of
hops
on
the
nose
for
a
lager
and
slight
touch
of
pine
as
noticed
by
other
members
though
i
couldnt
immediately
place
it
the
flavor
is
primarily
hops
and
a
fruity
malt
sweetness
the
mouthfeel
is
average
for
this
variety
of
beer
its
a
very
easy
beer
to
drink
easily
consumed
en
masse
but
while
it
is
somewhat
distinctive
compared
to
other
american
amber
lagers
im
not
sure
if
that
makes
it
necessarily
better
than
the
others
its
certainly
better
than
saranacs
traditional
lager
though
there
may
be
better
alternatives
but
this
one
deserves
a
recommendation
for
being
pleasant
yet
distinct
halfway
through
the
glass
despairing
of
finishing
it
at
all
i
discovered
that
a
piece
of
decent
white
bread
actually
does
a
pretty
good
job
of
smoothing
it
out
and
absorbing
a
lot
of
the
overpowering
bitterness
but
it
still
doesnt
make
it
worth
while
dgoes
down
nice
and
easy
and
has
a
nice
balance
of
flavors
which
makes
this
easy
to
drink
an
enjoyable
brew
simple
and
to
the
point
with
no
frills
d
its
ok
while
its
easy
to
drink
a
lot
of
these
im
glad
there
are
only
two
in
my
sixpack
medium
body
lighttomoderate
carbonation
balance
is
pretty
good
overall
a
pretty
mild
beer
not
bad
but
nothing
tremendously
compelling
probably
wouldnt
be
bad
as
a
session
beer
d
it
is
an
okay
brew
ive
had
better
but
it
is
certainly
drinkable
had
one
with
dinner
looked
pretty
good
clear
amber
color
nice
white
head
that
fades
to
a
covering
of
the
top
of
the
glass
very
little
spotty
lacing
the
aroma
is
very
faint
some
hops
but
nothing
stands
out
taste
and
mouthfeel
were
pretty
good
very
light
taste
nicely
balanced
between
hops
and
malt
very
crisp
and
easy
to
drink
no
unpleasant
aftertaste
i
like
this
as
well
or
better
than
kilians
this
is
not
a
standout
style
for
me
but
this
beer
fits
in
failrly
nicely
would
be
an
ok
session
beer
dsomewhat
drinkable
but
i
would
probably
have
to
switch
after
the
2nd
one
thanks
len
d
semi
drinkable
lager
the
bland
taste
at
first
doesnt
really
appeal
to
me
although
drinkable
id
go
with
a
different
lager
before
this
one
perhaps
the
temp
at
which
i
had
this
beer
was
too
high
and
it
should
have
been
coldernot
sure
that
would
have
made
a
huge
difference
however
drinkability
easy
drinking
for
sure
drinkability
this
beer
is
suitable
for
someone
making
a
jump
from
bmc
to
craft
brews
it
is
solidly
made
just
a
little
light
in
flavor
pretty
good
for
what
youll
probably
pay
for
it
not
really
my
cup
of
beer
flavor
wise
but
this
is
pretty
good
at
what
it
is
trying
to
be
amber
color
duh
clear
some
head
hints
of
lacing
nose
is
lightly
malty
and
bready
very
faint
taste
is
in
a
word
malty
a
bit
of
a
soy
sauce
thing
going
on
a
fruity
thing
im
not
really
digging
a
bit
bready
something
about
it
i
just
dont
like
mouthfeel
is
a
bit
thin
a
bit
harsh
even
i
guess
i
can
see
a
lot
of
people
liking
this
its
not
too
overpowering
and
its
light
enough
but
i
just
dont
dig
it
d
very
easy
to
drink
a
great
summer
beer
as
it
is
refreshing
and
light
it
pours
a
clear
copperamber
color
with
a
14
inch
head
which
goes
away
very
quickly
theres
a
maltysweet
smell
to
the
beer
but
its
not
very
strong
it
tastes
malty
with
a
little
caramel
taste
to
it
and
a
slight
bit
of
hops
at
the
end
its
not
a
strong
flavor
at
all
but
still
more
flavor
than
pretty
much
every
macrobrewed
beer
out
there
the
adirondack
lager
has
lightmedium
body
and
it
is
pretty
easy
to
drink
even
if
it
is
on
the
watery
side
not
a
great
beer
but
its
something
i
could
have
as
a
session
beer
now
and
then
ill
have
to
try
more
saranac
beers
and
see
how
they
compare
d
overall
a
good
beer
that
will
satisfy
the
masses
this
is
ten
times
better
than
yuengling
lager
living
in
pa
we
tend
to
get
yuenglinged
to
death
this
is
a
nice
alternative
actually
served
this
at
a
party
last
weekend
to
good
reviews
will
definately
buy
again
a
good
hot
summer
day
beer
mouth
it
enters
with
a
strong
carbonated
feeling
on
the
tongue
but
without
a
lot
of
flavor
it
hits
a
gentle
sour
note
on
the
way
back
but
is
most
notable
in
the
dry
hoppy
bitterness
that
is
pleasant
but
has
no
depth
has
an
alcoholic
warmth
that
surprised
me
considering
theres
no
sweetness
or
alcohol
in
the
aroma
tastes
a
bit
like
rice
it
might
be
refreshing
on
a
hot
day
but
there
are
better
examples
of
this
type
that
would
do
the
same
standard
color
for
an
american
amber
and
standard
head
and
lacing
there
is
a
nice
hop
aroma
once
poured
into
a
pint
glass
the
flavor
is
subtle
like
most
saranac
beers
in
fact
saranac
beers
are
all
good
examples
of
their
respective
styles
the
beer
poured
a
medium
gold
with
a
small
white
head
the
lace
held
throughout
the
aroma
was
malt
and
hops
the
taste
was
fairly
malty
with
enough
hops
to
give
it
a
bitter
edge
the
feel
was
medium
and
dry
not
a
bad
beer
but
nothing
i
would
see
bringing
me
back
for
more
a
bit
like
a
standard
macro
or
regional
lager
to
review
watery
slightly
interesting
but
not
enough
for
me
to
come
back
for
more
d
all
in
all
decent
for
the
style
too
bad
it
doesnt
taste
better
this
looks
a
little
like
apple
juice
on
the
pour
in
fact
after
the
first
sip
it
tastes
a
little
like
apple
juice
too
the
smell
is
uninteresting
at
best
appearance
is
also
lackluster
the
most
complex
the
flavor
gets
is
slightly
more
cidery
some
bland
malts
this
was
a
part
of
a
mix
pack
im
saving
the
second
one
for
a
snakebite
drinkable
but
not
that
desirable
this
is
the
adirondack
not
the
light
too
man
im
really
gettin
into
saranac
brews
pours
out
to
a
dark
golden
amber
color
with
a
18
inch
head
of
foam
and
residual
lacing
medium
level
of
carbonation
aroms
of
fresh
malts
and
grass
fill
the
nose
some
biscuit
notes
taste
was
medium
bodied
flavors
of
sweet
medium
malts
wood
bread
and
some
hop
bitterness
were
well
balanced
mouthfeel
was
decent
not
overly
carbonated
or
flat
with
a
slickness
about
itself
very
good
drinkability
this
would
make
a
great
brew
to
keep
on
hand
during
the
autumn
months
recommended
thanks
goes
out
to
conneticutpoet
for
providing
the
sample
cheers
this
beer
pours
a
dark
honey
color
looks
really
nice
in
a
tulip
with
lighter
gold
around
the
edges
picking
up
more
and
more
browns
toward
the
center
the
head
is
frothy
white
and
thin
and
leaves
some
fantastic
lace
smells
a
bit
like
honey
too
with
some
clover
and
orange
and
a
slight
doughy
malt
tasted
foul
theres
a
heavy
sour
corn
base
that
is
just
destroyed
by
a
huge
mechanical
aluminum
dryness
starts
with
caramel
corn
then
to
lemons
then
to
aluminum
there
arent
any
smooth
biscuit
lagerlike
characteristics
here
at
all
the
metallic
dryness
carries
long
into
the
finish
oh
wait
somewhere
in
the
crappy
dry
finish
i
managed
to
pull
out
something
that
was
reminiscent
of
a
lager
aha
if
i
chug
this
beer
it
manages
to
taste
a
little
more
red
and
the
dryness
dies
down
my
problem
was
that
i
was
trying
to
enjoy
this
beer
silly
me
the
mouth
feel
is
a
bit
light
almost
dry
with
a
nice
fluffy
carbonation
everything
was
all
right
with
this
beer
other
than
the
obstructive
dryness
worth
a
try
once
id
prefer
sam
adams
or
brooklyn
lager
if
given
a
choice
maybe
one
of
the
11
beers
left
in
my
pack
will
impress
me
more
pours
out
a
nice
copper
color
with
a
thin
but
sticky
white
head
very
aromatic
fruity
hops
a
little
salty
in
the
smell
as
well
it
tastes
better
than
it
smells
a
sweet
hop
with
good
balance
the
hop
reminds
me
of
sam
adams
lager
it
has
a
typical
light
bodied
mouthfeel
incredibly
easy
to
drink
a
great
offering
for
the
price
it
could
have
a
more
interestingcomplex
taste
and
that
would
be
my
only
complaint
but
it
is
good
at
what
it
is
mouthfeel
is
light
and
slick
drain
ho
drinkability
is
good
the
smooth
feel
along
with
a
decent
taste
makes
this
a
drinkable
beer
one
of
the
few
lagers
in
the
12
beers
of
christmas
12
pack
pours
a
clear
amber
color
with
minimal
head
and
lacing
smell
is
sweet
and
malty
with
some
herbal
hops
in
the
background
taste
is
well
balanced
between
the
biscuity
malts
and
heral
hops
light
enough
in
body
to
pound
more
than
one
similar
to
yuengling
traditional
lager
a
good
if
uninspired
lager
drinkability
highly
sessionable
it
wont
fatigue
the
palate
or
the
drinker
nothing
too
exciting
but
would
make
a
good
gatewaycrossover
beer
for
the
nonba
worth
a
try
mouth
feel
is
light
bodied
and
a
bit
watery
d
good
goes
well
even
with
spicy
dishes
i
had
it
with
kim
chi
ji
gae
after
i
figured
out
the
flavor
and
smell
of
course
and
it
was
a
wonderful
match
would
not
go
well
with
sweeter
foods
at
all
though
drinkability
this
has
been
the
best
beer
in
the
box
i
wish
i
had
another
taste
another
below
average
tasting
saranac
beer
this
one
like
so
many
others
simply
lacks
in
the
flavor
department
theres
nothing
repulsive
about
it
theres
just
nothing
great
here
everything
feels
toned
down
its
crisp
and
refreshing
though
and
would
go
well
on
a
hot
day
poured
a
deep
clear
amber
with
a
quickly
fading
white
head
that
left
no
lacing
at
all
the
aroma
was
mostly
sweet
grain
with
a
fairly
subdued
earthy
hop
smell
the
taste
was
much
the
same
being
dominated
by
bready
grain
with
a
mild
hop
kick
at
the
end
decent
carbonation
and
solid
body
but
otherwise
a
fairly
bland
brew
that
i
wont
be
getting
again
it
is
fairly
refreshing
at
least
pretty
good
drinkability
but
that
bite
at
the
end
could
take
its
toll
after
a
couple
a
pretty
typical
amber
lager
type
beer
nothing
special
that
i
would
ever
seek
out
though
this
is
a
really
good
red
beer
the
color
of
this
beer
is
reddish
amber
it
is
a
lot
lighter
than
other
red
beers
the
smell
is
hoppy
for
the
style
the
taste
reminds
me
of
an
ipa
is
this
a
red
ipa
is
there
such
a
thing
the
mouthfeel
is
very
good
as
well
fair
bitterness
a
small
bit
of
twangy
aftertaste
the
drinkability
would
certainly
be
more
than
the
two
i
got
as
part
of
a
sampler
if
this
beer
was
set
in
front
of
me
unlabled
i
would
have
mistaked
it
for
an
ipa
not
an
over
the
top
hopped
up
ipa
this
is
a
good
beer
that
i
will
seek
out
in
the
future
all
and
all
a
pretty
good
red
beer
ive
had
better
and
ive
had
alot
worse
well
worth
a
try
i
pulled
the
adirondack
lager
from
the
saranac
12
beers
of
winter
variety
pack
which
has
yielded
some
pleasant
surprises
so
far
this
lager
pours
a
pale
golden
color
with
perfect
clarity
a
medium
white
head
forms
and
leaves
lacing
after
disappearing
the
aroma
is
very
understated
dominated
by
a
maltiness
the
taste
is
like
the
aroma
dominated
by
the
malts
its
fairly
sweet
but
not
cloyingly
so
a
hint
of
hops
come
in
to
cut
the
sweetness
a
bit
this
is
an
easy
drinking
lager
not
designed
for
serious
contemplation
i
would
have
enjoyed
it
a
bit
more
if
it
was
a
bit
less
sweet
and
the
hoppiness
was
just
a
bit
stronger
still
this
isnt
a
bad
beer
by
any
stretch
great
session
beer
this
beer
lacks
a
real
definable
character
and
is
just
a
beer
is
a
mass
of
beers
no
flavors
pull
through
or
stick
out
but
everything
is
balanced
well
too
an
okay
beer
good
enough
at
the
time
but
i
probably
wony
seek
it
out
intentionally
easy
drinking
and
tasty
not
great
but
the
price
is
right
for
an
amber
lager
pick
one
up
for
5sixer
if
you
can
the
flavor
starts
with
a
sweet
roasted
maltyness
which
is
very
smooth
it
then
moves
to
a
bold
hoppy
finish
quite
a
nice
complex
flavor
overall
a
better
than
average
lager
better
than
typical
macro
swill
but
not
really
worth
seeking
out
on
its
own
poured
a
12
ounce
bottle
from
saranacs
12
beers
of
winter
or
christmas
like
the
bottle
said
the
beer
poured
a
nice
golden
amber
color
but
didnt
have
much
of
a
head
granted
i
dont
pour
as
aggressively
as
others
do
what
constituted
as
a
head
didnt
stick
around
very
long
either
no
signs
of
lacing
floral
character
in
the
aroma
from
the
hops
but
sort
of
mixed
up
cant
distinguish
any
particular
smell
that
dominates
a
relatively
good
balance
between
the
bitterness
of
the
hops
present
and
some
roasted
malts
for
sweetness
but
it
does
come
across
as
a
hodgepodge
of
flavors
that
hasnt
quite
blended
well
yet
rather
crisp
from
the
carbonation
too
aside
from
all
of
this
it
is
a
drinkable
beer
slightly
above
average
in
my
opinion
i
rather
enjoyed
this
one
its
appearance
was
nothing
to
get
excited
about
especially
with
the
head
flattening
out
real
quick
the
smell
was
interesting
with
a
sort
of
malt
liquoresque
vibe
going
on
just
less
of
the
alcoholiness
had
kind
of
a
hop
spike
to
the
smell
too
the
taste
had
a
kind
of
mellow
hoppiness
to
it
with
a
maltiness
infused
as
well
as
a
light
fruitiness
no
real
aftertaste
to
speak
of
which
can
be
a
good
thing
for
a
beer
this
light
overall
it
was
a
easily
drinkable
beer
this
is
something
that
would
go
well
with
pretty
much
any
type
of
food
it
could
definately
be
a
football
beer
honey
colorand
not
much
of
a
head
smell
was
not
great
no
hint
of
nut
kind
of
skunky
in
fact
taste
was
sour
it
was
on
the
light
side
finish
was
a
bit
skunky
i
expected
better
i
would
not
recommend
this
beer
dont
go
out
of
your
way
to
buy
this
beer
brew
has
a
nice
dull
brass
color
with
a
great
2
inch
off
white
head
that
has
very
good
retention
and
leaves
a
bunch
of
lacing
down
the
sides
of
the
brew
the
aromas
a
grainy
with
a
slight
toasted
characteristic
a
pleasant
smelling
brew
the
taste
is
very
smooth
has
a
toasted
like
flavor
along
with
just
the
right
amount
of
bitterness
at
the
end
the
bitterness
is
very
subtle
but
really
seems
to
balance
out
this
brew
quite
efficiently
if
youre
looking
for
something
exotic
in
a
brew
this
is
not
it
but
imo
this
is
a
very
easy
brew
to
drink
in
larger
amounts
because
it
is
cheap
here
in
new
york
and
just
has
a
solid
taste
to
it
i
would
recommend
it
to
anyone
that
is
trying
to
bridge
the
gap
from
mass
marketed
macro
brews
very
good
offering
from
matts
saranac
this
is
a
pretty
dark
lager
its
honey
coloredbut
the
head
is
small
and
disappears
fast
this
smells
a
little
hoppywith
some
fruitiness
and
yeast
this
isnt
a
bad
tasting
lager
its
hoppier
than
most
with
a
hint
of
cooked
veggies
or
fruit
the
big
problem
with
this
beer
is
the
weak
head
and
the
poor
mf
this
is
very
weak
and
watery
which
leads
me
to
say
i
dont
think
id
buy
this
again
a
pretty
simple
brew
sampled
froma
12
pack
variety
looks
well

with
moderate
carbonation
and
an
impressive

in
the
aroma
light

aroma
with

again

moderate
to
light
and
finishes
a
bit
sweet
with
a
slight

and

bite
a
bit

in
the
aftertaste
overall
average
ill
try
again
but
wont
seek
it
out
specifically
nice
bitter
hoppy
bite
with
a
kick
of
roasted
malt
and
a
smooth
aftertaste
and
clean
finish
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
that
still
brings
a
good
deal
of
flavor
to
the
table
a
pleasant
surprise
at
a
reasonable
price
overall
this
is
a
nice
lager
to
have
one
or
two
of
with
dinner
must
be

new

here
light

flavorful
nothing
bad
really
to
say
about
this
and
its
quite
cheap
ive
been
drinking
this
beer
for
a
while
its
actually
one
of
the
beers
that
got
me
away
from
the
standard
american
macro
taste
which
may
make
me
a
little
bit
partial
and
i
really
enjoy
it
its
nothing
special
but
its
a
good
beer
and
worth
the
5
or
6
bucks
a
six
pack
its
actually
pretty
flavorful
reminds
me
a
little
bit
of
the
otter
creek
vermont
lager
it
pours
a
nice
amber
color
and
is
medium
bodied
this
and
sa
boston
lager
are
the
two
lagers
i
buy
most
frequently
its
worth
a
shot
has
a
decent
amount
of
flavor
for
the
money
drinkability
pretty
refreshing
i
know
there
are
better
ones
out
there
and
this
is
from
the
mixed
6pack
so
i
have
another
left
right
now
i
could
make
this
a
session
for
sure
id
say
and
im
sure
some
people
do
as
saranacs
beers
are
very
cheap
and
the
taste
certainly
outweighs
the
price
also
in
my
opinion
boy
a
solidly
good
amber
lager
not
that
adventurous
but
really
nails
the
style
a
big
step
above
other
saranac
offerings
im
not
sure
that
an
amberred
lager
could
get
much
better
than
this
tastewise

is
really
enjoyable
and
doesnt
reek
of
adjunct
taste
is
clearly
refreshing
while
still
keeping
a
strong
presence
of

a

with

is
soon
evened
out
by
the
yeasty

overall
this
one
isnt

good
one
is
enough
for
me
thin
frail
and
boring
comparable
to
an
average
macro
a
very
enjoyable
beer
on
a
sunny
afternoon
pours
a
medium
amber
with
a
1
finger
head
that
had
ok
longevity
and
pretty
good
lace
aromas
of
a
mild
caramel
malt
with
some
very
slight
vanilla
and
raisin
smells
as
well
some
noticeable
hop
presence
stronger
hop
flavors
than
i
anticipated
and
some
caramel
malt
flavors
as
well
but
the
hops
are
too
sharp
and
strong
for
this
brew
could
be
balanced
better
fairly
high
carbonation
and
dry
not
a
bad
beer
and
still
drinkable
but
the
hop
presence
in
this
one
is
just
too
sharp
to
be
even
an
average
beer
pours
a
clear
golden
amber
with
just
a
thin
cap
of
head
that
sticks
around
throughout
nose
is
slight
and
is
of
bready
malts
taste
is
bready
maltiness
upfront
with
a
slight
grassy
hops
presense
in
the
back
aftertaste
is
slightly
metallic
and
not
enjoyable
mouthfeel
is
a
little
slin
and
watery
but
the
carbonation
is
at
least
at
a
good
level
overall
this
is
an
simple
average
beer
that
might
appeal
to
macro
drinkers
nice
especially
when
you
get
it
on
sale
it
isnt
top
notch
but
it
is
a
nice
drink
the
appearance
is
nice
amber
gold
with
a
light
tan
head
the
smell
is
pleasant
with
some
hoppiness
to
it
the
taste
is
adirondacky
that
made
no
sense
but
it
is
some
malts
some
hops
you
could
drain
these
all
day
but
not
feel
liek
a
cheap
beer
whore
because
it
is
good
a
great
staple
beer
even
nonbeer
drinkers
may
find
this
one
pretty
good
pours
a
rich
sparkling
amber
in
color
finger
deep
spongey
head
on
top
the
nose
is
very
slight
malts
the
flavor
is
not
particularly
complex
which
is
why
i
think
nonbeer
drinkers
would
like
this
one
the
malts
are
pretty
straightforward
and
balanced
nicely
with
the
hops
there
are
strong
apple
tones
in
the
flavor
little
bit
of
spice
maybe
cinnamon
mouthfeel
is
full
of
flavor
and
nicely
rounded
very
smooth
and
drinkable
this
is
a
good
everyday
beer
not
complex
but
satisfying
if
you
dont
overanalyze
it
if
only
saranac
can
make
their
beers
taste
as
good
as
they
can
make
them
appear
good
lacing
i
may
be
getting
some
bandaid
smell
now
not
sure
i
feel
its
okay
a
step
above
mediocre
this
is
a
little
beer
pours
amber
with
a
little
head
smells
a
little
hoppy
tastes
an
equally
little
amount
malty
and
hoppy
mouthfeel
is
nice
and
smooth
actually
but
maybe
a
little
too
smooth
i
probably
could
drink
a
lot
of
these
but
i
dont
really
want
to
only
a
little
bit
lacks
character
decent
cheap
fallback
beer
or
a
beer
for
introducinig
people
to
better
beer
little
drinkability
good
a
little
lacking
in
depth
and
balance
but
a
highly
sessionable

gets

you
go

is

happy

some

the

and
make
for

very

quenching
all
around
a

i
must
say
pours
a
very
lightcolored
amber

clear
with
a
scant
whitishcolored

minimal

are
more

than
i
expected
with
a
grassy

mixed
with
some

flavor

quite
light
sorta
reminds
me
of
a
mild
almost
nothing
too
busy
finish
is
crisp
and
shortlived
on
the
borderline
of
being
thin
in
mouthfeel
its
still
drinkable
oelergud
drinkabilitycomments
again
if
one
were
to
isolate
the
baseline
for
saranac
beers
this
one
would
be
closest
to
it
not
that
theres
anything
inherently
wrong
with
that
as
this
is
actually
a
pretty
tasty
beer
drinkability
and
overall
im
kicking
myself
for
picking
up
a
case
of
different
saranac
beers
one
by
one
theyre
getting
worse
i
hope
none
of
them
fall
below
this
cause
this
is
just
gross
this
beer
has
a
clear
amber
color
the
head
is
large
when
first
poured
but
doesnt
stick
around
long
there
is
almost
no
smell
just
a
lit
malty
sweetness
the
flavor
follows
from
the
smell
not
at
all
hoppy
this
beer
is
all
around
average
or
maybe
slightly
below
it
is
drinkable
but
that
is
just
because
the
flavors
are
so
light
in
fact
this
beer
reminds
me
of
a
light
beer
better
than
the
dos
equis
i
had
with
my
mexican
dinner
last
night
but
not
by
a
huge
margin
pours
medium
copper
very
translucent
one
finger
head
that
quickly
dissipates
not
a
lot
of
carbonation
but
enough
to
get
you
through
without
making
you
burp
between
drinks
smells
of
mild
wheat
and
hops
taste
follows
with
wheat
some
light
hops
and
a
hint
of
fruity
sweetness
mouthfeel
is
decent
good
enough
for
this
light
brew
overall
pretty
decent
beer
i
cant
really
get
into
this
once
again
this
saranac
beer
tastes
too
watery
not
very
well
balanced
and
with
this
being
my
farewell
tour
to
an
old
tradition
from
the
early
days
of
my
beer
explorations
i
say
goodbye
to
the
saranac
12
beers
holiday
pack
i
will
never
purchase
you
again

like
most
of

line
somewhat
thin

an

amber
lager
that
has
a
lot
of
disarray
going
on
never
seeming
to
meld
into
a
cohesive
whole
one
of
saranacs
better
brews
which
doesnt
really
say
much
their
yeast
strain
is
just
too
funky
for
me
and
it
doesnt
suit
they
styles
they
are
going
for
mouthfeel
was
fairly
pleasant
with
many
tastebuds
working
albeit
not
very
hard
to
sample
the
brew
beer
is
very
easy
to
drink
and
is
fairly
pleasant
to
do
so
this
would
be
a
perfect
beer
to
have
at
a
ballpark
or
on
the
back
deck
on
a
late
spring
or
early
fall
day
a
good
beer
thats
obviously
pretty
drinkable
nothing
to
write
home
about
but
in
terms
of
flavor
theres
nothing
unpleasant
about
this
one
either
poured
into

not

bad
a

than
a

i
think
good
flavor
just
a
bit
different
than
most
of
the
ambers
out
there
overalla
fine
flavorful
amber
lager
ive
noticed
that
it
has
many
redeeming
characteristics
you
could
do
much
worse
the
only
problem
you
may
find
is
that
there
is
too
much
going
on
so
i
would
try
it
out
and
see
what
you
think
i
was
impressed
though
on
the
other
hand
i
cant
find
any
flaws
besides
the
above
so
i
cant
quite
say
this
is
a
below
average
beer
enjoyed
this
beer
after
buying
the

six
pack
with
4
types
of

why
dont
more
breweries
sell
6
packs
this

nice
color

could
enjoy
this
beer
all
evening
no
bad
qualities
to
note
very
smooth

i
would
recommend
to
others
enjoying
amber
beers
this
is
a
great

brew
a

taste
of
its

the
characteristic
of
any
main
stream
brews
with
alot
more
flavor

a

beer
for
any
time
give
it
a
try

taste
this
time
in
the
finish
there
is
nothing
speicla
about
this
brew
very
bland
very
boring
its
drinkable
but
very
basic
and
far
from
outstanding
i
dont
believe
im
saying
this
but
i
think
id
actually
prefer
a
killians
to
this
one
aroma
is
typical
of
the
style
mildly
spicy
clovelike
taste
is
good
with
a
moderate
amount
of
hops
and
nice
carbonation
leaving
a
slightly
bitter
aftertaste
finishes
strong
easy
to
drink
overall
a
good
brew
but
again
not
that
special
this
is
a
suprisingly
descent
amber
lager
it
pours
a
very
nice
intermediate
amber
depth
of
color
a
nice
white
foamy
head
arises
but
unfortunately
does
not
last
very
long
the
taste
has
a
nice
hoppy
bitterness
there
is
not
much
on
the
malty
side
not
a
bad
beer
when
options
are
limited
and
this
is
an
option
give
it
a
try
drinkability
reasonable
session
beer
dont
know
if
id
seek
it
out
but
im
glad
to
have
tried
it
so
far
all
saranac
beers
have
tasted
very
similar
and
this
one
is
no
different
golden
colored
with
a
below
average
head
and
almost
no
retention
smelled
fresh
and
crisp
a
little
fruity
the
taste
is
pretty
good
somewhat
fruity
and
tastes
a
little
bit
like
cherries
it
left
my
mouth
a
little
dry
a
decent
beer
but
theres
better
beers
for
this
style
saranac
adirondack
lager
is
average
beer
in
the
end
perhaps
a
little
above
average
since
im
feeling
generous
but
i
wont
be
buying
it
again
12
ounce
bottle
no
freshness
dating
nothing
too
exciting
going
on
light
amber
white
head
leaving
a
small
bit
of
lacing
simple
amber
lager
mildly
malted
very
little
hops
seems
watered
down
as
do
most
of
this
line
of
brews
price
is
right
but
i
guess
you
get
what
you
pay
for
this
is
a
drinkable
quafer
better
then
the
larger
macros
a
decent
starter
beer
for
a
newbie
pretty
tame
for
a
ba
char
definitely
a
step
up
from
your
average
macro
but
not
quite
there
for
one
with
a
more
refined
palate
decent
but
plain
and
forgettable
deep
copper
color
with
a
huge
white
head
taste
is
sweet
and
smooth
with
a
moderate
amount
of
carbonation
nice
hops
finish
but
still
lacking
in
flavor
could
use
more
hops
but
i
say
that
about
nearly
everything
the
best
of
the
3
saranacs
i
have
tried
from
the
sampler
pack
frankly
a
little
disappointing
particularly
from
saranac
ill
finish
this
one
but
wont
necessarily
seek
another
this
is
a
highly
drinkable
beer
with
enough
flavor
to
please
but
not
too
strong
a
good
choice
to
help
bring
macro
drinkers
away
from
the
dark
side
this
is
a
decent
amber
lager
nothing
special
not
much
head
or
lacing
i
would
say
that
it
is
drinkable
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
too
much
of
a
hop
profile
very
malty
for
a
lager
almost
reminds
me
more
of
an
amber
ale
the
taste
seems
to
have
a
lot
of
caramel
in
it
the
beer
itself
seems
to
dry
my
mouth
as
far
as
drinkability
it
is
okay
the
label
asked
me
to
look
for
golden
amber
color
and
medium
body
i
certainly
found
the
golden
amber
that
was
topped
off
with
a
modest
white
head
that
left
a
thin
layer
of
foam
along
the
side
of
the
glass
i
got
mostly
a
tart
citrus
aroma
distinctly
lemon
and
soy
the
mouthfeel
was
thinner
than
medium
and
the
carbonation
was
more
understated
than
i
found
in
the
saranac
pale
ale
and
their
ipa
the
first
taste
is
sharp
but
it
mutes
quickly
and
does
not
linger
with
any
complexity
maybe
a
suggestion
of
bread
at
the
very
finish
an
okay
session
brew
id
say
tastes
pretty
good
very
hoppy
and
not
to
strong
this
is
a
good
warmweather
type
of
beer
nice
and
easy
to
drink
this
one
poured
an
amber
color
duh
with
a
white
head
and
no
lacing
very
clean
the
aroma
wasnt
very
strong
but
there
was
some
sweet
malt
in
there
the
flavor
was
mostly
comprised
of
the
sweet
malt
some
hops
as
well
very
easy
to
drink
and
quite
enjoyable
cuts
through
spicy
food
well
medium
to
light
bodied
not
great
but
it
goes
down
easily
a
little
unfinished
the
flavors
and
aroma
need
to
be
sorted
out
and
tweaked
drinkability
not
too
bad
i
could
see
myself
enjoying
this
on
a
fall
or
spring
day
if
offered
but
i
wouldnt
actively
seek
this
out
this
adirondack
amber
is
too
plain
i
could
drink
dozens
of
these
there
is
just
little
to
no
flavor
could
use
this
for
a
good
game
of
beirut
beer
pong
another
bottle
out
of
the
12
beer
holiday
sampler
pours
an
attractive
golden
amber
medium
head
which
disappears
in
a
flash
and
minimal
lacing
down
the
pint
glass
label
says
cascade
and
hallertaur
hops
are
present
but
not
much
of
anything
is
noticed
on
the
nose
except
for
slight
hop
notes
mouthfeel
is
decent
with
adequate
carbonation
and
nicely
balanced
hops
and
malt
interaction
this
is
a
medium
bodied
lager
that
is
well
balanced
overall
with
light
malt
touches
nothing
exceptional
but
i
wouldnt
have
to
be
arm
twisted
to
have
another
brilliantly
clear
auric
hue
with
a
thick
steadfast
dense
cream
white
head
supported
by
lively
bubbling
belgian
lace
remains
soft
caramel
and
husky
grain
upfront
in
aroma
are
contrasted
by
a
gentle
floral
hop
nose
herbal
hallertauer
hints
surface
as
the
brew
breathes
clean
and
tame
aromawise
flavorwise
it
exhibits
a
stately
biscuit
sweetness
which
is
partially
offset
by
balmy
hop
bitterness
hop
flavor
is
far
more
herbal
and
chlorophyll
like
that
the
aroma
implied
hersbrucker
agreeably
understated
in
caramel
malt
character
with
only
subtle
light
toffee
tones
citrusy
hints
surface
as
it
warms
but
are
overshadowed
by
the
noble
hop
flavor
after
the
initial
prickly
carbonic
acid
bite
diminishes
the
mouthfeel
is
revealed
to
be
mildly
dextrinous
and
passably
viscous
finishes
bittersweet
with
floral
rose
like
hints
balanced
with
a
continuation
of
light
caramel
a
surprisingly
balanced
and
enjoyable
beer
from
an
overall
lackluster
brewery
sufficient
in
malt
and
hop
depth
to
keep
the
palate
interested
tasty
but
not
outstanding
drinkability
a
decent
beer
but
not
all
that
impressive
worth
trying
once
but
wont
try
again
poured
with
a
decent
white
head
and
a
very
clear
light
amber
color
nice
aroma
of
cascades
with
a
ligt
toffeeish
sweet
background
fairly
good
body
has
a
slight
thickness
too
it
but
not
chewy
hops
are
really
nicely
balanced
very
easy
to
drink
very
good
beer
this
was
clearly
a
better
beer
than
many
other
ambers
a
coppery
amber
color
with
little
head
to
speak
of
a
flowery
smell
and
a
slightly
hoppy
taste
well
balanced
just
the
right
amount
of
malt
i
enjoyed
this
quite
a
bit
much
better
than
their
ipa
poured
a
dirty
white
head
with
no
staying
power
the
beer
is
clear
amber
in
color
with
a
slight
orange
hue
the
aroma
is
of
grassy
hop
hops
the
flavor
is
hoppy
sweet
and
balanced
by
a
bit
of
barley
its
a
pretty
good
tasting
easy
drinking
lager
skip
the
traditional
lager
and
head
straight
to
the
adirondack
amber
certainly
less
assertive
than
boston
lager
but
almost
as
drinkable
this
matches
up
with
the
yuengling
lager
pretty
well
too
an
overall
easy
drinking
beer
a
nice
orange
copper
colored
amber
filled
my
pint
glass
with
a
decent
head
the
smell
was
slightly
floral
with
some
sweetness
of
the
malt
the
flavor
was
mellow
only
some
slight
bitterness
with
a
somewhat
fruity
flavor
it
was
partially
dry
on
the
tongue
and
there
was
a
small
tinge
of
metallic
residue
in
the
aftertaste
some
lacing
was
produced
on
the
glass
and
the
carbonation
level
was
fine
i
was
very
surprised
by
this
beer
it
sort
of
reminded
me
of
sam
adams
lager
toned
down
a
bit
with
a
touch
of
cascade
hops
a
great
session
beer
clear
medium
amber
color
small
white
head
that
quickly
recedes
and
leaves
no
lace
aroma
is
some
caramel
backed
with
a
solid
earthy
hoppiness
flavor
has
a
good
caramel
malty
start
switching
over
midway
to
a
nice
and
tasty
hoppy
ending
medium

clean
and
balanced

pretty
easy
summer
sipper
my
friend
and
i
shared
a
six
pack
on
my
porch
last
night
and
couldnt
have
been
happier
poured
a
deep
golden
color
with
a
white
head
that
receded
into
a
decent
ring
around
the
edge
and
had
some
nice
lacing
smell
was
a
tad
indistinct
but
there
was
some
floral
notes
pushing
through
with
a
wheaty
malt
taste
was
more
floral
with
the
added
sensation
of
raspberry
not
too
much
in
the
way
of
a
hop
bite
carbonation
was
medium
with
some
nice
spritziness
very
easy
drinker
and
saranac
is
always
a
good
cheap
alternative
when
you
cant
make
it
to
the
beer
store
or
are
low
on
cash
this
is
a
very
refreshing
and
nice
example
of
a
vienna
lager
from
saranac
nice
hopmalt
balance
with
a
pleasant
mouthfeel
i
e
not
overly
carbonated
this
would
make
a
great
session
beer
and
it
is
widely
available
as
well
i
was
impressed
by
the
smoothness
and
the
subtle
hop
bitterness
overall
a
great
summertime
brew
to
pound
away
i
thought
this
was
a
good
beer
it
didnt
have
anything
about
it
that
made
it
stand
out
and
above
other
beers
in
this
category
it
had
a
nice
fruity
and
bitter
hop
flavor
it
wasnt
overpowering
like
some
other
beers
like
this
i
have
had
it
wqas
very
nice
i
would
probably
buy
a
six
pack
of
this
adirondack
amber
has
a
nice
coppertone
appearance
with
a
mediumsized
shortlived
head
aroma
is
okay
with
faint
hints
of
caramel
taste
is
better
than
average
as
far
as
amber
ales
go
with
a
nice
balance
of
malts
and
hops
mouthfeel
is
smooth
nothing
to
shout
about
and
the
drinkability
is
good
this
is
a
great
brew
to
drink
around
a
barbecue
pit
its
also
a
decent
introduction
to
better
crafted
beers
light
amber
in
color
some
malty
wheaty
notes
on
the
aroma
decent
head
and
some
light
lacing
malt
dominated
underlying
sweetness
dry
hops
detected
nice
toasty
and
wheaty
taste
throughout
medium
bodied
quite
tasty
and
enjoyable
one
of
the
matt
brew
cos
best
offerings
i
like
this
one
its
a
good
american
amber
a
very
drinkable
session
took
awhile
to
figure
out
if
this
was
a
lager
or
ale
its
fairly
well
hidden
information
aroma
starts
off
with
a
blast
of
malt
then
moves
to
the
classic
shot
of
citrus
from
the
cascade
hops
the
aroma
eventually
settles
to
a
really
pleasant
mix
of
malt
and
hops
simultaneously
but
is
just
too
light
head
is
smallish
and
leaves
very
quickly
leaving
only
a
ring
around
the
edge
clear
and
amber
as
i
guess
the
name
would
imply
pretty
nice
mix
of
malt
and
hops
with
heavier
emphasis
on
the
hops
just
lacking
in
intensity
for
my
tastes
slight
citrus
with
some
bitterness
neither
is
excessive
and
there
is
a
decent
malt
backing
when
colder
it
seems
the
malt
could
be
stronger
but
that
seems
less
so
as
warms
feel
has
strong
presence
of
carbonation
with
a
thin
body
seems
lager
like
some
softenss
and
fluffiness
too
this
is
okay
a
little
thin
almost
watery
like
lacking
depth
of
character
and
boldness
just
not
satisfying
in
the
end
i
suppose
you
could
drink
a
bunch
yeah
yeah
yeah
but
why
wheres
the
fun
the
beer
pours
a
dark
golden
amber
color
it
creates
a
frothy
white
head
that
fades
to
a
thin
lace
the
aroma
is
of
american
2row
barley
the
taste
is
bitter
with
a
malty
undertone
the
cascade
hops
used
make
it
a
bit
to
bitter
for
me
especially
without
enough
flavor
hopping
the
hallertauer
hops
alow
only
a
faint
hint
of
hop
aroma
the
body
is
low
to
med
making
it
a
very
drinkable
beer
but
not
one
of
my
favorites
for
sure
enjoyed
this
one
certainly
worth
a
6
pack
purchase
definitely
the
best
of
the
saranacs
ive
had
my
second
good
experience
with
a
saranac
offering
this
beer
has
a
good
looking
clear
reddish
amber
body
with
2
fingers
of
golden
light
tan
head
the
head
dissipated
a
bit
too
quickly
but
left
plenty
of
sticky
lace
behind
malty
nose
with
slight
hop
notes
plenty
of
grainy
bready
malt
in
the
taste
with
bittery
hops
hanging
around
every
nook
and
cranny
this
is
a
crazy
mixed
up
kid
of
an
amber
with
no
coherent
message
in
the
flavor
good
but
confusing
to
the
palate
slightly
creamy
body
with
a
crispness
that
seems
forced
could
use
some
refinement
pours
out
an
amber
color
as
implied
by
the
name
bit
of
a
fluffy
white
head
that
went
away
after
a
bit
good
lacing
though
tough
to
put
my
finger
tounge
on
the
taste
nothing
stands
out
on
its
own
its
a
pretty
sweet
tasting
beer
this
probably
isnt
one
that
i
would
seek
out
nothing
horrible
though
transparent
and
light
colored
more
orange
than
amber
this
beer
had
a
frothy
head
with
lots
of
big
lager
carbonation
and
a
decent
stringy
lace
nose
was
a
quiet
fruit
with
a
firm
malt
background
taste
was
a
nice
balance
of
malt
and
hops
with
quiet
fruit
hints
in
time
it
built
to
a
light
nut
taste
too
imo
the
bitterness
could
be
better
tasting
and
tempered
long
dry
finish
and
the
mouthfeel
was
more
watery
than
anything
else
very
simple
and
light
and
easy
to
drink
good
for
a
cheap
summer
beer
nice
amber
color
with
a
white
head
the
head
leaves
fast
and
there
was
little
lace
present
the
aroma
was
sweet
malt
caramel
the
taste
match
the
aroma
but
had
a
slightly
bitter
finish
i
guess
there
are
thecascade
and
hallertauer
hops
are
hanging
out
a
bit
above
average
brew
sweet
malts
and
bready
yeasts
fight
for
my
attention
and
the
hops
take
a
back
seat
until
the
finish
nothing
spectacular
here
but
an
easy
drinker
and
a
great
beer
ratio
a
clear
amber
body
lies
beneath
a
sturdy
head
of
creamy
offwhite
froth
its
retention
is
good
and
it
maintains
a
thin
surface
covering
throughout
most
of
the
pint
nice
lacing
adds
to
the
appearance
the
f
x
matt
yeast
lends
a
gentle
touch
of
fruit
to
some
light
malt
and
background
hops
its
medium
body
combines
with
a
fine
median
carbonation
thats
just
lightly
crisp
on
the
tongue
its
smooth
but
also
a
bit
lifeless
a
light
citrus
hop
flavor
melds
with
a
gently
caramel
malt
and
wellbalanced
bitterness
some
fruity
notes
make
a
minor
appearance
it
finishes
short
and
dry
its
not
a
complex
beer
by
any
stretch
but
it
is
an
enjoyable
beer
with
enough
character
to
keep
it
interesting
beyond
one
a
very
drinkable
and
good
session
beer
this
is
a
drinkable
beer

and

with
a

a

no

a
beer
designed
to
be

it

fine

this
beer
has
a
quickly
dissipating

that
is
artificially
carbonated
i
am
getting
a
nice
undertone
of
a
hop
aroma
along
with
sweetness
in
the
sniff
i
took
the
overall
taste
is
a
bit
unbalanced
between
the
bittering
hops
and
the
caramel
and
two

sweetness
the
hop
profile
within
the
flavor
saves
this
beer
and
gives
it
a

i
like
the
aftertaste
this

leaves
on

but
the
inital
tast
isn

as
pleasant
to
me
as
i
was
hoping
when
it
comes
down
to
it
this
beer
is
not
a
winner
in
my
book
and
it
doesnt
even
work
as
session
brew
for
my
tastebuds
mediocre
and
better
than
a
macro
but
the
flavors
are
all
toned
down
in
order
to
work
as
a
cross
over
from
flavorless
to
flavorful
i
would
put
this
beer
in
between
those
two
dont
plan
on
having
another
glad
there
was
only
one
in
the
sampler
nice
malty
carmel
aroma
light
amber
in
color
with
a
nice
white
head
that
left
a
fair
amount
of
lace
taste
wise
was
kind
of
oily
malt
taste
with
not
much
hops
i
agree
with
some
other
reviews
that
something
is
missing
from
this
brew
overall
a
decent
beer
thats
easy
to
drink
of
the
saranac
line
so
far
this
is
the
better
one
i
cant
wait
to
try
some
of
the
other
selections
it
doesnt
quite
have
the
refinement
and
balance
of
other
amber
lagers
but
it
tasted
pretty
good
to
me
not
very
impressed
pours
a
light
penny
copper
color
with
a
white
head
that
leaves
rather
quickly
leaving
a
lace
behind
the
smell
of
nothing
doesnot
fill
any
part
of
nose
i
am
very
surprised
at
this
beer
i
like
most
of
the
saranac
stuff
oh
well
i
guess
i
will
leave
it
for
my
wife
pours
a
pleasant
amber
with
a
foamy
head
the
head
stays
around
for
more
than
a
few
drinks
that
adds
a
hoppy
aroma
nothing
extraordinary
about
any
particular
area
its
just
an
average
beer
the
taste
is
pleasing
and
does
not
leave
an
unpleasant
after
taste
its
a
descent
addition
to
the
variety
pack
and
would
be
welcome
to
any
gathering
i
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
buy
it
but
wouldnt
pass
it
up
either
a
slight
harsh
hoppy
aroma
and
flavor
at
first
but
then
the
maltiness
comes
in
and
evens
things
out
not
great
but
not
bad
will
drink
again
if
i
am
given
some
but
i
would
not
go
out
and
search
for
it
pours
a
nice
amber
red
hue
malty
flavor
really
nice
medium
bodied
beer
not
really
much
bitterness
or
hoppiness
just
a
smooth
moderately
malty
beer
would
make
a
good
session
beer
beer
8
of
the
12
pack
sampler
gets
a
thumbs
up
fom
me
this
beer
pours
a
sparkling
clear
copper
color
with
amber
highlights
i
sports
a
decent
whitish
head
that
slowly
recedes
into
a
layer
of
foamy
film
it
leaves
a
respectable
lacing
behind
perhaps
there
is
a
strong
malt
backgorund
in
this
beer
hmmmm
lets
find
out
the
aroma
is
very
much
malt
bringing
hints
of
some
of
my
favorite
bourbons
to
mind
maybe
a
hint
of
hops
in
there
as
well
nothing
really
spectacular
the
first
sip
reveals
a
prominent
sweetness
up
front
with
some
decent
bitterness
in
the
finish
there
is
a
grassy
note
to
the
finish
and
aftertatse
after
a
few
more
tastes
a
bit
more
of
the
herbal
taste
comes
thorugh
along
with
some
citrus
hop
flavors
tastes
like
the
brewers
used
some
cascade
hops
in
this
one
as
well
should
have
read
the
bottle
more
closely
the
mouthfeel
is
average
but
matches
the
flavor
profile
well
not
quite
the
malty
flavor
and
body
that
i
was
hoping
for
after
seeing
the
residual
foam
on
the
beer
overall
this
is
another
decent
beer
from
saranac
the
adirondack
amber
poured
an
attractive
color
true
to
its
name
a
very
thin
head
was
wellretained
throughout
the
tasting
the
smell
was
of
a
sweet
strong
maltiness
with
only
the
slightest
hint
of
hops
this
strong
malt
presence
was
reiterated
in
the
taste
but
the
the
hops
asserted
themselves
a
little
more
here
a
good
fairly
wellbalanced
taste
was
perceived
it
went
away
a
little
too
quickly
at
first
but
stuck
around
later
on
in
the
tasting
i
liked
the
taste
but
expected
a
little
more
maybe
it
was
the
hint
of
pure
adirondack
water
on
the
label
the
amber
has
a
nice
mouthfeel
to
it
with
a
medium
body
and
pleasing
efferevescence
overall
the
adirondack
amber
lager
was
drinkable
and
i
wouldnt
be
disappointed
if
this
beer
was
slated
for
a
session
not
bad
but
not
great
middle
of
the
line
cheers
drinkability
notes
not
bad
but
this
is
no
sam
adams
lager
many
breweries
take
on
the
amber
lager
and
come
up
with
a
less
then
par
take
on
what
should
be
a
clean
flavourful
lager
this
is
does
have
flavour
just
not
in
the
right
places
sort
of
a
jumbled
mess
that
is
hard
for
the
taste
buds
to
decipher
not
an
amber
that
makes
you
want
to
jump
up
and
down
but
overall
pretty
pleasant
a
little
raw
in
the
hops
department
up
front
but
the
malt
rolls
in
to
take
charge
a
touch
of
tin
in
the
finish
but
not
enough
to
throw
it
off
the
weakness
to
me
lies
in
the
drinkability
of
this
product
it
feels
a
tad
heavy
however
it
could
be
an
aquired
taste
why
not
its
got
a
nice
lable
cheers
a
prototype
amber
beer
nothing
really
stands
out
no
mistakes
either
very
malty
and
mellow
a
great
cigar
beer
nothing
too
complex
going
on
here
but
that
isnt
necessarily
a
bad
thing
amber
color
duh
with
a
medium
creamy
head
and
sweet
aroma
another
winner
from
saranac
this
may
be
their
best
allaround
beer
its
the
malts
theyre
terrific
and
distinctive
in
every
beer
they
brew
matt
brewers
expertly
straddle
the
divide
between
oldtime
classic
american
lagers
and
the
recent
microbrew
explosion
this
example
is
such
a
well
rounded
beer
that
it
is
suitable
for
almost
anything
heftier
than
a
golden
lager
piney
hops
that
make
it
refreshing
sweet
caramel
malts
to
deepen
the
flavor
its
all
good
and
i
like
it
not
bad
at
all
this
brew
drinks
rich
smooth
and
flavourful
no
stiking
or
strong
senses
just
solid
tastey
balance
one
on
saranacs
best
cheers
smooth
and
refreshing
this
beer
was
a
bit
lighter
than
i
had
expected
but
it
had
just
enough
flavor
for
me
to
have
a
few
more
i
wouldnt
call
it
complex
but
it
was
not
your
ordinary
beer
206
not
bad
nice
golden
color
is
typical
of
ambers
pleasant
hop
and
two
row
malt
flavor
make
this
brew
very
refreshing
and
quite
drinkable
thin
white
head
quickly
disappears
hoppy
aroma
and
dark
strawcolor
nice
balance
between
initial
sweetness
and
bitter
finish
this
beer
offers
nothing
spectacular
but
was
enjoyable
nonetheless
more
gold
in
color
than
a
traditional
amber
fluffy
white
head
slight
malt
nose
with
a
hint
of
metalic
odor
musty
malt
taste
with
a
slightly
bitter
finish
smooth
feel
with
good
body
to
the
brew
but
the
taste
is
slightly
skunkymusty
not
one
of
the
best
amber
beers
i
have
had
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
saranac
have
a
pils
possibly
my
favorite
in
the
saranac
lineup
honey
colored
with
a
slight
chill
haze
rocky
offwhite
head
dissipates
to
swirls
of
lacy
thin
bubbles
clean
slightly
malty
aroma
balanced
with
some
tangy
hop
fragrance
taste
is
nicely
balanced
with
an
initial
hop
bitterness
that
hits
your
tongue
then
gives
to
a
smooth
clean
malty
finish
some
fruitiness
in
there
as
well
nicely
done
not
a
bad
looking
amber
but
very
simple
i
like
a
little
more
body
to
my
ambers
this
beer
has
a
pretty
smooth
finish
and
isnt
at
all
offensive
to
the
taste
buds
this
is
a
beautiful
looking
beera
very
nice
copper
color
not
all
that
much
flavor
which
is
possibly
why
it
is
so
easy
to
drink
a
good
amber
very
clear
light
amber
with
a
healthy
head
that
has
retention
nice
little
hop
boquet
pretty
nice
tasting
beer
here
its
got
some
bitterness
not
as
much
clean
maltiness
as
id
like
in
an
amber
lager
but
it
does
have
a
crispness
that
is
appropriate
for
lagers
medium
bodied
slight
lingering
bitterness
pretty
nice
beer
here
pours
a
light
amber
color
with
a
smallish
creamy
head
that
sticks
around
for
a
little
while
nice
malty
caramel
aromas
taste
is
sweet
caramel
malt
with
some
light
hops
thrown
in
to
balance
it
out
the
malt
is
the
first
thing
to
hit
the
tongue
with
the
hops
lingering
in
the
background
before
they
get
more
agressive
towards
the
end
of
the
sip
sticky
mouthfeel
and
pretty
drinkable
i
think
that
this
beer
would
be
nice
on
milder
spring
and
fall
evenings
it
isnt
quite
light
enough
of
body
to
have
me
drinking
it
in
the
summer
time
or
heavy
enough
for
the
winter
it
isnt
something
that
i
would
seek
out
but
i
would
fall
back
on
it
in
a
bar
or
take
it
if
offered
saranac
classifies
this
beer
as
a
classic
german
amber
lager
whatever
better
than
average
imho
spidery
clinging
head
balanced
nose
lasting
taste
and
mouthfeel
but
i
didnt
detect
a
lot
of
cascade
hop
feel
that
the
label
mentioned
good
but
not
outstanding
i
guess
this
is
whats
mixed
with
the
stout
to
make
the
saranac
black
and
tan
i
have
a
soft
spot
for
amber
lagers
new
amsterdams
amber
is
that
one
still
around
used
to
be
my
old
standby
way
back
when
theyre
nice
starter
beers
whether
youre
starting
an
evening
or
just
starting
to
drink
micros
for
the
first
time
this
one
is
a
nice
clean
example
with
enough
malt
flavor
and
bitterness
to
keep
it
interesting
i
tell
you
these
saranac
variety
cases
are
pretty
good
nice
golden
amber
color
fully
lagared
to
balance
the
sweetness
malt
malty
in
smell
with
hints
of
hops
and
some
sort
of
citrus
the
taste
is
fairly
mild
malty
and
smooth
but
mostly
one
dimensional
delicate
bitterness
overall
a
drinkable
beer
though
this
is
another
solid
offering
from
saranac
though
i
admit
it
not
my
first
choice
its
still
a
welcome
changeup
substantial
body
and
flavor
nice
balance
of
hops
and
malt
has
an
earthy
taste
that
is
very
enjoyable
this
is
a
beer
you
should
sit
and
drink
with
friends
also
there
wasnt
any
freshness
date
anywhere
on
the
bottle
a
good
but
not
great
beer
like
killians
but
much
better
notes
a
very
nice
american
stab
at
a
german
amber
lager
too
bad
there
was
only
one
of
these
in
their
mixed
6pak
i
could
really
go
for
another
o
didnt
enjoy
the
flavor
nothing
about
this
screamed
pilsner
love
this
beer
cool
can
great
fishing
beer
an
interesting
beer
no
doubt
the
first
to
use
the
belma
hops
discovered
growing
wild
on
a
farm
in
the
yakima
vallley
its
slightly
hazy
in
the
glass
perhaps
from
dryhopping
and
topped
by
a
fluffy
head
of
bright
white
the
head
retention
is
quite
good
as
is
the
lacing
left
behind
in
the
nose
its
a
touch
minty
softly
grassy
delicately
floral
and
subtly
fruity
apple
over
a
straightforward
grainy
golden
malt
base
the
same
hop
components
remain
in
the
flavor
with
the
almost
spearmint
like
mintyness
stepping
forward
its
not
very
bitter
and
therefore
the
malt
seems
quite
solid
and
somewhat
sweetish
yet
it
remains
balanced
overall
however
the
two
components
dont
really
seem
to
mesh
well
the
hops
appear
backed
by
the
malt
and
it
pretty
much
stays
that
way
until
the
swallow
where
the
bitterness
comes
up
a
bit
as
do
the
more
grassy
flavors
of
the
hops
on
the
other
hand
a
little
less
malt
would
leave
the
beer
lacking
overall
it
remains
interesting
enjoyable
and
refreshing
worth
trying
o
a
little
tasty
goes
down
easily
not
too
filling
mild
kick
good
representation
of
style
this
is
a
decent
poundable
beer
to
drink
for
a
long
time
if
youre
in
the
mood
for
the
style
a
decent
pils
i
would
like
to
see
it
a
touch
drier
and
perhaps
a
touch
more
grassy
but
the
flavors
are
on
point
for
the
style

the
head
settles
down
leaving
some

the

is
just
the
slightest

noble

and
the
taste
is
also
barely
there
nice

and
feel
to

wish
this
was
more

everything

about

is
a

dry
however
of
perhaps
overdone
or
singular
in
nature
malt
breakdown
not
very
characteristic
for
a
pils
yet
not
bad
either
feel
is
decent
and
full
given
the
hop
presence
as
such
this
drinks
more
like
a
light
belgian
pale
than
a
german
pils
still
it
struggles
with
a
very
short
finish
still
id
buy
it
again
an
interesting
offering
od
definitely
not
my
cuppa
the
hop
profile
is
definitely
not
prevalent
and
it
ends
up
being
closer
to
a
european
adjunct
lager
not
worth
the
time
pours
clear
golden

nice

with

nice

ill
take
another

bottle
the
verdict
surprisingly
good
the
wild
hops
give
it
a
nice
flavor
and
a
hint
of
complexity
good
session
beer
at
a
good
price
pours
a
golden
body
with
a
small
white
head
with
good
retention
and
a
bit
of
lacing
aromas
are
sweet
and
practically
epitomize
the
word
grassy
i
get
a
light
citrusy
note
as
well
taste
is
very
balanced
between
english
muffinlike
malts
and
grassy
hops
with
an
orange
peel
prickle
grains

long
on
the
finish
i
like
this
a
lot
very
solid
the
flavor
snaps
with
a
pleasing
hop
profile
that
demonstrates
more
of
the
melon
flavors
not
bad
and
a
steal
for
the
price
o
i
enjoyed
this
beer
although
i
kept
going
back
to
adirondack
lager
for
its
bready
more
classic
noble
hoppiness
more
refreshing
and
flavorful
at
once
wild
hop
pils
is
pretty
good
but
there
are
many
better
bohemian
and
german
pils
out
there
this
one
treads
the
line
between
the
two
although
tends
more
to
the
german
side
i
just
love
the
sound
of
a
good
crack
in
the
morning
leave
it
to
saranac
to
brighten
the
day
with
something
wild
i
celebrated
with
an
inverted
glug
and
then
sat
back
and
watched
the
pseudocascade
it
developed
into
twoplus

with
great

srm

with
nequality
clarity
of
course
this
acted
as
the
clarion
call
for
midas
mammon
and
croesus
to
show
up
and
begin
squabbling
amongst
themselves
for
a
taste
i
can
hardly
put
up
with
it
any
more
nose
had
an
earthy
peppery
bite
and
i
was
inspired
to
ask
my
neighbor
to
plant
peppers
next
year
mouthfeel
was
medium
the
taste
was
very
earthy
like
something
freshly
harvested
wethopped
perhaps
it
also
had
a
cereallike
maltiness
so
i
would
put
it
as
a
germanstyle
pils
finish
was
crisp
and
dry
and
would
make
an
excellent
addition
to
the
cooler
on
a
hot
humid
summers
day
mouthfeel
is
light
and
crisp
with
a
medium
body
average
carbonation
and
a
bready
finish
thats
on
the
dry
side
and
clean
overall
a
very
nice
pils
that
is
much
hoppier
than
most
pils
and
much
more
flavorful
overall
a
great
session
beer
and
a
very
good
buy
the
label
is
awful
in
opinion
if
it
werent
for
the
price
i
would
have
overlooked
it
ps
i
love
my
wife
o
an
interesting
beer
worth
trying
for
the
rare
belman
hops
o
overall
it
is
light
crispy
and
has
a
touch
of
zing
i
appreciate
that
they
are
trying
to
showcase
a
new
hop
but
the
hops
upstage
the
style
still
a
good
beer
and
would
be
great
for
hot
days
light
and
clear
in
color
decent
head
good
lacing
i
was
a
little
hesitant
having
tried
other
pilseners
that
were
overhopped
this
is
a
good
pilsener
dry
and
moderately
hoppy
slightly
toasty
well
balanced
a
very
good
product
good
for
a
summer
day
i
would
drink
it
again
its
inoffensive
but
doesnt
give
the
pils
angle
justice
looks
and
aroma
brings
some
goods
but
the
package
doesnt
deliver
one
of
a
handful
of
my
current
favorites
pours
a
deep
golden
color
with
fine
clarity
the
foamy
white
head
sticks
around
forever
it
seems
and
for
sure
looks
inviting
underneath
the
veil
of
froth
the
aroma
is
bright
and
hoppy
with
some
toasted
bread
in
the
taste
citrus
and
some
dirtier
earthier
aspects
has
a
light
spiciness
to
the
hops
as
well
the
body
is
light
and
decently
carbonated
and
the
finish
has
a
clean
citrus
to
it
overall
matt
brewing
knows
how
to
make
easy
drinking
beers
and
this
is
no
exception
a
nice
option
if
youre
looking
into
pilsner
a
good
beer
with
no
faults
other
then
needing
more
hops
o
overall
good
drinkability
softly
balanced
making
for
prime
session
material
wont
blow
you
out
hop
wise
but
is
more
subtle
and
traditional
finishing
out
with
a
spicy
bite
perfect
for
that
warm
summer
day
in
the
backyard
the
hops
seem
to
get
more
appreciable
deeper
into
the
drink
o
refreshing
when
cold
disappointing
warming
up
light
fully
clear
gold
colored
beer
aroma
is
sweet
chewy
grains
vienna
like
malt
and
crisp
grass
floral
citrus
and
a
soft
presence
of
strawberry
ice
cream
taste
is
nicely
grainy
as
well
fruity
berries
creamy
malt
light
lemon
peel
citrus
as
the
bitterness
hits
not
really
a
pilsner
but
definitely
a
refreshing
lager
with
a
unique
hop
profile
one
of
saranacs
best
beers
this
is
a
success
clear
gold
with
a
hefty
head
of
bigbubbled
foam
smells
fruity
and
floral
with
some
lightly
sweet
toasted
grain
and
a
hint
of
grass
i
definitely
get
that
berrylike
aroma
that
comes
from
belma
hops
though
its
subtle
a
little
too
much
caramel
breadiness
in
the
flavor
upfront
for
a
pilsner
but
the
strawberry
citrus
and
melon
quickly
blends
in
resulting
in
a
fairly
unique
pale
lager
it
actually
results
in
something
closer
to
a
vienna
lager
with
a
hoppy
twist
light
but
not
without
a
certain
creaminess
before
finishing
crisp
ignoring
the
pils
on
the
label
this
is
a
fine
drinkable
lager
o
whether
a
more
traditional
pilsner
or
a
good
lager
a
fine
summer
refresher
with
more
substance
to
it
than
most
pilsners
and
some
lagers
today
given
the
name
however
hopheads
will
be
disappointed
unless
they
see
the
ibus
ahead
of
time
on
the
bottle
neck
o
i
found
this
to
be
a
very
nice
offering
from
saranac
that
goes
down
easily
but
is
very
tasty
the
use
of
the
belma
hops
added
pleasant
citrusy
aromas
and
flavors
these
make
it
more
like
an
ipa
than
a
pilsner
so
i
would
have
labeled
this
as
a
wild
hop
ipl
overall
great
beer
for
the
price
a
keeper
love
it
i
could
not
wait
to
buy
this
beer
again
this
year
overall
fantastic
crisp
summer
refresher
in
my
opinion
way
underrated
in
this
forum
overall
not
worth
picking
up
again
in
a
way
its
actual
not
a
bad
pilsnerlager
but
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
the
style
in
the
least
sorry
not
worth
going
back
to
five
more
saranacs
to
go
in
this
mix
pack
o
solid
more
as
a
generic
lager
than
as
a
pilsner
however
would
be
a
decent
summer
quaffer
especially
given
the
cans
and
the
modest
5
2
abv
extremely
well
balanced
with
a
pretty
unique
hoppiness
though
not
too
far
off
the
deep
end
simply
just
subtle
which
is
all
that
is
really
needed
in
a
highly
drinkable
pils
overall
a
great
little
pilsner
great
appearance
aroma
taste
and
at
a
great
price
too
especially
for
this
experimental
beer
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
i
have
had
anything
from
saranac
but
i
used
to
love
the
lagers
they
put
out
i
will
seek
out
more
yellow
color
with
moderate
carbonation
and
moderate
head
usual
suspects
in
aroma
average
appearance
and
aroma
tastes
better
than
it

it
has
more
depth
than
you
might
suspect

a

the
belma

i
have
had
in

beers
works
surprising
well
with

this
is
for
sure
my
favorite
belma
hops
beer
i
hope
they
continue
to
make
this
beer
it
is
pretty
different
and
also
pretty
good

beers
and
its
soso
beers
and
this
is
one
of
the
better
ones
ive
tried

still
packs
a

i
hope
saranac
will
someday
distribute
this
in
6ers

12ers
as
ive
never
seen
them
before
highly
recommend

a

unexpected
in

definitely
profiles
as
a
thicker
grainier
version
taste
a
taut
ping
that
resounds
then
a
malty
base
of
hops
keeps
this
less
dense
and
less
wild
than
expected
heavier
aftertaste
as
well
doesnt
endear
overall
a
bit
warming
as
the
glass
drains
a
different
experience
when
arranged
with
others
of
the
same
style
overall
a
compliment
to
saranac
that
it
is
a
unique
product
by
their
standards
brewed
with
the
newly
discovered
belma
hops
i
like
this
pilsener
that
has
a
lot
more
hop
flavor
than
most
of
these
do
its
got
an
enticing
pale
yellow
color
but
the
head
falls
down
a
bit
struggles
to
maintain
itself
the
nose
is
hoppy
for
the
style
lots
of
darker
fruits
amongst
the
mold
bitterness
and
very
unique
complexion
the
pilsener
malts
appear
german
to
me
light
and
dusty
with
that
cornbread
sort
of
sweetness
but
much
more
delicate
the
flavor
is
just
like
the
nose
with
the
hops
actually
taking
a
bit
of
a
back
seat
to
the
grains
although
the
hops
are
very
interesting
and
new
to
my
palate
i
get
an
almost
blackberry
flavor
in
the
finish
u
really
like
this
in
the
summer
mix
ultra
light
in
body
and
impressively
clean
in
the
finish
but
still
bringing
a
lot
of
flavor
this
is
really
nice
in
the
summer
a
beer
i
will
happily
return
to
when
it
is
around
maybe
the
surprise
of
this
years
beers
of
summer
its
unusual
not
bad
though
id
drink
this
again
its
solid
poured
from
a
bottle
into
a
stemmed
pilsner
glass
the
beer
is
a
crystal
clear
straw
yellow
coloring
with
a
frothy
clingy
bright
white
head
and
champagne
amounts
of
carbonation
bubbling
toasted

with
a
honey

floral
backbone
and
resiny
overlay
roasty
and
sweet
aftertaste
with
a
dry
feel
at

great
clinging

as
you
drink

sam
adams
reintroduced
to
the

with
their
noble

back

what

mouthfeel

crisp

ample

sip
rolling
overall
a
tasty
summer
beer
i
hope
to
see
it
available
in
six
packs
overall
a
tasty
easy
drinking
pils
enjoyable
overall
this
is
a
good
beer
but
not
something
i
would
seek
out
just
because
it
isnt
a
very
exciting
beer
well
worth
the
money
though
and
great
to
share
with
noncraft
beer
drinkers
there
is
nothing
really
outstanding
about
this
drink
its
enjoyable
and
refreshing
you
could
almost
guzzle
it
like
tea
its
basically
a
very
lightly
hoppy
floral
brew
that
works
well
with
hot
days
i
probably
wouldnt
get
this
again
but
id
drink
it
again
this
shouldnt
be
classified
as
an
american
wild
ale
because
it
is
a
pilsner
the
hops
can
be
found
more
clearly
in
the
taste
after
i
get
that
quick
grain
note
low
bitterness
and
highly
drinkable
warm
weather
beer
i
thought
it
was
pretty
good
